      <field name="fulltext">TO ALL FRIENDLY READERS. There are, who love upon their knees To linger when their prayers are said, And lengthen out their Litanies, In duteous care for quick and dead. Thou, of all Love the Source and Guide! O may some hovering thought of theirs, Where I am kneeling, gently glide, And higher waft these earth-bound prayers. There are, who gazing on the stars Love-tokens read from worlds of light, Not as dim-seen through prison-bars, But as with Angels' welcome bright. O had we kept entire the vow And covenant of our infant eyes, We too might trace untrembling now Glad lessons in the moonlight skies. There are, to whom the gay green earth Might seem a mournful penance cave; For they have marr'd their holy birth, Have rent the bowers that o'er them wave. Where underneath Thy Cross they lie, Mark me a place: Thy Mercy's ray Is healing, even to such as I, Else wherefore bid us hope and pray? What if there were, who laid one hand Upon the Lyre of Innocence, While the other, over sea and land Beckoned foul shapes, in dream intense Of earthly Passion? Whoso reads, In pity kneel for him, and pour A deep heart-prayer (O! much it needs) That lies may be his hope no more. Pray that the mist, by sin and shame Left on his soul, may fleet; that he A true and timely word may frame For weary hearts, that ask to see Their way in our dim twilight hour; His lips so purged with penance-fire, That he may guide them, in Christ's power Along the path of their desire; And with no faint nor erring voice May to the wanderer whisper, “Stay: God chooses for thee: seal His choice, Nor from thy Mother's shadow stray: For sure thine holy Mother's shade Rests yet upon thine ancient home: No voice from Heaven hath clearly said, ‘Let us depart;’ then fear to roam.” Pray that the Prayer of Innocents On Earth, of Saints in Heaven above, Guard, as of old, our lonely tents; Till, as one Faith is ours, in Love We own all Churches, and are owned.— Pray Him to save, by chastenings keen, The harps that hail His Bride enthroned From wayward touch of hands unclean. Feb. 8, 1846. I. Holy Baptism. 1. THE MOST HOLY NAME. “Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.” Once in His Name Who made thee, Once in His Name Who died for thee, Once in His Name Who lives to aid thee, We plunge thee in Love's boundless sea. Christian, dear child, we call thee; Threefold the Bath, the Name is One: Henceforth no evil dream befall thee, Now is thy heavenly rest begun. Yet in sharp hours of trial The mighty seal must needs be prov'd: Dread Spirits wait in stern espial:— But name thou still the Name belov'd. Name it with heart untainted, Lips fragrant from their early vow, Ere Conscience yet have swerved or fainted, Ere Shame have dyed the willing brow. Name it in dewy morning, When duly for the world's keen fray With prayer and vow thy soul adorning, Thou in thy bower salut'st the day. In quiet evening name it, When gently, like a wearied breeze, Thou sink'st to sleep; O see thou claim it— That saving Name—upon thy knees. Name it in solemn meetings, 'Mid chanted anthems grave and clear, When toward the East our awful greetings Are wafted ere our Lord appear. Upon thy death-bed name it: So may'st thou chase th' infernal horde, So learn with Angels to proclaim it, Thrice Holy, One Almighty Lord. 2. NEW CREATION. “He hath set the world in their heart.” Who may the wondrous birth declare Of Earth and Heaven so vast and fair? Yet whensoe'er to Love's pure spring A helpless Little One they bring, Those wonders o'er again we see In saving mystery. All in the unregenerate child Is void and formless, dark and wild, Till the life-giving holy Dove Upon the waters gently move, And power impart, soft brooding there, Celestial fruit to bear. God on the first day spake in might, “Let there be Light,” and there was Light. So o'er the Font enlightening grace As surely beams from Jesus' face, As when in Jordan's wave He bow'd Beneath the hovering cloud. The second day, God stored on high The dewy treasures of the sky: And who the pure glad drops may tell, Reserv'd in yon ethereal well, Faith to revive upon her way, Hope's weary thirst allay? The third day dawn'd: at His command The rushing waters left the land, With herb and flower the green earth smil'd: So art thou rescued, Christian Child, From tossings of the world's rude sea, In vernal peace to be. Bright rose the fourth triumphal morn, For then the sun and stars were born, And the soft moon, whose chaste cold ray Tells tidings of a purer day. Christ in the Font became our Noon, The Holy Church, our Moon. To the fifth dawn and eve belong Motion and life, and flight and song, In watery deeps and deeps of Heaven: Such gift to thee, dear babe, was given, When from the earth He bade thee rise To greet Him in the skies. The sixth dread day, the last in place, Dread in its deeps of untold grace, Moulded, at morn, the cold dull clay, Inspired, at eve, the quickening ray; The same sad morn and evening mild Renewed us, earth-defiled. Thee, awful image of the All-good, That one atoning day renew'd For the whole world: the fontal wave To each apart the glory gave, Washing us clean, that we might hide In His love-pierced side. Thus in each day of toil we read Tokens of joy to Saints decreed. What if the day of holy rest The sleep foreshow of infant blest, Borne from the Font, the seal new given, Perchance to wake in Heaven! 3. GUARDIAN ANGELS. “He shall give His Angels charge concerning thee.” “Tell me now thy morning dream.” “In the flowery sweet spring-tide I beheld a sparkling stream, Where by thousands Angels glide; Each beneath the soft bright wing Seem'd a tender babe to bring, Where the freshest waters fell In an ever-living well. Far within the unearthly Font Showed the pure Heaven's steadfast rays, Stars beyond what eye can count Deepening on the unwearied gaze. Whoso of those springs would draw, Wondrous joy and wondrous awe On his soul together rise, Starlight keen and dark blue skies. Round the margin breath'd and bloom'd Flowers from Eden: far below Gems from Heaven the sides illum'd:— But nor flower nor gem might show Half so fair as your soft charms, Who in your own Seraphs' arms Here are wafted, in pure vest Rob'd, and wash'd, and seal'd, and bless'd. There one moment lay immers'd Each bright form, and ere it rose, Rose regenerate, Light would burst From where golden morning glows, With a sudden, silent thrill, Over that mysterious rill. Ne'er so bright, so gentle, sweep Lightnings o'er the summer deep. In a moment came that ray, Came but went not: every sprite, Through its veil of mortal clay, Now is drench'd in quickening light; Light wherewith the Seraphs burn, Light that to itself would turn Whatsoe'er of earth and shame Mars even now the new-born frame. Through the pure Heavens now at large See the immortal guardians soar, Joying to behold their charge Purg'd, wing'd, brighten'd more and more, As the strong undying spark Buoys them upward to God's Ark, To the Throne where all repair With the first-fruits of their care. Ne'er with smile so glad and kind Welcom'd God's High Priest of old Abraham's seed with Abraham's mind Offering gifts from field and fold, Lamb or kid, or first-ripe corn, Glory of the Paschal morn;— When the shades from Salem's wall On Siloah deepest fall;— As in that entrancing dream, On my sleep-embolden'd eyes, From the shrine, the approving beam Thrill'd, as each new sacrifice, Each new living ray, each soul Borne beyond where shadows roll, With its faithful Watcher, found Place in the eternal round.” O sweet morning dream, I pray, Pass not with the matin hour: Charm me:—heart and tongue allay, Thoughts that ache and eyes that lower. From the Fountain to the Shrine Bear me on, thou trance divine; Faint not, fade not on my view, Till I wake and find thee true. 4. BAPTISMAL VOWS. “That which ye have already hold fast till I come.” O happy new-born babe, where art thou lying What are these sounds that fill with healing balm The hallow'd air, of power to still thy crying At once, and nurse thee into heavenly calm? “His Bosom bears me, who on earth descended Of a poor Maid vouchsafing to be born. His saving words, with holy water blended, Have brought the glory to my prime of morn. Joy to thy nurse, more joy to her who bare thee Lamb of that Shepherd's flock, whose name is Good: As He hath won, for ever may He wear thee, And keep thee purified with His dear blood “Amen: and therefore am I sworn His servant, His sacred Heart through life to be my rest, To watch His eye with adoration fervent, Foe of His foes, and in His white robe drest.” O blest, O safe, on God's own bosom leaning! But passion-hours are nigh:—keep thou thy place: And far and wide are evil watchers, gleaning The lambs that slight the Shepherd's fostering grace. “Nay, I will drink His cup; my vow is taken; With His baptizing blood mine own shall blend; Ne'er be that holiest charge by me forsaken, The dying Saviour's trust to each true friend.” Well hast thou sworn, and be thy warfare glorious: But Saints are pure, the Church is undefiled, And Jesus welcom'd from His cross victorious A Virgin Mother to a Virgin Child. “Then ask for me of the dread Son of Mary, Whose arms eternal are young children's home, A loving heart, obedient eyes and wary, Even as I am to tarry till He come.” Prayer shall not fail, but higher He would lead thee: His bosom-friend ate of that awful Bread: So will He wait all day to bless and feed thee;— Come thou adoring to be blest and fed. “'Tis meet and right, and mine own bounden duty. Good Angels guide me with pure heart to fall Before His Altar-step, and see His Beauty, And taste of Him, my first, my last, mine all.” 5. SIGN OF THE CROSS. (See the First Prayer Book of Edward VI.—“Receyve the signe of the Holy Crosse, both in thy forehead, and in thy breste.”) “I will write upon him My new Name.” Where is the mark to Jesus known, Whereby He seals His own? Slaves wore of old on brow and breast Their master's name impress'd, And Christian babes on heart and brow Wear Jesus' token now. His holy Priest that token gave With finger dipt in the life-giving wave. When soldiers take their sovereign's fee, And swear his own to be, The royal badge on forehead bold They show to young and old. Nor may we hide for fear or shame The persecuted Name. Only with downcast eyes we go At thought of sin that God and Angels know. If the dread mark, though dim, be there, The watchers will not bear From spirits unblest or reckless man Unpitying word or ban. “Mine own anointed touch ye not, Nor mine handwriting blot. Where'er my soldiers cross your path, Honour my royal Sign, or fear my wrath.” The Shepherd signs his lambs in haste, Ere on the mountain waste He loose them, far and wide to stray, And whoso mars their way, Or scorns the awful Name they show, That Shepherd counts him foe. Fresh from His arms are these, and sure We read His token here undimm'd and pure. Fresh from th' eternal Arms are these, Or sporting on our knees, Or set on earth with earnest eye And tottering feet, to try Their daily walk, or newly taught Grave prayer and quiet thought. The fragrant breath of their new birth Is round them yet: avaunt, ill airs of earth. Ye elder brethren, think on this! Think on the mighty bliss, Should He, the Friend of babes, one day, The words of blessing say:— “My seal upon My lambs ye knew, And I will honour you:”— And think upon the eternal loss If on their foreheads ye deface the glorious Cross. 6. DEATH OF THE NEW-BAPTIZED. “The dew of Thy birth is of the womb of the morning.” What purer brighter sight on earth, than when The Sun looks down upon a drop of dew, Hid in some nook from all but Angels' ken, And with his radiance bathes it through and through, Then into realms too clear for our frail view Exhales and draws it with absorbing love? And what if Heaven therein give token true Of grace that new-born dying infants prove, Just touch'd with Jesus' light, then lost in joys above? II. Cradle Songs. 1. THE FIRST SMILE For this Poem the Author is indebted to a dear friend.. “Post et ridere cæpi; dormiens primo, deinde vigilans.” August. Confess. i. 8. Tears from the birth the doom must be Of the sin-born—but wait awhile, Young mother, and thine eye shall see The dawning of the first soft smile. It comes in slumber, gently steals O'er the fair cheek, as light on dew; Some inward joy that smile reveals; Sit by and muse; such dreams are true. Closed eyelids, limbs supine, and breath So still, you scarce can calm the doubt If life can be so like to death— 'Tis life, but all of earth shut out. 'Tis perfect peace; yet all the while O'er marble brow, and dimpled chin Mantles and glows that radiant smile, Noting the spirit stirred within. Oh dim to this the flashing ray, Though dear as life to mother's heart, From waking smiles, that later play; In these earth claims the larger part. 'Tis childish sport, or frolic mirth, Or the fond mother's blameless guile, Or glittering toy,—some gaud of earth, That stirs him to that merry smile. Or if in pensive wise it creep, With gradual light and soberer grace, Yet shades of earthly sorrow sleep, Still sleep upon his beauteous face. But did the smile disclose a dream Of bliss that had been his before? Was it from heaven's deep sea a gleam Not faded quite on earth's dim shore? Or told some Angel from above Of glories to be his at last, The sunset, crowning hours of love— His labours done—his perils past? Or, thought of trial for her breast, Did the mild spirits whisper then, “From the Baptismal Font, O blest, Thou shalt be ours, dear child, again? “Thou shalt be ours, and heaven be thine, Thy victory without peril given; Sent a brief while on earth to shine, And then to shine a light in heaven. “And her that folds thee now so warm, And haply thinks 'twere death to part, Her shall a holier love inform, A clearer faith enlarge her heart.” Blest smile!—so let me live my day, That when my latest sun shall set, That smile reviving once may play, And gild my dying features yet: That smile to cheer the mourners round With hope of human sins forgiven; Token of earthly ties unbound, Of heart intent on opening heaven. 2. CHILDREN LIKE PARENTS. “Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.” When travail hours are spent and o'er, And genial hours of joy In cradle songs and nursery lore All the glad home employ, Full busy in her kindly mood Is Fancy, to descry The welcome notes of fatherhood, In form, and lip, and eye. And elder brethren's hearts are proud, And sisters blush and smile, As round the babe by turns they crowd A brief and wondering while. With eager speed they ready make Soft bosom and safe arm, As though such burthen once to take A blessing were and charm. And ever as with hastening wing His little life glides on, By power of that first wondrous spring To all but babes unknown, Easier each hour the task will grow, To name the unfolding flower, By plumage and by song to know The nestling in his bower.— Oh, while your hearts so blithely dance With frail fond hopes of earth, Will ye not cast one onward glance To the true heavenly birth? Will ye not say, “God speed the time When Spirits pure, to trace The hues of a more glorious prime, Shall lean from their high place, “And mark, too keen for earthly day, The Father's stamp and seal, Christ in the heart, the Living Ray, Its deepening light reveal?” Oh, well the denizens of Heaven Their Master's children know, By filial yearnings sweet and even, By patient smiles in woe, By gaze of meek inquiry, turn'd Towards th' informing Eye, By tears that to obey have learn'd, By clasped hands on high. Well may we guess, our Guardians true Stoop low and tarry long, Each accent noting, each faint hue, That shows us weak or strong. And even as loving nurses here Joy in the babe to find The likeness true of kinsman dear Or brother good and kind, So in each budding inward grace The Seraphs' searching ken The memory haply may retrace Of ancient, holy men. For of her Saints the Sacred Home Is never quite bereft; Each a bright shadow in the gloom, A glorious type, hath left: And by those features, stern or sweet, Of bold or gentle gleam, Heaven's keen-eyed Watchers haply mete What mortals holy deem. “And hark,” saith one, “the soul I guide— I heard it gently sigh In such a tone as Peter sighed, Touched by his Saviour's eye.” “And see,” another cries, “how soft Smiles on that little child Yon aged man! even so full oft The loved Disciple smiled. And oh, be sure no guardian fires Flash brighter in their joy Than theirs, who scan the meek desires And lowly lone employ Of maiden in her quiet bower, When haply glance or mien Reminds them of the lily flower With Blessed Mary seen.— But as when babes by look or tone Brother or friend recall, In all the Parents' right we own, Their memory blend with all, So in earth's saintly multitude Discern we Saints above:— In these, the Fountain Orb of Good, Pure Light and endless Love. 3. THE LULLABY. “Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept.” The western sky is glowing yet, The burnished Cross upon the spire Gives token where the Sun hath set, Touch'd faintly with its last dim fire. Pause on thy way from evening prayer, And listen: through the twilight air Floats from yon open cottage door A soft strain warbled o'er and o'er. A maiden rocks a babe to sleep, And times the cradle to her song;— A simple strain, not high nor deep, But awful thoughts thereto belong: For oft in holy Church's shade She to that strain hath lent her aid:— “In thee I put my steadfast trust, Defend me, Lord, for thou art just Psalm lxxi. 1. New Version..” Without a Psalm she breathes her strain, Lest haply ruder ears be nigh; But to the babe her sense is plain, In that half word of lullaby. That sound still varied, still the same, To him is as the Saving Name Pronounced in every tone, and strong To guard his sleep from every wrong. Angels may read such words of power, And infants feel them: we the while But dimly guess, till in His hour We see the Lord's unclouded smile. Then spells that guarded us of old Their hidden virtue shall unfold: Charm'd writings are they now; no eye May read them till the fire be nigh. O awful touch of God made Man! We have no lack if Thou art there, From Thee our infant joys began, By Thee our wearier age we bear. From Satan's breath, from Herod's sword, The cradle where Thou watchest, Lord, Is safe: the Avenger's rushing cry Is like a sister's lullaby. 4. SLEEPING ON THE WATERS. “And He was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake Him, and say unto Him, Master carest Thou not that we perish?” While snows, even from the mild South-west Come blinding o'er all day, What kindlier home, what safer nest, For flower or fragrant spray, Than underneath some cottage roof, Where fires are bright within, And fretting cares scowl far aloof, And doors are closed on sin? The scarlet tufts so cheerily Look out upon the snow, But gayer smiles the maiden's eye Whose guardian care they know. The buds that in that nook are born— Through the dark howling day Old Winter's spite they laugh to scorn:— What is so safe as they? Nay, look again, beside the hearth The lowly cradle mark, Where wearied with his ten hours' mirth, Sleeps in his own warm ark A bright-haired babe, with arm upraised, As though the slumberous dew Stole o'er him, while in Faith he gazed Upon his Guardian true. Storms may rush in, and crimes and woes Deform the quiet bower;— They may not mar the deep repose Of that immortal flower. Though only broken hearts be found To watch his cradle by, No blight is on his slumbers sound, No touch of harmful eye. So gently slumber'd on the wave The new-born seer of old, Ordained the chosen tribes to save; Nor dream'd how darkly roll'd The waters by his rushy brake, Perchance even now defiled With infants' blood for Israel's sake, Blood of some priestly child. What recks he of his mother's tears, His sister's boding sigh? The whispering reeds are all he hears, And Nile, soft weltering nigh, Sings him to sleep; but he will wake, And o'er the haughty flood Wave his stern rod;—and lo! a lake, A restless sea of blood! Soon shall a mightier flood thy call And outstretch'd rod obey; To right and left the watery wall From Israel shrinks away. Such honour wins the faith that gave Thee and thy sweetest boon Of infant charms to the rude wave, In the third joyous moon. Hail, chosen Type and Image true Of Jesus on the Sea! In slumber and in glory too, Shadowed of old by thee. Save that in calmness thou didst sleep The summer stream beside, He on a wider wilder deep, Where boding night-winds sigh'd:— Sigh'd when at eve He laid Him down, But with a sound like flame At midnight from the mountain's crown Upon His slumbers came.— Lo, how they watch, till He awake, Around His rude low bed: How wistful count the waves that break So near His sacred Head! O faithless! know ye not of old How in the western bay, When dark and vast the billows roll'd, A Prophet slumbering lay? The surges smote the keel as fast As thunderbolts from heaven:— Himself into the wave he cast, And hope and life were given. Behold, a mightier far is here;— Nor will He spare to leap, For the souls' sake He loves so dear, Into a wilder deep. E'en now He dreams of Calvary; Soon will He wake and say The words of peace and might: do ye His hour in calmness stay. 5. FIRST WAKING. “Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto Him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.” “Ye who wait in wistful gaze Where young infants lie, Learning faith and silent praise From each pure calm sigh, Say, 'mid all those beaming glances, Starts, and gleams, and silent trances, When the fond heart highest dances, Feeling Heaven so nigh?” “Hard it is, 'mid gifts so sweet Choosing out the prime: But no brighter smiles we meet Than at waking time, When they burst the chains of slumber, Chains that guard but not encumber, And glad fancies without number Ring their playful chime.” “Nay, but with a moaning sound Babes awakening start; See the uneasy eye glance round, Feel the beating heart.” “But the watcher's look prevailing In a moment stills that wailing, Eye and heart have ceased their ailing, Joy hath learn'd her part.”— So when rose on Easter dawn Our all-glorious Sun, You might see Love's eye withdrawn From th' adored One. Tears that morn were in her waking, Now again her heart is breaking;— Who may soothe her soul's sad aching? For her Lord is gone. Him for tears she may not see, Even her soul's delight, Yet full near to her is He.— Say, did Hosts of Light Ever breathe in mortals' hearing Tones so soft, so heavenly cheering? “Mary,” was the word endearing— Heaven and earth grew bright.— Lo, the babe spreads out his arms Toward the watcher's face, Fain to hide from sad alarms In Love's safe embrace.— See, the Word of Grace attending, Magdalen full lowly bending. “Touch Me not till Mine ascending,” Is the Word of Grace. Love with infant's haste would fain Touch Him and adore, But a deeper holier gain Mercy keeps in store. “Touch Me not: awhile believe Me: Touch Me not till Heaven receive Me, Then draw near and never leave Me, Then I go no more.” 6. LOOKING WESTWARD. “God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts.” Had I an infant, Lord, to rear And mould in Jesus' Law, How should I watch in hope and fear The first deep glance of awe, When for a bright and conscious gaze He lifts his eyelids meek, And round his own world's little maze Some marvel fain would seek! Bright be the spot, and pure the ray, That wins his steadfast eye; A path of light, a glorious way, To guide his soul on high. O, rich the tint of earthly gold, And keen the diamond's spark, But the young Lamb of Jesus' fold Should other splendours mark. To soothe him in the unquiet night I ask no taper's gleam, But bring him where the aërial light Falls from the Moon's soft beam. His heart at early morn to store With fancies fresh and rare, Count not thy jewels o'er and o'er, Show him no mirror's glare, But lift him where the Eastern heaven Glows with the Sun unseen, Where the strong wings, to morning given, Brood o'er a world serene. There let him breathe his matin thought Of pure unconscious love, There taste the dew by Angels brought In silence from above. Yet, might I choose a time, me seems That earliest wistful gaze Were best to meet the softening beams Of sunset's glowing maze. Wide be the western casement thrown At sultry evening's fall, The gorgeous lines be duly shown That weave Heaven's wondrous pall. Calm be his sleep, whose eyelids close Upon so fair a sight: Not gentler mother's music flows, Her sweetest, best good night. So hastes the Lord our hearts to fill With calm baptismal grace, Preventing all false gleams of ill By His own glorious Face. 7. UPWARD GAZING. “And whence is this to me, that the Mother of my Lord should come to me? For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.” “Whence is the mighty grace, Mother of God, that thou to me shouldst come Me, who but fill a sinner's place, A sinful child hid in my womb? Who in God's sight am I, And who mine unborn boy, That I should view Heaven's Spouse so nigh, He in my bosom leap for joy?” O cry of deep delight By Aaron's sainted daughter breath'd that hour! O joy preventing life and light, When the Incarnate in his Power Came to th' Unborn! even now Your echo faint we feel, When o'er the newly sealed brow Glad airs and gleams of summer steal. Oft as in sunbright dawn The infant lifts his eye, joying to find The dusky veil of sleep undrawn, And to the East gives welcome kind: Or in the morning air Waves high his little arm, As though he read engraven there His fontal name, Christ's saving charm: Oft as in hope untold The parent's eye pursues that eager look, Enkindling like the shafts of old, Where mid the stars their way they took Virg. Æn. v. 525.: Still in Love's steady gaze, In Joy's unbidden cry, That holy mother's glad amaze, That infant's worship, we descry. Still Mary's Child unseen Comes breathing, in the heart just seal'd His own, Prayers of high hope: what bliss they mean, And where they soar, to Him is known!— But, joyous Mothers, mark, And mark, exulting Sires, All who the pure baptismal spark Would duteous nurse to saintly fires: Stern is the Babe, and lone: Vow'd from his birth, unborn he seals the vow, And ere he win his glory-throne, Vigil and fast his frame must bow, And hours of prayer, apart From Home's too soothing praise; His Saviour's image in his heart Increasing while his own decays. 8. CHILDREN'S THANKFULNESS. “A joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.” Why so stately, Maiden fair, Rising in thy nurse's arms With that condescending air; Gathering up thy queenly charms, Like some gorgeous Indian bird, Which, when at eve the balmy copse is stirr'd, Turns the glowing neck, to chide Th' irreverent foot-fall, then makes haste to hide Again its lustre deep Under the purple wing, best home of downy sleep? Not as yet she comprehends How the tongues of men reprove, But a spirit o'er her bends Train'd in Heaven to courteous love, And with wondering grave rebuke Tempers, to-day, shy tone and bashful look.— Graceless one, 'tis all of thee, Who for her maiden bounty, full and free, The violet from her gay And guileless bosom, didst no word of thanks repay. Therefore, lo, she opens wide Both her blue and wistful eyes,— Breathes her grateful chant, to chide Our too tardy sympathies. Little Babes and Angels bright— They muse, be sure, and wonder, day and night, How th' all-holy Hand should give, The sinner's hand in thanklessness receive. We see it and we hear, But wonder not: for why? we feel it all too near. Not in vain, when feasts are spread, To the youngest at the board See Hooker, E. P. v. 31. 2. Call we to incline the head, And pronounce the solemn word. Not in vain they clasp and raise The soft pure fingers in unconscious praise, Taught perchance by pictur'd wall How little ones before the Lord may fall, How to His lov'd caress Reach out the restless arm, and near and nearer press. Children in their joyous ranks, As you pace the village street, Fill the air with smiles and thanks If but once one babe you greet. Never weary, never dim, From Thrones Seraphic mounts th' eternal hymn. Babes and Angels grudge no praise:— But elder souls, to whom His saving ways Are open, fearless take Their portion, hear the Grace, and no meek answer make. Save our blessings, Master, save From the blight of thankless eye: Teach us for all joys to crave Benediction pure and high, Own them given, endure them gone, Shrink from their hardening touch, yet prize them won: Prize them as rich odours, meet For Love to lavish on His Sacred Feet;— Prize them as sparkles bright Of heavenly dew, from yon o'erflowing well of light. 9. CHILDREN WITH DUMB CREATURES. “The sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.” Thou mak'st me jealous, Infant dear; Why wilt thou waste thy precious smiles, Thy beckonings blithe, and joyous wiles, On bird or insect gliding near? Why court the deaf and blind? What is this wondrous sympathy, That draws thee so, heart, ear, and eye, Towards the inferior kind? We tempt thee much to look and sing,— Thy mimic notes are rather drawn From feathered playmates on the lawn. The quivering moth or bee's soft wing Brushing the window pane, Will reach thee in thy dreamy trance, When nurses' skill for one bright glance Hath toil'd an hour in vain. And as thou hold'st the creatures dear, So are they fain on thee to wait. Blood-hounds at thy caress abate Their bayings wild; yea, without fear Thou dalliest in the lair Of watch-dog stern; thy mother's eye Shrinks not to see thee slumbering lie Beneath his duteous care. The war-horse treads full soft, they say, If in his path a babe he see. The tiger's whelp, encaged with thee, Would sheathe his claws, to sport and play. Bees have for thee no sting:— They love thy trusting heart too well, That mightier guard than fairy spell Of old, or magic ring. Oh, who the secret powers hath traced, That in such league mysterious bind The gentlest with the fiercest kind, The sheepfold with the howling waste? Is it, that each and all The living sympathize with life?— That sudden movements, though in strife, The entranced thought recall? He whom the burning East hath bred, Wizard or sage, in day-dreams wild, Might say, “Dim memories haunt the child, Of lives in other beings led, Other, and yet the same. Nor less an instinct true, though blind, Dwells in the soul of meaner kind, Spark of past hope or shame.” Nay, call it recollection deep Of Eden bowers,—high purity Beaming around from brow or eye Of infants, waking or asleep:— As in old time, we read, The royal lion bending low Did Una's virgin-glory know, Her guardian prove in need. Of homage paid in Paradise To Adam, guileless then and pure, The broken dream may yet endure Within them—visions vague arise Of a Superior Power, Discern'd by form erect, and mien Commanding, and calm purpose, seen In eyes that smile or lower. Thus tender babes and beasts of prey May silently each other mind Of the old League: “Let man be kind And true, so all must him obey.” Thus giants of the wood, Wild elephant or mountain bull, Beneath some quiet stripling's rule Stand quailing and subdued. Who knows but here, in mercy lent, A gleam preventing heaven we see, A token of Love's victory In a sweet awful Sacrament? Hearts fallen and sin-born, Oh, why are ye so fondly stirr'd? For bounding lamb or lonely bird Why should ye joy or mourn? Ah, you have been in Jesus' arms, The holy Fount hath you imbued With His all-healing kindly Blood, And somewhat of His pastoral charms, And care for His lost sheep, Ye there have learn'd: in order'd tones Gently to soothe the lesser ones, And watch their noon-day sleep. Lo, far and wide the Love o'erflows, The Love that to your souls He gave In the regenerating wave;— Both man and beast His mercy knows;— Nor from His pattern swerve His children, tending lamb or dove:— But aye the choice of all your love Ye for His Least reserve. To point the way where they should go, By word and gesture, o'er and o'er, Teach them untir'd all courteous lore, Hear their first prayers, so meek and low:— These are your arts: by these Ye in the fold your task fulfil, And the Good Shepherd on the hill From far approving sees. 10. LIFTING UP TO THE CROSS. “But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.” Oft have I read of sunny realms, where skies are pure at even, And sight goes deep in lucid air, and earth seems nearer Heaven, And wheresoe'er you lift your eyes, the holy Cross, they say, Stands guardian of your journey, by lone or crowded way; And I have mused how awfully its shadows and its gleams Might haply fall on infants' eyes, and mingle with their dreams, And draw them up by silent power of its o'er-shading arm, And deepen on the tender brow Christ's seal and saintly charm. Oft have I read, and dream'd, and now behold a token true! A maiden from a distant isle, where Faith is fresh of hue,— Where memory tarries, to reprove our cold irreverent age, In churches set like stars around some saintly hermitage; Where old Devotion lingers beside the granite Cross, And pilgrims seek the healing well, far over moor and moss,— A noble-hearted maiden, from a believing shore, Is by, to see Christ's little ones Him Crucified adore. Upon a verdant hillock the sacred sign appears, A damsel on no trembling arm an eager babe uprears, With a sister's yearning love, and an elder sister's pride, She lifts the new-baptized, to greet the Friend Who for him died A traveller from Ireland witnessed this scene on the Continent, and described it to the Author.. Who may the maiden's thought divine, performing thus in sight Of all the heavenly Watchers her pure unbidden rite? While fearless to those awful Lips her treasure she would raise, I see her features shrink, as though she fain would downward gaze. Perchance a breath of self-reproach is fluttering round her heart:— “Thou, darling, in our Saviour mayst for certain claim thy part: The dews baptismal bright and keen are glistening on thy brow, He cannot choose but own thee, in His arms received e'en now. But much I've sinn'd and little wept: will He not say, ‘Begone?’ I dare not meet His searching eye; my penance is undone. But thou and thy good Angel, who nerves mine arm to bear And lift thee up so near Him, will strive for me in prayer.” Or chanced the Thorny Crown her first upseeking glance to win, And the deep lines of agony traced by the whole world's sin? Oh, deeply in her bosom went the thought, “Who draw so nigh Unto those awful Lips, and share the Lord's departing sigh,— Who knoweth what mysterious pledge upon their souls is bound, To copy in their own hearts' blood each keen and bitter Wound? If of the dying Jesus we the Kiss of Peace receive, How but in daily dying thenceforward dare we live? “And was it meet, thou tender flower, on thy young life to lay Such burden, pledging thee to vows thou never canst unsay? What if the martyrs' fire some day thy dainty limbs devour? What if beneath the scourge they writhe, or in dull famine cower? What if thou bear the cross within, all aching and decay?— And 'twas I that laid it on thee:—what if thou fall away?” Such is Love's deep misgiving, when stronger far than Faith, She brings her earthly darlings to the Cross for life or death. O, be Thou present in that hour, high Comforter, to lead Her memory to th' eternal Law, by the great King decreed, What time the highly favoured one who on His bosom lay, And he who of the chosen twelve first trode the martyrs' way, Taught by their mother, crav'd the boon next to Thy throne to be, For her dreams were of the Glory, but the Cross she could not see. O well for that fond mother, well for her belov'd, that they, When th' hour His secret meaning told, did by their promise stay. “Thy baptism and Thy cup be ours: for both our hearts are strong.” Learn it, ye babes, at matin prime, repeat it all day long. Even as the mother's morning kiss is token of delight Through all the merry hours of day, and at fall of dewy night Her evening kiss shall to her babe the softest slumbers seal, So Thy first greeting life imparts, Thy last shall cheer and heal.— Then, maiden, trust thy nursling here; thou wilt not choose amiss For his sweet soul; here let him dwell; here is the gate of bliss. Three Saints of old their lips upon the Incarnate Saviour laid, And each with death or agony for the high rapture paid. His Mother's holy kisses of the coming sword gave sign, And Simeon's hymn full closely did with his last breath entwine; And Magdalen's first tearful touch prepared her but to greet With homage of a broken heart his pierced and lifeless feet.— Then courage, duteous maiden; the nails and bleeding brows, The pale and dying lips, are the portion of the Spouse. 11. SICKNESS IN THE CRADLE. “They brought young children to Christ, that He should touch them.” “A Christian child in pain! O sad amazing thought! A babe elect and born again, With blood of Jesus bought, That never yet knew dream of sin, Nor throb of pride, nor will unclean; Yet faint with fever see him lie, Or in strong grasp of sinners' agony!” O, mother fond and wild, Stay the complaining word! What wouldst thou have? Thy suffering child Is as his Saviour Lord. Or ever eight brief days have flown, He, the unstain'd, must make His moan, Must taste the sacrificial knife, Must to the Cross devote the tender life. Behold, the Virgin blest Calls on her Babe to wake From His sweet slumber on her breast; How should her heart not ache? From her pure bosom, where all night He softly slept, that Maiden bright Resigns her Well-beloved at morn To shed His blood; for therefore was He born. Pierc'd is her heart, yet still: For why? that Mother's love Is one with His Almighty will, Chang'd by the o'ershadowing Dove. O freely then your treasures yield, With the dread Cross so lately seal'd, Yield to the chastenings of th' Unseen, The Saviour's Presence-tokens, sweet as keen. 12. ANTICIPATION AND RETROSPECTION. “And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.” A fragment of a rainbow bright Through the moist air I see, All dark and damp on yonder height, All clear and gay to me. An hour ago the storm was here, The gleam was far behind. So will our joys and griefs appear When earth has ceased to blind. Grief will be joy, if on its edge Fall soft that holiest ray: Joy will be grief, if no faint pledge Be there of heavenly day. Christ's Passion eve fell dark and drear Upon His faithful few, But brighter each returning year, In memory gleam'd anew. And loud the chant of hope and glee O'er Adam's eldest born, But, hapless mother, who like thee Her travail pangs might mourn? 13. JUDAS'S INFANCY. “The Son of man goeth as it is written of Him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.” Alas! that e'er the pangs of birth, The consecrated throes, whereby Eden revives, should breed on earth Untemper'd agony! Yet sure as frail repenting Eve For pardon knelt of yore, and now Adoring kneels, there to receive, Where all the world shall bow, From fruit of her own favour'd womb, The peace, the home, her wandering lost:— Sure as to blessed Mary come The Saints' and Martyrs' host, To own, with many a thankful strain, The channel of undying bliss, The bosom where the Lord hath lain, The hand that held by His; Sure as her form for evermore The glory and the joy shall wear, That rob'd her, bending to adore The Babe her chaste womb bare;— So surely throes unblest have been. And cradles where no kindly star Look'd down—no Angel's eye serene, To gleam through years afar. Did not our Lord speak out His ban, The Christ for His betrayer mourn? “Alas! good were it for that man If he had ne'er been born.” Nor may we doubt, his Mother mild Upon that bosom pitying thought, Where Judas lay, a harmless Child, By gold as yet unbought. But Time, as holy sages sing, When earth and sin have waxed old, A direr progeny will bring, The last foe of the fold. Of mortal seed, of woman bred, The Antichrist, they write, will be, From a soft bosom duly fed, Rock'd on a loving knee. High grace at first to Judas came— Who knows but he, the Man of Sin, In the baptismal wave and flame May his dread course begin? O ye who wait with hearts too light By Font or cradle, fear in time! O let not all your dreams be bright, Here in Earth's wayward clime! From the foul dew, the blighting air, Watch well your treasure newly won. Heaven's child and yours, uncharm'd by prayer, May prove Perdition's son. 14. THE SAINTS' INFANCY. “And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an Angel.” Where is the brow to bear in mortals' sight The Crown of pure angelic Light? And where the favoured eye Through the dim air the radiance to descry? An infant on its mother smiling, Wash'd from the world and sin's defiling, And to Faith's arm restored, while yet With the blest dew its cheeks are wet:— There Christ hath sworn seraphic Light shall be, There eyes, the Light to see. He who vouchsafed to kindle that pure glow Will feed it day and night, we know, By duteous fear of sin Fann'd into flame the virgin heart within, Till once again at Angels' warning Heaven-gates shall part as clouds of morning, And the confirming Spirit pour His glory where young hearts adore: There is Heaven's Light; there, if true Pastors be, Are eyes, the Light to see. And what if there some favoured one should kneel, Whom in His time the Lord will seal, High in the Mount to draw Light uncorrupt from His pure fontal Law, Then 'mid his brethren bear unknowing The lustre keen within him glowing, But veil it, when he feels their gaze, As Moses veil'd the Sinai rays?— Blest, who so shines: and blest the thoughtful few, Who see that brightness true. Wouldst thou the tide of grace should higher flow, The angelic ray more glorious show? Wait for His trial hour, His willing Saints in His dread day of Power. Ever as earth's wild war-cries heighten, The Cross upon the brow will brighten, Till on the very scorner's gaze Break forth the Heaven-reflecting rays, Strange awful charms the unwilling eye compel On the Saints' Light to dwell. Yes—strive, thou world, in thy rash tyrant-mood, To slake that burning Cross in blood:— It will but brighter burn, As martyrs' eyes near and more near discern Where on the Father's right hand beaming, Light upon Light in glory streaming, The Saviour, felt, not seen, in life, Deigns to be seen in that last strife, And Angels hail, approaching to the shore, Rays like their own, and more. Who knows but maiden mild or smiling boy, Our own entrusted care and joy, By His electing grace May with His martyrs find their glorious place? O hope, for prayer too bold and thrilling, O bliss, to aid its high fulfilling! O woe and wrong, O tenfold shame, To mar or damp the angelic flame! To draw His soldiers backward from the Cross! Woe and eternal loss! 15. THE CRADLE GUARDED. “Whose fan is in His hand, and He will throughly purge His floor, and gather His wheat into the garner; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.” “As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.” The Lord, th' All-gracious, hides not all His Ire: Through the dim chinks of this decaying earth Gleams ever and anon th' unwasted fire, Startling rude eyes, and shaming lawless mirth. Even in the joy of Harvest, see, His Brand Over the chaff is kindling; sheaves for food And tares for fire, He binds in equal band. At vintage time His robes are rolled in blood. His Angels and His Saints cry out, How long? His Little ones, full keenly are they bent To right the fallen and redress the wrong, Full eagerly to justice run unsent. These are Thy tokens, all-redeeming Lord! Where, but of Thee, learn'd we aright to name The last dire prison? Thine the dismal word, Thine the undying worm, th' unquenched flame. Therefore Thy duteous Spouse, our mother dear, Tuning her love-notes to the Father's voice, Is fain to breathe grave warnings in deep fear, And say to Sin, Hell is thine hopeless choice! The strain Love taught her, she in Love repeats. Call it not hard, if in each holiest hour, When with unwonted joy her King she greets, With His own threatenings she would fence His bower. Call it not stern, though to her babes she show The smoke aye glaring o'er th' abode of ill; Though guileless hearts, even in their vernal glow, Hear now and then her thunders, and are still. Might the calm smile, that on the infant's brow So brightly beams, all its deep meaning tell, Would it not say, “For Love's sweet sake allow Fear's chastening Angel here with me to dwell? Was not the purchase of my quiet bliss A life-long anguish and a Cross of woe? O! much I fear the mountain-path to miss, If from my sight I lose the gulf below.” Such lesson learn we by the cradle's side, Nor other teach dark hills and valleys deep: Where rude rocks fiercest frown, and waters chide, 'Tis but to guard the green mead's lowly sleep.— There is a peak—the raven loves it well, And all the mists of neighbouring ocean love,— Which if you climb, what seem'd a pinnacle Proves as a wide sea-beach where cormorants rove. Rocks showered at random, as by giant hands, Strew the rude terrace: heedful be his eye, And firm his step, who on the dark edge stands Beneath the cloud, and downward dares espy. “What seest thou there?” A thousand feet below, And further on, far as the mists that sweep Around me suffer, dimly trac'd in snow, Pale forms I see, reclining on the steep. Each in his drear ravine, where never ray Even from the cold north-east in June might fall, They sleep in silence till th' appointed Day, Nor heed the eagle's scream, the whirlwind's call. The wastes of vapour, veering round, now hide And now reveal the watchers dark and vast, Which by each awful resting-place abide,— Grim towering crags:—who there his eye shall cast, With aught of sin's sad burthen on his soul, Feels he not like a powerless child forlorn, Over a gulf where flaming billows roll By a strong outstretch'd Arm as yet upborne? O surely then to his heart's deep is brought The prayer, the vow, there evermore to cling, And sickening turn from the wild haunting thought, “What if at once o'er the dread verge I spring?” Retiring, sure he to a warning Voice Will time his footsteps, on a true Arm lean: What happy vale soe'er may crown his choice, That awful gulf, those rocks will be its screen. Lo, nestling at the mountain's further base, And guarded by its terrors, a soft glen: Its waters run a golden gladsome race, Its windings hide meet homes for pastoral men. Lord, if in such calm bowers a rest Thou give, We pray Thee, crown Thy gift with Fear, that we May in the shadow of Thy judgments live, The wrath o'ertake us on our bended knee. III. Early Encouragements. 1. TRUSTWORTHINESS. The child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem.” The cares, the loves of parents fond Go deep, all loves, all cares beyond. Fain would they read the good and ill That nestles in our silent will, And night and day They wish and pray That only good may there find way. But deeper lurk all breasts within The secrets both of grace and sin. Each has his world of thought alone, To one dread Watcher only known. And far and wide On every side Our dreams dart on—no earthly guide. Glad may they be and calm of heart, Who, when their child so walks apart, Seek him and find where Angels come On Jesus' work, in Jesus' Home:— Who, out of sight, Know all is right, One law for darkness and for light. If in pure aims and deeds and prayers His path mount high, and far from theirs, If seeking him 'mid friends below They find him not, what joy to know He hath but turn'd Where Jesus yearn'd To be;—where heavenly Love is learn'd! Thou who didst teach thy Mother dear, In three dim days of doubt and fear, By timely training to foreknow Thy Passion and its three days' woe, Prepare Thou still Our heart and will,— Our friends' and ours,—for good and ill. 2. SAMUEL'S PRAYER. “Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast Thou ordained strength.” With joy the guardian Angel sees A duteous child upon his knees, And writes in his approving book Each upward, earnest, holy look. Light from his pure aërial dream He springs to meet morn's orient beam, And pours towards the kindling skies His clear adoring melodies. Some glorious Seraph, waiting by, Receives the prayer to waft on high, And wonders, as he soars, to read More than we know, and all we need. More than we know, and all we need, Is in young children's prayer and creed. They, for their Home, before Him fall, He, for His Church, receives their call. They cry with simple voice and clear, “Bless Father, Mother, Brethren dear:” He for the Priests of His dread Son Accounts the blessing ask'd and won. For holy Priests and Matrons mild, For penitents and undefiled, For dying Saints, for babes new-born, He takes their offering, eve and morn. He gives the frail and feeble tongue A doom to speak on sin and wrong; Unconscious they stern lightnings aim, When His ten Precepts they proclaim. Thus in the Tabernacle shade At morn and eve young Samuel pray'd, Nor knew his prayer God's ark would win, Forfeit by priest's and people's sin. To Eli thus dread words he spake:— Ye hearts profane, with penance ache;— A wondrous peal o'er Israel rung, Heaven's thunder from a child's meek tongue. 3. PRAYER AT HOME AND IN CHURCH. “These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the Mother of Jesus. and with His brethren.” Where are the homes of Paschal Mirth, The bowers where heavenly Joy may rest her wings on earth, And at her leisure gaze adoring Where out of sight the golden clouds are soaring Beneath the ascending Saviour's Feet? Where may rejoicing Love retreat To frame a melody for His returning meet? Two homes we know of Love's resort, One in the upper room, one in the Temple court; In glorious Sion both, possessing Alike her presence, whom the awful blessing Lifted above all Adam's race:— The royal Twelve are there in place; Women and duteous friends, awaiting His high grace. Two homes for us His Love hath found, One by our quiet couch and one on holy ground. There in due season meekly kneeling Learn we our lesson ere His last revealing. The Mother of our Lord is there, And Saints are breathing hallow'd air, Living and dead, to waft on high our feeble prayer. And with His Mother and His Saints He watches by, who loves the prayer that never faints. Avaunt, ill thoughts and thoughts of folly! Where christen'd infants sport, that floor is holy: Holier the station where they bow, Adoring Him with daily vow, Till He with ampler grace their youthful hearts endow. 4. SELF-EXAMINATION. “And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.” “What wouldst Thou have me do, O Lord?” Darkling he spoke and lowly laid, With all his heart he spake the word, The awful Voice mild answer made: “Go, seek one out who thee may bring Where healing, holy waters spring, Then will I show thee speedily What burthen thou must bear for Me.” “What wouldst Thou have me do, O Lord?” Each morn and eve we seem to say, And He gives back no doubtful word: “Remember, little child, all day, Thine early vows, the hallow'd wave Where Jesus first His blessing gave: There stoop, there cleanse thee every hour: Christ's Laver hath refreshing power.” “What wouldst Thou have me do, O Lord?” Rise, little child, and onward go, Where Saints are met with one accord The praises of high God to show. In meekness learn their prayer and song, Do as they do, and thou ere long Shalt see the wonders they behold In heavenly books and creeds of old. “What wouldst Thou have me do, O Lord?” So whispering, Saul with prostrate brow The persecuted One adored, So breathed his earliest Christian vow Stern the reply:—to fast alone, And in the darkness make his moan. Thrice set and rose the weary day, Ere with the Christians he might pray. “What wouldst Thou have me do, O Lord?” Think, little child; thy conscience try, Rebellious deed and idle word, And selfish thought and envious eye:— Hast thou no mark of these? and yet Full in thy sight His Law was set. O, if He joy'd the Cross to bear, With patience take thy little share. 5. CONFESSION. “And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.” Didst thou not hear how soft the day-wind sighed, How from afar that sweeping breath it drew, Waved the light rustling branches far and wide Then died away, then rose and moaned anew? Sure if aright our morning prayers were said, We in those tones the Almighty's unseen walk Shall hear, nor vainly shun the Presence dread, Which comes in mercy with our souls to talk “Where art thou, child of earth?” He seems to say, “Why hide so deep from Love's all-seeing eye?”— “I heard and feared, for I have sinned to-day.”— “What? know'st thou not the Almighty One was by? “Think'st thou to lurk in yonder wavering boughs, Where even these earthly sunbeams glide and steal? Nay, speed thee forth while yet high grace allows Lay bare thy wounds to Him who waits to heal. “They only rankle in th' unwholesome shade; But sun and air have soothing power, and He Yearns to forgive, when hearts are lowly laid. Even now behold His robe prepared for thee. “These fluttering leaves the more unveil thy shame. Fall humbly down, and hide thine eyes in dust: He will upraise thee, for His own great Name; His penance garb will make and show thee just.” 6. TELL THY MOTHER. “Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.” Weary soul and burthened sore, Labouring with thy secret load, Fear not all thy grief to pour In this heart, true Love's abode. Think not all is hidden quite: Mothers' ears are keen to hear, Mothers' eyes are quick as light, Glancing wide and watching near. I with boding anguish read Half your tale ere ye begin: Bitter drops in heart I bleed, Penance for your shame and sin. Grudge not thou thine eyes to hide On this breast that aches for thee: Patient, kneeling, here abide Till th' absolving Voice is free. I from thy baptismal hour Yearn for thee, hard heart and dry: Seek my penitential bower, In the dust beside me lie. 7. ABSOLUTION. “Whose sins ye forgive, they are forgiven.” Live ever in my heart, sweet awful hour, When prostrate in my sin and shame I lay, And heard the absolving accents fall with power, As soft, as keen, as lambent lightnings play. And sure with lightning glance they seem'd to thrill, (O may the dream prove true!) and search and burn Each foul dark corner of my lawless will. What if the Spirit griev'd did then return?— O fear, O joy to think!—and what if yet, In some far moment of eternity, The lore of evil I may quite forget, And with the pure in heart my portion be? Live in my heart, dread blissful hope, to tame The haughty brow, to curb the unchastened eye, And shape to deeds of good each wavering aim; O teach me some true penance ere I die! 8. HOURS OF PRAYER. “Evening, and morning, and at noon-day will I pray.” Down, slothful heart! how darest thou say, “Call not so oft to pray?” Behold, the Lord's own bounteous showers Keep their appointed hours. The forenoon saw the Spirit first On orphan'd Saints in glory burst; At noontide hour Saint Peter saw The sheet let down, heavenward all earth to draw; At eventide, when good Cornelius kneel'd Upon his fasting day, an Angel shone revealed. Untired is He in mercy's task, Then tire not thou to ask. He says not, “Yesterday I gave, Wilt thou for ever crave?” He every moment waits to give, Watch thou unwearied to receive. Thine Hours of Prayer, upon the Cross To Him were hours of woe and shame and loss; Scourging at morn; at noon, pierced hands and feet; At eve, fierce pains of death, for thee He counted sweet. The blue sky o'er the green earth bends, All night the dew descends: The green earth to the blue heaven's ray Its bosom spreads all day. Earth answers heaven: the holy race Should answer His unfailing grace. Then smile, low world, in spite or scorn, We to our God will kneel ere prime of morn; The third, the sixth, the ninth—each Passion hour,— We with high praise will keep, as He with gifts of power. 9. REPEATING THE CREED. “Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.” Many the banners bright and fair, Uplifted in the gleaming sky, When Faith would show this lower air The token of her victory. The heaven-enlightened eye and mind, By meek confession purified, Gazes on high, nor fails to find Which way the signs celestial guide. One bodies forth a Virgin Form, Holding aloft a Cross of might, And watching, how through cloud and storm Its head is lost in deepening light. Another dreams, by night and day, Of a calm Prophet's face, intent To hear what God the Lord shall say, Ere the dread tones be gone and spent. An Eagle from the deep of space Is hovering near, and hastes to bring (Meetest the unearthly tale to trace,) A plume of his mysterious wing. A golden Chalice standing by,— What mantles there is life or death; A Dragon to the unpurged eye, A Serpent from the Cross, to Faith. O visions dread and bright, I feel You are too high for me, I seek A lowlier impress for my seal, More of this earth, though pure and meek. Give me a tender spotless child, Rehearsing or at eve or morn His chant of glory undefiled, The Creed that with the Church was born. Down be his earnest forehead cast, His slender fingers joined for prayer, With half a frown his eye sealed fast Against the world's intruding glare. Who, while his lips so gently move, And all his look is purpose strong, Can say what wonders, wrought above, Upon his unstained fancy throng? The world new-framed, the Christ new-born, The Mother-Maid, the cross and grave, The rising sun on Easter morn, The fiery tongues sent down to save,— The gathering Church, the Font of Life, The saints and mourners kneeling round, The Day to end the body's strife, The Saviour in His people crowned,— All in majestic march and even To the veil'd eye by turns appear, True to their time as stars in heaven, No morning dream so still and clear. And this is Faith, and thus she wins Her victory, day by day rehearsed. Seal but thine eye to pleasant sins, Love's glorious world will on thee burst. 10. LESSONS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS. (For St. Luke's Day.) There is nothing hid from the heat thereof.” Mother of Christ's children dear, Teacher true of loving Fear, Kind Physician, wakeful Nurse, Wont with many a potent verse By our cradles watch to keep, Singing new-born Saints to sleep; Be thy tenderest breath to-day Breathed on all we sing or say. For to-day that Saint we own, Who to Jesus' cradle-throne Led us first, with shepherds mild, With that Mother undefiled, There to adore the wondrous Child. Spouse of Christ, so pure and bright, Skill'd, by His unearthly light, In our coarse dim air to trace Lines and hues from yon high place, Gathering tones from earth and sky For His perfect harmony:— As to-day thou guid'st our thought Where that holy Painter wrought, Who with pen and pencil true Christ's own awful Mother drew; Be thy prayer untired and strong, That when eager fancies throng, Pure may be our dream and song. Watcher of the eternal ways, Trusted with the Saints' high praise, Oft as o'er our childish trance History bids her visions glance,— Wonders wild in airy measures, Records grave from Memory's treasures,— Guide thou well the heart-winning line, May our love and hate be thine. He whose tongue of Jesus told On His Cross and in His Fold, Third of the mysterious Four,— Learn we all His sacred lore, Listening at the Kingdom's door. 11. UNWEARIED LOVE. “Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.” My child, the counsels high attend Of thine Eternal Friend. When longings pure, when holy prayers, When self-denying thoughts and cares Room in thine heart would win, Stay not too long to count them o'er; Rise in His Name; throw wide the door, Let the good Angels in: Nor listen, should the Tempter say, “How wearying, day by day, To say the prayer we said before, The mountain path climb o'er and o'er, No end to warfare find!” Nor seek thou, limit to discern In patient woe, in duty stern, But learn thy Mother's mind. She will not tire on thee to wait In early hour or late: To-morrow even as yesterday, Still onward, onward in Love's way To speed, her only dream. So many love-deeds done, to cease Her kindly toil, and rest in peace, Small joy to her would seem. And He, the Fountain of her Love,— His treasure-house above Is open, day and night, with store Of healing for our daily sore, With grace to mourners given, O'er-powering, by the tide of tears, All that from old abhorred years Remains of wasting leaven. He pardoning wearies not. Ah, why Behold with evil eye Thy brother asking grace for sin? He doth but aid thee, more to win Of hope in thy last end. In heart forgive—that pays Him all: But grudging souls must die in thrall, No Saviour and no Friend. IV. Early Warnings. 1. EFFECT OF EXAMPLE. “For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.” Five loving souls, each one as mine, And each for evermore to be! Each deed of each to thrill For good or ill Along thine awful line, Eternity! Who for such burthen may suffice? Who bear to think, how scornful tone, Or word or glance too bold, Or ill dream told, May bar from Paradise Our Master's own? We scatter seeds with careless hand, And dream we ne'er shall see them more: But for a thousand years Their fruit appears, In weeds that mar the land, Or healthful store. The deeds we do, the words we say,— Into still air they seem to fleet, We count them ever past; But they shall last, In the dread judgment they And we shall meet! I charge thee by the years gone by, For the love's sake of brethren dear, Keep thou the one true way In work and play, Lest in that world their cry Of woe thou hear! 2. PRESUMPTION. “Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this thing?” Dear Child, to thee the tale is told Of him who robb'd the poor man's fold. Thou listenest, and with scorn and ire Thy quivering brow is all on fire. Thou think'st, O never sure on me So foul a blot shall Angels see. For joy thou hold'st thine eager breath To hear him doom'd;—he dies the death. But mark, young David was as thou, A generous boy with open brow. With heart as pure as mountain air He caroll'd to his fleecy care: With motion free as mountain cloud He trode where mists the moorland shroud, From bear and lion tore the prey, Nor deem'd he e'er should rend as they. Such was his dawn: but O! how grieve Good Angels o'er his noon and eve! He that with oil of joy began In sackcloth ends, a fallen man. Then wherefore trust youth's eager thought? Wait till thine arm all day hath wrought: Wait humbly till thy matin psalm Due cadence find in evening calm. 3. DANGER OF PRAISE. “And he confessed; and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.” When mortals praise thee, hide thine eyes, Nor in thy Master's wrong Take to thyself His crown and prize; Yet more in heart than tongue. None holier than the Desert Priest Beneath the Law's dim sky, Yet in Heaven's kingdom with the least, We read, he might not vie. No member, yet, of Christ the Son, No gospel Prophet he; Only a voice from out the Throne Of dread yet blest decree. If he confessed, nor dared deny, Woe to that Christian's heart, Who in man's praise would walk on high, And steal his Saviour's part! And ah! to him what tenfold woe, Who hides so well his sin, Through earth he seems a saint to go, Yet dies impure within. Pray we our Lord, one pang to send Of deep remorseful fear For every smile of partial friend.— Praise be our Penance here! 4. ENVY. “If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.” What is this cloud upon thy brow? “The Lord accepts my brother's vow, But turns no ear to mine. High in the liquid heaven behold His altar-flames in many an airy fold, But where I kneel, the Almighty makes no sign.” Yes: welcome to the pure bright air, And dear to Angels, is his prayer, For the sweet fragrance' sake Of loving deeds: bring thou the same, Thine altar too shall feel the gracious flame: Haste, ere the monster at thy door awake. Beside thine hearth, thine home within, Lies couched and still a deadly sin, O chain it while 'tis time. Learn on thy brother's joy to gaze With thankful eye; and heaven's high counsel praise, That crowned him with the forfeit of thy crime. Thy forehead yet awhile must bear His wrathful mark; but alms and prayer, And penance true and stern, May wear it out: thine evil eye May melt in dews of holy charity, Thy sullen tones to meek confessions turn. 5. MISTRUST OF ELDERS. Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen Me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.” When holy books, when loving friends, When parents grave and kind Tell of the peace the Almighty sends On the pure heart and mind,— When they, on whom our souls should lean, The wondrous joy declare, How to God's Altar they have been And found their Saviour there,— Alas! too often, worldly wise, We scorn what they reveal, We will not see with others' eyes, Ourselves would touch and feel. Thus many a precious day, month, year, The blessing we delay: It comes at last with saddened cheer, He justly dims His ray. Seven days, we read, a Saint of old Dreamed on in doubt alone: Seven days of hope and joy untold For evermore were gone. And when at last the all-gracious Lord Vouchsafed the awful sign, Made answer to his secret word And showed the Wounds divine, Even with that light of love there came A soft yet warning cloud, A shade of pity more than blame:— “Behold thy prayer allowed. “My glorious Wounds I show to thee, Even here in earth's dull light; But happier they, who wait to see, Till heaven has purged their sight.” Alas, that man his breath should lose In wayward, doubting race, Nor his still home in shelter choose Where Thou hast set his place! 6. FINE CLOTHES. (For Palm Sunday.) “And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way.” Look westward, pensive little one, How the bright hues together run, Around where late the waning sun Sank in his evening cloud. Or eastward turn thee, and admire How linger yet the showers of fire, Deep in each fold, high on each spire Of yonder mountain proud. Thou seest it not: an envious screen, A fluttering leaflet, hangs between Thee and that fair mysterious scene, A veil too near thine eye. One finger's breadth at hand will mar A world of light in Heaven afar, A mote eclipse a glorious star, An eyelid hide the sky. And while to clear the view we stay, Lo! the bright hour hath pass'd away; A twilight haze, all dim and grey, Hath quench'd the living gleam. Remember this, thou little child, In hours of Prayer, when fancies wild Betwixt thee and thy Saviour mild Come floating on life's stream. O shame, O grief, when earth's rude toys, An opening door, a breath, a noise, Drive from the heart th' eternal joys, Displace the Lord of Love! For half a prayer perchance on high We soar, and heaven seems bright and nigh, But ah! too soon frail heart and eye Sink down and earthward rove. The Sunday garment glittering gay The Sunday heart will steal away. Then haste thee, ere the fond glance stray, Thy precious robes unfold, And cast before thy Saviour's feet: Him spare not with thy best to greet, Nor dread the dust of Sion's street, 'Tis jewels all and gold. His very shrines, this week of woe, Will doff their rich attire, and show As mourners; fear we then to go In glad and festal guise. Yea, when the funeral days are o'er, And altars shine in gold once more, I bid thee lavish all thy store In fearless sacrifice. The gorgeous hues by sinners worn, Our pride and our good Angel's scorn,— His pavement let them now adorn, Or with His daylight blend. His palace court hath order blest, When from His Throne of earthly rest In glory beams th' immortal Guest, We to the dust descend. 7. IRREVERENCE IN CHURCH. “The Lord is in His Holy Temple: let all the earth keep silence before Him.” O grief for Angels to behold Within Christ's awful home! A child regenerate here of old, And here for lowliest adoration come, Forgetting love and fear, And with bold eye and tone bringing the rude world here! Where is the Cross upon thy brow, Seal of His Love and Might, Whose life-blood earn'd thee power, thy vow To keep, and serve Him in His courts aright? Even in His week of grace, Thou know'st, His ire brake out for His own holy place. Thrice in those seven dread days, we read, He to His Temple came, If haply from the wrath decreed He might redeem th' abode of His great Name; With silent warning Eye, With scourge in Hand, with doom of thrilling Prophecy. On Sunday eve with many a palm, With many a chant divine, It came, that Eye so keen and calm, Like a still lamp, far searching aisle and shrine. Happy the few, that hour, Who with adoring hearts kneel'd to that gaze of power. Nor they unblest, the morrow morn, Who low before Him lay In penitential guise forlorn, And for His sounding scourge made duteous way: Who at His word their store Of earthly goods remov'd, nor ever brought them more. But ah! no blessing left He then, When the third evening fell, And o'er the olive-shaded glen Came wafted to His Mount His stern farewell. “We meet not, till ye own The Crucified and scorn'd before the Judgment Throne.” No blessing left the Lord of bliss, Save on that widow poor, Who only offer'd not amiss, Whose praise for aye shall in His Book endure. What if the place were doom'd? Love will abide the fire: her gift is unconsum'd. Thrice warn'd the dread departing word The city of His choice; And threefold are Thy Lessons, Lord, Even now to reckless eye and heart and voice. Why is there silence here? Why hush the prattling babe? “An unseen Eye we fear.” What are these frowns, and penal ways With rebel hand and tongue? True tokens of the heart's amaze, Where waits beside the door the sacred throng, By sentence heard in Heaven, Of sin-retaining power, out of the Presence driven: Driven for a while: and O! if yet The scornful brow they bend, The saintly Thrones are duly set, The doom prepar'd, that without hope or end The Temple Roof will draw Down on the irreverent head, there lingering without awe. 8. DISRESPECT TO ELDERS. “And he went up from thence unto Beth-el: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them. And he went from thence to Mount Carmel.” The Powers of Ill have mysteries of their own, Their sacramental signs and prayers, Their choral chants in many a winning tone, Their watchwords, seals, processions, known Far off to friend and foe: their lights and perfum'd airs. And even as men, where warring hosts abide, By faint and silent tokens learn At distance whom to trust, from whom to hide, So round us set on every side Th' aërial sentinels our good and ill discern. The lawless wish, the unaverted eye, Are as a taint upon the breeze, To lure foul spirits: haughty brows and high Are signals to invite him nigh, Whose onset ever Saints await on bended knees. Him in some thievish corner of the street Full often lurking low we trace, When sullen lips our kindly glances meet, And looks, that pastoral eyes should greet, As flowers the morn, fall coldly, as on empty space. His poisonous whisper hath been there, be sure, Where childhood's simple courtesies Are scorned: so trains he up his school impure, So may his nursery tasks inure The hearts that by and by against the Church shall rise. Open their eyes, good Lord, that they may know Whose edicts they so dearly hold, Making Thy rites a revel and a show, Where the rude world may come and go, To sit at ease, and judge the Saints and Seers of old. The stubborn knees with holy trembling smite, Which bow not at Thine awful Name. Pour from Thine Altar Thine own glorious Light, Winning the world-enamour'd sight To turn and see which way the healing radiance came. O may our fallen land, though late, unlearn Her reckless unbelieving heart, And in the Gifts, sweet as from Aaron's urn, And in the pure white Robe, discern Signs lingering, faint and few, ere the last Saint depart. O grant us Thy good Angel, evermore To wait, with unseen scourge in hand, On the Church path, and by the low school door. Write in young hearts Thy reverend lore, Nor be our christen'd babes as Beth-el's lawless band. Perhaps among the wailing matrons there Was one who to her child had taught The ways of scorn, breathing the poison'd air Into that bosom fresh and fair Which from her own drew life.—Alas! too well it wrought. Now self-accusing by the drear wood-side She ranges where th' avengers came, In dreams of penance wandering wild and wide. But He, the Healer and the Guide, To Carmel top is gone, far from our woe and shame. Now from his lips the judgment word hath past, The lightning from his awful brow: Low on his knees in some bleak cavern cast, His prayers go up o'er ocean vast For those whom he hath doom'd: he is their Patron now. And our Elisha—fails He on the Mount To plead, His holy ones to pray For rebels and profane?—O who may count The drops from that eternal Fount Of heavenly Intercession, welling night and day? Ye fragrant showers, O were it not for you, How could we breathe the parched air Of the world's freedom, feverish and untrue, Withering each soft and kindly hue Even in young hearts? but ye spring-weather cherish there. Your influence from afar we own and bless, When, school-hours past, o'er village green, Or homely garden, bright in its May dress, Come greetings from a throng and press Of little strangers, prompt as fairies round their queen. Ever, as up and down our glances go, In that fair round we may discern A beaming smile, and an obeisance low;— So forest bluebells in a row Stoop to the first May wind, sweeping o'er each in turn. And here and there, perchance, one graver found A comrade's roving eye may school To courtesy forgot:—so in each round Of duty, here on earth's dull ground, Angels with us rehearse their own majestic Rule. 9. HOME SICKNESS. (For St. Mark's Day.) “If any man come to Me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters yea, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple.” A holy home, young Saint, was thine, Child of a priestly line, Bred where the vernal midnight air Was vocal with the prayer Of Christians fresh from Paschal meat, With supplications strong and sweet, With fast and vigil, in meek strife Winning their Pastor's life. A holy home, a mother bold, Who to the scattered fold Threw wide her door at dead of night, Nor feared the tyrant's might;— The sister true of him who poured His treasure at Thy feet, O Lord: The Son of Comfort named was he By those who hearts could see. A holy home, a refuge-bower For Saints in evil hour, Where child, and slave, and household maid, Of their own joy afraid, As parent's voice familiar own The pastoral Apostolic tone. 'Tis heard, and each the race would win To tell the news within. A holy household! yet beware! Even here may lurk a snare. These home delights, so keen and pure, May not for aye endure. Ere long, perchance, a sterner sound Will summon: where wilt thou be found? Even holy homes may hearts beguile, And mar God's work a while. 10. ILL TEMPER. “Jesus was casting out a Devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the Devil was cast out, the dumb spake.” Not often bends the face of heaven and earth A dull and joyless brow On hearts that own meek love and quiet mirth: But such their aspect now. Slowly and late through leaden skies The scanty lights of morning rise, And hour by weary hour The hard stern outlines loom around Of hill by many a frost embrowned, Pine top, and leafless forest bower. And days have been, wild days of stormy wing, O'er-powering breath and thought, When the dark clouds plied each its heavy sling, And air and ocean wrought As erst o'er Noe, hiding all The bright hues of this earthly ball. The traveller on his way Was like a pinnace on the deep, Whirling around as rude waves sweep, The sport of every gust and spray. So, happy childhood, thine enchanted clime Two evil spirits mar, This wild, that sullen: o'er the unlovely prime Looks out no lingering star, No softly-brightening trail of morn: Their day, in gloom or tempest born, Lowers on till noon and night:— Because the new-born soul made haste Love's christening gift to scorn or waste, Fretting or fierce, in Angels' sight. Yet burns the sun on high beyond the cloud: Each in his southern cave The warm winds linger, but to be allowed One breathing o'er the wave, One flight across the unquiet sky;— Swift as a vane may turn on high The smile of heaven comes on. So waits the Lord behind the veil, His light on frenzied cheek or pale To shed when the dark hour is gone. O ye who feel the dumb deaf spirit's breath About your heart and home, As in foul cavern spreading damps of death, Where only Love should come; Who mark, how wane the lamps of prayer Where sullen thoughts are in the air;— Haste, to the Healer bring The moody silent one: perchance He at the mighty word and glance With Saints will hear, with Angels sing. But if the frenzy fire blaze out, and cast The sparks of Stygian glow, Wild evil words, such showers as rode the blast In Sodom's overthrow; If tossing limb and glaring eye Declare the o'ermastering agony; On Tabor's crown behold The pure calm glory: Jesus there Hath spent the summer night in prayer: There be your tale of anguish told. Faint not, if prayer of man find tardy grace Though saintly knees be bowed, But wait untired beneath the mountain's base Soon will the healing Cloud Toward thee descend,—the voice of Love Through the glad air will gently move:— “Believe, and all may be:”— The voice of Power command afar The rushings of that ireful war, And heart and tongue for prayer be free. Nay, doubt it not: He gave His signs of yore. When Angels at the porch Met thee, and led along the sacred floor, And from their unseen torch Shrank muttering to his penal fire The Demon Shade, companion dire Of all in evil born.— Within thee, if thou wilt, be sure That happy hour's strong spells endure, The seal of heaven, not all outworn. V. Children's Troubles. 1. THE CROSS LAID ON INFANTS. “And as they led Him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.” “Well may I brook the lash of scorn or woe On mine own head to fall: An evil mark is on me: well I know I have deserved it all. But these my tender sheep, What have they sown, such ill to reap? Why should a new-born babe the watch of sorrow keep? Stay thee, sad heart, or e'er thou breathe thy plaint, And still thee, murmuring tongue, And mark who climbs the hill, so meek, so faint, Whose brows with anguish wrung On the rough way drop blood: How rushing round Him like a flood, They drag Him, fallen beneath the accursed and galling wood. Nor him alone. They seize upon his way, Early that fearful morn, One hastening Zion-ward, and on him lay Part of the pain and scorn. Part of the Cross: who knows Which in his secret heart he chose, The persecutor's peace, or the meek Saviour's woes? Bowed he with grudging mind the yoke to bear, Or was the bitter sweet For Jesus' sake? Lo, in the silent air On unseen pinions fleet The hosts of scorn and love: With the sad train they onward move:— Owns he the raven's wing, or the soft gliding Dove? O surely when the healing Rood he felt, The sacrificial fire Of Love redeeming did his spirit melt, And with true heart's desire He set where Jesus trode His steps along the mountain road, Still learning more and more of His sweet awful load. Thou leanest o'er thine infant's couch of pain: It breaks thine heart, to see The wan glazed eye, the wasted arm, that fain Would reach and cling to thee. Yet is there quiet rest Prepared upon the Saviour's breast For babes unconscious borne on Calvary to be blest. Nor to the darlings of thine aching heart, Nor to thine own weak soul, Grudge thou the good Cyrenian's patient part, The Cross that maketh whole Met unawares, and laid Upon the unresisting head, The tottering feet upon the way of sorrow led. What if at times the playful hand, though weak, From the safe bosom part The nursing Father's awful crown to seek, And find it thorns, and start With grieved and wondering call? Who but would joy, one drop should fall Out of his own dull veins, for Him who spared us all? 2. TEARS RESTRAINED. “Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.” “Tears are of Nature's best, they say; An April dry makes cheerless May: Eyes that with answering glow Meet eager joy, I love not well That they should gaze immoveable On sights of fear and woe.” “Nay, soft and wavering shows the hear Whence the life-drops so lightly start, And harsher by and by Will prove, I ween, the withering hour Of selfish care, for each brief shower That hurries down our sky.” Such talk when Angels watching near From earthly guardians overhear, Haply in heart they say, “These are half-truths. Who deeply scan The mystery of the tears of man, To nurse them or allay, “Demands, they know, a mightier skill. He only may the task fulfil, Who hath the springs in hand Of ocean, saying to this wave, ‘Retire:’—to that, ‘unbridled rave High on the thirsty sand.’ “He in His wisdom hath decreed That shingle light, or frail sea-weed, Should here the proud waves stay, There, giant rocks aside be hurled. So in the heart's lone awful world His waters know their way. “His Power the inward storm unchains At will, His power and Love refrains. Ask ye, by what high law? Go not to sage or seer, but trace His impress on some bright young face, Half passion and half awe. “Whom He hath blessed and called His own, He tries them early, look and tone, Bent brow and throbbing heart; Tries them with pain, dread seal of Love. Oft when their ready patience strove With keen o'ermastering smart, “And mortals deemed it gentle blood, Faith might discern the healing Rood Invisibly applied: And when her veil soft Pity drew Over each glad and vernal hue, And babes for others sighed, “A tear, we knew, from Lazarus' grave, Had lent high virtue to the wave In their baptismal hour: Or one of those he deigned to weep O'er Salem, in the olived steep, A world-embalming shower “Thou art stern courage, Heavenly Child, Thou to thy babes art mourning mild; Even as Thy Saints of old From weeping now forbore, now prayed Their eyes might endless showers be made Over Thy fallen fold. “One law is theirs, and thine: to stay Self-loving moans—allow no way For grief that only grieves. But drops that cherish prayer, or speed The pure resolve, or duteous deed,— He gave them, He receives.” 3. LONELINESS. “And He said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? Behold My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself: handle Me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see Me have.” Alone, apart from Mother dear And father's gracious eye, From all the nursery's joyous cheer, Nor babe nor playmate by! A place where others are at home, But all is strange to me! And now the twilight hour is come, And the clear shadows flee. Scarce dare I lay me down and sleep, Lest in half-waking dream Dimly all ways to dance and creep The forms around me seem. Help me with reading, help to pray, That I with spirit free Mine evening hymn may sing or say Upon my bended knee. But look, your lore be true and wise, The lamp ye light burn clear, No flash to pass o'er strained eyes, Leaving all dark and drear.— O kindly and in happy hour Ye bring the Volume blest: There all is Truth, all Love, all Power: Now sweet will be my rest. Now at thy pleasure roam, wild heart, In dreams o'er sea and land: I bid thee at no shadows start. The Upholder is at hand. The lurid hues, the deep sea-gleams, That blend in hour of storm, Till every hurrying night-wind seems To waft a phantom form, Are but His signs, who lonely paced The midnight waters drear. A spirit o'er the heaving waste He seemed—they cried for fear. Hark! in the gale how softly thrills The voice that wakes the dead! Happy, whose ear such music fills By night upon his bed. “'Tis I,” He saith: “be not afraid!” Whether in ocean vast, Or where across the moonlight glade Strange woodland shapes are cast, Or flickering shadows come and go In weary hours of gloom, While midnight lamps burn dim and low, Round some mysterious room, One only spell hath power to soothe When thoughts and dreams appal. Name thou His Name, Who is the Truth, And He will hear thy call; As when new-risen on Easter night Amid His own He stood, Fear with His sudden shade, calm might Came with His Flesh and Blood; Him name in Faith, and softly make The sign to Angels known. So never need thy young heart ache In silence and alone. 4. SHYNESS. “Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.” Tear not away the veil, dear friend, Nor from its shelter rudely rend The heaven-protected flower: It waits for sun and shower To woo it kindly forth in its own time, And when they come, untaught will know its hour of prime. Blame not the eye that from thee turns, The cheek that in a moment burns With tingling fire so bright, Feeling thine eager sight,— The lowly drooping brow, the stammering tongue, The giddy wavering thought, scarce knowing right and wrong. What if herein weak Nature own Her trembling underneath His Throne, Whose eye can ne'er depart From our frail evil heart? Who knows how near His look of awful love The gaze of aged men may to the young heart prove? The springs of silent awe, that dwell Deepest in heart, will highest swell, When in His destined hour He calls them out in power. Hide thou thy face, and fear to look on God, Else never hope to grasp the wonder-working rod. With quivering hands that closely fold Over his downcast eyes, behold The Shephered on the Mount Adores the Living Font Of pure unwasting fire: no glance he steals, But in his heart's deep joy the Dread Eye gazing feels,— Feels it, and gladlier far would die Than let it go. There will he lie Till the Dread Voice return, And he the lore may learn Of his appointed task—bold deeds to dare, High mysteries to impart, deep penances to bear. Ere long to the same holy place He will return, and face to face Upon the glory gaze, Then onward bear the rays To Israel: priest and people from his glance Will shrink, as he from God's in that deep Horeb trance. Then tear we not the veil away, Nor ruthless tell in open day The tender spirit's dream. O let the deepening stream Might from the mountain-springs in silence draw. O mar we not His work, who trains His saints in awe! 5. STAMMERING. “He maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.” When heart and head are both o'erflowing, When eager words within are glowing, And all at once for utterance crowd and throng, How hard to find no tongue! The little babe upon the breast Wails out his wail and is at rest: These may but look and long. Perhaps some deed of sacred story, Or lesson deep of God's high glory, For many a toilsome hour rehears'd or read, In holy Church is said. He knows it all—none half so well,— And longs in turn his tale to tell, But all his words are fled. Perhaps on high the chant is ringing, The youthful choir the free notes flinging. To soar at will the mazy roof around: But his to earth are bound. In every chord his heart beats high, But vainly would his frail lips try The tones his soul hath found. O gaze not so in wistful sadness: Ere long a morn of power and gladness Shall break the heavy dream; the unchained voice Shall in free air rejoice: Thoughts with their words and tones shall meet, The unfaltering tongue harmonious greet The heart's eternal choice. Even now the call that wakes the dying Steals on thine ear with gentle sighing: The breath, the dew of heaven hath touched thy tongue: Far to the winds are flung The bonds unseen, ill spirits' work: Satan no more may round thee lurk, Thine Ephphatha is sung. 6. FEAR OF WILD BEASTS. (For Quinquagesima.) “No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there.” Oft have I hid mine eyes, When lightning thrill'd across the midnight skies: When tempests howl'd o'er land or main, Oft have I thought upon the deluge rain. But now I read, that never more Will Heaven's dread windows so give out their awful store. The rainbow-sign is given,— His word endures in Heaven. Oft have I shrank for fear, When forms that seem'd of giant mould drew near, And deeply in my childish heart I thrill'd at every rush, and bound, and start: But now I hear th' Eternal Law That binds them in His chain of deep mysterious awe: I fear no monster birth, His word endures on earth. Even as the bright calm bow Is safety's pledge when waters wild o'erflow, As horned herds will turn and fly If but a child survey them with bold eye, So in the storms we may not see Thy Saviour's rainbow crown, O Faith, thine own may be: So, if His Cross he raise, Hell powers at distance gaze. There may we calmly dwell, Nor sounding tempest dread, nor lion fell. But, little children, muse and mark: His blessing waits on inmates of His ark, On such as in His awful shade Abide, and keep the seal His Holy Spirit made. Else will the flood awake, His chain the Lion break. 7. SEPARATION. “For she said, If I may touch but His clothes, I shall be whole.” She did but touch with finger weak The border of His sacred vest, Nor did He turn, nor glance, nor speak, Yet found she health and rest. Well may the word sink deep in me, For I, full many a fearful hour, Fast clinging, mother dear, to thee, Have felt Love's guardian power. When looks were strange on every side, When gazing round I only saw Far-reaching ways, unknown and wide, I could but nearer draw: I could but nearer draw, and hold Thy garment's border as I might. This while I felt, my heart was bold, My step was free and light. Thou haply on thy path the while Didst seem unheeding me to fare, Scarce now and then, by bend or smile, Owning a playmate there. What matter? well I knew my place, Deep in my mother's inmost heart: I fear'd but, in my childish race, I from her robe might part. O Lord, the Fount of Mother's Love And Infant's Faith, I hear thee mourn: “Thee, tender as a callow dove, Long have I nurs'd and borne: “Have nurs'd and borne thee up on high, Ere Mother's love to thee was known: And now I set thee down, to try If thou canst walk alone. “Nay, not alone—but I would prove Thy duteous heart. O grudge no more Thy Lord His joy, when healing Love His very robe flows o'er.” 8. BEREAVEMENT. “The Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.” I mark'd when vernal meads were bright, And many a primrose smil'd, I mark'd her, blithe as morning light, A dimpled three years' child. A basket on one tender arm Contain'd her precious store Of spring-flowers in their freshest charm, Told proudly o'er and o'er. The other wound with earnest hold About her blooming guide, A maid who scarce twelve years had told: So walk'd they side by side. One a bright bud, and one might seem A sister flower half blown. Full joyous on their loving dream The sky of April shone. The summer months swept by: again That loving pair I met. On russet heath, and bowery lane, Th' autumnal sun had set: And chill and damp that Sunday eve Breath'd on the mourners' road That bright-eyed little one to leave Safe in the Saints' abode. Behind, the guardian sister came, Her bright brow dim and pale— O cheer thee, maiden! in His Name, Who still'd Jairus' wail! Thou mourn'st to miss the fingers soft That held by thine so fast, The fond appealing eye, full oft Tow'rd thee for refuge cast. Sweet toils, sweet cares, for ever gone! No more from stranger's face Or startling sound, the timid one Shall hide in thine embrace. Thy first glad earthly task is o'er, And dreary seems thy way. But what if nearer than before She watch thee even to-day? What if henceforth by Heaven's decree She leave thee not alone, But in her turn prove guide to thee In ways to Angels known? O yield thee to her whisperings sweet: Away with thoughts of gloom! In love the loving spirits greet, Who wait to bless her tomb. In loving hope with her unseen Walk as in hallow'd air. When foes are strong and trials keen, Think, “What if she be there?” 9. ORPHANHOOD. “Behold thy Mother.” Oft have I watch'd thy trances light, And longed for once to be A partner in thy dream's delight, And smile in sleep with thee; To sport again, one little hour, With the pure gales, that fan thy nursery bower, And as of old undoubting upward spring, Feeling the breath of heaven beneath my joyous wing. But rather now with thee, dear child, Fain would I lie awake, For with no feverish care and wild May thy clear bosom ache; Thy woes go deep, but deeper far The soothing power of yonder kindly star: Thy first soft slumber on thy mother's breast Was never half so sweet as now thy calm unrest. Thy heart is sad to think upon Thy mother far away, Wondering perchance, now she is gone, Who best for thee may pray. In many a waking dream of love Thou seest her yet upon her knees above: The vows she breathed beside thee yesternight, She breathes above thee now, winged with intenser might. Both vespers soft and matins clear For thee she duly pays, Now as of old, and there as here; Nor yet alone she prays. Thy vision—(whoso chides, may blame The instinctive reachings of the Altar flame) Shows thee above, in yon ethereal air, A holier Mother, rapt in more prevailing prayer. 'Tis she to whom thy heart took flight Of old in joyous hour, When first a precious sister spright Came to thy nursery bower, And thou with earnest tone didst say, “Mother, let Mary be her name, I pray, For dearly do I love to think upon That gracious Mother-Maid, nursing her Holy One.” Then in delight, as now in woe, Thou to that home didst turn, Where God, an Infant, dwelt below: The thoughts that ache and burn Nightly within thy bosom, find A home in Nazareth to their own sweet mind. More than all music are the soothings dear Which meet thee at that door, and whisper, Christ is here. 10. FIRE. “The Angel of the Lord made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind.” Sweet maiden, for so calm a life Too bitter seemed thine end; But thou hadst won thee, ere that strife, A more than earthly friend. We miss thee in thy place at school, And on thine homeward way, Where violets by the reedy pool Peep out so shyly gay: Where thou, a true and gentle guide, Wouldst lead thy little band, With all an elder sister's pride, And rule with eye and hand. And if we miss, O who may speak What thoughts are hovering round The pallet where thy fresh young cheek Its evening slumber found? How many a tearful longing look In silence seeks thee yet, Where in its own familiar nook Thy fireside chair is set? And oft when little voices dim Are feeling for the note In chanted prayer, or psalm, or hymn. And wavering wildly float, Comes gushing o'er a sudden thought Of her who led the strain, How oft such music home she brought— But ne'er shall bring again. O say not so! the springtide air Is fraught with whisperings sweet; Who knows but heavenly carols there With ours may duly meet? Who knows how near, each holy hour, The pure and child-like dead May linger, where in shrine or bower The mourner's prayer is said? And He who will'd, thy tender frame (O stern yet sweet decree!) Should wear the Martyr's robe of flame, He hath prepared for thee A garland in that region bright Where infant spirits reign, Ting'd faintly with such golden light As crowns His Martyr train. Nay doubt it not: His tokens sure Were round her death-bed shewn: The wasting pain might not endure, 'Twas calm ere life had flown, Even as we read of Saints of yore: Her heart and voice were free To crave one quiet slumber more Upon her Mother's knee. 11. PUNISHMENT. “They shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity.” The scourge in hand of God or Man Full deeply tries the secret soul. Yon dark-eyed maid, her bearing scan; The tear that from beneath her quivering eyelids stole, The shade, that hangs e'en now Upon her wistful brow,— It comes not all of shame or pain, But she with pitying heart full fain Would twice the penance burthen bear, Might she the chastening arm, so lov'd and loving, spare. So have I mark'd some faithful hound, Recall'd by look and voice severe, Come conscious of his broken bound, And lowly cast him down as in remorseful fear, One of the teachers true Commission'd to imbue Our dull hard hearts with heavenly skill, With heavenly love our proud cold will. How seems he penance to implore, Patient in woe decreed, and humbly seeking more! He who of old at Caiaphas' door Denied th' eternal Holy One,— In words denied, but own'd in store Of penitential tears—why made he restless moan, When the forgiving Eye Had beam'd on him so nigh, And thrice, for his denials three, The Lord had said, My Shepherd be? Yet were his waking thoughts self-blame, And ever with cock-crowing tearful memory came. For should the soul that loves indeed Stoop o'er the edge of deadly sin, And e'er so lightly taste its meed,— Though wonder-working grace might heal the wound within, Yet may the scar and stain To the last fire remain, And Love will mourn them: loyal Love Will for the Holy Friend above Lament in reverent sympathy, Feeling upon her heart the griev'd and gracious Eye. Alas for sullen souls, that turn Keen wholesome airs to poison blight! Touch'd with Heaven's rod, in ire they burn, Or in dim anguish writhe: beside them in its might The saving Cross we rear, They neither love nor fear; Each from his own unblessed tree The five dread Wounds unmov'd they see— O hard of heart!—and scornful say, “Saviour, if such thou be, come chase our pangs away.” Th' impenitent would still abate His pain, the mourner still enhance.— O Lord, I know my sin is great, I would not hide away from thee in heartless trance; When penal lightnings glare, O give me grace, to bare My sinful bosom to the blast;— Nor, when the judgment hour is past, Bask on in warmth of worldly ease, But hold to the wrong'd Cross on worn and aching knees. 12. PENANCE. “If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.” Thou, who with eye too sad and wan Dost on the memory gaze Of evil days, Open thy casement, moody man, Look out into the midnight air, And taste the gushing fragrance there, Drink of the balm the soft winds bear From dewy nook and flowery maze: They rise and fall, they come and go, With touch ethereal whispering low Of grace to penitential woe, And of the soothing hand that Love on Conscience lays. How welcome, in the sweet still hour, Falls on the weary heart, Listening apart, Each rustling note from breeze and bower The mimic rain mid poplar leaves, The mist drops from th' o'erloaded eaves, Sighs that the herd half-dreaming heaves, Or owlet chanting his dim part; Or trickling of imprison'd rill Heard faintly down some pastoral hill, His pledge, who rules the froward will With more than kingly power, with more than wizard art. But never mourner's ear so keen Watch'd for the soothing sounds That walk their rounds Upon the moonlight air serene, As the bright sentinels on high Stoop to receive each contrite sigh, When the hot world hath hurried by, And souls have time to feel their wounds. Nor ever tenderest bosom beat So truly to the noiseless feet Of shadows that from light clouds fleet, Where ocean gently rocks within his summer bounds, As Saints around the Glory-Throne To each faint sigh respond, And yearning fond, Of Penitents that inly moan. O surely Love adoring there Is quicken'd to intenser prayer, When youthful hearts are fain to wear— Unbidden wear—their penance-bond: When stripling grave and maiden meek Forego the bright hours of the week, Nor at the board their place will seek:— “Have we not sinn'd? and sin must be by pain aton'd.” Thrice happy, in Repentance' school So early taught and tried! At Jesus' side, And by His dread Fore-runner's rule, Train'd from the womb! nor they unblest, Who underneath the world's bright vest With sackcloth tame their aching breast, The sharp-edged cross in jewels hide:— Who day by day and year by year Survey the Past with deepening fear, Yet hourly with more hopeful ear To the dim Future turn, th' absolving Voice abide. Not as lost Esau mourn'd, they mourn; No loud and bitter cry They cast on high: But on through silent air is borne The fragrance of their tearful love To the Redeemer's feast above. Fresher than steam of dewy grove, When April showers are twinkling nigh, To aged husbandman at eve, Is the sweet breath the Heavens receive When bosoms with confession heave, When lowly Magdalen hath won her Saviour's eye. 13. LANGUOR For the leading idea in these lines, the author is indebted to a friend, the writer of the stanzas in p. 10, entitled “The First Smile.”. “There is joy in Heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.” Come, and with us by summer seas The revel hold of Mirth and Ease. Together now, and now apart, Three happy sprites, we glide and dart O'er rock and sand, as free and bright As waves that leap in morning light;— Or mark in playful pensiveness How fast the evening clouds undress O'er gleaming waters far away, And by the tir'd Sun gently lay Their robes of glory, to be worn More gorgeous with returning morn. There, and where'er our fancies roam, Our trusting hearts are still at home, For at our side we feel Our father's smile, our mother's glance. Say, can this earth a loving trance Of deeper bliss reveal? Yes: from the shore with us return, And thou a deeper bliss shalt learn, Just as the mounting sun hath drawn Warm fragrance from the thymy lawn, Come to our cottage home, and see If aught of sprightly, fresh, and free, With the calm sweetness may compare Of the pale form half slumbering there, Our little sister, late as gay As sea-lark drench'd in ocean spray, Now from her couch of languor freed One hour upon soft air to feed. O gently tread, and mildly gaze, Ill may she brook our bolder ways; The babe who cannot speak Tempers, to her, his strong caress; Lightly the small soft fingers press The wan and wearied cheek. And if in festive hour, beside The laughing waves and tuneful tide, Parental eyes for joy grow dim, What notes may trace the heart's deep hymn, In silence mingling with the breath Of child by prayer recall'd from death, Or with the pulse's healthier chime In praise melodious keeping time? O, when its flower seems fain to die, The full heart grudges smile or sigh To aught beside, though fair and dear. Like a bruis'd leaf, at touch of Fear Its hidden fragrance Love gives out. Therefore, this one dear couch about We linger hour by hour: The love that each to each we bear, All treasures of endearing care, Into her lap we pour. Type of that holiest Family, When smitten souls, at point to die, Come darkling home, prepar'd to wait In doubt and dimness by the gate. Then far along the mournful way Paternal Love speeds out, to say The words of welcome; Angels bear The robe, sweet pledge of pardoning care; And as he daily seeks aright His lowly station in their sight, They watch th' all-ruling Eye, for leave Some flower of Paradise to give, Bid amaranth odours round him float, Or breathe into his ear one note Of that high loving strain, Which rings from all the harps of Heaven, When from the Shrine the word is given, “The dead soul lives again.” O, if the Powers and Thrones above Hover with crowns of joy and love, Ungrudg'd, unsparing, over brows That mourn in dust their broken vows, Rather than where the Saints are seen Each reigning in his place serene:— If in Love's earthly home and bower The mournful or the dangerous hour Unblam'd each prayer and longing guides To the one couch where Pain abides:— He who is Love, and owns Love's Name, Is in His ocean springs the same As in each little murmuring brook That cheers soft mead or wayside nook: Brighter the joy, be sure, Before Him, where one sinner weeps, Than where, in Heaven's unchanging deeps, A thousand orbs endure. VI. Children's Sports. 1. GARDENING. “He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much.” Seest thou yon woodland child, How amid flowerets wild, Wilder himself, he plies his pleasure-task? That ring of fragrant ground, With its low woodbine bound, He claims: no more, as yet, his little heart need ask. There learns he flower and weed To sort with careful heed: He waits not for the weary noontide hour. There with the soft night air Comes his refreshing care: Each tiny leaf looks up, and thanks him for the shower. Thus faithful found awhile, He wins the joyous smile Of friend or parent: glad and bright is he, When for his garland gay He hears the kind voice say, “Well hast thou wrought, dear boy: the garden thine shall be.” And when long years are flown, And the proud word, Mine Own, Familiar sounds, what joy in field or bower To view by Memory's aid Again that garden glade, And muse on all the lore there learned in each bright hour! Is not a life well-spent A child's play-garden, lent For Heaven's high trust to train young heart and limb? When in yon field on high Our hard-won powers we try, Will no mild tones of earth blend with the adoring hymn? O fragrant, sure, will prove The breath of patient Love, Even from these fading sweets by Memory cast, As deepening evermore To Him our song we pour, Who lent us Earth, that He might give us Heaven at last. 2. MAY GARLANDS. “The sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth.” Come, ye little revellers gay, Learners in the school of May, Bring me here the richest crown Wreathed this morn on breezy down, Or in nook of copsewood green, Or by river's rushy screen, Or in sunny meadow wide, Gemmed with cowslips in their pride; Or perchance, high prized o'er all, From beneath the southern wall, From the choicest garden bed, 'Mid bright smiles of infants bred, Each a lily of his own Offering, or a rose half-blown. Bring me now a crown as gay, Wreathed and woven yesterday. Where are now those forms so fair?— Withered, drooping, wan and bare, Feeling nought of earth or sky, Shower or dew, behold they lie, Vernal airs no more to know:— They are gone—and ye must go, Go where all that ever bloomed, In its hour must lie entombed.— They are gone; their light is o'er:— Ye must go; but ye once more Hope in joy to be new-born, Lovelier than May's gleaming morn. Hearken, children of the May, Now in your glad hour and gay, Ye whom all good Angels greet With their treasures blithe and sweet:— None of all the wreaths ye prize But was nursed by weeping skies. Keen March winds, soft April showers, Braced the roots, embalmed the flowers. So, if e'er that second spring Her green robe o'er you shall fling, Stern self-mastery, tearful prayer, Must the way of bliss prepare. How should else Earth's flowerets prove Meet for those pure crowns above? 3. SUNDAY NOSEGAYS. “He that humbleth himself shall be exalted.” Ye children that on Jesus wait, Gathering around His temple gate To learn His word and will, For glory hungered and athirst,— Which of you all would fain be first? Come here and take your fill. Come, still and pure as drops of dew, Come to the feast prepared for you, Your prayer in silence breathe;— Seek the last room, the scorn'd of all: If that be filled, adoring fall The Holy Board beneath. Not to the quick untrembling gaze, The heart that bounds at human praise, Loves He to say, Go higher. But most He turns His face away, When envy's sidelong eyes betray The foul unhallowed fire. Say, little maids that love the spring, Of all the fragrant gems ye bring For bower or bridal wreath, Is aught so fair as violets shy, Betraying where they lowly lie By the soft airs they breathe? Oft as with mild caressing hand Ye cull and bind in tender band Those bashful flowers so sweet, With many a Sunday smile,—to rest Upon some loved and honoured breast, A welcome gift and meet,— Ye to the Heaven-taught soul present A token and a sacrament, How to the highest room Earth's lowliest flowers our Lord receives: Close to His heart a place He gives, Where they shall ever bloom. 4. DRESSING UP. “Put on the whole armour of God.” Great is the joy when leave is won, On sun-bright holiday, To deck some passive little one In fancy-garments gay: Whether it be a bright-haired boy With brow so bold and high, Or maiden elf with aspect coy, Grave lip and laughing eye. What flashes of quick thought are there, What deep delight and pride! Till the whole house the wonder share, From room to room they glide. You smile, their eager ways to see: But mark their choice, when they To choose their sportive garb are free, The moral of their play. In semblance proud of warrior's mail The stripling shall appear, The maiden meek in robe and veil Shall mimic bridal gear. All thoughtless they, to thoughtful eyes Love-tokens high present:— The Bride descending from the skies, The mail in Baptism lent. Yes: fearless may he lift the brow, Who bears, unstained and bright, By touch of Angels sealed e'en now, His Saviour's Cross of might. Radiant may be her glance of mirth, Who wears her chrisom-vest Pure as when first at her new birth It wrapt her tender breast. O, if so fair the first dim ray In Jesus' morn of grace, How will it glow, His perfect Day, On our triumphant race! If but His banner's hovering shade May scare the infernal band, How strong, who to the end arrayed In His full armour stand! Then haste, young warrior, year by year, And day by day, and hour By hour, His armoury to draw near, And don His robes of Power. Thy girdle, Truth—to hate a lie:— Then, purpose high of soul In Righteousness to live and die, Thy breastplate, firm and whole. Then, heavenly Calmness, lest thou fall Where scandals line the way; Faith in the Unseen, thy shield o'er all, Each fiery dart to stay. Hope in His gift, thine helmet sure; Trust in His living Word Thy weapon keen, to chase the impure, His Spirit's awful sword. This is thine armour, bathed in heaven: Keep thou by prayer and fast Thy Saviour's seal, so early given:— All shall be thine at last. 5. PEBBLES ON THE SHORE. “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.” Not undelightful prove The rounds of restless love, When high and low she searches, mine and mart, And turns and tosses o'er Some crowned merchant's store, And scarce fit token finds of the full yearning heart. Yet in Heaven's searching beam As bright may haply seem A child's unpurchased offering, stone or shell, Found by some joyous crew Glittering with ocean dew, Where feathery lines of spray the waves' last boundary tell. Behold them, how they dance Beneath the breezy glance Of April morn, or fresh October noon;— How on the twinkling sand, In many a fairy band, They leave their foot-prints light, to turn and count them soon. What if some nursing friend His sportive counsel lend To sort the treasure, wreathe the chaplet gay, Coral or crimson weed?— Then is it joy indeed, When he to mind recalls some comrade far away. Oh then how bright arise To fancy's quick young eyes The smiles that o'er the kindling brow will spread, When on the nursery floor They range their bounteous store, Precious to them as pearls from India's ocean-bed! What though unseen, unbought By money, toil, or thought, Those simple offerings—come they not of Love? Love gives, and Love will take. Such are the vows we make To the dread Bethlehem Babe, nor He will them reprove. What is a royal crown, Or first-born babe, cast down Before His Cradle, to one heavenly smile? We may not buy nor earn, But he toward us will turn Of His own Love: but we must kneel in Love the while. Thus learn we Bounty's lore Along the unbounded shore:— And even beneath the mists which man hath made, Where Mammon walks the street, We light on memories sweet Of a dread Bargain sealed, a countless Ransom paid. We hear the frequent cry, “Approach, ye poor, and buy, Buy of the best for nought:”—and dreams arise Of yon supernal Home, And Angel voices—“Come, Come to the Living Wells, buy without gold or price. “Come to the true Vine's shade, There in contrition laid Drink of the drops He in your cup shall press. Come to the quiet fold, And while the lambs are told, Taste the pure treasure of the pastoral wilderness.” The homeless and forlorn In cities,—think they scorn Freely to quaff the fountain's unbought store? Freely to learn the song It warbles all night long In murmurings such as soothed their cradle dreams of yore? 6. BATHING. “Lord, if it be Thou, bid me come unto Thee on the water.” The May winds gently lift the willow leaves; Around the rushy point comes weltering slow The brimming stream; alternate sinks and heaves The lily-bud, where small waves ebb and flow. Willowherb and meadowsweet! Ye the soft gales, that visit there, From your waving censers greet With store of freshest balmiest air. Come bathe—the steaming noontide hour invites Even in your face the sparkling waters smile.— Yet on the brink they linger, timid wights, Pondering and measuring; on their gaze the while Eddying pool and shady creek Darker and deeper seem to grow: On and onward still, they seek Where sport may less adventurous show. At length the boldest springs: but ere he cleave The flashing waters, eye and thought grow dim; Too rash it seems, the firm green earth to leave: Heaven is beneath him: shall he sink or swim? Far in boundless depth he sees The rushing clouds obey the gale, Trembling hands and tottering knees, All in that dizzy moment fail. Oh mark him well, ye candidates of Heaven, Called long ago to float in Jesus' ark Ye know not where:—His signal now is given, The Lord draws near upon the waters dark: To your eager prayer the Voice Makes awful answer: “Come to me: Once for all now seal your choice, With Christ to tread the boisterous sea.” And dare we come? since he, the trusted Saint, Who with one only shared the Lord's high love, Shrank from the tossing gale, and scarce with faint And feeble cry toward the Saviour strove. Yes: we answer the dread call, Not fearless, but in duteous awe: He will stay the frail heart's fall, His arm will onward, upward draw. O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt? Spare not for Him to walk the midnight wave, On the dim shore at morn to seek Him out St. John xxi., Work 'neath His Eye, and near Him make thy grave. So backslidings past no more Shall in the heavens remembered be, Faith the Three Denials sore O'erpaying with Confessions Three. Strange power of mighty Love! if Heaven allow Choice, on the restless waters rather found, Meeting her Lord, with cross and bleeding brow, Than calmly waiting on the guarded ground! Yearning ever to spring forth And feel the cold waves for His sake;— All her giving of no worth, Yet, till she give, her heart will ache. 7. ENACTING HOLY RITES. “Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.” They talk of wells in caverns deep, Whose waters run a wondrous race Far underground, and issuing keep Our floating tokens, bright or base. So in the child's light play we read The portion to the man decreed; His future self he hastes to prove In art, in toil, in warfare, or in love. Those waves emerging far away, True to their fount, the likeness bear Of fancies nurtur'd many a day, How in the end their course they wear Into the light of Manhood free: The hidden soul breaks out, and we In careless mien, in careworn face, The long-forgotten Infant wondering trace. Oh, many a joyous mother's brow Is sadden'd o'er when sports are rife, And watching by, she seems e'en now The tale to read of coming strife. Through lawless camp, o'er ocean wild, Her prophet eye pursues her child, Scans mournfully her Poet's strain, Fears, for her Merchant, loss alike and gain. But if a holier task engage His busy dream, if clad in white She see him turn some hallow'd page, Dimly enact some awful rite,— Then high beyond the loftiest Heaven The flight that to her hopes is given, And darker than the gloomiest deep The fears that in her boding bosom creep. She sees in heart an empty Throne, And falling, falling far away, Him whom the Lord had placed thereon; She hears the dread Proclaimer say, “Cast ye the lot, in trembling cast Acts i.; The traitor to his place hath past.”— Strive ye with Prayer and Fast to guide The dangerous Glory where it shall abide: Guide it towards some serious brow, In love and patience lowly bent, Some youthful Athanase “Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria, on a certain day being in his own house, cast his eyes towards the sea, and seeing afar off boys playing on the shore, and enacting a Bishop and the customs of the Church, as long as he saw nothing too adventurous in their play, was pleased with what he saw, and amused himself with their doings. But when they touched even upon the Mysteries, he was troubled, and summoning the Clergy, made them observe the boys: whom having caused to be brought before him, he interrogated about their play, and the kind of things said and done therein;...and they informed him that Athanasius was their Bishop and director, and that he had baptized some of the lads who were unchristened. Of these Alexander made careful inquiry, what had been asked of them, or done to them, by him who was Priest in their name, and what they answered, and were taught to say. And finding that all the order of the Church had been accurately observed in their case, he deemed, on consulting with the Priests about him, that there was no need to rebaptize such as had once for all received the grace of God in simplicity. Only he performed for them the other ceremonies, which the Priests alone may lawfully minister in the Sacraments. Moreover, Athanasius and the other boys, who in their sport were Priests and Deacons, he commended to their respective kinsmen, calling God to witness; to be nurtured for the Church, and trained to that which they had enacted...” Sozomen, Eccl. Hist. i. 17., e'en now Upon his future task intent; His Creed rehearsing to the roar Of billows on the lonely shore, Or with a child's deep earnestness Showing his mates how Saints baptize and bless. She hears: one glance,—how brief and keen!— As with a lightning touch reveals Her Saint upon his path serene; With all her heart his vow she seals, With all her heart the prayer prolongs, That round him still the Watchers' songs Echoing may purge the hallow'd air, And from his soul the dreams of Judas scare. Ever in hope and agony She prays:—in hope when most he fears, In trembling when his hopes mount high. Far, far away she feels, not hears A deep chord thrill, an answering note Go forth in Heaven, and earthward float. Her Guardian Angel wafts it nigh, But more it breathes than Angel sympathy. Yea, gloom was on the Source of Light St. John xiii. 21., A trouble at Joy's very heart, When with the Traitor in His sight His secret sad He told apart. And when He spake of treasures seal'd To proud wise men, to babes reveal'd St. Matt. xi. 25., From His celestial aspect fell A lightning as in Heaven, a bliss ineffable. These are Thy signs, Thou Shepherd good, To Daring and to Meekness given: To babes of mild, self-chastening mood, Whispering their part in chants of Heaven. “Else,” warning Love cries out, “beware Of Chancel screen and Altar stair.” Love interceding kneels in fear, Lest to the Pure th' unholy draw too near. VII. Lessons of Nature. 1. VERNAL MIRTH. “Behold the fig tree, and all the trees; when they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand.” What is the joy the young lambs know, When vernal breezes blow? Why carol out so blithe and free The little birds, from every leafless tree? Why bound so high the boys at play On grass so green and gay? From nursing arms, his proper throne, Why rings so clear yon infant's joyous tone? The life that in them deeply dwells Of genial spring-tide tells: Of their own selves they see and know To what glad tune the summer brooks shall flow. Be thou through life a little child; By manhood undefiled; So shall no Angel grudge thy dreams Of fragrance pure and ever brightening beams. 2. THE BIRD'S NEST. As an eagle stirreth up her nest, so the Lord alone did lead him.” Behold the treasure of the nest, The winged mother's hope and pride: See how they court her downy breast, How soft they slumber, side by side. Strong is the life that nestles there, But into motion and delight It may not burst, till soft as air It feel Love's brooding, timely might. Even such a blissful nest I deem The cradle of the Lord's new-born, Where deeply lurks the living beam Lit in the glad baptismal morn. But into keen enduring flame It may not burst, till heavenly Love Have o'er it spread, in Christ's dear Name, The pinions of His brooding Dove.— Now steal once more across the lawn, Stoop gently through the cypress bough, And mark which way life's feeble dawn Works in their little hearts, and how. Still close and closer, as you pry, They nestle 'neath their mother's plume, Or with a faint forlorn half-cry, Shivering bewail her empty room. Or haply, as the branches wave, The little round of tender bills Is raised, the due repast to crave Of her who all their memory fills. Hast thou no wisdom here to learn, Thou nestling of the Holy Dove, How hearts that with the true life burn Live by the pulse of filial love? When sorrow comes to thy calm nest, Early or late, as come it will, Think of yon brood, yon downy breast, And hide thee deep in Jesus' will. By morning and by evening moan, As doves beneath the cedar spray, Make thou thy fearful longings known To Him who is not far away. Him Cherub-borne in royal state, The food of His Elect to be, With eager lip do thou await, And veiled brow, and trembling knee. So underneath the warm bright wing, The hidden grace of thy new birth Shall gather might to soar and sing, Where'er He bids, in heaven or earth. 3. THE MOTHER BIRD WITH HER YOUNG. “How often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!” The Lord who lends His creatures all A tongue to preach His will— To Salem came His mournful call, His last sad word to Sion's wall, From the green Eastern hill. The little children waiting by Wondered to see Him weep. The louder swelled the duteous cry, As He in lowliest majesty Rode down the shady steep. Thy little heart, so wild and weak, Perhaps is musing now, “Had I the joy to hear Him speak, To see that Eye, so heavenly meek, Sure I should keep my vow.” Nay, in that hour He thought on thee, And left a token sure, Ever in times of vernal glee Around thee in thy walks to be, And keep thee kind and pure. Look how the Hen invites her brood Beneath her wing to lie, Look how she calls them to their food, How eyes, in eager, dauntless mood, The wheeling hawk on high. So would thy Lord His pinions spread Around thee, night and day, So lead thee, where is heavenly Bread, So, by the Cross whereon He bled, The spoiler scare away. But be thou gathered:—one and all Those simple nestlings see, How hurrying at their mother's call, To their one home, whate'er befall, In faith entire they flee. 4. NOONTIDE. “They looked stedfastly toward Heaven as He went up. The shepherd boy lies on the hill At noon with upward eye; Deep on his gaze and deeper still Ascends the clear blue sky. You pass him by, and deem perchance He lies but half awake, And picture in what airy trance His soul may sport or ache. Full wakeful he, both eye and heart, For he a cloud hath seen Into that waste of air depart, As bark in ocean green. 'Tis gone, and he is musing left;— What if in such array Our Saviour through the aërial cleft Rose on Ascension Day? That hour, a glorious cloud, we know, Hid Him from human sight, While pastoral eyes were strained below To trace Him through the light. Oh if but once such awful thought, In sleep or waking dream, At night or noontide, came unsought, Like haunting sound of stream, Surely thou durst not let it go; Oft as thine eye shall turn Where overhead the clear deeps glow, Thine heart must inly burn, Wondering what mortal first shall view The dread returning sign, When the strong portals, raised anew, Disclose the march divine. Blest shall he be, that sinner's child, If upward in that tide His eye be turned, nor wandering wild, Nor closed in inward pride: Blest, if the glory o'er him break Through chancel roof, or where Some mourner's bed good Angels make, And Pain is soothed by Prayer. 5. THE GLEANERS. “They joy before Thee according to the joy in harvest.” The Church is one wide Harvest Field, Where Time and Death are gathering in Rich blessings by the Almighty Owner sealed For spirits meet His pardoning word to win. We are as children: here and there A few fallen ears, the sheaves among, We glean, where best the bounteous Hand may spare, So learning for His perfect store to long. Come, little ones, come early out, Come joyous, come with steady heart, Roam not to seek wild flowers the field about, Nor yet at dreams of fancied vipers start. The sun of Autumn climbs full fast; He will have quaffed each drop of dew, Ere half the fragrant, heathy lane be passed; The lingerers, they will find scant ears and few. Come, quit your toys, and haste away. But mark: ye may not leave behind Your store of smiles, your gladsome talk and gay. Your pure thoughts, fashioned to your Master's mind. Blithe be your course, yet bear in heart The lame and old, and help them on; Full handfuls drop, where they may take a part, As high will swell your heap when day is done. Yon slumbering infant in the shade,— Grudge not one hour on him to wait While others glean. The work with singing aid, With ready mirth all sharper tones abate. Sing softly in your heart all day Sweet carols to the Harvest's Lord, So shall ye chase those evil powers away That walk at noon—rude gaze and wanton word. But see the tall elm shadows reach Athwart the field, the rooks fly home, The light streams gorgeous up the o'er-arching beech, With the calm hour soft weary fancies come. In heaven the low red harvest moon, The glow-worm on the dewy ground, Will light us home with our glad burdens soon; Grave be our evening prayers, our slumbers sound. 6. AUTUMN BUDS. “The children crying in the Temple, Hosanna to the Son of David.” How fast these autumn leaves decay!— But nearer view the naked spray, And many a bud thine eye will meet Prepared with ready smile to greet The showers and gleams of spring. Such buds of hope are Advent hours: Ere the Old Year its leaves and flowers Have shed, the New in promise lives; Christmas afar glad token gives, Soft carols faintly ring. So when our Lord in meekness rode Where few save wintry hearts abode, Each leaf on Judah's sacred tree Was withered, wan, and foul to see, Touched by the frost-wind's wing. Yet lurk'd there tender gems beneath, Ere long to bloom in glorious wreath. While Priest and Scribe looked on and frowned, His little ones came chanting round Hosanna to their King. 7. THE OAK. “What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?” Come take a woodland walk with me, And mark the rugged old Oak Tree, How steadily his arm he flings Where from the bank the fresh rill springs, And points the waters' silent way Down the wild maze of reed and spray. Two furlongs on they glide unseen, Known only by the livelier green. There stands he, in each time and tide, The new-born streamlet's guard and guide. To him spring shower and summer sun, Brown autumn, winter's sleet, are one. But firmest in the bleakest hour He holds his root in faith and power, The splinter'd bark, his girdle stern, His robe, grey moss and mountain fern. Mark'st thou in him no token true Of heaven's own Priests, both old and new, In penitential garb austere Fix'd in the wild, from year to year The lessons of stern love to teach, To penitents and children preach, Bold words and eager glances stay, And gently level Jesus' way? 8. THE PALM. “Palma virens semper manet conservatione et diuturnitate, non immutatione foliorum.” St. Ambrose, Hexaemeron, iii. 71. Why of all the woodland treasure, Holy Palm, art thou preferred, When the voice of praise is heard, When we tread our thankful measure? Why before our Saviour borne? Why by glorious Spirits worn? Is it for thy verdure, brightest In the zone of colours bright? Or that with aërial height Thou the genial clime requitest, Like courageous mountain maid, Nor of sun nor air afraid? Is it that in antique story Conquerors owned thee for their meed? Nay, thine honours are decreed For thy green unchanging glory, Wearing thy first leafy crown, Till thy vigorous life die down. Pines may tower, and laurels flourish— Deathless green is only thine; Type of hearts which airs divine Cheer, and high communions nourish, Hearts on whose pure virgin wreath Sin indulg'd might never breathe. 9. THE WATERFALL. “Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual House” “I will make thy seed as the dust of the Earth.” “What is the Church, and what am I? A world, to one poor sandy grain, A waste of sea and sky To one frail drop of rain. “What boots one feeble infant tone To the full choir denied or given, Where millions round the Throne Are chanting, morn and even?” Nay, the kind Watchers hearkening there Distinguish in the deep of song Each little wave, each air Upon the faltering tongue. Each half note in the great Amen, Even by the utterer's self unheard, They store: O fail not then To bring thy lowly word: Spare not to swell the bold acclaim: So in the future battle-shout, When at the Saviour's Name The Church shall call thee out, No doubtful sound thy trump shall pour. Remember, when in earlier days Thou toil'dst upon the floor Palace or tower to raise, No mimic stone but found a place, And glorious to the builder shone The pile: then how should Grace One living gem disown, One pearly mote, one diamond small, One sparkle of th' unearthly light?— Go where the waters fall Sheer from the mountain's height; Mark how, a thousand streams in one, One in a thousand, on they fare, Now flashing to the sun, Now still as beast in lair. Now round the rock, now mounting o'er, In lawless dance they win their way, Still seeming more and more To swell as we survey. They win their way, and find their rest Together in their ocean home. From East and weary West, From North and South they come. They rush and roar, they whirl and leap, Not wilder drives the wintry storm: Yet a strong law they keep, Strange powers their course inform. Even so the mighty sky-born Stream:— Its living waters from above All marr'd and broken seem, No union and no love. Yet in dim caves they haply blend, In dreams of mortals unespied: One is their awful End, One their unfailing Guide. We that with eye too daring seek To scan their course, all giddy turn:— Not so the floweret meek, Harebell or nodding fern: They from the rocky wall's steep side Lean without fear, and drink the spray; The torrent's foaming pride But keeps them green and gay. And Christ hath lowly hearts, that rest Amid fallen Salem's rush and strife: The pure, peace-loving breast Even here can find her life. What though in harsh and angry note The broken flood chafe high? they muse On mists that lightly float, On heaven-descending dews, On virgin snows, the feeders pure Of the bright river's mountain springs:— And still their prayers endure, And Hope sweet answer brings. If of the Living Cloud they be Baptismal drops, and onward press Toward the Living Sea By deeds of holiness, Then to the Living Waters still (O joy with trembling!) they pertain, Joined by some hidden rill, Low in Earth's darkest vein. Scorn not one drop: of drops the shower Is made, of showers the waterfall: Of children's souls the Power Doomed to be Queen o'er all. 10. THE STARRY HEAVENS. “So shall thy seed be.” “More and more Stars! and ever as I gaze Brighter and brighter seen! Whence come they, Father? trace me out their ways Far in the deep serene.” My child, these eyes of mine but faintly show One step on earth below: And even our wisest may but dream, they say, Of what is done on high, by yon empyreal ray. Thou know'st at deepening twilight, how afar On heath or mountain down The shepherds kindle many an earthly star, How from the low damp town We through the mist the lines of torchlight trace In dwellings proud or base: But whom they light, what deeds and words are there, We know but this alone—'tis well if all be prayer. Whether on lonely shades the pale sad ray From a sick chamber fall, Or amid thousands more beam glad and gay From mirthful bower or hall, If pure the joy, and patient be the woe, Heaven's breath is there, we know: And surely of yon lamps on high we deem As of pure worlds, whereon the floods of mercy stream. Yea, in each keen heart-thrilling glance of theirs Of other stars we read, Stars out of sight, souls for whom Love prepares A portion and a meed In the supernal Heavens for evermore, When sun and moon are o'er; Fixed in the deep of grace and song, as these In the blue skies, and o'er the far-resounding seas. More and more Stars, here in our outward Heaven, More and more Saints above! But to the wistful gaze the sight is given, The vision to meek love,— Love taught of old to treasure and embalm Whate'er in morning calm Or evening soft steals from the gracious skies, The dry ground freshening with the dews of Paradise. All humble holy gleams I bid thee seek, Dim lingering here below; So shall the Almighty give a tongue to speak, A heart to read and know Of Saints at Home, robed and in glory crowned. Dews on the lowly ground May as we downward gaze true token yield, Yea, even in glaring morn, of midnight Heaven's pure field. Stars to the childish eye may gathered seem Into strange shapes and wild, Lion or Eagle, Bear or Harp—such dream As heathen hearts beguiled:— Or as a flock untended, roaming wide Heaven's waste from side to side: But of a central glory sages sing, Whence all may be discerned in clear harmonious ring. Such are Saints' ways—the forms so manifold Our mystic Mother wears, O far unlike our dreamings, young and old!— But Faith still onward fares, Love-guided, heaven-attracted, till she reach The orb whence all and each By golden threads of order and high grace Are pendant evermore, all beauteous, all in place. More and more Stars! behold yon hazy arch Spanning the vault on high, By planets traversed in majestic march, Seeming to earth's dull eye A breath of gleaming air: but take thou wing Of Faith, and upward spring:— Into a thousand stars the misty light Will part; each star a world with its own day and night. Not otherwise of yonder Saintly host Upon the glorious shore Deem thou. He marks them all; not one is lost; By name He counts them o'er. Full many a soul, to man's dim praise unknown, May on its glory-throne As brightly shine, and prove as strong in prayer, As theirs, whose separate beams shoot keenest through this air. My child, even now I see thy tender breath Full quickly come and go At sound of praise. O may the touch of Faith Those chords so fine and low Early controul, and tune thy heart too high For aught beneath the sky. So may that little spark of glory swell To a full orb, and soar with loftiest Saints to dwell. VIII. Lessons of Grace. 1. ISAAC ON MORIAH. “Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship.” Dread was the mystery on Moriah's hill: Low on the ridge the cloud of morning lay: From each dark fold, along each gliding rill, Strange whispers from the mountain met our way. But we must wait below, and upward gaze, While toward the mount the father and the son Pursue their course, soon in that awful haze To vanish, till the appointed deed be done. So when the Lord for some parental heart Prepares a martyr's crown, He calls on high Father and child, in His still shrine apart To learn His lore of healing agony. We may but stay without, and wondering pray; Unknown to us that deep of love and woe, The knife in Abraham's hand upraised to slay, Meek Isaac bound and waiting for the blow. Weak as the echo of some distant knell, Borne now and then on breathing winds of eve, Comes to our ear the sound:—“I see full well The fire and wood; but who the Lamb will give?” Fitful and faint, should Angel bless our dream, The memory now would fleet and now abide. Such to our hearts the stern sweet form may seem Of him who said, “The Almighty will provide.” Not even to dwellers on the mystic height, Not to the Saints, is full enlightening given: The Cross, they hold by, towers beyond their sight, On the hill peak opens a deeper heaven. Yea, though in one were gathered all the woes That mourners e'er on household altars laid, Widows' and orphans' tears, untimely throes, Fears, that the memory of loved souls o'ershade. What were it all, to match one drop of Thine, One bitter drop, poured on Thy mountain here In Thine own hour? O joy! that Blood is mine:— For us it flowed, even as for Saint and seer. Well may we mourn our dull cold heart, and eye That up the mount of glorious sacrifice Sees such a little way: yet kneel we nigh: Turn not away: let prayer in gloom arise. He who beside His own the Cross allows Of penitential grief;—who to each Saint Calls from His height of woe:—His bleeding brows Will meekly droop to hear our breathing faint. 2. SONG OF THE MANNA-GATHERERS. “This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.” Comrades, haste! the tent's tall shading Lies along the level sand Far and faint: the stars are fading O'er the gleaming western strand. Airs of morning Freshen the bleak burning land. Haste, or ere the third hour glowing With its eager thirst prevail O'er the moist pearls, now bestrowing Thymy slope and rushy vale,— Dews celestial, Left when earthly dews exhale. Ere the bright good hour be wasted, Glean, not ravening, nor in sloth: To your tent bring all untasted;— To thy Father, nothing loth, Bring thy treasure: Trust thy God, and keep thy troth. Trust Him: care not for the morrow: Should thine omer overflow, And some poorer seek to borrow, Be thy gift nor scant nor slow. Wouldst thou store it? Ope thine hand, and let it go. Trust His daily work of wonder, Wrought in all His people's sight: Think on yon high place of thunder, Think upon the unearthly light Brought from Sinai, When the prophet's face grew bright. Think, the Glory yet is nigh thee, Power unfelt arrests thine arm, Love aye watching, to deny thee Stores abounding to thy harm. Rich and needy, All are levelled by Love's charm. Sing we thus our songs of labour At our harvest in the wild, For our God and for our neighbour, Till six times the morn have smiled, And our vessels Are with two-fold treasure piled. For that one, that heavenly morrow, We may care and toil to-day: Other thrift is loss and sorrow, Savings are but thrown away. Hoarded manna!— Moths and worms shall on it prey. While the faithless and unstable Mars with work the season blest, We around Thy heaven-sent table Praise Thee, Lord, with all our best. Signs prophetic Fill our week, both toil and rest. Comrades, what our sires have told us— Watch and wait, for it will come: Smiling vales shall soon enfold us In a new and vernal Home: Earth will feed us From her own benignant womb. We beside the wondrous river In the appointed hour shall stand, Following, as from Egypt ever, Thy bright Cloud and outstretched Hand: In Thy shadow We shall rest, on Abraham's land. Not by manna showers at morning Shall our board be then supplied, But a strange pale gold, adorning Many a tufted mountain's side, Yearly feed us, Year by year our murmurings chide. There, no prophet's touch awaiting, From each cool deep cavern start Rills, that since their first creating Ne'er have ceased to sing their part. Oft we hear them In our dreams, with thirsty heart. Oh, when travel-toils are over, When above our tranquil nest All our guardian Angels hover, Will our hearts be quite at rest? Nay, fair Canaan Is not heavenly Mercy's best. Know ye not, our glorious Leader Salem may but see, and die? Israel's guide and nurse and feeder Israel's hope from far must eye, Then departing Find a worthier throne on high. Dimly shall fond Fancy trace him, Dim though sweet her dreams shall prove, Wondering what high Powers embrace him, Where in light he walks above, Where in silence Sleeping, hallows heath or grove. Deeps of blessing are before us: Only, while the desert sky And the sheltering cloud hang o'er us, Morn by morn, obediently, Glean we Manna, And the song of Moses try. 3. THE GIBEONITES. “I will follow upon mine enemies, and overtake them, neither will I turn again till I have destroyed them.” “Behold me, Lord, a worthless Gibeonite, Unmeet to bear one burthen in Thy sight, To hew Thy servants' wood, or water draw, Yet trusted with Thine own eternal Law. The deadlier sure the guilt, the doom more drear, Should Canaan powers prevail—and they are near. The world of Sense, five mighty Monarchs, hard Upon me lies, and I thy robe have marr'd. Chariot and horse they come, a fearful fray:— I cannot stand alone this evil day.”— “Go, shamed and scared, seek Joshua in thy need, Him and all Israel: they for thee shall plead. Their voice hath power to stay the sun, and win The frail fallen mourner time to hate his sin. But when their prayer hath laid the tempter low, Be sure thou crush him: deal out blow on blow: Set thy stern foot upon his neck, and hide His corse, unpitying, in the dark cave's side; Nor venture but in thought to move the stones That guard his place, lest even in those dry bones Some quickening fiend the bold bad life renew, And thou in sevenfold guilt thy heart's backsliding rue.” 4. DAVID'S CHILDHOOD. “I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the Wicked One.” Christian child, whoe'er thou be, Purer oil than David knew, Mingling with baptismal dew, Heaven hath dropped on thee. Strength is given thee, watch to keep O'er the lamb He bought so dear, Thine own soul to watch in fear:— Sleep no faithless sleep. When the Lion and the Bear, Childish Pride and childish Wrath, Lay athwart thy morning path, Thou didst win by prayer. Now a mightier foe is nigh; Holy hands for a new strife Thee have stored with ampler life: Set thine heart on high. Not with sword and shield and lance, But with charm-words from our Book, Gems from our baptismal Brook, Meet his stern advance. He through every gate of sense, Eye and ear, taste, touch, and smell, Fain would hurl the shafts of hell: Seek thou strong defence. Guard in time those portals five With the smooth stones from the Fount, With the Law from God's own Mount: So thy war shall thrive. Keep thy staff, the Cross, in hand: Thou shalt see the giant foe By the word of Faith laid low, O'er him conquering stand. Mark and use the trial-hour: When his whispers nearest sound, Be thou then most faithful found, Then tread down his power. Stripling though thou be, and frail, Thy right arm shall wield his sword, Wield, and take his head abhorred,— Christ in thee prevail. 5. ELIJAH AT SAREPTA. “Make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.” Lo, cast at random on the wild sea sand A child low wailing lies: Around, with eye forlorn and feeble hand, Scarce heeding its faint cries, The widowed mother in the wilderness Gathers dry boughs, their last sad meal to dress. But who is this that comes with mantle rude And vigil-wasted air, Who to the famished cries, “Come give me food, I with thy child would share?” She bounteous gives: but hard he seems of heart, Who of such scanty store would crave a part. Haply the child his little hand holds forth, That all his own may be.— Nay, simple one, thy mother's faith is worth Healing and life to thee. That handful given, for years ensures thee bread: That drop of oil shall raise thee from the dead. For in yon haggard form He begs unseen, To Whom for life we kneel: One little cake He asks with lowly mien, Who blesses every meal. Lavish for Him, ye poor, your children's store, So shall your cruse for many a day run o'er. And thou, dear child, though hungering, give glad way To Jesus in His need: So thy blest mother at the awful day Thy name in Heaven may read; So by His touch for ever mayst thou live, Who asks our alms, and lends a heart to give. 6. NAAMAN'S SERVANT. “Who hath despised the day of small things?” “Who for the like of me will care?” So whispers many a mournful heart, When in the weary languid air For grief or scorn we pine apart. So haply mused yon little maid From Israel's breezy mountains borne, No more to rest in Sabbath shade Watching the free and wavy corn. A captive now, and sold and bought, In the proud Syrian's hall she waits, Forgotten—such her moody thought— Even as the worm beneath the gates. But One who ne'er forgets is here: He hath a word for thee to speak: Oh serve Him yet in duteous fear, And to thy Gentile lord be meek. So shall the healing Name be known By thee on many a heathen shore, And Naaman on his chariot throne Wait humbly by Elisha's door. By thee desponding lepers know The sacred waters' sevenfold might. Then wherefore sink in listless woe? Christ's poor and needy, claim your right! Your heavenly right, to do and bear All for His sake; nor yield one sigh To pining Doubt; nor ask, “What care In the wide world for such as I?” 7. HEZEKIAH'S DISPLAY. “There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.” When Heaven in mercy gives thy prayers return, And Angels bring thee treasures from on high, Shut fast the door, nor let the world discern, And offer thee fond praise when God is nigh. In friendly guise, perchance with friendly heart, From Babel, see, they haste with words of love: But if thou lightly all thy wealth impart, Their race will come again, and all remove. Ill thoughts, the children of that King of Pride, O'er richest halls will swarm, and holiest bowers, Profaning first, then spoiling far and wide:— Voluptuous Sloth make free with Sharon's flowers. Close thou the garden-gate, and keep the key, There chiefly, where the tender seedlings fold Their dainty leaves—a treasure even to thee Unknown, till airs celestial make them bold. When sun and shower give token, freely then The fragrance will steal out, the flower unclose: But busy hands, and an admiring ken, Have blighted ere its hour full many a rose. Then rest thee, bright one, in thy tranquil nook, Fond eyes to cherish thee, true arms to keep, Nor wistful for the world's gay sunshine look;— In its own time the light will o'er thee sweep. Think of the babes of Judah's royal line:— Display but touched them with her parching glare Once, and for ages four they bare the sign, The fifth beheld them chained in Babel's lair. 8. St. JOSEPH. “He called His Name Jesus.” The glorious Sun at morn Draws round him a soft screen, Clear haze, of light and moisture born; So are the bright forms seen, His royal cradle round Standing in meet array, Clouds of all hues, not wholly drowned In dazzling floods of day. Thou temperest, Lord, the rays Which in Thy manger burn, Till Faith in that deep glory-blaze Dim shapes of earth discern: The spotless Mother, first Of creatures: His mild eye,— O favoured!—who her travail nursed, And Thy dread infancy. Him o'er Thee lowly bent, Or meekly waiting nigh, Or on some homely task intent, Yet conscious Who is by, Or on the journey wild, With duteous staff in hand, Guiding the Mother and the Child Across the sea of sand, Thy Church in memory views; Nor can her babes aright On Bethlehem or on Nazareth muse, But he is still in sight. O balm to lonely hearts, Who childless or bereft, Yet round the cradle find their parts, Their place and portion left In bowers of home delight:— Yet may they draw full near, And in the treasure claim their right, Their share of smile and tear, Of thrilling joys and cares.— “Father in God:”—who knows How near it brings us, unawares, To true parental throes? Mightier perchance may prove The lore the Font imparts To strangers, than all yearning love In heathen Mothers' hearts. Whom Jesus Father owned St. Luke ii. 48, 49., Though childless to our eyes, Doubt not, his soul was higher toned To parents' sympathies Than sires on earth may know:— And when His Octave came, He o'er the Lord did first below Speak the Most Holy Name. Wherefore in chorus kind Of household jubilee, Name thou his name with willing mind, Who spake Christ's Name o'er thee. And when at holy tide, Along the Church-way borne Thou seest how babes in triumph ride On arms by rude toil worn;— Or mark'st, how well agree, Both leading and both led, Grey Poverty and childish Glee;— Leave not His lore unread: Then of Saint Joseph think, And of his dread Nurse-Child. Let eyes, that day, from evil shrink, And hearts be undefiled. 9. THE BOY WITH THE FIVE LOAVES. “If thou hast little, do thy diligence gladly to give of that little.” What time the Saviour spread His feast For thousands on the mountain's side, One of the last and least The abundant store supplied. Haply, the wonders to behold, A boy 'mid other boys he came, A lamb of Jesus' fold, Though now unknown by name. Or for his sweet obedient ways The Apostles brought him near, to share Their Lord's laborious days, His frugal basket bear. Or might it be his duteous heart, That led him sacrifice to bring For his own simple part, To the world's hidden King? Well may I guess how glow'd his cheek, How he look'd down, half pride, half fear: Far off he saw one speak Of him in Jesus' ear. “There is a lad—five loaves hath he, And fishes twain:—but what are they, Where hungry thousands be?”— Nay, Christ will find a way. In order, on the fresh green hill, The mighty Shepherd ranks His Sheep By tens and fifties, still As clouds when breezes sleep. Oh who can tell the trembling joy, Who paint the grave endearing look, When from that favoured boy The wondrous pledge He took?— Keep thou, dear child, thine early word; Bring Him thy best: who knows but He For His eternal board May take some gift of thee? Thou prayest without the veil as yet; But kneel in faith: an arm benign Such prayer will duly set Within the holiest shrine. And Prayer has might to spread and grow. Thy childish darts, right-aim'd on high, May catch Heaven's fire, and glow Far in the eternal sky: Even as He made that stripling's store Type of the Feast by Him decreed, Where Angels might adore, And souls for ever feed. 10. THE MOURNERS FOLLOWING THE CROSS. “Weep not for Me, but for yourselves, and for your children. There is no grief that ever wasted man, But finds its hour here in Thine awful week: And since all Mother's love from Thee began, Sure none, like Thee, of Mother's woe can speak. Thine ear prophetic, Lord, while angels wreak The vengeance on Thine heritage defil'd, While temples crash, and towers in ashes reek, And with each gust some kingdom strews the wild, Loses no lowly moan, no sigh of sobbing child. Even so might seamen's wives at midnight drear Lie listening to the blast, and tell aright The tale of all the waves, that far and near Break on the reef, yet miss no wailing slight Of nestling babe, for wonder or delight Uttering faint cries in sleep.—O restless care! Oh all foreseeing pity!—be our flight In winter, soothing spells will He prepare, And for His lambs allay the bleak heart-killing air. Or if the Holy Day the few brief hours Of flight abridge, for nursing-mother frail, For tender babe, Thou send'st Thine unseen powers To help or hide:—hide in the lowly vale, Help o'er the weary mountain.—Ne'er may fail The prayer of helpless Faith;—but she must pray, Her forceful knocking must Heaven's door assail: For so of old He taught: “Pray that your way Be not in winter wild, nor on the Sabbath Day.” The season He bids choose, who in strong hand Winter and summer holds, and day and night, Binding His sovereign will in Love's soft band;— As parents teach their little ones to write With gently-guiding finger, and delight The wish and prayer to mould, then grant the boon:— Such is Thy silent grace, framing aright Our lowly orisons in time and tune To Litanies on high, controlling sun and moon. And as the heart maternal evermore Must rise in prayer, so the maternal feet Must feel their dim way on the lonely shore, Ere o'er the path the unpitying surges beat. At early dawn, the fresh spring dews to greet, I bid thee haste, else vainly wilt thou crave An hour in winter. Fast the week-days fleet, Slow speeds the work: the lingerers who shall save? Thy task ere Sunday end, thy life before the grave. Who may the horror but in dream abide, Breathless to knock, and by the portal wait Where Saints have past behind their glorious Guide, Then feel, not hear, the sad drear word, “Too late?” Woe, in that hour, to souls that seek the gate Alone! but deeper anguish, direr gloom, If to thy bosom clinging, child or mate, Pupil or friend, the heaven-prepared room, Tardy through thee, should miss, and share the hopeless doom! 11. St. ANDREW AND HIS CROSS. “Where I am, there shall also My servant be.” O Holy Cross, on thee to hang At Jesus' side, and feel thee sweet, And taste aright each healing pang, What Saint, what Virgin Martyr e'er was meet? Two only of His own found grace The very death He died to die. Joyful they rush'd to thine embrace, While Angel choirs, half envying, waited by. Joyful they speed:—but how is this? Why doubt they yet, in Jesus' power To grasp their crown of hard won bliss? Well have ye fought; why faint in Victory's hour? Two brothers' hearts were they, the first Who shone as stars in Jesus' Hand, For thee in Prayer and Fasting nurs'd, And bearing thee, dread Cross! from land to land. And now in wondrous sympathy, When thou art nearer fain to draw, These who had yearn'd so long for thee Shrink from thy touch, and hide their eyes for awe. He who denied—he dares not scale With forward step thy holy stair. Best for his giddy heart and frail In humblest penance to hang downward there. And he, that saintly Elder meek, Wont of old time to find and bring Brother or friend with Christ to speak, As worthier to behold the heart-searching King:— Ah little brook'd his lowly heart, Such glorious crown should him reward. He sought the way with duteous art To change his Cross, yet suffer with his Lord. He sought and found: and now where'er Saint Andrew's holy Cross we see, In royal banner blazon'd fair, Or in dread Cipher, Holiest Name, of thee, A martyr'd form we may discern, There bound, there preaching: Image meet Of One uplifted high, to turn And draw to Him all hearts in bondage sweet. And as we gaze may He impart The grace to bear what He shall send, Yet stay the rash self-pleasing heart, Too forward with His Cross our penal woe to blend. IX. Holy Places and Things. 1. PREPARING FOR SUNDAY SERVICES. “As they went to tell His Disciples, Jesus met them saying, ‘All hail.’” Behold, athwart our woodland nest, And down our misty vale, From his own bright and quiet rest The Sunday sun looks out, and seems to say, “All hail.” True token of that brighter Day, Which hailed, this matin hour, The holy women on their way. They sought His Church in love, He met them in His power. And dare we the transporting word To our own hearts apply? Trembling we dare; for He had heard Our lowly breathed vows, ere flamed yon morning sky. We have been by His Cross and grave; His Angel bade us speed Where they resort, whom He will save, And hear and say as one, “The Lord is risen indeed.” Then speed we on our willing way, And He our way will bless. In fear and love thy heart array: Straight be thy churchway path, unsoiled thy Sabbath dress. 2. WALK TO CHURCH. “The path of the Just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.” Now the holy hour is nigh, Seek we out the holy ground; Overhead the breezy sky, Rustling woodlands all around: Fragrant steams from oak-leaves sere, Peat and moss and whortles green, Dews that yet are glistening clear Through their brown or briery screen. Hie we through the autumnal wood, Pausing where the echoes dwell, Boys, or men of boyish mood, Trying how afar they swell. Haply down some opening glade Now the old grey tower we see, Underneath whose solemn shade Jesus risen hath sworn to be. He hath sworn, for there will meet Two or three in His great name, Waiting till their incense sweet Feel His heaven-descended flame. Day by day that old grey tower Tells its tale, and week by week In their tranquil hoary bower To the unlearned its shadows speak. 3. THE LICH-GATE. “Keep thy foot when thou goest to the House of God.” This is the portal of the dead.— Nay, shrink not so, my fair-eyed boy, But on the threshold grating tread With wary softness: tame the joy, The wildfire keen, that all the way Even from our porch at home hath danced with thee so gay. This is the holy resting-place, Where coffins and where mourners wait, Till the stoled priest hath time to pace His path toward this eastern gate, Like one who bears a hidden seal Of pardon from a king, where rebels trembling kneel. Brief is the pause, but thoughts and dreams By thousands on that moment crowd, Of clouds departing, opening gleams, A waning lamp, a brightening shroud: Such visions fill the longing eyes As haply haunt the space 'twixt earth and Paradise. Such visions in the churchyard air Are gleaming, fluttering all around. O scare them not away: beware Of bolder cry and ruder bound. Thick as the bees that love to play Under the lime-tree leaves the livelong summer day, And tunable as their soft song, And fragrant as the honey'd flowers They haunt and cherish, is the throng Of thoughts in these our hallowed bowers. On every gale that stirs the yew They float, and twinkle in each drop of morning dew. Oh then revere each old grey stone, And gently tread the mounds between. So when thy blithesome days are done, And thou, as I, shalt wearied lean Upon the wicket low, and tell Thy tale of playmates called before thee here to dwell;— When thou shalt mark, how swarms the street With boys at play, the turf with graves, All in one little hour to meet And hear the doom that slays or saves;— Fresh may the memory prove and dear, How thou hast come and gone, since first we brought thee here. Then shall the wings, so strong in need, Which met thee at the Font that hour, And homeward joy'd with thee to speed, O'ershade thee still in love and power, And with the churchyard shadows blend, Which thy last entering here shall in sweet peace attend. 4. OBEISANCE AT ENTERING CHURCH. “They shall see His face; and His Name shall be in their foreheads.” Come hear with duteous mind Thy Mother's whisper'd word. “Wouldst thou upon His threshold find Thy dread and loving Lord? Renew in silence on thy brow The pledge of thy first saving vow.” Safe in thy forehead keep The mark by Jesus set. Before thee is a mighty deep, A baptism waits thee yet: As Lazarus rising, such thou art, Thy soul and flesh again to part. But when thy Lord and thou,— Thou from the grave, and He From Heaven,—shall meet, upon thy brow A glorious Cross shall be, A Light that needs no watching o'er, Even as He rose, and died no more. 5. THE EMPTY CHURCH. “The blind and the lame came to Him in the temple.” Why should we grudge the hour and house of prayer To Christ's own blind and lame, Who come to meet Him there? Better, be sure, His altar-flame Should glow in one dim wavering spark, Than quite lie down, and leave His temple drear and dark. “But in our Psalm their choral answers fail.”— Nay, but the heart may speak, And to the holy tale Respond aright in silence meek. And well we know, bright angel throngs Are by, to swell those whisperings into warbled songs. What if the world our two or three despise? They in His name are here, To Whom in suppliant guise Of old the blind and lame drew near. Beside His royal courts they wait And ask His healing Hand: we dare not close the gate. 6. CHURCH DECORATIONS. “I will not offer burnt-offerings without cost.” “Why deck the high cathedral roof With foliage rich and rare, With crowns and flowerets far aloof, To none but Angels fair? “Why for the lofty Altar hide Thy gems and gold in store? Why spread the burnished pall so wide Upon the chancel floor?” Nay, rather ask, why duteous boy And mother-loving maid Scarce in their filial gifts find joy, If nought of theirs be paid: Why hearts, that true love-tokens need For brother or for friend, Count not the cost with careful heed, But haste their all to spend. Ask why of old the favoured king Enquired the Temple's price, Not bearing to his Lord to bring An unbought sacrifice. Yea, lowly fall, and of thy Lord In silence ask and dread, Why praised He Mary's ointment, poured Upon His Sacred Head. 7. CHURCH WINDOWS. “The Lord my God shall come, and all the Saints with Thee. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark.” Oft have I heard our elders say, How sad the autumnal hour, How rude the touch of stern decay, How fast the bright hues melt away In mountain, sky, and bower! Yet is it dear delight to me The rustling leaves to tread, To heap and toss them wild and free, Their fragrance breathe, and o'er them see Soft evening lustre shed. And some will say, 'tis drear and cold In holy Church to kneel With one or two, Christ's little fold, With blind and lame, with poor and old, There met for Him to heal. Nay, look again: the Saints are there: Christ's ever-glowing Light Through heavenly features grave and fair Is gleaming; all the lonely air Is thronged with shadows bright. The Saints are there:—the Living Dead, The Mourners glad and strong; The sacred floor their quiet bed, Their beams from every window shed, Their voice in every song. And haply where I kneel, some day, From yonder gorgeous pane The glory of some Saint will play:— Not lightly may it pass away, But in my heart remain! 8. RELICS AND MEMORIALS. “As the shadow of a great Rock in a weary land.” The Twelve holy men are gathered in prayer, The Psalm mounts on high, the Spirit descends: A keen silent thrilling is round them in air, A Power from the Highest with thought and word blends. They pass by the way, to sight poor and mean. How glorious the train that streams to and fro! The blind, dumb, halt, withered, by hundreds are seen, The prisoners of Satan lie chained where they go. O lay them but where the shadow may fall Of Christ's awful Saint, to prayer as he speeds: The mighty love-token all fiends shall appal, A gale breathe from Eden, assuaging all needs. Or bring where they lie Paul's girdle or vest: One touch and one word:—the pain fleets away, The dark hour of frenzy is charmed into rest: The hem of Christ's garment all creatures obey. Christ is in His Saints: from Godhead made Man The virtue goes out, the whole world to bless. O'er lands parched and weary that shadow began To spread from Saint Peter, and ne'er shall grow less. See Acts iv. and v. 9. CARVED ANGELS. “Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones: for I say unto you, That in Heaven their angels do always behold the Face of My Father.” Greatest art Thou in least, O Lord, And even thy least are great in Thee: A mote in air, a random word, Shall save a soul if Thou decree:— Much more their presence sweet, Whom with an oath Thou didst into thy Kingdom greet. A little child's soft sleeping face The murderer's knife ere now hath staid: The adulterous eye, so foul and base, Is of a little child afraid. They cannot choose but fear, Since in that sign they feel God and good Angels near. For by the Truth's sure oath we know, There is no christened babe but owns A Watcher mightier than his foe, One of the everlasting Thrones, Who in high Heaven His face Beholding ever, best His likeness here may trace. As in each tiny drop of dew, Glistening at prime of morn, they mark Of Heaven's great Sun an image true, Hear their own chantings in the Lark, So, sleeping or awake, They love to tend their babes for holy Bethlehem's sake. And so this whole fallen world of ours, To us all care, and sin, and spite, Is even as Eden's stainless bowers To the pure spirits out of sight,— To Angels from above, And souls of infants, sealed by new-creating Love. Heaven in the depth and height is seen; On high among the stars, and low In deep clear waters: all between Is earth, and tastes of earth: even so The Almighty One draws near To strongest seraphs there, to weakest infants here. And both are robed in white, and both On evil look unharmed, and wear A ray so pure, ill Powers are loth To linger in the keen bright air. As Angels wait in joy On Saints, so on the old the duteous-hearted boy. God's Angels keep the eternal round Of praise on high, and never tire. His lambs are in His Temple found Early, with all their hearts' desire. They boast not to be free, They grudge not to their Lord meek ear and bended knee. O well and wisely wrought of old, Nor without guide be sure, who first Did cherub forms as infants mould, And lift them where the full deep burst Of awful harmony Might need them most, to waft it onward to the sky:— Where best they may in watch and ward Around the enthroned Saviour stand, May quell, with sad and stern regard, Unruly eye and wayward hand, May deal the blessed dole Of saving knowledge round from many a holy scroll. What if in other lines than ours They write, in other accents speak? There are whom watchful Love empowers To read such riddles; duteous seek, And thou shalt quickly find. The Mother best may tell the eager babe's deep mind. Haply some shield their arms embrace, Rich with the Lord's own blazonry. The Cross of His redeeming grace, Or His dread Wounds, we there descry. His standard-bearers they: Learn we to face them on the dread Procession Day. And O! if aught of pride or lust Have soiled thee in the world, take heed: Entering, shake off the mire and dust. Angelic eyes are keen, to read By the least lightest sign, When we foul idle thoughts breathe in the air divine. And how, but by their whisperings soft, Feel virgin hearts when sin is near, Sin even in dreams unknown? Full oft Such instinct we may mark in fear, Nor our own ill endure In presence of Christ's babes, and of their Guardians pure. 10. CHURCH RITES. “Christ is all, and in all.” The wedding guests are met, The urns are duly set, Even as the Lord had taught his own of old. Filled are they to the height With water puro and bright:— Now pour them out—'tis done, and purest wine behold. The bridegroom kneels beside His bashful loving bride; Earth on that hour seems showering all her best. But more than Earth e'er knew He wins, if hearts be true:— An Angel friend, to share his everlasting rest. A babe in deep repose Where holy water flows Is bathed, while o'er him holiest words are said. A child of wrath he came— Now hath he Jesus' Name: A glory like a Saint's surrounds his favoured head. A mortal youth I saw Nigh to God's Altar draw And lowly kneel, while o'er him pastoral hands Were spread with many a prayer And when he rose up there, He could undo or bind the dread celestial bands. When Bread and Wine he takes, And of Christ's Passion makes Memorial high before the Mercy Throne, Faith speaks, and we are sure That offering good and pure Is more than Angels' bread to all whom Christ will own. Mid mourners I have stood, And with sad eye pursued The coffin sinking in the grave's dark shade: The immortal life, we know, Dwells there with hidden glow, Brightly to burn one day when sun and stars shall fade. What is this silent might, Making our darkness light, New wine our waters, heavenly Blood our wine? Christ, with His Mother dear, And all His Saints, is here, And where they dwell is Heaven, and what they touch, divine. The change of water into wine was believed by the ancients to typify that change which St. Paul in particular so earnestly dwells on: “Old things are passed away. behold, all things are become new.” And St. John, “He that sitteth on the Throne saith, Behold, I make all things new.” Accordingly St. Cyprian applies this first miracle to the admission of the Gentiles into the Church. (Ep. 63. ed. Fell.) And St. Augustine, to the evangelical interpretation of the Old Testament. (In Joan. Tract. 8.) And St. Cyril of Alexandria (in loc.) to the Spirit superseding the letter. This then being the “beginning of miracles,” a kind of pattern of the rest, showed how Christ's glory was to be revealed in the effects of His Sacramental Touch; whether immediately, as when He touched the leper and healed him: or through the hem of His garment: or by Saints. His living members, according to His Promise, “The works that I do shall ye do also: and greater works than these shall ye do, because I go unto my Father.” Thus, according to the Scriptures, the Sacramental Touch of the Church is the Touch of Christ: and her system is “deifica disciplina,” a rule which, in some sense, makes men gods, and the human, divine; and all this depends on the verity of the Incarnation, therefore His Mother is especially instrumental in it; besides being, as nearest to Him, the most glorious instance of it. “The Mother of Jesus is there, and both Jesus and His Disciples are called,—” (He as the Bridegroom and Author of the whole mystery, they as ministers, servants, and instruments,)—to this mysterious “marriage,” or Communion of Saints. 11. WHITE APPAREL. I. The Chrisom. “These are they which have washed their robes, and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb.” All gorgeous hues are in the pure white beam, All Christian graces in one drop of Love That sparkles from the bright baptismal stream Over the fair young brow, where gently move Christ's dawning rays. Therefore the veil ye wove, Good Angels, under Bethlehem's healing star, Whose virtue this our new-born joy shall prove, Is spotless white: and from its folds afar, Even as from banner waved in Angels' war, The dark Powers flee. But thou, heaven honoured child, Let no earth-stain thy robe of glory mar: Wrap it around thy bosom undefiled; Yet spread it daily in the clear Heaven's sight, To be new-bathed in its own native Light. II. The Sunday Dress. “Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments.” So keep thou, by calm prayer and searching thought, Thy Chrisom pure, that still as weeks roll by, And Heaven rekindles, gladdening earth and sky, The glow that from the grave our Champion brought, Pledge of high victory by His dread Wounds wrought, Thou mayst put on the garb of Purity, And from thy prayer look up with open eye, Him owning, who from shame and sinful blot Hath kept thee safe, nor suffered base desire Thy soul to haunt, unhallowing the good hour. Then on thy way to church rejoicing fare, Yet heedful, gathering up from earthly mire The glittering folds: for even in Sunday air Foul spirits love to lurk with tainting power. III. Confirmation. “Ye shall be as the wings of a Dove, that is covered with silver.” Speed on, ye happy Sunday hours, O speed The moment when a richer gift shall crown A riper faith: when Childhood, casting down Her innocent vesture, the pure Chrisom weed, Shall claim the sevenfold radiance, erst decreed Where true hearts kneel 'neath Apostolic hands. White are his mantle folds, who ready stands Before the shrine, to bless and intercede: And duteous maidens, skilful in Love's law, Unbidden use in stainless white to come: As doves, that to the bright clouds upward draw, Plume the soft lily breast, the more to win Of splendour from the Light's far cloudless home. O deep, that hour, the bliss or curse within! IV. Priests in White. “When they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments.” And even the very walls of the dread place, And the tall windows with their breathing lights, Speak to the adoring heart, and say, No base Or week-day garb may him beseem, who writes God's message here in hearts of men,—invites To the bright nuptial feast of joy and grace. But Angels waiting on our awful rites Should in our frail and mortal Angel trace Some hue of their own robes, what time they raise The censer, heaped with prayer, before the throne: And Innocents, in wonder moved to gaze On the new glory, mantling forms well-known, Should ask and learn the clue to Angels' ways:— “The vision is for the pure heart alone.” V. Choristers in White. “The Levites which were the singers,...with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white linen.” Within a reverend Minster I have stood, As one to whom, for many a godless deed, The Choir was clos'd: fit penance and due meed Sad conscience own'd it:—one by one I view'd With wistful eye the entering multitude. At last with joyous step, but sober heed Of holy things, like fawns in forest mead, Timid yet happy, the white-robed brood Of Choristers swept by:—then musings came, “What happier dawn of being than to meet Matins and vespers here with punctual feet? What happier close, than here in peace to lay, Wearing the white robe still, th' exhausted frame, And so, through life, Heaven's garb and speech assay?” VI. Bridal White. “And unto her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white.” Once more unto thine Altar, Lord, once more, In vesture of thy Saints: for Joy and Love Have vow'd, to day, their best on earth to prove, And Pureness, guardian sole of their rich store Of blessing and delight. Arm we the more Both heart and limb with brightness from above: So may we scare the noisome beasts that rove There busiest, where Earth's rapture most runs o'er. Well are they warn'd, who in that dangerous bliss May on some Innocent look down, array'd In bridal white, flower of the nuptial band, Unconscious, yet o'erjoy'd: nor far amiss Deem they perchance, who in that smiling maid Heaven's youngest Angel see, with wreath in hand. VII. Penitents in White. “Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him.” But what if chrisom robes be sin-defil'd, If nuptial white of broken vows bear trace, If he who daily in the holy Place Wears the bright albe, in heart be gross and wild, So that the stones, whereon the shrine is pil'd, Seem to cry out, “Who hath requir'd this grace Of thee, the consecrated floor to pace, Thrice pledg'd and thrice forsworn?” O Saviour mild, Hast Thou, for these, a white robe yet in store? Yea: the Church path is by the fount of tears, And a grave Angel stands beside the door, Laden with vests for contrite pilgrims meet. Him trust with all; sad memories and dim fears: Then kneel in white before the Mercy-seat. VIII. White upon the Altar. “He bought fine linen, and took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen.” O Lord, give gracious humbleness of heart, And chaste and grave imaginings, in awe Veiled evermore, that as we nearer draw To thy tremendous Altar, or impart Unto thy little ones the skill and art Of holy things, and the mysterious law Whereby Faith sees whate'er Apostles saw, No ill may glance or eye or mind athwart. So unreproved may we to babes declare The secret of the Altar's snow-white pall, And of the linen garment, bright and fair, Spread o'er the glorious Sacrifice when all Have tasted. 'Tis as Jesus' winding sheet, And theirs, who die clasping His sacred Feet. IX. The Winding Sheet. “Not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon.” Pure is the glory of the Chrisom vest; Joyous the Sunday-robe; all hope and might The heavenly gleam, when dovelike wings alight On the twice-sealed brow; benignly rest The smiles of Angels on the mitred crest And flowing skirt of Priests, whose stainless white The heart belies not; or on striplings bright, Glancing like spirits through the region blest; Or on glad bridal train, around the shrine Gathered with starlike and unchanging gleam; But most where dimly robes of penance shine. Yet all is vain, if the last glory fail, If with the cold pale shroud the Font's pure beam Blend not, and o'er all hues of death prevail. 12. RED-BREAST IN CHURCH. “The creature itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.” What is this sudden thrill Of notes so sweet and keen? The organ's waves of sound are still Within the awful screen. In prayer are bowed both head and knee, And yet unbidden rings and free A chant from one unseen. A winged chorister From his arched nook on high Makes in the calm a gladsome stir, His proper melody: A Red-breast blithe, his evening hymn Trying amid the shadows dim, Attracts both ear and eye. Nor time nor tune are there, Yet sounds the unruly joy Meet for the hour, nor spoils the prayer Even of the gazing boy. It seems to say, Not man alone Lives in the shade of Jesus' Throne, And shares the Saints' employ. The Angels out of sight Worship with us, we know; And who can say what pure warm light The unreasoning tribes below May by their kindly wafting feel? What gleams to guide, what balms to heal From Christ on earth may flow? Bird, beast, and insect hail Warm sun and fragrant shower. The sheep in Bethlehem's thymy dale, In Blessed Mary's bower The ox and ass—to them was given To see our Lord: the Light of Heaven Fell on them in that hour. And since our Lord she bare In triumph to His place, One patient beast hath seemed to wear The mark of His high grace, His tokens to dumb creatures, freed From slavery and unholy deed, From cruel tasks and base:— Freed by the mighty Cross, And pure.—O mark it, all Who bear that sign! O fear and loss, Should ye again enthrall To woe and wrong His creatures, sealed For blessing, aid to earn and yield, As ere our father's fall! 13. DISUSE OF EXCOMMUNICATION. “Having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.” O wondrous warfare of the Spouse of God, Trampled to earth, yet wielding bolts so keen, She dares not hurl them in her wrath abroad, Only their ireful lustre glares half-seen. For if she once unlock her quivered store, Once speak the words that in her bosom dwell, Earth could not bear the sound; the anguish sore Might drive her haughtiest to the scourge and cell. For she hath power to shut the Heaven on high, Oft as in hallowed air her dread notes thrill, That no shower fall: and she may smite and try Earth with all plagues, as often as she will. Only her potent arm now for a space Lies withered: quenched and dull her arrowy fires, Like smouldering brands in daylight, till her race Wake, as of old, to heaven-born high desires. But would one Church Christ's awful lore obey, Like Saints of old,—one household, one true heart, Such sacrifice might open the dread way For the Old Signs, for Paul's or Moses' art. Darkness, and mist, at one stern word of thine, Might even on scorners' outward eyes descend; Fire might break out of each insulted shrine, Thy locusts spoil them, and thy lions rend. Haunt us, dire thought! where'er we walk in sin That mighty secret Power is all our foe: But they who bear unharm'd Heaven's seal within May through the penal fires rejoicing go. So when the storm is rife among the hills, Roused on his heathery bed the mountain boy To every flash that through the dim air thrills Keeps time with eager hands, and screams for joy. Note from the Life of Sir Walter Scott, i. 83. “There is a story of his having been forgotten one day among the knolls when a thunderstorm came on; and his aunt, suddenly recollecting his situation, and running out to bring him home, is said to have found him lying on his back, clapping his hands at the lightning, and crying out, ‘Bonny, bonny’ at every flash.” 14. DISUSE OF INFANT COMMUNION. “There shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.” O Lord, behold these babes are Thine, Thy treasured nurslings pure and sweet: We have sought counsel at Thy shrine: “Where may they sit with Thee, and eat?” Thou saidst, “The Water-Bearer meet Within the chosen City's round, Trace Him along the hallowed street, And where He guides, be duteous found. “Where glorious Sion rests on high Amid the hills that on her wait, Him faithful following, ye shall spy A wicket in a lowly gate: There early knock, there linger late, There in Christ's Name the room require, Where the Great Lord in royal state Shall eat the Bread of His desire. “Then to the spacious upper room The Host will bid you onward fare, Round many a nook of deepest gloom, Up many a broken wearying stair. The handmaid Penance hath been there, And swept and garnished all the place, Haste, and with loyal hands prepare For Me and Mine the Feast of Grace.” Thou spak'st, and we Thine infants bore, And bathed them in the Living Well That gushes out beside the door, Where Thou, O Lord, delight'st to dwell: Then lowly on our knees we fell, And prayed, that through the world's hot day Dews from that hour, a balmy spell, Might gently freshen all their way. Now, trembling still as they advance Up the far shadowing awful nave, Full oft we bid them backward glance Where gleaming from its heavenly cave,— The Saviour's side,—the healing wave Falls in the fount of their new birth. The ears that hear its murmuring, crave No tinsel melodies of earth. When to the Chancel arch they come, “Pause here,” we say, “and search with fear If yet the pledge of your high doom Upon the sealed brow appear. If worn and faint, by many a tear Renew the lines, then humbly kneel Till He invite—till sure and near The gliding of soft wings ye feel. “Then to the inner shrine make haste, Fall prostrate with anointed brows, Adore, and of the Adored taste. Such bliss the Love untold allows.” Of old, we read, the intrusted Spouse Her infants to the Anointing led Straight from the Laver and the vows:— Yea, Christ was then the children's bread. But now some mournful instinct chills Our Mother's joy, and mars our spring: She, as of old, to the bright hills Her eaglets' speed at once would wing: Now far and wide earth's vapours fling Their tainting dews; and she perchance Shrinks from the fall such flight may bring, Fears the debasing, downward glance. Then in low place with lowly heart Wait we, dear babe, both thou and I, Bide we our time, and take such part In the Bride's awful minstrelsy, As she whose laws are sealed on high Ordains: and if long lingering tire, Yet may we hope, Faith's virgin sigh The purer mounts, to meet Heaven's fire. 15. THE OFFERTORY. “God loveth a cheerful giver.” Christ before thy door is waiting; Rouse thee, slave of earthly gold. Lo, He comes, thy pomp abating, Hungry, thirsty, homeless, cold:— Hungry, by Whom Saints are fed With the Eternal Living Bread; Thirsty, from Whose pierced side Healing waters springs and glide; Cold and bare He comes, Who never May put off His robe of light; Homeless, Who must dwell for ever In the Father's Bosom bright. In kind ambush alway lying He besets thy bed and path, Fain would see thee hourly buying Prayers against the time of wrath, Prayers of thankful mourners here, Prayers that in Love's might appear With the offerings of the Blest, At the shrine of perfect rest. See, His undecaying treasure Lies like dew upon the grass, To be won and stored at pleasure:— But its hour will quickly pass. Christ before His Altar standing, Priest of Priests, in His own Day, Calls on thee, some fruit demanding Of the week's heaven-guarded way. See His Arm stretch'd out to bless: Whoso nearest to Him press, Open-handed, eagle-eyed, They may best that arm abide, When, the last dread lightnings wielding, He shall lift it, and decree, “Go, ye churls of soul unyielding, Where nor gift nor prayer shall be.” Jesus in His babes abiding Shames our cold ungentle ways, Silently the young heart guiding To unconscious love and praise. See out-reached the fingers small, Ever, at each playful call, Ready to dispense around Joys and treasures newly found. Fearless they of waste or spoiling Nought enjoy but what they share; Grudging thought and care and moiling Live not in their pure glad air. Strange the law of Love's combining!— As with wild winds moaning round Tones from lute or harp entwining Make one thread of solemn sound;— As calm eve's autumnal glow Answers to the woods below:— As in landscape leaf or stone, Cloud or flower, at random thrown, Helps the sadness or the glory;— So the gift of playful child May recall thy natal story, Church of Salem undefiled! How the new-born Saints, assembling Daily 'neath the shower of fire, To their Lord in hope and trembling Brought the choice of earth's desire. Never incense-cloud so sweet As before the Apostles' feet Rose, majestic Seer, from thee, Type of royal hearts and free, Son of holiest consolation, When thou turn'dst thy land to gold, And thy gold to strong salvation, Leaving all, by Christ to hold:— Type of Priest and Monarch, casting All their crowns before the Throne, And the treasure everlasting Heaping in the world unknown. Now in gems their relics lie, And their names in blazonry, And their forms from storied panes Gleam athwart their own lov'd fanes, Each his several radiance flinging On the sacred Altar floor, Whether great ones much are bringing, Or their mite the mean and poor. Bring thine all, thy choicest treasure, Heap it high and hide it deep: Thou shalt win o'erflowing measure, Thou shalt climb where skies are steep. For as Heaven's true only light Quickens all those forms so bright, So where Bounty never faints, There the Lord is with His Saints, Mercy's sweet contagion spreading Far and wide from heart to heart, From His Wounds atonement shedding On the blessed widow's part. 16. CHURCH BELLS. “Let the hills hear thy voice.” “Wake me to-night, my mother dear, That I may hear The Christmas Bells, so soft and clear, To high and low glad tidings tell, How God the Father loved us well, How God the Eternal Son Came to undo what we had done, How God the Paraclete, Who in the chaste womb framed the Babe so sweet, In power and glory came, the birth to aid and greet. “Wake me, that I the twelvemonth long May bear the song About with me in the world's throng; That treasured joys of Christmas tide May with mine hour of gloom abide; The Christmas carol ring Deep in my heart, when I would sing; Each of the twelve good days Its earnest yield of duteous love and praise, Ensuring happy months, and hallowing common ways. “Wake me again, my mother dear, That I may hear The peal of the departing year. O well I love, the step of Time Should move to that familiar chime: Fair fall the tones that steep The Old Year in the dews of sleep, The New guide softly in With hopes to sweet sad memories akin! Long may that soothing cadence ear, heart, conscience win.” In the dark winter, ere the snow Had lost its glow, This melody we learned; and lo! We hear it now in every breeze That stirs on high the summer trees. We pause and look around— Where may the lone church-tower be found, That speaks our tongue so well? The dim peal in the torrent seems to dwell, It greets us from afar in Ocean's measured swell. Perhaps we sit at home, and dream On some high theme, And forms, that in low embers gleam, Come to our twilight Fancy's aid: Then, wavering as that light and shade, The breeze will sigh and wail, And up and down its plaintive scale Range fitfully, and bear Meet burden to the lowly whispered air, And ever the sweet bells, that charmed Life's morn, are there. The pine-logs on the hearth sometimes Mimic the chimes, The while on high the white wreath climbs, Which seething waters upward fling, In prison wont to dance and sing, All to the same low tune. But most it loves in bowers of June At will to come and go, Where like a minster roof the arched boughs show And court the pensive ear of loiterer far below. Be mine at Vesper hour to stray Full oft that way, And when the dreamy sounds decay, As with the sun the gale dies down, Then far away, from tower or town, A true peal let me hear, In manifold melodious cheer, Through all the lonely grove Wafting a fair good-night from His high love, Who strews our world with signs from His own world above. So never with regretful eye Need we descry Dark mountains in the evening sky, Nor on those ears with envy think, Which nightly from the cataract shrink In heart-ennobling fear, And in the rushing whirlwind hear (When from his Highland cave He sweeps unchained over the wintry wave) Ever the same deep chords, such as home fancies crave. Ever the same, yet ever new, Changed and yet true, Like the pure heaven's unfailing blue, Which varies on from hour to hour, Yet of the same high Love and Power Tells alway:—such may seem Through life, or waking or in dream, The echoing Bells that gave Our childhood welcome to the healing wave: Such the remembered Word, so mighty then to save. 17. CONTINUAL SERVICES. (For the Sunday before Advent.) “Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.” O endless round of Nature's wheel, How doth thine untired course reveal The universal spring Of Power and Motion! Not in keen And sudden startings, far between “Continuo, non vero per saltum.” Newton., But smooth as sea-bird's wing, Gliding unwearied, now in Air And now in Ocean, As though Life's only call and care Were graceful motion. Such are your changes, Space and Time, Dying away in softest chime, With gentlest intervals Aye lessening on the ear, and felt As when into each other melt The hues where evening falls. Thus moon to moon gives silent place, And bright stars waning Gradual retire, while morn's still pace On night is gaining. Thus or for increase or decay The seasons wind their viewless way, Nor but by word of man Or measure rude by man imposed, Is known when day or year hath closed, Summer or Winter's span. And ever onward as we go, The wide earth rounding, The horizon moves in gentle flow, Not in harsh bounding. For why? the unseen Preserver's law Is nigh, to master and o'erawe The creatures in their race, Else starting each its own wild way. So Nature, saved from disarray, Is free to wait on Grace: And still, as Earth and Time steal on To their dread ending, New fragments may of both be won For holy spending. Thus high may soar the instructed soul, Watching young fingers idly roll The mimic earth, or trace The picture bright of blue and gold The orbs that round the sky's deep fold Each other circling chase. When plainest strikes the inward ear What Heaven hath spoken, Then most for our own chant we fear, So harsh and broken. His spheres, recede they or advance, Before Him in mysterious dance Keep tune and time; nor e'er Fails from this lower world a wreath Of incense, such as sweet flowers breathe, And vernal breezes bear. Only man's frail sin-wearied heart Bears, half in sadness, A wavering, intermitted part In that high gladness.— Yes: so it was ere Jesus came. Alternate then His altar-flame Blazed up and died away; And Silence took her turn with Song, And Solitude with the fair throng That owned the festal day. For in earth's daily circuit then One only border Reflected to the Seraph's ken Heaven's light and order. But now to the revolving sphere We point, and say, No desert here, No waste so dark and lone, But to the hour of sacrifice Comes daily in its turn, and lies In light beneath the Throne. Each point of time, from morn to eve, From eve to morning, The shrine doth from the Spouse receive Praise and adorning. While on our couch we listless dream, Or drink perforce of care's dull stream Yet somewhere in that hour The holy words are uttered, Earth Is partner made in Angels' mirth, The unspeakable, pure shower Of blessings to the unbloody rite Even now is winging Its awful way, The Infinite To meek hearts bringing. 'Tis said, of yore some child of pride Would vaunt him how his empire wide The bright sun never left. So in the Name of our dread King Of incense and pure offering We never are bereft. 'Tis morning here, 'tis evening there, And prayer must vary; But evermore through silent air, Nor dull nor weary, From earth, the censer at His feet, Mounts to the Lord the savour sweet Of that which once for all He gave upon the Cross, and we Give daily, earth's release to be From daily woe and thrall. Thus to Heaven's Bride, so chaste and fair, A voice is granted, To try unblam'd each solemn air In high Heaven chanted. Then mourn we not with drooping heart, Though half the globe may seem to part Our prayers from home and friends. Our matins meet their evensong, And the dread Offering, all day long, All prayer, all duty blends. The Eucharist of God's dear Son, Like Him undying, Is mighty, worlds and hearts in one For ever tying. Wherefore in solemn cheer we pass (Now that the Church hath turned her glass) From year to dawning year. All years to Him are one: and thou, In virtue of thy first dread vow Signing thyself in fear, Make haste, dear child, and onward press To high Communion:— Thy fragments He will glean, and bless With perfect union. X. Holy Seasons and Days. 1. CHRISTMAS EVE: VESPERS. “If it bear fruit, well: if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.” The duteous sun hath ceased to keep The vigil of His wondrous birth, Who in few hours, while sinners sleep, Shall dawn on thankless earth. The sun is set, the stars begin Their stations in His watch on high, As once around that Bethlehem inn; The vesper hour is nigh. A little maid with eager gaze Comes hurrying to the House of Prayer, Shaping in heart a wild green maze Of woodland branches there. One look,—a cloud comes o'er her dream: No burnished leaves, so fresh and clear, No berries with their ripe red gleam:— “There is no Christmas here.” What if that little maiden's Lord, The awful Child on Mary's knee, Even now take up the accusing word:— “No Christmas here I see. “Where are the fruits I yearly seek, As holy seasons pass away, Eyes turned from ill, lips pure and meek, A heart that strives to pray? “Where are the glad and artless smiles, Like clustering hollies, seen afar At eve along the o'ershaded aisles, With the first twilight star?” Spare, gracious Saviour, me and mine: Our tardy vows in mercy hear, While on our watch the cold skies shine Of the departing year. Ere we again that glimmering view, Cleansed be our hearts and lowly laid; The unfruitful plant do Thou renew, And all beneath its shade. By winter frosts and summer heats, By prunings sharp and waterings mild, Keen airs of Lent, and Easter sweets, Tame Thou the sour and wild. And dare we ask for one year more? Yea, there is hope: One waits on high To tell our contrite yearnings o'er, And each adoring sigh. If He in Heaven repeat our vow, We copying here His pure dread Will,— O dream of joy!—the withered bough May blush with fruitage still. 2. CHRISTMAS EVE: COMPLINE. “Rejoice in the Lord alway.” Rejoice in God alway, With stars in Heaven rejoice, Ere dawn of Christ's own day Lift up each little voice. Look up with pure glad eye, And count those lamps on high. Nay, who may count them? on our gaze They from their deeps come out in ever widening maze. Each in his stand aloof Prepares his keenest beam, Upon that hovel roof, In at that door, to stream, Where meekly waits her time The whole earth's Flower and Prime:— Where in few hours the Eternal One Will make a clear new day, rising before the sun. Rejoice in God alway, With each green leaf rejoice, Of berries on each spray The brightest be your choice. From bower and mountain lone The autumnal hues are gone, Yet gay shall be our Christmas wreath, The glistening beads above, the burnished leaves beneath. Such garland grave and fair His Church to-day adorns. And—mark it well—even there He wears His crown of thorns. Should aught profane draw near, Full many a guardian spear Is set around, of power to go Deep in the reckless hand, and stay the grasping Foe. Rejoice in God alway, With Powers rejoice on high, Who now with glad array Are gathering in the sky, His cradle to attend, And there all lowly bend. But half so low as He hath bowed Did never highest Angel stoop from brightest cloud. Rejoice in God alway, All creatures, bird and beast, Rejoice, again I say, His mightiest and His least; From ox and ass that wait Here on His poor estate, To the four living Powers, decreed A thousand ways at once His awful car to speed. Rejoice in God alway: With Saints in Paradise Your midnight service say, For vigil glad arise. Even they in their calm bowers Too tardy find the hours Till He reveal the wondrous Birth: How must we look and long, chained here to sin and earth! Ye babes, to Jesus dear, Rejoice in Him alway. Ye whom He bade draw near, O'er whom He loved to pray, Wake and lift up the head Each in his quiet bed. Listen: His voice the night-wind brings: He in your cradles lies, He in our carols sings. 3. CHRISTMAS DAY. (While waiting on an Infant at home.) “Behold I and the children which God hath given me.” Thou, who didst choose thine awful room Within the undefiled womb,— The bridal chamber, where our God For spousals high made brief abode, High spousals, evermore to bind The Godhead with our fallen kind:— Now while the o'er-arching clouds among Echoes the Angels' matin song, While, heart and hand, In every land The Saints their sacrifice prepare The Cradle to adore of Heaven's dread Heir, Behold where in the silent shade Thy slumbering little ones till matin prime are laid. Soon will a thousand bells ring out, A thousand roofs the choral shout Prolong, where Kings with Shepherds meet His manger with their gifts to greet. What shall we do, mine infant dear, Who may not those glad anthems hear? How shall we serve Him, thou and I, Far from that glorious company? Thou smil'st in sleep: Who knows how deep The dream of joy that smile denotes? Mild as the summer lightning, see, it floats, As if, the new-born Spirit o'er, Came voices low from where departed babes adore. Such is thy silent Liturgy, But what is ours who wait on thee? We offer thee to Him, this hour, Who in like slumber veil'd His power: Thy cradle with its hopes and fears, Thy May-day smiles and April tears, Whate'er thou hast, whate'er thou art, Howe'er thy mother's dreaming heart Shapes thy bright doom In years to come;— All with that offering would we blend, Which Saints on earth to Angel hands commend To bear on high, this favoured day, And on the sovereign Babe's unquenched altar lay. Mysterious are these smilse of thine; But of that Face, the Godhead's shrine, Those holy lips, that awful brow, Nor Angel then nor Prophet now Might truly deem; none trace aright Those hoverings of supernal light. No more to sight, in earth or heaven, Shall the Eternal Child be given, But, Infant dear, Unveiled and clear, Thou shalt behold Him as He died, Thine eye shall gaze upon the Crucified: In mercy may He meet thy gaze, And all the joy fulfil of all His bright glad days! 4. THE EPIPHANY. “They saw the young Child with Mary His Mother,.. and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto Him gifts.” How gaily seems the sun to rise On christening days and days of birth, Whether he smile in summer skies, Or faintly warm the wintry earth! Bright are the dreams he drives away, And bright the promise of that day. All charms, all gifts of Love are there, Love breathes in all the fragrant air. Oh haste we then to-day to greet Him who is born our glorious King: Of gold and myrrh and incense sweet Your treasures to His cradle bring. The Virgin Mother waiting by Your offering scans with earnest eye, Angels and Saints with jealous heed Watch if you bring your best indeed. And He, the Holiest, Humblest One, Making as though He could not see,— Yet is His Eye all hearts upon. O may He find some good in me! A poor, weak, wayward soul is mine, Yet own I, Lord, Thy saving sign. Thou seest me daily, how before Thy gracious footsteps I adore. Fain would I there my stores unfold, And of the gifts Thy Love hath given One heart restore of virgin gold, One prayer, like incense, seeking Heaven, One drop of penitential Love, Fragrant and dear to God above, Yet bitter in the mouth as gall, Fain would I bring Thee: 'tis mine all. O blessed, who with eyes so pure Have watched Thy cradle day by day, Thy look may in their hearts endure, Brightening their dim and weary way! Blest, whom sweet thoughts of Christmas tide Through all the year may guard and guide, As on those sages journeying smiled In dreams the Mother and the Child. 5. THE PURIFICATION. “The time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land.” What buds, what fragrant flowers are here! Not yet are Christmas garlands sere, The stern bleak months that lead the year Are frowning still, Yet forth they come, no stay, no fear, And bloom at will. Each nodding violet spray beneath What troops of tender nurslings breathe, Close set as gems in bridal wreath! April's last day No richer gift did e'er bequeath To brightening May. The snowdrops round the cottage door Are twinkling gay by tens and more, The merry children on the floor As gay within: The birds tell out their vernal lore With joyous din. As they prevent the matin prime, So, might it seem, sweet nature's chime Rings out, to greet the holy time. Heaven's softest airs Wait on the Maid who now shall climb The Temple stairs. Pure from her undefiled throes, Her virgin matron arms inclose The only Gift the wide earth knows Not all unmeet For the dread place where now she goes, His mercy-seat. See the Redeemer on His way Himself to be redeemed to-day: In humblest meekness see her lay Before the shrine Such offerings as poor matrons pay, Want's lowly sign. But soon the untimely vernal gleam Must fade away like morning dream, And ill winds blow, and cold mists stream On flower and leaf: So with the glad prophetic theme Come tones of grief. “The sword shall pierce thy very soul.” As on some gay glad hour might toll The funeral knell, or thunders roll O'er summer night, So did that word thy joy controul, Thou Virgin bright! Then, poor and orphan'd though I prove, Yet would I praise Thee, Lord, and love, And learn of Mary's spotless Dove, With moanings meek, And soft wing gliding high above, Thy Face to seek. 6. LENT. “Sanctify a fast..gather the children, and those that suck the breasts.” 'Tis said, the immortal Powers on high Might envy Saints on earth, for they can die; They for their Lord may suffer loss; Those but adore, these taste, the healing Cross. So while in all beside, dear babe, we pine For hope as pure as thine, One gift we have, one token more than thou, With choice of heart beneath the Saviour's yoke to bow. No deep of joy to thee is lost From Christmas, Easter, or bright Pentecost: No memory-cloud in air, to dim The unfolding heavens, or mar the Seraphs' hymn. The gladsome days are thine: to us are sent The wan soft gleams of Lent, The kindly waters from the heavens above, From earth to be exhal'd in dews of tearful love. Our portion in Christ's awful year, Not thine, is Lent: and yet He calls thee near. Come, spotless one, He seems to say, Come with thy pure white robe, and kneel to-day Beside the fallen and defil'd, and learn How keen the fires must burn Of the dread Spirit, purging contrite hearts With penitential pains, Truth in the inward parts. Oft have we mark'd thy wistful eye Fix'd upon ours when evil news came nigh, As who should say, “My dreams are bright, “Why should the cloud of woe on thee alight?” Then sweeter grew thy smile, thy soft caress Would closer seem to press, And for the woe, to thee yet unreveal'd, Pure balm of kindly hope thou didst unknowing yield. So be it now: the secret dark Of wasting sin here in God's awful ark In mercy may He keep from thee, Yet be thou near, our penance-hour to see, Our penance-hour to see, and deeply thrill At sense of unknown ill. Thou look'st an Angel: be thy presence found Like a bright Angel's here, guarding the holy ground. Oh much we need a loving spell, To scare away the Powers unclean and fell, Whom we too oft have tempted nigh, To bind our burden, dim our upward eye. Thou from the Font art fresh and undefiled: O surely, happy child, More than angelic power is where thou art, More than angelic love, to melt the cold dry heart. 7. EASTER EVE. “It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord.” The Primroses with kindly gleam Are looking out from bower and brake: As bright and quiet all things seem As if no heart on earth could ache. Yet He, the Sun who yester even Set in that wild tempestuous gloom, When graves flew wide, and rocks were riven, Still lingers in the dreary tomb. Nor blame our peace: for He will rise, His veil for evermore withdrawn. O never yet shone vernal skies So pure, as shall to-morrow dawn. 'Tis in that faith the flowers of Earth Their very best make speed to wear, And e'en the funeral mound gives birth To wild thyme fresh and violets fair. Stoop, little child, nor fear to kiss The green buds on this bed of death. Thou hast thy first baptismal bliss, Like new-born babe's, thy fragrant breath. Thy fragrant breath with this sweet air From brier and turf may duly blend: But keep it pure with Fast and Prayer, Come early near, and lowly bend. 8. EASTER-DAY. “I found Him whom my soul loveth: I held Him, and would not let Him go.” Twas at the matin hour, early before the dawn, The prison-doors flew open, the bolts of death were drawn. 'Twas at the matin hour, when prayers of Saints are strong, Where, two short days ago, He bore the spitting, wounds, and wrong, From realms unseen, an unseen way th' Almighty Saviour came, And following on His silent steps an Angel arm'd in flame. The stone is roll'd away, the keepers fainting fall; Satan's and Pilate's watchmen—the Day has scar'd them all. The Angel came full early, but Christ had gone before, The Breath of Life, the Living Soul, had breath'd itself once more Into the sacred Body that slumber'd in the tomb, As still and lowly, as erewhile in th' undefiled womb. And surely not in folds so bright the spotless winding sheet Inwrapt Him, nor such fragrance pour'd the myrrh and aloes sweet, As when in that chaste Bosom, His awful bed, He lay, And Mary's prayer around Him rose, like incense, night and day. And even as when her hour was come, He left His Mother mild A royal Virgin evermore, heavenly and undefil'd, So left the glorious Body the rock it slumber'd on, And spirit-like in silence past, nor touch'd the sealed stone. The Angel came full early, but Christ had gone before, Not for Himself, but for His Saints, is burst the prison door, That penitents who bring Him tears and perfume of good deeds May for His glory school their eyes, watching His funeral weeds. They who have sinn'd, though much they love,—they who have thrice denied,— 'Tis meet that they awhile beneath the garb of glory hide A shred of Jesus' grave-clothes, such robes as hermits weave; But Virgin Love needs only to behold, rejoice, believe. Dearest, be thine such portion: yet even so, in still And humble guise draw nigh: such is thy Saviour's will. Stoop lowly o'er His traces dim, and of His Angels learn Where face to face He will be met, and for that greeting yearn. Thou know'st He died not for Himself, nor for Himself arose: Millions of souls were in His Heart, and thee for one He chose. Upon the palms of His pierc'd Hands engraven was thy name, He for thy cleansing had prepar'd His water and His flame. Sure thou with Him art risen: and now with Him thou must go forth, And He will lend thy sick soul health, thy strivings, might and worth. Early with Him thou forth must fare, and ready make the way For the descending Paraclete, the third hour of the day. He veil'd His awful footsteps, our all-subduing Lord, Until the Blessed Magdalene beheld Him and ador'd. But through the veil the Spouse may see, for her heart is as His own, That to His Mother or by sight or touch He made Him known. And even as from His manger bed He gave her His first smile, So now, while Seraphs wait, He talks apart with her awhile; That thou of all the forms, which to thee His image wear, Might'st own thy parents first, with thy prime of loving care. And when that first spring-flower of love is gather'd, be thou seen Full soon with mourning Peter, and bereaved Magdalene, And meet with looks of soothing cheer the women on their way To find the Lord, nor from beside his musing comrades stray. To Emmaus see thou lose not the narrow path; for there With open face He tarries, to give thee Angels' fare. Where all His Saints assemble, make haste ere twilight cease, His Easter blessing to receive, and so lie down in peace. 9. WHITSUN EVE. “O my Dove, that art in the clefts of the Rock,...let me hear thy voice.” Well fare the Sage, whose dreams of old Would every cradle fain enfold In evening clouds of softest sound, Slow settling ear and heart around, Then with the breeze at morning prime Would mingle some heart-thrilling chime, Some Dorian movement, bold or grave, Such as in inmost soul they crave, Who, when the battles of the Lord are fought, Shrink from their own frail hearts, else fearing nought. Such strains have I desired erewhile, When haply with half-pitying smile, One of the attendant Spirits kind, Who float unseen on wave or wind, Might to another say, “Behold The dimly eyed and narrow-souled! He longs for music in the morn, Nor heeds the lark's unwearied horn. He finds at eve no soothing lullaby, Though west winds stir, and whispering pines are nigh.” O heavenly Wisdom, strong and sweet, How dost thou tune thy lyre, to meet The wakening or half-dreaming cares Of souls whom Love for Joy prepares! How do wild Nature's chords, by thee Combined in varying melody, Make tunes for holy times! e'en now, From underneath the fragrant bough, In notes of hopeful warning the fair Dove Gives token of the approaching morn of love. Soft are her tones; for He draws nigh, Who moveth all things quietly: Yet grave and deep; for to His sight Heaven's secrets are undazzling light: Content; for He on healing wings The promise of the Father brings: And Comfort is His name; yet so That in His promptings here below A wistful uncomplaining sadness still Must deeply blend with Joy's adoring thrill. As yet we but our vigil hold, Not yet the Whitsun flowers unfold Their full bright splendours. In the sky The third hour's sun must ride full high, Ere to the holy glorious room The fires of New-Creation come, Ere on weak hearts, though willing, fall The rushing mighty wind, in all The power of its dread harmony, and win, Ne'er to die down, true echoes from within. O loving Spirit, gently lay Thine arm on ours when we would stray! Prepare us with Thy warnings sweet, Us and our little ones, to greet Thy visitations dread and dear! Grant us, when holy times are near, In twilight or of morn or eve, Thy dove-like whisperings to receive, And own them kindlier for the plaintive mood, That breathes of contrite Love, mild Hope, and Joy subdued. 10. WHITSUNDAY. “The Promise is unto you, and to your children.” One the descending Flame, But many were the tongues of fire; From one bright Heaven they came, But here and there in many a spire, In many a living line they sped To rest on each anointed head. There, as yon stars in clearest deep of night, The glory-crowns shone out in many-coloured light. One the dread rushing Wind, But many were the tones of praise, Love guiding each to find His way in Music's awful maze. Many the tongues, the theme was one, The glory of th' Incarnate Son, How He was born, how died, how reigns in Heaven, And how His Spirit now to His new-born is given. Joined in that choral cry Were all estates, all tribes of earth: Only sweet Infancy Seemed silent in the adoring mirth. Mothers and maidens there behold The Maiden Mother: young and old On Apostolic thrones with joy discern Both fresh and faded forms, skill'd for all hearts to yearn. Widows from Galilee, Levites are there, and elders sage Of high and low degree; But nought we read of that sweet age Which in His strong embrace He took, And sealed it safe, by word and look, From Earth's foul dews, and withering airs of Hell: The Pentecostal chant no infant warblings swell. Nay, but she worships here, Whom still the Church in memory sees (O thought to mothers dear) Before her Babe on bended knees, Or rapt, with fond adoring eye, In her sweet nursing ministry.— How in Christ's Anthem fails the children's part, While Mary bears Him throned in her maternal heart? Hear too that Shepherd's voice, Whom o'er His lambs the Saviour set By words of awful choice, When on the shore His Saints He met. Blest Peter shows the key of Heaven, And speaks the grace to infants given: “Yours is the Promise, and your babes', and all, Whom from all lands afar the Lord our God shall call.” 11. OCTAVES OF FESTIVALS. “Blessed are the people that know the joyful sound.” Even as the close of some grave melody, Hovering and lingering in the moon's still ray, Breathes o'er and o'er, reviving ere they die, The notes that are the soul of the sweet lay, And hearts that own the music, loitering near, Drink the loved cadence with enchanted ear; So the bright holy days, as one by one They pass, a glorious week behind them draw. Nor will their echo cease till they outrun Their Octave: such is heavenly Music's law. Nor will Faith's ear grow weary of the strain, But long for the glad note to sound again. Whether the tones were pastoral, warbled low On Christmas Eve, but ere the bright sun rise, From thousand Seraphs in harmonious flow O'erspreading earth new-born and gladdened skies: Or in high triumph from beside the tomb The sudden anthem pierced the Paschal gloom: Or cloudlike soared the long-drawn melody, Still upward gliding where the Lord had gone: Or in all tongues the Pentecostal cry Rose from all lands in perfect unison:— For each and all, seven happy nights and days, The Church untiring holds her note of praise. For each and all, the eighth mysterious morn Doth of the first tell o'er the perfect tale. Lo, from Heaven's deep again the lays are borne That seem'd for ever past behind the veil. (For Thy dread Hours, Thou awful Trinity, Are but the Whitsun airs, new set on high.) 'Tis only our dull hearts that tire so soon Of Christ's repeated call; while they in Heaven, Unwearied basking in the eternal noon, Still sound the note, by the first Seraph given, What time the Morning Stars around their King Began for evermore to shine and sing. And you, ye gentle babes, true image here Of such as walk in white before the Throne, Ye weary not of Love, how oft soe'er Her yearnings she repeat in unchanged tone. To tale familiar, to remembered strain, To frolic ten times tried, ye cry, Again. How have I seen you, when the unpleasing time Came for some kindly guest to pass away, Cling round his skirts! how marked the playful chime Of earnest voices, pledged to make him stay! O deeply sink, and with a tearful spell, The memories of such welcome and farewell. Nor wants in elder love the like soft charm. The Mother tires not of one little voice, Even as she fain all day with patient arm Would bear one burthen. O frail heart, rejoice! Love trains thee now by repetition sweet The unwasting and unvarying bliss to greet.</field>
