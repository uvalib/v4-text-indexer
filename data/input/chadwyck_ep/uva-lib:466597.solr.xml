      <field name="fulltext">The Young Believer's Prayer. “Seek ye the Lord while He may be found, call ye upon Him while He is near.” —Isa. lv. 6. O God! may I look up to Thee? I would address Thee if I may; And this my one request should be, Teach me to pray. Now, in my sorrow, I would ask, What thoughts to think, what words to say; Prayer is a new and arduous task; Teach me to pray. A heartless form will not suffice, The self-deemed rich are sent away; The heart must bring the sacrifice— Teach me to pray. To whom shall I, Thy creature, turn? Whom else address? whom else obey? Teach me the lesson I would learn— Teach me to pray. Now, in my hour of trouble, deign To bow my spirit to Thy sway; Now, let me ask Thee not in vain— Teach me to pray. To Thee alone my eyes look up, Turn not, O God, Thy face away, Prayer is my only door of hope— Teach me to pray. The Sure Guide. “And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and said, Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not!” —Gen. xxviii. 16. Am I to this seclusion brought, As wandering Jacob first was taught, In solitude and woe, To look on things before unseen, And, in the stilly night serene, His Father's God to know? As alone and weary he was laid, A wondrous ladder was displayed, Reaching from earth to heaven; Ascending and descending there, Angels (who perhaps made him their care) To his charmed sight were given. He felt that God was in that place, He learned to prize and seek His grace, And there before Him vowed— “That if, through all his future track, “He thither came, in safety back, “The Lord should be his God.” Like him, a wanderer I have been, And waking, in this lonely scene, I feel that God is here; While, bright with supernatural ray, Shines forth that “new and living way” Which brings the sinner near. Apart from man, in this still hour, He, who might crush me by His power, A covenant deigns to make; And if, supplying all my need, He, to the end, my steps will lead, Him for my God I take. If health once more He deign to give, Then for His glory may I live, May all to Him be given! If not, while angels o'er me bend, Those golden steps may I ascend Which lead the soul to heaven! Prayer for Faith. “Christ shall give thee light.” —Eph. v. 24. Lord of all power and might! Grant me that inward sight Which views the things unseen; All earthly objects fade, My life a fleeting shade, Ne'er for one moment stayed, Will soon have crossed the scene. Each moment it moves on, Still hastening to be gone, Till, seen on earth no more, I reach that unknown state Where souls Thy sentence wait, To fix their lasting fate, And hope of change is o'er. Now, while there yet is time, While earth's brief day grows dim— Darkened by pain and woe; Kindle that lamp of faith Which can make bright my path, E'en through the vale of death, If thither now I go. Man cannot wake the spark In my soul's chamber dark— Nor keep the flame alive; Kindling Thyself the light, Deign Thou to keep it bright, Till, where is no more night, In safety I arrive. Thoughts in Seclusion. “In the day of adversity consider.” —Eccles. vii. 14. Lord, by Thy hand withdrawn apart From earthly things and outward scenes; What lessons wouldst Thou teach my heart? What barrier break that intervenes? Perchance to man my life has seemed Blameless, defiled by no dark blot; But blameless can that life be deemed In which my God has been forgot? Is it Thy wanderer to reclaim, That thou contendest now with me? Have I not missed life's noblest aim As yet, not having lived for Thee? How have my powers been misapplied! How has a creature, born to die, Been borne along the impetuous tide Of worldly care and vanity! Truths heard of by the outward ear I now discern, at least in part; “A still small voice” I seem to hear, Speaking in mercy to my heart. I boast of innocence no more; Guilty, yea guilty, Lord, I plead; My merits, trusted in before, Now fail me like a broken reed. Hard is that heart which ne'er has felt The love of God to sinful man; Which has not learned to mourn and melt, Pondering salvation's wondrous plan. “Blest is the man Thou chastenest, Lord!” Thus speaks the oracle divine; Now, on my heart let grace be poured, And may that blessedness be mine! The Wanderer's Return. “Before I was afflicted I went astray.” —Ps. cxix. 67. Light beams upon my inward eye, New thoughts awake, new things I see; Is this “the day-spring from on high,” Shining on me? The God of love my soul has met; He gently draws me from above; And though I do not love Him yet, I long to love. My time of suffering and distress Has proved His time of pardoning grace; Now, that He chastens but to bless I clearly trace. Earth's vanities my soul beguiled, I never sought His will to know; But to reclaim His wandering child, He brought me low. The past appears a feverish dream Of folly, and insensate mirth, And now the things eternal seem Of boundless worth. My soul, once dead, begins to move, Roused by a Hand divine from sleep, My heart, once cold, begins to love, My eye to weep. Lord, while this heavenly light is shed, Which, while I gaze, seems still t'increase, Shall not my wandering steps be led To paths of peace? Light of the world! Thou, thou hast shone, With life and healing in Thy ray! Now clear my path, and lead me on To realms of day. Go and Sin no More. John viii. 11. Speak, my Saviour, speak to me, With divine effectual power— Weeping, I look up to Thee— Bid me “go and sin no more.” Thou art full of pardoning love, Thou canst grant what I implore; Now Thy pitying mercy prove, Bid me “go and sin no more.” Thou upbraidest not Thy child; Deeply I the past deplore, Now with gracious accents mild, Bid me “go and sin no more.” Nothing can I see but sin, It has tainted my heart's core; There it spreads, without, within, Can “I go and sin no more?” 'Tis for man too hard a task, But Thou canst my soul restore; Saviour! this alone I ask— Bid me “go and sin no more.” Self-condemned—without a plea, Guilty—lost—like her of yore, Mine may her acquittal be! Bid me “go and sin no more.” Oh, how blest will be that day When, while I Thy love adore, I shall never need to say, Bid me “go and sin no more!” Light and Darkness. “The Lord God is a sun and shield.” —Psa. lxxxiv. 11. Oh! if I walked by sight, not faith, And could not view the things unseen, Dreary, to-day, would be my path, While round me wintry winds blow keen. The driving sleet, the darkened air, Look bleak and mournful to behold, While this poor frame, though fenced with care, Aches with the penetrating cold. The glorious sun, whose gladdening beams Make e'en the face of winter smile, Now distant and unwarming seems, Nature looks cheerless, for a while. Heavenward I turn, and then on me Shines forth a warm, unclouded ray; Sun of my soul! 'tis shed by Thee, I feel no more the wintry day. Amidst th'external gloom Thy voice Speaks words of comfort to my heart; Though weak, though lonely, I rejoice, Such gladness does that voice impart. It tells me of those mansions blest Where Thou a place hast deigned prepare— Where soon my soul shall sweetly rest— Where winter never chills the air. It tells me of that blissful state Where there shall be no pain, no gloom, Bids me a little moment wait, Till Thou shalt come to take me home. My Saviour! through Thy love divine, Which all has pardoned, all bestowed, I say, e'en now, “All things are mine,”— I possess all things in my God. Above the Heavens. “As the heaven is high above the earth, so great is His mercy toward them that fear Him.” —Psa. ciii. 11. I can gaze on that beautiful sky, Fair work of the Saviour I love; Though the health is withdrawn, and the vigour gone by, With which once 'mid His works I could rove. I can gaze on that beautiful sky, And there in bright characters trace That with mercy more great than that concave is high, My soul He has deigned to embrace. I can gaze on that beautiful sky, That temple so worthy of Him; While the fabrics of earth seem to dwindle and die, Compared with its glory sublime. I can gaze on that beautiful sky, And meekly rejoice in the thought, That above it, in glory ne'er seen by the eye, A mansion for me He has bought. I can gaze on that beautiful sky, And long the blue pathway to tread; There, with all His redeemed, to adore Him on high For the blood He on Calvary shed. I can gaze on that beautiful sky, And rejoice that my Saviour from heaven, In glory arrayed, will descend from on high, While the clouds for His chariot are given. Blessed are they that Mourn. I heard the voice of Love divine, Addressing man, to trouble born; Saviour! what accents then were Thine? “Blessed are they that mourn.” Again it spoke—“Come unto Me “Thou, with distress and labour worn, “Rest and refreshment are for thee: “Blessed are they that mourn.” I heard a voice in truth's pure word, A saint, who sorrow's yoke had borne, “Blest is the man Thou chastenest, Lord!” “Blessed are they that mourn.” I heard an angel voice proclaim, Yon victors bright, whom crowns adorn, “Through tribulation great they came!” “Blessed are they that mourn.” Why should I then for sufferings grieve, Since sorrow leads to joy's bright bourne? Let me indeed the words believe, “Blessed are they that mourn!” The Moon over the Sea. Oh! fix on that beautiful planet thine eye; Observe her bright course as she travels on high, And bears, like a vestal, her lamp through the sky, Arrayed in her garments of light: While pure and exalted her pathway she treads, O'er the rough sea beneath her, soft radiance she sheds; Where'er she approaches, the darkness recedes, Till, in beauty, she glides from our sight. Fair orb! there are some in this world of our own, Like thyself, who in light and in silence move on; They walk in “white raiment,” and calmly look down On life's turbulent ocean beneath: The noise of its waves at a distance they hear; And, shedding soft light from their luminous sphere, This region of darkness and sorrow they cheer, And are beautiful even in death. For New Year's Day. “What shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits toward me.” —Psa. cxvi. 12. I come, my Lord, to offer up to Thee A worthless but a willing offering; A heart where only evil I can see, Yet not for that refuse the gift I bring; Oh, deign to accept it—cast each evil out, And make it pure and new within, without. I come, my Lord, to offer up to Thee All it now suffers of distress and pain; It is Thine own; work Thou Thy will in me; Let me not once resist it, or complain, But meekly in my sufferings acquiesce, Assured that Thou each pang wilt deign to bless. I come, my Lord, to offer up to Thee All that that heart can dictate or perform; Let Thy blest Spirit its controller be, Let Thy pure love its every movement warm; And make that heart, once sin's defiled abode, The holy habitation of my God. I come, my Lord, to offer up to Thee The brief remainder of life's fleeting span; Whate'er I have, or am, Thine own shall be, Without Thee I will form no wish nor plan: Time, talents, influence, actions, thoughts, and words, All, all be unreservedly my Lord's! I come, my Lord, to offer up to Thee A creature made Thine own by every tie; Hast Thou not formed, preserved, and ransomed me? Oh, didst Thou not to pay my ransom, die? Lord, at Thy feet my worthless self I lay, Oh, never, never cast me thence away. Why should I Fear to Die? I need not fear to die, My Lord has conquered death; And He has promised to draw nigh When I resign my breath. His word is truth—on that I build, Assured that word shall be fulfilled. Sometimes I long to die! My nest is stirred up here; Earth's ties are few; I long to fly To a serener sphere: Where sin, and toil, and war shall cease; And all be holiness and peace. Why should I fear to die? In that sweet home above Are gathering all my family, And all the friends I love; Heavenward I look, and breathe the prayer, Soon, soon their happiness to share. Surely 'tis time to die! My “threescore years and ten” Are overpast, and oft I cry, “How long, my Lord? Oh! when Wilt Thou my ransomed spirit free, And bid Thy child come home to Thee?” Then, Saviour, let me die! My sweetest moments here Are those when, deigning to draw nigh, Thou whisperest, “I am near.” And e'en from these bright glimpses given I feel Thy presence must be heaven. Oh! when I come to die, These glories let me see, Ne'er grasped by human thought or eye, Reserved in heaven by Thee; And show me, 'mid the parting strife, That death is better far than life! On Leaving Home. This gracious promise, Lord, fulfil, Now that I leave a home so dear: My soul's sweet home is present still If Thou art near. Beneath Thy wings if I remain, My home! my hiding-place! my rest! Sheltered, and safe, and freed from pain, My soul is blest. Thy presence fills my mind with peace, Brightens the thoughts so dark erewhile, Bids cares and sad forebodings cease, Makes all things smile. This striking of my pilgrim tent No longer mournful will appear, If Thy reviving presence lent The traveller cheer. The spacious earth is all thine own; What land soe'er my steps invite, That land Thine eye will rest upon By day, by night. I ask not health—I ask not ease, I ask in Thee my rest to find; To all Thy sovereign will decrees, Be mine resigned! Guide every step where'er I go; Dictate each action, word, and thought; With those “fresh springs” from Thee that flow, Let all be fraught! If soon my sun of life shall set, Still let me work, ere sinks that sun: Nor mourn at last with vain regret My task undone. Link me with those who fear Thy name, Whose zeal, and faith, and love shine bright, And let them feed my lamp's weak flame With their pure light. Whether again my home I see, Or yield, on foreign shores, my breath, Take not Thy presence, Lord, from me, In life or death! In Thee, my hiding-place divine, Be rest throughout life's journeyings given, Then sweeter, holier rest be mine With Thee in heaven! Safe on the other Side! “The fear of death is fallen upon me.” —Psa. lv. 4. Oh, let my faith these tears control, Still, still I dread the unfathomed tide! What will it be to find my soul Safe on the other side! What will it be to hear that voice Which bids each trembling fear subside? In His sweet presence to rejoice Safe on the other side! To see His beauty, taste His love, Be with His likeness satisfied; To know I ne'er can thence remove, Safe on the other side! To feel that all my bonds are riven, This weary body cast aside, To know that I am safe in heaven! Safe on the other side! No death to fear, no cross to bear, No more to hear His truth denied To know sin cannot enter there: Safe on the other side! To meet our loved ones “gone before!” To see them blest and glorified! To know that we can part no more, Safe on the other side! All this, and joys so vast, so great, As human thought ne'er verified, Are laid up in that glorious state, Safe on the other side! And yet with coward fears I shrink From passing through that gulf untried— Oh! haste thee quickly, cross the brink, Safe to the other side! Jesus! Thou conqueror of death! My hope, my shield, my guard, my guide, Waft me, Thy sheltering arms beneath, Safe to the other side! By the Death-bed of a Friend. “He giveth His beloved sleep.” —Psa. cxxvii. 2. Lie down in peace to take thy rest, Dear cherished form, no longer mine, But bearing in thy clay-cold breast A hidden germ of life divine, Which, when the eternal spring shall bloom, Will burst the shackles of the tomb. Lie down in peace to take thy rest, Unbroken will thy slumbers be, Satan can now no more molest, And death has done his worst on thee; Lie down, thy hallowed sleep to take, Till clothed with glory thou shalt wake. Lie down in peace to take thy rest, We can no longer watch thy bed; But glorious angels, spirits blest, Shall guard thee day and night instead; And when thine eyes unclosed shall be, Christ in His glory they shall see. Lie down in peace to take thy rest! My eyes must weep—my heart must mourn; But to the thought that thou art blest, For comfort and for hope I turn; Thou wilt not mark these tears that flow, Sorrow can never reach thee now! Lie down in peace to take thy rest! Let me betake myself to prayer, Binding faith's corslet on my breast, Lest Satan find an entrance there; God gave—though now His gift He claim, Still blessed be His holy name! Safe in Christ. “My sheep hear My voice, and they shall never perish; neither shall any pluck them out of My hand.” —John x. 27, 28. Clouds and darkness round about Thee For a season veil Thy face, Still I trust—and cannot doubt Thee, Jesus! full of truth and grace: Resting on Thy words I stand, None shall pluck me from Thy hand, Oh, rebuke me not in anger! Suffer not my faith to fail! Let not pain, temptation, languor, O'er my struggling heart prevail! Holding fast Thy word I stand, None shall pluck me from Thy hand. In my heart Thy words I cherish, Though unseen, Thou still art near; Since Thy sheep shall never perish, What have I to do with fear? Trusting in Thy word I stand, None shall pluck me from Thy hand. The Perfect Example. “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.” —Phil. ii. 5. Ever patient, gentle, meek, Holy Saviour! was Thy mind; Vainly in myself I seek Likeness to my Lord to find; Yet that mind which was in Thee, May be, must be formed in me. Days of toil, 'mid throngs of men, Vexed not, ruffled not thy soul; Still collected, calm, serene, Thou each feeling couldst control: Lord, that mind which was in Thee May be, must be formed in me. Though such griefs were Thine to bear, For each sufferer Thou couldst feel; Every mourner's burden share, Every wounded spirit heal; Saviour! let Thy grace in me Form that mind which was in Thee. When my pain is most intense, Let Thy cross my lesson prove: Let me hear Thee, e'en from thence, Breathing words of peace and love: Saviour! let Thy grace in me Form that mind which was in Thee. Not my Will, but Thine. “Let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to Him.” —1 Peter iv. 19. O God! from whom my spirit came, Moulded by Thee, this mortal frame Feels health or sickness, pain or ease, As it may best Thy wisdom please: Make me submissive—keep me still, Suffering according to Thy will. The springs of life are in Thy hand, They move, they stop at Thy command; Without Thy blessing will prove vain All human skill to ease my pain: Make me submissive—keep me still, Suffering according to Thy will. I am a sinner—shall I dare To murmur at the strokes I bear? Strokes, not in wrath, but mercy sent, A wise and needful chastisement: Make me submissive—keep me still, Suffering according to Thy will. Saviour! I breathe the prayer once Thine, “Father! Thy will be done, not mine!” One only blessing would I claim; In me O glorify Thy name! Make me submissive—keep me still, Suffering according to Thy will. Thou God seest Me. “When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then Thou knewest my path.” —Psa. cxlii. 3. My God! whose gracious pity I may claim, Calling Thee “Father,” sweet endearing name! The sufferings of this weak and weary frame, All, all are known to Thee. From human eyes 'tis better to conceal Much that I suffer, much I hourly feel; But oh, this thought can tranquillise and heal, All, all is known to Thee. Each secret conflict with indwelling sin; Each sickening fear, “I ne'er the prize shall win;” Each pang from irritation, turmoil, din, All, all are known to Thee. When in the morning unrefreshed I wake, Or in the night but little rest can take, This brief appeal submissively I make, All, all is known to Thee. Nay, all by Thee is ordered, chosen, planned, Each drop that fills my daily cup, Thy hand Prescribes for ills none else can understand, All, all is known to Thee. The effectual means to cure what I deplore, In me Thy longed-for likeness to restore, Self to dethrone, never to govern more, All, all are known to Thee. And this continued feebleness—this state, Which seems t'unnerve and incapacitate, Will work the cure my hopes and prayers await, That cure I leave to Thee. Nor will the bitter draught distasteful prove, While I recall the Son of Thy dear love; The cup Thou wouldst not for our sakes remove— That cup He drank for me. He drank it to the dregs—no drop remained Of wrath—for those whose cup of woe He drained: Man ne'er can know what that sad cup contained: All, all is known to Thee. And welcome, precious, can His Spirit make My little drop of suffering for His sake; Father! the cup I drink—the path I take, All, all are known to Thee! A Present Help. “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.” Psa. xlvi. 1. God of pity! God of love! Send me comfort from above; Let not anxious thoughts perplex, Harrowing fears my spirit vex: Let me trust Thee, and be still, Waiting patiently Thy will. Though to weak short-sighted man All uncertain seems each plan; Each event Thy will ordains, Fixed immutably remains: Not one link in life's long chain Can be lost, or wrought in vain. All that chain, through bygone years, Woven in links of love appears; Not one storm of vengeful wrath E'er has swept across my path: Why should fear o'er faith prevail? Thy sure mercies cannot fail. What are distance, time, or place, To that God who fills all space? What are sea or land to Him? Can the Omniscient eye grow dim? Those we love, (whate'er betide,) O'er them does that eye preside. Clinging to Thy strengthening arm, Thou wilt keep me safe from harm; Thou wilt grant the hope that cheers Will prove better than my fears; Bid my sad misgivings cease; Guide me to my home in peace. Paternal Chastening. “If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons.” Heb. xii. 7. Oh cheer thee, cheer thee, suffering saint! Though worn with chastening, be not faint! And though thy night of pain seem long, Cling to thy Lord—in Him be strong, He marks, He numbers every tear, Not one faint sigh escapes His ear. Oh cheer thee, cheer thee! He has traced Thy track through life, from first to last; Each stage, the present, childhood, youth, Has borne fresh witness to that truth: Which soon will tune thy harp above, “Loved with an everlasting love.” Yes, cheer thee, cheer thee! though thine ear, Quickened by suffering, scarce can bear The voice of those who love thee best, Not lonely art thou, not unblest; Thy soul's Beloved ever nigh Bends o'er thee, whispering, “It is I!” Oh cheer thee, cheer thee! now's the hour To Him to lift thine eye for power, His all-sufficiency to show, E'en in extremity of woe: While in the furnace to lie still, This is indeed to do His will. Then cheer thee, cheer thee! though the flame Consume thy wasting, suffering frame; His gold ne'er suffers harm or loss, He will but purge away the dross, And fit it, graced with many a gem, To form His glorious diadem. And He will cheer thee, He will calm Thy pain intense with heavenly balm, Show thee the martyr's white-robed throng, Thy place prepared that host among; That weight of glory will o'erpower The anguish of life's suffering hour. Yes, He will cheer thee—He will prove The soul encircled by His love Can meekly, midst her anguish, say,— “Still will I trust Him though He slay;” And He will make His words thine own— “Father! Thy will, not mine, be done.” Strong Consolation. “I will not leave you comfortless.” —John xiv. 18. Holy Comforter! who guidest Those who seek Thine aid divine! Who in contrite hearts abidest, Now, amidst my darkness, shine! Though around me waves are swelling, And the storms of life increase, If my heart be made Thy dwelling, I shall still be kept in peace. 'Tis Thine office, blessed Spirit! Christ's remembrancer to be; Though such grace I cannot merit, Now recall His words to me; Though with grief my heart seems broken, Though the waves go o'er my soul; Every word, by Jesus spoken, Makes the wounded spirit whole. God of peace and consolation! Pour this balm upon my mind; In my Saviour's Cross and Passion Strength and healing let me find! Is the outward man decaying? Be the inward man renewed! Now, Thy power and love displaying, Cheer my mournful solitude. Take the things to Christ belonging, Manifest His love to me; Check these thoughts of anguish, thronging This poor heart, resigned to Thee; Show me life nor death can sever From my soul that heavenly Friend,— Tell me He is mine for ever, And will love me to the end. To Die is Gain. Phil. i. 21. O much beloved! fear not to die, Lift up to heaven thy tearful eye; And see, prepared for thee, A mansion where no sins, no foes, Shall ever break thy sweet repose, Through all eternity. Why should'st thou fear to die, when death Is but to yield thy mortal breath, And lay this frame aside, “Fearfully, wonderfully made”— Yet now, enfeebled, worn, decayed, And oft with suffering tried? Death must dissolve it; flesh and blood Can enter not that pure abode Where Christ His face unveils: Then since by death, and death alone, Can be attained that bliss unknown, Shrink not when death assails. To Nature his approach seems sad, But Faith rejoices, and is glad His coming step to hear: She knows that though the hand be rough That strikes the soul's hard fetters off, Each blow brings freedom near. Then when the captive is set free, What life, what joy, what liberty Will heaven's bright gates unfold! The last pang felt, the last sigh heaved, Faith's great reward will be received, Christ Jesus to behold! Christ in His glory! oh, the thought With bliss ineffable is fraught; And when the soul holds fast That blessed hope which He has given, Of endless life with Him in heaven, Aside all fears are cast. Then, much beloved, fear not to die! Lift up by faith thy tearful eye, And see, in heaven prepared, A place where near Him thou shalt be, Where by thyself, eternally, His glory shall be shared. Prayer against Impatience. Lord, when I see Thee as Thou art, No sufferings then will wake a sigh; Grant the one wish that fills my heart, To glorify Thee ere I die! When I would murmur and complain, Fix on Thy cross my tearful eye; Mine is far lighter to sustain; Oh, make me patient ere I die! What countless blessings Thou hast given, Though health it please Thee to deny, Thy precious blood—a home in heaven! Oh, make me thankful, ere I die! Thou art my stem, my life, my root: Sap to Thy feeblest branch supply; Those who “abide in Thee” bear fruit— Oh, make me fruitful, ere I die! Too often do I go astray; Unstable—weak—alas! am I; Oh, keep me in Thyself, my Way; Make me consistent, ere I die! Oh, prove, by making all things new, Thou dost within me rule, not I; Let grace the carnal mind subdue, And make me heavenly, ere I die! None without holiness can see Thy glorious beauty, “eye to eye:” But if my heart Thy temple be, I shall be holy, ere I die. Let every grace combine to prove Thy Spirit seals me from on high; Faith, meekness, resignation, love, Let each adorn me, ere I die. Show that I am in Thee “complete;” In me Thy mercy magnify; Let all around Thy praise repeat, By me awakened, ere I die. Thou art the Lord my Righteousness, No other wedding robe need I; Jehovah's eye no spot will trace, In it arrayed I'm fit to die. This, this alone can safety give When death's appalling hour draws nigh; If it be “Christ” to me “to live,” It will be “gain” indeed “to die.” The Unfailing Friend. “He hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.” —Heb. xiii. 5. The thought that I must leave, ere long, My friends beloved, at times will grieve me; But this, e'en then, shall be my song,— The Lord will never, never leave me. Well mayest Thou ask, O Friend Divine, “Am I thy God? dost thou believe Me?” Lord, 'tis enough if Thou art mine, If Thou wilt never, never leave me! Whither I go my friends will come, Death will enrich and not bereave me; Will waft me to that blessed home Where Thou wilt never, never leave me. From the rough passage shall I start When there Thou waitest to receive me? When I shall see Thee as Thou art, And Thou wilt never, never leave me. Thou'rt gone my mansion to prepare, Thou art the Truth—canst Thou deceive me? Soon Thou wilt reunite us there, Nor e'er forsake nor ever leave me! For a Sunday in Solitude. Let me put on my fair attire, My heavenly “robes of richest dress,” And tune my consecrated lyre, Lord of the Sabbath! Thee to bless. Oh, may no spot of sin to-day My raiment, “clean and white,” defile! And while I tune my heartfelt lay, Bend down on me Thy gracious smile. Let holy feelings, heavenly themes, Raise and refresh and fill my mind! And earth's low vanities and schemes Nor place nor entertainment find! The looks, the thoughts, the sweet employ Of saints, whose treasure is above, Be mine to-day—their zeal, their joy, Their peace, and purity, and love. My spirit may with theirs unite, My humble notes with theirs may blend, Though still denied the pure delight Thy sacred courts with them t'attend. “The faith and patience of the saints,” These I may exercise each hour; When, weak with pain, the body faints, I best may manifest their power. Oh, Saviour! with completion crown Desires Thou wakenest not in vain; Stoop to Thy lowly temple down: Bring all these graces in Thy train. This is Thy day of bounty, Lord! I ask no small, no stinted boon, But showers, rich showers of blessing, poured On me, though worthless and alone. If the weak tendril round Thee twine, It ne'er is hidden from Thine eye; I cling to Thee, life-giving Vine! Strength, verdure, fruitfulness, supply. I come to Thee. “Into Thine hand I commit my spirit: Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth.” —Psa. xxxi. 5. God of my life! Thy boundless grace Chose, pardoned, and adopted me; My rest, my home, my dwelling-place! Father! I come to Thee. Jesus, my hope, my rock, my shield! Whose precious blood was shed for me, Into Thy hands my soul I yield; Saviour! I come to Thee. Spirit of glory and of God! Long hast Thou deigned my guide to be; Now be Thy comfort sweet bestowed! My God! I come to Thee. I come to join that countless host Who praise Thy name unceasingly; Blest Father, Son, and Holy Ghost! My God! I come to Thee. Forsake Me Not. “Be not Thou far from me, O Lord; O my strength, haste Thee to help me.” —Psa. xxii. 19. Forsake me not, my God, my heart is sinking, Bowed down with faithless fears and bodings vain; Busied with dark imaginings, and drinking Th'anticipated cup of grief and pain; But, Lord, I lean on Thee; Thy staff and rod Shall guide my lot, I will not fear if Thou, my God, my God, Forsake me not! Forsake me not, my God! man must forsake me, And earth grow dim, and vanish from my sight; Through death's dark vale no human hand may take me, No friend's fond smile may bless me with its light: Alone the silent pathway must be trod Through that drear spot, For I must die alone—Oh! then, my God, Forsake me not. Forsake me not, my God! when darkly o'er me Roll thoughts of guilt, and overwhelm my heart; When the accuser, threatening, stands before me, And trembling conscience writhes beneath the dart; Thou who canst cleanse, by Thine atoning blood, Each sinful spot, Plead Thou my cause, my Saviour and my God! Forsake me not. Forsake me not, O Thou, Thyself forsaken, In that mysterious hour of agony, When, from Thy soul, Thy Father's smile was taken, Which had from everlasting dwelt on Thee! Oh, by that depth of anguish which to know Passes man's thought, By that last bitter cry, incarnate God, Forsake me not! In Sleeplessness or Pain. Celestial Guardian! Thou who slumberest not, Does not Thy gracious eye behold the spot On which this weak and weary frame reclines, Though now no cheering light around me shines? Oh yes! with heavenly pity Thou look'st down On me, e'en me, whose sins deserve Thy frown; Gild now th'oppressive darkness with Thy smile, And these sad hours of restlessness beguile. Though sweet repose forsake my uneasy bed, Like silent dew Thy grace benignant shed; If Thou beside me these night-watches keep, Thy presence will refresh far more than sleep. The restless, feverish body Thou canst calm, And on th'unquiet mind drop healing balm; Canst round the soul such cheering radiance pour, That outward darkness shall be felt no more. Oh Thou! who, when on earth, would'st oft repair To some lone mount, and pass the night in prayer, Set free my spirit from its cumbrous clod, And be these waking hours all spent with God. In Deep Waters. “Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves therefore with the same mind.” —1 Peter iv. 1. When passing through deep waters Of bitter pain and grief, That sun is veiled which scatters The clouds of unbelief; When past sins gather round me In all their crimson hue, And foes unseen confound me With taunts, alas! too true— When human hopes all wither, And friends no aid supply; Then whither, Lord, ah, whither Can turn my straining eye? 'Mid storms of grief still rougher, 'Midst darker, deadlier shade, That cross, where Thou didst suffer, On Calvary was displayed. On that my gaze I fasten, My refuge that I make; Though sorely Thou mayest chasten, Thou never canst forsake: Thou on that cross didst languish Ere glory crowned Thy head; And I, through death and anguish, Must be to glory led. On Recovery from Illness. “Not my will, but Thine, be done.” —Luke xxii. 42. It is Thy will; my Lord! my God! And I, whose feet so lately trod The margin of the tomb, Must now retrace my weary way, And in this land of exile stay, Far from my heavenly home. It is Thy will; and this, to me, A check to every thought shall be, Which else might dare rebel; Those sacred words contain a balm Each sad regret to soothe and calm, Each murmuring thought to quell. It is Thy will; that will be done! To Thee the fittest time is known, When, by Thy grace made meet, My longing soul shall soar away, And leave her prison-house of clay, To worship at Thy feet. It is Thy will; and must be mine, Though here, far off from Thee, I pine, And find no place of rest; When shall the poor bewildered dove, Now, o'er the waters doomed to rove, Be sheltered in Thy breast? It is Thy will; and now anew Let me my earthly path pursue With one determined aim; To Thee to consecrate each power, To Thee to dedicate each hour, And glorify Thy name. It is Thy will; I seek no more; Yet, if I cast towards that bright shore A longing, tearful eye, It is because, when landed there, Sin will no more my heart ensnare Nor Satan e'er draw nigh. More than Conqueror. “We are more than conquerors through Him who hath loved us.” Rom. viii. 37. Hark! what voice of love is speaking 'Mid these throes of pain and death? Light upon my soul is breaking E'en while struggling thus for breath; Welcome, then, this dying anguish, These cold dews that steep my brow! That blest hour for which I languish Cannot be far distant now! All my outward senses, failing, Part me from terrestrial things; But my soul, new life inhaling, Fluttering, striving, spreads her wings; Ye, who tenderest watch are keeping— Though these hours seem dark indeed— Think, while o'er my sufferings weeping, Thus th'imprisoned soul is freed. Be the prison bars demolished! King of terrors, break them down! But, thy further power abolished, Christ thy conqueror thou must own: He is with me, He is near me! He thy every stroke directs! His belovèd accents cheer me, He the soul He saved protects! Lord, Thou comest to receive me! Oh, what faithfulness is Thine! Now, when every friend must leave me, Come to be for ever mine! Lo! the beatific vision Breaks on my enraptured sight! Weighed with this divine fruition E'en the pangs of death seem light. When Expecting Suffering. “Call upon Me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me.” —Psa. l. 15. My God! the dreaded hour draws near, Nature shrinks back, and faints with fear, My heart within me dies; But still on Thee, who know'st my frame, Who torture hast endured, and shame, On Thee my hope relies. I make no arm of flesh my stay— All human powers Thy will obey— All means on Thee depend— Whate'er that will appoint for me, In life, in death, Thine let me be, Support me to the end! Give me that faith which nerves the soul, That love which can all fear control, Which “all things can endure;” Now, in my time of utmost need, My Saviour! let me find indeed Thy word of promise sure. Stand by me—speak those words divine, “I have redeemed thee, thou art Mine, “Thee will I ne'er forsake;” Say to my agitated heart, Nothing from Thee my soul shall part, Nor Thy sure covenant break. And if a creature so defiled, Whom yet Thou deign'st to call Thy child, May ask one boon beside, 'Tis this—that in my suffering hour Thy grace may manifest its power, Thy name be glorified. Abba, Father. “Ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.” —Rom. viii. 15. Thou, who searchest every heart, Bend on mine Thy pitying eye! Pardon, cleansing, peace, impart, Abba, Father, hear my cry! Grant that pardon Christ implored From His cross on Calvary; Through my dying, pleading Lord, Abba, Father, hear my cry! Water from His side, and blood, Flowed to wash sin's deepest dye; Bathe me in that cleansing flood, Abba, Father, hear my cry! Earthly cares and woes increase, But from them to Thee I fly, Jesu's legacy was peace— Abba, Father, hear my cry! Dark may be life's mournful day, Still no tear should dim my eye; This sweet name drives grief away, Abba, Father, hear my cry! Pardon, cleansing, peace, impart, All my need through Christ supply; With His Spirit fill my heart, Abba, Father, hear my cry! The Sheltering Wing. My Saviour! when I come to die, Look down on me with pitying eye, For Thy sweet mercy's sake; Shield my foreboding, trembling heart, From the accuser's fiery dart! Thy wings my covering make! Thou knowest, Lord, my only plea Is sovereign grace, too rich, too free, Too omnipotent to doubt; It drew me—led me to Thy feet; To hear Thee those blest words repeat, “Ne'er will I cast thee out.” In childhood, through that grace divine, To Thee my heart did I resign; And though in after years I wandered far in sin's dark track, Mercy pursued and brought me back, With floods of contrite tears. Still has that mercy led me on; For more than “forty years” has shone O'er life's long pathway traced; And now, methinks, I see it gleam From far, o'er Jordan's billowy stream, Whither my footsteps haste. Saviour! Thy voice can banish fear, And if Thou deignest to draw near When most I need Thine aid; If, when the cold waves round me swell, “The everlasting arms” I feel, I shall not be dismayed! Mercy will bear me safely through, Mercy, sweet mercy, still pursue, Brightening the dark rough wave, And land me on that peaceful shore Where enemies are known no more, Omnipotent to save. The Ever-present Helper. “Lord, be thou my helper.” —Psa. xxx. 10. When all outward comfort flies, And my heart within me dies, Hear, oh hear my trembling sighs: Help me, O my Saviour! When the day brings pain and grief, Night, nor respite, nor relief, Whisper—“These dark hours are brief:” Help me, O my Saviour! When all human help proves vain, And my agonising pain More than nature can sustain. Help me, O my Saviour! Suffer not my faith to fail, Let not Satan's darts assail, Lift the intercepting vail: Help me, O my Saviour! When, oppressed with feverish heat, I can scarce one text repeat, Say, I am in Thee complete: Help me, O my Saviour! When the means for pain's redress Seem to aggravate distress, Then draw near—my faith increase: Help me, O my Saviour! When the long and suffering night Makes me weary for the light, Fix upon Thy cross my sight: Help me, O my Saviour! Lest I faint beneath the rod, Say—“This very path I trod; “Thus thou glorifiest God:” Help me, O my Saviour! Let me not on man depend, But on Thee, the unfailing Friend: Be Thou near me to the end: Help me, O my Saviour! Thou, Thou only canst relieve me! Till Thine arms of love receive me, Whisper—“I will never leave thee!” Help me, O my Saviour!</field>
