      <field name="fulltext">PART I DIONYSUS ZAGREUS AI, ai! The pursuit of my hunters illuded, I pant, I stretch on the spines of this desolate forest. Rock on rock, as bone on bone in a body Sucked of its flesh by the wind and sunshine and days, Rock is loose-piled on rock; and below, a continuous whiteness Roars in my ears and swirls through my sight. O torrent, Beguiler of those who would murder me, savage to keep My anguish in prison to hear and to watch thy flood Crave, as no multitude craves for its prey, For my loneliness, sorrow, All pain I can know 'mid the pulses of breath, All fears with their smarting languor, all wrongs I suffer That heave the sources of grief and yet, as an earthquake swallows A fountain, banish my tears down their blinded gulfs, O torrent, you need my godhead in manhood to stay you From hunger so infinite . . . those whom thy fury baffled Had need but of flesh, my flesh and the jets of my blood. I lie on the spines that prick me, on moss-chilled soil, No longer pursued. . . . Ai, ai! but above me, around, Beneath me pursuit, as a Power of the earth and air, Rules in the silence, the silence no Men approach. The rocks evoke a terror, like lions that couch; The stream gives the terror of appetite fierce to spring On my passions in lust, and the wind moves around my form As it wandered in stealth to capture: the mountain eagle Watches grey on the roofless walls of rock. I, who love the shooting and summer of trees, See the pale firs above, the constant-hued, The mad-rent boughs of mourning that has no end, Cybele's tortured grief for the love-lost Atys. Grieving trees of the dark shade, how I dread you! I, the son of a god, in the form of man, Lie on the troublous spines with a mighty burthen Thrust on my human weakness, the burthen of craft, Of Nature's patience and craft that pursue a mortal Steadily, open-eyed, with terrible gold in the gaze, Sunshine's pitiless blank. I ran from men, the cruel, That sought my life; but here I lie down, I slumber Struck with the charm of the elements, held submissive To vast inflictions, to impious, secret Death. O trees, pale firs of the dark, dark shade, O scenting wind, O rock-edged quietude, O voice that slides like thunder through the gorge, O eagle-wings at poise, I yield, I sleep, Laid on the moss-chilled ground With rhododendron's hard tufts A ridge about my body as a tomb's, I yield to die. I who have fled from men In gnashing hate, with speed as swift as hate, I yield undone To you, the great, obliterating airs, To you, the world's rapacious substances Grown still to feedâearth, sunlight, and yon bird That watches grey above the roofless rocks. My father's bird, His witness looking onâ Not sent to feed on me, his child, but sent To bear the record of this great temptation, And how it fails or triumphs, to the sky, Where in unthwarted power the gods abide. O kingly feathers sweep the stone! It may be I mistake The meaning of these watchers at my side, As I mistook, O bird, thy hoary guard. Zeus, can it be, My father, that this dreadful peace is made About me for my glory, not defeat? I must lie quiet and humble on the ground, As if in very deed obdurate Death Were on me parched and cold. . . . Thus I must lie until the silence break Again into disclosure: yet no more The wilderness repels, where all things wait. The preying, slant-head bird, With eye and beak intent upon my sloth, Wheels, now I raise my limbs, Reveals himself august, God's messenger, my father's twin-throned joy. I rise, I bend the pale firs to my grasp, I break the whitened whorls, the honied cones; I of such sorrows, greater than a man's, I, the rejected, hunted, mad, unwelcome, I weave these tragic bunches in a wreath, Fit crown for ever, of my misery; Yea, I am crowned with the dark-shading boughs I dreaded and I choose them as my own; Heart's anguish in a garland, in a knot Of cones and shadow-spines upon my wand, My wand cast down beside me when the force, Next to a god's, of Nature laid me low. Evoe! Ye rocks, A King leaps over you with crown of fir, With sceptre of the hard fruit of the fir, Choosing to turn all sorrow into life, All darkness into motion, all mad pain And burthen into realms beneath his sway. O torrent, from thy writhing voice I learn The rhythm of this my empire, dithyrambs That rush and break and rage ineffably, Songs of the Clamour-King. O rocks, O rocks, One day my ritual shall beat your floors With dance and feet that scorn you, scoop your sides To show amid you to the world my grief, My conquestâyou subservient. And, O breeze, That coveted my breath, to you I give My victor-cries, the waving of my garlands, The carriage of my music through the air. Evoe! Hence, hence, O Eagle! Fly, yea, fly! The wings stretch. . . . He is gone. Zeus welcome him! O terrible, strange Powers, That plotted for your prey, receive your lord. O solitude of rock and stream and fir, I stand erect amid my enemies, And draw them into sanctitude and faith, Making the woe-struck fir My chaplet, and the hungry rocks my haunt, The stream, the stream my anthem turbulent. I climb! The eagle in Olympus lights Beside my father's knee: the heaven receives My father's smile. The terrible still forest Breathes conquered. . . . If I climb into the snows, And through them where the unseen slopes descend, It may be there are vineyards, it may be Some streak of gay, gold leafage for my hair, Some grass, some noiseless waters: but I climb. THE GENETHLIACS OF WINE ROME and the Palace-gardens and October, And vintage on the trellises, great weight Of stony-massive clusters, drab and sober, Their purple screened in umbrage against Fate: Their leaves with hint of blood-stain on the tarnished Warm green of autumn and their tendrils dry. 'Tis vintage, and the trellises are garnished With wreathing limbs of vintagers, sky-high. Who catch and rend away and then drop under The mass of turbid grapes that on the ground Shoot out in light confession they are plunder Worth laughing to receive: a jewel-mound. And laughter breaks from boys and girls, commingled With children, baskets, tuns and stammel juice; A seething troop where nothing can be singled As coy to let the mirth-distraction loose. With hats of sunlit straw and garlands heavy Of branching vine-leaves and of clumps of fruit, The youths and maidens in an amorous bevy Their pile of grapes down in the presses shoot: Where crimson feet receive the rush, and splashes Of grape-must give to clowns the stain of war, As bunch on top of bunch, with melting flashes, The harvest runs to wine, the presses pour. While jests and toyings and wild untuned noises Love feasts on pertly nor will be appeased; The lads are satyrs and each girl that poises Her pannier on her head is rash and pleased. The Palace-gardens echo, for the revel Around the running vats and web of vines Is taken up with rapture from the level Of the great platform where the Palace shines. The sobbing cry that cleaves the grapes when trodden Dies round still feet; the vintagers are dumb: And from a bosomed heap of fruit half-sodden An infant cries . . . The mother does not come. She listens, as a chorus, mid its thunder, Star-spotted faun skins and slant ivy-staves, Its ribbon-fluttered drums, the hands that sunder On cymbal-clashes, down the garden raves. With hair afloat and wanton silks wide-flowing The Empress-harlot Messalina speeds The rout of Bacchanals, her forehead glowing Toward Silius, the enchanted youth she leads. There is unknown profaneness in her carriage: For mid soul-stricken witnessesâher lord Away at Ostiaâshe in open marriage Has knit to her the lover last adored. Her passion cried for vintage; she was weary Of lust unpunished, unwithstood excess. What was her love but dereliction dreary Without an end or pleasure's painfulness. She would be mad and smart with joy and tingle With ache of panic; she would clasp despair And win it death by dying; she would mingle A candour with a courage past compare. So she has claimed defiant by the altar To sanctify her paramour her own; To publish such desire as will not falter, Co-equal with her life-blood, with her throne. And now she feasts intractable, the sunny, Loud revel in her wake, her lover gripped Beside her, on his brow the sun like honey Spread flat, his mouth impassionate, red-lipped; His eyes a glory as when steel is flooded At battle-heat with noon; to right and left His golden-tressÃ¨d neck, dark ivy-hooded, Beats with the music as if sense-bereft. The husbandmen are scattered and their labour Is turned to sport by noble vintagers: Some dance upon the press with hoisted tabor, A dozen heap the ground with cumbering furs. The tumult of bare limbs and veils together Is like a whirl of doves above new seed: And one might doubt, who stood to listen, whether A cry could pierce the storm from brass and reed. But no one drains the vessels overrunning; The vat stands flooded and the soil drinks deep As old Silenus, while these Bacchants, shunning The ladders, pluck from lower vines that creep. The Empress dances: she has lost the measure Of mortal empire, and the heaven and earth Have added wings to freedom, wings to pleasure; A calm is made for dizziness of mirth. Young Silius, frantic, rocks his head, surrounded By arms that shake the castanets amain; While boyhood and his early youth confounded, As he were drowning, glide before his brain. The orgies at their heightâas fire is riven By wind in devious streams, so restlessly, With sudden panic from the concourse driven, One, Vettius, starts aside and climbs a tree. Then terror circles through the dance, an anguish Of limitless constraint; the pipes break off Upon a shriek, the whirr and triumph languish; Some dancers, struck with guilt, their badges doffâ Their panther-skin and garland: all would follow The climber's eyes; they shout, they wait, they yell; And he sees nothing save a distance hollow Of any sign that might disclose their spell. The tragic moments pause, as dead for token; Till to unblenching life each ear awakes, For Vettius from the turret-tree has spoken, And made the silence valid that he breaks. âIo, Io! I see a cloud.â The Empress ceases Her dance to laugh an echoing laugh and cry âWhat further portent?â âThe small cloud increases, It moves above the plain, benights the sky; âA cloud of dust.â Impatient of the story Their satyr-watchman tells, the maddest climb. âIt moves from OstiaââEvery face turns hoary. âIt will sweep on us in a little time. âThe Emperor leaves his sacrifice impassioned To strike our treason, aweless of his pride. That cloud is by his furious coming fashioned; His armed centurions through the country ride.â The Empress throbs, yet turns her eyes elated With desperation, a sweet rage, a charm Devoted on the eyes of him new-mated, Yet binds his neck with her remorseless arm. He wakes as children into youth must waken; Response is gold in eyes and smile; he finds Profusion where was nothing, and, unshaken By fear, his arm about her body winds. And now the turning spheres, the endless quiver Of tides and light are rivalled by these two That dance on threatened and sublime deliver Their perfect life to motion as a clue. All may behold their mystery; a stranger Would see that death alone could break their dance, And end engulf it; there could be no danger From interception nor discountenance: None, for the God of Vintage loves such lovers, The god whose sap is wine, who ripes for doom, Who in the transport of the year discovers Divinest mettle that exacts a tomb. They breathe to end their joy, they dance as fellows Of Spring, the ocean-waves, the stars, the rain, And of the movement of that zest that mellows The grape for autumn, cornlands for the wain. A blow! The Emperor's tribune strikes abhorrent The impious boy to earth, the Empress down On bursting grapes, that in her life-blood's torrent Lose all their started rivulets and drown. She sinks into the spume and plants a whiteness Deep in the ruddied clusters of her bed: And thus she sleeps a Bacchanal the brightness Of noon's impartial flame avouches dead. Then round her crowd the vintagers, returning A chorus to the field her passion trod: And over her magnificent, unspurning, Rests as her meed the harvest of their god. DE PROFUNDIS THE grey world of the dead is conqueredâall Its coolness, unconcern; its misty pall Of cavern-air, its sacred tripod-fumes Prophetic, all its sunken gems and metals, Its germs of plant and fruit and summer petals, Its laws that breed the world, its roots and tombs; Conquered! The shadows know it by their breath Warm on lip-ridges of the ice of death; They know it by the comfort in their eyes, And by the flute-like sympathies that waken Each pulse and vein, of music long-forsaken; They know it by a passion to arise: They lift themselves and move. They cannot see The spring-tide changing Disâthat cannot be, Where all is solemnnes of blindfold glades; They cannot see the spring, but in the hollow Unmirroring, vast, their feet are blessed and follow Some bent of beauty twilight overshades. And then the dusk grows blue across its web; The sable in the blue begins to ebb To pure sky-azure, and the ghosts sweep white As clouds of April: in the mighty clearness The gems and metals shake themselves and drearness Reels with their chequer. Pluto, there is light; And in the light thy Conqueror! He lies All love across a shadow's knee, his eyes Beneath her gaze as if he were a child; The budded vine-stems of his hair declining Down to her feet, his level body shining Under her bosom with the grave-clothes piled, His bloom of life surrendered to her arms: His mouth, soft, open for her kiss, embalms, Like crevice honey-filled, the air she draws. This youth that is her babe she looks on powerless To fondle him, for she has tasted hourless Duration of despair that slowly thaws. Then first across her brain the image dawns Of Thebes, her city, and those genial morns She parted from a god unseen as sleep; Till, by sore lust for seeing him o'ertaken, Fire swept her blind. And can her eyes awaken To look on joy and yet their vision keep? Can she at last behold her very son, Who might not see her god, or must she shun His grace divine of smile and laughing touch, That claim her from her cinder-desolation, That are her mighty lover's own creation Soliciting her eyes to feed, to clutch. Again flames spring in rage; they swell and smite Her orbs; there is jagged frenzy in her sight, That fails resplendent with its quick desire; But from the lightning-stroke her son has wielded Tears rain: the Mother, from her passion shielded, Weeps silently above the lightning's pyre. And thus she bows herself and seeks the mouth That never sought her breast: she stills her drowth With kisses . . . and the Dead refresh their love Beholding; all the coverts pulse and listen; The roots, a fringe round yellow corms that glisten, Drink rain in Hades for the spring above. Rose-tender mid the phantom's direful clothes, The child of Zeus and Semele still glows As sun throughout its morning to a height Of triumphâfor the phantom glows with rapture, And is the woman he has lived to capture For Heaven and Zeus and unforbidden sight. âMother, I knew thee when the nymphs bent down On Nysa's sward to touch me, and my frown Met their smooth finger-prints; at shadow-fall I sorrowed for thee, till I sought thee, lonely, Round olive-boles, believing thou wert only Warm-screened among them, hiding for my cry. âI knew thee when the lambs lay still and slept, A single tree above them: and I wept On summer banks to feel how firm it were To own thy comfort; I have never striven For joy but I was seeking thee, nor thriven Save for such hopes the want of thee would stir. âMother, when Ariadne smiled her smile Brought me this sun-glow on thy face. Awhile I triumphed over earth, the kings, the laws; Then old Silenus told me of thy story, Told me of Pluto's kingdom, deep and hoary, The thwarting rivers, the hound-guarded doors. âThrough coils of rock I reached the Stygian flood, That came as sodden snow upon my blood; But the black oarsman, dazzled, took his seat, Rowed and forgot he cleaves the flood for money; The hell-hound licked my hand as if for honey, The groves became aware and voiced my feet. âI broke a spell, and yet with no surprise The shadows raised their heads and gave me eyes Full of the earth and lenient. Hades' tomb With all it held took heed I sought my mother, Not spouse nor bond-maid, nay, nor any other Than she who bore me darkling in her womb. One tall grey form among the thousands more Drew me and owned me by the look it wore; Those veils would cling to me, the unseen face Be as my birth-star, holy, sure, and fateful. The shadow's solitude was cursed and hateful . . . A son was in thy arms' abiding-place.â âMy child, my love . . . My child! But thou canst speak; I cannot: my unfathomed want grows weak Before its bliss; and thou canst never hear What pain has called for thee, what sunk thanks-giving My dearth of thee yet made shouldst thou be living, The light upon thee, while my breast lay drear. âYou raise me from my ashes to the throne Of Zeus within the heavens: and not alone You take me past the star-sparks to my youth, But to my future also, to the lover No fearful vow, no fear, nor shame shall cover Away from worship eagle-eyed as truth. âLet us go hence, above; for at thy side There is no fire I may not now abide, No lightning and no deity.â The souls Pant with the sweeping motion through their valleys Of son and mother as they pass, like galleys Tide-borne, while severed Dis together rolls. The visit of the Conqueror fades away From each convinced recess: yet day by day The Dead are cheered of those who carry grapes, And smeared bold masks and flutes across the river, Who tell that Eleutherios is the giver Of these new pledges to the Stygian shapes. SYLVANUS CUPRESSIFER Et teneram a radice ferens, Sylvane, cupressum. Georg. I. A FOREST glade: a muffling sound of boughs, One ominous, sweet coo, small breaths about; And then a scowl, a doubt If sun will fall through to the moss again; Then floating on the floor a tide of wind. One fir-tree joint creaks, with a twang of pain, That lifts the feathers of the startled dove; While the green pathway has a sense that comes Not from rude shades above, Nor breezes with the pattering leaves behind, But from one coming as the robber comes. His little body, that can hardly serve To keep itself on goat-haired, swagging legs, Trembles and pauses, still and terrified From creeping on; the little hairy side Lifts with its terror: one hand stretched in span For solitude most desolately begs, The other hand lets drop with timorous swerve A plant so black it seems beneath day's ban. And straight I feel the wood-depths apprehend That I, of mortal race, shall hold him bond; Reluctantly they fear As when the thunder-rain is gathered near I see the flowers of wood-sage that before The light had hidden, plainly see one frond Of fern above all others twirl elate. . . . O panic! I could run; but hold the tighter This half-god creature, while the nutted floor Cracks with his strife against me, as I wait His peace, yea, wait till the dulled woods flash brighter From threatening end to end. A sunbeam grows: the butterflies are tilted Each toward the other through the amorous air; Wings speak of joy; wings, wings through every alley Unstartled now are up and down, or dally Or dance or pasture, but are everywhere. Gone is the panic as of daylight thunder, For he and I are reconciled, are still. Beneath the growing beam of sun his wonder Grew gentle: then a bird, whose every motion Had been a start while terror lay around, Rose from a holly-branch that trailed the ground, And from a topmost branch of holly lilted, With open dew-drenched bill. And we are friends, and I have led the creature I know divine to roots where we may sit, Have lifted from the track his sable plant, Have shaken it from fly and ant, And placed it in his hand that folds on it. Now first I see his eyes and then his face . . . The eyes where confidence itself is hidden, And all the other gentlenesses bidden To lurk before they spring in one dark blaze, Jump from their refuge to a stranger's heart: And in the sheltered countenance I trace No boorish sullenness, no churl disfeature, But through the shyness woe Of long ago. Crowsfeet and little wrinkles weave their maze Under the squills and birch-twigs of his crown, And yet his front is simple with no frown; And the lips, soft as women's, fall apart. I woo his voice: words tread upon its tone As feet on spines and moss of fragrant pile; And on his mouth the fir-seed as he chews Moves glidingly or drops or clings awhile: He snaps a fly and now and then will muse Till all the wood deep through is quiet as stone. Yet hour by hour I learn from him his story, For I have loved the woods and I may hear; And I can listen till the pines are hoary With eve and surgent moonlight and the dew. He tells me he is Sylvanâand a fear Booms from the doves' nestâhow he once loved dearly Young Cyparissus of the lovely locks; How sweet the boy was in his eyes, how clearly He was more godlike than the starry flocks, Though bred on Earth and they withheld above. He tells of the boy's love For one red fawn, of how that shaggy head Lay on the brilliant side, a spot of shade, And his white arms clung tight, Strained to the beast at noontide and at night; Of how he watched it feed and as it fed Enjoyed it and its appetite. Ah, never Could Sylvan win the fair boy's fellowship Unless that ruddy fawn were close or lying At rest or softly sighing Where scarce a breadth of shaded turf might sever; And all the while from Cyparissus' lip Bubbled a language chosen for his pet, More tender than the tenderest human phrase He used to Sylvan in the dear sunset When they were close at heart in the last rays. He tells of how, one August afternoon, Wandering apart from the fantastic lad, He shot the forest deer, And ate the ivory filberts as a boon, And drank the stream from its brown shelves, And lay, as hunters loose on leaves and glad To cool themselves; And how, while lying thus, he chanced to hear A movement through the deeps of fern, and shot. Ah, had he not! He would have died to gather back that dart: A cry went through the tree-tops, through his heart: And in a dimple of the level fern A well of darkness had been sunk and there He found the boy he loved who would not turn His face away from what was stretched below; And Sylvan saw a rim of ruddy glow, And knew what he had done and shuddered with despair. And well he might despair: for on the sun Cool evening breathed, yet Cyparissus lay; And night entrenched itself among the pines, Then waited, then made sortie and then won The dales and chases from the green of day, Yet still he gave no signs, No comfort, no forgiveness to the grief That moaned beside his form, with no relief Of tears, though dew was on the cloakless cheek. Space filled with doom; leaves turned and slept once more; A fruit fell . . . and Sylvanus strove to speak, But something smothered every sound before He spoke: and then the strong adjacent wild Was blown across . . . and loneliness was made For Sylvan evermore through bourn and glade. At dawn he saw the stately firs were fresh With shower, he heard them sigh. The fir-pricks fell, the fir-boughs spread their mesh Of foliage for laments from age to age; While voiceless sorrow that could only die Was huddled at his feet. He would assuage At least the cold restriction of that wrong: And at his word a funeral tree arose Where Cyparissus lay, and there was song Full through the tree and freedom of its woes. Poor Sylvan heard; he saw the mourning fir Rise up instead of that soft-greeting boy He loved so well; He heard its music swell With piteous plaint, and then he heard the joy He had in love been powerful to confer. He wept, he cried aloud, he bathed his hands With weeping, and he came and broke some strands Of foliage, that his sorrow might be able To touch with lover's touch its misery. Then the sun smote him; day received the tree, And Sylvan wandered with his branches sable. I listened to this story hours by hours, While butterflies approached their fans to flowers; While the green woodpecker was gliding hither And thither 'mid the crannies of his bark; While jays shook sky-ribbed feathers with a jeer, And seeds or leaves or insects in the dark Of silent shadows crackled far or near. At last we parted; and I knelt to win The drear serenity his blessing shed. I saw his swagging goat-hoofs pass within A bowery path that slanted round his head, And covered him away. O Sylvan, I have known your lore, your sway, O mcurner of obscure and unhoused death, That reeks up from the balm Of fallen leaves, of falling autumn fern, At instants, through the fresh woods, on their breath, I too have known, O little, gentle King, Your comfortingâ To hear a sorrow of all sorrows sing: And I as you can turn With measured feet afar where boughs are calm. THE CHILDHOOD OF ZEUS âTHOU of the Ã¦gis, of Dodona's oaks And doves oracular, whose eagle bears Thy thunder on his neck and in his claw Thy lightning-truss; thou to whom Ãtna flares Praise of thy lightning, while its summit smokes, Zeus, by what law Wert thou enabled, Shining One, to be To gods and earth and men the final Majesty?â I cried out toward the clouds: but I was taught All unawares by an old man whose brow Tilted a chaplet-vine o'er joyous cheeks, Ripe round the potent eyes. He pushed a bough Aside, and laughed âWhat riddle pains thy thought? To him who seeks Strange knowledge, I impart it. Thou shalt know What thou are fain to ask, and I am here to show.â âWhy is Zeus lord of gods and earth and men?â Silenus drew me to an oak-tree's root: He taught me in a language like a song, And on his lip his breathing was a flute. He bade me from Olympus turn my ken, Where Zeus among The lighted faces sits in light complete, And through the lower sky descend to hilly Crete. There once I might have seen a child in shade Of round-scooped oak-leaves burst on by a beam; And as the brightness wandered he would watch Until he grew gold-smiling at the gleam; And he would thump the moss where he was laid, Or grasp a notch Of rooty trunk or mid its fibres creep, While tier on tier above the tent of leaves hung deep. There through the hours he listened to the song Of the wreathed sky above him, heard the hush When dew was on the foliage, dew of eve And morning, heard the wind and oak-leaves brush, In summer and when autumn swept along; Or firmer weave An anthem airy, sibilant, assured, As though from elder days it had in peace endured. To him it was but lullaby: he slept And dreamed as dreams a god when fresh to earthâ For all his vision was of future time. And near him crouched the goat that from his birth Had nurtured him with tawny milk and kept The mountain rime From chilling him, a nurse of rudest love, With dugs from which he drew sap of the leaves above. He waxed in primal vigour, cool and proud; The woods had wondrous thoughts of him, the beasts Made him their vigil and of stealthy choice They haunted him; the eagle from its feasts Sailed to nod over him; a steadfast crowd, The doves gave voice To themes for which nor breeze nor leaves had scopeâ The motions of their heart in dread at some dear hope. Once on the forest's rim of boughs and scrub He paused and saw the sun's wide prevalence, And felt the ease with which it spread its power, Yet felt more affluent; and, going thence, Deep to the holy lawns mid tree and shrub In tangled flower, He thought with open thought upon the sun, And knew not how, yet knew it had through him begun. He gathered up his fist upon his heartâ Why did it close as by a sceptre filled? Why did he hear all sounds as if they drew His breath? And why was every silence thrilled With pain he smothered of excessive smart? The wood he knew Became an unknown kingdom to his youth; And happiness trod harsh upon his silent ruth. With absent hand he seized some boughs of oak And ground them each on each with careless heat, His mind absorbed in generous magnitude Of vague ambition. Lo, he checks his feet At flash of miracle! The boughs he broke In sullen mood Have darted sunshine and the secret light That fed the sun leaps rustling on his sight. He has awakened of his force alone That which awakes all life; his brow is great With joy that is the ripeness of sweet forms, The beating colour that makes day elate: Wide sweeps the brilliance that he hails his own, His beauty warms, And clear to view he stands beneath his oaks, An image that the world down every path invokes. He nursed that fire with twig and withered leaf; A wind assumed it as its ownâit spread: Then suddenly it swooned and where it waved Nothing was left but void that it was dead, And marvel that such visit was so brief. But the boy braved All fear, and wrought again that oaken spark, And let it pass, and then roamed on through alleys dark. He comes to the lone nursery of his lire, The midmost oak-grove of the mighty groves; The sun in sparkles like the dragon-fly's Winged sparkle strays on the mid-bole he loves, His cradle once: he stands, a tortured strife Fixed in his eyes; Then gentleness falls over him once more, But keener than he showed on any day of yore. He twists his fingers in the shaggy coat Of Amalthea, she that nursed so well His infancy; bends over her and bids In sudden glowing whisper a farewell: Then leaves her swiftâthat solitary goat; And on his lids Dew rises to remember how she lies Mid flecked and flecking oaks with white, untroubled eyes. A filial yearning after her he sends, As he must grasp her shaggy hair or die; Yet hurries on inveterately hot: The wing-stroke of a dove as he draws nigh To the brisk covert, where the forest ends In bushy plot, Is like the pulse in him that backward beats To those dense inmost shades from which his step retreats. And thus he left his forest-home behindâ Green guardian of his strength, the sanctuary Of his prevailing secretâfar and wide Wrought deeds of revelation none might see With bosom imperturbable, or mind Unglorified, For of those many wonders that he wrought All owned the sudden flame with which he ruled and fought. He drew from threatening woods that jet of fire, And cast it at the giantsâthey fell, they moaned: He reached Olympus, and the gods of Time, Grey instantly and shrunk with terror, owned The advent of their end, their lighted pyre: With glow sublime He bent o'er field and sea, and hymns were sung, And gods and earth and men rejoiced that god was young. He looked upon the low shores of the world And saw how beast and herb and flower increased Beneath his day; and with full voice he bade Necessity weave various forms of beast And herb and flower upon the cloak unfurled Of her, and laid Round knee and shoulder as his sovereign guise. Then once more toward the earth he swept immortal eyes. The goat was dead that fostered him of old, But still lay fresh upon the acorn-sod. He raised her faithful being as a star To argent softness, she that nursed a god In solitude, through menaces untold: No gulfs debar Their converse, their fond interchange on high; She shares his kingdom now, fast-tethered to the sky. But of her dearly-loved, rude skin he makes The buckler of his godhead, for he knows Her sappy milk and her maternal cares Formed him his awful presence to his foes, Gave him that dark solemnity that shakes A host nor spares Till vanquished feet such panic-dread confess As strikes down from the leaves of woodland wilderness. He has his Ã¦gis: from the cliffs in air He calls the watchful eagle to his knee, And lays a thunder, as of virgin woods In which he hides his fire abysmally, On the portentous wings and forehead bare; The shade that hoods The fire-filled branches of his sacred oaks Shall murmur in its cloud above his lightning-strokes. And since an oak-grove cherished him and told Its secret and his glory to his youth, To it he will impart his Voice, his word, His inmost ponderings, his breathÃ¨d Truth To wander through the boughs of vocal gold, By breezes stirred; And doves through hollows of the leafy wood Musing shall bring forth sounds by prophets understood. Thus Zeus is lord of gods and earth and men: For the old forest set its heart on him, And drew from him his voice as he had drawn From it the fire of life in ages dim, When first he ruled athwart the heaven's span, In the far dawn Of younger, happier worship than had been Till golden oaks avowed the flame beneath their screen. CAENIS CAENEUS YEA, from the sea she won her will, From Neptune of the restless waves, The changeful channels and unfathomed caves: By Neptune she had stood and prayed He would her fickle need fulfil, Give her a solace unessayed, And let her life be altered to the core, Dissevering it from what had been before. He heard across his billows' fret Her dear petition haunt his foam, And echo down the waters of his home. He climbed his carâit spouted brine; And bannered with sea-ribbons wet, His dolphins 'mid their issuing shine, Paw in the daylight, and disclose their King, Propitious to the maid's petitioning. He heard her discontent make moan Even as the ocean round his wheels Itself will voice impatience when it feels To yearn for alteration, yearn For other being than its own, And other tides to flow and turn, And other shores and streams, and gulfs and bays, For any end at last to weary days. He loves to see her urgent face, 'Mid banners and 'mid ribbons wet Of floating tresses the foam-bubbles set; So covetous to have its prayer: He loves to find it in that place, To meet such lips and eyes as dare Press for a mercy that the sea in vain Cries after in fatigue nor may attain. His realm for ever he would lose If he could give dejected waves The new existence that his ocean craves: But he will grant this maiden's hope, And let her reach, as she would choose, Her goal of wellnigh impious scope, She shall be changedâa very change be wrought, And she become a man in form and thought. For so she prayed, and so he heard, And looked on herâwith billow-crest Bowed on her little foot and splashed her breast; While from his head of mounded snow His azure-netted veil he stirred, That his compliance he might show To the fair woman the last time she prayed: Then toward her with magnificence he swayed. Close in a mist he shut her round, And with a voice that drew its tone From welling deeps of prevalence unknown He rent her soul away, he breathed A valiant breath . . . The mist unwound; And, turning, with his veil he wreathed His hoary mound of hair and waved adieu Light-fingered to the youth that stood in view. The shore was desolate, the boy Saw the curled dolphin-tails divide A coming wave and in blue fathoms hide: Then turned to scan the cliff that rose Up to the land. A curious joy Hath made him to himself propose The conquest of that overhanging height, That faces him with challenge of its light. He climbed, he feasted on the air Drawn up from seaward by the rock; He circled many a precipice and block, Discovered, rifled in their holes The sea-birds' nests, while everywhere He started birds to veer in shoals, And reached the grasses, shivering with nods, High on the summit's scarcely-woven clods. Affrighting was the silence high; He felt no fright, he knew no pain In treading over the unpeopled plain; Sureness was on his nerve, his heart; The tang of fern as he passed by, The herd of deer, their eager start, Their bound and their alluring eyes on him Roused up the hunter's lust in every limb. He wanted but the dart to slay: So chased the fleeting creatures wide, And breathless came where countryfolk abide. A stranger, on the grass he laughed And ate with them at close of day, And of their liberal vintage quaffed. He had no tales to tell, but they were bred To chat in legend while they drank and fed. It came to pass that Caeneus won Men's praises when along the street Or market-place he trod with buskin'd feet; Though oft he strove with them in fight And would no chance of quarrel shun, Yet never was his piercing might Struck down nor staggered by the rival's blow, Nor any wound delivered by a foe. Fame gave him of her noblest sportâ He hunted the Arcadian boar, Across the forest heard its whining roar, And stood beside its spiny heap; He sailed on Argo from the port Of fell Iolchus to the deep Sicilian seas, and many wonders met, And loved the sea he never might forget. For when upon the sea, he felt, As he beheld it fall and climb, Misgivings, intimation of a time Before he lived a man as now: Against the vessel's side he knelt, Or stood apart upon the prow, And thought, till ever-baffled in his quest, He put the strange, unguarded thought to rest. Though when it came to him it charmed, It harrowed him and made him reel With sense of things too far away to feel: And then he joined the sailor-throng, For from that trance he woke alarmed; Yea, ample-throated sang their song, But with his eyes still on the fluent bars Of sunny foam or grey beneath the stars. And when on shore he passed a maid Who tangled flowers about her hair, She caught stray smiles, a question in the stare That Caeneus fastened on her coil; And by the bridges he delayed To see the washers at their toil; And when he wooed the girl whom he would kiss Oft deemed he shared her shrinking from her bliss. And so he loved and sailed and sang, And fought in battle with his peers, And laboured for his joy through glorious years; Till at Pirithous' marriage-feast The fair Thessalian meadows rang With fratricidal war, increased By fumes of wine, as flashing Centaurs strove To rape the women whom the Lapiths love. There Caeneus roused him 'gainst the crew Of ravishers, a mortal fight. The cunning Centaurs weighed his wound-proof might, And came on him with forest trees, Rent and uprooted, that they threw In masses, with gigantic ease, Against the hapless warrior buried deep By firs and oak-trees in a funeral heap. Crushed down, he fainted in the sod, Immovable, but living long Without a sigh through the hot summer day: His victors, who had wrought such doom, Far over other valleys trod, And left him proudly in his tomb; Nor did they watch how through the trees amassed Above their foe a bird, the Caenis, passed. Then a fresh life began in air And on the wing and in the tree: Song, when the Spring was striking sunnily Deep to the greenwood's heart-felt green; Rest, when the night was everywhere, And leaves for warmth and not for screen Were blindly sought; and feasting, when the day Touched into laughter dews that crept away. The little space of wingÃ¨d time Soon ended, and a nipping frost, That over the black woodland crossed, Laid low the Caenis-bird in death; Still were the feet that loved to climb The topmost bough, and cold the breath That made aloud their music for the flowers, And note on note more sweet o'erbrimmed the hours. Thus earth is left behind at last, And Hades covers in a soul That nevermore will follow any goal; The world of judgment is her home, And here the lives that she has passed Under the sky's tremendous dome The maiden Caenis in her narrow days Must ponder on, dividing blame or praise. âAnd I am Caenis: once again Her life of shadow I resume, Closed in by walls and by prevailing doom, Unable with my hand or will The dreaming in me to attain, Or any impulse to fulfil. O ghost, thou art the Caenis thou wert born, And Hades is thy fitting house forlorn. âWell that I once could breast the sea And lure from it the gift of change! My maiden life could win no valid range, Aye waiting impotent to win; But with my manhood's sovereignty I struck where woman's hopes begin: The world was in each plan, in every deed; Mine was the doing: for the rest no heed. âGod of the sea, I loved my life Should leaven earth; I loved the heat, The calm events, the merrymaking meet For triumph and the ease of choice: Then all was possible to strife, And every moment might rejoice In what it bred of its affiance high; While every moment pushed the zest to die.â So she bemoans herself and weeps Her spectral days and bends her sight On heroes as they strive in spectral fight. The vanity of all she sees Or faintness on her sorrow sweeps, For with a sudden run she flees To a dark wood no tremble ever stirred, And there she sobs âAh, would I were a bird!â SIRENUSAE âLAND!â: from the helm was called at dawn. A mystic dome, a silver mound, Stood in the sea beneath the morn. Between the summit and deep sound A haze of polished silver lay. Sea at the helmâand far away That mountain silver and alone: No land beside, Save what must hide Behind the vapour's glittering zone. And Argo, since the wind was fair, Lowered all sail, and, poles sail-bare, She ran the waves toward land, toward land. But suddenly a lower strand Burst forth beneath the silver hill, As the sun burnt away the haze; And, sundered from its polished screen, The lower island seemed ablaze With green that could not drain its fill Of light, it lay thereâoh, so green! What voice is this, what startling charm Upon the surge, upon the ear? It comes, by its own coming dear; The porpoise listening takes alarm Of joy and leaps within the swell; The birds more shy wheel round in spell. That ominous delight awakes All memory to awful day; And chains desire and bids it stay With pulses that no lust forsakes. It is as sweet as blood that sings Around the heart that nears its dream. A voice of voices past that seem To laugh and cry and tell of things They told to listeners far away. The land-clouds melt, the Argo swift Ranges ahead, the shores are clear, The song more ardent in its drift Of lasting sweetness, floated near . . . And who are those upon the grass, The sea below their slanted rocks, Who fix wide eyes on all that pass, And lift their solemn irised locks Up from damp shoulders, slung with plumes? What scales are those the diamond-blink Of adamantine rock illumes? And is the song their songâthose three, Who flap with harps on yonder brink, And make a sleep with rich monotony? They sing of ease that by its might Will lull the sailor: he will think Of ships and watch the constellations go Upon their voyage round the starlit night; But he will know That he is safe becalmed and cannot sink, Save on a bosom patient for his rest. They sing such pleasure is of pleasures best: Then sing of gold and how it shines, How they will lead the seeker down To fathomless, resplendent mines. They sing of great ambition set By them, in wisdom, on a crown: They sing of leisure to forget All save the roses as they move Their buds out into hymning flowers: They sing of indolence and hours Of wealth and empire, dreams and love. Then Jason to the steersman at the helm Shrieked he should turn the vessel from the shore. âThe Sirens strive to overwhelm Our sense with slumber as a frost: Turn, turn the helm or we are lost, And build their nest of bones for evermore.â The music drew the helm, the song Drew the race-currents to its stress, Drew mariners and sea along. Ligea lays her hand upon a bone, And smiles a pearl-smile's softest loveliness; Parthenope, more cautious witch, has thrown Across her scales and the white lime of men Her feathery garland, while she wings Her voice with softness from her den: Leucosia bares her breast and softly sings, While to her lip the surf of hunger clings. Then Jason shrieks once moreâhimself Beneath that murdering music numbâ âLet Orpheus face the rocky shelf, And drown the noise: let Orpheus come.â He came, he sat before the three, He faced the ruinous delight, And struck his harp across his knee, And sang with unconfuted sight. âO Zeus, of Thee my song, of all Thou art to mortals in their youth, To mortals when their years appal, And Thou dost teach their memory truth: Of Thee my song, of Thee, of those Beside Thee in Thy rule above, The gods who give our pain repose, Who fill the forests that we love, The fountains that we drink for life, The fields that gird us with their food, The fiery soil with vineyards rife, The soil that breeds the olive-wood. I sing their influence, clean in gift, Their joys I sing, their buoyancy Beneath the hands of Zeus that lift The worlds, yea, raise them to their place. I sing the powers of hill and sea, Of sun and rain-cloudâsing the race Of men who worship them, and deem They have a faithfulness, a worth Of hallowed claim on every age: I sing those ages' constant stream, The noble sepulchres of earthâ Their holy dust, our heritage Of their great sway in deed and choice. I sing of legendâI rejoice In ancient pith and spirit warm. I sing of those that not alone Will live, but seek some precious form, Beloved with pulse a star might own: I sing of lustrousness, of health, Of will that shapes with looming stealth, Of riches a King's hand must spend, Of battle and the hero's end, Of labour and its craft, its speed. I sing of song that hath its meed From breathing earth and sacred grove, From gods and men the gods approve. Down in the sea's depth with wild arms The sirens plungeâno more to riseâ Plunge as though drowned asleep by charms Surpassed, they vanish, blue and drear: Their music stays awhile and dies But tardily from wave and ear: And Orpheus as he listens sighs. Sad is the crew to mark those cries Of volant sweetness lose their breath: The empty cliff attests of death; The helm is turned and Argo flies. THE HEART OF AN ISLAND WHY such radiance, why such showers, Not of rain but heavenly rays; Why such glory as empowers Earth to breed, in tilth and wild, Wreathing roses, petal-piled, Of indelible, red blaze? Why these lilies on the waste, In the gardens by the streams, Each with score of flowers enchased On the whitest grain of light; Clouds of honey from their white Filling air with hiving dreams? O'er the ocean-isle of Rhodes Why this panoply of cloud? Why this purple screen that loads Sunset, when the day as yet With its noon has scarcely met? Why this secret, western shroud? Why? Oh, hush! What twain are these? Venus and the Sun are laid 'Neath the solemn canopies, 'Mid the rose and lily hosts Of those erubescent coasts, In the island's loneliest glade. THE RITUAL OF EARTH ONCE in Aegira, on its headlong hills, That Crathis girds with billow fed by Styx, That ocean worships from the portâyea, fills With brine the air that tops their summits, licks Their sudden old declivitiesâof yore The earth had there a temple and there spoke Her prophecies that breathed in her before Another shape had origin or woke From out all-powerful Chaos, cold and stark. A priestess kept the Temple and the cave Where the first voice made language in the dark, As on the earliest-moving, moulded wave: A priestess chaste as stalactite, and doomed, Before her virgin steps might be entombed Within that nether cell, to drink a draught Of fresh blood from a bull, and, having quaffed, Descend to listen, cloyed with vital power, With lips as purple as a victim's heart, And inspiration a salt fume, a dower Of vigour, slaughtered that it might impart Its tides in death to continence. So fed, And so inculpable she reached the voice, The earliest lifted from the strident bed Of Chaos with its immemorial noise. O Earth, first of all deities, to whom Oaths and not prayers are vowed, how shall we reach, Even we, thy cloudy oracles, the tomb From whence, in thy precedence thou dost teach Initiatory lore? First-fruit of birth, And Mother therefore of all creatures, Earth, We too would listen, stalwart, to thy gloom. âYe do not drink my sacrifice, and none Come with inviolate spirit to my cell. But if perchance one needs me, such an one Must seek me in deep forests under spell Of tracklessness, for there his lips may drain My power's severity, if sweet yet rude, That rises from the tufts enlarged by rain, From moss and fern, hot with my plenitude. This let him drink: I will remit the draught Of fresh blood from a bull my priestess quaffed. Drink this for inspiration and to test The freshness of thy being. If thy breast Heave with assurance and clean lustihood It may be thou wilt hear through the dim wood A murmur: if thy pulses are contained, Intact from luxury or evil flaw, The moment of thy quest may be attained, For then the murmur to a voice will draw Its mysteries of sound, and thou shalt hear What Chaos through its boom first heard with fear.â HYLAE YOU to whom Time is cruel, striking down The force of life with blow of year by year, To Hylae come, where Phocian mountains brown Break into stony valleys far and near About Apollo's shrine: Worship his image on the shrineâfrom thence Strength will invade you, ageless and divine, That owns no stay, that suffers no offence. What men are those edging yon precipice, That stand among the firs bold-spirited, And careless of abysses that entice The weak to frenzied downfall of mere dread? See how they move and sway Among the firs, and from the firs leap sheer, Like fallen trees sprung from the axe away, Yet every jag and pinnacle they clear. As if the cliff were but a step to leap They reach the ground beneath with planted feet; They pause unshattered and then nimbly keep Their motion through rock-roses and the sweet, Stretched rugs of blazing thyme; For they have sought at Hylae's village fane A superhuman might, and if they climb Descend as visiting gods the earth attain. And out of forest-mould huge oaks are heaved, Their moss in flakes, the streaming ivy torn, And on the shoulders of the athletes sheaved Are upward to the walls of mountain borne Across defiles. Ah, see, Against the great escarpment of the West How lines of men and trees triumphantly Pass black upon the vapours of the crest. There is a might Apollo can bestow To conquer mountains in a mountain-land. And not at Delphi on the slopes below We ask thy counsel, touch thee with the hand, But here where life is hard, Where heights lift far away from us the sky, Where we must walk round boulder or on shard, We hug thy village-altars lest we die. DELPHICA O PILGRIM from the South, You ask for sudden prophecy From this my mouth, As if my god were near me at your cry. Behold yon laurel-tree In every span of leaf a sun; The whiteness, see, That the impenetrable green hath won. From off this laurel-branch The thick leaves that I pluck away My teeth must graunch, Before I can be told what I shall say. Yea, I must take and eat My god's own bracing laurel, find Its substance sweet To flesh and blood, ere I unveil my mind. But even then, if fed On Delphicus, and having savoured well, With inmost dread Corporeal the body of his spell, Unless your victim shake Before me, as august with god, I cannot take The darkness from my brain, the mortal clod. O Prince, be taught That inspiration in the nourished blood By heaven is wrought, And must by votive awe be understood. PART II MEMNONIDES CHILD of my husband's age and my young hope, I see thee, Memnon, on the serried heap Of funeral wood, dark-stained with wine and strewn As a king's wharfe, with storax and soft gumsâ My dusk, strong son, now heavy-dead and small, Within thy purple hair and purple robe, Almost as if thou wert the child I kissed With my fond light those olden morning-times And hours of evening when I took thy kiss. For thou hast loved me: rarely is the voice Of music in a mother's heart returned From nursery or the school or white-spread camp With equal echo; but I heard thy love When thou didst speak to me and heard it not In any of thy tones for other ears. O voiceless, little image of my son, Laid stiff across my sight, how shall I bear Immortally the unresponsive hours, Now thou hast closed thy lips and sealed thy heart, O inconversible by word or sign, A surdity to all I have been, am, And ever shall be since thy first of cries. I saw thee strive; I saw Achilles strive; I watched, as stars the heaving plain of waves, The swaying balance in the hand of Zeus, Unsteadfast with the fate of each that fought; Saw how thy fate wavered irresolute, Till it flew up and struck me into swoon. I woke to nothing but the dew of tears I wept on thy fresh dying, wept unstayed. Thou wert not dead as stone, because thy smile And my sore tears together gleamed one eve, One morn: and then I wept within my cloak, For thou wert stone, for thou wert dead indeed, And hastening men toiled hot to build thy pyre. Now while my tears are ice behind my lids, Ice that in fever of the brow remains, I can but watch the Trojans hang thy arms To blazon from the pile the conquering fire; But watch the little service of mankind, As keepsakes are remembered in thy tent, Brought out and set around thy body. Zeus, I am not mortal; I can lay no pledge On his spread breast; I cannot rear the shield Or sword he grasped and mottled with his death; I cannot bring the beasts with leaf-hung throat To bleed for him: yet I must sacrifice, Must make propitiation for my son. Lord Zeus, have mercy! Yield me some response, Yield me some emblem of a mortal grief, That I too may have dressed in part his couch Before it lapses through the fire to ash. See, it is lighted . . . Zeus, I pray, I pray! I smell the offering of the Trojan host, A trail of luscious nurture for the airs Of all the West; and now the flames stab fine, Redden and darken, and the thawing mass Begins to drop as the blaze opens out To heaven. O Zeus! . . . From where the hollow reeks With basking wine and gums that simmer slow, What is it flies aloft and does not fall, As any fragment of the burning heap, But soars a fire? Nay, nay, 'tis song I hear, 'Tis glitter of a pinion that I seeâ A bird! His spirit sings me back my love, And wheeling, gives me range who have been bound. His spirit! And, behold, from forth the pile Troops of swift birds escape, like sparks to air, Divide their flocks embattled, meet and slay, Till all are slain and fall a sacrifice Down from the sky and whelm the seething planks With passionate descent, as if I threw The immolated fliers on the blaze. Thanks be to Zeus! For he hath given the Soul Of him I bore a voice, and he hath turned My dire regrets to victims, winged and wild, That have been dashed in holocaust athwart The hungry planks of the funereal fire. It sinks; and now is white upon the sand, White as a sheep-skin: and I hear the waves Breaking aslant down all the shores of Troy. ODE TO DAWN I BREATHE: the cloud below the night is breaking; The air uncloses: Thou risest from thy couch. O Dawn, thy waking Is that of roses! Thou child of Titan, how thy power prevails! One sister hand touches the Moon that sails Away, that sinks; one greets the Sun, withheld By the chill shadows thou art brave against. What may not by thy buoyant cheer be quelled Of dominance by which thou art incensed? O Dawn so wondrous bright, Thou canst by force of thy salubrity, From heaven's own height, Compass thy will in heaven and earth and sea. Thou art immortal, and thine eyes immortal Rest on the ocean, The shore, the groves, the temple's open portal, On new-tuned motion Of animals refreshed by sleep and dream, On birds, and field and flock and starting team, As if they were immortalâon the youth That girt for toil or journey in thy gaze Receives his immortality for truth, And lifts to thee an almost stifled praise, Thou bracest so his heart. Yea, the whole burnished land, as if eterne In every part, Doth toward thy face with equal glitter yearn. And yearningly thou in thy course dost linger, With gracious boldness, O'er Cephalus laid sleeping, and thy finger, A rose-bud coldness, Startles and pricks him till the boy awakes, Who, smiled at from thine honest eyes, forgets His first sigh for his Procris: to thy car Thou dost constrain him captive, and with speed, Beyond the lark-glint and the morning-star, Discouraging the heaven with thy deed, Thou and thy coursers glow, On toward Olympus where thou facest all The wise gods know, Nor can their congregated eyes appal. Thy chastity is in thy will, thy beauty Is eager flushing. On him thou lov'st thou layest as love's duty, (All terror hushing) From earth steeply to travel at thy side, Till by adventure he be deified. Not Cephalus alone, Orion too, And young Tithonus thou hast borne above. No matter should the mortal prove untrue, And pine in stupor for an earthly love, Or hurled down from the sky Be sunk in waves, or 'mid the heavenly born See Age draw nigh To snow upon a single head forlorn. It is thy impulse of inviolate willing Stirs glade and mountain. The nests in arbour, birds beside the rilling Of forest fountain, The wood-flowers and the stream-flowers and all things Would drive aloft with thee. Ah, thou hast wings! Most lovable, forget not what thou art: Thou drawest us to thee, to heaven amain. Intrepid dreamers, to the clouds we start, And smile with thee along, with thee attain The gods, the placid Throne; Then 'mid the hollow vapours of the way We wake alone, O rose-hung Queen of steedsâand, lo, 'tis day. Spare thou the flowers! Let not their discs be flattered With lofty dreaming Of Hera's bosom and her pavement scattered With their first beaming: Let not the birds tune for Apollo's thanks Where, voicing heaven, he crowds the happier banks. Vain prayer! Most merciless of visions, shown Too often to thy victims, yet so fresh That never as a custom may we own Thy presence, but are dazzled in thy mesh And suffer thy strong goad; Deluded, brilliant with each new daybreak, Thy chiming road, Even to the end, we and our world must take. CIRCE AT CIRCAEUM HOW may the drooping poppy-leaf abide Wreathed in the bladder-weeds Athwart the tide? Whose are the white-robed, whiter-shadowed limbs Within the shaggy rims Of the shore's last rock-pool? O Circe, Circe! Is there hope or woe Can bring her to a mirror set so low? Deep into it the shadowed poppy bleeds, Mid crabs and fishes cool, The poppy on her forehead: and she cooes Across the shallows; toward the deeper sea, As out from woods; her lips above the swing Of little tide-tracks have a freshet's spring Of smiles for the vast glitter of the brine. O Circe, Circe! Do not sorely pine For answer to thy call, For answer to thy smiles: It is the slow noontide that bindeth all, Beguiling further than thy charm beguiles. Her breath removes from lips to her still heart; No covert in the foldings of a hill Was ever from all breeze so greatly still As she with waiting: and, their lids apart, As lakes that never look from off the sky, Her eyes are on the sea. Thus noon goes by. O Circe, Circe, wake, arouse thy magic! The poppy-bud now dribbles from its drop Through the rock-pool, nor will its flowing stop; Shadows from the heaven breast the sea; The hour is tempered to thy potency. She breathes as if the rustling ferns set free The evening dew; she looses from her bosom A trail of jasmine-flower; her breathing stirs All that bees ravish from auriculas Of drugged, delicious, smothering meal; she closes With tremor to the shadowy breeze her lids, And lets her sweetness overlap the salt. What coldness in the ocean-ooze forbids A lover to attempt such rare assault? The ripples crease her mirror; from its bed No spasm-waves in coiling current spread From sudden pressure. Are the sea-gods dead? O suppliant by the sea, are spells in vain? She rises and a cloud of summer rain Washes the wave-tips as it washed green leaves, Dashes its dew to sea-spray, nestling cleaves Soft to the barren eddies in their lapse; And with its beauty and its shower enwraps The churning bubbles in a rainbow clear. O Circe, Circe! A King died beneath The poison of thine anger that is death: Thy weariness recoils on doting Kings, And they turn brutish in their wallowings. Her rain is gathered in, and the blank sea Receives a shadow cast immovably. As thunder rolls along through mountain-glens, Her eyes and lips and nostrils, as from dens, Give forth their curse. A budded stalk among The poppies on her forehead reareth strong, No bud-head, but a serpent that by fits The sea-gust and the sea-shine madly hits With fork on fork, until one moment grows An imprecation: âGlaucus, thou hast braved All charms I bring from earth: await its ban. Thou liest on a breast that is my foe's! Not by thy closest love shall she be saved.â Ocean heard dumbly. There was poppy-seed Scumming the streamers of the bladder-weed, Where poppy-flowers had vanished from the glass. No one would come out seaward till at dawn The maiden Scylla to the pool would pass Across the reefs and bathe amid that spawn Of steeping poppy-seeds. At dead of night The waves howled once or twice: but day dawned bright. APPLE-BOUGH AND DEER THE night is come and Night's tranquillity: Now is the volume of her darkness stable, Possessing land and air but not the Sea. The Sea is stronger than the Night, and able To bring back to her heart a lover's reign. They lie together and their past attain, As man and woman wedded long ago. For she in virgin youth was drawn below The secret canopy of stretching waves By ocean, in a kiss that drowns and saves From death at very last of its control. And she remembers yet the billow's roll Above her maiden strife, as she was held Remorselessly, to depths of love compelled; Lost, but how cherished, in unfathomed caves. And that old passion broods between the two. Soon as the bat moves round an air of dew, Night and the Ocean meet in confidence, While earth is but a darksome mass more dense Than darkness overhead: but on the Sea There lies pale love at watch immutably For the whole heaven of Night; while she bows down To meet those kisses that she knows half-drown. Beside the Ocean, underneath the Night, A shore is washed by waves and full moonlight. See, how it stretches! Who is on that shoreâ With furled great wings, furled as for evermore; Solemn as Night and faithful as the Sea, A woman with her wings as tall as she, Her hand around an apple-bough, in flower With milky, tangled stars of spring's prime power; And, circling, lightly set upon her head, A diadem wrought of fast-running deer, That follow each another that hath fled, Image by image, in a double tier? What is more sure to bloom Than apple-flower, More sure to drop from bud into a shower, To flourish and make spring from hour to hour, Then break away and fall on death? What is more swift of limb Than deer at chase? Sun-spots and glamour, with a sunbeam's pace They are beside us: then another place Receives their shaft of fleetness dim. What of the apple-flower, O Night, What of the speeding deer, O Sea? Why is that form so whelmed in deep moonlight, Why are her pinions closed, and who is she? The Ocean knows his child; the Night above Looks on the secret of her shadowed love, Then slowly thrills, as under Ocean's kiss, And, on a windless breath, sighs Nemesis. GLAUCUS OCEAN, I am thy prophet and thy seer, And all I see is from thy fastnesses. I visit every coast, in every year, And bring thy omens to the little towns, And little bays, and watchers on the downs. Sleek dolphins bear me forth; the well-wrought foam Piles me my chariot, and the ocean-maids Spread out their long anointed hair to comb, Or by my chariot-wheels re-pearl their braids, And listen for my message to the ships With shell-like heave-apart of wondering lips; While Triton blows my flourish from the sound To bring the fishers down with leap and bound: And then I sing forth from thy fastnesses. I was a fisher once and loved to hear The voice of calm or tempest singing clear Up round the points and round the harbour-bar. I felt the music rose from deeply far And god-like depths: it urged me when to stay In port and when to launch upon the tide: But there was something in the sounds beside Their augury that moved me to be drear And lonely in my listening, till one day Spell-bound I leapt Free to thy bodeful waters and was swept, Unseen, away, Far from Anthedon's low and sandy bay. O wavering sea, I stole your ripples, hauling My net of tremulous, white fish to land, While the dawn-fleckered waves were falling In gradual decline from waist to knee; And thine eastward breath I breathed As thy brackish creatures seethed, Beating the sand. The hour I burned To drag thee to me netted, O wonder I had sailed, whose shells I trod And nestled in my toe, wave-wetted; For whose tremendous, plunging walls I yearned, And the spiky thrones that hold Great Proteus, Nereusâeach enrolled Prophet and god. I lay beside My stranded draught-net, weary For thy deep waters and their brooding hush, When, lo, across the shingle dreary My haul of fish leapt sudden to the tide, As they touched, between the sedge, Leaves upon a quagmire's edge Clothing its slush. I understood Their leap of magic gladnessâ The token I must follow them to sea. The moment reeled, and in its madness I swept the fathoms where I longed to be, Clutched those beach-side leaves that shone Like frilled glass . . . and I was gone Whither I would. Ocean, I splashed among sun-ripples down, The ebb-tide took me, like the hour of death: I was washed out afar; then sank below The billows and their clouds of sky-touched snow. But yet I had within a fount of breath, But yet there was evoked in me a thought, As terribly I sank, I could not drown. And thus thy will and my great change was wrought. I who had come to thee, as nightly come The stars to the wide darkness of the night, Like them received deep auguries and might Over men's fortunes and mysterious sway From thee and from thy darkness and the dumb Abysses of thy dark. With great array, By all the blue-eyed Oceanides Of blanched blue eyes, and past the beams and helm From many a craft or trireme, I was led And seated on a throne, while o'er my knees A sceptre fell. I saw athwart my realm One throned beside me, and a herd outspread Of curveting and midnight-sable seals; Then knew I Proteus sat with me. Amaze Lay on my pulse that I 'mid looming keels That sunk, supernal vision might behold; When, lo, another head broke through the haze Of potent depth, a visage simply old For veneration, tressed with parsley-green; And I received my doom, to sit between The wave-taught Nereus and great Proteus hoar. And seated there I drank the hidden sea; For thou, Thalassa, from thy gulf below Wast filling every cranny of my mind, So that it waved with living sea-weed, took Pure gems into its hollows, whelmed in thee Its earthliness; its memory forsook, And thy great wrath and solitude divined Out of the calm that has no ebb or flow. Thus of my passion I was raised and crowned A sea-god by the sea. Her prophecy Within the fulness of my soul I foundâ Those voices, heard along the bays on high, In springtides and in tempests and before The tempest has sailed down upon the shore; Or when in summer, noises more content Than those by flower-lost bees of Hybla sent Through all the flowering valleys, from the surf Come in a chorus over the warm rocks, And sweet in omen hang about the turf, Then die among the halcyons' dreaming flocks. And charge is laid on me to breathe them forth, Thus multitudinous upon the air, Wherever coasting billows flow or fall; To rise beside the headlands, south or north; By Asia and the lone Hesperides, To speed my dÃ¦mon on the shoreward breeze, And fatal round each point, each harbour call. I see the tumbling waves rush to the earth, The little dismal earth, so plain and bare, The sod that thinly covers in their graves My father and forefathers, that at birth Received me as its child of dust. Ah, then, My tears that drop are salt as these dear waves, And 'mid my dolphins I lament for men. NO TARRYING under pines in a pine woodâ That swept the air along as the wind wished, Although it moaned and swished Under its haircloth hood To feel constraint of toil so ruthlesslyâ I beheld a sparrow-hawk roam by In wide circles and I heard her cry After her slain young, cry impatiently Above the sunset of that starry sky. Sudden the wind ceased and the hawk was dumb Up in the bareness of the scarlet grove, Where pine-trunks and pine-branches held above A golden, grassless floor the haircloth hood Of that laborious and spiny wood: Then through the pause I heard a Presence come, As if each foot fell on a muffled drum; And towers, great city-towers, I seemed to know Were climbing through the foliage, so compact The Power that frowned down as from pinnacles, 'Mid silence such as in the heaven dwells, Or gods lay round their altar-stones below, That men might learn of altars to forgo Vain words and keep their peace in holy act. The Power that breathed was Cybele. I heard Upon her breath and heart-beats what in man Had been his speech, what in the speckled bird That late was wheeling would have been its cry. âMortal, sit down upon the sod, 'tis I, The Earth, who drew from silence at the first Thee and all woods and the horizon's span, The loose, fierce lion, the mountains in the sky; Who as I wrought and cradled them and nursed, Wove my deep ritual into everything, That never but by prayer might any fling My temple open, not with hands; that none Whose breath was garlic-tainted and less sweet Than fern is after rain beneath the sun, Should dare my threshold with forbidden feet; That all who brought a sacrifice should sit, Should touch the soil before they offered it, Bringing for sacrifice the victim's heart. The heart, the very heart, I will have that!â Steep loomed the sovereign-goddess where I sat; And terror seized me at her straight command Silence resolved that I should understand: I rose up out of moss and cones, and stood A fugitive betrayed by a whole wood, But soon I felt the passion swept along Beyond me with a fluting rush too strong To compass meâfilled with an ancient wrong; And toward the pines it breathed itself. âThy heart, Atys, I claimed and thou didst yield it mine, Burning before me, sacrifice divine, In which I had the heat of flesh and wine As worship and received it as an oath. For my oblation I accept no part, Only the central being, the full cup Of love, the jewel that the body givesâ Let it receive all jewels that blaze up From brow and strike from throat, but while it lives, If it would hold my godhead, nothing loath, Its ruby carcanet it must enshrine For me, and my omnipotence proclaim. âThus, Atys, two whole years thou wert the same; Uncloven was thy life by any jar; And with thy woodland eyes, pale as love's star, Yet ringed with midnight, in my box-groves dense, Thou gavest me thy beating heart, and hence Within my awful presence breathed at peace. Why did thy temple service ever cease? One day thy gift was gone, my altar bare; Thy worthless body of young bistre glow I loved while on the forest sod it lay, Or rose with sacrificial gesture fair, While thou didst lift some creature's heart away Far out to see its berried droplets flowâ Thy body shut its little alien gem Tight from me for a mortal's recompense, And sundered its one vow by loathed offence, Faithless and abject, whom my cool, vast hours Had bred to courage and to wisdom, powers Of spell and powers of gaiety;âwhat dire Infatuation caught thee by its fire And seared and branded thee with sapless blight, When thy discovered treason knew my sight? Vain panic-folly! Vainly was it done. Unending banishment thou couldst not shun, My banished! Yet I heard thy ruin cry For parents, country, something thou couldst give Thy miserable heart to, and so live; But to thy shrill appeal came no reply. Frenzied with solitude thou couldst not die; And through my solitudes thy frenzy roved; Yea, down my paths ran the lost thing I loved. âO Pines, that shelter Atys in your lair, A madhouse for the anguish and despair To which I drove him, must ye ever wreak Upon my ears your weary, spavined shriek, And moan with unaccepted sacrifice, That may not to the Earth be offered twice? O Atys, Atys, Atys!â Then to me, As if she asked a boon already won, She breathed in fondness âMortal, give thy heart.â The hawk rose up and called about a tree. I heard the pines still offering ceaselessly What was refusedâthen heard slow steps depart Along the wood, whence I had heard them come, As if they fell upon a muffled drum. ONE SIN ONCE I was PhÅbus: now my crown of sun Zeus hath sequestered, and my arrows lie Under the soles of his imprisoning feet; While I am overawed by circumstance. For am I not a slave? And as a slave All heavy chance impends above my day, And keeps me fearing what shall come to pass, What shame shall crush me like a rock rolled down. Why hath my thought thus fixed on Phlegyas, that Poor sinner whom I tortured by a stone, For ever in suspension overhead Upon the side of a bowed cliff in Hell? Why must I think of Phlegyas and his deed; Of how I won his daughter from the cold, From maidenhood to woman's kindled fate, Flashing my life through kisses and embrace, Whereof was born Asclepius? O my dead, My son, my thunder-blasted yesterday, How I have lost thee! And Coronis tooâ How she died faithless and hath found her place Of sepulchre within the funeral shape I gave her as a raven! But her father, Swelling with fury that a daughter's fame Was subject to my splendour, at the first Flew to a pine wood seasoned for the stuff Of such a torch as might ignite whole woods, Hill-sides or cities. Hotly to my shrine The Lapith travelled over day and night, Down valleys, up ravines, the holy spot White and alone upon Parnassus, white And very lone at daybreak, reaching fast, So unassailable his speed. A flash Went up as from an altar of my house, Though not ascending freely, but engaged Within a second with the roof-beams round; And soon the tangling flashes dimmed the white Of my facade, and down the steps there poured, Like earliest sunlight, a long stream of gold From all the molten tripods, shrines and chests Of my departing treasury. The fumes Of divination lawlessly were mixed With clouds of empty smoke; my priestess tore Her tresses, and within her eyes the blaze Made furnaces and turned them into blood. I shot one arrow . . . and imagined doom For the man's soul in Hades. Now from cleft Of that descending rock at perilous poise Among the gales of Tartarus his fear Is wafted to all passers-by, in words That make obeisance with their rending pain To justice and due honour toward the gods. He cries aloud his folly, who attacked The inmost power of Power, attacking me At Delphi, in his vengeance, where unique The golden centre of the world gives back The voices from my cave. O Zeus, O Zeus, My father, so I sinned! Thy law is pure. Thou rollest over me vicissitude, As over Phlegyas I set that curse Of fearful and delaying lava-stone. Yea, being a god, I have offended thee As he, the man, offended in his rage The god I was: for when my son that came Of that Lapithean stock, the famous leech Asclepius shining with my favour, brought The purple dead to life and smiles again, Thou with a bolt didst shatter him and slay My hope that through my son I might confer On man immortal healing: deadly rays I caught from out my orb and with the sheaf Descended Ãtna's mines, and took an aim Hour after hour at every Cyclops shut In the jagged prison till they all lay dead Among the half-punched thunder-bolts, the brands Of cooling levin; and the forges sank In mountainous night. I rose triumphant up The gaping mine; but when I saw and breathed Thy sky an isolation came about My issue from the gulf. I fell to earth; For thou hadst rent my sparkle from me, lo, My laurel-wreath was parchment, leaf on leaf, And split against my hair; the evening sun Gave me no welcome: but a Voice moved forth To dispossess me to my face. As man, Nay, among men a slave, I wept before Thy anger brooding where the Cyclops lay, And loading me with anguish. Till this hour I have been blinded to my sin nor knew My punishment aright, I who had hung My torture over Phlegyas. O Zeus, Zeus, I struck thee in thy thunder, in thy might Of fire and crash, in thy omnipotence: But like my wretched mortal bowed in Hell Under the stone of hesitating mass, Who cries out worship to the gods, acclaims Justice, with vigilance of lifted eyes, To all that pass, I feel in my own pulse Thy actual indignation. Year by year Bow over me my serfdom, let me dread The stale events that shall humiliate Each momentâhunger, loneliness, the touch Of buyer's hand or owner's promised stripes. All I accept, and in my service, Zeus, Will meekly, as a creature once divine, Praise thee, beloved Avenger. Father, mould My threatening seven long years of banishment That I may learn a cleanness in my wrath, And never thrust out worship from my deeds. As round my birth at Lemnos the salt wave Swept its pure circle, wholesome to my doom, My cleansing, be thou round me, penetrate! Confer not any more upon me wreath Or arrow, I can bear no gift of thee. My god, even as a god, heal thou thy son, Heal him and raise: the joy will recompense. VISITANTS STRANGE, on the lofty-builded boat, The ferryman should weep! Old Charon, avid still to note The coin his crossings reap! Ruthless and plain to all, With aspect like the foiling pall Of his dire roof, our sweet sky's funeral. Last night the dead, still more and more, Had lowered his boat-side: Those who beneath the mournful roar Of a volcano died, In thousands, as they must, Had each in turn his obol thrust Into a palm that wearied of its lust. Now on the shore no ghostânot one; But with tired, stealthy eyes The boatman saw a tumult run Forward, as white dust flies. His palm itched, yet he bent Reluctant on his oar, still spent With waftage of those hosts to Hades sent. On came the cloud, as if with feet All plumesâa multitude In clinging dance, their numbers fleet To impetus subdued Of one fatality. O Charon, what is this you see, This snowy flock, a wind their Mercury? They drift across the beamless slopes, They drift upon the weeds That do not dout them, streak the ropes, Frost the giant river-reeds. They are but blossom-leaves, O Charon, that a tempest cleaves From orchards, or from hawthorn-hedge bereaves. His oar drops down, his palms are pressed Together at that sight: His boatâthe ferryman may rest, And dream 'mid spectres white. He weeps their vanishing, Who offer him no gold, but bring The news that high on earth there has been spring. JASON âUPON the sea-beach I diffuse my limbs; My wail athwart the harping sea-plain heaves; The shards are bitter and the ocean brims My sorrow from a fount where darkness grieves; I, Jason, by this vessel of my pride, Lie, as vain flotsam, 'neath its doughty side. A wife I had and childrenâshe is gone To her own landâbut first she waved my feet To where my sons, her wrath had fallen upon, Lay dead together 'neath their cradle-sheet. A bride I had, but ere to bed she came Ashes of flame she was, ashes of flame. And I had comrades in grand years of youth: They are all slain or care no more for deeds. A golden aim I followed to its truth: It is a story now no mortal heeds. Once I drove oxen of fire-shooting lips, Once I was ruler of a ship of shipsâ . . . The pebbles ground like teeth within a jaw; A moan of angry timber thundered forth; And the great poop of Argo rolled its maw, With a wave's action, from the south to north: Earth quaked in fear at glimpse of Jason's doom, As slant on him fell Argo as a tomb. A DYING VIPER THE lethargy of evil in her eyesâ As blue snow is the substance of a mere Where the dead waters of a glacier drear Stand open and beholdâa viper lies Brooding upon her hatreds: dying thus Wounded and broken, helpless with her fangs, She dies of her sealed curse, yea, of her pangs At God's first ban that made her infamous. Yet, by that old curse frozen in her wreath, She, like a star, hath central gravity That draws and fascinates the soul to death; While round her stare and terrible repose, Vaults for its hour a glittering sapphire fly, Mocking the charm of death. O God, it knows! VISITING STARS DIAN, the summer Moon, her stars hath led Down the still greyness of the heat to shine As disc on disc of bowering eglantine, Through the recesses of her forest spread. The pale troops of her night are in the shade Under the oak-trees, cool and scattered far; In starred and starrier paths each ancient star Breathes as a white rose of an inmost glade. She wills her constellations, set remote, Should once at least be rural in the year, As she 'mid her green country. Mortals note Their camps are as a firmament, and there Banished, but sweet of chequer as on high, Through squirrel-threaded roof they dream the sky. NOON STRENGTH of the world, O Noon, strange things are done 'Neath thy prepollence, when the fir-spines bake A rare feast for our nostrils, and the snake With yellow-fleckered body courts the sun, Till all its reptile's blood is ichor-flame, And it becomes at once and for the hour A Prince of Heaven. We receive thy power As if the hands of some gigantic frame Beneath our arms lifted us up on high, Till we breathe sun-rays and our feet are hot, And space and shadows are remembered not. There are two moments of Earth's wizardry, Moonlight and noon: one female, of dread lure; And one in crisis giant-like, blazing, pure. HIPPONOE SHE had come downhill to the wedding-feast: Among the wealthy Lapiths she had held The white wheat-cake, and keeping watchful eyes Upon the guests, even as they spread, had spread Across it sweet new butter, drained the milk Of meadow-nurtured cows and set her teeth Deep in the pulp of unfamiliar fruit. For through the mountains where her Centaurs dwell Only the blaeberry and strawberry hard Push up around the stones. Only mare's milk and cheese Had ever passed her lips, now gluttonous With simple treat of feeding. Her blue eyes Hang in their misty blueness on the cates, The jewels of great globe, the bridegroom's trimness, The women spare, Hippodamia's grace, The white fringe of her feet upon the grass, Those cheeks of valley tenderness, those close And snake-like skirts: then dwell with constancy On Cyllarus among her Centaur race The noblest in his beauty. But he too Is gazing on the jewels as they shoot Through the bride's hair, like glow-worms, on her bosom Quicken its slope with variable flame: And ever as he chews white bread or blots The darkening grape-juice on his eager mouth Cyllarus tracks the movement of the gems, The movement of the snake-like clinging skirts The bride is wrapped in, as she stirs her feet And welcomes oft. âHippodamiaâah! And I Hipponoe.â The Centaur-girl Unites her name with sighing to the bride's, And mourns unheardââAt the first dawn of day I sought out through the highland grass a knoll Where lilies of the field Split their white pods in flower; I gathered all the flowers; Then smiled above a torrent's dam To see the wild white lilies crest my hair. And as we trotted down the mountain-path Cyllarus kept abreast with me and praised The health upon my face and fixed his gaze On the white spikes that rayed out from my hair. But, lo, she has a throne, And leans her head against it. I could never. Be queen above him thus. Oh, bitterly I long for the young spruce-firs of my glen To hide me from him, though he never looks.â Dropping one wrist upon her hoof, she eats With misty eyes her portion, and again Fixes her constant gaze on Cyllarus. âMen are about me with small loins that curve No more than harvest-sickle, men whose necks The roof-tree shades from scorching, with fair hair Fine on their heads. O Cyllarus, they win In no-wise my intentness; but the more I love thy chestnut flanks that like a ridge Of mountain lie behind thy lofty front; I love the hair that hoods thee, the bold eyes That strike from it, as weapons from a pit. I love thee more, beside the little race Of vale men, more, far more than yesterday.â Swiftly Cyllarus springs up, Swift the gilded crates are spilt, Swift the apples roll away, And the wine is lost for lips. All the Centaurs leap afoot 'Mid the womenfolk, and catch By the waist those spare white formsâ Wrathful they are carried on, Till the trees take voice of shrieks. Eurytus the Centaur bears Throned Hippodamia off: While in fury Cyllarus And Peirithous pursue. Underneath the bridegroom's stroke Eurytus rolls dead at last, And the bridegroom holds the bride, Save that Cyllarus still clings To her rumpled garment tight. Heavily Peirithous hurls Down a brazen candlestick. Straight the Attic Theseus shoots . . . With a cry, a Centaur-girl Kneels where Cyllarus is laid, Gathers up his fainting head, Kisses long his spouting wound, Gazes with a misty light On her eyes upon his eyes, Soft and tender as sun-down. Wan was his stare to see her shine with love, And wild his groan as she plucked forth the dart; He faded as she pierced herself; he turned His cheek against her heart that struck the cheek As with a blow, but ever-more was still. EROS âI HAVE no Temple!âââO young god, Give me that wide, protecting hand . . . No Temple in the land!â He gave the hand, and foot by foot we trod. Supine before us lay the Earth, Held of impregning light and half-enskied, Yet adverseâwoe betide!â Uneasy, as the starving in their dearth. A restless bull clanged on the air; Bitten young buds, once red, were pressing red Up to frost-edges dead: And on young things fell an unwearied care. Birds were dark-cradled lutes, and men And women listened, tho' they knew it not, But in a trance forgot, Till from their flesh lutes echoed back again. And secret in a green-leaved place, The Beautiful, the Idalian goddess lay Watching a spring-flower's way Up from the dark, with tremulous breast and face. AT THE GOAL âI HAVE been thralled along Down the deep defile from the hills To the dale that low murmurings throng And flight of a dark river fills. Wherefore? I love the hills, I love the clear trees in clear wind, Why have I left them behind?â He sat upon a stone and felt the sun, And on his yellow hair the sun fell gay. He was so young that nothing severed him From unremembering light, from summer trees: He dreamt as they dreamt in placidity . . . And rested, lifting up his yellow hair Wet from the fervour of his brow through speed. She speeding by among her rivulets, Glanced and was gone . . . but came again and sped Again before him, 'mid green groves of box, For so the cresses 'neath the water shone As noble groves of boxwood, sable-green And firm in crystalâcame with tresses green As sea-nymphs stream round coral-reefs and masts The deep sea-shells have climbed, undevious green Behind her as the symbol of her flight, Direct as any dove's; and little mirrors Of silver pools were swinging at her side, In which the broidered mimulus showed spots Of taffeta, reflected from her side And broidery-covered limbs, or specks of blue From pictured blue forget-me-nots. So swift She passed he did not feel her in his dream, Nor far less see her in his loitering eyes. âCome from your holes of cress, My old otter and water-rats! Up through my channel the currents press, Sit on the isle my cress-bed plats, Then eat, O my water-rats! Plunge my old otter, chime the bell Set in my stream for a spell!â The boy was startled as the otter rang The glassy chime in plunging for a swim. He fixed intent the nibbling water-rats, Round on the cress-bank as brown cedar cones On grass-plots of old turf; to his fixed eye His hand responded straight and aimed the stroke. . . . One creature rolled, all splashed among the weeds, While ripples round, aggressive in their sweep, Dazzled her watching eyes and made her faint. Lying in thwarted languor and with sting Of wrath that thrilled to phantasy of joy, She held her hair and plunged it in deep vats Of shade till it was dusk and green at once As basalt of the caves; then floated it About her, garment-like, and spotted it, On cunning clasps, with flowers in starâsuch flowers As rural Naiades must wear for pearls That spot sea-maidens with such preciousness. Last in her still alcove she sought her harp, Her fingers dallying with its shady cloth, Then drooped on its emergent silver strings, That made the coral-beaded river-trout Run past her flecked hair, and the grailings swerve. The harp was lifted, the hair-braids thrown free, Smiles wakened on the face, the lips . . . what song Can tell the softness of the gates of song? âAll notes of my music, sound, That were mine and no mortal heard, That are like the dew before dawn on the ground, All notes that night's marvellous bird From unchecked throat never heard! All the streams of the river sing To an ear's bewildering!â He rose: the stream ran on so swift, no longer Was idleness full easeâthe stream ran swift, And when an element or creature runs Who would not follow that is young for sport? How pleasant was the riverside, such greenness Under the water, such cool swish of things! The edge, the music of the water-way Through silence, taking drought from heated ears. What breath to meet that sailed refreshing on! What happiness to traverse wood and rocks Close to the fountain-gurgles and the cooings Of the stream's passage!âcrannies where the ooze Was shouldered by the lobster, or dun crabs Had given a gait to pebbles (so it seems To one who watches). Onward tripped the boy, And whistled clear and merrily a short, Glad, stunted music of the lips alone, In careless concert with that voice from bosom Of ages, from the grot of mountain-gods, And from a harp in lovely witching hands Appealing to bewitch. She drew her song Through cadences of such entreaty, boughs Stirred with it on the surface of the stream: Or, growing desperate, she flashed the strings And flashed her leaping ankles where her flood Sprang from a waterfall, such haste was hers To stop his whistling mouth and drink the lips By power of her unintermittent strain Gathering on his fancy. Yet her lures Availed not, startling, pleading openly. Had not his hand cast out the stone that struck Her messenger? Her song, assailing wide His traversed way, his steps, his way beyond, Was answered by a whistling in the sun, No voice . . . She paused and fell in manifold Depths of her stream: hidden her face; the fishes Swam fearless over her, and, as rock-crystal Out of unvalued quarries of a King, Her roof of water purpled o'er her woe, And thus through age-long moments did she dream Of that harsh valley-earth her loved one trod; And, as the strong dream entered every sense, It passed of her divinity within The substance of her rule: the pinnacles, Crests, bastions of the valley, castles, towers, Wonderful turrets of fantastic rock, She thought of, and her plastic element Took of her thought the imageâah, and woods Forlorn for secret love, steps to a bower, Her sorrow and desire both clear in art Created through that mirroring house of doom The love-path to the shadowy gaol . . . and fishes Swam over her still form; and at its brink Her river guarded her with martial reedsâ Their spears and brazen sabres motionless. âOh, what a mirror is here!â A wonderful land with a stream Lower, more shining, more sweet and clear Than this that it fills as a dream. Take me as well, O stream. Let me but tread the landing-stone To the steps and the sweet wood shown!â Adventure as of night when visions thrill And bow the spirit to a courage blind And exquisite has made the gazer stoop For that delight athwart the solid glass He only needs must break by his own death To gain as fairy spoil . . The harbour-shelf, The steps, the covert leaves! In the boy's heart A longing, and a startled tenderness, A want that strikes his lips dumb and acquaints His body with strange cries, have conquered sun And earth and easy boyhood . . . From its frame The mirror cracks, attempted. A long kiss Receives young struggling lips, a purple shade Lies over all, while, their drawn sabres bare, The reeds unchanged, unchallenged, keep their guard. THE MASK HOW bold the country where we danced . . . Great uplands, headed dark With trees, as if night's sombre mark Had sealed the vivid pasture hers, With seal of convocated firsâ A noble country by her sign enhanced. How wide the air and silence too, A single bird's wing heard, Save for the voices 'neath the bird Of masqueraders on bright grass. âWhose is this form I cannot pass? Who is she?â And they breathed a name I knew. She passed me in black velvet mask, Black as the fir-knolls, black As they upon the fields. Alack! Why must I see her as once seen, With tender pearl of face, a sheen Of childhood in her face? What would I ask? She came as comes a wind that treads Round hill-brows in the night; We stood together: âOh, for sight Of thee, my lost of many years! I have forgotten, in my fears, The way the hair about thy forehead spreads.â Powerless the Masker stood: I laid The velvet softness by. The curving mask . . . Oh, I should die To speak the bare face underneath; It were the last moan of my death . . . In cottage-smoke of age it will not fade. I shrieked and fledâhow slow my feet, And wild as they were chained! She fled . . . but where she stood remained The empty sable mask. Alas, That I had cast it on the grassâ O silent pastures and the bird's wing-beat! THE GOAD EROS, why should one or two small notes Of thrilled birds in Springâ Why should one or two gay motes Tangled round the beams on wingâ Why should delicate, first flowers, Have such powers That all music sweeps me wild, That all light of June is piled In my eyes, and gardens flow All the colour to me they shall grow? By thy eloquence, O God or Love, We are made alive . . . Thou with art all arts above Dost against our slumber drive Little shudderings of voice, Clear and choice; Stroke of slender rays to wake Our desire that summer break On us in meridian heat, Primroses by roses made effete. DRY IS THE VOICE OF MYSTERY DRY is the voice of Mystery: O Sphinx, it comes as out of sand, With shards and grit of worlds upon the air; It comes in arid murmurs from the land; It comes across wide deserts everywhere; Thirsty from thirsty throat it comes to thee. From fir-woods loosening dust in grains, That aromatic swim the wind, Then whistle round thy head-dress in thine ear: Even from the sea a dry voice is divined, Deep from its hidden heart where sounds are drear, A voice that rushes toward thee and attains. The fields of wheat resound thy speech, Their eager flood of sand makes hum, Loosening its yellow syllables as though It would into thy noon, a-wandering, come, And, in its shifted circles wandering so, Announce thy wealth across the Nubian beach. With voice distinct, barren of tears, Across thy terrible blue air, O music-loving mask, my voice I lift, From memory clean, unmuffled by despair, And while before thy face the dust-clouds shift, My song haunts whispering where thy Presence rears! IN AZNAC âTHEY murdered him, my father's son, beloved, And all the flood of life in me is moved. Weltering, furrowed, the enormous flood, And full of means to fructifyâthe mud Of Nile is in the motions of my pulse; Sources from mystic, ancient hills convulse My powers, distracting, while their purpose grows, And inundation from their centre flows. Even in their shallows, where their dalliance smiles, The things they play with are jagged crocodiles. . . . And there are lotuses, with sceptred stems, And cushioned on their leaves their diadems. Compelled to wax and welter through my soul, The dark and spiral tides diffusive roll: They shall be poured out from their patience soon; For hours ago To-day passed by its noon.â And all the afternoon Had Queen Nitocris smoothed the myrtle oil Round her fair cheeks of roses famed. And all the afternoon She had wound Egypt's double serpent's coil Till doubling on her brow it flamed. And all the afternoon She had been choosing necklaces and chose One of winged scarabs rare. And all the afternoon She watched upon her emerald dress the glose Of moonstone lotuses embroidered there. And all the afternoon She spoke impassively to vassals black, And the chief Eunuch came and went: For all the afternoon, High to her mirror or when falling back, She planned some craft of merriment. How the sun set in blaze of red, The rapine of its flambeaux spread Across the land, across the stream! . . . Night ruled as though no day had been. The palace by the water cast Gleams upward from its bases vast, As from a dancer's feet shoot out Bright rays that in ascension flout The radiance from the neck and face: Athwart the river-current's race So glows the palace from below With festival, as fishers know Who seek their catch upon the Nile. âThe great Room will be usedâ they smile; âAnd we should be down there to see And join the pampered revelry.â In the deep hall below the stream Torchlit the golden vessels gleam, And ruby bowls of lucid glass; And flowers there are in sating mass, As a whole land were stripped of flowers. While fruit is offered under bowers Of urgent blossoms that would draw Want out of surfeit: on the floor Perfumes no man should breatheâbut die, And breathe of them immortally. Surely, the bidden guests are prized! For Queen Nitocris, tranquillized From all her woe, is with the troop. See, how she rises; see, how stoop The double snake-heads in her hair, And how she smiles to be so fair, And bid such eager eyes adieuâ But it is meet that she withdrew And gave the feasters unzoned mirth. She rises, as a goddess leaves the earth; And surging in her loveliness of pride, Her panoplyâas peacock-feathers glide, Eyeing observers of the peacock's showâ Surges, and follows round her, to and fro, And sweeps, exultantly aware, the gaze, With lengths of emerald tissue and its glaze Of moonlight and its blues of hollow night: While all her scarabs clatter, like a flight Of night-birds. And the Queen, the Fair One, gone, 'Mid shouts, there is none else to look upon. âThe night is hot for feasters in my vaults, Now that excess no longer halts, Now it is free; And shouts come up from far beneath the stream, No more acclaiming, it would seem, My power nor me. Lo, is there change, a gurgle of the tide? My palace drinks, beatified, The waters black, Bitter as sea-slime, of the weedy Nile. Drink, Aznac, drink, my House, beguile Your thirst nor lack; Engorge the volume of your lust, fill deep The entrails of your building steep! I see no more The dazzle in the waters from your feast; The torches' mounting rays have ceased, Dead to the core; The seaweeds and the river weeds now rush Unlit along, in tangles lush; Yet are there cries, Not sprung of wine; O Nilus, of thy draught, That by the feasters must be quaffed, As each one dies, Who killed my brother Papi, in the swirl Of upper waters as they hurl Their flood below; And in the flooded subterranean hall The level tables shift and fallâ No cates, no glow Of roses; but the flood and flowers and men Are drenched and whelmed and then Sink or expire. Silent the sodden flowers, but the men shriek, As Nilus and my Aznac wreak The anger dire That is as Nile in flood within my soul, That is as Aznac, built and whole Within my breast, That must absorb, kill and obliterate, With rich capacities of hate, Those I detest.â She laid her face upon the marble ledge: The gurgle ceased to chafe the river's edge; And the great Palace held the bodies tight Of those who murdered Papi in the night. She lifted up her face, with wearied eyes, Priestess of unavailing sacrifice. The stars looked weary back into her eyes. She listened . . . fain to hear from living cries. The water hummed beside a crocodile: And Aznac threw its shadow on the Nile. LIGHT AND SHADOW KING! . . . The King, the King! It is midnoon . . . Our King of Antioch, Antiochus our Epiphanes in mid-noon! Head and body rock; He himself all gold Of one single fold Rolled about him, rolled As if a goldsmith rolled it round a form of man. Roses of wide span, How they are straying, drooping low in their festoon Round his forehead, roses of white eye, Of whitest, snow-white eye and crimson petalling! Both his hands with swing of lullaby Here and there and yonder, close, far off and further fling Coin of the King. How low the summer's roses topple round his face From high head as yellow as a hive! Gold Antiochus in the gold market-placeâ While the people on their bellies strive, As he showers the coin athwart their backs, And it drops to where they strive and clutch. Stay! Was there ever one among all monarchs suchâ A rose-crowned, golden statue, with his gold in sacksâ Ever such full noon of monarchy? And he himself the god upon the drachmasâsee! He is glutted with his dreary play: And the people scuffle fierce with greed . . . They have never seen him pass away, As a golden leopard in his speed; Pass away From that mid-day, And enter secret shadows winding toward the bay. I have seen, And am following a space between. How he carries flowers where shadows lurk, Frank and gorgeous roses to the murk Of the mid-noon, cavernous descent Toward the bay to which his steps are bent, Toward the bay or some more secret aim. Very dire his clouded roses flame, And his robe is as a lightning-stroke, Fire that leaps without a smoke . . . I am leaping too, So swift he threads me through The black alley from the market-place. Stay!âhis face! Stay!âit turns! How the great rose-chaplet burns! But the cold face of a lizard spurns From beneath it, with a thin, cold smile. Still he glides awhile . . . Out of sight! . . . But what is this? Shards are flying, stroke and hiss, Quick, to overwhelm my flight, Thrown sheer backward with an athlete's might. Torn, I bleed . . . Hiss, hiss, hiss! . . . Then he is gone indeed. Golden treasure for the market-place, And for those he wantonly would join: But he guards his privacy with face Of a traitor and with shards for coin. VAIN STRIFE THEY had fought a single combat fell, In the Court of Listenese, So the wild histories of Arthur tell. Sudden, as the wind snaps trees, Burst Sir Balim's sword asunder; And it checked the strife with wonder At that steely crack of thunder . . . Just one moment of great awe Turned the quarrel into peace, then brokeâ For Sir Balim through an open door Darted from King Pelam's threatened stroke. Through the unknown Castle shot In mad haste Sir Balim, seeking Sword, that he discovered not, For revenge he would be wreaking: As in vain he ran and sought, Footfall of the King he caught Following and full of stress 'Mid the Castle's loneliness: For King Pelam followed fast; Through each hall and chamber passed, Fanning like a moth or bird All the air Sir Balim stirred, Till a little tempest beat Round the foemen's tireless feet . . . Down the Castle-halls and through All the rooms they fled into . . . And the terror of that air Was of woe beyond compareâ Those who sought each other's death Drew with cruel feet this breath. Oh, a room! A hope 'mid fear . . . Sharp on Balim's eyes appear Spokes of gold from gold-cloth of a bed, From the clean gold of a table spread With a spear, a marvellous wrought spear. Swift, amid the glow from bed and board, Sir Balim sees the spear-ray leap . . . Then he faces swift his foe abhorred, Driving in his flesh the weapon deep. Swoon upon King Pelam falls; Terror shakes the Castle-wallsâ The walls and ceiling tremble, break and fall, Down sinks on his face Sir Balimâall Lie sunken with the Chamber as a pall. Only Galahad, when seeking far The san graal, with forehead like a star, Having found the Vessel of God's Blood, That within the Castle-chapel stood, May revive those sleepers from the dead: For 'mid gold festoonings of that bed Joseph, out of Aramathy, lay Balmed and silent, day and night and day; And the wondrous spear that Balim sped Fierce against his foe, when Christ hung dead, Had been by Longius struck with force In the well-spring of the Holy Corse. FELLOWSHIP I IN the old accents I will sing, my Glory, my Delight, In the old accents, tipped with flame, before we knew the right, True way of singing with reserve. O Love, with pagan might, II White in our steeds, and white too in our armour let us ride, Immortal, white, triumphing, flashing downward side by side To where our friends, the Argonauts, are fighting with the tide. III Let us draw calm to them, Beloved, the souls on heavenly voyage bound, Saluting as one presence. Great disaster were it found, If one with half-fed lambency should halt and flicker round. IV O friends so fondly loving, so beloved, look up to us, In constellation breaking on your errand, prosperous, O Argonauts! IV Now, faded from their sight, We cling and joy. It was thy intercession gave me right My Fellow, to this fellowship. My Glory, my Delight! March 1914</field>
