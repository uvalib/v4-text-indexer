With fadirly preceptis þat thou sholdist rule ? thempire &amp; his persone. Submytted to him as to souereyn lorde ? thou sholdist offer honoure In seruise like a duke the shewe and fadirly in pytee By the it was that this yonge prince ? lernyd tasswage þe heetys Of his yonge lady &amp; manhode toke ? not first with Venus lust But with worship of laweful chambir ? and wedlockis chaste covenaunt Happy thou art in such prynce ? which now thi son lawe is More happy yit forsothe is he ? by the his fadir lawe. As grete cure also thou haddist ? his brothir to mayntene To educate and to brynge forthe ? archadium to the commytted And how be it his shrewde seruauntis ? wolde ofte her wodenesse vse Pretendyng evir the Kyngis title ? and vndir his name þe wrongid Thou ascridest al this to youthe ? for whan discorde was mooste Stillicois wrath was not perceived ? ofte tyme he had rebukys With swerdis sought ? and ofte provokyd ? with bataile him self to venge And to yive cause within the londe ? of risyng of common peopil The reuerence yit of thi souereyns high ? and of the brethern tweyn Evir clene was savid within thi breste ? stabelisshid with meanys of feithe In myddis of tho grete discoursis ? in themperours halle late reysed .V. Stillico devideth feithfully bitwix honorie &amp; archadie þe goodis of hir fader Thou partyst even bitwix thise brethern ? mantels in sidon wrou?te And bawdrikis boocyng with brochis bolde ? &amp; gownys with gemmys broudrid Habergeownys also with smaragdis grene ? &amp; helmys with iacincte clere Swerdis vnto hir fadir yove ? with shynyng hiltes riche And crownys which apparailed were ? with dyuers price of stonys That householde stuffe sholde not be streyte ? or odde thise heyris founde Thou sendist him kny?tis althogh thou drede ? his hoostis be reised ayens [the] Thyn aduersary rather thou chesyst to strengthe ? þan feith shold fal in the Al that right is thou grauntyst soon ? and oonly thou denyest Whos naytyng is cause of grete reioyse ? whan truthe is wele discussyd Al goddesses moreovir þat put awey ? synne fro pure lyppes Haue ioyned her dauncys within thi breste ? which vsid hem to receive And busye hem selfe even as thou wilte ? with the labours to take. .VI. Iustice ? pacience ? Temperaunce Prudence &amp; Constaunce techith stilico. Iustice moevith to preferre right ? bifo[r]en al othir availe And commoun lawys moost for to folowen ? &amp; wronge nevir yive with wetyng Pacience the techith tendure thi body ? that it laboure love Temperaunce chaste thyngis forto chese ? &amp; prudence evir tave counceil Withoute advise that no thyng passe ? and constaunce willeth also That thou doo nou?te with weyke corage ? ne that thou owest eschewe. Vncurteys goddis and importune ? fer from thy mende arn dreve. Which from caves þat monstruous be ? ofte tartarus loosith to men. The seconde parte .VII. Stilico excludith auarice and ambicion. Thou first defoilest auarice ? þe modir of wrecchidnessis That evir in havour is nedy founde ? &amp; thristeth more &amp; more which with chekis right wide sette ope ? golde dolve depe seergith With her also thou puttist to shame ? her loothsom norice ambicion Which evir lyeth waite at chambir doorys ? &amp; at riche mennys yates Her marchandises conveying forth ? which desired high worshippes The common swelough of mannys life ? which rote is of grete cryme In ofte vsyng vnleeful raveyn ? and makith a wrecchid lawe. This damysel corrupcion is right wele namyd ? þat drewe þe with noon example No riche man is by the oppressid ? for love of hous or londe. No theef is suffrid to lyen in weyes ? there felawys him like to make No vertue is hyd or caste awey ? though poverte be Ioyned þerto ffrom al marchis from al cuntrees ? þou chesist to þe gode folke And askist what life this man hath had ? not what cradyl him rockyd Ne of whens he is but his condicion ? gladly thou requyrest. Easyly with the thus thi men live ? thou seith of hem evir wele Thy rewardys calle hem to noble maners ? &amp; Jentle condicions to vse Be thyn excytyng craftys lefte ? þat som tyme were wele knowe Be had now newly ageyn in mynde ? &amp; gladsom wey is openyd To happy wittis which evir reioysen ? vertue in pryncis high The modrys of eloquence the musys ix ? which late durst nat loke vp Now lefte her neckys &amp; wisely talke ? dytees ful delectable. Bothe pore and riche labouryd righte sore ? encrese to gete with studye ffor either of hem wele vndirstode ? þat wise travaile must growe Where sluggid Idilnes myght not vprise ? in myddis of tresours grete .VIII. Stilico excludith vicious lyfe of bodye. Lechery the dowsett syn ? which oonly abideth the doome And sentence of deceivable flessh ? coude nat the supplante. ffor al the height of hir forhede ? and hir pretendid myrthe In mystes of her ? mannys wittys be dullyd ? &amp; she mysshapith som bodies More cruelly than circes herbis ? which venemyd be with poysoun. She semyth right faire of outeward chiere ? ful lothful she is within Her chekys ar peyntid her vesture gay ? is made men to deceive Her heerys blake arn dressid aboute ? with precious shynyng golde With hookis of lust she many a soule ? beforn this tyme hath take But yit nevir the ? she so diseasyd ? as oonys thi slepe were broke To folowe her wille ne nevir in feste ? þurgh songe of man or childe In the she had a restyng place ? or tarying ony while. .IX. Stilico is preysed of occupacion and othir vertuous dedys Who myght the see vnoccupied ? or dissolute eithir in soule As thogh no thing were charge to the ? ne peysed not for þe worlde Or seigh the evir for cause of myrthe withoute mesure in mete Expensis which the vnworship myght ? nevir lessid thi tresoure And also thi writyng testifieth ? thi yiftes be not streyned In noon smal boke thei may be writen ? this causid þe to be lovid Of al thy kny?tis as for her fadir ? whom than thou makist not riche Whan werre tyme is and whan pees is ? þou list not hem to knowe Right wele thou felyst yat yiftes not plese ? þat longe be lokid aftir And for fere oonly be offrid to hem ? whom late þou settist not by In veyne than thou wastist awey ? thi golde longe reservid Wherfore thou preventist tyme ? and soon thi bowntee shewist Art glad to see peple at thi borde ? and euery man by his name. Benygnely clepist and for thi love ? remembrist what he hat doon. Thi godely wordis arn so bisett ? þat hem he nevir foryetith By the which he thynkith þat thi grete yifte ? is doublid in his hande Whan ought þou grauntist avauncyng noon ? þou vsist to make þerof Or him either tabreide therby ? which it receivid of the Ner thou spekist not sternely to hem which thou hast promotid With high chiere &amp; contenaunce ? ne spillest no wynde for pride. .X.
