      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME I THE ROSE OF CORBYE, IN TWO CANTOS. CANTO THE FIRST. 1 O may this tale of former days But cheat the bosom of a sigh, How pleas'd will be the unknown Bard, Who boasteth not of minstrelsy ! Tho' weak the tones of his broken harp, And he in song with few can vie, Fain would he sing in virtue's praise, And dry the tear from sorrow's eye; Tho' poverty hath bow'd him low, And the wise and wealthy pass him by. 2 O have you heard of young Ellinor, The peerless maid of fair Cumberland? How, where Eden steals to merry Carlyle, Her castle did hill and dale command? Or how she lov'd the bold young Dacre, And the Black Baron he sought her hand? 3 And have you heard how young Ellinor Had suitors far from east and west? How, she was fairest of all the fair, And of maidens good, she was the best? How, virtue shone in every smile, And pity's mansion was her breast? How, when the helpless sought her aid, Each found himself a welcome guest? How, many a courteous knight and squire, For love of her, could take no rest? 4 But love is oft a load of woe; And love is oft a dangerous snare; It makes time fly on leaden wings, And fills the breast with every care; It robs youth of the rose's hue, And plants a faded lily there: Love leads to bliss; love leads to pain; To heavenly joys, or to dark despair. 5 And have you heard of the gallant Dacre, The tyrant's scourge; his country's pride? Whose shield borne by his ancestry, With many a foeman's blood was dy'd; His look made captive high-born dames, Yet ne'er to win a heart he tried: War was the hero's dear delight; Ay when his country call'd, he hied; Yet to soothe the sorrows of weak man, O'er moor and mountain he would ride. 6 And have you heard of Corbye Castle, Where wild woods wave, and waters flow; And many an aged spreading oak Shelters the nimble deer and roe? How its rocks are high, and its bow'rs are sweet, And it seems a paradise below? How it is the seat of as bold a race, As e'er welcom'd friend, or fac'd a foe? How there fair Ellinor first drew breath, As sweet a bud as the eye e'er saw? O never from this castle gate, May the beggar poor unpitied go! For blest are they who soothe distress; And heal the pains of want, and woe! 7 If you have not heard, then rest a while, And you shall hear a true-told song; It first was chaunted by old Grey Graeme, Who lived the silver birks among: And now the minstrel rests in peace, Long may it please both old and young! 8 A song oft drives dull care away, When Winter nights are dark and long; Beguiles the labour of the day; And he who scorns a well-meant song, Whate'er he be, it seemeth to me, In that he always acteth wrong. 9 âAnd who,â you say, âwas old Grey Graeme?â He was a minstrel, blithe and gay; And oft in Corbye's antient hall, He to fair Ellinor lov'd to play; And sweet to her were his ditties wild, That told of many a former day; Of Scottish knights, of English dames, And how fell the brave in border fray; But alas! his songs are heard no more, Or the harp's wild notes on the stone so grey; For time who worketh every change, Hath swept the simple strains away. 10 How few they be now in our days, Who in old hall e'er sweep the string! How few reward the minstrel poor! How few of other times can sing! 'Tis sweet to hear the song of old, That oft hath made the wild woods ring; It warms the heart of wrinkl'd age, And makes man taste a second spring; It cheats the bosom of a sigh; And from the eye a tear can bring. 11 Grey Graeme was born in western Isle, And for Scotland's King had fought and bled; But when he spake of his five brave sons, The old man wept and hung his head: For they were slain by the furious Dane, When the foe's bleak shore was dy'd with red; Still did he bow to the will of heav'n, Though every joy of life was fled; And long in hall, or by ivied tow'r, Or near castle gate had he play'd for bread. 12 Oft he would tell right merry tales; Oft he would caution list'ning youth; Oft warn the old of death's approach, With serious look, in lays uncouth: For much Grey Graeme had seen, I trow, And much had sought in quest of truth: And many a mountain steep had cross'd, Since time had mark'd his manly growth. 13 Sweet were his strains, at eve's grey hour, When Summer's carpet deck'd the ground; And now to love he'd strike the harp; Now to wild war the strings he'd sound: Now songs of sorrow, soft and slow, Would draw a tear from all around; Next changing to a lightly strain, The laughing maid would frisk and bound. 14 O music! music, thy pow'r is great! It cures the mind of many a wound; Cold is the heart it cannot meltâ Of such, I hope but few are found! 15 Alas! alas! how few they be, Who in old hall now sweep the string! How few reward the minstrel poor! How few of other times can sing! 'Tis sweet to hear the song of old, That oft hath made the wild woods ring; It warms the heart of wrinkl'd age, And makes man taste a second spring; It cheats the bosom of a sigh, And from the eye a tear can bring: By music sooth'd, in want or woe, Quick to the winds all cares we fling. 16 Grey Graeme was bent, his locks were white, Pale was his face, and sunk his een; Yet still a smile bespoke content, Tho' poor this harper was, I ween: Fair Ellinor stripp'd off his worn-out weeds, And clad him all in a garb of green. 17 His lodgment was a small house of stone, Where he could laugh at the winter keen: Still was he priz'd whene'er he stray'd, By wealthy squire, or peasant mean. The ruin near the silver birks, Tells where old Grey Graeme's hut has been; And the mould'ring stone that marks his grave, By many a wanderer yet is seen. 18 Now it fell about the blithe new year, When mountains high were capp'd with snows; Young Dacre he would a hunting go, And threescore men and three he chose: Saying âWe will range both wood and wild, Where to merry Carlyle old Eden flows!â 19 Ne'er would he bow to tyranny; His mind was bent on Freedom's cause; Ne'er had he sigh'd a slave to love, Nor did he dream of a peerless rose. 20 In border fray, or in foreign fight, He brav'd the boldest of the field; Ay when his country cried to arms, The first was he to grasp the shield, For many a foe had own'd his might, But few his massy sword could wield; And glory was his whole delight, But glory oft to love must yield. 21 Yes, glory must to love give way; The brave to beauty still must bow; In vain we scorn the urchin bold, In vain to 'scape his snares we vow: The crimson'd cheek, and the eye of fire, Will drive a frown from the hero's brow; And he who scorns the fairest fair, May soon be captive led, I trow! 22 With merry hearts, each drank his ale, And they are all a hunting gone; The dogs were swift, and the sports were good, And bounding deer full many a one, And wily fox, the farmer's hate, And hare as fleet as e'er could run; Such, Dacre, and his merry clan, Had slain, before the day was done. 23 They hunted many a wood and wild, Where Eden strays to merry Carlyle; And when the evening frosts come on, What pleasure was, was now a toil. Red Robin on a high hill stood, And distant saw an antient pile; âAnd in that castle,â quoth the Dacre, âWe may, methinks, find rest a while. 24 âFor rest brings health, and blithe content; And rest can all our cares beguile; And rest is still the good man's friend, But justly scorns the sinner vile. 25 âAnd when the moon peeps o'er the hill, We will hie home right speedily; And to-morrow drink of the nut-brown ale, And tell what merry sports had we; But may he never taste nut-brown ale, Who hunting hates, or a fair ladie! 26 âYet by my fay, I none have seen, Who e'er could make a slave of me! The piercing eye, the rosy cheek, The snowy breast, and the heart of glee; Nay, were she fairest of the fair, With every grace of the graces three, I would not bow a female's slave, For all the wealth of Christendie! He who delighteth in hero's deeds, From ladie's look must keep him free! 27 âFor when love shoots his arrows keen, Care snatches all our joys away; Sunk in an agony of woe, Love claims the night, love claims the day: And love can pierce decrepid age, With furrow'd cheeks, and locks so grey; Love opes alike the palace gates, And the lowly latch of the shepherd gay; Love holds each lure to glowing youth, That oft, alas! the heart betray. 28 âNow, comrades all, let's merry be, And thankful, still, for pleasures pastâ Oh! mercy on the houseless poor, Who bear keen want, and the piercing blast! But He who guides this frightful storm, Can give the weary ease at last.â 29 The light shone bright in Corbye Castle, And loud the northern blast did blow, Where spreading woods of leafless trees Shelter'd the trembling deer and roe: The star of eve now lent a ray, Now hid by many a cloud of snow; While Eden o'er his rocky bed, In hollow sounds was heard below. 30 The Dacre knock'd loud at the gate; And who so ready was, within, As fair Ellinor to unbolt the gate, And welcome strangers, kith or kin? Quoth Dacre, âAn angel by my fay! Such beauty would tempt to sin: Methinks, when nature form'd that face, 'Twas wisely meant the world to win!â 31 Yes glory must to love give way; The brave to beauty still must bow; In vain we scorn the urchin bold, In vain to 'scape his snares we vow: The crimson'd cheek, and the eye of fire, Will drive a frown from the hero's brow; And he who scorns the fairest fair, May soon be captive led, I trow! 32 Now she has curtsey'd to the Dacre, And bid them welcome, one by one; She has given to each the nut-brown ale, To the bold Dacre she gave none; But a silver horn of the blood-red wine, And a look that any heart might won; For fairer maid was never form'd, I trow, to grace a proud monarch's throne 33 With trembling lips, and blushing cheek, With gazing eye, and breast of flame, Soon as he told what drew them there, And who he was, and whence he came; The look of pleasure mark'd her face, Soon as she heard the hero's name, And he was welcomed with a smile, That tyranny itself might tame. 34 And much he suffer'd from that look, For it has cost him many a sigh: Now having learn'd where stands his hall, And the streaming Lyne hoarse murmurs by, And O his name! a name well known, O'er oceans wide, and mountains high, She lighted him to the fairest chamber, Wherein the Dacre he might lie; Tho' he wearied was, the long, long night, Love wou'd not let him close an eye. 35 For love it causeth sleepless nights, And love it causeth days of pain; And when love robs us of our rest, 'Tis long ere we can rest again; It makes a coward of the hero bold, And binds him with a silken chain; Time only can relief afford, To struggle proves too oft in vain: From palac'd prince, to vassal vile, Mankind he tames o'er earth and main. 36 How cou'd he sleep? He saw her form; Her winning look; her easy grace; He heard her voice, most musical, Then thought he of her matchless face; And of the praise her sire had won, For she was of a noble race: The more he thought, the more he sigh'd, All seemed quite an enchanted place. With pride, long may he bless the hour, When with his clan he sought the chace! 37 But love is like the opening rose, When Phoebus ushers in the morn; Tho' fragrant blooms this queen of flow'rs, Its leaves conceal a piercing thorn: As fades a rose, when the bleak blast blows, So love is blighted by ladie's scorn. 38 And love is like a lily flow'r; And love is like a feverish dream; A bitter draught it soon may turn, Tho' now life's luxury supreme. 39 Young Ellinor is to her chamber gone, But good lack-a-day! she cannot rest! She dreams not of the lords and knights Who sought her, far from east and west; But feels a pain ne'er felt before, And many a sigh escapes her breast: In fancy, she beholds the smile, And manly form of her far-fam'd guestâ Of Dacre, why does she think and start? Those who in love have been, know best. 40 But love is oft a load of woe; And love is oft a dang'rous snare; It makes time fly on leaden wings, And fills the breast with ev'ry care; It robs youth of the rose's hue, And plants a faded lily there; Love leads to bliss; love leads to pain; To heav'nly joys, or to dark despair. 41 When the black shades of night were gone, And from his roost the grey cock crew, Who rose so ready as the young Dacre, In hopes soon Ellinor to view? For she was fair as the mountain snows; Her cheek bloom'd with health's rosy hue; And o'er her bosom, pure as white, Her flaxen locks in tresses flew. Ah! who cou'd gaze, and not be won, When Love laugh'd in her eyes of blue! 42 For Love can wound, without a scar; And Love can bind, without a chain; Mid' savage Winter's frightful storms, Love finds his way o'er land and main: Love's arrows pierce the bravest heart, And soon subdue the proud and vain; And when man bows a slave to Love, 'Tis hard his freedom to regain. 43 By day and night, Love wings his flight, O'er barren heath, and flow'ry plain; Mid' Summer's heat, and Winter's cold, Love glories in his tyrant reign: His bow is bent to wound the heart Of monarch proud, or lowly swain; But one kind glance from her we prize, Can freedom give, and banish pain! 44 The next that rose Brown Adam was; And the Gibsons, that by Irthing dwell; The Scotts, who fear no Scottish laws; The Weirs; the Jardins; and the Bell; Jocks Tom, who knew each roaring linn, Each moor and mountain, moss and dell; Hob o' the Syke, and his two sons, Who fought the best at Tindle Fell; The Howme Foot Harry; Grizzy's George; And Hardy Wat, no man cou'd fell. 45 The Potts'; the Elliots o' the Buss; Strang Wull; and Gib o' Hether Side; Blue Davie o' the Hingan Shaw; The laird's young Ralph, Kirklinton's pride; The Nobles; Fosters; John o' Cleugh; Old Hardin, that had most been tried; Black Fergus, that slew young Buccleugh, And Liddal's flood ay scorn'd to ride; Braid Andrew; Geordie o' the Burn; Names known and dreaded, the borders wide. 46 Brown Barney, o' the Buller Syke; And Smiddy Dick; and Cocker Will; And white Tom's Tom; and Kirsty's Kit; And Rose-trees Rob; and Three-thoum'd Gill: Lang Philip, now bent short with age, Fam'd far and wide, for healing skill; The dart o' death ay fain to ward, But ne'er wou'd draw a doctor's bill. 47 The Carrs, the brag o' Leversdale; The Jameses five, from Scaleby Hill, Who wan the day at Brampton fray, And drave the fae-men 'yont the mill; They'd fly to face the fiercest Scot, But ne'er wou'd do a neighbour ill. 48 And Bolton Clem, with Clem his son; White Willy o' the Bleaberry; Mad Matt; and Sawney o'er the Knowe; Red Sim, with all his billies three; The least stood full two yards in height, The one a giant was to see; Oft did they strip the Scottish howmes, And many a Scot they made to flee: Each had his home on the Dacre' lands, And they were a goodly company. 49 And they were welcom'd, one, two, and three, By Ellinor, into the hall; Where the tables groan'd with wholesome fare, And blithe and merry I trow were all: And old Grey Graeme, in his garb of green, Who still was ready at our ladie's call, Now with his harp was seated near, And sung of many a brave warrior's fall. 50 O music! music, thy power is great! It cures the mind of many a wound; Cold is the heart it cannot meltâ Of such, I hope but few are found. 51 Alas! the Dacre nor eat nor drank, But sunk a willing prey to love; And oft he check'd the rising sigh, And oft to join in mirth he strove. Ah! little thinks the dauntless youth, What pains, what pleasures, he must prove! 52 Yes, glory must to love give place; The brave to beauty still must bow; In vain we scorn the urchin bold, In vain to 'scape his snares we vow: The crimson'd cheek, and the eye of fire, Will drive a frown from the hero's brow; Who scorns the fairest of the fair, May soon be captive led, I trow; And he who was so bold of late, A willing slave, sits sighing now. 53 With wistful gaze, uprose the Dacre, 'Tis far, far to his woody glen; Where stands his hall, and his tower strong, The Scots oft tried to seize in vain: There, watching, sits his feeble mother, Praying for him, and his dauntless men; For, O, he was her only son, Her only child now left of ten! 54 Yound Ellinor's lily hand he kiss'd, And sad he look'd, and she turn'd pale; What moment of this life so sweet, As when we list true lover's tale? And thrice he vow'd a solemn vow, Ere the next moon shone in the vale, Again he'd range both wood and wild, And his comrades drink of her nut-brown ale: The last look told her how he lov'd, And how her loss he would bewail. 55 For when Love shoots his arrows keen, Mirth follows mirth, hours dance away Rapt in an exstacy of bliss, Love claims the night, Love claims the day: Love opes alike the proud palace gates, And the lowly latch of the shepherd gay; And Love can pierce decrepid age, With furrow'd cheeks, and locks of grey; Love lends new joys to glowing youth, That oft, alas! the heart betray! 56 Now as they homeward bent their way, Where waters flow, and wild woods wave, Young Dacre many a look behind, To Corbye's fading castle gave. The tale and song, the laugh and joke, No more his sinking spirits save; Nor heeded he their revelrie, For he was beauty's willing slave, Whose smile gives man each dear delight, Whose frown oft sends him to the grave. 57 Quoth Potts, âI's haud my guid scotch quey, We suin wull hunt thes way again!â âNay!â cries old Hardin, âtous ay wrang! Our laird maun come tes way hes lane! Hey's stout and comely, a beauty shey, And o' his choize he may weel be vain; But the fairest shey, in a' Chressendie, I wad the Dacre caw'd her his ain!â 58 Quoth Noble, âshey's a bwonnie bird, Whare we hae been! woo but I'd gie My weyfe, my gear, my bairnies five, Just yenze her hinny mou to prie!â âHout, hout!â cries Sim, âgie mey her yell! For her kisses I'd no care a flea!â âHaith!â quoth the Cleugh, âour laird afore, Has gott'n his deeth frae her pawkie e'e! But a lass sae bwonnie, young, and guid, I trow, wull a reeght kind doctress be!â 59 Now as they pass'd thro' merry Carlyle, They were a comely sight to view; The wives threw open their windows wide, And marvell'd much what was to do: Not one was there, but in border fray, Had made his man full dearly rue; And not all the men in old Carlyle town, Could have taken the Dacre and his brave few! 60 And as they pass'd thro' Rickar Gate, In this street or gate leading north from Carlisle, the inhabitants of the borders (or debateable lands) commonly assemble on market-days. Filled with poisonous liquors, and more so with a maddening spirit of revenge for any trifling injury a friend or relative may have sustained, an uprorious evening scene formerly took place, to the great annoyance of the town. The combatants generally fought with leaden-headed whips, made for the purpose. This antient and barbarous custom has now given way to friendly intercourse and rational pleasures. The education of a family, and agricultural improvements, engross the attention of the aged farmers: a spirit of industrious emulation having been occasioned by the great increase of rents. Horse-racing, cockfighting, and other amusements, equally idle, have been superseded by an ever-pleasing thirst after useful knowledge. Quoth Brown Adam, âThere's the spot, I trow, Whare liv'd the flow'r of a' Carlyle; And sweet to me was her hinny mou! Tho' she was woo'd by a' around, Yet to be mine, she made a vow; And for my winsome breyde, my Jean, I wheyles gat bang'd; bein aft blin fou: But, Deil rive my sark, gin a Carel chiel Dare cry bo! to Brown Yeddy, now!â 61 And when they cross'd the Carlyle sands, Cries Davie, âMark yon castle wa'; Mak our young Dacre the governor, And the bravest Scot e'er Scotland sa' Shou'd he an Armstrang dare rescue, He suin wad feel a Dacre's blow: The girt Buccleugh, This stanza alludes to the brother of Johnny Armstrong, the noted free-booter, who lived at Gilnockie Tower, now a ruin, on the banks of the river Esk, near Langholm. Kinmont Willy suffered a long and unjust confinement in Carlisle Castle. Young Buccleugh, with forty chosen from among the sons of his tenantry, bravely determined, at every hazard, to rescue suffering Willy. They succeeded in the dangerous attempt, and had it in their power to have seized the governor (Lord Hunsdon) and all his attendants. and a' his crew, Wad ne'er hae ventur'd here awa! But wae betide yer suthern lwords! A manly sword they darena dra'!â 62 The Dacre heard, but silent heard, For love had fill'd his breast with care; And love oft proves a load of woe, And love is oft a dang'rous snare; It robs youth of the rose's hue, And plants a faded lily there: Love leads to bliss; love leads to pain; To heav'nly joys, or to dark despair. 63 How eager sits his good old mother, Young Dacre watching, from tower high; And many with their children look, âThey suin wull come!â oft do they cry: They gaze along the woody glen, And o'er the hill with eager eye, When swift and swifter over the moor, Foremost they see the Dacre fly. âO, God be prais'd!â says the feeble mother, âI count them all in safety nigh! And long may happiness be theirs, The manly clan I now espy!â 64 They parted, fain to be at home, A father, child, or wife to see; To-morrow they drink the nut-brown ale, And keep the Dacre good companie: Each man will drink to fair Ellinor, And tell their sports, with merry glee; But may he never taste nut-brown ale, Who hunting hates, or a fair ladie! And he whose heart is sunk in love, I wish him soon from trouble free! 65 For Love can wound, without a scar; And Love can bind, without a chain; Mid' savage Winter's frightful storms, Love finds his way o'er land and main: Love's arrows pierce the bravest heart, And soon subdue the proud and vain; And when man bows a slave to Love, 'Tis hard his freedom to regain. 66 By day and night, Love wings his flight, O'er barren heath, and flow'ry plain; Mid' Summer's heat, and Winter's cold, Love glories in his tyrant reign: He bends his bow to wound the heart Of monarch proud, or lowly swain; But one kind glance from her we prize, Will freedom give, and banish pain! END OF CANTO FIRST. CANTO THE SECOND. O would to me some pitying Muse A while her cheering aid impart! 'Tis sweet to sooth the pensive mind, When sorrow's tear begins to start; But vainly have I sought to twine The wreath that shews a Poet's art: Tho' weak my lays, in virtue's praise, They yet may touch the feeling heart! 2 Now wou'd you know of the Black Baron? His castle stands on the banks of Tyne; Its walls are strong, and its dungeons deep, In which the feeble are doom'd to pine: And he has wagered a thousand merks, As they sat drinking the blood-red wine. 3 Quoth he, âEre twelvemonths and a day, The Rose of Corbye shall be mine!â But woe unto thee, thou Black Baron! May never maid to thee incline! 4 âI wager, ere twelvemonths and a day, The Rose of Corbye sits in this hall; Where I have had young, fair, and gay; And tho' she fairer be than all, I will not woo her for a bride; Love shall not so this heart enthrall: Who takes denial from womankind, He, by my fay, deserves a fall! Ah! little think'st thou, peerless Rose, How soon life's cup I'll fill with gall! 5 âWho stoops to ladie, still she scorns; Who gently woos her, woos in vain; I would not ask her for a bride, The wealth of worlds, if sure to gain; I laugh at love, and ladie's frowns, Neither can give this bosom pain: Liv'd she in farthest Chrissendie, I'd force her here, o'er land and main! 6 âFor Love can wound, without a scar; And Love can bind, without a chain; Mid' savage Winter's ruthless storms, Love finds his way o'er land and main; And he who bows to tyrant Love, His freedom never can regain: For Love can cause a thousand woes, And Love's the source of endless pain; Love's arrows pierce too many hearts, But now he bends his bow in vain! 7 âThe urchin, Love, with wily snares, May lure the fondling beardless boy; But soon he loads weak youth with cares, And every bliss wou'd fain annoy: Then why shall man bow to thy pow'r, That health and peace will quick destroy? âAh! little think'st thou, ladie fair, How soon I'll change thy cup of joy!â 8 Now he has gone to Tom o' Clint, âO Tom! good Tom, do favor me! Where Eden rowes to merry Carlyle, There stands a castle, it's name Corbye: Young Ellinor dwells in that castle, The fairest fair in Chrissendie; Her beauty wounds both lords and knights, Go, force her here, I ask of thee: I'll give thee house, I'll give thee land, And gold and silver shall be thy fee!â 9 The Clint has sworn a solemn oath, A solemn oath, most furiouslie, âGie' me thy hand, thou great Baron, By th' blood that warmeth this bodie! The proudest fair in a' Cumberland, Shall suin be here, gif thy will it be! 10 âAt thy command, the bonniest flow'r, That bloometh in a' Chrissendie, I'll mak her thine, but gin I fail, The Clint will forfeit life to thee! 11 âFor luive maks life a weary load; And luive, alake! is hard to bide; It gars man cla' a sairy pow, To see a jilt, fuils ca' a bride; And wae befa' the witless loon, Wha tamely bows to woman's pride, Better to hing on the gallows tree, Than tak fause woman for a guide! Here beats a heart, but ne'er for luiveâ Now quick thy errand I will ride; And ere to-morrow's sun gaes down, I'll seat the ladie by thy side!â 12 The Clint he mounted the swiftest steed, Regardless of the wintry show'r, The tempest wild, the foaming flood, He flew o'er mountain, moss, and moor; Quick as an arrow from the bow, By abbey, castle, hall, and tow'r; And where Eden rowes to merry Carlyle, He did espy a blooming flow'r; Who should it be, but fair Ellinor, As she was reading in her bow'r. 13 Ah! woe is me, that villain man E'er seeks such virtue to devour; Who parts with all the bliss of life, For the false pleasures of an hour! Forgetful of a future state, And heedless of the Ruling Pow'r, Whose goodness is for ever shewn To monarch proud, or thoughtless boor! 14 The Clint he kneel'd down to the ground, âCome, ladie fair, to the banks of Tyne! The Black Baron lacketh thy companie; His castles, lands, wull a' be thine: At his command, I ride this errand, While he sits drinking the bluid-red wine, Wi' courteous lords, and walthy knightsâ Say, ladie, shall his will be thine?â 15 The ladie started, as he spokeâ âShall Ellinor to such deeds incline! Go back! go back, vain is thy errand, I never will to the banks of Tyne! Where sits the murderer, the Black Baron, Reflection drowning with madd'ning wine; Where, daily in the dungeon deep, The virtuous starve, and vainly pineâ Be it proud castle; from that foul place, O God keep me! and God keep mine!â 16 The Clint he seiz'd her in his arms, And she grew weak, and she grew paleâ âO where! O where art thou, young Dacre! How little know'st thou what I ail! O wert thou near me, gallant Dacre! I need not thus my fate bewail!â But all her struggles, sighs, and tears, Alas! with him did nought avail! 17 Now when the Clint bound her lily hands, She shrieked loud, and she shrieked long; Her cries soon brought forth Andrew's Willie, Right stout he was, I ween, and strong; And with his staff, a full ell in length, He has fell'd the Clint, the grass among: âAy sic a deeth may he die!â quoth Willie, âThe loon wha con'd sic a ladie wrang!â 18 Next, he cut off the Clint's black head, And hung it on the highest tree; âThere wad I hing ilka head,â quoth Willie, âO' th' man wha'd harm our guid ladie!â The crows came east, the kites came west, The hawks came fast as they cou'd flee; They perch'd around the Clint's black head, And Willie stared the sight to see; But when they peck'd out the Clint's large eyes, Loud Willie laugh'd, as tho' mad were he. 19 He has thrown the body into Eden deep; âTroth! there's a ready-made grave for thee! Thus wad I bury thousands mair, Gin they sud harm our sweet ladie! Deil tak a' sic black-hearted loons, Wha glory in their crueltie!â 20 Now up the stream, and down the stream, The twisted eels swam greedily; And twined around the bleeding trunk, Like gluttons feasting furiouslie: And many a pike came darting forth, Eager to taste the Clint's bodie; And Willie stood on Eden's brink, And loud he laugh'd the sight to see. âDeil tak a' sic black-hearted loons, Wha glory in their crueltie!â 21 He has driv'n the steed far from the castle; O'er moor and mountain home flew he; When the Black Baron the steed beheld, I trow an angry man was he: He call'd his clan, he vow'd revenge, He made the table in flinders flee; And he has sworn three solemn oaths, That the Rose of Corbye his shall be. 22 âWho stoops to ladie, still she soorns; Who gently woos her, woos in vain; I would not ask her for a bride, The wealth of worlds, if sure to gain. A curse on Love, and ladie's frowns! Neither can give this bosom pain; Liv'd she in farthest Chrissendie, I'd force her soon o'er land and main! 23 âTho' Love can wound, without a scar, And Love can bind without a chain, His arrows pierce the coward's heart, But now he bends his bow in vain. What tho' mid Winter's thousand storms, He wings his way o'er land and main; Woe to the slave who bows to Love! Freedom he never can regain. Love sows the seeds of black despair In mighty king, or silly swain; But by the joys of life I prize, Love ne'er shall give this bosom pain!â 24 âDear Tom o' Clint! good Tom o' Clint! Perish the wretch who murder'd thee! Ere thrice the sun beams on this castle, Now thrice I swear reveng'd to be! Be who he will, the Baron's sword Shall draw the blood from his foul bodie! Tho' I command a fearless clan, Dearest of all wert thou to me!â 25 As Ellinor sat in her gilded chamber, Surrounded by her maidens gay, There came a letter from the Dacre, That he again must hunt that way; And three times did she read that letter, While blushes sweet did her thoughts betray. 26 And three times did she kiss that letter, And place it near her bosom white; But many a sigh that bosom heav'd, For still the Dacre was in her sight. Who would not cherish virtuous love? Its joys are pure, its cares are light; But who can say love's joys will last? The fairest flow'r a storm may blight. 27 For love is oft a load of woe, And love is oft a dang'rous snare; It makes time fly on leaden wings, And fills the breast with every care; It robs youth of the rose's hue, And plants a faded lily there: Love leads to bliss; love leads to pain; To heav'nly joys, or to dark despair. 28 Now she has sent for Andrew's Willie, And ordered him her swiftest steed; And the three best cows that graze around, And the three best fields wherein they feed: And she has giv'n him twenty merks, For they are good, in time of need; Saying, âThere's a youth in Cumberland, Will well reward thee for such a deed.â 29 Now Willie off his bonnet threw, And down he sunk on his bended knee; And Willie blush'd, and Willie star'd, And Willie laughed the sight to see; âI'd face the warl, and rejoice at deeth, Were it to sairve our guid ladie! The Deil waits a' black-hearted loons, Wha glory in their crueltie!â âRise, Willie, rise,â quoth fair Ellinor, âWhat thou hast done, will remember'd be.â 30 Why looks the Dacre so wan and pale? Alas! alas! how chang'd is he! He cannot eat, he cannot drink, He cannot sleep, or merry be! Brown Adam whispers, âGuid maister mine! To see ye thus, sair grieveth me! 'Tis a' for love o' the Corbye Rose, A hundred merks to ae penny! 31 Yes, love it causeth sleepless nights, And love it causeth days of pain; And when love robs us of our rest, 'Tis long ere we can rest again: It makes a coward of the hero bold, And binds him with a silken chain; Time only can relief afford, To struggle proves too oft in vain: From palac'd prince, to vassal vile, Mankind he tames, o'er earth and main. 32 âO woe is me!â said the feeble mother, âA-well-a-day! what ails my son! Thou lookest like one sick at heart, Or if thou had'st an ill deed done: A medicine strong will give thee rest, To Carlyle town, I'll send anon. O luckless hour, thou left this hall! A weary hunting thou hast gone! And griev'd am I, to hear thee sigh; Thy joys of life, alas! are done!' 33 âO chide me not, my good old mother! O heed me not, I beg of thee! Sick, sick at heart I am, I trow, But an ill-doer I hate to see! No med'cine healeth the wounded mind, Nor can it bring relief to me; For I must range both wood and wild, Ere well again I can hope to be!â 34 Now with his comrades, one and all, Young Dacre is a hunting gone; The dogs were swift, and the sports were good, But dogs or sport he heeded none, Tho' bounding deer, and fox, and hare, Ere noon they'd slain full many a one. Pleas'd he espie'd the Corbye woods, Just as the evening shades drew on; And thrice he knock'd loud at the ring, Where first his youthful heart was won. 35 Young Ellinor down from her maidens five, Quick to the castle gate is gone; And she has curtsey'd to young Dacre, And bid them welcome, one by one. She has giv'n to each the nut-brown ale, To the young Dacre she gave none, But a silver horn of the blood-red wine, And a smile, such as his heart first won; For fairer maid was never form'd, I trow, to grace proud monarch's throne: But one is more than monarch dear, Her thoughts are fix'd on one alone. 36 Now thrice he kiss'd her lily hand, And he has told her, with a sigh, A tale as sweet as e'er lover told, How, without her, he soon must die: She lighted him to the fairest chamber, Wherein the Dacre he might lie; But the grey cock crew, and thrice he crew, Love would not let him close an eye. 37 For when Love shoots his arrows keen, The lazy hours pass slow away; Toss'd on a sea, 'twixt hopes and fears, Love claims the night, Love claims the day: Love lends new joys, time quick destroys; Love changes every month to May; Love opes alike the proud palace gates, And the lowly latch of the shepherd gay: Love's arrows wound the world around, From rosy youth, to age grown grey! 38 And love is like the opening rose, When Phoebus ushers in the morn; Tho' fragrant blooms this queen of flow'rs, Its leaves conceal a piercing thorn: As fades the rose, when the bleak blast blows, So love is blighted by ladie's scorn! 39 And love is like a lily flow'r And love is like a feverish dream; A bitter draught it soon may turn, Tho' now life's luxury supreme! 40 A prey to love, the Dacre lies; No deeds of arms his soul delight; For she is all his thoughts by day, And she is all his thoughts by night: On mountain, moor, in hall, or bower, Fair Ellinor is in his sight: And now to view her matchless form, That captive led full many a knight, Oft did he chide the ling'ring hours, Oft did he wish for morning bright. 41 The gloomy night pac'd slow away, At op'ning dawn the Dacre rose; For who by Beauty captive led, Can hope for peace, or soft repose? Pleas'd he beheld fair Ellinor, Whose eye sleep tried in vain to close; He, sighing, sung a sonnet wild, Love was the theme the hero chose. SONG. Welcome to man is gay Spring's returning; Nature, ever beauteous, delights his view: Dearer to this fond bosom, burning, When that matchless grace I behold in you, Dearest treasure! Life's sole pleasure! This beating heart proves the Dacre true. Blithe sings the lark, when he hails the morning, Shaking from his wings the drops of dew; Thus blithe am I, all others scorning, Happy, happy still, when I gaze on you, Dearest treasure! Life's sole pleasure! Your smile can bless the Dacre true. Sweet bloom the flow'rs on the lap of Flora; Rapt in fond delight, we behold each hue: But the fairest flow'r on which beams Aurora, Tho' stern Winter reigns, yet I see in you, Dearest treasure! Life's sole pleasure! O look with pity on the Dacre true! 42 By love o'erpower'd, of speech bereft, Fair Ellinor her chamber sought; With frenzied gaze, the Dacre stood, Now sooth'd by hope, now sunk in thought: The languid look, the trembling frame, The tortur'd mind avail'd him nought. 43 The Dacre gaz'd, the Dacre sigh'd, With aching heart, and giddy head; In vain he struggled to be free; Life's pleasures all, alas! were fled: Forgotten are the feats of youth, When by his arm vain tyrants bled.â Leave we the hero for a while, By Love an easy captive led. 44 Yes! glory must to love give way; The brave to beauty still must bow; In vain we scorn the urchin bold, In vain to 'scape his snares we vow; The crimson'd cheek, and the eye of fire, Will drive a frown from the hero's brow; Who scorns the fairest of the fair, May soon a captive be, I trow; And he who was so bold of late, A willing slave, sits sighing now. 45 The golden morn gleam'd o'er the hills; The soaring lark did Phoebus call; Whose gladsome rays illum'd the woods, When the little Page look'd from the hall, And mounted on a palfrey grey, He spied a stranger, fierce and tall: Dark was his visage, sunk his eyes, And oft his steed was like to fall, For he spurr'd, and spurr'd the wearied steed, Until he came to the castle wall. 46 The weighty sword hung by his side, And black the armour the stranger wore; He lighted from his palfrey grey, Whose sides were wet with purple gore: With angry frown he gaz'd around; The little Page was troubled sore; And with the look of tyranny, He ey'd the Page now o'er and o'er. 47 And he has said to the little Page, âSweet boy! do thou but hearken me; Shew which chamber in this proud castle, It is, were sleeps thy fair ladie. I'm the Black Baron, of Northumberland, And fain young Ellinor would see; I'll make thee greater than a Page, And gold and silver shall be thy fee!â 48 The Page he frown'd, the Page he laugh'd, The Page he spake right angrily; âThink'st thou my ladie I would betray, For all the gold in Chrissendie! No!âKnow, Black Baron, my ladie's love, Is dearer, far, than gold to me: And woe awaits the luckless fair, Who wares a look of love on thee!â 49 The Baron took a silver whistle, And thrice he blew, both loud and clear, When one score men, and two score men Did quickly by his side appear; And he has said to the little Page, âThy proud reply, boy, shall cost thee dear: Thy aid to me, do but quickly lend, And thou thro' life hast nought to fear.â 50 The Page he laugh'd, the Page he frown'd, The Page he spake right angrily; âMy ladie hates thee, thou Black Baron, As I do thy gold, and thy silver fee! For wander east, or wander west, The widow's curse still follows thee! Who such a tyrant gives her hand, But binds herself to slaverie! There is a squire within this castle, A match for thee and thy companie!â 51 The Page he spake, but he spake no more; For, Oh! his life was at an end! âTake, take thee that!â quoth an angry loon, âPoor noisy worm! it will thee mend! Or man, or boy, who thus speaks our Baron, To heav'n, or hell, his soul I'll send!â 52 The Dacre from his window saw The bloody deed; quick down he came; âNow rise! now rise! my comrades all! Brown Adam! Andrew! Dick o' Graeme! Rise Johnstons! Armstrongs! and the Shaws! And all the rest that I could name; Rise! try your swords, that never fail'd, Fair Ellinor your help doth claim; And curs'd be he who will not rise, To save from harm an injur'd dame!â 53 When each had sworn to kill or die, The Dacre opened the castle gate, And he has said to the Black Baron, âThy strength I scorn! thy deeds I hate! Who stains his sword with virtue's gore, Will sore repent, when 'tis too late! 54 âCome on! come on! man to his man! Methinks it loss of time to wait; We fight the cause of a ladie fair, And for the rest, we trust to fate!â 55 The first who fell was the Black Baron; For the Dacre cleft his head in twain: Soon, of his luckless threescore men, Full forty on the ground lay slain: The rest sunk down; from many a wound The crimson tide pour'd out amain; Each look'd on Dacre, with a sigh, A brave man's mercy proud to gain. 56 âSpare! spare, and pity!â quoth the Dacre, âNo more their gore our swords shall stain; And may he who fights for a good ladie, Ne'er fear a foe, nor fight in vain! 57 âThe wounded gently bear to the hall, For need of help, I trow, have they; And some a grave dig wide and deep, And in it soon these dead men lay: The mangled corse of the Black Baron, Quick to his castle we will convey; And give due thanks to the King of kings, For favors he hath shewn this day!â 58 And Andrew's Willie, he was there, And loud he laugh'd, the sight to see; And fain the corse of the Black Baron He would have hung on the highest tree, Or thrown it into Eden deep, A feast for eels and pikes to be. The Dacre gave him a well-lin'd purse, For saving of our good ladie; And he has join'd the Dacre's clan, And a merry wight long may he be! 59 Now stepped forth ladie Ellinor, The bloody fray she had trembling seen; And she has knelt most fervently, And thanked heav'n, with uplifted een: The Dacre bending o'er her, sigh'd, And rais'd her, with a courteous mien. 60 From her fair finger she took a ring, And gave it the Dacre, with kisses three, Saying, âFor the deed thine arm hath done, The Lord of Corbye, thou shalt be.â But when she saw her lifeless Page, A sorrie ladie, I trow was she: âA-lack-a-day! my faithful boy! A Page so true, I ne'er hope to see!â She hung her head, pale grew her cheek, And many a tear fell from her e'e. 61 She has giv'n the Dacre her lily hand, And her lands that lay both far and wide; Again the red blooms on his cheeks, When he beholds so fair a bride: For she seem'd an angel, and no woman, With her maidens seated by her side; And fain will be the feeble mother, To hear what luck did her son betide. 62 Who would not cherish virtuous love, Its joys are pure, its cares are light; But who can say love's joys will last, The fairest flow'r a storm may blight: 63 For love is like a lily flow'r; And love is like a feverish dream; A bitter draught it soon may prove, Tho' now life's luxury supreme! 64 Now one by one the Dacre's clan Were welcomed into the hall, Where the tables groan'd with dainty fare, And blithe and merry, I trow were all: And old Grey Graeme, in his garb of green, Who still was ready at our ladie's call, Now with his harp was seated near, And loudly sang the Black Baron's fall; Whilst the castle echoed their revelrie, Till the grey cock thrice did on them call. 65 How eager sits his good old mother, Young Dacre watching, from tower high; And many with their children look, âThey suin wull come!â oft do they cry. They gaze along the woody glen, And over the hill, with eager eye, When swift and swifter o'er the moor, Foremost they see the Dacre fly. 66 âO God be prais'd!â says the feeble mother, âI count them all in safety nigh! And on grey palfrey array'd in white, Methinks an angel I espy!â 67 And when she kiss'd the Dacre's bride, She dropp'd an aged mother's tear; And when they told of what had pass'd, Rejoic'd was she, the tale to hear: âThrice happy day!â quoth the feeble mother, âThat gave my son a dame so dear!â âThrice happy day!â quoth the Dacre's clan, âWhen man to man, we knew no fear!â 68 Now safe arriv'd on the banks of Lyne, A father, mother, wife, they see, And there they drink the nut-brown ale, And tell their feats, with merry glee: For man to man, ne'er a border clan Cou'd fight the Dacre, and his companie. 69 He has to each brave comrade giv'n Both gold and silver, for a fee; But may the penny ne'er cross his purse, Who will not fight for a good ladie! And he whose heart is sunk in love, I wish him soon from trouble free! 70 For Love can wound without a scar; And Love can bind without a chain; Mid' savage Winter's frightful storms, Love finds his way o'er land and main: Love's arrows pierce the bravest heart, And soon subdue the proud and vain; And when man bows a slave to Love, 'Tis hard his freedom to regain, For the greatest trial man endures, Is lovely woman's cold disdain! 71 By day and night, Love wings his flight O'er barren heath, and flow'ry plain; Mid' Summer's heat, and Winter's cold, Love glories in his tyrant reign: He bends his bow, to wound the heart Of monarch proud, and lowly swain, But one kind glance from her we prize, Will freedom give, and banish pain! 72 O may this tale of former days But cheat the bosom of a sigh, How pleas'd will be the unknown Bard, Who boasteth not of minstrelsy! Tho' weak the tones of his broken harp, And he in song with few can vie, Fain would he sing in virtue's praise, And dry the tear from sorrow's eye; Tho' poverty hath bow'd him low, And the wise and wealthy pass him by. THE DYING HARPER. 1 The mavis sweet began to sing, And Corbye woods were turning green; When auld Grey Graeme grew sick at heart, Now fourscore Winters he had seen; And rest gat nane, A' strength was gane; Pale was his cheek, and sunk his een. 2 Quo' he, âLife's sand is weel nigh run, And last of a' the flock am I; But here's a leel, an honest heart, The stings o' conscience can defy: Life's but a day; We slip away; A' nature tells the reason why. 3 âIn vain we seegh and greet at death, When time has shorn an achin' pow; 'Tis painfu' to be ling'rin' here, When to the earth age maks us bow: I've had my share O' warldly care, And death comes wi' nae terrors now. 4 âWhen first I sa' yon castle wa', A blithesome sight it was to me; When last I sa' yon castle wa' The saut tear blinded aft my e'e: God's will be duin! Hope points abuin; And ay her smiles can comfort gie. 5 âHoarse-murm'ring Eden, sweet thy sounds Are borne on ilka passing gale; Aft I hae stray'd thy thick-wov'n woods, When Luna lighted hill and dale; O' days by-gane, In lightly strain, Ay fain to pour the true-tauld tale. 6 âDear windin' stream! thy soughin' flood Like friendship's voice, to me was sweet;â Nae mair thy murmurs maun I hear! Nae mair my friens on earth I'll meet! A fev'rish dream, A bubbling stream, Life proves at best a daily cheat! 7 Jeannet, my wife! blest saint abuin! The twentieth spring now decks the tree, Sin' thou tuik leave o' this warl's care, And laith was I to part wi' thee: I pin'd me lang, But that was wrang; We shou'dna weep at fate's decree! 8 âWi' thee, dear partner o' youth's joys, In realms o' bliss I lang to meet; And my five sons, slain by the Dane, O may they suin this spirit greet! The noon's braid light Fades frae my sight, And weak life's pulse begins to beat. 9 âCome hither, Coll!âAuld faithfu' dog! To lea' thee, O it maks me grieve! Thou monie a lesson gie'st proud man, For thou wilt serve, but ne'er deceive! When I am gane, There still is ane, Will ilka day thy wants relieve. 10 âYes, ane there is will send thee food, That angel fair wha plac'd me here; And ane there is will her reward, The virtuous mind hath nought to fear: Puir and distrest, She made me blestâ Flow on! flow on, thou gratefu' tear. 11 âFareweel, dumb frien! grown grey wi' years, Painfu' the thought that we maun part; May'st thou be buried by my side, This wish clings to my achin' heart: Thy paw gie me; Tears quat my ee; Thy moan e'en maks anither start! 12 âHand o'er my harp! guid Margery! And let me ance mair touch the string; To it, I sang o' former days, But nane of auld Grey Graeme will sing! Sweet harp! nae mair Thou'lt sooth ilk care! For me, there is nae second spring! 13 âO when I'm in my narrow bed, This harp hang high in Corbye Ha'! There monie a Winter we beguil'd, Nae snell blast heedin, sleet or snaw; And there, blest hour! When cauld, and puir, Fair Ellinor my een first saw! 14 âYes, Sol had westward driv'n his team, Some ither country to delight; And Boreas, wi' a thousand blasts, Bade welcome to the wintry night: The roarin' flood, The moanin wood, Might weel a timid mind affright! 15 âBut when the Empress o' the sky Rose stately o'er ilk murky cloud, An angel smile bade plenty chear The carle, by cauld and hunger bow'd: I thank kind heav'n! To me 'tis giv'n, To pay her yet wi' gratitude! 16 âBlest be the aged poor man's friend, Who owns a heart to feeling true! May happiness grow wi' her years, Nor sorrow ever cloud her brow! O were she near! O could she hear The Dying Harper's last adieu! 17 âTo soothe distress, wherever seen, What joy so pure beneath the sky? Heav'n has, for such, a gift in store, That this warl's wealth can never buy. Peace to their days, With each one's praise, Who wipe the tear frae misery's eye! 18 âFareweel, ye sheep upo' the hill! Nae mair ye'll hear the Harper's voice; Nae mair ye'll greet him wi' a bleet; Nae mair he'll pat ye, and rejoice! Wi' ye to stray, At closin' day, Was ay the leel auld Harper's choice! 19 âFareweel, ye buddin' wavin' woods! Ne'er, ne'er again ye'll shelter me; I watch'd ye grow, I've seen ye fa', And sa' a frien in ilka tree: Cropp'd in your prime, Or bow'd by time, Just sae, weak man's cut down, like ye! 20 âFareweel, my bonnie siller birks, Where monie an e'enin' hour I play'd! It is a leel auld Harper's wish, To rest his banes aneath your shade!â Weak grows my breathâ Come, welcome death! To quat this warl, I'm not afraid! 21 âThe wicked ne'er fan me a frien! The virtuous ne'er fan me a fae! A shamefu' deed ne'er flush'd my cheek, Ne'er caus'd within my bosom wae!â Receive me, God! Be my abode The mansion of eternal day!â 22 Without a moan, without a seegh, The leel auld Harper clos'd his een; And near his weel-lo'ed siller birks, There is a grave by monie seen: And on the hill, Close by the rill, The spot where Grey Graeme's but has been. 23 Fair Ellinor, the peerless dame, Had carv'd his virtues on a stane, At which the learn'd aft pore and seegh, And fancy words, where words are nane. Time a' destroys! Let us be wise! Anither day, perchance we're gane! CONNOR, A FRAGMENT, IN TWO CANTOS. Dear Philanthropy! first-born of Heaven! whatever my sufferings in this giddy world, never do thou forsake this bosom. I listen the child of sorrow's tale, and thou whisperest to me in a soothing voice, âHaste, dry the scalding tear, and bid the rose of joy banish the sickly lily of despair.â CANTO THE FIRST. 1 Night had drawn her sable curtain, Some three hours across the plain; From the hills the blast was raging, And in torrents fell the rain; Grey in years, and grey in sorrow, At a cabin in the vale, Dermot, trembling o'er the threshold, Sigh'd, and told his broken tale. 2 âWet and weary, dull and dreary, Home or comfort none have I; On the dark heath long I've wander'd, Not one star illumes the sky: The cheering blaze that gilds this cottage, Gave a ray of hope to me; O shield an old man from the tempest! Heav'n still smiles on charity.â 3 âWelcome!â cried a manly cottar, âWelcome to this lowly shed!â âMercy on thee!â said his fair one, âThou shalt share our board and bed! Age and trouble's bow'd thee double; Whiten'd locks thy years proclaim; Food and fire will quick revive thee, But, O say from whence you came?â 4 âI'm a wand'rer, dame believe me, Heedless where I bend my way; Now I sigh thro' gloomy vallies, Now o'er craggy mountains stray: Oft driv'n from the stately mansion; Oft partaking with the poor; Sometimes in an out-house resting; Sometimes wretched on a moor. 5 âHow dare man, e'en sunk in sadness, Blame the fix'd decrees of God! For me, tho' ofttimes driv'n to madness, Still resign'd, I kiss the rod: Bound I gaze, see many thousands, Who wou'd change their lot with mineâ Heav'n has blessings for each mortal, Never let me then repine. 6 âLife is but a vale of sorrow; Fleeting joys awhile we prize; Comfort now from Hope we borrow; Now the syren from us flies: Now we bow to pow'r, to riches; These, alas! the mind deceive; But at length experience teaches, Virtue only bliss can give. 7 âSince the blood-stain'd fiend, Rebellion, Stalk'd this dear-lov'd country round, I have dreamt of days departed, Nought but mis'ry have I found: Oft, alas! I'm reft of reason; Ah! how happy then am I! These dim eyes have done with weeping, Sorrow's fountains are run dry. 8 âThe faithful mistress of this bosom Long has moulder'd with the dead; I had friends, who smiling met me, Some are fall'n, and others fled: Busy memory, why distract me? Turn no more to manhood's joys; Greatest treasures, dearest pleasures, In a moment fate destroys. 9 âHalf my life the sport of fortune, Hopes I must not cherish here; Bent with age, its pains increasing, Man hath little left to fear: Stranger, wheresoe'er I wander, Kindred, friends, from me are torn; Yet, ev'n thus, a voice of soothing, Cries, âMan was not made to mourn!â 10 âI'd a cabin, seat of comfort, Where ne'er poor man ask'd in vain; Eager to diffuse each blessing, Eager to allay each pain: Many a helpless woe-worn stranger Shar'd my coarse but wholesome fare; Oft I saw the tear of pleasure, Oft I heard the earnest pray'r. 11 âIt was more than palace to me; There with health I hail'd the day; From the seat of happy childhood, Nought cou'd tempt me far to stray: Years returning gave new blessings; Joyous, where I first drew breath; There, in peace, had dwelt my fathers, There, I hop'd to welcome death. 12 âI had fields, I lov'd them dearly; I had sons for me who toil'd; Heav'n a daughter kindly gave me, Blooming like a rose-bud wild. Fiends of Hell soon burnt my cottage, Where youth's happy years were spent; Worse than fiends deflower'd my daughter, And to Heav'n that angel sent. 13 âSixteen Summers on the mountains, Scarce had danc'd the hours away; Till to earth we weeping bore her Fall'n to villain man a prey! Pow'r Supreme, who knew my feelings, Knew the murd'rers I forgave, How can man, thy image boasting, E'er forgetâ'Tis sweet to save? 14 âYet, methinks I see her dying, That was life's severest shock; âAh! how cou'd ye spare her father? Mercy did his grief but mock! The last words she feebly utter'd, Seem'd a pray'r to Heav'n for me; Bud of promise, early blighted, Had I bow'd to earth with thee! 15 âShed not for me tears of sorrow; Bitter pangs I'd yet to feel; My two manly sons were slaughter'd, By th' assassin's reeking steel! Free from anarchy and faction, Freedom tho' they dearly lov'd, Dark suspicion saw them virtuous; Such foul deeds stern Pow'r approv'd. 16 âBut my William! youngest, dearest, Doom'd in foreign climes to mourn! Exil'd youth! perhaps unpitied; Ne'er, ah! ne'er canst thou return! Durst I ask of God one blessing, On thee I would feast mine eye; Then forgetful of life's troubles, Connor soon in peace would die! 17 âTow'rds the fields I till'd, delighted, At to-morrow's dawn I'll bend; And trace the hill were stood my cottage; Ev'ry tree will seem a friend. From the sod that wraps her mother, Near were murder'd Mary lies, Nought on earth, I've sworn, shall tear me, Till death close my aching eyes!â 18 Wildly gaz'd the cottar, sighing; Oft in vain he strove to speak; Strong emotions tore his bosom; Manly tears bedew'd his cheeks: âSorrow's victim,â soft he utter'd, âHeav'n has heard thy fervent pray'r; Mark thy son who bows before thee; Henceforth thou shalt be our care. 19 âLong-lost parent now I've found thee, Never, never more we'll part! This lov'd wife thy age will nourish, Watch thee, with a feeling heart! Lambs at rest, shall each, when waking, Bless a grandsire with a kiss.ââ âHeav'nly Father! let us thank thee, For this scene of unhop'd bliss!â END OF CANTO FIRST. CANTO THE SECOND. 1 O'er the fruitful vales of Erin Glanc'd the broad-fac'd god of day; Cottars to their early labour, Whistl'd trifling cares away: Plenty wav'd her golden treasure, Blest reward for human toil; Nought was heard but joyous pleasure, Nought was seen but nature's smile. 2 Redbreasts, sweet domestic songsters, Hymn'd with joy the grey-ey'd morn; Dew drops spangl'd hedge and meadow, Glisten'd on the bending corn: Near the mill, his females round him, Stately strode brisk chanticleer; From lone cot and busy village, Rural sounds burst on the ear. 3 Happy Isle! all isles excelling, Little known, tho' much despis'd, Where contentment rules each dwelling, And domestic bliss is priz'd; Hospitality, delighted, Smiles benignant o'er thy plains; While by Shamrock wreathes united, Honour marks thy hardy swains. 4 Ne'er may foreign foes deceive thee, Isle that boasts the wise and brave; Ne'er that dauntless spirit leave thee Ling'ring to a coward's grave! While thy sons in ev'ry danger, Pour destruction on each foe, May thy daughters from a stranger Ne'er receive a cup of woe!) 5 Such the time, when William, rising, Pour'd to Heav'n his daily pray'r; While the partner of his bosom, Trimm'd the hearth with thrifty care: Oft they mark'd the grief-worn furrows On poor Dermot's aged cheek; Fearful to disturb his slumbers, Oft they would, but durst not speak. 6 Blest with two sweet buds of promise, Pictures fair of roseate health, Pledges of each fond affection, Dearer far to both than wealth; Many a glance towards the stranger, Did they give, with asking eyes; Eager for a grandsire's blessing, Anxious to behold him rise. 7 âSleep, thou soother of dejection, Nature's balm for ev'ry woe, Health's restorer, care's beguiler, All our joys to thee we owe; Dear to him who rules a palace; Dear to him who bows a slave; Dearer to the son of sorrow, Than all wealth or pow'r e'er gave!â 8 Thus reflected William, sighing, O'er the author of his birth; Rapt in mute attention near him, Wonder check'd the children's mirth: From his cheek, unmark'd by wrinkles, Oft he wip'd the tear of joy; Doubtful that new scenes of anguish Wou'd each bud of hope destroy. 9 Dermot rose, with hands uplifted, Thankful for the light of day; âWhere, where am I!â sigh'd he feebly, âDo these eyes my mind betray? Ah! no! no! my William's near me, With the thought reviv'd I seem; This repays long years of suffering, And the past seems all a dream! 10 âThou, my daughter, may misfortune Ne'er thro' life once bow thy head! Sweet thy welcome to the stranger, ââThou shallt share our board and bed!â Oft she press'd him to her bosom, While a smile of joy was giv'n, Such as marks a pitying angel, When the wretched enter Heav'n. 11 Soon prepar'd, the wholesome breakfast Susan places; with a smile, Each intreats the feeble father, Each his cares wou'd fain beguile: Kissing oft the mother's image, Blessing oft the blooming boy, Sighs now stifle words half utter'd, Now he sheds the tear of joy. 12 Much he long'd to quit the cottage; Anxious ere the evening hour, To mark the grave that hides his partner, And his Mary, luckless flow'r! There the aged man oft wander'd, And a vent to sorrow gave, There on happy days oft ponder'd, Weeping o'er each well-known grave. 13 Susan saw the father, husband, Climb the steep hills rugged brow; Oft they turn, and gaze enraptur'd, On the whiten'd cot below: William's arm his sire supported, Winding many a hill and daleâ 'Neath a spreading beech tree resting, Thus the son relates his tale. 14 âFather, since with thee I parted, I have felt of woes my share; From the treach'rous foe oft skulking, Wand'ring, scarcely knowing where: For my yet-lov'd bleeding country, Never once afraid to die; Guiltless prov'd, and still undaunted, Pow'r, not justice, bade me fly. 15 âOh! 'twas hard to quit the valley, And each scene dear to the heart; Harder still to lose my fair one, When she utter'dââMust we part? Exil'd far from green-hill'd Erin, Fairer dames thou may'st pursue; Robb'd of thee, poor orphan Susan Will to pleasure bid adieu!' 16 âAll the pangs of grief at parting, When two hearts in union join, Bound by love, and urg'd by virtue, All these pangs of grief were mine. Forc'd on board, with many a brother, Nought of joy, alas! remain'd, Tho' my mind ne'er vice had cherish'd, Nor my hand with blood was stain'd. 17 âWhen the star of morning beaming, Signal gave of day's bright dawn, Oft I trac'd the deck dejected, Mus'd on joys forever flown; Or when murky tempests lower'd, Drenching my weak shiv'ring frame, I wou'd pray for thee, my father, Sigh, and think myself to blame. 18 âBorne across the wide Atlantic, Friendless, wretched, doom'd to pine; Days of ceaseless toil and anguish, Nights of mis'ry long were mine: Still a ray of hope smil'd on me, When my weary toil was o'er, Oft I climb'd the highest mountain, Oft I gaz'd tow'rds Erin's shore. 19 âFancy, various pictures painting, Sometimes fill'd my heart with grief; Sometimes in a sportive humour, Gave my wounded mind relief: When the shades of night clos'd round me, Forc'd to seek my wretched home, I'd no friend to bid me welcome, Tho' by toil, by thought o'ercome. 20 âSpirits ebbing, health decaying, Life seem'd drawing near its close; One dear comrade driv'n from Erin, Brought my aching heart repose; Yes, he smiling told how Susan Liv'd for William, fond and true; But the transient gleam quick vanish'd, When no tidings came from you. 21 âLong I shar'd his liberal bounty, He my guardian angel prov'd, Till the time rejoicing exiles Sought the homes and friends they lov'd: He it was to Erin brought me, Plac'd me on our little farm; Gave to me the maid endearing, Thus had life yet pow'r to charm. 22 âNeed I mention Cormac to thee? Him I found this man of worth ââ Dermot hung his head deep sighing, This call'd many a sorrow forth. Cormac sought the hand of Mary; Love smil'd on the happy pair: Man to-day each pleasure tasting, Mourns to-morrow joys that were. 23 âFather, I'll no more distress thee, With the hardships I endur'd; Meek religion ne'er forsook me, When to ev'ry ill inur'd: Changes wish'd in war-spoil'd Erin, Brought safe o'er thy long-lost son; Time restor'd my welcome fatherâ God is just!âHis will be done!â FAIR MARGARET'S BOWER. IN THREE CANTOS CANTO THE FIRST. 1 âGo saddle me the milk-white steed, In costly proud array; My errand do with mickle speed, And three times fleeter than the wind, Tho' day is fled, my path I'll find To Margaret's Bower.âAway! away! 2 âFor I have dreamt a frightful dream; For I a solemn oath have sworn, Spite of the flood, to cross the stream, And pull a rose at Margaret's Bower, That blooms like her, a matchless flower, Ere thrice the cock proclaims the morn.â 3 Thus to his groom, Sir Edward said, All in his gilded hall; 'Twas his the feeble still to aid, For knight more courteous and brave, Ne'er scorn'd the name of coward slave; Tho' he would fight, but never flee, Mild as the mountain lamb was he, And Margaret of the east country, Whom nobles woo'd, And many sue'd, Did long his heart enthrall. 4 Then up, and spake the little page, His eye let fall a tear; âIf e'er you deign'd to hear a page, Your trusty page now hear: O list! O list to me! Upon my bended knee, I do beseech you, tarry here! Venture not forth, good master dear! Cold, dark, and angry is the night, Nor lends one star its feeble light; Deep is the flood, Dang'rous the wood; O go not forth!â quoth he. 5 âPeace, peace, thou little trembling page, Nor drop a tear for me! I ne'er took counsel of a page, Nor will I now of thee! The bleakest blast I'd boldly brave, Or cross the highest white-topp'd wave, Nor heed the angry storms of night, Tho' not one star lends me its light, The peerless maid I'll see. 6 âI'll hear her voice, ere rise the moon, If Heaven doth me spare; For by her beauteous matchless face, And by her artless winning grace, Now solemnly I swear, Ne'er, ne'er did sun or pale-fac'd moon Shine on a face so fair!â 7 The milk-white steed Now prancing neigh'd, His mane shook with the wind; Loud blew the blast, down came the shower, But many a lofty lonely tower, He soon left far behind: And many a deep-ton'd castle bell Told him each hour in distant dell. 8 'Twas tempest all, and all was dark, Save from the steed's feet many a spark; Thro' mossy glens, and soughing woods, Mid' rugged rocks, and roaring floods, O'er mountains wild, and moors he flew; And pluck'd a rose at Margaret's Bower, That bloom'd like her, the sweetest flower, Long ere the grey-cock crew. 9 And now below the Bower window, Without or dread or fear, He anxious listens, pacing slow, All expectation, breathing low, It was her voice!âAh no! Ah no! That well-known voice he cannot hear. 10 âAwake, fair Margaret, awake! All silent is around, Save many a watch-dog's far-heard voice, And Tyne's hoarse-murmuring sound: Far have I wander'd for thy sake, Awake, awake, blest choice! The pale moon resteth on the hill, Then bid thy true love now rejoice, And haste to him who loves thee still! 11 âO dear Margaret! O fair Margaret! Thy true-love calls on thee! O fair Margaret! O dear Margaret! Come quickly down to me! 12 âThy father is perchance at rest, And nought, methinks, hast thou to dread; Fly, fly to him who loves thee best, A captive by thy beauty led; 'Tis Edward calls on thee! Ere day's bright dawn We'll far begone, To-morrow's sun Will see us one; Think of thy vows to me!â 13 âWhat voice is that, which bids her rise?â In whispers low, a stranger cries; âWho dare on Margaret call? I swear by yon bright lamp of night, Ruin awaits the luckless wight; He ne'er will see the morning light, But by this arm shall fall!â 14 âO dear Margaret! O fair Margaret! Again I call on thee! Maid of my love, Thy faith now prove! And pity shew to me!â 15 Enrag'd, his sword the stranger drew; Ah! wretch, the deed long wilt thou rue! Deep, deep it drank life's purple gore; Like some mute victim doom'd to bleed, The dauntless youth now struggl'd sore, But thought not who had done the deed: Sir Edward fell, his country's pride, On Margaret call'd, his promis'd bride; âFor thee I bleed!â he said and sigh'd, But word spake never more. END OF CANTO FIRST. CANTO THE SECOND. 1 Above the grey-hills of the East, Blithe morning smil'd in saffron drest, With silver dew besprent; When Margaret left her chamber fair, O that she'd ne'er been pillow'd there! Pale wretched child of love and care, Alas! a weary night she spent. 2 Why didst thou, Margaret, leave thy bower, To rest thee in thy chamber fair? O had'st thou ne'er been pillow'd there, Poor hapless child of love and care! Was it the tempest of the night That did thy anxious mind affright? True to his vow, Sir Edward flew; Spite of loud wind, or heavy shower, He came at love's appointed hour, To pluck the rose at Margaret's Bower. 3 Scarce sleep, the soother of each woe, Had clos'd her eyes of azure hue, When various ghastly forms she saw Flit hideous to her fancied view; The owl next at her casement flapp'd, The raven hoarsely scream'd aloud: Her tortur'd breast Could hope no rest, For cross the room Sir Edward stepp'd, And near her stood, All bath'd in blood, Clad only in a shroud. 4 And now, to rise, she strove in vain; Alas! disorder'd was her brain; Then fainting on the floor she fell: The morning smil'd on her pale cheek, Fled was the bloom, sweet maiden meek, Whom many a suitor lov'd too well! She rose, her tresses bath'd in tears, But all her hopes, her pains, her fears, No pen can paint, no tongue can tell. 5 Now for her father, in the hall, Loud, and louder did she cry; But echo round each massy wall, Only made a long reply. 6 âAh! whither, father, art thou gone? Who will now my grief allay? I ne'er was wont to be alone; But at this early hour of day, When with thy Margaret all was gay!â 7 Now for her father in the glen, Loud, and louder did she cry; But echo from her darken'd den, Only made a long reply. 8 âCome hither, little trembling page, All wan and pale, what aileth thee? Why dost thou weep, boy? speak my page! What heavy tidings bring'st thou me? From either eye there falls a tear, Alas! thy tale I fain would hear; Say, trembling page, what aileth thee?â The boy he wept, the boy he sigh'd, In vain to speak the boy oft tried. 9 Now for her father in the wood, Loud, and louder did she cry; The passing stream, the distant flood, Only made a deep reply. 10 She thought not of her rosy Bower, But sought the highest western tower, And eager gaz'd around; But nought could see, Save moor and tree, And scatter'd flocks upon the lea: Tho' great her fear, She nought could hear, Save Tyne's hoarse-murm'ring sound. 11 âMethinks, I see in yonder vale My father slowly come this way; Alas! no father's in the vale; Where can he be? What can he ail? Distraction doth my thoughts betray!â 12 Again she look'd, and near the Bow'r, Beheld a mile-white steed Bend o'er a corse; Ah! luckless hour! She little dreamt who had the pow'r To do the hellish deed. 13 As darts a mountain eagle down, She from the castle flew; But every hope forsook her, soon As she Sir Edward knew: On his pale face, and gory breast, She sunk, and oft his cold lips prest, And oft did Edward call: Alas! what some are doom'd to know, What trials mortals undergo! Now from her eyes, quite dim with woe, Love's last sad tears did fall. 14 Soon, soon in wild despair, The silver pin from her fair hair, She took, and piere'd her heart: His bleeding corse she dying prest, Life's current quickly left her breast; âEdward!â she cried, âI come, my love! The joys denied, we yet may prove! We meet no more to part!â END OF CANTO SECOND. CANTO THE THIRD. 1 âSir Hugh! Fair Margaret! Sir Hugh!â The servants call around; In vain, Fair Margaret, Sir Hugh, Around the servants loudly call, Deep echo round each ivied wall, Did only mock the sound. 2 âWhere goest thou, little trembling page? Pale is thy face, what aileth thee? Why dost thou weep? Speak quickly, page?â He sighing said, âAh! follow me!â 3 He led them to his lady's Bower, And first they saw a milk-white horse; And next, they saw a faded flower Embrace her lover's stiffen'd corse: Sad was the sight, each shrunk to view Fair Margaret slain, Alas! what pain 'Twill cause her father, proud Sir Hugh! 4 His bowmen on Sir Edward call, And mourn along the glen; The maidens from the gilded hall, Now on the highest castle wall, Look and sigh, but all in vain. 5 Weep, weep, ye hardy bowmen bold; Mourn, mourn, along the glen; Ye maidens, quit the castle wall, Go hang with black the gilded hall; Your master's manly form is cold, And long with sorrow 'twill be told, How all untimely he was slain. 6 The trusty band range thro' the wood, And careful seek the gloomy dale; Now sound in vain the dark deep flood, Now eye the far extended vale, Then search the forest thro'; When 'neath a wither'd pine tree stood The murderer, Sir Hugh. 7 âOh! misery! Oh! misery! No happiness is left for me!â 8 âWhat ho! Who's he that moans so loud? What ails thee? Say, thou baron proud? Thy face is wan and thin! Thy teeth they chatter, eyes are sunk, Thy body from they garb is shrunk! Who art thou? say? A-well-a-day! Thy bones have cut the skin!â 9 âOh! misery! Oh! misery! Sir Edward's murderer you see!â 10 âO mercy! Canst thou hope for rest? No! no! Hell rages in thy breast! Soon wither'd be thy coward arm, That slew a knight so bold; And nipt Northumbria's fairest flower, A maid possest of every charmâ Thy daughter, wretch, lies cold, Near her own Bower!â 11 âOh! misery! Oh! misery! One hellish deed has ruin'd me!â 12 âSpeak, man of guilt, and say, Dost see his ghost ride on the storm? Or thy fair daughter's saint-like form? Yes! yes! and conscience, gnawing worm, On thee doth keenly prey!â 13 âOh! misery! Oh! misery! There is no hope, alas! for me!â 14 âThou tremblest, now thine eye-balls roll; Methinks we see the sinner die: Peace, murderer, to thy troubled soul! The ravens smell thy carcase foul, But screaming from thee fly!â 15 âOh! misery! Oh! misery! The grave can give no rest to me!â 16 âFor thee, no one will dig a grave! For thee, no one will wail or weep! No grass will o'er that body wave, Base murderer of the good and brave! Still far, far from thy whiten'd bones, That moulder mid' the heath's grey stones, The traveller will keep: And babes unborn their babes will tell The deed of base Sir Hugh; How by thy arm Sir Edward fell: And hoary minstrels in the hall, Or near the ivied castle wall, Will strike the string, and curse the hour, And loudly sing of Margaret's Bowerâ Thou man of guilt, adieu!â THE HARPER. âTo music we are indebted for one of the purest and most refined pleasures that the bounty of Heaven has permitted to cheer the heart of man.â Sturm. âAnd frae his harp sic strains did flow, Might rous'd the slumb'ring dead to hear.â Burns. 1 Alake! that the harp is nae langer heard, Beguilin' the lee-lang night! Its tones the heart can bind, And ease the wounded mind; Ne'er, ne'er can I count him a friend to mankind, Whase saul it fails to delight! 2 Auld Scotia, still is thy music dear, It minds us o' times that were: By it thy sons are led, Aft to a gory bed, Ay freedom defendin', nae haughty foe they dread, And it lightens ilk cottar's care. 3 Come list, and ye's hear of a blithe Harper, Wha cam to our Baron's Ha'; O he tickled ilka string, And made the auld Ha' ring; His music was fittin' for the ear of a king, And it pleas'd our young ladies a'. 4 Aft had merry minstrels in this Ha', In praise o' heroes sung; While aloft the massy shield, And sword but few could wield, That aft had been stain'd in the Border field, Wi' hauberk and helmet hung. 5 A bonnet o' the green he wore down to his een, And lang was his beard, and brown; He was cloak'd frae head to heel, Frae his lips when words did steal, Sae gently he spak, that it shew'd fu' weel, He monie better days had known. 6 And now, aloud he tun'd his harp to war, Wild and mournfu' was the strain; Then of fae-men he sang, And the trumpet's chang, It seem'd, as he swept the strings amang; O but our auld Baron was fain! 7 For it brought fresh to mind the days o' his youth, When to the English Borders he flew; And aft in Lydisdale, He made widows wan and pale, For he heeded nae proud borderer, or baron in mail, But age had now whiten'd his pow. 8 To love, wi' a sigh, he gae his saftest note, And sweet, O sweet was the sound; Then he sang o' maidens fair, And o' lovers sad despair, How thearrows o' the urchin cause mickle, mickle care, And deadly aft proves the wound. 9 Then of dames forsaken by proud fause knights, Maist dirge-like chaunted he; Sae weel he play'd his part, He touch'd deeply ilka heart, And tears frae the een now of a' 'gan to start, Save those o' our Baron's cross ladie. 10 For proud was her heart, and whene'er she spak, The dark frown hung on her brow; Ay haughty was her mind, Ne'er felt she for mankind; But yet to a' her fauts the guid Baron was blind, And sae the sweet dochters I trow. 11 She has ey'd the Harper, wi' monie a scornfu' luik That spak him nae welcome guest, âA'ye, to whom great Heav'n Baith health and walth has giv'n, Shield, shield the weary wanderer by monie a sorrow driv'n; Ay bless, as ye hope to be blest! 12 âWhare comest thou frae, thou Harper puir and mean? What ill deed has brought thee here?â âI come o'er hight and howe, But for nae ill deed, I vow; And my kin hae been whiles thought walthy I trow, But a lang tale might tire your nice ear! 13 âMickle cou'd I tell o' this sly wicked warl, Whare folk ca'd great are aft to blame; I've seen virtue meanly clad, And fore'd to beg for bread; While vice strutted lordly, and wore a haughty head, But mair I perchance mauna name. 14 âSae gie me some meat, and gie me some drink, And a bed whereon to lie; For, alake! I am but puir, Mickle, mickle I endure; Far, far hae I wander'd o'er moss and o'er muir, And hungry, weary am I!â 15 Lady Ellinor brought him the bluid-red wine; Lady Margaret sought him meat: But the youngest, Lady Jean, Gied a glance wi' her een, That shone bright as onie starnies i' the sky, I ween, Woo but this made his leel heart beat. 16 For ne'er did a minstrel frae north or south Gaze heedless on beauty's charms: Ae saft bewitchin' smile, Whare the heart seems void o' guile, Maks proud man cast his cares to the winds for a while, And a savage o' his rage it disarms. 17 Then spak, wi' a smile, our guid auld Baron, To his sullen and sour ladie; âSince puirtith is nae sin, And far he canna win, The Harper ae night shall sleep our Ha' within, My ladie, if thy will it be.â 18 Now wi' a frown, she has answer'd the Baron, âNae Harper, I trow, shall sleep here! He may rest i' the fauld, The night is no' sae cauld; And if weary, I guess he's no' sae auldâ A beggar has nought to fear!â 19 Lady Jean whisper'd o'er her left shoulder, âSleep, sleep i' the fauld!â says she, âFor mild is the night, And if I hae but might, Lang ere the siller muin shews a glimpse o' light, God save me, love, I'll meet thee!â 20 Wi' a lang luik o' luive, he crap aff to the fauld, But ne'er ance did sleep close his e'e; The night grew cauld and snell, And he said to himsel, Wi' monie a deep sigh, when he heard the midnight bell, âWhy comest thou not, ladie, to me?â 21 âO woman, woman, cause o' man's greatest joy, And source o' mickle grief and pain; Now you mak him coward, slave, Now ilk doughty deed he'll brave; Wha heeds you, may e'en trust the fickle wind or wave, Ne'er, I swear, shall you tempt me again! 22 âAnd lang or the muin gies a glimpse o' light, God save me, luive, I'll meet thee! Saft were her words, and sweet, They made this proud heart beat; Thou muin, yet dinna rise! methinks I hear her feetâ No!âFause were her sweet words to me!â 23 The first cock crew, silence reign'd i' the Ha'; Lady Jean left her sisters asleep; Bare-footed, down the stair, Saftly stept the ladie fair, And unbelted the gate o' the Ha', wi' mickle care, Her promise fu' fain to keep. 24 She's aff to the fauld, wi' a beatin' heart, Syne awa' wi' the Harper is gane; Wi' a kiss, and monie a vow, His plaid o'er her he threw, And he luiked like a gallant young lord, I trow, Wi' a sword monie a faeman had slain. 25 Now bright shone the muin o'er the misty hills, And white were the meads wi' dew; Lady Jean, wi monie fears, Thinks the Baron's voice she hears, And her mither's angry chide aft rings thro' her ears: O love! thy cares are not few! 26 O'er mountains high, o'er monie a moss and muir, They journey'd, or break o' day; When in a flowery vale, Quite weary, faint, and pale, Lady Jean sat her down, and mickle did she ail, Nae farther, alake! could she gae. 27 Wi' dew on his breast, the lark had left his nest, To greet the blithe god o' the morn; The wild birds saftly sang, The neigbrin' woods amang, âO cou'dst thou,â quoth the Harper, âbut o'er yon mountains gang, A' thy father's swift steeds would I scorn! 28 âThat I've lo'ed lang, that I've lo'ed weel, The pangs o' this bosom can prove; What man dare, I would dare; What he cou'd bear, I'd bear, And laugh at the threats o' the warl, and ilka care, A' for thee, sweet maid o' my love!â 29 âTho' rash was the deed I hae duin,â quoth she, âThat deed I scorn to rue; If by Fate it were decreed, Thy Jean shou'd beg for bread, A' the ills o' pale poverty I'd bear without dread, Were my Harper but leel and true!â 30 He sigh'd, and his eye spoke his feeling soul, While it rov'd o'er each peerless charm; Not the dew-bespangl'd rose, Not the purest mountain snows Cou'd rival her face, which nature proudly chose To combine wi' an angel's form. 31 And now wi' the sun rose the Baron and his clan, And he ca'd for his dochters three; Lady Ellinor he saw, Lady Margaret and a', But the flow'r o' them a', Lady Jean was awa', And an angry man was he. 32 âFie, ride, run!â said he, âbaith east and west, Nor seek ye lang in vain! Bring them back to me, And on the highest tree, Of a' the proud forest, suin he hanged shall be, For stcalin' awa' Lady Jean! 33 But much did he fear his scornfu' dame, Whase luik spak a gathering storm; Tho' to man great pow'r is giv'n, Great masterpiece of Heav'n, Yet howe'er he to rage by misfortune may be driv'n, Let him yield to the female form. 34 Then some ran east, and some rade west, When down in a flowery glen, Lady Jean they espied, Seated by her lover's side; And to please her, aft wi' his harp has he tried, In monie a merry lilting strain. 35 âSay what do ye here? thou fause Harper, Wi' us gae back to the Ha'; By the Baron sent are we, And on the highest tree, Of a' the proud forest, thou hanged wilt be, For stealin' our ladie awa'!â 36 Says the Harper, âSpare your mistress fair, For weary and faint is she!â âOur mistress we will spare, Tho' thoughtless as she's fair, And back to the Baron convey wi' mickle care, But an ill death waiteth thee!â 37 âGae hame to the Baron, and tell your fuil's errand, Nor waste monie words on the blast; Aff hirelings! aff, nor dare To touch the ladie fair; Or by a puir Harper's faith and troth I swear, This day ye may count your last!â 38 Then the Harper loudly leugh, as he rase, âGae tell Baron Sessfoorth frae me, The Harper nit to blame, I hae duin nae deed o' shame, And for every castle or tower he can name, To his dochter I'll gie three! 39 âAnd tell,â said he, âyour sullen ladie, Nae mair a puir Harper to scauld; Tho' his claithing seem'd but mean, Weel he's lo'ed by lady Jean, And had monie a glance o' her bonnie blue een, Twa years ere he laid i' the fauld!â 40 He tuik ladie Jean by the lily saft hand, And thrice kiss'd her cheek the while; âFear not!â he sighin' cried, âWhate'er may us betide; I swear by this sword, nought shall our hearts divide,â Then she gied him a saint-like smile. 41 He has stript aff his cloak frae head to heel, And woo but he luiked bra'! For his hose were silken fine, And his studded star did shine, It prov'd that he cam of a noble line, Tho' a Harper he seem'd at the Ha'. 42 âNow mount thy father's steed, sweet ladie fair, And to my castle let us gae; This night shall see us one, And ere the setting sun, Thy parents bless the time, when awa' thou didst run, In the mirk hour o' night, wi' the Douglas' eldest son, And thy lord on his harp will sweetly play; 43 âBut if e'er proud minstrel frae north or south Gaze heedless on beauty's charms, I count him sinner vile: Ae saft bewitchin' smile, Wi' a fond luik o' luive, frae a heart void o' guile, Shou'd mak man cast his cares to the winds for a while; E'en a savage o' his rage it disarms!â 44 Alake, that the harp is sae seldom heard, Beguilin' the lee-lang night! Its tones the heart can bind, And socthe the wounded mind; In sorrow's darkest hour frae it we comfort find, And ne'er will I count him a friend to mankind, Whase saul it fails to delight! 45 Auld Scotia, still is thy music dear; It minds us o' times that were: By it thy sons are led, Aft to a gory bed, Ay freedom defendin', nae haughty foe they dread; LIt saftens monie a heart, and aft the tear is shed, As it lightens the cottar's care! ENIGMAS. ENIGMA THE FIRST. On publishing this and the two following, in the Belfast Commercial Chronicle, the scribblers and pedants throughout the neighbourhood were seized with an Enigmatic Fever, which raged for a considerable time, to the great mortification of the enlightened public. The Author became disgusted with the numerous and laughable communications he daily received, supposed to be ingenious solutions. No. 1. Starch, was answered throughout, by Mr.T.Falconer, Comedian, of the Belfast Theatre, in verse. The three following remain unanswered. Who made me first, when, where, but few can tell, Tho' I'm made daily for each beau and belle; And in most countries found, such is my lot, From the proud palace to the lowly cot. I owe my being to the ploughman's toil; He views me oft in summer with a smile: Next I surround the bosoms of the fair, Would I could guard them from the villain's snare! By beauties in most climes am I carest, And oft have won them lovers, 'tis confest: I to deformity add many a charm; Tho' base the coin, it does the world no harm. I'm in complexion fairer far than you, Nor is my shape to ought confin'd, I vow. Short is my date, perhaps an hour, a year, And when I'm put to use I disappear. A drop of water quick my form will change, But keep me dry, throughout the world I'll range: I'm hot, I'm cold; let this not cause alarm; Eat me, or drink me, faith I'll do no harm, Yon supple tradesman calls me to his aid, And for his blooming lovey I was made; Their dear-lov'd cherubs, too, find me of use; And shop-boy Jacky, strutting, pert and spruce. I rustle thro' the ball-room 'midst the proud, Nor yet am seen by any of the crowd; I'm in the park, parade, and at the play, In churches, eke in chapels, every day: You meet me every minute in each street, But you're too proud to know me when we meet. In eastern climates I'm at each one's call, In Norway, Lapland, I'm scarce known at all. The lawyer, doctor, vicar I attend, And have been thought a judge's, bishop's friend: Old maids, old bachelors, my influence own; I'm next the king, God bless him! on his throne. That I was used by Scotia's beauteous queen, And by her murd'rous cousin, may be seen: Yea, each proud potentate, and gay grandee, Must shew their pow'r accompanied by me. The cloister'd nun admits me to her cell, And in some dungeons I'm allow'd to dwell: By proud, by wise, o'er Europe am I borne, Yet still am I the lonely hermit's scorn. Erin, a faithful friend I prove to thee, Tho' thousands of thy sons are dup'd by me; For I a knave have been, in many a clime, And will remain so till the end of time. I wonder oft mankind e'er think about me, When just as well all ranks could do without me. I'm but a word. My meaning quick explain; Come, study; bite your nails, then try again. One half of me is brought far o'er the wavesâ One half of me our dear-lov'd country savesâ One half a glorious act or base may meanâ One third contempt or pity shews, I weenâ One half of me an useful tree will form; It shelters many a rustic from the stormâ From half of me an heroine was nam'd, Whose death made British cruelty much blam'd; That half of me did ere the flood appear, And but for it, thou hadst not now been here. Two thirds of me is many a courtier's prideâ Two thirds oft seen with monarchs, side by sideâ Two thirds of me the traveller greets with joyâ Two thirds the seaman's mind doth oft employâ Two thirds of me delight this earthly ballâ Two thirds of me caus'd gallant Nelson's fallâ Two thirds of me is each free-mason's boastâ Two thirds of me is oft his heart-warm toastâ Two thirds of me the curious view with aweâ Two thirds of me make man your dang'rous foeâ Two thirds of me support you o'er the flood; Yet am I useless, rightly understoodâ Two thirds of me delight a sland'rous crew, And yet it entertains the virtuous tooâ Two thirds shew what our warriors for you bearâ O brethren, let them ever be your care! Transpose me now, and soon perchance you'll find What proves a benefit to all mankind; By what old Albion is to glory led; What 'tis secures her sons their daily bread; What Greece and Rome for ages thought their own, And what to many a country's yet unknown. Transpose me, and you'll see a rising ground, By tyrants rear'd, throughout Hibernia found. Transpose me, and I soon become a fish, Deem'd by each epicure a dainty dish; 'Tis not in Ireland found; not in the sea; Not in the riverâPray, where can it be? Transpose me, every danger I defy. Transpose me, and as useless dross I lie. Transpose me, I'm what various metals are; Or like a guilty felon at the bar. Transpose me, I'm the idol of mankind, And hourly influence the noblest mind. I'm source of many a pleasure, many a pain; And hurl destruction o'er both land and main. I caus'd Parisian blood in streams to flow, And struck at monarchy the fatal blow. I call a demon, he attends my call; The peasant's wholesome cup he fills with gall. I bid a monster that fair town destroy; 'Tis doneâI view him smile with hellish joy. I bid a mother quick dispatch her child; 'Tis o'erâthat cry, how innocent! how wild! I bid a son his parent smite to death; I see the parent, gasping, close his breath. I bid the murd'rer plunge his steel in gore; He shews it reekingâwhat can wretch do more? 'Twas I bade Williams try the murd'rous art; He grinn'd horrific; well perform'd his part! In carnage now, I glory to my shame; Now to relieve the helpless is my aim: I succour many a brother in distress, And fabrics rear to make their sorrows less: The beggars bless me, curse me, this I own; Yet pomp and pow'r I humble with a frown. Millions by me themselves at once undo; Millions for want of me are ruin'd too. I level states and empires when I chuse; And kings my mandates seldom dare refuse: I lord it o'er the world, with tyrant sway; Bid cities flourish, others sweep away. For me, yon patriot loud of freedom raves; I nod, his happy country he enslaves. For me, the artist rears yon lofty dome; For me the starveling whistles at his loom. Bards strike the tuneful lyre, and I'm the theme; Crown'd heads and low-born wretches of me drear My country's threaten'd; I avert the blow, And the dull rabble ever keep in awe: From shore to shore I fly, borne on each gale; To greet me with a smile, none ever fail. I speak all languages, although I'm dumb; And pity 'tis, I'm seldom overcome. I'm dark; I'm fair; I'm light; I'm heavy found; And am an hundred fathoms under ground. Since time's beginning, all have own'd my skill: Till time shall end, I must be ruler still! Again transpose me; in a heavy gale, Tars I make tremble, cowards I turn pale, Again transpose me, and I'll quick disclose, What to my aid each land of commerce owes: What sail'd with Drake, with Anson, this globe round, And Cook's companion, too, was daily found. Transpose again, and by one half you'll see, What's worn on princes, prelates, you, not me. Presto! again; now certes beyond doubt, You know what farmers seldom are without. Be patient, reader. Try me, oft I'll change; Become a beast that doth the forests range: Another, many a thrifty housewife's dread; Another still, that by the last is fed. Lastly; I bear the hero from the field:â Tell what I am, or quick thy judgment yield. Carnmoney, near Belfast. ENIGMA THE SECOND. In yon fair town, Belfast. where Lagan's lazy stream Steals softly past, and men of commerce dream; Where wealth, where fashion, hold the gay levee, Or dry the tear of each wan wretch they see; Where merit ever finds a sure reward, And each has the good wishes of our bard; Where Drummond, Rev. Dr. Drummond, translator of Lucretius, author of âThe Giant's Causeway,â and other works. The merits of this gentleman have been justly appreciated by his countrymen, and others; eulogium, however warrantable, might therefore be deemed superfluous. learn'd, with all a poet's art, In verse majestic, sways at will the heart; Where Balfour From the fire of genius, and the harmonius versification this lady has displayed, her name may rank with the first poetic favourites of her country. In her elegant Poem addressed to Hope, many passages will bear a comparison with Mr. Thomas Campbell's, on the same subject, without injuring the fair fame of our Authoress.âHer Songs, sprightly, or pathetic, are always interesting, and particularly calculated for the amusement of her countrymen. As a dramatist, she requires only the patronage of the great, to establish her fame; and make life a scene of pleasure, which has for some years been the reverse. strikes her lyre, the silver sound, Terne hears, and spreads her fame around; Where Bunting, Mr. Edward Bunting, organist of Belfast; who by his late musical publication, industriously and judiciously saved many of the most interesting Irish melodies from the stream of oblivion. eager for his country's praise, Snatches from time the songs of other days, The harp new strings, that long aside was thrownâ Throughout the Em'rald Isle, long be it known; Where sons of genius, bow'd by want or care, Too little known, sing âto the desert air;â There am I found.âYes, I'm at each one's call, And some to me attribute their downfall; Strange falsehoods, these; for I would none offend, But to the multitude would be a friend. I'm known to kings, and am to kings unknown; Tho' round them daily is my influence shewn. I'm oft-times found in France's gay domain, With sans culottes; and eke with haughty Spain; With slovenly Mynheer, I too am seen; And am the fav'rite of each Mandarine. In Scotland more than Ireland am I priz'd; In many parts of England much despis'd. Behold yon captive in his dark dank cell, With such as he I'm ne'er asham'd to dwell. The insolvent debtor, from all friends exil'd, With hazard look, where health once blooming smil'd, The thoughts of happy years, long since flown by, Break night's repose, and force the daily sigh; Yet, 'mid the solemn stilness of the night, Aided by me, ev'n he tastes pure delight; With my assistance, he his foes may dare, Hope's rays on him I dartânow cause despair. I'm from afar, and little known afarâ I'm priz'd by seamen, scorn'd by many a tar: The dauntless sailor on the giddy mast, Draws comfort from me, 'mid the roughest blast; He toils submissive, scorning to complain, Laughs, jokes, and sings, then thinks of me again. The shiv'ring centinel, I too can cheer; Or down his manly cheek force many a tear. The peasant, happy in his straw-roof'd cot, Beholds meâin a trice beholds me not; And oft a-field with him, caress'd I'm seen, But ere next morn he knows not what I mean. I'm seen with Bess the beggar, in the street; Princes, alas! don't know me, when we meet. Many they are, who know me but by name; Many they are, I daily put to shame: Some great men know me not, some weak ones do; Some mortals I enrich, some ruin too. The lawyer, doctor, parson, I befriend, And at the grave, some heroes I attend. Now for my colourâstill am I at ease, I'm white, red, black, blue, green, whate'er you please; And as for form, I'm lusty now, now spare, Now perpendicular, now round, now square; Diagonal, and horizontal too; Believe our author, faith he tells you true: Now long, now short, and now so very small, Saddle your nose, I'm scarcely seen at all. I, Proteus like, change fifty times a-day, But I'll be cautious, nor myself betray. And now, dissect me, reader, if you please; In schools I'm flogg'd, in schools I sit at ease. I'm now a birdâam now by soldiers wornâ Next by all ages, by both sexes borneâ Our blooming sisters, pride of Britain's court, To where the Loves and Graces still resort, Have worn me oft; I'm ever at their call; God grant them virtuous husbands, one and all!â You hear me, and an useful creature seeâ Now I'm the virtuous man, the villain's pleaâ The carrier uses me, ay, day by dayâ The tradesman too, whatever sum you payâ You try me, every dainty I refuse, Now greedily devour whate'er you chuse: You see you coxcombs flutt'ring in the street; They'll use me, ten to one, if chance they meet. I animals can please, both great and smallâ In every country, mankind on me call. Now I'm what many thousands fain wou'd knowâ I make yon Corsican our country's foe; And shou'd the tyrant, and his sanguine host, But rashly dare to venture on our coast, They'll find an hundred Nelsons in command, And Moores, and Wellingtons, throughout the land!â On me, tho' many millions love to tread; Grateful am I, and yield them daily breadâ An useful piece of furniture you see; It serves our author, reader it serves theeâ Now I'm a liquid, topers think a treat; I'm strong, I'm weak, I'm bitter, sour, and sweetâ I'm like a noisy instrument oft heardâ And now to every pleasure I'm preferr'd; You use me, nor without me can you live; I make you sick, and well, new vigour give To lisping infancy and hoary age: Shame on me war 'gainst poverty to wage!â I many a tear provoke, cause oft a smile; And seen in Albion's, more than Erin's Isleâ Now I adorn a city, cottage feastâ Now I become a bold, a cunning beastâ I form a part of many a female dress, Worn by our good queen Charlotte, bluff queen Bess; And Egypt's amorous queen bore me about, When romping with Mark Anthony, no doubtâ I'm seen on flow'rs, each garden's gayest prideâ I'm what you eat, with fowls plac'd side by sideâ Next I'm a bird, some taste, some never taste; Near gormandizing aldermen oft plac'dâ Now I'm a name in Scripture oft thou'st read, If e'er that best of books ran in thy headâ A name thou'lt find me in great Shakspeare's page, He who pourtray'd the manners of each age; Who robb'd dame Nature, oft, with matchless skill, And leads the mind a captive at his will: Unlike the boasted Philos of our age, Who flatter folly, for a rabble's praiseâ Now I'm an idolâNow a patriot foundâ Now please the sportsman, and the crowd aroundâ I'm us'd in sickness, and I'm us'd in health; And I'm a place of fashion, fame, and wealthâ Yon simp'ring quack, precise, with wig and cane, Makes use of me, alas! too oft in vainâ Mark well what changes I can make appear; Without me, reader, long thoud'st not been hereâ Oft I refresh youâNow o'er me you rideâ I'm us'd by buildersâI'm the drunkard's prideâ I'm like a hero, when he gasps in deathâ I please the sportsman, when he pants for breathâ You hear me loudly call'd at each reviewâ You hear me bawl'd out on each race-course, tooâ Now I'm a place, where men, where women meet, Lies propagate, enjoy a social treat; Near me, this hour, Care hides his hideous head, But ere the next, all harmony is fledâ An artist's tool am I, whom all admireâ Now I enliven millions round the fireâ Now many a son of Erin I offend, Now I'm their summerânow their winter friendâ Now Gripus views me oft, with greedy joyâ Now many a town and hamlet I destroyâ Of tot'ring age, you find me next the boastâ By me, alas! some hundreds have been lostâ I'm now a vowelâNow are we a pair; Glance o'er the Chronicle, you'll find us thereâ Oft I delight you, make you stand aghastâ Lastly, I'm like some houses in Belfast. Reader, an author little known to fame, But one whose labours may some notice claim, (Proud if his song, or enigmatic lay Can soothe a sorrowing brother on his way) Again has dar'd to trespass on thy time, And pardon craves; he lives not by his rhyme; But wou'd amuse some friends, when labour's o'erâ This cost him three hours study, and not more. Carnmoney, Feb. 25, 1812. ENIGMA THE THIRD. Reader, not in pompous verse I sing, Nor with the Sons of Genius hope to vie; Ne'er have I drank at the Castalian spring, Yet oft to please a rustic groupe I try: For this, my Muse beguiles the hours of leisureâ O may my light effusion yield thee pleasure! In ev'ry state, throughout the globe, I'm found, Where'er the steps of man imprint the ground; Now seen with monarchs, side by side; Now with the beggar, and his bride; Oft I'm thought a welcome guest; Oft with thorns I wound the breast, And feel for no man; To crush the noble mind, Thro' all ranks of mankind, Alas! is but too common! From Ganges banks to Mississippi's shore, Or where the icy streams of TornÃ¨ roar, To man I've been a friend; Proud to assist the high, the low, I'm virtue's pride, am vice's foe, And thus may I remain till time shall have an end. The wretch bow'd down by care and toil, Feels death approaching with a smile, A ray of comfort oft derives from me; Now numbers boldly me abuse, And well they may, with fair excuse, For thousands I've destroyed, by land and sea. I'm nam'd in many a poet's page; Dramatists force me on the stage; Old Chaucer, Shak speare, Dryden, Cowper, Burns, Have sung of me by turns; And Scott, the adventurous chief of song, Whose lays of chivalry, sweet and strong, A captive bind the heart, When of former days, He the manners pourtrays, Names me with a poet's art. Historians, politicians, 'gainst me rage, In scribbling fury; I've been oppress'd by many a great law sage, And eke the brainless jury. Many there are who little think about me, And if my deeds are nam'd they shrug and doubt me. Reader, dost thou visit church, Or leave the parson in the lurch? Thou'rt fond, perchance, of play or ball; Whether thou think'st retirement sweet, Or lov'st to lounge the street, I'm ever at thy call. To no one colour can I be confin'd; Eyes I have, but oft am blind; As to size, I'm long, I'm short, A giant, now a pigmy's sport; Immoveable, now move at ease, Oppress, delight, and many teaze: Like some great men at court, too much I say About myself; agreed: and now, I pray, Dissect me, gentle reader, if you please. You'll find a beast; a bird; a tree; What's seen in Heaven, but not by you or me; What cheers the seaman far at sea; The sportsman's dear delight: Part of the head; a wholesome liquor, Priz'd by prelate and by vicar; And what procures the beggar many a mite. A part of the female dress, Worn long ere the days of queen Bess; A British bard oft nam'd; A senator justly fam'd; An Indian fruit; An useful brute; A prison, where the wildest oft are tam'd. What caused in Scotia many a broil, And oft disturb'd the Em'rald Isle; A female name; What calls forth shame; What robs the beauteous face of many a smile. What thousands dread; What thousands tread; What thousands yearly seek: What thousands ruin daily; What thousands mount on gaily; What spreads a blush on many a lovely cheek. What hurls destruction o'er the land and main, And gives to millions pleasure, millions painâ Leaving a houseless wretch the peaceful swain. What's oft the poor man's food; What gamesters love to hold; What's giv'n for each man's good; What's dearer far than gold: What yields to multitudes delight; What many a good man's ruin proves; What's hateful to the villain's sight; What woman dearly loves. A town in France, which gave a tyrant birth; A part much gaz'd at in the female shape: An useful earth; A well-known cape. An English bishop's see; What many cannot do; What each one ought to be; What's touch'd but by a few. A Greek philosopher; Scottish duke; A word much us'd in the sacred book; A marshal of France, well known; A dismal shout; What few are without; A botanist fam'd the world throughout; A sportsman, best pleas'd, when alone. A fish; what's mostly found in a street; That which affords a nourishing sweet; A river, the poet's theme; A fruit that yields a delicious treat; What oft'times contains an animal's meat; A manure some useful deem. What travels with speed; What serves you in need With liquors, the best and the worst; What bears you on high; What time's measur'd by; A title of old Giv'n by fame, we are told, To heroes, but now to base sycophants sold, Whose names are by nations accurs'd. Enough, good-natur'd Muse, thy rambling cease, Still at my cabin thou'rt a welcome guest: Long may we virtuous pleasures try t'increase, For man's a riddle, and this life's a jest! Carnmoney, near Belfast. ENIGMA THE FOURTH. Reader, a vagrant Muse, mid' these bleak hills, With dreams poetic, oft our Author fills; Bids him again the advent'rous task engage, To please, surprise, in this enlighten'd age: Bold this, indeed! Methinks you soft exclaim; Hush, friend! to please is still our Author's aim: Weak is his lyre, yet tun'd in virtue's praise, To goodness, not to wealth, he homage pays. Th' exordium, egotistic, pray excuse, He courts not flattery, but for candour sues; Proud if thou smil'st on his unpolish'd line, Rhyme is his hobby.âReader, what is thine? I benefit mankind, am useless found; Now irritate, delight whole nations round; Am seen mid' splendid domes, in lowliest cot; Now thought worth thousands, now not worth a groat: Now on the waters, now in air am seen; Now many a fathom in the earth have been: Great Newton I delighted, all allow, He saw me for the benefit of you; And Swift, eccentric genius, Erin's pride, With him oft have I wander'd side by side. My size oft varies, I'm both great and small; Now seen by numbers, now not seen at all: Now I occasion many a heart-felt joy; Now hopes and pleasures quickly I destroy: Whole provinces with me have nought to do: The great man prizes me, the base one too. I'm seen in dungeons, not in every jail; My loss the world oft did, oft will bewail. I'm brought after by ev'ry fav'ring breeze, Yet Britain's sons can make me at their ease; Her daughters, too, caress me, with a smile, Long be they happy as they're void of guile! For ne'er did Nature, since she tried her art, Form beings more to captivate the heart; And while mirth, goodness, claim his deep regard, Still they'll enjoy the praises of our bard. Near rivers now I'm seen, with anxious stare; Go wander Eden's banks, you'll find me there. Now Reader, some strange things I'll bring to view, Dissect me carefully, you'll own 'tis true. I'm dark, I'm pale, I'm feeble, and I'm strong; I'm light, I'm heavy, short am I, and long; For me you call, I'm with you day by day; Aid young and old, wise, foolish, grave, and gay. I'm fruit; I'm fish; I'm insect, bird, and beast; Next I delight the glutton at a feast: A poet, patriot, gen'ral, king I turn, And now o'er me, in tears, the afflicted mourn. You worship me, and now of me complain; Then think of me, and ask what news from Spain. Yon connoiseur now views me o'er and o'er, Stares, rubs his eye-glass, squints at me once more: Swears I'm invaluable: what does he mean? I own I please the beggar and the queen. Yon artless ploughman, whistling o'er the lea, Hears me, delighted; Reader, I've pleas'd thee. Now I'm a highwayman, great London's dread; And now from me are thousands daily fed. I'm on yon mountain, in that woody glen; Mankind I daily serve; alas! what then, They disregard me, use me night and day; Praise, and abuse me; what's the reason, pray? You see me, and you quick let fall a tear; You hear from me, aye, daily through the year: O'er me you laugh and joke, carouse and sing. I'm beggar's bev'rage, and can please a king. Now I'm the rustic's pride, the miser's dream; Now I'm a river, many a poet's theme; The drunkard's joy; the studious artist's toast; The robber's dread; and many a farmer's boast. Now children wear me; now by age I'm worn; By me, with great delight, the Cockney's borne: Yon gamester I enrich, and him undo; Yon party I enliven, vex them too. You see me in the ball-room, in the street You hear me, and oft fly me when we meet. I from the main save many a gallant tar; I'm made for soldiers, us'd in peace and war: I hide each beauteous object from your view, You pray for me, and many I undo: I give you plenty, and each hope destroy; Know, friends, from me each blessing you enjoy: I claim the pity of each passer by, Call forth the manly tear, the heart-felt sigh. Man's notice I have sought in every age, The young, the old, the ideot, and the sage; They gaze on me, each season, with delight, I in a moment vanish from their sight. Mark well you busy crew with ceaseless mirth, For me, they mole-like daily toil in earth; A thousand various forms I quick assume, And now your garrets, painted halls illume. I, tyrant like, cause streams of blood to flow; I'm used by beauty, yet am beauty's foe: For various purposes am still employ'd, Have states delighted, and have men destroy'd. By me aloft, methinks I see you borne; Sad change, alas! I make you each one's scorn: I turn you frightful in your country's eyes, But ne'er destroy your hope beyond the skies. By me all ages, nations have been charm'd, And anger of his rage is quick disarm'd; Th' untutor'd Indian, nature's simplest child, My pow'r confesses oft, in raptures wild. I'm now an herb, still grateful to your nose; A reptile, and in man disgust oft cause; I'm provinces; I'm rivers; many a town; And now on me with horror you look down. Now I'm an article of useful food; Now do, what ev'ry mortal should do, good; Snatch pale-fac'd suff'rers from the yawning grave: Much evil, too, for millions I enslave. I'm like a sland'rous vixen, o'er her tea, She deals out scandal, gazing oft on me; I'm next a card, she's eager to behold; Now I adorn her head, or young, or old. The British tar sees me with greedy joy: Mankind I now defend, mankind destroy. I'm parent own'd of universal good, Form'd by th' all-wise Creator, ere the flood; My influence is own'd in every clime, And must continue till the end of time. Observe yon motley groupe of young and old, Toys, health, wealth, freedom, bartering for gold; Our nation's glory, and her foul disgrace, Where men like brutes are purchas'd, I'm that place. You work, exquisite from the artist's hand, That Genius o'er the midnight taper plann'd, Where beauty, grace, taste, science are combin'd, I'll quick destroy, nor leave a wreck behind.â In fam'd St. Stephens, alias Wrangler's Hall, Where men for office and for freedom bawl, Where patriotic weathercocks hold forth, And unfledg'd statesmen scowl on modest worth; There oft I'm seen with traitors, cheek by jole; And ev'n in council, great men I controul. Behold you wretched hovel on the moor, You'll see me, if you enter but the door; Look in the palace, and you'll find me there; I'm in the play-house, market, crowd, and fair. I'm with the Regent oft, am oft his pride, Woe to all those who would his steps misguide! Thro' him, may suff'ring mortals hope for peace; Thro' him, may all religious discord cease! I'm black, I'm white, I long, I short am found; Soaring in air; now groveling on the ground: I'm silent, noisy, eloquent, and dumb, Of size gigantic, and but like Tom Thumb: Now many a fathom deep, in ocean lie; Now out of sight, above the clouds I fly.â Yon toil-worn exile, prey to want and grief, To whom Hope soothing gives a faint relief, Views me; and Fancy paints in colours true, Scenes youth pourtray'd, when sorrows were but few: Loves, friendships cherish'd, tear his tortur'd breast; He weeps, and looks to Heav'n alone for rest.â Observe yon sinner, on the bed of death; Mark the deep groan, the short-drawn closing breath; Hope tells another hour may ease his pain, But ne'er let Hope deceive the giddy brain: Him, how I torture! Conscience acts her part, Soon life's red current ceases round his heart. Next, view the man of worth, at life's sad close, The look serene the Christian's hope he shews; Him I afflict in vain. He patient bears Aches, sickness, poverty; nor e'er despairs: Firm, convinc'd life's race is nearly run, He gratefully exclaims, God's will be done! The Ruler of the Winds, thus, if he please, A healing gives to sorrow or disease. Full three hours' study hath this trifte cost; Now patient Reader, should thy time seem lost, Henceforth my Muse will other themes pursueâ Enigmatists, I bid you all adieu. Carnmoney, near Belfast. EPISTLES. EPISTLE THE FIRST. TO ONE WHO PREFERRED THE JOYS OF LONDON, TO THE RURAL PLEASURES OF THE COUNTRY. And will my friend then run life's race, Where virtue oft to vice gives place; For quiet wishing every hour; Cloy'd with the noise he must endure; For ever toiling in the crowd, Expos'd to insults meanly rude, Forc'd to be rakish, vain, and proud. Now busier than the veriest slave; Now bowing to some artful knave; Now gadding thro' the restless town, For fashion seeking up and down; Or idly trifling time away, At noisy tavern, park, or play. Methinks I see you panting sit, In Colman's elbow-pinching pit; Or with their godships, (dismal groupe) Yclep'd hoarse Bully Uproar's troop, A slave to pleasure, pain, and fear, Laugh at the wit you cannot hear, Or weep, 'cause others drop a tear. Or if to loud debate you fly, Where dunce gives dunce the dull reply; Where reason's rul'd by impudence, And wit to virtue gives offence; You hear each ignoramus prate, 'Bout Whig and Tory, church and state; But with as much success might draw Instruction from a pert jackdaw. This hubbub over; next you view Disease, and all her ghastly crew; Here danger lurks in every street, Here injur'd innocence you meet; Here the remains of beauty trace, In some poor midnight wand'rer's face; For, well, my friend, I know your breast Of each fine feeling is possest: But may you, ever with disgust, Avoid the foul embrace of lust; Whether the luring wanton smiles At proud St. James's or St. Giles'! Thro' scenes of riot thus you reel, To pent-up garret forc'd to steal; Where, wak'd by watchmen's toneless chime, Discordant nightingales of time, You taste not ease; for calm repose Is what the city seldom knows: Thus youth you spend in real pain, For misery in age to gain! If e'er you steal an hour from care, And leave the town for purer air, Think sometimes of an absent friend; And fancy thus the hours I spend. When evening bids my labour cease, In nook retir'd I muse in peace, On these remember'd, those belov'd, Or books peruse, by you approv'd; Or with a friend, (tho' few I own, For friendship is but little known) In summer o'er the meadows rove, Or trace the wood, and beechen grove, Where Eden's winding current strays, And thro' the fruitful valley plays; Or range, elate, the plenteous fields, When earth to man her produce yields. What tho' no syren's voice we hear, Still sweeter minstrels charm the ear; While straining Mara you encore, The feather'd choir delight me more. No costly painted domes we view; No glitt'ring palaces, 'tis true: Yet num'rous landscapes meet the eye, That domes and palaces outvie. In peace, reclining at our ease, We taste the health-bestowing breeze, Beneath some osier's cooling shade; Or mark the changes time hath made, Since youth his fairy gambols play'd. We laugh at love, and all his tricks, And scorn with fashion's fools to mix; Nor envy nor the rich, nor great, Nor heed who rules o'er church or state. Tho' different thoughts lead you and me, Yet friendship bids our hearts agree; Of pleasures, rural, or the town, No more, my Willy; both must own, That happiness is but a name, By prince, by peasant known the same But when self-interest sways the mind, Man seeks in vain that gem to find. Did riches ease the aching heart, Or sorrow's tear forbid to start; lOr add to th' number of our days, Then might the miser claim our praise: But they give seldom health or peace, And oft, too oft, our cares increase. Regardless, then, of fortune's smile, Be ours, my friend, content and toil; And blest with friendship, peace, and health, E'en let who will contend for wealth! Carlisle, September, 1798. EPISTLE THE SECOND. TO MISS E. C?E, IN SCOTLAND. Ye Pow'rs abuin, O hear me now! If I'm to cla' an auld man's pow, Just grant a circle o' leel friends, To cheer me, ere life's journey ends! Sin' first I wrote R. A. his book, God gie him grace on it to look! I've fash'd my friens wi' monie a line; In tuneless rhyme, in senseless prose; Now teazin' these, now pleasin' those, As folly, whim, or friendship chose To rule this head o' mine. Tho' weel acquaint wi' monie a ane, Of a' the lave, how few I ken, Wha can for sense wi' ye compare! Woo lass! had I auld Ramsay's skill, Or like Ayr's Bardie, wit at will, 'Twou'd pleasure gie, to drive the quill, That ye my verse might share! But he wha cheerfu' does his best, Guid-natur'd sauls forgie the rest; Sae nought hae I frae ye to fear. Driv'n by wild Autumn frae ilk bow'r, Where linties late did wild notes pour, In cot retir'd, I'll ryhme an hour, To please a frien sae dear. Now far frae town the sportsman flies, Proud to ensnare the harmless prize; Be his, sic pleasures to enjoy! To range o'er mountain, muir, and heath, Charm'd wi' ilk sound that echoes death; My aim shall be, while I draw breath, To save but ne'er destroy! The hollow blasts begin to bla', And frae the trees, leaves twitt'rin' fa'; A lesson seemin' aft to gie: For ere anither Autumn come, They'll rustle o'er the narrow tomb O' monie, wha now boast health's bloom, And may be, thee, or me! Life's simmer, Bess, is thine and mine, But hastnin' quick to a decline; That 'tis sae, haith, I find fu' weel! Time's snatch'd the forelock frae my pate, And hope that made this heart elate, Now lea's me mourning o'er my fate, A luckless, rhymin' chiel. What then, like me, baith rich and puir, Maun painfu' trials here endure; Yet man, weak man's his greatest foe: A something ay appears in view, The fleetin' shadow we pursue; And if o'erta'en, this aft is true, It adds but to our woe. Wou'd we enjoy the envied state, Whilk mortals truly may ca' great, On pleasure we shou'd ne'er be bent; Reason shou'd o'er ilk thought preside, And honesty ay act as guide; Syne let what will on earth betide, We ay may rest content. Niest to give life a double charm, And slander o' her rage disarm, Friendship shou'd temper weel the whole: But true it is, we seldom find That social tie amang mankind; Int'rest o'er aft enslaves the mind That ought to think for all. To this gie riches, that a name; To ane gie pow'r, anither fame; And let ambition's sons ay rule: Gie me a sonsy honest friend, On whom I may wi' truth depend, And cheerfu' I'll to puirtith bend, Nor envy fortune's fool! But in life's journey, gin we meet A leel true saul, whase converse sweet Can soothe a while the throbbing heart; That jillet, fortune, steps atween, And changes quick the happy scene; Syne a' we boast is what has been, Ay laith sae suin to part. Just sae it far'd wi' us, I trow, Ere hawf acquaint, awa' thou flew; Tho' distant, Bess, I swear to thee, While genius, worth, I can discern, Or aught o' virtue wish to learn, Howe'er by fate I'm thrawn astern, Remember'd thou wilt be! Carlisle. EPISTLE THE THIRD. TO MR. ROBERT CARLYLE. O thou, my long-lov'd, and much-honour'd friend, Why on the winding banks of Tay, Doth sorrow ay point out thy way, And melancholy still thy steps attend? When virtue fires the youthful breast, Her vot'ry, pure, should live secure; And be, where'er he strays, a welcome guest. Now smiles the season gay, which erst thine eye Beheld, while by thy native streams, Ting'd oft by Sol's departing beams, The sober landscape made thy heart beat high: Shall Spring, with all her joyous train, Her sweets diffuse, of various hues, And thou, in pensive numbers mark her reign? Ah! no.âSince science hath illum'd thy mind, And genius pour'd to thee her store, Let sadness twine the wreath no more, Of faded flow'rs, thy youthful brows to bind! If reason bids us joy despise, And guiltless mirth gives sorrow birth, All may exclaim, â'Tis folly to be wise!â Self-exil'd mid' majestic scenes to roam, Where Tay's proud streams incessant roar, Or Lomond laves the wood-fring'd shore; With grief, I saw thee quit thy happy home, Where scowling pride thy merit view'd, And mark'd a youth in quest of truth, But mock'd his sufferings with ingratitude. Alas! that genius e'er should know distress! Or bend, in spite of reason's rules, An abject slave to fortune's fools; While bloated ignorance mankind caress! Yet, heed not thou the world's sharp frown, Content, and health, to haughty wealth, And humble poverty, alike are known. Bethink thee of the cares that all await; Nor let dejection cloud thy brow, If to the world thou'rt doom'd to bow; Nor view with partial eye the pomp of state: To nature's child, a virtuous name Can give repose, and heal his woes, More than doth e'er the air-blown bubble fame. Why labours o'er his midnight lamp, the sage, Still teaching man himself to know? 'Tis his, to trace the source of woe, And ours, to glean instruction from his page; To make the most of life's short span, And seek of Heav'n, the promise giv'n; These are the noblest studies of frail man. Then court not, ere thy prime, the sombrous shade, Where dwell disease, and cank'ring care; Nor let the haggard fiend despair Thy steps mislead; if by the world betray'd. But, ah! if hope no more can cheer Thy bosom, torn, in life's fair morn, Long, long for thee shall Friendship shed the silent tear! Carlisle, April 27, 1800. EPISTLE THE FOURTH. TO MARIA OF THE COTTAGE, The late Mrs. Munster of Belfast. She has long been known as an authoress, and chose that appellation in Magazines, Newspapers, &amp;c. She commenced her literary career in early youth, by publishing the âCottage of the Appenines,â a Romance, in 4 vols. This work, which was completed in her sixteenth year, proves her to be a warm admirer of the celebrated Mrs. Radcliffe. In âRosa,â a Tale, she has displayed a knowledge of the world in a story replete with interesting incident. Her language and pathos cannot fail to please the lovers of Sterne, or the author of the âMan of Feeling.â Although she may truly assert with Camoens, âMy cradle was the couch of care,And sorrow rock'd me in it,â yet no one ever bore the crosses of life with greater fortitude, nor did cheerfulness forsake her when the tomb seemed yawning for her reception. Sensibility, vivacity, and a philanthropic spirit, could not fail to make Maria the admiration of many a learned and respectable circle. She died in January 1818, and was interred in the new burial ground, Belfast. ON HER BIRTH-DAY. âLong may she live, The care of Heav'n; and her declining years Be crown'd with plenty, and with happiness!â This is thy natal day. Now thrice seven times Hath Spring, still welcome, scatter'd o'er the earth Her fost'ring dews, then with her joyous train A flow'r-wov'n carpet spread o'er many a mead, While caroll'd each wild warbler; thrice seven times Hath savage Winter ravish'd Autumn's charms, Since first thou saw the light. Fair innccent! From that blest hour which gave thee to this world, This world of vanity, this world of care, Where wealth is honour'd, worth oft doom'd to pine, Ne'er hath bright Sol shone on a sweeter flow'r; A winter rose, not âborn to blush unseen.â May'st thou, when many years have o'er thee roll'd, And time, relentless tyrant, beauty's foe, Hath furrow'd that fair face, with smiles behold, In blest retirement, tranquilliz'd thy mind, Sol's cheering beams, then think of well-spent years; Prepar'd to seek the Christian's sure reward, As sinking to thy last sad narrow bed! This thy friend wisheth. Friend unknown to fame; Who spite of jaundic'd slander, bloated wealth, Who spite of the fool's scorn, will ever give To modest worth, to genius pure, its due. Health, rosy health, presided at thy birth, And watch'd thy infant slumbers. Plump-cheek'd mirth Enraptur'd, gaz'd, then mark'd thee for her own. Next, mild religion with parental care, Rear'd the young shoot, with finger held to Heav'n. Genius, who scorns the multitude, whose smile No diadem can purchase, heav'nly maid; Who with a spark divine the mind illumes, And makes each fav'rite soothe a brother's woes, Nurs'd thee, her darling. Hope, with uplift hands, The cherub bless'd; then promis'd happy days. But hope's a fair deceiver. Gaily drest, She whispers man of countless joys in store; And by her smiles, alas! he's oft undone! Grave wisdom, with instruction by her side, Oft pleas'd to hear thy lisping accents sweet, Wou'd point to many a flow'ry path, which leads To fame's far distant temple. High it stands; And thousands try in vain to climb the mount, Access still eager hoping. Careful, she The thorns secreted from thy ardent gaze, And lur'd thy feet the steps they oft have trod. Ne'er was thy cradle the sad couch of care, Nor did pale sorrow ever rock thee in it. Life's morn was fair as fleeting: all a dream; A fev'rish dream, time ne'er must realize! How little thought the rose-cheek'd beauteous groupe, When dear associates in each fairy scene, Rev'lers in bliss uncloy'd, a few short years Wou'd find thee musing o'er the midnight lamp; A young but great instructress. Chilling, now, With horror wild, the youthful reader's frame; As in idea, o'er thy glowing works, He fondly bends, and shudders at each sound, Some spectre dreading. Next the gothic stairs, Scar'd, slow ascending, he at length beholds In chamber gloomy, some sad captive, pale, Woe-worn, and ghastly. Some angelic maid, Stol'n from her home, a virtuous sacrifice To lordly man, foul image of his Maker. The scene now changes; nature's children please; And love's delights, Arcadian sweets surprise. The reader mingles with some village groupe, And joins the evening dance; and revelry; Or with them roams, aided by Luna's beam, Pale empress of the night. Perchance he sees Some tow'r half-hid, and half-embrown'd by shade; While on his ear the bird of sorrow flings Her sad, but soothing song. Long may'st thou lead, Daughter of magic, with thy high-wrought scenes (Where pure morality adorns thy page, And virtue shines a mirror to each sex, While guilt's dark deeds provoke Heav'n's bitter wrath) The mind a willing captive. May reward Still crown thy labors, friend to all mankind! Nor e'er the Muse desert thee! Yes! ev'n now, Methinks thy name 'midst Erin's gifted fair Will live recorded, on the lists of fame. Ah! little dreamt thou, child of innocence, In infancy, life's golden happy age, A few short years wou'd find thee sorrow's child; And sickness spread for thee a painful couch! Guileless thy heart. How little didst thou know Ev'n with a mind well stor'd, th' unfeeling world! But let me o'er thy wrongs throw friendship's veil, Nor irritate a sore, not yet half heal'd. The feeling heart my pen shall never wound; No man is he, who sports with virtue's tears! Now when December with his thousand storms, Ah! dreaded month, to many a houseless wretch! In frozen snow-clad mantle sweeps the vale, Wither'd and leafless, ruin scattering round, Peaee to thy cot! May health, coy, rosy fair, And blithe content long thy companions be; While changing seasons yield thee greater bliss! Unenvying, thou canst view yon bustling town, Belfast Where high ambition rears a haughty head; And all is commerce, craft, and cank'ring care. This wild unpolish'd lay should'st thou approve, I'll smiling, scorn the learn'd reader's sneer. December 26, 1808. EPISTLE THE FIFTH. TO ROBERT ANDERSON. While on the Lyne's romantic stream, Meek ev'ning threw her farewell beam, In mem'ry's soft reflected hue Those rapt'rous hours return'd to view, When you, in vales that blush'd with flow'rs, Entranc'd the ear with music's pow'rs: But, since you bade these vales farewell, No bard awakes the vocal shell; No flute e'er breathes the woods among, Symphonious to the milk-maid's song: Our merry-nights, where pleasure ties Her garlands of a hundred dies, Where love glows with his purest flame, Leave no memorials of their fame; Our meddings, where the dance and bowl Bathe, in the fount of bliss, the soul, Pass like the dreams of night away, The subject of no minstrel's lay: And the fair maids of Eden's plain Implore a poet's aid in vain, To paint their roses ere they die, And the blue languish of their eye. Come, then, my friend, and bring with thee That welcome heartâthe heart of glee; Thy flute will cheer my bow'rs once more, And all my long-lost joys restore; Bright will my ev'ning star go down, Though Fortune and my Juliet frown; 'Mid social hours of radiant hue, To pallid care I'll bid adieu; O'er Gibson's A respectable Innkeeper in Carlisle. ale, the festive night Shall fly on pinions soft and light; The tale and song's enchanting pow'r Shall long protract the parting hour; And, till on Eden's chrystal stream The morning's purple splendour beam, The glass, in streamy pride, shall roll A tide of transport o'er the soul. Oh! tell me, soon, in prose or rhyme, What fills the void of vacant time: Are still th' inspiring Muses kind? Do their green wreathes thy temples bind? On Erin's shore, oh! do they meet Their poet with their visions sweet? And do the loves and young desires Still flutter o'er thy joyous wires? Still does the enchantress beauty dart Her charms upon thy captiv'd heart? Or does the harp of sorrow mourn O'er love or friendship's timeless urn? Perhaps, in fancy's magic glass, Thy native vales before thee pass; Those scenes of sweet delight appear That to the eye of youth were dear: Perhaps the nymphs of Eden's stream My smile in some poetic dream; May come in each attractive form, With beauty, love, or virtue warm! 'Twas thus the sweetest bard of Rome, Ovid,âwho was banished from Rome to Tomos, which is supposed by some to be the modern Temisware in Hungary: placed by Wells in the 44th degree of north latitude. When banished from his friends and home, Upon the ling'ring moment threw Reflected joys of every hue; More precious far than CÃ¦sar's throne An imag'd world he made his own! In fancy's visionary light The Tyber darted on his sight; And every scene o'er which he hung With exstacy, when life was young, Return'd to soothe an exile's hours, And gleam upon his shadowy bow'rs. Then, oh! then, no longer frown'd The wildness of the desart round; The howling of the tempest's blast, Unheard, amidst the grey rocks, past; And, on the bosom of the deep, The angry surges seem'd to sleep. Oh! could, dear friend, a verse of mine The treasures of the soul enshrine, The richness of thy worth should glow, When o'er my grave the wild winds blow; And green should distant ages find The wreath that sacred friendship twin'd: But, ah! my rude, unpolished lay Is but the record of a day; Soon, soon, dear friend, my rustic rhyme Shall feel the deadly touch of time; Oblivion's ruthless hand shall shed Her night-shades o'er thy Crito's head; And not a line of living fame Shall bear to future times his name! CRITO. EPISTLE THE SIXTH. TO CRITO. This ingenious and virtuous man, Mr. Thomas Sanderson, whose works, in prose or poetry, have justly gained him the admiration and esteem of his enlightened countrymen, is a native of Sebergham, and resides in the Parish of Kirklinton, Cumberland. To him the public are indebted, for his well-written and interesting notes on the âCumberland Ballads.â His friendship will always be gratefully remembered by the Author of this publication; whose wish it is, that health, peace, plenty, and the Muse, may long be his welcome companions. âFriendship, mysterious cement of the soul, Sweet'ner of life, and solder of society, I owe thee much!â My harp I neglected, and careless threw by; Its tones became feeble, beguil'd not the night; And oft as I view'd it, I said, with a sigh, âSweet soother of woe, thou'lt no longer delight! The wild-flow'rs of fancy now charm me no more, The pictures of hope, and her visions are flown; When loves, joys, and friendships for ever are o'er, Remembrance will linger on years that are gone!â O, Cumbria! thy pine-clad bills rise to my view; Thy wide-spreading valleys in livery of green; Thy hoarse-murm'ring streams where enraptur'd I flew, To mark the romantic, the heart-soothing scene; These still haunt my pillow, for there with the Muse, Forgetful of sorrows, I wove the rude song That nature dictated. Ah! who cou'd refuse To paint her gay pictures, thy wild woods among? And oft, in idea, with lingering pace, Thy landscape enchants, while thy meadows I tread, And o'er haunts of my youth, still with Spring fondly trace Her glories, new-born, that so lavish were spread: I wind Eden's stream, where I first sought the maid, Whose coy looks of witch'ry cou'd raptures impart; Or press thy dark woods, and each thrush-haunted glade, 'Mid the smiles of the few, ever dear to my heart. Ev'n now, when dun evening bedews these bleak vales, And pensive reflection past pleasure calls forth, I mark thy blithe groups, care no longer assails, Assemble, o'erjoy'd, round the neatly-trimm'd hearth. There wisdom is gather'd, of mortals and states, O'er heart-cheering liquor, in calumny's spite; News foreign or local, each freely narrates, And the song, jest, and story give wings to the night. But time, the destroyer, hath numbers laid low; Misfortune hath many to penury driv'n; And others have tasted the gall-drop of woe, To whom, when we parted, was happiness giv'n! There are, who from poverty's gripe have got free, The scoff of the wise, and the sport of the day: A thousand such changes, in fancy, I see, Since the hour when hope flatter'd, and tore me away. Yes! Cumbria, I mark where thy aged oaks stood; The groves where I pip'd with a heart free from care; Or thought, as I trac'd nature's works up to God, No bow'rs were so fragrant, no fields half so fair. Then oft would I sigh, but the wish, ah! how vain, That in youth and in manhood still clung to my breast, When death gave relief to all sorrow, all pain, Near the tombs of my fathers, in peace I might rest. Thus oft have I ponder'd, when day's toil was done, And Phoebus gave Erin his last ev'ning smile; When sicken'd with tumult, life's Autumn steals on, 'Tis sweet o'er past pleasures the hours to beguile. And oft have I said, why forgetful of me, Are the few sons of science, whose converse I shar'd? Sings the Bard of the Lyne now no longer with glee, For whom all the Muses a chaplet prepar'd? Long, long hath his page pour'd delight o'er the mind, For sacred to virtue, and sweet are his strains; O'er fancy's fair regions he roams unconfin'd, And the wish to instruct in his bosom still reigns: And fain with my Crito again would I range The groves and the bow'rs, where each tree seem'd a friend; And when we beheld, with a sigh, a sad change, Reflect, soon like them, we must wither and bend. But the gales to my ears brought the song of the Bard, That succour'd, like manna, from friendship's abode; âWhile flows the red current, the song I'll regard, That soothes a lone brother on life's flinty road! Thou chief of the number whose sanction I boast, Let friendship, long cherish'd, in death but expire; And whatever my fate on life's perilous coast, May I copy thy virtues, while list'ning thy lyre! Carnmoney, near Belfast. EPISTLE THE SEVENTH. TO MR. ROBERT ANDERSON, ON READING SOME OF HIS BEAUTIFUL POEMS IN THE BELFAST NEWS-LETTER, BY GAELUS. Mr. Andrew M'Kenzie, of Dunover, in the County of Down, who chuses the signature of Gaelus, is a man of considerable abilities. In 1810, he published a volume of Poems which have been much perused and justly admired. His works abound in moral sentiment, and prove him to be a favourite with the Muse, and a friend to his fellow creatures. Blessed with an amiable partner and a promising offspring, he enjoys in his humble sphere that domestic tranquillity which can only be attained by the virtuous. Hail Anderson! nature's sweet bard, (For nature gives birth to thy lay;) What praise could thy merit reward? What fame thy effusions repay? Permit me, tho' wild is the strain, My tribute of praise to bestow; Nor treat my rude verse with disdain, Since heartfelt esteem bids it flow. Thy songs with delight I have read, Which flow like a smooth-gliding stream, And sympathy's tear I have shed, As oft as distress was thy theme. Nor would I those pleasures resign, Which flow from thy sorrowful strain, To call the whole universe mine, And rank with the unfeeling train. Thy Outcast, poor victim of woe, I've heard on the desolate heath, And seen the sad suff'rer laid low, Releas'd from her sorrows by death. Thy Widow's affecting complaint, Might melt e'en a bosom of stone; What mortal could hear her lament. And not make her sorrows his own. Poor Annie's extravagant song Beguiles me of many a sigh; Such wild accents fall from her tongue, As oft steal a tear from my eye. Sweet Bard! what sensations divine Thy exquisite ditties impart! Simplicity dwells in each line, Yet strongly they speak to the heart. And still as I read with delight, Hope tells me of some happy day, When we shall in friendship unite, And sing all our sorrows away. Oh! come thou dear moment of joy! No anguish my bosom should rend, Nor care my sweet visions destroy, If blest with so gentle a friend. Sweet poet of nature! adieu! May fame be the meed of thy lays; That fame which no change will subdue, When time shall have number'd thy days! EPISTLE THE EIGHTH. TO GAELUS,ON THE PUBLICATION OF HIS POEMS. Whan cottars guid hae said their pray'rs, An' wee tots sleep awa' their cares, I musin', whyles think how it fares Wi' friens a few; But ane 'buin a', my wish aft sharesâ I hint at you: Wha (gifted wi the saul o' Burns, Whom monie a son o' wisdom mourns) Now soaring, saint-like, sunk by turns, Ay proud to gie Man maxims rare, that folly spurns, Appall'd to see. Yes, âwordy, wise, auld-farran'dâ Gaelus, Prince o' our poetizin fallows, The serious truths ye bauldly tell us, E'en gar us tremble; Wha scorns yer warks, deserves a gallows; I'll no' dissemble! Stern Winter's bleerin' frightfu form Now maks us creep our ingles warm; When readin' your true-pictur'd âStorm,â I think o' thae, Wretched, expos'd to ilka harm, Wha houseless stray. But neist your soothin' âBroken Heartâ Can dry the tear grief bids to start; Sic honied truths few Bards impart, In these rank times; They try owre aft, wi' strainin' art, To gild curs'd crimes. Your âBrook'sâ a type o' human kind, Warm frae a Bard's religious mind; Sic similies are weel design'd, The warl to cheer; And warn the wicked, weak, or blind, What course to steer. The Peasant trudgin' hame at een, Wi' heart untainted, thoughts serene, Aft minds me o' yoursel, and Jean, An weeans fair; Sic lines gie pamper'd chiels the spleen, But deil may care! Hail, nature's priest! unlike the lave, Wha light as air, or idly grave, Seek to bepraise some coward slave, In spite o' truth; Or wi' lewd rhymes, try to deprave Believing youth. Hale be thy pipe, Dunover's Bard! The day's at haun ye'll meet reward, For puir are ye; and times are hard, And claithin' dear; But thousans mae will ye regard, Ere this neist year. Yes Erin lang will bless yer name; Ay fain to raise her sons to fame; Ye'll put the guilty aft to shame, As sure as fate: Rise, An'rew! fair-earn'd honours claim, An' be na blate! For me, while I can think or luik, Whare'er I hurkle in a nuik, I'll pore wi' pleasure owre yer buik, An' bless the time, When Rab's advice ye fearfu' tuik, To print ilk rhyme. Ye've whyles glanc'd owre his plaintive sang, Studied auld Cumbria's glens amang, Whar monie a burnie rowes alang, An' mountain rill; Ah! dear-lov'd scenes! whare'er I gang, Ye haunt me still. Whare Thames majestic seeks the sea, I've stray'd; and by the streamless Cree, Whan grass-plot, cottage, shrub, or tree, Were seldom seen; Eden, my thoughts ay turn'd to thee, Mid' meadows green. I've liv'd, by warldlings aft dispis'd; By lovers o' the Muse whyles priz'd; But ne'er, no! ne'er could be advis'd, Tho' weak my lays, To wink at folly's whims disguis'd, Or vice to praise. Whyles, lad, I trust we'll meet thegether, In spite o' fortune, or rough weather; An' ablins comfort ane anither, In frienship blest: We suin slip aff, we ken no' whither, Let's hope the best! Life's like the journey o' a day, And pleasure leads us aft astray; Let friendship chace dull care away, As on we drive: I'm An'rew's frien, I proudly say, Lang may he thrive! Nae thought ye've wrote, ye e'er need blot, Nor carpin' bodies heed a jot; Content in hard-earn'd, hame-spun coat, Man needs nae mair; An' virtuous folk, howe'er forgot, Are ay Heav'n's care! Carnmoney, Oct. 29, 1809. EPISTLE THE NINTH. TO MISS B?Y, ON HER BIRTH-DAY. Sweet maid! thy birth a loftier verse doth claim, Than I, weak vot'ry of the Muse, can give; Tuneless my harp. Had I been known to fame, With such a theme, I'd hope my lays would live. All nature smiles around; enchanting sight! The feather'd throng their homage seem to pay; Ev'n Sol, with rays more glorious, shines more bright, As if rejoicing on thy natal day: For while he lights our earth, ne'er will he smile On one more worthy of a mortal's praise; On one more virtuous, or more free from guile, Unknown 'midst folly's throng, or fashion's blaze: And O, when many chearful years have flown, And thou to conq'ring time, like all, must bow; May calm reflection dwell on pleasures known, Nor sorrow till that hour e'er cloud thy brow! Belfast. EPISTLE THE TENTH. TO MARIA OF THE COTTAGE. Stern Winter frae the gelid north, Wi' monie a storm comes howling forth; And hills and glens are clad wi' sna': While cottars roun, are wrapp'd in sleep, O'er heartsome ingle fain I creep, An' think o' friens, far, far awa'. O' some nae mair I hope to see; O' some wha ware nae thoughts o' me; O' days when I to pleasure bow'd: Pleasure, that caus'd me mickle pain, And forc'd me aft the bowl to drain Wi' life's unthinkin' senseless crowd. Fuils tell us, friendship's but a name; They're blest wha feel the sacred flame, And hourly mak it brighter burn! Grant me but friens, upright, and leel, They'll mak me fearless o' the Deil; And warldly cuifs I'll bauldly scorn! Now exil'd frae the few I prize, The town, and its misnomer'd joys, In solitude some charms I find; Yes, e'en in obscure lowly cot, I thank my Maker for my lot, For plenty, health, an' peace o' mind. Contented wi' my daily toil; Pleas'd wi' ilk comrade's unfeign'd smile; What man needs wish, proud I enjoy: Henceforth, in quiet let me live, An' a' my thoughts to wisdom give, The guide, whase precepts ne'er can cloy. And thou, her daughter, to me dear, Wha strove to dry misfortune's tear, When mis'ry sunk my spirits low; Why now forgetfu' o' a friend, Thou wha sic counsel erst would lend, Ay first to soothe a suff'rer's woe? Has sickness numb'd thy tender frame? Wou'd slander sully thy fair fame? Does sorrow ca' thee still her ain? Has hope been busy wi' new art, To wound afresh thy feeling heart? Has peace for ever frae thee gane? Thou'st known enough o' pain and care; O' sorrow thou'st e'en had thy share, Sin youth ilk fairy picture drew: Envy has sought to work thy fall, Aft mix'd thy cup wi' bitterest gall; For days o' bliss hae been but few. Dear fav'rite o' the pensive Muse! Thy smile a rhymin' brither woos, O, quickly say, thou'rt yet his friend! May He wha stills the ragin' storm, Grant health, and shield thee ay frae harm, Till life's last peacefu scene shall end! EPISTLE THE ELEVENTH. TO A YOUNG LADY IN BELFAST Thanks for thy letter, best of friends! On it my life of life depends. Fair moralizer! whose warm heart May balm to any mind impart; I gaze enraptur'd on each line, Where wisdom shews in truths divine The dang'rous path, the wily snare, That still mislead, that cause each care; The pois'ners of man's purest joy, That wealth, and health, and life destroy. Dear beauteous comforter! whose smiles Ev'n sorrow of her sting beguiles, Whate'er thro' life my fate may be, My grateful thanks are due to thee; And till this pulse shall cease to beat, Thy name with ardour I'll repeat; Delighted, ever, to peruse Thy favors, fav'rite of the Muse! To thee, this humble verse I pour, The musing of a midnight hour; Weak flows the lay, my friend must own, For youth and fancy now are flown; I mark life's autumn, overcast, Whilst mem'ry pauses on the past: Truth holds her mirror to my view, And bids me virtue still pursue. No more of pleasure's airy round! Too long I've slept in rose-leaf'd bow'rs; And trod on fairy ground, With folly by my side; Nor number'd e'er the passing hours. For hope, delusive flatterer, was my guide; And with her fairest flow'rs, That blossoming did decay, She, smiling, strew'd my way; And life's short morn was nought but empty pride. By hope a willing victim led, Soon reason from me fled; Then pleas'd, each distant prospect fair With partial eye I view'd; And mock'd the busy spoiler care, And laugh'd to hear of man's ingratitude. Now wak'd, as from a dream, How sad, alas! I seem! While meek religion whispers, Heav'nwards turn! Then, O my thoughts surmount the sky, And from all worldly follies fly; Ere dim life's lamp begins to burn! While others vainly study how to live, Let me the hours to meditation give; And study how to die! EPISTLE THE TWELFTH. TO MR. ROBERT ANDERSON, ON HEARING HIM SAY HIS MUSE HAD PAID HIM A VISIT FOR THE FIRST TIME, SINCE HIS RETURN TO CARLISLE, BY THOMAS WANNUP, OF GREAT CORBY. Rejoice with me, ye vocal train, And raise the cheerful rustic strain; Our Cumbrian Bard, with glee again, The song renews: Nor grief, nor absence, can restrain His generous Muse. The sight of native fields and skies, Revives the thoughts of youthful joys; Thoughts absence blunts, but ne'er destroys, And hark! his reed, With double sweetness he employs In dale and mead. And thou, our Bard, though 'tis not thine In battle's gory scenes to shine; Scenes which too oft, in strains divine, The Muses sing;â And oh! with glory deeds combine, That ruin bring. Nor mercenary talents thee Have taught to bend the servile knee; Though modest, humble, thou art free, And know'st thy soul To aid oppression, bribe, or fee, Need'st no controul. But thou hast been our fields among, And thou hast mark'd the rural throng; Our griefs and joys to thee belong, And thine's the art To soothe the mind with tender song, And cheer the heart. Sing on, sweet Bard, thy country's friend;â Amuse, delight, instruct, amend; And whilst our weal you ardent 'tend, When faults you see, Spare not the kindly lash; we'll bend, And thankful be. So may'st thou live to see the day, To wear an honour'd pow of grey; When wife, and maid, united say, And sire and son,â âWe aw for thee will gratefu' pray, R. Anderson.â EPISTLE THE THIRTEENTH. TO MR. THOS. WANNUP, OF GREAT CORBY. Dear friend! (for friends too oft are few) Thank Heaven! I boast of numbers true; May such have happiness in view, And rest in peace; Still scorning the tyrannic crew, Who cares increase. O that 'twere mine the pow'r to serve Those, who a brother's praise deserve,â Those who, rejoic'd, would strain each nerve The poor to save; Ne'er from that duty would I swerve Till in the grave! But mortals' wishes oft are vain; Oft prove the source of care and pain; While some, exulting, seek to gain What leads to woe,â Ne'er may I scorn, with cold disdain, Where much I owe. Return'd to each lov'd native scene, Rocks, wood-crown'd hills, and valleys green, Tho' long my Muse hath absent been, With me she roves, To paintâwhat may give some the spleen, But merit moves. Still may she wear the rustic dress, And soothe the suff'rer in distress; Now thousands round roam pennyless, Of health bereft,â That men may such with plenty bless, Few hopes are left. Still may she mark each loving pair, Who life enjoy, and laugh at care, Who steer the course that's bright and fairâ To peace inclin'd; Who scorn the world's entangling snare, And serve mankind. Yes, mine the theme shall ever be, Friends to amuse with harmless glee; To let the virtuous ploughman see A portrait true; For nature's rural scenes, to me, Are still in view. Those who oppose a brother's right; The upstart proud; the worthless wight; The wretch who errs in reason's spite, May purchase praise; Such, only, who in good delight, Should grace our lays. Dear friend! to whom my thanks are due; Till time to death shall bid thee bow, May no dull cares e'er cloud thy brow, But joy prevail; And proud thy offspring speed the plough O'er hill and dale. In fancy, I thy fields survey; Thro' Corby's woods and valleys stray, At op'ning morn, or evening grey, In many a grove, Where minstrels sweet their homage pay To Him above. When rakes their midnight revels keep, I trace the scenes near Eden deep;â Oft that romantic rocky steep, Where thousands bend; And now, in age, I'll proudly creep, To meet my friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME II MISCELLANIES. THE WIDOW. ââMumbling to herself; Her eyes with scalding rheum were gall'd and red; Cold palsy shook her head; her hands seem'd wither'd. And o'er her crook'd shoulders had she wrapp'd The tatter'd remnant of an old stripp'd hanging, Which could not keep her carcase from the cold.â Otway. Why sighs yon wretched being, whose patch'd weeds Shield not her shrivell'd body from the blast, Who oft along the pathway's frozen side, In vain for fuel seeks?âWhy from her eyes, That languid turn to Heav'n, imploring rest, Adown their well-known course fall the big tears? She weeps not at her growing poverty, Nor envies e'er the splendour of the world; But, mourning, sighs for long departed joys: Alas! her all is gone!âNo monarch's wealth Can to her mind lost happiness restore; Since he, her only hope, her only pride, Her only son, her age's sole support, Torn from his home, soon fill'd a wat'ry grave. An aged Widow, much she lov'd to gaze On him, a father's image. He, in youth, Regardless of all else, save one, would toil With his companion, chearfulness, the day; And oft the mountain's rugged brow he'd climb, To mark his distant dear-lov'd humble cot, And think with pleasure on his boyish years, Life's happy morn, when care gives way to mirth: Then would he anxious cull each wild-flow'r fair, Type of her beauty that had fir'd his breast; And proud was he at evening to behold A parent's fondness in a parent's smiles; A cot, the humble dwelling of content; And one, the sharer of his infant sports, His Mary; child of innocence, whose face Was fair, and seem'd the index of a mind, Pure as the unsullied snow-drop, gentle flow'r, The timid harbinger of welcome Spring, That drooping, chides dull Winter as it dies. Robb'd of her William, she would sit and weep, And think of him, and vainly try to sing; Then gaze with tears upon the braided hair: Now stop her wheel, and with an anxious look, Enquire of many a wand'rer by her home, The news, heart-rending news, of murd'rous war; And if perchance some letter'd hind should read With joyous stare, full of anxiety, The list of bloodshed, gazetted bombast, Then would poor Mary tremble, with deep sighs, While down her cheek roll'd many a pearly tear; For she had learn'd to feel for others' woe. Oft while the villagers at ease were laid In sleep's soft lap, she'd listen to the wind, Whose hollow murmurs chill'd her heart with fear; Then think of dangers he'd to undergo, And sleepless, welcome morning's slow approach. But soon the rose fled from her beauteous cheek, And left the lily mourning for its loss; A prey to sorrow Mary ling'ring fell, Wept and lamented by the rustics round. Sad was the slow procession; dull each look, As thro' the lanes they bore this wither'd bud, To the low house whose steeple points to Heav'n: And when the coffin to the earth was giv'n, At âdust to dust,â the Curate, pious guide, Let fall a tear. The author cannot help lamenting, that the custom of reading the funeral service, so prevalent throughout England, should not be equally attended to in the sister countries. There is not surely a more proper time for impressing on the minds of our fellow-creatures a just sense of their duty, than when they witness the frailty of life, and follow a departed relative or friend to the house appointed for all living. The Sexton, grey in years, Whose look observ'd he'd long forgot to feel, Reclining on his spade, e'en heav'd a sigh: And as the sprig of box flew to the grave, The village train, the feeble, and the young, Blest Mary, virtuous maid, for ever gone. The tidings never reach'd her William's ear, For he too fell; unwilling sacrifice To wild ambition, and ere death's cold hand Snatch'd from his youthful cheek its wonted bloom, In falt'ring accents, with uplifted eyes, He call'd to Heav'n a parent to defend; Then prostrate on the deck, midst comrades brave, Sunk, oft repeating his lov'd Mary's name.â Thus fall our hardy brethren, innocent, To please ambition in its foul career! 'Tis she, his mother, who, with tott'ring steps, Unknowing whither, o'er the wild heath strays, And, to the flocks, and tenants of the groves, Talks many an hour away. One comrade still She keeps, a fond, half-starv'd, but faithful brute. Tray was her William's once, and leaves her not; But licks the hand which seldom holds him food. In roofless cot, alas! poor Margaret lives, A joy-forsaken, faded, mark of woe; Of reason reft, and robb'd of ev'ry stay, Save Him who registers pale misery's cry, And marks each hour of anguish. Oft with tears, She to the stranger tells a broken tale; Amidst her sighs pouring to Heav'n a pray'r, To shed its vengeance on their guilty heads, Who glory in destruction. Happiness, She knows the world, unfeeling, cannot give To her pain'd bosom; and for charity, The mourner asketh never. Woe-worn wretch! Like thee what numbers drink the cup of grief, And sorrow ever nurse; perchance to feed The growing evils of a falling state: Or pamper purple pride, who, callous grown, With eye abhorrent, scowls on wretchedness. Peace to thy bosom, poor unfortunate! O may the friendly arm of death strike soon! And soon it must, to set thy sorrows free. They, too, who fatten on the spoils of war, Like thee, must fall a prey to kindred worms. Thus all things have an end. The proudest state, With the rude cottage, in their turns must fall; And Prince and Peasant mingle with the dust! STANZAS ON VISITING A MOTHER'S GRAVE. A strain of egotism is surely allowable, when the most tender emotions of the heart are forced into action, by a visit to the tomb of an affectionate parent. Then, and only then, the dearest scenes of life are recalled to imaginationâscenes that occurred long ere sorrow had occasioned us to suspect the wily deeds of man: delighted with the retrospective glance, we proudly exclaim, such things were, but never must return! Adjoining St. Mary's Cathedral, Carlisle, in the north west corner, behind every one, are interred many of my ancestors and relatives. No sculptured tale of truth or falsehood marks the place; for alas! they had to struggle against poverty, and toil their day of life âunknowing and unknown.â These simple stanzas were written after an absence of many years from my native place, and can only be acceptable to such readers as cherish the remembrance of a mother's solicitude. âView the tomb with sculpture splendid, View the sod with briars bound; There the farce of finery's ended,â All are equal under ground: Wise men, weak ones, poor, and wealthy, Tenant unremitting graves; Haughty, humble, sick, and healthy, Britain's sons and Afric's slaves!â G. A. Stevens. I, to the Church-yard went to see The spot where my poor Mother's laid, When quick the tears gush'd from my eye;â I hung my head like one afraid; And thought of all the anxious days, And restless nights for me she bore; A puny thing, ill worth her care, Then did I sigh, and weep the more. 'Twas sorrow's luxury to see The sod that wrapp'd a parent's clay, And on that narrow spot of earth, O, I could weep the hours away! I tore a nettle from her tomb! Why should a rank weed flourish there? O'er one who virtue made her guide, Pale prey to sickness, want, and care. Oft do I mark the humble shed, Where blythe was spent life's op'ning day; And oft, at eve, I trace the fields Where she would fondly with me stray; And oft I seek the place of graves, Where one I water with a tear; And still her spirit seems to say, Prepare in time to rest thee here! And oft I think of that sad hour, When she was to the dust consign'd; Soon eager beat my guileless heart To seek the world, to know mankind: The world I saw, mankind I loved, And heedless sail'd down pleasure's stream: Now, busy mem'ry loud proclaims, Life's morning's all a fev'rish dream! Near to that little mound of earth, Fain would I rest my wearied head, For I'm a joyless pilgrim here, And none would seek my narrow bed. Reflection wounds me in the past; To-morrow brings not hope to me; O, sainted form! O, parent blest! Would I had bow'd to earth with thee! I think of eve's long wish'd-for hours, When joyous home from school I flew; And with affection's dearest kiss, My arms around her neck I threw. Tho' luxury our board ne'er grac'd, 'Midst poverty content was giv'n, And all that wealth or wisdom boast, Are nought without this boon of Heav'n! Still could I find a haven of rest On her pure bosom, fondly lov'd; And all hope's wanton dreams of bliss, Were, with a smile, by her approv'd: Her lessons led to virtue's path; Her num'rous sorrows were made mine; And ever present is her look, When now I welcome life's decline. Long ere ten times I'd seen blythe spring Spread o'er the earth her fost'ring dews, Cold were the lips I weeping kiss'd, And I was told heart-rending news. Whate'er my fate, whate'er my care, While in this frame life's pulse shall beat, All worldly ills I'll patient bear, And fondly hope with her to meet. INSCRIPTION WRITTEN AT CORBY CASTLE, THE ROMANTIC SEAT OF HENRY HOWARD, ESQ. âLet others praise the Leasowe's plains, Where Shenstone tun'd his love-lorn strainsâ What, tho' he sung of groves, and bow'rs; Of winding paths bestrewn with flow'rs; Of murmuring streamlets, echoing glades, Woods, lawns, and minstrel-haunted shades; His lambkins sporting near the brook, His garland, pipe, or shepherd's crook; 'Twas Art and Fancy brought to view, What Nature here presents to you.â Reader, if rocks, woods, waters, lawns, and meads, Or aught of nature's captivating dress,â If warbling hymns in the Creator's praise, Pour'd all around from many a balmy brake, Thy mind can charm; thrice welcome to these shades, Where peace and mild content for ever dwell. Now while thy wearied limbs at rest are laid, In some sequester'd bow'r free from all noise; Save melodies from many a woodland choir, Or Eden murm'ring o'er his rocky bed: Bethink thee, as the waters glide along, So pass thy days; but never to return. If e'er the lofty pine attract thine eye, 'Twill lead thy thoughts to Heav'n. In musing mood, The wide-stretched mountain, the proud oak-crown'd rock, The wood of many hues, the far-heard stream, The sportive flock that graze the velvet lawn; Nay ev'n the grassy turf o'er which we tread, Green habitation of the insect world, Each speaks in silent eloquence of God. Perchance, in quest of rural nook thou stray'st, A stranger to these much-lov'd scenes; then know, The virtuous owners of this blest abode, By justice, charity, and boundless love, Endearing man to man, examples great, Give lustre never-fading to the spot. If in thy bosom beats a patriot's heart, Indignant at the threats and murd'rous deeds Of him, thy happy country's high-swol'n foe; Lo! Howard hails thee, welcome to his seat. But should cold apathy enslave thy mind, And thou of England's weal regardless roam'st; Or feel'st not for thy brethren, Afric's sons, By Europeans torn from friends and home, Exil'd for ever for thy luxuries; Weak votary to pleasure, pride, or pow'r, Hence, laugh with folly in the noisy town! July, 1803. MAN WAS NOT MADE TO MOURN. â'Tis better to be cheerful, than indulge in weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth.â âSorrow breaks seasons, and reposing hours; Makes the night morning, and the noontide night!â Shakspeare. The sinking sun, aslaunt the hill, Bade labour quit the plough; And now in monie a window keek'd To bid mankind adieu: When musing on towards a wood, Where joyous youth was spent, Beneath an oak a carle stood, Whase body time had bent. His locks were silver'd o'er wi' years, His claithing coarse and bare; But cheerfu' seem'd his honest heart, That had known mickle care: Life's spark, tho' drawing near its end, Yet cheerfully did burn; In him, I read an aged friend, Wha had forgot to mourn. âStranger,â quoth he, âwhere wander'st thou, Amid the dews of eve? Thine eye, methinks, is wet wi' woe, Why shun the world to grieve? O hear a wight, whom age has taught! Nor mock his years wi' scorn; Be not in youth by sorrow caughtâ Man was not made to mourn! âFor me, I'm puir as puir can be, Wha ance cou'd boast o' wealth; And wan and wither'd is this cheek, Whare late sat blooming health: On earth I am but fortune's sport, And wander here forlorn; What then, life's journey is but short, And why shou'd mortals mourn? â'Tis hard to lose a partner dear, Or parent fondly kind; 'Tis hard to lose a friend sincere, Of independent mind: Tho' sweet's the tear by pity shed, O'er gentle virtue's urn, Yet be not sorrow's captive ledâ Man was not made to mourn! âHast thou been robb'd of a' thy kin, That thus thou heav'st a sigh? Or griev'st thou for a faithfu' friend, On whom thou cou'd'st rely? A friendless brother here behold; Death a' frae me has torn; Yet something bids me ay be boldâ Man was not made to mourn! âHast thou by hope been aft beguil'd, Or sail'd down pleasure's stream? And started back frae ruin's brink, Like ane wak'd frae a dream? Tho' monie cares on pleasure wait, Frae which 'tis wise to turn; Repentance never is too late, Then why shou'd mortals mourn? âOr enviest thou yon pamper'd lord, Wha rules at pleasure's ball? Let plenty smile upon his board, And numbers wait his call; That wealth is giv'n him but in trust, Tho' he at puirtith spurn; The man wha puir dares to be just, Hath little cause to mourn! âThe pow'r wha rules yon rising orb, And sits abuin the sky, Hath giv'n to man an angel form, But wills that he shall die: Then what avails all earthly bliss, Since we to dust return? A better world there is than this, And why should mortals mourn? âA' nature view:âThe herds that graze Alang the meads, rejoice; The sangsters chaunt their gratefu' lays, Wi' one accordant voice: To lordly man is reason giv'n, Yet oft the poor forlorn, By madd'ning passions wildly driv'n, Hopeless, lives but to mourn. âHowe'er on life's rough sea thou'rt crost, 'Tis folly to despair; The feeblest bark, when tempest-tost, Some kind relief may share: Still cherish hope, that peacefu' guest, Nor from Religion turn; Then will no tumult swell thy breast, Nor thou have cause to mourn!â Here ceas'd the sage; and sought his way Along the dark'ning vale; But oft his meek instructive voice Seem'd passing on each gale. Ne'er may I from these rules depart, Till down to earth I'm borne; But think, in spite of learned art, Man was not made to mourn! OUR SAILORS. âO protect the hardy Tar, Be mindful of his merit! And when again you're plung'd in war He'll shew his daring spirit!â Rushton. Sing, Muse, tho' feeble be thy strain, Those who our liberties maintain, Who fearless triumph on the mainâ Our Sailors! When freedom, property, and laws, Are threaten'd by tyrannic foes, Who first espouse the glorious cause? Our Sailors! Who scorn the despot stain'd with blood, And scare his navies o'er the floodâ Destroy them, for our country's good? Our Sailors! Who act thro' life an honest part? Who always shew the gen'rous heart? Who're dup'd by many a villain's art? Our Sailors! Who ever dry misfortune's tear, Nor sorrow's tale refuse to hear; Each helpless outcast proud to cheer? Our Sailors! Who guard our coast, protect the fair? Who death and danger nobly dare? Who bravely conquer, but to spare? Our Sailors! Who still supply our groaning boards, With ev'ry dainty earth affords? Who pity Gallia's vaunting hordes? Our Sailors! Who brave hidd'n rocks, and dang'rous seas? Who bear the pestilential breeze? Who taste not luxury nor ease? Our Sailors! Who mid' the tempest's threat'ning blast, Toil, fearless, on the giddy mast, Or, cheerful sing, of dangers past? Our Sailors! Who death can face, without alarm, In battle's rage, terrific storm, When light'nings blue Heav'n's face deform? Our Sailors! Who, shipwreck'd on a foreign coast, When many a merry comrade's lost, Still happy Albion make their boast? Our Sailors! To them we owe whate'er we prize, Domestic pleasuresâsocial tiesâ Woe unto him who dare despise Our Sailors! Indignant, let the Muse reveal, Nor deeds oppressive dare conceal, But tell the pangs they're doom'd to feel, Our Sailors! Eager to hail their native land! Eager to press some kindred hand, While friendship greets along the strand, Our Sailors! A wife's embrace, a prattler's smile, An honest welcome, free from guile, These make forgetful of past toil Our Sailors! Oh! mark the ruthless fiends appear, And from each dear connection tear Men, who should be their country's care, Our Sailors! Blush! Britons, blush! to have it told, That to the tender's putrid hold Fell hirelings, cow'rdly, force the bold, Our Sailors! Peace to thy bosom, feeling Bard! Mr. Edward Rushton, of Liverpool, Bookseller. The Poems of this Author discover extraordinary powers of mind, and genuine feeling. During the years of youth, he served as Doctor, on board a Liverpool trader; and it was owing to this circumstance, that he felt so deeply the cruelties inflicted on our brethren, the Sons of Africa. He was unfortunately deprived of sight, on the coast of Guinea; and for upwards of thirty years laboured under that melancholy calamity, respected and pitied by all ranks of mankind. During this period, he used every exertion for the suppression of that disgraceful traffic, the Slave Trade. In a letter to General Washington, he pays him every praise for his talents shewn in the field or the senate; but censures his conduct with great severity for being a dealer in Slaves. This letter, which went through many editions, gained him the esteem of all who could boast a spirit of independence. His love of mankind dictated to him, as a proper subject for his Muse, the horrid custom of impressing seamenâa custom which has long thrown a foul stain on the British government. It is but justice to this philan-thropist to declare, he has written some of the most interesting songs of which our language can boast. Posterity have a right to consider themselves deeply indebted to our British Cicero, the Right Honourable Charles James Fox. The last public act of that illustrious statesman, was the abolition of the Slave Trade; an inhuman traffic, by which the world was long degraded. Who suff'ring brethren didst regard; And call'd on Britons, to reward Our Sailors! While British Tars are dear to fame So long thy song shall praises claim; And grateful will they bless thy name, Our Sailors! MIDNIGHT REFLECTIONS. âNight on the earth pour'd darkness; on the sea, The wakesome sailor to Orion's star And Helice turn'd heedful. Sunk to rest, The traveller forgot his toil; his charge The centinel; her death-devoted babe, The mother's painless breast. The village dog Had cas'd his troublous bay. Each busy tumult Was hush'd at this dead hour; and darkness slept, Lock'd in the arms of silence.â Apollonius Rhodius. âNight mounts her curtain'd wane; The dancing stars compose her filial train; Black muffl'd sleep steals on with silent pace, And dreams flit fast, imagination's race.â Now o'er the face of nature, night has thrown Her sable mantle. Cynthia's silver beam Shews not the distant bay, the vessel's course, On which I love to ponder, from this height: Pale empress, pleasing ever, she illumes Some clime far distant. There, on giddy mast, How many a seaman views that cheering orb; Then thinks of parents, kindred, wife, and friends. Perchance, hope whispers how a faithful fair May sighing, trembling, view the bright expanse; While oft she prays for his long-wish'd return. He toils submissive, scorning to complain; And laughs at danger. Think, ah! think ye proud, From midnight revels freed, what he endures, To store your groaning boards with pois'nous sweets, That make you oft the hardy peasant's scoff. Ne'er let ingratitude to him give pain, Who, shame on man, oft torn from all he loves, Braves sultry climes, hidden rocks, and pow'rful foes, Proud of his country. Silence reigns around, Save the rain patt'ring on the casement rude, Driv'n by the breeze. It seems the voice of Heaven, And still should make us mindful of the cause. Oft at this hour, methinks 'tis sweet to muse, On perils we've encounter'd, and escap'd; Of sicknesses, too soon, alas! forgot: Then dive into futurity's dark womb, And lead the mind to death's sure, near approach. To me, when wearied with day's studious toil, It seems betimes life's luxury supreme, Self-exil'd from the land which gave me birth, In nook retir'd, far from the hum of man, To think of youthful friends, for ever lost; Of parents, relatives, sunk to the dust: To trace with sages o'er my taper dim, The various changes on life's busy stage, Of states and mortals. Nor mispent the time, Giv'n to the Muse; tho' woo'd too oft in vain. Rear'd on the lap of humblest poverty, By those who vainly sought coy fortune's smile, The rays of learning ne'er illum'd my mind: Yet, though debarr'd the joys of wealth and science, While virtue dictates for another's weal, The song that soothes a brother on his way, My pipe shall not hang idly 'gainst the wall; Tho' feeble be its tone. The simple rhyme, The moral thought, of one unknown to fame, An ear may please, and turn a mind from vice. Not reft of feelingânow the clock hath told The noon of nightâO! I could weep for those, The houseless wand'rers 'mid the savage blast, Poor wretched outcasts of society! Torn by our faithless sex from virtue's seat; Reflecting neverâmaking vice a trade. âAh! nature shudders at the dark-wrought scene! He sleeps not, now, the helpless wretch, immur'd Within yon gloomy prison's Carrickfergus. dark dank cell, Th' insolvent debtor, from his friends exil'd. Health smiles no longer on him; and alas! The thoughts of happy years, long since flown by, Prompt daily sighs, and break the night's repose. His partner, offspring, driven to penury, Woe-worn, and sickly, begging oft in vain, For ever haunt him on his scanty straw.â But 'tis the will of proud relentless man, Whose heart, âflint to the core,â ne'er learn'd to feel; And law's loud voice must own such deeds are just. Bear light thy sorrows, heartless son of want; Let christian fortitude soothe each distress; Thy country boasts the wealthy and the good, Who feel indignant at a brother's woes; And still may such enjoy the suff'rer's praise. âStill be this truth engraven on each mind; Life's but a prison! Princes breathe enchain'dâ Death to the virtuous only, freedom gives! How many, reckless of this solemn hour, In yon proud town of commerce, Belfast. idly waste The time in riot, and intemp'rate joys! The midnight ball, the splendid shew of pride, The costly viands, or the mazy dance, To them alone have charms. Thrice happier he, The peaceful peasant, who from hardy toil, Asks but the frugal meal nature requires. âMan's real wants are few. From luxury, Spring countless cares, that poison life's few years! The cottage children of this straw-roof'd shed, In sleep's soft arms, dream o'er their little sports. Blest cherubs!âAh! what bitter storms may blight Such op'ning buds, exceeds proud mortals' ken. Rest on. Peace to your slumbers, happy boys! Rest on. A few short years may see you drawn Into the wily snares of wicked men. Or, ere another moon lights these brown hills, Perhaps you're doom'd to hasten to the grave; And sorrow-sunk, your parents leave in pain. âGod's will be done!â'Tis weakness to repine! How different those stretch'd on the bed of death, Who count each lazy minute as it flies; Praying for morn's approach, and mourning still. Hope tells, another day may bring them ease; But hope too oft deceives the giddy brain. Be patient, sons of sickness; mindful still That virtuous deeds, though scorn'd by Mammon's train, Will meet a sure reward. Remember, too, The Ruler of the winds can only grant A healing balm to sorrow or disease. The thousand cares which agitate frail man, During the glare of day, are hush'd to rest. Emotions dire of envy, pangs of pride, Tortures of jealousy, and fears of want; Doubts, sorrows, pains, fancied perplexities, Loves ill-requited, friendships unreturn'd, A while are all forgotten. On his couch, Encanopied with velvet, the proud Prince, Who conquers kingdoms, millions keeps in awe, And revels on the lap of luxury, Tastes not more sweets than doth the wretch low born, Who nestles in his straw. Then since 'tis thus, That not ev'n honors, pow'r, or pride of birth, Yea, all the wealth Golconda's mountains yield, Can smooth the brow of care; why will frail man Repining, fret his few short years away? Let me, whate'er the ills I'm doom'd to bear, Spite of the proud man's scorn, the wise one's sneer, Be thankful, ever, to the King of kings! TEA. Let Gripus ill-got gow'd ay hoard; Let dainties deck ilk glutton's board; Gie trinkums to yon pamper'd lord, Ambition's slave! Wi' hamely fare, a table stor'd, Is a' I crave! Heart-cheerin' bev'rage, weel-brew'd Tea, SouchongâImperial, or Boheaâ Or leel, or sad, I lo'e to see Thy dark streams flow; To young and auld, ay dear thou'lt be, Care's welcome foe! Tho' slander raves, while o'er thee set, An' maks weak heartless bodies fret; Just sae, o'er dear-bought wines, when met A drouthie crew, Puir modest worth can seldom get The tribute due. Peace to his saul, wha brought thee o'er First to auld Albion's craggy shore; For some years after Tea was first brought to England, it was seldom used; and its qualities were by many considered exceedingly dangerous. The Author remembers hearing his mother relate the following:âAt the first Tea party she visited, a quantity was put into a large porridge pot, and boiled, together with butter and salt. Each person was served with a horn spoon; but wry faces soon shewed their dislike to the mess. One opinion influenced all present, which was, if the broth was fat, it was unco bitter! Ne'er dreamt the chiel, the shrub he bore By cuifs despis'd, While wild woods wave, and billows roar, Will ay be priz'd. While monie tuim the reemin stoup, That thraws the strangest on his doupe, How happy they, wha form a groupe, Thy balm to share! Thou, nor destroy'st the puir man's hope, Nor adds to care. Thou serv'st for drinkâthou serv'st for meatâ Among the lower orders in China, it is customary after drinking the liquid, to eat the leaves of Tea. By so doing, they imagine many diseases are prevented from taking effect. The human mind is not, in any part of the known world, more subdued by prejudice than in that country. To king and cottar thou'rt a treat; Frae tiny weeans, lispin' sweet, To age bent down, 'Mid Norlan frosts, or Suthern heat, Weel art thou known. To fam'd Sam Johnson Some Biographers, who were personally acquainted with this Colossus of Literature, have asserted that he frequently drank fourteen cups of Tea during the evening. thou wert dear! The kettle's sang he lo'ed to hear; Nae organ's swellin' notes cou'd e'er Sic joy impart; And warm'd by thee, his converse clear Charm'd ilka heart. Howard It is recorded of this great Philanthropist, that on returning home from the Continent, his first request was, that Tea might be prepared with all possible speed. to sordid int'rest blind, Wha sought to succour a' mankind, In thee cou'd ay a solace find, When welcom'd hame; For thou wert gien to soothe the mindâ Prais'd be thy name! O'er thee, I've studied monie a sang, When blasts blew wild, and nights were lang; Such, wisdom's chiels may ay think wrang; Spite o' their lear, Wha rhymes to gie grim vice a bang, Has nought to fear! O'er thee, I've tasted luive's pure joy, An' aft suppress'd the risin' sigh: Nae mair the wee deceitfu' boy Can cause alarms; His powerfu' dart I dare defy, An' beauty's charms! O'er thee, I've griev'd for monie a wight, An' schem'd to mak his sorrows light: While I hae pow'r R. A. to write, Be this my plan, The lave to help, but ne'er to slight Puir luckless man! O'er thee, in youth, and now in age, Mankind I've trac'd on monie a page; The patriot bauld, the deep-learn'd sage, The grave divine; The pension'd tribe, wha vauntin rage, But ne'er can shine. O'er thee, I pray to see the day, When toil-worn man, o'er lang a prey To star-clad brithers, shall be gay; An' bless the hour, When tyranny 'gan to decay, An' lose his pow'r. O'er thee, I've thought wi' heartfelt scorn, O' what ilk mortal yet shou'd mourn; How Afric's sons frae hame were torn, An' basely sauld; Blush, Britons! at sic deeds, hell-born, Whene'er their tauld! I mind what comfort thou cou'd'st gie, Whan todlen roun my minny's knee; An' lang as I hae pow'r to prie, At morn and eve, Be mine sax cups o' wholesome Tea, I'll scorn to grieve! Wae wait the loons! few be their days, Wha'd folk destroy wi' leaves o' slaes, An' pois'nous weeds, their walth to raise, Spite o' our laws! May auld Nick on sic deadly faes Suin fix his claws! Ye fair, wi' whom I've far'd fu' bra', Peace to yer bosoms, ane an' a'! An achin head ne'er may ye cla', But lang be blest; An' Tea yer troubles wash awa', Till sunk in rest! Ye chiels whom I hae cause to prize, Wha Tea wi' me wou'd ne'er despise; Wha wish'd me ay the wale o' joys, An' sooth'd ilk care; Leel be yer hearts, my merry boys, When I'm nae mair! LOUISA, A BALLAD. Where yon tall pine nods o'er the deep, And murm'ring chides each passing gale, Louisa oft would sit and weep, And tell, with broken sighs, her tale. âWhat dost thou gaze at, village youth? Why down thy cheek rolls the big tear? Why press thy finger on thy mouth? Louisa's tale, boy, would'st thou hear? âThe hips and haws are oft my food; The nearest water drink supplies; My bed is in the thickest wood, But sleepless oft with morn I rise! âThou little girl, with rosy cheek, To thee the villain man's unknown; He'll woo thee, but thy ruin seek, Then soon thy happiness is flown! âArt thou an only parent's care? I, too, had once a mother dear! Hie home! her smiles, her blessings shareâ No more my sorrows shalt thou hear!â Thus sunk a prey to want and grief, The world no pleasure could impart; Friendship could lend her no relief, Nor pity heal a broken heart. With woe-worn looks, in wild despair, Now she'd repeat a lover's name; Now gaze on one, her only care, The living record of her shame. Now in each feature, fondly trace The look, that did her heart betray; Then bending o'er his beauteous face, Would weep the ling'ring hours away. âAh! pretty babe!â she oft would cry, âThy smile but deeper wounds my breast! Where, where from mis'ry can we fly? The grave's our only place of rest! âAh! pretty babe! no father hears Thy tongue its lisping tales repeat; No lover dries thy mother's tears, Nor marks her painful bosom beat! âBe sorrow poor Louisa's lot! Yet still her pray'r shall be to Heav'n, That tho' by Henry now forgot, His wrongs to her may be forgiv'n!â A stranger now to all repose, No more the mourner hop'd for peace; And Heav'n, in pity to her woes, Soon bade Louisa's sorrows cease. Where yon tall spire o'er-tops the height, And many a place of rest is seen, There wanders one from morn to night; Guilt marks his look and alter'd mien. He heeds no stranger's proffer'd aid, Nor chilling rain, nor piercing blast; But near the aged yew-tree's shade, For ever thinks of what is past. On one he looks, to one he speaks, Whom oft he prays kind Heav'n to save; And with his babe, the Maniac seeks Wild flow'rs, to deck Louisa's grave. ODE TO POVERTY. â'Tis better to be lowly born, And range with humble livers, in content, Than to be perk'd up in a glitt'ring grief, And wear a golden sorrow.â Shakspeare. âThe learn'd is happy, nature to explore; The fool is happy, that he knows no more; The rich is happy in the plenty giv'n: The poor contents him with the care of Heav'n. Pope. Hail Poverty! in tatter'd weeds array'd; The scorn of wealth, and all the gay-deck'd crowd; Oft by thy sons despis'd, Who bow to pride. Tho' in thy train, the spectre, care, appears, With wrinkl'd sorrow, pale-fac'd misery, These haunt the costly pile, Where grandeur dwells. Then wherefore shall men shudder at thy name, Unmindful of the fix'd decrees of fate? To Him who rules on high, We all must bow. Death waits alike the portals of the great, And the craz'd cottage. Virtue makes us blest; And when she deigns to smile, She ne'er deceives. No foe art thou to genius. They whose names Immortal live, high on the rolls of fame, Companions were of thine, Yet died in peace. What Bard than Dryden tun'd more sweet the lyre? And who like Otway call'd forth pity's tear? Still Butler's humour gives To laughter birth. While seasons roll, and nature speeds her course, While liberty shall swell the virtuous breast, Still Thomson's classic lays New praise will claim! While Scotia's sons shall harmony admire, The mournful dirge sublime, the past'ral song, The magic verse of Burns Mankind shall charm! Erin, dear Isle! of courts the scorn, the scourge! Long as the shamrock marks thy fertile vales, Thy Goldsmith's name shall rise, A country's pride! Hail Poverty! the wisest, and the best Of Kings, Alfred the Great. to whom our dearest rights we owe, With thee enjoy'd content, In lowly guise. The arts, the sciences, thou ne'er forsak'st; Thy sons, industrious, claim our nation's care; Their deeds on land and main, The world well knows. Let not proud mortals cast a scornful sneer At toil-worn brethren, still their chief support; The lordling and the slave Bow to the tomb! Unwelcome visitor, by millions deem'd, Like day's bright orb thou'rt to no state confin'd; Where'er man treads the earth, There art thou found. My parents, kindred, still own'd thee a guest: Thou rock'd my cradle; watch'd my youthful years; And now, in life's decline, Attend'st me still. Tho' dark the prospect of my future days, Unfriended traveller in this dreary vale; Blest with the Muse and health, I'll ne'er repine. Then, hail! companion of life's chequer'd scenes, Who ne'er forsook me, nor wert e'er despis'd; With thee I've liv'd in peace, With thee must die! INSCRIPTION FOR AN OAK SEAT ON THE SUMMIT OF A HILL. Stop, gentle traveller, on this rude Seat, Rest thee awhile; and ponder on mankind: Turn nature's volume o'er, with prying eye, And in each page thou'lt find a sweet reward. If thou hast journey'd long thro' life's dark vale, And poverty hath thy companion been, Offend not God, by murmuring at his will; But let religion ever be thy guide. Remember what thou art; what thou must be; How life's dull path is short, o'er which thou stray'st, And thou art on eternity's dread brinkâ Eternity!âAh! word but little weigh'd! Now turn thine eye, yon mansion gay behold, Its parks, its pleasure grounds, diverted streams, Lakes, woods umbrageous, temples, and cascades, Where art with nature almost dares to vie; And if thou envy'st its proud pamper'd lord, Whose pow'r and rich domains extend afar; Check the vain thought. Know wealth is rapt in cares, And but the virtuous are the truly great! If fortune's favours, traveller, thou canst boast, Bethink thee for what purpose they were giv'n; Nor loiter here: time's ever on the wing! Yet should thy panting bosom rest require, Let what thine eye behold'st lead thee to Heav'n! This Seat, thy wearied body that supports, Once tower'd majestic, the dark forest's pride; It was the raven's cradle, rock'd by storms, Where oft they tasted aldermanic bliss, And caw'd, delighted, o'er an unfledg'd brood; While many an humbler tree, and fragrant shrub, And tender flow'r, emblem of innocence, Its thick-wov'n branches shelter'd from the blast. Oft too, the hind, to shun the fervid glow Of Summer's noon-tide sun, has sought its shade; Pleas'd with wild warblings from its topmost boughs, While o'er his scanty meal, in peace reclin'd, He envy'd no one. Now, time-rent, and fall'n, Lo! its decay bespeaks the fate of man, Fair lord of the creation, frail and vain! If pensive grown, thou hang'st a musing head, One moment's thought points out thy kindred earth; And faded leaves that quiv'ring float around, Soon, soon may rustle o'er thy narrow home! Now deign to view yon cottage in the vale, Where late content beam'd in each ruddy face; See'st thou the ruins?âMark a helpless pair, Who sit, and mourn, and tell to passers by, How war hath blasted all their hopes of age, In sons, who fought, and fell in foreign fields. One hope they have, the hope that virtue gives, It leaves the poor man never: Heav'n's reward, To suff'ring mortals, in this vale of tears. If thy young heart hath not yet felt a pang, For those thy brethren, whose distress bespeaks Thy country's ruin, in its growing pride, Go! âLearn the luxury of doing good;â But, if unmindful of a better world, The phantom pleasure thou hast long pursu'd; And self predominates o'er others' wrongs, Hence, sluggard!âKnow thou art not welcome here! STANZAS WRITTEN IN AUTUMN, 1799. âNow Autumn hath reviv'd the farmer's hope, And the rich gifts of Ceres ting'd with gold; Pleas'd with the bounteous gift, Each field he views.â Anon. Summer's verdure now is fled; Faded are her fragrant flow'rs; Savage Autumn strips the bow'rs, While dull nature hangs her head. Songs of joy no more are heard Thro' the winding valley float, Save the redbreast's grateful note, Fond, domestic, pleasing bird! Yet, ere chilling snows decend, He must quit each well-known wood; And to hamlets driv'n for food, Ask of faithless man a friend. Where, beneath the blooming thorn, Blithe, the milk-maid with her pail, Listen'd to the rustic's tale, Softly told at early morn, Fallen leaves now with'ring lie; Faded moralists, that teach Mortals much; tho' void of speech, For, like them, soon all must die! Deadly blasts now loudly blow, Telling haggard Winter near; Whose approach what millions fear, Sunk by poverty and woe! Oh! that pleasure's sparkling train, Wou'd their false-nam'd joys forbear! And the gifts of Heaven share, With each child of want and pain! Reckless then of fortune's frown, Man his loud complaints might cease: Life would be a vale of peace, Happy state, ah! little known! THE AUTHOR'S WILL. Great Bards, in all ages, all countries, we find, Whose works now delight and enlighten mankind, Were scorn'd by dame fortune, and ofttimes despis'd; When the foes of each country by monarch's were priz'd. The prince of all Poets, old Homer, was poor, And his ballads, unequall'd, would sing at each door; Who the sigh can suppress, that the works ere peruse, Of Cervantes, who wretched, the world cou'd amuse? And while Albion the fate of her Dryden still mourns, Old Scotia may blush o'er the tomb of poor Burns. If distress mark'd the favourite sons of the Nine, Let not scribblers like me at the world e'er repine; But be thankful for favours we ne'er can repay, And smile at life's ills that must soon fade away. O spare a poor rhymer, ye friends ever dear, Nor be to the man or his lays too severe; Dear brethren! to whom all his failings are known, Rail not at his foibles, but heed well your own: For, if pleasure's bowl he was anxious to seize, Remember his mottoââStill willing to please!â An itch after scribbling was long his delight, And if virtue dictated, you'll own he did right: Spider-like, if he spun his weak cobwebs in vain, And the verse gave not pleasure, it seldom gave pain. Since life's an uncertainty, for relaxation, He gladly wou'd cancel each light obligation; For dunces, like princes, an hour cannot reckon, But both must obey, when death pleases to beckon: That leveller alike heeds the one's harmless rhymes, And the other's dominions, his pow'r and his crimes. First.âA fond father's Portrait, I leave to that friend, Who to th' wants of his parents will swear to attend; With a Stick, the firm pledge of my father's affection, On which I oft muse with a pleasing reflection, May he use it, when age bids his body decline, And the son makes his parent as happy as mine! Next, my Flute, that on Eden's green banks I oft play' To amuse a dear friend, or a fair artless maid, Whose wild notes have sooth'd me, and check'd many a sigh, When on follies reflecting, a tear dimm'd my eye, I leave to ?, a youth to my mind; A gift of esteem, to the friend of mankind: May its tones afford pleasure, and shield him from strife, And virtue and harmony guide him thro' life! All my M S. trifles I freely bequeath, To Crito, for whom oft the Muse forms a wreath: If I'm void of invention, or poetic spirit, The touch of my friend changes nonsense to merit; And as he from the censure of sland'rers can save me, I leave him the neat Silver Pen, ? gave me, With this simple request, that, with it, when I'm gone, He the simple inscription will write for my stone; Not forgetting to warn young and old, passing by, To repent of their sins, and make ready to die. 'Tis my pray'r he may long by the Muse be inspir'd, Whose name will be honour'd, while merit's admir'd; For no arts but his own have promoted his fame, Nor a verse has he written that virtue can blame. My Selection of Songs I bequeath to F. J?e, Some the musings of genius, some ravings of folly; He may print them, or burn them, as best it will suit him, Ev'n call mine his own, if he does, few will doubt him. To Miss ?, the best female I know, Whose friendship beguiles the pain'd bosom of woe, If she'll deign to accept, every Picture and Hook; I bequeath, with my Music by Thomson or Hook; A Portfolio of Fragments, and Letters, poor treasure, Strange mixture of nonsense, love, friendship, and pleasure: With some she may rub off the rust of dull care, In others view passions that lead to despair. From the best, to the vainest, we scribblers may change, 'Tis the license of folly, with freedom to range; To Miss ?, I leave, nor hope she'll refuse them, A Volume of Words, with directions to use them: The whole by Sam Johnson, who form'd the great rules, That preserve common sense, spite of women and fools. To Carlyle, whose friendship's a treasure to me, I leave this warm wish, he long happy may be, With him, oft at twilight in Summer I've stray'd, And heard the last song of the thrush in the glade, While charm'd with the landscapes, to him ever dear, Whose pencil pourtray'd every change of the year; Or trac'd nature's beauties, as homeward we trod, Whose scenes, ever varied, the mind leads to God. With him, I in Winter have shar'd each delight, That pleasure cou'd yield, and beguile the long night; Now musing o'er authors, each sense to improve; Now piping soft airs, dear to friendship and love. May the Muse ne'er forsake him, is still my fond pray'r, Nor his face e'er be furrow'd with wrinkles of care! Dull rhymers, unletter'd, who try ev'ry art, To touch a weak head, or an unfeeling heart, Who fain up the heights of Parnassus would hobble, Like me, paid with sneers and contempt for your trouble; I leave you this wish, ne'er to scribble in vain, Rather labour, in time, useful knowledge to gain. To ?, my companion in rambles nocturnal, I leave, just by way of memento, my Journal; And beg he'll not fail the contents to peruse, Whether serious reflections, or scraps from the Muse: By the first, he his own imperfections may see, By the last, he may pity a rhymer, like me. I leave ? my Spectacles, thro' which he'll view His magnified foibles; wou'd mine were as few! So gentle's his heart, ev'n a child may deceive him; So true is his tongue, ev'n his foes may believe him: His greatest fault is, goodness keeps him in fetters, And he lives an example to slaves call'd his betters. I leave to ? a Locket, with Hair, Cut off ere my temples where shorn by dull care: May she wear this small Pledge of fond love near her heart, Till summon'd at length from her friends to depart! My Clothing, thread-bare, I bequeat to the poor, Who, comfortless, many keen ills must endure; And if on life's journey their troubles increase, May hope lead their minds to the mansion of peace! Now, to God the Creator, thro' whom draw breath, Thro' whose promise the sinner may triumph o'er death, I bequeath my poor Soul, and his mercy I crave, For reflection wounds deep, as we bend to the grave! And its Case, which none e'er thought the finest of forms, I leave, a spare feast to its kindred, the worms. My harp, tuneless grown, I now hang on the willow; And in peace with the world, hope for rest on my pillow. Sign'd, truly, October, the twenty sixth day, In the year of our Lord, Eighteen Hundred, R.A SCENE FROM THE MUSICAL FARCE OF âTHE BEGGAR GIRL.â SceneâA Wood. TimeâNight. COL. MORDAUNT. Now roars the tempest hoarse, and heavy rains Swell the harsh-sounding rills; while ev'ry blast Shakes the proud oak, that on the mountain's height, Reigns monarch of the woods. The humble shrub, Safe in the shelter'd vale, feels not its rage! Thus, are some minds on fortune's summit plac'd, Toss'd by rude storms the peasant hears unmov'd. I'll to the inn, and rest.âRest, did I say? Alas! by grief o'ercome, 'tis now some days, Since balmy sleep invited to my pillow. O, life! what art thou?âBut a load of sorrow; That man, weak reptile, shrinking still must bear! Must bear? (Pauses for some moments) Not so! (Draws a pistol in despair) This, this can end my woes! âMy wife, the sweetest flow'r that ever bloom'd, A prey to th' worms!âHer father's crueltyâ The thought is hell!âMy daughter!âBut no more! My heart-strings burst, and frenzy heats my brain; O, how it burns! it burns!âNow, now we meet, No more to part! (Presents the pistol to his head. Enter Capt. Cleveland, who quickly seizes his arm; Mordaunt throws away the pistol.) CAPT. CLEVELAND. Dear friend! dear, but rash Mordaunt! MORDAUNT. What! Cleveland's voice? again, thank Heav'n, I'm well! O I had like t' have done the fatal deedâ Poor thoughtless, frantic wretch! CLEVELAND. Do be composed. Good Mordaunt list to meâ MORDAUNT. How near I stood The dreadful precipice of endless ruin; And tremble yet.âWhat! scorn th' Almighty's pow'r! And dare him to the conflict! How my mind Sinks at the bare rememb'rance; and cold damps Hang on my weakened body. I could weep And welcome death, for life is reft of joys: But time may bring repentance. (Kneels) O most high! A trembling sinner bends to thee for mercy. Grant, thou, whate'er my suff'rings in this world, That christian fortitude may ne'er forsake me; But still may I prepare for that to come! (Rises) O Cleveland! what a change! Religion pours Her healing balm of comfort o'er my mind, And come what will, I'll wait death's friendly blow! CLEVELAND. How fortunate am I, thus, from the grave, To snatch a brother; brave and merciful: Whose deeds in foreign climes, long, long will liveâ Who at the peril of his life, sav'd mine! MORDAUNT. Cleveland, if thou'rt a friend, name that no more. CLEVELAND. Hearing you had left the inn, I trac'd you To this lone spot. Forever will this hour The happiest seem, of all my happy days. MORDAUNT. Cleveland, may Heav'n long guard thee, my preserver! Let me again embrace thee. We'll to th' inn. My spirits, quite exhausted, lack repose. ODE TO FORTUNE. Thy favours, Fortune, I ne'er court, Nor with thy vot'ries much resort; But, didst thou bid me chuse a state, Not meanly poor, nor prineely great, Place me far from the sound of war, And all the wranglings of the bar; Yet nearer to the village spire, Than to his lordship, or the 'squire. Three miles from town, be my retreat, A pleasant cottage, small, but neat, That, to the stranger wand'ring near, Wou'd seem to say, content dwells here. Let gadding woodbines round it creep, And in each lattice fondly peep; A garden, too, its front adorn, Hedg'd careless round; beneath a thorn, A shade, wherein to muse at ease, And watch the labours of my bees; Or study o'er each golden rule, Of those well known in wisdom's school; Or here, when eve bids labour rest, Pipe, to delight some village guest. No artful walks I'd wish to view, For nature ne'er to art shou'd bow; But when the rival pair unite, Where is the breast they can't delight? Thus be the front. And now behind, A wood shou'd check the wild north wind; And shelter safe a warbling throng, Whose rent shou'd be a chearful song. What joy to hear my tenants, free, Hymn grateful notes, from tree to tree! No sportsman rude (ah! cruel joy!) Shou'd e'er the harmless race destroy; Nor truant school-boy e'er shou'd tear From them the young and tender care: Then, oh! mid' Winter's dreary reign, Wou'd they to visit me but deign, I to their wants wou'd still attend, Proud to become each creature's friend. Next, give me, for a maid or wife, A nut-brown girl, sworn foe to strife; One simple in her dress and air, Unus'd to town, or costly fare: Who'd cleanly cook my humble meal, Nor blab the secrets I'd reveal; Who'd sing without conceit or pain; Who'd read the news and bible plain; Who'd write her thoughts in easy prose, And argue well in virtue's cause. My wishes, Fortune, would'st thou crown, The sweets of friendship let me own: One friend I'd ask, of soul sincere, Not moving in too high a sphere; Who'd bend to no proud party knave; A foe to none, to none a slave; Who'd scorn by trifles to be bought, Content in honest home-spun coat. When Winter reign'd in furious rage, We'd mark the follies of the age: Thus converse wou'd each mind illume, For friendship cheers wild Winter's gloom. In Summer, nature's laws we'd scan, Admiring still her beauteous plan; And oft, by some hoarse-murm'ring stream, Indulge a fond poetic dream; Or range, with health, the daisied mead, Then wou'd this life be life indeed! Thus, Fortune, seated to my mind, I'd thank thee oft, and own thee kind. Secure from folly's tiresome noise, Where pleasure health and wealth destroys, Shou'd care or spleen a visit pay, I'd bid them call another day; And chearfully survey the past, Nor think time mov'd too slow or fast; Nor wish to live, nor fear to die, But sink to earth, without a sigh. With such a friend, a wife, and cot, Who wou'd repine, deserves them not; And he who vainly wishes more, May he, like me, thro' life be poor! STANZAS WRITTEN ON THE BANKS OF EDEN, NEAR CARLISLE; WHERE A FAVOURITE GROVE HAD BEEN CUT DOWN. âThere's not one shrub, or flow'r, But tells some dear-lov'd tale to me; Or paints some happy hour, That I, alas! no more shall see!â Miss Blamire. This spot I dearly lov'd to see! 'Twas childhood's paradise to me; And more than thrice ten times the sun His annual course hath run, Since first this bank, crown'd by a wood, I saw reflected in the flood; And mark'd the early shelter'd primrose spring: Then tore it from its mossy seat, And sought the town, with nimble feet, More proud than any king. This spot I dearly lov'd to see, Where warbling songsters wanton'd free! And fancy oft hath drawn the scene, The lawn, and meadows green; The distant hamlet, darken'd glenâ Ev'n midst the noisy haunts of men, When manhood's seasons wing'd with pleasure flew, The hazle copse, where oft the nest I prying sought with panting breast, Were ever in my view! This spot I dearly lov'd to see, When from youth's daily labour free! Here would I trace on many a page, The follies of the age: Or fondly listen friendship's voice; Or deem my fair a matchless choice; But dreamt not love and friendship soon decay: A heartless pilgrim, now, I mourn The joys long fled, ne'er to return, And sigh the hours away! This spot I dearly lov'd to see, Where lovers' names grew on each tree! Ah! Infancy, thy scenes are dear, And call forth many a tear! Fall'n are the trees that form'd a shade, Where oft contemplative I stray'd; Or tun'd my pipe to strains of mirth and love. The stately oak, the humble flow'r, That bloom and perish in an hour, Man's short existence prove! A CHARACTER. âTruth ought ever to pass free as the air we breathe!â Near Lagan's banks, a mile from town, A rural whiten'd cottage stands; The hamlets, halls, and hills of Down, And many a prospect it commands: It fronts the road, where haughty pride And honest poverty throng by; But few they are who turn aside, On this lone cot to cast an eye. Yet, it contains a matchless form, As youthful fancy ever drew; And in that form a heart as warm, As meek philanthropist e'er knew: And it contains as fair a face, As ever fore'd a sigh from man; Each winning smile, each witching grace Are center'd all in Marianne. Yet beauty is a short-liv'd flow'r, Ev'n when in dazzling tints array'd; It blossoms, withers, in an hour, But mental beauties never fade: Think, thus, ye fair in giddy youth, Who whirl o'er fashion's gilded round; Leave not to time to tell this truth, Too late, in age, it oft is found. She who in this low cot resides, To pride, to beauty, wisely blind, The follies of her sex derides, But gladly wou'd improve each mind: Now turning ânature's volume o'er;â Now shunning sanguinary man; Now culling, weighing useful lore; Thus pass the days of Marianne. When Spring dissolves stern Winter's chain, And vegetation ventures forth, She marks the flow'rets on the plain, Just emblems of her modest worth: When health, her guide, in Summer leads To some sequester'd cool alcove, The rising produce of the meads Points to that Pow'r, who reigns above. When Autumn's sheaves, and saffron'd leaves Again tell angry Winter near, By study, she the gloom deceives, Or converse sweet, with friends sincere: Still proving, that from virtue spring The greatest pleasures known to manâ Long may each changing season bring Health, joy, and peace to Marianne! AN ADDRESS SPOKEN BY MR. GRANT, IN CARLISLE, FOR THE BENEFIT OF MRS. JOHNSON, AND HER NUMEROUS FAMILY. âTrue generosity rises above the ordinary rule of social conduct, and flows with much too full a stream to be comprehended within the precise marks of formal precepts. It is a vigorous principle in the soul, which opens and expands all her virtues, far beyond those which are only the forced and unnatural productions of a timid obedience.â Melmoth. Enough of war! and all his hell-born train; Britannia rides triumphant o'er the main; And when sweet peace her olive branch displays, Then, as in war, she gains all Europe's praise: For all the glories conquest e'er could dart, Are trifles, balanc'd with the feeling heart; And all the honours wealth cou'd e'er bestow, Proves that proud man is but the child of woe. Is there, this night, a heart that cannot feel? To such, the Muse, indignant, scorns t' appeal; But ye who scorn the pride of giving pain, Nor sufl'ring mortals treat with cold disdain, But soothe distress, and dry affliction's tear, Rejoic'd I feel, to bid you welcome here: And ye who know the widow'd parent's cares, And all the pangs that oft her bosom tears; The anxious watchings o'er an infant race, An image still in memory to trace; Ye fairest works of nature, who possess The pow'r to succour, and to shield distress, Fair advocates in sacred virtue's causeâ Denied to speak the gratitude she owes, A sister bids me pay the tribute due; And tell the sympathy she found in you. Cherish'd in tender youth, like some fair flow'r, Hope brighten'd with her prospect, ev'ry hour; But cold neglect to damp each joy soon strove, And she was criminal, who dar'd to love. Deserted, virtue still approv'd her choice, And you'll acquit her with a friendly voice. If doom'd to wander from her native home, And with the sons of indigence to roam, A patron in the public, pleas'd she found, And oft her efforts were with plenty crown'd; While love's dear transports lull'd each care to rest, And mutual fondness made a couple blest; But gone is he, her soul's lov'd lord, by fate Summon'd to pass eternity's dark gate. Receive, blest shade! this tribute due to worth; Tho' now remembrance calls fresh sorrows forth: If will to serve, and art to please mankind, If feeling heart, and independent mind, If harmless mirth that oft pure friendship gain'd, While in the bosom love of truth still reign'd, Cou'd turn aside the fatal stroke of death, Thou, friend lamented, would have yet drawn breath! For envy ev'n thy character approv'd; Nor pin'd to hear how much thou wert belov'd. Ye brethren, Free Masons. by mysterious laws combin'd; In vain weak man to many a virtue blind, May spurn at that by greatest mortals giv'n, The noblest Institution, under Heav'n. O! may no rude antipathies remove What social beings owe to social love! For now when wisdom boasts th' enlighten'd age, And truth and reason beam on many a page, No Bard too loud th' inspiring song can raise, That gives your more than matchless deeds due praise. How proud I see you in support of those, Too young to speak, or know ev'n friends from foesâ Illumin'd few, whose bounty thousands share; And you, whose eyes shed pity's dews, ye fair, The helpless offspring will while life endures, Beg for each blessing upon you and yours. ROBESPIERE'S LAMENT. This sanguinary despot, condemned by the world as the most inhuman being that hath yet appeared on this quarter of the globe, was publicly denounced in the Convention, July 26th, 1794. On the following day, he was guillotined, with his numerous and remorseless party, amidst universal execration. SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN THE NIGHT BEFORE HIS EXECUTION. Alas! and am I then undone? Life's mad career will soon be run; For ere to-morrow's setting sun, This throbbing pulse must cease. My country's scourge!âmy country's shame! Justice, arous'd, my life doth claimâ Ages unborn shall curse his name, Who dares not hope for peace! Ambition's woe-devoted slave, Foe to the virtuous and the brave; I sink unpitied to the grave, And shrink at death's dark gloom. Ye tyrants of each distant state, Ah! tremble, when you hear my fate! Lest justice that doth me await, Should bring you to the tomb! In vain this guilty soul would rest; Pangs, worse than Hell, disturb my breast! I hear torn Gallia's sons, oppress'd, Vent curses on my head: I see each murder'd patriot stand, Array'd in blood by my command; While banish'd from their native land, What thousands beg for bread! Earth holds not such a wretch as I! From guilt where can the villain fly, Who must not live, who fears to die? âAvenging fiends I see! Thou Pow'r, whom oft I mock'd with scorn, Tho' by foul crimes this bosom's torn, O hear a helpless sinner mourn! Who, trembling, bends to thee! LINES ON SEEING A BOY TORTURE AN INSECT. âSweet mercy is the loveliest flow'r, That Heav'n e'er planted in the mind; The queen of virtues, whose soft pow'r Can ev'n to godhead raise mankind!â Reed. O spare that insect, thoughtless boy! Let weakness still thy pity claim: Delight to save, but ne'er destroy, So shall compassion bless thy name. The Pow'r who life to thee bestow'd, The smallest creature bids to live; Then dare not to offend thy God! In youth, or age, we praise shou'd give. Seek not to break great nature's chain, Each link of which is fair to view; Nought on the earth is form'd in vainâ O think in time this lesson true! Then spare that insect, puny boy! Weak reptile, to thy parents giv'n! Delight to save, but ne'er destroyâ So hope may lead thy soul to Heav'n! TO MY FLUTE. âOh! surely melody from heav'n was sent, To cheer the soul, when tir'd of human strife; To soothe the wayward heart by sorrow rent, And soften down the rugged road of life.â H. K. White. Hail! thou soft soother of my woes, Friend to delight, and calm repose! With thee, my happiest hours are spent, Free from dull care, and discontent; Unknown to folly's giddy train, Whose revelry's the source of pain. If absent from the friend sincere, Or her this bosom still holds dear; If by feign'd love, false friendship cross'd; If by misfortune tempest toss'd; Tho' hope her flattering aid denies, With thee, soon sorrow from me flies. The martial trumpet sounds to arms, And tells of battle's dire alarms; To fancy's ear, it echoes plain, Of towns destroy'd, of brothers slain: But thine are notes of peace and love, Soft as the warblings of the grove. Hail, pleasing Pipe! by man design'd To ease, to harmonize the mind: With joy, I turn to youth's gay hour, When first I felt thy soothing pow'r; And oft when toss'd on life's rough sea, Thy sounds are dearest then to me! 1804 DECEMBER, A FRAGMENT. On the banks of the river no wild flow'rs are springing All bare is the meadow, and naked the wood; On the spray not a minstrel at eve is heard singing, And silence now reigns, save the sound of the flood: But dearer art thou, in thy wild robes, December, Than Spring deck'd in flow'rs, or gay Summer to me; These tell but of joys that too well I remember, But Winter's approach points to what I must be! Obscur'd by dark clouds, Sol no longer is cheering, And wild o'er the mountains the northern winds blow; The mist on the hills the whole day is appearing, And languishing nature is half-hid with snow: Yet dearer art thou, &amp;c. Where, where are the friendships I shar'd in life's morning, When hope whisper'd oft, they would never decay? Alas! ne'er again can I hope their returning; Like dreams of the night, they have faded away! Thus, dearer art thou, &amp;c. The bright orb of day wakes me no more to gladness; Life's once-pleasing cup is now drain'd of its joy; I rise but to weep, and recline but in sadness, While thoughts of the past ever force a deep sigh: Then dearer art thou, &amp;c. Few pleasures from light-footed mirth can we borrow, Save such as still sober reflection must scorn; By hope long deserted, the mind sunk in sorrow, Regardless of pleasure, courts not her return: And dearer art thou, in thy wild robes, December, Than Spring deck'd in flow'rs, or gay Summer to me; These tell but of joys that too well I remember, But Winter's approach points to what I must be! FRAGMENT. From Corby's hills, or scented groves, O'er hanging woods, I lov'd to view The village steeple point to Heav'n, And mark'd the antient spreading yew; Where all around, Each narrow mound, Gives to vain man a lesson true. Departed spirits seem'd to say, âWeak pilgrim in this vale of woe, Like us, thou'rt hast'ning to the tomb; In time all dear-bought joys forego! The world of strife, The toils of life, Will health destroy, and lay thee low!â Yes, I have paus'd on that lov'd spot, And wept, and thought of follies fled; And wish'd when life's career was run, I there might rest my wearied head: Where one short verse Would truth rehearse, In nervous language from the dead. Now sighing, distant, I exclaim, Adieu, ye minstrel-haunted bow'rs! No more contemplative I range, Where you beguil'd my early hours: No more I find What charms the mindâ O'er me a threat'ning tempest low'rs! Dear chequer'd landscapes, rural scenes, Where Eden winds his devious way! Shall I, no more by fortune cross'd, With heart enraptur'd own your sway? I weep the past, And shrink aghast At ills that threaten life's decay! Whoe'er thou art, excuse the Bard, Who long has strove, in homely strain, To lead the mind o'er virtue's path, But ne'er would cause a mortal pain: His faults forgive. âLearn how to live; If heav'nly joys thou hop'st to gain! FRAGMENT, WRITTEN EXTEMPORE. Nought is there in this wide world worth enjoying, Except health, liberty, and peace of mind; Yet, strange, a thousand vain desires torment us, And overthrow the hopes of happiness. First, pride, a dang'rous inmate of the breast, Her various gew-gaws holds to youth's fond view, And lures the thoughtless mind from wisdom's path: Soon smart correction calls reflection forth, And learning thus becomes a pleasing toil. Now love the heart bewilders; one warm glance From fancied beauty, e'en the blooming cheek, The vermeil lip, arch look of roving eye, The bosom fires, and makes us sigh and pine; Then sleepless pass the health-consuming nights, Nor pleasures now beguile the tedious days; Racks, tortures, pleasing hopes, and jealous fears, Alternate seize the heated wav'ring mind; Till reason claims her empire o'er the brain, And strips a mistress of ideal charms. Ambition next appears, with motley train, And oft in vades our slumbers; now we dream Of grandeur, pomp, and pow'r, of laurels won; And honours lavish'd: soon the tell-tale, time, Grave lessons whispers, proving all our youth But scenes of vanity. In manhood, next, Cautious we reason, pleasures we pursue; And for a while are toss'd 'twixt joy and grief, Till death, oft welcome, ends our countless cares! LINES, ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY, FOND OF SINGING. Sweet is the screech-owl's harshest note, Compar'd with murm'rings from thy throat; Grimalkin's voice seems music quite, That breaks the silence of the night; The prowling wolf that chides the moon, Yells not a more discordant tune; The croaking of the toad is sweet, Compar'd with what thou think'st a treat; Yes, with more pleasure, I could hear The growling of a hungry bear, And sooner far the brute would be, Than forc'd to sit and listen thee! Carlisle. A LESSON TO YOUTH. Tho' Youth thy path be strewn with flow'rs, And mirth leads on the rosy hours; Soon manhood proves the past a dream, And joys, once priz'd, now sorrows seem. O Youth! beware of pleasure's wile! For danger lurks beneath her smile: 'Tis wise, in time, her haunts to shun; Who woos the nymph, is soon undone! Be to a brother's foibles blind; Promote whatever serves mankind; The naked clotheâthe hungry feedâ And bow to what's by Heav'n decreed! Let reason ruleâeach joy despise, That honour, wealth, and health destroys: Let virtue all thy thoughts engage; Then, fearless, may'st thou welcome age! Carnmoney. LINES TO A REDBREAST. Wee namesake! I hae known thee lang, And listen'd aft thy dulcet sang, Far frae thy woodland shade; When Boreas, wi' his gloomy train, Spread desolation o'er the plain, Poor houseless flutt'rer! ne'er in vain, Didst thou implore my aid. Thy fate and mine are e'vn the same; Unheeded pair, unknown to fame, We sing the hours away: Yet, Robin, thou canst taste repose, In spite o' thy rapacious foes; While reas'ning man, subdu'd by woes, To grief aft fa's a prey. Come cheerfu' bird, my cottage share! Ay welcome to my hamely fare, Till Spring decks ilka tree; Then wilt thou wanton on the wing, Or on some ivy'd turret sing; But, O! nae season's change can bring A season's joys to me! STANZAS, ON RECEIVING A PRESENT FROM ONE LONG AND TRULY ESTEEMED. Yes, on it I will gaze, and sigh, And next my heart the prize will wear, Ev'n death's keen terrors I'd defy, Ere man from me the gift shou'd tear! An exile tho' I'm doom'd to stray; Where'er my vagrant feet may rove, I'll kiss it, with a tear, and say, O had it been the gift of love! But love, alas! has brought me low, And none from ruin can me save; 'Tis mine to bear a load of woe, Till sorrow sinks me in the grave. Ah! precious gift! on which I gaze, May thy late owner ne'er endure The pang that on this bosom preys, The pain she proudly scorn'd to cure! If e'er she deign to think of me, May no rude cares disturb her breast! âFor her, my daily pray'r shall be, The fair destroyer of my rest! LINES, WRITTEN IN CARRICKFERGUS JAIL. Many a tyrant, many a slave, Pander, prostitute, and knave, Coward base, and patriot brave, Come trembling here; Genius, idiot, dunce, and wit, Men for this wild world unfit, Sighing, thinking, starving sit And drop a tear. Here, perchance, some noble mind, Amidst the dregs of human kind, Roams states ideal, unconfin'd, In miseryâ Ev'n monarchs of our earthly ball, With princes, prelates at their call, What are they?âWretched pris'ners all! Whom death sets free! A REFLECTION. âMortal joys however pure, Soon their turbid source betray; Mortal bliss, however sure, Soon must totter and decay.â From the Arabic. Estrang'd from all I once held dear, Reflection turns to pleasures past; And pond'ring on life's mad career, At future days I shrink aghast. A secret pang oft rends my breast, Soft pity's tear could not remove; It robs me of night's soothing rest, And days of pain it makes me prove. It made me soon a child of care, And stole from me health's blooming rose; But I this pang must silent bear, Till death the painful scene shall close. Returning seasons charm no more, That erst this bosom fir'd with joy; The smiles of hope can nought restore, And but my fancied joys destroy. I fondly gaze, nor vain my aim, On nature's grand unerring plan; And sighing, inwardly exclaim, Alas! how thoughtless is frail man! The wither'd flow'ret in the shade, To me presents a hast'ning doom;â A few short hours may see me laid Unpitied, in the narrow tomb. In youth we trifle time away, On tempting pleasures, idly vain; In manhood, join a world too gay, And crush the joys we hope to gain. Oh! when my latest hour draws near, Then may I own the moments blest; And, wearied with my wand'rings here, Believe with truth, death's slumber's rest! THE POOR PRUDE. âDecency at all times commands our esteem; but when wretchedness appeareth like the daw in borrowed feathers, the weakness serves only to excite our laughter.â Marmontel. Poor Prude! in vain thou play'st the rake, With borrow'd hair, and tatter'd lace; Nature, who gave thee such a face, Ne'er meant thou shou'd'st one conquest make. Like thee, the noxious tulip blows, In all its gaudy colours drest; But who wou'd place it near his breast, That e'er has seen a blushing rose? Why leer, and frighten half the town? Since mankind beauty can discern, Do, Dowdy, stay at home, and learn To wash thy apron, cap, and gown! But if coquette thou still wilt be, Know, with such features, form, and skin, Decrepid, dirty, dull, and thin, He must be blind who fancies thee! THE ROSE. ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY. O lady, mark that blooming Rose, The fairest flow'r the Sun shines on! To-day, the garden's pride it blows, To-morrow, all its sweets are gone! The fairest emblem of the fair To blighting storms must fall a prey; And tho' of joys thou hast thy share, Thy prime is but a Summer day! And mark that roving artful bee, The gaudy type of villain man; Alas! what flutt'ring crowds we see With wily snares thy sex trepan! Robb'd of its sweets, the matchless flow'r Soon withers, droops, and faded lies; Thus, won by love's deceitful lure, The thoughtless beauty pines, and dies! TO THE LARK. Sweet is thy carol, soaring Lark! Rejoicing nature bids thee sing; Thy eager flight I fondly mark, Blithe messenger of welcome Spring: Thou call'st me from yon noisy throng, Where endless cares disturb the mind, And list'ning to thy cheerful song, I shun the temptings of mankind. Lone monitor! when Sol's bright ray Illumes the gently sloping hill, And meditation guides my way, Along some unfrequented rill; Thy upward flight points to that Pow'r, Whose goodness will for ever last: Then let me wisely spend this hour, And muse on many idly past. STANZAS WRITTEN IN AN HOUR OF DESPONDENCY. Adieu, ye gay delights of youth, Vain pride, lewd mirth, and painful love! Henceforth be mine the sweets of truth And innocence to prove. On youth what anxibus pleasures wait, And daily tempt his wand'ring eye, At which he grasps; but, oft too late, He sees fell ruin nigh! The days are fled, the joys are past, Dear joys, that I was wont to prize! I bend before misfortune's blast, And hope within me dies. No more by contemplation led, Can nature's fairest scenes delight! No more is fancy's net-work spread Before my aching sight! Nor aught avail the varied hues That from the lap of Summer flow, To him who, in the future, views Variety of woe! But dear are Winter's raging winds, His forests bare, and frowning sky; Congenial to the wearied minds Of creatures, such as I. Yon tree, unshelter'd from the storm, Hangs, tott'ring o'er the dimpl'd stream, By wild winds torn: its shapeless form Now tells me what I seem! TO YOUTH. Ah! Youth, how soon thy joys are flown! The fond delights we scarcely own, Ere sorrow dims each prospect fair; And days and years are mark'd by care. A while we wander to and fro, 'Twixt fancied joy and real woe; The glare of pomp we idly prize, While gay content far from us flies. When hope her aid denies, at last Reflection points to what is past; And whispers oft, tho' oft in vain, That pleasure's but the source of pain. EPITAPH ON DAVID BIGGER, ESQ. Affection tender rears this humble stone, A mould'ring mark of gratitude, to one Whose thoughts ambition never taught to stray, Nor own'd unlawful pleasure's dang'rous sway. The love of country warm'd his feeling breast; And proud was he to succour the distress'd: Cheerful, resign'd, life's peaceful vale he trod, And rested on the mercy of his God. Go, reader, and when in earth's silent womb, May truth give such a tribute at thy tomb! EPITAPH ON THE FATHER OF A FRIEND. Take, best of parents, all a son can give To one, who living, taught him how to live; And, O may I, when number'd with the dead, Deserve the praise that marks thy earthy bed! âYe, who the good man's name must still revere, Know, that a virtuous brother's buried here: Who envied none, pleas'd in his calm retreat; And prov'd, tho' little known, man may be great. EPITAPH ON MARIA OF THE COTTAGE. Reader, if worth departed claims a tear, Life's poor frail wand'rer, pay that tribute here, To one, in whom as daughter, sister, wife, Was shewn affection thro' a well-spent life; Who early learn'd to share another's woe, And knew from whence all lasting pleasures flow: A thirst for knowledge prov'd her virtue's care, And 'midst her suff'rings, ne'er did she despair. With feeling heart, pure friendship, love of truth, She shar'd alike th' esteem of age and youth; With genius bless'd, and independent mind, 'Twas her's to study, and instruct mankind: She liv'd in meek-ey'd pity's robe array'd, And gain'd a laurel, time can never fade! Now, if in virtue's path thou dost not tread, O! take this lesson from the silent dead! From folly fly, and to religion turn; For soon will life's short taper cease to burn! EPITAPH ON AKEL BULBEE, WRITTEN BY SATIRICUS TERTULIBUS, POET LAUREAT TO HUMPHA GRUMPHA, DEY OF ALGIERS. Translated by Geofrey Bellwedder, Esq. X. G. Y. S. Q. Here bleach the bones of Akel Bulbee, Such a thief ne'er hung on a gallows tree: His carcase was food for the carrion crows, And ne'er may a grave such a being enclose! He was sent as a curse to St. Mary's Knowe, For at midnight he milk'd ev'ry neighbour's cow; Gold, pigs, cloth, sheep, geese, ducks, and meal, All things (save the clouds o'er his head) he cou'd steal. Fools say, just to keep all around him in awe, He daily wou'd steal what he ne'er once saw; That had he been size to have reach'd the moon, By the horns he wou'd quickly have pull'd her down; That imps swore, he never with them shou'd dwell, Lest soon he might steal their old master from Hell; That he stole a calf from a heifer's womb; And whistl'd a corpse from the silent tomb: That timber he stole long ere it grewâ The last must be false. Give the Devil his due! Such a liar ne'er liv'd, for he swore in youth, No law shou'd e'er bind him to tell the truth; Such a coxcomb in rags, ne'er strutted on earth, He ne'er had a friend from the day of his birth, For nature then vow'd, he wore a thief's eye; And who dare say nature e'er yet did lie? A Poet he was, spite of all common sense, But had twelve times his share of foul impudence: A fine Musician, his family say, For his tooting oft frighten'd the cows from hay: A Painter, too, he made some suppose, Tho' he never cou'd sketch his own trumpet nose. That so long he liv'd many swore was a shame; Justice trembl'd whenever she heard his name: But his name will live while the world goes round, For a wretch so notorious never trod ground. Mark well the bleach'd bones of Akel Bulbee, Such a thief ne'er hung on a gallows tree: His equal, 'tis said, can only be known, When rivers flow upwards, and trees grow down! SONNETS. WRITTEN ON THE AUTHOR'S BIRTH-DAY FEBRUARY 1st, 1800. With joy, how oft I hail'd my natal morn, When sportive youth enjoy'd his fairy reign; And long'd to mark each infant year's return, Eager to launch into life's troublous main. Ah! happy period, when with heart elate, And partial eye the busy world I view'd; Nor dreamt, while pleasure seem'd on me to wait, My path with sorrow's night-shade would be strew'd! Henceforth, farewell to pleasure's giddy crowd; Ye day-dreams vain, delusive hopes, adieu; By madd'ning passions fir'd, too long I've bow'd A willing slave to vanity and you: For while remembrance pauses on the past, I tremble, lest this day should be my last. TO WILLIAM COWPER, ESQ. ON READING HIS POEM OF âTHE TASK.â First of the deathless few who strike the lyre, To feast, with pure delight, the reas'ning mind, Or strive the source of happiness to find, Cowper, thy verse who reads must needs admire! Tutor'd by virtue, ev'n in glowing youth, With pitying eye thou didst the world survey; Then, saint-like, strove from pleasure's thorny way To draw mankind by many a moral truth. While meaner Bards worship at folly's shrine, And court ambition by each servile verse, Or black oppression's foulest deeds rehearse, Boldly disclaiming truth, in pompous lineâ Thou with the exil'd victim seem'st to mourn, And bid'st the woe-worn wand'rer heav'n wards turn. 1798. TO MARIA OF THE COTTAGE. Daughter of Genius! sweet it is to m Whene'er I fly this vain tumultuous crowd, (Where poorer slaves must bow to wretches proud) Thy cot to seek; and hear thy converse free, In praise of virtuous freedom justly loud; Next argue for thy sex, oft basely bow'd, By tyrant man to keenest misery. Daughter of Truth! this heart-felt wish I send; May sorrow ne'er with thorns bestrew thy way, But health, and hope, and peace thy steps attend; And long the Muses o'er their fav'rite bend; Prompting the legend strong, or sprightly lay! Weak flows my verse; yet will I proud commend A learn'd instructress, and fair virtuous friend. TO MARIA OF THE COTTAGE. You ask, Maria, why I droop my head? And why thus let dejection cloud my brow? Alas! life's various prospects all are fled, Which frolic fancy once before me spread, And nought but misery awaits me now; Too long a captive by false pleasure led, And madd'ning mirth, th' unheeded minutes flew, While projects vain were idly nourished. Lost, too, are friends who vow'd eternal truth; Yes, friendship's balm drives heavy cares away! But little dreams poor unsuspecting youth, Misfortune makes e'en friendship soon decay! âO wonder not, Maria, if my breast Now harbours sorrow, life-consuming guest! TO MRS. HOWARD, OF CORBY CASTLE, ON PRESENTING A VOLUME OF MANUSCRIPT POEMS. If aught of nature in my humble strain, Shall unexpected catch your list'ning ear, Such the reward, I scorn the critic's sneer, Nor greater prize on earth e'er seek to gain! Tho' long compell'd o'er distant lands to roam, In fancy, oft thro' Corby's Bow'rs I range; And taste the sweets that time can ne'er estrange, Where nature smiles around my native home. Each day recalls the scenes of dear delights; The banks, whose shrubs display a thousand dies; The distant landscapes; and the wood-crown'd heights, Where oaks majestic court the liquid skies: Rocks, woods, and lawns, for ever seem t' inspire The glow that fills my bosom with desire! MARY'S ABSENCE. The dazzling light so beauteous in her eye, The tender bloom which plays on Mary's cheek, The neck, that ev'n with mountain snows might vie, The voice, most musical, in accents meek, These snare the soul, these force love's painful sigh; Methinks, to see her look, to hear her speak, Would tempt a hermit from his cell to fly. These wak'd each fond emotion in my heart, But when I heard her pleading pity's cause, I dearly lov'd; nor dreamt we soon would part: Now many a water wide between us flows, I view her grace, her features void of art, In the fair flow'rs gay Spring around me throws; For she is gone, and gone, alas! is my repose. TO MRS. CHARLOTTE SMITH. When infant flow'rs their fragrance breathe around, And each poor flutt'rer wantons on the wing, To fancy's ear how grateful is the sound That hymns the welcome smiles of lovely Spring. But ere wild Autumn strips the hanging bow'r, Some nestless, widow'd bird, is heard repeat Her song of sadness, oft at eve's pale hour, Telling to pathless woods of man's deceit. Such, sorrow's syren, dwell on my rapt ear, Thy plaintive notes that speak of pleasures past; Of joys long fled, and friends no longer dear, How each sad day's embitter'd by the last. For thee, tho' sympathy's soft tear may start, Alas! not pity's balm can heal thy broken heart! 1798. TO EVENING. Hail, sober Eve! to meditation dear; Pure the delight, these well-known scenes to rove; The joys this placid bosom now can prove, Not yon proud city's wealth from me could tear: The warbler's last note twitters thro' the grove, And Caldew's murmurs gently strike the ear. O, were my Mary, virtuous fair but here, Now smiling April woos the month of love! Then rapt in pleasure, we would fondly stray; Nature, chaste love, by turns should be our theme; And oft as Luna lent a silv'ry ray, On Mary's charms to gaze my soul away, Methinks were Heav'n, compar'd with Poet's dream: Then grant me, fate, a while this luxury supreme! ADDRESSED TO THE INFANT SON OF GAELUS, THE BARD OF DUNOVER. Sweet Bud! thy full blue eye, health-blooming cheek, And dimpling smile, how cherub-like to see! Gazing on that wild flow'r, thou fain would'st speak, But dream'st not, Boy, how it resembleth thee. Alike, you're nurtur'd in seclusion's shade; Ev'n as frail man, its reign is quickly o'er; Another hour may see its beauties fade, It blooms its Summer, man enjoys no more. From many a nipping blast, that tender flow'r Ere long, must turn its drooping head aside; So thou, perchance, must fall by ruthless pow'r, Or live to bear the bitter taunts of pride. Long may'st thou tread thy father's steps, sweet Boy! And crown thy parent's closing years with joy! Dunover, July, 1809. TO THE RIVER EDEN. Sweet Stream! when on thy flow'ry banks I stray, Or trace the wild-wood, mead, or fertile vale; And hear the songsters mourn departing day, Or taste at morn the health-bestowing gale, Remembrance paints the change, in every scene, That now delights not, but calls forth a tear: From friends, still priz'd, an exile sad I've beenâ Life's joys are fled, and much have I to fear. Sweet Stream! in fancy oft on thee I gaz'd, When wand'ring with the Muse, in Erin's Isle; And hope, perchance, in vain my spirits rais'd, For hope, alas! oft whispers to beguile. Now, sunk in want, on these lov'd banks I mourn, And think of pleasures that can ne'er return! CUMBERLAND BALLADS. NICHOL THE NEWSMONGER. Tune,ââThe Night before Larry was stretch'd.â Come, Nichol, and gi'e us thy cracks, I seed te gang down to the smiddy; I've fodder'd the naigs and the nowt, And wanted to see thee 'at did e. Ay, Andrew lad! draw in a stuil, And gi'e us a shek o' thy daddle; I got aw the news far and nar, Sae set off as fast's e could waddle. In France they've but sworrowfu' teymes, For Bonnyprat's nit as he sud be; America's nobbet sae sae; And England nit quite as she mud be: Sad wark there's amang blacks and wheytes, Alluding to the insurrection of the blacks.

A weddin we'll hev or it's lang, Wi' Bet Brag and lal Tommy Tagwally; Jack Bunton's for off to the seaâ It'll e'en be the deeth of our Sally; The clogger has bowt a new wig; Dawston singers come here agean Sunday; Lord Nelson's ta'en three Spanish fleets; And the dancin schuil opens on Monday. Carel badgers are monstrous sad fwok, The silly peer de'ils how they wring up! Lal bairns, ha'e got pox frae the kye, Cow-pox. And fact'ries, leyke mushrooms, they spring up: If they sud keep their feet for a wheyle, And goverment nobbet pruive civil, They'll build up as hee as the muin, For Carel's a match for the deevil.

Illumination.

July 31, 1802. TOM LINTON. Tune,ââCome under my plaidie.â Tom Linton was bworn till a brave canny fortune, His auld fadder screap'd aw the gear up he cud; But Tom, country booby, luik'd owre hee abuin him, And mix'd wi' the bad, nor e'er heeded the gud; At the town he'd whore, gammle, play hell, and the deevil, He wad hev his caper, nor car'd how it com; Then he mud hev his greyhounds, guns, setters, and hunter, And king o' the cockers they aw cursen'd Tom. I think I just see how the lads wad flock roun him, And, oh! they were fain to shek Tom by the han! Then he'd tell how he fit wi' the barbers and bullies, And drank wi' the waiter till nowther cud stan: His watch he wad shew, and his list o' the horses, And pou out a guinea, and offer to lay, Till our peer country lads grew uneasy and lazy, And Tom cud ha'e coax'd hawf the parish away. Then he drank wi' the squire, and laugh'd wid his worship, And talk'd o' the duke, and the deevil kens whee; He gat aw the new-fangl'd oaths i' the nation, And mock'd a peer beggar man wantin an ee; His fields they were morgag'd; about it was whisper'd; A farmer was robb'd nit owre far frae his house; At last aw was selt his auld fadder had toil'd for, And silly Tom Linton left nit worth a sous. His fortune aw spent, what! he'd hae the laird's dowter, But she pack'd him off wid a flee in his ear; Neist thing, an auld comrade, for money Tom borrow'd, E'en pat him in prison, and bad him lig theer: At last he gat out, efter lang he had suffer'd, And sair had repented the sad life he'd led: Widout shun till his feet, in a sowdger's auld jacket, He works on the turnpeyke reet hard for his bread. Now folly seen intui, ragg'd, peer, and down-hearted, He toils and he freets, and keen wants daily press; If cronies reyde by, wey, alas! they've forgot him, For whee can remember auld friends in distress? O pity, what pity, that, in ev'ry county, Sae mony Tom Lintons may always be found! Deuce tek aw girt nwotions, and whurligig fashions, Contentment's a kingdom, aye, aw the warl round! August 24, 1802. KITT CRAFFET. Tune,ââCome under my plaidie.â Isaac Crosset, o' Shawk, a feyne heed-sten hes cutten And just setten't up owr anent the kurk en; A chubby-feac'd angel o'top on't they've putten, And varses, as gud as e'er com frae a pen: It's for auld Kit Craffet, our wordy wise neybor, God rest him! a better man ne'er wore a head; He's nit left his fellow thro' aw the heale county, And monie peer fwok are in want, now he's dead. I meynd when at schuil, a reet top scholar was he; Of lakin or rampin nae nwotion had he, But nar the auld thworn he wad sit and keep mwosin, And caw'd it a sin just to kill a peer flee: A penny he never let rest in his pocket, But gev't to the furst beggar body he met; Then at kurk he cud follow the priest thro' the sarvice, And as for a tribble he niver was bet. Tho' he wan seebem belts lang afwore he was twenty, And in Scealeby meedow oft tuik off the baw, Yet he kent aw the beyble, algebra, Josephus, And capp'd the priest, maister, exciseman and aw. He cud talk about battles, balloons, burnin mountains, And wars, till baith young and auld trimmel'd for fear, Then he'd tell how they us'd the âpeer West Indie negers.â And stamp wid his fit, aye, and drop monie a tear. When he read about parliments, pleaces, and changes, He flang by the paper, and cried, âSilly stuff! The Outs wad be in, and the Ins rob their country, They're nit aw together worth ae pinch o' snuff!â His creed wasâBe statesmen but just, Britons loyal, And lang as our shippen reyde maisters at sea, We'll laugh at the puffin o' vain Bonnyparty, As suin may he conquer the deevil as we. Then when onie neybor was fash'd by the turnies, Oh, it meade him happy if he cud be bail! Twea-thurds of his income he gev away yearly, And actually tuik peer Tom Linton frae jail. He was yence cross'd in luive by a guid-for-nought hussey, But if onie lass by her sweetheart was wrang'd, He wad give her guid counsel, and lecture the fellow, And oft did he wish aw sec skeybels were hang'd. He cud mek pills and plaisters as weel as our doctor, And cure cholic, aga, and jaunice forby; As for greece, or the glanders, red watter, or fellen, Nin o' them was leyke him, amang naigs or kye: What, he talk'd to the bishop about agriculture, And yence went to Plymouth to see the grand fleet; As for the brave sailors trail'd off by the press-gangs, âOd die them!â he said, âthat can never be reet!â He ne'er was a drinker, a swearer, a feghter, A cocker, a gamler, a fop, or a fuil; But left this sad warl just at threescwore and seebem, I' the clay house his granfadder built wi' the schuil. Oh! monie a saut tear will be shed ev'ry Sunday, In readin the varses they've stuck on his steane; 'Till watters run up bank, and trees they grow down bank, We never can luik on his marrow agean! January 2, 1807. WATTY. Tune,âBy the Author. If you ax where I come frae, I say the fell seyde, Where fadder and mudder, and honest fwok beyde; And my sweetheart, O bliss her! she thought nin leyke me, For when we shuik hans the tears gush'd frae her ee: Says I, âI mun e'en get a spot if I can, But, whativer beteyde me, I'll think o' thee, Nan!â Nan was a parfet beauty, wi' twee cheeks leyke codlin blossoms: the varra seet on her meade my mouth aw watter. âFares-te-weel, Watty!â says she; âtou's a wag amang t' lasses, and I'll see thee nae mair!ââ âNay, dunnet gowl, Nan! says I, âFor, mappen, er lang, I's be maister mysel;â Sae we buss'd, and I tuik a last luik at the fell. On I whussel'd and wonder'dâmy bundle I flung Owre my shou'der, when Cwoley he efter me sprung, And howl'd, silly fellow! and fawn'd at my fit, As if to say, Watty, we munnet part yet! At Carel I stuid wi' a strae i' my mouth, And they tuik me, nae doubt, for a promisin youth. The weyves com roun me in clusters: âWhat weage dus te ax, canny lad?â says yen. âWey, three pun and a crown; wunnet beate a hair o' my beard.ââ âWhat can te dui?â says anudder. âDui! wey I can pleugh, sow, mow, sheer, thresh, deyke, milk, kurn, muck a byre, sing a psolm, men car-gear, dance a whornpeype, nick a naig's tail, hunt a brock, or feght iver a yen o' my weight in aw Croglin parish.â Auld Margery Jackson suin caw't me her man; But that day, I may say't, aw my sorrows began. Furst, Cwoley, peer fellow! they hang'd i' the street, And skinn'd, God forgi' them! for shun to their feet. I cry'd, and they caw'd me peer hawf-witted clown, And banter'd and follow'd me aw up and down: Neist my deame she e'en starv'd me, that niver liv'd weel; Her hard words and luiks wou'd ha'e freeten'd the deil:â She hed a lang beard, for aw t' warl leyke a billy goat, wi' a kil-dried frosty feace: and then the smawest leg o' mutton in aw Carel market sarrad the cat, me, and hur for a week. The bairns meade sec gam on us, and thunder'd at the rapper, as if to waken a corp: when I open'd the duir, they threw stour i' my een, and caw'd me daft Watty; Sae I pack'd up my duds when my quarter was out, And, wi' weage i' my pocket, I saunter'd about. Suin my reet-han breek pocket thy pick'd in a fray, And wi' fifteen wheyte shillins they slipp'd clean away, Forby my twee letters frae mudder and Nan, Where they said Carel lasses wad Watty trapan: But 'twoud tek a lang day just to tell what I saw, How I sceap'd frae the gallows, the sowdgers and aw. Aa, there were some fworgery chaps bad me just sign my neame. âNay,â says I, âyou've gotten a wrang pig by t' lug, for I canna write.â Then a fellow leyke a lobster, aw leac'd and feather'd, ax'd me, âWatty, wull te list? thou's owther be a general or a gomoral.'ââNay, I wunnetâthat's plain: I's content wi' a cwoat o' mudder's spinnin, â Now, wi' twee groats and tuppence, I'll e'en toddle heame, But ne'er be a sowdger wheyle Watty's my neame. How my mudder 'll gowl, and my fadder 'll stare, When I tell them peer Cwoley they'll niver see mair. Then they'll bring me a stuil;âas for Nan, she'll be fain, When I kiss her, God bliss her, agean and agean! The barn, and the byre, and the auld hollow tree, Will just seem leyke cronies yen's fidgin to see. The sheep 'll nit ken Watty's voice now! The peatstack we us'd to lake roun 'll be brunt ere this! As for Nan, she'll be owther married or broken hearted; but sud aw be weel at Croglin, we'll hae feastin, fiddlin, dancin, drinkin, singin, and smuikin, aye, till aw's blue about us: Amang aw our neybours sec wonders I'll tell, But niver mair leave my auld friens or the fell. January 10, 1803. THE BLECKELL MURRY-NEET. Aa, lad! sec a murry-neet we've hed at Bleckell, The sound o' the fiddle yet rings i' my ear; Aw reet clipt and heel'd were the lads and the lasses, And monie a cliver lish huzzy was theer: The bettermer swort sat snug i' the parlour, I' th' pantry the sweethearters cutter'd sae soft; The dancers they kick'd up a stour i' the kitchen; At lanter the caird-lakers sat i' the loft. The clogger o' Dawston's a famish top hero, And bangs aw the player-fwok twenty to yen; He stamp'd wid his fit, and he shouted and royster'd, Till the sweet it ran off at his varra chin en; Then he held up ae han leyke the spout of a tea-pot, And danc'd cross the buckle, and leather-te-patch; When they cried, âbonny Bell! â he lap up to the ceilin, And ay crack'd his thoums for a bit of a fratch. The Hivverby lads at fair drinkin are seypers; At cockin the Dawstoners niver wer bet; The Buckabank chaps are reet famish sweethearters, Their kisses just soun leyke the sneck of a yeat; The lasses o' Bleckell are sae monie angels; The Cummersdale beauties ay glory in funâ God help the peer fellow that glymes at them dancin, He'll steal away heartless as sure as a gun! The 'bacco was strang, and the yell it was lythey, And monie a yen bottom'd a whart leyke a kurn; Daft Fred', i' the nuik, leyke a hawf-rwoasted deevil, Telt sly smutty stwories, and meade them aw gurn; Then yen sung âTom Linton,â anudder âDick Watters,â The auld farmers bragg'd o' their fillies and fwoals, Wi' jeybin and jwokin, and hotchin and laughin, Till some thought it teyme to set off to the cwoals. But, hod! I forgat-when the clock strack eleebem, The dubbler was brong in, wi' wheyte breed and brown; The gully was sharp, the girt cheese was a topper, And lumps big as lapstons our lads gobbl'd down: Ay the douse dapper lanlady, cried, âEat and welcome! I' God's neame step forret; nay dunnet be bleate!â Our guts aw weel pang'd, we buck'd up for blin Jenny, And neist paid the shot on a girt pewder plate. Now full to the thropple, wi' heed-warks and heartaches, Some crap to the clock-kease instead o' the duir; Then sleepin and snworin tuik pleace o' their rwoarin, And teane abuin tudder e'en laid on the fluir. The last o' December, lang, lang we'll remember, At five i' the mworn, eighteen hundred and twee: Here's health and success to the brave Jwohnny Dawston, And monie sec meetins may we live to see! July 4, 1803 THE VILLAGE GANG. Tune,ââJenny dang the weaver.â There's sec a gang in our town, The deevil cannot wrang them, And cud yen get tem put i' prent, Aw England cuddent bang them: Our dogs e'en beyte aw decent fwok, Our varra naigs they kick them, And if they nobbet ax their way, Our lads set on and lick them. Furst wi' Dick Wiggem we'll begin, The teyney, greasy wobster: He's got a gob frae lug to lug, And neb leyke onie lobster; Dick' weyfe, they say, was Branton bred, Her mudder was a howdey, And when peer Dick's thrang on the luim, She's off to Jwohnnie Gowdey. But as for Jwohnnie, silly man, He threeps about the nation, And talks o' stocks and Charley Fox, And meks a blusteration; He reads the paper yence a week, The auld fwok geape and wonderâ Were Jwohnnie king we'd aw be rich, And France mud e'n knock under. Lang Peel the laird's a dispert chap, His weyfe's a famish fratcherâ She brays the lasses, starves the lads, Nae bandylan can match her: We aw ken how they gat their gear, But that's a fearfu' stwory, And sud he hing on Carel Sands, Nit yen wad e'er be sworry. Beane-breker Jwohn we weel may neame, He's tir'd o' wark, confound him! By manglin limbs and streenin joints, He's meade aw cripples roun him: Mair hurt he's duin than onie yen That iver sceap'd a helter; When sec leyke guffs leame decent fwok, It's teyme some laws sud alter. The schuilmaister's a conjuror, For when our lads are drinkin, Aw macks o' tricks he'll dui wi' cairds, And tell fwok what they're thinkin; He'll glowr at maps and spell hard words, For hours and hours together, And in the muin he kens what's duinâ Nay he can coin the weather! Then theer's the blacksmith wi' ae ee, And his hawf-witted mudder, 'Twad mek a deed man laugh to see Them glyme at yen anudder; A three-quart piggen full o' keale, He'll sup, the greedy sinner, Then eat a cow'd-lword leyke his head, Aye, onie day at dinner. Jack Marr, the hirplin piper's son, Can bang them aw at leein; He'll brek a lock, or steal a cock, Wi' onie yen in bein: He eats guid meat, and drinks strang drink, And gangs weel graith'd o' Sunday, And weel he may, a bonny fray Com out last Whissen-Monday. The doctor he's a parfet pleague, And hawf the parish puzzens; The lawyer sets fwok by the lugs, And cheats them neist by duzzens; The parson swears a bonny stick Amang our sackless asses; The 'squire's ruin'd scwores and scwores O' canny country lasses. Theer's twenty mair, coarse as neck beef, If yen hed teyme to neame them; Left-handed Sim, slape-finger'd Sam, Nae law cud iver teame them; Theer's blue nebb'd Watt, and ewe-chin'd Dick, Weel wordy o' the gallowsâ O happy is the country seyde That's free frae sec leyke fellows! November 27, 1803. LANG SEYNE. Tune,ââJockey's grey breeks.â The last new shun our Betty gat, They pinch her feet, the deil may care! What, she mud ha'e them leady leyke, Tho' she hes cworns, for evermair: Nae black gairn stockins will she wear, They mun be wheyte, and cotton feyne! This meks me think of other teymes, The happy days o' auld lang seyne! Our dowter, tui, a palace Pelisse. bought, A guid reed clwoak she cannot wear; And stays, she says, spoil leady's shepsâ Oh! it wad mek a parson swear! Nit ae han's turn o' wark she'll dui, She'll nowther milk or sarrat sweyneâ The country's puzzen'd roun wi' preyde, For lasses work'd reet hard lang seyne. We've three guid rooms in our clay house, Just big eneugh for sec as we; They'd hev a parlour built wi' bricks, I mud submitâwhat cud I dee? The sattle neist was thrown aside, It meeght ha'e sarra'd me and meyne; My mudder thought it mens'd a houseâ But we think shem o' auld lang seyne! We us'd to ga to bed at dark, And ruse agean at four or five; The mworn's the only teyme for wark, If fwok are hilthy, and wou'd thrive: Now we git up,ânay, God kens when! And nuin's owre suin for us to deyne; I's hungry or the pot's hawf boil'd, And wish for teymes leyke auld lang seyne. Deuce tek the fuil-invented tea! For tweyce a-day we that mun hev; Then taxes git sae monstrous hee, The deil a plack yen now can seave! There's been nae luck throughout the lan, Sin fwok mud leyke their betters sheyne; French fashions mek us parfet fuils; We're caff and san to auld lang seyne! January 5, 1807. CANNY CUMMERLAN. Tune,ââThe humours of Glen.â 'Twas ae neet last week, wid our wark efter supper, We went owre the geate cousin Isbel to see; Theer were Sibby frae Curthet, and lal Betty Byers, Deef Debby, forby Bella Bunton and me; We'd scarce begun spinnin, when Sib a sang lilted, She'd brong her frae Carel by their sarvant man; 'Twas aw about Cummerlan fwok and feyne pleaces, And, if I can think on't, ye's hear how it ran. Yer buik-larn'd wise gentry, that's seen monie counties, May preach and palaver, and brag as they will O' mountains, lakes, valleys, woods, watters, and meadows, But canny auld Cummerlan caps them aw still: It's true, we've nae palaces sheynin amang us, Nor marble tall towers to catch the weak eye; But we've monie feyne cassels, where fit our brave fadders, When Cummerlan cud onie county defy. Furst Graystock we'll nwotish, the seat o' girt Norfolk, A neame still to freemen and Englishmen dear; Ye Cummerlan fwok, may your sons and your gransons Sec rare honest statesmen for iver revere: Corruption's a sink that'll puzzen the country, And lead us to slav'ry, to me it seems plain; But he that hes courage to stem the black torrent, True Britons sud pray for, agean and agean. Whea that hes climb'd Skiddaw, hes seen sec a prospec, Where fells frown owre fells, and in majesty vie? Whea that hes seen Keswick, can count hawf its beauties, May e'en try to count hawf the stars i' the sky: Theer's Ullswater, Bassenthwaite, Wastwater, Derwent, That thousands on thousands ha'e travell'd to view; The langer they gaze, still the mair they may wonder, And ay, as they wonder, may fin summet new. We've Corby for rocks, caves, and walks sae delightfu', That Eden a paradeyse loudly proclaims; O that sec leyke pleaces hed ay sec leyke awners, Then mud monie girt fwok be proud o' their neames! We've Netherby tui, the grand pride o' the border, And haws out o' number, nae county can bang; Wi' rivers romantic as Tay, Tweed, or Yarrow, And green woodbine bowers weel wordy a sang. We help yen anudder; we welcome the stranger; Oursels and our country we'll iver defend; We pay bits o' taxes as weel as we're yable, And pray, leyke true Britons, the war hed an end: Then, Cummerlan lads, and ye lish rwosy lasses, If some caw ye clownish, ye need'nt think sheame; Be merry and wise, enjoy innocent pleasures, And ay seek for health and contentment at heame. August 12, 1804. THE FELLOWS ROUN TORKIN. A wood-covered hill, near Crofton-Hall, in Cumberland. Tune,ââDrops of brandy.â We're aw feyne fellows roun Torkin; We're aw guid fellows weel met; We're aw wet fellows roun Torkin, Sae faikins we mun hev a swet: Let's drink to the lasses about us, 'Till day's braid glare bids us start; We'll sup till the saller be emptyâ Come, Dicky lad, boddom the whart. I'll gi'e ye, says Dick, durty Dinah, That's ay big wi' bairn fwok suppwose; She sticks out her lip like a pentes, To kep what may drop frae her nwose: Leyke a hay-stack she hoists up ae shouder, And scarts, for she's nit varra soun: Wi' legs thick as mill-pwosts, and greasy, The deevil cud nit ding her down! We're aw odd fellows roun Torkin; We're aw larn'd fellows weel met; We're aw rich fellows roun Torkin, Sae faikins we mun hev a swet: Let's drink to the lasses about us, 'Till day's braid glare bids us part; We'll sup till the saller be emptyâ Come, Matthew lad, boddom the whart. I'll gi'e ye, says Matt, midden Marget, That squints wi' the left-handed ee; When at other fellows she's gleymin, I's freeten'd she's luikin at me: She smells far stranger than carrion, Her cheeks are as dark as hung beef, Her breasts are as flat as a back-buird; 'Mang sluts she's ay counted the chief! We're aw wise fellows roun Torkin; We're aw neyce fellows weel met; We're aw sad fellows roun Torkin, Sae faikins we mun hev a swet: Let's drink to the lasses about us, 'Till day's braid glare bids us part; We'll sup till the saller be emptyâ Come, Gwordy lad, boddom the whart. I'll gi'e ye, says Gworge, geapin Grizzy, Wi' girt feet and marrowless legs; Her reed neb wad set fire to brunstone; Her een are as big as duck eggs: She's shep'd leyke a sweyne i' the middle, Her skin freckl'd aw leyke a gleid; Her mouth's weyde as onie town yubbem, We're freeten'd she'll swally her heed! We're aw strang fellows roun Torkin! We're aw lish fellows weel met; We're aw top fellows roun Torkin, Sae faikins we mun hev a swet: Let's drink to the lasses about us, 'Till day's braid glare bids us start; We'll sup till the saller be emptyâ Come, Wully lad, boddom the whart. I'll gi'e ye, says Wull, winkin Winny, That measures exact three feet eight, But wi' roun-shouder'd Ruth, or tall Tibby, She'll scart, and she'll girn, and she'll feght; She's cruik'd as an Sâwid a hip out, Her feet flat and braid, as big fluiks; Her feace is as lang as a fiddle, And aw spatter'd owre wi' reed plouks! We're aw young fellows roun Torkin; We're aw teeght fellows weel met; We're aw brave fellows roun Torkin, Sae faikins we mun hev a sweat: Let's drink to the lasses about us, 'Till day's braid glare bids us part; We'll sup till the saller be emptyâ Come, Mwosy lad, boddom the whart. I'll gi'e ye, says Mwose, mantin Matty, That lisps thro' her black rotten teeth: You can't catch five words in ten minutes; If gowlin, she'd flay yen to deeth: Her feace like auld Nick's nutmig grater, And yallow neck bitten wi' fleas; She's troubl'd wi' win ay at meale teymes, And belshes to give hersel ease! We're aw cute fellows roun Torkin; We're aw sharp fellows weel met; We're aw rare fellows roun Torkin, Sae faikins we mun hev a swet: Let's drink to the lasses about us, 'Till day's braid glare bids us part; We'll sup till the saller be emptyâ Come, Nathan lad, boddom the whart. I'll gi'e ye, says Natt, noisy Nanny, That chows shag 'bacco for fun; She cocks her belly when walkin, And ay luiks down to the grun: She talks beath sleepin and wakin, And crowks leyke a tead when she speaks; On her nwose en the hair grows leyke stibble, And gravey drops run owre her cheeks! We're aw teugh fellows roun Torkin; We're aw rash fellows weel met; We're aw queer fellows roun Torkin, Sae faikins we mun hev a swet: Let's drink to the lang, leame, and lazy, Deef, dum, black, brown, bleer-e'ed, and blin, May they suin get weel weddet, and beddet, If lads they can onie where fin! BORROWDALE JWOHNNY. Tune,ââI am a young fellow.â I's Borrowdale Jwohnny, just cumt up to Lunnon, Nay, gurn nit at me, for fear I laugh at you: I've seen kneaves donn'd i' silks, and gud men gang in tatters, The truth we sud tell, aud gi'e auld Nick his due. Nan Watt pruiv'd wi' bairn, what, they caw'd me the fadder; Thinks I, shekum-filthy! be off in a treyce! Nine Carel bank nwotes mudder slipt i' my pocket, And fadder neist ga'e me reet holesome adveyce. Says he, âkeep frae t' lasses! and ne'er luik ahint thee.â We're deep as the best o' them, fadder, says I. They pack'd up ae sark, Sunday weascwoat, twee neckcloths, Wot bannock, cauld dumplin, and top stannin pye: I mounted black filly, bad God bliss the auld fwok, Cries fadder, âTou's larn'd, Jwohn, and hes nought to fear; Caw and see cousin Jacep! he's got aw the money: He'll git thee some guverment pleace,âto be seer!â I stopp'd on a fell, tuik a lang luik at Skiddaw, And neist at the schuil-house amang the esh trees; Last thing, saw the smuik rising up frae our chimley, And fan aw quite queer, wid a heart ill at ease: But summet widin me, cried, Pou up thy spirits! Theer's luck, says auld Lizzy, in feacin the sun; Tou's young, lish and cliver, may wed a feyne leady, And cum heame a nabobâaye, sure as a gun! Knowin manners, what, I doff'd my hat to aw strangers, Wid a spur on ae heel, a yek siplin in han, It tuik me nine days and six hours comin up-bank, At the Whornsâaye, 'twas Highget, a chap bad me stan; Says he, âHow's all friens i' the North, honest Johnny?â Odswunters! I says, what, ye divent ken me!â I paid twee wheyte shillins, and fain was to see him, Nit thinkin on't rwoad onie 'quaintance to see. Neist thing, what big kurks, gilded cwoaches, hee houses, And fwok runnin thro' other, leyke Carel Fair; I ax'd a smart chap where to fin cousin Jacep, Says he, âClown, go look!â Friend, says I, tell me where? Fadder' letter to Jacep hed got nae subscription, Sae, when I was glowrin and siz'lin about, A wheyte-feac'd young lass aw dess'd out leyke a leady, Cried, âPray, Sir, step in!â but I wish I'd kept out. She pou'd at a bell, leyke our kurk-bell it soundet, In com sarvant lass, and she worder'd some weyne; Says I, I's nit dry, sae, pray, Madam, excuse me! Nay, what she insisted I sud stop and deyne. She meade varra free,â'twas a shem and a byzen! I thought her in luive wi' my parson, for sure; And promis'd to caw agean:âas for black filly, (Wad onie believ't!) she was stown frae the duir! Od dang't! War than that:âwhen I greap'd my breek-pocket, I fan fadder watch, and the nwotes were aw gean; It was neet, and I luik'd lang and sair for kent feaces, But Borrowdale fwok I cud niver see neane. I sleept on the flags, just abint the kurk corner, A chap wid a girt stick and lantern com by, He caw'd me peace-breakerâsays I, Thou's a learâ In a pleace leyke a saller they fworc'd me to lie. Nae caff bed or blankets for silly pilgarlic; Deil a wink cud I sleep, nay nor yet see a steyme; Neist day I was ta'en to the Narration Offish, When a man in a wig said, I'd duin a sad creyme. Then ane ax'd my neame, and he pat on his speckets, Says I, Jwhonny CruckdeykeâI's Borrowdale bworn. Whea think ye it pruiv'd, but my awn cousin Jacep, He seav'd me fraet gallows, aye that varra mworn. He spak to my Lword, some hard words, quite out-landish, Then caw'd forhiscwoach, and away weruid heame; He ax'd varra kind efter fadder and mudder, I said they were bravely, and neist saw his deame: She's aw puff and pouder; as for cousin Jacep, He's got owre much gear to tek nwotish o' me; But if onie amang ye sud want a lish sarvent, Just bid me a weageâI'll upod ye, we's 'gree. January 4, 1807. THE CODBECK WEDDIN. Tune,ââAndrew Carr.â True is my song, tho' lowly be the strain. They sing of a weddin at Worton, Where aw was feght, fratchin, and fun; Feegh! see a yen we've hed at Codbeck, As niver was under the sun: The breydegruim was weaver Joe Bewley, He com frae about Lowthet Green; The breyde Jwohnny Dalton' lish dowter, And Betty was weel to be seen. Sec patchin, and weshin, and bleachin, And starchin, and darnin auld duds; Some lasses thought lang to the weddin; Unax'd, others sat i' the suds: Theer were tweescwore and seebem inveyted, God speed tem 'gean Cursenmas-day; âDobson' lads, tui, what they mun cum hidder!â I think they were better away! Furst thing, Oggle Willy, the fiddler, Caw'd in wi' auld Jonathan Strang; Neist stiff and stout, lang, leame and lazy, Frae aw parts com in wi' a bang: Frae Brocklebank, Fuilduirs, and Newlands, Frae Hesket, Burk-heads, and the Height, Frae Warnell, Starnmire, Nether Welton, And awt' way frae Eytonfield-street. Furst auld Jwhonny Dawton we'll nwotish, And Mary, his canny douse deame; Son Wully, and Mally, his sister; Goffet' weyfe, Muckle Nanny by neame; Wully Sinclair, Smith Leytle, Jwohn Aitchin, Tom Ridley, Joe Sim, Peter Weir, Gworge Goffet, Jwohn Bell, Miller Dyer, Joe Head, and Ned Bulman were theer. We'd hay-cruiks, and hen-tails, and hanniels, And nattlers that fuddle for nought; Wi' sceape-greaces, skeybels, and scruffins, And maffs better fed far than taught; We'd lads that wad eat for a weager, Or feght, aye, till bluid to the knees; Fell-seyders, and Sowerby riff-raff, That deil a bum-bealie dar seize. The breyde hung her head, and luik'd sheepish, The breydegruim as wheyte as a clout; The bairns aw gleym'd thro' the kurk windows, The parson was varra devout: The ring was lost out of her pocket, The breyde meade a bonny te-dee; Cries Goffet' weyfe, âMeyne's meade o' pinchback, And, la ye! it fits till a tee!â Now buckl'd, wi' fiddlers afwore them, They gev Michael Crosby a caw; Up spak canny Bewley the breydegruim, âGet slocken'd, lads! fadder pays aw.â We drank till aw seem'd blue about us, We're ay murry deevils, tho' peer; Michael' weyfe says, âWidout onie leein, A duck mud ha'e swam on the fleer.â Now, aw 'bacco'd owre, and hawf-drucken, The men fwok wad needs kiss the breyde; Joe Head, that's ay reckon'd best spwokesman, Whop'd âguid wad the couple beteyde:â Says Michael, âI's reet glad to see you, Suppwosin I gat ne'er a plack.â Cries t' weyfe, âThat'll nowther pay brewer, Nor git bits o' sarks to yen's back.â The breyde wad dance âCoddle me, Cuddy;â A threesome then caper'd Scotch Reels; Peter Weir cleek'd up auld Mary Dalton, Leyke a cock roun a hen neist he steals; Jwohn Bell yelp'd out âSowerby Lasses;â Young Jwosep, a lang Country dance, He'd got his new pumps Smithson meade him, And fain wad shew how he cud prance. To march roun the town, and keep swober, The women fwok thought was but reet; âBe wise, dui, for yence!â says Jwohn Dyer; The breydegruim mud reyde shouder heet: The youngermak lurried ahint them, Till efter them Bell meade a brek; Tom Ridley was aw baiz'd wi' drinkin, And plung'd off the steps i' the beck. To Hudless's now off they sizell'd, And theer gat far mair than eneugh; Miller Hodgson suin brunt the punch ladle, And full'd ev'ry glass wid his leuf; He thought he was tekin his mouter, And deil a bit conscience hes he; They preym'd him wi' stiff punch and jollup, 'Till Sally Scott thought he wad dec. Joe Sim rwoar'd out, âBin, we've duin wonders! Our Mally's turn'd howe i' the weame!â Wi' three strings atween them, the fiddlers Strack up, and they reel'd towerts heame; Meyner Leytle wad now hoist a standert, Peer man! he cud nit daddle far, But stuck in a pant buin the middle, And yen tuik him heame in a car. For dinner, we'd stew'd geuse, and haggish, Cow'd-leady, and het bacon pye, Boil'd fluiks, tatey-hash, beastin puddin, Saut salmon, and cabbish; forby Pork, pancakes, black puddins, sheep trotters, And custert, and mustert, and veal, Grey-pez keale, and lang apple dumplins:â I wish ev'ry yen far'd as weel! The breyde, geavin aw roun about her, Cries, âWuns! we forgat butter sops!â The breydegruim fan nae teyme for talkin, But wi' stannin pye greas'd his chops. We'd loppar'd milk, skim'd milk, and kurn'd milk, Well watter, smaw beer, aw at yence; âShaff! bring yell in piggens!â rwoars Dalton, âDeil tek them e'er cares for expence!â Now aw cut and cleek'd frae their neybors, 'Twas even down thump, pull and haul; Joe Head gat a geuse aw together, And off he crap into the faul: Muckle Nanny cried, âShem o' sec weastry!â The ladle she brak owre ILL Bell; Tom Dalton sat thrang in a corner, And eat nar the weight of his sel. A hillibuloo was now started, 'Twas âRannigal! whee cares for tee?â âStop, Tommy! whee's weyfe was i' th' carras! Tou'd ne'er been a man, but for me!â âOd dang thee!âââTo jail I cud sen thee, Peer scraffles!âââThy lan grows nae gurse.â âNe'er ak! it's my awn, and it's paid forâ But whee was't stuil auld Tim Jwohn' purse?â Ned Bulman wad feght wi' Gworge Goffet, Peer Gwordy he nobbet stript thin, And luik'd leyke a cock out o' fedder, But suin gat a weel-bleaken'd skin; Neist, Sanderson fratch'd wid a hay-stack, And Deavison fught wi' the whins: Smith Leytle fell out wi' the cobbles, And peel'd aw the bark of his shins. The hay-bay was now somewhat seyded, And young fwok the music men miss'd, They'd drucken leyke fiddlers in common, And fawn owre ayont an aul kist; Some mair fwok that neet were a-missin, Than Wully, and Jonathan Strangâ But decency whispers, âWhat matter! Tou munnet put them in the sang!â Auld Dalton thought he was at Carel; Says he, âJacob! see what's to pay! Come, wosler! heasteâget out the horses, We'll e'en teake the rwoad, and away!â He cowp'd off his stuil, leyke a san bag, Tom Ridley beel'd out, âDeil may care!â For a whart o' het yell, and a stick in't, Dick Simson 'll tell ye far mair. Come, bumper the Cummerlan lasses, Their marrows can seldom be seen; And he that won't feght to defend them, I wish he may ne'er want black een! May our murry-neets, clay-daubins, races, And weddins, ay finish wi' glee; And when ought's amang us worth nwotish, Lang may I be present to see! THE ILL-GIEN WEYFE, AN OWRE TRUE PICTURE O' MONIE. Tune,ââMy wife has taen the gee.â A toilsome leyfe, for thurty years, I patiently hev spent, As onie yen o' onie rank, I this weyde warl e'er kent; For when at heame, or when away, Nae peace ther is for me; I's pestert wid an ill-gien weyfe, That niver lets me be: Ay teazin, ne'er ceasin, Leyke an angry sea; Nae kurk-bell e'er hed sec a tongue, And oft it deefens me! When furst I saw her mealy feace, 'Twas painted up sae feyne, I thowt her e'en fit for a queenâ She wan this heart o' meyne; But sin' that hour, that sworry hour, We ne'er cud yence agree; And oft I curse the luckless day I pawn'd my liberty: Care an sorrow, then to morrow Ay the seame mun be; Oh! had I coffin'd been, that day I lost my liberty! When young, I wish'd for weyfe and weeans, But now the thowt I scworn; Thank Heav'n, a bairn o' owther sex To me she ne'er has bworn! Leyke fuils we wish our youth away, When happy we mud beâ Aw ye whee're pleagued wi' scauldin weyves, I wish ye suin set free! Grin, grinnin!âdin, dinnin! Toil and misery! Better feed the kurk-yard wurms, Than leeve sec slaves as we! I's past aw wark, it's hard to want, An auld and peer am I; But happiness i' this veyle warl, Nae gear cud iver buy: O wer I on some owre sea land, Nae women nar to see, At preyde an grander I wad smeyle, An thanks to Heav'n wad gie: O woman! foe to man! A blessin thou sud be; But wae to him that wears thy chain, Peer wretch unblest leyke me! When wintry blasts blow loud an keen, I's fain to slink frae heame; An rader feace the angry storm, Than hur I hate to neame: Wheyle she wi' sland'rous cronies met, Sit's hatchin monie a lee; The seet wad flay auld Nick away, Or vex a saint to see, Puff, puffin!âsnuff, snuffin! Ne'er frae mischief free; How waak is lwordly boastin man, On sec to cast an ee! If to a neybor's house I steal, To crack a wheyle at neet, She hurries ti' me leyke a deil, An flays the fwok to see't; Whate'er I dui, whate'er I say, Wi' hur a faut mun be; I freet an freet baith neet an day, But seldom clwose an ee: Wake, wakin!âshak, shakin! Then she teks the gee; He's happy that leevs aw his leane, Compar d wi' chaps leyke me. To stop the niver-ceasin storm, I brong her cousin here; She aw but brak the wee thing's heart, An cost her monie a tear: If chance a frien pops in his heed, Off to the duir she'll flee; She snarls leyke onie angry cat, An sair I's vex'd to see! Now fratchin, neist scratchin, Oft wi' bleaken'd ee, I pray auld Nick hed sec a deame, I trow he vex'd wad be! How blithe man meets the keenest ills, I' this shwort voyage o' leyfe, And thinks nae palace leyke his heame, Blest wid a keyndly weyfe: But sure the greatest curse hard fate To onie man can gie, Is sec a filthy slut as meyne, That ne'er yence comforts me; Lads jeerin, lasses sneerin, Cuckold some caw me; I scrat an auld grey achin pow, But darn't say they lee. They're happy that hev teydey weyves, To keep peer bodies clean; But meyne's a freetfu' lump o' filth, Her marra ne'er was seen: Ilk dud she wears upon her back, Is poison to the ee; Her smock's leyke auld Nick's nuttin bag, The deil a word I lee: Dour an' durtyâhouse aw clarty! See her set at tea, Her feace defies baith seape an san, To mek't just fit to see! A beyte o' meat I munnet eat, Seave what I cuik mysel; Ae patch or clout she'll nit stick on, Sae heame's just leyke a hell: By day or neet, if out o' seet. Seafe frae this canker'd she, I pray and pray, wi' aw my heart, Deeth, suin tek hur or me! Fleyte, fleytin!âfeght, feghtin! How her luik I dree! Come tyrant rid me o' this curse, Dui tek her! I'll thank thee! ROB LOWRIE. Tune,ââAuld Rob Morris.â I've seen thirty Summers strow flow'rs i' the glen, But annuder blithe Summer I'll ne'er see again! I've hed monie wooers, frae clown to the beau, But I've lost Rob Lowrie, the flow'r o' them aw! The furst was Joe Coupland, when I was fifteen; The neist was Wull Wawby, and then com Gib Green; An' Jwohn o' Kurkan'rews, and Sly Dicky Slee, But bonny Rob Lowrie was dearest to me! 'Twas last Durdar reaces, he rid the black cowt, And widout onie whuppin, he bang't tem leyke owt; And then when they russel'd, the lads how he felt! And off heame we canter't, wi' breydle and belt. At neets when we daunder't alang Cauda seyde, He'd promise, and promise to mek me his breyde; An'then our twee neames he wad carve on the steyleâ Lord help the peer lasses men seek to beguile! I luik owre the pastureânae Rob's to be seen! Then sit down, heart-broken, an' tears blin my een: My mudder she fratches, frae mwornin till neet, And lasses keep flyrin', wheniver we meet. When singin', Rob Lowrie was ay i' my sang; Now thoughts o' Rob Lowrie hae turn'd me quite wrang; He's weel-shep'd, an' lusty, he stans six feet twee; Theer's health in his fair feace, and luive in his ee! But whee's this comes whuslin', sae sweet, owre the hill? He brings me a pwoseyâIt's e'en Gwordie Gill! He's lish, an' he's canny, wi' reed curly hairâ The Deil tek Rob Lowrie! I'll heed him nae mair! THE LASSES OF CAREL. The lasses o' Carel are weel shep'd, and bonny, But he that wad win yen mun brag of his gear; You may follow, and follow, till heart-sick and weary, To get them needs siller, and feyne claes to wear: They'll catch at a reed cwoat, leyke as monie mackrel, And jump at a fop, or e'en lissen a fuil; Just brag of an uncle, that's got heaps of money, And deil a bit ods, if you've ne'er been at schuil! I yence follow'd Marget, the twoast amang aw maks, And Peg hed a red cheek, and bonny dark ee; But suin as she fan I depended on labour, She snurl'd up her neb, and nae mair luik'd at me: This meks my words gud, nobbet brag o' yer uncle, And get a peer hawf-wit to trumpet yer praise, You may catch whee you will, they'll caress ye, and bless yeâ It's money, nit merit, they seek now-a-days! I neist follow'd Nelly, and thowt her an angel, And she thowt me aw that a mortal sud be; A rich whupper-snapper just stept in atween us, Nae words efter that pass'd atween Nell and me: This meks my words gud, nobbet brag o' yer uncle, They'll feght, ay leyke mad cats, to win yer sly smeyle; And watch ye, to catch ye, now gazin' and praisin', They're angels to luik at, wi' hearts full o' geyle! THE DAYS THAT ARE GEANE. Tune,ââThe muckin' o' Geordie's byre.â Now, weyfe, sin the day-leet hes left us, And drizzly sleet's 'ginnin to fa', Let's creep owre the heartsome turf ingle, And laugh the weyld winter awa'; Contented, thou spins the lang e'enin', And I wi' my peype envy neane; Then why shou'd we peyne about richesâ Let's think o' the days that are geane. This crazy auld chair, when I think on't, Nae wonder a tear blins my ee; 'Twas e'en my puir fadders, God rest him! He valued this warl nit a flea: His maxim was, be guid, and dui guid; To mortal he wadna gie painâ My chair's mair than gilded throne to me, It prop'd the leel fellow that's gane. Thy wheel that's gien cleedin' to monie, O' mortals ay puts me i' meynd; The spoke now at top, is suin lowest, And thus it oft fares wi' mankeynd: The clock, clickin', tells how Teyme passes, A moment he'll tarry for neane; Contented we'll welcome to-morrow, Ay thankfu' for days that are geane. Now fifty shwort years hae flown owre us, Sin furst we fell in at the fair; I've monie a teyme thowt, wi' new pleasure, Nae weyfe cud wi' Jenny compare: Tho' thy rwose has gien way to the wrinkle, At changes we munna complain; They're rich, whea in age are leet-hearted, And mourn nit for days that are geane. Our bairns are heale, hearty, and honest, And willinly toil thro' the year; Our duty we ay hae duin ti' them, And poverty e'en let them bear: Theer's Jenny hes larnin', and manners, And Wully can match onie yen; We tought tem my guid fadder's maxim, And they'll bliss the auld fwok, when geane. Theer's ae thing I lang, lang hae pray'd for, Sud tyrant Deeth teer thee away, And rob me o' life's dearest treasure, May he gie me a caw the seame day! If fworc'd to resign my auld lassie, I cuddent lang linger my leane; I'd creep to thy greave, broken-hearted, Wi' thowts o' the days that are geane. CAREL FAIR. Tune,ââWoo'd an married an a'.â My neame's Jurry Jurden, frae Threlket; Just swat down, and lissen my sang: I'll mappen affword some divarsion, An tell ye how monie things gang. Crops o' aw maks are gud; tateys lang as lapstens, an dry as meal. Teymes are sae sae; for the thin-chop'd, hawf-neak'd, trimlin beggars, flock to our house, leyke bees tot' hive: an our Cwoley bit sae monie, I just tuck'd him up i' th' worchet.

Fwok sud aw dui, as they'd be duin tui; an it's naturable, to beg, rader nor starve or steal; efter aw the rattle! Some threep, et the teymes 'll git better; An laugh to see onie repeyne: I's nae pollytishin, that's sarten, But Englan seems in a decleyne!

Thur flay-crows wear lasses stays; an buy my Lword Wellinten's buits; cokert but nit snout-bandet. Mey sarty! sec a laugh I gat, to see a tarrier meakin watter on yen o' ther legs! They're seerly mungrels, hawf monkey breed; shept for awt warl leyke wasps, smaw it' middle. To see them paut pauten about, puts me i' meyn o' our aul gander; an if they meet a canny lass, they darn't turn roun to luik at her. The âTurk's Heed,â an âTir'd Spwortsman,â are bonny seynes, but a dandy wad be far mair comical; efter aw the rattle! But, shaf o' sec odd trinkum-trankums!

Thur leed-heedet whups dui muckle mischief; a sairy beggar gat a bluidy nwose, an broken teeth, i' the fray. Hill-top Tom, an Low-gill Dick, the twea feghtin rapscallions, wer luggt off by the bealies, to my lword Mayor's offish; an thrussen into the black whol.

What, I seed fadder talkin to t' lawyer, an gowl'd tull my een wer sair: but nae mischief was duin; efter aw the rattle! Then peer bits o' hawf-broken farmers In leggins, were struttin about; Wer teymes gud, they'd aw become dandiesâ We'll ne'er leeve to see that, I doubt!

Tune,âBy the Author. Now clwos'd for ay thy cwoal-black een, That lang, lang gaz'd on me!âOh! Wully! An leyfeless lies that manly form, I ay was fain to see; my Wully! Ah! luckless hour, thou struive for heame, Last neet, 'cross Eden weyde!âDear Wully! This mworn a stiffen'd corpse brong in;â It's warse than deeth to beyde!âOh! Wully! The owlet hootet sair yestreen, An threyce the suit it fell!âOh! Wully! The teyke com leate, an bark'd aloud; It seem'd the deein kneel o' Wully: Deep wer the snows, keen, keen my woes; The bairns oft cried for thee, their Wully: I trimlin said, âHe'll suin be hereââ They ne'er yence clwos'd an eeâOh! Wully! An when I saw the thick sleet faw, A bleezin fire I meade for Wully; An watch'd, an watch'd, as it grew dark, An I grew mair afraid for Wully: I thowt I hard the powney's feet, An ran, the voice to hear o' Wully; The win blew hollow, but nae sound My sinkin heart did cheerâOh! Wully! The clock struck yen, the clock struck twee, The clock struck three, at four, nae Wully; I hard, wi' joy, the powney's feet, An thowt my cares were owre for Wully: The powney neigh'd, but thou was lost; I sank upon the ground, for Wully; Suin, where I lay, appear'd thy ghost, An whisper'd, thou wert drown'dâOh! Wully! The muin was up, in vain I sowt The stiffen'd corpse o' theyne, lost Wully! 'Twill suin, suin mingle wi' the dust, An nar it, sae wull meyneâOh! Wully! Gang, dry your tears, my bairns five! Gang, dry your tears o' sorrow, dearies! Your fadder's cares are at an en, An sae may ours, to-morrow, dearies! SONGS. LUCY GRAY, OF ALLENDALE. Say, have you seen the blushing rose, The blooming pink, or lily pale? Fairer than any flow'r that blows, Was Lucy Gray, of Allendale. Pensive at eve, down by the burn, Where oft the maid they us'd to hail, The shepherds now are heard to mourn, For Lucy Gray, of Allendale. With her to join the sportive dance, Far have I stray'd o'er hill and vale, Then pleas'd, each rustic stole a glance At Lucy Gray, of Allendale. I sighing view yon hawthorn shade, Where first I told a loves's tale; For now low lies the matchless maid, Sweet Lucy Gray, of Allendale. I cannot toil, and seldom sleep; My parents wonder what I ail: While others rest, I wake and weep, For Lucy Gray, of Allendale. A load of grief preys on my breast, In cottage, or in darken'd vale;â Come, welcome death! O, let me rest Near Lucy Gray, of Allendale! THE MOUNTAIN BOY. In the midst of the many craggy heath-covered mountains in Scotland, round which I had to wind my weary way, between New Galloway and Newton Stewart, there are only two houses, and these wretched smokey hovels. Near the first, early on a cold snowy morning of March, I beheld a boy wandering down a barren hill not far from the road. He wore a piece of plaid. His voice and speech were pleasing, and his rosy smile bespoke health and content. A short conversation gave rise to this song. It was committed to paper at the next cottage, after warming my benumbed limbs over a turf ingle on the centre of a floor, while around me played the healthy and beautiful children. âShepherd lad, thinly clad, leave these bleak mountains, Fly to the town and its pleasures with me; There lofty buildings and grandeur surround us, There gay-deck'd gentle-folk proud thou wilt see: What are thy comforts, where tempests loud howling, Threaten thy thin flocks that shelter have none? Where is thy dwelling, boy? house is not near us; Leave these wilds, shepherd lad, with me begone!â âTraveller, weel clad, ye canna entice me; Thir mountains o' hether to me are sae dear; I heed na the snell blast that maks ye aw tremble; Nae grandeur I covet, nae poverty fear: In you clay built cottage, sits Maggy, my mither, A twinin' grey plaidin' for faither and I; Our coarse fare is wholesomeâwe ay rest contentedâ What mair can the walth o' the proud city buy?â âShepherd lad, nature's child, quit not thy mountains; Woe be to him who would lure thee from home! The flocks rejoice at thy voiceâthou art contentedâ In vain to proud cities for this man may roam: Rosy health paints thy cheekâhardy art thou and free, No lux'ry tempts thee, nor trinkets of pride; Love of fond parents and home fills that bare breast; And, oh! may simplicity still be thy guide!â âTraveller, gentle, creep into yon smoky hut, Taste our milk, oat-cake, and cleanly Scotch fare; Mither's ay glad when she welcomes a stranger; A drap o' her whiskey she's ay proud to spare.â Tweed! guid dog! hie away! lammies ill bear the blast, Up Craigenyelder, and stormy Drumlock!â Health on your journey, Sir! Guidness watch o'er ye! Tho' wild are thir grey hills, they're a'dear to Jock!â MARY. Tune,ââLoch Erroch Side.â O Mary! when the wild wind blows, And blasts the beauties o' the rose; Thy coming fate to me it shews, And I cou'd weep for Mary. Aft has the blossom deck'd the tree, Sin first thy glancin tell-tale ee Confest a wee bit luive for me, And I was smit wi' Mary. O Mary! I hae loe'd thee lang; Thou'rt ay the burthen o' my sang; For day or night, where'er I gang, I think o' nought but Mary. When sleep seals up my wearied ee, In dreams thy angel form I see; And in fond raptures, say to thee, O, dinna leave me, Mary! O Mary! when the warl's unkind, And poverty thraws me behind, I ay can cheer my drooping mind Wi' thoughts o' thee, sweet Mary; For were I sick, and like to die, Thy witching smile wad comfort me; Then come what will, my wish shall be For happiness to Mary. THE FARMER'S WELCOME HOME. Tune,âBy the Author. Do you know what it is makes me whistle and sing, As I brush the bright dews away? Do you know what it is makes me blithe as a king, As I toil in the fields all day? If you don't, why I'll tell you the cause of my joys; When the grey hour of Evening's come, 'Tis the thoughts of my rosy-fac'd girls and boys, Who welcome their father home. On ent'ring, I'm quickly surrounded by all; The youngest climbs up to my knee; Tom sings a new song; Bess shows me her doll; And Hannah brings food for me. My wife turns her wheel; we cheerfully talk, Nor fret about evils to come; I taste joys, unknown to your gouty great folkâ Rosy health bids me welcome home! My children I teach to pray and to read, To do good, honour priest and the squire; If my farm be but small, we no luxuries need, It serves us; no more we desire! I kill my own mutton; my wife brews good ale; From my fields I have no wish to roam, Except to the market, and then I ne'er fail To meet a blithe welcome home. Hannah reads in her bible, ere we go to rest; The youngest lisps o'er her pray'rs; I rise when the lark quits his cold dewy nest, And leave them to sleep away cares: Tho' little we boast, others' wants we supplyâ If we see a poor beggarman roam, We do as all should do, as they'd be done by, We give him a welcome home. All taxes and tythes I most cheerfully payâ For the lawyer I care not a pin! Passers by from the town tell the news of the day, And if thirsty, find plenty within; All neighbours I serve; to do good is my text; And when life's closing day shall come, I'll this world quit with pleasure, and hope in the next, To meet a good welcome home! THE OUTCAST MOTHER. The wind blew loud, the night was dark, And heavy fell the rain, When on the moor a hapless fair, Aloud did thus complain: âOh! do not, do not weep, my sweet! I cannot shelter thee! Sleep, sleep, my little baby boy, There is no sleep for me! âAlas! no cottage lends its light, To guide us on our way! A house, or home, love, we have none; This is our home till day: Yes! we are doom'd to bear the storm, Far, far from bush or tree; But I would heed no angry blast, Were it not, boy, for thee! âDear cause of all my sufferings, Poor living mark of shame! My heart was spotless, as is thine, Until thy father came: Love was, alas! my only crime, Yes, baby boy, like thee, I late was innocence itself, Now there's no rest for me! âI by my parent am despis'd, And friend I know not one; He who shou'd our protector be, Far, far away is gone: He flatter'd, ruin'd, left me To want and miseryâ Sweet baby boy, cling to my breast, I fain would comfort thee! âO did my father hear thy cries, Methinks we yet might live; And may that Pow'r who guides the storm, His cruelty forgive! I late his only darling was, And he was kind to me;â Ah! little think'st thou, weeping boy, What I've endur'd for thee! âTho' little do we need, child, None will our wants supply; Thy mother oft has fed the poor, But soon for want must die: The world, alas! is pitiless; There is no charity; O do not weep so, baby, boy! I cannot shelter thee! âO rise, thou silver orb of night, A mourner's breast to cheer; And in some out-house we may rest, Till morning shall appear! âAh! does thou at the lightning start? Cling closer, love, to me! No storm, no lightning I would dread, Were it not, boy, for thee! âHow cold, cold are thy little feet, Poor trembling child of woe! But colder by thy mother's side, Thou soon wilt be laid low: Death will ere morn our sorrows end, And rest give thee and me! âO weep no more, my baby boy, I cannot comfort thee! âI feel the welcome pangs of death, And giddy turns my brain;â O God of mercy, hear my pray'r, Nor let me ask in vain! Forgive the errors of my life, My only hope's in thee! âOne kiss, my babe!âAlas! I die! Soon, soon thou'lt rest with me!â BRITONS, UNITED, THE WORLD MAY DEFY. WRITTEN DURING A THREATENED INVASION. Ye sons of the brave, who erst conquer'd at Cressy, And the war-bolts of vengeance on nations oft hurl'd, Whose heroes triumphant, encircled with glory, To stem proud oppression, the sails oft unfurl'd; Rise, rise! now the war-whoop o'er Britain is sounding, And this be your song, let us conquer or die! Beware of fell faction, and conquest awaits you, For Britons, united, the world may defy. Where, where is the bosom that beats not with ardour, To meet the invaders who threaten our coast? Where, where is the arm that would not strike with fury, To hurl to destruction a tyrannic host? Avaunt, ye pale cowards, who shrink at the danger! 'Tis the boast of the virtuous their country to save; Your children shall blush for their terror-struck fathers While Freedom shall weep o'er the tombs of the brave! Shall a pigmy usurper whose laurels are blighted, Who scorns the Creator, and laughs at his pow'r, Shall a horde of assassins long stain'd with foul slaughter, Forge chains for a Briton? No! welcome the hour, When Gallia's proud vassals, by bombast deluded, Shall dare to the conflict of nations the pride! âIn vain on the white cliffs of Albion we wait them, The blood of their warriors shall crimson the tide! Remember our fathers, who fell on the scaffold, And purchas'd with blood, what we boldly dare claim; Remember proud Spain, and her long-wept Armada, Then prove to the world, Britons still are the same! By the dear ties of nature! by beauty's soft graces! By freedom! by justice! we'll conquer or die! And vengeance shall blast the dark foes of their country, For Britons, united, the world may defy! THE EVENING WALK. Tune,ââGuid night and joy be wi' ye a'.â The Sun has taen his fareweel blink; The ploughman quits his usefu' toil; Come, Jean, let's leave the noisy town, And watch dame nature's evening smile: Wi' health we'll sport on Eden's banks, In love, like our first parents, blest; For dearer is my Jean to me, Than a' the walth o' east or west! The linnet lo'es the whiten'd thorn; The thrush sings frae the willow tree; The lark has sought the rising corn; And hameward winds the busy bee: The scaly tribe, in stream or pool, Feed fearless o' their artfu' foe; These trembling shun the haunts o' man, And live by nature's simple law. The darkning dells, the fading fells, The bleating flocks, the ruddy farm, The tinkling streams, the gentle gales, Let these thy youthfu' fancy charm; And think how soon stern Winter's frown Will strip the meadow, bank, and tree; The present hours are only ours, Then share these rural joys wi' me! Far frae the town, and a' its cares, The shafts o' slander we'll defy; Dear virtuous love shall be our theme, That ay delighteth thee and I: And as we pass some lowly shed, And mark a cheerfu' rustic scene, Oft will I wish that cot were mine, Wou'd'st thou but share it wi' me, Jean! We'll stray unseen by tell-tale een, And trace the glen, and silent grove; Whilst high abuin, the silver muin Shall witness be to my fond love: Then taste o' pleasure, in thy prime, Youth quickly flies, ne'er to return; And when age wrinkles thy sweet face, Think, wi' a smile, o' life's fair morn! MAD MARGERY. Poor Margery sits on the shore by the willow; Pale and woe-worn her looks, for distracted is she; To the winds she complains, and chides each foaming billow, And oft is the sea-weed poor Margery's pillow, Whose treasure's entomb'd in the sea. Poor Margery lov'd, and a youth more enchanting Ne'er woo'd a fair maiden, or sail'd the salt wave; Their bliss to complete but a few years were wanting, Fir'd by glory, he left her, his tender heart panting, But soon found a watery grave. Poor Margery long watch'd her lover's returning, Oft fond expectation the ship brought in view; Peace at length wav'd her olive, with pain'd bosom burning, She heard the sad tidings that chang'd hope to mourning, How his loss was bewail'd by the crew. Now faded's the face many a rustic call'd pretty; Sun-burnt are her cheeks, sunk and languid her eyes; To the loud-screaming sea-bird she sings her wild ditty, But shuns ev'ry stranger, or laughs at their pity, And weeps, when a vessel she spies. At her breast hangs the token of love, giv'n at parting, Which daily she washes with love's painful tears; Now vacantly gazing, now frantic upstarting, Remembrance across her disorder'd brain darting, The voice of her lover she hears. No more must the morning awake her to gladness; No more her torn bosom can harbour sweet peace. Ah, poor luckless maiden! abandon'd to sadness, He who rides on the wind can alone heal thy madness, And bid all thy sorrowings cease! THE CAPTURE OF THE CHESAPEAKE. This fight took place off Boston Light House, on the 1st of June, 1813. The British Frigate, Shannon, was commanded by Sir Philip Bowes Vere Broke, Baronet, of Nacton, Suffolk; and the United States' Frigate, Chesapeake, by Captain Lawrence, who died of his wounds. The latter had on board 440 men; the former 330; notwithstanding the superior force of the enemy, the cheers of victory were heard in eleven minutes from the commencement of the action. Columbia's vain sons, long deluded by France, Have dar'd to the conflict the lords of the main; Britannia, insulted, cried, âWarriors advance! Ah! let not the shades of your fathers complain!â This call made their shores echo loudly our cannon, For Broke led the band, and the word was, âbe free!â Then while by the Chesapeake, or by the Shannon, The ocean's supplied, we the rulers will be! Old Neptune enrag'd, when he heard what was plann'd By upstarts, unknown in the annals of fame, Bade his sons of the waves match their brethren on land, Nor let one dark record e'er sully the name: Soon one sought their shore, struck the young states with wonder, He'd prove Britons firm as their own native oak; And scarce the proud foe heard the sound of our thunder, Till Britons struck home, led the way by a Broke! Long, long such great deeds may posterity boast! Long, long be such themes the delight of each Bard! Be grateful to those who protect our white coastâ The love of his country's the hero's reward! While a Broke leads our tars, and loud echoes their thunder, No laws foreign tyrants to Britons shall give; Our deeds, as of old, shall strike Europe with wonder, And free as the air on our mountains we'll live! NEGRO AFFECTION. Poor Zeila on wide water gaze, Where white man tear her love away; In vain she to poor Oran prays; In vain she call the ship to stay. Back to her hut can Zeila go? From Oran dear how can she sleep? When Zeila breast swell big wid woe, When Zeila eye do nought but weep. Rise, Sun of Morn! but give no light To cruel man who him enslave! Poor Oran pine, far, far from sight, Or now lie dead below cold wave. But if him live, him see no more The big tear drop from Zeila' eye; Then where white man poor Oran tore, I'll sit me down, and soon will die. THE DEATH OF CRAZY JANE. Set to music by Mr. Hook. 'Twas at the hour when night retreating, Bade the screech-owl seek his nest; Gloomy vapours slow were fleeting, Morning glimmer'd in the east: On the heath, her wild woes telling, To the winds, and beating rain, Cold, unshelter'd, far from dwelling; Trembling sat poor Crazy Jane. âAh!â she cried, âye scenes around me, Witnesses of Henry's art; Witnesses he faithful found me, How he broke this tender heart: Go, ye wild winds, try to move him! Bid him heal this heart again; Did he know how much I love him, He would pity Crazy Jane. âHenry comes; I see him yonder, Dart like lightning o'er the heath! Ah! no! no! my senses wanderâ Since he comes not, welcome death!â Fainting, on the earth she laid her; Soon, in pity to her pain, Death, where love had first betray'd her, Gave relief to Crazy Jane. MARY. Tune,ââMiss Forbes's Farewell to Bamf.â I've known my share o' warldly care, And poverty is ay my lot; But, Mary, when on thee I gaze, Dull care and puirtith are forgot: Thou art the sweet'ner o' my life; Thou art Golconda's wealth to me; And by thy bosom, pure as white, I'll love thee, Mary, till I die! O, were we on some desert Isle, Where human foot ne'er trod before, My arms shou'd be thy couch a' day, And I wou'd gaze, and love thee more! I'd shield thee frae ilk angry blast, Thou dearest gem on earth to me! For by thy speaking een, I swear, To love thee, Mary, till I die! The lavrock hails the rising morn; The gowdspink loes the thorny spray; The cushat coos within the wood; The plover seeks the pasture grey: I envy these what these enjoy, But hope ne'er wares a smile on me; I hug the chain that gies me pain, For I maun love thee, till I die! POOR WILL. Set to Music by Mr. Thomson. See'st thou the gay mansion that stands on yon hill, With gardens before and behind? There once stood the cottage of poor peasant Will, But FortuneâAh she was unkind! My father, God save him, there toiled for his bread, Till age saw him tott'ring decay: Misfortune soon made me give up the dear shed, And forc'd me a soldier away! Of many a slaught'ring campaign I might tell, Where fame leads weak man to the field; Of many a battle, where brave comrades fell, For to death ev'n the bravest must yield! Now old, poor, and feeble, I beg at the spot, And mark the dear groves with a sigh; In vain have I sought the remains of my cot, Where grandeur but meets my dim eye! A nabob from India is lord of the hillâ A slave to his ill-gotten gold; But happier they tell me, is old beggar Will, Who nightly seeks shelter from cold: For he rests not, 'tis said; and each day at his gate, The wretched ask pity, in vain; But Will, in a barn, can sleep fearless of fate, Undisturbed by the wind or the rain. Tho' friendless, tho' wretched, why should I repine? A tear gives no comfort to me: If want be the only companion of mine, From that, death will soon set me free! Then stranger, I pray thee, a halfpenny spare, And Heav'n will a blessing bestow; For the heart that a beggar's distress loves to share, The greatest of pleasures must know! RED ROBIN. This song, with sonnets, &amp;c. was occasioned by a redbreast visiting for five years my retired apartment, in the centre of Carlisle. He commonly gave me his first cheerful strain in the beginning of September; and sang his farewell to the noise and smoke of the town in April. So tame was the merry minstrel, that he frequently made a hearty repast within a few inches of the paper on which I wrote. When business or pleasure led me from home, the food of my namesake was not forgotten: for sweeter to my ear was his evening song of gratitude, Than the fam'd organ's hoarsely-swelling note, Or labour'd concert, clamorously loud! Come into my cabin, Red Robin; Thrice welcome, blithe warbler to me; Now Skiddaw has thrown a white cap on, Again I'll gie shelter to thee: Come, freely hop into my pantry; Partake o' my plain wholesome fare; Tho' seldom I boast of a dainty, Yet mine man or bird shall ay share. Now five years are by-gane, Red Robin, Sin' first thou cam tremblin' to me; Alas! how I'm chang'd, little Robin, Sin' first I bade welcome to thee! I then had a bonny wee lassie; Awa' wi' anither she's gane: Then friens daily ca'd at my cabin, Now, dowie I seegh aw my lane. Wi' pleasure I view thee, Red Robin, Yet gaze wi' a pitying ee; Thy luik seems to say, like o'er monie, O' hunger puir Robin maun die! To think o' thy fate, houseless namesake, Just brings to mind what I maun bear; I meet wi' fause friens in ilk corner, And bow to the warl in despair. Tho' sweet are thy wild notes, Red Robin, They draw monie a tear frae my ee; They ca' to my mind youthfu' pleasures, When Mary sang sweetly to me: But pleasure aft gies way to sorrow, And pleasure leads millions to pain; Frae hope nae delights can I borrow, Life's comforts I wish for in vain. O where is thy sweetheart, Red Robin, Gae bring her frae house-tap or tree; I'll bid her be true to sweet Robin, For fause was a lassie to me: You'll share ev'ry crumb i' my cabin; We'll sing the wild winter away; I winna deceive ye, puir birdies, Let mortals use me as they may! ORPHAN BESS. Set to Music by Mr. Hook, and sung by Miss Leake, before the Royal Family, at Drury Lane Theatre. A poor helpless wand'rer, the wide world before me, When the harsh din of war forc'd a parent to roam; With no friend, save kind Heav'n, to protect and watch o'er me; I a child of affliction was robb'd of a home: And thus, with a sigh, I accosted each stranger, O look with compassion on poor Orphan Bess! Your mite may relieve her from each threat'ning danger, And the soft tear of pity can soothe her distress! To the rich, by whom virtue's too often neglected, I tell my sad story, and crave their relief; But wealth seldom feels for a wretch unprotected, 'Tis poverty only partakes of her grief! Ah! little they think, that the thousands they squander, On the play-things of folly, and fripp'ries of dress, Would relieve the keen wants of the wretched who wander, Whilst the soft tear of pity wou'd sooth their distress! Tho' bereft of each comfort, poor Bess will not languish, Since short is life's journey, 'tis vain to lament; And He who still marks the deep sigh of keen anguish, Hath plac'd in this bosom the jewel content. Then, ye wealthy, to-day, think, ah! think, ere tomorrow, The frowns of misfortune upon you may press; And turn not away from a poor orphan's sorrow; When the soft tear of pity can sooth her distress! THE HERO OF THE NILE. Shades of British naval worthies, Europe's dread and glo ry, Hawke, Howe, Duncan, Digby, Effingham, and Drake, Rooke, Rodney, Russel, Raleigh, Benbow, and Boscawen, Hardy, Keppel, Parker, Vernon, Kempenfelt, and Blake; High on the lists of fame your deeds shall live recorded, Protectors of old Albion, your envied happy Isle, But now Britannia sighing droops, and mourns a greater warrior, For fall'n is gallant Nelson, the Hero of the Nile. Soon as the fatal bullet laid low this pride of Britain, Neptune shook his hoary locks, and shrieks proclaim'd his grief; The dastard foemen loud rejoic'd, when down the seamen bore him, Each British tar shed tears for their long-lov'd matchless chief: Tho' soon they struck, and strike they must, while freedom warms a Briton, And commerce, arts, and industry make blest our far-fam'd Isle, Yet dear-bought is the victory when bleeds a nation's warrior, And long will future ages mourn the Hero of the Nile! To the scourges of mankind, the oppressors of their country, Let pride rear the column, bust, and splendid works of art; Our great immortal Nelson, still, still in quest of glory, Has left a lasting monument in ev'ry British heart: And while a vaunting enemy shall threaten us with slavery, Our tars for their country will meet death with a smile; Revenge will nerve each arm, whene'er they think of his bravery, Who fell our nations glory, the Hero of the Nile! TEDDY MâFANE. Tune,ââCairngorm Mountains.â Potatoes now blossom, and gladness prevails, The birds chaunt their love-songs throughout the green dales; But dull as an owl, I sit sighing all day; Och! what lass can be merry, now Teddy's away? Was it gold?âNo! not gold cou'd e'er force him to roam; He'd a grunter, a cow, aye and whiskey at home; And the love of the lasses might well make him vain, Tho' dearest was Judy to Teddy MâFane! I steal to his cabin, blind Darby to see; He cries, âArra, Judy! our Ted's far frae thee! He wou'd walk to England, his fortune to make, Wid a hod, or in hay-field; och! 'twas for thy sake!â I snatch up the pipes, the dear pipes of my Ted, And kiss them, and weep, for the music's all fled; Ne'er a boy in Kilkenny cou'd finger a strain, Or foot it away, like young Teddy MâFane! At morn or at eve, when I milk our one cow, I sing, âCruel Teddy! come to me, boy, do! From your own red-hair'd Judy, och! how cou'd you part? Some duchess will be after stealing your heart!â My old mother scolds in the corner, all day, Calls my cheeks white as linen, and fait, well she may! For they're bleach'd by my tears, like two spouts in the rainâ Arra! blow ye winds, bring to me Teddy MâFane! BEGGAR WILLY'S LAMENT. Tune,âBy the Author. The Norlan blast bla's o'er the hill, And day's last chearin' glimpse is gane; Alake! what waes my bosom fill, For hame or shelter I hae nane! Before me lies the trackless muir, Wi' monie a dang'rous wreath o' sna'; God only kens what I endure, Now night her curtain draws o'er a'. The wale o' pleasures ance were mine, And blithe was spent life's joyous morn; But age and puirtith now combine, To point me out ilk mortals scorn: The walthy drive me frae the gate; The puir but little can bestow; But I maun bear the ills o' fate, Till death shall end baith want and woe. I had a wife, but she's nae mair; I had a son, his father's pride; I had a cot, where ne'er ance care Durst seat him by our ingle side: Methinks I see my Johnny's smile; My age's hale delight was he! But wae betide the press-gang, vile, Wha forc'd the prop o' life frae me! We cheerfu' toil'd, wi' nought to fear, An' neebors, a', to baith were kind; My dim ee draps a painfu' tear, When tha'e blest days I ca' to mind! Yes! monie weel-lo'ed friens I fan, Wha pass me now unheeded by; E'en wee things mock the helpless man, An' weary o' the warl am I! Full fourscore Winters I hae seen, An' this may be auld Willy's last: But he wha hates a thought that's mean, Shou'd ne'er repine at what is past. The angry storm comes howling forth; I'll seat me 'neath this leafless tree; An' He wha rules the heav'n an' earth, May comfort hae in store for me! SUMMER. Tune,ââWhen the trees are all bare.â Now the gay smiles of Summer enliven each scene, And light is the breeze of the morn; Hills and meadows are cloth'd in their livery of green, And the blossoms the hedge-rows adorn: Panting herds seek the stream, and the flocks court the vale, While songsters enliven each spray; And the laugh of the rustic is borne on each gale. As with labour he cheats the long day. In this season, 'tis sweet, now when all is in bloom, The town and its follies to leave; And enjoy the pure breeze, orrich meadow's perfume, Where nature ne'er smiles to deceive: When at eve, tir'd with labour, the bee seeks his cell, A type of industry to man; And as Sol's parting beams tinge the mountain and dell, Fondly mark the Creator's great plan. While around as enraptur'd with ardour we gaze, Delighted each prospect to view, Let us think how soon manhood like Summer decays, But no mortal the past can renew: Then howe'er on life's journey its troubles we share, Let no pleasures the bosom beguile, Since 'tis wise to look forward, and daily prepare To give welcome to death, with a smile. JINGLE THE GLASSES. Tune,ââThe bragrie o't.â Come, Tom, let us jingle the glasses, lad, And bumper the dear witchin' lasses, lad; What tho' we baith be puir, We'll kick care behind the duir, And laugh at all dull thinkin' asses, lad! O had we been born to great plenty, lad, And of houses cou'd reckon'd up some twenty, lad, The warl wou'd beck'd and bow'd, But we'll bend not to the proud; For guid-fellowship thro' life's the greatest dainty, lad! Tho' the wise and the wealthy may jeer us, lad, We've ae comfort, nae hirelings need fear us, lad! Were my back without a coat, And my purse without a groat, Haith, I wadna change wi' thousands we see near us, lad! When we think o' the pleasures we hae tasted, lad, Shall we number the happy days as wasted, lad? No!âTho' youth's play be past, And auld age is postin' fast, By sorrow let no future joys be blasted, lad! If on decency's laws we ne'er trample, lad, But of virtue ay shew an honest sample, lad, A fig for a' the rules, And the pedantry o' fools! Wha the deil can say we set a bad example, lad! Then, Tom, let us jingle the glasses, lad, And laugh at half the warl, silly asses, lad! May we ay hae a friend, And a saxpence to spend, And a spare hour to sport wi' the lasses, lad! THE MANIAC. Yes, the maid I remember, who travers'd the wild, And sung her sad song near the old wither'd thorn; From her look, she e'en seem'd sorrow's fav'rite child, And a heart-rending burthen long time she had borne. âMan, base deceiver! come not near me! Ye artless maidens, do not fear me! Heed not men's vows; avoid their wiles; Oft sorrow lurks beneath love's smiles: But hush! the salt tear burns my cheekâ Ah! wounded heart, when wilt thou break?â Thus far she disclos'd, but by whoe'er undone, Or her name, not a sage village matron cou'd trace; Still the town and its throng she was careful to shun; But the trav'ller, with pity, wou'd gaze on her face: Each offer'd mite with scorn refusing; Now mild her looks, now reason losing; Now she'd laugh, now heave a sigh; Now chide the birds that near her fly; Now fancy wild flow'rs round her grow; And many a wreath she'd twine of straw. The loud storm of winter rag'd keen o'er the wild, When the corse of the poor shrivell'd Maniac was found; Ah! why not, ye wealthy, preserve sorrow's child? Compassion might heal many a wand'rer's deep wound! No rude stone marks her narrow dwelling; Perhaps once thought each maid excelling; She wish'd the stranger but to know, Love was the source of all her woe: How cautious still shou'd be the fair; Love leads to blissâlove leads to care. THE WILD ROSE. The wild Rose is a bonnie flow'r, When wat wi' mornin' dew; It ca's to mind the fair I prize, But, ah! she prov'd untrue! Her look a captive made my heart; She bound me wi' luive's chain: Yet I may taste o' liberty, Ere Roses bloom again. I'll pou the wild Rose, Flora's pride, And tear ilk thorn away; Then gie it to the lass I lo'e, She'll see it suin decay: At sic a sight she may relent, And ease me o' luive's pain; If sae, I'll thank ye, Roses wild, When first ye bloom again! TO MARY. Exil'd frae thee, and ilka mead, Where first I tun'd the rustic reed, Still fancy's aid I dare to crave; Still bend to love a willing slave. While others court life's gaudy crew, To empty grandeur fain to bow, The town nae mair can pleasure gie; My thoughts are center'd a' in thee. How monie a Spring hath deck'd the vales, And pour'd the fragrance on the gales, Sin' first by Sol's departin' beam, Midst Eden's bow'rs, love was our theme: Ah! hours o' bliss, to mem'ry dear! Ye prompt reflection's painfu' tear: Dear scenes! around ye brighter bloom, And will, till summon'd to the tomb! When Simmer wi' her smilin' train, Gars a' rejoice o'er hill and plain, I see thy face in ilka flow'r, And hear thy voice in monie a bow'r. When Boreas wi' a thousand storms The face o' nature quick deforms, I tune my pipe to love and thee, Till aft a tear-drap swells my ee. If musin' thro' the fields I stray, Thou'rt ay my theme the lee-lang day; And when the stars o' night appear, The thoughts o' thee my bosom cheer: In dreams I see thy matchless face, Enraptur'd wi' ilk magic grace; Thus day or night, thy charms impart The dearest bliss that warms my heart. Thy love is a' I ask on earth; It gies to ilka pleasure birth; Life's ills it maks me patient bear, Quite reckless o' the thorn o' care. Hope, wha sae aft fond man beguiles, Yet whispers wi' bewitchin' smiles, Tho' friendships fade, in life's decline, Long-wish'd-for joys may soon be mine! EVENING. How sweet 'tis to rove at the close of the day, O'er daisy-clad meads, by a soft murm'ring rill, When the thrush from the brake pours his evening love lay, And Sol's parting beams tinge the furze-cover'd hill; When the rustic's loud laugh tells a heart void of care, With the maid of his bosom delighted to roam; When eager the joys of his cottage to share, The labourer wearied, thinks long for his home. Now wrapt up in mist is the mountain's steep brow; No longer the din of the village is heard; Now lost is the landscape, late beauteous to view; No sound strikes the ear, save one sorrowful bird: 'Tis the partridge's wail, for his far-distant mateâ Let man learn affection from each feather'd pair, And reflect on the days he has spent, ere too late; Still thankful, midst sorrows, for blessings that were. In life's rosy morn, full of frolic and joy, Light-hearted, in quest of new pleasures we fly, Till noon brings its cares, many a hope to destroy, And the thoughts of the past will oft force a deep sigh: Eve steals on apace, and oft finds us in tears, For in friendship, in love, constant changes we see; Each wound of the heart deeper grows with our years, And the evening of life's seldom tranquil or free. TO NANNY. The subject of this song was servant to a respectable family, where the Author for some time resided, in Carlisle. She was an affectionate, beautiful girl, virtuous as beautiful, and rejoiced in the happiness of her fellow-creatures. Alas! poor Nanny, tho' she often listened to Robin's rhymes, forgot his instructions; for won by a harpy, who gloried in seduction, she sunk a prey to remorse, and was borne to the grave soon afterwards, deeply lamented. Tune,ââCrowdy.â Now, Nanny, in thy fifteenth year, Tak tent, an' listen my advice; Tho' thou canst boast nae lands or gear; Yet thou'lt hae wooers in a trice. But O, be wary! now's the time, When luive lurks in thy glancin e'e; Or thou'lt sup sorrow, ere thy prime, For man's a wretch, unknown to thee! A bonnier lip ne'er wan a heartâ A brighter e'e ne'er shot one thro' Thy cheek may match the fairest flow'r, That ever drank the e'ening dew: Yet, be thou wary! &amp;c. Let not puir Robin's humble praise Lift thee o'er high; the truth he'll tell: Sham fa' the loon, whase rhymin' phrase Maks onie lass forget hersel! Still be thou wary! &amp;c. Like bees aroun a hinny flow'r, They'll buz about thee, grin, and sing; But never let them steal thy sweets, Lest aff they fly, an' leave a sting. O lass, be wary! &amp;c. Sin' smoothest water's deepest found, Ay shun the slee pretendin' chiel; For he whase heart but harbours guile, Deserves a match wou'd match the Deil! Then, O be wary! &amp;c. Nor listen to the snivelin' fuil, Wha raves 'bout lightning, flames, and darts; Sic trash is learn'd in onie schuil, An' aft has broke the best o' hearts! Be wary, Nanny! &amp;c. Let simple nature be thy guide: Ay seek an honest heart to win; An' be the lad no' worth a groat, Tak courage, lass! the warl begin! But, O be wary! now's the time, When luive lurks in thy coal-black e'e; Or thou'lt sup sorrow, ere thy prime, For man's a wretch, unknown to thee! THE SHIP-WRECKED SEA-BOY. Tune,ââThe humours of Glen.â 'Tis nightâall around me the chill blast is howling; The harsh-screaming sea-bird now scar'd hovers nigh; The voice of great Heav'n in loud thunder is rolling: Alas! nor for shelter, nor rest can I fly! I mark by the lightning's blue gleam the wreck floating, Of her that long triumph'd o'er each threat'ning wave; I, alone, to this rock, 'scap'd the merciless ocean, While comrades, more blest, found a watery grave! More blest! 'Tis not so! If unpitied I perish, To me, some few hours for reflection are giv'n, A hope for the grey dawn of morning I'll cherish; We ne'er should arraign the decrees of Just Hfav'n! How still'd seems the tempest!âYon beauteous moon rising, I'll gaze on, awhile, my sunk spirits to cheer:â That sound! was it human?âagain hark!â'tis coming! Ah me!âthe wild half-famish'd wolf I but hear! My father, grown old!âmy affectionate mother! You'll look for poor Henry, but long watch in vain; My sister! how lovely!âmy helpless young brother! Ne'er, ne'er will you share my caresses again! With you, the long day will be spent in deep mourning; The bones of the sea-boy must bleach on the shore! Now dim grows my sight!âOh! this fever'd brain's burning! I come, welcome Death!âAll my sorrows are o'er! BRITANNIA'S CALL. Tune,âBy Mr. Hill. On a rock Britannia stood, And thus her warlike sons address'd; âShall a despot stain'd with blood, Warriors brave and free molest? No! rise to arms, and scorn the vengeful host; Death waits the foe who dares approach our coast. âHark! I hear the mighty dead, Cressy's fierce and godlike bandââ âBy your sires who boldly bled, Swear to save your native land; On, on to conquest! glory crowns the brave, Crush Gallia's tyrant who'd the world enslave!â âMatchless on the lists of fame, Vict'ry wreathes the Briton's brow; Nor shall they who boast the name To a foreign tyrant bow; For while his wrath on servile states is hurl'd, Britain shall rise the envy of the world.â THE LOVER'S TRIAL. âWho's that below my window calls, And breaks the silence of the night? Who wak'd me from my slumbers sweet, When dreaming of my soul's delight? Was it the night-breeze in the wood? Was it the streams that rapid flow? It seem'd the moan of shiv'ring want; It seem'd the hollow voice of woe!â â'Twas not the night-breeze in the wood: 'Twas not the streams that rapid flow: It was the moan of shiv'ring wantâ It was the hollow voice of woe: A houseless, helpless, friendless man, Implores your goodness with a sigh: Throw me a crust, for hunger craves, And with the cattle let me lie!â âIf pity e'er warm'd female breast, I feel the glow of pity here: Come, stranger, rest thy wearied limbs, And welcome share our humble cheer! The storm is up, the air is keen, The hour is late, the first cock crows; A blazing fire will give new life, And help to court thee to repose.â âThanks, lovely tender-hearted maid, Thy guest I'll sit till dawning day; And O, may Heav'n that knows thy worth, With plenty still such worth repay. Hear, Mary! hear a lover's voice, Who came to prove thy feeling heart; And by thy sighs in pity's cause, I swear we never more will part!â THE ROSE OF THE VALLEY. A rose of the valley, mid Cauda's green bowers, Bloom'd poor little Mary, the villagers' pride; And blithe as the lark that elate hails the morning, O'er scenes of blest childhood with health daily hied: Her father, a cottager, lov'd her, ah, dearly! For still in her face a lost partner he view'd, And oft to her green grave at evening they wander'd, To pluck the wild weeds Spring around it had strew'd. Now scarce sixteen Summers had danc'd o'er the mountains, When love, tyrant love made poor Mary his slave; But soon slaught'ring war from her arms call'd young Henry, And tidings next told her he fell with the brave. All faded she wanders, each comfort denying, The visions of pleasure for ever are fled; A poor frenzied orphan lives ill-fated Mary, The flocks her companions, the cold earth her bed. MARY. Tune,ââGuid night and joy be wi' ye a'.â The Summer sun was out of sight, His parting beams danc'd on the flood; The fisher watch'd the silver fry, As in the stream he bending stood; The blackbird mourn'd departing day, And call'd his partner to his nest, When I up Eden took my way, To meet my Mary I love best. I gaz'd upon her matchless face, That fairer than the lily seem'd; I mark'd the magic of her eye, That with love's pow'rful lightning beam'd; I saw her cheek of beauteous red, That, blushing, told a lover's pain, Then stole a kiss; if 'twas a crime, Ye gods, oft may I sin again! Fast flew the hours, now rose the moon, And told us it was time to part; I saw her to her mother's door, She whisper'd low, âthou hast my heart!â I thro' the lattice stole a glance, And heard her angry mother chide; Then thought of all a parent's cares, As from the cot I homeward hied. I've tasted pleasures, dearly bought, And read mankind in many a page; But woman, woman sweeten's life, From giddy youth to feeble age! Ye worldlings court coy fortune's smile; Ye rakes in quest of pleasure rove; Ye drunkards drown each sense with wine; Be mine the dear delights of love! WILL O' THE GLEN. When lav'rocks were singin', and gowans were springin', Young Will o' the Glen cam a wooin' to me! My heart how it panted, he sought me, 'twas granted, For Willy was a' a fond wooer sould be: Far dearest o' onie, was he to his Annie; I gied him my hand, tho' my tocher was sma'; Scarce pleasures we tasted, ere hopes were a' blastedâ War forc'd my sad Willy to wander awa'. Three lang years were over, and I for my lover, In simmer, in winter, did naething but mourn; I droop'd like a lily, nor e'er hop'd my Willy To friens or his partner again would return: To-day sunk in sadness, to-morrow brings gladness, Ae night by the hallan, I heard a voice ca', âCome kiss me, my Annie! I'm happiest o' onie; And nae mair thy Willy will wander awa'.â The pride o' his neebors, he laughs, and he labours; Wi' twa rosy weans, I sing at my wheel; At e'enin' we meet him, they kiss him, and greet him, And ay his delight is to see us a' leel: While monie hunt treasure, my Willy's hale pleasure Is, that health rules his cottage, and smiles on us a'; We'll toil on thegethir, and comfort ilk ither, In hopes to be ready, when death gies us a ca'! THE COTTAGE GIRL. FROM THE MUSICAL FARCE OF THE BEGGAR GIRL. Tune,âBy the Auther. On the brow of a hill where the stream gurgles down, With a church within sight stands my cottage of clay; I rise with the lark, and no lady in town, By splendour surrounded, spends sweeter the day: The thorn of ambition ne'er wounded my breast, If I gaze at fine gentry, I envy them not; In plain russet gown, pride disturbs not my rest, For innocence dwells with content in my cot. Tho' lowly it seems, 'twas my forefather's pride, The scene of fond youth, where they wanton'd with mirth; And the woodbine and jess'mine that creep up its side, On that morning were planted which smil'd at my birth: My parents, tho' poor, cou'd avoid envious strife, And ne'er shall their lessons by me be forgot; Then welcome, ye rich, to the play-things of life, You know not the pleasures that wait on the cot! My shepherd is constant, and O what delight I feel, when at eve he returns from the plain; As peace crowns the day, love beguiles many a night, And care and rough weather attack us in vain. When spring time invites, o'er the daisy-clad meads, The linnet sings sweet, and cold winter's forgot; Then who for a court, or a few silken weeds, Wou'd barter retirement, content, and a cot. THE KIRK-YARD YEW. Tune,âBy the Author. I ance lo'ed a lass, a bonny sweet lass, And pawky her een were, and blue; She lo'ed me as weel as she lo'ed her ain brither, And monie a time vow'd she cou'd ne'er like anither; And leel was her heart, and true. I gaed to the south, a sad sorrowfu' gate, The journey, thro' life, I may rue; Five years brought me hame, wi' a pain'd bosom burning, Alake! a' my hopes were soon, soon chang'd to mourningâ She laid near the Kirk-yard Yew! I ran to the grave o' this blossom sae fair, As the flow'rs sipp'd the mild e'ening dew; A tear dimm'd my e'e, and I aft said wi' sorrow, Sweet lassie! I fain wou'd rest near thee to-morrow, In peace, near the Kirk-yard Yew! Ne'er, ne'er maun I ken sic a lassie again, While this dark vale of life I toil thro'; Her name I'll ay treasure, where'er fate may thraw me, And a tear afttimes gie her, whate'er may befa' meâ Sweet lass, near the Kirk-yard Yew! THE LAND WE LIVE IN. SUNG BY MR. MAYWOOD, ON ST. PATRICK'S DAY. Tune,ââDaintie Davie.â Apologies shall sangsters use? Wae worth the loon wha dare refuse; I'll chaunt ane aff-hand frae the Muse, And praise the land we live in: Wi' beauty fair as flow'rs o' spring, An' lads mair blithe than onie king, Deil claw his wame wha winna sing The favour'd land we live in! Gae seek auld terra firma round, Whare'er man claims a perch o' ground, The leelest hearts will ay be found, Throughout the land we live in! Auld Erin's cottars laugh at care; They lo'e their friens, protect the fair; And grievous ills they joyfu' bear, A' for the land they live in! Their bosoms wi' true valour steel'd, They're ay the foremost i' the field; And mak ilk pauky Frenchman yield, For the dear land they live in! Gae seek auld terra firma, &amp;c. Whare'er I earn my wee bit bread, Howe'er stern fate may bow my head, I'll sing, till number'd wi' the dead, This happy land we live in! And O, while shamrock's deck the isle, May peace and plenty on it smile; And bonny lasses, void o' guile, Ay grace the land we live in! Gae seek auld terra firma, &amp;c. Now, strike the harpâyour voices raise, In Erin'sâin St. Patrick's praise; May sorrow darken a' his days, Wha scorns the land we live in! May party feuds for ever cease, An' rights religious lang encrease! Then, bold in war, secure in peace, We'll bless the land we live in! Gae seek auld terra firma round, Whare'er man claims a perch o' ground, The leelest hearts will ay be found, Throughout the land we live in! TO MARY. Wintry blasts nae langer bla'; Spring returns wi' smilin' face; Mountains cast their caps o' sna', Nature shews ilk pleasin' grace: Now, Mary, quit thy cot sae dear, And love, true love, shall be our theme, As pleas'd we mark the changin' year, Where wild woods wave o'er Eden's stream. Linnets court on ilka bush; Lavrocks soar abuin the lea; Loudest o' the lave, the thrush, Cheers his mate frae tree to tree: O'er hill and moor, in mead or bow'r, Ilk joy's to mak fond love a theme; Like them, we'll pass the e'enin' hour, Where wild woods wave o'er Eden's stream. Blest wi' thee, nought mair I'll prize; Suin will hasten life's decline, Dead'nin' a' our earthly joys; âSay, to-morrow thou'lt be mine! I swear by that consentin' smile, To think o' this delightfu' theme! Here beats a heart shall ne'er know guile, While wild woods wave o'er Eden's stream! CRAZY KATE. Set to Music by Mr. Hook, and sung by Mr. Incledon, at Covent-Garden Theatre. Ah! who is she whose tresses wild, Bespeak her sorrow's frantic child? 'Tis Kate, whose bosom fraught with woe, Sweet peace again can never know; Who, careless, wandering all day long, Sings to herself this plaintive song:â âCome Death! thou friend to the distrest, Srike, strike, at once, this tortur'd breast, And ease poor Kate, who cannot rest!â In infancy, her father died: And she, her mother's only pride, Was forc'd (hard fate!) at plenty's door The mite of pity to implore. But soon, ah! soon an orphan left; Of ev'ry stay, save Heaven, bereft; In coarsest tatters but half-drest, Without a home or place of rest, The little roamer liv'd distrest. Alas! that on life's thorny way, There are who virtue will betray: For in her youth, Kate lov'd too well, And soon to love a victim fell! Now robb'd of reason, all day long, The wand'rer sings her plaintive song:â âCome Death! thou friend to the distrest, Strike, strike, at once, this tortur'd breast, And ease poor Kate, who cannot rest!â THE CASTLE BUILDER. Tune,âBy the Author. âI'll build a high house, on this hill, says old Grub, Where house never stood before; A man like Goliah shall stand at my gate, And drive far away all the poor, With a bang! Wise men agree that the rabble are better of a good sound beating, and all that. Yes! the beggars he'll keep from my door! âMy eldest son, Tom, shall prime minister be; Soon Will shall the army lead: My daughter shall give to Lord Simple her hand; I'm rich, and am sure to succeed, Worth a plum! First man on change! Safe! Snug in the last loan! A speculator in hops, cotton, and all that! Yes! I'm rich, and must therefore succeed! âI'll level yon mountain, and dig a large lake, Where navies in safety may ride; Then fill it with all the choice fish of the sea, And angle in punt by the side; Charming sport! Catching salmon, sprats, trout, turbot, mackerel, and minnow; under rocks, woods, cascades, and all that! While I smoke in my punt, by the side! âYon cottages, too, must be all clear'd away, And so shall the old thatch'd mill; The alms-house I'll soon to a dog-kennel turn; The poor may e'en go where they will, What care I! Must have parks, deer, meads, flocks, groves, and all that! Yes! the poor may e'en starve where they will! âOn the right of my house, a church like St. Paul's, On the left, a castle I'll plan; That the gentles may say, as they travel that way, See the works of a marvellous man! Blest retreat! River stealing away unheard, and scarce seen! Gardens laid out in old Dutch style! Trees cropped; pleasure box in front; Apollos, Dragons, Cupids, Mermaids, and all that! These are works of a marvellous man! âThen the neighbours around I'll frighten with law, Till all near me, worth having, is mine; Shou'd a clown shoot a hare, I'll confine him for life, None but fools will to mercy incline! Let him rot! Must shew authority; punish poachers; preserve game, and all that: Yes! fools may to mercy incline!â Now old Grub hobbl'd home, and smok'd a long pipe, And bottom'd a mug of small beer; Then went to his bed; soon the grim spectre, Death, Cut him off in his crazy career: All was done! What avails house, porter, power, cash, hops, cotton, lake, fish, rocks, woods, punt, kennel, parks, deer, meads, flocks, groves, church, castle, river, trees, Apollos, dragons, cupids, lands, game, pipe, beer, and all that! Unless we do good whilst we're here! From the prince to the peasant, in every state, What Grubs do we daily see! May his castles endure who feedeth the poor; After death he rewarded will be: Yes, he will! We are told, âHe who giveth to the poor, lendeth to the Lord.â Yes! rewarded he surely will be! FAREWELL TO GILSLAND. Adieu, ye dun heaths, purple vales, and wild flowers, Ye banks whose proud steeps in green verdure are drest; Ye walks, and ye woodlands, ye glades, and cool bowers, In whose retir'd shades oft the wearied find rest. To the town and its follies, fate calls me away; But reluctant and sad I the summons obey. Adieu, ye grey crags, and thou hoarse-murm'ring river, Whose sounds, heard afar, lull the mind to repose; Near thee could I dwell in retirement, and ever On thy wood-fring'd windings forget all my woes: There, free from temptation, unknown would I live, And taste the delights only virtue can give. And thou source of health, whose clear waters still flowing, Faint tppe of His bounty who governs this ball; New vigour, new life, to the wretched bestowing, Long may thy blue streams pour their healing to all; And thy rock be the seat of contentment and mirth, While peace, love, and virtue are cherish'd on earth. HODGE AND THE SQUIRE. FROM THE MUSICAL FARCE OF THE BEGGAR GIRL. Tune,âBy the Author. Says our Squire, âHodge, tell me, young shepherd swain, Wilt thou leave thy flock, thy cottage, and plain, In London great wealth and honours to gain, And all fine sights to see?â âAh, no! by your leave, my good Sir,â said I, âWe're told, those who carry their heads too high, Spend comfortless days, and on thorns oft lie; But content still dwells with me!â Says our Squire, âI'll dress thee in clothing fine; Thou on ev'ry choice dainty with me shalt dine; Lac'd servants shall hand thee each costly wine; Think, clown, what honour 'twill be!â âIn home-spun coat, I can merrily sing: O'er my humble meal, I'm great as a king, And when thirsty, I hie to the chrystal spring, Where content still waits on me!â Says our Squire, âRich dames thou shalt court at play, Where music drives ev'ry dull care away; Then while the sun shines, young shepherd, make hay; Come now or never!â quoth he. âAt the dance on the green when the sun goes down, With my Phillis, I envy not those in town; Nor Phillis I'd leave, for a monarch's crown, For content guards her and me! âGo, take your dames, wealth, wine, and shows! From care can you purchase an hour's repose? Each neighbour's my friend; I know no foes; And smile at poverty. 'Tis my wish to inhabit yon humble shed, Where my forefathers honestly earn'd their bread; And whenever misfortune bows down my head, May content then dwell with me!â THE VALE OF TEARS. Yes! there are pleasures some ne'er know, And there are pains too many prove; And bliss is oft the source of woe, Ev'n when it springs from virtuous love. Hope, fair deceiver, Lures us for ever! Sweet her smiles in life's gay morn; But, ah! her roses, Reason shews us, Hide full many a cank'ring thorn. We toil for wealth, we seek for fame, And various phantoms we pursue: This oft brings care, that's but a name; At last reflection whispers true.â âPoor murmuring creature, Weak by nature, Swell'd by hopes, oppressed by fears; Proud and ungrateful, Vain, deceitful, Man makes life a Vale of Tears!â TO MARY. On thy banks, chrystal Eden, my dear native river! In youth, and in manhood, rejoicing I've stray'd; Tho' fertile thy meads, they so beauteous seem'd never, Till straying with Mary, the dear witching maid: 'Twas eve's sober hour, and all silent was near us, Save the redbreast's last note, or the hoarse-sounding stream; Free from the proud city, no sland'rer to hear us, The minutes flew sweetly, for love was the theme. On thy banks, winding Eden, a fond look she gave me, Enraptur'd, I saw the keen glance of her eye; Each grace, word, or smile, was enough to enslave me, And thoughts of such moments now prompt the deep sigh: Far, far did we saunter, till night drew her curtain, 'Twas hard with such beauty, such goodness to part; However thro' life I'm the sport of frail fortune, Still Mary, I swear, will be dear to my heart! Let grey-beards and fools laugh at love and at pleasure, Their dull fusty maxims I ever despise; Let worldlings court riches, and bow to their treasure, Be woman my idol; dear woman I prize! Tho' oft on life's journey, abandon'd to sorrow, When love's divine transports with beauty I share, I scorn the hard world, and the threats of to-morrow, The smile of the virtuous dispels every care! THE CAPTAIN'S LADY. Tune,ââO'er the muir amang the heather.â âLassie wi' the coal-black locks, Wilt thou be a captain's lady? Quat bare mountains, glens, and flocks, Heed nae mam, or canker'd daddy. Hie wi' me o'er Scotia's hillsâ By this sword, nae loon shall harm thee; Thy sweet luik my bosom fillsâ Let nae sodger e'er alarm thee!â âStranger, ware nae words on me, I'd no' be a captain's lady; For the gowd o' Chrissendie, I'd no' lea' my feeble daddy! Grey wi' years, bow'd down wi' pain, Jean's his hale delight and treasure; In rude cot we envy nane, Thae wild glens ay gie us pleasure.â âLassie, dinna turn awa'; Suin in costly gear I'll deck thee, Big for thee a house mair bra', Mistress o' the hale I'll mak thee: Thou shalt see the auld folk blest; I'll protect 'em frae ilk danger; Age and puirtith ay lack restâ Dinna frown upo' the stranger!â âNear yon kirk my mither's laid, Tears o' sorrow I shed o'er her; Your red coat and bra' cockade, Ca' to mind ane I lost for her; Dear he lo'ed me, sought my hand; Mair I priz'd my mam and daddy; Suin far frae his native land, They slew my faithfu' shepherd laddie!â âThy bright e'e's dimm'd wi' a tear, Mine, to see it, sheds anither; By the pearly draps, I swear, Happy days we'll pass thegether, I'm thy ain blithe shepherd lad, Rich, and hale, and honest-hearted: Haste, let's mak a parent glad, And may we ne'er again be parted.â THE AUTHOR ON HIMSELF. I long have drank of pleasure's cup, And oft have been the son of pain; And I have tasted friendly joys, That I must never share again: For time hath now my forehead bared, And cherish'd hopes, all, all are fled; I cannot soothe another's woes, Or dry the tear by sorrow shed! Cold Poverty, with haggard look, Now threatens sore, in life's decline; And Friendship wears another garb; And Love's delights no more are mine. Night comes not, now, with dreams of bliss; I chide the slow approach of day; Reflection causes painful sighs; And I could weep the hours away! THE FAIR-HAIR'D MAID. When wearied bees with laden thighs Humm'd, slowly wheeling tow'rds their cell; When eve's blue mists began to rise, And all was silence in the dell: Where Eden's streams are heard afar, And willows weave a shade, I left the town, rejoic'd to meet My blooming, smiling, fair-hair'd Maid. I gaz'd, but feign'd a woe-worn lookâ âMy Mary, dear!â I sigh'd âAdieu! To-morrow in the badge of war, I leave thee to some one more true!â In vain she tried her grief to hide, I saw her colour fade; She sunk, a lily at my feet, The faithful, tender, fair-hair'd Maid. Anxious, I saw her soon revive, And clasp'd her to my panting heart; âThis falsehood, Mary, O forgive! And mark the tear love bids to start: To-morrow wilt thou be my own?â âAh! canst thou doubt?â she said, We hail'd the long-wish'd happy hourâ She's mine, the matchless fair-hair'd Maid! ADDRESSED TO MR. WM. BELL, OF GILSLAND, W. M. AND THE BRETHREN OF ST. MICHAEL'S LODGE, BRAMPTON. Tune,ââLet care be a stranger to each jovial soul.â Since to serve a poor Cumbrian Bard is your plan, Let gratitude shew the great duty of man; Around you may health, love, and cheerfulness reign, And those who scorn pleasure, still scorn to give pain: That good men are equal, all wise men declare, From the prince to the peasant, each bows to dull care; To get rid of that pest, keep this maxim in view, Still do unto others, as you'd be done to! While our master delighteth, nor seeks to betray, May the day-star of hope never lead him astray; While to draw man from folly, his mind's nobly bent, May the master and brethren still harbour content: Improv'd, rul'd by masonry's truths, void of art, When death gives the summons, we'll cheerfully part; Till then, let us all keep this maxim in view, To do unto others, as we'd be done to! Then join heart and hand, and unite in one voice, To pray for each mason, his brethrens' proud choice; May each brother be blest with wealth, freedom, and peace, And the rights of all sects, and all parties increase! Ah! happy the day, when to mortals was giv'n, Of all Institutions, the first under Heav'n! By this, we can keep the grand maxim in view, And do unto others, as we'd be done to!</field>
