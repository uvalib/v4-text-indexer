Whom Heauen with all Choise Graces hath endow'd, Whom both the Angels praise, and men admire: On whom her Maker hath his bounty show'd, Where nothing wants that mortall can desire. Whose beauties are as farre beyond compare, As are her inward vertues of the mind, But in that height vnmatchably so rare We on the Earth her equall cannot finde. Her Parents Ioy, the Peeres selected pleasure, The peoples admiration, Kingdomes wonder, Of forraine climes the praise, of ours the treasure, May this daies sacred vnion neuer sunder. That whilst we daily of high Heauen importune, We may be in your Royall issue blest: You may still grow in bewtie, vertue, fortune, So with your fame our ioyes may be increast. Proue thou a Prophet, Muse, say t'is decreed, All Christendome shall florish in your seed. Your Graces most humbly deuoted, Thomas Heywood. An Epithilamion, OR NVPTIALL SONG. CONSECRATED TO THE HAPPY MEMORY OF THE ROYAL AND MAGNIFICENT Espousals betwixt the High and Mighty Prince Fredericke the Fift, Count Palatine, Duke of Bauaria, Prince Elector to the Empire, &amp;c. and Knight of the most Honourable Order of the Garter; and the most Excellent, and euery-way accomplished Princesse the Lady Elizabeth, sole daughter to the High and most Puissant Iames, by the grace of God, King of Great Brittaine, France, and Ireland, &amp;c. Defender of the Faith, and the most Vertuous, and Admirable Lady, Queene Anne. Novv the wet Winter of our teares are past, And see, the cheerefull Spring appeares at last, Now we may calculate by the Welkins racke Æolus hath chaste the Clouds that were so blacke: And th' are beyond the Hiperboreans runne That haue so late eclipst Great Brittaines Sonne. O thou my Muse, that whilome maskt in sable, Exclaiming on the fates and chance vnstable, Accusing Phisicke, and her want of skill, And Natures hard-heart, that her owne would kill: On Death, and his fell tyranny exclaiming, Chance, Fortune, Destiny, and all things blaming; Inueighing against howres, daies, months, and time, That cropt so sweet a blossome in his prime. Against Mortality, that could not saue So choyce a Gemme from th' all-deuouring graue; But most against the cause, Brittaines Transgressions, That so soone cal'd him to that heauenly Sessions. Where from this earthy Mansion being translated, He now for ay remaines a Prince instated. No more let vs our ancient griefes pursue, Or the swift torrent of our teares renue. No more let vs with clamors fill the sky. Or make th' heauens eccho to each dole full cry. No more disturbe his soft sleepe, since 'tis best We wake him not from his eternall rest. Yet who could blame my Muse, that did lament To see so faire a branch, so rudely rent From such a stately, and broad-bearing tree, That might haue borne like fruit? For who to see So rich a treasure in a moment wasted, Such goodly fruit, not fully ripe, yet blasted, So rich a roab, so soone dispoild as worne, Such generall hopes destroid as soone as borne, But with impartiall iudgements must confesse, No Muse, that can sing, but could shrieke no lesse? Those that loue day, must thinke it much too soone, To see the glorious Sunne to set at noone. And none but such as hate the cherefull light, (Murderers and Theives) at mid-day wish it night Is it because we breake the Gods decree, That Tantalus we are punisht like to thee: Thou that their secrets durst presume to tell, Art with perpetuall hunger plagu'd in hell, Yet sundry delicates before thee stand, Which thou maist reach, not c?passe with thy hand. So haue the Gods dealt with vs, for some crime, To let vs see the glory of our time, As a faire marke, at which the world might gaze, And put the wondring Nations in a maze. But as we stretch our hands to reach our ioy, They snatch it hence, and all our hopes destroy. But now my Muse, shake off this gloomy sorrow, And a bright saffron roab from Hymen borrow. Thou that before in Rauens plumes didst sing, Now get thee feathers from the Swans white wing, And take an equall flight with Venus Doues, To tune soft layes of Nuptials, and sweet Loues. For now me thinkes I youthfull Tython see, The day Aurora, that he married thee. The expected howre was come, the Matrons shine In glistring roabes; th' old men, as if Diuine, Apparreld in rich purple; them betweene, The sprightly Youths, and beauteous Nymphes are seene. At length the blushing Bride comes with her haire Disheuel'd 'bout her shoulders; none so faire In all that Beuie, though it might appeare, The choycest beauties were assembled there. She enters with a sweet commanding grace, Her very presence paradic'd the place: Her modest blush amongst the Ladies spred And cast on all their Cheekes a shame-fast red. How could they chuse, their looks that seeme diuine Before she came, eclipst are at her shine? They all are darkned when she 'gins t'appeare, And spread her beames in her Illustrious spheare: All eyes are fixt on her, the youthfull fry, Amazed stand at her great Maiesty. The Nymphs and Maids, both enuy and admire Her matchlesse beauty, state, and rich attire. The grauer Matrons stand amaz'd with wonder, The Fathers, as if strooke with Ioues sharpe thunder Confounded are, as neuer hauing seene In their long trace of yeares, so faire a Queene. Not Hecuba, when Priam came to Thrace, To court her for his Queene, could giue the place Such ornament: not Spartan Hellen knew, To attire her person in a forme so true. Had Perseus in his airy progresse spide This picture to the marble rocke fast tide, For her he would haue fought, and as a pray To the Sea-monster, left Andromeda. Had Paris seene her, he had nere crost the flood, Hellen had beene vnrapte, Troy still had stood. Had Thetis sonne beheld her when he saw Polyxena, nothing should him with-draw From dreadfull battle: he had shin'd in steele, And not vnarm'd beene wounded in the heele. Had Iuno, Venus, or Minerua, when They stroue for maistery, seene this Lady, then As vanquisht, they had left to her the Ball, Which from his starry throne great Ioue let fall. But wherefore on her glories doe I dwell, Whose state my Muse vnable is to tell? To a bright Iuory Chaire the Bride they bring, VVhilst all the people Io Pæan sing. Now see from forth another stately Arch, Of the great palace, the braue Bride-groome march, A louely youth, vpon whose face appeares True signes of man-hood; yet he for his yeares And beauty, such a generall name hath wonne, They take him all, for Venus, or her sonne. A mixed grace he in his visage wore, And but his habit shewd what sex hee bore The quickest sighted eye might haue mistooke, Hauing female beauty in a manly looke. Such lustre in Adonis cheeke did move, VVhen he was haunted by the Queene of loue: So look't Hypolitus when clad in greene, He was oft Courted by th' Athenian Queene. Such grace Hypomanes in publike wan, That day he with the swift Atlanta ran. So shin'd Perithous amongst the rest, VVhen mongst the Centaurs Ioues son grac't the feast. Such seem'd th' Idean sheepheard in the eye Of faire Oenone, when she saw him lye Vpon a Violet banke: Such did appeare Yong Itis, vnto Galatea deere. Such Ciparissus seem'd, so sweete so faire, For whom Apollo left his fiery Chaire. A curious Roabe athwart his shoulders fell, By some laborious hand Imbroidered well: Cunning Arachne could no better weaue, Nor Pallas, should the heauens she once more leaue: The colour was of Elementall blew Spotted with golden Starres: heere Comets flew With blazing trains, some great appeard, some smal, Some were so wrought that they might seeme to fal, And shooting towards the earth as darting fire, Euen in their hottest fury did expire: Yet in their golden course the way they went, They seemed to guild the Azure Firmament. You might in this discoulered Roabe perceiue The Galaxia a more brightnesse leaue Then th' other parts of heauen, because so faire Cassiopeia spreads her glistering haire. There the quicke-sighted Eagle shines, and Swanne, And the Argoe that the Fleece of Colchos wanne. Sagitarius threats the Scorpion to haue slaine, Who gainst him shakes his poysonous starry traine. With six bright lamps doth the bold C?taure stand, Threatning the Twins, who hold in euery hand Bright bals of fire, eighteene they be in number, That if the Centaur stir, his force to cumber. The Northen Waggoner stands next in roll, Wh? Perseus with his Shield, frights 'bout the Pole. The wandring Sporades 'mongst these appeare, Which makes the Galaxia shine more cleere Then the other parts of heauen, this Thetis wrought And as a present to the Bridegroome brought: For who could place them in there rancks more true Then she, that euery night takes a full view (From top of Neptunes Tarras) how they stand, How moue, rise, set, or how the Seas command? This Mantle doth the Bride-groomes body graspe Buckled about him with a golden claspe. And as when Lucifer lifts from the waues His glorious head, the Stars about him braues, Who when he moues his sacred front on high, Seeme in their (almost wasted) oile to die, And giue him all the glory; with a Crest As bright as his appeares amongst the rest. This louely Youth: with many a comely stride Hee preaceth towards the place where sits his Bride, Then bowes to her, she blusheth as he bends And honors low, his faire hand he extends To ceaze her Iuory Palme, which as he warmes, Shee breathes into him many thousand charmes Of loues, affections, zeale, cordiall desires, Chast wishes, pleasures, mixt with deepe suspires, Passions, distractions, extasies, amazes, All these he feeles, when on her eies he gazes: Till further boldned by a blushing smile, He leaues his trance, and she discends the while Yet was all silence, till at this glad close, Through all the place, a whispering murmure rose: Some his perfection, some her beauty praise, And both aboue the highest degree would raise To exceed all comparison, some sweare Two such bright Comets, neuer grac't that Spheare, And as they walke the Virgins strow the way With Costmary, and sweete Angelica. With Spyknard, Margerom, and Camomile, Time, Buglosse, Lauender, and Pimpernell, Strawbery leaues, Sauory; and Eglantine With Endiue, Holy-thistle, Sops in Wine, Smallage, Balme, Germander, Basell and Lilly, The Pinke, the Flower-de-luce and Daffadilly, The Gilliflowre, Carnation, white and red, With various spots and staines enameled, The Purple Violet, Paunce, and Hearts-ease, And euery flower that smell, or sight, can please: The yellow Marigold, the Sunnes owne flower, Pagle, and Pinke, that decke faire Floraes Bower, The Dasie, Cowslip, Wal-flower, Columbine; VVith the broad-leaues late cropt from Bacchus vine, Besides a thousand other fragrant poses Of Wood-bine, Rosemary, and sundry Roses: Next in their way, some pretious garments strow, Some scatter-gold wrought Arras where they go: Others before them costly presents cast, Of Iuory, Corrall, and of Pearle: the last Bring Gold and Iewels: one presents a Crowne Vnto the Bride, and giues it as her owne. Diuers contend where this rich mettall grew, In Phillipine, in Ophir, or Peru: Or the Malluccoes: this a Carcanet Bestowes, with pretious stones of all kind set Of luster and of beauty, here was found The hardest, and most quicke, the Diamond, The Ruby, of a perfect light and life, The Saphir and the Emerald, at strife, Which can expresse vnto the eie more true, The one a grasse-greene, th' other perfect blew, Heere the discoloured Opal faire did shine, And Onix deepe, dig'd from the Rocky Mine, The Topas which, some say, abides the fire, And Sardonix; what is he can desire A stone that's wanting as they walke along The Batchelers, and Virgins with this Song Tun'd to their aprest Instruments, thus greete Their Nuptiall Ioyes, with strings and voyces sweete. The Epithilamion. You fairest of your sexes how shall we Stile you, that seeme on earth to be diuine, Vnlesse the Musicall Apollo hee, And shee the fairest of the Muses nine, Not Daphne turn'd into a Lawrel-tree So bright could bee So faire, so free Not Ariadne crown'd so cleere can shine. Can Venus yoaked Swannes so white appeare? Or halfe so louely when you two embrace? Are not his parts admired euery where, His sweete proportion, feature, shape, and face? Or like her Iris in her arched Spheare, Or Hebe cleere To Iuno neere? To match this Lady in her comely grace. VVhy should we these to Venus Doues compare, Since in blancht whitenes, they their plumes exceed, Or to the Alpine Mountaines, when they are Cloth'd in Snow, since monstrous beasts they breed VVhy should we to white marble pillers dare Set two so faire In all things rare, Since saue disgrace comparisons nought breed. Vnto your selues, your selues, then we must say, VVe onely may compare: Heauen, Sea nor Earth Can parralell the vertues euery way; Your names, your stiles, your honors, and your birth On to the Temple then, why do we stay? Vse no delay, Loose no more day, By this blest vnion adde vnto our mirth. Charis that strewes faire Venus Couch with flowers Ioyne with the other graces to attend you, The Muses and their Influence to your dowres, Angels and Cherubs from all ills defend you, The Gods into your laps raigne plenteous showres, All heauenly powers Adde to your howers, Heauens graces, &amp; earths guifts that may commend you. Minerua, that of Chastity hath care, And Iuno that of marriage takes regard, The happy fortunes of these two prepare, And let from them no comforts be debar'd, Blesse them with Issue, and a Royall Heyre, Lucina faire, Let one so rare In all her future thro's be gently hard. Proue thou faire fortune in thy bounties free Be all the happiest Seasons hence-forth showne Temperate and calme, and full of mirthfull glee, All ioyes and comforts challenge as your owne, VVhat grace and good wee can but wish to bee, May You and Shee As heauens agree. Inioy in your most happy prosperous Crowne, So shall the Swaynes and Nymphs choice presents bring, VVith yeerely offering to this sacred shrine So shall our Annuall festiues praise the Spring, In which, two plants of such great hope combine, For euer this bright day eternizing, Timbrels shall ring VVhilst we still sing O Hymen, Hymen, be thou still diuine. But whether am I carried, if such State Yong Tython and Aurora celebrate: VVhat shall be then at this vniting done? Since in his noone-tide progresse, the bright Sunne Hath neuer seene their Equals? what blest muse Shall I inuoke, or whose assistance vse? VVhat accent, in what number, or what straine? Shall I the weakenesse of my skill complaine? Oh were I by the cleere Begasian Fount, VVhich Perseus Steed made, when he gan to Mount, VVhere his heele stroke, first grew the sacred VVell, By which Ioues daughters, the nine sisters dwell: Or were I laid in Aganippes Spring, VVhere Pellas oft discends to heare them sing: Or might I come to wash my Temples cleane, In the pure drops of learned Hypotrene: I might haue then some hope to be inspired, And mount the height I haue so long desired: Yet howsoe're, I will presume to sing And foare according to my strength and wing, Then now, ô Hymen don thy brightest weed That all things may successiuely succeed At these high Nuptials, spread thy golden haire, And let no spot vpon thy Robes appeare, No wrinckle in thy front, which may presage The least sad chance, as at the marriage Of Orpheus and Euridice, when thou Wor'st stormes and tempests in thy angry brow. Or when the father of the two Atrides, Or their bold sonnes, contracted first their Brides. Or when Minerua's Champion Diomed, That wounded Venus in the hand, was sped; For which the Goddesse curst him, and then sware To leaue his bed adulterate without heire. Or when King Ceix with Alcione met, When at the Nuptiall table thou wast set, Thou wouldst not lend the feast one gentle smile, But discontentedly sat'st all the while. Nor as when first the Troian sheepheard tooke Oenone, and soone after her forsooke O put not on that habit thou then wore, VVhen first faire Phedra to Duke Theseus swore! But bring with thee that bright and cheerefull face, As when Alcest, Admetus did imbrace. Chaste Alcest, who to keepe him from the graue, Offred her life, her husbands life to saue. Not Portia, whom the Romans so admire, VVho for the loue of Brutus swallowed fire. Not Romes great'st honor, and Collatiums pride For chastity, that by her owne hand dy'd Can equall this Alcest: but must giue place, In all perfection, beauty, fame, and face, Appeare in those faire colours without stame, As when Vlysses did the chaste loue gaine Of his Penelope, who twice ten yeares Expects the absence of her Lord in teares; Wh? neither threats, intreats, nor crowns can moue To attend the motiues to vntemperate loue. In him all vertues so vnited are, Neither loues blandishments, nor stormes of warre, No Circe, Syrtes, or Charibdis deepe, Can from the bosome of his chaste wife keepe. Oh decke thee in thy best and hollowedst robe That ere was seene vpon this earthly globe! More proudly dight, then when the Gods did striue To grace thy pompe, when Ioue did Iuno wiue, Wh? the great thunderer gaue thee a bright crowne And Pallas with her needle wrought thy gowne: When Neptune through his billowy concaue sought And for thee a rich Smarag'd found and bought, VVhen Phœbus on thy fore-head fixt his rayes, And taught thee fr? his harpe, sweet Nuptiall layes. VVhen Venus to their bounties added pleasure, And Pluto from God Mammon, gaue thee treasure. VVhen Mercury gaue fluence to thy tongue, To haue th' Epithilamion sweetly sung: VVhen Iuno to thy presence added state, And Cinthia, though that night she sate vp late, To watch Endimion, by her beams so bright, In th' Oceans bottome spide a stone giue light, A glorious shining Carbuncle, and that She gaue thee, and thou pindst it in thy hat: VVhen the God Mars gaue thee, not least of all, The richest armour in his Arcenall: VVhen Hebe fild thee Nectar for thy tast, VVhich from the Christal Conduits run so fast. Nor did lame Vulcan come behinde in cost, An anticke robe with gold richly imbost VVith Gold-smiths worke, and hammer'd from the wedge; VVith curious art, deep fring'd about the edge He did present thee, (pompous to behold) Berontes and Pyragmon wrought in gold, And left their plates of steele, to shew no dearth Of loue to thee: thou from our mother earth Hadst a gift too, of all the fruits that grow She fild her Cornucopia, and did bestow By fertill Ceres hand, to please thy taste A plenteous largesse; as in heauen thou wast At those great bridals, with like pompe and state, The Rites of these high Nuptials consecrate. Whom all our populous vnited Nation Attended long, with ioyfull expectation, Whom th' empire of great Brittaine wisht to see, And th' Emperour to receiue with Maiesty. Whom the Peeres ardently craue to behold, And the glad Nobles in their armes t'infold, Whom all the Nations in his way admir'd, Whose presence the rich Court so long desir'd, Whom London with applause wisht to embrace, (The Chamber of the King, and best lou'd place) Whom at his landing from the troublous maine, The people stand on shore to entertaine, And with glad shouts, and lowd applauses bring, Euen to the presence of the potent King. Behold that Prince, the Empires prime Elector, Of the religious Protestants protector, The high and mighty Palsgraue of the Rhyne, Duke of Bauaria, and Count Palatyne, VVith Titles equall, laterally ally'd To Mars his brood, the Soldiers chiefest pride, That from the triple-headed Gerion haue Kept from a timelesse and abortiue graue Faire Belgia, and her seuenteene daughters, all, Doom'd to a sad and mournfull funerall; Yet each of these in former times haue beene A beauteous Lady, and a flourishing Queene. Now when their widowed eies are drownd in teares, And by th' Hesperian Gyant fraught with feares, They are freed from slaughter, and restor'd againe To their first height by his triumphant straine, A youth so louely, that euen beasts of Chace, Staid by the way, to gaze him in the face. The wildest birds, his beauty to espye Sit round about him, and before him flye, And with their chirping tunes beare him along, As if to greet him with a Nuptiall song. But when they saw he was imbark't, returne As loth to leaue him, and together mourne. Chanting vnto themselues vnpleasant notes, And full of discords from their pretty throtes. Now lancht into the deepe, see by the way, About his ship th' vnweldy Porpoise play: The Dolphin hath quite left the Southerne Seas, And with a thousand colours seekes to please The Princes eye, changing as oft his hue, As he doth wish him ioyes; Behold in view, Where shoots the little Enuious Remora, Thinking his swift ship vnder saile to stay. O stop her prosperous course. But when she saw A face so full of beautie, mixt with awe, Vpon the hatches, sham'd what she had done, Her head shee doth below the Channels runne, No boysterous Whale aboue the waues appeares The Seas to trouble whilest the Pilot steeres, The huge Leuiathan dwels in the deepes, And wrapt in waters, with his femall sleepes, As loath to moue a tempest: Thus at last He in a prosperous calme the Seas hath past; Neptune meane time, in Amphitrites bowre, Inuited to a banquet, for her dowre By churlish old Octavius denide That paid her not, since she was first his bride: Shee knowing Neptune powerfull, as he's wise, Intreats him this olde Iarre to compromise, This difference held so long the God of Seas, Who being made Vmpire, sought both parts to please, That whilest he in faire Thetis Pallace staid, The Prince was past, without his marine aid, This when he know, that one so yong, so faire, Of whom the other Gods had tooke such care In his safe wastage, and that he alone Of all his choice gems, had afforded none, Of which his wealthie channels as full stor'd, Grieuing so puissant and so great a Lord Should passe his waterie Kingdomes, and not tast Part of his bountie, vp he starts in hast, Mounts on his Sea-horse, and his Trydent takes, Which all enrag'd, about his Crest he shakes. And calling Triton from his concaue shell Bids him through all the deeps his furie tell; That since no Marchant to the Indies traded Whose wealthie ships, with drugs and spices laded, Had made the verie Oceans backe to bend; Since he had suffered them from end to end To voyage his large Empire, as secure As in the safest ouze, where they assure Themselues at rest; since they for all the gold Pangeans fraughts them: with great summes vntold, Pearles, Stones, Silks, Sweet-perfumes &amp; Amber-greece, With profits richer farre then Iasons fleece; Since neither Marchant, nor yet Man of warre, Poore Fisherman, or such as reckoned are Sonnes of the Sea, or Bastards, Pyrats fell, For all the wealth in which the Seas excell, And they haue thriued so richly, would make knowne This newes to him, they now shall tast his frowne. Streight the foure brothers from their brazen caues Æolus vnlocks, who shake aboue the waues Their flaggie plumes, and as they rise or fall They hatch huge tempests: still doeth Neptune call To make a turbulent Sea. Triton shrils lowd T'Inuoke the helpe of euery stormie clowd They all conspire in horrour, at new warre; Meane time the foure seditious brothers jarre. The South wind brings with him his spightful showers, And gainst the cold and stormie Boreas powers His spitting waters, in whose foule disgrace His gusts returne them backe in Austers face, Bleake Aquilo still with the West-wind crosse, Mountaines of waues against his foe doth tosse; And he as much at him: in this fierce brall Poore ships are shaken, some are forc't to fall So low, that they blacke Orcus may espie, And suddenly are bandied vp so high, As if the Barke with tackles, masts, and shrouds, Ioue would like th' Argoe, snatch aboue the clouds. No maruell, we so many wracks to heare, Since Neptune hath of late beene so austeare; So many ships being foundred, split and lost, So many wrackt-men, cast on euery Coast; So many, that my passionate teares inforces, Since all the Seas seem'd to be shor'd with coarses. Long Neptunes furie lasted, made great spoile, And wrackes at Sea, for still the billowes boile With wrath and vengeance, till the Queene of loue Borne of the frothie waues, this suit gan moue, That since the high solemnitie drew neere Of this faire Couple, to the Gods so deere, As Heauen and Earth did in their ioyes agree, So at the last would his calm'd waues and he. These words of hers great Neptune did appease; So with his Trident straight he calm'd the Seas. Now's the glad day, how can it other be But a presage of all prosperitie! The early howres that from her Rose at bed Aurora call, the night haue banished: And enuying shee so long hath soiournd here, They chase the Hag from off this Hemisphere. Who when she but espies the peepe of day; Wrapt in her mistie darknesse, speeds away To the Cymerians, were she meanes to dwell And hide her horrid darksome front in Hell: But ere her blacke and cloudie face she steeps, The starres from off Heauens azured floare she sweeps, And will not let them see the glorious Bride, Whose presence was her hated lookes denide. This day, Apollo in his orbe of fire Ryseth before his hower, her face t'admire; And in meere joy that he may gaze his fill, He capers as he mounts th' Olympique hill: The morning blusheth guiltie of the wrong That she hath kept his steedes vntrac't so long, And such deepe sorrowes in her eyes appeares That all the World she waters with her teares. But when this vniuersall joy she cals To her remembrance, teares no more she fals, But for the glistering Rayes of Phœbus seekes With whose bright beames shee dries her blubbred cheekes, The monstrous Signes by which the Sunne must passe Guild with his glittering streakes their scalles of brasse. Phœbus as oft, as he hath past the line Hath neuer seene them in such glory shine: And all to grace these Nuptials. Ioues high Court Is 'gainst this day new starr'd (as some report) With stones and gems, and all the Gods attired In there best pompe to make this day admired. The Seasons haue prefer'd the youthfull Spring To be at this high states solemnizing: Who lest he should be wanting at that day Brings Februarie in, attyred like May, And hath for hast to shew his glorious prime Stept or'e two moneths, and come before his time: And that's the cause, no strange preposterous thing, That we this yeare haue such a forward Spring. The Summer now is busied with her seed Which quickning in the Earth begins to breed; And being sickish cannot well be spar'd. Autumne in beggers rags attired, not dar'd Intrude into so braue a pompous traine. Old Winter clad in high furres, showers of raine Appearing in his eyes, who still doth goe In a rug gowne ashied with flakes of snow, Shiuering with cold, at whose long dangling beard Hangs Isickles, with hoarie frosts made hard, Dares not approach, nor in that Center moue, Where liues so sweet a Summer of warme loue. Therefore by Ianus double face he's past Retyring by December, speeding fast Backward, with more then common aged speed, Most willing that the fresh Spring should succeed With chearefull lookes, and his greene dangling haire, Winters most wastefull Ruines to repaire. But oh leane Lent, why should thy pale lancke cheekes Threaten a suddaine dearth for seuen spare weekes After this surplusage; but that the God, That swayes the Ocean with his three-tin'd rod, Would feast these Nuptials with his various cheere, And nothing thinke, that the Sea holds, too deere? Because that as the Heauens gaue free assent, With th' Earth to fill these Bridals with content, Euen so the Seas their bounties would afford With seasonable Cates to Crowne their bord. Bacchus hath cut his most delicious Vine, And sent it through his swiftest Riuer Rhine, Least to these Bridals it might come too late, Which Brittaine with such joy doth celebrate. What Plannet, Starre, Fate, Influence, or Spheere, But in their operatiue powers hold deere These faire Espousals? Is there vertue, grace, Or any goodnesse, but doth claime chiefe place In these great triumphs? Can the Heauens afford Blessings that doe not Crowne this bridall bord? Can man deuise, or of the Gods importune A choice selected good, or speciall fortune, Which heer's not frequent? 'mongst the Saints diuine, Be euer henceforth crown'd Saint Valentine. Of all thy hallowings, let not this be least, That thy Saints day is honour'd with this feast. Thou hast the fauour to lead in the Spring, And to thy feastiue Eue, the birds first sing, With joy that Winter doth the Earth forsake: Vpon this day, they each one chuse his make. Couple in paires, and first begin t'inquire Where they may pearch, to quench the raging fire Of their hot loues, where they may safely build And from the bitter stormes their yong ones shield, Vntill there naked bodies be ful plum'd, And that with their fledgd wings they haue assumed Courage and strength, that when the season's faire They with their careful Dams may proue the Ayre. Learne euerie of you a new Nuptiall Lay To Solemnize the triumphs of this day: Your mourneful straines to sadder fates assigne. Now with glad notes salute Saint Valentine. For in this sacred, and melodious quire, The Angels will beare part, tis their desire To haue this combination shrild so hie That Heauen may Eccho with the melodie. And now me thinks, I from a Cherubs tongue Heare this applausiue Hymne most sweetly sung. A Nuptiall Hymne. Now's the glad and cheerefull day, Phœbus doth his beames display, And the faire Bride forth to lead Makes his torch their Nuptial Tead, O thou Apollo bright Lend vs thy cherefull light, That thy glorious Orb of fire We more freely may admire. But when seated in thy pride Thou behold'st the louely Bride, Enuie not when thou dost find Thy one eye by her two stroke blind: Thou art eclipst this day By a new Cynthia. Who though on earth shee keepe her Sphere Yet shines as faire, as bright, as cleere. If in clouds thou maske thy face Blushing at thy owne disgrace: Or cast aside thy glistering Rayes When she once her eyes displayes; We shall neglect thee quite, Thy powre, thy heat, thy light. Nor shall we misse thee being gone Hauing two Sunnes for thy one. T'seemes when I this couple see, Thy Sister I behold and thee, When you both were nurst long while By Luton' in Delos' Isle. But the faire Sunne and Moone Were there deliuered soone, Iust as I see these two grac't On Earth: So you in Heauen were plac't. Equally shine in the Spheares In like beautie, and like yeares: No sinister fate betide The faire Bridgroome, and the Bride O, neuer may blacke cloud Two such bright lusters shroud From the Worlds Eye, but still shine Till fate make you both diuine. He a Prince is, grauely yong, Catoes head, and Tullies tongue, Nereus shape, Vlisses braine; Had he with these Nestors raine. Inioying all the rest Of heauen (that we request) That they likewise would afford, To manage these a Hectors sword. Had great Ioue beheld this Queene, When Europa first was seene, O're the Seas he had not brought her, Nor Ægenor left his daughter. Europe that spatious ground Through the World so renown'd Had lost her stile, and ere her death It had beene cal'd Elizabeth. Had she then liu'd, Danae should Haue di'd an Ancresse; showers of gold Had not rain'd downe her to Intrap, All had beene powred in your lap. Io had neuer beene The great Ægyptian Queene, But for a Godesse after death They had ador'd Elizabeth. Could a fairer Saint be shrin'd Worthier to bee deuin'd? You equall her, in vertues fame, From whom you receiu'd your name: Englands once shining star Whose bright beames spread so far, Who but did lament the death Of that good Queene Elizabeth? To none I better may compare Your sweet selfe then one so rare: Like grac't you are from aboue, You succeed her in her loue. As you enjoy her name: Likewise possesse her fame. For that alone liues after death; So shall the name Elizabeth. Whil'st the Flower de Luyce we see With our Lions quartered be, The white Lion keepe his place. Dauids Harpe retaine his grace; Whil'st these vnited are, Despight all forraine warre, Foure great Kingdomes after death Shall memorise Elizabeth. May that name be raised hie, Nor in the femall issue die: A joyfull and glad mother proue, Protected by the Powers aboue, That from the Royall line Which this day doth combine With a braue Prince; no fate, no death, Extinguish may Elizabeth. May the Branches spread so far, Famous both in peace and war, That the Roman Eagle may Be Instated some blest day, Despight of Romes proud brags, Within our English flags, To reuiue you after death, That we may praise Elizabeth. That when your hie Crest is borne By the faire white Vnicorne, The Wild-man, the Greyhound, and Fierce Dragon, that supporters stand, With Lions red and white, Which with the Harpe vnite: Then the Faulcon joyn'd with these May the Roman Eagle seize. All the Nymphs straw sundry poses Made of Red, and of white Roses: On her Bed wait all the Graces: Maides to them resigne yourselues Oh may their Nuptiall loue In time a blest heire proue To make famous after death Frederick and Elizabeth. Oreyares, auo similes, gensmollis amoram. FINIS.</field>
