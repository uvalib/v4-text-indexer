THE INVOCATION. FAIR HEAVENLIE MVSES, Muife me now ane quhyle Vith Sacred furie, filling vp my vaine. Thow lustie lady, Queine of Cypris yle, Hich heyiss my saeils, And mak my passage plaine; Dycht and derect my dytment but disdaine, The quhilk Intends to steir ane staitlie stour. ?our Paladein Roland, beild to Charlemaine, I introduce, And all his dintis dour. Martche, Mychtie MARS, now from thy birnist bour Vith clincking sourd, cled in thyn armeur cleir; Present thy puissant person at this hour, That heauen, and erth, and hell, and all may heir This pert pelmell, quhilk present sall appeir. Thow fyrie vulcane, to my sute Inclyn, My sensis schairpe, And viwelie tham vpsteir, And all the roust Roub from my blont Ingyn. Stout Pucelle Pallas, pouss me to desyn His grawe attempts in monie dyuerss land for Angelique, Quhais personage deuyn Did Intertene him In King Cupids band: Bot nether force of his victorius hand, Nor firm effection, feruent and Inteir, Of hir againe ane spark of fauor fand; The Bird he bruiks not, thocht he beit the Breir. The histoir Is lamentabill to heir, Mad he becam for veirray teinfull noy, Thocht he surpast all vthers far but peir. Thus I begin the mateir to convoy. THE . 1 . CANT. Queins Venus Sone, The subtill smyling boy, (Quhois val?ant valor vincus may ilk vycht), Schot at this Roland ferslie vith esmoy Ane feddrit flan, Quhilk in his brest did lycht, And throch myd center of his hart did dycht, Ane proper part to place tuo heauenlie eis, Quhilks meid him thrall for all his mundan mycht And humylie sute for mercie on his kneis: No vonder vas, sen celest spreits aggreis, All to this God of deuetie Inclynd: Neptunus, dompter of the raging seis, And prudent Pluto, both he hes constrynd: Lord Ealus for all his haughty mind, And bludie Mars, be Cupid beine supprest: Grayt Iupiter he monie tyms hes pynd: So Roland, randert vincust vith the rest, Quho dyuers dochtie deids did manifest, for till obtein his peirles ladie fair, In Tartarie triumphantlie Increst His famus fame. As mychtie Monarck rair, Sum did him prayse, Sum thocht him but compair: Throch India, And all the Orient, Thay celebrat his acts heir and thair; He onlie hes the vog armipotent. To france Againe quhan he returning vent, Persauing Paris seidged, that staitlie toune, Be Numeds, Mors, and Espangols consent, Quhois nummers cled the feildis vp and doune, Conductit all be Agrammant thair boune, Quhair he In force of armie did confyd Of france to raif the Sceptor and the Croune, Quhill Roland stout abaittit all his pryd, Thair brasche of battell boldlie did he byd, And in the valor of his hardie hand Has hich Renoun Inritchit vonder vyd Abowe his prayse obteind In forran land: As lyon louse thair did his luik command, His strenth surmonts so furius and fell, That strengest steile mycht not his straik gainstand The loud alarum, quhan his dints did knell: As sillie Scheip dar not the volf Rebell, So fants his fois, And from his fechting fleis; At euerie Chok his courage dois excell: Quho byds the danger, suddan deth he dreis: His arms victorius hich auanst: Quho seis, Bids all beuar, the thudding cums so soir; And as thay speik, extinguist ar thair eis, Doune skelps the sourd, And dois thair lyf deuoir: As terrefeit haeir, that rins the honds befoir, So troups gois hence, Quhair he begins to fume; Quhair ans he hits, Remeid thair is no moir, Deid at ane dint thay gaet no vther dume: As lustie falcon litle larks dois plume, So harneis flew, Quhair DVRANDAL discends. Vas no defens, To flie thair vas no tume, Gif he approtchd, Bot lyfs constryndlie ends: The mortall cryis occurd quhair he Intends. Plaine vas that part; All past and gaif him place. Nocht suld ?e heir about him, quhair he bends, Bot hiddius schouts, cair, clamor, and alace, His armeur, hands, his vapnis, and his face, Bebathd in bluid of Campions about. He cleifs, he cuts, he peirsis, and dois chace. As Thunder throw the elements dois Rout, Or lyk bold bubs, quhilk Boreas breath blaws out, Or boustius Bombards, Quhan thay keinlie crak, So Roland Rangeit all the Chiftans stout Vith na les noyes; so staluartlie he strak, Sum left his scheild, And schortlie turnd his bak; Sum In Cauerne did creip to be assuird, At euerie motion feiring ay thair vrak, for dammest dreid thay thocht his dints Induird. This pithie Paladeine hes sic prayse procuird In schairpe persute of his disconfeit fais, Quhom val?antlie he in this sort InIuird, Tham chaceing thence In hirns, in hols, and brais; for suiftlie so amongs the prese he gais, As fyrflacht fell from firmament fast flew, Quhan mychtie Iowe his bittir blasts did rais, And all the proud contemmyng Gyans slew: The Bairdit horssis Mycht mak na Reskew Vnto thair Ryders, all In harneis drest, Bot both Renuerst, Quhan Dyrandal he drew; The one Lyis slaine, The vther plaine opprest. THE . 2 . CANT. NOW NYMPHS IMMORTALL, draw my dyt modest, And in my spreit sum pregnant propois spair, That I may sing with suggurit sang celest That heme of beutie brychtest but compair, The speciall perle surpassing maist preclair, The daintie dame, quham I dar not desyn, The tuynkling star so far Resplendant fair; I meine the peirles ANGELIQVE deuyn, Quha vincust all, And vill navayis Inclyn. The king, the knycht, the suldior, and the slawe, The auld, The ?oung, And all ar peirst vith pyn, Hir perfyt persone gif thay ons persawe; Thay birne, thay birst, thay duyn, Thay raidge, thay rawe, firm fettrit fast, And finds no force to flie; Contending all, be keine combat thay craw The douce Regard of hir celestiall ie. Comte Roland best and boldest first did drie Diseise, vith dolor dalie deip distrest, Quhill his maist martiall fortitude hir frie from Orient soile bereft from all the rest; His confort than And courage bothe Increst. Bot as the Clouds ar not ay constant cleir, So pane profound his plesour all supprest, And cair consumd his former Iocund cheir, At Mont Pyrens leissing this ladie deir, Be accident as ?e sall vnderstand. At tym quhan his mishap arryuit heir, Grayt Charlemaine haid thair conveind ane band Of hardie men, the best in onnie land, for to Reuenge the former Ancient feed, Quhilk Agramant did raschelie tak in hand, To vrak his Realme, And put his men to deed. Quhan Roland cam, grayt diligens vas meed To do him honor at his first reuoy; Him to resiwe the speciall prences geed Vith na les myrth alacretie and Ioy Than Hector entring vith triumphe in Troy, Or Mychtie Cesar vith his laurels greine; So Raeid the Comte, suspecting na annoy, Vith glorious face, And courtas aufull eine. Bot Rennault Raidged as tygar full of teine, Vith brows vpbend, At bargan vold he be; Of Angelique he vas so vincust cleine, That he haid rather in ane moment die Than this fair ladie vith Lord Roland sie; Quhilk bred betuix tham ane Immortall baill. And sen that nane this mateir mycht aggrie, King Charlemaine did circumspectlie daill: The battele being radie till assaill, Vith the aggrement baith of ?oung and auld, fair Angelique from Roland did he vaill, Quhill that his Armie haid gifn battell bauld, Concluding all Duke Bauiers suld hir hauld, In to his tent vith tender tretment drest, And Immolest according as scho vauld, Quhill of his Camp sum suir succes did rest: Syn of the knychts The victor and the best Be dochtines fell force of fois to dant He promesis thay suld be suir possest for Recompance vith this precelling sant. The Comte heirto At the kings vill did grant, Sen keine combat mycht so the mateir mak, Not being suir als quhair scho saif mycht hant Quhan both the armeis suld the gither shak. Helas, for than succedit all his vrak, for at deray Quhow soone the vangard gois, On horse scho lop, And did hir Iournay tak, And vald be thrall, scho thocht, to none of thois. This lustie dame obteine culd na repois for hote persute of euerie vordie knycht; Hir person peirles, And hir face formois, Oft hir constrains to tak the feirfull flycht. And now supposing till escaipe be slycht, At this hir voyage vtheruayis did chans, for In the vod befoir hir visage Rycht Ane knycht scho spyde on fute in armeur glans; Than dreid of dainger varps hir in ane trans, As tender faune vithin ane darnit den Quhan It persaifs the Leopard Auans, Or compast Close about be craft of men; for Rennault heir scho did perfytlie ken, Quha scherst his Bayard bendit from his hand, Bot to his feit his ?eill did suiftnes len fast for to rin fra he the fairrest fand; He plaints, he cryis, scho vill not stay nor stand, Bot fleis in feir as from ane Serpent fell, Scho gifs hir horse both brydle, chak, and vand, And muifs hir heils, his speid for to compell: It is vncertan to my toung to tell Quhilk of the tuo maist feruent ?elus beine, Scho for to flie, or he to Intermell, Thay both assay so schairplie to preueine: As Daintie Daphne, fleing Phebus scheine Vith lustie lyms so luiflie, squair, and quhyt, Quha vas transformit In the laurell greine, Quhan he approtchd hir persone maist perfyt, So Rennault, Raidgeing vith na les delyt, Sped vith sic speid, Quhill scho vas skairslie frie. Bot Strong ferragus, In the sammyng plyt, At Instant tyme Scho chancit for to sie, Quho In the battell haid sic drouth done drie, That to the Reuar thair to drink he past, Quhair scho cam suddan, schoutting for supplie Vith trembling hands And feirfull hart agast. The Sarrasin, vith bittir brag and blast, Hint out his sourd, for he perfytlie knew The maikles beutie, Quhilk Sic glem did cast And vith the rest haid done his hart subdew. He turnit stoutlie Rennault to persew, So tham betuix bauld bargan did begin; The plaits and mal?eis from thair harneis flew Be birnist brands in bristing to the skin, The fyre outbryms from steile all battrit In Vith stabill strenth of strong Redoubling dints, Quhilks far About tham meid ane hiddius din, As hamers beitting on the firmist flints. In this mydtyme fair Angelique not stints, Bot forduart ryds als suiftlie as scho may, Throch dens and dails maist priuelie scho mints And left all passage plaine for grayt effray; for gif ane bird from buse bend In hir vay, In veirray deid scho suirlie dois suppon That Rennault Ryns to gif hir ?it assay, Quhilks maks hir start at euerie stok and ston: Grayt dreddor dreing desolat alon, Scho vilsum vauers vandring vext vith vo, Hir mirthles mynd, molestit, making mon, Distrest vith storms, Is tossed to and fro. Ane day and nycht contineuall ryds scho so, Quhill scho persaived ane bocage growand greine, Decorit fair be lustie Reuers tuo, Quhair It vas priuie situat betueine, And circuat, so that It mycht skairs be seine, Be seimlie hils, And blomit brais about, Quhilks meid the vattir, cleir as christall cleine, Souche softlie sueit from euerie springing spout: The chirming birds againe did skirle and schout On tender tuists vith flurise freschlie spred. Heir Angelique, no dainger doing dout, from horse discends, And till Repois hir sped. Ane place scho spyis perfyt be Nature cled Vith Rosis reed, Meduart, And mergeleine, And couerit so vith leifs of branchis bred, That nane thairin Mycht be persawed or seine.

Sen tym that Roland vith hir haid past hence, Both day And nycht he diligent did Ryd In hir persute, puft vp vith proud pretence, As Duke Pirothous fumit At that tyd Quhan the Centaurs Perforce bereft his bryd. And quhair scho vent he so derectlie drest, That to the camp quhilk Charlemaine did gyd He first Arrywed, Quhair thay to him exprest Quhow all the battell vas be hir molest, And quhow The king Impeschit vas so long Be the contention creuall Quhilk Increst Betuix the tuo Redouttit Chiftans strong, And quhow scho haid eschewit tham among for feir to be the cheifest victors gaine.

And thus he thinks, “O happie tyme to me, That Roland slippit hes his tyme so vaine; Sic forton fair he sall not find againe.

Quho taks his tym, he may vith Reson ruse, Quhan tym occurs, Quhilk tymlie tym dois send.” Bould boudin so vith boult And bow bakbend Quhan till assault he lustelie began, All vas Impedit quhilk he did pretend; so lo, Ane Chiftan Quhyt as onnie Suan, Vith proud appirans of sum mychtie man, Cled all In armeur fete and ritchlie dycht, Cam ferslie ryding throch the forrest than Vith perlit helm, As siluer schyning brycht, And pannache quhyt hich set In sing of mycht. kyng Sacripant, Preparing to defend, Did leice his armet at this suddan sycht, And on his cursor hautelie did bend; Vith sum manass began he to contend, for creuall Raidge because his plesour stayt; The vther na les coueting commend To battell bould Rycht hardelie arrayt. The spurs And speirs no longer vas delayt, Vith horrabill hurle thay so conIoin perfors, As Ramping lyons miting haid assayt, Quhill bakuart foundert both thair hardie hors. Doune falls the king, And mycht not Rais his cors, Deed vas his steid, Quhilk on him lourdlie lay. The vther varior, haifing gifn the vors, Vith victorie dois spur And ryd auay. The Prence supprest haid not ane vord to say To his fair ladie, Quha befoir him stands, And so tormentit he behuift to stay Beneth his horss, Quhill that hir tender hands Supplid him vp, And lowsd the sadle bands. His grayt Regrait Prolixt var to defyn, Quhill scho sum confort him to tak commands, And vith hir speitche dois metigat his pyn. “?our horse it vas,” sayis scho, “quhilk did declyn; Repoise and fuid to him vas neidfull moir Than the combat; lat not ?our courage tyne, I knaw ?our valeur veill in tym befoir; All that is lost ?e schortlie may restoir; fume neuir so, Sir, for ane sempill fall, ?on lustie galland conquest hes na gloir: In my conceit, the mateir is so small, for sic ane chance Nane may ?ow vincust call, The honor rather vith ?ow dois appeir, Quho keips the camp, And as ane brasin vall Mycht byd him now Gif he var present heir.” As scho to confort dois hir man thus steir, Ane proper page cam galoppan vith speid, And tham Inquyrd, as he approtchit neir, Gif thay haid seine ane knycht all quhyt in veid. “?is, as ?e sie, he dung me doune in deid,” Sayis Sacripant, “I neuir thold sic schame, And be his strenth hes slaine my staluart steid; I ?ow Request to lat me knaw his name.” “The name,” sayis he, “appruifs the famus fame, Quhilk I vill schaw, And put ?ow out of dout: Ane virgin fair Immaculat but blame Hes Reft ?our vorschip vith hir courage stout; Quhair Scho Intends the hardiest may lout. This Is the puissant PRADAMENT but peir; Scherss heir and thair And all this vorld about, Nane sall ?e find may matche my ladie cleir. Sir, fair ?e veill.

The moir he thinks, The moir his care did cast Ane feruent furie from his glowing eis; for dolor deip Almaist he Raidgeing deis, Because ane maidin raueist hes his gloir At part Imprompt Quhair as his ladie seis, Quhilk maks his mone agment the larger moir. At last, persauing no Remeed thairfoir, Vpone the horse Quhilk Angelique possest He did ascend vith spreit perturbit soir, And hir in crouppe behind him hes he drest; And superceids to tym of better rest The sueit Iouissans of his appetyt. So Ryding thus vith vexit hart molest Againe Impeschit vas his douce delyt. Ane murmor raise: My author dois Indyt That be appirans all the forrest rang: Sum space heirefter thay persawed perfyt Ane cursor gross, And all his harneis hang In fynnest gould brycht garnist ritche and lang; Ouer dyks and dens, Ouer stanks, and reuers fair, He braying bends, And sturdelie doune dang Stoks, stons, and treis, And meed his passage bair. Sayis Angelique, “gif that my eis be clair, ?on is the strong redouttit dochtie steid, The bralling bustius BAYARD but compair. It Bayard Is, I knaw him veill In deid, My self sum tym In Albrack did him feid; Heir he repairs In proper tym And place As haifing sum cognossans of our neid. My Irkit horse he may Induir na space To beir vs baith, It var ane happie cace, Gif that ve mycht ?on cumlie cursor fang.” The king discends, And dois begine to chace, And syn approtching, softlie dois he gang To catche the brydle, Bot ane loftie bang The steide presents vith his tuo heils behind, for he vold turne moir ferdie quhan he flang Than flame of fyrflacht fleing vith the vind; At his Reuolts the rockis raird and dind, Ane mont of mettall mycht tham not Induir. O Sacripant, Thow happelie did find Thy fortoune now that from his stricking stuir So hes eschewit saif vntuitchit suir; for haid he hit the rycht, vas no Remeed Throch all the forgit harnes Quhilk thow buir; Bons flesche And bluid haid bruist beine to the deed: ?it Memor graitfull did not in him feed. for former fauor, Quhilk the Dame haid schawne, Vith humaine semblance vntill hir he geid As kyndlie hond, Quhilk haid his maister knawne; So In hir hand haifing the brydle drawne, He stabill stands, And dois no stirage mak; Scho vsis him at plesour as hir awne, for he sum certane Iudgement did contrak. Now Sacripant his tym did vyislie tak, for as the ladie Interteind the steid, He lychtlie lop abowe his puissant bak, And suirlie sat veill horsit now In deid. Syn singlie scho againe supplid hir neid, Vpon hir haiknay Ryding at deuyis, Quhill thay persawed ane armit man vith speid Auance behind tham vith dispytfull cryis; For yre and greif his flesche Inflamit fryis. At the first sycht fair Angelique him knew, Hir tender heart for feire began to ryis, And dreid did dim the glansing of hir hew: Duke Aymon sone It vas, Quho did persew To Schers his ladie, And his Bayard bald, Ewen he Quhom Scho did ofbefoir eschew, The hardie Rennawlt, as I partlie tald, To quhom hir hart as yce vas frosin cald, Thocht he hir luifit as his lyf and mair: To him In speciall vill scho navayis fald, Bot Rather die, hir haittrend is so sair. The cause heirof var langsum to declair, Quhilk did proceid of springing fontans tuo. Not syndrie far thay ar in Arden fair, Diwers effect thair liquor vorkis so, Ane feruent freind becums ane fremmit fo, To teist the one: The vther dois compell Ane hardnit hart all haittrend to forgo, And in the lusts of luiflie raidge to swell. Knycht Rennault heirof (as my text dois tell) Did deiplie drink, And Angelique againe Hir drouthe did quenche At the Inuyous vell. Befoir that tym, thay say scho suffert paine for Rennawlts luife, Quho than did hir disdaine, And now thay cheingeit var throche euerie poir. So, seing him, scho lyks no moir remaine, Behind thame rynning as ane brymmyng boir; Maist feruent dois scho Sacripant Imploir To flie vith hir, And him no langer byd. “Esteme ?e than I may ?ow not restoir, So sclenderlie do ?e in me confyd?” Sayis he againe, “I sall abaite his pryd. Is Albrack Battels passit from ?our thocht, Or quhow I was ?our onlie beild that tyd, Quhan Agrican vith Armie grayt ?ow socht? Incontrar him And all his camp I focht Vith nakit persone, gif ?e rycht recorde.” Ane vord till him againe scho ansuerd nocht, for Rennawlt now so nar approtching schorde That dout of dainger hes hir langage smorde. The superbe Persons both thay do prepair Vith martiall mycht contending to be glorde, As my nixt cant the maner sall declair. THE . 3 . CANT. O creuall luif, quho corresponds so rair To matche tuo mynds vith mutuall desyre, One thou ourcums, consumyng tham vith cair, The vther plaine permitting till Impyre. Thy fickill fancie, And thy feruent fyre, Dois fram be gaeise of thy tuo blindit eis. Paine as ve pleis, Repentance is the hyre, Thocht ve suld serwe the constant on our kneis. ?e sie quhat dolor dalie Rennawlt dreis for hir quha cuirs not of his cair ane myt; And monie mo disdanit duyning deis, Vith dew reward quho neuir ar requyt. The lairge prolixit histoir quhilk I dyt In this preambill lets me to remaine; I prosequit: Stout Rennawlt in dispyt To Sacripant thir vords exprimit plaine, “false commoune theif, Quhow dar thow in disdaine So for to steill my ladie, And my steid? Thow meschant mereits not sic nobill gaine; I sall beraiwe thame baith be dochtie deid. Defend the, trateur, And discend with speid.” The vthers courage hich exceld als far. “foule feibill beist,” sayis he, “thow dowbill leid, And is dissemblit as ane theif, And var. I the defy. Do quhat thow dow or dar, Betuix vs tuo now sall approuit be Quho bendid boldest Bragin may debar Vith burnist brands to bruike my ladie frie.” As byting barbats quhan thay disaggrie Vith ardent raidge, And furius fyrie eine; Or boustius buls ar terrabill to sie, Quhan thay to bargan boldlie baeittit beine; So to combat conIoins the knychtis keine. Bot the Circassian forcit vas to lycht, for Bayard haid so guid ane natrall meine, He vald not reullit be In ryding rycht, Bot beirs his heid vpon his counter tycht, And rauets bakuart quhan he suld persew. The spurs nor bit navayis him danton mycht for to molest his maister, Quhom he knew. The king, persauing that he so vithdrew, Maist firelie from him did doune discend. Ane martiall faet than mychtie did renew Conform to thair magnificent commend. Quhyls hiche, Quhyls low, The skelping sourds did bend, Quhyls thay rebat, And quhyls thay scharplie schair. As quhan Vulcanus dois his force extend Vith hammer flasting fyrflacht in the air, Vp hich to Iowe making the thunder rair, So stronglie strak the steitlie chiftans stout, Quhyls schort, Quhyls long, And quhyls thay seime to spair, Quhyls thay auance, And quhyls thay lychtlie lout, Quhyls couerit close, And quhyls thay stretche tham out, Quhyls heir, Quhyls thair, Thay skip from part to part, Quhyls stif thay stog, And quhyls thay bent about To schaw tham maisters of the fensing art. The knycht of clairmont vith couragius hart On Sacripant Ane ackwart dint did ding, Quhilk all astonist meed his arme to smart; As bruckill glass he did aschunder bring His targe of steil, Quhill all the rocks did ring, Quhilk quhan the craintiwe Pucelle haid espyit, Vith vo all vext hir hands began to vring, And doutfull dreid hir beutie brycht vpdryit; As the malfactor quhan the treuth is tryit, Quho seis his deth, And may find no remeed, So scho to Rennawlt feird to be applyit, Gif langer scho remanit in that steed; To Rennawlt quhom scho haits vnto the deed, Als far as he hir luifit in effect. Heirfoir besyd tham Scho no moir abeed, Bot turns hir horse And taks hir vay derect Throch thikkest vods And vildernes eiect from euerie passage maist frequentit plaine, Vith vofull visage spying ay suspect That Rennawlt rins In hir persute againe. Bot now approtchis hir profoundest paine, Quhilk till Indyt dois all my mynd molest, My reuthfull hart from sychs may not refrain for to record quhow duilfullie vas drest This lustie dame, bereft of quiet rest Now be ane hermet, cause of all hir cair; Quho meting hir vas vtterlie opprest Vith Cupids dart As I sall heir declair. The Subtill hermet mycht resist na mair, Bot deiplie did greine vound of luife Induir; Thocht feir did feed hir former fauor fair, Hir luiflie luiks did all his lusts alluir, And so constraind his aidgeit brest combuir In feruent force of furius fumyng fyre, That Bersabe in bathe I ?ow assuir Inflamd no moir king Dauid vith desyre: Bot he vas eildit, And his ase did tyre Till Imitat hir passing paise be speid, Vith nigromance heirfoir he did conspire To satisfie his vitius vilan deid. His conIurations, And his bakwart creid, Vith circumstans of monie circle round, In ceremonius maner did he reid, Quhill vickit spreits Infernall did abound from Plutos darckest dungeon maist profound; Of the quhilk sort one cheif he did elect, Quho brocht this dame in danger to be dround: Hir horse he reuld vith violent effect Throch Neptuns deips Till ane disert derect Be this decetfull hermets fraud and slycht; In the quhilk part he suirlie did expect for till obteine at vill hir beutie brycht. And so hir horse to dant Scho haid na mycht, Bot in the seis perforce he gois coak, And scho in vo bewrapt ane vereid vycht To saif hir self sat Suirlie on his bak, As Iupiter fair Europa did tak Throch bullering strems his strese for to restoir, Quhan as Mercurius priuelie did mak Hir velthie troups for till approtche the schoir Be the command of gentill Iowe befoir, Hir beutie so his godheed meed decay, That in ane bull he did transform his gloir, And throch the seis so suame vith hir away. Now Angelique Induring sic effray Be spreit Inspyrit in hir raidgeing horse, Hir haer disparplit, And hir ritche array Spred lyk ane quheile about hir cumlie corse, Vith pitie perst Protheus haid remorse To sie this ladie So Impeschd vith pyn; Both Egeon And Doris did thair forse, And all the rest of Marin Nymphs deuyn, To cause the Iaws thair tumbling cours Inclyn; Bold Boreas And Eurus did abstrak Thair bubbing blasts, And Tryton vith his tryn Supplide to hold hir on hir horsis bak. “I var to blame gif sic ane beutie vrak,” Sayis Mychtie Neptun, “Quhair I mak repair.” “And it to me var both grayt schame and lak for to torment hir vith Intemperat air;” Quod Eolus. “My pith now sall I Spair, Permitting pass this peirles perle of pryis.” At part apoynt So lands hir haiknay thair, Quhan Phebus cours till Occident applyis; All dririe droukit doutsum in deuyis Quhat for to do in that disert alon Scho stairing stands But motion, and espyis, As Image formit of the marbile ston, Quhair hiddius rocks obscuirlie did depon Thair feirfull fronts abowe that perrelus part. All kynd of confort being from hir gon, Vith stupifact distressit quaking hart Sich mycht scho not, so suffocat vith smart, Bot all besueld in sorrow dolor dreis; Quhill at the last trebusching out did start Ane fluid of teiris from hir reuthfull eis. Vith hands vpheld than falling on hir kneis, Hir trublit toung outbirsts vith grayt lament Agains the malheur of hir destineis, Beginning thus hir pitifull complent; “O mychtie Iowe, Quhy art thow crewall bent My martrit mynd for to molest so soir? I vofull vretche, quhois vorldlie veill is spent, May not resist thy malice ony moir. It not accords vith graytnes of thy gloir Contrare ane catiwe dourlie to contend; Thy gratius godheid humyllie I Imploir, Prolong not lyfe bot Suddan deth me send. I dalie dies ?it deth vill navayis end My lothsum lyfe Quhilk till agment my cair So situat is, And sorroufull suspend, As Phaeton vithin Apollos chair Throch feirfull monsters hurlling heir and thair, Quhill thow quho reuis abowe the heauenis hie Thy thudding thunder did vpon him spair. O Iupiter, extend the lyk to me. Gif thow hes saift me from the suelling sie, Vith sauuage beists heir to persawe me rent, Cause tham approtche vith speid and lat me die for to dissolwe my duill Incontinent. Quhat now awails the beutie excellent Quhilk thow O Nature did on me dispon? Of that grayt gift I lairgelie may repent. for It am I not raueist from my tron? My bruther Argail lykuayis lost and gon, To quhom Inchantit harneis not awaild, And als my father Mychtie Galafron, To battell kein be Agrican appaild, All for the beutie quhilk thow in me saild. Vold god I haid in Ethiopia thair Beine bred and borne, Quhair fairnes all is faild, And not in ynd ane maikles maede preclair. O Philida, thow happi vas and fair, Quha fed thy flock in pouertie and rest, Bot I vith Lucrece may lament in cair My onlie beutie dois my lyf molest. from part to part I pass persewd and drest In duyning dolor Quhilk I dalie drie. And ?it this thing deteins me maist supprest, I feir my honor quyt extinguist bie; for thocht I haif obseruit chastetie, ?it vandring as ane volsum vagabound, Report perhaps vill attribute to me That sum hes fauor in my fancie found; for meschant mouths of this malitius mound Of proper prettick vill vith pert pretens Prepair sum propos of ane sempill ground Quhair thay may purches place and audiens; Agains the quhilk auaillis no defens, Bot to gif liars liwe ane space to lie; And than vith tyme, As smell of sueit Incens, Treuth sall triumphe Immaculat and frie. Bot ?it fair ladeis circumspect suld bie for preseruation of thair vomanheed, That nane occasion sic vnseimlie sie, As ons may muife thair famus fame to feed. for as the recent rubie Rosis reed May not abyd all bitter blasts that blaws, So the renoune of beutie lyith deed Quhan vickit toungs be sum appirans schaws That vitius liwing honestie ourthraws, Quhilk causis beutie odius to bie, And our estait In dalie dainger draws To disposses vs of our vorschip hie; Quhairof gif men thair self ons victors sie, Thocht thay do flatter for ane space and feng?ie, Thay think ve ar als copius and frie To all the rest of that decetfull meng?ie; Thair teirs distels bot onlie to disteng?ie Our Chastetie Quhilk cheiflie suld precell. As to my self I sall vith reson reng?ie Thocht thay suld raidge lyk Cerberus in hell: And gif that fortoune creuallie compell My cairfull corps heir but delay to die, ?it sall my spreit vith daintie Diane duell, Quhilk is the onlie hoip reconforts me.” Lyk as the luiflie lustie Emelie Did celebrat ane sacrafice maist dew To this Chast goddes, sutting sum supplie The theban knychtis both for till eschew, So scho deuote vith palle And blanchit hew Hir gost commends in Dame Dianas hands, Attending tym quhan Deth suld hir persew. Vith trimbling hart And fixt regard scho stands, And syn, reteiring sumpart from the sands, Beneth ane rock abowe the sam scho spyis The foirsaid hermet bound in Cupids bands, To quhom vith speid for sum supplie scho cryis, And said, “O father venerabill vyis Lat pitie perce ?ow to Lament my paine; Sic teinfull terror on my bodie lyis, It Interrupts my toung for till explaine Quhow I in dreid and dolor dois remaine, As Daniell vith lyons meed repair. Bot thow Art send to help me vp againe, As Habacuc vas heysit be the hair; It me reiosis to persawe the thair. O holie man, I hartlie the exhort Of mercie cum and metigat my cair, for I sustenit hes na litle tort, Arrywing heir at this vnhappie port.” And so vith sychs and teirs scho schortlie schew The summe of thair hir sorroufull resort, Quhan touarts hir dissimulat he drew, Be apparance sembling deuotion trew, As Godlie Ierom, Paull, or Hilaire heir, And vith perfyt remonstrances anew He meed his subtill sanctitude appeir. “Delay ?our duill my tender dochter deir;” This hypocreit did rycht demurlie say, “I haife grayt pitie of ?our cairfull cheir, And to persawe ?our sorroufull array: Bot sen ve ar Incertane euerie day Of erdlie Ioy quhilk is so friuole vaine, Now lat ?our courage on sum confort stay, And tak in patience this ?our present paine; Quhan vo is past, veill vill returne againe. As plesis fortoune, so ve most Induir. My cumlie chyld, all plesour is prophaine Heir in this vorld, And no thing stabill suir.” As fraudfull fouller dois the foule alluir for to be catchit at his craftie call, So all this speitche peruert vas till procuir Place till obteine his plesour sensuall. for in effect the forme did eftir fall Quhan till Intretment doucelie he began, Oft clapping both hir cheikis quhyt and small, Syn kyndlie kyssit as ane amorus man, Quhill that his hand beneth hir vestment than He hamlie threw, And menit till Imbrace, As did the Iudgeis to the Chast Susan, Quhill Scho repulst him vith ane blusching face. So than persawing till obteine na place Be dailling douce at hir disdainfull pryd, In sort sinister ?it he suttit grace, Disclosing thair ane beuget at his syd, Out of the quhilk he did ane phiole slyd Vith liquor plinist till repress the eine, And vith ane sparking drop thairof did hyd The brychtest percing torches to be seine; The fairest lamps that luife possest, I meine, The heauenlie eis that chiftans did coak, Quhilks far preceld thois of the grecian queine, Quha brocht both Troy and Troians all to vrak. This foirsaid liquor sic effect did mak, That sueitlie syn in sleiping sound scho lyis, So that this vitius vieillard now mycht tak Of hir his plesour At his awne deuyis. He kist, he claps, he braist, he tuitchd, he spyis Hir glansing gorge, And curall lyps perfyt, Hir cristall paps, As proper perls of pryis, So dour, so douce, and so transparant quhyt, far fairer formyt Nor my Muse may dyt, Vith rubie heeds vpraeist as berreis round, And tham betuix ane distance of delyt, Quhair euerie vaine vith beutie did abound. Hir seimlie skin so sklender soft and sound, As collorit lileis fresche and flurist fair, In this disert Inhabitable ground But molestation he perusis thair. Bot feiblit corps mycht not vith vill repair; Do quhat he vold, his Standhard did declyn. He sayeit all meins, Quhill that he mycht na mair His dag misga, the snapvark vas not fyn, His Roncin sueire the first assault did tyn, Trebusching doune quhill nether spur nor vand Mycht onie farder pouse him fordwart; syn He lurks and lyis, And vill not ryd nor stand. The moir he spurd, The moir refuse he fand, He neuir start Nor onie stirage meed, Thocht oft he hyst him vith his harskie hand. He dammest drouppit doune againe as deid Vith panchie mouth als haw as onie leed, And all his hyd most lyk ane skrimplit ront; No chap nor chak mycht mak him lift his heed, His bruisit bit vas vorne so rustie blont; In vain he forst him to that flowing font, In vaine he schaiks the brydile to and fro, In vaine he vrocht for he vold neuir mont, And vainlie vaine he lang tormentit so, Quhill hir besyd at last he sleipit tho, Till now occurs ane new mishap againe Quhilk varps this ladie, all Inwolwed in vo, from deip distres to dowbill duill and paine. So is the cours of friuoll fortoune vaine, Quha seyndill schoirs vith single sorrow schort, Bot communlie quhan scho begins disdaine Cair till agment is all hir game and sport, As in this cace be pruife I sall report. And in effect the forme heirof to tell, Ane litle space from propos I resort for to dilat quhow that the sam befell. In hebude yle sum tym ane king did duell, Quho had ane dochter so surpassing fair, That be hir beutie brycht quhilk did precell In the sie landis, as scho meed repair, Cacht vas Protheus in the fettrit snair Of ardent luife Amyds the frostie strems; So that is vattrie brest Inflamit thair for fauor feruent all in fyrie glems, Quhill on ane day he so this ladie tems, Hir seing singlie valkand at the schoir, That of hir madinheed he hir frilie lems, And left hir so vith chyld but proces moir: Quhairvith hir father greuit vas so soir, He kild his dochter but paternall stay, Quhilk meed this pastor of Neptunus stoir Becum his mortall ennemie for ay. Strong ourks And Phoks And monsters euerie day from seis he send his peuple till annoy, Quhilks brocht his kingdom greatlie till decay. Thay did not onlie bestiall distroy, Bot men and vyfs mycht not thair lyfs InIoy, Brochs, touns, and citeis, var beseidged about, And euerie ane constraind to keip tham coy, for to preserwe tham from this maryn rout. Enarmed all thay dalie stuid in dout, Thair fertill feildis var dishantit lang, Quhill schersing help heirfro to be brocht out Vnto thair god thay did deuoilie gang. The reyttis done, The oracle than rang This subsequent respons apertlie plaine, That the remeed of this maist vofull vrang Vas till assuadge Protheus great disdaine In offring him ane virgin fair againe from ane till ane, Quhill that is raidge did stay, Na les of beutie than the former slaine; So ans contentit vold he be for ay. The fairest faces suffert first decay Be sentence said in this mischiwos sort, Ane beutie brycht present vas euerie day To this Protheus, till abstract his tort, Quhilks all susteind ane miserabill mort; Ane hiddius ourk tham duilfullie deuord. This law did lang thir landis lest athort. O lustie ladeis, heir ?our deth is schord, for gif ?our beuteis in thir bounds abord, This vickit monster most ?ow kill bot stay. No mercie may thir menis mynds remord; Vpon the riuage schers thay nycht and day Sum fremmit face the perrell till assay; Sum thay obteine be slycht, And sum be gaine, Sum thay alluir, And sum thay raife away, Vith this maist creuall coustume to be slaine; Thay bussie pass both hautie hill, and plaine, Sic neidfull prey for till prepair and find, Quhill quhair the beutie peirles did remaine, Ewen hir vith quhom the hermet vold haif sind, Thay cam at last, And did hir firmlie bind. O diwelische dome for sutche ane seimlie sant, O frowart fortoune fickle, false, and blind! Sall now ane monster hir devoir and dant Quha from the Caldest Caucasus caust hant Great Agrican to heittest part of ynd: Hir that the half of Scythia meed vant Thair lyfs for luife: And fers ferragus pynd: Hir that the puissant Sacripant constrynd To leife his velthie kingdome and renoune: And vordie Roland till rin by his mynd, And all the Orient turnit vpsyd doune? So singlie now sall scho in sorrow soune Bot one to giwe hir confort or relife. Thay led hir captiwe bound vnto thair toune, Quhill tym occurrit of this mad mischife; Than to the monster vas scho brocht in brife, Quhan thay of pitie haid sum space hir spaird, Quhair all the peuple, follouing hir in grife, Vith veping eis vpon hir beutie staird. Quho may exprime the pitifull regaird, The cair, the plaint, the clamor, and the mone, Quhilk to the hichest heauenis percing raird, Quhan scho vas cheing?eit to the stabill stone, Abyding deth bot help of onie one? for routh I meruell nor the riuage rawe. My pen heirof no farder may expone, for verray vo I most the mateir lawe. Quhat tygar veyld Or Serpent in the grawe May sie or think, but pitie and lament, fair Angelique all nakit as ane slawe Link till ane rock to be deuord and rent? O gif thy luifers knew, thay vold not stent To giwe the ayde, Thocht vith extremest deed Ten thousand tyms Thair bodie vold be bent Vith hardie hart to mak the now remeed. THE . 4 . CANT. My plume Imprompt Quho sall perfytlie leed Quhilk so converts from curssit cair to cair? Quho sall derect my dull forwayit heed Vith douce Indytment deulie to declair The grivous gronyngs And the sorrow sair Of Roland rycht, to quhom I turne againe, Quho dalie deis in dolor and dispair? No kynd of rest may in his brest remaine for egar grife quhilk grwsse in euerie vaine. O Melpomene, now ayde my da?ed dyt, And vith thy teirs fill vp my emptiwe braine, His percing passions till explaine perfyt, The scorching sychs, the sorrow, and the syt, Quhilk so vith suerfs oursets his hardie hart, All distitude of confort and delyt. Sen tym his ladie did from him depart, Nocht may remeed this deedlie dolorus dart, Except Inspection of hir fragrant face. for sorrow sad he seims to suelt and smart, That so hir lost, Saying full oft “alace”! In till his bed he turns from place to place, Quhyls vp, Quhyls doune, Quhyls hither thair and heir, Lyk as the schadow befoir Phebus face Of tuynkling vattir casting clairlie cleir, Or as the nocturne beams quhilk dois appeir But rest ay reilling throch the glansing sky. So Roland raidgeing for his ladie deir Mycht nother stabill stand, sit, gang, nor ly: Quhyls vold he birst out vith ane reuthfull cry, And quhyls vith sobs supprest vold hold his pace, Quhyls vold he fant, Quhyls vold he freise, and fry, And quhyls vith teirs bebathe he vold his face, Quhill pinching paine did pousse his speitche ane space Vith tein, vith terror, torment, and dispyt, Him self both cursing and his cairfull cace, To froune, and fume, And in this form to flyt: “O Thow my onlie darrest douce delyt, And chefe berawar of my captiwe braine, Vo vorth the tym that euir I did the quyt; Vold God that hour I rather haid beine slaine, for all the force of mychtie Charlemaine Vas not of strenth to tak the from my hand. Quhy vas I than so friuoll And so vaine To rander the althocht he did command? Quhy vold I not be battell first gainstand? Quhy vold I not all force for the defy? Quhy vold I not vith the haif left the land? Quho mycht or sould haif keipit the as I? No rycht excuse in to my part may ly. My onlie luife, My ladie, and my lust Gois single athort, quhilk maks my flesche to fry, In my defalt disturbit soir I trust. I viss my hart haid to the deth beine thrust Quhan I departit from thy persone puir. My lyfs releife, I haif occasion Iust To die for dolour quhilk thow dois Induir. As meikest lambe gois in the vods obscuir Bot keipar suir vith vickit volfis fell, So vanders thow, Quhois beutie vill alluir Sum vith the flour of thy first fruite to mell; Quhilk flour I sparit at thy chast repell, Quhilk flour beraifs me of all erdlie thocht, Quhilk onlie flour so maks my sorrow suell, flour dew to me for I it darrest bocht; O flour conding, that I continewall socht Hiche vith the Gods quhilk mycht haife giwene me blis, O famus flour vnto decay now brocht, Quhow sall I liwe for to remember this? This onlie flour was all that I did wis, And vissing it I fretit nycht and day, Now duilfull day to me that did it mis. Mishappie man am I for euir and ay, O vofull vycht, quhois veill is vent away. for gif this fair fresche flour so feidit bie, Doung doune in deipest doungeon of decay Than do I stand, And rather craifs to die. O god eterne, Convert this cair from me As plesis the in onie vther pyn, Sic deedlie dolor dow I navayis drie But disperation and my saule to tyn. Quhair art thow now, O lustie ladie myn, My onlie help, And confort from all cair, Moir dar to me than dytment may defyn? Quhair slyds thy self so seimlie sueit and fair But thy awne trusty Rolands pert repair Plaine to protect thy proper persone suir?” So said he, Syn in sorrow syching sair Inclusit held the duill he did Induir Vith cairfull corps consumd in canckerd cuir, Quhill Morpheus displayed his slummering scheild Abowe his brest, Quhilk partlie did alluir His hawie hart And veping eis to ?eild; ?it thocht he sleips, his sleiping is no beild from his consauit coustumabill cair. He dremd he vas in ane fair fertill feild At plesour sporting vith his luife preclair, Bot barran both this feild becam and bair Be bittir blast he thocht that boreas blew, And vith that storme he lost his ladie fair, And quhair scho gois no maner of vay he knew. Vith reuthfull cryis he socht and did persew Hir heiring sute secours to be defend, Bot ay from him he thocht scho did eschew, So that he cud hir navayis comprehend. Ane vther voce, as he did wauering vend, Pronuncit syn this sentence sad and Schort: “Thy veilfair, Roland, now is at ane end, Moir in this erth thow sall not Ioy nor sport.” Now vith this vord from sleip he did resort, His former vois beginning to renew: “Helas,” thinks he, “my ladie suffers tort, Quhill I hir sie no solace sall Insew; The reed, the quhyt, the purpur, greine, and blew, Heir I renounce, And euerie color fair, for vofull vychts vold veir no variant hew; Blak cleithe sould catifs cleine ourcum vith cair.” from bed he bends, for he mycht byd na mair; Blak vas his targe, blak vas his speir, and scheild, And all in blak he dois him self prepair, Vith truibill, teine, and trauell, tosd and teild. Throche fellect fois that fumit fast in feild Both grime and griwous but regard he gois for till obteine his brychtest blisfull beild, That sant celest supassing maist formois, Desyring all thair knawledge to disclois, Gif in thois bounds they haid hir beutie seine. Thrie nychts and dayis he neuir did repois, Bot tryis and spyis thair camp vith restless eine; The narrest touns that syn adiacent beine, The hils, the vails, the vods, and vildernes, He bussie socht as Tygar full of teine In dalie duyning dolor and distres. Throch all the parts of france he past expres, And throch Auuergne and Gasconie also, Throch Prouance als he did his Iournay dress, To Britannie and monie cuntreis mo, Returning syn to Pycardie; thairfro He scherst the borders round about of spaine. Quho may exprime the bussie sute and vo, The langsum labor, And the vrgent paine, Quhilk he susteind In stormie vind and raine, The cumber clamor, And contineuall cair, Vith tuynkling teirs from his tormentit braine, All for the absence of his ladie fair? It tedius var derectlie to declair His vilsum vayis vent be sie and land, Vith exploitis precelling but compair Vrocht vith his vordie val?ant valurus hand. Go, reid the histoir, ?e sall vnderstand Quhow from distres Olimpe he did restoir first to hir Croune, And nixt quhan he hir fand Round quhair ane monster cam hir to devoir, Than hich abowe thois peuple grew his gloir, Quhan thay beset him furius round about. for as the Ours, The Sangleir, or the Boir, Bald at the bay He stuid amyds the rout; Nane durst assaill except vith skirll and schout, Or stand adrich And at him dartis suak, lyk hunters quhan the lyon Ischis out for dreid of dainger fleing fast abak. His sourd so snell Als thick did clinck and clak, Quhair euir he verts his force And awfull face, As Schour of hailstains rappan on the thak, Or drums redoubling battell in that place. Than no defens auaillit all the space, His stalwart strenth so stoutlie did surmont, Quhill euerie Chiftan tuik the feirfull chace. Be onlie thraw of his victorius front Both heir and thair At vill he dois tham hont, And quhair he cums thair keinlie did he kill. Nane docht Induir quhair Durandall did dont, Not thow O Hector, Nor the fers Achill. THE . 5 . CANT. As painfull Pilgrim Pressing to fulfill His Irksum Iournay passing to and fro In dririe nycht, So I agains my vill Dois stot and stummer in my mateir low: I haif no vay quhairbe derect to go, Bot as the vycht quho vanders vilsum blind This vork of myn behuifs me schers it so; Quhyls heir, Quhyls thair, Quhyls fordwart and behind, The historie all Interlest I find Vith syndrie sayings of so great delyt, That singlie most I from the rest out spind, As the vnskilfull prentes Imperfyt Quho fyns the gould frie from the laton quyt. No vonder thocht my vittis vaueruill; In flowing feild of sic profound Indyt My minschit meitir may bot mank and spill. ?it as the painter stairing stedfast still Vith trimbling hand his dracht perfyt to draw, So Indevoir I vith my sklender skill for to do better than my breath may blaw. Accept guiduill, for I guidwill sall schaw To fram so furth as I haif done Intend. fair Angelique vas linckit as ?e knaw Close till ane rock hir vofull lyf to end, As alabast statue Solitar suspend Vith stabill eis Attending onlie deed. The Ourk approtching be Protheus send Hir to devoir ane hiddius rumor meed, Quhan ewen abow hir at that Instand steed knycht Rodger keine, on Hypogriphe quho flew, Cam pricking doune but feir of onie feed And did this dam vith diligence reskew. Thocht palle perturbit vas hir heauenlie hew, Hir glistring eis the dochtiest so dants, That vith ane blink scho Rodger did subdew, Sic seid of luife hir persone seine Implants, Quhilk nakit vas, And no perfectione vants, Resparsit vith hir gouldin hairs perfyt, As Phebus beams in guidlie garding hants On recent rosis And fresche lileis quhyt. “Quhat crewall hart Inuenemit vith dispyt,” Sayis he, “hes bound the to this frostie stone? O doucest dame, thy body of delyt Vith luiflie leessis sould be link alone.” Hir cumlie corps, as he did thus propone, for seimlie schame reed sprinklit mycht be seine, lyk vermell paintit on the Iwore bone, Or cramsie silk in satine quhyt and cleine. His royall ring giwen be his ladie scheine The sam he placit on hir fingar fair; Quho It possest Inwisebill thay beine, Quhan in thair mouth thay buir this ring preclair; It haid also ane vther virtew rair, All sorcerie It did extinguise plaine, So that be It one harmles mycht repair Of varlow vitche or vickit visione vaine. The peruers brunnell be his subtill braine This Ring befoir from Angelique did steile, And the magnifique Bradamant againe Reft it from him, Auld Atlant till asseile, Quhan he Inchantit held hir luifer leile This foirsaid Rodger captiwe In ane tour. Syn, quhan his former fortitude did feile Be byding lang in vickit Alcins bour, Scho send it him in sing of paramour Be prudent Melisse, Quha from thence him brocht; And he preserwed it ay vnto this hour, Quhill torche of luif now in his hart so vrocht, That fyre heirof throch all his bodie socht, And him vpkendlit in ane glowing gleid; This nakit figure so bereft his thocht, Quhair ewerie beutie did his fancie feid. So Rodger raeid, Reiosing as I reid, Vith this Diana dressit him behind On Hypogriphe, auancing hich vith speid, As falcon fair suift fleing in the vind, Espying quhair sum proper part to find To raipe the fruite of this his conquest gaine. Sic birnand brands his bowdin brest did bind, The moir delay, The moir Agments his paine; Vith luiflie luiks quhilk he culd not refraine Oft blinks he bak, And softlie did hir kis; And seing syn ane situat plesand plaine, Vith Iofull hart doune he discends in this, Quhilk montans circuat round as he culd wis And flurist treis quhairon the birds did sing, Resembling rycht ane Paradice of blis, And in the myds ane fontan fair did spring. from Hypogriphe that did tham hither bring Thay lycht, And left him linkit at ane staik. Now Rodger heir single vith this ladie ?ing, Vncled befoir him quhytter than the laik, No vonder thocht fair Bradamant his maik pass from his mynd be sutche ane seimlie sycht. Quho mycht refraine now for this ladie saik To mont aloft vith all his members tycht? Not thow ?enocret froisin sillie vycht, This traine of luif thy continence vold rawe. Than Rodger birning for hir beutie brycht So bendit beine, he mycht not byd to crawe In Cupids luiflie ludge Ingress till hawe, Bot be bald battrie vold the blockhouse tak. The percebill primp port he did persawe, Quhairof preparing till vpclose the chak, Both scheild and corslat from him did he suak, His haber?sone and harneis all vith speid, Quhilk as ane barrier held his ba?on bak; No meruell thocht the fortres schouk for dreid. Now Angelique eschaming at this neid Vith eis derectit on hir bodie quhyt The ring quhilk vrocht so monie vondrus deid Scho did persawe; And raueist with delyt Scho knew it veill: And als it vas not quyt Of vertew great quhilk in it did consist; from hand till hand scho subtelie perfyt In till hir mouth it catchit or he vist. As fyrie glem extinguist at ane flist, Or glance of Phebus glorius gouldin face Maist suddan schaddowit vith ane cloud of mist, So scho evanist from him in that place. He sychit soir full oft And said “alace,” far circumvenit quhair he did confid.

Thair ardent yre did moir and moir renew, And thay haif no thing bot thair hardie hands To end combat: So vechtie newels threw Brawe birnist plaits breaking thair boucklit bands: Lang battrit both thir knychtis bold but brands, Quhill Interlest thay strictlie strawe at last, And ether vther stiff as steile gainstands; Thay suak and poulsis to and fro full fast.

FAIR ANGELIQVE No longer may defy The schot seueir quhilk thrals hir hautie hart; The lord of luife victoriuslie dois cry On all the gods to sie this ladie smart, Quha pullith holsum herbs in euerie part To stem the bleiding of hir luifer new, Imploying all hir diligence and art At vtter mycht his lyf for to reskew, Reiosing so in his sanguinian hew As Philles of Demophoon haid delyt, Or Ariadne quhan Scho pitie schew On Theseus from deth his lyf to quyt. Quhat sall I say? Quhat sall I do Indyt? Moir amorus vas not Medea seine Of gentill Iasons luiflie vult perfyt, Quhan Scho beheld the beutie of his eine, Nor vas this ladie, deiplie vondit greine Of this diseissit deedlie manglit man, All brint in baile. As Dido duilfull queine, Quhan scho socht counsele at hir sister An Concerning both the cumlines and clan Of hir Ene, Quhomvith scho thocht to mell, So Angelique Is vext as scho vas than Vith restles thochts And may thame not expell.

Moir pain for him than for hir propir part Vith dowbill pains Scho painfull dois posses, And moir and moir Ingrawed the fyrie dart As he in bewtie moir did conueles; The lyf maist chast, the quhilk scho did profes, Hir faithfull freinds, hir fredome, and hir fame Scho lossis quyt for luife of him expres, This Ganymede that Medor hecht to name.

O val?ant king of circassie this nycht Thow art depryuit of all erdlie rest; Thy vasall lyf It may no longer lest, Thow art bot deed for veirray amorus yre. Renounit Rennawlt, vith great paine opprest, lost is the sueit sould slaik thy deip desyre. ferragus, flammyng all in luifis fyre, Quenchd is the spring that may thy murning meise. Sic pitifull spreit thy ladie dois Inspyre, That Medor to hir fragrant garding geise And dois hir prime Rose be the ruit vpreise; At plesour planting in hir fertill feild He saws his seid, And eits the fruite at eise, Quhilk neuir man befoir him self haid teild. Quhyls in his armes Scho dois hir bodie ?eild Vith rosie reed gilting hir visage quhyt, And quhyls hir mouthe abyds bebathd and beild On his tuo lips preportionat perfyt. Quhyls scho resaifs, And quhyls scho dois requyt The luiflie sound assaultis soft and sueit; As tender delicat daseis of delyt Vith bodies Ionit plesandlie thay meit; Thir persone both vith proper sports repleit, Bair of all baile, Abounding into blis, In luiflie liquor lustelie did fleit And onlie raueist vith the Ioy of this. So Medor now possessith at his vis Bot onie merit or occasion Iust The Recompans Quhilk campions did mis, And beirs the badgie of thair hoip and trust.

He onlie reuls hir thochts but proces moir, Hir saull, hir lyfe, hir bodie, and hir hart. In tym Quhan Cupid thus delascht his dart, Sueit vas the sesone seimlie to be seine, The feilds annamelit vas in euerie part Vith dyuers hews be lustie flora queine, All bogs thay blumd, And vods vas growand greine, Quhairin thir luifers dalie meed repair; Quhyls vnder schaddow solitar thay beine, Quhair birds outbirstit doulcest verblis rair, Quhyls in the dails, the dens, And midows fair besyds the fontans, And the plesand parks. And as thay pass sum vacant tym thay spair To Interleice vith craftie curius varks Thair names in syphers in the tender barks, Vith sum deuysis formd in facund dyt; And Angelique vith hir awne hand thame marks In signe of stedfast ametie perfyt. And to decoir this dalie douce delyt The nuptiall band bound vp vas tham betueine, Vith na les plesour to thair appetyt, Althocht that thair na pompe Imperiall beine Than Mychtie Mars vith venus did conveine, Quhan Subtile vulcan did tham both arraist In craftie net, Syn throche the heawenis meed seine, Quhan Phebus cam, Quhow thay lay Interlaist.

And in the nycht thay so conIunctlie ly Bebathd in bliss, As luifers oft hes beine, Quhill Cleir Aurora darknit clouds schot by, Vpwarping vyd the firmament sereine Vith purpure sprayings from portis christalleine. Quhan pastors sped thair floks vnto the plaine, Vith monie sang And Interlude betueine, Thay glaidlie go to glansing feilds againe. Thair vas ane spelunc quhair thay did remaine, Quhan lampe of day maist vehement hote did scheine, Tham seruing so As it, quhilk in the raine Did eise The TroIane And The Cartage queine. The litile lambis bendit on the greine, As thay best mycht thir luifers to content, Pan And his troupe thair seimlie did conveine Vith plesand pyping And vith quhissils quent. Vith dulcorat voce celestiall and lent fair Philomela And dame Progne flew In suawe soft souching of the ?ephir vent, Quhilk fresche amongs the blomit brainchis blew. Both Driades, And Demigods anew, Vith Echo schill, And Nymphis monie one, All till agment this mirth sum solas schew. That day from seis outIscht the great Triton for to salute lord Phawnus In his tron, Magnific set in his Robbe royale doune. And flora franklie did fair gifts dispon, Expressing thair hir puissant ritche renoune, Quha buir parfumd ane odoriferus croune, Vith varient cumlie colors hich auanst, Sum Reed, And greine, Quhyt, Blew, And Purpour, Broune; As topas scheine Or diamonts thay glanst.

Not Tyterus did on his quhissill play Vith greatter mirth Than thay did all reiois, Nor Coridon sang not so sueit I say for till alluir Alexis luife formois. O Paladeins, As Tantalus ?e lois This recreation turning to ?our noy, And Medor lyk the knycht Clariadus gois, Quhan he did Meik Meliades conwoy from fontan quhair thay haid conweind vith Ioy. Not thow quho famus Helena possest Obteind sic plesour As this sempill boy In his Renounit Angelique modest. His fortoune so be accident Increst, That he surpast lord Amadis of france, In rewling thus ane beutie Immolest, Quhilk did abowe fair Oriane auance. for till depaint at lenth thair full plesance My langage laiks all Ciceronian dyt; I neuir smeld sic luiflie recompance. Heirfoir to vichts venerian I quyt To form in verse virgilian perfyt Thair facund fassons, And thair freindlie cheir, Thair kynd conceits, And dalie douce delyt, In firm effectione feruent and Inteir. Now quhan thay so haid left Ingrauit heir, As I haif said, dictums perfyt Indent, That in thois parts maist plainlie mycht appeir In thousand sorts thair amorus consent, Quhilk proper poyntit pensile haid done prent On fontans, Rocks, Cauerns, And plesand treis, To schaw thair stabill permanent Intent Maist patentlie to all beholders eis; The Curius knots so circuat quho seis In monie vayis about the letters plet, Thairbe the bands of Cupid notifeis, Quhilk haid thair amorus hartis Interknet: And heir abowe vas sum flour panseis set, Vith darts Ingrawe, Declaring be dewyis That in that proper place haid luifers met, And offrit Venus thankfull sacrafyis.

THE . 11 . CANT. Perplexit Pen againe to paine apply, Denunce the teirs that from thy dyt distels. Now for ?our ayde Ramnusia I cry To reule arycht the rancor Intermels. This trublous teine my tyrit toung compels To dry for drouth that I may not declair, Vithin this goulf, Quhair source of sorrow suels, My sensis so suffuscat ar vith cair. Vold god Bocace mycht in my place repair This tragedie perfytlie to compyle; Or Reuerent Ouid vold the sammyng spair In Metamorphois of his steitlie style. for lyk as myrth dois mak the visage smyle, Or plesand lycht reiosis moir the ie Than deip perbrouil?eit dungeons dark and vyle, So vanton verse moir aptlie dois aggrie To pouse the pithles spreit vith sum supplie, Quhilk I posses, laiking the curius vaine, Than mirthles mateirs that ama?is me, And doubill duls my dolorus dullit braine. ?it sen the burding dois on me remaine To sport My Prence, Quhois courtasie bening May mak me aide, As meed the gowldin graine, Quhilk did Eneas to his Iournay bring, I Indeuoir the remanent to sing Of Rolands fall in furie at the last. Help at this neid, O grei?lie ghests maling, Vith spedie pen to mak this propose past, Compact in breiff this bailfull bittir blast, Quhilk dois my style renwerse in disaray, And all my sensis na les maks agast Than Nabuchodonosors great decay. The Monarck Ninus that in preson lay, Of croune bereft, And captiwe to the deed, The puissant Cyrus, king of perse, I say, Quho vincust Cresus, Syn did lose his heed, Great Alexander poysand but remeed, Nor Mychtie Cesar, Quho vas schortlie slaine, Skairse represents so lairge of fortouns feed As Our Comte Roland quho did lose his braine. O friuole fortoune fikile false and vaine, Quhy dois thow vex this vorld vith sic annoy? Thow hich exalts law to deiect againe, Thy quheile ay tumbling vith decetfull toy. All that suppons maist suirlie till InIoy Thy hawtie vauering hairis vith the vind, Vith subtile smyle oft tyms thow dois distroy, And for reuard presents thy pow behind; No force auails thy fikilnes to bind. Dame Indiscreit, I sute of the no grace; Thow art my fo, for I culd neuir find No kynd of fauor in thy fen?eit face. His maiestie hes pouer in this cace Vith sueit regarde Thy sournes till assuadge, Quhois Royale feit Maist humylie I Imbrace To saif me from thy rancor and thy radge. Thy course Inconstant in till euerie adge Pruife dois recorde, Thocht I not specifie. Great Baiacet that turk thow did Incadge, Quhom Tamberlan maist duilfullie meed drie Ane extreme slawrie till that he did die; The one thow did from bass estait awance, And dang the vther doune from hich degrie, So is the coustume of thy fatall chance. for to record that potent king of france, Quho in the sporting of his manlie spreit Vnto the deed vas percit vith ane lance, Is pruife that thow in variance dois fleit. King Alexander is exemple meit, Quho reuld abowe the Antique Scottis keine; The hardie force quhairvith he vas repleit, Nor ?it the prudence quhilk did in him scheine, Could not eschew the rigor of thy teine, Bot creuallie be the he vas forlorn In picking of his horse as mycht be seine Abowe the rock thair situat at kingorn. for, as the rose annexit to the thorn, So is thy plesour vith sum paine prepaird: Or as the vyde Increscis vith the corn, So thow perturbs the cheifest but regaird: Quho valks at vill vithin thy vauering ?aird, And dois delyt to smell thy suggurit gall, Vith suddan storm his stait sall not be spaird; Bot as Pompey Or hardie Hanniball So sall occur In fin thair fatale fall. The strong redouttit dochtie Darius, Quho lang did dant his mychtie nychtbours all, Be venim of thy visage varius, Quhan force of fois he fand contrarius, New battell thryse he bauldlie did conveine, Bot ruittit out he vas as Arius; first did he lose his kingdome and his queine, His mother, guids, And childrine all vas seine In the possession of his enemie; Syn lost his lyf, And mycht na vayis obteine At his last breath so meikile laser frie As natiwe freind Or seruiteur to sie, Bot in his chariot vondit to the deed He thocht it did his painfull spreit supplie, Quhan till his fo his last regrait he meed. Queine Semerame Thow lang did velthie leed, Quha in hir courage disaguisde hir kynd, Bot all thy fauor turnit in to feed At hir last battell vith the king of ynd. Dame Panthasile, quhais hich magnanime mynd Dill thrall the boldnes of the grecians stout, Thocht for ane space thow prosperus Inclynd Vith blast of fame to sound hir praisis out, In tragedie aluayis thow brocht about Hir proud attempt And mychtie mundan gloir; Scho and hir ladies All that seimlie rout Did vincust die, Quhilk dewlie I deploir. ?enobia, Quham beuteis did decoir, Hir profund prudence Nor hir hardie hand Mycht not resist thy malice onie moir fra ans scho did Aurelius gainstand, Quho brocht hir captiw from hir natiwe land And till triwmphe abowe this cairfull queine Hir persone fixit at ane chariot band And drew hir so throch Rome apertlie seine; O crewall fortoune, noysum vas thy teine; Thocht scho presumd all Asia to gyd, Thy recompance maist freuch and friuole beine: So all are serwed that dois in the confyd. Thy slipprie solas dois als schortlie slyd As yse dissolues vith flam of feruent fyre: Thy douce delyt vith dolor is dewyd, Quhan we beliwe to find our harts desyre: Vith fikile fassone so thow dois Impyre Quhill euerie stait may sie the facill flot: Thow gifs no gaine to him quho merits hyre, Bot at thy lust dois attribute the lot: Thou maks the giltie sum tyme seime but spot, And guid desert in to the dust dings doune: Vit valkith oft in till ane raggit cot, And folie set vp in ane veluet goune: Ane laird be the becums ane meschant lowne, Ane lowne againe be the is meed ane laird: So In all things thow art ay blindlie bowne To rycht nor resone haifing no regaird. Thow rakles rins, As rasche and restles baird, Both vp, and doune, befoir, and now abak; I knaw no puissant erdlie pomp prepaird Thy friuole frailnes firmlie to coak. Gif ether visdome, force, or vordie fak, Mycht haif rebellit quhaire thy baile is boune, Than Roland haid be the susteind na lak, Bot euir hichlie borne the palmie croune; Quhom thy deceit degressis na les doune Nor Hector, traillit At Achylles steid, Vas changeit from that hector of renoune, Quho umquhyle reft Achylles of his veid. Impolist pen to Propose new proceid, Returne to text And dyt of Roland rycht. He most Induir, And I most schaw Indeid, This alteration quhilk did on him lycht. Now eftir that this Strong redouttit knycht Be ampill pruife all vthers did precell, Quhill all the vorld abaisit of his mycht, At last in schersing Mandricard so fell He seis ane christall reuere douce distell About the bordour of ane mydow fair, Quhair flouris fresche maist sauoruslie did smell, And monie seimlie frondise trie preclair, Obumbrat all this situation rair. Doune he descends amyds the blossoms greine for to refresche him in the temperat air; Sen dayis tuo he haid in trauell beine In sutting of the foirsaid Sarraseine. Bot heir depryuit vas he of repois, And all his confort turnit in to teine, Quhan that his vofull eine haid done disclois The viwe handwreting of his onlie chois, Ingrauit thair on monie growand graine; for this vas ewen the veirray place formois, Quhair scho and Medor vont vas to remaine. In thowsand wayis that part did all explaine Thair schyphert nams, As I haif schawne befoir, Bot euerie lettir bruist his bailfull braine, And percit throch his vondit hart als soir As duilfull deedlie dart him to deuoir. Vith monie vayis maist cairfullie he socht till schift the sorrow that so did him schoir, And not to credit sic ane noysum thocht, Efforcing him vith feirfull spreit afflocht for to beliwe that Scho, of hir guid grace, In his remembrance haid thois vordis vrocht, Him so surnaming Medor in this place; Or that sum vther Angelique percace So in this sort haid done thair luif furthschaw. Bot full assuirit vas he ?it alace, for the characters suirlie did he knaw, Quhilk his awne ladie vsit ay to draw, Bot could navayis him self beliwe at all. So vith opinions he the treuth did thraw, As doutfull trust did in his fancie fall Him self to suadge vith sum assurance small. Bot as hote collis vith sum vattir cold first seims to slaik, ?it eftiruart thay sall Vpblais in fyre moir feruentlie and bold, Ewen so the moir that he extinguise vold His glowing greif, the sam the moir did ryis. As feltert foule, quhilk glew Or girn dois hold, The moir scho flychters, Scho the faster lyis, The moir also that he did deip dewyis This mortall pansiwe terror till eschew, The moir profound his paine did him suppryis, Quhilk force nor visdom mycht navayis reskew. In this estate approtching neir he drew Till the cawerne, Abowe ane fontane cleir, Quhair vodbind and vyn brainchis linkit threw Ane plesand tortur at the entress heir, Decoring all this proper part so deir To both the foirsaid luifers euerie day; for quhan fair Phebus vith his heit seueir Did brymlie byrne, heirin Imbrast thay lay; Quhairfoir thair nams both in and out I say Heir drawne vas ofter than in onie place. Vith cake, vith coll, And pensile scharp alway, Both heir, and thair, vas schawne thair happie cace. The Cairfull Comte vith sad deiectit face full monie luiflie dictums heir did vew Be Medor vrocht, Quhilks at the sammyng space Als recent fair and viwelie formit schew As Instantlie thay haid beine forgit new. And for the feruent vonderfull delyt That heir did to this Adonis Insew, In verse he drew this subsequent Indyt, Quhilk vretin vas maist plainlie and perfyt In his awne langage, As I do suppois, Quhairof the sentence I sall heir recyt, Thocht I exactlie may it not disclois. O herbis greine, And prettie plants formois, O limpid vattir springing suawe and cleir, O cawe obscuir aggriabill to thois Quho vold tham cuile in thy fresche vmber deir, Quhair Angelique maist beutifull but peir, In vaine desyrd be vthers monie mo, Oft nakit lay betuix my armes heir, I medor puir, quhom ?e haif esit so, May not requyt ?ow moir, Bot quhair I go ?our praise sall euir stedfastlie Induir. Lords, ladies, knychts, And lustie luifers tho, And euerie gentle hart I will procuir To viss ?ow veill And frie of dainger suir. Both sone, and mone, and Nymphs ?ow saif from tort, And neuir Pastor vith his troup InIuir ?our verduir ritche, O seimlie fair resort. Bot ay about ?ow birdis blythlie sing, And vnmolestit be ?our siluer spring. In toung Arabic vretin vas this thing, Quhilk langage Roland rycht expertlie knew, And oft he red it contrarie to vring The veirray sentence from the mening trew. Bot ay the moir that he did so persew, Moir plaine and ampill did the text appeir, Quhilk to the death his thirlit hart neir threw. Assault of sorrow socht him so seueir, That staring still he stuid astonist heir, for vo almaist void of his vittis all, Vith hawie fixit eis And cairfull cheir, Vpon the stone As sensles stonie vall. His chin declyning on his brest did fall, And cloud of cair held doune his cumlie front, Quhair left vas no audacitie to brall, for boyling baile his boudin braine haid blont. Great egar greif so griwous did surmont, That he onnavayis mycht relasche his vo Vith vofull vords as vmquhyle he vas vont; Nor ?it no teiris from his eine could go, His liquid humor suffocat vas so, As quhan in veschell vyd vith narrow throt The vattir choks And may not flow thairfro for great aboundance that dois in it flot. No vonder now althocht his brest be blot Vith dainger deip of deedlie duill in deid, Bot ?it his hoip could not dissolue the knot Quhilk in his ladies loyaltie did breid. So vith sum trust betosd and meikill dreid He scherst his thochts to think this thocht vntrew, (Quhairon his fancie for ane space did feid And feruentlie dois viss it till Insew), That sum ewillviller all thois dictums drew for to diffame his constant ladie frie, And be sic bittir blame his baile to brew, That suddanlie quhan he the same suld sie for percing paine mycht at that Instant die. “O lord,” sayis he, “quhat vehement dispyt hes he declaird, Quhom euir so it be. Veill Imitat hes he hir hand perfyt In drawing of this nochtie noysum dyt.” So vith this feibile esperance at last sum thing assuagit vas his former fyt, And thus againe on Bridedor he past. The day declynd And nycht approtchit fast; fair tytans steids haid rune thair vtter race, Quhois giltit hairs disparpling bak did cast Throche asurit sky quhilk elss obscuird his face, Till his palle sister Phebe giffing place, Quhan that the pynit Paladeine did tend His course na les Incertaine at this space Than schip but rudder quhilk dois vilsum vend. Bot ?it or he his voyage far did spend, from tops of houssis till him did appeir The smok of fyrie vapeur vp ascend. Bald barking doggis also did he heir, And monie flokis making meikill beir, sum routting loud, And sum did semplie blait. Vnto the village quhan the Compt cam neir, He lychtit doune because it vas so lait, Quhair radelie ane boy discreit and fait Did tak the gydment of his horse in cuir; Sum did desarme his person of estait, Sum loust the giltit spurris quhilk he buir, And Sum attending stuid vpon the fluir for till obey as plesit him command. Now this vas ewen the verray ludging suir, Quhair vondit Medor all his veilfair fand. The stressit knycht All stupefact did stand, And wold to bed but onie kynd of fuid; Sic gripping greif about his bosom band, That appetyt from meit vas far excluid. for fillit full of hawie rancor ruid, He did behold vith goustlie visage palle The vofull vreat, quhilk fri?it vp his bluid; Depaint on posts And vindocks of the hall, On durs, on tabils, And on euerie vall, Both Angelique and Medor schyphert beine, Vith luiflie knottis Interlasit small, In thousand sorts apertlie to be seine. The trublit Comte could not abstract his eine from sycht of that quhilk vrocht him greatest paine, And tending oft to crawe quhat it sould meine, feir for to find his feirfull thocht meed plaine Caust him againe his lippis close restraine. So from him self he vold the treuth oscuir Vith trembling dreid in his perturbit braine sum suadgement schersing be consait vnsuir. Bot Crewall fortone at sic feid him buir, That Scho no paine vold from his persone spair, Bot tuik delyt this Chiftan till InIuir, His musing mynd mischiwing mair and mair. No thing awalit his obfuscat cair Vith cloud of dout quhairin he held his pace, for ane at lenth did all the trewth declair But Inquisition of this cairfull cace; Quhilk vas the pastor, Quho in to that place, Be broikin sychis did persawe his vo, And till appaise his pansiwe spreit ane space, Began the histoir of the luifers tuo; first quhow that Medor, deedlie vondit so, He thair did bring at Angeliques desyre, Quha cuird his hurt; Than quhow that scho did go, for him consuming all in luifis fyre, Sua that of honor thochtles or Impyre Scho to this sempill souldart did Inclyn, And Band wp mariage for to quenche desyre. Thus he the histoir rycht in euerie lyn Did so discus Quhill that hir braslat fyn He representit at that Instant steed. This vas the ax at last descendan syn Vith deedlie dint quhilk did ding of his heed. Lang speitchles lay he strukin almeist deed, Quhill source of sorrow mycht no moir susteine, Bot furiuslie outbirstit but remeed Sobs from his mouth And teiris from his eine. Bot most of all quhan solitar he beine, Ane fluid aboundant bouting out besprent His boudin brest all suellit vp In teine, And both his cheaks bebathing but relent. Deip in him now vas cauld dispair Imprent, ?it from his birnand bosome fast did flow Hote flammyng sychs quhilk neuir could be spent; So fell and feruent vas the fyrie low, Quhilk in his hart ay moir and moir did grow, But onie slaiking thocht it fumit out, his breath bot onlie did as belleis blow To kindle all his bodie round about, And als his eine did serue bot for ane spout The vitale humeur from his lyf to draw. for sorrow suir not cled vith former dout did all his arters view aschunder thraw. Quho may the strese Intolerabile schaw Quhilk did this val?ant varior so torne? leile lychtleit luifers onlie may it knaw, Quho haples fruite of Ielousie hes schorne. In bed he restles tumblit thus forlorne, Quhilk did moir dour than dourest stone appeir; Ilk softest fedder vas as poyntit thorne To prick his persone, or the scharpest breir. The valkryf thochtis of his cair seueir Permits him nocht to sleip ane moment space; Turne as he vold both hither thair and heir, Raidge of his rancor did him ay Imbrace, And in his torment he bethocht, alace, That his vnkyndlie darrest ladie quhyt Haid Interteind hir Medor in this place; Heirfoir the sammyng (plinist vith dispyt) He did abhorre, And from it bendit quyt. As quhan ane pastor schersing eisment lyis Amongs the tender flouris of delyt, Syn at his feit ane yssing serpent spyis, Maist quyklie and astonist vp vill ryis, So Roland full of dolor and desdaine Vith diligence for all his harneis cryis, And in that ludgeing vold no moir remaine, Bot montit on his Bridedor againe, And vold not tarie quhill Aurora brycht Haid spred hir siluer schaddow on the plaine, Bot throch the feilds ryds all this vilsum nycht. He plains, he pains, and as ane furious vycht Blasphems the heawens, the stars, and gods deuyn, Vith trickling teirs beblubring all his sycht, And syching ay Insatiantlie for pyn. ?ea, thocht the morrow cleir arryuit syn, But Interwall his sorrow did Induir. from brochs and citeis far he did declyn, Eschewing sycht of euerie creatuir, To dern deserts And partis maist obscuir Vith vofull vult he vandrit all the day, But onie knawleidge quhair his horse him buir; And with maist griwous great regraitting ay Did fill the heawen, the air, and feilds alway. He fround for furie, feilling in his heed The storms of raidge pelmell about fast play. In vinter Bald Neptunus neuir meed Moir motion fell In fomie fluidis reed, As tumults strong tormoyling to and fro Of braying baile quhilk in his brest abeed, Vith trublit tempest him tormenting so. Than In the nycht quhan all to rest did go He doune descendit in ane bocage greine, Vith cairfull skrychis euir valtring tho; And sic scharp schours of sorrow did susteine, That sleip mycht neuir close his veping eine, Quhairfra ten thowsand teiris did distell, As Quhan from bourn that lang hes dammit beine streams breaks aboundant quhilk thairin did suell. Him self astonit could not think nor tell Quhow possibill so monie teiris mycht Poure from his eis, quhilks lyk ane springing vell Did neuir stay thair rynning day nor nycht. Than syching soir he said, “this liquor brycht Is no moir teirs; Teirs may not end my vo, Quhilk bot begins; And spent ar from my sycht My teiris all. This source quhilk springis so I knaw it is viwe vapor fleing fro The feruent flams, quhilk birns my hart to deed, Vp throch my soddin brest, syn out dois go At my tuo eis, And sall draw but remeed My lyf and dolor both at ons to feed; Bot sen so is, Sched out thy course vith speid, And my vnhappie dayis to end soon leed. And ?e, O sychs, quhairwith my cair dois feid, ?e are no sychs: Sychs may not ay proceid But onie cease As thois that I exspyre. The moir I sych, Moir panting breath dois breid. The lord of luife, Quho birns me all in fyre, Maks vith his vings this vind, And will not tyre To cause my kendlit flammes euir flow Quhill I destroyit be both bon and lyre. Bot O great meruell, that my hart now dow So long Induir in luifis feruent low, And vnconsumit vtterlie to nocht! Bot quhom am I in quhom sic raidge dois grow? am I that Roland quho hes vonders vrocht? No. Roland treulie in his grafe is brocht; His dame Ingrait hes vranguslie him slaine. I am bot onlie his puir spreit afflocht In vildernese heir forcit to complaine. My desperat maist great Infernale paine To beir record be my profoundest vo, Quhat euerie ane may hoip for till attaine, Quho thrallit in the links of luife dois go.” This nycht till end Roland lamentit so, And quhan the vermell Matutina sched In celest hews hir adgeit husband fro, Him lewing sleipand in his donckie bed, And quhan the vorldis lycht began to spred Brycht rubie sparkis throch the purpur sky, Be destenie the Comte haid so beine led That in the part he him persauit ly Besyd the rock, Quhilk he befoir did spy Vith Angelique And Medor grauit all. for force of furie than his flesche did fry; Be dints and stogs of dochtie Durandal The craig and wreat he claiwe in skelpis small. So dois he go hich radgeing in dispyt, And suddanlie to ground renwersit all Quhair onie trait vas of the luiflie dyt. The sauuage pastor And his troup may quyt Cauld cumlie vmbrage of this cawe for ay, And that fair fontan, springand siluer quhyt Vith restles rumor throch the sprutand spray. Thocht recent liquor, clarifeit alway, It spoutit out as colorit christall cleine, ?it could the same in nothing quenche I say The coler fell quhilk in him birnand beine. Great stoks, and stons, And monie brainchis greine Thairin he suackit, And did neuir spair, Quhill all that vattir cleir as Saphir scheine Vas drumlie trublit in ilk conduict clair. Than Irkit full of suet and hawie cair But poust he breathles on the mydow fell, In sorrou sowpit syching sad and sair, Concluding heir continewallie to duell. No heit, No cauld, No raine, Nor vindis snell Mycht mak him ons to leif againe this place, Quhairin he lay (as dois the histoir tell) But speitche, And euir vith affixit face The firmament beholding all the space; And so but meet or drink did still Induir, Quhill that the dririe nycht haid rune hir race Thryse cled in till hir clouddie robbe obscuir, And quhill Apollo thryse haid montit suir In gouldin cart to luminat the day. And grewous rigor Quhilk his bodie buir In feibling him It moir agmentit ay, Quhill at the last all vincust quhair he lay Be paine heirof out of his sens he start, And all his Iudgement from him fled away. Than the fourt day vorking his proper smart, His hands outragius did his visage skart Maist horribile, And vith ane hiddeus brall for raidge he roird, And restles did dispart His scheild, his gantlat, and his corslat tall; Heir fell the brassats, Thair lyis Durandal, Strong nails he breaks, His Cuissots aff did slyd; His helm, His gorget, And his harneis all In thousand peicis he disparplit vyd. Ay moir And moir his furie did him gyd from hour till hour, Quhill It Increscit so That in no part he permanent vold byd, Bot, rawand vodlie, suift and rasche did go. His clothing all And sark he reft him fro, And nakit schew his vombe, his brest, and bak, Vith flyring face his mouth did morgeon tho And syndrie sounds maist terribile did mak, Ay clawerand loud, And not to propose spak. Syn quhan his raidge vold reull him moir seueir, He at ane pull vold suddanlie vptak The greatest oike Or fir that he cam neir As bled of buss Or berrie aff the breir. Great rocks, cawerns, And montans all about He meed resound, And vith ane luik austeir Abaist the pastors, Chaceand euerie rout That for to spy his folie Ischit out; And quhair he cam but mercie or remeed Vprais amongs tham ane maist feirfull schout: Sum vith his fist lay fellit in that steed, Sum dammest doune, Sum bruisit to the deed, Sum gat thair brest quyt broikin, or thair bak, fra sum he puld the arme, the leg, or heed: Syn in his hand the bluidie boulk vold tak, And at ane vther egarlie it suak. Tham ranging thus vith ronklit front vpbend He meed great heaps of this vnhappie pak, And nane of all agains him durst pretend. for as the veyld and furius Ours dois stend But onie feir or sussie for to sie, The Russians hunters tym and trauell spend for to persew hir throche the montans hie; Thocht than approtche hir ane great cumpanie Of litle hounds, Quhowsoon scho blinks about, That feibile sort all skattrit bak dois flie; Ewen so quhan Raging Roland ruschit out The peuple all fast fled in deedlie dout Vith all the speid and diligence thay mycht, And so dissowerit vas this rakless rout.

Both nycht and day he in the feilds abeed, And for to fill his houngrie appetyt fuid quhair he mycht he reft vith great dispyt. Suyft harts and hynds he also vold deuoir, And to the death in rageing furie smyt The sangler strong, The Tygar, Or the Boir, And tham in gobbats gredelie all toir, Thair bluid vpsucking, Quhairvith blubbrit beine His visage quhilk appeird so bawld befoir. far mycht he now defigurat be seine from that Renownit vordie Chiftane keine, Vmquhyle the beild and piller firm of france.

Vith spreit opprest, Quhan I haid done depart from my Renownit Dian maist formose, Quhais companie did reconfort my hart, for plesours past to panse vas my repose. In this estate, vncertane quhat to chose, Dame fortoune led me solitar alon In to ane garth, Quhair fouth of flours vprose Depaint vith hews of monie pretius ston; Sum Rubie Reed, And Sum lyk topas scheine, Sum Iassink hewit, And sum as sapheir blew, In valeis fair all cled vith emerauld greine, Quhois blossums clein maist seimlie schaddows schew; sum purpour fyn, And sum of cramsie hew, Sum quhyt, Sum van, broune, blae, and violat, Vith holsum smell my sensis to renew All glorious gilt in glansing aureat. I did espy thair perfyt properteis, Rycht curabill for all contagius thing; Than said I thus, “O floras tapestreis, Great vertew rair ?our qualiteis dois bring, Bot ?it, helas, no vertew sic dois spring Vithin ?our verdeur as may ons remeed The maladie of luif quhilk dois me vring Vith dalie dolor duynyng to the deed.” Soft vas the seson, Blomit vas the meid, Apollo brycht his baneir so desplayt, That Eolus durst not approtche for dreid: Thair euerie trie agains him stuid arrayt.

The frostie auld Saturnus snell Austeirlie sat amongs the rest, Quhois scharpe seueir resemblance fell Did all the heawenlie Gods molest, Quhois qualetie quyt did expell. Maist gentill Iowe the forme did tell; “Ve vill,” (sayis he), “bring to this place Sum amiabill man discreit, Quhois plesand speitche And cumlie face May all our sour translait in sueit: Than chose him at this instant space, Quho is adornd vith euerie grace; And I my Egle sall derect Doune from the loftie skyis cleir, for to transport this man elect To be deificat vp heir.” That gratious Gods than did expect fair Phebus vill in this effect, Quho promeissit to scherse him far, In compassing this vorld about, Quho mycht Saturnus baill debar.

Behold this diwelische dolorus degres And sentence mad, Quhilk thay do all profes; As beists but reson beistlie is thair sens, for Iudgementles is all thair cair expres Thair blisles bodies delicat to dres, And euerie perfyt pleasour pas thay hens To liwe in lycht licencious Insolens. for conscience cause than, thocht my vit vas small, I schouttit loud this harrang to tham all: “O folische fleschlie And most schamles sort, So suelling in ?our sensuall solace schort, Obscuir ?e liwe, And laiks the lycht deuyn. ?our nochtie naturs coustumat to tort No God cognoscis, Bot ?our game and sport ?our sensles sensis onlie dois Inclyn To valk in velth vachting the vychtest vyn, Vith euerie protigaletie repleit, But all regarde to the suppressit spreit. “?our erdlie corps, Quharof ?e hawe sic cair, Vnto ?our saull ?e sould nocht mak compair.
