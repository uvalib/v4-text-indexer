      <field name="fulltext">Scalpat qui tangitur. EPIGRAMS. Ãgrotans, nolens. Could Bond the Scrivener find no time to come To S?. Iohn Opus, but on's physick day, When he should take a purge? Hang him base scum, Is that a time when men their debts should pay? Goe tell the Scoundrell from S? Iohn agen His Worship leaues off purging none knows when. Ferendo fortior. Galla twice maried, is become much stronger, And in her labours like to hold out longer, Who by this new match makes the prouerb full, She that hath borne a Calfe, beares now a Bull. FÅlix donec. While Turnus feasted, not a guest durst faile him But being arested, not a guest durst bail him. Fiat necesse. Sextus hath sold his Coach and horses foure, W?? needs must vnto Need be thoght th' induction For of expence there prou'd none other power, Besides, t'was that first drew him to destruction. Verbum, summis. Young Lelio left but sixpence in aduance, That was to feast it at the Golden Fleece: Comes to the Bar with brauing countenance, Saying, Sirra Drawer, canst thou change a peece? Orâsince for siluer we are not so strong, Scor't vp: Ile send it by my man-Tom Long. Uerbosus scabiosus. Marcus would needs maintain, Store was no sore That had his fingers fraught w? scabs great store To whom (quoth one) This proues you sir a lyer, For too much store makes you a scuruy Squire. Sublata causa, &amp;c. VVhy studies Siluester no more the Lawes? Tis thoght Duck-lane has tane away y? cause Peccans errans. Monseur Patricius is to Venice gone, What to do there think you? faith look vpon The Walls and Buildings: not for any feare, Vnlesse you'll vrge't t'was to saue hanging here. Filia Grammaticalis. No more need Pontus pawne his gown or cloak His wiues best linnen, or her wedding ring; Vnlesse the Deuill hath still the same forespoake, As an ordain'd ineuitable thing. For why? his daughter, past her Moods and Tenses, (Comming to Possum) payes for all expences. Grauida, intacta. Bindo still beats his Maids beyond excesse, All but this last and late-come little Besse, Of whom it's wondred much how Bindo delt, That she with child, his waight yet neuer felt: Equitans-ambulans. VVhy wears Wat one boot vp, another down? Cause th' ones to ride whiles th' other staies in towne. Dubius decipiens. Ianus must iesting still equiuocate, Which he alludes as doubtfull termes of art, Being a custome he hath got of late, But to the Devill he beares an honest heart. Armatus, animosus. When Lanus lights by ch?ce vpon some cheat, And hath his pockets lin'd with least of chink His stomacke then endures no common meat, Or possibly digests your sodden drinke, Till forst againe remoue towards the fields, Finds no such victuals as his Alehouse yeelds. Deridens deridendus. If Lollus leaue not those his flowts and frumps, Which haue so oft been worn euen to the stumps. Let it not vex him if reuenge be such, That others play vpon his wife as much. Calvus incastus. Not chaste nor secret Calvus? well take heed Thou proue nor last a bald-pate knaue indeed. Pulchra quÃ¦ vtilia. Mercutio maruels what men meane, to buy So many bookes of such diuersity; When Almanacks (saith he) yeelds all the sense Of times best profit, and experience. Facies, forum. Pvt case Penelope be poore descended, Where find you such another more compares For comelinesse, or is the like befriended, With Knights and Gallants that bespeak her wares? Shew me that Sempster if you ere haue seene her, Hath had like takings for a young-beginner. Charum Diuersorium. Creta lets lodgings, but at such a rate As may maintaine Mal, Su, Bess, Dol, and Kate, Whom purposely she keeps in such a plight, As may content best commers in at night. Uerba vana. Pru could content you, as fit time affords, But to deale plain, she'l not be paid with words. InÃ¦quale Connubium. Paulus is wedded to a wench, as pretty As he himselfe is generous and witty: But here's the ods, she'll trade, so will not he, And that's it makes them so much disagree. Moretrix mÅsta. Parnel complaines not halfe so much of wants, As spitefull dealings late in publike knowne, By Bridewell Beadles: slaues and Sycophants, That durst so vex her, vsing but her owne; When thousands more haue trod awry the shoo, Alas poore whore, what would you haue her doe? Maritus mitior. Kind Kester carying Kate his wife behind him, To post-salute her would oft backwards wind him: Whereby the cockscombe might be thought more kind, That he before should kisse her so behind. Visum ignotum. That Cambro's wife's w? child, her belly shows it, But who was't got it? pray ask those y? knows it Peccans culpans. How bitter spake sir Tristram th' other day, To George his m? that w?t (he thought) astray Alledging, no such obiects could so wooe him: True, for he has the gowt, his drab comes to him. Signa super sunt. Priscus giues out he hence to Prague is gone, Vpon a wager of aduentrous chance: But Priscus lurkes (more shame to think vpon) With Kate his old comrague in Petty France: Yet of his trauels meanes at large relate, At least is sure to bring certificate. Serio at non. Dol with much dalliance must and wil dispense, Dealing on matters deeper consequence. Invita Senectus. Old Dromo bids adieu to day delights, Growne much decrepid; fitter far for nights: Who forst must now his worne out limbs retire, And volens-nolens feed but on desire. Ebria fragilior. VVho sayes Carina liues incontinent, Or proues the least to such a busines bent: Because she lodgings lets to Gentlemen That may be iesting with her now and then? Be it defiance to his very face, Shall touch Carina in such kind of case. Indeed if drunke a man will question that, A woman then may doe she knowes nor what. Duplex dubium. Sislie's with child she's sure, but knowes not whether By her late husband, or this man, or neither. Birlady wench th' adst need both doubt and feare, For twixt them both the businesse did appeare. Idonius Capistro. Brutus denies his birth and parentage, Growne vp a gallant iust at hanging age. Debita desperata. Questus hath tane vp more this last vacation, In Mercers shops, then all his meanes amounts Who being askt to pay, and in what fashion, All he can say, is, Put it in accompts. Chara Coniux. Nicholas that purchast for his new wife Nan A little Dog, a Squirrell, and a Fan, Contents her not, but must haue (se invito) A Muffe, a Munky, and a Parakito: Which to defray, the foole perforce is drawne, Although he lay the siluer spoone to pawne. Breuius Dulcius. Dacus endures not any long discourse, which his impatience would too much inforce The end or cloze aymes he at, good or ill, All but the Tauerne and his Taylors bill. Luxuria prÃ¦cipua. Kit cares not though his trechery be knowne, So you'll but let his letchery alone. Nesutor vltra. Gorgonius brags what wonders he would doe, Were but his purse halfe answerable to His noble thoughts: Pish, prethee foole it lesse, And follow on the trade thou dost professe. Mouens mobilis. VVhat art thou like (my Lidea) or whereto Shall I compare thee, as I faine would do: Vnto a Swan? a Lilly? or a Rose? No, Lidea scornes to be compar'd to those: Ile tell thee Lidea (so thou wilt not frowne) Iust to an Houre-glasse that's still vp and downe. Egenus Poeta. Tassus writes verses vpon great mens praise, And in that exercise spends most his dayes: For whom you'll aske? That would be vnderstood. Faith for whos'ere giues money to buy food. Ius, iniuria. Crassus of lands holds lawfull now possession: True, got by law, but lost by much oppression. Fortior, formidabilis. Qvimetuit odit, doth the prouerb goe. Which might of Caius carefull be debated, If any durst but tell the Caitiffe so: Pish hang him he'll be fear'd, though nere so hated. Chara, vilis. Priscilla sprung from pitch of highest top, Scorning your proud late gallants to conuerse with, Now lowly keeps a poore Tobacco shop, For foot-boyes, grooms, &amp; cullions to c?merse with But you must note she's poore and grown in yeares, As by the rules of ragged times appeares. Ãgrotans fortior. Cantus our Cobler being lately sicke, One meeting him, desir'd to vnderstand The cause of his disease: quoth he, a cricke Hath pain'd me, but am now o'th mending hand. Eques solis. Bernard for boots with London coblers barters, Which st?d in stead of stockins, shoos, &amp; garters Obligatus alligatus. Day break, and break of day, all one should be, But tis not so with Ferdinand we see: Who chancing thus of late to break his day, Was all the cause why he in Ludgate lay. Deteriora malis. Dicke truly swore he was not drunke this week, Chalkt not one penny vpon any score, Playd not a game at Tables, Bowles, or Gleek, No not a foot stept from his chamber doore: Long of that scuruy Laundresse, so to deale, As hauing but one shirt, she that must steale. Viatores infÅlitiores. Scruto that skilfull-seeming man in arts, And Traueller, twice all those countries bin in, Would any creature iudge one of his parts So lowsie should become for want of linnen? Dolor intimus. Not hauk, nor hound, nor horse, those letters hhh But ache it selfe tis Brutus bones attaches. Propriora meliora. Mechus that meanes to pocket vp no wrongs, But money, and what else to him belongs, May pocket vp these Rimes, and be no foole, They nearer him concerne then A-iax stoole. Pignus secretum. Mistris Mordina whispered in mine eare, About a businesse she was loath to vtter, Vnlesse to silence it I first would sweare, And therewithall in some assurance put her. Twas but to lend her so much, like a Noddy, For which she ventrous would haue pawnd her body. Viuis viuens. Proud Dorothea take it not in scorn, Th' art like a Biere that on mens backs is born; Only this difference thou maist inforce, The Biere beares those are dead, thou the quicke corse. Additio perditio. From Mal but merry, men but mirth deriue, For trix tis makes her proue demonstratiue. Fallacior cautior. Darcas hath dealt on promises so oft As she'll no more the cunningst cozener close with, Till it appeare there be a licence brought, Witnesse the fourth big belly that she goes with. Rosa, Spina. Admit Fardella for her face and feature Be so vnparalleld esteem'd a creature, She's yet for all those attributes no more Then an attractiue fine wel-fauour'd?: And that too many can too feeling tell, Since she too lately lodg'd in Clarkenwell. Splendida spoliis. Clim clad of late in Petticoats of wollen, Is now with silks &amp; sattins grown more sullen, Who being askt how such might purchas'd be, Faith onely for the taking vp (quoth she.) Plagis mitior. Katherine that grew so curst and fit for no man, With beating soone became a gentle-woman. Aspirans desperans. Better vnknighted (had sir Giles first thought it) Th? thus proue bankrupt who so dearly bought it, But that his old blacke Gillian ere she dy'd Must needs forsooth in hast be Ladifi'd. Iuvenis tonsus. That Petrus proues so bald, and yet so yong, What one who sees him may but wonder at it, Knowing how late his haire was thick and long: Tut, come, tis quickly question'd whence he got it, Not by the Barbers rasor, nor his knife, But very neere, t'was by the Barbers wife. Antiqua ignota. Ienkin must needs proue Gentleman, and why? By ancient rules fetcht from Antiquity: True; if so ancient as we doe not know, Ienkins gentility must needs be so. O creatus esuriens. Of Ben that braues it in white boots, it's mutterd He feeds at home on Carret roots vnbutterd. Pecunia prÃ¦valens. Hand off Sir Sauce-box: Think you M?s Phips Allowes such Lobs as you to touch her lips? But then its question'd further, If you bring her Some Legem pone, that's another thing sir. Mortua, mutata. Svrdus this point will still insist vpon, Though Ioane his wife and he hate one another; Yet ought they howsoere be both as one, For that such matters maried men should smother: Vntill she dead shall with the Devill remaine, Then must they be no longer one but twaine. Esuriens avidus. Let kitchin Kate proue nere so foule or common All's one to Clogo, if she be a woman: Who standing least on fashions finicall, Falls to his businesse like a Naturall. Par, pari. Sir Miles his mens heads breaks for ought amiss, But then tis Quid pro quo; his maids break his. Emens cogens. Why blame you Iaques of so iust a deed, As to prouide for matters necessary? He did not buy his breeches without need, For true it was, he could no longer tary. Pristina obliuiscens. Pretus aspir'd to office, thinkes no more On those abhorred country Carts and Plowes, No not vpon the best of weeds he wore But th' other day: his place more worth allowes. What cares he who repines, or be agrieu'd, Things are not now as when Andrea liu'd. Conscientia testis. What makes Anthonio deeme himselfe vndone, Be'ng quest'ned since his office first begun: But that a conscience tels him, QuÃ¦ sumuntur Tam male parta, male dilabuntur. Genitoris nesciens. Tom askes no fathers blessing, if you note him, And wiser he vnlesse he knew who got him. Non Aquila Muscas, &amp;c. A bucksome Lady of the last Edition, Woo'd by her Seruingman, his suit denies, Bidding him know (with humble more submission) That soaring Eagles scorne to catch at flyes. Credenti satis. Young Gallatea matcht with old S? Iohn, A goodly, sweet, and louely babe hath brought him, Which makes so many muse so much vpon, That for these twelue yeeres haue vnable thought him Surely there's then some other supportation, Or meerly must be done by inspiration. Credens suadens. Mad iealous Mopsus, a man seene in arts, Was told by one, his Wife had worthy parts, To which he more outragious makes reply, How should this Rascall such her parts descry?

Instabilis stans. Mat being drunken much his anger wreakes On's wife; but stands to nothing that he speaks Reus sine re.

Bartellus bragging how he liu'd by's wit, And nere was yet for least offence committed, Is now past hope, there's nought can him acquit, But must at last be needs for Tiburne fitted. Alius, altior.

Drusus not deignes the least of retrospect On these rude rimes, he doth so much reiect Whether more strange I know not, or vnkind, But Drusus feares he here himselfe doth find. Infundo cineres. Str?ge was it (Mun) thy mother broght forth thee Mongst all her children so deform'd a creature, For how indeed can it but wondred be, That she so faire, thou shouldst be of that feature: The reason may be thus (if not too grosse) There was no mettall left besides the drosse. Bonum pro malo. Parnel in publike questioning my name, Sayes in her anger she has done with me: But Ile not be reueng'd so much for shame, To tell the world what I haue done with thee. Empta nostra. Madam la Foy weares not those locks for nought Ask at the shop else where the same she bought Vt caput crimina. Of thee Sir Miles too much cannot be said, For medling with black Besse the kitchin maid No more those dealings are discernd of late, Then is that periwig vpon thy pate. Dubiens decipiens. Why should young Lelio think I loue him not, Or with the least of iealousie suppose, These Rymes of mine so rude and mis-begot, Should like strong mustard take him by the nose: Sure there's some matter in't w?? makes him doubt, He such a stinckard should be so smelt out. Vtcun? superbus. Proud Celso knowes since his aspiring state, That those who fear him most, do most him hate Yet scornes to take it least for counter-checke, Though change hereafter chance to break his neck. Principia sordida. Bassus of lands good store, and leases, farmes, whose mother milkpails bore ere he bore armes Experto credendum. How durst Capritius call his wedlock whore, But that he speakes it plus quam per narratum, Nam ipso teste: what require you more, Vnlesse you'ld haue it magis approbatum. Tandem vlciscatur. How durst you call in question mistris Maud, Because her name a little was disgrac'd? Put case her mother prov'd a kind of B. Must that conclude her ere the more vnchast? Wel, luck (she doubts not) but may one day lend her To find that flat-cap out which shall defend her. Vt freta, fortuna. Ask Dacus how his luck at dicing goes, Like to the Tide (saith he) it ebbs and flowes; Then I suppose the same cannot be good, For all men knows tis longer ebbe then flood. Pecunia prÃ¦valens. Tell Tom of Platoes worth, or Aristotles? Hang't, giue him wealth enough, let wit stop botles Ortus indicans. Deriue thy pedegre. (Hugh) nere so high From great Cadwallider, or Brutus sonne, Thou canst not blaze it from true Heraldry, But wilt a Bastard proue when all is done. Admiretur vulgus. Magus a man of artificiall trade, Most confident beleeues, and will auerre, These Epigrams of mine are meant and made By persons knowne, in each particuler: Come (Magus) thou hast borne a iealous head Ere since thy wife was found with one a bed. Eadem cupiens. Maria meanes to match with such a mome, As shall not tax her in the least behauour, Neither for matters past, nor what's to come: Prouided, y'are a queane (Mal) by your fauour. Porcis proclivis. Priscilla proues to pigs flesh much inclin'd, Doubtlesse descended from some hoggish kind. Debitum consuetum. Tib scornes be taxt for dearnesse in her trade, That takes for hire but as your Hackney Iade, Prouided you depart ere candle-light, Or pay her double, if you stay all night. Vestigia matris. That Tom'sin's turn'd true trul who would beleeue Or to those outward looks least credit giue, That not attaind to yet full fourteene yeeres, So duly drabs it, drinkes, and domineers; Acting her Mothers steps, as on a stage, Who had a Bastard iust about that age. Vt cornua crines. Mat will maintain, that horns and hory haires come by haphazard, much more th? by yeres Inuita chasta. Mildred from mariage meanes her selfe abiure, For certaine reasons she's asham'd to speake, And which remedilesse she cannot cure, Lesse able hold but needs perforce must l? Verbum sat. Be prouder still (young Spruso) spite of foes; What? pull thy selfe already by the nose? As if some fatall Oracle foretold, Thou hast too long beene malepertly bold: Well: take it then, and thankfull goe thy way, Thou knowst well (Spruso) what I worse could say Eques Solis. Sir Sol can dance, and turne, and stoutly eat, But cannot foole halfe well to earne his meat, Plead almes (Sir Sol) where thou maist get a dinner Or starue thy selfe, thou canst not look more thinner Trahens officina. Sardinios wife Tobacco sells for fashion, But keepes a house of other occupation. Facile responsum.

A booke of Epigrams, and made by me? Its some sweet stuffe, dares William warrant ye Who nere least meddles or will haue to doe With what opinion leads him not vnto: But William seem'd not well to vnderstand, When's wife was purchas'd at the second hand. Patiens armatus. Egidius will proue patient spite of fortune, Let worst of ch?ce him nere so much importune He'll be the same in losing as in winning, A patient C?from the first beginning. Tandem manifestum. Kath'rine that hid those candles out of sight, Might well conceiue they'll come at length to light. Veritas subverta. Lvke that a man on horse-backe met but late, Would simply seeme thus to equiuocate, And str?g maintain gainst who c?tend should dare Twas meerly but a Taylor and a Mare. HÃ¦c fabula non. Acton Acteon-like keepes Hounds to hunt, Not to be puld downe as Acteon was: That were a businesse would appeare too blunt, By Poets fain'd, but nere seene come to passe: Th' one of Diana ancient stories tell, Th' other of Anne his wife is knowne too well. Canis ad vomitum. Lampus that left his lowzy occupation, And liues now (as you see) in other fashion: Must yet resume his natures former habit, Which either vseth to be drunk, or drab it. Ebria, prostrata. Francke at first motion no mans face endures, But being drunke, she's then for euer yours. Stabilis fiducia. Quintus will needs be knowne a man of trust That stands vpon his credit firme and iust. Indeed I oft haue heard the Chandler talke, How firme his credit stands vpon the chalke. Empta pÅnitentia. Iacke to his Iug in feeling passion swore, He would approue her a polluted? Whose tempting outward looks, &amp; borrowed locks, And inwardly defil'd, giuen him the?

Must she proue packhorse for all kind of men? Yes more then time they think her as their owne: Alas her cariage hath beene too well knowne. Fragilis, Lubrica. Sib much disdaines the world should find her slip, But (Sib) tis knowne who had you on the hip. Satis optasse.

Sublimis prostratus. Mounseur Lorenzo since his office lost, Wherein of late he liu'd a great Comander, Walkes discontented like the angry ghost Of proud Tarquinius, or Pope Alexander: Whom Fates enuying should so domineere, Haue flung downe headlong with a full carere. QuÃ¦data, nostra. Brutus c?plain'd his wife did nought him bring Or since her mariage gaue him any thing: To whom (quoth she) y'are much to blame to braul, Bring I not boyes without your helpe at all? CitÃ² benÃ¨. Sir Iohn at Mattins prayes he might dispatch, Who by true promise is to bowle a match. Nocte latent mendÃ¦. That Susans ruffes and cuffes should so much cost, Hauing but two poore lockram smockes at most, Its much admir'd; but that the one in sight, Obscures the other best by candle-light. Tandem solutus. Ask swaggering Sulmo why no debts he'll pay, His answer is, Things must be as they may: Let Bils or Nouerints sink (saith he) or swim, H'ell not his Laundresse pay: But she payd him. Infirmis animosus. Pontus by no meanes from his coyne departs, Zfut will ye haue of men more then their harts? Vxor superior. Wh? Nan finds Nicholas drunk she straight cornutes him, Nor from her scolding in an houre can cease: But if Nick call her Punk her words confutes him, So that the Cockscomb's forst to hold his peace. Antonius Philosophus. Old Clerco sues for pension of the State, For it he pleads the wit he sometime had, Who though he haue a flawed riuen pate, Yet will not I (as others) call him mad, Nor pull his beard, nor vse him like a sot, This is the onely cause he loues me not. Longius pro lucro. Goe follow Lucius a far off thy Lord, What thogh thy place be not to speak a word Yet for a silent Pander proud maist be, His Lordship deignes to make that vse of thee. Equus peritior. Gill by his Gelding drowning scap't perforce, Who reason had to say, Gramarcy horse. Primus vel proximus. Dick's not in town when's wife is broght in bed But might no doubt be when she first was sped Vsus natura. Tristram Tobacco takes in's bed till noone, Then rising dines, drinks drunk, &amp; fals to dice, Sweares he'll not budge till all be lost or won: Sees next a Play, or Kate his Cockatrice: Sups at some Bawdy house, and Panders meets, That picks his pockets, as he's homewards led: Cals th? a thousand rogues: reels throgh the streets, Drinks more Tobacco, spues, and goes to bed. Diues-scurra. Dru dares good men depraue because he's rich, Whether more fool or knaue I know not w??. Sat fuisse. Thogh Steel for str?gth hath l?g since spent his prime Yet was a man of mettall in his time. Mutatus, alius. Young Signior Spruso scorning late conuerse With men of vulgar trade, or meane commerse, Scorning to lodge but on a bed of Downe, Scorning your Innes of common country towne, Scorning but on best delicates to feed, Yea scorning almost, any thing indeed: Now poore and prostitute, you may beleeue him, In Wood-street C?pter, scorns no alms you'l giue him Edens vomens. Cacus that sups so duely at the Rose, Casts vp the reckning truly ere he goes. Citius soluendum. Trocus his Tenants will no more pay rent, Till for their Wiues he first giue them content: It's reason Trocus without coyne disbursing, Get them with child and nere allow for nursing? Suum cui?. Hang't tell not me quoth Pontus what I owe, Nor what I spend, nor what I meane to pay, So little cares he what the vulgar know, Or can reueale: Things must be as they may, Let slaues infer the worst they can vpon't, His Dol's his Dol and there's the humor on't. Infirmis experientia. Old Strato stands vpon his tackling stout, He can as well as erst he could hold out: To whom quoth Ioane his wife, men laugh that win, Tis knowne you cannot halfe so well hold in. Magnus statura. Lvscus for largenesse of his limbs and bone, At grasse time next growes vp to twenty one, Tonsores pauperiores. Cvtbert admires how Lawyers get so much, And that his commings in should not be such, Who hath beene knowne a poler and a shauer These forty yeares, yet nere could proue a sauer. Fatales PoetÃ¦. VVitches &amp; Poets coimbrace like fate Reputed base, bare, poore, vnfortunate, In these respects I may my selfe intrude, Among the Poets thickest multitude. Admonita peior. Priss dares thus plainely to the world appeale, Since women that deale plaine are balladizd, Sheele with the world no longer plainly deale, Or mongst plaine dealing people be comprizd. Tria mala. The Whore, Tobacco and strong waters meet, Like three grand Plagues almost in euery street. Laudes cum labe. Caius commends his Mistris many wayes, To be the mirror of admired praise: Wer't not for two foule reasons that ensue, Shee's sometimes drunke, and playes the W. Patientia Vindicta. Cvcullus euermore will cary sway Ouer his wife in strangers company: And on her lips his loathed fingers lay, Which patient she puts vp in policy: But with herselfe resolu'd in secret vowes, To pay him next day soundly on the browes. Mutuans Meretrix. When Dol wants money she desires to borrow No more then (damne her) sheele repay tomorrow Citius matura. Madge at fifteen a mayd? should men abhor her she vows &amp; swears it, twere but fitting for her Perditum tempus. Vincent hath wrung the wooll of his inuention, And cannot find least liquid substance left, That to succeeding hopes makes further mention, So barren are his braines of sense bereft: And which is worse, twas to haue paid the score For meat and drinke he to so many owes, That henceforth vows to credit him no more: Then how to shift full little Uincent knowes: But must despairing, raile vpon the Muses, That of his time hath made no better vses. Vxor fortior. Will by the wars would seeme a dominierer, But An his wife hath bin the Ancient bearer Merx concelata. Codrus at Christmas casts vp his accounts, What he hath clearly got the yeere before, But neuer notes what's wiues receipts amounts, Which valued would arise to ten times more. Indeed his wares in open shop were sold, Whiles she scarce hers in priuate durst vnfold. [How much might men commend the worth of those] How much might men commend the worth of those, That well could pen their Epigrams in prose, For many Rimes roue oft so far from reason, As but of times consisting are, not season. Ad Momum. Maist thou nere read my lines, or hear them read, Or see them (Momus) for I wish thee dead. Coacta ferenda. These Rimes you see, vnknown, compos'd, conceall'd, Had nere by me beene showne, disclos'd, reueald, Much lesse at latter Lammas past in print, Had not some secret reason since beene in't: Which volens nolens caus'd me afterwards Shuffle againe, and deale about the Cards.
