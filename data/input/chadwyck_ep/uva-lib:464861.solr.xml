      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME THE FIRST. THE ART OF PRESERVING HEALTH. BOOK I. AIR. Daughter of PÃ¦on, queen of every joy, Hygeia; Hygeia, the goddess of health, was, according to the genealogy of the heathen deities, the daughter of Ãsculapius; who, as well as Apollo, was distinguished by the name of PÃ¦on. whose indulgent smile sustains The various race luxuriant nature pours, And on th' immortal essences bestows Immortal youth; auspicious, O descend! Thou chearful guardian of the rolling year, Whether thou wanton'st on the western gale, Or shak'st the rigid pinions of the north, Diffusest life and vigour thro' the tracts Of air, thro' earth, and ocean's deep domain. When thro' the blue serenity of heaven Thy power approaches, all the wasteful host Of Pain and Sickness, squalid and deform'd, Confounded sink into the loathsome gloom, Where in deep Erebus involv'd the Fiends Grow more profane. Whatever shapes of death, Shook from the hideous chambers of the globe, Swarm thro' the shudd'ring air: whatever plagues Or meagre famine breeds, or with slow wings Rise from the putrid watry element, The damp waste forest, motionless and rank, That smothers earth and all the breathless winds, Or the vile carnage of th' inhuman field; Whatever baneful breathes the rotten south; Whatever ills th' extremes or sudden change Of cold and hot, or moist and dry produce; They fly thy pure effulgence: they and all The secret poisons of avenging heaven, And all the pale tribes halting in the train Of Vice and heedless Pleasure: or if aught The comet's glare amid the burning sky, Mournful eclipse, or planets ill-combin'd, Portend disastrous to the vital world; Thy salutary power averts their rage, Averts the general bane: and but for thee Nature would sicken, nature soon would die. Without thy chearful active energy No rapture swells the breast, no Poet sings, No more the maids of Helicon delight. Come then with me, O Goddess heavenly gay! Begin the song; and let it sweetly flow, And let it wisely teach thy wholesome laws: âHow best the sickle fabric to support âOf mortal man; in healthful body how âA healthful mind the longest to maintain.â 'Tis hard, in such a strife of rules, to chuse The best, and those of most extensive use; Harder in clear and animated song Dry philosophic precepts to convey. Yet with thy aid the secret wilds I trace Of nature, and with daring steps proceed Thro' paths the muss never trod before. Nor should I wander doubtful of my way, Had I the lights of that sagacious mind Which taught to check the pestilential fire, And quell the deadly Python of the Nile. O thou belov'd by all the graceful arts, Thou long the fav'rite of the healing powers, Indulge, O Mead! a well-design'd essay, Howe'er imperfect: and permit that I My little knowledge with my country share, Till you the rich Asclepian stores unlock, And with new graces dignify the theme. YE who amid this feverish world would wear A body free of pain, of cares a mind; Fly the rank city, shun its turbid air; Breathe not the chaos of eternal smoke And volatile corruption, from the dead, The dying, sickning, and the living world Exhal'd, to sully heaven's transparent dome With dim mortality. It is not Air That from a thousand lungs reeks back to thine, Sated with exhalations rank and fell, The spoil of dunghills, and the putrid thaw Of nature; when from shape and texture she Relapses into fighting elements: It is not Air, but floats a nauseous mass Of all obscene, corrupt, offensive things. Much moisture hurts; but here a sordid bath, With oily rancour fraught, relaxes more The solid frame than simple moisture can. Besides, immur'd in many a sullen bay That never felt the freshness of the breeze, This slumbring Deep remains, and ranker grows With sickly rest: and (tho' the lungs abhor To drink the dun fuliginous abyss) Did not the acid vigour of the mine, Roll'd from so many thundring chimneys, tame The putrid steams that overswarm the sky; This caustic venom would perhaps corrode Those tender cells that draw the vital air, In vain with all their unctuous rills bedew'd; Or by the drunken venous tubes, that yawn In countless pores o'er all the pervious skin Imbib'd, would poison the balsamic blood, And rouse the heart to every fever's rage. While yet you breathe, away; the rural wilds Invite; the mountains call you, and the vales; The woods, the streams, and each ambrosial breeze That fans the ever undulating sky; A kindly sky! whose fost'ring power regales Man, beast, and all the vegetable reign. Find then some Woodland scene where nature smiles Benign, where all her honest children thrive. To us there wants not many a happy Seat! Look round the smiling land, such numbers rise We hardly fix, bewilder'd in our choice. See where enthron'd in adamantine state, Proud of her bards, imperial Windsor sits; There chuse thy seat, in some aspiring grove Fast by the slowly-winding Thames; or where Broader she laves fair Richmond's green retreats, (Richmond that sees an hundred villas rise Rural or gay). O! from the summer's rage O! wrap me in the friendly gloom that hides Umbrageous Ham!âBut if the busy Town Attract thee still to toil for power or gold, Sweetly thou mayst thy vacant hours possess In Hampstead, courted by the western wind; Or Greenwich, waving o'er the winding flood; Or lose the world amid the sylvan wilds Of Dulwich, yet by barbarous arts unspoil'd. Green rise the Kentish hills in chearful air; But on the marshy plains that Lincoln spreads Build not, nor rest too long thy wand'ring feet. For on a rustic throne of dewy turf, With baneful fogs her aching temples bound, Quartana there presides: a meagre Fiend Begot by Eurus, when his brutal force Compress'd the slothful Naiad of the Fens. From such a mixture sprung, this fitful pest With fev'rish blasts subdues the sickning land: Cold tremors come, with mighty love of rest, Convulsive yawnings, lassitude, and pains That sting the burden'd brows, fatigue the loins, And rack the joints and every torpid limb; Then parching heat succeeds, till copious sweats O'erflow: a short relief from former ills. Beneath repeated shocks the wretches pine; The vigour sinks, the habit melts away; The chearful, pure, and animated bloom Dies from the face, with squalid atrophy Devour'd, in sallow melancholy clad. And oft the Sorceress, in her sated wrath, Resigns them to the furies of her train; The bloated Hydrops, and the yellow Fiend Ting'd with her own accumulated gall. In quest of Sites, avoid the mournful plain Where osiers thrive, and trees that love the lake; Where many lazy muddy rivers flow: Nor for the wealth that all the Indies roll Fix near the marshy margin of the main. For from the humid soil and watry reign Eternal vapours rise; the spungy air For ever weeps: or, turgid with the weight Of waters, pours a sounding deluge down. Skies such as these let every mortal shun Who dreads the dropsy, palsy, or the gout, Tertian, corrosive scurvy, or moist catarrh; Or any other injury that grows From raw-spun fibres idle and unstrung, Skin ill-perspiring, and the purple flood In languid eddies loitering into phlegm. Yet not alone from humid skies we pine; For Air may be too dry. The subtle heaven, That winnows into dust the blasted downs, Bare and extended wide without a stream, Too fast imbibes th' attenuated lymph Which, by the surface, from the blood exhales. The lungs grow rigid, and with toil essay Their flexible vibrations; or inflam'd, Their tender ever-moving structure thaws. Spoil'd of its limpid vehicle, the blood A mass of lees remains, a drossy tide That slow as Lethe wanders thro' the veins; Unactive in the services of life, Unfit to lead its pitchy current thro' The secret mazy channels of the brain. The melancholic fiend (that worst despair Of physic), hence the rust-complexion'd man Pursues, whose blood is dry, whose fibres gain Too stretch'd a tone: and hence in climes adust So sudden tumults seize the trembling nerves, And burning fevers glow with double rage. Fly, if you can, these violent extremes Of Air; the wholesome is nor moist nor dry. But as the power of chusing is deny'd To half mankind, a further task ensues; How best to mitigate these fell extremes, How breathe unhurt the withering element, Or hazy atmosphere: Tho' Custom moulds To ev'ry clime the soft Promethean clay; And he who first the fogs of Essex breath'd (So kind is native air) may in the fens Of Essex from inveterate ills revive At pure Montpelier or Bermuda caught. But if the raw and oozy heaven offend: Correct the soil, and dry the sources up Of watry exhalation; wide and deep Conduct your trenches thro' the quaking bog; Sollicitous, with all your winding arts, Betray th' unwilling lake into the stream; And weed the forest, and invoke the winds To break the toils where strangled vapours lie; Or thro' the thickets send the crackling flames. Mean time at home with chearful fires dispel The humid air: And let your table smoke With solid roast or bak'd; or what the herds Of tamer breed supply; or what the wilds Yield to the toilsome pleasures of the chase. Generous your wine, the boast of rip'ning years; But frugal be your cups: the languid frame, Vapid and sunk from yesterday's debauch, Shrinks from the cold embrace of watry heavens. But neither these nor all Apollo's arts, Disarm the dangers of the dropping sky, Unless with exercise and manly toil You brace your nerves, and spur the lagging blood. The fat'ning clime let all the sons of ease Avoid; if indolence would wish to live. Go, yawn and loiter out the long slow year In fairer skies. If droughty regions parch The skin and lungs, and bake the thickening blood; Deep in the waving forest chuse your seat, Where fuming trees refresh the thirsty air; And wake the fountains from their secret beds, And into lakes dilate the rapid stream. Here spread your gardens wide; and let the cool, The moist relaxing vegetable store Prevail in each repast: Your food supplied By bleeding life, be gently wasted down, By soft decoction and a mellowing heat, To liquid balm; or, if the solid mass You chuse, tormented in the boiling wave; That thro' the thirsty channels of the blood A smooth diluted chyle may ever flow. The fragrant dairy from its cool recess Its nectar acid or benign will pour To drown your thirst; or let the mantling bowl Of keen Sherbet the fickle taste relieve. For with the viscous blood the simple stream Will hardly mingle; and fermented cups Oft dissipate more moisture than they give. Yet when pale seasons rise, or winter rolls His horrors o'er the world, thou may'st indulge In feasts more genial, and impatient broach The mellow cask. Then too the scourging air Provokes to keener toils than sultry droughts Allow. But rarely we such skies blaspheme. Steep'd in continual rains, or with raw fogs Bedew'd, our seasons droop: incumbent still A ponderous heaven o'erwhelms the sinking soul. Lab'ring with storms in heapy mountains rise Th' imbattled clouds, as if the Stygian shades Had left the dungeon of eternal night, Till black with thunder all the South descends. Scarce in a showerless day the heavens indulge Our melting clime; except the baleful East Withers the tender spring, and sourly checks The fancy of the year. Our fathers talk Of summers, balmy airs, and skies serene. Good heaven! for what unexpiated crimes This dismal change! The brooding elements Do they, your powerful ministers of wrath, Prepare some fierce exterminating plague? Or is it fix'd in the Decrees above That lofty Albion melt into the main? Indulgent Nature! O difsolve this gloom! Bind in eternal adamant the winds That drown or wither: Give the genial West To breathe, and in its turn the sprightly North: And may once more the circling seasons rule The year; not mix in every monstrous day. Mean time, the moist malignity to shun Of burthen'd skies; mark where the dry champaign Swells into chearful hills; where Marjoram And Thyme, the love of bees, perfume the air; And where the The wild rose, or that which grows on the common briar. Cynorrhodon with the rose For fragrance vies; for in the thirsty soil Most fragrant breathe the aromatic tribes. There bid thy roofs high on the basking steep Ascend, there light thy hospitable fires. And let them see the winter morn arise, The summer evening blushing in the west; While with umbrageous oaks the ridge behind O'erhung, defends you from the blust'ring north, And bleak affliction of the peevish east. O! when the growling winds contend, and all The sounding forest fluctuates in the storm; To sink in warm repose, and hear the din Howl o'er the steady battlements, delights Above the luxury of vulgar sleep. The murmuring rivulet, and the hoarser strain Of waters rushing o'er the slippery rocks, Will nightly lull you to ambrosial rest. To please the fancy is no trifling good, Where health is studied; for whatever moves The mind with calm delight, promotes the just And natural movements of th' harmonious frame. Besides, the sportive brook for ever shakes The trembling air; that floats from hill to hill, From vale to mountain, with incessant change Of purest element, refreshing still Your airy seat, and uninfected Gods. Chiefly for this I praise the man who builds High on the breezy ridge, whose lofty sides Th' etherial deep with endless billows chafes. His purer mansion nor contagious years Shall reach, nor deadly putrid airs annoy. But may no fogs, from lake or fenny plain, Involve my hill! And wheresoe'er you build; Whether on sun-burnt Epsom, or the plains Wash'd by the silent Lee; in Chelsea low, Or high Blackheath with wintry winds assail'd; Dry be your house: but airy more than warm. Else every breath of ruder wind will strike Your tender body thro' with rapid pains; Fierce coughs will teize you, hoarseness bind your voice, Or moist Gravedo load your aching brows. These to defy, and all the fates that dwell In cloister'd air tainted with steaming life, Let lofty ceilings grace your ample rooms; And still at azure noontide may your dome At every window drink the liquid sky. Need we the sunny situation here, And theatres open to the south, commend? Here, where the morning's misty breath infests More than the torrid noon? How sickly grow, How pale, the plants in those ill-fated vales That, circled round with the gigantic heap Of mountains, never felt, nor ever hope To feel, the genial vigour of the sun! While on the neighbouring hill the rose inflames The verdant spring; in virgin beauty blows The tender lily, languishingly sweet; O'er every hedge the wanton woodbine roves, And autumn ripens in the summer's ray. Nor less the warmer living tribes demand The fost'ring sun: whose energy divine Dwells not in mortal fire; whose gen'rous heat Glows thro' the mass of grosser elements, And kindles into life the ponderous spheres. Chear'd by thy kind invigorating warmth, We court thy beams, great majesty of day! If not the soul, the regent of this world, First-born of heaven, and only less than God! BOOK II. DIET. Enough of Air. A desart subject now, Rougher and wilder, rises to my sight. A barren waste, where not a garland grows To bind the Muse's brow; not ev'n a proud Stupendous solitude frowns o'er the heath, To rouse a noble horror in the soul: But rugged paths fatigue, and error leads Thro' endless labyrinths the devious feet. Farewel, etherial fields! the humbler arts Of life; the Table and the homely Gods Demand my song. Elysian gales adieu! The blood, the fountain whence the spirits flow, The generous stream that waters every part, And motion, vigour, and warm life conveys To every particle that moves or lives; This vital fluid, thro' unnumber'd tubes Pour'd by the heart, and to the heart again Refunded; scourg'd for ever round and round; Enrag'd with heat and toil, at last forgets Its balmy nature; virulent and thin It grows; and now, but that a thousand gates Are open to its flight, it would destroy The parts it cherish'd and repair'd before. Besides, the flexible and tender tubes Melt in the mildest most nectareous tide That ripening nature rolls; as in the stream Its crumbling banks; but what the vital force Of plastic fluids hourly batters down, That very force, those plastic particles Rebuild: So mutable the state of man. For this the watchful appetite was giv'n, Daily with fresh materials to repair This unavoidable expence of life, This necessary waste of flesh and blood. Hence the concoctive powers, with various art, Subdue the cruder aliments to chyle; The chyle to blood; the foamy purple tide To liquors, which thro' finer arteries To different parts their winding course pursue; To try new changes, and new forms put on, Or for the public, or some private use. Nothing so foreign but th' athletic hind Can labour into blood. The hungry meal Alone he fears, or aliments too thin; By violent powers too easily subdu'd, Too soon expell'd. His daily labour thaws, To friendly chyle, the most rebellious mass That salt can harden, or the smoke of years; Nor does his gorge the luscious bacon rue, Nor that which Cestria sends, tenacious paste Of solid milk. But ye of softer clay, Infirm and delicate! and ye who waste With pale and bloated sloth the tedious day! Avoid the stubborn aliment, avoid The full repast; and let sagacious age Grow wiser, lesson'd by the dropping teeth. Half subtiliz'd to chyle, the liquid food Readiest obeys th' assimilating powers; And soon the tender vegetable mass Relents; and soon the young of those that tread The stedfast earth, or cleave the green abyss, Or pathless sky. And if the Steer must fall, In youth and sanguine vigour let him die; Nor stay till rigid age, or heavy ails, Absolve him ill-requited from the yoke. Some with high forage, and luxuriant ease, Indulge the veteran Ox; but wiser thou, From the bald mountain or the barren downs, Expect the flocks by frugal nature fed; A race of purer blood, with exercise Resin'd and scanty fare: For, old or young, The stall'd are never healthy; nor the cramm'd. Not all the culinary arts can tame, To wholesome food, the abominable growth Of rest and gluttony; the prudent taste Rejects like bane such loathsome lusciousness. The languid stomach curses even the pure Delicious fat, and all the race of oil: For more the oily aliments relax Its feeble tone; and with the eager lymph (Fond to incorporate with all it meets) Coily they mix, and shun with slippery wiles The woo'd embrace. Th' irresoluble oil, So gentle late and blandishing, in floods Of rancid bile o'erflows: What tumults hence, What horrors rise, were nauseous to relate. Chuse leaner viands, ye whose jovial make Too fast the gummy nutriment imbibes: Chuse sober meals; and rouse to active life Your cumbrous clay; nor on th' infeebling down, Irresolute, protract the morning hours. But let the man whose bones are thinly clad, With chearful ease and succulent repast Improve his habit if he can; for each Extreme departs from perfect sanity. I could relate what table this demands Or that complexion; what the various powers Of various foods: But fifty years would roll, And fifty more before the tale were done. Besides there often lurks some nameless, strange, Peculiar thing; nor on the skin display'd, Felt in the pulse, nor in the habit seen; Which finds a poison in the food that most The temp'rature affects. There are, whose blood Impetuous rages thro' the turgid veins, Who better bear the fiery fruits of Ind Than the moist Melon, or pale Cucumber. Of chilly nature others fly the board Supply'd with slaughter, and the vernal powers For cooler, kinder, sustenance implore. Some even the generous nutriment detest Which, in the shell, the sleeping embryo rears. Some, more unhappy still, repent the gifts Of Pales; soft, delicious and benign: The balmy quintessence of every flower, And every grateful herb that decks the spring; The fost'ring dew of tender sprouting life; The best refection of declining age; The kind restorative of those who lie Half dead and panting, from the doubtful strife Of nature struggling in the grasp of death. Try all the bounties of this fertile globe, There is not such a salutary food As suits with every stomach. But (except, Amid the mingled mass of fish and fowl, And boil'd and bak'd, you hesitate by which You sunk oppress'd, or whether not by all;) Taught by experience soon you may discern What pleases, what offends. Avoid the cates That lull the sicken'd appetite too long; Or heave with fev'rish flushings all the face, Burn in the palms, and parch the roughning tongue; Or much diminish or too much increase Th' expence, which nature's wise Åconomy, Without or waste or avarice, maintains. Such cates abjur'd, let prouling hunger loose, And bid the curious palate roam at will; They scarce can err amid the various stores That burst the teeming entrails of the world. Led by sagacious taste, the ruthless king Of beasts on blood and slaughter only lives; The Tiger, form'd alike to cruel meals, Would at the manger starve: Of milder seeds The generous horse to herbage and to grain Confines his wish; tho' fabling Greece resound The Thracian steeds with human carnage wild. Prompted by instinct's never-erring power, Each creature knows its proper aliment; But man, th' inhabitant of ev'ry clime, With all the commoners of nature feeds. Directed, bounded, by this power within, Their cravings are well-aim'd: Voluptuous Man Is by superior faculties misled; Misled from pleasure even in quest of joy. Sated with nature's boons, what thousands seek, With dishes tortur'd from their native taste, And mad variety, to spur beyond Its wiser will the jaded appetite! Is this for pleasure? Learn a juster taste; And know that temperance is true luxury. Or is it pride? Pursue some nobler aim. Dismiss your parasites, who praise for hire; And earn the fair esteem of honest men, Whose praise is fame. Form'd of such clay as yours, The sick, the needy, shiver at your gates. Even modest want may bless your hand unseen, Tho' hush'd in patient wretchedness at home. Is there no virgin, grac'd with every charm But that which binds the mercenary vow? No youth of genius, whose neglected bloom Unfoster'd sickens in the barren shade; No worthy man, by fortune's random blows, Or by a heart too generous and humane, Constrain'd to leave his happy natal seat, And sigh for wants more bitter than his own? There are, while human miseries abound, A thousand ways to waste superfluous wealth, Without one fool or flatterer at your board, Without one hour of sickness or disgust. But other ills th' ambiguous feast pursue, Besides provoking the lascivious taste. Such various foods, th' harmless each alone, Each other violate; and oft we see What strife is brew'd, and what pernicious bane, From combinations of innoxious things. Th' unbounded taste I mean not to confine To hermit's diet needlesly severe. But would you long the sweets of health enjoy, Or husband pleasure; at one impious meal Exhaust not half the bounties of the year, Of every realm. It matters not mean while How much to-morrow differ from to-day; So far indulge: 'tis fit, besides, that man, To change obnoxious, be to change innur'd. But stay the curious appetite, and taste With caution fruits you never tried before. For want of use the kindest aliment Sometimes offends; while custom tames the rage Of poison to mild amity with life. So heav'n has form'd us to the general taste Of all its gifts; so custom has improv'd This bent of nature; that few simple foods, Of all that earth, or air, or ocean yield, But by excess offend. Beyond the sense Of light refection, at the genial board Indulge not often; nor protract the feast To dull satiety; till soft and slow A drowzy death creeps on, th' expansive soul Oppress'd, and smother'd the celestial fire. The stomach, urg'd beyond its active tone, Hardly to nutrimental chyle subdues The softest food: unfinish'd and deprav'd, The chyle, in all its future wanderings, owns Its turbid fountain; not by purer streams So to be clear'd, but foulness will remain. To sparkling wine what ferment can exalt Th' unripen'd grape? Or what mechanic skill From the crude ore can spin the ductile gold? Gross riot treasures up a wealthy fund Of plagues: but more immedicable ills Attend the lean extreme. For physic knows How to disburden the too tumid veins, Even how to ripen the half-labour'd blood: But to unlock the elemental tubes, Collaps'd and shrunk with long inanity, And with balsamic nutriment repair The dried and worn-out habit, were to bid Old age grow green, and wear a second spring; Or the tall ash, long ravish'd from the soil, Thro' wither'd veins imbibe the vernal dew. When hunger calls, obey; nor often wait Till hunger sharpen to corrosive pain: For the keen appetite will feast beyond What nature well can bear; and one extreme Ne'er without danger meets its own reverse. Too greedily th' exhausted veins absorb The recent chyle, and load enfeebled powers Oft to th' extinction of the vital flame. To the pale cities, by the firm-set siege And famine humbled, may this verse be borne; And hear, ye hardiest sons that Albion breeds Long toss'd and famish'd on the wintry main; The war shook off, or hospitable shore Attain'd, with temperance bear the shock of joy; Nor crown with festive rites th' auspicious day: Such feast might prove more fatal than the waves, Than war or famine. While the vital fire Burns feebly, heap not the green fuel on; But prudently foment the wandering spark With what the soonest feeds its kindred touch: Be frugal ev'n of that: a little give At first; that kindled, add a little more; Till, by deliberate nourishing, the flame Reviv'd, with all its wonted vigour glows. But tho' the two (the full and the jejune) Extremes have each their vice; it much avails Ever with gentle tide to ebb and flow From this to that: So nature learns to bear Whatever chance or headlong appetite May bring. Besides, a meagre day subdues The cruder clods by sloth or luxury Collected, and unloads the wheels of life. Sometimes a coy aversion to the feast Comes on, while yet no blacker omen lours; Then is a time to shun the tempting board, Were it your natal or your nuptial day. Perhaps a fast so seasonable starves The latent seeds of woe, which rooted once Might cost you labour. But the day return'd Of festal luxury, the wise indulge Most in the tender vegetable breed: Then chiefly when the summer beams inflame The brazen heavens; or angry Sirius sheds A feverish taint thro' the still gulph of air. The moist cool viands then, and flowing cup From the fresh dairy-virgin's liberal hand, Will save your head from harm, tho' round the world The dreaded The burning fever. Causos roll his wasteful fires. Pale humid winter loves the generous board, The meal more copious, and a warmer fare; And longs with old wood and old wine to chear His quaking heart. The seasons which divide Th' empires of heat and cold; by neither claim'd, Influenc'd by both; a middle regimen Impose. Thro' autumn's languishing domain Descending, nature by degrees invites To glowing luxury. But from the depth Of winter when th' invigorated year Emerges; when Favonius flush'd with love, Toyful and young, in every breeze descends More warm and wanton on his kindling bride; Then, shepherds, then begin to spare your flocks; And learn, with wise humanity, to check The lust of blood. Now pregnant earth commits A various offspring to th' indulgent sky: Now bounteous nature feeds with lavish hand The prone creation; yields what once suffic'd Their dainty sovereign, when the world was young; Ere yet the barbarous thirst of blood had seiz'd The human breast.âEach rolling month matures The food that suits it most; so does each clime. Far in the horrid realms of Winter, where Th' establish'd ocean heaps a monstrous waste Of shining rocks and mountains to the pole: There lives a hardy race, whose plainest wants Relentless earth, their cruel step-mother, Regards not. On the waste of iron fields, Untam'd, intractable, no harvests wave: Pomona hates them, and the clownish God Who tends the garden. In this frozen world Such cooling gifts were vain: a fitter meal Is earn'd with ease; for here the fruitful spawn Of Ocean swarms, and heaps their genial board With generous fare and luxury profuse. These are their bread, the only bread they know; These, and their willing slave the deer that crops The shrubby herbage on their meagre hills. Girt by the burning Zone, not thus the South Her swarthy sons in either Ind, maintains: Or thirsty Libya; from whose fervid loins The lion bursts, and every fiend that roams Th' affrighted wilderness. The mountain herd, Adust and dry, no sweet repast affords; Nor does the tepid main such kinds produce, So perfect, so delicious, as the shoals Of icy Zembla. Rashly where the blood Brews feverish frays; where scarce the tubes sustain Its tumid fervour and tempestuous course; Kind nature tempts not to such gifts as these. But here in livid ripeness melts the Grape: Here, finish'd by invigorating suns, Thro' the green shade the golden Orange glows: Spontaneous here the turgid Melon yields A generous pulp: the Coco swells on high With milky riches; and in horrid mail The crisp Ananas wraps its poignant sweets. Earth's vaunted progeny: In ruder air Too coy to flourish, even too proud to live; Or hardly rais'd by artificial fire To vapid life. Here with a mother's smile Glad Amalthea pours her copious horn. Here buxom Ceres reigns: Th' autumnal sea In boundless billows fluctuates o'er their plains. What suits the climate best, what suits the men, Nature profuses most, and most the taste Demands. The fountain, edg'd with racy wine Or acid fruit, bedews their thirsty souls. The breeze eternal breathing round their limbs Supports in else intolerable air: While the cool Palm, the Plaintain, and the grove That waves on gloomy Lebanon, assuage The torrid hell that beams upon their heads. Now come, ye Naiads, to the fountains lead; Now let me wander thro' your gelid reign. I burn to view th' enthusiastic wilds By mortal else untrod. I hear the din Of waters thund'ring o'er the ruin'd cliffs. With holy reverence I approach the rocks Whence glide the streams renown'd in ancient song. Here from the desart down the rumbling steep First springs the Nile; here bursts the sounding Po In angry waves; Euphrates hence devolves A mighty flood to water half the East; And there, in Gothic solitude reclin'd, The chearless Tanais pours his hoary urn. What solemn twilight! What stupendous shades Enwrap these infant floods! Thro' every nerve A sacred horror thrills, a pleasing fear Glides o'er my frame. The forest deepens round; And more gigantic still th' impending trees Stretch their extravagant arms athwart the gloom. Are these the confines of some fairy world? A land of Genii? Say, beyond these wilds What unknown nations? If indeed beyond Aught habitable lies. And whither leads, To what strange regions, or of bliss or pain, That subterraneous way? Propitious maids, Conduct me, while with fearful steps I tread This trembling ground. The task remains to sing Your gifts (so PÃ¦on, so the powers of health Command) to praise your crystal element: The chief ingredient in heaven's various works; Whose flexile genius sparkles in the gem, Grows firm in oak, and fugitive in wine; The vehicle, the source, of nutriment And life, to all that vegetate or live. O comfortable streams! With eager lips And trembling hand the languid thirsty quaff New life in you; fresh vigour fills their veins. No warmer cups the rural ages knew; None warmer sought the sires of human kind. Happy in temperate peace! Their equal days Felt not th' alternate fits of feverish mirth, And sick dejection. Still serene and pleas'd They knew no pains but what the tender soul With pleasure yields to, and would ne'er forget. Blest with divine immunity from ails, Long centuries they liv'd; their only fate Was ripe old age, and rather sleep than death. Oh! could those worthies from the world of Gods Return to visit their degenerate sons, How would they scorn the joys of modern time, With all our art and toil improv'd to pain! Too happy they! But wealth brought luxury, And luxury on sloth begot disease. Learn temperance, friends; and hear without disdain The choice of water. Thus the Hippocrates. Coan sage Opin'd, and thus the learn'd of every School. What least of foreign principles partakes Is best: The lightest then; what bears the touch Of fire the least, and soonest mounts in air; The most insipid; the most void of smell. Such the rude mountain from his horrid sides Pours down; such waters in the sandy vale For ever boil, alike of winter frosts And summer's heat secure. The crystal stream, Through rocks resounding, or for many a mile O'er the chaf'd pebbles hurl'd, yields wholesome, pure And mellow draughts; except when winter thaws, And half the mountains melt into the tide. Tho' thirst were e'er so resolute, avoid The sordid lake, and all such drowsy floods As fill from Lethe Belgia's slow canals; (With rest corrupt, with vegetation green; Squalid with generation, and the birth Of little monsters;) till the power of fire Has from prophane embraces disengag'd The violated lymph. The virgin stream In boiling wastes its finer soul in air. Nothing like simple element dilutes The food, or gives the chyle so soon to flow. But where the ftomach indolent and cold Toys with its duty, animate with wine Th' insipid stream: Tho' golden Ceres yields A more voluptuous, a more sprightly draught; Perhaps more active. Wine unmix'd, and all The gluey floods that from the vex'd abyss Of fermentation spring; with spirit fraught, And furious with intoxicating fire; Retard concoction, and preserve unthaw'd Th' embodied mass. You see what countless years, Embalm'd in siery quintescence of wine, The puny wonders of the reptile world, The tender rudiments of life, the slim Unravellings of minute anatomy, Maintain their texture, and unchang'd remain. We curse not wine: The vile excess we blame; More fruitful than th' accumulated board, Of pain and misery. For the subtle draught Faster and surer swells the vital tide; And with more active poison, than the floods Of grosser crudity convey, pervades The far remote meanders of our frame. Ah! sly deceiver! Branded o'er and o'er, Yet still believ'd! Exulting o'er the wreck Of sober vows!âBut the Parnassian Maids See Book iv. Another time perhaps shall sing the joys, The fatal charms, the many woes of wine; Perhaps its various tribes, and various powers. Mean time, I would not always dread the bowl, Nor every trespass shun. The feverish strife, Rous'd by the rare debauch, subdues, expells The loitering crudities that burden life; And, like a torrent full and rapid, clears Th' obstructed tubes. Besides, this restless world Is full of chances, which by habit's power To learn to bear is easier than to shun. Ah! when ambition, meagre love of gold, Or sacred country calls, with mellowing wine To moisten well the thirsty suffrages; Say how, unseason'd to the midnight frays Of Comus and his rout, wilt thou contend With Centaurs long to hardy deeds inur'd? Then learn to revel; but by slow degrees: By slow degrees the liberal arts are won; And Hercules grew strong. But when you smooth The brows of care, indulge your festive vein In cups by well-inform'd experience found The least your bane: and only with your friends. There are sweet follies; frailties to be seen By friends alone, and men of generous minds. Oh! seldom may the fated hours return Of drinking deep! I would not daily taste, Except when life declines, even sober cups. Weak withering age no rigid law forbids, With frugal nectar, smooth and slow with balm, The sapless habit daily to bedew, And give the hesitating wheels of life Gliblier to play. But youth has better joys: And is it wise when youth with pleasure flows, To squander the reliefs of age and pain! What dextrous thousands just within the goal Of wild debauch direct their nightly course! Perhaps no sickly qualms bedim their days, No morning admonitions shock the head. But ah! what woes remain! Life rolls apace, And that incurable disease old age, In youthful bodies more severely felt, More sternly active, shakes their blasted prime: Except kind nature by some hasty blow Prevent the lingering fates. For know, whate'er Beyond its natural fervour hurries on The sanguine tide; whether the frequent bowl, High-season'd fare, or exercise to toil Protracted; spurs to its last stage tir'd life, And sows the temples with untimely snow. When life is new, the ductile fibres feel The heart's increasing force; and, day by day, The growth advances: till the larger tubes, Acquiring (from their In the human body, as well as in those of other animals, the larger blood vessels are composed of smaller ones; which, by the violent motion and pressure of the fluids in the large vessels, lose their cavities by degrees, and degenerate into impervious chords or fibres. In proportion as these small vessels become solid, the larger must of course grow less extensile, more rigid, and make a stronger resistance to the action of the heart, and force of the blood. From this gradual condensation of the smaller vessels, and consequent rigidity of the larger ones, the progress of the human body from infancy to old age is accounted for. elemental veins, Condens'd to solid chords) a firmer tone, Sustain, and just sustain, th' impetuous blood. Here stops the growth. With overbearing pulse And pressure, still the great destroy the small; Still with the ruins of the small grow strong. Life glows mean time, amid the grinding force Of viscuous fluids and elastic tubes; Its various functions vigorously are plied By strong machinery; and in solid health The Man confirm'd long triumphs o'er disease. But the full ocean ebbs: There is a point, By nature fix'd, whence life must downward tend. For still the beating tide consolidates The stubborn vessels, more reluctant still To the weak throbs of th' ill-supported heart. This languishing, these strength'ning by degrees To hard unyielding unelastic bone, Thro' tedious channels the congealing flood Crawls lazily, and hardly wanders on; It loiters still: And now it stirs no more. This is the period few attain; the death Of nature; thus (so heav'n ordain'd it) life Destroys itself; and could these laws have chang'd, Nestor might now the fates of Troy relate; And Homer live immortal as his song. What does not fade? The tower that long had stood The crush of thunder and the warring winds, Shook by the slow but sure destroyer Time, Now hangs in doubtful ruins o'er its base. And flinty pyramids, and walls of brass, Descend: the Babylonian spires are sunk; Achaia, Rome, and Egypt moulder down. Time shakes the stable tyranny of thrones, And tottering empires rush by their own weight. This huge rotundity we tread grows old; And all those worlds that roll around the sun, The sun himself, shall die; and ancient Night Again involve the desolate abyss: Till the great Father thro' the lifeless gloom Extend his arm to light another world, And bid new planets roll by other laws. For thro' the regions of unbounded space, Where unconfin'd Omnipotence has room, Being, in various systems, fluctuates still Between creation and abhorr'd decay: It ever did; perhaps and ever will. New worlds are still emerging from the deep; The old descending, in their turns to rise. BOOK III. EXERCISE. Thro' various toils th' adventurous Muse has past; But half the toil, and more than half, remains. Rude is her Theme, and hardly fit for Song; Plain, and of little ornament; and I But little practis'd in th' Aonian arts. Yet not in vain such labours have we tried, If aught these lays the fickle health confirm. To you, ye delicate, I write; for you I tame my youth to philosophic cares, And grow still paler by the midnight lamps. Not to debilitate with timorous rules A hardy frame; nor needlesly to brave Unglorious dangers, proud of mortal strength; Is all the lesson that in wholesome years Concerns the strong. His care were ill bestow'd Who would with warm effeminacy nurse The thriving oak which on the mountain's brow Bears all the blasts that sweep the wintry heav'n. Behold the labourer of the glebe, who toils In dust, in rain, in cold and sultry skies; Save but the grain from mildews and the flood, Nought anxious he what sickly stars ascend. He knows no laws by Esculapius given; He studies none. Yet him nor midnight fogs Infest, nor those envenom'd shafts that fly When rabid Sirius fires th' autumnal noon. His habit pure with plain and temperate meals, Robust with labour, and by custom steel'd To every casualty of varied life; Serene he bears the peevish Eastern blast, And uninfected breathes the mortal South. Such the reward of rude and sober life; Of labour such. By health the peasant's toil Is well repaid; if exercise were pain Indeed, and temperance pain. By arts like these Laconia nurs'd of old her hardy sons; And Rome's unconquer'd legions urg'd their way, Unhurt, thro' every toil in every clime. Toil, and be strong. By toil the flaccid nerves Grow firm, and gain a more compacted tone; The greener juices are by toil subdu'd, Mellow'd, and subtiliz'd; the vapid old Expell'd, and all the rancour of the blood. Come, my companions, ye who feel the charms Of nature and the year; come, let us stray Where chance or fancy leads our roving walk: Come, while the soft voluptuous breezes fan The fleecy heavens, enwrap the limbs in balm, And shed a charming languor o'er the soul. Nor when bright Winter sows with prickly frost The vigorous ether, in unmanly warmth Indulge at home; nor even when Eurus' blasts This way and that convolve the lab'ring woods. My liberal walks, save when the skies in rain Or fogs relent, no season should confine Or to the cloister'd gallery or arcade. Go, climb the mountain; from th' ethereal source Imbibe the recent gale. The chearful morn Beams o'er the hills; go, mount th' exulting steed. Already, see, the deep-mouth'd beagles catch The tainted mazes; and, on eager sport Intent, with emulous impatience try Each doubtful trace. Or, if a nobler prey Delight you more, go chase the desperate deer; And thro' its deepest solitudes awake The vocal forest with the jovial horn. But if the breathless chase o'er hill and dale Exceed your strength; a sport of less fatigue, Not less delightful, the prolific stream Affords. The crystal rivulet, that o'er A stony channel rolls its rapid maze, Swarms with the silver fry. Such, thro' the bounds Of pastoral Stafford, runs the brawling Trent; Such Eden, sprung from Cumbrian mountains; such The Esk, o'erhung with woods; and such the stream On whose Arcadian banks I first drew air, Liddal; till now, except in Doric lays Tun'd to her murmurs by her love-sick swains, Unknown in song: Tho' not a purer stream, Thro' meads more flowery or more romantic groves, Rolls toward the western main. Hail, sacred flood! May still thy hospitable swains be blest In rural innocence; thy mountains still Teem with the fleecy race; thy tuneful woods For ever flourish; and thy vales look gay With painted meadows, and the golden grain! Oft, with thy blooming sons, when life was new, Sportive and petulant, and charm'd with toys, In thy transparent eddies have I lav'd: Oft trac'd with patient steps thy fairy banks, With the well-imitated fly to hook The eager trout, and with the slender line And yielding rod sollicite to the shore The struggling panting prey; while vernal clouds And tepid gales obscur'd the ruffled pool, And from the deeps call'd forth the wanton swarms. Form'd on the Samian school, or those of Ind, There are who think these pastimes scarce humane. Yet in my mind (and not relentless I) His life is pure that wears no fouler stains. But if thro' genuine tenderness of heart, Or secret want of relish for the game, You shun the glories of the chace, nor care To haunt the peopled stream; the Garden yields A soft amusement, an humane delight. To raise th' insipid nature of the ground; Or tame its savage genius to the grace Of careless sweet rusticity, that seems The amiable result of happy chance, Is to create; and gives a god-like joy, Which every year improves. Nor thou disdain To check the lawless riot of the trees, To plant the grove, or turn the barren mould. O happy he! whom, when his years decline, (His fortune and his fame by worthy means Attain'd, and equal to his moderate mind; His life approv'd by all the wise and good, Even envied by the vain) the peaceful groves Of Epicurus, from this stormy world, Receive to rest; of all ungrateful cares Absolv'd, and sacred from the selfish crowd. Happiest of men! if the same soil invites A chosen few, companions of his youth, Once fellow-rakes perhaps, now rural friends; With whom in easy commerce to pursue Nature's free charms, and vie for sylvan fame: A fair ambition; void of strife or guile, Or jealousy, or pain to be outdone. Who plans th' enchanted garden, who directs The visto best, and best conducts the stream; Whose groves the fastest thicken and ascend; Whom first the welcome spring salutes; who shews The earliest bloom, the sweetest proudest charms Of Flora; who best gives Pomona's juice To match the sprightly genius of champain. Thrice happy days! in rural business past: Blest winter nights! when as the genial fire Chears the wide hall, his cordial family With soft domestic arts the hours beguile, And pleasing talk that starts no timorous fame, With witless wantonness to hunt it down: Or thro' the fairy-land of tale or song Delighted wander, in fictitious fates Engag'd, and all that strikes humanity: Till lost in fable, they the stealing hour Of timely rest forget. Sometimes, at eve His neighbours lift the latch, and bless unbid His festal roof; while, o'er the light repast, And sprightly cups, they mix in social joy; And, thro' the maze of conversation, trace Whate'er amuses or improves the mind. Sometimes at eve (for I delight to taste The native zest and flavour of the fruit, Where sense grows wild and takes of no manure) The decent, honest, chearful husbandman Should drown his labours in my friendly bowl; And at my table find himself at home. Whate'er you study, in whate'er you sweat, Indulge your taste. Some love the manly foils; The tennis some; and some the graceful dance. Others more hardy, range the purple heath, Or naked stubble; where from field to field The sounding coveys urge their labouring flight; Eager amid the rising cloud to pour The gun's unerring thunder: And there are Whom still the This word is much used by some of the old English poets, and signifies Reward or Prize. meed of the green archer charms. He chuses best, whose labour entertains His vacant fancy most: The toil you hate Fatigues you soon, and scarce improves your limbs. As beauty still has blemish; and the mind The most accomplish'd its imperfect side; Few bodies are there of that happy mould But some one part is weaker than the rest: The legs, perhaps, or arms refufe their load, Or the chest labours. These assiduously, But gently, in their proper arts employ'd, Acquire a vigour and springy activity To which they were not born. But weaker parts Abhor fatigue and violent discipline. Begin with gentle toils; and, as your nerves Grow firm, to hardier by just steps aspire. The prudent, even in every moderate walk, At first but saunter; and by slow degrees Increase their pace. This doctrine of the wise Well knows the master of the flying steed. First from the goal the manag'd coursers play On bended reins: as yet the skilful youth Repress their foamy pride; but every breath The race grows warmer, and the tempest swells; Till all the fiery mettle has its way, And the thick thunder hurries o'er the plain. When all at once from indolence to toil You spring, the fibres by the hasty shock Are tir'd and crack'd, before their unctuous coats, Compress'd, can pour the lubricating balm. Besides, collected in the passive veins, The purple mass a sudden torrent rolls, O'erpowers the heart and deluges the lungs With dangerous inundation: Oft the source Of fatal woes; a cough that foams with blood, Asthma and feller The inflammation of the lungs. Peripneumony, Or the slow minings of the hectic fire. Th' athletic Fool, to whom what heav'n deny'd Of soul is well compensated in limbs, Oft from his rage, or brainless frolic, feels His vegetation and brute force decay. The men of better clay and finer mould Know nature, feel the human dignity; And scorn to vie with oxen or with apes. Pursu'd prolixly, even the gentlest toil Is waste of health: repose by small fatigue Is earn'd; and (where your habit is not prone To thaw) by the first moisture of the brows. The fine and subtle spirits cost too much To be profus'd, too much the roscid balm. But when the hard varieties of life You toil to learn; or try the dusty chace, Or the warm deeds of some important day: Hot from the field, indulge not yet your limbs In wish'd repose; nor court the fanning gale, Nor taste the spring. O! by the sacred tears Of widows, orphans, mothers, sisters, sires, Forbear! No other pestilence has driven Such myriads o'er th' irremeable deep. Why this so fatal, the sagacious Muse Thro' nature's cunning labyrinths could trace: But there are secrets which who knows not now, Must, ere he reach them, climb the heapy Alps Of Science; and devote seven years to toil. Besides, I would not stun your patient ears With what it little boots you to attain. He knows enough, the mariner, who knows Where lurk the shelves, and where the whirlpools boil, What signs portend the storm: To subtler minds He leaves to scan, from what mysterious cause Charybdis rages in th' Ionian wave; Whence those impetuous currents in the main Which neither oar nor sail can stem; and why The roughening deep expects the storm, as sure As red Orion mounts the shrouded heaven. In ancient times, when Rome with Athens vied For polish'd luxury and useful arts; All hot and reeking from th' Olympic strife, And warm Palestra, in the tepid bath Th' athletic youth relax'd their weary limbs. Soft oils bedew'd them, with the grateful pow'rs Of Nard and Cassia fraught, to sooth and heal The cherish'd nerves. Our less voluptuous clime Not much invites us to such arts as these. 'Tis not for those, whom gelid skies embrace, And chilling fogs; whose perspiration feels Such frequent bars from Eurus and the North; 'Tis not for those to cultivate a skin Too soft; or teach the recremental fume Too fast to crowd thro' such precarious ways. For thro' the small arterial mouths, that pierce In endless millions the close-woven skin, The baser fluids in a constant stream Escape, and viewless melt into the winds. While this eternal, this most copious, waste Of blood, degenerate into vapid brine, Maintains its wonted measure, all the powers Of health befriend you, all the wheels of life With ease and pleasure move: But this restrain'd Or more or less, so more or less you feel The functions labour: From this fatal source What woes descend is never to be sung. To take their numbers were to count the sands That ride in whirlwind the parch'd Libyan air; Or waves that, when the blustering North embroils The Baltic, thunder on the German shore. Subject not then, by soft emollient arts, This grand expence, on which your fates depend, To every caprice of the sky; nor thwart The genius of your clime: For from the blood Least fickle rise the recremental steams, And least obnoxious to the styptic air, Which breathe thro' straiter and more callous pores, The temper'd Scythian hence, half-naked treads His boundless snows, nor rues th' inclement heaven; And hence our painted ancestors defied The East: nor curs'd, like us, their fickle sky. The body, moulded by the clime, endures Th' Equator heats or Hyperborean frost: Except by habits foreign to its turn, Unwise you counteract its forming pow'r. Rude at the first, the winter shocks you less By long acquaintance: Study then your sky, Form to its manners your obsequious frame, And learn to suffer what you cannot shun. Against the rigors of a damp cold heav'n To fortify their bodies, some frequent The gelid cistern; and, where nought forbids, I praise their dauntless heart: A frame so steel'd Dreads not the cough, nor those ungenial blasts That breathe the Tertian or fell Rheumatism; The nerves so temper'd never quit their tone, No chronic languors haunt such hardy breasts. But all things have their bounds: and he who makes By daily use the kindest regimen Essential to his health, should never mix With human kind, nor art nor trade pursue. He not the safe vicissitudes of life Without some shock endures; ill-fitted he To want the known, or bear unusual things, Besides, the powerful remedies of pain (Since pain in spite of all our care will come) Should never with your prosperous days of health Grow too familiar: For by frequent use The strongest medicines lose their healing power, And even the surest poisons theirs to kill. Let those who from the frozen Arctos reach Parch'd Mauritania, or the sultry West, Or the wide flood that laves rich Indostan, Plunge thrice a day, and in the tepid wave Untwist their stubborn pores; that full and free Th' evaporation thro' the soften'd skin May bear proportion to the swelling blood. So may they 'scape the fever's rapid flames; So feel untainted the hot breath of hell. With us, the man of no complaint demands The warm ablution just enough to clear The sluices of the skin, enough to keep The body sacred from indecent soil. Still to be pure, ev'n did it not conduce (As much it does) to health, were greatly worth Your daily pains. 'Tis this adorns the rich; The want of this is poverty's worst woe; With this external virtue Age maintains A decent grace; without it youth and charms Are loathsome. This the venal Graces know; So doubtless do your wives: For married sires, As well as lovers, still pretend to taste; Nor is it less (all prudent wives can tell) To lose a husband's than a lover's heart. But now the hours and seasons when to toil From foreign themes recall my wandering song. Some labour fasting, or but slightly fed To lull the grinding stomach's hungry rage. Where nature feeds too corpulent a frame 'Tis wisely done: For while the thirsty veins, Impatient of lean penury, devour The treasur'd oil, then is the happiest time To shake the lazy balsam from its cells. Now while the stomach from the full repast Subsides, but ere returning hunger gnaws, Ye leaner habits, give an hour to toil: And ye whom no luxuriancy of growth Oppresses yet, or threatens to oppress. But from the recent meal no labours please, Of limbs or mind. For now the cordial powers Claim all the wandering spirits to a work Of strong and subtle toil, and great event: A work of time: and you may rue the day You hurried, with untimely exercise, A half-concocted chyle into the blood. The body overcharg'd with unctuous phlegm Much toil demands: The lean elastic less. While winter chills the blood and binds the veins, No labours are too hard: By those you 'scape The slow diseases of the torpid year; Endless to name; to one of which alone, To that which tears the nerves, the toil of slaves Is pleasure: Oh! from such inhuman pains May all be free who merit not the wheel! But from the burning Lion when the sun Pours down his sultry wrath; now while the blood Too much already maddens in the veins, And all the finer fluids thro' the skin Explore their flight; me, near the cool cascade Reclin'd, or sauntring in the lofty grove, No needless slight occasion should engage To pant and sweat beneath the fiery noon. Now the fresh morn alone and mellow eve To shady walks and active rural sports Invite. But, while the chilling dews descend, May nothing tempt you to the cold embrace Of humid skies; tho' 'tis no vulgar joy To trace the horrors of the solemn wood While the soft evening saddens into night: Tho' the sweet Poet of the vernal groves Melts all the night in strains of am'rous woe. The shades descend, and midnight o'er the world Expands her sable wings. Great Nature droops Thro' all her works. Now happy he whose toil Has o'er his languid powerless limbs diffus'd A pleasing lassitude: He not in vain Invokes the gentle Deity of dreams. His powers the most voluptuously dissolve In soft repose: On him the balmy dews Of sleep with double nutriment descend. But would you sweetly waste the blank of night In deep oblivion; or on Fancy's wings Visit the paradise of happy Dreams, And waken chearful as the lively morn; Oppress not Nature sinking down to rest With feasts too late, too solid, or too full: But be the first concoction half-matur'd Ere you to mighty indolence resign Your passive faculties. He from the toils And troubles of the day to heavier toil Retires, whom trembling from the tower that rocks Amid the clouds, or Calpe's hideous height, The busy dÃ¦mons hurl; or in the main O'erwhelm; or bury struggling under ground. Not all a monarch's luxury the woes Can counterpoise of that most wretched man, Whose nights are shaken with the frantic fits Of wild Orestes; whose delirious brain, Stung by the Furies, works with poison'd thought: While pale and monstrous painting shocks the soul; And mangled consciousness bemoans itself For ever torn; and chaos floating round. What dreams presage, what dangers these or those Portend to sanity, tho' prudent seers Reveal'd of old and men of deathless fame, We would not to the superstitious mind Suggest new throbs, new vanities of fear. 'Tis ours to teach you from the peaceful night To banish omens and all restless woes. In study some protract the silent hours, Which others consecrate to mirth and wine; And sleep till noon, and hardly live till night. But surely this redeems not from the shades One hour of life. Nor does it nought avail What season you to drowsy Morpheus give Of th' ever-varying circle of the day; Or whether, thro' the tedious winter gloom, You tempt the midnight or the morning damps. The body, fresh and vigorous from repose, Defies the early fogs: but, by the toils Of wakeful day, exhausted and unstrung, Weakly resists the night's unwholesome breath. The grand discharge, th' effusion of the skin, Slowly impair'd, the languid maladies Creep on, and thro' the sickning functions steal. As, when the chilling East invades the spring, The delicate Narcissus pines away In hectic languor; and a slow disease Taints all the family of flowers, condemn'd To cruel heav'ns. But why, already prone To fade, should beauty cherish its own bane? O shame! O pity! nipt with pale Quadrille, And midnight cares, the bloom of Albion dies! By toil subdu'd, the Warrior and the Hind Sleep fast and deep: their active functions soon With generous streams the subtle tubes supply; And soon the tonic irritable nerves Feel the fresh impulse and awake the soul. The sons of indolence with long repose, Grow torpid; and with slowest Lethe drunk, Feebly and lingringly return to life, Blunt every sense and pow'rless every limb. Ye, prone to sleep (whom sleeping most annoys) On the hard matrass or elastic couch Extend your limbs, and wean yourselves from sloth; Nor grudge the lean projector, of dry brain And springy nerves, the blandishments of down: Nor envy while the buried Bacchanal Exhales his surfeit in prolixer dreams. He without riot, in the balmy feast Of life, the wants of nature has supply'd Who rises, cool, serene, and full of soul. But pliant nature more or less demands, As custom forms her; and all sudden change She hates of habit, even from bad to good. If faults in life, or new emergencies, From habits urge you by long time confirm'd, Slow may the change arrive, and stage by stage; Slow as the shadow o'er the dial moves, Slow as the stealing progress of the year. Observe the circling year. How unperceiv'd Her seasons change! Behold! by slow degrees, Stern Winter tam'd into a ruder Spring; The ripen'd Spring a milder Summer glows; Departing Summer sheds Pomona's store; And aged Autumn brews the winter-storm. Slow as they come, these changes come not void Of mortal shocks: The cold and torrid reigns, The two great periods of th' important year, Are in their first approaches seldom safe: Funereal Autumn all the sickly dread, And the black fates deform the lovely Spring. He well advis'd who taught our wiser sires Early to borrow Muscovy's warm spoils, Ere the first frost has touch'd the tender blade; And late resign them, tho' the wanton Spring Should deck her charms with all her sister's rays. For while the effluence of the skin maintains Its native measure, the pleuritic Spring Glides harmless by; and Autumn, sick to death With sallow Quartans, no contagion breathes. I in prophetic numbers could unfold The omens of the year: what seasons teem With what diseases; what the humid South Prepares, and what the Demon of the East: But you perhaps refuse the tedious song. Besides, whatever plagues in heat, or cold, Or drought, or moisture dwell, they hurt not you. Skill'd to correct the vices of the sky, And taught already how to each extream To bend your life. but should the public bane Infect you; or some trespass of your own, Or flaw of nature, hint mortality: Soon as a not unpleasing horror glides Along the spine, thro' all your torpid limbs; When first the head throbs, or the stomach feels A sickly load, a weary pain the loins; Be Celsus call'd: The Fates come rushing on; The rapid Fates admit of no delay. While wilful you, and fatally secure, Expect to-morrow's more auspicious sun, The growing pest, whose infancy was weak And easy vanquish'd, with triumphant sway O'erpow'rs your life. For want of timely care, Millions have died of medicable wounds. Ah! in what perils is vain life engag'd! What slight neglects, what trivial faults destroy The hardiest frame! of indolence, of toil, We die; of want, of superfluity: The all-surrounding heaven, the vital air, Is big with death. And, tho' the putrid South Be shut; tho' no convulsive agony Shake, from the deep foundations of the world, Th' imprisoned plagues; a secret venom oft Corrupts the air, the water, and the land. What livid deaths has sad Byzantium seen! How oft has Cairo, with a mother's woe, Wept o'er her slaughter'd sons and lonely streets! Even Albion, girt with less malignant skies, Albion the poison of the Gods has drank, And felt the sting of monsters all her own. Ere yet the fell Plantagenets had spent Their ancient rage, at Bosworth's purple field; While, for which tyrant England should receive, Her legions in incestuous murders mix'd, And daily horrors; till the Fates were drunk With kindred blood by kindred hands profus'd: Another plague of more gigantic arm Arose, a monster never known before, Rear'd from Cocytus its portentous head. This rapid Fury not, like other pests, Pursu'd a gradual course, but in a day Rush'd as a storm o'er half th' astonish'd isle, And strew'd with sudden carcases the land. First thro' the shoulders, or whatever part Was seiz'd the first, a fervid vapour sprung. With rash combustion thence, the quivering spark Shot to the heart, and kindled all within; And soon the surface caught the spreading fires. Thro' all the yielding pores, the melted blood Gush'd out in smoaky sweats; but nought assuag'd The torrid heat within, nor aught reliev'd The stomach's anguish. With incessant toil, Desperate of ease, impatient of their pain, They toss'd from side to side. In vain the stream Ran full and clear, they burnt and thirsted still. The restless arteries with rapid blood Beat strong and frequent. Thick and pantingly The breath was fetch'd, and with huge lab'rings heav'd. At last a heavy pain oppress'd the head, A wild delirium came; their weeping friends Were strangers now, and this no home of theirs. Harrass'd with toil on toil, the sinking powers Lay prostrate and o'erthrown; a ponderous sleep Wrapt all the senses up: they slept and died. In some a gentle horror crept at first O'er all the limbs; the sluices of the skin Withheld their moisture, till by art provok'd The sweats o'erflow'd; but in a clammy tide: Now free and copious, now restrain'd and slow; Of tinctures various, as the temperature Had mix'd the blood; and rank with fetid steams: As if the pent-up humours by delay Were grown more fell, more putrid, and malign. Here lay their hopes (tho' little hope remain'd) With full effusion of perpetual sweats To drive the venom out. And here the fates Were kind, that long they linger'd not in pain. For who surviv'd the sun's diurnal race Rose from the dreary gates of hell redeem'd: Some the sixth hour oppress'd, and some the third. Of many thousands few untainted 'scap'd; Of those infected fewer 'scap'd alive; Of those who liv'd some felt a second blow; And whom the second spar'd a third destroy'd. Frantic with fear, they sought by flight to shun The fierce contagion. O'er the mournful land Th' infected city pour'd her hurrying swarms: Rous'd by the flames that fir'd her seats around, Th' infected country rush'd into the town. Some, sad at home, and in the desart some, Abjur'd the fatal commerce of mankind; In vain: where'er they fled, the Fates pursu'd. Others, with hopes more specious, cross'd the main, To seek protection in far distant skies; But none they found. It seem'd the general air, From pole to pole, from Atlas to the East, Was then at enmity with English blood. For, but the race of England, all were safe In foreign climes; nor did this Fury taste The foreign blood which England then contain'd. Where should they fly? The circumambient heaven Involv'd them still; and every breeze was bane. Where find relief? The salutary art Was mute; and, startled at the new disease, In fearful whispers hopeless omens gave. To Heaven with suppliant rites they sent their pray'rs; Heav'n heard them not. Of every hope depriv'd; Fatigu'd with vain resources; and subdued With woes resistless and enfeebling fear; Passive they sunk beneath the weighty blow. Nothing but lamentable sounds was heard, Nor aught was seen but ghastly views of death. Infectious horror ran from face to face, And pale despair. 'Twas all the business then To tend the sick, and in their turns to die. In heaps they fell: and oft one bed, they say, The sick'ning, dying, and the dead contain'd. Ye guardian Gods, on whom the Fates depend Of tottering Albion! ye eternal Fires That lead thro' heav'n the wandering year! ye powers That o'er th' incircling elements preside! May nothing worse than what this age has seen Arrive! Enough abroad, enough at home Has Albion bled. Here a distemper'd heaven Has thin'd her cities; from those lofty cliffs That awe proud Gaul, to Thule's wintry reign; While in the West, beyond th' Atlantic foam, Her bravest sons, keen for the fight, have dy'd The death of cowards and of common men: Sunk void of wounds, and fall'n without renown. But from these views the weeping Muses turn, And other themes invite my wandering song. BOOK IV. THE PASSIONS. The choice of Aliment, the choice of Air, The use of Toil and all external things, Already sung; it now remains to trace What good, what evil from ourselves proceeds: And how the subtle Principle within Inspires with health, or mines with strange decay The passive Body. Ye poetic Shades, Who know the secrets of the world unseen, Assist my song! For, in a doubtful theme Engag'd, I wander thro' mysterious ways. There is, they say, (and I believe there is) A spark within us of th' immortal fire, That animates and moulds the grosser frame; And when the body sinks escapes to heaven, Its native seat, and mixes with the Gods. Mean while this heavenly particle pervades The mortal elements; in every nerve It thrills with pleasure, or grows mad with pain, And, in its secret conclave, as it feels The body's woes and joys, this ruling power Wields at its will the dull material world, And is the body's health or malady. By its own toil the gross corporeal frame Fatigues, extenuates, or destroys itself. Nor less the labours of the mind corrode The solid fabric: for by subtle parts And viewless atoms, secret Nature moves The mighty wheels of this stupendous world. By subtle fluids pour'd thro' subtle tubes The natural, vital, functions are perform'd. By these the stubborn aliments are tam'd; The toiling heart distributes life and strength; These the still-crumbling frame rebuild; and these Are lost in thinking, and dissolve in air. But 'tis not Thought (for still the soul's employ'd) 'Tis painful thinking that corrodes our clay. All day the vacant eye without fatigue Strays o'er the heaven and earth; but long intent On microscopic arts its vigour fails. Just so the mind, with various thought amus'd, Nor akes itself, nor gives the body pain. But anxious Study, Discontent, and Care, Love without hope, and Hate without revenge, And Fear, and Jealousy, fatigue the soul, Engross the subtle ministers of life, And spoil the lab'ring functions of their share. Hence the lean gloom that Melancholy wears; The Lover's paleness; and the sallow hue Of Envy, Jealousy; the meagre stare Of sore Revenge: the canker'd body hence Betrays each fretful motion of the mind. The strong-built pedant; who both night and day Feeds on the coarsest fare the schools bestow, And crudely fattens at gross Burman's stall; O'erwhelm'd with phlegm lies in a dropsy drown'd, Or sinks in lethargy before his time. With useful studies you, and arts that please Employ your mind, amuse but not fatigue. Peace to each drousy metaphysic sage! And ever may all heavy systems rest! Yet some there are, even of elastic parts, Whom strong and obstinate ambition leads Thro' all the rugged roads of barren lore, And gives to relish what their generous taste Would else refuse. But may nor thirst of fame, Nor love of knowledge, urge you to fatigue With constant drudgery the liberal soul. Toy with your books: and, as the various fits Of humour seize you, from Philosophy To Fable shift; from serious Antonine To Rabelais' ravings, and from prose to song. While reading pleases, but no longer, read; And read aloud resounding Homer's strain, And wield the thunder of Demosthenes. The chest so exercis'd improves its strength; And quick vibrations thro' the bowels drive The restless blood, which in unactive days Would loiter else thro' unelastic tubes, Deem it not trifling while I recommend What posture suits: To stand and sit by turns, As nature prompts, is best. But o'er your leaves To lean for ever, cramps the vital parts, And robs the fine machinery of its play. 'Tis the great art of life to manage well The restless mind. For ever on pursuit Of knowledge bent, it starves the grosser powers: Quite unemploy'd, against its own repose It turns its fatal edge, and sharper pangs Than what the body knows embitter life. Chiefly where Solitude, sad nurse of Care, To sickly musing gives the pensive mind. There Madness enters; and the dim-ey'd Fiend, Sour Melancholy, night and day provokes Her own eternal wound. The sun grows pale; A mournful visionary light o'erspreads The chearful face of nature: earth becomes A dreary desart, and heaven frowns above. Then various shapes of curs'd illusion rise: Whate'er the wretched fears, creating Fear Forms out of nothing; and with monsters teems Unknown in hell. The prostrate soul beneath A load of huge imagination heaves; And all the horrors that the murderer feels With anxious flutterings wake the guiltless breast. Such phantoms Pride in solitary scenes, Of Fear, on delicate Self-love creates. From other cares absolv'd, the busy mind Finds in yourself a theme to pore upon; It finds you miserable, or makes you so. For while yourself you anxiously explore, Timorous Self-love, with sickning Fancy's aid, Presents the danger that you dread the most, And ever galls you in your tender part. Hence some for love, and some for jealousy, For grim religion some, and some for pride, Have lost their reason: some for fear of want Want all their lives; and others every day For fear of dying suffer worse than death. Ah! from your bosoms banish, if you can, Those fatal guests: and first the DÃ¦mon Fear; That trembles at impossible events, Lest aged Atlas should resign his load, And heaven's eternal battlements rush down. Is there an evil worse than Fear itself? And what avails it, that indulgent heaven From mortal eyes has wrapt the woes to come, If we, ingenious to torment ourselves, Grow pale at hideous fictions of our own? Enjoy the present; nor with needless cares, Of what may spring from blind misfortune's womb, Appall the surest hour that life bestows. Serene, and master of yourself, prepare For what may come; and leave the rest to Heaven. Oft from the Body, by long ails mistun'd, These evils sprung the most important health, That of the Mind, destroy: and when the mind They first invade, the conscious body soon In sympathetic languishment declines. These chronic Passions, while from real woes They rise, and yet without the body's fault Infest the soul, admit one only cure; Diversion, hurry, and a restless life. Vain are the consolations of the wise; In vain your friends would reason down your pain. O ye, whose souls relentless love has tam'd To soft distress, or friends untimely fal'n! Court not the luxury of tender thought; Nor deem it impious to forget those pains That hurt the living, nought avail the dead. Go, soft enthusiast! quit the cypress groves, Nor to the rivulet's lonely moanings tune Your sad complaint. Go, seek the chearful haunts Of men, and mingle with the bustling croud; Lay schemes for wealth, or power, or same, the wish Of nobler minds, and push them night and day. Or join the caravan in quest of scenes New to your eyes, and shifting every hour, Beyond the Alps, beyond the Apennines. Or more advent'rous, rush into the field Where war grows hot; and, raging thro' the sky, The lofty trumpet swells the madd'ning soul: And in the hardy camp and toilsome march Forget all softer and less manly cares. But most too passive, when the blood runs low, Too weakly indolent to strive with pain, And bravely by resisting conquer Fate, Try Circe's arts; and in the tempting bowl Of poison'd Nectar sweet oblivion swill. Struck by the pow'rful charm, the gloom dissolves In empty air; Elysium opens round, A pleasing phrenzy buoys the lighten'd soul, And sanguine hopes dispel your fleeting care; And what was difficult, and what was dire, Yields to your prowess and superior stars: The happiest you of all that e'er were mad, Or are, or shall be, could this folly last. But soon your heaven is gone; a heavier gloom Shuts o'er your head: and, as the thund'ring stream, Swoln o'er its banks with sudden mountain rain, Sinks from its tumult to a silent brook; So, when the frantic raptures in your breast Subside, you languish into mortal man; You sleep, and waking find yourself undone. For prodigal of life in one rash night You lavish'd more than might support three days. A heavy morning comes; your cares return With tenfold rage. An anxious stomach well May be endur'd; so may the throbbing head: But such a dim delirium, such a dream, Involves you; such a dastardly despair Unmans your soul, as madd'ning Pentheus felt, When, baited round CithÃ¦ron's cruel sides, He saw two Suns, and double Thebes ascend. You curse the sluggish Port; you curse the wretch, The felon, with unnatural mixture first Who dar'd to violate the virgin Wine. Or on the fugitive Champain you pour A thousand curses; for to heav'n it rapt Your soul, to plunge you deeper in despair. Perhaps you rue even that divinest gift, The gay, serene, good-natur'd Burgundy, Or the fresh fragrant vintage of the Rhine: And wish that heaven from mortals had with-held The grape, and all intoxicating bowls. Besides, it wounds you sore to recollect What follies in your loose unguarded hour Escap'd. For one irrevocable word, Perhaps that meant no harm, you lose a friend. Or in the rage of wine your hasty hand Performs a deed to haunt you to the grave. Add that your means, your health, your parts decay; Your friends avoid you; brutishly transform'd They hardly know you; or if one remains To wish you well, he wishes you in heaven. Despis'd, unwept you fall; who might have left A sacred, cherish'd, sadly-pleasing name; A name still to be utter'd with a sigh. Your last ungraceful scene has quite effac'd All sense and memory of your former worth. How to live happiest; how avoid the pains, The disappointments, and disgusts of those Who would in pleasure all their hours employ; The Precepts here of a divine old man I could recite. Tho' old, he still retain'd His manly sense, and energy of mind. Virtuous and wise he was, but not severe; He still remember'd that he once was young; His easy presence check'd no decent joy. Him even the dissolute admir'd; for he A graceful looseness when he pleas'd put on, And laughing could instruct. Much had he read, Much more had seen; he studied from the life, And in th' original perus'd mankind. Vers'd in the woes and vanities of life, He pitied Man: and much he pitied those Whom falsely-smiling Fate has curs'd with means To dissipate their days in quest of joy. Our aim is happiness; 'tis yours, 'tis mine, He said, 'tis the pursuit of all that live; Yet few attain it, if 'twas e'er attain'd. But they the widest wander from the mark, Who thro' the flow'ry paths of saunt'ring Joy Seek this coy Goddess; that from stage to stage Invites us still, but shifts as we pursue. For, not to name the pains that pleasure brings To counterpoise itself, relentless Fate Forbids that we thro' gay voluptuous wilds, Should ever roam: and were the Fates more kind, Our narrow luxuries would soon grow stale. Were these exhaustless, Nature would grow sick, And, cloy'd with pleasure, squeamishly complain That all is vanity, and life a dream. Let nature rest: be busy for yourself, And for your friend; be busy even in vain Rather than teize her sated appetites. Who never fasts, no banquet e'er enjoys; Who never toils or watches, never sleeps. Let nature rest: and when the taste of joy Grows keen, indulge; but shun satiety. 'Tis not for mortals always to be blest. But him the least the dull or painful hours Of life oppress, whom sober Sense conducts, And Virtue, thro' this labyrinth we tread. Virtue and Sense I mean not to disjoin; Virtue and Sense are one: and, trust me, still A faithless Heart betrays the Head unsound, Virtue (for mere Good-nature is a fool) Is Sense and Spirit, with Humanity: 'Tis sometimes angry, and its frown confounds; 'Tis even vindictive, but in vengeance just. Knaves fain would laugh at it; some great ones dare; But at his heart the most undaunted son Of fortune dreads its name and awful charms. To hoblest uses this determines wealth; This is the solid pomp of prosperous days; The peace and shelter of adversity. And if you pant for glory, build your fame On this foundation, which the secret shock Defies of Envy and all-sapping time. The gawdy gloss of fortune only strikes The vulgar eye: the suffrage of the wise, The praise that's worth ambition, is attain'd By Sense alone, and dignity of mind. Virtue, the strength and beauty of the soul, Is the best gift of heaven: a happiness That even above the smiles and frowns of fate Exalts great Nature's favourites: a wealth That ne'er encumbers, nor can be transferr'd. Riches are oft by guilt and baseness earn'd; Or dealt by chance, to shield a lucky knave, Or throw a cruel sun-shine on a fool. But for one end, one much-neglected use, Are riches worth your care: (for Nature's wants Are few, and without opulence supply'd.) This noble end is, to produce the Soul; To shrew the virtues in their fairest light; To make Humanity the Minister Of bounteous Providence; and teach the breast That generous luxury the Gods enjoy. Thus, in his graver vein, the friendly Sage Sometimes declaim'd. Of Right and Wrong he taught Truths as refin'd as ever Athens heard; And (strange to tell!) he practis'd what he preach'd. Skill'd in the Passions, how to check their sway He knew, as far as Reason can controul The lawless Powers. But other cares are mine: Form'd in the school of PÃ¦on, I relate What Passions hurt the body, what improve: Avoid them, or invite them, as you may. Know then, whatever chearful and serene Supports the mind, supports the body too. Hence, the most vital movement mortals feel Is Hope; the balm and life-blood of the soul. It pleases, and it lasts. Indulgent heaven Sent down the kind delusion, thro' the paths Of rugged life to lead us patient on; And make our happiest state no tedious thing. Our greatest good, and what we least can spare, Is Hope: the last of all our evils, Fear. But there are Passions grateful to the breast, And yet no friends to Life: perhaps they please Or to excess, and dissipate the soul; Or while they please, torment. The stubborn Clown, The ill-tam'd Ruffian, and pale Usurer, (If Love's omnipotence such hearts can mould) May safely mellow into love; and grow Refin'd, humane, and generous, if they can. Love in such bosoms never to a fault Or pains or pleases. But, ye finer Souls, Form'd to soft luxury, and prompt to thrill With all the tumults, all the joys and pains, That beauty gives; with caution and reserve Indulge the sweet destroyer of repose, Nor court too much the Queen of charming cares. For, while the cherish'd poison in your breast Ferments and maddens; sick with jealousy, Absence, distrust, or even with anxious joy, The wholesome appetites and powers of life Dissolve in languor. The coy stomach loaths The genial board: Your chearful days are gone; The generous bloom that flush'd your cheeks is fled. To sighs devoted and to tender pains, Pensive you sit, or solitary stray, And waste your youth in musing. Musing first Toy'd into care your unsuspecting heart: It found a liking there, a sportful fire, And that fomented into serious love; Which musing daily strengthens and improves Thro' all the heights of fondness and romance: And you're undone, the fatal shaft has sped, If once you doubt whether you love or no. The body wastes away; th' infected mind, Dissolv'd in female tenderness, forgets Each manly virtue, and grows dead to fame. Sweet heaven from such intoxicating charms Defend all worthy breasts! Not that I deem Love always dangerous, always to be shun'd. Love well repaid, and not too weakly sunk In wanton and unmanly tenderness, Adds bloom to Health; o'er ev'ry virtue sheds A gay, humane, a sweet, and generous grace, And brightens all the ornaments of man. But fruitless, hopeless, disappointed, rack'd With jealousy, fatigu'd with hope and fear, Too serious, or too languishingly fond, Unnerves the body and unmans the soul. And some have died for love; and some run mad; And some with desperate hands themselves have slain. Some to extinguish, others to prevent, A mad devotion to one dangerous Fair, Court all they meet; in hopes to dissipate The cares of Love amongst an hundred Brides. Th' event is doubtful: for there are who find A cure in this; there are who find it not. 'Tis no relief, alas! it rather galls The wound, to those who are sincerely sick. For while from feverish and tumultuous joys The nerves grow languid and the soul subsides, The tender fancy smarts with every sting, And what was Love before is Madness now. Is health your care, or luxury your aim, Be temperate still: When Nature bids, obey; Her wild impatient sallies bear no curb: But when the prurient habit of delight, Or loose Imagination, spurs you on To deeds above your strength, impute it not To Nature: Nature all compulsion hates. Ah! let nor luxury nor vain renown Urge you to feats you well might sleep without; To make what should be rapture a fatigue, A tedious task; nor in the wanton arms Of twining LaÃ¯s melt your manhood down. For from the colliquation of soft joys How chang'd you rise! the ghost of what you was! Languid, and melancholy, and gaunt, and wan; Your veins exhausted, and your nerves unstrung. Spoil'd of its balm and sprightly zest, the blood Grows vapid phlegm; along the tender nerves (To each slight impulse tremblingly awake) A subtle Fiend that mimics all the plagues Rapid and restless springs from part to part. The blooming honours of your youth are fallen; Your vigour pines; your vital powers decay; Diseases haunt you; and untimely Age Creeps on; unsocial, impotent, and lewd. Infatuate, impious, epicure! to waste The stores of pleasure, chearfulness, and health! Infatuate all who make delight their trade, And coy perdition every hour pursue. Who pines with Love, or in lascivious flames Consumes, is with his own consent undone: He chuses to be wretched, to be mad; And warn'd proceeds and wilful to his fate. But there's a Passion, whose tempestuous sway Tears up each virtue planted in the breast, And shakes to ruins proud Philosophy. For pale and trembling Anger rushes in, With fault'ring speech, and eyes that wildly stare; Fierce as the Tiger, madder than the seas, Desperate, and arm'd with more than human strength. How soon the calm, humane, and polish'd man Forgets compunction, and starts up a fiend! Who pines in Love, or wastes with silent Cares, Envy, or ignominy, or tender grief, Slowly descends, and ling'ring, to the shades. But he whom Anger stings, drops, if he dies, At once, and rushes apoplectic down; Or a fierce fever hurries him to hell. For, as the Body thro' unnumber'd strings Reverberates each vibration of the Soul; As is the Passion, such is still the Pain The Body feels: or chronic, or acute. And oft a sudden storm at once o'erpowers The Life, or gives your Reason to the winds. Such fates attend the rash alarm of Fear, And sudden Grief, and Rage, and sudden Joy. There are, mean time, to whom the boist'rous fit Is Health, and only fills the sails of life. For where the mind a torpid winter leads, Wrapt in a body corpulent and cold, And each clogg'd function lazily moves on; A generous sally spurns th' incumbent load, Unlocks the breast, and gives a cordial glow. But if your wrathful blood is apt to boil, Or are your nerves too irritably strung, Wave all dispute; be cautious, if you joke; Keep Lent for ever; and forswear the Bowl. For one rash moment sends you to the shades, Or shatters ev'ry hopeful scheme of life, And gives to horror all your days to come. Fate, arm'd with thunder, fire, and ev'ry plague, That ruins, tortures, or distracts mankind, And makes the happy wretched in an hour, O'erwhelms you not with woes so horrible As your own wrath, nor gives more sudden blows. While Choler works, good Friend, you may be wrong; Distrust yourself, and sleep before you fight. 'Tis not too late to morrow to be brave; If honour bids, to morrow kill or die. But calm advice against a raging fit Avails too little; and it braves the power Of all that ever taught in Prose or Song, To tame the Fiend that sleeps a gentle Lamb, And wakes a Lion. Unprovok'd and calm, You reason well; see as you ought to see, And wonder at the madness of mankind: Seiz'd with the common rage, you soon forget The speculations of your wiser hours. Beset with Furies of all deadly shapes, Fierce and insidious, violent and slow: With all that urge or lure us on to Fate: What refuge shall we seek? what arms prepare? Where Reason proves too weak, or void of wiles To cope with subtle or impetuous powers, I would invoke new Passions to your aid: With Indignation would extinguish Fear, With Fear or generous Pity vanquish Rage, And Love with Pride; and force to force oppose. There is a Charm, a Power, that sways the breast; Bids every Passion revel or be still; Inspires with Rage, or all your Cares dissolves; Can sooth Distraction, and almost Despair. That power is Music: Far beyond the stretch Of those unmeaning warblers on our stage; Those clumsy Heroes, those fat-headed Gods, Who move no passion justly but Contempt: Who, like our dancers (light indeed and strong!) Do wond'rous feats, but never heard of grace. The fault is ours; we bear those monstrous arts; Good Heaven! we praise them: we, with loudest peals, Applaud the fool that highest lifts his heels; And, with insipid shew of rapture, die Of ideot notes impertinently long. But he the Muse's laurel justly shares, A Poet he, and touch'd with Heaven's own fire; Who, with bold rage or solemn pomp of sounds, Inflames, exalts, and ravishes the soul; Now tender, plaintive, sweet almost to pain, In Love dissolves you; now in sprightly strains Breathes a gay rapture thro' your thrilling breast; Or melts the heart with airs divinely sad; Or wakes to horror the tremendous strings. Such was the Bard, whose heavenly strains of old Appeas'd the fiend of melancholy Saul. Such was, if old and heathen fame say true, The man who bade the Theban domes ascend, And tam'd the savage nations with his song; And such the Thracian, whose melodious lyre, Tun'd to soft woe, made all the mountains weep; Sooth'd even th' inexorable powers of Hell, And half redeem'd his lost Eurydice. Music exalts each Joy, allays each Grief, Expels Diseases, softens every Pain, Subdues the rage of Poison, and the Plague; And hence the wise of ancient days ador'd One Power of Physic, Melody, and Song. THE END. OF BENEVOLENCE: AN EPISTLE to EUMENES. FIRST PRINTED IN THE YEAR MDCCLI. This little piece was addressed to a worthy Gentleman, as an expression of gratitude for his kind endeavours to do the Author a great piece of service. Kind to my frailties still, Eumenes, hear; Once more I try the patience of your ear. Not oft I sing: the happier for the town, So stun'd already they're quite stupid grown With monthly, dailyâcharming things I own. Happy for them, I seldom court the Nine; Another art, a serious art is mine. Of nauseous verses offer'd once a week, You cannot say I did it, if you're sick. 'Twas ne'er my pride to shine by flashy fits Amongst the daily, weekly, monthly wits. Content if some few friends indulge my name, So slightly am I stung with love of fame, I would not scrawl one hundred idle linesâ Not for the praise of all the Magazines. Yet once a moon, perhaps, I steal a night; And, if our sire Apollo pleases, write. You smile; but all the train the Muse that follow, Christians and dunces, still we quote Apollo. Unhappy still our poets will rehearse To Goths, that stare astonish'd at their verse; To the rank tribes submit their virgin lays: So gross, so bestial, is the lust of praise! I to sound judges from the mob appeal, And write to those who most my subject feel. Eumenes, these dry moral lines I trust With you, whom nought that's moral can disgust. With you I venture, in plain home-spun sense, What I imagine of Benevolence. Of all the monsters of the human kind, What strikes you most is the low selfish mind. You wonder how, without one liberal joy, The fteady miser can his years employ; Without one friend, howe'er his fortunes thrive, Despis'd and hated, how he bears to live. With honest warmth of heart, with some degree Of pity that such wretched things should be, You scorn the sordid knaveâHe grins at you, And deems himself the wiser of the two.â 'Tis all but taste, howe'er we sift the case; He has his joy, as every creature has. 'Tis true, he cannot boast an angel's share, Yet has what happiness his organs bear. Thou likewise mad'st the high seraphic soul, Maker Omnipotent! and thou the owl. Heav'n form'd him too, and doubtless for some use; But Crane-court knows not yet all nature's views. 'Tis chiefly taste, or blunt, or gross, or fine, Makes life insipid, bestial, or divine. Better be born with taste to little rent, Than the dull monarch of a continent. Without this bounty which the Gods bestow, Can fortune make one favourite happy?âNo. As well might fortune in her frolic vein, Proclaim an Oyster sovereign of the main. Without fine nerves, and bosom justly warm'd, An eye, an ear, a fancy to be charm'd, In vain majestic Wren expands the dome; Blank as pale stucco Rubens lines the room; Lost are the raptures of bold Handel's strain; Great Tully storms, sweet Virgil sings, in vain. The beauteous forms of nature are effac'd; Tempe's soft charms, the raging watry waste, Each greatly-wild, each sweet romantic scene Unheeded rises, and almost unseen. Yet these are joys, with some of better clay, To sooth the toils of life's embarras'd way. These the fine frame with charming horrors chill, And give the nerves delightfully to thrill. But of all Taste the noblest and the best, The first enjoyment of the generous breast, Is to behold in man's obnoxious state Scenes of content, and happy turns of fate. Fair views of nature, shining works of art, Amuse the fancy: but those touch the heart. Chiefly for this proud epic song delights, For this some riot on th' Arabian Nights. Each case is outs: and for the human mind 'Tis monstrous not to feel for all mankind. Were all mankind unhappy, who could taste Elysium? or be solitarily blest? Shock'd with surrounding shapes of human woe, All that or sense or fancy could bestow, You would reject with sick and coy disdain, And pant to see one chearful face again. But if life's better prospects to behold So much delight the man of generous mould; How happy they, the great, the godlike few, Who daily cultivate this pleasing view! This is a joy possess'd by few indeed! Dame fortune has so many fools to feed, She cannot oft afford, with all her store, To yield her smiles where nature smil'd before. To sinking worth a cordial hand to lend; With better fortune to surprize a friend; To chear the modest stranger's lonely state; Or snatch an orphan family from fate; To do, possess'd with virtue's noblest fire, Such generous deeds as we with tears admire; Deeds that, above ambition's vulgar aim, Secure an amiable, a solid fame: These are such joys as heaven's first favourites seize; These please you now, and will for ever please. Too seldom we great moral deeds admire; The will, the power, th' occasion must conspire. Yet few there are so impotent and low, But can some small good offices bestow. Small as they are, however cheap they come, They add still something to the general sum: And him who gives the little in his power, The world acquits; and heaven demands no more. Unhappy he! who feels each neighbour's woe, Yet no relief, no comfort can bestow. Unhappy too, who feels each kind essay, And for great favours has but words to pay; Who, scornful of the flatterer's fawning art, Dreads even to pour his gratitude of heart; And with a distant lover's silent pain Must the best movements of his soul restrain. But men sagacious to explore mankind Trace even the coyest passions of the mind. Not only to the good we owe good-will; In good and bad distress demands it still. 'This with the generous lays distinction low, Endears a friend, and recommends a foe. Not that resentment never ought to rise; For even excess of virtue ranks with vice: And there are villainies no bench can awe, That sport without the limits of the law. No laws th' ungenerous crime would reprehend Could I forget Eumenes was my friend: In vain the gibbet or the pillory claim The wretch who blasts a helpless virgin's fame. Where laws are dup'd, 'tis nor unjust nor mean To seize the proper time for honest spleen. An open candid foe I could not hate, Nor even insult the base in humbled state; But thriving malice tamely to forgiveâ 'Tis somewhat late to be so primitive. But I detain you with these tedious lays, Which few perhaps would read, and fewer praise. No matter: could I please the polish'd few Who taste the serious or the gay like you, The squeamish mob may find my verses bare Of every graceâbut curse Me if I care. Besides, I little court Parnassian fame; There's yet a better than a poet's name. 'Twould more indulge my pride to hear it said That I with you the paths of honour tread, Than that amongst the proud poetic train No modern boasted a more classic vein; Or that in numbers I let loose my song, Smooth as the Tweed, and as the Severn strong. TASTE: AN EPISTLE TO A YOUNG CRITIC. FIRST PRINTED IN THE YEAR MDCCLIII. Proferre quÃ¦ sentiat cur quisquam liber dubitet?âMalim, mebercule, solus insanire, quam sobrius aut plebis aut patrum delirationibus ignaviter assentari.â Autor anonym, Fragm. Range from Tower-hill all London to the Fleet, Thence round the Temple, t'utmost Grosvenor-street: Take in your route both Gray's and Lincoln's Inn; Miss not, be sure, my Lords and Gentlemen; You'll hardly raise, as I with Sir William Petty, author of the Political Aritbmetic. Petty guess, Above twelve thousand men of taste; unless In desperate times a Connoisseur may pass. âA Connoisseur! What's that?â 'Tis hard to say: But you must oft amidst the fair and gay Have seen a wou'd-be rake, a fluttering fool, Who swears he loves the sex with all his soul. Alas, vain youth! dost thou admire sweet Jones? Thou be gallant without or blood or bones! You'd split to hear th' insipid coxcomb cry Ah charming Nanny! 'tis too much! I die!â Die and be dân'd, says one; but let me tell ye I'll pay the loss if ever rapture kill ye. 'Tis easy learnt the art to talk by rote: At Nando's 'twill but cost you half a groat; The Bedford school at three-pence is not dear, Sir; At White'sâthe stars instruct you for a tester. But he, whom nature never meant to share One spark of taste, will never catch it there:â Nor no where else; howe'er the booby beau Grows great with Pope, and Horace, and Boileau. Good native Taste, tho' rude, is seldom wrong, Be it in music, painting, or in song. But this, as well as other faculties, Improves with age and ripens by degrees. I know, my dear; 'tis needless to deny't, You like Voiture, you think him wondrous bright: But seven years hence, your relish more matur'd, What now delights will hardly be endur'd. The boy may live to taste Racine's fine charms, Whom Lee's bald orb or Rowe's dry rapture warms: But he, enfranchis'd from his tutor's care, Who places Butler near Cervantes' chair; Or with Erasmus can admit to vie Brown of Squab-hall of merry memory; Will die a Goth: and nod at Alluding to the Gothic heaven, Woden's hall; where the happy are for ever employed in drinking beer, mum, and other comfortable liquors out of the skulls of those whom they had slain in battle. Woden's feast, Th' eternal winter long, on Pope Gregory the VIth, distinguished by the name of St. Gregory; whose pious zeal, in the cause of barbarous ignorance and priestly tyranny, exerted itself in demolishing, to the utmost of his power, all the remains of heathen genius. Gregory's breast. Long may he swill, this patriarch of the dull, The drowsy MumâBut touch not Maro's skull! His holy barbarous dotage sought to doom, Good heaven! th' immortal classics to the tomb!â Those sacred lights shall bid new genius rise When all Rome's saints have rotted from the skies, Be these your guides, if at the ivy crown You aim; each country's classics, and your own. But chiefly with the ancients pass your prime, And drink Castalia at the fountain's brim. The man to genuine Burgundy bred up, Soon starts the dash of Methuen in his cup. Those sovereign masters of the Muses skill Are the true patterns of good writing still. Their ore was rich and seven times purg'd of lead; Their art seem'd nature, 'twas so finely hid. Tho' born with all the powers of writing well, What pains it cost they did not blush to tell. Their ease (my Lords!) ne'er lowng'd for want of fire, Nor did their rage thro' affectation tire. Free from all tawdry and imposing glare They trusted to their native grace of air. Rapt'rous and wild the trembling soul they seize, Or sly coy beauties steal it by degrees; The more you view them still the more they please. Yet there are thousands of scholastic merit Who worm their sense out but ne'er taste their spirit. Witness each pedant under Bentley bred; Each commentator that e'er commented. (You scarce can seize a spot of classic ground, With leagues of Dutch morass so floated round.) Witnessâbut, Sir, I hold a cautious pen, Lest I should wrong some honourable men. They grow enthusiasts tooâ'Tis true! 'tis pity! But 'tis not every lunatic that's witty. Some have run Maroâand some Miltonâmad, Ashley once turn'd a solid barber's head: Hear all that's said or printed if you can, Ashley has turn'd more solid heads than one. Let such admire each great or specious name; For right or wrong the joy to them's the same. âRight!â Yes a thousand times.âEach fool has heard That Homer was a wonder of a bard, Despise them civilly with all my heartâ But to convince them is a desperate part. Why should you teize one for what secret cause One doats on Horace, or on Hudibras? 'Tis cruel, Sir, 'tis needless, to endeavour To teach a sot of Taste he knows no flavour. To disunite I neither wish nor hope A stubborn blockhead from his fav'rite fop. Yesâfop I say, were Maro's self before 'em: For Maro's self grows dull as they pore o'er him. But hear their raptures o'er some specious rhime Dub'd by the musk'd and greasy mob sublime. For spleen's dear sake hear how a coxcomb prates As clam'rous o'er his joys as fifty cats; âMusic has charms to sooth a savage breast, âTo soften rocks, and oaks,ââand all the rest: âI've heardââBless these long ears!ââHeav'ns what a strain! âGood God! What thunders burst in this Campaign! âHark Waller warbles! Ah! how sweetly killing! âThen that inimitable Splendid Shilling! âRowe breathes all Shakespear here!âThat ode of âPrior âIs Spencer quite! egad his very fire!â âAs likeââYes faith! as gum-flowers to the rose, Or as to Claret flat Minorca's dose; As like as (if I am not grosly wrong) Erle Robert's Mice to aught e'er Chaucer sung. Read boldly, and unprejudic'd peruse Each fav'rite modern, ev'n each ancient muse. With all the comic salt and tragic rage The great stupendous genius of our stage, Boast of our island, pride of human-kind, Had faults to which the boxes are not blind. His frailties are to ev'ry gossip known: Yet Milton's pedantries not shock the town. Ne'er be the dupe of Names, however high; For some outlive good parts, some misapply. Each elegant Spectator you admire; But must you therefore swear by Cato's fire? Masques for the court, and oft a clumsey jest, Disgrac'd the muse that wrought the Alchemist. âBut to the ancients.ââFaith! I am not clear, For all the smooth round type of Elzevir, That every work which lasts in prose or song, Two thousand years, deserves to last so long. For not to mention some eternal blades Known only now in th' academic shades, (Those sacred groves where raptur'd spirits stray, And in word-hunting waste the live-long day) Ancients whom none but curious critics scan, Do, read A poem of Tibullus's in hexameter verse; as yawning and insipid as his elegies are tender and natural. Messala's praises if you can. Ah! who but feels the sweet contagious smart While soft Tibullus pours his tender heart? With him the Loves and Muses melt in tears; But not a word of some hexameters. âYou grow so squeamish and so dev'lish dry, âYou'll call Lucretius vapid next.â Not I. Some find him tedious, others think him lame: But if he lags his subject is to blame. Rough weary roads thro' barren wilds he tried, Yet still he marches with true Roman pride: Sometimes a meteor, gorgeous, rapid, bright, He streams athwart the philosophic night. Find you in Horace no insipid Odes?â He dar'd to tell us Homer sometimes nods; And but for such a critic's hardy skill Homer might slumber unsuspected still. Tasteless, implicit, indolent and tame, At second-hand we chiefly praise or blame. Hence 'tis, for else one knows not why nor how, Some authors flourish for a year or two: For many some, more wond'rous still to tell; Farquhar yet lingers on the brink of hell. Of solid merit others pine unknown; At first, tho' Don Carlos, a tragedy of Otway's, now long and justly forgotten, went off with great applause; while his Orphan, somewhat better performance, and what is yet more strange, his Venice Preserved, according to the theatrical anecdotes of those aimes, met with a very cold reception. Carlos swimmingly went down, Poor Belvidera fail'd to melt the town. Sunk in dead night the giant Milton lay 'Till Sommer's hand produc'd him to the day. But, thanks to heav'n and Addison's good grace Now ev'ry fop is charm'd with Chevy Chace. Specious and sage, the sovereign of the flock Led to the downs, or from the wave-worn rock Reluctant hurl'd, the tame implicit train Or crop the downs, or headlong seek the main. As blindly we our solemn leaders follow, And good, and bad, and execrable swallow. Pray, on the first throng'd evening of a play That wears the The appearance of the face in the last stage of a consumption, as it is described by Hippocrates. facies Hippocratica, Strong lines of death, signs dire of reprobation; Have you not seen the angel of salvation Appear sublime; with wise and solemn rap To teach the doubtful rabble where to clap?â The rabble knows not where our dramas shine; But where the cane goes patâby Gâthat's fine! Judge for yourself; nor wait with timid phlegm 'Till some illustrious pedant hum or hem. The lords who starv'd old Ben were learn'dly fond Of Chaucer, whom with bungling toil they conn'd. Their sons, whose ears bold Milton could not seize, Would laugh o'er Ben like mad, and snuff and sneeze, And swear, and seem as tickled as you please. Their spawn, the pride of this sublimer age, Feel to the toes and horns grave Milton's rage.

Judge for yourself; and as you find report Of wit as freely as of beef or port. Zounds! shall a pert or bluff important wight, Whose brain is fanciless, whose blood is white; A mumbling ape of taste; prescribe us laws To try the poets, for no better cause Than that he boasts per ann. ten thousand clear, Yelps in the House, or barely sits a Peer? For shame! for shame! the liberal British soul To stoop to any stale dictator's rule! I may be wrong, and often am no doubt, But right or wrong with friends with foes 'twill out. Thus 'tis perhaps my fault if I complain Of trite invention and a flimsy vein, Tame characters, uninteresting, jejune, And passions drily copied from First painter to Lewis XIV. who, to speak in faihionable French English, called himself Lewis the Great. Our sovereign lords the passions, Love, Rage, Despair, &amp;c. were graciously pleased to sit to him in their turns for their portraits: which he was generous enough to communicate to the public; to the great improvement, no doubt, of history-painting. It was he who they say poison'd Le Sueur; who, without half his advantages in many other respects, was so unreasonable and provoking as to display a genius with which his own could stand no comparison. It was he and his Gothic disciples, who, with fly scratches, defac'd the most masterly of this Le Sueur's performances, as often as their barbarous envy could snugly reach them. Yet after all these atchievements he died in his bed! A catastrophe which could not have happened to him in a country like this, where the fine arts are as zealously and judiciously patronised as they are well understood. Le Brun. For I would rather never judge than wrong That friend of all men, generous Fenelon. But in the name of goodness, must I be The dupe of charms I never yet could see? And then to flatter where there's no rewardâ Better be any patron-hunting bard, Who half our Lords with filthy praise besmears, And sing an Anthem to all ministers: Taste th' Attic salt in ev'ry Peer's poor rebus, And crown each Gothic idol for a PhÅbus. Alas! so far from free, so far from brave, We dare not shew the little Taste we have. With us you'll see ev'n vanity controul The most refin'd sensations of the soul. Sad Otway's scenes, great Shakespear's we defy: âLard, Madam! 'tis so unpolite to cry!â âFor shame, my dear! d'ye credit all this stuff?â âI vowâwell, this is innocent enough?â At Athens long ago, the Ladiesâ(married) Dreamt not they misbehav'd tho' they miscarried, When a wild poet with licentious rage Turn'd fifty furies loose upon the stage. They were so tender and so easy mov'd, Heav'ns! how the Grecian ladies must have lov'd! For all the fine sensations still have dwelt, Perhaps, where one was exquisitely felt. Thus he who heavenly Maro truly feels Stands fix'd on Raphael, and at Handel thrills. The grosser senses too, the taste, the smell, Are likely truest where the fine prevail: Who doubts that Horace must have cater'd well? Friend, I'm a shrewd observer, and will guess What books you doat on from your fav'rite mess, Brown and L'Estrange will surely charm whome'er The frothy pertness strikes of weak small-beer. Who steeps the calf's fat Ioin in greasy sauce Will hardly loathe the praise that bastes an ass.

But I am sick of pen and ink; and you Will find this letter long enough. Adieu! IMITATIONS OF SHAKESPEARE AND SPENCER. IMITATIONS OF SHAKESPEARE. [Now Summer with her wanton court is gone] Now Summer with her wanton court is gone To revel on the south side of the world, And flaunt and frolic out the live-long day. While Winter rising pale from northern seas Shakes from his hoary locks the drizzling rheum. A blast so shrewd makes the tall-bodied pines Unsinew'd bend, and heavy-paced bears Sends growling to their savage tenements. Now blows the surly north, and chills throughout The stiffening regions; while, by stronger charms Than Circe e'er or fell Medea brew'd, Each brook that wont to prattle to its banks Lies all bestill'd and wedg'd betwixt its banks, Nor moves the wither'd reeds: and the rash flood That from the mountains held its headstrong course, Buried in livid sheets of vaulting ice, Seen thro' the shameful breaches, idly creeps To pay a scanty tribute to the ocean. What wonder? when the floating wilderness That scorns our miles, and calls Geography A shallow pryer; from whose unsteady mirrour The high-hung pole surveys his dancing locks; When this still-raving deep lies mute and dead, Nor heaves its swelling bosom to the winds. The surges, baited by the fierce north-east Tossing with fretful spleen their angry heads To roar and rush together, Even in the foam of all their madness struck To monumental ice, stand all astride The rocks they washed so late. Such execution, So stern, so sudden, wrought the grisly aspect Of terrible Medusa, ere young Perseus With his keen sabre cropt her horrid head, And laid her serpents rowling on the dust; When wandering thro' the woods she frown'd to stone Their savage tenants: just as the foaming lion Sprung furious on his prey, her speedier power Outrun his haste; no time to languish in, But fix'd in that fierce attitude he stands Like Rage in marble.âNow portly Argosies Lie wedg'd 'twixt Neptune's ribs. The bridg'd abysm Has chang'd our ships to horses; the swift bark Yields to the heavy waggon and the cart, That now from isle to isle maintain the trade; And where the surface-haunting Dolphin led Her sportive young, is now an area fit For the wild school-boy's pastime. Meantime the evening skies, crusted with ice, Shifting from red to black their weighty skirts, Hang mournful o'er the hills; and stealing night Rides the bleak puffing winds, that seem to spit Their foam sparse thro' the welkin, which is nothing If not beheld. Anon the burden'd heaven Shakes from its ample sieve the boulted snow; That fluttering down besprinkles the sad tree In mockery of leaves; piles up the hills To monstrous altitude, and choaks to the lips The deep impervious vales that yawn as low As to the centre, Nature's vasty breaches. While all the pride of men and mortal things Lies whelm'd in heaven's white ruins.â The shivering clown digs his obstructed way Thro' the snow-barricadoed cottage door; And muffled in his home-spun plaid encounters With livid cheeks and rheum-distilling nose The morning's sharp and scourging breath; to count His starving flock whose number's all to short To make the goodly sum of yester-night: Part deep ingurgitated, part yet struggling With their last pantings melt themselves a grave In Winter's bosom; which yields not to the touch Of the pale languid crescet of this world, That now with lean and churlish husbandry Yields heartlesly the remnants of his prime; And like most spendthrifts starves his latter days For former rankness. He with bleary eye Blazons his own disgrace; the harness'd waste Rebellious to his blunt defeated shafts; And idly strikes the chalky mountains tops That rise to kiss the Welkin's ruddy lips; Where all the rash young bullies of the air Mount their quick slender penetrating wings, Whipping the frost-burnt villagers to the bones; And growing with their motion mad and furious, 'Till swoln to tempests they out-rage the thunder; Winnow the chaffy snow, and mock the skies Even with their own artillery retorted; Tear up and throw th' accumulated hills Into the vallies. And as rude hurricanes, Discharged from the wind-swoln cheeks of heaven, Buoy up the swilling skirts of Araby's Inhospitable wilds, And roll the dusty desart thro' the skies, Choaking the liberal air, and smothering Whole caravans at once; such havock spreads This war of heaven and earth, such sudden ruin Visits their houseless citizens, that shrink In the false shelter of the hills together, And hear the tempest howling o'er their heads That by and by o'erwhelms them. The very birds, Those few that troop'd not with the chimeing tribe Of amorous Summer, quit their ruffian element; And with domestic tameness hop and flutter Within the roofs of persecuting man, (Grown hospitable by like sense of sufferance;) Whither the hinds, the debt o' the day discharg'd, From kiln or barn repairing, shut the door On surly Winter; croud the clean-swept hearth And chearful shining fire; and doff the time, The whilst the maids their twirling spindles ply, With musty legends and ear-pathing tales; Of giants, and black necromantic bards, Of air-built castles, feats of madcap knights, And every hollow fiction of romance. And, as their rambling humour leads them, talk Of prodigies, and things of dreadful utterance; That set them all agape, rouse up their hair, And make the ideot drops start from their eyes; Of church-yards belching flames at dead of night, Of walking statues, ghosts unaffable, Haunting the dark waste tower or airless dungeon; Then of the elves that deftly trip the green, Drinking the summer's moonlight from the flowers; And all the toys that phantasy pranks up T' amuse her fools withal.âThus they lash on The snail-pac'd Hyperborean nights, till heaven Hangs with a juster poize: when the murk clouds Roll'd up in heavy wreathes low-bellying, seem To kiss the ground, and all the waste of snow Looks blue beneath 'em; till plump'd with bloating dropsy, Beyond the bounds and ftretch of continence, They burst at once; down pours the hoarded rain, Washing the slippery winter from the hills, And floating all the vallies. The fading scene Melts like a lost enchantment or vain phantasm That can no more abuse. Nature resumes Her old substantial shape; while from the waste Of undistinguishing calamity, Forests, and by their sides wide-skirted plains, Houses and trees arise; and waters flow, That from their dark confinements bursting, spurn Their brittle chains; huge sheets of loosen'd ice Float on their bosoms to the deep, and jarr And clatter as they pass; th' o'erjutting banks, As long unpractic'd to so steep a view, Seem to look dizzy on the moving pomp. Now ev'ry petty brook that crawl'd along, Railing its pebbles, mocks the river's rage, Like the proud frog i' the fable. The huge Danube, While melting mountains rush into its tide, Rolls with such headstrong and unreined course, As it would choak the Euxine's gulphy maw, Bursting his chrystal cerements. The breathing time Of peace expir'd, that hush'd the deafning scenes Of clam'rous indignation, ruffian War Rebels, and Nature stands at odds again: When the rous'd Furies of the fighting winds Torment the main; that swells its angry sides, And churns the foam betwixt its flinty jaws; While thro' the savage dungeon of the night The horrid thunder growls. Th' ambitious waves Assault the skies, and from the bursting clouds Drink the glib lightening; as if the seas Wou'd quench the ever-burning fires of heaven. Strait from their slipp'ry pomp they madly plunge And kiss the lowest pebbles. Wretched they That 'midst such rude vexation of the deep Guide a frail vessel! Better ice-bound still, Than mock'd with liberty thus be resign'd To the rough fortune of the froward time; When Navigation all a-tiptoe stands On such unsteady footing. Now they mount On the tall billow's top, and seem to jowl Against the stars; whence (dreadful eminence!) They see with swimming eyes (enough to hurry round In endless vertigo the dizzy brain) A gulph that swallows vision, with wide mouth Steep-yawning to receive them; down they duck To the rugged bottom of the main, and view The adamantine gates of vaulted hell: Thence toss'd to light again; till borne adrift Against some icy mountains bulging sides They reel, and are no more.âNor less by land Ravage the winds, that in their wayward rage Howl thro' the wide unhospitable glens; That rock the stable-planted towers, and shake The hoary monuments of ancient time Down to their flinty bases; that engage As they would tear the mountains from their roots, And brush the high heavens with their woody heads; Making the stout oaks bow.âBut I forget That sprightly Ver trips on old Winter's heel: Cease we these notes too tragic for the time, Nor jar against great Nature's symphony; When even the blustrous elements grow tuneful, Or listen to the concert. Hark! how loud The cuckoo wakes the solitary wood! Soft sigh the winds as o'er the greens they stray, And murmuring brooks within their channels play. PROGNE's DREAM: Darkly expressive of some past Events that were soon to be revealed to her. Last night I dreamt, Whate'er it may forebode it moves me strangely, That I was rapt into the raving deep; An old and reverend sire conducted me: He plung'd into the bosom of the main, And bade me not to sear but follow him. I followed; with impetuous speed we div'd, And heard the dashing thunder o'er our heads. Many a slippery fathom down we sunk, Beneath all plummets' sound, and reached the bottom. When there, I ask'd my venerable guide If he could tell me where my fister was; He told me that she lay not far from thence Within the bosom of a flinty rock, Where Neptune kept her for his paramour Hid from the jealous Amphitrite's sight; And said he could conduct me to the place. I beg'd he wou'd. Through dreadful ways we past, 'Twixt rocks that frightfully lower'd on either side, Whence here and there the branching coral sprung; O'er dead men's bones we walk'd, o'er heaps of gold and gems, Into a hideous kind of wilderness, Where stood a stern and prison-looking rock, Dawb'd with a mossy verdure all around, The mockery of paint. As we drew near Out sprung a hydra from a den below, A speckl'd fury; fearfully it hiss'd, And roll'd its sea-green eyes so angrily As it wou'd kill with looking. My old guide Against its sharp head hurl'd a rugged stoneâ The curling monster raised a brazen shriek, Wallow'd and died in fitful agonies. We gain'd the cave. Thro' woven adamant I look'd, and saw my sifter all alone. Employ'd she seem'd in writing something sad, So sad she looked: Her cheek was wond'rous wan, Her mournful locks like weary sedges hung. I call'dâshe turning, started when she saw me, And threw her head aside as if asham'd; She wept, but would not speakâI call'd again; Still she was mute.âThen madly I addrest, With all the lion-sinews of despair, To break the flinty ribs that held me out; And with the struggling wak'dâ A STORM; Raised to account for the late return of a Messenger. The sun went down in wrath; The skies foam'd brass, and soon th' unchained wind: Burst from the howling dungeon of the north: And rais'd such high delirium on the main, Such angry clamour; while such boiling waves Flash'd on the peevish eye of moody night, It look'd as if the seas would scald the heavens. Still louder chid the winds, th' enchafed surge Still answered louder; and when the sickly morn Peep'd ruefully through the blotted thick-brow'd east To view the ruinous havock of the dark, The stately towers of Athens seem'd to stand On hollow foam tide-whipt; the ships that lay Scorning the blast within the marble arms Of the sea-chid Portumnus, danc'd like corks Upon th' enraged deep, kicking each other; And some were dash'd to fragments in this fray Against the harbour's rocky chest. The sea So roar'd, so madly raged, so proudly swell'd, As it would thunder full into the streets, And steep the tall Cecropian battlements In foaming brine. The airy citadel, Perch'd like an eagle on a high-brow'd rock, Shook the salt water from its stubborn sides With eager quaking; the Cyclades appear'd Like ducking CormorantsâSuch a mutiny Out-clamour'd all tradition, and gain'd belief To ranting prodigies of heretofore. Seven days it storm'd, &amp;c. AN IMITATION OF SPENCER. Written at Mr. Thomson's desire, to be inserted into the Castle of Indolence. [Full many a fiend did haunt this house of rest] I Full many a fiend did haunt this house of rest, And made of passive wights an easy prey. Here Lethargy with deadly sleep opprest Stretch'd on his back a mighty lubbard lay, Heaving his sides; and snored night and day. To stir him from his traunce it was not eath, And his half-open'd eyne he shut straightway: He led I ween the softest way to death, And taught withouten pain or strife to yield the breath. II Of limbs enormous, but withal unsound, Soft-swoln and pale, here lay the Hydropsie; Unwieldy man, with belly monstrous round For ever fed with watery supply; For still he drank, and yet he still was dry. And here a moping Mystery did sit, Mother of Spleen, in robes of various dye: She call'd herself the Hypochondriack Fit, And frantick seem'd to some, to others seem'd a wit. III A lady was she whimsical and proud, Yet oft thro' fear her pride would crouchen low. She felt or fancied in her fluttering mood All the diseases that the Spitals know, And sought all physick that the shops bestow; And still new leaches and new drugs would try. 'Twas hard to hit her humour high or low, For sometimes she would laugh and sometimes cry, Sometimes would waxen wroth; and all she knew not why. IV Fast by her side a listless virgin pin'd, With aching head and squeamish heart-burnings: Pale, bloated, cold, she seem'd to hate mankind, But lov'd in secret all forbidden things. And here the Tertian shook his chilling wings; And here the Gout, half tyger half a snake, Rag'd with an hundred teeth, an hundred stings: These and a thousand furies more did shake Those weary realms, and kept ease-loving men awake.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME THE SECOND. THE FORCED MARRIAGE, A TRAGEDY. WRITTEN IN THE YEAR MDCCLIV. ACT I. SCENE I. The SCENE, A Hall in STRENI's Castle, in the Kingdom of NAPLES STRENI, VICTORIA, a Servant. STRENI. Go, call her hither;âgo!âyour mistress, woman, My hopeful daughter! VICTORIA. O not yet, my Lord. You are too warmâindeed you are. STRENI. Well then, I'll never see her more. Go tell her so.â Away! SCENE II. STRENI, VICTORIA. VICTORIA. Compose yourself, my Lord. STRENI. My daughter To fly my house! to make herself and me The public jest! 'tis monstrous! VICTORIA. But, my Lordâ STRENI. Fly from her own good fortune to a nunnery! She should have pin'd her life out there, amongst The peevish sisterhood.âBut I'm too gentle; I've been too kind a parent; that's my fault, And I deserve this.â Had I been stern, as many fathers are, She durst as well have leapt the battlements As stolen this flight. VICTORIA. 'Tis true, my Lord, you have been A tender father; and my cousin knows it. STRENI. The day too fixedâand with her own consentâ The match above her proudest hopesâa prize Scarce to be dreamt of!âDeath and distraction! This luckless wretch's flight will ruin all! O God! O God! VICTORIA. Nay, never fear the Count. He'll hardly flinch, his love's too obstinate For that; I'll answer for his constancy, As little as I know him. STRENI. What dost thou say, VICTORIA? Yes, there's comfort in that thought.â All may be well yet, think'st thou?âI'm glad, however, This rash young Hector has not swept her off. She's here, she's safe; and all my fears from him Are gone: thank heaven for that!âMy dear VICTORIA, What wouldst thou say? thou hadst something to impartâ Come, speak. VICTORIA. My Lord, I know not what to say: You're grown so choleric that I dare not speak. You did not use to be thus. I remember When, without fear or thinking twice, I durst Give all my follies their full play before you. But this unwonted rage quite frightens me; It checks my utterance: yet, what need I fear Lest ought too careless should escape my tongue, When I'm not heard? STRENI. Forgive me, my VICTORIA. You see how grievously I am provoked. Anger forgets good manners; pardon me: I now am calm, I am myself again. Speak what thou wilt, as unrestrained as ever. VICTORIA. I shall offend. STRENI. Fear not. If thou hast ought That burns within here, boldly give it vent. I am not yet I hope so peevish grown As to take fire at any friendly freedom. I know thou meanst us well. VICTORIA. Heaven knows I do. STRENI. Then freely speak thy mind. VICTORIA. Well then, my Lord, Since I have leave to speak, and may be heard; This marriageâmust it be? STRENI. It must, VICTORIA. VICTORIA. In earnest? STRENI. Surely. VICTORIA. Then I'm sorry for it. And, STRENI, tho' to contradict your wisdom May misbecome my sex, still more my years; Yet in OLYMPIA's cause I will be plain, And right or wrong declare my inmost thoughts. Two sisters bore us; but I love OLYMPIA More for her sweet and generous qualities Than all these ties of blood. At your command I come to see the nuptial rites performed: But if her mind is so averse, I'd rather Weep at her funeral, tho' my heart should break. STRENI. You cannot think I love my daughter less Than you, VICTORIA; or less know her interest. What other motive than paternal love Could make me urge this marriage? VICTORIA. Urge a marriage! That rigid tie which death alone dissolves! That bold decisive step, which fixes us In happiness or misery for ever! That state which is a lottery at the best, But ventured on with coyness and reluctance Has little chance to prosper! All things else To this are trifles, and not worth disputing. Prevent a giddy marriage when you can; But never urge the wisest. STRENI. How you dictate! But I have told more years than you, have seen A little more of life too; and 'tis hard If old experience has not taught me something. 'Tis strange if passion, prejudice, and youth Decide more soundly than deliberate reason, That sees the objects in dispute divested Of false lights and infatuating fogs. Pray, of two judges qualified so differently, Which is the likeliest to determine right? VICTORIA. Doubtless, my Lord, the judge who sits serene Above all mists of passion. But where is he? Youth has its follies: and when these decline, A passion springs, they say, that blinds the soul As much as that gay dotage Love itself. A certain flower of winter!âFy upon it!â They call itâAvarice. STRENI. You're a saucy girl, And always was so: that pretty head of thine Has too much pertness in it. VICTORIA. Pardon me, My Lord; but either now, or henceforth never Can I with any grace or decency Claim those bold licences your goodness used T' indulge me in. Suppose you now at play With a Piedmontese sharper; one that had broke An hundred banks; a dextrous knave that cheats you At every throw: and I a looker on. Should it offend you, if by a wink or hem, Or pinching of your arm, I gave you hints Of this accomplish'd villain? My Lord, my Lord, This common cheat, this hankering after more, Betrays the wisest to strange weaknesses. How else could this e'er happen? STRENI's daughter, Rich STRENI's only child, has made (and not Without her father's warrant too) a fair Exchange of hardly-violable vows, with A youth whose qualities and accomplishments Equal his noble birth. Heaven! what should hinder Such lovers to be happy?âA richer man, Better allied, of finer dispositions Or parts, I dare not sayâbut surely older, Steps in; and STRENI, never famed for blundering. The soundest judge of other men's proceedings, Prefers his suit; th' indulgent father grows A tyrant, where he least should use his power. It is so strange, I shall believe in witchcraft! 'Tis plain infatuation! STRENI. Surely older! Ay, there's the crime no merit can attone for. Better be rash, hot-headed, passion's slave; Better be mad, and young; than old with all Th' advantages that can consist with years. Yet CLAUDIO's not so very old. VICTORIA. No, not Much turned of fifty. STRENI. Be it as you will; He is for pleasing manners, even for person, A more engaging man than fifty such As those whom youth and folly recommend To ruin half your sex. VICTORIA. You think him so, my Lord. But does OLYMPIA think so? that's material. Taste is so various, what engages one Disgusts another: and 'tis vain to dictate To this despotic principle of nature. Yet, if it must be so, you should prescribe Where I shall live, and how; what I shall wear; Even what companions shall engross my time For days, for weeks, for months; tho' this might prove A cruel trespass on my native freedom; But let my friend for life, my fortune's lord, On whom depends my bliss or misery, Be of my own approving: here at least, In this one instance may my choice be free. I have seen the Count, andâ STRENI. Well, what think you of him? VICTORIA. My Lord, I must not touch irreverently A character that boasts your good opinion: I dare not tamper with such sacred things. Befides I'm but a woman, and a young one; And to be critical in ought but dress Or dancing would not suit me. But, if you please, I'll tell you what some, who pretend to judge And think they know him, say. STRENI. Well, what? Come on. What do they say, good cousin? VICTORIA. First, they praise His person; which they say is, for his years, Specious enough; tall, jovial, sleek and blooming, As if 'twere May still. Nor is his mind, they say, Less youthful; for he's charmingly facetious;â As far as mere corporeal jollity Is wit and humour; but it seems no further. For tho' he has laughed incessantly these forty years, 'Tis strange, he has never blundered out one joke! For his parts they say but little: that may be envy. And yet they own that, from sagacious selfishness, And want of heart, he has cunning and deceit Enough t' outwit ten cardinals; for beneath An open, frank, unguarded-like behaviour, A shew of smooth and dimpling innocence, It seems he hides a quicksand: and they say He has earned his wealth as boldly as consists With honest policy, and a just regard For his own precious head. STRENI. A bold free hand To sketch a character out! The only thing That's wanting here is likeness. VICTORIA. Nay, my Lord, I only tell you what report says of him; If that belies him 'tis no fault of mine. I have heard indeed, that his manner, from facetious, Is grown of late embarrass'd and half sad: That he looks pensive, talks to himself, and when He laughs, it seems an effort to disguise Some secret grief; which looks mysteriously To those who mark him. But the cause is plain: 'Tis love, 'tis foolish love, makes him so grave.â A hopeful youth to grow love-pensive!âLord! I long to see him languish! It must be charming To see him languish for a Lady's fortune! STRENI. Fortune! What's that to him, whose ample means, Raised by his gallant service in the war, From the sad ruins of an ancient seat, Vie with the Princes of proud Italy? What can a moderate portion add to him So opulent, and yet without an heir? If fortune were his aim he could have choice Of richer matches; but he loves OLYMPIA; He best deserves her; and she shall be his, Or else no child of mine. Besides, this spark, This youth you so much boast of, by report Ere now has found another bride. VICTORIA. Be that As it may happen. But, alas! my Lord, Must all the joys and comforts of her life Be fondly sacrificed to this ambition, None of her own besides, to give an heir To?were it the first house in Italy? But if there be such charms in possibly Bringing a boy, who possibly may live T' inherit a great fortune, wear high titles, And yet perhaps be neither great nor happy; OLYMPIA, blest with every grace of nature, With fortune's bounties, and your daughter too, So young, may wait till other matches offer More to her mind, perhaps as much to yours. Nineteen is surely not a desperate age; 'Tis even too young to be unplum'd into That tame domestic creature called a Wife, And quit the careless pleasures of the world. Nay, 'tis not decent at these years to grow A sober matron. STRENI. How thou ramblest on!â But I am old, my child; I have not long To live, not many years; and 'tis my wish, My favourite aim, before I die, to see My daughter settled in a solid state Of happiness. That done, my rest of life Becomes a holiday, that chearful calm Which age delights in: and I shall? SCENE III. STRENI, VICTORIA, a Servant. SERVANT. My Lord, There's one just now arrived with some dispatches He has rode all night to bring you. STRENI. I'll see him presently. Go tell OLYMPIA that this Lady here Expects her company. SCENE IV. STRENI, VICTORIA. STRENI. My dear VICTORIA, I'll leave you to your cousin's entertainment A little while. VICTORIA. I'll go myself and find her. SCENE V. VICTORIA. Who could believe this good old man, so easy So gentle otherways, should in this case Prove so inflexible! But here comes OLYMPIA.â Alas, how altered!â SCENE VI. VICTORIA, OLYMPIA. VICTORIA. Ah, my dearest cousin!â Come, we're alone. OLYMPIA. Welcome to my sad heart!â What need have I of such a cordial sight! VICTORIA. Poor dear OLYMPIA!âHow catching are thy tears!â Thy griefs are mine. Would I could bear them for thee! OLYMPIA. How I have long'd to see my only friend, My kind companion!âNow she comes too late; For I'm undone for ever! VICTORIA. It must not be: All is not lost yet.âBless me! thy hands burn mineâ Thou art not well. OLYMPIA. Ah! did you know, VICTORIA, What I have suffered since we parted last, You'd wonder that this mortal frame so long Could bear such misery. VICTORIA. Come, dry thy tears. The worst is past.âYour father will relent: He needs must yield at last. OLYMPIA. Oh! never, never!â To-morrow, for ought that yet appears, compleats My wretchedness. VICTORIA. Good Heaven! it must not be. What! be engaged by force in vows so solemn! 'Tis madness to suppose it. OLYMPIA. Either it must be so, Or I must live an out-cast in the world, With all my father's curses on my head.â That's my hard sentence. VICTORIA. Never till this moment Have I once dreamt what happiness it was To own a little fortune uncontroll'd By any human caprice.â'Tis thine, OLYMPIA!â Heavens! We shall be the happiest two that live!â I say 'tis thine! OLYMPIA. My generous kind VICTORIA! But can I bear my father's fix'd displeasure?â Tho' to my daily grief I have found of late His tenderness estrang'd, I am not yet So harden'd with unkindness to endure To lose his smiles for ever. VICTORIA. That fear is vain. Your father is not of so stern a make. He cannot tear you from his heart; in him Nature defies it: this severity Is but put on, and costs him many a pang, No doubt, to urge you to what he conceives Your greatest happiness.âBut I long, OLYMPIA, To hear the whole of thy disastrous tale. For this long absence of two years, while all Intelligence has been shut up between us, Has kept me still in painful ignorance Of what has past. The general part indeed I know too well; but for particulars All I have learnt is merely from report; Whose specious lies discredit every truth It chances to throw out. I left you blest In the gay spring of love. A view more charming Of all that's sweet in th' harmony of souls Was never seen: your father too then seemed To hold ALPHONSO as his own; as one Soon to become his son-in-law. OLYMPIA. 'Tis true: And till my father had disclosed his mind, To give a sanction to ALPHONSO's vows; Whatever tenderness possess'd my soul, I let it fondly prey upon itself; My eyes ne'er told it, and much less my tongue. I hid my conscious blushes as I could, My fault'ring speech was virgin bashfulness, And if I trembled 'twas alarm, not love. Oh! I could burst, and on thy friendly bosom Breathe out my soul, VICTORIA, to remember The dear enchantments of those happy days! It was a sweet disease, a charming dream, And but a dream, of happiness. At last We were contracted by the mutual will Of both our parents; and a distant day Fix'd for the nuptials; when, alas!â VICTORIA. I know This CLAUDIO saw you; this rich Count: would he And all his millions in a mine had been Blown to the Moon, that luckless hour he came Blundering to blast such hopeful buds of joy! How I could curse him!âBut my dear OLYMPIA, I interrupt your story. OLYMPIA. Alas! my father, Dazzled with CLAUDIO's wealth, and by his arts Of most immoderate shameless flattery won, Grew cold to poor ALPHONSO; by degrees Chang'd his familiar cordial entertainment To dry civility, and shocking ceremony: Seized every opportunity to lessen him In my affections, and to recommend A stranger to my breast. 'Twas all in vain. How could I hear him? Was it possible To shift the pure devotion of my heart From lov'd ALPHONSO to a golden idol? Nay, to th' old object of ALPHONSO's hate?â I own I ne'er attempted it. But from That adverse time the fortune of our loves Has still declined; and (strange fatality!) Soon after this another cross event Confirm'd the former.â VICTORIA. How? OLYMPIA. One night at court, In the full splendor of a birth-day crowd, A vain pert fool, a minion of the King's, A coxcomb drunk with favour, snatch'd my hand And rudely kiss'd it; such confusion seiz'd me I had almost sunk: ALPHONSO, who was by, Forgetful of the reverence of the place And the King's presence, with one desperate blow Laid the plum'd courtier sprawling on the floor: And for that hasty generous fault was banished From Naples to Palermo, for a twelvemonth. VICTORIA. Banish'd! Heaven's patience! Had he failed to do it He had merited eternal banishment; From Naples, Italy, from every land, From all society where honour's thought of. Had I been King th' ill-manner'd fool who gave The first offence, and brought the other on, (Which was at worst a noble rashness) should Have bore the punishment alone. OLYMPIA. The King, On due submissions offered by ALPHONSO, 'Tis thought would freely have revoked the sentence, But for the secret practices of some Who wish'd his absence. Those dark dealings made All intercession vain; tho' for my sake He sloop'd to more than otherways, I know, His generous pride would have consented to.â No remedy: he must depart, and leave me A widowed bride; tho' first he press'd the nuptials, He claimed my hand: that was denied; my father Found some prudential reasons to excuse it Till his return. ALPHONSO warmly urged A private marriage: this my filial duty Forbade; tho' else, with all my soul, I would Have been the partner of his banishment, Not to Palermo, but to any desart, To Nature's wildest solitudes; I owed it, Could ought be dismal where ALPHONSO was, To him who owed his banishment to me. It was a mournful parting: one sad year Appeared an age; and till that age expired Our only view of consolation was Such intercourse as separates from the dead Our absent friends.âBut since that cruel day Not one short letterâ VICTORIA. How? That's strange, OLYMPIA! OLYMPIA. 'Tis no such wonder. For this generous exile, The hardly-used ALPHONSO, scarce had left The gates of Naples, when my father hurried me Down to these ancient melancholy walls, Remote from Naples and all neighbourhood. The real aim of this retreat, as from Th' event appears too plain, was to cut off All correspondence with ALPHONSO, and those That might promote intelligence between us; While this insidious rival should be favoured With all advantages to undermine My absent love. For ever since I have known This sad retirement, this confinement rather, My correspondence has been strictly watched Like one in gaol for treason. No company This twelvemonth have I seen but ALPHONSO, And those who with his odious praises chafe My persecuted ears. I have been afraid Of every morning's light; for every day Has seen me flattered, threatened, and cajoled, Tortured and teized, to what I most abhor. What's worse than these, strange fancies haunt my mind, And jealous cares pursue me, that my breast Pants with perpetual terrors and alarms. My health in sickly languor pines away: Kind sleep forsakes me; and when harrass'd Nature Sinks in imperfect rest, distracted dreams, Worse than my waking miseries, shake me from My frighted slumbers. Gracious Heaven defend me! 'Tis horrible to think how near the verge Of madness I have been. VICTORIA. Alas, OLYMPIA! What blasts have shook thy gentle soul! But Heaven And thine own fortitude will still support thee To baffle all their rage. OLYMPIA. My fortitude! Alas! my little share of that, VICTORIA, Has failed me already; fatally has failed me. For tired with endless teizing, glad to gain Some respite from the present pain, at last I promised in the weakness of my mind, That if within three days beyond the term In which ALPHONSO's banishment expir'd, He did not claim my plighted faith, I should Resign my hand to CLAUDIO. This I thought Was no great venture. For tho' no letters came, I hoped I knew the cause; nor would I doubt ALPHONSO's faith, and purpose not to lose One day of liberty in absence from me; These I remember were his words at parting, But, ah VICTORIA! would that doleful year Was yet not ended, that I still might hope! VICTORIA. Is it then past? OLYMPIA. Two days since: and to-morrow Decides my destiny. VICTORIA. But is there ought In this, that at his father's instigation ALPHONSO has commenced a nuptial treaty With a Sicilian Lady? OLYMPIA. Such a rumour Has, since that promise was extorted from me, Been so industriously rung in my ears, And managed with such arts and aggravations, It seemed, when the first shock was past, a fiction Contriv'd to shake my faith, and drive me in A hurry of resentment to my ruin. But by your looks you seem to apprehend 'Tis something moreâPerhaps you've heard he's married. For Heaven's sake do not flatter me, VICTORIA. If it is so tell me.âAh! VICTORIA. Nay, dear OLYMPIA, I tell you all I have heard; and that perhaps Comes from the secret fountain-head of lies. At least if such a treaty was confirmed You might expect the earliest notice of it. My life for't your intelligence in that Would pass without much barr or scrutiny. OLYMPIA. That's all my little comfort. But alas! I know not what to think of this delay. Sometimes my melancholy whispers me He has forgot or hates me, and in revenge of My father's slights has left me. At other times That probity, that unaffected warmth Of love unchanged by shocking injuries; Those generous manners, th' inviolable honour Which even his enemies admit, assure me He cannot be so base to quit me thus, Without some form at least of taking leave. Perhaps he has heard I'm married, and believes it; Perhaps he is not well.âI'm all perplexity. This agony of suspence is perfect torture, From which, to know that fate had done its worst Would be a kind of desperate repose.â Should he prove faithless, I have done, VICTORIA, What you'll despise me for. VICTORIA. It cannot be. You ne'er can stoop to ought that's really mean: But what, dear cousin? OLYMPIA. As the time approach'd Which was to prove decisive of my fortune, My fears encreased; my anxious throbbings grew Quite insupportable; my fluttering breast Could find no quiet. My restless brain at work How to prevent the worst, at last I found A trusty messenger to bear with speed A letter to ALPHONSO; which explained Whate'er was needful of my sufferings past And fears of worse to come; and that if still He loved and meant to claim me, the least delay Might render that impossible. Ere this I might have had some answer; but no news Arriving, in despair last night I sought Protection in a monastry that stands Amongst the neighbouring mountains: there I past The anxious night; but thither traced, this morning I was demanded by th' authority of My father in his vassals. VICTORIA. But the sisters, The Abbess, Heaven! how could they yield you up So tamely?âtheir protection! OLYMPIA. Do not blame them; They did their utmost for me. I was received With manners most respectfully obliging, With tears of sympathy, and fluttering care To hide me panting from the hot pursuit. But as my sheltering place was soon discovered, 'Twas more it seems than they could answer for, To brave my father's summons.âYou see, VICTORIA, How every refuge fails me. A short time now Remains for me to hope. Yet something still, Whether the whisperings of some friendly power, Or the last effort of tenacious hope, Suggests to my sore mind that ere to-morrow ALPHONSO will be here. But come what will I shall not marry CLAUDIO; that's determined.â I know one refuge from all miseryâ One cordial draught shallâ VICTORIA. What?âThy words are frightful!â Heaven banish all such thoughts!âAlas! OLYMPIA, Thou lookst thro' the false glass of Melancholy. Trust me there's nothing yet so desperate here. Whate'er may happen lucklessly, the worst Is still avoidable.âYou shall be sickâ Or take another flight.âWe'll fly together. I will secure you in a little fortress Which to the General himself in person Shall scarce surrender you at the first summons. There are a thousand shifts; more than we yet Can think of.âBut the time is precious: Come let us hide ourselves, and plot together. 'Twill be a charming triumph, if we two, In half a day, at one unlooked-for blow, Can dreadful schemes demolish, which to rear Has cost much older heads a restless year. ACT II. SCENE I. STRENI. What's to be done? Good God! these news confound me! I cannot yet believe my eyes. Let me read This letter again.âThere's nothing in the world But villainy and delusion: knaves and dupes Maintain this foolish farce of human life.â Let me seeâ âI am this moment in formed that Count CLAUDIO is accused of some embezzlements and other perfidious practices during the late war, which render him obnoxious to the State; and that warrants are actually issued out to apprehend him. I am sorry this piece of news did not reach me till after my sister VICTORIA's departure; but hope it will not come too late to prevent your engaging in so fatal an alliance. At least, whether my information prove true or false, I thought myself obliged to give you this notice.ââ Well, this cuts deep indeed! There all my hopes My flattering schemes lie blasted and o'erthrown. The shock so stuns me that I yet scarce feel it. Is it so then, CLAUDIO? Well, I find at last This world is all a cheat, and there's no trusting To fair appearances.âWould this had happened A twelvemonth sooner! what an anxious year It would have saved me and my poor OLYMPIA! Yet better now than a twelvemonth hence;ânay, than To-morrow.âBless me! how nearly have we 'scaped The crush of this man's ruin!âIt grieves my soul When I look back on what my child has suffered, And all for nothing. But, Heaven knows! whate'er Was harshly managed was still kindly meant. I long to lighten of a deadly weight Her labouring breast, that flutters now with fear T' approach me, and retards her trembling steps. Could she but guess the purpose of my message She'd make more haste to meet me.âBut she comes. SCENE II. STRENI, OLYMPIA. OLYMPIA. I am ashamed to see my father's face: But prostrate thus and breathless at his feet I beg forgiveness. STRENI. Rise, OLYMPIA. Come, Indeed it was not well. OLYMPIA. 'Twas my despair That did it.âPardon me, my Lordâmy father! STRENI. I do, my child, I do. You've never found me An unrelenting parent: or if ever I have given way to some austerities, My very tenderness provoked me to them, My eager care to see you happy. OLYMPIA. My father, You have been ever gracious, kind and tender; Your goodness still prevented all my wishes: And it has cost me many a painful throb To be reduced, by thwarting obligations, To act a stubborn part against your pleasure. I know your purpose is to make me happy: But what's all splendor and superfluous wealth, What's all the world, to dear content of mind?â My heart is not at my command: and yet So far I could controul it, that was there one Dear as my soulâI never would, without My father's sanction, change my vows with his: There is but one thing you can urge and I Not chearfully yield to. Were your sacred life To be redeemed with mine, oh! I should fall A willing victim: nothing there could combat My filial duty. But to give the hand To one while to another the heart's engaged, Is something so prophane, it looks so like Base prostitution, that the more I think on't The more it shocks me.âStill my honoured father, Let me implore your graceâ'Tis not too late To save me from this violation. STRENI. My child, I will no longer to thy delicacy Oppose the steadiest purpose of my soul. Indeed I'm sorry to have urged so far A match that shocks thee. To-morrow is the day Thou dreadst so much: but I would rather make The greatest power on earth my deadly foe Than thee unhappy. OLYMPIA. O my gracious father! Tears so o'erpower me that they choak my wordsâ But on my knees I thank you.âYou're too good! STRENI. Come to my heart, my child: thou never wast A stranger there, nor ever can'st thou be While it has vital warmth. OLYMPIA. My dearest father, This kindness makes at once a full amends For all the griefs that I have ever known.â I am too happyâ A SERVANT. The Count, my Lord, Is at the gates. STRENI. The Count!âwhat CLAUDIO?âwellâ Conduct him in.âHe comes betimes;âbefore He was expected.âButâwhat ails my childâ Thou tremblest and growst pale!âRetire my childâ My poor OLYMPIA!âWell, 'tis plain enough What all this hurry means. But soft and fair Good Count! you come no further this way, Count. Not one step further. You little knowâ SCENE III. STRENI, CLAUDIO. CLAUDIO. Good morrow, And many happy days, to good Lord CLAUDIO? STRENI. The same to you, Count CLAUDIO.âWho'd believe it! CLAUDIO. You cannot wonder that I thus prevent My happiest day: my love of dear OLYMPIA, My warm ambition to be stiled your son, Might well account for that.âBut I have news,â No bad ones neither.âGuess, my Lord. STRENI. How should I?â What mean you? CLAUDIO. Only this;âat last 'tis done What we so long have labouredâALPHONSO's married! 'Tis trueâ'tis past all doubtâI have sure proofs on't. And now OLYMPIA stands absolved from all Engagements there, which gives me double joy: For it would damp all happiness to shock Her scrupulous honour; and indeed that thought Has always check'd meâWhat! you're sad, my Lord, STRENI. I have some reason. I am quite heart-sick Of ineffectual cares. I've done whate'er Authority or gentle arts could do To push this backward treaty, but find at last 'Tis all in vain. 'Twill never do, believe me. CLAUDIO. How's this, my worthy Lord? you quite amaze me! I thought it had been fix'd. STRENI. It seem'd so; but I cannot force my daughter's inclinations. CLAUDIO. I hope they are not now less kind to me Than when the happy day was named. STRENI. Indeed, Not to amuse you with false complaisance, I think they rather are; for as the day Draws nearer her reluctance grows more violent. I cannot bear to see her agonies. Could I compel her, as indeed I cannot, I feel too much compunction in my breast To use a power so tyrannous and unjust Against my child. Nor would it suit your wisdom To yoke your years with an unwilling bride. And as your friend, my Lord, I would dissuade you From further thoughts of this: extorted vows Can never tend to happiness. CLAUDIO. I hope I do but dream! If not, your mind, my Lord, Is strangely altered for the time. These difficulties Till now have ne'er been thought of. But they're nothing: For be affection e'er so coy, 'twill grow At last with tender cherishing. STRENI. But its growth Will not be forced. Let time and nature work. Have patience. Let it rest. A short delay Can breed no danger here. A month or two hence Will do as well, or better. CLAUDIO. A month or two! Heavens! that's an age to one who loves like me!â No, no,âto-morrowâwould it were to-day! STRENI. It cannot be to-dayânor yet to-morrow. CLAUDIO. How! not to-morrow? Ah! by all that's tender Let me insist on that, my dearest Lord. STRENI. Urge me no further. CLAUDIO. For your own sake, my Lord, As well as mine, I must.âHow will it sound? 'Tis knownâ STRENI. Suppose ALPHONSO had returned? You know the termsâ CLAUDIO. He's married. STRENI. I'm sorry for it. CLAUDIO. You joke. STRENI. Not I. I'm not so merry. CLAUDIO. Sorry! STRENI. Yes, I say sorry. CLAUDIO. Why? STRENI. My daughter loved him.â And he's an honest man. CLAUDIO. There are many such I hope, my Lord. STRENI. Yes, hundreds who appear such To one that is. CLAUDIO. Good Heaven! What can this mean?â But some men's favour is a slippery hold. Not long ago ALPHONSO was dismiss'd To make me room; now 'tis my turn to yield To some new favourite. I see it plainly. STRENI. I shall not henceforth be too rash in making New friendships;âthat I promise you. CLAUDIO. My Lord, You aim at something; what I know not: but To one who almost lived upon your smiles, That angry coyness in your look is death; And every word you utter is so keen It stings me to the heart. I could encounter The rudest malice of indifferent men With vengeance or contempt. But from the man I love, and on whose love I built my happiness, Unkindness tortures while it wounds.âHow have I Deserved this? sure some secret foe of mine Has been too busy with your ear: for foes I have, more than I know of. What little services I've done my country are by some repaid With Envy: but I laugh at that, my Lord. To one that's fortified in innocence Such bolts are harmless: 'Tis as 'twere to batter A fort with snow-balls. Yet it would be kind, Nay 'tis but justice, if malicious tongues Have tampered with my name, to let me know Of what I stand accused. STRENI. You talk like one Unconscious of all blame: but boldness is not Always the surest test of innocence. CLAUDIO. What have I done? STRENI. Look backwards, and consider. Peruse your life a little. CLAUDIO. There's nothing there I dare not boldly look into. But what, My Lord, does all this tend to? STRENI. Have you nothing To settle with the state?â CLAUDIO. To settle!âyesâ The state is in my debt. STRENI. But has the state No claim on you? CLAUDIO. For nothing but my services Whene'er it needs them. STRENI. Are you sure of that? CLAUDIO. As sure as that I live. STRENI. All-conscious Heaven! Was ever such effrontery known!âD'ye think We've no intelligence here? Or can you be So ignorant of the dreadful storm that hangs Ready to burst upon your head? is 't possible You should not know how dear a reckoning, what A bloody one perhaps, you have to pay? For what, you best should guess.âInfatuate man! Away!âThere is no safety here!âFly quickly!â There is no ground where Naples has command Can shelter you!âYou're mad to stay one moment!â The blood-hounds of the state are at your heels!â Away, and hide yourself betimes! CLAUDIO. Ha! ha! STRENI. You laugh!â(He's surely mad!) CLAUDIO. Indeed I do, To see the bottom of this fearful mystery. 'Tis well no wounded conscience watches here To cry out Guilty when another's crimes Burst out. There's here a small mistake, my Lord; Only one CLAUDIO for another; that's all.â Ha! ha! STRENI. What other CLAUDIO? CLAUDIO. You have seen him. A distant kinsman of my own, and tho' He has hurt me in the tenderest point I pity him. 'Twas I that raised him to a place of trust, Because I thought him honest; and, for some time, So blind is friendship, I neglected all Reports to his discredit, as the blasts Of envy; till at last some flagrant acts Appeared.âI never was so angry; never Perhaps but then have I rebuked with rancour. Yet on his promise to offend no more He was continued. But it seems th' effect Of all my friendly warnings, all my threats, And weak mistaken lenity at last, Was only this, to put him on his guard, And make him a more politick knave. But now He is in hands will strip him of his spoils, And squeeze the inmost marrow from his bones. For, if 'tis true what I have heard, by this He's prisoner to the state. STRENI. (What shall I think?)â This is a strange mistake; and if indeed It be no more, I'm glad on't for the sake Of one I am so loath to judge of harshly. But on your honour, pardon me good Count, Is there no more than this? CLAUDIO. D'ye doubt my word?â What should I gain by such a falshood?âI Who see no luxury in simple lying? Were I th' obnoxious wretch you take me for My mind had hardly been employed to-day In nuptial thoughts; nor should my presence here Have shock'd good CLAUDIO? Look upon my face; Is there ought there or in my whole behaviour That shews like guilt? Heavens! can I be so monstrous So madly wicked, so absurd a villain, For such I must be, to involve my friends, Those whom I love most, one whom I adore, In my perdition?âBut if you doubt me still, With all my heart here let us stop, my Lord, Till every straw suspicion stumbles at Be swept away. Inform yourself; be cautious; Do nothing rashly. And, my Lord, to shew you How dearly I regard your satisfaction: Let us, that you may weigh it at full leisure, Adjourn this marriage; not for a month or two, But for a year or two, or three, or seven,â Or, if you please, for ever. Heaven forbid I should engage you in my bankruptcy!â Good God defend me!âSo, farewel, my Lordâ My servants thereâ STRENI. Come; not so hot, my Count. A word or two before you go. Let's part Like friends at least. CLAUDIO. Where friendship is so ticklish The sooner done the better. I'm heart-sick Of hot and cold friends: They never quit the pains It costs to manage them. Farewel! STRENI. Yet hear me.â I'm sorry, CLAUDIO; I am quite confounded For this mistake. But the report was aimed At you so very plainly, that your brother Must have believed it. 'Tis not in my nature, Old as I am, to be suspicious. But where the welfare of my only child, Her happiness for life depends, to scruple Is no offence I hope; at least I'm sure meant you none. In proof of which, demand My utmost power to serve you. CLAUDIO. Ah STRENI! STRENI! You know me but too well. I am a child To you; mere wax, you mould me at your pleasure: You wound and heal me. Were I less your slave, And less enamoured, this unkind behaviour Had rid me of those chains which I prefer To freedomâlove and friendship. STRENI. Come, forgive An old man's spleen; forget it. And to prove How little apt I am to keep impressions To CLAUDIO's disadvantage; every art I have, and all my power, shall be employed To hasten on these nuptials.âBut is it certain, This marriage of ALPHONSO? make that appear, And the main obstacle's removed. CLAUDIO. Last night I met a gentleman, you know him; STURIO; You have seen him with ALPHONSO: he comes on business Post-haste from Sicily. The night before He left Palermo was, he says, the eve of ALPHONSO's wedding, which his haste alone Excused him from attending. 'Tis like he brings Some message hither; for he said, this morning He should be here. I thought to have found him here Before me; but he'll soon appear, I doubt not, And certify his news. STRENI. Well, let him come. He comes with no intelligence to retard Our purpose.âShall I leave you, ALPHONSO, here Till I prepare OLYMPIA for such news As rashly told might hurt her? CLAUDIO. By all means. STRENI. You'll follow presently? CLAUDIO. I will, my Lord. SCENE IV. CLAUDIO. What am I doing? 'Tis almost a crime To work on this good man's credulity thus. But the great principle which rules us all, The care that quits us not even in despair, Is love of self.âSelf-preservation never Can be unjust. If this succeed, his credit And interest with the state may clear me. Nothing, Nothing but that can do it. But we must Dispatch: this crazy fabric of my fortune Totters at every step of stealing time.â But then to be reproached and baited for Dissimulation!âWho can prove that?âNone. Was I obliged to know what secret trains Were laid to blow my envied grandeur up?â Not I. There's something too in STRENI's carriage To justify a little double dealing. He has not used me quite ingenuously; And far from kindly. Interest is his God, As well as that of otherâhonest men. So far all's fair, we're on an equal footing.â Wellâ This is the most convenient cousin!âALPHONSO, I thank you for this seasonable help. Would I could serve you in my turn! But that's Too late; your doom is certain: mine comes next To be determined; to my loss or not I dare not guess.âBut flourish I or fall, 'Tis still some satisfaction to have crush'd The eager hopes of this impetuous youth. Dupe of fair words, and smiles, and shrugs, ALPHONSO, You have forgot, I do believe, but I Shall still remember, with what haughtiness You faced me when a younger Officer O'erstrode you once. Was I to blame? He knew The art of speaking to the palm; and was A docile boy, as stupid as you please, And not too apt to rouse much jealousy. These are the men best fitted for promotion In every rank of life.âBut now to OLYMPIA. Now help me Flattery!âFlattery! She deserves All praise; such excellence could not find its match in The men of this age: yet she must be mine; And soon, or never. Hence then all delay; My fate depends on this important day. ACT III. SCENE I. OLYMPIA, VICTORIA. VICTORIA. Come, cousin, you may breathe here freely; come, There floats no fulsome incense here. You need Fresh air; a tempest were almost too little To fan this musky cloud of flattery off. Foh! Such a stench of perfume suffocates worse Than a volcano's mouth. Heaven! what a tongue! I do believe the Devil inspires him. Bless me! With what a face of plain sincerity, With what a serious confidence, he throws out The most extravagant flatteries! How they work On your hard heart I know not: but for me, I feel so tickled with my share, God knows, I shall not sleep these three nights. OLYMPIA. Ah VICTORIA! Was ever one so wretched? VICTORIA. To be teized thus Indeed is most vexatious. But an hour, 'Tis hardly more, since from the middle gloom of A long tempestuous night, a sudden blaze Like noon burst out, almost with shocking brightness. It smiled a while, enchantingly it smiled, And promised balmy climes and happy shores: Then, like a dream of th' air, this gaudy meteor, This phantom of a sun, dissolved itself Into the waste of darkness. OLYMPIA. Ah me! VICTORIA! What shall I do? VICTORIA. Be firm, and never yield. You're in the right, and cannot be too obstinate, Be constant still; a little struggling more Will end this strife. OLYMPIA. Alas! alas! all's over. VICTORIA. All's over! How my dear? I say keep firm. Why this despondence? recollect yourself. Have you, good Heaven! forgot your father's promise, So lately made? his unexpected promise, So voluntarily made? Insist on that. Never forsake yourself, my dear OLYMPIA. Abide inflexibly by that. OLYMPIA. Alas! You come not near my grief. VICTORIA. I guess it. But There's something yet more shocking than the loss of A faithless lover. What you may avoid; And will I hope. OLYMPIA. Sure you have never loved. VICTORIA. My dear OLYMPIA, would you have me whine? And with an ill-timed sympathy indulge A mind already too much softened, when Th' occasion calls for fortitude and spirit? One effort moreâfear nothingâthe steady mind O'er-matches fate itself.â OLYMPIA. My fate approaches. Ah my VICTORIA!âYou heard the news? VICTORIA. I did. OLYMPIA. Do you believe it? May it not be false still? Tell me sincerely what you think. VICTORIA. 'Tis hard To judge; a little time will shew it. OLYMPIA. But May it not possibly enough be false? It comes from a suspicious hand. A falsehood Believ'd for e'er so short a time may speed A wicked purpose; and this art they say The cunning often practise.âBesides, this messenger Appears not yet; 'tis noon too.âAh VICTORIA! Is there not room to hope still? VICTORIA. Dear OLYMPIA! I would suppose the worst in doubtful cases. For better mortify a little needlesly, Than meet misfortune unprepared. OLYMPIA. Alas! I am my own impostor. Strange, that misery Should flatter thus itself! Why dare I not Resolve at once to look upon my fate? A SERVANT. Madam, a Gentleman, one Signor STURIO, Begs at your leisure to attend you. OLYMPIA. STURIO!â Well shew him inâSTURIO you said? Good Heaven! What shall I do, VICTORIA!âStayâI'm busy. Excuse me to him.âTell himâby and by I shall be glad to see him. When I ring You may conduct him hither. Ah VICTORIA! [Sitting down hastily.] What shall I do? I cannot see this man: [Rising.] This beating at the heart makes it impossibleâ I pant for breathâI shall not have the power To speak one word.âAh me! VICTORIA. Dearest OLYMPIA! Yield not to this alarm. Recover yourself. This flutter cannot last. OLYMPIA. Must I be seen In this confusion? It must not beâI will not. It is not fit I should.âPray might not you Receive this visit for me? Do, dear cousin. Say I am sick, or whimsical, or mad; Say any thing, and let me hide myself. VICTORIA. Stay, dear OLYMPIA. Come: it cannot be. You cannot now with honour to yourself Avoid this interview. Come, come, be firm. 'Twill soon be over. Were the case my own, I think I should with most contemptuous coolness Receive the last leave of a faithless man. What should you fear who know the worst already? Let indignation shake this tim'rous fit off; And shew yourself superior to the loss Of one not worth the keeping. Come, you can; I know, I'm sure, you can. OLYMPIA. I am ashamed Of this base weakness.âWell, what must be must be. [Rings.] Now, Heaven support me! VICTORIA. Never fear. The fit Goes off: and what alarms you now, my dearest, You will hereafter laugh at.âShall I leave you? OLYMPIA. No, stay.âHe comes.âAh! VICTORIA. Let him. He's more afraid Than you. SCENE II. OLYMPIA, VICTORIA, STURIO. STURIO. All happiness to Lady OLYMPIA. OLYMPIA. You're welcome, Sir, from Sicily.âPray sit, Sir. I'm glad to see you; you're a mighty stranger. We have not seen you I'm sure almost these two years. How like you Sicily, Sir? They say it is A most enchanting spot. STURIO. A Paradise, Madam. OLYMPIA. They say so. Pray what news there, Sir? I hope You left all friends well, andâamongst the rest How does your friend ALPHONSO? STURIO. Madam, I left him well. OLYMPIA. We're told he has altered his condition lately.â He's married?âIs he not?âThis Lady, Sir, My friend, may know whate'er belongs to me. He's married?â STURIO. Madamâ OLYMPIA. Well, I wish him joy With all my heart. I hope 'tis happily. The Ladyâyou have seen her? STURIO. Often, Madam. CASERTA's daughter: not a first-rate beauty, Nor yet quite homely. OLYMPIA. Well, I wish them happy With all my sonl.âNo other news, Sir? STURIO. None. But This letter, Madam, parting from ALPHONSO, I promised to deliver.âPardon me Th' abruptness of this hurry; business calls me: And what more time I have to spare at present Lord STRENI claims. Madam, may all that's good Ever attend you. OLYMPIA. I thank you, Sir. Farewell.â SCENE III. OLYMPIA, VICTORIA. OLYMPIA. Ah! ah! VICTORIA! [Throwing herself into a chair.] VICTORIA. Dear OLYMPIA, patience!â What shall I do?âWhen I should comfort her I weep myself.âMy dear OLYMPIA!â OLYMPIA. Ah me! VICTORIA. This desperate grief will kill her. OLYMPIA. Oh! Oh! Oh! VICTORIA. My dear OLYMPIA, let us not indulge This weakness of our spirit.âCome, my dearest, Come rouse yourself. OLYMPIA. Alas! alas! VICTORIA!â Do not despise me. VICTORIA. Nay, my dear, this weakness Has nothing shameful in it. As it shews A delicate mind, it is a beauty rather; And only grows a fault and a misfortune By too much yielding to it. OLYMPIA. Ah VICTORIA!â I am so humbled with repeated shocks That my tame spirit sinks beneath its wrongs.â But for this letterâI am blind with weepingâ Read it, VICTORIA. VICTORIA. Burn it. OLYMPIA. Read it first. VICTORIA. âMadam, in spite of all your neglects I have prevailed upon myself to write to you once more, that you may know I have temper enough to forgive them. I am not so selfish as to disapprove of your choice; it is perfectly prudent; for wealth you know is the great support of female pride: vanity I should say, for pride is too noble a name for it. I wish you joy of your Count; there is one noble quality attends himâhe is rich. But if he ever dares appear where I am, were he twenty times your husband, I shall take the liberty to put him in mind of some other qualities I have discovered in him. In the mean time I am so far from reproaching you with inconstancy, that I thank you for having shewn it before it could essentially hurt me. I am following your example, and shall forget all former attachments as fast as I can. It is what I owe in justice to myself, and to one of your sex who deserves all my love and esteem. Farewell, OLYMPIA! You are not what I thought you once. But may Heaven rain gold upon you! So prays the forgiving, tho' monstrously abused ALPHONSOâ OLYMPIA. What does he say? [Snatching the letter.] VICTORIA. Cousin, I give you joy Of this deliverance from one worthless man. OLYMPIA. What does he say?âAll my neglectsâthat's well. He has prevailed upon himselfâ'Tis much So great a spirit should condescend so far As to abuse me!âI have temper enoughâ Yes temper! surelyâTo forgive you, that's pleasantâ 'Tis pity you should have reason to forgive me. Your choice is perfectly prudentâFool! what choice? The only choice I ever made was a wrong one, And I'm ashamed of'tâthank Heaven I've missed it!â Choice!â What's this he talks Of wealthâof female pride, and vanity?â Such rambling stuff!âhe's mad! the man's distracted! You wish me joy. Heaven mend your crazy head! Did you ever hear the like? VICTORIA. 'Tis an original. OLYMPIA. But if he ever dares appear, &amp;c. How well he counterfeits anger, and plays the bully!â But here's a stroke worth all the restâI am so far From reproaching you with inconstancy, &amp;c. âBefore it could essentially hurt meâ What does he mean? There is no bearing this! Base foul-mouthed perjured traitor, have you the face Thus to abuse me, whose only fault to you Was too much constancy? I'm well repaid For all the griefs my foolish constancy Has cost me!âAm I not, VICTORIA? VICTORIA. Curse him! He is not worth your anger. OLYMPIA. I am following your exampleâ Good again!âand shall forgetâforget Me! by all means do. In justice to one Of your sex who deserves all my love and Esteemâ That she may do without deserving much.â You are not what I thought you onceâ No more are youâMay Heaven Rain all its plagues upon me, if you dwell A moment longer hereâThus, thus I tear The villain from my heart. 'Tis done at once.â There, thereâthou art no more. [Tearing the letter.] VICTORIA. Who talks of want Of spirit? How this haughtiness becomes thee! This indignation's charming. OLYMPIA. Well, I'm cured Of one great folly. How light my heart feels from A villainous guest that sat like lead upon it! My spirit mounts again. Believe me, cousin, I'm glad of this man's baseness; I enjoy it: There's luxury in it. I do not entertain A wish so tame as that he had proved unalterable. 'Tis better as it is. It feeds my spite Voluptuously to find him such a villain. I wish he knew how heartily I scorn him! How thoroughly I detest him!âHe shall know it. I'll make him feel it.â VICTORIA. Your absolute neglect, As if such things had never past, will gall him. 'Twill be the finest vengeance! Cool neglect, If there is pride in him, will humble him more Than fifty thousand spiteful offices. OLYMPIA. Oh! that mean letter! I could tear myself. I wish the palsy had seized this hand before It did me such disgrace. VICTORIA. My dear OLYMPIA, Ne'er let that hurt you. You did but what was honourable. Were it to do again you should.âIt leaves His baseness no excuse. OLYMPIA. Pray, when this message came, How did I look, VICTORIA? tell me plainly. Did I seem violently shocked? VICTORIA. By no means. OLYMPIA. Look'd I not flush'd and pale by turns? No signs Of wildness or disorder? VICTORIA. None that he could perceive. OLYMPIA. Did I not faulter in my speech a little? VICTORIA. Not more than I do now. OLYMPIA. Nor tremble? VICTORIA. No. Thou didst behave with so composed a grace, I could have hugg'd thee. OLYMPIA. Well, I'm glad of this. And now, VICTORIA, I shall shew this false one How slightly I regard him. I have the means To shew him instantly 'twas honour, more Than ill-directed love, that made me stand So long and close a siege; made me hold out To disobedience, almost to rebellion, Against my father's threats, his warm intreaties, Against his wiser choice. My honour now Absolved, I cannot be too passive to My filial duty. VICTORIA. What dost thou mean, OLYMPIA? OLYMPIA. To mortify a villain's insolence. VICTORIA. But how? OLYMPIA. By giving my rejected vows to The man he hates; whom for his sake I scorned; Whom now I love because I know he hates him. Yes, I will give his mortal foe my hand.â By heaven, I will! OLYMPIA. You will! indeed not you. OLYMPIA. Then, if I do not, may theâ SCENE IV. OLYMPIA, VICTORIA, STRENI. STRENI. Well, OLYMPIA. You cannot doubt it now? The truth appears At last. You see, what happens every day, The fickleness of youthful vows: despise it; The dignity of your sex demands it of you. Laugh at it. OLYMPIA. Nay, my Lord, I have forgot it. There is but one reflection stings me now. I have, against my nature, stubbornly Opposed my father's will, his just command. Most heartily I repent it; and I hope Your goodness will forgive a crime which honour Betrayed me to. My honour disengaged, I have no will but yours. STRENI. There spoke my daughter! My will, my pleasure is to see you happy. 'Tis that engrosses all my cares; for that Have I so steadily withstood your tears, And made the weakness of affection yield To rigid reason. Now th' auspicious hour Appears; and not to dally needlesly With time, what must be done to-morrow may As well be done to-day. Nay were it only For triumph's sake, to make as light of love As the most fickle boy, the sooner the better. This very dayâ OLYMPIA. This moment! VICTORIA. Hold, OLYMPIA! STRENI. Hold you, VICTORIA! VICTORIA. No: I will not hold. Shall I, my Lord, when hurried by despair My friend would plunge into the boiling deep, Look calmly on, and cry Well done; 'tis right; This world is not for you; destroy yourself; And do it bravely, as becomes your spirit?â But this is worse. Death ends all human woes: But this is launching a weak slender bark Into a sea of sorrows. STRENI. Pray, good madam, None of your rhetoric. VICTORIA. I affect not rhetoric. 'Tis truth. STRENI. 'Tis false. VICTORIA. My Lord, I should be grieved To see the trial hazarded.âOLYMPIA!â You're going in a sudden fit of spleen To throw yourself away. ALPHONSO has done it. But disagreeable ties sit not so heavy On his as on our sex. Yet he's unhappy: Self-ruined, blindly hurried to his fate. For he has married from mere pique, I'm positive; And loves you still. That angry letter shews it. OLYMPIA. Love me! Ne'er name him more: it shocks me. VICTORIA. Cousin, Is't possible a little passing gust Of spleen should drive you to devote your life To eternal discontent? To wed the man You cannot loveâwhom you despise?âGood Heaven! The moment that you cool you'll give the world To have the deed undone. STRENI. This is intolerable! VICTORIA, you're too busy, much too busy. Meddle not here, I charge you. Mind your own Affairs. VICTORIA. My friend's are mine. Pray, good my Lord, What interest of my own have I to meddle? 'Tis neither vanity nor love of brawls, I'm sure, that makes me busy. But is this A time for tame implicit complaisance? Can I sit still, and silently approve When those I love are bent on desperate deeds? Call me officious and impertinent, As many meddlers as you chuse, I care not. For be as angry as you please, at least I will discharge my mind. STRENI. You're mad, you're mad.â You're mad, I tell you. VICTORIA. 'T may be.âBut dear OLYMPIA. Why will you hurry on a change, at best So awful; here most certainly so fatal? OLYMPIA. It is my father's will. VICTORIA. Your father is Too good to exact obedience here, against Your inclination. 'Tis not very long since He told you so. STRENI. Good God! what must I bear? Is this exaction? Bless me! is it not Her own free choice?âPray, is it not, OLYMPIA? OLYMPIA. Alas! my father!â STRENI. What wouldst thou say? OLYMPIA. Forgive My wavering mind. I want not to retract My hasty promise. Only give me time, A little time, till old impressions die; That I may yield a more devoted heart, A heart more worthy of a good man's vows. STRENI. Heaven's curse on all romance! You've learnt, OLYMPIA, A delicacy foreign to this world. You will, in spite of plain good sense, refine Yourself into a fool. How many matches, And happy matches too, had ne'er been made Were all your sex as scrupulous as you are. But you're so fickle, now you say this moment, And now next year. OLYMPIA. Alas! it was my rashness. I hope my father will not urge against me What passion tortured from me. STRENI. Who can bear this? By Heaven I shall run mad!âTo have a daughter So obstinate against her father's will! Against her own good fortune!âGracious Heaven! Why did you curse me with a stubborn child? I have but one, and she'sâ VICTORIA. Dear good my Lord, Why all this heat? OLYMPIA knows her duty; And only begs a little timeâ STRENI. To shuffle. I'll have no more of that. I have too long Indulg'd her squeamish humour: but I will not Be longer trifled with in this, depend on't. And if she is my daughter; if I live, This day shall make her, what she ought to wish, Count CLAUDIO's wife: this very hour shall do it. By Heaven it shall. VICTORIA. But why to-day, my Lord? Why should it be so sudden? STRENI. 'Tis my pleasure, I'll have it so. Let me alone; I know sure What I am doing. VICTORIA. Yet hear me, good my Lordâ STRENI. No more! I would not have you waste your breath. 'Tis fix'd; and may I never taste of bliss If ought shall shake me. VICTORIA. O Heaven!â OLYMPIA. Cousin, forbear.â Pardon it father to my perverse fate That I've e'er combated your sacred will. 'Tis but in this I e'er could hesitate At one command of yours. You are determined; And were it to my ruin, I obey. I've nothing more to plead. STRENI. My dearest child, Not to thy ruin; Heaven forbid! I lead thee To honour, happiness, establish'd bliss. Thou soon shalt be the envy of thy sex, And I the happiest father Heaven e'er smiled on. Come; let us go, and seize the prosperous hour; No dallying now, while fortune's in our power. VICTORIA. Alas! alas! what fortune I foresee In this, is black, and ends in misery. ACT IV. SCENE I. ALPHONSO. Married! Then what a wretch art thou, ALPHONSO? Just married!âFates, I am your daily sport. Born to be wretched, all my life has been A train of strange mischances. Married! and to My most detested foe!âDeath! must this be? It shall not, were all hell in arms to guard This imp of treachery. My quick revenge Shall burst this fiend-tied most unnatural knot, And make all villains quakeâ A SERVANT. My Lady, Sir, The Countess will attend you. ALPHONSO. 'Tis well. I thank you.â The Countess! Vengeance! Oh I shall run mad!â My fluttering heart! She comes! I caught a glimpse That charms and tortures me. SCENE II. ALPHONSO, OLYMPIA. OLYMPIA. Who's this? defend me! What are you? ALPHONSO. Need I tell my name, OLYMPIA? OLYMPIA. I have no business with your name nor you. What brought me hither?â ALPHONSO. Stay, OLYMPIA, hear me.â OLYMPIA. I'm not at leisure.â ALPHONSO. But, we part not so. I will be heard. OLYMPIA. Presumptuous! are you mad? Let go my hand. ALPHONSO. 'Twas mineâtill fate and youâ OLYMPIA. Yours!âNever!â'Twas not fate but I that gave it, And my heart with it, to a man ten times Your worth. It was my voluntary deed. I gave it toâ ALPHONSO. A villain. OLYMPIA. Tell him so. ALPHONSO. I will; ne'er doubt it: what should hinder me? OLYMPIA. You will? I like your manners, to abuse My husband to my face. ALPHONSO. Your husband! plagues! A knave that should be married to the wheel.â And you to call him husband! OLYMPIA. I'm not used T' exchange high speeches with the mad. Go, leave me, And keep your head cool.âGood God! I cannot think What brought you here. How! leave your bride so soon!â I've had a lucky miss. ALPHONSO. Alas, OLYMPIA! How you mistake! OLYMPIA. In what? ALPHONSO. Both you and I Are monstrously abused; the meerest dupes That artful villainy and capricious fate Ever combined to laugh at. OLYMPIA. How? ALPHONSO. Good God! Can you imagine, were I so engaged As you conceive, I should so far depart From all propriety as this day to stun you With impertinent complaints? OLYMPIA. O Heaven! what mean you? ALPHONSO. While you remain thus ignorant of the truth, My conscious honour so forsakes me, that I deem myself the traitor you suppose me. But know, OLYMPIAâ OLYMPIA. What? ALPHONSO. There never was A heart more true to tenderness than mine. 'Twas your's, 'tis your's; you reign unrivaled there; You ever did, and ever shall: I scorn All other vows. OLYMPIA. Bless me! you rave indeed. This is strange talk for a new-married man! ALPHONSO. You will not understand me, dear OLYMPIAâ I am not married. OLYMPIA. Horrors! Did I hear you?â Not married! ALPHONSO. No. OLYMPIA. Not married! ALPHONSO. No, OLYMPIA. OLYMPIA. Not married!âOh such monstrous villainy!â I'm dizzyâhold meâah!â ALPHONSO. Alas! alas! What shall I do? Dear dear OLYMPIA!âah me! I fear she's dead. A sad and mortal paleness O'erspreads her lovely faceâThese hands are cold And damp as clayâShe does not breatheâO God, She's gone for everâDead, dead, dead, OLYMPIA! O horrible hour!âI follow thee,âyes, thou Shalt be my angel to conduct my flight From this base world.âShe stirsâthe deadly hue Shifts from her cheekâshe breathesâshe sighsâ OLYMPIA! OLYMPIA. Where am I?âAhâ ALPHONSO. Lift these sweet eyes again. OLYMPIA. Alas, this is no dream! I am awake. It is ALPHONSO!âwill no shock destroy me? Ah! when shall I be dead? OLYMPIA. Talk not of dying.â OLYMPIA, when you do, this world to me Becomes a waste: 'tis little better now. OLYMPIA. What blows of fate the wretched may survive! The worst I had to fear is come upon me; And yet I live!âButâ ALPHONSO. Something in that look Made beauty dreadful. OLYMPIA. Oh, my fatal rashness! Alas, ALPHONSO!âyet what could I do? Provoked by false intelligenceâhow false Is yet a MYSTERY; STURIO, an honest man, Your friend, produced it. Was there room to doubt Of his integrity? your well-known hand Confirmed it.âGod of Heaven! I must suppose Your friend corrupted, and that letter forged. What else?âI tore it hastily; yet still It was so perfectly your hand, O villainy! Ingenious villainy! 'twould have amazed you. ALPHONSO. Alas! this mystery is soon unravelled. Forgive th' intemperance of a frantic fit: 'Twas mine, OLYMPIA. OLYMPIA. This is stranger still. Quite inconceiveable! ALPHONSO. I'll tell you all: And when I've done judge if I was to blame. My father, as you know, when all his arts And interest fail'd to mitigate the King, Would needs himself accompany my exile. So much he stomached the disgrace, he swore The burning vault should swallow Naples ere He touched its shore again. Besides, he felt Too much his friend Lord STRENI's altering mind. He dwelt on that; it stung him keenly: me It only mortified. He strove in vain To rouse me to resentment. Inwardly He burnt for some fair opportunity, That I might be the first to cancel vows Which STRENI seemed not forward to confirm. The opportunity he wished for came As fate had winged it. For I had not long Pin'd at Palermo, when a friendship grew Between my father and the Count CASERTA; Who from some discontent had long before Retired from Naples thither, and still loved By sympathy whoever hated Naples. This noble Count, proud of his ancient blood, Had two young daughters. The eldest JULIA, Some time had lived confined for an attempt To steal a marriage with a youth whose family, Tho' not obscure, he thought no match for his. Now grown impatient of his jealous cares, It pleased him in my favour to let slip Some distant hints, which with a ranc'rous joy My father snatched; he pressed me eagerly To seize th' occasion: as inflexibly I waved th' unwelcome offer. Till at last There went a rumour made my blood run cold, That my false rival's suit was daily prospering. When I look back, 'twas his own crafty lie, For I can trace it to his emissaries; Tho', blinded then and giddy with despair And jealousy, too easily I was wrought on To give it credit. What confirmed it too Was that to all my frequent letters, one Reply had ne'er been made. OLYMPIA. Oh Heaven!ânot one Of all those letters ever came to chear My desolate mind. I guess'd the cause, it seems, Too truly.âBut proceed. ALPHONSO. Long urg'd and teiz'd In vain, at last provoked I made my suit; Which, from a coy reception, by degrees Was kindly entertained: but still it made A ling'ring progress, which I more rejoiced Than grieved at. For, tho' JULIA was compleat In all th' engaging ways that could be wished In a companion; and, tho' scarce a beauty, Had personal charms sufficient to surprize A vacant breast; yet, ah OLYMPIA! mine Still with vain efforts struggled to shake off Its first lov'd conqueror's sway; and still I hoped: Till with such plausible consistent strokes Your marriage was reported, that self-flattery No longer could amuse me. By this our fathers, Tired with a dallied courtship, hurryingly Urged on the treaty, and the day was fix'd. 'Twas now just not arrived, when late at night Your letter came. Never was mortal breast So tortured with conflicting powers; with joy, With anxious hopes and fluttering fears, shame, honour. Not for all Sicily would I again Endure that restless night's perplexity. Tho' 'twas determined in my mind, howe'er The world might clamour, that all other interests, All other decencies and duties, should Yield to my first engagement. The morning came On which I had to deal with difficulties That no address, without some miracle, Seemed equal to encounter. When, beholdâ JULIA was fled!âGood God! my lighten'd soul Grew mad with joy.âI took a hasty leave, And hied me hither. OLYMPIA. Ah! you came, ALPHONSO, But just too late. But Heaven would have it so.â I'm doom'd to wretchedness! ALPHONSO. Alas, OLYMPIA! Think on my misery! OLYMPIA. We both are ruined By those who loved us, and have been too busy To make us happy. ALPHONSO. Is there no resource? No means to burst thro' all these rotten ties, The work of treachery? Sure there are, OLYMPIA! Heaven does not hear involuntary vows, Vows cunningly surprized, or made in anger. Shall the heart's vows, the ties of mutual love, Old plighted faith, and sympathy of souls, Yield to a mere cold formal obligation? It must not be. I claim the elder right: You were by all consents devoted mine, Before this selfish in sincere profane Intruder ever saw you. Dear OLYMPIA, Let us oppose fair arts to impious fraud. I have the means at hand to snatch you from This fatal place, to where the purest vows May soon before the holy shrine dispel The sorcery of those sacrilegious rites; And to its lawful owner render back Th' inviolated prize. OLYMPIA. Alas! alas! ALPHONSO, this is raving. ALPHONSO. Where's the difliculty? The night comes on to favour this exploit. Let us not curse our timid hearts hereafter Because for fear of little squalls we lost The tide of fortune.âAh pity me, OLYMPIA! To live without you is despair and frenzy. I will not live upon such terms. OLYMPIA. Alas! What you propose is neither fit nor practicable. We needs must partâyes, we must part for ever. Farewell, ALPHONSO?âLeave me to my fate; No matter what it be. Farewell, farewellâ And when you think of me drop a sad tear, And say there was a maid that lov'd me more Than her own life. My kindest wishes still Attend you with a warmth no time can cool; And my last breath shall bless you. Again farewell. ALPHONSO. We must not part. OLYMPIA. We must, we must. Farewell.â I heard a foot; it comes this way.âIf e'er You loved me, leave this place without delay. Stay not a moment longer.âAh ALPHONSO!â Farewell for ever!â ALPHONSO. Stay, OLYMPIA! stay!â She's gone! O Heaven! SCENE III. ALPHONSO, CLAUDIO. CLAUDIO. Good God! it is ALPHONSO!â This is astonishing!âMy dear dear friend, This unexpected pleasure quite transports me. Thrice welcome, dear ALPHONSO! ALPHONSO. Generous ALPHONSO, I know it, and I thank your courtly words. Would thoughts were visible, that it might appear With what sincerity we love eash other. But compliments apart, pray are you not Ashamed to see me? CLAUDIO. Why, ALPHONSO? ALPHONSO. Nay, I know how nobly some despise all shame. But are you not afraid to see the man Who feels his wrongs, and will no longer bear 'em? CLAUDIO. I never was afraid to meet my foe, Much less to see my friend. You have no cause I'm sure, ALPHONSO, not to be my friend. Were all the truth known it would soon appear How from my heart I am, and still have been, My generous brave ALPHONSO's. Hitherto Indeed my friendly aims have still been cross'd; And I have felt it more perhaps than you. Tho' now those rubs to me seem rather fortunate: For little steps, by which each ass can climb, Are rather checks to merit, and disgrace Generous ambition; which at one bold flight Should seize a station worthy of itself. And now the time draws near, when I shall prove By deeds with what sincerity I still Have lov'd ALPHONSO. Something that may suit Aspiring worth I purpose to resign; And but retain it till my interest has Secured it yours. Nay were you not my friend, Of all men living I should wish it yours: Because I love my country as I ought, And would be honoured in my successor. ALPHONSO. Fine words! enough to make a gull of one That did not know you. But they cost you nothingâ You talk of friendship! and to me, presumptuous! You never was a friend, nor ever can be: I know what spurious metal you are made of. I come not here to dangle or amuse The fool of hope with catching slippery promises. I scorn the paultry sport.âYet there's one favour. The only one that I shall ever deign To ask or to receive of you. CLAUDIO. What's that? ALPHONSO. There is a fountain in the grove behind The gardens, if you'll meet me there alone Within this half hour, 'twill oblige me. CLAUDIO. Ha! ha! If one could guess why, this would seem a challenge. You're pleasant, dear ALPHONSO. Ha! ha! ha! ALPHONSO. You will not laugh it off so. CLAUDIO. If you're serious, Why should I from the mere contagion of An angry look, or a few hasty words, Give up my calm mind to a giddy storm? Or be with impotent madness drawn into The eddy of my erring friend's conceits? If when my friend is drunk with causeless rage I lose my sober temper, I become The greater lunatic. Hear me, good ALPHONSO: I can and dare; but yet I should be sorry To use my sword without some solid cause. 'T must be a solid cause indeed that spurs me To point it at the honest breast of one I've lov'd so truly. And, for all your anger, Believe me (for I know myself and you) Which of us ever falls, the other leads A life of horror and remorse no time Can ever cure. Then ere we fight at least Let us explain ourselves. 'Tis chiefly from Fantastic jealousies, childish fits of spleen, Mistakes on one side and false pride on th' other, That honest men e'er quarrel.âPray, ALPHONSO, In what have I offended? ALPHONSO. Holy Heaven! Who would not think this cheat a saint, an oracle? But there's no devil to a smooth-tongued villain.â In what have you offended?âHark ye, tell me Who was it that procured my banishment? Who was it that embargoed sacred truth, To give free traffic to pernicious lies? And by the most persidious arts contriv'd To step between me and my dearest right?â I see by your look you're innocent of the matter. Deny it if you dare, I'll force the lie Down that false throat. CLAUDIO. In one not given to wine; Such frolics must proceed from want of sleep. Calm these wild spirits with one night's repose, And then I'll talk with you. ALPHONSO. Buffoon, no shuffling! One of us two shall sleep his last to-night.â You'll meet me presently. CLAUDIO. Excuse me now, I'm otherways engaged. ALPHONSO. You lie. CLAUDIO. Beware, I must not hear this. ALPHONSO. You lie. CLAUDIO. Nay, thenâ ALPHONSO. A stab! Well aimed to miss. Now have at your false heart. SCENE IV. ALPHONSO, CLAUDIO, STRENI, and Servants. STRENI. [their swords.â What's this? what's this? Good Heaven!âbeat down Hold, hold, I charge you.âPart themâAre you mad?â Pray how began this fray? ALPHONSO, CLAUDIO, You're both my friends, and I am shocked so see Such hot-brained work between you. How began this?â Go you and wait withoutâPray who began this? Come, ALPHONSO, tell me,âwas it you? CLAUDIO. My Lord, I ne'er began a quarrel.âLet me breathe firstâ And then I'll tell you.â ALPHONSO. Nay, 'twas I; I own it.â Who else had reason to complain? 'Twas I, Provoked by monstrous injuries, who gave Opprobrious truths a vent. But 'twas not I, Who like a cut-throat, an insidious coward, Aimed at my unguarded enemy's heart. I'm sorry It should have happened here. I did not mean To scare the peace of this respected house With angry deeds. STRENI. Young blood is hot. ALPHONSO. When I was young like you my sword would ach At every slight offence: where none was meant I've been too madly brave. But when the fit Was fairly fought out, it never failed to end In warmest friendship. Trust me we have wept With generous passion, at the sudden change From bloody strife to cordial amity. There is no joy to that which noble foes At reconcilement feel. Come, come your hands; Yours ALPHONSO, yours ALPHONSO. Come, embrace: Be friends for ever. CLAUDIO. I have ever been, And still shall be ALPHONSO's. ALPHONSO. As sincerely Shall I be CLAUDIO'sâBut you'll meet me? CLAUDIO. Yes. ALPHONSO. Directly. CLAUDIO. Doubt not. ALPHONSO. Till thenâfarewell.âGood night. My Lord, I must away. If you have ought To do at Naples, I'm your post; for there I must be ere I sleep. STRENI. Good night, ALPHONSO. I'm sorry for this haste: next time we meet I hope to taste your company at more leisure. SCENE V. STRENI, CLAUDIO. STRENI. How does my Count? You are not hurt I hope? CLAUDIO. Not hurt, my Lord, but truly much amazed. I did not dream to meet ALPHONSO here; Still less that we should quarrel. STRENI. 'Tis no wonder. CLAUDIO. Not, that he should, before his wedding day Could well be over, traverse land and sea In search of quarrels? STRENI. There's your mistake, my friend.â That marriage came to nothing. CLAUDIO. Is it possible? STRENI, 'Tis true. CLAUDIO. Nay, then no wonder he should seek To pierce my heart thro'. But how could this happen? STRENI. I've learnt it but just now. 'Tis so. Within I'll tell you how. SCENE VI. CLAUDIO, an Officer. OFFICER. My Lord, my Lord, Lord CLAUDIO! CLAUDIO. Ha! who is this?âmy watchful friend? what news? There's horror in thy look. OFFICER. Fly, fly, my Lord. This instant fly. They'll presently be here. Your life is sold. Fly, fly. CLAUDIO. My life? OFFICER. Your kinsman Has bought his own with yours. CLAUDIO. I thank him. Come; Thy hand, I owe thee much; and if I live Thou'rt made for ever. OFFICER. Ah! my good Lord. But fly. Lose not a moment. Could I but contrive To misdirect their search.âI'll try. CLAUDIO. Farewell. Success attend you. SCENE VII. CLAUDIO. What a fool was I Not to have laid this prating knave asleep, This tell-tale coward, when I safely might? But that's too late.âWhat's next?âI'll meet my foe.â This challenge happens well. For if he drops, I fly for that; no other crime supposed To startle me. 'Tis something, plausibly To shun the fire-edge of a nation's vengeance. And to gain time gives art and fortune room To work such happy wonders, that despair Should never seize the wise.âBut should I fall By this impetuous boy.âYet better so Than give the curious mob a holiday To see my head jump off.âBut then he comes A conqueror to possess my bridal bed; And meet with mutual ardour virgin charms That fruitlesly were mine.âThat's worse than death! It must not be. Against a deadly foe All arts are justified. Thou dy'st, ALPHONSO. Prepare to meet a sterner bride. I come: Please Heaven thou shalt not triumph in my doom. ACT V. SCENE I. STRENI, VICTORIA. STRENI. 'Tis but a qualm, a fit o' th' spleen, that's all. 'Twill soon blow over. VICTORIA. Consider it not so slightly, My Lord: she's dreadfully ill; so much unhinged The down that hardly lights might turn the scale And sink her past recovery.âO 'twas frightful To see her agonies! STRENI. How was she taken? VICTORIA. With a countenance so changed I hardly knew her, Sobbing and trembling, shockingly pale as from A mortal wound, she burst into the room And flounced upon the floor. I flew to raise her; Let me lie still and die, she said: half raised Flat on her face she rush'd again, and lay Like one abandoned to despair. Astonish'd What this should mean, I learnt at last a tale Enough to make her mad indeed.âYou know it. STRENI. It happened ill; 'twas pity. But what next? VICTORIA. After the sad recital, long she sat Pensive, and lost in thought: one might as well Have talk'd to a statue; at last she started up And walk'd about and muttered frantickly. Music, her favourite study and delight, I hoped might calm her; but no sooner rushed The harmony on her ears than down she sunk Upon a couch, and wept immoderately. I thought my heart would have broke.â STRENI. My poor OLYMPIA! VICTORIA. I sent to stop the music. After a pause Of silent grief, a fit of laughing seized her, So violent, so unnatural as it seemed, 'Twas perfectly shocking. It left her quite exhausted; And now she sleeps. STRENI. She has had such fits before. This kind repose will cure her. Poor OLYMPIA Has ever been too sensible to grief, To joy, to all impressions; the misfortune Of delicate spirits, which shake at every gust That blows or hot or cold. Do, my VICTORIA, Go keep all quiet, and when she wakes send hither. She'll soon be well. VICTORIA. Would I were sure of that! STRENI. O never doubt it.âWho's there?âHow I'm beset With teizing cares and fretful circumstances! SCENE II. STRENI, a Servant. STRENI. No news yet of the Count? not one returned yet Of those that went to search? SERVANT. Not one, my Lord. STRENI. You sent them different ways? SERVANT. My Lord, I did. STRENI. I doubt some misadventure. Go, LORENZO, Speed me the news whate'er they be, and rid me Of this suspense. SCENE III. STRENI. There's mischief in the wind. He slipt abruptly from me, after some Ambiguous words, which then I did not mark. They've surely met. That reconcilement was A sham to blind me. I remember now At shaking hands they whisper'd something.âDeath! I might have guess'd it. But who could have dreamt He would have been so mad? What, in the name Of all that's blundering, could provoke a man Of courage so well proved, at such a time To meet a foe whose challenge at any time He might more to his dignity refuse? Curse on his ill-tim'd valour!âI hope he's kill'd. By heaven I care not! Such romantic fools Should have no friends, and when they fall deserve No pity.âGods! will none come breathless in To tell me he lies cold?âHere comes the tale. Out with itâspeakâthe worst at once. SCENE IV. STRENI, a Servant. SERVANT. My Lord, The gates are all beset with armed men. STRENI. Confusion! What is this? What armed men? Is this young ruffian mad? From its firm base He heaves this marble-pillar'd castle first, And mounts it on the windâHe force these gates! Were he an earthquake shot from hell he should not.â What armed men? SERVANT. The servants of the state. STRENI. O God! God! God! SERVANT. Their leading officer, My Lord, desires an audience. STRENI. Send him hither. SCENE V. STRENI. O monstrous! monstrous! O amazing villain! I'm stupified to death. The world might rush And I not feel it now. SCENE VI. STRENI, OFFICERS. OFFICER. My Lord, I come On an unpleasing duty, to demand On the state's part, one whom may justice find Without a flaw, a guest of this fair roofâ Count CLAUDIO. STRENI. Sir, he was here, but is gone; And may all plagues go with him. Sir, he's vanished. He disappeared, as fiends do, suddenly. By this he shakes all hell with laughing at Our fruitless search. OFFICER. My Lord, you cannot mean To hide him from the state. Th' attempt were vain, Might turn suspicion into certainty. Where'er he be, if I may judge, my Lord, 'Twere wise he fhould surrender. STRENI. Sir, this house [Rings.] Is open to you; find him if you can. These walls shall screen no traitor. If he's here I'm much deceived. OFFICER. I doubt not, good my Lord, Your well known honour. But the state's command Must punctually be followed; and I hope My Lord will pardon to our present office What rigid form exacts. STRENI. You're welcome, Sir. Who's there?âLORENZO, shew these Gentlemen That if there lurks a traitor here; this house Is sick till it disgorge him. OFFICER. After what You have declared, my Lord, our search becomes A fruitless office, a mere ceremony; Which you'll excuse. STRENI. O Sir, most heartily. SCENE VII. STRENI. O this infernal traitor! what could move him T' abuse me thus!âHe thought perhaps to screen His frauds by my alliance. Subtle fool, This unaccomplish'd treaty binds us not. Or if it did; were he my daughter's husband, And she a mother by him, he should find me No patron of his crimes. Ah poor OLYMPIA! How I have plagued myself and tortured thee, To match thee thus unworthily!âDeath and hell! What madness, what curs'd dÃ¦mon, prompted me T' anticipate the day? Had I not been Bereft of judgment and all patience this Disgrace could ne'er have touched us.âO fool! O shame! To be this felon's tool! Yet who could dream He should be such a villain? How unshaken, He stood what conscious innocence might shrink at! But callous villainy feels no shameâ SCENE VIII. STRENI, a Servant. SERVANT. My Lord, I bring disastrous news. STRENI. Let those who ne'er Have felt misfortune start when sorrow's named. For me I grow so hardened to all shocks I might defy the fates. Then tell thy tale, Were it as mortal as the cannon's mouth Discharge it on mine ear. SERVANT. My Lord,âALPHONSO Is kill'd. STRENI. Unfortunate youth! SERVANT. The Count is fled, With fifty horsemen at his heels. STRENI. I grieve For poor ALPHONSO.âWhere found you him? SERVANT. In the Grove. Shot thro' the breast; just dropt; his hand clinch'd on His half-drawn sword. STRENI. O murderous villain!âGo, Compose the body privately; and let No whisper of this sad event steal out T' alarm too tender ears.â SCENE IX. STRENI. Ah poor OLYMPIA! How shall thy tottering senses bear this shock? Had I not fatally interposed thou mightst Have been the happiestâ SCENE X. STRENI, VICTORIA. VICTORIA. O my Lord! my Lord!â STRENI. What now, VICTORIA? VICTORIA. Poor OLYMPIA!â STRENI. What! VICTORIA. O mad! mad! mad! The poor dear creature's mad! STRENI. Just heaven forbid! VICTORIA. Alas! it is too sure.â Just now from a most unquiet sleep, that seem'd Nature conflicting with despair, she started; Cried murder! murder! help! ALPHONSO's murder'd! Then with such wildness in her looks and action, Such frantic vehemence of terror, grief, And pity, she address'd th' invisible air; It chill'd us all with horror.âYou'd have thought ALPHONSO had been kill'd indeed, and that His ghost stood there. STRENI. Amazement! VICTORIA. By and by She flew to the window; whence, her delicate frame Is with convulsive violence so possess'd, 'Twas all that three of us could do to hinder A fatal leap. STRENI. Heaven guard my child! [Going.] OLYMPIA, bebind the Scenes. Away! Away! I say.â STRENI. Hush! OLYMPIA. Hold me not, good fiends! In God's name vanish! Fly, fly, fly! WOMAN. Dear Madam!â SCENE XI. STRENI, VICTORIA, OLYMPIA, Women, OLYMPIA. Dear me no dear! I'll not be dear'd. Avaunt, Ye wheedling witches! I know who taught you that. Off, I conjure youâGoâHah! what are these! STRENI. How does my dearest child! OLYMPIA. This looks so like My father, and speaks so like him! STRENI. I am, I am. Dost thou not know me? OLYMPIA. Are you not a ghost then? Mere visible nothing, as inessential As the vain rainbow? With reverence let me touch Your hand. I shall know by that.âO 'tis, 'tis, 'tis My real father, let me kiss for ever This sacred hand. I'll never part with it more.â But why d'ye look so sad? There's something troubles you. STRENI. Alas, my child!â OLYMPIA. O do not weep; that's dreadful. My heart is ready to break to see you thus: And yet I cannot weep. Oh! Oh!âCome, this way, Let us go home. STRENI. Thou'rt there already. OLYMPIA. O fye That you should talk so!âD'ye see these creatures? STRENI. Yes. Your faithful servants. OLYMPIA, Witches! witches! witches! The mermaids of the burning sea!âHeaven snatch us From these enchanted walls!âTh' arch conjurer Will soon be here, and then all's lost.â STRENI. Who's that? OLYMPIA. His name isâI forget it, but you may guess.â Do not be angry. My head's confused a little: But I hope I said no harm. I named no body: Yet I'm afraid you're angry.âO blast me not With your heavy curses! STRENI. Heaven for ever bless My dearest child! OLYMPIA. Indeed you are too kind To your poor unduteous daughter. Heaven and you Forgive my crimes! that I may die when I please.â O curse on all mistakes! STRENI. What dost thou mean? OLYMPIA. I'll tell you when the mists are gone.âI have it. I chid ALPHONSO cruellyâHeaven forgive me!â Indeed he was not such a fickle coxcomb As some suppose.âThey told me he was married; But I know other matters.âOh! oh! oh!â STRENI. Kind Heaven restore her precious wits again, And punish me with any other plague But this!â OLYMPIA. D'ye know what I dreamt last night?âOh 'twas hide o us fancy!â STRENI. Never mind dreams, my child. OLYMPIA. The Moon spoke to me! 'Twas horrible. Yet that Was a trifle to what happened afterwards.â O this head! this head!â I cannot put it into words; but while Such dreams are going who would dare to sleep?â I have not slept this month. VICTORIA. Come, dear OLYMPIA, 'Tis late, come go to bed. I'll watch by your side, While sweet repose dissolves those idle fears. Let us to bed. OLYMPIA. Away!âAre you a witch too! You league against me too?âCousin of vengeance, Hark you, I'll never go to bed; I'll die first.â O fye, fye, fye! to what would you betray me! Go, go, vile-shocking creature!â STRENI. This to VICTORIA, Your dearest friend, OLYMPIA? OLYMPIA. Yes, my friend! Such friends as Heaven defend me from!âMy friend, To snatch the antidote of all sorcery from me? The balm that heals all wounds.âAh you're a trusty one; Would I had known you sooner! STRENI. What means this? VICTORIA. Mere jealous fancies, sick imaginations, Like all the rest. OLYMPIA. Hark ye:âNay if you weep I've done. I'm such a tender hearted fool.â Ah VICTORIA, VICTORIA!â VICTORIA. Dear dear OLYMPIA!â OLYMPIA. Hush! What's that? Let me go. He's coming. VICTORIA. Who, my dear! OLYMPIA. 'Tis CLAUDIO.âHide me!â STRENI. He'll trouble thee no more.âHe's gone. OLYMPIA. Ah! would I had never seen him! that's my prayer, and if There's any harm in itâO Heaven!âSee there! STRENI. Bless thee! What's there? OLYMPIA. See! See! STRENI. See what, my child? OLYMPIA. D'ye ask? STRENI. What should I see? OLYMPIA. A sight to break A heart of rock, and make the lion whine Like a whipt spaniel.âALPHONSO pale and bloody! O misery, misery! O most lamented youth! Who did this cruel stern remorseless deed No miracle can undo?âDead, murder'd, butcher'd! Speak, I conjure you. Dear dreadful vision, say What ruffian shall be torn on the wheel for this? Oh! 'tis not to be born to see you look so.â Speak if thou canstâHe's gone! STRENI. Alas! my child, Thou speak'st to the winds. OLYMPIA. Good God!âVICTORIA!â VICTORIA. 'Twas a mere fancy, for ALPHONSO lives; And lives, I hope, for many happy days With his OLYMPIA. OLYMPIA. Insupportable! Must I be juggled out of my senses thus? It seems I am a child, a fool. Wise cousin, Pray do not laugh at me: do not, I say. And yet it may be wit perhaps to jest With torture and despair. VICTORIA. Can you suspect me For such a monster? OLYMPIA. Did you not see him plainly? VICTORIA. Believe me, no. OLYMPIA. That's strange! that's strange, indeed! STRENI. How deadly pale, She's grown!âThou'rt sick, my child. OLYMPIA. Too well, too well! Only a little chilliness wanders o'er me.â Hark how my ears ring! Lend me your hand, VICTORIA. VICTORIA. Alas! thou shudder'st so thou canst not stand. Cold sweats bedew thee; thou'rt ready to faint, dear girl. Come, lean upon this couch. So.â OLYMPIA. As you will. Do with me what you please.âHa! there again! Now if you do not see him you're blind.âDear father Behold! see there!âI come, I come, ALPHONSO! Receive me Heavenâand youâ STRENI. Ah! hold her up! She falls like one shot thro' the brain. VICTORIA. Alas! She's dead! dead! dead! STRENI. 'Tis but a fit I hope.â Hold up her head.âHelp, help! Oh all the world To hear her speak again!âAh me! that face Is fix'd in death. She's cold, coldâpoor OLYMPIA! I've liv'd too long. She's gone, my faultless child For ever goneâand I her murdererâOh!</field>
