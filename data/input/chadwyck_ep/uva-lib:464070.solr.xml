In nomine Patris et Filij et Spirituc Sancti. Amen pur charite. Amen. Now grett glorious Godde, thurgh grace of hym seluene, And the precyous prayere of hys prys modyr, Schelde vs ffro schamesdede and synfulle werkes, And gyffe vs grace to gye, and gouerne vs here, In this wrechyde werlde thorowe vertous lywynge, That we may kayre til hys courte, the kyngdome of hevyne, Whene oure saules schalle parte and sundyre ffra the body, Ewyre to belde and to byde in blysse wyth hyme seluene; And wysse me to werpe owte some worde at this tyme, That nothyre voyde be ne vayne, bot wyrchip tille hyme selvyne, Plesande and profitabille to the popule that theme heres. ?e that liste has to lyth, or luffes for to here, Off elders of alde tyme and of theire awke dedys, How they were lele in theire lawe, and louede God Almyghty, Herkynes me heyndly and holdys ?ow stylle, And I salle telle ?ow a tale, that trewe es and nobylle, Off the ryealle renkys of the Rownnde Table, That chefe ware of cheualrye and cheftans nobylle, Bathe ware in thire werkes and wyse mene of armes, Doughty in theire doyngs, and dredde ay schame, Kynde mene and courtays, and couthe of courte thewes; How they whanne wyth were wyrchippis many, Sloughe Lucyus the lythyre, that lorde was of Rome, And conqueryd that kyngryke thorowe craftys of armes; Herkenes now hedyrwarde, and herys this storye. Qwene that the kynge Arthur by conqueste hade wonnyne Castelles and kyngdoms, and contreez many, And he had couerede the coroune of the kyth ryche, Of alle that Vter in erthe aughte in his tyme, Orgayle and Orkenay, and alle this owte-iles, Irelande vttirly, as Occyane rynnys; Scathylle Scottlande by skylle he skyftys as hym lykys, And Wales of were he wane at hys wille, Bathe fflaundrez and ffraunce fre til hym seluyne; Holaund and Henawde they helde of hyme bothen, Burgoyne and Brabane, and Bretayne the lesse, Gyane and Gothelande, and Grece the ryche; Bayone and Burdeux he beldytt fulle faire, Turoyne and Tholus with toures fulle hye; Off Peyters and of Prouynce he was prynce holdyne, Of Valence and Vyenne, off value so noble, Of Eruge and Anyone, thos erledoms ryche; By conqueste fulle cruelle they knewe hym fore lorde, Of Nauerne and Norwaye, and Normaundye eke, Of Almayne, of Estriche, and other ynowe; Danmarke he dryssede alle by drede of hym seluyne, ffra Swynne vnto Swetherwyke, with his swerde kene! Qwenne he thes dedes had done, he doubbyd hys knyghtez, Dyuysyde dowcherys and delte in dyuerse remmes; Mad of his cosyns kyngys ennoyntede, In kyth there they couaitte crounes to bere. Whene he thys rewmes hade redyne and rewlyde the popule, Then rystede that ryalle and helde the Rounde Tabylle; Suggeourns that sesone to solace hyme seluene, In Bretayne the braddere, as hym beste lykes; Sythyne wente in-to Wales with his wyes alle, Sweys in-to Swaldye with his snelle houndes, For to hunt at the hartes in thas hye lanndes, In Glamorgane with glee, thare gladchipe was euere. And thare a citee he sette, be assentte of his lordys, That Caerlyone was callid, with curius walles, On the riche reuare that rynnys so faire, There he myghte semble his sorte to see whenne hym lykyde; Thane aftyre at Carlelele a Cristynmese he haldes, This ilke kyde conquerour, and helde hym for lorde, Wyth dukez and dusperes of dyuers rewmes, Erles and ercheuesqes, and other ynowe, Byschopes and bachelers, and banerettes nobille, That bowes to his banere, buske whene hym lykys: Boton the Cristynmesdaye, whene they were alle semblyde, That comlyche conquerour commaundez hym seluyne That ylke a lorde sulde lenge, and no lefe take, To the tende day fully ware takyne to the ende. Thus one ryalle araye he helde his Rounde Table, With semblant and solace and selcouthe metes; Whas neuer syche noblay, in no manys tyme, Mad in mydwynter in tha weste marchys! Bot on the new?ere daye, at the none cuyne, As the bolde at the borde was of brede seruyde, So come in sodanly a senatour of Rome, Wyth sextene knyghtes in a soyte, sewande hym one. He salu?ed the souerayne and the sale aftyr, Ilke a kynge aftyre kynge, and mad his enclines; Gaynour in hir degré he grette as hym lykyde, And syne agayne to the gome he gaffe vp his nedys: “Sir Lucius Iberius, the Emperour of Rome, Saluz the as sugett, vndyre his sele ryche; It es credens, sir kynge, with cruelle wordez, Trow it for no trufles, his targe es to schewe! Now in this new?ers daye with notaries sygne, I make the somouns in sale to sue for thi landys, That on Lammesse daye thare be no lette ffoundene, That thow bee redy at Rome with alle thi Rounde Table, Appere in his presens with thy price knyghtez, At pryme of the daye, in payne of ?our lyvys, In the kydde Capytoile before the kyng selvyne, Whene he and his senatours bez sette as them lykes, To ansuere anely why thow ocupyes the lanndez, That awe homage of alde tille hym and his eldyrs; Why thow has redyne and raymede, and raunsound the pople, And kyllyde doune his cosyns, kyngys ennoynttyde; Thare schalle thow gyffe rekkynynge for alle thy Round Table, Why thow arte rebelle to Rome, and rentez theme wytholdez! ?iff thow theis somouns wythsytte, he sendes thie thies wordes, He salle the seke ouer the see wyth sextene kynges, Bryne Bretayne the brade, and bryttyne thy knyghtys, And brynge the bouxsomly as a beste with brethe whare hym lykes, That thow ne schalle rowte ne ryste vndyr the heuene ryche, Thofe thow for reddour of Rome ryne to the erthe! ffor if thow flee in-to Fraunce or ffreselannd owther, Thou salle be fechede with force, and ouersette fore euer! Thy fadyr mad fewtee, we fynde in oure rollez, In the regestre of Rome, who so ryghte lukez: With-owttyne more trouflynge the trebute we aske, That Iulius Cesar wane wyth his ientille knyghttes!” The kynge blyschit one the beryne with his brode eghne, That fulle brymly for breth brynte as the gledys; Keste colours as kynge with crouelle lates, Luked as a lyone, and on his lyppe bytes! The Romaynes for radnesse ruschte to the erthe, ffore ferdnesse of hys face, as they fey were; Cowchide chide as kenetez be-fore the kynge seluyne, Be-cause of his contenaunce confusede theme semede! Thene couerd vp a knyghte, and criede ful lowde, “Kynge corounede of kynd, curtays and noble, Misdoo no messangere for menske of thi seluyne, Sen we are in thy ma?rede, and mercy the besekes; We lenge with sir Lucius, that lorde es of Rome, That es the meruelyousteste mane that on molde lengez; It es lefulle tille vs his likynge tille wyrche; We come at his commaundment; haue vs excusede.” Then carpys the conquerour crewelle wordez,— “Haa! crauaunde knyghte! a cowarde the semez! Thare [is] some segge in this sale, and he ware sare greuede, Thow durste noghte for alle Lumberdye luke one hym ones.” “Sir,” sais the senatour, “so Crist mott me helpe, The voute of thi vesage has woundyde vs alle! Thow arte the lordlyeste lede that euer I one lukyde; By lukynge, with-owttyne lesse, a lyone the semys!” “Thow has me somonde,” quod the kynge, “and said what the lykes; ffore sake of thy soueraynge I suffre the the more; Sen I corou?de in kyth wyth crysume enoyntede, Was neuer creature to me that carpede so large! Bot I salle tak concelle at kynges enoyntede, Off dukes and duspers and doctours noble, Offe peres of the parlement, prelates and other, Off the richeste renkys of the Rounde Table; Thus schalle I take avisemente of valiant beryns, Wyrke aftyre the wytte of my wyes knyghttes: To warpe wordez in waste no wyrchipe it were, Ne wilfully in this wrethe to wrekene my seluene. ffor-thi salle thow lenge here, and lugge wyth thise lordes, This seuenyghte in solace, to suggourne ?our horses, To see whatte lyfe that wee leede in thees lawe lanndes.” ffor by the realtee of Rome, that recheste was euere, He commande sir Cayous, “take kepe to thoos lordez, To styghtylle tha steryne mene as theire statte askys, That they bee herberde in haste in thoos heghe chambres, Sythine sittandly in sale seruyde ther-aftyr; That they fynd na fawte of fude to thiere horsez, Nowthire weyne, ne waxe, ne welthe in this erthe; Spare for no spycerye, bot spende what the lykys, That there be largesce one lofte, and no lake foundene; If thou my wyrchipe wayte, wy, be my trouthe, Thou salle haue gersoms fulle grett, that gayne salle the euere!” Now er they herberde in hey, and in oste holdene, Hastyly wyth hende mene with-in thees heghe wallez; In chambyrs with chympnes they chaungene theire wedez, And sythyne the chauncelere theme fecchede with cheualrye noble. Sone the senatour was sett, as hyme wele semyde, At the kyngez ownne borde; twa knyghtes hym seruede, Singulere sothely, as Arthure hym seluyne, Richely on the ryghte hannde at the Rounde Table; Be resoune that the Romaynes whare so ryche holdene, As of the realeste blode that reynede in erthe. There come in at the fyrste course, be-for the kynge seluene, Bareheuedys that ware bryghte, burnyste with syluer, Alle with taghte mene and towne in togers fulle ryche, Of saunke realle in suyte, sexty at ones; fflesch fluriste of fermysone with frumentee noble, Ther-to wylde to wale, and wynlyche bryddes, Pacokes and plouers in platers of golde, Pygges of porke despyne, that pasturede neuer; Sythene herons in hedoyne, hyled fulle faire; Grett swannes fulle swythe in silueryne chargeours, Tartes of Turky, taste whame theme lykys; Gumbaldes graythely, fulle gracious to taste; Seyne bowes of wylde bores with the braune lechyde, Bernakes and botures in baterde dysches, Thareby braunchers in brede, bettyr was neuer, With brestez of barowes, that bryghte ware to schewe; Seyne come ther sewes sere, with solace ther-after, Ownde of azure alle ouer and ardant them semyde, Of ilke a leche the lowe launschide fulle hye, That alle ledes myghte lyke that lukyde theme apone; Thane cranes and curlues craftyly rosted, Connygez in cretoyne colourede fulle faire, ffesauntez enflureschit in flammande siluer, With darielles endordide, and daynteez ynewe; Thane clarett and Creette, clergyally rennene, With condethes fulle curious alle of clene siluyre; Osay a[n]d algarde, and other ynewe, Rynisch wyne and Rochelle, richere was neuer; Vernage of Venyee vertuouse and Crete; In faucetez of fyne golde, fonode who so lykes; The kyngez cope-borde was closed in siluer, In grete goblettez ouergylte glorious of hewe; There was a cheeffe buttlere, a cheualere noble, Sir Cayous the curtaise, that of the cowpe seruede; Sexty cowpes of suyte fore the kyng seluyne, Crafty and curious, coruene fulle faire, In euer-ilk a party pyghte with precyous stones, That nane enpoysone sulde goo preuely ther-vndyre, Bot the bryght golde for brethe sulde briste al to peces, Or ells the venyme sulde voyde thurghe vertue of the stones; And the conquerour hymseluene, so clenly arayede, In colours of clene golde cleede, wyth his knyghttys, Drissid with his dyademe one his deesse ryche, ffore he was demyde the doughtyeste that duellyde in erthe. Thane the conquerour kyndly carpede to those lordes, Rehetede the Romaynes with realle speche, “Sirs, bez knyghtly of contenaunce, and comfurthes ?our seluyne, We knowe noghte in this countré of curious metez; In thees barayne landez, bredes none other, ffore-thy wythowttyne feynynge, enforce ?ow the more To feede ?ow with syche feble as ?e be-fore fynde.” “Sir,” sais the senatour, “so Criste motte me helpe! There ryngnede neuer syche realtee with-in Rome walles! There ne es prelatte, ne pape, ne prynce in this erthe, That he ne myghte be wele payede of thees pryce metes!” Aftyre theyre welthe they wesche, and went vn-to chambyre, This ilke kydde conquerour with knyghtes ynewe; Sir Gaywayne the worthye Dame Waynour he ledys; Sir Owghtreth on the tother syde, of Turry was lorde. Thane spyces vn-sparyly thay spendyde there-aftyre, Maluesye and muskadelle, thase meruelyous drynkes, Raykede fulle rathely in rossete cowpes, Tille alle the riche on rawe, Romaynes and other. Bot the soueraingne sothely, for solauce of hym seluene, Assingnyde to the senatour certaygne lordes, To lede to his leueré, whene he leue askes, With myrthe and with melodye of mynstralsy noble. Thane the conquerour to concelle cayres there-aftyre, Wyth lordes of his lygeaunce that to hym selfe langys; To the geauntes toure iolily he wendes, Wyth justicez and i?ggez, and gentille knyghtes. Sir Cador of Cornewayle to the kynge carppes, Lughe one hyme luffly with lykande lates,— “I thanke Gode of that thraa that vs thus thretys! ?ow moste be traylede, I trowe, bot ?ife ?e trett bettyre: The lettres of sir Lucius lyghttys myne herte!

Might I with wirchipe wyne awaye ones, I sulde neuer fore emperour, that on erthe lenges, Efte vnto Arthure ayere one syche nedys; Bot I am sengilly here, with sex sum of knyghtes; I be-seke ?ow, sir, that we may sounde passe: If any vnlawefulle lede lette vs by the waye, With-in thy lycence, lorde, thy loosse es enpeyrede.” “Care noghte,” quod the kynge, “thy coundyte es knawene ffro Carlelele to the coste, there thy cogge lengges; Thoghe thy cofers ware fulle, cramede with syluer, Thow myghte be sekyre of my sele sexty myle forthire.” They enclined to the kynge, and coungé thay askede, Cayers owtt of Carelele, catchez one theire horsez; Sir Cadore the curtayes kende theme the wayes, To Catrike theme cunvayede, and to Crist theme bekennyde. So they spede at the spoures, they sprangene theire horses, Hyres theme hakenayes hastyly there-aftyre; So fore reddour they redene, and risted theme neuer, Bot ?if they luggede vndire lynd, whills theme lyghte failede; Bot euere the senatour for-sothe soghte at the gayneste. By the seuende day was gone the cetee thai rechide; Of alle the glee vndire Gode so glade ware they neuere, As of the sounde of the see and Sandwyche belles! Wythowttyne more stownntynge they schippide theire horsez, Wery to the wane see they went alle att ones; With the mene of the walle they weyde vp theire ankyrs, And fleede at the fore flude, in Flaundrez they rowede, And thorughe Flaundres they founde, as theme faire thoghte, Tille Akyne in Almayne, in Arthur landes; Gosse by the Mount Goddarde fulle greuous wayes, And so in-to Lumberddye, lykande to schewe; They turne thurghe Tuskayne, with towres fulle heghe, In pris appairelles theme in precious wedez; The Sonondaye in suters thay suggourne theire horsez, And sekes the Seyntez of Rome, be assente of knyghtes; Sythyne prekes to the pales with portes so ryche, Thare sir Lucius lenges with lordes enowe; Lowttes to hym lufly, and lettres hym bedes Of credence enclosyde, with knyghtlyche wordez. Thene the emperour was egree, and enkerly fraynes, The answere of Arthure he askes hyme sone, How he arayes the rewme, and rewlys the pople; ?if he be rebelle to Rome, whate ryghte that he claymes: “Thow sulde his ceptre haue sesede, and syttyne aboune, ffore reuerence and realtee of Rome the noble: By sertes thow was my sandes, and senatour of Rome, He sulde fore solempnitee hafe seruede the hym seluene.” “That wille he neuer for no waye of alle this werlde ryche, Bot who may wynne hym of werre, by wyghtnesse of handes; Many fey schalle be fyrste appone the felde leuyde, Are he appere in this place, profre whene the likes.

Thy nedes this newe ?ere, I notifiede my selfene, Be-fore that noble of name and neynesome of kynges; In the moste reale place of the Rounde Table, Isomounde hyme solempnylye, one-seeande his knyghtez; Sene I was formyde in faythe so ferde was I neuere, In alle the placez ther I passede of pryncez in erthe!

Syche contenaunce was neuer knowene in no kythe ryche, As was with that connquerour in his courte haldene; I countede at this Crystynmesse, of kyngez enoynttede, Hole tene at his table, that tyme with hyme selfene; He wylle werraye i-wysse, be ware ?if the lykes, Wage many wyghtemene, and wache thy marches, That they be redye in araye, and at areste foundyne; ffor ?ife he reche vn-to Rome, he raunsouns it for euere!

Thare the grete ware gederyde, wyth galyarde knyghtes, Garneschit one the grene felde and graythelyche arayede; Dukkes and duzseperez daynttehely rydes, Erlez of Ynglande with archers ynewe: Schirreues scharply schiftys the comouns, Rewlys be-fore the ryche of the Rounde Table, Assingnez ilke a contree to certayne lordes, In the southe one the see banke saile whene theme lykes. Thane bargez theme buskez, and to the bannke rowes, Bryngez blonkez one bourde, and burlyche helmes; Trussez in tristly trappyde stedes, Tentez, and othire toylez, and targez fulle ryche, Cabanes, and clathe-sekkes, and coferez fulle noble, Hukes, and haknays, and horsez of armez; Thus they stowe ine the stuffe of fulle steryne knyghtez. Qwene alle was schyppede that scholde, they schounte no lengere, Bot ventelde theme tyte, as the tyde rynnez; Coggez and crayers than crossez thaire mastez, At the commandment of the kynge, vncouerde at ones. Wyghtly one the wale thay wye vp thaire ankers, By wytt of the watyre-mene of the wale ythez, ffrekes one the forestayne fakene theire coblez, In floynes, and fercostez, and Flemesche schyppes, Tytt saillez to the toppe, and turnez the lufe, Standez appone stere-bourde, sterynly thay songene, The pryce schippez of the porte prouene theire depnesse, And fondez wyth fulle saile ower the fawe ythez; Holly with-owttyne harme thay hale in bottes, Schipe-mene scharply schotene thaire portez, Launchez lede apone lufe, lacchene ther depez, Lukkes to the lade-sterne, whene the lyghte faillez; Castez coursez be crafte, whene the clowde rysez, With the nedylle and the stone one the nyghte tydez; ffor drede of the derke nyghte thay drecchede a lyttille, And alle the steryne of the streme strekyne at onez. The kynge was in a gret cogge, with knyghtez fulle many, In a cabane enclosede, clenlyche arayede; With-in on a ryche bedde rystys a littylle, And with the swoghe of the see in swefnynge he felle. Hym dremyd of a dragone, dredfulle to be-holde, Come dryfande ouer the depe to drenschene hys pople, Ewene walkande owte of the weste landez, Wanderande vnworthyly ouere the wale ythez; Bothe his hede and hys hals ware halely alle ouer Oundyde of azure, enamelde fulle faire: His scoulders ware schalyde alle in clene syluere, Schreede ouer alle the schrympe with schrinkande poyntez; Hys wombe and hys wenges of wondyrfulle hewes, In meruaylous maylys he mountede fulle hye; Whayme that he towchede he was tynt for euer! Hys feete ware floreschede alle in fyne sabylle, And syche a vennymous flayre flowe fro his lyppez, That the flode of the flawez alle one fyre semyde! Thane come of the Oryente, ewyne hyme agaynez, A blake bustous bere abwene in the clowdes, With yche a pawe as a poste, and paumes fulle huge, With pykes fulle perilous, alle plyande thame semyde, Lothene and lothely, lokkes and other, Alle with lutterde legges, lokerde vnfaire, ffiltyrde vnfrely, wyth fomannde lyppez, The foulleste of fegure that fourmede was euer! He baltyrde, he bleryde, he braundyschte ther-after; To bataile he bounnez hym with bustous clowez: He romede, he rarede, that roggede alle the erthe! So ruydly he rappyd at to ryot hym seluene! Thane the dragone on dreghe dressede hyme a-?aynez, And with hys duttez hym drafe one dreghe by the walkyne: He fares as a fawcone, frekly he strykez; Bothe with feete and with fyre he feghttys at ones! The bere in the bataile the bygger hym semyde, And byttes hyme boldlye wyth balefulle tuskez; Syche buffetez he hym rechez with hys brode klokes, Hys brest and his brathelle whas blodye alle ouer! He rawmpyde so ruydly that alle the erthe ryfez, Rynnande one reede blode as rayne of the heuene! He hade weryede the worme by wyghtnesse of strenghte, Ne ware it fore the wylde fyre that he hyme wyth defendez. Thane wandyrs the worme awaye to hys heghttez, Commes glydande fro the clowddez, and cowpez fulle euene; Towchez hym wyth his talounez, and terez hys rigge, Be-twyx the taile and the toppe tene fote large! Thus he brittenyde the bere, and broghte hyme olyfe, Lette hyme falle in the flode, fleete whare hyme lykes: So they brynge the bolde kyng bynne the schippe-burde, That nere he bristez for bale, one bede whare he lyggez. Thane waknez the wyese kynge, wery fore-trauaillede, Takes hyme two phylozophirs, that folowede hyme euer, In the seuyne scyence the suteleste fondene, The cony[n]geste of clergye vndyre Criste knowene; He tolde theme of hys tourmente, that tyme that he slepede, “Drechede with a dragone, and syche a derfe beste, Has mad me fulle wery; ?e telle me my swefene, Ore I mone swelte as swythe, as wysse me oure Lorde!” “Sir,” saide they sone thane, thies sagge philosopherse, “The dragone that thow dremyde of, so dred fulle to schewe, That come dry fande ouer the deepe, to drynchene thy pople, Sothely and certayne thy seluene it es, That thus saillez ouer the see with thy sekyre knyghtez: The colurez that ware castyne appone his clere wengez, May be thy kyngry kezalle, that thow has ryghte wonnyne; And the tachesesede taile, with tonges so huge, Be-takyns this faire folke, that in thy fleet wendez. The bere that bryttenede was abowene in the clowdez, Be-takyns the tyrauntez that tourmentez thy pople; Or elles with somme gyaunt some journee salle happyne, In syngulere batelle by ?oure selfe one; And thow salle hafe the victorye thurghe helpe of oure Lorde, As thow in thy visione was opynly schewede! Of this dredfulle dreme ne drede the no more, Ne kare noghte, sir conquerour, bot comforth thy seluene; And thise that saillez ouer the see, with thy sekyre knyghtez.” With trumppez thene trystly, they trisene vpe thaire saillez, And rowes ouer the ryche see, this rowtte alle at onez; The comely coste of Normandye they cachene fulle euene, And blythely at Barflete theis bolde are arryfede, And fyndys a flete there of frendez ynewe, The floure and the faire folke of fyftene rewmez; ffore kyngez and capytaynez kepyde hyme fayre, As he at Carelele commaundyde at Cristymesse hym seluene. Be they had takene the lande, and tentez vpe rerede, Comez a templere tyte, and towchide to the kynge— “Here es a teraunt be-syde that tourmentez thi pople, A grett geaunte of geene, engenderde of fendez; He has fretyne of folke mo thane fyfe hondrethe, And als fele fawntekyns of freeborne childyre! This has bene his sustynaunce alle this seuene wyntteres, And ?itt es that sotte noghte sadde, so wele hyme it lykez! In the contree of Constantyne no kynde has he leuede, With-owttyne kydd castelles enclosid wyth walles, That he ne has clenly dystroyede alle the knaue childyre, And theme caryede to the cragge, and clenly deworyde! The duchez of Bretayne to daye has he takyne, Be-side Reynes as scho rade with hire ryche knyghttes; Ledd hyre to the mountayne, thare that lede lengez, To lye by that lady, aye whyls hir lyfe lastez. We folowede o ferrome moo thene fyfe hundrethe, Of beryns, and of burgeys, and bachelers noble, Bot he couerde the cragge; cho cryede so lowde, The care of that creatoure couer salle I neuer! Scho was flour of alle Fraunce, or of fyfe rewmes, And one of the fayreste that fourmede was euere, The gentileste jowelle a-juggede with lordes, ffro Geene vn-to Gerone, by Ihesu of heuene! Scho was thy wyfes cosyne, knowe it if the lykez, Comene of the rycheste, that rengnez in erthe: As thow arte ryghtwise kynge rewe on thy pople, And fande for to venge theme, that thus are rebuykyde!” “Allas!” sais sir Arthure, “so lange haue I lyffede, Hade I wytene of this, wele had me chefede; Me es noghte fallene faire, bot me es foule happynede, That thus this faire ladye this fende has dystroyede! I had leuere thane alle Fraunce, this fyftene wynter, I hade bene be-fore thate freke, a furlange of waye, Whene he that ladye had laghte and ledde to the montez: I hadde lefte my lyfe are cho hade harme lymppyde! Bot walde thow kene me to the crage, thare that kene lengez, I walde cayre to that coste, and carpe wythe hyme seluene, To trette with that tyraunt fore tresone of londes, And take trewe for a tyme, tille it may tyde bettyre.” “Sire, see ?e ?one farlande, with ?one two fyrez, Thar filsnez that fende, fraiste whene the lykes, Appone the creste of the cragge, by a colde welle, That enclosez the clyfe with the clere strandez, Ther may thow fynde folke fay wyth-owttyne nowmer, Mo florenez in faythe thane Fraunce es in aftyre; And more tresour vn-trewely that traytour has getyne, Thane in Troye was, as I trowe, that tyme that it was wonne.” Thane romyez the ryche kynge for rewthe of the pople, Raykez ryghte to a tente, and restez no lengere! He welterys, he wristeles, he wryngez hys handez! Thare was no wy of this werlde, that wyste whatt he menede! He calles sir Cayous that of the cowpe serfede, And sir Bedvere the bolde, that bare hys brande ryche,— “Luke ?e aftyre euensange be armyde at ryghttez, On blonkez by ?one buscayle, by ?one blythe stremez, ffore I wille passe in pilgremage preuely here-aftyre, In the tyme of suppere, whene lordez are servede, ffor to sekene a saynte be ?one salte stremes, In seynt Mighelle mount, there myraclez are schewede.” Aftyre euesange, sir Arthure hyme se[l]fene Wente to hys wardrope, and warpe of hys wedez, Armede hym in a actone with orfraeez fulle ryche, Abouen one that a jeryne of Acres owte ouer, Abouen that a jesseraunt of jentylle maylez, A jupone of Ierodyne jaggede in schredez; He brayedez one a bacenett burneschte of syluer, The beste that was in Basille, wyth bordurs ryche; The creste and the coronalle, enclosed so faire Wyth clasppis of clere golde, couched wyth stones; The vesare, the aventaile, enarmede so faire, Voyde with-owttyne vice, with wyndowes of syluer; His gloues gaylyche gilte, and grauene at the hemmez, With grayuez and gobelets, glorious of hewe; He bracez a brade schelde, and his brande aschez, Bounede hyme a broune stede, and one the bente houys; He sterte tille his sterepe and stridez one lofte, Streynez hyme stowttly, and sterys hyme faire, Brochez the baye stede, and to the buske rydez, And there hys knyghtes hyme kepede fulle clenlyche arayede. Thane they roode by that ryuer, that rynnyd so swythe, Thare the ryndez ouerrechez with realle bowghez; The roo and the rayne-dere reklesse thare ronnene, In ranez and in rosers to ryotte thame seluene; The frithez ware floreschte with flourez fulle many, Wyth fawcouns and fesantez of ferlyche hewez; Alle the feulez thare fleschez, that flyez with wengez, ffore thare galede the gowke one greuez fulle lowde, Wyth alkyne gladchipe thay gladdene theme seluene: Of the nyghtgale notez the noisez was swette, They threpide wyth the throstilles, thre hundreth at ones! That whate swowynge of watyre, and syngynge of byrdez, It myghte salue hyme of sore, that sounde was neuere! Thane ferkez this folke, and one fotte lyghttez, ffestenez theire faire stedez o ferrome by-twe?e; And thene the kynge kenely comandyde hys knyghtez ffor to byde with theire blonkez, and bowne no forthyre,— “ffore I wille seke this seynte by my selfe one, And melle with this mayster mane, that this monte ?emez; And seyne salle ?e offyre, aythyre aftyre other, Menskfully at Saynt Mighelle fulle myghtty with Criste!” The kyng coueris the cragge wyth cloughes fulle hye, To the creste of the clyffe he clymbez one lofte; Keste vpe hys vmbrere, and kenly he lukes, Caughte of the colde wynde to comforthe hym seluene; Two fyrez he fyndez fflawmande fulle hye, The fourtedele a furlange be-twene thus he walkes; The waye by the welle strandez he wandyrde hyme one, To wette of the warlawe, whare that he lengez; He ferkez to the fyrste fyre, and euene there he fyndez A wery wafulle wedowe, wryngande hire handez, And gretande on a graue grysely teres, Now merkyde one molde, sene myddaye it semede: He salu?ede that sorowfulle with sittande wordez, And fraynez aftyre the fe?de fairely there-aftyre. Thane this wafulle wyfe vn-wynly hym gretez, Couerde vp on hire kneesse, and clappyde hire handez; Said, “carefulle caremane, thow carpez to lowde! May ?one warlawe wyt, he worows vs alle! Weryd worthe the wyghte ay, that the thy wytt refede, That mase the to wayfe here in thise wylde lakes! I warne the fore wyrchipe, thou wylnez aftyr sorowe!

And thow my concelle doo, thow dosse of thy clothes, And knele in thy kyrtylle, and calle hym thy lorde. He sowppes alle this sesone with seuene knaue childre, Choppid in a chargour of chalke whytt syluer, With pekille and powdyre of precious spycez, And pyment fulle plenteuous of Portyngale wynes; Thre balefulle birdez his brochez they turne, That byddez his bedgatt, his byddynge to wyrche; Siche foure scholde be fay with-in foure hourez, Are his fylth ware fillede, that his flesch ?ernes.” “?a, I haue broghte the berde,” quod he, “the bettyre me lykez; ffor-thi wille I boune me, and bere it my seluene; Bot, lefe, walde thow lere me whare that lede lengez, I salle alowe the and I liffe, oure Lorde so me helpe!” “fferke fast to the fyre,” quod cho, “that flawmez so hye; Thare fillis that fende hyme, fraist whe?e the lykez; Bot thow moste seke more southe, sydlyngs a lyttille, ffor he wille hafe sent hym selfe sex myle large.” To the sowre of the reke he soghte at the gayneste, Sayned hyme sekerly with certeyne wordez, And sydlyngs of the segge the syghte had he rechide, How vn-semly that sott satt sowpande hym one; He lay lenand one lange, lugande vn-faire, The thee of a manns lymme lyfte vp by the haunche; His bakke, and his bewschers, and his brode lendez, He bekez by the bale-fyre, and breklesse hyme semede; Thare ware rostez fulle ruyde, and rewfulle bredez, Beerynes and bestaile brochede to-geders; Cowlefulle cramede of crysmede childyre, Sum as brede brochede, and bierdez thame tournede. And thane this comlych kynge, by-cause of his pople, His herte bledez for bale, one bent ware he standez! Thane he dressede one his schelde, schuntes no lengere, Braundesche his bryghte swerde by the bryghte hiltez, Raykez to-warde the renke reghte with a ruyde wille, And hyely hailsez that hulke with hawtayne wordez,— “Now, alle-weldand Gode, that wyrscheppez vs alle, Giff the sorowe and syte, sotte, there thow lygges, ffor the fulsomeste freke that fourmede was euere! ffoully thow fedys the, the fende haue thi saule!

Dresse the now, dogge-sone, the deuelle haue thi saule! ffor thow salle dye this day, thurghe dynt of my handez!” Thane glopnede the glotone and glorede vn-faire; He grennede as a grewhounde, with grysly tuskes; He gapede, he groned faste, with grucchande latez, ffor grefe of the gude kynge, that hyme with grame gretez! His fax and his foretoppe was filterede to-geders, And owte of his face fome ane halfe fote large; His frount and his forheuede, alle was it ouer, As the felle of a froske, and fraknede it semede, Huke-nebbyde as a hawke, and a hore berde, And herede to the hole eyghne with hyngande browes; Harske as a hunde-fisch, hardly who so lukez, So was the hyde of that hulke hally al ouer! Erne had he fulle huge, and vgly to schewe, With eghne fulle horreble, and ardauunt for sothe; fflatt-mowthede as a fluke, with fleryande lyppys, And the flesche in his fortethe fowly as a bere. His berde was brothy and blake, that tille his brest rechede, Grassede as a mereswyne with corkes fulle huge, And alle falterde the flesche in his foule lippys, Ilke wrethe as a wolfe-heuede, it wraythe owtt at ones! Bullenekkyde was that bierne, and brade in the scholders, Brok-brestede as a brawne, with brustils fulle large, Ruyd armes as an ake with rusclede sydes, Lyme and leskes fulle lothyne, leue ?e for sothe: Schouelle-fotede was that schalke, and schaylande hyme semyde, With schankez vn-schaply, schowande to-gedyrs; Thykke theese as a thursse, and thikkere in the hanche, Greesse growene as a galte, fulle grylych he lukez! Who the lenghe of the lede lelly accountes, ffro the face to the fote, was fyfe fadome lange! Thane stertez he vp sturdely one two styffe schankez, And sone he caughte hyme a clubb alle of clene yryne! He walde hafe kyllede the kynge with his kene wapene, Bot thurghe the crafte of Cryste ?it the carle failede; The creest and the coronalle, the claspes of syluer, Clenly with his clubb he crasschede doune at onez! The kynge castes vp his schelde, and couers hym faire, And with his burlyche brande a box he hyme reches; ffulle butt in the frunt the fromonde he hittez, That the burnyscht blade to the brayne rynnez; He feyede his fysnamye with his foule hondez, And frappez faste at hys face fersely ther-aftyre! The kyng chaungez his fote, eschewes a lyttille, Ne had he eschapede that choppe, cheuede had euylle; He folowes in fersly, and festenesse a dynte Hye vpe one the hanche, with his harde wapyne, That he hillid the swerde halfe a fote large; The hott blode of the hulke vn-to the hilte rynnez, Ewyne in-to jumette the gyaunt he hyttez, Iust to the genitales, and jaggede thame in sondre! Thane he romyede and rarede, and ruydly he strykez ffulle egerly at Arthure, and one the erthe hittez A swerde lenghe with-in the swarthe, he swappez at ones, That nere swounes the kynge for swoughe of his dynttez! Bot ?it the kynge sweperly fulle swythe he by-swenkez, Swappez in with the swerde that it the swange brystedde; Bothe the guttez and the gorre guschez owte at ones, That alle englaymez the gresse, one grounde ther he standez! Thane he castez the clubb, and the kynge hentez, On the creeste of the cragg he caughte hyme in armez, And enclosez hyme clenly, to cruschene hys rybbez; So harde haldez he that hende, that nere his herte brystez! Thane the balefulle bierdez bownez to the erthe, Kneland and cryande, and clappide theire handez,— “Criste comforthe ?one knyghte, and kepe hym fro sorowe, And latte neuer ?one fende felle hyme olyfe!” ?itt es the warlow so wyghte, he welters hyme vndere, Wrothely thai wrythyne and wrystille to-gederz, Welters and walowes ouer with-in thase buskez, Tumbellez and turnes faste, and terez thaire wedez, Vn-tenderly fro the toppe thai tiltine to-gederz; Whilome Arthure ouer, and other-while vndyre, ffro the heghe of the hylle vn-to the harde roche; They feyne neuer are they falle at the flode merkes; Bot Arthur with ane anlace egerly smyttez, And hittez euer in the hulke vp to the hiltez. The theeffe at the dede-thrawe so throly hyme thryngez, That three rybbys in his syde he thrystez in sundere! Thene sir Kayous the kene vn-to the kynge styrtez,— Said, “allas! we are lorne, my lorde es confundede, Ouer-fallene with a fende! vs es fulle hapnede! We mone be forfetede in faith, and flemyde for euer!” Thay hafe vp hys hawberke thane, and handilez thervndyre, His hyde and his haunche eke, one heghte to the schuldrez, His flawnke and his feletez, and his faire sydez, Bothe his bakke and his breste, and his bryghte armez. Thay ware fayne that they fande no flesche entamede, And for that journee made joye, thir gentille knyghttez. “Now, certez,” saise Sir Bedwere, “it semez, be my Lorde! He sekez seyntez bot seldene, the sorere he grypes, That thus clekys this corsaunt owte of thir heghe clyffez, To carye forthe siche a carle at close hym in siluere; Be Myghelle, of syche a makk I hafe myche wondyre That euer owre soueraygne Lorde suffers hyme in heuene; And alle seyntez be syche, that seruez oure Lorde, I salle neuer no seynt bee, be my fadyre sawle!” Thane bouredez the bolde kynge at Bedvere wordez,— “This seynt haue I soghte, so helpe me owre Lorde! ffor-thy brayd owtte thi brande, and broche hyme to the herte; Be sekere of this sergeaunt, he has me sore greuede! I faghte noghte wyth syche a freke this fyftene wyntyrs, Bot in the montez of Araby I mett syche another; He was the forcyere be ferre that had I nere fundene, Ne had my fortune bene faire, fey had I leuede! Onone stryke of his heuede, and stake it there-aftyre, Gife it to thy sqwyere, fore he es wele horsede; Bere it to sir Howelle, that es in harde bandez, And byd hyme herte hym wele, his enmy es destruede! Syne bere it to Bareflete, and brace it in yryne, And sett it on the barbycane, biernes to schewe. My brande and my brode schelde apone the bent lyggez, On the creeste of the cragge, thare fyrste we encontrede, And the clubb thar-by, alle of clene irene, That many Cristene has kyllyde in Constantyne landez; fferke to the farlande, and fetche me that wapene, And late founde tille oure flete, in flode thare it lengez. If thow wylle any tresour, take whate the lykez; Haue I the kyrtylle and the clubb, I coueite noghte elles!” Now they caire to the cragge, thise comlyche knyghtez, And broghte hyme the brade schelde, and his bryghte wapene, The clubb and the cotte alls, Syr Kayous hym seluene, And kayres with conquerour, the kyngez to schewe; That in couerte the kynge helde closse to hym seluene, Whilles clene day fro the clowde clymbyd on lofte. Be that to courte was comene clamour fulle huge, And be-fore the comlyche kynge they knelyd alle at ones,— “Welcome, oure liege lorde, to lang has thow duellyde!

Qwen Sir Arthur the kynge had kylled the gyaunt, Than blythely fro Bareflete he buskes one the morne, With his batelle one brede, by tha blythe stremes; To-warde Castelle Blanke he chesez hym the waye, Thurghe a faire champayne, vndyr schalke hyllis; The kyng fraystez a furth ouer the fresche strandez, ffoundez with his faire folke ouer as hym lykez: ffurthe stepes that steryne, and strekez his tentis One a strenghe by a streme, in thas straytt landez.

I had leuer thene alle Fraunce, that heuede es of rewmes, ffyghte with the faythefully one felde be oure one.” Thane answers sir Gayous fulle gobbede wordes,— Was eme to the emperour, and erle hyme selfene,— “Euere ware thes Bretouns braggers of olde! Loo! how he brawles hyme for hys bryghte wedes, As he myghte bryttyne vs alle with his brande ryche! ?itt he berkes myche boste, ?one boy there he standes!” Thane greuyde sir Gawayne at his grett wordes, Graythes to-warde the gome with grucchande herte; With hys stelyne brande he strykes of hys heuede, And sterttes owtte to hys stede, and with his stale wendes! Thurghe the wacches they wente, thes wirchipfulle knyghtez, And fyndez in theire fare-waye wondyrlyche many; Ouer the watyre they wente by wyghtnesse of horses, And tuke wynde as they walde by the wodde hemmes. Thane folous frekly one fote frekkes ynewe, And of the Romayns arrayed appone ryche stedes, Chasede thurghe a champayne oure cheualrous knyghtez, Tille a cheefe forest, one schalke whitte horses. Bot a freke alle in fyne golde, and fretted in salle, Come forthermaste on a fresone, in flawmande wedes; A faire floreschte spere in fewtyre he castes, And folowes faste one owre folke, and freschelye ascryez, Thane sir Gawayne the gude appone a graye stede, He gryppes hym a grete spere, and graythely hyme hittez; Thurghe the guttez in-to the gorre he gyrdes hyme ewyne, That the groundene stele glydez to his herte!

And he bryngez furthe the blade, and bownez to his felowez.

Than a ryche mane of Rome relyede to his byerns,— “It salle repent vs fulle sore and we ryde forthire! ?one are bolde bosturs, that syche bale wyrkez; It be-felle hym fulle foule, that thame so fyrste namede.” Thane the riche Romayns retournes thaire brydilles To thaire tentis in tene, telles theire lordez How sir Marschalle de Mowne es on the monte lefede, ffore-justyde at that journee, for his grett japez. Bot thare chasez one oure mene cheuallrous knyghtez, ffyfe thosande folke appone faire stedes, ffaste to a foreste ouer a felle watyr, That fillez fro the falow see fyfty myle large. Thare ware Bretons enbuschide, and banarettez noble, Of the cheualrye cheefe of the kyngez chambyre, Seese theme chase oure mene, and changene theire horsez, And choppe doune cheftaynes, that they moste chargyde. Thane the enbuschement of Bretons brake owte at ones, Brothely at banere, and Bedwyne knyghtez, Arrestede of the Romayns, that by the fyrthe rydez, Alle the realeste renkes that to Rome lengez; Thay iche on the enmyse and egerly strykkys, Erles of Inglande, and “Arthure!” ascryes, Thrughe brenes and bryghte scheldez, brestez they thyrle, Bretons of the boldeste with theire bryghte swerdez. Thare was Romayns ouer-redyne, and ruydly wondyde, Arrestede as rebawdez, with ryotous knyghttez! The Romaynes owte of araye remouede at ones, And rydes awaye in a rowtte, for reddoure it semys! To the senatour Petyr a sandes-mane es commyne, And saide, “sir, sekyrly, ?our seggez are supprysside!” Than tene thowsande mene he semblede at ones, And sett sodanly one oure seggez, by the salte strandez; Than ware Bretons abaiste, and greuede a lyttille, Bot ?it the banerettez bolde, and bachellers noble, Brekes that battailles with brestez of stedes; Sir Boice and his bolde mene myche bale wyrkes!

Thane sais sir Gawayne, “so me God helpe! We hafe bene chased to daye, and chullede as hares, Rebuyked with Romaynes appone theire ryche stedez, And we lurkede vndyr lee as lowrande wreches! I luke neuer one my lorde the dayes of my lyfe, And we so lytherly hyme helpe, that hyme so wele lykede!” Thane the Bretons brothely brochez theire stedez, And boldly in batelle appone the bent rydes; Alle the ferse mene be-fore frekly ascryes, fferkand in the foreste, to freschene thame selfene. The Romaynes thane redyly arrayes theme bettyre, One rawe on a rowm felde, reghttez theire wapyns, By the ryche reuare, and rewles the pople; And with reddour sir Boice es in areste haldene. Now thei semblede vnsaughte by the salte strandez; Saddly theis sekere menn settys theire dynttez, With lufly launcez one lofte they luyschene to-gedyres, In Lorayne so lordlye on leppande stedes. Thare ware gomes thurghe-girde with grundyne wapynes, Grisely gayspande with grucchande lotes! Grete lordes of Greke greffede so hye; Swyftly with swerdes, they swappene there-aftyre, Swappez doune ffulle sweperlye swelltande knyghtez, That alle swellttez one swarthe, that they ouer-swyngene, So many sweys in swoghe swounande att ones!

Sende owte sadly certayne knyghttez, Or say me sekerly sothe, for-sake ?if ?owe lykes.” Thane sais the kynge of Surry, “Alls saue me oure Lorde! ?if thow hufe alle the daye, thou bees noghte delyuerede, Bot thow sekerly ensure with certeyne knyghtez, That thi cote and thi breste be knawene with lordez, Of armes of ancestrye, entyrde with londez.” “Sir kyng,” sais sir Clegys, “fulle knyghttly thow askez: I trowe it be for cowardys thow carpes thes wordez: Myne armez are of ancestrye enueryde with lordez, And has in banere bene borne sene sir Brut tyme; At the cité of Troye that tymme was ensegede, Ofte seene in asawtte with certayne knyghttez, ffro the Borghte broghte vs and alle oure bolde elders, To Bretayne the braddere, with-in chippe-burdez.” “Sir,” sais sir Sextenour, “saye what the lykez, And we salle suffyre the, als vs beste semes; Luke thi troumppez be trussede, and trofulle no lengere, ffor thoghe thou tarye alle the daye, the tyddes no bettyr! ffor there salle neuer Romayne, that in my rowtt rydez, Be with rebawdez rebuykyde, whills I in werlde regne!” Thane sir Clegis to the kynge a lyttille enclinede, Kayres to sir Cadore, and knyghtly hym tellez,— “We hafe foundene in ?one firthe, floreschede with leues, The flour of the faireste folke that to thi foo langez, ffifty thosandez of folke of ferse mene of armez, That faire are fewteride on frounte vndyr ?one fre bowes; They are enbuschede one blonkkes, with baners displayede, In ?one bechene wode appone the waye sydes. Thay hafe the furthe for-sette alle of the faire watyre, That fayfully of force feghte vs byhowys; ffor thus vs schappes to daye, schortly to telle, Whedyre we schone or schewe, schyft as the lykes.” “Nay,” quod Cador, “so me Criste helpe! It ware schame that we scholde schone for so lytylle! Sir Lancelott salle neuer laughe, that with the kyng lengez, That I sulde lette my waye for lede appone erthe; I salle be dede and vndone ar I here dreche, ffor drede of any doggesone in ?one dyme schawes!” Syr Cador thane knyghtly comforthes his pople, And with corage kene he karpes thes wordes,— “Thynk one the valyaunt prynce that vesettez vs euer, With landez and lordcheppez, whare vs beste lykes; That has vs ducherés delte, and dubbyde vs knyghttez, Gifene vs gersoms and golde, and gardwynes many, Grewhoundez and grett horse, and alkyne gamnes, That gaynez tille any gome, that vndyre God leuez; Thynke one riche renoune of the Rounde Table, And late it neuer be refte vs fore Romayne in erthe; ffeyne ?ow noghte feyntly, ne frythes no wapyns, Bot luke ?e fyghte faythefully, frekes ?our selfene; I walde be wellyde alle qwyke, and quarterde in sondre, Bot I wyrke my dede, whils I in wrethe lenge.” Than this doughtty duke dubbyd his knyghttez, Ioneke and Askanere, Aladuke and other, That ayerez were of Esexe, and alle thase este marchez; Howelle and Hardelfe, happy in armez, Sir Herylle and sir Herygalle, thise harageouse knyghttez. Than the souerayne assignede certayne lordez, Sir Wawayne, sir Vryelle, sir Bedwere the ryche, Raynallde and Richeere, and Rowlandez childyre,— “Takez kepe one this prynce with ?oure price knyghtez, And ?ife we in the stour withstondene the better, Standez here in this stede, and stirrez no forthire; And ?if the chaunce falle that we bee ouer-charggede, Eschewes to some castelle, and chewyse ?our selfene; Or ryde to the riche kynge ?if ?ow roo happyne, And bidde hym come redily to rescewe hys biernez.” And than the Bretons brothely enbrassez theire scheldez, Braydez one bacenetez, and buskes theire launcez. Thus he fittez his folke, and to the felde rydez, ffif hundreth one a frounte fewtrede at onez! With trompes thay trine, and trappede stedes, With cornettes and clarions, and clergialle notes; Schokkes in with a schakke, and schontez no langere, There schawes ware scheene vndyr the schire eynez. And thane the Romaynez rowtte remowes a lyttille, Raykes with a rerewarde thas realle knyghttez; So raply thay ryde thare, that alle the rowte ryngez, Of ryues and rannke stele, and ryche golde maylez. Thane schotte owtte of the schawe schiltrounis many, With scharpe wapynns of were schotande at ones: The kynge of Lebe be-fore the wawarde he ledez, And alle his lele lige mene o laundone ascriez. Thane this cruelle kynge castis in fewtire, Kaghte hym a couerde horse, and his course haldez, Beris to sir Berille, and brathely hym hittes, Throwghe golet and gorgere he hurtez hym ewyne! The gome and the grette horse at the grounde liggez, And gretez graythely to Gode, and gyffes hym the saule! Thus es Berelle the bolde broghte owtte of lyue, And byddez aftyre beryelle, that hym beste lykez. And thane sir Cador of Cornewayle es carefulle in herte, Be-cause of his kynyse-mane, that thus es myscaryede; Vmbeclappes the cors, and kyssez hyme ofte, Gerte kepe hym couerte with his clere knyghttez. Thane laughes the Lebe kynge, and alleon lowde meles,— “?one lorde es lyghttede! me lykes the bettyre! He salle noghte dere vs to daye, the deuylle haue [his] bones!” “?one kynge,” said Cador, “karpes fulle large, Be-cause he killyd this kene; Criste hafe thi saule! He salle hafe corne bote, so me Criste helpe! Or I kaire of this coste, we salle encontre ones! So may the wynde weile turnne, I quytte hym or ewyne, Sothely hym selfene, or summ of his ferez!” Thane sir Cador the kene knyghttly he wyrkez, Cryez, “A! Cornewale,” and castez in fewtere, Girdez streke thourghe the stour on a stede ryche! Many steryne mane he steride by strenghe of hyme one! Whene his spere was sprongene, he spede hym fulle ?erne, Swappede owtte with a swerde, that swykede hym neuer, Wroghte wayes fulle wyde, and wounded knyghttez; Wyrkez his ine wayfare fulle werkand sydez, And hewes of the hardieste halsez in sondyre, That alle blendez with blode thare his blanke rynnez! So many biernez the bolde broughte owt of lyfe, Tittez tirauntez doune, and temez theire sadilles, And turnez owte of the toile, whene hym tyme thynkkez! Thane the Lebe kynge criez fulle lowde One sir Cador the kene, with cruelle wordez, “Thowe hase wyrchipe wonne, and wondyde knyghttez! Thowe wenes fore thi wightenez the werlde es thy nowene! I salle wayte at thyne honnde, wy, be my trowthe! I haue warnede the wele, be ware ?if the lykez!” With cornuse and clariones theis newe made knyghttez Lythes vn-to the crye, and castez in fewtire; fferkes in one a ffrounte one fferaunte stedez, ffellede at the fyrste come fyfty att ones! Schotte thorowe the schiltrouns, and scheuerede launcez, Laid doune in the lumppe lordly biernez! And thus nobilly oure newe mene notez theire strenghez. Bot new notte es onone that noyes me sore. The kynge of Lebe has laughte a stede that hym lykede, And comes in lordely in lyonez of siluere, Vmbelappez the lumpe, and lattes in sondre; Many lede with his launce the liffe has he refede! Thus he chaces the childire of the kyngez chambire, And killez in the champanyse cheualrous knyghttez! With a chasynge spere he choppes doune many! Thare was sir Alyduke slayne, and Achinour wondyde, Sir Origge and sir Ermyngalle hewene al to pecez! And ther was Lewlyne laughte, and Lewlyns brothire, With lordez of Lebe, and lede to theire strenghez: Ne hade sir Clegis comene, and Clemente the noble, Oure newe mene hade gone to noghte, and many ma other. Thane sir Cador the kene castez in fewtire A cruelle launce and a kene, and to the kynge rydez, Hittez hym heghe one the helme with his harde wapene, That alle the hotte blode of hym to his hande rynnez! The hethene harageous kynge appone the hethe lyggez, And of his hertly hurte helyde he neuer! Thane sir Cador the kene cryez fulle lowde,— “Thow has corne botte, sir kynge, thare God gyfe the sorowe, Thow killyde my cosyne, my kare es the lesse! Kele the nowe in the claye, and comforthe thi selfene! Thow skornede vs lang ere with thi skornefulle wordez, And nowe has thow cheuede soo; it es thyne awene skathe! Holde at thow hente has, it harmez bot lyttille, ffor hethynge es hame holde, vse it who so wille.” The kyng of Surry thane es sorowfulle in herte, fforsake of this souerayg?e, that thus was supprissede; Semblede his Sarazenes, and senatours manye: Vnsaughtyly they sette thane apponeoure sere knyghttez; Sir Cador of Cornewaile he cownterez theme sone, With his kydde companye clenlyche arrayede; In the frount of the fyrthe, as the waye forthis, ffyfty thosande of folke was fellide at ones! Thare was at the assemblé certayne knyghttez, Sore wondede sone appone sere halfes; The sekereste Sarzanez that to that sorte lengede, Be-hynde the sadylles ware sette sex fotte large; They scherde in the schiltrone scheldyde knyghttez, Schalkes they schotte thrughe schrenkande maylez, Thurghe brenys browdene brestez they thirllede, Brasers burnyste bristez in sondyre; Blasons blode and blankes they hewene, With brandez of browne stele brankkand stedez! The Bretones brothely brittenez so many, The bente and the brode felde alle one blode rynnys! Be thane sir Cayous the kene a capitayne has wonnene, Sir Clegis clynges in, and clekes another; The capitayne of Cordewa, vndire the kynge selfene, That was keye of the kythe of alle that coste ryche, Vtolfe and Ewandre, Ioneke had nommene, With the erle of Affryke and other grette lordes. The kynge of Surry the kene to sir Cador es ?eldene, The synechalle of Sotere to Segramoure hym selfene. When the cheualrye saw theire cheftanes were nommene, To a cheefe foreste they chesene theire wayes, And felede theme so feynte, they falle in the greues, In the ferynne of the fyrthe, fore ferde of oure pople. Thare myght mene see the ryche ryde in the schawes, To rype vpe the Romaynez ruydlyche wondyde, Schowttes aftyre mene, harageous knyghttez, Be hunndrethez they hewede doune be the holte eynys! Thus oure cheualrous mene chasez the pople; To a castelle they eschewede a fewe that eschappede. Thane relyez the renkez of the Rounde Table, ffor to ryotte the wode, ther the duke restez; Ransakes the ryndez alle, raughte vp theire feres, That in the fightynge be-fore fay ware by-leuyde. Sir Cador garte chare theym, and couere theme faire, Kariede theme to the kynge with his beste knyghttez; And passez vn-to Paresche with presoners hym selfene, Be-toke theyme the proueste, pryncez and other; Tase a sope in the toure, and taryez no langere, Bot tournes tytte to the kynge, and hym wyth tunge telles. “Syr,” sais sir Cador, “a caas es be-fallene; We hafe cownterede to day, in ?one coste ryche With kyngez and kayseres, krouelle and noble, And knyghtes and kene men clenlych arayede! Thay hade at ?one foreste forsette vs the wayes, At the furthe in the fyrthe, with ferse mene of armes; Thare faughtte we in faythe, and foynede with sperys, One felde with thy foo-mene, and fellyd theme on lyfe. The kynge of Lebe es laide, and in the felde leuyde, And manye of his lege mene that yare to hym langede! Other lordez are laughte of vncouthe ledes; We hafe lede them at lenge, to lyf whilles the lykez. Sir Vtere and sir Ewaynedyre, theis honourable knyghttez, Be a nawntere of armes Ioneke has nommene, With erlez of the Oryentte, and austerene knyghttez, Of awncestrye the beste mene that to the oste langede; The senatour Barouns es kaughte with a knyghtte, The capitayne of Cornette, that crewelle es haldene, The syneschalle of Sutere vnsaughte wyth thes other, The kynge of Surry hym selfene, and Sarazenes. Bot fay of ours in the felde a fourtene knyghttez, I willenoghte feynene forbere, bot faythfully tellene; Sir Berelle es one, a banerette noble, Was killyde at the fyrste come with a kynge ryche; Sir Alidoyke of Towelle, with his tende knyghtez, Emange the Turkys was tynte, and in tyme fondene; Gude sir Mawrelle of Mauncez, and Mawrene his brother, Sir Meneduke of Mentoche, with meruailous knyghttez.” Thane the worthy kynge wrythes, and wepede with his eghne, Karpes to his cosyne sir Cador theis wordez,— “Sir Cador, thi corage confundez vs alle! Kowardely thow castez owtte alle my beste knyghttez! To putte mene in perille, it es no pryce holdene, Bot the partyes ware puruayede, and powere arayede; When they ware stade on a strenghe, thou sulde hafe with-stondene, Bot ?if thowe wolde alle my steryne stroye fore the nonys!” “Sir,” sais sir Cador, “?e knowe wele ?our selfene; ?e are kynge in this kythe, karpe whatte ?ow lykys! Salle neuer vpbrayde me, that to thi burde langes, That I sulde blyne fore theire boste, thi byddynge to wyrche; Whene any stirttez to stale, stuffe thame the bettere, Ore thei wille be stonayede, and stroyede in ?one strayte londez. I dide my delygens to daye, I doo me one lordez, And in daungere of dede fore dyuerse knyghttez, I hafe no grace to thi gree, bot syche grett wordez; ?if I heuen my herte, my hape es no bettyre.” ?ofe sir Arthure ware angerde, he ansuers faire, “Thow has doughttily donne, sir duke, with thi handez, And has donne thy deuer with my dere knyghttez; ffor-thy thow arte demyde, with dukes and erlez, ffor one of the doughtyeste that dubbede was euer! Thare es none ischewe of vs, on this erthe sprongene; Thow arte apparant to be ayere, are one of thi childyre; Thow arte my sister sone, for-sake salle I neuer!” Thane gerte he in his awene tente a table be sette, And tryede in with tromppez trauaillede biernez; Serfede them solempnely with selkouthe metez, Swythe semly in syghte with syluerene dischees. Whene the senatours harde saye that it so happenede, They saide to the emperour, “thi seggez are suppryssede! Sir Arthure, thyne enmy has owterayede thi lordez, That rode for the rescowe of ?one riche knyghttez! Thow dosse bot tynnez thi tyme, and turmenttez thi pople; Thow arte be-trayede of thi mene, that moste thow on traystede. That schalle turne the to tene and torfere for euer.” Than the emperour irus was angerde at his herte, ffor oure valyant biernez siche prowesche had wonnene. With kynge and with kaysere to consayle they wende, Souerayngez of Sarazenez, and senatours manye; Thus he semblez fulle sone certayne lordez, And in the assemble thane he sais them theis wordez,— “My herte sothely es sette, assente ?if ?owe lykes, To seke in-to Sexone, with my sekyre knyghttez, To fyghte with my foo-mene, if fortune me happene, ?if I may fynde the freke with-in the foure haluez; Or entire in-to Awguste awnters to seke, And byde with my balde mene with-in the burghe ryche; Riste vs and reuelle, and ryotte oure selfene, Lende thare in delytte in lordechippez ynewe, To sir Leo be comene with alle his lele knyghtez, With lordez of Lumberdye, to lette hyme the wayes.” Bot owre wyese kyng es warre to wayttene his renkes, And wyesly by the woddez voydez his oste; Gerte felschene his fyrez, flawmande fulle heghe, Trussene fulle traystely, and treunt there-aftyre. Sethene in-to Sessoyne, he soughte at the gayneste, And at the surs of the sonne disseuerez his knyghttez: fforsette theme the cité appone sere halfez, So-daynly on iche halfe, with seuene grett stales. Anely in the vale a vawewarde enbusches; Sir Valyant of Vyleris, with valyant knyghttez, Be-fore the kyngez visage made siche avowez, To venquyse by victorie the vescownte of Rome! ffor-thi the kynge chargez hym, what chaunce so be-falle, Cheftayne of the cheekke, with cheualrous knyghttez, And sythyne meles with mouthe, that he moste traistez; Demenys the medylwarde menskfully hyme selfene, ffittes his fote-mene, alls hym faire thynkkes; On frounte in the fore breste, the flour of his knyghtez, His archers on aythere halfe he ordaynede ther-aftyre To schake in a sheltro?e, to schotte whene thame lykez; He arrayed in the rerewarde fulle rialle knyghtez, With renkkes renownnd of the Rounde Table, Sir Raynalde, sir Richere, that rade was neuer, The riche duke of Rowne wyt[h] ryders ynewe; Sir Cayous, sir Clegis, and clene mene of armes, The kyng castes to kepe be thaa clere strandes. Sir Lott and sir Launcelotte, thise lordly knyghttez, Salle lenge on his lefte hande, wyth legyones ynewe, To meue in the morne-while, ?if the myste happynne; Sir Cador of Cornewaile, and his kene knyghtez, To kepe at the karfuke, to close in ther othere: He plantez in siche placez pryncez and erlez, That no powere sulde passe be no preué wayes. Bot the emperour onone, with honourable knyghtez And erlez, enteres the vale, awnters to seke, And fyndez sir Arthure with hostez arayede; And at his in-come, to ekkene his sorowe, Oure burlyche bolde kynge appone the bente howes, With his bataile one brede, and baners displayede. He hade the ceté for-sett appone sere halfes, Bothe the clewez and the clyfez with clene mene of armez! The mosse and the marrasse, the mounttez so hye, With gret multytude of mene, to marre hym in the wayes. Whene sir Lucius sees, he sais to his lordez, “This traytour has treunt this tresone to wyrche! He has the ceté forsett appone sere halfez, Alle the clewez and the cleyffez with clene mene of armez! Here es no waye i-wys, ne no wytt elles, Bot feghte with oure foo-mene, for flee may we neuer! Thane this ryche mane rathe arayes his byernez, Rewlede his Romaynez, and realle knyghtez; Buschez in the avawmewarde the vescounte of Rome, ffro Viterbe to Venyse, theis valyante knyghtez: Dresses vp dredfully the dragone of golde, With egles alouer, enamelede of sable; Drawene dreghely the wyne, and drynkyne thare-aftyre, Dukkez and dusseperez, dubbede knyghtez, ffor dauncesynge of Duche-mene, and dynnynge of pypez, Alle dynned fore dyne that in the dale houede. And thane sir Lucius on lowde said lordlyche wordez, “Thynke one the myche renownne of ?our ryche fadyrs; And the riatours of Rome, that regnede with lordez; And the renkez ouer-rane alle that regnede in erthe, Encrochede alle Cristyndome be craftes of armes; In eueriche a viage the victorie was haldene; In sette alle the Sarazenes with-in seuene wyntter, The parte ffro the porte Iaffe to Paradyse ?atez! Thoghe a rewme be rebelle, we rekke it bot lyttille! It es resone and righte the renke be restreynede! Do dresse we thare-fore, and byde we no langere, ffore dredlesse with-owttyne dowtte, the daye schalle be ourez!” Whene theise wordez was saide, the Walsche kynge hym selfene Whas warre of this wyderwyne, that werrayede his knyghttez: Brothely in the vale with voyce he ascryez,— “Viscownte of Valewnce, enuyous of dedys, The vassallage of Viterbe to daye schalle be reuengede! Vnuenquiste for this place voyde schalle I neuer!” Thane the vyscownte valiante, with a uoyse noble, Auoyeddyde the avawewarde, enuerounde his horse; He drissede in a derfe schelde, endenttyd with sable, With a dragone engowschede, dredfulle to schewe, Deuorande a dolphyne with dolefulle lates, In seyne that oure soueraygne sulde be distroyede, And alle done of dawez with dynttez of swerddez; ffor thare es noghte bot dede thare the dragone es raissede! Thane the comlyche kynge castez in fewtyre, With a crewelle launce cowpez fulle euene A-bowne the spayre a spanne, emange the schortte rybbys, That the splent and the spleene on the spere lengez! The blode sprente owtte and sprede as the horse spryngez, And he sproulez fulle spakely, bot spekes he no more! And thus has sir Valyant haldene his a-vowez, And venqwyste the viscownte, thate victor was haldene! Thane sir Ewayne sir Fytz Vriene ffulle enkerlye rydez Onone to the emperour his egle to towche; Thrughe his brode bataile he buskes be-lyfe, Braydez owt his brande with a blyth chere, Reuerssede it redelye, and awaye rydys; fferkez in with the fewle in his faire handez, And ffittez in freely one frounte with his feris. Now buskez sir Launcelot, and braydez fulle euene To sir Lucius the lorde, and lothelye hyme hyttez; Thurghe pawnce and platez he percede the maylez, That the prowde penselle in his pawnche lengez! The hede haylede owtt be-hynde ane halfe fote large, Thurghe hawberke and hanche, with the harde wapyne! The stede and the steryne mane strykes to the grownde, Strake downe a standerde, and to his stale wendez! “Me lykez wele,” sais sir Loth, “?one lordez are delyuerede! The lott lengez nowe on me, with leue of my lorde: To day salle my name be laide, and my life aftyre, Bot some leppe fro the lyfe, that one ?one lawnde houez!” Thane strekez the steryne, and streynys his brydylle, Strykez in-to the stowre on a stede ryche, Enjoynede with a geaunt, and jaggede hym thorowe! Jolyly this gentille for-justede a-nother, Wroghte wayes fulle wyde, werrayande knyghtez, And wondes alle wathely, that in the waye stondez! ffyghttez with alle the ffrappe a furlange of waye, ffelled fele appone felde with his faire wapene, Venqwiste and has the victorie of valyaunt knyghtez, And alle enverounde the vale, and voyde whene hym likede!

So they scherenkene fore schotte of the scharppe arowes, That alle the scheltrone schonte, and schoderide at ones! Thane riche stedes rependez, and rasches one armes; The hale howndrethe one hye appone heyghe lygges, Bott ?itte the hathelieste on hy, haythene and other; Alle hoursches ouer hede harmes to wyrke. And alle theis geauntez be-fore, engenderide with fendez, Ioynez on sir Ienitalle, and gentille knyghtez, With clubbez of clene stele clenkkede in helmes, Craschede doune crestez, and craschede braynez; Kyllede cou[r]sers and couerde stedes, Choppode thurghe cheualers one chalke-whytte stedez. Was neuer stele ne stede myghte stande them a-?aynez, Bot stonays and strykez doune, that in the stale houys. Tille the conquerour come with his kene knyghttez, With crewelle contenaunce he cryede fulle lowde,— “I wende no Bretones walde bee basschede for so lyttille, And fore bare-legyde boyes, that one the bente houys!” He clekys owtte Collbrande fulle clenlyche burneschte, Graythes hyme to Golapas, that greuyde moste; Kuttes hyme euene by the knees clenly in sondyre. “Come downe,” quod the kynge, “and karpe to thy ferys! Thowe arte to hye by the halfe. I hete the in trouthe! Thow salle be handsomere in hye, with the helpe of my Lorde!” With that stelene brande he strake ofe his hede. Sterynly in that stoure he strykes a-nother. Thus he settez on seuene with his sekyre knyghttez: Whylles sexty ware seruede soo, ne sessede they neuer! And thus at the joynenyge the geauntez are distroyede, And at that journey for-justede with gentille lordez. Than the Romaynes, and the rennkkez of the Rounde Table, Rewles theme in arraye, rerewarde ande other, With wyghte wapynez of werre, thay wroghtene one helmes, Rittez with rannke stele fulle ryalle maylez; Bot they fitt theme fayre, thes frekk byernez, ffewters in freely one fferaunte stedes, ffoynes fulle felly with flyschande speris, ffretene of orfrayes feste appone scheldez. So fele fay es in fyghte appone the felde leuyde, That iche a furthe in the firthe of rede blode rynnys! By that swyftely one swarthe the swett es by-leuede, Swerdez swangene in two, sweltand knyghtez Lyes wyde opyne welterande one walopande stedez; Wondes of wale mene werkande sydys, ffacez feteled vn-faire in filterede lakes, Alle craysed for-trodyne with trappede stedez, The faireste fygured folde that fygurede was euer, Alls ferre alls a furlange, a thosande at ones! Be than the Romaynez ware rebuykyde a lyttille, With-drawes theyme drerely, and dreches no lengare; Oure prynce with his powere persewes theyme aftyre, Prekez one the proudeste with his price knyghttez. Sir Kayous, sir Clegis, with clene mene of armez, Enconters theme at the clyffe with clene mene of armes; ffyghttes faste in the fyrth, frythes no wapene, ffelled at the firste come fyfe hundrethe at ones! And when they fande theym foresett with oure fers knyghtez, ffewe mene agayne fele mot fyche theme bettyre; ffeghttez with alle the frappe, foynes with speres, And faughte with the frekkeste that to Fraunce langez. Bot sir Kayous the kene castis in fewtyre, Chasez one a coursere, and to a kynge rydys; With a launce of Lettowe he thirllez his sydez, That the lyuer and the lunggez on the launce lengez. The schafte sc[h]odyrde and schott in the schire byerne, And soughte thorowowte the schelde, and in the schalke rystez. Bot Kayous at the in-come was kepyd vn-fayre With a cowarde knyghte of the kythe ryche; At the turnynge that tym the traytoure hym hitte In thorowe the felettes, and in the flawnke aftyre, That the boustous launce the bewells attamede, That braste at the brawlynge, and brake in the myddys. Sir Kayous knewe wele, be that kyde wounde, That he was dede of the dynte, and done owte of lyfe. Than he raykes in arraye and one rawe rydez, One this ryalle his dede to reuenge; “Kepe the, cowarde,” and calles hym sone, Cleues hym wyth his clere brande clenliche in sondire! “Hadde thow wele delte thy dynt with thi handes, I hade for-geffene the my dede, be Crist now of hewyne!” He weyndes to the wyese kynge, and wynly hym gretes, “I am wathely woundide, waresche mone I neuer! Wirke nowe thi wirchipe, as the worlde askes, And brynge me to beryelle, byd I no more! Grete wele my ladye the qwene, ?ife the werlde happyne, And alle the burliche birdes that to hir boure lengez, And my worthily weife, that wrethide me neuer, Bid hire fore hir wyrchipe wirke for my saulle!” The kyngez confessour come, with Criste in his handes, ffor to comforthe the knyghte, kende hym the wordes. The knyghte coueride on his knees with a kaunt herte, And caughte his Creatoure that comfurthes vs alle! Thane remmes the riche kynge fore rewthe at his herte, Rydes in-to rowte his dede to reuenge; Presede in-to the plumpe, and with a prynce metes, That was ayere of Egipt in thos este marches; Cleues hym with Collbrande clenlyche in sondyre! He broches euene thorowe the byerne, and the sadille bristes, And at the bake of the blonke the bewelles entamede! Manly in his maly[n]coly he metes a-nother, The medille of that myghtty, that hym myche greuede; He merkes thurghe the maylez the myddes in sondyre, That the myddys of the mane on the mounte fallez, The tother halfe of the haunche on the horse leuyde. Of that hurte, alls I hope, heles he neuer! He schotte thorowe the schiltrouns with his scharpe wapene, Schalkez he schrede thurghe, and schrenkede maylez; Baneres he bare downne, bryttenede scheldes, Brothely with browne stele his brethe he thare wrekes; Wrothely he wryththis by wyghtnesse of strenghe, Woundes these whydyrewyns, werrayede knyghttes, Threppede thorowe the thykkys thryttene sythis, Thryngez throly in the thrange, and chis euene aftyre! Thane sir Gawayne the gude, with wyrchipfulle knyghttez, Wendez in the a-vawewarde be tha wodde hemmys; Was warre of sir Lucius, one launde there he houys, With lordez and ligge mene, that to hyme selfe lengede. Thane the emperour enkerly askes hym sonne, “What wille thow, Gawayne, wyrke with thi wapyne? I watte be thi wauerynge, thow willnez aftyre sorowe; I salle be wrokyne on thi wrethe, fore alle thi grete wordez?” He laughte owtte a lange swerde, and luyschede one ffaste, And sir Lyonelle in the launde, lordely hym strykes, Hittes hym on the hede, that the helme bristis; Hurttes his herne-pane an hannde-brede large! Thus he layes one the lumppe, and lordlye theme seruede, Wondide worthily wirchipfulle knyghttez! ffighttez with Flore?t that beste es of swerdez, Tille the fomande blode tille his fyste rynnes! Thane the Romayns releuyde, that are ware rebuykkyde, And alle to-rattys oure mene with theire riste horsses; ffore they see thaire cheftayne be chauffede so sore, They chasse and choppedoune oure cheualrous knyghttes! Sir Bedwere was borne thurghe, and his breste thyrllede, With a burlyche brannde, brode at the hiltes; The ryalle rannke stele to his herte rynnys, And he rusches to the erthe, rewthe es the more! Thane the conquerour tuke kepe, and come with his strenghes To reschewe the ryche mene of the Rounde Table, To owttraye the emperour, ?if auntire it schewe, Ewyne to the egle, and “Arthure!” askryes. The emperour thane egerly at Arthure he strykez, Awkwarde on the vmbrere, and egerly hym hittez! The nakyde swerde at the nese noyes hym sare, The blode of [the] bolde kynge ouer the breste rynnys, Beblede at the brode schelde and the bryghte mayles! Oure bolde kynge bowes the blonke be the bryghte brydylle, With his burlyche brande a buffette hym reches, Thourghe the brene and the breste with his bryghte wapyne, O-slante doune fro the slote he slyttes at ones! Thus endys the emperour of Arthure hondes, And alle his austeryne oste thare-ofe ware affrayede! Now they ferke to the fyrthe, a fewe that are leuede, ffor ferdnesse of oure folke, by the fresche strandez! The floure of oure ferse mene one fferant stedez ffolowes frekly on the frekes, thate ffrayede was neuer. Thane the kyde conquerour cryes fulle lowde,— “Cosyne of Cornewaile, take kepe to thi selfene, That no captayne be kepyde for none siluer, Or sir Kayous dede be cruelly vengede!” “Nay,” sais sir Cador, “so me Cryste helpe! Thare ne es kaysere ne kynge, that vndire Criste ryngnes, That I ne schalle kille colde dede be crafte of my handez!” Thare myghte mene see chiftaynes, on chalke whitte stedez, Choppe doune in the chaas cheualrye noble; Romaynes the rycheste and ryalle kynges, Braste with ranke stele theire rybbys in sondyre! Braynes fore-brustene thurghe burneste helmes, With brandez for-brittenede one brede in the laundez. They hewede doune haythenemene with hiltede swerdez, Be hole hundrethez on hye, by the holte eynyes! Thare myghte no siluer thaym saue, ne socoure theire lyues, Sowdane, ne Sarazene, ne senatour of Rome! Thane releuis the renkes of the Rounde Table, Be the riche reuare that rynnys so faire; Lugegez thaym luflye by tha lyghte strandez, Alle on lawe in the lawnde, thas lordlyche byernes. Thay kaire to the karyage, and tuke whate them likes, Kamelles and sekadrisses, and cofirs fulle riche, Hekes, and hakkenays, and horses of armes, Howsynge and herbergage of heythene kyngez; They drewe owt of dromondaries dyuerse lordes, Moyllez mylke whitte, and meruayllous bestez, Elfaydes, and arrabys, and olyfauntez noble, Ther are of the Oryent, with honourable kynges. Bot sir Arthure onone ayeres ther-aftyre Ewyne to the emperour, with honourable kyngis; Laughte hym vpe fulle louelyly with lordlyche knyghttez, And ledde hyme to the layere, thare the kyng lygges. Thane harawdez heghely, at heste of the lordes, Hunttes vpe the haythemene, that on heghte lygges, The Sowdane of Surry, and certayne kynges, Sexty of the cheefe senatours of Rome. Thane they bussches and bawmede thaire honourliche kyngis, Sewed theme in sendelle sexti-faulde aftire, Lappede them in lede, lesse that they schulde Chawnge or chawffe, ?if thay myghte escheffe; Closed in kystys clene vn-to Rome, With theire baners a-bowne, theire bagis there-vndyre, In whate countré thay kaire that knyghttes myghte knawe Iche kynge be his colours, in kyth whare [he] lengede.

They coupylde the kystys on kameles be-lyue, On asses and arrabyes, theis honourable kynges; The emperoure for honoure, alle by hym one, Euene appone ane olyfaunte, hys egle owtt ouere; Be-kende theme the captyfis, the kynge dide hyme selfene, And alle by-fore his kene mene karpede thees wordes,— “Here are the kystis,” quod the kynge, “kaire ouer the mownttez; Mette fulle monee that ?e haue mekylle ?ernede, The taxe and the trebutte of tene schore wynteres, That was tenefully tynte in tyme of oure elders. Saye to the senatoure, the ceté that ?emes, That I sende hyme the somme, assaye how hyme likes! Bott byde theme neuere be so bolde, whylles my bolde regnes, Efte for to brawlle theme for my brode landez, Ne to aske trybut ne taxe be nakyne tytle, Bot syche tresoure as this, whilles my tyme lastez.” Nowe they raike to Rome the redyeste wayes, Knylles in the Capatoylle, and comowns assembles, Souerayngez and senatours, the ceté that ?emes; Be-kende theme the caryage, kystis and other, Alls the conquerour comaunde with cruelle wordes. “We hafe trystily trayuellede this tributte to feche, The taxe and the trewage of fowre score wynteris, Of I[n]glande, of Irelande and alle thir owtt illes, That Arthure in the Occedente ocupyes att ones.

Eschappide there ne cheuallrye, ne cheftaynes nother, Bott choppede downne in the chasse, syche chawnse es be-fallene! We rede ?e store ?owe of stone, and stuffene ?our walles: ?ow wakkens wandrethe and werre; be ware, ?if ?ow lykes!” In the kalendez of Maye this caas es be-fallene: The roy ryalle renownde, with his Rownde Table, One the coste of Costantyne by the clere strandez, Has the Romaynes ryche rebuykede for euer! Whene he hade foughttene in Fraunce, and the felde wonnene, And fersely his foomene fellde owtte of lyfe, He bydes for the beryenge of his bolde knyghtez, That in batelle with brandez ware broughte owte of lyfe. He beryes at Bayone sir Bedwere the ryche; The cors of Kayone the kene at Came es be-leuefede, Koueride with a crystalle clenly alle ouer; His fadyre conqueride that kyth knyghtly with hondes. Seyne in Burgoyne he bade to bery mo knyghttez, Sir Berade and Bawdwyne, sir Bedwar the ryche, Gud sir Cador at Came, as his kynde askes. Thane sir Arthure onone, in the Auguste ther-aftyre, Enteres to Almayne wyth ostez arrayed; Lengez at Lusscheburghe, to lechene hys knyghttez, With his lele ligge mene, as lorde in his awene. And on Christofre daye a concelle he haldez, Withe kynges and kaysers, clerkkes and other, Comandez them kenely to caste alle theire wittys, How he may conquere by crafte the kythe that he claymes. Bot the conquerour kene, curtais and noble, Karpes in the concelle theys knyghtly wordez,— “Here esa knyghte in theis klenys, enclesside with hilles, That I haue cowayte to knawe, be-cause of his wordez, That es Lorayne the lele, I kepe noghte to layne; The lordchipe es louely, as ledes me telles. I wille that ducherye devyse, and dele as me lykes, And seyne dresse wyth the duke, if destyny suffre: The renke rebelle has bene vn-to my Rownde Table, Redy aye with Romaynes, and ryotte my landes! We salle rekkene fulle rathe, if resone so happene, Who has ryghte to that rente, by ryche Gode of heuene! Thane wille I by Lumbardye lykande to schawe, Sett lawe in the lande, that laste salle euer; The tyrauntez of Turkayne tempeste a littylle, Talke with the temperalle, whilles my tyme lastez; I gyffe my protteccione to alle the pope landez, My ryche penselle of pes my pople to schewe. It es a foly to offende oure fadyr vndire Gode, Owther Peter or Paule, tha postles of Rome. ?if we spare the spirituelle, we spede bot the bettire; Whills we haue for to speke, spille salle it neuer!” Now they spede at the spurres, with-owttyne speche more, To the marche of Meyes, theis manliche knyghtez, That es Lorrayne alofede, as Londone es here; Ceté of that seyn?owre, that soueraynge es holdene. The kyng ferkes furthe on a faire stede, With Ferrer and Ferawnte, and other foure knyghtez; A-bowte the ceté tha seuene, they soughte at the nextte, To seke theme a sekyre place to sett withe engeynes; Thane they beneyde in burghe bowes of vyse, Bekyrs at the bolde kynge with boustouse lates, Allblawsters at Arthure egerly schottes, ffor to hurte hyme or his horse with that hard wapene. The kynge schonte for no schotte, ne no schelde askys, Bot schewes hym scharpely in his schene wedys; Lenges alle at laysere, and lokes one the wallys, Whare they ware laweste the ledes to assaille. “Sir,” said sir fferrere, “a ffoly thowe wirkkes, Thus nakede in thy noblaye to neghe to the walles, Sengely in thy surcotte, this ceté to reche, And schewe the with-ine, there to schende vs alle. Hye vs hastylye heynne, or we mone fulle happene, ffor hitt they the or thy horse, it harmes for euer!” “Ife thow be ferde,” quod the kyng, “I rede thow ryde vttere, Lesse that they rywe the with theire rownnd wapyne!

Salle neuer harlotte haue happe, thorowe helpe of my Lorde, To kylle a corownde kynge with krysome enoynttede!” Thane come the herbariours, harageous knyghtez, The hale batelles one hye harrawnte ther-aftyre; And oure forreours ferse, appone fele halfes, Come flyeande be-fore one ferawnt stedes; fferkande in arraye theire ryalle knyghttez, The renkez renownde of the Rownnd Table. Alle the frekke mene of Fraunce folowede thare-aftyre, ffaire fittyde one frownte, and one the felde houys. Thane the schalkes scharpelye scheftys theire horsez, To schewene them semly in theire scheene wedes; Buskes in batayle with baners displayede, With brode scheldes enbrassede, and burlyche helmys, With penouns and penselles of ylke prynce armes, Appayrellde with perrye and precious stones. The lawnces with loraynes, and lemande scheldes, Lyghtenande as the leuenynge, and lemand al ouer. Thane the price mene prekes, and proues theire horsez, Satilles to the ceté, appone sere halfes; Enserches the subbarbes sadly thare-aftyre, Discoueris of schotte-mene, and skyrmys a lyttille; Skayres thaire skottefers, and theire skowtte-waches, Brittenes theire barrers with theire bryghte wapyns; Bett downe a barbycane, and the brygge wynnys. Ne hade the garnysone bene gude at the grete ?ates, Thay hade wonne that wone be theire awene strenghe! Thane with-drawes oure mene, and drisses theme bettyre, ffor dred of the drawe-brigge dasschede in sondre; Hyes to the harbergage, thare the kynge houys With his batelle one heghe, horsyde on stedys; Thane was the prynce puruayede, and theire places nommene, Pyghte pauyllyons of palle, and plattes in seegge. Thane lenge they lordly, as theme leefe thoghte, Waches in ylke warde, as to the werre falles, Settes vp sodaynly certayne engynes. One Sonondaye be the Soo?e has a flethe ?oldene. The kynge calles one Florente, that flour was of knyghttez,— “The Fraunche-me?e enfeblesches, ne farly me thynkkys! They are vn-fondyde folke in tha faire marches, ffor theme wantes the flesche and fude that theme lykes. Here are fforestez faire appone fele halues, And thedyre feemene are flede with freliche bestes! Thow salle foonde to the felle, and forraye the mountes; Sir fforawnt and sir Florydas salle folowe thi brydylle; Vs moste with some fresche mette refresche oure pople, That are feedde in the fyrthe with the froyte of the erthe. Thare salle weende to this viage sir Gawayne hym selfene, Wardayne fulle wyrchipfulle, and so hym wele semes; Sir Wecharde, sir Waltyre, theis wyrchipfulle knyghtes, With alle wyseste mene of the weste marches; Sir Clegis, sir Clarybalde, sir Clarymownde the noble, The capytayne of Cardyfe clenlyche arrayede. Goo now, warne alle the wache, Gawayne and other, And weendes furthe on ?our waye withowttyne moo wordes.” Now ferkes to the fyrthe thees fresche mene of armes, To the felle so fewe, theis fresclyche byernes, Thorowe hopes and hymlande hillys and other, Holtis and hare woddes with heslyne schawes, Thorowe marasse and mosse and montes so heghe; And in the myste mornynge one a mede falles, Mawene and vne-made, maynoyrede bott lyttylle, In swathes sweppene downe, fulle of swete floures. Thare vnbrydilles theis blode, and baytes theire horses, To the grygynge of the daye, that byrdez gane synge, Whylles the surs of the sonne, that sonde es of Cryste, That solaces alle synfulle, that syghte has in erthe. Thane weendes owtt the wardayne, sir Gawayne hyme selfene, Alls he that weysse was and wyghte, wondyrs to seke; Thane was he warre of a wye, wondyre wele armyde, Baytand one a wattire banke by the wodde eynis, Buskede in brenyes bryghte to be-halde, Enbrassede a brode schelde on a blonke ryche, With birenne ony borne, bot a boye one, Houes by hym on a blonke, and his spere holdes. He bare gessenande in golde, thre grayhondes of sable, With chapes a cheynes of chalke whytte syluer, A charebocle in the cheefe, chawngawnde of hewes, And a cheefe anterous, chalange who lykes. Sir Gawayne glyftes on the gome with a glade wille! A grete spere fro his grome he grypes in hondes, Gyrdes ewene ouere the streme one a stede ryche, To that steryne in stour, one strenghe thare he houys! Egerly one Inglisce “Arthure!” he askryes, The tother irouslye ansuers hym sone On a launde of Lorrayne with a lowde steuen, That ledes myghte lystene the lenghe of a myle! “Whedyr prykkes thow, pilouur, that profers so large? Here pykes thowe no praye, profire whene the lykes! Bot thow in this perelle put of the bettire, Thow salle be my presonere, for alle thy prowde lates!” “Sir,” sais sir Gawayne, “so me Gode helpe! Siche glauerande gomes greues me bot lyttille! Bot if thowe graythe thy gere, the wille grefe happene, Or thowe goo of this greue, for alle thy grete wordes!” Thane theire launces they lachene, thes lordlyche byernez, Laggene with longe speres one lyarde stedes; Cowpene at awntere be kraftes of armes, Tille bothe the crowelle speres broustene att ones! Thorowe scheldys they schotte, and scherde thorowe ma[i]les, Bothe schere thorowe schoulders a schaft-monde large! Thus worthylye thes wyes wondede ere bothene; Or they wreke theme of wrethe a-waye wille they neuer! Than they raughte in the reyne and a-gayne rydes, Redely theis rathe mene rusches owtte swerdez, Hittes one hellmes fulle hertelyche dynttys, Hewes appone hawberkes with fulle harde wapyns! ffulle stowttly they stryke, thire steryne knyghttes, Stokes at the stomake with stelyne poyntes, ffeghttene and floresche withe flawmande swerdez, Tille the flawes of fyre flawmes one theire helmes. Thane sir Gawayne was greuede, and grychgide fulle sore; With Galuthe his gude swerde grymlye he strykes! Clefe the knyghttes schelde clenliche in sondre! Who lukes to the lefte syde, whene his horse launches, With the lyghte of the sonne men myghte see his lyuere! Thane granes the gome fore greefe of his wondys, And gyrdis at sir Gawayne, as he by glentis; And awkewarde egerly sore he hym smyttes; An alet enamelde he oches in sondire, Bristes the rerebrace with the bronde ryche, Kerues of at the coutere with the clene egge, Ane[n]tis the avawmbrace, vrayllede with siluer! Thorowe a dowble vesture of veluett ryche, With the venymous swerde a vayne has he towchede! That voydes so violently that alle his witte changede! The vesere, the aventaile, his vesturis ryche, With the valyant blode was verrede alle ouer! Thane this tyrante tite turnes the brydille, Talkes vn-tendirly, and sais, “thow arte towchede! Vs bus haue a blode-bande, or thi ble change, ffor alle the barbours of Bretayne salle noghte thy blode stawnche! ffor he that es blemeste with this brade brande, blyne schalle he neuer.” “?a,” quod sir Gawayne, “thow greues me bot lyttille! Thowe wenys to glopyne me with thy gret wordez! Thow trowes with thy talkynge that my harte talmes! Thow be-tydes tourfere or thowe hyene turne, Bot thow telle me tytte, and tarye no lengere, What may staunche this blode that thus faste rynnes.” “?ise, I say the sothely, and sekire the my trowthe, No surgyone in Salarne salle saue the bettyre; With-thy that thowe suffre me, for sake of thy Cryste, To schewe schortly my schrifte, and schape for myne ende.” “?is,” quod sir Gawayne, “so me God helpe!

Tak heede to this hansemane, that he no horne blawe, Are thowe heyly in haste beese hewene al to peces; ffor they are my retenuz to ryde whare I wylle, Es none redyare renkes regnande in erthe; Be thow raghte with that rowtt, thow rydes no forther, Ne thow bees neuer rawnsonede for reches in erthe!” Sir Gawayne wente or the wathe come, whare hym beste lykede, With this wortheliche wye, that wondyd was sore; Merkes to the mountayne there oure mene lenges, Baytaynde theire blonkes ther on the brode mede; Lordes lenande lowe one lemande scheldes, With lowde laghttirs one lofte for lykynge of byrdez, Of larkes, of lynkwhyttez, that lufflyche songene, And some was sleghte one slepe with slaughte of the pople, That sange in the sesone in the schenne schawes, So lawe in the lawndez so lykande notes. Thane sir Whycher whas warre thaire wardayne was wondyde, And went to hym wepand, and wryngande his handes; Sir Wychere, sir Walchere, theis weise mene of armes, Had wondyre of sir Gawayne, and wente hyme a-gayns, Mett hym in the mydwaye, and meruaile theme t[h]oghte How he maisterede that mane, so myghtty of strenghes! Be alle the welthe of the werlde, so woo was theme neuer! “ffor alle oure wirchipe i-wysse awaye es in erthe!” “Greue ?ow noghte,” quod Gawayne, “for Godis luffe of heuene; ffore this es bot gosesomere, and gyffene one erles; Thoffe my schouldire be schrede, and my schelde thyrllede, And the wielde of myne arme werkkes a littille, This prissonere sir Priamus, that has perilous wondes, Sais that he has saluez salle softene vs bothene.” Thane stirttes to his sterape sterynfulle knyghttez, And he lordely lyghttes and laghte of his brydille, And lete his burlyche blonke baite on the flores; Braydes of his bacenette and his ryche wedis, Bownnes to his brode schelde and bowes to the erthe, In alle the bodye of that bolde es no blode leuede! Than preses to sir Priamous precious knyghtes, Auyssely of his horse hentes hym in armes; His helme and his hawberke thay takene of aftyre, And hastily for his hurtte alle his herte chawngyd; They laide hyme downe in the lawndez, and laghte of his wedes, And he lenede hym one lange, or how hym beste lykede. A ffoyle of fyne golde they fande at his gyrdille, That es fulle of the flour of the fouur welle, That flowes owte of Paradice whene the flode ryses, That myche froyt of fallez, that feede schalle vs alle; Be it frette on his flesche, thare synues are entamede, The freke schalle be fische halle with-in fowre howres. They vncouere that cors with fulle clene hondes; With clere watire a knyghte clensis theire wondes, Keled theyme kyndly, and comforthed ther hertes. And whene the carffes ware clene, thay clede them a?ayne; Barelle ferrers they brochede, and broghte theme the wyne, Bothe brede and brawne, and bredis fulle ryche; Whene thay hade etene anone they armede after. Thane tha awntrende men “as armes!” askryes, With a claryoune clere, thire knyghtez to-gedyre, Callys to concelle, and of this case tellys:— “?ondyr es a companye of clene mene of armes, The keneste in contek that vndir Criste lenges; In ?one okene wode an oste are arrayede, Vndir-takande mene of thiese owte londes; As sais vs sir Priamous, so helpe seynt Peter!” “Go, mene,” quod Gawayne, “and grape in ?oure hertez, Who salle graythe to ?one greue to ?one gret lordes; ?if we gettlesse goo home, the kyng wille be greuede, And say we are gadlynges, agaste for a lyttille. We are with sir Florente, as to-daye falles, That es floure of ffraunce, for he fleede neuer; He was chosene and chargegide in chambire of the kynge, Chiftayne of this journee with cheualrye noble; Whethire he fyghte or he flee, we salle folowe aftyre; ffore alle the fere of ?one folke forsake salle I neuer!” “ffadyre,” sais sir Florent, “fulle faire ?e it telle!

Woundes noghte ?our wirchipe, my witte es bot symple; ?e are owre wardayne i-wysse, wyrke as ?owe lykes; ?e are at the ferreste noghte passande fyve hundrethe, And that es fully to fewe to feghte with theme alle, ffore harlottez and hansemene salle helpe bott littille; They wille hye theyme hyene for alle theire gret wordes!

Bot here are galyarde gomes that of the gre seruis, The kreuelleste knyghttes of the kynges chambyre, That kane carpe with the coppe knyghtly wordes; We salle proue to-daye who salle the prys wyne.” Nowe ferriours fers vn-to the fyrthe rydez, And fonngez a faire felde, and on fotte lyghttez; Prekes aftyre the pray, as pryce mene of armes. fflorent and Floridas, with fyve score knyghttez, ffolowede in the foreste, and on the way fowndys, fflyngande a faste trott, and on the folke dryffes. Than felewes fast to oure folke wele a fyve hundreth Of freke mene to the fyrthe, appone fresche horses; One sir Feraunt be-fore, apone a fayre stede, Was fosterde in Famacoste, the fende was his fadyre, He flenges to sir Florent, and pristly he kryes,— “Why flees thow, falls knyghte? the fende hafe thi saule!” Thane sir fflorent was fayne, and in fewter castys; One Fawnelle of ffryselande to fferaunt he rydys, And raghte in the reyne on the stede ryche, And rydes to-warde the rowte, restes he no lengere! ffulle butt in the frounte he flysches hyme euene, And alle dysfegoures his face with his felle wapene! Thurghe his bryghte bacenette his brayne has he towchede, And brustene his neke-bone, that alle his breste stoppede! Thane his cosyne askryede, and cryede fulle lowde, “Thowe has killede colde dede the kynge of alle knyghttes! He has bene fraistede on felde in fyftene rewmes; He fonde neuer no freke myghte feghte with hym one! Thow schalle dye for his dede with my derfe wapene, And alle the doughtty for dule that in ?one dale houes!” “ffy,” sais sir ffloridas, “thow ffleryande wryche! Thow wenes for to flay vs, ffloke-mowthede schrewe!” Bot ffloridas with a swerde, as he by glenttys, Alle the flesche of the flanke he flappes in sondyre, That alle the filthe of the freke and fele of the guttes ffoloes his fole fotte, whene he furthe rydes! Than rydes a renke to reschewe that byerne, That was Raynalde of the Rodes, and rebelle to Criste, Peruertede with paynyms that Cristene persewes; Presses in prowdly, as the praye wendes, ffore he hade in Prewsslande myche pryce wonnene; ffor-thi in presence thare he profers so large! Bot thane a renke, sir Richere of the Rounde Table, One a ryalle stede rydes hym a?aynes; Thorowe a rownnde rede schelde he ruschede hym sone, That the rosselde spere to his herte rynnes! The renke relys a-bowte and rusches to the erthe, Roris fulle ruydlye, bot rade he no more! Now alle that es fere and vnfaye of thes fyve hundreth ffalles on sir fflorent, a ffyve score knyghttes, Be-twyx a plasche and a flode, appone a flate lawnde; Oure folke fongene theire felde, and fawghte theme agaynes. Than was lowde appone lofte “Lorrayne!” askryede, Whene ledys with longe speris lasschene to-gedyrs, And “Arthure!” one oure syde, whene they meoghteaylede. Than sir fflorent and Floridas in fewtyre they caste, ffruschene one alle the ffrape, and biernes affrayede; ffellis fyve at the frounte thare they fyrste enteride, And, or they ferke forthire, fele of these othere! Brenyes browddene they briste, brittenede scheldes, Bettes and beres downe the best that theme byddes; Alle that rewlyde in the rowtte they rydene awaye, So rewdly they rere theys ryalle knyghttes! When sir Priamous, that prince, persayuede theire gamene, He hade peté in herte that he ne durste profire; He wente to sir Gawayne, and sais hym these wordes,— “Thi price mene fore thi praye putt are alle vndyre, They are with Sarazenes ouer-sette, mo thane seuene hundreth Of the Sowdanes knyghtes owt of sere londes; Walde thow suffire me, sir, for sake of thi Criste, With a soppe of thi mene suppowelle theym ones.” “I grouche noghte,” quod Gawayne, “the gree es thaire awene! They mone hafe gwerddouns fulle grett graunt of my lorde, Bot the freke mene of Fraunce fraiste theme selfene! ffrekes faughte noghte theire fille this fyftene wynter! I wille noghte stire with my stale halfe a stede lenghe, Bot they be stedde with more stuffe thane one ?one stede houys.” Thane sir Gawayne was warre, with-owttyne the wode hemmes, Wyes of the Westfale appone wyght horsez, Walopande wodely, as the waye forthes, With alle the wapyns i-wys that to the werre longez. The erle Antele the olde the avawmwarde he buskes, Ayerande one ayther hande heghte thosande knyghtez; His pelours and pauysers passede alle nombyre, That euer any prynce lede puruayede in erthe! Than the duke of Lorrayne dresesse thare-aftyre, With dowbille of the Duche-mene, that doughtty ware holdene; Paynymes of Pruyslande, prekkers fulle noble, Come prekkande be-fore with Priamous knyghttez. Than saide the erle Antele to Algere his brother,— “Me angers ernestly at Arthures knyghtez! Thus enkerly one an oste awnters theme selfene; They wille be owttrayede anone, are vndrone rynge, Thus folily one a felde to fyghte with vs alle! Bot they be fesede in faye, ferly me thynkes! Walde they purposse take, and passe one theire wayes, Prike home to theire prynce, and theire pray leue, They myghte lenghene theire lyefe, and lossene bottlittille! It wolde lyghte my herte, so helpe me oure Lorde!” “Sir,” sais sir Algere, “thay hafe littille vsede To be owttrayede withe oste: me angers the more! The fayreste schalle be fulle feye, that in oure floke ryddez, Alls fewe as they bene, are they the felde leue!” Thane gud Gawayne, gracious and noble, Alle with glorious gle he gladdis his knyghtes; “Gloppyns noghte, gud mene, for gleterand scheldes, ?ofe ?one gadlyngez be gaye one ?one gret horses! Banerettez of Bretayne, buskes vp ?our hertes! Bees noghte baiste of ?one boyes, ne of thaire bryghte wedis!

Aughte neuer siche honoure none of oure elders, Vnwyne ne Absolone, ne none of thies other! Whene we are moste in destresse, Marie we mene, That es oure maisters seyne, that he myche traistez; Melys of that mylde qwene, that menskes vs alle; Who so meles of that mayde, myskaries he neuer!” Bethese wordes ware saide, they ware noghte ferre be-hynde Bot the lenghe of a launde, and “Lorayne!” askryes. Was neuer siche a justynge at journé in erthe, In the vale of Iosephate, as gestes vs telles, Whene Iulyus and Ioatalle ware juggede to dy, As was whene the ryche mene of the Rownde Table Ruschede in-to the rowte one ryalle stedes! ffor so raythely thay rusche with roselde speris, That the raskaille was rade, and rane to the grefes, And karede to that courte as eowardes for euer! “Peter!” sais sir Gawayne, “this gladdez myne herte! That ?one gedlynges are gone, that made gret nowmbre; I hope that thees harlottez salle harme vs bot littille, ffore they wille hyde theme in haste with-in ?one holte enis! Thay are fewere one ffelde than thay were fyrste nombirde, Befourtty thousande in faythe, for alle theyre faire hostes.” Bot one Iolyan of Iene, a geante fulle howge, Has jonede one sir Ierante, a justis of Walis; Thorowe a jerownde schelde he jogges hym thorowe, And a fyne gesserawnte of gentille mayles, Ioynter and gemows, he jogges in sondyre! One a jambe stede this jurnee he makes; Thus es the geante for-juste, that errawnte Iewe, And Gerarde es jocunde, and joyes hym the more! Than the genatours of Genne enjoynes att ones, And frykis one the frowntere welle a fyve hundreth; A freke highte sir ffederike, with fulle fele other, fferkes one a frusche, and fresclyche askryes To fyghte with oure fforreours, that one felde houis. And thane the ryalle renkkes of the Rownde Table Rade furth fulle ernestly, and rydis theme agaynes, Mellis with the medille-warde, bot they ware ille machede; Of siche a grett multytude was meruayle to here. Seyne at the assemblé the Sarazenes discoueres The soueraynge of Sessoyne, that saluede was neuer; Gyawntis for-justede with gentille knyghtes, Thorowe gesserawntes of Iene jaggede to the herte! They hewe thorowe helmes hawtayne biernez, That the hiltede swerdes to thaire hertes rynnys! Than the renkes renownde of the Rownd Table Ryffes and ruyssches downe renayede wreches; And thus they dreuene to the dede dukes and erles, Alle the dreghe of the daye, with dredfulle werkes! Thane sir Priamous the prynce, in presens of lordes, Presez to his penowne, and pertly it hentes, Reuertede it redily, and a-waye rydys To the ryalle rowte of the Rownde Table; And heyly his retenuz raykes hym aftyre, ffor they his resone had rede on his schelde ryche. Owte of the scheltrone they schede, as schepe of a folde, And steris furth to the stowre, and stode be theire lorde! Seyne they sent to the duke, and saide hym thise wordes,— “We hafe bene thy sowdeours this sex ?ere and more; We for-sake the to-daye be serte of owre lorde; We sewe to oure soueraynge in sere kynges londes. Vs defawtes oure feez of this foure wyntteres; Thow arte feble and false, and noghte bot faire wordes; Oure wages are werede owte, and thi werre endide, We maye with oure wirchipe weend whethire vs lykes! I red thowe trette of a trewe, and trofle no lengere, Or thow salle tyne of thi tale ten thosande or euene.” “ffy a debles!” saide the duke, “the deuelle haue ?our bones! The dawngere of ?on doggez drede schalle I neuer! We salle dele this daye, be dedes of armes, My dede, and my ducherye, and my dere knyghtes! Siche sowdeours as ?e I sett bot att lyttille, That sodanly in defawte for-sakes theire lorde!” The duke in his schelde and dreches no lengere, Drawes hym a dromedarie, with dredfulle knyghtez; Graythes to sir Gawayne, with fulle gret nowmbyre Of gomes of Gernaide, that greuous are holdene. Thas fresche horsesede mene to the frownt rydes, ffelles of oure fforreours be fourtty at ones! They hade foughttene be-fore with a fyve hundrethe; It was no ferly, in faythe, thofe they faynt waxene. Thane sir Gawayne was grefede, and grypys his spere, And gyrdez in agayne with galyarde knyghttez; Metes the maches of Mees, and melles hym thorowe, As man of this medille-erthe, that moste hade greuede. Bot on Chastelayne, a childe of the kynges chambyre, Was warde to sir Wawayne of the weste marches, Cheses to sir Cheldrike, a cheftayne noble, With a chasyng spere he chokkes hym thurghe! This chekke hyme eschewede be chauncez of armes; So thay chase that childe, eschape may he neuer! Bot on Swyane of Swecy, with a swerde egge, The swyers swyre-bane he swappes in sondyre! He swounande diede, and on the swarthe lengede, Sweltes ewynne swiftly, and swanke he no more! Than sir Gawayne gretes with his gray eghne; The guyte was a gude mane, be-gynnande of armes. ffore the charry childe so his chere chawngide, That the chillande watire one his chekes rynnyde! “Woo es me,” quod Gawayne, “that I ne wetene hade; I salle wage for that wye alle that I welde, Bot I be wrokene on that wye, that thus has hym wondyde!” He dresses hym drerily, and to the duke rydes, Bot one sir Dolphyne the derfe dyghte hym agaynes, And sir Gawayne hym gyrd with a grym launce, That the groundene spere glade to his herte! And egerly he hente owte, and hurte a-nother, An haythene knyghte, Hardolfe, happye in armes; Sleyghly in at the slotte slyttes hyme thorowe, That the slydande spere of his hande sleppes! Thare es slayne in that slope, be elagere of his hondes, Sexty slongene in a slade of sleghe men of armes! Thofe sir Gawaynne ware wo, he wayttes hym by, And was warre of that wye that the childe wondyde, And with a swerde swiftly he swappes hym thorowe, That he swyftly swelte, and on the erthe swounes! And thane he raykes to the rowte, and ruysches one helmys; Riche hawberkes he rente, and rasede schyldes; Rydes one a rawndoune, and his rayke holdes; Thorow-owte the rerewarde he holdes wayes, And thare raughte in the reyne this ryalle the ryche, And rydez in-to the rowte of the Rownde Table. Thane oure cheualrous men changene theire horsez, Chases and choppes downe cheftaynes noble, Hittes fulle hertely on helmes and scheldes, Hurtes and hewes downe haythene knyghtez! Ketelle-hattes they cleue euene to the scholdirs! Was neuer siche a clamour of capitaynes in erthe! Thare was kynges sonnes kaughte, curtays and noble, And knyghtes of the contré, that knawene was ryche; Lordes of Lorayne and Lumbardye bothene Laugh[t]e was, and lede in with oure lele knyghttez; Thas that chasede that daye, theire chaunce was bettire, Swiche a cheke at a chace escheuede theyme neuer! When sir fflorent, be fyghte, had the felde wonene, He fferkes ine be-fore with fyve score knyghttez; Theire prayes and theire presoneres passes one aftyre, With pylours, and pauysers, and pryse mene of armes. Thane gudly sir Gawayne gydes his knyghttez, Gas in at the gayneste, as gydes hym telles, ffore greffe of a garysone of fulle gret lordes Sulde noghte gripe vpe his gere, ne swyche grame wirche. ffore-thy they stode at the straytez, and with his stale houede, Tille his prayes ware paste the pathe that he dredis; Whene they the ceté myghte see that the kyng seggede, Sothely the same daye was wit[h] asawte wonnene. An hawrawde hyes be-fore, the beste of the lordes, Hom at the herbergage, owt of tha hyghe londes; Tornys tytte to the tente, and to the kynge telles Alle the tale sothely, and how they hade spede;— “Alle thy forreours are fere, that forrayede with-owttyne, Sir fflorent, and sir ffloridas, and alle thy ferse knyghtez; Thay hafe forrayede and foghtene with fulle gret nowmbyre, And fele of thy foo-mene has broghte owt of lyffe! Oure wirchipfulle wardayne es wele escheuyde, ffor he has wonne to-daye wirchipe for euere, He has Dolfyne slayne, and the duke takyne! Many dowghty es dede be dynt of his hondes! He has presoners price, pryncez and erles, Of the richeste blode that regnys in erthe! Alle thy cheuallrous mene faire are eschewede, Bot a childe Chasteleynne myschance es be-fallene.” “Hawtayne,” sais the kyng, “harawde, be Criste! Thow has helyd myne herte, I hete the for-sothe! I ?ife the in Hamptone a hundreth pownde large.” The kynge than to assawte he sembles his knyghtez, With somercastelle and sowe appone sere halfes; Skyftis his skotiferis, and skayles the wallis, And iche wache has his warde with wiese mene of armes. Thane boldly thay buske, and bendes engynes, Payses in pylotes and proues theire castes; Mynsteris and masondewes they malle to the erthe, Chirches and chapelles chalke-whitte blawnchede. Stone [s]tepelles fulle styffe in the strete ligges, Chawmbyrs with chymnés, and many cheefe inns, Paysede and pelid downe playsterede walles; The pyne of the pople was peté for to here! Thane the duchez hire dyghte with damesels ryche, The cowntas of Crasyne with hir clere maydyns, Knelis downe in the kyrnelles thare the kyng houede, On a couerede horse comlyli arayede; They knewe hym by contenaunce, and criede fulle lowde,— “Kyng crownede of kynde, take kepe to these wordes! We be-seke ?ow, sir, as soueraynge and lorde, That ?e safe vs to-daye, for sake of ?oure Criste! Send vs some socoure, and saughte with the pople, Or the ceté be sodaynly with assawte wonnene!” He weres his vesere with a vowt noble; With vesage vertouous, this valyante bierne Meles to hir myldly with fulle meke wordes,— “Salle no mysse do ?ow, ma dame, that to me lenges; I gyf ?ow chartire of pes, and ?oure cheefe maydens, The childire and the chaste mene, the cheualrous knyghtez; The duke es in dawngere, dredis it bott littylle! He salle idene the fulle wele, dout ?ow noghte elles.” Thane sent he one iche a syde to certayne lordez, ffor to leue the assawte, the ceté was ?oldene; With the erle eldeste sone he sent hym the kayes, And seside the same nyghte, be sent of the lordes. The duke to Douere es dyghte, and alle his dere knyghtez, To duelle in dawngere and dole the dayes of hys lyue. Thare fleede, at the ferrere ?ate, folke withowttyne nombyre, ffor ferde of sir fflorent and his fers knyghtez; Voydes the ceté and to the wode rynnys, With vetaile, and vesselle, and vestoure so ryche. Thay buske vpe a banere abowne the brode ?ates. Of sir fflorent, in ffay so fayne was he neuer! The knyghte houys on a hylle, be-helde to the wallys, And saide, “I see be ?one syngne the ceté es oures!” Sir Arthure enters anone with hostes arayede, Euene at the vndrone etles to lenge. In iche leuere on lowde the kynge did crye, Of payne of lyf and lym and lesynge of londes, That no lele ligemane, that to hym lonngede, Sulde lye be no ladysse, ne be no lele maydyns, Ne be no burgesse wyffe, better ne werse; Ne no biernez myse-bide, that to the burghe longede. Whene the kyng Arthure hade lely conquerid, And the castelle couerede of the kythe riche, Alle the crowelle and kene, be craftes of armes, Captayns and constables, knewe hym for lorde. He deuysede and delte to dyuerse lordez, A dowere for the duchez and hir dere childire; Wroghte wardaynes by wytte to welde alle the londez, That he had wonnene of werre, thorowe his weise knyghtez. Thus in Lorayne he lenges as lorde in his awene, Settez lawes in the lande, as hym leefe t[h]oghte; And one the Lammese day to Lucerne he wendez, Lengez thare at laysere with lykynge i-nowe; Thare his galays ware graythede, a fulle gret nombyre, Alle gleterand as glase, vndire grene hyllys, With cabanes couerede for kynges a-noyntede, With clothes of clere golde for knyghtez and other; Sone stowede theire stuffe, and stablede theire horses, Strekes streke ouer the strem in-to the strayte londez. Now he moues his myghte with myrthes of herte, Ouere mowntes so hye, thase meruailous wayes; Gosse in by Goddarde, the garett he wynnys, Graythes the garnisone grisely wondes! Whene he was passede the heghte, than the kyng houys With his hole bataylle, be-haldande a-bowte, Lukande one Lumbarddye, and one lowde melys,— “In ?one lykande londe, lorde be I thynke.” Thane they cayre to Combe, with kyngez a-noyntede, That was kyde of the coste, kay of alle other. Sir fflorent and sir ffloridas than fowndes be-fore, With ffreke mene of ffraunce welle a fyve hundreth; To the ceté vn-sene thay soghte at the gayneste, And sett an enbuschement, als theme selfe lykys. Thane ischewis owt of that ceté, fulle sone be the morne, Slale discouerours, skyftes theire horses; Than skyftes thes skouerours, and skippes one hyllis, Diskoueres for skulkers that they no skathe lymppene; Poueralle and pastorelles passede one aftyre, With porkes to pasture at the price ?ates; Boyes in the subarbis bourdene ffulle heghe, At a bare synglere that to the bente rynnys. Thane brekes oure buscheme?t, and the brigge wynnes, Brayedez in-to the burghe with baners displayede, Stekes and stabbis thorowe that them a-?ayne-stondes; ffowre stretis, or thay stynte, they stroyene fore euere! Now es the conquerour in Combe, and his courte holdes With-in the kyde castelle, with kynges enoynttede; Reconsaillez the comouns that to the kyth lengez, Comfourthes the carefulle with knyghtly wordez; Made a captayne kene a knyghte of hys awene; Bot alle the contré and he fulle sone ware accordide. The syre of Melane herde saye the ceté was wonnene, And send to Arthure sertayne lordes, Grete sommes of golde, sexti horse chargegid, Be-soghte hyme as souerayne to socoure the pople, And saide he wolde sothely be sugette for euer, And make hyme seruece and suytte for his sere londes; ffor plesaunce of Pawnce, and of Pownte Tremble, ffor Pyse, and for Pavy, he profers fulle large, Bothe purpur, and palle, and precious stonys, Palfrayes for any prynce, and prouede stedes; And ilke a ?ere for Melane a melione of golde, Mekely at Martynmesse to menske with his hordes; And euer withowttyne askynge he and his ayers Be homagers to Arthure, whilles his lyffe lastis. The kynge be his concelle a condethe hym sendis, And he es comene to Combe, and knewe hym as lorde. In-to Tuskane he tournez, whene thus wele tymede, Takes townnes fulle tyte with towrres fulle heghe; Walles he welte downe, wondyd knyghtez, Towrres he turnes, and turmentez the pople, Wroghte wedewes fulle wlonke, wrotherayle synges, Ofte wery and wepe, and wryngene theire handis; And alle he wastys with werre, thare he awaye rydez, Thaire welthes and theire wonny[n]ges, wandrethe he wroghte! Thus they spryngene and sprede, and sparis bot lyttille, Spoylles dispetouslye, and spillis theire vynes; Spendis vn-sparely, that sparede was lange, Spedis theme to Spolett with speris inewe! ffro Spayne in-to Spruyslande the worde of hyme sprynges, And spekynngs of his spencis, disspite es fulle hugge! Towarde Viterbe this valyant avires the reynes; Avissely in that vale he vetailles his biernez, With vernage, and other wyne, and venysone bakene; And one the vicounte londes he visez to lenge. Vertely the avawmwarde voydez theire horsez, In the Vertennone vale, the vines i-mangez; Thare suggeournes this souerayne, with solace in herte, To see whene the senatours sent any wordes; Reuelle with riche wyne, riotes hym selfene, This roy with his ryalle mene of the Rownde Table, With myrthis, and melodye, and manykyne gamnes; Was neuer meriere men made one this erthe! Bot one a Seterdaye at none, a seuenyghte thare-aftyre, The konyngeste cardynalle that to the courte lengede Knelis to the conquerour, and karpes thire wordes, Prayes hym for the pes, and profyrs fulle large, To hafe peté of the pope, that put was at-vndere; Be-soghte hym of surrawns, for sake of oure Lorde, Bot a seuenyghte daye to thay ware alle semblede, And they schulde sekerlye hym see the Sonondaye ther-aftyre, In the ceté of Rome, as soueraynge and lorde; And crowne hyme kyndly with krysomede hondes, With his ceptre, as soueraynge and lorde. Of this vndyrtakynge ostage are comyne, Of ayers fulle auenaunt awughte score childrenne, In toges of tarsse fulle richelye attyryde, And be-tuke theme the kynge, and his clere knyghttes. When they had tretide thiere trewe, with trowmpynge ther-after They tryne vn-to a tente, whare tables whare raysede; The kynge hyme selfene es sette, and certayne lordes, Vndyre a sylure of sylke, sawghte at the burdez, Alle the senatours are sette sere be thame one, Serfed solemply with selcouthe metes: The kynge myghtty of myrthe, with his mylde wordes, Rehetez the Romaynes at his riche table, Comforthes the cardynalle so knyghtly hyme seluene; And this roye ryalle, as romawns vs tellis, Reuerence the Romayns in his riche table. The tawghte mene and the conynge, whene theme tyme thoghte, Tas theire lefe at the kynge, and tornede agayne; To the ceté that nyghte thaye soughte at the gayneste, And thus the ostage of Rome with Arthure es leuede. Than this roy royalle rehersys theis wordes,— “Now may we reuelle and riste, fore Rome es oure awene! Make oure ostage at ese, thise auenaunt childyrene, And luk ?e hondene theme alle that in myne oste lengez, The emperour of Almayne, and alle theis este marches; We salle be ouerlynge of alle that one the erthe lengez! We wille by the Crosse dayes encroche theis londez, And at the Crystynmesse daye be crowned ther-aftyre; Ryngne in my ryalltés, and holde my Rownde Table, Withe the rentes of Rome, as me beste lykes; Syne graythe ouer the grette see with gud mene of armes, To reuenge the renke that one the rode dyede!” Thane this comlyche kynge, as cronycles tellys, Bownnys brathely to bede with a blythe herte; Of he slynges with sleghte, and slakes gyrdille, And fore slewthe of slomowre one a slepe fallis. Bot be ane aftyre mydnyghte alle his mode changede; He mett in the morne-while fulle meruaylous dremes! And whene his dredefulle drem whas drefene to the ende, The kynge dares for dowte, dye as he scholde; Sendes aftyre phylosophers, and his affraye telles,— “Sene I was formede in fayth, so ferde whas I neuer! ffor-thy rawnsakes redyly, and rede me my swefennys, And I salle redily and ryghte rehersene the sothe. Me thoughte I was in a wode willed myne one, That I ne wiste no waye whedire that I scholde, ffore woluez, and whilde swynne, and wykkyde bestez; Walkede in that wasternne, wathes to seche; Thare lyouns fulle lothely lykkyde theire tuskes, Alle fore lapynge of blude of my lele knyghtez! Thurghe that foreste I flede, thare floures whare heghe, ffor to fele me for ferde of tha foule thyngez; Merkede to a medowe with montayngnes enclosyde, The meryeste of medillerthe that mene myghte be-holde! The close was in compas castyne alle abowte, With clauer and clereworte clede euene ouer; The vale was enuerownde with vynes of siluer, Alle with grapis of golde, gretter ware neuer, Enhorilde with arborye and alkyns trees, Erberis fulle honeste, and hyrdez there-vndyre; Alle froytez foddenid was that floreschede in erthe, ffaire frithed in frawnke appone tha free bowes; Whas thare no downkynge of dewe that oghte dere scholde, With the drowghte of the daye alle drye ware the flores! Than discendis in the dale, downe fra the clowddez, A duches dereworthily dyghte in dyaperde wedis, In a surcott of sylke fulle selkouthely hewede, Alle with loyotour ouer-laide lowe to the hemmes, And with ladily lappes the lenghe of a ?erde, And alle redily reuersside with rebanes of golde, Bruchez and besauntez, and other bryghte stonys, With hir bake and hir breste was brochede alle ouer, With kelle and with corenalle clenliche arrayede, And that so comly of colour one knowene was neuer! A-bowte cho whirllide a whele with hir whitte hondez, Ouer-whelme alle qwayntely the whele as cho scholde; The rowelle whas rede golde with ryalle stonys, Raylide with reched and rubyes i-newe; The spekes was splentide alle with speltis of siluer, The space of a spere lenghe springande fulle faire; There-one was a chayere of chalke-whytte siluer, And chekyrde with charebocle chawngynge of hewes; Appone the compas ther clewide kyngis one rawe, With corowns of clere golde that krakede in sondire: Sex was of that setille fulle sodaynliche fallene, Ilke a segge by hyme selfe, and saide theis wordez,— ‘That euer I rengnede one thir rog, me rewes it euer! Was neuer roye so riche that regnede in erthe! Whene I rode in my rowte, roughte I noghte elles, Bot reuaye, and reuelle, and rawnsone the pople! And thus I drife forthe my dayes, whilles I dreghe myghte, And there-fore derflyche I am dampnede for euer!’ The laste was a litylle mane that laide was be-nethe, His leskes laye alle lene and latheliche to schewe, The lokkes lyarde and longe the lenghe of a ?erde, His lire and his lyghame lamede fulle sore; The two eyne of the byeryne was brighttere thane siluer, The tother was ?alowere thene the ?olke of a naye. ‘I was lorde,’ quod the lede, ‘of londes i-newe, And alle ledis me lowttede that lengede in erthe; And nowe es lefte me no lappe my lygham to hele, Bot lightly now ame I loste, leue iche mane the sothe!’ The secunde sir for-sothe that sewede theme aftyre, Was sekerare to my sighte, and saddare in armes; Ofte he syghede vn-sownde, and said theis wordes,— ‘On ?one see hafe I sittene, als souerayne and lorde, And ladys me louede to lappe in theyre armes; And nowe my lordchippes are loste, and laide for euer!’ The thirde thorowely was throo, and thikke in the schuldyrs, A thra man to thrette of, there thretty ware gaderide; His dyademe was droppede downe, dubbyde with stonys, Endente alle with diamawndis, and dighte for the nonis; ‘I was dredde in my dayes,’ he said, ‘in dyuerse rewmes, And now dampnede to the dede, and dole es the more!’ The fourte was a faire mane, and forsesy in armes, The fayreste of fegure that fourmede was euer! ‘I was frekke in my faithe,’ he said, ‘whilles I one fowlde regnede, ffamows in fferre londis, and floure of alle kynges; Now es my face defadide, and foule es me hapnede, ffor I am fallene fro ferre, and frendles by-leuyde!’ The fifte was a faire mane thane fele of thies other, A fforsesy mane and a ferse, with fomand lippis; He fongede faste one the feleyghes, and fayled his armes, Bot ?it he failede and felle a fyfty fote large; Bot ?it he sprange and sprente, and spraddene his armes, And one the spere-lenghe spekes, he spekes thire wordes— ‘I was in Surrye a syr, and sett be myne one, As souerayne and seyngnour of sere kynges londis; Now of my solace I am fulle sodanly fallene, And for sake of my syne, ?one sete es me rewede!’ The sexte hade a sawtere semliche bowndene, With a surepel of silke sewede fulle faire, A harpe and a hande-slynge with harde flynte stones; What harmes he has hente he halowes fulle sone,— ‘I was demede in my dayes,’ he said, ‘of dedis of armes One of the doughtyeste that duellede in erthe; Bot I was merride one molde in my moste strenghethis, With this maydene so mylde, that mofes vs alle.’ Two kynges ware clymbande, and clauerande one heghe, The creste of the compas they couette fulle ?erne; ‘This chaire of charbokle,’ they said, ‘we chalange here-aftyre, As two of the cheffeste chosene in erthe!’ The childire ware chalke-whitte, chekys and other, Bot the chayere a-bownne cheuede they neuer: The forthirmaste was freely, with a frount large, The faireste of fyssnamy that fourmede was euer; And he was buskede in a blee of a blewe noble, With flourdelice of golde floreschede al ouer; The tother was cledde in a cote alle of clene siluer, With a comliche crosse coruene of golde, ffowre crosselettes krafty by the crosse ristes, And ther-by knewe I the kynge, that crystnede hyme semyde. Thane I went to that wlonke, and wynly hire gretis, And cho said, ‘welcome i-wis! wele arte thow fowndene; The aughte to wirchipe my wille, and thow wele cowthe, Of alle the valyant men that euer was in erthe; ffore alle thy wirchipe in werre by me has thow wonnene, I hafe bene frendely, freke, and fremmede tille other; That has thow fowndene in faithe, and fele of thi biernez, ffore I fellid downe sir Frolle with frowarde knyghtes; ffore-thi the fruytes of Fraunce are freely thynne awene. Thow salle the chayere escheue, I chese the my selfene, Be-fore alle the cheftaynes chosene in this erthe.’ Scho lifte me vp lightly with hir lene hondes, And sette me softely in the see, the septre me rechede; Craftely with a kambe cho kembede myne heuede, That the krispane kroke to my crownne raughte; Dressid one me a diademe, that dighte was fulle faire, And syne profres me a pome pighte fulle of faire stonys, Enamelde with azoure, the erth there-one depayntide, Selkylde with the salte see appone sere halfes, In sygne that I sothely was souerayne in erthe. Than broght cho me a brande with fulle bryghte hiltes, And bade me brawndysche the blade, ‘the brande es myne awene: Many swayne with the swynge has the sw[e]tte leuede; ffor whilles thow swanke with the swerde, it swykkede the neuer.’ Than raykes cho with roo, and riste whene hir likede, To the ryndes of the wode, richere was neuer; Was no pomarie so pighte of pryncez in erthe, Ne nonne apparaylle so prowde, bot paradys one. Scho bad the bewes scholde bewe downe, and bryng to my hondes Of the beste that they bare one brawnches so heghe; Than they heldede to hir heste alle holly at ones, The hegheste of iche a hirste, I hette ?ow for-sothe: Scho bade me fyrthe noghte the fruyte, bot fonde whilles me likede, ‘ffonde of the fyneste, thow freliche byerne, And reche to the ripeste, and ryotte thy seluene!

And I salle redily rolle the roo at the gayneste, And reche the the riche wyne in rynsede coupes.’ Thane cho wente to the welle by the wode enis, That alle wellyde of wyne, and wondirliche rynnes; Kaughte vp a coppe-fulle, and couerde it faire; Scho bad me dereliche drawe, and drynke to hir selfene. And thus cho lede me abowte the lenghe of an owre, With alle likynge and luffe, that any lede scholde; Bot at the myddaye fulle ewyne alle hir mode chaungede, And mad myche manace with meruayllous wordez; Whene I cryede appone hire, cho kest downe hir browes: ‘Kyng, thow karpes for noghte, be Criste that me made! ffor thow salle lose this layke, and thi lyfe aftyre, Thow has lyffede in delytte and lordchippes inewe!’ Abowte scho whirles the whele, and whirles me vndire, Tille alle my qwarters that whille whare qwaste al to peces!

The bolde kynge es in a barge and a-bowtte rowes, Alle bare-heuvede for besye with beueryne lokkes; And a beryne with his bronde, and ane helme betyne, Mengede with a mawncelet of maylis of siluer, Compaste with a coronalle, and couerde fulle riche; Kayris to yche a cogge, to comfurthe his knyghttes: To Clegys and Cleremownde he cryes one lowde,— “O Gawayne! O Galyrane! thies gud mens bodyes.” To Loth and to Lyonelle fulle louefly he melys, And to sir Lawncelot de Lake lordliche wordys,— “Lat vs couere the kythe, the coste es owre ownne; And gere theme brotheliche blenke, alle ?one blod-hondes! Bryttyne them with-in bourde, and brynne theme thare aftyre! Hewe downe hertly ?one heythene tykes! Thay are harlotes halfe, I hette ?ow myne honnde!” Than he coueres his cogge, and caches one ankere, Kaughte his comliche helme with the clere maylis; Buskes baners one brode, betyne of gowles, With corowns of clere golde clenliche arraiede; Bot thare was chosene in the chefe a chalke-whitte maydene, And a childe in hir arme, that chefe es of hevynne: With-owttene changynge in chace, thies ware the cheefe armes Of Arthure the auenaunt, qwhylles he in erthe lengede. Thane the marynerse mellys, and maysters of chippis, Merily iche a mate menys tille other; Of theire termys they talke, how thay ware tydd, Towyne trvsselle one trete, trvssene vpe sailes, Bet bonettez one brede, bettrede hatches; Brawndeste browne stele, braggede in trompes; Standis styffe one the stamyne, steris one aftyre; Strekyne ouer the streme, thare stryvynge be-gynnes. ffro the wagande wynde owte of the weste rysses, Brethly bessomes with byrre in berynes sailles; With hir bryngges one burde burliche cogges, Qwhylles the bilynge and the beme brestys in sondyre; So stowttly the forsterne one the stam hyttis, That stokkes of the stere-burde strykkys in peces! Be thane cogge appone cogge, krayers and other, Castys crepers one crosse als to the crafte langes: Thane was hede-rapys hewene that helde vpe the mastes; Thare was conteke fulle kene, and crachynge of chippys! Grett cogges of kampe crasseches in sondyre! Mony kabane clevede, cabilles destroyede! Knyghtes and kene mene killide the braynes! Kidd castelles were corvene with alle theire kene wapene, Castelles fulle comliche, that coloured ware faire! Vpcynes eghelynge thay ochene thare-aftyre, With the swynge of the swerde sweys the mastys; Ovyre-fallys in the firste frekis and othire, ffrekke in the forchipe fey es byleuefede! Than brothely they bekyre with boustouse tacle, Bruschese boldlye one burde brynyede knyghtes, Owt of botes one burde was buskede with stonys, Bett downe of the beste, brystis the hetches; Som gomys thourghe-gyrde with gaddys of yryne, Gomys gayliche clede englaymous wapene! Archers of Inglande fulle egerly schottes, Hittis thourghe the harde stele fulle hertly dynnttis! Sonne hotchene in holle the hethenne knyghtes, Hurte thourghe the harde stele, hele they neuer! Than they falle to the fyghte, ffoynes with sperys, Alle the frekkeste one frownte that to the fyghte langes; And ilkone frechely fraystez theire strenghes, Were to fyghte in the flete with theire felle wapyne. Thus they dalte that daye, thire dubbide knyghtes, Tille alle the Danes ware dede, and in the depe throwene! Than Bretones brothely with brondis they hewene, Lepys in vp one lofte lordeliche berynes; When ledys of owt-londys leppyne in waters, Alle oure lordes one lowde laughene at ones! Be thane speris whare spronngene, spalddyd chippys, Spanyolis spedily sprentyde ouer burdez; Alle the kene mene of kampe, knyghtes and other, Killyd are colde dede, and castyne ouer burdez! Theire swyers sweyftly has the swete leuyde, Hethene heuande on hatche in ther hawe ryses, Synkande in the salte see seuene hundrethe at ones! Thane sir Gawayne the gude, he has the gree wonnene, And alle the cogges grete he gafe to his knyghtes, Sir Geryne, and sir Grisswolde, and othir gret lordes; Garte Galuth, a gud gome, girde of thaire hedys! Thus of the false flete appone the flode happenede, And thus theis feryne folke fey are beleuede! ?itt es the traytoure one londe with tryede knyghttes, And alle trompede they trippe one trappede stedys, Schewes theme vndir schilde one the schire bankkes; He ne schownttes for no schame, bot schewes fulle heghe! Sir Arthure and Gawayne avyede theme bothene To sexty thosandez of mene, that in theire syghte houede. Be this the folke was fellyde, thane was the flode passede; Thane was it slyke a slowde in slakkes fulle hugge, That let the kyng for to lande, and the lawe watyre; ffor-thy he lengede one laye for lesynng of horsesys, To loke of his lege mene, and of his lele knyghtes, ?if any ware lamede or loste, life ?ife they scholde. Than sir Gawayne the gude a galaye he takys, And glides vp at a gole with gud mene of armes; Whene he growndide, for grefe he gyrdis in the watere, That to the girdylle he gos in alle his gylte wedys; Schottis vpe appone the sonde in syghte of the lordes, Sengly with hys soppe, my sorowe es the more! With baners of his bagys beste of his armes, He braydes vp-on the banke in his bryghte wedys; He byddys his baneoure, “buske thow be-lyfe To ?one brode batayle that one ?one banke houes; And I ensure ?ow sothe I salle ?owe sewe aftyre; Loke ?e blenke for no bronde, no for no bryghte wapyne, Bot beris downe of the beste and bryng theme o-dawe! Bees noghte abayste of theire boste, abyde one the erthe; ?e haue my baneres borne in batailles fulle hugge; We salle felle ?one false, the fende hafe theire saules! ffightes faste with the frape, the felde salle be owres; May I that traytoure ouer-take, torfere hyme tyddes, That this tresone has tymbyrde to my trewe lorde! Of siche a engendure fulle littylle joye happyns, And that salle in this journee be juggede fulle euene!” Now they seke ouer the sonde this soppe at the gayneste, Sembles one the sowdeours, and settys theire dyntys; Thourghe the scheldys so schene schalkes they towche, With schaftes scheueride schorte of thas schene launces; Derfe dynttys they dalte with daggande sperys; One the danke of the dewe many dede lyggys, Dukes, and duszeperis, and dubbide knyghttys; The doughttyeste of Danemarke vndone are for euer! Thus thas renkes in rewthe rittis theire brenyes, And rechis of the richeste vn-rekene dynttis; Thare they thronge in the thikke, and thristis to the erthe Of the thraeste mene thre hundrethe at ones! Bot sir Gawayne for grefe myghte noghte agayne-stande, Vmbegrippys a spere, and to a gome rynnys, That bare of gowles fulle gaye, with gowees of syluere; He gyrdes hym in at the gorge with his gryme launce, That the growndene glayfe graythes in sondyre! With that boystous brayde he bownes hym to dye! The kynge of Gutlande it was, a gude mane of armes. Thayre avawwarde than alle voydes thare-aftyre, Alls venqueste verrayely with valyant berynes; Metis with medilwarde, that Modrede ledys! Oure mene merkes theme to, as theme myshappenede— ffor hade sir Gawayne hade grace to halde the grene hille, He had wirchipe i-wys wonnnene for euer! Bot thane sir Gawayne i-wysse, he waytes hym wele To wreke hyme on this werlaughe, that this werre mouede; And merkes to sir Modrede amonge alle his beryns, With the Mownttagus, and other gret lordys. Than sir Gawayne was greuede, and with a gret wylle ffewters a faire spere, and freschely askryes,— “ffals fosterde foode, the fende haue thy bonys! ffy one the, felone, and thy false werkys! Thow salle be dede and vndone for thy derfe dedys, Or I salle dy this daye, ?if destanye worthe!” Thane his enmye, with oste of owtlawede berynes, Alle enangylles abowte oure excellente knyghttez, That the traytoure be tresone had tryede hym seluene; Dukes of Danemarke he dyghttes fulle sone, And leders of Lettowe, with legyons inewe, Vmbylappyde oure mene with launcez fulle kene, Sowdeours and Sarazenes owte of sere landys, Sexty thosande mene semlyly arrayede, Sekerly assembles thare one seuenschore knyghtes, Sodaynly in dischayte by tha salte strandes. Thane sir Gawayne grette with his gray eghene, ffor grefe of his gud mene that he gyde schulde; He wyste that thay wondyde ware, and wery for-foughttene; And what for wondire and woo, alle his witte faylede. And thane syghande he saide, with sylande terys,— “We are with Sarazenes be-sett appone sere halfes! I syghe noghte for my selfe, sa helpe oure Lorde; Bot for to [see] vs supprysede, my sorowe es the more. Bes dowghtty to-daye, ?one dukes schalle be ?oures! ffor dere Dryghttyne this daye, dredys no wapyne. We salle ende this daye alls excellent knyghttes, Ayere to endelesse joye with angelles vnwemmyde. Thofe we hafe vnwittyly wastede oure selfene, We salle wirke alle wele in the wirchipe of Cryste. We salle for ?one Sarazenes, I sekire ?ow my trowhe, Souppe with oure Saueoure solemply in heuene, In presence of that precious, prynce of alle other With prophetes, and patriarkes, and apostlys fulle nobille, Be-fore his freliche face that fourmede vs alle! ?ondire to ?one ?aldsones, he that ?eldes hyme euer, Qwhylles he es qwykke and in qwerte vnquellyde with handis, Be he neuer mo sauede, ne socourede with Cryste, Bot Satanase his sawle mowe synke in-to helle!” Than grymly sir Gawayne gryppis hys wapyne, Agayne that gret bataille he graythes hym sone; Radly of his riche swerde he reghttes the cheynys, In he schokkes his schelde, schountes he no lengare; Bot alls vnwyse, wodewyse, he wente at the gayneste, Wondis of thas wedirwyns with wrakfulle dynttys, Alle wellys fulle of blode, thare he awaye passes; And thofe hym ware fulle woo, he wondys bot lyttille, Bot wrekys at his wirchipe the wrethe of hys lorde! He stekys stedis in stoure, and sterenefulle knyghttes, That steryne mene in theire sterapes stone-dede thay lygge! He ryvys the ranke stele, he rittes the mayles; Thare myghte no renke hym areste, his resone was passede! He felle in a fransye for fersenesse of herte, He feghttis and fellis downe that hyme be-fore standis! ffelle neuer fay mane siche fortune in erthe! In-to the hale bataile hedlyngs he rynnys, And hurtes of the hardieste that one the erthe lenges! Letande alls a lyone, he lawnches theme thorowe, Lordes and ledars, that one the launde houes! ?it sir Gawayne for wo wondis bot lyttille, Bot woundis of thas wedirwynes with wondirfulle dyntes, Alls he that wold wilfully wastene hyme selfene; And for wondsome and wille alle his wit failede, That wode alls a wylde beste he wente at the gayneste; Alle walewede one blode, thare he a-waye passede; Iche a wy may be warre, be wreke of an-other! Than he moues to sir Modrede amange alle his knyghttes, And mett hyme in the myde schelde, and mallis hyme thorowe; Bot the schalke for the scharpe he schownttes a littille, He schare hyme one the schorte rybbys a schaftmonde large! The schafte schoderede and schotte in the schire beryne, That the schadande blode ouer his schanke rynnys, And schewede one his schynbawde, that was schire burneste! And so they schyfte and schove, he schotte to the erthe; With the lussche of the launce he lyghte one hys schuldyrs, Ane akere lenghe one a launde, fulle lothely wondide. Than Gawayne gyrde to the gome, and one the groffe fallis; Alls his grefe was graythede, his grace was no bettyre! He schokkes owtte a schorte knyfe schethede with siluere, And scholde haue slottede hyme in, bot no slytte happenede; His hand sleppid and slode o slante one the mayles, And the tother slely slynges hym vndire: With a trenchande knyfe the traytoure hym hyttes, Thorowe the helme and the hede, one heyghe one the brayne: And thus sir Gawayne es gone, the gude man of armes, With-owttyne reschewe of renke, and rewghe es the more! Thus sir Gawaynne es gone, that gyede many othire; ffro Gowere to Gernesay, alle the gret lordys Of Glamour, of Galys londe, this galyarde knyghtes, ffor glent of gloppynyng glade be they neuer! Kyng ffroderike of Fres faythely thare-aftyre, ffraynes at the false mane of owre ferse knyghte; “Knew thow euer this knyghte in thi kithe ryche, Of whate kynde he was comene? be-knowe now the sothe; Qwat gome was he this with the gaye armes, With this gryffoune of golde, that es one growffe fallyne? He has grettly greffede vs, sa me Gode helpe! Gyrde downe oure gude mene, and greuede vs sore! He was the sterynneste in stoure that euer stele werryde, ffore he has stonayede oure stale, and stroyede for euer!” Than sir Mordrede with mouthe melis fulle faire; “He was makles one molde, mane, be my trowhe; This was sir Gawayne the gude, the gladdeste of othire, And the graciouseste gome that vndire God lyffede, Mane hardyeste of hande, happyeste in armes, And the hendeste in hawle vndire heuene riche; The lordelieste of ledynge qwhylles he lyffe myghte, ffore he was lyone allossede in londes i-newe; Had thow knawene hym, sir kynge, in kythe thare he lengede, His konynge, his knyghthode, his kyndly werkes, His doyng, his doughtynesse, his dedis of armes, Thow wolde hafe dole for his dede the dayes of thy lyfe!” ?it that traytour alls tite teris lete he falle, Turnes hym furthe tite, and talkes no more, Went wepand a-waye, and weries the stowndys, That euer his werdes ware wroghte siche wandrethe to wyrke: Whene he thoghte on this thynge, it thirllede his herte; ffor sake of his sybb blode sygheande he rydys; When that renayede renke remembirde hym seluene, Of reuerence and ryotes of the Rownde Table, He remyd and repent hyme of alle his rewthe werkes, Rode awaye with his rowte, ristys he no lengere, ffor rade of oure riche kynge, ryve that he scholde. Thane kayres he to Cornewaile, carefulle in herte, Be-cause of his kynsemane that one the coste ligges: He taries tremlande ay, tydandis to herkene. Than the traytoure treuntede the Tyseday thar-aftyre, Trynnys in with a trayne tresone to wirke, And by the Tambire that tide his tentis he reris, And thane in a mette-while a messangere he sendes, And wraite vn-to Waynor how the werlde chaungede, And what comliche coste the kyng was aryuede, One floode foughtene with his fleete, and fellyd theme o lyfe; Bade hir ferkene oo ferre, and fflee with hir childire, Whills he myghte wile hyme awaye, and wyne to hir speche, Ayere in-to Irelande, in-to thas owte-mowntes, And wonne thare in wildernesse with-in tha wast landys. Than cho ?ermys and ?ee at ?orke in hir chambire, Gronys fulle grysely with gretand teres, Passes owte of the palesse with alle hir pryce maydenys, Towarde Chestyre in a charre thay chese hir the wayes, Dighte hir ewyne for to dye with dule at hir herte; Scho kayres to Karelyone, and kawghte hir a vaile, Askes thare the habite in the honoure of Criste, And alle for falsede, and frawde, and fere of hir louerde! Bot whene oure wiese kynge wiste that Gawayne was landede, He al to-wrythes for woo, and wryngande his handes, Gers lawnche his botes appone a lawe watire, Londis als a lyone with lordliche knyghtes, Slippes in in the sloppes o-slante to the girdylle, Swalters vpe swyftly with his swerde drawene, Bownnys his bataile and baners displayes, Buskes ouer the brode sandes with breth at his herte, fferkes frekkly one felde thare the feye lygges; Of the traytours mene one trappede stedis, Ten thosandez ware tynte, the trewghe to acownt, And certane on owre syde seuene score knyghtes In soyte with theire souerayne vn-sownde are beleuede! The kynge comly ouer-keste knyghtes and othire, Erlles of Awfrike, and Estriche berynes Of Orgaile and Orekenay, the Iresche kynges, The nobileste of Norwaye, nowmbirs fulle hugge, Dukes of Danamarke, and dubbid knyghtes; And the guchede kynge in the gay armes Lys gronande one the grownnde, and girde thorowe evene! The riche kynge ransakes with rewthe at his herte, And vp rypes the renkes of alle the Rownde Tabylle; Ses theme alle in a soppe in sowte by theme one, With the Sarazenes vn-sownde enserchede a-bowte; And sir Gawayne the gude in his gaye armes, Vmbegrippede the girse, and one grouffe fallene, His baners braydene downe, betyne of gowlles, His brand and his brade schelde al blody be-rouene; Was neuer oure semliche kynge so sorowfulle in herte, Ne that sanke hyme so sade, bot that sighte one. Than gliftis the gud kynge, and glopyns in herte, Gronys fulle grisely with gretande teris; Knelis downe to the cors, and kaught it in armes, Kastys vpe his vmbrere, and kyssis hyme sone, Lokes one his eye-liddis, that lowkkide ware faire, His lippis like to the lede, and his lire falowede! Than the corownde kyng cryes fulle lowde,— “Dere kosyne o kynde, in kare am I leuede! ffor nowe my wirchipe es wente, and my were endide! Here es the hope of my hele, my happynge of armes! My herte and my hardynes hale one hym lengede! My concelle, my comforthe, that kepide myne herte! Of alle knyghtes the kynge that vndir Criste lifede, Thou was worthy to be kynge, thofe I the corowne bare! My wele and my wirchipe of alle this werlde riche Was wonnene thourghe sir Gawayne, and thourghe his witt one! Allas!” saide sir Arthure, “nowe ekys my sorowe! I am vttirly vndone in myne awene landes! A dowttouse derfe dede, thou duellis to longe! Why drawes thou so one dreghe? thow drownnes myne herte!” Than swe[l]tes the swete kynge and in swoune fallis, Swafres vp swiftely, and swetly hym kysses, Tille his burliche berde was blody be-rowne, Alls he had bestes birtenede, and broghte owt of life; Ne had sir Ewayne comene, and othire grete lordys, His bolde herte had broustene for bale at that stownde! “Blyne,” sais thies bolde mene, “thow blondirs thi selfene, This es botles bale, for bettir bees it neuer! It es no wirchipe i-wysse to wryng thyne hondes. To wepe als a womane it es no witt holdene! Be knyghtly of contenaunce, als a kyng scholde, And leue siche clamoure for Cristes lufe of heuene!” “ffor blode,” said the bolde kynge, “blyne salle I neuer, Or my brayne to-briste, or my breste other! Was neuer sorowe so softe that sanke to my herte, Itt es fulle sibb to my selfe, my sorowe es the more! Was neuer so sorowfulle a syghte seyne with myne eyghene! He es sakles supprysede for syne of myne one!” Downe knelis the kynge, and kryes fulle lowde; With carefulle contenaunce he karpes thes wordes,— “O rightwis riche Gode, this rewthe thow be-holde! This ryalle rede blode ryne appone erthe; It ware worthy to be schrede and schrynede in golde, ffor it es sakles of syne, sa helpe me oure Lorde!” Downe knelis the kyng with kare at his herte, Kaughte it vpe kyndly with his clene handis, Keste it in a ketille-hatte, and couerde it faire, And kayres furthe with the cors in kyghte thare he lenges. “Here I make myn avowe,” quod the kynge thane, “To Messie, and to Marie, the mylde qwenne of heuene, I salle neuer ryvaye, ne racches vn-cowpylle At roo ne rayne-dere, that rynnes apponne erthe; Neuer grewhownde late glyde, ne gossehawke latt flye, Ne neuer fowle see fellide, that flieghes with wenge; ffawkone ne formaylle appone fiste handille, Ne ?itt with gerefawcone rejoyse me in erthe; Ne regnne in my royaltez, ne halde my Rownde Table, Tille thi dede, my dere, be dewly reuengede! Bot euer droupe and dare, qwylles my lyfe lastez, Tille Drightene and derfe dede hafe done qwate theme likes!” Than kaughte they vpe the cors with kare at theire hertes, Karyed [it] one a coursere with the kynge selfene; The waye vn-to Wynchestre thay wente at the gayneste, Wery and wandsomdly, with wondide knyghtes; Thare come the prior of the plas, and professide monnkes, Apas in processione, and with the prynce metys; And he be-tuke thame the cors of the knyghte noble. “Lokis it be clenly kepyd,” he said, “and in the kirke holdene, Done for derygese, as to the ded fallys, Menskede with messes, for mede of the saule: Loke it wante no waxe, ne no wirchipe elles, And at the body be bawmede, and one erthe holdene, ?iff thou kepe thi couent encroche any wirchipe At my comyng a-gayne, ?if Crist wille it thole; A-byde of the beryenge tille they be broughte vndire, That has wroghte vs this woo, and this werre mouede.” Than sais sir Wychere the wy, a wyese mane of armes, “I rede ?e warely wende, and wirkes the beste; Soiorne in this ceté, and semble thi berynes, And bidde with thi bolde mene in thi burghe riche: Get owt knyghttez of contres, that castelles holdes, And owt of garysons grete gude mene of armes, ffor we are faithely to fewe to feghte with theme alle, That we see in his sorte appone the see bankes.” With krewelle contenance thane the kyng karpis theis wordes,— “I praye the kare noghte, sir knyghte, ne caste thou no dredis! Hadde I no segge bot my selfe one vndir sone, And I may hym see with sighte, or one hym sette hondis, I salle evene amange his mene malle hym to dede, Are I of the stede styre halfe a stede lenghe! I salle [stryke] hym in his stowre, and stroye hyme for euer, And thare-to make I myne avowe devottly to Cryste, And to hys modyre Marie, the mylde qwene of heuene! I salle neuer soiourne sounde, ne sawghte at myne herte, In ceté ne in subarbe sette appone erthe, Ne ?itt slomyre ne slepe with my slawe eyghne, Tille he be slayne that hym slowghe, ?if any sleyghte happene: Bot euer pursue the payganys that my pople distroyede, Qwylls I may pare theme and pynne, in place thare me likes.” Thare durste no renke hym areste of alle the Rownde Table, Ne none paye that prynce with plesande wordes, Ne none of his lige mene luke hym in the eyghne, So lordely he lukes for losse of his knyghttes! Thane drawes he to Dorsett, and dreches no langere, Derefulle dredlesse with drowppande teris; Kayeris in-to Kornewayle with kare at his herte, The trays of the traytoure he trynys fulle euenne; And turnys in be the Treyntis the traytoure to seche, ffyndis hym in a foreste the Frydaye there-aftire; The kyng lyghttes one fott, and freschely askryes, And with his freliche folke he has the felde nommene! Now isschewis his enmye vndire the wode eynys, With ostes of alynes fulle horrebille to schewe! Sir Mordrede the Malebranche, with his myche pople, ffoundes owt of the foreste appone fele halfes, In seuene grett batailles semliche arrayede, Sexty thowsande mene, the syghte was fulle hugge, Alle fyghtande folke of the ferre lanndes, ffaire fettede one frownte be tha fresche strondes! And alle Arthurs oste was amede with knyghtes Bot awghtene hundrethe of alle, entrede in rolles; This was a mache vn-mete, bot myghttis of Criste, To melle with that multitude in thase man londis. Than the royalle roy of the Rownde Table Rydes one a riche stede, arrayes his beryns, Buskes his avawmwarde, als hym beste likes; Sir Ewayne, and sir Errake, and othire gret lordes, Demenys the medilwarde menskefully thare-aftyre, With Merrake and Meneduke, myghtty of strenghes; Idirous and Alymere, thire auenaunt childrene, Ayers with Arthure, with seuene score of knyghtes; He rewlis the rerewarde redyly thare-aftyre, The rekeneste redy mene of the Rownde Table, And thus he fittis his folke, and freschely askryes, And syene comforthes his mene with knyghtlyche wordes— “I be-seke ?ow, sirs, for sake of oure Lorde, That ?e doo wele to-daye, and dredis no wapene! ffighttes fersely nowe, and fendis ?oure seluene, ffellis downe ?one feye folke, the felde salle be owrs!

Loke ?e lett for no lede lordly to wirche; Layes ?one laddes lowe be the layke ende! Take no tente vn-to me, ne tale of me rekke, Bes besy one my baners with ?oure brighte wapyns, That they be strenghely stuffede with steryne knyghtes, And holdene lordly one lofte ledys to schewe; ?if any renke theme arase, reschowe theme sone. Wirkes now my wirchipe, to-daye my werre endys! ?e wotte my wele and my woo, wirkkys as ?ow likys! Crist comly with crowne comforthe ?ow alle, ffor the kyndeste creatours that euer kynge ledde! I gyffe ?ow alle my blyssyng with a blithe wille, And alle Bretowns bolde, blythe mote ?e worthe!” They pype vpe at pryme tyme, approches theme nere, Pris mene and priste proues theire strenghes Bremly the brethemen bragges in troumppes, In cornettes comlyly, whene knyghttes assembles, And thane jolyly enjoynys theis jentylle knyghttes; A jolyere journé ajuggede was neuer, Whene Bretones boldly enbraces theire scheldes, And Cristyne encroyssede theme, and castis in fewtire! Than sir Arthure oste his enmye askryes, And in they schokke theire scheldes, schontes no lengare; Schotte to the schiltrones, and schowttes fulle heghe, Thorowe scheldis fulle schene schalkes they touche! Redily thas rydde mene of the Rownde Table With ryalle rannke stele rittys theire mayles; Bryneys browddene they briste, and burneste helmys, Hewes haythene mene downe, halses in sondre! ffyghtande with fyne stele, the feye blod rynnys, Of the frekkeste of frounte, vn-fers ere be-levede. Ethyns of Argayle and Irische kynges Enverounes oure avawmwarde with venymmos berynes; Peghttes and paynymes with perilous wapyns, With speres disspetousely disspoylles oure knyghttes, And hewede downe the hendeste with hertly dynttys! Thorow the holle batayle they holdene theire wayes; Thus fersly they fyghte appone sere halfes, That of the bolde Bretones myche blode spillis Thare durste non rescowe theme, for reches in erthe, The steryne ware thare so stedde, and stuffede wit[h] othire: He durste noghte stire a steppe, bot stodde for hyme seluene, Tille thre stalis ware stroyede be strenghe of hyme one! “Idrous,” quod Arthure, “ayre the by-houes! I see sir Ewayne ouer-sette with Sarazenes kene! Redy the for rescows, arraye thee sone! Hye the with hardy mene in helpe of thy ffadire! Sett in one the syde, and socoure ?one lordes; Bot they be socourrede and sownde, vnsawghte be I neuer!” Idrous hyme ansuers ernestly thare-aftyre,— “He es my fadire in faithe, for-sake salle I neuer, He has me fosterde and fedde, and my faire bretherene, Bot I for-sake this gate, so me Gode helpe, And sothely alle sybredyne bot thy selfe one; I breke neuer his biddynge for beryne one lyfe, Bot euer bouxvme as beste blethely to wyrke! He commande me kyndly, with knyghtly wordes, That I schulde lelely one the lenge, and one noo lede elles; I salle hys commandement holde, ?if Criste wil me thole! He es eldare thane I, and ende salle we bothene; He salle ferkke be-fore, and I salle come aftyre: ?iffe hyme be destaynede to dy to-daye one this erthe, Criste comly with crowne take kepe to hys saule!” Than remys the riche kynge with rewthe at his herte, Hewys hys handys one heghte, and to the heuene lokes,— “Qwythene hade Dryghttyne destaynede at his dere wille, That he hade demyd me to-daye to dy for ?ow alle! That had I leuer than be lorde alle my lyfe tyme, Off alle that Alexandere aughte qwhilles he in erthe lengede.” Sir Ewayne and sir Errake, thes excellente beryns, Enters in one the oste, and egerly strykes; The ethenys of Orkkenaye and Irische kynges, Thay gobone of the gretteste with growndene swerdes, Hewes one thas hulkes with theire harde wapyns, Layed downe thas ledes with lothely dynttys; Schuldirs and scheldys thay schrede to the hawnches, And medilles thourghe mayles thay merkene in sondire! Siche honoure neuer aughte none erthely kyng At theire endyng daye, bot Arthure hyme seluene! So the droughte of the daye dryede theire hertes, That bothe drynkles they dye, dole was the more! Now mellys oure medille-warde, and mengene to-gedire. Sir Mordrede the Malebranche with his myche pople, He had hide hyme be-hynde with-in thas holte eynys, With halle bataile one hethe, harme es the more! He hade sene the conteke al clene to the ende, How oure cheualrye cheuyde be chaunces of armes! He wiste oure folke was for-foughttene, that thare was feye leuede; To encowntere the kynge he castes hyme sone, Bot the churles chekyne hade chaungyde his armes; He had sothely for-sakene the sawturoure engrelede, And laughte vpe thre lyons alle of whitte siluyre, Passande in purpre of perrie fulle riche, ffor the kynge sulde noghte knawe the cawtelous wriche! Be-cause of his cowardys he keste of his atyre; Bot the comliche kyng knewe hym fulle swythe, Karpis to sir Cadors thes kyndly wordez,— “I see the traytoure come ?ondyr trynande fulle ?erne; ?one ladde with the lyones es like to hyme selfene! Hym salle torfere be-tyde, may I touche ones, ffor alle his tresone and trayne, alls I am trew lorde! To-day Clarente and Caliburne salle kythe theme to-gedirs, Whilke es kenere of kerfe, or hardare of eghge! ffraiste salle we fyne stele appone fyne wedis. Itt was my derlynge daynteuous, and fulle dere holdene, Kepede fore encorownmentes of kynges enoynttede, One dayes when I dubbyde dukkes and erlles; It was burliche borne be the bryghte hiltes; I durste neuer dere it in dedis of armes, Bot euer kepide clene, be-cause of my seluene. ffor I see Clarent vn-clede, that crowne es of swerdes, My wardrop of Walyngfordhe I wate es distroyede; Wist no wy of wone bot Waynor hir seluene, Scho hade the kepynge hir selfe of that kydde wapyne, Off cofres enclosede that to the crowne lengede, With rynges and relikkes, and the regale of ffraunce, That was ffowndene one sir ffrolle, whene he was feye leuyde.” Than sir Marrike in malyncoly metys hym sone, With a mellyd mace myghtyly hym strykes; The bordoure of his bacenett he bristes in sondire, That the schire rede blode ouer his brene rynnys! The beryne blenkes for bale, and alle his ble chaunges, Bot ?itt he byddys as a bore, and brymly he strykes! He braydes owte a brande bryghte als euer ony syluer, That was sir Arthure awene, and Vtere his fadirs, In the wardrop of Walyngfordhe was wonte to be kepede; Thare-with the derfe dogge syche dynttes he rechede, The tother with-drewe one dreghe and durste do none other; ffor sir Marrake was mane merrede in elde, And sir Mordrede was myghty, and [in] his moste strenghis; Come none with-in the compas, knyghte ne none other, With-in the swyng of swerde, that ne he the swete leuyd. That persayfes oure prynce, and presses to faste, Strykes in-to the stowre by strenghe of hys handis; Metis with sir Mordrede, he melis vn-faire,— “Turne, traytoure vntrewe, the tydys no bettyre; Be gret Gode, thow salle dy with dynt of my handys! The schalle rescowe no renke ne reches in erthe!” The kyng with Calaburne knyghtly hym strykes, The cantelle of the clere schelde he kerfes in sondyre, In-to the schuldyre of the schalke a schaftmonde large, That the schire rede blode schwede one the maylys! He schodirde and schrenkys, and schontes bott lyttille, Bott schokkes in scharpely in his schene wedys; The ffelonne with the ffyne swerde freschely he strykes, The ffelettes of the fferrere syde he flassches in sondyre, Thorowe jopowne and jesserawnte of gentille mailes! The freke fichede in the flesche an halfe fotte large; That derfe dynt was his dede, and dole was the more That euer that doughtty sulde dy, bot at Dryghttyns wylle! ?itt with Calyburne his swerde, fulle knyghttly he strykes, Kastes ine his clere schelde, and coueres hym fulle faire; Swappes of the swerde hande, als he by glentes, Ane inche fro the elbowe, he ochede it in sondyre, That he swounnes one the swarthe, and one swym fallis; Thorowe bracer of browne stele, and the bryghte mayles, That the hilte and the hande appone the hethe ligges! Thane frescheliche the freke the ffente vpe rererys, Brochis hym in with the bronde to the bryghte hiltys, And he brawles one the bronde, and bownes to dye. “In faye,” says the feye kynge, “sore me for-thynkkes That euer siche a false theefe so faire an ende haues.” Qwene they had ffenyste this feghte, thane was the felde wonnene, And the false folke in the felde feye are by-leuede! Tille a fforeste they fledde, and felle in the greuys, And fers feghtande folke folowes theme aftyre; Howntes and hewes downe the heythene tykes, Mourtherys in the mowntaygnes sir Mordrede knyghtes; Thare chapyde neuer no childe, cheftayne ne other, Bot choppes theme downe in the chace, it chargys bot littylle! Bot whene sir Arthure anone sir Ewayne he fyndys, And Errake the auenaunt, and other grett lordes, He kawghte vp sir Cador with care at his herte, Sir Clegis, sir Cleremonde, thes clere mene of armes, Sir Lothe, and sir Lyonelle, sir Lawncelott, and Lowes, Marrake and Meneduke, that myghty ware euer; With langoure in the launde thare he layes theme togedire, Lokede one theyre lighames, and with a lowde steuene, Alls lede that liste noghte lyfe and loste had his myrthis; Than he stotays for made, and alle his strenghe faylez, Lokes vpe to the lyfte, and alle his lyre chaunges, Downne he sweys fulle swythe, and in a swoune fallys, Vpe he coueris one kneys, and kryes fulle oftene,— “Kyng comly with crowne, in care am I leuyde! Alle my lordchipe lawe in lande es layde vndyre! That me has gyfene gwerdones, be grace of hym seluene, Mayntenyde my manhede be myghte of theire handes, Made me manly one molde, and mayster in erthe; In a tenefulle tyme this torfere was rereryde, That for a traytoure has tynte alle my trewe lordys! Here rystys the riche blude of the Rownde Table, Rebukkede with a rebawde, and rewthe es the more! I may helples one hethe house be myne one, Alls a wafulle wedowe that wanttes hir beryne! I may werye and wepe, and wrynge myne handys, ffor my wytt and my wyrchipe awaye es for euer! Off alle lordchips I take leue to myne ende! Here es the Bretones blode broughte owt of lyfe, And nowe in this journee alle my joy endys!” Thane relyes the renkes of alle the Rownde Table, To the ryalle roy thay ride tham alle; Than assembles fulle sonne seuene score knyghtes, In sighte to thaire souerayne, that was vnsownde leuede; Than knelis the crownede kynge, and kryes one lowde,— “I thanke the, Gode, of thy grace, with a gud wylle; That gafe vs vertue and witt to vencows this beryns; And vs has grauntede the gree of theis gret lordes! He sent vs neuer no schame, ne schenchipe in erthe, Bot euer ?it the ouer-hande of alle other kynges: We hafe no laysere now these lordys to seke, ffor ?one laythely ladde me lamede so sore! Graythe vs to Glaschenbery, vs gaynes none other; Thare we may ryste vs with roo, and raunsake oure wondys. Of this dere day werke, the Dryghttene be louede, That vs has destaynede and demyd to dye in oure awene.” Thane they holde at his heste hally at ones, And graythes to Glasschenberye the gate at the gayneste; Entres the Ile of Aueloyne, and Arthure he lyghttes, Merkes to a manere there, for myghte he no forthire: A surgyne of Salerne enserches his wondes, The kyng sees be asaye that sownde bese he neuer, And sone to his sekire mene he said theis wordes,— “Doo calle me a confessour, with Criste in his armes; I wille be howselde in haste, whate happe so be-tyddys; Constantyne my cosyne he salle the corowne bere, Alls be-commys hym of kynde, ?ife Criste wille hym thole! Beryne, fore my benysone, thowe berye ?one lordys, That in baytaille with brondez are broghte owte of lyfe; And sythene merke manly to Mordrede childrene, That they bee sleyghely slayne, and slongene in watyrs; Latt no wykkyde wede waxe, ne wrythe one this erthe; I warne fore thy wirchipe, wirke alls I bydde! I fore-gyffe alle greffe, for Cristez lufe of heuene! ?ife Waynor hafe wele wroghte, wele hir be-tydde!” He saide In manus with mayne one molde whare he ligges, And thus passes his speryt, and spekes he no more! The baronage of Bretayne thane, bechopes and othire, Graythes theme to Glaschenbery with gloppynnande hertes, To bery thare the bolde kynge, and brynge to the erthe, With alle wirchipe and welthe that any wy scholde. Throly belles thay rynge, and Requiem syngys, Dosse messes and matyns with mournande notes: Relygeous reueste in theire riche copes, Pontyficalles and prelates in precyouse wedys, Dukes and dusszeperis in theire dule-cotes, Cowntasses knelande and claspande theire handes, Ladys languessande and lowrande to schewe; Alle was buskede in blake, birdes and othire, That schewede at the sepulture, with sylande teris; Whas neuer so sorowfulle a syghte seene in theire tyme! Thus endis kyng Arthure, as auctors alegges, That was of Ectores blude, the kynge sone of Troye, And of sir Pryamous, the prynce, praysede in erthe; ffro thethene broghte the Bretons alle his bolde eldyrs In-to Bretayne the brode, as the Bruytte tellys. et c'. explicit.
