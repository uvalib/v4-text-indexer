      <field name="fulltext">PART I FROM THE VOLUME OF 1882 A cold-blooded, laggard, worrying hunt after rhymes which can be made serviceable. . . .â O. W. Holmes: âOver the Teacups.â WHITE LIES Could I be young as I once was youngâ Young, body and heart, again: Could you but be fair as you once were fair (But wishing, ah me! is vain); There were happiness now that we missed somehow In days that ended in pain. Could I but love as once I loved In old old days that are sped: Could you but be true as I thought you true Ere trust in my heart was dead; There were still to know, in place of woe, Ah me, what a joy instead! But I may not love as I loved in youth, Nor trust as I trusted then; Nor beauty is yours, nor the little of truth That you brought to the sons of men: There is nothing to mend, and here must end My songâbut I loved you then! READER TO NOVELIST I hold it not the wisest plan To make your hero out a man For ever in the right, And so alarmingly endowed With virtue that an average cloud (Or, if you better like it, spout) Of envy, defamation, spite Can scarce obscure, and can't put out, His flickering candle-light. Your novel-writer, not content With average stature, 5 feet 9, And morals such as have to serve Mere men of God's design, Seeks grand, chryselephantine, men Whose strength is as the strength of ten, Of beauty half divine. Dear novelist, unto me list; I'd sooner death than with a breath Of mine Malign This paragon of excellence This âmoral porcupine.â But think how short is actual life, Docked by old Time's pruning-knife, How long your last romance is! And think how brief would be your course Had you the brilliant chances You give your hero every day To fall before resistless force, Or slighted love, or dull remorse, Or suicidal fancies. The modern novel, I submit, There's very much too much of it. And all, I think, because You give your hero such physique, He's tougher than the toughest Greek, (You couldn't kill him in a week!) He scoffs at Nature's laws. And then again, so fair a vein His whole existence hallows, It were insane to rack one's brain In hope to lure this creature pure Beyond his moral shallows, Or catch him in one little sin, Precursor of the gallows. For human nature's daily food He's much too strong and much too good. THE ANSWER Suppose, dear Reader, I should choose, By old tradition undeterred, Some hero from the common herd And ask the public to peruse The story of a life that moved For ever in a midway track, With little record at the back Of Vice detected, Virtue proved (As may be thine), were it a thing To marvel at if in an hour, Lulled by its soporific power, I found thee, reader, slumbering? CAMBRIDGE ROWING, 1874-8 It's vastly engaging When a snowstorm is raging, And a hurricane shrieks Thro' shadowy breeks, To loaf by the river And grumble and shiver Until the boat-captain, His âulsterâ well wrapt in, Appears on the scene. And when we are ready, The âshipâ isn't steady, The water is âheady,â The âworkâ is oppressive, The captain aggressive, And swearing like mad By everything badâ Eternally slanging The writer for âhanging,â For âsugaring,â âcocking,â Or âknifing,â or ârockingââ And when a boat-captain, His dignity wrapt in, Develops his views Bad language ensues. I'll endeavour to paint, In portraiture faint, The pleasures of rowing; Commencing by showing The style of oration The youth of this nation Requires to inflame His yearning for Fame, And will offer it thee In paraphrase free, Replacing by dashes Such language as clashes With prevalent notion Of verbal emotion. (CAPTAIN'S ADDRESS FROM THE TOWING-PATH.) Get her ready! Forward! Row! Keep her steady! Let her go! Now she's strolling! Sit Ã¹p! Bow! You are rÃ²lling Like a cow! Now then, DâN it! Blazes, Two! Tr? to lamn it On, man, do! Feel your strÃ¨tchers! Curse you, Three! (Can't you, splash it Over me?) Swing togÃ¨ther Every oar! Off the feÃ ther Sooner, Four! Keep your bÃ cks up! Look alÃ¬ve! Where d'you hope to Go to, Five? (Go to Heaven? Go to Hâll!) Six, you're cocking! Seven, you're lÃ te! Shocking, shocking, Ghastly Eight! Referring, of course, to the whole crew, and not to the âstrokeâ of the boat. Keep it gÃ²ing! NÃ¨ver saw D-mnder rowing! E-A-S-Y all. Why should I continue? 'Tis surely not in you To list any longer To language no stronger Than dash it, or dân it, And yet if I cram it With oaths better suited To please the polluted I fear some ill fame May attach to my name; For I often aspire In poetry higher, And care not to venture Incurring the censure Of scandalised readers In eloquent âleaders,â For I shrewdly suspect They would rise and reject And spurn and resent all, With anger prodigious, My songs sentimental, My epics religious. AN EXHORTATION âThe spectacle of an entire nation grovelling in contentment is an exasperating thing.ââMark Twain. So many battles still unfought, So many eager to be taught, So many preachers prone to preach, That mere plenitude of thought Strikes poverty on speech? Or tell me, fellow Interchangers, These lines were first circulated in manuscript in a magazine called The Interchange. Must we henceforth meet as strangers? See with mutual resentment Nothing mutual in our views? Do you âgrovel in contentmentâ? Is there nothing to make better? Is there nothing to abuse? Is not the army âstandingâ? Is not monarchy a sham? Is not Beaconsfield in office? Do not tin tacks in the jam Arouse your indignation? Nor the nauseating dram- Drinking habits of the country (Making bumpkins into brutes)? Nor the age of Mrs. Grundy? Nor the price of shoddy suits? Does not a cry of âWoman's Rightsâ Arouse a righteous ire To rectify her wicked wrongs, And wickeder attire? While sermons may be preached that sticks Have hammered out of stones, Are âcruelty to animals,â And pictures by Burne Jones, And âuniversal suffrageâ (Including man and beast), Iniquities in needlework, And âhorrors in the Eastâ Themes that can move no flexile quill To quiver in the least? While vice is rampant through the land, And china lovers swear That real old âChelseaâ can't be had, Nor true blue crockery ware, That âDresden'sâ unreliable, And âWedgwoodâ even rare, Should any hand be idle That might propel a quill? Should any pulse be placid? Should any tongue be still? Till decency and order reign Where drunkenness has been, Till curious old mezzotints On Morris-papered walls are seen (Replacing noxious German prints And poisoned arsenic green), Till that far-distant, longed-for day When savages shall think That Christian creed, and Christian oaths, And Christian stores of left-off clothes, And Christian measles, Christian drink, Are better than their heathen oaths, Their meagre scantity of clothes, Their unfermented drink. Until, in short, some longed-for day When, happy in success, We've taught all men to clothe themselves, And taught ourselves to dress. Till all the nations feel as we On English soil to-day That 'tis âsinfulâ to be worsted In a âgreat and wickedâ fray: But to spend a little money, And waste a lot of life, Is a âNoble undertakingâ In a small unrighteous strife. Till Mr. Gaze, and Mr. Cook, Have cleared the space betwixt us, And every hungry soul may look On the Madonna of âSan Sixtusâ Until on all her eyes have dwelt So loving, sweet, so sad-serene, And each, assisted by their light, His heart just once has seen And feltâfar better than before Yet very very mean.â Till Love is re-established In Mrs. Grundy's rules, Till bloodshed is abolished And âyoung ladiesâ boarding-schools,â Till all who pine in woful want May roll in wilful waste, Till every one is very good And everything in âtaste.ââ Should any hand be idle That might propel a quill? Should any pulse be placid? Should any tongue be still? NOW AND THEN Once there was no heaven Other than I knew In the limitless world beyond The fathomless blue Of eyes that were wistful and wondrous And loving and true. Was the flame too fierce to be lasting? The setting too rich for the jewel? Was it pleasant forecasting the glances Of eyes too kind to be cruel? Was the setting too rich for the jewelâ (Thy face too fair in the view)? Was it pleasant, beloved, blasting A hope that was new With wordsâa low murmur of music On lips too sweet to be true? The tale is the tale oft told: Poor theme for a man to bemoan! The eyes are the âwondrousâ eyes of old, The âlovingâ heart a heart as coldâ The self-same stone: And the lips that have lied Are the lips that sighed In low sweet undertone. SPRING-TIME Where chestnuts overhang the stream Our boat shall lie; here may we dream An hour away, and Care may wait. Ah! sweetâ Ah! sweet Thus for one hour to deviate From the rude pathway marked by Fate. Our home is here: the skylark flings His music down, and tiniest things Beat the still air with labouring wings. Ah! sweet the odours, Sweet the song; Sweet to forget, these scenes among, The jarring discords of the throng. Now glide we onward ever slow, And now, in the opal afterglow, Listen, a voice sings clear and low. Ah! sweet the singer; Sweet the strain! Ah when, ah when, tired heart and brain, Will that song gladden thee again? LIMITS Ah, Ladies, that some fairy band Would turn a barren offering Of thanks into a richer thing! The cunning of an artist's hand, The tuneful harp to sing,â These are not mine, nor mine the power In graceful phrase, with studied art, To tell how in a saddened hour, As rain upon a thirsty flower, Kind wishes cheer the heart. Alas, dear friends! could we but train Upon a furrowed legal brow The Muse's sacred laurel boughâ Ah, then I might not strive in vain (Beating an irresponsive brain) To waft in fitting measures now The breath of kindness back again! TOO HARD âThe days will be long,â she murmured: Her tears on his bosom fell. âBut a little while,â he answered, As loth to say Farewell. So the Farewell was not spoken: Her lover crossed the main, And the days were long while she waited, And watched till he came again. Too hard to be spoken at parting! Her lover came back, and they tell How they met, and how sweetly he uttered (After long days of waiting) Farewell. CHARON Charon, thy craft more slowly wends On peaceful Cam from shore to shore, And in thy locks the silver blends With larger freedom than of yore. Thy bended form has little grace (Nimble thou wert in earlier days), And Time has sadly marred a face That few may love and none can praise. We quail before thy searching glance; Nay, bold boat-captains fear thine eye, And tremble, Charon, if perchance They have no little âtrifleâ by. Thou hast a son, a stalwart lad, Some sixty summers he or more, Who, when thy rheumatism's bad, Deftly manÅuvreth the oar. And thou art yet but ninety-sixâ Talk not of leaving us till he (Thy namesake, Charon, on the Styx) Bequeaths his pole to thee. IN THE âLONGâ Youth of the 'Varsity, Flower of the land, Here in a far city Dreary I stand, And pledge thee, and wring (like a âfreshmanâ) A way of demonstrating affection not encouraged in Cambridge. thy hand. Time-honoured Colleges! Classical halls! Seeking for knowledge is The last thing that palls Under the nurturing shade of thy walls! Dwellers in Trinityâ Tempest-tossed Camâ Dons of Divinityâ âLittle-goâ cram Alike are deserving of prostrate salaam. Up in an attic all Corner and slope, Men mathematical Gloomily grope, Of far away Fellowship, fostering hope. Burning to head all lists, Lavish of oil, Prizemen and medallists Ceaselessly toil, Burning, eternally burning for spoil. Slumbering lazily Under the trees, Ofttimes I hazily Ponder of these Sweet youths in their labours for âHonoursâ degrees. Oft in the âVac.,â as I Catch the perfumes Of mingling tobaccos, I Dream of my âroomsâ Haunted by âbedmakers,â beetles, and glooms. Of faces congenial Time-honoured jokes, Of servient menial Sedative smokes Of bountiful âbutteries,â obdurate âoaks.â Youth of the 'Varsity, Flower of the land, Now in a far city Dreary I stand And pledge thee, and wring like a freshman thy hand. CAMBRIDGE LODGINGS, 1877 âI ask not for cleanliness, care not for light, I crave not a wide-spreading view; But I must have my curtains of purple and white, My table-cloth yellow and blue.â âI'm sure, sir, you'll find they are much to your mind, For here is no wide-spreading view; Neither cleanly nor light, nor excessive in heightâ My curtains, moreover, are purple and white, My table-cloth yellow and blue.â âBut I must have a carpet of orange and green. And then, I decidedly think 'Twould add to the general effect of the scene Were the furniture covered in ultramarine, Gamboge and magenta and pink.â âOh then, sir, my rooms, if I rightly assume, Will suit as to colours, I think; There's an oleograph of a 'uge Magdalene All over gamboge, sir, and ultramarine, My furniture covers is pink. âAnd as for magentaâbut pray, sir, to enter And look at the picturs and that: That there's in the Bible, sir, â'sputinâ with doctors,â And that's âlittle Alick,â A disreputable vendor of âdawgs.â sir (one of the proctors), And Longfield, the favourite bat, And a dozen actresses, in beautiful dresses, And a puppy dÃ¨vourinâ a rat. âAnd a great many more, sir, the rent, sir, is L 20.â âMy excellent woman, on questions of rent I Assure you 'tis painful to dwell: Your curtains and carpet, recherchÃ© and chaste; Your pictures, selected with knowledge and taste, Will suit me remarkably well.â MORAL FRAGMENTS For money, or for money's worth, On this unpleasant little earth Most men will sell their souls away; Their bodies too: to barter clay (Unprofitable merchandise) For glittering gold, were surely wise! Says Rochefoucauld: âTrue wisdom brings True knowledge of the price of thingsâ: We're very wise to-day. We're very wise; I think we know The price of all things here below. We know that Vice and Virtue join In having both their price in coin. I knew of Virtue very young, Have heard at least his praises sung; I learned, at quite an early date, To loathe the very name of Vice, And circumspectly estimate How much of goodness would suffice. I learned from pastors, now with Shem, That Heaven's gates seemed wide to them; I learned from pastors, now with Ham, How small a Vice may serve to damn. But I digress, my gentle song Becomes inordinately long. Revenons a nos moutons. The thought to-day occurs to me To write yet once a diary, And therein duly to rehearse, In careful prose, or careless verse, All that may happen day by day, Or wise, or witty, grave or gay: For I, in speculation bold, A pessimistic doctrine hold, And would empirically decide Whether this view be justified By facts observed, or whether men, Who should know better, now and then (Being philosophers) have tried, In sheer malignity, to make My spiritual sponsors quake, To spoil my happiness, to crush The flower of young Hope, and brush The bloom from Faith's pure cheek. And should It prove that I have been misled By cynics (a malignant brood), And all my thinking on this head Was false in drift, and in the letter, And miserably misapplied, All you will say is, âAll the better.â Behold then, courteous spectator, (Reader, I mean) the raison d'Ãªtre Of this my diary. Its aim Is purely scientific: I disclaim All joy in any earthly things Save such as touch the secret springs Of human progress. . . . VALENTINE Not mine the painter's skill to trace With pencil free, in flowing line, And nice detail, a perfect face; A figure cast in mould Divine, Moved with a woman's grace. The poet, in his sorrow blest, May tell with quivering quill Some tender tale of broken rest, And gentle eyes with teardrops fill, And pity fills the breast. Nor is his labour all in vain If heartfelt sighs his bosom wring, And lower notes, and sadder strain, Show distant ages wondering A larger love, a deeper pain. A heavy task; but heavier yet Is grief that finds not any songâ His joy short-lived, and long regret, Who bears his burden in the throng, And seeks in silence to forget. INTROSPECTION Through weary hours I've pondered o'er A something which to write upon; I've lain in frenzy on the floor, And striven to let my fancy soar, And nothing can I light upon! Now shall I write in prose or verse? Or whereunto my powers bring? Shall I in tragic vein rehearse A mother's grief, a father's curse? Or tender tale nore softly sing? Or shall I examine my mind With the night-light of âIntrospectionâ? And then, having made from its innermost part (Where some have a lumber-room, others a heart), Of personal failings selection, Explain to the world in the cleverest novels How the normal mind abnormally grovels. The world of to-day wants âknowledge of selfââ The old true poets are all on the shelf; And he may aspire to bays Who gives to the world without any apology, In metre, a volume of simple psychology. I hope that it will not be long Ere man knows enough of himself, And seeks something better in song. And yet, till the rage passes over, A poet may live in clover, And I willingly join the throng.â âMan, know thyself!â All ye who are groping in college or school, For love or for glory or pelf, Henceforward must follow a different rule: ('Tis well for a man to know he's a fool) Ineffable bathos! Study âthyself.â 'Tis not from his books, 'tis not from his friends (Thank God!), nor his paltriest neighbour, That a man will secure these desirable endsâ This âknowledge of lifeâ that makes ample amends For the life that is lost in the labour. Then turn from thy friends: shun Poetry, Art;â Be vain disputations avoided; Examine, dear reader, thine innermost part; And soon you will think you have fathomed your heart, And know that you haven't enjoyed it. ART AND RELIGION IN CAMBRIDGE, 1874-78 Rock me to sleep! mine eyes have seen Conflicting shades of blue and green! Creator of each subtle senseâ God, Harmony Divine! What agonies acute, intense, Are his who thro' life's long suspense Aspires to taste Divine! Rock me to sleep! the True, the Chaste, The Beautiful, the Good,â All these, with fretting haste, By man uncultured, boorish, rude, Are eagerly pursued, Whilst Thy great gift, the sense of Taste, Lies neglected, unpursued. Rock me to sleep! take, take away Thy servant's sense of sight! Till earth again, in Thine own day, Becomes a âharmony in grayââ Take me to Thee: Let angels lay On aching eyeballs, Night. PART II LIGHT VERSE Many of the following pieces are taken from my second book. WILLY They were talking of love, oh, so wisely! How we slaved for that charity tea! Of love in its âhigher relations,â And âPlatonicâ affection, dear me! But poor little I was too flighty, Contrived on too heedless a plan, Too vain (so they said) and too trifling To know aught of the ideal man. They talked, and oh! I grew sleepy; And the sun streamed in on the pane; And I hardly seemed wanted, and somehow I found myself down in the lane. And then, oh then, I met Willy: He popped from the hedge with his gun: âSo delightful,â he said, âto meet you here, Of all people under the sun.â Yes, would you believe it, 'twas Willy, And his two little dogs, âSmallsâ and âModsâ; I faltered, âAunt Susie will miss me,â But Willy just said, âWhat's the odds!â And he saidâbut, oh that I can't tell you! But he kissed me before he began: He's over six feet, and he's lovely, If he isn't an âidealâ man. My eyes were tight shut, and he kissed me, And âModsâ gave a warning bow-bow; And I screamed, and thought, âWas my hair tidy While Willy recorded his vow?â Then I slipped to my corner demurely, And patted and smoothed down my hair, And wondered if any one noticed, And made up my mind not to care; For I still shut my eyes and saw Willy, While we slaved for that charity tea, And talked of love's âhigher relations,â And âPlatonicâ affection, dear me! IDYLL OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM She moved, admiring students said, Amid the marbles like their queen; He bore, a little high, his head, Aware of God-like mien. 'Tis afternoon: the long slant rays Make hot the dim Egyptian room; Our queen her little luncheon lays On a low sculptured tomb. And now the lad (his dark curls float As if from hers their gold to win) Draws from a worn-out velvet coat A paint-smeared sandwich tin. Love spreads the feast; their lips have met! So grace is said, and lingered o'er! Grey gods, ye smiled! Nor look ye yet All grimly serious as before. DARTMOOR Miss âMegâ stood pawing at the door, As she would question, âWherefore tarry? Brave old Dartmoor I'll put you o'er, Young master, like old Harry.â Then up I took my little crook Ere Time was any older, And Hell-to-split we frolicked it O'er fern and furze and boulder. MY LADY NICOTINE âFair friend of Mine, the lips that taught The trick of blowing rings Must answer for the lawless thought Of kissing that it brings.â What wonder that Love's last recruit For fear of Hope deferred Proceeded then and there to suit The action to the word! âOLD BOYSâ AT AMERSHAM HALL I long have nursed, an old boy I, A gouty leg upon the pillow; Yet was I in the days gone by No mean performer with the willow; And so was asked (no doubt my years Secured for me the invitation) To travel down to X., good sirs, And play the rising generation. I came, I saw, I fielded âpointâ; Till Buggins minimus, by Jingo, Knocked my forefinger out of joint, And chirruped, âHold it, Old Flamingo!â It made me hop! A substitute I signalled with the wounded digit, And that young Buggins (little brute) Ran on like a demented midgit. âRetired hurt,â I sat and told Of ancient days when there was cricket, And Birrell slogged, and Spokey bowled, And Winterbotham kept the wicket. Ripe legendsâ(much improved upon)â I babbled of the great âMatrics,â And how I caught, at long âlong on,â A ball Jim Parry hit for six. I did indeed; âLost ballâ was cried; The hero o'er his bat was bending; When overhead, supremely âskied,â I saw that awful ball descending. And ran, like any acrobat (Three hundred yards if ever man did), And cleared the fence, and had him pat Two inches from the ground, left-handed! I paused, and heard, it touched my pride (It was unfeeling and improper), A fat boy, nicknamed âFull-inside,â Gasp outââJemima, wot a wopper!â LOST FRIENDS Dear comrades! though ye figure not in Lowndes, (Thy costlier brethren long have left their home), How are ye ravished from me, tome by tome, For fewer shillings than ye cost me pounds! Shades of unthrifty authors! Hark, it sounds! My portal tells (a tedious metronome) Of sullen duns who onewhile forced to roam Kit Marlowe, Savage, Johnson, Goldsmith: Zounds! Dim days of quiet pleasure that are fled! Once, snugly harboured, dallying by turns With new and old, in such pure peace I read As one who (want unknowing) idly learns. Now in yon gaping casement widely spread Stand Shakespeare only, Landor, Lamb and Burns. IN CHAMBERS There now, he's coming, tramp, tramp, tramp! Those seventy-two accursed stairs! Certain and slow, I know the scamp, And in a minute (if my prayers Cannot prevent)âit's too late nowâ He's at it; kicking round the scraper: O God! And must I suffer so To get a clammy paper? Ah well, ah well! One day I know (I've watched and waited two years now) A lighter foot, with step less slow, Will touch the stair, and then somehow I shall be certain as the day That that quick step is not to stop Like all the rest (confound the fop!) Down there at Jones's, just half-way. âI shall be by the fire suppose,ââ With my Chaucer in hand, as beseemeth youth, And the smoke will be curling about my nose As I dream, in veriest truth, That Law is no more, and the Junior Bar In Courts of Love all hold a brief, And the fairest of witnesses flock from afar To debate of the âFlower and the Leaf.â And then, ah then, on the wind-swept stair Of this drear old Temple a voice will be heard! The rush of a dress, the trill of an air, The scent of a rose, and the note of a bird! And then, ah then! The book will fly, Dear grand old bard at thy grand old bust; And I shall be there in the wink of an eyeâ She's coming, you gibbering fool!âshe must. So you needn't sit there, with your worldwise air, And prattle Propriety out of a book. âNo lady would sing on a public stairâ? You ass! My girl sings everywhere! And is coming, by hook or by crook! You grinning old reprobate! Stop your tum tumâ âNo ladyââhang ladies! Mine will not be long. I know not her face, but I know she will come! A flutter, a rush, a scent, and a song. TRIOLET If you never write verses yourself, Dear reader, I leave it with you. You will grant a half inch of your shelf If you never write verses yourself. I was damned by a heavy Review, I'm a bit of a critic myself, But, reader, I leave it with you. MY PRETTY MAID Where are you going to, my pretty maid? âI'm going to publish, sir,â she said. Perhaps you've a fortune, my pretty maid? âMy verse is my fortune, sir,â she said. Then you'd better not try it, my pretty maid. There's an item for printing, and when it is paid, There's âCommission on salesââO innocent maid! In your rural retreat, have you heard of THE TRADE? Oh, where are you going to, my pretty maid?

INCIDENT OF THE OFFICE I was sitting and was wondering What was business ever for, When there came a rush of petticoats With a flutter to the door. And a lady entered, flying In a way to make you grin (There were steps she did not notice, For the doorway opens in). She stopped against the stove-pipe With a disconcerted air, And panted, and I asked her Had she not observed the stair? And did she come on business? Or would she like a bun? And she, at first, said nothing For business she had done. Then, speaking very rapidly, She answered, âNo, indeed! I have, in fact, no business, But I lately chanced to read âIn the P.M.G. a poem, And they tell meâam I right?â You are the gifted author, And so I thought I mightâ âI mean, you know, that seeing Your name upon the door, You would excuse my asking Have you written any more?â Then I rose, and thundered, âMadam!â And said sternly, âGod forbid! You are under some delusion, Madam, Vanish!â and she did. And still I sit a-wondering What was business ever for; And I sigh for lady visitors, But they come not any more. LATTER-DAY SONG Had âRobbieâ Burns espied thy lips He'd have kissed them, that I know. We modern men dare no such quips, But slowlier go, And wind about with ill grimace For tardier shows of scantier grace. Could âRobbieâ see the laughing eyes That glint from out their lashes so, They'd have no time for shy surprise ('Twixt âRobbie'sâ kisses, don't you know) With laughter low. He'd kiss, and kiss, and whisperâOh! Sweet words no living bard can show. THE BOOK OF THE RHYMERS' CLUB VOL. II. Had you increased our number, What sweetness might have been Uprising as from slumber We bards, in all thirteen, Amassed this much and lumberâ Sad work without a Queen! Had you increased our number, What sweetness might have been! MALICE Who brought us together that day, Gentle Alice? Whole hours at thy feet I lay: Who brought us together that day? Now, friendly and frank, let us say It was Malice Who brought us together that day, Gentle Alice. AFTER HEINE In penning this epistle You find perhaps relief: But a notice of dismissal, My darling, should be brief. âSOME EMOTIONS AND A MORALâ Yes, yes, you did: with smirk and smile, And smooth persuasion, make it plainâ You oily thing of sin and guileâ That all my hair would grow again. Once Love hid in my golden locks: He stole behind me where I lay, And, oh! the recollection shocks, His kiss met my kiss just half way. And, oh! with arms thrown back I made A frame that his face closely held, And he a tenderness betrayed That my poor tresses had compelled. Oh, what of bliss surpasses this? For one sweet hour to know the pain Of utter love, of kiss on kiss Descending in a golden rain! Ah, one such hour, within my power, A golden shower of kisses fell; And breast to breastâbut, oh! the restâ I must not, dare not, cannot tell. And now, ah now, my heart it bleedsâ From dreams to stony truths I pass To see the tale of Time's misdeeds Recorded in a hateful glass. O stern surveyor! 'neath thy ban I trembling to my knees am brought: My heart is breaking; nothing can Repair the havoc thou hast wrought. ABOMINATIONS No. I of a Proposed Series Of irremediable ills The vilest is the beastly board That booms the fame of Bâm's Pills! Were I of public help assured, I'd rid the land of all such ills: I'd hang the man; I'd burn the board That booms the fame of Bâm's Pills. BY GERARD DOW True, true, very true; but you see It's useless to argue with me. Ascetical scruples? Fiddle-dee-dee! She's there, in the Dresden galleryâ âA girl with a candleââ19câ And any one, worthy to loosen her sandal, Would give, though a belted earl, His total possessions to blow out her candle, I tell you, and kiss that girl! FEB. 14 In boyhood's hour my facile pen Sped lightest love in smoothest lines: Ah, many a bosom cherished then My easy, artful Valentines. But now, ah now, my aching breast Knows deeper love by surer signs Of pain that they have never guessed Who kissed those artful Valentines. A XMAS CARD âNow may the fair goddess Fortune fall deep in love with thee.â Ah, kindest friend, kind words that cheer A path too desolate and drear, When troubled thoughts importune For timid Joy to venture near! Ah, blest indeed if it might be That Fortune were in love with me, As I in love with Fortune. A PRESIDING EXAMINER Emerging from the darkness Of London's sullen frown, I, simulating Majesty, Appeared in hood and gown; Commissioned to examine, According to the Rule, In all that they could cram in, The boys of my old school. I sat in my imposing seat, The papers from me flew: As though my learning were complete, And I all knowledge knew. But oh! despite the hood and gown, Despite the high respect Paid to a mild official frown, Yet had I to reflect That 'neath a borrowed mortar-board Mere ghosts of knowledge dwelt; That false was my pretended hoard, Ah me, how poor I felt! Ah, boys! despite my College, I am a learned man! I 've loads of sorry knowledge Not set in any plan. My wisdom, hard in earning, I'd give it all to know Again what I was learning Now twenty years ago. JEREMIAH AT THE CHESHIRE CHEESE O Heart of man! What ills torment, what passions tear The heart of man! We Rhymers, gathered in a clan, Disconsolate, aghast, declare Thy burden is too hard to bear O Heart of man! SHELLEY AT OXFORD 1811 AND 1893 THE MASTER SPEAKS âThe rebel of eighty years ago Is the hero of to-day.â In this memorial none will know The rebel of eighty years ago. We Oxford dons, however slow, Are now at last compelled to say âThe rebel of eighty years ago Is the hero of to-day.â PREFERENCES âNay,â said the husband, âgive him this,â (In manifest alarm). âThis is her proper likeness, that Has but a sudden charm. âA look that flashes into light, And quickly dies away, May blind some passer; as for me, I love the looks that stay.â And I but said, what could I say? (Not meaning any harm) They're yours, dear friend, the looks that stay; Spare then to me, she surely may, A glance of sudden charm. LOVE AND DEATH FROM ÃSOP Love on a summer day, Faint with heat, And tired of play, Came to a grotto fair, And courted slumber there, And flung his darts away. This was, the Fable saith, The very cave of Death, But this Love did not know. As he had sped a shaft With more than common craft, Once, in his sleep, he laughed, At dawn he rose to go. Love was at parting fain To have his darts again:â O Love, beware, beware, The shafts of Death are there, Of mortal man the bane. But Love cared not a stiver; Intent on human hearts, He gathered to his quiver His own with Death's black darts; And glorious in the morning He winged his golden way; Fair maidens had forewarning That Love was on the way. Strong men, their labour scorning, Did nothing all that day, For dallying with a maiden Is neither work nor play. Old men and women saddened In the dragging of the years, All on a sudden gladdened To laughter and to tears. Love was on earth again, Intending ill to none, (He wotted not of pain, Blind creature of the sun). Not knowing what he did, And restless, till 'twas done, Both young and old He rushed amid And shot his arrows Every one. And some cried out, â'Tis Death he deals,ââ And surely Death did come. But others cried, â'Tis Love, 'tis Loveââ And Love there was for some. SUBURBAN He leaned upon the narrow wall That set the limit to his ground, And marvelled (thinking of it all) That he such happiness had found. There long he sat in perfect peace; He smoked his pipe, he thanked his stars (His stars, unnumbered in the lease), And blest the subterranean cars That bore him nightly back to win The home where he had left a heart, Not trusted in the Devil's din Of London's damned money mart.

PART III TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY MOTHER EARTH AND THE NEW WOMAN Love in my arms lies weeping, His tiny limbs upcurled: Art thou so soon, my darling, Aweary of the world? Come, come, a baby's troubles Are easily redressed: Drink deep, drink deep, my darling, God gives thee of his best. Ah, now about my bosom The tiny hands have curled! To thee, to thee, my darling, The bosom is the world. Love in my arms lies weeping. O God! dear God! recall Thy children to my breast, for here Is nourishment for all. FOR AN IDEAL I looked out over the ocean And saw a maiden stand Where billow and cloud commingled In a vanishing golden land. I passed out over the ocean, And held the Sun-Maiden's hand, And lost for ever the treasure Of Love in my Fatherland. SONG IN THE LABOUR MOVEMENT The voice of Labour soundeth shrillâ Mere clamour of a tuneless throngâ To you who barter at your will The very Life that maketh Song. O you whose sluggard hours are spent The Rule of Mammon to prolong, What know ye of the stern intent Of hosted Labour marching strong? When we have righted what is wrong, Great singing shall your ears entreat: Meanwhile in movement there is song, And music in the pulse of feet! ENVOY Dearest, I have put my life In a tiny book of song; If I speak with halting voice, Yet may broken words prolong The memory of the golden hour When we were given each to each, And in silence, wanting words, Perfect love found perfect speech. PLYMOUTH HARBOUR A SONG Oh, what know they of harbours Who toss not on the sea! They tell of fairer havens, But none so fair there be As Plymouth town outstretching Her quiet arms to me; Her breast's broad welcome spreading From Mewstone to Penlee. Ah, with this home-thought, darling, Come crowding thoughts of thee. Oh, what know they of harbours Who toss not on the sea! UNWORTHY Am I not worthy of thee? O my child, Come close, come close, and nurse upon thy breast My aching brow! Let thy sweet hands be pressed Cool, cool on these hot eyelids till the wild, Ungoverned tumult of my brain is stilled. Close, close, till that sound dies within my ears, And I may cease from questioning with tears Why God has made me love thee; O my child! MARGUERITE Loveth he, or loveth not, All these idle years? An he love me, Laughter; An he love not, Tears. Loveth he, or loveth not? Flower, canst thou tell? Thou shalt deck my bosom An he love me well. Loveth he, or loveth not? Oh, but life were sweet! Say, ah say, âHe loves thee,â Gentle Marguerite! MY LOVE: WHERE ART THOU? My Love, where art thou? Crowding waves Press ever on the strait confine Of the still spirit-haunted shore Where my soul waiteth thine. My Love, where art thou? Once, ah once, Thy vision in the clamorous mart Had drawn me surely from the throng To a chamber set apart Where weaving from its finest strand My spirit fashioned for thy shrine A veil to shroud thee from a gaze Raised unabashed to thine. But now, where art thou? Say not, lost! The sanctuary of thought is bare: The shrine where stood thy picture shows The wan face of Despair. Not âlostââthe low sweet voice that bade Me wait the lapse of dragging years: Not âlostââmy vision in the throng Now dimly seen through tears. IN ACCOUNT WITH TIME Reprinted from The Bookman Time cannot grudge to me The few glad hours I spendâ Glad hours of rare companionshipâ In converse with my friend. My friend thus counsels me: âBe it with Time agreed That thou wilt in my company Seek rest when thou hast need.â Sweet words (if words could soften The pain of parting)ââMay I come indeed as often As I have need?â I say. âTime cannot grudge to me The sure release from pain I have in thy sweet ministry Of solace to my brain.â ANNIVERSARY These five years. Ah, they have shown us one thing plain, These five years. Joy has a deeper spring than tears: Love knows a harbour shut to pain: Dearest, they are not spent in vain, These five years. A DREAM Night brought a dream of loveâ A fond sweet dream of thee; Thy heart beat warm upon my heart; Thy dear arms circled me. Alas! but dawn now shows A cheerless couch to me. 'Twas sleep beguiled an empty heart; My vacant arms sought thee. WITH FLOWERS I know not how in any wise, Dearest, my aching love to show; If flowers have voices these will speak, These flowers I gave you Long ago. And they will whisper, âDay and Night He sheddeth tears of joy to know He has not lost, not lost, not lost The love you gave him Long ago.â IN JUNE Ah, Love, I lack thy kisses In the warm sweet breath of June: I am lonely amid loversâ Love, come soon. A blue sea stretches waveless 'Neath a blue blue sky this June: I am panting for thy love, Loveâ Love, come soon. GREAT EXPECTATIONS Athwart the shadowed path Of Life wherein we tread, How often Beauty hath A ray of sunlight shed! If on my shadowed path She throws her light to-day, I forth shall go with heart aglow, Rejoicing on my way. TO A SWEET SINGER My heart was full the while I wrote The song you sang yestreen. That it would fill so sweet a throat I could not have foreseen. So long as Love is in the land, He rules by right divine: So long will there be fresh demand Of voices sweet as thine. EDELWEISS Above the line Of thawless snows On yonder height One flower grows. And in my bosom Winter-bound Lives one such flower Which thou hast found. OF ME Think, Love, of me. Far from thy side to-night, Think, Love, of me. So shall I absent see, Pictured upon the night, Thy dear face set in light. Think, Love, of me. DAY AND NIGHT I held her hand To-day, And whispered a word, And she heard; And I did not work, And she did not play, To-day. I touched her lips To-night; And none knew, but we two, The delight; And I shall not sleep, And she will not sleep, To-night. WHEN When laughing Joy robs Sorrow Of all her load of thought, The harp and voice may borrow A sweetness yet untaught. To be merry, till the morrow Dawns with its memories fraught, And the tired thief Brings back to Grief Her heavy load of thought. LOST Something has gone. O Life! great giver as thou art, Something has gone. Not Love, for Love, as years roll on, Plays evermore a fuller part. But from the treasure of my heart Something has gone. AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT Fair flowers! the hand I fain would kiss, That so among you lightly moved, To gather thisâand thisâand thisâ The while you nodded and approved. In culling leaves so rare of scent, It was (was it not?) her intent To grace a friendship old as ours With fragrance passing that of flowers? A DOLE The bread I eat Fills me to-day with shame. Lo, here I fling it to the street: Not money: just the bread I eat. O comrades, for your lofty claim Take, take from me, in Freedom's name, The bread I eat. HOMEWARD BOUND In the low pathway of the sun, Far-shadowed on the golden fern, And robed in purple twilight, one Stood and awaited his return; And shone upon him unforeseen As he with heavy step drew near: Ah, then was greeting sweet between Us two old loversâSister dear! PICTURES BY FLORENCE SMALL I.âAUTUMN O Autumn leaves! Bind in thy tresses, maiden fair, These Autumn leaves. See Hope fulfilled in rangÃ¨d sheaves: See in dead Nature Love's despair: For brooding joy, for russet care, These Autumn leaves. II.âTHE POEM Her brow upon thy pages bent, Thy volume, Poet, in her hands; She knows not, she so innocent, How like a pictured maid she stands. Sing, Singer, to thy heart's content! Paint, Painter! shall he rival thee? Twin arts have equal graces lent: So art thou, Maiden, fairâand free. AN UNFINISHED PORTRAIT How shines the gold amid the brown Of heavy tresses tumbling down, In Art's despite! How Nature blends her red and white! Ah, happy painter, it is thine That âsweet disorderâ to confine: If thou shouldst order it aright, Ah, what delight! TO WILLIAM THOMPSON (Dedication to Chambers Twain) Old friend, it was my earliest thought That your name should be written here; For sooth, if Friendship counts for aught, I hold no living man so dear. Yet o'er my pages now I look, And am, for very shame, deterred: Of Love unending tells the book, But of our Friendship not a word. A BIRTHDAY Dear sister, with an idle line, There comes no dainty thing To grace thy dress, to deck thy hair; These may some other bring. Love, of an essence volatile, Will oft elude the string That bindeth sure the decent gift Of formal offering. So in no cumbering parcel tied, But swift, on his own wing, Love, faring forth to gain thy side, Has only love to bring. FRIENDS Hands clasped a moment on the strand: The one must stay, the other go: There is not any sign to show That friends have parted, hand from hand. The years roll on; the two friends stand: The welcome spoken, speech is slow; Still is there not a sign to show Friend dead to friend, as hand strikes hand. IN A BACHELOR'S GARDEN It seems, ah me! but yesterday She plucked, half jesting was she not? And blushed (so near my heart they lay) Yon flowers that pleadââForget-me-not.â Ah, ageing heart! old memories throng! Again, meseems, her kiss strikes hot: Her voice, long mute, bursts into song Who planted that Forget-me-not. A SCIENCE OF HISTORY Think you it would be good indeed (Surveying on the walls of Time The hurried finger trace) to climb The heights of Fancy, and to read The import of the coming years? Or would the load be heavier yet? A paler grief unheeded, wet The Rock of Destiny with tears? QUESTION To one who long a worldly gain In worldly paths has sought, May aught of better worth remain, Save peradventure caught On cobwebs in the brain, Some fragment of untainted thought? TWICE DEAD The spirit ever hath desire To pierce, thro' forms of Friendship, higher, And somewhere gain its promised part Of true communion, heart with heart. Ah, friend of Youth! thy fresh-cut grave Is warmer than the hand you gave: Else were not (strangers many years) Lost friend, lost friend! these tears, these tears. MAGDALENE âYou are a beautiful woman,â he said. Oh, a long night followed that day. The whole long night rang rang in my head His words, and his look as I lay I could not forget. I lay weeping, and vowedâ âI will hold hereafter in trust This Beauty of mine: I will live and be proud, Not humbled, as now, in the dust.â We met, as one meets men, any way, I've met, it may be, men by the score. And talked about nothing, as any one may When one has to spend ten minutes or more. Then partedâa light matter parting with men? But the eyes of this man were aflame in his headâ He gave a great hand, and was silent, and then, âYou are a beautiful woman,â he said. ALMA MATER Lady, my thanks: this night my dream Is of a pathway stretching fair Through meadows bordering a stream, And flowers, thy gift, spring everywhere. By Grandchester, by Trumpington, Our quiet Cam-side pacing slow, At eve I pass, still musing on The unseen years, as years ago. My flower-dream annulling time Gives back the garnered hours to me; Gives back a perished trick of rhyme That hardly shapes these words to thee; Gives crowding thoughts of earlier days:â Lost friend, whose love I ask in vain, I walk the old oft-trodden ways Thy hand within mine arm again. Ah, the old days! The sun sank there: Ah, the old days! Thus sped the hours: But dream-born seems the perfumed air, And of the dream my path of flowers. IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM Reprinted from The Speaker. Dead sage, dead priest, unheard ye call Up from the valleys where ye sleep: Love's clarion soundeth over all; His fires glow from steep to steep. Professor, I have little store Of learning you may fitly seek, I covet no Department's loreâ Egyptian, Syriac, or Greek. But oft I tread these halls alone, And mark where, treasured with the rest, There lies a stone, no common stone. âA fragmentââof a âwoman's breast.â Profess, Professor, all you know! I ask, among the spoils you heap, Has Time a greater thing to show? Have we a holier thing to keep? REMEMBER Remember, love, how Burns would bring His verses to the ingle-side, And bid his dear-loved Jeanie sing, And by that test abide. Then what her ear determined true Her lips gave ringing to the night; And Burns was glad, and surely knew That he had sung aright. Dear love, for me play such a part; If I sing truly thou canst tell: I bring my verses to thy heart; If any enter, it is well. QUESTION The inmost tenant of my heart, Dearest, thou knowest well thou art; But love alone can solve a doubt If I love thee, Love, out and out. GIFTS Take back the song you sang, Love: Take back the gift you brought: Take back the word you gave, Love: Let me only keep the thought That you knew not what you said, Love: You deemed a song was naught: You brought a gift to me, Love; And knew not what you brought. EVER AND A DAY He murmured, âLove, for ever!â She whispered, âand a day?â And I, whose pain ends never, Saw her stand in her bride's array, And knew that her love was for ever, And his false love for a day. G. D. R. 1879 Dearest sister, Sorrow dwells In the home as sound in shells That whisper evermore Along a silent shore: Evermore, and mournfully, The gathered sadness of the sea. 1889 A voice unheard these many years; A face long summers shut from sight; That face I saw, that voice to-night Gave quiet in a world of fears. Sister, ten years may serve for tears; In twice ten years I shall not miss His very look, the ring of his Great voice abideth in mine ears. W. H. WIDGERY âHe worketh still,â Superior to Death's smart, He worketh still. What his spent years could not fulfil I shall endeavour for my part, For ever, living in my heart, He worketh still. TO JOSEPH SKIPSEY With the Book of the Rhymers' Club If I herein have phrased a thought In words that jar not on your ear, I shall be happy: Love has wrought So in my heart that words are naught To me at all, if insincere. Unless with sacred meanings fraught Words are but words. To âperfect praiseâ Is the sole aim of Art: the Thought Of daily bread, too dearly bought, Deters no poetâTime repays. OF QUIET Tired brain, there is a place of rest On the broad bosom of the Land, Where quiet will reward the quest Of Quiet; and the iron hand Of Toil upon the rolling hills Will be unheard.âAh, there shall we Find quiet in the tumbling rills; Or in the tumult of the sea, The quiet that my dream fulfils Of Quiet-aching tho' it be. R. A. LEDWARD, SCULPTOR Mark how with loving hand he wrought Here on the dial that counts the hours Thy sad great figure, wingÃ¨d Time, Set heavy-hearted 'mid the flowers. Ah, even while he wrought did he Close a great bargain with the years The sooner with these flowers to be That for their nurture have thy tears. FOR AN URN She chose to die. Grave here beneath our helpless flowers âShe chose to die.â Alas! the sun forsook her sky What while he gladdened other bowers: She tasted lifeâa few sad hours; And chose to die. ART'S EXTREMES Proudly the father, Lowly the wife, Bends o'er a child sleeping, Dearer than life. Pride speaks in the father, Love is mute in the wife,â âDid ever a painter Paint like Life?â Heavy the footfall, Laboured the breath; One quitteth the chamber Held by Death. His gaze is estranged, All strangely he saithâ âWas there ever a sculptor Wrought like Death?â THE PROTEST OF SPRING O Spring! Say not that She is dead. Green month of bursting flower and leaf Say not that She is dead. For joy of life thy tears are shed; Naught, naught to thee are mine of grief; April! Fling wide thy disbelief That She is dead. LET REST What art was lavished on the bower; What nameless beauty hers for dower; What perfect moments made the hour! They steal like death from room to room; They stifle sobs that break the gloom; They keep the silence of the tomb. Bring up old friends to view the bed; Bring up, with slow, mock-solemn tread, The hired transport of the dead. Let rest the gold that holds her hair; Let rest the ring none else might wear; Let rest the strong man weeping there. LIFEâLIFE Life, life, if murmuring there be Of low estate, or scanty pelf, The plaint upgoeth not from me. Thy toys lie broken on the shelfâ Love swept them with an idle breath: Life, life! Love overmastereth thee: Grant gentle passage unto death. TRIOLET Lo, thy poor ring is broken! These kisses bind for aye. Let but this word be spoken, Now thy poor ring is broken: âTrue love outlasts his token, Yet cannot choose but stay.â Lo, thy poor ring is broken! These kisses bind for aye. THE UNDERSONG To-day shall be no song, Love, Here quiet now with thee; No song holds all my love, Love, So singing shall not be. Let my hands frame thy face, Love; Take this kiss for thy brow; And these for thy tired lids, Love; Ah! tears, not singing, now. Lay thy cheek to my cheek, Love; Rest thy dear hand in mine; Let thy heart search my heart, Love. If it indeed be thine. And let there be no song, Love, Save only this that tells How deep, beneath all singing, Song in the heart upwells. POSTSCRIPT IN PRAISE OF ROBERT BURNS âI could write a capital satire on the world on the back of that Bible; but first of all I must think of supplying myself with food.ââLavengro. My hero Burns is wholly pure at heart? His truly rural moral code is not At one with ours. If urban folks depart From the strait gate of virtue, they have got None but themselves to blame for it: one learns So very young so nicely what to hide! My lady friend who looks askant at Burns Remarks that Mrs. Grundy's skirts are wide; And Mrs. Grundy says that sex asserts Itself so often, in the strangest ways, She is obliged to wear the fullest skirts To screen her darlings from the public gaze. The modern garb effectually conceals The form of woman. How on earth she goes, A little tipsy pyramid on wheels, About her daily business, goodness knows. It was against monstrosities like these That Carlyle's far-resounding bolts were hurled: We live and move (in clothes but half at ease) And have our Being in a ânaked world.â I say again that I in Burns delight, I mean to make his life and work the text Of some eight hundred verses: I shall write Of all within my knowledge that has vext The souls of workers in this land of ours. I say at once, to make my meaning plain, When we have killed the filthy beast that glowers On all our doings, Love will breathe again: And not till then. I do not mention names: The animal in question is of course No stranger to us: when the Devil claims His own, we shall without the least remorse Abandon him, and tell him he may go To Blazes with his beastly money-bags, And learn to play with bosom friends below The game called âRetributionâ when Time flags. So much for the god Mammon. To return: I've written so far, you will understand, By way of practice: if I want to earn A living by it, I must lick the hand Of some one high in officeâsome one hired To make the business of a paper pay. (The trick of self-effacement once acquired One never loses, its professors say.) If God indeed helps those who help themselves, He must have lost all sense of Right and Wrongâ While under His direction Adam delves, No Child of Nature will attempt a song. If in ten dozen books of verse that claim To be called poetry you find But one pure song deserving of the name, Then take the writer in your arms and blind Him with fond kisses. On that fateful day Talk not of money, lest you do him wrong. Put up your purse. Let Love in his own way Do honour to the singer and the song.</field>
