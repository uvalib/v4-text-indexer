To the ryght worshypfull and his synguler good maystres Arthur Hardberde/Robert Vaghane sendeth moste harty gretynge. To you maystres Arthur, my seruyce premysed As reason of ryght, requyreth to recompence Your gentle herte, whiche hath nat despysed Afore this tyme, to take with beneuolence My wrytynges vnworthye, full of vayne sentence Whiche kyndnes consydered, good cause doth constrayne And dewty me dryueth, to do my dylygence With some small gyfte, for to requyte agayne. Your bownteous benygnytie, imboldeth my rudenes This treatyse folowynge, vnto you to dedycate Whiche to myne handes, occurryde doubtles As I on my Iourney, was rydynge but late By a frende of myne, with whom I was assocyate As by chaunce I alyghted, at a certayne place Whiche wylled me than, that I wolde algate Go forth and talke with hym, a lytell space. Than secretly, he dyd vnto me c?myt Agaynst detraction, this dyalogue defensyue For the woman sakes, both necessary and fyt Whan preuye reprehendeth, agaynst them lyst to stryue Of whose vyce the circumstaunce, he playnely doth dyscryue That throughe auaryce, the syn insacyable Detractours swarme, as bees aboute an hyue Where felonous flatery, to them is profytable. I toke the volume, aud rede therin apase And well perceyued at the fyrste syght It was fayned in fauour of one in your case Howebeit I wolde nat aske hym, what she hyght But vnto hym, I sayde anone full ryght what is your mynde, that I herin do shall For fayne I wolde, yf it lay in my myght Your mynde accomplysshe, what soeuer befall. I wolde sayde he, yf it your pleasure were That you wolde vouchsaue, at my hande to take This lytell smale volume, your name for to bere whose fantasye with faynynge, is set for to make Lest slaunder perchaunce, his sharpe sowne out shake To moue me malyce, whiche onely meane test Your name may cause, suche noyses to asslake Therfore present it, where as you thynke best. Than in my mynde, I thought that you were Your cause consydered, and also your estate Moste worthy to whom, I myght sende or bere It to present, or els to dedycate And because it declareth, howe the Pyes do prate And what them causeth, suche pratynge to vse I trust in God, it shall your mynde recreate Throughe to rede it, yf you wyll nat refuse. And of your thankes, to me I requyre No parte at all, sens myne is nat the payne But of your gentylnes, I humbly you desyre That he may haue thankes, that labours doth sustayne And as to my selfe, no thanke I wyll clayme Sens thanke to payne, is euer consequent Yet natwithstandynge, whyle lyfe doth remayne Myne herte and seruyce, shall be at your c?maundement. This Dyalogue, as Dyamonde derely dyght And as a (weke) moste worthely wrought Shynynge with eloquence, as starre doth of lyght Me thynkes that you, of reason moste ought As she that with payne, experyence hath bought Haue in your custodye, as answere for your cause As the free Fawcon, hath you herin taught Your selfe to defende, agaynst pyes and dawse.

FINIS. The Aucthour speaketh. In the moneth of Dec?bre, wh? phebus y? bright with his mocyon had entered in to y? fyrst degre Of Capricorne, whan longe is the nyght And the day tyme, moste in breuytie Than snowes lyeth depe, vpon the hylles hye waters congyled, in to yse harde and thycke Trees, Plantes, and Herbes, seme than to dye Fewe thynges growynge, appere to be quycke The wether moste bytter, with wyndes sharpe and colde Causeth great company, togyther to resorte Vnto the fyre syde, where ale good and olde Merely they drynke, theyr hertes to comforte Early in a mornynge, in this moneth of Decembre From slepe I arose, and to my studye went Before all thynges than, I dyd remembre That tyme of euery man, shuld frutefully be spent At the fyrste by chaunce, I red an oracyon Moste pleasauntly set forth, with flowers rethorycall Descrybynge the monstruous vyce of detraction The dowghter of eunye, the furye infernall Whose pestylent poyson, as cankar doth crepe Amonge all people, in Cytie, Tower, and Towne Bryngynge Innocentes, in to paynes depe And from theyr good names, it doth them cast downe By readynge this Aucthour, I was pensyfe in my harte As one that had proued, his wordes to be trewe Sorowes constrayned me, to lay this boke aparte The remembraunce therof, my paynes dyd renewe Anone I espyed in the Oryent That dame Aurora, to me dyd apeare And the S?ne with his beames, as golde resplendent To our Orizont, began to drawe neare with spede than my studye, and bokes, I dyd forsake Intendynge all thoughtes, from my mynde to expell And towarde a Forest, the way dyd I take Nat far from the partyes, where I dyd dwell In this Forest fayre, as I walked a whyle Beholdynge hye trees, with armes longe and wyde Sodaynly within the space of a myle An Arbour moste pleasaunt, there I espyde To that place of pleasure, for my recreacyon with spede I approched, it made my herte lyght Anone I was taken, with great admyracyon Of all the fayre pleasures, when I had a syght This place was enuyroned, with Hedgyes thre Of Hauthorne thycke, thre dyches depe cast Thre waters there were, whiche I dyd se In to the Arbour by them, as I past Okes that were olde, in the fyrste hedge were growynge And Elmes in the seconde, that large were and longe In the thyrde Hedge, with bowes downe bowynge Many trees togyther, were thruste in a thronge The Ashe and the Aspe, with his leaues that do quake The Boxe and the Beyche, togyther dyd stande The Corke causynge slyppers, to cracke and to crake with the Ewe tre, a defence to this lande The Plane and the Poplar, there I dyd se The Salowe, the Pyne, and the Maple rownde The Holy with his pryckes, and the walnut tre with the Fyr and the Hasyll, hangynge to the grownde In the myddes a Cypresse tre, I dyd espye Borderyd with Olyues, in cyrcle rownde And vnder the Cypresse, downe dyd I lye where benches on eche syde, were made aboue the grownde These trees to beholde, in my mynde I dyd muse Of all kyndes there growynge, and in order set All pleasures worldly, I wolde refuse To haue suche an Arbour, yf I myght it get Suche flagraunt sauours, suche odours swete I neuer felt in the moneth of May Agaynst all dolour, a medycyne moste swete Is to this Arbour, to take the redy way As in this place pleasaunt, my selfe I dyd comforte with sauours soueraygne, and colours good for syght A Fawcon and a Pye, to the same dyd resorte And ouer my heade, in the Cypresse they dyd lyght Great stryfe was betwene them, with argumentacyon Theyr opynyons contrary semed vnto me The Pye prated fast, with moche contencyon And sayde that her sentence, nedes trewe must be. The Fawcon. The Fawcon moste gentyll, with sober behauour Sayde ianglynge wordes, the trouth do nat trye And fewe wyse men, I thynke do fauour The lyghtnes of a pratynge Pye. The Pye. The Pye than answered, with wordes full of yar And sayde, my sayinges I wyll neuer denye Of women I loke, to haue no hyar Nought is theyr nature, theyr wyttes nat worth a flye. The Fawcon. All thynges sayde the fawcon, of Goddes creacyon Deut. 32. Gen. 20. As scrypture recordeth, be perfyt in theyr kynde woman was create, by dyuyne operacyon Perfyt in body, in reason, wyll, and mynde. The Pye. Perfyt? who there sayde the Pye I the pray Perfection in woman, shall neuer take place Vnperfyt she is, and rude alway In body, and in soule, voyde of all grace. The Fawcon. In the olde lawe, thou mayst playnly se Sayde the Fawcon, that Goddes creatures all Be sownde and perfyt, without deformitie A bongler or a botcher, thou c?nest nat God call But yf thou wylt scrypture, leaue and forsake And flye vnto reason, with me to contende In what thynge tell me, dyd God woman make So vnperfyte, that thou canst nat her nature c?mende. The Pye. In her bodye sayde the Pye, she lacketh perfection Both faynt and feble, labours to sustayne Harted as an hen, she nedeth protection She can nother suffre the wynde, nor the rayne. The Fawcon. If strength of body, with houge and great quantyte Preemynence quod the Fawcon, do proue and infer Amonge all creatures, than man in dygnytie To dyuers brute beastes, shulde far be vnder In Lyon, Elephant, Bear, Bull, and Bore Quantyte in bodye, boldnes, strength, and myght In plenty and abundaunce, be sene euermore No man hath lyke, thou mayst se with thy syght Yet these beastes all, be subiect to man For all theyr hougenes, he is hyest in degre wherfore gyftes bodely, nother may nor can Preemynence in nature, proue where they be If shape of body, that semely is in syght If countenaunce comely, yf bewty gyue perfection Than must thou nedes graunt, that woman of ryght Ought before man, be taken in election But corporall qualyties, as bewtye, strength, or shappe Boldnes or greatnes, no proffe can make Of nobylytie in man, in hym thoughe thou them lappe Sens brute beastes of nature, these qualyties take And lyke as theyr presence, no dygnytie can brynge Vnto man nor perfection, so on the other syde Theyr lacke and absence of unperfection nothynge Can proue in woman, in whom they do nat byde. The Pye. Yet humayne perfection, then sayde the Pye In gyftes of the soule, doth chyefly consyst As reason and knowledge, thou c?nest nat denye Nor agaynst this verytye, thou c?nest nat resyst. The Fawcon. I graunt sayde the Fawcon, that the power intellectyue Of the soule, with reason and lyberty of wyll Set man in perfection, as his gyftes prymytyue By helpe wherof, Goddes lawes he doth fulfyll. The Pye. Than proue shall I lyghtly, that woman is Vnperfyt sayde the Pye, and bestyall of kynde Sens these powers spyrytuall, by nature she doth mys And none of them all, in her thou mayst fynde Of knowledge she hath, no more than a Calfe In Iudgement as wyse, as a Capon or a Gander And the trouth of her to speake, in this behalfe Her wyt is apysshe, and in lewdnes doth wander To rayle and to skolde, no tongue she doth lacke To inuent myschyfe, she is nat to seke Of crafte and desceyte, she hath a great packe But in goodnes, her wyt is nat worth a leke. The Fawcon. That woman hath these powers rehersed aboue Of the soule sayde the Fawcon, that adde suche perfection Vnto mankynde, by reason I shall proue That in this matter, shall be her protection Theffect without the cause, can neuer be founde For betwene them, there is mutuall relacyon Let this be of my reasonynge the grounde And harke what shall folowe, in trewe declaracyon Knowledge in lernynge, as in the artes seauen In naturall Phylosophye, and morall also To make dysputacyon, of the bodyes of heauen And of earthly creatures, in theyr places lyinge so Facultyes and craftes, to inuent and fynde out And chaunses to tell, are they come a longe season All these to be theffectes, no man doth doubte Of the intellectyue power, the wyll and the reason.

The Pye. These Examples excell, yf they be vnfayned Sayde the Pye, for women to the starres they extoll In naturall knowledge, nowe am I constrayned To graunt that woman hath, moche in her noll. The Fawcon. I shall proue sayde the Fawcon, that supernaturall Knowledge in woman, may well take place Prophecye I meane, the gyfte celestyall In to the soule infused, by especyall grace Cassandra doughter, to Pryamus the kynge A lady moste fayre, dyd shewe the destruction Of noble Troye, whan it was moste florysshynge That by Parys actes, it shulde come to confusyon The .x.

The Fawcon. The Fawcon than answered, mylde in his mode Sayinge Pye from thy raylynge, thy selfe remoue Chryste that suffered death, racked on a rode Forbyd that euer, thou shulde this proue. The Pye. Proue sayde the Pye, what maystry is this? who put man I pray the, in his fyrste creacyon From Paradyse, that place of pleasure and blys But woman, throughe the Deuylles temptacyon? And therfore doubtles, I may her well call The fontayne and welsprynge, of all calamytie For throughe her pryde, synne orygynall Dyd ysshewe with death, to all her posterytie And lyke as the fyrste woman, Eue I do meane Dyd sowe the sede, of all iniquytie So syth her tyme, women maynteyne All synne and vyce, in moste enormytie wauerynge they be, and syght as the wynde Crewell as Tygres, than Lucyfer more prowde And trust in them, no man can fynde She is no woman, that can lye lowde Of carnall pleasures, they be insacyable In battyll, bluddy bolde Barones for them dye woman to man, was neuer profyttable But full of cost, who can this denye? The Fawcon. A prouerbe proued sayde the Fawcon, I fynde The barkynge of a Curre, no Kynge can restrayne So no man can cause, the malycyous mynde Of the pratynge Pye, from raylynge to refrayne. The Pye. A prater I am called, because I hyt the nayle Euen vpon the heade, than sayde the Pye Whan I say the trouth, thou sayst I rayle Yet my trewe sayinges, thou c?nest nat denye. The Fawcon. Nothynge sayde the Fawcon, is more repugnant Vnto the trouth, than thy sayinges all And that may be proued, by reasones abundant Deduced of pryncyples Theologycall From Parydyse pleasaunt, as thou dost say Gen. 32.Adam was expulsed, with his posterytie That Eue was full cause, I do say nay whom thou dost call, the mother of myserie As Eue Goddes c?maundement, there dyd transgresse So dyd Adam, as the storye doth tell The Sone of a mayde, theyr offence dyd redresse Psal. 14. 6.whose death dyd breake, the brasones durres of hell Nowe for as moche, as dysobedyence Of both our fyrste parentes, Goddes yar dyd prouoke It was nat all onely, the womans offence wherby mankynde, dyd suffer Goddes stroke [illeg.]And as Dyuynes make declaracyon If Adam had neuer, consented to synne In Paradyse mankynde, shulde haue had habytacyon Althoughe Eue before, to offende dyd begynne wherfore thou Ianglar, nowe mayst thou well se Agaynst our fyrste mother, thy vniust accusacyon Seynge that man is proued, cause for to be As well as the woman, of all trybulacyon.

The Fawcon. who is sayde the Fawcon, all tymes at one stay Throughe this worlde wyde, and neuer mutable Man is subiecte, to passyons alway Eccle. 1. His lyfe in this worlde, must nedes be varyable. The Pye. I graunt sayde the Pye, but this is my mynde All women of promysse, be euer vnstable Theyr fantasyes chaunge, and tourne as the wynde And dowble be theyr dedes, this is no fable. The Fawcon. In reuoluynge of storyes, sayde the Fawcon then Of women stedfastnes, moche mayst thou rede On the contrary parte, thou shalt fynde of men That they haue ben false, in worde and in dede what kyngdomes noble? what Cyties of pryce By treason haue perysshed, as Cronycles tell Contryued throughe the false deuyce Of cowharde Captaynes, that there dyd dwell who betrayde the hyghe kynge, our sauyour Iesu Paynes for to suffre, with extreme passyon But Iudas vniust, and treatour vntrewe whiche hanged hym selfe, throughe desperacyon Aeneas with Anthenor, Troye dyd betray And gaue it to the Grekes, that were voyde of compassyon Than perysshed that Cytie, as the storye doth say The treason of those Traytours, caused great lamentacyon Fewe feldes be foughten, without treason I dare say Of one parte or other, fewe kyngdomes be wonne without preuy packynge, for treason doth decay Mo cyties and countryes, than battyll axe or gonne If stedfastnes were stablysshed, substancyally in men And grauytie were graued, in rulers that be lyght If promys were performed, yf the c?maundementes ten Of man were well obserued, both by day and nyght Then constant I myght call hym, but synce y? fayth fayleth And treason with all vyce, in hym hath taken place Therfore hym to prayse, lyttell it auayleth For mutable he is, and tourneth in small space That women be constant, and trewe as fyne stele Examples we rede, of Penoelope And Lucrecya, that sorowes dyd fele Both matrones noble, as storyes do say [illeg.]Hester the quene, fayre Iudyth moste chast As scrypture doth say, theyr people dyd saue From crewell death, whan all hope was past Amonge the men, suche grace God them gaue who can descrybe, with pen or with tonge The constant vertue, of Susan moste kynde Vnto her husbande, the storye is longe Dan.130.21.Math.21In Danyell the Prophet, thou mayst it fynde The mother of the Machabeis, that .vii. were in nombre Exhorted her chyldren, marterdom to take Her stedfastnes caused, all men to wondre No payne coulde cause her, the fayth to forsake [illeg.] 150The woman of Chananee, of Chryst was c?mended For her fayth vnfayned, and stedfast belefe By her prayer deuoute, her doughter was amended That by vexacyon of a Deuyll, suffered moche grefe Of virgynes moste chaste, what nede I to speke As Katheryne, Margaret, and many thousandes mo No Tyrayne coulde cause them, theyr vowes to breke Theyr chastyte to saue, they suffred moche wo Maxci. 140.At Chrystes death, whan the Apostles all Theyr mayster dyd leaue, throughe mutabylytie Men were founde lyght, and trundlynge as a ball In them was no fayth, but infydelytye In one woman than, all fayth dyd remayne when men dyd shrynke, and tourne as the wynde Mary Chrystes mother, it is that I meane No sorowe coulde cause, her fayth to vntwynde Examples for this matter, almoste innumerable I coulde here recyte, yf tyme wolde permyt That women of dede and worde, be ryght stable But here be ynowe, for them that haue wyt. The Pye. Yet women sayde the Pye, be great confusyon Vnto all men, for in batteyll bolde Of blode they haue caused, oft great effusyon Of theyr myschyfe, moche in storyes is tolde. The Fawcon. Thy fables fayned, make small probacyon Vnto thy purpose, the Fawcon dyd say whan dyddest thou rede, in trewe declaracyon That women cause batteyll, by nyght or by day. The Pye. Dyd nat fayre Helene, than sayde the Pye Of Troye the cytie, cause the destruction When the stronge walles, with towers and towrrettes hye By the Grekes dyd fall, and had there subuersyon. The Fawcon. where malyce is raygnynge, there false accusacyon Doth folowe sayde the Fawcon, in felde and in towne Therfore of Troy, thou sayst the desolacyon was caused by Helene, the woman of renowne Dyd nat Alyxaunder, his lust to fulfyll Sone to kynge Pryame, by strength steale away Fayre Helene from the Grekes, agaynst her owne wyll whan she her handes wronge, howe c?nest thou say nay If wepynge teares, yf syghes sore and sad If lamentacyon, myght then haue preuayled Fayre Helene had escaped, Parys moste mad From Grecye in to Troye, with her whan he seased And thoughe battyll bloddye, with murder moste myserable Betwene these two nacyons, enshewed to theyr payne The adulterar it caused, by dede detestable whiche coulde nat from lust, his body restrayne what mountayne myghty, what sees roughe and depe Haue men passed throughe, as beastes without wyt Theyr raygynge hath caused, good women to wepe with vyolence constrayned, theyr lust to admyt Suche myschyfes many men, oft haue procured And yet they cesse nat, the same to support As towchynge this matter, I am full assured All theyr madnes fully, I can nat report. The Pye. I can report than, sayde the Pye That women be crewell, and loue to be in stryfe Cursed as Cayn, thou canst nat denye Angry as the waspe, wedowe, mayde, and wyfe. The Fawcon. The fayre Fawcon answered, with wordes y? were wyse Sayinge Pye thou arte peuysshe, and blynde as a blocke No man with reason may the suffyse Thy malyce is meruaylous, and styffe as a stocke Thou raylest agaynst reason, whan thou dost impute Yar vnto women, with crewell condycyon For vnto the contrarye, I shall dyspute Theyr pacyence and pytye, in perfyt dyleccyon ArystotleHeate causeth yar, in man and in beaste Of yarfull herte, crewelnes doth sprynge where crewelty doth dwell, compassyon hath no rest ArystotleFor contraryes togyther, can haue no bydynge what causeth fearsnes, in Lyon, wolfe, and beare In Bores that be brym, and mastyffes moche of myght whiche all in theyr raygynge, in peces rent and teare Theyr prayse that they take, by day or els by nyght what moueth man, so fearse for to be And crewell of dede, as beast wod and wylde But heat causynge yar, whan he without pytie In war doth destroy, the mother with the chylde And lyke as heate feruent, yar doth inflame In man and in beaste, and crewell them doth make So coldnes contrary, crewelnes doth tame Causynge man and beast, to shyuer and to quake women in theyr nature, be colde as a kay In respect of men, wherfore inclynacyon To be yarfull or crewell, from them is a way And petye moste tendre, in them hath habytacyon who is so sad, of crewelnes to here In spoylynge or murdre, as these women be For frayes and for feyghtynges, they make heuy chere Vpon euery m?nes hynderaunce, they take great petye what wepynge teares? what sore lamentacyon Luce. 23. Dyd women make, in Hierusalem Vpon the lambes death, takynge compassyon That borne was of mother, and mayde in Bethleem Mat. 20. But men at that tyme, as beastes raygynge mad Theyr hyghe kynge and maker, dyd nayle to a tre At that season tell me, whyther men had Lyke vnto women, compassyon and petie. The Pye. Admyt that thy reasones, dyd fully conclude For women sayde the Pye, as thou dost infer Yet profyte from them, thou must nedes exclude Theyr husbandes they brynge, in det and daunger Ease they loue all, to labour they dysdayne wasters they be of money, meate, and cloth And from the blacke boll, they can nat refrayne To speake all I knowe by them, I am loth. The Fawcon. I am full loth, the Fawcon dyd say Vnto the Pye, suche raylynge to here Nothynge is trewe, thou speakest here this day Thy fables be fayned, and false this is clere A womans offyce, as Arystotle tought [illeg.] 30In his Econymyckes, is redy for to make Suche thynges for sustynaunce, as to her be brought Her famylye to fede, that paynes and labours take All rychesse procured, by nyght or els by day Throughe the m?nes trauayle, in felde or in towne The wyfe with her wysdom, must kepe from decay And suffer no proffyte, in losse to fall downe By practes I proue, in places as I passe The prudent polycye, in suche gubernacyon Of women that wysely, the worlde do compasse In moste honest maner, to theyr c?mendacyon what labour of bodye, do they oft sustayne what breke of slepe, whan they shulde rest take with honestye theyr husbandes, and house to mayntayne These thynges to fulfyll, no paynes they forsake Men dyuers I haue knowne to wast, spyll, and spende At drynkynges and games, suche rychesse as they had whan women full busylye, dyd labour to amende Theyr husbandes lewdnes, that made them full sad wherfore sens women, theyr dewtyes do fulfyll As I haue declared, without fayned fable They rayse without reason, and speake all at wyll That say vnto men, they be nat profyttable Cryinge in his cradell, at his fyrste begynnynge whan man doth lye rocked, nat able to stande who doth hym than fede, with meates nurrysshynge But woman that to helpe hym, doth put to her hande who can women lacke, in syckenes or in helth To wasshe and to wrynge, and meates to prepare A comforte they be, in pouertie and welth Vnto all men, to whom they repare Gen. 20.And therfore Scrypture, doth woman call An helper to man, in euery dystresse whan fortune fayleth, and causeth hym to fall Chyfe remedye she is, of all his heuynesse And thoughe thou Pye pratynge, by vniust accusacyon All kyndes of vyce, to women hast obiect Yet in all vertues, they haue delectacyon And therfore of God, I thynke them elect Humble they be, and lowly in harte Pytefull and pacyent, with sobre behauour And contynence from them, doth neuer departe with dylygence for vertues, they do euer labour. The Pye. Howe canst thou them vertuous, and chast of lyfe call Sayde the Pye, that men by subtyle prouocacyon Moue vnto vyce, and cause them to fall No deuyll vnto woman, is lyke in temptacyon Meandre the flude, that maketh men to muse And laboryous labyrynth, that Dedalus deuysed Suche wyndynges and tournynges, neuer dyd vse As women in temptacyon, for men haue contryued All gyftes of nature, they inclyne to prouoke Man vnto pleasure, and his reason to blynde And with Cupydes darte, to gyue hym a stroke Thus cleane and fresshe men, in bondage they bynde Theyr countenaunce smylynge, as the messenger of loue Theyr eyes moste wantonly, euer roll and turne Vpon syghtes semely, and all thynges aboue Because loue them burneth, they desyre to burne Theyr handes and fyngers, for this they kepe whyte Dasshed full of rynges, with many a precyous stone To shewe theyr prety fete, they haue great delyte On theyr toes howe they tryppe, to se it is alone They laughe, they speake, they synge, they daunce The lustes of loue, in youth to inflame Theyr garment? be garnysshed, after the guyse of Fraunce And to vse paynted wordes, theyr tongues be nat lame Theyr brestes they lay forth, as a Boucher doth his flesshe To be solde in the shambles, and ouer them they lay A fyne lase of sylke, with an owche that is fresshe Or els a small chayne, that was gotten in theyr play And as an horse mayster, that to a fayre doth brynge His Horses all platted, the mane and the tayle So women theyr hear, as golde wyre shynynge They wrappe, plete, and plat, yonge louers to assayle P. ad.Timoth.20.But Paule vnto Tymothe, a document doth gyue Vnto all women, suche lyghtnes to despyse 1.

The Fawcon. Stop there sayde the Fawcon, and harke to me a season For thy braggynge bostes, lyghtly I shall make base And declare vnto the, by inuyncyble reason That delyberate dyscrecyon, in the doth take no place Shameles thou arte surely, thus shamefully to speake That man to vyce is moued, by womans prouocacyon For women of cleane lyuynge, be oft moued to breake Theyr chastytie by churles, that chafe them by temptacyon what paynted wordes, womans loue to allure what tokens that be trycke, do these men vse what rynges, what hertes of golde fyne and pure whiche women do vtterly contemne and refuse And whan by suche tokens, men can nat obtayne Theyr purpose and wyll, than they do inuent Letters of loue, expressynge theyr payne And preuely by messengers, they be forth sent If letters be contemned, yf wrytynges take no place Than labours do louers, in theyr owne persons take They ryde and they ronne, many myles in small space And moue honest women, chast lyfe to forsake with syghes semynge sorowfull, theyr foly they expresse with wepynges theyr wordes, be myxed for to moue Pytefully complaynynge, of deadly dystresse Thus women to deceyue, all wyles they do proue But yf all theyr glosynges, theyr matters can nat spede If theyr tokens with theyr trynkettes, &amp; letters be despysed Than oft constant women, they brynge in great drede whan by vyolent oppressyon, they haue them defyled Dyna that to Iacob the Patryarke, was doughter Gen. 34.

The Pye. Thou rellest vp a rastall rabble, sayde the Pye Of wytles women, whom sayntes thou wylt make what recorde hast thou, thy wordes to ratyfye For without wytnes, as lyes I them take. The Fawcon. A rabble sayde the Fawcon, of raylers I may call wherof thou arte one, but of Sayntes in the blys Of heauen nowe hauynge, the lyfe immortall Theyr nombre a company, moste gloryous is And to proue that these virgynes, rehersed before In the cytie celestyall, haue theyr habytacyon And in Goddes presence, shall be for euermore The Authorytye of the Churche, I brynge for probacyon. The Pye. Ha ha here is a prety pastyme, sayde the Pye To here y? m?ble thy munpfynge, &amp; dronken dotterd dreames As moche aucthorytye, they haue surely As an eles tayle, whan it styrreth in streames. The Fawcon. Nother the ele sayde the Fawcon, nor yet the eles tayle Aucthorytye haue, for reason they do lacke But auncyent storyes, of aucthorytye can nat fayle And that for to proue, I shall nat shrynke backe And tell me nowe Pye, who fyrste buylder was Of royall Rome, who made the walles stronge That large were in heyght, and wyde in compas And who made that domynyon, so large and so longe. The Pye. Romulus was fyrste founder therof, sayde the Pye Of whom Roma it was called, as wryters recorde Scipio and Cato, Rome dyd amplyfye And Iulius Cesar, her fyrste Emperour and Lorde. The Fawcon. If thou wylt sayd the Fawcon, that I shal credence gyue Vnto thy wordes, than wytnes I must haue For wytnes of all men, that in this worlde lyue Is euer accepted, the trouth for to saue. The Pye. Of Hystoryographers, many there be Sayde the Pye, that the Romaynes gestes do declare whiche my sayinges, shall recorde abundauntlye The trouth thou mayst lerne, yf to them thou repare And to be breue, of many I brynge one Titus Linius, myne Authour in this case Of no small aucthoryte, in myne opynyon For his wordes amonge lerned men, do euer take place And acceptynge of a worke, aucthoryte doth make And gyue to the same, the strength of recorde wherfore the wytnes of Linius I take Thy doubte to dyssolue, and deley thy dyscorde. The Fawcon. Stop there sayde the Fawcon, I haue myne intent whan a worke (as thou sayst) of the people is receyued Than hath it aucthoryte, and as a foundement Infallyble is taken, of verytie conceyued The storyes of the Churche, by chrysten men compyled That excellent were, in learnynge and in lyfe Of crysten men, as verytie vndefyled Haue euer ben taken, without any stryfe They be receyued, ergo I may conclude Vpon thy wordes, that aucthorytie they brynge And from my sayinges, all fables the exclude As touchynge the examples, of womens good lyuynge But nowe to retourne, after longe dygressyon To our matter intended, myne examples declare That men moche haue vsed, crafty instygacyon women to wrappe, in the deuylles net and snare And as prouocacyon, hath ben in tymes past Of men moche vsed, the cl?nes to subuert Of women contynent, so suche as lyue chast Be nowe prouoked, from cl?nes to auert They be nat women, that theyr gyftes do abuse Of nature and of grace, and to vyce them applye But men moste sensuall, that studye and muse Dayly theyr lust to fulfyll in lecherye Nowe I pray the Pye playnly, as it is in thy thought Speake here thy mynde, whyther more doth prouoke The man that doth seke, or the woman that is sought The trouth herof shulde cause the, thy raylynge to reuoke Dost thou nat dayly, with thyne eyes se Howe men mased with loue, to women make shute And on the other parte, fewe or none they be Of women to whom suche vyce, thou mayst impute. The Pye. Nowe am I constrayned, to graunt sayde the Pye By reason and experyence, that all prouocacyon Of man c?meth c?menly, for I can nat denye Of thy sayinges and examples, the suffycyent probacyon But yet for theyr rayment, all gorgyous and gay Reprehended of the Apostles, both Peter and Paule In excuse of the werars, what canst thou nowe say If this matter thou defende, than wyse I the call. The Fawcon. Full sharpe be the sayinges, sayde the Fawcon in dede Of these two Apostles, that rayment reprehende And deckynge of women, yet yf thou take good hede Thou shalt fynde that women, they lyttell dysc?mende Saynt Austen to these sayinges, answere doth make Augusti. Of both these Apostles, and sayth that none offence Ryseth of rayment, whan women do take Vnto dyscrecyon, dylygent aduertence If after the custome, of theyr countrey they vse Rayment ryght royall, and accordynge to theyr state Secludynge vayne glorye, yf they do refuse All purpose in louers, lust carnall to instygate Than synne is auoyded, for who so decked was In garmentes moste gorgyous, as Hester the quene As the beames of the S?ne, shynynge throughe the glas with golde and perles, to glyster she was sene Euen so dyd Iudyth, her bewtye augment with apparell of great pryce, that caused admyracyon Yet these women both, for theyr good intent Of scrypture deserued prayse, and c?mendacyon. The Pye. Thou semest sayde the Pye, all maner to c?mende And vse of rayment, be it neuer so vayne Yet Paule vnto Tymothe, dyd vtterly intende All women from vanytie, in rayment to restrayne. The Fawcon. Nothynge I thynke lesse, sayde the Fawcon I the tell Than agaynst the sayinges, of Paule for to speake All vanytie in rayment, the Apostle doth repell All vanytie in the same, my mynde is to breake. The Pye. Be playne in thy termes, sayde the Pye I the pray And dystynctly declare, what thy meanynge is By vanytie of rayment, for nothynge can I say To the yf thy mynde herin, I do mysse. The Fawcon. So oft sayde the Fawcon, as women rayment vse Agaynst the guyse of theyr countrey, or aboue theyr degre And power be decked, so oft they take and chuse In werynge theyr apparell, folysshe vanytie Vanytie in rayment, also I do call Whan for prayse or vayne glorye, rayment is worne Or els to prouoke, and cause men to fall In to lust of the body, whan reason is forlorne. The Pye. Do nat women sayde the Pye, theyr rayment abuse All these foure wayes, whiche thou dost expresse In moste vayne maner, thou canst nat excuse Herein the femyne sexe, nor theyr lyghtnes redresse. The Fawcon. I knowe nat sayde the Fawcon, the surety to say That any so lyue, but yf thou suche fynde what canst thou infer, nowe in the way Of reasonnynge, agaynst the whole kynde. The Pye. If one be nought, so be all the rest I say sayde the Pye, of the femyne gendre For amonge them all, she that is best Wolde be loth of her lyfe, a reckenynge to rendre. The Fawcon. In raylynge vnreasonable, thou ragest agaynst ryght Sayde the Fawcon, whan thou dost of fewe womens vyce Infer all the rest, in theyr lyuynge to be lyght If thou harken thy blynde erre, shall be open at a tryce Some men be murderers, shulde I therfore call All mankynde murderers, some theues and traytours be Shulde I therfore say, all men do fall In to the same vyce? no that were madnes playnlye Gen. 40.Because Cayn dyd murdre, therfore dyd his brother Mala. 1.Abell the same, Esau was reiect Ad to. 90And forsaken of God, in the wombe of his mother was therfore Iacob refused of God, and also neglect Horryble heresyes, these blynde sayinges be If they be defended, and by scrypture confounded And who is so blynde, but he may well se That these saying? agaynst wom? of reason, be nat gro?ded For what raylynge heretycke, so shameles canst thou fynde To say that our Lady, the virgyne moste pure was lyght in her lyuynge, or corrupte in her mynde Because pleasure some women, to lust dyd allure Cesse therfore thy sayinges, and raylynge moste rude Condemne nat a multytude, that innocent is As thoughe from all goodnes, thou woldest them exclude Because that a fewe, be founde to do amys Because that a fewe, be both lyght and vayne In rayment and apparell, agaynst the Apostles rule Thou mayst nat therfore, of the whole flocke complayne As thoughe euery woman, from vertue dyd recule But many there be, to sayinges euyll so prone And dayly in the same, accustomed to slepe That slaunders causynge many, to syghe and to grone As pastymes they take, whan Innocentes do wepe. The Pye. Yet the mayster sayde the Pye, may lawfully speake Of his seruaunt his pleasure, be it false or trewe Lyke maner the husbande, doth nat Goddes precept breake whan he is wyfes sorowes, with slaunder doth renewe. The Fawcon. Blynde was the fyrste erre, and euen naked nought But this is moche worse, sayde the Fawcon in very dede Chryste that m?nes soule, with his death derely bought Forbyd that this erre, come in chrysten m?nes crede Dost thou nat fynde, daclared in Scrypture That Chryst is the fountayne, of trouth and verytie Ioh?nes 140. That man hath by grace, he hath by his nature This trouth is the way, to the celestyall cytie As trouth man to heauen, doth condyth and guyde So by falsenes and lyes, that nocyuous be Slaunderers sodaynly, to hell slyp and slyde where euer they shall rest, in carefull calamytie For Dauyd the prophet, in his Psalme doth recorde Psal. 14. That sclaunderars and lyars, to endles perdycyon Shall fall by iust sentence, of the heuenly lorde whan synne shall be rewarded, with ryght retrybucyon Sapt. 1.The wyse man also, beareth wytnes to this matter And sayth that the mouth, the soule doth sley and kyll Of that man whiche delyteth, of sclaunders to clatter And the names of good people, with detraction to spyll Nowe for as moche, as deedly detraction To all people is dampnable, no state or degre Excepted at all, therfore dredefull dampnacyon All men deserue, that of theyr wyues sclaunderars be And it is c?monly sayde, that on the deuyll to lye Offence and synne it is, is it nat than offence Agaynst crysten women, with sclaundars out to crye Of whose gentyll nature, man shulde speake in defence Ad. eph. 5.Paule sayth that man, shuld loue his wedded wyfe As his owne body, and cherysshe her alway Agaynst Paule they do playnly, that loue to be in stryfe With theyr wyues, whose names with sclaunder they decay Peace therfore Pye, and this opynyon peuyshe That men may rayle theyr pleasure, speake thou no more For sclaunder is a matter, of all other moste theuyshe The offence therof doubtles, deserueth sorowes sore And yf blynde affections, thou woldest set asyde And eluyshe enuye, from thy herte cleane expell Than woldest thou say, that reason in men doth nat byde That with raylynge, the fame of women hurte and quell For in case that any, be founde lewde or lyght In so great a nombre of women, as there is Thou mayst nat at theyr vyce, geast or rayle by ryght But be heuye and sorye, for suche as do amys And in this behalfe to say, I dare be bolde That none, the hole kynde of women doth sclaunder Excepte he be suche, as was nought yonge and olde And blyndly by vyce, lyueth in the deuylles daunger. The Pye. I graunt sayde the Pye, that sclaunder is nought And lyghtnes in iudgement, that causeth moche wo But yf mens lyues &amp; womens, were to the bothom sought Of men than of women good, thou shuldest fynde mo. The Fawcon. This doubte to dyscuss, to no man it pertayneth Sayde the Fawcon, for God this matter must trye But experyence, and also scrypture me constrayneth The rather to women, in this behalfe to wrye For scrypture me teacheth, that all kyndes of synne More by man than woman, had rote and begynnynge And practyse doth proue, that contynuaunce therin Of men moste chefely, hath eade and mayntaynynge The fyrste murdre by croked Cayn, was c?mytted Gen. 40. whan innocent Abell, to death he dyd dryue Incontynent Lamech, began admytted Ibidem. For agaynst stymulacyons, he wolde nat stryue Noe fyrste dronkarde, whose fylthynes his chylde Gen. 90. Cham dyd dyscouer, his bretherne it perceyuynge Abhorred that dede, wylfull and wylde And couered the preuyties, cause of theyr conceyuynge Fyrste tyran was Nemrath, fyrste ydolater was he Genesis. 10. &amp; 11. He set nought by God, by his lyghtnynge, nor his thondre The tower of Babell he buylded, that all men myght se Than deuyded were the tongues, that made men to wondre The synne agaynst nature, both brute and bestyall Men fyrste dyd c?myt, as scrypture doth recorde Gen. 19. Of .v. Cyties the people perysshed, great and small In punysshement of that synne, by the hyghe kynge &amp; lorde Pharao of Egypt, that Tyran styfe and stowte Exodi. 1. Fyrst Innocentes dyd murdre, and to death dyd them dresse For the murdre of those chyldren, he dyed without doubte Exo. 14. The red see hym swalowed, with his people more and lesse And lyke as these offences, had fyrste orygynall Begynnynge of men, so contynuaunce they haue Of men moste chyfely, whiche dayly to them fall From enormyties they labour nat, theyr soules for to saue For who doth kyll and murdre, in batteyll that is bolde who robbeth and spoleth, both by see and by lande who Tyr?ny doth vse, that maketh hertes colde who Innocentes doth kyll, with a bloddy hande who? but man set on myschyfe this vyce doth c?myt As lewdnes were lawfull, all vyce he doth take In the snare he lyeth slepynge, the knot is fast knyt No kynde of cryme croked, he wyll forsake In Sessyons and in Cyes, who is periured but he Great othes that be odyous, no man refuseth And lecherye is laudable, in euery degre Both symonye synfull, and vsurye man vseth And althoughe some women, to these synnes do fall Aboue rehersed, yet in respect of men Theyr nombre is nothynge, or els very small For agaynst one of them offendynge, of y? tother there be ten. The Pye. I thynke sayde the Pye, that thy sayinges nowe be Indyfferent agaynst men, for practyes doth expresse That fewe of these vyces, in women we may se whiche thou hast rehersed, but in men they be doubtles For murdre and robrye, that openly is done Symonye, vsurye, and treason vntrewe Brybrye that chaungeth, that iudge as the mone Heresyes and scysmes, that dyssencyon do renewe Periurye and rybawdrye, with pollynge and oppressyon All these synnes sensuall, that fowle and fylthy be Of man be moche vsed, I must nedes make confessyon Moche more than of woman, that from these semeth fre. The Fawcon. Yet man at his daunger, as thoughe well he were Doth laughe sayde the Fawcon, so synne doth hym blynde If his synne he dyd se, than chaunge wolde his chere Perceyuynge to his maker, howe he is vnkynde His breast he wolde beate, for mercye he wolde call For his dedes of dampnacyon, he wolde knele on his kne And many salt teares, from his chekes than shulde fall If he his workes wycked, dyd ponder as they be. The Pye. As it ought to be sayde the Pye, thou dost speake But as thou dost speake, so shall it nat be whyle man is here lyuynge, Goddes lawes he wyll breake Cease therfore thy sayinges, by the counceyll of me. The Fawcon. Than shall I retourne, to make repetycyon Of our matter fyrste moued, sayd the Fawcon in this place Thou saydest that all women, do lacke perfection Of body and theyr soules, be voyde of all grace A pertlye I haue proued, that as perfyte they be In body as man, and theyr soules haue creacyon Vnto the ymage, of the hyghe Trynyte Thus perfyt they were create, by dyuyne operacyon That depenes of wyt, with reason profounde In women take place, myne examples expresse For the .vii. Artes lyberall, had theyr fyrste grounde And inuencyon by women, this is doubtlesse Aptnes also, and pronytie they haue Vnto all kyndes of vertue moste pure with dylygent endeuour, they haue laboured to saue Theyr soules from all vyce, and grace to procure And furthermore Pye, I haue made declaracyon That women in lyuynge, the men do excell Confounded I haue, thy false accusacyon And reasones I haue vsed, thy raylynges to repell Of scrypture somtyme, the sayinges I haue sought Hystoryes profane, and experyence moste sure The documentes of Doctours, forth I haue brought For the femynyne sakes, theyr ryght to recure. The Pye. By thy processe sayde the Pye, as I can perceyue Thou concludest all women, vertuous to be Because that a fewe, vertues dyd receyue wherof examples, thou dydes recyte to me At the length thou dost take, for fynall conclusyon That women in theyr lyuynge, far men do excell As thoughe they alonely, of grace had infusyon This vtterly from men, grace thou wylt repell. The Fawcon. Nat so sayde the Fawcon, for that is nat my mynde Grace from all men, vtterly to exclude Nor by myne examples, thou canst nat fynde That all women vertuous, I entende to conclude But this conclusyon, of all my sayinges take That to knowledge and vertue, women apt be And yf of theyr lyues, comparyson thou make More godly than men, they seme vnto me. The Pye. Theyr proctour thou arte made, sayd the Pye I perceyue A rewarde to receyue, theyr parte thou dost take But whan they with doblenes, shall the deceyue I thynke than this offyce, thou wylt forsake. The Fawcon. The trouth to defende, why shulde I refuse A proctour to be, the Fawcon dyd say Innocentes to helpe, we shulde our wyttes vse In theyr causes iust, and helpe them alway None other rewarde, to receyue I desyre But trouth to trye forth, and malyce to subdue This brought to passe, than haue I my hyre For than shall be knowen, the false from the true And where as by doublenes, I shall be deceyued (As thou sayst of women) that can nat so be For doublenes of those, is neuer conceyued In whose hertes is playnes, and symplycytie. The Pye. I se sayde the Pye, with the to contende Agaynst the femyne gendre, I am moche vnable As one ouercome, therfore I make an ende For lytell it auayleth, before the to fable. The Fawcon. Yet one thynge of the, or thou from hens flye I demaunde sayde the Fawcon, what moued thy mynde In all thy sore sayinges, so shamefully to lye with raylynge outragyous, agaynst woman kynde whyther theyr nature, theyr wordes, or theyr lyuynge Thy tongue haue prouoked, to deadly detraction Or rather by rashnes, of enuye procedynge Theyr fame to defaulke, thou hast delectacyon. The Pye. Theyr nature is good, than sayde the Pye And so be theyr dedes, the trouth for to tell Malyce me moued, of women to lye Syster to Megera, the ragynge fende of hell. The Fawcon. why dost thou than women, more than men sclaunder The Fawcon dyd say, with thy wordes that be wylde Sens men by dedes deadly, lyue in more daunger Of soule than women, whiche seme vndefylde. The Pye. The lowest parte of the hedge, is troden downe Vnder fote sayde the Pye, whan the hyest is forborne womans power is small, in felde and in towne Therfore I them sclaunder, therfore I them skorne Men rule and gouerne, by see and by lande Promocyons and profytes, by them I may haue Therfore to catche somwhat, in to my hande I laude them, I flatter them, whan I begyn to craue He that wylleth with welth, in this worlde leade his lyfe Placebo he must play, his kne both bowe and bende Flaterars fare of the best, and lyue without stryfe whan playnes with trouth, great men do offende Theyr appetytes to please, my mynde I applye As they say I say, be it wronge or ryght Somtyme I graunt, somtyme I denye Yonge Rufflers to please, whose wyttes be full lyght. The Fawcon. Than yf thou shuldes playnly, and as the trouth is Thy mynde agaynst men, sayde the Fawcon expresse Rebuke they shulde haue, of prayse they shulde mye And thy style agaynst women, than woldes thou redresse. The Pye. I graunt sayde the Pye, but yet adulacyon Nedes must I vse, great men to content And agaynst women, my c?mon detraction These two to contynewe, is my full intent Auaryce of mynde, that is insacyable Adulacyon to vse, hath gyuen me occasyon And so hath enuye, the vyce detestable Prouoked detraction, with false accusacyon. The Fawcon. The Fawcon moste fayre, moche moued in his mynde Agaynst the Pyes wordes, and open confessyon with syghes sore, ascendynge from his herte kynde In lamentynge maner, made this exclamacyon O worlde moste wretched, O tyme infortunate O blyndnes moste beastlye, O lyfe without lyght O vertue, O grace, from mans soule seperate The dedes of darknes, haue put forth his syght Nowe reason is blynded, by synne sensuall And iudgement corrupte, by offence customable wyll wandereth wyldly, by appetyte carnall All powers of mans soule, be founde reprouable Flaterars moste false, that fables can fayne Great men accept, and to counceyll take Playnes and Iustyce, be exyled cleane And oppressyon causeth, Innocentes to quake Extorsyon is extolled, and rygour doth rule Detraction and derysyon, with nobles do dwell Verytie and petie, from these men recule And falsenes with flatery, trewe playnes do quell All these seme lawfull, to men that be of myght Theyr wylles and pleasures, they take for a lawe with ragynge and raylynge, they ronne agaynst ryght For smal is theyr lernyng, theyr wyttes nat worth an hawe O Pye moste peuysshe, howe canst thou suche prayse And Innocentes condemne, whose dedes deserue lawde The hertes of playne people, thou dost dysease whiche couet in trouth, to lyue without frawde But seynge my sayinges, can take no place In hertes that be harde, congelyd with vyce No remedye I fynde, but prayer for grace That man from his synne, may wake and aryce. The Aucthour. whan these wordes were spoken, the Fawcon toke flyght The Pye for to punysshe, that fled fast away Of them both shortly, I lost there the syght And whomwarde I walked, from that Arbour gay Anone I drewe forth, the argumentacyon Of these two byrdes, the Fawcon and the Pye As you haue harde me make recytacyon Nothynge from theyr sayinges, my style I dyd wrye The people to profyte, my purpose is playne No man to dysplease, with worde or with wyll But deadly detraction, I wolde restrayne That causeth many men, theyr soules for to spyll The prynce of peace pearles, the lambe immaculate That suffered sorowes sharpe, synne to suppresse And with his blode, wasshed our soules c?camynate Apoc. 1.

AMEN. Finis. Robert Vaghane to the Fawcon. Folowe? no O Fawcon, to faynte the with flyght In pressynge thy pynyons, to punysshe the Pye Syt styll sobrely, and thou shalt se with thy syght The tyme that Innocentes, theyr owne trouth shall trye whan reason reygneth, that ryght wyll nat reprye And plantyth Prudence, suche poyntes to ouer se Than shall wauerynge fortune, her whele tourne awrye And the pratynge Pyes, punysshed shall be. Robert Vaghane to the Pye. Pyke the hence Pye, pyke the hence prater Pyke the hence peuysshe, pyke the pyed Pye walke in the wanyond, and wayte for some water To lyck at thy lyppes, that of lyinge are drye Thy braggynge bostes, once shalt thou dere bye Happe wyll so happen, I holde the a grote Than far from thy countrey, thou wylt be fayne to flye Or cowardly in couerte, go and chaunge thy cote. Lenuoy de Robert Vaghane. Moue nat thy mynde, with crewell malyce Agaynst thy detractours, O symple Innocence Remembre howe prycketh them, the synne of auaryce Gyuynge them boldenes, thou knowest by experyence Acquaynt the therfore, with pearles pacyence Requyre thou her, with the for to abyde Euer to stande, and be in thy defence Tyll suche a tyme, as thy trouth may be tryed. Vexe nat thy vaynes, with vyolent hate Expell from the, all enuye and yar Receyue no ranker, for hurtynge thyne estate Neuer from pacyence, flye thou for yar Onely she is thy remedye None other, but her knowe I Recure to be. Robert Vaghane to the treatyse. Go forth lytell treatyse, I do the c?myt To her womanly wysdom, that shall the retayne And thoughe thou be both lose and vnknyt I doubte nat, but she wyll do her busye payne To sowe the togyther, with fyne sylke of Spayne And make the an hyllynge, of fyne veluet blewe Because in the, is nothynge sayde certayne But she her selfe, doth knowe it to be trewe. Haue than no drede, to be in her protection As thou dost her, so wyll she the defende And for to say the soth, in myne election I can nat se, what nature more can lende To any wyght, her fourme to amende Her vertues vernysshe, as vyolettes in vere I wyll nat speake, other to offende But in wyt and womanheade, I knowe nat her pere. Therfore, whan thou shalt come to her syght whiche wyll be shortely, as far as I gesse Say thou arte sende, to pleade in her ryght As in the quarell, of thyne owne maystresse Than shall she se, what thou canst expresse For her defence, her ryght to recure And from detractours, that wolde the suppresse In her Cypresse cofer, she wyll kepe the sure.
