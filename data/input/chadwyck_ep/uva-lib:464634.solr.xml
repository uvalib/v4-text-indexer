SERENISSIMO POTENTISSIMOQVE PRINCIPI AC DOMINO NOSTRO IACOBO, DEI GRATIA Magnæ Britanniæ, Franciæ &amp; Hiberniæ REGI, Fidei defensori &amp;c. AUgustissime &amp; Potentissime Rex, A DEDICATORIE TO THEIR MOST MAGNIFICENT King, From the Lovers of learning. Who with sweet layes (O King) would please thyne eare, Or make thy glorie more by verse appeare, Hee with à Torch should seeme to cleare the day, And with à teare enlarge the groundlesse sea: For not inspyr'd by Phœbus men Thee deeme, But gold-wing'd Phœbus selfe they Thee esteeme, Nor did'st thou drink of Aganippe Well, But thou à Spring art where Joves daughters dwell, In which grave Pitho with each fair-hair'd Howre, And blew-ey'd Pallas all their Nectar powre: Yet thus much wee, the Muses nurslings, would, Though not as thou deserv'st, yet as wee could, In this glade tyme, when now, by thy Repaire To these deare bounds where first thou sucked aire, Joy over-joy'd in formes confus'd appeares, And maks old age amaz'd of Æsons yeeres, As was oure dewtie, humblie to Thee bring These lines, à gift but small for such à King, Save that wee know, what all the world doth know, That thou canst small things take, as great bestow; Which is the rarest, too and richest Gemme, That can adorne à Princes Diademe. Done out of the greeke. FORTH FEASTING. A PANEGYRICKE To the King. Flumina senserunt ipsa. To his sacred Majestie. If, in this Storme of joy and pompous Throng, This Nymphe (great King) come euer Thee so neare That Thy harmonious Eares Her Accents heare, Giue Pardon to Her hoarse and lowlie Song. Faine would Shee Trophees to Thy Vertues reare, But for this statlie Task Shee is not Strong, And Her Defects Her high Attempts doe wrong, Yet as Shee could shee makes Thy VVorth appeare. So in a Mappe is showen this flowrie Place; So wrought in Arras by a Virgines Hand With Heauen and blazing Starres doth Atlas stand, So drawen by Chare-coale is Narcissus Face: Shee maye Aurora be to some bright Sunne Which maye perfect the Day by Her begunne. What blustring Noise now interrupts my Sleepe? VVhat echoing Shouts thus cleaue my chrystal Deep? And call mee hence from out my watrie Court? VVhat Melodie, what Sounds of Joy and Sport, Bee these heere hurld from eu'rie neighbour Spring? VVith what lowd Rumours doe the Mountaines ring? VVhich in vnusuall Pompe on tip-toes stand, And (full of VVonder) ouer-looke the Land? VVhence come these glittring Throngs, these Meteors bright, This golden People set vnto my Sight? VVhence doth this Praise, Applause, and Loue, arise? VVhat Load-starre east-ward draweth thus all Eyes? Am J awake? or haue some Dreames conspir'd To mocke my Sense with Shadowes much desir'd? Stare J that liuing Face, see J those Lookes, VVhich with Delight wont to amaze my Brookes? Doe J behold that VVorth, that Man divine, This Ages Glorie, by these Bankes of mine? Then is it true what long J wish'd in vaine? That my much-louing Prince is come againe? So vnto Them whose Zenith is the Pole, VVhen sixe blacke Months are past, the Sunne doeth rolle: So after Tempest to Sea-tossed VVights Faire Helens Brothers show their chearing Lights: So comes Arabias Meruaile from her VVoods, And farre farre off is seene by Memphis Floods, The feather'd Syluans Clowd-like by her flie, And with applauding Clangors beate the Skie, Nyle wonders, Seraps Priests (entranced) raue, And in Mygdonian Stone her Shape ingraue; In lasting Cedars marke the joyfull Time In which Apollos Bird came to their Clime. Let Mother Earth now deckt with Flowres bee seene, And sweet-breath'd Zephyres curle the Medowes greene: Let Heauens weepe Rubies in a crimsin Showre, Such as on Indies Shores they vse to powre: Or with that golden Storme the Fields adorne, Which Ioue rain'd, when his Blew-eyed Maide was borne. May neuer Houres the Webbe of Day out-weaue, May neuer Night rise from her sable Caue. Swell prowd my Billowes, faint not to declare Your Joyes, as ample as their Causes are: For Murmures hoarse sound like Arions Harpe, Now delicatlie flat, now sweetlie sharpe. And you my Nymphes, rise from your moyst Repaire, Strow all your Springs and Grotts with Lillies faire: Some swiftest-footted get her hence and pray Our Floods and Lakes, come keepe this Holie-day; What e're beneath Albanias Hills doe runne, Which see the rising or the setting Sunne, Which drinke sterne Grampius Mists, or Ochells Snows: Stone-rowling Taye, Tine Tortoyse-like that flows, The pearlie Don, the Deas, the fertile Spay, Wild Neverne which doth see our longest Day, Nesse smoaking-Sulphure, Leaue with Mountaines crown'd, Strange Loumond for his floting Isles renown'd: The irish Rian, Ken, the silver Aire, The snakie Dun, the Ore with rushie Haire, The Chrystall-streaming Nid, lowd-bellowing Clyd, Tweed which no more our Kingdomes shall deuide: Rancke-swelling Annan, Lid with curled Streames, The Eskes, the Solway where they loose their Names, To eu'rie one proclaime our Joyes, and Feasts, Our Triumphes; bid all come, and bee our Guests: And as they meet in Neptunes azure Hall, Bid Them bid Sea-Gods keepe this Festiuall. This Day shall by our Currents bee renown'd, Our Hills about shall still this Day resound: Nay, that our Loue more to this Day appeare, Let vs with it hence foorh begin our Yeare. To Virgins Flowres, to Sunne-burnt Earth the Raine, To Mariners faire Winds amidst the Maine: Coole Shades to Pilgrimes, which hote Glances burne, Please not so much, to vs as Thy Returne. That Day (deare Prince) which rest vs of thy Sight, [Day, no, but Darknesse, and a duskie Night] Did fraight our Brests with Sighs, our Eyes with Teares, Turn'd Minutes in sad Months, sad Months in Yeares: Trees left to flowrish, Medowes to beare Flowres, Brookes hid their Heads within their sedgie Bowres, Faire Ceres curst our Fields with barren Frost, As if againe shee had her Daughter lost: The Muses left our Groues, and for sweete Songs Sate sadlie silent, or did weepe their Wrongs; Yee know it Meads, yee murmuring Woods it know, Hilles, Dales, and Caues, Copartners of their Woe; And yee it know my Streames, which from their Eine Oft on your Glasse receiu'd their pearled Brine; O Naïds deare (said They) Nap?as faire, O Nymphes of Trees, Nymphes which on Hills repaire, Gone are those maiden Glories, gone that State, Which made all Eyes admire our Hap of late. As lookes the Heauen when neuer Starre appeares, But slow and wearie shroude them in their Spheares, VVhile Tithons wife embosom'd by Him lies, And World doth languish in a drearie Guise: As lookes a Garden of its Beautie spoil'd, As Wood in Winter by rough Boreas foil'd; As Pourtraicts raz'd of Colours vse to bee: So lookt these abject Bounds depriu'd of Thee. VVhile as my Rills enjoy'd Thy royall Gleames, They did not envie Tibers haughtie Streames, Nor wealthie Tagus with his golden Ore, Nor cleare Hydaspes which on Pearles doth rore, Empampred Gange that sees the Sunne new borne, Nor Acheloüs with his flowrie Horne, Nor Floods which neare Elysian Fields doe fall: For why? Thy Sight did serue to them for all. No Place there is so desart, so alone, Euen from the frozen to the torrid Zone, From flaming Hecla to great Quincys Lake, Which Thine abode could not most happie make. All those Perfections which by bounteous Heauen To diuerse Worlds in diuerse Times were giuen, The starrie Senate powr'd at once on Thee, That Thou Examplare mightst to Others bee. Thy Life was kept till the three Sisters spunne Their Threedes of Gold, and then it was begunne. With curled Clowds when Skies doe looke most faire, And no disordred Blasts disturbe the Aire, When Lillies doe them decke in azure Gownes; And new-borne Roses blush with golden Crownes; To bode, how calme wee vnder Thee should liue, What Halcyonean Dayes Thy Reigne should giue, And to two flowrie Diademes Thy right; The Heauens Thee made a Partner of the Light. Scarce wast Thou borne, when joyn'd in friendly Bands Two mortall Foes with other clasped Hands, With Vertue Fortune stroue, which most should grace Thy Place for Thee, Thee for so high a Place, One vow'd thy sacred Brest not to forsake, The Other on Thee not to turne her Backe, And that Thou more her loues Effects mightst feele For Thee shee rent her Sayle, and broke her Wheele. When Yeeres Thee vigour gaue, O then how cleare Did smoothred Sparkles in bright Flames appeare? Amongst the Woods to force a flying Hart, To pearce the mountaine-Wolfe with feathred Dart, See Faulcons climbe the Clowds, the Foxe ensnare, Out-runne the winde-out-running dædale Hare, To loose a trampling Steede alongst a Plaine, And in meandring Gyres him bring againe, The Preasse Thee making place, were vulgare Things; In Admirations Aire on Glories Wings O! Thou farre from the common Pitch didst rise, With Thy designes to dazell Enuies Eyes: Thou soughtst to know, this Alls eternall Source, Of euer-turning Heauens the restlesse Course, Their fixed Fyes, their Lights which wandring runne, Whence Moone her Siluer hath, his Gold the Sunne, If Destine bee or no, if Planets can By fierce Aspects force the Free-will of Man: The light and spiring Fire, the liquid Aire, The flaming Dragons, Comets with red Haire, Heauens tilting Launces, Artillerie, and Bow, Lowd-sounding Trumpets, Darts of Haile and Snow, The roaring Element with People dombe, The Earth with what conceiu'd is in her Wombe, VVhat on Her moues, were set vnto Thy Sight, Till Thou didst find their Causes, Essence, Might: But vnto nought Thou so Thy Mind didst straine As to bee read in Man, and learne to raigne; To know the VVeight, and Atlas of a Crowne, To spare the Humble, Prowdlings pester downe. VVhen from those pearcing Cares which Thrones invest, As Thornes the Rose, Thou weari'd wouldst Thee rest, VVith Lute in Hand, full of cœlestiall Fire, To the Pierian Groues Thou didst retire: There, garlanded with all Uranias Flowres, In sweeter Layes than builded Thebees Towres, Or them which charm'd the Dolphines in the Maine, Or which did call Euridicè againe, Thou sungst away the Houres, till from their Spheare Starres seem'd to shoote, Thy Melodie to heare. The God with golden Haire, the Sister Maides, Left, nymphall Helicon, their Tempès Shades, To see Thine Jsle, heere lost their natiue Tongue, And in Thy world-divided Language sung. Who of Thine After-age can count the Deedes, With all that Fame in Times hudge Annales reedes, How by Example more than anie Law, This People fierce Thou didst to Goodnesse draw; How while the Neighbour Worlds (tows'd by the Fates) So manie Phaëtons had in their States, Which turn'd in heedlesse Flames their burnish'd Thrones, Thou (as ensphear'd) kepdst temperate Thy Zones; In Africke Shores the Sands that ebbe and flow, The shadie Leaues on Ardennes Trees that grow, Hee sure may count, with all the Waues that meet To wash the Mauritanian Atlas feet. Though crown'd thou wert not, nor a King by Birth, Thy Worth deserues the richest Crowne on Earth. Search this Halfe Spheare and the opposite Ground, Where is such Wit and Bountie to bee found? As into silent Night, when neare the Beare The Virgine Huntresse shines at full most cleare, And striues to match her Brothers golden Light, The Hoast of Starres doth vanish in her Sght, Arcturus dies, cool'd is the Lyons ire, Po burnes no more with Phaëtontall Fire, Orion faints to see his Armes grow blacke, And that his flamming Sword hee now doth lacke: So Europes Lights, all bright in their Degree, Loose all their Lustre paragond with Thee. By just Discent Thou from moe Kings dost shine, Then manie can name Men in all their Line: What most They toyle to find, and finding hold Thou skornest, orient Gemmes, and flattring Gold: Esteeming Treasure surer in Mens Brests, Than when immur'd with Marble, closd in Chests; No stormie Passions doe disturbe thy Mind, No Mists of greatnesse euer could Thee blind: Who yet hath beene so meeke? Thou life didst giue To Them who did repine to see Thee liue; What Prince by Goodnesse hath such Kingdomes gain'd? Who hath so long his Peoples Peace maintain'd? Their Swords are turn'd in Sythes, in Culters Speares, Some giant Post their anticke Armour beares: Now, where the wounded Knight his Life did bleed, The wanton Swaine sits piping on a Reed. And where the Canon did Joves Thunder skorne, The gawdie Hunts-man windes his shrill-tun'd Horne: Her greene Lockes Ceres void of feare doth die, The Pilgrime safelie in the Shade doth lie, Both Pan and Pales (carelesse) keepe their Flockes, Seas haue no Dangers saue the Winds and Rockes: Thou art this Jsles Palladium, neither can [While Thou art kept] it bee o're-throwne by Man. Let Others boast of Blood and Spoyles of Foes, Fierce Rapines, Murders, Iliads of Woes, Of hated Pompe, and Trophæes reared faire, Gore-spangled Ensignes streaming in the Aire, Count how They make The Scythian them adore, The Gaditan the Souldiour of Aurore, Vnhappie Vauntrie! to enlarge their Bounds, VVhich charge themselues with Cares, their Friends with Wounds, Which haue no Law to their ambitious Will, But (Man-plagues) borne are humane Blood to spill: Thou a true Victor art, sent from aboue What Others straine by Force to gaine by Loue, World-wandring Fame this Prayse to Thee imparts, To bee the onlie Monarch of all Hearts. They many feare who are of many fear'd, And Kingdomes got by Wrongs by Wrongs are tear'd, Such Thrones as Blood doth raise Blood throweth downe, No Guard so sure as Loue vnto a Crowne. Fye of our westerne World, Mars-daunting King, With whose Renowne the Earths seuen Climats ring, Thy Deedes not only claime these Diademes, To which Thame, Liffy, Taye, subject their Streames: But to Thy Vertues rare, and Gifts, is due All that the Planet of the Yeere doth view; Sure if the World aboue did want a Prince, The World aboue to it would take thee hence. That Murder, Rapine, Lust, are fled to Hell, And in their Roomes with vs the Graces dwell, That Honour more than Riches Men respect, That Worthinesse than Gold doth more effect, That Pietie vnmasked showes her Face, That Innocencie keepes with Power her Place, That long-exil'd Astrea leaues the Heauen, And turneth right her Sword, her Weights holds euen, That the Saturnian World is come againe, Are wish'd Effects of Thy most happie Raigne. That dayly Peace, Loue, Trueth, Delights encrease, And Discord, Hate, Fraude, with Jncombers cease, That Men vse Strength not to shed others Blood, But vse their Strength now to doe other Good, That Furie is enchain'd, disarmed Wrath, That (saue by Natures Hand) there is no Death, That late grimme Foes like Brothers other loue, That Vultures prey not on the harmlesse Doue, That Wolues with Lambs doe Friendship entertaine, Are wish'd Effects of thy most happie Raigne. That Towns encrease, That ruin d Temples rise, And their wind-mouing Vanes plant in the Skies, That Ignorance and Sloth hence runne away, That buri'd Arts now rowse them to the Day, That Hyperiòn farre beyond his Bed Doth see, our Lyons rampe, our Roses spred, That Iber courtes vs, Tyber not vs charmes; That Rhein with hence-brought Beams his Bosome warmes, That Euill vs feare, and Good vs doe maintaine, Are wish'd Effects of Thy most happie Raigne. O Vertues Patterne, Glorie of our Times, Sent of past Dayes to expiate the Crimes, Great King, but better farre than thou art greate, Whome State not honours, but who honours State, By Wonder borne, by Wonder first install'd, By Wonder after to new Kingdomes call'd, Young kept by Wonder neare home-bred Alarmes, Old sau'd by Wonder from pale Traitours Harmes, To bee for this Thy Raigne which Wonders brings, A King of Wonder, Wonder vnto Kings. If Pict, Dane, Norman, Thy smooth Yoke had seene, Pict, Dane, and Norman had thy Subjects beene: If Brutus knew the Blisse Thy Rule doth giue, Euen Brutus joye would vnder Thee to liue: For Thou Thy People dost so dearlie loue, That they a Father, more than Prince, Thee proue. O Dayes to bee desyr'd! Age happie thrice! If yee your Heauen-sent-Good could duelie prize, But yee (halfe-palsie-sicke) thinke neuer right Of what yee hold, till it bee from your Sight, Prize onlie Summers sweet and musked Breath, When armed Winters threaten you with Death, In pallid Sicknesse doe esteeme of Health, And by sad Pouertie discerne of Wealth: J see ane Age when after manie Yeares, And Reuolutions of the slow-pac'd Spheares, These Dayes shall bee to other farre esteem'd, And like Augustus palmie Raigne bee deem'd. The Names of Arthur, fabulous Palladines, Grau'n in Times surlie Brows in wrincked Lines, Of Henries, Edwards, famous for their Fights, Their Neighbour Conquests, Orders new of Knights, Shall by this Princes Name be past as farre As Meteors are by the Idalian Starre. If Gray-hair'd Proteüs Songs the Truth not misse, And Gray-hair'd Proteüs oft a Prophet is, There is a Land hence-distant manie Miles, Out-reaching Fiction and Atlanticke Iles, Which (Homelings) from this litle World wee name, That shall imblazon with strange Rites his Fame, Shall reare him Statues all of purest Gold, Such as Men gaue vnto the Gods of old, Name by him Fanes, prowd Pallaces, and Towns, With some great Flood, which most their Fields renowns. This is that King who should make right each Wrong, Of whome the Bards and mysticke Sybilles song, The Man long promis'd, by whose glorious Raigne, This Isle should yet her ancient Name regaine, And more of Fortunate deserue the Stile, Than those where Heauens with double Summers smile. Runne on (great Prince) Thy Course in Glories Way, The End the Life, the Euening crownes the Day; Heape Worth on Worth, and stronglie soare aboue Those Heights which made the World Thee first to loue, Surmount Thy Selfe, and make thine Actions past Bee but as Gleames or Lightnings of Thy last, Let them exceed them of Thy younger Time, As farre as Autumne doth the flowrie Prime. Through this Thy Empire range, like Worlds bright Eye, That once each Yeare survayes all Earth and Skie, Now glaunces on the slow and restie Beares, Then turnes to drie the weeping Austers Teares, Just vnto both the Poles, and moueth euen In the infigur'd Circle of the Heauen. O long long haunt these Bounds, which by Thy Sight Haue now regain'd their former Heate and Light. Heere grow greene Woods, heere siluer Brookes doe glide, Heere Meadowes stretch them out with painted Pride, Embrodring all the Banks, heere Hilles aspire To crowne their Heads with the ætheriall Fire: Hills, Bullwarks of our Freedome, giant Walls, Which neuer Fremdlings Slight nor Sword made Thralls; Each circling Flood to Thetis Tribute payes, Men heere (in Health) out-liue old Nestors Dayes: Grimme Saturne yet amongst our Rocks remaines, Bound in our Caues, with many Mettald Chaines: Bulls haunt our Shades like Ledas Louer white, Which yet might breede Pasiphaè Delight, Our Flocks faire Fleeces beare, with which for Sport Endemion of old the Moone did court, High-palmed Harts amidst our Forrests runne, And, not impall'd, the deepe-mouth'd Hounds doe shunne; The rough-foote Hare him in our Bushes shrowds, And long-wing'd Haulks doe pearch amidst our Clowds. The wanton wood-Nymphes of the verdant Spring, Blew, Golden, Purple, Flowres shall to Thee bring, Pomonas Fruits the Paniskes, Thetis Gyrles Thy Thulys Amber, with the Ocean Pearles; The Tritons, Heards-men of the glassie Field, Shall giue Thee what farre-distant Shores can yeeld, The Serean Fleeces, Erythrean Gemmes, Vaste Platas Siluer, Gold of Peru Streames, Antarticke Parrots, A Ethiopian Plumes, Sabæan Odours, Myrrhe, and sweet Perfumes: And I my selfe, wrapt in a watchet Gowne, Of Reedes and Lillies on mine Head a Crowne, Shall Incense to Thee burne, greene Altars raise, And yearly-sing due Pæans to Thy Praise. Ah why should Isis only see Thee shine? Js not thy Forth, as well as Isis Thine? Though Isis vaunt shee hath more Wealth in store, Let it suffice Thy Forth doth loue Thee more: Though Shee for Beautie may compare with Seine, For Swannes and Sea-Nymphes with imperiall Rhene, Yet in the Title may bee claim'd in Thee, Nor Shee, nor all the VVorld, can match with mee. Now when (by Honour drawne) thou shalt away To Her alreadie jelous of thy Stay, When in Her amourous Armes Shee doth Thee fold, And dries Thy Dewie Haires with Hers of Gold, Much questioning of Thy Fare, much of Thy Sport, Much of Thine Absence, Long, how e're so short, And chides (perhaps) Thy Comming to the North, Loathe not to thinke on Thy much-louing Forth: O loue these Bounds, where of Thy royall Stemme More then an hundreth wore a Diademe. So euer Gold and Bayes Thy Browes adorne, So neuer Time may see thy Race out-worne, So of Thine Owne still mayst Thou bee desir'd, Of Strangers fear'd, redoubted, and admir'd; So Memorie the Praise, so precious Houres May character Thy Name in starrie Flowres; So may Thy high Exployts at last make euen, With Earth thy Empyre, Glorie with the Heauen. This Poême was presented by William Drummond of Hawthorne-denne. THE KINGS MAIESTIE CAME TO KINAIRD ON THURISDAY THE XXII OF MAY [Great Man of God, whom God doeth call, and choose] This subsequent welcome was also presented to his M. at Kinaird. Great Man of God, whom God doeth call, and choose On Earth his great Lieutenents place to use, Wee blesse the tyme, wherin the threefold Croun And Diademe with peace, and great renoun In that so long fore-told, and fatal cheare Thou on thy braue, and royall brow didst beare: As from that tym thy absence bred our bane, Thy presence now restores our Joy's againe: Thou went away to Scotlands deip displeasure But thy return brings mirth beyond all measure. Astræa doth pronunce by thy sueit tong What shuld of right to Kings on earth belong: Thy myld aspect doeth realmes and cities nurish, And as thou frouns or faun's they fall &amp; floorish: These suords the sherp, and bloodie tools of warr, Which peace hath sheath'd in rust, shall from a farr, Bee drawn agane, and when thou thinks it good Thy angrie brow shall bath the world in blood, Thou canst Dethrone, and giue the royall wreathe And hyd thy suord, and hold it in the sheath. Yet now thou deign's to visit our cold North, And with thy Court hast crost the sinuose Forth, Which with Meanders winding heer and there Great Britans King upon her back did beare, Whois bouldin billoes (as they did of yore) Shall set thee sure upon there yonder shore. And statelie Tay with stryving streams which marches And skorns his course shuld be controld with Arches, Who with his speats in spightfull raige hath dround The famose Perths faire Bridge, &amp; broght to gro?d, Shall straine the strenght of his strong streams thow'll see, And be at peace with all the world for thee. THOW shall not loose thy labors, nor thy loue, Which in a Prince most rare, most rare dooth proue: This bontie singular, which thou imparts, Encounters not with mis-conceiving hearts Nor with ingratefull subjects, for each One Aknowledgeth the good which thou hast done: Man neuer was more loved by ane other, Not David by kynd Jonathan his brother As thou by vs, thou dwels in each mans heart, Our Joy, and our felicitie thou art: O had our breists of stuff transparent bene, That all our thoughts might so to thee be sene, Thy Scotland do'th (thy royall grace wold tell) For Courage, Truth, and Loue, the World excell: And wee confesse, our Joyes are perfect now, Iff they could proue perpetuall, heauens allow A longer stay then thou intends, that so Our loue-seik hopes might to the full tyd flo. To toyll and travell man is borne wee see, As sparks of fire by nature upward flie, Thy travell yet shalbe compenst with pleasure Thou shalt haue sports, and pairt of all our treasure: Wee'll keep that custome with thy sacred grace Which Athenæus writes was keept in Thrace, ‘The subjects gaue their King when euer hee wanted, ‘When they wax'd poore, their suit's by him wer granted: Thus each in loue supplied an others neid, Both peace, and wealth, this kynd c?merce did breid. And Persians when they did pr?sent their King, Some rare propyne they alwayes vs'd to bring. But put the case, this forme which Persians used Wer by some base and wretched wormes refused, Thy faithfull Quæstors, full of loue and paine, (Whois betters haue not bene, whois lyk againe Thou canst not find) shall such aboundance bring, As King nor Court shall want no kynd of thing: Not lyk those lowns, whom Athens old did trust, They wer but Theiv's vnhonest, and injust. These Tamij the treasure stole by night, And then they burnd the Citadel by flight, That by this fire their fraud shuld not be seene, Nor they accus'd, that had so knavish beene: Thy Quæstors here are honest, wyse, and true; Thy treasure saiff, thy Bastils bvilt of new: Stay then (dread Leige) O stay with ws a while With pleasing sports the posting tyme begyle: Thy fynest Hawks and fleitest Hounds shall find Of fowls and beasts, a pray of euerie kynd. For morning both and euenyng flight, each day Each Hawk thou hast, shall haue her proper pray; Each fowl that flies shall meit thee in thy way, And in their sorts shall Ave Cæsar say. Throgh forests, Parks, and feilds hunt stag, &amp; Haire It helps the health to haue the natiue air. Hee that taks pains and travell sleepeth best, With greidines hee taks refreshing rest, His meate to him seems savorie, sweet, and fyne, Hee glaidlie drinks the heart-comforting wyne: Good blood, quick spirits, travell sweet do'th cherish And maks offensiue humors for to perish. And wyse-men write that Colik, Gout, and Gravel, The woefull fruits of rest, ar cur'd by travel: Let not thy horses fatt, for standing Idle, They'll grow stiff neck'd, and disobey the brydle. Let faithfull Turbo menage thy affaires And kill himselfe with care, to ease thy caires. Thou shalt not trauel, throgh hott barren bounds Of Arabie, nor cold, and snowie sounds Of Norwa, nor the Schythian savage montans, Nor fenni Flanders skant of healthfull fontans, Nor throgh thy France so full of fearfull Jarrs, Where King and subjects waige intestine warrs, But throgh Braue Britan of all realms the best, With pleasours all, with peace, and plentie blest, Which God sejoyns from all the world (wee see) That none but Neptune shuld thy neighbour bee. Let not Our Loue infer the least offence, Thou art our Lord our kyndlie King, our Prence: Our int'rest so is such (Dread Leige) in thee Thogh Earths great Glob wer thyne, ours thou must bee, From Jacob learne to loue Canaan best, The native soill: for when his sonnes wer blest, Hee charged them to take him heame againe, Him to interre in Ephrons flowrie plaine: Abraam there, and Sara sleep, said hee, There Jsaak, and Rebecca both doe lye, And there I buried Lea: Joseph weiped, In Ephron Jacob with his fathers sleiped: Joseph waxd chief in Pharaos court, and yet Knowing the Tribs wold out of Egipt flitt, Hee took his brethren, and the people sworne His bones from thence shuld be to Ephron borne, To keip their oath his brethren, and the rest Imbalmed him and put him in a chest, And when they fled from Egypt (as they sweare) Moyses with him good Josephs bones did beare: Liue Nestors dayes King James but liue among vs By blood and birth thou do'st alone belong vs, Stay then at home, to Thames make no returne, Sleip with thy fathers in thy fathers vrn. But wee'r too bold to beg thy longer stay, Since God sets doun thy Jests, and gyds thy way, From death in famine God deliuereth thee, From sword in battell thou shall still be frie, Destruction thou shall skorne, and laugh at dearth, And shall not feare the cruell beasts on earth, Ston's of the feild shall be in league with thee, And beasts at peace with great King James shall be, Yea thou shall know peace dwells thy tents within, In spight of Babell and that Man of sin: To thy great Joy ô King thou shall perceaue, Thy seed as grasse on earth: Thou shall to graue In fullest aige (like to a rig of Corne Broght to the Barne in season due) be borne. And if the Lord hes said that thou must leaue vs, If England must of this our Joy bereaue vs, If thou wilt go, and leaue vs full of sorrow, This prayer short from Paynim pen wee borrow. Our sacred King, wyse James the Lord defend, And royall seed, till all this All tak end, Heavens grant to him, his faire and verteous wyfe In peace and plentie, long and happie lyfe. Lord blesse, preserue, and keep him frie from ill, Of happie Kings let him be happiest still: And, whilst he lives, let him not see, nor heare, The death of one, that to his Grace seems deare, Let his Dominions farr, and long perseuer, And (still adornd with Justice) last for euer: Tyme stay thy hast, relent thy former furie, And let King James our childrens children burie. O touch him not proud Fortune but in kyndnes, Or if thou do'st, hee still defyes thy blindnes: Heavens grant this Ile, with toyls tormoyled long May be his meanes, be cur'd from sin and wrong: GOD grant hee saue Religion from decay, And reestablish such as runne astray: Lord let this Starr in brightnes still abound, To light the World so long in Darknes dround: And let each true, and faithfull subject sing With heart and woyce conjoynd, God saue the King. Alexander Craig Of Rose-craig. [O Royal Phœbus keepe this course for ever]The attribution of this poem is questionable. THE KINGS MAIESTIE CAME TO PAISLEY THE XXIIII OF JULY Where in the Earle of Abercorne his great Hall was verie gratiouslie deliuered by a prettie boy of 9 yeeres age Williame Semple sone to Sir James Semple of Beltrics this Welcome following. O Royal Phœbus keepe this course for ever, And from thy deare Britannia never sever, But if the Fates will rather frame it so That Phœbus now must come, and then must goe, Long may thy selfe; Thy race mot ever ring Thus, without end: vvee end. God Save our KING. Amen. [Burst furth, my Muse, too long thou holds thy peace] THE KINGS MAIESTIE CAME to Hamilton on Moonday the xxviii of Iuly. Burst furth, my Muse, too long thou holds thy peace, Paint furth the passions of thy new-borne joy: Forbear to sing thy lovelie layes a space; Leave wanton Venus, and her blinded boy. Raise vp thy voice, and now, deare Muse, proclaime A greater subject, and a graver theame. Since our much lov'd Apollo doth appeare In pompe and pow'r, busked with golden rayes, More brigt heir shyning on our hemispheare, Nor that great planet father of the dayes; With boldnes offer at his sacred shryne These firstlings of thy weake and poore ingyne. Great Iames, whose hand a thre-fold scepter swayes By heavens exalted to so high à place, Both crown'd with gold, and never fading bayes Who keps three kingdoms in so still à peace, Whose love, cair, wisdome, grace, &amp; high deserts, Have maid thee Monarch of thy subjects harts. Thogh thou by armes great empyrs may'st surprise, Mak Europ thrall, and over Asia reigne, Yet at thy feet despysed, Bellona lyes: No crownes thou craves which bloodie conqueis staine. Whill others aime at greatnes boght with blood, Not to bee great thou stryves, bot to bee good. Whome snakie hatred, soule conceav'd disdaine, Hart-rooted rancor, envy borne in hell Did long in long antipathie detaine To eithers ruine, as they both can tell, Uniting them thou hast enlarged thy throne, And maid devyded Albion All Bee one. O heavenlie vnion! O thryse happie change From bloodie broyles, from battells and debait, From mischeifs, cruelties, and sad revenge To love and peace, thou hes transformd our stait, Which now confirmed, by thee before begunne Shall last till earth is circuit with the Sunne. Jov's great vice-gerent, Neptuns richest treasure, Earths glorie, Europs wonder, Britanns pryde, Thy wit (lyk heaven) in such a divyne measure This litle world so happilie doth guyd; That Cæsar, Trajan, Pompey, Alexander, If now they liv'd, the place to thee might rander. What wants in the (O King) heavens could impairt? Or what is in thee not of highest pryce? A liberall hand, a most magnifick hart, A readie judgment, and a prompt advyse, A mynd onconquered fearcest foes to thrall, Bright eye of knowledge: singular in all. Thy waitchfull caire, thy zeale and fervent love, The Church, the laye, each high or low estaite Long-since by many worthie deeds did prove; Bot most of all by these effects of laite. For thou affects amongst thy high design's To build the Sanctuarie of the King of Kings. Heavens therefore did thy royall grandeur guaird; Thy Royall person from the cradle keap'd From thousand plots t'eclips thy Sunne prepair'd By these who horror vpon horror heap'd Their barbarous hands into thy blood to bathe, And mak thee (guiltles) object of their wrathe. Thogh Anaks cursed children did repyne; Yet heavens made Josua over them prevaill: Thogh hellish harts envyd'd thy glories shyne; Yet in the practise their attempts did faill. But loe, thy mercie still to be admir'd! Thou spared them, against thee who conspyr'd. For as in all thou second art to none, To thee all Kings in clemencie give place. Thryce happie people rul'd by such a one, Whose lyfe both this and after-tymes shall grace: Long may thy subjects, ere thy glasse outrunne, Enjoy the light of thee their glorious Sunne. What Load-stone strange had such attractive force To draw thee home-ward to these northerne parts? Whill Mars the world affrights with trumpets hoarse, Broyls inhumaine devyding humane harts; Whill Belgium braine-sick is, France mother-sick, And with Iberian fyres the Alpes doe reik. Most lyk that fishe, whose golden shape of late Was to thee given, thy love to represent, Which in the Ocean thogh shee doe grow great And many foraine floods, and shelves frequ?t; Yet not vnmyndfull of her native Burnes, Thogh with great toyle, vnto them back returnes. Rejoyce then, Scotland; change thy mourning weed; Now deck thy selfe into thy best attyre: And lyk a bryd advance thy chearfull head; Enjoy with surfet now thy soules desyre; Uncessantlie with sighs importune heaven That thou may long enjoy this gift new given. Welcome, O welcome thryse, our glorious guyd; A thousand tymes this soyle doth thee salute, Welcome, O welcome, Britanns greatest pryd, By thee which happie doth it selfe repute. Thogh all-where welcome; yet most welcome heir: Long haunt thir bounds, ere thou from hence retire. Heir plesant plain's alongst the crystall Clyd, Which in a flowrie labyrinth her playes, Heir blooming banks, heir silver brooks doe slyd, Heir Mearle, and Maves sing melodious layes, Heir heards of Deer defy the fleetest Hounds; Heir wods and vail's, and Echoes that resounds. Stay then, O stay, and with thy presence grace That noble race, which famous by thy blood, Long toyle and trouble glaidlie did embrace, And wounded oft gusht furth à crimson flood, In hazards great defending with renowne The liberties, and glorie of thy Crowne. But leaving more to entertaine thyn ear's With airie accents, hoarse and homelie songs, My solitarie Muse her selfe reteirs Un-usd abroad to haunt such pompous throngs. Sua renders place that after emptie words, Thou may partack such as this soyle affords. S? William Mure younger, of Rowallan.</field>
