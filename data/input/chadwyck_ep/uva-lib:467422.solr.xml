Faith and Despondency ‘The winter wind is loud and wild, Come close to me, my darling child; Forsake thy books, and mateless play; And, while the night is gathering grey, We'll talk its pensive hours away;— ‘Iernë, round our sheltered hall November's gusts unheeded call; Not one faint breath can enter here Enough to wave my daughter's hair, And I am glad to watch the blaze Glance from her eyes, with mimic rays; To feel her cheek so softly pressed, In happy quiet on my breast. ‘But, yet, even this tranquillity Brings bitter, restless thoughts to me; And, in the red fire's cheerful glow, I think of deep glens, blocked with snow; I dream of moor, and misty hill, Where evening closes dark and chill; For, lone, among the mountains cold, Lie those that I have loved of old. And my heart aches, in hopeless pain Exhausted with repinings vain, That I shall greet them ne'er again!’ ‘Father, in early infancy, When you were far beyond the sea, Such thoughts were tyrants over me! I often sat, for hours together, Through the long nights of angry weather, Raised on my pillow, to descry The dim moon struggling in the sky; Or, with strained ear, to catch the shock, Of rock with wave, and wave with rock; So would I fearful vigil keep, And, all for listening, never sleep. But this world's life has much to dread, Not so, my Father, with the dead. ‘Oh! not for them, should we despair, The grave is drear, but they are not there; Their dust is mingled with the sod, Their happy souls are gone to God! You told me this, and yet you sigh, And murmur that your friends must die. Ah! my dear father, tell me why? For, if your former words were true, How useless would such sorrow be; As wise, to mourn the seed which grew Unnoticed on its parent tree, Because it fell in fertile earth, And sprang up to a glorious birth— Struck deep its root, and lifted high Its green boughs, in the breezy sky. ‘But, I'll not fear, I will not weep For those whose bodies rest in sleep,— I know there is a blessed shore, Opening its ports for me, and mine; And, gazing Time's wide waters o'er, I weary for that land divine, Where we were born, where you and I Shall meet our Dearest, when we die; From suffering and corruption free, Restored into the Deity.’ ‘Well hast thou spoken, sweet, trustful child! And wiser than thy sire; And worldly tempests, raging wild, Shall strengthen thy desire— Thy fervent hope, through storm and foam, Through wind and ocean's roar, To reach, at last, the eternal home, The steadfast, changeless, shore!’ ii. Stars Ah! why, because the dazzling sun Restored our Earth to joy, Have you departed, every one, And left a desert sky? All through the night, your glorious eyes Were gazing down in mine, And with a full heart's thankful sighs, I blessed that watch divine. I was at peace, and drank your beams As they were life to me; And revelled in my changeful dreams, Like petrel on the sea. Thought followed thought, star followed star, Through boundless regions, on; While one sweet influence, near and far, Thrilled through, and proved us one! Why did the morning dawn to break So great, so pure, a spell; And scorch with fire, the tranquil cheek, Where your cool radiance fell? Blood-red, he rose, and arrow-straight, His fierce beams struck my brow; The soul of nature, sprang, elate, But mine sank sad and low! My lids closed down, yet through their veil, I saw him, blazing, still, And steep in gold the misty dale, And flash upon the hill. I turned me to the pillow, then, To call back night, and see Your worlds of solemn light, again, Throb with my heart, and me! It would not do—the pillow glowed, And glowed both roof and floor; And birds sang loudly in the wood, And fresh winds shook the door; The curtains waved, the wakened flies Were murmuring round my room, Imprisoned there, till I should rise, And give them leave to roam. Oh, stars, and dreams, and gentle night; Oh, night and stars return! And hide me from the hostile light, That does not warm, but burn; That drains the blood of suffering men; Drinks tears, instead of dew; Let me sleep through his blinding reign, And only wake with you! iii. The Philosopher ‘Enough of thought, philosopher! Too long hast thou been dreaming Unenlightened, in this chamber drear, While summer's sun is beaming! Space-sweeping soul, what sad refrain Concludes thy musings once again? ‘“Oh, for the time when I shall sleep Without identity, And never care how rain may steep, Or snow may cover me! No promised heaven, these wild desires, Could all, or half fulfil; No threatened hell, with quenchless fires, Subdue this quenchless will!”’ ‘So said I, and still say the same; Still, to my death, will say— Three gods, within this little frame, Are warring night and day; Heaven could not hold them all, and yet They all are held in me; And must be mine till I forget My present entity! Oh, for the time, when in my breast Their struggles will be o'er! Oh, for the day, when I shall rest, And never suffer more!’ ‘I saw a spirit, standing, man, Where thou doth stand—an hour ago, And round his feet three rivers ran, Of equal depth, and equal flow— A golden stream—and one like blood; And one like sapphire seemed to be; But, where they joined their triple flood It tumbled in an inky sea. The spirit sent his dazzling gaze Down through that ocean's gloomy night Then, kindling all, with sudden blaze, The glad deep sparkled wide and bright— White as the sun, far, far more fair Than its divided sources were!’ ‘And even for that spirit, seer, I've watched and sought my life-time long; Sought him in heaven, hell, earth, and air— An endless search, and always wrong! Had I but seen his glorious eye Once light the clouds that wilder me, I ne'er had raised this coward cry To cease to think, and cease to be; I ne'er had called oblivion blest, Nor, stretching eager hands to death, Implored to change for senseless rest This sentient soul, this living breath— Oh, let me die—that power and will Their cruel strife may close; And conquered good, and conquering ill Be lost in one repose!’ iv. Remembrance Cold in the earth—and the deep snow piled above thee, Far, far, removed, cold in the dreary grave! Have I forgot, my only Love, to love thee, Severed at last by Time's all-severing wave? Now, when alone, do my thoughts no longer hover Over the mountains, on that northern shore, Resting their wings where heath and fern-leaves cover Thy noble heart for ever, ever more? Cold in the earth—and fifteen wild Decembers, From those brown hills, have melted into spring: Faithful, indeed, is the spirit that remembers After such years of change and suffering! Sweet Love of youth, forgive, if I forget thee, While the world's tide is bearing me along; Other desires and other hopes beset me, Hopes which obscure, but cannot do thee wrong! No later light has lightened up my heaven, No second morn has ever shone for me; All my life's bliss from thy dear life was given, All my life's bliss is in the grave with thee. But, when the days of golden dreams had perished, And even Despair was powerless to destroy; Then did I learn how existence could be cherished, Strengthened, and fed without the aid of joy. Then did I check the tears of useless passion— Weaned my young soul from yearning after thine; Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten Down to that tomb already more than mine. And, even yet, I dare not let it languish, Dare not indulge in memory's rapturous pain; Once drinking deep of that divinest anguish, How could I seek the empty world again? v. A Death-Scene ‘O Day! he cannot die When thou so fair art shining! O Sun, in such a glorious sky, So tranquilly declining; ‘He cannot leave thee now, While fresh west winds are blowing, And all around his youthful brow Thy cheerful light is glowing! ‘Edward, awake, awake— The golden evening gleams Warm and bright on Arden's lake— Arouse thee from thy dreams! ‘Beside thee, on my knee, My dearest friend! I pray That thou, to cross the eternal sea, Wouldst yet one hour delay: ‘I hear its billows roar— I see them foaming high; But no glimpse of a further shore Has blest my straining eye. ‘Believe not what they urge Of Eden isles beyond; Turn back, from that tempestuous surge, To thy own native land. ‘It is not death, but pain That struggles in thy breast— Nay, rally, Edward, rouse again; I cannot let thee rest!’ One long look, that sore reproved me For the woe I could not bear— One mute look of suffering moved me To repent my useless prayer: And, with sudden check, the heaving Of distraction passed away; Not a sign of further grieving Stirred my soul that awful day. Paled, at length, the sweet sun setting; Sunk to peace the twilight breeze: Summer dews fell softly, wetting Glen, and glade, and silent trees. Then his eyes began to weary, Weighed beneath a mortal sleep; And their orbs grew strangely dreary, Clouded, even as they would weep. But they wept not, but they changed not, Never moved, and never closed; Troubled still, and still they ranged not— Wandered not, nor yet reposed! So I knew that he was dying— Stooped, and raised his languid head; Felt no breath, and heard no sighing, So I knew that he was dead. vi. Song [The linnet in the rocky dells] The linnet in the rocky dells, The moor-lark in the air, The bee among the heather bells, That hide my lady fair: The wild deer browse above her breast; The wild birds raise their brood; And they, her smiles of love caressed, Have left her solitude! I ween, that when the grave's dark wall Did first her form retain; They thought their hearts could ne'er recall The light of joy again. They thought the tide of grief would flow Unchecked through future years; But where is all their anguish now, And where are all their tears? Well, let them fight for honour's breath, Or pleasure's shade pursue— The dweller in the land of death Is changed and careless too. And, if their eyes should watch and weep Till sorrow's source were dry, She would not, in her tranquil sleep, Return a single sigh! Blow, west-wind, by the lonely mound, And murmur, summer-streams— There is no need of other sound To soothe my lady's dreams. vii. Anticipation How beautiful the earth is still, To thee—how full of happiness! How little fraught with real ill, Or unreal phantoms of distress! How spring can bring thee glory, yet, And summer win thee to forget December's sullen time! Why dost thou hold the treasure fast, Of youth's delight, when youth is past, And thou art near thy prime? When those who were thy own compeers, Equals in fortune and in years, Have seen their morning melt in tears, To clouded, smileless day; Blest, had they died untried and young, Before their hearts went wandering wrong, Poor slaves, subdued by passions strong, A weak and helpless prey! ‘Because, I hoped while they enjoyed, And, by fulfilment, hope destroyed; As children hope, with trustful breast, I waited bliss—and cherished rest. A thoughtful spirit taught me, soon, That we must long till life be done; That every phase of earthly joy Must always fade, and always cloy: ‘This I foresaw—and would not chase The fleeting treacheries; But, with firm foot and tranquil face, Held backward from that tempting race, Gazed o'er the sands the waves efface, To the enduring seas— There cast my anchor of desire Deep in unknown eternity; Nor ever let my spirit tire, With looking for what is to be! ‘It is hope's spell that glorifies, Like youth, to my maturer eyes, All Nature's million mysteries, The fearful and the fair— Hope soothes me in the griefs I know; She lulls my pain for others' woe, And makes me strong to undergo What I am born to bear. ‘Glad comforter! will I not brave, Unawed, the darkness of the grave? Nay, smile to hear Death's billows rave— Sustained, my guide, by thee? The more unjust seems present fate, The more my spirit swells elate, Strong, in thy strength, to anticipate Rewarding destiny!’ viii. The Prisoner (A Fragment) In the dungeon-crypts, idly did I stray, Reckless of the lives wasting there away; ‘Draw the ponderous bars! open, Warder stern!’ He dared not say me nay—the hinges harshly turn. ‘Our guests are darkly lodged,’ I whisper'd, gazing through The vault, whose grated eye showed heaven more grey than blue; (This was when glad spring laughed in awaking pride;) ‘Aye, darkly lodged enough!’ returned my sullen guide. Then, God forgive my youth; forgive my careless tongue; I scoffed, as chill chains on the damp flag-stones rung: ‘Confined in triple walls, art thou so much to fear, That we must bind thee down and clench thy fetters here?’ The captive raised her face, it was as soft and mild As sculptured marble saint, or slumbering unwean'd child; It was so soft and mild, it was so sweet and fair, Pain could not trace a line, nor grief a shadow there! The captive raised her hand and pressed it to her brow; ‘I have been struck,’ she said, ‘and I am suffering now; Yet these are little worth, your bolts and irons strong, And, were they forged in steel, they could not hold me long.’ Hoarse laughed the jailer grim: ‘Shall I be won to hear; Dost think, fond, dreaming wretch, that I shall grant thy prayer? Or, better still, wilt melt my master's heart with groans? Ah! sooner might the sun thaw down these granite stones. ‘My master's voice is low, his aspect bland and kind, But hard as hardest flint, the soul that lurks behind; And I am rough and rude, yet not more rough to see Than is the hidden ghost that has its home in me.’ About her lips there played a smile of almost scorn, ‘My friend,’ she gently said, ‘you have not heard me mourn; When you my kindred's lives, my lost life, can restore, Then may I weep and sue,—but never, friend, before! ‘Still, let my tyrants know, I am not doomed to wear Year after year in gloom, and desolate despair; A messenger of Hope, comes every night to me, And offers for short life, eternal liberty. ‘He comes with western winds, with evening's wandering airs, With that clear dusk of heaven that brings the thickest stars. Winds take a pensive tone, and stars a tender fire, And visions rise, and change, that kill me with desire. ‘Desire for nothing known in my maturer years, When Joy grew mad with awe, at counting future tears. When, if my spirit's sky was full of flashes warm, I knew not whence they came, from sun, or thunder storm. ‘But, first, a hush of peace—a soundless calm descends; The struggle of distress, and fierce impatience ends. Mute music soothes my breast, unuttered harmony, That I could never dream, till Earth was lost to me. ‘Then dawns the Invisible; the Unseen its truth reveals; My outward sense is gone, my inward essence feels: Its wings are almost free—its home, its harbour found, Measuring the gulf, it stoops, and dares the final bound. ‘Oh, dreadful is the check—intense the agony— When the ear begins to hear, and the eye begins to see; When the pulse begins to throb, the brain to think again, The soul to feel the flesh, and the flesh to feel the chain. ‘Yet I would lose no sting, would wish no torture less, The more that anguish racks, the earlier it will bless; And robed in fires of hell, or bright with heavenly shine, If it but herald death, the vision is divine!’ She ceased to speak, and we, unanswering, turned to go— We had no further power to work the captive woe: Her cheek, her gleaming eye, declared that man had given A sentence, unapproved, and overruled by Heaven. ix. Hope Hope was but a timid friend; She sat without the grated den, Watching how my fate would tend, Even as selfish-hearted men. She was cruel in her fear; Through the bars, one dreary day, I looked out to see her there, And she turned her face away! Like a false guard, false watch keeping, Still in strife, she whispered peace; She would sing while I was weeping; If I listened, she would cease. False she was, and unrelenting; When my last joys strewed the ground, Even Sorrow saw, repenting, Those sad relics scattered round; Hope, whose whisper would have given Balm to all my frenzied pain, Stretched her wings, and soared to heaven, Went, and ne'er returned again! x. A Day Dream On a sunny brae, alone I lay One summer afternoon; It was the marriage-time of May With her young lover, June. From her mother's heart, seemed loath to part That queen of bridal charms, But her father smiled on the fairest child He ever held in his arms. The trees did wave their plumy crests, The glad birds carolled clear; And I, of all the wedding guests, Was only sullen there! There was not one, but wished to shun My aspect void of cheer; The very grey rocks, looking on, Asked, ‘What do you here?’ And I could utter no reply; In sooth, I did not know Why I had brought a clouded eye To greet the general glow. So, resting on a heathy bank, I took my heart to me; And we together sadly sank Into a reverie. We thought, ‘When winter comes again, Where will these bright things be? All vanished, like a vision vain, An unreal mockery! ‘The birds that now so blithely sing, Through deserts, frozen dry, Poor spectres of the perished spring, In famished troops, will fly. ‘And why should we be glad at all? The leaf is hardly green, Before a token of its fall Is on the surface seen!’ Now, whether it were really so, I never could be sure; But as in fit of peevish woe, I stretched me on the moor, A thousand thousand gleaming fires Seemed kindling in the air; A thousand thousand silvery lyres Resounded far and near: Methought, the very breath I breathed Was full of sparks divine, And all my heather-couch was wreathed By that celestial shine! And, while the wide earth echoing rung To their strange minstrelsy, The little glittering spirits sung, Or seemed to sing, to me. ‘O mortal! mortal! let them die; Let time and tears destroy, That we may overflow the sky With universal joy! ‘Let grief distract the sufferer's breast, And night obscure his way; They hasten him to endless rest, And everlasting day. ‘To thee the world is like a tomb, A desert's naked shore; To us, in unimagined bloom, It brightens more and more! ‘And could we lift the veil, and give One brief glimpse to thine eye, Thou wouldst rejoice for those that live, Because they live to die.’ The music ceased; the noonday dream, Like dream of night, withdrew; But Fancy, still, will sometimes deem Her fond creation true. xi. To Imagination When weary with the long day's care, And earthly change from pain to pain, And lost and ready to despair, Thy kind voice calls me back again: Oh, my true friend! I am not lone, While thou canst speak with such a tone! So hopeless is the world without; The world within I doubly prize; Thy world, where guile, and hate, and doubt, And cold suspicion never rise; Where thou, and I, and Liberty, Have undisputed sovereignty. What matters it, that, all around, Danger, and guilt, and darkness lie, If but within our bosom's bound We hold a bright, untroubled sky, Warm with ten thousand mingled rays Of suns that know no winter days? Reason, indeed, may oft complain For Nature's sad reality, And tell the suffering heart how vain Its cherished dreams must always be; And Truth may rudely trample down The flowers of Fancy, newly-blown: But, thou art ever there, to bring The hovering vision back, and breathe New glories o'er the blighted spring, And call a lovelier Life from Death, And whisper, with a voice divine, Of real worlds, as bright as thine. I trust not to thy phantom bliss, Yet, still, in evening's quiet hour, With never-failing thankfulness, I welcome thee, Benignant Power; Sure solacer of human cares, And sweeter hope, when hope despairs! xii. How Clear She Shines How clear she shines! How quietly I lie beneath her guardian light; While heaven and earth are whispering me, ‘Tomorrow, wake, but, dream tonight.’ Yes, Fancy, come, my Fairy love! These throbbing temples softly kiss; And bend my lonely couch above And bring me rest, and bring me bliss. The world is going; dark world, adieu! Grim world, conceal thee till the day; The heart, thou canst not all subdue, Must still resist, if thou delay! Thy love I will not, will not share; Thy hatred only wakes a smile; Thy griefs may wound—thy wrongs may tear, But, oh, thy lies shall ne'er beguile! While gazing on the stars that glow Above me, in that stormless sea, I long to hope that all the woe Creation knows, is held in thee! And this shall be my dream tonight; I'll think the heaven of glorious spheres Is rolling on its course of light In endless bliss, through endless years; I'll think, there's not one world above, Far as these straining eyes can see, Where wisdom ever laughed at Love, Or Virtue crouched to Infamy; Where, writhing 'neath the strokes of Fate, The mangled wretch was forced to smile; To match his patience 'gainst her hate, His heart rebellious all the while. Where Pleasure still will lead to wrong, And helpless Reason warn in vain; And Truth is weak, and Treachery strong; And Joy the surest path to Pain; And Peace, the lethargy of Grief; And Hope, a phantom of the soul; And Life, a labour, void and brief; And Death, the despot of the whole! xiii. Sympathy There should be no despair for you While nightly stars are burning; While evening pours its silent dew And sunshine gilds the morning. There should be no despair—though tears May flow down like a river: Are not the best beloved of years Around your heart for ever? They weep, you weep, it must be so; Winds sigh as you are sighing, And Winter sheds his grief in snow Where Autumn's leaves are lying: Yet, these revive, and from their fate Your fate cannot be parted: Then, journey on, if not elate, Still, never broken-hearted! xiv. Plead for Me Oh, thy bright eyes must answer now, When Reason, with a scornful brow, Is mocking at my overthrow! Oh, thy sweet tongue must plead for me And tell, why I have chosen thee! Stern Reason is to judgment come, Arrayed in all her forms of gloom: Wilt thou, my advocate, be dumb? No, radiant angel, speak and say, Why I did cast the world away. Why I have persevered to shun The common paths that others run, And on a strange road journeyed on, Heedless, alike, of wealth and power— Of glory's wreath and pleasure's flower. These, once, indeed, seemed Beings Divine; And they, perchance, heard vows of mine, And saw my offerings on their shrine; But, careless gifts are seldom prized, And mine were worthily despised. So, with a ready heart I swore To seek their altar-stone no more; And gave my spirit to adore Thee, ever-present, phantom thing; My slave, my comrade, and my king, A slave, because I rule thee still; Incline thee to my changeful will, And make thy influence good or ill: A comrade, for by day and night Thou art my intimate delight,— My darling pain that wounds and sears And wrings a blessing out from tears By deadening me to earthly cares; And yet, a king, though Prudence well Have taught thy subject to rebel. And am I wrong to worship, where Faith cannot doubt, nor hope despair, Since my own soul can grant my prayer? Speak, God of visions, plead for me, And tell why I have chosen thee! xv. Self-Interrogation ‘The evening passes fast away, 'Tis almost time to rest; What thoughts has left the vanished day, What feelings, in thy breast?’ ‘The vanished day? It leaves a sense Of labour hardly done; Of little, gained with vast expense,— A sense of grief alone! ‘Time stands before the door of Death, Upbraiding bitterly; And Conscience, with exhaustless breath, Pours black reproach on me: ‘And though I've said that Conscience lies, And Time should Fate condemn; Still, sad Repentance clouds my eyes, And makes me yield to them!’ ‘Then art thou glad to seek repose? Art glad to leave the sea, And anchor all thy weary woes In calm Eternity? ‘Nothing regrets to see thee go— Not one voice sobs “farewell”, And where thy heart has suffered so, Canst thou desire to dwell?’ ‘Alas! The countless links are strong That bind us to our clay; The loving spirit lingers long, And would not pass away! ‘And rest is sweet, when laurelled fame Will crown the soldier's crest; But, a brave heart, with a tarnished name, Would rather fight than rest.’ ‘Well, thou hast fought for many a year, Hast fought thy whole life through, Hast humbled Falsehood, trampled Fear; What is there left to do?’ ‘'Tis true, this arm has hotly striven, Has dared what few would dare; Much have I done, and freely given, But little learnt to bear!’ ‘Look on the grave, where thou must sleep, Thy last, and strongest foe; It is endurance not to weep, If that repose seem woe. ‘The long war closing in defeat, Defeat serenely borne, Thy midnight rest may still be sweet, And break in glorious morn!’ xvi. Death Death! that struck when I was most confiding In my certain faith of joy to be— Strike again, Time's withered branch dividing From the fresh root of Eternity! Leaves, upon Time's branch, were growing brightly, Full of sap, and full of silver dew; Birds beneath its shelter gathered nightly; Daily round its flowers the wild bees flew. Sorrow passed, and plucked the golden blossom; Guilt stripped off the foliage in its pride; But, within its parent's kindly bosom, Flowed for ever Life's restoring tide. Little mourned I for the parted gladness, For the vacant nest and silent song— Hope was there, and laughed me out of sadness; Whispering, ‘Winter will not linger long!’ And, behold! with tenfold increase blessing, Spring adorned the beauty-burdened spray; Wind and rain and fervent heat, caressing, Lavished glory on that second May! High it rose—no winged grief could sweep it; Sin was scared to distance with its shine; Love, and its own life, had power to keep it From all wrong—from every blight but thine! Cruel Death! The young leaves droop and languish; Evening's gentle air may still restore— No! the morning sunshine mocks my anguish— Time, for me, must never blossom more! Strike it down, that other boughs may flourish Where that perished sapling used to be; Thus, at least, its mouldering corpse will nourish That from which it sprung—Eternity. xvii. Stanzas to ? Well, some may hate, and some may scorn, And some may quite forget thy name; But my sad heart must ever mourn Thy ruined hopes, thy blighted fame! 'Twas thus I thought, an hour ago, Even weeping o'er that wretch's woe; One word turned back my gushing tears, And lit my altered eye with sneers. Then ‘Bless the friendly dust,’ I said, ‘That hides thy unlamented head! Vain as thou wert, and weak as vain, The slave of Falsehood, Pride, and Pain,— My heart has nought akin to thine; Thy soul is powerless over mine.’ But these were thoughts that vanished too; Unwise, unholy, and untrue: Do I despise the timid deer, Because his limbs are fleet with fear? Or, would I mock the wolf's death-howl, Because his form is gaunt and foul? Or, hear with joy the leveret's cry, Because it cannot bravely die? No! Then above his memory Let Pity's heart as tender be; Say, ‘Earth, lie lightly on that breast And, kind Heaven, grant that spirit rest!’ xviii. Honour's Martyr The moon is full this winter night; The stars are clear, though few; And every window glistens bright, With leaves of frozen dew. The sweet moon through your lattice gleams And lights your room like day; And there you pass, in happy dreams, The peaceful hours away! While I, with effort hardly quelling The anguish in my breast, Wander about the silent dwelling, And cannot think of rest. The old clock in the gloomy hall Ticks on, from hour to hour; And every time its measured call Seems lingering slow and slower: And oh, how slow that keen-eyed star Has tracked the chilly grey! What, watching yet! how very far The morning lies away! Without your chamber door I stand; Love, are you slumbering still? My cold heart, underneath my hand, Has almost ceased to thrill. Bleak, bleak the east wind sobs and sighs, And drowns the turret bell, Whose sad note, undistinguished, dies Unheard, like my farewell! Tomorrow, Scorn will blight my name, And Hate will trample me, Will load me with a coward's shame— A traitor's perjury. False friends will launch their covert sneers; True friends will wish me dead; And I shall cause the bitterest tears That you have ever shed. The dark deeds of my outlawed race Will then like virtues shine; And men will pardon their disgrace, Beside the guilt of mine. For, who forgives the accursed crime Of dastard treachery? Rebellion, in its chosen time, May Freedom's champion be; Revenge may stain a righteous sword, It may be just to slay; But, traitor, traitor,—from that word All true breasts shrink away! Oh, I would give my heart to death, To keep my honour fair; Yet, I'll not give my inward faith My honour's name to spare! Not even to keep your priceless love, Dare I, Beloved, deceive; This treason should the future prove, Then, only then, believe! I know the path I ought to go; I follow fearlessly, Inquiring not what deeper woe Stern duty stores for me. So foes pursue, and cold allies Mistrust me, every one: Let me be false in others' eyes, If faithful in my own. xix. Stanzas I'll not weep that thou art going to leave me, There's nothing lovely here; And doubly will the dark world grieve me, While thy heart suffers there. I'll not weep, because the summer's glory Must always end in gloom; And, follow out the happiest story— It closes with a tomb! And I am weary of the anguish Increasing winters bear; Weary to watch the spirit languish Through years of dead despair. So, if a tear, when thou art dying, Should haply fall from me, It is but that my soul is sighing, To go and rest with thee. xx. My Comforter Well hast thou spoken, and yet, not taught A feeling strange or new; Thou hast but roused a latent thought, A cloud-closed beam of sunshine, brought To gleam in open view. Deep down, concealed within my soul, That light lies hid from men; Yet, glows unquenched—though shadows roll, Its gentle ray cannot control, About the sullen den. Was I not vexed, in these gloomy ways To walk alone so long? Around me, wretches uttering praise, Or howling o'er their hopeless days, And each with Frenzy's tongue;— A brotherhood of misery, Their smiles as sad as sighs; Whose madness daily maddened me, Distorting into agony The bliss before my eyes! So stood I, in Heaven's glorious sun, And in the glare of Hell; My spirit drank a mingled tone, Of seraph's song, and demon's moan; What my soul bore, my soul alone Within itself may tell! Like a soft air, above a sea, Tossed by the tempest's stir; A thaw-wind, melting quietly The snow-drift, on some wintry lea; No: what sweet thing resembles thee, My thoughtful Comforter? And yet a little longer speak, Calm this resentful mood; And while the savage heart grows meek, For other token do not seek, But let the tear upon my cheek Evince my gratitude! xxi. The Old Stoic Riches I hold in light esteem; And Love I laugh to scorn; And lust of fame was but a dream That vanished with the morn: And if I pray, the only prayer That moves my lips for me Is, ‘Leave the heart that now I bear, And give me liberty!’ Yes, as my swift days near their goal, 'Tis all that I implore; In life and death, a chainless soul, With courage to endure.</field>

[Cold clear and blue the morning heaven] Cold clear and blue the morning heaven Expands its arch on high Cold clear and blue Lake Werna's water Reflects that winter's sky The moon has set but Venus shines A silent silvery star 2. [Will the day be bright or cloudy?] Will the day be bright or cloudy? Sweetly has its dawn begun But the heaven may shake with thunder Ere the setting of the sun Lady watch Apollo's journey Thus thy first born's course shall be— If his beams through summer vapours Warm the earth all placidly Her days shall pass like a pleasant dream in sweet tranquillity If it darken if a shadow Quench his rays and summon rain Flowers may open buds may blossom Bud and flower alike are vain Her days shall pass like a mournful story in care and tears and pain If the wind be fresh and free The wide skies clear and cloudless blue The woods and fields and golden flowers Sparkling in sunshine and in dew Her days shall pass in Glory's light the world's drear desert through 3. [Tell me tell me smiling child] Tell me tell me smiling child What the past is like to thee? An Autumn evening soft and mild With a wind that sighs mournfully Tell me what is the present hour? A green and flowery spray Where a young bird sits gathering its power To mount and fly away And what is the future happy one? A sea beneath a cloudless sun A mighty glorious dazzling sea Stretching into infinity 4. [The inspiring music's thrilling sound] The inspiring music's thrilling sound The glory of the festal day The glittering splendour rising round Have passed like all earth's joys away Forsaken by that Lady fair She glides unheeding through them all Covering her brow to hide the tear That still though checked trembles to fall She hurries through the outer Hall And up the stairs through galleries dim That murmur to the breezes' call The night-wind's lonely vesper hymn 5. [High waving heather 'neath stormy blasts bending] High waving heather 'neath stormy blasts bending Midnight and moonlight and bright shining stars Darkness and glory rejoicingly blending Earth rising to heaven and heaven descending Man's spirit away from its drear dungeon sending Bursting the fetters and breaking the bars All down the mountain sides wild forests lending One mighty voice to the life giving wind Rivers their banks in the jubilee rending Fast through the valleys a reckless course wending Wider and deeper their waters extending Leaving a desolate desert behind Shining and lowering and swelling and dying Changing forever from midnight to noon Roaring like thunder like soft music sighing Shadows on shadows advancing and flying Lightning bright flashes the deep gloom defying Coming as swiftly and fading as soon 6. [Woods you need not frown on me] Woods you need not frown on me Spectral trees that so dolefully Shake your heads in the dreary sky You need not mock so bitterly 7. [Start not upon the minster wall] Start not upon the minster wall Sunshine is shed in holy calm And lonely though my footsteps fall The saints shall shelter thee from harm Shrink not if it be summer noon This shadow should right welcome be These stairs are steep but landed soon We'll rest us long and quietly What though our path be o'er the dead They slumber soundly in the tomb And why should mortals fear to tread The pathway to their future home? 8. [Redbreast early in the morning] Redbreast early in the morning Dark and cold and cloudy grey Wildly tender is thy music Chasing [the angry] thoughts away My heart is not enraptured now My eyes are full of tears And constant sorrow on my brow Has done the work of years It was not hope that wrecked at once The spirit's [early] storm But a long life of solitude Hopes quenched and rising thoughts subdued A bleak November's calm What woke it then? A little child Strayed from its father's cottage door And in the hour of moonlight mild Laid lonely on the desert moor I heard it then you heard it too And seraph sweet it sang to you But like the shriek of misery That wild wild music wailed to me 9. [Through the hours of yesternight] Through the hours of yesternight Hall and gallery blazed with light Every lamp its lustre showered On the adorer and the adored None were sad that entered there All were loved and all were fair Some were dazzling like the sun Shining down at summer noon Some were sweet as amber even Living in the depth of heaven Some were soft and kind and gay Morning's face not more divine Some were like Diana's day Midnight moonlight's holy shine 10. [There shines the moon, at noon of night—] There shines the moon, at noon of night— Vision of glory—Dream of light! Holy as heaven—undimmed and pure, Looking down on the lonely moor— And lonelier still beneath her ray That drear moor stretches far away Till it seems strange that aught can lie Beyond its zone of silver sky— Bright moon—dear moon! when years have past My weary feet return at last— And still upon Lake Elnor's breast Thy solemn rays serenely rest And still the Fern-leaves sighing wave Like mourners over Elbë's grave And Earth's the same but Oh to see How wildly Time has altered me! Am I the being who long ago Sat watching by that water side The light of life expiring slow From his fair cheek and brow of pride? Not oft these mountains feel the shine Of such a day—as fading then, Cast from its fount of gold divine A last smile on the heathery plain And kissed the far-off peaks of snow That gleaming on the horizon shone As if in summer's warmest glow Stern winter claimed a loftier throne— And there he lay among the bloom His red blood dyed a deeper hue Shuddering to feel the ghostly gloom That coming Death around him threw— Sickening to think one hour would sever The sweet, sweet world and him forever To think that twilight gathering dim Would never pass away to him— No—never more! That awful thought A thousand dreary feelings brought, And memory all her powers combined And rushed upon his fainting mind. Wide, swelling woodlands seemed to rise Beneath soft, sunny, southern skies— Old Elbë Hall his noble home Towered 'mid its trees, whose foliage green Rustled with the kind airs that come From summer Heavens when most serene And bursting through the leafy shade A gush of golden sunshine played; Bathing the walls in amber light And sparkling in the water clear That stretched below—reflected bright The whole wide world of cloudless air— And still before his spirit's eye Such well known scenes would rise and fly Till, maddening with despair and pain He turned his dying face to me And wildly cried, ‘Oh once again Might I my native country see! But once again—one single day! And must it—can it never be? To die—and die so far away When life has hardly smiled for me— Augusta—you will soon return Back to that land in health and bloom And then the heath alone will mourn Above my unremembered tomb For you'll forget the lonely grave And mouldering corpse by Elnor's wave’— 11. [The night of storms has passed] The night of storms has passed The sunshine bright and clear Gives glory to the verdant waste And warms the breezy air And I would leave my bed Its cheering smile to see To chase the visions from my head Whose forms have troubled me In all the hours of gloom My soul was rapt away I dreamt I stood by a marble tomb Where royal corpses lay It was just the time of eve When parted ghosts might come Above their prisoned dust to grieve And wail their woeful doom And truly at my side I saw a shadowy thing Most dim and yet its presence there Curdled my blood with ghastly fear And ghastlier wondering My breath I could not draw The air seemed ranny But still my eyes with maddening gaze Were fixed upon its fearful face And its were fixed on me I fell down on the stone But could [not] turn away My words died in a voiceless moan When I began to pray And still it bent above Its features full in view It seemed close by and yet more far Than this world from the farthest star That tracks the boundless blue Indeed 'twas not the space Of earth or time between But the sea of death's eternity The gulf o'er which mortality Has never never been O bring not back again The horror of that hour When its lips opened and a sound Awoke the stillness reigning round Faint as a dream but the earth shrank And heaven's lights shivered 'neath its power ‘Woe for the day Regina's pride Regina's hope is in the grave And who shall rule my land beside And who shall save ‘Woe for the day with gory tears My country's sons this day shall rue Woe for the day a thousand years Can not repair what one shall do ‘Woe for the day’ mixed with the wind That sad lament was ringing It almost broke my heart to hear Such dreary dreary singing 12. [I saw thee child one summer's day] I saw thee child one summer's day Suddenly leave thy cheerful play And in the green grass lowly lying I listened to thy mournful sighing I knew the wish that waked that wail I knew the source whence sprung those tears You longed for fate to raise the veil That darkened over coming years The anxious prayer was heard and power Was given me in that silent hour To open to an infant's eye The portals of futurity But child of dust the fragrant flowers The bright blue sky and velvet sod Were strange conductors to the bowers Thy daring footsteps must have trod I watched my time and summer passed And Autumn waning fleeted by And doleful winter nights at last In cloudy mourning clothed the sky And now I'm come this evening fell Not stormily but stilly drear A sound sweeps o'er thee like a knell To banish joy and welcome care A fluttering blast that shakes the leaves And whistles round the gloomy wall And lingering long lamenting grieves For 'tis the spectre's call He hears me what a sudden start Sent the blood icy to that heart He wakens and how ghastly white That face looks in the dim lamplight Those tiny hands in vain essay To thrust the shadowy fiend away There is a horror on his brow An anguish in his bosom now A fearful anguish in his eyes Fixed strainedly on the vacant air Heavily bursts in long drawn sighs His panting breath enchained by fear Poor child if spirits such as I Could weep o'er human misery A tear might flow aye many a tear To see the road that lies before To see the sunshine disappear And hear the stormy waters roar Breaking upon a desolate shore Cut off from hope in early day From power and glory cut away But it is doomed and morning's light Must image forth the scowl of night And childhood's flower must waste its bloom Beneath the shadow of the tomb 13. [Sleep not dream not this bright day] Sleep not dream not this bright day Will not cannot last for aye Bliss like thine is bought by years Dark with torment and with tears Sweeter far than placid pleasure Purer higher beyond measure Yet alas the sooner turning Into hopeless endless mourning I love thee boy for all divine All full of God thy features shine Darling enthusiast holy child Too good for this world's warring wild Too heavenly now but doomed to be Hell-like in heart and misery And what shall change that angel brow And quench that spirit's glorious glow Relentless laws that disallow True virtue and true joy below And blame me not if when the dread Of suffering clouds thy youthful head If when by crime and sorrow tos[t] Thy wandering bark is wrecked and los[t] I too depart I too decline And make thy path no longer mine 'Tis thus that human minds will turn All doomed alike to sin and mourn Yet all with long gaze fixed afar Adoring virtue's distant star 14. [O God of heaven! the dream of horror] O God of heaven! the dream of horror The frightful dream is over now The sickened heart the blasting sorrow The ghastly night the ghastlier morrow The aching sense of utter woe. The burning tears that would keep welling The groans that mocked at every tear That burst from out their dreary dwelling As if each gasp were life expelling But life was nourished by despair The tossing and the anguished pining The grinding teeth and staring eye The agony of still repining When not a spark of hope was shining From gloomy fate's relentless sky The impatient rage the useless shrinking From thoughts that yet could not be borne The soul that was for ever thinking Till nature maddened tortured sinking At last refused to mourn— It's over now—and I am free And the ocean wind is caressing me The wild wind from that wavy main I never thought to see again Bless thee Bright Sea—and glorious dome And my own world my spirit's home Bless thee—Bless all—I can not speak My voice is choked, but not with grief And salt drops from my haggard cheek Descend like rain upon the heath How long they've wet a dungeon floor— Falling on flag-stones damp and grey I used to weep even in my sleep The night was dreadful like the day I used to weep when winter's snow Whirled through the grating stormily But then it was a calmer woe For every thing was drear as me The bitterest time the worst of all Was that in which the summer sheen Cast a green lustre on the wall That told of Fields of lovelier green Often I've sat down on the ground Gazing up to that flush scarce seen Till heedless of the darkness round My soul has sought a land serene It sought the arch of heaven divine The pure blue heaven with clouds of gold It sought thy Father's home and mine As I remembered it of old O even now too horribly Come back the feelings that would swell When with my face hid on my knee I strove the bursting groans to quell I flung myself upon the stone I howled and tore my tangled hair And then when the first gush had flown Lay in unspeakable despair Sometimes a curse sometimes a prayer Would quiver on my parched tongue But both without a murmur there Died in the breast from whence they sprung And so the day would fade on high And darkness quench that lonely beam And slumber mould my misery Into some strange and spectral dream Whose phantom horrors made me know The worst extent of human woe— But this is past and why return O'er such a past to brood and mourn? Shake off the fetters break the chain And live and love and smile again The waste of youth the waste of years Departed in that dungeon's thrall The gnawing grief the hopeless tears Forget them—O forget them all— 15. [The battle had passed from the height] The battle had passed from the height And still did evening fall While heaven with its hosts of night Gloriously canopied all The dead around were sleeping On heath and granite grey And the dying their last watch were keeping In the closing of the day How golden bright from earth and heaven The summer day declines How gloriously o'er land and sea The parting sunbeam shines There is a voice in the wind that waves Those bright rejoicing trees Not a vapour had stained the breezeless blue Not a cloud had dimmed the sun From the time of morning's earliest dew Till the summer day was done And all as pure and all as bright The [beam] of evening died And purer still its parting light Shone in Lake Elnor's tide Waveless and calm lies that silent deep In its wilderness of moors Solemn and soft the moonbeams sleep Upon its heathy shores The deer are gathered to their rest The wild sheep seek the fold Only some spires of bright green grass Transparently in sunshine quivering 16. [The sun has set and the long grass now] The sun has set and the long grass now Waves drearily in the evening wind And the wild bird has flown from that old grey stone In some warm nook a couch to find In all the lonely landscape round I see no sight and hear no sound Except the wind that far away Comes sighing o'er the heathy sea 17. [Lady in your Palace Hall] Lady in your Palace Hall Once perchance my face was seen Can no memory now recall Thought again to what has been 18. [And first an hour of mournful musing] And first an hour of mournful musing And then a gush of bitter tears And then a dreary calm diffusing Its deadly mist o'er joys and cares And then a throb and then a lightening And then a breathing from above And then a star in heaven brightening The star the glorious star of love 19. [Wind sink to rest in the heather] Wind sink to rest in the heather Thy wild voice suits not me I would have dreary weather But all devoid of thee Sun set from that evening heaven Thy glad smile wins not mine If light at all is given O give me Cynthia's shine 20. [Long neglect has worn away] Long neglect has worn away Half the sweet enchanting smile Time has turned the bloom to grey Mould and damp the face defile But that lock of silky hair Still beneath the picture twined Tells what once those features were Paints their image on the mind Fair the hand that traced that line ‘Dearest ever deem me true’ Swiftly flew the fingers fine When the pen that motto drew 21. [Awaking morning laughs from heaven] Awaking morning laughs from heaven On golden summer's forests green And what a gush of song is given To welcome in that light serene A fresh wind waves the clustering roses And through the open window sighs Around the couch where she reposes The lady with the dovelike eyes With dovelike eyes and shining hair And velvet cheek so sweetly moulded And hands so soft and white and fair Above her snowy bosom folded Her sister's and her brother's feet Are brushing off the scented dew And she springs up in haste to greet The grass and flowers and sunshine too 22. [Alone I sat the summer day] Alone I sat the summer day Had died in smiling light away I saw it die I watched it fade From misty hill and breezeless glade And thoughts in my soul were rushing And my heart bowed beneath their power And tears within my eyes were gushing Because I could not speak the feeling The solemn joy around me stealing In that divine untroubled hour I asked my self O why has heaven Denied the precious gift to me The glorious gift to many given To speak their thoughts in poetry Dreams have encircled me I said From careless childhood's sunny time Visions by ardent fancy fed Since life was in its morning prime But now when I had hoped to sing My fingers strike a tuneless string And still the burden of the strain Is strive no more 'tis all in vain 23.

Lord of Elbë, on Elbë hill The mist is thick and the wind is chill And the heart of thy Friend from the dawn of day Has sighed for sorrow that thou went away— Lord of Elbë, how pleasant to me The sound of thy blithesome step would be Rustling the heath that, only now Waves as the night-gusts over it blow Bright are the fires in thy lonely home I see them far off, and as deepens the gloom Gleaming like stars through the high forest-boughs Gladder they glow in the park's repose— O Alexander! when I return, Warm as those hearths my heart would burn, Light as thine own, my foot would fall If I might hear thy voice in the hall— But thou art now on a desolate sea— Parted from Gondal and parted from me— All my repining is hopeless and vain, Death never yields back his victims again— 24. [The organ swells the trumpets sound] The organ swells the trumpets sound The lamps in triumph glow And none of all those thousands round Regards who sleeps below Those haughty eyes that tears should fill Glance clearly cloudlessly Those bounding breasts that grief should thrill From thought of grief are free His subjects and his soldiers there They blessed his rising bloom But none a single sigh can spare To breathe above his tomb Comrades in arms I've looked to mark One shade of feeling swell As your feet trod above the dark Recesses of his cell 25. [A sudden chasm of ghastly light] A sudden chasm of ghastly light Yawned in the city's reeling wall And a long thundering through the night Proclaimed our triumph—Tyrdarum's fall— The shrieking wind sank mute and mild The smothering snow-clouds rolled away And cold—how cold!—wan moonlight smiled Where those black ruins smouldering lay 'Twas over—all the Battle's madness The bursting fires the cannons' roar The yells, the groans the frenzied gladness The death the danger warmed no more In plundered churches piled with dead The heavy charger neighed for food The wounded soldier laid his head 'Neath roofless chambers splashed with blood I could not sleep through that wild siege My heart had fiercely burned and bounded The outward tumult seemed to assuage The inward tempest it surrounded But . . . cannot bear And silence whets the tang of pain I felt the full flood of despair Returning to my breast again My couch lay in a ruined Hall Whose windows looked on the minster-yard Where chill chill whiteness covered all Both stone and urn and withered sward The shattered glass let in the air And with it came a wandering moan A sound unutterably drear That made me shrink to be alone One black yew-tree grew just below I thought its boughs so sad might wail Their ghostly fingers flecked with snow Rattled against an old vault's rail I listened—no 'twas life that still Lingered in some deserted heart O God what caused that shuddering thrill? That anguished agonizing start? An undefined an awful dream A dream of what had been before A memory whose blighting beam Was flitting o'er me ever more A frightful feeling frenzy born— I hurried down the dark oak stair I reached the door whose hinges torn Flung streaks of moonshine here and there I pondered not I drew the bar An icy glory [caught] mine eye From that wide heaven where every star Glared like a dying memory And there the great cathedral rose Discrowned but most majestic so It looked down in [serene] repose On its own realm of buried woe 26. [The old church tower and garden wall] The old church tower and garden wall Are black with Autumn rain And dreary winds foreboding call The darkness down again I watched how evening took the place Of glad and glorious day I watched a deeper gloom efface The evening's lingering ray And as I gazed on the cheerless sky Sad thoughts rose in my mind 27. Lines [Far away is the land of rest] Far away is the land of rest Thousand miles are stretched between Many a mountain's stormy crest Many a desert void of green Wasted worn is the traveller Dark his heart and dim his eye Without hope or comforter Faltering faint and ready to die Often he looks to the ruthless sky Often he looks o'er his dreary road Often he wishes down to lie And render up life's tiresome load But yet faint not mournful man Leagues on leagues are left behind Since your sunless course began Then go on to toil resigned If you still despair control Hush its whispers in your breas[t] You shall reach the final goal You shall win the land of rest 28. [Now trust a heart that trusts in you] Now trust a heart that trusts in you And firmly say the word Adieu Be sure wherever I may roam My heart is with your heart at home Unless there be no truth on earth And vows meant true are nothing worth And mortal man have no control Over his own unhappy soul Unless I change in every thought And memory will restore me nought And all I have of virtue die Beneath far Gondal's Foreign sky The mountain peasant loves the heath Better than richest plains beneath He would not give one moorland wild For all the fields that ever smiled And whiter brows than yours may be And rosier cheeks my eyes may see And lightning looks from orbs divine About my pathway burn and shine But that pure light changeless and strong Cherished and watched and nursed so long That love that first its glory gave Shall be my pole star to the grave 29. [Sleep brings no joy to me] Sleep brings no joy to me Remembrance never dies My soul is given to misery And lives in sighs Sleep brings no rest to me The shadows of the dead My waking eyes may never see Surround my bed Sleep brings no hope to me In soundest sleep they come And with their doleful imagery Deepen the gloom Sleep brings no strength to me No power renewed [to] brave I only sail a wilder sea A darker wave Sleep brings no friend to me To soothe and aid to bear They all gaze on how scornfully And I despair Sleep brings no wish to knit My harassed heart beneath My only wish is to forget In the sleep of death 30. [Strong I stand though I have borne] Strong I stand though I have borne Anger hate and bitter scorn Strong I stand and laugh to see How mankind have fought with me Shade of mast'ry I contemn All the puny ways of men Free my heart my spirit free Beckon and I'll follow thee False and foolish mortal know If you scorn the world's disdain Your mean soul is far below Other worms however vain Thing of Dust—with boundless pride Dare you ask me for a guide With the humble I will be Haughty men are nought to me 31. [The night is darkening round me] The night is darkening round me The wild winds coldly blow But a tyrant spell has bound me And I cannot cannot go The giant trees are bending Their bare boughs weighed with snow And the storm is fast descending And yet I cannot go Clouds beyond clouds above me Wastes beyond wastes below But nothing drear can move me I will not cannot go I'll come when thou art saddest Laid alone in the darkened room When the mad day's mirth has vanished And the smile of joy is banished From evening's chilly gloom I'll come when the heart's [real] feeling Has entire unbiased sway And my influence o'er thee stealing Grief deepening joy congealing Shall bear thy soul away Listen 'tis just the hour The awful time for thee Dost thou not feel upon thy soul A flood of strange sensations roll Forerunners of a sterner power Heralds of me I would have touched the heavenly key That spoke alike of bliss and thee I would have woke the entrancing song But its words died upon my tongue And then I knew that hallowed strain Could never speak of joy again And then I felt 32. To a Wreath of Snow O transient voyager of heaven! O silent sign of winter skies! What adverse wind thy sail has driven To dungeons where a prisoner lies? Methinks the hands that shut the sun So sternly from this mourning brow Might still their rebel task have done And checked a thing so frail as thou They would have done it had they known The talisman that dwelt in thee, For all the suns that ever shone Have never been so kind to me! For many a week, and many a day My heart was weighed with sinking gloom When morning rose in mourning grey And faintly lit my prison room, But angel like, when I awoke, Thy silvery form so soft and fair Shining through darkness, sweetly spoke Of cloudy skies and mountains bare The dearest to a mountaineer Who, all life long has loved the snow That crowned her native summits drear, Better, than greenest plains below— And voiceless, soulless messenger Thy presence waked a thrilling tone That comforts me while thou art here And will sustain when thou art gone 33. Song by Julius Angora Awake! awake! how loud the stormy morning Calls up to life the nations resting round; Arise, Arise, is it the voice of mourning That breaks our slumber with so wild a sound? The voice of mourning? Listen to its pealing; That shout of triumph drowns the sigh of woe; Each tortured heart forgets its wonted feeling, Each faded cheek resumes its long-lost glow— Our souls are full of gladness, God has given Our arms to victory, our foes to death; The crimson ensign waves its sheet in heaven— The sea-green Standard lies in dust be[neath]. Patriots, no stain is on your country's glory Soldiers, preserve that glory bright and free Let Almedore in peace, and battle gory, Be still a nobler name for victory! 34. Lines [I die but when the grave shall press] I die but when the grave shall press The heart so long endeared to thee When earthly cares no more distress And earthly joys are nought to me Weep not, but think that I have past Before thee o'er a sea of gloom Have anchored safe and rest at last Where tears and mourning cannot come 'Tis I should weep to leave thee he[re] On that dark Ocean sailing drear With storms around and fears before And no kind light to point the shore But long or short though life may be 'Tis nothing to eternity We part below to meet on high Where blissful ages never die 35. [O mother I am not regretting] O mother I am not regretting To leave this wretched world below If there be nothing but forgetting In that dark land to which I go Yet though 'tis wretched now to languish Deceived and tired and hopeless here No heart can quite repress the anguish Of leaving things that once were dear Twice twelve short years and all is over And day and night to rise no more And never more to be a rover Along the fields the woods the shore And never more at early dawning To watch the stars of midnight wane To breathe the breath of summer morning And see its sunshine ne'er again I hear the Abbey bells are ringing Methinks their chime sound faint and drear Or else the wind is adverse winging And wafts its music from my ear The wind the winter night is speaking Of thoughts and things that should not stay Mother come near my heart is breaking I cannot bear to go away And I must go whence no returning To soothe your grief or calm your care Nay do not weep that bitter mourning Tortures my soul with wild despair No tell me that when I am lying In the old church beneath the stone You'll dry your tears and check your sighing And soon forget the spirit gone You've asked me long to tell what sorrow Has blanched my cheek and quenched my eye And we shall sever ere tomorrow So I'll confess before I die Ten years ago in last September Fernando left his home and you And still I think you must remember The anguish of that last adieu And well you know how wildly pining I longed to see his face again Through all the Autumn's drear declining Its stormy nights and days of rain Down on the skirts of Areon's forest There lies a lone and lovely glade And there the hearts together nourished Their first their fatal parting made The afternoon in softened glory So Bathed each green swell and waving tree Beyond the broad park spread before me Stretched far away the boundless sea And there I stood when he had left me With ashy cheek but tearless eye Watching the ship whose sail bereft me Of life and hope and peace and joy It past that night I sought a pillow Of sleepless woe and grieving lone My soul still hovered o'er the billow And mourned a love for ever flown Yet smiling bright in recollection One blissful hour returns to me One letter told of firm affection Of safe deliverance from the sea But not another fearing hoping Spring winter harvest glided o'er And time at length brought power for coping With thoughts I could not once endure And I would seek in summer's evening The place that saw our last farewell And there a chain of visions weaving I'd linger till the curfew bell 36. [Weaned from life and torn away] Weaned from life and torn away In the morning of thy day Bound in everlasting gloom Buried in a hopeless tomb Yet upon thy bended knee Thank the power banished thee Chain and bar and dungeon wall Saved thee from a deadlier thrall Thank the power that made thee part Ere that parting broke thy heart Wildly rushed the mountain spring From its source of fern and ling How invincible its roar Had its waters won the shore 37. [I'm happiest when most away] I'm happiest when most away I can bear my soul from its home of clay On a windy night when the moon is bright And my eye can wander through worlds of light When I am not and none beside Nor earth nor sea nor cloudless sky But only spirit wandering wide Through infinite immensity 38. [Deep deep down in the silent grave] Deep deep down in the silent grave With none to mourn above Here with my knee upon thy stone I bid adieu to feelings gone I leave with thee my tears and pain And rush into the world again O come again what chains withhold The steps that used so fleet to be— Come leave thy dwelling dark and cold Once more to visit me Was it with the fields of green Blowing flower and budding tree With the summer heaven serene That thou didst visit me? No 'twas not the flowery plain No 'twas not the fragrant air Summer skies will come again But thou wilt not be there— 39. [How loud the storm sounds round the Hall!] How loud the storm sounds round the Hall! From arch to arch from door to door Pillar and roof and granite wall Rock like a cradle in its roar That Elm tree by the haunted well Greets no returning summer skies Down with a rush the giant fell And stretched athwart the path it lies Hardly had passed the funeral train So long delayed by wind and snow And how they'll reach the house again Tomorrow's dawn perhaps will show 40. [What use is it to slumber here] What use is it to slumber here: Though the heart be sad and weary? What use is it to slumber here Though the day rise dark and dreary For that mist may break when the sun is high And this soul forget its sorrow And the rosy ray of the closing day May promise a brighter morrow 41. [O evening why is thy light so sad?] O evening why is thy light so sad? Why is the sun's last ray so cold Hush our smile is as ever glad But thy heart is growing old It's over now I've known it all I'll hide it in my heart no more But back again that night recall And think the fearful vision o'er The evening sun in cloudless shine Had passed from summer's heaven divine And dark the shades of twilight grew And stars were in the depth of blue And in the heath on mountains far From human eye and human care With thoughtful heart and tearful eye I sadly watched that solemn sky 42. [The wide cathedral Aisles are lone] The wide cathedral Aisles are lone The vast crowds vanished every one There can be nought beneath that dome But the cold tenants of the tomb O look again for still on high The lamps are burning gloriously And look again for still beneath A thousand thousand live and breathe All mute as death regard the shrine That gleams in lustre so divine Where Gondal's monarchs bending low After the hush of silent prayer Take in heaven's sight their awful vow And never dying union swear King Julius lifts his impious eye From the dark marble to the sky Blasts with that Oath his perjured soul And changeless is his cheek the while Though burning thoughts that spurn control Kindle a short and bitter smile As face to face the kinsmen stand His false hand clasped in Gerald's hand 43. [O hinder me by no delay] O hinder me by no delay My horse is weary of the way And still his breast must stem the tide Whose waves are foaming far and wide Leagues off I heard their thundering roar As fast they burst upon the shore A stronger steed than mine might dread To brave them in their boiling bed Thus spoke the traveller but in vain The stranger would not turn away Still clung she to his bridle rein And still entreated him to stay 44. [Darkness was overtraced on every face] Darkness was overtraced on every face Around clouded with storm and ominous gloom In Hut or hall smiled out no resting place There was no resting place but one—the tomb All our hearts were the mansions of distress And no one laughed and none seemed free from care Our children felt their fathers' wretchedness Our homes one all were shadowed with despair It was not fear that made the land so sad 45. [Harp of wild and dream like strain] Harp of wild and dream like strain When I touch thy strings Why dost thou repeat again Long forgotten things? Harp in other earlier days I could sing to thee And not one of all my lays Vexed my memory But now if I awake a note That gave me joy before Sounds of sorrow from thee float Changing evermore Yet still steeped in memory's dyes They come sailing on Darkening all my summer skies Shutting out my sun 46. Song to A. A. This shall be thy lullaby Rocking on the stormy sea Though it roar in thunder wild Sleep stilly sleep my dark haired child When our shuddering boat was crossing Elderno lake so rudely tossing Then 'twas first my nursling smiled Sleep softly sleep my fair-browed child Waves above thy cradle break Foamy tears are on thy cheek Yet the Ocean's self grows mild When it bears my slumbering child 47. [Why do I hate that lone green dell?] Why do I hate that lone green dell? Buried in moors and mountains wild That is a spot I had loved too well Had I but seen it when a child There are bones whitening there in the summer's heat But it is not for that and none can tell None but one can the secret repeat Why I hate that lone green dell Noble foe I pardon thee All thy cold and scornful pride For thou wast a priceless friend to me When my sad heart had none beside And leaning on thy generous arm A breath of old times over me came The earth shone round with a long lost charm Alas I forgot I was not the same Before a day—an hour passed by My spirit knew itself once more I saw the gilded vapours fly And leave me as I was before 48. A. G. A. to A. S. O wander not so far away! O love, forgive this selfish tear. It may be sad for thee to stay But how can I live lonely here? The still May morn is warm and bright Young flowers look fresh and grass is green And in the haze of glorious light Our long low hills are scarcely seen— The woods—even now their small leaves hide The blackbird and the stockdove well And high in heaven so blue and wide A thousand strains of music swell— He looks on all with eyes that speak So deep, so drear a woe to me! There is a faint red on his cheek Not like the bloom I used to see. Can Death—yes, Death, he is thine own! The grave must close those limbs around And hush, for ever hush the tone I loved above all earthly sound. Well, pass away with the other flowers Too dark for them, too dark for thee Are the hours to come, the joyless hours That Time is treasuring up for me. If thou hast sinned in this world of care 'Twas but the dust of thy drear abode— Thy soul was pure when it entered here And pure it will go again to God— 49. Gleneden's Dream Tell me, watcher, is it winter? Say how long my sleep has been? Have the woods I left so lovely, Lost their robes of tender green? Is the morning slow in coming? Is the nighttime loath to go? Tell me, are the dreary mountains Drearier still with drifted snow? ‘Captive, since thou sawest the forest All its leaves have died away And another March has woven Garlands for another May— ‘Ice has barred the Arctic water, Soft south winds have set it free And once more to deep green valley Golden flowers might welcome thee’— Watcher, in this lonely prison, Shut from joy and kindly air Heaven, descending in a vision Taught my soul to do and bear— It was night, a night of winter; I lay on the dungeon floor, And all other sounds were silent— All, except the river's roar— Over Death, and Desolation, Fireless hearths, and lifeless homes Over orphans' heart-sick sorrows, Over fathers' bloody tombs; Over friends that my arms never Might embrace, in love again— Memory pondered until madness Struck its poignard in my brain— Deepest slumber followed raving Yet, methought, I brooded still Still I saw my country bleeding Dying for a Tyrant's will— Not because my bliss was blasted Burned within, the avenging flame— Not because my scattered kindred Died in woe, or lived in shame God doth know, I would have given Every bosom dear to me Could that sacrifice have purchased Tortured Gondal's liberty! But, that at Ambition's bidding All her cherished hopes should wane; That her noblest sons should muster, Strive, and fight and fall in vain— Hut and castle, hall and cottage, Roofless, crumbling to the ground— Mighty Heaven, a glad Avenger Thy eternal justice found! Yes, the arm that once would shudder Even to pierce a wounded deer, I beheld it, unrelenting, Choke in blood its sovereign's prayer— Glorious dream! I saw the city Blazing in imperial shine; And among adoring thousands Stood a man of form divine— None need point the princely victim Now he smiles with royal pride! Now his glance is bright as lightning: Now—the knife is in his side! Ha, I saw how Death could darken— Darken that triumphant eye! His red heart's blood drenched my dagger; My ear drank his dying sigh! Shadows come! What means this midnight? O my God, I know it all! Know the fever-dream is over; Unavenged the Avengers fall! 50. [None of my kindred now can tell] None of my kindred now can tell The features once beloved so well Those dark brown locks that used to deck A snowy brow in ringlets small Now wildly shade my sunburnt neck And streaming down my shoulders fall The pure bright red of noble birth Has deepened to a gipsy glow And care has quenched the smile of mirth And tuned my heart to welcome woe Yet you must know in infancy Full many an eye watched over me Sweet voices to my slumber sung My downy couch with silk was hung And music soothed me when I cried And when I laughed they all replied And ‘rosy Blanche’ how oft was heard In hall and bower that well-known word Through gathering summers still caress'd In kingly courts a favourite guest A Monarch's hand would pour for me The richest gifts of royalty But clouds will come too soon they came For not through age and not through crime Is Blanche a now forgotten name True heart and brow unmarked by time These treasured blessings still are mine 51. ['Twas one of those dark cloudy days] 'Twas one of those dark cloudy days That sometimes come in summer's blaze When heaven drops not when earth is still And deeper green is on the hill 52. [Lonely at her window sitting] Lonely at her window sitting While the evening stole away Fitful winds foreboding flitting Through a sky of cloudy grey 53. [There are two trees in a lonely field] There are two trees in a lonely field They breathe a spell to me A dreary thought their dark boughs yield All waving solemnly 54. [What is that smoke that ever still] What is that smoke that ever still Comes rolling down that dark brown hill 55. [Still as she looked the iron clouds] Still as she looked the iron clouds Would part and sunlight shone between But drearily strange and pale and cold 56. [Away away resign me now] Away away resign me now To scenes of gloom and thoughts of fear I trace the signal on thy brow Welcome at last though once so drear 57. [It will not shine again] It will not shine again Its sad course is done I have seen the last ray wane Of the cold bright sun 58. [None but one beheld him dying] None but one beheld him dying Parting with the parting day Winds of evening sadly sighing Bore his soul from earth away 59. [Coldly bleakly drearily] Coldly bleakly drearily Evening died on Elbë's shore Winds were in the cloudy sky Sighing mourning ever more 60. [Old Hall of [Elbë] ruined lonely now] Old Hall of [Elbë] ruined lonely now House to which the voice of life shall never more return Chambers roofless desolate where weeds and ivy grow Windows through whose broken arches the night winds sadly mourn Home of the departed the long departed dead 61. Douglas's Ride Well, narrower draw the circle round And hush that organ's solemn sound And quench the lamp and stir the fire To rouse its flickering radiance higher; Loop up the window's velvet veil That we may hear the night-wind wail— For wild those gusts and well their chimes Blend with a song of troubled times— Song What rider up Gobelrin's glen Has spurred his straining steed, And fast and far from living men Has pressed with maddening speed? I saw his hoof-prints mark the rock When swift he left the plain I heard deep down, the echoing shock Re-echo back again. From cliff to cliff, through rock and heath That coal-black courser bounds; Nor heeds the river pent beneath, Nor marks how fierce it sounds. With streaming hair and forehead bare And mantle waving wide His master rides; the eagles there Soar up on every side: The goats fly by with timid cry Their realm so rashly won: They pause—he still ascends on high They gaze, but he is gone. O gallant horse hold on thy course! The road is tracked behind— Spur, rider, spur, or vain thy force Death comes on every wind. Roared thunder loud from that pitchy cloud? [From] it the torrents flow? Or woke the breeze in the swaying trees That frown so dark below? He breathes at last, when the valley is past; He rests on the grey rock's brow. What ails thee steed? At thy master's need, Wilt thou prove faithless now? No, hardly checked, with ears erect, The charger champed his rein, Ere his quivering limbs, all foam-beflecked, Were off like light again. Hark through the pass, with threatening crash Comes on the increasing roar! But what shall brave the deep, deep wave? The deadly path before? Their feet are dyed in a darker tide Who dare those dangers drear— Their breasts have burst through the battle's worst And why should they tremble here? Strong hearts they bear and arms as good To conquer or to fall They dash into the boiling flood, They gain the rock's steep wall— ‘Now my bold men this one pass more This narrow chasm of stone And Douglas—for our sovereign's gore Shall yield us back his own’— I hear their ever nearing tread Sound through the granite glen, There is a tall pine overhead Laid by the mountain men That dizzy bridge which no horse could track Has checked the outlaw's way; There like a wild beast he turns back And grimly stands at bay. Why smiles he so when far below He sees the toiling chase? The ponderous tree sways heavily And totters from its place— They raise their eyes for the sunny skies Are lost in sudden shade, But Douglas neither shrinks nor flies— He need not fly the dead— 62. [For him who struck thy foreign string] For him who struck thy foreign string I ween this heart hath ceased to care Then why dost thou such feelings bring To my sad spirit, old guitar? It is as if the warm sunlight In some deep glen should lingering stay When clouds of tempest and of night Had wrapped the parent orb away— It is as if the glassy brook Should image still its willows fair Though years ago the woodman's stroke Laid low in dust their gleaming hair: Even so, guitar, thy magic tone Hath moved the tear and waked the sigh Hath bid the ancient torrent flow Although its very source is dry! 63. [In dungeons dark I cannot sing] In dungeons dark I cannot sing In sorrow's thrall 'tis hard to smile What bird can soar with broken wing What heart can bleed and joy the while 64. [The evening sun was sinking down] The evening sun was sinking down On low green hills and clustered trees It was a scene as fair and lone As ever felt the soothing breeze That bends the grass when day is gone And gives the wave a brighter blue And makes the soft white clouds sail on Like spirits of ethereal dew Which all the morn had hovered o'er The azure flowers where they were nursed And now return to heaven once more Where their bright glories shone at first 65. [Fall leaves fall die flowers away] Fall leaves fall die flowers away Lengthen night and shorten day Every leaf speaks bliss to me Fluttering from the autumn tree I shall smile when wreaths of snow Blossom where the rose should grow I shall sing when night's decay Ushers in a drearier day 66. Song by Julius Brenzaida Geraldine, the moon is shining With so soft, so bright a ray, Seems it not that eve, declining Ushered in a fairer day? While the wind is whispering only, Far—across the water borne Let us, in this silence lonely Sit beneath the ancient thorn— Wild the road, and rough and dreary; Barren all the moorland round; Rude the couch that rests us weary; Mossy stone and heathy ground— But when winter storms were meeting In the moonless midnight dome Did we heed the tempest's beating Howling round our spirits' home? No, that tree, with branches riven Whitening in the whirl of snow, As it tossed against the heaven, Sheltered happy hearts below— And at Autumn's mild returning Shall our feet forget the way? And in Cynthia's silver morning, Geraldine, wilt thou delay? 67. Song by J. Brenzaida to G. S. I knew not 'twas so dire a crime To say the word, Adieu: But this shall be the only time My slighted heart shall sue. The wild moorside, the winter morn, The gnarled and ancient tree— If in your breast they waken scorn Shall wake the same in me. I can forget black eyes and brows And lips of rosy charm If you forget the sacred vows Those faithless lips could form— If hard commands can tame your love, Or prison walls can hold I would not wish to grieve above A thing so false and cold— And there are bosoms bound to mine With links both tried and strong; And there are eyes whose lightning shine Has warmed and blessed me long: Those eyes shall make my only day, Shall set my spirit free And chase the foolish thoughts away That mourn your memory! 68. [Where were ye all? and where wert thou] Where were ye all? and where wert thou I saw an eye that shone like thine But dark curls waved around his brow And his stern glance was strange to mine And yet a dreamlike comfort came Into my heart and anxious eye And trembling yet to hear his name I bent to listen watchfully His voice though never heard before Still spoke to me of years gone by It seemed a vision to restore That brought the hot tears to my eye 69. [I paused on the threshold I turned to the sky] I paused on the threshold I turned to the sky I looked on the heaven and the dark mountains round The full moon sailed bright through that Ocean on high And the wind murmured past with a wild eerie sound And I entered the walls of my dark prison-house Mysterious it rose from the billowy moor 70. [O come with me thus ran the song] O come with me thus ran the song The moon is bright in Autumn's sky And thou hast toiled and laboured long With aching head and weary eye 71. F. De Samara to A. G. A. Light up thy halls! 'Tis closing day; I'm drear and lone and far away— Cold blows on my breast, the north wind's bitter sigh And oh, my couch is bleak beneath the rainy sky! Light up thy halls—and think not of me; That face is absent now, thou hast hated so to see— Bright be thine eyes, undimmed their dazzling shine, For never, never more shall they encounter mine! The desert moor is dark; there is tempest in the air; I have breathed my only wish in one last, one burning prayer— A prayer that would come forth although it lingered long; That set on fire my heart, but froze upon my tongue— And now, it shall be done before the morning rise; I will not watch the sun ascend in yonder skies. One task alone remains—thy pictured face to view And then I go to prove if God, at least, be true! Do I not see thee now? Thy black resplendent hair; Thy glory-beaming brow, and smile how heavenly fair! Thine eyes are turned away—those eyes I would not see; Their dark, their deadly ray would more than madden me There, go, Deceiver, go! My hand is streaming wet, My heart's blood flows to buy the blessing—To forget! Oh could that lost heart give back, back again to thine One tenth part of the pain that clouds my dark decline! Oh could I see thy lids weighed down in cheerless woe; Too full to hide their tears, too stern to overflow; Oh could I know thy soul with equal grief was torn This fate might be endured—this anguish might be borne! How gloomy grows the Night! 'Tis Gondal's wind that blows I shall not tread again the deep glens where it rose— I feel it on my face—Where, wild blast, dost thou roam? What do we, wanderer, here, so far away from home? I do not need thy breath to cool my death-cold brow But go to that far land, where she is shining now; Tell Her my latest wish, tell Her my dreary doom; Say, that my pangs are past, but Hers are yet to come— Vain words—vain, frenzied thoughts! No ear can hear me call— Lost in the vacant air my frantic curses fall And could she see me now, perchance her lip would smile Would smile in careless pride and utter scorn the while! And yet, for all her hate, each parting glance would tell A stronger passion breathed, burned in this last farewell— Unconquered in my soul the Tyrant rules me still— Life bows to my control, but, Love I cannot kill! 72. [When days of Beauty deck the earth] When days of Beauty deck the earth Or stormy nights descend How well my spirit knows the path On which it ought to wend It seeks the consecrated spot Beloved in childhood's years The space between is all forgot Its sufferings and its tears 73. [Still beside that dreary water] Still beside that dreary water Stood he 'neath the cold moon ray Thinking on the deed of slaughter On his heart that darkly lay Soft the voice that broke his dreaming Stealing through the silent air Yet before the raven's screaming He had heard regardless there Once his name was sweetly uttered Then the echo died away But each pulse in horror uttered As the life would pass away 74. [There swept adown that dreary glen] There swept adown that dreary glen A wilder sound than mountain wind The thrilling shouts of fighting men With something sadder far behind The thrilling shouts they died away Before the night came greyly down But closed not with the closing day The choking sob the tortured moan Down in a hollow sunk in shade Where dark heath waved in secret gloom A weary bleeding form was laid Waiting the death that was to come 75. [O Dream, where art thou now?] O Dream, where art thou now? Long years have past away Since last, from off thine angel brow I saw the light decay— Alas, alas for me Thou wert so bright and fair, I could not think thy memory Would yield me nought but care! The sun-beam and the storm, The summer-eve divine, The silent night of solemn calm, The full moon's cloudless shine Were once entwined with thee But now, with weary pain— Lost vision! 'tis enough for me— Thou canst not shine again— 76. [Loud without the wind was roaring] Loud without the wind was roaring Through the waned Autumnal sky, Drenching wet, the cold rain pouring Spoke of stormy winters nigh. All too like that dreary eve Sighed within repining grief— Sighed at first—but sighed not long Sweet—How softly sweet it came! Wild words of an ancient song— Undefined, without a name— ‘It was spring, for the skylark was singing.’ Those words they awakened a spell— They unlocked a deep fountain whose springing Nor Absence nor Distance can quell. In the gloom of a cloudy November They uttered the music of May— They kindled the perishing ember Into fervour that could not decay Awaken on all my dear moorlands The wind in its glory and pride! O call me from valleys and highlands To walk by the hill-river's side! It is swelled with the first snowy weather; The rocks they are icy and hoar And darker waves round the long heather And the fern-leaves are sunny no more There are no yellow-stars on the mountain, The blue bells have long died away From the brink of the moss-bedded fountain, From the side of the wintery brae— But lovelier than corn-fields all waving In emerald and scarlet and gold Are the slopes where the north-wind is raving And the glens where I wandered of old— ‘It was morning; the bright sun was beaming.’ How sweetly that brought back to me The time when nor labour nor dreaming Broke the sleep of the happy and free But blithely we rose as the dusk heaven Was melting to amber and blue— And swift were the wings to our feet given While we traversed the meadows of dew. For the moors, for the moors where the short grass Like velvet beneath us should lie! For the moors, for the moors where each high pass Rose sunny against the clear sky! For the moors, where the linnet was trilling Its song on the old granite stone— Where the lark—the wild skylark was filling Every breast with delight like its own. What language can utter the feeling That rose when, in exile afar, On the brow of a lonely hill kneeling I saw the brown heath growing there. It was scattered and stunted, and told me That soon even that would be gone It whispered, ‘The grim walls enfold me I have bloomed in my last summer's sun’ But not the loved music whose waking Makes the soul of the Swiss die away Has a spell more adored and heart-breaking Than in its half-blighted bells lay— The spirit that bent 'neath its power How it longed, how it burned to be free! If I could have wept in that hour Those tears had been heaven to me— Well, well the sad minutes are moving Though loaded with trouble and pain— And sometime the loved and the loving Shall meet on the mountains again— 77. [A little while, a little while] A little while, a little while The noisy crowd are barred away; And I can sing and I can smile A little while I've holiday! Where wilt thou go my harassed heart? Full many a land invites thee now; And places near, and far apart Have rest for thee, my weary brow— There is a spot 'mid barren hills Where winter howls and driving rain But if the dreary tempest chills There is a light that warms again The house is old, the trees are bare And moonless bends the misty dome But what on earth is half so dear— So longed for as the hearth of home? The mute bird sitting on the stone, The dank moss dripping from the wall, The garden-walk with weeds o'ergrown I love them—how I love them all! Shall I go there? or shall I seek Another clime, another sky. Where tongues familiar music speak In accents dear to memory? Yes, as I mused, the naked room, The flickering firelight died away And from the midst of cheerless gloom I passed to bright, unclouded day— A little and a lone green lane That opened on a common wide A distant, dreamy, dim blue chain Of mountains circling every side— A heaven so clear, an earth so calm, So sweet, so soft, so hushed an air And, deepening still the dreamlike charm, Wild moor-sheep feeding everywhere— That was the scene—I knew it well I knew the pathways far and near That winding o'er each billowy swell Marked out the tracks of wandering deer Could I have lingered but an hour It well had paid a week of toil But truth has banished fancy's power I hear my dungeon bars recoil— Even as I stood with raptured eye Absorbed in bliss so deep and dear My hour of rest had fleeted by And given me back to weary care— 78. [How still, how happy! those are words] How still, how happy! those are words That once would scarce agree together I loved the plashing of the surge— The changing heaven the breezy weather, More than smooth seas and cloudless skies And solemn, soothing, softened airs That in the forest woke no sighs And from the green spray shook no tears How still, how happy! now I feel Where silence dwells is sweeter far Than laughing mirth's most joyous swell However pure its raptures are Come sit down on this sunny stone 'Tis wintery light o'er flowerless moors— But sit—for we are all alone And clear expand heaven's breathless shores I could think in the withered grass Spring's budding wreaths we might discern The violet's eye might shyly flash And young leaves shoot among the fern It is but thought—full many a night The snow shall clothe those hills afar And storms shall add a drearier blight And winds shall wage a wilder war Before the lark may herald in Fresh foliage twined with blossoms fair And summer days again begin Their glory-haloed crown to wear Yet my heart loves December's smile As much as July's golden beam Then let us sit and watch the while The blue ice curdling on the stream— 79. [The blue bell is the sweetest flower] The blue bell is the sweetest flower That waves in summer air Its blossoms have the mightiest power To soothe my spirit's care There is a spell in purple heath Too wildly, sadly drear The violet has a fragrant breath But fragrance will not cheer The trees are bare, the sun is cold And seldom, seldom seen— The heavens have lost their zone of gold The earth its robe of green And ice upon the glancing stream Has cast its sombre shade And distant hills and valleys seem In frozen mist arrayed— The blue bell cannot charm me now The heath has lost its bloom The violets in the glen below They yield no sweet perfume But though I mourn the heather-bell 'Tis better far, away I know how fast my tears would swell To see it smile today And that wood flower that hides so shy Beneath the mossy stone Its balmy scent and dewy eye 'Tis not for them I moan It is the slight and stately stem The blossom's silvery blue The buds hid like a sapphire gem In sheaths of emerald hue 'Tis these that breathe upon my heart A calm and softening spell That if it makes the tear-drop start Has power to soothe as well For these I weep, so long divided Through winter's dreary day In longing weep—but most when guided On withered banks to stray If chilly then the light should fall Adown the dreary sky And gild the dank and darkened wall With transient brilliancy How do I yearn, how do I pine For the time of flowers to come And turn me from that fading shine To mourn the fields of home— 80. [The night was dark yet winter breathed] The night was dark yet winter breathed With softened sighs on Gondal's shore And though its wind repining grieved It chained the snow swollen streams no more How deep into the wilderness My horse had strayed, I cannot say But neither morsel nor caress Would urge him farther on the way So loosening from his neck the rein I set my worn companion free And billowy hill and boundless plain Full soon divided him from me The sullen clouds lay all unbroken And blackening round the horizon drear But still they gave no certain token Of heavy rain or tempests near I paused confounded and distressed Down in the heath my limbs I threw Yet wilder as I longed for rest More wakeful heart and eyelids grew It was about the middle night And under such a starless dome When gliding from the mountain's height I saw a shadowy spirit come Her wavy hair on her shoulders bare It shone like soft clouds round the moon Her noiseless feet like melting sleet Gleamed white a moment then were gone ‘What seek you now on this bleak moor's brow Where wanders that form from heaven descending?’ It was thus I said as her graceful head The spirit above my couch was bending ‘This is my home where whirlwinds blow Where snowdrifts round my path are swelling 'Tis many a year 'tis long ago Since I beheld another dwelling ‘When thick and fast the smothering blast O'erwhelmed the hunter on the plain If my cheek grew pale in its loudest gale May I never tread the hills again ‘The shepherd had died on the mountainside But my ready aid was near him then I led him back o'er the hidden track And gave him to his native glen ‘When tempests roar on the lonely shore I light my beacon with sea-weeds dry And it flings its fire through the darkness dire And gladdens the sailor's hopeless eye ‘And the scattered sheep I love to keep Their timid forms to guard from harm I have a spell and they know it well And I save them with a powerful charm ‘Thy own good steed on his friendless bed A few hours since you left to die But I knelt by his side and the saddle untied And life returned to his glazing eye ‘And deem thou not that quite forgot My mercy will forsake me now I bring thee care and not Despair Abasement but not overthrow ‘To a silent home thy foot may come And years may follow of toilsome pain But yet I swear by that Burning Tear The loved shall meet on its hearth again’ 81. [From our evening fireside now] From our evening fireside now, Merry laugh and cheerful tone, Smiling eye and cloudless brow, Mirth and music all are flown: Yet the grass before the door Grows as green in April rain; And as blithely as of yore Larks have poured their day-long strain. Is it fear, or is it sorrow Checks the stagnant stream of joy? Do we tremble that tomorrow May our present peace destroy? For past misery are we weeping? What is past can hurt no more; And the gracious heavens are keeping Aid for that which lies before— One is absent, and for one Cheerless, chill is our hearthstone— One is absent, and for him Cheeks are pale and eyes are dim— Arthur, brother, Gondal's shore Rested from the battle's roar— Arthur, brother, we returned Back to Desmond lost and mourned: Thou didst purchase by thy fall Home for us and peace for all; Yet, how darkly dawned that day— Dreadful was the price to pay! Just as once, through sun and mist I have climbed the mountain's breast Still my gun with certain aim Brought to earth the fluttering game: But the very dogs repined, Though I called with whistle shrill Listlessly they lagged behind, Looking backward o'er the hill— Sorrow was not vocal there: Mute their pain and my despair But the joy of life was flown He was gone, and we were lone— So it is by morn and eve— So it is in field and hall— For the absent one we grieve, One being absent saddens All— 82. Song [King Julius left the south country] King Julius left the south country His banners all bravely flying His followers went out with Jubilee But they shall return with sighing Loud arose the triumphal hymn The drums were loudly rolling Yet you might have heard in distance dim How a passing bell was tolling The sword so bright from battles won With unseen rust is fretting The evening comes before the noon The scarce risen sun is setting While princes hang upon his breath And nations round are fearing Close by his side a daggered Death With sheathless point stands sneering That death he took a certain aim For Death is stony-hearted And in the zenith of his fame Both power and life departed— 83. Lines [The soft unclouded blue of air] The soft unclouded blue of air The earth as golden-green and fair And bright as Eden's used to be That air and earth have rested me Laid on the grass I lapsed away Sank back again to childhood's day All harsh thoughts perished memory mild Subdued both grief and passion wild But did the sunshine even now That bathed his stern and swarthy brow Oh did it wake I long to know One whisper one sweet dream in hi[m] One lingering joy that years ago Had faded—lost in distance di[m] That iron man was born like me And he was once an ardent boy He must have felt in infancy The glory of a summer sky Though storms untold his mind have tossed He cannot utterly have lost Remembrance of his early home So lost that not a gleam may come No vision of his mother's face When she so fondly would set free Her darling child from her embrace To roam till eve at liberty— Nor of his haunts nor of the flowers His tiny hand would grateful bear Returning from the darkening bowers To weave into her glossy hair I saw the light breeze kiss his cheek His fingers 'mid the roses twined I watched to mark one transient streak Of pensive softness shade his mind The open window showed around A glowing park and glorious sky And thick woods swelling with the sound Of Nature's mingled harmony Silent he sat. That stormy breast At length, I said has deigned to rest At length above that spirit flows The waveless ocean of repose Let me draw near 'twill soothe to view His dark eyes dimmed with holy dew Remorse even now may wake within And half unchain his soul from sin Perhaps this is the destined hour When hell shall lose its fatal power And heaven itself shall bend above To hail the soul redeemed by love Unmarked I gazed my idle thought Passed with the ray whose shine it caught One glance revealed how little care He felt for all the beauty there Oh crime can make the heart grow old Sooner than years of wearing woe Can turn the warmest bosom cold As winter wind or polar snow 84. To the Blue Bell Sacred watcher, wave thy bells! Fair hill flower and woodland child! Dear to me in deep green dells— Dearest on the mountains wild— Blue bell, even as all divine I have seen my darling shine— Blue bell, even as wan and frail I have seen my darling fail— Thou hast found a voice for me— And soothing words are breathed by thee— Thus they murmur, ‘Summer's sun Warms me till my life is done— Would I rather choose to die Under winter's ruthless sky? ‘Glad I bloom and calm I fade Weeping twilight dews my bed Mourner, mourner dry thy tears. Sorrow comes with lengthened years!’ 85. [I am the only being whose doom] I am the only being whose doom No tongue would ask no eye would mourn I never caused a thought of gloom A smile of joy since I was born In secret pleasure—secret tears This changeful life has slipped away As friendless after eighteen years As lone as on my natal day There have been times I cannot hide There have been times when this was drear When my sad soul forgot its pride And longed for one to love me here But those were in the early glow Of feelings not subdued by care And they have died so long ago I hardly now believe they were First melted off the hope of youth Then Fancy's rainbow fast withdrew And then experience told me truth In mortal bosoms never grew 'Twas grief enough to think mankind All hollow servile insincere— But worse to trust to my own mind And find the same corruption there 86. [May flowers are opening] May flowers are opening And leaves unfolding free There are bees in every blossom And birds on every tree The sun is gladly shining The stream sings merrily And I only am pining And all is dark to me O—cold cold is my heart It will not cannot rise It feels no sympathy With those refulgent skies Dead dead is my joy I long to be at rest I wish the damp earth covered This desolate breast If I were quite alone It might not be so drear When all hope was gone At least I could not fear But the glad eyes around me Must weep as mine have done And I must see the same gloom Eclipse their morning sun If heaven would rain on me That future storm of care So their fond hearts were free I'd be content to bear Alas as lightning withers The young and aged tree Both they and I shall fall beneath The fate we cannot flee 87. Lines by Claudia I did not sleep 'twas noon of day I saw the burning sunshine fall The long grass bending where I lay The blue sky brooding over all I heard the mellow hum of bees And singing birds and sighing trees And far away in woody dell The Music of the Sabbath bell I did not dream remembrance still Clasped round my heart its fetters chill But I am sure the soul is free To leave its clay a little while Or how in exile misery Could I have seen my country smile In English fields my limbs were laid With English turf beneath my head My spirit wandered o'er that shor[e] Where nought but it may wander more Yet if the soul can thus return I need not and I will not mourn And vainly did you drive me far With leagues of ocean stretched between My mortal flesh you might debar But not the eternal fire within My Monarch died to rule forever A heart that can forget him never And dear to me aye doubly dear Thought shut within the silent tomb His name shall be for whom I bear This long sustained and hopeless doom And brighter in the hour of woe Than in the blaze of victory's pride That glory shedding star shall glow For which we fought and bled and died 88. [I know not how it falls on me] I know not how it falls on me This summer evening, hushed and lone Yet the faint wind comes soothingly With something of an olden tone Forgive me if I've shunned so long Your gentle greeting earth and air But sorrow withers even the strong And who can fight against despair 89. Written on Returning to the P. of I. on the 10th of January 1827 The busy day has hurried by And hearts greet kindred hearts once more And swift the evening hours should fly But what turns every gleaming eye So often to the door? And then so quick away—and why Does sudden silence chill the room? And laughter sink into a sigh— And merry words to whispers die— And gladness change to gloom? O we are listening for a sound We know shall ne'er be heard again Sweet voices in the halls resound; Fair forms, fond faces gather round But all in vain—in vain! Their feet shall never waken more The echoes in these galleries wide, Nor dare the snow on the mountain's brow, Nor skim the river's frozen flow, Nor wander down its side— They who have been our life—our soul— Through summer-youth, from childhood's spring— Who bound us in one vigorous whole To stand 'gainst Tyranny's control For ever triumphing— Who bore the brunt of battle's fray The first to fight, the last to fall Whose mighty minds—with kindred ray Still led the van in Glory's way— The idol chiefs of all— They, they are gone! not for a while As golden suns at night decline And even in death our grief beguile Foretelling, with a rose-red smile How bright the morn will shine— No these dark towers are lone and lorn; This very crowd is vacancy; And we must watch and wait and mourn And half look out for their return; And think their forms we see— And fancy music in our ear Such as their lips could only pour And think we feel their presence near And start to find they are not here And never shall be more! 90. [Month after month year after year] Month after month year after year My harp has poured a dreary strain— At length a livelier note shall cheer And pleasure tune its chords again What though the stars and fair moonlight Are quenched in morning dull and grey They were but tokens of the night And this my soul is day 91. [And now the house dog stretched once more] And now the house dog stretched once more His limbs upon the glowing floor The children half resumed their play Though from the warm hearth scared away The goodwife left her spinning wheel And spread with smiles the evening meal The Shepherd placed a seat and pressed To their poor fare his unknown guest And he unclasped his mantle now And raised the covering from his brow Said ‘Voyagers by land and sea Were seldom feasted daintily’ And checked his host by adding stern He'd no refinement to unlearn A silence settled on the room The cheerful welcome sank to gloom But not those words though cold and high So froze their hospitable joy No—there was something in his face Some nameless thing they could not trace And something in his voice's tone Which turned their blood as chill as stone The ringlets of his long black hair Fell o'er a cheek most ghastly fair Youthful he seemed—but worn as they Who spend too soon their youthful day When his glance drooped 'twas hard to quell Unbidden feelings sudden swell And pity scarce her tears could hide So sweet that brow with all its pride But when upraised his eye would dart An icy shudder through the heart Compassion changed to horror then And fear to meet that gaze again It was not hatred's tiger glare Nor the wild anguish of despair It was not useless misery Which mocks at friendship's sympathy No—lightning all unearthly shone Deep in that dark eye's circling zone Such withering lightning as we deem None but a spectre's look may beam And glad they were when he turned away And wrapped him in his mantle grey Leant down his head upon his arm And veiled from view their basilisk charm 92. A Farewell to Alexandria I've seen this dell in July's shine As lovely as an angel's dream; Above, heaven's depth of blue divine; Around, the evening's golden beam— I've seen the purple heather-bell Look out by many a storm-worn stone And oh, I've known such music swell, Such wild notes wake these passes lone— So soft, yet so intensely felt, So low, yet so distinctly heard, My breath would pause, my eyes would melt And my tears dew the green heath-sward— I'd linger here a summer day Nor care how fast the hours flew by Nor mark the sun's departing ray Smile sadly glorious from the sky— Then, then I might have laid thee down And deemed thy sleep would gentle be I might have left thee, darling one And thought thy God was guarding thee! But now, there is no wandering glow No gleam to say that God is nigh: And coldly spreads thy couch of snow And harshly sounds thy lullaby. Forests of heather dark and long Wave their brown branching arms above And they must soothe thee with their song And they must shield my child of love! Alas the flakes are heavily falling They cover fast each guardian crest; And chilly white their shroud is palling Thy frozen limbs and freezing breast Wakes up the storm more madly wild The mountain drifts are tossed on high— Farewell unblessed, unfriended child, I cannot bear to watch thee die! 93. [Come hither child—who gifted thee] Come hither child—who gifted thee With power to touch that string so well? How daredst thou rouse up thoughts in me Thoughts that I would—but cannot quell? Nay chide not lady long ago I heard those notes in Ula's hall And had I known they'd waken woe I'd weep their music to recall But thus it was one festal night When I was hardly six years old I stole away from crowds and light And sought a chamber dark and cold I had no one to love me there I knew no comrade and no friend And so I went to sorrow where Heaven only heaven saw me bend Loud blew the wind 'twas sad to stay From all that splendour barred away I imaged in the lonely room A thousand forms of fearful gloom And with my wet eyes raised on high I prayed to God that I might die Suddenly in that silence drear A sound of music reached my ear And then a note I hear it yet So full of soul so deeply sweet I thought that Gabriel's self had come To take me to my father's home Three times it rose that seraph-strain Then died nor lived ever again But still the words and still the tone Swell round my heart when all alone 94. [Shed no tears o'er that tomb] Shed no tears o'er that tomb For there are Angels weeping Mourn not him whose doom Heaven itself is mourning Look how in sable gloom The clouds are earthward sweeping And earth receives them home Even darker clouds returning Is it when good men die That sorrow wakes above? Grieve saints when other spirits fly To swell their choir of love? Ah no with louder sound— The golden harp-strings quiver When good men gain the happy ground Where they must dwell forever But he who slumbers there: His bark will strive no more Across the waters of despair To reach that glorious shore The time of grace is past And mercy scorned and tried Forsakes to utter wrath at last The soul so steeled by pride That wrath will never spare Will never pity know Will mock its victim's maddened prayer Will triumph in his woe Shut from his Maker's smile The accursed man shall be Compassion reigns a little while Revenge eternally— 95. [Mild the mist upon the hill] Mild the mist upon the hill Telling not of storms tomorrow No the day has wept its fill Spent its store of silent sorrow Oh I'm gone back to the days of youth I am a child once more And 'neath my father's sheltering roof And near the old hall door I watch this cloudy evening fall After a day of rain Blue mists sweet mists of summer pall The horizon's mountain chain The damp stands in the long green grass As thick as morning's tears And dreamy scents of fragrance pass That breathe of other years 96. [How long will you remain? The midnight hour] How long will you remain? The midnight hour Has tolled the last note from [the] minster tower Come come the fire is dead the lamp burns low Your eyelids droop a weight is on your brow Your cold hands hardly hold the useless pen Come morn will give recovered strength again No let me linger leave me let me be A little longer in this reverie I'm happy now and would you tear away My blissful dream that never comes with day A vision dear though false for well my mind Knows what a bitter waking waits behind Can there be pleasure in this shadowy room With windows yawning on intenser gloom And such a dreary wind so bleakly sweeping Round walls where only you are vigil keeping Besides your face has not a sign of joy And more than tearful sorrow fills your eye Look on those woods look on that heaven lorn And think how changed they'll be tomorrow morn The dome of heaven expanding bright and blue The leaves the green grass sprinkled thick with dew And wet mists rising on the river's breast And wild birds bursting from their songless nest And your own children's merry voices chasing The fancies grief not pleasure has been tracing Aye speak of these—but can you tell me why Day breathes such beauty over earth and sky And waking sounds revive restore again [Dull] hearts that all night long have throbbed in pain Is it not that the sunshine and the wind Lure from its self the mourner's woe worn mind And all the joyous music breathing by And all the splendour of that cloudless sky Regive him shadowy gleams of infancy And draw his tired gaze from futurity 97. [The starry night shall tidings bring] The starry night shall tidings bring Go out upon the breezy moor Watch for a bird with sable wing And beak and talons dripping gore Look not around look not beneath But mutely trace its airy way Mark where it lights upon the heath Then wanderer kneel thee down and pray What fortune may await thee there I will not and I dare not tell But Heaven is moved by fervent prayer And God is mercy—fare thee well! 98. [It is not pride it is not shame] It is not pride it is not shame That makes her leave the gorgeous hall And though neglect her heart might tame She mourns not for her sudden fall 'Tis true she stands among the crowd An unmarked and an unloved child While each young comrade blithe and proud Glides through the maze of pleasure wild And all do homage to their will And all seem glad their voice to hear She heeds not that but hardly still Her eye can hold the quivering tear What made her weep what made her glide Out to the park this dreary day And cast her jewelled chains aside And seek a rough and lonely way And down beneath a cedar's shade On the wet grass regardless lie With nothing but its gloomy head Between her and the showery sky I saw her stand in the gallery long Watching the little children there As they were playing the pillars among And bounding down the marble stair 99. [It was night and on the mountains] It was night and on the mountains Fathoms deep the snow drifts lay Streams and waterfalls and fountains Down in darkness stole away Long ago the hopeless peasant Left his sheep all buried there Sheep that through the summer pleasant He had watched with fondest care Now no more a cheerful ranger Following pathways known of yore Sad he stood a wildered stranger On his own unbounded moor 100. [Fair sinks the summer evening now] Fair sinks the summer evening now In softened glory round my home; The sky upon its holy brow Wears not a cloud that speaks of gloom. The old tower, shrined in golden light, Looks down on the descending sun— So gently evening blends with night You scarce can say that day is done— And this is just the joyous hour When we were wont to burst away, To 'scape from labour's tyrant power And cheerfully go out to play— Then why is all so sad and lone? No merry foot-step on the stair— No laugh—no heart-awaking tone But voiceless silence everywhere— I've wandered round our garden-ground And still it seemed at every turn That I should greet approaching feet And words upon the breezes borne In vain—they will not come today And morning's beam will rise as drear Then tell me—are they gone for aye Our sun blinks through the mists of care? Ah no, reproving Hope doth say Departed joys 'tis fond to mourn When every storm that hides their ray Prepares a more divine return— 101. [Alcona in its changing mood] Alcona in its changing mood My soul will sometimes overfly The long long years of solitude That 'twixt our time of meeting lie Hope and despair in turns arise This doubting dreading heart to move And now 'mid smiles and bitter sighs Tell how I fear tell how I love And now I say ‘In Areon Hall’— (Alas that such a dream should come When well I know whate'er befall That Areon is no more my home.) Yet let me say ‘In Areon Hall’— The first faint red of morning shines And one right gladly to its call The restless breath of grief resigns Her faded eye, her pallid face Would woo the soft awaking wind All earth is breathing of the peace She long has sought but cannot find How sweet it is to watch the mist From that bright silent lake ascend And high o'er wood and mountain crest With heaven's grey clouds as greyly blend How sweet it is to mark those clouds Break brightly in the rising day To see the sober veil that shrouds This summer morning melt away O sweet to some but not to her Unm[ark]dst once at nature's shrine She now kneels down a worshipper A mad adorer, love, to thine The time is come when hope that long Revived and sank at length [is o'er] When faith in him however strong Dare prompt her to believe no more The tears which day by day o'erflowed Their heart deep source begin to freeze And as she gazes on the road That glances through those spreading trees No throbbing flutter checks her breath To mark a horseman hastening by Her haggard brow is calm as death And cold like death her dreary eye 102. Song [O between distress and pleasure] O between distress and pleasure Fond affection cannot be Wretched hearts in vain would treasure Friendship's joys when others flee Well I know thine eye would never Smile while mine grieved willingly Yet I know thine eye forever Could not weep in sympathy Let us part the time is over When I thought and felt like thee I will be an Ocean rover I will sail the desert sea Isles there are beyond its billow Lands where woe may wander free And beloved thy midnight pillow Will be soft unwatched by me Not on each returning morrow When thy heart bounds ardently Need'st thou then dissemble sorrow Marking my despondency Day by day some dreary token Will forsake thy memory Till at last all old links broken I shall be a dream to thee 103. [There was a time when my cheek burned] There was a time when my cheek burned To give such scornful fiends the lie Ungoverned nature madly spurned The law that bade it not defy O in the days of ardent youth I would have given my life for truth For truth, for right, for liberty I would have gladly, freely died And now I calmly hear and see The vain man smile the fool deride Though not because my heart is tame Though not for fear though not for shame My soul still chafes at every tone Of selfish and self-blinded error My breast still braves the world alone Steeled as it ever was to terror Only I know however I frown The same world will go rolling on 104. [The wind I hear it sighing] The wind I hear it sighing With Autumn's saddest sound— Withered leaves as thick are lying As spring-flowers on the ground— This dark night has won me To wander far away— Old feelings gather fast upon me Like vultures round their prey— Kind were they once, and cherished But cold and cheerless now— I would their lingering shades had perished When their light left my brow 'Tis like old age pretending The softness of a child, My altered, hardened spirit bending To meet their fancies wild Yet could I with past pleasures, Past woe's oblivion buy— That by the death of my dearest treasures My deadliest pains might die. O then another daybreak Might haply dawn above— Another summer gild my cheek, My soul, another love— 106. [The wind was rough which tore] The wind was rough which tore That leaf from its parent tree The fate was cruel which bore The withering corpse to me We wander on we have no rest It is a dreary way What shadow is it That ever moves before [my] eyes It has a brow of ghostly whiteness 107. [That wind I used to hear it swelling] That wind I used to hear it swelling With joy divinely deep You might have seen my hot tears welling But rapture made me weep I used to love on winter nights To lie and dream alone Of all the hopes and real delights My early years had known And oh above the rest of those That coming time should [bear] Like heaven's own glorious stars they rose Still beaming bright and fair 108. [Come, walk with me] Come, walk with me, There's only thee To bless my spirit now— We used to love on winter nights To wander through the snow; Can we not woo back old delights? The clouds rush dark and wild They fleck with shade our mountain heights The same as long ago And on the horizon rest at last In looming masses piled; While moonbeams flash and fly so fast We scarce can say they smiled— Come walk with me, come walk with me; We were not once so few But Death has stolen our company As sunshine steals the dew— He took them one by one and we Are left the only two; So closer would my feelings twine Because they have no stay but thine— ‘Nay call me not—it may not be Is human love so true? Can Friendship's flower droop on for years And then revive anew? No, though the soil be wet with tears, How fair soe'er it grew The vital sap once perished Will never flow again And surer than that dwelling dread, The narrow dungeon of the dead Time parts the hearts of men—’ 109. [Heaven's glory shone where he was laid] Heaven's glory shone where he was laid In life's decline I turned me from that young saint's bed To gaze on thine— It was a summer day that saw His spirit's flight Thine parted in a time of awe A winter-night 110. [Upon her soothing breast] Upon her soothing breast She lulled her little child A winter sunset in the west A dreary glory smiled 111. [I gazed within thine earnest eyes] I gazed within thine earnest eyes And read the sorrow brooding there [I saw] thy young breast heave with sighs And envied such despair Go to the grave in youth's [first] woe That doom was written long ago 112. Written in the Gaaldine Prison Caves to A. G. A. Thy sun is near meridian height And my sun sinks in endless night But if that night bring only sleep Then I shall rest, while thou wilt weep. And say not, that my early tomb Will give me to a darker doom— Shall these long, agonizing years Be punished by eternal tears? No, that I feel can never be; A God of hate could hardly bear To watch, through all eternity, His own creation's dread despair! The pangs that wring my mortal breast Must claim from Justice, lasting rest: Enough, that this departing breath Will pass in anguish worse than death. If I have sinned, long, long ago That sin was purified by woe— I've suffered on through night and day; I've trod a dark and frightful way. Earth's wilderness was round me spread Heaven's tempests beat my naked head— I did not kneel: in vain would prayer Have sought one gleam of mercy there! How could I ask for pitying love When that grim concave frowned above Hoarding its lightnings to destroy My only and my priceless joy? They struck and long may Eden shine Ere I would call its glories mine All Heaven's undreamt felicity Could never blot the past from me— No, years may cloud and death may sever But what is done is done for ever— And thou false friend, and treacherous guide, Go sate thy cruel heart with pride— Go, load my memory with shame; Speak but to curse my hated name; My tortured limbs in dungeons bind And spare my life to kill my mind— Leave me in chains and darkness now And when my very soul is worn; When reason's light has left my brow And madness cannot feel thy scorn; Then come again—thou wilt not shrink; I know thy soul is free from fear The last full cup of triumph drink, Before the blank of death be there— Thy raving, dying victim see; Lost, cursed, degraded—all for thee! Gaze on the wretch—recall to mind His golden days left long behind. Does memory sleep in Lethean rest? Or wakes its whisper in thy breast? O memory, wake! Let scenes return That even her haughty heart must mourn! Reveal, where o'er a lone green wood The moon of summer pours Far down from heaven, its silver flood On deep Elderno's shores— There, lingering in the wild embrace Youth's warm affections gave She sits, and fondly seems to trace His features in the wave— And while, on that reflected face Her eyes intently dwell: ‘Fernando, sing tonight,’ she says, ‘The lays I love so well.’ He smiles and sings, though every air Betrays the faith of yesterday: His soul is glad to cast for her Virtue and faith and Heaven away. Well, thou hast paid me back my love! But, if there be a God above Whose arm is strong, whose word is true This hell shall wring thy spirit too! 113. [Far, far away is mirth withdrawn] Far, far away is mirth withdrawn; 'Tis three long hours before the morn And I watch lonely, drearily— So come thou shade commune with me Deserted one! thy corpse lies cold And mingled with a foreign mould— Year after year the grass grows green Above the dust where thou hast been. I will not name thy blighted name Tarnished by unforgotten shame Though not because my bosom torn Joins the mad world in all its scorn— Thy phantom face is dark with woe Tears have left ghastly traces there, Those ceaseless tears! I wish their flow Could quench thy wild despair. They deluge my heart like the rain On cursed Gomorrah's howling plain— Yet when I hear thy foes deride I must cling closely to thy side— Our mutual foes—they will not rest From trampling on thy buried breast— Glutting their hatred with the doom They picture thine, beyond the tomb— But God is not like human kind Man cannot read the Almighty mind Vengeance will never torture thee Nor hunt thy soul eternally Then do not in this night of grief This time of overwhelming fear O do not think that God can leave Forget, forsake, refuse to hear!— What have I dreamt? He lies asleep With whom my heart would vainly weep He rests—and I endure the woe That left his spirit long ago— 114. [It is too late to call thee now—] It is too late to call thee now— I will not nurse that dream again For every joy that lit my brow Would bring its after-storm of pain— Besides the mist is half withdrawn, The barren mountain-side lies bare And sunshine and awaking morn Paint no more golden visions there— Yet ever in my grateful breast Thy darling shade shall cherished be For God alone doth know how blest My early years have been in thee! 116. [If grief for grief can touch thee] If grief for grief can touch thee, If answering woe for woe, If any ruth can melt thee Come to me now! I cannot be more lonely, More drear I cannot be! My worn heart throbs so wildly 'Twill break for thee— And when the world despises— When heaven repels my prayer— Will not mine angel comfort? Mine idol hear? Yes by the tears I've poured, By all my hours of pain O I shall surely win thee Beloved, again! 117. ['Tis moonlight summer moonlight] 'Tis moonlight summer moonlight All soft and still and fair The solemn hour of midnight Breathes sweet thoughts everywhere But most where trees are sending Their breezy boughs on high Or stooping low are lending A shelter from the sky And there in those wild bowers A lovely form is laid Green grass and dew steeped flowers Wave gently round her head 118. The Night-Wind In summer's mellow midnight A cloudless moon shone through Our open parlour window And rosetrees wet with dew I sat in silent musing— The soft wind waved my hair It told me Heaven was glorious And sleeping Earth was fair— I needed not its breathing To bring such thoughts to me But still it whispered lowly ‘How dark the woods will be!— ‘The thick leaves in my murmur Are rustling like a dream, And all their myriad voices Instinct with spirit seem’ I said, ‘Go gentle singer, Thy wooing voice is kind But do not think its music Has power to reach my mind— ‘Play with the scented flower, The young tree's supple bough— And leave my human feelings In their own course to flow’ The Wanderer would not leave me Its kiss grew warmer still— ‘O come,’ it sighed so sweetly ‘I'll win thee 'gainst thy will— ‘Have we not been from childhood friends? Have I not loved thee long? As long as thou hast loved the night Whose silence wakes my song? ‘And when thy heart is laid at rest Beneath the church-yard stone I shall have time enough to mourn And thou to be alone’— 119. [Companions, all day long we've stood] Companions, all day long we've stood The wild winds restless blowing All day we've watched the darkened flood Around our vessel flowing Sunshine has never smiled since morn And clouds have gathered drear And heavier hearts would feel forlorn And weaker minds would fear But look in each young shipmate's eyes Lit by the evening flame And see how little stormy skies Our joyous blood can tame No glance the same expression wears No lip the same soft smile Yet kindness warms and courage cheers Nerves every breast the while It is the hour of dreaming now The red fire brightly gleams And sweetest in a red fire's glow The hour of dreaming seems I may not trace the thoughts of all But some I read as well As I can hear the ocean's fall And sullen surging swell Edmund's swift soul is gone before It threads a forest wide Whose towers are bending to the shore And gazing on the tide And one is there—I know the voice The thrilling stirring tone That makes his bounding pulse rejoice Yet makes not his alone Mine own hand longs to clasp her hand Mine eye to greet her eye Win white sails, win Zedora's strand And Ula's Eden sky— Mary and Flora oft their gaze Is clouded pensively And what that earnest aspect says Is all revealed to me 'Tis but two years or little more Since first they dared that main And such a night may well restore That first time back again The smothered sigh the lingering late The longed for dreaded hour The parting at the moss-grown gate The last look on the tower I know they think of these and then The evening's gathering gloom And they alone with foreign men To guard their cabin room 120. [And like myself lone wholly lone] And like myself lone wholly lone It sees the day's long sunshine glow And like myself it makes its moan In unexhausted woe Give we the hills our equal prayer Earth's breezy hills and heaven's blue sea We ask for nothing further here But our own hearts and liberty Ah could my hand unlock its chain How gladly would I watch it soar And ne'er regret and ne'er complain To see its shining eyes no more But let me think that if today It pines in cold captivity Tomorrow both shall soar away Eternally entirely Free 122. [Shall Earth no more inspire thee] Shall Earth no more inspire thee, Thou lonely dreamer now? Since passion may not fire thee Shall Nature cease to bow? Thy mind is ever moving In regions dark to thee; Recall its useless roving— Come back and dwell with me— I know my mountain breezes Enchant and soothe thee still— I know my sunshine pleases Despite thy wayward will— When day with evening blending Sinks from the summer sky, I've seen thy spirit bending In fond idolatry— I've watched thee every hour— I know my mighty sway— I know my magic power To drive thy griefs away— Few hearts to mortals given On earth so wildly pine Yet none would ask a Heaven More like this Earth than thine— Then let my winds caress thee— Thy comrade let me be— Since nought beside can bless thee Return and dwell with me— 123. [Aye there it is! It wakes tonight] Aye there it is! It wakes tonight Sweet thoughts that will not die And feeling's fires flash all as bright As in the years gone by!— And I can tell by thine altered cheek And by thy kindled gaze And by the words thou scarce dost speak, How wildly fancy plays— Yes I could swear that glorious wind Has swept the world aside Has dashed its memory from thy mind Like foam-bells from the tide— And thou art now a spirit pouring Thy presence into all— The essence of the Tempest's roaring And of the Tempest's fall— A universal influence From Thine own influence free— A principle of life intense Lost to mortality— Thus truly when that breast is cold Thy prisoned soul shall rise The dungeon mingle with the mould— The captive with the skies— 124. [I see around me tombstones grey] I see around me tombstones grey Stretching their shadow far away. Beneath the turf my footsteps tread Lie low and lone the silent dead— Beneath the turf—beneath the mould— Forever dark, forever cold— And my eyes cannot hold the tears That memory hoards from vanished years For Time and Death and Mortal pain Give wounds that will not heal again— Let me remember half the woe I've seen and heard and felt below And heaven itself—so pure and blest Could never give my spirit rest— Sweet land of light! thy children fair Know nought akin to our despair— Nor have they felt, nor can they tell What tenants haunt each mortal cell What gloomy guests we hold within— Torments and madness, tears and sin! Well—may they live in ecstasy Their long eternity of joy; At least we would not bring them down With us to weep, with us to groan, No—Earth would wish no other sphere To taste her cup of sufferings drear; She turns from Heaven a careless eye And only mourns that we must die! Ah mother, what shall comfort thee In all this boundless misery? To cheer our eager eyes a while We see thee smile, how fondly smile! But who reads not through that tender glow Thy deep, unutterable woe? Indeed no dazzling land above Can cheat thee of thy children's love— We all in life's departing shine Our last dear longings blend with thine; And struggle still, and strive to trace With clouded gaze thy darling face We would not leave our native home For any world beyond the Tomb No—rather on thy kindly breast Let us be laid in lasting rest Or waken but to share with thee A mutual immortality— 125. Geraldine 'Twas night, her comrades gathered all Within their city's rocky wall; When flowers were closed and day was o'er Their joyous hearts awoke the more But lonely in her distant cave She heard the river's restless wave Chafing its banks with dreamy flow Music for mirth, and wail for woe— Palm trees and cedars towering high Deepened the gloom of evening's sky And thick did raven ringlets veil Her forehead, drooped like lily pale Yet I could hear my lady sing; I knew she did not mourn, For never yet from sorrow's spring Such witching notes were born Thus poured she in that cavern wild The voice of feelings warm As, bending o'er her beauteous child She clasped its sleeping form— ‘Why sank so soon the summer sun From our Zedora's skies? I was not tired, my darling one, Of gazing in thine eyes— ‘Methought the heaven whence thou hast come Was lingering there awhile And Earth seemed such an alien home They did not dare to smile. ‘Methought each moment something strange Within their circles shone And yet, through every magic change They were Brenzaida's own. ‘Methought—what thought I not, sweet love? My whole heart centred there; I breathed not but to send above One gush of ardent prayer. ‘Bless it, my gracious God, I cried, Preserve thy mortal shrine For thine own sake, be thou its guide And keep it still divine! ‘Say, sin shall never blanch that cheek Nor suffering charge that brow Speak, in thy mercy maker, speak And seal it safe from woe! ‘Why did I doubt? In God's control Our mutual fates remain And pure as now, my angel's soul Must go to heaven again!’ The revellers in the city slept My lady, in her woodland bed; I, watching o'er her slumber wept As one who mourns the dead! 126. Rosina Weeks of wild delirium past— Weeks of fevered pain, Rest from suffering comes at last— Reason dawns again— It was a pleasant April day Declining to the afternoon Sunshine upon her pillow lay As warm as middle June. It told her how unconsciously Early spring had hurried by ‘Ah Time has not delayed for me!’ She murmured with a sigh. ‘Angora's hills have heard their tread The crimson flag is planted there— Elderno's waves are rolling red, While I lie fettered here? ‘Nay, rather, Gondal's shaken throne Is now secure and free; And my King Julius reigns alone, Debtless, alas! to me!’ Loud was the sudden gush of woe From those who watched around; Rosina turned, and sought to know Why burst that boding sound. ‘What then, my dreams are false,’ she said ‘Come maidens, answer me Has Almedore in battle fled? Have slaves subdued the free? ‘I know it all, he could not bear To leave me dying far away— He fondly, madly lingered here And we have lost the day! ‘But check those coward sobs, and bring My robes and smooth my tangled hair: A noble victory you shall sing For every hour's despair! ‘When will he come? 'Twill soon be night— He'll come when evening falls— Oh I shall weary for the light To leave my lonely halls!’ She turned her pallid face aside As she would seek repose; But dark Ambition's thwarted pride Forbade her lids to close— And still on all who waited by Oppressive mystery hung; And swollen with grief was every eye And chained was every tongue. They whispered nought, but, ‘Lady, sleep, Dear Lady, slumber now! Had we not bitter cause to weep While you were laid so low? ‘And Hope can hardly deck the cheek With sudden signs of cheer When it has worn through many a week The stamp of anguish drear’— Fierce grew Rosina's gloomy gaze; She cried, ‘Dissemblers, own, Exina's arms in victory blaze Brenzaida's crest is down’ ‘Well, since it must be told, Lady, Brenzaida's crest is down Brenzaida's sun is set, Lady, His empire overthrown! ‘He died beneath this palace dome— True hearts on every side— Among his guards, within his home Our glorious monarch died ‘I saw him fall, I saw the gore From his heart's fountain swell And mingling on the marble floor His murderer's life-blood fell— ‘And now, 'mid northern mountains lone His desert grave is made; And, Lady, of your love, alone Remains a mortal shade!’ 127. A. S. to G. S. I do not weep, I would not weep; Our Mother needs no tears: Dry thine eyes too, 'tis vain to keep This causeless grief for years What though her brow be changed and cold, Her sweet eyes closed for ever? What though the stone—the darksome mould Our mortal bodies sever? What though her hand smooth ne'er again Those silken locks of thine— Nor through long hours of future pain Her kind face o'er thee shine? Remember still she is not dead She sees us Gerald now Laid where her angel spirit fled 'Mid heath and frozen snow And from that world of heavenly light Will she not always bend To guide us in our lifetime's night And guard us to the end? Thou know'st she will, and well may'st mourn That we are left below But not that she can ne'er return To share our earthly woe— 128. H. A. and A. S. In the same place, when Nature wore The same celestial glow; I'm sure I've seen those forms before But many springs ago; And only he had locks of light And she had raven hair, While now, his curls are dark as night And hers, as morning fair. Besides, I've dreamt of tears whose traces Will never more depart Of agony that fast effaces The verdure of the heart— I dreamt one sunny day like this In this peerless month of May I saw her give the unanswered kiss As his spirit passed away: Those young eyes that so sweetly shine Then looked their last adieu And pale Death changed that cheek divine To his unchanging hue And earth was cast above the breast That beats so warm and free Where her soft ringlets lightly rest And move responsively Then she, upon the covered grave— The grass grown grave, did lie— A tomb not girt by Gondal's wave Nor arched by Gondal's sky. The sod was sparkling bright with dew But brighter still with tears That welled from mortal grief, I knew Which never heals with years— And if he came not for her woe He would not now return; He would not leave his sleep below When she had ceased to mourn— O Innocence, that cannot live With heart-wrung anguish long Dear childhood's Innocence, forgive, For I have done thee wrong! The bright rosebuds, those hawthorns shroud Within their perfumed bower Have never closed beneath a cloud Nor bent before a shower— Had darkness once obscured their sun Or kind dew turned to rain No storm-cleared sky that ever shone Could win such bliss again— 129. Written in Aspin Castle How do I love on summer nights To sit within this Norman door Whose sombre portal hides the lights Thickening above me evermore! How do I love to hear the flow Of Aspin's water murmuring low And hours long listen to the breeze That sighs in Rockden's waving trees Tonight, there is no wind to wake One ripple on the lonely lake— Tonight the clouds subdued and grey Starlight and moonlight shut away 'Tis calm and still and almost drear So utter is the solitude; But still I love to linger here And form my mood to nature's mood— There's a wild walk beneath the rocks Following the bend of Aspin's side 'Tis worn by feet of mountain-flocks That wander down to drink the tide Never by cliff and gnarled tree Wound fairy path so sweet to me Yet of the native shepherds none In open day and cheerful sun Will tread its labyrinths alone Far less when evening's pensive hour Hushes the bird and shuts the flower And gives to Fancy magic power O'er each familiar tone. For round their hearths they'll tell the tale And every listener swears it true How wanders there a phantom pale With spirit-eyes of dreamy blue— It always walks with head declined Its long curls move not in the wind Its face is fair—divinely fair; But brooding on that angel brow Rests such a shade of deep despair As nought divine could ever know How oft in twilight lingering lone I've stood to watch that phantom rise And seen in mist and moonlit stone Its gleaming hair and solemn eyes The ancient men in secret say 'Tis the first chief of Aspin grey That haunts his feudal home But why, around that alien grave Three thousand miles beyond the wave— Where his exiled ashes lie Under the cope of England's sky— Doth he not rather roam? I've seen his picture in the hall; It hangs upon an eastern wall And often when the sun declines That pictures like an angel shines— And when the moonbeam chill and blue Streams the spectral windows through That picture's like a spectre too— The hall is full of portraits rare; Beauty and mystery mingle there— At his right hand an infant fair Looks from its golden frame— And just like his its ringlets bright Its large dark eye of shadowy light Its cheek's pure hue, its forehead white And like its noble name— Daughter divine! and could his gaze Fall coldly on thy peerless face? And did he never smile to see Himself restored to infancy? Never part back that golden flow Of curls, and kiss that pearly brow And feel no other earthly bliss Was equal to that parent's kiss? No; turn towards the western side There stands Sidonia's deity! In all her glory, all her pride! And truly like a god she seems Some god of wild enthusiast's dreams And this is she for whom he died! For whom his spirit unforgiven, Wanders unsheltered shut from heaven An outcast for eternity— Those eyes are dust—those lips are clay— That form is mouldered all away Nor thought, nor sense, nor pulse, nor breath The whole devoured and lost in death! There is no worm, however mean, That living, is not nobler now Than she—Lord Alfred's idol queen So loved—so worshipped long ago— O come away! the Norman door Is silvered with a sudden shine— Come leave these dreams o'er things of yore And turn to Nature's face divine— O'er wood and wold, o'er flood and fell O'er flashing lake and gleaming dell The harvest moon looks down And when heaven smiles with love and light And earth looks back so dazzling bright In such a scene, on such a night Earth's children should not frown— 131. On the Fall of Zalona All blue and bright, in glorious light The morn comes marching on And now Zalona's steeples white Glow golden in the sun— This day might be a festal day; The streets are crowded all, And emerald flags stream broad and gay From turret, tower and wall; And hark! how music, evermore Is sounding in the sky: The deep bells boom—the cannon roar, The trumpets sound on high— The deep bells boom, the deep bells clash Upon the reeling air: The cannon, with unceasing crash Make answer far and near— What do those brazen tongues proclaim? What joyous fête begun— What offering to our country's fame— What noble victory won? Go, ask that solitary sire Laid in his house alone; His silent hearth without a fire— His sons and daughters gone— Go, ask those children, in the street Beside their mother's door; Waiting to hear the lingering feet That they shall hear no more. Ask those pale soldiers round the gates With famine-kindled eye— They'll say, ‘Zalona celebrates The day that she must die!’ The charger, by his manger tied Has rested many a day; Yet ere the spur have touched his side, Behold, he sinks away! And hungry dogs, with wolf-like cry Unburied corpses tear, While their gaunt masters gaze and sigh And scarce the feast forbear— Now, look down from Zalona's wall— There war the unwearied foe: If ranks before our cannon fall, New ranks, forever, grow— And many a week, unbroken thus, Their troops, our ramparts hem; And for each man that fights for us A hundred fight for them! Courage and Right and spotless Truth Were pitched 'gainst traitorous crime We offered all—our age, our youth— Our brave men in their prime— And all have failed! the fervent prayers, The trust in heavenly aid, Valour and faith and sealed tears That would not mourn the dead— Lips, that did breathe no murmuring word; Hearts, that did ne'er complain Though vengeance held a sheathed sword And martyrs bled in vain— Alas, alas, the Myrtle bowers By blighting blasts destroyed! Alas, the Lily's withered flowers That leave the garden void! Unfolds o'er tower, and waves o'er height, A sheet of crimson sheen— Is it the setting sun's red light That stains our standard green? Heaven help us in this awful hour! For now might Faith decay— Now might we doubt God's guardian power And curse, instead of pray— He will not even let us die— Not let us die at home; The foe must see our soldiers fly As they had feared the Tomb: Because, we dare not stay to gain Those longed for, glorious graves— We dare not shrink from slavery's chain To leave our children slaves! But when this scene of awful woe Has neared its final close As God forsook our armies, so May He forsake our foes! 133. To A. S. 1830 Where beams the sun the brightest In the noons of sweet July? Where falls the snow the lightest From bleak December's sky? Where can the weary lay his head And lay it safe the while In a grave that never shuts its dead From heaven's benignant smile? Upon the earth in sunlight Spring grass grows green and fair But beneath the earth is midnight— Eternal midnight there! Then why lament that those we love Escape Earth's dungeon Tomb? As if the flowers that blow above Could charm its undergloom— From morning's faintest dawning Till evening's deepest shade Thou wilt not cease thy mourning To know where she is laid; But if to weep above her grave Be such a priceless boon Go, shed thy tears in Ocean's wave And they will reach it soon. Yet midst thy wild repining Mad though that anguish be Think heaven on her is shining Even as it shines on thee— With thy mind's vision pierce the Deep Look how she rests below And tell me why such blessed sleep Should cause such bitter woe? 134. E. G. to M. R. Thy Guardians are asleep So I've come to bid thee rise; Thou hast a holy vow to keep Ere yon crescent quit the skies: Though clouds careering wide Will hardly let her gleam She's bright enough to be our guide Across the mountain-stream— O waken, Dearest, wake! What means this long delay? Say, wilt thou not for honour's sake Chase idle fears away? Think not of future grief Entailed on present joy: An age of woe were only brief Its memory to destroy— And neither Hell nor Heaven Though both conspire at last Can take the bliss that has been given— Can rob us of the past— Then, waken, Mary, wake How canst thou linger now? For true love's and Gleneden's sake Arise and keep thy vow! 135. [Had there been falsehood in my breast] Had there been falsehood in my breast No thorns had marred my road This spirit had not lost its rest These tears had never flowed 136. To A. G. A. ‘Thou standest in the greenwood now The place, the hour, the same— And here the fresh leaves gleam and glow And there, down in the lake below The tiny ripples flame— ‘The breeze sings like a summer breeze Should sing in summer skies And tower-like rocks and tent-like trees In mingled glory rise. ‘But where is he today, today?’ ‘O question not with me’— ‘I will not, Lady, only say Where may thy lover be? ‘Is he upon some distant shore? Or is he on the sea? Or is the heart thou dost adore, A faithless heart to thee?’ ‘The heart I love, whate'er betide, Is faithful as the grave And neither foreign lands divide Nor yet the rolling wave.’ ‘Then why should sorrow cloud that brow, And tears those eyes bedim? Reply this once, is it that thou Hast faithless been to him?’ ‘I gazed upon the cloudless moon And loved her all the night Till morning came and ardent noon Then I forgot her light— ‘No—not forgot, eternally Remains its memory dear; But could the day seem dark to me Because the night was fair? ‘I well may mourn that only one Can light my future sky Even though by such a radiant sun My moon of life must die’— 137. [Yes holy be thy resting place] Yes holy be thy resting place Wherever thou may'st lie The sweetest winds breathe on thy face The softest of the sky And will not guardian Angels send Kind dreams and thoughts of love Though I no more may watchful bend Thy [longed] repose above? And will not heaven itself bestow A beam of glory there That summer's grass more green may grow And summer's flowers more fair? Farewell farewell 'tis hard to part Yet loved one it must be I would not rend another heart Not even by blessing thee Go we must break affection's chain Forget the hopes of years Nay [grieve] not willest thou remain To waken wilder tears This [herald] breeze with thee and me Roved in the dawning day And thou shouldest be where it shall be Ere evening far away 138. A. G. A. to A. S. At such a time, in such a spot The world seems made of light Our blissful hearts remember not How surely follows night— I cannot, Alfred, dream of aught That casts a shade of woe; That heaven is reigning in my thought Which wood and wave and earth have caught From skies that overflow— That heaven which my sweet lover's brow Has won me to adore— Which from his blue eyes beaming now Reflects a still intenser glow Than nature's heaven can pour— I know our souls are all divine I know that when we die What seems the vilest, even like thine A part of God himself shall shine In perfect purity— But coldly breaks November's day Its changes charmless all Unmarked, unloved, they pass away We do not wish one hour to stay Nor sigh at evening's fall And glorious is the gladsome rise Of June's rejoicing morn And who with unregretful eyes Can watch the lustre leave its skies To twilight's shade forlorn? Then art thou not my golden June, All mist and tempest free? As shines earth's sun in summer noon So heaven's sun shines in thee— Let others seek its beams divine In cell and cloister drear But I have found a fairer shrine And happier worship here— By dismal rites they win their bliss By penance, fasts, and fears— I have one rite—a gentle kiss— One penance—tender tears— O could it thus forever be That I might so adore I'd ask for all eternity To make a paradise for me, My love—and nothing more! 139. [In the earth, the earth thou shalt be laid] In the earth, the earth thou shalt be laid A grey stone standing over thee; Black mould beneath thee spread And black mould to cover thee— ‘Well, there is rest there So fast come thy prophecy— The time when my sunny hair Shall with grass roots twined be’ But cold, cold is that resting place Shut out from Joy and Liberty And all who loved thy living face Will shrink from its gloom and thee ‘Not so, here the world is chill And sworn friends fall from me But there, they'll own me still And prize my memory’ Farewell, then, all that love All that deep sympathy: Sleep on, heaven laughs above— Earth never misses thee— Turf-sod and tombstone drear Part human company One heart broke, only, there That heart was worthy thee!— 140. Rodric Lesley. 1830 Lie down and rest, the fight is done Thy comrades to the camp retire; Gaze not so earnestly upon The far gleam of the beacon fire. Listen not to the wind-borne sounds Of music and of soldiers' cheer; Thou canst not go—unnumbered wounds Exhaust thy life and hold thee here— Had that hand power to raise the sword Which since this morn laid hundreds low Had that tongue strength to speak the word That urged thy followers on the foe Were that warm blood within thy veins Which now upon the earth is flowing Splashing its sod with crimson stains Reddening the pale heath round thee growing— Then Rodric, thou might'st still be turning With eager eye and anxious breast To where those signal-lights are burning— To where thy monarch's legions rest— But never more—Look up and see The twilight fading from the skies That last dim beam that sets for thee, Rodric, for thee shall never rise! 142. M. G. for the U. S. 'Twas yesterday at early dawn I watched the falling snow; A drearier scene on winter morn Was never stretched below. I could not see the mountains round But I knew by the wild wind's roar How every drift, in their glens profound Was deepening ever more— And then I thought of Ula's bowers Beyond the southern sea Her tropic prairies bright with flowers And rivers wandering free— I thought of many a happy day Spent in her Eden isle With my dear comrades, young and gay All scattered now so far away But not forgot the while! Who that has breathed that heavenly air To northern climes would come To Gondal's mists and moorlands drear And sleet and frozen gloom? Spring brings the swallow and the lark But what will winter bring? Its twilight noons and evenings dark To match the gifts of spring? No, Look with me o'er that sullen main If thy spirit's eye can see There are brave ships floating back again That no calm southern port could chain From Gondal's stormy sea. O how the hearts of the voyagers beat To feel the frost-wind blow! What flower in Ula's gardens sweet Is worth one flake of snow? The blast which almost rends their sail Is welcome as a friend; It brings them home, that thundering gale Home to their journey's end: Home to our souls whose wearying sighs Lament their absence drear And feel how bright even winter skies Would shine if they were here! 143. At Castle Wood The day is done—the winter sun Is setting in its sullen sky And drear the course that [h]as been run And dim the hearts that slowly die No star will light my coming night No morn of hope for me will shine I mourn not heaven would blast my sight And I never longed for [ways] divine Through Life['s] hard Task I did not ask Celestial aid celestial cheer I saw my fate [without its] mask And met it too without a tear The grief that pressed this [living] breast Was heavier far than earth can be And who would dread eternal rest When labour's hire was agony Dark falls the fear of this despair On spirits born for happiness But I was bred the mate of care The foster child of [sore] distress No sighs for me, no sympathy, No wish to keep my soul below The heart is dead since infancy Unwept for let the body go 145. A. G. A. to A. S. This summer wind, with thee and me Roams in the dawn of day; But thou must be where it shall be, Ere Evening—far away. The farewell's echo from thy soul Should not depart before Hills rise and distant rivers roll Between us evermore— I know that I have done thee wrong— Have wronged both thee and Heaven— And I may mourn my lifetime long Yet may not be forgiven— Repentant tears will vainly fall To cancel deeds untrue; But for no grief can I recall The dreary word—Adieu— Yet thou a future peace shalt win Because thy soul is clear; And I who had the heart to sin Will find a heart to bear— Till far beyond earth's frenzied strife That makes destruction joy Thy perished faith shall spring to life And my remorse shall die 147. E. W. to A. G. A. How few, of all the hearts that loved, Are grieving for thee now! And why should mine, tonight, be moved With such a sense of woe? Too often, thus, when left alone Where none my thoughts can see, Comes back a word, a passing tone From thy strange history. Sometimes I seem to see thee rise A glorious child again— All virtues beaming from thine eyes That ever honoured men— Courage and Truth, a generous breast Where Love and Gladness lay; A being whose very Memory blest And made the mourner gay— O, fairly spread thy early sail And fresh and pure and free Was the first impulse of the gale That urged life's wave for thee! Why did the pilot, too confiding Dream o'er that Ocean's foam? And trust in Pleasure's careless guiding To bring his vessel home? For, well, he knew what dangers frowned, What mists would gather dim, What rocks and shelves and sands lay round Between his port and him— The very brightness of the sun, The splendour of the main, The wind that bore him wildly on Should not have warned in vain An anxious gazer from the shore, I marked the whitening wave And wept above thy fate the more Because I could not save— It recks not now, when all is over, But, yet my heart will be A mourner still, though friend and lover Have both forgotten thee! 148. The Death of A. G. A. Were they shepherds, who sat all day On that brown mountain-side? But neither staff nor dog had they; Nor woolly flock to guide— They were clothed in savage attire; Their locks were dark and long; And at each belt a weapon dire Like bandit-knives was hung— One was a woman tall and fair; A princess she might be From her stately form and her features rare And her look of majesty— But oh, she had a sullen frown— A lip of cruel scorn— As sweet tears never melted down Her cheeks since she was born! 'Twas well she had no sceptre to wield, No subject land to sway; Fear might have made her vassals yield But Love had been far away— Yet, Love was even at her feet In his most burning mood— That Love which will the Wicked greet As kindly as the Good— And he was noble too, who bowed So humbly by her side— Entreating, till his eyes o'erflowed, Her spirit's icy pride— ‘Angelica, from my very birth I have been nursed in strife, And lived upon this weary Earth A wanderer, all my life; ‘The baited tiger could not be So much athirst for gore, For men and laws have tortured me Till I can bear no more— ‘The guiltless blood upon my hands Will shut me out from Heaven And here, and even in foreign lands I cannot find a haven— ‘And in all space, and in all time, And through Eternity, To aid a Spirit lost in crime, I have no hope but thee— ‘Yet will I swear, No saint on high A truer faith could prove— No angel, from that holy sky, Could give thee purer love! ‘For thee, through never ending years I'd suffer endless pain; But only give me back my tears Return my love again!’ Many a time, unheeded, thus The reckless man would pray; But something woke an answering flush On his lady's brow today, And her eye flashed flame, as she turned to speak, In concord with her reddening cheek— ‘I've known a hundred kinds of love— All made the loved one rue; And what is thine, that it should prove, Than other love, more true? ‘Listen, I've known a burning heart To which my own was given Nay, not in passion; do not start— Our love was love from heaven: At least, if heavenly love be born In the pure light of childhood's morn Long ere the poison-tainted air From this world's plague-fen rises there: ‘That heart was like a tropic sun That kindles all it shines upon; And never Magian devotee Gave worship half so warm as I And never radiant bow could be So welcome in a stormy sky My soul dwelt with her day and night She was my all sufficing light— My childhood's mate, my girlhood's guide My only blessing, only pride ‘But cursed be the very earth That gave that fiend her fatal birth! With her own hand she bent the bow That laid my best affections low— Then mocked my grief and scorned my prayers And drowned my bloom of youth in tears— Warnings, reproaches, both were vain; What recked she of another's pain? My dearer self she would not spare— From Honour's voice she turned his ear: First made her love his only stay; Then snatched the treacherous prop away! Douglas, he pleaded bitterly— He pleaded as you plead to me, For life-long chains or timeless tomb Or any, but an Exile's doom— We both were scorned—both sternly driven To shelter 'neath a foreign heaven; And darkens o'er that dreary time A wildering dream of frenzied crime— I will not now those days recall; The oath within that caverned hall And its fulfilment, those you know: We both together struck the blow: But—you can never know the pain That my lost heart did then sustain When, severed wide by guiltless gore, I felt that one could love no more! Back maddening thought!—the grave is deep Where my Amedeus lies asleep, And I have long forgot to weep— ‘Now hear me, in these regions wild I saw today my enemy Unarmed, as helpless as a child She slumbered on a sunny lea; Two friends—no other guard had she; And they were wandering on the braes; And chasing in regardless glee, The wild goat o'er his dangerous ways— My hand was raised—my knife was bare; With stealthy tread I stole along But a wild bird sprang from his hidden lair And woke her with a sudden song: Yet moved she not; she only raised Her lids and on the bright sun gazed And uttered such a dreary sigh I thought just then she should not die Since living was such misery— Now Douglas, for our hunted band— For future joy and former woe Assist me, with thy heart and hand To send to hell my mortal foe— Her friends fall first, that she may drain A deeper cup of bitterer pain; Yonder they stand and watch the waves Dash in among the echoing caves— Their farewell sight of earth and sea; Come, Douglas, rise and go with me’— The lark sang clearly overhead And sweetly hummed the Bee And softly, round their dying bed, The wind blew from the sea— Fair Surry would have raised her eyes To see that water shine; To see once more in mountain skies The summer sun decline: But ever, on her fading cheek, The languid lid would close As weary that such light should break Its much-desired repose— And she was waning fast away— Even Memory's voice grew dim; Her former life's eventful day Had dwindled to a dream: And hardly could her mind recall One thought of joy or pain; That cloud was gathering over all Which never clears again! In vain—in vain, you need not gaze Upon those features now! That sinking head you need not raise, Nor kiss that pulseless brow— Let out the grief that chokes your breath; Lord Lesley, set it free: The sternest eye, for such a death Might fill with sympathy. The tresses o'er her bosom spread Were by a faint breeze blown; ‘Her heart is beating,’ Lesley said; ‘She is not really gone!’ And still that form he fondly pressed, And still of hope he dreamed Nor marked how from his own young breast Life's crimson current streamed— At last, the sunshine left the ground, The laden bee flew home, The deep down sea, with sadder sound Impelled its waves to foam; And the corpse grew heavy on his arm, The starry heaven grew dim, The summer night so mild and warm Felt wintery chill to him. A troubled shadow, o'er his eye Came down, and rested there; The moors and sky went swimming by Confused and strange and drear He faintly prayed, ‘Oh, Death, delay Thy last fell dart to throw Till I can hear my Sovereign say, The traitors' heads are low! ‘God, guard her life, since not to me That dearest boon was given; God, bless her arm with victory Or bless not me with heaven!’ Then came the cry of agony; The pang of parting pain; And he had overpassed the sea That none can pass again. Douglas leaned above the well; Heather banks around him rose; Bright and warm the sunshine fell On that spot of sweet repose— With the blue heaven bending o'er And the soft wind singing by And the clear stream, evermore Mingling harmony— On the shady side reclined, He watched its waters play And sound and sight had well combined To banish gloom away— A voice spoke near—‘She'll come,’ it said ‘And Douglas, thou shalt be My love, although the very dead Should rise to rival thee! ‘Now, only let thine arm be true And nerved, like mine, to kill; And Gondal's royal race shall rue This day on Elmor Hill!’ They wait not long, the rustling heath Betrays their royal foe; With hurried step and panting breath And cheek almost as white as death, Augusta sprang below— Yet marked she not where Douglas lay She only saw the well; The tiny fountain, churning spray Within its mossy cell— ‘Oh, I have wrongs to pay,’ she cried, ‘Give life, give vigour now!’ And, stooping by the water's side, She drank its crystal flow. And brightly, with that draught, came back The glory of her matchless eye As, glancing o'er the moorland track, She shook her head impatiently— Nor shape, nor shade—the mountain flocks Quietly feed in grassy dells; Nor sound, except the distant rocks Echoing to their bells. She turns—she meets the Murderer's gaze: Her own is scorched with a sudden blaze— The blood streams down her brow; The blood streams through her coal-black hair— She strikes it off with little care; She scarcely feels it flow, For she has marked and known him too And his own heart's ensanguined dew Must slake her vengeance now! False friend! no tongue save thine can tell The mortal strife that then befell: But, ere night darkened down The stream in silence sang once more And, on its green bank, bathed in gore Augusta lay alone! False Love! no earthly eye did see, Yet Heaven's pure eye regarded thee Where thy own Douglas bled— How thou didst turn in mockery From his last hopeless agony And leave the hungry hawk to be Sole watcher of the dead! Was it a deadly swoon? Or was her spirit really gone? And the cold corpse, beneath the moon Laid like another mass of dust and stone? The moon was full that night The sky was almost like the day: You might have seen the pulse's play Upon her forehead white; You might have seen the dear, dear sign of life In her uncovered eye And her cheek changing in the mortal strife Betwixt the pain to live and agony to die. But nothing mutable was there! The face, all deadly fair, Showed a fixed impress of keen suffering past, And the raised lid did show No wandering gleam below But a stark anguish, self-destroyed at last— Long he gazed and held his breath, Kneeling on the blood-stained heath; Long he gazed those lids beneath Looking into Death! Not a word from his followers fell, They stood by, mute and pale; That black treason uttered well Its own heart-harrowing tale— But earth was bathed in other gore: There were crimson drops across the moor And Lord Eldred, glancing round Saw those tokens on the ground: ‘Bring him back!’ he hoarsely said, ‘Wounded is the traitor fled— Vengeance may hold but minutes brief And you have all your lives for grief—’ He is left alone—he sees the stars Their quiet course continuing And, far away, down Elmor scars He hears the stream its waters fling: That lulling monotone did sing Of broken rock and shaggy glen, Of welcome for the moorcock's wing, But, not of wail for men! Nothing in heaven or earth to show One sign of sympathizing woe— And nothing but that agony In her now unconscious eye To weigh upon the labouring breast And prove she did not pass at rest— But he who watched, in thought had gone Retracing back her lifetime flown; Like sudden ghosts, to memory came Full many a face, and many a name, Full many a heart, that in the tomb He almost deemed might have throbbed again Had they but known her dreary doom, Had they but seen their idol there, A wreck of desolate despair, Left to the wild birds of the air And mountain winds and rain! For him—no tear his stern eye shed As he looked down upon the dead— ‘Wild morn’—he thought—‘and doubtful noon; But yet it was a glorious sun Though comet-like its course was run: That sun should never have been given To burn and dazzle in the heaven Or night has quenched it far too soon! And thou art gone—with all thy pride, Thou, so adored, so deified! Cold as the earth, unweeting now Of love, or joy, or mortal woe— ‘For what thou wert, I would not grieve, But much, for what thou wert to be— That life, so stormy and so brief, That death, has wronged us more than thee! Thy passionate youth was nearly past The opening sea seemed smooth at last Yet vainly flowed the calmer wave Since fate had not decreed to save— And vain too must the sorrow be Of those who live to mourn for thee; But Gondal's foes shall not complain That thy dear blood was poured in vain!’ 151. D. G. C. to J. A. Come, the wind may never again Blow as now it blows for us And the stars may never again, shine as now they shine; Long before October returns Seas of blood will have parted us And you must crush the love in your heart And I, the love in mine! For face to face will our kindred stand And as they are so we shall be Forgetting how the same sweet earth has borne and nourished all— One must fight for the people's power And one for the rights of royalty And each be ready to give his life to work the other's fall— The chance of war we cannot shun Nor would we shrink from our fathers' cause Nor dread Death more because the hand that gives it may be dear We must bear to see Ambition rule Over Love, with his iron laws; Must yield our blood for a stranger's sake and refuse ourselves a tear! So, the wind may never again Blow as now it blows for us And the stars may never again shine as now they shine Next October, the cannon's roar From hostile ranks may be urging us— Me to strike for your life's blood and you to strike for mine— 154. From a Dungeon Wall in the Southern College ‘Listen! when your hair like mine Takes a tint of silver grey, When your eyes, with dimmer shine, Watch life's bubbles float away, ‘When you, young man, have borne like me The weary weight of sixty-three Then shall penance sore be paid For these hours so wildly squandered And the words that now fall dead On your ears be deeply pondered Pondered and approved at last But their virtue will be past! ‘Glorious is the prize of Duty Though she be a serious power Treacherous all the lures of Beauty Thorny bud and poisonous flower! ‘Mirth is but a mad beguiling Of the golden gifted Time— Love—a demon meteor wiling Heedless feet to gulfs of crime. ‘Those who follow earthly pleasure Heavenly Knowledge will not lead Wisdom hides from them her treasure, Virtue bids them evil speed! ‘Vainly may their hearts, repenting, Seek for aid in future years— Wisdom scorned knows no relenting— Virtue is not won by tears ‘Fain would we your steps reclaim Waken fear and holy shame And to this end, our council well And kindly doomed you to a cell Whose darkness, may perchance, disclose A beacon-guide from sterner woes’— So spake my judge—then seized his lamp And left me in the dungeon damp, A vault-like place whose stagnant air Suggests and nourishes despair! Rosina, this had never been Except for you, my despot queen! Except for you the billowy sea Would now be tossing under me The wind's wild voice my bosom thrill And my glad heart bound wilder still Flying before the rapid gale Those wondrous southern isles to hail Which wait for my companions free But thank your passion—not for me! You know too well—and so do I Your haughty beauty's sovereignty Yet have I read those falcon eyes— Have dived into their mysteries— Have studied long their glance and feel It is not love those eyes reveal— They Flash—they burn with lightning shine But not with such fond fire as mine; The tender star fades faint and wan Before Ambition's scorching sun— So deem I now—and Time will prove If I have wronged Rosina's love— 161. [A thousand sounds of happiness] A thousand sounds of happiness And only one of real distress; One hardly uttered groan— But that has hushed all vocal joy, Eclipsed the glory of the sky And made me think that misery Rules in our world alone! About his face the sunshine glows And in his hair the south wind blows And violet and wild wood-rose Are sweetly breathing near Nothing without suggests dismay If he could force his mind away From tracking farther day by day The desert of Despair— Too truly agonized to weep His eyes are motionless as sleep, His frequent sighs long-drawn and deep Are anguish to my ear And I would soothe but can I call The cold corpse from its funeral pall And cause a gleam of hope to fall With my consoling tear? O Death, so many spirits driven Through this false world, their all had given To win the everlasting haven To sufferers so divine— Why didst thou smite the loved the blest The ardent and the happy breast That full of hope desired not rest And shrank appalled from thine? At least, since thou wilt not restore In mercy launch one arrow more Life's conscious Death it wearies sore It tortures worse than thee— Enough of storms have bowed his head, Grant him at last a quiet bed Beside his early stricken Dead Even where he yearns to be! 162. A. E. and R. C. Heavy hangs the raindrop From the burdened spray; Heavy broods the damp mist On Uplands far away; Heavy looms the dull sky, Heavy rolls the sea— And heavy beats the young heart Beneath that lonely tree— Never has a blue streak Cleft the clouds since morn— Never has his grim Fate Smiled since he was born— Frowning on the infant, Shadowing childhood's joy, Guardian angel knows not That melancholy boy— Day is passing swiftly Its sad and sombre prime; Youth is fast invading Sterner manhood's time— All the flowers are praying For sun before they close And he prays too, unknowing, That sunless human rose! Blossoms, that the west wind Has never wooed to blow Scentless are your petals Your dew as cold as snow. Soul, where kindred kindness No early promise woke Barren is your beauty As weed upon the rock— Wither, Brothers, wither, You were vainly given— Earth reserves no blessing For the unblessed of Heaven! Child of Delight! with sunbright hair And seablue seadeep eyes Spirit of Bliss, what brings thee here Beneath these sullen skies? Thou shouldest live in eternal spring Where endless day is never dim Why, seraph, has thy erring wing Borne thee down to weep with him? ‘Ah, not from heaven am I descended And I do not come to mingle tears But sweet is day, though with shadows blended And though clouded, sweet are youthful years— ‘I, the image of light and gladness Saw and pitied that mournful boy And I swore to take his gloomy sadness And give to him my beamy joy— ‘Heavy and dark the night is closing Heavy and dark may its biding be Better for all from grief reposing And better for all who watch like me— ‘Guardian angel, he lacks no longer; Evil fortune he need not fear: Fate is strong but Love is stronger And more unsleeping than angel's care’— 164. M. A. Written on the Dungeon Wall—N. C. I know that tonight, the wind is sighing, The soft August wind, over forest and moor While I in a grave-like chill am lying On the damp black flags of my dungeon-floor— I know that the Harvest Moon is shining; She neither will wax nor wane for me, Yet I weary, weary, with vain repining, One gleam of her heaven-bright face to see! For this constant darkness is wasting the gladness Fast wasting the gladness of life away; It gathers up thoughts akin to madness That never would cloud the world of day I chide with my soul—I bid it cherish The feelings it lived on when I was free, But, shrinking it murmurs, ‘Let Memory perish Forget for thy Friends have forgotten thee!’ Alas, I did think that they were weeping Such tears as I weep—it is not so! Their careless young eyes are closed in sleeping; Their brows are unshadowed, undimmed by woe— Might I go to their beds, I'd rouse that slumber, My spirit should startle their rest, and tell How hour after hour, I wakefully number Deep buried from light in my lonely cell! Yet let them dream on, though dreary dreaming Would haunt my pillow if they were here And I were laid warmly under the gleaming Of that guardian moon and her comrade star— Better that I my own fate mourning Should pine alone in the prison-gloom Than waken free on the summer morning And feel they were suffering this awful doom 165. Julian M. and A. G. Rochelle Silent is the House—all are laid asleep; One, alone, looks out o'er the snow-wreaths deep; Watching every cloud, dreading every breeze That whirls the wildering drifts and bends the groaning trees— Cheerful is the hearth, soft the matted floor Not one shivering gust creeps through pane or door The little lamp burns straight; its rays shoot strong and far I trim it well to be the Wanderer's guiding-star— Frown, my haughty sire, chide my angry Dame; Set your slaves to spy, threaten me with shame; But neither sire nor dame, nor prying serf shall know What angel nightly tracks that waste of winter snow— In the dungeon crypts idly did I stray Reckless of the lives wasting there away; ‘Draw the ponderous bars, open Warder stern!’ He dare not say me nay—the hinges harshly turn— ‘Our guests are darkly lodged’ I whispered gazing through The vault whose grated eye showed heaven more grey than blue; (This was when glad spring laughed in awaking pride.) ‘Aye, darkly lodged enough!’ returned my sullen guide— Then, God forgive my youth, forgive my careless tongue! I scoffed as the chill chains on the damp flagstones rung; ‘Confined in triple walls, art thou so much to fear, That we must bind thee down and clench thy fetters here?’ The captive raised her face; it was as soft and mild As sculptured marble saint or slumbering, unweaned child It was so soft and mild, it was so sweet and fair Pain could not trace a line nor grief a shadow there! The captive raised her hand and pressed it to her brow ‘I have been struck,’ she said, ‘and I am suffering now Yet these are little worth, your bolts and irons strong And were they forged in steel they could not hold me long’— Hoarse laughed the jailer grim ‘Shall I be won to hear Dost think fond, dreaming wretch, that I shall grant thy prayer? Or better still, wilt melt my master's heart with groans? Ah sooner might the sun thaw down these granite stones!— ‘My master's voice is low, his aspect bland and kind But hard as hardest flint the soul that lurks behind: And I am rough and rude, yet, not more rough to see Than is the hidden ghost which has its home in me!’ About her lips there played a smile of almost scorn ‘My friend,’ she gently said, ‘you have not heard me mourn When you my parents' lives—my lost life, can restore Then may I weep and sue, but, never, Friend, before!’ Her head sank on her hands, its fair curls swept the ground The dungeon seemed to swim in strange confusion round— ‘Is she so near to death?’ I murmured, half aloud And kneeling, parted back the floating golden cloud Alas, how former days upon my heart were borne How memory mirrored then the prisoner's joyous morn Too blithe, too loving Child, too warmly, wildly gay! Was that the wintry close of thy celestial May? She knew me and she sighed ‘Lord Julian, can it be, Of all my playmates, you, alone, remember me? Nay start not at my words, unless you deem it shame To own from conquered foe, a once familiar name— ‘I cannot wonder now at aught the world will do And insult and contempt I lightly brook from you, Since those, who vowed away their souls to win my love Around this living grave like utter strangers move! ‘Nor has one voice been raised to plead that I might die Not buried under earth but in the open sky By ball or speedy knife or headsman's skilful blow— A quick and welcome pang instead of lingering woe! ‘Yet, tell them, Julian, all, I am not doomed to wear Year after year in gloom and desolate despair; A messenger of Hope comes every night to me And offers, for short life, eternal liberty. ‘He comes with western winds, with evening's wandering airs, With that clear dusk of heaven that brings the thickest stars; Winds take a pensive tone, and stars a tender fire And visions rise and change which kill me with desire— ‘Desire for nothing known in my maturer years When joy grew mad with awe at counting future tears; When, if my spirit's sky was full of flashes warm, I knew not whence they came from sun or thunderstorm; ‘But first a hush of peace, a soundless calm descends; The struggle of distress and fierce impatience ends; Mute music soothes my breast—unuttered harmony That I could never dream till earth was lost to me. ‘Then dawns the Invisible, the Unseen its truth reveals; My outward sense is gone, my inward essence feels— Its wings are almost free, its home, its harbour found; Measuring the gulf it stoops and dares the final bound! ‘Oh, dreadful is the check—intense the agony When the ear begins to hear and the eye begins to see; When the pulse begins to throb, the brain to think again, The soul to feel the flesh and the flesh to feel the chain! ‘Yet I would lose no sting, would wish no torture less; The more that anguish racks the earlier it will bless; And robed in fires of Hell, or bright with heavenly shine, If it but herald Death, the vision is divine’— She ceased to speak and I, unanswering watched her there Not daring now to touch one lock of silken hair— As I had knelt in scorn, on the dank floor I knelt still— My fingers in the links of that iron hard and chill— I heard and yet heard not the surly keeper growl; I saw, yet did not see, the flagstone damp and foul; The keeper, to and fro, paced by the bolted door And shivered as he walked and as he shivered, swore— While my cheek glowed in flame, I marked that he did rave Of air that froze his blood and moisture like the grave— ‘We have been two hours good!’ he muttered peevishly, Then, loosing off his belt the rusty dungeon key, He said, ‘You may be pleased, Lord Julian, still to stay But duty will not let me linger here all day; If I might go, I'd leave this badge of mine with you Not doubting that you'd prove a jailer stern and true’ I took the proffered charge; the captive's drooping lid Beneath its shady lash a sudden lightning hid Earth's hope was not so dead heaven's home was not so dear I read it in that flash of longing quelled by fear Then like a tender child whose hand did just enfold Safe in its eager grasp a bird it wept to hold When pierced with one wild glance from the troubled hazel eye It gushes into tears and lets its treasure fly Thus ruth and selfish love together striving tore The heart all newly taught to pity and adore; If I should break the chain, I felt my bird would go Yet I must break the chain or seal the prisoner's woe— Short strife what rest could soothe—what peace could visit me While she lay pining there for Death to set her free? ‘Rochelle, the dungeons teem with foes to gorge our hate— Thou art too young to die by such a bitter fate!’ With hurried blow on blow I struck the fetters through Regardless how that deed my after hours might rue Oh, I was over-blest by the warm unasked embrace By the smile of grateful joy that lit her angel face! And I was over-blest—aye, more than I could dream When, faint, she turned aside from noon's unwonted beam; When though the cage was wide—the heaven around it lay— Its pinion would not waft my wounded dove away— Through thirteen anxious weeks of terror-blent delight I guarded her by day and guarded her by night While foes were prowling near and Death gazed greedily And only Hope remained a faithful friend to me— Then oft with taunting smile, I heard my kindred tell ‘How Julian loved his hearth and sheltering roof-tree well; How the trumpet's voice might call the battle-standard wave But Julian had no heart to fill a patriot's grave.’ And I, who am so quick to answer sneer with sneer; So ready to condemn to scorn a coward's fear I held my peace like one whose conscience keeps him dumb And saw my kinsmen go—and lingered still at home. Another hand than mine, my rightful banner held And gathered my renown on Freedom's crimson field Yet I had no desire the glorious prize to gain— It needed braver nerve to face the world's disdain— And by the patient strength that could that world defy; By suffering with calm mind, contempt and calumny; By never-doubting love, unswerving constancy, Rochelle, I earned at last an equal love from thee! 167. [No coward soul is mine] No coward soul is mine No trembler in the world's storm-troubled sphere I see Heaven's glories shine And Faith shines equal arming me from Fear O God within my breast Almighty ever-present Deity Life, that in me hast rest As I Undying Life, have power in thee Vain are the thousand creeds That move men's hearts, unutterably vain, Worthless as withered weeds Or idlest froth amid the boundless main To waken doubt in one Holding so fast by thy infinity So surely anchored on The steadfast rock of Immortality With wide-embracing love Thy spirit animates eternal years Pervades and broods above, Changes, sustains, dissolves, creates and rears Though Earth and moon were gone And suns and universes ceased to be And thou wert left alone Every Existence would exist in thee There is not room for Death Nor atom that his might could render void Since thou art Being and Breath And what thou art may never be destroyed 168. [Why ask to know the date—the clime?] Why ask to know the date—the clime? More than mere words they cannot be: Men knelt to God and worshipped crime, And crushed the helpless even as we— But, they had learnt, from length of strife— Of civil war and anarchy To laugh at death and look on life With somewhat lighter sympathy. It was the autumn of the year, The time to labouring peasants, dear: Week after week, from noon to noon, September shone as bright as June— Still, never hand a sickle held; The crops were garnered in the field— Trod out and ground by horses' feet While every ear was milky sweet; And kneaded on the threshing-floor With mire of tears and human gore. Some said they thought that heaven's pure rain Would hardly bless those fields again: Not so—the all-benignant skies Rebuked that fear of famished eyes— July passed on with showers and dew, And August glowed in showerless blue; No harvest time could be more fair Had harvest fruits but ripened there. And I confess that hate of rest, And thirst for things abandoned now, Had weaned me from my country's breast And brought me to that land of woe. Enthusiast—in a name delighting, My alien sword I drew to free One race, beneath two standards fighting, For Loyalty, and Liberty— When kindred strive, God help the weak! A brother's ruth 'tis vain to seek: At first, it hurt my chivalry To join them in their cruelty; But I grew hard—I learnt to wear An iron front to terror's prayer; I learnt to turn my ears away From torture's groans, as well as they. By force I learnt—what power had I To say the conquered should not die? What heart, one trembling foe to save When hundreds daily filled the grave? Yet, there were faces that could move A moment's flash of human love; And there were fates that made me feel I was not to the centre, steel— I've often witnessed wise men fear To meet distress which they foresaw; And seeming cowards nobly bear A doom that thrilled the brave with awe; Strange proofs I've seen, how hearts could hide Their secret with a life-long pride, And then reveal it as they died— Strange courage, and strange weakness too, In that last hour when most are true, And timid natures strangely nerved To deeds from which the desperate swerved. These I may tell, but leave them now. Go with me where my thoughts would go; Now all today and all last night I've had one scene before my sight— Wood-shadowed dales; a harvest moon Unclouded in its glorious noon; A solemn landscape, wide and still; A red fire on a distant hill— A line of fires, and deep below, Another dusker, drearier glow— Charred beams, and lime, and blackened stones Self-piled in cairns o'er burning bones, And lurid flames that licked the wood Then quenched their glare in pools of blood— But yestereve—No! never care; Let street and suburb smoulder there— Smoke-hidden, in the winding glen, They lay too far to vex my ken. Four score shot down—all veterans strong— One prisoner spared, their leader young— And he within his house was laid, Wounded, and weak and nearly dead. We gave him life against his will; For he entreated us to kill— But statue-like we saw his tears— And harshly fell our captain's sneers! ‘Now, heaven forbid!’ with scorn he said— ‘That noble gore our hands should shed Like common blood—retain thy breath Or scheme, if thou canst purchase death— When men are poor we sometimes hear And pitying grant that dastard prayer; When men are rich, we make them buy The pleasant privilege, to die— O, we have castles reared for kings Embattled towers and buttressed wings Thrice three feet thick, and guarded well With chain, and bolt, and sentinel! We build our despots' dwellings sure; Knowing they love to live secure— And our respect for royalty Extends to thy estate and thee!’ The suppliant groaned; his moistened eye Swam wild and dim with agony— The gentle blood could ill sustain Degrading taunts, unhonoured pain. Bold had he shown himself to lead; Eager to smite and proud to bleed— A man amid the battle's storm; An infant in the after calm. Beyond the town his mansion stood Girt round with pasture-land and wood; And there our wounded soldiers lying Enjoyed the ease of wealth in dying: For him, no mortal more than he Had softened life with luxury; And truly did our priest declare ‘Of good things he had had his share.’ We lodged him in an empty place, The full moon beaming on his face Through shivered glass, and ruins, made Where shell and ball the fiercest played. I watched his ghastly couch beside Regardless if he lived or died— Nay, muttering curses on the breast Whose ceaseless moans denied me rest: 'Twas hard, I know, 'twas harsh to say, ‘Hell snatch thy worthless soul away!’ But then 'twas hard my lids to keep Through this long night, estranged from sleep. Captive and keeper, both outworn, Each in his misery yearned for morn; Even though returning morn should bring Intenser toil and suffering. Slow, slow it came! Our dreary room Grew drearier with departing gloom; Yet as the west wind warmly blew I felt my pulses bound anew, And turned to him—nor breeze, nor ray Revived that mould of shattered clay, Scarce conscious of his pain he lay— Scarce conscious that my hands removed The glittering toys his lightness loved— The jewelled rings, and locket fair Where rival curls of silken hair, Sable and brown revealed to me A tale of doubtful constancy. ‘Forsake the world without regret,’ I murmured in contemptuous tone; ‘The world, poor wretch, will soon forget Thy noble name when thou art gone! Happy, if years of slothful shame Could perish like a noble name— If God did no account require And being with breathing might expire!’ And words of such [contempt] I said, Cold insults o'er a dying bed, Which as they darken memory now Disturb my pulse and flush my brow; I know that Justice holds in store, Reprisals for those days of gore— Not for the blood, but for the sin Of stifling mercy's voice within. The blood spilt gives no pang at all; It is my conscience haunting me, Telling how oft my lips shed gall On many a thing too weak to be, Even in thought, my [enemy]— And whispering ever, when I pray, ‘God will repay—God will repay!’ He does repay and soon and well The deeds that turn his earth to hell The wrongs that aim a venomed dart Through nature at the Eternal Heart— Surely my cruel tongue was cursed I know my prisoner heard me speak A transient gleam of feeling burst And wandered o'er his haggard cheek And from his quivering lids there stole A look to melt a demon's soul A silent prayer more powerful far Than any breathed petitions are Pleading in mortal agony To mercy's Source but not to me— Now I recall that glance and groan And wring my hands in vain distress Then I was adamantine stone Nor felt one touch of tenderness— My plunder ta'en I left him there Without [one breath] of morning air To struggle with his last despair Regardless of the wildered cry Which wailed for death yet wailed to die I left him there unwatched alone And eager sought the court below Where o'er a trough of chiselled stone An ice cold well did gurgling flow The water in its basin shed A stranger tinge of fiery red. I drank and scarcely marked the hue My food was dyed with crimson too As I went out a [ragged] child With wasted cheek and ringlets wild A shape of fear and misery Raised up her [helpless] hands to me And begged her father's face to see I spurned the piteous wretch away Thy father's [face] is lifeless clay As thine mayst be ere fall of day Unless the truth be quickly told Where thou hast hid thy father's gold Yet in the intervals of pain He heard my taunts and moaned again And mocking moans did I reply And asked him why he would not die In noble agony—uncomplaining. Was it not foul disgrace and shame To thus disgrace his ancient name? Just then a comrade came hurrying in Alas, he cried, sin genders sin For every soldier slain they've sworn To hang up five come morn. They've ta'en of stranglers sixty-three Full thirty from one company And all my father's family And comrade thou hadst only one They've ta'en thy all thy little son Down at my captive's feet I fell I had no option in despair As thou wouldst save thy soul from hell My heart's own darling bid them spare Or human hate and hate divine Blight every orphan flower of thine He raised his head—from death beguiled He wakened up he almost smiled Twice in my arms twice on my knee You stabbed my child and laughed at me And so, with choking voice he said I trust I hope in God she's dead Yet not to thee not even to thee Would I return such misery Such is that [fearful] grief I know I will not cause thee equal woe Write that they harm no infant there Write that it is my latest prayer I wrote—he signed and thus did save My treasure from the gory grave And O my soul longed wildly then To give his saviour life again. But heedless of my gratitude The silent corpse before me lay And still methinks in gloomy mood I see it fresh as yesterday The sad face raised imploringly To mercy's God and not to me— The last [look] of that agony I could not rescue him his child I found alive and tended well But she was full of anguish wild And hated me like we hate hell And weary with her savage woe One moonless night I let her go 169. [Why ask to know what date what clime] Why ask to know what date what clime There dwelt our own humanity Power-worshippers from earliest time Foot-kissers of triumphant crime Crushers of helpless misery Crushing down Justice honouring Wrong If that be feeble this be strong Shedders of blood shedders of tears Self-cursers avid of distress Yet Mocking heaven with senseless prayers For mercy on the merciless It was the autumn of the year When grain grows yellow in the ear Day after day from noon to noon, That August's sun blazed bright as June But we with unregarding eyes Saw panting earth and glowing skies No hand the reaper's sickle held Nor bound the ripe sheaves in the field Our corn was garnered months before, Threshed out and kneaded-up with gore Ground when the ears were milky sweet With furious toil of hoofs and feet I doubly cursed on foreign sod Fought neither for my home nor God</field>

[All day I've toiled but not with pain] All day I've toiled but not with pain In learning's golden mine And now at eventide again The moonbeams softly shine There is no snow upon the ground No frost on wind or wave The south wind blew with gentlest sound And broke their icy grave 'Tis sweet to wander here at night To watch the winter die With heart as summer sunshine light And warm as summer's sky O may I never lose the peace That lulls me gently now Though time should change my youthful face And years should shade my brow True to myself and true to all May I be healthful still And turn away from passion's call And curb my own wild will 171. ['Tis evening now the sun descends] 'Tis evening now the sun descends In golden glory down the sky The city's murmur softly blends With zephyrs breathing gently by And yet it seems a dreary [morn] A dark October [morn] to me And black the piles of rainclouds [borne] Athwart heaven's stormy canopy 172. [There let thy bleeding branch atone] There let thy bleeding branch atone For every torturing tear Shall my young sins my sins alone Be everlasting here? Who bade thee keep that cursed name A pledge for memory As if Oblivion ever came To breathe its bliss on me As if through all the wildering maze Of mad hours left behind I once forgot the early days That thou wouldst call to mind 173. [What winter floods what showers of spring] What winter floods what showers of spring Have drenched the grass by night and day And yet beneath that spectre ring Unmoved and undiscovered lay A mute remembrancer of crime Long lost concealed forgot for years It comes at last to cancel time And waken unavailing tears 174. [All hushed and still within the house] All hushed and still within the house Without—all wind and driving rain But something whispers to my mind Through rain and [through the] wailing wind —Never again Never again? Why not again? Memory has power as real as thine 175. [Iernë's eyes were glazed and dim] Iernë's eyes were glazed and dim When the castle bell tolled one She looked around her dungeon grim The grating cast a doubtful gleam 'Twas one cloud saddened cold moon-beam Iernë gazed as in a dream And thought she saw the sun She thought it was the break of day The night had been so long 176. [But the hearts that once adored me] But the hearts that once adored me Have long forgot their vow And the friends that mustered round me Have all forsaken now 'Twas in a dream revealed to me But not a dream of sleep A dream of watchful agony Of grief that would not weep Now do not harshly turn away 177. [Methinks this heart should rest awhile] Methinks this heart should rest awhile So stilly round the evening falls The veiled sun sheds no parting smile Nor mirth nor music wakes my Halls I have sat lonely all the day Watching the drizzly mist descend And first conceal the hills in grey And then along the valleys wend And I have sat and watched the trees And the sad flowers how drear they blow Those flowers were formed to feel the breeze Wave their light leaves in summer's glow Yet their lives passed in gloomy woe And hopeless comes its dark decline And I lament because I know That cold departure pictures mine 178. [That dreary lake that midnight sky] That dreary lake that midnight sky That wan moon struggling through the cloud That sullen murmur whispering by As if it dared not speak aloud Fall on my heart so sadly now Wither my joy so lonely Touch them not they bloom and smile But their roots are withering all the while Ah 179. [His land may burst the galling chain] His land may burst the galling chain His people may be free again For them a thousand hopes remain But hope is dead for him Soft falls the moonlight on the sea Whose wild waves play at liberty And Gondal's wind sings solemnly Its [native] midnight hymn Around his prison walls it sings His heart is stirred through all its strings Because that sound remembrance brings Of scenes that once have been His soul has left the storm below And reached a realm of sunless snow The region of [unchanging] woe Made voiceless by despair And Gerald's land may burst its chain His subjects may be free again For them a thousand hopes remain But hope is dead for him Set is his sun of liberty Fixed is his earthly destiny A few years of captivity And then a captive's tomb 180. [She dried her tears and they did smile] She dried her tears and they did smile To see her cheeks' returning glow How little dreaming all the while That full heart throbbed to overflow With that sweet look and lively tone And bright eye shining all the day They could not guess at midnight lone How she would weep the time away 181. [Love is like the wild rose briar] Love is like the wild rose briar, Friendship, like the holly tree The holly is dark when the rose briar blooms, But which will bloom most constantly? The wild rose briar is sweet in spring, Its summer blossoms scent the air Yet wait till winter comes again And who will call the wild-briar fair Then scorn the silly rose-wreath now And deck thee with the holly's sheen That when December blights thy brow He still may leave thy garland green—</field>

[Often rebuked, yet always back returning] Often rebuked, yet always back returning To those first feelings that were born with me, And leaving busy chase of wealth and learning For idle dreams of things which cannot be: Today, I will seek not the shadowy region; Its unsustaining vastness waxes drear; And visions rising, legion after legion, Bring the unreal world too strangely near. I'll walk, but not in old heroic traces, And not in paths of high morality, And not among the half-distinguished faces, The clouded forms of long-past history. I'll walk where my own nature would be leading: It vexes me to choose another guide: Where the grey flocks in ferny glens are feeding; Where the wild wind blows on the mountain side. What have those lonely mountains worth revealing? More glory and more grief than I can tell: The earth that wakes one human heart to feeling Can centre both the worlds of Heaven and Hell. The attribution of this poem is questionable. To the Horse Black Eagle Which I Rode at the Battle of Zamorna Swart steed of night, thou hast charged thy last O'er the red war-trampled plain Now fallen asleep is the battle blast It is stilled above the slain Now hushed is the clang of armour bright Thou wilt never bear me more To the deadliest press of the gathering fight Through seas of noble gore And the cold eyes of midnight skies Shall not pour their light on thee When the wearied host of the conqueror lies On a field of victory Rest now in thy glory noble steed Rest all thy wars are done True is the love and high the meed Thou from thy lord hast won In daisied lawns sleep peacefully Dwell by the quiet wave Till death shall sound his signal cry And call thee to thy grave.</field>
