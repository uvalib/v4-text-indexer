      <field name="fulltext">HOW IT ENDS. Take off thy hands, leave me and let us end. Peace, we have done our pastime; why contend? But, if thou wilt, bemoan love's altered power, Cover thy eyes and have thy weeping hour. Love cannot turn the stars, or loose their bands. Take off thy hands. How dead he lies our smiling mock of love, With all the lies he spake, the tales he wove: How beautiful his fallen lustre seemed; Ah, we wake now, but surely then we dreamed, That there was nothing fair on sea or land As Love's light hand. He will not rise, so heavy is his ear: He will not waken, tho' thou rouse him near: Shall his eyes smile, tho' thou make bright thine own, Shall his pulse falter to thy voice alone? Shall he resume old empire at command? Loose, loose thy hand. Nay, for a little, poor and little hour, Soft were his lips, his breathing like a flower, Whose petals breathe incense as to a song. But this, ah, this is changed so very long. Since who can tell the wind and show his way To-morrow say. Let him depart, have ending, sleep or die, Crown him with flowers or ashes, how care I? Languish in chains or free abound in praise, To us at least until the end of days He comes not, when the flower is in the sod And spring is God. Live in thy peace: remove me from thy thought. Live to thyself or be by lover sought, Try our old ways of loving in new eyes, Bring to the glare old grace of secret sighs, Clothe thee with love, but leave me in my rest Of all things best. Why should I break my slumber to revile Love, if thine lay no deeper than thy smile? Shall I abase my soul at thy sweet call? Thou art a weak girl only after all. Peace and repose are all that I demand. Release thy hand. A HEBREW LAMENT AFTER DEFEAT. Thou hast thrust us away to a corner As refuse beneath. Thou hast given our cheek to the scorner, And broken our teeth. Thou hast hired us to death without wages, Because of our sins. Thou hast fastened our feet into cages, And trapped them in gins. Thou hast shattered the joints of our harness And loosened our greaves. Thou hast made us light dross in the furnace, Gray blight in the leaves. Thou hast altered our marvellous places To pasture for cranes. Thou hast broken the flesh of our faces With leprosy stains. Thou hast wrought us reproof with thine arrow, Dismay with thy spear. Thou hast probed all our bones to the marrow, And slain us with fear. The rebuke of thy wasting is grievous As death on our tribe. Our glory and excellence leave us; Fools mutter and gibe. The beam of our sun's way is broken; Our moon bows her head. In the core of our sunset thy token Is darkness for red. To the field we ran under thy mantle, Arrayed in thy name. Behold us a fragment, a cantle, A city of shame. They are slain, who arose in thy shelter, They lie gray in sleep. In the plash of the vine-hills they welter, Like plague-eaten sheep. They are snared in their trust. They are weaker Than sleep, who were strong. Will they sit with the lute-string and beaker At feasting or song? Will they rise and reach lips to their spouses, And govern their hinds? Will they rule with delight in their houses? Weak are they as winds. Will they whine to the snow that she spare them, Or harbour in rain? Can they tell thee the mother that bare them, Or pleasure from pain? All these have inherited silence, Past favour, past light; Thou hast sold them away to the islands, Whose ocean is night. Out of mind in the desolate porches And precinct of shade, They, desiring in dimness no torches, Forget they were made. Shall they smite with the sword, or be smitten, Bring spoil or be spoiled? They are past as a dream; who has written In books how they toiled? They were sleek in all fulness of treasure, Sweet wine and soft bread; They shone, till a tyrannous measure Was dealt to them dead. Wilt thou speak? We are melted with trouble; They sleep, we remain; Wilt thou save, and restore to us double The blood of our slain? Bring again thine own flock to their feeding In sweet pasture ways. In thine hand there is fulness exceeding, All fatness of days. Thou hast broken thy vineyard in anger And wasted its shoots; Thou hast said to the son of the stranger, ‘Go, trample the fruits.’ In rush-pits and reed-beds uncertain We wander till morn. We are clothed round with death as a curtain, Our raiment is scorn. Our slain people lie in each gate-way. Our city for shroud Has the smoke of her burning a great way Seen yellow in cloud. Remove as keen hoar-frost thine evil, Refresh drought with dew. Restore our brave summers thy weevil And canker-worm slew. Bring delight in our desolate garden; Slay these whom we hate. Sprinkle ash in their eyes; give us pardon; Sow grass in their gate. THE SOLDIER'S RETURN. The warrior after years of war Leant in a doorway, bent and gray. He dared not enter, for he saw Her children at their noisy play. ‘Here, trembling at the love-word both, Her first kiss touched me, ripe as May. We plighted here eternal troth That dawn of death I rode away.’ ‘A secret, sister, hear and keep.’ The boy within began to say, ‘I know what made our mother weep To watch our sport the other day. ‘She said, “Sweet death, be swift to me. My lord's love died this many a day.” Guess, who this cruel lord can be—’ The warrior sighed, and moved away. THE SPEAR-HEAD. In a field on a hill pacing alone, Near a gray stone-wall and peat-plash of rushes. Something one mound means, the field's only one, Where the sour autumn wind saddens and hushes. When the wind pauses the weird of the place Greatens in stillness; low whispers in silence Grow with strange faces; Alas, not his face; And the sound comes of a river round islands. Hearken! I fancy a trample of steeds. See, they meet with a clash; lances are broken. One steed goes riderless: one rider bleeds: Has he not brave rippled hair for a token? Soon fades the vision. I'm pacing there still; Musing, with wraiths of old anguish surrounded. Is that a raven's cry half down the hill? Why must it sound like a groan of the wounded? But where he fell a curse rests. It grows bald; Why will no countryman climb up and sow it? Seen from the valley, a broken brown scald, Even the school-children point at and know it. Has the gray hill-gloom infected its grass, Since but a crow or two cares to sail thither? Shrubs in that place have arrived at a pass When it seems worse to exist than to wither. There's mat-grass anyhow; pale, dry as hay. Why should I search every tussock twice over? I had gone seeking a year and a day, When at length what do you think I discover? Treasure! I hurried it home to my nest. Wore my lips out on it till I was wearied. See, like a jewel, it hangs in my breast, Tho' it be only a broken-off spear-head. A LAMENT. Ye glades within whose shade the rose Is withered, where no dews may fall. Ye lulling winds that love repose When cloud comes pausing over all. The wave is hush'd upon the sands, Still is the wave-bird on her nest. And calm the gleaming sunset-bands Reveal their islands in the west. Soon will the ripple move again, Soon every nest outpour its song; Soon in new glory argent rain Will dance its flakes the blue along. Long ere my heart have light again, Long ere my breast be full of song. For till the earth reveal her slain, The night-cloud on my life is strong. FREEDOM OR FETTERS? Come, let us leave, have no smooth words but go; Better break off at once than palter so. Have out the ending, cloud in idle tears. Freedom outweighs regret of altered years Gone by and done. Review the lovely dream we thought to reach; The blind desire that held us each to each; Count out in calmness all the loss and gain; And say, when all is done, could we remain Heart-bound as one? Peace is a nobler thing than loving thee, More than love's sweet is to be trouble-free. We shall not better our old loving ways, And the chain galled us in those half-sweet days Though silken fine. Content thee and depart. Can I control The lapsing month or bind the season's roll? Can I command that change shall flee away? Will Fate, who rules the gods, hear what I say? Is all power mine? You give me your old smiling as I speak; You whisper, I was vain if you were weak. Ah, child, refrain to portion each his blame; Is it delight to weigh how each fault came? Ah, who shall tell? Still, though I be most hungry to begone, Weary of all things, asking peace alone; Yet, if you smile me that old smile again, My soul will grow a weakling, and refrain To say farewell. ACQUIESCENCE. Man, leave the gods their way. Let them, O man, prevail: Mighty and more than thou, How should their anger fail? Why settest thou thy baby palms To wrestle down the thews that may not tire? Why wilt thou vex thyself to be as they, Weakling of sorrow and sleep? Why wilt thou thrust about the world for peace? God is at peace alone. Take from their careless hands The morsels of their pity as they fall: Take from their scornful brows The curse, and call them just. Nay, thou art foolish to have any pride: They use thee as they choose. Count every happy dream As stolen from the envy of their power. Turn at the last to slumber, if no great woe Hath taken thee, secure, That under the warm earth to vex thy sleep Their hands can never come. THE DEATH OF HERACLES. The athlete Heracles had ending thus: He drew that garment steeped in curses on, And felt the poison eat his flesh bone-deep,— Nor could he tear it from him, baleful web,— And knew the mighty horror of his doom Inevitable, clothing him throughout With creeping flame intensest. And he said, ‘My death is on me, comrade, in thy love I charge thee nowise leave me till the end. Thine will be full brief service, for I climb This Œta, there I sacrifice and die.’ And so we clomb together. All day long We toiled up Œta, and the evening fell One red great ball of sun, and flared and split The radiance: and he ever moaning clomb, Moaning and shuddering, and huge agonies Of sweat were on the muscles of his limbs, And in his eyes a dumb pain terrible. And now he clomb, and now in torment sat With set teeth on some boulder, swaying slow His head and rugged beard; and all his breast Lay heaving, and the volumes of its breath Went up in dry hot vapour. Or he sat Staring as in amazement. And I went And touched him and he moved not, and again I touched him. Suddenly the whole man leapt Straightened on the instant, and addressed himself To the sheer hill and leaning clomb. At length It ceased into a level desolate As death, a summit platform: the near clouds Racked over us until the hill itself Seemed giddy with their motion. Cruel winds Flapt icily at our heated limbs, and seemed To bite away in very cruelty The few black shivering grasses in the peat, Or tugged the fangs of heath long dead in cold. And, when he saw the horror of the place, He stayed himself and called with a great voice, ‘Here;’ Suddenly calling it. And I began To pile an altar at his word of all The hill-side nourished, birch and pine and stunt Gray sallow of the peat-tops. He that time Tore at his flesh or heavily sobbing rolled Against the shaly edges. And in fear I built it, tremble-handed, dizzy-eyed; And when it rose he turned his face and cried, ‘O comrade, is all ready?’ And I said, ‘All ready, master.’ Then I lit a brand Of resinous pine storm-riven, as I strake Two clear hill-pebbles, gave blue fire free birth; So stood with a great beating heart to wait The issue, ready with my torch. But he Climbing disspread upon the wood his vast And throbbing frame. And after a deep breath, He gathered up his final strength to speak, And reached his hand, and thus his speech found way:— ‘This is the end, and I am bounded here, And all my ancient triumph is decayed. One agony enwraps me, scalp to heel; So I am made derision to the gods That smile above my torment. This is he The eminent of labours, conqueror, The universal athlete, whose rash arm Would stifle down the evils of the earth. Behold, in what a mesh of woven pain The deity confounds him. Think not thou Hereafter, simple-hearted as was I, To stand between the gods and their desire That man receive no comfort only woes. They hate for us to stand upon our strength And love our degradation chiefly. Thou Consider this, my friend, and think no shame To let them have their wills, and stand aside, Seeing my end, and all this ruined flesh I thought so strong in beautiful living power; And, lo, a little poison quenches all Into a writhing worm, ensheathed with fire; The smoke-sighs of whose torment shall ascend A music to the sleepy gods, a dream Lulling the dew of pleasure in their eyes With echoes of mine infelicity. Have they not cursed these mortals long ago? And every curse is fruitful as a seed: And woe to him who dares disroot but one, Thro' foolish loving of his fellow-men. And now I die: fire only reaps away This stain upon me. But, O comrade, learn I may bequeath thee something, tho' I seem So utterly naked of all honour now, Because thou hast not left a stricken man. Guard thou mine arrows, they to guard are thine. The gall of hydra on their barbs is death. And once a strange seer told me they should end A mighty war of Hellas soon to be. This fell not out in any day of mine. Therefore, if blind-eyed Eris fling this dread Upon the measure of thy time, rejoice, For I have given thee its remedial power, To use as thy heart bends thee. Any way Guard these at least for ancient love of mine.’ And his voice brake; and then he mightily called, ‘Light it!’ and I forbore; and he called twice, ‘If thou dost love me, light it;’ and I lit. Then came the rushing creature of the flame Over and under, writhing into spire And branch and eager inward-licking rings, And mighty stifling pine-smoke, volumed round. And I endured no longer to behold, Exceedingly unnerved, and wailing fled Down the sheer hill, till in a secret vale I found a corner, and there grovelling lay, And brought my face into my hands, and hid The daylight and its doings out. Yet still Sung in mine ears the horrible hiss of the flame. Until, a great while after, I had heart, Again ascending, from the smouldered pyre To gather very reverently his bones. These I concealed in mounded sepulture, Guarding the arrows, which I treasure now To feed my vengeance. Thus died Heracles. THE FALL OF THE TITANS. Beautiful might Of the earth-born children, Brood of the Titans, Ah, utterly fallen! Ye were too noble to sit still Beneath oppression; other spirits Gave Zeus his way. They said, ‘Go to, he wields the thong of masterdom, Exceedingly revengeful; and his plagues Bite to the marrow of his foes. Under his feet is laid Dominion, will ye then Resist him? Nay, not we.’ But ye had other song, Ye Titans feasting with the lion-nerve, Pressing your lips in, as the new young god Played with his thunder, as a raw boy tries His newly-handled sword Upon the bark of trees. Ye saw him, ye grim brood, Scored with a many years, ere he had drawn His baby milk; ye saw him, and ye smiled In that he called, ‘Begone, ye old monsters, time Has done with you. Did Saturn stand before My bathing rays of glory? One finger of my strength Wipes you away like drops of dew.’ Then with a whisper ye rose up, Ye spake no word of council, Ye came one-minded, Still and very terrible. Ye piled the mountains To scale the cloud-line. Heaven saw ye come, and all Her cloud munitions trembled. Then howling fled Zeus and his tyrant-brood, Shrill-voiced as girls, And sheltered them awhile In bestial forms. Awhile, but ye were easy in the flush Of conquest, unrevengeful, when ye might Have crushed them out, Mild were ye and forgave Their extirpation utterly. So these drew breath and guile Reseated them: O Titan sons of earth, O mild great brethren, when the coiling beast Resumed the terrors of his battered crest, There was no mercy for you. Mercy! nay, but horrible Rapture of vengeance, How they settled to it, And all their eyes Swam with the luxury of the feast. Ye have seen a pack Of wild dogs pulling Against each other, At some sick beast they have conquered; And all their teeth Are clogged with their tearings, And they snarl at each other Half-blinded with blood-spurts. Ay me, my Titans— Why have ye fallen? Nobler than these which thrust you under night. For ye were calm and great, And when ye heard The cry of earth your mother, whom these gods Continually afflicted, Ye flung yourselves on the new power, and just Were stifling out the creature at its neck, When it edged slily Its secret teeth out, And stung you down to darkness. Beautiful might Of the earth-born children, Brood of the Titans, Ah, utterly fallen. A SUNRISE EFFECT. I look'd across the river for the day. The clouds came not, the air was very slow, Till on their ridges past an underglow, And tinged in amber cadence all the gray. Then one clear star, set in a branch of rose, Drew in before the river of bold light, Foiling the ragged cloud to left and right, To sort a crystal lake of raying glows. I could not rest; a wilderness of mind Was strong within me; love and shame and thought Of days behind, at that one instant caught To reason from the mental store-house blind. Last thou, fair lily head, beyond night's fall Steep'd in warm sleep, sweet central wish of all! DAFFODILS. I question with the amber daffodils, Sheeting the floors of April, how she fares; Where king-cup buds glow out between the rills And celandine in wide gold beadlets glares. By pastured brows and swelling hedge-row bowers From crumpled leaves the primrose bunches slip, My hot face roll'd in their faint-scented flowers, I dream her rich cheek rests beside my lip. All weird sensations of the fervent prime Are like great harmonies, whose touch can move The glow of gracious impulse: thought and time Renew my love with life, my life with love. When this old world new-born puts glories on, I cannot think she never will be won. A FUTURE. Thy lore may be the vocal memories Of idols overthrown, imperial hours: Thy lute may moan perpetual monodies Of desecrated bowers. Thy creed may be to move in solemn shade, With drooping head, a dream upon an earth Of careless creatures—proudly disarray'd Of any masking mirth. Thy rest may be a rest we cannot know— Beyond sleek envy's scorn and cant of sneers— Pervaded with the secret strength of woe, Yet consecrate to tears.</field>
