      <field name="fulltext">TANNAHILL'S SONGS. THE BRAES O' GLENIFFER. Keen blaws the win' o'er the braes o' Gleniffer, The auld castle's turrets are covered wi' snaw; How changed frae the time when I met wi' my lover Amang the brume bushes by Stanely green shaw; The wild flowers o' simmer were spread a' sae bonnie, The mavis sang sweet frae the green birken tree; But far to the camp they ha'e march'd my dear Johnnie, And now it is winter wi' Nature and me. Then ilk thing around us was blithesome and cheery, Then ilk thing around us was bonnie and braw; Now naething is heard but the win' whistlin' dreary, And naething is seen but the wide-spreadin' snaw. The trees are a' bare, and the birds mute and dowie; They shake the cauld drift frae their wings as they flee, And chirp out their plaints, seeming wae for my Johnnie: 'Tis winter wi' them and 'tis winter wi' me. Yon cauld sleety cloud skiffs alang the bleak mountain, And shakes the dark firs on the stey rocky brae, While down the deep glen bawls the snaw-flooded fountain, That murmur'd sae sweet to my laddie and me. 'Tis no its loud roar, on the wintry win' swellin', 'Tis no the cauld blast brings the tear to my e'e, For, oh, gin I saw my bonnie Scots callan, The dark days o' winter were simmer to me. THOU BONNIE WOOD O' CRAIGIELEE. Thou bonnie wood o' Craigielee, Thou bonnie wood o' Craigielee, Near thee I pass'd life's early day, And won my Mary's heart in thee. The brume, the brier, the birken bush, Bloom bonnie o'er thy flowery lee, An' a' the sweets that ane can wish Frae Nature's hand, are strewed on thee. Thou bonnie wood, etc. Far ben thy dark green plantin's shade, The cushat croodles am'rously, The mavis, doon thy buchted glade, Gars echo ring frae ev'ry tree. Thou bonnie wood, etc. Awa', ye thochtless, murd'rin' gang, Wha tear the nestlin's ere they flee! They 'll sing you yet a cantie sang, Then, oh! in pity let them be! Thou bonnie wood, etc. When winter blaws in sleety showers, Frae aff the Norlan' hills sae hie, He lichtly skiffs thy bonnie bowers, As laith to harm a flower in thee. Thou bonnie wood, etc. Though fate should drag me south the line, Or o'er the wide Atlantic sea, The happy hours I 'll ever mind That I, in youth, ha'e spent in thee. Thou bonnie wood, etc. NOW WINTER IS GANE. The first verse of this song was written by John Hamilton, Edinburgh, for an ancient Irish melody, “The fair-haired child,” but after several futile attempts to proceed further, Tannahill was requested to compose a second verse. [Now winter is gane, and the clouds flee away, Yon bonnie blue sky how delightful to see, Now linties and blackbirds sing on ilka spray That flourishes round Woodhouselee. The hawthorn is blooming, The soft breeze perfuming, O come, my dear lassie, the season is gay, And naething mair lovely can be; The primrose and lily We 'll pu' in the valley, And lean, when we like, on some gowany brae That rises beside Woodhouselee.] Ye mind when the snaw lay sae deep on the hill, When cauld icy cranreuch hung white on the tree, When bushes were leafless, and mournfully still Were the wee birds o' sweet Woodhouselee: When snaw show'rs were fa'ing, And wintry winds blawing, Loud whistling o'er mountain and meadow sae chill, We mark'd it wi' sorrowing e'e; But now since the flowers Again busk the bowers, O come, my dear lassie, wi' smiling goodwill, And wander around Woodhouselee. THE FAREWEEL. Accuse me not, inconstant fair, Of being false to thee, For I was true, would still been so, Hadst thou been true to me. But when I knew thy plighted lips Once to a rival's prest, Love-smothered independence rose, And spurned thee from my breast. The fairest flower in Nature's field Conceals the rankling thorn; So thou, sweet flower! as false as fair, This once kind heart hath torn. 'Twas mine to prove the fellest pangs That slighted love can feel; 'Tis thine to weep that one rash act, Which bids this long fareweel. GLOOMY WINTER'S NOW AWA'. Gloomy Winter's now awa', Saft the westlan' breezes blaw; 'Mang the birks o' Stanely shaw The mavis sings fu' cheerie, O. Sweet the crawflower's early bell Decks Gleniffer's dewy dell, Blooming like thy bonnie sel', My young, my artless dearie, O. Come, my lassie, let us stray O'er Glenkilloch's sunny brae, Blithely spend the gowden day 'Midst joys that never weary, O Tow'ring o'er the Newton Woods, Laverocks fan the snaw-white clouds, Siller saughs, wi' downy buds, Adorn the banks sae briery, O. Round the sylvan fairy nooks Feath'ry breckans fringe the rocks, 'Neath the brae the burnie jouks, And ilka thing is cheerie, O. Trees may bud, and birds may sing, Flowers may bloom, and verdure spring, Joy to me they canna bring, Unless wi' thee, my dearie, O. THE GREY PINIONED LARK. While the grey pinioned lark early mounts to the skies, And cheerily hails the sweet dawn, And the sun, newly risen, sheds the mists from his eyes, And smiles over mountain and lawn, Delighted I stray by the Fairy Woodside, Where the dewdrops the crowflowers adorn, And Nature, array'd in her midsummer's pride, Sweetly smiles to the smile of the morn. Ye dark waving plantings, ye green shady bowers, Your charms ever varying I view; My soul's dearest transports, my happiest hours, Have owed half their pleasures to you. Sweet Ferguslie, hail! thou 'rt the dear sacred grove Where first my young Muse spread her wing; Here Nature first waked me to rapture and love, And taught me her beauties to sing. OUR BONNIE SCOTS LADS. Our bonnie Scots lads in their green tartan plaids, Their blue-belted bonnets, and feathers sae braw, Ranked up on the green were fair to be seen, But my bonnie young laddie was fairest of a'. His cheeks were as red as the sweet heather-bell, Or the red western cloud looking down on the snaw; His lang yellow hair o'er his braid shoulders fell, And the een o' the lasses were fixed on him a'. My heart sunk wi' wae on the wearifu' day, When, torn frae my bosom, they marched him awa'; He bade me farewell; he cried, “Oh, be leal!” And his red cheeks were wet wi' the tears that did fa'. Ah! Harry, my love, though thou ne'er shouldst return, Till life's latest hour I thy absence will mourn; And mem'ry shall fade like a leaf on the tree, Ere my heart spare ae thought on anither but thee. NOW WINTER, WI' HIS CLOUDY BROW. Now winter, wi' his cloudy brow, Is far ayont yon mountains, And spring beholds her azure sky Reflected in the fountains. Now, on the budding slaethorn bank, She spreads her early blossom, And woos the mirly-breasted birds To nestle in her bosom. But lately a' was clad wi' snaw, Sae darksome, dull, and dreary, Now laverocks sing to hail the spring, And Nature all is cheery. Then let us leave the town, my love, And seek our country dwelling, Where waving woods and spreading flow'rs On every side are smiling. We 'll tread again the daisied green, Where first your beauty moved me; We 'll trace again the woodland scene, Where first ye owned ye loved me. We soon will view the roses blaw In a' the charms o' fancy; For doubly dear these pleasures a', When shared with you, my Nancy. LASSIE, WILL YE TAK' A MAN? O lassie, will ye tak' a man, Rich in housin', gear, and lan'? De'il tak' the cash! that I should ban,— Nae mair I 'll be the slave o't. I 'll buy you claes to busk you braw, A riding pony, pad, and a'; On fashion's tap we 'll drive awa', Whip, spur, and a' the lave o't. Oh, poortith is a wintry day, Cheerless, blirtie, cauld, and blae; But basking under Fortune's ray, There 's joy whate'er ye 'd have o't. Then gie 's your han', ye 'll be my wife, I 'll mak' you happy a' your life; We 'll row in love and siller rife, Till death wind up the lave o't. THOU CAULD GLOOMY FEBERWAR. Thou cauld gloomy Feberwar, Oh gin thou wert awa'; I 'm wae to hear thy soughin' winds, I 'm wae to see thy snaw: For my bonnie brave young Highlander, The lad I lo'e so dear, Has vowed to come and see me In the spring o' the year. [Thou cauld, gloomy Feberwar, Hast ne'er a sunny smile? For pity chase the storms afar, And nurse the flowers awhile, For my bonnie brave young Highlander Will keep his word sae dear, When buds begin to open In the spring o' the year. —R. B. M.] YE ECHOES THAT RING. Ye echoes that ring round the woods of Bowgreen, Say, did ye e'er listen sae melting a strain, When lovely young Jessie gaed wand'ring unseen, And sung of her laddie, the pride of the plain? Aye she sang, “Willie, my bonnie young Willie! There 's no a sweet flower on the mountain or valley, Mild blue-spreckled crawflower, nor wild woodland lily, But tines a' its sweets in my bonnie young swain. Thou goddess of love, keep him constant to me, Else, with'ring in sorrow, poor Jessie shall dee!” Her laddie had strayed through the dark leafy wood, His thoughts were a' fixed on his dear lassie's charms, He heard her sweet voice, all transported he stood, 'Twas the soul of his wishes—he flew to her arms. “No, my dear Jessie! my lovely young Jessie! Through simmer, through winter, I 'll daut and caress thee; Thou 'rt dearer than life! thou 'rt my ae only lassie! Then, banish thy bosom these needless alarms: Yon red seeting sun sooner changeful shall be, Ere, wav'ring in falsehood, I wander frae thee.” THE DUSKY GLEN. We 'll meet beside the dusky glen, on yon burn side, Where the bushes form a cozy den, on yon burn side; Though the broomy knowes be green, Yet, there we may be seen, But we 'll meet, we 'll meet at e'en, down by yon burn side. I 'll lead thee to the birken bower, on yon burn side; Sae sweetly wove wi' woodbine flower, on yon burn side; There the busy prying eye Ne'er disturbs the lovers' joy, While in ither's arms they lie, down by yon burn side. Awa', ye rude unfeeling crew, frae yon burn side, Those fairy scenes are no for you, by yon burn side; There fancy smooths her theme, By the sweetly murmuring stream, And the rock-lodged echoes skim, down by yon burn side. Now the planting taps are tinged wi' goud, on yon burn side, And gloamin' draws her foggy shroud o'er yon burn side; Far frae the noisy scene, I 'll through the fields alane, There we 'll meet, my ain dear Jean! down by yon burn side. MY DEAR HIGHLAND LADDIE, O. Blithe was the time when he fee'd wi' my faither, O, Happy were the days when we herded thegither, O, Sweet were the hours when he row'd me in his plaidie, O, And vowed to be mine, my dear Highland laddie, O. But ah! waes me! wi' their sodgering sae gaudy, O, The laird 's wysed awa' my braw Highland laddie, O; Misty are the glens, and the dark hills sae cloudy, O, That aye seemed sae blithe wi' my dear Highland laddie, O. The blaeberry banks now are lonesome and dreary, O, Muddy are the streams that gushed down sae clearly, O, Silent are the rocks that echoed sae gladly, O, The wild melting strains of my dear Highland laddie, O, He pu'd me the cranberry, ripe frae the boggy fen, He pu'd me the strawberry, red frae the foggy glen, He pu'd me the rowan frae the wild steep sae giddy, O, Sae loving and kind was my dear Highland laddie, O. Farewell, my ewes! and farewell, my doggie, O, Farewell, ye knowes! now sae cheerless and scroggie, O; Farewell, Glenfeoch! my mammie and my daddie, O, I will leave you a' for my dear Highland laddie, O. JESSIE, THE FLOWER O' DUNBLANE. The sun has gane down o'er the lofty Benlomond, And left the red clouds to preside o'er the scene, While lanely I stray in the calm simmer gloaming, To muse on sweet Jessie, the flower o' Dunblane. How sweet is the brier, wi' its saft faulding blossom, And sweet is the birk, wi' its mantle o' green; Yet sweeter, and fairer, and dear to this bosom, Is lovely young Jessie, the flower o' Dunblane. She 's modest as ony, and blithe as she 's bonnie, For guileless simplicity marks her its ain; And far be the villain, divested o' feeling, Wha'd blight in its bloom the sweet flower o' Dunblane. Sing on, thou sweet mavis, thy hymn to the e'enin', Thou 'rt dear to the echoes o' Calderwood glen; Sae dear to this bosom, sae artless and winning, Is charming young Jessie, the flower o' Dunblane. How lost were my days till I met wi' my Jessie, The sports o' the city seemed foolish and vain; I ne'er saw a nymph I would ca' my dear lassie, Till charmed wi' sweet Jessie, the flower o' Dunblane. Tho' mine were the station o' loftiest grandeur, Amidst its profusion I 'd languish in pain, And reckon as naething the height o' its splendour, If wanting sweet Jessie, the flower o' Dunblane. The attribution of this poem is questionable. ALL HAIL! YE DEAR ROMANTIC SCENES. Semple inclines to the opinion that this song owes its authorship to James Scadlock, a rhyming friend of Tannahill's, and that it has been inadvertently included among Tannahill's songs. [All hail! ye dear romantic scenes, Where oft, as eve stole o'er the sky, Ye 've found me by the mountain streams, Where blooming wild-flowers charm the eye. The sun 's now setting in the west— Mild are his beams on hill and plain; No sound is heard save Killoch burn, Deep murm'ring down its woody glen. Green be thy banks, thou silver stream, That winds the flowery braes among, Where oft I 've woo'd the Scottish muse, And raptur'd wove the rustic song.] O LADDIE, CAN YE LEAVE ME? O laddie, can ye leave me? Alas! 'twill break this constant heart! There 's nought on earth can grieve me Like this, that we must part. Think on the tender vow you made Beneath the secret birken shade, And can you now deceive me! Is a' your love but art? THE MIDGES DANCE ABOON THE BURN. The midges dance aboon the burn, The dews begin to fa', The pairtricks down the rushy holm Set up their evening ca'. Now loud and clear the blackbird's sang Rings through the briery shaw, While flitting gay, the swallows play Around the castle wa'. Beneath the golden gloamin' sky The mavis mends her lay, The redbreast pours his sweetest strains To charm the lingering day; While weary yeldrins seem to wail Their little nestlings torn, The merry wren, frae den to den, Gaes jinking through the thorn. The roses fauld their silken leaves, The foxglove shuts its bell, The honeysuckle and the birk Spread fragrance through the dell. Let others crowd the giddy court Of mirth and revelry, The simple joys that Nature yields Are dearer far to me. LANGSYNE, BESIDE THE WOODLAND BURN. Langsyne, beside the woodland burn, Amang the broom sae yellow, I lean'd me 'neath the milk-white thorn, On Nature's mossy pillow: A' round my seat the flowers were strew'd, That frae the wild-wood I had pu'd To weave mysel' a summer snood To pleasure my dear fellow. I twin'd the woodbine round the rose, Its richer hues to mellow, Green sprigs of fragrant birk I chose, To busk the sedge sae yellow; The craw-flower blue, and meadow-pink, I wove in primrose-braided link, But little, little did I think I should have wove the willow. My bonnie lad was forced afar, Tost on the raging billow; Perhaps he 's fa'en in bloody war, Or wreck'd on rocky shallow: Yet aye I hope for his return, As round our wonted haunts I mourn, And often by the woodland burn I pu' the weeping willow. FROM THE RUDE BUSTLING CAMP. From the rude bustling camp to the calm rural plain, I 'm come, my dear Jeanie, to bless thee again; Still burning for honour our warriors may roam, But the laurel I wished for, I 've won it at home. All the glories of conquest no joy could impart, When far from the kind little girl of my heart; Now, safely returned, I will leave thee no more, But love my dear Jeanie till life's latest hour. The sweets of retirement, how pleasing to me; Possessing all worth, my dear Jeanie, in thee! Our flocks' early bleating will wake us to joy, And our raptures exceed the warm tints in the sky! In sweet rural pastimes our days still will glide, Till Time, looking back, will admire at his speed; Still blooming in virtue, though youth then be o'er, I 'll love my dear Jeanie till life's latest hour. YE DEAR ROMANTIC SHADES. Far from the giddy court of mirth, Where sickening follies reign, By Levern banks I wander forth To hail each sylvan scene. All hail, ye dear romantic shades! Ye banks, ye woods, and sunny glades! Here oft the musing poet treads In Nature's riches great: Contrasts the country with the town, Makes Nature's beauties all his own, And, borne on Fancy's wings, looks down On empty pride and state. By dewy morn, or sultry noon, Or sober evening gray, I often quit the dinsome town, By Levern banks to stray; Or from the upland's mossy brow Enjoy the fancy-pleasing view Of streamlets, woods, and fields below, And sweetly varied scene. Give riches to the miser's care, Let folly shine in fashion's glare; Give me the wealth of peace and health, With all their happy train. BRAVE LEWIE ROY. Brave Lewie Roy was the flower of our Highlandmen, Tall as the oak on the lofty Benvoirlich, Fleet as the light-bounding tenants of Fillan glen, Dearer than life to his lovely nighean choidheach. Pronounced neen voiuch—beautiful maid. Lone was his biding, the cave of his hiding, When forced to retire with our gallant Prince Charlie; Though manly and fearless, his bold heart was cheerless, Away from the lady he aye loved so dearly. [But woe on the bloodthirsty mandates of Cumberland, Woe on the bloodthirsty gang that fulfilled them; Poor Caledonia! bleeding and plunder'd land, Where shall thy children now shelter and shield them? Keen prowl the cravens like merciless ravens, Their prey the devoted adherents of Charlie; Brave Lewie is taken, cowardly hacked and slain, Ah! his nighean choidheach will mourn for him sairly. —A. R. THE FLOWER O' LEVERN SIDE. Ye sunny braes that skirt the Clyde, Wi' simmer flowers sae braw, There 's ae sweet flower on Levern side That 's fairer than them a': Yet aye it droops its head in wae, Regardless o' the sunny ray, And wastes its sweets frae day to day, Beside the lonely shaw. Wi' leaves a' steeped in sorrow's dew, False, cruel man it seems to rue, Wha aft the sweetest flower will pu', Then rend its heart in twa. Thou bonnie flower on Levern side, Oh, gin thoul't be but mine, I 'll tend thee wi' a lover's pride, Wi' love that ne'er shall tine. I 'll take thee to my sheltering bower, And shield thee frae the beating shower; Unharmed by aught, thou l't bloom secure Frae a' the blasts that blaw. Thy charms surpass the crimson dye That streaks the glowing western sky; But, here, unshaded, soon thou l't die, And lone will be thy fa'. CROOKSTON CASTLE'S LANELY WA'S. Through Crookston Castle's lanely wa's The wintry wind howls wild and dreary; Though mirk the cheerless e'ening fa's, Yet I ha'e vow'd to meet my Mary. Ah! Mary, though the winds should rave Wi' jealous spite to keep me frae thee, The darkest stormy night I 'd brave For ae sweet secret moment wi' thee. Loud o'er Cardonald's rocky steep Rude Cartha pours in boundless measure, But I will ford the whirling deep That roars between me and my treasure. Yes, Mary, though the torrent rave Wi' jealous spite to keep me frae thee, Its deepest flood I 'd bauldly brave For ae sweet secret moment wi' thee. The watch-dog's howling loads the blast, And makes the nightly wand'rer eerie, But when the lonesome way is past, I 'll to this bosom clasp my Mary. Yes, Mary, though stern winter rave, Wi' a' his storms, to keep me frae thee, The wildest dreary night I 'd brave For ae sweet secret moment wi' thee. UNREQUITED LOVE. Lone in yon dark sequester'd grove, Poor hapless Lubin strays; A prey to ill-requited love, He spends his joyless days. Ah! cruel Jessie, couldst thou know What worthy heart was thine, Thou ne'er hadst wronged poor Lubin so, Nor left that heart to pine. YOUNG DONALD AND HIS LAWLAN BRIDE. Lawlan lassie, wilt thou go Where the hills are clad wi' snow; Where, beneath the icy steep, The hardy shepherd tends his sheep? Ill, nor wae, shall thee betide, When row'd within my Hielan' plaid. Soon the voice o' cheery spring Will gar a' our plantin's ring; Soon our bonnie heather braes Will put on their simmer claes; On the mountain's sunny side We 'll lean us on my Hielan' plaid. When the simmer spreads her flow'rs, Busks the glen in leafy bow'rs, Then we 'll seek the caller shade, Lean us on the primrose bed; While the burning hours preside, I 'll screen thee wi' my Hielan' plaid. Then we 'll leave the sheep and goat, I will launch the bonnie boat, Skim the loch in cantie glee, Rest the oars to pleasure thee; When chilly breezes sweep the tide, I 'll hap thee wi' my Hielan' plaid. Lawlan lads may dress mair fine, Woo in words mair saft than mine; Lawlan lads ha'e mair o' airt; A' my boast 's an honest heart, Whilk shall ever be my pride: To row thee in my Hielan' plaid! “Bonnie lad, ye 've been sae leel, My heart would break at our fareweel; Lang your love has made me fain: Tak' me,—tak' me for your ain!” 'Cross the Firth awa' they glide, Young Donald and his Lawlan bride. THE LASS O' ARRANTEENIE. Far lane amang the Highland hills, 'Midst Nature's wildest grandeur, By rocky dens, and woody glens, With weary steps I wander: The langsome way, the darksome day, The mountain mist sae rainy, Are naught to me when gaun to thee, Sweet lass o' Arranteenie. Yon mossy rosebud down the howe, Just opening fresh and bonnie, Blinks sweetly 'neath the hazel bough, And 's scarcely seen by ony: Sae, sweet amidst her native hills, Obscurely blooms my Jeanie— Mair fair and gay than rosy May, The flower o' Arranteenie. Now, from the mountain's lofty brow, I view the distant ocean; There avarice guides the bounding prow, Ambition courts promotion. Let fortune pour her golden store, Her laurelled favours many; Give me but this, my soul's first wish, The lass o' Arranteenie. THE BRAES O' BALQUHITHER. Let us go, lassie, go, To the braes o' Balquhither, Where the blaeberries grow 'Mang the bonnie Highland heather; Where the deer and the rae, Lightly bounding together, Sport the lang simmer day On the braes o' Balquhither. I will twine thee a bower By the clear crystal fountain, And I 'll cover it o'er Wi' the flowers o' the mountain; I will range through the wilds, And the deep glens sae dreary, And return wi' their spoils To the bower o' my deary. When the rude wintry win' Idly raves round our dwelling, And the roar of the linn On the night breeze is swelling, So merrily we 'll sing, As the storm rattles o'er us, 'Till the dear shieling ring Wi' the light lilting chorus. Now the simmer is in prime, Wi' the flowers richly blooming, And the wild mountain thyme A' the moorlands perfuming; To our dear native scenes Let us journey together, Where glad innocence reigns 'Mang the braes o' Balquhither. THE DEFEAT OF THE FRENCH. Written at the time of a threatened invasion. From hill to hill the bugles sound The soul-arousing strain, The war-bred coursers paw the ground, And, foaming, champ the rein. Their steel-clad riders bound on high— A bold defensive host; With valour fired, away they fly, Like lightning, to the coast. And now they view the wide-spread lines Of the invading foe; Now skill with British bravery joins To strike one final blow. Now on they rush with giant stroke, Ten thousand victims bleed: They trample on the iron yoke Which France for us decreed. Now view the trembling vanquish'd crew Kneel o'er their prostrate arms, Implore respite of vengeance, due For all these dire alarms. Now, while Humanity's warm glow Half weeps the guilty slain, Let conquest gladden every brow, And godlike mercy reign. Thus fancy paints that awful day, Yes, dreadful, should it come; But Britain's sons, in stern array, Shall brave its darkest gloom. Who fights, his native rights to save, His worth shall have its claim; The Bard will consecrate his grave, And give his name to fame. LOUDON'S BONNIE WOODS AND BRAES. Loudon's bonnie woods and braes, I maun lea' them a', lassie; Wha can thole when Britain's faes Would gi'e Britons law, lassie? Wha would shun the field of danger? Wha frae Fame would live a stranger? Now, when Freedom bids avenge her, Wha would shun her ca', lassie? Loudon's bonnie woods and braes Ha'e seen our happy bridal days, And gentle hope shall soothe thy waes When I am far awa', lassie. Hark! the swelling bugle sings, Yielding joy to thee, laddie; But the dolefu' bugle brings Waefu' thoughts to me, laddie. Lanely I may climb the mountain, Lanely stray beside the fountain, Still the weary moments countin', Far frae love and thee, laddie. O'er the gory fields of war, When Vengeance drives his crimson car, Thou 'lt maybe fa', frae me afar, And nane to close thy e'e, laddie. O resume thy wonted smile! O suppress thy fears, lassie! Glorious honour crowns the toil That the soldier shares, lassie. Heav'n will shield thy faithful lover Till the vengeful strife is over, Then we 'll meet, nae mair to sever Till the day we dee, lassie; 'Midst our bonnie woods and braes We 'll spend our peaceful, happy days, As blithe 's yon lightsome lamb that plays On Loudon's flowery lea, lassie. THE SOLDIER'S ADIEU. The weary sun 's gane doun the west, The birds sit nodding on the tree, All Nature now inclines for rest, But rest allow'd there 's nane for me. The trumpet calls to War's alarms, The rattling drum forbids my stay; Ah! Nancy, bless thy soldier's arms, Ere morn I will be far away. I grieve to leave my comrades dear, I mourn to leave my native shore, To leave my aged parents here, And the bonnie lass whom I adore. But tender thoughts must now be hushed, When duty calls, I must obey; Fate wills it so that part we must, The morn I will be far away. Adieu! dear Scotland's sea-beat coast! Ye misty vales and mountains blue! When on the heaving ocean tost, I 'll cast a wishful look to you. And now, dear Nancy, fare-thee-weel! May Providence thy guardian be! And in the camp, or in the fiel', My constant thoughts shall turn to thee. WEEP NOT, MY LOVE. O weep not, my love, though I go to the war, For soon I 'll return rich with honours to thee; The soul-rousing pibroch is sounding afar, And the clans are assembling in Morar-craiglee: Our flocks are all plunder'd, our herdsmen are murder'd, And, fir'd with oppression, aveng'd we shall be; To-morrow we 'll vanquish these ravaging English, And then I 'll return to thy baby and thee. Slow rose the morn on Dunscarron's dark brow, Firm rose our youths in their fighting array, Powerful as Morven they rush'd on the foe, And the din of the battlefield deafened the day; The conflict was glorious, our clans were victorious, Yet sad was the Bard the dark herald to be,— Ah! poor weeping Flora, thy dear promised Morar Will never return to thy baby and thee. THE SOLDIER'S FUNERAL. Now let the procession move solemn and slow, While the soft mournful music accords with our woe, While friendship's warm tears round his ashes are shed, And soul-melting memory weeps for the dead. Kind, good-hearted fellow as ever was known! So kind and so good, every heart was his own; Now, alas! low in death, are his virtues all o'er? How painful the thought, we will see him no more! In camp or in quarters he still was the same, Each countenance brighten'd wherever he came; When the wars of his country compell'd him to roam, He cheerful would say, all the world was his home. And when the fierce conflict of armies began, He fought like a lion, yet felt as a man; For when British brav'ry had vanquish'd the foe, He 'd weep o'er the dead by his valour laid low. Ye time-fretted mansions! ye mould'ring piles! Loud echo his praise through your long-vaulted aisles; If haply his shade nightly glide through your gloom, O tell him our hearts lie with him in the tomb! And say, though he 's gone, long his worth shall remain, Remember'd, belov'd, by the whole of the men.— Whoe'er acts like him, with a warm feeling heart, Friendship's tears drop applause at the close of his part. THE LAMENT OF WALLACE AFTER THE BATTLE OF FALKIRK. Thou dark-winding Carron, once pleasing to see, To me thou canst never give pleasure again; My brave Caledonians lie low on the lea, And thy streams are deep-tinged with the blood of the slain. Ah! base-hearted treachery has doomed our undoing,— My poor bleeding country, what more can I do? Even valour looks pale o'er the red field of ruin, And Freedom beholds her best warriors laid low. Farewell, ye dear partners of peril! farewell! Though buried ye lie in one wide bloody grave, Your deeds shall ennoble the place where ye fell, And your names be enroll'd with the sons of the brave. But I, a poor outcast, in exile must wander, Perhaps, like a traitor, ignobly must die! On thy wrongs, O my country! indignant I ponder— Ah! woe to the hour when thy Wallace must fly! THE SOLDIER'S WIDOW. The cold wind blows O'er the drifted snows, Loud howls the rain-lash'd naked wood; Weary I stray, On my lonesome way, And my heart is faint for want of food: Pity a wretch left all forlorn, On life's wide wintry waste to mourn; The gloom of night fast veils the sky, And pleads for your humanity. On valour's bed My Henry died, In the cheerless desert is his tomb: Now lost to joy, With my little boy In woe and want I wander home. O never, never will you miss The boon bestow'd on deep distress; For dear to Heaven is the glist'ning eye That beams benign humanity. RAB RORYSON'S BONNET. Ye 'll a' ha'e heard tell o' Rab Roryson's bonnet, Ye 'll a ha'e heard tell o' Rab Roryson's bonnet; 'Twas no for itsel', 'twas the head that was in it, Gar'd a' bodies talk o' Rab Roryson's bonnet. This bonnet, that theekit his wonderfu' head, Was his shelter in winter, in simmer his shade; And at kirk, or at market, or bridals, I ween, A braw gawcier bonnet there never was seen. Wi' a round rosy tap, like a meikle blackboyd, It was slouched just a kenning on either hand side; Some maintained it was black, some maintained it was blue, It had something o' baith, as a body may trow. But, in sooth, I assure you, for ought that I saw, Still his bonnet had naething uncommon ava'; Though the whole parish talked o' Rab Roryson's bonnet, 'Twas a' for the marvellous head that was in it. That head, let it rest—it is now in the mools,— Though in life a' the warld beside it were fools; Yet o' what kind o' wisdom his head was possessed, Nane e'er kenned but himsel', sae there 's nane that will miss't. There are some still in life wha eternally blame, Wha on buts and on ifs rear their fabric o' fame; Unto such I inscribe this most elegant sonnet, Sae let them be crooned wi' Rab Roryson's bonnet! MINE AIN DEAR SOMEBODY. When gloaming treads the heels of day, And birds sit cowering on the spray, Alang the flowery hedge I stray, To meet mine ain dear somebody. The scented brier, the fragrant bean, The clover bloom, the dewy green, A' charm me as I rove at e'en, To meet mine ain dear somebody. Let warriors prize the hero's name, Let mad ambition tower for fame, I 'm happier in my lowly hame, Obscurely blest wi' somebody. DISABLED SEAMAN. 'Mongst life's many cares there is none so provoking, As when a brave seaman, disabled and old, Must crouch to the worthless, and stand the rude mocking Of those who have nought they can boast but their gold. Poor Tom, once so high on the list of deserving, By captain and crew none so dearly was prized, At home now laid up, worn with many years' serving, Poor Tom takes his sup, and poor Tom is despised. Yet, Care thrown a-lee, see old Tom in his glory, Placed snug with a shipmate, whose life once he saved, Recounting the feats of some bold naval story, The battles they fought and the storms they had braved. In his country's defence he has dared every danger, His valorous, deeds he might boast undisguised; Yet home-hearted landsman hold Tom as a stranger, Poor Tom loves his sup, and poor Tom is despised. Myself, too, am old, rather rusty for duty, Yet still I 'll prefer the wide ocean to roam; I 'd join some bold corsair, and live upon booty, Before I 'd be gibed by these sucklings at home. Poor Tom, fare-thee-well! for by heaven, 'tis provoking, When thus a brave seaman, disabled and old, Must crouch to the worthless, and stand the rude mocking Of those who have nought they can boast but their gold. THE WORN SOLDIER. The Queensferry boatie rows light, And light is the heart that it bears, For it brings the poor soldier safe back to his home, From many long toilsome years. How sweet are his green native hills, As they smile to the beams of the west; But sweeter by far is the sunshine of hope That gladdens the soldier's breast! I can well mark the tears of his joy, As the wave-beaten pier he ascends, For already, in fancy, he enters his home, 'Midst the greetings of tender friends. But fled are his visions of bliss, All his transports but rose to deceive; He found the dear cottage a tenantless waste, And his kindred all sunk in the grave. Lend a sigh to the soldier's grief, For now he is helpless and poor, And, forced to solicit a slender relief, He wanders from door to door. To him let your answers be mild, And, oh! to the suff'rer be kind! For the look of indiff'rence, the frown of disdain, Bears hard on a generous mind. RETURN O' GALLANT SONS. Now, Marion, dry your tearfu' e'e, Gae break your rock in twa, For sune your gallant sons ye 'll see, Returned in safety a'. O wow, gudeman, my heart is fain! An' shall I see my bairns again, A' seated roun' our ain hearth-stane, Nae mair to gang awa'? BAROCHAN JEAN. 'Tis ha'ena ye heard, man, o' Barochan Jean? And ha'ena ye heard, man, o' Barochan Jean? How death and starvation came o'er the haill nation, She wrought sic mischief wi' her twa pawky een. The lads and the lasses were deeing in dizzens, The tane killed wi' love, and the tither wi' spleen; The ploughing, the sawing, the shearing, the mawing,— A' wark was forgotten for Barochan Jean. Frae the south and the north, o'er the Tweed and the Forth, Sic coming and ganging there never was seen; The comers were cheery, the gangers were blearie, Despairing, or hoping for Barochan Jean. The carlines at hame were a' girning and graning, The bairns were a' greeting frae morning till e'en, They got naething for crowdy but runts boiled to sowdie, For naething gat growing for Barochan Jean. The doctors declared it was past their descriving, The ministers said 'twas a judgment for sin, But they lookit sae blae, and their hearts were sae wae, I was sure they were deeing for Barochan Jean. The burns on roadsides were a' dry wi' their drinking, Yet a' wadna sloken the drouth i' their skin; A' around the peat-stacks, and alangst the dyke-backs, E'en the winds were a' sighing, “Sweet Barochan Jean!” The timmer ran done wi' the making o' coffins, Kirkyards o' their sward were a' howkit fu' clean, Dead lovers were packit like herring in barrels, Sic thousands were deeing for Barochan Jean. But mony braw thanks to the Laird o' Glenbrodie, The grass owre their graves is now bonnie and green: He stole the proud heart of our wanton young lady, And spoiled a' the charms o' her twa pawky een. THE BARD OF GLENULLIN. Though my eyes are grown dim, and my locks are turn'd gray, I feel not the storms of life's bleak wintry day, For my cot is well thatch'd, and my barns are full stor'd, And cheerful Content still presides at my board: Warm-hearted Benevolence stands at my door, Dispensing her gifts to the wandering poor; The glow of the heart does my bounty repay, And lightens the cares of life's bleak wintry day. From the summit of years I look down on the vale, Where age pines in sorrow, neglected and pale; There the sunshine of fortune scarce deigns to bestow One heart-cheering smile to the wand'rers below. From the sad dreary prospect this lesson I drew, That those who are helpless are friended by few; So, with vigorous industry, I smoothed the rough way That leads through the vale of life's bleak wintry day. Then, my son, let the Bard of Glenullin advise (For years can give counsel, experience makes wise): 'Midst thy wanderings, let honour for aye be thy guide, O'er thy actions let honesty ever preside. Then, though hardships assail thee, in virtue thou'lt smile, For light is the heart that 's untainted with guile; But, if Fortune attend thee, my counsels obey, Prepare for the storms of life's bleak wintry day. THE WANDERING BARD. Chill the wintry winds were blowing, Foul the murky night was snowing, Through the storm the minstrel, bowing, Sought the inn on yonder moor. All within was warm and cheery, All without was cold and dreary, There the wanderer, old and weary, Thought to pass the night secure. Softly rose his mournful ditty, Suiting to his tale of pity; But the master, scoffing, witty, Check'd his strain with scornful jeer: “Hoary vagrant, frequent comer, Canst thou guide thy gains of summer? No, thou old intruding thrummer, Thou canst have no lodging here.” Slow the bard departed, sighing; Wounded worth forbade replying; One last feeble effort trying, Faint, he sunk no more to rise. Through his harp the breeze sharp ringing, Wild his dying dirge was singing, While his soul, from insult springing, Sought its mansion in the skies. Now, though wintry winds be blowing, Night be foul, with raining, snowing, Still the traveller, that way going, Shuns the inn upon the moor. Though within 'tis warm and cheery, Though without 'tis cold and dreary, Still he minds the minstrel weary, Spurn'd from that unfriendly door. THE KEBBUCKSTON WEDDING. Auld Wattie of Kebbuckston brae, With lear and reading of books auld-farren,— What think ye! the body came owre the day And tauld us he 's gaun to be married to Mirren. We a' got a bidding To gang to the wedding, Baith Johnnie and Sandie, and Nellie and Nannie; And Tam o' the Knowes, He swears and he vows, At the dancing he 'll face the bride with his granny. A' the lads ha'e trystet their joes: Slee Willie came up and ca'd on Nellie; Although she was hecht to Geordie Bowse, She 's gi'en him the gunk and she 's gaun wi' Willie. Wee collier Johnnie Has yoket his pony, And's aff to the town for a lading of nappy, Wi' fouth of good meat To serve us to eat; Sae with fuddling and feasting we 'll a' be fu' happy. Wee Patie Brydie's to say the grace— The body's aye ready at dredgies and weddings; And Flunkie M'Fee, of the Skiverton place, Is chosen to scuttle the pies and the puddings: For there'll be plenty Of ilka thing dainty, Baith lang kail and haggis, and ev'ry thing fitting; With luggies of beer, Our wizzens to clear; Sae the de'il fill his kyte wha gaes clung frae the meeting. Lowrie has caft Gibbie Cameron's gun, That his auld gutcher bore when he follow'd Prince Charlie; The barrel was rusted and black as the grun, But he 's ta'en't to the smiddy and's fettled it rarely. With wallets of pouther, His musket he 'll shouther, And ride at our head, to the bride's a-parading; At ilka farm town He 'll fire them three roun', Till the haill kintra ring with the Kebbuckston Wedding. Jamie and Johnnie maun ride the broose, For few like them can sit in the saddle; And Willie Ga'breath, the best o' bows, Is trysted to jig in the barn with his fiddle. With whisking and flisking, And reeling and wheeling, The young anes are like to loup out of the body; And Neilie M'Nairn, Though sair forfairn, He vows that he 'll wallop twa sets with the howdie. Sannie M'Nab, wi' his tartan trews, Has hecht to come down in the midst of the caper, And gi'e us three wallops of merry shantrews, With the true Highland fling of Macrimmon the piper. Sic hipping and skipping, And springing and flinging, I 'se wad that there 's name in the Lawlands can waff it! Faith! Willie maun fiddle, And jirgum and diddle, And screed till the sweat fa's in beads frae his haffet. Then gi'e me your hand, my trusty good frien', And gi'e me your word, my worthy auld kimmer, Ye 'll baith come owre on Friday bedeen, And join us in ranting and tooming the timmer. With fouth of good liquor, We 'll haud at the bicker, And lang may the mailing of Kebbuckston flourish; For Wattie's sae free, Between you and me, I 'se warrant he 's bidden the half of the parish. A GEM OF PEARLY DEW I marked a gem of pearly dew, While wandering near yon misty mountain, Which bore the tender blade so low, It dropped it off into the fountain. So thou hast wrung this gentle heart, Which in its core was proud to wear thee, Till, drooping sick beneath thy art, It, sighing, found it could not bear thee. Adieu, thou faithless fair! unkind! Thy falsehood dooms that we must sever; Thy vows were as the passing wind, That fans the flower, then dies for ever. And think not that this gentle heart, Though in its core 'twas proud to wear thee, Shall longer droop beneath thy art; No, cruel fair! it cannot bear thee. THE HARPER OF MULL. When Rosie was faithful, how happy was I! Still gladsome as summer the time glided by; I played my harp cheery, while fondly I sang Of the charms of my Rosie the winter nights lang. But now I 'm as waefu' as waefu' can be, Come simmer, come winter, 'tis a' ane to me: For the dark gloom of falsehood sae clouds my sad soul, That cheerless for aye is the Harper of Mull. I wander the glens and the wild woods alane, In their deepest recesses I make my sad mane; My harp's mournful melody joins in the strain, While sadly I sing of the days that are gane. Though Rosie is faithless, she 's no the less fair, And the thought of her beauty but feeds my despair; With painful remembrance my bosom is full, And weary of life is the Harper of Mull. As slumb'ring I lay by the dark mountain stream, My lovely young Rosie appear'd in my dream; I thought her still kind, and I ne'er was sae blest, As in fancy I clasp'd the dear nymph to my breast. Thou false fleeting vision, too soon thou wert o'er! Thou wak'dst me to tortures unequall'd before; But death's silent slumbers my griefs soon shall lull, And the green grass wave over the Harper of Mull. FAITHFUL ELLEN MORE. The sun had kissed green Erin's waves, The dark blue mountains towered between, Mild evening's dews refreshed the leaves, The moon unclouded rose serene, When Ellen wandered forth unseen, All lone her sorrows to deplore; False was her lover, false her friend, And false was hope to Ellen More. Young Henry was fair Ellen's love, Young Emma to her heart was dear; Nor weal nor woe did Ellen prove, But Emma ever seemed to share. Yet envious still, she spread the wile That sullied Ellen's virtues o'er; Her faithless Henry spurned the while, His fair, his faithful Ellen More. She wandered down Loch-Mary side, Where oft at evening hour she stole, To meet her love with secret pride; Now deepest anguish wrung her soul. O'ercome with grief, she sought the steep Where Yarrow falls with sullen roar; Oh, Pity! veil thine eyes and weep! A bleeding corpse lies Ellen More. The sun may shine on Yarrow braes, And woo the mountain flowers to bloom, But never can his golden rays Awake the flower in yonder tomb. There oft young Henry strays forlorn, When moonlight gilds the abbey tower; There oft, from eve till breezy morn, He weeps his faithful Ellen More. THE SNOWSTORM. “Wild drives the bitter northern blast, Fierce whirling wide the crispy snaw, Young lassie, turn your wand'ring steps, For e'ening's gloom begins to fa': I 'll tak you to my faither's ha', And shield you frae the wintry air, For, wand'ring through the drifting snaw, I fear ye 'll sink to rise nae mair.” “Ah! gentle lady, airt my way Across this langsome, lanely moor, For he wha's dearest to my heart Now waits me on the western shore; Wi' morn he spreads his outward sail— This nicht I vow'd to meet him there, To tak' ae secret, fond fareweel, We maybe pairt to meet nae mair.” “Dear lassie, turn—'twill be your deid! The dreary waste lies far and wide; Abide till morn, and then ye 'll ha'e My faither's herdboy for your guide.” “Na, lady,—na! I maunna turn, Impatient love now chides my stay, Yon rising moon, wi' kindly beam, Will licht me on my weary way.” Ah! Donald, wherefore bounds thy heart? Why beams wi' joy thy wistfu' e'e? Yon's but thy true love's fleeting form, Thy true love mair thou'lt never see; Deep in the hollow glen she lies, Amang the snaw, beneath the tree, She soundly sleeps in death's cauld arms, A victim to her love for thee. WI' WAEFU' HEART. Wi' waefu' heart and sorrowing e'e I saw my Jamie sail awa'; Oh! 'twas a fatal day for me, That day he passed the Berwick Law. How joyless now seemed all behind! I, lingering, strayed along the shore; Dark boding fears hung on my mind That I might never see him more. That night came on with heavy rain, Loud, fierce, and wild the tempest blew; In mountains rolled the awful main: Ah, hapless maid! my fears how true! The landsmen heard their drowning cries, The wreck was seen with dawning day; My love was found, and now he lies Low in the isle of gloomy May. O boatman, kindly waft me o'er! The caverned rock shall be my home; 'Twill ease my burdened heart to pour Its sorrows o'er his grassy tomb; With sweetest flowers I 'll deck his grave, And tend them through the langsome year; I 'll water them, ilk morn and eve, With deepest sorrow's warmest tear. LONE SILENT GRAVE. Responsive, ye woods, wing your echoes along, Till nature, all sad, weeping, listen my song, Till flocks cease their bleating, and herds cease to low, And the clear winding rivulet scarce seems to flow. For fair was the flower that once gladden'd our plains, Sweet rosebud of virtue, adored by our swains; But Fate, like a blast from the chill wintry wave, Has laid my sweet flower in yon cold silent grave. Her warm feeling breast did with sympathy glow, In innocence pure as the new mountain snow; Her face was more fair than the mild apple-bloom; Her voice sweet as Hope, whisp'ring pleasures to come. Oh, Mary, my love! wilt thou never return? 'Tis thy William who calls—burst the bands of thine urn! Together we 'll wander—poor wretch, how I rave! My Mary lies low in the lone silent grave. Yon tall leafy planes throw a deep solemn shade O'er the dear holy spot where my Mary is laid, Lest the light wanton sunbeams obtrude on the gloom That lorn love and friendship have wove round her tomb. Still there let the mild tears of nature remain, Till calm dewy evening weep o'er her again; There oft I will wander—no boon now I crave, But to weep life away o'er her dark silent grave. MY MARY. My Mary is a bonnie lass, Sweet as the dewy morn, When Fancy turns her rural reed Beside the upland thorn. She lives ahint yon sunny knowe, Where flowers in wild profusion grow, Where spreading birks and hazels throw Their shadows o'er the burn. 'Tis not the streamlet-skirted wood, Wi' a' its leafy bowers, That gars me wait in solitude Among the wild-sprung flow'rs; But aft I cast a langing e'e, Down frae the bank, out-owre the lea, There, haply, I my lass may see, As through the broom she scours. Yestreen I met my bonnie lass Coming frae the town, We raptur'd sank in ither's arms, And prest the breckans down. The pairtrick sung his e'ening note, The ryecraik rispt his clam'rous throat, While there the heav'nly vow I got That arl't her my own. SING ON, THOU SWEET WARBLER. Sing on, thou sweet warbler, thy glad evening song, And charm the lone echoes the green woods among; As dear unto thee is the sun's setting beam, So dear unto me is the soul's melting dream. The dark winter frowning, all pleasure disowning, Shall strip thy green woods and be deaf to thy moaning; But dark stormy winter is yet far away, Then let us be glad, when all Nature is gay. OCH, HEY! JOHNNIE, LAD. Och, hey! Johnnie, lad, Ye 're no sae kind's ye should ha'e been; Och, hey! Johnnie, lad, Ye didna keep your tryst yestreen. I waited lang beside the wood, Sae wae and weary, a' my lane; Och, hey! Johnnie, lad, Ye 're no sae kind's ye should ha'e been. I looked by the whinnie knowe, I looked by the firs sae green, I looked owre the spunkie-howe, And aye I thought ye would ha'e been. The ne'er a supper cross'd my craig, The ne'er a sleep has clos'd my een; Och, hey! Johnnie, lad, Ye 're no sae kind's ye should ha'e been. Gin ye were waiting by the wood, Then I was waiting by the thorn; I thought it was the place we set, And waited maist till dawning morn. Sae be na vex'd, my bonnie lassie, Let my waiting stand for thine; We 'll awa' to Craigton-shaw, And seek the joys we tint yestreen. O ARE YE SLEEPIN', MAGGIE? “O are ye sleepin', Maggie? O are ye sleepin' Maggie? Let me in, for loud the linn Is roaring o'er the warlock craigie.” Mirk and rainy is the night, No a starn in a' the carry, Lightnings gleam athwart the lift, And winds drive wi' winter's fury. O are ye sleepin', Maggie? etc. Fearful soughs the boortree bank, The rifted wood roars wild and dreary, Loud the iron yett does clank, And cry of howlets makes me eerie. O are ye sleepin', Maggie? etc. Aboon my breath I daurna speak, For fear I rouse your waukrife daddie; Cauld's the blast upon my cheek, O rise, rise, my bonnie lady! O are ye sleepin', Maggie? etc. She ope'd the door, she let him in, He cuist aside his dreepin' plaidie: “Blaw your warst, ye rain and win', Since, Maggie, now I 'm in aside ye.” Now since your waukin', Maggie, Now since your waukin', Maggie, What care I for howlet's cry, For boortree bank, or warlock craigie. BONNIE FAIRED-HAIRED NANNIE. Full eighteen summers up life's brae I speeded on fu' canny, O, Till sleeky Love threw in my way Young bonnie fair-haired Nanny, O. I wooed her soon, I won her syne, Our vows o' love were many, O; And, oh! what happy days were mine Wi' bonnie faired-haired Nannie, O. BONNIE WINSOME MARY. Fortune, frowning most severe, Forced me from my native dwelling, Parting with my friends so dear Cost me many a bitter tear; But, like the clouds of early day, Soon my sorrows fled away, When, blooming sweet and smiling gay, I met my winsome Mary. Wha can sit with gloomy brow, Blest with sic a charming lassie? Native scenes, I think on you, Yet the change I canna rue. Wand'ring many a weary mile, Fortune seemed to lower the while, But now she 's gi'en me, for the toil, My bonnie winsome Mary. Though our riches are but few, Faithful love is aye a treasure; Ever cheery, kind, and true, Nane but her I e'er can lo'e. Hear me, a' ye powers above, Powers of sacred truth and love! While I live I 'll constant prove To my dear winsome Mary. YE WOOER LADS WHA GREET AND GRANE. Ye wooer lads wha greet and grane, Wha preach and fleech, and mak' a mane, An' pine yoursel's to skin and bane, Come a' to Callum Brogach. I 'll learn you here the only art To win a bonnie lassie's heart— Just tip wi' gowd Love's siller dart, Like dainty Callum Brogach. I ca'd her aye my sonsie doo, The fairest flower that e'er I knew; Yet, like a souple spankie grew, She fled frae Callum Brogach. But soon's she heard the guinea ring, She turn'd as I had been a king, Wi'—“Tak' my hand or ony thing, Dear, dainty Callum Brogach!” It 's gowd can mak' the blind to see, Can bring respect where nane wad be, And Cupid ne'er shall want his fee Frae dainty Callum Brogach. Nae mair wi' greetin' blin' your een, Nae mair wi' sighin' warm the win', But hire the gettlin for your frien', Like dainty Callum Brogach. MY DAYS HA'E FLOWN WI' GLEESOME SPEED. My days ha'e flown wi' gleesome speed, Grief ne'er sat heavy on my mind, Sae happy wi' my rural reed, I lilted every care behind. I 've been vext and sair perplext When friends prov'd false, or beauty shy; But, like good John o' Badenyon, I croon'd my lilt and car'd na by. I 'll HIE ME TO THE SHIELING HILL. I 'll hie me to the shieling hill, And bide amang the braes, Callum, Ere I gang to Crochan mill, I 'll live on hips and slaes, Callum. Wealthy pride but ill can hide Your runkl'd measled shins, Callum; Lyart pow, as white's the tow, And beard as rough's the whins, Callum. Wily woman aft deceives, Sae ye 'll think, I ween, Callum; Trees may keep their wither'd leaves Till ance they get the green, Callum. Blithe young Donald's won my heart, Has my willing vow, Callum; Now, for a' your couthy art, I winna marry you, Callum. WHEN JOHN AND I WERE MARRIED. When John and I were married, Our hauding was but sma', For my minnie, cankered carline, Would gi'e us nocht ava. I wair't my fee wi' canny care, As far as it would gae, But weel I wat our bridal bed Was clean pea-strae. Wi' working late and early, We 're come to what you see, For fortune thrave aneath our hands, Sae eident aye were we. The lowe of love made labour light, I 'm sure ye 'll find it sae, When kind ye cuddle down, at e'en, 'Mang clean pea-strae. The rose blooms gay on cairny brae, As weel's in birken shaw, And love will lowe in cottage low, As weel's in lofty ha': Sae, lassie, tak' the lad ye like, Whate'er your minnie say, Tho' ye should mak' your bridal bed Of clean pea-strae. THOUGH HUMBLE MY LOT. Where primroses spring on the green-tufted brae, And the rivulet runs murmuring below, Oh, fortune! at morning, or noon, let me stray, And thy wealth on thy votaries bestow: For, oh! how enraptured my bosom does glow As calmly I wander alone, Where wild woods, and bushes, and primroses grow, And a streamlet enlivens the scene. Though humble my lot, not ignoble's my state, Let me still be contented, though poor; What destiny brings, be resigned to my fate, Though misfortune should knock at my door. I care not for honour, preferment, nor wealth, Nor the titles that affluence yields, While blithely I roam, in the heyday of health, 'Midst the charms of my dear native fields. AND WERE YE AT DUNTOCHER BURN? And were ye at Duntocher burn? And did ye see them a', man? And how's my wifie and the bairns? I ha'e been lang awa', man. This hedger wark's a weary trade, It doesna suit ava, man; Wi' lanely house and lanely bed My comforts are but sma', man. And how's wee Sandy, Pate, and Tam? Sit down and tak' your blaw, man; Fey, lassie, rin, fetch in a dram, To treat my friend, John Lamon. For ilka plack ye 've gi'en to mine, Your callans shall get twa, man; O were my heels as light's my heart, I soon wad see them a', man. My blessing on her kindly heart, She likes to see me braw, man; She 's darned my hose, and bleached my sarks As white's the driven snaw, man. And ere the winds o' Martinmas Sough through the scroggie shaw, man, I 'll lift my weel-hain'd penny fee, And gang and see them a', man. MY HEART IS SAIR WI' HEAVY CARE. My heart is sair wi' heavy care, To think on friendship's fickle smile; It blinks a wee, wi' kindly e'e, When world's thrift runs weel the while. But let misfortune's tempests lower, It soon turns cauld, it soon turns sour; It looks sae high and scornfully, It winna ken a poor man's door. I ance had siller in my purse, I dealt it out right frank and free, And hoped, should fortune change her course, That they would do the same for me: But, weak in wit, I little thought That friendship's smiles were sold and bought, 'Till ance I saw, like April snaw, They waned awa' when I had nought. It 's no to see my threadbare coat, It 's no to see my coggie toom, It 's no to ware my hindmost groat, That gars me fret, and gars me gloom: But 'tis to see the scornful pride That honest poortith aft maun bide Frae selfish slaves, and sordid knaves, Wha strut with fortune on their side. But let it gang; what de'il care I! With eident thrift I 'll toil for mair; I 'll halve my mite with misery, But fient a ane of them shall share: With soul unbent I 'll stand the stour, And while they 're fluttering past my door, I 'll sing with glee, and let them see An honest heart can ne'er be poor. COMPANION OF MY YOUTHFUL SPORTS. Companion of my youthful sports, From love and friendship torn, A victim to the pride of courts, Thy early death I mourn. Unshrouded on a foreign shore, Thou 'rt mould'ring in the clay, While here thy weeping friends deplore Corunna's fatal day. How glows the youthful warrior's mind With thoughts of laurels won! But ruthless ruin lurks behind, “And marks him for her own.” How soon the meteor ray is shed, “That lures him to his doom,” And dark oblivion veils his head In everlasting gloom! DAVIE TULLOCH'S BONNIE KATIE. Davie Tulloch's bonnie Katie, Davie's bonnie blithesome Katie, Tam the laird cam' down yestreen, He sought her love, but gat her pity. Wi' trembling grip he squeezed her hand, While his auld heart gaed pitty-patty; Aye he thought his gear and land Wad win the love o' bonnie Katie. Davie Tulloch's bonnie Katie, Davie's bonnie blithesome Katie, Aye she smiled as Tammie wiled: Her smile was scorn, yet mixed wi' pity. DESPAIRING MARY. “Mary, why thus waste thy youth-time in sorrow? See a' around you the flowers sweetly blaw; Blithe sets the sun o'er the wild cliffs of Jura, Blithe sings the mavis in ilka green shaw!” “How can this heart ever mair think of pleasure? Simmer may smile, but delight I ha'e nane; Cauld in the grave lies my heart's only treasure, Nature seems dead since my Jamie is gane. “This kerchief he gave me, a true lover's token; Dear, dear to me was the gift for his sake! I wear't near my heart, but this poor heart is broken; Hope died with Jamie, and left it to break. Sighing for him, I lie down in the e'ening, Sighing for him, I awake in the morn; Spent are my days a' in secret repining, Peace to this bosom can never return. “Oft have we wandered in sweetest retirement, Telling our loves 'neath the moon's silent beam; Sweet were our meetings of tender endearment, But fled are these joys like a fleet-passing dream. Cruel remembrance, ah! why wilt thou wreck me? Brooding o'er joys that for ever are flown; Cruel remembrance, in pity forsake me, Flee to some bosom where grief is unknown!” O HOW CAN YOU GANG, LASSIE! O how can you gang, lassie, how can you gang, O how can you gang sae to grieve me! Wi' your beauty, and your art, ye ha'e broken my heart, For I never, never dreamt ye would leave me. O SAIR I RUE THE WITLESS WISH. O sair I rue the witless wish, That gar'd me gang wi' you at e'en, And sair I rue the birken bush, That screen'd us wi' its leaves sae green. And though ye vow'd ye wad be mine, The tear o' grief aye dims my e'e; For O! I 'm fear'd that I may tine The love that ye ha'e promised me! While ithers seek their e'ening sports, I wander, dowie, a' my lane, For when I join their glad resorts, Their daffing gi'es me meikle pain. Alas! it wasna sae shortsyne, When a' my nights were spent wi' glee; But, O! I 'm fear'd that I may tine The love that ye ha'e promised me. Dear lassie, keep thy heart aboon, For I ha'e wair'd my winter's fee, I 've coft a bonnie silken gown, To be a bridal gift for thee. And sooner shall the hills fa' down, And mountain-high shall stand the sea, Ere I 'd accept a gowden crown, To change that love I bear for thee. THE NEGRO GIRL. Yon poor Negro girl, an exotic plant, Was torn from her dear native soil, Reluctantly borne o'er the raging Atlant, Then brought to Britannia's isle. Tho' Fatima's mistress be loving and kind, Poor Fatima still must deplore; She thinks on her parents, left weeping behind, And sighs for her dear native shore. She thinks on her Zadi, the youth of her heart, Who from childhood was loving and true; How he cried on the beach, when the ship did depart! 'Twas a sad everlasting adieu. The shell-woven gift which he bound round her arm The rude seaman unfeelingly tore, Nor left one sad relic her sorrows to charm, When far from her dear native shore. And now, all dejected, she wanders apart, No friend, save retirement, she seeks; The sigh of despondency bursts from her heart, And tears dew her thin sable cheeks. Poor hard-fated girl, long, long she may mourn! Life's pleasures to her are all o'er; Far fled ev'ry hope that she e'er shall return To revisit her dear native shore. THE LASSIE O' MERRY EIGHTEEN. My father would ha'e me to marry the miller, My mither would ha'e me to marry the laird, But brawly I ken it 's the love o' the siller That brightens their fancy to ony regard. The miller is crookit, the miller is crabbit, The laird, though he 's wealthy, he 's lyart and lean; He 's auld, and he 's cauld, an' he 's blin' an' he 's bald, An' he 's no for a lassie o' merry eighteen. MARJORIE MILLER. Louder than the trump of fame Is the voice of Marjorie Miller; Time, the wildest beast can tame, She 's eternally the same: Loud the mill's incessant clack, Loud the clank of Vulcan's hammer, Loud the deep-mouth'd cataract, But louder far her dinsome clamour! Nought on earth can equal be To the noise of Marjorie. Calm succeeds the tempest's roar, Peace does follow war's confusion; Dogs do bark and soon give o'er, But she barks for evermore. Loud's the sounding bleachfield horn, But her voice is ten times louder! Red's the sun on winter morn, But her face is ten times redder! She delights in endless strife: Lord! preserve's from such a wife! The attribution of this poem is questionable. KISS'D YESTREEN. It is doubtful if Tannahill was the author of more than the first verse of this song. The lasses a' laughed, an' the carlin flate, But Maggie was sitting fu' ourie an' blate; The auld silly gawkie, she couldna contain, How brawly she was kiss'd yestreen, Kiss'd yestreen, kiss'd yestreen, How brawly she was kiss'd yestreen: She blether'd it round to her fae an' her frien', How brawly she was kiss'd yestreen. [She loosed the white napkin frae 'bout her dun neck, And cried—“The big sorrow tak' lang Geordie Fleck! D'ye see what a scart I gat frae a preen, By his touslin' and kissin' at me yestreen, At me yestreen, at me yestreen, By his touslin' and kissin' at me yestreen: I canna conceive what the fallow could mean By kissin' sae meikle at me yestreen.” Then she pu'd up her sleeve, and showed a blae mark, Quoth she—“I gat that frae young Davie, our clerk; But the creature had surely forgat himsel' clean, When he nipped me sae hard for a kiss yestreen, For a kiss yestreen, for a kiss yestreen, When he nipped me sae hard for a kiss yestreen: I wonder what keepit my nails frae his een, When he nipped me sae hard for a kiss yestreen.” Then she held up her cheek, and cried—“Foul fa' the laird, Just look what I gat wi' his black birsie beard! The vile filthy body! was e'er the like seen? Tae rub me sae sair for a kiss yestreen, For a kiss yestreen, for a kiss yestreen, To rub me sae sair for a kiss yestreen: I 'm sure that nae woman o' judgment need grien To be rubbed, like me, for a kiss yestreen.” Syne she told what grand offers she aften had had, But, wad she tak' a man? na, she wasna sae mad! For the whole o' the sex she cared no a preen, And she hated the way she was kiss'd yestreen, She was kiss'd yestreen, she was kiss'd yestreen, And she hated the way she was kiss'd yestreen: 'Twas a mercy that naething mair serious had been, For it 's dangerous, whiles, to be kiss'd at e'en.] HEY, DONALD! HOW, DONALD! Additional verses by Motherwell. Though simmer smiles on bank and brae, And nature bids the heart be gay, Yet a' the joys o' flowery May Wi' pleasure ne'er can move me. Hey, Donald! how, Donald! Think upon your vow, Donald! Mind the heathery knowe, Donald! Where ye vowed to lo'e me. [The budding rose and scented brier, The siller fountain skinkling clear, The merry lav'rock whistling near, Wi' pleasure ne'er can move me. Hey, Donald! etc. I downa look on bank and brae, I downa greet where a' are gay, But O! my heart will break wi' wae, Gin Donald cease to lo'e me. Hey, Donald! etc.] I 'll LAY ME ON THE WINTRY LEA. I 'll lay me on the wintry lea, And sleep amidst the wind and weet, And ere another's bride I be, O bring to me my winding sheet! What can a hapless lassie do, When ilka friend wad prove her foe, Wad gar her break her dearest vow, To wed wi' ane she canna lo'e? THE MANIAC'S SONG. Hark! 'tis the poor maniac's song: She sits on yon wild craggy steep, And while the winds mournfully whistle along, She wistfully looks o'er the deep: And aye she sings, “Lullaby, lullaby, lullaby!” To hush the rude billows asleep. She looks to yon rock far at sea, And thinks it her lover's white sail, The warm tear of joy glads her wild glist'ning eye, As she beckons his vessel to hail: And aye she sings, “Lullaby, lullaby, lullaby!” And frets at the boisterous gale. Poor Susan was gentle and fair, Till the seas robbed her heart of its joy; Then her reason was lost in the gloom of despair, And her charms then did wither and die: And now her sad “Lullaby, lullaby, lullaby!” Oft wakes the lone passenger's sigh. AWAY, GLOOMY CARE. Away, gloomy care, there 's no place for thee here, Where so many good fellows are met; Thou wouldst dun the poor bard every day in the year, Yet I 'm sure I am none in thy debt. Go, soak thy old skin in the miser's small beer, And keep watch in his cell all the night; And if in the morning thou dar'st to appear, By Jove, I shall drown thee outright. MEG O' THE GLEN. Meg o' the glen set aff to the fair, Wi' ruffles an' ribbons, an' meikle prepare; Her heart it was heavy, her head it was licht, For a' the lang way, for a wooer she sicht. She spak' to the lads, but the lads slippet by; She spak' to the lasses, the lasses were shy; She thocht she might do, but she didna weel ken, For nane seem'd to care for poor Meg o' the Glen. THE FIVE FRIENDS. Weel, wha's in the bouroch, and what is your cheer? The best that ye 'll find in a thousand year. And we 're a' noddin', nid, nid, noddin', We 're a' noddin' fu' at e'en. There 's our ain Jamie Clark, frae the hall of Argyle, Wi' his leal Scottish heart, and his kind open smile. And we 're a' noddin', nid, nid, noddin', We 're a' noddin' fu' at e'en. There is Will, the gude fallow, wha kills a' our care Wi' his sang an' his joke—and a mutchkin mair. And we 're a' noddin', nid, nid, noddin', We 're a' noddin' fu' at e'en. There is blithe Jamie Barr, frae St. Barchan's toun, When wit gets a kingdom, he 's sure o' the croun. And we 're a' noddin', nid, nid, noddin', We 're a' noddin' fu' at e'en. There is Rab, frae the south, wi' his fiddle and his flute, I could list to his strains till the starns fa' out. And we 're a' noddin', nid, nid, noddin', We 're a' noddin' fu' at e'en. Apollo, for our comfort, has furnished the bowl, And here is my bardship as blind as an owl. For we 're a' noddin', nid, nid, noddin', We 're a' noddin' fu' at e'en. FILL, FILL THE MERRY BOWL. Fill, fill the merry bowl, Drown corrosive care and sorrow, Why, why clog the soul By caring for to-morrow? Fill your glasses, toast your lasses, Blithe Anacreon bids you live; Love with friendship far surpasses All the pleasures life can give. Ring, ring th' enlivening bell, The merry dirge of care and sorrow, Why leave them life to tell Their heavy tales to-morrow? Come, join the social glee, Give the reins to festive pleasure; While fancy, light and free, Dances to the measure. Love and wit, with all the graces, Revel round in fairy ring; Smiling joy adorns our faces, While with jocund hearts we sing. Now, since our cares are drowned, Spite of what the sages tell us, Hoary Time, in all his round, Ne'er saw such happy fellows. WHY UNITE TO BANISH CARE? Why unite to banish care? Let him come our joys to share; Doubly blest our cup shall flow When it soothes a brother's woe; 'Twas for this the powers divine Crowned our board with generous wine. Far be hence the sordid elf Who'd claim enjoyment for himself; Come, the hardy seaman, lame, The gallant soldier, robbed of fame; Welcome all who bear the woes Of various kind that merit knows. Patriot heroes, doomed to sigh, Idle 'neath corruption's eye; Honest tradesmen, credit-worn, Pining under fortune's scorn; Wanting wealth, or lacking fame, Welcome all that worth can claim. Come, the hoary-headed sage, Suffering more from want than age; Come, the proud, though needy bard, Starving midst a world's regard: Welcome, welcome, one and all That feel on this unfeeling ball. COGGIE, THOU HEALS ME. Dorothy sits i' the cauld ingle neuk: Her red rosy neb's like a labster tae; Wi' girning, her mou's like the gab o' the fleuk, Wi' smoking, her teeth 's like the jet o' the slae. And aye she sings “Weel 's me!” aye she sings “Weel 's me! Coggie, thou heals me! coggie, thou heals me! Aye my best friend when there 's onything ails me: Ne'er shall we part till the day that I dee.” Dorothy ance was a weel-tocher'd lass, Had charms like her neighbours, and lovers enou', But she spited them sae, wi' her pride and her sauce, They left her for thirty lang simmers to rue. Then aye she sang “Wae's me!” aye she sang “Wae's me! O I 'll turn crazy! O I 'll turn crazy! Naething in a' the wide world can ease me; De'il take the wooers—O what shall I do?” Dorothy, dozen'd wi' living her lane, Pu'd at her rock, wi' the tear in her e'e; She thought on the braw merry days that were gane, And caft a wee coggie for company. Now aye she sings “Weel's me!” aye she sings “Weel's me! Coggie, thou heals me! coggie, thou heals me! Aye my best friend when there 's onything ails me: Ne'er shall we part till the day that I dee.” THE BANKS OF SPEY. Scenes of my childhood, your wanderer hails you, Winged with rude storm, though the winter assails you; Bleak and dreary as ye are, ye yet have charms to cheer me, For here, amidst my native hills, my bonnie lassie's near me. 'Tis sad to see the wither'd lea, the drumly flooded fountain, The angry storm in awful form, that sweeps the moor and mountain; But from the surly swelling blast, dear lassie, I 'll defend her, And from the bonnie banks o' Spey I never more shall wander. COME HAME TO YOUR LINGELS. The bracketed portion by Alexander Rodger. “Come hame to your lingels, you ne'er-do-weel loon, You're the king of the dyvours, the talk of the town; Sae soon as the Munonday morning comes in, Your wearifu' daidling again maun begin.” “Gudewife, ye 're a skillet, your tongue's just a bell, To the peace o' guid fallows it rings the death-knell; But clack till ye deafen auld Barnaby's mill, The souter shall aye ha'e his Munonday's yill.” [“Come hame to your lapstane, come hame to your last, It 's a bonnie affair that your family maun fast, While you and your crew here a-drinking maun sit, Ye dazed, drunken, guid-for-nocht heir o' the pit: Just look, how I 'm gaun without stocking or shoe, Your bairns a' in tatters, and faitherless too, And yet, quite content, like a sot, ye 'll sit still, Till your kyte 's like to crack, wi' your Munonday's yill.” “I tell you, guidwife, gin ye haudna your clack, I 'll lend you a reistle wi' this owre your back; Maun we be abused and affronted by you Wi' siccan foul names as loon, dyvour, and crew?” “Come hame to your lingels, this instant come hame, Or I 'll redden your face, gin ye 've yet ony shame; For I 'll bring a' the bairns, and we 'll just ha'e our fill, As weel as yoursel', o' your Munonday's yill.” “Gin that be the gait o't, sirs, come let us stir, What need we sit here to be pestered by her? For she 'll plague and affront us as far as she can: Did ever a woman sae bother a man? Frae yill-house to yill-house she 'll after us rin, And raise the hail toun wi' her yelpin' and din; Come! ca' the guidwife, bid her bring in the bill: I see I maun quat takin' Munonday's yill.” —A. R.] THE HIGHLANDER'S INVITATION. Will you come to the board I 've prepared for you? Your drink shall be good, of the true Highland blue. Will you, Donald, will you, Callum, come to the board? There each shall be great as her own native lord. There'll be plenty of pipe, and a glorious supply Of the good sneesh-te-bacht, and the fine cut-and-dry. Will you, Donald, will you, Callum, come then at e'en? There be some for the stranger, but more for the frien'. There we 'll drink foggy care to his gloomy abodes, And we 'll smoke till we sit in the clouds like the gods. Will you, Donald, will you, Callum, won't you do so? 'Tis the way that our forefathers did long ago. And we 'll drink to the Cameron, we 'll drink to Lochiel, And, for Charlie, we 'll drink all the French to the de'il. Will you, Donald, will you, Callum, drink there until There be heads lie like peats, if hersel' had her will! There be groats on the land, there be fish in the sea, And there 's fouth in the coggie for friendship and me. Come then, Donald, come then, Callum, come then to-night, Sure the Highlander be first in the fuddle and the fight. THE COGGIE. When poortith cauld, and sour disdain, Hang owre life's vale sae foggie, The sun that brightens up the scene Is friendship's kindly coggie! Then, O revere the coggie, sirs! The friendly, social coggie! It gars the wheels of life rin light, Though e'er sae doilt and cloggie. Let pride in fortune's chariot fly, Sae empty, vain, and vogie; The source of wit, the spring of joy, Lies in the social coggie! Then, O revere the coggie, sirs! The independent coggie! And never snool beneath the frown Of ony selfish roguie. Poor modest worth, with cheerless e'e, Sits hurkling in the boggie, Till she asserts her dignity By virtue of the coggie! Then, O revere the coggie, sirs! The poor man's patron coggie! It warsels care, it fights life's faughts, And lifts him frae the boggie. Gi'e feckless Spain her weak snail broo, Gi'e France her weel spic'd froggie, Gi'e brother John his luncheon too, But gi'e to us our coggie! Then, O revere the coggie, sirs! Our soul-warm kindred coggie! Hearts doubly knit in social tie, When just a wee thought groggie. In days of yore our sturdy sires, Upon their hills sae scroggie, Glow'd with true freedom's warmest fires, And fought to save their coggie! Then, O revere the coggie, sirs! Our brave forefathers' coggie! It rous'd them up to doughty deeds, O'er which we 'll lang be vogie. Then, here's—may Scotland ne'er fa' doun, A cringing coward doggie, But bauldly stand, and bang the loon Wha'd reave her of her coggie! Then, O protect the coggie, sirs! Our gude auld mither's coggie! Nor let her luggie e'er be drain'd By ony foreign roguie. FLY WE TO SOME DESERT ISLE. Fly we to some desert isle, There we 'll pass our days together, Shun the world's derisive smile, Wand'ring tenants of the heather; Sheltered in some lonely glen, Far removed from mortal ken, Forget the selfish ways o' men, Nor feel a wish beyond each other. Though my friends deride me still, Jamie, I 'll disown thee never; Let them scorn me as they will, I 'll be thine—and thine for ever! What are a' my kin to me, A' their pride o' pedigree? What were life, if wanting thee, And what were death, if we maun sever! AMANG THE LOMOND BRAES. “Oh! lassie, wilt thou gang To the Lomond wi' me, The wild thyme 's in bloom, And the flower 's on the lea? Wilt thou gang, my dearest love? I will ever constant prove; I 'll range each hill and grove On the Lomond wi' thee.” “Oh! young men are fickle, Nor trusted to be, And many a native gem Shines fair on the lea: Thou may see some lovely flower Of a more attractive power, And may take her to thy bower On the Lomond wi' thee.” “The hind shall forsake, On the mountain, the doe; The stream of the fountain Shall cease for to flow: Ben Lomond shall bend His high brow to the sea Ere I take to my bower Any flower, love, but thee.” She 's taken her mantle; He 's taken his plaid; He 's caft her a ring, And he 's made her his bride: They 're far o'er the hills To spend their happy days, And range the woody glens Amang the Lomond braes. BONNIE HIELAN' LADDIE. Will ye gang to Inverness, Bonnie laddie, Hielan' laddie? There ye 'll see the Hielan' dress, Bonnie laddie, Hielan' laddie. Philabeg and bonnet blue, Bonnie laddie, Hielan' laddie, For the lad that wears the trew, Bonnie laddie, Hielan' laddie. Geordie sits in Charlie's chair, Bonnie laddie, Hielan' laddie; Had I my will he 'd no' sit there, Bonnie laddie, Hielan' laddie. Ne'er reflect on sorrows past, Bonnie laddie, Hielan' laddie, Charlie will be king at last, Bonnie laddie, Hielan' laddie. An' tho' now our sky may lower, Bonnie laddie, Hielan' laddie, It 's only like an April shower, Bonnie laddie, Hielan' laddie. Time an' tide come roun' to a', Bonnie laddie, Hielan' laddie, An' upstart pride will get a fa', Bonnie laddie, Hielan' laddie. Keep up your heart for Charlie's fight, Bonnie laddie, Hielan' laddie; An' come what may, ye 've done what 's right, Bonnie laddie, Hielan' laddie. WILL YE GANG TO SHERRAMUIR? Will ye gang to Sherramuir, Baul' John o' Innisture, There to see the noble Mar An' his Hielan' laddies? A' the true men o' the north, Angus, Huntly, and Seaforth, Scouring on to cross the Forth, Wi' their white cockadies! Will ye gang to Sherramuir, Baul' John o' Innisture There to see the noble Mar An' his Hielan' laddies? There, you 'll see the banners flare; There, you 'll hear the bagpipes rair, An' the trumpet's deadly blare, Wi' the cannon's rattle! There, you 'll see the baul' M'Craws, Cameron's and Clanronald's raws; An' a' the clans, wi' loud huzzas, Rushing to the battle. Will ye gang, etc. [There, you 'll see the noble Whigs, It is doubtful if Tannahill was the author of the last two verses. A' the heroes o' the brigs, Raw hides and withered wigs, Riding in array, man. Riven hose and raggit hools, Sour milk and girnin' gools, Psalm-beuks and cutty stools, We 'll see never mair, man. Will ye gang, etc. Will ye gang to Sherramuir, Baul' John o' Innisture? Sic a day, and sic an hour, Ne 'er was in the north, man. Siccan sights will ne 'er be seen! An' gin some be nae mista'en, Fragrant gales will come bedeen Frae the water o' Forth, man. Will ye gang, etc.] MY AIN KIND DEARIE, O. When I the dreary mountains passed, My ain kind dearie, O, I thought on thee, my bonnie lass, Although I wasna near thee, O. My heart within me was richt sad, When ithers they were cheerie, O; They little kent I thought on thee, My ain kind dearie, O. But now an' I ha'e won till Ayr, Although I 'm gae an' weary, O, I 'll take a glass into my hand, An' drink to you, my dearie, O. Cheer up your heart, my bonnie lass, An' see you dinna weary, O; In twice three weeks, gin I be spared, I 'se come again an' see thee, O, An' row thee up, an' row thee down, An' row till I weary, O, An' row thee o'er the lea rig, My ain kind dearie, O! CALLER HERRIN'. “Ah, feechanie! they 're no' for me! Guidwife, your herrin 's stinkin'; O sic a smell! just fin' yoursel', I weel could ken them winkin'.” “The deevil dance your lady gab! Gae doun the close, ye dirty drab! They 're caller fish, as ane can wish; She needna miss a dainty dish,— But, barmy jade! she 's winkin'.” “How daur you trow that I am fou, Ye flounder-gabbit gipsy! Set doun your creel, I 'll gar you feel I 'm neither fou nor tipsy.” “Gude trouth! if I my creel set doun, I 'll wad my life to hauf-a-croun I 'll gar ye yelp, like ony whelp, And cry for help, wi' skelp on skelp,— I 'll gi'e her hipsey-dixey!” [“Ye 'd talk to me like that, ye drab, And glare wi' sic an e'e;] To fyle my han's wi' sic as ye,— Gude feth! I 'll ne'er bemean me.” “Weel, honest folks, a' this ye hear? It 's mair than flesh an' blood can bear. I 'll tell you what, ye birsie cat! Tak' that, an' that, for a' your chat; Now, tell what I ha'e gi'en ye!” WE 'LL O'ER THE BRAES O' YARROW. The sun, just glancing through the trees, Gave light and joy to ilka grove, And pleasure in each southern breeze Awakened hope and slumbering love, When Jenny sung wi' hearty glee, To charm her winsome marrow,— “My bonnie laddie, gang wi' me, We 'll o'er the braes o' Yarrow.” Young Sandy was the blithest swain That ever piped on broomy brae, Nae lass could ken him free frae pain, Sae gracefu', kind, sae fair and gay; When Jenny sung wi' hearty glee, etc. He kiss'd and lov'd the bonnie maid, Her sparkling een had won his heart; Nae lass the youth had e'er betrayed, Nae fear had she, the lad nae art. And Jenny sung wi' hearty glee, etc. AWAKE, MY HARP, THE CHEERFUL STRAIN. Tannahill wrote several pieces to Irish airs, of which this and the succeeding songs are an example. Awake, my harp, the cheerful strain! Shall I, the first of Erin's warrior band, In wasting sorrow still complain? The first to dare stern danger's bloody field, Shall I to silly, changeful woman yield? No,—raise, my harp, the cheerful strain, What is a rosy cheek, or lily hand! Since thus she scorns, I 'll scorn again. AH! SHEELAH, THOU 'RT MY DARLING. Ah! Sheelah, thou 'rt my darling, The golden image of my heart; How cheerless seems this morning, It brings the hour when we must part. Though doomed to cross the ocean, And face the proud insulting foe, Thou hast my soul's devotion, My heart is thine where'er I go! Ah! Sheelah, thou 'rt my darling, My heart is thine where'er I go! When tossed upon the billow, And angry tempests round me blow, Let not the gloomy willow O'ershade thy lovely lily brow; But mind the seaman's story, Sweet William and his charming Sue; I 'll soon return with glory, And, like sweet William, wed thee too. Ah! Sheelah, thou 'rt my darling, My heart is thine where 'er I go! Think on our days of pleasure, While wand'ring by the Shannon side, When summer days gave leisure To stray amidst their flow'ry pride; And while thy faithful lover Is far upon the stormy main, Think, when the wars are over, These golden days shall come again. Ah! Sheelah thou 'rt my darling, These golden days shall come again! Farewell, ye lofty mountains, Your flow'ry wilds we wont to rove; Ye woody glens and fountains, The dear retreats of mutual love. Alas! we now must sever: O Sheelah, to thy vows be true! My heart is thine for ever; One fond embrace, and then adieu! Ah! Sheelah, thou 'rt my darling, One fond embrace, and then adieu! MOLLY, MY DEAR. The harvest is o'er, and the lads are so funny, Their hearts lined with love, and their pockets with money; From morning till night 'tis, “My jewel, my honey, Och, go to the north with me, Molly, my dear!” Young Dermot holds on with his sweet botheration, And swears there is only one flower in the nation; “Thou rose of the Shannon, thou pink of creation, Och, go to the north with me, Molly, my dear!” “The sun courts thy smiles as he sinks in the ocean, The moon to thy charms veils her face in devotion; And I, my poor self, och! so rich is my notion, Would pay down the world for sweet Molly, my dear!” Though Thady can match all the lads with his blarney, And sings me love-songs of the lakes of Killarney, In worth from my Dermot he 's twenty miles journey: My heart bids me tell him I 'll ne'er be his dear. IRISH TEACHING. Dear Judy, I 've taken a-thinking, The children their letters must learn, And we 'll send for old Father O'Jenkin To teach them three months in the barn; For learning 's the way to promotion, 'Tis culture brings food from the sod, And books give a fellow a notion How matters are doing abroad. Though father neglected my reading, Kind soul! sure his spirit 's in rest! For the very first part of his breeding Was still to relieve the distrest: And late, when the trav'ller benighted Besought hospitality's claim, He lodged him till morning, delighted, Because 'twas a lesson to them. The man that won't feel for another Is just like a colt on the moor, He lives without knowing a brother, To frighten bad luck from his door. But he that 's kind-hearted and steady, Though wintry misfortune should come, He 'll still find some friend who is ready To scare the old witch from his home. Success to Ould Ireland for ever! 'Tis just the dear land to my mind; Her lads are warm-hearted and clever, Her girls are all handsome and kind; And he that her name would bespatter, By wishing the French safely o'er, May the de'il blow him over the water, And make him cook frogs for the core! KITTY TYRELL. The breeze of the night fans the dark mountain's breast, And the light bounding deer have all sunk to their rest; The big sullen waves lash the lough's rocky shore, And the lone drowsy fisherman nods o'er his oar. Though pathless the moor, and though starless the skies, The star of my heart is my Kitty's bright eyes; And joyful I hie over glen, brake, and fell, In secret to meet my sweet Kitty Tyrell. Ah! long have we loved in her father's despite, And oft we have met at the dead hour of night, When hard-hearted Vigilance, sunk in repose, Gave Love one sweet hour its fond tale to disclose. These moments of transport, to me, oh how dear! And the fate that would part us, alas, how severe! Although the rude storm rise with merciless swell, This night I shall meet my sweet Kitty Tyrell. “Ah! turn, hapless youth! see the dark cloud of death Comes rolling in gloom o'er the wild haunted heath; Deep groans the scathed oak on the glen's cliffy brow, And the sound of the torrent seems heavy with woe.” Away, foolish seer, with thy fancies so wild, Go, tell thy weak dreams to some credulous child; Love guides my light steps through the lone dreary dell, And I fly to the arms of sweet Kitty Tyrell. THE DIRGE OF CAROLAN. “Ye maids of green Erin, why sigh ye so sad? The summer is smiling, all nature is glad.” The summer may smile, and the shamrock may bloom, But the pride of green Erin lies cold in the tomb; And his merits demand all the tears that we shed, Though they ne'er can awaken the slumbering dead: Yet still they shall flow—for dear Carolan we mourn, For the soul of sweet music now sleeps in his urn. Ye bards of our isle, join our grief with your songs, For the deepest regret to our memory belongs; In our cabins and fields, on our mountains and plains, How oft have we sung to his heart-melting strains. Ah! these strains shall survive, long as time they shall last, Yet they now but remind us of joys that are past: And our days, crowned with pleasure, can never return, For the soul of sweet music now sleeps in his urn. Yes, thou pride of green Erin, thy honours thou'lt have, Seven days, seven nights, we shall weep round thy grave; And thy harp, that so oft to our ditties has rung, To the lorn-sighing breeze o'er thy grave shall be hung; And the song shall ascend, thy bright worth to proclaim, That the shade may rejoice in the voice of thy fame: But our days, crowned with pleasure, can never return, For the soul of sweet music now sleeps in thine urn. PEGGY O'RAFFERTY. O could I fly like the green-coated fairy, I 'd skip o'er the ocean to dear Tipperary, Where all the young fellows are blithesome and merry, While here I lament my sweet Peggy O'Rafferty. How could I bear in my bosom to leave her, In absence I think her more lovely than ever; With thoughts of her beauty I 'm all in a fever, Since others may woo my sweet Peggy O'Rafferty. Scotland, thy lasses are modest and bonny, But here every Jenny has got her own Johnny, And though I might call them my jewel and honey, My heart is at home with sweet Peggy O'Rafferty. Wistful I think on my dear native mountains, Their green shady glens, and their crystalline fountains, And ceaseless I heave the deep sigh of repentance, That ever I left my sweet Peggy O'Rafferty. Fortune, 'twas thine all the light foolish notion That led me to rove o'er the wild-rolling ocean; But what now to me all my hopes of promotion, Since I am so far from sweet Peggy O'Rafferty. Grant me as many thirteens as will carry me Down through the country, and over the ferry, I 'll hie me straight home into dear Tipperary, And never more leave my sweet Peggy O'Rafferty. THE POOR MAN'S LAMENT FOR THE DEATH OF HIS COW. How gay rose this morning, how cheerful was I, No care on my mind, and no cloud on the sky; I dreamt not ere night that my sorrows should flow, Bewailing the fate of my poor drimindo. Drimindu—a name for a cow. YE FRIENDLY STARS. Ye friendly stars that rule the night, And hail my glad returning, Ye never shone so sweetly bright Since gay St. Patrick's morning. My life hung heavy on my mind, Despair sat brooding o'er me; Now all my cares are far behind, And joy is full before me. Gamby ora! Gamby ora! How my heart approves me! Gamby ora! Gamby ora! Kathleen owns she loves me! Were all the flow'ry pastures mine That deck fair Limerick county, That wealth, dear Kathleen, should be thine, And all should share our bounty. But fortune's gifts I value not, Nor grandeur's highest station; I would not change my happy lot For all the Irish nation. Gamby ora! Gamby ora! How my heart approves me! Gamby ora! Gamby ora! Kathleen owns she loves me! GREEN INISMORE. How light is my heart as I journey along, Now my perilous service is o'er! I think on sweet home, and I carol a song In remembrance of her I adore. How sad was the hour when I bade her adieu! Her tears spoke her grief, though her words were but few; She hung on my bosom, and sighed, O be true, When you're far from the green Inismore. Ah! Eveleen, my love! hadst thou seen this fond breast, How, at parting, it bled to its core, Thou hadst there seen thine image so deeply imprest, That thou ne'er couldst have doubted me more. For my king and my country undaunted I fought, And braved all the hardships of war as I ought, But the day never rose saw thee strange to my thought, Since I left thee in green Inismore. Ye dear native mountains that tower on my view, What joys to my mind ye restore! The past happy scenes of my life ye renew, And ye ne'er seemed so charming before. In the rapture of fancy already I spy My kindred and friends crowding round me with joy; But my Eveleen, sweet girl, there 's a far dearer tie Binds this heart to the green Inismore. KITTY O'CARROL. Ye may boast of your charms, and be proud, to be sure, As if there was never such beauty before; But ere I got wedded to old Thady More, I had dozens of wooers each night at my door, With their “Och dear! O will you marry me, Kitty O'Carrol, the joy of my soul!” THE IRISH FARMER. Dear Judy, when first we got married, Our fortune indeed was but small, For save the light hearts that we carried, Our riches were nothing at all. I sung while I reared up the cabin, Ye powers, give me vigour and health! And a truce to all sighing and sobbing, For love is Pat Mulligan's wealth. Through summer and winter so dreary, I cheerily toiled on the farm, Nor ever once dreamed growing weary, For love gave my labour its charm. And now, though 'tis weak to be vaunty, Yet here let us gratefully own, We live amidst pleasure and plenty, As happy 's the king on the throne. We 've Murdoch, and Patrick, and Connor, As fine little lads as you 'll see; And Kitty, sweet girl, 'pon my honour, She 's just the dear picture of thee. Though some folks may still underrate us, Ah! why should we mind them a fig? We 've a large swinging field of potatoes, A good drimindu A cow. and a pig. SWEET KITTY MORE. One night in my youth as I rov'd with my merry pipe, List'ning the echoes that rang to the tune, I met Kitty More, with her two lips so cherry-ripe, “Phelim,” says she, “give us ‘Elleen Aroon!’” Dear Kitty, says I, thou 'rt so charmingly free! Now, if you wilt deign thy sweet voice to the measure, 'Twill make all the echoes run giddy with pleasure, For none in fair Erin can sing it like thee. My chanter I plied, with my heart beating gaily, I pip'd up the strain, while so sweetly she sang; The soft melting melody filled all the valley, The green woods around us in harmony rang. Methought that she verily charmed up the moon! And now, as I wander in village or city, When good people call for some favourite ditty, I give them sweet Kitty, and “Elleen Aroon.” ADIEU, SWEET ERIN. Adieu! ye cheerful native plains, Dungeon glooms receive me, Nought, alas! for me remains, Of all the joys ye gave me— All are flown! Banished from thy shores, sweet Erin, I through life must toil, despairing, Lost and unknown. Howl, ye winds! around my cell, Nothing now can wound me; Mingling with your dreary swell, Prison groans surround me: Bodings wild! Treachery, thy ruthless doing, Long I 'll mourn in hopeless ruin, Lost and exiled!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BURNS ANNIVERSARY ODES, ETC., BY TANNAHILL. ODE. BURNS ANNIVERSARY MEETING. Written for, and read at the Celebration of, Robert Burns' Birthday, Paisley, 1805. Once on a time, almighty Jove Invited all the minor gods above To spend one day in social festive pleasure; His regal robes were laid aside, His crown, his sceptre, and his pride; And, wing'd with joy, The hours did fly, The happiest ever Time did measure. Of love and social harmony they sung, Till Heav'n's high golden arches echoing rung; And as they quaffed the nectar-flowing can, Their toast was— “Universal peace 'twixt man and man.” Their godships' eyes beam'd gladness with the wish, And Mars half reddened with a guilty blush; Jove swore he 'd hurl each rascal to perdition Who 'd dare deface his works with wild ambition; But pour'd encomiums on each patriot band, Who, hating conquest, guard their native land. Loud, thund'ring plaudits shook the bright abodes, Till Merc'ry, solemn-voiced, assail'd their ears, Informing that a stranger, all in tears, Weeping, implored an audience of the gods. Jove, ever prone to succour the distrest, A swell redressive glow'd within his breast, He pitied much the stranger's sad condition, And ordered his immediate admission. The stranger enter'd, bowed respect to all; Respectful silence reign'd throughout the hall. His chequer'd robes excited their surprise, Richly travers'd with various glowing dyes; A target on his strong left arm he bore, Broad as the shield the mighty Fingal wore; The glowing landscape on its centre shin'd, And massy thistles round the borders twin'd; His brows were bound with yellow-blossom'd broom, Green birch and roses blending in perfume; His eyes beam'd honour, though all red with grief, And thus Heaven's King spake comfort to the Chief: “My son, let speech unfold thy cause of woe, Say, why does melancholy cloud thy brow? 'Tis mine the wrongs of virtue to redress; Speak, for 'tis time to succour deep distress.” Then thus he spake: “O King! by thy command, I am the guardian of that far-fam'd land Nam'd Caledonia, great in arts and arms, And every worth that social fondness charms, With every virtue that the heart approves, Warm in their friendships, rapt'rous in their loves, Profusely generous, obstinately just, Inflexible as death their vows of trust; For independence fires their noble minds, Scorning deceit, as gods do scorn the fiends. But what avail the virtues of the north, No patriot-bard to celebrate their worth, No heav'n-taught minstrel, with the voice of song, To hymn their deeds, and make their names live long! And ah! should Luxury, with soft winning wiles, Spread her contagion o'er my subject isles, My hardy sons, no longer Valour's boast, Would sink despis'd, their wonted greatness lost. Forgive my wish, O King! I speak with awe, Thy will is fate, thy word is sovereign law! O! wouldst thou deign thy suppliant to regard, And grant my country one true patriot-bard, My sons would glory in the blessing given, And virtuous deeds spring from the gift of Heaven!’ To which the god: “My son, cease to deplore, Thy name in song shall sound the world all o'er; Thy bard shall rise full fraught with all the fire That Heav'n and free-born nature can inspire. Ye sacred Nine, your golden harps prepare T' instruct the fav'rite of my special care, That, whether the song be rais'd to war or love, His soul-wing'd strains may equal those above. Now, faithful to thy trust, from sorrow free, Go, wait the issue of our high decree.”— Speechless the Genius stood, in glad surprise, Adoring gratitude beam'd in his eyes; The promis'd bard his soul with transport fills, And, light with joy, he sought his native hills. 'Twas in regard of Wallace and his worth Jove honour'd Coila with his birth; And on that morn, When Burns was born, Each Muse with joy Did hail the boy; And Fame, on tiptoe, fain would blown her horn, But Fate forbade the blast, so premature, Till worth should sanction it beyond the critic's power. His merits proven—Fame her blast hath blown, Now Scotia's Bard o'er all the world is known;— But trembling doubts here check my unpolished lays, What can they add to a whole world's praise? Yet, while revolving time this day returns, Let Scotsmen glory in the name of Burns. ODE. BURNS ANNIVERSARY MEETING. Written for, and Performed at the Celebration of, Robert Burns' Birthday, Paisley, 1807. RECITATIVE. While Gallia's chief, with cruel conquests vain, Bids clanging trumpets rend the skies, The widow's, orphan's, and the father's sighs, Breathe, hissing through the guilty strain; Mild Pity hears the harrowing tones, Mix'd with shrieks and dying groans; While warm Humanity, afar, Weeps o'er the ravages of war, And, shudd'ring, hears Ambition's servile train Rejoicing o'er their thousands slain. But when the song to worth is given, The grateful anthem wings its way to heaven, Rings through the mansions of the bright abodes, And melts to ecstasy the list'ning gods; Apollo, on fire, Strikes with rapture the lyre, And the Muses the summons obey; Joy wings the glad sound To the worlds around, Till all nature re-echoes the lay! Then raise the song, ye vocal few, Give the praise to merit due. SONG. Set to music by R. A. Smith. Though dark scowling Winter, in dismal array, Re-marshals his storms on the bleak hoary hill, With joy we assemble to hail the great day That gave birth to the Bard who ennobles our isle. Then loud to his merits the song let us raise, Let each true Caledonian exult in his praise; For the glory of genius, its dearest reward, Is the laurel entwin'd by his country's regard. Let the Muse bring fresh honours his name to adorn, Let the voice of glad melody pride in the theme, For the genius of Scotia, in ages unborn, Will light up her torch at the blaze of his fame. When the dark mist of ages lies turbid between, Still his star of renown through the gloom shall be seen, And his rich blooming laurels, so dear to the Bard, Will be cherished for aye by his country's regard. RECITATIVE. Yes, Burns, thou “dear departed shade!” When rolling centuries have fled, Thy name shall still survive the wreck of time, Shall rouse the genius of thy native clime; Bards, yet unborn, and patriots shall come, And catch fresh ardour at thy hallow'd tomb! There 's not a cairn-built cottage on our hills, Nor rural hamlet on our fertile plains, But echoes to the magic of thy strains, While every heart with highest transport thrills. Our country's melodies shall perish never, For, Burns, thy songs shall live for ever. Then, once again, ye vocal few, Give the song to merit due. SONG. Written to Marsh's national Air, “Britons, who for freedom bled.” Harmonised as a glee by R. A. Smith. Hail, ye glorious sons of song, Who wrote to humanise the soul! To you our highest strains belong, Your names shall crown our friendly bowl: But chiefly, Burns, above the rest, We dedicate this night to thee: Engrav'd in every Scotsman's breast Thy name, thy worth, shall ever be! Fathers of our country's weal, Sternly virtuous, bold and free! Ye taught your sons to fight, yet feel The dictates of humanity. But chiefly, Burns, above the rest, We dedicate this night to thee: Engrav'd in every Scotsman's breast Thy name, thy worth, shall ever be! Haughty Gallia threats our coast, We hear her vaunts with disregard; Secure in valour, still we boast “The Patriot, and the Patriot-bard.” But chiefly, Burns, above the rest, We dedicate this night to thee: Engraved in every Scotsman's breast Thy name, thy worth, shall ever be! Yes, Caledonians! to our country true, Which Danes nor Romans never could subdue, Firmly resolved our native rights to guard, Let 's toast—“The Patriot, and the Patriot-bard.” ODE. BURNS ANNIVERSARY MEETING, 1810. Again the happy day returns,— A day to Scotsmen ever dear,— Though bleakest of the changeful year, It blest us with a Burns. Fierce the whirling blast may blow, Drifting wide the crispy snow; Rude the ruthless storms may sweep, Howling round our mountains steep; While the heavy lashing rains Swell our rivers, drench our plains, And the angry ocean roars Round our broken, craggy shores; But, mindful of our Poet's worth, We hail the honour'd day that gave him birth. Come, ye vot'ries of the lyre, Trim the torch of heav'nly fire, Raise the song in Scotia's praise; Sing anew her bonnie braes, Sing her thousand siller streams, Bickering to the sunny beams; Sing her sons beyond compare, Sing her daughters, peerless, fair; Sing, till winter's storms be o'er, The matchless bards that sung before; And I, the meanest of the Muse's train, Shall join my feeble aid to swell the strain. Dear Scotia, though thy clime be cauld, Thy sons were ever brave and bauld, Thy daughters, modest, kind, and leal, The fairest in creation's fiel'; Alike inur'd to every toil, Thou 'rt foremost in the battle broil; Prepar'd alike in peace and weir To guide the plough or wield the spear. As the mountain torrent raves, Dashing through its rugged caves, So the Scottish legions pour, Dreadful in the avenging hour. But when Peace, with kind accord, Bids them sheath the sated sword, See them, in their native vales, Jocund as the summer gales, Cheering labour all the day With some merry roundelay. Dear Scotia, though thy nights be drear, When surly winter rules the year, Around thy cottage hearths are seen The glow of health, the cheerful mien; The mutual glance, that fondly shares A neighbour's joys, a neighbour's cares: Here oft, while raves the wind and weet, The canty lads and lasses meet. Sae light of heart, sae full of glee, Their gaits sae artless and sae free, The hours of joy come dancing on To share their frolic and their fun. Here many a song and jest goes round, With tales of ghosts and rites profound Perform'd in dreary wizard glen By wrinkled hags and warlock men; Or of the hell-fee'd crew combin'd, Carousing on the midnight wind, On some infernal errand bent, While darkness shrouds their black intent. But chiefly, Burns, thy songs delight To charm the weary winter night, And bid the lingering moments flee Without a care, unless for thee, Wha sang sae sweet and dee't sae soon, And sought the native sphere aboon. Thy “lovely Jean,” thy “Nannie, O,” Thy much-lov'd “Caledonia,” Thy “Wat ye wha's in yonder toun,” Thy “Banks and Braes o' Bonnie Doon,” Thy “Shepherdess on Afton Braes,” Thy “Logan Lassie's” bitter waes, Are a' gane o'er, sae sweetly tun'd, That e'en the storm, pleased with the sound, Fa's lown, and sings with eerie slight, “O let me in this ae, ae night.” Alas! our best, our dearest Bard, How poor, how great was his reward! Unaided, he has fix'd his name, Immortal, in the rolls of fame; Yet who can hear without a tear What sorrows wrung his manly breast, To see his little, helpless, filial band Imploring succour from a father's hand, And there no succour near? Himself the while with sick'ning woes opprest, Fast hast'ning on to where the weary rest: For this let Scotia's bitter tears atone— She reck'd not half his worth till he was gone. SUMMONS TO ATTEND A MEETING OF THE BURNS ANNIVERSARY SOCIETY. To WILLIAM M'LAREN. 1805. King Geordie issues out his summons, To ca' his bairns, the Lairds an' Commons, To creesh the nation's moolie-heels, An' butter Commerce' rusty wheels, An' see what new, what untried tax Will lie the easiest on oor backs. The priest convenes his scandal court, To ken what houghmagandie sport Has been gaun on within the parish Since last they met,—their funds to cherish. But I, the servant o' Apollo, Whose mandates I am proud to follow,— He bids me warn you, as the friend Of Burns's fame, that ye 'll attend Neist Friday e'en, in Luckie Wricht's, To spend the best—the wale o' nichts; Sae, under pain o' half-a-merk, Ye 'll come, as signed by me, the Clerk. DIRGE. Written on reading an account of Robert Burns' Funeral. Let grief for ever cloud the day That saw our Bard borne to the clay; Let joy be banish'd every eye, And Nature, weeping, seem to cry— “He 's gone, he 's gone! he 's frae us torn! The ae best fellow e'er was born!” Let Sol resign his wonted powers, Let chilling north winds blast the flowers, That each may droop its withering head, And seem to mourn our Poet dead. He 's gone, he 's gone! he 's frae us torn! The ae best fellow e'er was born!” Let shepherds, from the mountains steep, Look down on widow'd Nith, and weep; Let rustic swains their labours leave, And sighing, murmur o'er his grave— “He 's gone, he 's gone! he 's frae us torn! The ae best fellow e'er was born!” Let bonnie Doon and winding Ayr Their bushy banks in anguish tear, While many a tributary stream Pours down its griefs to swell the theme— “He 's gone, he 's gone! he 's frae us torn! The ae best fellow e'er was born!” All dismal let the night descend, Let whirling storms the forest rend, Let furious tempests sweep the sky, And dreary, howling caverns cry— “He 's gone, he 's gone! he 's frae us torn! The ae best fellow e'er was born!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPISTLES. EPISTLE TO JAMES KING. ON RECEIVING A MORAL EPISTLE FROM HIM. May, 1802. Please accept the thanks and praise Due to your poetic lays; Wisdom aye should be rever'd, Sense to wit be aye preferr'd. —Just your thoughts, in simple guise, Fit to make frail mortals wise; Every period, every line, With some moral truth doth shine. —Like the rocks, which storms divide, Thund'ring down the mountain's side, So strides Time, with rapid force, Round his unobstructed course; Like a flood upon its way, Sweeping downward to the sea: But what figure so sublime As describe the flight of time? Yesterday is past an' gane, Just as it had never been. —Life 's a dream, and man 's a bubble, 'Compass'd round with care and trouble: Like a ship in tempest tost, Soon o'erwhelm'd, for ever lost; Like the short-liv'd passion-flow'r, Blooming, dying, in an hour; Like the tuneful bird that sings, Flutt'ring high on sportive wings, Till the fowler's subtle art Drives Death's message to its heart, While, perhaps, Death aims his blow Swift to lay the wretch as low. —Now, since life is but a day, Make the most of it we may; Calm and tranquil let us be, (Not in drinking to excess— Drink the spirits will depress) Still resign'd to Fate's decree: Let not poortith sink us low, Let not wealth exalt our brow; Let 's be grateful, virtuous, wise— There 's where all our greatness lies; Doing all the good we can Is all that heaven requires of man. —Wherefore should we grieve and sigh, 'Cause we know that he must die? Death 's a debt requir'd by nature, To be paid by every creature. Rich and poor, and high and low, Fall by Death's impartial blow: God, perhaps, in kindness will Snatch us from some coming ill; Death may kindly waft us o'er To a milder, happier shore. —But, dear Jamie! after a', What I 've said's not worth a straw; What is 't worth to moralise What we never can practise? As for me, with a' my skill, Passion leads me as she will; But resolves, laid down to-day, Ere to-morrow 're done away.— —Then, let 's ever cheery live, Do our best, and never grieve; Still let Friendship's warmest tie A' deficiencies supply, And, while favour'd by the Nine, I your laurels will entwine. EPISTLE TO JAMES SCADLOCK. ON RECEIVING FROM HIM A SMALL MS. VOLUME OF ORIGINAL SCOTTISH POEMS. April, 1803. While colleged bards bestride Pegasus, And try to gallop up Parnassus By dint o' meikle lear, The lowe o' friendship fires my soul To write you this poetic scrawl,— Prosaic, dull, I fear! But weel I ken your gen'rous heart Will overlook its failings, And where the poet has come short Let friendship cure his ailings. 'Tis kind, man, divine, man, To hide the fault we see, Or try to men't, as far 's we ken't, Wi' true sincerity. This last observe bring'st in my head To tell you here my social creed— Let 's use a' mankind weel; And ony sumph who 'd use us ill, Wi' dry contempt let 's treat him still— He 'll feel it worst himsel'. I never flatter, praise but rare; I scorn a double part; And when I speak, I speak sincere, The dictates o' my heart. I truly hate the dirty gait That mony a body tak's, Wha fraise ane, syne blaze ane, As soon 's they turn their backs. In judging, let us be right hooly; I 've heard some folks descant sae freely On other people's matters, As if theirsel's were real perfection, When, had they stood a fair inspection, The abused were far their betters. But gossips aye maun ha'e their crack, Though moralists should rail; Let 's end the matter wi' this fact, That “Goodness pays itsel'.” The joys, man, that rise, man, To ane frae doing weel, Are siccan joys that hardened vice Can seldom ever feel. O Jamie, man! I 'm proud to see 't, Our ain auld muse yet keeps her feet, Maist healthy as before; For sad predicting fears foretauld, When Robin's glowing heart turned cauld, Then a' our joys were o'er (Ilk future bard revere his name, Through thousand years to come, And, though we cannot reach his fame, Busk laurels round his tomb): Yet, though he 's dead, the Scottish reed This mony a day may ring, In Livingston, in Anderson, In Scadlock, and in King. “The Tap-room”—what a glorious treat! “Complaint and Wish”—how plaintive sweet! “The Weaver's” just “Lament.” “The Gloamin' Fragment”—how divine! There nature speaks in every line— The bard's immortal in't! Yon “Epigram on Jeanie Lang” Is pointed as the steel; An' “Hoot! ye ken yoursel's”—a sang Would pleased e'en Burns himsel'! Let snarling, mean quarr'ling Be doubly damned henceforth! And let us raise the voice of praise, To hearten modest worth. And you, my dear respected frien', Your “Spring” 's a precious evergreen, Fresh beauties budding still. Your “Levern Banks,” and “Killoch Burn,” Ye sing them wi' sae sweet a turn, Ye gar the heart-strings thrill. “October Winds”—e'en let them rave Wi' nature-blasting howl, If, in return, kind heaven give The sunshine of the soul: The feeling heart that bears a part In others' joys and woes, May still depend to find a friend, Howe'er the tempest blows. Yet, long I 've thought, and think it yet, True friends are rarely to be met Wha share in others' troubles; Who jointly joy, or drop the tear Reciprocal, and kindly bear Wi' one anothers' foibles. Even such a friend I once could boast, Ah! now in death he 's low; But fond anticipation hopes For such a friend in you. Dear Jamie, forgi'e me That last presumptive line; See, here 's my hand at your command— Ye ha'e my heart langsyne! EPISTLE TO JAMES BARR. WHEREVER HE MAY BE FOUND. March, 1804. Gude Pibrocharian, jorum-jirger, Say, ha'e ye turn'd an Antiburgher? Or lang-fac'd Presbyterian elder? Deep read in wiles o' gath'ring siller? Or cauld, splenetic solitair, Resolv'd to herd wi' man nae mair? As to the second, I 've nae fear for't; For siller, faith! ye ne'er did care for't, Unless to help a needfu' body, And get an antrin glass o' toddy. But what the black mischief's come owre you? These three months I 've been speiring for you, Till e'en the Muse, wi' downright grieving, Has worn her chafts as thin 's a shaving. Say, ha'e ye ta'en a tramp to Lon'on In Co. wi' worthy auld Buchanan, Wha mony a mile wad streek his shanks To ha'e a crack wi' Josie Banks Concerning “Shells, and birds, and metals, Moths, spiders, butterflies, and beetles”? For you, I think you'll cut a figure Wi' king o' pipers, Malc. M'Gregor, And wi' your clarion, flute, and fiddle Will gar their southron heart-strings diddle. Or are you through the kintra whisking, Accoutr'd wi' the sock and buskin, Thinking to climb to wealth and fame By adding Roscius to your name? Frae thoughts o' that, pray keep abeigh! Ye 're far owre auld, and far owre heigh; Since in these novel-hunting days There 's nane but bairns can act our plays. At twal-year auld, if ye had tried it, I doubtna but ye might succeedit; But full-grown buirdly chields like you— Quite monstrous, man, 'twill never do! Or are ye gane, as there are few sic, For teaching of a band o' music? O, hear auld Scotland's fervent pray'rs, And teach her genuine native airs! Whilk simply play'd, devoid o' art, Thrill through the senses to the heart. Play, when you'd rouse the patriot's saul, True valour's tune, “The garb of Gaul” And when laid low in glory's bed, Let “Roslin Castle” soothe his shade. “The Bonnie Bush aboon Traquair,” Its every accent breathes despair; And “Ettrick's Banks,” celestial strain! Mak's summer's gloaming mair serene; And, O how sweet the plaintive muse, Amang “The broom o' Cowdenknowes!” To hear the love-lorn swain complain, Lone, on “The Braes o' Ballendine,” It e'en might melt the dortiest she That ever sklinted scornfu' e'e. When Beauty tries her vocal pow'rs Amang the greenwood's echoing bow'rs, “The bonnie birks of Invermay” Might mend a seraph's sweetest lay. Then, should grim Care invest your castle, Just knock him down wi' “Willie Wastle,” And rant blithe “Lumps o' pudding owre him,” And, for his dirge, sing “Tullochgorum.” When Orpheus charm'd his wife frae hell, 'Twas nae Scotch tune he play'd sae well, Else had the worthy auld wire-scraper Been keepit for his deilship's piper. Or if ye 're turn'd a feather'd fop, Light dancing upon fashion'd top, Wi' lofty brow and selfish e'e, Despising low-clad dogs like me; Uncaring your contempt or favour, Sweet butterfly, adieu for ever! But, hold—I 'm wrong to doubt your sense, For pride proceeds from ignorance. If peace of mind lay in fine clothes, I'd be the first of fluttering beaux, And strut as proud as ony peacock That ever craw'd on tap o' hay-cock; And ere I 'd know one vexing thought, Get dollar-buttons on my coat, Wi' a' the lave o' fulsome trash on, That constitutes a man o' fashion. O, grant me this, kind Providence, A moderate, decent competence; Thou'lt see me smile in independence, Above weak-saul'd, pride-born ascendence; But whether ye 're gane to teach the whistle, 'Midst noise and rough reg'mental bustle; Or gane to strut upon the stage, Smit wi' the mania o' the age; Or, Scotsman like, ha'e tramp'd abreed To yon big town far south the Tweed; Or douring in the hermit's cell, Unblessing and unblest yoursel'— In Gude's name write!—tak' up your pen, An' how ye 're doing let me ken. Sae, hoping quickly your epistle, Adieu! thou genuine son of song and whistle. POSTSCRIPT. We had a concert here short syne; Oh, man! the music was divine, Baith plaintive sang, and merry glee, In a' the soul of harmony. When Smith and Stuart leave this earth, The gods, in token o' their worth, Will welcome them at heaven's portals, The brightest, truest, best o' mortals; Apollo proud, as weel he may, Will walk on tiptoe a' that day; While a' the Muses kindred claim, Rememb'ring what they 've done for them. EPISTLE TO JAMES SCADLOCK. THEN AT PERTH. June, 1804. Let those who never felt its flame Say friendship is an empty name; Such selfish, cold philosophy For ever I disclaim: It soothes the soul with grief opprest, Half cures the care-distemper'd breast, And in the jocund happy hour Gives joy a higher zest. All nature sadden'd at our parting hour, Winds plaintive howl'd, clouds, weeping, dropt a show'r; Our fields look'd dead—as if they 'd said, “We ne'er shall see him more.” Though fate and fortune threw their darts, Envying us your high deserts, They well might tear you from our arms, But never from our hearts. When spring buds forth in vernal show'rs, When summer comes array'd in flow'rs, Or autumn kind, from Ceres' horn, Her grateful bounty pours; Or bearded winter curls his brow— I 'll often fondly think on you, And on our happy days and nights, With pleasing backcast view. If e'er in musing mood you stray Alang the banks of classic Tay, Think on our walks by Stanely Tower, And steep Gleniffer brae; Think on our langsyne happy hours, Spent where the burn wild, rapid, pours, And o'er the horrid dizzy steep Dashes her mountain stores; Think on our walks by sweet Greenlaw, By woody hill and birken shaw, Where nature strews her choicest sweets To make the landscape braw; And think on rural Ferguslie, Its plantings green, and flow'ry lee: Such fairy scenes, though distant far, May please the mental e'e. Yon mentor, Geordie Zimmerman, Agrees exactly with our plan, That partial hours of solitude Exalt the soul of man. So, oft retir'd from strife and din, Let 's shun the jarring ways of men, And seek serenity and peace By stream and woody glen. But ere a few short summers gae Your friend will mix his kindred clay, For fell disease tugs at my breast, To hurry me away. Yet while life's bellows bear to blaw, Till life's last lang-fetch'd breath I draw, I 'll often fondly think on you, And mind your kindness a'. Now, fare-ye-weel! still may ye find A friend congenial to your mind, To share your joys, and half your woes— Warm, sympathising, kind. EPISTLE TO WILLIAM THOMSON. June, 1805. Dear Will, my much respected frien', I send you this to let you ken That, though at distance fate hath set you, Your friends in Paisley don't forget you, But often think on you, far lone, Amang the braes of Overton. Our social club continues yet, Perpetual source of mirth and wit; Our rigid rules admit but few, Yet still we 'll keep a chair for you. A country life I 've oft envied, Where love, and truth, and peace preside: Without temptations to allure, Your days glide on, unstain'd and pure; Nae midnight revels waste your health, Nor greedy landlord drains your wealth; You're never fasht wi' whisky fever, Nor dizzy pow, nor dulness ever, But breathe the halesome caller air, Remote from aught that genders care. I needna tell how much I lang To hear your rural Scottish sang; To hear you sing your heath-clad braes, Your jocund nights, and happy days; And lilt with glee the blithesome morn, When dewdraps pearl every thorn; When larks pour forth the early sang, And linties chant the whins amang, And pyats hap frae tree to tree, Teaching their young anes how to flee; While, frae the mavis to the wren, A' warble sweet in bush or glen. In town we scarce can find occasion To note the beauties o' creation, But study mankind's different dealings, Their virtues, vices, merits, failings,— Unpleasing task, compar'd wi' yours: You range the hills 'mang mountain flow'rs, And view, afar, the smoking town, More blest than all its riches were your own. A lang epistle I might scribble, But aiblins ye will grudge the trouble Of reading sic low, hamert rhyme, And sae it 's best to quat in time; Sae I, with soul sincere and fervent, Am still your trusty friend and servant. EPISTLE TO WILLIAM WYLIE. January, 1806. Dear kindred saul, thanks to the cause First made us ken each ither; Ca 't fate, or chance, I carena whilk, To me it brought a brither. Thy furthy, kindly, takin' gait;— Sure every gude chiel' likes thee, And bad luck wring his thrawart heart Wha snarling e'er would vex thee. Though mole-ey'd Fortune's partial hand O' clink may keep thee bare o't; Of what thou hast, pale Misery Receives, unask'd, a share o't. Thou gi'est, without ae hank'rin' thought, Or cauld, self-stinted wish; E'en winter-finger'd Avarice Approves thee with a blush. If Grief e'er make thee her pack-horse, Her leaden load to carry 't, Shove half the burden on my back, I 'll do my best to bear it. Gude kens we a' ha'e faults enou', 'Tis Friendship's task tae cure 'em, But still she spurns the critic view, An' bids us to look o'er 'em. When Death performs his beadle part, An' summons thee to heaven, By virtue of thy warm, kind heart, Thy faults will be forgiven. And shouldst thou live to see thy friend Borne lifeless on the bier, I ask of thee, for epitaph, One kind, elegiac tear. EPISTLE TO ALEXANDER BORLAND. February, 1806. Retired, disgusted, from the tavern roar, Where strong-lung'd Ignorance does highest soar; Where silly ridicule is passed for wit, And shallow laughter takes her gaping fit; Where selfish sophistry out-brothers sense, And lords it high at modesty's expense— Here lone I sit, in musing melancholy, Resolv'd for aye to shun the court of Folly; For, from whole years' experience in her train, One hour of joy brings twenty hours of pain. Now, since I 'm on the would-be-better key, The muse soft whispers me to write to thee; Not that she means a self-debasing letter, But merely show there 's hopes I may turn better; That what stands bad to my account of ill You may set down to passion, not to will. The fate-scourg'd exile, destin'd still to roam Through desert wilds, far from his early home, If some fair prospect meet his sorrowing eyes, Like that he own'd beneath his native skies, Sad recollection, murdering relief, He bursts in all the agonies of grief; Memory presents the volume of his care, And “harrows up his soul” with “such things were.” 'Tis so in life, when Youth folds up his page, And turns the leaf to dark, blank, joyless Age, Where sad Experience speaks in language plain Her thought of bliss, and highest hopes were vain; O'er present ills I think I see her mourn, And “weep past joys that never will return.” Then come, my friend, while yet in life's gay noon, Ere grief's dark clouds obscure our summer sun, Ere winter's sleety blasts around us howl, And chill our every energy of soul— Let us look back, retrace the ways we 've trod, Mark virtue's paths from guilty pleasure's road, And, 'stead of wandering in a devious maze, Mark some few precepts for our future days. I mind, still well, when but a trifling boy, My young heart fluttered with a savage joy, As with my sire I wander'd through the wood, And found the mavis' clump-lodg'd callow brood. I tore them thence, exulting o'er my prize; My father bade me list the mother's cries: “So thine would wail,” he said, “if reft of thee.” It was a lesson of humanity. Humanity! thou 'rt glory's brightest star, Outshining all the conqueror's trophies far! One individual act of generous pity Is nobler far than ravaging a city. Ev'n let the blood-stain'd ruffians call me coward, An Alexander sinks beside a Howard. Not to recount our every early joy, When all was happiness without alloy, Nor tread again each flow'ry field we trac'd, Light as the silk-wing'd butterflies we chas'd, Ere villain-falsehood taught the glowing mind To look with cold suspicion on mankind— Let 's pass the valley of our younger years, And further uphill mark what now appears. We see the sensualist, fell vice's slave, Fatigu'd, worn-out, sink to an early grave; We see the slave of av'rice grind the poor, His thirst for gold increasing with his store; Pack-horse of fortune, all his days are care, Her burdens bearing to his spendthrift heir. Next view the spendthrift, joyous o'er his purse, Exchanging all his guineas for remorse; On pleasure's flow'r-deck'd barge away he 's borne, Supine, till every flow'r starts up a thorn. Then all his pleasures fly, like air-blown bubbles: He, ruin'd, sinks amidst a sea of troubles. Hail, Temperance! thou 'rt wisdom's first, best lore, The sage in ev'ry age does thee adore; Within thy pale we taste of ev'ry joy, O'erstepping that, our highest pleasures cloy: The heart-enliv'ning, friendly, social bowl To rapt'rous ecstasy exalts the soul; But when to midnight hour we keep it up, Next morning feels the poison of the cup. Though fate forbade the gifts of schoolmen mine, With classic art to write the polish'd line, Yet miners oft must gather earth with gold, And truth may strike, though e'er so roughly told. If thou in aught wouldst rise to eminence, Show not the faintest shadow of pretence, Else busy Scandal, with her thousand tongues, Will quickly find thee in ten thousand wrongs; Each strives to tear his neighbour's honour down, As if detracting something from his own. Of all the ills with which mankind is curst, An envious, discontented mind's the worst; There muddy Spleen exalts her gloomy throne, Marks all conditions better than her own: Hence Defamation spreads her ant-bear tongue, And, grimly pleas'd, feeds on another's wrong. Curse on the wretch who, when his neighbour's blest, Erects his peace-destroying, snaky crest! And he who sits in surly, sullen mood, Repining at a fellow-mortal's good! Man owns so little of true happiness, That curst be he who makes that little less! Vice to reclaim, join not the old cant cry Of “Son of Sathan, guilt, and misery”: One good example more the point will carry Than all th' abuse in Scandal's dictionary. The Zealot thinks he 'll go to heaven direct, Adhering to the tenets of his sect, E'en though his practice lie in this alone, To rail at all persuasions but his own. In judging, still let moderation guide; O'erheated zeal is certain to mislead. First bow to God in heart-warm gratitude, Next do your utmost for the general good. In spite of all the forms which men devise, 'Tis there where real solid wisdom lies; And impious is the man who claims dominion, To damn his neighbour diff'ring in opinion. When suppliant Misery greets thy wand'ring eye, Although in public, pass not heedless by; Distress impels her to implore the crowd For that denied within her lone abode. Give thou the trifling pittance which she craves, Though ostentation call'd by prudent knaves; So conscience will a rich reward impart, And finer feelings play around thy heart. When Wealth with arrogance exalts his brow, And reckons Poverty a wretch most low, Let good intentions dignify thy soul, And conscious rectitude will crown the whole. Hence indigence will independence own, And soar above the haughty despot's frown. Still to thy lot be virtuously resign'd; Above all treasures prize thy peace of mind; Then let not envy rob thy soul of rest, Nor discontent e'er harbour in thy breast. Be not too fond of popular applause, Which often echoes in a villain's cause, Whose specious sophistry gilds his deceit, Till pow'r abus'd, in time shows forth the cheat: Yet be't thy pride to bear an honest fame; More dear than life watch over thy good name; For he, poor man! who has no wish to gain it, Despises all the virtues which attain it. Of friendship, still be secrecy the test, This maxim let be 'graven in my breast: Whate'er a friend enjoins me to conceal, I 'm weak, I 'm base, if I the same reveal; Let honour, acting as a pow'rful spell, Suppress that itching fondness still to tell; Else, unthank'd chronicle, the cunning's tool, The world will stamp me for a gossip fool. Yet let us act an honest open part, Nor curb the warm effusions of the heart, Which, naturally virtuous, discommends Aught mean or base, even in our dearest friends. But why this long disjointed scrawl to thee, Whose every action is a law to me; Whose every deed proclaims thy noble mind, Industrious, independent, just, and kind. Methinks I hear thee say, “Each fool may teach, Since now my whim-led friend 's begun to preach!” But this first essay of my preaching strain, Hear, and accept for friendship's sake. Amen. EPISTLE TO JAMES BUCHANAN, KILBARCHAN. August, 1806. My gude auld friend on Locher banks, Your kindness claims my warmest thanks; Yet thanks is but a draff-cheap phrase, Of little value now-a-days; Indeed, it 's hardly worth the heeding, Unless to show a body's breeding. Yet mony a poor, doil't, servile body Will scrimp his stomach of its crowdy, And pride to run a great man's erran's, And feed on smiles and sour cheese-parin's, And think himsel' nae sma' sheep-shank, Rich laden wi' his Lordship's thank. The sodger, too, for a' his troubles— His hungry wames, and bloody hubbles, His agues, rheumatisms, cramps, Received in plashy winter camps— O blest reward! at last he gains His sov'reign's thanks for a' his pains. 'Twas wisely said by “Queer Sir John,” That “Honour wadna buy a scone.” Sae ane, of thanks, may get a million, Yet live as puir's a porter's scullion; Indeed, they 're just (but, beg your pardon), Priest-blessing like, no' worth a fardin. Thus, though 'mang first of friends I rank you, 'Twere but sma' compliment to thank you; Yet, lest ye think me here ungratefu'— Of hatefu' names a name most hatefu'— The neist time that ye come to toun, By a' the pow'rs beneath the moon! I 'll treat you wi' a Highland gill, Though it should be my hindmost fill. Though in the bustling town, the Muse Has gather'd little feck of news: —'Tis said, the Court of Antiquarians Has split on some great point of variance; For ane has got, in gowden box, The spectacles of auld John Knox; A second proudly thanks his fate wi' The hindmost pen that Nelson wrote wi'; A third ane owns an antique rare— A sape-brush made of mermaid's hair! But, niggard wights! they a' refuse 'em, These precious relics, to the museum, Whilk selfish, mean, illegal deeds Ha'e set them a' at loggerheads. 'Tis also said our noble Prince Has play'd the wee saut loon for ance, Has gi'en his bonnie wife the fling, Yet gars her wear Hans Carvel's ring; But a' sic clish-clash cracks I 'll lea' To yon sculdudry committee. Sure, taste refin'd and public spirit Stand next to genius in merit; I 'm proud to see your warm regard For Caledonia's dearest bard; Of him ye 've got sae gude a painting, Referring to a Portrait of Robert Burns, painted for the Kilbarchan Burns Anniversary Society by J. Tannock. That nocht but real life is awanting. I think yon rising genius, Tannock, May gain a niche in Fame's heigh winnock; There, with auld Rubens, placed sublime, Look down upon the wreck of time. I ne'er, as yet, ha'e found a patron, For, scorn be till 't! I hate a' flatt'rin'; Besides, I never had an itching To slake about a great man's kitchen, And, like a spaniel, lick his dishes, And come and gang just to his wishes; Yet, studious to give worth its due, I pride to praise the like of you, Gude chields, replete wi' sterling sense, Wha wi' their worth mak' nae pretence. Aye—there 's my worthy friend, M'Math, I 'll lo'e him till my latest breath, And like a traitor wretch be hanged Before I 'd hear that fellow wranged. His ev'ry action shows his mind, Humanely noble, bright, and kind; And here 's the worth o't, doubly rooted, He never speaks ae word aboot it! —My compliments an' warm gude-will To Maisters Semple, Barr, and Lyle. Wad rav'ning Time but spare my pages, They 'd tell the world in after ages That it, to me, was wealth and fame To be esteem'd by chields like them. O Time, thou all-devouring bear! Hear—“List, O list”—my ardent pray'r! I crave thee here, on bended knee, To let my dear-lov'd pages be! O take thy sharp-nail'd, nibbling elves To musty scrolls on college shelves! There, with dry treatises on law, Feast, cram, and gorge thy greedy maw; But grant, amid thy thin-sown mercies, To spare, O spare my darling verses! Could I but up through hist'ry wimple With Robertson, or sage Dalrymple, Or had I half the pith and lear Of a Mackenzie, or a Blair, I aiblins then might tell some story Wad show the Muse in bleezing glory; But scrimpt o' time and lear scholastic, My lines limp on in Hudibrastic, Till Hope, grown sick, flings down her claim, And drops her dream of future fame. —Yes, O waesucks! should I be vauntie? My Muse is just a Rosinante: She stammers forth with hilching canter, Sagely intent on strange adventure; Yet, sae uncouth in garb and feature, She seems the Fool of Literature. But lest the critic's birsie besom Soop aff this cant of egotism, I 'll sidelins hint—na, bauldly tell, I whiles think something o' mysel': Else, wha the deil wad fash to scribble, Expecting scorn for a' his trouble? Yet, lest dear self should be mista'en, I 'll fling the bridle o'er the mane; For, after a', I fear this jargon Is but a Willie Glassford bargain. William Glassford, a writer of doggerel verses, which he hawked in pennyworths amongst the inhabitants of Paisley. EPISTLE TO ROBERT ALLAN, KILBARCHAN. 1807. Dear Robin, The Muse is now a wee at leisure, And sits her doun wi' meikle pleasure To skelp you aff a blaud o' rhyme As near 's she can to true sublime; But here 's the rub—poor poet-devils, We 're compass'd round wi' mony evils; We jerk oursel's into a fever To give the world something clever, And after a' perhaps we muddle In vile prosaic stagnant puddle. For me—I seldom choose a subject, My rhymes are oft without an object; I let the Muse e'en tak' her win', And dash awa' through thick and thin: For Method's sic a servile creature, She spurns the wilds o' simple nature, And paces on, wi' easy art, A lang day's journey frae the heart. Sae what comes uppermaist you'll get it; Be 't good or ill, for you I write it. How fares my worthy friend, the bard? Robert Allan, Kilbarchan, was a minor poet of some eminence. Be peace and honour his reward! May every ill that gars us fyke, Bad webs, toom pouches, and sic like, And ought that would his spirit bend, Be ten miles distant frae my friend. Alas! this wicked, endless war, Rul'd by some vile, malignant star, Has sunk poor Britain low indeed, Has robb'd Industry o' her bread, And dash'd the sair-won cog o' crowdie Frae mony an honest, eident body; While Genius, dying through neglect, Sinks down amidst the general wreck. Just like twa cats tied tail to tail, They worry at it, tooth and nail; They girn, they bite in deadly wrath, And what is 't for? For nought, in faith! Wee Lourie Frank, A personification of France. wi' brazen snout, Nae doubt would like to scart us out, For proud John Bull, aye us'd to hone him, Will no' gi'e o'er to spit upon him. But Lourie's raised to sic degree, John would be wise to let him be; Else aiblins, as he 's wearin' aul', Frank yet may tear him spawl frae spawl, For wi' the mony chirts he 's gotten, I fear his constitution's rotten. But while the bullying blades o' Europe Are boxing ither to a syrup, Let 's mind oursel's as weel's we can, And live in peace, like man and man, And no cast out, and fecht like brutes, Without a cause for our disputes. When I read o'er your kind epistle, I didna dance, nor sing, nor whistle, But jump'd and cried, “Huzza! huzza!” Like Robin Roughhead in the play. But to be serious—jest aside— I felt a glow o' secret pride Thus to be roos'd by ane like you; Yet doubted if sic praise was due, Till self thus reason'd in the matter: Ye ken that Robin scorns to flatter, And ere he 'd prostitute his quill, He 'd rather burn his rhyming mill— Enough! I cried—I 've gain'd my end, Since I ha'e pleas'd my worthy friend. My sangs are now before the warl', And some may praise, and some may snarl. They ha'e their faults, yet I can tell Nane sees them clearer than mysel'; But still, I think, they too inherit Amang the dross some sparks o' merit. Then come, my dear Parnassian brither, Let 's lay our poet-heads thegither, And sing our ain sweet native scenes, Our streams, our banks, and rural plains, Our woods, our shaws, and flow'ry holms, And mountains clad wi' purple blooms, Wi' burnies bickerin' doon their braes, Reflecting back the sunny rays: Ye 've Semple Woods, and Calder Glen, And Locher Bank, sweet fairy den! And Auchenames, a glorious theme! Where Crawford liv'd, of deathless name, Where Sempill sued his lass to win, And Nelly rose and let him in; Where Habbie Simpson lang did play, The first o' pipers in his day; And though aneath the turf langsyne, Their sangs and tunes shall never tyne. Sae, Robin, briskly ply the Muse; She warms our hearts, expands our views, Gars every sordid passion flee, And waukens every sympathy. Now, wishing Fate may never tax you Wi' cross, nor loss, to thraw and vex you, But keep you hale till ninety-nine, Till you and yours in honour shine, Shall ever be my earnest pray'r, While I 've a friendly wish to spare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TANNAHILL'S POEMS. TOWSER. A TRUE TALE. 20th July, 1806. “Dogs are honest creatures, Ne'er fawn on any that they love not; And I 'm a friend to dogs— They ne'er betray their masters.” In mony an instance, without doubt, The man may copy from the brute, And by th' example grow much wiser;— Then read the short memoirs of Towser. With def'rence to our great Lavaters, Wha judge a' mankind by their features, There 's a mony a smiling, pleasant-fac'd cock That wears a heart no' worth a castock; While mony a visage, antic, droll, O'erveils a noble, gen'rous soul. With Towser this was just the case: He had an ill-faur'd tawted face, His make was something like a messin, But big, and quite unprepossessin'. His master coft him frae some fallows, Wha had him doom'd unto the gallows, Because (sae hap'd poor Towser's lot) He wadna tear a comrade's throat; Yet in affairs of love or honour He 'd stand his part amang a hunner, And where'er fighting was a merit He never fail'd to show his spirit. He never girn'd in neighbour's face With wild, ill-natur'd scant of grace; Nor e'er accosted ane with smiles, Then, soon as turn'd, would bite his heels; Nor ever kent the courtier art, To fawn with rancour at his heart; Nor aught kent he of cankert quarrelling, Nor snarling just for sake of snarling: Ye 'd pinch him sair afore he 'd growl, Which shows he had a mighty soul. But what adds maistly to his fame, And will immortalise his name— (Immortalise!—presumptuous wight! Thy lines are dull as darkest night, Without ae spark o' wit or glee To licht them through futurity. E'en be it sae)—poor Towser's story, Though lamely tauld, will speak his glory. 'Twas in the month o' cauld December, When nature's fire seem'd just an ember, And growling winter bellow'd forth In storms and tempests frae the north, When honest Towser's loving master, Regardless o' the surly bluster, Set out to the neist borough town To buy some needments of his own, And, case some purse-pest should waylay him, He took his trusty servant wi' him. His business done, 'twas near the gloaming, And aye the king o' storms was foaming; The doors did ring—lum-pigs down tumbl'd— The strands gush'd big—the sinks loud rumbl'd; Auld grannies spread their looves, and sigh'd, Wi' “Oh, sirs! what an awfu' night!” Poor Towser shook his sides a' draigl'd, And 's master grudg'd that he had taigl'd; But, wi' his merchandizing load, Come weel, come wae, he took the road. Now clouds drave o'er the fields like drift, Night flung her black cloak o'er the lift, And through the naked trees and hedges The horrid storm, redoubled, rages; And, to complete his piteous case, It blew directly in his face. Whiles 'gainst the footpath stabs he thumped, Whiles o'er the coots in holes he plumped; But on he gaed, and on he waded, Till he at length turn'd faint and jaded. To gang he could nae langer bide, But lay down by the bare dyke-side.— Now, wife and bairns rush'd on his soul; He groan'd—poor Towser loud did howl, And, mourning, cower'd down beside him; But, oh! his master couldna heed him, For now his senses 'gan to dozen, His vera life-streams maist were frozen, An 't seemed as if the cruel skies Exulted o'er their sacrifice; For fierce the winds did o'er him hiss, And dashed the sleet on his cauld face. As on a rock, far, far frae land, Twa shipwreck'd sailors shiv'ring stand, If chance a vessel they descry, Their hearts exult with instant joy; Sae was poor Towser joy'd to hear The tread of trav'llers drawing near. He ran, and yowl'd, and fawn'd upon 'em, But couldna make them understand him, Till, tugging at the foremost's coat, He led them to the mournfu' spot, Where, cauld and stiff, his master lay, To the rude storm a helpless prey. With Caledonian sympathy They bore him kindly on the way, Until they reach'd a cottage bien. They tauld the case, were welcom'd in. The rousing fire, the cordial drop, Restor'd him soon to life and hope; Fond raptures beam'd in Towser's eye, And antic gambols spake his joy. Wha reads this simple tale may see The worth of sensibility, And learn frae it to be humane— In Towser's life he sav'd his ain. BAUDRONS AND THE HEN BIRD. A FABLE. Some folks there are of such behaviour, They 'll cringe themselves into your favour, And when you think their friendship staunch is, They 'll tear your character to inches: T' enforce this truth as well 's I 'm able, Please, reader, to peruse a fable. Deborah, an auld wealthy maiden, With spleen, remorse, and scandal laden, Sought out a solitary spat, To live in quiet with her cat, A meikle, sonsy, tabby she ane, (For Deborah abhorr'd a he ane); And in the house, to be a third, She gat a wee hen chuckie bird. Soon as our slee nocturnal ranger Beheld the wee bit timid stranger, She thus began, with friendly fraise: “Come ben, puir thing, and warm your taes; This weather's cauld, and wet, and dreary, I 'm wae to see you look sae eerie. Sirs! how your tail and wings are dreeping! Ye 've surely been in piteous keeping; See, here 's my dish, come tak' a pick o 't, But, 'deed, I fear there 's scarce a lick o 't.” Sic sympathising words of sense Soon gain'd poor chuckie's confidence; And while Deborah mools some crumbs, Auld baudrons sits and croodling thrums: In short, the twa soon grew sae pack, Chuck roosted upon pussy's back! But ere sax wee short days were gane, When baith left in the house alane, Then thinks the hypocritic sinner, Now, now 's my time to ha'e a dinner: Sae, with a squat, a spring, and squall, She tore poor chuckie spawl frae spawl. Then mind this maxim: Rash acquaintance Aft leads to ruin and repentance. THE AMBITIOUS MITE. A FABLE. When Hope persuades, and Fame inspires us, And Pride with warm ambition fires us, Let Reason instant seize the bridle, And wrest us frae the passions' guidal; Else, like the hero of our fable, We 'll aft be plung'd into a habble. 'Twas on a bonnie simmer day, When a' the insect tribes were gay, Some journeying o'er the leaves of roses, Some brushing thrang their wings and noses, Some wallowing sweet in bramble blossom, In Luxury's saft downy bosom; While ithers of a lower order Were perch'd on plantain leaf's smooth border, Wha frae their twa-inch steeps look'd down, And view'd the kintra far around. Ae pridefu' elf, amang the rest, Wha's pin-point heart bumpt 'gainst his breast, To work some mighty deed of fame That would immortalise his name, Through future hours would hand him down, The wonder of an afternoon; (For ae short day with them appears As lang 's our lengthen'd hunner years). By chance, at hand, a bow'd horse hair Stood up six inches high in air; He plann'd to climb this lofty arch, With philosophic deep research, To prove (which aft perplex their heads) What people peopled ither blades, Or, from keen observation, show Whether they peopled were or no. Our tiny hero onward hies, Quite big with daring enterprise; Ascends the hair's curvatur'd side, Now pale with fear, now red with pride, Now hanging pend'lous by the claw, Now glad at having 'scaped a fa'. What horrid dangers he came through Would trifling seem for man to know; Suffice, at length he reached the top, The summit of his pride and hope, And on his elevated station Had plac'd himself for observation, When, puff—the wind did end the matter, And dash'd him in a horse-hoof gutter. Sae let the lesson gi'en us here Keep each within his proper sphere, And when our fancies tak' their flight, Think on the wee ambitious mite. THE STORM. WRITTEN IN OCTOBER. Now the dark rains of autumn discolour the brook, And the rough winds of winter the woodlands deform, Here, lonely, I lean by the sheltering rock, A-list'ning the voice of the loud-howling storm. Now dreadfully furious it roars on the hill, The deep-groaning oaks seem all writhing with pain; Now awfully calm, for a moment 'tis still, Then bursting it howls and it thunders again. How cheerless and desert the fields now appear, Which so lately in summer's rich verdure were seen, And each sad drooping spray from its heart drops a tear, As seeming to weep its lost mantle of green. See, beneath the rude wall of yon ruinous pile, From the merciless tempest the cattle have fled, And yon poor patient steed, at the gate by the stile, Looks wistfully home for his sheltering shed. Ah! who would not feel for yon poor gipsy race, Peeping out from the door of the old roofless barn; There my wandering fancy her fortunes might trace, And sour Discontent there a lesson might learn. Yet oft in my bosom arises the sigh, That prompts the warm wish distant scenes to explore; Hope gilds the fair prospect with visions of joy, That happiness reigns on some far distant shore. But yon grey hermit-tree which stood lone on the moor, By the fierce driving blast to the earth is blown down: So the lone houseless wand'rer, unheeded and poor, May fall unprotected, unpitied, unknown. See! o'er the grey steep, down the deep craggy glen, Pours the brown foaming torrent, swell'd big with the rain: It roars through the caves of its dark wizard den, Then, headlong, impetuous it sweeps through the plain. Now the dark heavy clouds have unbosom'd their stores, And far to the westward the welkin is blue, The sullen winds hiss as they die on the moors, And the sun faintly shines on yon bleak mountain's brow. THE RESOLVE. “Him who ne'er listen'd to the voice of praise, The silence of neglect can ne'er appal.” —Beattie. 'Twas on a sunny Sabbath-day, When wark-worn bodies get their play (Thanks to the rulers o' the nation, Wha gi'e us all a toleration, To gang as best may please oursel's— Some to the kirk, some to the fiel's), I wander'd out, with serious look, To read twa page on Nature's book; For lang I 've thought, as little harm in Hearing a lively out-field sermon, Even though rowted by a stirk, As that aft bawl'd in crowded kirk By some proud, stern, polemic wight, Wha cries, “My way alone is right!” Wha lairs himself in controversy, Then damns his neighbours without mercy, As if the fewer that were spar'd, These few would be the better ser'd. Now to my tale—digression o'er— I wander'd out by Stanely tow'r; The lang grass on its tap did wave, Like weeds upon a warrior's grave, Whilk seem'd to mock the bloody braggers, And grow on theirs as rank 's on beggars'— But hold—I 'm frae the point again: I wander'd up Gleniffer glen; There, leaning 'gainst a mossy rock, I, musing, eyed the passing brook, That in its murmurs seem'd to say, “'Tis thus thy life glides fast away: Observe the bubbles on my stream; Like them, fame is an empty dream; They blink a moment to the sun, Then burst, and are for ever gone. So fame 's a bubble of the mind; Possess'd, 'tis nought but empty wind— No courtly gem e'er purchas'd dearer, And ne'er can satisfy the wearer. Let them wha ha'e a bleezing share o 't Confess the truth, they sigh for mair o 't. Then let contentment be thy cheer, And never soar aboon thy sphere: Rude storms assail the mountain's brow That lightly skiff the vale below.” A gaudy rose was growing near, Proud, tow'ring on its leafy brier; In fancy's ear it seemed to say— “Sir, have you seen a flow'r so gay? The poets in my praise combine, Comparing Chloe's charms to mine; The sunbeams for my favour sue me, And dark-brow'd Night comes down to woo me; But when I shrink from his request, He draps his tears upon my breast, And in his misty cloud sits wae, Till chased away by rival day. That streamlet's grov'lling grunting fires me, Since no ane sees me, but admires me. See yon bit violet 'neath my view. Wee sallow thing, its nose is blue! And that bit primrose 'side the breckan, Puir yellow ghaist, it seems forsaken! The sun ne'er throws ae transient glow, Unless when passing whether or no; But wisely spurning ane so mean, He blinks on me from morn till e'en.” To which the primrose calm replied: “Poor gaudy gowk, suppress your pride, For soon the strong flow'r-sweeping blast Shall strew your honours in the dust; While I, beneath my lowly bield, Will live and bloom frae harm conceal'd; And while the heavy raindrops pelt you, You'll maybe think on what I 've tell't you.” The rose, derisive, seem'd to sneer, And wav'd upon its bonnie brier. Now dark'ning clouds began to gather, Presaging sudden change of weather. I wander'd hame by Stanely green, Deep pond'ring what I 'd heard and seen, Firmly resolv'd to shun from hence The dangerous steeps of eminence; To drop this rhyming trade for ever, And creep through life a plain, day-plodding weaver. THE PARNASSIAD. A VISIONARY VIEW. Come, Fancy, thou hast ever been, In life's low vale, my ready frien', To cheer the clouded hour; Though unfledg'd with scholastic law, Some visionary picture draw With all thy magic pow'r. Now to the intellectual eye The glowing prospects rise, Parnassus' lofty summits high, Far tow'ring 'mid the skies, Where vernally, eternally, Rich leafy laurels grow, With bloomy bays, through endless days, To crown the Poet's brow. Sure, bold is he who dares to climb Yon awful jutting rock sublime, Who dares Pegasus sit; For should brain-ballast prove too light, He 'll spurn him from his airy height, Down to oblivion's pit, There, to disgrace for ever doom'd, To mourn his sick'ning woes, And weep that ever he presum'd Above the vale of prose. Then, O beware! with prudent care, Nor 'tempt the steeps of fame, And leave behind thy peace of mind, To gain a sounding name. Behold!—yon ready rhyming carl, With flatt'ry fir'd, attracts the warl', By canker'd, pers'nal satire; He takes th' unthinking crowd's acclaim For sterling proofs of lasting fame, And deals his inky spatter. Now, see! he on Pegasus flies With bluff, important straddle! He bears him midway up the skies— See! see! he 's off the saddle! He headlong tumbles, growls and grumbles, Down the dark abyss; The noisy core, that prais'd before, Now join the general hiss. Now see another vent'rer rise, Deep fraught with fulsome eulogies, To win his patron's favour,— One of those adulating things That, dangling in the train of kings, Give guilt a splendid cover. He mounts, well prefac'd by “my Lord,” Inflicts the spur's sharp wound; Pegasus spurns the great man's word, And won't move from the ground. Now, mark his face, flush'd with disgrace, Through future life to grieve on; His wishes cross'd, his hopes all lost, He sinks into oblivion. Yon city scribbler thinks to scale The cliffs of fame with Pastoral, In worth thinks none e'er richer, Yet never climbed the upland steep, Nor e'er beheld a flock of sheep, Save those driven by the butcher; Nor ever mark'd the gurgling stream, Except the common sewer. On rainy days, when dirt and slime Pour'd turbid past his door. Choice epithets in store he gets From Virgil, Shenstone, Pope, With tailor art tacks part to part, And makes his Past'ral up. But see, rich clad in native worth, Yon Bard of Nature ventures forth In simple modest tale; Applauding millions catch the song, The raptur'd rocks the notes prolong, And hand them to the gale. Pegasus kneels—he takes his seat— Now, see! aloft he tow'rs, To place him 'bove the reach of fate, In Fame's ambrosial bow'rs: To be enroll'd with bards of old In ever-honour'd station, The gods, well-pleas'd, see mortals rais'd Worthy of their creation. Now, mark what crowds of hackney scribblers, Imitators, rhyming dabblers, Still follow in the rear! Pegasus spurns us one by one, Yet still, fame-struck, we follow on, And tempt our fate severe: In many a dogg'rel epitaph, And short-lin'd, mournful ditty, Our “Ahs!—Alases!” raise the laugh, Revert the tide of pity. Yet still we write in nature's spite, Our last piece aye the best; Arraigning still, complaining still, The world for want of taste! Observe yon poor deluded man, With threadbare coat and visage wan, Ambitious of a name; The nat'ral claims of meat and cleeding, He reckons these not worth the heeding, But presses on for fame! The public voice, touchstone of worth, Anonymous he tries, But draws the critic's vengeance forth— His fancied glory dies. Neglected now, dejected now, He gives his spleen full scope; In solitude he chews his cud— A downright misanthrope. Then, brother rhymsters, O beware! Nor tempt unscar'd the specious snare, Which self-love often weaves; Nor dote, with a fond father's pains, Upon the offspring of your brains, For fancy oft deceives. To lighten life, a wee bit sang Is sure a sweet illusion! But ne'er provoke the critic's stang By premature intrusion. Lock up your piece, let fondness cease, Till mem'ry fail to bear it, With critic lore then read it o'er, Yourself may judge its merit. CONNEL AND FLORA. A SCOTTISH LEGEND. “The western sun shines o'er the loch, And gilds the mountain's brow, But what are Nature's smiles to me, Without the smile of you? “O, will ye go to Garnock side, Where birks and woodbines twine? I 've sought you oft to be my bride, When, when will ye be mine?” “Oft as ye sought me for your bride, My mind spoke frae my e'e; Then wherefore seek to win a heart That is not mine to gi'e? “With Connel, down the dusky dale, Long plighted are my vows; He won my heart before I wist I had a heart to lose.” The fire flash'd from his eyes of wrath, Dark gloom'd his heavy brow, He grasped her in his arms of strength, And strain'd to lay her low. She wept and cried—the rocks replied; The echoes from their cell, On fairy wing, swift bore her voice To Connel of the dell. With vengeful haste he hied him up; But when stern Donald saw The youth approach, deep stung with guilt, He, shame-fac'd, fled awa'. “Ah! stay, my Connel—sheath thy sword; O, do not him pursue! For mighty are his arms of strength, And thou the fight may rue.” “No! wait thou here—I 'll soon return— I mark'd him from the wood; The lion heart of jealous love Burns for its rival's blood. “Ho! stop thee, coward—villain vile! With all thy boasted art, My sword's blade soon shall dim its shine Within thy reynard heart!” “Ha! foolish stripling, dost thou urge The deadly fight with me? This arm strove hard in Flodden Field, Dost think 'twill shrink from thee?” “Thy frequent vaunts of Flodden Field Were ever fraught with guile: For honour ever marks the brave, But thou 'rt a villain vile!” Their broad blades glitter to the sun, The woods resound each clash; Young Connel sinks 'neath Donald's sword, With deep and deadly gash. “Ah! dearest Flora, soon our morn Of love is overcast! The hills look dim—Alas! my love!” He groaned, and breathed his last. “Stay, ruthless ruffian!—murderer! Here glut thy savage wrath! Be thou the baneful minister To join us low in death!” In wild despair she tore her hair, Sunk speechless by his side— Mild evening wept in dewy tears, And, wrapt in night, she died. THE COCK-PIT. Tannahill, in a note, expresses his desire to satirise the cock-pit and its frequenters. Cock-fighting was a popular and a barbarous amusement in the poet's time. “The great, the important hour is come.” Oh, Hope! thou wily nurse! I see bad luck behind thy back, Dark, brooding, deep remorse. No fancied muse will I invoke To grace my humble strain, But sing my song in homely phrase, Inspir'd by what I 've seen. Here comes a “feeder” with his charge; 'Mong friends 'tis whisper'd straight, How long he swung him on a string, To bring him to his weight. The carpet's laid—pit money drawn— All's high with expectation; With birds bereft of Nature's garb, The “handlers” take their station. What roaring, betting, bawling, swearing, Loudly assail the ear! “Three pounds!”—“four pounds, on Phillip's cock!” “Done! done! come on, sir! here!” Now cast a serious eye around— Behold the motley group, All gamblers, swindlers, ragamuffins, Votaries of the stoup. (But why of it thus lightly speak? The poor man's one best frien'— When fortune's sky lours dark and grim, It clears the drumly scene.) Here sits a wretch with meagre face, And sullen, drowsy eye; Nor speaks he much—last night, at cards, A gamester drained him dry. Here bawls another vent'rous soul, Who risks his every farthing; What deil 's the matter!—though at home His wife and brats are starving. See, here 's a father 'gainst a son, A brother 'gainst a brother, Who e'en with more than common spite Bark hard at one another. But see yon fellow all in black, His looks speak inward joy; Mad happy since his father's death, Sporting his legacy. And mark that aged debauchee, With red bepimpl'd face— He fain would bet a crown or two, But purse is not in case. But hark!—what cry!—“He 's run! he 's run!”— And loud huzzas take place— Now mark what deep dejection sits On every loser's face. Observe the owner—frantic man, With imprecations dread, He grasps his vanquish'd idol-god, And quick twirls off his head. But, bliss attend their feeling souls Who no such deeds delight in! Brutes are but brutes—let men be men, Nor pleasure in cock-fighting. PROLOGUE TO THE GENTLE SHEPHERD. SPOKEN IN A PROVINCIAL THEATRE. Ye patronisers of our little party, My heart 's e'en light to see you a' sae hearty; I 'm fain indeed, and troth! I 've meikle cause, Since your blithe faces half insure applause. We come this night wi' nae new-fangl'd story Of knave's deceit, or fop's vain blust'ring glory, Nor harlequin's wild pranks, with skin like leopard; We 're come to gi'e your ain auld Gentle Shepherd, Whilk aye will charm, and will be read and acket, Till Time himsel' turn auld, and kick the bucket. I mind, langsyne, when I was just a callan, The speaker of the Prologue, Archibald Pollock, comedian (then managing a theatre in Paisley), at whose suggestion Tannahill wrote “The Soldier's Return.” That a' the kintra rang in praise o' Allan; Ilk rising generation toots his fame, And, hunner years to come, 'twill be the same: For wha has read, though e'er sae lang sinsyne, But keeps the living picture on his min'; Approves bauld Patie's clever, manly turn, And maist think Roger cheap o' Jenny's scorn; His dowless gait, the cause of a' his care, For “Nane, except the brave, deserve the fair.” Hence sweet young Peggy lo'ed her manly Pate, And Jenny geck'd at Roger, dowf and blate. Our gude Sir William stands a lesson leal To lairds wha 'd ha'e their vassals lo'e them weel; To prince and peer this maxim it imparts, Their greatest treasures are the people's hearts. Frae Glaud and Simon would we draw a moral— “The virtuous youth-time mak's the canty carl”; The twa auld birkies caper blithe and bauld, Nor shaw the least regret that they 're turned auld. Poor Bauldy! O, it 's like to split my jaws! I think I see him under Madge's claws: Sae may Misfortune tear him spawl and plack, Wha 'd wrang a bonnie lass, and syne draw back. But, Sirs, to you I maist forgat my mission: I 'm sent to beg a truce to criticism. We don't pretend to speak by square and rule, Like yon wise chaps bred up in Thespian school; And to your wishes should we not succeed, Pray be sae kind as tak' the will for deed. (And as our immortal Robin Burns says), “And aiblins though they winna stand the test, Wink hard and say, the folks ha'e done their best”; And keep this gen'rous maxim still in min', “To err is human, to forgive divine!” WILL MACNEIL'S ELEGY. A contemporary of Tannahill's, born in Kilbarchan; apprenticed to the weaving trade, which he abandoned for school teaching. Latterly he entered Glasgow University, and qualified as a surgeon; but there is no record of his having completed his course. He, however, opened a druggist shop in Old Kilpatrick, and was popularly called “Doctor MacNeil.” “He was a man without a clag; His heart was frank without a flaw.” Responsive to the roaring floods, Ye winds, howl plaintive through the woods; Thou gloomy sky, pour down hail clouds, His death to wail; For bright as heaven's brightest studs, Shin'd Will MacNeil. He every selfish thought did scorn, His warm heart in his looks did burn, Ilk body own'd his kindly turn, And gait sae leal; A kinder saul was never born Than Will MacNeil. He ne'er kept up a hidlin plack To spend ahint a comrade's back, But on the table gar'd it whack Wi' free gude will: Free as the wind on winter stack Was Will MacNeil. He ne'er could bide a narrow saul, To a' the social virtues caul'; He wish'd ilk sic a fiery scaul', His shins to peel; Nane sic durst herd in field or faul' Wi' Will MacNeil. He aye abhorr'd the spaniel art; Aye when he spak' 'twas frae the heart; An honest, open, manly part He aye uphel'; “Guile should be develt in the dirt,” Said Will MacNeil. He ne'er had greed to gather gear, Yet rigid kept his credit clear; He ever was to Misery dear, Her loss she 'll feel: She aye got saxpence, or a tear, Frae Will MacNeil. In Scots antiquities he pridit; Auld Hardyknute, he kent wha made it; The bagpipe, too, he sometimes 'say'd it, Pibroch and reel: Our ain auld language, few could read it Like Will MacNeil. In wilyart glens he lik'd to stray, By foggie rocks, or castle gray; Yet ghaist-rid rustics ne'er did say, “Uncanny chiel!” They fill'd their horns wi' usquebae To Will MacNeil. He sail'd and trampit mony a mile, To visit auld I-columb-kill; He clamb the heights o' Jura's isle, Wi' weary speil; But siccan sights aye pay'd the toil Wi' Will MacNeil. He rang'd through Morven's hills and glens, Saw some o' Ossian's moss-grown stanes, Where rest his low-laid heroes' banes, Deep in the hill; He croon'd a c'ronach to their manes,— Kind Will MacNeil! He was deep-read in nature's book, Explor'd ilk dark mysterious crook, Kent a' her laws wi' antrin look, And that right weel; But (fate o' genius) death soon took Aff Will MacNeil. Of ilka rock he kent the ore, He kent the virtues o' ilk flow'r, Ilk banefu' plant he kent its power, And warn'd frae ill: A' nature's warks few could explore Like Will MacNeil. He kent a' creatures, clute and tail, Down frae the lion to the snail, Up frae the mennon to the whale, And kraken eel; Norwegian name for the fabulous “Sea Serpent.” Scarce ane could tell their gaits sae weel As Will MacNeil. Nor past he ought thing slightly by, But with keen scrutinizing eye He to its inmaist bore would pry, Wi' wondrous skill; And teaching ithers aye ga'e joy To Will MacNeil. He kent auld Archimedes' gait, What way he burnt the Roman fleet: “'Twas by the rays' reflected heat Frae speculum steel; For bare refraction ne'er could do't,” Said Will MacNeil. Yet fame his praise did never rair it, For poortith's weeds obscur'd his merit, Forby, he had a bashfu' spirit, That sham'd to tell His worth or wants; let envy spare it To Will MacNeil. O Barra, The chief of the Clan MacNeil. thou wast sair to blame! I here record it to thy shame, Thou let the brightest o' thy name Unheeded steal Through murky life to his lang hame,— Poor Will MacNeil. He ne'er did wrang to living creature, For ill, Will hadna 't in his nature; A warm, kind heart his leading feature, His mainspring wheel; Ilk virtue grew to noble stature In Will MacNeil. There 's no' a man that ever kent him But wi' his tears will lang lament him; He hasna left his match ahint him, At hame or 'fiel'; His worth lang on our minds will print him— Kind Will MacNeil. But close, my sang; my hamert lays Are far unfit to speak his praise; Our happy nights, our happy days, Fareweel, fareweel! Now dowie, mute—tears speak our waes For Will MacNeil! THE CONTRARY. Get up, my Muse, and sound thy chanter, Nae langer wi' our feelings saunter; Ilk true-blue Scot, get up and canter, He 's hale and weel! And lang may Fate keep aff mischanter Frae Will MacNeil. SONNET TO SINCERITY. Pure emanation of the honest soul, Dear to my heart, manly Sincerity! Dissimulation shrinks—a coward foul— Before thy noble art-detesting eye. Thou scorn'st the wretch who acts a double part, Obsequious, servile, flatt'ring to betray, With smiling face that veils a ranc'rous heart, Like sunny morning of tempestuous day. Thou spurn'st the sophist, with his guilty lore, Whom int'rest prompts to weave the specious snare; In independence rich, thou own'st a store Of conscious worth, which changelings never share. Then come, bright virtue, with thy dauntless brow, And crush deceit, vile monster, reptile low. THE CONTRAST. INSCRIBED TO JAMES SCADLOCK. August, 1803. When Love proves false, and friends betray us, All nature seems a dismal chaos Of wretchedness and woe; We stamp mankind a base ingrate; Half loathing life, we challenge fate To strike the final blow. Then settled grief, with wild despair, Stares from our bloodshot eyes, Though oft we try to hide our care, And check our bursting sighs. Still vexed, sae wretched, We seek some lonely wood; There sighing, and crying, We pour the briny flood. Mark the contrast—what joys we find, With friends sincere and beauty kind, Congenial to our wishes; Then life appears a summer's day; Adown Time's crystal stream we play, As sportive's little fishes. We see nought then but general good, Which warm pervades all nature; Our hearts expand with gratitude Unto the great Creator. Then let 's revere the virtuous fair, The friend whose truth is tried; For, without these, go where we please, We 'll always find a void. THE OLD BEGGAR. Do you see the old beggar who sits at the gate, With his beard silvered over like snow? Though he smiles, as he meets the keen arrows of fate, Still his bosom is wearied with woe. Many years has he sat at the foot of the hill; Many days seen the summer sun rise; And, at evening, the passenger passes him still, While the shadows steal over the skies. In the bleak blasts of winter, he hobbles along O'er the heath at the dawning of day; And the dewdrops that freeze the rude thistles among Are the stars that illumine his way. The time was when this beggar, in martial trim dight, Was as bold as the chief of his throng, When he marched through the storms of the day or the night, And still smiled as he journeyed along. Then, his form was athletic,—his eye's vivid glance Spoke the lustre of youth's glowing day; And the village all marked, in the combat and dance, The brave youngster—still valiant as gay. When the prize was proposed, how his footsteps would bound While the maid of his heart led the throng; While the ribbons that circled the Maypole around Waved the trophies of garlands among. See him now; white with age, and with sorrow oppressed, He the gate opens slowly, and sighs. See him drop the big tears on the woe-withered breast— The big tears that fall fast from his eyes. See, his habit all tattered, his shrivelled cheek pale! See, his locks waving thin in the air! See, his lip is half froze with the sharp-cutting gale, And his head, o'er the temples, all bare! Now, the eyebeam no longer in lustre displays The warm sunshine that visits his breast; For deep sunk in its orbit, and darkened its rays, And he sighs for the grave's silent rest! And his voice is grown feeble, his accent is slow, And he sees not the distant hill-side; And he hears not the breezes of morn as they blow, Nor the streams that soft-murmuring glide. To him, all is silent and mournful and dim, Even the seasons pass dreary and slow,— For affliction has placed its cold fetters on him, And his soul is enamoured of woe. See the tear which—imploring—is fearful to roll, Though in silence he bows, as you stray: 'Tis the eloquent silence that speaks to the soul; 'Tis the star of his slow-setting day! Perchance, ere the May blossoms cheerfully wave,— Ere the zephyrs of summer soft sigh,— The sunbeams shall dance o'er the grass on his grave, And his journey be marked—to the sky. ON ALEXANDER WILSON'S Alexander Wilson, born in Seedhill, Paisley, author of “Watty and Meg,” and other poems, emigrated to America in 1794, where he devoted his attention to the Ornithology of his adopted land, and attained fame in that direction. He died at Philadelphia in 1813. A statue to commemorate his fame was erected in the Abbey Church grounds, Paisley, in 1874; and since then a statue to Robert Tannahill has been reared close by. EMIGRATION TO AMERICA. O Death! it 's no thy deed I mourn, Though oft my heart-strings thou hast torn; 'Tis worth and merit left forlorn, Life's ills to dree, Gars now the pearly, brackish burn Gush frae my e'e. Is there who feels the melting glow Of sympathy for ithers' woe? Come let our tears thegither flow; O join my mane! For Wilson, worthiest of us a', For aye is gane. He bravely strove 'gainst fortune's stream, While hope held forth ae distant gleam; Till dash'd and dash'd, time after time, On life's rough sea, He wept his thankless native clime, And sail'd away. The patriot bauld, the social brither, In him were sweetly join'd thegither; He knaves reprov'd, without a swither, In keenest satire, And taught what mankind owe each ither As sons of nature. If thou hast heard his wee bit “Wren” Wail forth its sorrow through the glen, Tell how his warm, descriptive pen Has thrill'd thy soul: His sensibility sae keen, He felt for all. Since now he 's gane, and Burns is deid, Ah! wha will tune the Scottish reed? Her thistle, dowie, hangs its head; Her harp's unstrung; While mountain, river, loch, and mead, Remain unsung. Fareweel, thou much neglected bard! These lines will speak my warm regard; While strangers on a foreign sward Thy worth hold dear, Still some kind heart thy name shall guard Unsullied here. EILD. A FRAGMENT. The rough hail rattles through the trees, The sullen lift low'rs gloomy gray, The trav'ller sees the swelling storm, And seeks the ale-house by the way. But, wae 's me! for yon widow'd wretch, Borne down with years and heavy care, Her sapless fingers scarce can nip The wither'd twigs to beet her fire. Thus youth and vigour fends itsel'; Its help, reciprocal, is sure, While dowless Eild, in poortith cauld, Is lonely left to stand the stoure. THE POOR BOWLMAN'S REMONSTRANCE. “The above was written on seeing the boys plaguing little Johnnie the Bowlman, while some who thought themselves men were reckoning it excellent sport.” —Tannahill. Through winter's cold and summer's heat, I earn my scanty fare; From morn till night, along the street, I cry my earthen ware. Then, O let pity sway your souls! And mock not that decrepitude Which draws me from my solitude To cry my plates and bowls! From thoughtless youth I often brook The trick and taunt of scorn, And though indiff'rence marks my look, My heart with grief is torn. Then, O let pity sway your souls! Nor sneer contempt in passing by; Nor mock, derisive, while I cry, “Come, buy my plates and bowls.” The potter moulds the passive clay To all the forms you see; And that same Pow'r that formèd you Hath likewise fashion'd me. Then, O let pity sway your souls!— Though needy, poor as poor can be, I stoop not to your charity, But cry my plates and bowls. THE PLUNKIN WEDDIN'. Plunkin kens a queer auld cock they ca' Rab, Wha has hoarded his hugger in coppers; Hauf his house is filled up wi' his wab, While the ither hauf looks like a broker's. Auld Rab had seen bonnie Ann Auchencloss Washin' claes at the Marshall's Lane dippin', Sae, he reckoned the profit an' loss If his house to a wife he should lippin. Syne he trysted a blue coat at the Cross,— It was Symington's best, wi' brass buttons; Wi' Wright's wig, that his gran'faither Rab Ross Had bequeathed, wi' shoe buckles an' stockin's. Rab took up the want, A local place-name. dressed, in the mirk, Creeping near Ann's backdoor in a hover,— “Look,” quoth the faither, “What ails that daft stirk?” Quo' the mither, “Come in for a bother.” But she guessed by the sheen o' his e'e, An' the queer way Rab aye glintet at her; So, “Gudeman, wheesht, lea' this wooin' wi' me, An' I 'll fix 't in a five minute's clatter,”— For she weel kent Rabbie's gear wasna sma'. Puir Ann gloomed; says her mam, “What's the matter?” “Mither, in this warl' I 'll ne'er wed ava, If my choice is confined to that creature.” But Rabbie wheetlit her out in the dark, Wi' his beard he was ne'er owre particular, Ettlin', if Ann gaed him a squeeze or a smirk, The jags o' his bristles would tickle her. They brocht hame braws for the bride, quite a load; Puir Ann wrocht, an' her mither sae wrocht her, That, before Martinmas morn, Abbey Boog Had united auld Rab to her dochter. They sent for yill in abundance frae Mair, An' a dram frae Lochheid's roun' the corner, Widow Rule's winnock gleamit like a fair Wi' pies, puddin's, and haggis extraord'nar'. They had drank Rab and Ann's health in ae glass, Sung, danced, feasted, and fuddled till mornin'; When Annie's haun' (out o' sicht) got a press, An' a whisper—“It 's time for adjournin'.” Then she reeled out o' the door in a jig, Wi' auld Rabbie hip-steppin' behint her; But the daunert bodie's gran'faither's wig Was pu'd aff on the door by a splinter. Rab reached hame saft and sair out o' breath, Through a hole at the foot o' his steadin', Crying—“Annie, fix the latch,—I fear scaith; I 've been bothert for days 'bout our beddin'.” Annie creeped into her bed like a lamb, An' was saftly asleep in a twinklin'; Tremblin', Rab ahint the door took his stan', Lest the rascals should burst up the fast'nin'. Wi' peep o' day, Ann flew up like a lark, Fried twa eggs wi' the ham she had skirlin'. “Is a breakfast to be first o' your wark, Ye young, wasterfu' jade?” Rab cried, snarlin'. “Hear ye,” says Ann, “I 'll tak' nane o' your snash”; “Deed,” quoth Rab, “I 'll ha'e nane o' yours either.” “Daft coof,—as sure's I 'm a maid an' a lass, I 'll gae scamperin' hame to my faither. Ye silly gouk, I think mair o' mysel' Than be deeved the day long wi' your havers, For your bald head 's aye covered wi' kell, An' your birsie beard 's dreepin' wi' slavers.” But noo, the racket frae less gaed to mair; Auld Rab lifted his hauns for correction, When young Ann whamelt him owre on the flair, An' flew hame for her faither's protection. Noo, the haill toun resounds wi' the clish-clash, Talk that 's bad baith for Rabbie and Annie; Tongue ne'er tell't, if, instead o' the young lass, Rab had cocket his wig for her grannie. THE RECRUITING SERVICE DRUM. I hate that drum's discordant sound, Parading round and round and round; To thoughtless youth it pleasure yields, And lures from cities and from fields, To sell their liberty for charms Of tawdry lace, and glitt'ring arms, And, when Ambition's voice commands, March, fight, and fall in foreign lands. I hate that drum's discordant sound, Parading round and round and round; To me it talks of ravaged plains, And burning towns, and ruined swains, And mangled limbs, and dying groans, And widows' tears, and orphans' moans, And all that Misery's hand bestows To swell the list of human woes. PRAYER UNDER AFFLICTION. Almighty Power, who wing'st the storm, And calm'st the raging wind, Restore health to my wasted form, And tranquillise my mind. For, ah! how poignant is the grief Which self-misconduct brings, When racking pains find no relief, And injur'd conscience stings. Let penitence forgiveness plead, Hear lenient mercy's claims, Thy justice let be satisfied, And blotted out my crimes. But should thy sacred law of right Seek life, a sacrifice, O! haste that awful, solemn night, When death shall veil mine eyes. THE FILIAL VOW. Why heaves my mother oft the deep-drawn sigh? Why starts the big tear glist'ning in her eye? Why oft retire to hide her bursting grief? Why seeks she not, nor seems to wish relief? 'Tis for my father, mould'ring with the dead, My brother, in bold manhood, lowly laid, And for the pains which age is doom'd to bear, She heaves the deep-drawn sigh, and drops the secret tear. Yes, partly these her gloomy thoughts employ, But mostly this o'erclouds her every joy: She grieves to think she may be burdensome, Now feeble, old, and tott'ring to the tomb. O hear me, Heaven! and record my vow; Its non-performance let Thy wrath pursue! I swear—Of what Thy providence may give, My mother shall her due maintenance have. 'Twas hers to guide me through life's early day, To point out virtue's path, and lead the way: Now, while her powers in frigid languor sleep, 'Tis mine to hand her down life's rugged steep, With all her little weaknesses to bear, Attentive, kind, to soothe her every care. 'Tis Nature bids, and truest pleasure flows From lessening an aged parent's woes. ODE TO JEALOUSY. Mark what demon hither bends, Gnawing still his finger-ends, Wrapt in contemplation deep, Wrathful, yet inclin'd to weep. Thy wizard gait, thy breath-check'd broken sigh, Thy burning cheeks, thy lips, black, wither'd, dry; Thy side-thrown glance, with wild malignant eye, Betray thy foul intent, infernal Jealousy. Hence, thou self-tormenting fiend, To thy spleen-dug cave descend, Fancying wrongs that never were, Rend thy bosom, tear thy hair; Brood, fell hate, within thy den, Come not near the haunts of men. Let man be faithful to his brother man, Nor, guileful, still revert kind Heaven's plan; Then slavish fear and mean distrust shall cease, And confidence confirm a lasting mental peace. THE TRIFLER'S SABBATH-DAY. Loud sounds the deep-mouthed parish bell, Religion kirkward hies, John lies in bed and counts each knell, And thinks 'tis time to rise. But, O how weak are man's resolves! His projects ill to keep, John thrusts his nose beneath the clothes, And dozes o'er asleep. Now fairy fancy plays her freaks Upon his sleep-swell'd brain; He dreams—he starts—he mutt'ring speaks, And waukens wi' a grane. He rubs his een—the clock strikes twelve— Impell'd by hunger's grup, One mighty effort backs resolve— He 's up—at last he 's up! Hunger appeased, his cutty pipe Employs his time till two,— And now he saunters through the house, And knows not what to do. He baits the trap—catches a mouse— He sports it round the floor; He swims it in a water tub— Gets glorious fun till our! And now of cats, and mice, and rats, He tells a thousand tricks, Till even dulness tires herself, For hark—the clock strikes six! Now view him in his easy chair Recline his pond'rous head; 'Tis eight—now Bessie rakes the fire, And John must go to bed! STANZAS. WRITTEN WITH A PENCIL ON THE GRAVESTONE OF A DEPARTED FRIEND. Stop, passenger—here muse a while: Think on his darksome, lone abode, Who late, like thee, did jocund smile, Now lies beneath this cold green sod. Art thou to vicious ways inclin'd, Pursuing pleasure's flow'ry road? Know—fell remorse shall rack thy mind, When tott'ring to thy cold green sod. If thou a friend to virtue art, Oft pitying burden'd misery's load; Like thee, he had a feeling heart Who lies beneath this cold green sod. With studious, philosophic eye He look'd through Nature up to God; His future hope his greatest joy, Who lies beneath this cold green sod. Go, passenger—revere this truth: A life well spent in doing good Soothes joyless age, and sprightly youth, When drooping o'er the cold green sod. THE HAUNTET WUD. IN IMITATION OF JOHN BARBOUR, AN OLD SCOTS POET. Quhy screim the crowis owr yonder wud, Witht loude and clamourynge dynne, Haf deifenynge the torrentis roare, Quhilk dashis owr yon linne? Quhy straye the flokis far outowr, Alang the stanery lee, And wil nocht graze anear the wud, Thof ryche the pasturis be? And quhy dis oft the sheipherdis dug, Gif that ane lamikyne straye, Ay yamf and yowl besyde the wud, Nae farthir yn wil gaye? “Marvil thee nocht at quhat thou seist,” The tremblynge rusticke sayde, “For yn that feindis-hauntet wud Hath guyltlesse blude been sched. “Thou seist far doun yon buschye howe, An eldrin castil greye, Witht teth of tyme, and weir of wyndis, Fast mouldiryng yn decaye. “'Twas ther the jealous Barrone livit, Witht Lady Anne hys wyfe; He fleichit hyr neatht that wudis dark glume, And revit hyr ther of lyffe. “And eir hyr fayre bodye was founde, The flesch cam fra the bane, The snailis sat, feistyng onne hyr cheikis, The spydiris velit hyr ein. “And evir syne nae beist nor byrde Will byde twa nichtis thair, For fearful yellis and screichis wylde Are heird throuch nicht sae dreir.” ODE. IN IMITATION OF PETER PINDAR (DR. WOLCOT). The simile 's a very useful thing— This, priests and poets needs must own; For when the clockwork of their brain runs down, A simile winds up the mental spring. For instance, when a priest does scan The fall of man, And all its consequences dire, He makes him first a little sportive pig,— So clean, so innocent, so trig,— And then an aged sow, deep wallowing in the mire! Yes, sure the simile's a useful thing; Another instance I will bring. Thou'st seen a cork tost on the rain-swell'd stream, Now up, now down, now whirl'd round and round, Yet still 'twould swim, And all the torrent's fury could not drown 't: So have I seen a forward, empty fop Tost in Wit's blanket, ridicul'd, et cetera; Yet, after all the banter, off he 'd hop, Quite confident in self-sufficiency. Ah! had kind Heaven, For a defence, Allow'd me half the brazen confidence That she to many a cork-brain'd fool hath given! ALLAN'S ALE. Come a' ye friendly, social pack, Wha meet with glee to club your plack, Attend while I rehearse a fact, That winna fail; Nae drink can raise a canty crack Like Allan's ale. It waukens wit, and makes as merry As England's far-famed Canterbury; Rich wines, frae Lisbon, or Canary, Let gentles hail, But we can be as brisk and airy Wi' Allan's ale. It bears the gree, I'se gi'e my aith, Of Widow Dunn's and Ralston's baith, Wha may cast by their brewing graith, Baith pat and pail, Since Paisley wisely puts mair faith In Allan's ale. Unlike the poor, sma' penny-wheep Whilk worthless, petty change-folk keep, O'er whilk mirth never deigned to peep, Sae sour and stale, I 've seen men joyous, frisk and leap, Wi' Allan's ale. Whether a friendly, social meeting, Or politicians thrang debating, Or benders blest your wizzens weeting, Mark well my tale, Ye 'll find nae drink half worth your getting Like Allan's ale. When bleak December's blasts do blaw, And Nature's face is co'er'd wi' snaw, Poor bodies scarce do work at a', The cauld's sae snell, But meet and drink their cares awa' Wi' Allan's ale. Let auld Kilmarnock make a fraise What she has done in better days, Her “threepenny” ance her fame could raise O'er muir and dale; But Paisley now may claim the praise Wi' Allan's ale. Let selfish wights impose their notions, And damn the man won't take their lessons, I scorn their threats, I scorn their cautions, Say what they will; Let friendship crown our best devotions Wi' Allan's ale. While sun, and moon, and stars endure, And aid wi' light “a random splore,” Still let each future social core Its praises tell: Adored aye, and for evermore, Be Allan's ale! ASSUMED SANCTITY. To W. ?. What need'st thou dread the end of sin, The dire reward of evil; Keep but that black infernal grin, 'Twill scar the very devil. SCOTCH DRINK. Let ither bards exhaust their stock Of heav'nly names, on heav'nly folk, And god and goddesses invoke To guide the pen, While, just as well, a barber's block Would ser' their en'. Nae muse ha'e I, like guide Scotch drink, It mak's the dormant saul to think, Gars wit and rhyme thegither clink In canty measure, And, even though half fou we wink, Inspires wi' pleasure. Whiles dulness stands for modest merit, And impudence for manly spirit; To ken what worth each does inherit, Just try the bottle, Send round the glass, and dinna spare it, Ye 'll see their mettle. O would the gods but grant my wish! My constant prayer would be for this: That love sincere, with health and peace, My lot they 'd clink in, With now and then the social joys Of friendly drinkin'. And when youth's rattlin' days are done, And age brings on life's afternoon, Then, like a simmer's setting sun, Brightly serene, Smiling, look back, and slidder down To rise again. THE BACCHANALIANS. Encircled in a cloud of smoke Sat the convivial core, Like lightning flashed the merry joke, The thundering laugh did roar. Blithe Bacchus pierced his favourite hoard, The sparkling glasses shine: “'Tis this,” they cry, “come, sweep the board, Which makes us all divine!” Apollo tuned the vocal shell, With song, with catch, and glee: The sonorous hall the notes did swell, And echoed merrily. Each sordid, selfish, little thought, For shame itself did drown; And social love, with every draught, Approved them for her own. “Come, fill another bumper up, And drink in Bacchus' praise, Who sent the kind, congenial cup, Such heavenly joys to raise!” Great Jove, quite mad to see such fun, At Bacchus 'gan to curse, And to remind them they were but men, Sent down the fiend Remorse. RICH GRIP-US. Rich Grip-us pretends he 's my patron and friend, That at all times to serve me he 's willing; But he looks down so sour on the suppliant poor, That I 'd starve ere I 'd ask him one shilling. MODE FOR ATTAINING A CHARACTER. If thou on earth wouldst live respected, In few words, here 's the way to make it: Get dog-thick with the parish priest, To all his foibles mould thy taste; What he condemns, do thou condemn, What he approves, do thou the same; Cant Scripture words in every case, “Salvashion, saunt, redemshion, grace”; But controverted points forbear, For thou mayst shew thy weakness there; Look grave, demure as any owl— A cheerful look might damn the whole; Gang rigid to the kirk on Sunday, With face as lang's a gothic window; But from these maxims shouldst thou sever, Poor profligate! thou 'rt lost for ever. THE GUINEA NOTE. WRITTEN ON THE BACK OF A GUINEA NOTE. Thou little badge of independence, Thou mak'st e'en pride dance mean attendance; Thou sure hast magic in thy looks; Gives poets taste for tasteless books; Makes lawyers lie, makes courtiers flatter; And wily statesmen patriots clatter; Makes ancient maids seem young again, At sixty, beauteous as sixteen; Makes foes turn friends, and friends turn foes, And drugmen brew the pois'ning dose, And ev'n as common say prevails, Thou mak'st e'en Justice tip the scales. THE MAN OF CHARACTER. Wee A? ?, self-sainted wight, If e'er he won to heaven, The veriest wretch, though black as pitch, May rest he 'll be forgiven: With holy pride he cocks his nose, And talks of honest dealings, For when our webs are at the close, He nips off two three shillings. PURSE-PROUD. I scorn the selfish, purse-proud—, Who piques himself on being rich With two-score pounds, late legacied, Saved by his half-starved father's greed— To former neighbours not one word! He bows obsequious to my Lord. In public see him—how he capers! Looks big—stops short—pulls out his papers, And from a silly, puppish dunce, Commences the great man at once. SILLER STANDS FOR SENSE. WRITTEN BY TANNAHILL, WHEN RESIDENT IN ENGLAND, ON A COUNTRY JUSTICE. What gars yon gentry gang wi' Jock, And ca' him Sir and Master? The greatest dunce, the biggest block, That ever Nature cuist her; Yet see, they 've placed this human stock Strict justice to dispense: Which plainly shows yon meikle folk Think siller stands for sense. THE CHOICE. Ye vot'ries of pleasure and ease, Proud, wasting in riot the day, Drive on your career as ye please, Let me follow a different way. The woodland, the mountain, and hill, With the birds singing sweet from the tree, The soul with serenity fill, And have pleasures more pleasing to me. When I see you parade through the streets, With affected, unnatural airs, I smile at your low, trifling gaits, And could heartily lend you my prayers. Great Jove! was it ever designed That man should his reason lay down, And barter the peace of his mind For the follies and fashions of town? I 'll retire to yon broom-covered fields, On the green mossy turf I 'll recline, The pleasures that solitude yields, Composure and peace shall be mine. There Thomson or Shenstone I 'll read, Well-pleased with each well-managed theme, With nothing to trouble my head, But ambition to imitate them. SUCCESSOR TO OLD CHARON. When the devil got notice old Charon was dead, He wished for some blockhead to row in his stead; For he feared one with intellect discoveries might make, Of his tortures and racks, t'other side of the lake; So for true native dulness and want of discernment, He sought the whole world, and gave John the preferment. THE MORALIST. “Barbarous!” cried John; in humanising mood, To Will, who 'd shot a blackbird in the wood; “The savage Indian pleads necessity, But thou, barbarian wretch! hast no such plea.” Hark!—click the alehouse door—his wife comes in: “Dear, help's man, John!—preserve me, what d 'ye mean? Six helpless bairns—the de'il confound your drouth!— Without ae bit to stop a single mouth.” “Get hame,” cried John, “else, jade! I'll kick your ?!” Sure such humanity is all a farce. PARODY ON “LULLABY.” WRITTEN ON SEEING THOMAS WILLOUGHBY, TRAGEDIAN, RATHER BELOW HIMSELF. Peaceful, slumb'ring in the ale-house, See the god-like Rollo lie; Drink outwits the best of fellows: Here lies poor Tom Willoughby. Where is stern King Richard's fury? Where is Osmond's blood-flushed eye? See these mighty men before ye, Sunk to poor Tom Willoughby. Pity 'tis that men of merit Thus such sterling worth destroy: O ye gods! did I inherit Half the pow'rs of Willoughby! THE PORTRAIT OF GUILT: IN IMITATION OF M. G. LEWIS. “Monk Lewis,” as he is familiarly known in literary references. 'Twas night, and the winds through the dark forest roar'd, From Heaven's wide cat'racts the torrents down pour'd, And blue lightnings flash'd on the eye; Demoniac howlings were heard in the air, With groans of deep anguish, and shrieks of despair, And hoarse thunders growl'd through the sky. Pale, breathless, and trembling, the dark villain stood, His hands and his clothes all bespotted with blood, His eyes wild with terror did stare; The earth yawned around him, and sulphurous blue, From the flame-boiling gaps, did expose to his view A gibbet and skeleton bare. With horror he shrunk from a prospect so dread, The blast swung the clanking chains over his head, The rattling bones sung in the wind; The lone bird of night from the abbey did cry, He look'd o'er his shoulder intending to fly, But a spectre stood ghastly behind. “Stop, deep hell-taught villain!” the ghost did exclaim, “With thy brother of guilt here to expiate thy crime, And atone for thy treacherous vow: 'Tis here thou shalt hang, to the vultures a prey, Till piece-meal they tear thee and bear thee away, And thy bones rot unburied below.” Now, closing all round him, fierce demons did throng, In sounds all unholy they howled their death-song, And the vultures around them did scream; Now clenching their claws in his fear-bristled hair, Loud yelling they bore him aloft in the air, And the murd'rer awoke—'twas a dream! A LESSON. Quoth gobbin Tom of Lancashire, To northern Jock, a lowland drover, “Those are foin kaise thai'rt driving there, They 've zure been fed on English clover.” “Foin kaise!” quoth Jock, “ye bleth'ring hash, De'il draw your nose as lang 's a sow's! That talk o' yours is queer-like trash; Foin kaise! poor gowk!—their names are koose.” The very fault which I in others see, Like kind, or worse, perhaps is seen in me. A RESOLVE. WRITTEN ON HEARING A FELLOW TELL SOME STORIES TO THE HURT OF HIS BEST FRIENDS. As secret 's the grave be the man whom I trust; What friendship imparts still let honour conceal: A plague on those babblers, their names be accurs'd! Still first to inquire, and the first to reveal. As open as day let me be with the man Who tells me my failings from motives upright; But when of those gossiping fools I meet one, Let me fold in my soul and be close as the night. LINES WRITTEN ON READING “CAMPBELL'S PLEASURES OF HOPE.” How seldom 'tis the Poet's happy lot T' inspire his readers with the fire he wrote; To strike those chords that wake the latent thrill, And wind the willing passions to his will. Yes, Campbell, sure that happy lot is thine, With fit expression, rich from Nature's mine, Like old Timotheus, skilful plac'd on high, To rouse revenge, or soothe to sympathy. Blest Bard! who chose no paltry, local theme,— Kind Hope through wide creation is the same. Yes, Afric's sons shall one day burst their chains, Will read thy lines, and bless thee for thy pains; Fame yet shall waft thy name to India's shore, Where next to Brahma thee they will adore; And hist'ry's page, exulting in thy praise, Will proudly hand thee down to future days: Detraction foil'd, reluctant quits her grip, And carping Envy silent bites her lip. ON A FLATTERER. I hate a flatt'rer as I hate the devil, But Tom's a very, very pleasing dog; Of course, let 's speak of him in terms more civil— I hate a flatt'rer as I hate a hog: Not but applause is music to mine ears— He is a knave who says he says he likes it not; But when, in friendship's guise, deceit appears, 'Twould fret a Stoic's frigid temper hot. WRITTEN ON SEEING A SPIDER DART OUT UPON A FLY. Let gang your grip, ye auld grim devil! Else with ae crush I 'll mak' you civil: Like debtor-bard in merchant's claw, The fient o' mercy ye 've at a'! Sae spite and malice (hard to ken 'em) Sit spewing out their secret venom:— Ah, hear!—poor buzzard 's roaring “Murder!” Let gang!—Na, faith!—Thou scorn'st my order!— Weel, tak' thou that!—vile, ruthless creature! For who but hates a savage nature?— Sic fate to ilk unsocial kebar Who lays a snare to wrang his neighbour. ON SEEING A FOP PASS AN OLD BEGGAR. He who, unmov'd, can hear the suppliant cry Of pallid wretch, plac'd on the pathway side, Nor deigns one pitying look, but passes by In all the pomp of self-adoring pride— So may some great man vex his little soul, When he, obsequious, makes his lowest bow; Turn from him with a look that says, “Vain fool,” And speak to some poor man whom he would shame to know. WRITTEN WITH A PENCIL IN A TAP-ROOM. This warld 's a tap-room owre and owre, Where ilk ane tak's his caper; Some taste the sweet, some drink the sour, As waiter Fate sees proper. Let mankind live, ae social core, And drap a' selfish quarr'lling, And when the Landlord ca's his score, May ilk ane's clink be sterling. A RHYMING RIDDLE. WRITTEN WHEN AT SCHOOL. My colour's brown, my shape 's uncouth, On ilka side I ha'e a mouth, And, strange to tell, I will devour My bulk of meat in half-an-hour. Answer.—The big, brown, unshapely nose of a well-known character, who took large quantities of snuff. Epitaphs. ON A FARTHING-GATHERER. Here lies Jamie Wight, who was wealthy and proud— Few shar'd his regard, and far fewer his goud; He lived unesteemed, and he died unlamented— The Kirk gat his gear, and auld Jamie is sainted! ON THOMAS BISSLAND. A GENTLEMAN WHOM INDIGENCE NEVER SOLICITED IN VAIN. Ever green be the sod o'er kind Tom of the Wood, For the poor man he ever supplied; We may weel say, alas! for our ain scant of grace, That we reck'd not his worth till he died: Though no rich marble bust mimics grief o'er his dust, Yet fond memory his virtue will save; Oft, at lone twilight hour, sad remembrance shall pour Her sorrows, unfeigned, o'er his grave. ON A CRABBED OLD MAID. Here slaethorn Mary's hurcheon bouk Resigns its fretful bristles: And is she dead? No—reader, look, Her grave 's o'ergrown wi' thistles. ON SEEING A ONCE WORTHY CHARACTER LYING INEBRIATED ON THE STREET. If loss of worth may draw the pitying tear, Stop, passenger, and pay that tribute here— Here lies, whom all with justice did commend, The rich man's pattern, and the poor man's friend; He cheer'd pale Indigence's bleak abode, He oft remov'd Misfortune's galling load; Nor was his bounty to one sect confin'd, His goodness beam'd alike on all mankind: Now, lost in folly, all his virtues sleep— Let 's mind his former worth, and o'er his frailties weep. Epigrams. DICK TO BOB. Cried Dick to Bob, “Great news to-day!” “Great news,” quoth Bob; “what great news, pray?” Said Dick, “Our gallant tars at sea Have gain'd a brilliant victory.” “Indeed!” cried Bob; “it may be true, But that, you know, is nothing new.” FRENCH INVASION. “French threats of invasion let Britons defy, And spike the proud frogs if our coast they should crawl on.” Yes, statesmen know well that our spirits are high— The financier has rais'd them two shillings per gallon. WOMAN'S TONGUE. Nature, impartial in her ends, When she made man the strongest, For scrimpet pith, to make amends, Made woman's tongue the longest. HA! DOCTOR. Ha! Doctor, your powders and potions give o'er, Nor boast of your knowledge in healing; For plainly we see all your skill is a fee, Since you'll lame any man for a shilling. In reference to the granting of a medical certificate of exemption from military service; the reason assigned usually being lameness.</field>
