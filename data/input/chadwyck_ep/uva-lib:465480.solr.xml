I O Lord, Who only art The Greatest and the Best, An ever-flowing Fount Whence Grace &amp; Glory, &amp; all Goodness springs: Afford Thy Spirit; Impart Thy gracious aid; devest My soul of sin, that she may mount To thee, and live above terrestrial things. II O Thou, Who didst inspire The Prophets, that did use In sacred Canto's heretofore To celebrate thy great and glorious Name, Fill now With sprightly fire My Heav'n-descended Muse, And grant that she may evermore Thy deathless praises to the World proclaim. To his much honored Friend JOHN BIRCH, Esq; One of His Majesties Justices of Peace for the County of Hereford, &amp;c. 1 Good Sir, Your noble favours to me shown When poor, and wrong'd by the malevolent: And since that I my Ministry lay down, Ungrateful were I, should I not resent. And oh, that I were able to express, Your living vertues, in a lively dress! 2 A poor man in the hollow of his hand Brought water to the Mycenean King; So I, who have but little at command, To you this slender Thank-oblation bring, In hope it may the like acceptance find From you, sith given with a Noble mind. 3 Poesie is divine, 'tis not of man, It's God that taught me Poems to compose; And he may write in Verse, who seldom can Have opportunities to preach in Prose. Sir, take his mite, the height of whose endeavor, Is to be humbly yours, and that for ever. From my study at Abergaveny Ian. 1. 1666. N. B. To the Right Worshipful, The Company of HABERDASHERS in LONDON, &amp;c. Worshipful, 1 Wonder you may, that I who am unknown To any of you, should presume to send So small a present (as I scarce dare own) To all of you, whose Deeds your Worth commend. But having found you generously free, This (I confess) humbly emboldned me. 2 True; I was one of Levi's turn'd-out Tribe, Who never durst against my conscience sin, Nor claw Church-livings with an unjust bribe, And stoutly swear I honestly came in; Your Presentations are not bought nor sold With eye-bewitching heart-corrupting gold. 3 If in the place whereto I have a call From God and you, I any good may do, As a weak Instrument, I trust I shall, Ascribe it wholly unto God and you. Heav'n crown you all, with all (excepting none) The blessings of the Foot-stool and the Throne. Which is the unfeigned desire of (Most Noble Patrons) Your most humble servant Nich. Billingsley. Awre, March 25. 1667. A TREASURY OF DIVINE RAPTURES. A 1. On Abba. Oh! I have sinn'd before the Judges face, And justice storms; so vile am I, so base, I dare not plead, and yet I cannot fly From Gods all-viewing, bright-refulgent eye. I have offended Heav'n, infring'd his Laws; And now methinks incensed Justice draws His keen Steletto, at one fatal blow, T'effect mine everlasting overthrow. And must thou then for ever be undone, Poor trembling Soul? make in to th'Judges Son, Remembrest not how his dear bloud was spilt Upon the Cross, to answer for thy guilt? How he was dead, entomb'd, rose, intercedes For thee, and how afresh for sin he bleeds. Get Christ thy friend, and thou wilt quickly see The breach made up, betwixt thy God and thee. Go in thy Saviors name, go make thy moan, And pour thy pray'rs before Gods gracious throne Beg his assisting Spirit so much the rather Because thou maist through it call Abba Father. God out of Christ is a consuming fire, In him our Father, granting our desire, In things that are consonant to his Will, And for our real good, how doth he fill Our lives with blessings, he hath Love for all Who can in truth him Abba Father call. He owns as sons, those that his Son do own, Believing on his Name; to them alone The golden Scepter of his pleased grace, He reacheth forth, them his sweet arms imbrace He bears with them, accepts of what they do, And gives them his Paternal Blessing too. Sinners made Sons! free Grace to this must move O here is the Meridian of Love! Mirror of Mercies! Rebels to be crown'd, And swine made sons, O this is Love profound 2. On an Abetter. Satans commands (oppos'd to Gods) are ten Which are observed by the most of men, This lying Prince heartens us on to ill, Tells us his Laws are easie to fulfil. But God's are hard, besides his pay is greater, And thus the Dev'l becomes the Souls Abetter. 3. On Ability. Man can do nothing of himself, unless God give him leave, 'tis wisdom to express If God so please, to morrow we'l pursue Such and such things. Once a presumptuous Jew Said thus t'his friends, to morrow Ile be blest And crown'd with mirth, the Bridal-chamber drest Resolv'd Lam, to frolick out the day With my fair Bride, and who dare say me nay? And when 'tis night, I do intend to meet, My Souls delight, within the Genial Sheet; I will, I will, whether God will or no: Blasphemous wretch! to morrow gone, both go To bed, but lo! before the Game was vy'd, Death struck the jovial Bridegroom and his Bride. 4. On Abjuration. In Baptism, we to Christ our souls betroth, The World, Flesh, Satan, do renounce by oath. But ah! our words prove wind, our minds do vary And we t'our Abjuration walk contrary. 5. On an Abcedary. The Worlds a School, and we to School are set To learn Love, in Afflictions Alphabet, That Christ-cross row, but ah! how dul! how slow Are we to learn? till God do make us know. O Heaven, I crave that thou wilt be my Tutor, And make thy Spirit of Grace my co-adjutor. 6. On Abridgment. The World's a Book in Folio, fairly writ With Gods own hand the creatures found in it Are Letters, spelling out the Authors Glory, And man's th'Abridgment of that ample story. 7. On Absence. Alas! alas! we know not how to prize A real good, while 'tis before our eyes: No sooner gone, oh then we can set forth Its praise, and prize it for it's real worth; But yet we soon forget our absent friends, And laud the present out of base self ends. Carendo potuts quam fruendo nos bona nostra intelligimus Cic. Poma fugientia sunt gratissima. Vanescit absens &amp; novus intrat amor. 8. On Absolution. God's Absolution is a full discharge Of sins, past, present and to come, at large: This to Gods People only doth belong, And serve to make their Faith when weak, more strong. Popish Indulgences, for future sins, Are meer Decoys, and Soul-beguiling Gins: Make men licentious impudent in evil, To go (if possible) beyond the Devil. Teach simple Souls to say, God gives us pardon Ev'n while they sin, was the like ever hard on? Good Lord forgive us, we have broke thy Law, The Pope's forgiveness, is not worth a Straw. Absolve potentially God only can, And therefore not the Pope, the Pope's a Man. 9. On Abstinence. Th' abstemious person's diet, is not large, He's one that feeds at frugal Natures charge, Forbears unlawful, yea and lawful things, Sometimes for the great benefit it brings; This fits for duty, is the bodies friend, How sweet when other graces it attend! Such as abstain from meat, but practise evils Are like meat-wanting, but sin-having Devils. 10. On Absurdity. To make a Garment for the Moon, To drein the Ocean with a Spoon, To build up Castles in the Ayr; Before soul Swine to cast Pearls fair, To paint the Dolphin in the Woods; Or Savage Boare in liquid Floods; To light a Candle at noon day; To seek for Water in the Sea: To set the Fox to keep the Geese; To wrest the Club from Hercules. To put the Cart before the Horse, To seek a Blessing in a Curse, Is held absurd, to think to win, A glorious Crown, yet live in Sin; Prepost'rous is, none can Heav'n gain, Without the price of labours pain. 11. On Abundance. The radiant Splendor of those things on earth Dazles our Eyes to things of Nobler birth; Care-cumbred Martha, cannot act like Mary, Forgets to seek that one thing necessary; How many are impov'rishd by their Riches, Made Spirit'aly poor, the World bewitches. But ah! how rare to see a man inherit A wealthy Purse, with an impov'rish'd Spirit. Let Abraham much respect to Hagar show, She will ere long over her Mistriss crow; Plenty of places maketh oftentimes, Men fouly guilty of nefandous crimes. Rich Sodom, was a Nurserie of sins, And Jeshurun when far, to kick begins, Nay, full-fed Israel committeth now Abomination, and hath broke her vow. Laodicea flow'd in wealthy store, And yet (alas!) was miserable poor. Paul in the midst of want knew how t'abound, And counted all things loss till Christ was found Had nothing, yet with all things was possest, None but the gracious Soul is truly blest. How full soever this my Cistern be, God's the grand-Fountain, nay, the Ocean-sea Of all enjoyments: All my Springs and Stream Are in, and from him; at his Golden beams My Candle's tin'd; thus faith on God doth pitch, It is his blessing onely can make rich: Fish the Disciples may, tug and take pain, But till Christ come, their labour is in vain; The gaping chinks and chasmes of my Soul, He can fill up, who is my All, my Whole. Esau had much, he, that God his can call With Jacob, more enjoys, for he hath all; These are rich Cab nets, but God's countenance, His Light, O that's the Jewel we enhance! A single God is infinitely sweeter, Then all deriv'd good things, and always better. O may I with my Substance honor thee, Great God! Marias ointment could not be Brought to a better Mart, then when 'twas shed Abroad, so frankly on her Saviours head; Dote not (my Soul) in God is all thy springs, On these poor earthly, drossy, dirty things. 12. On Abuse. Give, give, the Horse-leech cries, we more do crave, And yet do still abuse the things we have: This man abuses Honor, that his Riches, Him drink besots, this dainty fare bewitches; And is't not just with God to take from us His Blessings, seeing we abuse them thus? Nullum bonum est quo quis non male utarur impii Divina beneficia corrumpunt. 13. On an Academy. Some graceless ones that haunt those publick Schools, (Hobs-like) evade meer Atheists, Scripture-fools, Such as for holy ends improve their parts, May bless God for such Nurseries of Arts. 14. On Acceptation. Christ bears the names of Saints upon his Brest, Presents them to his Father, in request So brings he them, God through Christ will treat, And, parley with us from his Mercy-seat: He accepts what we do, therein delights, And makes us to become his Favourites. We to Gods eye in Christs bloud by reflexion, Seem of a sanguine, beautiful Complexion. So have I seen each object to the view, Through the red Glass seem of a ruddy hiew. 15. On Acceptation of persons. Not God, nor nature, death, nor devil do Respect mens persons, onely Man doth so, Persons should be regarded for their faith, Not faith for persons (as a wise man saith.) Accept of me in Christ, O God, my King, So wilt thou be well-pleas'd with what I bring. 16. On Accounts. Great God! when I would cast up the accounts Of all my sins, their number far surmounts, Th'hairs on my head, the Heavens Starry bands, Earths blades of grass, the Sea beleag'ring sands. Lord, onely thou the great Arithmetitian, Canst sum them up; let Christ be my Physician, His merits are infinite, with which he stops The mouth of Justice, those sanguineous drops That trickled down his wounds is balm to heal My soul; for pardon I through him appeal To thee, dear Lord, 'tis Mercy that I crave, Thy saving Mercy let thy servant have: 17. On an Accuser. The Devil, that grand accuser of our Souls, Hath not his name for nought, what bloudy scrouls Hath he against mans self, and now and than Accuseth man to God, yea God to man: Angels accuse us, and the Law likewise, The Judge himself accuses, Conscience flies In our guilt-blushing faces, sinners be Against us; none but Christ can set us free, From all our accusations, run my soul To Christ by faith, and Christ will make thee whole. 18. On Acquaintance. Worldly acquaintance mischief oft attends, 'Tis said, many acquaintance, but few friends My soul, acquaint thy self with God, and rest In peace, of all acquaintance his is best; This true friend neither can, nor will deceive thee Nor in an Orphan-state will ever leave thee, But give thee visits; promises they are His Bonds; go put those Bonds in suit by pray'r. 19. On an Acquittance. O God, our sins are debts, and more and more, We in thy Justice Books, still run on score, Can never pay, and we must therefore lie In Hells black prison to Eternity. But O we have a Surety (Christ) whose death Alone; can make offended Justice sheath His keen-edg'd sword; Love that transcends degree, Our King he dies to set us Rebels free: He suffred for our sins; we by his stripes Are heal'd, and from our eyes all tears he wipes. The Debt's discharg'd, to Justice nothing's due, As our acquittance, writ in bloud, doth shew. 20. On Actions. Do not the Silver-breasted Rivers go Back to the wealthy Seas from whence they flow? So to Gods glory must our Actions tend, As in him they begin, so must they end. As from the Sacred Fountain of his Grace They first took rise, so to their proper place They must retire, the Ocean of his Glory Must swallow up our Actions transitory; May I, what ever I assay to do, Make God my Alpha, and Omega too. 21. On an Adamant. Our hearts are like this unrelenting stone, Nothing can melt them, save the bloud alone Of the Messias: O sweet Jesus grant Thy bloud may mollifie my Adamant: Lord at thine hands a tender heart I crave, A heart of flesh, let me thy servant have; So shall I love thee, and adore thee still, And yield obedience to thy Heavenly will. 22. On Addition. God multiplies his Mercies more and more, Ungrateful we, who to our sins vast score Add new offences daily; but be't known, God hath large showres of vengeance to pour down Upon our guilty souls, unless we rent Our rocky hearts, and speedily repent. 23. On an Adjective. The World's an Adjective, it cannot stand, Without a Substantive, th'Almighties Hand: And I can nothing signifie at all Without Gods Grace, unpropt by it I fall. 24. On an Adieu. The Old man bids the World adieu, When he can stay no longer in it, He whom Gods Spirit did once renew, Had rather lose the World that win it. That he in Heaven with Christ may dwell, He longs to bid the World farewell. 25. On an Adjourn. Dear Lord! how apt are we t'adjourn The day and hour of our Return From sin to thee! from morn to noon We put it off, say 'tis too soon; And when lifes Sun is almost set, O then we dying thee forget. 26. On Admonition. Words seasonably spoke, are like unto Apples of Gold, in Silver Pictures set; And if well taken, O what good they do, They stir us up to duties we forget. We should not Admonition detest. The wise man saith 'tis needful for the best. Prou. 9. 9, 15, 12 27. On Adoption. We were not born Gods children, but so made; The Dev'le, we for our natural father had; Through Grace snatch'd from th'old Family of Hell, In Heavens noble Family Saints dwell; Are disoblig'd from sin, new names receive, And an Estate which they shall never leave, Pleasant and safe; to an inheritance In light, kept for them; them doth he advance, The heirs shall never die, for be it known Eternitie's a Jewel of their Crown. Man, he Adopts a defect to supply; God, out of pity, not necessity. He had an only Son, nor lov'd he any Like him, Man but one heir adopts, he many; Hath Land for all; Man soon adopts a Son, A Deed is sealed, and the thing is don, But when God was about to constitute Us Sons and Heirs, his wisdom could find out No easie way, he could not seal a Deed But by his own Sons bloud, his Son must bleed. Men on adopted persons entail do Their Land, but God his Land and himself too. O what great Portions to Gods Heirs do fall, Heaven's theirs, Glory is theirs, yea, God and All How precious are their Names, their Prayrs Tears, blood In Gods esteem, and O that Satans brood, Nay Traytors should be made Heirs to the Crown, Such Love was never to the Angels shown. And O what Sweets from out the Gospel flower May a Believer suck! when in our gore We tumbling lay, and were with sin bemir'd, And neither deserv'd love, nor love desir'd; He lov'd us then, when we had soild, defac'd His Image, broke his Law, us he embrac'd, When we by Sin our Pedigree had lost, He did restore it to us to his cost. 28. On Adoration. Angels and Saints, my fellow-creatures be, And therefore shall not be ador'd by me; God who hath made me, and did me restore, Him only, and none else I must adore. 29. On Advancement. 1 Our Blest Redeemer fanci'd, Humility even so, Our way to be Advanced, Must be by being low. 2 He had all in Fruition, Yet for our sakes did pitch, Upon a mean condition, That us he might enrich. 3 This Prince inestimable By whom the World is swaid, Was in a homely Stable, Born of a Mother-Maid. 4 The Heav'ns could not contain him, Yet him a cratch did hold; Fools did indeed disdain him, But wise men brought him Gold. 5 He fasted, and was tempted, To feast us with his Grace, That we might be exempted, Opprest with griefs he was. 6 W'are by his shame renowned And eased by his pain; We by his Cross are Crowned, And by his loss we gain. 7 On Earth, he was a stranger, That we might be Gods Sons; He past through Death and danger, To make us sit on Thrones. All Glory be to him therefore, Ascrib'd, both now and evermore. 30. On Advantage. The World in one Scale, blessed Jesus lays, The Soul in t'other, and the Soul out-weighs To gain the World, and lose the precious Soul, Is such a vantage, as the damn'd condole. 31. On an Adventure. O how sad were my Adventures! Thus to forfeit mine Indentures, But to pay my just Debentures, Into Bond my Saviour enters. O my Soul, sin no more, Lest worse fall then did before. Magnum est memorabile facinus non sit absque periculo. Tertul. 32. On an Adverb. Live, thats and Act, but much Divinity Lies couch'd in this one Adverb holily. 33. On Adversity. The Sts. like Glo-worms, in the darkest night Of sad afflictions, do reflect most bright, Rue is the Herb of Grace, oft times our woe Becomes our weal, our Saviour found it so; For first he Vinegar and Gall drank down O'th' Cross, e're he receiv'd his glorious Crown: Mourning lasts but till morning, nightly sorrow Is Herald to a joyful shining morrow. Now Storms arise, anon a prosperous Gale, Fans curteous blasts, upon the swelling Sail. 34. On Adultery. All other sins may be subdu'd by might, Adult'rate mixtures only are by flight; Flee Fornication, holy Paul doth say, Yet O how many like fed Horses neigh After their neighbours Mates: the Brownist strives For all things to be common, Ergo Wives. 35. On an Advocate. O happy Mary for whom Jesus pleads, Judas condemns, but he commends thy deeds Judas accuse, and slander while thou wilt, Jesus acquits, and clears us of our guilt. Earth judges evil, what Heav'n pronounceth good The moving Rhet'rick of our Advocates blood, Pleads strongly for us, and we need not fear, Though all the Devil's in Hell against us were. Our Sav'ours bloud which on the Cross was spilt, Quenches Gods wrath, and satisfies for guilt. Such as for help unto the Mother run, Shall have but little succor from the Son. 36. On Affection. Kind Mary pours an Alabster Box, Of precious Spikenard on her Saviours feet, And with her chiefest Ornament, her Locks, She wipes them, humbleness and zeal her meet. O how doth love in Maries heart abound, She serves God, not by th'ounce, but by the pound! 37. On Afflictions. How light afflictions are! how transitory, Compared to the weight of endless glory! Or if compar'd to sin, or if to Hell, And yet when our proud hearts do rise and swell, We think them heavy, for they press us down, Many dislike the Cross, but not the Crown: Tis true affliction hath a vexing sting, But know withal, it hath a flying wing; The shadows of the night shall flee away, And we shall see an everlasting day; Afflict'ons water like a Land-flood shall Be soon dry'd up, the Saints rise by their fall, Their night-cloaths flung aside, they shall be drest In rich array, and be for ever blest. 38. On Agents. Satannick Agents, are rubbish to scour The Vessels of Gods house, Ashur had pow'r To vex Gods Israel, this being done The smarting rod into the fire is thrown. 'Tis said, the rod of wicked ones shall not Alway remain upon the righteous lot. 39. On Air. The Throne of night and day, the airy main, The mint of winds, the treasures house of rain, Becomes the common dish, (so Heaven decreed) Whereon all creatures every moment feed. 40. On an Alarm. Sound an Alarm, thy Messengers fulfil, Thy pleasure Lord, yet men are drowzy still. O when thy second Trumpet shall be sounded, The unbelieving World shall be confounded. 41. On an Albe. This vestment in it self is pure from sin, But yet not holy, nor are all within That wear't, Lord make me inwardly sincere, No matter then what outwardly I wear. 42. On an Alehouse. Those common Quagmires of all naughtiness, And rendezvouz for such a love excess: All sober men decline, the lowzie Alehouse Fits men first for the Gaol, and next the Gallows. 43. On an Alembick. Mans heart's a Chymick, Limbeck that distils The tears of grief warm'd with the sense of ills; O when for sin, my Spirit'al Stillatory, Drops holy tears, thine be, O Lord the Glory. 44. On Almes. We to receive Gods Blessings in, have store Or hands (like B[illeg.]us,) to relieve the poor We have but one to use, and that alas! Is withered too, as Jeroboams was. Its not enough to say, God help, and give Good words, unless the hungry we relieve; The Poor like the Camelion cannot feed Upon light Air: Give unto such as need; Let Artaxerxes like our open Palms, Be liberal in distributing Alms. 45. On Allowance. Our daily Bread, is from Gods daily care, Who feeds the wing'd Citizens of the Air: Doth he not also cloath us day by day, Who decks the Lillies in such rich aray? Thus having food, the commons God hath sent, And raiment too, let's be there with content. 46. On an Altar. Great God! upon the Altar of my heart, I offer up the Sacrifice of praise To thee; be pleas'd to take it in good part, And make me glorifie thy Name always: Let who will prize Altars of Wood or Stone, There's no such Altar as a Fleshly one. 47. On Ambition. Desires that but the Poles no limits know, How they transport that man in whom they grow Such as aspire at Honors highest pitch, Like gazing Thales tumble down the Ditch. Great God! when my ambitious thoughts would climb To get a name by works compos'd of slime, Check thou my sinful pride, let me not reach At such a union as may cause a breach; Nor close with sin, but still to minde recall Great Babels building, was great Babels fall. Quo fortunatius erexit ac levati[illeg.] humanas opes, hoc se supprimere magis selicem decet. Sen. Trag. 6. Sequitur suterbos ultor a [illeg.]ergo Deus. ???()?? ??????? ()??? ???? magna moles magna ruina. 48. On Almost. Alas! how many have salvation lost, For want of thorough Reformation? The almost Christ'an shall be sav'd almost, But quite to all eternity undone. The Crown belongs to such as persevere, As good never a whit, as ne're the neer. 49. On Alpha and Omega. Of all thy labors, and intentions, see That God thy Alpha and Omega be. He that's the Alpha of all Mercies, shall Be the Omega of my service all. 50. On Amen. It gives assent to what before was spoken, Tis an assuring, assevering Token. Let's pray in faith, that when conclude we do With our Amen, Heav'n may say Amen too. 51. On Amendment. Augustus said of Galba's crooked back, Warn thee I can, better I cannot make: God in his goodness Ministers doth send us, To warn us but it is his grace must mend us. If we remend our lives, and by Gods grace Reform what is a miss, he will imbrace Us in his loving armes, lay by his Rod, And be to us a reconciled God. 52. On Anarchy. The members have their head; the Stars the Sun, Nature abhors kingless confusion. 53. On Anathema. Oh to b'Anathematiz'd And deliver'd up to Satan, Is, if rightly exercis'd, Worse than what befell to Dathan. Serious censures were but sports, Heretofore in some mens Courts. 54. On Anotamy. Substract Christ and his Members, holy ones, The world is nothing but a Trunk of bones. 55. On an Anchor. Who upwards on his God hopes Anchor casts, Can triumph in the midst of stormy blasts. 56. On Angels. Angels heav'ns nobles; those bright flaming powr's, Untainted Spirits, are the Saints Servitors, While here they live, and when of life bereaven, Those blessed Convoys carry them to heaven. Thus they attended Abram, Daniel, Mary, And Laz'rus when dead, did to glory carry. Saints by creation are than Angels lower, But Saints above them by adoption soar. 57. On Anger. Morosus is like Flax, or Gun-powder, No sooner touch'd but he is all on fire; And raging, not unlike the furious wind. Vents out the wilde distempers of his mind. Anger is a short madness, it suspends The use of Reason, it estrangeth Friends. Be angry, there's the reins; angry at sin, But sin not, there's the bridle curbs us in. Hearken to Socrates, if thou wouldst fly Rash Anger, think on Gods all-viewing eye. As the Divine Philosopher doth say, The best way to lay Anger, is delay. Maximum iræ remedium est mora. See Sen. 58. On an Angler. God is an Angler, so is Satan too, He takes to save, but Satan to undo. 59. On Antichrist. Peter lays by his sword, and takes the Keyes, The Pope lays by his Keyes, and now adayes Falls to his sword; yet many to him flock, As if he had the Key t'undo Heav'ns lock. 60. On an Antidote. Gods sacred Word is, and hath ever bin A sov'raign Antidote against all sin. Lord, if thy med'cinable Word dispell Sins venom from my heart, I shall be well. 61. On Antipathy. The strong-rib'd Oak bears an antipathie Gainst the pale Olive; and the thrifty Bee Against the pilfring Wasp; discord doth breed Betwixt the Serpents, and the Womans seed; But most of all in man, mans flesh and blood Is enmity against God, and what is good. 62. On Antiquity. What is most ancient, is the truest Text, We read first God says, and the devil says next. What God affirms, the Tempter he denies; Gods truths are elder than the Devils lies. 63. On Ants. Seest thou these little Patterns of great pain, Lugg in their mouths their mighty loads of grain And fill their hollow-vaulted Cells, that so (While others pine) they may with plenty flow. Who in the winter would not suffer want, Must labor in the summer with the Ant. 64. On an Ape. Satan Gods Ape, that Prince of darkness can Shine like an Angel, to delude poor man. 65. On an Apparitor. Summond by death, th'Apparitor of Heaven, Appear we must, and an account be given. 66. On Apparel. Adam he sins, as soon as he preceives This shame, he makes him breeches of fig-leavs And afterwards he clothes with coats of skins His nakedness, but could not hide his sins. Thus man at first for need did clothes invent, Which since are us'd for pomp and ornament; Gorgious attire, and silken braverie, Is but the badge of our desert to die; What thief was ever of his Halter proud, Although a silken one were him allow'd? If so, methinks our proud fantastick Jacks, Should blush to carry all upon their backs, As of his learning Bias said, I bear All mine with me, so they of what they wear, Yet oft they stand, for all their lofty looks Deeply recorded in their Mercers books: Fair feathers now adays do make fair Fowls, Bodies are better cloath'd alas! then Souls, O if Christs righteous Robes my soul adorn, No matter though my clothes were thred-bare worn. Stu[illeg.]ssimus est, qui hominem ex vestibus estimat. Externa non commendant hominem. Cic. Quanto ornatior tanto nequitior. Heu nunc splendidus vestitus discolor animus. Marcel. 67. On the Appetite. How dull to good is our souls appetite? But ah! what's bad we relish with delight. 68. On an Apple. One Apple did undoe our Grandam Eve, And the whole world, yet daily we receive Forbidden fruits; alas! unwholsom food We love, and loath what is intirely good. 69. On the Apple of the eye. Gods people are the Apple of his eye, O do not make this tender Apple cry; God his eye's Apple charily doth keep, O how it grieves him when 'tis made to weep! 70. On Application. The skilful Preacher having cleard his Text, Derives fit Doctrines thence, applies it next, The boy the explication onely bends, Fits for the mark, but application sends The arrows home: how Davids heart began To sink, when Nathan said, Thou art the man. 71. On Apostacy. We are the Lord of hosts his armed bands, And the Church is the field; us Christ commands The Word &amp; Sacraments our colours be; The Colonie of Saints our Companie; Who fly this Field, revolt from this Commander Forsake this Colour, from this comp'ny wander By damnd Apostacie, to serve the Devil, Hells Prince, and first original of evil, Christ'an'ties, foes, Religions grand disgrace, These are, besides, O how do they debase, And of a glorious Crown bereave themselves, Incur Gods heavy wrath, nefandous Elves? Such as from Christ to hels black Monarch run Shall find him cruel, and themselves undone. 72. On the Apostles. Christs Vicars, the Apostles equal were For Rule, Power, Honor, Peter did not bear Supremacy; all did in gifts excell, Yet one (and he the richest) went to Hell. 73. On an Arbitrator. Christ Jesus is the onely Arbiter, By whom to God we reconciled are. 74. On an Arch-Bishop. Christ is the true Arch-Bishop of our souls, He oversees, and our Estate condoles. 75. On an Archer. The devils an Archer, &amp; mans heart the white On which his fi'ry Darts of Trials light. 76. On an Argument. To seek and save lost sinners Christ is come, The argument that mov'd him was drawn from The Topicks of his Love, there was alas! No mer't in us to bring such things to pass. 77. On Arithmetick. Our sins to such a reck'ning are amounted, As cannot by the numb'ring Art be counted. 78. On an Ark. When the rebellious world for sin was drownd Just Noah was preserved safe and sound. O wonderful! the wave-supported Ark, Him, his, and some of all kinds did imbark. Christ is the Ark, and such as are in him, They shall (when others sink) be sure to swim: The Ark is Gods Church, who out of it are found Shall not be saved, but ingulfd and drown'd In his wraths deluge; the Pitch represents Love, which the Members of the Church cements And knits together; as without, within The Ark was pitch'd; so open and unseen Is every Christians love, to let us know Their love is true, as well as love in show. Blest Pitch! which not defileth, but the more Tis touch'd, it makes more Holy than before: The Ark had divers rooms, the Churches borders Hath men of divers gifts, degrees, and orders. The Ark held Beasts unclean, as well as clean, Some that are in the true Church live in sin: The Gospel is the window in the Ark, Preaching the light, enlightening the dark And shady understanding, that imparts So bright a lustre as revives mens hearts. Christ is the door that appertains thereto, See thou do not in at a wrong door go. The Church (as was the Ark) is very large, Where of Christ (as the head) takes special charge The Flood doth the Baptismal water shew, Which kills the old man, and preserves the new; In fine, the Ark was tossed to and fro, By the cariering Flouds, now sinks as low As Hells profunditude, but by and by It seems to kiss the Star-embroidered skie; Ev'n so th'militant Church which Christ doth own With justling waves is tumbled up &amp; down Yea ev'ry Saint is this, and that way hurld, Toss'd like a foot-ball by the mad-cap World Toss'd by the pamper'd flesh, toss'd by the Devil That grand Tartarian Counselor to evil, Toss'd by enchanting sin which soon would rend us In pieces, if our God did not defend us; But guided and preserv'd through Gods good grace We spit defiance in our enemies face. Ark-like the Church, rising by falls, out-braves The churlish threats of the insulting Waves. The more the Flouds of persecution rise, They drive the Ark the nearer to the Skies, And when the raging Tide shall cease to roar, And waters ebb, this Ark shall land on shore: This Ark which storms could never ruinate, Shall rest on the Cælestial Ararat. This Ark by the Almighties guidance driven, Shall land ev'n in that peaceful haven, Heaven. The Ark toss'd Saints shall one day be possest Of lasting glory, and eternal rest, Eternal rest; a rest that doth remain For them, by them expected not in vain. O blessed rest! by which we shall be freed From woes and foes, O there's a rest indeed! To which Heav'n bring us, who by Faith partake Of Christ his merits, for his own names sake. 79. On Armour. Gods Armour is of proof, against all evill Shot at us from the world, the Flesh, the Devil, His Helmet, Brest-plate, Shield, Sword, Girdle, Shoes, Will both defend us, and offend our foes. 80. On an Arrest. Death is a Serjeant, and he Warrants brings For our Arrest, from the great King of Kings. The greatest and the least, the worst the best, Have sinned, and must submit to deaths Arrest. 81. On an Arrow. O when God sends his Arrows from his Bow, It must needs work a speedy overthrow; When from his twanging Bow the Dev'l lets fly Tentation's Arrow, God can put it by. 82. On Arts. Life's short, but Art is long; ? ??? ????? ????? ?????. Hyp. Natural parts Are by the study of the Liberal Arts Very much heightned: but Arts golden Ring Set with Grace Di'mond is a glorious thing. 83. On Articles. Christ by his death hath cancel'd Justice scrouls Of Articles, drawn up against our souls. 84. On Artillery. My soul groan thunder, let thy pray'rs &amp; tears Be thine Artillery, to storm Gods ears. 85. On Ascension. Christ by Angels was at ended, When he into Heav'n ascended; At the Resurrections morn, Thither shall the Saints be born. 86. On Ashes. Ashes hides fire, what God for us hath done We hide in th'ashes of Oblivion. 87. On Asking. Who asks shall have, if Lord, it be thy task To grant, well may I make it mine to ask. 88. On an Ass. Men blame the Ass for creeping on the Road Yet go more sluggish in the ways of God. 89. On an Assault. Faiths shield is good against the dev'ls assault, Yet oft we want it through our own default. 90. On an Assize. The grand Assize draws on, the Judge is just, And by his Verdict stand or fall we must. 91. On Assistance. O God, if thou withdraw thy gracious hand From us, we fall; if thou assist, we stand. 92. On Assurance. Assurance that Christ is ours may be gain'd, The Saints have it desir'd, to it attain'd; Some more, some less, there are degrees we know Sometimes it ebbs, always it doth not flow. Assistance (which few have) is a rare Gem. God from his people, for to humble them, Sometimes withdraws it, through our carelesness Sometimes we want it, and our Christian peace. O how the dev'l disturbs! when once we meet With this Assurance, oh tis very sweet! W'oft hang our harps upon the limber willows, And weep (as Isr'el) by the water-billows For want of this; this Wine of Paradise, Revives the heart, how comfortable is Gods smile! Assurance makes the low sublime, And puts a man in heav'n before his time. Assurance is exceeding profitable; It makes a Christian strenuous and able For service, free to do what must be done. Faith makes a Christian walk, Assurance run. Assurance is a Flow'r that only grows In a pure heart, a spring whence comfort flows: A Whetstone to the Graces, Hope, Love, Zeal; A weight that of obedienre moves each Wheel, Be much in duty; keep thy consc'ence pure, Act faith, and thou hast made thy calling sure. 93. On Astrologie. Astronomy. Astrol'gy shows the Stars effects and force, Astronomy, their Measure, Motions, Course, And though this hath its being from the other, I like the Daughter, love who will the Mother. 94. On Atheists. Audacious Atheists to the world proclaim, They love such deeds, as might the De'il shame Atheists are worse then Devils; Devils do Believe there is a God, and tremble too; Those say, there is no God, who doth take care Of things below, have neither faith nor fear. The Devil quakes at the Day of Judgment; they Deride it, which will shortly them dismay. Strange! ev'n the Sons their sire in sins excell; What! Atheists here on Earth, when none in Hell. 95. On Attonement. We had offended Heav'n; deserved Hell, Christ an attonement makes, &amp; all is well. 96. On Augmentation. Who worketh out with fear his own salvation, This spirit'al living, gets an augmentation. 97. On Attributes. God single is, as being uncompounded, He's infinite, and therefore is unbounded; Immutable, th'Eternal, Three in one, Who by his back-parts onely can be known; Most wise, most strong, most true, most good, most just, Most merciful, believe in him we must; Perfect, and bless'd, and glorious is he, O if this God be ours, how blest are we! 98. On Auricular confession. The Scripture bids, and what it bids is best, Confess to God, not to the Popish Priest; Auricular confession taught in schools, How it ensnares the consciences of fools! What is it but a superstitious Gin To nourish, yea, and harden men in sin. My soul confess thy sins to God alone, And he will pardon what thou hast misdone. 99. On Authority. The Law's Authority, depends On God, the mighty King of Kings, And this exceedingly commends, Its worth above all humane things: How precious is the Law of God? My soul upon it always plod. 100. Of the Authors of things, according to Scripture. God by his pow'r (which may not be withstood, Created all things admirably good: He fram'd the first of men out of the ground, Gave him a reas'ning soul, by which he found Out many Arts and Sciences; none doubt But Moses found the use of Letters out, First Poesie compos'd, penn'd Histories: Tubal the crooked Harp did first devise. Musical Instruments David invented, Philosophy in Jewry first was minted. Egypt found Astrology, Arithmetick, As also Medicine to heal the sick. First were the Pers'ans fam'd for Magick Skill, Moses first Law-giver divulg'd Gods will? Egypt first own'd the Government by Kings; The Hebrew Commonwealths; Servitude spring From Canaan; the Jews the Year out found, And its 12 months, before the world was drown'd Meek Moses found out Instruments of War, As Cain of Husbandry; first Vine-dresser Old Noah was; Adam first names devis'd For living things; Abel first sacrific'd. Adam first cloath'd himself with Skins of beasts Cain the first City built; of Ships and Chests Noah was Author. Gods Church was at first In Adams family, both bred and nurst. The faithfuls Father first did circumcise; Christs Herald John, did first of all baptize With Baptism of repentance; Christ went higher, Baptizing with the Holy Ghost and Fire. By Moses, Aaron (so God appointed) Was to the High-priests Office first anointed. Noah first built an Altar to the Lord, And thereon offred of his own accord, An Holo-caust. The Prince of Hell the Devil, He is the principle, and root of evil. Of the first Authors of things, according to profane Authors. The Æginetans first of all stamp'd Money; First Aristeus taught the use of Honey. The first Tooth-drawer Æsculapius was; Anaximander found the Hour-glass. Angæas (though a King) first dungd the ground; The use of Bellows Anacharsis found. Anchus of Ovens to bake Bread withal: First Anagallis playd with Tennis-ball. Architas, Rattles; Belgians Wains first made, Boetius taught the Coblers subtile Trade. Corses first shav'd his Beard; Dædalus Shops Invented; Danaus Wells; Grecians Tops: Icarus Sayls; Perillus Bulls of Brass; Thon Drugs, Pan Pipes, Sinon the Looking-glass. Phænicians Slings, Scythians Arrows, Bowes; Cyneras Pinsers, Hammers, Anvils, Crowes Devised first; no more I will make known, Who would know more, may search See Pliny, Polydore, Virgil, Panryrol, &amp;c. as I have done. 101. On Autumn. The Sylvan quire cease their harmonious notes, And sullen forrests d'on their yellow coats; Ceres bright locks are shorn; the mellow fruits Are torn from laden boughs; their summer sutes The sapless branches d'off, the gaudy ground Is now disrob'd, the year with plenty crown'd. Great God thou sowst thy words immortal seed On the ground of our hearts, but ah! they breed The weeds of sin, in us these weeds destroy, That we a joyful Harvest may enjoy. 102. On Awe. Should God from Sinai thunder forth his Law, (As once) 'twould strike us with a dreadful aw, Since he in Gospel-mildness doth appear, O let us serve him with an holy fear. 103. On an Axe. The Axe is heavy, sharp, to cut and hew In pieces for the fire, or else to square, The Axe without the hand can nothing do; Gods Judgments and his Comminations are His Axe in those respects, and every Tree That brings not forth good fruit, hew down and burn'd shal be. 104. On an Axel-tree. The Nations Axel-tree doth ev'n begin To sink under the pressing weight of sin, O Christ the Saviour of the World be pleas'd To bear our burden, and we shall be eas'd. B 1. On Babel. While the presumpt'ous world, swoln big with pride Strove to enhance their names, and fondly try'd To build a Tower, whose ambitions spire Might kiss the Skies; Jehova in his ire Dismounts his awful Throne, doth quickly quell Their rash attempts to teach them to rebell tongues; Against his Sov'raign power, confounds their (Before but one) and they'r assembled throngs He cleerly routs; enforcing them to run Abroad the world, so leave their work undon: Thus did the means they use, as safe and sure T'avoid dispertion, the same procure: Thus God will bring to naught their counsels still, Who act contrary to his mind and will: Great God! when my unlimited desires Prompt me to ill, quench quench those raging fires, O let the ill success of Babels Tower, Tame my proud heart, &amp; bring it one peg lower, And if I must needs lofty Structures raise, Grant I may seek thy glory, not mens praise. 2. On a Baby. Natures Epitome, lifes dawn; a thrumb Of man, forsakes the chamber of the womb, To hang upon the brest, and loves to be Sung to, and dandled on the mothers knee: Nothing will sooner still its tear-throat cries Then crackling rattles, and fond lullabies. Man at the best is easily beguil'd With flattering pleasures like the whimpering child, Alas! how flux! how fading are the joys Which are engendred, by vain trifling toys. The world presents us with; Soul to thy rest Return, King Ps. 116. 17. David's lullaby is best. 3. On Back-biting. A good name upon earth is no small bliss, No chain of Pearl doth so adorn as this; To whom and what you speak of men be wary; Sland'rers are Devils The Greek word for Devil, signifies slanderer, 1 Tim. 3. 11. ?? ?????????, not slanderers, in the Greek it is not Devils.; O be exceeding chary And very tender of a mans good name, He acts the Devils part, that doth defame: The wounds inflicted by a sland'rous tongue Can no Physitian heal; yet will the wrong That's done t'another many times rebound Upon the shooters soul, he that doth wound The reputation of his neighbour shall Find in the end himself, hurt worst of all: Such bury men alive (oh cruelty!) Tis an irrepariable injurie; Let us from calumny, as from the Devil flee. 4. On Back-sliding. Ioash was good, while his good Unckle reign'd, But when he dy'd, O how was Joash staind With foul Idolatry; he did interr Religion in his Unckle's Sepulcher. We live in the Leass fall; how many tast Of Heav'nly gifts, yet slink away at last, A double Lamp, the word and spirit may Enlighten men, who after fall away Wholy and finally; Lord! work in me A thorough-work of grace, let me not be An Alch'my Christ'an, make me sound in heart, And let not me from thy Statutes depart: That which doth in Hypocrisie begin, Ends in Apostacy, that hellish sin: Lord! make me persevere, the race to run, And perfect in me what thou hast begun; That so, I may not, when I am almost At hav'n be Ship-wrack'd, and for ever lost. Domine quod cepisti perfice, ne in portum naufragum accidàt. Beza. 5. On a Bag of Money. Iudas hath got the bag, the bag hath got Judas; 'tis hard to bear the bag and not Be covetous, the heart's not fill'd with pelf; Judas is Burser, and he shuts himself Into his Pouch; Qui tenet marsupium tenetur a marsupio. Amb. the more he hath, the more He covets: the Apostles that were poor, Are not so having; Judas has the Coyn, Yet if he have not more, he will purloyn, And filch it: ah! what satisfaction can These outward things afford the heart of man? The Bag is given to the worst of men Most commonly; Judas had better been Without the Bag, than have the Bag, and have The Dev'l with it; Christ our Redeemer gave The Bag to Judas, and he gave the rest Of his Apostles Grace, now which sped best? Judas he bore the Bag, and yet behold He is accurst, Heav'n with a key of gold Cannot be opend, sooner Hell gate may; Despairing Judas makes himself away. And now farewel his Bag with Bulloin cramd, The wretch must go to hell, and there be damnd. Better Gods blessing with an empty purse, Than one well-lin'd, attended with a curse. 6. On a Ball. The worlds a Ball, made up of quarters four, Asia, Africa, Europe, America. And with the spangled Heavn bequilted ore; Pleasure, Honor, and Riches are its all, Which though the earth stands still, still rise and fall; Square dealings can scarce any where be found, The reason is, because the world is round. 7. On a Ballance. Theudas would to himself some-body seem, So we do of our selves too well esteem; Laid in the ballance of the Sanctuary, Alas! we are too light, no weight we carry. 8. On Balm. Balm is an Emblem of our Saviors blood, As that cures wounds, so this our sov'raign good To heal sins ulcer, Justice doth it calm. How sweet! how precious is Gileads balm! This cures the Serpents biting; this doth save, By this, we into heav'n an entrance have. O sinner, thou hast got a gangren'd soul, This Balm apply'd by faith, wil make thee whole. But few there are to whom Christ is reveal'd, And that's the reason why so few are heal'd Of their soul-wounds; but in our Hemisphere The Sun of Right'ousness is risen here For sin-distemp'red souls, with him he brings A healing Vertue, in his balmy wings. Sweet Jesu, to my smarting wounds apply The Balsom of thy Blood, or else I dye. Sanguis Christi salus Christiani. Ber. 9. On Bands. Try, sinners try to burst in twain Christ's bands, And cast his cords from your co-arcted hands; But know his bands will not be snapt in sunder, He can, I and he will, still keep you under: This mighty Prince, beyond the reach of man In Sion reigns, dethrone him if you can: Such as against the Lord their forces bend, Shall meet with dire confusion in the end. 10. On Banishment. Man for his fin from Paradise was sent Into the world, his life's a banishment; When the just soul is from the body freed, O that's a blessed banishment indeed! 11. On a Banner. Christ brings t'his Wine-cellar his Spouse, his Dove, The Banner he spreads over her, is Love. 12. On a Banckrupt. A sparing father, and a spending son, How they agree! what's by the father don, The Heir undoes; lightly come, lightly go, He must have horses, dogs, attendants too: No mar'le, for thrift and he are at a fray, And who can hold the thing that will away? He's in the field, when thrift is in the town, At last this gallant's whole estate's up blown: Better for having much t'have hate befall, Then to be pitied for spending all. Mali parta male dilabuntur, ill got ill spent: Quæ subito veniunt subito quandoque, recedunt, Quot cervos tot fures habemus. Plaut. Actæon-præda fuit canibus. Ovid, 13. On a Banquet. The King of Heav'n, his son, and spirit too, Invite t'a banquet, but how few do go: Let Nabal or Belshazar turn feast-maker, Lord! what a multitude will be partaker, But let such know, whose souls do feast on evils, They are in the mean while a feast for Devils. 14. On Baptism. We to the heav'nly Can'an cannot pass, Unless we first wade through the sea of glass; Regeneration's Lavour, is that sea, Wherein we all must wash, and cleansed be: A man God's Kingdom never can inherit, That is not born of Water and the Spirit: There's no approaching to Gods gracious throne Unwash'd; the glassie sea must be sail'd on. God's word's our compass, but the spirit driven The Pinnace of our souls, arrives at Heaven: In Baptism, we our selves engaged have To Christ, took our press-money; there, we gave Our names up to the Captain General Of our Salvation, to obey his call: There did we vow, and solemnly protest, Still to be true to his sweet interest; To fight it out under his Royal banner, Till death, and that in a couragious manner. Now if when call'd to suffer for his name. We should flinch back, O were it not a shame? Nay, Christ against us may our Baptism bring As an Indictment for this very thing: How shall we look on Christ another day, Who from our colours falsly fall away? O where alights, the curse, flying roul, But in the dwelling of the perjur'd soul, Zac. 5. 4. 15. On a Barber. The Barber shaves the hair, and clips the face. Nature deforms us, we are trimm'd by grace. 16. On Barrenness. Ah me! how naked are we! O how bare? Till with Christs right'ous robes we clothed are. 17. On a Bargain. Who contracts with the Devil, &amp; fells himself To him for worldly pleasures, honors, pelf That bargain yields bare gain, nay him undoes, For light chaff, he his precious soul forgoes. 18. On a Barge, or Bark. The world's a sea, we Barks by spirit-gales driven We sail, O whither are we bound? to Heaven. 19. On Barking. Ba'ls Priests are blind, they wander in the dark Dumb dogs they are, &amp; cannot therefore bark But if they should; Saints live above their spite, Dogs bark against the Moon, they cannot bite. 20. On Barley. Christ above four thousand fed, (Not with various dishes) With seven loaves of barley-bread, And a few small fishes: Strange! seven baskets were repleat, With the Offall, broken meat. 21. On a Barn. The S??. are wheat, the best, the noblest grain, Heav'n is the barn wherein this wheat is lain. 22. On a Bar. Christ is a Judge, before him at the Bar, The trembling sinner one day must appear. 23. On a Barrel. The woman of Sarepta could not fare ill, Whose meals was still encreased in her Barrel: Lord! when my stock of grace is well nigh spent, Give more, and I therewith will be content. 24. On Barrenness. To bear no fruit, was ever held a shame, Nay a curse too, O how are we to blame? On whom the largest showres of Gods word fall, That yet are barren, bear no fruit at all. 25. On a Barretter. The Barretter, who studies brawling Laws, Will set his tongue to sale in any Cause; Raw wounds he loves, and references hates, In tricks and querks, and quarrelsom debates He onely trades; his answers are evasions, His arguments are snarling cavillations: The work he brews in the Vacation long, He in the Term-time broacheth with his tongue; This greedy Horse-leech loves to suck and draw The putrid bloud of the corrupted Law; But of this wrangler soft, I must be mute, For fear against me he commence a suit. No more but this, such as delight in jarrs Should God destroy, wo be to Barreters. 26. On a Basis. The King's the Basis, people to sustain, The Kings prop is the Lord, by whom King Nay, if the Lord, who ruleth over all, Did not uphold the world, the world would fall reign: 27. On Bashfulness. Blushing is vertues tincture, comely grace Is oft pourtrayed by the bashful face: T'have cheeks distain'd with a vermiliion dy For sin, oh this is pious modestie. 28. On a Basilisk. Sin is a Basilisk, its poisnous breath, Is mortal, 'tis the Harbinger of death: Let's first discover it, and make it flie. Lest it should us pursue, and so we die, 29. On a Basket. Blessed shall be thy Basket and thy store, If Gods Law thou obey, and him adore; But curst thy basket, and thy store shall be, Who wilt not do as God commandeth thee. 30. On a Bason. When his disciples feet our Saviour scour'd, Water into a Bason first he pour'd: We are by nature Base ones, Lord pour in Thy grace, &amp; from our souls feet The Affections are the feet of our souls. wash off sin. 31. On a Bastard. This luckless issue, Heavens image coin'd With a forbidden stamp, but few do mind; And yet who is there, that delights not in That ugly monster, Satans bastard sin? Considred in his natural estate, Ev'ry man is an illegitimate: The unbelieving wretch, is one base-born, God looks upon him with contempt and scorn: He is a person vile, one of earths breed, A Brat engendred of the Serpents seed: Be sure, God will not father him therefore, But lay such Bastards at the Devils door. By faith it is, that God takes cognizance Of us for sons: 'tis faith doth us advance. By faith we are Gods children through Christ's merit, Faith gives us right and title to inherit. Til faith be wrought, we have no right to heav'n, Onely to lawful heirs that Land is given. Tis faith that doth legitimate, until Thou do believe, thou art a Bastard still. Boast not thy Pedigree, the devil can show As full as good a Coat of Arms as thou. 32. On a Bath. Tears are a Bath, My soul bathe thee therein, When Peter had defil'd himself with sin, He washd his soul with penetential tears, The water of Contrition heals and clears: The tears which impure Mary did impart. Not onely washd Christs feet, but cleans'd her heart. O sinners, make your eyes a flowing fount Of tears, weep for those sins you cannot count. Christs blood's a Bath, a fount set ope for sin And for uncleanness: Go, my soul, step in And bathe thee there, his Blood will scour so, That crimson sins shall seem as white as snow. O tis this Blood of Christ that lays the soul A whitening, these two bathes do make souls whole. 33. On a Battel. Away, fond fool, wilt thou prepare t'embatter With the great God, whose thundring judgments rattle About thine ears, when all the world records With one consent, the Battel is the Lords. Alas! alas! it is in vain to strive Against that God, whose wisdom can contrive, And power effect, thy certain overthrow, And hurl thee head-long into hellish woe. 34. On a Bay-tree. The wicked, spreading like a Bay-tree green, Dies in a trice, and can no more be seen: But mark the upright man, for that man's end Is peace, flourishing blessings him attend. 35. On a Beacon. We fire our Beacons when an en'mie's near, When sin invades us, how secure we are! The Beacon of mine heart, O Lord! enflame With grace, and Satan shall retreat with shame. 36. On a Beagle. The quick-nos'd Beagle, follows hard the chase, How slow are we in the pursuit of grace! 37. On a Beam. A beam is in our eye, we mind it not, But in our brother's can discern a more; To find out others failings, we are prone, But O 'twere well, did we amend our own. 38. On Beans. To him that brings his mind unto his means, O how delicious is a mess of Beans! He that hath in the bread of life a share, Can be contented with the meanest fare. 39. On a Beard. Methinks that hairy argument of Age, To sober actions should men engage; Its man prerogative: O what a grace Where vertue ruleth, is a well-thatch'd face! 40. On a Bear. I see an ill-shap'd Bear, and I begin To think, am I not more deform'd by sin? Lord, I by nature am austere and rough, But ah! thy grace can make me smooth enough. 41. On Beasts. The Forrest Burgesses by nature wild, Rav'nous &amp; fierce, Gods power makes more mild Gentle, and merciful to man, than men; Dan'el was safe when in the Lyons Den. In Dioclesians Reign, the Christians thrown To Leopards, Wolves, and Bears, were let alone. 42. On Beauty. Beauty! what is it but a Vernal Flow'r, Now fresh, alas! and wither'd in an hour Grace is the best complexion of the Soul, Compar'd to that, all other beauty's foul; It is ev'n at the first Plantation, Like Rachel, very fair to look upon. But still the more it lives, the more it sends Its rays of beauty forth; that which commends Christs lovely Spouse, is Soul-adorning grace, Not the external features of the Face. All glorious the Kings Daughter is within, She is fair, though she have a Black-Moors skin. Christs sparkling Robes of Right'ousness adorn The soul, these never can be thred-bare worn. Grace is the Holy Ghosts Embroidery; This roseate Beauty onely in Gods eye Sets off a Soul; such as in heart are pure He loves, but spir't'ual Lepers cann't endure. Unto his lesser Heav'n God doth repair, The Dove delighteth in the purest air. The Spir't, who in the likeness of a Dove Descended, fair-complexion'd souls doth love. This is Gods rest, here he for ever dwells, This beauty never fades, O this excells! It is the fairest heart, not fairest face Christ loves; the glory of a man is grace. Christ Bride she wears no Necklace on her neck The Graces are a Chain of Pearl that deck Her Lilly Soul; Grace is a precious thing To th'Soul, as is the Diamond to the Ring, The Sun to th'world; an heav'n enamel'd mind Is such a Beauty as is hard to find. Grace is a Flower of Delight, which Christ Loves to smel to; Grace makes us like the Highst: O what is there that may with Grace compare! There's nothing here below so rich, so rare. But O the Jewels which on Christ were hung, Cannot be blazon'd by a mortal tongue. Deformities immediately flow From sin, but blessed he, no sin did know. By th'Spirit conceiv'd, that is the reason then Why he was fairer than the sons of men. Mirror of Beauty in his looks divine, O what a graceful Majesty doth thine! Christ is described with an head of Gold, Ey-dazling gold, &amp; his Doves eves behold Cant; 11 His Spouse, his cheecks are as a bed of spices, His loveliness the Virgin-heart entices. What may be said, falls infinitely short Of his resplendent worth; who can report His rare unparagon'd perfections? man Can never do it, for no Angel can. In's person, disposition, suff'rings, graces, And conversation all men he surpasses. To God, to Saints, and to the Angel-quire, He's very lovely; what should we admire But his perfections? there is not a spot In him, his Beauty's seamless as his Coat. Beauty draws love; his beauty Christ imparts, O wear this Rose of Sharon in your hearts. Sinners, get Christ, in gaining him you get The richest Jewel in Heav'ns Cabinet. ??????? ???? ??? ?????? ??? ????? ???? Theo.'oret. ??? [illeg.] ???? ? ?????? Chrysest. 43. On a Bed. My body's earthly clothes which now I have, I shortly shall put off, and in the grave, My last bed, rest; but raised I shall be, And with these very eyes my Savior see. 44. On Bees. The Hony-merchants in the prime of May, By sun shine thro the fragrant meadows stray With Cypras wings, and by their Chymick skill, Extract the quintessence of Flow'rs, to fill Their hollow-vaulted cells: what heavy loads Their laden thighs transport to their aboads? When others pine with want, in winters cold, They live upon their self-made liquid Gold. So in prosper'ties summer, should we lay Up store of grace, against a winters day. 45. On a Beggar. Oh! in my bones such a disease doth lurk, A knavish beggar cry'd, I cannot work: And afterwards confest it was the Lazies; We work not for our souls, such our disease is. Lord, we deserve thy whip, need no curb Bridles, Who are by nature troubled with the idles. Beggars we are, whose hourly wants implore Each Meals relief; we beg at Heavens door, Give us this day our daily bread; we crave, God gives it us, we can but ask and have. Who live upon Gods alms, must not refuse His reffuse; beggars must not pick and chuse. That news of Beadles, and their tort'ring whips Is not the language of Gods angry lips, Is a rich mercy: Beggars should be humble, Thou art a Beggar, ah! why dost thou grumble And murmure at thy God! wilt thou repine That art sustain'd by Providence Divine? If the Alms-basket of Gods Providence We slight, how justly may he say, go hence: Go hence, proud beggars, with your cursed state And come no more for Alms at Heaven-gate. I am a Beggar, Lord, let me partake Of grace and glory, for Christ Jesus sake. 46. On Beginnings. Sin its first rise, as ev'l must be withstood, Grace its first rise, embrac'd as being good. Where is no grace to crush sin in the shell, Sin grows, and it will hurry men to hell. Perpetuated woes are Vices dregs, Lets crush betimes these Cockatrices Eggs. 47. On Being with Christ. To be with Christ in Glory, doth include A Priviledge of the first Magnitude; Saint Paul long'd to d'epart, that he might rest On that soft pillow, his dear Saviors brest, As the belov'd Disciple John, once did, While in the flesh, our life of grace is hid Under Corruptions veil, until we be With Christ, our grace is in its infancie. O when we sit with Christ, and wear crown, Our graces shall be fully ripe, and blown, Which here are in the buds; here we inherit The first-fruits, there the full crop of the Spirit. Death is sweet to the Saints, to heav'n they come By crossing of this Mare-Martinium: Here we behold Christ darkly, through a glass; There shall his veil be taken off his face, And he in his Embroidery appear; Heav'n were not Heav'n, if Christ were not there. Christ with his graces, here his Spouse doth honor In heav'n, his glory he will put upon her. She shall shine by his beams, sit next his throne, By vertue of her Marri'ge Union. Here she's in sable for her absent Love; But Christ in heav'n her mourning will remove, And clothe her in white robes; Christ he prepares An Handkerchief to dry up all her Tears. O there the heart, and all the senses shall Be fill'd with joy at once, none thence can fall. In heav'n we ever with the Lord shall rest, The Saint, when there, hath his Quietus est. 48. On Believing in Christ. And shall the Saints for ever be possest Of heav'nly thrones? with Christ in glory rest! Oh then, lets try our selves whether or no We are such persons, as to Christ shall go At deaths arrest? from hence we must be gone But shall we go to Christ? this may be known As thus; if here the life of grace we live In Christ, Christ us will when we die, receive: How blest is union! union is the ground Of priviledge; in Christ we must be found Clad in his robes of Holiness, before we Can be with Christ dress'd in his robes of glory O labour to get faith; faith is the grace Unites to Christ; faith moves Christ to embrace Us in his loving arms; by faith alone Christ as an husband, as a Lord we own. Faith gives the interest, tis faith doth bring Christ home unto the soul; Christ is the ring, Faith's finger puts it on; faith opens wide The orifice, in her sweet Saviors side, And drinks his blood; faith justifies, make clear O get faith, of all graces Faith is Queen: Faith paves a Cawsie to a heav'nly throne, Believers die Heirs to the glorious crown: O Lord enrich me with that saving grace, That I amongst thy Saints may have a place. 49. On a Bell. The Gospel is a Silver-warning Bell, To ring men in to Christ, and yet to Hell How many go? its sound we cannot hear, Unless God, Spirit ring it in our ear. 50. On Bellows. My zeal is but a spark; Lord! I desire Thy Spirits Bellows to blow up my fire, That I may to the glory of thy Name Ascend still to thee, in an holy flame. 51. On the Belly. The Belly's Natures Kitchin, is't not odd A House of Office, should become a God? Many do serve their Bellies, oh how few Yield God that honor which to him is due! 52. On Beloved. God hath made us, whom sin had once undon, Beloved, in his Well-beloved Son. 53. On a Belt. Falshood surcingle most; how few are there About their loins, Truths golden girdle wear! That man must needs be strenuous and stout, That with the Belt of Truth is girt about. 54. On a Bench. The worlds a Bench, whereon a while we stay, Till we to Heav'nly thrones are call'd away. 55. On a Benefice. Men now adays fat Benefices get, And straightway lay aside the Preachers net. So I win souls to God, I do not care How small my Profits, and my In-comes are. 56. On Benefits. As benefits bestow'd, bind the receiver; So hearty thanks return'd, oblige the giver, Christ cleans'd the Leper, and we read but one Often, that gave God thanks for what was done. 57. On the Best. God, that on us dost the best things bestow, To thee the best of what we have, we owe; Thou showr'st on us the riches of thy grace, We fling sins filthy ordure in thy face, For Gold give dirt, and is not this a shame How blind our sacrifice are, how lame! He that delights in God, bestowes on him The strength of his affections; the cream Of his performances; to God he brings The very best he hath, for offerings; The firstlings of the flock, and of the fat Thereof, nor grumbles in the least thereat. God who is best, will with the best be serv'd; Domitian would have his Statue carv'd In burnish'd Gold, and not in Brass, or Wood, God who is good himself, craves what is good; The best of our best things, he best approves, Our golden servicies he dearly loves. Hypocrites duties do procure Gods loathing, They offer to him that which cost them nothing: They care not what before the Lord they bring, A lazy pray'r, or such like sorry thing: A cheap Religion always likes them best; A costly one they very much detest: A broken heart is my best sacrifice, O Lord, I trust thou wilt not it despise: O grant that I may labour to do first My best, and then let Satan do his worst. 58. On a Beetle. How beetle-blind are we ! how void of sight, Ev'n in the midst of glorious-Gospel light. O mentem Cimmeriis tenebris atrociorem. Lactan. 59. On Betraying. Judas his Master with a Kiss betrays, How many Judasses are now adays! 60. On Betrothing. O let's admire Christ's love in us betrothing, Ev'n while we were the objects of his lothing. 61. On a Bever-beast. Men for the skin pursue the Beaver-beast, Satan from hunting souls, doth never rest. 62. On Bewitching. The world's a witch, with honour, pleasures, riches, The spells she casts, she multitudes bewitches. 63. On the Bible. The sacred Testament both new and old, Are the two Lips, by which God doth unfold For our souls health, the counsels of his brest; And therefore of all books, the Bible's best. 64. On Bigamy. Christ's constant to his Spouse, the Church our Mother, Nor will he ever marry any other. 65. On a Bile. Sin is an angery bile, which few do feel, And nothing but the bloud of Christ can heal. 66. On a Bill. The bill chops wood, cuts off excresences, So must repentance our iniquities. 67. On a Bill. Satan against the Saints, prefers his bill, But Christ the right'ous Judge acquit them will. 68. On Birds. The feather'd people of the air agree To carol forth Gods praise, and shall not we? 69. On the New-Birth. Twice born! how can this be? by flesh &amp; blood This mystery cannot be understood: By faith it may, without Regeneration, Of water and the Spir't, there's no Salvation. 70. On a Bishop. The Scripture sayes, a Bishop must be blamless, Chaste, sober, holy, (not profane, &amp; shameless) Not close, but free; to godly men propitious, Apt for to teach, (not piteful and malicious. Such men were Titus, Timothy, and Paul, And our late Jewels, Davenant, Usher, Hall. Such are, (and O may they be long enjoy'd) Laborious Reynolds, charitable Floyd: To mild Nicholson, some wish the turn'd-out tribe That can (they say) to Gods command subscribe: Might be unchain'd, have freedom to dispense The Gospel, though they miss'd preheminence, Love best perswades, the learned have exprest, And wise men find, the Golden mean is best. 71. On a Bit, or Morsel. 'Tis by free grace, we are sustain'd and fed, Alas! we ne're deserv'd one bit of bread. 72. On Bitterness. Sin makes fair promises, but nothing less Performs, it always ends in bitterness. 73. On a Bit, or Snaffie. Lord! when my tongue would gallop into sin, Thy Presence is the bit must keep it in. 74. On a Blab, or Long-tongue. 'Twas Davids pray'r; Lord, set a watch before My mouth, &amp; of my lips keep thou the door, He that gives too much freedom to his tongue, Offends his God, and doth his neighbour wrong. 75. On Blackness. There's none, but is originally soil'd With inbre'd filth, and actually spoil'd, We are born Moors, and by continual sin, This swarthiness hath much increased been: We have no virtual nitre of our own To whiten us, the bloud of Gods dear son Can only cleanse, and purifie the soul And make us fair, who are by nature soul. 76. On a Bladder. Pride puffeth up the heart, but death's design'd To prick this bladder, and let out the wind. 77. On Blame. For crucifying Christ their Lord, we blame The Jewes, yet daily do the very same; Our sins are ranckling thorns, the nails, the spear That fear our Lord, and we shed not a tear. 78. On Blasphemy. Blasphemy is a bullet, that rebounds From God at whom 'tis shot, &amp; the blaspheme wounds. 79. On Blessedness. That in reversion, there's a blessedness The Saints believe; and Scripture doth express, Blessedness is the souls perfection, Of Christ'an industry tis the whet-stone, The Saints highest ambition, tis the flower Of his delight, the end which evermore All men desire; this is the white all aim To hit, this is the center; this is the flame That nourisheth our zeal; this precious Gem, Hangs not upon an earthly Diadem: It lies not in the acquisition, Of things beneath the circle of the Sun. It cannot be by any chymick skill Extracted here, emptiness cannot fill: For birth, for wealth for worldly joys, for wit, None might compare with Solomon, and yet He tells us in the hight of contemplation, That all is vanity and soul-vexation. Alas! the sacred Tree of blessedness, Doth not grow in an earthly Paradise: For sin hath not, God curst the loathed ground, How then therein, can blessedness be found And yet there's many digging for it here, As if a curse could any blessing bear. Fire may as easily from water-springs Be drawn, as blessedness from earthly things: The world's below the soul, it's foot-stool tis, And therefore cannot crown it with true bliss. Worldly accommodations cannot still The troubled heart, nor with true comfort fill: Riches can never satisfie the soul, Because not real, and away they roul, Like a swift stream; therefore they never can, With endless happiness, enrich a man; Riches are thorns, they vex the head with care Of getting, so they wound the heart with fear Of loosing them, a man may be possest Of golden Mountains, and be never blest: The sole enoyment of these things below, Will bring a curse; cannot therefore bestow Happiness on us, Gold (tis sad to tell) Hath sunk the souls of many men to Hell: Judas for money his salvation sold, The Pharises bought with refined mould Their own damnation: creatures comforts can Derive no true felicity to man: 'Tis in an higher Region, they that do Seek for it here, do to the wrong box go: Blessedness is too delicate a Plant To dwell in natures soil, he knows no want That hath it; O how blest is his condition, That hath a fall and sensible fruition Of God the supream good; there's nothing can But God enjoy'd, beatifie a man. God is the chiefest good, he makes them blest Who in him only, acquiesce and rest: Blessedness is the alone Diamond, In God the Rock of ages to be found. He is the top of all felicity, The center in whom all the lines agree: The soul is not compleatly happy, till It meet in God, who only can it fill In blessedness, or else it is not right, Are these Ingred'ents, spirits of delight; So meliority, and sweet variety, Compleat perfection, and a full satiety: Eternities the highest link of bliss, Its sun-shine never sets, nor clouded is, God only can true blessedness afford, Blest are the people whose God is the Lord. Sinner lament thy sins, false ways decline, And sweat hard till thou finde this golden mine; Tis seizable, the flaming Sword of sin, Can only keep thee back from entring in Th'heavenly Paradise: Get an interest In Christ, walk uprightly, and thou art blest: That thou art bound for heav'n, do thou not say Who steer'st thy course the quite contrary way, But thou that art a Saint free grace adore That, that must set thee on the blissful shore; I must pass through the gate of grace, before I Can enter into the White-Hall of Glory. 80. On blessings. All blessings are from God, his golden bouls Of mercies still refresh our bodies, souls; His blessings ever over-flow the banks Of our desires, and shall we ebb in thanks? God will, if we be thankful for the store Of blessings he allows, allow us more. 81. On Blindness. 'Tis day, and yet we grope the way to finde, Strange that the Gospels light should make us blinde. The world's God blindes mens eyes, they neither can See their Disease, nor their Physician. Bodicea in her own conceit Was rich, and yet how poor was her estate! The blind man in the Gospel till Christ came, Recov'red not his sight, and in Christ's name Implore we must, the spirit to inlight Our spir't'al eyes, for we have lost our sight. 82. On Blockishness. Before the fall our understandings light Was clear, but since how darkned is our sight How blockish are we! how unapt to learn The things; that do immediately concern Our everlasting peace! O Lord restore To us thine Image, by us lost before: Be pleas'd to open our sin-sealed eyes That we may know thee, and thy goodness prize. 83. On a Blossom. Grace is the bud that sprouts on Par'dise tree The blossome is glorious Eternitie: Unless we bud in grace, we shall not bloom In glory, none but Saints in Heaven find room. 84. On Bloud. The bloud that guish'd from murd'red A[illeg.] wound Empierc'd the heav'ns, with its revenged sound, But ah! the bloud of my dear, Lord was spilt, To cleanse my bloud-bedabled soul from guilt It cries for pardon, scours out all my stains, Procures my freedom from eternal pains. How precious is the Balm of Gilead! By it salvation can be only had. Christ, he will have the honour of the cure, Or he will never heal us to be sure: The oyl in Rhemes (tis stori'd never wasts, Though always us'd, Christ's bloud for ever lasts, Bubbling from his pierc'd side: O make recourse My soul still to this Fountain; O divorce Thy self from sin, (sin is the thing confounds,) Take Sanctuary in his sanguine wounds: This is the sacred Bath open'd for sin, And for uncleanness, go my soul step in And bathe thee there, this is that spir'tal spring That makes clean hearts; Christ's bloud's a precious thing; If to the heart applied, it makes it flourish In holiness, nothing like this doth nourish The fainting soul no desperate condition There is with Christ, who is the best Physitian: His bloud hath sov'raign vertue to restore, All wounds, he hath a Salve for ev'ry sore. Agnus Christus sauus Christian. Bern. Occatus viribus egregius sons. Juven. 85. On Blowes. We did commit the fault, but justice dealt The blows to Christ; the dol'rous stripes he felt, That so we might be heal'd, to him was carv'd The punishment, that sinful we deserv'd. 86. On Boasting. Tell me fond man, whereof hast thou to boast, Whose days are ev'l at best, but few at most; Earths best delights are checked-with'r with sorrow, And dost thou brag of what shall be to morrow! But if thou must be proud, make this thy Pride, To know Christ Jesus, and him Crucifi'd. 87. On the Body. How brittle is this fleshy Cabbinet, Wherein the richest Diamond is set! But time will come, when this vile mortal case, Shall glorious Immortality imbrace. The body is, while here infirm and weak Our earthen ware, a little thing will break Trajan's ashes after his death, to Rome Were brought, and honor'd: at the day of doom So shall the precious ashes of the Just, Be much esteem'd, and shine as Silver dust. Christ risen is, and he's the bodies head, Therefore the body shall not still lie dead: Saints bodies rais'd from out their slumbring grave Neither diseases, nor defects shall have; The body here's a clog, a lumpish thing, In heaven it shall have a nimble wing. Here muddy, vile, passive, and transitory, In heav'n transparent, beautifi'd with glory Impassible, grown to a perfect stature, Free from the wants, and woes, &amp; wrongs of nature Immortal Heaven is an healthful Air, There is no sadness, nor no dying there. When the Saints soul shall with the body meet, How blest will be their greeting! O how sweet! 88. On a Body of Death. Sin is a body, for it weighs us down, In prayer it hinders our Ascension; We with corruption over-power'd shall be, Till death pull off these weights and set us free. Sin is deaths body, it is Carrion smell Annoys the gracious soul, which loaths t'dwell In Meseck, and sojourn in the Tents Of Kedar, whence arise unsav'ry scents O wo is me, that I am forc'd to stay With sin! how long the pious soul doth say, Shall I be vex'd with inmates, O my God, With thee I long to settle mine abode. 89. On Boldness. God holds his scepter forth, &amp; ev'ry one May come with boldness to his gracious throne The child with confidence makes known his wants To his dear father, and his father grants What he desires, and shall not God much rather, Who has the disposition of a father As well as the relation, supply His Childrens wants, when they unto him cry. How should we to this tender father run In all conditions, when by sin undone; O say to God, Father, my heart, my heart, O quicken, soften it; does Satan dart Temptations at us? God relieves his Saints, Who in his bosom pour forth their complaints. 90. On a Bolt. A fools bolt is soon shot, the Proverb says. Scripture Fools, wicked men: ah now adays Do make a Bolt of their licentious tongue, To blaspheme God, &amp; do their neighbor wrong. 91. On a Bond. Christ dy'd the Saints may well be over-joy'd. For now Wraths bond and obligation's void. 92. On Bondage. Embondaged for ever we had been, But that our blessed Savior stood between God and our souls, redeem'd us with his blood. Which streamed from him like a crimson flood. Sin, death, &amp; hell, Christ by his death trod under And snapt those bonds (that held us fast) in sunder 93. On a Bonfire. The flick'ring flames of sprightly fire, Unto the highest Arch aspire. Mount up my soul, to God above, On winged flames of holy love. 94. On Books. Experience tells, vain Books, and idle Plays, And such as Ovids Amatorious Lays, How well they sell! whilst better Tractates lye Untouch'd, Religious Books but few will buy. Sad times! for one that in Gods Bible looks, There's ten that pore on Cards, the devils books. All want on books, could some have their desire, Would be condemn'd to an Ephesian fire; And though it would the Devil much displease, Yet might one say, as Alcibiades, Of the Athenian heaps of burning scrowls, I ne're saw clearer fire, nor purer coals. Nunquam vide ignem clariorem. 95. On Borrowing. Our lives, and what we have, of God we borrow, Who may recal them in before to morrow: Let me not grumble, Lord, but be content To pay what thou demand'st what thou hast lent 96. On Bosoms. Meek Moses bosom is the Law Divine; The golden gospel wherein grace doth shine Christs bosom is, and as in sacred Story It is recorded, Abraham's his glory. 97. On a Bottle. When all the liquor in our bottle's spent, So long as there's a Well, lets be content. 98. On a Bowl. Wealth, honor, pleasures, to and fro do roul; Nor is't a wonder, for the Worlds a Bowl. 99. On Bounds. God who is boundless in himself surrounds, The raging waters with appointed bounds, Also the days of man, that then he can Not pass, alas! our life is but a span. 100. On Bounty. All's lost that is laid out, but what is giv'n to Christ &amp; his poor members (heirs of heaven Though pilgrims here) is lost like scattred grain, And at joys harvest, shall be found again: The end of life is service; to extend Good things to such, as want is the great end Of our creation; let us not be found Unprofitable burthens to the ground. Almes is a sacrifice gratulatory, Pleasing to God, and its reward is Glory. Estates are Talents lent to trade withal, We are but stewards; God may quickly call For our accounts, of what we have disburst, The tree that bare no fruit our Savior curst. 101. On a Bow. God like our enemy hath bent his Bow, And threats a universal overthrow: To the ungodly world, withal our hearts, Lets turn to him before he thrills his darts. 101. On a Bower. The whole world is an heavenly earthly bow'r, Hev'n is its sieling, and the Earth its floor, But ah! our Bower, this heav'n, this earth, must pass Away, as well as we, who are as grass. 103. On a Box. Mans body is a box till death it split The Soul, that precious Gem is kept in it. 104. On Boyes. The world is in our eye like sportive boyes, We trade for trifles, and are all for toyes. 105. On Bracelets. Abrahams servant put loves Golden Bands, A brace of Bracelets on Rebekah's hands; But O how gloriously will Christ adorn His spouse! what bracelets shall by her be worn! 106. On a Brand. God plucked us as brands from out hel fire, Who neither could deserve, nor yet desire This at his hands My soul, free-grace admire! 107. On Bran. How sieve-like is the Memory of man, 'Tis too retentive of the grosser bran; All sinful trash, and rubbish, but alas: It lets Gods word, the purer flour, through pass. 108. On Brass. A man for Eloquent may pass, But wanting Charity, alas! He is as tinkling sounding Brass. 109. On Brawling. For Bawling Curs and salvage Bears, To fall together by the ears Is common; 'tis a horrid shame, For such to brawl that bear Christ's Name. If we have wrangled heretofore, Now let's be Friends, and sin no more. 110. On Bread. Bread is life's staff, and yet we cannot stand By it, unless God hold it with his hand. God's blessing is the only stay and prop Of that staff Bread, without it down we drop. Our feeder is our food, not on his grounds, This Shepherd feeds his sheep, but with his wounds Christ is the living, &amp; life-giving bread, That soul that feeds on him, shall never need. 111. On the Breast. With the humble Publican May I smite upon my breast, And sigh out this fair request, Pardon Lord me sinful man. 112. On Breath. The breath that in our Nostrils is, Is the Anointed of the Lord; And what he freely doth afford, He may recal when ere he please. Lord when I breath my last, grant I May reign with thee Eternally. 113. On Breeches. Breeches which in the room of fig-leaves came Are but the badges of our guilt and shame, And this (methinks) should serve to humble all That wear them, since they minde us of our fall. 114. On Brethren. All they that Christianity embrace, Are Brethren by Creation or Race; Are Brethren by Prosession or Place, And by Regeneration or Grace. Behold how good, how pleasing 'tis to see, Brethren by Race, Place, Grace, in one t'agree. 115. On Brevity. I came, I saw, and then I overcame Victorious Cæsar, said King Philp wrote Threats to th'Laconian Lords, but to the same They only answer'd if—(as stories Note) Lord come and see, and conquer us: Let man, If thou be for us, hurt us if—(he can) 116. On Briars. Sins are entangling briars, which are found Within mans heart, that barren piece of ground. These wound the soul the gracious soul desires Nothing more, then to get out of these Briars. 117. On Bribes. Bribes are attractive, 'tis a bribe that draws On Friendship sooner then a right'ous cause; Witness Gehazi, Judas, Samuel's sons, But ah! the bribed into ruine runs: Though the bag be drawn with a double cord Of silk and silver, favour and reward. He that receives against the innocent, Injurious bribes, unless he do repent Of that soul crime, shall find another day, That vengeance is the Lords, and he'l repay. 118. On a Bridegroom. Christ is the Bridegroom, and the Church his Bride, Whose hearts with loves eternal bands are ti'd, He found her foul, but he hath wash'd her so, That now she's whiter than the driven snow. 119. On a Bridge. Death draws the bridge of life, sends in a trice Sinners to Hell, but Saints to Paradise. 120. On Bride-well. To work in Bride-well is an easie toil To their's who must in broad hel always broil. 121. On a Bridle. Think often on the all-discerning eye Of the great God, who always doth descry Thy secret thoughts from perpetraing sin, No better bridle for to keep thee in. 122. On Brightness. The blessed Saints though here obscure they be To the World's eye, yet shall hereafter see God face to face, and gloriously bright; Out-shine the sparkling Jewls of the night. 123. On Brimstone. Here blue flam'd brimstone much offends the smell, Oh how doth it torment the damn'd in Hell. 124. On Brine. Pray'rs that are pickel'd with the brine of tears, God barrels up in his attentive ears. 125. On a Brink. Alas! we dance upon destructions brink, And each sin is a weight to make us sink. 126. On a Broad-way. No wonder many love so well the road That leads to ruin, tis because its broad. 127. On a Brood. The brood is safe hous'd underneath the wings Of the indulgent damm, our safety springs From God whose wings shall ever over-spread His Saints, and never any feathers shed. 128. On a Brook. The bubling brook that wantons up and down The flowry enameld Meads, and trips upon The murmering pebbels, slips into the main, And still payes tribute to the watry Plain: Ev'n so to God who first to us conveys, His love, should we return the streams of praise. 129. On a Broom. How necessary is the Houswifes broom, To sweep out dust that genders in the room! But oh! the besome of Jehovahs ire Sweeps dusty souls, into infernal fire. 130. On Broth. Esau for a mess of broth Sold his Birth-right; we are loth To exchange things transitory, For immortal boundless glory. 131. On the Brow. Lord! I have sinn'd, that is the reason thou Lookest on me with so severe a brow; Behold me in the face of thy dear Son, O then I know thou wilt no longer frown. 132. On a Brush. We brush our dusty cloaths, sin soils the soul, Yet how content are we to keep that foul. 133. On a Brute. The Oxe will know his owner, and the Ass Her master's crib, but Israel (alas!) Will not know me, says God, they have destroy'd Themselves, and made their understanding void. Till God open our lips, our mouths are dumb, And we more brutish then a Brute become. 134. On a Bubble. How vain a thing is man; his life's a bubble, Replenish'd with winds of care &amp; trouble. 135. On a Buck. We run from God, and are by nature wild A Bucks, grace cicurates, &amp; makes us mild, O God, to me be pleased to impart Thy grace, O that can tame my wanton heart. 136. On a Bucket. We have a well, let's let our bucket down, To fetch up waters of Salvation. 137. On a Buckler. God is a guarding buckler to the just, Who in his sure defence repose their trust. 138. On a Bud. Lord nip the bud, before the bloom begins, For ah! I would not flourish in my sins. 139. On a Bug, or Hob-gobling. Our wayward children, we with bugbears fear, T'were well if terrifi'd from sin we were. 140. On a Building. The Royal Palace where the Saints shall dwell, A building is, not made with mortal hands; How doth it in Maginificence excell! Above the starry Firmament it stands; 'Tis spacious, precious, specious, and pure, And shall to all eternity endure. 141. On a Bullet. Gods thund'ring judgments like the bullet run, Shot from the bowels of the murd'ring Gun. 142. On a Bul-rush. Hang down our head? we like a bul-rush may, Yet not be truly humbled when we pray. 143. On a Bul-wark. God to his people is a bulwark strong, So that Hell-gates shal never do them wrong. 144. On Bundles. The Tares that growing with the Wheat is found, Shal for hell fire be in bundles bound. 145. On a Burgess. Each Saint (chosen by God himself) is sent To set, as Burgess, in Heav'ns Parli'ment: And with those noble Peers the Angels sing Immortal praise, to their triumphant King. 146. On Burials. Nature, kind to her own, did first devise T'entomb a Corps with solemn obsequies; And surely grace allows a Burial, To th'Holy Ghost his Temples, when they fall. 147. On Burning. Come see my zeal for God, Jehu pretends; An holy zeal, but he had base-by-ends: Lord kindle in my heart, a burning flame Of real zeal to glorifie thy name. 148. On Burrs. Sinners to one another stick like burrs; O why should Saints fall out, like wrangling currs! 149. On Burthens. Come unto me, I hear my Savior say To ev'ry sin-press'd soul, O come away All ye that grone under sins massie weight, And I will ease you, and refresh you streight: My yoke is easie, and may well be worn, My burden's not too heavy to be borne: Yield, yield my soul, his are no Tyrant Laws, His spir't will help thee; If the Loadstone draws The Ir'n, the Iron easily may move, So thou—Out of a principle of love Obey thy Savior serve him with delight; Love makes sin heavy, and Christs burden light. God never burdens us, but that he may Un-burthen us of sin, there's in the way Of duty, joy, and Heaven at the end, O think of the reward that doth attend Your service, and bless God you are not under The curses of the Law, the Law rores thunder. 150. On a Bush. The burning bush was unconsum'd with fire, For God was in't, O let's his pow'r admire; The fire of persecution, cannot tame Christs Church, for he is with her in the flame. 151. On a Bushel. Those graces which the Saints as lights conceal, Under a bushel, tryals oft reveal. 152. On a Busie-body. Ardelio, so much abroad doth roam, Its hard for him to finde himself at home. 153. On Business. The business that we are set about While we are in this world, is to work out Our own salvation with trembling fear. But O how few make this their chiefest care! O Lord, enable me to work, that I, May have grace wages glory when I dy. 154. On a Butter-fly. We smile to see our little Children try Their skill, to catch the painted butter-flie. And yet alas, we do the very same, Nay worse our selves, O is not this a shame! 155. On But. Bad is the But mars all, some but for some Pleasures or Profit, unto Christ would come; But for his wife, with whom he must go dwell, But for the bidding of his friends farewel; But for th'interring of his father dear, But for his viewing of his field bought there. But for the trial of his Oxon, he Would follow Christ, ah Lord! such Buts have we, 'Tis blessed when our Buts are for the best, Ye were as bad as any of the rest; But ye are wash'd, but ye are cleansed now, How sweet is the wine, from such good butts does flow! 156. On a But. Gods glory is the but, but Christians hark, Grace is the only Arrow hits that mark. 157. On a Butcher. The Butcher lives by killing, we by dying To sin, and our corruptions mortifying. 158. On a Butler. The Butler keeps provision, O hoord Up in thy heart the food of life, Gods word. 159. On Buttery. The Butt'ry is a necessary place, O blessed heart that is well stor'd with grace. 160. On Buying. He buys, and sels, and liveth by the loss, The Proverb says, when worldly things go cross With any; but if they that buy and sell Would speak the truth, doubtless things would go well. 161. On a By-way. Sin is a by-way, easie to be found, By all that are for hells dark Kingdom bound; For want of light, and a good guide to lead Them right, so many in sins by-path tread. The words a light, Lord let thy spirit be My guide, that I thy glorious face may see. I must walk in the narrow way, before that I Can finde true rest, grace leads us into glory. C 1. On a Cabinet. The heart is Gods peculiar Cabinet, And Satan knows not what is in it set, Heav'ns a rich Cabinet, where God reconds Glorifi'd Sts. those sparkling Diamonds. 2. On a Cable. Great God! to come to thee we are unable, O draw us with thy love; thy love's a Cable. 3. On a Cage. The gracious soul desires to be dismist From out the bodies cage, to be with Christ. 4. On a Caitiffe. O Lord, I have contrair'd thy just command, Lo! I as a convicted Caitiffe stand, Trembling before thee; guilty Lord I cry, Yet plead for mercy, since thy Son did dye. 5. On a Cake. Great God! well may a cake upon the coals, Suffice our bodies, so thou feast our souls. 6. On Calamity. Men grieve when they calamity are in, But oh who is there lays to heart his sin! 7. On a Calender. Vertue alas! is look'd upon of late, But as a Calender grown out of date. 8. On Calends. O may I yield at the Greek Calends (never) To Satan's laws, but serve the Lord for ever. 9. On Calis. The Dev'l says come to me, but I'le undoe thee; The world says follow me, but I will slight thee; The flesh says follow me, but I'le forgo thee, But Christ says follow me, and I'le delight thee: Run, run my soul, thy Savi'ors call is best, He ? is the Way, Truth, Life, shun, shun the rest. 10. On the Calves of the lips. If of our lips, we offer up the calves, And not our hearts, we serve the Lord the halves. 11. On a Calme. God that allays high winds, &amp; stills rough seas, Can calm the consc'ence, give the troubled ease 12. On a Caltraps. Christians march towards heaven, to cause their stay, The spiteful world hurls caltraps in their way 13. On a Camel. The crowching camel, shall as soon go through An Eagles eye, as Misers to Heav'n goe. 14. On a Camp. Most darkness love, &amp; late the Gospel's Lamp No mar'le, for they belong to Satan's camp. 15. On a Candle. Men place a candle having tin'd the wick, Not und'r a bed, but in a candle-stick, For common benefit, so God prefers His Ministers, to be his Houshold Stars. 16. On a Cane, or Reed. Man like a Reed, still shaken with the wind, Till fixed on his God, no rest can find. 17. On a Canker. Sin is a canker, it infests the soul, Christ kills it by his death, and make us whole. 18. On a Cann. In Bacchus Courts, he is the only man That smoaks Tobacco, &amp; can soak the Cann. 19. On a Cannon. O how uneven are our lives, O Lord; Reduced to the Canon of thy word! 20. On a Cannon. The thunder-mocking Cannon vomits fire, But ah! how dreadful is th'Eternal ire. 21. On a Cap. The cap relieves the head, and keeps it warm; The heart preserv'd by grace; can catch no harm. 22. On a Captain. Christ is our Captain, if we stand our ground He will all our soul-enemies confound, His death's, our life; his power alone can quell Sin and the world, nay all the Devils in hell. 23. On Captivity. By Satan, we for evermore had been Led captive, and embondaged to sin; Had not our Savior cancelled the scrouls Of angry Justice, and redeem'd our souls. 24. On a Carbonade. The Reprobates their bodies, and their souls, Must broil in hell, on everlasting coals. 25. On a Carbuncle. Sin is a carbuncle, it evermore Shines bright, yet is a dangerous Plague-sore. 26. On a Carkass. The soul-less carkass, none take pleasure in, And can God think we love souls dead in sin? 27. On Cards. The pleasures of the world, are Satan's cards, Who in them most delights, he most regards. 28. On a Cardinal. The chiefest Cardinal the Roman pack, Cannot preserve a Cardinal from wrack. 29. On Care. A prudent and religious care is good, A soul-dividing care must be withstood: We are charg'd to commit our way unto The Lord, not undertake his work to do, Which is to take care, as it's ours to cast; Care is a spir't'al canker that doth waste The spir'ts, when 'tis excentrick; we in brief May sooner add a furlong to our grief By our distrustful care, than to our joy A cubit. Care excessive will destroy, As it dishonours much the King of Kings, So it takes off the heart from better things: And while we thinking are how we shall do To live; to die we not remember how. Lord! what tumult'ous swarms of buzzing Cares Hive in man's Head! how silver'd are his Hairs Before the time! how Care distracts the Mind! It breaks the sleep, by it the Body's pin'd, The Soul is wrack'd. 'Twas Adams, want of care Made us become so careful as we are. The Curse bred Care, Lord may I always cast My care on thee, who cared for me hast, And wilt do still; 'tis wisdom to unload And cast the burthen of our care on God. To a Believers care Death puts an end; Death comes to a Believer as a friend, And says, do not distract, nor thus disquiet Thy Mind about thy clothing and thy diet. In gath'ring wealth, let not thy Head and Heart Be prick'd with care, I will but thrill my Dart Once at thee, and thou shalt be dispossest Of all those cares that thus torment thy Brest. My Soul care to please God, but oh! beware Of Heart-dividing, God-distrusting care. 30. On Carelesness. When Adam grew careless of Gods command And left off Innocencies robes, he caught The Falling-sickness, could no longer stand Upright, his carelesness (alas!) hath brought The Universe which was (before his fall) A Paradise into an Hospital. 31. On Carnal Security. Of all Diseases in a Common-weal, Carnal Security is worst to heal; None are so dangerously sick as they Who feel not their Disease (Physitians say) Laodicea's sick, but thinks she's well; Thousands that hope for Heav'n, drop down to Hell When blinded with security men cry, Peace, peace, sudden destruction is nigh. Quid miserius misero non miserante seipsum. Au g. 32. On Carriage. As children of the High'st, we should behave Our selves, and be obedient, humble, grave, Industrious, heroical, and holy, Cheerful, not given to pensive Melancholy; Longing to be at home: the Saints do still Readily out of love obey Gods Will: Lowly they are, it never was allow'd To any of Gods children to be proud. Left for a while, fall into Sin they do, That learn they may on lower ground to go, And that their Plumes may fall. Saints sober are In their Opinions, Speeches, and Attire. Diligence in their Calling they express, God never seals Warrants to Idleness. The Sts. are high-born of the true blood Royal, And scorn to act the thing that is disloyal, To stain their noble Birth, they are upright, And in Gods holy ways take great delight; For though in a strange country now they be, Yet they the New Jerusalem shall see; Death will convey them thither, that shall come Safe to their fathers house, their long'd for home. 33. On Carking. We may not cark, and care excessively; For worldly things, these perish, we must die. 34. On Carrying. In this life a Believer, by the Saints Is carri'd, him their prayers wings advance, And when he is of this frail life bereaven, The blessed Angels carry him to Heaven. 35. On Carols. The carols which the Heralds of the spring Chant forth, are dull to what the Saints shall sing Eternally to their melliffluous King. 36. On a Carpenter. Afflictions as a Carpenter oft squares, And for Gods spir't'al building us prepares. 37. On a Carper. Momus doth always carp at other crimes, He might do wel to view his own somtimes. 38. On a Cart. Christ as a Cart with sheavs of full-ear'd corn, Was press'd, by him were our offences born. 39. On a Carver. The curious Carver may in brass, or stone, Carve Images, so he let God alone. 40. On Cassia. How fragrantly the Cassia smells, But Grace the sweetest sweets excels. 41. On a Cask. My soul is empty, Lord, make it thy task, To pour thy wine of grace into my cask. 42. On a Casket. Who ever wanteth wisdom, let him ask it Of God, to hold it in the heart's a Casket. 43. On a Cassock. Cassocks are in request with Levi's Race, No garment so becomes the soul, as Grace. 44. On a Cast-away. Tis hard to know, until the Judgement-day, Who is a Reprobrate, or Cast-away. 45. On Casting down. God humbles those whom he intends to crown His way of raising, is by casting down. 46. On Casting off. We must cast off the Works of Darkness e're We can put on, and Light's bright armour wear. 47. On a Castle. Sin, and the World, and our Corruptions wrastle Against us, but the Lord is our strong Castle. 48. On a Catch-pole. Satan that Catch-pole lurks in secret holes, To take advantage to undo our souls. 49. On a Cater. The Raven was a Cater to refresh Elijah twice a day, with Bread and Flesh. 50. On Catechising. Were more time spent in Catechising Youth, More would be constant lovers of the truth. 51. On Cates. Gods Ordinances those delicious Cates Are free for all men, He keeps open Gates. 52. On Caterpillars. How soon can God those Caterpillars kill, That to the Sons of Sion bear ill will. 53. On a Catarrhe. When we can mourn for sin, O then we are Bound to bless God, this is a good Catarrhe. 54. On a Cathedral. A den of Thieves is that Cathedral Church Become, whose Prelates live upon the lurch. 55. On a Catholick. He a true Catholick is not become, Who yields obedience to the Church of Rome. 56. On a Cat. The melancholy Cat for Mice doth watch, Satan to slay our souls lies at a Catch. 57. On Cattle. Since God hath given the Cattle for our use, To his dishonour let's not them abuse. 58. On a Caudle. A pleasing Caudle many love to sup, What sweetness is there in Salvations cup! 59. On a Cave. Christ is a Rock, and ev'ry wound a Cave, And whoso hides therein shall safety have. 60. On a Caveat. We may be angry, very zealous in A good cause, but beware we do not sin. 61. On a Cavalier of the worser sort. Canary, Sherry, Cider, Ale, or Beer, Will make him merry, that's a Cavalier: His King he honours, God he ought to fear, Since both by Solomon joyn'd, enjoyned are. 62. On a Caviller. Zoilus the Caviller finds fault with many, When 'tis well known he is as bad as any. 63. On a Cauldron. John in a Cauldron of hot burning oyl Was forc'd to stand, and him alive they boyl, 64. On a Cause. God is the causer of all good things still, As Satan is, and ever was, of ill. 65. On a Causey. Heav'ns Causey is strewd with rough flinty stones, But hels low-way is pavd with smoother ones 66. On Ceasing. There must be a ceasing from ill, before We can do well. Repent, and sin no more. 67. On a Cell. How sad is it for evermore to dwell With dev'ls, tormented in hells dismal Cell. 68. On Cement. Love is a Cement, joyning holy ones Together, it uniteth living stones. 69. On a Censer. My heart's a Censer, Lord, let the incense Of Prayr and Praises, weakly rising thence, Be to thy sacred Nostrils acceptable, Since I would offer better, were I able. 70. On Censuring. Men are by nature miserably prone To censure others, let themselves alone. Other mens motes we can with ease descry, But in the mean while our own beams pass by. 71. On a Center. The soul of man is not compleatly blest, Till it in God (its proper Center) rest. Still towards God a pious heart will roul, Because he is the Center of the soul, Immutable, and whose Perle herie, Drawn round about him, is Eternitie. 72. On a Centurion. He commands men, but he that can command Himself, is stronger than an armed band. 73. On Ceremonies. Since Christ became a real Sacrifice, The Law of Jewish Ceremonies is Abolish'd; there's a Consummatum est Giv'n to them all: all legal rites are ceast. Ere since the Temples veil was rent in sunder, No ritual Obligation keeps us under. Rome readmits them, the Saints are far from it, They loath to lick up the Galatians vomit. 74. On Certainty. He must be much in duty, must keep pure His heart, and still act faith, that would procure The Jewel of Assurance, which hath bin By Saints obtain'd, and may be so agen. 75. On a Certificate. Grant that Certificate, Lord, to my soul, The Leper had, Thy saith hath made thee whole. 76. On Ceruse. None but a Jezabel devoid of grace, With painting Ceruse will besmear her face. 77. On Cessing. What cessing of estates is here below? The Saints above no such taxations know, Praise is the tribute which to God they owe. 78. On a Chaffer. My heart's a chaffer, Lord let thy spirit blow Zeals dying coals in me, &amp; make them glow. 79. On Chaffe. Light, dry, and empty chaffe, God in his ire Will burn, with inextinguishable fire. 80. On a Chaine. Christ as a token of his love bestowes A chain of vertue, to adorn his Spouse. 81. On a Chair. A chair affords us ease, when tir'd we are; Tis dangerous sitting in the Scorners chaire. 82. On a Challenge. An angry word, calls on a challenge oft, But strife's diverted by an answer soft. 83. On a Chalice. Cast up we must the old leaven of malice; Ere we drink off the Sacramental Chalice. 84. On Chalk. The Spir't of God hath as it were with chalk, Mark'd out the way, wherein the Sts. do walk 85. On a Chamber. The Sts. by faith (that Jacobs Ladder) clamber Up to Heaven's glorious glistering Star-Chamber. 86. On a Champion. Our Champion Christ for us hath won the field, And made the pow'rs of hells dark Kingdom yield. 87. On Chance. All things to pass, Gods providence doth bring, Not the blind goddess chance, there's no such thing 88. On a Chancellour. This honour to each St. Gods Spirit doth deal, To be the keeper of the Kings Broad-Seal. 89. On Chanel. Lord let the chanel of free grace run in My soul, and that will purge out all my sin. 90. On Change. The whole world is a shop of change, for welth We exchange poverty; for sickness health; Pleasure for sorrow; and honour for scorn; Oft-times before, the evening and the morn. The day changes to night, the night to day, Summer to winter, youth to age gives way. 91. On a Chappel. God hath his Church, and tis observed where God's Church is, Satan hath his chappel neer 92. On a Chaplain. He is a chaplain for the Prince of Hell, That in debauchry bears away the Bell. 93. On a Chap-man. Satan's a chap-man, and his shop is fraught With wares, but all the ware he sells is naught. 94. On Charges. Christ will not put the Soul to any charges, Love only he desires for his free Largess. 95. On a Charge. God hath a Book to Register mens sins, And when the day of Judgment once begins, It shall be op'd, O then what a black charge Against a Sinner shall be read at large. I will reprove thee, and in order place Thine open-secret-sins before thy face; This done the Judge shall sentence in his ire The cursed into everlasting fire. 96. On a Charger. My heart's a Charger, Lord scour off all sin, And put the sweet-meats of thy grace therein 97. On a Chariot. Pray'r is a Charret, it to heaven brings, And draws down blessings from the King of Kings. 98. On Charity. Char'ty increaseth Faith, begetteth Hope, Makes us at one with God, it is the scope Of the whole Dec'logue; it do all things can, It is man's way to God, God's way to man. It's now grown old and cold, there's many do Talk on't, 'tis understood but of a few. The Heart must be the Spring, the Hand the Pipe, The Poor the Cistern, what we cannot keep, Let's freely give, that we may in the close Receive those things which we can never lose. Si desit charitas frustra habentur cætera. Aug. Da quod non potes retinere, ut recipias quod non potes amittere. 99. On Charms. The Worlds a Circe, O what various harms, Trip on the heels of her enchanting charms! 100. On a Charter. All things are a Believers future glory And present blessings, a large Inventory. Because God unto him his Heir doth grant The Covenant of Grace; the Covenant Is our great Charter, free Grace doth restore To us what Sin had robb'd us of before. I am God, ev'n thy God, surely all things Are ours, if God (who is the King of Kings) B'ours, and we have in God an interest, By vertue of our being link'd to Christ. By faith in Christ we have a title to All things in Heav'n above, and Earth below. 101. On Chastity. Chastity is the mark denotes the Just, It curbs with Reason's reins the rage of Lust. 'Tis beauty to our souls, (whom it attires) Grace to our body, peace to our desires. It is the glory of our lives, and there It doth grow cheap, where gold is not though dear. Chastity, without charity to feed And nourish't, is a Lamp that oyl doth need: Chastity wrong'd, abides, it but once ends, It with the beauty very much contends. ? nulla roparabilis arte. Læsa pudicitia est deperitilla semel, Lis est cum forma magna pudicitiæ. 102. On Chastisements. Who knows not that he hath offended, Will not be scourg'd nor soon amended; But I have sinn'd and here I stand To bear the blows, thy chasting hand, Shall lay upon me; O my God Reform me, by thy tut'ring Rod. Qui peccare se nescit corrigi non vult; deprehendas te oportet, antequam emendes. Sen. 103. On Chattering. Good Hezekiah, chattering like a Crane Was heard by Heaven, and healed of his pain. 104. On the Chancery. There is no Chancery court in Heaven above, Where all the Sts. are linck'd in endless love 105. On Cheapness. The Prince of darkness, is content that thou Shouldst have pleasures &amp; riches cheap enow; Only give him thy soul; indulge to vice, Ad he is satisfy'd, the greatest price That can be given, he asks; and yet he tells His customers cheap are the wares he sells, Nor are his wares, if rightly understood, But the meer forms, and counterfeits of good: God gives abundantly to all that lack Real good things, and taketh nothing back. Come you that have no money; come and buy Blessings and graces, without price; deny He will not any, since the best things are Best cheap, to spare to ask them, folly 'twere. 106. On Cheer. Blessed are they, which called are unto The marri'ge Supper of the Lamb, who go To feast with Christ in Heaven; unto the house Of Banqueting, Christ will conduct his Spouse To eat of his rare Vvands there, is there No dish we do not love; delightful cheer. Christ will prepare for his beloved ghest, Such sav'ry meat as she (he's sure) likes best; The various fulness in Christ will prevent A scarcity, this cheer is never spent: At this feast there's no want, both rich and poor, Who eat thereof, shall never hunger more. 107. On Chearfulness. How are the Angels ravish'd with delight, While they are praysing God! a gracious sprite Serves God with cheerfulness, he only can Be truly chearful; that's an upright man. 108. On a Cheat. Satan's a Sophister, he hath Decoys To draw us in, and cheat us of our Joys. 109. On a Check. The Flesh let's loose the Reins, We gallop into Sin, The Spirits Check restreins And pulls us back agin. 110. On Cheeks. Christ's cheeks are as a Bed of fragrant Spices His Aromatick vertues love entices. 111. On Cheese. Job compassed about with miseries. Tells God that he had curdled him like cheese Job 10. 10. 112. On the chief Good. It is not every good that makes us blest, But it must be the sov'raign good, the best: Blessedness lies in the fruition Of the chief good, and that is God alone. God as the first beginning, and the last End of all good, must be by us embrac'd. God only is of all felicity The cause, and frees us from all misery. God only can in life and death appease The troubled conscience, give the afflicted ease. In God alone when evils us surround Perfect and solid comfort can be found. No rest is here below, (my Soul) adventure To Heav'n, and fix on God thine only center. 113. On a Cherry. How pleasing is a Cherry to the sight And taste; Grace to the Soul yields more delight. 114. On a Chest. The Miser locks up treasure in his chest, And we should store up Graces in our brest. 115. On a Chick. The Chick is safe hous'd under the Hens wings, So we protected by the King of Kings. 116. On a Chider. Soft answers lessen wrath, he that's a Chider Launces the Bile, and makes the breach the wider. 117. On Children. Peace-makers are the children of the High'st, Not by eternal generation, Christ Alone is so; nor only by creation But chiefly by real sanctification. Adoption and infusion of Grace, Our childship consists in, we are (alas!) Not born, but made Gods children, since we are Not sons till we o' the Divine Nature share. Th'impulsive cause is Gods free Grace, the cause Organical is Faith, 'tis Faith which draws Whole Christ into the heart, him there applies; This filiating Grace to Christ us ties. By faith we are made one with Christ, and so Become a kin to God; b'ing lincked to The nat'ral son, our brother Christ we gather, We are Gods children, he our loving father: God's children have his spirit, for sin are sorry, Are zealous for his Day, his Truth, his Glory: Love to enjoy each others companie, And in Gods presence, delight much to be, Are like their Heavenly father, and his will They always are ambitious to fulfil, Yea make it their ambition to draw in Others to be of the same Royal-kin. Sinners made sons! O love to be admir'd, We neither it deserv'd, nor it desir'd: God's children are the royal Diadem, He makes a precious account of them, Creates them noble persons; them doth crown With honour, they have titles of renown. They are call'd Kings, th'excellent of the earth, And their rich Scutchions shew their Heav'nly birth The Scripture hath set forth their Heraldry, Sometimes they give the Eagle flying high, To heav'n upon the wings of faith and love; Sometimes they give the meek &amp; harmless Dove; Sometimes they give as we in Scripture find, The Lyon, shewing their couragious mind. Adam was in his innocent estate, The world's sole Monarch, the Regenerate Have higher Honour, more renowned are, Adam was (though a bright) yet falling Star. Adam's estate was glorious, yet unstable, And soon was lost, theirs is unalterable. Gods children are equal in glory to The Angels, this themselves acknowledge do, I am thy fellow-servant, in some sense They are above them, in preheminence. The Angels are their servants to attend, And wait upon them to their Journeys end. Besides, Christ honoured their nature more, By taking it; though by creation lower They are then Angels, by adoption higher Advanced are they, then the blessed Quire. They have a fairer Coat of Arms to shew Then Angels, let's their Priviledges view; God loves them well, though for a while he may Withdraw from them, yet long he cannot stay: He will bear with many infirmities, And will accept of their weak services: Provide for them he will, he gives them their Allowance dayly, and he doth prepare A portion for them, which can never be Summ'd up to them, he granteth liberty. He skreens off dangers from them, temporal And spir't'al evils hurt them not at all. God will reveal his Law to them, they may Go to their Father, and with boldness pray; They're heirs to all the promises, they shall Their Fathers blessing have for their good all. Good things, means, mercies, evil things also. Poverty, sickness, shame, suff'rings, death too, Shall work together: Christ for them did die, And they shall never perish finally. These are the glorious priviledges that Attend Gods children: Try we our estate, If we are sanctifi'd by God's good spirit, We are adopted, and shall Heav'n inherit. O let's walk as Gods children, yielding still Loving Obedience to our Fathers Will. Are we the children of the High'st? And is our elder brother Christ? O never let's begin To fall in league and match with sin: Better for ever single tarry, Then with the Devils daughter marry. 'Tis dangerous to dote upon her, It will degrade us of our Honour. Her Dowry is the horrid chains Of darkness, and eternal pains, The gnawing Worm, sharp whips of Wire, And streams of sulph'ry-flaming fire. 118. On the Chimes. Sweet is the Musick of a chime of Bells, But Heavens diviner harmony excells. 119. On a Chimney. It is in Winter warm, in Summer chill, We all the year are burning hot to ill. 120. On a Chinke. Fill up each chink of our desires none can But God alone; the World is empty, vain. 121. On a Chin. A man may have a well thatch'd chin, Yet freez for want of zeal within. 122. On a Chip. A ciens graffed in a righteous stock, Was once a chip of the old (Adams) block. 123. On a Chirurgeon. He is the chief and best Chirurgeon who Can heal Soul-wounds, this Christ alone can do. 124. On Chivalry. To overcome our selves and die To Sin, is the best Chivalry. 125. On Choler. A man exceeding teasty grows When yellow choler overflows. But Grace the Passions subdues. 126. On Choosing. Martha minds the World, while Mary Chose the one thing necessary; So will ev'ry gracious heart, Always choose the better part. 127. On Chrystal. The Law's a Crystal Glass, wherein We see the ugly face of Sin. 128. On Christ. 1 Christ is a Panoplie, a Magazin Of all good things, a Jewel of great worth, A thousand Treasuries of Joy are in His name, 'tis sweet as Ointment poured forth. 'Tis th'only Musick to a Christians ear, And oh that in our hearts it graven were! 2 He that hath Christ, can have no more, for Christ Is all that is, imaginable all That is desirable, he is the High'st, All Heavenly blessings from this Fountain fall. We are made right'ous by his only Merit, And holy by his sanctifying Spirit. 3 His Spir't burns up our dross, &amp; makes our graces Sparkle like furnace gold, Christ the mind fills With light in us, a tender heart he places; And files off the Rebellion of our Wills. Upon the Soul he rises, and he brings An healing vertue in his balmie wings. 4 God is through Christ propitious to us, And also in good part takes all we do; Christ bears Saints names upon his brest, and thus His Father he presenteth them unto; So bringing them into request and favour, How sweet to God, Christ off'red prayers savor 5 Christ keeps the Royal Fort of Grace, that it Be not blown up, Christ is a Christians strength; The Crown of the Saints vict'ries must be set Upon Christs head, he gives to us at length Our Garland, when we overcome by fight, Which we can never do, but through his might 6 Kings can proclaim War in a time of Peace, But Christ proclaims Peace in a time of War. He gives the agonized Conscience ease; By him to God we reconciled are. What a sweet calm and Sabbath in the Soul He causes! O this Balm can make us whole! 7 Christ di'd, that us to life he might advance, He's gone before to take possession Of Heaven in the name of all the Saints, And he prepares for ev'ry one a throne. He crowns us after all our suff'rings And actings for him, we shall reign as Kings. 8 Vast is the disproportion between Christ and the Creature; Christ is all in all, The Creature nothing, emptiness is in All earthly comforts, what a bubble Ball Is this vain World? (the object of Saints loathing) And yet how many damn their souls for nothing! 9 Christ is the great Lord Treasurer, in him Are hid all Treasures both of Grace and Glory; O how should we this pearl of price esteem, He that hath Christ hath a rich Inventory: How should a Christian sit down satisfi'd With Christ, though other things are him deni'd. 10 A man may flow in wealth and yet be poor, Not having Christ, but he that Christ possesses With all his royalties, needs nothing more, A Christless state is sad beyond expresses. He that wants Christ, is a vile filthy slave, And can no comfort, no salvation have. 11 Sinners make sure of Christ, O never cease Trading in Ord'nances, till you have got This blessed pearl of price; Christ Jesus is With all accumulated good things fraught. Two words there are which only yield satiety Unto the Soul, Diety and Propriety. 12 Christ's an enriching blessing that excels A supream good, a good sufficient And suitable in him all fulness dwells; In him alone we can find true content. He's Grace, Gold, Balm, Bread, Wine, Salvation, To deck, enrich, heal, strengthen, comfort, crown. 13 He is a shield, if we in danger are; Are we disconsolate, he is a Sun; He hath enough to furnish souls and spare; My empty soul to his abundance run. Christ is all that the heart can wish; a man No Cistern needs, who hath the Ocean. 14 Christ is a sanctifying good, he all Conditions to us facilitates; His blessings on our health, wealth, kindred fall, Yea, all our comforts he condulcorates, Sanctifies all the crosses on us roul, They shall be medicinal to the soul. 15 Christ is a blessing rare, but him few have, Those to whom God hath both the Indies given He hath not given Christ their souls to save, They have Earths fat, but not the dew of Heaven. And of those many Protestants who hear Of Christ, but few him in their hearts do bear. 16 Christ is a crowning blessing, a choice good; God gives thee all he hath in giving him, A greater favour cannot be bestow'd By the great God, oh highly it esteem: God gives to thee the blessings of his Throne, In giving thee his well-beloved Son. 17 Christ is a lasting good, all other things Are like the Lamp, which while it shines it spends: He's a diffusive good, free merry Springs From this full Fountain; common good commends The Donors bounty. Lord, let Christ be mine; All to me both for food and medicine. 18 Christ is our King, he governs and protects us; Christ is our Priest, he ransoms &amp; redeems us; Christ is our Prophet, he teaches and directs us. What tongue can tel how highly he esteems us? Christ is our Way, Truth, Life, to guide, teach, cherish, How can we go amiss, or er, or perish! 19 My Soul! part with thy Lusts for Christ thy King, Know him in the first place; O let the streams Of Love run toward him; do ev'ry thing In his strength, make Christ all in all thy aims: Who aims not at Gods Glory never can Hit the mark of his own salvation. 20 Trust for Salvation to a Jesus single, The Papists make Christ somthing, but not all, Their merits &amp; Angels pray'rs, with christ's they mingle, Rejoyce in Christ, upon him often call For Christ be thankful, and in praises flow, A greater gift than Christ God cann't bestow. 129. On Christianity. Christianity is no disgraceful thing, Sin brings to shame; but godliness doth bring To honour, to a throne: it always ends In glory, no disgrace to be Christ's friends: To be an heir of Heaven, is high renown; Sin draws hell after it, but grace a crown. 130. On a Christian. 1 Christ is affixed to a Christian's heart By thought, desire, love, faith; in conversation He is link'd fast to Christ, never to part, And hath those prelibations of salvation, Of joyes long-lasting, and soul-satisfying: Grace makes the St. rejoyce to think of dying. 2 A Christian engraffed in the Vine, Produceth kindly, seasonable fruit; Grace within, good works without him shine, And good discourses from his lips flow out; He mourns for sin, rejoyceth in the Lord, He reads, and feeds upon the sacred word. 3 A Christian is a runner in a race; Enfir'd with zeal, the marks he always eyes, Is often in the exercise of grace, And in the strength of Christ obtains the prize: My soul throw off two weights, the World and Sin, Begin the race betimes, hold on and win. 130. On a Christless person. 1 A Christless man is poor, he's nothing worth, He stands condemned for the guilt of sin, He hath no holiness to let him forth, He's filthy; like an Infant tumbling in It's blood; i'th' law what was the Leper foul, But the sad embleme of a Christless soul? 2 A Christless wretch in Scripture is compar'd To things most vile, as to a Swine, a Dog, A Viper, nay a Devil; he's all besmeard With filthy lusts, his hearts a rotten bog: Sin's Plague-sores run upon him, blind he is; And the more blind, because he thinks he sees. 3 He's dead, and yields a most unsav'ry smell, So that God loaths him, he hath no part sound; He is th'exact Epitome of Hell, From him nothing but dregs is running found; He is base born, caught in the Devils gins, An ear-board slave when he most freely sins. 4 Can he find comfort when he comes to dye? His wounds do bleed, &amp; he hath no Physitian; He is in debt, and hath no surety, A Christless, is a comfortless condition: He no salvation hath; at the great day, The very looks of Christ shall him dismay. 131. On the Church. To see God's Church a bleeding vine, to see Christsspouse with garments roll'd in bloud should be Matter of lamentation to all That God their father, her their mother call: Tis time to hang upon the limber willowes, Our mournful harps, when on the ruffling billows Of sad afflictions, the Church Gods Ark Is tossed like a weather-beaten Bark: But let's not fret, for the Almighties hand That guides the Stream, can bring it safe to land, Land he will; sinking it need not fear, Tis alway under his indulgent care: The Churches ship may reel because of sin, But cannot perish, for Christ is therein: The Churches Anchor is in Heaven cast, Saints are his portion, and shall that be lost? His glory, and shall that ecclipsed be, Wholy, and finally! no certainly, From, and by opposition, God can His Church deliver; oft the wrath of man, Works or his praise; the Lord steps forth &amp; saves His Ship, when almost swallow'd by the waves: The Churches pangs Gods glory doth advance, And shall help forward her deliverance. God hath by sufferings alwayes propagated Religion, it hath risen when conculcated, Bloud is the Churches seed, in bloud tis founded By sanguine showrs, it evermore abounded, Abel by bloudy Cain was murthered, And ever since the Churches veins have bled; But she is like the Vine which grows by bleeding, And like the Palm-tree under pressures spreading 132. On a Churl. A clownish churl, or churlish clown By's words, Saints by their works, are known. 133. On Cider. A glass of sparkling Demock wine is good; But O how cheering is my Saviors blood? Pomona's Orchards never could produce A liquor of such admirable use. 134. On a Cymbal. Cymbals were us'd in former dayes, To sound forth Gods diviner praise. 135. On Cinders. We are a sinful people, O what hinders Us Sodom like from being burnt to cinders! 136. On Cinnamon. Arabia sends us Spicy Cinnamon, Our fragrant graces flow from Christ alone; Sweet-wood yields not so redolent a smell As do those vertues, which in Christ Spouse dwell. Legitur Exod. 30. 23. and Cant. 4. 14. Ducamus a canna vel a cantignum &amp; nama dulce. 137. On the Cinque-Ports. Our senses are the Cinque-ports of the soul, Satan and sin at every little hole Strive to creep in, unless we stand upon Our guard, we shall for ever be undone. 138. On a Cipher. Who doth no good when he hath sin forsook, Stands for a cipher in Gods counting book 139. On Cipras. Fine Cipras-veiles fair Ladies wear Over their curious shaded hair, O yet your hearts with graces deckt; So Christ himself shall you affect. 140. On a Circle. The world's a circle, therefore never can Fill the triangulated heart of man. 141. On a Circuit. Gods Justice rides in circuit, he is bent To punish sinners, yet how few repent! 142. On Circumcision. The Badge whereby Gods people once were known From forreigners, was circumcision; Since circumcision of the outward part Is ceas'd, Lord! circumcise thy servants heart. 143. On Circumference. We by a pair of compasses, Gods law Should th'whole circumf'rence of our lives draw, Let's fix on God our center, and go still By practise round the compass of his will: Lord! let the lines of my peripherie, In thee my center evermore agree. 144. On Circumspection. Who hath with Mary chose the better part, Is careful to preserve grace in his heart; He plies the Ordinances breast; he hath Fear while he sojourns here, yet lives by Faith. 145. On a City. Jerusalem which is above, is free, The mother of us all; what liberty, And safe protection is there in that City, Whose King, and Governour is God Almighty? Angels (the great Kings courtiers) who are here Our Guardians, are our companions there. Socrates being ask'd, what country man He was, replied, I'me the worlds Citizen: This answer by a Christian may be given, I am a free-born Citizen of Heaven. 146. On a Cistern. My heart's a cistern, may the stream of grace From God the Fountain, run therein apace. 147. On a Citron. Much us'd in Physick is the citron juyce, But o what rare effects doth grace produce! 148. On Civet. Sweet Civet is but sweat, arising from Civet-cats cods, grace is the best perfume. 149. On Civility. Who is unto civility inclin'd, That ceremonial grace, commends his mind; Yet men may in morality excell, As Prudence, Temperance, and go to hell: Mortality may as well damn as sin, And therefore is not to be rested in. Cleans'd must the sacrifices inward be, God he respects, and crowns hearts-puritie; Civil'ty washes but the outward part, Grace th'inward: Blessed are the pure in heart. 150. On Clay. Should God but breath on us; or take away The breath he gave us, what were we but clay! 151. On a Clame. The Saints lay clame to heaven; &amp; reason good Twas purchas'd for them, by their Saviors blood. 152. On Clamour. Sin in the ears of justice, sound as loud As thunder breaking from a rumbling cloud. 153. On a Clapper. The mouth's a Bell, Gods praise cannot be rung Unless we use the clapper of the tongue. 154. On a Clark. A clark may by his Bell, call others in To worship God, while he himself serve sin. 155. On a Clasp. The Cov'nant is a golden clasp, whereby God us t'himself, himself to us doth tye. 156. On a Clause. Some-what injurious to God's greatness tis, T'imprison him, in a Parenthesis. 157. On Claws. Great Judah's Lyon, hath adunced claws, To tear the wilful breakers of his Laws. 158. On a Claw-back. All is not Gospel that the claw-back sayes, Yet to be dispraised by him is a praise. 159. On Cleansing. By nature we are all defil'd with sin, And with the Leper must cry out, Unclean. Sin is an impure [?] Issue, none can bring Purity thence, tis a polluting thing; A sinner's heart's so black, that only hell Can pattern it, and be it's paralell; But Grace is a spirit'al Lavor, stil'd Regenerations washing; Souls defil'd, Faith &amp; Repentance cleanse; Grace lays the soul A whitening, searches wounds, and makes them whole. Grace is of a Celestial nature, though it Wholly remove not sin, it doth subdue it; Mary's tears as they washed Christs feet, so Her heart; Grace engraves holiness unto The Lord upon the heart, in character, Indelible; to Glory Grace prefers. 160. On Clearness. The bodies of the Saints made more divine, More clearly than the Sun at Noon shall shine cleave 161. On Cleaving. God is the sov'raign good, he that would To him by Faith, must the ungodly leave. 162. On Clemency. Clemency is the Ornament of Kings, Surer is the security it brings, Because frequent revenge allays the hate Of few, but is doth all men irritate. That Prince will be belov'd, &amp; long shall stand, Who rules his Subjects with a gentle hand. Salvum regem in aperto clementia præstabit. Sen. 163. On a Clerk. The greatest Clerk, the Proverb says, Is not the wisest man always. 164. On a Clew. The clew-thred of Christs men its leads us thro The winding Labyrinths of Sin and Wo. 165. On a Client. I am a Client unskill'd in the Laws, And Satan Articles against me draws, But Christ my Advocate doth plead my cause. 166. On a Cliff. The Cliff repells the Oceans pride, Saints built on Christ can Storms deride. 167. On a Climate. Some that through many Climates run, Are yet unto themselves unknown. 168. On Climbing. High winds shake most the Cedars tall, Haman by climbing got a fall. 169. On a Clyster. The Clyster frees the Head from pains, Grace from the Heart corruption dreins. 170. On a Clock. The Clock tells us each hour in the day How by degrees our time doth steal away, Therefore we still had need to Watch and Pray. 171. On a Clog. The World's a Clog, which doth controul The motion of the mounting Soul. 172. On a Cloyster. A man, a Cloyster may be shut up in, And yet his Soul take liberty to sin. 173. On a Cloak. Zeal as a Cloak our Saviour clad Es. 59. 17., No better garment can be had. 174. On a Closet. God Closet-prayers doth regard, And them will openly reward. 175. On Clothing. Sweet Jesu deck me with thy right'ous cloathing, So shall mine be the object of my loathing. 176. On Cloves. As Cloves send forth a very fragrant smell, So do the Graces that the Saints in dwell. 177. On a Cloud. The Clouds of our Offences intervene, So that Gods Sun-bright eye cannot be seen. Clouds are the Magazines of Snow and Rain, Our Sins do in them vert'ally contain Treasures of vengeance, sin makes Heav'n frown, And then thick showrs of wrath come tumbling down. 178. On a Clout. Self-right'ousness enwrapping us about, Is as a rotten ragg, or menstrous Clout. 179. On a Clown. As civilized Citizens disown The rude behaviour of the hob-nail'd Clown, So Saints from Sinners by their lives are known. 180. On a Club. The Club of vengeance knocks down those, Who out of malice God oppose. 181. On a Cluster. Christ is the Vine, and Clusters full of juice Hang upon him, for the Believers use. 182. On a Coach. Pray'r is a Coach which by the Spirit driven, Hurries our Souls into the Courts of Heaven. 183. On a Coal. Lord touch my tongue with a coal taken fro Thine Altar, so shall I thy praises show. 184. On a Coast. Heaven is a securer Coast, The Saints are thither riding Post. 185. On a Coat. Who cuts his Coat according to His cloth, shall not a begging go. 186. On a Coat of Mail. The Coat of Mail preserves the body whole: Nothing but Faith in Christ can save the soul. 187. On a Cobler. The Cobler draws through Aul-made holes His ends, and lives by mending soles: But ah, Soul-ruines, who condoles! 188. On a Cobweb. The Spider spreads her Fly-entangling Nets, Snares to trepan the Saints, the Sinner sets. 189. On a Cockatrice. They who indulgence give to filthy vices, Do hatch the poysonous eggs of Cockatrices; ‘Mischiefs are like the Cockatrices eye, ‘If they see first, they kill; foreseen, they die. 190. On a Cock. The Bird that warned Peter of his fall, Doth us betimes to our devotion call. 191. On a Cockney. The Cockney that is up so nicely brought, Soon shews that he was better fed then taught 192. On a Cockle. The Cockle from her shell abhors to come, So a good House-wife loves to stay at home. 193. On Co-Essential, Co-Equal, Co-Eternal. God, Christ, the Spir't, are but one supernal, Co-equal, Co-essential, Co-eternal: Thrice blessed, Three in One, and One in Three, May I adore, admire, love none but Thee, My Maker, Saviour, Consolation: O please to make my heart thy lesser Throne. 194. On a Coffer. A dunghil wretch for Gold of Ophir, Will damn his Soul, to cram his Coffer 195. On a Coffin. The greatest King that ever Scepter sway'd, At last is in a narrow Coffin lay'd. 196. On a Cognizance. Want is the Badge of Poverty, the Saints Have Crowns and Scepters for their cognizance 197. On a Co-heir. Art thou a Saint? thou art Co-heir with Christ; And highly art in favour with the High'st. 198. On Coin. The golden Saints for current Coin will pass, In Heavens Kingdom; Hell is all for Brass. 199. On a Coit. To cast the Coit is pretty childish play. It's sad for Coin to sling the Soul away. 200. On a Cullender. Our mem'ries like the Cullender that streins Pure liquor out, but drossie dregs reteins. 201. On Cold. Are we as cold as Aspine Snow, Or as the frozen Zone; The Fire we know, will make us glow, Grace warms a heart of stone. 202. On Coldness in Religion. Some Jehu-like drive furiously for Heaven, But of their Chariot wheels are soon bereaven. Their Spring is turn'd to Autumn, &amp; their gold To clay; their zeal for God is grown key-cold. Sad Times! Men cast Religion out of place, Rather then bear for it the least disgrace. So little zeal is for Gods glory shown, That sure we live under the frozen Zone. 203. On a Collar. The Collar checks the Stallion in, Restraining Grace keeps men from sin. 204. On Collection. The World is a Collection of all The Creatures; 'tis a very goodly Ball. 205. On a Colledge. Heav'n is a Colledge, Saints Christs Scholars here. Are Angels Fellows when once entred there? 206. On a Colleague. Angels are our Colleagues and we must still Praise God, and readily obey his Will. 207. On a Collier. The Devil and Collier are alike for hew, Both black; and so are we till born anew. 208. On the Collick. Pain damps our mirth, small mind hath he to frolick, That's pained with the Belly-wringing Collick. 209. On Colours. The Star-embellish'd Bird which Juno so Admires, th'embroidred skie-adorning Bow Presaging showrs, eye-pleasing colours show, Which men born blind cannot distinctly know. We cannot know the things that do concern Our peace, till God be pleas'd to make us learn. 210. On a Column. The Fabrick of the Heav'ns do lean upon No other Column, but Gods Word alone. 211. On a Combat. Two sons of Valour dealt so thick their blows, As that one Sword unto the other owes No wound, they slic'd each other while their bloud Commix'd together, made one crimson Floud. At last these Combatants of Mars both fell And made their clashing armouring their Knell. We must all our Soul-Enemies knock down Before we can obtain a Victors Crown. 212. On a Comb. The Comb is us'd to plain the hair Grace only makes the Soul look fair. 213. On Commination. Gods dreadful threatnings give man warning do, Before his Murd'ring-pieces give the blow. O when God menaceth, let us begin To quake and greatly tremble, lest by sin We should occasion his severer frown, And on our heads denounced Plagues draw down God warn'd us hath, some judgments he hath sent And more will come, if England not repent. 214. On Cumbrance. Much business Martha distracts, Whilst Mary the best things affects. 215. On Combustion. The Waters of Repentance can Allay the flame of sin in man. 216. On a Comedie. A comedie is turbulent at first, But calm at last. Good Times succeed the worst, Though now we mourn, our God will comfort send, A sad beginning hath a joyful end. 217. On Comliness. The Church is Beauties Magazin, Her comliness is all within, Without she hath a tawny skin. Her misery hath tann'd her so, But Mercy which from Christ doth flow, Can make her fairer than the Snow. 218. On a Comet. When God hangs out the dismal blazing Star, Portending Famine, Pestilence and War, Foretelling change of Governments and Times, He means to punish our offending Crimes. Now if we would such dire effects prevent, Return we must, and speedily repent. Three Comets lately shin'd, and thousands are Dead with the Plague, &amp; hundreds fall'n by War. And oh that Prince, and Priest, and People too, Would keep a Fast indeed, and not in show. Return we must, and suddenly repent, Or else our Plagues will more and more augment. 219. On Comfort. Mourning precedes, and comfort doth ensue, The wound is launc'd, then cur'd, that is the true Sun-shine of joy, which comes after a showr Of tears, God his best Wine doth last forth pour. First he prescribes sorrow for sin, anon Broaches the Wine of Consolation. The Devil contrarily shews the best first, And keeps till last (for a reserve) the worst: He first presents the sug'red meats of Sin, And after the sad reck'ning is brought in; When he had shew'd Judas the silver bait, He struck him with the Hook, and caught him strait. God pours the golden oyl of Joy into The broken vessel, his choice comforts flow In, while tears are pour'd out, sad nights of sorrow Are Ushers to a glorious shining morrow. The comforts of Gods Spirit, are real, pure, Holy, soul-filling, sweet, lasting, secure, Glorious, transporting, cordial comforts, none But Saints shall sit with, Christ upon the Throne; And sit down with him at the Table, where Cœlestial delicates provided are. Although the Seeds-time of the Saints be wet, Yet they shall with a joyful Harvest meet. Gods Sun-bright face, all sorrow shall destroy, And turn their Tears into the Wine of Joy. 220. On Commands Legal, Evangelical. Christ is the King of Kings (by him Kings reign) And shall not he royal Edicts Ordain To rule his Subjects by? 'tis well for Saints That they are check'd by awful Laws restraints. Th'heart would be ready to run wild in sin, Did not Christs Law coerce and hold it in. How many now are in the Devils Pound, That from Christs Precepts have been stragling sound! A godly man to God and Christ his laws Consents, obeys in love; Gods Spirit draws I'th' yoke with us, as a divine Loadstone It moves the heart, which cannot move alone. It blows upon the soul, and with its gales Quickens in duty, the affections sails. All Christs commands are very profitable; Centring in blessedness, are honourable; Are nectariz'd with jov, are transitory, Saints now under the Yoke, shall rest in Glory. Needs must the Laws and Statutes Christ enacts, Be Eligible then for these respects. The Gospels golden mandates easie are, Compared to the Moral Law severe; This, bids us Do and Live, That our desires Accepts; Pers'nal Obedience This requires; A surety That admits; This bids and threats, But strengthens not to do; That power lets Into the soul; its Precepts sweetned be With promises, where is sincerity God in the Gospel winks at our defects; The Law perfect Obedience exacts. Christs Laws are sweet and easie, if compar'd To sins commands; Sin presses down as hard As Lead, how easie are the Laws of Grace Oppos'd to Hell! Hell is a restless place. If Christs Commands we in the Ballance poyse With Heavens Glory, and eternal Joys, How light they are! what disproportion Is there between our Service and the Crown Of recompence, our travels and our pains Are grains, compar'd with future massie gains. O love the ways of God, and always bow To Christs commands, Believers are not now Under the thundring curses of the Law, No, nor its Ceremonies; Stand in aw, Yet serve God out of choice; his Law is right, His yoke is easie, and his burthen light; Think of the joy, the glory, the reward Of godliness, Duty will not seem hard. 221. On a Commander. Death over-came men-conq'u'ring Alexander, But was subdu'd by Christ, the worlds Commander, Christ by his death far greater conquests gain'd Then Alexander all his life obtain'd, Death yields to him, death that doth all devour, And Satan too, is vanquish'd by his power. 222. On Commendation. The Saint's an Angel drest in flesh and blood; His inclinations do aim at good; His vertues are too great to be reveal'd, And yet (me thinks) too great to be conceal'd: Grace doth advance him far beyond the Pen, Or the weak knowledge of admiting men, No flowing language, nor words richest dress And loft'st sence, can his full worth express, Then since thou canst not paint him life &amp; limb, Admire Gods goodness in admiting him. 223. On a Comment. Bad is that comment which corrupts the text, Such is the Rhemist to Gods word annex't. 224. On Commerce. Saints have commerce with God by ordinances, Before to heav'nly Thrones he them advances. 225. On the comming of Christ. God sent to us his Son, who to us brought Salvation, who nor deserv'd nor sought It of him; he came of his own accord, He was not fetch'd nor forc'd; th'essential Word Came to men, as when he was incarnate, Comes in men by his Spirit of Grace of late; And he with great Authority shall come Against men at the dreadful day of Doom: Then shall he as an Advocate appear To plead for Saints; and as a Judge to clear And crown them too, when Soul and Body shall Be reunited and enrich'd with all The wealth of Heaven; O thrice blessed day! Wherein Christ shall in his most rich array Appear triumphantly, and shine more bright Then Midday-Phœbus. O reviving sight! O what transcendent beauty will adorn Christs person at the Resurrections morn! How glorious will his Throne be! he shall sit Upon a Throne of Glory for him fit. How glorious shall his Attendants be! Heav'ns Courtiers shall bear him company. To his bright Throne; his Majesty hath been Despis'd, now must his mighty Pow'r be seen. At first he in Humility appear'd, In Glory now, of all the Saints admir'd. Then with poor Shepherds, now with Angels bright, Then the contempt of Nations, now t'affright And startle the ungodly World, then crown'd With thorns, but now with Majesty renown'd; Then judg'd by one man, judging now alone All men; then in a Cratch, now in a Throne. Where Christ is come, he sin doth chase, Reigns as a King, infers his Grace, The Son of man came from Heav'ns coast, To seek and save that which was lost. Then in our hearts he does appear, When we into's own Image are Transformed by his working Grace, And do his holiness embrace. When he to serve him makes us able, This is a comming comfortable. When to us he his Spirit imparts, O then he enters in our hearts; A Christ without's not worth a pin, Unless we have a Christ within. Christ comes to us, and shall not we Come to him? Gross stupidity! Christ in us, us with Graces stores, O let's not thrust him out of doors, But entertain him as our King, And his immortal praises sing. 226. On coming to Christ. When Jesus Christ is by his spirit about T'invade the sinners soul, he shuts him out. A gracious soul although he bar out sin, Opens his heart, to let the spirit in; What er'e are the diseases of the soul, O sinner! come to Christ to make thee whole; By faith come to him, and on him be clearing, There's no way for a cure but by believing, Faith is the applying of Christs merit &amp; blood, Receits, if unappli'd, will do no good: The son of God comes to the sons of men, And shall alas! the sons of men disdain To come to th'son of God; proud dust wilt thou Not meet thy Maker; thy Redeemer too? Sinners draw near if you desire a pardon, Come to him, you shall have him in his Garden, Th'assemblies of the saints, Lo! Manna lies At your door, gather it if you be wise: O come a little way to him that came So far for you, come out of sin for shame; Christ hath sent many preachers to invite Us to salvation, but them we slight, Demanding where? they answer, come and see, (As Philip told Nathaniel) but we Will not come neer, but at a distance stand, Christ cannot see us on the coming hand: The world, care, and the flesh, three mischievous Remora's do from coming hinder us; Christ himself calls, yet ah! you will not come To me for life, sure men are deaf and dumb. Christ comes amongst us Christians, to his own, But he is not received, O heart of stone! Our coming near to Christ is not in place, (So wicked men are neer him) but in grace And quality, being as he is holy, He must first draw us from our sinful folly, By grace, ere we can come, which being done By true repentance after him, we run. Man come to Christ when he come out of sin, And no man can come out, till Christ come in. 227. On a Commissary. The ravenous Raven was Gods commissary, Provision to Elisha for to carry. 228. On a Commission. The Father to his Son commission gave, To come lost sinners for to seek and save, A bleeding Christ will broken hearts recover, He comes to heal, read his Commission Luk. 4. 18. over, Me hath he sent to heal the broken hearted, Lost sinners are by him call'd, and converted. 229. On Commodities. The best of our commodities do come By water, weeping brings us comfort home. 230. On Common things. That which is common, proper is to no man, For how can it be proper since tis common? Nor can it still be said t'excell the rest, For what is common is not always best. 231. On a Common-Wealth. A common-wealth consists of two things still, Reward for good, and punishment for ill. That common-weal becomes a common woe, Where vertue finds no friend, and vice no foe. 232. On Commotion. He who allays the furious raging Ocean, Can pacifie the peoples mad commotion. 233. On Communicativeness. The best things most communicative are, Of what they have, what benefits is there Of Diamonds in rocks; the end alone Of life is usefulness; the cloud pour down Their silver showrs; the sun doth sparss abroad Its golden beams, the sea doth Rivers load With pearly streams; Christ is deffusive still, And freely to us give himself he will: Despair we might, should he slight our condition, And tell us we are not in his commission: To such sinners as we, he is not sent; But he is willing that we should repent And have him? thus his mind he doth declare, Come unto me, all ye that weary are, He fain would have the match made up between Us and him, was such freeness ever seen? The upright Christian hath a liberal heart To Christs poor, he loves always to impart To heal anothers wounds, the golden Balms Of mercy, he is ever giving alms: Mercy, and liberality always Is th'Ensign that integrity displayes: A good man is a common good, where e're He lives, to shew mercy he doth not spare: God-like he makes Charities springs to run Among poverties valleys, bad men shun Occasions to do good; he that alone Is good unto himself, is good to none. 234. On Communing. Men do commune with others at fit seasons, But ah! who is there with his own heart reasons. 235. On Communion. The Saints communion is with Christ their head In grace or glory, And with his Members either live or dead, Now glad, now sorry: A gracious heart with God communion hath By contemplation; By true desire, pure Love, adhering Faith; In conversation, Up towards God from whom all comforts roul; Grace bears the soul: In prayer we speak to God, in whom our bliss is, And God he kisses Us with the kisses of his lips, in the Sacrament, he Gives us a privy seal of his free grace, Doth us embrace. The spirits Load-stone draws the heart by love To God above. God is the center of the Soul, and where He is, tis there: A Christian as the Bird in the Nest, In God doth rest; God is our Father, Husband, Friend, Rock, Treasure, Good beyond measure: In him all fulness and all sweetness dwells, O he excells! My Soul to have with God sweet intercourse Thy self divource From sin, and from the love of worldly things, Whence no true comfort, nor contentment springs. 236. On Commutation. The Sts. traffick with God by pray'rs &amp; tears, For grace and glory, rich cælestial wares. 237. On Company. Children love to associate and be Together, precious is the company Of Saints, the Saints of Christ with flock together By companies; Birds of the self-same feather And so will sinners too, sinners will be, Brethren together in iniquity. The way to Hell hath still the greatest store Of passengers, both now and evermore? But better go the streight way single, then The broad with multitudes of wicked men. Number make not the thing good, but the weight Of truth, the pebbles of the world we slight As common; but the pearls of graces are Much prized by us, as exceeding rare: The vulgar streams will bring no vessel to The land of Peace, but few to Heaven go: The sinner with sad company shall dwell, The Devil and his Angels black as hell: Vain companie's the bate by which the Devil Is angling for our souls, shun such as evil: Keep company with them that fear the Lord; The Saints carry the Lanthorn of the word Along with them, sinners will cause our stay, O walk with them, but light us in our way; Let our delight be in them that excell In vertue, then with us it will be well. Four sweet Associates go with us in Our journey, Christ'ans undefil'd with sin, Good works, good Angels, our good Savior too, Who is the way, along with us doth goe, So that none can of loneliness complain, Who guarded are with such a glorious train, To Heav'nly Crowns &amp; Thrones; O blest convoy That safely brings us to the Courts of Joy. 238. On a Condition. Compare we our condition, and our Desert together, w'have deserved more Afflictions, and have deserved less Mercies from God, we cannot but confess. Compare we our estate with others such, As may cause wonder that we have so much: Compare we our estate with Christ upon The earth; compare we our condition With what it was, and shall hereafter be, So shall we not complain of poverty. We once lay in our blood, hell's heirs assign'd, We shall dye shortly, and leave all behind, If we have not what we desire, we have More then we brought, or carry to the grave. 239. On the Comparative Degree. Bad men are apt to say, some men are worse Then they, and therefore may expect a curse: Good men are apt to think, that such and such Are better then themselves, and praise them much. The worst of Christ is better then the best: Of the World, his afflictions end in rest All sinful pleasures fade, better be in, Hell with Christ Jesus, then in Heav'n with sin. 240. On Compassing. Er'e we get into Christ, we must come out Of sin, the next way home is round about. 241. On Compassion. Compassion doth as naturally flow From God our heav'nly Father us unto, As light does from the sun, his bowels yearn Towards his children, we must also learn To be as he is, merciful and mild To those that of their comforts are beguil'd. Christs Passion, nor his compassion Is ended; oh his Bowels! every grone Of the sick patient goes to the heart Of this Physitian; he doth impart His cord'al-promises to stay the soul From fainting, and does their estate condole In his relenting spirit, his love-streams in Poor souls, that find themselves heart-sick of sin: Though he will sinners wound and make them bleed, Yet will he never break the bruised Reed: Bonner, as one observ'd, was full of gutts, But ah! empty of bowels, God he shuts Not his compassion up, but does relieve Our pining wants, and grieve with them that grieve. 242. On Compensation. We shall be justifi'd according to Our works, but not for any good we do: God in Christ Jesus our good works regards, And through Christ Jesus we expect rewards: Faith in Christ Jesus help us to a Crown, All Popish Merits therefore we disown. 243. On Compitency. To have a competency, and to want Contentment, is an heavy punishment: Covetousness is a dry drunkenness, Perchance if one had more, he would have less Content; the more men have the more they still Desire, man's heart the world can never fill: He hath enough that is with his Estate Contented; learn we then to moderate, And lessen our desires; a little blest Is much, a competent estate is best: Did Esau say I have enough of store; And oh shall not a Saint say so much more! 244. On a Competitor. Saints are competitors for Heaven, that place Of bliss; Glory is for the heirs of grace. 245. On Complaining. A child of God complains of what he wants, He grieves he is so bad; from ordinance To ordinance, he goes for a supply Of his great wants, though he dares not deny The work of grace, yet he laments he hath No more grace, that he hath so little faith, So little love, so little zeal that's true, And that he can for God so little do. While some complain of poverty alas! My soul, do thou complain thou wantest grace. 246. On a Complement. We complement with God, if we profess We love him, yet delight in wickedness. 247. On Complexion. Christ he is white and ruddy in complexion, In him there is an excellent connexion Of purest colours, he is full of grace, Therefore the Virgin-heart doth him embrace. 248. On Complices. Sworn foes to vertue, and fast friends to vices, Sprung from th'infernal Den, are fit complices To further Satan's wicked enterprises. 249. On a Composition. Christ is a composition of all sweets, O blessed they whom he divinely greets! 250. On Comprising. God is immense beyond all bounds extended, And therefore can he not be comprehended. 251. On Compunction. All they that have received the Spirits Unction, First self conviction; after that, compunction. 252. On Computation. My sins to such a reck'ning do amount, That they surpass Arithmetick's account. 253. On Compulsion. Satan can but perswade, could he compell, Scarce one should go to Heav'n, but all to hell. 254. On a Comrade. He that in wickedness delights to trade, May fitly stiled be the Devils comrade. 255. On Concatenation. The grace of the spirit are like a Row Of orient Pearls, which hang together do Upon Religion's string, and serve to deck Christ's Bride, this is the Chain adorns her neck: Who hath one grace hath all, Gods spirit places An habit in the heart of all the graces, There is such a concatenation In them, that he who hath not all, hath none. 256. On Concealing. Who so conceals by sin, and wickedness Shall not be crown'd with prosperous success, But he that doth confess and sin forsake, Shall obtain mercy for Christ Jesus sake. 257. On Conceaving. Behold! in sin our mothers did conceave us, What is bred in the bone will hardly leave us. 258. On Conceiving. The Joys which God shal to his Saints impart, Out-vie the large conceptions of mans heart. 259. On Conceit. Many conceit they shall in Heaven dwell, Whose lives declare they are design'd for hell. 260. On a Concent. Angels and Saints are singing in one tune, Eternal praise to heavens great Trin-Une. 261. On Conclusion. Grace terminates in glory, the conclusion Of sin, is misery and sad confusion. 262. On the Concomitants of Faith. Consent is faith's concomitant, Christ whole Is inthron'd in a true believers Soul; The Soul consents t'have Christ, and him to have On his own terms, as well to rule, as save; The Saint consents t'have Christ for better or For worse, purely for love, ne're to part more, Resigning up all his self-interest, The best and purest of his love to Christ. Desire, is a concomitant of faith, Pants after Christ, the thirsty sinner saith, O who will give me to drink of that floud Of living water running in Christ's bloud! A contrite spir't is a concomitant Of faith, which the believers do not want; The spirit of grace, as dew makes the heart soft And tender, falling down upon it oft: The soul is even melted into tears, It weeps for love, no legal terror fears It as before, oh that against so sweet A Saviour I sin should once commit; He with a broken heart reflects upon A broken Christ, which suffered and hath done So much for him, thus woful Mary stood At Jesus feet, and wept a briny flood. 263. On Concord. The fairest flower of a Princes Crown, Is peace; to Church &amp; State peace brings renown. Peace is a girdle, that together tyes; Family-Members; O let's Concord prize. 264. On a Concourse. Few come to Sermons, how the means of grace Is lightly set by! but a multitude, As well the honourable as the base Convene, to see an idle Interlude. That which is practis'd by the most, is worst; And for the greater number is accurst. 265. On a Concubine. She is the Devils hackney, dearly hir'd To carry men to hell, with lust infir'd, Still us'd, and yet the Jade is never tir'd. 266. On Concupisence. My Soul avoid concupiscence, It is the Fountain head, from whence All our enormities do flow, And consequently endless woe. 267. On Condemnation. No condemnation is the share Of them, who in Christ Jesus are, Who never walk according to The flesh, but as the Spir't bids, do. 268. On Conditions. If we were our own carvers, we should cut The worst piece oftentimes: Lot being put To'his choice, Sodom was his choice desire Which was within a while consum'd with fire: The wise God sees the same condition Not fit for all, that which is good for one May be for others bad; one sort of weather Serves not all mens occasions altogether: This, needs Sun-shine; he, rain; by Gods wise power W'are plac'd in diff'rent Spheres, higher or lower; Prosperity is not so fit for all, Nor yet adversity, Honey nor Gall. Liberty is desired by the Saint, God will work his liberty by restraint; Many, through high-flown pride, are not content With what is given, or rather to them lent By the great God; but very few alas, Have learn'd Pauls lesson! he contented was In all estates, men are to that pass grown, They like any condition, but their own: One man commends this kind of life; a second Commendeth that, a country life is reckon'd By him the best; and he a City-life Highly applauds, this likes anothers wife Far better then his own, if men be poor, They learn to envy others that have store; If men are rich, their hand must then be greas'd, Much covets more, nor poor, nor rich are pleas'd Contentment as an Hony-comb, drops down Sweetness into ev'ry condition: There's no condition comes amiss to him That is content, let riches sink or swim, In the same posture he is always found, Knows as well how to want, as how t'abound: His Cross he doth not go to pick and choose, But always loves, to be at Gods dispose. Who hath a silver Crutch to lean upon Is pleas'd, but troubled when his Crutch is gon. God Checker-works his Providences white And black; the cloudy Pillar had its light, And dark-side too; mercies and miseries Are interwoven by a God most wise. Think what thou hast deserved at Gods hand, And discontent will easily disband: Thou hast deserv'd less mercies then are carv'd To thee, and more afflictions hast deserv'd: Some are in a for worse condition, who Perhaps deserv'd, far better then you do? Nay Christ himself, the Son and Heir of bliss, Was pleas'd to come in Forma pauperis: Nothing thou hast, but what thou soon maist lose, O be content to be at God's dispose. 269. On a Conduct. Our foes are strong to tear in sunder, We of our selves, weak to resist, Yet shall we conquer, sighting under The conduct of our Captain Christ: Sweet Jesus help me to subdue The World, and Sin, and Satan too. 270. On a Conduit. Christ is a conduit, Saints to him goe For living waters, which do from him flow. 271. On Confection. Sinners and Saints are here together mingled, But at the Judgment day, they shall be singled. 272. On Confederacy. The World, the Flesh, the Devil conspire our ill, And we must pray to God against them still. 273. On Conference. Some Plants will better bear neer other Trees, Then when they grow alone in godliness, The Saints thrives best, when they associate, And one another's Faith corroborate: When the Trees planted in Gods Orchard grow At too great distance, they less fruit do show. 274. On Confession. Sinfulness is asleep, confession A sign we are awak'd, or there is none; If our sins to our God we open lay, He will conceal them at the latest day: God will not cancel what man doth conceal, Confession heals; he that will not reveal His grief to his Physitian, hath no care Of his own cure, too many such there are. 275. On Confidence. Friends Venice-glasses are, use them we may, But if we lean to hard upon them, they Will break, but God for ever doth abide, My Soul! therefore in him alone confide. 276. On Confines. God who at once surveys the world's wide borders, All things for his own glory wisely orders; Lord sanctifie my heart, that I may not From the bounds of thy Law depart one jot. 277. On Confits. The sugred confits that the Devil Presents us with, are truly evil. 278. On a Conflict. We must contest against the Devils trial, By Faith; &amp; with our selves, by self-denial. 279. On Conformity. Rome roughly drives men to observe her Laws, But to conform to his, God mildly draws. 280. On Confusion. Confusion of sin must next ensue Confession, or Repentance is not true. 281. On Confutation. The Athiest that denies a deity, Shall when he comes to Hell confuted be. 282. On Congealing. The Sun of Right'ousness dissolveth in- To tears, hearts bound up with the frosts of sin 283. On Congestion. Let sons of Earth heap up their unsumm'd gold My God! O may my heart thy graces hold. 284. On a Congey. At Jesus Name each knee shall bow, Him service Men and Angels owe. But good Romanio tell me who, Commanded thee to congey so At Jesus Name, true Saints defie Syllabical Idolatry. 285. On Congratulation. The blessed Angels do congratulate The sinners freedom from his natural state. 286. On Congregation. That Congregation is not well taught, Whose Priest is either ignorant or naught. 287. On congruity. Sinners at league against the godly be, And shall not Saints among themselves agree! 288. On a Connie. The feeble Connie burroughs in the rock, A Saint in Christ can at all dangers mock. 289. On Conjecture. A man may guess and be deceiv'd, But what Truth says, must be believ'd. 290. On Conjoyning. From Christ the Saints receive their Unction, And they are One, O blest conjunction! Great and good, rich and holy are Happy, but yet conjunctions rare. 291. On a Conjurer. He that to do the Devils work engages, Shall certainly receive damnable wages; And such as to the Devils workman run For help, shall by so doing be undone. 292. On Connexion. God, Duty and Reward together ties, By sweetning his Commands with Promises. 293. On a Conquerour. Meekness is the best way to conquer Foes, And melt their hearts; by roughness, Peace we lose. It is the greatest conquest to o'rethrow An Enemy, and never strike a blow. Mildness prevaileth more than fierceness still. Where the wedge cannot go, the Fire will, The patient Soul even from his adversary Shall Letters testimonial have to carry. When bloudy Saul at Davids mercy lay And he cut off his skirt, and went away, How was Sauls heart affected! he doth cry To David, thou more holyer art than I. Thou hast not (when thou mightst) bath'd in my bloud Thy Sword, therefore the Lord reward thee good. Self conquerors are greater conquerors Than such as conquer mighty Forts and Towers. 294. On Conscience. The Conscience was ever, and is still The fountain of all actions, good or ill; And all the actings, whether foul or fair, Of men, are as their Consciences are. Conscience goes with us where e're we go, To bear record of whatsoe're we do. Conscience is Gods Vice-Roy in the Soul, And all are liable to its controul. Conscience is Christs Vicar in mans heart, It keeps Court there, and acts the Judges part. Its verdict can be by no pow'r repeal'd, Its stroaks are wounds that never can be heal'd: It's the Souls Anchor, boldness it maintains In judgment, and is of unwearied pains. Conscience is most like God, it is supreme, But under God this Jewel, O esteem For its great worth, as rarest next to Christ; It is our Patron, our Apologist; It is impartial, active, and sincere, Gods Register in us; his Harbinger For to prepare his way; this is beside Mans faithful Surety, Treasurer and Guide. The evidence of a good Conscience will Find with the judge of hearts acceptance still; Good Conscience is the only Ark that can Ding down the Dagons of all deeds prophane. A Conscience unstain'd with blushing crimes, Holds out in all changes of States and Times. Mount Sion and good Conscience abide For ever, and tentations can deride. A Conscience that is kept free from blame, Laughs at the false reports of long-tongu'd fame. Good Conscience will speak within, when all breath, The doors are shut to ev'ry vocal call. When riches, husband, wife, parents, friends, breath, Life, patience, firm hope, assured faith Have left us; a good Conscience is so fast A friend, that it sticks to us till the last. A right good Conscience term this we may, To live therein until our dying day. Good Conscience still keeps Holy-day, is bent To feasting ev'ry day; there is no Lent, No Fasting-days that interrupt this Feast, But still the chear is more and more encreas'd. Who keeps his Conscience from offences clear, That man keeps Hil'ry Term throughout the year But he that shipwracks a good Conscience shall Let in great riches, but the Devil withal. Good Conscience, as Davids Instrument, Drives away th'evil Spirit of discontent. Good Conscience can suck content divine, From bitt'rest drugs, turn Marah into Wine. Can sweetly smile, ev'n in afflictions sharp, This made Pauls Prisons-songs, tun'd Davids harp. It is a Paradise with pleasures fraught, All our best duties are without it naught. It's to the Castle of the Heart a Wall Of Brass: it is a Christians coat of Mail, How many do for want of it miscarry! It is a cordial Electuary: And very many good ingredients go Therein, Meat, Drink, Sleep, Ease, Refreshment too. Good Conscience on God it self can roul; 'Tis Aquavitæ to the swouning soul. A Conscience that from wickedness is pure, Can in the Cannons mouth repose secure. No such provision 'gainst an evil day, As a good Conscience; this is they say A constant Feast; who hath a Conscience good, Fares well although he have no other Food. A sincere heart will not do any thing 'Gainst Conscience, is bold in suffering; But ah! fearful of sin, such as upright would walk, must have God always in their sight. A Conscience that is pure and free from crimes Procures a peaceful calm in stormy Times. O if the ship of a good Conscience crack, How soon the Merchandize of Faith will wrack. There Conscience bears very little sway, If any, where coyn bringeth in his plea. Learning that is good, Conscience without Is but a ring of Gold in a Swines snout. Conscience, as the Bee, doth hony bring To good men, and to ill puts forth a sting. To Consciences dictates hearken to, And whatsoe're thou doubtest, never do. To keep thy Conscience pure, O spare no cost, All is lost, if the Conscience be lost; 'Tis true, I must confess the best reward That the World can good Conscience afford, Are stones and stroaks; if Paul will not resist His Conscience, then Ananias fist Shall be about his ears, but neither force Nor fraud, can from the Truth a Saint divorce. A wicked conscience loves a dark Cell; A desp'rate Conscience is a lesser hell: The wounded Conscience can find no rest But in Christ only, by true faith possest. Many woes by mans spir't sustained are; But oh, who can a wounded spirit bear! Though God will not damn those whom he loves well Yet he may in this life send them to Hell; A Conscience that is erroneous, is A Jack-a-Lantern leading men amiss. The Conscience of a sinner is defil'd, And hence no wonder if it be beguild: Sometimes the Conscience of a man is dumb, And as a silenc'd Preacher doth become; 'Twill not tell men of sin, a Conscience dead, Feels no sin; being so accustomed To sinning; he that hath an heart impure, May oft be safe, but ne're can be secure. Conscience hardned in some great sin, makes No stop in sin till ruine overtakes. Conscience as a Lyon slumber may, When it awakes, it roars and tears the prey, As Satan did the man which was possest; 'Tis like a Vulture gnawing at the Brest. It is Gods Bloud-hound that pursues a man, And will be at his heels, do what he can. 'Tis sad when it is either dumb or dead, Or by erroneous principles misled. The calm of Conscience will prove a storm One day; the guilty conscience is a worm, An ever-living worm, unapt to tire With biting, in the never-dying fire. Oh the weight! oh the load of the least sin, When Conscience doth to be awake begin! Consc'ence Gods Eccho is so shrill sometimes, And clamorous against enormous crimes, That sinners do not love to hear its noise, But silence it; the Mandrakes fatal voyce Is not so dreadful to the captiv'd ear, As that to sinners. Guilt ingenders fear: If maintain comfort in thy soul thou wilt, Preserve it from the obstructions of guilt, Which naturally breeds disquiet still; First Conscience is pure, then peaceable. Thou canst so long as thou hast peace with sin, Have no true peace of conscience within. 295. On Consecration. Jesus Christ was consecrated, To be our King, Priest, and Prophet; We are by him reinstated, Ransomed from Sin and Tophet. Come let us fall down before him, And with reverence adore him. 296. On Consent. Consent in will to what the judgment likes Facilitates an action: Paul thus speaks I consent to the Law that it is good, Rom. 7. 16. And therefore by him it was not withstood; A Saint consents to Gods commands, therefore They are not grievous; Sinners evermore Are under force, terrour of Conscience Hales them to duty, not its excellence; Such are like Slaves unto the Gally chain'd, That are (whether they will or no) constrain'd To work, but godly men like Subjects free, Yield to their Princes Laws; they love to be Forward in loyalty, and will confess Their equity and reasonableness. Saints find in Gods commands so much content, As draweth forth consent, and this consent Both easie and familiar made them hath, Consent is a concomitant of Faith; The Saint consents to have Christ, and to have Him upon his own terms to rule, to save. He makes it not his talk to pick and choose, But with whole Christ doth very freely close, For better or for worse; he sees there lies Beauty and glory in Christs opprobries. Purely for love, he loveth Christ for Christ; Without whom Heaven given by the High'st Is no sufficient dowry for a Saint, A Saint consents without the least constraint. Christs beauty and sweet disposition draws The Will to yield obedience to his Laws. The Will (which as the Master-wheel) doth carry The whole soul with it, as Sts. consents to marry With Christ (replenished with Graces store) On this condition, never to part more. He will part freely with his life, but not With Christ; indeed Death when it slips the knot Between the soul and body, it conjoyns The Soul and Christ more sure; a Saint resigns By way of Deed of Gift the interest That he hath in himself, wholly to Christ. His own name, his own will he yields to lose, And will be wholly at Christ's wise dispose. Christ hath the best and purest of his love, Which nothing shall be able to remove. That easie is which with consent is done, The March between Christ and the Soul goes on, With cheerfulness she giving her consent, Nor shall she e're have cause for to repent. Lord I assent, and give my consent to Thy sacred Laws: but ah! I cannot do What they command; yet wholly I resign My self to thee, O be thou wholly mine. 297. On Consequents. 1 Faith animates our duties and our graces; It is the vital Art'rie of the soul; Faith purifies the heart, and from it chases Nat'ral corruption, which makes it foul. Faith works out Pride, hypocrisie, self-love, And consecrates the heart to God above. 2 Faith is a grace that pacifies the heart, A gentle Dove that in its mouth doth bear The Olive-branch of Peace. Faith doth impart Strength to the Soul; by Faith we Victors are. Faith is a fruitful grace, good Works are seen As hand-maids still attending on this Queen. 3 Faith believes, as if it did Works resist, And worketh as if it did not believe. Faith is that Spouse-like grace which marries Christ, And good Works are the children w?? recieve Their birth from Faith; 'tis therefore no disgrace To good Works, to give Faith the highest place. 298. On Consideration. 1 Consideration is the root of all Noble designs, by her we attain to The end of all our hopes, when others fall; To hasty rash attempts, she is a foe. On thy ways much consideration spend, First what they are, and whether next they tend. 2 The Pilot on his compass still doth look, And by that means doth many dangers shun. The Merchant his affairs with his Count-book Adviseth, else he might be soon undone. Consideration is so necessary, That all estates without it will miscarry. 3 Gods Word &amp; Works doth furnish us with choice Of matter for to spend our thoughts upon; Yea ev'ry action (for they have a voice) Summons us to consideration. Be well acquainted with thy self and state, What thou art in thy self, O ruminate. 4 Th'art dust and ashes, within thee doth dwell Much wickedness; above thee thou mayst see A just offended God, below thee Hell; Against thee Sin and Satan; before thee Vain fancy-tickling pleasure, and behind Thee certain death; recall these things to mind. 5 Consider three things past; omitted good, Committed evil, and amitted time. Consider three things present; Lifes swift flood, Salvation work is hard, to Heav'n few climb. Consider three things; Future Death, Doom, Hell, And walk with God, so shalt thou with him dwell 299. On a Consistory. Coonscience is Gods Consistory, And his lesser Throne of Glory. 300. On Consolation. 1 Christ is call'd the consolation Of his people Israel, He that hath him hath Salvation, And shall ever with him dwell; By his Beams the Saints shall shine, And be as he is, Divine. 2 Christless souls are comfortless, Woful is their misery, How can such as these possess Comfort, when they come to die, They're in debt, no surety have, Sick, no Physitian to save. 3 All our comforts here below Are but weak, but such are strong Which do from the Spirit flow, And to Saints alone belong. Those are feculent, these pure; Those decay, but these endure. 301. On Consonants. Ask without Vowels, Consonants are dumb; So, without Graces, Men as Bruits become. 302. On a Consort. What consort's there when Consorts live in strife? O what a Jewel is a loving wife! O what a blessed harmony is there, When man and wife do serve the Lord with fear! 303. On Conspiracy. Sampsons Foxes were agreed To consume the Corn with fire; Satan and his cursed seed, Do against the Church conspire And her overthrow endeavour, But she shall abide for ever. 304. On a Constable. Constable mind your charge, the Drunkard reels About the streets, go lay him by the heels. Who sin corrects, he mercifully deals. 305. On Constancy. The Motto of a Christian should be that Of Queen Elizabeth, in ev'ry state Always the same, not lift up, by renown When lifted up; nor cast down, when cast down. A constant minded man is free from care, And sorrow-ending death he doth not fear, Aristides amidst the various fates And changes that befel th'Athenian States In his time, did always the same abide, For honour never puff'd him up with pride; Nor adverse things could ever make him vent The least of passion or discontent. He us'd to say, Good Citizens alone Rejoyce in what they have well said and done. Demosthenes, rather than he would prove A changeling, lost his life—We may not move Nor shrink one jot from our profession. Dan'el leaves not his God, though he be shewn The Lion; the three children still stood fast, When into the oft-heated Furnace cast. However like the lower Orb there's none, But have a nat'ral motion of our own, From good to ill; let's let the pow'r above us, The all-wise God, from ev'l to good to move us, Who ever is the same; we must endeavour To be like him, so shall we live for ever. Better it were never to have begun, Than not continue till the race be run. Vain is alas, the running of that soul, Who faints before he cometh to the Goal. Not to go forward in Gods way, is to Go backward; many begin well, but few End so; it tendeth to perfection To consummate what we have well begun; Lifes crown is given to such as persevere, As good never a whit, as ne're the near. 306. On Constellation. 'Tis not the influx of a Constellation, But sin that bringeth ruine to a Nation. 307. On Constitution. Some men of such a constitution are, That for their sins they cannot shed a tear: But let no Saint be thereat discontent The Vessel may be full, though it wants vent. 308. On Constraint. Sinners compell'd do yield, the gracious Saint Obeys God out of love, not by constraint. 309. On Construction. Without addition or deduction, Things may admit a good Construction. 310. On a Consul. Romes Consuls honourable things did do, God grant our Counsellours may do so too. 311. On Consultation. When we would get what really is good, We must not take advice from flesh and blood. 312. On a Consumption. A man may have his body plump and whole, Yet a Consumptive, a diseased soul. 313. On Consummation. As Glory is the consummation Of Grace, so Grace is Glory here begun. 314. On Contact. The Loadstone by a vertual contact Draws Ir'n to it. Gods Spir't doth attract Us by a supernat'ral instinct T'himself, to Christ by faith our hearts are link't 315. On Contagion. Sin infects all the powers of the soul, And members of the body; puts the whole Man out of order: if Christ bathe us in His blood, that frees us from the plague of sin. 316. On Containing. God is immense in ev'ry place remaining, Contain'd of nothing, yet all things containing 317. On Contemplation. Felicity, the Stagarite assign'd To the high contemplation of the mind; By contemplation the Souls pow'rs are prest To act upon (this most perfect object) Rest: The Nursery of Piety it is, St. Herom stiled it his Paradise; It's a friend to the Graces, contemplation Helps very much to water the Plantation: A Treasury it is, where all the Graces Are locked up, this a Prospective-Glass is, By which the Saints see things not to be seen By mortal eyes; this Portal lets us in To glory, and puts us in heav'n before Our times, King Davids thought were evermore, Travelling towards the Jerusalem Above, which made him things below contemn: A devout Soul in contemplation, Is never loss alone; then when alone By good desires, in the best company, Even with his God and Saints it loves to be. 318. On Contempt. The world with all it's pleasures, profits, glory, Is transitory: And it gives no content to them that prize it, Let's then despise it; And use it so, as though we us'd it not; Envy doth blot Fair honours credit, swelling Titles are Dreams in career: Riches have wings, but for a while they stay, Then flee away, Pleasures alas! how quickly do they fade When grief invade! My Soul, there's nothing that deserves thy love But God above: O run to him, and strive to be possest Of him, so shalt thou be for ever blest. 319. On Contending for Heaven. And does there then remain a glorious Rest For Saints? O let us zealously contest For it against all oppositions, We must pass thorough Thornes to sit on Thrones, We er'e we reign, three Regiments must rout, The flesh, and Devil within, the world without. By giving battel to them in the way, Heav'n is for triumph, but it's now a day Of battail, let's fight the good fight of Faith, There's no cessation of Arms till death. 320. On Contention. Contention springs from pride, &amp; it makes way For trouble; Wild-fire like it will not stay, But runs and leaps so furiously about, That nothing else, but bloud can quench it out. Tis woful dwelling with debateful men, Whose Soul hate peace, nurs'd in Erynays Den; Our Pettyfoggers Satans fire-brands, Do more hurt to the Commons of the Land, Then Sampsons Foxes with fire-brands ty'd to Their tail, to the Philistians corn could do. Contention hinders much the growth of grace, He who is in the Gall of bitterness, Cannot parturiat, no nor inherit The pleasing fruits of the peace-loving spirit, A froward heart is like to Pathmos Isle, No Herb of grace will grow upon that soil, Can good seed sprout and flourish in a ground, Where Thorns and Briars do so much abound? Till strife be by some Antidote expell'd, The choicest food no nutriment can yield. 321. On Contentment. The fire Flies to the sphere, the Rivers roul To th'Sea, the Load-stone turneth to his Pole: The stone hasts to its center; even so The heart should long to be vnited to Its God in love; nothing there is that can Yield satisfaction to the wit of man; But the first Truth; goodness alone can fill The hearts desire, and content the will, And this is God, what are all other things, But like the Butter-flies fine painted wings, Which yet pollute our fingers? can there be Fulness in emptiness and vanity: Riches have wings, and Honour is but vain, And worldly pleasure often ends in pain: Content without the world, is better then The world without content to sober men, To have a handsome competent estate, And no contentment, is a judgment great; Competency with contentment is far More eligible, then great Lordships are, Content becalm's the mind, and banishes Repining thoughts out of its Diocess: Comfort flows from content, he's always poor That hath abundance, and yet wanteth more. He is the wealthiest man that is content With what he hath, for riches are but lent: Contentment is a flow'r not to be found In ev'ry Garden, how we may abound In midst of want, by this we tutor'd are; 'Tis griefs Pan-pharmacon, the cure of care: This in a deluge makes us even to sing; O 'tis an heav'nly and intrinsick thing! Content, for service fits, and tunes the heart, To the wheels of the Soul doth oyl impart, It carries Heaven about it, where it goes, For what is Heaven, but the sweet repose Souls have in God? contented spirits are Like Heaven, for God is there, and rest is there: What-ever in the Creature wanting is, Is made up in contentment: O the bliss Of a contented mind! God that doth feed The Ravens, will not suffer his to need. Godless men have enough, yet more do crave, Godly men are content with what they have, And that is their enough; where is no grace, There can be no content in any case: How many men in this terrestrial round Loose by desire, but by content are crown'd! Contentment is a golden Shield that saves The Soul; 'tis like a rock that breaks the waves, It is an Antidote that doth expell Sin, and temptations rising out of Hell, Contentment is the true Philos'phers-stone, Which turns all into Gold; content alone Doth sweeten all estates, this little is A pledge of more; blessed be God for this! It makes a fair interpretation Of all Gods dealings, 'tis in goodness done: A Christian has that which may make him Content, unless his spir't'al eyes be dim: Hath not God giv'n thee Christ? Treasure divine Are in him, is not he a golden Mine Of grace and wisdom? hast thou not the spirit? And dost not thou the promises inherit? Hast thou not a reversion of Heaven, And canst thou be of full content bereaven? We pray thy will be done; now then we do Confute our pray'rs, if discontent we show: It is the will of God and his decree, That we should in such a condition be; God sees it best for us; content subdues Our selves, and holy valour doth infuse. It doth God's glory mightily advance, And dash the Devil out of countenance. All cross or bloudy providences shall Doe a Believer good, we know that all Things (good or evil) work together do For their good, that love God; if so, O who Will murmur or repine! let's be content, God hath the ord'ring of each grand event: Our life's a day, if God our charges bear, Till death's night come, for more we need not care. Prosperity hath still in it more trouble, More danger, and it's reckoning is double: The sorrow here we meet with, shall not last, Our hell, when we have shot Deaths gulfe, is past: O what a dreadful judgment is assign'd, To them that have not a contented mind! This lesson of content (as I may say) Is the best lesson that a Saint can play, God likes this Musick well: All are concern'd To learn this lesson, which St. Paul once learn'd: Which way soever providence did blow, Paul how to steer his course had skill to know: With what God sends, let us contented rest, A little is enough, if truly blest. Heaven is our home, who hath enough to bear His charges thither, for more need not care; Yet content in a nat'ral state (alas!) We may not be; nor with a little grace; God but to some doth true content impart; Few Commence Masters of this sacred Art. He that hath learnt Pauls lesson of content; Is silent, chearful, thankful, hath no bent To run on sin to free himself from woe; Nor will he venture out till God bids goe: God will give grace and glory to his own; Here is enough for faith to live upon: He that knows God is his, and all that is In God is for his good, takes naught amiss: They only possess all things, that possess The possessor of all things; nothing less Then God can fill us, here is nothing can Yield true contentment to the soul of man: Contentment will the Super-structure be, Where the Foundation is Humility, Good Consc'ence, Self-denial, Meditation On Heav'n, and Prayer foment contentation: Grace is (when all things fail) sufficient, Lord grant me that, and I will be content. 322. On Continence. Venus will freeze, if Ceres (belly-cheere) And Bacchus (wine) make not a fire for her; Prayer and Fasting is the Agnus castus, And Lettice to cool lust, which else may wast us! Sine Cerere &amp; Baccho friget Venus. 323. On Continuance. The end crowns all, as we have well begun, We must go forward to perfection, At this mark aim, and shoot, though it we miss; Constancy wins the Garland; nothing is Said to be done, while any part remain To do, none can for Heav'n take too much pain. Thou hast done well, yet go on still, hold fast, See thou be always good, but best at last. The tir'd Horse when he comes neer home will mend His pace, so thou when neer thy journeys end: Alas! how many are there set about The work, but work not their salvation out? Some Jehu like have in Religion Furiously drived, but their wheels anon Have been took off; we live in the Leafs fall, Some that seem'd best, have proved worst of all: Glorious professors in their march to Heaven, Have tir'd, to such the Crown shall not be given: Pray'r, hearing, holy conference (alas!) Is left by such as once made shew of grace: He doth unravel all he did before, Who in the middle of the work, gives o're, Postates are the richest spoyles of all, That Satan gives away with this black Hall. O you that never yet took one stitch in The work of your salvation, now begin; Reirgion is (if it be follow'd well) A thriving trade, O strive therein t'excell; Such only as do labour very hard In their Soul-Vinyards, meet with a reward. He that unto the death is faithful found, Shall with a lasting Diadem be crown'd: Tis better not to have the race begun, Then to give over e're the prize be won. Some have I seen who for their sins have mourn'd, But ah their Spring is into Autumn turn'd; They have lest oft working for Heav'n at last, And like fair mornings, been soon over-cast, Have fall'n to sin; O I would have such read That thundering Scripture, for it had indeed Been better for them never to have known The way of Right'ousness, than to disown It afterwards; he that runs half the race And then faints, looseth the reward of Grace. 324. On a Contract. There is a contract past between Christ and the Soul that hateth sin, The Soul that takes delight in evil, Hath chosen for her mate the Devil. 325. On Contradiction. He contradicts his Pray'rs that says thy will Be done, and always doth his own fulfill; If thou repent, and not reformest, this Repentance with a contradiction is, God will forgive, but thou to Hell shalt go, Forgiveness with a contradiction too! Heaven is with joys &amp; hell with torments stock'd, Be not deceived, God will not be mock'd. 326. On Contraries. Contraries are as Commentaries to Destroy each other, if oppose we do Contrary natures diametrally, We learn what to embrace, what to pass by, If the departing sun should not leave night To follow it, the day would seem less bright. The foil adds grace to th'Jewel, ignorance Barking at learning, doth its worth advance, He knows the worth of heat (I dare be bold) Who felt the sharpness of a freezing cold, Even health it self, did but no sickness vex, Would be thought sickness, and as much perplex; Nay, foul sin by a sober Meditation, Affordeth an unwilling Illustration To grace (which doth our souls so beautifie) 'Gainst which it vaunts a contrariety. 327. On Contribution. I read the Ancients made oyl to be The sacred embleme of true Charity; The golden oyl of contribution, Like A'rons oyl, must trickle down upon The poor, which are the garments lower skirts, The Saints to pious uses wealth converts: Not only Christ (in whom all fulness dwells) Commands to do good works, but grace compells. 328. On Contrition. Contrition, in all true Converts found, Is the up-breaking of the fallow ground; The renting, or the pricking of the heart For sin, a sensibility of smart: It's the way to conversion from sins; Conversion with contrition begins, Contrition imports an inward sorrow, Sincerity, which hath no need to borrow A feigned Art; true faith, with strong desire Of mercy, though we have deserv'd hell-fire. Let's mourn for sin, mourning will now do well, Who mourns not here on earth, shall mourn in hell, Obdurate Souls shall have eternal shame, God will renounce whom he could not reclaime; But he will not a contrite heart despise, O 'tis his acceptable Sacrifice. Mirth more than mourning pleaseth Kings on earth, God more delights in mourning than in mirth: The Spir't of grace dropping as dew upon The heart, makes it a soft and tender one: God poureth forth his spirit on his Saints, Which makes them mourn, and pour forth sad complaints, Sayes the poor sinner, Oh that I should spurn Against such bowels, and for this doth mourn: He washeth with his tears Christ's wounds, before He wept for fear, now he for love weeps more. What folly is it not to mourn? how shall God bottle up our tears, which never fall? Or how shall he wipe those tears from our eyes, Which never trickled thence, with fresh supplies On our moist cheeks? Or shall he comforts give To us, that do not mourn, that will not grieve? God makes us wise that we may choose the best, To mourn now with Gods servants, and be blest With them; blessed are they that tears do shed, For they shall be hereafter comforted. 329. On a Controller. God is the great controller of our Souls, Whose Byas naturally hell-ward rouls. 330. On Controversie. In fundamental Truths be resolute And stable, he that falshoods would confute, Makes these his fixed Poles, whil'st Scepticks tost On controversial seas, are giddi'd, lost. 332. On Contumacy. Self-will'd we are by nature, if God please He can pul down our stubborn hearts with ease And make the Mountain of our pride decrease. 332. On a Conventicle. Where men do meet to serve the Lord with fear For holy ends, no Conventicle's there. When men (like Venners party) meet and stickle T'effect some ill, O that's a Conventicle. 333. On Conversation. Where there is a good conscience, there will Be a good conversation, pure hearts still Go with pure lives, when with its golden beams Grace shines abroad, how beautiful it seems! If the stream be corrupt, we may suspect The Spring to be impure, a Saint will act For God, of God he very often talks, And with God, Noah-like, he always walks, Is exercis'd in Angels work, always Serving his God, and singing to his praise: A Christian is full of spir't'al mirth, His life's a very Heaven upon Earth; The conversation of Saints is where God is, in Heaven e're themselves come there, Shall we account them pure, whose conversation Is not in Heaven, Gods Holy habitation; But in hell rather, Satans dwelling place? How justly may such as are voyd of grace, Reproach and scorn Religion when they see't Thus kicked down, with our unholy feet. The Clock hath not its motion within Alone, without there moves the Dyal-pin: Sincerity of heart is seen upon The Dyal of the conversation. A pure heart hath a golden Frontispice, It loves fair vertue, and abhors foul vice, Grace like new wine, will have vent, cannot be Concealed, the fruits do manifest the Tree, Although within Religions main work lies, Yet must our light shine forth to others eyes, The Saints are called Jewels in the sight Of others, they reflect a lustre bright, When we have Gospel-conversations, We in Gods Church, are sparkling Diamonds. Saints lives come near to Christ their all in all, As the Transcript to the Original. Christ in his conversation, lovely seems, His life was purer than the sunny beams; 'Twas a fair copy never any one, Wrote without blotting, saving Christ alone, Who knew no sin; his lips never did speak A word amiss, his feet did never tread A step awry, and he who was a way For others to walk in, did never stray Out of the way himself, his life's throughout, A pattern of good works, he went about Still doing good even from the cratch unto The Cross, he never any ill did do. As Moses face did shine when he had bin With God, so we in holiness must shine. Our carri'ge and deportment should declare, That of Heavens City, Burgesses we are. And that we to Jerusalem above Are going, thorough the high-way of Love. Sincer'ty in the heart as holy leaven, Makes the heart to swell, &amp; rise as high as Heaven. The upright man orders his conversation Aright, and God will shew him his salvation. Some brag they have good hearts, but their lives are Crooked, they hope to go to heaven, but their Foot-steps take hold of Hell, while Saints set on Religions head an honourable Crown, Adorn the Gospel; such shall reign no doubt, Who copy in their lives the Bible out. 334. On Converse. 1 We cannot here converse with this unclean And dirty World, but some uncleanness will, Fasten upon us, godly men have been Desirous to converse with better still Than themselves are, this doth characterize A gracious heart, he good converse doth prize. 2 Lovers desire before the marriage day To chat together oft, Christ by his Spirit Converseth with the Soul, and the Soul may Converse with him by prayer, and through his merit, Obtain good things, Ordinances divine Are to a Christian, the house of Wine. 3 O these the Chariots of salvation are, Christ rides herein, into believers hearts, The Ordinances are the Lattice where Christ looketh forth, and to his Saints imparts His smiling Face, Word, Prayer, Sacraments, Furnish the Soul with holy conference. 335. On Conversion. Gonversion is a change of mind, heart, will, And life, to what is good from what is ill: Conversion of a sinner by degrees; And painfully is wrought, as God doth please, Tis not the word that man speaks, nor the man That speaks to us the word of truth, which can Convert a soul; conversion is wrought By knowing things, the spirit hath us taught Otherwise than before, truth is alone The truest Touch-stone of conversation, A moral, formal mental, temporary, Conversion many have, and yet miscarry: Rich mens conversion is hard and rare, A sound conversion is whole, sincere, Growing in grace, constant in holiness, Its worth no tongue is able to express. If one return that unto God belongs, The blessed Angels welcome him with Songs, The Devils follow him with furious cry, His old Colleagues, with scorn and obloquy, Aversion from sin, conversion To God, makes way for an eternal Crown. 'Tis not enough not to commit foul crimes, But we must practice good, and this betimes. (Timothy-like) if fruit we forth will bring In Autumn, we must blossom in the Spring. 336. On Conviction. Conviction of sin is the first act Of Christs, wrought in Believers Gods elect There can be no Faith without sense of sin, And of the misery that we are in: And there can be no sense of sin indeed, Unless a real sight of sin precede; Which the Law shews, the main end of the Law Is to drive us to Christ, (Free-grace must draw) Men may know sin, not be convinc'd at all, There's a conviction meerly rational, There is in that conviction which is right, A clear, a real, and a constant light: When by this light, let by the Spirit into The soul, we see sin, death, there's now a through Conviction: O the evils that await Upon an Unregenerate estate! So much conviction as may bring in, And work in us compunction for sin: So much is necessary and no more, A sound conviction always goes before Sincere conversion; there are no doubt Many convictions for sin without Conversion, but no conversion Without convictions; 'tis the Spirit alone That must convince (as Christ did once express) The world of sin, and also right'ousness. Conviction is Gods preparatory To Faith, and so to everlasting Glory. The seed that wanted depth of earth decay'd, Faith that is not in deep conviction laid, Will wither soon, and be for nothing meet, Till sin is bitter, Christ is never sweet. Christ calls 'tis true, but he gives ease to none, But them that do under sins burden groan. A man must see himself lost and undone, Before to Christ he can for comfort run. When once the soul convinced is of Sin, And the Hell at his heels, it doth begin To prize a Saviour, when convictions dart, Is by the Spirit whirled in the heart, It panteth after Christ, begs hard for grace; And O how willing is it to imbrace Christ upon his own terms! it's free to have Christ for to rule, as well as Christ to save. Let God propound what Articles he please, The humble soul subscribes to them with ease. When one is brought to Christs terms, to believe And obey, then is he fit to receive The streams of mercy, when Gods Spir't hath been A Spirit of Conviction, it then Becomes a Spirit of consolation: When the Plough of the Law hath gone upon The heart, and broken up the fallow ground, Now God (whose love doth evermore abound) Doth sow the seed of comfort; such as boast Of comfort, ah! but by the holy Ghost Were never yet convinc'd, find in conclusion Their comfort a Satannical delusion. 337. On Convocation. There shall be a Convocation Of all Saints at the great day, To be crown'd with Salvation, And to reign with Christ for ay. In the New Jerusalem O may I be one of them 338. On Convulsions. What strange convulsions Reprobates in hell Endure for ever, O what tongue can tell! 339. On a Convoy. My soul is under sail, Lord, if thou be My convoy, I the Port of peace shall see. 340. On a Cook. The Saints are ghests, and Glory is their dish, A better Cook than Grace I would not wish. 341. On a Coop. Hell is the Devils Coop Sinners run in, But never can find the way out agin. 342. On a Co-partner. If of Christs grace participate we do, We shall share with him in his glory too. 343. On a Cope. The Cope and Vestments of as much renown, Will b' out of season, when the Pope goes down. 344. On a Copy. Christs love was holy, hearty, kind, and stable, And we should follow him as we are able. 345. On a Copy-hold. Heav'n is a Christians Copy-hold more sure Than any, for it ever shall endure. 346. On a Copiss. Sinners shall Copiss-like be hewen down. With Gods just Ax, and into Hell fire thrown. 347. On Copper. Such are but Copper Christ'ans, who profess That they know Christ, yet live in wickedness. 348. On Copperas. Sin is as poys'nous as the Copperas; No Antidote can drive it out, but Grace. 349. On Copulation. God first of one made two, and now ties two In one, which knot Death only can undo. 350. On Coral. We rub therewith Teeth-breeding Infants Great ben'fit often from hard usage comes. 351. On a Cord. Love is a cord binds us to Christ, and draws Our hearts to yield obedience to his Laws. 352. On a Cordial. Gods Word is a strong cordial to the Saint, This comforts him, when he is like to faint; In wants and woes it yields support divine; Turns Marah waters into pleasant wine. Let sickness come, the comforts of the Word Can allay it, and saving health afford; The fiery trial, this is that opposes, And turns the flame into a bed of Roses. The sense of pardon takes away the sense Of pain. Suppose Death come to fetch us hence, A Christian can out-brave it, O Death where Is thy sting! by the Word the spirits are Reviv'd and chear'd; thus ev'ry child of God Tastes honey at the end of the tart rod. It's good t'have such a Julip lying by, As can expel Deaths venom, when we die. 353. On a Core. We must take out the core of malice from Our hearts, before we to Gods Table come 354. On Cork. Hope is the Cork that makes a Saint to swim Above the floods, which else would ruine him 355. On a Cormorant. Hell is a Cormorant, devouring all The souls, that into Satans clutche; fall. 356. On Corn. Good Works are crown'd, the husbandman takes pain Before he reaps the pride of Ceres Plain. 357. On a Corner. Each dusty corner of the heart must be Swept clean, to entertain the Trinity. 358. On a Corner-stone. Christ is resembled to a Corner stone; The whole weight of the Fabrick lies upon The Corner-stone, the weight of our salvation Lies upon Christ, Christ is our sustentation. Christ is the real Atlas, his firm shoulders Are of the Churches weight, the main upholders. He is that golden Pillar bears up all Th'Elect, and while he stands, they cannot fall. The Corner-stone ev'n as a Medium doth Firmly unite, and link together both Parts of the building; so when God and man At variance were, this Corner-stone again United them, yea did cement them too, With his own bloud, and more what could he do? The Corner-stone is that which gives alway Direction to the Builders, how to lay And place all other stones; he in his sight Must have the Corner-stone, who would build right. Christ Jesus is a Saints direction, And rule, in all things by him to be done. And have an eye, continually we must Upon his word, and his example just. The fairest stones because of beauty, are Plac'd in the Corner, Christ is very fair, The beauty of the spir'tual Mansion: How rarely lovely is the precious Stone! Christ who sustains, unites, adorns, directs, Excells all Corner-stones in five respects. He is a living Stone, and for his praise, He unto the whole Building, Life conveys, Hence Saints for spiritual buildings fit, Are stiled Living Stones in sacred Writ. He is a Stone of Gods immediate laying; He is a Corner-stone without decaying. As fast now, as he did at first, he cleaves; He from the other stones no strength receives, Christ is a Corner-stone that reaches from The bottom to the top; all good things come From him alone: One Christ the need supplies, Of the whole Church, which on his grace relies Note hence, the Church is firm, fair, with Christ one, The Pope is not the Churches Cornerstone. The truth of Christs two Nature; Christ is strong And very near to those to him belong. Lean not on sandy pillars, Christ is able To prop thee, cast thy care on him; be stable, Be comforted, Christ is the Corner-stone Of Grace, as well as of Salvation. He's strong though you be weak; recal to mind The Corner-stone when you Church-tottrings find Christ is a Stone elect, he is likewise A precious Stone in Gods, Saints, Angels eyes: And in himself, his person, and his graces, Are glorious, so the Church for such a Basis. Christ by the most of men despised is, Because of ignorance, pride, prejudice. In largeness and duration Christ excells All other precious Stones, all fulness dwells In him, no noble qualities he wants, O the great riches of Believing Saints! O bless God for this precious Corner-stone, Encourag'd be to build on him alone: Prize what refers to Christ, esteem him more Than all the Jewels on the Indian shore: So will you stick faster to him, and do, And suffer gladly what he calls you to. 359. On a Cornet. The Cornet was esteem'd in elder days, David would have it us'd to sound Gods praise Now let us with our hearts our voices raise. 360. On a Colonel. The Colonel commandeth armed Bands, How blest is he, who his own self commands! 361. On Coronation. At Death a Christian shall compleatly be Install'd into his honour, he shall see God face to face, on him shall oyl be spread, And the Crown-Royal set upon his head. Saints of the Kingdom now are heirs renown'd, Doth not the heir desire to be crown'd? And, oh, shall not the Saints, while here they stay, Be longing for the Coronation-day! 362. On a Corporation. Christ is the head-officer, th'heirs of salvation Are members of a blessed Corporation. 363. On a Corps. Till God infuse grace into us, we can Nor feel, nor act, no more than a dead man. 364. On Correction. It's no small mercy in a Father to Correct his child when he amiss doth do. We have as much need of corrections As Ordinances; God corrects his sons Whom he affects, he doth in love reprove, Correction is an argument of love. This shews our son-ship, for our heinous crimes, We must be under the Black Rod sometimes. Correction is a School, the Saints therein Learn best, God hath but one son without sin, But no son without stripes; if stripes we have, Know we God smites in love, that he may save. Corrections are Gods corrosives to eat The proud flesh out, the Stockfish being beat Boils soonest, gold is not the worse for trying, Nor corn for being fann'd; when sin is dying Grace lives, some plants grow better in the shade Than in the Sun; so we when griefs invade. The snuffing of the candle makes it burn The brighter, when our edge begins to turn, God whets it; when the Thorn is at the brest, The Saint, God's spir't'al Nightingale, sings best. God is fain to rub hard, we are so stain'd, For to fetch out the dirt in us ingrain'd. Some Birds will hatch but in time of Thunder, Saints are best when correction keeps them under. Before affliction David went astray, But by affliction David learnt t'obey. 365. On a Corrival. The Souls a Virgin, Christ and Satan wo her, Christ to enrich her, Satan to undo her. 366. On a Corrasive. The Law must first corrode, and search the wound, Before the Gospels balm can make it sound. 367. On Corruption. Hyblæan Hony is commixt with Wax: The finest linnen hath both stains and bracks. Gold hath its dross, and on the self-same ground, Bright wheat, and also cumbrous weeds is found. Ev'n so corruption in the Church of Christ, May stand, and yet with it true Grace consist: In Heav'n there's none but good, there's none in hell But bad; both bad &amp; good on earth do dwell. The Church is Heaven's Kingdom call'd, because Heav'ns King rules it by his Cœlestial Laws. Yet still it is but Heaven upon Earth, Whilst militant, some failings will sprout forth; Nor may we therefore separate, for sure The Gospel's fair, though mens lives are impure. Gods floor hath chaff with corn, his drag-net hath Rubbish with fish, his house vessels of wrath With those of honor; the Moon sometimes wains, And when 'tis at the Full, it hath some stains. To the prepared it is not exprest, My friend, how came you in with such a ghest. Corruption, succedaneous to the fall Of the first man, is that Original Iniquity which Adam by the act Of his so foul transgression, did contract, And transmit to posterity, this is Th'effect of that which Adam did amiss. Corruption reigns not, though it may abide In Saints, God looks it should be mortifi'd; And he, if in the main we be upright, Will pass them by, and very much delight In all our duties, though remain they do, Yea them reward here, and hereafter too. And now my soul be careful to discover Thy special vile affections; O watch over Sins of thy calling, nature, constitution, Time, place, and with a constant resolution Strive to subdue them, by thy prayers wrastle, And give not o're till thou hast won the Castle 370. On Cosmographie. Tis said the World is spherical and round, And that's the reason why there can be found Little square dealing, roundness signifies Perfection, yet below but little lies. 371. On Cost. Our Saviours precious bloud was spilt, To satisfie for all our guilt, He did bleed out at ev'ry vein Our pardon, by his loss we gain. 372. On a Costardmonger. The Costardmonger sels Pears, Apples, Plums Satan puts off his wares to all that comes. 273. On a Costrel. This Vessel's full of Liquor, but alas! My heart is empty of the wine of Grace. 374. On a Cottage. The body is a Cottage, and it must Resign it's Tenant, then return to dust. 375. On Cotton. Our spungie eares are apt to drink Foul language, as the Cotton Ink. 376. On a Couch. King Davids Couch was watered With tears, which for his sins he shed. And O that I for sin could weep, And my poor heart in sorrow steep! 377. On the Covenant. Do this and thou shalt live, the covenant old Urg'd this, but this afforded comfort cold. But the new says, Believe and live for ever, Accepting for the deed, our best endeavour. The Law commandment gives, but not converts; The Gospel brings salvation to our hearts, And our hearts to salvation; each Saint Because he is with God in covenant Is blest already; I their God will be, And they shall be a People unto me. Happy that people, whose God is the Lord! This is the crowning blessing, O sweet word! To have God to be ours, to be possest Of God, cannot but make us fully blest. No tongue can tell thy blessedness, who art In Christ, and in his Covenant hast part. Mans fall did prove within a little space, An in-let to the covenant of grace. The Covenants Tie is Sure, for all do grant, Christ is the Suretie of the covenant. They are the Favourites of Heaven, who are Link'd to, and under Gods indulgent care. Such only as are undefil'd with sin, And pure in heart, are interessed in The covenant of Grace, we have no right To the new covenant till washed white. God he hath made his Will, and will not fail To settle Heaven, upon us by entail. With this Proviso in the Will, that we Be purifi'd, and holy persons be. The covenant is our great charter, this Entitles us to ev'ry thing that is In Earth and Heaven, the Saint in wealth excels, By having Christ, in whom all fulness dwells. Christ is the hinge and pillar, upon which The covenant of Grace (which makes us rich In all things) turns; 'tis founded upon Christ, And sealed in his blood, an interest We have in Christ, by faith, this golden chain, Present and future things by faith we gain. The covenant is a golden Zone or clasp, That God to us, and us to God doth hasp. In elder times the girdle was a token Of chastity; the covenant once broken, The Church doth lose her pure virginity, Israel Gods Spouse fell to Idolatry: A sin that did directly cut in sunder Th'afed'ral knot, that she's divorc'd what wonder? Our solemn Obligations are of late, As an old Almanack gone out of date: But covenant violation is an high Affronting sin, which God will not pass by Without revenge, a bold affront will make God draw his sword, and vengeance on us take. O if God's covenant so sacred still, Will not restrain us, God hath chains that will; Eternal chains: Have we not cause to mourn, When Christians do Carthaginians turn, And make no reck'ning of their Oaths at all? Unless we do repent, perish we shall. Mourn England, mourn for covenant violation. Which is a flying roll against thy Nation. The Sacramental covenants, thy vow In Baptism, and at the Lords Supper, thou Hast started from, and hast done nothing less Than what thou promisedst in thy distress. How shamefully hast thou thy God forgot? And made his covenants like a Gypsies knot, Fast or loose at thy pleasure; or reform Thy ways and labour to prevent a Storm Of falling vengeance; O repent betimes, And God will pardon thy Heav'n-daring crimes. 378. On Covering. The wings of mercy hover over A Saint, his sins free grace doth cover, Who of Christ Jesus is a lover. 379. On Covetousness. Covetise of all evils is the root, Hence discontent and other mischiefs sprout; Theft, Treason, Murder, wilful Perjury, Fraud, Brib'ry, Whoredom, foul Idolatry. Horrid oppression, quarrelsome debates, And the subversion of mighty States. O what a cursed sin base avarice is, In that it is the parent of all vices. Lord, what a monster 'tis! who would not fly it? Mans body it deprives of restful quiet, Of peace his conscience, his soul of grace, And leaves him in a miserable case. Since then th'effects of coveting is such, Better it were to want, than have too much. How sad is it to have a Sea of sin, And not a drop of mercy enter in The heart! the reason why the word avails No more, is avarice, the seed oft falls Among rough thorns; the sprouting thorns (we read) Choaked the good disseminated seed Thousands of Sermons buried lye (alas!) In earthly hearts, hearts that this world embrace. Covetize always is sparing in giving, But how excessive is it in receiving! Gold guides the Globe of earth, and covetize Runs round about the world; they riches prize, Who careful are to get, desirous to Keep riches, and are loth to let them goe: Gain is indifferent in it self still, The use is good, but the abuse is ill, The care is worse, the conquest vile and base, The gain of Gold make many men (alas!) To lose their Souls, by being over-saving, Thousands are lost, yet there's no end of having. What men get, like the Polypus they hold, Some study the black Art for yellow Gold; Desire of gain scarce ever yet did good, This hath made some swim to the crown in blood, What numbers hath it caus'd Physitians to Destroy? what numbers Lawyers to undo: It hath not only multitudes undone, But it is beneficial to none. Covetous men while they themselves enrich, Debase themselves, making themselves a pitch Low'r than their Angels, as God made them lower Then his bright Angels, both in will &amp; power, He is so miserably sordid, that So his Coffers be fill'd, and his estate May thrive, he is content to let his name Lye dead and buried, he regards not fame. The gripling Miser for a fool may go, He thinks Gods treasury too empty to Content him, he Gods glory never sees, And will not trust him on bare promises, As God (which never will leave his) he leaves So to the world (which cannot help) he cleaves, Better then his own soul, the rich fool loves His Gold, and within his own circle moves, He wrinckles and contracts (by saving charges) His body, by this means his purse enlarges: He to himself will scarce a meal afford, But is a constant ghost at Satans board. No marvail he hear not mens craving wants, When he himself is deaf to the complaints Of his own belly, to which he is ever Endebted, and is like to pay it never: He never paid his belly nor his back, A quarter of their dues, he loves no Sack, Nor Cates, the smallest beer, the coursest meat, Is good enough for him to drink or eat: Prides vanity he doth so much detest, Which doth esteem the dearest things the best, That he thinks nothing sweet but what is cheap; Gold is the thing he dreams on in his sleep, Which is but little, Gold and Silver are His Idol, which the heathens Idols were: He hath the Silver Dropsie, he implores More still, Gold is the goddess he adores, He thinks all flesh that comes within his Nets, Nor cares he how he gets; but what he gets: He is no niggard of his labour, or A time-neglector, sloth he doth abhor, It's ever term with him, his business Admits of no vacation, nothing less Than Holy-dayes he loves, the greater gain, Is still attended with the greater pain, He often sayes, but yet he is not pleas'd, As he is never fill'd, so never eas'd. He findeth no Soul-satisfaction; And is when all is done, a man undone: Riches have many wretches drown'd in this World, Sea, and kept them from the shore of bliss: Riches are thievish, stealing unawares The heart, and Satans soul entrapping snares. The Miser digs to hell for wealth, so that The Devil is his next neighbour: O hard fate! On earth himself he heavens, and himself Of bliss he couzens, for a little pelf, Rest from his own bones, he himself hath stole, Peace from his conscience, grace from his soul, And is not he a Thief? nothing can fill Th'unfathom'd gulf of his insatiat will. This Horse-leech cries, give, give, this Cormorant The more he doth desire, the more doth want, The dunghil Wretch, troubled with Midas Itch, Becomes a beggar by becoming rich; Nay, worldly men more miserable are Than Beggars, these want little, have less care, They much, and till they dye no good do doe, Who is rich? he that covers nothing? who Is poor? the covetous; he is not poor Which enjoys little, but desireth more. There's many have too much, scarce one but wishes For more, the sea sufficeth all the fishes; The Earth sufficeth all the beasts likewise, But the whole world cannot one man suffice. Wild Beasts are filled, and do spare the prey, But Misers are insatiable, they Like hell, say never 'tis enough, but having Too much already, still for more are craving: The miserable man himself unblesses, By not injoying that which he possesses; What benefit is there of Gold while 'tis Embowell'd in the Mine? wealth worthless is If it so hoarded up, and cloystred be In Coffers, as the light it never see. How well may the rich churl be likened to A Christmas-box, chink he receives, but lo He parts with none, till death this box uncase, Then Gold and Silver tumbles out a pace: Camels bear but one burden, rich men two, Wealth, sin, and that in death he must forgoe This in and after death, sticks fast t'his back, And will be to him an eternal Rack. Desire, distrust, fear, hope, and dispair are His tort'ring furies, just, as if he were In Phal'ris burning Bull, he that's a slave To his own servant, shall bad usage have: He that is once Christs servant, will not be A slave to Mammon, the worlds deity. It is observable, two things perplex The whole world, Mine, and Thine, riches do vex, For they are Thornes; riches do flee away, For they have wings, nor can we with them stay: To fly from avarice is to obtain A Kingdom; godliness is the best gain: He must be master of his wealth that is Gods servant, O if Heaven that place of bliss, Becomes our object, the earth will become Our abject, and the issues of her womb. The Miser fears not God, nor honors man, He thinketh that Religion, which can Make best for his advantage, is the best; What brings him in no gain he doth detest: He will Gehazi like, bare bribes away, And will with Judas for a gift betray His Lord and Master, and say with him too, Why is this waste, when some good any do: His chiefest good he judgeth riches still, And poverty fears as the greatest ill; Money is his creator, when wealths had In great abundance, then he thinks he's made: It's his Redeemer, when woes on him thrust, He flies t'his money, that redeem him must: It is his comforter, when he is sad, He tells his money, and that makes him glad. He with his golden harps expells away The evil spirit, you may truly say, When you see one who doth his Gold prefer Before God, there goes an Idolater, Care is the Vultur gnaws upon his heart, And he damns his own self t'Ixions smart On conscience tort'ring wheel; he's evermore Like Tantalus, starved in the midst of store, He'l go on errands to the Devil, so gaines Send him, and well reward him for his pains: His wretched mind bends to no point but this, He who hath most of wealth, hath most of bliss. As he is good to none, so is he worst T'himself, he lives abhorr'd, and dies accurst. Philosophers affirm that Mines of Gold, Are always fruitless, and the Devils Freehold: So are those minds that Gold admire do, Barren, and haunted by the Devil too. 380. On a Cough. A cough cannot be hid no more (they say) Can love, external signs do them bewray. 381. On a Coulter. Did not the coulter cut the earth, the share Were useless, and the ground no Corn would So till manur'd by grace, we barren are. 382. On Counsel. 1 Christ is a Counsellour, directing still His Clients, how to manage and transact All their designs according to the Will And Law of God; his wisdom can effect Great things, in Heavens decrees he is well read, He knows our state and case, and how to plead. 2 Christ faithful is, to tell the naked truth, And if the cause be bad, he will not plead it. Bribes cannot blind his eyes, nor stop his mouth; Men slight his peoples cause, but he doth heed it. Though he be offer'd by the Prince of Hell, All the Worlds glory, souls he will not sell. 3 Christ he is the best spoken Counsellour, Never man spake in Earths rotundity So sweetly; and with such convincing power, And so authoritatively as he. Christ Jesus doth all Counsellours surpass, If he plead for us, happy is our case. 4 He that acts nothing but with good advise, Need not repent him when the deed is past; Who rashly sets upon an enterprise, Repents by leisure what was done in haste. Fond Epimetheus locks the Stable dore, When the Steed's stole, Prometheus before. 5 Figulus having lost the Consulship, Thus to his friends then comforting him, spake, All (now you see my honour from me slip) Can give me counsel, but ye cannot make Me Consul: if we could events foresee, Great evils timely might prevented be. 383. On the Countenance. 'Tis the Index of the mind, Shewing how we are inclin'd, Grace more pleases, if it glance From a comely countenance But a heart that shines with grace, Doth surpass the fairest face. Gratior est pulchro veniens è corpore virtus. 384. On a Counter. A counter is of small account, so we Are little worth, till sanctifi'd we be. 385. On a Counterfeit. A kiss preceded glozing Judas Treason, Counterfeit shews, are never out of season, And oftentimes transcend the bounds of reason A counterfeit Religion shall find A real Hell, for Hypocrites assign'd, How blest are they whose hearts with grace are lin'd! 386. On a Countermine. Satan will countermine us, if we do Dig for salvations Mine, malicious so! 387. On a Counterpane. Glory is for the Saints, writings are drawn And seal'd, holiness is the Counterpane. 388. On a Counter-poyson. What though I have a sin-envenom'd soul, Christ's bloud by faith appli'd, can make me whole. 389. On Countervail. Short-liv'd affliction, cannot countervail Triumphant glory, which shall never fail. 390. On County. Gods gifts abound in ev'ry County, But O, how few admire his bounty. 391. On Country. What thou here on us many sorrows come, We are but strangers, Heaven is our home, Ours by the Fathers Ordination; Ours freely purchas'd for us by the Son; Ours sealed to us by the Holy-Ghost, To our own country, we apace do post: Though now we be but wards, and not possest Of it, yet are we Heirs to it at least: When we to perfect growth in grace attain, We shall a plenary possession gain. God give us grace, to find repentance way, That come to our own home, at last we may. 392. On a Couple. A pair of Pigeons, or two Turtle-doves, God will accept, who free-will offrings loves, 393. On Courage. Fortitude is the fairest blossom that Springs from a noble mind, its heat and hate Conquers the enemy before the field Be sought in; Valiant Saints makes Satan yield, It is a noble Conquest to o'rethrow A potent Foe, and never strike a blow. 394 On a Course. The whole course of our living must Be loving, let us never thrust Love out of doors, many will talk Of love; few love in Love to walk. 395. On a Courser. What speed the courser makes, we have a race To run, O why do we not mend our pace? The prize is glory, which is won by grace. 396. On a Courtier. Perfumed Silk-worms, shining bubbles, That Pedlars shops about them bear, Frequent the place of glorious troubles, Sad coming were such anticks are! Better be in Gods Court a Porter, Than dwell where glistring sinners quarter. 397. On a Cousener. A man may cousen man unseen, But God will not be mock'd, He hath a Key to let him in, Although the heart be lock'd, Lord! I confess my sins to thee, O be thou pleas'd to pardon me. 398. On a Cowl. An ag'd Matron neer her end, Did request her Belgick friend, A bald Friar's crown t'extend Over her, (as saves the story:) E're she was of life bereaven, That her sins might be forgiven, And her Soul might pass to Heaven, Without entering Purgatory: O how sad are their condition, Who are kept in superstition! 399. On a Cow. God's word t'our souls doth sincere Milk allow For nourishment, not so the vb'rous Cow. 400. On a Coward. Satan is like a French-man, bold at first, Resist him, and you'l put him to the worst. 401. On a Crab-fish, Crab-tree. How many in Religions trade, Do like the Crab-fish retrograde, And like the Crab-tree can produce, No fruits but sow'r, sarce fit for use. 402. On a Cradle. Securitie's a Cradle, we must keep Strict watch, lest Satan lull us fast asleep. 403. On Craft. Satan, who hath so long a Tempter been, Hath gain'd experience, now he Tempts to sin, Under a shew of piety, anon He work's upon our constitution; Having commenc'd Master of his black Art, His knowledge to his sons he doth impart. The crafti'st head that mischiefs can produce, The Dev'l doth choose, as fittest for his use, But such as Pol'ticks learn in Plutoe's Schools, At last prove doters, and lean-witted fools. 404. On Cramming. Our bodies are well-cramm'd, and pampered, Whilst our souls pine for want of living bread. 405. On the Cramp. The Cramp contracts and pulls the sinnews in, So grace checks sinners, who run mad in sin. 406. On a Crane. I must be wratchful as the Thracian fowl, Or else the Devil will surprize my Soul. 407. On a Crany. A fault in others through the smallest crany, Is seen, and talk'd of, but alas! scarce any, See &amp; confess their own, though they have many. 408. On a Crasiness. God sets us work to do, our souls are lazy, And want of stirring, makes them sick and crazy. 409. On a Cratch. O strange! he that did in his wisdom stretch Th'heav'ns out, lay cradled in a simple cratch 410. On Craving. Our wants are great, the only way of having Them still suppli'd, is to be always craving. 411. On a Creaking noise. Man not regards the creaking of a Cart, Nor God the pray'rs of an ungracious heart. 412. On a Creak. How many souls are there that spring a leak, And suffer Ship-wrack er'e they touch the creak! 413. On Cream. God's word is Milk, the Hearer is the Boul To keep it in, in ev'ry gracious soul, It turns to Cream, which he in praises, pray'rs, Doth offer up to God's attentive eares. 414. On Creation. One ask'd why man was made; made this reply, To view the Heavens, and to magnifie God in his creatures; him Philosophers Call'd Uranoscopus, viewing the Stars. God opes his Cabinet, and gives us eyes To view his Treas'ry, also hearts to prize, And tongues to praise his goodness, for bestowing All things on us to whom our souls are owing. The worlds a Book, wherein a general story, God reads to us dumb lectures of his glory, All creatures teach, and somewhat us inform, From th'highest Angel to the lowest worm; The world's a Glass, wherein we may discern Our Makers majesty, and viewing learn T'admire and praise him, which if we for bear To do, like Stones, and Beasts, and Devils we are. The creatures are the staires by which we may Climb up, and so the glorious power survey Of the Creator: Bees from ev'ry flower Suck Honey, pious Christians evermore, From ev'ry action, or event deduce What they convert to admirable use. All objects to a contemplative man, Are like wings to his thoughts, which raise him can Upward to Heaven, as the old Romans when They saw blue stones, thought of Olympus, then Intentively observe the works of Nature, Then serve attentively the worlds Creator: Let us by each presented object thrive In grace, some profit to our selves derive, In this be selfish: O shall we still plod On the great Volume of the works of God, And never throughly learn to spell one word Which benefit, and comfort may afford? Shall we still pore on Natures book (alas!) And ne're translate it to the Book of grace, As some have done? O what rare melodie Is there in Heaven, if earthly Musick be So sweet! if pomp attend a Court below, Surely Gods Court will make a glorious show: O blessed object, and observed well, That makes the musing Soul, in grace t'excell! 415. On Credence. Assent and giving credence to All that the Scripture saith, Concerning Christ, who suffer'd so, Precedent is to Faith. 416. On Credit. As of our conscience we must have a care, So likewise of our credit, never dare Unseemly things, Saints have a lasting name, When sinners reputation turns to shame: It's a good thing to have praise to us carv'd, But it's a better to have praise deserv'd: This credit wealth cannot procure, but grace, Not goods but goodness; happy is his case, Whose own heart not condemns him, such as do Honour the Lord, he them will honour too. 417. On a Creditor. God is a Creditor, he lends Us time and talents to improve, Which who so misimploys mispends, Provokes to wrath the God of Love. Sin is a debt, our Creditor is just, And if our surety pay it not, we must. 418. On Credulity. Tis a vice to believe nothing, or none; All things, or all, that is said to be done: A cred'lous man is to a fool a kin, Believing all he hears, this brings strife in, A wiseman will not at the first rebound, Take a report, Truth is by sifting found. 419. On the Creed. You that have heard so much of Christ, can pray, Yet cannot with humble adherence say, My Jesus, and my Lord, I tell you true, The Devil can say his Creed as well as you: Lord, I believe not only that thou art, And what thou sayst, but in thee, may I part With all for thee, and from thee never start. 420. On Creeping. In sin (alas!) our motion is not slow, In duty, oh! how creepingly we goe. 421. On a Cresset-light. Lord! set the Beacon of my heart on fire With Holy zeal, and let the flame aspire To thee, the highest Orb of my desire. 422. On a Crest. Such as do go with an elated Crest, Shall be cast down, but such as are deprest With sense of sin, shall be advanc'd and blest. 423. On a Crib. Oh! if the Ass her Masters crib doth know, Man should know God, who all the world doth ow: His Maker, his Redeemer, who supplies, His wants, and pities his infirmities. 424. On a Cricket. As merry as a Cricket one may be, Whose heart is fill'd with dire perplexity. 425. On a Crier. Gods Ministers are Criers, and they dare not But crie aloud, &amp; shew to men and spare not Their horrid sins, dumb Preachers that betray Their trust, shall be condemned another day. 426. On a Crime. The bloud of Christ can expiate a fault, Not to be purg'd with Brimstone, Fire, &amp; Salt 427. On a Cripple. Adam became a Cripple by his fall, Hence lame in holy duties are we all; But some belong to Jesus Hospital. 428. On a Critick. It's easier to find fault then To imitate; the transverse pen Of snarling Mome dashes this out, And Aristarch at that doth pout. My Soul condemn thy self, and know That God to thee will favour show. 429. On the Crocodile. Nile's poys'ny Pyrate kils (Historians say) The man, then bathes him in his tears straitway. So some whose rear-commanding eys let fall Dissembling showres, have hearts brim fill'd with gal. 430. On a Crost. Great God plough up my heart, that fallow-field, And sow thy grace therein; O make it yield A fruitful crop, that thou may'st have the praise, And I enjoy the benefits always. 431. On Croises or Pilgrims. The Cross-sign'd Pilgrim travels far to some Devotious place, to him Christ bids us come, And he will to our Country bring us home. 432. On a Crook. Christ is our Shepherd, &amp; his Spir't the Crook That guides us in the way we have forsook. 433. On a Cross. One may be signed with the Cross, And yet for Heaven be at a loss. 434. On a Cross way. Cross is the way that leadeth to a Crown, No man can go to Heaven on beds of doun. 435. On a Cross-bow. Affliction is a Cross-bow, endless bliss The white, by that a Saint is sent to this. 436. On a Cross-row. The child learns by degrees the Christ-crossrow, So we (alas!) come all by ease to know The things of God, and what to God we owe. 437. On Crosses. Enngland alas! for many years hath seen Enough of crosses; here hath always been Cross doing, and Cross dealing with each other, How many heretofore have kept a pother, To pull material crosses down? there are But few pull sin down from them, and prepare To bear Crists Cross, which he on them doth lay Crosses to Heaven are a surer way Than pleasures; crosses are the turning key Of Paradise, Saints by them have no loss. Wicked men crosses have, but not Christs cross. Suppose I meet with crosses, crosses are A Cath'lick mis'ry; therein all men share, And should I grieve? this reason may suggest This is constraint, godly content is best. Saints by the Christ-cross (though no letter) know More than by all the Letters in the row. God sends his sons to th'Free-School of the Cross, Where they learn best, the fire consumes their dross And purifies them; Golden Christians have Been tri'd, God smites in love, that he may save What ever crosses do the Saint molest, His last end, shall assuredly be blest. Crosses not only mind us of our crimes, But also serve to better us sometimes. We climb up by the Cross to Heavens story. The cross-way is the only way to glory. Ferre quam sortem patiuntur omnes Nemo recusat. ? 438. On Crotchets. Some crotchets in his head a man may have Sometimes, and yet be neither Fool nor Knave 439. On a Crowd. Multitudes crowd to Hell apace, The way of sin is broad, Few travel towards Heaven (alas!) Grace is a narrow road. 440 On Crowing. The crowing of a Cock amazes sore The Emperour of Beasts, and makes him rore; It foreshews change of weather: Peters eye When the Cock crew, shed tears abundantly. 441. On a Crown. On Earth Saints all their life are gold preparing, To make a Crown in heaven worth the wearing, Saints their Crown-royal have: Crowns only are For Kings and Princes of renown to wear: Their Crown is free from care, 'tis not envi'd, For all are crown'd, theirs always doth abide. Pardon's a mercy, but rich mercy 'tis To crown us; O what kind of love is this! How will the Saints advanc'd to Heaven above, Read over Lectures of Free-grace and Love. And O how will they forth his praises sound, Who with his loving kindnesses are crown'd! Alas! that men should be so stupid grown, As for a rattle to forego a Crown. 442. On a Crowner. The Crowner by his Quest finds murder out, Soul-search for sin we seldom go about. 443. On a Crucifix. Many do superstitiously adore The Crucifix, who cannot yet abide, The Cross of Christ, and trample on the floor With scornfull feet, the blood of God beside: Like that French King, who when he swore would kiss The Cross, as if nothing were then amiss. 444. On Cruelty. The Devils cruelty transcends the rage Of greatest Tyrants, that in any age Quaff'd humane blood, Charybdis chaf'd with wind, Or the fell Tyger of th'Armenian kind, Is not so rough, so fierce, as he is when He hath seiz'd on his prey, the souls of men. His name's Apollyon, he rent and tore The man in whom he was, and made him rore. O! if when chain'd he was so fierce, so hot, What will he do when he full pow'r hath got! 445. On a Crum. Lord, we do not deserve in greatest need A crum of bread; For we have broken all the sacred bands Of thy commands. Yet in Christ Jesus all things we possess, O give us hearts thy praises to express. 446. On a Crupper. The crupper keeps the Saddle steady, so But for restraint, great evils men would do. 447. On a Cruse. Lord may I to thy glory use The little that is in my cruse, Whilst most their plenty do abuse. 448. On a Crust. Lord I will not complain of want, Whilst thou a crust to me dost grant: Nor will I say thou art unjust, If that should fail, but in thee trust. 449. On a Crutch. When the poor man is falling, such To whom the Lord hath given much Of worldly means, should never grutch To stay him with a silver Crutch. 450. On crying Sins. Sins crying are, when come to their full height, When God more special notice of them takes, They call for present help even in a streight, God hears their cry, and the stout sinner shakes, How wicked are our times! O Heav'n forgive Our crying sins, and let poor England live. 451. On a Cub. Although the fool at small beginnings mocks, A Cub may prove in time a ravenous Fox. 452. On a Cubit. Our Saviour said, what man can add One cubit to its stature, By taking care, and yet all are Thereto inclin'd by nature. 453. On a Cube. A cube Hieroglyphically shews An honest man, whose actions are square, With such converse; his company refuse Whose dealings like a sphere, are circular. 454. On a Cuckold. The horned He-moon never thanks returns To him that made him, &amp; gave him his horns. But yet men gratifie the Devil when in Their hearts they nourish his foul bastard sin. 455. On a Cuckow. The Cuckow in one tune delighteth still, So do the most of men in acting ill. 456. On a Cuckquean, A Cuckquean is a Jade that for base pelf. Becomes a Hackney, &amp; lets out her self; Though men who love their wives cannot abide her, Wife-haters, though she brings to hell, will ride her. 457. On a Cucumber. It is by nature cold, and so are we, To what is good, till warm'd by grace we be 458. On the Cud. When we do read or hear that which is good, We should by meditation chew the cud. 459. On a Cudgel. When Love unreasonably is abus'd, Then is a Cudgel seasonably us'd. 460. On a Cuff. Sinners do love to play at blind mans buff, And Satan unawares gives them a cuff. 461. On Cuffs. Grace makes men gallant, &amp; doth more adorn, Than ruffling cuffs which on mens wrists are worn. 462. On Cunning. To avoid Satans snares we must be cunning, The prize before our eyes is won by running. 463. On a Cup. As to us here for Jesus Christ his sake, The bitter cup of persecution's given; So we from Jesus Christ his hands shall take, The sweet cup of salvation in Heaven. 464. On a Cupboard. The Cup-board serves to keep provision in, Mans heart holds in it, either grace or sin. 465. On a Cupping-Glass. Physitians use the Cupping-glass to draw Our bloud, with scarrify'ng of the skin, And so a Christian must use the Law, To suck out the corrupted bloud of sin. 466. On a Curate. The thin-fac'd Curate taketh all the pains, Yet he can scarce pick out a livelyhood, The bouncing Parson raketh all the gains; Though he (God knows) does very little good, I fear at the great day of Christs appearing, This will appear to be a crime past cleering. 467. On Curd. To be without as white as Curd, And black within is most absur'd, From such, deliver us good Lord! 468. On a Curfew. This night the Bell calls to bed, but oh! Before the next, my passing Bell may go. 469. On Curiosity. It's the most common vice of almost all Wise men, some it hath made heretical: O what a let to holiness and bliss, Is curiosity, it makes men miss The sum of their desires; we ought to know Gods secrets may not be enquir'd into: Who would compr'end a majesty unbounded, He with its glory, must be needs confounded: An over-curious pervestigation, Into the Ask of Gods predestination, With Pride, and danger too, attended is, T'enquire the cause of Gods decree, why this And not that man is chose, seems not to me, An act of Judgment, but of Lunacy: The question is as guilty of reproof, As he that the bold Author is thereof. Adam was driven out of Paradise, For his affecting to be overwise: Isr'el had dy'd the death, if they had past Their bounds, to climb up (as they would in hast) Unto the Mount, and so to gaze upon The glorious Lord:—no center to rest on, This vice can find, but it leads men into The endless Labyrinths of smarting woe: Let's not be over-wise, it is not fit, That we presume above that which is writ: The Bethshemites prying into the Ark Were smitten blind, safe being in the dark, Where is no warrant, nor command to know, Nice curiousness is the high-way to woe: Lord what I may not narrowly enquire Into; O teach me fully to admire. Scrutator majestatis opprimetur a gloria. 470. On a Cure. Sin is a Soul-disease, which no Physitian, Save Christ can heal, who knows best the condition Of each distemp'red patient; he is sure To speed, who seeks in faith to him for cure: Till cur'd we are, we are unfit to do God any service, that he puts us to. Lord! I believe that my poor sin-sick soul Shall be, if thou but say the word, made whole. 471. On Currant money. The Saints of God, for currant money pass In heavens Kingdom, being stampt with grace 472. On a Curre. Sinners are snarling currs, and they delight To bark at Saints? but them they cannot bite. 473. On the Current. Salvation-work (which we should make our strife Is hard, because the currant of the life Is to be altered; that the Tide of sin, Which ran so strong before, should now agin Be turn'd; that men sailing to Hell with speed, Should now sail Heav'n-ward? here's a work indeed! O Lord be pleas'd to sanctifie me so, That what is good, I make think, speak and do. 474. On Currents. Base lusts are sweet, to Satan's Apes; As to the taste Corinthian Grapes. 475. On a Currier. This Leather-dresser labours har'd Spurr'd on by recompencing gaines; O did we think of our reward In heav'n, we should for heaven take pains. For such as labour shall have rest, And they that persevere are blest. 476. On Cursedness. He is accurs'd, that being born in sin, (Recovery unsought) lives, dyes therein. He that from Christ hath not a pardon first, Must hear from Christ, this sentence, Go ye curst: O suffer not thy slumbring eyes to rest, Till Christ hath seal'd thee a Quietus est, Give no peace to thy self, till thou with God Have peace, thou art still under the black Rod, Till thou repent, he that in known sins goes On wilfully, is damned in the close: O let not us retain, nor entertain, Sin, lest on us the curse thereof remain. Quamdiu impænitentia manet, maledictio imminef. 477. On Curses. The curses mentioned in sacred Story, Are sinners portions, yea their Inventory, And at the day of death their portion shall Be truly paid them, pleasure ends in Gall, And though perchance (enjoying good success) They in their wickedness, themselves do bless: Yet are they heir-apparents to God's curse, And what (pray tell me) can befall them worse: O if we could avoid the curses due For sin, repent we must, and sin eschew. 478. On Crusing. Some have (as well as Job) cursed the day Of their first birth, but of their second birth, None ever curs'd the day, O blessed they That are New-born! that day occasions mirth. Cursing is made the common weapon now Of anger, and the ill he cannot do, Wrath wishes, sad it is it should be so. 479. On Curstness. Curst Cows have shortest hornes, &amp; he that can Talk most, is not always the wisest man. 480. On a Curtain. Sin is a Curtain drawn between The Soul, and God's bright shining face, His glory, ah! cannot be seen, Till sin be vanquish'd by his conqu'ring grace. 481. On a Courtesie. We must not strein at courtesie to see Who shall go first, but each one strive to be Foremost in duty, in this strife agree. 482. On a Curtezan, or a two-legg'd Jade. Room, pray Sirs room, I can no longer hold, My fury in, since vice is so extold.— Impudent quean! who ne're had so much grace, As is portended by the blushing face, To swarm like Bees! here's master to infuse An angry zeal into a frozen Muse; And now my just incensed Muse proclaims An open War against salacious Dames And their rank Riders; she intends to throw Her whirling Arrows, from her twanging Bow, At such as do belong to Venus Court, And are delighted with that beastly sport: Who Tinder-boxes love, and will adventure On Quivers ope, for every shaft to enter, O shameful! Silken gallants have their queans, And filthy drabs, which soak away their means, They waste their strength on such, as are no less Than the Elixars of all naughtiness, Half-eaten with the Pox, alluring Dames, Are fuel which do feed their lustful flames: But more of this—and such as love the trade, Expect kind Reader, when I come to Jade. 483. On a Cushion. Idleness is the Devils Cushion, By sitting on it, thousands are undone. 484. On Custody. A christian must set a constant guard About his heart, and keep with watch &amp; ward His heart; his heart must still be in his eye, The heart requires the strictest custody: For 'tis the spring, which maketh all our deeds Run pure, or muddy, life from thence proceeds. Lock up thy heart with God, (how safe are they That daily do so?) and give him the Key. 485. On Custom, or Tole. Levi no sooner call'd from the Receit Of Custom, does upon his Savior wait, And at his home, makes him a costly feast; He could not entertain a better guest. Lord! if it be thy custom to take tole, Satan may take my sins, take thou my Soul. 486. On Custom, or Use. Sin, which is weight enough to sink down quite The world, is made (alas) by custom, light; Custom in sin obstupities sense so, That men scarce know, whether they sin or no, Sin gathers strength by custom, by degrees It creeps, like some contagious disease: Milo first bear a Calfe, and still his strength Encreasing with his burden, he at length Became so able and so powerful, That he could bear with ease a goring Bull: Custom that second nature, is sometimes A friend to vertue, but more oft to crimes. 487. On a Cutler. He is a Blade that lives by making blades, But he that in the Ordinances trades, Shall live, though death his mortal life invades. 488. On a Cut-purse, Cut-throat. He is an arrant Thief that cuts the purse, And he a murtherer, that cuts the throat; that indeed be bad, yet this is worse, oth deserve to wear a Pendant knot ch below the ears, 'its good to do others as we would be done unto. 489. On a Cynick. The Cynick in his Tub, found more content, Than Alexander in his glistering Throne; In Contemplation his time he spent; This wept, because no more Worlds were his own. 290. On the Cynosure. The Pilot well observes the Cynosure, And so should we God, that Northern Star; Until we touch the Port, and land secure In Heav'n, that Haven where no dangers are, Where neither sin our happiness destroys, Nor sorrow interrupts our endless joys. The Post-script to the Reader. 1 Thus (Reader) have I finish'd as thou seest, The first three Letters of the Criss-cross Row, More Grapes I have, which shall not now be prest, How well thou wilt like these, I do not know, If this Tast please, thou mayst command my store. The Vineyard of my Muse can yield thee more. 2 I pray thee let my absence from the Press; Obtain that of thee, which thy presence shall Obtain of me, (a favour I confess) T'amend the Errors Typographical, So shall the Printer, and the Author too, Be bound to serve thee in what we can do.
