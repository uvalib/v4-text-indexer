Leaf 1 in a hand about 1700 A.D.] Heere begynnyth the Book how Pryncys sholden be governyd. 1 Mvsyng vpon the restles bisynesse Which that this troubly world hath ay on honde, That othir thyng than fruyt of byttirnesse Ne yeldeth nought, as I can vndirstonde, At Chestre ynn√´, right fast be the stronde, As I lay in my bed vp-on a nyght, Thought me bereft of sleep with force and myght. 2 And many a day and nyght that wykked hyne Hadd√´ beforn vexid my poor√´ goost So grevously, that of anguysh and pyne No richere man was nougher in no coost; This dar I seyn, may no wight make his boost That he with thought was bettir than I aqveynted, For to the deth it wel nigh hath me feynted. 3 Bysily in my mynde I gan revolue The welthe onsure of everye creature, How lightly that ffortune it can dissolue, Whan that hir lyst that it no lenger dure; And of the brotylnesse of hyre nature, My tremlyng hert so gret√´ gastnesse hadde, That my spiritis were of my lyf√´ sadde. 4 Me fel to mynde how that, not long ago, ffortun√´s strok doun threst estaat royal Into myscheef; and I took heed also Of many anothir lord that had a fall; In mene estaat eek sikernesse at all Ne saw I noon; but I sey att√´ laste, Wher s√´wrte, for to abyde, hir caste. 5 Yn poore estaat sche pyght hir paviloun, To covere hire from the storm of descendyng; For [that] sche kneew no lowere discencion, Save oonly deth, fro which no wight lyvyng Defendyn hym may; and thus, in my musyng, I destitut was of joye and good hope, And to myn es√´ no thyng koude I groope. 6 For right as blyv√´ ran it in my thought, Though I be poore, yet som what leese I may; Than deemed I that seur√´te would nought With me abyde, it is nought to hir pay, Ther to soiurne as sche descend√´ may; And thus vnsikir of my smal lyfloode, Thought leyd on me full many an hevy loode. 7 I thought eek, if I in-to povert creepe, Than am I entred in-to sykirnesse; But swich seurete myght I ay wayle and weepe, ffor poverte breedeth but hevynesse. Allas! wher is this worldis stabilnesse? Heer vp, heer doun; heer honour, heer repreef; Now hool, now seek; now bounte, now myscheef. 8 Boecius de consolatione Philosophi√¶; maximum genus infortunii est, fuisse felicem &amp;c.And whan I hadd√´ rolled vp and doun This world√´s stormy waw√´s in my mynde, I seey weel povert was exclus√Øon Of all weelfar√´ regnyng in mankynde; And how in book√´s thus I wryten fynde, ‚ÄúThe werst√´ kynde of wrecchedness√´ is, A man to hav√´ been weelfull or this.‚Äù 9 ‚ÄúAllas!‚Äù √æoghte I, ‚Äúwhat sykirnesse ys √æat To lyue ay seur of greef and of nuisaunce? What schal I do? best is I stryu√´ nat Agayne √æe pays of fortun√´s balaunce; ffor wele I wote, √æat hir brotel constaunce, A wyght no whil√´ suffer can soiourne In a plyt; √æus nat wiste I how to torne. 10 ffor whan a man wene√æ stond most constant, √ûan is he next√´ to his ouer throwyng; So flyttyng is sche, and so wariant, Ther is no trust vp-on hir fair lawhyng; After glad loue sche schapi√æ hir to styng; I was a-drad so of hir gerynesse, That my lif was but a dedly gladnesse.‚Äù 11 Thus ilk√´ nyught I walwyd to and fro, Sekyng rest√´; but, certeynly sche Appeerid noght, for √æoght, my crewel fo, Chaced hadde hir &amp; slepe a-way fro me; And for I schuld√´ not a-lon√´ be, Agayn my luste, Wach profrid his seruise, And I admittid hym in heuy wyse. 12 So long a nyught ne felde I neuer non, As was √æat sam√´ to my iug√´ment; Who so √æat thoghty is, is wo-be-gon; √ûe √æoghtful wight is vessel of turment, √ûer nys no greef to him equipolent; He graue√æ deppest of seekenesses alle; fful wo is him √æat in swich thoght is falle. 13 What whyght √æat inly pensif is, I trowe, His moste desire is to be solitarie; √ûat √æis is so√æ, in my persone I knowe, ffor euere whil √æat fretynge aduersarie Myn hert[e] mad√´ to hym tributarie, In sowkynge of √æe fresschest of my blod, To sorwe soule, me thoght it dide me good. Vnde Marcialis Cocus: Ille dolet vere qui sine teste dolet. 14 ffor √æe nature of heuynesse is √æis: If it habound√´ gretly in a wight, √ûe place eschewit he where as ioye is, ffor ioye &amp; he not mowe accorde a-ryght; As discordant as day is vn-to nyught, And honur, aduersarie is vn-to schame, Is heuyness√´ so to ioye and game. 15 Whan to √æe √æoghtful whi?t is tolde a tale, He heeri√æ it as √æogh he √æenn√´s were; Hys heuy thoght√´s hym so plukke &amp; hale Hyder and √æedir, and hym greue &amp; dere, √ûat hys er√´s auayle hym nat a pere; He vnderstonde√æ no √æing what men seye, So ben his wytt√´s fer gon hem to pleye. 16 √ûe smert of √æoght, I by experience knowe as wel as any man do√æ lyuynge; His frosty swoot &amp; fyry hote feruence, And troubly drem√´s, drempt al in wakynge, My mayzed heed sleeplees han of konnynge, And wyt dispoylyd, &amp; so me be-iapyd, √ûat after de√æ ful often haue I gapid. [HOCCLEVE'S MEETING AND DIALOGUE WITH AN OLD BEGGAR.] 17 Passe ouer whanne √æis stormy nyght was gon, And day gan at my wyndowe in to prye, I roos me vp, for boot√´ fonde I non In myn vnresty bed lenger to lye; In-to √æe feld I dressed me in hye, And in my wo, y herte-depe gan wade, As he √æat was bareyne of √æoght√´s glade. 18 By √æat I walkyd hadde a certeine tyme, Were it an houre, I not or more or lesse, A poore olde hor√´ man cam walkyng by me, And seyd√´, ‚Äúgood day, syre, &amp; god yow blysse!‚Äù But I no word; for my seekly distresse ffor-bad myn eres vsen hire office, ffor which √æis olde man helde me lewed &amp; nyce, 19 Tyl he tooke hed√´ to my drery chere, And to my deedly colour pale &amp; wan; Thanne thoghte he √æus:‚Äî√æis man √æat I se here, Al wrong is wrestid, by oght √æat I se can: He sterte vp to me, &amp; seyde, ‚Äúscleepys √æou, man? Awake!‚Äù &amp; gan me schak√´ wonder faste, And with a sigh I answerde att√´ laste. (Hoccleve and Beggar.) ‚ÄúA! who is √æer?‚Äù ‚ÄúI,‚Äù quod √æis old√´ greye, ‚ÄúAm heer,‚Äù &amp; he me told√´ the manere How he spak to me, as ye herd me seye; ‚ÄúO man,‚Äù quo√æ I, ‚Äúfor crist√´s lou√´ dere, If √æat √æou wolt aght done at my preyere, As go √æi way, talk√´ to me no more, √ûi word√´s al annoyen me ful sore; (Hoccleve and Beggar.) ‚ÄúVoyd√´ fro me; me list no compaignye; Encress√´ noght my grife; I haue I-now.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy sone, hast √æou good lust √æi sorwe drye, And mayst releu√´d be? what man art √æou?

Nay, lat be √æat! sche knew wel √æat √æis yle May neuer man forth bryng√´ lyk to the, And hir offic√´ need√´s do mot she; God bad hir so, I truste as for thi beste; O maister, maister, god √æi soule reste! 302 Now to my matere, as that I began: There is a booke, Iacob de Cessoles, Of √æe ordre of Prechours, made, a worthy man, That ‚Äúthe Chesse moralis√®d‚Äù cleped is, In which I purpose eke to laboure y-wis, And here &amp; there, as that my litell witte Afforth√´ may, I thynk√´ tr√°nslate it. 303 And al be it that in that plac√´ square Of the lyst√´s, I mane √æe eschekere, A man may lern√´ to be wise &amp; ware, I, that haue auentured many a yere, My witte there-in is but litill the nere, Save that somwhat I knowe a kyng√´s draught; Of other draught√´s, lerned haue I naught. 304 And, for that among the draught√´s euerychone That vnto √æe chess√´ apperten√´ may, Is none so ned√´full vnto your persone To knowe, as that of the cheert√´ verray That I haue hade vnto your noblesse ay, And shall, yf your plesaunce it be to here, A kyng√´s draught, reporte I shall now here. 305 I am sure that the book√´s all√´ thre, Redde hath &amp; seen your Innat sapience; And, as I hope, her vertues folwen ye; But vnto you compile I this sentence, That, at the goode luste of your excellence, In short ye may behold and rede That in hem thre is skatered ferre in brede. 306 And √°lthough it be no man√©r of nede Yow to counseil√´ what to done or leve, Yf √æat you liste of stories to take hede, Somwhat it may profit√´, by your leve: At hardest, when √æat ye ben in Chambre at eve, They ben good√´ to driv√´ forth the nyght; They shull not harme, yf √æey be herd a-right. 307 To your hyeness√´, thynke it not to longe, Though in that draught I somwhat wad√´ deepe; The thew√´s vertuous that to it longe Wacchen my gost, &amp; letten him to slepe. Now God in vertu mayntene you and kepe!

Vn-to good reul√´ ye yow knytte and bynde; Of godd√´s wrech√´ haue ay drede and awe; Do right to grete and smale, and keep√´ lawe. 311 On√´s √æer was a kyng, as I haue rad, Whan his coron√´ was vn-to hym broght, Or he it tok, in thoght he stood al sad, And √æus he seid√´, after he had thoght: ‚ÄúO √æou corone, noble and faire y-wroght, What man that √æe receyueth or admittith, More es√´ √æan he weneth from hym flittith. 312 Who-so √æe peril know, and charge and fere That is in the, thogh √æou at therthe lay, He wold√´ noght the vp areyse or rere, But lat √æe ly√´ stille, and go his way. ffor sooth is √æis, and hath &amp; schal ben ay, This world√´s hook, enuye hath to his bayt, And ay hath hye degree sore in a-wayt.‚Äù 313 Now, noble princ√´, thogh I be nat wys, Wel-willed am I, as I first yow tolde; In √æe name of ihesu, wirke after √æe auys That I compyle oute of this auctours olde.

[¬ß 2 ON A KING'S KEEPING HIS CORONATION OATHS; AND ON TRUTH AND CAUTIOUS SPEECH.] 314 Tho oth√´s that at your creac√Øoun Shul thurgh your tong√´ passe, hem wel obserue; Lat no col√≥ur√´d excusac√Øoun Yow mak√´ fro hem slippe aside or swerue; Holde vp hir lyf, lat hem nat in yow sterue; It is nat knyghtly from an oth to varie; A kyng of trouth, oweth bene exemplarie. 315 Lo! thus this Aristotle in his book seith To Alisandre, and to be war hym bit, That he ne breke his bond√´s ne his feith, ffor vn-to folke vntrew√´ longith it; He seith √æat grac√´ nat in hym abit, But wikked ende and cursid √°uenture Hym folowith, that forswere hym hath no cure. 316 By feith, is maad the congregac√Øoun Of peple, and of cit√®s enhabitynge; By feith, han kyng√´s dominac√Øoun; ffeith causith eek of men √æe comunynge; Castelx, by feith, dreden non √°ssailynge, By feith, √æe Citees standen vnwerr√©yed, And kyng√´s of hir soget? ben obeyed. 317 Who leeseth feith, gretter thyng may non leese. Or a man speke, or bynde hym by his sel, And hath his ful lib√©rte, and may cheese What he do schal, hym oghte auyse hym wel Or he promette; and heet√´ naght a deel By word ne bond, but if he wole it laste; ffor who so dooth, schal smerten at √æe laste. 318 Litel encheson ha√æ he for to speke, To whos word√´s is ?euen no credence: Perillous is, a man his feith to breke. ffeith, by necessite ne indigence Naght artid is: disceyt, &amp; apparence Of trouthe outward, and inward fikilnesse, Bulteth out schame, and cause√æ gret smartnesse. 319 What was √æe cause of √æe destrucc√Øoun Of √æe peple of Scites &amp; of Arabiee, But for hir kyng√´s, in decepcioun Of men and Citees nyh to hir contre, Hir othis vseden, by sotilte Brekyng√´ bond√´s √æat stablisshed were Mankynde to profit√´, and not to dere? 320 And for √æat synn√´, godd√´s ri?twisnesse, That punnysshith falshood and trecherie, Nat myghte hem suffre endure in √æat woodnesse; But √æey destroyed were, it is no lye. Vntrouthe, allas! √æe ordre of chyualrie Dampneth it; thogh √æat √æe persone it vse, Knyghthode itself mot algate it refuse. 321 To god truste I, no lord in al √æis lond Is gilty of √æat inconuenience; ffy! what? a lord breke his byheste or bond? Nay, god forbed√´ √æat that pestilence In a lord dwelle, or hold√´ residence; ffor if √æat he that wicked geste recette, By suche a lorde wole honour no thing sette. 322 Whan Marcus Regulus was, as I rede, Venqwissh√®d in a bataile of √æe see By hem of Cartage, hoom wi√æ hem √æey lede This prisoner; and aftir, sent was he By hem to Rom√´, his own√´ contre, Sworn to retourn√´ to Cartage ageyn, As tullius And eek seint Austyn seyn. 323 The caus√´ whi √æey hym to Rom√´ sente, Was for to do to Romayns hir message, Wityng of hem, if √æat √æey wolde Assente, That, syn ther wer√´ Romayns in cartage In prisoun, and Romayns hadde eek in cage Cartagiens, suffre hem at larg√´ goo, And √æe Romayns go schulden [fre] also. 324 Whan Marcus doon hadde as √æat he was bode, The senat axid hym what was his reed; And he answerde, and seid√´ √æus for gode:‚Äî ‚ÄúAl √æis, rede I, lat slepen, &amp; ben deed; It may by no way sinke in-to myn heed, That to vs Romayns were it couenable, Swiche an eschaung√´; but vnprofitable. 325 ‚ÄúWe Romayns √æat √æey han in prison loke, Ben but ?onge froth, vnlern√´d in batayle, And othir feble folk with age I-broke, Of whiche I am on; we may nat availe; Of vs no losse is; but with-outen faile, ?oure prisoners ben myghty men and wyse, And folk in arm√´s preeu√´d at deuyse.‚Äù 326 His freend√´s wolde han holde hym still√´ there, But thei nat myghte; he wolde alwey retourne; To breke his oth, his goost was ay in fere; He √æoghte noght in his contre soiourne. Do qwat hem list, whether thei glade or mourne, Vnto his foos as bliu√´ he hym dressith, And knewe wel to be deed, the book witn√©ssith. 327 He held it bette his oth for to obserue, And dye in honur, as √æat a knyght oghte, Than by peri√∫rie his lif for to preserue; Of suche vnknyghtly trikk√´s he nat roghte. I trow√´ now-a-day√´s, thogh men soghte, His heir ful hard were in √æis land to fynde; Men list not so ferforth to trouthe hem bynde. 328 ?it nat only to preyse is this Marcus ffor trouth√´, but eek, as it semeth me, His renoun oght√´ doubled ben, as √æus‚Äî Where as theschang√´ myghte han maad hym fre, Qwit of his foos prisoun, gretter cheerte He hadde of the profet vn√≠uersel Than of hym self: his deeth it preued wel. 329 Nota de Alexandri iuramento.Among√´s all√´ √æing√´s in a knyght, Trouthe is a √æing that he ne lakk√´ may, If his honur schal bere his heed vp right. (R) De iuramento regis Alexandri observato.Valerie tellith how, wi√æ greet array, Kyng Alisandre and his oost, on a day, Meeued of ire and mal√©ncolye, Vn-to a citee dressid hym in hye, 330 Which√´ √æat clept and called was Lapsat, Purp√≥synge bete it to √æe erthe adoun; And or √æat this kyng fully cam ther-at, Ther was a Philosophere in √æe toun,‚Äî A man of excellent discrec√Øoun, That to this kyng somtyme had maister be,‚Äî fful sore abasshed of him &amp; his meyne. 331 Out of √æe toun he spedde hym on his weie, As hastely as √æat he coude or myghte, Toward √æe kyng, of grace hym for to preie; And √°s swithe as √æe kyng hadde of hym sighte, He knewe him and his menynge; and on highte He seide him √æus: ‚Äúby √æe godd√´s I swere, Al √æi labour schal nat be worth a pere; 332 At √æi prayer√´ do wole I no √æing.‚Äù This Philosophre of his ooth took good hede, And seide, ‚Äúo worthy conquerour and kyng, Than prey I √æe, vnto the toun √æ√® spede, And it destroy√´ bothe in lengthe &amp; brede; Haue on it no pitee, but al doun caste; This pray I √æe, √æat may be done as faste.‚Äù 333 And whan √æe kyng his prayere vnderstood, Al his angir and his irrous talent Refreyn√®d he; he wold√´ for no good On √æe toun veng√´ him, as he had ment; He rathir chees be disobedient To his venge√°ble wil, and his oth kepe, Than be forsworn of √æat he swoor so depe. 334 Or a kyng swere, it is ful necessarie A-vise hym wel; for whan √æat it is past, He may his oth in no wise contrarie, If he of sham or repreef be agast. A kyng ow√©th of word be stid√´fast; No thing byhet√´, but he it perfourme, If he wole hym vnto his state conforme. 335 Crisostomus super Matthaeum omelia 12. Nisi consuetudo interdicatur non possunt amputari periuria.

In Canone xxij. q. ijA greet clerk, whiche clept is Crisostomus, Where he of the matir of sweryng tretith, Thyse arn the word√´s that he writ to vs:‚Äî ‚ÄúWhat man √æe custume of oth√´s nat letith, In sweryng oft√´, what he seith forgetith; Vsage of othes, of periurie is cause.‚Äù And more he seith eke in √æe sam√´ clause. 336 He seith, ‚Äúperiurie engendrid is of othis; ffor right as he √æat custumably Clappith and ianglith, and to stint loth is, Moot othir whil√´ speke vnsittyngly, Right so, vsage of swering, enemy To trouthe is, and makith men hem forswere;‚Äù Isti tres.

Vnsittynge is to swere in any wise, B√∫t it be causid of necessite; ffor, as he sei√æ, and othir clerkis wise, A kyng or princes word oght√´ suffise Wel mor√´ than, oghte a march√°ntes oth, And to go ther ageyn be mor√´ loth. 339 And syn a princes oth, or his promesse, Whan √æei nat holden ben, him dishonure, His lettre and seel, whiche more open witnesse Beren than √æei, good is take hede and cure That √æei be kept; writing√´ wil endure; [R] Litera scripta manet. What a man is, it prest is for to preue; Outhir, honure it shal him, or repreue. 340 Now if it happe, as it ha√æ happed ofte, A kyng in ned√´ borwe of his march√°ntis, Greet wisdom were it tret√´ faire &amp; softe, And holde hem tru√´ly her couenantis; ffor trust it wel, whan hir cou√©nant is Nat to hem kept, as √æat hir bonde requerith, The kyng ha√æ schame, and eke it hem mys-cherith. 341 Loth wolde hem ben eft-son√´s for to lene; He √æat is brent, men seyn, dredith √æe fire.

[¬ß 5. DE PIETATE.] 429 Pitee, naght ell√´s is, to vndirstonde, But good wille inward of deb√≥nair hert, And outhewarde spech, and werk of man, to fonde To help him √æat men sen in meschif smert. Men selde him seen in-to wykk√Ωd de√æ stert, √ûat pitous is; but √æei han cruel de√æ Often whos cruelte cruelly sleth. 430 Refert Horosius qualiter quidam artifex subtilis puniebatur per artem propriam.Whilom √æer was a tyraunt dispitouse, √ûat so delited him in cruelte, √ûat of no √æing was he so d√©sirous. Now shope it so, a man √æat to pyte ffo was, and frende vnto iniquite, A sotel werkeman in craft of metal, Wrought in √æis wyse as I yow tell√´ shal. 431 His lorde √æe king he √æought√´ plese and glade, And craft√´ly he made a bol of bras, And in √æe syde of it he slily made A litel wyket, √æat ordeyn√´d was To r√©ceyue hem √æat stode in de√æ√´s case, Vndir √æe which men shulden sharpe fire make, Tho folk to de√æ√´ for to brenne &amp; bake. 432 And ?it more-ouer, √æe kyng for to meve The lesse vnto pitee, it made was so By sotil art √æe dampn√´d folk to greve √ûat whan to crye, hem c√≥mpellyd hir woo, Hir woys was lyke a bol√´s euer-mo, And nothyng lyke a mannys voise in soun, As √æe scriptur√´ maketh menc√Øoun. 433 But our lord god, of pite √æe auctour, Displesid with √æis cruel ordinaunce, Swich rewarde shape vnto this losengeour, √ûat it abatid al his countenaunce; And for to preue his fendely purueaunce, How sharp it was, &amp; coud√´ folk distreyne, The first he was √æat entryd in √æat peyne. 434 ffor whan √æe kyng, his cruel werk had seyne, √ûe craft of it commendith he ful wele; But √æe entent he fully helde a-gayne, And seyd√´, ‚Äú√æou √æat art mor√´ cruel Than I, √æe maydenhede of this Iuel Shalt preue anone; √æis is my Iug√´ment.‚Äù And so as blyue he was √æer-in I-brent. 435 Men may sen here, how fauel hym enclyneth Ay to his lordys lust, what so it be; Contra blanditores. Vnto √æat ende he bysieth hym and clynyth, And no considerac√Øoun hath he, Thogh it be harm√´ to his lordys degre, Or a-geyn feith, honour, or conc√Øence; In fals plesaunce is al his diligence. 436 To what √æing it be, if it his lorde lyke, He him conformyth; he neuer denyeth His lord√´s resouns, but a √æank to pike, His lordys wil and witte he iustifieth; Whil fauel liue√æ, no fals conseil dieth; ffauel is wedded to plesaunt deseyt, And in √æat wedlok trewe is his conceite. 437 Grounde of treson, o √æou cursyd fauel! How long√´ shalt √æou be a potestate? In lord√´s courtes √æou pleyest √æi parcel, So √æat it strecchith to √æi lordys mate; ffor √æu hast neuer √æi lordys estate To hert√´ chere, but al √æi bysynesse Is for √æi lucre, and √æi cofres warmnesse. 438 Dicit Seneca de quibusdam qui Neronem sequebantur. Mel musce sequuntur, cadauera lupi; predam sequitur ista turba non hominem.ffauel was neuer frendly, man vnto; lord√´s, beth ware! it nedith trew√´lye.

But of al √æis now make I here an ende, And to my tale of pite wol I wende. 444 A Princ√´ mot be of condicioun Pitouse, and his angir refreyne, &amp; ire, Aristoteles, in principum regimine, capitulo de Regis prouidencia.

De pietate cesaris imperatoris.Whan Cesar, emperour, eek on a day Pompey√´ saw biforn hym lad &amp; bounde, Cesar in ter√´s salt√´ gan habounde. 465 De pietate Alexandri.Whan Alisaundre eek, as Vallerie ha√æ told, Was, in a tyme, in √æe feld wi√æ his host, An ag√´d knyght of his, for verray cold, His lyfly myght he loren hadde al-moost, So greuous tempest tho fil in √æat coost; And whan √æis wor√æy kyng √æis hadde aspied, Out of his see he roos, and to hym hied, 466 And by the hand √æis old√´ knyght he took, Confortynge hym [right] in his beste manere, And ledde hym to his tente, as seith √æe book, And in his real seege and his chaiere As blyue hym sett√´: √æus may kyng√´s leere, Distress√´d knyghtes to help√´ and releeue: To take ensample of √æis, it schal noght greue. 467 What wonder was it, thogh √æat knyght√´s tho Desir√´den so noble princ√´ serue, Syn √æat hym leuer was for to for-go His dignite, and hir hel√æ√´ conserue, Than his estat keepe, and hym suffre sterue?

[¬ß 6.] De Misericordia. 474 Mercy, aftir √æe worde of seynt Austyn, Augustinus dicit, quod misericordia est aliene miserie ex corde vera compassio, &amp; hec vertus consistit in duobus, scilicet, dando &amp; dimittendo. Of herte is a verray compass√Øoun Of othir menys harm, and √æat comth yn By gyfte of god, and by remiss√Øoun; As, if ini√∫rie or oppressioun Be doon to vs, √æat gilt for-yeue vs oghte, ffor loue of crist, √æat, by deth, our lif boghte. 475 Who-so, wronge to hym do√∂n, wole for-yeue, Matthaei vij?. Qui enim dimittit iniuriam, &amp; si peccauerit ipse, dimittetur ei. His synn√´ schal to hym for-yeuen be; Thogh √æat he no √æing of his good√´s yeue, Vnde dominus in euangelio: Date &amp; dabitur vobis; dimitte &amp; dimitetur vobis; sed qui dimittit &amp; non dat, &amp; si plene non operatus est, eam meliorem tamen partem tenet misericordie. The better part yit of mercy halt he; Thus fynde I writen of auctorite: but fully may √æere no man do mercy, But if √æat he releu√´ √æe nedy. 476 Thogh √æat a man be sobre, chaast, &amp; trewe, Ambrosius. Quis fidelis sit, sobrius &amp; castus &amp; aliis vertutibus oneratus, si tamen misericors non est misericordiam non meritur. Dicit enim Apostolus Iacobus ij?. Iudicium sine misericordia illi qui non facit misericordiam. And be wi√æ many an hy vertu endow√´d, And yeue, and naght for-yeue, it schal hym rewe: Where as oure werkes most√´ ben avow√´d, The vnmerci√°ble schal be disallow√´d: Who naght for?eueth, mercy dooth he non; And mercyles man, mercy schal for-gon. 477 Mercy, crist caus√´d to ben incarnate, And humbled hym to take oure bre√æerhede. God in-mortel, rewynge oure seek estate, Mortel be-cam, to purge oure synful dede; Hym lothid naght his precious body sprede Vpon √æe croys, this lord benyngne and good; He wroot oure chartre of mercy with his blood. 478 Of hym, his handwerk and his cr√´ature, ffor to be merciable, aright may lerne; This lyf present schul but a whil√´ dure, And lastynge it, your mercy naght ne werne, O worthy princ√´, for to god eterne It ful plesant is; dooth your mercy here; ffor to late is, aftir ye goo to beere. 479 De misericordia Iohannis ducis lancastrie, (cuius anime propicietur deus!) &amp; de misericordia domini nostri Regis henrici, filii sui.Take hede, exc√©llent prince, of your graunt-syre, How in his werk√´s he was merci√°ble; He √æat for mercy dyd√´, qwyte his hire! He neuere was, in al his lyf, venge√°ble, But ay for-yaf the gylty and coup√°ble. Our lig√´ lord your fadir, dith √æe same; Now folwe hem two, my lord, in goddis name! 480 They often hadd√´ gret cause hem to venge, But hir spiritis b√©nigne and pesible Thoghten √æat craft vnlusty and alenge, And f√≥rbaar it; √æei knewe it vnlisible. To mercy were hir hert√´s ay flexible; ffor-why with mercy god schal qwyte hem wel, Beati misericordes &amp;c.Aftir √æe word√´s write in √æe gospell. 481 It is to leue and deme, if a kyng schyne In vertu, √æat his son√´ schuld√´ sue, And to his fadris maner√´s enclyne, And wykked teich√´s and vices eschue: Thus oghte it be, this to nat√∫re is due. He mot considre of whom he took hys kynde, And folwe his vertu, as men writen fynde. 482 He moost is like to god, as seith Bernard, Ait beatus Bernardus, ‚ÄòIlle maxime deum imitat, qui nichil iudicauerit preciosius quam misereri.‚Äô √ûat holdeth no √æing mor√´ precious Than to be merciful; it is ful hard To lakk√´ mercy and ben vnpitous. ‚ÄúMercy wole I,‚Äù seith oure lord glorious; Matthaei. ij. clamauit deus, misericordiam volo; qui quod vult deus, deo negat, a deo sibi quod desiderat, vult negari. He √æat denyeth god, √æ√°t he wolde haue, God nayte hym schal, √æat he wil axe or craue. 483 Senek seith how √æe kyng and √æe ledere [R, om.

What √æing it be √æat harmeth man or greueth, By goodnesse ouercome it paciently; No seint to heuene comyth, as rede I, But by kepynge of pac√Øence, and how Scriptum est, Nemo quidem sanctorum ad celestem gloriam, nisi pacienciam seruando peruenit.

Look√´ what √æing may √æe body profite, And √æe soule in √æe sam√´ schal delite; What √æing √æat it distempereth &amp; dissesith, The soule it hurteth, for it god displesith. 554 Wratth√´, √æe body of man inward fretith, And god √æer-wi√æ displesid is ful sore; Envie also of god and man hir getith Lik thank and ese, and schal do euermore; And leccherie, as techi√æ smert√´s lore, The body wastith, and √æe soul√´ grevith, And food√´ delicat √æerto man meevith. 555 Be-holde also, whan √æat √æe paunche is ful, A fum√´ clymbith vp in-to √æe heed, And maki√æ a man al lustles and al dul; He vexith heuy as a peece of leed. Who-so √æat √æan wold√´ yeue him reed To looke in a book of deuoc√Øoun, I trowe in ydel were his moc√Øoun. 556 But conseil him to trotte vnto √æe wyn, And, for al his excesse and his outrage, He √æerto wole assent√´ wel and fyn, And √æer√´ wole he outen his lang√°ge; And do to Bachus and Venus hom√°ge; ffor non of hem two can be wel from othir, Thei loue as vel as doth sustir &amp; brothir. 557 And aftir moot he rown√´ with a pilwe, His lyfles resouns √æer√´ to despende. We beest√´s resonable, allas! whi wil we Ageyn resoun werrye, and hir offende? O good√´ god! thy grac√´ to vs sende, That we may fle suche superfluite, And al √æing that is foo to chastite! [¬ß 9.] De Regis Magnanimitate. 558 Off magnanimite now wole I trete, √ûat is to seyn, strong herte or grete corage, Whiche in knyghthode ha√æ stablisshed hir sete. Ye, gracious Prince, of blode and of lynage Descendid ben, to haue it in vsage; Mars ha√æ euer ben frend to ?our wor√æi lyne; Ye moot of kynd√´ to manhode enclyne. 559 He √æat is strong of corage and of herte,‚Äî Yf he lordschip√´s haue, or grete richesse, Or √æat fortun√´s stynge hym ouerthwerte,‚Äî Is alwey on in welthe and in distresse; He, lucre and los, weyeth in euenesse; He setti√æ litel by good temperel; How √æe worlde schape, he taki√æ it ay wel. 560 But for to speke of corage of a kyng, he of his peple owe√æ be so cheer, That hir profet he moot for any √æing Promot√´ wit his myght and his power. And for his reme and him take him so neer, That vnto √æe peril√´s of bataille He moot him putt√´, and in hem trauaylle, 561 And in diffense of holy chirche also, And for oure feith putte him in iupartye; Othir causes ben ther but few√´ mo, Whi a kyng aughte to batayl√´ hym hye, And in tho causes drede him not to dye, But kythe hym a good knyght a-mong his foos: Thus wonne is magnanymyte√´s loos. 562 Right as we seen by reson and nat√∫re, Part of mannys body diffendeth al; As an arme putte√æ him in √°uenture ffor √æe body, √æat nat perische it schal, Right so a kyng√´s chert√´ special, If he god loue, and his peple, &amp; his land, Whan nede is, mot diffende hem wi√æ his hande. 563 Thoru? grete emprises wonne is hy renoun; Renoun is call√´d glorie &amp; honour; Magnanimite ha√æ √æis condic√Øoun, That in bataile, how scharp √æat be √æe stour, Hym leuere is to suffre deth√´s schour, Than cowardly and scham√´fully flee, So manly of cur√°ge and herte is he. 564 He medleth neuere but of √æing√´s grete, And hye, and vertuous; he neuere is meeved With smal√´ thing√´s, as the book√´s trete; And swiche a drede ha√æ for to be repreued, That vnto √æing √æat may be knowe or preued ffor vilonous, or foul, or r√©preeu√°ble, He neuere obeie√æ, √æis kny?t honur√°ble. 565 Thane I rede of oon clepet Coadrus, De magnanimitate Coadri Principis excercitus atheniensis. That was prince of √æe oost of Athinyens, How in √æe feeld a law√´ made was √æus Twixt his host and hem of Polipolens‚Äî With triumph√´ schuld√´ √æat part go √æens, Whos duc or Princ√´ were vnarm√´d slawe In habit straung√´; lo! swiche was √æe lawe. 566 Him leuer was him selfen for to dye, And his men liu√´, √æan se hem be-stad So streit√´, √æat by violent maistrie His foos hadde hem venqwissht or ouer-lad. A-day√´s now is non swiche chierte had; Algat√´s I ne can nat seen it vsid, Knyght√´s ben loth √æerof to ben accused. 567 O worthi Prince! I truste in ?our manhode, Medlid wi√æ prudence and discrec√Øoun, That ?e schulle mak√´ many a kny?tly rode, And √æe pride of oure foos thristen adoun. Manhode and witt conqu√©ren hy renoun; And qwo-so lakki√æ outhir of √æe tweyne, Of arm√´s wanti√æ √æe brid√©l and reyne. 568 Yf √æe ordre of knyghthode be resceyu√´d, fful nedeful is a man to be prudent, Ell√´s √æat host may lightly be disceyu√´d That is vnto his gouernance I-bent; Presumpc√Øon is disobedient Al day, and by wisdom not will him gie, All iustifieth his obst√Ωnacie. 569 Ofte in batail√´s hath be seen or this, A syd√´ suffred hath discomfiture, Whiche an vnwys heed gi√´d hath amys. What knyght on hym takith √æat charge or cure, If he in knyghtly honur schal endure, Him oghte endow√´d ben of sapience, And haue in arm√´s greet experience. 570 Experience and art in a bataille, Of √æe prudent knyght mor√´ may profite, Than hardinesse or forc√´ may auaille Of him √æat √æerof knowe√æ noght or lite. Hardinesse, in effecte, nat worth a myte Is to victorious conclus√Øoun, But wi√æ hym medle art, wit, and resoun. 571 Whan reueled wit and manly hardynesse Ben knytte to-gidre, as ?ok of mariage, Ther folowe√æ of vict√≥rie √æe swetnesse; ffor to sette on hym whettith his cor√°ge, And wit restreyne his wil can &amp; aswage In tym√´ du√´, and in couen√°ble; And thus tho two ioynt ben ful profitable. 572 But be a knyght wys or corag√´ous, Or haue hem bothe at on√®s at his lust, If √æat his herte of good be d√©sirous, On his manhode is ther but litel trust. God graunt√´ knyght√®s rubbe away the rust Of couetise, if it hir hert√´s cancre, And graunte hem picche in souffisance hir ancre. [¬ß 10.] Quod rex non debet felicitatem suam ponere in diuiciis. 573 Now, for as moche as magnanymyte May no foot holde, if √æat √æe herte of man Gretly vnto richesse enclyn√´d be, Than is √æe best√´ reed √æat I see can, A kyng √æer-in delyte hym naght; for whan His herte is in √æat vic√´ ficched hye, Smal prowesse in hym wole it signifie. 574 And if a kyng√´s honour schal be queynt With a foul and a wrecched couetise, His peples trust in hym schal be ful feynt; A kyng may naght gou√©rne hym in √æat wise; The coueitous may do no gret emprise; ffor whan his hert√´ lurketh in his cofre, His body to batayle he dar not profre. 575 If √æat a kyng sette his felicite Principally on rychesse &amp; moneye, His peple it torne√æ to aduersite, ffor he ne rekke√æ in what wise or weye He pile hem: allas! √æat kyng√´s nobleye Turn√´ schulde into style of tirranye! Allas! the peril, harme, and vilenye! 576 God I byseeche, your hert to enlumyne, Grac√Øous princ√´, √æat √æe feend our foo No power hau√´ so your hert√´ myne, But of his grac√´ kep√´ yow ther-fro, And grant√´ yow to gouern√´ yow so As most holsom is for bod√Ω and soule; That desire I, by God and by seynt Poule. 577 Qualiter Marcus Curcius dixit, quod mallet diuites habere suo mandato obedientes, quam diues ipsemet esse.Whan that Marcus Curcius, a Romeyn, Vnto √æe Beneventans seeg√´ leide, ffor he was poore, as √æat √æey herd√´ seyn, They a grete somme of gold hym sente, &amp; preyde Withdrawe his seege; and he answerde and seide, ‚ÄúTo hem retourneth / √æat yow hider sente, And thus to hem declareth myn entente: 578 ‚ÄúSeye hem, Marcus Curc√Øus leuer is Rich√´ men haue at his command√´ment, Than to be riche hym-self; tell√´ hem this: He may with gold not be corrupt, ne blent; Of force of men eek, √æey ben impotent To venqwisshe hym; for √æere hir art schal faile, Hir blynd√´ profers schal hem noght auaile.‚Äù 579 To Alisaundre, as I schal tellen here, A knyght, whiche was vnto hym spec√Øal, Refert Valerius qualiter quidam miles Alexandri arguebat eum de sua cupiditate. Thus spake, and blamed hym in √æis manere: He seide, ‚Äúif oure godd√´s thy body smal, To thi gredy desire had maad egal, Al √æe world hadd√´ nou?t be s√∫ffisant To han receyu√´d so large a Geaunt. 580 ‚Äúffor with √æi ri?t honde, thow √æe orient Shuldest han touchid, I am sure of √æat; And with √æi list honde, eke √æe occident; Now, syn √æat √æy body answ√©rith nat Vnto √æi will√´, what may I sey, what? Ethir √æou art a man, or god, or nou?t; Mechil of √æe, merueyle I in my √æought. 581 ‚ÄúIf √æou be god, thow folow most his trace, And nou?t men of her gode robbe or be-reue, But hem releue, &amp; do hem ese and grace. If √æou be man, considere eke, by thy leue, √ûou art mort√©l, √æou mayst be dede or eue. If √æou be no √æing, √æe putte out of mynde, Os he √æat is of no nature or kynde. 582 ‚ÄúTher is no hye estate so sadde and stable, Remembre wele, lat it nat be for-?ete, But he to falle in perile is ful able. By deeth, a leon maad is bridd√´s mete, And best√´s also his flessh gnawe &amp; frete.‚Äù √ûe answere of √æe kyng, naught haue I herde; My booke not telleth how he was answerde. 583 Pauper diogenes dicior erat Alexandro.Senek seith, the po√´r Diogenes, Kyng Alisandre in richess√´ past, ffor he ne my?t, as he seith dout√´les, ?eue hym so mochil golde, ne on hym cast, As he refus√´ wolde: O! at the last, Men √æinke shullen √æei to mochil haue had, And of √æis worldys muk be ful vnglad. 584 Desire of good, a king mot leye apart, And peyne him to purch√°se him a good fame; Ther-in lat him laboure, and doon his art; Ther nys no √æing vnto a worthi name; And if a kyng it lakke, it were his shame, And shame is contrarie vnto worthynesse; Gode lose desserued, is grettest richesse. 585 And for largess√´ wynne√æ gode renoun, Ther-of √æink I now, to trete a litil stounde; A prince &amp; kyng of al a regioun Mot avaric√´ thrist a-doune to grounde; To hym √æat lith in hell√´ depe I-bounde, The, auarice, by-tak√´ I to kepe; Thow pyn√´peny, ther ay mot √æou slepe! 586 Golde wolde, for false enprisonyng, a writ Sue agayn √æe, if he at larg√´ were; But he so fast is in √æi cofre shit, He may not out.

[¬ß 11.] De Virtute Largitatis, &amp; De Vicio Prodigalitatis. 590 Aristoteles de regimine principum, capitulo de largitate. ‚ÄòSi vis virtutem largitatis adquirere, considera posse tuum, tempora necessitatis &amp; merita hominis,‚Äô &amp;c. Aristotil, of largesse, telleth this: Who vertuously larg√´ list to be, Concider first of what power he is, And eke the tym√´s of necessite; And as √æe men disseruen, so be fre; Yif in mesure vn-to √æe indigent And the worthi, and √æat is wel dispent. 591 [R, om. H] Qui aliter dat, regulam excedit largitatis. Qui largiter bona sua hominibus non indigentibus nulla; et quicquid datur indignis perditur; et qui fundit ultra modum diuicias suas, cito veniet ad amara litora paupertatis, et assimilatur illi qui victoriam super se dat inimicis suis &amp;c.And who doth othir wyse in his ?euyng, Largesses rul√´ passith and excedith; He nouther worthi is √æank ne preysyng, That to hym √æat no nede hath, ?ift√´s bedith. Of verray folye also it procedith To ?eu√´ the onworthi; for √æat cost All mysse dispendid is, for it is lost. 592 And he √æat d√≠spendith out of mes√∫re Shal tast a-none pou√©rtes bitternesse; ffoole largesse is ther-to a verray lure. Of hem also he berith the lyknesse, That on him self, as √æe booke berith witnesse, Vict√≥rie ?eueth to his enemys; And he √æat so dispendith, is not wyse. 593 Largess√´ stant noght in mochil ?euynge, But it is aftir √æe wille &amp; √æe myght Of hym √æat ?eueth aftir his hauynge; ffor it may som tyme happ√´ √æat a wight, Which of richess√´ berith nat but light, ?eueth but smal; &amp; ?it larger is he Than he √æat ?eueth gretter quantite. 594 Aftir his goode, man may ?eue &amp; dispende Wher as nede is; but he √æat al dispendith, And wastith al, shal him-selue first offende. ffool√´ largesse al day wrycch√©dly endith; Many a man hir foule outrag√´ shendith; But of largesse is goode √æe gouernaunce; Both√´ to god and man it is plesaunce. 595 Evene as a mann√´s blood is norisshyng To his body, if it corrupt naght be, So ben richesses to soul√´s feedynge Holsom, if √æei, were-as necessite Axith, despent ben, and also if he Whiche √æat hem wan, gat hem with ri?twisnesse; ffor heuene and helle is got√´ by richesse. 596 A crookid hors neuere is the bet entecched, Al-√æogh his bridel glistre of gold, and schyne; Right so a man √æat vicious is, &amp; wrecched, And his rich√©sses gote ha√æ of rapyne, And also euele as man can √Ωmagyne, Despendith hem / naght for hem √æe bet is, But mochil wers; good is take hede of √æis. 597 He √æat his flesche dispendith, and his blood, Mi lorde, in ?our seruice, him ?ift√´s bede; There is largess√´ mesur√°ble good; A kyng so bounde is, he moot doo so nede; Seruice vnquyt and murdre, it is no drede, As clerkes writen, and desheritaunce, Bifore al-mighty god auxen vengeaunce. 598 Of fool largess√´ wole I talke a space; How it befil, I not in what contree, But √æere was oon named Iohn of Canace, A rich√´ man, &amp; two dou?tres had he, That to two worthy men of a Citee He wedded leet; and √æer√´ was gladnesse And reuel, mor√´ than I can expresse. 599 The fadir, his doughtres and hir husbondes Loued ful wele, and had hem leef &amp; dere; Tyme to tyme he ?af hem with his hondes Of his goode passyngly; &amp; √æei swich chere Him made, &amp; were of so plesant manere √ûat he ne wist how be bettre at ese, √ûei couden hym so wele cheryssh &amp; please. 600 ffor he as mochil hauntid in partie Hir house, as √æat he did his own√´ house; √ûei held hym vp so with her flaterye, That of dispens he was outrag√´ous, And of good√´ √æei were ay desirous; Al √æat √æei axed, haden √æei redy; √ûei euer weren on hym right gredy. 601 √ûis sely man contynued his outr√°ge, Tyl al his good√´ was disshid &amp; goone; And when √æei felt his dispenses a-swage, Thei wax to him vnkynd√´ right anone; ffor after hadd√´ he cherishing none, Thei wery weren of his companye: And he was wyse, and shope a remedye. 602 He to a marchaunt goose, of his notise, Wich √æat his trusty frende had be ful ?ore, Besechyng hym, √æat he wold hym cheuyse Of ten thousand pounde, ne lenger ne more Than day√´s thre, and he wolde it restore At his day; √æis was done; √æe summe he hent, And to his own√´ house √æer-with he went. 603 And on the morn√´, prayde he to soupere His sonn√´s both &amp; his doughtres also. √ûei to him cam, with-owten any daungere: How √æat √æei ferden, lat I passe and goo; Thei ferden wel, with-outen word√´s moo; To his konyng, he grete disport hem made, He did his myght to chere hem, &amp; to glade. 604 Aftir souper, whan √æei hir tym√´ sye, √ûei toke her leue, &amp; home √æei wolde al-gate; And he answered, and seyde hem sekirly, ‚ÄúThis ny?t ye shul nat passe out of the gate; Your house is fer, and it is dyrke and late; Neuen it nat, for it shal nat be-tyde;‚Äù And so al ny?t he made hem to abyde. 605 The fadir log√´d hem, of sly purp√≥se, In a chambre next to his ioynyng; ffor by-twix hem nas √æer but a parclose Of bord√´, nau?t but of homly makyng; √ûurgh out √æe which, at many a chynnyng, In ech√´ chambre √æei myghten beholde, And see what othir dyden, if √æat √æei wolde. 606 I kan nat sey how √æei slepten √æat ny?t; Also it longith nat to my matere; But on √æe morw√´, at brod√´ day li?t The fadir roose; and for √æei shulden here What √æat he dyd, in a boystous manere Vnto his chist, which √æat three lokkys hadde, He went, and √æer-at wrested he ful sadde. 607 And when it was I-opned &amp; vnshytte, √ûe bagged gold by √æe marchaunt hym lent He hath vncofred, and streyte for√æ with it Vnto his beddis feete gone is &amp; went. What doth √æan √æis fel man &amp; right prudent, But out √æis golde on a tippet hath shotte, That in √æe bagg√´s left√´ √æere no grotte. 608 And al √æis did he noght but for a wyle, As √æat ye shul wel knowen aftirwarde; He shope his sonn√´s &amp; doughtres begile. His noys√´ made hem dressen hem vpwarde; √ûei cast her er√´s to his chambre-warde, And herd of golde √æe russhyng and the soun, As that he rud√´ly threwe hem adoun. 609 And to √æe parclos √æei hem hast and hye, To wyte and know√´ what her fadir wrought. In at √æe chynn√´s of √æe borde √æei prye, And sigh how he amonge √æe nobles sought If d√©fectif were any, as hem √æought; And on his nayl he threwe hem oft &amp; cast, And bagg√´d hem and cofred at the last; 610 And opned his dore, &amp; doun√´ goth his wey. And aftir blyue, out of hir bedde √æei rise, And cam doune eke: hir fadir √æanken √æey Of his gode cher√´, in hir best√´ wyse,‚Äî And al was for √æe gold√´s couetyse,‚Äî And to gon hoom, √æei axid of hym leue; Thei ben departyd, and √æei √æere hym leue. 611 Walkyng homward, √æei iangeld fast, &amp; speeke Of √æe golde which √æei sey hir fadir haue.

When he sey √æe tyme of his d√©partyng, His son√´s and his doughtres did he calle, And in this wise he spak√´ to hem alle: 618 ‚ÄúNat purpose I make othir testament, But of √æat is in my strong chist I-bounde; And ri?t anone, or I be henn√´s hent, An hundred pound of nobles gode and rounde, Takith to prechours; tarryeth it no stounde; An hundred pound eke to √æe frer√´s grey, And carm√´s fifty: tarrye it nought, I sey. 619 ‚ÄúAnd when I buried am, of hem the keyes Of my chist takith, for √æat √æei hem kepe; By euery key√´ writen ben the weyes Of my wille.‚Äù √æis golde was nat suffred slepe; It was anone dalt, for hir hertis depe Stak in his bounden cofre, and al hir hope Was god√´ bagges √æerin for to grope. 620 To euery chirche and recluse of √æe toune, Bad hem eeke of golde ?eue a quantite: Al as he bad, √æei weren prest and boune, And did it blyu√´; but, so mot I the, fful slily he disceyuyd √æis meyne, His sonn√´s and his doughtres bo√æ, I mene; Hir berd√´s shau√´d he right smothe &amp; clene. 621 When he was dede, and his ex√©quies do, Solenily √æei to √æe frer√´s ?ide, And bad √æo keyes delyuere hem vn-to; And as √æat √æei hem beden, so √æei dide.

Eek sche obserueth so wele trouth√´s style, And √æerto can so wel her tonge affyle, That, lest √æe fauour of frendschip√´s corde, Othir √æan trouth√´ can sche not recorde. 683 Sche b√Ω-heetith by good avis√´ment, And ?eueth mor√´ √æan hir list promette; Scho yeueth t√≥ men eek command√´ment ‚ÄòNaght in fortune truste, or by hir sette; And al √æe truste, out of hir hert√´ schette, Of myght of worldly dominac√Øoun:‚Äô Vertu gyeth hir operac√Øoun. 684 Prudence hath leuer lou√´d be √æan drad; Ther may no prince in his estate endure, Ne ther-yn any whil√´ stand√´ sad, But he be lou√´d; f√≥r loue is armure Of seur√´te. o! take on yow √æe cure, Excellent princ√´, lou√´ to embrace, And √æan your herte is sette in siker place. 685 Now, if √æat ye graunten by your patente To your seruaunt√´s a yeerly guerdoun, Crist scheeld√´ √æat your wil or your entente Be sette to maken a restriccioun Of pai√´ment; for √æat condic√Øoun Exile√æ √æ√© peples beneuolence, And kyndele√æ hate vndir priue scilence. 686 Beeth wel avis√´d, or your graunt out go, How ye √æat charg√´ may performe and bere; Whan it is past, obserue it wel also, ffor ell√´s wole it yow annoye and dere; ffor your honur it muchel bettre were, No graunt to graunt at al, √æan √æat your graunt Yow preeue a brekere of a couenaunt. 687 He √æat is lou√´d, men drede hym offende; But he √æat drad, &amp; naght by-lou√´d is, As Tull√Øus seith, lightly may descende, And √æe lordschip√´ lees√´ √æat was his; And Senek also seith as touchyng √æis, The sogett hateth whom he ha√æ in drede; And hate is hard, if it his venym schede. 688 Was neuere dred√´ yit a good wardeyn, To hold√´ lordschepe in his sikernesse, But only loue is √æing most souereyn; Loue is norice of wel√æe and of gladnesse, But out of lou√´ sprynge√æ ferdfulnesse, And feere is good, whiche √æat on loue groundeth, But othir feer√´ naght heli√æ, but woundeth. 689 Lou√´, withouten a good gouernaille, A kyng ha√æ non; for thogh men no word seye, If he his peple oppresse, it is no faile They loue hym noght, in no manere of weie; They may his hest√´s outward wel obeie, But in hir hertes is smal obediaunce, And vnto god √æey c√≥mpleyne hir grevaunce. 690 And swich a kyng is naght prudent ne wys, That of his peple purchaseth hym hate, ffor loue excedith al tresour in prys; So hath it ben, and so be wole algate. Whan √æat rich√©sses ebben &amp; abbate, If loue endur√´, it may hym restore, And loue is goten by prud√©nces lore. 691 By wise conseil, settith your hy estat In swhiche an ordre as ye lyu√´ may Of your good propre, in reule moderat; Is it knyghtly lyue on rapyn√´? nay! ffor Crist√´s sak√´, so yow gyeth ay, As √æat may strecch√´ to your peples ese, And √æerwith-al ye schul god hily plese. 692 It apparteneth a kyng for to be Egidius in ij? parte j. libri politicorum: Aristoteles and Regem maxime spectat vt sit rex secundum rei veritatem. A kyng in verray soth and √©xist√©nce. A kyng, of office and of dignite The name is; he moot don his diligence His peple for to gy√´ by prud√©nce; ffor √æat he rule hem schuld√´ du√´ly, The stile of a ‚Äòkyng‚Äô he berith certeynly. 693 As an archer may naght his arwe schete Eodem capitulo: sicut sagittator non potest sagittam sufficienter dirigere in signum, nisi ipsum signum viderit, sic nec Rex &amp;c. Euene at a merk, b√∫t he √æe merk see, No mor√´ may a kyng, I yow byhete, Gouerne his peple in rigth and equitee, But by prud√©nce he reule his hyghe degree; If √æat be wel, his peple hath sikernesse Of reste and pees, wel√æe, ioy√´, and gladnesse. 694 Inicium sapiencie, timor domini.Bygynnynge of wisdom is, god to drede; What kyng √æat dredith god, is good and iust To his peple; bee√æ swiche, my lord, I rede! In loue and in awe of god, ficche√æ your lust; Than be ye wys, and √æan yow need√´s must, Aftir your worldly sceptre transit√≥rie, In heuene regne in p√©rpetuel glorie.

And be his witt neuere so good, he may Erre and mistake hym o√æer while among, Where-as good counsail may exclude a wrong. 696 Excellent princ√´, in axynge of reed, Descouere√æ naght your wille in no maneere; What √æat ye √æink√´ doo, lat it be deed As for √æe tym√´, lat no word appere; But what euery man seith, wel herkne &amp; here; And yit whan good counsail is yeuen yow, What ye do wol√´, kepe it close y-now 697 Til √æat yow lyk√´ p√°rforme it in dede; And if it schal be don, lat it noght tarie, ffor √æat is perillous with-out√´ drede; Ther is no √æing may make a lond myscarie Mor√´ than swiche delay; ful necess√°rie It is, a gode purpos parforme as bliue, As, if it naght be, out of mynde it dryue. 698 And if √æat √° man of symple degree, Or pore of birth, or ?onge, be wel conseile, Admytte his resoun and take it in gre: Why naght, my god√´ lorde? what shuld yow eyle?

OF PEACE.] 718 Scriptum est, Qui amplectitur pacem in mentis hospicio mansionem preparit Christo, &amp;c. leronimus: Qui sine pace est, christum non habet. apud christianos non qui patitur sed qui facit contumeliam miser est. Prouerbiarum 12?. Qui pacis ineunt consilia, sequitur eos gaudium. Ciprianus dicit, Sacrificium deo est pax nostra &amp; fraterna concordia. Touche I wol heere, of pees, a worde or two, As √æat scriptur√´s maken menc√Øoun, And √æan my boke is endid al, and do. To crist ordeyne√æ he a manc√Øoun, Which in his hert√´s habitac√Øoun Embraceth pees. wher pees is, crist is there, ffor crist nat lyst a-byden ell√´s-where. 719 A-mong√´s cristen folk, wreche is he none √ûat pac√Ø√©ntly suffreth a duresse; But sikirly a wrecch√´ is he one √ûat maki√æ strife; &amp; hym sueth gladnesse Which √æat of pees cons√©ilith √æe suernesse. Our pees also and concorde brothirly Is sacrific√´ to god √°l myghty. 720 Thyng√´s √æat leden men to pees be thre: Scriptum est, Tria sunt pacis subsidia &amp; ad pacem ducencia, scilicet conformitas in deo, humilitas in seipso, &amp; tranquillitas cum proximo, &amp;c. Conformyng in god; in our self humblesse; And with our neigh√´boures tranquillite. ffirst seye I √æat we moot our will√´s dresse, And hem conformen all√´ more &amp; lesse To goddis wil; al √æingis is in his myght, Sauf only √æat he m√°y done non vnright. 721 Euene as a man is euer in werre and strife, √ûat besieth hym withstande a man, which he Nat may; right so hathe he peisible lyfe Continuelly, whos will√´s fully be To godd√´s wille conformyng: o, pardee! [R] Iob iiij?? Quis resist it Deo, et pacem habuit? quasi diceret nullus. A-geyn god helpeth √æere no r√©sistence, So strong and my?ty is his excellence. 722 Humilite, to pees eke may men lede; Men say two gret√´ may nat in o sak; But symple humblesse is of such godely-hede, √ûat she of troubly hat√´ ha√æ no smak; She stryueth nat; of discorde hath she lak; She voyde and empty is of cruelte: Humble spirit desirith vnite. 723 The thrid is eke tranquillite of √æought, √ûat gydeth man to pees; for as a wight May in a bedde of √æorn√´s rest√´ noght, Ri?t so, who is with greuous √æought√´s twight, May with himself nor othir folk a-ri?t Hau√´ no pees; a man mot nedys smert Whan irous √æought√´s occupye his hert. 724 And euene as vppon a pillow softe, Man may him rest√´ wele, and take his ese, Ri?t so √æat lorde √æat sittith in heuen a-lofte, Hert√´ peisible can so like and plese, √ûat he wol entre √æ√©r-in, and it sese, Scriptum est, In pace factus est locus eius, &amp;c. [R] Est enim pax mala, que est vere paci contraria; &amp; hoc est quando corda sunt in mala concordancia, &amp;c. Talem pacem habuit Pilatus cum Herode, &amp;c.And occupie it as iust p√≥ssessoure; In place of pees, resteth our sav√Øour. 725 But al an othir pees √æer is also, Which is naght worth; it is envenymouse; ffor it is vnto verray pees a foo; Whan men in a purp√≥s malic√Øouse De tali pace loquitur psalmista, Zelam super iniquos pacem peccatorum videns.Acorden, √æ√°t pees is to god greuous: Swich pees was twix Her√≥des &amp; pilat; And in swich caas, pees is wers √æanne debat. 726 A feyn√´d pees, eeke is to pees verray, A foo; and swich was √æe pees of Iudas Kissyng crist. Lord! whedir √æat √æis day Any swich pees vs√´d is as √æat was! ?e, so I drede me, by seynt Thomas, The kus of Iudas is now wid√´ sprad, Tokenes of pees ben, but smal loue is had. 727 Men contrefete in wordis Tull√Øus, And folwe in werke Iudas or Genyloun; Many an hony worde and many a kus Et de tali pace loquitur psalmista. Qui loquuntur pacem cum proximo suo, mala autem, &amp;c.Ther is; but wayte on √æe conclus√Øoun, And pryue galle all turnyth vp-so-doun; Ther leueth naght of pees, but contenance, ffor al √æe peyntyd chere and daliance. 728 Ther is also a pees inordinat, Whan √æe grett√©r obeith to √æe lesse; As √æus, whan to his soget a prelat Obeyeth; and whan reson, √æe blyndnesse Sueth of sensualitees madnesse, Obeying it: al swich pees is haynous, ffor it is good√´ pees contrarious. 729 Right swich a pees, Adam had with Eue, Whan √æat he vnto hir desire obeyde; He was, per caas, adradd√´ for to greue; Where-for he did as √æat she to hym seide: Contra talem pacem loquitur christus, Matthaei 10. Non veni, inquit, pacem mittere, sed gladium. &amp;c. In √æat obedienc√´ he foleyde, ffor god hir him bytoke him to obeye; But I a-drad am √æat I √æus fer seye; 730 If √æat √æis come vnto the audience Of women, I am sure I shal be shent: ffor √æat I touche of swich obedience, Many a brow√´ shal on me be bent; Thei will√´ wayten been equipollent, And sumwhat mor√´, vnto hir housbondis, And sum men seyn swich vsage in √æis lond is. 731 And it no wonder is, as semeth me, Whan √æat I me be-√æought haue al aboute, √ûogh √æat wom√©n desiren souereynte, And hir housbond√´s mak√´ to hem loute; Thei made ware of a ribbe, it is no doute, Genesis 2?.

We cristen folk, with-inne vs and with-out, Haue so gret stryfe, √æat √æer may no pees rout. 746 The ryot √æat ha√æ ben with-in √æis lande Among our-self, many a wyntr√´s space, Hath to √æe swerd put many a thousand: The gredy hert, √æat wold√´ al embrace, With irous wil, and crabbed pal√´ face, And swypir feendly hand with strook venge√°ble, Ha√æ many a woman maad hem clo√æe in sable. 747 √ûis is no dout√´, √æat ambic√Øoun And couetys√´ fyre al √æis debate; Tho two be of wikk√©d condic√Øoun. No wight halt hym content of his estate; Euery man wilne√æ to ben √©xaltat; √ûogh he be gret, ?it hir√´ wolde he goo, And √æeis aren causes of our stryues &amp; woo. 748 Werr√´ within our-Iself is most harmf√∫l And perillous, &amp; most is a-gayn kynde. √ûer-with √æis land hath wrastled many a pul; √ûe smert is swich, it may nat out of mynde, ffor it ha√æ cast our welth√´ far be-hynde, And ferther wol√´, but thoo werr√´s stynt; No goode may come of werr√´s wrathful dynt. 749 Whil√´s √æat Romaynes were in hert al oon, And vndeuydid, al hool stode, √æei were Lord√´s of al √æe worlde; foo was √æer non Out-warde, as who seith, myght hem greue or dere; But al sauf welth√´ may men suffre and bere; With-Inne hym-self sprang such deuys√Øoun, √ûat it hem brought√´ to confusioun. 750 What causyd hir inw√°rd werre and rumour But aueric√´? she reft hem her wele; Whil√´s √æei had in cheerte and fauour Profit commun, thei hadden bi √æe stele Prosperite; but it a-way gan stele Whan √æei him drough to profyte singuler, And of profyt commun nat weren cheer. 751 Nota de Auaricia.By-hold how auaric√´ crepith inne, And kyndlith werre, and quenchi√æ vnite! O fauel! √æou myght√©st ben of hir kynne, ffor swich a breek√´-pees as √æat is she, Right swich a-nothir, may I nam√´ √æe; √ûou rekkest nat, ne dredest nat, to wende ffor muk to helle, vnto √æe ferthest ende. 752 This fauel is of pees a d√©stourbour; Twix god and mann√´s soule he werr√´ reisith; This worlde is blent by √æis dissymulour; Vert√∫ he blame√æ, √°nd vic√©s he preysith; Sore in √æe bowe of treccherye he teisyth; His shot is gay, but it is √©nvenymed; His fikil art may nat a-ryght be rymed. 753 Vertuouse trouth√´, hyd√´ √æou √æine heede! √ûou mayst as wele, thyn art may nat a-vayle; Out of √æis world√´s grace art √æou as dede: But fauel, traitour! √æi fals gouernaile Makith ful manny shipp√´s for to saile In-to √æi cofre; warme is √æine office; √ûat trouth√´ lesith, wynn√´ can √æi vice. 754 Alas! so manny a worthi clerk fam√≥use, In Oxinford, and in Cambrigge also, Stonde vn-avanc√´d, wher the viciouse ffauel hath chirches. &amp; preuendres, moo √ûan god is plesid with; alasse! of thoo √ûat weiuen vertu so to be promoted; And √æei helples, in whom vertu is rooted. 755 The knyght or sqwier, on √æat othir syde, Or Ieman, √æat ha√æ in pees or in werris Dispent with his lorde his blode, but he hyde √ûe trouth, and can currey fauel, he nat √æe nere is His lord√´s grace; and vn-trouth ful fer is ffrom him, √æat worthy corage hath hon√≥ured; Grace of his lorde by fauel is deu√≥ured. 756 Now vnto my mateere of werre inwarde Resort I; but to sek√´ stories olde Non nede is, syn √æis day sharp werre &amp; harde Is at √æe dore here, as men may be-holde: ffraunc√´, no wondir √æogh √æine hert√´ colde, And brenne also: swich is √æine agonye, Thi self manaseth √æi self for to dye. 757 Thi self destroye, and feble is √æi vict√≥rye!

O! now aday√´s is noon enemye Lyke oon √æat is to othir of blood√´ nye; Beth ware! correct it! lest men of yow seye, ‚Äòlo! whilom this was ffraunce of hye nobley!‚Äô 759 I am an Englyssh-man, &amp; am √æi foo, ffor √æou a foo art vnto my lyge√°nce; And yit myn hert√´ stuffid is with woo To see √æyn vnkyndly disseueraunce: Accordeth yow! girde√æ yow with suffraunce! Ye greu√´ god, and your-self harme &amp; shame, And your foos ther-of han disport &amp; game. 760 Alase! Also, √æe greet dissenc√Øoun, The pitous harme, √æe hat√´ful discorde, √ûat hath endur√´d twix √æis regioun And othir land√´s cristen! he, √æat lorde Of Remes al is √æe auctor of concorde And pees, sore is meeu√´d √æer-with; but we Naght dreden for to offend his mageste. 761 Off fraunce and englonde, o cristen princes, Syn √æat your style of worthynes is ronge Thurgh-out √æe world, in al √æe prouinces, If √æat of yow myght√´ be red or songe That ye were oon in herte, ther nys no tonge That myghte expresse, how profitable and good Vnto al peple it were of cristen blood. 762 Yeue hem ensamplen! ye ben hir mirrours; They folowen yow: what sorwe lamentable Is caus√´d of youre werr√´s scharp√´ schoures Ther wot no wight, it is irr√©parable! O noble cristen Princes honurable, ffor him √æat for yow suffred pass√Øoun, Of cristen blod, haue√æ compass√Øoun! 763 Allas! what peple ha√æ your werr√´ slayn!

The harm ne may nat rekened be, ne told; This werr√´ wexi√æ al to hoor and old. 764 To wynn√´ worldly tresour and richesse, Is of your strif √æe longe continuaunce; Wherby it semeth √æat ye han scantnesse Of good, or ye konne haue no s√∫ffisaunce Of plente; and if √æ√©r be h√°bundaunce In youre cofres, and in your hert√´s nede, Of lordly c√≥nceit may it not procede. 765 Whan Alisaundre deed was, and y-graue, And his toumbe √≥f gold wroght ful rich√´ly, As kyng√´s dignite wole axe and craue, Dyuerse philosophres droghen hem nygh Therto; and as oon of hem stood √æerby, he seid√´ √æus among √æe folk√´s alle:‚Äî ‚ÄúSee√æ swiche a chaunge is new√´ now byfalle! 766 ‚ÄúThis Alisaundre mad√´ yistirday Of gold his tresor, but gold maki√æ now Tresor of him, as ye be-hold√´ may.‚Äù An othir philosopher seide eek how ‚ÄúAl √æis world yistirday was nat y-now To stoppen Alisaundres couetise, And now thre elnes of clo√æ√´ him suffice.‚Äù 767 O worthi princes two, now taki√æ hede!

Suffiseth to your good, ye princes bo√æe; With pees and rest√´, arm√´ yow and clothe! 769 Whan ye haue stryue and foughten al your fille, Pees folwe moot; but good were it, or thanne, ffinis belli pax.

Christus dicit, ‚Äúego sum pax,‚Äù &amp;c. Expressith how crist √æus seide hir vnto: ‚ÄúI am pees verray; √æere I wole abide, Where as pees is; non o√æer wole I do. Of ffraunce and Eng√´lond √æe kyng√´s two, Si reges ffrancie &amp; Anglie voluerint habere pacem, ego dabo eis perpetuam pacem: sed pax vera non potest haberi, nisi veritas &amp; iusticia diligantur. Ideo quia alter Regum habet iusticiam, placet mihi quod per matrimonium fiat pax, &amp; sic regnum ad legittimum heredem poterit peruenire &amp;c. If √æei wole haue pees, pees perpetuel Thei schul han‚Äù; thus hir book sei√æ, woot I wel; 771 ‚ÄúBut verray pees may be had by no way, But if trouth√´ and Iustice lou√´d be; And for √æat √° kyng ha√æ right, forthi may By matrimoign√´ pees and vnite Ben had; crist√´s plesance is swiche; √æus he That right heir is, may √æe rem√´ reioyse, Cesynge al strif, debate, or werre, or noyse.‚Äù 772 Now syn √æe wey is open, as ye see, How pees to gete in vertuous manere, ffor loue of him √æat dide vppon √æe tree, And of Mary, his blysful modir dere, ffolwe√æ √æat way, and your strif leye on bere; Purchaseth pees by wey of mar√Øage, And ye √æerinne schul fynden auauntage. 773 Now, pees! approche, and dryue out werre &amp; strif! ffrenchepe! appere, and bannyssh√´ thow hate!
