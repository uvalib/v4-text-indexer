      <field name="fulltext">Select Passages, &amp;c. PSALM XVI. I, II Preserve me, O my God, from sin, In whom my trust hath ever been, And still shall ever be: My soul hath said unto the Lord, “Thou art my God, my works or word “Are nothing unto thee.” III, IV “All my delight is in my saints, “While each on earth for glory pants, “Resolv'd in grace t'excell; But they who serve another God, Forsake the Saviour's peaceful road, And bend their path to hell. V Their off'rings of unhallow'd blood, Presented to an idol-god, Shall ne'er my heart inflame; My feet shall never tread their steps, Nor shall my pure devoted lips Make mention of their name: VI, VII The Lord himself my portion is, My cup's replete, eternal bliss, Thou shalt my lot maintain; My lot is fall'n in that fair ground, Where mines of purest gold are found, And everlasting gain. VIII I thank thee, Lord, for all his grace, The warning-calls to seek his face, And flee the wrath to come; Tho' chasten'd in the night of fear, His sov'reign arm shall still be near To guard my spirit home. IX My God before me will I set, His word of promise meekly wait, The great, the effectual call, The Lord is now on my right-hand, And while by faith in him I stand, I know I shall not fall. X, IX Wherefore my glory shall rejoice, My heart right glad shall lift her voice, My flesh in faith assume: Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, Thy holy one permit to dwell Where hope can never come. XII Thou wilt the path of life display, My spirit teach the living way, Cast up by Jesu's pow'r; Delights supreme before thee stand, And streams of joy at thy right-hand Are found for evermore, GLORIA PATRI. All hail! the mystic three in one! Shout seraphs that surround his throne, One God o'er all supreme! Of those, whom feebler strains employ, With saints that drink a brighter joy, The co-eternal theme! ISAIAH, Chap. V. I Now will I sing to him I love A song shall my Beloved move, His vineyard be my theme; My well-belov'd a vineyard owns, The choicest vine of Israel's sons; And honour'd with his name. II This on a fruitful hill he plac'd, A sacred fence the borders grac'd The stones from thence remov'd: In this he set the fairest vine, A stately tow'r he set within, Secur'd the plants he lov'd. III A wine-press in the midst he brought, Expecting now with greatful thought, The fruit of all his toil; When lo! (a prodigy to tell!) The vineyard that he lov'd so well, Had brought forth none but wild. IV Agast at this the owner stood, A moment paus'd in silent mood, The end of all his pain; When turning to the ungreatful band, With weeping eyes, and lifted hand, Behold him thus complain. V Hear now, I pray you, ye who dwell In Salem's mount, or Judahs' vale, And fairly judge between Me and my vineyard I have sown, And tell me what I could have done, That is not done therein. VI What the sad reason, when I thought My vine would goodly grapes have brought, It brought forth none but wild; What the dire cause why all my hope, With all my joy is swallow'd up, And all my pains beguil'd, VII Come then, go to and trembling hear, The judgment that I now declare My vineyard shall befall; The fence thereof I will remove, Devouring beasts within shall rove, And leviel'd lie her wall. VIII Her plants despoil'd by enviou's feet, No pruning hand her tendrills greet, Her glebe no furrows turn; Waste will I lay her borders wide, Her fairest borders, hence the pride Of briars and of thorn. IX The clouds supprest at my command, Shall now with-hold their watry hand, And disappoint their toil; No grateful show'rs of rain or dew, The wither'd surface shall renew Or bless the barren soil. X The vineyard of the Lord of hosts, The house of Israel fondly boasts, And Judah joins her name; His pleasant plant, themselves they call, Whilst each before their idols fall, And glory in their shame. XI He look'd for judgment, but behold Oppression, with her frontlet bold, Uprear'd her neck on high! For righteousness, but hark the moan, Of injur'd souls, whose spirits groan The loud unheeded cry! XII Wo unto them, whose greedy hand, Jonis house to house, and land to land, The world, as gods, assume! Eager to grasp earth's widest bound, They madly sweep her ample round From nations yet to come. XIII This have I heard, saith Israel's God, And this I publish all abroad, (Cease then thy fruitless vaunt) Thy structures shall the ruin share E'en many houses, great and fair Without inhabitant. XIV Pale famine too, with stern dismay, The harvest of thy wings shall slay, And scarce beneath the one; Thine Omer but an Ephah yeld, (Such the hard product of thy field) A tenth thy hand had sown! XV Wo unto them that early rise, Await the dawn of midnight skies, The men of ease, reclin'd; Strong to digest the mingl'd flame, Till ev'ning quaff th'envenom'd stream, In liquid chains consin'd. XVI The harp, the viol, and the lute, Soft melting notes of am'rous flute, Their wild debauch attend; Their wine its sparkling lustre rears, While none Jehovah's thunder hears, Or dread his threat'ning hand. XVII Therefore because they have not lov'd My knowledge, Israel is remov'd, And into exile gone; By famine are her nobles slain, And all her multitudes complain, By parching thirst undone. XVIII For this hath hell her mouth enlarg'd, Devils from Erebus emerg'd, Their trembling prey demand; Their glory, pomp, and multitude, With all who dance the joyous road Together shall descend. XIX The mean man shall be broken down, With him, the man of high renown, The lofty eye shall fall; The Lord of host in judgment shine, And God in righteousness divine, Exalted be by all. XX Then shall the lambs, with sportive ease, As once of old, in happier days From harm secure lie down; Their fatten'd lords to strangers yield, Who take possession of their field, And call the lands their own. XXI Wo to the men of minds deprav'd, Whose hearts to wickedness enslav'd, With cords their conscience draw; By judgment doom'd to love their sin, They drag th'infatuating chain, And serve her deadly law. XXII Whose mouths with blasphemies Defile The name of Israel's God revile, And scorn his out-stretch'd hand; “Make haste (say they) thy work bring near, “The councils of thine heart declare, “That we may understand.” XXIII Wo unto them who in their heart The cause and end of things pervert; Evil and good confound: To darkness give the name of light, To day the darkness of the night, The bitter-sweet compound. XXIV Wo to the fools, reputed wise, The prudent, who with scornful eyes On all beside look down; My calls and menaces contemn, The methods of my wisdom blame, Conceited of their own. XXV Wo to the drunkards of renown, Who strong th'empoison'd draught drink down, Its mingled force defy, Who clear the wicked for reward, The just, tho' injur'd, disregard, Their suit, tho' just, deny. XXVI Therefore as chaff the flames consume, And stubble (by the repers doom To ruin is consign'd; So shall their blasted root decay, To dust their blossom fade away, Th'sport of ev'ry wind. XXVII And wherefore have I all this done, And why rejected thus mine own? The sad occasion hear! Because they have transgrest my word! Despis'd the council of the Lord, My yoke refus'd to bear. XXVIII Therefore the anger of the Lord, High-blazing as a meteor'd sword, Hath swift descended down, The fury of his outstretch'd hand, Hath smote the people of his land, And all their pride o'erthrown. XXIX The mountains from their basis rose, While torn by hands of merc'less foes, Their corps unpitied lay; And yet his anger still doth frown, His vengeful arm in fury shewn, Is still unturn'd away. XXX He shall on high his standard rear, {Bl}iss for the nations from on far, To earth's remotest bound; With speed their eager steps shall bend Swift on the polar winds attend The all-alarming sound. XXXI None shall of weariness complain, Or stumbling fall to rise in vain, But firm maintain their ground; No slumber unforseen surprize, Or steal unwilling on their eyes By sleep's soft fetters bound. XXXII Their strengthen'd loins with ease march on; The latchet of their shoes well drawn, Shall firm their footsteps bind; Their arrows sharp, their bows all bent, Their horses hoofs as solid flint, Their wheels as rapid wind. XXXIII Like lions, from their thickets rous'd, Or lions whelps, from dens unhous'd, Their angry voice shall roar; Roaring, shall seize the trembling prey, Shall seize, and carry it away Beyond redemption's pow'r. XXXIV And in that day their voice shall roar, As surges on the sounding shore, Their voice be heard on high; The trembling land with blackness crown'd; While baleful sorrows howl around, And darkness rules the sky. ISAIAH, Chap. XII. I In that glad day, the day of grace, Thy lips shall say, “Thee will I praise, Whose love hath made me whole; Tho' once thy wrath against me burn'd, Thou hast away thine anger turn'd, And comforted my soul. II Behold the Lord is my defence! His arm shall bear my spirit hence; My rock, Jehovah, God! My strength, my saviour, and my song, That leads my raptur'd soul along Salvation's shining road.” III Therefore with joy thy panting soul Shall stop the torrents as they roll, And drink by faith below; Thy hand shall reach the water'd skies, Where wells of bright salvation rise, And living fountains flow. IV And in that day be this thy theme; Praise ye the Lord, invoke his name, And make his wonders known; With grateful joy his mercies sing, Make mention that the Lord is King Of all the earth alone! V Sing to the Lord for he hath done Great things; to all his grace be known, Be known his grace to all! Cry out, and shout, fair Zion's land, For great is he whose footsteps stand Within thy sacred wall! ISAIAH, Chap. XXVI. I In that day shall this sacred song By Judah's ransom'd sons be sung, Strong is thy saints abode; Salvation hath thy temples crown'd, For walls and bulwarks plac'd around The city of our God! II Open the doors of faith and love, That they who keep my law may prove The liberty divine; Who keep the truth in humble fear, The honours of their Lord may share, And ever walk therein. III Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, Whose mind is staid upon thy grace, Because he trusts in thee; Trust ye forever in the Lord, Fo lo! the great Jehovah's word Thy strength shall ever be. IV He brings them down that dwell on high; The city that assays the sky Lo levels to the ground; The poor and needy on them tread, As ashes on the surface spread, By tempests blown around. V The way of the just is upright, His ways are equal in thy sight, Drawn by the living line; Thou most upright his paths doth weigh, His actions in the ballance lay Of equity divine. VI And in thy judgments way, O Lord, Have we with trembling search'd thy word, Athirst thy love to know; Our souls desire is to thy name, Thy kind memorial be our theme, Throughout this vale of woe. VII Beneath affliction's darken'd shade, My soul her fervent suit has made, And nightly sought thy face; Nor less when all my griefs are o'er, My spirit shall thy hand adore, And magnify thy grace. VIII For when thy judgments are abroad, Earth's haughtiest sons shall hear thy rod, And learn thy righteous law; The harden'd sinner shall repent, The adamantine heart relent, O'erwhelm'd with contrite awe. IX And yet tho' favour should be shown, Thy hand the wicked will not own, Or reverence thy word; Nor, tho' among thy saints, eschew Their sin, or with thy people view The glory of the Lord. X Lord, when thy hand is lifted up, They will not see, nor contrite stoop Beneath thy threat'ning power; Thy threat'ning power will they deny, Or else thine outstretch'd arm defy, And dare th'impending shower. XI But still with all their vain decree, They shall with shame their envy see, At those thy love hath blest; Th'invidious fire within shall burn, The pointed flames inverted turn, And scorch the envier's breast. XII Thou, Lord wilt peace for us ordain, Our desperate cause thy love maintain, And all our works fulfil; Without thy life, what have we here! Darkness our light, our hope despair, And all our comforts fail. XIII O Lord, our God, with grief we own, Our Souls have other idols known, And bow'd before their shame; But lo! with broken hearts we vow, That by thee only, will we now Make mention of thy name. XIV They all are dead, they shall not live, They are deceas'd, nor shall revive, Forever slain they lie; In fury hast thou them destroy'd, Their vile memorial made void, And all their glories die. XV Thou hast increas'd the nation, Lord, And magnify'd the gospel-word, Thro' all the world abroad; The world thy witnesses have been, And earth's remotest ends have seen The glory of our God. XVI Lord, in their trouble have they cry'd, To thee their humble pray'r apply'd, Beneath thy chast'ning rod; Their souls opprest by satan's bands, In darkness stretch their guilty hands, And sought the distant God. XVII Like unto her, that drawing near Her time of travel, pierc'd with fear, (Keen as th'avenger's sword;) Groans in her pangs the bitter groan; So have we made our plaintive moan, Within thy sight, O Lord! XVIII We too have been with child, and we Have groan'd our fruitless agony, A vain, abortive hope! No liberty have we regain'd, The foe hath still his right maintain'd, Nor gives the conquest up. XIX Yet saith the Lord, thy dead shall live, Sown in corruption shall revive In incorruption's pow'r; With my dead body shall they rise, And raptur'd view with sparkling eyes The long retarded hour! XX Awake then from the dust and sing, Behold I will deliverance bring, From death's devouring hand! As herbs refresh'd by dews revive, Thy moulder'd dust again shall live, At my supreme command. XXI Come then, my chosen people, come, Sav'd from the universal doom; Beneath my shade secure: In trembling hope thy soul possess, Till all the indignation cease, And all the storm be o'er. XXII For lo! the Lord his place forsakes, His vengeance on the world he takes, (His vengeance for their sin!) Earth shall disclose her slaughter'd sons, Whose blood from righteous Abel runs, And no more hide her slain. ISAIAH, Chap. XXXV. I For these the desert shall rejoice, The wilderness lift up her voice, Her hidden sweets disclose; The solitary place shall sing, Cloth'd with the verdure of the spring, And blossom as the rose. II Her blossom shall abundaut spread, As Lebanon exalt her head, And shout deliverance nigh; Carmel, and Sharon's flowing field, Shall each their verdant glories yield, And lift her horn on high. III Then with extatic joy her ear, Thrice animated sounds shall hear, While with unclouded face They view the glory of the Lord, The excellency of our God! The riches of his grace. IV Thus saith your God, th'eternal Lord, Proclaim, ye heralds of my word, The message of my peace, Hasten and bear my kind commands, In faith confirm the drooping hands, In hope the feeble knees. V Say to tste faithful heart, “be strong, Fear not, for e'er thy hope be long, Thy God will surely come; With vengeance will he plead thy cause, And ransom'd, save thee from the jaws Of hell's eternal doom.” VI Then shall the blind their sight receive, And seeing the report, believe The promise of the Lord; The deafen'd ears unstop'd shall hear The voice that bids, dismiss thy fear, And listen to my word. VII The lame shall then his staff forego, And leap exulting as the roe; The tongue obmute shall sing; The wilderness with streams abound, The desert's rude, unfertile ground With living fountains spring. VIII The parched land becomes a pool, The thirsty ground shall drink her full, By living springs o'erflow'd; Where the fell dragon rul'd the strand, The sprightly reed shall kiss thy hand, The bullrush lowly nod. IX An high-way shall be there, a way Of knowledge, and unclouded day, Of holiness divine; No feet impure, its paths shall tread, Tho' sucklings, by my wisdom led, Shall walk secure therein. X No lion rousing from his lair, Or tyger, with his fiery glare, Shall stalk their midnight road; There the redeem'd alone are found, Their feet impress the hallow'd ground, The courts of mine abode. XI There shall the ransom'd of the Lord, In everlasting peace restor'd, With shouts of joy return; To Zion's mount their footsteps bend, Her heights of holiness ascend, On eagle's wings upborn. XII With gladness crown'd, o'erwhelm'd with joy, Bright songs of love their lips employ Thro' one eternal day; No more shall grief their souls oppress, The sighing tear of deep distress, Forever wip'd away. ISAIAH, Chap. LIV. I Sing, O thou barren of the Lord, Thy Saviour's all-creating word, In shouts his love proclaim; Whose pow'r informs thy fertile womb With hosts of nations yet to come, Beyond thy rival's fame. II Enlarge the place of thine abode, Extend around thy lineal rod, Thy curtains wide display; Spare not, but lengthen out thy line, And look to see the hand divine Prepare thy childrens way. III Thy seed extended o'er the plain, Each way pours out their num'rous train, Thou shalt their fulness see; Their tribes possess the Gentile land; Thy feet within their gates shall stand, Inhabited by thee. IV Fear not, for I from off thy face Will ever wipe the foul disgrace, Thine injur'd fame restore; Thou shalt forget thy virgin shame, The scandal of thy widow'd-name Shall not be mention'd more. V For thy Creator is thy Lord, Thine husband, the incarnate word, The Lord of hosts his name! Thy Saviour, Israel's Holy One, The God of all the earth alone, Unchangeably the same. VI Lo! as a wife of youth, bereav'd, A mourner, and in spirit griev'd, I call'd thee, saith thy God; When man refus'd thy plaint to hear, My heart did all thy sorrows bear, And eas'd the pond'rous load. VII For a small moment have I left Thy soul of ev'ry joy bereft, Affliction's easy prey; But in the multitude of love, My mercy shall thy fears remove, And bring the bridal day. VIII A while displeas'd, I hid my face, But now with everlasting grace Thy peace shall be restor'd; My mercy to thine off-spring known, In everlasting kindness shown, Saith thy redeeming Lord. IX For as the waters of the flood, Before me from of old, have stood, Each in their bed confin'd; So hath my faithfulness once sworn, Mine anger shall no more return, Or vex thy healed mind. X The mountains shall far off be drove, The everlasting hills remove, Their place no more be found; But firm my love's foundation stands, The contract of my peace remains Thro' one eternal round. XI O thou distrest, with tempest tost! Of comfort spoil'd! I sing thy boast! Thy blissful change attend! Thy stones with pencil'd art shall shine, High sapphir'd-walls of skill divine, Thy cities shall defend. XI, XIII Thy windows, agate shall compose, Thy gates, carbuncle, as the rose, Bright pearls thy borders grace; Thy children shall be taught of God, Their knowledge wide diffus'd abroad; And great shall be their peace. XIV Thy soul in righteousness confirm'd, Thy heart with grateful ardour warm'd, Their threat'nings shall defy; Oppression drops her trembling hands; Pale terror at a distance stands, Nor dares the foe draw nigh. XV Behold! the nations shall combine, Kings, with their arms united join, But not at my command; Therefore their strongest force shall fail, Their mightiest men shall not prevail, But fall beneath thy hand. XVI Behold! the Cyclops are my care, Whose arms new mould the massy bar, By sevenfold fires refin'd; Nor less have I the waster made, Whose schemes of force or guile succeed, But to perform my mind. XVII No weapon form'd against thy peace. Shall ever find the vain success; Each tongue suborn'd shall fail: This is the portion of my saints, My mercy shall supply their wants, And all their hopes fulfill. MALACHI. Chap. IV. I Behold the day of vengeance near, Whose light as burning shall appear, When all the proud shall fail; The wicked shall as stubble burn, Their branch cut off, their root uptorn, As fuel fit for hell. II But upon you who seek my face, Shall rise the Sun of righteousness, With healing in his wings; As victim'd heifers shall ye shine, Compleat in righteousness divine, My chosen priests and kings. III Then shall ye on the wicked tread, As dust beneath your footsteps spread, Who long have trodden you: Ye all shall more than conqu'rors rise, And view, enraptur'd with surprize, The wonders I shall shew. IV But e'er my glory be reveal'd, My purposes of love fulfil'd, Hear what I now command; Keep ye my law, my words regard, By Moses once in Horeb heard, Mine ordinance divine. V Behold! before the day draws nigh, When judgment shall be heard on high, And earth her doom receive; Elijah's warning voice I send, (The prophet's warning voice attend) Repent ye, and believe. VI The parent to his child shall turn, The child with filial duty burn, In bands alternate led: Lest in my wrath's avenging doom, My judgments as a whirlwind come, And curse the world I made. The MAGNIFICAT. Luke I. Ver. 47, &amp;c. I My soul doth magnify the Lord, My spirit joys in God the word, My Saviour, and my hope, Who hath on me his favour plac'd, And from the dust of earth hath rais'd His lowly handmaid up. II Therefore, behold! from this glad day, The nations that in embryo lay, Shall bless my rising fame; For he whose might doth all controul, In love hath magnify'd my soul, And holy is his name. III Nor less his sov'reign grace extends To the wide world's remotest ends, Where e'er his name's ador'd; Strength with his arm the Lord hath shewn, The proud in just revenge o'erthrown, And all their hope abhorr'd. IV The mighty from their seat he cast, The meek and humble poor at last Rejoice to see his day; The hungry are with good replete, While princes, prostrate at his feet, Are empty sent away. V Thus in memorial of his grace, The Stock of Israel's chosen race, Are holpen by his pow'r; According to his promise made, To Abraham, and his faithful seed, Henceforth forever more. DOXOLOGY. All glory, praise, and high renown, To him, that from his lofty throne, Regards the lowly mind; Whose eyes far off the proud behold, While yet his arms of love enfold The basest of mankind. Song of ZECHARIAS. Luke I. Ver. 58, &amp;c. I All hail! Jeshurun's mighty God! Who from his dread supreme abode, Hath graciously look'd down; His people with his favour bless'd, An horn of great salvation rais'd On David's sacred throne. II According to his faithful word, By prophets known, of high record, E'er since the world began; Deliv'rance from our foes we claim, Their rage defy in Jesu's name, Th'eternal son of man. III That thus he might his mercy shew, The patriarch's antient joy below, By future hope upborne;) Faithful to ev'ry word he spake, Remembring for his promise sake, The oath to Abraham sworn. IV That we who here his truth receive, Sav'd from the fowler's snare might live. And serve him without fear, In holiness and perfect peace, Throughout the remnant of our days, Till all his grace appear. V And thou, my child, thine office know, Thy Saviour's harbinger below, Sent to prepare his way; Thy feet shall go before his face, To tell the tidings of his grace, In this his gospel-day. VI A day of grace, and gracious things, A day that full deliverance brings, The end of all our pain; A day of peace, and joy, and pow'r, Which God's eternal mercies shower On all the sons of men. VII Thro' whom the day-spring from on high, On balmy wings hath left the sky, With light our paths to greet; To lighten those who fit beneath The sable gloom of horrid death, And bless our wand'ring feet. VIII Come, Lord, thy sacred light impart, And with thy brightness chear my heart, My lukewarm soul inflame; My mind with cords of love allure, Till of thy glory made secure. I shout thy wond'rous name. NATIVITY. Luke II. 8. I Assert in Salem's peaceful land, Some shepherds watch'd (a rural band) Their slumb'ring flocks by night; The angel of the Lord came down, Bright beams of daz'ling glory shone, And shock'd their ravish'd sight. II When thus, the heav'nly messenger, With accent mild, “Dismiss your fear, “For lo! to you I bring, “Glad tidings of prophetic joy, “Which soon shall every heart employ, “And ev'ry tongue shall sing. III “For unto you, in David's town, “(A place henceforth of high renown) “Is born of David's line, “A Saviour, who is Christ the Lord, “(The Father's co-eternal word) “And this shall be your Sign; IV “Th'incarnate God, you there shall find, “In mant'ling garb of meanest kind, “And in a manger laid;” (Condemn'd to scorn, and grief, and pains, No crown of glory now remains, On his devoted head.) V At once a bright, angelic throng, With golden harps forever strung, Their grand applaud began: “Glory to God that reigns on high, “Eternal peace beneath the sky, “And great good-will to man!” VI Soon as the fair, seraphic host, Swift-wing'd for heav'n's etherial coast, From human sight were flown, The shepherds each to other say, “To Beth'lem haste we now our way, “And see what God has done!” VII Their steps they bend with willing speed, And wond'ring saw the mighty deed, In every part fulfill'd; Which done, they publish all abroad, The things that from the mouth of God Were told them of the child. VIII While wonder seiz'd on all who heard, Or seeing, struck with awe, rever'd, (Yet seen how small a part!) In silent joy the virgin stood, Her mind prophetic-mov'd to God, Revolv'd them in her heart. IX Mean time, behold! the exulting swains, Their tender care on Jordan's plains, With thankful minds resume; Their souls elate with heav'nly hope, With full assurance now look up For brighter joys to come. X So may my humble soul in faith, Attend thy providental path, Where'er thy love shall call: Thy voice obey with willing ear, Resign my joys, or leave my care For thee, my God, my all. LUKE, Chap. II. 25. I Where Israel's sons the world divide, And Judah boasts superior pride, There dwelt of fam'd record, Simeon, (by name,) the just, the good, A lover of the saints abode, The temple of his Lord. II Ancient in years, but young with hope, His strong unweary'd eyes lift up, Expect the Saviour nigh; On him the dove-like spirit came, And pregnant with prophetic flame, Enrapt the saint on high. III To him (by faith) to glory seal'd The sacred oracle reveal'd, His sun should not decline, Till him his longing eyes had seen, Who from eternity had been The hope of human kind. IV Warn'd from above, behold him come With joy ascend the pompous dome, Imprest with sacred awe; When, lo! the Infant-God devote, Was by his parents lowly brought According to the law. V Him in his arms he now receiv'd Whom tho' unseen, but yet believ'd, The saint his hope had made; With grateful lips his joy exprest, And ready for the promis'd rest, He worship'd God, and said. VI “Now lettest thou, thy servant, Lord, “Depart according to thy word, “In sure abiding peace; “Mine eyes have thy salvation seen, “My heart, by faith, a witness been “Of Jesu's righteousness.” VII “Which thou in mercy dost prepare “Before the face of all who share “Thine ancient Israel's hope; “The bright resplendent morning-star, “That lights the Gentiles from on far “To Zion's sacred top!” VIII Amaz'd the raptur'd parents stood, When impuls'd by the hand of God, The seer pronounc'd them blest, And turning to the virgin mild, With eye prophetic on the child, Her wond'ring soul addrest— IX “Know then, thou mother of my Lord, “This child (tho' seraphs have ador'd) “Shall yet be light esteem'd; “The stone of Israel's rise and fall, “A stumbling-block expos'd to all, “A sign by men blasphem'd. X “Nor shall the sword thy bowels spare, “Thou shalt thine off-spring's anguish share, “And feel his mortal groan; “That heav'n's high council may be seal'd, “The thoughts of every heart reveal'd, To God and man made known. DOXOLOGY. All Honour, Praise and love be paid To him, who bow'd his sacred head Beneath th'avenging sword; Of equal essence with his sire, The spirit, one co-equal fire, Be equal all ador'd! A HYMN. I Blessings eternal, great and high, To God, Immanuel, born to die, Thro' earth's remotest isle, Your shouts, ye saints, as thunders roar, Loud eccho's shake the immortal shore, And make Jehovah smile! II Nor thou, my heart, his praise with-hold, Whose tender mercies from of old, Have mark'd thee for his own; His loving-kindness made thee great, And rais'd above thy low estate, Hath seated on his throne. III A throne of grace and glory too, Which angels with amazement view, And silently admire; What depth of unexampled love Hath thus exalted worms above The first seraphic fire! IV There fix'd forever on their seat, With glory crown'd, their bliss compleat, The Saviour's blood their theme; They never from their thrones arise, But in full concert with the skies, To fall before his name. V A name replete with grace and love, That fills and fires the hosts above With pure extatic flame; A name to which archangels bow, Whom seraphs as Jehovah know, But sinners, as the Lamb. VI The Lamb be therefore all my boast, His birth and life, his death and cross, Thro' all my footsteps shine; My sole delight his will to prove, The vast circumference of that love Which circumscribes him mine. VII Mine from eternity, and mine, Throughout eternity's long line, His love resolv'd to be; What then shall break the sacred tye, Let down so low, and fix'd so high, That joins my Lord and me! Me, who had long deserted him, Made other idol-lords my theme, And gloried in my shame: But now redeem'd by Jesu's blood, I live to breathe the life of God, And glory in the lamb. DOXOLOGY. Hail then, thou sov'reign Prince of peace, Fountain of life, and joy, and bliss, Friend of the world undone! Come in thy Spirits ample pow'r, A gracious rain of virtue show'r, And consecraet thine own. FINIS.</field>
