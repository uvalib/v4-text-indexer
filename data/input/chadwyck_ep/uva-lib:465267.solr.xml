      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. TO WILLIAM MITFORD, Esq. SONNET. Mitford, the candid Critic of my lays, Who oft when wild my careless Muse would sing Smooth'd the rough note, and check'd her vagrant wing, Accept the humble gift she grateful pays; Though now your thoughts to bolder heights you raise, By History's awful Goddess taught to bring Celestial flowers from Freedom's hallow'd Spring To crown the Chiefs of Grecia's happier days, Yet See Essay upon the Harmony of Language, written by Mr. Mitford, and published by Robson, in the year 1776. how to harmonize the tuneful strain Your voice has shewn Aonia's listening throng; Nor will you, though your nicer ear retain What sounds to purest Melody belong, This tribute from a ruder Bard disdain, Proud to record your friendship in his song. HENRY JAMES PYE, Faringdon-House, Dec. 18, 1786. ODE ON THE DIVINE OMNIPRESENCE. A COLLEGE EXERCISE. I. O sacred Muse! thy aid impart, To rapture wake the sounding lyre! And kindle in my panting heart A spark of more than mortal fire: With votive hands the lay consign To awful Majesty Divine, On whom all life depends, Whose glorious form we wondering trace Through all the varied paths of space, Far as our bounded sight extends.— The search our dazzled reason leaves behind, Exceeds all depth of thought, and mocks the human mind. II. Whate'er on earth, in seas, or air, Strikes with delight the roving eye, Proclaims aloud the Eternal's care, And speaks a present Deity;— Those who with active pinions cleave The yielding sky, the lucid wave In countless myriads throng, Or through the sylvan regions stray,— The insect offspring of a day, The echoing forest's vernal song, More strongly than an angel's voice declare, Where-e'er we turn our eyes, the God of Life is there. III. Now beyond earth's contracted goal On Contemplation's wings arise, And mark the unnumber'd worlds that roll Their orbs stupendous through the skies.— My eye the splendid scene explores, And now my active fancy soars; To other suns, which far away On distant systems pour the blaze of day, Beyond where Saturn wheels his tedious flight Around our chearing source of light.— Forward in vain my restless thoughts I send, They rush for ever on nor find an end, On every side still open lie The boundless fields of vast immensity.— Could then my voice celestial numbers sing, My hands strike rapture from the lyric string, Yet would my heart those numbers deem Unequal to the glorious theme; Unequal to exalt his holy name, Whose awful presence guides the amazing frame; Who, of all nature's wide extent the soul, Exists in every part, and animates the whole. ODE ON THE BIRTH OF THE PRINCE OF WALES. I. 1. The fading beam of parting day Forsakes the western sky, Now shines Diana's gentler ray With virgin majesty; Her face with milder glory bright Illumes the dusky shades of night, And brings the varied scene to view. The glassy lake, and bubbling stream, Again reflect the borrow'd beam, And take a silver hue. 2. From the deep shade of yonder trees The screaming night-birds call, While floats on Zephyr's balmy breeze The distant waterfall: Sad Philomela's warbling throat Pours to the moon her plaintive note And charms the lay-resounding grove, Where, trembling at the gentle gale, The verdant beech, and poplar pale, With rustling murmurs move. 3. What dreadful sounds arise?— These notes of rural music sink And shrill-ton'd clarions rend the skies; The air a voice of triumph chears, And lo! a form divine appears On Cherwell's sedgy brink. His azure length of robe behind Loosely wantons in the wind; Glowing like the vernal morning Beams benign his eye-balls shed; Ceres' wealth his brows adorning Shades his venerable head. Say heavenly vision what these notes portend? Sits white-wing'd Victory on Britannia's arms? Does proud Iberia to her legions bend, Or flies the Gaul at Granby's dread alarms, Or stalks on India's sun-burn'd coasts afar The force of conflict keen, and giant rage of war? II. 1. ‘Far hence,’ he cried, ‘the tumult's roar ‘To distant realms shall fly: ‘Mirth revels now on Albion's shore ‘With blythe festivity. ‘Ye Muses twine each fragant flower ‘To crown the day, to crown the hour, ‘Which gave to George a blooming heir; ‘Ye Guardians of this favor'd isle ‘On this your future monarch smile, ‘Ye Nymphs your wreaths prepare. 2. ‘Come happy child! delight the land ‘Where time shall fix thy throne: ‘O come, and take from Freedom's hand ‘A sceptre all her own: ‘And when the sacred lore of truth ‘Display'd, shall form thy ripening youth, ‘May every joyful Briton find ‘The soul of George's godlike race, ‘With lovely Charlotte's softer grace, ‘Attemper'd, in thy mind. 3. ‘For thee on Afric's sultry coast ‘The British ensign proudly waves; ‘For thee by distant tempests tost ‘Our navies awe the Gallic pride ‘On every shore, whose hostile side ‘The boundless Ocean laves.— ‘With nobler skill, and fiercer fire, ‘Strike the rapture-breathing lyre.— ‘Hark!—from Cambria's cloud-top'd mountains ‘Music winds her stream along, ‘As they flow the crystal fountains ‘Listen to the jocund song, ‘Lo radiant forms and glorious shades appear, ‘Fair as the morn in saffron mantle dight; ‘But strains divine ill suit the human ear, ‘And fleeting visions mock the mortal sight.’— He said, and rushing from my wondering eyes, On volley'd lightening borne, he sought his native skies. ODE TO LIBERTY. O liberty! celestial maid! Where has thy vagrant fancy stray'd? Dost thou from Andes' rifted brow See boundless empires spread below, See Orellana pour his stream Through forests vast, where yet the beam Of garish day could never come To penetrate the twilight gloom? Dost thou thy glowing bosom lave In shining Plata's sea-broad wave? Or dost thou listen to the roar, Where the collected waters pour Their dreadful course, and foaming sweep Down Niagara's horrid steep? And shall thy form no more be seen On Albion's hills and pastures green? Wilt thou no more Plinlimmon scale, Or sport in Cluyd's fertile dale? Wilt thou Ierne's plains forsake, And quit Kilarney's lovely lake? Shall we thy footsteps trace no more On Caledonia's mountains hoar?— Ah! nor proud Delphi's rising glade, Nor Pisa's consecrated shade, Nor Pindus' mount, nor Academe, Nor fam'd Eurotas' trophied stream, Could for an hour thy steps detain When Grecia bow'd to Vice's reign: Nor could alas! the softest gale That blows o'er rich Campania's vale, Tempt thee to breathe the Latian air When Luxury exulted there. Far from bright Phœbus' genial light Thy wings indignant shaped their flight To Scandanavia's frozen plain, Eternal Winter's drear domain; Where strong with toil each stubborn hord Joyful thy holy form ador'd: Though, where their tribes the earth o'er-ran, Fell desolation led the van, Though Horror midst their armies stood, And drench'd their fatal paths with blood; Yet theirs the unextinguish'd flame That glows at Freedom's sacred name, Theirs the firm breast that joys to bleed For Independence' godlike meed. But say, does Albion hapless groan Beneath a Tyrant's bloody throne? Say, do her dauntless Patriots feel The fatal ax, and torturing wheel?— O'er her no cruel Tyrant reigns, No patriot blood her scaffold stains. 'Tis Luxury's insidious hand Spreading Corruption through the land; 'Tis Indolence whose powers controul Each nobler purpose of the soul; 'Tis noisy Faction's selfish aim, Disguis'd beneath thy specious name. These are the fiends whose fatal rage In every clime, and every age, Have overturn'd each noble pile Rear'd by thy hands with useless toil: But where in hardship's rugged school Mankind have learn'd themselves to rule, Pale Slavery there may shake in vain Her iron rod, and galling chain: No force the fearless soul can bind, Or bow the unconquerable mind. Scorn'd is the Tyrant's harsh decree When inborn Virtue bids be free. ODE TO BEAUTY. I. Enchanting power! whose influence blest O'er Nature reigns with pleasing sway, Whose mild command each gentler breast Enraptur'd glories to obey: O give my ravish'd sense to trace In every form thy polish'd grace, Whether thy footsteps deign to tread The level of the enamel'd mead, Whether thou joy'st to haunt the dale, Or drink the mountain's ambient gale, Or, with a more ambitious aim, To animate the human frame, Bid the bright eye resistless charm, The snowy bosom swell, or shape the ivory arm. II. When at the Eternal's dread command From Chaos rose this fabric fair, He bade thy ornamenting hand O'er all creation spread it's care. By thee was Earth's maternal breast Involv'd in verdure's radiant vest, Heaven's spacious arch thy tints embue With the deep azure's dazzling hue, O'er the bleak hill thy order bade The forest spread luxuriant shade, Thy fingers through the irriguous mead The river's shining current lead Till it's increasing waters gain The unconfin'd expanse of Ocean's vast domain. III. Glows not a shrub with vivid bloom Mid the recesses of the vale; Sheds not a flower it's rich perfume To scent the pinions of the gale; Waves not a beech it's leafy bough To shade the mountain's hoary brow; Bends not an osier dank to lave It's branches in the passing wave. Down the rude cliff's tremendous side Pours not a stream it's whitening tide, Nor arch'd by silver poplars, cool Spreads it's smooth breast the lucid pool, But every Muse shall read thy care, Shall trace thy vagrant step, and mark thy pencil there. IV. But in the lovely Virgin's eye And polish'd form, and blooming face, Thy fairest lustre we descry, And gaze upon thy purest grace. Ah say! can all the mingled flowers Whose roseate leaves, the circling hours On earth's green bosom lavish fling, When genial Zephyr breathes the spring, Please like the maid whose charms inspire The glowing wish of young desire? Though blush with varied dyes the trees, Though sweets ambrosial load the breeze, Flies every bloom, fades every green, Till female Beauty deign to crown the enchanting scene. V. Beneath the spicy forest's shade The Indian breathes his amorous vow, Where ice eternal binds the glade Thy power the frozen Zemblians know; For there thy beam with heavenly light Has chear'd the gloom of polar night. Where to the Eunuch's servile care Luxury commits the imprison'd fair, There o'er the desolated plains Stern Slavery unresisted reigns, But where Love's gentle rights are known Which mutual freedom gives alone, There Courage dwells, ingenuous Shame, And Virtue's holy meed, and Glory's ardent flame. VI. But though the smiling Landscape spread It's richest views on every side, Though waves each oak it's solemn head In all the pomp of leafy pride: What pleasure shall these scenes impart, How soothe to rest the laboring heart, If malice fell, or black despair, Or keen remorse inhabit there? And say can all the charms that lie In Hebe's cheek, or Helen's eye, Delight, if scorn, or cold disdain, Or changes desultory reign, Or Jealousy's tormenting sway, Usurp the power of Love, or cloud his golden ray. VII. 'Tis in the conscious mind alone That Beauty shews her purest beam, There stands secure her lasting throne Not idly borne on Fancy's stream: Though the rude blast, and wintry storm, The blooming Landscape's charms deform, Though withering time, or pale disease, Bid the wan cheek no longer please, Yet if within the feeling breast Soft pity dwell a welcome guest, If smiling Peace, and Meekness sweet, And Constancy there fix their seat; Then shall thy charms despise the rage Of winter's dreary frown, and mock the force of age. ODE TO HARMONY. SET TO MUSIC BY DR. PHILIP HAYES, AND PERFORMED IN THE MUSIC-SCHOOL AT OXFORD. I. Immortal Harmony! thy heavenly strain Coeval grew with sea, and earth, and skies.— What time from chaos' rude primeval reign The Almighty Fiat bade creation rise, The angelic host around applauding stood, And loud their golden lyres proclaim'd that all was good.— Those sacred lays whose voice sublime High heaven's eternal mansions hear, Amid the transient lapse of time Shall never meet the human ear, Till, torn the veil of flesh away, Stand to the soul confess'd the realms of endless day. II. Yet streams from that immortal source, Were not to mortal sense denied, On Israel's race with swelling force Unbounded rush'd the sacred tide: Judea's palmy groves around Re-echo to the hallow'd sound.— Now to the harp's responsive strings His plaintive hymn Jessides sings, Now with exulting rapture glows O'er dread Jehovah's prostrate foes, Isaiah now with fiercer fire Strikes loud the bold prophetic wire, And treads, or seems in act to tread, O'er proud Assyria's vanquish'd head. While now the lay pathetic thrills By Babel's willow-border'd rills, As from Judea's captive train The victor's taunting voice demands the choral strain. III. But hark!—what lays enchanting sound Unroots the forest from the ground? By the persuasive powers subdu'd Charm'd from the prey the savage brood Attentive listen round.— 'Tis he, the first of Grecia's choir, 'Tis Orpheus strikes the living lyre! And see Alcæus' sterner hand Appals pale slavery's trembling band, See rapid Pindar loosely flings His fingers o'er the warbling strings, While, as the drama's potent art Or melts or terrifies the heart, More sighs arise, more sorrows flow, As Music's aiding hand strikes deep the shafts of woe. IV. Nor yet amid the wreck of time The rapturous powers are lost: Soft breathe her airs on every clime, And visit every coast.— What though Hesperia's sunnier day Now boast to wake the sweetest lay; Yet sure, if ere the throbbing breast Sweet Music's native voice confess'd, To the soft measures that proceed From Caledonia's northern reed, No feeling bosom shall deny The genuine claim of Melody. V. Though wild caprice with frantic hand Awhile may seize the sacred lyre, While folly's sons applauding stand To hear her strike the wire: O Albion! as thy polish'd ear Will none but classic numbers hear, So let thy voice propitious own Those thrilling notes that strike the heart alone. Whether the soft melodious lay In simple measures flow, Now warbling elegantly gay, Now tuned to placid woe. Or Harmony with choral song Pour her impetuous stream along, While loud the swelling strains of rapture roll, O'ercome the captive sense, and shake the astonish'd soul. Sent to Dr. HAYES, with the ODE to HARMONY. As Man's dull form inert and silent lay, A senseless heap of unenliven'd clay, Till bold Prometheus with ethereal flame Rous'd into life the animated frame, So shall my torpid verse a charm acquire From the bright touch of thy harmonious fire; To these mute lays the voice of Music give, And by thy Genius bid my numbers live, Amid thy verdant bays this flow'ret twine, ‘And make immortal, verse as mean as mine.’ VERSES addressed to a LADY. Of toil you say a moderate share In each pursuit should rise, Too much may make our hearts despair, Too little we despise: In every common case I own The justness of the thought, A fly may be too quickly won, The world too dearly bought. Not so in Love; his charms depend Upon himself alone, No foreign circumstance can lend A lustre to his throne: Though gain'd without one care, his joys High-valued must remain, Are cheaply purchas'd when the prize Of Industry and care. EPIGRAM. OMNIA VINCIT AMOR. O Love, though Virgil's lays ascribe Resistless power to thee, Yet still I thought the happy tribe Of Dulness, ever free; Potent I deem'd her ample shield Her favorite sons to save, Though to thy soft dominion yield The virtuous, wise, and brave: But since I see, thy votary grown, Even Paridel obey, I find myself compell'd to own Thy universal sway. Written on a LADY's FAN. In ancient times when like La Mancha's Knight The adventurous Hero sallied forth to fight, Some sage Magician famous in Romance Supplied the Warrior with a wonderous lance, With which through adverse troops he forced his way, And won from giant hosts the doubtful day. But I more fatal arms to you impart, By Venus forged to wound the human heart: This Weapon placed in your victorious hand No cunning shall elude, no force withstand, Nor shall the brave resist, or coward fly, But all Mankind submit, adore, or die. SONG. [Fair Delia while each sighing swain] Fair Delia while each sighing swain Whose heart your charms adores, Fills with his tender vows the plain, And favoring smiles implores: My Wishes varying from the rest Demand a different boon, And only ask this one request, The mercy of a frown. Ah! far from me those witching smiles Those languid eyes remove, Whose charms my senses might surprise, And tempt my heart to Love; The chilling frowns of cold disdain I'll patiently endure, Content to bear a transient pain My freedom to secure. SONG. [The flowers of the Spring that enamel the vale] The flowers of the Spring that enamel the vale, Give their dyes to the meadows, their sweets to the gale, From the sun-beam, the shower, and the soft-falling dew Receive all their treasures of odour, and hue. When Winter extends his tyrannical reign, Fades every gay blossom that painted the plain, And all the bright offspring of sunshine and showers Shrink up at the blast of December's stern hours, Though Love's gentle power can more sweetness disclose Than the vi'let or woodbine, the jasmine or rose, Yet none of them holds so precarious perfume, A texture so tender, so fleeting a bloom. All it's sweetness it draws like the Daughters of May From Pity's soft dew, and from Kindness' mild ray, Like them it will shrink from the frost of Disdain, But never like them will it blossom again. SONG. [Let no Shepherd sing to me] Let no Shepherd sing to me The stupid praise of Constancy, Nature bids her subjects range, All creation's full of change. See the varying hours display Morning, Evening, Night, and Day, See the circling seasons bring Summer, Winter, Autumn, Spring. Shall the river's current full Idly sleep a stagnate pool, Shall the pedant's mandate bind The rapid wave, the fleeting wind. Thus I sung when Chloe's eyes Made my vanquish'd heart their prize, Where's my passion now to range, Love of Freedom, love of Change. Still my breast retains it's views, Still variety pursues, Happy in one Nymph to find Every charm of Womankind. THE SNOW-DROP. Hail earliest of the opening flowers! Fair Harbinger of vernal hours! Who dar'st unveil each silken fold Ere Sol dispels the wintry cold, And with thy silver leaves display'd Spread lustre through the dreary glade.— What though no frgarance like the rose Tincturing the Zephyr as it blows, Thy humble flowers from earth exhale To scent the pinions of the gale; What though no hues of gaudy dye Strike with their dazzling charms the eye, Nor does thy sober foliage shew Each blended tint of Iris' bow; Yet in thy meek unsullied grace Imagination's eye shall trace The glowing blossoms that appear Proudly to paint the vernal year, And smiling Maia's blushing dyes, And jocund Summer's cloudless skies, And Autumn's labors which succeed To bid the purple vintage bleed, Our hopes anticipating see Led on in radiant train by thee. Written in the Year 1779, when the Combined Fleets were off Plymouth. When the keen axe remorseless laid The woods of Edgecombe low, Lest now their leafy skreen should aid The approaches of the foe; Astonish'd from their dark retreats The frantic Dryads rove, And Echo shrieks of woe repeats Through all the wasted grove: ‘Must we,’ they cry, ‘so long who dwelt ‘On this wave-cinctur'd steep, ‘Who each rude blast unshrinking felt ‘That heaves the Atlantic deep, ‘Must we forsake these solemn shades ‘To distant regions driven, ‘Or view expos'd our forest glades ‘To every beam of heaven?— ‘But ah! what horrid scenes are these!— ‘Lo Bourbon's hostile train ‘Here spread their canvas to the breeze, ‘And darken half the main: ‘Britannia's bloody cross no more ‘Aloft triumphant flies, ‘For see by this insulted shore ‘The Gallic lilies rise! ‘Speed then, oh speed your eager toil! ‘And on this lofty steep ‘Tear every sapling from the soil ‘And launch them on the deep. ‘To you we sisters of the wood ‘At once our charge resign, ‘Ye sea-green daughters of the flood, ‘Old Ocean's Nereid line. ‘So shall they to this threaten'd place ‘A barrier firm extend, ‘And shores their shade was wont to grace, ‘Their thunder shall defend.’ EPITAPH ON CHARLES D'AUSSEY, ESQUIRE, IN HOLY-ROOD CHURCH, SOUTHAMPTON. When Pomp, when Wealth, when Greatness sink to dust, Though Vanity adorn the splendid bust, Sincerer drops of tributary woe O'er the lone urn of modest Merit flow. And tears as true as e'er embalm'd the dead Shall D'Aussey! o'er thy humble tomb be shed, For though thy frugal temper ne'er supplied The selfish calls of Luxury and Pride, Yet Pity's gentle voice thy heart pursu'd, And felt the Luxury of doing good, While Want reliev'd by silent bounties given, Wafts with her grateful prayers thy soul to heaven. Sent to Mr. HAYLEY, on reading his EPISTLES on EPIC POETRY. What blooming garlands shall the Muses twine, What verdant laurels weave, what flowers combine, To crown their favorite Son whose generous heart Has check'd the arrogance of Critic Art, And shewn that still in their exhaustless mine The purest gems of radiant Genius shine, To grace the venturous Poets who explore The unsun'd treasures of their sacred store? Nor this the Syren note of flattering praise, Or the fond tribute partial friendship pays; A voice unknown to fame, to thee unknown, But wak'd by thy superior worth alone, Attempts, perhaps with too officious zeal, Thy thoughts awhile from higher cares to steal, And in presumptuous numbers dares essay To hail the glories of thy matchless lay. O fairest hope of Britain's tuneful Choir! Why yield to other hands the Epic Wire? Say who of all her Bards like thee shall swell To strains of extasy th' Heroic shell? When the long series of connecting rhime Denies the raptur'd flight or march sublime Who shall the interval so well beguile With each rich ornament of polish'd style? Who o'er the thrilling heart such forms shall throw Of frantic horror, or pathetic woe? Or when the notes from Freedom's clarion blown Chill the pale Despot on his trembling throne, What manly son of Britain's warbling throng Shall join the Pæan with so bold a song? And if inventive Fancy love to stray 'Mid the wild tracts of Fiction's faery way, Say who shall mate those magic powers that stole The nightly vision o'er Serena's soul? Then let, illustrious Bard!—though rude her voice, A Muse of humble mien divert thy choice.— With timid hand snatch no reflected grace From the sweet Dante. Maniac of Hesperian race. Since Genius' keenest rays thy bosom fire O strike with native force the British Lyre, That, while such virtuous chiefs adorn thy strain As Greece and Rome shall emulate in vain, Albion may consecrate thy deathless name, And found her Epic pride on Hayley's fame.

Eartham, August 9, 1782. ELEGIES. ELEGY I. WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1761. O Happiness! thou wish of every mind, Whose form, more subtle than the fleeting air, Leaves all thy votaries wandering far behind, Eludes their search, and mocks their anxious care What distant region holds thy fair retreat, Where no keen look thy footsteps may surprise? In what lone desert hast thou fix'd thy seat, Far from the curious search of mortal eyes? Amid the jocund race, say, art thou found, Who pass in mirth the dreary hours of night; Or in the dance with pliant sinews bound, Till fades the taper at Aurora's light? Ah no! when Reason reassumes her sway, And the tamed blood in calmer current flows, These joys, like fairy visions, melt away, And leave the bosom press'd with serious woes. Or, dost Thou dwell with regal pomp and power, Rever'd and honor'd by the wise and great? Ten thousand cares on scepter'd splendor lower, And bend the weary monarch with their weight. Or, shall we seek Thee through the ranks of war, Where bold Ambition leads her daring train; While the shrill clarion, sounding from afar, Calls the slow warrior to the purple plain? Alas not there!—though conquest grace his sword, Though proudly wave his banners in the air, By legions guarded, the victorious Lord Shall find no arms to shield his heart from care. Dost Thou reside in the gay youth's fond breast, Who bends obedient to the power of love; Who, by the fair one he adores caress'd, May all the joys of mutual transport prove?— With passion fraught, though smiling now serene, In soft endearments flow each tender hour; Too soon, alas! must change the blissful scene, When time's cold blast shall blow on beauty's flower. And oft, amid the blooming days of youth, Inconstancy asserts her fickle reign; Or pale-ey'd Jealousy, with venom'd tooth, Cankers the golden links of Hymen's chain. All calm and safe the tide of love appears, The youthful poet's ever darling theme; The venturous pilot there no quicksands fears, But launches boldly down the flattering stream, Till on his bark the warring surges break, And every billow seems to threaten fate: The voice of Prudence then begins to speak, But ah, the voice of Prudence speaks too late! Is bliss sincere then no where to be found, The vain creation of the Enthusiast's mind? Or, if she deign to dwell on mortal ground, Where may we hope her fair abode to find? The sweets of pleasure, and the pomp of power, In Luxury's enchanting semblance dress'd, She slights with deepest scorn; nor will reside But in the precincts of the virtuous breast. The virtuous breast, in conscious honour bold, Will want and pain and death itself despise: Will from each trying woe, like heated gold, With greater splendor, greater merit rise. There she has ever fix'd her firmest throne; There scorn'd the bolts by rage and malice hurl'd; And, found by wisdom, and by worth alone, Mock'd the vain labors of a vicious world. ELEGY II. WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1762. Now the brown woods their leafy load resign And rage the tempests with resistless force? Mantled with snow the silver mountains shine, And icy fetters chain the rivulet's course. No pleasing object charms our wearied view, No waving verdure decks the dreary glade, Save that o'er yonder tomb the mournful yew Projects an awful solitary shade. Short is the Spring, and short the Summer hour, And short the time that fruitful Autumn reigns; But tedious roll the days when Winter's power Asserts it's empire o'er our wasted plains. As swiftly wears our Spring of life away, As swiftly will our jolly Summer go; But, ah! when Winter clouds our chearless day, Again the vernal breezes never blow! Mark this, and boast your fancied worth no more, Ye great, ye proud, ye learned, and ye brave! With hasty lapse some circling years are o'er, And lo, ye slumber in the silent grave! Why views the sage fair Pleasure's transient charm, And all her votaries gay with scowling eye? Alike he stoops to Fate's superior arm,— Alike he suffers, and alike must die! Say, what avails it then with brow severe The silken bands of Luxury to despise; To bring by thought the day of horror near, And view the tempest ere the clouds arise? Better with laughing nymphs in revels gay To give the hours to Venus, wine, and song; And, since the rapid moments never stay, To catch some pleasures as they glide along. Deluded man! whom empty sounds beguile, What transports here await thy anxious soul? Know, love abhors the venal harlot's smile, And hell-born fury rages in the bowl. Seek Virtue to be blest; but seek her far, Far from those gloomy sons of letter'd pride, Who 'gainst the passions wage eternal war, And, foes to Nature, Nature's dictates chide. Let mirth, not madness, crown the temperate feast; Let love and beauty joys refin'd impart: Though mere sensation charm the groveling breast, 'Tis mutual passion fires the generous heart. The various blessings bounteous Heaven bestows With gratitude and charity repay, Relieve thy suffering friend, or share his woes, But from his failings turn thine eyes away. So, when the wintry storms of death are past, In brighter skies, and ether more serene, Thy wither'd boughs shall bud again, to last For ever blooming, and for ever green. ELEGY III. WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1763. The dewy morn her saffron mantle spreads High o'er the brow of yonder eastern hill; Each blooming shrub a roseate fragrance sheds, And the brisk sky-lark sings his carol shrill. Not all the sweets that scent the morning air, Not all the dyes that paint the vernal year, Can from my breast divert it's weighty care, Can from my pale cheeks charm the trickling tear. Here, where the willows to the rivulet bend, That winds it's channel thro' the enamell'd mead, I'll o'er the turf my waining form extend, And rest on sedges dank my listless head. In vain the stream o'er pebbles glide along, And murmurs sweetly-lulling as it flows; In vain the stock-dove chaunts her gurgling song, Inviting slumber soft and calm repose. How at the fragrant hour of rising morn Would eager transport throb in ev'ry vein, To hear the swelling shout and jocund horn Invite the hunter to the sportive plain! But, ah, the gay delights of youth are fled!— In sighs and tears my fading life I wear; So the pale lily hangs it's drooping head, When frosts untimely blast the opening year. Philosophy, thou guardian of the heart, O come in all thy rigid virtue dress'd! With manly precept ease my killing smart, And drive this tyrant from my wounded breast. Oft would my eyes, disdaining balmy sleep, The awful labors of thy sons explore, Fathom with restless toil each maxim deep, And hang incessant o'er the sacred lore: Alas! oppos'd to love how weak, how frail Is all the reasoning of the unfeeling sage! No forceful arm can o'er his power prevail, No lenient hand the wounds he gives assuage. Yes, tyrant, yes; thou must retain thy power, Till my torn bosom yields to stronger Death: Still must I love, even in that fatal hour, And call on Delia with my latest breath. And when all pale my lifeless limbs extend, And fate has seal'd the irrevocable doom, May then my memory find a faithful friend, To write these votive numbers on my tomb: ‘Here rests a youth, who Love and Sorrow's slave, ‘Gave up his early life to pining care, ‘Till worn with woe he sought, in this calm grave, ‘A safe retreat from comfortless Despair.’ So, when the stone lays o'er my clay-cold head, If chance fair Delia to the place draw near, With one sad sigh she may lament me dead, And bathe the senseless marble with a tear. ELEGY IV. WRITTEN SEPTEMBER 1, 1763. When the still Night withdrew her sable shroud, And left those climes with steps sedate and slow; While sad Aurora, kerchief'd in a cloud, With drizzly vapours hung the mountain's brow; The wretched bird, from hapless Perdix sprung, With trembling wings forsook the furrow'd plain, And, calling round her all her listening young, In faultering accents sung this plaintive strain: ‘Unwelcome morn! too well thy lowering mien ‘Foretels the slaughters of the approaching day; ‘The gloomy sky laments with tears the scene, ‘Where rage and terror reassume their sway. ‘Ah, luckless train! ah, fate-devoted race! ‘The dreadful tale experience tells believe; ‘Dark heavy mists obscure the morning's face, ‘But blood and death shall close the dreary eve. ‘This day fell man, whose unrelenting hate ‘No grief can soften, and no tears assuage, ‘Pours dire destruction on the feather'd state, ‘While pride and rapine urge his savage rage. ‘I, who so oft have 'scap'd the impending snare, ‘Ere night arrives, may feel the fiery wound; ‘In giddy circles quit the realms of air, ‘And stain with streaming gore the dewy ground.’ She said, when lo! the pointer winds his prey, The rustling stubble gives the fear'd alarm, The gunner views the covey sleet away, And rears the unerring tube with skilful arm. In vain the mother wings her whirring flight, The leaden deaths arrest her as she flies; Her scatter'd offspring swim before her sight, And, bath'd in blood, she flutters, pants, and dies. ELEGY V. WRITTEN JUNE, 1764. Thee, sad Melpomene, I once again Invoke, nor ask the idly plaintive verse: Quit the light reed for sorrow's sober strain, And hang thy flowerets on my Delia's herse. Oft by yon silver fountain's sedgy side, Or through the twilight shade I us'd to rove, Have sung her beauties to the listening tide, And fill'd with notes like these the echoing grove: ‘Ye fragrant roses, bow your blooming heads; ‘For can your sweetness with her breath compare? ‘Ye envious lilies, wither in your beds, ‘For is your boasted whiteness half so fair?’ Vain was the lay; for O! heart-breaking thought! Those heavenly features ne'er again must charm, That form divine, with each perfection fraught, Is struck by Fate's inexorable arm. Thus far, O Death, thy cruel reign extends! Before thy sickle falls each blushing flower; But Virtue on ethereal wings ascends, And smiles disdainful on thy boasted power. Guided by her—(for Virtue's sacred lore Was ever dear to Delia's gentle breast) She to the endless realms of peace shall soar, The sacred mansions of eternal rest. Nor these the wreaths that love and fancy twine Around the tomb, where rests some flatter'd maid; But honors, due to merit's hallow'd shrine, By faithful truth with unfeign'd sorrow paid. The smallest gleam of hope I ne'er could boast; And raptur'd love in that dire moment fled, Which shew'd my dearest wish for ever lost, Which gave my Delia to a rival's bed. Yet shall thy memory, dear departed shade, In this sad breast a place for ever find; For in thy form each beauty was display'd, ‘To charm the senses, and to fix the mind.’ O! were I skill'd the immortal note to raise, And down the stream of time to wast thy name! Then would I sing thy worth in matchless lays, Bright as thine eyes, and spotless as thy fame. But, though the Muse such arduous flights denies, Nor bids with fire divine my fancy glow, These plaintive numbers nobler truth supplies, The artless voice of unaffected woe. ELEGY VI. WRITTEN IN THE SPRING, 1766. Now has bright Sol fulfill'd his circling course, Again to Taurus roll'd his burning car, Since, cruel Prudence, thy resistless force Tore me from happiness and Cynthia far. How did I then, or pensively complain, Or in the maniac's frantic accents rave! How often vow to prove resistance vain, And, spite of prudence, live my Cynthia's slave! Her much-lov'd form did every thought employ; My daily wish she was, and nightly dream; My aking bosom hop'd no dearer joy; My raptur'd fancy own'd no nobler theme. No more I wish'd, where Isis' clear waves flow, To pluck fresh laurels from the muse's shade: I long'd to climb the Cambrian mountain's brow, Since Cambria's mountains hid my favorite maid. In vain from cruel love's tyrannic reign To friendship and to wisdom I appeal; For such my sufferings, that the amorous pain Nor wisdom could assuage, nor friendship heal. Now three revolving moons had roll'd away, Still faded sorrow bent my drooping head; In slothful rest my nobler passions lay, Each fire extinguish'd, and each virtue dead: When forced to seek a more laborious field, And mingle chearful with a social train, To toil and mirth those woes began to yield, Which thought and care had combated in vain. In other scenes I now delight could find, And, far from Cynthia, found my heart at rest; Till love at length the dubious strife declin'd, And reason fix'd her empire in my breast. Then, as by sacred truth's unflattering light, I saw the follies of my former flame, I turn'd indignant from the hateful sight, Struck with remorse, and mortified with shame. I found imagination's magic wand Had all my Cynthia's dazzling charms supplied, And love, misjudging love, with partial hand, Had given those beauties nature's touch denied. A visionary shape my Fancy drew, In the fair form each polish'd grace display'd; Then like the fabled artist amorous grew, And lov'd the image which itself had made. ELEGY VII. ADDRESSED TO A PINE-TREE. WRITTEN MAY, 1766. The ruffian North has spent his savage power, Collects his winds, and quits the mountain's side; And Auster mild, with many a genial shower, Renews the laughing meadow's grassy pride. The active swallow wings her rapid flight In sportive circies through the ether bland, And in luxuriant foliage proudly dight The verdant fathers of the forest stand. No more beneath thy hospitable shade The shepherd swains their amorous descant sing, Each wanders forth amid the blooming glade To hail the new-blown daughters of the spring. Yet, while yon elms, who now so gaily spread Their leafy honors to the vernal gale, Stood naked to the wintry winds, that shed Their scatter'd glories o'er the wasted vale; Thy limbs alone, of all the dreary wood, Could brave the snowy drift, and chilling blast; Against the mingled storm uninjur'd stood, And mock'd the howling tempest as it past. For this, while all the jocund swains around The blooming season praise with youthful glee, I'll teach the nodding coverts to resound A verse that's due to gratitude and thee. I'll rove, where opening flowers their sweets combine, Where blossoms fair their varied odours breathe; Then with assiduous hand a garland twine, And on thy branches hang the votive wreath. So, while in honor of the smiling year, Echoes each hollow dale and every grove, Thy venerable shade a lay shall hear, Sacred to friendship firm and constant love. ELEGY VIII. WRITTEN AT MINSTED IN THE NEW FOREST AUGUST 24, 1767. O rising Sun! on this auspicious day With brighter beams gild every hill and grove; Ye feather'd songsters, breathe a sweeter lay! And fill the echoing woods with joy and love. And, honor'd Minsted, in thy green retreats Let every tree a prouder foliage wear! Let every floweret scatter livelier sweets, And vernal perfumes scent the autumnal year! Now has the Sun one annual circuit past, Since in thy happy shades these longing arms Receiv'd the choicest blessings man could taste, Maria's virtues, and Maria's charms! Yet witness every lawn, and every shade! So dear a bliss my bosom could not know, When to my breast I clasp'd the yielding maid, As now her wedded fondness can bestow. Let other youths, by vice or folly mov'd, For each new object change their former flame; And blush to own they love what once they lov'd, Lest virtue should approve, and idiots blame. The scorn of fools I ever shall despise; For ever pleas'd, when by my constant side Maria's beauty meets the public eyes, At home my pleasure, and abroad my pride. Where gold, not fondness, guards the nuptial chain, Weak is the parent's will, the lawyer's art: Blaspheming priests those hearts would join in vain, Whom GOD and GOD's vicegerent, Nature, part. But, oh! may we, whose hearts affection join'd, Preserve the blessing till the close of life! She in the husband still the lover find; I still enjoy the mistress in the wife. ELEGY IX. AVON. WRITTEN DURING THE STRATFORD JUBILEE. From the clear stream that o'er her grotto flows The silver-slipper'd Avon slowly rose, And pensive on her crystal urn reclin'd, Pour'd forth in notes like these her anxious mind. ‘What frantic train is this whose noise invades ‘The accustom'd stilness of my tranquil shades, ‘Whose swelling clamors float my banks along, ‘And drown the sweetness of each rural song, ‘Fill all the woods around with festal roar, ‘And fright the peaceful halcyons from my shore?— ‘And see!—from Italy's degenerate clime ‘The mottled hero fam'd in Pantomime, ‘Leads his exulting crew with impious tread ‘To soil the dust that pillows Shakespear's head: ‘With midnight sounds they break his sacred sleep, ‘And near his tomb opprobrious vigils keep. ‘Resounding axes give the solar beam ‘To scorch the borders of my lucid stream, ‘And, while around the weeping Dryads bleed, ‘The sons of riot praise the fatal deed:— ‘Them it becomes to praise: but 'midst the throng ‘What honor'd voice is that which joins the song? ‘Canst thou whose powers could give this wondering age ‘To see the soul of Shakespear grace the stage, ‘Canst thou misjudging, praise each cruel blow ‘That lays the shade by Avon's current low, ‘Canst thou approve those trees untimely doom ‘That wave their foliage o'er thy Shakespear's tomb, ‘Or view the motley sons of Masquerade ‘Insult thy patron's venerable shade? ‘But hark! loud riot swells on every side, ‘And orgies dire pollute my virgin tide; ‘Ah! let my ear the unhallow'd revels fly, ‘Nor drink the sounds of midnight ribaldry.’ She said, and plunging in the silver wave, Sought the calm refuge of her silent cave. THE MYRTLE AND BRAMBLE. A FABLE. Luxuriant with perennial green A Myrtle young and lovely stood, Sole beauty of the wintry scene, The fairest daughter of the wood: Close by her side a Bramble grew, Like other Brambles rude with thorn, Who sicken'd at the pleasing view, Yet what she envied seem'd to scorn: Full oft to blast each hated charm She call'd the fiery bolts of Jove; But Jove was too polite to harm Aught sacred to the Queen of Love: Yet was her rage not wholly cross'd, Boreas was to her wishes kind, And from his magazines of frost He summon'd forth the keenest wind. A thousand clouds surcharg'd with rain The ruffian god around him calls; Then blows intense, and o'er the plain A fleecy deluge instant falls: No more the Myrtle bears the belle, No more her leaves luxuriant shew, The thorny Bramble looks as well, Powder'd, and perriwig'd with snow. Sure some gray antiquated maid, The very Bramble of her sex, To each invidious power has pray'd, Our eyes and senses to perplex. Fashion with more than Boreas' rage A universal snow has shed, And given the hoary tint of age To every lovely female's head. O break thy rival's hated spell, Kind Nature! that where'er we ramble, Thy work from Courtoi's we may tell, And know a Myrtle from a Bramble. MADNESS, AN EPISTLE: WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1763. DIXERIT INSANUM QUI ME, TOTIDEM AUDIET, ATQUE RESPICERE IGNOTO DISCET PENDENTIA TERGO. Hor. Yes, yes, my friend, I quit the fond pretence To cool reflection, and unbiass'd sense; Your hands have torn away the thin disguise Which hid my follies from my partial eyes. Mad since I am, why should conceited pride, Deny that weakness which it cannot hide? Why blush to own the follies of my mind, When kept in countenance by half mankind? Who from the paths of Truth and Sense will stray Where Reason lights, and Virtue guards the way, After those meteors treacherous beams to rove, Ambition, Avarice, Vanity, or Love. Nor while the soul contending passions goad E'er once regret they left the safer road, Proud of their shame, and happy in their woe, Will foil the skill of Battie and Monro. Mistaken Curio, form'd alone to please In the calm circle of domestic ease, Must quit the placid joys of private life For public honors won in public strife: No listening Senate's plausive notes attend The gay companion, and the faithful friend. He'll shew the world combin'd with Stanhope's wit The flow of Townshend, and the fire of Pitt. Now with success he gets the Election o'er And gives St. Stephen's one pert blockhead more; Pretends with schemes of Wisdom fraught to rise, Declaims on libels, pensions, and excise, And, while loud laughter bursts on every side, Pours forth his nonsense with a patriot pride, Till mark'd at length by public ridicule A brainless Coxcomb, and a babbling fool, To all mankind poor Curio stands confess'd The senate's scandal, and the nation's jest. Mark yon starv'd wretch who views with eager eye The heaps of useless gold that round him lie!— That man when Fortune less profusely gave Enjoy'd her scanty gifts, nor wish'd to save, What she bestow'd with chearful hand he spent, Nor wanted millions while he had content; His pleasures lessen as her smiles increase, Till wealth immense completely blasts his peace; Now to himself each comfort he denies That public care to poverty supplies, Lets his drear mansion totter o'er his head, And 'mid profusion dies for want of bread. Lo Sylvius! once beyond description blest, Calm were his joys, and peaceful was his breast, His youth he spent remote from Camps and Courts In rural labors, and in rural sports, High forests rose obedient to his hand, And waving plenty crown'd his fertile land, With good old Port his social vaults were stor'd, And frequent sirloins smoak'd upon his board. But ah! when fifty winters should have shed A wiser influence o'er his hoary head, What time Britannia bade her happy plains Pour forth in arm'd array their native swains, His heart began with childish zeal to doat On the bright honors of a scarlet coat; The homely garb he wore must now give place To the silk sash, and regimental lace, The queue adorns his back with pendent pride, And the broad falchion dangles by his side. When thus equip'd, a Country Squire no more, Sylvius must learn to dance, and game, and whore, In every vice, with every rake he vies, Scorn'd by the gay, and pitied by the wise, Plung'd in excess, and deaf to prudence' call, His lands are mortgag'd, and his forests fall, Till seiz'd at last by penury and shame, A jail rewards him for his martial flame. Oh Hammond! form'd by Nature to dispense The charms of courtly ease, and manly sense, Each Grace that bursts spontaneous from the mind By learning temper'd, and by taste refin'd, Though many a tedious year has roll'd away Since Death's stern mandate stopp'd thy plaintive lay, Though many a tuneful Bard to Britain dear, Has paid thy shrine the tribute of a tear, Let not thy shade this votive verse disdain Though late I sing, and humbly flows my strain. In vain for thee contending Muses wove The choicest garlands of the Aonian grove, In vain thy heart, by ancient lore inspir'd, With holy Freedom's purest flame was fir'd, On one disdainful maid for ever hung The Poet's fancy, and the Patriot's tongue, And talents form'd a troubled state to guide, Fell a sad sacrifice to female pride. Since in such garbs of horror often dress'd The Fury Passions rend the human breast, Since now by Vice, and now by Folly led, To some vain Idol still we bow the head, O blame not, if my vagrant Fancy chuse The sweet delirium of the harmless Muse. Though far below proud Glory's towering height Humbly she wing her unambitious flight, Yet oft her friendly voice with placid lay Has cheer'd the sad, and charm'd the tedious day, Driven every dark idea from my breast, And sooth'd my troubled soul to peaceful rest. Oft has she stopp'd her own discordant lyre To mark how real Genius wak'd the wire, When Greece and Rome resistless pour'd along The fervid energy of glowing song, Or Albion's Bards the genuine laurel claim, And more than emulate their masters' fame. Then as the lines in varied measures flow, I melt with sorrow, or with transport glow: Now if the lay some mournful theme rehearse, I sigh responsive to the plaintive verse, Now, wak'd to fury by the martial strain, My active Fancy views the tented plain, Hears shouting squadrons join with eager force, Arms clash with arms, and horse encounter horse, Till fir'd with ardent rage and fierce delight, She breaks from reason's rein, and joins the ideal fight. Here some grave Man whose head with prudence fraught Was ne'er disturb'd by one eccentric thought, Who without meaning rolls his leaden eyes, And being stupid, fancies he is wise, May with sagacious sneers my case deplore, And urge the use of rest, and Hellebore. When in my heart contending passions roll, When rage, or malice, swell my guilty soul, If e'er I prostitute my venal lays To pour in Folly's ears the balm of praise, If ever party zeal should warp my youth From the strict rules of Justice, and of Truth, And urge me with intemperance of rage To stain the boasted candor of my page, Here let my friend! your keenest censures fall, And strike with Reason if you strike at all; To censure's honest scourge my faults I'll trust, Nor deem you cruel, while I know you just. But if you too severely deem a crime The love of numbers, and a thirst for rhime, (Happy beyond the race of man is he Who boasts a heart from greater foibles free,) O let me still the sweet delusion prove, Still keep the Folly which so much I love, Nor ever try, with useless Wisdom, kind, To tear this favorite Error from my mind. THE TRIUMPH OF FASHION. A VISION. WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1770. In that bless'd season, when descending snows, In robes of virgin white, the fields inclose; When Beaux, and Belles, their rural seats forego, For the gay seats of Almack's and Soho: When to his consort's wish the sportsman yields, And quits, for Grosvenor-Square, the frostbound fields; What time stout Labor waking rears his head, And jaded Luxury just thinks of bed; Tir'd with the toilsome pleasures of the day, Stretch'd on my couch with weary limbs I lay: Then, as disorder'd slumbers clos'd my eyes, This strange fantastic vision seem'd to rise. Methought my footsteps trod a spacious plain, Of size, assembled nations to contain: Expos'd to sight, nor screen'd by sheltering wood, Full in the midst a spacious building stood. In various ornaments, on every part, Had Architecture lavish'd all her art; Here Grecian columns Gothic structures bear, Gay China spreads her painted arches there; The artist's skill, to charm the roving view, Had mix'd old orders, and invented new. High in the dome, on massy pillars rear'd, Rich with refulgent gems, a throne appear'd, Where, deck'd in all the pomp of regal state, 'Mid gazing crouds, a female figure sat; And, while ten thousand tongues her power proclaim, The vaulted roofs re-echo Fashion's name. Round her a train of busy nymphs are seen, Dressing with skilful hands their haughty queen: Some plait her robes, her washes some prepare, Some paint her cheeks, and some adorn her hair; Still through perpetual change their labors run, One moment alters, what the last had done. Numbers each art to gain her favor try, And watch the varying motions of her eye; At her command employ their utmost skill, And yield their minds, and bodies, to her will; Lay health, and fame, and fortune, all aside, To follow blindly where her mandates guide. Let but the worshipp'd Goddess give the word, No toil seems difficult, no scheme absurd. Pale Sickness tries each art that can avail, To make her faded features yet more pale; While rosy Health's capricious fingers spread, On her fresh blooming cheeks, a foreign red. The weakly stripling, fainting with the pace, Urges o'er hill, and dale, the breathless chace; While the stout brawny youth, in languid strains, Of tender frame, and shatter'd nerves, complains. Nobles, whose sires for freedom bravely stood, Or seal'd her sacred charter with their blood, Glory their country's honor to have sold, And prostitute their dearest rights for gold; In Britain's cause while patriot Porters cry, And Butchers bellow, Wilkes and Liberty! As at this motley scene, in wild amaze, On every side with wondering eyes I gaze, Sudden, methought, I heard the clarion's notes; Loud on the wind the martial clamour floats!— The embattled legions glitter from afar, And threaten Fashion's dome with fatal War. Panting with rage to break her tyrant laws, Here sprightly Wit his light-arm'd cohorts draws; Reason, and Sense, with Virtue by their side, In close array, their firm battalions guide; And Beauty leads in graceful order on, Her radiant files, that glitter in the sun. The Goddess saw, and through the enamel'd red A flush of rage her glowing features spread: Then, frowning, thus: ‘Do these allies prepare ‘To wage with troops like mine unequal war?— ‘Soon shall my veterans o'er the purpled plain, ‘With force superior, drive the rebel train. ‘Though Wit, and Sense, their various bands combine, ‘And Virtue's powers with Beauty's squadrons join, ‘The boldst of their tribe shall mourn, too late, ‘The rash resolve that tempts them to their fate, ‘And bids them urge a host to warlike deeds, ‘Which Dulness marshals, and which Folly leads.’ She spoke, and while her voice the war defy'd, Assembling myriads croud on every side; Undaunted to the field of death they go, And frown amazement on the approaching foe: With dreadful shock the encount'ring armies meet, And the plain trembling, rocks beneath their feet. Ye Nymphs of Pindus! string my feeble lyre, And in my bosom wake Mæonian Fire! So shall my song, in equal strains, relate, The bleeding horrors of this field of fate. First Wit's impetuous train the fight began; Full on the foe, with active force they ran. The hardy sons of Dulness bear the shock, Sustain the onset, and their ardor mock. Secure from wounds they fight, no hostile reed Can make the sacred sons of Dulness bleed: Conceit, (whose tenfold shield's the surest fence 'Gainst all the fire of Wit, and force of Sense; In which, when held before the warrior's heart, No weapon finds a vulnerable part, But from it's temper'd verge the arrows bound, Nor leave a mark, but blunted strew the ground.) Conceit, propitious hovering o'er their heads, Before this favorite band her buckler spreads; Behind it's ample round they safely lie, And scorn the shafts of Satire, as they fly. Weak are the attempts of Reason to sustain The shatter'd force of Wit's defeated train; Alike his baffled legions quickly yield, And still victorious Dulness keeps the field. But different far the martial scene appears, Where her triumphant banner Beauty rears. Folly, and Vice, in vain their powers oppose, Wide o'er the field her car exulting goes; Before her bands the hostile legions fly, And round her shining chariot myriads die: Even Dulness learns to tremble at the sight, Draws off her conquering sons, and shuns the fight. The trembling Goddess, seis'd with deep dismay, Beheld the fatal fortune of the day: Yet one remaining band some hopes afford, To snatch the victory from her rival's sword. From various regions drawn, a troop she had, Of forms uncouth, in dress fantastic clad, The truest slaves of Fashion's potent reign, The keenest foes to Beauty's gallant train. A thousand arms they wield, and arts they know, Destructive all to their triumphant foe: Here Affectation, dress'd in fell grimace, Distorts each feature of a lovely face; Here Milliners and Mantua-makers join Their cruel skill, to hide each form divine; Above the rest, here dire Friseurs prepare Their horrid engines, and provoke the war: Ten thousand puffs advanc'd with dreadful power Against the adverse host their powder shower; The rising dust obscures the doubtful fight, And hides the struggling armies from the sight; Wide o'er the foe the gathering mist extends, Full on their fronts the snowy cloud descends. No more, by artful braidings unconfin'd, The flaxen hair flows wanton in the wind; No more the auburn tresses loosely break, In curls luxuriant, o'er the snowy neck; Alike the sable locks their lustre lose, And golden ringlets, sung by many a Muse. O'er the fair train the clouds of powder fall, And universal whiteness covers all. Her alter'd legions Beauty scarcely knows, And shrinks astonish'd from her shouting foes. So when on fam'd Pharsalia's spacious stage The world beheld her rival chiefs engage, While Rome's luxurious youth, on Pompey's side, Shining in arms, the strokes of death defied, Cæsar no more against each dauntless breast, But to their eyes, his glittering spears address'd: Those who could death in freedom's cause embrace, Struck with the terrors of a mangled face, From the disputed field inglorious fly, To 'scape the horrors of deformity. Now Fashion's breast with eager transport beats, While Beauty slowly from the field retreats: But soon her warriors blast the short delight, Assume fresh courage, and renew the fight. Each wily stratagem is us'd in vain To vanquish, or destroy, the lovely train; Though every dress to hide their charms they wear, Distort their features, and deform their hair; To every dress superior still they rise, Still darts the living lightning from their eyes: Folly beholds her fainting squadrons yield, And baffled Dulness quits at length the field. Now, Fashion, shame had veil'd thy haughty head, And Beauty reign'd triumphant in thy stead: But, lo! auxiliar armies bend their way, To rescue from her force the hard-fought day. These foreign aids, in four divisions drawn, With steady footsteps march across the lawn. Two dress'd in sable garbs their squadrons spread, Two like Britannia's legions clad in red. Amidst their ranks four frowning kings appear, And four fair queens their beauteous foreheads rear. The embattled warriors round, a dreadful fight, Pant for the conflict, and demand the fight. ‘Now haughty foes!’ (exulting Fashion cries) ‘Now learn my potent empire to despise!— ‘Though the disastrous shock of former arms ‘Had left ye blooming in your native charms; ‘No rouge had spread, no powder fall'n to shroud ‘Your dazzling lustre in a dusty cloud; ‘Not all your vaunted power should ever boast ‘One laurel ravish'd from yon veteran host. ‘Elate in arms, and foremost in the field, ‘See mighty Pam his massy halberd wield!— ‘Where-e'er, by victory led, the hero goes, ‘What daring arm, undaunted, shall oppose? ‘Or who, with fearless eye, the plain explores ‘Where dreadful march yon sable Matadores? The Goddess said.—Impatient to engage, Onward the legions rush with shouts of rage. In vain fair Beauty calls her faithless band, And bids each chief the fierce attack withstand; The apostate warriors yield without a blow, Throw down their useless arms, and kneel before the foe. In triumph now to Fashion's ample fane The jocund victors march across the plain; And Beauty, hapless victim of the war! Is chain'd a captive to her rival's car. Now joy tumultuous swell'd the Goddess' breast, And thus her voice the conquering train address'd: ‘Hail, happy chiefs! whose steady zeal alone ‘Has sav'd from ruin Fashion's tottering throne, ‘Whose arms have taught my strongest foes to yield, ‘And chas'd resistance from yon sanguine field: ‘For this exploit, your ever-honor'd band, ‘As guards perpetual, round my dome shall stand. ‘And sounding Fame, who at my palace gates, ‘Obedient on my will, for ever waits, ‘Shall with her trumpets teach the echoing wind ‘To bear this happy tale to all mankind, ‘That in each clime where-e'er my awful sway, ‘And high behests, the race of man obey, ‘Your sacred names, to all my sons endear'd, ‘Shall, as my own, be worshipp'd and rever'd. ‘Sense, Virtue, Wit, and Prudence, all combin'd, ‘No more shall win the reverence of mankind, ‘Courage, and Worth, no longer honor boast, ‘But Glory follow whom you favor most: ‘O'er Beauty, Pam shall reign despotic still, ‘Cupid resign his arrows to Spadille, ‘And all who bow to Fashion's dread awards, ‘Confess the universal power of Cards.’ SHOOTING. A POEM. ? VOLANS LIQUIDIS IN NUBIBUS ARSIT,— SIGNAVITQUE VIAM FLAMMIS ? VIRGIL. Ye sylvan muses! as my step invades The deep recesses of your hallow'd shades, Say will ye bid your echoing caves prolong The harsher cadence of your votary's song? Not anxious now to strike the trembling wire, Sweetly responsive to your vernal choir; Or from the treasur'd stores of earth to bring The fragrant produce of the roseate spring: Mine the rude task, while summer's fading ray To yellow autumn yields the shortening day, And all the variegated woods appear Clad in the glories of the withering year, With dogs and fiery weapons to profane The peaceful sabbath of your rural reign; Your desolated regions to explore 'Mid the wild tempest, and the season frore; Destruction on your feather'd race to pour, And add new horrors to the wintry hour. 'Twas thine, immortal Somerville! to trace The livelier raptures of the joyful chace, O'er hills and dales to urge, with eager speed, The hound sagacious, and the panting steed; And guide the labors of the enthusiast throng With all the extatic energy of song.— Severer care these calmer lays demand, And Fancy curb'd by sage Instruction's hand: Yet, for the Muse some scatter'd charms shall gleam 'Mid the rich chaos of this copious theme; Yet, here shall Glory view with generous aim, The rising elements of martial fame. As from the chace Britannia's youth shall learn The docile steed with ready hand to turn; O'er the rude crag his bounding steps to guide, Or press his ardor down the mountain's side, Till, rushing to the field with fierce delight, She sends forth other This gallant Officer, who was killed in one of the descents on the coast of France, during the war before last, was very instrumental in first forming the Light Horse of this country. Lindseys to the fight: So shall the steady train, of careful eye, Who wound th' aerial offspring as they fly, Whose limbs unwearied keep the constant way, From morn's first opening dawn, till parting day, Manly and firm, an unexhausted race, With hardy frames the shining phalanx grace; With steps, by labor unsubdu'd, shall know Incessant to pursue the fainting foe; Shall, 'midst the rocks and woods, with active toil Hang o'er his march, and all his movements foil; Their close platoons, with cool and certain aim, Shall send destruction forth in vollied flame: Or o'er the field dispers'd, each shot they pour Shall mark some hostile victim's fatal hour. Of old, ere man with imitative skill, Taught mimic thunders to obey his will, Train'd by superior care, the elastic yew With sinewy arm, our English bowmen drew: The warlike art exulting Albion saw Protected by the fostering hand of law; Attentive See 33 Hen. VIII. ch. 9. senates watch'd, with anxious zeal, This martial bulwark of the general weal; The rules they order'd, or the prize they gave, Compell'd the slothful, and inflam'd the brave; And oft her archer-sons would trophies wear From Gallia's cross-bow won, and Scotia's spear. Nor let the frown of literary pride, Or false refinement's sneer, my labors chide: Not all are form'd with unremitting view Pale study's restless labors to pursue: Not all their hours are dull enough to waste In the void round of fashionable taste; Nor can the gentle airings, which engage The fainter wish of languor, and of age, From his pursuits the sanguine votary draw Of wealth, of joy, of wisdom, or of law, Till slow disease demands the leach's care, Sad substitute for exercise and air! The impatient youth, whom manly vigor fires, Ruddy with health, and stung by wild desires; By active sports alone can soothe to rest The boiling fervors of his panting breast. Nor shall Britannia's patriots blame the cause, To woods and fields her wealthier chiefs that draws. Let Gallia's sons to rural scenes resort Only when exil'd from a partial court, Whose dearest hopes a Monarch's favor crown, Rais'd by his smile, or blasted by his frown; But Albion's freer lords must try to gain The unbiass'd suffrage of her rustic train. And every tie that binds her nobler band, With dearer love, to their paternal land, Her yeomen shall behold with grateful eye, A surer pledge of wealth and liberty. Come then, ye hardy youths, who wish to save By generous labor powers that nature gave! Who fly from languor, hush'd in dread repose Beneath the leaves of sloth's enchanting rose, Glad on the upland brow, or echoing vale, To drink new vigor from the morning gale;— Come! and the Muse shall shew you how to foil By sports of skill the tedious hours of toil; The healthful lessons of the field impart, And careful teach the rudiments of art. When the last sun of August's fiery reign Now bathes his radiant forehead in the main, The panoply by sportive heroes worn Is rang'd in order for the ensuing morn; Forth from the summer guard of bolt and lock Comes the thick guêtre, and the fustian frock; With curious skill, the deathful tube is made Clean as the firelock of the spruce parade: Yet, let no polish of the sportsman's gun Flash like the soldier's weapon to the sun, Or the bright steel's refulgent glare presume To penetrate the peaceful forest's gloom; But let it take the brown's more sober hue, Or the dark lustre of the enamell'd blue. Let the close pouch the wadded tow contain, The leaden pellets, and the nitrous grain; And wisely cautious, with preventive care, Be the spare flint, and ready turnscrew there; While the slung net is open to receive Each prize the labors of the day shall give. Yet oft the experienc'd shooter will deride This quaint exactness of fastidious pride; In some old coat that whilom charm'd the eye, Till time had worn it into slovenry, His dusky weapon, all by rust conceal'd, Through rainy service in the sportive field, He issues to the plain, secure to kill, And founds his glory on superior skill. The night recedes, and mild Aurora now Waves her gray banner on the eastern brow; Light float the misty vapors o'er the sky, And dim the blaze of Phœbus' garish eye; The flitting breeze just stirs the rustling brake, And curls the crystal surface of the lake; The expectant sportsmen, urg'd by anxious haste, Snatch the refreshment of a short repast, Their weapons seize, their pointers call around, And sally forth impatient to the ground. Here where the yellow wheat away is drawn, And the thick stubble clothes the russet lawn, Begin the sport.—Eager and unconfin'd As when stern Æolus unchains the wind, The active pointer, from his thong unbound, Impatient dashes o'er the dewy ground, With glowing eye, and undulating tail, Ranges the field, and snuffs the tainted gale; Yet, 'midst his ardor, still his master fears, And the restraining whistle careful hears. So when Britannia's watchful navies sweep, In freedom's awful cause, the hostile deep, Though the brave warrior panting to engage, And loose on England's foes his patriot rage, The tempest's howling fury deems too slow To fill his sails, and waft him to the foe; Yet, 'mid the fiery conflict, if he spy From the high mast his leader's signal fly, To the command obedience instant pays, And martial order martial courage sways. See how exact they try the stubble o'er, Quarter the field, and every turn explore; Now sudden wheel, and now attentive seize The known advantage of the opposing breeze.— At once they stop!—yon' careful dog descries Where close and near the lurking covey lies. His caution mark, lest even a breath betray The impending danger to his timid prey; In various attitudes around him stand, Silent and motionless, the attending band. So when the son of Danae and Jove, Crown'd by gay conquest and successful love, Saw Phineus and his frantic rout invade The festive rights by Hymen sacred made, To the rude Bacchanals his arm outspread The horrid image of Medusa's head; Soon as the locks their snaky curls disclose, A marble stiffness seiz'd his threatening foes; Fix'd were the eyes that mark'd the javelin thrown, And each stern warrior rear'd his lance in stone. Now by the glowing cheek and heaving breast Is expectation's sanguine wish express'd.— Ah curb your headlong ardor! nor refuse Patient to hear the precepts of the Muse. Sooner shall noisy heat in rash dispute The reasoning calm of placid sense confute; Sooner the headlong rout's misguided rage With the firm phalanx equal combat wage, Than the warm youth, whom anxious hopes inflame, Pursue the fleeting mark with steady aim. By temperate thought your glowing passions cool, And bow the swelling heart to reason's rule; Else when the whirring pinion, as it flies, Alarms your startled ear, and dazzled eyes, Unguided by the cautious arm of care, Your random bolts shall waste their force in air. They rise!—they rise!—Ah yet your fire restrain, Till the scar'd birds securer distance gain; For, thrown too close, the shots your hopes elude, Wide of your aim, and innocent of blood; But mark with careful eye their lessening flight, Your ready gun, obedient to your sight, And at the length where frequent trials shew Your fatal weapon gives the surest blow, Draw quick!—yet steady care with quickness join, Lest the shock'd barrel deviate from the line; So shall success your ardent wishes pay, And sure destruction wait the flying prey. As glory more than gain allures the brave To dare the combat loud, and louder wave; So the ambition of the sportsman lies More in the certain shot than bleeding prize. While poachers, mindful of the festal hour, Among the covey random slaughter pour; And, as their numbers press the crimson'd ground, Regardless reck not of the secret wound, Which borne away, the wretched victims lie 'Mid silent shades to languish and to die. O let your breast such selfish views disclaim, And scorn the triumph of a casual aim: Not urg'd by rapine, but of honor proud, One object single from the scattering croud; So, when you see the destin'd quarry down, Shall just applause your skilful labor crown. If your staunch dogs require no instant toil To rescue from their jaws the fluttering spoil, Re-load your fatal piece with prudent zeal, While glows with recent flame the smoaking steel; So the black grain shall kindling warmth acquire, And take the flinty spark with readier fire; Or if some scatter'd bird, that lay behind, Sudden should rise, and fleet away on wind, You check her rapid course, nor murmuring stand, Your empty weapon useless in your hand. Now some observant eye has mark'd their flight, And seen dispers'd the weary'd covey light; Soon to the spot the ranging pointer drawn, Explores with tender nose the tainted lawn, Where, to his nicer sense, their fumes betray The secret ambush of the fearful prey. With cautious action now, and stealthful pace, His careful steps pursue the running race; Now fix'd he stands, now moves with doubtful tread, Stopp'd by their pause, or by their motion led, Till, rooted by the sheltering hedge, his feet Declare the trembling victim's last retreat. But as, with beating breasts, on either side The impatient youths the pleasing task divide, And in the row between, the lurking game Lies hid from sight, ah, careful be the aim! Lest, skreen'd and parted by the thorny mound, The erring shots should give a fatal wound, And change the jocund sportsman's verdant wreath For funeral weeds, for mourning, tears, and death. In Lydian plains, where rich Pactolus roll'd Through groves of perfume, and o'er sands of gold, Crœsus, of Asia's lords the proudest name, Shar'd every gift of fortune, and of fame; So wide his empire, and so vast his store, That avarice and ambition ask'd no more; Though blest in these, the dearer bliss he knows With which a parent's happy bosom glows, For not the fairest image ever dress'd In the fond wishes of a father's breast, By flattery swell'd, could mate the virtuous praise To Atys' worth that truth unbiass'd pays. At war's loud clarion if the nations bled, Conquest his armies crown'd if Atys led; If the rude waves of civil discord broke, Hush'd was the rising storm if Atys spoke; His lenient voice bade loud rebellion cease, And charm'd contending factions into peace: Nor less his care domestic knew to bring Joy to his sire, than safety to his king; Nor was the patriot's glory priz'd above The dearer charity of filial love. While prosperous scenes the monarch's thoughts beguile, Too little warn'd of Fortune's transient smile, 'Mid the dark moments of the boding night A horrid vision seem'd to meet his sight, With dying mien his Atys stood confess'd, Transfix'd by horrid steel his bleeding breast.— Swift from his couch he starts, while wild despair Contracts his eye-balls, and uplifts his hair. In vain the orient morn's reviving power Chas'd the pale phantoms of the midnight hour; The recollected scene his peace annoys, Sinks in his heart, and poisons all his joys; Around him visionary falchions gleam In act to realize his dreadful dream; And if by chance loud rumor wafts from far Uncertain clamors of intended war, His laboring breast foretels the fatal deed, And sees in fancied fights his Atys bleed. What shall his fears invent, or how control The generous ardor of the hero's soul?— His mind to gentler thoughts he tries to move, And conquer strong renown by stronger love. The fairest maid of Lydia's glowing dames, Whose beauteous form the manly youth inflames, With eastern roses crown'd, is blushing led In Hymeneal pomp, to Atys' bed. To cares of empire, and to toils of fight, Succeed the festal day, and genial night: Soft Pleasure spreads around her blooming flow'rs, And wanton Cupid leads the laughing hours. Amid these joys, from Mysia's subject plain, Before the throne, behold a suppliant train! ‘O mighty prince!’ they cry, ‘we now repair ‘To claim the aid of thy paternal care; ‘A savage monster of portentous size, ‘Whose cruel strength our utmost force defies, ‘Ranges our fields, spreads devastation round, ‘And roots the unripen'd harvest from the ground. ‘O, let thy youths, to range the woods who know, ‘Attend with faithful dogs, and twanging bow; ‘In his dire haunts the fierce invader brave, ‘Repel his fury, and thy subjects save. ‘Perhaps the prince.’—The eager monarch, here, Urg'd by the influence of parental fear, Arrests their speech: ‘My arms, my youths shall go, ‘Your terrors quell, and check this savage foe; ‘But for my son, him other cares employ, ‘And the soft scenes of Hymeneal joy, ‘Nor must the rugged chace, or dubious fight, ‘Mar the sweet transports of the nuptial rite.’ He ceas'd; attentive round the Mysian band, Pleas'd with the promis'd aid, submissive stand. Not so the prince, his ardent bosom glows To burst the silken bands of still repose. ‘Ah! what, my sire,’ he cries, ‘has Atys done? ‘What sad distrust awaits your hapless son, ‘That thus immers'd in sloth you keep him far ‘From fields of glory, and from toils of war? ‘For love's soft raptures though the hero burn, ‘Yet fame and danger claim their wonted turn. ‘How shall I meet, involv'd in this disgrace, ‘The indignant murmurs of your warrior race? ‘How will, with tears of silent scorn, my bride ‘Her alter'd lord's inglorious safety chide! ‘O give my wishes way, or let me hear ‘The hidden source of this injurious fear.’ This earnest prayer the smother'd secret draws, And the sad Monarch owns the latent cause: When Atys, smiling:—‘How shall I reprove ‘The fond excesses of paternal love, ‘Though for my undeserving life is shown ‘A nice regard you never paid your own? ‘But shall the heir of Crœsus' martial name ‘Inglorious life prefer to glorious fame?— ‘Life is a bliss, when crown'd by virtue's meed, ‘And death a prize, when honor bids us bleed; ‘Omens and dreams in vain the purpose stay ‘When duty calls, and glory points the way. ‘Or grant some god the vision sent, yet here ‘Vain are your cares, and useless is your fear; ‘Transfix'd by steel my bleeding breast you saw, ‘Not torn and mangled by a bestial jaw; ‘Then let me go, and when you meet your son ‘Clad in the shaggy spoils his arms have won, ‘The shadowy phantoms of the night shall cease ‘To haunt your slumbers, and disturb your peace.’ The Monarch hears, and with reluctant eyes Gives the consent his boding heart denies; His brow a placid guise dissembling wears, While Reason vainly combats stronger fears. It chanced a youth of Phrygia's royal train, His hand polluted by a brother slain, Exil'd by vengeance from his native ground, In Crœsus' peaceful court a refuge found; Where oft would Atys' gentler care impart The balm of friendship to his wounded heart; To him the wretched king in secret spoke, While tears and sighs his faltering accents choke; ‘If, brave Adrastus, thy oppressive woes ‘In Sardis' sheltering walls have found repose, ‘If here the expiating rite renew'd ‘Has paid the forfeit for fraternal blood, ‘If pity's tear, if friendship's lenient balm ‘Have tried with studious zeal thy griefs to calm, ‘Go with my son, and by attentive care ‘Partake his labors, and his dangers share. ‘Shield him from peril that my soul alarms, ‘And bring him back in safety to my arms.’ To whom the youth: ‘Oft has my ready breast ‘Panted to ask the office you request, ‘As oft my conscious shame that wish restrain'd, ‘Disgraced by exile, and by murder stain'd: ‘Since you command, your Atys I'll attend, ‘Obey my patron, and protect my friend; ‘Watch o'er his safety in the doubtful strife, ‘Or ransom with my own his dearer life.’ Now to the Mysian fields elate and gay The eager warriors bend their jocund way, The echoing hills and forest walks resound With shouts of men, and chidings of the hound. Rous'd from his lair, and issuing on the plain, Forth bursts the monster on the hunter train, Around the circling youths impatient stand, And launch their steely darts with ready hand. Too rashly eager as the Phrygian threw, With erring aim the pointed jav'lin flew, In Atys' breast the quivering weapon stood, And drank with fatal barbs his vital blood.— The mournful shrieks that rent the ambient air, The weeping troops, Adrastus' loud despair; The silent agony, the gushing tide Of the sad parent, and the widow'd bride, The plaints they utter, and the woes they feel, No heart can image, and no tongue reveal. As the ill-fated youth is borne along, All pale and bleeding, through the groaning throng, By the cold corse Adrastus' frantic cries, Death in his voice, and horror in his eyes; ‘Why have the gods in partial vengeance shed ‘Their choicest curses on my wretched head? ‘Fated the keenest strokes of wrath to prove, ‘And doom'd to murder those whom most I love! ‘O much wrong'd sire, let thy avenging hand ‘Expiate by guilty blood this weeping land: ‘Be on my heart thy instant fury hurl'd, ‘And save from future parricide the world!’ ‘Alas, my son!' the wretched King replied, ‘'Tis awful Jove who thus corrects my pride, ‘Which, crown'd by conquest, and with power elate, ‘It's fortune deem'd beyond the reach of fate. ‘Alas! too late repentant, now I find ‘The fleeting happiness of human kind! ‘My hopes, my cares are past! this cruel blow ‘Has laid at once my vain ambition low; ‘The offended gods this chastisement have given, ‘Thou but the fatal instrument of heaven.’ Silent the youth withdrew, till sad were paid The tributary rites to Atys' shade: Then, as chill midnight's dreary hours return, Weeping he sought the monumental urn: ‘Atys!’ he cried, ‘behold Adrastus come ‘A willing victim to thy hallow'd tomb!— ‘This erring hand, the fatal stroke that gave, ‘Shall lay thy murderer breathless on thy grave.’ Then pierced with sudden arm his struggling breast, And on the blood-stain'd marble sunk to rest. As more obliquely on autumnal skies With milder force October's suns arise, The purple pheasant tempts the youth to rove With well-train'd spaniels through the faded grove. See how with emulative zeal they strive, Thrid the loose sedge, and through the thicket drive! Not ranging lawless o'er the forest wide, But close attendant on their master's side; No babbling voice the bosom falsely warms, Or swells the panting heart with vain alarms, Till all at once their choral tongues proclaim The secret refuge of the lurking game; Loud on the breeze the chearful clamor floats, And the high wood re-echoes with their notes. Swift is their course, no lengthen'd warnings now Space to collect the scatter'd thoughts allow, No wary pointer shews the cautious eyes Where from his russet couch the bird shall rise: Perhaps light running o'er the mossy ground, His devious steps your sanguine hopes confound; Or, by the tangled branches hid from sight, Sudden he wings his unexpected flight. No open view along the uncumber'd field To the cool aim will time and distance yield; But the nice circumstance will oft demand The quickest eye-sight and the readiest hand, Swift as he rises from the thorny brake, With instant glance the fleeting mark to take, And with prompt arm the transient moment seize, 'Mid the dim gloom of intervening trees. His gaudy plumage when the male displays In bright luxuriance to the solar rays, Arrest with hasty shot his whirring speed, And see unblam'd the shining victim bleed; But when the hen to thy discerning view Her sober pinion spreads of duskier hue, The attendant keeper's prudent warning hear, And spare the offspring of the future year; Else shall the fine which custom laid of old Avenge her slaughter by thy forfeit gold. Soon as the ready dogs their quarry spring, And swift he spreads his variegated wing, Ceas'd is their cry, with silent look they wait Till the loud gun decides the event of fate; Nor, if the shots are thrown with erring aim, And proudly soars away the unwounded game, Will the staunch train pursue him as he flies With useless speed, and unavailing cries. And now when cloudy skies and drizzling rains Swell the full springs, and drench the moisten'd plains, The extended space of land and ocean cross'd From the bleak scenes of Hyperborean frost, With active wing the unwearied Woodcocks fly To southern climates, and a milder sky, The osier'd borders of the brook explore, And with deep bills the forest marshes bore. Where now matur'd yon slender ashes stand, Rise from their stools and tempt the woodman's hand, Where the loose trunks admit the partial ray Along the border take your cautious way. Here let your care the shorten'd gun employ, Lest the thick boughs the purpos'd aim annoy; Let super-added steel with pressure sure, From the dank drip the shelter'd pan secure: And as the silent bird the stems among Wheels slow his desultory flight along, With steady eye his wavering motion watch, And through the parting trees the advantage catch; Though distant be the shot, the slightest wound Shall lay the fluttering victim on the ground. Rous'd by the spaniel, 'midst the forest shade, Behold the trembling Leveret cross the glade! If round the extended plains yield ample space, Or for the rapid course, or chearful chace, O, sacred be her steps! nor let thy hand Blast the fair hopes of a congenial band, Or for a transient pleasure meanly foil The lengthen'd transport of the hunter's toil; But where steep hills and spacious woodlands rise, Or the long flight the frequent copse denies, Blameless arrest her rapid flight, nor spare The timid victim for the inglorious snare. Where shining rills with copious moisture feed The deeper verdure of the irriguous mead, Or where between the purple heaths is seen The mossy bosom of the low ravine, The fearful Snipes, hid from the searching eye, 'Mid the dank sedge and nodding rushes lie. With sudden turns oblique, when first they rise, As from the weaver's arm the shuttle flies They shape their wavering course: but patient stay Till, with securer wing, they soar away: Then as aloft their outstretch'd pinions sail, Borne on the bosom of the buoyant gale, The fatal shot sent forth with cautious sight, Shall bring them wheeling from their towering height. When winter now, a gloomy tyrant, reigns In dreadful silence o'er the ravaged plains, Involves in sheets of snow the bending woods, And throws his icy mantle o'er the floods, Close by the harden'd brook, whose sullen stream No more soft murmuring aids the poet's dream, Where, 'midst the matted sedge, the emerging flood With air and life renews the finny brood, The patient fowler stands with silent aim To watch the station of the watery game: Not like the gentle angler, careless laid, In the cool shelter of the summer shade, But train'd with hardy sinews to defy The chilling keenness of a wintry sky; While here the aquatic Wild-fowl's timid race With wonted pinion seek the well known place; Where rushes thick the Widgeon's haunt conceal, The blue-wing'd Mallard, and the tenderer Teal; Swift on the various race, in fiery shower, The scattering shots unseen destruction pour, With mingled slaughter strew the frost-bound flood, And dye the sullied snow with gushing blood. Such are the sports that fertile Albion yields, Such the wing'd inmates of her milder fields; But bounteous Nature, with diffusive hand, Spreads wide her various produce o'er the land, Each different region marks with nurturing care, And bids a race congenial flourish there. A tribe peculiar by her power is plac'd On the drear mountain, and the howling waste, Which art and industry would rear in vain, Or in the shelter'd vale, or cultur'd plain. Hence wandering far from England's gentler scene, Her spacious champains, and her pastures green, The hardy youth will Cambria's cliffs explore, Or climb the heights of Caledonia hoar, The Grouse and sable Heath-cock to pursue Where moors unbounded tire the sated view, And sullen silence reigns, save where the tide Pours in swoln torrents from the mountain's side; While summer suns in full effulgence shed Their burning fervors on the throbbing head. Thus has my verse in humble strains reveal'd The various pleasures of the sportive field, And shewn the different labors of the day As the revolving seasons roll away: But vainly shall preceptive rules impart A perfect knowledge of this manly art; Practice alone can certain skill produce, And theory confirm'd by constant use. As well the stripling of the gay parade, Proud of his silken sash and smart cockade, Though taught by wise instructors to explore The martial depth of mathematic lore, Might hope to drive Victoria's crimson car Triumphant o'er the bleeding ranks of war, Ere the long march, the early toil, and late, The frequent scenes of danger and of fate, The fervor of the glowing breast allay, Change ardor's blaze for valor's temperate ray, And teach the mind, unruffled and serene, To keep her powers 'mid horrors wildest scene. The hardy youth who pants with eager flame To send his leaden bolts with certain aim, Must ne'er with disappointed hopes recoil From cold and heat, from hunger and from toil, Must climb the hill, must tread the marshy glade, Or force the passage through the opposing shade, Must range untam'd by Sol's meridian power, And brave the force of winter's keenest hour, Till industry and time their work have wrought, And honor crown the skill that labor taught. Yet some, these harsher rudiments to spare, And equal art with easier toil to share, Or watch with careful aim and ready sight The swallow-wheeling in her summer flight, Or on some lofty cliff, whose chalky steep Hangs with rude brow impending o'er the deep, Where gulls and screaming sea-mews haunt the rock, Pour fire incessant on the mingled flock. But vain their hopes—presented to the eye In such diversive lines the objects fly, The dazzled sight unnumber'd marks pursues, And shifts it's aim, uncertain which to chuse; Decision quick and calm, the shooter's boast, By frequent change, is check'd, confus'd, and lost, And, guarded by irresolute delay, Utouch'd shall future coveys fleet away. More hurtful still to try with distant blow To bring the percher from th' aerial bough. How shall his thoughts the level that prepare With all the caution of mechanic care, Exact and steady as the sage's eye Through Galileo's tube surveys the sky, With ready view the transient object seize, Swift as the motion of the rapid breeze, Pursue the uncertain mark with swift address, And catch the fleeting moment of success? Ere yet the Muse her lay preceptive end Ye eager youths these friendly rules attend: 'Tis not enough, that cautious aim, and sure, From erring shots your brave compeers secure, That prudence guard those ills which erst might flow From the wing'd javelin, and the sounding bow; For on the gun unnumber'd dangers wait, And various forms of unexpected fate. Drawn thro' the thorny hedge, the uncertain lock May give with sudden spring, a deadly shock; Or the loose spark the rapid flash may raise, And wrap the sulphurous dust in instant blaze. 'Tis hence the military race prepare The novice youth with such assiduous care, And teach him with punctilious art to wield The weighty fire-lock in the embattled field. Though some may deem the attention urg'd too far, As the mere pomp and circumstance of war; When closely wedg'd the firm battalions stand, Rank press'd on rank, and band impelling band, Did not fastidious zeal with cautious plan Define each act, and every motion scan, Oft would the bullets 'mid the battles roar The thirsty herbage die with friendly gore, And oft the dangerous weapon's kindling breath Change fields of exercise, to fields of death. Behold yon' eager race who o'er the plain, With stimulating heel and loosen'd rein, Their panting coursers urge to leave behind The rapid currents of the northern wind, Though, as with headlong rage they rush along, Impending dangers seem to wait the throng; Though accident with more apparent face Seem to attend the ardor of the chace; Yet, 'mid these calmer sports, with ghastly mien The pallid form of slaughter lurks unseen; And while the hunter checks his bold career To pour on Russel's tomb the sorrowing tear, The sportive train who haunt the fatal glades Where hoary Camus flows by Granta's shades, Shall weep the unexpected blow that gave Their much-lov'd Cotton to a timeless grave. Lamented youth! when erst on Warley's plains We led in radiant arms our rustic swains, What time Britannia, friendless and forlorn, Her shores expos'd, her naval trophies torn, Bold in her native vigor dar'd oppose Rebellious subjects, and combining foes; In vain thy generous bosom burn'd to stand The manly bulwark of an injur'd land, Or nobly bleeding by the hostile ball, In freedom's, and in Albion's cause to fall; Doom'd by relentless fate, to press the ground, The unhappy victim of a casual wound. Votaries of rural joy! with mine while flow Your kindred streams of sympathetic woe, By salutary care, ah! learn to shun The hidden dangers of the unguarded gun! And, as in fields of pleasure you acquire The soldier's manly toil and steady fire, His cautious use of arms attentive heed, Careful by no inglorious wound to bleed, Nor lavish life, but in the sacred cause Of Britain's injur'd rights, and violated laws. AEROPHORION This little Poem was written on seeing Mr. Sadler, the first English Aeronaut, ascend in his Balloon from the Physic Garden in Oxford, in November 1784.. A POEM. When bold Ambition tempts the ingenuous mind To leave the beaten paths of life behind, Sublime on Glory's pinions to arise, Urg'd by the love of manly enterprize; Swol'n Indolence and Fear, with envious view The radiant track incessant will pursue, The sneer of Malice to the croud will teach, And mock those labors they despair to reach. Nor does the bold Adventurer dread alone The poison'd shafts by scowling Envy thrown; For deck'd in Wisdom's garb pedantic Pride, And pompous Dulness constant to her side, Shall try with looks profound each new design By the strict rules of Compass and of Line, And damn the Scheme, whose Author can't produce The exact returns of profit and of use. Far be it from the Muse with Siren song To draw from useful toil the industrious throng, Or o'er the serious arts of life to raise Warm Speculation's yet unsanction'd praise. Earth's genial lap who teaches to unfold A richer store of vegetable gold, Who knows in union's closer bands to draw The opposing claims of Liberty and Law, Who dares in Freedom's holy cause to brave The adverse legion and the hostile wave, Shall gain from Virtue's breath a purer fame Than all the Poet or the Sage can claim. Yet, led by Science, they whose steps explore Each deep resource of Nature's hidden store; Whether pale study prompt them to reveal What wonderous scenes her shapes minute conceal, Or with superior zeal and bolder toil, Which danger cannot check, or labor foil, They trace her giant form and march sublime Through each vicissitude of soil and clime, Shall surely there some treasur'd secrets find, Parents of good and useful to mankind, Which far conceal'd from vulgar eye-sight lay Till active Science call'd them into day. When first sage Mathesis those laws reveal'd Which lead the Stars thro' Heaven's eternal field, What prescience could foresee their course should guide The future vessel through the unfathom'd tide? Does Botany collect her flowers in vain Without one lenient herb to soften pain? And has the Muse still pour'd an empty lay, Nor charm'd one vagrant foot to virtue's way? Or grant that Science, of her stores profuse, Forsake awhile her toils of graver use, Yet sure no vulgar joys his breast engage Who reads the wonders of her awful page, Pursues the paths by former Sages trod, Which lead thro' Nature's works, to Nature's God: Now follows Vegetation's varied powers, Thro' all the change of foliage, fruit, and flowers, Now feels the electric spark with sudden flame Shoot mimic lightning through his thrilling frame, And now delights the etheraal orbs to trace Amid the vast expanse of boundless space. Hail then ye daring few! who proudly soar Through paths by mortal eye unview'd before! From earth and all her humble scenes who rise To search the extended mansions of the skies. If firm his breast who first undaunted gave His fragile vessel to the stormy wave, How much superior he! whose buoyant car Borne through the strife of elemental war, Driven by the veering wind's uncertain tide, No helm to steer him, and no oar to guide, See Earth's stupendous regions spread below, To hillocks shrunk the mountains loftiest brow. Who now his head sublime, astonish'd shrouds In the dull gloom of rain-distended clouds, And sits enthron'd mid solitude and shade Which human eye-sight never can pervade, Or rides amidst the howling tempest's force Tracing the volley'd lightning to it's source, Or proudly rising o'er the lagging wind Leaves all the jarring Atmosphere behind, And at his feet, while spreading clouds extend, While thunders bellow, and while storms descend, Feels on his head the enlivening sun-beams play, And drinks in skies serene the unsullied stream of day. And say ye gloomy Cynics who despise The manly labors of the brave and wise, Who damp with envious breath the generous fires Which Science kindles and which Fame inspires, Yet Hell's remotest regions would explore If the rich mine allur'd with proffer'd ore. Say can ye tell what this, yet novel art, May to the future race of man impart, What wonders hence may to our sons be shewn, Truths now untaught, and blessings yet unknown? Tempted by cloudless skies, yet half afraid, When first the novice mariner essay'd On the frail raft the border to forsake To try the bosom of the unruffled lake; Grasping with trembling hand the ill-form'd oar, And scarcely venturing from the lessening shore, While shouting crouds applauding rent the skies, And weeping matrons blam'd the bold emprize: Had some enthusiast bosom then foretold What wonderous scenes the invention should unfold, That Ocean sway'd by this improving Art Should join those coasts it's billows seem'd to part, Bear the stupendous Bark in safety o'er, And every produce waft to every shore; Had talk'd of climes by future Navies cross'd From scenes of Arctic to Antarctic frost, And regions open'd to the astonish'd sight Beyond Imagination's wildest flight; Such credit had he gain'd, as now would gain The sanguine votary from the sneering train, Whose hopes should promise from the improv'd balloon Planets explor'd, and Empires of the Moon. Then while the sons of Gallia justly claim The earliest trophies in this field of fame, Shall Albion's race with impotence of Pride Not emulate their triumphs, but deride? No! while they candid own their Rivals here Have started first in Glory's bright career, Let generous ardor fire each kindred soul To join their footsteps ere they reach the goal. And while the Wealthy and the Great combine United Patrons of this bold design, The applauding Muse her garlands shall bestow To crown the intrepid Youth's successful brow, Who first of Britain's offspring dar'd to rise Upborne by native Genius to the skies, New laurels rais'd on Isis' learned plain, And taught her osier'd brink to rival Seine. ON THE WRECK OF THE HALSEWELL. A FRAGMENT. Now the loud winds with angry pinions sweep The laboring bosom of the stormy deep, The face of day o'erspread by vapors scowls, And 'mid the shrowds the increasing tempest howls, O'er the tall mast the giant surges rise, And a new Chaos mingles earth and skies; Bold even in danger's face, the naval train Exert their force, and try their art in vain; Despair and Death on all their efforts lower, And the loud tempest mocks their feeble power. Large and more large the threatening rocks appear, And every billow brings their fate more near.— Steep Purbeck's chalky cliffs, whose welcome sight So oft have fill'd the bosom with delight, When, as from hostile coasts and distant skies The wave-worn mariner, returning, spies Their well-known summits with exulting eyes, Renews each scene with thoughts domestic dear, And wets the cheek with joy's o'er raptur'd tear, Now in the dreadful garb of terror dress'd Freeze life's warm tide, and chill the shuddering breast; And the lov'd shore that life, that freedom gave, Now sinks her sons beneath the whelming wave. So Jason's infant race, a suppliant train, Around their frantic mother cling in vain, Hang on the parent bosom that supplied Their earliest nurture with it's milky tide; On all their pangs she smiles with savage joy, And her own hands her hated race destroy. Full on the shore the giddy vessel drives, And the rude shock her solid timbers rives, The lashing wave her batter'd planks divides, And o'er her deck the sea resistless rides.— Say shall no voice in pitying strains relate The hardy mariner's untimely fate, Who oft Britannia's streaming flag unfurl'd To the wild inmates of the Southern world, Or with bold prow the hostile fleet explor'd When louder than the surge the battle roar'd? Yes! yes! to them the sorrowing Muse shall pay The votive tribute of a mournful lay: Yet while she pours the unavailing tear Some transient gleams the night of horror chear. For scenes that frequent shapes of Death impart Arm the firm breast, and steel the manly heart; And he who oft has seen his ghastly form Glare in the fight, and thunder in the storm, Will with bold arm his tyrant force engage, And while he combats mitigates his rage. Not such the means to check the awful doom When Youth and Beauty meet the watery tomb: Where those mild graces partial Nature gave To sooth the labors of the wise, and brave, Soften'd by all that fond assiduous care Which every bosom gives the young, and fair, Each kind attention warm affection pays, The Parent's fondness, and the Lover's praise, Teach Sensibility's resistless glow To raise each fear, and double every woe. Say how shall they, whose eye's averted sight Shrinks trembling from the phantom of affright, While Art inventive skreens each lovely form Or from the sultry ray, or chilling storm; Say how shall they with gentle bosoms brave The rushing torrent of the delug'd wave, Where Death's pale shape in heighten'd terrors dress'd Strikes icy horror through the firmest breast? What language can describe, what colors shew, Each varied form of terror and of woe?— With pallid features, and dishevell'd hair, In all the agony of dumb despair, Here on the deck the wretched victim lies, And views approaching death with lifted eyes. Here piercing cries drown'd by the sounding main Invoke an absent mother's aid in vain. Here stony fear arrests the laboring breath, And dread, anticipates the stroke of death. This on the crew her eye attentive throws To try if hope one distant ray bestows. And see supreme in sorrow and distress The wretched sire his trembling daughters press, Now down his cheeks the streaming torrents roll, And speak the bitter anguish of his soul; And now parental care his face beguiles, And hides his heartfelt pangs in transient smiles, Throws a faint sunshine o'er the brow of care, And gilds with hope the horror of despair.— Heavens!—that soul-piercing shriek!—the conflict's o'er, Hush'd are their cries, their bosoms beat no more; Sad, silent, all, save where the wild winds urge The sullen fury of the heaving surge; And, floating lifeless, see each beauteous form Drives a pale corse before the ruthless storm. Even the stern mariner whose doubtful hand Just grasps the summit of the wish'd for land, While scarce his thoughts the sense of safety know, Escap'd from rocks above, and waves below, Amid the conflict keen of hope and fear Hears their last cries still vibrate in his ear, Feels their keen anguish 'midst his dearest strife, And mourns their sufferings while he pants for life. THE PARSONAGE IMPROVED. A POEM. I Where gentle Deva's lucid waters glide In slow meanders thro' the winding vale, And fertile Cestria's pastures green divide; Deep in the bosom of a sheltering dale By uplands guarded from the wintry gale, In rustic site a lowly village stands, Not laid in form exact with artful scale, But scatter'd wide by Chance's careless hands 'Mid woods, and breezy hills, and lawns, and fallow'd lands. II Here by the verdant margin of the flood 'Mid osiers dank the humble cottage lies, And here emerging from the bowering wood From chimnies low the curling steams arise, Here on the heath adorn'd with purple dyes The open casement drinks the ambrosial air, While pointing boldly to the ambient skies, The taper steeple marks the house of prayer, Where to the holy rite the village race repair. III Here erst a simple fabric might you see, The peaceful mansion of the Parish Priest: Though unadorn'd with costly symmetry No splendid portal woo'd the noble guest, Yet from his lowly door the gentle breast Was never by unfeeling menace driven, While Charity in robe of ermine dress'd Beheld her scanty offerings freely given; Nor shall her smallest boon escape the eye of heaven. IV Though proud Magnificence with splendid arm Had here no vast superfluous pomp display'd, Yet Neatness was at hand with simpler charm, And each domestic comfort lent it's aid. Though no extended lawns, no forest-shade Struck with astonishment the enchanted sight, Yet the small spot in Beauty stood array'd, Since all around by Husbandry was dight, For well such cultur'd scenes the placid sense delight. V Right to the golden sun's meridian ray Healthful, and gay, the chearful front was placed: Where no Acanthus twin'd with mimic spray To crown the column of Corinthian taste; By the soft tendrils of the vine embraced O'er the slop'd roof the vivid shoots extend, Now with festoons of leaves luxuriant graced, And now, as Autumn's ripening beams descend, Loaded with swelling fruit, the purple clusters bend. VI A Garden trim was placed before the door Kept by diurnal toil in neat array, By walls defended from the insults frore Of Boreas' blast, and Eurus' rude affray; Against whose height leant many a tender spray, Where the ripe fruits in blushing order glow, Matur'd by genial Sol's reflected ray: Nor did their sides unwelcome walk bestow When though the sun be bright, right keen the winds might blow. VII The gravel'd paths by rule exact design'd In equal parts the cultur'd plot divide, Where culinary plants of various kind From every eye the thick espaliers hide, Beneath, the border deck'd with Flora's pride Exhibits to the view unnumber'd dyes, Where in succession through each changing tide Attentive art the varying plants supplies, Still to enchant the smell, and fascinate the eyes. VIII Here venturing on the verge of Winter's power The Snowdrop, Aconite, and Crocus grow, The pallid Primrose hails the vernal hour, And humbly sweet the azure Violets blow, The Lilies of the vale their fragrance throw, In meretricious pride the Tulip blooms, Their gaudy pomp the rich Carnations show, And, o'er the rest who regal power assumes, The Rosier's fragrant bud the passing gale perfumes. IX Nor did Pomona's treasure less abound Alternate as the months their power display; Here crept the fragrant Strawberry on the ground, Or wav'd the Cherry on the loaded spray, Here glow'd the Nectarine in the Summer ray, Here swell'd the Peach all-tempting to the view, Nor was the Gooseberry's meaner fruit away, Or Currant red or rich in golden hue, Or Pear with sugar'd juice, or Plum of glossy blue. X Nor will the Muse disdain with curious eye, Beyond the thick espalier's verdant skreen, Amid the vegetable tribes to pry That spread their shoots the bordering paths between; Salubrious viands for the board I ween!— With various dainties was the ground o'erspread, The Cabbage yellow, and the Colewort green, The Asparagus that springs in lowly bed, And Artichokes that rear aloft the spiny head. XI The Bean whose perfume scents the ambient skies, The twining Pea, the Turnip's juicy root, The Celery that winter's blast defies, The Radish warm, the Carrot's vigorous shoot, The rich Potatoe fam'd Ierne's fruit Sacred to Venus in the genial hour, The Leek whose steams the hasty Cambrian suit, With ample head the swelling Cauliflower, And Lettuce friendly deem'd to Morpheus' drowsy power. XII An Orchard too adjoin'd whose vernal hue Might shame the costly shrubbery's proudest dyes, Whose daisy'd sod delights the roving view, And pasture to the gentle steed supplies; While the bland influence of Autumnal skies Ripen'd the ruddy fruit of general use, Either to crown the board with luscious pies, Or bid the goblet smile with mantling juice, Bright as the generous wines that Southern climes produce. XIII Nor was there wanting ornamental care, The Arbor, seat of Summer jollity, Where Eglantines perfum'd the evening air, And Woodbines sweet, and Jasmins fair to see; Here sometimes from each scene of tumult free Would Contemplation lift her eye divine, And sometimes Mirth excite to social glee, While bright with amber hue the beer would shine, Or blush the crystal cup with Lusitania's wine. XIV Should vagrant Fancy tempt the foot to stray Beyond the Garden's or the Orchard's bound, Through green inclosures led the winding way Which the live fence, and leafy hedge-row mound; While gently gliding through the enamell'd ground A silver stream with placid current flows, Whose shelving bank with vivid alders crown'd A site convenient to the Angler shews While the delusive fly with skilful hand he throws. XV Pleas'd and contented with his calm abode The reverend Pastor liv'd in quiet state, The path heaven mark'd he unrepining trod, Lov'd by the Poor, respected by the Great: The Harpy Envy, and the Fury Hate, Far from his gentle flock he drove away, Till bent at length by Time's increasing weight His failing powers with gradual lapse decay, Secure in happier climes to bloom again for aye. XVI From those fair seats by Isis' sedgy side Where Rhedecyna rears her hundred spires, His holy Successor is soon supplied. His beating bosom swells with new desires; For by the blest attainment he acquires A right from monkish cloisters to remove, Light a pure flame at Wedlock's sacred fires, And all the scenes of untried rapture prove, Which crown the mystic couch of Hymeneal Love. XVII With eager haste he seeks his new abode, Keen Hope anticipating each delight; But o'er the little Empire as he strode It's vulgar Beauties fade upon his sight, For forms of elegance had charm'd his sprite. The alley trim offends his nicer taste, And each compartment rang'd in angles right, Nor can he see by Husbandry debas'd Nature's imperial mien with simple Beauty graced. XVIII Much in his mind he bore each lovely seat That fair Oxonia's neighbouring plains display, How would his raptur'd heart with transports beat Through shady Ditchley's spreading groves to stray, Or as on Nuneham's breezy heights he lay To view the bending stream of Isis flow Through meadows rich in all the pride of May, Or pace the polish'd scenes of princely Stowe, Or fill his sated eye on Blenheim's towery brow. XIX Nor need he wander from the Muses shade To view improving taste's progressive power: No more in knots by skill capricious laid Does tonsile box sage Wickham's arms embower.— Where pious Laud design'd the hallow'd tower Throws Art her vesture with a chaster hand; While, welcome refuge from the sultry hour! By cooling gales with gentle pinions fann'd Merton's delightful groves with gloomy foliage stand. XX Here Ma'dlen too her splendid dome surveys, Or venerable shade, in Cherwell's stream.— O witching Memory assist my lays, And steep my senses in thy soothing dream! Here wandering oft by Cynthia's silver beam My youthful Fancy woo'd the sacred Nine, Or plied by midnight lamp the graver theme, Or joy'd with Mirth's convivial sons to join, Or paid the fervent vow at Friendship's holy shrine. XXI While thus the powers of Elegance unfold Their Faery visions to his dazzled view, With scorn his eyes the homely spot behold;— Anxious the steps of Nature to pursue, On humbler scale his eager thoughts renew Whate'er the sons of genuine taste admire, Whate'er the hands of Brown and Shenstone drew, Or Wheatley's sober diction could inspire, Or wak'd the sounding strings of Mason's heavenly Lyre. XXII Now the strong laborer with repeated blow Each old incumbring ornament assails, The guardian wall, it's sheltering height laid low Admits the Fury of the eastern gales.— Ah! what it's strength the buttress now avails That safely kept the garden's flowery scene!— Spreads the slight fence it's ineffectual rails Painted by curious Art of dusky green, Where oft the sportful lambs, destructive creep between. XXIII The espaliers thick with blushing fruitage gay, The flowing border stretch'd with careful line, The vegetable viands, all give way, And low their heads the orchard-trees recline; While spread abroad with uniform design The unvaried grass-plot dank extends around Chequer'd with ragged clumps of sombre pine, And sinks the deep Haha it's subtle mound, That nothing from the plain the garden scene may bound. XXIV Close by the border winds with tortur'd course The gravel'd path it's undulating way, Where evergreens that mock stern winter's force, And flowering shrubs their different dyes display. The Cypress dark, the Lilac's barren spray, Succeed each useful plant's superior blow, And as the owner's eyes the work survey He sees with joy each fair improvement grow, And deems his little reign a Blenheim or a Stowe. XXV Now issuing from the garden to the fields As Taste capricious bares her active arm, It's leafy shade the lofty Hedgerow yields, And quits the lofty fence it's fragrant charm: Nought can it's vernal sweets the stroke disarm, Low on the earth it's blooming glory lies, Where erst the pathway shelter'd lay and warm, And o'er the scene the scatter'd clumps arise No guard from wintry winds, no shade from sultry skies. XXVI The brook that gently through the level meads As Nature's hand directed us'd to wind, Obedient follows now as Fashion leads In curves is tortur'd, or in lakes confin'd; While to the hands of Industry consign'd No more the bending osiers kiss the tide, Where oft the silent fisher lay reclin'd; And from the force of Sol's meridian pride The Naiad tries in vain her throbbing breast to hide. XXVII The work compleated, now survey the scene Rich in the dress of ornamental Taste, Each useful plant of humbler homelier green By barren elegance is now replaced, While as if seated on the open waste Unshelter'd, uninclos'd the house appears: And by no Arts of Husbandry debas'd, The frequent weed uncheck'd it's offspring rears, And the rude common's garb the scanty paddock wears. XXVIII Wanting the Scythe that each returning dawn Rank Vegetation's progress should correct, Unsightly tufts deform the grassy lawn, Nor can the corded fence the shrubs protect. Oft will the Shepherd Boy his charge neglect And crouding Flocks the rising clumps invade, Oft 'mid the paths by care domestic deck'd The steed's unseemly ordure will be laid, And oft the swine obscene uproot the verdant glade. XXIX And here perchance, bending his beetled brow, Some angry Critic scornful shall exclaim: ‘What Gothic Wight is this, who dares avow ‘To scorn of British Arts the fairest name, ‘Who wishes to recall with Idiot aim ‘What Elegance has banish'd from our shore, ‘Would blast the rural wreath of Albion's fame ‘The ancient forms of Folly to restore, ‘And bid the spruce Parterre usurp her seats once more?’ XXX Far be such blame! no Briton's eye can see With greater joy the rural taste arise, Spread wide in native pomp the untortur'd tree, And the plain turf succeed the tulips dyes, As Nature boon her simple charm supplies Dress'd by the hand of Cultivation fair, Where Art alone the curious eye descries By shining every lawn with neater air, The sod's more glossy green, the gardener's nicer care. XXXI When Grandeur spreads around the extended park Let lavish Nature plan the bold design, The polish'd culture shall the boundary mark, And graced, not cramp'd by Art, the Work shall shine: No need the rule, the level, and the line, Should 'midst the shades intrude with formal mien, The splendid walk, the verdant carpet fine, The contrast bright of variegated green, Shall shew that artful care has form'd the extensive scene. XXXII But when scant Fortune checks this flattering joy, Nor gives to ornament the rural reign, Why the trim Garden's lowlier charms destroy?— Why Husbandry's more homely cares disdain?— If Industry with her assiduous train With step reluctant from the spot recedes, What features shall distinguish Taste's domain From the expanse of pastures, and of meads, But Culture's looser robe, and more luxuriant weeds? SIX OLYMPIC ODES OF PINDAR. BEING THOSE OMITTED BY MR. WEST. TRANSLATED FROM THE GREEK. FIRST PRINTED IN THE YEAR MDCCLXXV. THE FOURTH OLYMPIC ODE. To Psaumis of Camarina, on his Victory in the Chariot Race. ARGUMENT. The Poet, after an invocation to Jupiter, extols Psaumis for his Victory in the Chariot Race, and for his desire to honor his country. From thence he takes occasion to praise him for his skill in managing horses, his hospitality, and his love of peace; and, mentioning the history of Erginus, excuses the early whiteness of his hair. STROPHE. Great Jove! supreme immortal King! Borne on the unwearied thunder's wing; Again thy hours that roll along Responsive to the varied song, Awake my Lyre, and send me forth A witness of heroic worth. The Virtuous in a Friend's success rejoice, And join the applauding Herald's chearful voice.— O son of Saturn! who on Ætna's brow, The woody load of Typhon's giant breast, Holdest thy high abode; the Graces now Invite thee to assist the Strain, address'd To greet the Victor in the Olympic strife; Of every virtuous deed, the lustre, and the life. ANTISTROPHE. On his proud Car triumphant placed, His brows with Pisa's Olive graced, Lo Psaumis comes! the Shores around Fair Camarina's Praise resound; For to his own illustrious name The Patriot joins his Country's Fame. O may the immortal Gods propitious hear His future vows, and grant each pious prayer! Well is he skill'd to train the generous Steed, Fair Plenty crowns his hospitable gate, With breast sincere he courts the placid meed Of smiling Peace, best Guardian of the State. No hues fallacious tinge my honest lay, Experience to the world will every truth display. EPODE. This from the Lemnian Dames' disgrace Freed Erginus. Clymenus' victorious son, When, clad in brazen arms, the race With active limbs the Hero won, And, taking from Hypsipyle the Crown, He thus the royal Maid address'd: Behold the Man! nor great in speed alone! My hand unvanquish'd, undismay'd my breast. These Silver Tresses, lo! are spread Untimely, on a youthful Head; For oft capricious Nature's Rage Gives to the vigorous Brow, the hoary Tint of Age. THE SIXTH OLYMPIC ODE. To Agesias of Syracuse, on his Victory gained by the Apené, or Chariot drawn by Mules. ARGUMENT. The Poet, after comparing the opening of his Ode to the beautiful portico of a palace built by a skilful Architect, celebrates Agesias on account of his Olympic Victory, his being Guardian of the Altar of Jupiter, and being admitted to the rights of a Citizen at Syracuse; and from these circumstances compares him to Amphiaraus. Then he mentions his ancestors; and speaking of Pitana and Evadne, has a long digression on the birth of Iamus. The Poet then returns to Agesias, and declares himself to be in some measure of the same country; and exhorts Æneas, the Leader of the Chorus, to exert himself; directing him to celebrate Agesias, for his being an inhabitant of Sicily, and for his friendship with Hiero, King of Syracuse; and, congratulating him on his good fortune in having two countries, concludes with a Prayer to Neptune for his prosperity. STROPHE I. The skilful Architect whose dædal hand Contrives the far-resplendent dome to raise, Bids the bright porch on shapely columns stand, That rich with gold and polish'd marble, blaze.— So we superbly pour along In conscious dignity the opening Song. To him Olympia's Wreath who wears, Who guards the Thunderer's sacred Fane, And every social blessing shares, With Syracusa's happy train; Each friendly voice shall notes of triumph blow, And each unenvious hand, a votive Wreath bestow. ANTISTROPHE I. In this thrice-honor'd State by fortune placed The happy son of Sostratus behold! Nor is the Warrior, or the Seaman graced Till Danger and till Toil their worth unfold. But Fame's eternal Pæans wait The virtuous labors of the brave and great.— To thee, Agesias, shall belong Those genuine Praises, which of old Adrastus with no flattering tongue On Amphiaraus, sacred Seer! bestow'd: What time the fatal earth with yawning womb, Him and his fiery steeds clos'd living in the tomb. EPODE I. Now seven funeral pyres begun To shed a lurid blaze around, When Adrastus. Talaus' sorrowing son Pour'd to the Theban host this mournful sound: ‘O how I languish to behold ‘The bravest of my warrior train, ‘Who Fate's eternal mysteries can unfold, ‘Or spread destruction o'er the embattled plain! To him, the Syracusan Youth belong Such praise, to whom I tune the Olympic Song. No Son of Discord, I proclaim His Worths, his Triumphs are the same: And with an oath confirm the unerring strain, Form'd by the favoring help of all Aonia's train. STROPHE II. Come then, O Phintis! to the shining Car With speed, with speed, the rapid Coursers join; That whirling o'er the purest paths afar We reach his Ancestor's high-honor'd line. Above the rest my Coursers know When Pisa's Olive decks the Hero's brow, To bear him o'er the sounding road Where, far from dark oblivion's cell, Bright Honor holds her high abode, And Fame and Glory ever dwell. Now wide the Gates of Harmony display, For to Eurota's shores I guide the sounding Lay. ANTISTROPHE II. To fair Pitana sing, who whilom bore Evadne, beauteous in her hair that flows. Compress'd by Neptune on the silent shore, With strictest care she hid her virgin throes; But when the circling moons her pain Maturely brought, she bade her female train, To Æpytus' parental hands With silent care the Child convey; Phasana's turrets who commands, Where Alpheus pours his silver-winding way: On whose enamell'd banks she learn'd to prove, In great Apollo's arms, the blushing Rites of Love. EPODE II. As o'er Heaven's eternal field Roll'd the hours in circling pace, Time to Æpytus reveal'd The produce of the stolen embrace; Now to Pytho's sacred Shrine Eager the anxious Monarch goes, To listening Phœbus and the powers divine The impious deed impatient to disclose. Mean time her zone with purple texture graced Beside the silver urn Evadne placed Veil'd by the bow'ring grove from sight, And gave the heaven-born child to light, While on his birth the Apollo. God with golden hair Invokes the auspicious Fates, and chaste Lucina's care. STROPHE III. Not long, Iamus, on the lonely glade Unnoticed, unprotected, didst thou lie:— For by the Gods command, lo through the shade! Two watchful Dragons dart with azure eye, And from the Bees transparent hoard Thy little breast with dulcet nurture stor'd. And now by rocky Pytho taught The wandering King, return'd again, From all his train domestic sought The fruit of fair Evadne's pain; For shining Phœbus from his sacred Shrine Proclaim'd Evadne's Love, and own'd the Boy divine. ANTISTROPHE III. And openly declar'd his future worth Above mankind in mystic lore should shine, And ne'er be wanting in the happy birth Of glorious sons.—Thus spake the voice divine! Five days were pass'd the mother's pain, Unfound the Infant by the careful train. Far from the reach of every eye, Deep in the irriguous rushes laid, While purple violets growing by, With dewy leaves his body shade: His mother's voice at length the place proclaim'd, And from his fragrant couch the heavenly Infant named. EPODE III. As the gently circling hours Still their fostering influence shed, And opening Manhood's roseate flowers Kindly crown'd his blooming head; Descending then to Alpheus' shores, While round his head the night-winds blow, He calls the God who rules where Ocean roars, And Phœbus dreadful with his silver bow: Desiring public Fame, and fair Renown, Might with their verdant Wreaths his Temples crown.— Soon each paternal voice divine Own'd him as sprung from Heavenly Line; ‘Rise, Son, and this propitious sound pursue, ‘Till Pisa's crowded plains rise to thy raptur'd view.’ STROPHE IV. The Hero straight the voice obey'd; and now Cronius, thy cliffs and rocky heights they scale; There the kind Gods the twofold Art bestow Of Augury, that never knew to fail; There, many a dreadful labor done, At length when great Alcmena's Son Arriv'd, and bade the awful Shrine Sacred to potent Jove arise, And first began those Rites divine, Where Courage wins the Olympic Prize; He rais'd the crouded Fane's prophetic fame, Whilst Grecia's shouting Sons Iamus' Worth proclaim. ANTISTROPHE IV. Hence endless Fame, and happy Fortunes wait On the Iamidæ's exulting race.— Those who in Virtue's rugged ways are great The most conspicuous paths of life shall grace, Still glorious deeds the Hero speak Though Envy burst her venom'd cheek, And teach her offspring to despise The Man, on Pisa's trophied plain Whose Coursers know the Olympic Prize In the twelve-turn'd Course to gain.— Grateful, Agesias! to the powers divine Were all the fervent vows of thy maternal line. EPODE IV. Who beneath the sacred shade Which Cyllene's mountains shed, Honors due for ever paid To Hermes' venerable head; To him who cleaves the yielding skies, The Herald of the ethereal train, Who in the Olympic strife appoints the prize, And guards Arcadia's happy-peopled plain. He and his thundering Sire to thee decreed, O son of Sostratus! the glorious meed.— A sudden thought I raptur'd feel, Which, as the whetstone points the steel, Brightens my sense, and bids me warbling raise To the soft-breathing flute, the kindred notes of praise. STROPHE V. From fair Arcadia too my line I bring, From Stymphalus the bright Metopa came, Mother of warlike Thebes, whose silver spring I drink, and votive songs of triumph frame. Bid your compeers now Æneas raise Their voices to Parthenian Juno's praise; Then shall be known if we avoid The long-borne Adage of Disgrace Which ancient Malice has employ'd To stigmatise Bœotia's race; To thee the secrets of the Muse belong, And well thou know'st to guide the far-resounding song. ANTISTROPHE V. To Syracusa's and Ortygia's praise, Tell them aloud to swell the exulting strain; Whose plains with blameless sceptre Hiero sways, Performing sacred Rites to Ceres' Fane, To her lov'd Daughter, Pluto's Love, And him the King of Gods, Ætnean Jove. Him the sounding Lyre, and Song, Know, and honor as their friend; Ne'er may time that rolls along To his blessings give an end, Still may he, Fortune's friend, with chearful voice In bold Agesias' worth, and votive hymns rejoice. EPODE V. Stymphalus' maternal walls, And Aracadia's fleecy glades Leaving:—here his fortune calls To Sicilia's fragrant shades; Either country claims him now;— When the midnight tempests roar, And raging loud the stormy whirlwinds blow, Two anchors best the shatter'd vessel moor. On each may Heaven it's guardian care bestow!— And thou who rul'st where Ocean's torrents flow, Amphitrite's honor'd mate, Through the rocks and shoals of Fate Propitious guide Agesias' bark along, And grace with livelier flowers my rapture-breathing Song. THE EIGHTH OLYMPIC ODE. To Alcimedon, on his Olympic Victory; Timosthenes, on his Nemean Victory; and Melesias, their Preceptor. ARGUMENT. Though this is called an Olympic Ode, the Poet does not confine himself to Alcimedon, who won the Prize in those Games, but celebrates his Brother Timosthenes, for his success at Nemea, and Melesias, their Instructor. The Ode opens with an invocation to the place where the Games were held. Pindar then, after praising Timosthenes for his early victory in the Nemean Games, mentions Alcimedon, and extols him for his dexterity and strength, his beauty, and his country Ægina; which he celebrates for it's hospitality, and for it's being under the government of the Dorians after the death of Æacus; on whom he has a long digression, giving an account of his assisting the Gods in the building of Troy. Then returning to his subject, he mentions Melesias as skilled himself in the Athletic Exercises, and therefore proper to instruct others; and, enumerating his Triumphs, congratulates him on the success of his Pupil Alcimedon; which, he says, will not only give satisfaction to his living Relations, but will delight the Ghosts of those deceased. The Poet then concludes with a wish for the prosperity of him and his family. STROPHE I. Olympia! Mother of heroic Games! Queen of true Prophecy! beneath whose grove While the red victims pile the aspiring flames, The Augurs search the high behests of Jove: Thence try to know on whom he'll deign to smile Of those, who, by the means of glorious toil, Seek on the dusty cirque with generous pain, Virtue's immortal meed, and honor'd rest to gain. ANTISTROPHE I. For to the supplications of the Good He ever deigns a favoring ear to give, O Pisa's woody shades, o'er Alpheus' flood That wave, my wreath-bestowing Song receive; Eternal Fame, and endless Honors shine, On him whose brows thy sacred Leaves entwine.— For different pleasures, different bosoms glow, And various ways to bliss the indulgent Gods bestow. EPODE I. Timosthenes, what fair renown Was on thy almost infant actions shed, When genial Jove resolv'd with Fame to crown Thine and thy Brother's youthful head! While shouting Nemea owns thy conquering name, And Pisa's groves Alcimedon proclaim: Lovely shone his form, and face; Nor did his deeds that form disgrace, When, Victor in the glorious strife, He bade the listening woods around Ægina's sea-girt shores resound; Whose regions gave him life. STROPHE II. There sacred Themis sits, belov'd of Jove, Her favorite people's ever-watchful guard, The crouded coasts where various nations move To judge with skill, and sway in peace, is hard; By Heaven's decree, amidst the briny flood This isle, to every stranger sacred, stood A column firm.—O ne'er may rolling time, Or black misfortune, change the hospitable clime! ANTISTROPHE II. Here Doria's warlike race their reign begun; Here, after Æacus, their empire rose, Whom potent Neptune, and Latona's son, The friend, and partner of their labor, chose, What time with social care, those heavenly powers Crown'd Ilion's sacred seat with strengthen'd towers: For even then the hostile Fates decreed Her ample Fanes should fall, her hardy Warriors bleed. EPODE II. When the massy work was rais'd, Three azure Dragons on the new-made wall With fury sprung—the people saw amaz'd Two on the ground expiring fall; The third with horrid roars the summit gain'd, When Phœbus thus the fatal sign explain'd: ‘O Æacus, the insulting foe ‘Shall lay the haughty turrets low, ‘Which thou hast rear'd with mortal hands: ‘Ilion, I see thy fate decreed; ‘And in this omen plainly read ‘Immortal Jove's commands. STROPHE III. ‘Nor shall without thy race these bulwarks fall, ‘Thy sons at first shall shake the new-form'd state; ‘The hostile Gods thy grandson's offspring call, ‘To seal it's doom, and close the work of fate.’ Thus spoke the God, and straight o'er Xanthus' tide His skilful hands the heavenly coursers guide, Till midst the warrior race his chariot stood Of Amazonian Dames, by Isther's frozen flood. ANTISTROPHE III. Immortal Neptune's golden horses now To sea-beat Isthmus bear his rapid car: There Æacus on Corinth's lofty brow They leave, spectator of the sportive war.— No bliss alike charms all.—The votive lays Shall envy blast, that chant Melesias' praise? Whose infant sinews, courting fair renown, Add to his other wreaths the fam'd Nemean crown. EPODE III. After, with manly sinews strong, He in the great Pancratium won the prize:— To teach, must surely to the skill'd belong, Experience fools alone despise: Full well the Hero knows above the rest To form with precepts sage the manly breast; To point the surest path that leads To glorious acts, and daring deeds, And future wreaths of fame prepare; And well his Alcimedon. Pupil's fair renown, Who now has won the thirtieth crown, Rewards his Teacher's care. STROPHE IV. By fortune favor'd, nor by manhood less, Four striplings in the strife he overcame, Bade infamy their vanquish'd limbs oppress, And sent them home with foreheads veil'd in shame; While to his Grandsire's hoary head he brings Triumphant joy, whence health, whence vigor springs; For he whom Fortune fans with prosperous breath, Forgets the pains of Age, and near approach of Death. ANTISTROPHE IV. Mnemosyne, awake the silver Lyre, Lo! the Blepsiadæ demand the song: Well their brave brows the flowery bands require, To whom now six Olympic Crowns belong. Nor will the Muse forget the honor'd head Though sunk to earth, and number'd with the dead. The virtuous actions of the Good and Brave, Shall rouze the sleeping dust, and pierce the silent grave. EPODE IV. Iphion 'midst the infernal seats The pleasing news from Hermes' daughter hears; He to Callimachus the tale repeats, Who drinks it with exulting ears, That Jove's supreme behest had deign'd to grace With Pisa's sacred meed their happy race. Still may he good on good bestow, No pallid sickness let them know, Nor Nemesis their social band By cursed Discord e'er disjoin; But happy may they ever shine, To bless their native land! THE NINTH OLYMPIC ODE. To Epharmostus of Opus, on his Olympic and Pythian Victories. ARGUMENT. Pindar begins the Ode with mentioning the Hymn composed by Archilochus, and indiscriminately sung before such of the Olympic Victors as were not fortunate enough to have a Poet to celebrate their particular exploits. He then invokes the Muses, to assist him in praising Epharmostus for his success at Olympia and Pythia, and tells them it requires no common share of genius. He then, speaking of his country, commends him for raising it's honor by his skill and success in Athletic Exercises, and implores the assistance of the Graces; asserting, that no glory can be expected without the aid of the Superior Powers, by whose help, he says, Hercules was able to oppose Neptune, Apollo, and Pluto. Here he checks himself, reflecting, that it is wrong to sing of any thing that may cast dishonor on the Gods; and, describing Deucalion's Flood, addresses Epharmostus and the Citizens of Opus, as being descendants from him and Pyrrha, by means of their daughter Protogenia, who was carried away by Jupiter, and had a son by him named Opus, who founded the city of that name. Him he celebrates for his hospitality, and, enumerating his friends, particularly mentions Menœtius. From thence he digresses to the story of his son Patroclus and Achilles attacking Telephus. The Poet now, invoking again the Muses, desires to commemorate the Victories gained by Epharmostus and his kinsman Lampromachus, and gives an account of their various triumphs; and, asserting the superiority of native over acquired merit, and giving mental accomplishments the preference to all others, he concludes with a compliment to his Hero. STROPHE I. The Lay Archilochus prepar'd, the meed Of every Victor on Olympia's sand, Might have sufficed, thrice chanted, to proceed Brave Epharmostus and his social band; But from her bow let each Aonian maid The glittering shafts of harmony prepare, The heights of sacred Elis to invade, Her shady forests, and her pastures fair; Seats sacred still to thunder-bearing Jove, Which Pelops gain'd, the dower of Hippodamia's love. ANTISTROPHE I. To Pythia too one dulcet arrow send.— Nor does the Poet humble lays require That sings the Chiefs for Glory who contend.— To princely Opus now the silver lyre Awake, and chant her sons athletic worth. Opus, where Themis, with her daughter, reigns, Divine Eunomia.—Mindful of his birth, He decks the capital of Locris' plains With every flower on Alpheus' brink that grows, And every blooming wreath Castalia's cirque bestows. EPODE I. My votive voice, in soothing lays, Shall sing the much-lov'd city's praise; And, swifter than the courser scours the plain, Or the wing'd galley cleaves the yielding main, Will send the Messenger of Fame Through all the admiring world, her honors to proclaim. If haply my assiduous hand Shall cull the flowers that deck the Graces' Land. For every bliss that crowns mankind, Must from the Powers Superior rise; And every plan's by them design'd, That forms the Valiant or the Wise. STROPHE II. Favor'd by them, Alcides' nervous arm Repell'd the Monarch of the briny flood; Nor did the silver bow his heart alarm, But, firmly, angry Phœbus' rage he stood; Nor could stern Pluto's rod his breast dismay, Which drives the dying to his drear abodes:— Rash Muse, desist! nor urge the impious lay; Hateful's the wisdom that blasphemes the Gods.— 'Tis madness, strength absurdly thus to boast, And mortal might compare with Heaven's triumphant Host. ANTISTROPHE II. Let War and Disord, with the ills they bring, Be banish'd distant from the Ethereal Train: Fair Protogenia's new-rais'd city sing, Where, from Parnassus to the level plain, Deucalion and his Mate, descending first, By Jove's command the rising dome design'd; While from the stones their living offspring burst, To fill the nations, and renew mankind.— Let strains like these their pleas'd descendants hear, Old wine delights the taste, new numbers charm the ear. EPODE II. Of old o'er earth's involved head, The congregated waters spread, And o'er the wasted country urg'd their course; Till Jove, relenting, check'd their ruthless force, And bade their native beds again The raging waves absorb, and spare the ravag'd plain. From Pyrrha and Deucalion then Your sires arose, a hardy race of men. Thence your honor'd lineage springs, The offspring of a a God's embrace; And hence, for ever native Kings, With glory reigns the warlike race. STROPHE III. Opus, thy daughter erst Olympic Jove To shady Mænalus from Elis bore; And there compressing with impetuous love, Restor'd her to her plighted Locrus. Lord once more, Her womb then teeming with the heavenly child; Lest fate his days without a son should claim. The Hero on the foster'd Infant smil'd, Pleas'd with his form, and gave his grandsire's name, And subjects brave bestow'd, and fair domains; Whence Opus' lofty walls, and Locris' hardy swains. ANTISTROPHE III. Drawn by his virtues, to whose friendly towers, From Argos, Thebes, and Pisa's fertile plain, And fair Arcadia, croud the social powers, Menoetius, chief among the warrior train He lov'd, from Actor and Ægina sprung: Whose son when wrong'd Atrides call'd to arms, Was nobly found the vengeful train among; Who, when the Greeks from Telephus' alarms Found shameful safety on the friendly flood With Peleus' godlike son, the threatening storm withstood. EPODE III. From hence the skilful well might find The impatience of Patroclus' mind: Achilles, therefore, with parental care, Advis'd him ne'er alone to tempt the war.— O could I soar on daring wings, Where, in her rapid car, the Muse exulting sings; (For ample power, and eager will, Attend with duteous care her footsteps still;) Thy social worth, and Isthmian prize, Lampromachus, should grace my lay. When Fame beheld two trophies rise Congenial, in one rolling day. STROPHE IV. Twice, Epharmostus, too, thy matchless might Fair Corinth saw, twice Nemea's hallow'd ground: Argos thy manly brows with glory dight, And Attica thy youthful forehead crown'd: What praise thou met'st in Marathon's fam'd course! Now, scorning with the beardless youth to run, Match'd with the veteran race, thy rapid force, Temper'd with skill, the silver goblet won; Shout with exulting voice the friendly train, To see the loveliest youth the fairest trophies gain. ANTISTROPHE IV. Lycæan Jove's high feast with wonder glow'd As bold Parrhasia's sons thy form behold; Her prize Pellene on thy strength bestow'd, A guard from warring winds, and wintry cold. Iolaus' tomb, and fair Eleusis' plain Wash'd by the briny wave, thy deeds attest. Though men by labor strive applause to gain, Yet native merit ever shines the best; Nor shall the wreaths attain'd by toil and care, With heaven-descended might, and inborn worth compare. EPODE IV. Not every path extends the same, But various are the roads to Fame; With different eye the same pursuits we view, Nor all one wish with equal zeal pursue; But his great fame shall highest soar, Who climbs the arduous heights of Science' sacred lore. By which inspir'd, I now proclaim My Hero's heaven-born strength, and native Fame; Who, conqueror on Oïlia's plain, Bade the bright wreath of Victory twine, Great Ajax, round thy votive fane, And graced with wreaths the hallow'd shrine. THE TENTH OLYMPIC ODE. To Agesidamus, son of Archestratus, an Epizephyrian Locrian, on his Victory obtained by the Cæstus. ARGUMENT. The Poet begins the Ode by apologising to Agesidamus, for having so long delayed composing it, after promising to do it. He then compliments him upon his country, and consoles him for being worsted at the beginning of the contest, till encouraged by Ilias, by relating the same circumstance of Hercules and Patroclus. He then describes the institution of the Olympic Games, by Hercules, after the victory he obtained over Augeas, and the sons of Neptune and Molione; and enumerates those who won the first Prizes in the Athletic Exercises. He then, returning to Agesidamus, and congratulating him on having a Poet to sing his exploits, though after some delay, concludes with praising him for his strength and beauty. STROPHE I. O Muse, awake the Olympic Lay, Which to Archestratus' brave Son we owe; The meed I promis'd to bestow, Oblivion's icy hand had wip'd away: And thou, O Truth, the favorite Maid Of thundering Jove, vouchsafe thy aid To quell their slanderous falshoods, who pretend I e'er with wilful aim deceiv'd a trusting Friend. ANTISTROPHE I. Full many an hour has roll'd away Since shame has made my cheeks with crimson glow, So long the promis'd meed to owe: But now the song, with interest, I'll repay; And, as where Ocean's billows roar, They clear from stain the pebbled shore, So shall the breath of this my friendly strain, To listening crouds assert my spotless faith again. EPODE I. Where, gently fann'd by Zephyr's balmy breeze, Fair Truth o'er Locris' colony presides; Her Guardian, sweet Calliope, she sees, While warlike Mars the generous care divides.— Bold Cycnus, in the hard-fought field, Forced Hercules at first to yield; Agesidamus, so thy might Was wavering in the Olympic fight, Till, as Achilles' friendly tongue Patroclus' fainting limbs new strung; Brave Ilas' words thy drooping spirits fire, Thy slumbering virtues rouse, and god-like deeds inspire. STROPHE II. When Emulation warms the breast, The Youth (Heaven aiding) matchless Fame shall gain; But few the envied Prize obtain By slothful luxury and lazy rest. Now custom bids my Muse proclaim Jove's Festival and solemn Game, With which Alcides honor'd Pelops' Shrine, When Neptune's baffled sons confess'd his power divine. ANTISTROPHE II. When his triumphant arm had laid, O blameless Cteatus! thy glory low; And bold Eurytas felt the blow, O'ercome by stratagem in Cleon's glade; From proud Augeas to obtain The promis'd meed of toil and pain; And wreak on Molion's sons the fatal day, When stretch'd on Elis' plains his slaughter'd army lay. EPODE II. Soon did the Augeas. faithless King his fraud repay, He saw his country's fairest hopes expire; Saw his exulting cities fall a prey To vengeful slaughter, and consuming fire; Saw desolation's iron reign Extend o'er all his fair domain— Vain are the endeavours to withstand The vengeance of a mightier hand; Awhile he rashly tried to oppose The forceful entry of his shouting foes; Till, seeing fell destruction round him wait, He sought amid the press, a voluntary fate. STROPHE III. On Pisa's plains the son of Jove Assembled, with their spoils, his conquering band; And bade for ever sacred stand To his eternal Sire this hallow'd grove: Bade sacred fences straight surround The Altis' consecrated ground; Whilst round, the festive seats with splendor gleam, And crown the verdant brink of Alpheus' honored stream. ANTISTROPHE III. Alpheus, who, with the imperial train Of high Olympus, shares the sacrifice; Where the Saturnian summits rise, With site conspicuous from the trophied plain:— There, erst when Oenomaus sway'd, In snow was wrapp'd the unnoticed glade. On the first rites propitious smil'd the Fates; And Time, on whom even Truth for confirmation waits: EPODE III. He, rolling on with never-ceasing course, To the succeeding race of men declares, How the rich spoils of war's resistless force, The godlike Hero 'midst his army shares; And bids the festive games still chear Again each fifth revolving year.— Who in the contests, now ordain'd, The first Olympic wreath obtain'd? Whose coursers in the rattling car, Or limbs exerted in the sportive war, Or feet inur'd to urge the rapid race, Snatch'd from their baffled foes the matchless olive's grace? STROPHE IV. On the long Stadium's even course, Oeonus, great Licymnius' valiant son, The Prize with active footsteps won, Who brought from Midia's plains his friendly force: Resplendent with the wrestler's oil, Fair Victory crown'd the Echemus. Tegean's toil: While brave Doryclus, from Tirynthe's shore, The Cæstus' manly prize from all his rivals bore. ANTISTROPHE IV. Conspicuous on his conquering car, The Muse Mantinian Semus' Coursers sings; Phrastor the unerring javelin flings; While, by Eniceus' sinews hurl'd, afar Beyond the rest the Discus flies.— Resound the shores with friendly cries; While lovely Luna pours her argent light Full-orb'd, and chears with rays the gloomy shades of night. EPODE IV. The echoing woods, and vaulted temples round, Ring with the jocund shouts, and festive strain. Following their great example, we resound Their glories who the Olympic Olive gain: And in the far-resounding verse The manly Victor's praise rehearse, And tune the Hymn to awful Jove; Who, 'mid the sapphire plains above, Bids the bright-gleaming lightning fly, And darts the thunder thro' the trembling sky. Breath'd to soft flutes sweet sounds the lingering lay, Which, form'd on Dirce's brink, though long deferr'd, we pay. STROPHE V. As grateful comes the long-hop'd air; As to the expecting sire whom age and pain To second childhood bend again, The happy offspring of a legal heir: The joyful tidings straight impart New vigor to his sinking heart; For wealth itself the dying breast offends, When to a stranger's hand the envied gift descends. ANTISTROPHE V. So he who at dread Pluto's gate Arrives unsung;—though worth and fair renown His every word and action crown, What shining honor shall that worth await? Thy ears, the lyre, and dulcet flute, Agesidamus! shall salute; O'er thy fair fame distil mellifluous lays, And all Pieria's Choir afford thee ample praise. EPODE V. And on his country too we must bestow The faithful tribute of a votive verse; On Locris' race the honied stream shall flow, While their victorious son my lays rehearse; Whom, by Olympia's awful shrine, My eyes beheld, with strength divine, In the stern conflict bear away The envied trohpies of the day. Lovely his form, while youth's soft grace Shed smiling beauty o'er his face; Youth's bloom divine, which, join'd to potent Love, The ruthless arm of Death from Ganymedes drove. THE THIRTEENTH OLYMPIC ODE. To Xenophon of Corinth, on his Victory in the Stadic Course, and Pentathlon, at Olympia. ARGUMENT. The Poet begins his Ode, by complimenting the family of Xenophon, on their successes in the Olympic Games, and their hospitality; and then celebrates their country, Corinth, for it's good government, and for the quick genius of it's inhabitants, in the invention of many useful and ornamental Arts. He then implores Jupiter to continue his blessings on them, and to remain propitious to Xenophon; whose exploits he enumerates, together with those of Thessalus and Ptœodorus, his father and grandfather. He then launches out again in praise of Corinth and her Citizens, and relates the story of Bellerophon. He then, checking himself for digressing so far, returns to his Hero, relates his various success in the inferior Games of Greece, and concludes with a Prayer to Jupiter. STROPHE I. Whilst I rehearse the illustrious House's Praise, Thrice Victor in Olympia's sportive war, To friends and strangers open; let my lays The fame of happy Corinth bear afar: Which as a gate to Neptune's Isthmus stands, Proud of her blooming youth and manly bands; There, fair Eunomia, with her sister train Blest Peace and Justice, hold their steady reign; Who wealth and smiling ease on mortals shower, From Themis' genial care drawing their natal hour. ANTISTROPHE I. But bloated insolence and fell disdain Far from their peaceful seats they drive away. Now lovely deeds inspire my sounding strain, And honest boldness swells my rising lay; When native worth the generous bosoms feel, 'Tis hard the shining virtues to conceal. Corinth, on thee the blooming hours bestow The envied wreaths from manly deeds that flow, And teach thy dædal sons with careful heart, First to explore the way of many a useful art. EPODE I. Who bade the bullock sacred bleed To Bacchus in the Dithyrambic Rite? Who first with reins the generous steed Directed in his rapid flight? And bade the sculptur'd bird of Jove The temple's massy roofs above, For ever fix'd on either end, His ornamental wings extend? While the sweet Muse her silver sounds inspires, And Mars with glorious flame the warriors bosom fires. STROPHE II. Olympia's honor'd Patron! potent Jove! Whose sovereign mandates o'er the world extend, O with propitious ear my strain approve, And, to fair Corinth's virtuous sons a friend, On Xenophon let gales propitious breathe, And take with hand benign the victor wreath He won: surpassing, when on Pisa's shore, What mortal valor had perform'd before; The Stadic Course re-echo'd his renown, And with knit limbs he gain'd the Pentathletic Crown. ANTISTROPHE II. And twice conspicuous on the trophied Course The Isthmian Parsley graced his Victor brow; Nor Nemea's Cirque contemn'd the Hero's Force.— And where the sacred waves of Alpheus flow His father Thessalus the Olive wore By swiftness gain'd, and since on Pythia's shore, One sun beheld his might, 'mid wondering eyes Obtain the Stadic, and Diaulic Prize; And the same month, to grace his lovely brow, The third triumphal Wreath did Attica bestow. EPODE II. Seven times Hellotia crown'd his force, And since on Isthmus sea-encircled plain, Victors in Neptune's sacred course, He and his Sire the Prize obtain. The swelling joy, the sounding song, Still follow as they go along; What wreaths! what honors! too, they bore From Pythia's, and from Nemea's shore!— He who recounts their various crowns, as well May number all the sands where ocean's billows swell. STROPHE III. Some medium though will every praise beseem,— Which 'tis the first of wisdom still to know.— While, with no alien voice, the much-lov'd theme The fame of Corinth from my lips shall flow; And I her Chiefs, and prudent Sires rehearse, No sounds fallacious shall disgrace my verse: There Sisyphus arose, whose wiles could shine With matchless force and lustre near divine; Medea there, whom Venus' flames inspire The Grecian ship to save, and cheat her cruel sire. ANTISTROPHE III. When warr'd the Greeks on Phrygia's hostile strand, On either side her sons embattled stood, Though to bear Helen from the ill-fated land; Her warriors with the Atridæ cross'd the flood; Yet some, who those with vengeful spears repell'd From Corinth's race their honor'd lineage held, For Lycian Glaucus to the Achaian host Trembling before his lance, would often boast His sire's abode, and wealth, and wide domain, Where fair Pirene's waves enrich the fertile plain. EPODE III. Who by the silver fountain's side Much labor found, and much affliction knew, While winged Pegasus he tried Medusa's offspring to subdue; Till, sleeping on his native plains, Minerva gave the golden reins; ‘Awake, Æolian King! awake! ‘This sacred gift with transport take; ‘Shew it to Neptune, potent God of steeds, ‘While at his hallow'd Shrine the votive bullock bleeds.’ STROPHE IV. The Ægis-bearing Maid Minerva spoke, While midnight slumbers clos'd his heavy eyes; Straight from the dull embrace of sleep he broke, And seiz'd with eager hand the glittering prize: Cæranus' son he sought, the neighbouring Seer, And pour'd the wond'rous tidings in his ear; That, as in awful Pallas' holy Fane, Sleep o'er his temples spread her leaden reign, Before him stood confess'd the warlike Maid, And by his side at once the golden bridle laid. ANTISTROPHE IV. The wondering Augur bade him straight obey Each mystic mandate of the dream divine; To Neptune first the votive bullock pay, Then to equestrian Pallas rear a shrine: Beyond his hopes the Gods with savoring will The object of his wishes soon fulfil; For brave Bellerophon, with joyful look, The sacred present of the Immortals took; Threw it with ease about his arching head, And peaceful in his hand the ethereal courser led. EPODE IV. Now, shining in refulgent arms, The winged Pegasus his limbs bestrode; And, seeking war's severe alarms, To Amazonia's plains he rode; And, 'midst the chilling reign of frost, O'ercame the Female Archer-Host. His arms Chimæra's flames subdue; The dauntless Solymi he slew.— I pass the death his cruel fate decreed, When Jove's eternal stalls receiv'd the immortal Steed. STROPHE V. While thus the shafts of harmony I throw, Let me not aim too wide with erring hand; The Muses now command the strain to flow To Olygæthidæ's triumphant band; Recount the early praise and young renown, On Isthmus' and on Nemea's Cirque they won; In verse concise stupendous deeds display, And with an oath confirm the wonderous lay; On either course alike their skill was fam'd, For sixty Victor Wreaths the Herald's voice proclaim'd. ANTISTROPHE V. How oft their brows the Olympic Olive graced, To Fame already have my numbers given; What future crowns shall on their heads be placed, Though we may hope, is only known to Heaven: Yet if new strifes their genius bids them prove, We trust the event to Mars, and mighty Jove. Oft from Parnassus' heights the meed they bore And Argos' fields, and Thebes' resounding shore; And in Lycæan Jove's imperial Fane Recorded stand their toils on fair Arcadia's plain. EPODE V. Pellene's fields, and Sycion's coast; Megara, and the Æacides' domain; Eleusis's cirque, and, Freedom's boast, Fair Marathon's triumphant plain; Proud Ætna, and Eubœa green, Have their victorious trophies seen. Through Grecia's realms their large amount Of wreaths, in vain the Muse would count.— Assist, immortal Jove! my soaring lays, And crown with honor'd ease my calm-revolving days. TWO FRAGMENTS OF PINDAR's THRENI, PRESERVED BY PLUTARCH. ON THE SITUATION OF THE BLEST. While sable night o'er mortal' heads Her gloomy mantle silent spreads, On them with undiminish'd blaze Pours shining Sol his splendid rays. When issuing from the polish'd dome To tread the fragrant meads they roam, Charming the eye, on every side The rose displays it's purple pride; Each bough with golden fruitage bends, Each flower a heavenly perfume sends. There some restrain the courser's fire, Some wake the soul-delighting lyre, While rapturous bliss, and thrilling joy, At once their every sense employ. Thick from the shining altars round Which frequent grace the hallow'd ground, The rolling clouds of incense rise, And waft their odors to the skies. ON THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL. 'Tis friendly Death alone bestows A refuge sure from human woes. What though our mortal frames await The inevitable stroke of Fate, Given by the Gods, the immortal Mind Unhurt, shall life eternal find: Though oft when toil subdues the breast Awhile she sink to silent rest, Yet when in balmy sleep we lie Around her active senses sly, And clearly-boding dreams impart Her judgment to the slumbering heart, Which Bliss, fair Virtue's meed declare, For Vice, the pangs of sad Despair. A GREEK SCOLION, OR SONG, By CALLISTRATUS, On HARMODIUS and ARISTOGEITON Harmodius and Aristogeiton, who are celebrated in this Scolion, slew Hipparchus the Tyrant of Athens, in the Panathenæan Festival; concealing their swords in the branches of myrtle that were carried on that occasion. This Song was in such request, as to be constantly sung at every Entertainment during the Athenian Republic; insomuch, that the saying, such a Person had never sung Harmodius with one, was equivalent to saying he never had eaten at one's house. The present Bishop of London, in his Prelections on the Sacred Poesy of the Hebrews, partly imputes the effectual expulsion of the Pisistratidæ to the popularity of this Song. The last instance the Athenians gave of their Democratical Spirit, was the erecting the Statues of Brutus and Cassius, by those of Harmodius and Aristogeiton.. In myrtle wreaths my sword I bear, As, fir'd by zeal, the illustrious pair Conceal'd from view the avenging sword The haughty Tyrant's breast that gor'd, And Athen's equal rights restor'd. Belov'd Harmodius! Death in vain O'er thee usurp'd a transient reign. Those happy Isles thy footsteps tread Where amaranthine flowers are shed On Peleus' Son, and Diomed. In myrtle wreaths my sword I bear, As, fir'd by zeal, the illustrious pair Their patriot weapons veil'd from sight, When in Minerva's solemn rite Hipparchus sunk to endless night. Eternal glory's deathless meed Shall, lov'd Harmodius, crown thy deed, And brave Aristogeiton's sword, Because the Tyrant's breast ye gor'd, And Athens' equal rights restor'd.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. FARINGDON HILL. A POEM. IN TWO BOOKS. FIRST PRINTED IN THE YEAR 1774. FIES NOBILIUM TU QUOQUE MONTIUM. Faringdon Hill, so called from the neighbouring town, is an eminence rising easily from the vale of White Horse; the whole of which it commands, as well as an extensive prospect over part of Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Glocestershire, and Wiltshire. It has a small grove on the top, which is a noted land-mark, being seen at a great distance every way. BOOK I. Now with meridian force the orb of day Pours on our throbbing heads his sultry ray; O'er the wide concave of the blue serene No fleecy cloud or vapory mist is seen; The panting flocks and herds, at ease reclin'd, Catch the faint eddies of the flitting wind; To silence hush'd is every rural sound; And noontide spreads a solemn stillness round: Alike our languid limbs would now forsake The open meadow, and the tangled brake; Here Sol intensely glows, and there the trees Mix their thick foliage, and exclude the breeze.— Come let us quit these scenes, and climb yon brow, Yon airy summit where the Zephyrs blow; While waving o'er our heads the welcome shade, Shuts out the sunbeams from the upland glade: No steep ascent we scale with feverish toil, No rocks alarm us, and no mountains foil; But as we gently tread the rising green, Large, and more large extends the spacious scene; Till on the verdant top our labour crown'd, The wide Horizon is our only bound. What various objects scatter'd round us lie, And charm on every side the curious eye!— Amidst such ample stores, how shall the Muse Know where to turn her sight, and which to choose?— Here lofty mountains lift their azure heads; There it's green lap the grassy meadow spreads; Enclosures here the sylvan scene divide; There plains extended spread their harvests wide; Here oaks, their mossy limbs wide stretching, meet And form impervious thickets at our feet; Through aromatic heaps of ripening hay, There silver Isis wins her winding way; And many a tower, and many a spire between, Shoots from the groves, and cheers the rural scene. Still as I look, fresh objects seem to rise; And lovelier pictures strike my raptur'd eyes, As young remembrance paints each sylvan glade, Where full of glee my careless childhood stray'd. Though other hills perhaps as large a field To warm description's fairy powers may yield, As rich a prospect to the sight display, O'er meads as verdant, and o'er plains as gay; Yet, when in Memory's fond mirror shewn, The country smiles with beauties not it's own; Her fair reflection new delight supplies, And every floweret blooms with deeper dyes; The landscape seems to brighten while I gaze, And Phoebus shines with more than summer rays; O'er the high woods a livelier verdure reigns, And more luxuriant harvests deck the plains; Even when fell winter spreads his mantle drear, And big with snow descends the inclement year, Let but her glass reflect the dismal view, The wither'd trees their wonted charms renew; The feather'd tribes resume their chearing lay, And spring her odors, and his beams the day; December yields to April's milder power, And vernal blossoms grace the wintry hour. O sacred Nature! Nymph divinely bright! Unfold thy various prospects to my sight; With thee o'er breezy uplands let me rove, Or tread the devious labyrinth of the grove; When from the east the glorious orb of day Shoots o'er the burnish'd cliff his golden ray, When splendid in meridian light array'd, His piercing beams the woodland gloom pervade; When wrap'd in misty evening's sober reign The increasing darkness steals across the plain; When o'er the dusky stole of silent night The Delian Goddess throws her silver light; When gently o'er the flower-empurpled vale The vernal Zephyrs breathe a genial gale; When, as fierce Summer's sultry beams descend, With blushing fruit the loaded branches bend; When Autumn crowns the hills with waving corn, And pours profusion from his twisted horn; While deepening shade on shade the woods are seen, From the full crimson to the faded green; Or when, it's leafy honors swept away, The scatter'd forest yields to winter's sway; When the cascade, by icy fetters tied, Must cease to murmur, and the stream to glide; While blows the storm, or falls the chilling rain, Or fleecy snows o'erspread the whiten'd plain; In every hour and season let me trace, Enchanting Nature! thy transcendant grace; With eager eyes thy lovely form survey, And bless with grateful voice thy boundless sway. Happy the youth! on whose high honor'd head The sacred Nine their fostering influence shed, Though they refuse the lasting wreath, whose bloom Shall grace his living brow, and deck his tomb; For the fresh laurel give a sickly flower, Boast of a day, and glory of an hour; Yet taught by them his ravish'd eyes explore The choicest objects of thy charming store: For him their strains the sylvan warblers breathe, For him fair Maia twines her flowery wreath; Fragrant for him the morning breezes blow, The poplar trembles, and the fountains flow; Thy various beauties strike his raptur'd breast, And Nature doubly charms by Fancy dress'd. Enough has Fancy, frantic with delight, O'er the gay region stretch'd her vagrant flight; Let sage Experience now of brow severe Arrest her soaring in her bold career: Nor thou, historic Truth, thy aid refuse, But join the labors of the rural Muse; With friendly care the pleasing toil divide, That while she paints the blooming landscape's pride, Thy voice each storied relick may explain, And tell the former fortunes of the plain. First to the north direct your roving eyes, Where fair Oxonia's verdant hills arise; There Burford's downs invite the healthful chace, Or urge the emulous coursers to the race; While as with agile limbs the ascent they scale, Rush down the steep, or sweep across the vale, Exulting Hope, by turns, and chilling Fear In the pale cheek and eager eye appear; Each generous fire in every heart is lost, By fortune favor'd, or by fortune cross'd; Flies every Virtue, withers every Grace, And all the selfish Passions take their place. Emerging from the thicket's bosom, there See Bamptom's pointed steeple rise in air: To farther distance now the prospect drawn, Lo Witney's spire diversifies the lawn! Whose busy loom to balmy sleep supplies A guard from wintry cold and freezing skies: There Whichwood's oaks thick-waving o'er the glade Yield to the salvage tribe an ample shade: And in the horizon faintly ting'd with blue Thy woods, imperial Blenheim! close the view, Nature between one verdant carpet spreads Of fruitful pastures and enamel'd meads; Whose bending reeds, and osier'd banks among, Fair Isis rolls her virgin waves along; Her horn while Plenty pours on every side, And Pales revels where her waters glide. Hail, lovely Isis! dear parental stream! The pride of Commerce, and the Poet's theme: Though, vain of borrow'd pomp, imperious Thame, Deck'd with the praise which ought to wait thy name, Triumphant pours his swelling waves along, Hail'd by the bard, and dignified in song; Thy silver urn the affluent tide bestows, And from thy source the plenteous current flows: Such is the fate that female honors find, When to a mate unequal fondly join'd. O had thy stream! like Arethuse of old, It's virgin waters unpolluted roll'd, Old Thame through humble vales had pass'd alone, Sung by no bard, unnoticed, and unknown; While thine had been confess'd the unrival'd pride, To waft in commerce with each rising tide, With foreign spoils Augusta's walls to greet, And lay the nations tribute at her feet: Thine been the boast to flow, with current clear, Through Runy-mead, near Staines, where Magna Charta was signed. meads to British Freedom ever dear, Where the bold Barons in a happy hour Wrested her charter from a tyrant's power; While grateful bards contended to rehearse Thy virgin glories in no vulgar verse: For long as Windsor rais'd her sylvan shade Or Cooper's swelling hill o'erlook'd the glade, Sacred to fame thy stream had flow'd along, In Pope's soft lays, or Denham's sounding song. Then as thy lucid current gently stray'd Through fair Etona's academic shade; While by thy side his silver Lyre he strung, Gray to thy wave his dulcet notes had sung: And many a bard in Granta's vale who strays, And tunes to hoary Cam his votive lays, Whose youthful Fancy and Invention new Cull'd the fresh flowers that on thy borders grew, Had join'd to celebrate thy classic fame, And half his tribute paid to Isis' name. And lo! where heathy Cumner-hurst, a hill near Oxford. Cumner's envious height Hides all thy letter'd triumph from my sight! Where 'midst fair Rhedicina's gothic towers, Her hallow'd cloisters, and Pierian bowers, Isis her silver urn inclines, and views The votive wreath of every grateful Muse. No rivulet there from thee their tribute draws, Usurps thy fame, or shares their just applause: But gentle Cherwell hears with joy their lays, And loves the strain that chants a sister's praise; Pleas'd if the Muse, to grace her head, bestows One roseate flower that on thy Margin blows. Nor shall thy reeds in future times complain Of slighted worth and Thame's usurp'd domain; That his too favor'd stream with princely waves The crowded walls of proud Augusta laves; The votive verse that Pope and Denham raise, And breathe to him the swelling note of praise; For him that Gray the strain unequal'd frames, And sings the moral ode to hoary Thames; Since fair Oxonia's polish'd sons unite To vindicate thy classic current's right; Since every Muse to thee consigns her lays, And every Science on thy border strays; And every Grace, and every Art, whose powers In symmetry have rais'd her dædal towers, To listening crowds thy parent worth proclaim, And found their pride on thy maternal name. Ere yet such scenes of pomp thy channel knows, While humbly here thy lingering water flows; While yet thy virgin waves obscurely glide, Sung by no Muse, nor boast a classic tide; Say wilt thou here incline thy urn, to heed The inglorious warbling of my Doric reed? Though here no city spread her various stores, No costly villas crown thy peopled shores; Yet every charm of Peace's rural reign Attends thy progress through each smiling plain. The flocks and herds here crowd thy rushy brink, Graze on thy sides or from thy bosom drink; And every herb, and every flower that blows On the green margin where thy current flows; If a luxuriant bloom they justly boast, Beyond the produce of another coast; As in thy glassy wave their charms they see, Shall own they owe each vivid tint to thee. There was a battle fought in Richard the second's time, at Radcot-bridge just below Faringdon.Yet glittering spears have here been whilom seen, And purple war has stain'd thy osiers green; Here hostile swords have shed a horrid gleam, And floating corses chok'd thy frighted stream; While Civil Discord drove with hideous roar The trembling Naiads from thy widow'd shore. Ah! ne'er may arms again thy seats invade, Or shouts of war disturb thy hallow'd shade; But heaven-born Peace with Plenty in her train Fix on thy sedgy banks her halcyon reign. The manor and hundred of Faringdon were granted by King John to the abby of Beaulieu in the New Forest, Hants.Here too, more fell than war's destructive race, Has Superstition shewn her gorgon face: Here where thy chearing stream with gentle waves These fertile meads and verdant pastures laves, Where now unwearied Industry resides, And Toil exulting tills thy fruitful sides; For Liberty protects the happy swains, And Property secures what labor gains; Erst the rich soil, though cultur'd, useless lay, To monkish ease and luxury a prey, While distant abbeys with thy wealth were stor'd, The British subjects of an alien lord. When bigot John, despotic power to gain, Found open force and treacherous cunning vain; His daring nobles fir'd by virtuous pride His arts eluded, and his force defied; With Rome's anathemas he arm'd his hand, And papal thunders shook the trembling land; Thirsting for lawless sway, he stoop'd to own His crown dependant on a foreign throne; To foreign lords ignoble homage gave, To reign at home a tyrant and a slave. 'Twas then the ravenous monks, a sordid crew, O'er all the wasted land like locusts flew; Each rich demesne that to the crown remain'd, By right, by forfeiture, or conquest gain'd, Was given to gratify the Church's pride, And bribe the holy cohorts to his side. Even 'mid those scenes of devastation wild, Where William's power the fertile district spoil'd, The gazing pilgrim saw with strange surprize Aspiring structures 'midst the desert rise; And where no trace of man's abode was seen, No noise disturb'd the tenants of the green, Save the seas breaking o'er the sounding shore, Or the faint dashing of the distant oar; There haughty Beaulieu's gothic arches bend, And high in air her glittering spires ascend; While the wild forest's hairy sons around Start at the unusual anthem's swelling sound. These fruitful plains, in that unhappy hour Of papal sway and sacerdotal power, Were doom'd the new-rais'd abbey to maintain, And distant Beaulieu rul'd the fair domain. The famish'd swain beheld with mournful eye The verdant meadows round him useless lie; While pamper'd ignorance and priestly pride The rich productions of the land divide; Till Henry's haughty soul the bondage broke, Redeem'd the nation from the servile yoke, And suffer'd active Industry once more To dwell, fair Isis! by thy happy shore: Hence as these blooming fields, (thus heaven decreed,) A tyrant shackled, so a tyrant freed. Yet now, as thro' the abbey's mouldering dome The Muses oft with wandering footsteps roam, And, while with silver radiance Luna's beam Shoots through the lengthening isles a trembling gleam, As pensive Meditation points the way, By ruin'd piles and nodding towers they stray: See o'er the impending arch the ivy spread, And gothic pillars threat the passer's head, Struck with the awful scene, the astonish'd train Bewail the fall of Superstition's reign. Hence many a bard has o'er the ruins hung, And mourn'd the devastation as he sung; Has Error's fate in plaintive verse deplor'd, And wept the day that Reason's rights restor'd. As bending upward near her scanty source We backward trace the river's narrowing course, Her pointed spire see A market-town in Glocestershire lying on the Isis. Lechlade proudly rears! And lowly Cricklade on her banks appears; Cricklade is a town in Wiltshire, from which the navigation of the Isis begins; said to have been originally called Greeklade, from the Greek language being first taught there in England. Cricklade, where first, when Grecia's letter'd train, By Slavery exil'd from their native plain, To fair Hesperia's vales their science bore, To Gallia's fields, and Albion's distant shore; Those strains Ilissus' stream was wont to hear Were pour'd, O Isis, on thy raptur'd ear: While Grecia's Muse, around whose matron brow Had twin'd the Athenian olive's fruitful bough, Forc'd by the rage of Mahomet's savage host To quit with lingering step Byzantium's coast; Her drooping forehead with thy osiers bound, And on thy brink a new Lyceum found; Till woo'd by princely gifts, these peaceful bowers She left for Granta's and Oxonia's towers. And here thy waves, by learning now unknown, To busy Commerce sacred flow alone, Where first the loaded raft, and cumberous barge, Trust to thy placid breast their weighty charge. Ah, Isis! can the Muse forget that hand, Whose wanton cruelty thy ruin plann'd? Or not forgetting, from resentment free, Recall the hours that threaten'd fate to thee?— When vain Alluding to the scheme of cutting a canal instead of continuing the navigation of the river. projectors doom'd thy stream to flow Through meads, neglected, lingering, sad, and slow; Till the o'er-loaded wave should scarcely force Through gathering sand, and sedge, it's laboring course; While in thy stead their plastic power should guide The stagnate lake by wintry rains supplied. Perish such schemes! nor by their use be lost The noblest river, Britain's Isle can boast!— Let channels, form'd by art, be ever led Where no fair current wears a native bed; Then through the obstructing hill, and o'er the vale, Like Egerton conduct the swelling sail: Even Isis shall applaud, if from her source, To where Sabrina pours her amber course, They bid the smooth canal it's length display, And feed with copious springs the tedious way: Till the fraught barge the extended line explores From Bristol's crowded wharf to London's princely shores. More westward when we cast our wandering eyes, Level as ocean's bed the champaign lies: While, like some promontory's rugged brow, Proud A high hill, between Faringdon and Coleshill, where there are remains of an encampment. Badbury's height o'erlooks the plain below, Where, in yon Saxon camp, the mill its sails Spreads to the wind, and courts the rising gales. Beneath how open lies the spacious scene! No lofty mountains envious intervene; But o'er the extended lawns our fancies stray, Till lost in hazy mists they fade away; By faint degrees the distant prospect dies, And the blue landscape melts into the skies. Where gently Cole's pellucid waters glide, Here Fairford is a town in Glostershire, famous for the glass in the church windows, painted by Albert Durer. Fairford rears her tower with conscious pride; Whose windows, with historic painting dight, Attract the curious traveller's wondering sight: And there, conspicuous 'mid the lawny glade, Fair Cirencester spreads her ample shade. Hail happy seat! whose twilight glooms among Full many a bard has rais'd the tuneful song. Grows not an oak his hundred arms who spreads O'er the gay verdure of thy fruitful meads; Sighs not a grotto to thy murmuring gales, Nor flows a fountain through thy winding vales, But seems a classic influence to diffuse, To Science dear, and haunted by the Muse: Who oft as morning pours her misty ray, Or fades the glimmering beam of parting day, Explores each nodding grove, and every plain, Sacred to her and all her favorite train. These scenes could Addison's chaste notes inspire; Here Pope harmonious struck his silver lyre; Caught 'midst these solemn shades the glorious plan, “To vindicate the ways of God to man.” Arbuthnot here, and Swift, with useful art, Rear'd Satire's dreaded scourge, or steel'd her dart: Here Prior the Graces form'd thy softer lay And taught the moral strain to blameless Gay; Each pleas'd the Master's praises to engage, The famed Mæcenas of that happier age. After such bards, O Bathurst, wilt thou deign To mark the notes of my inglorious strain? Shall I presume in these degenerate days To form one humble verse to Bathurst's praise? Yes, thou wilt deign my artless notes to hear, Wilt to my strain inglorious bend thine ear; And as thy patronage, with noontide ray, Bade to full vigor shoot the verdant bay, Taught it the storms of Envy to deride, And spread it's waving boughs with summer pride; So thy declining beam with milder power Shall shed it's influence on the autumnal flower. O blest old man! on thy thrice happy head Her choicest gifts has smiling Fortune shed; Has been for once from taste capricious free, And true to virtue's cause in favoring thee. As Anna's hand around thy youthful brow Thy country's fairest honors taught to grow; So now, while Justice bids exulting Fame Tell to succeeding times her Apsley's name, Marking the source from whence his merit flows, A fresher wreath thy grateful Prince bestows. Meantime, disarm'd of all his hostile rage, Lenient on thee descends the weight of Age; While still thy soul preserves her wonted power, To charm the letter'd or the social hour: No sharp Disease attends his gentle reign, Nor palsied Indolence nor wasting Pain, But healthful through the woods thy footsteps stray, Where thy own oaks their gloomy shade display: For to thy lot of all mankind is given That joy peculiar by indulgent heaven, To see, while round the barbarous hand of taste Deforms the grove, and lays the forest waste, O'er each uncultur'd hill, and barren glade, Thy rising thickets spread unusual shade, And, in their full luxuriance dress'd, display Their waving foliage to the face of day. May thy example Britain's lords inspire! O may they catch from thee the patriot fire! Then shall the Dryads, and their sprightly train, Rove o'er the extent of many a barren plain: O'er the bleak waste, where dreary heath and skies Fatigue the sight, the forest then should rise; Again on Windsor's heights the woods be seen, And all her sable hills be cloth'd with green; Her russet mountains send their oaks once more To waft destruction to some hostile shore. What tho' Britannia's plains manur'd with care Refuse the plants of every soil to bear; What though no olive grow among her vales, No citron groves perfume her balmy gales; Though India's spicy forests are denied, Nor spreads Judea's palm her leafy pride; Yet her thick woods unnumber'd trees produce, Sacred at once to ornament and use. With verdant beech her towering hills are spread, And Scotia's pine erects her gloomy head; The shapely fir, that graced Olympus' The fir that Tournefort says grows in such abundance on Mount Olympus, is what we call the silver fir, which agrees remarkably well with this climate, and will bear the most exposed situations; as will also that beautiful evergreen the Cedar of Libanus. brow, Deigns o'er her heights to wave her silver bough; And, holy Lebanon, thy cedars rise, Hang o'er her cliffs, nor dread her northern skies; The elm, and pliant ash, a vigorous train, Deck with resplendent green the smiling plain; The bending willow o'er the marshy glade And shining poplar shed a trembling shade; And many a hardy plant is wafted o'er, To grace her forests from the Atlantic shore, Whose branches, rising from the kindred soil, Mix with her trees, and pay the planter's toil. Here too, matur'd by many rolling years, Above the rest her native oak appears; Whose giant limbs extend her noblest boast, Pride of her groves, and bulwark of her coast. Sure when the Druid train with awful rite In pious orgies past the dreary night; While, as their steps the hallow'd trunk surround, The mystic misletoe their foreheads bound; They meant to teach their sons succeeding race, To venerate the groves that deck'd the place. O ever on Britannia's grateful breast, Unhurt by time, this image be impress'd! Still may her heart that sacred tree adore, Which drives Invasion from her peaceful shore: So shall each storm of war, whose fatal sway Speeds o'er her neighbouring realms it's bloody way, Break like the baffled storm against her coast, It's force unheeded, and it's fury lost; As her own oak defies the headlong course Of warring winds, and mocks the tempest's force. Nor does fair Albion view with envious eye The ripe productions of a southern sky. Let the rich vineyard spread it's purple stores O'er Gallia's coasts, and Lusitania's shores; Where with hard hands the tawny peasants press The swelling grape, a foreign board to bless: Though 'neath our rougher heaven the docile vine Around the lofty elm refuse to twine, Yet has Pomona with no niggard hand Her blushing orchards scatter'd o'er the land; Whose ruddy fruits a generous stream produce Strong as the cluster'd grape's inspiring juice. Our humble vales the hop's green tendrils grace, Clasping their stays in many a close embrace; These to the bearded barley's harvest join'd, By skill concocted, and with care refin'd, A liquor yield, that Britain's sons draw forth Mantling, and bright, the vintage of the north! Which crowns the humble and the haughty board, And chears alike the Peasant and the Lord; Regales o'erwearied Labor at his toil, And teaches fainting Industry to smile. The thankful swain beholds the goblet shine, Nor envies other lands their rosy wine, Where slavish hinds with skilful hands prepare The luscious beverage, which they must not share. Refresh'd with this, Britannia's sons sustain The keenest labors of the toilsome plain; Nor, when the hours of work are past, employ The vacant eve in gay luxurious joy, Trill the loose air, or beat the echoing ground To the soft flute, or tabor's sprightly sound; But with knit limbs on rougher pastime bent, They strain their sinews to their full extent; Direct the quoit, or hurl the massy bar, Or wage with brawny arms the sportive war. In other realms, to humble swains unknown, While Honor fires Nobility alone, Our meanest Peasants share the generous flame, And learn to glow at Freedom's hallow'd name; Hence have they, led by Glory's call afar, With hosts unnumber'd wag'd the unequal war; Hence Cressy's field, Poitier's victorious fray; Hence glorious Agincourt, thy wonderous day! Hence Europe sav'd near Danube's distant flood; And Blenheim's ramparts red with Gallic blood! And hence those manly deeds renew'd again On Abraham's heights, and Minden's trophied plain. O ne'er may fell Corruption's tainting force Poison of all our pride this happy source! To false Refinement with destructive pains Polish the manly roughness of our swains! Exil'd from other realms, while here alone Fair Liberty erects her holy throne, The exulting train, her glorious gifts who share, Will scorn of foreign crowds the suppliant air: Who sees our clowns obsequious, sees the day That gives our Glory and our Rights away. In vain would laws guard Freedom's sacred shrine, If Freedom's sons their native worth resign; In vain shall Fraud attempt, or Force alarm, While Valor steels the breast, and Labor nerves the arm. BOOK II. The sultry hours are past, and Phœbus now Spreads yellower rays along the mountain's brow: The broken clouds unnumber'd tints display, Drinking the effulgence of departing day; And to our eyes present a radiant view, Italia's purpled ether never knew. The eastern prospect now attracts the sight Where every shrub reflects the setting light: With ruddy flash the cottage casement gleams, And shines the waving wood with golden beams. Where Isis stream divides yon distant glade, Lo The seat of Earl Harcourt. Nuneham rises 'midst the sombre shade; While at her feet, as the clear current bends, The lofty spire of Abingdon ascends. Hygeia and her Oread train inhale On The seat of Sir William Stonhouse, Bart. Radley's site the pure ethereal gale. On An encampment, said to be Danish, between Abingdon and Faringdon. Cherbury's ramparts, urg'd by peaceful toil, The shining plowshare turns the fruitful soil, Where erst the peasant saw with anxious fear The gleaming falchion and protended spear. On The seat of the Rev. Mr. John Loder. Hinton's verdant brow the lofty trees Tremble obedient to the evening breeze: And The seat of Mrs. Allen. Pusey her inverted dome surveys, In the smooth stream that through her meadows strays. See The seat of Sir Robert Throckmorton, Bart. Buckland here her lovely scenes display, Which rude e'er while in rich disorder lay, Till Taste and Genius with corrective hand Spread culture's nicest vesture o'er the land, Rang'd every object in it's fairest light, And call'd each latent beauty to the sight; Cloth'd the declining slope with pendant wood, And o'er the sedge-grown meadow pour'd the flood, While manly Execution's active arm Wakes to existence each ideal charm. In the deep gloom of yon impervious bowers, There The seat of Edward Southby, Esq. Carswell hides her hospitable towers: And at our feet where the rich pastures spread, Lo The seat of Charles Pye, Esq. Wadley rears her renovated head, As art and active labor, join'd, improve Each fair extended lawn and rising grove, New scenes unfolding still on every side Declare the affluence industry supply'd. Blush! blush, ye sons of power! who proudly stand Rich in the ruins of your native land; Who every virtue, every right have sold, For royal smiles, or ministerial gold; Proud on your breasts a glittering badge to bear, True honor hates, and freedom scorns to wear, If worth, or shewn in peace, or prov'd in war, Shed not a livelier lustre than the star? Blush, ye fell race! who cross'd the briny flood, Foes to mankind! and prodigal of blood! With wanton rage to waft pale famine o'er From Albion's cliffs to sad Bengala's shore: Where starving myriads on the cruel train Call'd Justice' awful sword, but call'd in vain; Till Britain's senate, fir'd with patriot flame, Resolv'd to vindicate her country's fame, Bade England's laws to Ganges' banks extend, And equal rule the Indian's life defend. Though Grecia's orders grace your marble dome, Though blooms the fairest landscape where ye roam, Yet sacred Justice shall your seats pervade, And Conscience haunt you through the deepest shade: Whilst him whose wealth the arts of Commerce raise, Mankind shall honor, and the Muse shall praise. But if like thine, O Charles! his generous heart, The smiles of fortune to his friends impart; If heaven, that gave him affluence, gave him too A soul to every social duty true; Virtue with joy shall chant his favor'd name, And give a wreath beyond the power of fame; While all who know his worth exulting find That fortune, blessing him, has blest mankind. Lo A seat of Lord Spencer's. Shellingford, an A village between Wantage and Faringdon. Stanford, 'midst the train Of hoary trees that skirt yon level plain, The lofty tower and pointed spire display Conspicuous, glittering in the western ray: And on yon hill it's distant head that rears, The seat of Charles Wymondefold, Esq; where there is a most beautiful Grotto, entirely formed by the taste, and in great measure by the hands of Mrs. Wymondefold. Lockinge aloft thy shining dome appears! Beneath, what woodland nymph with artful hand The vaulted grotto's sparry roof has plann'd, Taught the rude arch with pendant ore to shine, And rang'd each bright production of the mine? No sylvan Goddess this retreat can claim, Form'd by the fancy of a mortal dame; Who from yon humble vale's irriguous bed To the high cliff the crystal fountain led; Thence bade in murmurs soft the lucid wave Pour it's fair current through the craggy cave; Where every Naiad 'midst the rocks reclin'd, Approves what Taste and Wymondesold design'd. Ye envious trees! why does your leafy pride, Stretch'd o'er the bending valley, Wantage hide?— Sure every Muse and every Grace will join With votive hands the fairest wreath to twine; Cull with assiduous toil the choicest flowers, And hang the brightest garland on her towers: While grateful Liberty shall love the shade, Her guardian chief where fostering Virtue laid; And Britain's Genius bless the hallow'd earth Which gave her patriot king, her Alfred, birth. That equal laws these happy regions share Springs, Prince benign! from thy paternal care. Through the dark mists which Error o'er mankind Tenfold had spread, and wrap'd the human mind; At thy command fair Science shot her light, And chas'd the horrid gloom of Gothic night; To Isis' brink the wandering Muses led, And taught each drooping art to lift her head: Hence with the warrior laurel's blood-stain'd bough That binds with sacred wreath thy conquering brow, Wisdom's illustrious Goddess interweaves With mystic hand her olive's peaceful leaves. Thine is the gift that here no alien crew, To venal interest more than justice true, Judge with unpitying eye misfortune's cause, With cruel power enforcing cruel laws; But watchful Themis o'er each freeman rears That sacred shield, the judgment of his peers, By which protected Britain's dauntless train See factions rage, and tyrants frown, in vain. O dear-bought Freedom! if thy holy flame Burns in our souls, nor rests an empty name; If for thy sake the kindling warmth we feel Unwarp'd by selfish views or party zeal; May we with wakeful, nay with jealous, eye Regard this hallow'd source of Liberty; This once attack'd, on which her rights depend, May every breast the guardian power defend; Each patriot tongue assert our injur'd laws, And pour resistless sounds in Freedom's cause; Each patriot arm, should eloquence be vain, Lift the dread falchion on the embattled plain; May we with more than ancient zeal pursue Rights, Rome and boasted Athens never knew; Guard this Palladium with our latest breath, Or perish with it in a glorious death! Where from the fertile plains yon hills arise, Quit the low vales and shoot into the skies, Carv'd rudely on the pendant sod, is seen The White Horse-hill, so called from the figure of a horse in chalk, on the side of a hill; from which also the adjacent vale takes it's name: it is said to have been cut in commemoration of a victory gained over the Danes, by Alfred. snow-white courser stretching o'er the green: The antique figure scan with curious eye, The glorious monument of victory! There England rear'd her long dejected head, There Alfred triumph'd, and invasion bled. Long had proud Denmark stretch'd the iron hand Of harsh oppression o'er the groaning land; The freeborn swains, to mean subjection broke, In silent sorrow bore the opprobrious yoke: Their virtuous prince to wilds and forests driven, No shed to screen him from the inclement heaven, Hears all around his subjects cries ascend, And sees them sink unable to defend; Chas'd by his foes disguis'd he treads the plain, A wretched exile in his own domain! Much hardship borne, and many dangers past, On suffering Virtue Fortune smiles at last: Arous'd to vengeance by his people's woe He frowns defiance on the insulting foe; Leaves every fear and every doubt behind.— High waves the Saxon banner to the wind! Fir'd at the sight, the country far and wide Pours forth her veteran sons on every side; His trusty bow each hardy yeoman draws, Or lifts his shining brand in Freedom's cause: Freedom resounds from each determin'd voice, Freedom the first, and death the second, choice; Courage and Conquest o'er their helmets play; The invader trembled at the dread array; Onward resistless march'd the impetuous host; And fell Oppression fled the hostile coast: The exulting steed in conquering standards flies, While Denmark's raven screaming quits the skies; And hence the Victor's jocund hands portray'd The Saxon ensign on yon verdant glade. His country freed, discerning Alfred saw How vain the civil bond of social law; Of crowds untrain'd how weak the hasty aid, When force prevails, and barbarous hosts invade. That policy which guards each modern throne Was then to Europe's bounded kings unknown; No artful statesman then with treacherous breast Arm'd half a people to enslave the rest. With wiser care a rampart firm he plann'd, To guard from future foes the happy land, Bade Liberty her rash assailants brave, And Freemen vindicate what Freedom gave. He taught each sturdy laborer of the field The sickle and the sword by turns to wield: With chearful industry the generous swains Till for their wealthy lords the peaceful plains; Or, rous'd from rural toil by war's alarms, Beneath their well-known banners rush to arms. Let other realms where Freedom never smil'd, O'eraw'd by rigor, or by fraud beguil'd, See mercenary bands surround the throne, Or safety seek from alien arms alone: But shall not England blush for every son Too proud to guard the rights his sires have won? Rights, in whose cause full many a warrior stood, By toil obtain'd, and seal'd with patriot blood! Though envy frown, though venal millions blame, Shall she not ever love her Chatham's name, Who while on distant climes her rage he pour'd, Prudent at home this best defence restor'd; Her manly sons array'd with parent care, Arous'd once more her manly youth to war, And bade her breezy hills, and fruitful plains, Send forth in arms again their native swains. Lives there a man in this exulting isle, Who sees our orchards bloom, our harvests smile, Who every breath in perfect freedom draws, His rights protected by the noblest laws; Would wish to break the fence by wisdom plann'd, And wrest the sword from every freeman's hand, Wish to behold our bare defenceless coasts Unarm'd, or guarded but by foreign hosts? Dare thy strong powers O Eloquence employ! This best internal bulwark to destroy?— Though every guile of specious Fraud he use, 'Mid listening crowds his Poison to infuse; Try every Wile his curs'd Designs to hide:— Superior Truth his Cunning shall deride, Shall tear each paltry mean Disguise away, Expose his Rancor to the face of day; His selfish Views to all mankind impart, And shew the Traitor graven on his heart. Now turn your eyes and from the mountain's brow Direct them to the cultur'd vale below; How rich the spacious plains that stretch between! How ripe the harvests, and the meads how green! The herds in myriads o'er the pastures throng; And mingled lowings break each rural song. Where e'er with patient care the laborer's hand Guides the sharp plow-share through the fertile land, The farmers see the produce crown their toil, Eye the rich scene, and bless the happy soil. Soon shall the yellow wealth whose swelling grains The stalk low bending hardly now sustains, Stor'd in the barn with jocund labor, yield To every rural sport the uncumber'd field. The pointer then shall o'er the stubbled vale Range unconfin'd, and catch the tainted gale: The hound's quick scent, or greyhound's eager view, O'er the smooth plain the timid hare pursue; Then swelling on the burthen'd breeze afar, Shall burst the tumult of the woodland war; While rush the daring youth with breathless speed To see the wily fox unpity'd bleed. Let not the Muse the active toil despise, Or from the chace avert her angry eyes: Though gentle That drowns the sacred lyre. Shenstone deem'd the hunter's throat Drown'd with it's clamorous strain the lyric note: Though pensive Thomson, indolently laid Beneath the silver willows trembling shade, Baiting with cruel art the treacherous hook, To lure the guiltless inmates of the brook, Blame, as his hands the barbed weapon draw From the mute wretches agonizing jaw, Those, who in manly sport with frantic joy The rapid tenants of the wood destroy: Yet has the warbling lyre in many a strain Describ'd the active pleasures of the plain. The moral bard of Windsor's royal groves Sings of the hunter, and his toil approves; Even he, whose verse to mortal eyes has given The wrath of angels, and the wars of heaven, Chearly rouse the slumbering morn.Joyful has listen'd to the hounds, and horn, Rousing with chearful peal the slumbering morn: Nor shall with brow averse the rural Muse To Somerville the Poet's meed refuse, Whose skilful notes each sylvan pastime trace, And teach the various mazes of the chace; Whence livelier thoughts and lighter spirits rise, Strength knits the limbs and courage fires the eyes, Glows in the ruddy cheek a purer blood, And rolls the tide of life a sprightlier flood. Propitious now on Britain's favor'd isle Though white-rob'd Peace and jocund Plenty smile; Though while her wrath on hostile shores is hurl'd, Unhurt she sits amidst a warring world; Say, have the tranquil scenes which now we see Been ever such, and must they ever be? Ah! may not Civil Discord stalk again With bloody footsteps o'er her ravag'd plain? Or fell invasion waste her fenceless coast, Her guardian Fleet by adverse tempests toss'd? Then, if our country's bleeding breast demands The aid of dauntless breasts, and ready hands, To the stout race who haunt the hill and dale Will nothing then the hunter's toil avail?— While round her feeble votary's drooping brow What verdant wreaths shall letter'd sloth bestow? In vain may Patriot Zeal the bosom warm, If pale disease unnerve the willing arm: While the bold youth whose hardy frame defies The force of fighting winds and angry skies; Who braving winter's rage pursues the chace, The sleety tempest rattling in his face; Or when the dog-star shoots his sultry rays, Rages unconquer'd by the scorching blaze; Shall, if he lead Britannia's rustic train, To the dread conflict of some bloody plain, Shrink not, though summer suns their beams unfold, Or biting frosts intensely pierce with cold, But Freedom's call with stedfast march pursue Through noontide's sultry heat, or midnight's chilling dew. Too much the enervate bards of modern days Attune to slothful ease their moral lays; The seats of ancient lore their favorite theme, Lyceum's shade, and hoary Academe; Forgetful that the stadium's hardy toil, The boxer's cæstus, and the wrestler's oil, Sent Grecia's heroes forth a vigorous train, Learn'd in the schools and victors on the plain. The Socrates. Athenian sage, his Country's pride and shame, Is known to martial, as to letter'd, fame; Now did he sooth with truth's divine behest, Young Alcibiades, thy fervent breast, Now through the paths of war thy steps he led, And Plutarch mentions the circumstance of Alcibiades being wounded at Potidæa, and rescued by Socrates. rear'd his guardian buckler o'er thy head, And Xenophon. he, whose mind with active virtue fraught, Practis'd each lesson that his master taught, Not satisfied of love divine to dream, By the still margin of Ilissus' stream, Or in warm Fancy's vivid tints to draw Ideal forms of Polity and Law; The illustrious Chief who led his glorious band O'er barren rocks, and deserts black with sand, Still undismay'd amid surrounding woes, Still scattering terror on unnumber'd foes. Learn'd 'midst the echoing forests to sustain The toils of war and all her horrid train; Then taught, descending to the embattled field, Barbarian rage and Persian wiles to yield. Let Luxury's vain sons with careless pride The votaries firm of manly toil deride, Wrap'd in inglorious sloth, let them despise The noble thirst of glorious enterprise. But shall the Muse, whose hand should point the road Which leads o'er rugged steeps to fame's abode; Whose voice should loudly chant each Hero's name, To wake in other minds a kindred flame?— Shall she inglorious now in siren lays Lavish on harmless Indolence her praise; Damp the strong flame that warms the noble breast, And hush each generous passion into rest? Shall she to those alone confine the song, Who creep obscure life's tranquil vale along, And blame the dauntless few who dare explore The dangerous rocks of bold Ambition's shore; Who tempt with venturous prow life's stormy seas, And toil themselves to buy for others ease; Unaw'd by tyrant power, or factious hate, Who tread with blameless feet the paths of state; Or pluck bight honor's sacred meed afar, Undaunted, from the frowning front of war? Well may with pious hand the indignant Muse To many a Victor's brow the wreath refuse, Well may she tear the laurel vainly spread O'er many a King's and many a Warrior's head; And curse a Cæsar's or a Cromwell's name, Though erring myriads call their ravage fame. But shall not they who conquer, or who die, In the great strife of injur'd Liberty, A tribute from the peaceful bard expect, Sung by those Muses whom their swords protect? Say cannot Greece and Rome their warriors bring, To whom even Virtue's hand might strike the string? Say cannot Albion, 'mongst whose sons we find All that exalts and dignifies mankind; Say cannot she afford such themes of praise As well might grace the poet's chastest lays? She can!—she can!—Her Alfred planning laws, Her Godlike Hambden bleeding in their cause; Guiding with uncorrupted hands the state Her Walsingham in scorn of fortune great; Her gallant Wolfe triumphant even in death, While weeping Victory caught his parting breath; Her Hawke, whose ardor rocks nor shoals could bar, Nor the dread rage of elemental war, While his bold fleet the Gaul's design explores, Destroys his navy, and insults his shores; Are themes whose force the coldest bard may fire, To call forth rapture from his sounding lyre, While Truth shall listen to the warbling strings, And Reason vindicate what Fancy sings. Enough, rash Muse! tempt not the arduous height Which asks the Epic or Pindaric flight: To the fair vale again reduce the lay, Ere envious twilight snatch the scene away; For evening's shades with deepening tint prevail, And darkness soon shall wrap the misty dale. Here The seat of the Earl of Radnor, built by Inigo Jones. Coleshill's towers demand their share of fame, Proud of their site, and their great Artist's name; There, shelter'd from the storm by bowering trees, The milder charms of verdant The seat of Lord Barrington. Becket please. What though her level lawn nor sinks, nor swells, Forms rising hills, or hollow-winding dells; Yet every friend to genuine taste, who roves Or by her shining lakes or through her groves, Shall see a Grace in every solemn shade, And own that Beauty crowns each watery glade. Let Taste capricious strive to charm the heart With all the nice perplexities of art, With toil immense a sickly scene produce Trifling in ornament as void of use, Bid Britain's hills Arabia's sweets perfume, Bid in our vales Sabæan roses bloom, Bid summer's fruits 'mid winter's frosts appear, Force stubborn Nature and invert the year. To blend utility with each design The nobler praise, O Barrington! be thine; The smooth canal whose ample sheet supplies Food for the board, and pleasure to the eyes, O'er the morass in shining volumes laid Drains the moist surface of the rushy glade, And where the marsh and frequent slough impede The shatter'd carriage, and the floundering steed, There the firm causeys form'd by useful care O'er the deep vale the thankful traveller bear. Contract the prospect now, and mark more near Fair Faringdon her humble turret rear, Faringdon-house had a royal garrison in the civil wars, and was one of the last places that held out for the king; repulsing with great loss a large party of the Parliament forces, just before the surrender of Oxford. Sir Robert Pye, owner of the house, who married Anne the eldest daughter of Hambden, and was a Colonel in the Parliament army, commanded this attack, in which the spire of Faringdon Church was beaten down by the artillery.Where once the tapering spire conspicuous grew, Till civil strife the sacred pile o'erthrew: For as on hapless Stuart's ruin bent, Against yon walls their lord his thunder sent, And led with ruthless rage the hostile train, While his own weeping Lares plead in vain; The balls invade, with erring fury driven, The hallow'd structure consecrate to heaven. Such is alas the baleful fruit that springs From factious subjects and oppressive kings! Beneath yon roof by the cold pavement press'd, My peaceful sires in solemn silence rest.— Imagination flags her pinions here, And o'er the marble drops the filial tear; Here too the Muse prepares the votive verse, The mournful tribute to a Parent's herse;— O sacred Name! by every tie endear'd! Lov'd by your friends, by all who knew rever'd. How well you bore, to Freedom ever just, This fertile County's delegated Trust, The British Senate saw, when firm you stood, Firm to fair Virtue, and your Country's good; Friend to the worth from Patriot Zeal that springs, No dupe to Faction, and no Slave to Kings. How far your private merits could extend, How kind a Father, and how warm a Friend, My faultering voice would strive to sing in vain, For gushing tears would choke the imperfect strain; The force of words unequal to impart The strong sensations of my heaving heart. Here ever slumbering with the silent dead, Thy daughter, glorious Hambden! rests her head. Ah cruel mother! say, why does not here Thy youthful Mr. Hambden Pye, eldest son of Sir Robert Pye, who marrying contrary to the wishes of his parents, went abroad, and was killed in an expedition against the coast of Spain, or Spanish America. Hambden press his early bier? Why does no storied urn his worth proclaim, Who shar'd his grandsire's virtues with his name?— Untimely on a distant shore he died, The wretched victim of a parent's pride. Ye mourning Loves and Graces, aid the verse, While I in plaintive notes his woes rehearse; To these his native fields his wrongs relate, The hapless story of a Lover's fate. His youthful form could boast each manly grace, Health strung his nerves, and beauty deck'd his face; Ingenuous shame, and truth that scorns disguise, Glow in his cheek, and sparkle in his eyes: But ah! when manhood now with genial ray Began to call his virtues into day, Love! all controling Love! whose fatal power Spares the rank weed to crop the blushing flower, Nip'd all his ripening graces in their bloom, And early mark'd his merits for the tomb. An aged swain, whose lowly cottage stood Where 'midst the valley spreads yon rising wood, A lovely daughter had, whose matchless form The frozen heart of sapless age might warm: With falling snow her polish'd skin could vie, Her lips the coral sham'd, the jet her eye: There love and modesty united speak, And opening roses paint her glowing cheek; The soft redundance of her hair behind Flow'd loose, and careless wanton'd in the wind; Such powerful charms the youthful Hambden fire, He saw perfection, and he felt desire: The growing passion every thought employs, Disturbs his peace, and poisons all his joys. Maria's image ever in his breast His daily ease destroys and nightly rest; From his wan cheek the lively crimson flies, And smiling health forsakes his sinking eyes: No more his well-breath'd hounds, at early dawn Ranging, dash eager o'er the dewy lawn; Now sad he wanders through the sylvan glades, And sighs responsive to the lonesome shades, Each Echo answers to his mournful tale, And pensive numbers float on every gale. But, as increasing Love resistless grew, From his torn bosom vanquish'd Prudence flew; To fair Maria's feet he sighing came, Confess'd her empire and avow'd his flame; Soon his soft words the beauteous virgin move, And secret Hymen crown'd his eager love. Now peace and happiness appear to spread Their flattering pinions o'er his favor'd head; Love every joy and every charm supplies, And marks each golden moment as it flies. Ah hapless pair! the short-liv'd bliss enjoy, Soon shall impending clouds your calm destroy; Even now, with more than mortal vengeance red, The tempest bursts on each devoted head. Ten quick-revolving moons had roll'd away, And smiling transport crown'd each happy day; When various symptoms to the world disclose Maria soon must feel a mother's throes: The busy neighbours round the tale proclaim, And scowling Envy triumphs in her shame. At length the generous youth, distress'd to hear Each clownish tongue her reputation tear, Throws with indignant scorn the veil aside, And owns the fair Maria for his bride. Soon as his cruel mother heard the tale, Swift grows her cheek with trembling anger pale; In vain his youth, in vain her beauties plead, Instant revenge pursues the imprudent deed; No worth could please to peasants when allied, No charms disarm the force of female pride.— Say did thy Father such distinctions find, Amidst the equal race of human kind, When his keen sword he drew in Freedom's cause, And bled to vindicate her trampled laws? While rage and hate the ruthless matron fire, She bears the fatal tidings to his sire, Tries every art a father's wrath to move, Awake his vengeance, and subdue his love. With savage cruelty they now divide The hapless Hambden from his weeping bride: She rends her hair, and beats her breast in vain, Torn from her arms he seeks the distant main. It chanc'd that Britain's hardy sons prepare To pour on haughty Spain their naval war.— Brief let me be, the winds propitious blew, Proud o'er the waves the gallant navy flew; Britain aloft her bloody ensign spread, Iberia saw, she trembled, and she fled; While her resistless foes exulting bore The spoils of India to their native shore.— Ah gallant youth! nor native shore, nor friend, Shall e'er to thee their welcome sight extend; Far on a hostile coast thy body lies, Wash'd by rude waves, or scorch'd by sultry skies. When sad Maria heard the tale of woe, From her full eyes no gushing torrents flow; No current gives her burthen'd breast relief, But pale she sullen sits in silent grief; Till her heart bursting with redoubled sighs, She calls her much lov'd Hambden's name, and dies. The haughty parents, then alas too late! Mourn their unhappy son's disastrous fate; Grieve for the woes their fatal rage supply'd, Tear their gray locks, and curse their foolish pride; Pour tears of anguish o'er Maria's grave, And weep the victims they refus'd to save. Turn from these solemn scenes the averted head, The awful mansions of the silent dead! To where the green-rob'd Dryads joyful rove 'Midst the thick foliage of yon echoing grove.— Ah blissful seats! beneath whose pleasing shade My Childhood and my Youth delighted stray'd; Here first my eyes beheld the gems that shine Bright and resplendent from the classic mine; While as I gaz'd my youthful bosom glow'd, And from my tongue untutor'd numbers flow'd. Here far from every selfish passion's reach, Which the world's dangerous school will often teach, I pour'd to real Love one artless tear, And breath'd at Friendship's shrine the vow sincere. The Muses here their grateful offerings pay, And dedicate to you their closing lay; Nor ask a brighter wreath to grace their song, Than verdant grows these waving woods among. Blest, happy Regions! seats of joy and ease! Which still have pleas'd me, and must ever please; Should e'er a Tyrant's Sway, or Faction's Roar, Drive Liberty from this her native shore; Though following her, I'd rather friendless go Through Afric's burning wastes, or Zembla's snow, Than haunt these much-lov'd shades and favorite springs, Robb'd of the joys that independence brings: Yet should I wander to a fairer plain Than thought can paint, or youthful fancy feign; Still should I load with sighs the reckless wind, Still weep those darling scenes I left behind. If this be weakness! from my beating heart O never!—never! may that weakness part!— Let the proud Stoic with disdainful eyes The thought of local prejudice despise, And boast in every soil and every air Where Virtue florishes, his country there; But ask the generous train whose bosoms beat With gentle feelings, as with patriot heat; Would not to see each long-frequented shade Low on the earth by hostile vengeance laid, On Albion's desolated fields to gaze, See her towers fall, her splendid cities blaze; Though every friend had left the ruin'd coast, And weeping Freedom mourn'd her empire lost, Still with new rage their kindling breasts inspire, And bid their bosoms glow with fiercer fire. But far from us such sad events shall be, If aught the Muse prophetic can foresee; Still Peace and heavenly Liberty shall smile, With wonted sweetness on their long-lov'd isle; Pale Tyranny avoid the hostile shore, And Faction lift her scorpion scourge no more; Each freeborn swain still reap with thankful hand, Secure from wrongs, the produce of his land: And lovely Faringdon! my voice shall still Or in thy groves, or on this healthful hill, In rustic numbers sing the happy plains, Where Freedom triumphs, and where Brunswick reigns.

As when the stream by casual fountains fed First gushes from the cavern's mossy bed, Dashing from rock to rock, the scanty rill With no luxuriant herbage clothes the hill; Yet when increas'd the ampler current flows, Each bordering mead with deeper verdure glows, It's lingering waves through painted vallies glide, And Health and Plenty deck it's verdant side; Till swell'd by wintry storms and sweeping rains, If chance it's rising deluge drown the plains, The stagnate waters choke the sedgy soil, And the fond hopes of future harvests foil: So first Refinement in it's infant hour Sheds o'er the savage tribe an useless power, Nor can it's feeble energy impart Or grace or softness to the human heart; But when in Reason's moderate bounds confin'd It's plenteous streams invigorate the mind, The rising Arts their genial influence share, And all the social Virtues flourish there; Till Luxury's polluting torrents roll A flood destructive o'er the enervate soul, And to the flowers of generous growth succeeds The baneful progeny of Vice's weeds. Man, ere by rules of civil compact taught, (Uncouth his form, and unimprov'd his thought,) O'er the rude waste a selfish savage goes, Nor mutual cares, nor mutual kindness knows, How to subsist his Being's sole employ, Strength all his art, and rapine all his joy; And where a steril soil, and frowning heaven, Are to his race by ruthless Nature given, Compell'd by chace his scanty food to gain, Pierc'd by sharp winds, or drench'd by chilling rain, While from the assailing climate, rigid grown, The alter'd fibres lose each nicer tone, Long is the torpid soul by want oppress'd, And dawning Reason slowly lights the breast. But when his milder, happier portion, lies In kindly regions, and more genial skies, Where balmy sweets the ambient gales dispense, And native Luxury enchants the sense, Where Earth disdaining cultivation's care Bids her free sons the luscious banquet share, And the thick groves a roof sufficient spread To shield from dews and heat the slumbering head; Press'd by no want, in leisure's vacant hours The expanding Mind perceives her latent powers, And from the silken air the nerves derive, To each sensation tremblingly alive, Pleasures uncheck'd by labor's stern control, And bear each finer feeling to the soul. Then as reclining on the fertile soil, Unknown the want of culture's stubborn toil, His grazing charge the gentle herdsman tends, And o'er the vale his eye delighted bends, Ten thousand lovely images suggest The dreams of Fancy to his tranquil breast, The female form his soften'd heart inspires With milder thoughts and more refin'd desires, Sweet notes of rural courtship fill the grove, And flow the tender strains of pastoral love: Or as his eyes the nightly ether view, And trace the heavenly concave's cloudless blue, He learns to know what different signs appear To guide and regulate the varied year; Observes the changeful Moon alternate show Her orb full-beaming, and her waning bow, And marks the inferior Planets as they roll In stated periods round the shining pole. Hence every charm that polish'd Nature knows, All that eludes or weakens human woes First dawn'd in regions where the solar beam Pours with superior force the effulgent stream, And to our view the infant Arts arise Beneath the warmth of Asia's fostering skies, Or on Arabia's happier coasts inhale, Loaded with sweets, the aromatic gale, Or with attentive ear the fables learn Of mystic lore, by Nile's redundant urn; Till gently wafted by the favoring breeze O'er the smooth surface of Ionian seas, The smiling train their lovely offspring bore To rise and flourish on the Grecian shore. Inventive Fancy emulous to raise For Worth deceas'd the monument of praise, To bid Fame live beyond this transient breath, And snatch heroic deeds from icy death, With filial love the frail memorial rear'd, And the heap'd fragment mark'd the tomb rever'd: But vain the pious care!—Oblivion's sway Soon swept each undistinguish'd name away, The story of renown no breast retains, And unexplain'd the mouldering pile remains. Then ripening Genius sought the Muses aid, And rustic Verse it's opening powers display'd; Though no soft grace of polish'd diction shine, Though harsh the cadence, and though rude the line, Yet strengthen'd Memory felt the useful art That fix'd the favorite legend in the heart; The hoary Sage the sure advantage saw, And in rough strains promulg'd his simple law, In the short verse the moral rule compress'd, And early form'd to truth the docile breast. The infant warblings of the Muses lyre Subdue the will perverse, and passion dire; Their gloomy wilds the savage race forsook As Orpheus sung, and milder manners took, And charm'd to order by Amphion's lay The forms of civil life mankind obey. As bursts the beam of day through clouded skies At length with light ethereal Letters rise, To chain the fleeting sound their magic taught, Portray'd the Idea, and embodied thought; Blest, happiest, privilege to mortals given! Which wings the aspiring soul from Earth to Heaven. Whether progressive skill the art acquir'd, Or power divine the sacred gift inspir'd; Whether a mere invention of the Mind As opening Science civiliz'd mankind, Or a peculiar mark of heavenly grace At first bestow'd on Israel's favor'd race Though Reason doubt;—from morn to setting day The various tribes of human-kind survey, And own that all who following Wisdom's plan Fulfil those duties that distinguish Man; All who extend their penetrating sight Beyond the reach of animal delight, This blessing from one common fountain share, Though ting'd with ignorance, or refin'd by care: Even Greece where letter'd Science prosper'd best It's oriental origin confess'd, Fix'd by the fabled Author Asia's claim, And mark'd it's source by Cadmus is derived from a word in the oriental languages, signifying the East. Cadmus' mystic name. As the ripe feed when sown with skilful toil Soon feels the influence of a friendly soil, With rapid shoots the planter's care repays, And high in air it's waving boughs displays; So Greece beheld the ingenuous Arts expand In her congenial air, and kindly land, While Freedom by the insulting despot driven From Southern climes, and Asia's warmer heaven, Fix'd with delight her European throne Oe'r favor'd realms, and regions all her own. Cheer'd by her sway each slumbering Muse awakes, And from her smiles superior vigor takes: Now Poesy with animating fire Throws her bold fingers o'er the Epic wire, And Lyric Extasy exulting sings Borne on the Theban eagle's towering wings, While the chaste Drama rising by degrees, By care successive polish'd, learns to please, From the rude outlines of the mimic art First shewn by Thespis in his wandering cart, To the fam'd Bards whose labor'd scenes engage The dumb attention of the Attic stage. Soon every Science, every Art succeeds, Happy to follow where a Sister leads. Charm'd from her seats on Egypt's watery plain, And freed from fabling Error's mystic chain, Through the still gloom of Academus' shade Philosophy with solemn footstep stray'd; Bold Imitation still to Nature true The perfect form from perfect models drew, For ne'er were equall'd Grecia's lovely race Or for the faultless shape, or beauteous face. Music devoid of each capricious art Touch'd with her sweetest melody the heart: And Architecture plann'd, in awful state The Dome with just proportion simply great, Or nobly plain the Doric pile appear'd, Or her light column soft Ionia rear'd, Or Corinth bade her polish'd Temples rise With ornamental grandeur to the skies. With force united this illustrious train Grac'd the loud forum, and the holy fane, But chiefly were their magic charms combin'd When the lov'd Drama fix'd the Athenian mind: Whether the drops of generous pity spring At the sad fate of Thebes' unhappy King, Or glows the exulting heart with patriot flame To hear the tale of Grecia's ancient fame, On this delightful source of virtuous joy The lavish Arts their choicest skill employ, And all their various powers at once convene To dress in gorgeous pomp the attractive scene. Encourag'd thus by Freedom's favoring smiles, While every Muse the listening ear beguiles, While Wisdom grave, and polish'd Grace combine, At once to form the Virtues, and refine, Improvement spreads to life's more humble cares, And Industry the happy influence shares: Down the steep cliff, and o'er the craggy brow Strong Agriculture drives his laboring plow, And to the currents of the rising gale Adventurous Commerce trusts her swelling sail; To the bleak rock the cultur'd glebe succeeds, Where waves the harvest and the vintage bleeds, And the fraught vessel with her woven wings The wealth of nations to Piræus brings. Rous'd by those honors cull'd by Glory's hand To dress the Victor on the Olympic sand, With active toil each ardent stripling tries To bind his forehead with the immortal prize; Hence strength and beauty deck the Grecian race, And manly labor gives them manly grace.— Yet while the scenes of Nature and of Art The perfect forms of elegance impart, While Wisdom's sacred lore the bosom warms, And brighter Virtue boasts her moral charms, The bliss in social intercourse that lies Unknown they lose, or knowing they despise, Illiberal folly 'midst their mirth we find, And savage grossness taints the noblest mind, The genial board licentious sports beguile, And sages woo the harlot's venal smile. For the soft Sex whose mild enchanting power With gentle pleasure cheers the festal hour, Denied the banquet's temperate joys to share, Are the mere drudges made of houshold care; Hence faint the force of that refin'd desire Which modest Beauty only can inspire. To other paths diverted passion turns, And with enthusiast ardor Friendship burns.— Far be it from the virgin Muse to try O'er that mysterious scene to throw her eye. Enough for her, while every manly breast She sees in Virtue's purest radiance dress'd, Sees every heart, with patriot Glory warm, Check the proud war, or perish in the storm, To cry like Philip on that fatal plain Where Victory wept the sacred Thebans slain, Curs'd be the slanderous tongue that worth like this would stain. Though some prevailing characters we trace Through every nation of the Grecian race, Though Superstition, Manners, Speech, the same, One common origin to all proclaim; Though when the different states assembled stood By Pisa's shades, or fair Castalia's flood, Where each time-hallow'd rite conspir'd to draw On the full festival religious awe, By the mix'd forms of mutual converse taught The separate tribes congenial features caught; Yet Greece no general bond of empire found Which all her sons in one firm compact bound, But each republic as it's fabric rose Peculiar laws, peculiar customs chose. Sparta, where royal power's divided sway Alternate knew to govern and obey, Where Kings and People equal rule restrain'd, And rigid Law the only tyrant reign'd, Saw grave Politeness spread her sober grace, And Modesty suffuse the warrior's face: No subtle reasoning mov'd her steady throng, But every sentence clear, concise, and strong, In artless guise the speaker's mind convey'd, And simple language simple truths display'd: No Luxury debauch'd her frugal train, For public glory there, was private gain. While Athens, where alike with frantic zeal All aim'd by turns to guide the general weal, For wide her blessings ample Freedom threw, And every voice an equal suffrage knew; Athens' beheld her sons forego their claim, The substance quitting for the shadowy name, And noisy Faction at Ambition's call Usurp'd that empire which belong'd to all, While specious Demagogues seduced the sense With all the flowery tropes of eloquence, And the free audience polish'd, and severe, Mark'd each oration with a critic ear. In vain might Prudence raise her warning voice If soft persuasion won the public choice, In vain it's aims might patriot care pursue If one mistaken accent censure drew. Awaken'd thus to every thrill of joy While arts of elegance their thoughts employ, Borne by the tide of eloquence along, Mov'd by a tale, a fable, or a song, Of their own delegated powers afraid, Despising laws by their own suffrage made, The fickle race impatient of control Rush headlong onward to Corruption's goal: What patriot sage to turn the current tries Is doom'd to exile, or by poison dies, And him they raise who impudent and loud Inflames the passions of the giddy croud: And though Invasion with remorseless hand Spread flame and carnage o'er the groaning land, The Theatre employs their sole debate, And more they prize the Drama than the state: If the fond scene present some favorite theme, Lull'd by sweet Fancy's vain delusive dream, Of Persia check'd and Greece preserv'd they boast Though conquering Philip ravages their coast, And Marathon's victorious deeds display On the dread eve of Chæronea's day. Of human glory thus how short the date! Expence and Pride, on Wealth and Freedom wait, And from her burthen'd lap Profusion throws The seeds of growing Vice, and future woes.— The fervent zeal of public spirit dead, And patriot Virtue's manly influence fled, The daring bands of freemen who defied In fields of blood the Median Tyrant's pride, Purchas'd, betray'd, divided, and o'erthrown, Bend to a state their sires had hardly known. Yet Science lov'd to breathe her favorite air, Though Liberty was fled still linger'd there. Even of those Chiefs who shar'd the unjust command Which Philip and his greater son had plann'd, Some brave descendants felt the Muses charms, And sooth'd with liberal Arts usurping Arms; Warm Patronage awhile with partial ray Supply'd the loss of Freedom's genuine day, And Genius consecrates to deathless fame With grateful voice her Philadelphus' name. Though mad Ambition soon with impious blow Laid every fence of civil Virtue low, And sunk in sloth, or petrified by fear, No daring arm oppos'd her wild career, Yet ne'er did abject Luxury's domain O'er Grecia stretch her universal reign, Or Asiatic Indolence dispense That blasting torpor to each blunted sense, Chill'd by whose touch the generous Purpose flies, Droops Emulation, faded Glory dies, While the corrupted heart each vice imbibes That sinks mankind below the bestial tribes. Religion, Language, Manners, though we find Give one strong tincture to the Grecian mind, Yet different Interest each republic draws, Divided Claims, and independent Laws, The neighbouring states eternal war alarms, And ease invaded yields to manlier arms; Whence strict the rules of discipline remain, And firm their courage on the embattled plain. Though by compulsion strong, and stronger art, Philip could temporary peace impart, With potent gold a shameful union bought Which public Wisdom oft had vainly sought, Short was the race by his Ambition run, And short the glory of his conquering son; Then as the spoils of empire to divide Contending chiefs with impious ardor tried, And Freedom bade some bolder states unite To guard with ancient zeal her sacred right, The doubtful conflict for a time call'd forth The dormant relics of heroic worth, Till every weak distinction swept away By the full tide of Rome's superior sway, Whate'er the stores of Grecian art supplied, Serv'd but to swell the happier Victor's pride; And haughty Luxury asham'd to own O'er tributary realms a partial throne, Attends the rising power by Fate design'd To fix her boundless empire o'er mankind. Lo! in the regions whence Favonius blows A hardy race Hesperia's vales disclose: With sinews firm the rugged offspring rise And brave the force of less auspicious skies, For freezing winds had erst Campania known, And yellow Tiber worn an icy zone. The sons of Rome ne'er felt the soft control Of milky kindness stealing o'er the soul, Nor did their nerves to pleasure's touch awake Of gentler thoughts the mild impression take; The rigid texture of their rougher frame The dangerous glories of the field inflame; To wage with sure success the bloody fight Their favorite care, and war their sole delight. Victors, or vanquish'd, by the example taught They found new paths to conquest as they fought. Triumphant Carthage vaunts her powers in vain And claims the exclusive empire of the main, Rome to the sea her ductile Genius turns, And from her foe the means of Victory learns; Repairs with wiser toil the ruin'd fleet, And gains superior art from each defeat, Her naval care with perseverance plies, Till, by the course of long experience wise, The watery war her perfect gallies dare, And Libya's ancient splendor melts to air. In vain to check these unremitting foes Their studied Tactics Grecia's sons oppose, Whose force compelling countless hosts to yield, With Persia's bleeding Myriads strew'd the field: The Legions active, disciplin'd, and fierce, With varied shock the close-wedg'd Phalanx pierce, And Freedom's noblest sons are doom'd by fate The servile subjects of a foreign state. Their country vanquish'd, still the arts remain, Still learned Athens boasts her polish'd train; The flowery garlands there they weave to bind In pleasures roseate wreaths the Roman mind, The joys of peace the haughty Victors learn, And Greece exulting triumphs in her turn. Though first they view with undiscerning eyes Sculpture's fair grace, and Painting's glowing dyes, Though Consuls by the piece the marble rate, And the wrought brass is valu'd by the weight; Yet soon their hearts the Muses sway confess'd And powerful numbers sooth'd the warlike breast, Each swelling bosom caught the generous fire, And Roman fingers struck the Grecian lyre: Not with that fierce delight, that sudden glow Which from the genuine beams of Nature flow, That burst of Harmony which pour'd along The full luxuriance of the Epic Song!— Matur'd by time their ripening Genius rose, From the harsh lines of Ennius' measur'd prose To strains on which the Muse enamour'd hung, And drank each dulcet note from Maro's tongue. But ne'er shall Imitation's loveliest charm Like native Grace the raptur'd bosom warm, This bright and awful as the beam of day, That like the paler moon's reflected ray. By no fallacious hues does Nature please, But boldly gives the manners that she sees, Not Truth in Fiction's splendid garb arrays, But with free stroke the living form portrays, Her Bards divine the real actions sing Of the stern Hero, or the warrior King, Or paint the life the amorous Shepherd leads In the rich verdure of Sicilian meads, While with the verse their heated Fancy weaves Each sacred tale Mythology believes: But Imitation with correcter hand Fills but the outline that Invention plann'd, With care retrenches each superfluous part, Or adds the tinsel ornaments of art, Describes the manners that she never knew, And faintly copies what her Mistress drew; Hence with assiduous step the Latian Muse The march sublime of elder Greece pursues, Content to glean with unremitting toil The scatter'd produce of her happier soil. And now the improving sons of Rome behold The scenes of Attic elegance unfold, Admire the fane by sculptur'd Nature graced, And catch from every glance congenial taste: The Capitol by conquering Consuls trod Receives with friendly rite each marble God, In bend majestic swells the Parian arch Through which in solemn pomp the Victors march; Rome with delight the pleasing toil pursues, And emulates the beauties that she views, Exults in arts and artists of her own, Bids the warm canvass breathe, and animates the stone. Happy had Rome adorn'd by spoils like these Been satisfied with Grecian Arts to please! But Asia's subject regions now disclose The fatal sources of unnumber'd woes.— Each delegated chief who us'd of yore To guide the thundering battle's furious roar, Bind the green laurel round his conquering brow, And then return contented to the plow, Now proudly stretches with rapacious hand O'er plunder'd provinces his harsh command; Loaded with wealth the stern Proconsuls come, And eastern splendor dazzles wondering Rome. Caught with the lustre of the shining ore The charms of Poverty can please no more, The ancient fame of frugal heroes dies, And venal hopes, and venal passions rise; The honest boast of Democratic pride Is drown'd in dark Corruption's swelling tide, And Freedom's awful rights are basely sold For the vile barter of barbaric gold. No more Rome's venerable Senate flings Dismay and terror o'er usurping kings; No more the injur'd Nations grateful see Oppression tremble at her just decree; No more her sword is drawn in Glory's cause For rights betray'd, or violated laws: The Tyrant buys impunity for vice, And every public outrage has it's price: Avarice can fix a giddy people's choice, And servile legions arm at Faction's voice. In vain a few with steady courage stood, To stem the torrent of the whelming flood, The selfish passions with insidious force Of patriot worth had poison'd every source; Still lawless power uprear'd her hydra head, And Freedom was no more though Cæsar bled. Intent the aims of faction to compleat, Now smoother Cunning seiz'd Ambition's seat.— A Youth unmov'd by pity or by rage, As Manhood firm, yet cold as palsied Age, Hiding in specious guile his cruel views, The impious scheme with ceaseless toil pursues. His wiles, the work of ages to destroy, Severity and ease by turns employ; Death's stern decrees, or friendship's milder call, Allure the timid, or the bold appal: The enchanting Muses, whose delightful art Can bend the stubborn purpose of the heart, His voice invokes to charm the attentive mind, And hide the fetters that inslave mankind. The Muses hear!—forgetful that their sway Was first produced in Freedom's happier day They hear, and mindless of their ancient worth, Betray the parent power that gave them birth, Adore the Author of their country's doom, And seal the fate of Liberty and Rome. After a dreadful scene of war and woes, The brazen gates of two-faced Janus close, The sad effects of civil discord cease, And all a restless world is wrapp'd in peace. By Actium's Victory stopp'd the fatal strife, No more the dire proscription threatens life, No more the bloody scroll of Death appears, But Mercy's snowy garb Augustus wears. The gentler Arts each harsher care beguile, And Science grows beneath his fostering smile: Around his throne the laughing Loves resort, And own the influence of a peaceful court. Pleasures refin'd that Grecia never knew Croud to the sight, and bless the raptur'd view: To the pert quaintness of Socratic wit, Or the rude jests that lower manners fit, To feasts where sage disputes the hours employ, Or the loose revels of licentious joy, Succeeds that intercourse of sweet delight, Though gay not vicious, and though free polite, Their mingled gifts where ease and mirth dispense, Ease void of roughness, mirth restrain'd by sense: And lovely Woman, though not taught to know That public homage later days bestow, With modest smiles domestic converse graced, And soften'd by her looks each ruder taste. Even Freedom though her sacred power was fled O'er Manners yet a parting radiance shed, On the warm heart was Virtue's form impress'd, And dauntless Courage fir'd the warrior's breast. The generous youth in Mars' gymnastic field By manly sports his hardy sinews steel'd, Curb'd the bold steed, the dusty conflict stood, Or plung'd his glowing limbs in Tiber's flood, Science a milder charm to Valor gave, And Empire seem'd to polish, not enslave, Rome equal Arms, superior Arts could boast, And hardly deem'd her ancient Glory lost. But short the light of Pleasure's transient gleam! Soon Nature starting from the illusive dream Shrinks back affrighted as her eyes survey The horrid form of arbitrary sway.— Monsters who built on vice their dreadful joy, Proud of their crimes and happy to destroy, Seiz'd the vast power that Freedom's sons resign'd, And shook the rod of vengeance o'er mankind; Life hung alone upon a tyrant's breath, And each capricious frown awarded death. Amid the waste of years though haply shine A Titus, Trajan, or an Antonine, The short-liv'd interval more strongly shews The striking contrast of despotic woes. What force can free the mind that Vice has chain'd, Or clear the current if the fountain's stain'd?— No distant regions happier hopes afford Beneath the empire of a milder lord; Fear still beholds where'er her eye she flings, Subjected states, and tributary kings; And Power o'ertakes the exile as he goes O'er Libyan deserts, or through Scythian snows. Condemn'd the endless scenes of blood to see, While looks are watch'd, and hardly thought is free, In Rome's sad inmates, now a wretched race, No more the marks of ancient worth we trace, In the dull soul, a stupid, lifeless void, Rous'd by no action, by no cares employ'd, Each fading Energy of Virtue dies, As droops the plant beneath inclement skies. The cohorts from the frontier distant far In slothful ease forget the toils of war, Or from their camp with factious arms o'erawe The weak remains of Freedom and of Law, O'er Senates with tumultuous force prevail, And set the Empire of the world to sale. The Muse no more with native beauty warms But tricks with art her meretricious charms: Science in simple form, and semblance chaste, Offends the alter'd times degenerate taste. Each social Charity of private life, The smiling offspring, and the tender wife, Now cease the scene domestic to endear: For who can wish a wretched race to rear Slaves to a cruel tyrant's fickle gust, Rods of his power, or minions of his lust?— To the sweet joys that blushing Beauty gave Succeeds the traffick of the female slave, Till sated the perverted Fancy roves To monstrous pleasures, and unseemly loves. Debarr'd each just pursuit, the restless mind Seeks in flagitious deeds relief to find, In sensual cares grows exquisitely nice, And only seeks variety of vice. Their stores the tributary realms supply To glut even Luxury's insatiate eye; For Italy, while Rome no rival knew, Ere yet Byzantium's sister empire grew, Saw on her shores contending nations meet To lay their various produce at her feet. Commerce who independent states can draw To equal compact by her general law, Who weighs what nature gives and what denies, While mutual barter mutual want supplies, Exulting Rome contemn'd, who saw unfurl'd Her conquering banners o'er a subject world, And her proud offspring buoy'd by ancient fame, Not gain by purchase, but by empire claim. All that the warmer southern climes dispense Fair to the eye, and grateful to the sense, Whatever eastern regions can afford To grace the mansion, or to deck the board, In endless heaps the imperial seat supplied, Her pleasure gratified, or sooth'd her pride, At the full feast to indolence resign'd, Lie the soft race on purple beds reclin'd, And o'er the room in many a crimson fold The arras hangs with ivory rough and gold: Of massive plate the attentive slaves produce The meanest vessels of domestic use, And in rich mists the cooling odors shed Ambrosial fragrance round the listless head, Through the wide dome the fumes of incense roll, And Grecia's purest vintage crowns the bowl. A nation's wealth their lavish fancies waste To furnish viands for one great repast; And Luxury her bloated form so swells We scarcely credit what th' Historian tells. To load the table when the Tyrant fed, Seas have been drain'd, and Hecatombs have bled; The Euxine mourn'd her shores despoil'd of fish, And woods unpeopled form'd one costly dish; Even when the calls of appetite were o'er, And Nature's loaded powers could act no more, With brutal skill were shameful means pursu'd, That blunted hunger's sickly force renew'd, In the pall'd taste could false desires excite, And goad the sated sense to fresh delight. In constant scenes like these enervate grown, The slaves of Lust and Gluttony alone, No joy beyond voluptuous ease they deem, And small exertions cruel hardships seem, From Indolence, and Vice their pleasures flow, And Fear's the only active power they know: Too selfish e'er to think of public care, Too weak the weight of manly arms to bear, A Favorite's nod degenerate legions wait, And servile Eunuchs regulate the state. Firm discipline is lost by long neglect, And mercenary hosts the throne protect. Weaken'd by Constantine's misjudging pride Whose vain designs the imperial strength divide, Open and wide the extended frontier lay, To each barbarian hord an easy prey: On every side the ruffian bands contend, By turns invade them, and by turns defend, Till lur'd by wealth and splendor's tempting prize, The warlike tribes such coward chiefs despise, Against the trembling race their swords employ, And spread destruction round with savage joy, Pour o'er each region like a wintry flood, And Rome's diminish'd empire sets in blood. Of the long sway of twice six hundred years Stupendous fabrick! scarce a wreck appears, Save a poor remnant as the ruin falls Preserv'd to languish in Byzantium's walls. Now through the extent of Nature's wide domain Once more the horrid powers of darkness reign, Again Chaotic ignorance rears her head, And o'er mankind her sable veil is spread. What scatter'd arts survive the general doom Retreat to wither in the cloister's gloom; And if by chance from thence some sickly beam Shoots faintly forth a transitory gleam, It serves but like the meteor's lurid light To add new horror to the shades of night.

As when stern Winter's desolating power, Arm'd with the piercing frost, and sleety shower, O'er shivering Nature spreads it's iron reign, Bare stands the grove, and waste extends the plain; Yet in the scatter'd seed, and buried root The embryo blossom hides, prepar'd to shoot When Spring with milder influence shall prevail, And balmy Zephyrs breathe the genial gale: So, wrapp'd in Ignorance, though the human heart No vivid hues retain of ancient art, Yet still the dormant seeds expectant there Await the hour of Cultivation's care; Still verdant scions from the root shall grow When mild Occasion's fostering breezes blow, To bud and bloom again with Parent worth, And emulate the stock that gave them birth. Yet as the culture asks severer toil When poisonous weeds o'errun the useless soil; So Reason labors long to bend the breast Where Error's barbarous tenets are impress'd: Soon learns the untutor'd thought with generous aim To catch the glow of Virtue's holy flame, But where strong forms of Prejudice deprave The simpler rules that untaught Nature gave, Ere yet Refinement with her gentle rein The impatient course of giddy sense restrain. There every dreadful passion will impart Superior horror to the vicious heart, And fill the annals of the unhappy times With dire events, and unexampled crimes. The ruffian tribes that pour'd tumultuous forth In countless myriads from the frozen North, By no soft touch of milder manners graced, Rapacious inmates of the howling waste, 'Mid the vast wild of Scandinavian plains, Of tempest and of cold the drear domains, A system fram'd, whose universal sway The varied race with common zeal obey, From where the wintry surges foaming break Of the loud Baltic, to the Caspian lake.— Boldly they vaunt with unsubmitting soul To scorn of sovereign power the strong control, Yet to the rule of martial order yield, And own a Monarch on the embattled field. By Victory crown'd, the chiefs with equal pride In different lots the subject realms divide, And the fierce leader of each separate hord Reigns o'er his share an independent lord, What arms had won maintaining by the sword. For though each stern commander homage paid When War's loud clarion claim'd the promis'd aid, The tumult o'er, no civil force remain'd That Anarchy's impetuous rage restrain'd: Each haughty chief could regal justice awe, And mock the uncertain rules of feeble law. In constant feuds the ungovern'd tribes engage, And the dire battle Hate and Vengeance wage. No pity unrelenting Conquest shews, But the fell tyrant spoils his weaker foes, Licentious Rapine leads the furious train And Age, and Rank, and Beauty plead in vain. Though Prejudice may warp, or Passion blind Awhile, the honest purpose of the mind, Yet to the conscious soul of man belong The love of Justice, and the hate of Wrong; Firm, though obscur'd, the sacred dictates stand Implanted there by Heaven's creative hand. Hence while loud Discord bids with giant pride Sad Desolation o'er the realms preside, Some nobler breasts neglected Virtue draws To arm and vindicate her injur'd cause: Uncheck'd by doubt, by danger undismay'd, Prompt to redress when sorrow claims their aid, With equal hand they deal the avenging blow, And lay with joy the oppressive tyrant low; But chief they glory when the generous care Of weeping Beauty calls them to the war, With dauntless arms her suppliant power they guard, And deem her favoring smiles a full reward. For the rough tribes thro' Northern wilds that stray'd To female merit early deference paid, The gentler sex partook the grave debate, And more than shar'd the arduous toils of state. The hardy warrior whose indignant mind No arm could vanquish, and no law could bind, To their commands a willing homage gave, And each unconquer'd knight was Beauty's slave. Amid the crimes that barbarous rudeness knows Thus the fair form of Chivalry arose, Join'd love's soft glow to valor's fiercer flame, And mildly sooth'd the intemperate thirst of fame. It's influence still, defying change and time, Spreads o'er each modern European clime, Lives spite of fickle mode's capricious rage, And marks the manners of a polish'd age. Though the rude Nations in their inroads bore The wild Mythology of Northern lore, Yet soon the splendor of the Roman rite Caught with it's mystic glare their dazzled sight. To charm their grosser sense the Priests combine Each monstrous fiction with a faith divine; And all that feverish Fancy knows to paint, The virgin martyr, and the warrior saint, The fabled cure, and legendary tale, With force resistless o'er their thoughts prevail. While such the general impulse of the mind, To Superstition, and to Arms inclin'd, A frantic Hermit with enthusiast breath Kindles the dreadful flames of war and death: ‘Arouse ye chiefs of valiant fame!’ He cries, ‘Lo! Heaven and Glory, point the bold emprise!— ‘No more at human pity's humbler call ‘On man's oppressors let your vengeance fall, ‘Behold on Solyma's afflicted lands ‘The injur'd Deity your zeal demands! ‘The sacred ground by dying martyrs trod, ‘The seats made holy by a bleeding GOD, ‘Mohammed's sons with impious orgies stain, ‘And soil the hallow'd earth with rites profane, ‘Bid resignation's patient votaries feel ‘The pangs of trying flame, and torturing steel, ‘Pollute with murder'd saints the dome divine, ‘And wash with blood Jehovah's awful shrine. ‘Go forth my sons! and with religious care ‘Spread your cross-banners streaming to the air! ‘Secure of praise! secure of conquest go! ‘And wreak heaven's vengeance on a heathen foe; ‘Fame's deathless guerdon shall the victor gain, ‘And crowns immortal sanctify the slain!’ Fired by such words unusual ardors rise, And far and wide the swift contagion flies, All ranks, all orders to the impression yield, And swarming millions croud the tented field. Not such the numbers Xerxes led of yore From hostile Persia to the Grecian shore, When his proud fleet the indignant billows chain'd, And thirsty hosts the failing river drain'd. The rash design though pious folly plann'd, Though discord soon dissolv'd the inconstant band, From scenes of war yet milder manners grew, And man advantage from destruction drew. The haughty chief to arm his numerous train, And grace with martial pomp the glittering plain, The wide demesnes of ancient tenure sold, And fiefs enfranchis'd for the wanted gold: Whence the freed peasant chearful tills the soil, And busy Commerce plies her active toil. While as the countless hosts in long array Through eastern Europe bend their tedious way, And view with wondering eyes the gay resort Of wealth, and splendor, to Byzantium's court, The wrecks of Roman pride, and Grecian skill With new delight the astonish'd bosom fill. Though lur'd by Rapine, war unjust they wage, And waste the Arts with more than Vandal rage, Yet soon to scenes of elegance awake, A softer turn, and nobler aims they take, Each curious relic while they spoil admire, And plundering works of taste, that taste acquire. Even from the mixture of Arabian foes On the barbarian West improvement rose: The Saracen had learn'd with liberal heart To love the paths of Science, and of Art, The splendors of magnificence had known, And deck'd in pomp each oriental throne, But most his glowing Fancy lov'd to rove Amid the devious maze of Fiction's grove, And the luxuriance of the fabling lay Struck Europe's ruder Bards with forceful sway; The minstrel now who tun'd his Gothic lyre To teach the son the achievements of the sire, Blends with the dreadful tale of blood and arms, What eastern legends tell of magic charms, Heightens the horror of the furious fight With the wing'd dragon, and the enchanted knight, And bids the bold Romance the hearer move With the mix'd powers of Wonder, War, and Love. While thus the Muse enjoys her infant dream, Coy Reason still conceals her golden beam. Rome's ancient language in impervious folds From vulgar eyes each source of Wisdom holds, And as they list the subtle Priests dispense The scanty shares of knowledge and of sense. Hence Learning rose, who insolent, and proud, Looks down contemptuous on the admiring croud: While, as unmeaning rules the hearer vex, And artful doubts the wilder'd thought perplex, In the strict bands of letter'd form confin'd, Peculiar prejudice enslaves the mind. Unlike Philosophy's bold sons of old Who freely question'd what the instructor told, O'eraw'd by Pride in education's hours The timid mind distrusts it's opening powers, Worships each mystic knot by Error tied, And blindly follows where it's teachers guide. Rome's legal Code at length on Naples' coast By chance recover'd, as by ravage lost, Soon wiser laws, the work of many an age, Plann'd by the Prince, the Statesman, and the Sage, Mix with the edicts fram'd in Error's school, And smooth the rigid form of Gothic rule; Wisdom unseals charm'd Reason's drowsy eyes, And once again Astræa leaves the skies. Themis abash'd, her folly taught to feel, Less frequent makes to heaven the rash appeal, And blushes to decide the doubtful right By burning Ordeal, or the listed fight. The haughty noble quits the civil sword, And the gown'd Judge succeeds the feudal Lord, Impartial Justice curbs the oppressive deed, And Science smiles from savage licence freed. Now from the Abbey's solitary site The imperfect glimmerings shone of classic light. The still recluse condemn'd for years to pore O'er the dull leaf of theologic lore, Awhile would quit fatigu'd the toilsome page To view the spoils of learning's happier age. As there his curious eyes delighted trace The thoughts congenial of a warrior race, The attractive charm his ruder style refines, And with more art romantic fable shines. Those precious relics of imperial Rome That haply chanc'd to 'scape the general doom, The scatter'd monuments of old delight, Strike the warm Fancy, and her powers excite: The Latian Muse avows her native clime, And drops the fervile bands of monkish rhyme: While flying from Romania's ruin'd shore Westward the Greeks their exil'd learning bore. O had bright Science then with perfect grace Her potent influence shed o'er Europe's race! Their victor armies at Musurus' call Musurus was one of those learned Greeks that fled into Ilaly, on the destruction of the Eastern Empire, and were patronized by Leo X. to whom he addressed a Poem in classical Greek, imploring him to excite the arms of the Christian world against the Turks. The Poem is printed at the end of Dr. Foster's defence of Greek accents: in which treatise is a happy application of the line in the old Epigram alluded to V. 239. ??????? ???? ????????, [] ??????? ?????? ?????., Had chased the foe from fad Byzantium's wall. That source whence verse it's purest charms deriv'd, The glorious voice of Greece, had then surviv'd; The docile ear by living masters taught Had from their speech the genuine accents caught, In native tones the Attic Muse had sung, Nor mourn'd like Philomel her mangled tongue. Again Hesperia's happy seats behold The sacred laurels bud that bloom'd of old. Chear'd and protected by the papal throne, The rising arts a Leo's bounty own. Starts from the sculptur'd stone the breathing frame To emulate the forms of ancient fame; The speaking canvass boasts a livelier hue Than e'er Apelles' plastic pencil drew, As Raphael's lines, or Titian's glowing dye, Bid the bold picture strike the enchanted eye. In Tuscan numbers Tasso's powers display The solemn grandeur of the Epic lay; While Vida tunes to Roman strains the wire With Virgil's sweetness, and with Virgil's fire. And even from northern Belgia Science draws Superior strength to vindicate her cause. The tedious manuscript no longer foils The verbal copyist's persevering toils, No more the expensive volumes only wait To deck the palace of the rich and great, On letter'd art the press new strength bestows, And ampler rays diffusive learning throws. The increasing powers of ripening sense pervade The gloomy stillness of the cloister's shade, Destroy the bonds that Reason's force confin'd, And burst the fetters that enchain'd the mind. Though the lone Abbey from barbarian rage Sav'd the bright ruins of the classic page; Though sometimes meek Religion's holy form Would faintly shine through Superstition's storm: Yet every vice that shuns the face of day Work'd in monastic night it's secret way; Each impious wile the Church unceasing tries, That spreads her empire, or her stores supplies; Now on the expiring votary's heart employs The enchanting vision of seraphic joys, Now bids despair attend the parting breath, And plants with thorns the trembling bed of death; Draws from the fears of langour and of pain The rich possession, and the wide domain, On the sad Widow's spoil the altar rears, And bathes the sacred fane with Orphan tears. Drunk with the vast excess of wealth and power, Unmindful of returning Reason's hour, She boldly prostitutes the laws of Heaven, And for vile lucre is the indulgence given. Crimes even that Nature shudders to behold Obtain their pardon for the stated gold, And impious leave for future Vice is sold. But the long reign of Gothic night is pass'd, And Wisdom's awful morning dawns at last, The fierce anathemas unheeded come, And Luther shakes the enormous power of Rome. The forms of Falshood strive in vain to bear The trying search of Truth's ethereal spear. Even those less happy regions that remain Press'd by the weight of Error's galling chain, Immers'd in clouds of darkness though they seem, Catch a faint twilight from the distant beam: Convinc'd that true Religion's piercing eye Will every source of pious fraud descry, The furious Priest corrects his cruel zeal, And milder sway the breathing nations feel, Mercy's soft calls the bigot's wrath assuage, And papal thunder loses half it's rage. In Gaul the contrast strongly mark'd appears Of Reason's force, and Error's gloomy fears: With fond delight her partial eye surveys Each hallow'd prejudice of earlier days, Yet though her sons with ancient rite adore The legendary saints that liv'd of yore, Oft arm'd by hate though Persecution stood, And drench'd Lutetia's walls with native blood; Her's was the earliest boast with lenient care To form soft Courtesy's attractive air; Throw o'er the willing mind Politeness' chains, And raise that empire which she yet maintains. But on Britannia's shores with ample sway Religion's purest charms their power display.— As the dread earthquake and the raging storm The high behests of awful heaven perform, So a proud tyrant's disappointed aims Broke the strong tie of Rome's despotic claims. The labors by the haughty sire begun Attain perfection from the pious son; And though a female's bigot zeal succeeds, Burns the firm martyr, and the patriot bleeds, While stand Iberia's sons exulting by And civil Freedom mark with harpy eye, The transient terror flies, like vapors driven By sweeping Eurus o'er the face of heaven, And Worship freed from each polluting stain, Adorns the annals of Eliza's reign. Hail glorious Queen! in whose propitious hour The towering structure rose of Britain's power. Let the Historian laboring to impart His favorite paradox with envious art, Invoke capricious Malice to deface The scene of Albion's ripening strength and grace: Still shall the voice of former times be heard To vindicate that worth our sires rever'd. 'Twas thine to bid Britannia's native force Check rash Invasion in her headlong course, Old Ocean's waves with prows triumphant sweep, And reign unrivall'd o'er the subject deep: Thine too the milder glory to increase The gentle sway of Courtesy and Peace. Though Artists with fastidious look behold The dome it's rude magnificence unfold, Though modern Elegance affect to scorn The rougher Manners which thy court adorn, Yet sure some reverential awe shall wait Each venerable pile of ancient state; Yet sure some bosom even those days shall charm, When Love romantic, strengthening Valor's arm, Call'd each heroic passion boldly forth, And gave the admiring world a Sydney's worth. The expectant Muse at length with joyful eyes The rising hope of ancient fame descries. Melodious Spenser while his cares refine The wild redundance of the Saxon line, On Gothic fable rears his rich machine, And sings the paynim foe and elfin Queen: While like the laurel'd son of Grecian fame Immortal Shakespear burns with native flame.— Unequall'd Bard! the grateful Muse shall raise To thee the monument of deathless praise, Nor interweave one flower of foreign bloom Amid the votive wreaths that deck thy tomb: For no faint blaze from elder learning caught Rais'd in thy breast the imitative thought; Nor shall my verse compare thy wonderous page With the best scenes of Athens' perfect stage, Or of thy Phœnix wing a rival own Save the Mæonian Prodigy alone. A numerous train of tuneful Bards succeed, Strike the loud lyre, or fill the warbling reed. In the just pride of inborn Genius bold, Yet taught by every Muse that charm'd of old, Soaring with eagle eye, and eagle flight, Amid the realms of empyrean light, Lo Milton throws with daring hand away The splendid fetters of the Runic lay! While Dryden's clear harmonious notes rehearse The humblest subject in the sweetest verse, Nor ask the figur'd style or pompous phrase, From common speech his simplest lines to raise; Yet when some theme with energy sublime, Calls forth the wonders of his varied rhyme, 'Tis his to catch the animating fire, Bid the bold strain to giddy heights aspire, Rival the Mantuan swan, or mate the Theban lyre. But while fair Poesy with favoring smile Beholds her votaries thrive in Albion's isle, The meeker Arts with trembling step explore Some safe asylum on a foreign shore, For o'er her fields stern War terrific stood, And long and dreadful raged the thirst of blood.— Though the poetic bay with changeless form Braves the worst fury of the thundering storm, The inferior flowers that paint the shelter'd vale, Shrink at the breath of every ruder gale.— Soon polish'd Gallia's hospitable plain Yields a kind refuge to the exil'd train, For civil Fury from her seats was flown, And Monarchy had fix'd her stable throne, Their gifts the smiling powers of Peace disclose, And Lewis there a new Augustus rose: A Prince's wiles again the Arts invoke With magic touch to lighten Slavery's yoke, Reason's keen eye with skilful care to blind, And turn from Freedom's view the active mind. The grateful race encourag'd by his sway The patronage with ample bounty pay, Give what his fleets and armies ne'er could claim, Unsullied glory, and unenvied fame. For though a British Muse would blush to aid The guilty fabric by Ambition made, Yet to impartial rules of Justice true She gives the praise to real Merit due.— Not opening Science nor encourag'd Art Alone their lustre to his reign impart: The splendid period by his care refin'd Marks a strong era of the improving Mind. By him new modell'd wondering Europe saw Her ancient Arms, her Manners, and her Law. Though dear the price each fair attainment cost, When in the exchange was Independence lost. Beauty with sense endow'd, with sweetness graced, Sits the chief arbitress of soften'd taste, And fame attends, as her applauding eyes Of valor or of wit, award the prize. No more the rural Lord mid distant plains O'er vassal fiefs a little tyrant reigns; To the gay circle of the Monarch's court All Power, all Splendor, and all Arts resort, There steep'd in joy the nobler race reside And change for royal smiles provincial pride. While marshall'd Discipline with studious care Gives a new semblance to the forms of War: No more, their stated service forced to yield, Untrain'd the hasty levies throng the field, No more the stripling of illustrious birth Leads armies by hereditary worth: An order of the state the Soldier stands, And though a slave himself the rest commands, Derives his rank from regal will alone, And only pays obedience to the throne. While Gallia thus a general power obtains And guides mankind by soft Opinion's reins, Long was the scene of bleeding Britain's woes Ere from the strife emerging Peace arose. Each party yields at times, at times prevails, As changing Fortune lifts her dubious scales; Till lost, or scatter'd, Virtue's Patriot train, Her cause deserted, and her Hambden slain, Contending sects fulfill'd a Tyrant's view, And Faction seiz'd the sword that Freedom drew; In civil rage each gentler care was drown'd, And fierce on joy the wild Enthusiast frown'd. Nor when reviving Albion saw restor'd Her ravish'd sceptre, and her legal lord, Did liberal art the polish'd lustre boast That mark'd each work of Gallia's rival coast, Licentious Vice a laughing court debas'd, And looser Manners tainted public Taste. Nor could a graver prince intent alone To change religion on his tottering throne, From a short reign of struggle and of care One transient smile to prostrate Science spare. And though we own with deference and with awe, The public virtues that adorn'd Nassau, Yet candor must confess his rigid mind No Pleasure sooth'd, no Elegance refin'd. At length Britannia's sons with transport view Another Queen their ancient fame renew, Once more the prize in Arts and Arms obtain, And see Eliza's days reviv'd in Anna's reign. Whate'er of wisdom, and whate'er of grace, Could form or dignify the human race, Taught Albion now her splendid worth to raise, Beyond the envied height of classic praise. For say could all the learned sage display'd In Academus, or the Tuscan shade, Compare with Newton, whose immortal force Pursued coy Nature to her inmost source, Or Locke who knew with lynx's eye to find Man's secret Soul, and analyse the Mind? Or shall Refinement in the brightest page Of Roman Splendor rival Anna's Age? Where, though Politeness now of freer school. Condemn Formality's too rigid rule, Adorn'd by Reason, Converse learn'd to please, And manly Dignity attemper'd Ease, Public attention waited conscious Worth, And liberal Manners mark'd illustrious Birth. The Muses too their tuneful powers employ, And the loud Pæan join of general joy: What though their voice strikes not the ravish'd ear With notes that Greece and Rome were wont to hear, Yet when sweet Pope's melodious lines convey The moral subject in the perfect lay, To British numbers charms unknown impart, And varied sounds combine with happiest art, Rapp'd with delight Aonia's listening throng Drink the soft accents of the dulcet song, And own the immortal strains of earlier time Are nearly rivall'd in a northern clime, By verse of Gothic frame and manacled with rhime. Though Britain must revere the kings who draw Their royal claims from Liberty and Law, In holy Freedom's pure regalia shine, And deem a People's Voice their Right Divine: Yet midst her patrons Science cannot place The earliest monarchs of the Brunswick race. No princely favor kindles Genius' flame; Or raises modest worth to wealth or fame; To private vanity the artists trust, Whence the stiff portrait, and the unmeaning bust, While her Pagodas gaudy China rears, And Cibber's brow the sullied laurel wears. But see! a Prince succeeds whose generous heart The liberal Patron glows of every art, The slumbering train warm'd by his chearing smile Break from their trance, and polish Albion's isle. Yet though Medusa's charm revers'd is shewn As Sculpture animates the Parian stone, By Architecture though the dome is graced With all the ornaments of Attic taste, Though drawn by Painting's animating hand With life, with character, the portraits stand; Yet Britain's candid sons must yield the prize To the bright influence of Italian skies, Where Guido's touch enthusiast rapture fir'd, And holy zeal a Raphael's tints inspir'd. Theirs be the unenvied triumph!—while applause From her inventive powers Britannia draws. The stores in Nature's rural empire placed To chuse with judgment, and arrange with taste, O'er the soft grace her genuine forms impart To throw the simple stole of decent Art, For the high fountain, and the pent cascade, Cyphers of turf, and cabinets of shade, To teach the wave in graceful bends to flow, To crown with wood the mountain's heathy brow, And bid the flower and blooming shrub succeed The rugged bramble, and the loathsome weed, This be her glory!—pleas'd to shine alone In native charms, and Beauty all her own: Secure her fame unhurt by time shall stand Since Mason's verse records what Brown has plann'd. But ah! while thus the Arts inferior train Thrive in the sunshine of a George's reign; Sweet Poesy, whose sacred powers exceed The Sculptor's chisel, and the Painter's reed, Whose pen has Virtue's moral shape design'd, And drawn the immortal image of the Mind, Whose magic sounds to melody dispense The flowers of Fancy, and the force of Sense; Sweet Poesy, neglected and forlorn, The feeble rays of patronage must mourn. By wealth or wisdom placed in happier state Though a bold few disdain to court the great; Though Mason frame the warm descriptive lay, Or strike the lyre with Pindar, and with Gray; Though listening Harmony with raptur'd ear Attentive stand, the enchanting notes to hear, As sailing on the rainbow-tinctur'd wings Of chaste Imagination, Hayley sings: In plaintive strains at sighing Friendship's call Though tuneful Seward mourn her Andre's fall, And wrap the felon cord that clos'd his breath In radiant Glory's amaranthine wreath; Tho' Warton young-ey'd Fancy's favorite child, On whose auspicious birth the Muses smil'd, And taught his glowing colors to portray The rural landscape, and the vernal day, With classic Art his flowing numbers fill, And join the Critic's to the Poet's skill; Yet as with streaming eye the sorrowing Muse Pale Chatterton's untimely urn bedews, Her accents shall arraign the partial care That shielded not her son from cold despair: And many a bard by frowning Fortune led To abject interest bows the venal head, Compell'd to point with cruel wit the dart That wing'd by malice rives the blameless heart, Or ideot pride by slavish notes to raise, And cast to swine the precious gems of praise. O let, Imperial George! the Muses share The kindly dews of thy parental care. Too oft has Poesy with servile aim By tyrants favor'd, sung a tyrant's fame, O let one monarch wake her nobler rage, And consecrate to Truth her holy page! Rais'd by thy hand, I see on Albion's plain The seeds of Grecian glory bloom again! See Genius plume once more her eagle wing, Hear other Homers, other Shakespears sing! And while their voice down time's eternal flood Wafts the clear honors of the Wise and Good, Ages unborn shall bless the just decree, And future Heroes owe their fame to thee. Here let us pause,—attentive to survey The present æra of Refinement's sway. As in some perfect scene of Britain's isle, Where all the charms of cultur'd Nature smile, To velvet lawns, and flowery shades, succeed The furrow'd champain, and the irriguous mead, Then woods, and heaths in soft perspective rise, Till rough the distant mountains meet the skies; So let our search the changing picture trace Through all the different tribes of human race; The strong gradations mark with curious eye Midst civil and barbarian life that lie, From Europe's crouded towns and inmates mild, To the rude savage, and the dreary wild. Conspicuous rising o'er the various scene, Of Arts and Arms, though Europe shine the Queen Yet even her offspring from Refinement share Unequal influence, and a partial care. With studious zeal the polish'd sons of France Lead up attractive Pleasure's airy dance, Each varied mark of character forsake One pliant form of general mode to take, The fairest wreaths from Courtesy to claim Their first ambition, and their proudest aim. Not so Britannia, on her bleaker plains Still wild Caprice in spite of Science reigns, No central court there all distinction draws, No judge directs of critic art the laws, All as they list presume to regulate The page of learning and the powers of state, Indignant cast each servile rule away, Nor even in Taste admit despotic sway.— No ductile texture can the mind acquire Mid Faction's storms, and Freedom's glowing fire: The amorous youth at Party's noisy call Quits for the grave debate the lively ball; And in the social scenes of softer grace Will Business oft intrude with serious face, While Politics on public cares decide, And settle Europe's rights by Beauty's side. Though Italy first saw reviving Art, And wakening Science sooth again the heart, She loiters now in Glory's bright career, Nor longer pants the prize of fame to wear; No more her pencil bids the canvas glow, But yields the envied wreath to Reynolds' brow; Damp'd is the bold Historian's generous fire, Numb'd the free hand, and mute the living lyre. Yet her's the boast with skilful touch to bring The sweetest sounds from Music's trembling string, To bid full Harmony with swelling note In undulating lays of Rapture float, The liquid strains of melody prolong, And lap the soul in extasy of song. Iberia's sons, of yore who foremost strove In the bright lists of Valor and of Love, Who caught in early time each softer grace From their brave victors of the Moorish race, (No more to Emulation's call awake,) The paths of Glory and of Art forsake.— What time Columbus taught them to explore The treasur'd wonders of the Atlantic shore, Gold, all corrupting gold with fatal charm Entranced the bosom, and unnerv'd the arm, And lazy Avarice every wish confines To the rich produce of the Indian mines. While Bigotry, whose blast no power survives, Thro' the waste realms with furious whirlwind drives, And bids them Heaven's avenging Justice feel For fell Pizarro's flames, and Cortez' murderous steel. In Belgia o'er a people's prostrate heads Her universal reign where Commerce spreads, The thirst of gain absorbs all other care, And few the votaries of Refinement there. While in Germania endless forms conspire To damp the ingenuous glow of native fire, The Herald's blazon, and the Noble's pride, The different ranks so rigidly divide, That deepest Science, and exalted worth Can ne'er o'erleap the casual bar of Birth. Besides such empty claims the thoughts employ, So clog the free exchange of social joy, Such serious trifles so engage the taste, Such dire effects attend a name misplaced, That far the gentler Graces wing their flight, Nor bear the drudgery to grow polite. Yet the strong marks of characters like these Fade every hour and vanish by degrees.— Those numerous causes that with different force Have biass'd, or oppos'd, Refinement's course, Have dimm'd her radiant beams with sullen gloom, Or veil'd the lustre of her native bloom, With daily lapse their weaken'd influence lose, One general form as Gallia's arts diffuse, What Prejudice destroy'd, or Error stain'd, By imitative Zeal is now regain'd, And Europe's changing race with common care Affect her manners, and assume her air. Piercing the midnight gloom of Northern skies At length in Russian climes the Arts arise: Already by a patriot Monarch sought, Had Industry each rougher Science taught, And now those joys that graver toil beguile, The favoring warmth confess of Catherine's smile. O glorious Princess! lo the sorrowing Muse Thy great designs with anxious look pursues! For as she frequent bends her weeping eye To scenes on Europe's utmost bound that lie, And sees pale Tyranny's oppressive throne Triumphant rear'd o'er regions once her own, A gleam of hope awhile her anguish charms Drawn from thy generous aims, and conquering arms: She views in Fancy's dream thy Victor host Drive the grim Despot from the Grecian coast, Sees European Freedom bless the shore, And Science grace her favorite seats once more. Asia's wide realms, on whose propitious earth First teeming Genius gave Refinement birth, Lie the sad objects of barbarian sway, To tyrants fierce, and fiercer lusts a prey. For on her eastern plain's extremest verge Her early claims though distant China urge, Though Arts which Europe saw of late unfold Inform'd she boasts her wiser chiefs of old; Yet as her jealous sons have never join'd The common intercourse of human kind, To each fond tale the traveller displays A doubtful credit wavering Reason pays, And Learning fears the incurious race to own, Of all unknowing, and by all unknown. What else exists beneath the cope of heaven Is to the savage tribe of wanderers given, Who unrestrain'd by precept or by law, From climate, and from soil, their difference draw. The sable African no culture boasts, Fierce as his sun, and ruthless as his coasts; And where the immeasurable forests spread Beyond the extent of Ocean's western bed, Unsocial, uninform'd, the tawney race Range the drear wild, and urge the incessant chace. Amid the wide expanse of southern seas Where the blest isles inhale the genial breeze, The happier native in the fragrant grove Woos the soft powers of Indolence and Love: But where more keen the ray, more rude the gale, Manners less mild and harsher cares prevail; Till in the sad extremes of polar frost, The sacred beam of human reason lost, Man scarcely rises from the shaggy brood That prowl insatiate o'er the icy flood. Dire were the scene!—but Europe's gentler kind, Tempting the billowy deep and fickle wind, With venturous prows each distant seat explore, And boldly tread the inhospitable shore; Tame the wild waste, correct the unwholesome air, And fix of polish'd life the empire there. On Afric's southmost point their happy toil Bids gay Pomona clothe the sultry soil, Their power on Asia's eastern coast commands, And Ganges flows by European lands: In the vast tracts beyond the Atlantic main Their Arts, their Science, and their Manners reign, Where rising Glory soars with pinion young, And imitates the parent whence she sprung: While, (civil Discord's bloody storm o'erblown,) Albion, her brave descendants proud to own, ‘Lo these my sons!’ exulting shall exclaim, ‘Who caught from me immortal Freedom's flame, ‘And firmly zealous in the holy cause, ‘Extend o'er half the globe Britannia's laws.’ May Europe's race the generous toil pursue, And Truth's broad mirror spread to every view; Awake to Reason's voice the savage mind, Check Error's force, and civilize mankind; Faith's radiant beam impart to farthest climes, And teach pure Wisdom undebas'd by crimes; To the free breeze the swelling sail unfold Impell'd by Virtue, not allur'd by Gold. No more with arms the trembling tribes destroy, But soft Persuasion's gentler Powers employ, Till, from her throne barbarian Rudeness hurl'd, Refinement spread her Empire o'er the world. PART III.

Thus far with cautious Pencil have I traced The striking forms on History's tablet placed. Harder the task on Truth's unblemish'd page To sketch the living features of the age, Each transient character with care define, And catch the fleeting shape with ready line; Contrast the Manners modern times display With the Refinements of an earlier day; Remark what each from chance, or custom, draws, And seek with curious eye the latent cause; Shew Virtue's sinking worth, or kindling flame, And give impartial praise, or candid blame. In Rome, while Rome's meridian power was graced With the bright æra of Augustan taste, Tho' Art's skill'd votaries reach'd their utmost goal, Though social pleasure sooth'd the liberal soul, Yet rude the joys, and coarse the manners shew, To those which Europe's modern nations know, Where sweet Benevolence the expression warms, Dwells on the tongue, and every accent forms. Nor is the exterior semblance bright alone, A specious veil o'er selfish passion thrown; The gentle bosom real kindness feels, And o'er the soften'd mind Affection steals; Pity and Horror watch o'er human life, And Murder trembling drops his fatal knife. Even War, terrific War! has learn'd to wear A milder garb, and features less severe: The fury of the doubtful conflict o'er, Though gorged with death, and red with streaming gore, The valiant captive meets attentive care, And vanquish'd foes fraternal kindness share; Humanity still meek and prompt to save, Heals every wound the bleeding combat gave, Bids the worst horrors of the battle cease, And lends Bellona half the charms of peace. Politeness too it's nicest skill employs, And gives the last fine touch to human joys, Sweetly combines with unaffected ease The care to aid us, and the wish to please. Far from that pertness whose capricious fit Deems satire freedom, and ill manners wit, Mistakes fastidious pride for judgment chaste, And thinks that censure shews superior taste: Far from that fulsome flattery Dulness pays Who servile adulation takes for praise, The eye on every latent foible draws, And gives an insult where she means applause. And far, O far! from that insidious aim Which screens Deceit beneath Refinement's name, The selfish smile, the promise insincere, And all the rules of Fashion's favorite peer. But that smooth polish, elegant and bright, Which placing merit in the fairest light, By soft compliance rude ill-temper veils, And half reforms the vices it conceals. Say from what source shall keen enquiry trace These striking characters of gentler grace?— Numerous the varied springs whose powers combin'd Direct and regulate the ductile mind.— First that blest fountain of serene delight, Meek-ey'd Religion's mild unsullied rite, The patient votary's humbled breast imbues With heavenly Charity's ambrosial dews, In vain the Infidel's o'erweening pride Affects her hallow'd dictates to deride, Exalts the wisdom of the ancient school, And boasts of moral Virtue's rigid rule; By Christian Faith the perfect doctrines taught Shall mock Philosophy's sublimest thought, In the clear beams of Truth celestial shine, And speak their Holy Teacher all divine. Thence even the stubborn Sceptic mildness draws, And feels their influence though he scorn their laws. The sacred rights of human Nature known, From Europe's climes has exil'd Slavery flown, Who saw of old her sable wing display A gloomy shade o'er Freedom's brightest day.— O could my verse forget she still defiles The sunny regions of the Atlantic isles! Still dwells amidst the hardier race that try In fields of blood for British Liberty! There the sad Libyan bought in shameful trade, Vanquish'd by foes, or by his chiefs betray'd, Waits from his cruel lord's remorseless breath The doom of labor, insult, stripes, and death. Were such the fatal gifts from home ye brought Such the dire lessons Parent Europe taught?— Ah no!—beneath her inimical skies Blasted at once the venom'd monster dies. Bold Chivalry employ'd her earliest care To sooth the rugged brow of frowning War, Valor's fierce form by Courtesy refin'd, And bent to Mercy's sway the headstrong mind. She taught her gallant votaries to forego Each mean advantage o'er a prostrate foe, And shew'd her pupils rear'd in Error's gloom, To shame the polish'd chiefs of Greece and Rome. Crown'd by success, and deck'd in impious pride, See in stern pomp the imperious Consul ride, With each sad victim of uncertain war Dragg'd in remorseless triumph at his car. While Kings and Chiefs superior insult know, And only feel pre-eminence in woe. O had of Gothic days the rudest knight Seen these barbarians, falsely deem'd polite, Shout as the wretched Hero pass'd along, Scorn'd and affronted by the unfeeling throng, How had he turn'd aside the indignant eye As the dire pageant mov'd exulting by, To curse the hearts that selfish maxims steel, And execrate the effects of patriot zeal.— Now view on nearer Poitier's trophied plain The gentler triumphs of Britannia's train! Though every taunt swol'n Insolence could give Warm in the Victor's glowing breast must live, Yet when aloft o'er England's valiant few With unexpected pinion Conquest flew, And Gaul's pale Genius sunk her flagging wing, And mourn'd her slaughter'd Peers and captive King; No keen resentment edg'd the British sword, No biting insult barb'd one cruel word, But godlike Edward mild in fortune's hour Sooth'd the sad Monarch fall'n from regal power, To vanquish'd greatness generous homage paid And serv'd the prisoner that his sword had made. Even those destructive tubes whose fiery breath Spreads wide the scenes of carnage and of death, Though their dread roar the novice ear affright, Aid mercy's power and humanize the fight. Unseen each blow, no warrior treads the plain Demanding vengeance for a brother slain, No favorite kill'd awakes Pelides' hate, No spoils of Pallas urge a Turnus' fate, From hands unknown the mortal stroke is given, And every bullet seems a bolt from Heaven. Yet, to the chiefs of elder time unknown, Punctilious rage from feudal Honor grown Provokes for spleenful wrongs the deadly strife, And claims in private war the forfeit life.— But though too plainly from this dreadful cause Society a milder aspect draws, And practis'd in the School of Fear, or Shame, Fools grow polite, and Savages are tame; Let not the applauding Muse provoke to chide The weeping Orphan, or the widow'd Bride, Awake the trembling Matron's anxious fears, Or ope the sacred source of Beauty's tears. No!—let us turn from fields of death the view, And the calm scenes of softer Peace pursue. Their placid sway the gentler sex impart, Refine the manners, and improve the heart, From the harsh breast each sterner thought remove, And tune the yielding soul to joy and love. No barbarous Jealousy's misjudging care Severely watches o'er the imprison'd Fair, No houshold Tyrant fixes Beauty's doom, To ply the incessant web and servile loom, Nor does the mind allur'd by Plato's dream, Verging to Folly's opposite extreme, It's bosom's Queen in hues ethereal paint And deem the blooming maid the impassive saint. Daughters of Love! they shine with native power, And bless the lone, and grace the social hour, With spotless truth, and ardent passion, blend The enchanting mistress, and the faithful friend, Each fonder joy that lessens grief dispense, Convince the reason and delight the sense. With bashful coyness temper fierce desire, And lead by virtue while by charms they fire. The potent force of such resistless sway Inspires the Muse, and governs every lay; The tender Bard exerts his utmost skill, And all our strains pathetic warblings fill. The Drama lays her awful robe aside Of gloomy horror, and terrific pride, Content alone the gentle mind to move With the sad story of distressful love.— Delightful Art!—though first in shapeless guise Reviving Genius saw thy form arise, When the rude bigot on the barbarous stage Produc'd the mysteries of the holy page; Soon Avon's towering eagle bore thy name Beyond the exalted flights of Attic fame. Though nicer skill succeeding times demand, Though now correctness prune with cautious hand, With scorn tho' Gallia view the Gothic school, Attentive to adopt each ancient rule, While the deep pathos, and the bold sublime, Escape her dull harangues, and duller rhyme. Not all her precepts form'd by critic care Shewn in the flowing numbers of Voltaire, Not even the Grecian Muse, who stalks a Queen With solemn footstep o'er the crouded scene, And by her numerous Choir attended, sings The splendid fate of magistrates and kings, Shall with our Shakespear vie, whose every thought Drawn from sensation, and by Nature taught, Defies the slavish rules of scenic art, And speaks at once conviction to the heart. Yet now his track no daring bard pursues, No more the stage is trod by History's Muse; No Tyrants there the pangs of conscience own, No Furies haunt the Usurper on his throne; With softer anguish Tragedy prevails, And deeds of horror yield to plaintive tales, While full the sympathetic currents flow At each affecting scene of humbler woe. Even Comedy who us'd with jocund grace To dress in chearful smiles the applauding face, Oft quits the playful scourge of ridicule, Spares the pert coxcomb, and the pompous fool, The winning form of gentle pity wears, And unsuspected cheats us into tears. And see in amorous style the Novel dress'd With sentimental sorrow melts the breast, Swells the fair bosom with the heaving sigh, And fills with drops of grief the virgin's eye. Perhaps too far the enchanting lore imparts It's keen sensations to unguarded hearts; The tender scenes by Vice though oft design'd So rivet to the page the attentive mind, So oft with glowing tales of Passion sooth The unexperienced ear of female youth, That many a Maid rapp'd by their magic power Steals from her custom'd rest the midnight hour, To trace through lengthen'd tomes of grief display'd The monstrous shapes by Folly's hand portray'd; Whence the perverted Fancy learns to lose The sweet attractions of the chaster Muse.— Awake to each fictitious feeling grown, And mov'd by ills to real life unknown, The mind, with scenes of fabled woe possess'd, Will shut to homely grief the senseless breast, And turn from Want and Pain the offended ear, To pour for feign'd distress the barren tear. Wide too her wave has swelling Knowledge spread, And the full stream surrounding Nations fed. With unremitting care the sage of old Each maze of Science labor'd to unfold, Hung o'er the tedious page with aching sight Toil'd through the day, and watch'd the wintry night: But teeming presses now around diffuse The monthly magazine and daily news, Where bards on bards in endless train succeed, And all pretend to judge, who know to read. Whate'er pursuits the attentive mind employ Must mark our manners with a strong alloy. Gaming a feature of the human frame In various states and various climes the same, Can the warm'd breast with strong sensation strike, And rude and courtly bosoms charm alike. For this old Rome's luxurious youth would slight ? Nescit equo rudis Hærere ingenuus Puer; Venarique timet, ludere doctior Seu Græco jubeas trocho, Seu malis vetita legibus alea. Hor. Od. 24. Lib. 3. The healthful labor, and the sportive fight; For this among the extended woods that spread Where the blue German hid his restless head Aleam (quod mirere) sobrii inter seria exercent, tanta lucrandi perdendive temeritate, ut quum omnia defecerunt, extremo ac novissimo jactu de libertate et de corpore contendant. Tacitus de Morib. Germ., The rugged inmates won by lust of play Dear life, and dearer freedom gave away: Even in the dusky tribes by Nature placed Mid the lone horrors of the Atlantic waste, Where scarce the claim of property obtains, In savage fury dreadful, Gaming reigns. Hence though the sons of wealth in this delight Now waste with wakeful toil the livelong night, Though on one stake will ample fortunes lie, And mortgaged manors wait a single die; Yet here no form peculiar can we trace No striking character of modern race. But Cards by dull invention first design'd To sooth a frantic Monarch's listless mind Cards are said to have been invented in the year 1390, to divert the melancholy of Charles VI. of France., O'er Europe now extend their strong controul, And almost seem to fascinate the soul: Of every calling, and of every state, The grave, the gay, the humble, and the great, Save the hard sons of wretched labor, fed By daily drudgery, with daily bread, How few but give to this unmeaning play Three tedious hours from every circling day! Nor let the serious Muse though light they seem, Beneath her solemn care such trifles deem; Weak masters though they be, their potent art Gives a strong tincture to the human heart: As the fang'd brood hot Libya's sands among Though by fierce rage or maddening hunger stung, If the clear stream their form reflected shew, Loose all their vengeance on the shadowy foe; So here those powers by Reason unrepress'd Whose furious whirlwinds shook the human breast, Bade with deep wounds contending nations bleed, And urg'd the daring, or the atrocious deed, In trifling cares their idle force engage, And waste on mimic forms their harmless rage.— Yet let not Fashion's modern votaries boast Of harsher manners through their influence lost: If life's severer evils they subdue, And smooth the rugged mind, they weaken too; If savage Hate they quell, and wild Desire, They damp the Poet's, and the Patriot's fire, The fervid glow of Friendship's flame remove, And almost quench the golden lamp of Love. Her magic powers as pleasure thus combines, Each bosom softens and each care refines, Still sure the scenes of opulence to share, Spreads Luxury her splendid empire there; On Europe's lap is pour'd the varied store Of every climate, and of every shore. For her Arabia gives her rich perfume, And labors for her eye the Persian loom; For her the Indian culls with fainting toil The spicy harvests of his sultry soil; In her cool air remov'd from Asian fields It's luscious juice the ripe Anana yields; And Industry with busy care supplies The want of glowing lands, and sultry skies, While all the fruits that Summer heats afford, With blush untimely deck December's board; Spring throws her mantle o'er the freezing hours, And hoary Winter binds his brow with flowers. The swelling sail in climes remote unfurl'd, Wafts home the produce of another world. No more the bark steer'd by the starry ray, With prow uncertain plows the watery way; But guided by that Gem whose mystic power To Arctic regions points in every hour, Commerce new oceans ventures to explore, And launches boldly from the lessening shore, Dares the dread wonders of the deep unfold, And toils at once for glory and for gold. But does not Reason's faithful mirror shew The future prospect of distress and woe, And point what dangers modern softness wait In the sad tale of Rome's declining state?— Far yet such fears!—unnumber'd checks there lie To stop the fatal flight of Luxury. First, a less dangerous form it's power receives From the strong influence Beauty's empire gives. Of culinary skill the enormous waste Offends with dull disgust her nicer taste; Grandeur must art as well as wealth display, And appetite to elegance give way. Foul Gluttony, his beastly empire o'er, Now snuffs the bleeding Hecatomb no more; The rosy silk, and glittering gem, adorn No rich tiara by the tyrant worn; The flowing muslin in resplendent folds No bloated son of selfish passion holds; A nobler end the gifts of Commerce share, And deck with heighten'd charms the lovely fair; The snowy lawn's transparent web displays The panting bosom to the enamor'd gaze; For them the loom it's dædal labor plies, For them the gems disclose their various dies, Rival their glowing cheeks, and emulate their eyes. Even tho' their smiles the stubborn bosom tame, They kindle martial valor's generous flame: Europe of old her free-born daughters gave To Virtue's champion, not to Passion's slave, Not only Love's sweet raptures to dispense, And sooth with wanton blandishment the sense, But the rough scenes of changeful life to share, Double each joy, and lighten every care, While he their choice who fiercest waged the fight, For Beauty ever graced the boldest knight: And still amid Refinement's softest reign The glorious wish their gentle breasts retain. No lazy Sybarite with wily art By female manners wins the female heart, But through the studied garb and air refin'd, Must beam the symptoms of the manly mind, For warlike fame their sure attention draws, And the brave soldier gains their first applause. Contending Nations too with jealous pride, And different interest, Europe's shores divide; Each state, like Greece of old in Freedom's hour, With greater strength boasts independent power, And fierce Ambition by incessant storms In valor's rigid school the hero forms. Hence though it's sweet allurements Wealth display, Though Pleasure wide extend her silken sway, Still Europe may her manly sons behold, Firm though luxurious, and though gentle bold; The polish'd noble feels the generous fires And dauntless courage of his feudal sires, Her rule severe imperious Honor brings, And checks the power of arbitrary kings. Does Honor call?—unsheath'd the avenging sword Mocks the stern mandate of the regal lord. Does martial Honor point to bold renown?— From sumptuous banquets, and from beds of down, Elate and gay the pamper'd warrior flies To fatal climates, and ungenial skies; The extremes of heat and cold unshelter'd braves, And tempts the furious strife of winds and waves; Sees all around him crouding legions fall Pierced by the gleaming steel, or distant ball, Unmov'd receives the cannon's thundering breath, And meets with breast unarm'd the shafts of death. Ah Britain! while with radiance all divine On thee the unsullied rays of Freedom shine! While thy bold sons with steady eye pervade Each form by ancient error sacred made, The haughty noble's titled boast deride, And treat with scorn hereditary pride, Despise fantastic Honor's shadowy name, Till Sense and Reason ratify her claim, Dread in my bosom even those Virtues raise, Anxious I view and tremble while I praise. Though Rank in other climes may chance to tread Insulting o'er indignant Merit's head, Yet curb'd it's visionary fetters hold The aspiring Slave of plunder, and of gold. Custom will oft where Prudence yields, prevail, And Prejudice may save if Wisdom fail: Should e'er Corruption's dark insidious wave Sap the firm barriers ancient Freedom gave; Should Patriot Glory fly the ill-fated land, And sordid Wealth the sole distinction stand, What could repel with salutary force Increasing Luxury's unbridled course? Thy recreant sons may then lament too late The happier errors of each neighbouring state; And Virtue's pure ethereal substance fled, Wish Honor's fainter semblance in it's stead. Though Commerce wide her general blessings shower When moderation bounds her restless power, Though on our shores she spread with liberal hand The fair productions of each distant land, And richer harvests from our cultur'd fields Rough Industry by her encourag'd yields, Feeds both the toiling hive, and lazy drones, The Hind that labors, and the Lord that owns; Yet when forsaking every manlier thought, Each firm resource with native vigor fraught, A feeble state with abject hope relies But on the uncertain aid her force supplies; From imposts laid on vice subsistence draws, And lavish waste encourages by laws; Disdains each nobler call that charm'd of old, And rates perfection by the test of gold, Soon shall corruption with unbounded tide In sweeping fury o'er the region ride; While crouding woes the wretched empire wait That strove by bloated weakness to be great, Gave her own strength and inborn worth away For the faint phantom of commercial sway; Proud to extend a vast precarious reign On Folly founded, and which Crimes maintain. Sure, or the scene a gloomy aspect wears View'd through the medium of prophetic fears, Or now, even now, the sad contagion spreads, And dire effects on British manners sheds. The race who draw their worth from wealth alone, Nor other rank, nor other merit own, In high esteem by abject flattery placed, Debase our morals, and corrupt our taste: The dread infection flies from sire to son, And Folly dissipates what Avarice won; Expence the place of elegance supplies, And half demolish'd Beauty's empire lies. The breast that Education never form'd Bright Science train'd, or sportive Fancy warm'd, Knows not with mirth unting'd by scorn to please. Be gay with dignity, and grave with ease, But vents the jest uncouth with coarse delight, And deems unmanner'd insolence polite. While the rude vulgar glad to draw disgrace On the invidious claims of birth, and place, Applaud the glare by lavish Ignorance shewn, And give distinctions chance may make their own. Ye ancient Lords of Britain's fair domain! 'Tis yours to vindicate Refinement's reign; Though Wisdom's eye disdain the titled slave Staining the Honors which his fathers gave, Yet with a brighter hue shall Virtues shine That add new lustre to a noble line.— Say is the pride of birth concentred all In the old trophy and the banner'd hall?— Yours be the fairer boast in docile youth To catch from Learning's voice the lore of Truth, Drink the pure reasonings of the patriot sage, And cull each flower that decks the classic page, Till by the fame of godlike heroes fir'd, The man shall copy what the boy admir'd. If leaving these superior aims ye try In every vice with every fool to vie, Each fair advantage fortune gives forego To wage unequal conflict with the foe, Say can the gazing croud be justly blam'd Who pay to Wealth the deference Honor claim'd, When sickly folly taints that generous worth Which heighten'd grandeur and ennobled birth? Your happier purpose be it to restore The fame that waited Britain's Lords of yore, Ere true Nobility's unblemish'd shape Was chang'd for manners every knave can ape. Yours be it Freedom's empire to support No Faction's slaves, no flatterers of a Court. Watch with keen eye the encroachments of the throne, But guard it's rights for they protect your own. Fly not, discharg'd each due of public care, To breathe soft Dissipation's summer air, Where Pleasure's hand prepares the poppied draught, To drown reflection, and to deaden thought. No, rather joy the shouting train to meet Who hail the lord of each paternal seat; Where your wide forests spread parental shade View the gay scenes of rural taste display'd; Let Hospitality's warm hand await To court the stranger to the friendly gate; Enforce with steady zeal your Country's laws, To Justice true, and firm in Virtue's cause; Curb Vice licentious in her mad career, And teach oppressive Arrogance to fear; Redress when injur'd Merit heaves the sigh, And wipe the tear from pale Affliction's eye: So shall your fame with purer honor live Than wealth, than faction, or than rank can give, While these best titles on each name attend, The bad man's terror, and the poor man's friend. Long may ye mock in this secure defence The vain attempts of wealthy Insolence: No more shall sense by rudeness be debas'd, Or Fortune's lavish minions vitiate taste; Her stores profuse no more shall Commerce fling, But brood o'er Industry with fostering wing; While your examples teach her wiser train To use with prudence, what by care they gain. And you ye fair! forgive the honest lay That even your slightest errors dares display, Nor think satiric rage my arm can move To wound like Diomed the Queen of Love, Though I presume to point the fated hour, Mark'd with the symptoms of your fading power, And mourn that all those arts which life refine, Rais'd by your sway, shall with your sway decline. Oft by the youth neglected now ye stand Nor meet Attention's fond assiduous hand: O be it yours to check with just disdain; This mark of selfish Luxury's domain, Ah! leave that thirst of riot's endless joy Whose constant round your empire must destroy: Beauties from scene to scene that restless fly Lose all their force, and sate the public eye; The midnight revel early age o'ertakes, And the wan cheek the native rose forsakes; Light Affectation too intent to please Disfigures more than time or pale disease; And tyrant Fashion with Procrustes' arm Shapes to it's wild caprice each tortur'd charm. For Love's! for Virtue's sake! ah lay aside The undaunted forehead, and the martial stride! Again the garb of female softness wear, And quit the fierceness of the Grenadier: For can the ornaments your cares combine When all the toilet's rich materials shine, Match blushing Modesty's transparent red O'er the warm cheek in sweet suffusion spread, Or like the downcast eye's mild lustre move, Whose lid veils Meekness and whose glance is Love? In fabled times by Ida's lofty wood, When rival Goddesses contending stood, Though Juno conscious of her awful mien March'd with the state of Jove's imperious Queen, Though Pallas deck'd her Amazonian charms In the refulgent glare of radiant arms, Yet Love prevail'd in Cytherea's eyes, And smiling Beauty gain'd the golden prize. From Albion far may heaven's benign decrees Avert the storms my anxious mind foresees: Still may she shine with pure Refinement's grace Secure on Virtue's adamantine base; Prosperous awhile though private Vice may stand, No miracle can save a vicious land; In life's calm paths though fortune oft dispense Success to Guilt, and pain to Innocence. Whence Faith with strengthen'd eye beyond the tomb Sees the dread hour of Justice yet to come, On public crimes must early vengeance wait, And speedy ruin wrap an impious state, Since from the offence the sure correction springs,— And her own scourge abandon'd Folly brings. But let not man attempt with bounded skill To search the depths of Heaven's eternal will, Inspect the rolls of fate with fruitless care, And read the future doom of empires there. Enough, her eye as cool Reflection throws O'er all the scenes these lengthen'd lays disclose, To mark each prospect as they move along, And draw these moral maxims from the song: That though Refinement know with temperate ray To wake each bloom of Merit into day, Urg'd to excess her heighten'd powers destroy The expanding bud, and blast each promis'd joy, As storms and sultry gleams o'ercome the flower Rais'd by the genial sun, and gentle shower. That Education, while her careful art Clears from each baneful Prejudice the heart Must cherish inborn Glory's generous aim, The source of rising Worth, and future Fame. That above all, on each ingenuous breast Be with strong force this sacred Truth impress'd; No polish'd Manners rival Virtue's price, No savage Ignorance disgusts like Vice. Sent with the Second Edition of the Poem to his Majesty the King of PRUSSIA. Imperial Bard! if while my humble strain Thy precepts sung to Albion's warlike train, Her critic ear approving caught the sound, And favoring smiles my finish'd labor crown'd, Her plaudits to thy glowing verse belong But faintly imaged in my ruder song. Then as the Muse to thee assiduous pays This honest tribute of Britannia's praise, Though Fame has cull'd from Phœbus' sacred tree The Poet's and the Victor's wreath for thee, And History shall twine around thy brow Eternal crowns of her unfading bough, Forgive the officious zeal that interweaves This transient blossom with thy Laurel Leaves. HENRY JAMES PYE. THE ART OF WAR. A POEM, IN SIX BOOKS. TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH OF THE KING OF PRUSSIA. ? MARES ANIMOS IN MARTIA BELLA VERSIBUS EXACUIT ? HORACE. TO THE HONORABLE WILLIAM KEPPEL, LIEUTENANT-GENERAL OF HIS MAJESTY'S FORCES, THIS POEM, TRANSLATED BY AN OFFICER AT HIS LEISURE HOURS, WHILE ENCAMPED UNDER HIS COMMAND AT COXHEATH, IN THE YEAR ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-EIGHT, IS, WITH THE GREATEST RESPECT, ESTEEM, AND REGARD, DEDICATED. BOOK I. Illustrious Prince mark'd out by partial Fate To bear the burthen, and the pomp of state, To reign of spacious realms the future lord, To lift the balance, and to wield the sword, O hear a Soldier train'd to War's alarms, Inur'd to danger, and grown old in arms, With voice experienced shew the thorny road Which leads through scenes of blood to Fame's abode. Nor arms, nor steeds, nor numerous troops, alone Sustain the honor of the monarch's throne; Their use acquire, and every Art that leads The Warrior's skilful arm to glorious deeds; My Muse shall here the various portrait trace, And point the virtues which the Hero grace; His talents gain'd by toil, his mind serene, His active courage, and his foresight keen, Whose powers united in the Warrior's heart O'erleap the bounded limits of his art. Yet think me not, malignant bard, inclin'd To sound pale Discord's clarion to mankind, That dazzled by false Glory's dangerous fire I seek Ambition's fury to inspire, Or wish to see your savage vengeance, hurl'd With frantic boldness o'er a ravag'd world; O may my Hero boast the honest fame That waits Aurelius', Titus', Trajan's name; Then shine with noblest light triumphant kings, When Virtue owns the crown that Valor brings, Droops every trophy, withers every wreath, That fell Injustice blasts with poisonous breath! O lovely Peace! and thou thrice happy power, Whose hands on Prussia's realm each blessing shower, Far from our fields and tranquil seats, be driven A Victor King, the heaviest scourge of Heaven! Could my low voice reach Heaven's eternal throne, Still should our fields thy blissful influence own, Still should the labourer in our happy plains Securely reap the produce of his pains, And watchful Themis with impartial law Protect the guiltless, and the vicious awe, Our vessels give their canvas to the breeze, And fear no dangers but from stormy feas, And Pallas o'er our peaceful throne preside, Her ægis guard us, and her wisdom guide; But should some neighbouring power with causeless hate Disturb our quiet, and invade the state, Ye kings! ye people! rouse to War's alarms, And Heaven shall aid their cause whom Justice arms. Fierce God of War! to thee I tune the lay, Direct my steps, and point the arduous way, And you, Aonian maids, assist my choice, To gentle accents melt my rougher voice, Temper with softer strains my warlike fire, And tune my trumpet to your peaceful lyre! My daring mind would paths unusual trace, And on Parnassus' heights Victoria place, While on the forehead of the Delian god, Shall gleam the helmet, and the plumage nod. My hand nor paints fair Venus' amorous wiles, Her wanton blushes, and her witching smiles, Nor shews the hero's limbs inglorious laid On fragrant roses 'neath the myrtle's shade; Let Pontus' bard sing Cupid's silken sway, While listening Graces love the tender lay, My martial pen more horrid forms designs, Stern Vulcan working 'midst Ætnéan mines, Where ponderous blows with dreadful art prepare Those fell machines, the Thunderbolts of War, Whose force, when skilful hands their power employ, O'erturn the bulwark, and the town destroy, Drive fighting legions to the realms of death, And rule the fate of empires with their breath. I'll paint the cruel arm from Bayonne nam'd, Where savage art a new destruction fram'd, Their powers combin'd where fire and steel impart, And point a double wound at every heart. Amidst the ranks, while death and carnage reign, Calm moves the hero o'er the crimson plain, Commands fresh troops the dubious fight to wage, And shews the fatal tempest where to rage. But ere I open to the youthful heart These parts sublime, the mysteries of the art, First shall my precepts to the pupil's sight Unfold the easier maxims of the fight: So, ere the eaglets try the realms of air, The parent's wings her callow offspring bear, Till bold by use, aloft they proudly rise, And sail with dauntless pinion through the skies. Ye warrior youths, impatient now to tread The dangerous path of Fate, by Honor led! Torn from a weeping mother's folding arms, Untried in Fight, and new to War's alarms, Think not with novice hand to seize renown, Or pluck from Victory's brow th' eternal crown; Disdain not first to learn with ceaseless care, Each nice detail, the Elements of War; To forms of art your docile bodies yield, With ready arm the weighty firelock wield; Firm in your ranks in death-like silence stand, And wait with watchful eye your chief's command; Quick at the word, in equal motions all, Place in the threatening tube the murderous ball; With steady footsteps wedg'd in close array, Your ranks unfloating, rapid rush away; Now halting, to the allotted time attend, While by platoons unnumber'd deaths you send; Calmly, though swift, (false haste will still retard,) March to the post your duty bids you guard, Attend each signal of your leader's hand, Who knows not to obey will ne'er command; With courage thus 'neath valiant Baden's care, Pass'd Finck the hard apprenticeship of War. When train'd for fight the embattled cohorts stand, The meanest soldier helps to form the band; These are the limbs, and Discipline the soul Pervades, informs, and regulates the whole. So that Versailles her silver streams may play In watry columns to the face of day, Marly's strong engines fram'd by nicest skill, Make Seine's subjected waves obey their will; Ten thousand various wheels, and pumps unseen, With blended powers compose the vast machine, Each movement to the whole assistance lends, Cord waits on cord, and wheel on wheel depends, Fail but one rope, one pulley move no more, The frame's disorder'd, and the scene is o'er. Thus in the host which glory leads to fame, Should docile courage every breast inflame; Valor that leaps o'er order's sacred bound Is often dangerous, always useless found, Movements uncertain, rashly quick, or slow, May blast the laurels budding on your brow. Deem not the nice details of duty vain, They're the first steps that lead to Victory's fane; By service taught, and train'd in valor's school, Soldier yourself, you'll soldiers learn to rule; Form'd by degrees by Wisdom's careful hand The prudent leader of a valiant band, Your steady thoughts will o'er it's ranks preside, It's daring march with temper'd ardor guide, Teach it the various forms of fight to know, And send unerring slaughter on the foe. Rang'd in three ranks fair Prussia's hardy race With dauntless front the adverse legions face; With deeper files their foes, though brave, in vain Oppose their ardor, and dispute the plain. Advance with equal pace the close-wedg'd line, Let in the front the dreadful bayonet shine, Attack with ardor, and reserve your fire, So shall the astonish'd foe at once retire. Your wasted troops must be supplied with care, Mown down by slaughter in the field of War; Chuse manly youths with sinews firm and strong To share the glories of your veteran throng: Mars loves the swain whose well-knit limbs can take The heaviest burthens, nor his ranks forsake, While feebler frames, by labor worn, and pain, Shall sink beneath the weight of one campaign. So proudly waving o'er the mountain's brow, Braves the tough oak the whirlwinds as they blow, While by it's sturdy side the wintry blast Lays with it's rage the slender pine-tree waste. Thus shall new levies fill your daring train, Strong as the shaggy brood of Libya's plain. If to renown your daring hopes aspire, Of various troops the different use acquire. To arms with which Thessalia's heroes fought, Join what their foes the active Centaurs taught; Let a new Pluvinel An eminent Riding-master. your coursers train, To bear the soldier, and obey the rein, O'er the wide trench with active limbs to bound, To pass the rivulet, and to leap the mound. On your strong beast the weighty cuirass wear, And let your brows the galling helmet bear, Learn with exactest art the sword to wield, For oft rude force to active skill must yield; This ready weapon gleaming in the hand Shall terrify or break the hostile band, Deal with resistless force it's deaths around, While Mars approving smiles on ev'ry wound; But from the snorting steed, the uncertain fire, Breaks your own ranks, nor makes the foe retire. Teach your brave squadrons to perform with care The various forms of fight, and modes of War, To halt at once, to wheel in close array, Nor from their neighbouring troops to break away: Let some experienced chief with careful art, Speed join'd with order, to your line impart; Teach it on every ground with ease to form; Swift as the lightning, dreadful as the storm, Shew it at once from pace sedate and slow, To rush impetuous on the wond'ring foe; To drive the adverse troops to rapid flight, And sweep contending armies from the fight. First bloom'd the laurel bough on Grecia's soil, Stern Sparta taught the Warrior's generous toil, While Thebes the close compacted fight begun, And bade her phalanx glitter in the sun. Illustrious chiefs of Greece! your sage command To heroes rais'd the meanest of your band; Your skill the want of numerous hosts supplied, And temperate Valor vanquish'd Persian Pride, While Marathon and Salamis proclaim To ages yet unborn the Grecian name. Wondering, the Macedonian Prince behold, Proud of his friends, and lavish of his gold, Wealthy in hopes, of warlike Virtue vain, He fights, he conquers Persia's trembling train; Astonish'd Asia shrinks beneath the blow, And yields her riches to the approaching foe, While by Euphrates' stream his phalanx stood, Granicus' waves, and Ganges' distant flood. At length stern Mavors from the eastern shore, To Rome's proud walls his bloody banners bore; A warrior nation frantic for alarms Learn'd from the God himself the use of arms; They dare their martial neighbours to the field, And force opposing destiny to yield; Italia's states their growing power obey, Bend to their mandates, and increase their sway: By deeds like these their eagle used to soar, Now stretch'd her pinions to each distant shore; Rome 'gainst her foes their Arts improving turns, And from each war new means of Victory learns; Her strengthen'd camps all hostile inroads brave, And Danube trembled from his farthest wave. Triumphant thus, her conquering bands subdued Iberia's swains, Germania's hardy brood; The painted sons of Britain's sea-girt shore Lament their savage independence o'er; The Grecian Arts, the Punic Wiles were vain, And Pontus' Chiefs, and Gallia's giant Train, And all a vanquish'd World confess'd her boundless reign. But when that Discipline, whose copious source Supplied their legions with resistless force, Beneath their later Cæsars 'gan to fade, A thousand barbarous hosts their realms invade, More ruffian rage than warrior art employ, Each province ravage, and each town destroy, Till nodding to her fall, the ruin'd state Her ancient laws neglected mourns too late. Now long the glorious Art unheeded lay, Till The Emperor Charles V. Charles victorious call'd it into day: The nations trembling at his warlike reign, Beheld the unconquer'd infantry of Spain Reduced by ceaseless care to order's law, But doom'd to perish in thy fields, Rocroi. Bursting those bands which long her sons had chain'd, Arous'd by vengeance, and by Maurice train'd, Batavia bravely curb'd despotic sway, And freedom gain'd by learning to obey; By this illustrious Chief's example fir'd, The brave Turenne to glory's heights aspir'd; While, patroniz'd by Lewis' prudent view, Gallia from him the Hero's Science drew, And the bold Warrior bow'd his stubborn heart To the strict rules of Discipline and Art. Mean while Eugene, the favorite son of Mars, Form'd for the fight, and doom'd in future wars To stand firm bulwark of the imperial throne, Pass'd in his court unnotic'd and unknown. From him Dessaw, then new to War's alarms, First learn'd the toilsome rudiments of Arms: Thus the same powers on Austria's realms who wait, Became the guardians of the Prussian state. Mark how in every age this Art alone Has fix'd the monarch, and maintain'd his throne; If of this wonderous pile that mates the skies, On Discipline the first foundations rise, Let in your mind it's vast importance live, Which sage experience knows alone to give; Woe to the Novice who with frantic heart Shall think, untaught, to try this dangerous Art. Thus Phaeton, while headstrong passions fire, Obtains the burning chariot from his sire, His hands had ne'er the fiery coursers driven, Nor knew his eyes the devious paths of Heaven; He seiz'd the reins, his horses start away, O'er all the ethereal plains at will they stray, Till struck the impetuous youth by thunder's force, The hissing waves receive his blacken'd corse. Rash youths be warn'd! the dangerous frenzy shun, Nor tempt the timeless fate of Phaeton: A ruin'd land shall mourn his hapless Wars Who guides too soon the fiery steeds of Mars. BOOK II. When fatal Discord from the realms of night, Wings to this bleeding world her baleful flight, Wakes with infernal cries her serpent brood, Sheds through the troubled air a fiery flood, And bids invidious rage and fury dart Their rankling poisons through each monarch's heart, Justice and Peace from mortal councils driven, Forsake the earth, and seek their native Heaven; Remorseless Vengeance every nation guides, And brutal force in Themis' seat presides; Satiate with blood, yet thirsting still for more, Proud of her first success, with savage roar, The monster urges to the dangerous plain Destructive War, and all her hellish train. Then shine around the opening stores of Mars, The ramparts guarded threaten future Wars; On every anvil new-form'd weapons gleam, And loads the darken'd sky a sulphurous steam; The spacious cities, whilom seats of ease, With pleasure gay, and every art of peace, Now swarm with crowding troops and glittering arms, All look destruction, and all breathe alarms, While the shrill clarion chides the winter's stay, Whose tedious hours the promis'd War delay. The season form'd to fan more pleasing fires, Parent of blooming hopes and young desires, When smiling Graces every flower combine, The blooming wreaths of Love and Peace to twine, Tempts only now to scenes of blood and death The daring Warrior urg'd by Glory's breath. Soft floats the air, and pours the melting snow In silver torrents from the mountain's brow; O'er the fair vales the crystal currents glide, And smiling herbage waits on every tide; Verdant with rising corn the hills appear, And laughing Flora decks the vernal year; The warrior bands with vengeful arms supplied, The fatal ministers of regal pride, For glory eager, and of courage proud, With wings of speed to Honor's standard croud; For the warm roof the tent it's covering spreads;— The approaching War each trembling neighbour dreads; The affrighted hind reluctant quits the soil, And strangers reap the produce of his toil. Now on the destin'd spot the martial train Drawn up in dread array possess the plain; The full battalions on the appointed place, With ready hands the growing city trace; Here stretch the streets, and there the palace gate Spreads to receive the guardians of the state; Without or wood, or stone, with skilful hands By soldiers rear'd, the canvas city stands; Who, as the War requires, with ease pull down, Bear off, and raise anew, the moving town. It asks no vulgar mind, or trifling care, To chuse the station and the Camp prepare: Your troops in certain safety would you place, The different ground with skill and prudence trace: Here craggy mountains seem to pierce the sky, There narrow dells and spacious champains lie; Each, as occasion points or chance directs, Assists your purpose, and your Camp protects; On these selected well, and fix'd with care, Depends the fortune of th' approaching War. The hardy troops whose steady march you lead, The substance form of War, yourself the head; Since from your thoughts their ev'ry motion flows, Act while they rest, and watch o'er their repose; To you each look the ardent warriors send, Wait on your words, and on your skill depend; With ceaseless care their confidence retain, Nor let the Soldier trust your power in vain. Does your bold heart in bloody fields delight, Resolv'd to try the dubious chance of fight? Chuse for your daring Camp the extended field, Whose space shall room for every movement yield; Small troops advanc'd before your army send, Let woods, and rivers near, your Post defend: Protect the neighbouring towns with watchful eye, Whose plenteous marts your valiant troops supply; Let your brave bands at equal distance drawn, Rang'd in two lines, divide the verdant lawn; Your foot the centre guard with steady ranks, While your new-form'd dragoons protect the flanks; The infantry with firm resistless force Your body make, your arms the rapid horse. Uncrouded squadrons there their files extend, Active to charge, or ready to defend; But in it's proper place each corps employ, Or ground unfit will all their power destroy. Mounted on fiery steeds, the Centaur train, Who rush like lightning o'er the level plain, Where swells in craggy heights the uneven ground, Or gloomy forests spread, are useless found, While the brave foot in all alike remain, The wood, the marsh, the mountain, or the plain, March o'er the extended field, or hollow dale, Climb the steep cliff, the strong entrenchment scale, Ready with equal vantage to engage, Where'er the doubtful battle chance to rage. As when in spring, the clouds together driven, With scowling vapours blot the face of Heaven, And thunder, wind, and rain, with stormy blast, Lay the green hopes of future harvests waste; So with their heavy fire in close array, They ruin pour on all who check their way. If to your breast her aid discretion lend, Your army's flanks with strictest care defend; A friendly village, an impervious wood, A deep morass, or silver-winding flood, Shall every weaker part from fear protect, And teach the foe such ramparts to respect. The bull provok'd, with horns protended stands, Runs on his foe, and spurns with rage the sands, With ready front each bold attack receives, Nor to the assault his side defenceless leaves. The important precept fix within your heart, The prudent chief conceals each weaker part; Secure from wounds, save in the unguarded heel, The Grecian hero mock'd the force of steel; Such are your flanks, protect them from the foe, Nor rashly tempt like him a mortal blow. By adverse fortune if your schemes are cross'd, While growing numbers swell the opposing host, To your thin ranks let Art her succour lend, Let Nature's works your strengthen'd Camp defend; Place your battalions on the mountain's brow, 'Midst gloomy woods, or where rude torrents flow. Nor this enough; some passage unexplor'd Should from your post a safe retreat afford; Free to retire, or ready to advance, Then shall you scorn the shifting power of chance, O'ercome by talents while your foes remain To waste with useless rage their force in vain. Learn in the field of Mars with prudent care, To range your bands in every form of War; With fire your line sustain, between the space Of different corps, your thundering engines place, Whose brazen wombs with dreadful flash impart Despair and terror to the assailant's heart. Behind these fierce volcanos let your band Of cuirass'd horse in dreadful order stand: If fire and steel their force in vain combine, But still your foes advance and pierce your line, Swift to your eager squadrons give the word, And let them bathe in blood each shining sword. Thus to the experienced leader's sage command It's ready aid affords the docile land, Still offers safety to his eagle sight, And wisdom fixes fortune's transient flight. Valor's a common gift, but Prudence rare, Varro the daring Soldier's praise may share. But the form'd Hero shines in Fabius' care. As where aloft the cliffs of Athos rise, And rush with azure summits to the skies, In vain the embattled tempest pours from far, Against his sides the elemental War, Smiles 'midst an air serene his lofty brow, And mocks the thunder as it roars below; So the cool chief despising fortune's frown, Looks from his well-fenc'd Camp undaunted down, Beholds his foe in useless schemes engage, And waste in vain attempts his fruitless rage. If Genius in your breast has fix'd her throne, And Mars propitious mark'd you for his own, Whatever ground your legions tread, you'll find Castles, and forts, by nature's hand design'd; Folly may see, but Wisdom's happy skill Turns each obedient to the Warrior's will. Thus Sparta's hero in that glorious day, When Xerxes' millions forced at length their way, Oppos'd his scanty troops with daring force, To stop of Persia's sons the unskilful course, And Grecia's arms, in many a conflict tried, Check'd for a while the Median Tyrant's pride. Thus, when the imperial conflict wafting o'er From Italy to pale Epirus' shore, The senate's darling champion rush'd to join The mighty hero of the Julian line; Dyrrachium's mountains well your guarded straits Had turn'd to Pompey's side the doubting fates, For on your heights the chief secure had stood, And worn the victor wreath unsoil'd with blood; But Rome's luxurious youth inflam'd with rage, Of toil impatient, panting to engage, Forced him to quit his post's impervious aid,— The error Mars with tenfold vengeance paid, And for the fault of one unguarded hour, Gave up the vanquish'd world to Cæsar's power. O Montecuculli. thou whose skill could like the Roman's shine! Shield of the empire, guardian of the Rhine! Whose well-fenced Camps could give to fortune law, Command success, and keep Turenne in awe, Say, shall my Muse forget thy glorious name?— Let Mars assist me while I chant thy fame! Ye youthful Warriors, mark the great campaign, Whose conduct guarded fair Germania's plain, Admire each scene, each field with wonder view, Survey his Camps, his rapid march pursue, See his strong posts the fire of Gallia brave, Restrain her ardor, and his country save. Think not his force unmov'd he kept, nor deem Though the large Camp a spacious city seem, That War no sudden change requires, but learn To watch the subtle foe at every turn; With movement quick the former ground forsake, Prevent his march, and each advantage take, Safely retire, advance with rapid course, And still by new attempts employ his force. When to decamp the General gives command, In lengthen'd column moves each separate band, Four different corps they form, the ready horse, On either flank protect the army's course; While in the centre, rang'd in long array, The steady foot pursue their toilsome way: The distant foe who views the warrior train Wind o'er in deepen'd files the spacious plain, As glides the serpent arm'd with glittering scales, In shining volumes o'er the Libyan vales, The dreadful scene surveys with wild affright, While slaughter leads the van, and claims the fight. When form'd for War, your legions cross the plain, Would you the smiles of fierce Bellona gain, Before your front advanced, strong parties send, Sustain their ardor, and their force defend; These like the fiery cloud whose chearing light Through the drear wild conducted Israel's flight, Mid scenes unknown shall guide your watchful eyes, And guard your doubtful march from quick surprize. But should of fatal War the uncertain chance Demand to right, or left, a swift advance, March by your flanks embattled on the plain, While parallel your equal lines remain. To adverse fate must victors sometimes yield, Turenne has fail'd, and Condé lost the field; When forced the day to stronger arms to leave, Still may the subtle chief his foes deceive, Applauding worlds his merit shall admire, Who knows without confusion to retire. First march your baggage off to safeguards near, While a bold train protects the lagging rear, And, while the light-arm'd foot the mountains scale, Secure the heavier forces pass the vale, Till freed from danger of insulting foes, Glorious, yet safe, the harrass'd troops repose. O'er fair Germania's hills, with ceaseless haste, And thorny forests Varus heedless past, His troops neglecting, headstrong, rash, and vain, Marching unform'd, encamping on the plain, Till 'mid rude dells, and craggy mountains lost, Arminius' schemes destroy'd his wilder'd host; Augustus' tears their cruel fate deplore, Varus, he cries, my slaughter'd troops restore!— With wiser counsel, and more helpful care, He should have cried, imprudent chief beware! To seize the mountains heights thy power employ, Nor let a barbarous host my troops destroy. The Art of War which empire's sway extends, On these first principles alone depends; In advantageous posts your Camps prepare, Advance with caution, and retire with care Ye Warrior Chiefs who o'er our troops preside, Learn from my verse your various parts to guide, Let Practice prove what Theory has shewn; And would ye sit on Glory's envied throne, Your Camp like Fabius form, secure and slow, And learn your Marches from his Punic foe. BOOK III. Your footsteps now the arsenals have trod Where lie the treasures of the warrior God; Yet 'midst his ranks to serve is little fame, Little avails the soldier's ardent flame, Unless to all the heights of art you climb, And reach of martial skill the true sublime. Come to his Temple! lo to you reveal'd Each mystic rite from common eyes conceal'd, Far from those paths where creep the vulgar train March boldly on, and seek the inmost fane. Deep sink the threatening gulphs on either side, And the rude path with heroes blood is dy'd, Firm on a crimson rock, with murky cloud Enwrap'd, the palace rears her turrets proud Above the sun amidst the empyreal skies, Sublime her glittering pinacles arise, While her foundations sinking deep, remain On Stygian shores, and Pluto's drear domain. Pale Discord, cruel Death, the Fury band, Who of these seats eternal guardians stand, In vain on you their savage aspects turn, While in your breast the flames of Glory burn, Glory shall ope the sounding portals wide, Conduct your steps, and place you by her side. Beneath the porch enrich'd with burnish'd gold, Tuning their silver lyres the Nine behold: First 'mid their number see Urania stand, The pictur'd globe, and compass in her hand, On whose smooth surface drawn with mimic line, Appear what realms to form the world combine; Through all the extent her skilful fingers trace Each different state, it's order, and it's place; Exact Vauban, and learned Sanson there, The warrior's guides, her favorite sons appear, They point the plains extent, the city's force, The mountain's summit, and the river's course, The strength or weakness of the fort display, And guide through paths unseen the warrior's way. But who is that by Glory's side who sings The various fate of warriors, and of kings? Calliope! the listening youth around Catch from her dulcet breath the enlivening sound, And equal skill the attentive Pupil draws From Error's censure, and from Worth's applause. Morality with form majestic see Keeping the approach from minds presumptuous free, Her voice severe those chiefs alone approves Whom Merit dignifies, and Virtue loves, Bids Cruelty and Avarice fly afar, And teaches pity 'mid the rage of War, Hates Envy's snakes, and crowns with Glory's meed Their brows alone who for their country bleed. Approach! Bellona's armed hands discern On the strong hinge the brazen portal turn, Which from the vulgar eye those mysteries hide, Shewn to the favorite train who grace her side. Deep in the Temple's isle with splendor graced, On a proud throne's majestic purple placed, Which Genius on her spreading pinions bears, In all his pomp the dreadful God appears: Close by his side intrepid Valor stands, And Prudence, calm amidst contending bands, Labor whose wakeful eyelids never close, And Guile who round her looks malignant throws; Who as occasion suits at will appears, And Proteus-like a thousand figures wears; Imagination, in whose eye confess'd Beams the rich fire that animates her breast, Where swift a thousand brilliant projects move, Which wise Minerva's critic rules approve. With downcast looks and deep mysterious mien, Lo! Secresy compleats the mingled scene, With finger on her mouth, and speaking nod, She stalks still trusted by the warrior God. Around the throne eternal laurels blow, Which on those Demi-Gods his hands bestow, Those favorite chiefs whose skill in many a field Has made to Wisdom's efforts Victory yield, Heroic crown! 'tis thy unfading charms Which court alone the illustrious chief to arms, Each selfish passion wings her harpy flight, While thou and Glory charm him to the fight. 'Midst the bright fane which various trophies grace, Mars at his will directs the human race; Between yon brazen columns turn your eyes, And mark the chiefs in sculptur'd order rise, In the cut marble frowns each daring son, On nations trading which his arms had won. Here shine, so oft compar'd, each glorious name Mounting by different steps the heights of fame, With whose renown still rings the earthly ball, This great by Persia's, that by Pompey's fall; Miltiades and Cymon grace the shrine, And Alcibiades thy form divine, Emilius, Quintus, Fabius, Scipio, there Partake the triumph, and the incense share, Villars and Condé, chiefs of newer date, And royal Henry justly nam'd the Great, Gustavus slain while Victory graced his side, And valiant William, Prussia's darling pride, Illustrious Anhalt, Baden, brave Eugene, Montecuculli. Germania's guardian, and his foe Turenne. New from the artist's hand, yon sculptur'd head, The palm fresh blooming o'er his temples spread, The glorious Saxon M. Saxe. see, the boast of France! Reserv'd in peace for Death's insatiate lance! Come beardless youths, Experience sage behold, Long us'd to labor, and in science old, Silver'd with age her hoary head appears, Her body bent beneath the weight of years, Her limbs tho' scarr'd yet mock the strokes of time, Vers'd in the arts of every age and clime Her voice examples to the ear supplies, And speaks of deeds familiar to her eyes. She'll teach you Scipio's ardor to explore, Protecting Rome on Libya's distant shore, Till Carthage calls her veteran troops again, To meet disgrace on Zama's sultry plain; While a less daring chief content to shield From conquering foes Italia's ravag'd field, Successful there, had thank'd propitious fate, And guarded, not reveng'd, the insulted state. Fell Discord while on haughty Rome she frown'd, With meeds of glory many a warrior crown'd, Skill'd to advance with speed, with care retreat, Sertorius see her baffled troops defeat, Amidst Iberia's hills his well-train'd force, Checks Rome's adventurous eagle in her course; So much can Genius by her potent art, Success to arms in spite of chance impart. While a young Chief to rasher steps inclin'd, Leaving the rocks, and sheltering hills behind, Had in their Camp the numerous foe defied, And Pompey dar'd with Fortune by his side. Condé the great, Bellona's favorite son, Of wasted France secur'd the tottering throne; The unhappy times a dauntless stroke require, To check of conquering foes the increasing fire. In one decisive day for France and Spain, Courage prevail'd where Prudence had been vain. While timid measures weakly circumspect Had tried alone the nation to protect, The Spanish chief embolden'd by delay, To proud Lutetia's walls had forced his way. From Northern climes, the eternal winter's reign, See the dread squadron plow our frighted main, Drawn by Germania's wrongs, the navy brings The brave Gustavus, and the fate of kings; To him their cause the realms oppress'd confide, Mars leads his steps, and Pallas guards his side, His threatening brows on Austria's Tyrant lower, Resolv'd to curb Vienna's growing power, While Stralsund's friendly ramparts still afford A ready harbour to their daring Lord: Assistance fortune to his ardor lends, Join'd by each army of his succouring friends, With sure success he prosecutes the War, And Victory seems attendant on his car; With conquering arms he gives Germania laws, Avenges every injur'd prince's cause, At once to glory, and to interest true, Asserts their rights, and then protects them too, And had not Fate in Victory's mourning arms Stopp'd by one cruel blow the War's alarms, His rapid power had shar'd the imperial throne, And Germany at once two Cæsars known. Behold of brave Eugene the daring plan When Gallia's lilies Lombardy o'er-ran, The opposing Alps the unwearied Hero cross'd, Turin exulting, view'd the friendly host, Extended, Marsin! o'er too large a field, Thy troops at once in every quarter yield; The rapid chief by this exploit alone, Forced Italy her feeble prince to own. Now through Hungaria's realms his march pursue, On Danube's brink his firm battalions view, While Belgrade's siege employs his great designs, The numerous Turk surrounds him in his lines, With unremitting toil the siege he plies, Nor heeds the Vizier's daring enterprize; He lets him now a new approach essay, And o'er the rapid current urge his way; Then like the fleeting wind with sudden force On the stunn'd foe he pours his thundering horse: Soon to his arms the astonish'd Othmans yield The walls of Belgrade, and the glorious field. Illustrious Elector of Brandenburgh, called the Great Elector, (as the Royal Author of this Poem in his Memoirs for the History of the House of Brandenburgh observes,) by the common voice of his own subjects, and the neighbouring states. The Victories mentioned in the Poem were gained in the year 1675. William! from Elysium's shade, Arise propitious to thy people's aid, To your brave sons the art of Victory tell, And teach those lessons which you knew so well. Your sons by that example mov'd alone, Shall want no precepts drawn from chiefs unknown; O glorious Brandenburgh! thy generous fire A grateful people ever shall admire, The hapless sorrows of thy realms oppress'd, With powerful pity touch'd thy feeling breast, Quitting the crimson borders of the Rhine, On Elbe's disorder'd brink thy legions shine: Like tigers fierce the Swedes with barbarous haste O'er-ran our fields, and laid our country waste, The wretched native saw with wild amaze, The harvest ravag'd, and the city blaze, Wrangle, of easy victory proudly sure, Amidst his rising laurels slept secure, Till wak'd at once he saw destruction near, And in our cause the avenging God appear; The saving Power impetuous speeds his way, Comes, views, and conquers, in one glorious day: In vain the Swede collects his scatter'd force, And tries to stem this new Alcides' course, Feherbellin witness of the glorious deed, Beheld with joy the Gothic army bleed. Thus whilom 'midst Assyria's haughty band, The avenging angel drove with furious hand, Perform'd the will of Heaven's eternal Lord, And millions fell beneath the ethereal sword. But William greater in the exulting hour, With heavenly mercy temper'd victory's power, Pardon'd of The Prince of Homberg, by rashly engaging without orders, hazarded the success of the battle, to whom the Elector gave only the following reprimand. ‘If I were to judge you according to the rigor of Military Law, you have forfeited your life; but God forbid I should tarnish the glory of so happy a day by shedding the blood of a Prince who was one of the principal instruments of my victory.’ Homberg's zeal the impetuous flight, Who rashly join'd too soon the dubious fight, Bade clemency with streams unsullied flow, Nor took revenge upon the suppliant foe, But while the yielding troops he knew to spare, On their arm'd bands he pour'd the rage of War, Till from his borders driven, the hostile train Seek shameful safety on the friendly main. Still new exploits these daring deeds attend, To him her suppliant looks does Prussia send, The wintry tempest and the ice-bound wave But more inflame the ardor of the brave, Astonish'd Thetis to another shore, Upon her frozen bosom bears him o'er: He comes!—where'er they hear his name resound, The vanquish'd Swedes retire, nor tempt a wound; With unresisted arms his legions go, And gain a bloodless conquest o'er the foe. Impatient youths in search of glory warm, From this victorious Prince your model form, Like him pursue with ceaseless toil and pain, Each different path that leads to Honor's fane, Your every scheme to Reason's touchstone bring, And let her prune Imagination's wing; Each motion of the foe with caution scan, Mark all he does perform, and all he can. Strength will be useless found, and courage vain, Unless fair plenty chear your warlike train. Charles XII. of Sweden. Charles, who of wavering fate prov'd each succcess, The height of fame, the depth of sad distress, Would ne'er with tears have mourn'd his ruin'd host, And in one day nine years of Victory lost, Had not 'mid desert wilds the artful Czar Call'd pale-eyed famine to the aid of War. The thunder treasur'd 'gainst your foe with care, To use with speed, not rashness, still prepare. Your plan with cool and stedfast step pursue, Think nothing done while aught remains to do, Nor deem perform'd your destin'd task unless Each different project's crown'd with full success. Thus when from Chaos in confusion hurl'd, The Almighty Fiat form'd the smiling world, Mov'd by his plastic breath the atoms join'd, And took the perfect shape his will design'd. BOOK IV. When Vice triumphant rul'd the iron age, And Justice left her seat to savage rage, 'Gainst the rude neighbour prompt at rapine's call, The rising city rear'd the embattled wall, While shew'd the citadel it's strengthen'd tower, To guard the monarch from rebellious power; Then on the cliff, or by the foaming flood, With dreadful site the well-fenced rampart stood; Each narrow pass by threatening works was barr'd, And frequent forts the spacious frontier guard: As the sharp fangs that arm the lion's jaw, With threaten'd fate the Moor affrighted awe, So where the borders of the realm extend, If bulwarks strong the lengthening lines defend, In vain combine of numerous foes the force, The guarded frontier checks their daring course. War, first of Arts, that savage nation knew, By slow degrees to full perfection grew; Grecia and Rome to fortify their power, Thicken'd the wall alone, or rear'd the tower, With missile weapons from whose threatening height, Against the foe beneath they waged the fight; From the light sling the leaden ball was thrown, The arrow shot, or roll'd the ponderous stone. When now the assailing troops the town inclose, And deals the weighty ram it's thundering blows, Descending dreadful from the lofty tower On the machines a sulphurous stream they shower, While numerous darts the approaching warrior wound, And pierce the temper'd buckler's ample round, Till various schemes the assailant's labors foil, And force the wearied chief to quit his toil. I shall not here my lengthen'd song employ To tell of Priam's fate, and burning Troy. With reverence due my eyes those scenes explore, Proud Ilion's ashes, and Scamander's shore, But tales that Virgil's glowing lines display, Would ill agree with my severer lay. Strong Syracusa's ramparts to destroy See brave Marcellus every scheme employ, While Archimedes' arts his labor foil, Burn his machines, and mock his fruitless toil, Repair each work, each tottering wall sustain, And curb the force of Rome's imperious train. Marseilles secur'd by many a strengthen'd tower Mock'd dauntless Cæsar and his veteran power; Wearied at length, but sure of fortune's aid, He bid the sea their floating works invade.— Thus check'd the siege long, bloody, and severe, Of Rome's experienced chiefs the bold career. In later times the powers infernal strove To wrest the thunder from the hands of Jove, These new machines have chang'd the face of War.— The shell from brazen engines thrown afar Reaches with curve immense the distant wall, It's ponderous force redoubled by the fall, Bursts 'mid the astonish'd train with horrid sound, And cruel deaths unnumber'd scatters round: Meanwhile the cannon with it's thundering breath Sends forth terrific roars, and instant death; Soon as the flash alarms our dazzled eyes, Swift to the mark the iron bullet flies, Lays in the dust the strongest bulwark low, And gives a passage to the assailing foe. This wonderous art reserv'd for modern days, Whose power in sieges Mars has deign'd to praise, Is form'd by sable grains in tubes confin'd, Of smoulder'd charcoal, salt, and sulphur join'd. Once to the world this fatal secret known, Inventive Art to new defence has flown; No more to guard the town from hostile fears She builds the bulwark, and the turret rears, 'Gainst force which all that checks it's way destroys, New skill she uses, and new arts employs. Vauban, belov'd by Mars, whose forming hand, The best defence of modern ramparts plann'd, O that your glorious shade could now declare The wonderous artifice, the ceaseless care, Which in proud Gallia's perfect forts conspire To check Germania's arms, and Britain's fire; How with strong works you each attack defied, And to the cruel art new force supplied. Now the low works hid by the sheltering ground Despise the thundering cannon's dreadful sound, Strength to the wall the frequent buttress lends, While the vast ditch in front the approach defends. The angle here projects, and there retires, And bastion bastion guards with flanking fires. In the deep foss before the curtain placed, The ravelin see with threatening cannon graced, These second works prepar'd with skill profound, Form a new rampart, and dispute the ground. Round all these labors at a larger space The extended outworks rise, and guard the place, The trenches sink before, where give their aid The cover'd way, and threatening palisade; And the deep glacis spreads it's fatal green, Of combat, and of blood the dreadful scene. What various works has man with plastic skill Drawn from the arts submissive to his will? Who but must think where Gallia's bulwarks lower, Defence has us'd her utmost stretch of power? Yet deem not so, below observe the mine With human rage where arts infernal join, The glacis 'neath your feet the abyss contains, Where the black dust but waits the whizzing trains To raise the parting earth with fiery breath, And strew the neighbouring works with blood and death. Yet after all the effect of care and toil, No ramparts now the insulting foe can foil, For the same art the city which defends, Assistance equal to the assailant lends: The attack it's order and it's method knows, Perils in vain the experienced chief oppose, He wins his way through every threatening power, And awes by numerous troops each hostile tower. Should the bold foe attempt with dauntless face To force his Camp, and so relieve the place, Quick his laborious legions ope the ground, And wide retrenchments all the host surround. The prudent chief his lines contracts with care, For works unguarded ill support the War; The fierce assault unwearied to sustain, Let for relief a strong reserve remain, Then in the Camp, if smiling plenty flow, Mock every effort of the insulting foe. With care the place's strength and weakness learn, And all your powers combin'd against it turn; With cautious step advance, the attack being plann'd, The line, the rule, the compass in your hand, Your parallels along the country draw, And by your winding works the fortress awe. Now from the thundering engine flies the ball, The bulwarks tremble, and the ramparts fall, From their strong posts o'ercome by constant fire, The steady troops that check'd your march retire, From flanking shots that sideway bound along, Soon quit the cover'd way, the hostile throng; Your conquering steps the sloping glacis tread, But there untried the faithless verdure dread, Beneath your feet be sure the wily foe, With sulphurous blast prepares the fatal blow; Be cautious then, advance with anxious pain, Sound well the mines, and spare your valiant train. Before you push the bold attack too far, Mind to conclude the subterranean war; The miner first his useful works askance, Should to the glacis' verdant base advance. To save from hidden death each bold brigade, Assault with fury near the palisade, And when your troops that bloody region awe, Swift to the spot your brazen engines draw, The works shall totter at each fatal blow, While sinks the crumbling bulwark mined below, The trench is fill'd, around the warriors bleed, And to assaults still fresh assaults succeed. Oft while the troops the fugitives pursue, The place they enter, and at once subdue; Thus Gallia's sons by martial ardor fir'd, Advancing boldly as their foes retir'd, Seizing with eager hands the favoring hour, Bent Valenciennes. Hainault's capital to Lewis' power. Observe the soldier, and his rage restrain, Less fierce the savage of the Libyan plain, Unless your power confin'd his fury hold, By plunder lur'd, with savage licence bold, His sanguine crimes while wrath his bosom warms, Shall sully all the lustre of your arms. The cruel chief who lets his troops assuage In carnage and excess their bloody rage, Though Conquest lead him o'er her wide domain, Shall view Disgrace his fairest laurels stain, While all mankind in mercy's cause combin'd, His worth forgetting, curse his ruthless mind. Tilly, who 'neath the imperial eagle fought, By glorious deeds immortal honor bought, One bloody cloud eclips'd it's rays divine, And wip'd his name from memory's hallow'd shrine: And bleeding Magdeburgh thy cries proclaim His tarnish'd glory, and his deathless shame. Ye valiant warriors, if with mournful breath My voice describes the dreadful scene of death, 'Tis to wake horror for the scene of woe, And bid your breasts with indignation glow. Pleas'd with fallacious hopes of sudden peace, Their watchful guard the hapless inmates cease, Lull'd by a faithless truce's mean disguise, The treacherous Tilly seals their wakeful eyes; Now drowsy Morpheus o'er the unthinking train Spreads the soft languors of his leaden reign, On the firm rampart tir'd with constant toil, The slumbering centries press the dewy soil; Security and peace the soldier seize, He quits the trenches for domestic ease; From Stygian shores the lying fiend appears, And with deceitful arm the olive rears, On every side the shouts of joy resound, And Prudence' voice in festive notes is drown'd. The watchful Tilly 'mid the dread repose, Bids his still chiefs their ardent troops dispose, O'er the strong works with silent step, and slow, The cruel Austrian mounts, nor meets a foe. Ah, hapless race! whom empty hope deceives, Lo! peace to treason's power the city leaves; Doubling the horror of the midnight shade, See the funereal wing of death display'd, Remorseless Rage, and Hell's destructive band Arm with infernal swords the victor's hand, Pale Nature groans, and through the thundering skies, With useless aim the gleaming lightning flies. Tilly whose hate no mercy could restrain, Gave to his vengeful troops the loosen'd rein; Slaughter and rapine rage on every side, And the sad walls with native blood are dyed. O'er the fell scene the insatiate chief presides, Inflames their vengeance, and their ravage guides, The example fires the mildest of their train, They force the peaceful house, and sacred fane; The valiant who oppose, the weak who fly, Alike with undistinguish'd horror die. Pierced in the mother's arms the infant's blood Pours o'er the parent's breast a purple flood, The father tries in vain the son to save, But unreveng'd sinks with him to the grave, Nor age, nor sex their hellish rage disarm, To Pity deaf, and blind to Beauty's charm. Feeble with years the hoary priest in vain Grasps with his mournful arms the hallow'd fane; Three hundred fathers bent by wasting time, Slain at the altar's foot increase their crime. While 'midst the horrid scene our eyes behold The timid virgin by despair made bold, By shame impell'd, the dread of danger brave, And fearless plunge in Elbe's ensanguin'd wave. But Heavens! what horrid spectacle appears! What rage unknown each savage bosom sears!— Why in your hands do baneful torches flame? Infernal fiends! who blast the Soldier's name!— See the fierce fires each lofty pile destroy, The city blazes round, another Troy; From house to house the shining ruins glide, And horrid clamors swell on every side; Who 'scape the flames the shining falchions glean, While nature trembles 'mid the infernal scene. So paint our sinking hearts the dread abode, By torturing fiends, and hellish dæmons trod, Where furies in gorgonian terrors clad Chastise the impious, and appal the bad, Where wretches endless torments undergo, And fill the measure of eternal woe. Such, and more dreadful, in those fatal hours Appear'd, O Magdeburgh! thy shatter'd towers, As by the conflagration's lurid ray, Shewn to the sight thy smoaky ruins lay. The city once of peace the fair retreat, Of every smiling art the favorite seat, In the short space of one unhappy night, Lies a sad desert to the passer's sight, Where with his crimes fatigu'd the soldier stands, Proud of the slaughter of his savage hands, While Elbe's affrighted waves forsake the shore With corses choak'd, and red with human gore. Did Fortune's smiles the cruel Tilly crown For loosing vengeance on the unhappy town? Devouring flames a useful conquest spoil'd, And one vast scene of devastation wild Fair Magdeburgh appears, whose ruins lie A dreadful prospect to the Victor's eye, And seem to call the immortal powers to shed A tenfold vengeance on the Author's head. BOOK V. Pallas, whose hand can through each devious road Conduct your steps to Victory's bright abode, Teach you success in every hour to find, And for each season form the Hero's mind, Shall now in verse the prudent art disclose, To guard your peaceful quarter's calm repose. When hoary Winter bids each freezing wind Range o'er the regions free and unconfin'd, When foe to Zephyr, Boreas' raging blast Lays the rich field and smiling orchard waste, No more the trees when leaves and fruitage grace, But icicles and snow usurp their place, When biting frosts the harden'd rivulet chain, And the sad herds forsake the barren plain, Then the cold Camp upon the mountain's brow Shrinks as the cutting winds tempestuous blow; Awhile the warriors to the season yield, Stop their exploits, and quit the ice-bound field; Though either side alike breathe martial fire, From Winter's freezing powers they both retire; Scatter'd in towns, from War they respite take, And for warm roofs their canvas walls forsake. The soldier train'd with hardy limbs to bear, The rage of battle, and the force of War, Should in the winter taste of quiet's joys, For constant toil the strongest frame destroys. Here warlike Art it's nicest care supplies, To guard his sacred rest from quick surprise; Ready and form'd for fight a numerous train The insulting offers of the foe restrain, O'er all the front the well-fenced posts extend, And by their force the lengthen'd line defend; Each narrow pass that Nature's hands have barr'd From the bold foe must strong detachments guard; Some leader fam'd, in whom the chief confides, Protects the approach, and o'er the chain presides, While round the swift dragoon and fleet hussar, Prevent with watchful eyes each wile of War, With constant care distress the harrass'd foes, Hang o'er their march, and all their schemes disclose, Report each fresh design, each movement new, Distress their Camps, and baffle every view. When each detail is settled in your breast That prudence could foresee or skill suggest, And all your cares and troubles seem as o'er, One new contingency may give you more; When cold Orion binds the whiten'd fields, And o'er the flood a transient passage yields, The wakeful chief her joys bids Quiet cease, And Danger courts amidst the smiles of Peace. 'Tis not enough your host secure may lie, It's discipline severe, it's spirit high, You must with care replace the generous train Who nobly perish'd on the ensanguin'd plain, Conquest is bought with blood, and every shade Whose corse on honor's field was bleeding laid, Will a supply of dauntless hearts demand, To assert the glory of the daring band; Then to these prudent precepts bend your mind, And succour firm in new-rais'd levies find. As by the watchful fisher's wily hand The river's silent inmates are trepann'd, So the false lustre of deceitful gold Lures the poor laborer from the farm or fold; Ignorant of what excites contending kings, Chance to the intrepid band his footsteps brings, Where courage firm, and discipline severe, Change to a soldier's fire a peasant's fear. Success in War from numerous troops may flow, Your force alone may check the timid foe.— Of perfect limbs, and from a generous breed, With careful glance select the martial steed, From offer'd numbers cull'd with cautious hand, Young, vigorous, docile, like your warrior band. Let bounteous Ceres still with laughing eye, Your crouded Camp with constant food supply, The splendid arts of victory all are cross'd, Unless more useful arts subsist your host. This Camp, this People, by your motions sway'd, Twice every day shall dire disease invade, Whose force, if not allay'd by prudent care, With cruel fangs shall thin the ranks of War; Useless the sons of Galen find their skill, Unless your plenteous stores abundance fill: Should this important duty 'scape your mind, Soon 'mid your fainting legions shall you find, Drawn from the barren rocks that form her cave, Her horrid pinions squalid Famine wave; A thousand ills her fatal steps attend, Seditious cries the ambient ether rend, Weakness and Fear, and Misery's tainting breath, Pallid Despair, inxorable Death; Then 'mid the Camp where dying myriads groan, Say will you fight deserted and alone? Prevent the evil, and with careful eye, Observe that plenteous marts your host supply, So shall your arms amidst repose prepare For future triumphs, and successful War. While the bold chief, intent on new alarms, With care arrays his levied force for arms, Each generous leader now at ease reclines, And 'midst his laurel wreaths the myrtle twines, His faithful consort full of blushing charms Forgets the pains of absence in his arms; Ah happy hours! ah moments doubly dear! Purchas'd by many a pang, and many a tear, What joy an end of gushing grief to know, Dried by the hand whose dangers made it flow! To hear his glorious deeds with new delight, Pride of the War, and honor of the fight, To feel that heart which danger ne'er could move Pant 'midst the charming agonies of Love! With kisses sweet in amorous rapture press'd, To stop that voice which steel'd the soldier's breast, Rous'd him to gallant deeds with martial breath, And taught the way to Victory, or death! While on his faithful partner's breast reclin'd, Rests the brave head to peaceful thoughts resign'd, Pleas'd with his presence round him jocund move The beauteous pledges of connubial love: His hands victorious now endearing seize, Or with their infant arms embrace his knees, And burn to tread the thorny path that leads To martial honors and immortal deeds: A thousand little arts they smiling try, While every motion charms a parent's eye, That rears the buckler with a feeble hand, This tries in vain to wield the shining brand, Or lift the helmet, while their breasts aspire To trace the glorious footsteps of their sire. Thus tender Hymen knows with gentle power On faithful hearts unnumber'd joys to shower, When fond esteem in every look's express'd, And mutual passion fires each feeling breast, Joys to those trifling tribes of youth unknown, Who pay their vows to Change's fickle throne, Chaste is the bliss that fires the hero's heart, And pure that love where weakness has no part: He knows the bonds of softness to despise, And swift to arms at Honor's mandate flies. Amidst these joys that sense and duty guide, Where healthful Rest, and Temperance preside, To shameful sloth no wiles luxurious charm, Relax his courage, and unnerve his arm, Ready for War when Glory's call requires, Stung with new rage, and warm'd by fiercer fires. Before the Winter ends his slow career, And opening flowrets paint the vernal year, To posts advanced the eager Generals haste, The scheme's projected, and the encampment traced, The roads to march the assembling troops are plan'd By skilful engineers with cautious hand, While the slow work the impatient chief pursues, And with strict eye the growing labor views; Each various art with prudent arm prepares, That asks his present or his future cares; Sage Diffidence the mother of Success, Bids him his thoughts to every scheme address, Chases soft slumber from his closing eyes, And to his toil a constant zeal supplies. The foe, she cries, with ceaseless ardor view, Mark what he does, and what he means to do, His Camp in every part with spies surround, Watch every motion, catch each trifling sound, Be to your mind his every look display'd, Learn his design, and even his thoughts pervade: Spare not the dross that tempts mankind to sin, The certain knowledge of his schemes to win. With stranger eyes still prove your favorite plan, And with severest care your actions scan. Deem not yon hills whose summits high extend From sudden rage your quarters can defend, Nor the bold troops who guard yon river's brink With shining arms a certain barrier think. The monstrous Alps which seem'd with lengthen'd chain A bulwark firm to Rome's superb domain, Yield to Italia's plains a vain relief, Scal'd by the ardor of the Punic chief: In vain their summits to his march oppose Cliffs rough with rocks, and white with endless snows, Through undiscover'd paths he shapes his way, Surprises, fights, and wins the glorious day. Vendome depending on the mountain's guard, Whose heights fair Lombardy thy frontier barr'd, Saw brave Eugene by ways then unexplor'd, With daring troops the rapid Adige ford, Strike with undaunted speed the vigorous blow, And free from Seine's command the exulting Po. Those torrents mark!—when Winter's power they own, And o'er their stream an icy bridge is thrown, Sudden the adverse host with rapid course May pass the channel and your quarters force, While your disorder'd troops dispers'd by fright Shall seek their safety in inglorious flight; Thus shall one fatal moment veil in shame Your former deeds, and blast your martial fame. A quarter forced a thousand ills attend, A thousand fears your baffled legions bend, Your troops at once rebellious and dismay'd, Your influence lost, your orders disobey'd, Despair and grief to ardent zeal succeed, In those that follow, and in those that lead, Each sanguine hope by one sad check you lose, And ruin's certain if the foe pursues. Bournonville foil'd, yet in misfortune brave, Pass'd with his troops the Rhine's majestic wave, Turenne retreats before his numerous train, Nor dares attempt the mountains of Lorrain: Of art regardless, and of fortune sure, Ere Winter's cold, the German too secure His scatter'd forces o'er Alsatia spreads, Nor heeds the danger hanging o'er their heads; But while he thought the imperial bird might close Her drowsy eyes secure from following foes, Sudden Turenne (the opposing mountains cross'd) O'er the wide champain pours the assembled host; That day he gain'd by one important blow An easy Victory o'er a scatter'd foe, While the astonish'd Chief his host to save, With speed repasses Rhine's tempestuous wave. Even Winter's frosts shall aid your rapid course, And hours of rest assist your daring force; By care assembled, and by ardor led, Against the foe dispers'd, your legions head, By fear dismay'd, disorder'd by surprise, Without a blow his ruin'd army flies. To conduct sage her aid let speed unite, Dispel his forces, and pursue his flight, Examples drawn from every age unfold, That favoring fortune still attends the bold. So to the Saxon race the chief appear'd O'er Stanislaus his favoring shield who rear'd, When quitting laurels for the myrtle bough, Augustus paid to love the tender vow. While lull'd to ease by Venus' witching charms, He left his glory for a mistress' arms, His brow adorn'd with Luxury's soft crown, Forgetting Poland, War, and fair renown; With sudden force the Ammon of the north Resistless pour'd his veteran legions forth, Disturb'd with arms each Bacchanalian rite, While Love and hireling legions take their flight, And the sad sovereign sees his rival place Another on that throne he us'd to grace. So when the eagle, favorite bird of Jove, Wings his bold flight the thundering clouds above, And on the lessening earth beholds his prey O'er the steep hills, or through the forests stray, Swift to his death on soaring wing he flies, And to his eyry bears the bleeding prize. BOOK VI. Thus has Victoria taught me to impart The rigid precepts of her glorious Art. We've trac'd the rules of Battle from their source, The power of Discipline, and Order's force, How the wise chief the Encampment may secure, And keep from fierce attacks his quarters sure, With ceaseless fire the threatening fortress awe, And bend the city to the Victor's law. Rising to nobler heights, my closing strain Shall trace the image of the embattled plain, Teach those who tempt this ocean's dangerous wave From rocks and shoals their venturous barks to save, And lead the warrior youth with helpful care To scenes of combat, and the rage of War. Behold the glorious lists, the famous field, Where oft the victor chief has learn'd to yield, Lists which the shame of many a warrior tell, Where William stumbled, and where Marsin fell, Here oft has fail'd the bold adventurer's soul, And flag'd his ardor ere he reach'd the goal, This was the scene of Pompey's, Pyrrhus' fall, With Crassus, Mithridates, Hannibal, The bloody vestige of their loss remains A dreadful object on the crimson'd plains: Yet in these fields by better genius taught, Cæsar and Macedonia's Monarch fought, Here triumph'd Condé, Villars, brave Turenne, Gustavus, Maurice, Luxemburgh, Eugene. O valiant youths, by their exploits inspir'd, Distrust your breasts with flame impetuous fir'd. Few of the daring train who court renown Receive from Victory's hands the envied crown, Some new attempt the conqueror's wish employs, And one sad day his former fame destroys: So the bold chief who Ilium's cause sustain'd, Against a hundred kings the war maintain'd, Tydides yields, their backs the Grecians turn, Brave Ajax rages, while the vessels burn, Patroclus sinks beneath his weighty blow, And quits Achilles' armour to the foe, But check'd at once in conquest's bright career, He vanquish'd falls beneath the Pelian spear. Such fate alas! attended Charles XII. Charles's fame, Nine years of glory, and nine years of shame. If chiefs like these in combat vers'd have found Their honors fade as fortune sudden frown'd, If they have fall'n from fortune's giddy height, What can ye hope yet novices in fight?— Scarce wean'd by fierce Bellona's fostering arms, Young in the field, and new to War's alarms. But, spite of sage Instruction's prudent force Like fiery steeds impatient for the course, Ye break away from Reason's sacred rein, Ardent to tempt the dangers of the plain.— Let not the flattering voice of foolish pride, Nor self opinion's breath your movements guide, Examine first your breast with strictest care, And learn what talents, and what strength are there, Nor take the ambitious hopes that fire your heart, For the pure flame that Genius' rays impart; In vain you boast the strength of those who wage The sportive fight on London's barbarous stage, Baffling the foe with sinews never tir'd, By clowns applauded, and by fools admir'd. Should you excel the giant race who move The impious battle 'gainst the throne of Jove, Whose arms to scale Olympus' summit, throw Proud Ossa's cliffs on Pelion's craggy brow; Should you with this the dauntless heart combine Of raging Mars when thundering armies join; All these are weak the applauding Muse to gain, And strength, and size, and courage all are vain. Much more Minerva from the chief requires Wisdom should guide his breast while Courage fires, There Valor cool with temperate Ardor lies,— Swift without rashness, without weakness wise, His prudent care should o'er his troops preside, And 'mid the battle's rage their efforts guide, Check rude Disorder's flight with eager hand, And aid the fainting, or the o'er-number'd band, With watchful art before their want prepare Each needful requisite of doubtful War; Oppose fresh schemes to every new alarm, And only yield to Fate's superior arm. Your senses quick, your judgment clear and just, Act from yourself, nor aught to Fortune trust, Resolve in council, cautious, timid, slow, But verge to rashness when you strike the blow, Nor tempt the fight for causes slight and vain, Where slaughter reaps the harvest of the plain. To you her force the trusting state confides, Your skill the soldier's generous ardor guides, Prompt at his leader's nod to arms he flies, And marks each signal with assiduous eyes; Give but the word, attentive to command Pours on the embattled foe the veteran band; So the fierce Tiger on the Lion flies, While purple gore his tawny bosom dyes. Behold the field by morn's sad lustre, spread With dreadful heaps, the dying, and the dead; Here of your foes the crimson currents glide, There swells the blood of friends the horrid tide, Stretch'd o'er the ground your warriors laid supine, Remain sad victims on Ambition's shrine, While the pale mother, and the weeping bride Your triumphs mourn, and curse your ruthless pride; Rather than such distress your minds should please, Rather than shine in fatal spoils like these, Perish of Victory's meed the tarnish'd crown! By frantic passion gain'd, not true renown. Say, who in bleeding trophies would appear, Or boast a glory which he buys so dear? No! with parental care your army lead, Behold with grief the meanest soldier bleed, They love their leaders, but their tyrants hate, We owe their lives and welfare to the state. When Mars permits be each attention shewn, And spare their blood though lavish of your own. But when by various wrongs your bosom's steel'd, Your groaning country calling to the field, And 'twixt the foe and you the uncertain scale Of fight must shew whose fortune shall prevail, Eager for War, and prodigal of blood, Loose all their ardor like a rushing flood, Then shall they shew that valor courts applause, Nor fears to perish in a glorious cause. The chief, whose breast Bellona's precepts fill, Ne'er tempts the fight repugnant to his will, By foresight warn'd, and of his cohorts sure, He wards each offer'd blow with arm secure, Soldier in action, though a Chief in care, He ne'er receives, but meets the shock of War: Still smiling fortune hears the assailant's call, The ponderous ram batters the opposing wall, O'erthrows with dreadful crush the lofty tower, And gives a passage to the invader's power, While with faint arms within, the trembling train The falling bulwarks strive to guard in vain. Always attack, so shall Bellona kind, Smile on your banners waving to the wind, And favoring fortune aid the daring arms, Whose rapid charge the expecting foe alarms. But should the fickle power in Prudence' spite Wing to the adverse host her changing flight, Meet each distress with brow unruffled still, And every frown of Fate correct by skill, With better hopes your downcast legions warm, And stand unshaken 'midst the threatening storm; For as the dusky scenes of sable night Shew with more force the Stars refulgent light, So 'mid misfortune's gloom with tenfold blaze, Your glorious fame shall dart unnumber'd rays, Courage her native worth with pride advance, And glorious Wisdom triumph over Chance. If Villars saw his gallant bands retreat, Denain o'erpaid Malplaquet's sad defeat, One happy hour may years of loss repay, As vanquish'd Villars won at last the day. The fight unnumber'd different forms combine, When in the plain the embattled armies join In open combat 'neath their leader's eyes, Each daring host it's utmost efforts tries: While the high cliffs, or brooks that flow between, Of less, but bloodier conflicts are the scene, When to the Chief strong posts their aid afford, And the well-chosen ground assists the sword. See to the field array'd in warlike pride, The panting troops advance on either side, The extending front increases as they go, This, (instant-form'd) attacks at once the foe; The rapid squadrons swift as thought engage, And seek the hostile troops who shun their rage, 'Mid the thick clouds which smoak and dust afford With dreadful lustre gleams the murderous sword; Slaughter pursues the troops by fear dismay'd, And hostile carnage dyes each reeking blade; Here the deserted foot (the equestrian train Whose ardor should their naked flanks sustain, Forced from the field to take their rapid course,) Dread of the approaching foe the fatal force, Unnumber'd deaths while brazen cannons shower, Onward impetuous moves the adverse power, The bayonet shines with dreadful lustre bright, Sudden the astonish'd foe prepares for flight, Now fresh battalions rushing to engage, Attack his fenceless flanks with tenfold rage, He fears, he faints, he yields, and trembling flies, While human blood the thirsty herbage dyes; A thousand murderous tubes with dreadful fire Pour horrid slaughter as his ranks retire, Each runs dispers'd as fortune casts his lot, His post, his colors, and his chief forgot. Ne'er let the fears of scatter'd troops repose, Ne'er build a golden bridge for flying foes, The conquering chief resolv'd no time to lose, The fugitives with slacken'd rein pursues, The blest occasion grasps with eager care, And one illustrious day concludes the War. Eugene near Hockstet's walls where Gallia's host On ground unfit Tallard and Marsin post, Pours on each wing the battle's furious tides, Their centre pierces, and their force divides; Disarm'd and vanquish'd, Gallia's haughty race, In captive crouds the victor's triumph grace; No more their troops the scatter'd foes combine, But fly inglorious to the distant Rhine. Thus in their turn, when in Almanza's field, The British Lions to the Lily yield, The gallant Berwick, fortunately brave, Iberia's throne to happy Bourbon gave. Now other fights behold!—on yonder brow That frowns tremendous on the vales below, Extended see the proud battalions stand, Veil'd in impervious clouds of dust and sand. Behold the foe approach, he forms his lines, Full in his front the powerful phalanx shines, Unfit the ground the charging horse to bear, The rapid cuirassiers possess the rear: The Chief advances first with careful eye, To mark their station and their force descry, The skilful conduct of one well-aim'd blow May give him conquest, and destroy the foe, Of time, and place, if proper use he makes, His weakness marks, and each advantage takes. His daring foot advancing on the right, Scale 'mid the cannon's rage the mountain's height, Attack'd, confounded in their strengthen'd post, Scatter'd and vanquish'd flies their ruin'd host, The Victor profits by his foes disgrace, And rush the horse unwearied to the chace. Thus Friburg's day would Condés glory raise.— At the battle of Val.With equal courage, and with equal praise Thus Saxe before his grateful monarch's eyes, Offering of foes a bloody sacrifice, Forced the confederate bands to sudden flight, And placed his ensigns on their mountains height. Nought stops the chief whose arms Bellona guides If in his Camp the foe his legions hides, Fearing again to meet in open field The force that taught his troops o'er-match'd to yield, If faintly brave, and wisely circumspect, He makes the strengthen'd post his troops protect, Still will the hero (some new scheme employ'd) Force him to dare the fight he would avoid, By various fears his troubled breast alarms, Turns to the neighbouring towns his threatening arms, Before three cities now at once appears, And fills their failing hearts with equal fears, While trembling each expects the impending blow, Distress and famine wait the wasting foe, Forced to the piercing calls of want to yield, And dare on equal terms the embattled field: For from it's dam will sooner fly the fawn, And quit the breast from whence it's life is drawn, Than the wise chief abandon to your power The towns which Plenty on his legions pour. When of your march the swiftness to avoid, The subtle foe has rapid streams employ'd, And thinks their waves shall stop your destin'd way, Reflect how Hannibal obtain'd the day; On Rhone's high banks while Rome opposing stood, Feining, he elsewhere fords the dangerous flood, And joining artful wiles to daring force, The Consul mock'd who thought to check his course. O glorious leader of my rival's cause, Prince Charles of Lorrain. Charles! from a foe receive thy just applause, A foe from envy and from hatred free, Who pays the tribute due to truth and thee: The swelling stream of that majestic tide, Whose waves from France the imperial realms divide, And on it's guarded brink the embattled band, In vain the progress of thy arms withstand, Rhine, troops, and threatening danger, all in vain Oppose the march, no peril stops Lorrain. In different corps the soldiers charge the foe, Strike all at once the unexpected blow, O'er the swift stream the bridges sudden laid, Secure thy passage, and thy courage aid, To thy assailing ardor Gallia yields, And Austrian legions waste Alsatia's fields. Say shall the fame of Tholus' day be lost, When Lewis XIV. Lewis forced Batavia's strengthen'd post? Pass'd Rhine thy waves with matchless courage o'er, And swimming reach'd secure the opposing shore?— Such are the deeds that Mars delights to bless, Where courage nobly daring, gives success. But if to solid fame your breast aspire, With heavenly Mercy temper Valor's fire, The bravest chief that graced the Roman state, In every place and every action great, When bow'd the world to his triumphant reign, Preserv'd his foes on fam'd Pharsalia's plain. At Fontenoy see Lewis XV. Lewis, generous foe! Mild in success, console the captive's woe, Tempering with God-like mercy martial rage, His generous hands the prisoners grief assuage, They bathe with grateful tears the Victor's arms, His valor bends them, but his mercy charms, To War's distress his goodness lustre gives, A Hero conquers, but a God forgives. Pursue, brave youths, the illustrious chiefs I sing, So shall exulting fame on eagle's wing, Chanting with ceaseless voice each deathless name, To distant regions tell your honest fame. While listening virtue on her heavenly throne, Of heroes proud, Astræa deigns to own, Fond of the chiefs on whom fair Mercy waits, Shall ope Eternity's stupendous gates; There in the seats for Innocence design'd, Their glorious meed the martial Virtues find, There sit above the rest the truly Great, Who bless with peaceful arts the happy state, With laurels deck'd, and shining garments here Good Kings and virtuous Magistrates appear, Conquerors how few, but every Chief who draws His sword for Justice and his Country's cause. O should you one day take this generous flight, And scale of Heaven sublime the exalted height, Think of the Martial Muse, whose voice severe, To fame heroic urg'd the bold career, Temper'd with precept, by example fir'd, And all your heart with Virtue's charms inspir'd.
