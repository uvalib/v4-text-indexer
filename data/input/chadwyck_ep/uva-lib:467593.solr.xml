      <field name="fulltext">“Nec fonte labra prolui Caballino: Nec in bicipiti somniâsse Parnasso Memini, ut repentè sic Poëta prodirem. Heliconidasque, pallidamque Pirenen Illis remitto, quorum imagines lambunt Hederæ sequaces. Ipse semipaganus Ad sacra Vatum carmen affero nostrum.” Persius; Sat. Prolog. I ne'er did on Parnassus take a slumber; Nor ever tasted of that famous spring, Which maketh poets so sublimely sing; By washing from their heads all kinds of lumber. In short, it does so purge and scour their brains, That bards, thus favour'd, chaunt with ease their strains. On me the muses look with bashful mind; Prudes,—they perhaps want courting to be kind. I love the girl, who, willing, yields her charms, And cries, come, Pasquin, come unto my arms. —Thus then to me no powers of verse belong! I only sing an humble rustic's song. “Safe from the Bar, the Pulpit, and the Throne, Yet touch'd and sham'd by Ridicule alone.” Pope. “You think this cruel!—Take it for a Rule, No creature smarts so little as a Fool.” Id. A GRAVE, SOLEMN, AND SUBLIME EPISTLE; ADDRESSED TO THE CRITICS. THE ARGUMENT OF THE WORK. The poet begins by paying his respects (as becometh him) to the reverend, sage, and great critics;—to the sapient and well-skilled old maids, &amp;c. &amp;c. which composed the grand council which was summoned by Boram to sit in judgement on two straggling, unfortunate, but inoffensive, letters; which however had given Boram great and terrible alarm.—Equal alarm, gentle reader, as tho' they had been a warrant, or had proclaimed the rough voice of those birds of justice, vulgarly ycleped bum-bailiffs.—He addresseth these mighty personages in a grave, solemn, and sublime epistle, done in the poet's best manner.—He humbly remonstrates with them (who are qualified to sit in the highest chair of criticism), on the demeaning themselves so much as to even deign to look at such little miscarriages—such trifling productions of an author's pen, as private letters.—Such great people attacking these weak things, is like a parcel of crows and hawks devouring the harmless carcase of a poor little wren.—These great censors exhort Boram to take no notice of these things.—Commend their own learning, but don't like to shew it, except on grave and great occasions. “Nec deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus inciderit” says Horace, Horace, de arte Poetica, v. 191. and so it seems think they. They desire the priest when he goes to shew Lord?the offending Letters, and to request his interference and chastisement of the daring author, that he would at the same time remind him of B?kl?w living, which the priest thinks very long in coming to him.—The ill-nature of the incumbent noticed in being so long-winded, and not civilly departing this life to please his superiors.—The Pope and the Devil. A new and sure method to hasten the departure of the present possessor of this living, and to ensure it to the man of B? house. Next follows an Exordium, in which is given a poetical account of the hero of the ensuing tale. It may indeed be properly entitul'd, the Curate become Rector; a Vision, or Trance. And truly it is a trance of no common nature, as it has already continued many years, and is still likely to continue, unless indeed some medicines of the refrigerant and antispasmodic kind, are soon administered; which may probably relieve him from this dire and afflicting disorder. A pretty allusion to a bladder full of wind. A comparison of a jack-daw full of noise and nonsence. The chief poem then opens with a solemn invocation to the genius of Pindar to assist the bard in this grave undertaking.—He invokes however not the Theban bard of old, who used to mount on the wings of an eagle, and soon get out of people's sight; but the merry Bard of Britain, who rides indeed a prancinge Pgasus, but one with whom we may keep company. The poet compareth himself to Homer singing of frogs and mice, as his subject may perhaps be deemed equally important. He professeth great respect for priests, when they behave like such. Speaketh angrily, yet with his usual wit, of a new way of robbing the Church or committing sacrilege; namely, by putting on a black coat and becoming a clergyman, as it were, surreptitiously. The poet here supposeth, by the bye, that this practice is not likely to become very general, as the qualifications requisite are not in every common person's possession;—such as an extraordinary degree of impudence, and a great share of—piety! Reader, you understand Rhetoric, and can tell when a poet or an orator makes use of Rhetorical figures.—If a man departs somewhat from plain speech, you'll not therefore mistake his meaning.—The cause of Churches tumbling down, and steeples cracking, sagaciously explained. The poet proceeds to tell his friend Boram that a little learning might be useful, were it only to make common people think that he was possessed of a great deal. As a cunning man with only a few shillings in his pocket would make people think he had as many guineas. He would have him especially learn to write a letter, as it looks rather aukward in one who has stumbled, through unlucky stars, on ordination, not to be able to return an answer to a letter or note when he receives one. Pasquin seriously recommends it to him to procure a book called the polite Letter-Writer; or otherwise to permit one of his servants to dictate letters to him. Boram all at once astonishes his servants with a sudden and miraculous display of the profoundest knowledge, in a learned criticism upon a book written by one of his neighbours. —The poet talketh of friar Bacon and his brazen head. Would fain have likened his hero to the former, but his muse, who would not permit him to tell a lie, compares him to the latter. The servants summon'd to the lecture. A pretty simile of a cat and a mouse. A new character introduced, namely, his faithful servant Toby.—Toby suspecteth the priest is going to raise the devil, and is not a little frighten'd. The beginning of the lecture however dispels all his fears. His servants stare at their master's seeming critical sagacity, and an old woman is so enraptured at his deep disquisions on the Greek quotations contained in that work, that by an unlucky inundation from above, she wets Boram's best Parlour floor.—Boram is angry, and damneth her. The poet exhorteth him to patience.—Boram swears again, and by this unluckly accident a stop is put to his critical harangue. Pasquin talks of Dawes, Hoogeveen, Bentley, Monboddo, and Burgess.—Likeneth Boram to these great men in Greek literature. Laugheth at their shallowness compared to Boram's profoundity. Wonders how a lord, like Monboddo, can descend to become learned, as learning is by no means fashionable among lords and great men. The poet returns again to Boram. Discourses with him about pies and tarts, and the best way of making sillabubs.—Boram's vast knowledge in these matters commended. A dialogue between Boram and a washer-woman in the Brewhouse concerning caps, gowns, and other deep matters. Boram telleth her a melancholy tale how a certain person who sent him a few years ago a printed letter which he could not answer, had like by this to have drove him mad, and made him almost kill his horse by riding him to lawyers and counsellors to punish him. Telleth her how this same man has lately sent him a couple of letters, which he was unable to answer.—She expresseth great surprise at this, as he had lately shewn himself so learned in commenting upon Greek. Boram maketh her his confidant: ingenuously telleth her that he knows no more of Greek and Latin than she does. Always hates in company to hear them mentioned.—Not being able to answer these notes, he tells her, how like a school boy that has been flogged, he runs crying about, and shews them to every one he meets with, in hopes that some one may dictate or write for him an answer.—But no one having done him this kindness, Boram puts to the door, pulls out pen and ink, and begs the good woman to write something for him.—The good lady complies: Scribbles a letter. Boram seals it up as his own. Here Boram again repeats to the old lady his history. Talks of his vast riches. Proves the ridiculousness and untruth of the saying, ex nihilo nihil fit; for out of nothing he createth a great deal. Boasts of his having been at College. The poet here introduceth a simile of a calf that suck'd a full-milk'd cow, but never became a bit the better for it. Talketh of the folly of sowing good seed in bad soil; with other deep and grave reflections. Boram remembereth to forget, as usual, to mention his office of clerk and bell-ringer, when he was at college; which the poet kindly mentions for him. He tells her (what indeed he had often told her before,) how great a man he is, and how much greater he soon shall be! Damns all the parish as a plebeian, vulgar race, and not fit to keep him company.—The poet hinteth to him how kind they once were, when they covered for him his naked back. Boram damneth. Pasquin prayeth. The washer-woman intercedeth; but Boram departeth in wrath. Boram being full of the irascible fluid, like a cloud, over loaded with the electric, discharges it on the first objects he meets with; which happens, unluckily for the poor man, to be his faithful and honest servant Toby.—He tells Toby he's a bastard. Toby sensibly perceiving that his master was in one of his periodical ravings, calmly replieth, that his mother knew that matter best. That he himself had no hand at all in the operation. And that if his mother had a mind to try the strength of his father's powder, before his father had taken out a certificate for shooting, whatever game they might hit, he could not be answerable for. Or if their appetites were keen, and they could not wait while grace was said, before they fell to, theirs was the blame, and not his. Boram upon this waxeth still more wrath. The poet trembles for the fate of Toby. Gently toucheth the priest's elbow, and reminds him of what philosophy saith respecting anger.— Mentions Epictetus. Boram damneth Epictetus, and before he was aware, says (what indeed was very true!) that he never read a line of him in his life.—He giveth Toby a cuff. This raiseth Toby's anger; and Toby telleth him something about killing a hare of a Sunday.—This giveth occasion to the poet to introduce a most beautiful episode, which Homer might have inserted in his Iliad, containing the life and adventures of the above hare.—This unlucky assertion of Toby, had liked however to have cost Boram very dear; for raising himself suddenly up to give a more than ordinary vent to his anger,—he strikes his head against the mantel-piece.—Fate, or the density of his pericranium; or perhaps fate might have nothing at all to do in the matter, for it is probable that his wig has here all the merit;—saved his head from the dire stroke.—The curls being by this deranged, causeth Boram to depart to put them again in their proper order. This of course puts an end to the story. The poet desireth the learned and mighty critics, the grave and sage reviewers, not to forget to mention his excellent art in interweaving after the manner of the great poets, his predecessors, Homer and Virgil, the former history of his hero, by way of Episode.— The poet commendeth himself, and then concludes. Ye Doctors sage and learn'd, men of discerning! How could you on such trifles shew your learning? Ye that abound;—nay overflow,—with wit, To criticise such striplings, was it meet? Nay, gentlemen, I think it was unfit.— You should have passed them by, as in the street, When little folks to you pull off their hat, You notice them with scorn, and proudly say—what dirty thing is that! So, gentlemen, it would much better Have become your worships to have given advice To this great man, who's frightenn'd by a letter; As tho' meer paper could pull off his wig.— You should have said, good man, be not so nice; This letter seemeth with no mischief big. Why then exalt thyself and sit at ease Amidst an harmless shower of hail and peas. We know, good man, that you yourself can't write; And we, tho' full of learning of all kinds, Don't like to shew it on a thing so slight, Else we could send it out as Æolus does his winds: And soon o'erwhelm your foe, and drive him far.— But then we deem the man too cheap a prize, For men of our vast size, To enter into any puny war. We want to engage some lion, or a boar Thinking without doubt of the following lines of the poet,“Optat aprum, aut fulvum descendere monte leonem.” Virgil. Æneid. iv. V. 159., And then you'd hear how we would make him roar; Take our advice, and let him keep his road: Perhaps the man is mad; and where's the wonder! And the next time you go to see my Lord, Desire him like Jove to launch his thunder Against this sad and wicked wight, Who has put us all:—no, you—in such a fright! To such a man a pardon there's no giving.— Then add, my Lord,—remember B? Living. For, Boram, we know all the story; To us and every one 'tis plain, That if you do not this said living gain, You'll never pray him out of purgatory. And that will be a grievous evil, For learned men assert 'tis next door to the devil. But Boram 'tis a grievous thing, that's fact, That the incumbent won't resign his breath; He does not as a gentleman by you act; Else would he civil say, come gentle death, Come take me, that I may make room, For a much better man that sadly wants to come. Not to do this, too tell him, that in France, Wouldbe esteemed e'en now great want of bienseance. And that's a place for no more good appointed, They have rebell'd against the Lords anointed. Which shew'd of modesty they had great lack, To dare to throw the saddle off their back. For we are told that when king's choose to ride, Upon their subjects back's they ought to get astride. And if they prick us when we tarry, As kings have legs like other men, We ought with patience still to carry Our heavy load, Along the bad road;— Yea, and if they alight, to let them mount agen. But here's a matter that gives greater hope;— Go, tell him that St. Peter's heir the Pope, Has lately a license kindly given To Satan; and he deals in wine and rum; And if the gentleman will haste to come, Three bottles in a day shall make his hell a heaven! Go tell him this, and he with us wo'n't stay, But to the Devil soon will speed away. Three bottles, three, he'll cry, and that of rum! On earth I seldom more than two do take, Kind Satan I'm in haste to you to come, A room in hell I'll have, and so room for me make. POEM. “Incipe Mænalios mecum mea tibia versus.” Virgil. Genius of Pindar! bard sublime! Whose various, well-tun'd lays Can mirthful laughter raise. Whose pleasing, well-form'd, rhyme, When old dame grief is drawing nigh, With rugged brow and scowling eye, Dispels the hagard sprite, and raises us to joy! Vouchsafe I thee implore, To lend thy mighty aid to one, Who sends his little vessel off from shore, And sails for that fair mount, ycleped Helicon. A puny imitator I, no more than thee; At Pindar's fount of old I love to drink: And if thou tak'st his name; why pray let me Attend the band;—at least sit on the brink Of that clear stream, of which the bard of old Drank such intoxicating draughts, that he To most seem'd drunk;—but daring sure and bold! Pindar! thy sire in lofty strains, Of mighty heroes us'd to speak in praise: Thou bestow'st thy toil and pains On subjects of less weight; and my weak lays On subjects yet still less descend to speak.— But father Homer you well know, Had not his mouth so very nice, But he his dignity aside would throw, And sing a pretty tale about the frogs and mice. Thus have these tiny creatures gain'd much glory, By being mention'd in old Homer's story. So, like this bard, I have a mighty mind, To sing about a creature of as small a kind. Hector, Achilles, and those great, tall men, Did not alone employ old Homer's pen. To such he would not empty all his rhyme:— This seemeth thy taste, Peter, and 'tis mine. People of great and high degree, Such as are call'd your folks of quality, We cannot always be among. Ulysses, as you know, was much inclin'd, To see the various manners of mankind, As many poets tell us in their song. Thus, Peter, 'tis with us I ween, Sometimes with great men; now with less we're seen. Now with a duke;—now on the verdant grass, At harmless sport with some kind, yielding, beauty. A poet's nature is but frail:—alass, What whip or spur can keep us to our duty! Priests I respect, when they respect do merit, But to their faults I shew not any love. Let them be learn'd, possess a generous spirit, And pious be;—who then will not approve? To thee, great priest, my verse I dedicate, And should it have the happy fate, Thy taste to please; thy future laureat I Will make thy praise resound beyond the sky. What royal pension'd poet can do more! Freely this verse extends thy name, And mighty fame, Further than Afric's distant shore, Or Morven's dreary coast, where mountains high do tow'r. His post when good Erasmus honourably fill'd, By every man it then was thought, That priests, who others taught, Should be themselves in learning somewhat skill'd. But now the scene seems chang'd; and any paltry wight, Who can just read, and cannot write, O shameful! may the Church invade; The priesthood's made a farce; religion's made a trade. See from the army the deserter comes, And mounts the pulpit;—horrid to behold! But still more horrid! see the man of wealth, Who has ordination got by stealth, Put on the gown, and eager seize the gold! Thus men religion sell!—to them naught's evil: They'd even sell themselves unto the Devil, Would he but give a proper price; And in this thing they'd not be over nice; But soon a bargain would be made.— Such dealings are their pleasure;—such their trade! Judas! thou wert by many thought a knave, Yet honest thou compar'd to such a man! Shame that the wretch, to paltry wealth a slave, Should, licensed, rob the Church, and glory in the plan! How bold, and much more honest, are the men, Who scorning such a crafty part to act; Nor do the sacred name of priest defile, To hide their guilt, and clothe their guile, But openly and boldly do the fact; And rob the Church, as thieves by night Break in a house, and rob and steal downright. These then are bold:—in sin they do not falter; Nor do they slily say; don't fear, My coat is black like yours, and piety brought me here. Sly rogues! who dare to use religion's name, That they may rob the Church, and thus may hide their shame. If those poor rogues are hang'd;—oh! how these want the halter. When Churches are thus bad supported under, Well may the steeples crack, and tumble down. Well may they in their anger burst asunder, To see themselves the jest of every clown! But, Boram, I don't call you one of these: The university I know full well Was honour'd by thee; and the bell For dinner that so sweetly chimes, When hungry students after labour great, As well as reading, love sometimes to eat, Was rung by thee, and rung so many times. But as to Latin harsh, and Greek more dull, We know with these thou never plagu'dst thy skull; But when the bell was left at ease, We know among the mighty great, The cook and scullion of the college, From whom thou reapest much important knowledge, Thou us'dst to sit in friendly tête á tête. But, Boram, could you write, it would be better, A shocking thing it is, and gives me pain, That naughty scribblers dare to send a letter, And you, good man, not send them one again. As Trustler, honest man, to make poor persons easy, Who cannot sermons write, and help the lazy, A 'factory keeps where sermons soon are made; (Wholesale and retail too's his trade,) Where any idle parson in the nation, May suit himself for any occasion; Whatever too may be his station, He'll sermons find, and cut to every fashion. So can't you on some handy author hit Who'll teach you how to write your letters? Thus you'll gain credit for your wit, And teach all saucy rascals how to know their betters. Then too your servants you need not invite, To help you out, when you yourself can't write. Nor need you, like a flogg'd child, puling cry, See, gentlemen, see, how such a man I Am served by every wicked creature;— See what bad letters I receive;— I know you never will believe, That I, who live at B? house, Am made to tremble every feature, Just as a cat does terrify a mouse. And that by any wicked wight, Who takes his pen, and dares to write. But lo! the scene is changed! see the great man at study, Rubbing his pate as 'tho' a little muddy, Or else to shew the working of his brains, That like the mountain, as the fables go, When once in labour great, Striving to do some mighty feat. But after all its heavy pains, Brought forth a tiny creeping mouse. Thus Boram strove to astonish all the house, By this unusual and surprising work. See, see, oh wonderful! his eyes upon a book; Not even Newton more intent could look; The wonders of the sky when trying to unravel, Or following a comet in its travel! Bacon of yore you might have thought it was, Striving to make a head brass Speak and be civil: Only that wicked sprite the Devil Or fate contrived it, for 'tis said, He look'd himself much like a brazen-head. He rings the bell; his servants all attend, And crowd into the room of state, Where Boram, like a mighty censor, sat: And first with low humility they bend. Obeisance made; with due respect and fear They sit; the dictates of their lord to hear. Thus have I seen in pantry, hall, or entry, Grimalkin o'er a mouse-hole standing sentry. With watching eye, and with attentive air She sits;—so still, she does not move a hair. Listening of a poor mouse to hear the breath, Then, cruel, sends it to the realms of death. Such and so still the gaping audience sat, To hear the priest begin the great debate. Fear and attention occupi'd them all;— Did a pin drop; you'd plainly hear it fall. Toby sat first; with fearful looking eye He view'd his master, as though dreading evil: Trembling lest he some monster soon should spy, Thinking the priest was going to raise the Devil. For Toby oft had heard it said That learned men could raise the dead! Such power o'er Satan had,—oh mighty thing! They'd make him dance a hornpipe in a ring. And had he seen the chalk but on the table, To keep his seat poor Toby 'd not be able! No wonder than he sat with staring eye; And scarcely kept his breeches dry. ? ? ?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BUT siste, gentle reader, siste; or in plain English I must beg you to stop. I am determined not to ride my Pegasus too fast the first journey. Good horse-men, you know as well as I do, always say, that your first stage should be short, that your horse, in the technical phrase, may find his legs, and may come gradually to his wind. Here then with your leave we will bate; and, like sociable travellers, talk over the next stage, and examine the road we mean to take when we again mount our steed. I have thus far then (to use a less metaphorical language) proceeded with my hero's story, and before I continue it any further, I am determined to hear what the world says of it; and whether they are pleased with the novel character which I have presented to them. If the publick approve, I perhaps shall in a short time finish the story which I sketched out in the argument.—In the mean time as Alexander thought Achilles highly honoured in having Homer for his poet, who has made his name immortal; so will it be thought that the hero of this tale ought to hold himself obliged in no small degree to Anthony Pasquin for rescuing from oblivion the many singular actions, which have distinguished him from the multitude, and which, but for him, would soon have been lost and forgotten. In the mean time, as the faithful historian of his life, I expect to receive from him no small thanks for my labour.—Here then, good reader, we will conclude the first part of this poem The reader may be assured that when Pasquin writes again, he will have a more important hero, and more interesting matter to write upon.—He is, in real truth, asham'd of his present subject, and wishes that he had not condescended even in this manner to notice it.—He does not know however that he ought to be ashamed of it. A poet ought to be a moralist. To instruct mankind was the first design of poetry.—According as the characters are, so must the instruction be adapted. To solid minds, serious arguments is proper to be offered. To shallow minds ridicule; thus true is the assertion of Horace,“Ridiculum acri Fortiús et meliùs magnas plerumque secat res.” Hor. Lib. 1. Sat. x. V. 14.. As to the title of it whether it be heroic, or not, this matter I shall leave to be settled by the learned critics of this and succeeding ages. Dryden objected to Milton's Poem being heroic, because the Devil, as he said, was his hero See his Dedication of the Æneid, p. 96.. If such an objection be started against mine, I cannot help it. I would only beg leave to suggest, that if a poem contains all that Aristotle (who is always chair-man on these occasions) thinks necessary to constitute an Epic, the person of the hero can be of no consequence at all. But as I promised to present my readers with a pretty little ode upon another subject, I will here give it them. If any surly critics should say, that I have shewed no tenderness for my hero, I reply, that I have intended, (contrary indeed to the practice of all other poets) not to deal in fiction, but to keep to real life. I was therefore obliged on this account to paint and describe according to the circumstances which were presented to me. Had I been left to my own discretion, I should, most probably, have drawn a veil over some things:—but then I should not have been a faithful historian: a character I wish much to preserve.—And in the next place the following ode will, I hope, fully prove the tenderness of my feelings, whenever I have a subject on which I can display them. Permit it to be ushered into your presence by the following introduction. INTRODUCTION. [Should any dare to say, that I am cruel] Should any dare to say, that I am cruel; Hard-hearted, an unfeeling creature, And treat a man as though he lived on gruel, And had not a fine house above his head, And slept on straw instead of a fine bed; And of the human kind had not a single feature. Pasquin replies, that such fine things may do To make small people great, who have nought else to shew. But put a peacock's feathers on a crow, And it may startle such as don't his worship know. But those who call me cruel, tell a lie, As with your mighty leave I soon will prove. Pray read this little ode, and see if I Am not possess'd of all the warmth of love. ODE TO ELIZA. “Me retinent vinctum formosae vincla puellae, Et sedeo duras janitor ante fores.” Tibull. Eleg. Lib. 1. El. 1. V. 55. “Quam juvat immites ventos audire cubantem, Et dominam tenero continuisse sinu: Aut, gelidas hibernus aquas cum fuderit auster, Securum somnos imbre juvante sequi! Hoc mihi contingat.—” Ibid. V. 41. “Cum das Basia, nectaris, Neæra! Das mî pocula, das dapes Deorum.” Buchanan. ODE. Those eyes “??? ??? ???????? ?????? ??? ??????? ?????, ??? ? ??? ????????? ?????, ???? ??? ? ??? ????????.” Chrysostom. De Sacerdotio, lib. vi. p. 250, ed. Hughes, that sweet attractive air, That face with every charm o'erspread;— That look!—Eliza, these declare You was not born to die a maid. Come then, sweet girl, whilst in thy prime, Come while the graces round you play; Indulge in love!—O! seize the time; Beauty is frail, and will decay “Interea, dum fata sinunt, jungamus amores. Jam veniet tenebris mors adoperta caput. Jam subrepet iners ætas, nec amare decebit, Dicere nec cano blanditias capite. Nunc levis est tractanda Venus, dum frangere postes Non pudet, et rixas inseruisse juvat.” Tibull: Eleg: Lib 1. El. 1. V. 83.. O could I but possess those charms, And on that throbbing bosom lie! Could I, encircl'd in those arms, In pleasure and in rapture die! Such fond ideas in my mind, And wandering fancy often play; Oft-times I paint thee soft and kind:— But these like phantoms pass away. Come, charming girl, come, realize, And make these visions prove but true: Come let me taste substantial joys;— Such joys as flow from love and you. Why with such lustre shine those eyes; And why that face such power display! Such charms, resistless! why arise, And thousand graces round you play! Those hills of snow, of purest white, That heaving tempt the daring hand; Ambrosial lips which love invite;— Ah! these, Eliza, who can stand! But there are charms that hidden lie, Far from the reach of mortal sight; Where eyes profane must never pry, Nor view those regions of delight! Eliza! were I with thee blest; Were I such treasures but enjoying!— To clasp thee to this eager breast; Soft, tender, yielding, melting,—dying! Ye gods, that in Olympus high, Indulge in sweets of heavenly love! I'd envy not your bliss and joy, Nor want your Venus from above. More than Elysian bliss I'd share While you, dear girl, prov'd true and kind; “Non dat basia, dat Neæra nectar, Dat rores animæ suave-olentes.” Johannes Secundus Nicolaius. Basium iv. And, oh! could aught that bliss impair, While thought meets thought, and mind unites with mind! With eager warmth those lips I'd press; With equal warmth the kiss return'd:— Of pleasure sure 'twould be the excess:— Sappho with equal fire ne'er burn'd! “Donce pressiùs incubo labellis, Et diduco avidus tuæ, puella, Flosculos animæ suave-olentes; Unus tum videor mihi deorum, Seu quid altiùs est beautiùsve.” Bonefonii Basium xvi. But, oh! my muse give o'er thy lay: Dull prudes will chide your amorous strains; Whose souls, unchear'd by passion's ray, Are held in winter's icy chains. But you, my girl, who charm each sense, Forgive the verse inspir'd by you. My muse would never give offence:— Eliza, dearest girl, adieu. FINIS.</field>
