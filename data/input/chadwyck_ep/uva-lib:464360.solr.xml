      <field name="fulltext">THE MINDE OF THE FRONTISPEECE, And Argument of this Worke. Fire, Aire, Earth, VVater, all the Opposites That stroue in Chaos, powrefull Love vnites; And from their Discord drew this Harmonie, Which smiles in Nature: who, with rauisht eye, Affects his owne made Beauties. But, our Will, Desire, and Powres Jrascible, the skill Of Pallas orders; who the Mind attires With all Heroick Vertues: This aspires To Fame and Glorie; by her noble Guide Eternized, and well-nigh Deifi'd. But who forsake that faire Jntelligence, To follow Passion, and voluptuous Sense; That shun the Path and Toyles of Hercvles; Such, charm'd by Circe's luxurie, and ease, Themselues deforme: 'twixt whom, so great an ods; That these are held for Beasts, and those for Gods. Phœbvs Apollo (sacred Poesy) Thus taught: for in these ancient Fables lie The mysteries of all Philosophie. Some Natures secrets shew; in some appeare Distempers staines; some teach vs how to beare Both Fortunes, bridling Ioy, Griefe, Hope, and Feare. These Pietie, Deuotion those excite; These prompt to Vertue, those from Vice affright; All fitly minging Profit with Delight. This Course our Poet steeres: and those that faile, By wandring stars, not by his Compasse, saile. A Panegyricke to the King. To the most High and Mightie Prince Charles, King of Great Britaine, France, and Ireland. —Materiæ respondet Musa.— Ioue, whose transcendent Acts the Poets sing, By Men made more then Man, is found a King: Whose Thunder and ineuitable Flame, His Iustice and maiestick Awe proclaime: His chearfull Influence, and refreshing Showers, Mercy and Bounty; Marks of heauenly Powers. These, free from Ioues disorders, blesse thy Raigne; And might restore the golden Age againe, Jf all men, by thy great Example lead, Would that prepared way to Vertue tread. Rare Cures, deepe Prophesies, harmonious Layes, Insphear'd Apollo; crown'd with Wisdomes Raies. Thy onely touch can heale: Thou, to thy State, The better Genius, Oracle, and Fate: The Poets Theame and Patron; who at will Canst adde t' Augustus Scepter Maro's Quill. Our Worlds cleare Eye, thy Cynthia, euer bright: When neerest thee, displayes her fairest light: May her exalted Rayes for euer ioyne In a beneuolent Aspect with thyne! Not Cupids wild-fiers, but those Beames which dart From Venus purer Spheare, inflame thy hart. Minerua's Oliue prospers in thy Land: And Neptunes Ocean stoopes to thy Commaund. Like Bacchus thy fresh Youth, and free Delights; Not as disguised in his frantick Rites: Such, as when he, with Phœbus, takes his seate On sacred Nisa; and with quickning heate Inspires the Muses. Thou, our Mercury, From shades infernall, wretches, doom'd to dy, Restor'st to light: thy prudent Snakes asswage Hell-norisht Discord, and Warres bloody Rage: Thy Zeale to many Mercuries giues wing, Who heauenly Embasyes to Mortals bring: Thy Uigilance secure Repose imparts; Yet build'st no Counsels on his subtil Artes. Those old Heroes with their Heroines, Who spangled all the firmament with Signes, Shut out succeeding worthies; scarce could spare A little roome for Berenices Haire. Great Iulius, who their Gods transcended farre, Could rise no higher then a Blazing-starre. Others, whom after Ages most admire, At Comets catch, or Starres new set on fire; Which, though Ætheriall, see not their euent: So soone, like sublunary Glories, spent! These, whose Aspects gaue lawes to Destiny, Before the luster of the Day starre fly: Their lights prou'd erring Fiers, their Jnfluence vaine; And nothing but their empty Names remaine. Those last immortaliz'd, whose dying breath Pronounc'd them Men, created Gods by Death; Whom fragrant Flames, Ioues Eagles, Periuries, And Popular Applause, raisd to the Skies; Downe shot like Falling starres: more transitory In their Diuine, then in their Humane Glory. These, as the first, bold Flattery deifi'd: Thou, to whom Heauen that title hath apply'd, Shalt by Humility, a Grace vnknowne To their Ambition, gaine a heauenly Throne. Enough my Muse: Time shall a Poet raise, Borne vnder better starres, to sing his Praise. Urania to the Queene. The Muses, by your fauour blest, Faire Queene inuite you to their Feast. The Graces will reioyce, and sue, Since so excel'd, to waite on you. Ambrosia tast, which frees from Death; And Nectar, fragrant as your breath, By Hebe fill'd; who states the Prime Of Youth, and brailes the winges of Time. Here in Adonis Gardens grow, What nether Age nor winter know. The Boy, with whom Loue seem'd to dy, Bleeds in this pale Anemony. Selfe-lou'd Narcissus in the Myrror Of your faire eyes, now sees his error; And from the flattering Fountaine turnes. The Hyacinth no longer mournes. This Heliotrope, which did pursue Th' adored Sun, conuerts to you. These Statues touch, and they agen Will from cold marble change to men. Chast Daphne bends her virgin boughs, And twines to imbrace your sacred browes. Their tops the Paphian Myrtles moue; Saluting you their Queene of Loue. Myrrha, who weepes for her offence, Presents her teares; her Frankinsence Leucothoë; the Heliades Their Amber: yet you need not these. They all retaine their sence, and throng To heare the Thracian Poets Song. How would they, should you sing, admire! Neglect his skill! as he his Lyre! Contending Nightingals, strucke mute, Drop downe, and dy vpon your Lute! The Phœnix, from the glowing East, With sweetes here builds her Tombe and Nest: Another Phœnix seene, shee dyes; Burnt into ashes by your eyes; This Swan, which in Peneus swims, His Funerall songs conuerts to Hymnes. These azure-plum'd Halcyones, Whose Birth controules the raging Seas, To your sweete Vnion yeild the praise Of Nuptial loues; of Peacefull Dayes. Nymph, take this Quiuer, and this Bow: Diana such in shape and show; When with her starr-like traine shee crownes Eurotas bancks, or Cynthus Downes. There, chace the Calydonian Bore: Here see Actæon fly before His eger Hounds. Wild Heards will stand At gaze; nor feare so faire a hand. There be, who our Delights despise, As Shaddowes, and vaine Phantasies. Those Sons of Earth, inthrald to sense, Condemne what is our Excellence. The Aire, Immortall Soules, the Skyes, The Angels in their Hyrarchies; Vnseene, to all things seene dispense Breath, Life, Protection, Influence. Our high Conceptions craue a Minde From Earth, and Ignorance refin'd: Crowne Vertue; Fortunes pride controule; Raise Obiects, equall to the Soule: At will create; eternity Bestow on mortals, borne to dy. Yet we, who life to others giue, Faire Queene, would by your fauour liue. OVIDS Metamorphosis The first Booke. The Argvment. The World, form'd out of Chaos. Man is made. The Ages change. The Giants Heaven invade. Earth turnes their blood to men. Ioue's flames confound Lycaon, now a Wolfe. The World is drown'd. Man-kind, cast stones restore. All quickning Earth Renewes the rest, and giues new Monsters birth. Apollo, Python kills; heart-wounded, loues Lust-flying Daphne: Shee a Lawrell proues. Ioue, Iö made a Cow, to maske foule deeds. Hermes, a Heardsman. Syrinx, chang'd to Reeds, Dead Argu's eyes adorne the Peacocks traine. The Cow, to Iö, Ioue transformes againe. Of bodies chang'd to other shapes I sing. Assist, you Gods (Nam vos mutastis &amp; illas) Ordo. Nam &amp; vos mutastis illas. Virg. Timeo Danaus &amp; dona ferentes. Mimme vero (inquit Regius) imperitorum quorundam expositio est admittenda; Nam mutastis vos &amp; illas: quo quidem modo ex eleganti sensus insulsus efficeretur. Periret enim illa emphasis pulchra, quæ per copulam Et aperte demonstratur. Hac au em expositione omnet, non Deorum solum sed aliarum quoq, rerum transmutationes comprehenduntur. Sic &amp; Pontanus. (from you these changes spring) And, from the Worlds first fabrick The raigne of Augustus. to these times, Deduce my never-discontinued Rymes. The Sea, the Earth, all-covering Heaven vnfram'd, One face had Nature, which they Chaos nam'd: Chaos. An vndigested lump; a barren load, Where jarring seeds of things ill-joyn'd aboad. No The Sunne, of his supposed mother Titæa, whose 45. children were called Titans. Titan yet the world with light adornes; Nor waxing The Moone; as Phœbus the Sunne, in regard of their brightnesse, said to haue hornes from the figure of her Crescent. Phœbe fill'd her wained hornes: Nor hung the selfe-poiz'd Earth in thin Ayre plac'd; Nor The daughter of Oceanus and wife to Neptune, here taken for the Sea. Amphitrite the vast shore imbrac'd. With Earth, was Ayre and Sea: the Earth vnstable, The Ayre was darke, the Sea vn-navigable: No certaine forme to any one assign'd: This, that resists. For, in one body joyn'd, The Cold and Hot, the Drie and Humid fight; The Soft and Hard, the Heavie with the Light. But God, the better Nature, this decides: Who Earth from Heaven, the Sea from earth divides: The 4 Elements. And purer Heaven extracts from grosser Ayre. All which vnfolded by his prudent care From that blind Masse; the happily dis-joyn'd With strifelesse peace He to their seats confin'd. Forth-with vp-sprung the quick and waightlesse Fire, Whose flames vnto the highest Arch aspire: The next, in levitie and place, is Ayre: Grosse Elements to thicker Earth repayre Selfe-clog'd with waight: the Waters flowing round, Possesse the last, and solid The earth, or Goddesse thereof. Tellus bound. The Earth adorned.What God soeuer this division wrought, And euery part to due proportion brought; First, least the Earth vnequall should appeare, He turn'd it round, in figure of a Spheare; Then, Seas diffus'd; commanding them to roare With ruffling Winds, and giue the Land a shore. To those he addeth Springs, Ponds, Lakes immense; And Riuers, whom their winding borders fence: Of these, not few Earth's thirsty jawes devoure; The rest, their streams into the Ocean poure; When, in that liquid Plaine, with freer waue, The foamie Cliffes, in stead of Banks, they laue: Bid's Trees increase to Woods, the Plaines extend, The rocky Mountaynes rise, and Vales descend. The 5 Zones.Two equall So called of compassing the Heauens like girdles. Zones, on either side, dispose The measur'd Heauens; a fifth, more hot then those. As many Lines th'included Globe divide: I'th' midst vnsufferable beams reside; Snow clothes the other two: the temperate hold 'Twixt these their seats, the Heat well mixt with Cold. The Description of the ayre.As Earth, as Water, vpper Ayre out-waighs; So much doth Ayre Fire's lighter balance raise. There, He commands the changing Clouds to stray; There, thundering terrors mortall mindes dismay; And with the Lightning, Winds ingendring Snow: Yet not permitted every way to blow; Who hardly now to teare the World refraine ( The sonns of the Giant Astræus and Aurora.So Brothers jarre!) though they divided raigne, To Persis and Sabbæa, A name of a Westerne wind in that it blowes from the Orient: Persis and Sabæa lying East from Italy. Eurus flies; Whose gums perfume the blushing Mornes vp-rise: Next to the Evening, and the Coast that glowes With setting Phœbus, flowrie The West wind importing a nourisher of life; for all vegitables by the temperature thereof more luxuriously prosper. Zeph'rus blowes: In Scythia horrid The North wind: so called of his blustring. Boreas holds his raigne, Beneath A Constellation, neare the Articke Circle, which seems to follow the Northerne waine; and takes his name from the driuing of oxen. Boötes and the Seauen starres that wheele about the North Pole, and are disposed in that forme. frozen Waine: The Land to this oppos'd, doth The Southerne wind; and signifies an attraction of water, in that commonly accompanied with raine. Auster steepe With fruitfull showres, and clouds which ever weepe. The heavens and their contents.Aboue all these he plac't the liquid Skies; Which, void of earthly dregs, did highest rise. Scarce had He all thus orderly dispos'd; When as the Starres their radiant heads disclos'd (Long hid in Night) and shone through all the skie. Then, that no place should vnpossessed lie, Bright Constellations, and faire figured Gods, In heauenly Mansions fixt their blest abodes: The glittering Fishes to the Flouds repayre; The Beasts to Earth, the Birds resort to Ayre. Man Created.The nobler Creature, with a mind possest, Was wanting yet, that should command the rest. That Maker, the best World's originall, Either Him fram'd of seed Cælestiall; Or Earth, which late he did from Heauen diuide, Some sacred seeds retain'd, to Heauen ally'd: Which with the liuing streame Prometheus mixt; And in that artificiall structure fixt The forme of all th'all-ruling Deities. And whereas others see with downe-cast eyes, He with a loftie looke did Man indue, And bade him heauens transcendent glories view. So, that rude Clay, which had no forme afore, Thus chang'd, of Man the vnknowne figure bore. The Golden Age was first; which vncompeld, The 4 Ages. And without rule, in faith and Truth exceld.

O what a heart wouldst thou haue had, if Fate Had ta'ne me from thee, and prolong'd thy date! So wild a feare, such sorrowes, so forlorne And comfortlesse, how couldest thou haue borne! If Seas had suckt thee in, I would haue follow'd My Wife in death, and Sea should me haue swallow'd. O would I could my Prometheus, who made man of Earth. Father's cunning vse!

Then, humbly on their faces prostrate lay'd, And kissing the cold stones, with feare thus pray'd. If Powres diuine to iust desires consent, And angrie Gods doe in the end relent; Say, Themis, how shall wee our Race repaire? O, helpe the drown'd in Water and Despaire! The Goddesse, with compassion mou'd, reply'd; Goe from my Temple: both your faces hide; Let Garments all vnbraced loosely flow; And your Great-Parents bones behind you throw. Amaz'd! first Pyrrha silence breakes, and said; By me the Goddesse must not be obay'd; And, trembling, pardon craues: Superstitious antiquity supposed that the Soule could not be at rest if the body were vnburied, or otherwise disturbed.

Epimethida Thus recollecteth; lost in her dismay: Or I the Oracle misse vnderstand, Or the iust Gods no wicked thing command, The Earth is our Great-Mother: and the stones, Therein cotain'd, I take to be her bones.

Both with weake faith rely On ayding Heauen. What hurt was it to try? Departing with heads vail'd, and clothes vnbrac't, Commanded stones they o're their shoulders cast. Did not Antiquitie auouch the same, Who would beleeu't! the stones lesse hard became. And as their naturall hardnesse them forsooke; So by degrees they Man's dimensions tooke; And gentler-natur'd grew, as they increast: And, yet not manifestly Man exprest; But, like rough-hewne rude marble Statues stand, That want the Workmans last life-giuing hand. The Earthy parts, and what had any iuyce, Were both converted to the body's vse. The vnflexible and solid, turne to bones: The veins remain, that were when they were stones. Those, throwne by Man, the forme of men indue: And those were Women, which the Woman threw. Hence we, a hardy Race, inur'd to payne: Our Actions our Originall explayne. All other Creatures tooke their numerous birth And figures, from the voluntary Earth. When that old humor with the Sunne did sweat, And slimy Marishes grew big with heat; The pregnant Seeds, as from their Mothers wombe, From quickning Earth both growth and forme assume. So, Nilus for a part of the Summer surrounds all Ægypt; beginning to rise with the rising Sun on the 17. of Iune: about the midle of September it ceaseth to augment; and in the midst of October retires within his channells. when seuen chanel'd Nile forsakes the Playne, When ancient bounds retyring streames contayne, And late-left slime æthereall feruours burne, Men various creatures with the gleabe vp-turne: Of those, some in their very time of birth; Some lame; and others halfe aliue, halfe earth. For, Heat and Moysture, when they temperate grow, Forth-with conceiue; and life on things bestow. From striuing Fire and Water all proceede; Discording Concord euer apt to breede.

Which way so-ere he stands, he Iö spyes: Iö, behind him, was before his eyes. By day, she graz'd abroad: The Sunne. Sol vnder ground, He hous'd her, in vnworthy halter bound.

Who low'd, when shee began to make her mone; And trembled at the voyce which was her owne. Vnto the bankes of Inachus she stray'd; Her Fathers banks, where shee so oft had playd: Beholding in his streame her horned head, Shee starts; and from her selfe, selfe-frighted, fled.

He brought her Grasse: She gently lickt his hands, And kist his palmes; nor, longer, teares withstands. And had shee then had words, shee had display'd Her Name, her Fortunes, and implor'd his ayde. For words, The impression of a Cowes foote resembles an I in the midst of an O. But Inachus by this could not distinguish his Daughter from others: rather shee writ her name with her foot, as retaining her reason. shee letters with her foot imprest Vpon the Sand, which her sad change profest. Wo's me! cry'd Inachus; his armes he throwes About her snowy Necke. O, woe of woes!

Her body more then meager; pale her hew; Her teeth all rustie; still shee looks askew; Her breast with gall, her tongue with poyson sweld: Shee only laught, when she sad sights beheld. Her ever-waking cares exil'd soft sleepe: Who lookes on good successe, with eyes that weepe; Repining, pines: who, wounding others, bleeds: And on her selfe revengeth her misdeeds. Although Pallas: of the Lake Triton, where first shee was seene in her warlike habiliments; or rather of her wisdome. Tritonia did the Hag detest; Yet briefely thus her pleasure she exprest: Aglauros, one of the Daughters of Cecrops. Cecropides, Doe thou infest with thy accurst disease. This said; the hastie Goddesse doth advance Her body, with her earth-repelling lance. Envie cast after her a wicked eye, Mutters, and could for very sorrow die That such her power: a snaggy staffe then tooke Wreathed with thornes; and her darke Caue forsooke. Wrapt in black clouds, which way so ere shee turnes, The Corne she lodges, flowrie pastures burnes, Crops what growes high; Townes, Nations, with her breath Pollutes; and Vertue persecutes to death. When shee the faire Athenian towres beheld, Which so in wealth, in learned Arts exceld, And feastfull Peace; to crie she scarce forbeares, In that she saw no argument for teares. When shee Aglauros lodging entred had, Shee gladly executes what Pallas bade: Her cankred hand vpon her brest she lai'd, And crooked thornes into her heart convay'd, And breath'd in bainefull poyson; which she sheads Into her bones, and through her spirits spreads. And that her envy might not want a cause; The God in his divinest forme shee drawes: And with it, sets before her wounded eyes Her happy sister, and their nuptiall ioyes: Augmenting all. These secret woes excite, And gnaw her soule. Shee sighs all day, all night; And with a slow infection melts away, Like Ice before the Sunnes vncertaine ray. Faire Herse's happy state such heart-burne breeds In her black bosome, as when spiny weeds Are set on fire: which without flame consume, And seeme (so small their heat) to burne with fume. Oft shee resolues to die, such sights to shun: Oft, by disclosing, to haue both vndone. Now sits she on the threshold, to prevent The Gods accesse; who with lost blandishment, And his best Art, perswades. Quoth shee; forbeare, I cannot be remou'd, if you stay here. I to this bargaine, he reply'd, will stand; The figured doore then forces with His Caduceus. his wand. Striuing to rise, to second her debate, Her hips could not remoue, prest with dull waight. Againe shee struggl'd to haue stood on end: But, those vnsupple sinewes would not bend. Incroaching cold now enters at her nayles: And lack of blood her veines blew branches pale's. And as a Canker, slighting helplesse Arts, Creeps from th'infected to the sounder parts: So by degrees the winter of wan Death Congeales the path of life, and stops her breath: Nor stroue she: had she stroue to make her mone, Voice had no way; her neck and face now stone. There shee a bloodlesse Statue sate, all freckt: Her spotted minde the Marble did infect. Evropa. When Mercury: of Atlas, the father of his mother. Atlantiades, on her, prophane Of tongue and heart, this sharp revenge had ta'ne; He from Athens: See the Comment on the sixth booke. the Cittie, nam'd by Pallas, flew On mounting wings, and vnto heauen with-drew. With whom, Ioue thus (his loue concealing) ioynes: Thou, faithfull Minister to my designes, Shoot swiftly through the Ayre vnto A part of Phœnicia, which Maia the mother of Mercury, one of the Pleiades, behold from the South. that Land, Whose borders North-ward of thy Mother stand, Which those Inhabitants Sidonia name: Behold, you royall Heard: conduct the same, From not farre distant Mountaines, to the shore. This he dispatcht, with speed that went before A humane thought. There, oft the Europa, the daughter of King Agenor. princely Maid, Accompany'd with Tyrian Virgins, play'd. Loue and high Majestie agree not well; Nor will together in one bosome dwell. That Powre, from whom, what-ere hath being, springs; That King of Gods, who three-fork't lightning flings; Whose nod the World's vnfixt foundation shakes, The figure of a sensuall Bull now takes: And, lowing, walkes vpon the tender grasse Amongst the Heard; though he in forme surpasse. His colour whiter then vntroden snow, Before still-moist and thawing The South Wind. Auster blow. The flesh, in swelling rowles, adornes his neck: His broad-spread brest, long dangling dew-laps deck. His hornes, though small, yet such as Art invite To imitate, then shining gemmes more bright: His eyes no wrath, his browes no terror threat; His whole aspect with smiling peace repleat. The beast, Europa. Agenor's daughter doth admire, So wondrous beautifull, so void of ire. Though such, at first shee his approach did dread, Yet forthwith toucht; and then with flowres him fed. The Louer joyes: till he his hopes might feast, He kist her hands; ah, scarce deferres the rest! Now, on the springing grasse, he frisks and playes: His sides now on the golden sands he layes. Her feare subdu'd, shee strokes his profferd brest: Her Virgin-hands his hornes with garlands drest. The royall Maid, who now no courage lackt, Ascends the Bull, not knowing whom shee backt. He, to the Sea approaching, by degrees First dips therein his hoofes, anon his knees; Then, rushing forward, beares away the prize. Shee shreeks, and to the shore reverts her eyes: One hand his horne, the other held behind; Her lighter garments swelling with the wind. The Third Booke. The Argvment. Arm'd troops from Dragons late-sowne teeth arise. By his owne Hounds the Hart Actæon dies. Iuno a Beldame. Semele doth frie In wisht imbraces. Bacchus from Ioues thigh Takes second birth. The wise Tiresias twice Doth change his sex. Scorn'd Eccho pines t' a voice: Selfe-lou'd Narcissus to a Daffadill. Bacchus, a Boy. The Tyrrhen's ship stands still, With Ivy mor'd. Strange shapes the Saylers fright: Who Dolphines turne, and still in ships delight. And now the God, arriuing with his Rape At sacred Creet, resumes his heauenly shape, The King, Cadmus. his sonne to seeke his daughter sent, Fore-doomed to perpetuall banishment, Except his fortune to his wish succeed: How pious, and how impious in one deed! Earth wandred-through (Ioues thefts who can exquire?) Cadmvs. He shunnes his Country, and his Fathers ire: With Phœbus Oracle consults, to know What Land the Fates intended to bestow. Who, thus: In desert fields obserue a Cow, Yet never yoakt, nor servile to the plow: Follow her slowe conduct: and where she shall Repose, there build: the place Bœotias was the name of the Country, but Thebes of the Citty which was built by Cadmus: either of them in their severall languages signifying an Oxe. Bœötia call. Scarce Cadmus from A Caue in Parnassus where Apollo gaue Oracles, adioyning to the Fountaine. Castalian Caue descended, When he a Heifer saw, by no man tended, Her neck vngall'd with groaning servitude. The God ador'd, he foot by foot persew'd. A River of Bœotia. Cephisus flood, and A Citty of Phocis. Panope now past, Shee made a stand; to heauen her fore-head cast, With loftie hornes most exquisitely faire; Then, with repeated lowings fill'd the ayre: Lookes back vpon the company she led; And, kneeling, makes the tender grasse her bed. The Ancient supposed that every country and particular place had their tutelar Genius; which they accustomed to worship at their entrance and departure.Thanks-giuing Cadmus kist the vnknowne ground; The stranger fields and hills saluting round. About to sacrifice to heauen's high King, He sends for water from the liuing Spring. A Wood there was, which never Axe did hew; In it, a Caue, where Reeds and Osiers grew, Rooft with a rugged Arch by Nature wrought; With pregnant waters plentifully fraught. The lurking See the Comment. Snake of Mars this Hold possest; Bright scal'd, and shining with a golden crest; His bulk with poyson swolne; fire-red his eyes: Three darting tongues, three ranks of teeth comprise. This fatall Well th' vnlucky Tyrians found; Who with their down-let Pitcher, rays'd a sound. With that, the Serpent his blew head extends; And suffering ayre with horrid hisses rends. The water from them fell: their colour fled: Who all, astonisht, shook with sudden dread. He wreaths his scaly foldes into a heape; And fetcht a compasse with a mighty leape: Then, bolt-vpright his monstrous length displaies More then halfe way; and all the Woods survaies. Whose body, when all seene, no lesse appeares, Extending towards the South from the North with many flexures like a mighty River; consisting of 31 starrs.Then that, which parts the two Cœlestiall Beares. Whether the Tyrians sought to fight, or flie, Or whether they through feare could neither trie; Some crasht he 'twixt his iawes; some claspt to death; Some kills with poyson; others with his breath. And now the Sunne the shortest shadowes made; Then, Cadmus, wondring why his servants stai'd, Their foot-steps trac't. A hide the Heroe wore, Which late he from a slaughtred Lyon tore: His Armes a dart, a bright steele-pointed Speare; And such a minde as could not stoope to feare. When he the Wood had entred, and there view'd The bodies of the slaine with blood imbrew'd; The insulting Victor quenching his dire thirst And their suckt wounds; he sigh't, as heart would burst: Then said, I will revenge, ô faithfull Mates, Your murders, or accompany your Fates. With that he lifteth vp a mightie stone, Which with a more then manly force was throwne. What would haue batter'd downe the strongest wall, And shiuered towres, doth giue no wound at all. The hardnesse of his skin, and scales that growe Vpon his armed back, repulse the blowe. And yet that strong defence could not so well The vigour of his thrilling Dart repell; Which through his winding back a passage rends: There sticks: the steele into his guts descends. Rabid with anguish, he retorts his looke Vpon the wound; and then the jauelin tooke Betweene his teeth; it every way doth winde: At length, tugg'd out, yet leaues the head behind. His rage increast with his augmenting paines: And his thick-panting throte swels with full veines. A cold white froth surrounds his poys'nous jawes: On thundring Earth his trayling scales he drawes: Who from his black and Poysonous: such as the water of that infernall River; or of Styx the Arcadian fountaine, which nothing could containe but the hoofe of an Asse. Stygian maw eiect's A blasting breath, which all the ayre infect's. His body, now he circularly bends; Forth-with into a monstrous length extends: Then rusheth on, like showr-incensed Floods; And with his brest ore-beares the obvious Woods. The Prince gaue way; who with the Lyon's spoyle Sustayn'd th' assault; and forc't a quick recoile, His Lance fixt in his jawes. What could not feele, He madly wounds; and bites the biting steele. Th' invenom'd gore, which from his palate bled, Converts the grasse into a duskie red: Yet, slight the hurt, in that the Snake with-drew; And so, by yeelding, did the force subdue. Till Cadmus the son of Agenor. Agenorides the steele imbrew'd In his wide throte, and still his thrust pursu'd; Vntill an Oke his back-retrait with-stood: There, he his neck transfixt: with it, the Wood. The tree bends with a burden so vnknowne; And, lashed by the Serpents taile, doth grone. While he survai'd the hugenesse of his foe, This voice he heard (from whence he did not knowe) Why is that Serpent so admir'd by thee? Agenor's sonne, a Serpent thou shalt bee. He speechlesse grew: pale feare repell'd his blood; And now vncurled haire like bristles stood. Behold! Being both the Goddesse of wisdome and valour: by which men are inabled to subdue all difficulties. mans Fautresse, Pallas (from the sky Descending to his needfull aid) stood by: Who bade him in the turn'd-vp furrowes throwe The Serpents teeth; that future men might growe. He, as commanded, plow'd the patient Earth: And therein sow'd the seeds of humane birth. Lo (past beliefe!) the Clods began to moue: And tops of Lances first appear'd aboue: Then, Helmets, nodding with their plumed Crests; Forth-with, refulgent Pouldrons, plated Brests; Hands, with offensiue weapons charg'd, insew: And Target-bearing troops of Men vp-grew. So in our Theater's solemnities, When they the Arras rayse, the Figures rise: Afore the rest, their faces first appeare; By little and by little then they reare Their bodies, with a measure keeping hand, Vntill their feet vpon the border stand. Bold Cadmus, though much daunted at the sight Of such an Host, addrest him to the fight. Forbeare (a new-borne Souldier cry'd) t' ingage Thy better fortune in our civill rage! With that, he on his Earth-bred brother flew: At whom, a deadly dart another threw. Nor be that kil'd him, long surviues his death; But, through wide wounds expires his infant breath. Slaughter, with equall furie, runnes through all: And by vncivill civill blowes they fall. The new-sprung Youth, who hardly life possest, Now panting, kick their Mother's bloody brest. But fiue suruiu'd: of whom, Echion one; His Armes to Earth by Pallas counsell throwne, He craues the loue he offers. All accord As Brothers should: and what they take afford. Sidonian Cadmus these assist, to build His loftie walls; the Oracle fulfil'd. Now flourisht Thebes: now did thy exile proue In shew a blessing; Cadmus married Hermione the daughter of Mars and Venus. those that rule in loue And warre, thy Nuptials with their daughter grace: By such a Wife to haue so faire a race; So many sonnes and daughters; nephews too (The pledges of their peacefull beds) insue; And they now growne to excellence and powre. But, Man must censur'd be by his last houre: Whom truly we can never happy call, Afore his death, and closing funerall. Actæon.In this thy every way so prosperous state, Thy first misse-hap sprung from thy Actæon, the sonne of Aristaeus by his daughter Antonoe Nephew's fate: Whose browes vnnaturall branches ill adorne; By his vngratefull doggs in peeces torne. Yet fortune did offend in him; not he: For, what offence may in an error be? With purple blood, slaine Deare the Hills imbrew: And now high Noone the shades of things withdrew; While East and West the equall Sunne partake: Thus, then, Actaeon; of the Hyantes, a people of Bœcia. Hyantius to his Partners spake, That trod the Mazes of the pathlesse Wood: My Friends our nets and jauelins reake with blood: Enough hath beene the fortune of this day: To morrow, when Aurora shall display Her rosie cheeks, we may our sports renew. Now, Phœbus, with inflaming eye doth view The crannied Earth: here let our labour end: Take vp your toyles. They gladly condescend. A Vale there was with Pines and Cypresse crown'd, Gargaphie call'd; for Diana's loue renown'd. A shadie Caue possest the inward part, Not wrought by hands; there Nature witty Art Did counterfeit: a natiue Arch she drew, With Pumice and light Tofusses, that grew. A bubbling Pausanias mentions this fountaine; stopt vp by Mardonius in the Persian warre, and a little after restored by the Platæenses. Spring, with streames as cleere as glasse, Ran chiding by, inclos'd with matted grasse. The weary Huntresse vsually here laues Her Virgin lims, more pure then those pure waues. And now her Bowe, her Iau'ling, and her Quiuer; Doth to a Nymph, one of her Squires, deliuer: Her light impouerisht Robes another held: Her buskins two vntie. See the Comment. The better skild Ismenian Crocale, her long haire wound In pleited-wreathes: yet was her owne vnbound. Neat Hayle, Niphe, Rhanis, Psecas (still Imploy'd) and Phiale the Lauers fill. While here Diana; of her Grandmother Titan. Titania bath'd (as was her guise) Lo Cadmus Nephew, tyr'd with exercise, And wandring through the Woods, approacht this Groue With fatall steps: so Destiny him droue! Entring the Caue with skipping Springs bedeaw'd: The Nymphs, all naked, when a man they view'd, Clapt their resounding breasts, and fild the Wood With sudden shreekes: like Iuory pales they stood About their Goddesse: but shee, far more tall, By head and shoulders ouer-tops them all. Such as that colour, which the Clowds adorns, Shot by the Sunne-beam's; or the rosie Morn's: Such flusht in Dians cheeks, being naked tane. And though inviron'd by her Virgin trayne, Shee side-long turnes, looks back, and wisht her bow: Yet, what she had, she in his face did throwe. With vengefull Waters sprinkled; to her rage These words shee addes, which future Fate presage: Now, tell how thou hast seene me disarray'd; Tell if thou canst: I giue thee leaue. This said, Shee to his neck and eares new length imparts; T'his Browe th'antlers of long-liuing Harts: His leggs and feet with armes and hands supply'd; And cloth'd his body in a spotted hide. To this, feare added. Actæon the son of Autonoe Autonoëius flyes, And wonders at the swiftnesse of his thighes. But, when his looks he in the Riuer view'd, He would haue cry'd, Woe's me! no words insew'd: His words were grones. He frets, with galling teares, Cheeks not his owne; yet his owne mind he beares. What should he doe? Goe home? or in the Wood For euer lurke? Feare, this; shame at that withstood. While thus he doubts, his Doggs their Master view: The transposition of these names in divers places to sure with the numbers haue caused some to taxe there interpretations. Black-foot and Tracer, opening first, persew: Sure Tracer, Gnossus; Black-foot Sparta bare. Then all fell in, more swift then forced Ayre: Spie, Rauener, Clime-cliffe; these Arcadia bred: Strong Fawn-bane, Whirlewinde, eager Follow-dread; Hunter; for sent; for speede, Flight went before; Fierce Salvage, lately ganched by a Bore; Greedy, with her two whelps; grim Wolf-got Ranger; Stout Shepherd, late preserving flocks from danger; Gaunt Catch, whose race from Sicyonia came; Patch, Courser, Blab, rash Tyger nevertame; Blanch, Mourner, Royster, Wolfe surpassing strong; And Tempest, able to continue long: Swift, with his brother Churle, a Cyprian hound; Bold Snatch; whose sable brows a white star cround; Cole, shag-hair'd Rug, and Light-foot wondrous fleet, Bred of a Spartan Bitch, his Sire of Creet: White-tooth, and Ring-wood (others not to expresse.) O're Rocks, o're Crags, o're Cliffs that want accesse, Through streightned wayes, and where there was no way, The well-mouth'd hounds pursue the princely prey. Where oft he wont to follow, now he flyes; Flyes from his family! in thought he cryes, I am Actæon, servants, knowe your Lord! Thoughts wanted words. High skyes the noyse record. First, Collier pincht him by the haunch: in flung Fierce Kill-deare; Hill-bred on his shoulder hung. These came forth last; but crost a nearer way A-thwart the hills. While thus their Lord they stay, In rush the rest; who gripe him with their phangs. Now is no roome for wounds. Grones speake his pangs, Though not with humane voyce, vnlike a Hart: In whose laments the knowne Rocks beare a part. Pitcht on his knees, like one who pitty craues, His silent looks, instead of Armes, he waues. With vsuall showts their Dogs the Hunters cheare; And seeke, and call Actæon. He (too neare!) Made answer by mute motions, blam'd of all For being absent at his present fall. Present he was, that absent would haue beene; Nor would his cruell hounds haue felt, but seene. Their snowts they in his body bathe; and teare Their Master in the figure of a Deare: Nor, till a thousand wounds had life disseis'd, Could quiver-bearing Dian be appeas'd. 'Twas censur'd variously: for, many thought The punishment farre greater then the fau't. Others so sowre a chastitie commend, As worthy her: and both, their parts defend. Iuno. Ioue's wife not so much blam'd or prays'd the deed; As shee rejoyceth at the wounds that bleed In Cadmus Family; who keeps in mind Europa's rape, and hateth all the kind. SemeleNow new occasions fresh displeasure moue: For Semele was great with child by Ioue. Then, thus shee scolds: O, what amends succeeds Our lost complaints! I now will fall to deeds. If we be more then titularly great; If we a Scepter sway; if heaven our seat; If Ioue's fear'd Wife and Sister (certainly, His Sister) torment shall the Whore destroy. Yet, with that theft perhaps she was content, And quickly might the iniurie repent: But, shee conceiues, to aggravate the blame, And by her Belly doth her crime proclaime. Who would by Iupiter a Mother proue, Which, Spoken perhaps in regard of the paucity of her children: for Juno bare Vulcan Mars, Lucina, and Hebe, vnto Iupiter. hardly once, hath hapned to our loue: So confident is beautie! Yet shall she Faile in that hope: nor let me Iuno be, Vnlesse, by her owne Ioue destroy'd, shee make A swift descent vnto the The aboads of the dead. Stygian Lake. Shee quits her throne, and in a yellow clowd Approach't the Palace; nor dismist that shrowd, Till shee had wrinkled her smooth skin, and made Her head all gray: while creeping feete conuay'd Her crooked lims; her voice small, weake, and hoarce, Like Beroe of Epidaure, her Nurse. Long talking; at the mention of Ioues name, She sigh't, and said; Pray heauen, he proue the same! Yet much I feare: For it was held for no dishonour, but a high reputation, to be imbraced by a God: vnder which pretext a Roman lady was abused in the raigne of Tiberius. for many oft beguile With that pretext, and chastest beds defile. Though Ioue; that's not enough. Giue he a signe Of his affection, if he be diuine. Such, and so mighty, as when pleasure warmes His melting bosome, in high Iuno's armes; With thee, such and so mighty, let him lie, Deckt with Lightning and Thunder. the ensignes of his deitie. Thus shee adviz'd the vnsuspecting Dame; Who beggs of Ioue a boone without a name. To whom the God: Choose, and thy choyce possesse; Yet, that thy diffidencie may be lesse, Witnesse Styx. that Powre, who through obscure aboads Spreads his dull streames: the feare, and God of Gods. Pleas'd with her harme, of too much powre to moue! That now must perish by obsequious loue: Such be to me, she said, as when the Invites Of Iuno summon you to Venus Rites. Her mouth he sought to stop: but, now that breath Was mixt with ayre which sentenced her death. Then fetch't a sigh, as if his brest would teare (For, she might not vnwish, nor he vnsweare) And sadly mounts the skie; who with him tooke The Clouds, that imitate his mournefull looke; Thick showrs and tempests adding to the same, Low'd thunder and inevitable flame. Whose rigor yet he striueth to subdew: Not armed with that fire which ouerthrew Typheus.The hundred-handed Giant; 'twas too wilde: There is another lightning, far more milde, By Vulcans Smiths: See the comment.

This shee denies; Tiresias must decide The difference, who both delights had try'd. For, two ingendring Serpents once he found, And with a stroke their slimy twists vnbound; Who straight a Woman of a Man became: Seuen Autums past, he in the eighth the same Refinding, said: If such your power so strange, That they who strike you must their nature change; Once more I'le trie. Then, struck, away they ran: And of a Woman he became a Man. He, chosen Vmpire of this sportfull strife, Ioue's words confirm'd. This vext his froward wife, More then the matter crau'd.

First In that a Sea-Nymph, the daughter of Oceanus and Tethys. blew Liriope sad triall made How that was but too true which he had saide: Whom in times past Cephisus flood imbrac't Within his winding streams: and forc't the chaste. The louely Nymph (who not vnfruitfull prou'd) Brought forth a boy, euen then to be belou'd, Narcissus nam'd. Enquiring if old age Should crowne his Youth; He, in obscure presage, Made this reply: Except himselfe he knowe. Long, they no credit on his words bestowe: Yet did the euent the prophecie approue, In his strange ruine and new kinde of loue. Now, he to fifteene added had a yeare: Now in his looks both boy and man appeare. Many a loue-sick Youth did him desire; And many a Maid his beauty set on fire: Yet, in his tender age his pride was such, That neither youth nor Mayden might him touch. Eccho.The vocall Nymph, this louely Boy did spy (She could not proffer speech, nor not reply) When busie in persuit of saluage spoyles, He draue the Deere into his corded toyles. Eccho was then a body, not a Voyce: Yet then, as now, of words she wanted choyce; But only could reiterate the close Of euery speech. This Iuno did impose. For, often when she might haue taken Ioue, Compressing there the Nymphs, who weakely stroue; Her long discourses made the Goddesse stay, Vntill the Nymphs had time to run-away. Which when perceiu'd; shee said, For this abuse Thy tongue henceforth shall bee of little vse. Those threats are deeds: She yet ingeminates The last of sounds, and what she hears relates. Narcissus seene, intending thus the chace; She forth-with glowes, and with a noyselesse pace His steps persues; the more she did persew, More hot (as neerer to her fire) she grew: And might be likened to a sulph'rous match; Which instantly th'approached flame doth catch. How oft would shee haue woo'd him with sweete words. But, Nature no such liberty affords: Begin she could not, yet full readily To his expected speech she would reply. The Boy, from his companions parted, said; Is any nigh? I, Eccho answere made. He, round about him gazed (much appall'd) And cry'd out, Come. She him, who called, call'd. Then looking back; and seeing none appear'd, Why shunst thou mee? The selfe-same voyce he heard, Deceiued by the Image of his words; Then let vs ioyne, said he: no sound accords More to her wish: her faculties combine In deare consent; who answer'd, Let vs ioyne! Flattering her selfe, out of the woods she sprung; And would about his struggling neck haue hung. Thrust back; he said, Life shall this breast forsake, Ere thou, light Nymph, on me thy pleasure take. On me thy pleasure take, the Nymph replyes To that disdainefull Boy, who from her flyes. Despis'd; the wood her sad retreat receaues: Who couers her ashamed face with leaues; And sculks in desert caues. Loue still possest Her soule; through griefe of her repulse, increast. Her wretched body pines with sleeplesse care: Her skinne contracts: her blood converts to ayre. Nothing was left her now but voyce and bones: The voyce remaynes; the other turne to stones. Conceal'd in Woods, in Mountaines neuer found, Yet heard in all: and all is but So Eccho signifies. a Sound. Thus her, thus other Nymphs, in mountaynes born, And sedgy brooks, the Boy had kild with scorn. Thus many a Youth he had afore deceiu'd: When one thus praid, with hands to heau'n vpheau'd; So may he loue himselfe, and so despaire! Nemesis; of the Citty Rhamnus in Attica, where she had her temple. The Goddesse of indignation. See the comment. Rhamnusia condescends to his iust pray'r. A Spring there was, whose siluer Waters were, As smooth as any mirror, nor lesse cleare: Which neither Heards-men, tame, nor saluage Beast, Nor wandring Fowle, nor scattered leaues molest; Girt round with grasse, by neighbouring moysture fed, And Woods, against the Sunnes invasion spred. He, tyr'd with heat and hunting, with the Place And Spring delighted, lyes vpon his face. Quenching his thirst, another thirst doth rise; Rays'd by the forme which in that glasse he spyes. The hope of nothing doth his powres invade: And for a body he mistakes a shade. Himselfe, himselfe distracts: who pores thereon So fixedly, as if of Paros is an Iland of the Ægean Sea; famous for her white marble. Parian stone. Beholds his eyes, two starres! his dangling haire Which with vnshorn Apollo's might compare! His fingers worthy Bacchus! his smooth chin! His Iuory neck! his heauenly face! where-in The Aglaia, Thalia, and Euphrosine. See the comment on the sixth booke. linked Deities their Graces six! Where Roses with vnsullied Lillies mix! Admireth all; for which, to be admir'd: And vnconsiderately himselfe desir'd. The prayses, which he giues, his beautie claym'd. Who seeks, is sought: th'Inflamer is inflam'd. How often would he kisse the flattering spring! How oft with downe-thrust arms sought he to cling About that loued neck! Those cous'ning lips Delude his hopes; and from himselfe he slips. Not knowing what, with what he sees he fryes: And th'error that deceiues, incites his eyes. O Foole! that striu'st to catch a flying shade! Thou seek'st what's no-where: Turn aside, 'twill fade. Thy formes reflection doth thy sight delude: Which is with nothing of its owne indu'd. With thee it comes; with thee it staies; and so 'Twould goe away, hadst thou the powre to goe. Nor sleep, nor hunger could the lover rayse: Who, lay'd along, on that false forme doth gaze With lookes, which looking never could suffice; And ruinates himselfe with his owne eyes. At length, a little lifting vp his head; You Woods, that round about your branches spred, Was ever so vnfortunate a Lover! You know, to many you haue beene a cover; From your first growth to this long distant day Haue you knowne any, thus to pine away! I like, and see: but yet I cannot find The lik't, and seene. O Loue, with error blind! What grieues me more; no Sea, no Mountayne steep, No wayes, no walls, our ioyes a-sunder keep: Whom but a little water doth divide; And he himselfe desires to be inioy'd. As oft as I to kisse the flood decline, So oft his lips ascend, to close with mine. You'ld thinke we toucht: so small a thing doth part Our equall loues! Come forth, what ere thou art. Sweet Boy, a simple Boy beguile not so: From him that seeks thee, whither would'st thou go? My age nor beauty merit thy disdaine: And me the Nymphs haue often lou'd in vaine. Yet in thy friendly shewes my poore hopes liue; Still striving to receiue the hand I giue: Thou smil'st my smiles: when I a teare let fall, Thou shedd'st an other; and consent'st in all. And, lo, thy sweetly-moving lips appeare. To vtter words, that come not to our eare. Ah, He is I! now, now I plainly see: Nor is't my shaddow that bewitcheth me. Loue of my selfe me burnes; (ô too too sure!) I suffer in those flames which I procure. Shall I be woo'd, or wooe? What shall I craue? Since what I covet, I already haue. Too much hath made me poore! O, you divine And favoring Powres, me from myselfe dis-ioyne! Of what I loue, I would be dispossest: This, in a Lover, is a strange request! Now, strength through griefe decayes: short is the time I haue to liue; extinguisht in my prime. Nor grieues it me to part with well-mist breath; For griefe will find a perfect cure in death: Would he I loue might longer life inioy! Now, two ill-fated Lovers, in one, die. This said; againe vpon his Image gaz'd; Teares on the troubled water circles rais'd: The motion much obscur'd the fleeting shade. With that, he cry'd (perceiuing it to vade) O, whither wilt thou! stay: nor cruell proue, In leauing me, who infinitely loue. Yet let me see, what cannot be possest, And, with that emptie food, my fury feast. Complaining thus, himselfe he disarrayes; And to remoreselesse hands his brest displayes: The blowes that solid snowe with crimson stripe; Like Apples party-red, or Grapes scarce ripe. But, in the water when the same appeare, He could no longer such a sorrow beare. As Virgin wax dissolues with fervent heat; Or morning frost, whereon the Sunne-beames beat: So thawes he with the ardor of desire; And, by degrees consumes in vnseene fire. His meagre cheeks now lost their red and white; That life; that favour lost, which did delight. Nor those divine proportions now remaine, So much by Eccho lately lou'd in vaine. Which when she saw; although she angry were, And still in minde her late repulse did beare; As often as the miserable cry'd, Alas! Alas, the wofull Nymph reply'd. And euer when he struck his sounding brest, Like sounds of mutuall sufferance exprest. His last words were, still hanging o're his shade; Ah, Boy, belou'd in vaine! so Eccho said. Farewell. Farewell, sigh't she. Then downe he lyes: Deaths cold hand shuts his selfe-admiring eyes: Which now eternally their gazes fix Vpon the Waters of infernall A River of Hell. Styx.

But, proud Pentheus: the sonne of Echion by Agaue the daughter of Cadmus. Echion's sonne, who did despise The righteous Gods, derides his prophecies; And twits Tiresias with his ravisht sight. He shook his head, which age had cloth'd in white; And said, 'Twere well for thee, hadst thou no eyes To see the The Orges of Bacchus. Bacchanal solemnities. The time shall come (which I presage is neere) When Bacchus, the sonne of Semele called Liber, in that wine dischargeth the heart from sorrow. Semeleian Liber will be here: Whom if thou honour not with Temples due; Thy Mother, and her sisters shall imbrue Their furious hands in thy effused bloud; And throw thy seuerr'd lims about the Wood. 'Twill be; thy malice cannot but rebell: And then thou'lt say; The blinde did see too well. His mouth proud Pentheus stops.

In that that the Dragon was consecrated to Mars, fr? whose teeth they sprung: or rather for that a warlike people.You sonnes of Mars, you of the Dragons race (Said Pentheus. he) what fury doth your minds imbase? See the Comment.Is Brasse of such a powre, which drunkards beat, Or sound of Hornes or Magicall deceit; That you, whom Trumpets clangor, horrid fight, Nor death, with all his terrors, could affright; Lowd Women, wine-bred rage, a lustfull crew Of Beasts, and Kettle-drums, should thus subdew? At you, Those who came with Cadmus from Phœnicia, whereof Tyrus and Sidon are the principall Citties. graue Fathers, can I but admire! Who brought with you your flying Gods from Tyre, And fixt them here: now from that care so farre Estranged, as to lose them without warre! Or you, who of my able age appeare; Whose heads should helmets, and not garlands, weare! Not leavy Iauelins, but good Swords adorne The hands of Youth. O you, so nobly borne; That Dragon's fiery fortitude indue, Whose single valour such a number slue. He, in defending of his Fountaine fell: Doe you th' Invaders of your fame repell. He slue the strong: doe you the weake destroy; And free your Country from foule infamy. If Destinies decree that Thebes must fall; May men, may warlike engins raze her wall: Let sword and fire our famisht liues assault: Then should we not be wretched through our fault, Nor striue to hide our guilt; but, Fortune blame; And vent our pittied sorrowes without shame. Now, by a naked Boy we are put to flight: Whom bounding Steeds, nor glorious Armes delight; But haire perfum'd with Myrrhe, soft Garlands, or Chaplets of flowres.

So haue I seene an vnstopt torrent glide With quiet waters, scarcely heard to chide: But, when falne Trees, or Rocks, impeacht his course; To fome, and roare with vncontroled force. All bloody they returne. Where is, said he, This Bacchus? Bacchus none of vs did see, Reply'd they; This his minister we found (Presenting one with hands behinde him bound) A Thuscan zealous in those mysteries. On whom fierce Pentheus lookes, with wrathfull eyes: Who hardly could his punishment deferre. Then, thus: Thou wretch, that others shalt deterre, Declare thy name, thy Nation, Parentage; And why thou followest this new-fangled Rage, The Tyrrhen Pirats.He, in whom innocency feare ore-came; Made this reply: Acetes is my name: My life I owe to the Lydia, called formerly Mæonia yet Acetes a little before is said to bee a Thuscan or a Tyrrhenian, for the Lydians, oppressed with famine led by Tyrrhenus the sonne of Atys planted a Colonie in Thuscany: so Acetes was by birth a Lydian, and a Tuscan by habitation.

When aged Night Aurora's blushes fled, I rose; and bade my men fresh water bring: Shewing the way that guided to the Spring. Then, from a Hill obseru'd the windes accord; My Mates I cald, and forth-with went abord. All here, the Master's Mate Opheltes cryes: And thinking he had light vpon a prize, Along the shore a louely Boy convay'd, Adorned with the beauty of a Maid. Heavy with wine and sleep, hee reeled so, That, though supported, he could hardly goe. When I beheld his habit, gait, and feature, I could not thinke it was a humane Creature. Fellowes, I doubt what God, but sure said I, This excellence includes a Deitie. O, be propitious, who-so-'ere thou art; Vnto our industry successe impart; And pardon these who haue offended thus. Then, Dictys said: Forbeare to pray for vs: (Than he, none could the top saile-yard bestride With lighter speed; nor thence more nimbly slide) This, Libys, swart Melanthus (who the Prow Commanded) and Alcimedon allow; Epopeus the Boats-swaine, so all say; Bewitched with the blind desire of prey.

Whereat, the desperate Lycabas grew wild; Who for a bloudy murder was exil'd From Tuscany. Whil'st I alone resist, He tooke me such a buffet with his fist, That downe I fell; and had falne over-board, If I (though senselesse) had not caught a cord. The wicked Company the fact approue. Then, Bacchus (for, 'twas he) began to moue, As if awaked with the noyse they made (His wine-bound senses now discharg'd) and said. What clamor's this? What doe you? Sailers, whether Meane you to beare me? Ah, how came I hither! Feare not, said Proreus: name where thou would'st be; And to that Harbor we will carry thee. Then, Friends, Bacchus.

What is my fault? what glory in my spoyle, If men a Boy, if many one beguile? I wept afore: but, they my teares deride; And with laborious Oares the waues divide.

Tree whose berryes chang'd their hew; The white to black, by bloods aspersion, growne: This pleaseth best, as being most vnknowne. Pyramvs And Thisbe.Who thus began; and drawes the following woll. Young Pyramus (no Youth so beautifull Through all the East) and Thisbe (who for faire Might with th'immortall Goddesses compare) Ioyn'd houses, Babylon: whose arched walls were numbred amongst the Worlds 7 Wonders; 360 furlongs, that is, 45 miles in circuit. where Semiramis inclos'd Her stately towne, with walls of brick compos'd. This neighbourhood their first acquaintance bred; That, grew to loue; Loue sought a nuptiall bed; By Parents crost: yet equall flames their blood A like incenst, which could not be withstood. Signes only vtter their vnwitnest loues: But hidden fire the violenter proues. A cranny in the parting wall was left; By shrinking of the new-layd morter, cleft: This for so many ages vndescry'd (What cannot loue find out!) the Louers spy'd. By which, their whispering voices softly trade, And Passion's amorous embassie convay'd. On this side and on that, like Snailes they cleaue; And greedily each others breath receaue, O envious walls (said they) who thus diuide Whom Loue hath ioyn'd! O, giue vs way to slide Into each others armes! if such a blisse Transcend our Fates, yet suffer vs to kisse! Nor are w'ingrate: much we confesse we owe To you, who this deare liberty bestowe. At night they bid farewell. Their kisses greet The senselesse stones, with lips that could not meet. When from th'approching Morn the stars withdrew, And that the Sunne had drunke the scorched dew, They at the vsuall Station meet againe; And with soft murmers mutually complaine. At last, resolue in silence of the Night To steale away, and free themselues by flight; And with their houses, to forsake the Towne. Yet, lest they so might wander vp and downe; To meete at The first King of Assyria, &amp; husband to Semiramis. Ninus tombe they both agree, Vnder the shelter of a shady Tree. There, a high Mulbery, full of white fruit, Hard by a liuing Fountaine fixt his Root. The Sun, that seem'd too slow, his steeds bestowes In restfull Seas: According to the old vulgar opinion, that where the Sun setts, the night appeareth to ascend. from Seas, wisht Night arose. Then Thisbe in the darke the doores vnbarr'd; And slipping forth, vnmissed by her guard, Comes maskt to Ninus tomb: there in the cold Sits vnderneath that Tree: Loue made her bold. When (lo!) a Lyonesse, smear'd with the blood Of late-slaine Beeues, approacht the neighbour flood, To quench her thirst. Far-off by Moon-light spy'd, Swift feare her flight into a Caue doth guide. Flying, her mantle from her shoulders fell: The fatall Lionesse, as from the Well Vp to the rocky Mountaine shee with-drawes, Found it, and tore it with her bloudy iawes. When Pyramus, who came not forth so soone, Perceiued by the glimpses of the Moone The footing of wild Beasts: his looke grew pale. But when he spy'd her torne and bloody vaile; One night (said he) too louers shall destroy! Shee longer life deserued to inioy. The guilt is mine: 'twas I (poore soule!) that slew thee Who to a place so full of danger drew thee, Nor came before. You Lyons, ô descend From your aboads! a wretch in peeces rend, Condemned by his selfe-pronounced doom: And make your entralls my opprobrious tomb! But Cowards wish to die. Her mantle hee Carryes along vnto th'appointed Tree. There hauing kist, and washt it with his eyes; Take from our blood, said he, the double dyes. With that, his body on his sword he threw: Which, from the reaking wound, he dying drew. Now, on his back, vp-spun the blood in smoke: As when a Spring-conducting pipe is broke, The waters at a little breach breake out, And hissing, through the aëry Region spout. The Mulberryes their former white forsake; And from his sprinkling blood their crimson take. Now she, who could not yet her feare remoue, Returns, for feare to disappoint her Loue. Her eager spirit seekes him through her eyes; Who longs to tell of her escap't surprise. The place and figure of the Tree she knew; Yet doubts, the berryes hauing chang'd their hew. Vncertayne; she his panting lims descry'd, That struck the stayned earth; and starts aside. Box was not paler then her changed looke: And like the lightly breath'd-on Sea she shooke. But, when she knew 'twas he (now dispossest Of her amaze) shee shreeks, beats her swolne brest, Puls off her haire; imbraces, softly reares His hanging head, and fills his wound with teares. Then, kissing his cold lips: Woe's me (she said) What cursed Fate hath this division made! O speake, my Pyramus! ô looke on me! Thy deare, thy desperate Thisbe calls to thee! At Thisbe's name he opens his dim eyes; And hauing seene her, shuts them vp, and dyes. But when his emptie scabbard shee had spy'd, And her known Robe; Vnhappy man! she cry'd, These wounds from loue, from thine own hand proceed! Nor is my hand too weake for such a deed: My loue as strong. This, this shall courage giue To force that life which much disdaynes to liue. In death I'le follow thee! instyl'd by all, The wretched Cause, and partner of thy Fall. Whom Death (that had (alas!) alone the might To pull thee from me!) shall not dis-vnite. O you, our wretched Parents (thus seuere To your owne blood!) my last Petition heare: Whom constant loue, whom death hath ioyn'd, interre Without your envy in one Sepulcher. And thou, ô Tree, whose branches shade the slaine; Of both our slaughters beare the lasting staine: In funerall habit euer clothe your brood; A liuing monument of our mixt blood. This said, his sword, yet reeking, shee reuers't, And with a mortall wound her bosome pearc't, The easie Gods vnto her wish accord; Their Parents also her desire afford: The late-white Mulberies in black now mourne; And what the fire had left, lay in one It was an ancient and long continued custome, to burne the bodies of the dead, to put their ashes into vessels (which they called Vrnes) either of stone or mettall, &amp; to inclose them in their Sepulchres. Vrne. Here ended she. Some intermission made, Leucothoe, her sisters silent, said: This Sunne, who all directeth with his light, Weake Loue hath tam'd: his loues we now recite, He first discouer'd the adulterie Of Mars and Venus (nothing scapes his eye.) Mars And Venvs. And in displeasure told to Vulcan, the celestiall Smith Iuno's sonne Their secret stealths, and where the deede was done. His spirits faint: his hands could not sustaine The worke in hand. Forthwith, he forg'd a chaine, With nets of brasse, that might the eye deceaue, (Lesse curious far the webs which Spiders weaue) Made pliant to each touch, and apt to close: This, he about the guilty bed bestowes.

Hyperion the father of the Titans begot on Titæa his wife and sister: among whom the Sun and the moone: so fained in that he first observed there motion and divulged that knowledge. Hyperion's sonne, what boots thy pearcing sight! Thy feature, colour, or thy radiant light! For thou, who earth inflamest with thy fires, Art now thy selfe inflam'd with new desires. Thy melting eyes alone Leucothoë view; And giue to her, what to the World is dew. Now, in the East thou hastnest thy vp-rise: Now, slowly sett'st; euen loath to leaue the skyes. And, while that obiect thus exacts thy stay, Thou addest houres vnto the Winters day. Oft, in thy face thy mindes disease appeares; Affrighting all the darkned World with feares.

Now, while cœlestiall food their hunger feeds, And Night in her alternate raigne succeeds: In figure of Eurynome, the God Approcht the chamber, where his life aboad. He, spinning by a lamp, Leucothoë found, With twice six hand-maids, who inclos'd her round. Then kissing her (her Mother now by Art) I haue, said he, a secret to impart: Maids, presently withdraw. They all obay'd. He, after he had cleer'd the chamber, said: The tardie Yeare I measure: I am he Who see all Obiects, and by whom all see; The World's cleere eye: by thy fair selfe, I sweare, I loue thee aboue thought. She shooke for feare; Her spindle and her distaffe from her fell: And yet that feare became her woundrous well, Then, his owne forme and radiancy, he tooke: Though with that vnexpected presence strooke; Yet, vanquisht by his beauty, her complaint Shee laid-aside, and suffered his constraint. This Clytie vext (not lesse affectionate Before to her) who with a rivalls hate Divulg'd the quickly-spreading infamy: And to her father doth the fact descry.

Neuer did Phœbus with such sorrow morne Since wretched Phaeton the World did burne: Yet striues he with his influence to beget In her cold lims a life-revoking heat. But, since the Fates such great attempts withstood; He steeps the place and body in a floud Of fragrant Nectar: much bewailes her end: And sighing, said; The smoake of Frankincense was supposed to delight the Gods in their cœlestiall dwellings. Yet shalt thou heauen ascend. Forthwith, her body thawes into a dew: Which, from the moystned earth, an odour threw. Then through the hill a shrub of Frankincense Thrust vp his crowne, and tooke his root from thence. Though loue might Clyteis sorrow haue excus'd; Clytie. Sorrow, her tongue; Daye's King her bed refus'd. She, with distracted passion, pines away, Detesteth company; all night, all day, Disrobed, with her ruffled haire vnbound, And wet with humour, sits vpon the ground: For nine long daies all sustenance forbeares; Her hugner cloyd with dew, her thirst with teares: Nor rose; but, riuers on the God her eyes; And ever turnes her face to him that flyes. At length, to earth her stupid body cleaues: Her wan complexion turnes to blood-lesse leaues, Yet streak't with red: her perisht lims beget The Heliotrope or Turn-selA flowre, resembling the pale-Violet; Which, with the sun, though rooted fast, doth moue; And, being changed, changeth not her loue. Thus she. This wondrous story caught their eares: To some the same impossible appeares; Others, that all is possible, conclude, To true-styl'd Gods: but, Bacchus they extrude.

When Summers fiue he thrice had multiply'd; Leauing the fount-full Hills of foster Ide, He wandred through strange Lands, pleas'd with the sight Of forrain streames; toyle less'ning with delight. The Lycian Cities past, he treads the grounds Of wealthy Caria, which on Lycia bounds: There lighted on a Poole, so passing cleere, That all the glittering bottome did appeare; Inviron'd with no marish-louing Reeds, Nor piked Bull-rushes, nor barren weeds: But, liuing Turf vpon the border grew; Whose euer-Spring no blasting Winter knew. A Nymph this haunts, vnpractiz'd in the chace, To bend a Bow, or run a strife-full race. Of all the Water-Nymphs, this Nymph alone To nimble-footed Diana, the virgin huntresse Dian was vnknowne. Her sisters oft would say; Fie, Salmacis, Fie lazie sister, what a sloth is this! Vpon a Quiuer, or a Iauelin seaze; And with laborious hunting mix thine ease. On Quiuer, nor on Iauelin, would she seaze; Nor with laborious hunting mix her ease. But now in her owne Fountaine bathes her faire And shapefull lims; now kembs her golden haire; Her selfe oft by that liquid mirror drest; There taking counsell what became her best: Her body in transparent Robes array'd, Now on soft leaues, or softer mosse display'd: Oft gathers flowres; so, when she saw the Boy: Whom seen, forthwith shee couets to inioy; And yet would not approach, though big with haste, Till neatly trickt, till all in order plac't; Her loue-inueighling lookes set to insnare; Who merited to be reputed faire. Sweet Boy, said she, well worthy the aboad Of blest cœlestialls! if thou be a God, Then art thou Cupid! if of humane race, Happy the Parents, whom thy person grace! Thy sister, if thou hast a sister, blest! Thy Nurse, much more, who fed thee with her brest! But (ô!) no lesse then deifi'd is shee Whom mariage shall incorporate to thee! If any such; let me this treasure steale: If not, be't I; and our deare Nuptials seale. This said, she held her peace. He blusht for shame; Not knowing loue: whom shamefac'tnesse became. So Apples shew vpon the sunny side; So Ivory, with rich Vermillion dy'd: So pure a red the siluer Moon doth staine, When When in her eclipse: at which time they supposed she was inchanted; and beat on the bottomes of basons and kettles to drowne the voice of the charmes whereof Iuvina, speaking of a talkatiue woman—Shee alone. Can rescue with her tongue the labouring Moone. auxil'ary brasse resounds in vaine. Shee earnestly intreats a sisters kisse: And now, aduancing to imbrace her blisse, He, strugling, said; Lasciuious Nymph, forbeare; Or I will quit the place, and leaue you here. Faire Stranger, timorous Salmacis reply'd, 'Tis freely yours; and therewith stept aside: Yet, looking back, amongst the shrubby Trees She closely sculks, and crouches on her knees. The vacant Boy, now being left alone, Imagining he was obseru'd by none, Now here, now there, about the margent trips; And, in th' alluring waues his ankles dips. Caught with the Water's flattering temp'rature, He streight disrobes his body; ô, how pure! His naked beauty Salmacis amaz'd: Who with vnsatisfied longing gaz'd. Her sparkling eyes shoot flames through this sweet error; Much like the Sunne reflected by a mirror. Now, she impatiently her hope delayes; Now, burnes t'imbrace: now, halfe-madde, hardly stayes. He swiftly from the banke on which he stood, Clapping his body, leaps into the flood; And, with his rowing armes, supports his lims: Which, through the pure waues, glister as he swims. Like Iuory statues, which the life surpasse; Or like a Lilly, in a crystall glasse. He's mine! the Nymph exclaim'd: who all vnstript; And, as she spake, into the water skipt: Hanging about the neck that did resist; And, with a mastring force, th' vnwilling kist: Now, puts her hand beneath his scornefull brest; Now every way invading the distrest: And wraps-about the subject of her lust, Much like a Serpent by an Eagle truss't; Which to his head and feet, infettered, clings; And wreaths her tayle about his stretcht-out wings. So clasping Ivy to the Oke doth grow; And so the A ravenous fish: so called of his many feet wherewith he catcheth his prey. Polypus detaines his foe. But Hermaphroditus; of Atlas the father of Maia, the mother of his father Mercury. Atlantiades, relentlesse coy, Still struggles, and resists her hop't-for ioy. Invested with her body: foole, said shee, Struggle thou mai'st, but neuer shalt be free. O you, who in immortall thrones reside, Grant that no day may ever vs divide! Her wishes had their Gods. Even in that space Their cleauing bodies mix: both haue one face. As when wee two divided scions ioyne, And see them grow together in one rine: So they, by such a strict imbracement glew'd, Are now but one, with double forme indew'd. No longer he a Boy, nor she a maid; But neither, and yet either, might be said. Hermaphroditus at himselfe admires: Who halfe a female from the spring retires, His manly lims now softned; and thus prayes, With such a voice as neither sex betrayes: Swift Mercury and Venus. Hermes, Mercury and Venus. Aphrodite! him ô heare Who was your sonne! who both your names doth beare! May every man, that in this water swims, Returne halfe-woman, with infeebled lims. His gentle parents signe to his request; And with vnknowne receits the spring infest. Mineides.Here, they conclude: yet giue their hands no rest; But Bacchus slight, and still prophane his Feast. Then, suddenly harsh instruments surprize Their charged eares, not extant to their eyes: Sweet Myrrhe and Saffron all the house perfume. Their webs (past credit!) flourish in the loome: The hanging wooll to green-leau'd Iuy spreads; Part, into vines: the equall twisted threads To branches run: buds from the distaffe shoot; And with that purple paint their blushing fruit. Now to the day succeeds that doubtfull light; Which neither can be called day, nor night. The building trembles: torches of fat Pines Appeare to burne; the roome with flashes shines; Fill'd with fantasticall resemblances Of howling Tigers, Lynxes, and Panthers, sacred to Bacchus. beasts, whom blood and slaughter please. The Mineides.The Sisters, to the smoaky roofe retire; And, there disperst, avoid both light and fire. Thus, while they corners seeke, thin films extend From lightned lims, with small beames inter-pend. But how their former shapes they did forgoe, Concealing darknesse would not let them knowe. Nor are these little Light-detesting things Born-vp with feathers, but transparent wings. Their voice befits their bodies; small, and faint: Wherewith they harshly vtter their complaint. These houses haunt, in night conceale their shame; Vespertiliones; of Vesper the evening, wherein they onely appeare Bats.And of the loued Euening take their name. All Thebes now feared Bacchus celebrates: Whose wondrous powre his boasting Ino, the sister of Semele. Aunt relates. She onely, of so many sisters, knew No griefe as yet, but what from them she drew.

Nor are they pestered for want of roome: Nor can it be perceiu'd that any come. Here shadowes wander from their bodies pent: Some plead; and some the Tyrants Court frequent: Some in life-practiz'd Arts imploy theretimes: Others are tortur'd for their former Crimes. Iuno the daughter of Saturne. Saturnia stooping from her Throne of Ayre (Her hate immortall!) thither makes repayre. As soone as she had entered the gate, The threshold trembl'd with her sacred waight. Still-waking The Hell hound. Cerberus the Goddesse dreads, And barketh thrice at once, with his three heads. She calls the Megæra, Alecto, and Tisiphone Daughters to old night; Implacable, and hating all delight. Before the doores of Adamant they sit; And there with combs their snaky curles vnknit. When they through gloomy darknesse did disclose That forme of Heauen, the Goddesses arose. The Dungeon of the Damned this is nam'd. Of these, and the causes of their torments, See the comment.Here Tityus, for attempted Rape defam'd, Had his vast body on nine Acres spread: And on his heart a greedy Vulture fed.

Importunately she soliciteth, Commands, intreats, and promist, with one breath.

Ivno And Melicertes.Well-pleas'd Saturnia then to heauen with-drew: Whom first The Rainebow, the daughter of Thaumas. Thaumantian Iris purg'd deaw. Forthwith, Tisiphone her garment takes, Dropping with blood, and girt with knotted Snakes. About her head a bloody torch she shooke; And swiftly those accurst aboads forsooke. Still-sighing Sorrow, Horror, trembling Feare, And gastly Madnesse, her associats were. The entred Palace gron'd: pale poyson soyles The polisht doores: the frighted Sunne recoyles. Then Athamas and Ino, strucke with dread And monstrous apparitions, sought t'haue fled: But sterne Tisiphone: for what the latines named a Fury, the Græcians called Erianys or the minds of dissention. Erinnys their escape withstands; And stretching out her viper-grasping hands, Shooke her darke browes. The troubled Serpents hist: Some, falling on her shoulders, there vntwist; Others, vpon her vgly brest descend, Spet poyson, and their forked tongues extend. Two Adders from her crawling haire she drew; And those at Athamas and Ino threw: These vp and down about their bosoms roule; And with infus'd infection sad the Soule. No wound vpon their bodies could be found: It was the mind that felt the desperate wound. She brought besides; from her abhorred home.

While sad Athamas And Ino quake, she powres into their brests The ragefull poyson; which their peace infests: Her flamy torch then whisking in a round (Whose circularie fire her conquest crown'd) To Pluto's emptie regiment she makes A swift descent; and there vngirts her Snakes. Forthwith, Athamas, the sonne of Æolus. Æolides with poyson boyles. An acclamation of Ioy. Iö, my Mates, he cryes, here pitch your toyles; Here, late a Lyonesse by me was seene With her two whelpes. With that pursues the Queene And from her brest Clearchus snatcht: The child Stretcht forth his little armes, and on him smil'd: Whom like a sling about his head he swings; And cruelly against the pauement flings. The Mother, whether with her griefe distraught. Or that the poyson on her senses wrought, Runs howling with her haire about her eares; And in bare armes her Melicerta beares; Cryes An out-cry vsed in the solemnities of Bacchus. Euohe Bacchus! Iuno laught, and said; Thus art thou by Bacchus, fostered at first by his Aunt Ino. thy Foster-child repay'd. There is a Rock that over-looks the Mayne, Hollow'd by fretting Surges, sconst from rayne; Whose craggy brow to vaster Seas extends. This, Ino (fury adding strength) ascends; Descending head-long, with the load she beares; And strikes the sparkling waues, that fall in teares Then, Venus, grieuing at Jno, her grandchild by Hermione. her Neece's Fate, Her Vnkle thus intreats: O thou, Neptune. whose State Is next to Ioue's; great Ruler of the Flood; My sute is bold; yet pitty thou my blood, Not tossed in the deepe Iönian Seas: And joyne them to thy watrie Deities.

Subdew'd with woes, with tragicall events, That had no end, and many dire ostents, He leaues his Citie; as not through his owne, But by the fortune of the place o're-throwne: And with his wife Hermione, long tost, At length arriueth at th' Illyrian Coast. Now spent with griefe and age, whil'st they relate Their former toyles, and Familie's first fate: And was that Whereof in the third Booke. Serpent sacred, which I slew (Said he) whose teeth into the Earth I threw (An vncouth seed) when I from Sidon came? If this, the vengefull Gods so much inflame, May I my belly Serpent-like extend! His belly lengthned, ere his wish could end. Tough scales vpon his hardned out-side grew; The black, distinguished with drops of blew. Then, falling on his breast, his thighs vnite; And in a spiny progresse stretch out-right. His armes (for, armes as yet they were) he spreads: And teares on cheekes, that yet were humane, sheds. Come, ô sad Soule, said he; thy husband touch; Whil'st I am I, or part of me be such. Shake hands, while yet I haue a hand to shake; Before I totally endue a Snake. His tongue was yet in motion; when it cleft In two, forthwith of humane speech bereft. He hist, when he his sorrowes sought to vent; The only language now which Nature lent. His Wife her naked bosome beats, and cryes, Stay Cadmus, and put-off these prodigies. O strange! where are thy feet, hands, shoulders, brest, Thy colour, face, and (while I speake) the rest! You Gods, why also am not I a Snake? He lickt her willing lips even as she spake; Into her well-knowne bosome glides; her waste, And yeelding neck, with louing twines imbrac't. Amazement all the standers-by possest; While glittering combs their slippery heads invest. Now are they two: who crept, together chayn'd, Till they the covert of the Wood attain'd. These gentle Dragons, knowing what they were, Doe hurt to no man, nor mans presence feare. Yet were those sorrowes by Bacchus the sonne of Semele their daughters sonne Much comforted, who vanquisht India won: To whom th' Achaians Temples consecrate; Divinely magnifi'd through either State. Alone Acrisius The sonne of Abas. Abantiades, Iupiter the father of Bacchus was the father of Belus grand father to Acrisius.Though of one Progenie, dissents from these: Who, from th' Argolian Citie, made him flie; And manag'd armes against a Deitie.

Now is the one inthroned in the skyes: The other through Ayr's empty Region flyes; And beares along the memorable Medusas Head. spoyle Persevs. Of that new Monster, conquer'd by his toyle. And as he o're the Lybian Deserts flew; The blood, that dropt from The Gorgons were three sisters of whom Medusa was only mortall.

Titan's panting steeds his Chariot steepe, And bathe their fierie feet-locks in the Deepe. A thousand Heards, as many Flocks, he fed In those large Pastures, where no neighbours tread. Here to their tree the shining branches sute; To them, their leaues; to those, the golden fruit. Great King, said Perseus, if high birth may moue Respect in thee, behold the sonne of Ioue: If admiration, then my Acts admire; Who rest, and hospitable Rites desire: He, mindfull of this prophecie, of old By sacred Themis of Parnassus told; In time thy golden fruit a prey shall proue, O Iaphet's sonne, vnto the sonne of Ioue. This fearing, he his Orchard had inclos'd With solid Cliffs, that all accesse oppos'd: The Guard whereof a monstrous Dragon held; And from his Land all Forrainers expell'd. Be gone, said he, for feare thy glories proue, But counterfeit; and thou no sonne to Ioue; Then addes vncivill violence to threats. With strength the other seconds his intreats: In strength inferior; Who so strong as he? Since curtesie, nor any worth in me, Vext Perseus said, can purchase my regard; Yet from a guest receiue thy due reward. With that, Medusa's vgly head he drew, His owne reversed. Forthwith, Atlas grew Into a Mountaine equall to the man: His haire and beard to woods and bushes ran; His armes and shoulders into ridges spred; And what was his, is now the Mountaines head: Bones turne to stones; and all his parts extrude Into a huge prodigious altitude.

Her Parents see their feares. Both mourne; both wretched (but, she iustly so:) Who bring no aid, but extasies of woe, With teares that sute the time: Who take the leaue They loathe to take; and to her body cleaue. You for your griefe may haue, Perseus. the stranger said, A time too long: short is the houre of aid. If freed by me, Ioue's sonne, in fruitfull gold Begot on Danaë through a brazen Hold; See the Comment.Who conquer'd Gorgon with the snakie haire; And boldly glide through vn-inclosed aire: If for your sonne you then will me prefer; Adde to this worth, That in deliuering her; I'le trie (so favour me the Powres divine) That shee, sau'd by my valour, may be mine. They take a Law; intreat what he doth offer: And further, for a Dowre their Kingdome proffer. Lo! as a Gally with fore-fixed prow (Row'd by the sweat of slaues) the Sea doth plow: Euen so the Monster furroweth with his brest, The foming flood; and to the neere Rocke prest: Not farther distant, then a man might fling A way-inforcing bullet from a sling. Forth-with, Perseus, begot by Jupiter in a golden showre. the youthfull issue of rich showres, Earth pushing from him, to the blew skye towres. The furious Monster eagerly doth chace His shadow, gliding on the Seas smooth face. And as The Eagle. Ioue's bird, when shee from high survaies A Dragon basking in Apollo's rayes; Descends vnseene, and through his necks blew scales (To shun his deadly teeth) her talons naile's: So swiftly stoops high-pitcht Perseus the Argiue: the Argiues so called of Inachus their first King; and of the River which carried his name. Inachides Through singing ayre: then on his back doth seaze; And neere his right fin sheaths his crooked sword Vp to the hilts; who deeply wounded, roar'd: Now capers in the ayre, now diues belowe The troubled waues; now turn's vpon his foe: Much like a chafed Bore, whom eager hounds Haue at a Bay, and terrifie with sounds. He, with swift wings, his greedy jawes avoids; Now, with his fauchion wounds his scaly sides; Now, his shell-rough-cast back; now, where the taile Ends in a Fish, or parts expos'd t'assaile. A streame mixt with his bloud the Monster flings From his wide throat; which wets his heavy wings: Nor longer dares the wary Youth rely On their support. He sees a rocke hard by, Whose top aboue the quiet waters stood; But vnderneath the winde-incensed flood. There lights; and, holding by the rocks extent, His oft-thrust sword into his bowels sent. The shore rings with th' applause that fills the sky. Then, Cepheus and Cassiope, with ioy, Salute him for their sonne: whom now they call The Saviour of their House, and of them all. Vp came Andromeda, freed from her chaines; The cause, and recompence of all his paines. Meane-while, he washeth his victorious hands Corall.In cleansing waues. And lest the beachy Sands Should hurt the snakie head, the ground he strew With leaues and twigs that vnder water grew: Whereon, Medusa's vgly face he layes. The greene, yet juicy, and attractiue sprayes From the toucht Monster stiffning hardnes tooke, And their owne natiue pliancy forsooke. The Sea-Nymphs this admired wonder trie On other sprigs, and in the issue ioy: Who sowe againe their Seeds vpon the Deepe. The Corall now that propertie doth keepé, Receiuing hardnesse from felt ayre alone: Beneath the Sea a twig, aboue a stone. Forth-with, three Altars he of Turf erects, To Mercury. Hermes, Ioue, and Pallas Minerva. Her who warre affects: Minerua's on the right; on the left hand Stood Mercurie's: Ioue's in the midst did stand. To Mercurie, a Calfe they sacrifice; To Ioue, a Bull; a Cow, to Pallas dyes: Then takes Andromeda, the full reward Of so great worth; with Dow'r, of lesse regard. Now, Loue and The President of Marriage Hymen vrge the Nuptiall Bed: The sacred Fires with rich perfumes are fed; The house hung round with Garlands; every-where Melodious Harps and Songs salute the eare; Of jocond mirth the free and happy signes: With Dores display'd, the golden Palace shines. The Those of Cepheus court. Cephen Nobles, and each stranger Guest, Together enter to this sumptuous Feast. The Banquet done, with generous wines they cheare Their hightned spirits: Perseus longs to heare Their fashions, manners, and originall; Who, by Lyncides is inform'd of all. This told; he said: Now tell, ô valiant Knight, Medvsa.By what felicity of force or sleight, You got this purchase of the snaky haires. Then Perseus of his great grandfather Abas. Abantiades forthwith declares, How vnder frosty Atlas cliffy side There lay a Plaine, with Mountaines fortifi'd: In whose accesse the The daughters of Phorcus. Phorcides did lye; Two sisters; both of them had but one eye: How cunningly his hands thereon he lay'd, As they from one another it convay'd. Then through blind wastes, and rocky forrests came To Gorgon's house: the way vnto the same, Beset with formes of men and beasts, alone By seeing of Medusa turn'd to stone: Whose horrid shape securely he did eye, In his bright target's cleere refulgency. And how her head he from her shoulders tooke, Ere heavy sleepe her snakes and her forsooke. Then told of The winged horse. Pegasus, and of his Crysaor. brother, Sprung from the blood of their new-slaughtred mother: Adding the perils past in his long way; What seats, what soyles, his eyes belowe suruay; And to what starres his lofty pitch ascends: Yet long afore their expectation ends. One Lord among the rest would gladly knowe, Why Serpents only on her head did growe. Stranger, said he, since this that you require Deserues the knowledge, take what you desire: Her passing beauty was the onely scope Of mens affections, and their envied hope: Yet was not any part of her more rare (So say they who haue seene her) then her haire. Whom Neptune in Minerua's Fane comprest. Ioue's daughter, with the The name of Minervas shield. Ægis on her brest, Hid her chaste blushes: and due vengeance takes, In turning of the Gorgon's haire to Snakes. Who now, to make her enimies affray'd, Beares in her shield the Serpents which she made. The Fifth Booke. The Argvment. The Gorgon seene, Cepheni Statues growe. So Phineus, Prætus, Polydect, the foe To Perseus prayse. The fountaine Hippocrene By Horse-hoofe rays'd. The Muses into Nine. Rape-flying Birds: Pierides, to Pyes. The Gods, by Typhon chac't, themselues disguise, Sad Cyane into a Fountaine flowes. Th'ill-nurtur'd Boy a spotted Stellion growes. Lou'd Arethusa thawes into a Spring. Ascalaphus an Owle. Light feathers wing The sweet-tongu'd Syrens, who on Waters bourne. Sterne Lyncus Ceres to a Lynx doth turne. VVhil'st the Perseus, the son of Danae. Danaean Heroe this relates, Amidst th'assembly of the Cephes States; Exalted voyces through the Palace ring: Not like to theirs who at a mariage sing; Phinevs. But such as menace warre. The Nuptiall Feast, Thus turn'd to tumult, to the life exprest A peacefull Sea, whose brow no frowne deformes, Streight ruffled into billowes by rude stormes. First The Vnkle and betrothed husband to Andromeda. Phineus, the rash Author of this warre, Shaking a Launce, began the deadly iarre. Lo, I the man, that will vpon thy life Reuenge, said he, the rapture of my wife. Nor shall thy wings, Said in that disguise to haue begotten him. nor Ioue in forged gold Worke thy escape. About to throwe: O hold! Perplexed Cepheus cries: What wilt thou do? What furie, frantick brother, tempts thee to So foule a fact? Is this the recompence For such high merit? For her life's defence? Not Perseus, but th'incens't The daughters of Nocus &amp; Nymphs of the Sea, with wh? Casslope contended. Nereides, But Iupiter Hammon worshipped in the forme of a Ram. horned Hammon, and the wrath of Seas (That Orke that sought my bowels to devoure). Hath snatcht her from thee; rauisht in the houre Of her exposure. But thy crueltie Perhaps was well content that she should die, To ease thy losse with ours. May't not suffice, That she was bound in chaines before thine eye; That thou, her Vncle, and her Husband, brought Her perill no preuention, nor none sought; But that anothers aid thou must envy, And claime the Trophys of his victory? Which, if of such esteeme, thou shouldst haue strain'd T'haue forc't them from those Rocks, where lately chaind. Let him, who did, enioy them: nor exact What is his dew by merit and compact. Nor thinke, we Perseus before thee prefer; But him, before so abhorr'd a sepulcher. He, without answere, rowling to and fro His eyes on either, doubts at which to throwe: And pausing, his ill-aymed lance at length At Perseus hurles, with rage-redoubled strength. Fixt in the bed-stock; vp fierce Perseus starts, And his retorted Speare at Phineus darts: Who suddenly behinde an Altar stept; An Altar vengeance from the wicked kept: And yet in Rhœtus brow the weapon stuck. He fell: the steele out of his scull they pluck: Who spurnes the earth, and staines the board with blood. With that, the multitude, with fury wood, Their Lances fling: and some there be who crie, That Cepheus, and his sonne in law, should die. But Cepheus wisely quits the clamorous Hall: Who Faith and Iustice doth to record call, With all the hospitable Gods; that hee Was from this execrable vp-rore free. The warlike Pallas, present, with her shield Protects Perseus, the son, and Pallas the daughter of Iupiter. her Brother, and his courage steel'd. Young Indian Atys by ill hap was there; Whom A riuer of India; Limniace some adioyning lake (for so the name signifies) here taken for a Nymph and his daughter: Ganges-got Limniace did beare In her cleare Waues: his beautie excellent, Which care and costly ornaments augment: Who scarce had fully sixteene Summers told: Clad in a Tyrian mantle, fring'd with gold. About his neck he wore a carquenet: His haire with Riband bound, and odors wet. Although he cunningly a Dart could throwe: Yet with more cunning could he vse his bowe. Which now a-drawing with a tardy hand; Quick Perseus from the Altar snatcht a Brand, And dasht it on his face: out-start his eyes; And through his flesh the shiuered bones arise. When Syrian Lycabas his Atys view'd, Shaking his formelesse looks, with blood imbrew'd: To him in strictest bonds of friendship ty'd, And one who could not his affection hide: After he had his tragedie bewail'd; Who through the bitter wound his soule exhal'd: He tooke the Bowe, which erst the Youth did bend; And said; With me, thou Murderer contend; Nor longer glorie in a Boye's sad fate, Which staines thy actions with deserued hate. Yet speaking, from the string the arrow flew: Which tooke his plighted robe, as he with-drew Perseus; of Acrisius his grandfather. Acrisioniades vpon him prest; And sheath'd his The name of Mercuries fauchion which he had lent to Perseus. Harpy in his groning brest. Now dying, he for Atys looks, with eyes That swim in night; and on his bosome lyes: Then chearfully expires his parting breath: Reioycing to be ioyn'd to him in death. Phorbas the Of Syene, a Citty in the South parts of Ægypt. Syënit, Methion's son, With him the Lybian Amphimedon; Eager of combate, slipping in the blood That drencht the pauement, fell: his sword withstood Their re-ascent, which through the short-ribs smote Amphimedon, and cut the others throte. Yet Perseus would not venture to invade The Halbertere Eritheus with his blade; But in both hands a Goblet high imbost And massie, tooke; which at his head he tost: Who vomits clotted blood; and, tumbling downe, Knocks the hard pauement with his dying crowne. Then Polydæmon (sprung from The daughter of Derceta the Syrian Goddesse. Goddesse-borne Semiramis) Phlegyas, the vnshorne Flyce, Clytus, Scythian, Abaris, And braue Lycetus (old Sperchesius blisse) Fell by his hand: whose feet in triumph tread Vpon the slaughtered bodies of the dead. But Phineus, fearing to confront his Foe In close assault, far-off a dart doth throwe: Which led by error, did on Ida light; A Neuter, who in vaine forbare to fight. He, sternly frowning, thus to Phineus spake: Since you, me an vnwilling partie make, Receiue the enemy whom you haue made; That, by a wound, a wound may be repay'd. About to hurle the Dart, drawne from his side; With losse of blood he faints, and falling dy'd. Then, great Odytes fell by Clymens sword; Next to the King, the greatest Cephen Lord: Hypsæus slew Protenor; Lyncedes Hypsæus. Old Emathion fell with these; Who fear'd the Gods, and fauoured the right. He, whom old age exempted from the fight, Fights with his tongue; himselfe doth interpose, And deepely execrates their wicked blowes. Cromis, as he imbrac't the Altar; lopt His shaking head; which on the Altar dropt: Whose halfe-dead tongue yet curses; and expires His righteous soule amidst the sacred Fires. Then Broteas and Ammon, Phineus slew; Who from one womb at once their being drew: Invincible with A weapon with plummets of lead hung at the end of a staffe. hurle-bats, could they quell The dints of swords. Neere these Alphytus fell, The Priest of Ceres, with a Miter crown'd; Which to his temples a white fillet bound. And thou Lampetides, whose pleasant wit Detesting discord, in soft peace more fit To sing vnto thy tunefull Lire; now prest With Songs to celebrate the nuptiall Feast: When Pettalus, at him who stood far off With his defenselesse Harp; strikes with this scoff; Goe sing the rest vnto the Ghosts belowe: And pearc't his Temples with a deadly blowe. His dying fingers warble in his fall: And then, by chance, the Song was tragicall. This, vnreveng'd, Lycormas could not brooke; But from the door's right side a Leauer tooke, And him betweene the head and shoulders knocks: Downe falls he, like a sacrificed Oxe. Ciniphean Palates then sought to seaze Vpon the left: when fierce Corilus the son of Marmorus: or so called of that country, whereof Strabo maketh mention. Marmorides His hand nail'd to the doore-post with a Speare: Whose side sterne Abas pearc't as he stuck there. Nor could he fall; but, giuing vp the ghost, Hung by the hand against the smeared post. Melaneus then, of Perseus partie fell; And Dorilas, whose riches did excell: In Nasœmonia none then he more great For large possessions, and huge hoards of Wheat. The steele stuck in his groine, which death persew'd: Whom Halcyoneus of Bactria view'd (The Author of the wound as he did roule His turn'd-vp eyes, and sighed out his soule: For all thy land, said he, by this diuorce Receiue thy length; and left his bloodlesse corse. The Speare, reuengefull Perseus, of his grandfather Abas Abanti'des drew From his warme wound; and at the Thrower threw: Which doth his nostrills in the midst diuide; And, passing through, appear'd on either side. Whilst Fortune crownd him, Clytius he confounds And Danus, of one womb, with different wounds: Through Clytius thighes a ready dart he cast; An other 'twixt the iawes of Danus past. Mindesian Celadon and Aster slew, His father doubtfull, gotten on a Iew: Echion, late well seene in things to come, Now ouer-taken by an vnknowne doome: Thoactes, Phineus Squire, his fauchion try'd: And fell Agytes, that foule parricide. Yet more remain'd then were already spent For, all of them, to murder one, consent. The bold Conspirators on all sides fight; Impugning promise, merit, and his right. The vainely-pious Cepheus. Father sides with th'other; With him, Andromeda and Cassiopea the frighted Bride, and pensiue Mother; Who fill the court with out-cryes; by the sound Of clashing Armes, and dying screeches drown'd. The Goddesse of War, and sister vnto Mars. Bellona the polluted floore imbrew's With streams of blood, and horrid warre renewes. False Phineus, with a thousand, in a ring Begirt the Heroe: who their Lances fling As thick as Winters haile; that blind his sight, Sing in his eares, and round about him light. His guarded back he to a pillar sets; And with vndaunted force confronts their threats. Chaonian Molpeus prest to his left side: The right, Nabathean Ethemon ply'd. As when a Tiger, pincht with famine, heares Two bellowing Herds within one vale; forbeares, Nor knowes on which to rush, as being loth To leaue the other, and would fall on both: So Perseus, which to strike vncertaine proues; Who daunted Molpeus with a wound remoues; Contented with his flight, in that the rage Of fierce Ethemon did his force ingage: Who at his neck vncircumspectly stroke, And his keene sword against the pillar broke. The Blade from vnrelenting stone rebounds; And in his throte th'vnhappy owner wounds. Yet was not that enough to work his end; Who fearfully doth now his armes extend For pitty vnto Perseus, all in vaine; Who thrust him through with his Mercuries fauchion: called Cyllenian of Cyllenus a mountaine of Arcadia, where hee was borne. Cyllenian skeine. But, when he saw his valour ouersway'd By multitude: I must said he, seeke ayd (Since you your selues compell me) from my foe; Friends turne your backs: then Medusas; one of the Gorgons. Gorgons head doth showe. Some others seeke, said Thessalus, to fright With this thy Monster; and with all his might A deadly dart indeauour'd to haue throwne: But in that positure became a stone. Next, Amphix, full of spirit, forward prest; And thrust his sword at bold Lyncides brest: When in the passe, his fingers stupid growe; Nor had the power of mouing to or fro. But Nileus (he who with a forged stile Vaunted to be the sonne of Discharging his streames into the sea by 7 Channels. seuen-fold Nile, And bare seuen siluer Riuers in his shield, Distinctly wauing through a golden field) To Perseus said: Behold, from whence we sprung! To euer-silent shadowes beare a-long This comfort of thy death, that thou didst die By such a braue and high-borne enemie. His vtterance faultred in the latter clause: The yet vnfinisht sound stuck in his iawes; Who gaping stood as he would something say: And so had done, if words had found a way. These Eryx blames; 'Tis your faint soules that dead Your powers, said he, and not the Gorgon's head. Rush on with me, and prostrate with deepe wounds This Youth, who thus with Magick armes confounds. Then rushing on, the ground his foot-steps stay'd; Now mutely fixt: an armed Statue made. These suffer'd worthily. One, who did fight For Perseus, bold Aconteus, at the sight Of Gorgon's snakes abortiue marble grew. On whom Astyages in fury flew, As if aliue, with his two-handed blade; Which shrilly twang'd; but no incision made: Who, whil'st he wonders, the same nature tooke; And now his Statue hath a wondring looke. It were too tedious for me to report Their names, who perisht of the vulgar sort. Two hundred scap't the furie of the fight: Two hundred turne to stone at Gorgon's sight: Now Phineus his vniust commotion rewes: What should he doe? the senselesse shapes he viewes Of his knowne friends, which differing figures bore; And doth by name their seuerall ayd implore. And yet not trusting to his eyes alone, The next he toucht; and found it to be stone. Then turnes aside: and now, a Penitent, With suppliant hands, and armes obliquely bent; O Perseus, thine, said he, thine is the day! Remoue this Monster. Hence, ô hence convay Medusa's vgly looks, or what more strange, Which humane bodies into marble change! Not hate, nor thirst of rule begot this strife: I onely fought to re-obtaine my wife. Thine is the plea of Merit; mine, of Time: Yet, in contending I confesse my crime. For life (ô chiefe of men) I onely sue: Afford me that: the rest I yeeld to you. Thus he; not daring to reuert his eyes On him whom he intreates: who thus replyes. Faint-hearted Phineus, what I can afford, (A gift of worth to such a fearfull Lord) Take courage, and perswade thy selfe I will: No wounding sword thy blood should euer spill. Moreouer, that I may thy wish prevent, Here will I fix thy lasting monument: That thou by her thou lou'st mayst still be seene; And with her Spouse's image cheare our Queene. Then, on that side Medusa, the daughter of PhorcusPhorcynis head doth place, To which the Prince had turn'd his trembling face. And as from thence his eyes he would haue throwne, His neck grew stiffe: his teares congeale to stone. With fearfull suppliant looks, submissiue hands, And guiltie countenance the Statue stands. Victorious Perseus, of Abas his grandfather. Abantiades now hyes Prætvs. T'his natiue Citie, with the rescu'd prize: There, vengeance takes on Prœtus, and restor'd His Grand-father; whose wrongs redresse implor'd. For Prœtus had by force of Armes expeld Acrisius.His brother; and vsurped Argos held. But him, nor Armes, nor Bulwarks, could protect Against the snaky Monsters grim aspect. Yet not the vertue of the Youth, which shone Polydectes. Through so great toyle, nor sorrowes vnder-gone; With thee, See the Comment. ô Polydectes, King of small Sea-girt Seriphus, could prevaile at all. Endlesse thy wrath, thy hate inexorable: Detracting; and condemning for a fable Medusa's death. The moued Youth replies: The truth your selfe shall see; Friends, shut your eyes. Then, represents Medusa to his view: Who presently a bloodlesse Statue grew. Thus long Pallas; of the lake Triton; or of Tritogenia, her excellent wisdome.

Vrania answered, what cause So-ever you to this our Mansion drawes, You are most wel-come. What you heard is true: And from that Pegasus this Fountaine grew. Then Pallas to the sacred Spring convay'd, Shee admires the waters by the horse-hoofe made; Survay's their high-grown-groues, coole caues, fresh bowrs; And meadowes painted with all sorts of flowers: Then happy stiles shee the The Muses: long after these times so named in honour of Homer, who was called Mæonides of Mæonius, his great vnkle and Tutor. Some think that the word is mis-written, and should hee Myonides, of Myrnia a citty of Phocis Mæonides, Both for their Arts, and such aboads as these. O heavenly Virgin, one of them reply'd, Pyrenevs Most worthy our society to guide, If so your actiue vertue did not moue To greater deeds: deseru'dly you approue Our studies, pleasant seat, and happy state, Were we secure from what we chiefly hate.

It now held vp: the vanquisht South-winds flie Before the North; which purge the duskie skie. Prest to depart: he shuts the doores; prepares To offer force: with wings we scape his snares. He presently the highest tower ascends; And, as he would haue flowne, his body bends: The way you goe, said he, will I pursew; And from the battlements himselfe he threw: Who falling, strikes the earth with dasht out-braines; Which with his wicked blood, he dying, staines. The Muse yet spake: when, wings were heard to clatter; And from high trees saluting voices chatter. Ioue's daughter wonders, &amp; enquires from whence Those voices came, including humane sense. Not men, but nine all-imitating Pies; Bewailing their deserued destinies. The Goddesse to th'admiring Goddesse said: They, foyl'd by vs, by vs were thus repai'd. The contention betvveene the Mvses and the Pierides. Pierus, who rich Pella held by lot, These on Pœonian Euippe got.

A shame it was to striue: more shame it were To yeeld. The Nymphs by their owne rivers sweare: And sit on benches made of liuing stone. Then, vn-elected, rudely stept forth one; Who sung the Giants warre: their fayned acts Typhon Shee magnifies; and from the Gods detracts. How The son of Tellus and Tartarus, called also Typhæus. Typhon, from earth's gloomy entrailes rais'd, Struck all their powr's with feare: who fled amaz'd, Till Ægypts scorched soyle the weary hides; And wealthy Nile, who in seuen channels glides.

The Rape of Proserpina.Not farre remou'd from Enna's high-built wall, A Lake there is, which men Pergusa call. Cäyster's slowly-gliding waters beare Far fewer singing Swans then are heard there. Woods crown the Lake, and cloath it round about With leauy veils, which Phœbus beames keep-out. The trees creat fresh ayre, th' Earth various flowres: Where heat nor cold th' eternall Spring devoures. Whil'st in this groue Proserpina disports, Or Violets pulls, or Lillies of all sorts; And while she stroue with childish care and speed To fill her lap, and others to exceed; Pluto. Dis saw, affected, carried her away, Almost at once. Loue could not brooke delay. The sad-fac't Goddesse cryes (with feare appall'd) To her Companions; oft her Mother call'd. And as shee tore th' adornment of her haire, Downe fell the flowr's which in her lap she bare. And such was her sweet Youth's simplicity, That their losse also made the Virgin crie. The Ravisher flies on swift wheeles; his horses Excites by name, and their full speed inforces: Shaking for haste the rust-obscured raignes Vpon their cole-black necks, and shaggy maines. Through Lakes, through Hot lakes by Palica a city of Sicilia, which spouted vp their waters three cubit high. the Palici which expire A sulphrous breath; through earth ingendring fire, They passe to where Corinthian Bacchides Siracusa; built by Archias. the sonne of Bacchus, the exiled Corinthian.His Citty built The greater and lesser Haven, which make the site of the Citty a Pen-insula. betweene vnequall Seas. The Land 'twixt A fountaine in a little Iland almost adioining to the vtter extent of Siracusa; and divided from Cyane by the greater harbour. Arethusa and Cyane With stretcht-out hornes begirts th' included Sea. Here Cyane, who gaue the Lake a name, Amongst Sicilian Nymphs of speciall fame, Her head advanc't: who did the Goddesse knowe? And boldly said, You shall not farther goe; Nor can you be vnwilling Ceres son: What you compell, perswasion should haue won. Cyane. If humble things I may compare with great; Fained mutuall Lovers, in that their waters vnite, and runne together into the haven of Siracusa. Anapis lou'd me: yet did he intreat; And me, not frighted thus, espous'd. This said, With out-stretcht armes his farther passage staid. His wrath no longer Pluto could restraine; But giues his terror-striking Steeds the raigne; And with his Regall mace, through the profound And yeelding water, cleaues the solid ground: The breach t'infernall The depth of Hell so called in that all things there are in distemper and confusion. Tartarus extends: At whose darke jawes the Chariot descends. But Cyane the Goddesse Rape laments; And her owne iniur'd Spring; whose discontents Admit no comfort: in her heart she beares Her silent sorrow: now, resolues to teares; And with that Fountaine doth incorporate, Whereof th' immortall Deitie but late. Her softned members thaw into a dewe Her nailes lesse hard, her bones now limber grew The slendrest parts first melt away: her haire, Fine fingers, legs, and feet; that soone impaire, And drop to streames: then, armes, backe, shoulders, side, And bosome, into little Currents glide. Water, in stead of blood, fils her pale veines: And nothing now, that may be graspt, remaines. Mean-while, through all the earth, and all the Maine The fearefull Ceres Mother sought her childe in vaine. Not dewy-hair'd Aurora, when she rose, Nor The Evening starre. Hesperus, could witnesse her repose. Two pitchy Pines at flaming Ætna lights; And restlesse, carries them through freesing Nights: Againe, when Day the vanquisht Starres supprest, Her vanisht comfort seekes from East to West. Abas Thirsty with travell, and no Fountaine nye, A cottage thatcht with straw, invites her eye. At th' humble gate she knocks: Matanira; An old wife showes Her selfe thereat; and seeing her, bestowes The water so desir'd; which she before Had boyl'd with barly. Drinking at the doore; Abas.A rude hard-fauour'd Boy beside her stood, Who laught, and cald her greedy-gut. Her blood Inflam'd with anger, what remayn'd she threw Full in his face; which forthwith speckled grew. His armes convert to legs; a taile withall Spines from his changed shape: of body small, Lest he might proue too great a foe to life: Though lesse, yet like a Lizard, th' aged wife (That wonders, weeps, and feares to touch it) shunnes, And presently into a crevise runnes. Fit to his colour they Stellio, which wee call an Evet. a name elect; With sundry little starres all-ouer speckt. What Lands, what Seas, the Goddesse wandred through Were long to tell: Earth had not roome enough. To Sicil she returnes: where ere she goes, Inquires; and came where Cyane now flowes. Shee, had shee not beene changed, all had told; Now, wants a tongue her knowledge to vnfold: Yet, to the mother, of her daughter gaue A certaine signe: who bore vpon a waue Proserpina, the one the Greeke name, and the other the Latin. Persephone's rich zone; that from her fell, When, through the sacred Spring, shee sunke to hell. This seene, and knowne; as but then lost, she tare, Without selfe-pitty, her dis-sheueled haire; And with redoubled blowes her brest invades: Nor knowes what Land t'accuse, yet all vpbraids; Ingrate, vnworthy with her gifts t'abound: Sicilia; of her three Promontories. Trinacria chiefly; where the steps she found Of her misfortunes. Therefore there shee brake The furrowing plough; the Oxe and owner strake Both with one death; then, bade the fields beguile The trust impos'd, shrunk seed corrupts. That soile, So celebrated for fertilitie, Now barren grew: corne in the blade doth die. Now, too much drouth annoy's; now, lodging showres: Stars smitch, winds blast. The greedy fowle devoures The new-sowne graine: Kintare, and Darnell tire The fetter'd Wheat; and Quitch that through it spire. In Elean waues Arethusa: see the Comment Alphæus Loue appear'd; And from her dropping haire her fore-head clear'd: O Mother of that far-sought Maid, thou friend To life, said she; here let thy labour end: Nor be offended with thy faithfull Land; That blamelesse is, nor could her Rape with-stand. I, here a guest, not for my Country plead: See the Comment.My Country Pisa is, in Elis bred; And, as an Alien, in Sicilia; of the Sicani, a people of Spaine, who planted divers Colonies in that Iland. Sicania dwell: But yet no Country pleaseth me so well. I, Arethusa, now these Springs possesse: This is my seat: which, courteous Goddesse, blesse. Why I affect this place, A little Iland at the farthest extent of Siracusa, wherein in the fountaine Arethusa. t' Ortygia came Through such vast Seas; I shall impart the same To your desire; when you, more fit to heare, Shall quit your care, and be of better cheare. Earth giues me way: through whose darke cauernes roll'd; I here ascend; and long-mist starres behold. While vnder ground by Styx my waters glide, Your sweet Proserpina I there espy'd. Full sad she was: euen then you might haue seene Feare in her face: and yet she is a Queene; And yet shee in that gloomy Empire swayes; And yet her will th' infernall King obayes. Stone-like stood Ceres at this heavy newes; And, staring, long continued in a muse. When griefe had quickned her stupidity, Shee tooke her Chariot, and ascends the skie: There, veiled all in clouds, with scattered haire, Shee kneeles to Iupiter, and made this pray'r. Both for my blood and thine, ô Ioue, I sue: If I be nothing gracious, yet doe you A Father to your Daughter proue; nor be Your care the lesse, because she sprung from me. Lo, she at length is found, long sought through all The spacious World; if you a Finding call What more the losse assures: but if, to knowe Her being, be to Finde, I haue found her so. And yet I would the iniurie remit, So he the stolne restore: 'Twere most vnfit That holy Marriage, or the God of Nuptials. Hymen should thy daughter ioyne Vnto a Thiefe; although she were not mine. Then Ioue: the pledge is mutuall, and these cares To either equall: Yet this deed declares Much loue, mis-called Wrong: nor should we shame Of such a sonne, could you but thinke the same. All wants suppose, can he be lesse then great, And be Ioue's brother? What, when all compleat? I, The three sons of Saturne divided the world among themselues by lots. but preferr'd by lot? Or if you burne In endlesse spleene; Let Proserpine returne: On this condition, That shee yet haue ta'ne No sustenance: so Destinies ordaine. Ascalaphvs. To fetch her daughter, Ceres posts in haste: But, Fates with-stood: the Maid had broke her fast. For, wandring in the Ort-yard, simply shee Pluckt a Pomegrannet from the stooping Tree; Thence tooke seven graines and eats them one by one: Obserued by The name signifies an accuser.

His head o're-sizd, his long nailes talons proue; His winged armes for lazinesse scarce moue: A filthy, ever ill-presaging Fowle, To Mortals ominous: a screeching Owle. Sirens.Yet was the punishment no more then due To his offence. But how offended you The Sirens, daughters to Achelous. Acheloides, that wings and clawes disgrace Your goodly formes, yet keepe your Virgin-face? Was it, you Sirens, that your deathlesse Powers Were with the Goddesse when she gathered flowrs? Whom when through all the Earth you sought in vaine, You wisht for wings to fly vpon the Maine; That pathlesse Seas might testifie your care: The easie Gods consented to your pray'r. Streight, golden feathers on your backs appeare: But, lest that musick, fram'd to inchant the eare, And so great gifts of speech should be profan'd; Your Virgin-lookes, and humane voyce remayn'd. But Ioue, Ceres. his sister's discontent to cheare, Betweene her and Pluto. his Brother parts the yeare. The Goddesse now in either Empire swayes: Six months with Ceres, six with Pluto stayes. Proserpina then chang'd her minde, and looke (Late such as sullen Pluto. Dis could hardly brooke) And clear'd her browes; as The Sunne. Sol, obscur'd in shrowds Of exhalations, breaks through vanquisht clowds. Pleas'd Ceres now bade Arethusa tell Her cause of flight: In Ortygia: all fountaines being consecrated to Nymphs, but this in particular to Diana, for her rescue. and why a sacred Well? Th' obsequious waters left their murmuring: The Goddesse then aboue the Crystall Spring Her head advanc't; and, wringing her greene haires, Shee thus Alphæus ancient loue declares. I, of Achaia once a Nymph: none more Alphævs and Arethvsa.The Chace affected, or t'intoyle the Bore. By beautie though I never sought for fame; Though masculine; of faire I bare the name. Nor tooke I pleasure in my praysed face, Which others valew as their only grace: But, simple, was ashamed to excell; And thought it infamy to please too-well. As from Of Stymphalus, a citty of Arcadia, Stymphalian woods I made retreat ('Twas hot, and labour had increast the heat) When well-nigh tyr'd; a silent streame I found, All eddilesse, perspicuous to the ground: Through which you every pebble might haue seene; And ran, as if it had no River beene. The Poplar, and the hoary Willow, fed By bordring streames, their gratefull shadow spred, In this coole Rivulet my foot I dipt; Then knee-deepe wade: nor so content, vnstript My selfe forth-with; vpon a Sallow stud My robe I hung, and leapt into the flood. Where, while I swim, and labour to and fro A thousand waies, with armes that swiftly row, I from the bottome heard an vnknowne tongue; And frighted, to the hither margent sprung. Whither so fast, ô Arethusa! twice Out-cry'd Alphæus, with a hollow voice. Vnclothed as I was, I fled for feare (For, on the other side my garments were) The faster followed he, the more did burne; Who naked, seeme the readier for his turne. As trembling Doues the eager Hawkes eschew; As eager Hawkes the trembling Doues pursew; I fled, He followed. To Orchomenus, Psophis, Cyllene, high-brow'd Mænalaus, Cold Erymanthus, and to Elis, I My flight maintayned; nor could he come ny: But, far vnable to hold out so long; He, patient of much labour, and more strong. And yet o're Plaines, o're woody hills I fled, And craggy Rocks, where foot did never tread. The Sunne was at our backs: before my feet I saw his shadow; or my feare did see't. How-ere his sounding steps, and thick drawne breath That fann'd my haire, affrighted me to death. Starke tyr'd, I cry'd: Ah caught! help (ô forlorne!) Diana helpe thy Squire, who oft haue borne Thy Bowe and Quiver! Mou'd at my request, With muffling clowds shee couer'd the distrest. The River seekes me in that pitchy shrowd, And searches round about the hollow clowd: Twice came to where Diana me did hide; And twice he Here an interiection of calling, as ho, or holla. Iö Arethusa cry'd. Then what a heart had I! the Lamb so feares When howling Wolues about the Fold she heares: So Heartlesse Hare, when trayling Hounds draw nye Her sented Forme; nor dares to moue an eye. Nor went he on, in that he could not trace My further steps; but guards the clowd and place. Cold sweats my then-besieged limbs possest: In thin thick-falling drops my strength decreast. Where-ere I step, streames run; my haire now fell In trickling deaw; and, sooner then I tell My destinie, into a Flood I grew. The Riuer his beloued waters knew; And, putting off th' assumed shape of man, Resumes his owne; and in my Current ran. Chaste Diana; of Delos, where shee was borne. Delia cleft the ground. Then, through blind caues, To lou'd Diana imposed that name on this little Siracusian Iland: she her selfe being called Ortygia of Ortygia the ancient name of Delos. Ortygia she conducts my waues; Affected for her name: where first I take Review of day. This, Arethusa spake. The fertill Goddesse to her Chariot chaines Triptolemvs.Her yoked Dragons, checkt with stubborne raignes: Her course, 'twixt heaven and earth, to Athens bends; And to Triptolemus her Chariot sends.

The Nymphs of Tmolus oft their Vines forsooke; The sleeke Pactolian Nymphs their streames; to looke On her rare workes: nor more delight in viewing The done (done with such grace) then when adoing. Whether she orbe-like roule the ruder wooll; Or, finely finger'd, the selected cull; Or draw it into clowd-resembling flakes; Or equall twine with swift-turn'd spindle makes; Or with her liuely-painting needle wrought: You might perceiue she was by Pallas taught. Yet such a Mistresse her proud thoughts disclame: Let her with me contend; if foyld, no shame (Said she) nor punishment will I refuse. Pallas, forth-with, an old-wiues shape indues: Her haire all white; her limbs, appearing weake, A staffe supports: who thus began to speake. Old Age hath something which we need nor shun Experience by long tract of time is won. Scorne not advice: with dames of humane race Contend for fame, but giue a Goddesse place.

They put them off; the sacrifice forbore: And yet Latona silently adore. As much as free from barrennesse, so much Disdaine and griefe th' inraged Goddesse touch. Who on the top of A mountaine of Delos. Cynthus thus beginnes To vent her passion to her sacred Twins. Lo I, your mother, proud in you alone; (Excepting Iuno, second vnto none) Am question'd if a Goddesse: and must loose, If you assist not, all religious dews. Nor is this all: that curst Niobe. Tantalian Seede Adds foule reproaches to her impious deed. She dares her children before you prefer; And calls me childlesse: may it light on her! Whose wicked words Who being called to the Festivals and Counsells of the Gods: revealed their secrets, her fathers tongue declare. About to second her report with prayer; Peace, Phœbus said, complaint too long delayes Conceau'd revenge: the same vext Phœbe sayes. Then swiftly through the yeelding ayre they glide To Thebes: first erected by Cadmus. Cadmus towres; in clouds their glories hide. A spacious plaine before the city lyes, Made dusty with the daily exercise Of trampling hooues; by strifefull Chariots trackt. Part of Amphions actiue sons here backt High-bounding steeds; whose rich caparison With scarlet blusht, with gold their bridles shone. Ismenus, from her womb who first did spring, As with his ready horse he beats a ring, And checks his fomy jawes; ay me! out cryes; While through his groaning brest an arrow flyes. His bridle slackning with his dying force, He leasurely sinks side-long from his horse. Next, Siphilus from clashing quiver flies With slackned raignes: as when a Pilot spies A growing storme; and, least the gentle gaile Should scape besides him, claps on all his saile. His haste th'vneuitable bowe o're-took, And through his throat the deadly arrow strook. Who, by the horses mane and speedy thighes Drops headlong, and the earth in purple dies. Now Phœdimus; and Tantalus, the heire T'his Grand-sires name; that labour done, prepare To wrastle. Whilst with oyled limbs they prest Each others power, close grasping brest to brest; A shaft, which from th'impulsiue bow-string flew. Them, in that sad Conjunction ioyntly slew. Both grone at once, at once their bodies bend With bitter pangs, at once to earth descend: Their rowling eyes together set in death; Together they expire their parting breath. In rusht Alphenor (bleeding in their harmes) And raised their heatlesse corses in his armes: But in that pious dutie fell. The threds Of life, his heart-strings wrathfull Apollo; of Delos; where hee was borne, and had his Temple. Delius shreds. Part of his lungs claue to th'extracted head: And with his blood his troubled spirit fled. But vnshorne Damasichthon slaughtred lies Not by a single wound: shot where the thighes Knit with the ham-strings in the knotty ioint. Striuing from thence to tug the fatall point, Another at his neck the bow directs. Thick-gushing blood the piercing shaft eiects; Which spinning vpward cleft the passiue ayre. Last Ilioneus, with succeslesse prayer, His hands vp-heaues: You Gods in generall Said he (and ignorantly pray'd to all) O pitty me! The Apollo. Archer had remorce; But now irrevocable was that force: And yet his life a little wound dispatcht, His heart but onely with the arrow scratcht. Ill newes, the peoples griefe, her housholds teares Present their ruine to their mothers eares: Who wonders how the Gods their liues durst touch; And swels with anger that their powre was such. For sad Amphion, wounding his owne brest, Had now his sorrow, with his soule releast. How different is this Niobe from that! Who great Latona's Rites supprest of late, And proudly pac't the streets; enui'd by those That were her friends; now pittied by her foes! Frantick she doth on their cold corses fall, And her last kisses distributes to all. From whom, to heaven erecting her bruz'd armes: Cruell Latona, feast thee with our harmes: Feast, feast, she said, thy saluage stomack cloy; Cloy thy wild rage, and in our sorrow joy: Seauen times, vpon seauen Herses borne, I dy. Triumph, triumph, victorious foe. But why Victorious? haplesse I haue not so few: Who, after all these funeralls, subdew. This said, the bow-string twangs. Pale terror chils All hearts saue Niobes; obdur'd by ills. The sisters, in long mourning robes array'd, About their herses stood, with haire display'd. One drawes an arrow from her brothers side; And joyning her pale lips to his, so dide. Another striuing to asswage the woes That rackt her mother, forth-with speechlesse growes: And bowing with the wound, which inly bled, Shuts her fixt teeth; the soule already fled. This, flying falls: that, her dead sister makes Her bed of death: this, hides her selfe: that quakes. Six slaine by sundry wounds; to shield the last, Her mother, ouer her, her body cast, This one, she cryes, and that the least, ô saue! The least of many, and but one, I craue! Whilst thus she sues, the su'd-for Diana: of the Iland ?Delos? where she was borne. Delia hits. Shee, by her husband, sons, and daughters, sits A childlesse widdow; waxing stiffe with woes. The winde wags not one haire; the ruddy rose Forsakes her cheeke: in her declining head Her eye-balls fix: through-out appearing dead. Her tongue, and pallat rob'd of inward heat At once congeale: her pulse forbeares to beat: Her neck wants power to turne, her feet to goe, Her armes to moue: her very bowels grow Into a stone. She yet retaines her teares. Whom straight a whirle-winde to her country beares; And fixes on the summit of Siphylus: so fained, because the marble of that Mountaine is much giuen to sweat through the moisture of the aire. a hill. Now from that mourning marble teares distill. Th'exemplary revenge struck all with feare: Who offerings to Latona's altars beare With doubled zeale. When, Of the Thebans, which sacrificed to Latona. one as oft befalls, By present accidents the past recalls. Lycian Pesants.In fruitfull Lycia once, said he, there dwelt A sort of Pesants, who her vengeance felt. 'Twas of no note, in that the men were base: Yet wonderfull. I saw the poole, and place, Fam'd by the prodigie. My father, spent Almost with age, ill brooking travell, sent Me thither for choice Steeres: and for my Guide A Lycian.A natiue gaue. Those pastures searcht, we spy'd An ancient Altar, black with cinders, plac't Amidst a Lake, with shiuering reeds imbrac't. O favour me! he, softly murmuring, said: O fauour me! I, softly murmuring, praid: Then askt, if Nymph, or Faune therein reside, Or rurall God. The Lycian thus reply'd. O youth, no mountaine Powres this altar hold: Latona.She calls it hers, to whom Ioues wife, of old, Earth interdicted: scarce that floting Ile, Waue-wandring Delos, finisht her exile. Where, coucht on Palmes and Oliues, she in spight Of fretfull Iuno, brought her Apollo and Diana. Twins to light. Thence also, frighted from her painfull bed, With her two infant Deities she fled. Now in A Monster, with the head of a Lyon, the body of a Gote, and the taile of a Serpent. Of this hereafter. Chimæra-breeding Lycia (fir'd By burning beames) and with long travell tyr'd, Heat raising thirst the Goddesse sore opprest: By their exhausting of her milke increast. By fortune, in a dale, with longing eyes A Lake of shallow water she descries: Where Clownes were then a gathering picked weeds, With shrubby Osiers, and plash-louing reeds. Approacht; Latona: daughter to Cæus, one of the Titans. Titania kneeles vpon the brinke: And of the cooling liquor stoops to drinke. The Clownes with-stood. Why hinder you, said she, The vse of water, that to all is free? The Sun, aire, water, Nature did not frame Peculiar; a publick gift I clame. Yet humbly I intreat it: not to drench My weary lims, but killing thirst to quench. My tongue wants moisture, and my iawes are drie: Scarce is there way for speech. For drink I die. Water to me were Nectar. If I liue; 'Tis by your fauour: life with water giue. Pitty these babes: for pitty they advance Their little armes! their armes they stretcht by chance: With whom would not such gentle words prevaile? But they, persisting to prohibit, raile; The place with threats command her to forsake. Then with their hands and feet disturbe the lake: And leaping with malicious motion, moue The troubled mud; which rising, flotes aboue. Rage quencht her thirst: no more Latona sues To such base slaues: but Goddesse-like doth vse Her dreadfull tongue; which thus their fates imply'd: May you for euer in this lake reside! Her wish succeeds. In loued lakes they striue; Now sprawle aboue, now vnder water diue; Oft hop vpon the banke, as oft againe Back to the water: nor can yet restraine Their brawling tongues; but setting shame aside, Though hid in water, vnder water chide. Their voyces still are hoarce: the breath they fetch Swels their wide throtes; their iawes with railing stretch: Their heads their shoulders touch; no neck betweene, As intercepted. All the back is greene: Their bellies (euery part o're-sizing) white. Who now, new Frogs, in slimy pooles delight. Thus much, I know not by what Theban, said: Marsyas. An other mention of a Satyre made, By Phœbus, with Minerva's Pipe, whereon Marsyas the Satyre played. See the comment. Tritonia's reede, o're-come: Who for presuming felt a heauy doome. The words of Marsyas.Me from my selfe, ah why doe you distract? (Oh!) I repent, he cry'd: Alas! this fact Deserues not such a vengeance! Whilst he cry'd; Apollo from his body stript his hide. His body was one wound, blood every way Streames from all parts: his sinewes naked lay. His bare veines pant: his heart you might behold; And all the fiuers in his brest haue told. For him the Faunes, that in the forrests keepe; For him the Nymphs, and brother Satyres weepe: His end, An excellent Piper remembred by Plato, and beloued of Marsyas, of whom that mountaine in Mysia was so called. Olympus (famous then) bewailes; With all the shepherds of those hills and dales. The pregnant Earth conceiueth with their teares; Which in her penetrated womb she beares, Till big with waters: then discharg'd her fraught. This purest Phrygian Streame a way out sought By down-falls, till to toyling seas he came: Now called Marsyas of the Satyres name. Pelops.The Vulgar, these examples told, returne Vnto the present: for Amphion mourne, And his lost issue. All the mother hate. The son of Tantalus: and brother to Niobe. Pelops alone laments his sisters fate. While with torne garments he presents his woes, The iuory peece on his left shoulder showes. This once was flesh, and coloured like the right. Slaine by his Sire, the Gods his lims vnite: His scattered parts all found; saue that alone Which interpos'd the neck and shoulder bone. They then with iuory supply'd th'vnfound: And thus restored Pelops was made sound. The neighbouring princes met: the Cities neare Intreat their kings the To condole with Pelops for the death of his sister, and the Theban Princes. desolate to cheare.

Th'ill boading Owle vpon the roofe was set. Progne and Tereus with these omens met: Thus parents grew. The Thracians yet reioyce; And thanke the Gods with one vnited voyce. The marriage day, and that of Itys birth, They consecrate to vniuersall mirth. So lyes the good vnseene. By this the Sun, Conducting Time, had through fiue Autums run: When flattering Progne thus allures her Lord. If I haue any grace with thee, afford This favour, that I may my sister see: Send me to her, or bring thou her to me. Promise my father that with swiftest speede She shall returne. If this attempt succeede; The summe of all my wishes I obtaine. He bids them lanch his ships into the maine: Then makes th'Athenian port with sailes and ores; And lands vpon the wisht Piræus was the Hauen to Athens; so called of the adioyning premontory. Piræan shores. Brought to Pandion's presence, they salute. The King with bad presage begins his sute. For loe, as he his wifes command recites, And for her quick returne his promise plights, Bright Philomela came in rich array; Philomela. More rich in beauty. So they vse to say Nymphs of fountaines and woods.The stately Naiades, and Dryad's goe In Syluan shades; were they apparel'd so. This sight in Tereus such a burning breeds, As when we fire a heap of hoary reeds; Or catching flames to Sun-dry'd stubble thrust. Her face was excellent: but in-bred lust Inrag'd his blood; to which those The Thracians, a warlike people, were much addicted to Venus; and gloried in the multitude of their wiues, as recorded by Mela and Solinus, Climes are prone: Stung by his countries fury, and his owne. He streight intends her women to intice, And bribe her Nurse to prosecute his vice; Her selfe to tempt with gifts; his crowne to spend: Or rauish, and by warre his rape defend. What dares he not, thrust on by wilde desire? Nor can his brest containe so great a fire. Rackt with delay, he Progne's sute renewes: And for himselfe, that but pretended sues. Loue made him eloquent. As oft as he Exceeded, he would say. Thus charged she. And mouing teares (as she had sent them) sheds. You Gods! how dark a blindnesse ouer-spreds The soules of men! whilst to his sin he climes, They thinke him good; and praise him for his crimes. Euen Philomela wisht the same! now she Hangs on her fathers neck: and what would be Her vtter ruine, as her safety prest: While Tereus by beholding pre-possest. Her kisses and imbraces heat his blood: And all afford his fire and fury food. And wisht, as oft as she her Sire imbrac't, Him-selfe her Sire: nor would haue beene more chast. He, by their importunities is wrought. She, ouer-ioy'd, her father thankes: and thought Her selfe and sister in that fortunate, Which drew on both a lamentable fate. The labour of the Day now neere an end, From steepe Heaven: of the hight of that Mountaine, euer in the Sun-shine. Olympus Phœbus steeds descend. The boards are princely seru'd: A name of Bacchus: here taken for wine. Lyæus flowes In burnisht gold. Then take their soft repose. And yet Tereus: of Odrysa, a Citty of Thrace. th'Odrysian King, though parted, fries: Her face and graces euer in his eyes. Who parts vnseene vnto his fancy faines; And feeds his fires: Sleep flies his troubled braines. Day rose: Pandion his departing son Wrings by the hand; and weeping, thus begun. Deare Son, since Piety this due requires; With her, receaue both your and their desires. By faith, aliance, by the Gods aboue, I charge you guard her with a fathers loue: And suddenly send back (for all delay To me is death) my ages onely stay. And Daughter ('tis enough thy sister's gone) For pitty leaue me not too long alone. As he impos'd this charge, he kist with-all: And drops of teares at euery accent fall. The pledges then of promis'd faith demands (Which mutually they giue) their plighted hands. To Progne, and her little boy, said he, My loue remember, and salute from me. Scarce could he bid farewell: sobs so ingage His troubled speech; who dreads his soules presage. As soone as shipt; as soone as actiue ores Had mou'd the surges, and remou'd the shores; She's ours! with me my wish I beare! he cryes. Exults; and barbarous, scarce defers his ioyes: His eyes fast fixt. As when Ioues eagle beares A Hare t'her Ayery, truss't in rapefull seares: And to the trembling prisoner leaues no way: For hoped flight; but still beholds her pray. The voyage made; on his owne land he treads: And to a Lodge Philomela. Pandions daughter leads; Obscur'd with woods: pale, trembling full of feares; And for her sister asking now with teares. There mues her vp; his foule intent makes knowne: Inforc't her; a weake virgin, and but one. Helpe father! sister helpe! in her distresse She cries; and on the Gods, with like successe. She trembles like a lambe, snatcht from the phangs Of some fell wolfe; that dreads her former pangs: Or as a doue, who on her feathers beares Her bloods fresh staines, and late-felt talants feares. Restor'd vnto her mind, her rufled haire, As at a wofull funerall she tare; Her armes with her owne fury bloody made: Who, wringing her vp-heaued hands, thus said. O monster! barbarous in thy horrid lust! Trecherous Tyrant! whom my fathers trust, Impos'd with holy teares; my sisters loue; My virgin state; nor nuptiall ties, could moue! O what a wild confusion hast thou bred! I, an adultresse to my sisters bed; Thou, husband to vs both; my only hate; And to expect a miserable fate. Why mak'st thou not thy villanies compleat; By forcing life from her abhorred seat? O would thou hadst, e're I my honour lost! Then had I parted with a sportlesse ghost. Yet, if the Gods haue eyes; if their Powers be Not meerely names; nor all decay with me; Thou shalt not scape due vengeance. Sense of shame I will abandon; and thy crime proclaime: To men, if free; if not, my voice shall breake Through these thick walls; and teach the woods to speake: Hard rockes resolue to ruth. Let heauen this heare; And Heauen-thron'd Gods: if there be any there! These words the saluage Tyrant moues to wroth: Nor lesse his feare: a like provok't by both. Who drawes his sword: his cruell hands he winds In her loose haire: her arms behind her binds. Her throte glad Philomela ready made: Conceiuing hope of death from his drawne blade. Whilst she reviles, invokes her father; sought To vent her spleene; her tongue in pincers caught, His sword devideth from the panting root: Which, trembling, murmurs curses at his foot. And as a serpents taile, disseuer'd, Leaps: Euen so her tongue: and dying sought her steps After this fact (if we may rumor trust) He oft abus'd her body with his lust. Yet to his wife, euen after this, retires: Who for her sister hastily inquires. He funeralls belyes, with fained griefe: And by instructed teares begets beliefe. Progne her royall ornaments reiects; And puts on black: an As they anciently vsed or the absent: in some sort observed by Princes at this dy. empty tombe erects; To her imagin'd Ghost oblations burnes: Her sisters fate, As dead, and not as dishonoured. not as she should, she mournes. Now through twelue Signes the sun had borne his light. What should sad Philomela doe? her flight A barbarous guard restrain'd; the walls were strong; Her mouth had lost the Index of her wrong. The wit that misery begets is great: Great sorrow addes a quicknesse to conceit. A woofe vpon a Thracian loome she spreds; And inter-weaues the white with crimson threds; That character her wrong. The closely wrought, Gaue to a servant, By signes. by her looks besought To beare it to her Progne. Mistresse: who presents The Queene therewith; not knowing the contents. The wife to that dire Tyrant this vnfolds: And in a wofull verse her state beholds. She held her peace: 'twas strange! griefe struck her mute. No language could with such a passion sute. Nor had she time to weepe. Right, wrong, were mixt In her fell thoughts: her soule on vengeance fixt. It was that time; when, in a wild disguise, Thracian; or Sithonia a province of Thrace. Sithonian matrons vse to solemnise Trieterica Bacchi; Lyœus three-yeares Feast. Night spreds her wings: By night high A mountaine of Thrace. Rhodope with timbrels rings. By night th'impatient Queene a iauelin takes, And now a Bacchanal, the Court forsakes. Vines shade her browes: the rough hide of a Deare Shogs at her side: her shoulder beare a speare. Hurried through woods, with her attendant froes, Terrible Progne, frantick with her woes, Thy farre more sober fury, Bacchus striues To counterfeit. Now at the lodge arriues: Howles; An acclamation in vse with the Bacchides: signifying, wee wish thee well. Euohe, cries: breakes ope the doores, and tooke Her sister thence: with iuy hides her looke: In habit of a Bacchanal arrayd: And to her Citty the amaz'd convayd. That hated roofe when Philomela knew; The poore soule shooke; her visage bloodlesse grew. Progne with-drawes; the sacred weeds vnlos'd; Her wofull sisters bashfull face disclos'd: Falls on her neck. The other durst not raise Her downe-cast eyes: her sisters wrong survayes In her dishonour. As she stroue t'haue sworne With vp-raisd lookes; and call the Gods t'haue borne Her pure thoughts witnesse, how she was compeld To that loth'd fact; she hands, for speech, vpheld. Sterne Progne broiles; her bosome hardly beares So vast a rage: who chides her sisters teares. No teares, said she, our lost condition needs: But steele; or if thou hast what steele exceeds. I, for all horrid practises, am fit: To wrap this roofe in flame, and him in it: His eyes, his tongue, or what did thee inforce, T'extirp; or with a thousand wounds, divorce His guilty soule. The deede I intend, is great: But what, as yet, I know not. In this heat Came Itys in, and taught her what to doe. Beheld with cruell eyes; Ah, how I view; In thee, said shee, thy father! then intends Her tragick Scene: Rage in her lookes ascends. But when her sonne saluted her, and clung Vnto her neck; mixt kisses, as he hung, With childish blandishments; her, high-wrought blood Began to calme, and rage distracted stood. Teares trickl'd from her eyes by strong constraint. But when he found her resolution faint With too much pittie; her sad sister viewes, And said, while both, her eyes by turnes peruse. Why flatters he? why tonguelesse weepes the other? Why sister calls not she, whom he calls mother? Degenerate! thinke whose daughter; to whom wed: All piety is sinne to Tereus bed. Then Itys trailes: as when by Ganges floods A Tigresse drags a Fawne through silent woods. Retiring to the most sequestred roome: While he, with hands vp-heau'd, fore-sees his doome, Clings to her bosome; mother! mother! cry'd; She stabs him: nor once turn'd her face aside. His throte was cut by Philomela's knife: Although one wound suffic'd to vanquish life. His yet quick lims, ere all his soule could passe, She peece-meale teares. Some boyle in hollow brasse, Some hisse on spits. The pauements blusht with blood. Progne invites her husband to this food: And faines her Countries Rite; which would afford No seruant, nor companion, but her Lord. Now Tereus, mounted on his Grand-fires throne, With his sonnes carued entrailes stuffes his owne: And bids her (so Soule-blinded!) call his boy. Progne could not disguise her cruell ioy: In full fruition of her horrid ire, Thou hast, said she, within thee thy desire. He lookes about: asks where. And while againe He asks, and calls: all bloody with the slaine, Forth like a Fury, Philomela flew; And at his face the head of Itys threw. Nor euer more then now desir'd a tongue; T'expresse the ioy of her revenged wrong. He, with lowd out-cryes, doth the boord repell; And calls the Furies from the depth of hell. Now teares his brest, and striues from thence in vaine To pull th'abhorred food: now weepes amaine. And calls himselfe his sonnes vnhappy tombe. Then drawes his sword; and through the guilty roome Pursues the Sisters; who appeare with wings To cut the ayre: and so they did. Philomela a Nightingall. One sings In woods; the Progne a Swallow. other neare the house remaines: And on her brest yet beares her murders staines. He, swift with griefe and fury, in that space His person chang'd. Long tufts of feathers grace His shining crowne; his sword a bill became; His face all arm'd: whom we a Lapwing name. This killing newes, ere halfe his age was spent, Pandion to th'infernall Shadowes sent. Erichtheus his throne and scepter held: Boreas and Orithya.Who, both in iustice, and bold armes exceld. To him his wife foure sonnes, all hopefull, bare: As many daughters: Orithya and Procris. two, surpassing faire. Thee, Cephalus, thy Procris happy made: For the Rape of Philomela.But Thrace and Tereus, Boreas nuptiall stayd. The God belou'd Orithya wanted long; While he put off his powre, to vse his tongue. His sute reiected; horridly inclin'd To anger (too familiar with that Wind.) I iustly suffer this indignity: For why said he, haue I my armes laid by? Strength, violence, high rage and awfull threats. 'Tis my dishonour to haue vs'd intreats. Force me befits. With this, thick clouds I driue; Tosse the blew billowes, knotty Okes vp-riue; Congeale soft snow, and beat the earth with haile. When I The winds were fained to be the sonnes of the Gyant Astræus and Aurora, Of this on the first booke. my brethren in the ayre assaile, (For that's our field) we meete with such a shock, That thundring skyes with our incounters rock, And clowd-struck lightning flashes from on high. When through the crannies of the earth I fly, And force her in her hollow caues, I make The Ghosts to tremble and the ground to quake. Thus should I haue woo'd; with these my match haue made: Erichtheus should haue beene compeld, not pray'd. Thus Boreas chafes; or no lesse storming, shooke His horrid wings; whose ayery motion strooke The earth with blasts, and made the Ocean rore. Trailing his dusky mantle on the flore, He hid himselfe in clouds of dust, and caught Belou'd Orythia, with her feare distraught. Flying, his agitated fires increast: Nor of his ayery race the raignes supprest Till to the walled A People of Thrace. Cicones he came.

What will this proue! Or is it such as others fancie loue? Why seeme the Kings commands so too seuere? And so, in truth they be. Why should I feare A strangers ruine, never seene before? Whence spring these cares? Why feare I more and more? These furies from thy virgin brest repell, Wretch, if thou canst. Could I, I should be well. A new-felt force my striuing powres invades: Affection this, discretion that, perswades. I see the better, I approue it too: The worse I follow. Why shouldst thou pursue A husband of another world; that art Of royall birth? Our country may impart A choice as worthy. If this forrein mate; Or liue, or dye; 'tis in the hands of fate. Yet, may he liue! I such a sute might moue To equall Gods, although I did not loue. For what hath Iason done? his hopefull Youth Would moue all hearts, that were not hard, to ruth; His birth, his valour. Set all these apart; His person would: I feele it moues my heart. Of these hereafter.Yet should not I assist, the flaming breath Of Bulls would blast him; or, assaults of death Spring vp in armes from The element of Earth. Tellus hostill womb: Or else the greedy Dragon proues his tomb. This suffer, and thou hast a heart of stone; Borne of a Tygresse, and more saluage growne. Yet why stand I not by? behold him slaine? And so my accessary eyes profane? Adde fury to the Bulls? to The armed men which ascended from the Earth. th' Earth-borne ire? And sleeplesse Dragon with more spleene inspire? The Gods forbid! yet rather helpe, then pray. My fathers kingdome shall I then betray? And saue this stranger, whom I hardly know, That sau'd by me, he should without me goe. Marry another, and leaue me behind To punishment? could he proue so vnkinde, Or for another my deserts neglect; Then should he dye. Such is not his aspect; The clearenesse of his minde; his every grace; That I should fraud suspect, or thinke him base. Besides, before hand he shall plight his troth: And bind the contract by a solemne oath. What need thou doubt? goe on; delay decline: Obliged Iason will be ever thine. The God of marriage. Hymen shall crowne, and mothers celebrate Their sonnes Protectresse through Greece, a part taken for the whole. th' Achaian State.

My loue possest; in Iasons bosome laid; Let seas swell high: I cannot be dismaid While I infold my husband in my armes. Or should I feare; I should but feare his harmes. Callst thou him husband? wilt thou then thy blame Medea, varnish with an honest name? Consider well what thou intendst to doe: And, while thou maist: so foule a crime eschue. Thus she. When Honour, Piety, and Right, Before her stood; and Cupid put to flight. Then goes where The daughter of Perses the son of Apollo, and wife to her vnkle Æta; by whom she had Chalciope and Medea: deified for her knowledg in charme and Magicall simples. Hecates old Altar stood; O're-shadowed by a darke and secret wood. Her broken ardor she had now reclaim'd: Which Iasons presence forth-with re-inflam'd. Her cheeks blush fire: her face with feruor flashes. And as a dying cinder, rak't in ashes, Fed by reviving windes, augmenting, glowes; And tossed, to accustom'd fury growes: So sickly Loue, which late appear'd to dye; New life assum'd from his inflaming eye. Whose lookes by chance more beauty now discouer Then heretofore: you might forgiue the louer. Her eager eyes she rivets on his face; And, frantick, thinkes him of no humane race: Nor could divert her lookes. As he his tongue Began t'vnloose, her faire hand softly wrung, Implor'd her aide, and promis'd her his bed: She answere made, with teares profusely shed. I see to what events m'intentions moue: Nor ignorance deceiues me thus; but loue. I by my cunning will preserue your life: But sweare, that done, to take me to your wife.

The Morrow had the sparkling starres defac't: When all in Marse's field assemble; plac't On circling ridges. Seated on a throne, The iuory-scepter'd King in scarlet shone. From adamant nostrils bras-hoou'd Bulls now cast The God of Fire, here taken for fire it selfe.Fierce Vulcan, and the grasse with vapors blast.

Yet Iason. Æsons Haire Came brauely on: on whom they turne, and stare With terrible aspects; his ruine threat With steele-tipt hornes.

Earth mollifies the poys'nous seeds, which spring; And forth a harvest of new People bring. And as an Embrion, in the womb inclos'd, Assumes the forme of man; within compos'd Through all accomplisht numbers; nor comes forth To breathe in ayre, till his maturer growth: So when the bowels of the teeming Earth Grew great, she gaue mens perfect shapes their birth. And, what's more strange; with them, their armes ascend: Who at Iason, of Æmonia; which is Thessaly. th' Æmonian Youth their lances bend. When this Grecians. th' Achaians saw, they hung the head: And all their courages for terror fled. Even she, who had secur'd him was afraid, When she beheld so many one invade. A chill cold checkes her blood; death lookes lesse pale. And least the hearbs she gaue should chance to faile; Vnheard auxiliarie charmes imparts: And calls th' assistance of her secret Arts. He hurles a massie stone among his foes: Who on themselues convert their deadly blowes. The Earth-borne brothers mutuall wounds destroy, And civill war. The Grecians skip for joy, And throng t'imbrace the Victor. Her the same Affection spurd, but was with-held by shame. Yet that too weake if none had lookt vpon her: Not virtue checkt her, but the wrack of honour. Now, in conceit, shee hugs him in her armes: And thanks the Gods, Hecate, and the infernal Powers. the authors of her charmes.

Yet not one appeares Of those who heretofore your towne possest; When first you entertain'd me for a Guest. Then Æacus, (in sighs his words ascend) A sad beginning had a better end. Would I could vtter all: Day would expire Ere all were told, and t'would your patience tire. Their bones, and ashes, silent graues inclose: And what a treasure perished with those! By Iuno's wrath, a dreadfull pestilence Devour'd our liues: who tooke vniust offence, In that this Ile Ægina, the mother of Æacus, begotten by Iupiter. her Rivalls name profest. While it seem'd humane, and the cause vnguest; So long we death-repelling Physick try'd: But those diseases vanquisht art deride. Heauen first, the earth with thickned vapors shrouds; And lazie heat involues in sullen clouds. Foure pallid moones their growing hornes vnite, And had as oft with-drawne their feeble light; Yet still the death-producing The South wind, which blowing long without raine (as here 4 months together) in the author of Pestilence. Auster blew. Sunke springs, and standing lakes infected grew: Serpents in vntild fields by millions creepe; And in the streames their tainting poysons steepe. Doggs, oxen, sheepe, and salvage beasts first dy: Nor birds can from the swift infection fly. Sad Swaines, amazed, see their oxen shrink Beneath the yoke, and in the furrowes sink. The fleecie flocks with anguish faintly bleat; Let fall their wooll, and pine away with heat. The generous Horse that from the Race of late Return'd with honour, now degenerate, Vnmindfull of the glory of his prize; Grones at his manger and there deedlesse dyes. The Bore forgets his rage: swift feete now faile The Hart: nor Beares the horned Heard assaile. All languish. Woods, fields, paths (no longer beare) Are fild with carkasses, that stench the aire. Which neither dogs, nor greedy fowle (how much To be admir'd!) nor hoary wolues would touch. Falling consume: which deadly Odors bred, That round about their dire contagion spred. Now raues among the wretched country Swaines: Now in our large and populous Citty raignes. At first, their bowels broyle, with fervor stretcht: The symptomes; rednesse, hot wind hardly fetcht. Their fur'd tongues swell; their drie iawes gasp for breath; And with the aire inhale a swifter death. None could indure or couerture, or bed: But on the stones their panting bodies spred. Cold stones could no way mitigate that heat: Euen they beneath those burning burdens sweat. None cure attempt: the sterne disease invades The heartlesse Leech; nor art her author aids. The neere ally'd, whose care the sick attends, Sicken themselues, and dye before their friends. Of remedy they see no hope at all, But onely in approching funerall: All their desires obey: for helpe none care: Help was there none. In shamelesse throngs repaire To springs and wels: there cleaue in bitter strife T'extinguish thirst; but first extinguish life. Nor could th'or'e-charg'd arise; but dying, sink: And of those tainted waters, others drink. The wretches lothe their tedious beds; thence breake With giddy steps. Or, if now growne too weake, Roule on the floore: there quitted houses hate, As guilty of their miserable fate; And, ignorant of the cause, the place accuse: Halfe-Ghosts, they walke, while they their leggs could vse. You might see others on the earthly mourning; Their heauy eyes with dying motion turning: Stretching their armes to heauen, where euer death Surpris'd them, parting with their sigh't-out breath. O what a heart had I! or ought to haue! I loth'd my life, and wisht with them a graue. Which way soever I convert my eye, The breathlesse multitude dispersed lye. Like perisht apples, dropping with the strokes Of rocking windes; or acornes from broad okes. See you yon' Temple, mounted on high staires? 'Tis Iupiters. Who hath not offerd praiers, And slighted incense there! husbands for wiues; Fathers for sons: aud while they pray, their liues Before th'inexorable altars vent; With incense in their hands, halfe yet vnspent! How oft the oxe, vnto the temple brought, While yet the Priest the angry Powers besought, A ceremony among the ancient Pagans.And powr'd pure wine betweene his hornes; fell downe Before the axe had toucht his curled crowne!

The By which their Priests accustomed to divine. Inwards lost their signes of heauens presage; Out-razed by the sterne Diseases rage. The dead before the sacred doores were laid: Before the Altars too; the Gods t'vpbraid.

Or vn-interrd they ly: or else are throwne On Of old they burnt their dead on high Piles of wood, with great expense and solemnity according to the quality of the person. wealthlesse pyles.

Ghosts wander vndeplor'd by sonns or fires: Nor is there roome for tombs, or wood for fires.

Hard by, a goodly Oake, by fortune, stood, Sacred to Ioue; Sprung from that oraculous oake which grew at Dodone, a citty of Epir[illeg.]s. of Dodoneian wood: Graine-gathering Ants there, in long files I saw, Whose little mouthes selfe-greater burthens draw; Keeping their paths along the rugged rine. While I admire their number: O divine, And ever helpfull! giue to me, said I, As many men; who may the dead supply. The trembling oke his lofty top declin'd: And murmured without a breath of wind.

Night came; and Sleepe care-wasted bodies cheard: Before my eyes the selfe-same Oke appeard; So many branches, as before, there were; So many busie Ants those branches beare; So shooke the Oke, and with that motion threw To vnder-earth the graine supporting crue. Greater and greater straight they seeme to sight: To raise themselues from earth, and stand vp-right. Whom numerous feet, black colour, lanknesse leaue: And instantly a humane shape receiue.

I may the truth declare without offence: Though rosie be her cheeks; although she sway The deawy Confines of the night and Day, And Nectar drinke; my Procris all possest: My heart was hers; my tongue her praise profest. I told her of our holy nuptiall ties; Of wedlocks breach; and yet scarce tasted ioyes. Fire-red, she said; thy harsh complaints forbeare: Possesse thy Procris. Though so faire, so deare; Thou'lt wish th' hadst never knowne her, if I know Insuing fate: and angry, lets me goe. Her words I ponderd as I went along: Began to doubt she might my honour wrong. Her youth and beauty tempt me to distrust: Her vertue checks those feares, as most vniust. But I was absent: but Of Aurora. example fed My iealousie: but louers all things dread. I seeke my sorrowes; and with gifts intend To tempt the chaste. Aurora proues a friend To this suspition; and my forme translates. Vnknowne, I enter the Athenian gates; And then my owne. The house from blame was free: In decent order, and perplext for me. Scarce with a thousand sleights I gaind a view: Viewd with astonishment, I scarce pursue My first intent: scarce could I then forbeare Due kisses; scarce not what I was appeare. She still was sad: yet louelier none then she, Even in that sadnesse: sorrowfull for me. How excellent, ô Phocus, was that face, Which could in griefe retaine so sweete a grace? What need I tell how often I assaild Her vexed chastity! how often faild! How often said she! One I only serue: For him, where ever, I my bed preserue. What mad man would such faith haue farther prest, But I? industrious to my owne vnrest. With fervent vowes, and gifts still multiply'd, At length she wauers. False of faith, I cry'd, Thou art disclos'd: I, no adulterer, But thy wrong'd spouse: nor can this tryall erre. She made no answer, prest with silent shame. Th'vnhappy house, and me, far more in blame, Forsaking; man-kind for my sake eschewes: And Dian-like the mountayne chace pursues. Abandon'd hotter flames my blood incense. I pardon beg'd, confessing my offence: And said, Aurora might haue me subdu'd With such inticements, had but she so woo'd.

Who prest, what only might in speed compare; Appeares to catch th' vncaught; and mouthes the aire. My dart I take to aid: which, while I shooke, And on the thong direct my hastie looke To fit my fingers: looking vp againe, I saw two marble statues on the plaine.

When The Sunne Sol had rais'd his beames aboue the floods; My custome was to trace the leavy woods. Arm'd with this dart, I solitary went, Without horse, huntsmen, toyles, or dogs of sent. Much kild; I to the cooler shades repaire: And where the vallie breathes a fresher aire. Coole aire I seeke, while all with fervor gloes: Coole aire expect, the cause of my repose. Come aire, I vse to sing, relieue th' opprest; Come, ô most welcome, glide into my brest: Now quench, as erst, in me this scalding heat. By chance I other blandishments repeat; (So Fates inforce) as, ô my soules delight! By thee I am fed and chear'd: thy sweets excite My affections to these woods: ô may thy breath Still mix with mine, and so preserue from death! A busie eare these doubtfull speeches caught: Who oft-nam'd aire some much-lou'd A wood-nymph. Dryad thought: And told to Procris, with a leuder tongue, His false surmises; with the song I sung.

Transported with imaginary blame, What is not, feares: an vnsubstantiall name. Yet grieues (poore soule!) as if in truth abus'd: Yet often doubts; and her distrust accus'd. Now holds the information for a lye: Nor will trust other witnesse then her eye. Aurora re-inthron'd th' insuing Day: I hunt, and speede. As on the grasse I lay, Come Aire, sayd I, my tyred spirits cheare. At this an vnknowne sigh invades my eare. Yet I; O come, before all ioyes preferd. I then among the leaues a rustling heard, And threw my dart; supposing it some beast: But ô, 'twas Procris! wounded on the brest, She shreekt, ay me! Her voyce to well I knew: And thither, with my griefe distracted, flew. Halfe dead, all blood-imbru'd, my wife I found: Her gift (alas!) extracting from her wound. I rais'd her body, then my owne more deare: To bind her wounds my lighter garment teare; And striue to stench the blood. O pitty take, Said I, nor thus a guilty soule forsake! She, weake, and now a dying, thus replies (Her last of speech) By all our nuptiall ties; By heauen-imbowred Gods; by those belowe, To whose infernall monarchy I goe: By that, if euer I deserued well; By this ill-fated loue, for which I fell, Yet now in death most constantly retaine; O, let not Ayre our chaster bed prophane. This said; I show'd, and she perceiued how That error grew: but what avail'd it now? She sinks; her blood along her spirits tooke: Who lookes on me as long as shee could looke.

Happy she cals the lance his hand sustaines: Happy she cals his hand-sustained raignes. And had she powre, she would haue madly past Through all the hostile ranks; her selfe haue cast Amid the Cretan tents, euen from that towre; Or ope the brasse-rib'd gates to Minos powre: Or what he else could wish.

For il-presaging feares my rest confound, Least some, not knowing him, should Minos wound: For no heart is so hard, that did but knowe, And would a lance against his bosome throw. Then thus: with me, my country I intend To render vp; and giue these warres an end. What is't to intend? Each passage hath a guard; My father keepes the keyes, and sees them bard. 'Tis he deferres my ioyes; 'tis he I dread: Would I were not, or he were with the dead! Tush, we are our owne Gods. They thriue, that dare: And Fortune is a foe to slothfull pray'r.

That course attempt I dare: Held to the world, he could not hold the ayre. This said; to arts vnknowne he bends his wits, And alters nature. Quils in order knits, Beginning with the least: the longer still The short succeeds; much like a rising hill. Their rurall pipes, the shepheards, long agoe, (Fram'd of vnequall reeds) contriued so. With threds the midst, with wax he ioynes the ends: And these, as naturall wings, a little bends. Young Icarus stood by, who little thought That with his death he playd; and smiling, caught The feathers tossed by the wand'ring ayre: Now chafes the yellow waxe with busie care, And interrupts his Sire. When his last hand Had made all perfect: with new wings he fand The ayre that bare him. Then instructs his sonne: Be sure that in the middle course thou run. Dank seas will clog the wings that lowly fly: The Sun will burne them if thou soar'st too high. 'Twixt either keepe. Neither to obserue the starres on the one side or the other: Bootes and Helice, or the greater Beare, being Northerne constellations; &amp; Orion, a Southerne. Nor on Boötes gaze, Nor Helicé, nor sterne Orions rayes: But follow me. At once, he doth advise; And vnknowne feathers to his shoulders tyes. Amid his worke and words the salt teares brake From his dim eyes; with feare his fingers shake. Then kist him, neuer to be kissed more: And rais'd on lightsome feathers flies before; His feare behind: as birds through boundlesse sky From ayrie nests produce their young to fly; Exhorts to follow: taught his banefull skill; Waues his owne wings, his sonnes obseruing still. These, while some Angler, fishing with a Cane; Or Shepheard, leaning on his staffe; or Swaine; With wonder viewes: he thinkes them Gods that glide Through ayrie regions. Now on his left side Leaues Where shee was borne, and had her Temple. Iuno's Samos, Delos, Paros Invironed with cliffes of white marble. white, Lebynthos, and Calydna on the right, Flowing with hony. When the boy, much tooke With pleasure of his wings, his Guide forsooke: And ravisht with desire of heauen, aloft Ascends. The odor-yeelding wax more soft By the swift Sunnes vicinitie then grew: Which late his feathers did together glew. That thaw'd; he shakes his armes, which now were bare, And wanted where withall to gather ayre. Then falling, Helpe ô father, cries: the blew Seas stopt his breath; Mare Icarium. from whom their name they drew. His father, now no father, left alone, Cry'd Icarus! where art thou? which way flowne? What region, Icarus, doth thee containe. Then spies the feathers floating on the Maine. He curst his arts; interres the corpse, Icaria: an Iland in the Ægæan Sea. that gaue The land a name, which gaue his sonne a graue. Perdix.The Partridge from a thicket him suruay'd; As in a tombe his wretched sonne he laid; Who clapt his fanning wings, and lowdly churd T' expresse his ioy: as then an only bird. So made of late (vnknowne in former time) O Dædalus, by thy eternall crime. To thee thy Sister gaue him to be taught; Who little of his destinie fore-thought: The boy then twelue yeares aged; of a minde Apt for instruction, and to Arts inclind. He Sawes invented, by the bones that grow In fishes backs; the steele indenting so. And two shankt Compasses with rivet bound; Th'one to stand still, the other turning round In equall distance. Dædalus this stung: Who from Which stood in Athens. Minerua's sacred turret flung The envi'd head-long; and his falling faines. Him Pallas, fautor of good wits, sustaines: Who straight the figure of a foule assumes; Clad in the midst of ayre with freckled plumes The vigor of his late swift wit now came Into his feet, and wings: he keepes his name. They never mount aloft, nor trust their birth To tops of trees; but fleck as lowe as earth, And lay their egges in tufts. In minde they beare Their ancient fall, and lofty places feare. Tyr'd Dædalus now in Sicilia lights: In whose defence Against Minos, who pursued him. hospitious Coc'lus fights. Now Athens by Theseus.

His eyes blaze blood and fire: his stiffe neck beares Horrible bristles, like a groue of speares. A boyling fome vpon his shoulders flowes From grinding jawes: his tushes equall those Of Indian Elephants: his fell mouth casts Swift lightning; and his breath the pastures blasts. Now tramples downe the corne, when in the blade; The husbandmans ripe vowes now frustrat made, And reaps the waighty eares. Their vsuall graine The Barnes and threshing floores expect in vaine. Broad-spreding vines he with their burden, sheares: And boughs from euer-leauy oliues teares. Then falls on beasts: the Herdsmen, now vnfeard; Nor Dogs, nor raging Bulls, defend their Heard.

Schœnus race: Of high Lycæan woods the onely grace. A polisht Zone her vpper garment bound; And in one knot her artlesse haire was wound: Her arrowes ivory guardian clattering hung On her left shoulder; and a bow well strung Her left hand held. Her lookes a wench display'd In a boyes face, a boyes face in a maid. The Meleager. Calydonian Heros her beheld And wisht at once: his wishes fate repeld. Who lurking flames attracts; and said, O blest Is he, whom thou shalt with thy joyes invest! But time, and modesty his courtship stay By a more pressing action call'd away A wood o're-growne with trees, yet neuer feld, Mounts from a plaine, that all beneath beheld. The glory-thirsting Gallants this ascend. Forth-with a part their corded toyles extend; Some hounds vncouple; some the tract of feet Together trace: and danger long to meet. A Dale there was, through which the raine-rais'd flood Oft tumbled downe, and in the bottom stood: Repleat with plyant willowes, marish weeds, Sharpe rushes, osiers, and long slender reeds. The Bore from thence dislodg'd, like lightning crusht Through iustling clouds, among the hunters rusht: Beares downe the obvious trees; the crashing woods Report their fall. The youths each others bloods With high-rais'd shoots inflame: who keepe their stands: And shake their broad-tipt speares with threatning hands. The dogs he scatters; those that durst oppose His horrid furie, wounds with ganching blowes. Echion first his iauelin vainely cast, Which struck a beech. The next his sides had past, But that with too much strength it ouer-flew: The weapon Pagasæan Iason threw. O Phæbus, said Mopsus, the son of Ampytus. Ampycides, if I Haue honour'd, and doe honour thee, apply Thy succour in successe of my intents. The God, as much as lay in him, assents: But from the dart the head Diana took; Which gaue no wound, although the Bore it strooke: The beast like lightning burns, thus chaft with ire: His grim eyes shine, his breast breathes flames of fire. And as a stone which some huge engine throwes Against a wall, or bulwarke man'd with foes: The deadly Bore with such sure violence Assaults their forces. The right wings defence; Eupalamon, and Pelagonus, cast On sounding earth: drawne off with timely hast. Enæsimus, great Hippocoons son, Could not so well his slaughtring tushes shun: Which cut the shrinking sinewes in his thigh, Euen as he trembled, and prepar'd to flye. And Nestor long had perished, perchance, Before Troyes warre; but, vauting on a lance, He tooke a tree, which there his branches spred: And safely saw the foe from whom he had fled. Who, full of rage, his vengefull tushes whers Vpon an Oke and dire destruction threats: When, trusting to his new edg'd armes, the Bore The manly thigh of great Orithyus tore. The Castor and Pollux; After translated into the signe of Gemini. Brother Twins, not yet cœlestiall starres; Conspicuous both, both terrible in warres; Both mounted on white steeds; a loft both bare Their glittering speares, which trembled in the aire: And both had sped; but that the swine with-drew Where neither horse nor iauelin could pursue. In followes Telamon, hot of the chace; And stumbling at a roote, fell on his face. While Peleus lifts him vp, a winged flight Atalanta, of Tegæa a citty of Arcadia, where she was borne Tegæa drew, which flew as swift as sight: Below his eare the fixed arrow stood, And stain'd his bristles with a little blood. The Virgin lesse reioyced in the blow Then Meleager: who first saw it flow, First show'd his mates the blood: O most renoun'd Said he, thy honour hath thy vertue crown'd. The men, they blush for shame; each other cheare; And high-rais'd soules, with clamors higher reare: Their speares in clusters fling; which make no breach Through idle store: and throwes their throwes impeach. Behold, Ancæus with a polax, sterne To his owne fate; who said, By me ô learne You youths, how much a mans sharpe steele exceeds A womans weapons, and applaud my deeds. Though Dian should take armes, and in this strife Protect her beast, she should not saue his life. Thus gloriously he boasts; in both his hands Advanc't his polax, and on tip-toes stands. Whom, ere his armes descend, the furious Swine Prevents; and sheathes his tushes in his groyne. Downe fell Ancæus, out his bowels gusht, All gore; with blood the earth, as guilty, blusht. Ixions son Pirithous forward prest: And with an able arme his lance addrest. To whom Theseus, the son of Ægæus. Ægides; O to me more deare Then my owne life! my better halfe; forbeare. The wife in valour should aloft contend: Foole-hardy courage was Ancæus end. This said, His dart made of that wood. his heauy cornell, with a head Of brasse, he hurles: which sure had struck him dead (It was deliuered with so true an aime) But that a tall Beech interpos'd the same. Iason, the son of Æson. Æsonides then threw his thrilling lance; Which hit (diverted from the mark by chance) A dog betweene his baying iawes: the wound Rusht through his guts, and naild him to the ground. Meleager, the son of Oeneus. Oenides varying hand discharg'd two speares: The earth the one, the beast the other beares. While now he raues, grunts, turnes his body round, Casts blood and fome; the author of his wound Rusht in; prouokes his greater wrath; and where His shields dissever, thrusts his deadly speare. They all with chearfull shouts their ioyes vnfold; Shake his victorious hands; the Beast behold With wonder, whose huge bulke possest so much: And hardly thinke it safe the slaine to touch: Yet dye their iavelins in his blood. He lay'd His foot vpon his horrid head; and said: My right receiue beloued Atlanta, of Nonacris, a mo?taine of Arcadia. Nonacrine, And let my glory ever share with thine. Then gaue the bristled spoyle, and gastly head With monstrous tushes arm'd, which terror bred. She in the Gift and giuer pleasure tooke. All murmur, with preposterous envy strooke. On whom the violent Toxeus and Plexippus. Meleagers vnckles by the mother, the sons of Thestius. Thestiadæ frowne; And cry aloud with stretcht-out armes; Lay downe: Nor, Woman, of our titles vs bereaue, Least thee thy beauties confidence deceiue; He no fit iudge, whom loue hath reft of sight: And snatcht from her, her gift; from him, his right. Meleager, the sonne of Oeneus. Oenides swels; his lookes with anger sterne: You rauishers of others honours, learne (Said he) the distance betweene words and deeds: With impious steele secure Plexippus bleeds. While Toxeus, whether to revenge his blood, Or shun his brothers fortune, wavering stood; He cleares the doubt: the weapon, hot before By th'others wound, new heats in his hearts gore. Gifts to the holy Gods Althæa brings Meleager. For her sons victorie; and Hymnes in praise of Apollo anciently sung vpon the obtaining of victory. Pæans sings. When back she saw her slaughtered brothers brought: At that sad obiect screecht; and griefe-distraught, The Citie fils with out-cryes: off she teares Her royall robes, and funerall garments weares. But told by whom they fell; no longer mournes: Rage dries her eyes; her teares to vengeance turnes.

This in an inward closset closely layes: And by preseruing it, preserues his dayes. Which now produc't; a pyle of wood she rais'd, That by the hostile fire inuaded, blaz'd. Foure times she proffers to the greedy flame The fatall brand: as oft with-drew the same. A Mother, and a sister, now contend: And two-contending names, one bosom rend. Oft feare of future crimes a palenesse bred: Oft burning Furie gaue her eyes his red. Now seemes to threaten with a cruell looke: And now appeares like one that pittie tooke. Her teares the fervor of her anger dryes: Yet found she teares againe to drowne her eyes. Euen as a ship, when wind and tyde contends, Feeles both their furies, and with either bends: So Althæa, the daughter of Thestius. Thestias, whom vnsteddie passion driues; By changes, calmes her rage, and rage reviues.

With eyes turn'd back, her quaking hand To trembling flames expos'd the funerall brand. The brand appeares to sigh, or sighes expires: Wrapt in th'imbracements of vnwilling fires.

Hippodamas his daughter could not brooke: But cast her from a rock into the deepe. Whom, while my louing streames from sinking keepe; I said: O Neptune, thou that do'st command The wandring waues that beat vpon the land; To whom wee Riuers run, in whom we end; Incline a gentle eare. I did offend Whom I support: ô kind and equall proue! Had but Hippodomas a fathers loue, Or had he not beene so inhumane; he Would both haue pittied her, and pardon'd me. Her whom his furie hath from earth exil'd, When in the troubled waues he cast his child; A place afford: or let her be a place Which I may ever with my streames imbrace.

I layd my hand vpon her panting brest: While thus I handled her, I might perceiue The earth about her stifning Body cleaue. Now, with a masse infolded, as she swims, An Iland rose from her transformed lims. He held his peace. This admiration won In all: derided by Perithous. Ixions son: By nature rough, and one who did despise All-able Gods: who said; Thou tel'st vs lyes, And think'st the Gods too potent: as if they Could giue new shapes, or take our old away. His saying all amaz'd, and none approu'd: Most Lelex, ripe in age and wisdome, mou'd. Heauens powre, immense and endlesse, none can shun; Philemon and Bavcis. Said he: and what the Gods would doe is done, To check your doubt; on Phrygian hills there growes An Oke by a Line-tree, which old walls inclose. My selfe this saw, while I in Phrygia staid; By His father. Pittheus sent: Who this should be is vnknowne vnlesse Tantalus, Pelops, was the father of Pittheus. where erst his father swaid. Hard by, a lake, once habitable ground; Where Cootes and fishing Cormorants abound. Ioue, in a humane shape; with Mercurie; (His heeles vnwing'd) that way their steps apply. Who guest-rites at a thousand houses craue; A thousand shut their doores: One only gaue. A small thatch't Cottage: where, a pious wife Old Baucis, and Philemon, led their life. Both equall-ag'd. In this, their youth they spent; In this, grew old: rich only in content. Who pouertie, by bearing it, declind: And made it easie with a chearfull mind. None Master, nor none seruant, could you call: They who command, obay; for two were all. Ioue hither came, with his Mercury, of Cyllenus a mo?taine of Arcadia, where hee was borne. Cyllenian mate; And stooping, enters at the humble gate. Sit downe, and take your ease, Philemon said. While busie Baucis straw-stuft cushions layd: Who stird abroad the glowing coles, that lay In smothering ashes; rak't vp yester-day. Dry bark, and withered leaues, thereon she throwes: Whose feeble breath to flame the cinders blowes. Then slender clefts, and broken branches gets: And ouer all a little kettle sets. Her husband with the cole-flowrs, cutts their leaues; Which from his gratefull garden he receiues: Tooke downe a flitch of bacon with a prung, That long had in the smokie chimney hung: Whereof a little quantity he cuts: And it into the boyling liquor puts. This seething; they the time beguile with speech: Vnsensible of stay. A bowle of beech, There, by the handle hung vpon a pin: This fills he with warme water; and therein Washes their feete. A mosse-stuft bed and pillow Lay on a homely bed-steede made of willow: A couerlet, vs'd but at feasts, they spred: Though course, and old; yet fit for such a bed. Downe lye the Gods. The palsie shaken Dame Sets forth a table with three legs; one lame, And shorter then the rest, a pot-share reares: This, now made levell, with greene mint she cleares, Whereon they party-colour'd oliues set, Autumnall A red fruite with a hard shell growing on a thick shrub, for the most part in mountanous places. Cornels, in tart pickle wet; Coole endiffe, radish, new egs rosted reare, And late-prest cheese; which earthen dishes beare. A goblet, of the selfesame siluer wrought; And bowles of beech, with waxe well varnisht, brought. Hot victualls from the fire were forthwith sent: Then wine, not yet of perfect age, present. This ta'ne away; the second course now comes: Philberts, dry figs, with rugged dates, ripe plummes, Sweet-smelling apples, disht in osier twines; And purple grapes new gather'd from their vines: I'th'midst, a hony combe. Aboue all these; A chearfull looke, and ready will to please. Meane-while, the maple cup it selfe doth fill: And oft exhausted, is replenisht still. Astonisht at the miracle; with feare Philemon, and the aged Baucis, reare Their trembling hands in pray'r: and pardon craue, For that poore entertainement which they gaue. One Goose they had, Being wakefull and crying out at euery noise. their cottages chiefe guard; Which they to hospitable Gods award: Who long their slowe pursuit deluding, flies To Iupiter, so sau'd from sacrifice. W'are Gods, said they; Revenge shall all destroy: You in this ruine shall your liues inioy. Together leaue your house; and to yon'hill Follow our steps. They both obey their will; The Gods conducting: feebly both ascend; Their staues, with theirs; they, with times burden bend. A flight-shot from the top, review they take; And see all swallowed by a mighty lake: Their house excepted. While they this admire, Lament their neighbours ruine, and desire To see their cottage, which doth onely keepe Its place; while for the places fate they weepe; That humble shed, too little euen for two, Became a Fane. To colums crotches grew; The thatch and roofe shine with bright gold; the doores Divinely caru'd; the pauement marble floores. While fearefull Baucis and Philemon pray'd, Jupiter, the son of Saturnius. Saturnius with a chearefull count'nance said: Thou iust old man; and thou good woman, who Deseru'st so iust a husband: what doe you In chiefe desire? They talke a while alone; Then thus to Ioue their common wish make knowne. We craue to be your Priests, this Fane to guard. And since in all our liues we never jarr'd; Let one houre both dissolue: nor let me be Intomb'd by her, nor she intomb'd by me. Their sute is sign'd. The Temple they possest, As long as life. With time and age opprest; As now they stood before the sacred gate, And call to memory that places fate; Philemon saw old Baucis freshly sprout: And Baucis saw Philemon leaues thrust out. Now on their heads aspiring branches grew. While they could speake, they spake: at once, adieu They iointly said: at once the creeping rine Their trunks inclos'd; at once their shapes resigne. They of A citty of Phrygia. Tyana to this present show These neighbour trees, that from two bodies grow. Old men, nor like to lye, nor vaine of tongue, This told. I saw their boughs with garlands hung: And hanging fresher, said; Who Gods before Receiu'd, be such: adorers, we adore. The tale, and teller; wonder, and beliefe, Provok't in all: but Theseus moues in chiefe. Who couetous to heare such deeds as these: The Achelous. Calydonian River, prest to please, In this sort, leaning on his elbow, spake. There be, who euer keep the forme they take: Others haue powre themselues, at will, to change; Protevs. As thou blew Protëus, that in seas do'st range. Who now a Man, a Lyon now appeares; Now, a fell Bore: a Serpents shape now beares. A Bull, with threatning hornes, now seem'st to be: Now, like a Stone; now, like a spreading Tree. And sometimes like a gentle Riuer flowes: Sometimes like Fire, averse to Water, showes. Metra: on whom he begat Anticlea, the mother of Vasses. Autolicus his wife, the daughter to Leud Erisichthon, things as strange could doe. Erisichthon.He was her father, who the Gods despis'd: Nor ever on their Altars sacrifis'd. Who Ceres groues with steele profan'd: where stood An old huge Oke; euen of it selfe a wood. Wreathes, ribands, See the Comment. gratefull tables, deckt his boughs And sacred stem; the Dues of powerfull Vowes. Full oft the Nymphs of the Woods. Dryades, with Chaplets crownd, Danc't in his shade; full oft they tript a Round About his bole. Fiue cubits three times told His ample circuit hardly could infold. Whose stature other trees as farre exceeds; As other trees surmount the humble weeds. Yet this his fury rather did provoke: Who bids his seruants fell the sacred Oke. And snatches, while they paus'd, an axe from one: Thus storming: Not the Goddesse-lou'd alone: But though this were the Ceres. Goddesse, she should downe: And sweepe the earth with her aspiring crowne. As he advanc't his armes to strike; the Oke Both sigh'd and trembled at the threatning stroke. His leaues and acornes, pale together grew: And colour-changing branches sweat cold deaw. Then wounded by his impious hand, the blood Gusht from th' incision in a purple flood. Much like a mighty Oxe, that falls before The sacred altar; spouting streames of gore. On all amazement seaz'd: when One of all The crime deterres; nor would his axe let fall. Contracting his sterne browes; Receaue, said he, Thy pieties reward; and from the tree The stroke converting, lops his head; then strake The Oke againe: from whence a voice thus spake; A Dryad so called of Okes; wherewith they were said to florish and perish.A Nymph am I, within this tree inshrin'd, Belou'd of Ceres. O prophane of mind, Vengeance is neere thee. With my parting breath I prophesie: a comfort to my death. He still his guilt pursues: who overthrowes With cabels, and innumerable blowes, The sturdy Oke: which, nodding long, downe rusht; And in his lofty fall his fellowes crusht. Their sister, and their groue, the Nymphs lament; Who, hid in sable vales, to Ceres went; On Erisichthon iust revenge require: Who readily consents to their desire. The faire-brow'd Goddesse shakes her shining haires: With that, the fields shooke all their golden eares. Who to a mercilesse revenge proceeds (Had he deserued mercy by his deeds) By staruing. But, since not by fatall doome, Ceres and Famine might together come: A Nymph, one of the light So called in that day frequent the Mountaines. Oreades, Dispatcheth thither, with such words as these. In frosty Scythia lies a land, forlorne And barren; bearing neither fruit nor corne. Numb Cold, pale Hew, chill Ague, there abide; And meager Famine. Bid that Fury glide Into his cursed entrailes, and devoure All plenty: let her rage subdue my powre. But least long waies thy iourney tedious make: My charriot and my yoked dragons take. Taking her charriot; through the empty skies To Scythia and rough Caucasus she flies. There, in a stony field, sad Famine found; Tearing with teeth and nailes the foodlesse ground: With snarled haire, sunk eyes, lookes pale and dead, Lips white with slime, thin teeth with rust ore-spred; Through her hard skin the writhel'd guts appeare; Her huckle-bones stuck vp, a valley where Her belly should ascend; her dry breasts hung So lanke as if they to her back had clung: By falling flesh the rising ioints augment; Round knees and ankles leanely eminent. Espi'd far off (she durst not be so bold To come too neere) the Nymph her message told. After a little stay, although she were Farre off, although but now arriued there; She famine felt. Who wheeles about her Snakes; And her high passage to Thessaly, Erisichthon country. Æmonia takes. Famine obayes the Goddesses command; Though their endeauours still opposed stand. Who, by a tempest hurried through the skyes, Enters the wretches roofe: besides him lyes, Then fast a sleepe: (for now Nights heauy charmes All eyes had clos'd) imbrac't him in her armes; Her selfe infus'd; breathes on his face and breast: And emptie veines with hungers rage possest. This thus perform'd, forsakes the fruitfull earth: And back returnes to her abodes of dearth. Sound Sleepe as yet with pleasurable wings On Erisichthon gentle slumber flings. Who dreames of feasts, extends his idle jawes; With labouring teeth fantastically chawes. Deludes his throat by swallowing emptie fare: And for affected food devoures the ayre. Awak't; hot famine raues through all his veines: And in his guts, and greedy pallat raignes. Forth-with; what Sea, what Earth, what Ayre affords, Acquires: complaines of staruing at full bords. In banquets, banquets seekes. What might alone Haue Townes and Nations fed; suffice not one. Hunger increaseth with increast repast. And as all rivers to the Ocean hast; Who thirsty still, drinks vp the stranger floods: As rauenous fires refuse no profferd foods; Huge pyles receiue; the more they haue, the more By much desire; made hungry with their store. So Erisichthon, of a mind prophane, Full dishes empties, and demands againe. Meat breeds in him an appetite to meat; Who ever emptie, still prepares to eat. His bellies gulfe his patrimonie wasts: Consuming famine yet vnlesned lasts; And his insatiable throtes extent. Metra.Now all his wealth, into his bowels sent: A daughter left, vnworthy such a Sire, The beggar sold to feed his hungers fire. Her noble thoughts base servitude disdaine: Who now her hands extending to the Maine; O thou that hadst my mayden-head, said she, Thy rauisht spoyle from hated bondage free! Neptune had this: who to her prayer consents. And, though then by her master seene, prevents His following search: transforming of his Rape Into a man; maskt in a fishers shape. Angler, her master said, that with thy bait Conceal'st thy hooke; so prosper thy deceit, So rest the sea compos'd; so may the fish Be credulous, and taken at thy wish; As thou reveal'st her, who in garments poore, And rufled haire, late stood vpon this shore. For here, but very now, I saw her stand: Nor farther trace her foot-steps in the sand. She, Neptunes bountie finding; well apaid To be inquir'd for of her selfe; thus said. Pardon me Sir, who e're you are; my eyes Haue beene attentive on this exercise. To win beliefe; so may the God of Seas Assist my cunning in such arts as these: As late nor man nor maid I saw before Your selfe, my selfe excepted, on this shore. He credits, and beguil'd, the shore forsook: When she againe her former figure took. Her father, seeing she could change her shape, Oft sold her; who as often made escape. Now hart-like, now a cow, a bird, a mare: And fed with hunger with ill-purchast fare. But when his maladie all meanes had spent; And he had giuen it the last nourishment; Now to devoure his proper flesh proceeds, And by diminishing, his body feeds. What need I dwell on forraine facts? even we Can vary shapes, though limited they be. Now seeme I as I am; oft like a Snake: And many times a Bulls horn'd figure take. But while I hornes assum'd, one thus was broke, As you behold. This, with a sigh, he spoke. The Ninth Booke. The Argvment. A Serpent Achelous: now a Bull: His seuered Horne with plenty ever full. Lichas a Rock. Alcides sunke in flame, Ascends a God. The labour-helping Dame A Weesel. Lotis, flying lust, becomes A tree: the like sad Dryope intombs. Old Iolaus waxeth young agen. Callirrho'es Infants sodenly grow Men Byblis a weeping Fountaine. Iphis, now A Boy, to Isis paies his maiden Vow. Hee, Theseus the son of Ægeus the son of Neptune. who his high descent from Neptune drawes, Of his so sad a sigh demands the cause, And maimed brow. When thus The riuer Achelous. the God proceeds: His dangling curles impal'd with quiuering reeds. A heauie taske you impose: his owne disgrace Achelovs And Hercvles. Who would reviue? Yet was it not so base To be subdude, as noble to contend: And such a Victor doth my foyle defend. Haue you not heard of faire-cheekt Deianire? The envi'd hope of many: the desire Of all that knew her. Wee, with others, went To Oeneus Court, to purchace his consent. Oeneus. Parthaons son, make me thy sonne in law; I, and Hercules. Alcides said: the rest with-draw. He, with his father Ioue, his Labours fame, And Iuno's. Step-dames vanquisht tasks, inforc't his clame. 'Twere shame, said I, that deathlesse Gods, to men Who dye, should stoope. (A God he was not then). These euer-liuing waters I command, That wind in endlesse currents through thy land. Thy Son no stranger is, if I be He: But of thy country and a friend to thee. And be't no preiudice; that Iuno's hate, Nor punishing imployments presse my fate. If from Alemena you your being drew: Ioue's your false father, or the crime is true. You seeke a Father in a mothers shame, Or be not Ioue's, or take a bastards name. He, all this while, with eyes that sparkle fire, Vpon me frownd: and weakly rules his ire. Then onely said; My hand my tongue exceeds: Winne thou with words, so I subdue with deeds. With that, fell on. To speake so big, and shrink, I shame: and let my A colour attributed to Rivers, in regard of the greene banks and ouer-shadowing trees, reflected by the water. waue-greene Mantle sink; My armes oppose, my hands for seasure prest; And euery fitted part for fight addrest. He throwes To take the better hold. dust on me with his hollow hand: And I againe besprinkle him with sand. Now catches at my neck, now at my thighes; Or proffer makes: and euery lim applies. But me my waight defends; in vaine he striues. Much like as when a roring billow driues Against a rock: the rock repels his pride; By his owne poisure firmely fortifi'd. Both for a while with-drew: againe we meete, And strongly keepe our stands; feete ioyne to feete. With that I rusht vpon him with my brest. My fingers, his; my brow his fore-head prest. So haue I seene two Buls with horrid might Together close; the motiue of their fight The fairest Cow in all those feilds: the Heard With feare expecting which should bee preferr'd. Thrice Hercules did all his force incline (As oft in vaine) to free his brest from mine. The fourth assay my strong imbrace vnbound: And from my grasping armes his body wound. Then turning me about (truth guides my tongue) Vpon my back with all his burden hung. If I haue faith (this ly can find no way To praise) on me, me thought a mountaine lay. Scarce could I clasp my armes, all frotht with sweat: Scarce from his gripes could I my body get Still pressing on, he giues nor time to breathe Nor gather strength: my powers my trust deceaue. At last, his yoking armes my neck command: When, puld vpon my knees, I bit the sand. My natiue slight my weaker force supply'd: I from him like a lengthfull Serpent glide. Now in contracted folds I forward sprung: Horridly hissing with my forked tongue. He laughs; and flouts my cunning in this sort: To strangle Serpents Two sent by Iuno to destroy him in his cradle. was my cradles sport. Though other dragons to thy conquest bow: To dire See the Comment. Lernean Hydra what art thou? Her wounds were fruitfull: from each seuer'd head; Each of her hundred necks two fiercer bred: More strong by twining heires. These thus renu'd And multiply'd by death, I twice subdu'd. What hope hast thou, a forged Snake, to scape? That fight'st with others armes; and begst thy shape. This said; my neck his grasping fingers clincht; And scruz'd my throate; as if with pincers wrincht: While from his gripes I stroue my iawes to pull. Twice ouer-come; now, like a furious Bull, Once more his terrible assaults oppose. His armes about my swelling chest he throwes, And following, hales: my horne (my head turn'd round) Fixt on the earth; and threw me on the ground. My brow (that not sufficing) disadornes: By breaking one of my ingaged hornes. The Water Nymphs. Naiades with fruits and flowres this fill: Copia Cornis.Wherein abundant plenty riots still. Here Achelöus ends. One louely-faire, Girt like Diana's Nymph, with flowing haire, Came in; and brought the wealthy Horne; repleat With Autumnes store, and fruit seru'd after meat. Day sprung; and mountaine shone with early beames. His Guests depart: nor stay till peacefull streames Glyde gently downe, and keepe their bounded race. Sad Achelous now his rustick face And maymed head within the current shrowds. This blemish much his former beautie clouds: All else compleat. The dammage of his browes He shades with flaggie wreathes, and sallow boughes. But Deianira, Nessus, was thy wrack: Nessvs. A deadly arrow piercing through thy back. Hercules. Ioues son, with his new wife; to Thebes his course Directing; came t'Euenus rapid sourse. The big-swolne Streames increast with winters raine, And whurling round, their passage now restraine. For her he feares: feare for himselfe abhor'd. When strong-lim'd Nessus came, who knew the Ford; And said; I safely will transport thy Bride: Meane-while swim thou vnto the other side. To him Hercules, so called of his strength. Alcides his pale wife betakes: Who, fearing both the flood, and Nessus, quakes. Charg'd with his quiuer, and his Lyons skin (His club and bow before throwne ouer) in The Heros leapes, and said; How'euer vast, These waues, since vndertaken, shall be past. And confident, nor seekes the smoothest wayes: Nor by declining entertaines delayes. Now ouer; stooping for his bow, he heard His wiues shrill shreekes; and Nessus saw, prepard To violate his trust. Thou ravisher, What hope said he, can thy vaine speed confer? Holla, A Centaure. thou halfe a beast; with-hold thy flight: I wish thee heare; nor intercept my right: If no respect of me can fix thy trust: Yet, let thy Ixion, fained to be turned in Hell on a restles wheele, for attempting Iuno: who deceaued him with a cloud in her likenesse; on whom shee begot the Centaures. Fathers wheele restraine thy lust. Nor shalt thou scape revenge; how ever fleete, Wounds shall or'e-take thy speed, though not my feete. The last, his deeds confirme; for as he fled, An arrow struck his back: the barbed head Past through his brest. Tug'd out, a crimson flood Spouts both waies; mixt with With which Hercules arrowes were infected. Hydras poys'nous blood. This Nessus tooke; and softly said: yet I, Hercules. Alcides, will not vnrevenged dy. And gaue Dianira. his Rape a robe, dipt in that gore: This will (said he) the heat of loue restore. Hercvles.Long after (all the ample world possest With his great acts, and Iunos hate increast) From raz'd A Citty of Euboa, which he sackt with the slaughter of Euritus &amp; his sonnes, for denying him his daughter Jole, whom he bore away with him. Oechalia hasting his remoue, To sacrifice vnto So called of a Promontory in Euboa, where he had his altar. Cenæan Ioue: Fames bablings Deianira's eares surprise (Who falsehood adds to truth, and growes by lies) How Iole, Hercules, begotten by Ioue in the shape of Amphitrio Alcmenas husband. Amphitryoniades With loue inthraul'd. Stung with this strong disease The troubled louer credits what she feares. At first she nourisheth her griefe with teares: Which weeping eyes diffuse. Then said; But why Weepe we? the Strumpet in these teares will ioy. Since she will come, some change attempt I must; Before my bed be stained with her lust. Shall I complaine? be mute? shift houses? stay? Returne to Calydon, and giue her way? Or call to mind that I am sister to Great Meleager, and some mischiefe doe? What iniur'd woman; what the spleenefull woe Of iealousie; by harlots death, can show? Her thoughts, long toyld with change, now fixed stood To send the garment dipt in Nessus blood; To quicken fainting loue. The Present she To Lycas gaue (as ignorant as he) And her owne sorrow. Who with good intent And kind respects, the robe t'her husband sent. Which now the vnsuspecting Heroe wore: Wrapt in the poyson of Hydras: whose mother was Echidna. Echidna's gore. Who praying, new-borne flames with incense fed: And bowles of wine on marble altars shed. The spreading mischiefe works: with heat dissolu'd, The manly limmes of Hercules involu'd. Who, whilst he could, with vsuall fortitude His grones supprest. All patience now subdu'd With such extreames; the altar downe he flings: And shady A mountaine of Thessaly, famous by the death, the funerall pyle, and Sepulcher of Hercules But how could hee, who even now sacrificed in Euboa be so sodenly transported to the Continent! Diodorus writes, that after the poyson began to worke, he, dismissing his army, came to Trachin. His torment increasing, he sent Iolaus to Delphos to consult with Apollo about his recovery; and in the meane time ascended the mountaine where he caused himselfe to be burnt aliue. Oeta with his clamor rings. Forth-with, to teare the torture off, he striues. The riven robe, his skin that lines it, riues; Or to his limmes vnseparably cleaues; Or his huge bones and sinewes naked leaues. As fire-red steele in water drencht; so toyles His hissing blood, and with hot poyson boyles. No meane! the greedy flames his entralls eat; And all his body flowes with purple sweat: His scorched sinewes crack, his marrow fries. Then, to the starres his hands advancing, cries. Feast, Iuno, on our harmes. O, from on high Behold this plague! thy cruell stomack cloy. If foes may pitty purchase (such are we;) This life, with torments vext; long sought by thee; And borne to toyle, receiue. For death would proue To me a blessing: and a Step-dames loue May such a blessing giue. Of these his seuerall exploits see the comment. Haue I this gain'd, For slaine Busiris; who Ioues temple stain'd With strangers blood? That from the earth earth-bred Antæus held? Whom Geryons triple head Nor thine, ô Cerberus, could once dismay? These hands, these made the Cretan Bull obay Your labours, Elis; smooth Stymphalian floods, Confesse with praises; and Parthenian woods. You got the golden belt of Thermodon: And apples from the sleeplesse Dragon won. Nor cloud-borne Centaures, nor th'Arcadian Bore, Could me resist: nor Hydra with her store Of frightfull heads; which by their losse increast. I, when I saw the Thracian Horses feast With humane flesh, their mangers ouer-threw: And with his steeds, their wicked Master flew. These hands the Nemean Lyon chokt: these queld Huge Cacus, and these shoulders heauen vp-held: Ioues cruell wife grew weary to impose: I never to performe. But ô, these woes, This new found plague, no vertue can repell; Nor armes, nor weapons! Hungry flames of hell Shoote through my veines; and on my liuer prey. Who had vniustly imposed his so many labours. Eurystheus yet tryumphs: and some will say That there be Gods! Here his complaints he ends; And high-raisd steps or'e lofty Oeta bends, Hurried with anguish: like a Bull, that beares A wounding iauelin; whom the wounder feares. Oft should you see him quake, oft grone, oft striuing To teare his garments; solid trees vp-riuing, Inraged with the mountaines, and then reares His scorched armes vnto his fathers spheares. Hid in a hollow rock, he Lycas spies: When torture had possest his faculties Lycas. With all her furies. Lycas didst thou giue This horrid gift, said he? Think'st thou to liue; I dying by thy treason? While he quakes, Lookes gastly pale, vnheard excuses makes; While yet he spake, while to his knees he clung; Caught by the heeles, about his head thrice swong, Some say hee threw him from the Centan Promontory, before he came vnto Oeta.Him into deepe Eubæan surges threw; (As engines stones) who hardned as he flew. As falling shoures congeal'd with frezing winds Conuert to snow; as snow together binds, And rouling round in solid haile descends: So while the aire his forced body rends, Bloodlesse with terror, all his moisture gone; That Age reports him chang'd to rugged stone: And still within Eubœas gulphy deepes: A smale rocke lies, which mans proportion keepes: Whereon the mariners forbeare to fall, As if 't had sence. And this they Lycas call. But thou, Hercules. Ioues God-like son (a Pyle with store Of trees aduanc't, which lofty Oeta bore) Thy Bow and ample Quiuer For without the arrowes of Hercules Troy could not be taken: brought thither before when Hercules sackt that citty in the daies of Laomedon. (wherein ly Those arrowes, that againe must visit Troy) Bequeath'st to Philoctetes. Peans Heire: who catching fire Puts to the Pyle. While greedy flames aspire; Thou on the top thy Lyons spoyle didst spread: And layst thereon (thy club beneath thy head) With such a looke; as if a crowned Guest Amidst full goblets, at a mirthfull feast. Now all imbracing flames a crackling made: And their Contemners patient limmes invade. The Gods much thought for Earths Defender tooke: When thus Iupiter the son of Saturne. Saturnius, with a cheerefull looke: This griefe, you Gods, is our delight: with all Our soule we ioy, that such a people call Vs King and Father; who so gratefull are, And of our progeny expresse such care: For though his noble acts deserue as much; You vs oblige. But least vaine terrors touch Your loyall hearts; let not these flames displease: Who conquered all, shall also conquer these. The God of fire, here taken for fire it selfe. Vulcan shall but his mothers part subdue: For that's immortall which from vs he drew; And can nor taste of death, nor stoope to fire: Which, freed from earth, shall to our ioyes aspire. This all your Deities I thinke will please. If any grudge such grace to Hercules, Nor would his honour; let them enuy still: They shall confirme our act against their will. The Gods ascent. And Iuno's selfe accords; At least in show: yet Iupiters last words Vnsmooth her forehead with obseru'd distaste. What flame could vanquish, Vulcan, or fire. Mulciber doth waste. And Hercules, not knowne by face, remaines; Who nothing of his mothers forme retaines: Now only Ioue-like. As a snake his yeares Casts with his skin, and sprightly young appeares With glittering scales: so, the Hercules, of Tirynthia, a citty of Peloponesus, where he was fostered. Tiryntian, Hauing put off the habit of fraile man, Shines in his better part, and seemes more great: With awe-infusing maiesty repleat. Rapt in a charriot by almighty Ioue, Through hollow clouds, vnto the starres aboue. Supposed to support the Heauens.Prest Atlas feeles his waight. Eurystheus ire Ends not in death: his hatred to the Sire Pursues his race. Alcmena, worne with care; Alcmena. Had The daughter of [illeg.]itus, brought by Hercules from Euboa. Iole to whom she might declare Herold-wiues plaints, her Sons hard labours (knowne Through broad-spred Earth) his fortunes, and her owne. Her Hercules son by Deianira. Hyllas, by Alcides testament, Tooke to his bed, with loues vnforc't consent; And fild her womb with generous seede: when thus Alcmena: Be the Gods propitious, And quick in working, when thy time drawes neare To call A name of Lucina, in that assistant at the Labours of women. Ilithyia, whom sad mothers feare: To me made difficult by Iunos spight. For ten accomplisht signes did now excite My trauell to Alcides birth; whose waight My belly stretcht: which bare so great a fraight, That you might sweare it was begot by Ioue: When with intollerable paines I stroue. Now also, speaking, horror chils my heart: And griefes remembred adds to griefe a part. Seauen nights, seauen dayes, thus rackt; with anguish tir'd, My hands vpheld, with out-cries, I desir'd The Goddesse of child-birth so called in that shee brings them to light. Lucina's aid, my burden to vnty. She came indeede, but pre-corrupted by Ioues wife, to execute her deadly hate. Hearing my grones, she sate before the gate On yonder Altar: her right knee vpholds Her crosse left ham; whose fingers knit in folds Delai'd deliuery: and with mutter'd spels Of secret powre, the pressing birth repels. I striue; and rauing, task vngratefull Ioue: Desire to die; and breath complaints might moue Relentlesse flints. The Theban, of which citty Cadmus was the founder. Cadmean Dames were there; Who pray for me, and comfort my despaire. Red-hair'd Galanthis, one of meane descent; Galanthis. In all employments stoutly diligent, Beloued for her duetie; doth misdoubt Malitious Iuno. Passing in and out, She saw the Goddesse on the altar sit; Her armes about her knees her fingers knit. What ere you be, reioyce with vs, she sayd; Ioyfull Alcmena hath her belly layd. Lucina.The Goddesse, ruling child-birth, starting, rose: And parting her linckt fingers, eas'd my Throwes. They say Galanthis laught at this deceit: Whom straight the flouted Goddesse, in a fret, Drags by the haire; nor suffers her to rise: Forth-with her armes convert to leggs and thighes: Agility and colour still abide: Her shape transform'd. In that her mouth supply'd Help to that child-birth, at her mouth she beares. Nor now our still-frequented houses feares. This said, she sighes for her old seruants sake: To whome Jole, wife to Hyllus Alcmenas Grand-child. her daughter, likewise sighing, spake. Dryope.You, Mother, sorrow for no kinreds fate. But what if I the wondrous change relate Of my poore Sister? Teares, and sorrow seaze My troubled speech. Of all Virgins of Oechalia, a citty of Euboa, where her Father Euritus raigned. th'Oechalides For forme few might with Dryope compare; The onely child her dying mother bare: I borne by a second wife. Her virgin flowre Being gatherd by Apollo. that ouer-mastring powre, Who in Delos, and in Delphos doth reside; Andræmon weds her: happy in his Bride, A Lake there is, which sheluing borders bound, Much like a shore; with fragrant myrtles crownd. Hither came simple Dryope (what more Afflicts me) to those Nymphs she garlands bore. Her armes her child, a pleasing burden, hold; Who suckt her brests: not yet a twelue-month old: Hard by the lake a flowry Lotus grew, (Expecting berryes) of a crimson hew. Thence pulling flowres, she gaue them to her son To play with all; so was I like t'haue done: For I was there. I saw the blood descend From dropping twigs: the boughs with horror bend. And heard, too late; how that a Nymph, who fled From lustfull The deformed God of Propagation. Priapus; to quit her dread, Assum'd this shape: the name of Lotus kept. My Sister, this not knowing backward stept; And would depart, as soone as she had prayd: But rootes her feete, for all her strugling, stayd. Who only moues aboue. The bark increast: Ascending from the bottome to her brest. This seene; she thought t'haue torne her haire: but teares Leaues from their twigs: her head greene branches beares The child Amphisus (for his grand-father Eurytus, did that name on him confer) Now finds his mothers brests both stiffe and dry: I, a spectator of thy tragedy, Deare sister, had in me no powre of aid. Yet, as I could, thy growing trunk I stayd, Clung to thy spredding boughs; and wisht that I Intomb'd with thee, might in thy Lotus ly. Behold, Andræmon comes; with him, her Sire; (Both wretched!) and for Dryope inquire: When I for Dryope the Lotus show'd. They kisses on the yet warme wood bestow'd: And, groueling on the ground, her roots imbrace. Now all of thee, deare Sister, but thy face Th'incroaching habit of a tree receiues. With teares she bathes her new created leaues. Who, while she might, while yet away remain'd For speaking passion; in this sort complain'd. If Credit to the wretched may be giuen; I sweare by all the Powres inbowr'd in Heauen, I neuer this deseru'd. Without a sin I suffer: innocent my life hath bin. Or if I lie, may my greene branches fade: And, feld with axes, on the fire be layd.

But now in mind and body impotent, The sonne of Deione by Apollo. Deionides Miletus fear'd ascent T' his throne suspects; adorn'd with youth, and stile Of Phœbus son: nor durst his feares exile. But thou, Miletus, of thy owne accord Forsook'st thy natiue home: and now abord, Through deepe Ægæan seas to Asia came: Erecting there M[illeg.] a citty of thy name. He, as the Nymph Cyanee (excellent For beauty) daughter to Meander, went Along his winding banks, comprest her there: Who Byblis at one birth with Caunus bare. Byblis example lawlesse loue reproues: Byblis. Byblis The son of Miletus, who was the son of Apollo. Apollineian Caunus loues, Not as sister should a brother doe: Nor at the first her owne affections knew. Nor thought it sinne so eagerly to kisse: Nor by imbracing to haue done amisse. Whom shadow of false piety beguiles; Loue by degrees corrupts. Her dresse, and smiles, She frames t'attract; to seeme too faire desires: And enuies whom so euer he admires. Yet knowes not her disease: no wishes rise In sighes as yet; and yet within she fries. Now calls him Lord; the due of blood disclaim'd: Who would be Byblis, and not sister nam'd. Nor waking durst she harbor in her brest A wanton hope: but in dissoluing rest Her louer oft enioyes; her senses keepe A festiuall; yet blushes in her sleepe. Sleepe fled; long mute; her dreame againe renues By repetition: which she thus pursues. Woe's me! what bode these fantasies of night! If true, how wretched! why should such delight? His heauenly forme by envy is approu'd: Who might, if not a brother, be belou'd; And merits my affections (ô too well) If I were not his sister: there's my hell! While waking, I indeavour no such ill, May these bewitching dreames inchant me still! No Spie could blab that imitated ioy. O Venus, and with thee, Cupid. thou winged Boy! What pleasure, what content, had I that night! How lay I all dissolued in delight! With how much ioy remembred! short those ioyes; And hastie Night our happinesse envies. Would I could change this wretched name of mine! Or he the intrest in his blood resigne! How well, ô Caunus, might our father be A father in law, or to thy selfe, or me! O would to Ioue we all in common held, Except our birth! though mine his birth exceld! Who then (ô fairest!) wilt thou make a mother? How ill hath Nature linkt vs to each other! Still must thou be my brother: what I hate, I onely haue. What then prognosticate These flattering visions? What in these extreames, Can dreames auaile? or is there waight in dreames? The Gods forbid! Yet Gods their Sisters wed, Saturne and Ops had both one womb and bed. So Tethys with Oceanus; so Iove Combines with Iuno in eternall loue. Gods haue peculiar lawes: how dare I draw From them examples, bound t'another law? Die, die forbidden flames; or let me die. Then may my brother kisse me when I ly On sable herse. Besides, the ioynt consent This craues of two. Say it should me content: He may abhorre it. Yet Macarius the sonne of Æolus, who lay with his Sister Canace. Æolides Imbraced his. Whence spring such proofes as these! O whether rapt! you wicked flames, remoue: A brother, as befits a sister, loue. Yet should he first affect, perhaps I then His loue might cherish, and affect again. Then shall I, who would not his sute reiect, Sue first? What, canst thou speak? thy thoughts detect? I can: Loue prompts. If shame my speech suppresse; Yet letters may my hidden flames confesse. This pleas'd her; and a little satisfi'de Her doubtful mind. When rais'd on her let slide, And leaning on her elbow; Hap what may, We will (said she) our frantick loue display. O, whether slide I! ô what flames excite These thoughts? then fits her trembling hands to write: One holds the wax, the The yron pin, where with (as row) they anciently writ on tables couered with wax: from whence, what is elegantly indited is called a goodstyle. style the other guides. Begins, doubts, writes, and at the tables chides; Notes, razes, changes oft, dislikes, approues, Throwes all aside, resumes what she remoues; Her will she knowes not; no composure brookes: Soft shame and impudence striue in her lookes. She had writ Sister: that, as most vnfit, Defacing; tooke the tables, and thus writ. Health to her only Loue that Louer sends; Whose health alone vpon your loue depends. To tell you who I am; alas, I shame. If you would know my sute; without a name O let me plead, nor be for Byblis knowne, Vntill my hopes be to assurance growne. Pale colour, leannesse, ruthfull lookes, wet eyes, Long sighes which from concealed passion rise, Frequent imbracements, and (if you so much Obserued) kisses of too hot a touch To sute a sisters coldnesse: these exprest The deepe distemper of my wounded brest. And yet, although my soule the wound sustain'd, Although in me a firy fury raign'd; Heauens witnesse, that I might at length be well, I try'd the vtmost; striuing to repell The violent darts of Cupid: and farre more Then you would thinke a woman could, I bore Against my will, I now become your slaue: And with afflicted language pitty craue. You may preserue; you onely can vndoe: Choose which you will. Nor sues a foe to you; But who, too neere ally'd, would neerer ioyne: And in a strickter league of loue combine. Let old men know what's lawfull, good, or ill: And to their frosty rules subject their will. Rash Venus fits our yeares. Yet knowe not we Intangling lawes: let vs thinke all things free, And imitate the Gods. Paternall awe, Respect of fame, nor feare can vs with-draw: Alone all diffidencie lay aside. Our easie stealths a brothers name will hide. We may in privat talk; converse, and kisse, Who ever be. What wants to crowne our blisse? O pitty me, who haue my loue confest; Nor would, had not my vtmost ardor prest: Least thy remorselesse cruelty be read Vpon my monument, when I am dead. The wax thus fild with her successelesse wit; She verses in the vtmost margent writ. Then seales her shame: her parched tongue deny'd To wet her gemme; which weeping eyes supply'd. She, blushing, calls a seruant of knowne trust And flattering him a while; My friend, thou must See these with care, and secrecie, convaid To my (there paus'd, and after) brother, said. In their deliuery the tables fell: She, at that Omen, starts; yet bids farewell. The wary messenger attends his time: And giues to Caunus her infolded crime. Amaz'd Caunus, the son of Cyan[illeg.], daughter to Mæander. Mæandrius high in choller grew: And on the ground the halfe-read tables threw. About to strike; Thou wicked instrument Of horrid lust, said he, by flight prevent My swords revenge: but that our infamy Thy death would publish; villain, thou shouldst dy. He, frighted, flies; and to his mistresse beares The wrath of Caunus. Byblis quaking heares Her sad repulse: a death-resembling cold Beseig'd her heart, and vitall heat controld. Yet, with her soule, her frantick loue returnes: Who, with scarce moouing lips, thus softly mournes. And worthily. Why, ô too rash! haue I Disclos'd this wound? affections secrecie. Who would so soone to headdy lines commit? First, with ambiguous words it had beene fit T'haue felt his thoughts; and train'd him to pursue. I should haue noted how the weather grew; And chosen a safe Sea: but now my sailes Swell desperatly with vnexpected gales. Now borne on crushing rocks, the floods or'e-beare My sinking bark; nor can I back-ward steere. Could not that Omen check the cherisht scope Of my desires; when, with our blasted hope, The tables fell? should I not haue assign'd Another day; or wholy chang'd my mind? O no, the day. This, Heauen fore-shew'd by sad And sure presages; had not I beene mad. My selfe, before my letters, should haue su'd; And liuely loue exprest: he should haue viewd My moouing teares; a Louers pleading eyes: More could I haue spoke then letters can comprise. About his neck my armes I might haue wound; And, had he cast me off, appeare to sound; Clung to his feet, and groueling, life implore. This passion might haue acted, and much more: Whereof, though each particular had fail'd; Yet altogether ioyn'd might haue prevail'd. Perhaps the blame-deseruing messenger In choice of time, or circumstance, did erre: Nor tooke him, when his mind was pleas'd and free. This wrackt my hopes. For of no Tygresse he, Nor Lyonesse, was borne: his gentle brest Rough flint, hard steele, nor adamant invest. He must be won: no sowre repulse shall make My sute surcease, till life my brest forsake. The best, if what is done were to begin, Is not t'attempt: next, what w'attempt, to win. For never would he, though I should ore-sway My strong desires, forget this lewd assay. Desisting, would condemne my loue for light; Or that I tri'd to intrap him by this slight: Or may conceaue that brutish lust did moue These extrasies; and not the God of loue. Nor can I but haue had a wicked mind; My will polluted; which my hand hath sign'd. No giving back can make me innocent: Nought can I adde to sinne, Much to content. This said; one thought another doth controule: So great a discord wracks her wavering soule! Dislikes; yet acts: who never satisfi'd; (Accurst) attempteth, to be oft deni'd. This seene, he flies his country for her crime: In Caria; called Caunus: vnhealthfull in the Summer &amp; Autumne.And builds a Citty in a forraine clime. When wofull Byblis, raving through despaire, Her garments, from her brused bosome tare; Striking her armes through fury, and proclames In high distraction, her incestuous flames. Hopelesse, her hated mansion she eschues: And frantickly, her brothers flight pursues. And as Thracian women (so called of Ismarus, a mountaine in that country) which celebrat his festivals.

From these she wanders through the Carian bounds, The warlike Lelages, and Lycian grounds: Cragus, Lymira's streames, the siluer waues Of A River of Lycia; and not that by Troy. Xanthus past; and where See the Comment. Chimæra raues On craggy rocks; with Lyons face and mane, A Gotes rough body, and a Serpents traine. The woods were past: when thou, ô Byblis, faint With long pursuit, and passions strong constraint, Sunk'st downe; thy rufled haire on earth displaid: Thy face vpon the withered leaues low-layd. The kind Lelegian Nymphs oft in their armes Attempt to raise her: and with powrefull charmes Of counsell, striue to cure her loue-sicke mind. Which at her deafned heart no entrance find. Shee, grasping the greene rushes, silent lyes: And bathes them in the rivers of her eyes. The The water Nymphs. Naiades thrust vnder these a spring: Their bountie could not giue a greater thing. As pitch distilleth from the barks black wound, As stiffe A clammy and combustible minerall. Bitumen issues from the ground; As floods, which frosts in icie fetters bind, Thaw with th'approching Sun, and Southerne wind; Euen so Of her Grandfather Phœbus Phœbeian Byblis, spent in teares, Becomes a liuing fountaine, which yet beares Her name: and vnder a black Holme that growes In those rank vallies, plentifully flowes. The fame of this so wonderfull a fate Had Her father lately of Creet. fil'd Creets hundred Cities; if of late. The change of Iphis, generally knowne, Iphis. Had not produc't a wonder of their owne. For Phæstus, neere to Gnossus, fostered One, Lygdus, of vn-noted parents bred: How'ever, free. Nor did his wealth exceed His parentage: yet both in word and deed Sincerely iust, and of a blamelesse life. Who thus bespake his now downe-lying wife Two things I wish: that you your belly lay With little paine: and that it proue a boy. A daughter is too chargeable, and we Too poore to match her. It was vsuall among the Grecians to expose, or make those children away, which they would not, or were not able to foster. If a girle it be; I charge, what I abhorre (ô Pietie Forgiue me!) that, as soone as borne, it die. This hauing vtter'd; the Commanded wept And the Commander; teares no measure kept. Yet Telethusa still with fruitlesse praire, Desires he would not in the Gods despaire. But he too constant. Now her time was come, And the ripe burden stretcht her heauie womb: When Io the daughter of Inachus; after deified by the Ægyptians, and called Isis. Inachis, with all her sacred band; In dead of night, or stood, or seem'd to stand Besides her bed. Her browes a crowne adornes, Taken also for the Moone, as the Moone for Ceres.With eares of shining corne, and Cynthian hornes. Barking Mercury; worshipped by the Ægyptians in the forme of a dog. Anubis, and Diana; so named of Bubastis, a citty in Ægypt, where she had her Temple. Bubastis bright, Black An Oxe, adored by the Ægyptians. Apis spotted variously with white, Harpocrates, the God of Silence.He whose mouth-sealing finger silence taught, Sistrume a lowd instrument peculiar to the Ægyptians. Tymbrells, The husband of Isis: see the Comment. Osiris never enough sought, And Aspes, which the Ægyptians worshipped. forreine serpents, whose dire touch constraine A deadly slumber, consummate her traine. Then (as if seene awake) the Goddesse said: My Telethusa, be not thus dismaid; Reiect these cares, thy husband disobay: And when The Goddesse of Childbirth. Lucina shall thy belly lay, Foster what ere it be. A Deity Auxiliary to Distresse am I; Ready to helpe, and easily implor'd: Nor shall it grieue thee that thou hast ador'd Vngratefull Isis. This admonished, Shee leaues the roome. When, rising in her bed, Her hands to heauen glad Telethusa threw: And humbly prayes her vision may proue true. Increasing throwes at length a girle disclos'd. Both by the father and the world suppos'd To be a boy; so closely hid: and knowne But to the mother, and the nurse alone. Hygdes.He paies his vowes, and of his Fathers name It Iphis calls; which much reioyc't the dame, To each sex common; nor deceaues thereby: Who still with pious fraud conceales her lie. A boy in show; whose lookes should you assigne To boy or girle, loue would in either shine. At thirteene yeares her Father her asside To yellow-trest Ianthe: she the pride Of Phæstian virgins for vnequald faire: Telestes daughter, and his onely heire, Like young, like beautifull, together bred, Inform'd alike, accomplished: Like darts at once their simple bosoms strike; Alike their wounds; their hopes, ô far vnlike! The day they expect. Ianthe thought time ran Too slow; and takes her Iphis for a man. Poore Iphis loues, despaires; despaire eiects Farre fiercer flames: a maid, a maid affects. What will become of me (she weeping said) Whom new, vnknowne, prodigious loues invade! If pittifull, the Gods should haue destroy'd: Or else haue giuen what might haue beene inioy'd. No Cow a Cow, no Mare a Mare pursues: But Harts their gentle Hindes, and Rammes their Ewes. So Birds together paire. Of all that moue, No Female suffers for a Female loue. O would I had no being! Yet, that all Abhord by Nature should in Creet befall; Pasiphae. Sol's lust-incensed daughter lou'd a Bull: They male and female. Mine, ô farre more full Of vncouth fury! for she pleas'd her blood; And stood his errour in a Cow of wood: Shee, for her craft, had an adulterer. Should all the world their daring wits confer: Should Dædalus his waxen wings renue, And hither fly; what could his cunning doe! Can art convert a virgin to a boy? Or fit Ianthe for a maidens ioy? No, fixe thy minde; compose thy vast desires: O quench these ill advis'd and foolish fires! Thinke of thy sex, As well as others, by seeming what thou art not. or euen thy selfe abuse: What may be, seeke; and loue as femals vse. Hope wings desire; hope Cupids flight sustaines: In thee thy Sexe this deads. No watch restraines Our deare imbrace, nor husbands jealousies, Nor rigorous Sires; nor she her selfe denies: Yet not to be inioy'd. Nor canst thou bee Happy in her; though men and Gods agree! Now also all to my desires accord: What they can giue, the easie Gods afford; What me, my father, hers, her selfe, would please. Displeaseth Nature; stronger then all these. Shee, shee forbids. That day begins to shine; Long wisht! wherein Ianthe must be mine: And yet not mine. Of mortalls most accurst! I starue at feasts, and in the riuer thirst. Invoked at Nuptials. Iuno, ô Hymen, wherefore are you come? We both are Brides: but where is the Bride-groome? Here ended. Nor lesse burnes the other Maid; Who, Hymen, for thy swift apparance pray'd. Yet Telethusa feares what she affects; Protracting time: oft want of health obiects; Ill-boading dreames, and auguries oft faines: But now no colour for excuse remaines. Their nuptiall rites, put off with such delay; Were to be solemniz'd the following day. Were to be solemniz'd the following day. When she vnbinds, hers, and her daughters haire; And holding by the Altar form'd this praire: Isis; who A citty in Ægypt, consecrated to Isis. Parætonium, Adioyning now to Alexandria.

To me, impunitie; life, to this maid, Thy sauing counsell gaue: to both renue Thy timely pitty. Teares her words pursue. The Goddesse shakes her Altar; when the gate Shooke on the hinges: hornes that imitate The waxing Moones, through all the Temple flung A sacred splendor: noyse-full Timbrells rung. The Mother, glad of this successefull signe, Though not secure, returnes from Isis shrine. Whom Iphis followes with a larger pace Then vsuall; nor had so white a face. Her strength augments; her looke more bold appeares; Her shortning curles scarce hang beneath her eares; By farre more full of courage, rapt with ioy: For thou, of late a Wench, art now a Boy. Gifts to the Temple beare, and An acclamati? in triumphs Iö sing! Sing Ioy! Their gifts they to the Temple bring; And adde a title; in one verse display'd: What Iphis vow'd a Wench, a Boy he pay'd.

She knew't: and striuing; to her selfe thus spake: Ah whether rapt! what is't I vndertake! O Gods! O Piety! divine Respect Of Parents guard me! and this sinne eiect! If so a sinne it be. No piety Condemnes such Venus; Natures common tye. Horses their fillies back, sires Heifers beare; Gotes kids beget on those whose kids they were: Birds of that seede conceiue, whereof but late Conceiu'd themselues: nor they degenerate. Happie in this are those! But humane care Hath fram'd malignant lawes: and we who are By nature free; malitious customes bind. There is The Troglodites: a dwarfish People on the east of Æthiopia; who haue their women (as all things else) in common, without distinction of blood or aliance. a Nation to their blood more kind; Where sons their mothers, fathers daughters wed; Affection doubled by their birth and bed. Woe's me, that there I was not borne! the place Makes this a crime. What thoughts are these! Hence base, Hence wicked hopes. Though he all-worthy bee: Yet, as a father, must be lou'd by thee. Were I not daughter to great Cinyras; All I conceiue in my desires might passe. Now, in that mine, not mine: proximitie Dis-ioynes vs; neerer, were we not so nigh. Hence would I fly by vn-returning waies To shun this sinne: dire Loue my iourney stayes; To feast my hungrie eyes with his deare sight, Talke, touch, and kisse; or more, if more I might. O wicked Virgin, canst thou more propound! Knowst thou what lawes and names thy lusts confound! Thy fathers whore! a riuall to thy mother! Thy owne sonnes sister! mother to thy brother! Nor fear'st the Furies with their hissing haire, Who on the faces of the guiltie stare, With dreadfull torches! From thy soule exile This mischiefe, ere it actually defile. Nor with thy horrid lust infringe the law Of powerfull Nature: but in time with-draw. Would I, he would not: too too well inclin'd. O that like furie would inflame his mind! Thus she. But Cinyras, prest with the store Of worthie suters who his voice implore; In his owne choice irresolute, demands (Their names rehearsing) how her fancie stands. Shee, thoughtfull silent; gazing on his face, Flusht with imbosom'd flames, and wept apace. He, taking this for maiden feare, Desist From weeping, said: then dri'd her cheekes, and kist. This too much pleas'd her. Once more asked, who She best could like: repli'd, One, like to you. Be still, said he, so pious. At that name She hung the head, as conscious of her blame. Twas now the mid of night: when Sleepe bestowes On men, and on their cares, a sweet repose. But Myrrha watches, rapt with raging fires; Retracting her implacable desires. Despaires, hopes; will not, will; now shames, againe Desires; nor knowes what course to take. As when A mighty Oke (now almost feld) his fall On each side threatens; and is fear'd on all: Euen so her minde, impair'd with various wounds, Waues to and fro; and changes still propounds. No meane, no cure, was left for loue but death: Death pleas'd. Resolu'd to choake her hated breath; Vp-starting, to a beame her girdle ties. Deare Cinyras farewell (she softly cries) And of my ruine vnderstand the cause. That said, the noose about her neck she drawes. Her wakefull Nurses faithfull eares, they say, A whispering heard: who in the Lobby lay. Straight rose; vnlockt the doores; the instrument Of death beholding, schreecht: together rent Her haire and bosome: and, with trembling haste, The girdle from her pallid neck displac't. Now had she time to weepe; t'imbrace her Care: And aske the cause of such accurst despaire. She, silent, fixes on the earth her eyes: And grieues at deaths prevented enterprise. Bearing her hoary haires and empty brest, The Nurse, by her The milke which she suckt from her brest. first food, and cradle, prest Her griefes disclosure. Myrrha turnes aside, And sighes. The Nurse would not be so denied: Nor onely promist secrecie; but said: Tell me, my child, and entertaine my aid. My old age is not fruitlsse: charmes haue we, And powerfull med'cines, if it furie be: If witchcraft; magick shall thy torments ease: If wrath of Gods; the Gods we will appease With sacrifice. What can be else surmiz'd? Thy fortunes by incursions vnsurpriz'd: Thy mother, and thy father, well? That name Drew from her soule a sigh, that scorcht like flame. Nor in the Nurse did this suspition moue Of such a Crime: and yet she saw 'twas Loue. Importunate to knowe what least she feares, Layd in her lap now watred with her teares, Sh'infolds her in her feeble armes, and said; I knowe thou lou'st: wherein (nor be afraid) Thou maist on my sedulity rely: Nor shall thy father ever this descry. At that, in furie from her lap she sprung; Then on the bed her prostrate body flung; Muffling her guilty lookes: Be gone, she said, And spare the blushes of a wretched maid. Still vrg'd: Begone, replyde; or else forbeare T'inquire of that which is a sinne to heare. The Nurse lost in amaze her hands with yeares And terror trembling (kneeling to her) reares: Now speakes her faire, now threatens to disclose (Vnlesse she made her privie to her woes) Her purpos'd violence: and vowes to proue Both secret, and assistant to her loue. At that, her head she rais'd; her Nurses brest With weeping bathes: oft stroue to haue confest; As oft with-held: at length she hid her head; And said, ô Mother, happy in thy bed! There ends: then grones. The Nurse cold horror shooke; Now too much knowing: with a gastly looke, Her hoarie haire star'd on her head: Who said, What not? that might so foule a lust disswade, The Virgin could not such a truth deny: But stands resolu'd, or to possesse, or die. Liue, said she, and possesse (there stopt, as loath To say; thy Sire) and bound it with an oath. Now Matrons celebrate the yearely Feast Of Ceres; whom long linnen stoles invest: And offer garlands of their first ripe corne; Forbidden Venus for nine nights forborne, And touch of man. In spotlesse ornaments, With these, the Queene her secret Rites frequents. Lying alone, Her Nurse. the leaudly diligent Doth Cinyras, o're-charg'd with wine, present With proffer of true loue, though falsely maskt: And prais'd her beauty. Of what age being askt? Of equall age with Myrrha, she replyes. When bid to bring her: home in haste she highes; Reioyce, said she, I bring thee victory. Th'vnhappy Virgin felt but little ioy; Such ill successe her troubled Soule divin'd: And yet she ioy'd: such discord rackt her minde. Now Silence ouer all the world did raigne: And slow A constellation following the Waine, or those seauen starres, which wheele about the Northerne Pole. Boötes had declin'd his Waine. (To sinne addrest) from heauen bright The Moone, of Cynthus a mountaine of Delos. Cynthia flies; Starres shroud their heads in clouds: Night lost her eyes.

Thrice stumbled she; the funerall Owle thrice rent The ayre with ominous shreekes: yet on she went: By pitchy Night, of modesty bereft. Her Nurses right hand holding with her left, And groping with the other hand, explores Her blind accesse. Now came she to the doores Of that dire chamber; now the way to sinne She boldly opens; and now enters in. Yet blood and courage her at once forsooke; Her knees, vnknitting, one another strooke: The neerenesse to her crime remoues desire: Who now repents, and would vnknowne retire. Protracting, by the hand the Nurse her led; And, hauing rendred her vnto his bed, Here Cyneras, said she, receiue thy owne. And ioynes their cursed bosoms. He, vnknowne, His bowels to his bed assumes: and cheares With comfortable words, her mayden feares: By chance he call'd her daughter, (being old) And she him father: that their names might hold. Now his incestuous bed his daughter leaues. With wicked seed her cursed wombe conceaues: Who beares about the burden of her shame: Next night, and next, and next, re-acts the same: When Cinyras, who longs to see his Louer, So oft imbrac't; did with a light discouer His sinne, and daughter. Sorrow not a word Could vtter: he vnsheaths his shining sword. Shee swiftly flies: whom nights black shelter shields From threatned death; and strayes through spacious fields. Palme-clad Arabia Petræa; beyond which lies Arabia Fœlix, containing the countries of Panchæa and Sabæa. Arabia, and Panchæa past; Now hauing wandred by nine Moones, at last Rest to her wearie limbs Sabæa gaue. Charg'd with her womb; not knowing what to craue; Betweene the hate of life, and feare of death, Those thoughts she vtters with her fainting breath. You Powers! If Penitency pierce your eare; I haue deserued, nor refuse to beare, Your iust inflictions: yet least I prophane Or those who liue, or who in death remaine, O banish me from either Monarchie; That, chang'd by you, I may nor liue, nor die! Confession some cœlestiall pittie found. Those wishes had their Gods. Euen then the ground Couer'd her legs: a downe-ward-spreading root Burst from her toes; whose ever-fixed foot Sustain'd the lengthfull bole. Bones turne to wood, To pith her marrow, into sap her blood: Her armes great branches grow, her fingers spine To little twigs; her skin converts to rine. Now her big womb the rising tree possest, Her bosome folds, and now her neck opprest: When shee, delay il-brooking, downeward shrunk And vales her visage in the closing trunk. Though sense, with shape, she lost, still weeping, she Sheds bitter teares, which trickle from her tree: Teares of high honour; these their Mistresse name As yet preserue, and still shall beare the same. This ill-got infant, now at perfect groth Within the tree; indeavours to get forth. The strict imbracing barke, her belly wrung, With torment stretcht: nor had that griefe a tongue: Nor could she call The Goddesse of Childbirth. Lucina to her throwes: And yet the tree like one in labour showes; Bowes downe with paine, and grones, and weeps a flood. Lucina by her trembling branches stood; Her hand impos'd, and vtterd powerfull words. The yawning tree the crying Babe affords A passage; whom those Nymphs receiue with ioy: And in his mothers teares annoint the Boy. Nor Envy could but praise his beauty: so The naked Cupids, liuely painted, show. But, least their habits some distinction make; A quiver giue, or his from Cupid take. Time glides away with vndiscouered hast; Venvs and Adonis. And mocks our hopes: no wings can fly so fast. He, whom his sister bore, his grandsires son; Late tree-inclos'd, who lately life begun, But now a most sweet infant, now as rare, A boy, now man, now then himselfe more faire. And now on Venus for his mothers fires Revenge inflicts; who dotingly admires. For kist by quiver-bearing Loue, his dart By fortune raz'd her tender brest; with smart Incenst, she thrust him from her nor then found The wounds deceitfull-depth, yet deep the wound. Not now An Iland in the Ægean Sea whereof Venus was called Cytheræa. Cythera could the Louer please; Not Cyprus; or rather a citty in that Iland renowned for her Temple. Paphos, grasped with resulting Seas. High An Iland 'neere Rhodes, where she had her Temple and celebrated statue. Gnidos, A citty of Cyprus. Amathus, renown'd for brasse, Nor heauen frequents: her heauen Adonis was. Him woo's, accompanies, besides him lies In gratefull shades; and striues to please his eyes. Now like Diana she her selfe attires; And trips o're hils and rocks, through brakes and briers: Hollowes the hound; pursuing beasts of chace, Bucks, high-hornd Harts, and Hares, who fly apace: But rapefull Wolues, rough Beares, fell Bores eschues; And Lyons, whom the blood of Beeues imbrues. And thee Adonis, her misdoubts disswade From such encounters; had they beene obayd. Who fly, said she, be bold in following those: Valour vnsafely copes with valiant foes. Sweet Boy! subiect not me to fortunes stroke; Nor cruell beasts by nature arm'd prouoke, For feare such glory but too costly proue. Thy youth and beauty, though they Venus moue; Nor bristled Swine, nor shaggie Lyon touch: Pitty ne'r pierc't the eyes nor hearts of such. Bores, in their crooked rushes lightning haue: And Lyons with impetuous furie raue. I hate them. Asked why? We will relate Old crimes, said she, and wonder-striking fate. But now vn-vsuall toyle my strength invades: And loe, you Poplar courts vs with her shades; The grasse affords a bed: there let vs rest. When, lying downe, the grasse and him she prest. Her head now in her Louers bosome laid: Thus (words with kisses intermixing) said. Perhaps you of a maid haue heard, who wan Hippomones and Atalanta. The Prize in running from the swiftest man. 'Tis true; She, won indeed: nor could you tell Whether her speed or beauty did excell. Enquiring of a husband; this reply Apollo gaue. The vse of husband fly O Atalant! yet thou shalt vainely striue Against thy fate; and loose thy selfe aliue. Frighted herewith in shadie woods she liues: And troopes of pressing Sutors from her driues With this reply: Except out-runne I be, I am a wife for no man; Runne with me. My bed, and I, are both the winners meede: The Tardie dies. Vpon this law proceed. She, cruell: yet so powrefull was her looke, That many a youth the perill vndertooke. Hippomenes beheld this tragick strife. Will any through such danger seeke a wife? (Said He) and taxt their follies that pursewd. But when her face and naked forme he viewd; Such as is mine; or Thine, wer't thou a Maid: Amaz'd! with hands vpheau'd, forgiue (he said) O you whom late I blam'd! not then I knew The Prizes worth. Loue still by praising grew: Who wishes now that none might runne so fast: Envies and feares. Why linger, I, nor hast (Said he) to trie my fortune? Gods still aid The adventurous. While this in thought he said; The Virgin with a winged pace past by. Though seeming to Hippomenes of Aonia, after called Bæotica. th' Aonian Youth to flye As swift as Scythian shafts; her forme he more Admires; by motion louelier then before. The winde reverberates her ankles Those who anciently ran races, wore little wings tied to their heeles (in imitation of Mercury the messenger of the Gods, and swiftest of the Planets) to expresse their celerity: worne also by the Roman Posts on their shoulders wings, And whisks her ham-bound buskins purple strings, Tossing her haire, on ivory shoulders spred. Her pure white body so receaues the red; As when carnation curtaines are display'd On pure white walls, &amp; dye them with their shade. While this the stranger viewd, the race was run: And Atalanta's browes the garland won. The vanquisht sighe, and pay their forfeiture. Nor could so sad successe his feare procure: Who rose; and fixing on the Maid his eyes; Why seeke you praise by easie victories? Contend with vs: if we obtaine the Bayes, Our victory will not eclipse your praise. Megareus me begot, The sonne of Neptune and father of Megarius. Onchestius blood; He Neptunes, Ruler of the sacred Flood: Nor we degenerate. My foyle, your name Will honour; and immortalize your fame. This while, a wel-pleas'd eye She on him threw: Nor knowes her wish; to loose, or to subdue. What God, a Foe to beauty, would destroy This Youth, said she, who seekes my bed t'inioy With his lifes forfeiture? If I may be The iudge, there is not so much worth in me. Nor is't his beautie moues, though it might moue; But that a Boy. We pittie, and not loue. Besides; his courage, and contempt of death! Who from great Neptunes Onchestius the son of Neptune being his Grand-father. son deriues his birth! And then, his Loue; content to part with life, If harder fate denie me for his wife! Be gon, ô Stranger; shun my bloody bed, While yet thou maist: this March will loose thy head. No Virgin is there who would not be thine: And such would seeke, whose lustres darken mine. Yet why regard I him, so many slaine? Looke to thy selfe, or perish: since in vaine Admonisht by such numbers, whom this strife Hath sent to death. Th'art weary of thy life. And must he dye, because hee'd liue with me? Must death, adventurous Loue, thy wages be? This murder will our victory defame; And purchace hate: yet am not I in blame. O would thou wouldst desist, and danger shun! Or since so mad, would thou couldst faster run! How Boy and Virgin glory in his face! Ah poore Hippomenes! O would this place, Th'hadst neuer seene! thou well deseru'st to liue. Were I more happy, and hard fate would giue Me leaue to marry; thou art He alone, To whom my bed and beauties should be knowne. Thus she: Who raw, and pierc't with loues first touch, Erres in her thoughts; and loues; nor knewe so much. Now King and People call vpon the Race: When Hippomenes.

This friendly winds convaid vnto my eare: I pitty, and no longer helpe forbeare. A field there is, so fertill none, through all Rich Cyprus; which they Damascenus call. Antiquitie this to my honour vow'd: And therewith all my Temples had indow'd. A Tree there flourisht on that pregnant mold, Whose glittering leaues, and branches, shone with gold. Three golden apples, gathered from that tree, By chance I brought: and, so as none could see, Himselfe excepted, to Hippomenes; Together with their vse, deliuer'd these. The trumpets sound. Both from the A Bar which restrained the runners vntill the signe was giuen; and then let downe, that they might start together. Barrier start: Whose nimble steps scarce touch earths vpper part.

Favour and Clamor, ioyning in remorse, The youth thus hearten: Now thy speed inforce, Make haste Hippomenes; delay decline; Collect thy powers: the victory is thine. 'Tis doubtfull whether, what the people said, More ioy'd the Heroes or Atalanta the daughter of Schæneus. Schæneian Maid. How often lag'd she, when she might o're-goe! And gazing on him, sigh't t'out-strip him so! Short breath from panting bosomes scorching flew; The Gole farre off: when Neptunes Nephew threw One apple of the three. The Maid admires: And greedy of the shining fruit, retires To catch the rowling gold: the Youth past by; And all the field resounded shouts of ioy. This hindrance she repaires with winged hast: Againe Hippomenes behind her cast. The second fruit, throwne farther then before, Declin'd her steps; yet him out-strips once more: The Race now neere an end, he said, ô saue! Great Goddesse, giue successe to what you gaue! And threw the shining gold another way With all his vigor; to prolong her stay. When I compeld her, doubtfull what to doe, To take it vp; and added waight thereto: With-held; both by diverting her pursuit; And with the burden of the ponderous fruit. But least my words the Race in length exceed; She was out-run, and he receiu'd his Meed. Deseru'd not I both thanks and frankincense, Thinke you Adonis, for his lifes defence? He neither gaue.

When yellow maines on their smooth shoulders fall; Their armes, to legs; their fingers turne to nailes; Their brests of wondrous strength: their tufted tailes Whiske vp the dust; their lookes are full of dread; For speech, they rore: the woods become their bed. These Lyons, feard by others, Cybel checks With curbing bits; and yokes their stubborne necks.

This said: thence flew Shee, rais'd by yoked Swans. But Valour such admonishments with-stands. By chance the dogs, pursuing long before His sented footings, had dislog'd a Bore. Whom, rushing from his covert, the bold Youth Obliquely wounds. The Bore with crooked tooth Writhes out the jauelin, with his blood imbrude.

Then turnes his heeles to flight (much like a Bull By Hornets stung) whom scratching brambles pull: Yet seem'd to run far faster then a man, As if his feet had wings; and all out-ran.

Yet first to thee his secret purpose told, Faith-crown'd Alcyone. An inward cold Shot through her bones: her changing face appeares As pale as box, bedewed with her teares. Thrice stroue to speak, thrice weeps through deare constraint: Sobs interrupting her diuine complaint. What fault of mine, my Life, hath chang'd thy minde? Where is that loue that late so clearely shin'd? Canst thou thy selfe enioy, from me remou'd? Doe long waies please? is now my absence lou'd? Yet didst thou goe by land, I should alone Grieue without feare: now both combine in one. Seas fright me with their tragicall aspect. Of late I saw them on the shore eiect Their scattered wracks: and often haue I read Sad names on Presentatiue Sepulchers, in honour of such as were drowned. sepulchers that want their dead. Nor let false hopes thy confidencie please; In that my father, great Hippotades, The strugling windes in rockie cauernes keepes. And at his pleasure calmes the raging Deepes. They once broke loose submit to no command; But rage through all the Sea, on all the land; Perplex the clouds, with sterne encounters rore, And strike forth flames: I feare, by knowledge, more. These knew I, and oft saw their rude comport; While yet a Girle, within my fathers Court. But if my prayers no fauour can procure; And that, alas, thy going be too sure; Take me along: let both one fortune beare; Then shall I onely what I suffer feare. Together saile we on the toyling Maine: And equally what'euer hap sustaine. Thus spake Alcyone: whose sorrowes melt Ceyx the son of Lucifer, or the morning starre.Her Æolus: of Hippotes the father of his mother Acasta. star-like spouse; nor he lesse passion felt. Yet neither would his first intent forsake Nor her a Partner in his danger make. Much said he to asswage her troubled brest: As much in vaine. This addes vnto the rest, (Which answer only could her passion tame) All stay is irkesome; by Lucifers my fathers Flame, I sweare, if Fate permit, returne I will E're twice the Moone her shining Crescents fill. Reuiu'd with promise of so short a stay; He bids them lanch the ship without delay, And fit her tacklings. This renewes her feares; Presaging ill successe: abortiue teares Flow from their springs; then kist: a sad farewell, Long first, at length she takes; and swowning, fell. The Sea-men call aboard: in double ranks. Reduce their oares, vp-rising from their Banks With equall strokes. She reares her humid eyes, And first her husband on the Poope espies Shaking his hand: that, answers. Now from shore The vessel driues, and thence her obiect bore Her following eyes the flying ship pursue: That lost, the sailes her eager gazes drew. When all had left her, to her chamber goes; And on the emptie bed her body throwes: The bed and place, with teares, to minde recall That absent part, which gaue esteeme to all. Now farre from Port; the windes began to blow On quiuering Shrowds; their oares the Sailers stow: Then hoise their Yards a trip, and all their sailes At once let fall to catch th' approching gales. The ship scarce halfe her course, or sure no more, By this had runne; farre off from either shore: When, deepe in night, fierce The East wind. Eurus stifly blew, And high-wrought Seas with chafing foamie grew. Strike, strike the Top-saile, let the Maine-shear fly, And furle your sailes, the Master cri'd; his cry The blustring winds and roring seas suppresse. Yet of their owne accord in this distresse They plie their tasks: some seeling yards bestride And take-in sailes; some stop on either side The yawning leakes; some seas on seas eiect. While thus Disorder toyles to small effect, The bitter Storme augments; the wild Windes wage Warre from all parts, and ioyne with Neptunes rage. The Master, lost in terror, neither knew The state of things, what to command, or doe; Confessing ignorance; so huge a masse O fills oppresse! which slighted Art surpasse. Lowd cryes of men resound; with ratling shrowds, Floods iustling floods, and thunder-crashing clouds. Now tossing Seas appeare to touch the sky, And wrap their curles in clouds, frotht with their spry: The sand now from the bottome laue, and take Their swarter dye; now black, A lake of Hell. as Stygian lake; Sometimes deprest, with hissing foame all white. The Of Trachis, whereof Ceyx was King. Trachin ship such horrid changes fright. Which now, as from a mountaine rockt with flawes, Viewes vnder-vales, and Hell; of Acheron an infernall Riuer. Acherons darke jawes: Now head-long with the tumbling billowes fell; And heauen suruayes from that low depth of Hell. Her waue-beat sides a hideous noyse report: As when a battering A great engine of timber, shod with brasie, fashioned like the head of a Ram, vsed anciently at seiges, to break downe the walls of citties &amp; fortresses. Ram beats downe a Fort. As chafed Lyons, whom no terrors fright, Rush on extended steele with horrid might: So Seas inuade with storme-imbatled powre The ships defence; and o're her hatches towre. Her yeelding planks now spring: sterne Neptune raues, Charging her breaches with his deadly waues. The prodigall clouds in showres their substance spend: Ambitious seas to gloomie heauen ascend; All heauen descending to the loftie Maine: At least so seeme. Sailes suck the falling raine; Showres ioyne with floods. No friendly star now shone: Blind Night in darknesse, tempests, and her owne Dread terrors lost: these horrid lightning turnes To light more fear'd; the Sea with lightning burnes. Now vaulting floods her vpper deck opprest. And as a Souldier, brauer then the rest, Tempting to scale the walls with lost assaies, At length inioyes his hopes; and spurd with praise, Among a thousand only stands the shock: So while assailing waues the vessel rock, The Obserued heretofore for the greatest: wherevpon the tenth in all things is taken. tenth bold Billow rusheth in, nor shrinks Vntill the ship beneath his furie sinks. Those seas, without, the labouring Bark assaile: These sack her Hold. All tremble, and looke pale; As at a siege, when foes inforce a wall; While some within to execution fall. Art failes, hearts sinck: on euery rising waue Death sits in triumph, and presents a graue. He weepes; He stands amaz'd; He calls them blest Whom funerals grace: He vowes to heauen addrest, Looking at what he sees not, and besought The Gods in vaine: He on his parents thought, His children, house, and what he left behinde. Alcyone possest all Ceyx minde; Her onely names: now in her absence ioy'd Whose presence was his heauen: and had imploy'd His eyes last duty to descrie the way To her abode; but knew not where it lay. The giddie seas so whirle, such pitchie clouds Obscure the skie: Night, two-fold darknesse shrouds. Lowd howling whirle-winds ouer-boor'd now bore The shiuered mast; and now the rudder tore. A Billow with these spoyles incourag'd, raues; Who Victor-like contemnes the vnder waues: Nor lighter falls, then if some God had torne Two high mountaines; the one of Thessaly, and the other of Alacidon. Pindus and Athos from their roots, vp-borne As high as heauen, and tumbled on the Maine. Nor could the ship such force and waight sustaine; But to the bottome sinks. Most of her men The seas infold; who neuer seene againe Accomplished their fates: while other swim On scattered plankes; a planke vpholding Him Who late a scepter held. Æolus the father of his wife Alcyone. His father in law, And Lucifer. father, now inuokes: but could not draw (Alas!) from either succour. Still his wife Runnes in his thoughts in that short span of life He wisht the waues would cast him on the sand, Of Trachis, to be buried by her hands. Who swimming, sighs Alcyone; her name His last-of speech: in seas conceaues the same Behold; an arch of waters, black as hell, Asunder breakes: the breaking surges quell Their sinking Burthen. Lucifer that night Became obscure; nor could you see his light. And since he might not render vp his place, With pitchie clouds immur'd his darkned face. Meane-while Alcyone, (his fate vnknowne) Computes the tedious nights; by day wrought on A garment for her Lord; another makes To weare her selfe: whose flattering hope mistakes In his returne. Who holy fumes presents To all the Gods; but most of all frequents The Fane of Iuno: at her altars prayd For him that was not. Grant successe! (she said) A quick returne! Giue he our right to none! Of all her prayers the last succeeds alone. The melting Goddesse could no longer brooke Her death-crost prayers; but from her altar shooke For such as had any dead in their family were held to be polluted; nor allowed to sacrifice vntill they were purified.Her tainted hand; and thus to The Raine-bow. Iris spake: Haste faithfull Messenger, thy iourney take To drowsie Sleepes dimme pallace: bid him send A dreame that may present the wofull end Of Ceyx to Alcyone. This said; She, in a thousand-coloured robe arraid, Her ample Bow from heauen to earth extends: And in a cloud to his abode descends. Neere the A people who dwell between the Euxian sea and the Lake of Meotis Cimmerians lurks a Caue, in steepe And hollow hills; the Mansion of dull Sleepe: Not seene by Phœbus when he mounts the skies, At height, nor stooping: gloomie mists arise From humid earth, which still a twi-light make.

Heben caue a downie bed High mounted stands, with sable couerings spred. Here lay the lazie God, dissolu'd in rest. Fantastick Dreames, who various formes exprest, About him lay: then Autumn's eares far more; Or leaues of trees, or sands on Neptunes shore. The Virgin entring, parts the obuious Dreames: And fills the sacred Concaue with the beames Of her bright robe. The God with strife disioynes His seeled lids; againe his head declines, And knocks his chin against his brest. Anon Sleepe casts off Sleepe; and softly leaning on His elbow, asketh (for he knewe her) why Shee thither came? when Iris made reply: Thou Rest of things, most meeke of all the Gods; O Sleepe, the Peace of mindes, from whose abodes Care euer flies; restoring the decay Of toile-tir'd limbs to labour-burdning Day: Send thou a Dreame, resembling truth, in post T' Built by Hercules. Herculean Trachis; that like Ceyx Ghost, May to Alcyone his wrack vnfold. Iuno the daughter of Saturn Saturnia this commands. Her message told, Iris with-drew; who could the power of Sleepe Resist no longer. When she found it creepe Vpon her yeelding senses, thence she flies: And by her painted Bow remounts the skies. The Sire among a thousand sonnes, excites Shape-faining Signifying forme.

His eyes then close Their drowsie lids, and hanging downe his head, Opprest with slumber, shrinks into his bed.

Or am I chang'd in death? looke on the Lost And for thy husband thou shalt see his Ghost. Thy pious prayers no fauour could obtaine: Lo, I am drown'd, no longer hope in vaine.

Wak't with her voice, and husbands ghost; with feare Shee lookes about for that which was not there. For now the maids, rais'd with her shreekes, had brought A taper in. Not finding what she sought, She strikes her cheekes, her nightly linnen tare, Invades her brest; nor stayes t'vnbind her haire, But tugs it off. Her Nurse the cause demands Of such a violence. She wrings her hands, And in the passion of her griefe repli'd: There's no Alcyone; none, none! she dy'd: Together with her Ceyx. Silent be All sounds of comfort.

Then whisks the brand about his browes; assailes The valiant Dryas; but no more preuailes: For through his shoulder, who had triumpht long In daily slaughter, Dryas fixt his prong.

Demoleon frets to see Theseus the son of Ææus. Ægides thriue With such successe; and from the center striues To teare a Pine: which when he could not, riues The yeelding bole, and darts it at his foe. Theseus farre off espi'd the deadly throw; Who by Minerua's counsell (for so he Would haue vs thinke) with-drew: and yet the tree Not idly fell; but Crantors shoulder, brest, And throte divides; which tortur'd life releast.

When Peleus saw that spectacle of ruth; Receiue, ô Crantor, ô beloued youth, This sacrifice, he said: and sent a dart With all the rigor of his hand and heart At proud Demoleon; which the bones that ioyne His ribs transfixt; and quauer'd in the chine.

Nor thee thy beauty, Cyllarus, could saue: If such a two-form'd figure beautie haue.

A jauelin from the left hand flung, thy brest O Cyllarus, beneath thy neck imprest. His heart though slightly hurt (the dart out-hal'd) Grew forth-with cold; and all his body pal'd.

Then rushing on, with thrusts assayes to wound His hardned sides; the sword no entrance found. Nor shalt thou scape; the edge shall lanch thy throate, Although the point be dull. This said, and smote At once. The blow, as if on marble, sounds: And from his neck the broken blade rebounds. When he his charmed limmes had open laid Enough to wounds and wonder, Cæneus said: Now will we try, if thou our sword canst feele.

Sometimes He faints; then struggles to aduance his crowne Aboue the Pile, and throw the timber downe: Sometimes the burthen with his motion quakes; As when an earth-quake A mountaine aboue Troy in sight of the Grecian Navy. high-brow'd Ida shakes. His end was doubtfull: some there be, who tell How with that weight his body sunke to hell. The Prophet.

Imploide at euery need. Homer. Iliad 12The King deluded in his sleepe by Ioue, Bids vs the care of future warre remoue. The author was his strong apologie. Aiax should haue with-stood: the sack of Troy He should haue vrg'd; done what he could, haue fought. Why was the nobler seige by him vnsought? Why arm'd he not? a speech he might haue made, That would the wauering multitude haue staid: To him not difficult, who lookes so high, And speakes so bigge. What, if himselfe did fly? I saw, and sham'd to see thee turne thy back To hoyse thy sailes vnto thy honours wrack. What doe you? ô what madnesse, mates, said I Prouokes you to abandon yeelding Troy? Ten yeares nigh spent, what will you beare away But infamie? I this, and more did say; Wherein my sorrow made me eloquent: They thus perswaded, alterd their intent. The King a Councell calls; distrusts afford No sound aduice: durst Aiax speake a word? When base A railing Grecian, not lesse deformed in body then in mind. Thersites durst the King prouoke With bitter words: who felt my scepters stroke. Their doubts with hope of conquest I inspire: And set their fainting courages on fire. Since when, what Agamemnon. he hath nobly done, by right To me belongs, that thus restrain'd his flight. Besides, what one of all the wiser Greekes Makes choice of thee; or thy assistance seekes? Diomedes, the son of Tydeus: who in most of his enterprizes made choice of Vlisses for his companion. Tydides vs approues, builds on our will; Is confident in his Vlysses still. Among so many, 'tis a grace for me To be his consort; and the choice so free. Homer Iliad. 10.The danger of the foe, and night despisd; I Dolon, then a counter-scout, surprisd: Nor him, till I had searcht his bosome, slew; Informed what perfidious Troy would doe.

Can you then deny Achilles armes, Delon, vpon compact, if the Troians has ouercome, was to haue had Achilles horses in reward of that nights discouery. whose horses were assign'd For one nights hazard?

No blood for Greece in all these lengthfull warres Made by Hercules invulnerable.Hath Aiax shed: let him produce his scarres. What boots it, though his deeds his brags approue; That for our fleete he fought with Troy and Ioue? I grant, he did so: nor will we detract With hated enuie from a noble act. So he ingrosse not to himselfe alone A common praise, but render vs our owne.

And while the wretched said; You Women of Troy. Troades, A pitcher bring to draw the brinish Seas: She saw the cast-vp corps of Polydor Stuck full of wounds vpon the beachie shore.

And crauing conference, the Tyrant told How she would shew him summes of hidden gold To giue her Polydor. This held for true; He thirsty of his prey, with her with-drew. And flattering her thus craftily begun: Delay not, Hecuba, t'inrich thy sonne: By all the Gods we iustly will restore What thou shalt giue, and what thou gau'st before. She with a truculent aspect beheld The falsely swearing King: with anger swel'd.

Although himselfe he please; and pleaseth thee, (Which frets me most) could I your darling get, He then should finde my strength and me like great.

'Twas wonderous strange: but that his lookes appeare More blew, and he more great, it Acis were. And so it was: although he now became A liuing streame, which still preserues his name.

On this nor horned cattle euer fed, Nor harmlesse sheepe, nor goats on mountaines bred. No bees from hence their thighes with hony lade; Those flowres no marriage garlands euer made: That grasse ne'r cut with sithes. Of mortals I First thither came; my nets hung vp to drie. While I expos'd the fishes which I tooke; By their credulity hung on my hooke, Or masht in nets; (what would a lye behoue? Yet such it seemes) my prey began to moue, Display their sinnes, and swim as on the flood. While I neglect their stay, and wondering stood; They all by flight auoiding my command, Together left their owner and the land. Amaz'd, and doubting long; the cause I sought, If either God, or Hearb, this wonder wrought. What hearb, said I, hath such a powre? in hast An hearb I puld, and gaue it to my tast. No sooner swallowed, but my entrailes shooke: When forth-with I another nature tooke. Nor could refraine; but said, ô Earth, my last Farewell receiue! in seas my selfe I cast. The Sea-gods now vouchsafing my receit Into their sacred fellowship, intreat Both Tethys and Oceanus, that they Would take, what euer mortall was, away. Whom now they hallow, and with charmes nine times Repeated, purge me from my humane crimes: And bade me diue beneath a hundred streames.

As soone as streames retire, and seas were downe, An other body, and an other minde; Vnlike the former, they to me assign'd. Thus much of Wonder I remember well: Thenceforth insensible of what befell. Then first of all this sea-greene beard I saw, These dangling locks, which through the deepe I draw; Broad shoulder-blades, blew armes of greater might; And thighes which in a fishes taile vnite.

Since on so vast a sea, my saile's vnfurld, And stretcht to rising winds; in all the World The vicissitvde of things. There's nothing permanent; all ebbe and flow: Each image form'd to wander too and fro. Euen time, with restlesse motion, slides away Like liuing streames: nor can swift Riuers stay, Nor light-heel'd Howers. As billow billow driues, Driuen by the following; as the next arriues To chace the former: times so flye, persue At once each other; and are euer new. What was before, is not; what was not, is: All in a moment change from that to this. See, how the Night on Light extends her shades: See, how the Light the gloomie Night inuades. Nor such Heauens hew, when Mid-night crown's repose, As when bright The Day-starres Lucifer his taper showes: Yet changing, when the Harbinger of Day Th'inlightned World resignes to The Sunnes. Phœbus sway.

Nor can Night-wandring The Moones. Dian's wauering light Be euer equall, or the same: this night Lesse then the following, if her hornes shee fill; If shee contract her Circle, greater still. Doth not the image of our age appeare In the successiue quarters of the Yeare? The Spring-tide, tender; sucking Infancie Resembling: then the juycefull blade sprouts high; Though tender, weake; yet hope to Plough-men yeelds: All things then flourish: flowers the gaudie fields With colours paint: no vertue yet in leaues. Then following Summer greater strength receiues: A lustie Youth: no age more strength acquires, More fruitfull, or more burning in desires. Maturer Autumne, heat of Youth alaid, The sober meane twixt youth and age, more staid And temperate, in Summers waine repaires: His reuerent temples sprinkled with gray haires. Then comes old Winter, void of all delight, With trembling steps: his head or bal'd, or white. So change our bodies without rest or stay: What wee were yester-day, nor what to day, Shall bee to morrow. Once alone of men The seeds and hope; the womb our mansion: when Kind Nature shewd her cunning; not content That our vext bodies should be longer pent In mothers stretched entrailes, forth-with bare Them from that prison, to the open aire. Wee strenghtlesse lye, when first of light possest; Straight creepe vpon all foure, much like a beast; Then, staggering with weak nerues, stand by degrees, And by some stay support our feeble knees: Now, lustie, swiftly run. Our Youth then past, And those our middle times, wee post in hast To inevitable Age: this last deuoures The former, and demolisheth their powres. Old A Wrastler of Crotona, famous for his prodigious strength. Milo wept, when he his armes beheld, Which late the strongest beast in strength exceld, Big, as Hercules. Alcides brawnes, in flaggie hide Now hanging by slack sinewes: Helen cry'd When shee beheld her wrinkles in her Glasse; And asks her selfe, why she By Theseus first, and after by Paris. twice rauisht was. Still-eating Time, and thou ô enuious Age, All ruinate: diminisht by the rage Of your deuouring teeth, All that haue breath Consume, and languish by a lingring death. Nor can these Elements stand at a stay: But by exchanging alter euery day. Th'eternall world foure bodies comprehends, Ingendring all. The heauie Earth descends, So Water, clog'd with weight: two light, aspire, Deprest by none; pure Aire, and purer Fire. And though they haue their seuerall seates; yet all Of these are made, to these againe they fall. Resolued Earth to Water rarifies; To Aire extenuated Waters rise; The Aire, when it it selfe againe refines, To elementall Fire extracted, shines. They in like order back againe repaire: The grosser Fire condenseth into Aire; Aire, into Water: Water thickning, then Growes solid, and conuerts to Earth againe. None holds his owne: for Nature euer joyes In change, and with new formes the old supplies. In all the world not any perish quite: But onely are in various habits dight. For; to begin to be, what we before Were not, is to be borne; to dye, no more Then ceasing to be such: all though the frame Be changeable, the substance is the same. For nothing long continues in one mold. You Ages, you to Siluer grew from Gold; To Brasse from Siluer; and to Ir'ne from Brasse. Euen places oft such change of fortunes passe: Where once was solid land, Seas haue I seene; And solid land, where once deepe Seas haue beene. Such haue I seene in America.Shels, far from Seas, like quarries in the ground; And anchors haue on mountaine tops been found. Torrents haue made a valley of a plaine; High hills by deluges borne to the Maine. Deepe standing lakes suckt drie by thirstie sand; And on late thirstie earth now lakes doe stand. Here Nature, in her changes manifold, Sends forth new fountaines; there, shuts vp the old. Streames, with impetuous earth-quakes, heretofore Haue broken forth; or sunk, and run no more. So Lycus, swallowed by the yawning Earth, Lycvs. Takes in an other world his second birth. So Erasinus, now is hid, now yeelds Erasinvs. His rising waters to Argolian fields. And Mysus, his first head and bancks disclam'd, Mysvs. Else-where ascends and is Caïcus nam'd. Coole Amasenus, watering Sicily, Amasenvs. Now fills his bancks; now leaues his channell dry.

Or if Bitumen doe the fire prouoke; Or sulpher burning with more subtill smoke: When Earth that food and oylie nourishment With-drawes, the matter by long feeding spent; The hungrie fire of sustenance bereft, Ill-brooking famine, leaues by being left. Tritons Lake. In Hyperborean Pallene liue A People, if to fame wee credit giue, Who, diuing three time thrice in Tritons lake, Of Fowle the feathers and the figure take.

This breeding Corps a little Phœnix beares: Which is it selfe to liue as many yeares.

Lynx.The Lynx, first brought from conquered India By vine-bound Bacchus, his hot pisse, they say, Corall.Congeales to stone. So Corall, which below The water is a limber weed, doth grow Stone-hard, when toucht by aire. But Day will end, And Phæbus panting Steeds to Seas descend, Before my scant oration could persue All sorts of shapes, that change their old for new. For this wee see in all is generall. Some Nations gather strength, and others fall. Troy, rich and powrefull, which so proudly stood; That could for ten yeares spend such streames of blood; For buildings, onely her old ruines showes; For riches, tombs; which slaughtred Sires inclose. Sparta, Mycenæ, were of Greece the flowres; Athens, of Cecrops the first King.So Cecrop's Citie, and Thebes, immured by Amphion. Amphion's towres: Now glorious Sparta lyes vpon the ground; Loftie Mycenæ hardly to be found; Of Where OEdipus raigned. OEdipus his Thebes what now remaines, Or of Of Pandion King of Athens. Pandion's Athens, but their names? Now fame reports that Rome by Troians descended from Dardanus. Dardan Sons Begins to rise, where yellow Tyber runs From fountfull A ridge of mountaines that extend through all Italy. Appennines; and there the great Foundation of so huge a fabrick seat. This therefore shall by changing propagate, And giue the World a Head. Of such a fate The Prophets haue divin'd. And this of old, As I remember, The Prophet Helenus the sonne of Priamus. Priam's Helen told To sad Æneas, of all hope forlorne, In sinking Troy's eclipse. O Æneas the sonne of Venus. Goddesse-borne, If our Apollo can presage at all; Troy, thou in safetie, shall not wholly fall. Both fire and sword shall giue thy vertue way: Flying, with thee, thou Ilium shalt convay; Vntill thou find a Land, as yet vnknowne, To Troy, and thee, more friendly then thy owne. Rome.A Citie built by Phrygians I fore-see; So great none euer was, is, or shall bee. Others shall make it great: but Augustus Cæsar, deriued by his Mother from Iulus (called else Ascanius) the sonne of Æneas. He, whose birth Springs from Iülus, Soueraigne of the Earth. He, hauing rul'd the World, shall then ascend Æthereall thrones, and Heauen shall be his end. This, I remember, with propheticke tongue, Sage Helen to divine Æneas sung. We ioy to see Rome, built by the of spring of the Troians. Pythagoras in times past hauing beene the Troian Euphorbus. our kindreds Citty grow: The Phrygians happy in their Over-throw. But least our heedlesse Steeds too farre should range From their proposed course; All suffer change: The heauens themselues, what vnder them is found; Earth, what thereon, or what is vnder ground. Wee, of the World apart, since we as well Haue Soules as Bodies, which in beasts may dwel: To those, which may our parents Soules inuest, Our brothers, dearest friends, or men at least; Let vs both safetie, and respect afford: Nor heape their bowels on Atreus feasted his brother Thycstes with the limbes of of his owne sonnes.

Let Oxen till the ground, and die with age: Let Sheepe defend thee from the winters rage: Goates bring their vdders to thy payle.

Would mine were no example to appease So sad a griefe: yet mine your griefe may ease. Hippolytvs.Perhaps y'haue heard of one Hippolytus; By Step-dames fraud, and fathers credulous Beliefe bequeath'd to death. Admire you may That I am he, if credit, what I say. Whom Phœdra formerly solicited, But vainely, to defile my fathers bed. Fearing detection, or in that refus'd; She turnes the crime, and me of her's accus'd. My father, banishing the innocent, Along with me his winged curses sent. Toward A city of Peloponesus, where Pittheus the Grandfather of Theseus by his mother Æthra once raigned, Pitthean Trœzen me my charriot bore: And driuing now by the Corinthian shore, The smooth seas swell; a monstrous billow rose, Which, rouling like a mountaine, greater growes; Then, bellowing, at the top asunder rends: When from the breach, brest high, a Bull ascends; Who at his dreadfull mouth and nosthrills spouts Part of the sea. Feare all my followers routs: But my afflicted mind was all this while Vnterrifi'd; intending my exile. When the hot horses start, erect their eares: With horror rapt, and chaced by their feares, O'r ragged rocks the totterd charriot drew: In vaine I striue their fury to subdew, The bits all frotht with fome: with all my strength Pull the stretcht raiynes, I lying at full length, Nor had their heady fright my strength o'r-gon; Had not the fervent wheele, which roules vpon The bearing Axel-tree, rusht on a stump: Which brake, and fell asunder with that iump. Throwne from my charriot, in the raignes fast-bound, My guts drag'd out aliue, my sinewes wound About the stump, my limbs in peeces hal'd; Some stuck behind, some at the charriot traild; My bones then breaking crackt, not any whole, While I exhal'd my faint and weary soule. No part of all my parts you could haue found That might be knowne: for all was but one wound. Ægeria.Now say, selfe-tortred Nymph, or can, or dare You your calamities with ours compare? I also saw those realmes, to Day vnknowne: And bath'd my wounds in smoking A burning river in Hell. Phlegeton. Had not Æsculapius. Apollos Son imploid the aid Of his great Art; I with the dead had staid. But when by potent hearbs, and Physick; of Paon an excellent Physitian. Pæons skill, I was restor'd, against sterne Plutos will: Least I, if seene, might enuie haue procur'd: Me, friendly Dizma, of Cynthus a mountaine in Delos. Cynthia with a cloud immur'd: And that, though seene, I might be hurt by none; She added age, and left my face vnknowne. Whether in Delos, doubting, or in Creet; Reiecting Creet and Delos as vnmeet, Shee plac't me here. Nor would I should retaine The memory of One by horses slaine: But said; hence forward Twice a man. Virbius be thy name That wer't Hippolytus; though thou the same. One of the Lesser Gods, here, in this Groue, I Cynthia serue; preserued by her loue. But others miseries could not abate Ægæria. Ægeria's sorrowes, nor prevent her fate. Who, couched at the bases of a hill, Thawes into teares, that streame-like ran; vntill Apollo's Sister, pittying her woes, Turn'd her t'a Spring; whose current euer flowes. The Nymphs and Hippolytus, the son of Theseus by Hippolita the Amazoni?. Amazonian this amaz'd; Tages. No lesse then when the Thuscan.

With infant lips what was but earth of late Reueal'd the Mysteries of future fate: Whom Natiues Tages calld. He first of all Th' Thuscans. Hetrurians taught to tell what would befall. Or when astonisht Romulus of old Romvlvs his Lance. Did, on Mount Palatine, his lance behold To flourish with greene leaues: the fixed foot Stood not on steele, but on a liuing root. Which, now no weapon, spreading armes displaid; And gaue admirers vnexpected shade. Or when as Cippus in the liquid glasse Cippvs. Beheld his hornes, which his beliefe surpasse. Who lifting oft his fingers to his brow, Felt what before he saw: nor longer now Condemnes his sight. Returnd with victorie; His eyes and hornes erecting to the skie: You Gods, what e'r these prodigies portend; If prosperous, he said, let them descend On Romans and on Rome: but if they be Vnfortunate, ô let them fall on me! An Altar then of liuing turf erects; The fire feeds with perfumes, pure wine iniects: And with the panting entrailes of a beast New slaine, consults; to knowe the Gods behest. This, when the Tyrrhen Augur had beheld, And saw therein endeauours that exceld, Although obscure; he from the sacrifice To Cippus hornes converts his steady eyes: Haile King, to thee, and to those hornes of thine, This place, and Rome. Latian towres, their rule resigne. Delay not; enter thou the yeelding gate: Hast, Cippus, hast: such is the Will of Fate. Thou shalt be cround a King vpon that day: And safely an eternall scepter sway. He, starting backe, from Rome diverts his face: And said; You Gods, far hence this Omen chace. Better that I in banishment grow old; Then me, a King, the The Pallace in Rome although built long after by Tarquinius Superbus, and so called of the head of a man, turned vp as they diggd the foundation. Capitoll behold. Hiding his hornes with leauie ornaments, The people and graue Senate he convents. Then mounts a Mound late by the Souldier made, And praying first (as was the custome) said Vnlesse expeld your Citty, here is One Will be your King: though not by name, yet knowne By his strange hornes. I heard the Augur say, If once in Rome, you all should him obay. He might, vnstopt, haue entred without feare: But I with-stood; though none to me more neare. Be he, Romans. Quirites, into exile sent: Or, if he merit such a punishment, Bind him in heauy chaines, and keepe him sure: Or with the Tyrants death your feares secure: The troubled people such a murmuring make; As when farre off the roring surges rake On ratling shores; or when lowd The East-wind. Eurus breakes Through tufted Pines: then one distinctly speakes In this confusion; asking, Which is he? All seeking for the hornes they could not see, Cippus repli'd; T'is I for whom you looke. Then from his head (with-held) his garland tooke; And shew'd the hornes which on his fore-head grew. Not one but sigh'd, and downe his count'nance threw: And those cleare browes (a thing beyond beliefe) Adornd with merit, they behold with griefe. Nor suffer him his honour to debace: But on his head a laurell garland place. And since he his owne entrance did with-stand: The nobles, in due fauour, so much land To Cippus gaue, as well two oxen might Round with a plough from morning vntill night. The monumentall figure of his hornes, So much admir'd, the golden Posts adornes. Æscvlapivs.Now Muses, Goddesses of Verse, relate (You know, nor yeares your memory abate) How Æsculapius in At Rome our Citty found A Temple, by circumfluent Tyber bound. A deadly plague the Latian ayre defil'd: Soules from their seats the pale disease exil'd. Wearied with funerals, when physick faild; Nor any humane industrie preuaild; They seeke cœlestiall aid. To A citty at the fotte of Parnassus supposed to stand in the midst of the Earth. Delphos sent, Built in the round Earths navell, and present Their prayers to Phœbus; that he would descend To their reliefe, and giue their woes an end. His Temple, Laurell, and his Quiuer, shake: Who thus, they trembling, from his A Trivet whereon the Pythonist sat when Apollo her mouth returned his answer. Tripod spake. What here you seeke, you neerer should haue sought: And seeke it neerer yet. Apollo ought Not now to cure you, but Æsculapius, his sonne by Coronis. Apollo's Seede. Goe with successe; and fetch my Sonne with speede. The Senate hauing heard this Oracle, The Citie search, where Phœbus sonne should dwell: The shore of Epidaure the Ogo'neus. Legate seekes: There anchoring, he intreats th'assembled Greekes To send their God: who might th' Ausonian State To health restore; and vrg'd the Apollos Oracle. charge of Fate. They varie in opinion, some assent To send this succour; many, not content To loose their owne in giuing others aid, Striue to retaine him, and the rest disswade. While thus they doubt, the Day declin'd his Light: And Earth-borne shadowes cloth'd the world in Night. See the Comment.Th'Health-giuing God, in sleepe, appeares to stand As in his Fane; a staffe in his left hand: And stroking with his right his reuerend beard; From his hope-rendring brest these words were heard. Feare not, I come; my shape I will forsake: View, and mark well this staffe-infolding Snake: Such will I seeme, yet shew of greater size; So great as may a Deitie comprize. He with the Voice, with him and Voice away Sleepe flew: fled Sleepe persude by chearefull Day. The starres now vanquisht by the mornings flame; The doubtfull Of Epidaurus. Nobles to the temple came, Intreat him by cœlestiall signes to shew Whether he were content to stay or goe. This hardly said, the God in Serpents shroud, His high crest gold-like glistring, hist aloud. His statue, altar, gates, the marble flore, And golden roofe, shooke at th'approching Powre He, in his Fane, brest-high his bodie rais'd: Rouling about his eyes that flame-like blaz'd. All tremble. The chast Priest, his tresses ty'd With sacred fillet, knew the God, and cry'd 'Tis he! 'tis he! all you who present are Pray with your hearts and tongues: ô heauenly-Faire, Propitious proue to those who thee implore! All that were there the present Powre adore; Reiterating what the Priest had said: With heart and tongue the Romans also prayd. He, by the motion of his lofty crest, And doubled hisses, signe's to their request. Then sliding downe the polisht staires, his looke Reuerts on his old altars; now forsooke: Salutes his shrine, and Temple deckt with towres.

Cæsar Augustus. His name great Heire Alone his Load shall beare: and strongly shall By our conduct revenge his fathers fall. By his good fortune In this I have not precisely rendred the words of the Author but folowed the history For Antonius hauing beseeged Decrus Brutus in Mutina. Augustus by the command of the Senat raised the siege with the overthrow of Antony. Mutina shall owe To him her peace: Pharsalian fields shall flow With blood; A citty in Thessaly where he overthrew Brutus &amp; Cassius, and nere where Iulius had formerly vanquished Pompey blood twice Philippi shall imbrue: On red Sicilian Seas he shall subdue Sextus Pompeius, the son of Pompey the Great, vanquished in a Naval fight not farre from Sicilia.A mighty name. Cleopatra, who had married Marcus Antonius; their vnited forces overthrowne by Augustus at Action. Th' Ægyptian Spouse shall fall, Ill trusting to her Roman Generall: To make our stately The principall pallace in Rome. Capitoll obay Her proud A Citty in Ægypt famous for luxury. Canopus, shall in vaine assay. What need I of those barbarous people tell, And Nations, which by either Ocean dwell? He shall the habitable Earth command; And stretch his Empire ouer sea and land. Peace giuen to Earth; he shall conuert his care To ciuill Rule, iust Lawes; and by his faire Example Vertue guide. Then looking to The future times; and Nephewes to ensue; A Tiberius, the son of Livia his wife by her former husband the adopted Heire of his name and Empire. Sonne shall blesse him from a holy womb: To him he shall resigne his name, and roome. Nor shall, till full of age, ascend th' aboads Of heauenly Dwellers, and Romulus, and Iulius. his kindred Gods. Meane-while from this slaine corps his soule convay Vp to the starres, and giue it a cleare Ray: That Iulius may with friendly influence Shine on our Capitol and Court from thence. This said: invisible faire Venus stood Amid the Senate; from his corps, with blood Defil'd, her Cæsars new-fled spirit bare To heauen, not suffer'd to resolue to aire. And, as in her soft bosome borne, she might Perceiue it take a Powre, and gather light. When once let loose, It forth-with vp-ward flew; And after it long blazing tresses drew. The radiant Starre his Sonnes great acts beheld. Out-shining his: and ioy'd, to be exceld. Though he would haue his Fathers deeds preferd Befor his owne: yet free-tongu'd Fame deter'd By no commandment, yeelds th' avoided Bayes To his cleare browes; and but in this gaine-sayes. So Atreus yeelds to Agamemnons fame; Ægeus so to Theseus: Peleus name Stoops to Achilles. That I may confer Th'illustrious to their equals, Iupiter So Saturne tops. Ioue rules the arched skie, And triple world; the Earths vast Monarchie T' Augustus bowes: both Fathers, and both sway. You Gods, Whose Images he brought with him from Troy. Æneas guids, who made your way Through fire and sword; Æneas. you Gods of men become; Romulus. Quirinus, Father of triumphant Rome; Thou Mars, invincible Quirinus Sire; Chast Vesta, with thy euer-burning fire, Vesta had her chappell in his Pallace, &amp; Phœbus a magnificent Temple of his owne erecting.Among Great Cæsars Houshold-Gods inshrin'd; Domestick Phœbus, with his Vesta ioyn'd; Thou Ioue Iupiter Capitolinus; his Temple adioyning to the Capitol, called Tarpeia, of her who betrayed that place to the Sabines. whom in Tarpeian towres we adore; And You, all You, whom Poets may implore: Slow be that day, and after I am dead, Wherein Augustus, of the world the Head, Leauing the Earth, shall vnto heauen repaire; Yea in his life time hee suffered himselfe to bee adored for a God; nor restrained the erecting of Temples to his honour.And fauour those that seeke to him by prayer. And now the worke is ended, which, Ioue's rage, Nor fire, nor Sword shall raze, nor eating Age. Come when it will my deaths vncertaine howre; Which of this body only hath a powre: Yet shall my better part transcend the skie; And my immortall name shall neuer die. For, where-so-ere the Roman Their ensignes borne on the tops of speares. Eagles spread Their conquering wings, I shall of all be read: And, if we Poets true presages giue, I, in my Fame eternally shall liue.</field>
