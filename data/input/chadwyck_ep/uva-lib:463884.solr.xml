      <field name="fulltext">TO The Right HONOURABLE The Lord ROSSE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his learned Friend M?. THOMAS BANCROFT, ON HIS POEM Entituled THE Heroicall Lover. From your retir'd abode in Bradley town, Welcome, my friend, abroad to fair renown. Nova Atlantis and Eutopia you Again expose unto the publique view By your heroick Piece; unknown before T' all mankind save to Bacon and to More. To the tripartite world Columbus erst The westerne India did discover first, Yet (after that his perfecter survey) Vesputius much on's glory tooke away, By giving it his name: so though those two Most learned Lords did first those countryes shew, Yet by your Antheon (and his fair Delight) Farre-sought Fidelta, does your skill unite Eutopia and Atlantis: what these two Ow'd singly to their pen, they both owe you. Nor Belgium, Italy, nor France, nor Spain, Nor Græcia, nor Sicilia, could constrain (With their most tempting objects) your brave Knight To yield submission to a false delight. Although Sir Antheon did refrain to run The monstrous courses of the Knight o'th' Sun, (Whose Fablers so strange tales of him reherse, That such untruths never appear'd in verse) Those countryes Beauties he despis'd and pelfe; Some others do orecome, but he himself: And of all victories it is the best, To keep our own wild appetites represt: Hereby his prowesse he did most discover, And hence you terme him the Heroick Lover. Your faire Fidelta did not range about Eutopian cities to find Suitors out: A free well-order'd house she kept; and there Sir Antheon found her out, and married her. Joy or long life I need not wish them either; They in your lines shall happy live for ever: And you for penning their high Epick song (With Laurel crown'd) shall live i'th' Poets throng. Aston Cokaine Bart. Upon M?. Bancrofts POEM, THE HEROICAL LOVER. VVho're bound to th' true Atlantis, cannot fail If by your Kinsmans &amp; your Charts they sail 'Tis by these means we really descry What's in Sir Francis but Sciograpy. Your neighbour hills in joyful ecchoes tell 'Tis Haddon where those happy Parents dwell That nurst Sir Antheon; and time will discover Th' illustrious Rose (Sir) your Heroick Lover. There, there live sweetly wedded Great and Good, The brave Supporters of illustrious blood, Whose waiters shew you by their courteous eye The King and Queen of hospitality. From this brave Paire Sir Antheon tooke his Armes Proofe 'gainst Aselgia's and Sordezza's charmes; Whose generous temper, extract with his birth, Shall scorne and discipline those sonnes of earth, Whose brutish valour wine and sloth would rust, But for caprichioes, rapine, pride, and lust; Whilst injur'd vertue, honour, longing stand To see their triumph purchas'd by his hand. Your Lovers (might I venture at your skill) Are that, Melentus; this, a Claracil: Or if I miss in one, I have descry'd At least th' Propheticke of the reall Bride. For our Atlantis truly doth afford A race of young Fidelta's, but one Lord, The brave Sir Antheon, whose illustrious fame Eutopia shall translate b'y another name To stately Belvoir, where his gallant story Shall out-doe all that Fame has yet of glory. Me thinkes I see approch a glorious dawn, When all the ferall birds and beasts withdrawn To the darke cavernes of eternall night, From this blest region forc't to take their flight, Shall give admission to the Prince of day In a triumphant chariot drawn this way, Welcom'd with thousand Graces, waited on To faire Fidelta and Sir Antheon. Our floting Delos fixt, then men shall say Haddon's Atlantis, Belvoir Eutopia; And then your Muse, crown'd with deserved Bayes, Shall sing of Epithl'mes and Halcyon dayes. Anth. Harwood. THE HEROICAL LOVER Canto I. The Argument. Of honour'd parents Antheon bred, And in green years well seasoned, Is loth his lineage to belie, But aimes at true nobility. Great Fate, that at a kingdome here did throw The chance of war, afflicts us still with woe; Yet some impulsion stirres me up to sing: Daigne me, ye Muses, from your purest spring. A flow of bounty, that my tongue may be Sweetly embath'd, and sound true harmony. In new Atlantis, Charidem, and fair Olympia lately dwelt a noble pair, Warm'd with a love as equal as the heat That Chymists use th' Elixar to beget. The bright Celestials slide not from the skies More calmely, to perform their embassies, Than these went through all passages of life, At no time troubled with domestick strife. Wealth flow'd upon them like a high Spring-tide, Yet neither by intemperance nor pride (Vices that on great fortunes most attend) 'Gainst well-known morals did they much offend. They oft reflected on this humble sphere, Whence their frail mortal parts desumed were; Yet minding that their soules to heavenly fires Were near ally'd, they scorn'd all base desires. A Son they had (the tender fruit of love) Whom sith propitious Planets, Sol and Iove, Welcom'd into the world; some Artists, wel Taught by clear Heaven dark matters to fore-tel; (As formerly the Delphick God had from His golden Tripod utter'd things to come) Were askt what fortunes should the child betide In course of years: whereto it was reply'd, ‘That as he was illustrious by descent, ‘So for his acts he should be eminent, ‘Should seek as treasure fair Fidelta's love, ‘And richly blest in its fruition prove. Now, as when Philip saw his son bestride Bucephalus, he was so highly joy'd, That his dilated spirits down his face Made tears to run, as each did other chase: So were the Parents of young Antheon (so Their son they cal'd) most joyful to fore-know That bravely he to Honour should aspire, And crown with rich content his high desire. 'Twas their first care to have his body strong And solid, able to endure each wrong Of wind and weather. But when time (that mends As wel as marrs, and by concoction spends The drowsy humours in an Infants brain) His wits had waken'd, and laid things more plain Before his sight, that well he might discern Proposed objects, and their nature learn; They with sweet easie precepts well did fit His tender age, and then the same commit To learned Worthies, men that did as wel In vertues, as in sciences, excel, These much admir'd his forward industry. And as when in the years minority Young goodly Plants with smiling blossoms shine, We of their fruitfulness may well divine: So did these sonnes of wisdome boldly guess He would grow famous by his forwardness, And that such sparks of excellence would fly Up to a pitch of rare sublimity. Of these he learn'd exotick languages, Such as conduc'd to nobler knowledges Of liberal arts, religion, manners, and The lawes and customes of each famous land. As his wit was to admiration prompt, So was his language elegant and compt Beyond compare; and well he could bestick His sentences with flowers of Rhetorick. Nile, that with sev'n mouths runnes into the Main, Seems not more fluent than his happy strain Of elocution was; his hands and eyes Being order'd with his voice to harmonize: Nor can strong Neptune with his trident raise His waters sooner, or their wrath appease, Than he could by his Oratory sway Mens hearts, and turn them this or th'other way. But when to nobler verse he did erect His spirits, O what curious and select Phrases came melting from his sugred pen, Able to soften marble-breasted men, Or harder-hearted women! nere could he Endure to blast his leaves with ribauldry, Or stoop to baseness; but still high and clear (As Phœbus sonne beseem'd) his phansies were: T'honour and vertue did he still direct His aimes, and on such sacred things reflect, As Orpheus thought on in his ravisht state, When he with hymnes the Gods did celebrate. What ere's compris'd in Natures history, Was the discourse of his Philosophy; Who was not ignorant what spirit blowes The worlds main Organ, most harmonious; What principles do constitute the same; Nor what proportion in the wondrous frame One to another holds; nor yet how great War they maintain, where concord keeps her seat. Of what the gazing multitude admir'd He learn'd the causes, and thereof desir'd So clear a knowledge, that he did despise The trifling term of obscure qualities. All sorts of Meteors, whether high or low, With their imperfect mixtures, did he know. He found that subterranean winds do make (For false imprisonment) the earth to quake. He well could tell what strength of cold converts Water to Hail; and that the frothier sorts Of vapours, from the aires cold middle-roome Do in thin flakes of Snow (thick-scatter'd) come, Whose dissolution mirthful plenty brings; And these the feathers are of Boreas wings. He knew what smoky exhalations roll'd Up into aire, and there begert with cold, And chaf't into a flame, do roar and crack, As Heaven had broke the Giant Atlas back. He knew what those that kept the Heavens highway By contemplation did of Comets say; What copious fumes, when many mon'ths they hung Ore a sad kingdome, fewell'd them so long; After what Planets course they most did bend Their motions, and what fates they did portend. He knew the Globe celestial, Parallels, Colures, Meridians, and all circles else; Could into several coasts the Heavens divide, Had learn'd what circuits the fair starrs do ride, With all that to their influence belongs, As he had heard divine Iopas songs. But more familiarly this Globe below, With all its Zones and Climates, did he know; How broad a liquid girdle (here and there Embost with Islands) girts the solid sphere; And how the shore's indented more or less With Promontories, Creeks, and Isthmuses. He knew all watery wonders, and could tell How humorous Luna makes the Ocean swel; And how it sinkes again; as persons high And proud, are apt to fall from dignity. No Mariner that dwells upon the Flood, The use of Chart or compass understood More perfectly than he, nor dar'd profess More knowledge of all famous voyages. Well vers't he was (affecting to be wise At others charge) in best of histories, And as an Indian upon Ganges shore 'Mongst common pibbles pickes up golden ore, So amongst obvious passages what he Worth observation found, he faithfully Entreasur'd in his mind, and so indear'd That to his use which he of others heard. But when he met with actions brave and great, Such as enforc't proud fame on them to wait, O then he seem'd to feel a secret fire Boiling his blood, and raising a desire To match th' atchievements were they nere so high, And pass the low marks of mortality! He had more skill to hit than mind to hurt, And us'd his sword but in a way of sport, Yet durst the stoutest Combatants oppose, And could make down-right payment with his blowes; But in the dusty field of Mars he chose Rather to chafe his blood, and could dispose An army (as his best advantage lay) In all the several formes of battel-ray, And quickly change them, as from circular To Oval, Cuneate, or Quadrangular. He knew when to go on, and when retreat; How a besieged town to win, and beat An enemy out of his fortress; he Could use all Engines made for battery; Could work a Mine under a Castle-wall, And make it with more noise than thunder fall; Could fortifie a Hold, make sure defence With all sorts of securing Muniments, As knowing what to Palisadoes, strong Ensconcing, and entrenchments did belong. One would have judg'd him o'th' Thessalian breed By's horsemanship; who, on his generous Steed Mounted, and raising dust with motion proud, Look'd like a Centaure phansied in a cloud. He could his courage raise, his force command, Cause him in full career to make a stand, T' obey his least directions, every way To turne, curvet, and lusty gambols play. But as a weak child roming here and there In a large garden, plucks some flowers near In trifling sort, but balketh more, that are Perhaps more sweet, more beautiful and rare So on his meaner ornaments I yet Lay hold, but things more laudable omit; As that (which is of knowledges the best) He knew great Natures Parent (who imprest His image upon man,) and likewise knew What tribute's to his Soveraigne goodness due. Should relate how well acquainted he With his own essence was, how far could see Into his frame, his temperament, and all His bloods impulsions, which we Passions call: How far he div'd into th' abstrusity O'th' Soul, and after how much industry He found her seat imperial, her extent Of pow'r, and wondrous forme of government. He took delight with judgement to reflect Upon his own far-piercing Intellect, To regulate its acts, and teach his Will To yield obedience to its dictates still. Hence famous for his wisdome he became; And justly, sith enlightned by the same All vertues are, which in his gentle breast Meeting, with much content their centre blest. Such was his valour, that he knew not how To fear invasive danger, not to bow Under afflictions weight, but upright stood With heart unconquer'd and unchilled blood. In the foul gulfs of luxury he nere Emplunged himself, but a fair course did steere In Seas of plenty: and what ere he took In hand, did fixtly at fair justice look; Nor (so much as his Poniards breadth) would pass Beyond the way that right and level was. His courteous sweetness humbly seem'd to show That from high Ancestry his blood did flow: His bounty (free as heavenly influence) Made good the style of brave magnificence: And all his vertues were wrought up so high, So full of lustre, strength, and dignity, That nothing could be added save the sound Of mighty Fame to make them more renown'd. Canto 2. The Argument. The young Knight of Fidelta hears, And thinks her praises tune the spheres; Seeks her through Italy in vaine, But finds Aselgia with her train. When at the beam of youth this matchless Knight Now weigh'd himself, &amp; found his spirits light, And felt more fervent blood, he thought to prove The sweet endearements of desertful love, And call'd to mind what Beauty he had seen Fit to be took for his affections Queen, As minded some brave Heroine to wed, Or never else to warm a Genial bed. Meanwhile comes Fame (than thinnest fume more light, Or wings of insects shining in their flight) And tells him in a busy panting hast Of a renowned Lady, richly grac't With all endowments Nature can bestow, By name Fidelta; who her self would show Most worthy of his love, although it were A treasure of affection nere so dear; But was so wondrous modest, so retir'd, So sweetly humble, that she much desir'd Her beauties, though as sparks of heaven beheld, Might yet encloud their beams, and be conceal'd; So much her precious vertue fear'd to be Allaid by th' mixture of much company: And for this reason (as some birds do flit From coast to coast) she did so often quit The place she honour'd, from resort to go, That where to find her very few did know. ‘As sure now, said Sir Antheon, as I draw ‘A trusty sword, I such a Lady saw ‘In my last dream; who having at me cast ‘Some smiling glances, vanisht at the last, ‘And left my heart on fire; t'is surely she ‘That must be mine by Destinies decree. ‘This to confirme, I now remember well ‘What oft to me my chary Nurse did tell, ‘To wit, that great Astrologers once said, ‘That I a Lady of this name should wed. ‘I'le travel through this Globe to seek her out ‘Where'ere she hidden lyes, and should not doubt ‘But to discloud her, though her beauty bright ‘Were maskt in shadowes of Cimmerian night. ‘The Stygian Prince that Proserpine did steale, ‘Should not this Lady from my sight conceal ‘In's inmost cell, though it with clouds were hung, ‘And 'bout her bed redoubled darkness flung; ‘But with a deep device I would orethrow ‘His shady palace, and her beauties show ‘To th' upper world, that would admiring stand, ‘And offer service what she should command. This said, he call'd for gentle Eubulus, A man mature, discreet, and vertuous, And thus bespake him: Friend, I now must try ‘The strength and temper of your amity ‘So long profest: by all fair promises ‘Of friendly aide, all vowes of services ‘Heated with zeale (and yet I know your heart's ‘So firme, that needless are perswasive arts) ‘I must intreat you readily to goe ‘With me, and help my skilless youth to wooe; ‘For I must travel (who cantell how farre?) ‘To seek a bright, though sublunary, starre; ‘A Lady whom all beauty doth embeam, ‘Though never by me seene save in a dream: ‘But so we do adore the Powers on high, ‘Though not expos'd to view of mortal eye; ‘And we admire the Phœnix, though there be ‘Few that did ere that winged wonder see. ‘The place of her retirement I no more ‘Know, then I do the Oceans utmost shore; ‘Yet shall I finde her to my wisht content ‘(My Genius tells me so) if you'l assent ‘To my desires, and cause my paines to be ‘More short through your long-lov'd society. ‘To make a question, Eubulus reply'd, ‘Of service, is to make our friendship void, ‘As cancell'd were its bond: command me t'go ‘On bare feet through the Hyperborean snow, ‘Or through dry parched Desarts seek my way ‘'Mongst poisonous Serpents; and without delay ‘I'le run those hazards: the sweet style of Friend ‘Is charme enough to cause me to attend ‘Your motions through the world, and to despise ‘The frowns of Fortune, strokes of Destinies. These words made musick in Sr. Antheons eare, Who for th' affection he profest to beare, Return'd him thanks, and further did devise How to atchive his amorous enterprize. But as a Sea-man ready to launch out O'th' Harbour, when the winds do shift about From point to point, well knows not how to set His hoised sailes that he may forward get: So did this noble Lover doubtful stand Whither he should direct his course, what land He should fill with his fame, what region see, To make therein blind loves discovery. But having heard how Italy was grac't Sometime with Ladyes of renown, as chast Lucretia, Arria, and Paulina deare To Seneca, he now resolv'd to steere A straight course thither, hoping there to find Fidelta, th' honour of all woman-kinde; And to observe with some delight what breed Of beauties now those Ladyes did succeed. So, like the Trojan Knight, attended by Faithful Achates, full of hope and joy, Went he with Eubulus by land and Sea, Justled with rocky dangers in his way, And at a hard rate did experience buy, Yet came at last in ken of Italy. And saw the smoke of Rhegium, where t'is said That famous land was sometime severed From Sicily, the force of waves and wind Driving asunder what had been joyn'd. Having arriv'd where Harbour did invite, And chear'd his worthy friend, his dear delight, Of that fair coast a greedy view he tooke, More pleas'd therewith than Jason was to looke On Colchis strand: th' one for a golden fleece Sail'd farre, this other a farre richer piece Of beauty sought. Like Mercury he mov'd, And truth of history by tryal prov'd, Apt to take notice and to give account Of every wood and river, Plaine and Mount In the whole region. One day as he came Near to Vesuvius, when it belcht a flame Out of its horrid mouth, and sent a smoke Therewith that threatned half the world to choke, ‘O Hell, said he, thy happiness is great, ‘That hast no feeling of that fervent heat ‘Within thy bowells, nor art rapt along ‘By force thereof, but restest on a strong ‘And fixed Base; whereas in my sick heart ‘(That seemes at every sigh to lose some part ‘Of its vitality) a heat I feele ‘Able to melt a very breast of Steel, ‘By whose impulsion am I mov'd to goe ‘From coast to coast in hope to lose my woe, ‘And now could wish I here might rest my head, ‘And sleep my last in learned Plinies bed. Thus let he forth a Lovers discontent, Yet with affections more inflamed went To gallant Naples, and to Millaine great, Faire Florence, and high Rome (an Empires seat,) Rich Venice, and to many Cities more, More populous now, more famous heretofore: And wheresoere he came, he still enquir'd For that hid star whose sight he most desir'd; Yet nothing heard in answer, save that she (Affecting sights of fam'd Antiquity) Came once to Rome, but thence ere long withdrew Her honour'd presence, whither no man knew. This news that like a bitter-sweet did tast, Caus'd him to double his industrious hast In his research: when passing on the way Through the fresh fields of rich Campania, Whose pleasures once their sinews all unstrung, That marcht with warlike Hannibal along To Capua; some Rusticks (fit to sort With sheep, and with rude Sylvanes to disport) Bluntly inform'd him that a Lady gay, Who in that region bare a Queen-like sway, And courted was by braver men than swaines, Did adde much sweetness to their flowery Plains On the green Margin of a chrystal lake Stood her more shining house, built high to take Far-distant eyes; about it Myrtle-groves And bowers did emblemize more pleasant loves; In mystique beds (all fair and odorous As Flora's bosome) glow'd the Paphian Rose 'Mongst flaming Heliotropes, whilst violets blew And star-like Lillies heavens fair figure drew. There planted was rich store of bounteous vines, That swell'd her Cellars with Nectarean wines; There fields seem'd Seas of plenty, and did wave With corne, as much as greedy Hinds could crave; There goodliest cattel graz'd; and all things else Were such as few could find their Parallels. Thither the Knight (with hope of sweet content Drawn eas'ly on) his course directly bent; And when he now approching was espy'd, The Lady all her magnetismes emploid More to attract him; rich perfumes were made; On loud-sweet Instruments her Vassalls plaid, Wherewith the heightned water in its fall Kept time, with purlings rarely musical; Thereto encaged birds sang many a Lay, And all those soft aires Echo home did play; So that as winds the water did advance In waves, the Lake seem'd all the while to dance. Charm'd by those raptures, softly rode the Knight By the Lakes side, remotely opposite To that fair tower; when now the Lady laid Her beauties forth, her braveries displaid At a large window, beckon'd him, and sent Glances and smiles, and signes of kindness meant. He bowing with much courtesy, kept on His way, intending (when he had anon Past by that wat'ry obstacle) to make Some courtship to that Lady of the Lake. But not much farther had he forward gone, Than valiant Hector could that flint have thrown That hit strong Ajax, when he chanc't to see A grave man under a green leavy tree, With book in hand, and eyes thereon so set, As all his wealth lay in that Cabinet: Yet seem'd his garb and garments to proclaim That of some honour'd family he came; And in his countenance there something shin'd, That shewd the precious habits in his mind. The jolly Knight, desiring much to know Whether the Lake was fordable or no, Went and requir'd of him; who thus reply'd: ‘Sir, be assur'd this is the safer side; ‘And if you'll calmely hear, (because I see ‘In you some sparks of nobler gallantry) ‘I'le tell you why: At th' house (whereto I guess ‘You mean to go) lives that grand Sorceress, ‘Wicked Aselgia; who on Roses treads, ‘Paints her alluring parts, perfumes her beds, ‘And feasts blind Lovers, that they likewise may ‘Feed her wild lusts, and so themselves betray ‘To ruine. Some of them (as Apes their young ‘She with embracing kills; and then they're flung ‘Into this fatal water which you see, ‘Being therefore call'd The Lake of Luxury: ‘Others she clothes in pide and ragged coates. ‘And some transformes to Satyres, Monkies, Goates ‘Or viler beasts: who ere endears her vice, ‘A Serpent finds in stead of Paradise. ‘Her damned witcheries are fed at once ‘With blood of men, and marrow of their bones, ‘Their entrailes, and the humours of their eyes, ‘Besides the spoile of mental faculties: ‘And if she draw not Luna to the ground ‘Medea-like; yet still is Venus found ‘In her unhollowed roomes, as onely there ‘She meant to dwell, and leave her giddy sphere. ‘Her musicke's magical, and poisons fly ‘In the hot streame of her perfumes, whereby ‘She drawes delightfully soft-natur'd men ‘T' her Mansion; whence, as from the Lions den, ‘None are trac't back; at least, if any be, ‘'Tis not without some markes of misery. ‘Braz'd Impudence sits staring at her gates, ‘And rude Procacity upon her waites: ‘Intemp'rance ushers her, and in her house ‘All lewd disorders keep their rendevouz. ‘Avoid her, gentle Sir, as you would fly ‘From a dire Basiliske with death in's eye, ‘Or plague more deadly; and hereafter say ‘You met with wholesome counsel in your way. The Knight exprest much thankefulness, and would (Had need requir'd) have guerdon'd him with gold For better-worth intelligence; whereby (Being angry at his own credulity) He was induc'd his purpose and his way To alter, and new fortunes to assay. Canto III. The Argument. The Knight, that in Italian ground No footsteps of Fidelta found, Travells int' France, with Robbers fights, And Alazonia's profers slights. By this time had our noble Traveller (Fitted no less for Mars than Cupids warre) Marcht through fam'd Italy, and as that Hun, Stout Attyla, who did that land ore-run, In every town and city sought for prey: So had this VVorthy (if compare I may Vertue with vice) in every place enquir'd For that faire Prize which chiefely he desi'rd. But being not found, (as who can set the time Wherein he shall to high contentment climbe?) He elsewhere laid the Scene of his designe, To wit, in France; whose people are (like wine) So brisk and pleasant, that great Cæsar might In their harmonious tempers well delight; And haply for that cause he longer staid Amongst them, and their country more surveid. Over the huge high-shoulder'd Alps there be Three passages 'twixt France and Italy; One of them Hannibal is said t' have wrought With fire and vinegar, what time he brought The Fates 'gainst Rome: that way Sir Antheon chose; And as with Eubulus he climbing goes, Bespeakes him thus: Sweet Partner of my care, ‘Whose spirits with no dangers daunted are, ‘Nor any paines decline, I hope we shall ‘Much sooner pass these hills than Hannibal; ‘The way's well smooth'd, &amp; fire my bosome bears ‘That melts my brain into a lake of teares, ‘As piercing as the liquor that he pour'd ‘Upon the rocks; though yet the Heavens nere lowr'd ‘Upon our travells, but anon they clear'd Their lookes, and full of smiling light appear'd. ‘He, full of falshood, cruelty, despight, ‘And all the Furies that enrage a fight, ‘Could scarcely promise to himself success ‘Like my fair hopes, who Love and Nobleness ‘Strive to advance, and nothing seek but what ‘Fore-pointing Fates have taught me t' levell at, Five times had Phœbus with his golden light The world immantled, and as oft the Night The same had disarraid, before those vast And rocky hills the Knight had over-past: But lastly coming where the country lay More plain, he took much pleasure to survey The fruitful land, and bent his industry To compass't round, though in the forme it lye Of a Quadrangle; as he meant to make (VVhat greatest Artists scarce dare undertake) A Circle and a Quadrat to agree In the nice point of just equality. Blith Tityrus, that well could pipe and sing, Made not the fields of Amaryllis ring More fully, than this worthy Lover spred Fidelta's fame wheres'ere he travelled: Nor did pale Ceres with more industry Her daughter seek in fields of Sicily; Nor Cadmus, at his fathers first Command, Make a more busy search by Sea and land For rap't Europa, than this Gallant did Wher'ere he deem'd his Treasure might lye hid; Which could he by good fortune find, he would Not envy Plutus for his heapes of gold. About the country he not only drew A journal-line, but did his quest pursue Through all its provinces, wheres'ere they lay: And being not farre from Poictiers on his way, Found an occasion not ably to show What fiery fortitude in's breast did glow. It thus befell: Two Gallants that had bin Gaming all night, and paid so dear for sin, That they had lost their Pictures at their play, Nor left a Crosse to keep the Fiend away, Next morning (though o're night dejected low) VVell mounted, to their high-way trade did go, To try what fortunes they could steale upon, And so patch up their poor condition. But as a sharpe-set Haggard that did faile To find a Patridge, or a daintier Quaile. Flyes at less Game, a Linnet or a Wren: So these, not meeting with well-monyed men, Fell foule an two fair Milk-maids (as they sat Sweetning their paines with songs and pleasant chat) Seis'd on their little hardly-earned store Of coine, and made them desperately poor; Causing the wretches in a wild affright To cry for succour to th' approching Knight, Whom through some shadowy bushes they espy'd Full of clear-metal'd gallantry to ride: Forthwith he came like Perseus, when he saw Andromeda enchain'd, in rage did draw Upon the Robbers; who again made head, Saluted him with sounding blowes instead Of a Good-morrow; fiercely fought, yet straight Feeling upon their crests th' unwonted weight Of his stiff blade, their own on ground they threw, Yielded themselves, and did for Quarter sue. ‘Quarter? said he, you hateful Plunderers ‘Of purses! Terrours of faint Travellers! ‘Can you expect kind Quarter, that should be ‘Tortur'd and quarter'd for your villany? ‘Can you (the wandering fires of wickedness, ‘Your countryes running Plague-sores) that profess ‘Nothing but riots, rapines, cruel acts, ‘Have ought in minde save Gallowses and Racks? ‘You in rich Scarlet like to Princes goe, ‘Yet base as tatter'd Rogues your selves do show ‘By your debauchments, and extinguish quite ‘All sparks of worth that shines in others bright. ‘Come, Milk-sops, that, as you could slash and slay ‘Whole troops, would seem, yet straight the Pultrons play, ‘Cast now those splendid Sloughs, that ill become ‘Such Snakes: for as you took their monyes from ‘These Maids, their garments shal you have, put on ‘Their Aprons &amp; their wastcoates: they shall d'on Your cloakes, and say they never were so brave, ‘Nor the like gallant day shall ever have. ‘Take their pailes too, &amp; carry them to th' Town ‘Meekely and maidenly; nor do you frown, ‘Much less refuse, lest that my sword t' a goade ‘I turne, and shrewdly prick you on the Rode: ‘I never drove such Bullocks; nor will I ‘Sell them, unlesse the Hangman come to buy. This said, he set them marching on the way (Not as in battaile, but) in strange array. The Varlets sowrely lookt, and ready were To turne to curds the milk that they did beare: But the Maids were lighthearted, talkt aloud, Smil'd at their robes &amp; thought they seem'd too proud When now they came to Poictieres, nere did Fowls So flock at mid-day about flying Owles, As people swarming came in such amaze, Upon those walking wonderments to gaze: And all that viewed them did so break out Into loud laughter, clap their hands, and shout, That never could a more confused noise Be rais'd at Bacchus wild solemnities. Scarce could Sir Antheon and his friend make way With flourisht weapons, that they might convey Their theevish Charge t' an aweful Magistrate, Who to their vile offence might adequate Some punishment: yet, cleaving still the Throng, To a strict Justicer they came ere long, Who thought th' Offenders not unfit to feele (Sith cladlike women) what belong'd to th' wheel, That as to break good fortunes they were bent, They suffer might a breaking punishment: Mean while he sent them where expect they might After a law-day a long-lasting night. Fame with a fuller blast did never strain Her cheeks, when Theseus had Procrustes slain, Than now proclaim'd Sir Antheons worth, most high In honour, courted, feasted royally. Yet' cause Fidelta's image ever shin'd In's phansy, small content he there could find. But (hearing least of her he most did love) Resolv'd forthwith some other aires to prove; And first to visit Europes thorough-fare, Full-peopled Paris, did himself prepare. When he did nearer to that City come Than Tullies Tusculanum is to Rome, Just in that season when with eager pace Flame-breathing Sirius did the Lion chace, Under a tree whose umbrage did invite His stay, he from his Palfrey did alight, Intending there the sunnes exalted pow'r T'avoid, and rest until the Evening hour: The fervour of the day began t'abate By slow degrees, when in great pomp and state A Court-bred Lady that way chanc't to come, Drawn by six Horses (whiter than their fome) In a rich chariot, such as might compare With Cytharea's, which through yielding air Soft Swannes convey. The Lady seem'd of light And air made up, her presence was so bright: Yet some dark spots she on her face did wear, That haply she like Cinthia might appear. Her head with Chrysolithes adorned round, Seem'd with a radiant starry cincture crown'd: Her Carcanet and bracelets would have made A richer chain than ever Vulcan laid Upon his Anvil: of pure Tyrian die Her vesture was, which fine embroydery Had deckt with Peacocks, wondrous (to behold) For lively workmanship, and all of gold, Save that round Saphires, colour'd like the skies, Did shine in stead of Argus watchful eyes. Sir Antheon seeing her so stately brave, Upon her fixt his eyes; who gladly gave Him a full view as leisurely she past Along, her pleasure not requiring hast; For onely t'view the country, and to shew Her pompous greatness, she abroad did goe. Somewhat behind the Traine that with her came, On a mishapen Jade, both lean and lame, Rode as forelorn a person all along, Grumbling &amp; rolling his distemper'd tongue His clothes had been like flow'rs, but now were grown Poor wither'd weeds; and looking oft thereon, Sorely he sighed, and his browes did knit, As one both weak in fortune and in wit: Of him the Knight enquir'd what Lady 'twas That in illustrious state that way did pass, Like some great Princess. Sir, said he (to tell ‘The truth) this Lady do I know too well; ‘Her name is Alazonia, high at Court ‘Has she been bred, but who fares better for't? ‘I've serv'd her almost as old Poets say ‘Hard-taskt Alcides did Queen Omphale; ‘A fair thred have I spun, spent many pounds, ‘Consum'd my patrimony, sold whole townes ‘To buy her love; who mounts of gold to me ‘Promis'd, though not a Mole-hil do I see ‘Of kind performance. Yet as one bewitcht, ‘Or for true service sure to be enricht, ‘I still wait on her; though I may as soon ‘Vault from this Centre to the silver Moon, ‘And bring down treasure, as her love regain, ‘Who now beholds her servant with disdain; ‘Much less recover what I erst have lost ‘Through fond profusion, and excessive cost. ‘For though I now attend in mean array, ‘Yet have I serv'd her when I shone like Day, ‘Was the Top-gallant of the Town, and gave ‘Lawes (as it were) to all that would be brave. ‘Such must they be that on this Lady wait, ‘Who studies most quaint fashions to create, ‘And boasts more in an hour, than in an age ‘She will make good, howere she does engage. More had he utter'd in that eager vein, But that the Lady bad drive back again: For she descrying, as she passed by, In the young Knight some sparks of gallantry, Felt her affection (kindled thence) to glow With such an ardour, that she needs must go Back to th'attractive object of her love, And with these melting words his metal prove: ‘Sir, if enfeebling heat, or redious length ‘Of travel, chance t' have tired out your strength, ‘Rest in your servants chariot here; lo I ‘Dispread mine armes t' imbrace your company, ‘And shall (as with a bowl of Nectar deep) ‘Waken your spirits, lay your cares asleep. ‘In those bright eyes I something read above ‘Th'ascent and region of a common love; ‘And that I might with fuller view discern ‘What warm'd my heart, I made this quick return. ‘Where ever you intend your worth to show, ‘Your pleasure I'le attend, and with you go: ‘And if at Court (a Stage for you most fit) ‘You will keep up your fashion and your wit, ‘I'le see your way to lofty honour clear'd, ‘Nor leave you till in happiness inspher'd: ‘There like the radiant Day-God shall you shine, ‘And wear the value of a precious Mine ‘Upon your back: nor shall you need to fear ‘Harsh envies storms; I like a Halcyon there ‘Shall keep all calm: then dear Sir come aboard; ‘More love to you no Lady shall afford. ‘Madam, said he, as fire makes fewel flame, ‘So love the like affections force may claim ‘In the beloved; but yours runs so high, ‘It quite orewhelms my grateful quality, ‘And brings me under: yet get up I must, ‘And gallop in contempt of heat and dust; ‘My business rapts me hence, nor can I stay ‘A formal leave to take, but must away. Forthwith he mounts, and rides as if in fear O'th' Gorgons head, or th' uglier Fiend he were; With greedy hast the way (as't were) devoures, And soon beholds the proud Parisian towers; Coming whereto, he much admires to see Such numerous troopes, and quaint variety Of fashions there; but could not fashion well Himself to stay, where fatal pride did dwel. Strait tries he other Quarters; but doth find To the same Falling-evill all inclin'd: Whence he concludes his Lady, that was sound In mind and manners, was not there t' be found. Canto IV. The Argument. Sir Antheon at his next remove Goes into Spain to seek his Love; Contemnes the wealth Sor' dezza showes, And stickles 'twixt engaged foes. No force of envious Fortune can divert From his fair aim a worthy Lovers heart, Resolv'd in's course all crosses to abide With patience, working 'gainst both wind &amp; tide, Such a true undertaker was our Knight; So firme in's purpose, that he did unite All his endeavours to the point of love, And towards that sweet centre still did move. The Sea-mans Needle varies and declines; But 'tis not so with brave heroick minds, Toucht by pure love; these steadily direct Their motions to their marks, and nere defect. A due respect to faith and honour (dear To Worthies) cau'sd this noble Cavalier Still to indulge his amours, to devise How to atchive his ardent enterprize, And think where next he should the name resound Of his Fidelta, nere enough renown'd. At last he did resolve to see what Spain Of worth and excellency did contain; Whether the women of that western coast Have orient beauties, as some men do boast; And whether their endowments be as rare And precious, as they rich in treasure are. Betwixt the potent realmes of Spain and France The Pyrenean hills are bold t'advance Their heads; so hoary, as they took much care To keep the treasures safe that hoorded are In their deep entralls. Over these (they say) The Gaules, too populous, did once make way, And by Iberus side new seats did find; And over these Sir Antheon now design'd To pass into Iberia. 'Twas not long Before they did ascend those high and strong Rock-ribbed mountains; when to's friend he said: ‘Some-where (I now remember) I have read ‘That once these hills took fire, whose mighty heat ‘Dissolv'd their minerals, and poured great ‘Currents of treasure down; though now through snow, ‘And a sharp penetrative air we goe: ‘But a true Lovers breast, that much doth hold ‘O'th torrid Zone, defies all force of cold; ‘Will fight with it at sharp, and whatsoere ‘To his designes shall opposite appear. Great Spain, whose strength is now in monarchy United, was divided anciently Into twelve kingdomes; through all which the Knight (Whom nothing can dismay, much less affright) Intends with speed to travel, and to try more The fortunes of a fresh discovery. When he had pass't those haughty mountains, Did heat infest him than the cold before: But his surmounting courage did despise Both Earths and Aires more threatning injuries; And like a River went, that without stay, Though with some windings, seeks the wealthy sea: Still was he sounding sweet Fidelta's name, And did her worth in every place proclaim; Making in wealthy Corduba more stay, To hear what people could of Lucan say, And th' Seneca's. As there he walkt along, And saw a house all moss't, but mainely strong, More like a Prison than a Palace; there Fixing his view, and drawing somewhat neare, Forth comes a woman well in years, but ill In fashion, seeming as some Hellish skill She did profess, so fiend-like her aspect, Mixing with carefulness a rude neglect. A tempest in her eies she seem'd to bear, Whence rough and wavy did her brow appear; Her Elfine hair was gray, but had been red; Her cheekes a nasty morphew over-spred; And like a rusty Gnomon was her nose, Thin as the bone that winter-weather showes; Her teeth were Or, but Argent were her lips; Her neck was speckled as with fairy-nips; Towards her bodies sordid Centre hung Her breasts like Rennet-bags, all knobb'd &amp; clung; And turned were her tanned hands to paws, So bent to rapine, and so arm'd with clawes. She with a false eye (like a Kite that spies A chick, and cunningly to catch it flies) Having descry'd some jewels rich and faire, Which (from his country brought) the Knight did weare, Did long to finger them; &amp; therfore came To him; and having set her lookes in frame, Thus said: Fair Sir, if from this publick street ‘You will withdraw, and please to set your feet ‘Within my gates, I shall to you impart ‘What haply Nectar-like will warm your heart, ‘And win your liking; come along, and see ‘What golden hope's in offer'd amity. He smiling went with her (brave Iason so VVith magical Medea once did goe,) Went with her int' a gallery that led T' a round built room, whose door she opened, Shew'd him a world of treasure shining there, And bade him enter while the coast was clear. But when, refusing, he a stand did make, She thus again his modesty bespake: ‘You see, blind Fortune has not been my foe, ‘That has vouchsaf't upon me to bestow ‘Such heaps of treasure; yet some foes I have, ‘Wild Prodigals. that strut about in brave ‘Attire, when scarce they have wherewith to buy ‘A cord, to mind them of their destiny: ‘By day they're lordly, yet with night conspire ‘To feed a base and ravenous desire: ‘Such youngsters oft invade my treasury, ‘As th' Elders did Susanna's chastity. ‘Now, as you seem a gallant man at arms, ‘If you'l secure me from such frightful harmes, ‘And be my champion, you shall share a part ‘Of all my wealth, but wholly have my heart: ‘Midas shall be an Ass to you; that King ‘Crœsus, scarce nam'd, not worth your envying: ‘My precious treasures with reflexive shine ‘Shall gild your brows, &amp; make your looks divine. ‘Those jewels that you weare are dimme &amp; poore, ‘Compar'd to many that I keep in store: ‘I'le give you richer in exchange, that may ‘My love, together with their light, display. With that, she wrung his finger, with intent To have pluckt thence its golden ornament, Wherein an Opall shin'd: but he, his blade Halfe-drawing, told her, if such pranks she plaid, He would hacke of her talons, send her head T'her feet, and shew it in grimme Gorgons stead. Then such a thundring stamp he gave, that all The gold &amp; silver chinkt, and th' Hagge did crawl Backe (like a Crab) in much affright, whilest he, Full of brave scorne and sparkling gallantry, Left her to Mammons mercy, laughing went, As furnisht for a whole mon'ths merriment. Soon after, meeting with a Matron grave, Who by her even carriage seem'd to have A well-pois'd temper, he enquired who That Beldam was that so much wealth did show, That with fair proffers veil'd her foul intents, And meant to cheat amidst her blandishments. ‘You mean, said she, Sordezza (as I guess,) ‘That Harpy-like, Hell-raking Sorceress, ‘Who gapes for gain as Doggs for cooling aire, ‘And earth-ward bends, affixing worldly care, ‘To the worlds Centre. If you have been in ‘Her house, that Hold of mischiefe, Shop of sin, ‘You owe much to your fortune, that you have ‘So safe return'd, and not remain'd her Slave. ‘For she not seldome layes her golden baites ‘For whom she likes; &amp; when those gay deceits ‘The Gulls have taken, she enchaunts them so, ‘That they her service never will forgoe, ‘But gladly as her vassals will remain, ‘And what she pleases to impose, sustain. ‘Yet a hard-hearted Mistress does she prove, ‘And great's her tyranny (pretending love) ‘To those that serve her, over rocks and hils ‘And dales she hurries them, while sweat distills; ‘Sends them to back the wild-bounding Sea, ‘And pass through perills to rich India; ‘With troubles, as with torrents over-bears ‘Their strength, &amp; with sharp cares their bowels tears; ‘Feeds them with scraps &amp; refuse; makes them go ‘Thinly araid through piercing winters snow; ‘Loosens their limbs with flesh-quakes, and doth make ‘Whilst others soundly sleep, the wretches wake. ‘This is no fabulous story which I tell, ‘But true and real. Therefore weighing well ‘Your late escaped dangers, with much joy ‘Reflect upon your precious liberty, ‘And shun as Serpents (if so wise you be) The air and track of ill society. Contented with this answer, thence he went, But not without a grateful complement For her intelligence, well seasoned VVith grave advice. His resolution led Him forward still, or rather urg'd him on: And as a Current being stopt, anon Flowes with more force: so if by chance he staid Long where he lik't, the greater hast he made In's following journeys. VVhen he came in sight Of fair Toledo (once the Moores delight) VVhich in the Centre of that kingdome stands On Tagus, famous for its golden sands; Beyond a thicket bordering on his way, He saw two gallants in a mortal fray Engaged, striking, thrusting, bending all Their forces to procure each others fall. Forthwith dismounting, towards them he goes, And (though in danger of their desp'rate blowes) Betwixt them steps, and bids them hold, or he Would send them where they better should agree; Askes them th' occasion whence their discord rose, And what might urge them to those angry blowes. Saies one of them: This fellow that you see, ‘That lookes like milk, and quakes for fear of me, ‘VVas not asham'd to tell me that he saw ‘My father (who his Pedegree doth draw ‘From Princes) on a founder'd Hackney ride ‘Sometime, and wear no weapon by his side; ‘Whereas (his foes well knew't) he wore a sword ‘Daily, as good as Bilbo could afford, ‘And us'd a trampling Gennet to bestride; ‘The King of Spain does on no better ride. Th'other with indignation said; This Boy, Whose tongue the Hangmans noose can only tye, ‘Sayes that my sister loves him, and doth wear ‘A bracelet (as he brags) made of her hair; ‘When I dare swear she holds him in disdain, ‘As courted by the bravest Don in Spain; ‘And's of that birth, and wealth, and beauty rare, ‘As well may drive mean Suitors to despair. ‘For this I challeng'd him; and if you had ‘Not interven'd (whereof he may be glad,) ‘I had by this time broch't him on my blade ‘Like a swoln Toad, and fatal work had made. ‘You both are valiant, said the Knight, no doubt; ‘And pity 'tis great spirits should about ‘Small matters tempt their fates: put up for shame ‘Those angry tooles; and if you'd purchase fame, ‘Draw them against your countries publick foes ‘In a just urgent quarrel; do like those ‘Ancient Heroes, Theseus, and the rest, ‘Resist ambitious wrongs, relieve th' opprest, ‘Release th' enthralled, and such monsters tame ‘As live like Harpyes, flying at all Game. ‘These are high waies to honour; but for toyes ‘To brawl is infamous, more fit for boyes ‘Than well-bred men, who wrongs should rightly weigh, ‘Nor in the ballance heavy hatred lay. ‘Whole kingdomes suffer for wild fervency ‘Of blood, and blindly-bold temerity: ‘And oft the Flow'rs of families (that might ‘Have done their country much obliging right) ‘By trifling quarrels have I known to fall, ‘And damp our hopes with sudden funeral. ‘Come, let me link your hands, as is most fit, ‘And in like manner let your hearts be knit; ‘And as your mettal is now found to be ‘Solid and firme, so prove your amity. This speech did work no less than Mercuries Pastoral musick, charm'd their enmities, And caused them (instead of angry blowes) To strike a league, and hate the name of foes. So home they went: but him that made their peace, Nor Love nor Destiny would yet release From painful taskes of travel. Thence he hyes To famous Sevil, where Columbus lyes; And coming there his Epitaph to view, Blowes off the dust with sighs, and much doth rue That a brave Ttraveller who bare a mind As ample as the world, should be confin'd T'a narrow vault; and he that had surveid New unknown stars, should be in darkness laid. Through many cities makes he then his way, But his chief Scene of business does he lay In fair Madrid; which (as sometimes a clown May rise to honour) from a vulgar town Is grown a royal seat. But neither there Nor elsewhere can he of Fidelta heare, Nor of such noble qualities as might Thither a Lady of much worth invite. VVherefore at present making there a stand, He meanes to visit some more hopeful land. Canto 5. The Argument. To Greece th' unwearied Lover hyes, All obvious dangers doth despise; A huge impetuous Serpent slayes, And on the ground a Braggart layes. The Knight now having 'gainst his passions strove, And made them all subservient to his Love, (That, like a Torrent, all things in its way Ore-bare) some other aires would yet assay, And either find his Lady, or dispread Her fame, and make her worth more honoured. His mind was bent on Greece, that once brought forth Wits, beauties, courages, of highest worth; Was Learnings fruitful mother, sending thence All arts, as from a happy confluence; And in such noble qualities excel'd, As scarcely have on earth been parallel'd. Towards that land with hoised sailes he went; And though he heard that Pirates do frequent Those Eastern Seas, yet forwards did he steer With dauntless heart, scarce knowing what to fear. On the wild Deep not many dayes he spent (Though oft beset with dangers incident To Sailours) ere he to Morea came, That had from Pelops a more ancient name. There travelling with much desire to see Things of most fame in faithful history, He most intensively that Isthmus view'd (Reaching about six miles in latitude) Which to have digged through, Caligula, Nero, and other Princes, did assay; That so two Seas which Nature had disjoyn'd Might as it were in marriage be combin'd, But Heaven forbad the March; strange prodigies Of blood that issued forth, of frightful cries, And sights of vengeful Furies, sent away The Pionieres with terrour and dismay; The Pow'rs celestial seeming thus to threat Mortalls for acts of insolence so great. With like desire transported was the Knight With clear-stream'd Alpheus to compare his sight; Upon whose flowry margin when he stood, Viewing the motions of the sportive Floud, He said; Fair River, that thy Arethuse ‘Dost follow under Seas to Syracuse, ‘But there dost thy beloved Nymph enjoy, ‘I envy much thy great felicity; ‘But hope withall that I, who likewise go ‘Through sundry coasts for love, shall not bestow ‘My paines in vaine, but finally possess ‘My dear delight, my high-priz'd happiness; ‘So other Lovers at that bliss of mine ‘Will look with languishment, as I at thine. After some dayes int' Attica he came, And for Minerva's City of much fame Did look; but nothing did like Athens see, That sometimes was the fruitfull'st nursery Of arts and armes; brave worthy warriours bred, Such as elsewhere have scarce been equalled; And through the world such streames of learning sent, As have supply'd all wits with nourishment: The Genius of the place (as did appeare) Making the phansy quick, the judgment cleare. Now in regard that Attick faith was known T'have been so firme, that 't was proverbial grown, Sir Antheon with fair hope did feed his mind, That there he should his faithful Lady find. But as an Alchymist that long hath swet, Pufft, and projected, the rare Stone to get, But nought save ashes finds, doth sigh and mourne, For that his furnace seems the fatall urne Wherein his wealth lyes buried: so the Knight, Not finding his chiefe jewel and delight, Felt discontents arising in his breast Like vap'rous stormes, disturbing much his rest. But with Philosophies instilled Balme He cur'd the wound of griefe, and did becalme His spirits so, that cheerfully he went Forwards, arriving, ere much time was spent, At those Fame-widn'd Streights, Thermopylæ; VVhere Xerxes host, which (as Historians say) Had soakt up flouds as it along did pass, VVas by brave Lion-like Leonidas VVith some few Spartan troopes dismembred sore, Full thirty thousand weltring in their gore: Such fire strikes fortitude, when throughly steel'd VVith resolution, that disdaines to yield. Having well view'd that place, his way he tooke Into the parts of Phocis, there to looke For Pytho, famoused by mighty Jove; VVho by a rare experiment to prove VVhere this enflowred Globes firme navel stands, Sent forth out of his thunder-swaying hands Two Eagles, one of them, fro'th' shining East Directed, th'other from the cloudy West; These, flying, met with weary wings about That town, and by th' encounter clear'd the doubt. From thence the Traveller with high desire Marcht to Parnassus, whose two tops aspire To pass the clouds, and Embleme-wise express Of God and Nature the clear knowledges. At foot thereof the pure Castalian spring (That oft had mov'd the Muses sonnes to sing) He tasted; and beheld th' adjoyning Cave, Whence sometime wise Apollo answers gave. Then, as that liquor had with fluency Inspir'd him, thus he said: How happy be ‘Those wits, whom time and Fortune do allow ‘To walk at leisure on the lofty brow ‘Of this fair Mount; as in the Court of Iove, ‘Embeam'd with starry lights, Celestials move! ‘They with no small delight the trackes may see ‘Where th' ancient Muses danc't, so orderly, ‘As th' hosts of Heaven do march; and rest in those ‘Sweet Laurel-arbours, where they did compose ‘Songs of choice subjects, and fresh garlands made ‘For happy browes, whose fancies would not fade. ‘But my condition's like the restless stone ‘Of Sisyphus; and hence I must be gone, ‘To seek a cure for my love-strucken heart; ‘Which onely sweet Fidelta can impart. This having utter'd with some discontent Sign'd in his cloudy brow, forthwith he went Towards Helicon, a mountain high in site And fame, wherein the Muses did delight. Coming in view thereof, the careful Swaines That fed their cattel on the fertile plaines, Told him how sore their country was distrest By a huge Serpent, which did so infest And rob their folds, that few or none could keep Their flocks in safety, nor securely sleep. Near to the place where famous Hesiod said That he his frisking Lambkins pastured, Within a hollow rock this Monster lay, At the hils foot; not stirring thence by day; But soon as Night did from her iron carre Fling rusty darkness, would he forrage far With great celerity, and take their prey From Wolves or Lions, were they in his way. And as th' Enchantress Circe long agoe Did into Scylla's bay infection throw: So into th' Muses springs he did inject Foul poisons, and their purities infect. His close-wrought skales were like the Crocodiles, Scarce penetrable: nor could all the wiles And stratagems that Rusticks could devise, Prevail this Cattel-killer to surprize; But he not seldome did their arts elude, Not seldome had their greatest force subdu'd. The hardy Knight now felt his heart on fire At this report, so much he did desire To benefit the country, and so much A kind compassion did his bowels touch. So, having purchas'd firme artillery, Such as the great Bow-bearer us'd, when he 'Gainst Python went; and having with him took A Guide or two that durst on danger look, He climb'd the Mount a pretty space above The Monsters den, &amp; would not thence remove Till Night with shades the Hemisphere did hide, And forth for prey the horrid Snake did glide: Hearing ere long his rustling skales below, And thence presuming that he forth did goe, From the hills side he boldly did descend To the holes mouth, that passage to defend; And setting some dry Laurels there on fire, Did mean to see the direful beast retire. About such time as the Day-Roses spring, Back from his haunts and spoilful forraging The Serpent sweeping comes; his bulk was vast, And when extended, like a trailed Mast Or oaken Beame it seem'd; his chappes besmear'd VVith blood and poison, terrible appear'd; His teeth like iron pikes, his eyes like fire; And with the black fumes which he did expire, The air was tainted, blasted was the grass, And leaves of trees, where he along did pass. VVhen he drew near t' his den, and saw the fire, He forthwith kindled a more rageful ire, Quickn'd his deadly forces, bigger yet Did swell, and seem'd his forked tongue to whet; Hissing so loud, as if a thunder-stone, Enwrapt in flames, had from a cloud been thrown Into the deep: then on with widened jawes He comes; when straight his bow Sir Antheon draws, And sends a shaft (that would have pierc't a coat Of double Mail) into his gulfy throat; Then with another quencht his flaming eye, Ripping his heads smooth seams so fatally, That, mad with anguish, up and down he flung; Now wreathed round, then stretcht himself along; Somtimes shot forwards, wheel'd somtimes aside; Then with his sharp tail lasht the ground, &amp; dy'de. When hasty Fame had publisht what was done, From all parts thither did the people run, Straining their throats with Pæans, Eulogies, And all expressions of triumphal joyes: The Swaines (ambitious then to shew their skills) Made jolly Musick with their reeds and quills; And to their humble houses did invite The highly-praised, ever-honour'd Knight, Off'ring him homely kindnesses, who took All in good part, and at good-will did look. But when he nothing could amongst them find To feed his hopes, or ease his love-sick mind, His leave he took, and travell'd on to see Some farther coasts in his discovery. Within that countries bounds he shortly came, VVhere warlike Castriot wonne unbounded fame; And taking a survey of Actium (nigh To which Augustus quell'd Mark Anthony; As the Venetians did long after foile The Turks, and took inestimable spoil) He found that Fame his acts had thither blown, And that the Serpents slaughter was well known To th' people there, who gave him therefore great Respect, and with much kindness did him treat. But as a Canker creeps amongst the best Of Plants; so Envy'mongst these civilest Of people did appear, and did reflect VVith all the scorneful signes of disrespect Upon the Knight. A youngster of some note, A lusty big-limb'd bragging Epirot, Full of disdain, came stalking to him near, Star'd in his face, and thus began to jeer: ‘Sir Knight (if such you prove) it seems to me ‘A matter of no small indignity, ‘That to your self such honour you will take ‘For crushing a poor worm, a silly Snake; ‘Surely your hungry stomach barks for praise ‘As wel as food, that strive such fame to raise. ‘If Hercules a Lions skin that wore, ‘Had with your impudence been skinnedore, ‘He had at honour cast his club in vain, ‘And had been lookt upon with much disdain. ‘I'le have your mettal more acutely tride, ‘And mean to prove how well you can abide ‘The clashing of a sword: then (if you dare) ‘Ride forth with me into the open air, ‘And shew me how your doughty blade will bite; ‘For Knighthood shall you shame, or with me fight. The challenge was accepted, and anon The Knight was mounted; but he scarce had gone Five hundred paces, ere a stand he made, And bade the Challenger unsheath his blade, And mettal shew: he turn'd, and somewhat spoke In hast; but th' other with a nimbler stroke Cut off his speech, and some part of his cheek Together, which he on the ground might seek. And now that his hot humour 'gan to flow, He felt his courage cool, nor did he know Whether to venture for another wound; When straight the bold Knight fell'd him to the ground, And then dismounting, graspt him by the throat, Whilest he for Quarter cry'd with piteous note. ‘Caitiffe, said he, thy life I do disdain ‘To take, or put thee to deserved pain; ‘It is enough t' have proved to thy face, ‘And signed with thy blood, that thou art base. ‘Rise lubber that thou art with heart so cold, ‘Do me some service here, my stirrop hold ‘Whilst I remount; and likewise mindful be ‘Thy tongue to hold in strangers company. He readily obey'd, and quickly show'd By's homage, that to him his life he ow'd; Of fame regardless, so that thence he might Traile back his limbs, &amp; not be slaughter'd quite, The Knight then call'd his friend (who stood aloof To see this fighting-match, this martial proof Of metal;) and with him advancing on, Came shortly into th' coasts of Macedon; There notice tooke of Pella, famoused For that it had the mightiest Monarch bred; And of Siderocaspæ, where the ground With precious minerals doth so abound, As metals grew there, or in a royal sort Plutus, the God of wealth, there kept his court. But hearing nothing of that jewel there, Which he above all treasures did indeare, He journeyed thence to Thessaly in hast, A country with all Natures favours grac't; Where he Olympus view'd, so wondrous high, It plainly seemd to shoulder up the sky, As lofty Fame the clouds; where likewise tall Othrys (that witness'd the rude Centaures fall) He did survey; and with no small delight On Ossa there and Pelion fixt this sight. When he arriv'd at Tempe, and saw there The face of Nature smiling all the year, A bounteous soile, adorn'd with various flowe'rs, Clear shining rivulets, and shady bow'rs, VVherein the lively birds did hop and play, And taught the wild woods many a pleasant lay; He stood, as struck into a deep amuse, And said: ‘O, if I worthy were to chuse ‘My place of residence; and with me here ‘This ages ornament, Fidelta were; ‘Here would we gul old Time in pleasant sort, ‘Inventing ('mongst the Sylvanes) quaint disport; ‘Under green leavy Laurels, interwove, ‘VVe would repose, and dream of nought but love; ‘With soft sweet flowers would we strew our way, ‘And make thereof fresh chaplets every day; ‘Our loves so ful of crosses, would we carve ‘In knotty Oaks that might the work preserve; ‘And birds should learn our oft-repeated songs, ‘Of what to true affections force belongs. ‘But ah! I must be gone, the Fates ordain ‘Some other meeting-place then on this Plain; ‘More painful travels must I undertake, ‘That may more pleasant my fruition make. This speech being utter'd, and with sighes pursu'd, He march ere long where he Larissa view'd, A City honour'd for Achilles sake, That Grecian chief, who there his birth did take. Thence passing on with some severe delight, He on Pharsalos lookt, near which in fight Cæsar and Pompey joyn'd, resolv'd to stand All shockes and hazards for the worlds command. He purpos'd to have seen hard-metall'd Thrace Oft-frozen Hebrus, and the adjoyning place Where the wild Mænades did piece-meal teare Renowning Orpheus, throwing here and there His bleeding limbes, who th' Sirens had out-sung, And seen their instruments of musick flung Into the Ocean. But he chang'd his mind, When (to his greatest comfort) he did find, That as a pleasant field, neglected, growes Squalid, and fair fertility doth lose: So there for want of discipline and arts, The people were from all praise-worthy parts Greatly estrang'd, were now grown barbarous, Rechless, debaucht, and pusillanimous; As loth they were the Lordly Turks should be Taught how to reach to honours high degree; Or else those Tyrants had for some offence Beaten out all their sparks of excellence. No signature of lovely vertue saw He there that might a worthy Lady draw Those coasts to visit, or there make her home, If she by accident should thither come: VVhich things well ponder'd, caused him to make A stop, and think what next to undertake. Canto VI. The Argument. The Gallant now his Scene doth lay In Sicily, and on the Sea Rescues a Knight from wrackful waves; On land a Ladies honour saves. As those that of clear Phœbus did enquire About obscure events, of their desire Did sometimes fail, and doubtful went away: So though the Knight consulted night and day With wise experienc'd Eubulus, yet he Could finde but little ground of certainty To fix his thoughts upon, nor well did know Where next he should his wonted paines bestow. At last, resolv'd he was to range the fields Of Sicily, and try what worth that yields; An Isle that in the mid-land Sea doth lye, As vertue stands in mediocrity. For loves and warres it sometimes famous was, And still its fellow-Islands doth surpass In things of note: the men ingenious are; The women, like to wood-Nymphs, sweet &amp; faire: And 't was presum'd, because the people spend Much paines in fields (which Poets did intend, Who feign'd that Saturne hid bis sickle there) The currents of their lives did run more cleare From vicious taints, than others idly spent; And worthy persons did the coast frequent. Besides, whereas long since, to plant that Isle, People (invited by its wealthy soile) From Corinth, Sparta, Athens, flocking came, And other Cities of high worth and fame; 'Twas credible their vertues would not be Extinct, but shine yet in their progeny. These things wel weigh'd, Sir Antheon &amp; his friend, Who to make proofe thereof did now intend, In a fair ship lancht forth; that (as ore-joy'd To be by persons of prime worth emploi'd,) While the winds whisiled, on the waters danc'r, And forwards with auspicious course advanc't, Passing by sundry Islands famous made By Poets, that therein their Scenes had laid. But when of Sicily they came in sight, The aire grew turbid, and the winds did fight, Whirling about with such a threatful sound, As they forthwith the vessell would have drown'd; As the like mischiefe they had lately done To a tost Barke that on a rock did runne. It was a Ship wherein a youthful Knight Of Malta sail'd; that in this others sight Was dasht upon the hard and craggy side Of Scylla (which wise Sea-men most avoid,) And with th' allision split and shatter'd sore, As all her barking Dogges the Barke had tore. So have I known a globe of snow to roll Down from a hill-top, all compact and whole, Till some hard obstacle it met, but fly In pieces then, and wildly scatter'd lye. All perisht in the shipwracke save the Knight, Who full of caution and of motion light, Into the ship-boat leapt, enforc't t' obey False winds, that turning straight another way, Drove him to deep despaire; who now did flote Near to Charybdis whose vast gulfy throat Had quickly swallow'd him, but that our brave Heroick Lover, vent'ringfar to save The wretched Passenger (that seem'd to be A person of some eminent degree) Drew him into his vessel, interpos'd, And him from straits of horrid danger los'd, Banisht his baleful woes, and lively joyes Recall'd into his death-expecting eyes: Soone as the bellowing surges of the Maine Grew tamely silent, and the Heavens serene, So that they well could into Harbour get, Our Knight on shore his now-call'd brother set, VVith wine refresht him, waftage did provide, And all things for his voyage fit beside; Giving him cause in Malta to proclaime His noble favours, and divulge his fame. Thither he went; but not before he show'd What services for a sav'd life he ow'd; Debts which he would with speaking heart agnize, And gage for payment all his faculties. Of all strange things that Travellers admire In Sicily, there's none like Ætna's fire, That (unextinct) hath burn'd from age to age, And sometimes with such high impetuous rage, That, belching out flames, cinders, ashes, smoke, It threatned wholly to ore-whelme and choke That Island, striking all the rest with fear Lest the worlds conflagration now were neare. The hill was less incensed at this time, Giving the sprightful Gallant leave to climbe Its steep and rocky sides, &amp; to survey Some chinkes and clefts thorough which the wind makes way Into its bowlls, and like bellowes blowes The fire therein, that without ceasing glowes, As being with stuff combustible supply'd, Which Nature there does plenteously provide. Then came he to the place where some did say Empedocles his iron slippers lay, Thrown out 'oth' furnace, after he had cast Himself into the flame, and breath'd his last; Thus stealing out o'th' world, to seeme to be Deathless, and honour'd as some Deity. This mov'd the Knights inseparable friend To fall int' a discourse o'th' fatal end Of blindly-bold ambition, and to tell With how great danger it doth upward swell; How (like to smoke) it doth obliquely rise, But falls directly from high dignities; How Giant-like it 'gainst the Gods doth go, And under proud feet layes Religion low; Stickes not to violate with impious hands Of blood or amity the strictest bands; Subverts well-founded governments, with Fate (As't were) conspiring all to ruinate. When now 'bout objects much to be admir'd, They rather had their limbs, than senses, tir'd, Down went they from the Mountain to the Plain, Whose bounteous soile glads Italy and Spain, Malta and Barbary, with rich supplies Of graine, the welcom'st of commodities. Led on by sweet Affects, the way they found To Syracuse, a City much renown'd By Maro's Muse, who thither did resort, Preferring it sometimes to Cæsars court, It was against great Romes ambitious wrong By God-like Archimed defended long; Who seem'd at threatning ships to hurle at once Fierce lightning-flames and fulminary stones, So that th' astonisht Victor gave command That none should, 'gainst that Artist heave his hand; Who yet i'th'tumult 'mongst his figures found, VVas soone disfigur'd by a deadly wound. This caus'd Sir Antheon his sepulchral stone With teare-shot eyes to view, and look thereon For the Cylinder and the Sphere he made; Defiring oft ere Natures debt he paid, To have them figur'd on his tombe, to show VVhat to his industry the world did owe. The Knight now having seene what worthy was Of observation there, did forwards pass, Minded to see the place where Poets say The Stygian Monarch pluckt Proserpina Into his iron coach, and hurrying fast, A veile of shades about her beauties cast: Seiz'd neare to Enna was this gallant prize, VVhere the fair Islands very navell lyes; A medow stor'd with flowers so odorous, That snuffing Hounds do in its bosome lose The sents of beasts pursu'd; about it round, Tufted with neat trees is the rising ground, And nourisht with coole waters, gather'd nigh, As't were t' admire a gaping vastity In rockes adjoyning; into which (they say) Pluto in triumph rode, yet lost the day; Black night advancing from her drowsy seat To welcome him, and on his Queen to wait. Nat far beyond these wonderments, that might Retard his motion, travell'd had the Knight; But that (as if lusts wild-fires fatally Rag'd in that coast) a wronged Ladies Cry Sent from the Concave of a valley neare, Did with amazement strike his listning eare. She being fresh as May, of lineage high, And wealth beyond the most in Sicily, Had oft been seen, attended by her Maid Alone, to walke there in the pleasing shade; And (as it were) the Wood-Nymphs steps to trace Into a mossy Cave, a pretty space From her high-seated Mansion: That had mov'd A bruitish Don, that wealth and woman lov'd B'ove fame or honesty, in wait to lye To win her by surprize, and forcibly Take her to wife, that so enjoy he might A beauty rare, a fortune infinite. That this rude wickedness might then be wrought, Three Russians (wild as Boreas sons) he brought With him; and now they had the trembling Prey Amongst them, and were forcing her away. But brave Sir Antheon having got a view ('Mongst shady bushes) of that salvage crew, Cast where t'assaile them with his brandisht blade, And that so closely, as they did invade The noble Lady; whom he either wou'd Rescue out of their hands, or spend his blood. And Eubulus, although more fit to give Grave counsels and instruction how to live, Than deadly tooles to wield, did yet advance Bravely with sword in hand, and forward prance. These suddenly, as from an ambush, met Those worst of Thieves, where ere they well could set The Lady down, their champion to the ground VVas brought, engoared with a gastly wound; The Knights keen weapon soon asunder shred The sinews of his neck, and laid his head Upon his shoulder, there a sleep to take Than night more heavy, never more to wake. The like did Eubulus, his sword ore-took Another, as he turn'd his head to look At's gasping Mate; the steel stook in his jaw, And being forced thence, did rudely draw His shatter'd teeth; so fell he likewise down From his chaf't Steed, and dasht his hairy crown 'Gainst the hard earth. Those other two that saw Such deadly slashing, quickly did withdraw, And fled Sir Antheons force, who them a while Pursu'd, but thought it fitter to recoil To a fair Lady, than foul varlets chace, VVhose brutish courses mankind did disgrace. He found her almost where he left her, so Empalsied with affrights, she scarce could go; Her blood being like to Niobe's when grown Stone-cold she was, &amp; scarce from marble known. But his warm hand (who was all love, all fire,) Gently embalming hers, did soon inspire Her veins with heat, and made her spirits from Their sad Retreat with lively motion come. His softer language too her inward pain Much eas'd, and rosy tinctures fetcht again Into her cheeks; as when dim clouds away Are blown, clear Heaven more beauties doth display: Thus comforted, he usher'd her along Unto her home, and set her safe among Her dearest friends who hearing, what was done, Shed tears for joy (like rain by th'shining Sun Fairely embrighten'd) striving to express To her all love, to him all thankfulness. And as Ætolian Achelous flow'd VVith bounty towards some that had bestow'd Their paines to chace the Calydonian Beast, Perithous, Lelex, Theseus, at the least: So strove this noble Ladyes worthy friends To make the Knight and Eubulus amends VVith royall entertainment, for their high Merit, and most obliging courtesy. The bounty of the house was full and free, Yet could not work upon the constancy Of brave Sir Antheon, there to fix his mind; For that another Lady (though disjoyn'd In place) was linkt to him with lines of love, Which, howsoere extended, firme would prove To seek that sweetning Object of desire (Which finde he would, or finally expire.) Thence hasts he to Palermo, that a thin Phœnician Colonie had sometime bin; But by additions grew so stately great And populous, that 'tis a princely seat; A City of such eminence and fame, As may some soveraignty o're others claime: Fair streets, brave structures, rich magnificence Of Temples, give the place preeminence; Which yet had worthier been its head to reare With honour, if Fidelta had been there. But none there knew her, nor had winged Fame Wafted the pleasing sweetness of her name Into those parts, which caus'd the pensive Knight To look on Beauties there with small delight, But still to travel on, in mind to try The close of a true Lovers destiny. The next place where he did some dayes reside, Messina was; whose gates stood open wide, As in derision of the Turks proud threats, Who oft for prizes near that Haven waites. There such pure noble liquour did he tast, As caus'd Augustus to forget his past Sorrowes; &amp; with the Knight wrought so a while: But shortly did his discontents recoile, And sadly did he fold his armes, when there No newes he could of rare Fidelta heare. Other fair Cities made he with his love Acquainted, but like Fortune still did prove, Finding the peoples greater part to be Light, vaine, and void of solid constancy; So that it seem'd impertinent to spend Much time in such an Isle for such an end As he design'd; yet howsoere he staid A while, as disappointed, not dismaid. Canto VII. The Argument. To Belgium goes the gallant Knight, Avoids Ebbrezza's lewd delight: And rings (to anger highly stirr'd) Two Hogges of Epicurus Heard. Our famous Travellours transendent loves Like to a forest-kindled flame, that moves With hot contention, seeming to look red For anger, that it can no further spread. He knew a brave heroick fortitude (And such was his) should never seem subdu'd Nor wearied out; but should as much disdaine A faint submission unto grief or pain, As in a quarrell once engag'd, to yield After slight hurts, and basely quit the field. The Spaniards, that of large Dominions boast, And run Division so from coast to coast, Had told him that their Belgick provinces Bred famous Worthies, such as did professe All arts, and had such pregnant phantasies, That they the nautick compass did devise, Swift-hurrying Chariors, Clockes, Typography, Quaint musicke, lively Limning, Tapestry, With many other rarities of wit, For pleasure some, but more for benefit. They told him also that the women there Are starres of beauty, of complexion cleare, And quicke in motion, thinking it scarce fit To yield to men precedency in wit, Or t' any Europæan Dames more fame For noble vertue than themselves may claime. These speeches blew the Knights internal fire, And kindled in his breast a great desire That coast to visit, and thereof to take A full survey for faire Fidelta's sake. Provided therefore of good shipping straight, That near danc't under a more hopefull fraight, He plows his passage through the foaming Sea, By good direction finding out the way To that low-seated region; where he lands, And in no little admiration stands, Viewing its bulwarks, made with mighty pain And cost, the raging billows to restrain, That threat to drive down all, and once did drown Many fair fields, and many a goodly town; Whose towers &amp; steeples, when the season's clear And water low, like marine rocks appear. ‘Friend Eubulus, said he, these works are rare; ‘And they that thus secure their borders, are ‘More to be fam'd than Hercules. For he ‘Found work enough to win the victory ‘Of Achelous, that one river strain'd ‘His nerves, before the conquest he obtain'd. ‘But long (I hear) these Patriots have withstood ‘The furious charges of the brinish Floud, ‘Though thousand rivers to their Neptunes aide ‘Bring their fresh forces, readily conveid, ‘And oft great Æolus in puffing hast ‘Sends his bold slaves to lay the country wast. The painful Dutch may teach us industry, ‘And fill our hearts with pleasing hopes t'enjoy ‘After a small time what we much desire, ‘And what we travel for at length acquire; ‘Though yet we find that Fortune seldome goes ‘Our way, nor friendly favours oft bestows. Thus spake he; thus from every thing he saw, Some useful observation did he draw. Then warm with wonted fire, he foreward went, Still wondring at the pains that had been spent In cutting trenches, dreining marishes, Casting up banks, and many works like these; VVhereof some tend to profit, others aim At pleasure, all true industry proclaim. No Statist, on some great embassage sent 'Twixt Prince and Prince, can be more diligent About the weighing of those nice affaires That are the subject of his pressing cares, Than was the Knight industrious to enquire For the dear object of his deep desire. Yet balkt he Amsterdam (though rich and fair That City be) for that he heard there are So many lost Religions there t' be found, Like to Medusa's Snakes together wound, Yet hissing at each other; such a croud Of sects and heresies, and all allow'd Their dotages, that he despair'd to see Fidelta in such faithless company. But with no small content he view'd the town That bred Erasmus, Belgium's chief renown, Who with pure flowing style far off to drive Th' Augean filth of Barbarisme did strive; Render'd the Muses walkes more sweet and clean, And made their troubled spring run clear again. To Zutphen when he came, and heard some tell That there that star of honour, Sidney, fell, A cloud of sorrow over-cast his face, And thence a showr'e of tears distil'd apace, VVhilst freshly he remembred that the fame Of that brave Heroe to Atlantis came, Long ere his amourous task he undertook; And that his worthy Father bad him look Upon such noble Patterns, and aspire VVith main contention of a high desire To reach their excellencies, and to be (If possible) their equal in degree. Thence goes he on, nor slacks a Lovers pace, Proclaiming his design in every place; And lets no object over-slip him, which VVith any knowlege might his mind enrich. The Sun (with fervent labour looking red) Declin'd apace towards his western bed, VVhen by the forrest of Ardenna's side, An house of large receipt the Knight espi'de, Such as wherein he thought that strangers might Refresh themselves by day, repose at night. At his approch, so wild a noise therein He heard, as if the Thyades had bin There with their Timbrels: howsoere, being tir'd With travel, there to rest he much desir'd. Straight then he enter'd; and so might he well, Sith open stood the gate like that of Hell, Those there assembled being void of fear, For that by valiant Bacchus arm'd they were. The house was full of Ramblers, some whereof Did break unsavoury jests, and vilely scoffe; Others sang Catches; some leapt over stooles; Others grown qualmish, curst th' unquiet fooles; Some crost in love deplor'd their bad success; Others with laughter mockt their heaviness; Some like the Lapithes and Centaures brawl'd; But all drank deep, and for more liquor call'd With thirsty throats, save those that had before (Like mellow fruits) dropt down, and strew'd the floor. Thus as hot sultry weather sundry wise VVorks upon things of different qualities, Hardens some substances, makes others flow; Withers some Plants, &amp; makes their fellows grow: So did the fervid liquor of the grape The humours of that drunken Rabble shape Int' several follies, causing them t' express Their tempers by intemperate rudenesses. Amidst them sate Ebbrezza (so she hight, Whose courtship was their solace and delight) Deep-drencht in wine, yet such an Ocean more Desiring, as no bottom had nor shore. Like a great Puff the blown-up Fatling was, Filling a large chair with her fleshy mass: Her face was fully bladder'd, in whose sphere Her eyes like flamy meteors did appear; And in her fiery nose (that towards her chin Inclin'd) the quintessence o'th quaffing sin Seem'd bottled up: Her bagging cheeks so low, And trebble chinne did hang, that little show Her neck did make, although no little charge Maintain'd a thorow-fare, a gulf so large: Her palsied arms and hands could scarcely own Themselves by shape, they were so over-grown: Like a foul ruffled pillow either breast Appear'd, whereon Silenus well might rest His seldome-sober head: Her belly soft VVas like a mossy mount, with laughter oft (As with an earth-quake) shook: And in such sort Those Limbs that should her weighty bulk support, Were swolne with Dropsy, that they did appear Not legs, but logs, such monstrous props they were; Nor could she eas'ly move them, when to bed She willing was to go, and must be led. On one side of her stood a Cask repleat VVith lusty wine; on th' other side a great Nicotian boxe, which duly she did ply, Smoking and quaffing still alternately; That so being moist and dry by turnes, she might Tast her Delights with greater appetite. Sir Antheon smil'd when such a Rout he saw, And knew not whether he should straight withdraw Out from that mad-brain'd Company, or stay To see the Humorists some tricks to play. At length the guzzling Gossip he bespake Thus: may we not be bold awhile to make ‘Our randevouz amongst you, and to be ‘Merry with this light-hearted Company? ‘At least be furnisht with things requisite ‘For Travellers, who with the morning-light ‘Arose, and since have journyed without stay, ‘Though our vext stomachs chid the tedious way? ‘For we upon an urgent business go ‘Of love, like arrows sent from Cupids bow, ‘And on the sweets of hope may seem to feed, ‘Yet yield perforce we must to Natures need; ‘And (that our worse parts may do service to ‘Our better) eat and drink, as others do. ‘Sir, if you come to drink, said she, sit down, ‘Here's liquor soon will take you by the Crown, ‘Will make those sober looks of yours to stare ‘Like to a Comet, conjure down your care, ‘Make all your fears to vanish like my smoke, ‘And arm you 'gainst encountring dangers stroke. ‘You shall not need to wear here by your side ‘A threatning sword, to shew your valours pride: ‘My Caske's a Magazine, and you may hence ‘Be strongly furnisht for secure defence: ‘Then lay that dandling weapon by, sith fooles ‘(And onely such) will so expose their tooles; ‘And take you rather what our house presents, ‘Full pots and pipes, the chief of implements. Then laught, then belcht she, &amp; then tooke a cup, And drank to him; but slowly heav'd it up, That, taking a long draught, she might thereby More fully, what she dearly lov'd, enjoy. Meane while slept forth two Roarers, fierce and bold As fire-drakes, who the Knight too plainely told That he must singe a merry Catch or two, And what their Mistris had enjoyn'd him, do, Or there he should not quench his thirst, nor be Honour'd to mixe with that Society. He, thus provokt to shew his metal (more Than Meleager, when the sylvane Boare Assail'd him) clapt his hand upon his blade, And fuming with high indignation, said: ‘Feed still, ye nasty Hoggs, each at his trough; ‘I scorne what you deny, and have enough ‘To see you swill and guzzle at this rate; ‘Who onely staid to view (the more to hate) ‘Your Bucchanalian freakes, and all those vile ‘Impurities, that your loath'd lives defile. ‘As much do I disdain to quaffe, and sing ‘Those ribauld rhimes wherewith your rooms do ring, ‘As from faire humane dignity to throw ‘My self, and like a groveling beast to go. Then with a threatning look, as straight he wou'd Have mixt delicious wine with Drunkards blood, And dampt their frantick mirth, he left the den Of those wild beastly Revellers. But then Did the plumpe Dame begin her voice to strain, And call'd to him to stay, and call'd again, Inviting him with promises, that might Work on a green and frolicke appetite. When she perceiv'd her words were like a gale To drive him on, and nought they could prevaile, She after him those jolly Champions sent, That lately gave him so much discontent, And bade them melt their language in to faire In treaties, that he would with them repaire Backe to her house. They hasted, reel'd, and fell, Yet to him came, and did their message tell, Courting him fairely at their first assay: But when they saw he still would keep his way, They call'd him Lout and Beast, &amp; (to have staid His Errantry) bold hands upon him laid. He quickly shooke them off, and train'd them on, Till out o'th' view of others they were gone; Then, as the King of beasts, that (hunted) burnes With wrath, at last on his Pursuers turnes: So did he face about to fall on those That follow'd him, &amp; 'twixt them dealt his blowes. Then, having with stiffe gagges distended wide Their chaps, &amp; their rude hands behind them tyde, The next part that most workeman-like he plaid, Was that a small arch in the bridge he made Of eithers nose, and both together wyr'd; Saying, Now you that busily conspir'd ‘Against me, may with heads together laid ‘Plot your Release, but hardly call for aide. ‘Stand billing there like Doves, &amp; spend your blood ‘With comfort; 'tis for your dear countries good: ‘Rather like Swine for Mast or other fruit ‘Stand gaping, but forbear awhile to root: ‘Be taught, ye Sots, to drink more sparingly, ‘And Strangers treat with more civility. This having spoke, he left them to bespue Each others breast, and their ill manners rue. Never did Bee on top of Hybla high, Or faire Hymettus, with more industry Search the sweet cells of every vernant flow'r, From the Dayes entrance to the Evening hour, Then he with care perform'd the great inquest Of Love, that carelesty disturb'd his rest. VVhen he had view'd each City, every Port, And almost every place of great resort, Yet was unsatisfy'd in his desire, It was his purpose to have marc'ht up higher, T' have seen the neighb'ring nation, o're whose heads His shady wings the Austrian Eagle spreads: But when being certify'd by sundry Posts And Legates (sent into those lower coasts To take up newes) that sure there could not be Any such Lady found in Germany As he enquired for, sith Fame no where Is busier with her hundred tongues than there, And quickly would such excellence discloud, Although wrapt up in a Cimmerian shroud; He paus'd a while, and like a Student far'd, VVho reading sentences obscure and hard, Is shrewly puzzled, yet will truth pursue Through misty walkes, and seek a clearer view. He could not but give way to discontent, Yet scorned neretheless to slack the bent Of his Resolve, or any signe to show That his high courage did dejected grow. Canto VIII. The Argument. Our worthy Lover takes his way Towards farre-fam'd Eutopia, Finds there Fidelta, claimes his prize, And triumphs in connubial joyes. In all assayes the courage of our Knight Shew'd (like his sword) a temper exquisite, Bearing so true an edge, as hardest fate That ere encountr'd it could nere rebate. This rais'd his thoughts, adapted him for high Atchievements, form'd him for great dignity; Quickn'd his hopes, and wrought upon his mind Further to seek what most he wisht to finde. But as a Sapling on a mountaine pight, When the rude winds tumultuously doe fight, Bends several wayes, as surly blasts impell: So tost with passions was the Knight, nor well What course in's business might be taken, knew, Nor in what coast he should his quest renew. Some thoughts he had great Britain to have seen, An Isle once famous for a Fairy Queen; But hearing then (as who now does not heare?) That Rapine, Fraud, &amp; Treachery were there, Acting their Hellish plots in peace and war, As common as high wayes but deeper far; He could not hope Fidelta there to finde, Where people were to falshood most inclin'd. Nor could he think it safe for him to tread Where Trappes &amp; Snares so covertly were laid. Some other nations ment he to assay; But Fame unwilling seem'd to give him way, Reproching them with manners so impure, As no fair noble Lady could endure. Amidst the Puzzle of designes, his friend (Who on him cheerefully did still attend) Thus spake: Small reason have we to complain ‘That our great labours have been spent in vain; ‘For we have seen what made Vlysses wise, ‘Manners and Cities differing in their guise, ‘And government. But haply, had we show'd ‘At first lesse rashness, &amp; more time bestow'd ‘In consultations, we had better sped, ‘And our desire long since accomplished ‘There is (discover'd by an English Knight, ‘Much-honour'd More) a land, Eutopia hight, ‘Not far from our Atlantis, though in wrath ‘Beyond it far; a land that bringeth forth ‘(As Fame reports) a brave and noble race ‘Of people, that account all vices, base, ‘Maintain fair rights, and love to peace profess, ‘Alike detesting war and wickedness. ‘Now lately have some thoughts possest my mind ‘That there we shall your long sought Lady find, ‘That land being less with vicious customs stain'd ‘Than those whereof we have the knowledg gain'd: ‘If then you please that proofe hereof be made, ‘We will retire (like Planets retrograde) ‘Towards our native coast, and so, no doubt, ‘Shall find ere long that famous country out. Hereat Sir Antheon smil'd, and said (in jest;) ‘Perhaps, if Apollonius, who profest ‘Strange sounds t'interpret, had but chanc'd to hear ‘How Huntsmen in these parts their Hounds doe chear, ‘He would have told us that their Hornes did say ‘At every blast, Euto, Eutopia. ‘But if this fair and happy region be ‘Not far from our Atlantis, certainely ‘'Tis such a floting Island, as 'tis said ‘That Delos was, till fixt and stablished. ‘For sometime (if my judgment do not faile) ‘It border'd upon Plato's Common-weale, ‘Famous in Greece, so far from us, that well ‘How great the distance is I cannot tell. ‘However your desire imports to me ‘A just command, besides an augury ‘Of good success; &amp; I your counsel weigh ‘As much as what a Senate-house can say: ‘Nor (having found you credible in all ‘Reports) can I your words in question call: ‘Your riper age, that has the world explor'd ‘Much more than mine, more knowledge doth afford. ‘Then let us cheerfully our selves address ‘(As at the first) to th' earnest business ‘Of ardent love, to seek that happy land, ‘And her that greater service may command. These speeches ended, to a Port they went, And for their own Atlantick vessel sent; A Ship that oft had wrastled with the Seas, And born up bravely in long voyages. When they had trimm'd it up in every joynt, Had seen it firm, complete in every point, And furnisht with provisions plenteous store, They boldly put off from the lazy shore Into the working Floud, that smil'd with fome, And proudly swell'd to see the vessel come. Through wildest vastities &amp; torrid'st Climes They past, sometimes bestorm'd, becalm'd sometimes; Sometimes with unseen rocks (that seem'd to bear A secret spight to them) they threatned were; Somtimes with swallowing gulfs, sometimes with sands Up-cast, and oft with Rovers from strange lands. Yet, as great Cæsars fortune they along Had with them took, they safely past among All dangers, safely to the largest Plain In Neptunes Empire came, the Southern Main. It was not long before they rack't the sand Of their Atlantis with their Keele; yet land They would not there, lest they too long should stay Ere they arriv'd at fair Eutopia. Having at last procur'd an abler Guide, And sail'd by his direction, they descry'd Somewhat that lookt as if a cloud had lain Upon the Sea; but soon appear'd more plain To be an Isle, the same that they had sought, And with hard paines a sight thereof had bought. The countrey seem'd of figure spherical, Embost with hills more beautiful than tall, Whose browes fresh woods engirt; the shadow'd vales Were here &amp; there with brooks (like silver Trails) Enbrightned; the rich soiles well-cultur'd state Render'd it chief of Islands Fortunate, They, safely landing, greatly joy'd to see A people form'd to fair civility, That shew'd themselves in mind and body sound, And had much knowledge with more vertue crown'd, Hating the names of injury &amp; strife, As bitter enemies to the sweetest life; So that good laws amongst them did indeed Scarce seem from evill manners to proceed, But rather from a wise forecast. They were (Like those of famous Sparta) so severe, That such as dar'd t' offend, were never spar'd, Nor was Desert ere cheated of reward. Hence liv'd they in such quietness, that they Might wel be neighbours to th' Pacificke-Sea; And happy were in such a high degree, That next to Heaven was their felicity. The Knight, whose sparkling courage clear'd his way, Went on with his design without delay; And as those motions which from Nature flow, Do towards their cessation swifter grow: So he now drawing nearer to his Love, With more alacrity did forward move. Under a hill, with Olive-arbours green, Amongst whose sprases was store of Turtles seen, Did stand an ancient Edifice, not gay, Nor vast, but strong and usefull every way; Such as whose very structure wrought th' effect In all beholders, of a fair respect: Humility had rais'd it, and there sate Full-handed Bounty smiling at the gate, Whilst fair Civility in every room, Took care of what might dignity become. It had for Prospect an extended Plain Towards the East, where Flora seem'd to reign In richest state: through this, Sir Antheon drew Up towards the Fabrick which he had in view: When meeting with a Passenger by th' way, An aged Sire, all (Pilgrime-like) in gray, He gently wisht him (if he could) to tell What person at that pleasant Seat did dwell. ‘Truly, said he, there shines in yonder place ‘A starlike Beauty, the great joy and grace ‘Of this whole coast; Fidelta is her name, ‘Whose worth would weary many-tongued Fame ‘Fully to sound it: her poor Bead-man I ‘Profess my self, and will do till I dye. The Knight (now rapt with joy, &amp; grown as light As Nisus felt himself, when first in flight He stretcht his wings) no more to hear would stay, But thither hasted where his Treasure lay. Arriv'd and enter'd there, he fed his sight A while with objects of no mean delight; Servants all clad in livery; a free Full house, yet void of fulsome luxury. A fire amidst the hall (most apt to show Pure charity) that did like Vesta's glow; All things i'th' old worlds fashion, plain but neat, So regular, substantial, and compleat, That (sure) he thought that happy Houshould could Not look with envy upon th' age of gold. Coming at last to th' presence of that rare Lady, whose beauty clear'd the circling aire, Whose eye-light, breath, &amp; virgin-blush, did show How starres do shine, Balme smells, &amp; Roses glow; As wonder-struck he stood, &amp; scarce could use His vocal faculty: so stands my Muse, And words doth want sufficiently to praise A beauty that transcends Hyperbole's; Which so attempt to reach with lofty strains, Her lowly mind forbids, and saves my pains. He found her with fine needle curiously Working Susanna's famous history In silk and gold; whose vernal beauty clear, And the hoary Elders wintry faces, were So artfully enlyv'd, that well they might Lead into errour a Beholders sight. But he a livelier and a lovelier Piece Admiring (more than Troy that Dame of Greece) His courtship thus began: Fair Governess ‘Of all the pow'rs your Servant doth possess! ‘Lady Angellical! most fit to move ‘And rule the Orb and influence of love! ‘I that to find your home have travelled ‘Farther than all that searcht for Nilus head, ‘From hardest exigents on Sea and Land, ‘Come now to kiss your soft Ambrosial hand, ‘And to demand as (hardly earned Hire) ‘Your true affections treasure, love entire. ‘The Magnetisme that in your vertues lies, ‘Drew me to this laborious enterprize, ‘Fame having far divulg'd your courtesy, ‘Noble beneficence, rare modesty, ‘Meekness, veracity, and many more ‘High notes of excellence, which I adore, ‘And with your person must the same possess, ‘Or fall full far short of long'd-for happiness. ‘Fair Sir, said she, if of my vertues you ‘Be so desirous, that you them pursue, ‘Then (if you can) those dear endowments take ‘As yours, but use them nobly for my sake; ‘Take those quaint jewels for your wondrous pains, ‘But leave the cabinet that them contains: ‘I shall not be disfurnisht, for we so ‘Fetcht flames from fire, which ner'theless will glow. ‘Perchance I make it my ambitious strife ‘To imitate Diana's single life; ‘Will you perst then to solicite me, ‘And like Orion, tempt my chastity? ‘What if my heart, drawn forth by such a charm ‘As your soft speech, anothers breast doth warm, ‘To whom I promis'd love? then without fruit ‘You labour spend, and frustrate is your suit. ‘For sooner shall some harsh collision crack ‘The whirling Spheres, and to a general wrack: ‘Hurry the world, than any force of Fate ‘Shall cause me my vow'd faith to violate: ‘Fortune may smile, and frown, and oft estrange ‘Her looks, but must not look my mind to change. ‘Madam, said he, your temper's not so hard, ‘That into it all entrance is debarr'd; ‘For as you spake, from my dilated heart ‘I did perceive some spirits to depart, ‘And fly int' yours; whence now they back retire, ‘To work in us an unitive desire. ‘My breast's inflam'd; yet my desire do I ‘Disdain to follow with the common cry ‘To pull for love, or come with poor intent ‘To beg a smile, or shew my languishment; ‘But to your beauties as bold claim to lay, ‘As Venus to the Doves that draw her, may, ‘Sith to unite our hearts the stars combin'd, ‘And to our Match the Destinies consign'd: ‘I saw you in a dream too; whence drew ‘Fair hopes that sometime I should sleep with you. ‘You little dream, said she, what envy I ‘Should draw upon you, should I not deny ‘What you desire; For many Knights whom arts ‘And arms ennobled, have from forraign parts ‘Repair'd and su'd to me, as Pilgrims go ‘On holier visits, and devotion show. ‘But I have either fled them, as they say ‘Daphne did Phœbus, or else sent away ‘Them with their suits, and caus'd them to depart ‘Sorely opprest with heaviness of heart; ‘Or into a passion chaf't, as flouds are more ‘Enrag'd, when meeting with a rocky shore. ‘But now that you more loveliness present, ‘I feel my rigid temper to relent; ‘And sith indeed you urge the will and law ‘Of mighty Fate, you needs must over-awe ‘My pow'r, and I must of my modesty ‘Crave leave to say I love you fervently: ‘Nor think it levity in me to say ‘So much, for I have learn'd my words to weigh. ‘Plain truth to tell, loud Fame has blown your worth ‘So far, and trumpeted your merits forth, ‘That you in your Atlantis to have seen ‘I purpos'd; as that Amazonian Queen, ‘Thalestris (though with more impure intent ‘Than mine) to'th Macedonian Monarch went. ‘Love, Theseus-like, a noted part did play, ‘Did through a Labyrinth it self convey, ‘Found passage through mine ear; though in at th' eye ‘(More slippery far) it slides most frequently. ‘However to the centre of my breast ‘With happy speed it went, and there shall rest: ‘Time that will break strong-hearted Oake, shall nere Crack that affection which to you I bear. After this sweet accord, this harmony Of voice and vote, they further did agree By Hymens hallowed lights all doubts to clear, And make their loves more sensible appear. Haste was requir'd; nor many dayes did passe Before what they desir'd accomplish't was With fairest auspice, every rite and dress That aptly symboliz'd their happiness. And as when Peleus was to take his deare Thetis to wife, the Gods invited were To th' marriage-feast: so persons eminent, Whom Fame had Heaven-ward in high praises sent For loyalty in love, must onely be The welcome Guests to this solemnity. Yet such true hearts these Islanders did bear, That faithful Lovers, like to culvers there In flocks did meet; who as their cups did flow, Turn'd Prophets, and full fortunes did fore-show To th' married Pair; while the air with musick rung, And nuptial hymnes inspired Poets sung. Thus now these worthy Lovers reacht the joyes That long had hover'd in their phantasies; Ioyn'd their loves forces, that (as gummes in fire With spices mixt) more sweetly did conspire; And blest their fates, that on them had bestow'd Such ample favours, as to few were show'd. High was their happiness, and scarce to be Reacht with the lines of loftiest poetry. The End.</field>
