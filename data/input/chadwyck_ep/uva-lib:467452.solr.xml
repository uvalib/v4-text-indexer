      <field name="fulltext">ADELMORN, THE OUTLAW. ACT THE FIRST. 1. CHORUS. [Bustle, boys! the Duke is near.] Bustle, boys! the Duke is near. MAURICE. Philip! Caspar! MEN SERVANTS. Here, sir, here! MAURICE. Strow some rushes! bring perfumes! Burn some myrrh, and scent the rooms: Lotta! Bertha! FEMALE SERVANTS. Here, Sir, here! MAURICE. Bustle all, the Duke is near. ORRILA. Cease, fond Herman, to upbraid me, Cease to tell your bosom's smart: HERMAN. Cease, proud fair one, to persuade me From your presence to depart. DUO. Other/Your bright eyes have captive made And must ever rule my heart. HUGO. Zounds! Who set the bells a ringing? Why must all this clatter be? Rascals! you so spoil my singing, Scarce I know F sharp from C! MAURICE. Leave us, leave us, master scraper, Come not here to scold and vapour! HUGO. Ha! A Duo Amoroso, But I fear, perform'd but so so! HERMAN. Dearest creature! HUGO. Not so ill! HERMAN. Every feature.......... HUGO. Now a trill! HERMAN. Makes me nurse the fond delusion, You will grant at length my boon; HUGO. Pray excuse this bold intrusion, But you sing quite out of tune. CHORUS. Pr'ythee, Hugo, leave your playing, Here you must not think of staying— HUGO. How their discords wound my ear! Louder!—softer!—slower!—faster! Can there be a worse disaster Than such horrid tones to hear? CHORUS. If our work proceeds no faster, Ere we half have done, our master Will conduct our sov'reign here. 2. SONG. [OLD Orpheus play'd] HUGO. [1.] OLD Orpheus play'd So well, 'tis said, That, whenever he touch'd his fiddle, Wild beasts and flocks, Streams, woods, and rocks, Danc'd about to his hey diddle diddle. Here figures out A tower so stout, There figures in a fountain; While a sea-port town The dance leads down, And goes back to back with a mountain. Sing tweedle-dum! At his strum strum strum Forests and fields cut capers; Sing tweedle-dee! Oh! was not he The prince of catgut scrapers? 2. See, ranged in pairs, Twelve dancing bears Go as fast as e'er they can-go; A lively pig Performs a jig, And a graceful goose a fandango: While an arm of the sea, Introduc'd by a tree, To a fair young whale advances, And, making a leg, Cries—“Miss, may I beg Your fin for the two next dances?” Sing tweedle-dum, &amp;c. 3. SONG. [LASSES, haste your hands to show me] LODOWICK. LASSES, haste your hands to show me, Haste, for mother Bedra's here: Skill'd in witchcraft, all who know me What my lips unfold revere. None my magic pow'rs deny: 'Tis not a lie, For here am I; If you doubt me, come and try. I by secret spells discover What the stars on earth intend: Have you lost a faithless lover, Have you found a perjur'd friend, I can make them pine and die: 'Tis not a lie, &amp;c. Miss, this charm gives information Who the silver goblet stole; If you've torn your reputation, Here's a spell can mend the hole. There's a secret!—Won't you buy? 'Tis not a lie, &amp;c. But be quick! three hours when counted, (And, alas! time flies so soon;) Must I, on a broom-stick mounted, Take my flight beyond the moon! Then too late you'll grieve and sigh: 'Tis not a lie, &amp;c. 4. SONG. [THE clock had toll'd “One!” all was silent and dread!] ORRILA. THE clock had toll'd “One!” all was silent and dread! When, lo! as I lay fast asleep in my bed, And long, for the loss of the lad who is fled, My pillow in tears had been steeping; Methought that in accents well known and most dear The voice of my lover sigh'd soft in my ear, —“Why sorrows my fairest? thy rover is here! “Sweet lass, are you waking or sleeping?”— I bade him begone; my reproaches were tart; He answer'd by pressing me close to his heart; Then, boldly protesting he would not depart, In spite of entreaties and weeping Still closer he clasp'd me!—'Twas here that I broke The thread of my dream; but as soon as I woke, I freely confess, the first words that I spoke Were—“Ah! have I only been sleeping?” 5. CHORUS. [HILLOA ho! hilloa ho!] MAURICE, HERMAN, AND HUNTERS. HILLOA ho! hilloa ho! The hollow woods echo with hilloa ho! MAURICE. The sun is shining, HERMAN. The air is sweet, MAURICE. Our spears are sturdy, HERMAN. Our darts are fleet, MAURICE. The hunters shout, HERMAN. And the caves repeat CHORUS. Hilloa ho! hilloa ho! The hollow woods echo with hilloa ho! 6. CHORUS. [THROUGH the forest cautious stealing] MAURICE, HERMAN, AND HUNTERS. THROUGH the forest cautious stealing, Friends, explore each vale and glen: Yonder shades the boar concealing, Rouse him from his secret den! Mark his eyes with fury flashing! Now his tusks revengeful gnashing, Wounded, on our band he rushes, While his blood in torrents gushes! Now his life is fast retreating; Now I hear his dying roar; While, the hunters' shouts repeating, Echo tells he breathes no more. END OF THE FIRST ACT. ACT THE SECOND. 1. GLEE. [WHY, Fortune, still do mortals pour] ORRILA, HERMAN, MAURICE. WHY, Fortune, still do mortals pour Their fervent vows thy shrine before, So vain, so weak thy power? Not all thy honours, all thy wealth Can give the cheek one blush of health, Or buy one peaceful hour! Still, Fortune, still thy gifts withhold, Thy flattering smiles, and cup of gold From me who fear thy favour: Those flattering smiles bring cares and woes; That cup of gold with tears o'erflows, And bitter is their flavour! Taken from a German Ballad.2. SONG. [HIS wings in terror clapping] HERMAN. HIS wings in terror clapping, A little bird, last May, Against my window flapping, For shelter seem'd to pray. With pity touch'd, I granted The little bird's request; It trembled, flutter'd, panted! I sooth'd it on my breast. Well pleas'd it seem'd to eye me: I lov'd the pretty thing: To keep it ever nigh me I clipp'd each little wing. But yet I thought, sincerely To go it would be griev'd: It seem'd to love me dearly: And oh! too well deceiv'd, Its wings by me neglected, Again their feathers grew, And ere I aught suspected One morn away it flew, Crying—“That yours the blame is, Poor youth, too late you learn; So sure as Love my name is I never will return!”— 3. SONG. [WHAT detains him? Ah! why stays he?] ORRILA. WHAT detains him? Ah! why stays he? Glow-worms, guide his footsteps here! 'Midst what dells and dingles strays he? Friendly moon, my pilgrim cheer! Lo! where gleam yon lights deluding, Oft the Fire-king walks the round; Fogs and vapours there hang brooding, Bid him shun the fatal ground! What detains, &amp;c. Where the serpent lurks discover, Warn him where the pit-fall lies; Let not danger harm a lover, Who with faithful passion sighs. What detains, &amp;c. 4. CANTATA. [MY Love! My Love!—oh! gentle zephyrs, say] HUGO. RECITATIVE [Accompanied]. MY Love! My Love!—oh! gentle zephyrs, say, Did Theseus, godlike Theseus, walk this way? But oh, ye Gods! what object shocks mine eyes? Swift thro' the waves his distant vessel flies; To leave me here the rogue's intention sure is:— Oh! rage, distraction, vengeance, fire and furies! ARIA. Return, return, false youth, I pray, Return to your Infanta: Alas! you fly, and bear away My heart, and my portmanteau! Ah! if forced yourself to leave me, Why of all my clothes bereave me? Why, alone, desert me here? Surely there had been no sin in Leaving me a change of linen, And a tall, stout grenadier. I'm seized by distraction, my brain sure is turning, My blood is in flames, and my bosom is burning. Love's arrow, transfixing My bosom, now sticks in My gizzard, and makes it with agony fry! I'll heed, in my fury, Nor justice, nor jury: So either I'll fly Post-haste to the sky, Or plunge in the flames of Mount Ætna and die, Ætna and die, Ætna and die, Or plunge in the flames of Mount Ætna, and die. 5. DUET. [Foul, fair] [The Words by George Colman, Esq.] ORRILA AND LODOWICK. Foul, fair, Orrila willingly Round the world with you/me will ride; O rare! You will/I shall look killingly On a post-horse by your side. LODOWICK. Whip, crack! Spurring and cantering We shall thro' the mud be dash'd; Good lack! I shall be bantering When two pretty legs are splash'd. ORRILA. Fie, fie, Lodowick! That's a saucy trick. Nought shall part us though, LODOWICK. No,—no,—no ORRILA. In spite of weather then We'll together then— BOTH. Bantering, Cantering, Splattering, Clattering. BOTH. Foul, fair, &amp;c. &amp;c. ORRILA. Heigho! Drearily, wearily, We shall reach our Inn at night. LODOWICK. If so, Merrily, cheerily, We can sup by candle-light. ORRILA. Rooms full; bedding will fail us—then LODOWICK. In these arms you'll sleep at ease; ORRILA. Meat gone—What's to regale us then? LODOWICK. Kisses sweet and bread and cheese. ORRILA. Fie, fie, saucy man! That's a silly plan, Nought shall part us though, &amp;c. 6. BALLAD. [“THE wind it blows cold, and the night it is drear.] INNOGEN. “THE wind it blows cold, and the night it is drear. “Oh! porter, tell Gondibert Minna is here.”— —“Away, thou fond wench, nor excite these alarms “A bride sleeps to-night in Sir Gondibert's arms.”— —“And was it for this, from my parents I fled? “Then, porter, tell Gondibert Minna is dead; “And tell him, though grief for his loss caus'd her death, “While blessing his name, that she pour'd her last breath.”— And now the gay morning bade Gondibert rise: Oh! soon a sad object afflicted his eyes! Poor Minna lay breathless his castle before; He sank on her bosom, and never rose more. 7. CHORUS. [OH! raise that drooping head!—restrain thy sorrow!] OH! raise that drooping head!—restrain thy sorrow! Thine evil star shall set for aye to-morrow: With mercy must the Duke thine anguish view, For none unmoved hear weeping beauty sue. TRIO. MAURICE, HERMAN, ELLA. Thou, in whom alone our trust is, Mercy! hear the mourner's prayer; Blunt the lifted axe of Justice, Bid the stern-one feel, and spare. CHORUS. Though o'er the frighted world now tempests hover, Soon will the skies their wonted calm recover: So may to-morrow sooth thy tortured breast, Smooth thy sad brow, and lull thy cares to rest. END OF THE SECOND ACT. ACT THE THIRD. 1. CHORUS [Guiltless sufferer, cease to sorrow] Guiltless sufferer, cease to sorrow; Care from thy sad heart dismiss: When thine eyes unclose to-morrow, Wake to life, and live to bliss. Clouds around the Phantom lour! Vengeance, 'tis thy fated hour, Pealing thunders speak it near. See, he struggles! vain endeavour! See, he dies, he's lost for ever! Mortals, view his fate, and fear! Now from earth his flight addressing, Upwards see the spirit move: Youth, receive his parting blessing, Pledge of pardon, pledge of love. Sweet his angel-accents swell: Adelmorn, farewell, farewell! 2. DUO. [FROM him I love compell'd to sever]HERMAN AND ORRILA. [1.] ORRILA.FROM him I love compell'd to sever, I mourn with tender fears opprest. HERMAN.I fruitless find each fond endeavour To warm my fair one's frozen breast. DUO.Yet, Love, my heart still thine shall be, And while it throbs, shall throb for thee.2. ORRILA.Let prudes, their fonder thoughts concealing, With clamours loud thy joys decry. HERMAN.Let Stoics, dead to generous feeling, Thy power deride, thy charms deny. DUO.My pride shall be, while life remains, To wear, and kiss thy roseate chains. 3. SONG. [MY grief and my hunger I fain would impart] LODOWICK. 1 MY grief and my hunger I fain would impart; But, ye walls, I want language to tell ye How full of affliction I feel my poor heart, How empty of food my poor belly! Oh deign, some kind angel, to bring me relief! Descend in the shape of a round of salt beef, Well garnish'd with cabbage and carrot! And if for my woes, from your eyelids divine, Tears should fall, be the drops not of water, but wine, And weep me a bottle of Claret. 2 Thin ghosts of fat Abbots, be mov'd by my pray'r, And pity my starving condition! I vow what I ask is no mighty affair, So I hope that you'll grant my petition! I sue not in flames as a martyr to die, And sure as a saint to be perch'd up on high Would be glory too great for a sinner: I only request, my dear ghosts, just to go, With a stomach well lin'd, to the regions below, And, previous to death, go to dinner. 4. BALLAD The idea of this Ballad is taken from one in a French opera called “Les Femmes et Le Secret.”. [A WOLF while Jutta slept had made]ORRILA. 1 A WOLF while Jutta slept had made Her favourite lamb his prize; Young Casper flew to give his aid, Who heard the trembler's cries. He drove the wolf from off the green, But claim'd a kiss for pay; Ah! Jutta, better 't would have been, Had Casper staid away. 2 While grateful feelings warm'd her breast, She own'd she lov'd the swain; The youth eternal love profess'd, And kiss'd and kiss'd again. A fonder pair was never seen; They toy'd the live-long day: Ah! Jutta, better 'twould have been, Had Casper staid away. 3 At length the sun his beams withdrew; And, night inviting sleep, Fond Jutta rose, and bade adieu, Then homewards drove her sheep: Alack! her thoughts were chang'd, I ween, For thus they heard her say: —“Ah! Jutta, better 'twould have been, “Had Casper staid away.” 5. GLEE. [SAILOR-BOY! sailor-boy! sleep, my sweet fellow] HUGO, ORRILA, HERMAN, AND MAURICE. [1.] SAILOR-BOY! sailor-boy! sleep, my sweet fellow, O'er your rock'd vessel though thunder-bolts roll: Wild though the ocean raves, loud though winds bellow, Calm be your bosom, for pure is your soul. Hushaby! Hushaby! poor sailor-boy! Let not the tempest your slumbers destroy; No terrors of conscience your bosom annoy, Then Hushaby! Hushaby! poor sailor boy! 2. Sailor-boy! sailor-boy! Danger not bringing Home to your thoughts crimes committed before, Tost on rough seas, in a narrow cot swinging, Safer you sleep than a villain on shore. Hushaby! &amp;c. 6. CHORUS. [HARK! the bell tolls! the sinner's course is ending!] HARK! the bell tolls! the sinner's course is ending! Sad swells the hymn, and tears obscure the sight! Rise, pious pray'rs! pure sighs to Heav'n ascending, Waft the repentant soul to realms of light. 7. FINALE. [THE storm is o'er, the sky is clear] HERMAN. THE storm is o'er, the sky is clear, And past our consternation, Our hero now has nought to fear But your disapprobation. The Outlaw trembling waits to hear What sentence ye will give, sirs: Decree his death, or set him clear; Say, shall he die or live, sirs? CHORUS. The Outlaw, &amp;c. ORRILA. Ye married dames, who grace the house, A wondrous tale I'll tell ye: Though left three years without my spouse, I liv'd like chaste Penelly. Then, all ye wives your Lords who love, To me be well-intention'd; So clap your hands like mad, and prove Ye all are. . . .what I mention'd. CHORUS. The Outlaw, &amp;c. LODOWICK. That storm came mighty a-propos: But now the play is ended, I hope, around, above, below, To find the weather mended: For thunder in this atmosphere Great consternation causes, Save when from hand and voice we hear A thunder of applauses. CHORUS. The Outlaw, &amp;c. THE END.</field>
