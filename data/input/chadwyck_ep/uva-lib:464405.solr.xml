      <field name="fulltext">TO THE HONORABLE, LORD GILBERT TALBOT, SONNE AND HEIRE TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, THE EARLE of Shrevvsbury, Knight of the most noble order of the Garter. &amp;c. Increase of honour, and all felicitie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Golden Mirrours, verie significatiue and pithie: with Uerses vpon the Etimologie of the names of sundrie Noblemen and Gentlemen. [When as the Stately Stagge doth haunt the mountaine toppe] When as the Stately Stagge doth haunt the mountaine toppe, And secretlye doeth doubt, the Hunters subtill sleight: To Maxfield forrest, with weary steppes I got, And Shutlings loe, did scale of monstrous height: Where fominge brynish flouds in th'occident I see, And sixe sundry Shyres appeared vnto mee. Thus gasing in the cloudes, these countreys far to vew, Meete vnderneath, the mountaine where I was: The keepers came, the Stagg for to pursue, With bended bowes, and grayhounds, more and lesse. And Gentlemen, with Gentlewomen braue: That thether came, a huntyng sport to haue. But or the Course was set, tyme ware a way apace, And Boreas breth was blacke, and glummish chill: Which caused me, to seeke a warmer place, Underneath a rocke, on the other side the hill: Where houres three, I am sure that I sette, And watcht for sport, vntill I fell a sleepe. And in this slumbring sleep, the richest Dreame I had, A sight of blasing blisse, and glorious Golden show: I sawe a virgin, in rich attire clad, Whose vertues causde all men her name to know: For fame did sounde her iust deserued prayse, Whose giftes of grace, her Royall race bewrayes, A Rose as Ruby red, sprang in this Ladyes hand, Whose fragrant tast, perfum'd the loftie aire: Three Crownes vpon the same, by right did stand, Three Princely Lyons, this (Lady) honored there: The flower deluces did bow vnto the earth, Which did declare a Prince of famous byrth. And in a galland garden, stood this famous Dame, Inuironde round, with brynish waltring waues: With mightie mountaines, vaunting in the same, And riuers fresh, through valleys passadge craues: Where springs doe spoute, whose siluer streams doe gush, Through ribs of rockes, them selues doe dayly push. Many Cities buylt of fame, and honour great, Of worship, worthy Townes, of riche and manly shoe: Wherein me thought, was Iulius Cæsars seate, With stately buyldings, many thousands moe: Of comely creatures, so populous to view, The like was neuer seene, if euery one were trewe. Of wealth there was no want, but grace there wanted some, Will playd such wicked partes, and priuate gayne: That in this garden, the poore men seldome wonne, And yet there durst not one of them complayne: The litle fish still flieth from the whale, Yet what's deuoured, God Neptune knowes not all. Then came Morpheus with Linces eyes, in his fist Which sparkled like the fire, among the cloudy skies: Hold these (sayd he) and see what ere thou list, Nothing can be vnknowen vnto the wise: Which when I had, but present in my hand, I heard and saw, but scarse could vnderstand. But by the blasing beames, of Lynces eyes, I sawe much more, then Argos many away: And heard report, what wordes from him there flies, And who they were, that did this dame obay: So did I view a vyle and wicked brood, That lately dranke, of vglie stigian floud. From out whose mouthes, they belched bulles of lead, Which rored and beld, in th'eares of some by sleight: A foxe their sier, a wolfe their supreame head, Their frendes are traiters, I know not what they hight: Thus still I stood, these nouelties rare to view, And warely watcht to see what would insewe. And as I standing there, to see the same, Dropt into doubtfull dumps, of that and this: Upon the sodden presently there came, A valiant hounde, as white as siluer is: And did behold this Lady in the face, As one right ready, to obay her grace. Streight came an Eagle, soring in the skyes, With Golden fethers, delighting all mens sight: Who stooping straight, fell downe vpon his knees, To doe his duetie, thus he left his flight: (And sayd) Madame, the Lord preserue thee still, Thus doe I pray and haue, and euer will. This Hound and Eagle, with foote and wing so prest, In sure seruice vnto this excellent Dame: Those that had dronke of Stigian could not rest, But by the one or other straight was ta'en: No Bull durst bell, neare where there byding was, This noble Hound, no craftie Foxe let passe. A voyce I heard, that all the world did heare, That thundered from, the golden trumpe of fame: And true report him selfe, was present there, And made a challenge, to performe the same: The wordes were these, the Lyon well may trust, That Hound and Eagle, that neuer were vniust. They both be ready, alwayes for to obey, The Prince and Lawes, they truely loue in heart: No blotte of blame, from first vnto this day, Their banners blanckles, of any euill part: Their seruice showes, they sprang of spotles race, As at these dayes, appeareth by their grace. And with these wordes, the voyce was ceast and gone, And at the gase I gastly quaking stood: Birdes, beast and foules, in flockes was many a one, Whereas a number, seem'd of Uipers blood: (I iudge yt so) because they sought the spoyle, Of none so much, as of their natiue soyle. Then looking vp and downe, both heere and there, To heare report: and vewe with Lynces eyes: Me thought that Iupiter, descended from the ayre, A midd a shower, of siluer droppes he flies: And Saturne followed, with his chollericke looke, And furious Mars, his blade, about him shooke. Then Mischief calde, for (treason vndertrust) Helpe now (quoth he) or els I am ore' throwen: Then sayd Iupiter, thou wretched Theefe vniust, I am the God, that makes such villaines knowen: For treason thou, shalt reape thy iust rewarde, And I this Uirgin, in prosperous raigne will garde. Then Eccho, she was cald, that liues in woodes, And rocky ragged tours, and Dales with Dymbles deepe: Where riuers runne with waltring waues in floudes, For that (that she) could neuer counsell keepe: Sayd Iupiter, come Eccho, vnto mee, Reueile all those these dayes that traitors bee. But at this word me thought a number fled, Some others wishte them fishes in the Sea: An other sorte began to hyde their head, And many other did ambodexter play: For Eccho did all traytors trades bewray, As Iupiter commaunded, so she did obey. Thus Eccho charg'd to tel all things that's hard, Iupiter commaunded woodes, waters hilles, and dales: Mountaines, medowes and valleys to regarde, With cabbins and caues in England and in Wales: What people they receiue, sith vipers be abrod, That neither honor Prince, ne yet almightie God. Except you know them, stay them all (quoth hee) He charg'd the stones to tell that lye in street: So did the Eagle to all the foules that flee, Commaunded them to watch, with whom they meete, That by your voyce the Serpents may be knowen: That seeke to haue our (onely ioy) ore throwen. And prest accomplere, sayd the noble Hound, With sterne and stately countenance all about: (All enemies) what soeuer to confound, My present seruice shall put you out of doubt: In place my person, shall the triall make, If any enemy dare, approche the state. Then Neptune rousde him selfe vpon a rocke, Amid the brynish fomyng floudes he sate: The gates of all his pallace did vnlocke, And send for Triton, his pleasure to relate: Whose trompet soundeth euer in the seas, For to declare such newes, as Neptune please. When Triton came, and had his duetie done, God Neptune bad him sound his trumpet vp: And in the seas commaunde all creatures come, That of the fomyng floudes did drinke or sup: And tell Caribd and Silla I am here, And doe commaunde them, presently appeare. Triton trudg'd and sounded Trumpet straight, At voice wherof, appeared great and small: The Seas did mount of mightie monstrous height, All liuing creatures attended on the Whale. A mightie muster I neuer saw the like, It passeth all my skill the halfe for to indite. When all assembled weare before this God, Triton sounded science in paine of present death, And then came Mercurie to charme them with his rod: That none durst speake that time that beareth breath: Thus silence made, quoth Neptune now prepare My pleasure to fulfil, that here my Subiectes are. Said Neptune, sith to yon it's not vnknowen, But that on Tellus all my floods do stay: On whom I reape the fruites, on earth that's sowen, And doe maintaine my state both night and day. He sends me word that Uipers are abord, That would destroy th'annointed of the Lord. Which Ladies vertue mooueth all the Gods. As Iupiter himselfe for to defend the skies: And to prepare for all her foes such rods, As Iustice can by any law deuise. So that her Foes on earth cannot escape, Mark now said Neptune what I will debate, Then for Eolus, Triton sound his Trump, Who presently did personally appeare: who was vpon the sodaine in a dump, Till Neptune tolde him softly in his eare. Which when he knew, what was the cause in deed, He willingly with Neptune did proceede. And then said Neptune, I charge my furious Flouds, To swell and rage, vp toward the cloudie skies: With greedy Iawes deuoure vp their bloods, That harme against her noble state deuise. To thee Caribdis and Sylla, thus I will, That night and day their ships and them you spill. Then said Eolus with a blustering blast, I for my part shal make their course but short: I will breake Anker, Cable, and also Mast, So that destruction shall acquite their sport. But whom (said Eolus) that it pleaseth you, I'le blowe his sailes, the Traitors to pursue. And as this word, Eolus mouth had past, God Neptune musing whom to choose therefore: The mightie Iupiter sendeth with a blast A faithfull Foule, for seas none like of rore. A Drake adrest to passe through euery storme, To swim the flouds, this Uirgins foes to charme. Then stept out Nature that secretly lay hid, And did auouch the choice was by her made: And Mars himselfe to take the charge did bid, And there withall did giue this Drake his blade: And Neptune bad him welcome to the Seas, Eolus promist him to blow hys sayles alwayes. And when this valiaunt Drake receiued charge, And to the purpose as before I sed: And his commission reachyng wide and large, Me thought some foes farre of, hoist sailes and fled: An other sorte to Crikes began to flye, Because they knew they had deserued to dye. But Drake not dreading, layde to his brest to swym, The fomyng flouds to search for forrain foes: The Gods in all exploits were still with him, And Eolus in his sayles, a luckie blast still blowes: No foe he feares though he can Spanish speake, He venters if they byde, their force to breake. And as I kend him farre, as eyes could scry, And all his faithfull followers at that tyme: A warlike Winter, appeared in the sky, Yet Phebus frendly did vpon them shine: Eolus Furbisher, was ready for to scower, The Spanish cloud, that mischief meant to power. And seeing a sight my eyes began to tyre, With flouds so furious, and eke so many sayle: Streightwayes I heard, and saw such gunnes on fire, The tremblyng earth, my feete began to fayl: The skies were dimd, the Seas of fire flamd, As though this word Rise Deadmen had bene nam'd. Foes fled that could, some sanke into the Seas, The rest prisoners that crau'd of Drake their life: An other sorte sought boggs and woods for ease, Thus Neptunes Drake, by force doth stinte their strife: The Gods of this Drake, doe make such a treasure, That Sancta Dominga he had at his pleasure. Thus fire and smoke, dasht Drake out of my sight, But that I heard for ioye the Sirens sing: And that I had a glimring of some light, Els of this Drake, no other newes I bring: But surely the Gods, the helme doo hold, Where Drake doth swym: what needeth more be told. Then turnde I backe, this garden for to view, For Morpheus twitcht me sharply by the eare: And sayd it's best, thy charge to looke vnto, And with thy pen, let diligence appeare: Now shalt thou see (quoth he) a happy sight, And comfort that, among the poore doth light. Whereat I ready for to view the same, A number infinite, did presently behold: That did reioyce, to heare of vipers tane, That sought such mischief, as before I told: With singing, ringing and clapping handes they sayd, God saue our Noble Queene, our mother and a mayd. The younglinges leape, like lambes vpon the leyes, The lame reioyst, and laught, to heare the newes: The poore ploughmen, vnyokt, and present playes, The traueller, his iorney doth refuse: And all with chearefull voyce did sing and pray, God saue our Noble Queene Elizabeth alway. The prayers of the poore, did pearce the skyes, The ioy of the people, spread ouer all the earth: The vertues of the virgin, throughout all kingdomes flyes, For all her faithfull subiectes, vnfainedly made mirth: Poore clout-shooes gate their clubs, and willingly attend, To wreke there mistres cause, both life and good will spend. The noyse whereof, so sounded in the ayre, And with the roring cannons on the sea: That heauen and earth, in euery part might heare, How nigh soeuer, or els how farre away: The thumping of the same so frighted me, That on the mount I wakened where I ley. My limmes be numde, as cold as any stone, And Phœbus bathing in the Occident floud: I could not stand when as I would haue gone, My ioynts were frosen, congeled was my bloud: Dismounting thus the hill, I did retyre, To maister Leigh of Ridge, a Gentle Squyre. To whom I told my Dreame, both more and lesse, From first vnto the last in eche degree: Who wished me, my pen, for to adresse, To set it downe, that all the world might see: God saue the Queene, (said he) the Eagle, and Noble hound, And all that traytors be, almightie God confound. Amen (quoth I) and he that would not so, I wish he were the first, to feele deserued woe. FINIS. [The Godesse chast, that Dian hath to name] The Godesse chast, that Dian hath to name, Is much abus'd by vermin that deuoure: In forrest, park, and chace, her galland Game Is vexed sore, and daungered euery houre: Which causeth her, to send for sure Hounds, To hunt the wolues, out of her Stately Grounds. When as Aurora with rudie cheekes prepard, Her Oriental pallace Phœbus to receiue: The Christall skyes, vnto the earth declard, That Flora would restore, what Hyemps did bereue: Which caused birds to brush, them on the bowes, And many for to walke, their chambers did refuse. And I my selfe then weary of my booke. To be partaker of the pleasant ayre: Into a forrest fast by the way I tooke, Wherein my sight, did hautie hills appeare: And rocky towers, did scale the loftie skyes, Whom vnderneath, deepe dales and dymbles lyes. Thus for to feede my gredy eyes at gaze, By wandring long I weary was at last: Till sodenly, my witts were in a maze, My eyes did dazile, and all my sense was past: I set me downe, a while to rubbe my browes, The poore Knights pallace of pleasure to peruse. But in a dreame or trance, that tyme I was, As did appeare, by sightes I see full rare: I heard such hunting of hounds both more and lesse, That scarse I can, the twenteth part declare: And euery hound, was called by his name, The Hunters hallowing did declare the same. The ragged hills and rocky towers reporte, By Ecchoes, voyce, the quest of Noble hounds: The which to heare, it was a worthy sporte, The merry voyce from earth to skyes rebounds: The Goddesse, Nymphes, with speedy foote doe follow, With sounde of merry horne, most plesantly they hallow, Thus as I heard this heauenly hunting there, I parted from the place, where then I sat: To haue a sight, of that which I did heare, Up higher the hill, with expedition gat: Where vnder a bush, not farre where I did stand, I saw a Nymphe with bended bow in hand. Whose presence then I durst not well approch, Her strange attire, and sparkling lookes were such: But closly kept me vnderneath a roch, Because harme haunteth some for medling much: Thus as I stood to heare this merry quest, I heard the names of houndes that hunted best. The followers chear'd the houndes with mery voyce, With pleasant notes of worthy warbling horne: And cald vpon the houndes that were of choyce, Who leade no chawle, the game they found so warme: And many houndes of sundry names there where, Of mightie mouthes, so did their sound apeare. I heard the hunts-man, call on duetie still, Obedience raung'd, from duetie quite away: Pleasure he ran riot, with his fellow will, Rufler rudely rou'd, and would no whit obey: Loue well found the perfit, whereat the hunts-man blew, And sayd, here Talbot, take it, for thou art euer trew. Bowman bruisht the brakes, through thicke and thin, Diligence followed dutie, with merry open mouth: Yet scarse could duetie bring obedience in, He was so rudely raung'd ore farre into the south: The hunts-man neuer ceast, but hallowed still and blew, And sayd, here Talbot, take it, for thou art euer trew. Finde all, and hold fast, both hunted together, Through thicke and thin, both night and day: Reuell and ringwood spared no weather, Ouer hills and dales, they take the way: Whereat the hunts-man, both hallowed and blew, And sayd, here Talbot, take it, for thou art stil trew. Talbot, treasure and trustie, followed duetie fast, And loue wel laboured lustily night, day, and houre: The hunts-man did rechat, with horne a merry blast, Dianas Nymphes did follow with al their might and power: Thus one, or other, neuer seast but blew, And cride, here Talbot, take it, for thou was euer trew, These hounds hunte together, with a gallant quest, But that Mendall was behind aboue a myle or more: And fauor hunted counter, with diuers of the rest, Which marde some sport, beshrow their harts therfore: But to the trusty hounds the hunts man hallowed still &amp; blew, And sayd, here Talbot, take it, for thou art euer trew. The wolfe, and foxe, both fled before the hounds, The beastly belling bull, lay coucht in cabbin closse: And wicked weesels, fled from Britanian grounds, The tygar trudgeth, dayly to his losse: The hounds quest merrily, the hunts-man euer blew, And sayd, here Talbot, take it, for thou art euer trew. The concord of their cry and merry quest, Caus'd al the hills, and mountaines to reioyce: The rocky woods, recordes both East and West, To euery eare, the noble pleasant voyce: The Nymphes let arrowes flee, and still the hunts-man blew, And sayd, here Talbot, take it, for thou art euer trew. Thus ouer hills and dales, these hounds did mount, Diana in her chariot, followed very fast Till to the quirry, a number out of count, Were brought to reape their iust reward at last. Where presently, the Mort the Hunts-man blew, And said, here Talbot, take it, for thou art euer trew. The heads and quarters of these Carrens vile I did beholde, where kites and Crowes did eate, A marke for many that do themselues exile From Dueties doctrine, and deale by deepe deceit. For by this same it doth appeare full well, That sacred Gods of euerie thing can tell. The heauens did declare a ioyfull time, By christall skies, and Phœbus golden gleimes: The Larke aloft into the cloudes doth clime, And euery Hunter, his wished pray obtaines. Till at the length, away the Hunts-man blew, And said, that noble Talbot euermore was trew. This heauenly hearing so delighted me, I wisht this hunting last for euermore: Most pleasant dreame it was that ere I see, But loe, what lucke did light (alas) therefore, A friend of mine by chance that way did passe, And wakened me, asleepe where then I was. FINIS. Verses pend vpon the Etimologie of the name of the right honorable, Fardinando, Lord Strange. Fame in her flight, by chance found me Asleepe vpon a banke, And in a furie, said that she Would yeeld me litle thanke, To sleepe when thou shouldst wake, and write, Sith I (said she) wil now indite. Arise (quoth she) write after me, My sentence doe not change, Here shalt thou view a creature true, Who may be called Strange. And if thou learned be quoth shee, Beholde the noble Wight: Whose modest minde apeares to be A wise and vertuous Knight: Descent of noble Parentage, And rarest creature of his age: A man so fixt and firme of fayth, That neuer yet did change, And standes to trueth for life or death, This man is very Strange: Recorded is his life by mee, Within my house of fame: From age to age his memorie Shall still aduance his name. (Quoth she) because his noble giftes Doe put his equals to their shiftes Let poore men iudge, that want refuge, That find their Landlords change, He takes th'olde rent, and is content: Which may be called Strange. Doubtlesse (quoth Fame) thou maist be bolde To write what I shall say: Strange is his vertues to beholde, Among the rest this day: He serueth God in humble wise, His Princes foes he doth dispise. His lowly minde men euer finde, Still fixed not to change. Which winnes mens harts in euery parts, And that must needes be straunge. Esteemde he is, of Noble Prince, And of all gentle blood: His like before his tyme, nor since, For vertuous giftes and good: I neuer knew, nor neuer shall, Though I to mynde with pen should call: All histories of auncient age, Yet I should finde some chaunge: His part he playes vpon the stage, Exceedeth very Straunge. No pride perceiued in his brest, No hautie heart he beares: And where is neede, to helpe vs prest, And thus he spends his yeares: No harme to any hath he wisht, Nor for a poore mans profite fisht: Doubtles his life, to man and wife, Doth show in him no chaunge: But sure, eche houre vnto his power, Among the rest, is Straunge. Of worldly wealth, he makes no coumpt, He wayes his honor more: Loue to his seruants doth surmount, And to his tenaunts poore: Of countrey still, he taketh care, And for the common wealth prepare: Remembring well, that fame will tell, What people loue to chaunge: Therfore I say, this present day, He may be called Straunge. Death doubts he not, in Princes causes, So true of faith is hee: To serue and prosecute her lawes, He cares not who they bee: Refusing neither night nor day, All tydes, and tymes, he takes the way: No fauor feare, no frend, nor foe, Can cause his mynde to chaunge, No gayne nor payne, can tempt him so, And that is very Straunge. If I should make report (quoth Fame) Of halfe his golden giftes: Except that Tullie were thy name, Thy pen were put to shiftes: Go to therfore, and write (sayd she) And I therewith abroad will flee: And euery eare, of him shall heare, That neuer yet did chaunge: But sure as rocke, and all his stocke, And that is onely Straunge. He loueth men, much more then sheepe, That some doe most delite: He pities people poore that weepe, When wrong hath wrought them spite: He gently heares their greeued causes, And doth with iustice vse the lawes: By force he wayes no wight with power, Nor mynde, with winde doth chaunge: As many doe this presente houre, But now that is not straunge. Not markes and pounds, but hawkes and hounds, Is euer his desire: He layes not gether poores mens grounds, He is no countrey stroyer: He liues in loue, of rich and poore, Sufficient he doth call his store: Full well knowes he, that men must dye, And therefore will not chaunge: But liues content, with auncient rent, Which argues to be Straunge. Thus did I write, and Fame indite, Me thought that present tyme: For in the sense, I had delite, To studie euery line: Loe this in sleepe, me thought I heard, Of Fame, which bad me take regard: With painefull pen, to tell all men, That it might neuer chaunge: Then out of sight, she tooke her flight, And bad me thinke of Straunge. Then wakened I, with weeping eyes, To call my Dreame to mynde: Because I see, such men as these, In England hard to finde: Alas therefore, what should I say, It is the cause poore men decay: Uice taketh place, for want of grace, So many loue to chaunge: Thus haue I pen'd, and also end, My Dreame of Noble Straunge. FINIS. Verses penned vpon the Etimologie of the Name and Title of the right vvorshipfull Lady, the Lady Iulian Holcraft of the Vale Royall. The head which still with studie is opprest, Of force must finde, some way to ease the same: All trauellers must haue a tyme to rest, Or els their limmes, with wandring wilbe lame: So I a weary sitting at my booke, Into the fieldes to walke the way I tooke. High on a hill to mount I did delite, To view a Royall Uale, that was below: Where riuers run, with streams as christall white, And pleasant woods, about the same did show: Wherein did bounse the Buck, with Hart, &amp; Hynd, The Faulconer ther for hawkes, may pastime finde. Eche spray was sprouted out with buds, Upon the which Merula singeth sweet: The Ro Bucke roreth in the shrubs, The fertill medowes, tast of flowers sweet: Which vapurs did perfume the starry skyes, That from this vale so Royally doth rise. Loe thus bewrapt in viewing this prospect, The sight I see, my sense so ouer threw: The christall streames, my eyes had so reflect, The ioy thereof my iudgement ouerthrew: That downe I sate to studie at the same, Till Morpheus had my drowsie head ore' tane. And thus a sleepe to me approched neare, A gallant Dame, presenting great renowme: Which sayd arise thou slugg, why sleep'st thou here. Come goe with me, where thou shalt haue a roome: I looked vp and did Melponia see, I rose and crau'd, her pardon on my knee. Doubtles (quoth he) at Helicon thou art, (Recorded thee) where thou shalt still remayne: But yet moe counsell take before we part, In hast prepare, thy pen for to proclayme The vertuous life, a Lady leadeth here, As dayly shall by iuste reporte appeare. In lasting letters, pen this Saras gift, Whose mildnes may full well Rebecca teach: And Rachels vertues, all would put to shift, The steps she treades no lyuing wight can rech: From blooming youth, vnto these present dayes, Of Alcest, she: doth iustly beare the kayes. In heart so meeke with spotles thought is she, That wordes in wast, be banisht from her brest: No idle looke once glanceth from her eyes, The poore mans plaints, to heare her eares are prest: Her liberall hand, doth hungry belly fill, Who wants her helpe, she is their comfort still. Unto her frend, as sure, as marble rocke, To foe not yelding, but as reason will: Of speaches she, both beares the key and locke, In (tyme) to vse all things, she hath the skill: In iudgement she can play Apollos part, A Goddesse she might be, for lerned art. Liue she doth, in loue of rich and poore, Her race so rarely run, hath not bene knowen: Her lampe of light, thus burneth euermore, With newes thereof, loe Fame her trump hath blowen, At Hespias, in chaire of state this Dame Hath cheefest place, for to aduance her name. In worldly stormes she beares her sailes so well, No suddaine blast can worke her any wracke, From out her presence vice she doth expell, And Uertue yet would neuer see him lacke: Her iust deserued praise shee doth not seeke, She is so humble, and lowly in her sprite. And to the stranger still she hath regard, To showe such courtesie as worship craues: Her neighbors cause with her is euer heard, Lo thus this Lady still her selfe behaues. She beares no minde that soreth in the skie, Nor yet too lowe she lifteth not to flie. Not cankered Enuie can these words deny, If Spite should speake, he must declare the same: For Uertue vaunts her name into the skie, With golden Trumpet, sounded vp by Fame, Would God therefore her daies should euer last, Then might a number think their sorrowes past. Her blossomes breede the fruites of noble state, Whose tast doth comfort rich and poore these daies By Natures works, of God these giftes they gate That euery wight should iustly speak her praise: At Helicon the Muses do delight: With golden pen this Ladies life to write. Of many vertues moe: I could declare, To occupie thy pen, if Tully were thy name: That wanting Tyme I am compeld to spare, Behold Sir Phœbus doth confesse the same: For now he batheth in the Occean Sea, Which is the cause I must depart away. Looke now therefore, thy pen doe witnesse beare, Melpomen said, for so thy duetie is: And make report what thou of me doest heare, And tell the world that I commaund thee this. For Iustice euermore hath this regard, That euery creature reape their due reward, Doubt neither friend nor foe to speak a trueth, Consider thou art bound by duetie much. Remember Time will bring all things to prooffe, And sith it doth thus much thy credite touch, For to discharge thy selfe from bearing blame, Thy pen I wish to write vpon this Dame. And with these wordes she vanished away, And I did wake foorth of this pleasant dreame, The night was come, and banisht was the day, The cloudes obscur'd Dianas face with raine. Then to my studie straight I did prepare, This Ladies words Melpomen so declare. These are the newes, and all the newes I haue, God send good newes this yeare, and euermore. Our noble Queene the euerlasting saue, And God increase your Ladiship with store, God blesse my Lady Countesse, and her birth, Her honor, and your worship long life with ioy &amp; mirth. FINIS. Verses penned vpon the Etimologie of the name of the right Woshipfull, Sir Edmond Traffard, of Traffard, in the County of Lancaster, Knight. Such was my hap of late to walk, the lofty hils to view, For to reuiue my weary wits, which studie ouerthrew: And forth I past from high to higher, and so to th'height of all, Where viewing of the countrey round, at length to mind did call The wonders great, and workes of God: when all a Caos was, And lapped vp vpon a lumpe, as hard as beaten brasse, In musing at those daies and these, my flesh began to quake, To call to minde the wretched waies, that worldly men do take: And as I drowned was in dumps, came Morpheus with his mace, So that my sences did obey, and yeelded to his grace. No sooner thus asleep, but straight in drowsie dreame I see A Lady swifter then the wind, call'd Time approching nie. Rise and awake (quoth she) to me, why sleep'st thou on this hill? The wordes I speake I charge thee straight, record with painfull quill. Then did she shake a razor sharpe, and with a frowning face, And thretning speach, she said the world shold suddainly giue place For I am Time which executes the secrete will of God, In euery age of wickednesse, by Time they feele the rod. Els had not flouds ore'flowed the world, for vgly sinfull vice, If Time had not bin present ther, which caus'd th? play their prize I Time shipt Noah into the Arke, and all the charge he had, And I was she first fo?d him land by doues, which made him glad Lo thus at first and euer since vnto this present houre, By Time were builded Cities great with many a loftie tower. Down haue I cast th? all againe, olde walles doe mencion make, And Cities now, &amp; buildings braue, I (Time) shal cause to quake. Although the bragging Worldling raise his house into the aire. I Time will vanish al away, as no such thing were there, My blade is whet, I wait but when to vse the mortall edge: On whom I light, my order is to haue the life in pledge: My sister Atrapos, the Poets do faine the fatall Dame, Who can doe nothing wanting Time, shee doth vsurpe my name: Ne Lachices, nor Clotho can the distaffe dresse at all, But when that I doe point the Time, they come when I doe cal: So that I Time doe beare record from first vnto the last, Of present daies, of daies to come, and daies that now are past: Of yong and olde, of rich and poore, the vertue Time doth prooue, On whom to waite, both king and Prince, and all estates behooue: No state can start by night or day, that Time can not espie, Nor secret shift so closely lapt, but Time the trueth shall trie: I Time therefore am come to thee, of wonders great to tell, Therefore it stands thee much vpon, to vse thy pen as well. Doubt not to write, what I declare, nor feare not who shall see What drops fall from thy painfull pen, but beare thy selfe by me: For lo (said Time) the fire burnes that Mars hath set on fire, See now his cruell mortall blade, that blood doth still desire: The fearfull skrikes of innocents, from far doest thou not heare? Remedilesse (alas) they crie, and die in deepe dispaire. And now behold how h?ger haunts with cheeks both pale &amp; leane, This bloudy butcher, furious Mars, and all his wicked traine: And greedy spoile, spares not to spill, to pray on others good, Rauening Rape with maid and wife runs headlong to the wood. For Fauor flies, and force takes place, and vice doth vertue kill, Fained Friendship now layes on lurtch, his faithful friend to spil. And Shift in shackles now inuents to kick against the spur, And yet Dissembling euery day, lies coutching like a cur: Reuenge is feeing of his friends, in hope to haue a day, But see where Iustice is at hand, his guerdon for to pay. Death doth prouide dame Pestilence, to worke the later woe, Likewise destruction, with his frends, doe wish it to be so. Know this (sayd she) moe plagues then these are comming neare at hand, No creature liuing but shall feele, the same on sea and land: In top of all their worldly trust, shall come the wofull newes, Great terror in the hearts of m?, wh? God these whips shall vse: Time shal try all, this is most true: the Scripture saith the same, Therfore I charge thee send abroad, these sayings in my name. Now rise (quoth she) and turne thy face towards the Occean sea, A triple foorded riuer shall, direct thy ready way: Where thou shalt finde Antiquitie, the maker of the place, Whose name hath bene Tyme out of mynde, before the conquest was: Thus sodenly she tooke her flight, and vanished away, And I in trembling feare did wake, not knowing what to say. Sith dreames be vayne, of Poets pennes, and Fables of delite, So doe I pray, that all proue false, that heare I did indite: Beseeching God with Nestors age, your worship may increase, With health, and wealth, and Newe yeares ioy, and so my pen doth sease. FINIS. Verses penned vpon the Etimologie of the name of the right vvorshipfull Maister Peter Leigh, heire apparant to the valiaunt Gentleman, Sir Peter Leigh, of the linne, Knight. Perusing auncient bookes of late, I founde a storie straunge: Which told me that, the earthly state, Should haue a soden chaunge: And all that is, should nothing bee, Whereat I mused maruellouslye. Erste neuer was my barren brayne, So sodenly be rapt: For to perceiue that all was vayne, I thought it great mishap: Sith once I thought the world should last, To heare destruction, made me basht. Thus as I mused at the same, My wearie wittes, with studie toild: By Morpheus, meanes a sleepe did frame, Least Naturs gifts, should haue bene spoild: But as I slept, a dreame full rare, I had, which greeues me to declare. Enuironde round about was I, From loftie skyes, with golden gleymes: Wherein I saw, a Goddes flye: Thrise swifter then Syr Neptuns streames, A razour in her hand she bare: And fiercely did these wordes declare. Remember well (quoth she) to mee, Make ready pen, and inck, to write: The wordes that now I speake to thee, Sith that I know, thou can indite: Tyme is my name, young once I was, Though now, I weare and wast alas. Loe I am she that present was, When Heauen, Earth, and Seas were made: From age, to age, what came to passe, Unto this houre I know the trade: Although that worldlings Tyme forget, Yet to accompts I call their det. Els those that fleete, and flow in wealth, Would quite deuour the poorer sorte: Sith might alwayes forgets himselfe, And makes of wrong a common sport: I Tyme therfore this bloudy knife, Doe beare vnwares, to shut their life. In Tyme that's past, what Cities great, Whose walles, and towers scald the skyes: Were mounted vp, to be the seat, For earthly Gods, this Scripture tryes: Which lyeth now layd loe with soyle, And who but Tyme, that made the spoyle. Great castles to defend the foe, With walles of force, long sith were built: Their towers torne, doth plainly shoe, That Tyme compeld them for to yeld: Whose ruine doth these dayes declare, That Tyme bids euery man prepare. Haue I not bene, the cause (quoth Tyme) That euery man these dayes doth build: Whose pride therein, so farre doth shyne, That all the poore thereby are spild: But as their goodes, is now their God, I Tyme therefore, shall bring a rod. Erste such a whippe as I shall bring, From mightie Ioue, was neuer feel'd: I all their buildings downe will fling, To flee themselues, shalbe compeld: The sword shall vengeance take for sinnes, And those shall lose, these dayes that winnes. So that if Ouid were aliue, The Metaphor would passe his pen: The father, and the sonne, shall striue. And sharpe reuenge consume all men: The Tenaunt shall his Landlord hate, And neighbours be at great debate. So Loue, and Charitie, shall wast, Pride, and Enuie, shall increase: And pure chastitie, displast, But whoredome, he, shall neuer seace: And Usurie, shall fill his baggs, While poore Tromtroth doth walke in raggs. Quit voide of grace (quoth Tyme) I see, The greatest number, at this day: For Symon Magus, subtilly, By cloaked craft, can catch his pray: The world runs headlong after gayne, Whose pleasure Tyme shall turne to payne: Undoubtedly this rasour sharpe, (quoth Tyme) shall presently dispatch: Yet none shall know, when to depart, No where, nor when, I make the match: But sodenly the threed I cut, Thus wordly ioyes, by me are shut. You see (quoth Tyme) the alteration, You see, how lucar leades the way: You see, these dayes, abhomination, By errour, faith you see decay By bribes, true iustice blinded is, By following will, some wade amisse. Edelfla now, deceiueth vs, By outward signes and also shoe, Faire wordes be framed marueilous, To worke the bearers griefe and woe. But now said Time, the day's at hand, All things shall wast on sea and land: Reuenge from skies with fiery flames, Shall now at hand deuour and wast All mortall men vnto their shames, Except where grace and vertue's plast. Those that beleeue, and God doe feare, As Angels then shall straight apeare. And with these wordes she tooke her flight, And bad me boldly write the same: When Time was gone I was afright, For all the world me thought did flame: With Thunder then the earth did quake, Which wofull thing did cause me wake. FINIS. Verses penned vpon the Etimoligie of the name of the right worshipful, M. Thomas Leigh of Adlington, in the Countie of Chester, Esquire: purporting the nature of Time. The thorny thumps that Thought did thacke within my wofull breast Had pincht me so, that Naturue crau'd for help to purchase rest. Of studious works I weary was, into the fieldes I fled: My purpose was by wholsome aire, for to refresh my head. And as I wandred vp and downe, vnder a bush I sate, Some secrete thing me thought that time, came in my painful pate. Lo thus at last with musing much, a sleepe came in my eie, Erst neuer such a dreame I had, nor thing so strange did see I saw a Lady called Time, which flew as swift as winde, Geue eare (quoth she) for presently I will expresse my mind. Haue care vnto my speech (said she) and mark my sayings well: Els out of wisdomes worthy waies I must thy wits expell. See here the wings wherwith I fly, behold the knife I beare. See here the present speed I make: yet Time no man doth feare. Quite void of care I see the world, they mount with Icarus now, Undoubtedly so that they gaine, to get they care not how. Yet I Dame Time will call to count the stoutest of them all, And giue vnto the loftiest mind, a troublesome tombling fall. Remember Time began all thinges, at first when all was made, Time at the last shall cause againe al thinges to wast and fade. Haue I not cast Ierusalem vnto the slymy soyle? Of worldly welth I make but dust, though worldlings daily toile My nature is as I began, so for to make an end, And cause in time both quick and dead both for to bow and bend. Such is my nature, that I must make tryal of all trueth, Looke from the first vnto the last, let ancient bookes be prooffe. Greeted I haue Cities great, so haue I Castles strong, In euery part of all the world, these buildings lie along. Great is my force, let Scripture indge, which saith al things shal wast, How can the greatest kingdome then escape my force at last. Els worldlings wold still brag and bost vpon their good and land. So I dame Time should haue the tant which haue th? in my hand Such buildings now be mounted vp by such as feare no fall, Quite void of care the builders be, to leaue the same at all, Untill I Time with razor sharpe, do cut their vital thred. I see there is not any now, the latter day doth dread. Esteeme they doe their goods and lands, and Time to come forget Rem?bring not that Time at last shall cause them pay their det. Mark but how hours wasteth daies, and daies the weeks deuoure And weekes consume meneths you see by prooued proofs ech houre. And moneths do swallow vp the yeare, &amp; years do consume men. Al this doth chance by me dame Time, yet who knows where or when? And with this speach she sook her flight, and bad me take my penne. For to record the words she spake, and publish to al men: But when I saw that Time was past, alas she greeu'd me sore: That I in Time did not take Time, I dayly weepe therefore. Thus haue you hearde my drowsie dreame, though Time be gone, and fled, And I her sayings still record within my heart and head. FINIS.

Thy mercie Lord, my faith perswades, although my sinnes be red: How I shall be made free to thee: by Christes blood that's shed. Of all my wandring wilfull dayes and rechlesse rudefull toyes: My faithfull hope is for to mount, to thee in lasting ioyes. And as I wickedly did sinne, I faithfully repent: Such is thy mercie that I knowe, my teares shall thee content. Loe heare my teares the witnesse is, my sin doth grieue me sore: Esteeme O Lord my wofull plaintes, I trust t'offend no more. In thee my onely hope remaines, on thee is all my stay: Geue eare vnto my wofull cries, when I shall passe away. Haue minde vpon thy mercy Lord, forget thy wrath and yre, Erect my Spirite into thy blisse, I humbly thee desire. Els all my teares and grieuous plaintes returne without rewarde: So shall I weare, and wast in woe, my cries shall not be heard: Seeme not therefore to turne thy face, accept my wofull suite: Quit me from Sathans nets and snares, his traps good Lord confute. Unto thy Maiesty O Lord, I dedicate my selfe: Yeeld I doe my soule to thee, and leaue the world my wealth. Accept thereof, thou glorious God, thus still on thee I crie: Reuenge not Lord, but mercie haue, and neuer let me die. All glory be vnto thy name: and to thy onely sonne: And to the holy Ghost, with whom to vs thy kingdome come. FINIS. Verses penned vpon the Etimologie of the name of the right worshipfull Lady, the Ladie Marie Edgarton of Ridley, in the Countie of Chester. The toyled minde and weary wit that study doth oppresse, Nature mooueth many waies, the same for to redresse: Which caused me to leaue my booke, my sences to reuiue, And wandring, walked heare and there, the time away to driue. High vp a hill with wearie steps, the haughtie rockes I scal'd, Among the which I heard a voice, that sore my heart appald: Among the shrubs I shrouded was, where in a trance I sate, Or els some drousie dreame it was, that then and there I gate. Erst was I neuer in the like, for there me thought I see, An armed man with bloody blade with speed approched ny: His face as fierce as flames of fire, his hands imbrewd in blood: And like a Lion in his rage, before me stamping stood. Lo here (quoth he) my name is Mars, that am the bloody God, The gleids that glow within my breast, breeds mischeefe al abrode Kings and kingdomes by the ears I dayly vse to set, Murther is the thing I craue, and peace I still forget. And now (said he) pull foorth thy pen, and write my sayings all, For presently a wonder great, appeare before thee shall: Se here (quoth he) Megera comes with crawling snaky haire, Lo in the bosomes of the best, she throwes them here and there. Dost thou not see what wrath she works, that lurketh close in brest And doest not view what kingdomes I to mortall war haue drest The Messenger I am (quoth he) that Iupiter doth send, to execute his wrath on such, that doe his Grace offend. In vttering of these words to me, far of I did beholde, How Spoile was c?ming &amp; his mates with al the speed they could Whereat the skrikes of innocents, with wiues &amp; virgins cries. And grieuous grones of murthered men did pierce the starry skies My flesh did tremble at the sight, to see the Flames of fire, The robbery both of rich and poore, Distruction did desire, And vgly monstrous Rauishment defilde both maid and wife, The worldly Muckscraps for their goods did daily loose their life. And then came desperation post, to put the rest in feare, And grudging Griefe and future foes, caus'd many to dispaire, Yea Hunger haunted armour bright, with cheeks both pale &amp; lean And pierceth through the sturdy steele, and wrought a mortal pain Reuenge as greedy as a gripe, made hauocke where he came, Distruction with his naked blade distroyed many a man: Dearth was lodg'd in euery house, and kept both land and seas, And almost all both olde and young bewaild the wofull daies. In all thys hurlyburly there, Loue shrank his Neighbours all, And charitie was chac'd a way. Pride slipt and had a fall: Myrth in euery nooke did mourne, and pleasure pained sore, Tom Troth was sworne for to depart the place for euermore. Enuiron'd round about was peace with bloody men of war: Of Charity obscured was the blazing lampe and star, And Pestilence as fier red, the stoutest caus'd to stoope, That Lamentation wrang his handes the countrey round about, Death was the last that laid on lurtch, the finall end to make: and for a brag, his bloody dart about his head did shake: (quoth he) behold, these mischieue mates that on S. Mors attend, Gainst whom no creature can preuale, til I dispatch their end. Great were the brags that Mars did make, and fierce his fury was and sware an oth with present speed all this should come to passe: Then did he turne himselfe about, and Albion Isle he thrate, Which was of Mars no sooner said, but forraine foes heard that: Els had I slept a longer sleepe vpon that haughty hill. But that the roring Cannons voice me thought was th?ping stil And noyse of armed men was such, that (alfright) I wakte, Thus rashly rushing vp for feare, from thence my way did take, Refusing neither hedge nor ditch, nor sparing thick nor thyn, No step so foule my speedy feete made spare to step within: Thus runninng rashly in this race, with panting brethles breath, I rested by a pleasant poole, fast by a litle heath. Thus reuoluing with my selfe what were the best to doo, Whether to tell this dreame or no, sith dreames be call'd vntrue: Which maz'd my mind with triple trance what way were best to take, This dream for to reueile, or els to dround in Lethea lake Of th'one and th'other being basht: the likliest way to chuse, At length thought good to pen my dreame, in steed of better newes Beseeching God to blesse this Isle from Mars and all his mates, And graunt vs peace. God saue our Queene and al the noble states No other newes for this new yeare I can your worship tell, But that I trust in spite of Mars that all things shall be well. Beseeching God that sits to iudge, to guyde your dayes in peace, With health, long life, and ioyfull years, and worship to increase. FINIS. Verses penned vpon the Etimologie of the name of the right Worshipful. M. Peter Warberton of Arley, in the Countie of Chester, Esquire. Prepare a place aboue the skies, Where Angels rest in ioy: Out of all mundane thoughts arise, Which workes the soules annoy, Of Time watch well the stealing steps, Take heed of youth that age forgets, All thinges haue time, by power deuine, And Time consumeth all, She hath cut off the mightiest kinges, And so the rest she shall. Emperour, King and Kaisar she Doth mount vpon the stage, And all that shall aduaunced be, Time raiseth in ech age. So Time dismountes them all againe. Some from great ioy, to shame and paine, Thus rich and poore she euermore Cuts off both great and small: The Captaine stout and all his rout Shee spoyles, and euer shall. Therefore watch well, this hastie Dame, That makes thys mortall speede: As all our Parents felt the same, With vs she will proceede: Time flies apace she taries not, She grantes no grace if men forgot, At first she is as sugar sweete, But ends like bitter gall, Let Worldlinges watch that be asleepe, For Time no doubt they shall. Remember Tyme, built Cities great, Which now is wildernes: With many a costly and stately seat, That now consumed is: And Tyme, these dayes builds many hours, Which shall in Tyme, be none of ours: For as the seas, doth ebbe and floe, So Tyme doth with vs all: Now chuse who thinks of Tyme or noe, All thinges consume she shall. Who marketh Tyme, in these our dayes, Her workes be wondrous straunge: For those that erste did beare the keyes, By Tyme doth office chaunge: And from the hall, to kitchin comes, And at the length, bide fortuns domes: As captiue stand, to hold vp hand, To liue or dye at all: Who can preuaile: when Tyme doth deale, Which will consume and shall. And doth not Tyme make infants strong, Of young and tender age: When six and thirtie yeare hath sprong, These lustie blouds on stage: Marke Tyme when all this race is run, Unlooked for croukt age doth come: And by no meanes but onely Tyme, Therfore lets watch her all: Sith downe she casteth, such as clyme, And euermore she shall. Right thus of age, Tyme maketh dust, And so she doth of youth: And Tyme still tryes, all things that's iust, And brings vs all to prooffe: And Tyme shall at the later day, The filthy factes of men bewray: Not sparing one, nor leauing now, But to accompts bring all: And thus hath she perswaded mee, She doth and euer shall. Els could not now, the world be old, Which at the first was young: For Tyme, her selfe now waxeth cold, Her limmes be not so strong: As in her first beginning she, Nor halfe of Nature francke and free: Her loftie lookes, I read in bookes, Beginneth for to fall: Her galland cheare, begins to weare, Yet she shall end vs all. Remember then all thinges begun, Must haue an end at last: For when the vitall, threed is spun, The mortall knife makes hast: For Attropos doth tend on Tyme, As wayting mayde by power diuine: Unlooked for, or men be ware, She breakes both heart and gall: And when she smiles she worketh wiles. For to consume vs all, Thus trudgeth Tyme and tarrieth not, To tend vpon her pray: And layes her snares, in the euery plot, To twitch all states away: Therefore iudge if the world be vayne, That greedy gapeth, still for gayne. One brother selleth now an other, And worldly wealth rules all: But Tyme doth watch, for to dispatch, For so at length she shall. Of this beware, and marke it well, For Tyme, is now at hand: That Tyme all pleasures shall expell, Aswell by sea as land: Not one but all, shall tast of woe, Of very force, it must be soe: Els sinne, would sincke, and vice would drinke, The workes of vertue all: So Tyme consumes, those that presumes, Loe thus she doth and shall. Such is the force of Tyme ye see, Such is the ende of all: Here may we see that vanitie, Doth worke our mortall thrall: Quite now your selues, from worldly mucke, Least Tyme vnlookt your liues to plucke: Undoubtedly in Tyme foresee, To win the way to rest: And helpe the poore, which is the store, For which God thinkes you blest. If Tyme cut of, all liuing thinges, And still bringes all to nought: And shall to iudgement bring the kinges, Aswell for deede, as thought: Then let the meaner stats take heed, To watch and pray with present speed: Els in the snares, of Tyme vnwares, We must to iudgement all: Remember this, great neede it is, For Tyme consume vs shall. FINIS. Verses penned vpon the Etimologie of the name of the right vvorshipfull George Brereton of Ashly in the Countie of Chester Esquyre. Grace growes and springs, where vertue vaunts her selfe, Els wicked men, would swallow all by wealth: On euery man, God doth his gifts bestow, Regarding most where vertue seemes to grow: Great is his mercy to vs euery hower, Els how could Dauid, conquere Saules great power. Beware therefore, of Mydas wicked mynde, Refuse the world, whose pleasures men doth blind: Erect thy steps, in grace and vertues pathe, Remember that in wisedomes well thou bath: Esteeme no wretch, whose tongue shal paint or gloze, There pick-thanke pranks, shall but thy worship lose: Of friendes to come, it's vaine to hope soo much, Nor present friendes, their frendship greatly tutch. Enter not where doubtes are of returne, So needes not care, though after claps doe spurne: Such wisedome warely, shall prouide thy way, Quite from the spares, that should thy state decay: Unto the poore stretch out thy stretched hand, In Princes cause, looke faithfully thou stand: And pitie still where power hath opprest, Remember this, and men shall thinke thee blest. FINIS. Verses vpon Ieffrey Shackarley of Holme and Shackarley, Esquyer. In present blisse, watch warely future harmes, Els Sirces shall bewitch thee, with her charmes: Flye from the steps, of such as feare not God, For els offenders iustly feel his rod: Regard that man, that plainly telleth truth, And banish those, that fabling flatterie sooth, Yeld curtesie to them that gentle are. So Truth thy worship, shall abroad declare, Haue no regard to lend thy eares to such: As shall with lyes true faithfull meaning touch, Condemne no man, till thou his aunswere heare: Know this by Scripture, iustice hath no peare, Consider patience proueth, vertues mynde: And worship worketh euer after kinde, Remember them, that craue for Christes sake: Least God his gifts, away from thee shall take, Endure firme in fayth, obseruing law, Yeld to thy Prince, a iust obedient awe. Doe thus and so, the golden trumpe of Fame, By true report, shall iustly say the same. FINIS. Verses vpon Maister Hugh Sharkerly, the sonne and heire of the sayd Ieffray, Esquyer. Haue patience present, when wrath would wreke his will, Els wisedome wants, that guideth men from ill: When youthfull toyes, would rashly rule the rayne, Geue eare to age, who tels that all is vayne: Haue care to watch the world and feare no foe. So wisedome shall, thy witte declare and show: Haunt not the steps, where Cupid leads the way, And let no toung, thy counsell once bewray: Conceile nothyng, that duetie bids reueile, Know subiects must, nothing from Prince conceale: Constraine no man, not more then power is, And heare no picke-thanks, telling that and this: Reach to the poore, that craue for Christes sake, Let reason rule, when will would hauocke make: Endure sure as all thy stocke hath done, In doing so thou shinest like the sunne. FINIS. Vpon Maister Ieffray Shackcarley Esquyre. In Fortunes frendship watch her chaunging face, Els sodenly, she may dismount the best: For those that most, doe stand within her grace, From age to age, haue cause to trust her least: A prooffe too playne, looke whom she luls in lap, You see at length, she spoyles with some mishap. She setteth some, on throne of stately seat, Higher then the rest, on golden mounts to vaunt: And yet at last, proues but a poysoned bayt, Compounde with guile, the worldlings to inchaunt: Know this of Fortune, where she seemes to smile, Custome there doth teach her worke a wyle: And those that in her flouds, hoyse sayles the herte, Reuenging still themselues vpon their foes: Loe sodenly there unbelieves fall is next, Entrapt with snares, that workes most wofull woes, You see that Fortune, faileth none but such. As in these dayes, doe trust her ouer much. FINIS. Lenuoy. When raging flouds, of surging seas be hext, And Boreas blastes, against the rocks doth rush: The present fall, by Nature is the next, And quiet calmes remaines in euery bush, So likewise such, as Fortune fauoreth most: By her displeasure, sodenly is lost. FINIS. Verses penned vpon the Ethimologie of the name of the right vvorshipful Lady: The Lady Iulian Holcraft, of the Vale Royall. The golden trump, that Fame doth sound, Proclaimes to euery eare: Where vertue is, for to be found, By workes it doth appeare: As gold commends, the precious stone, So worship showes, her selfe alone: As Phœbus doth exceede a starre, So gentlenes doth show: How can Dame Fortune mount more harre, Then place her darlings so. Enuie nor spite can not preuayle, Where vertue vaunts with grace: Old auncient wrath of force shall faile, And vices shall geue place: Where worship worthily shall show, There iust report, the Fame shall blow: And euery eare, such newes shall heare, As due desert doth craue: Loe Ladyes all, behold you shall, Who ought most honor haue. A Dame well deckt with modestie, As worship doth behoue: And garmentes lynde with lenitie, When patience list to proue: With stomachers, of pure pitie, And head geare, that is wise and wittie: And liberall myndes, all people binds, To honor such in hart: Doe thus and then, the harts of men, You win in euery part. In stormes, when wisedome is the cloake, No blast can blemish such: This is the way for to prouoke, Your Fame the skyes to touch: Unto the poore, stretch out your hands, God shall your store, increase, and lands: Loue them that plainly tels you true, And banish golden speach: Pick thankes mischief dayly brew, And all mens harts they sigh. Yeld not, vnto a cruell foe, Where truth is on your side: And warely watch a friend to know, That stedfastly will byde: And where you may reuenge in deede, Let mercy presently proceede: Nothing doth please, the Lord alwayes, So much as mercy still: For mercy binds, all noble myndes, To saue and not to spil. Haue mynde that all that is begun, Must haue an ende at last: The end, no King, nor Prince, can shunne, Sith Time all thinges will wast, Of Time her trade you see it still, Time buildeth all, and giues the fall, To all things quicke and dead: The lucky life is to be wisht, The end is to be dread. Lo here the fruits of vertues rare, That in one lady is: Conceiue the same, and straight prepare, For worship teacheth this, Remember where is courtesie, That riseth of gentilitie: Of mercie, grace and charitie, Comes blessings of the Lord. For if these want assuredly, They still remaine abhorr'd. Beholde how vertue beares the keyes, That vnto blisse doth lead, A Lady liuing at these daies, Whose worship Fame doth spread, Her name I will not now expresse, Sith iust report doth all confesse. But as I prooued, so I praise, And will doe till I die, Her liberall hand her heart bewraies, Aboue the starrie skie. God blesse her still from time to time, From dangers, woe, and paine, That she in worship still may shine, And long in health remaine: And God protect her noble birth Long for to liue in ioy and mirth. And that their honors may increase, As sand vpon the Sea, And this to pray I will not cease. But call on God God alwaies. FINIS. The last Dreame that Morpheus did showe vnto the Author, vvas of a Lambe, that appeared vnto him, and seemed as though he spake for the Time, by the prouidence of the Gods: as follovveth. Last at my booke in studie where I sate, My wits worne weak, my sence was grose and lame, A drosie dump began to pierce my pate, That in mine eie, a sleepe began to frame: Which when I spied, yet reason bad me rise, And sluggish sleepe alwaies for to dispise. To shun that sloothfull vice my hauke I tooke, I calde my Spannels, and to the field I went: A flight to finde, both brake and bush I shooke, till too and fro, three howers full were spent: Thus wandring long, my Spannels found of game, And I made hast with speede to flie the same. The Partridge sprang, my hauke fled from my fist. With open Iawes my Spanniels cried the game, With speedy foote, no hedge nor ditch I mist, Through thicke and thin I ran, to see the same. But out of sight both hauke and Partridge flew, Till I by following, into a Desert drew. And being thus in vncouth place not knowen, Both Hawke and Spanneils lost and from me fled: And I with toylling trauell ouerthrowen, Dame Nature came, and thus vnto me sayd: Preserue thy selfe (quoth she) thy hawke is gone, And take some rest, for other helpe is none. To whom I did obey and downe I sat, Upon a bancke and leaned to a thorne: And rested there till Morpheus hit my pat, With his drowsie mace, &amp; said to me in scorne: Well met Faukoner, what haue you kild to day, Cho ho hath croken bill, her maister left astray? Let Hawkes and Spanels packe and follow me, (Quoth he) for now thou shalt in deede attend: Although thou meant, gainst duetie from me flee, I pardon thee, although thou did offend: So many times though I haue troubled thee, This is the last, I promise faithfully. Thus like a lump or clod of clay I was, For why? my vitall sprite with Morpheus went, For to behold what he would bring to passe, With weary straps to wait I was content, Til at the last a Lambe did vs approche, Who did thys sentence brauely to vs broch. Que brantare la fe, es causa muy fea. Which wordes made me no little for to muse, To heare a Lambe in language strange to say, Those that breake faith, do all the Gods abuse, And are detected at the latter day. Then sayd this Lambe, sith Robinson is here, Before he passe some wisdome shall he leare, Wel said my Lambe (quoth Morpheus) let vs heare, Some sayings graue out off Experience schoole: Sith thou his Scholler, learned many a yeare, And hath bene Usher for to see good rule, I pray thee now vnto my Clearke declare, The flatterers feats, and see that none thou spare. And with these wordes he mounted ore a hill, And Lambe and me left by a riuer side, Stay, stay (quoth Lambe) rest here and if thou wil, Til of my speach thou haue experience tride, And saying thus, he stept into his caue, And brought a glasse of Skill exeeeding braue. Lo here (quoth Lambe) and then began to blett, And made me signes to looke within the glasse: Here maist thou see (said he) of deepe deceit, The total sum, I meane of more and lesse. And by the same before thou passe shalt prooue, Who is thy friend, and who dissembleth loue. I greedily the glasse began to graspe, Wherein I saw a number that I knew. With honnied mouths, yet natur'd like the waspe. That at the length their stings against me threw But yet I did dissemble all the while, Because I would perceiue their fraude and guile. Then looking stil within thys glasse I see The loftie lookes of some that spake me faire, And in their friendship so imbraced me, That outwardly true meaning did appeare, When Morpheus Lambe perceiu'd I did th? trust Take heed betime (quoth he) they are vniust. These are Camallians that change to euery color They showe like gold, but inward worse than brasse, Looke what they promise makes no purse the fuller, As by experience proofe declares no lesse. Of forrein frayes they tell a bloudy tale, But commonly they quarrell with good ale, Therefore (sayd he) trust not an alehouse frend, Beleeue them not that are accustomed to lye: A boasting souldiours tale, hath neuer end, And flattering wordes, be false so shalt thou try: Rough trees, rough fruit, rough tast doe beare, See vice and vertue showes, in whom they doe appeare. And therefore trust not the vntrustie man, To doe and say, doth differ much ye know: Great difference is, twixt Orpheus skill and Pan, You know the sense, what neede I more to show: And therefore he, that violateth fayth, Is worthy as I sayd to suffer death. Stay yet sayd Lambe, behold more of this glasse, See where one bounseth in a players gowne: Furde like a foole, as nice as ere she was, The brauest tipling tib, that is within the towne: While she at tick tacke, tryes to proue her chaunce, Her husband is content, a hornpipe for to daunce. She is well custom'd, both with rich, and poore, Fye of Gentillitie, for she can speake no French: Which blemisheth, her banner, and craks her credit sore, And yet notwithstanding, she is a bounsing wench, She dayly doth vsurpe, a Gentlewomans name: I list to speake no more of her, for bearing blame. And with these wordes this Lambe agayne did bleyte, And as it seem'd by countenaunce morned much: And sayd oh foolish Poliphils drowned in conceite, Why thinke you of your selues, as though there were none such: You play Sabinas part, that proud lasciuious Dame, Whose vgly life the Poets, haue penned to her shame. Fiue hundreth Asses milke, she dayly had the bathe, For to increase her vice, and bewtie to preserue: As at these dayes, our countrey women craue, Out of a little hyde, a thong to large they craue: For euery poore mans daughter, now is prankt in silke, Which doth Sabinas hath, incounter made of milke. These base-borne birth Galeriæs heart exceeds, That Neros golden pallaces did disdayne: They thinke them flowers, which are in deede but weeds, For truth, doth try them, counterfetted playne: As some men haue, of veluet scabarts made, That dayly couers, a rustie canckered blade. Of poyson Poets write, that Cleopatra dyed, No, no, (quoth Lambe) it is a lye indeed: Her death came thus, in stories as I read, By a bodkin that she bought, her heart did bleyd: With which she vs'd, to curle her golden haire, Wherewith she kild her selfe, it doth appeare. Loe heare you lewde lasciuious wanton sort, That doe delite, to paint your selues in pride: No doubt but you, shall smart for youthfull sport, When mettel shalbe, by the fire tryde: When flaming fire (I say) the gold shall try, In Plutos pit, you shall for euer cry. Thus prating promisers, hold still your fruitles brags, Among your potts, your promises performe: Els will the wise, perceiue your wardrop rags, And to your shame, will laugh you all to scorne: You mistres tipler, that would so gentle bee, For all your furs, your tricks the world doth see. Learne to speake French, and if you wilbe gentle, For French must make you mistres, that's most sure: Because your birth is, very base and simple, And you a tipler, whose life is nothing pure: Learne to know thy selfe, thy neighbours know thee well, Per foy merritriciam, els will I ring thy bell. And then aloude this Lambe to laugh began, To Limbo lake (quoth he) la iambe les piedz packe: Les leures of such, inticeth many a man, To vtter confusion, and euerlasting lacke: Loe mistres tipler, if you will gentle be, It's more then tyme you come, to learne this French of me, And at these wordes, a while this Lambe did pause, And spying me, a weary of the Tyme: Upon the earth, began to scrape his clawes, Friend Robinson (quoth he) thy listning eares incline: For now women, that good and vertuous were, I purpose by my speach, thou presently shalt heare. Posthumia was of euill sore accused, For merry countenaunce, of ill she was condemn'd: Minutius, her husband, her company refused, And home agayne his wife, did to her parents send: If countenaunce then, so great a vice was thought, What say you by the act, this day that's dayly wrought. In Calcedon, both mayds, and matrons vs'd, Unto a straunger, but one cheeke to show: Hierous wife, all peoples breth refus'd, Except her husbands, no mans els did know: No showes in Egypt, neuer women had, The cause was this, they hated for to gad. When in Boetia, the Damsels, married were, A noble custome worthie note they had: A vertue rare, no doubt it did appeare. In those I say, that loued not to gad: Her coyche was burn'd, that day she married was, Which signifi'd, from home she would not passe. The daughters of Lisander, refus'd the rich attire, That from Sicilie, was as tokens sent: Least that the pride thereof, their hearts should fire, The glittering show, they did no deale commend: For vertue was, the iewell that they sought, All stately dealings, banisht from their thought. Loe heare sayd Lambe, the life that Ladies liu'd, The simpler sort, according calling went: One at an others state enuied not, nor greeu'd, Ne yet the Tyme in lewdnes neuer spent: No wandring vnto waks, those dayes did women vse, Nor gadding vnto greens, their life for to abuse. Then was the husbandman, and all his children knowne, By such attire, as them became to weare: Th'artificer, by pride was not orethrowne, Then malice in mens mynds, did not appeare: Nor no man would, breake promise at that Tyme, Faith, loue, and charitie, in hearts of men did shine. Now poore mens pride, hath brought the world to nought, Their children as I sayd, so pranck in pride: Incountring Gentlemen, as neare as may be thought, The common wealth, in England hath distroyde: And filthy flatterie, these dayes is so imbraced, The cogging crew away true meanyng chased. And with these wordes, this Lambe, lookt on me fast, Marke well my speach (quoth he) an other tyme: For now thou seest that Phœbus maketh hast, Into the Occidentall flouds for to decline: In tyme to come trust thou no flattering friend, Nor tipling tib, except, to much thou spend. The Meritrix, the furred foole doth vse, Spy thou and at her mates a litle while: For she, and they, shall reape, they may not chuse, The fruits they graft, vpon their sinfull soyle: As euery wight, doth know their vice vntold, Shall ere they dye, their woful end behold. Thus presently came Morpheus backe agayne, How now my lambe (quoth he) hast done my will: Hast told my Clarke, thy mynde &amp; meaning plaine, That of the world, he may haue better skill: I haue my Lord (quoth Lambe) done what I may, Plainly vnto Dunstable, to direct the way. I thanke thee sayd Sir Morpheus for the same, I will that he, and thou, this present tyme depart: For that he beares abroad, a writers name, I will not stay him longer from his act: Thus sodenly I wakened out of sleepe, In Dreaming long, this lambe became a sheepe. Thus blushing brood, awaken I from sleepe, And on the soden, dasht in drowsie dumps: Began with speed, for to plucke vp my feete, Because the place, did put me to my iumps: This desert was, alas vnknowen to mee, My Hawke, nor Spannels could I neuer see. But what this lambe by Morpheus meanes did say, With diligence, I pen'd that other day. FINIS. The Authours name in Verdict. Remember Lord for Christes sake, by mercy to forgeue, In iudgement on those people now, that sinnefully doe liue. Condemne them not that retchles are, and doe thy lawes forget, Haue mercy on all them, that trust, Christes bloud shall pay theyr det, Against my wofull cries oh Lord, shut not thy mercy gate, Receiue my sinfull soule of God, to enter in thereat. Doe not condemne me for my guilt, let mercy thee perswade. Reuenge not Lord, my wofull workes, when I in sinne did wade, Oh God most high and mighty Lord, in whom is all my trust. Be mercyfull to those which are, before thy eyes vniust, In time of trouble still I cald, vpon thy holy name: Now doe I cry to heale my soule, and trust thou hearst the same. Such is thy mercy promised, to them that doe relent: O, Lord that thou forgeuest such, that faythfully repent: Nothing oh God, doth greeue me more, then doth my carelesse race. Of wicked wilfull wretched workes, I call to thee for grace: For why my sinnes craue punishment, and are as scarllet red. And yet I trust for to be sau'd, by Christes bloud that shed: Looke downe with louing eyes oh Lord, and heare my wofull cry: Thy grace extend to guide my feete, least I should wade awry: O Lord my rude and carelesse life, with wild and wilfull blade: Now greeueth me for conscience doth, my soule in thee perswade. FINIS. [My dayes I see, are vayne on earth, my time doth steale away] My dayes I see, are vayne on earth, my time doth steale away: My youth is past, and age drawes neare, my health doth still decay. My lennow limmes grow dry &amp; stiffe, my bones be full of payne: My former pleasures workes me woe, I chaunge to dust againe. I not delite in mondane mucke, nor in these pleasures vayne: But in thy kingdome is my ioy, where thou doest aye remaine: Take heare my faithfull sacrifices of iust repenting heart. In tyme of death deliuer Lord my soule from Sathans darte: All honor glory be to thee, and to thy onely sonne: Who with the holy ghost be prayse, thy will on earth be done. FINIS.</field>
