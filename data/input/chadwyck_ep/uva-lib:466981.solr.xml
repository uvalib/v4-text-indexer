      <field name="fulltext">Sonnets. I.—THE NIGHTINGALE. Not farther than a fledgling's weak first flight, In a low dell, standeth an antique grove; Dusky it is by day, but when 'tis night, None may tread safely there, unlit by Love. In lonelier days, it was my mood to rove At all hours there—to hear what mirth I might Of the passionate Lark, the brooding Dove, And the strong Thrush—all breathers of delight. When Night's drawn curtains darkened the deep vale, And the rich music of the day was ended, Out gushed a sudden song of saddest wail, Breaking the silence it with sweetness mended:— It was the voice of the waked Nightingale— Come, love, and hear her melancholy tale. III.—TO THE NIGHTINGALE. Oh Nightingale, that poet sure was sad Who called thee Sorrow's bird! Unto my ear, (Familiar to her mournful voice, as 'twere A fretful sister's,) thy saddest song seems glad As the Lark's matin when the trees are clad— As the blythe Cuckoo when white May is near— Or any sound that maketh Delight mad, And drains a passionate heart of its fond tear. Let the dull-eared deem thee a melancholy Bird and sorrowful, and misconceive thy song, Heard in Night's silence the calm woods among: Heed thine own song, and never note their folly; But sing to lovers in thy dark delight, And make them sigh with a mirth too exquisite! V.—THE BOWER. Hard by, there is a secret greenwood nook— Haply by fairies formed, for the repose And pleasure of their queen:—a silvery brook, Reflecting all that overhangs it, flows Musically by, with noise of many springs; The young birds tenant it, and woo and pair, And silent sit to hear the Thrush, who sings His frequent song of summer-blytheness there. 'Twill soon be reach'd, if we use willing speed; Then let us hence—making so little stir, Our light steps shall not rouse the grasshopper. I have a song to breathe—a book to read; And we will pass the hours in such employ As shall to our twin hearts give certain joy. VI.—THE THUNDER-SHOWER. Behold, the triumphing Sun looks forth again! The angry clouds which murmured at his will, O'ercome by his kind smile, have wept a rain Of penitent tears, and the storm's gust is still. We may now leave our leafy-dark retreat, And shape our course as was our first intent;— The grass is fresh and lusty, and our feet Skim o'er't like fairies', leaving it unbent. The wanton, busy-handed Zephyrs raise The heavy-swaying branches from our heads; And now we pass beneath them, and the breeze As gently falls them down again, and sheds Its gems on thee, uplooking like a flower— Or Danaë sprinkled by a silvery shower. VII.—THE JOURNEY. That Love when journeying to Delight should tire! That Beauty, too, (both of celestial birth,) Should faint and pine for wants that are of earth, And which the body only doth require! That souls which soar to heaven, and would wing higher, Should be thus imped, in their divinest mirth, By things to minds immortal nothing-worth, And which clean spirits loathe as an alloying mire!— These muttered thoughts, that baffled Bliss did frame, My bosomed love half heard—and took for chiding That which frail Nature, and not her, did blame; And now as light she sped as a sylph riding The many-winded air, until we came To that green nook, the bower of our abiding! VIII.—THE ARBOUR. Here, in this bower, greenest of summer nooks, The wild Bee's mew, the Violet's hiding-place, Listening the bickerings of two brawling brooks, We sat, and watched them wrangle and embrace; Till tired of this, one of her choicest books I drew from forth its hold, which she 'gan trace, But I could nothing read, save her fair face— Its eyes, its smiles, and fond tale-telling looks— Oh comment sweet, the poet's text excelling! I heard her voice, but naught of what she said; And all she spake in love, and all she read, Wrapt in the music of her lips, came swelling Faintly but full, and sounded to my ears Like an angel's voice singing above the spheres. IX.—THE SAME. I thought of Laura in that green recess Where Petrarch took her beauty to his heart; And though Love never maimed me, his smart I felt as mine, nor did I wish it less. I looked on my fond Fair in vacantness— And nothing noted those blue veins which part (Like branches of a stream in some fair chart) Oh her white, waxen brow, by a loose tress And her supporting hand snowily hid; Nor her small lips, which now breathed rosy sighs, Now honeyed lines; nor her calm, clear blue eyes, Shut in like jewels by her golden lid:— My thoughts were wandering like a winding stream, Yet she was still the theme and passion of my dream. X.—THE GRASSHOPPER. Thou freaksome, light-limbed elf, whom none may follow With eye or ear, so changeful is thy bent, Sing now thy catchy song, so innocent And young in melody, that nice Apollo Hath hearkened it well-pleased. Again from out Thy hiding-place, in the thick-spireing grass, Its short, sweet shrillness send. This bower about Let it still restless run, and whirling pass, Eachwhere in shortest space of one fleet minute, Swifter than sudden Thought can think of thee. They're here who love thy voice, and deem there's in it A natural delight, which pure Simplicity May listen to unblushingly, with her meek Turned head, and wonder-smiling cheek. XI.—THE WILD-FLOWERS. Nay, never cull these dainty flowerets, love, Sleeping like infants on their mother's breast! To-morrow, all being fair as now, we'll rove This way—when thou shalt see them lovelier drest, And looking thankfully, with tears in eye, As orphans do when they with kind ones meet;— Lo, now they lie in reverence at thy feet, And worship as thou wert their deity!— There's many an eye less bright and free than thine, Of lone, lorn wretches, mewed in cell and mine, Would sparkle out for very joy to see These cheerful Wild-flowers, humble as they are! For me, when pensive, I have wished I were Companioned with no better, blyther company. XII.—THE VIOLET. This is the Violet, love—a flower I prize, For its pure life is thine. Its pleasure is To live secluded in calm nook like this, Beneath a leafy shelter, and the sky's Blue, summer look of clearness; drinking in The breath and dews of freshness, night and morn; Hearkening the Lark's high hymn; and the confusing din Which the Bee makes with his small-compassed horn, Himself most pleased by its dull, drowsy hum: Yet the meek Violet not despiseth it, Well-knowing he doth serenading come For what of sweets as alms she may think fit To part withal—a minstrel beggar he, Who, when his wants are fed, wends homeward merrily. XIII.—THE BEE. Marked you a Bee who circled round our ears, And stunned them with his noisy trumpeting, Now faintly heard? Again these flowers he nears, But drops among them with more cautious wing. With his monotonous voice he first to sleep Hath lulled these maiden flowers, and now doth steal, Just as Dishonesty will watch and creep, To rob them whilst they nothing fear or feel. When he is sated, with a louder blow Of his deep horn he'll hence—but not by stealth; Glad and rejoicing you shall hear him go, Leaving them robbed of beauty's virgin wealth:— How like to a seducer vile is he, Winning by craft what others want through honesty! XIV.—SUNSET. All eyes that see are poring on the West, Where the rich-tressed traveller of the day (Though faded are the splendours which he drest At morning in, when fresh he took the way That wearied him, in the bright affluence Of orient pomp) still showeth glorious As a proud prince returned from fields victorious, But silent in his pride—'tis so intense!— Now he is gone, lone Silence thinks his praise; Pale, pensive Evening weepeth his decease; And there's an awful stillness—as of death, And the last breathing of a good man's breath, Who ends in serious hope life's term of days:— Ah, love, may our lives' close be all as full of peace! XX. Had I that Raphael's wings, to whom the space Round earth and sky was but a moment's flight; And eyes of heaven's recorder, whose keen sight Looks through the gloom that muffles earth's dark face; And Milton's voice sublime, which deftly sang To angels' harps, harmonious ringing round Th' eternal throne—till with its full, rich sound The chrysolite halls and echoing heavens rang,— There is a beautiful Being I would find— A Rose, the fairest in sweet Paphos' bower; There is an ear which I would wind and wind Giddily round, like Bee about a flower; But Love, who took my heart, hath ta'en voice, eyes, And wings—and wanting these, I lose Hope's promised prize. XXII.—LOVE OF THE FIELDS. I leave the marts where gold, where silver's won, For places where their hues alone are seen, In yellow flowers, that burnish in the sun— And white, that silver-tip the May-banks green. And on his scrambled heaps the miser's eyne, Amorous of his bane, did never gloat With half of my delight when as I note The moonlight silvering the waters sheen. And herein am I richer far and wiser Than him who barters life for Commerce' wealth, And as he groweth rich turns poor and miser, Losing the life of life—delight and health— And innocent nights—and charitable days, Not spent to his sole ends, but the good Giver's praise. XXIII.—MOODINESS. When I am fretted to that wayward mood Which urgeth me to shun the haunts of man For serious silence and strict solitude,— That passion spent, such solace as I can (For instant loss of friends—from whom my rude, Strange melancholy parts me) I take; and scan— Half glad, half sad—wise Nature in her plan And nice completions; and long time brood Deeply and awfully, till some small theme Or vast—the Robin's trill; the murmuring Of mingling springs; the rushing of a stream, Rapid and rough—or winds on their strong wing, Wins me from myself, to love society, Which I had loathed and left only from love's satiety. XXIV.—LOVE OF NATURE. I sigh not for rich Peru's buried ore, Nor any part she has abundantly Disgorged; nor power, nor state, nor pageantry; Nor prize the wealth that heaps up Commerce' shore, Nor that which rides her waves; nor the large store Which Neptune has obtained too frequently From the sunk travellers of the perilous sea; Nor aught of that which makes rich misers poor. Give all these life-bought nothings unto them Of whom they are ador'd; let them have gold And silver in huge masses, and the gem That would out-price the richest diadem— So I but hear sweet Nature's voice, behold Her face, and touch her humblest green robe's hem. XXV.—TO ITALY. ON MR. C?S L?H'S VISIT TO ROME, IN 1819. Mother of Dante and Raffaelle—Italy, Poets will ever love thy skies of calm, And voice of music, and warm breath of balm, And glorious forms of grace and majesty!— Old Chaucer loved thee for Boccaccio's stories— Spenser for Tasso's; and Milton trod Thy viny fields—Milton, minstrel of God,— And loved idolatrously thy olden glories. As poets have loved thee, do thou love them— And chiefly one who wanders now thy land; Be as the fondest lover unto him; And shield him from the savage bandit's hand, As mother would her son; and play the part That's Roman to a Roman—soul and heart. XXVII.—TO WINTER, FOR HIS CHARITY. I love thee, Winter, son of the stern North; And much delight to bask by thy heaped fire, And hear thy out-door minstrels hoarsely choir Songs for thy Christmas mirth; and much am loth To leave thy chimney-nook, when winds rush forth, Sudden as clamorous brawlers, and long time tire The peace-fond Night with noise. Thou dost inspire Thoughts warmer than Summer's; and feelings worth Vast tomes of summer-verse—promptings of love, That teach the humane wealthy the disparity 'Tween poor and rich, and weal and want, and move Their hearts to ruth—their hands to charity..... For this, may Spring, th' usurper, give no pain; But render thee due praise, though he dispute thy reign. XXVIII.—THE HAUNTS OF YOUTH. Scenes which were wayward boyhood's serious joy, I look on ye with Memory's lidless eyes; And not a thing they see but doth employ Thoughts that will live till he who weeps them dies! Time spareth ye: but me—mind, form, and face, All that to manhood's youth belonged—his will (Which none may thwart) hath changed; and left, in place, Thoughts deeply sad—a body bending still Beneath a sickness 'tis too weak to bear— Cold features, channelled by chill tears of grief— A heart that seeks but finds no fixed relief, And hath no better tenant than Despair— A spirit ceaseless in its murmuring, That life's long winter hath no second spring. XXIX.—SICKNESS. When Sickness shews us life's dim-waning lamp, And bids us turn our darkening eyes above; When friends hang o'er our beds, and wipe the damp Cold dews of death with the soft hand of love,— 'Tis good to have and feel that mental power Which doth surpass the strong man's puny might— (Prepared thus, in life's most fateful hour We unappalled stand, and brave its spite); But better still, and cause for praise, to have Fair Conscience sitting smilingly and calm— Fresh-living hopes that look beyond the grave, And are to wounded hearts a present balm— And cheerful, hopeful thoughts, that smile and bloom Above the body's wreck, like flowerets o'er a tomb. XXX.—DERMODY'S GRAVE. Tread with the soft, slow step of reverence Above these still apartments of the dead; Not that the echo of our heaviest tread Would break Death's slumber. Here Intemperance Lies dumbly, soberly; th' unreined madness He revelled and delighted in is spent And fallen into this melancholy sadness; The glibsome tongue, whose speech was merriment, And wit, and poetry, and knowledge, moulders In the dark hollow of the fleshless jaws; The ear that drank the poison of Applause Is deaf, though Fame's voice speaks to it—Beholders Of this young grave, it doth become ye sigh For one who lived so madly—died so miserably! XXXI. How I have fallen from youth's sublime intent— How far I am from where my hopes did tend; Living a life so useless, indolent— The Sloth stirs more than I, and to more end!— My soul, which stretched out like a giant sea, Goes forth from its cold, cheerless tenement As from an ark that is its prison—sent, Like Noah's dove, abroad upon discovery; And it returns as that lone bird returned, Bringing no tidings such as Hope should bring— But lost in regions where it once sojourned, It wingeth back, with fearful fluttering, To that loathed home from whence it hopeful started, Hopeless and helpless—wing-broke—and broken-hearted. THE DYING MINSTREL. Sister, only one befriending, Save with lying words of breath— Sister, only one attending Sorrow's couch and Sickness' death— Lo, a day is newly breaking Whose decline I may not see; And thy lover's lute is waking Thee, who slightest sleep for me. Lift the lattice, and assure him With a smile that thou art his; And if absence woundeth, cure him With a look that hopes of bliss. Happier lover he than ever Love would let thy brother be; What he loves is his, and never May he be unblest as me! Had I been like him caressed With the love of such a heart, Not for heaven and the blessed Would I willingly depart. Droop not, sigh not, and thy weeping For my fated end give o'er; Could it stay me from death's sleeping, Weep I would not have thee more! Mourn not—dying is not dying, Unto those who wish to die; But a hope to the relying, And a change from grief to joy. Who would cling to this base being, That hath any hopes on high; Who would murmur when th' All-seeing Sees 'tis meet that we should die! Haply it were grievous, leaving Life, which should be only joy, But that passions interweaving With its hopes, its hopes destroy. Haply it were cause for mourning, That I lived and die unloved; But that Gricf will touch the scorning, When the scorned is removed. Dying for her, it may grieve me That she never lived for me; Yet when life's last sigh shall leave me, 'Twill be breathed alone for thee— Thee, the only one befriending, Save with lying words of breath— Thee, the only one attending Sorrow's couch and Sickness' death! She who gave the stab that slayeth Should the wound have medicined; But the heart which Love betrayeth Never can be more unkind! Tell her, though for truth I perish, That her falsehood I forgive; And if thought of me she cherish, Let her think that still I live— Though my bones the while be rotten As the hopes I once would trust; And who knew me have forgotten All save that which never must Die with me, but aye-surviving, Give the life that's after death— Fame—the life of life, which living, Crowns me with a deathless wreath! But if then she scorneth proudly Lowly Love and humble Fame, Tell her that the world shall loudly Speak my wrongs, and cry her shame! Let her learn by this love-token, (Humble gift, but ah! 'tis true,) That my vow was only broken When my heart was broken too! Take it, with these tears which gem it, Wept from Passion's ruined heart; And let those who would condemn it, Love like me, and dying part. Had I been a wanton wooer, And adored with feigned excess; Had she loved me warmer, truer— And I loved her wiser, less— Then my life had not been blighted; Then these griefs would not consume; And the broken vows we plighted Had not struck me to the tomb. Hah! death's blood is coldly welling In my heavy, sinking heart; And my soul is proudly swelling Upon wings which yearn to start. Yes—my heart is slowly breaking, And thy cares will end with me; I shall wing where no awaking Brings a morn of misery! Joys were mine, most sweet and ample, Such as youth will ever have; Life had flowers, till she did trample All but those will deck my grave! Hopes I had, high ones and many— Now not one of earth is left; And my heart, once strong as any, Fate hath crushed, and Falsehood cleft! Who would cling to hopeless being, That hath better hopes on high; Who would murmur when th' All-seeing Wills, in mercy, we should die! Let me feel thine hands in dying Clasp my brow, which chills with death; Let me taste thy life-warm sighing Give to my death-gasping breath! And when Silence seals for ever These true lips, do this by me— Kiss and close them, for they never Parted without blessing thee! And my harp, whose plaintive story Drew your innocent young tear, (Once my pain, my joy, my glory,) Lay it on its master's bier; And when Frailty's frame you bury, Place it in this lifeless hand, Which its cords among would hurry, Waking, at its strong command, Songs of war, and sounds of clangor; Lays that were Love's earliest lore; Airs which Madness soothed and Anger,— But will never wake them more! I ask of thee the yearly shedding Of all flowers that garland Spring; Fall them light on life's last bedding, And heaven will bless the offering. Breathe there the hymn that Bard the dearest Framed for lips as pure as thine; And if a spirit's sigh thou hearest, By its sadness know it mine. Sister, fail not to see duly All the rites I ask performed; Adding prayers, from heart as holy As Love's fervour ever warmed. Droop not—sigh not—and thy weeping For my fated end give o'er; Could it stay me from death's sleeping, Weep I would not have thee more! Sure an angel's arms entwined me— Or, my Sister, were they thine? Still, oh still caressing, bind me— Let me still in heaven recline! Nearer, Sister, nearer—nearer— Thou art all that lives of me; Feel my heart's last beat, thou dearer Far than fame, and song, and she— Ah, I read I should not name her, In the scorning of thine eye; Never, as thou lovest me, blame her— Scorn should with Forgiveness die!— Hush thee! There are angels winging Visibly within the room— Come to claim, with joy and singing, What is heaven's from the tomb! Hear'st thou not their heavenly voices, Which have borrowed tones of thine? My soul hears them, and rejoices With an ecstasy divine! Lay me lightly on my pillow, With that gentleness thine own; I can die as calm as billow When the winds have dropt it down. All is past, and all forgiven!— If my hopes have any worth, We shall meet and love in heaven, Though we might not upon earth. Nearer, Sister, nearer—nearer— Thou art all that lives of me; Feel my heart's last throb</field>
