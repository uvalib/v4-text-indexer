      <field name="fulltext">The FIRST Part. And Kick the Gods like Foot-balls as I fly: not Lucian. [Numb. 1.] A DIALOGUE Betweeen MERCURY and the SUN. Mer. Tis the command, Sir Sun of Jove, That for three days you do not move To lengthen out a night for Love. And let the hours that wait on you, Unharness all your Horses too; Then put your Candle out, and go To bed; for Jove will have it so. Sol. What is't that I have done, that he Shou'd thus resolve to punish me? That Gammer Night shou'd bear the sway, And triumph o're her Lord the Day? Mer. That's not the thing, nor is't of state, His business is of greater weight. Sol. Where is he now? don't tell me false. Mer. In Boeotia with little Alce. Sol. Will not one Night allay his fires, And cool his lecherous Desires? Mer. 'Tis not for that, but to compleat, And make a Heroe strong and great, Whom he did t'other day beget. Sol. Much Joy to him, but Mercury, I'le tell you now 'twixt you and I, Such idle things were never done When good old Saturn wore the Crown, He ne're stole out in all his life To occupy his Neighbours Wife, But always kept to Rhea's Coney, And thought her fit to change his Money. Day was day then, no paltry scurvy Punk the World turn'd topsy turvy; For want of Exercising too My Horses, they will Restive grow. Briers and Thorns will choak the way, And men will languish for the day; And all to make some blustering fool. Mer. Hold now, lest he your courage cool. Mean time as I was bid I'le go And charge the Moon to saunter too, That she abandon not Mankind, Lest they the alteration find. A Dialogue between Vulcan and Jupiter. Vulcan. Here is the Ax you bid me get, What am I now to do with it? Jup. Strike hard my head, nay do not wonder, And cleave my aching Jaws asunder. Vul. Sure yo'ave a mighty mind to see If I am mad, then laugh at me. But prethee Jupiter don't joke, And tell me what you mean by th'stroke. Jup. You idle sot, to cleave my scull, And if you do refuse it, fool! I'le swinge you off by fatal Styx! Strike hard, and leave your foolish tricks. For my poor head beats like a Tabor, And achs as if I were in Labor. Vul. Take heed, for faith you now command What I did never understand. You'd better get some Midwife do it, Lest you repent, and after rue it. Jup. Strike boldly Dog, and do your best, And then let me alone for th'rest. Vul. I'le do't 'cause you must be obey'd, Though it was ne're my way of Trade. Have at your head! uds Death and Hell! What's this I see? 'tis wonderful! Well you might have such swinging Pains, While such a Wench was in your Brains. See how she capers o're the stools, As if she'd been at Dancing-schools. And how she brandishes her spear, She almost makes me shake with fear. Well you might be so cross of late, When such a Girl was in your Pate. s'Wounds! she's a strapper of her years, How brisk and handsom she appears; She's very tall and Blew-ey'd, but Her Helmet makes her a pretty slut. Give her to me, I prethee, Jove, She's big enough, for I'm in Love, Jup. With all my heart, I am content, But she will never give consent: For she has vow'd a single Life, And hates the very name of Wife. Vul. Let me alone, since I have got Your word, I'le try her on the spot. Jup. Be rul'd by me, and quit the Place, She'l ne're indure thy sooty Face. Numb. 2. A DIALOGUE Between NEPTUNE and MERCURY. Nep. I'de speak with Jove, Coz. Mercury: Mer. He's busie, sir, Nep. Tell him 'tis I. Mer. Pray be not now s'importunate; If you wou'd see him, you must wait. Nep. Where is he now? is he with's Wife? Mer. No, he's not there upon my life. Nep. Is he with's Boy that he does love? Mer. You'r much mistaken still in Jove. Nep. Where then? and what a doing, tell? Mer. Why truly he's not very well. Nep. Phoogh! that's a Sham, come tell me true, Mer. I am asham'd to tell it you. Nep. Asham'd to tell it to your kin? Mer. I beg your pardon, he lies In. Nep. How! was he an Hermaphrodite? I ne're perceiv'd it by this Light, Nor did his Belly big appear. Mer. No, he had ne're much aching there. Nep. Was it where he Minerva bred? Who from his brain was brought to bed, He has a Teeming Logger-head. Mer. No, he in's thigh the child did bear: Nep. How! is he fruitful ev'ry where? Mer. Juno being fill'd with Jealousie, Did put a Trick on Semele, Perswading her, pray mind the Story, To lie with Jove in all his Glory, Who being possess'd with fierce Desire, Strait set the Room and her on fire. For when (you know) he's arm'd with Thunder, He does destroy things to a wonder. All he cou'd do, things were so spoil'd, Was just the saving of the child; For which he in his thigh made room, When bloody hot it dropt from th'Womb. And now he's once more free again, But wonderfully weak with pain: Or as you 'ave often heard it sed, He's very finely brought a bed. Nep. Now I cou'd laugh until I burst, But pray where must the child be nur'st? Mer. Why I have carry'd him to Nysa To be brought up (pray mind what I say) The Nymphs of him great care will take, And use him well for's Fathers sake. Nep. And Jove after this mighty Do, Is Father to't, and Mother too? Mer. Yes, yes, but I've no leisure now To let you any further know; For I must go and buy some strings, And other necessary Things To bind him up, some Harts-horn Jelly, Caudle and what is good for's belly; To nourish him, poor Mercury! Thou must I fear, his dry-Nurse be. With other things unknown to you, So honest Nuncle Nep. adieu. A Dialogue between the River Enipeus &amp; Neptune. Enip. Faith Neptune you were much to blame, T'assume my shape and take my name: T'abuse my Mistress, faith you were. Nep. No, rather you were too severe, You were unjust unto her love, Since she so very kind did prove: Which bred in her a thousand fears, And overwhelm'd her still in tears, For on your banks she ev'ry day; Th'Oblations of her love did pay. Enip. And must you therefore cheat her thus? Nep. 'Twas pity made me Courteous, Besides I pleas'd the Beauteous she. Enip. 'Tis true because she thought 'twas me: But when she found out who 'twas Acted, She'd almost like t'have run distracted; Besides I'm mad that any he, Shou'd Reap the Joys belong to me. Nep. 'Tis you'r to blame, and wond'rous base T'abuse so fine, so sweet a face; Therefore for th'future learn t'improve, The short, but Pretious hours of Love. Numb. 3. A DIALOGUE Between MENIPPUS and TROPHONIUS in the Presence of AMPHILOCTUS. Men. How comes it, since yo'ave lost your breath, And falln into the hands of Death, That idle, silly, Country People, Shou'd build to you a Church and Steeple; And then, as if 'twere such a Prize As to a God, t'you sacrifice. Tro. Am (I d'you think) Accountable For th'foolish Whimsies of the Rabble? Men. Well, but the People, ne're had don it, If you had not put them upon it, You made your ends, and interest of it, And told 'em all, you were a Prophet. And like a true Dissenter, strove To break th'Allegiance, sworn to Jove. Tro. It does behove, Amphiloctus, (Whom you see now is here with us,) To give an Answer unto you; And tell you all the Meaning too, For my part 'tis well known I can, Prove I am something more than man: And can foretell (like any thing,) And am, or wou'd be more than King. No Heroe e're had such a Name, I was the first i'th' Rank of fame, And ever scorn'd to Crouch, or bend To Father, Unkle, Wife, or Friend. But one wou'd think, by what you say, You'd ne'er bin in Labadia: For there I ne're cou'd walk abroad, But still attended by a Crowd, Hollowing, and hooping as they went, As if they'd rend the Firmament. Long live Trophonius! they wou'd cry, While Jove past unregarded by; All this wou'd sure have made it plain, That I was born a God, (Again) You cannot tho misdoubt, that I Am (now) of Heavens Progeny So must believe, (tho ne're the near now) That I am more than Man; a Hero. Men. There was no need of being there, One might have heard on't any where: Nor of doing things that thou hast done, Thou foolish, base, rebellious Son, Dull, Canting, Idle, Logger-head; To make't appear that thou art dead, Nor of doing what the Foolish do, When e're they Sacrifize to you, Or to explain that thour't more base, Than any of thy God-like race; Hast more Imposture, and less Wit, Than e're was found in Hero yet? But now I do Conjure thee by Thy Canting, or thy Prophecy, To tell me what by Hero's meant, For I am wholly ignorant: Tro. A Hero is a thing between A God, and Man (that ne're was seen) Or rather both together join'd, The Body, Man, the God, the Mind. Men. If so, pray tell me then sweet heart, What is come of thy better part? For thou'rt of all, that's good bereft, And not one spark of Grace hast left. Else thou such things woud'st ne're have don, As Elbowing Jove, from off his Throne, For thou did'st that, which was the same, By robbing him, of his good name, And drawing People from his shrine, To make 'em sacrifize to thine. Tro. Away with this, but you wou'd know, Where my diviner part is now? 'Tis in Bœotia, where yet, My old Acquaintance, worship it: Men. Well I don't understand, what you, By all this trade can mean to do, But thus far, I may truly say, I do believe you're out o'th'way, And if I must, it plainly tell, I'me sure you are Entire in Hell. Numb. 4. A Dialogue between Diogenes and Pollux Dio. Since Pollux 'tis next morn' thy right, To visit Earth, and view the light; Bid Menippus the Philosopher, The little brook that parts us Cross over, Without delay, and make hast hither, That we may Crack our sides together, For he that here, can't Laugh his fill, Shall ne're laugh more, by my good will; Provided that he does not tell ye, He has already broke his belly: For surely there he'has cause enough, If he be not Pease-Porrige Proof. And tell him tho the folk about The place he dwells, are much in doubt How People fare when they are dead, Of which they nothing know, but Dread, Here's none below, but what still keep tick With faith; for Hell undoes a Skeptick. He'll wonder too, when he comes down, To see that men of high Renown, Shou'd be no more than Ev'ry Gaffer, And onely subjects here of Laughter: And hardly known, but by their bawling; A sort of Hellish Caterwawling: Then bid him bring his Crusts to feed on, With other things that he'll have need on, For here is nothing to be got, That's fitting for the Spit or Pot: Nay here one may, (altho in hast,) As soon ones Neck break, as ones fast. Poll. Pray sir don't make of me a Tool, And send me like an April Fool, But tell me now before I go, By what mark I the Spark shall know? Dio. Hast thou not seen below the Skie, Men that cry Silk, and Taffaty, With tatter'd Cloak on one Arm Tost, So Patcht, th'Original is lost, Who find out all the strong Bub places And wear it's livery on their faces: Just such a one is he, you can Not be mistaken in the man; At Corinth you will find him fooling, Or else at Athens Ridiculing, For the Philosophers he hates, And with his Banter breaks their Pates, Because they bounce, and brag they know, The truth of ev'ry thing below, And understand too, those above, As well as Mercury, or Jove, When they are not so wise by half, As Goatham's Mayor, or Waltham's Calf. Poll. If he be such a one, no doubt But I shall quickly find him out; But have you nought for me to tell The Grave Philosophers from Hell Dio. Yes, yes, I have, come let me see; Bid 'em leave studying Sophistry; Idle Disputes, and Arguments, Which nothing breeds but discontents; Bid 'em forbear the search of Nature And meddle each, with his own Matter, And speak their knowledge, at a word And not be Fools thus on Record: Poll. And then they'll say that I'm a fool, And never learnt my book at School, So call me Dunce, and swear that I Don't understand Philosophy. Dio. Tell 'em that they must cry and bawl, As loud, as at a Funeral The Irish do, and ev'ry whit As true, as theirs is all Deceit. Poll. Well, I'le remember what you say, And all your wise Commands obey. Dio. As for the mighty men of worth, Tell 'em I bid you thus hold forth. Why do you give your selves such Pain, About what's perishing and vain? What signifies your pomp and state? Your being Noble, Rich, or Great? Your vast Attendance, and Calashes? When you are faln to Dust and Ashes; And Threed-bare Vicar going first, Cries here's the hole, and in you must. And tell the Smock-fac't Megibus, And the Wrestler Damoxenus, That here strong Back, nor able Thighs, Nor curled Hair, nor sparkling Eyes, Nor all the Charms adorn'd by Art, In this place signifie a Fart. Poll. It shall be done, and free from Passions, I'le do your hearty commendations. Dio. Go to the Poor, whom you will see, Groaning beneath their misery, And comfort 'em, and tell 'em all, They must no longer howl and bawl, Since there's no difference when we're dead, Between the Poor, and Crowned head; For Monsieur Mors, that ancient Traveller Was always known, to be a Leveller, And tell each Spartan to his face, They are all degenerate and base; That those who us'd to fight with Half-staff, Are dwindl'd now into a Falstaff. Poll. If you speak ill of them, good Sir, I will not be your Messenger; But all the rest I will obey, To a Cow's Thumb, (as one may say.) Dio. Well, do in that as likes you best, But pray be punctual in the rest. Numb. 5. A DIALOGUE Between ACHILLES and ANTILOCHUS. Ant. What's that you said unto Ulysses? Sure you have here no factious Wishes, That you had rather be as Poor, As those who beg from door to Door; That want a Belly full of Bread, And han't a hole to hide their Head: Than or'e the shades a Ruler be, So much you still hate Monarchy; But faith and troth you don't do well To preach these Sentiments in Hell, For here are none but will obey: And Reverence to their Monarch pay; Nor are you worthy of your Name, Or of the Place from whence you came, Who like a hardy fool did Chuse Your life and fame, and all to lose. Such was your foolish Zeal, (or Spite) Than live and do what's Just and Right, Though in full Splendour and Delight. Ach. All this is true, faith honest Tory, But then I thought that worldly Glory, Was th'onely Summum Bonum tho I now find that 'twas nothing so: No, notwithstanding Father Homer, Said it was so, upon his Honour; With other Modern Poets too, But I find none of them spoke true; Here Strength, and Handsomness, (that rare thing) Don't signifie one single Farthing; Nor can I find the Grecians (hear me) Do Reverence or Trojans fear me. Nor is here any difference neither, But just like Birds of the same feather, We're all alike and flock together. Therefore I cou'd wish that I were To breath a little Grecian Air, Tho at the hazard, (I must tell you) Of being but some little Fellow: Anti. Come, come, leave off this murmuring trade The laws o'th' World must be obey'd. And Nature too must have her swing And all Obey Great Order's King: Besides your mighty Men are too, All gon, or dead, as well as you. Achi. Antilochus it is in vain, To comfort me, I tell you plain, For I am fill'd with strange Regrets, Which thoughts of life in me begets. And you are troubled too (I see,) Tho you dissemble more than I: If she not daring to complain When overwhelm'd with Fear and Pain. Ben't full as foolish, and as vain, As th'little tricks, that Children play Upon a Summers Holy-day. Anti. 'Tis Resolution rather tho To suffer with a serious Brow; Yet yours was not so I (Profess,) But onely a Fool-hardiness. Nor is it wisedom to Complain, When by it we no good can gain; And it is better much, to bear Ones sufferings with a chearfull Air, So one but leave unto his Nation, An honest, spotless, Reputation, Than to become a laughing-stooll, By vain complaints to ev'ry Fooll. Numb. 6. A DIALOGUE Between ZEPHYRUS and NOTUS. No. The Cow you see so briskly move, Friend Zephyrus, was Whore to Jove; Whom Mercury, his Man, is driving To Ægypt, there to graze her Living: Ze. I know't, and then she was a Maiden, As good as ever Leg was lay'd-on; But Juno's plaguy Jealousie Has since transform'd her, as you see. No. And think'st thou Jupiter does know it? Sure if he did, he wou'd not do it; Ze. Yes, yes, he knows it well enough, And has forbidden us to puff 'Till she's arriv'd, and out of fear; Besides she is to lie Inn there; Her bastard too, (altho' it odd is,) Will be a God, and she a Goddess; No. A Cow a Goddess, that's a Bull; Ze. Jove can do any thing you Fool: Or'e sailers she will govern too, And what she pleases we must do: 'Tis very hard, we must not roar But when commanded by a Whore. No. Nay then, betimes let's court the Minion, To get into her good Opinion: Our Interest says it must be done, And all Men court the Rising-sun. Ze. See, she's arriv'd upon the plain, And is a Woman too again, And goes no longer now on four But walks like any other Whore. No. This is a Miracle! for now She' has nought remaining of the Cow, And Mercury to wait on her Has turn'd himself into a Cur. Ze. Let's curb our Curiosity For there must in't some Mistery be, But Mercury better knows than we. A Dialogue betwixt Jupiter, Esculapius and Hercules. Jup. Leave off, i'll have no more such stirs, Always a quarrelling ye Curs? No sooner I sit down to table in The Parlour, but you fall to squabling, Growling and snarling just like Dogs, One might as well go eat with Hogs; Her. Why father is it fit that he, Damn'd Quack, shou'd take the wall of me? Escu. No Quack you Ruffain as you flout, But God of Physick, absolute: A thousand times your Betters too, You Clumsie Lubber, Boutefeau! Her. Betters! you Clod-Pate undertaker, This must not do, you Piss-pot shaker; Tho your dull Brains were dasht with Thunder, And then restor'd, the greater Wonder. Escu. It much becomes you Scoundrel tho To jeer me with my dying so, When you on Oeta, pray compare Were burnt alive, as Wizards are. Her. Mine was a voluntary Prank Thou dull Quack-salving Mountebank: After the Monsters I had hurl'd To several Deaths, who'd plagu'd the World; Whilst thou, dull swaggering Ignoramus By canting on a Stage grew famous, And bantring in a Purple-cloak, So cheating honest Country-folk. Escu. But when you came to us so mauld, Grill'd, scorcht, and roasted, fry'd, and scawld, I was your Docter, (Beast,) to cure ye Altho you cannot since endure me: And now I think on't (by the by,) I never was an Hoftler, I; Nor was I servant to a Whore, To make me spin from door to Door; And if my task I did not do, Be beaten with the Distaff too, Nor did I (slay upon my life) My little Children and my Wife, As thou didst lately do, foul-beast! Her. Stop your Gally-pot-mouth you'd best, Or else Jove's self shall not secure ye, From my inveterate Rage and Fury; I'll make thee cut a Caper down, From Heaven to Earth (dull senseless Clown;) Which shall so shake thy Adle-brains, That thou with all thy Art and Pains, To cur't, shall find enough to do, Tho thou art good at probing too. Jup. Leave off damn'd Dogs, or else uds boors! I'll turn ye both out of my Doors: The Docter's oldest, therefore pray You Clubster, let him have the way. Numb. 7. A DIALOGUE Between MERCURY and CHARON. Mer. Prithee Tarpaulin let us see, How much thou art in debt to me? Least we shou'd both forget it, come, And let's cast up the total summ; For if we shou'd mistake a Groat, Thoud'st fret, and never mind thy boat. Cha. Reckon Mercury? for my part, I am content with all my heart. Mer. Imprimis, for thee I lay'd out To buy an Anchor for thy boat, Twenty five pence (in ready Dust) For honest Swabber I'll be just. Cha. So much d'you say? (I'll vow and swear,) As things go now, that's very dear. Mer. Why faith and troth, what e're you think, It Cost so much, in ready Chink. Item, (let me see,) two pence more For that, to which, you tye the Oar. Cha. That's very well, to th'other score (Pray be exact,) set two pence more. Mer. Item, a Needle I did buy, Which cost me, four pence half-penny, To mend the sails, last storm we had; Cha. Add them together now my lad. Mer. Item, For Pitch, and Tar, and Nails, And a small Rope to hoist the sails, Just ten pence I laid out for you, Cha. That's very reas'nable I vow. Mer. And this is all I think (dear Chroney) But prithee when wilt pay the Money? Cha. Why truly friend, (I won't harrangue, thee,) But if I have a farthing, hang me: Yet if the times do mend, I swear, And there shou'd come a Plague, or War, That so I might a little juggle, And now and then the Custome smuggle, I'll pay thee ev'ry farthing (know me) That thou wilt say that I now owe thee. Mer. And i'th mean time I must by th'Loss: Sit down, with folded Arms a-Cross And wish that Plagues and Mischiefs may, Take half the wicked World away, Before you'll able be to pay me, Faith 'tis not fair, you shou'd delay me. Cha. I shan't be able troth before, (Friend Mercury) to pay thy Score. Mer. I'de rather ne're be paid by thee, Than all those strange Misfortunes see; But this does put into my head, A thing relating to the dead; Why those dye now, shou'd differ so, From those folk, who dy'd long ago; For then they all were brisk and strong, Plump, fleshy, vigorous, and young. And seldom with a body whole, But cut and slasht from feet to poll; With darts and spears, and many a thwack, Oft' lookt like th'man i'th' Almanack. Whereas they now are little things, Most dying of their surfeitings; Pale, wan, and weak, and hardly able To go a hi-lone, by a Table. Some kill'd by Wine, debauch'd with stum Or drinking, Supernaculum Others with something else, (but Mum) Some have been sent too, by their friends To bring about their private ends. Others have suffer'd by their heirs, While some have pin'd away with cares. Cha. I do not wonder (honest friend) That Int'rest shou'd so many send; For 'tis a hard thing now to get Ones own, tho prov'd, by law a debt: Therefore much more, to get it by Ones Labour, or ones Industry. Mer. Wonder not than, (for well you know me) I spoke oth' money, that you owe me. Numb. 8. A DIALOGUE Between MENIPPUS and CHIRON. Men. Chiron I've often heard it told That thou did'st wish ('fore thou wast old) Death wou'd thy flesh and spirit sever Tho thou had'st leave to live for ever: Come prithee tell me why thou wast So fond of Death, and in such hast? That thou thy self shoud'st break the Bonds Of Life; and fall by thy own hands, As if thou'd'st weary bin of breath, 'Cause I see no such Charms in Death. Chi. I'll tell thee, if thou wilt not teaz me, Something fell out, that did not please me, Which was the cause I wou'd not stay. Men. Were you not glad t'enjoy the Day? Chi. No, I had too much discontent, Men. And did'st thou ne're for it repent? Chi. No, I was never yet so vain, And 'tis as little to complain. Besides 'tis dull to live, since we In life have no Diversity, For still we do, (to our great Pain) The same things o're and o're again; We eat and drink and to our sorrow, We drink and eat agen to Morrow; To Night we sleep, and dream, and then Next night we do the same agen, Thirsting, Drinking, Eating, Hunger So tyred me I'de live no longer. Men. But how did you support your Death, When your for it, had swopt your Breath? Chi. Without a Grudge, or was I troubl'd, For here my Pleasures all are doubl'd? Here's no Ambition, no great places, No haughty looks, nor bold Menaces. No striving to be Rich, or great But all's Hail-fellow here, well met. 'Tis like a Pop'lar-state, for here No one must huff or domineer; Where ev'ry Cobler is as free And of as high Nobility, As any man dare shew his face, Or live, in such a Govern'd place: And what care I (for my delight) Whether it be or day or night, And then we'ave this advantage too; We neither eat nor drink below, Nor are we Plagu'd with Thirst or Hunger, (Which than a stone Wall's counted stronger) Or with any other Clogs of Life, Or with that Cursed plague a Wife; Obedience unto friends, or kin, Or any other idle sin. Nor do we Covet this man's Coney, Or that man's house or Patrimony, Here we are never wanting neither Of shelter, from the stormy Weather, And let the frost be ne're so furious, Unto our Poor 'tis ne're Injurious. Nor do they howl, or bawl, for Bread, Or are the wealthy surfeited. But all are here alike and free from mortal Inconveniency. Men. Chiron take heed you do not do What you wou'd willingly eschew, And so relapse (as if decoy'd) Into the fault you wou'd avoid: For if thy life (to thee) was pain By doing the same things or'e again, Sure now thou'st 'cause to grieve since we In Hell, have no variety. Chi. Tell me Menippus (if it Please thee) What I must do to make me Easie. Men. Why, what was done in former Ages To gain Content by th'Antient Sages, And to believe what can't be cur'd In life, or death, may be endur'd. Numb. 9. [Tuesday Feb. 19??. 1684.] A DIALOGUE Between ÆACUS, PROTESILAUS, MENELAUS and PARIS. Æa. By Pluto! I demand the Cause Why thou dost thus, Protesilaus? No sooner thou art enter'd Hell in, But straight thou Kick'st and Buffets Helen; And fal'st upon her in such manner, As if thou'd'st make a Devil on her. Pro. Furies and Hell! pray is not she, The cause of all my misery? Such Wheed'ling things, the Baggage did do, That my poor Wife liv'd (like) a Widdow; Besides my Family was spoyl'd, For by her means I had no Child. Æa. Ud's Death! bang him who was the cause, That (to'ther Cuckold) Menelaus, Who to those Mischiefs led thee on, By which thou fairly, art undon? Pro. By Heaven! that is truly said, Have at thy Plotting Loggerhead! Men. Hold, hold: you are beside the saddle Or else your Coxcombs brains are addle; Tis not with me, but Monsieur Paris, (If you will do the thing that fair is,) You ought to Quarrel with, for he; Sans Right of hospitallity Debauch't my Wise, and (as you knew well,) Ravish't away my precious Jewel. The Bastard like a Thief wou'd come I'th' Night, when I was drunk as Drum, And firk the Gipsie'bout the Bum. My servants bribe, and for a Whimsie Wou'd often hide himself i'th' Chimnie, With Scaling Ladders, (made of Garters,) He'd often mount into her Quarters. For this he well deserves a banging, and (for what else I know) a hanging The Trojans reason have to hate him. The Greeks when er'e they can, will beat him. Both sides so hate the Cursed Elf That now he may go hang himself For want of one to do the favour, (So save some body else, a Labour,) All that have lost their lives of late, Have reason too the Fool to hate. He led them on to their undoing And on himself and them brought Ruine. Pro. Thou doubly damn'd to Hell! with Clods, I'll break thy Head, by all the God's: I'll strangle then away thy breath, For gulling Men so into Death, Nay, flinch not Dog, for I'll assure thee, Now, thou sha't feel my Rage and Fury. Paris. Truly I think Protesilaus Your angry now without a Cause. For you your self a Votary Are to the self same Deity: Besides you know we're forc'd to do What e're he's pleas'd to lead us to. Pro. 'Tis true, that God is much to blame, And is th'chief Cause of all our shame. Æa. He might have said tho if he wou'd Thou drew'st upon thy self thy blood, Since thou must needs run pushing on, To purchase Honour and Renown, And so wast chopt to death (before) Thou wast well landed on the shore, Forgetting that thou had'st a Whore. Pro. I rather shou'd complain of Heaven, To leave me thus at six and seven; And Destiny that cursed Jade, That I shou'd now be thus betray'd; Nay, faith and troth it was not Civil, To send one headlong thus to th'Devil. Æa. Blame and accuse whom e're you please, But let these People live at ease; And leave off all this foolish stuff, For Hell without it's bad enough. Numb. 10. A DIALOGUE Between PLUTO and MERCURY. Tuesday Feb. 26??. 1683/4. Pluto. Merc'ry do'st know that Fellow there? Who's old, and rich, but wants an Heir, On whom so many people wait In hopes he'll leave 'em his Estate. Mer. D'you mean the Sicyonian? Pluto. The very same Grey-hair'd old Man. And prithee Merc'ry do not grudge To be unto his Age a Crutch; And let him live and Guzzle on, Untill those Fools are dead and gone; Who after him so often dance, Expecting his Inheritance. Do this and you'll obliege me too, In troth you will, I prithee do? Mer. No, 'tis unjust to kill the Young, And let the Aged live so long. Besides, the like was never known, 'Tis turning Nature upside down. Pluto. Come nimble Tongue you are mista'ne, 'Tis very just as I'le explain: For why shou'd they have his Estate, Who by no way to him Relate; And 'fore his Face to gain his favour Desire he may live for ever? Make Vows in publick for his Health, As if they valu'd not his Wealth: When privately they wish him cold, That they may share his Bags of Gold. Therefore good Merc'ry see it done, He ought t'out-live 'em ev'ry one: And tho perhaps it make 'em snort all, Let 'em believe he is Immortall. Mer. And now I think on't faith they do Deserve to be all Punish'd so, Because each Dog may have his due. But that which pleases me the most, Is to observe how they are tost, By him from Pillar (back) to Post. For still 'fore them he seems a dying, With all his Fam'ly round him Crying; Tho when they're gone he's very well, And drinks, and eats a hearty Meal: And this to make 'em all redouble Their Assiduity and Trouble; That as their hopes (of Death) increases, They may improve their kind Caresses; For he much pleasure takes to teaze 'em, And is resolved ne'er to please 'em. But now I am afraid at last They'll want the Means to break their Fast, By over eagerness to get Another's Wealth to make 'em Great. Pluto. Therefore because they've bin so vain, Let him be brisk and young again. To boast and brag let them have no cause, But make him strong again like Jolaus. And for their parts let me Intreat it, That to the Guts they may be fretted, To see their greedy hopes defeated. In Dreams let him his Wealth be sharing, Thinking them dead as any Herring, But when they waking find it not, Let each man cut his proper Throat. Mer. But Master Pluto (I assure you) You ought not to instruct Mercury; Come let me see, (then he did wink, And cry'd) they're seven just (I think) I'le bring 'em all, one after t'other, (Each Son of Whore, or honest Mother.) Pluto. D'b'uy and then you'll please me too, But pray take heed in what you do, And let the old Man (free from cares) Out-live's Imaginary Heirs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Second Part. ? Bully the Gods, And make 'em afraid to Thunder. A Fragment. A DIALOGUE Between MENIPPUS and CERBERUS. Men. Thou Great Triumvirate of Pates! And Porter of th'Infernal Gates; Tell me, when Socrates came down, What Face and Humour, wore the Clown? Deal frankly with me, since we are, (As well as Cyniques) Chronies here: For as you are a God, you can; Or bark like Dog, or talk like Man. Cer. At first he sullen was, and Mute, Seem'd very bold, and Resolute; And fain wou'd pass for one that ne'er Was shokt by death, or shak'd by fear: And did behave himself, as well, At's death, as any he, in Hell: But when within these shades his foot He'ad set, (and drawn the other to't) The ('fore so stout, then) trembling Spark, Did quake and shake, to see't so Dark. And when my twice-three Ears I shook, He lookt just like one Thunder-strook. But when I snarl'd at him, and groul'd, And with my gaping three-mouths howl'd: Snapt at his Shins, (and's Stockins Spoyl'd) He cry'd (and bellow'd) like a Child; Tormenting's self, as if he had, Been drunk (with Nants) or Raving Mad. Men. If so, as far as I can gather, Than Valiant, he a Cheat was rather, And did not when he hither Coasted Despise and bear death as he boasted. Cer. Yes, when he saw (I must confess) That on he must without redress, He shew'd some Courage, and ('tis said;) He did not seem to be dismay'd; But bore it with as bold a Brow, As the occasion wou'd allow; And lookt, as if 'twas not Necessity, But pure Chance-Medly in Adversity: Tho I believ'd 'twas partly done, To be admir'd by th'Lookers on: Or, to beget the Reputation, Of Stout, he dy'd that surly fashion. The same too may be said of most, Who for that Cause, came to our Coast: They're wond'rous Valiant just before, But when they come to th'very Door; The boldest Spirit of 'em fails, (And look like Dogs, that hang their Tails.) Men. But Cerb'rus what canst say of me? When I came down to visit thee. Cer. Thou art a Worthy brave Philosopher, And boldly didst the Ferry cross over, As Great Diogenes did before thee, (If there be any truth in Story). I'le swear for thee, thou cam'st not here Unwillingly, by force, or fear, But in a chearful manner, Gay, Tickling, and Smiling all the way; As if you had nought else to do, But to be merry here below; While others in this place are Weeping, And alwayes such a Noise are Keeping; One had as good be in a Mill, (In troth 'tis true) as live in Hell. A Dialogue between Jupiter, and Ganymede. Jup. How is't, my pretty One? Come, speak, Now I have neither Claw, nor Beak; You'l Kiss me sure: you need not Fear, Nothing, my Love shall Hurt you here. Gan. Where are they then? I'me zure that you, A Hugeous Eagle, was but now: Vor as I did my Vathers Zheep, Upon our Vurzie Common keep; You Zwopt me up, while I lay Kicking, As if I'de been a Tiny Chicken. How cou'd you do it, pray? Vor now, You look as our Town-Zhepherds do; And are a Man, I vancy too. Jup. I'me neither Man, nor Eagle, Love; But King of all the the Pow'rs Above: Who so Transform'd my self to be, More Strong and Fit, to Carry thee. Gan. But tell me Grandzir, if you can, Who 'tis you are? Or are you Pan? Yet now I think more on the Matter, He looks as Wild, as any Zatyr. Horns on his Head, and Cloven Paw, With Hairy Feet, and Pipe of Straw; The only Marks, I know him by. Jup. Know'st thou no other Deity? Gan. Not I, d'you think I'de tell you Lies: But ev'ry Year we Zacrivize, To him a Goat, in his own Cave, Because he zhou'd our Cattle Zave; But you, vor all you're zuch a Ztrapper, I vear, are but zome zly Kidnapper; Who Get your Living by Decoys, And Mony make, of Little Boys. Jup. Didst thou ne'er hear, of Mighty Jove? Whose Temple is in Ida's Grove, Who Lightens Heaven at his Pleasure; And Thunders People so together. Gan. O yes, is't you who make that Noise, And Vrighten Women zo, and Boys: To whom my Vather, ev'ry year, Does Zacrivize a Ram for Vear, He shou'd make Bread, and Butter Dear. But why did you znatch me away? The Woolf, will all my Lamkins, Zlay. Jup. Thou think'st of nothing, but thy Sheep; Thou'rt now Immortal, and must keep Dull Brutes no more; but Live with me, And ever keep Gods Company. Gan. But won't you zet me down again? Jup. No: All my Labour's then in Vain. Gan. But my poor Dad, will Nangry be, If he his Boy shou'd never zee; And Beat me 'cause I left my Zheep. Jup. Fear not, I will thee alwayes keep. Gan. Don't keep me now; I pray now, don't, I wonnot ztay now, that I won't. Yet, if you will but let me go; I'le Zacrivize a Ram to you. Jup. How simple is this pretty Boy; Come ben't dismay'd, Chear up my Joy: You must forget all things below, My Nubsie, you're in Heaven now, And may do good unto your Friends; And never think on private Ends. You shall no longer be a Boy, But have what e'er the God's Enjoy. Instead of Butter, Cheese, and Whey, Have Nectar, and Ambrosia: And have your Star amongst the Rest, And Shine as Glorious, as the Best. Gan. That's mighty Brave: But Zir, if I Wou'd Play, Who'll keep me Company? For when I was on Ida's Hill, I had my Playvellows at Will. Jup. Cupid, my Lad, shall Play with thee, If thou wilt Brisk, and Chearful be: For he's as Arch a Wagg, as thou; But mind no more the Things below. Gan. I marry Zir! that's pure indeed, But have you any Vlocks to Veed? Else what shall I do here Above? Jup. Thou shalt be Cup-bearer to Jove, And fill him Nectar little Love. Gan. Is that zo good as Milk, and Whey? Jup. Better, my Joy by far, than they; And thou shalt Drink it ev'ry day. Gan. Where must I Lye a Nights, Zir tho? With Cupid, my Vine Playvellow: Jup. No, no, with me; my pretty One. Gan. What, are you 'vraid to lye alone? Jup. 'Tis better with a pretty Lad; Gan. Zure you are Drunk good Zir, or Mad; What good can Pretty do a Bed? When Zleep is got into ones Head. Jup. Sleep's not so Pleasant, when Alone; Two is much better (Dear) than One. Gen. When I lay with my Vather, he Did alwayes vex, and vret at me; Because I zuch a doo did keep, Tumbling, and talking in my Zleep: And Puncht him on the zides and head, And kickt him almost out oth' Bed, That he wou'd zend me to my Mother, I allwayes kept zuch ztir and pother, If you took me vor this Idain, You'l quickly zet me down again. Jup. I than thy Father love thee more, I'le kiss and handle thee all o're: Besides, I've other things in store. Gan. You may do what you will, and keep What ztir you pleaze, but I will Zleep. Jup. We'll talk of this another day. Here! take him (Mercury) away, And see'm drink Imortality, That he may serve's in Quallity; Of Cupbearer, and teach the Fool, To make a Leg, and give the Bowl. A Dialogue between Crates and Diogenes. Cra. Did you know that Old Cinque and Cater, Who such a stir made on the Water; With Ships and Boats of ev'ry size, As if th'Sea he'd Monopolize? He liv'd at Corinth in the High House, His Name was (let me see) Mærichus; Whose Cousin was, as great a Rascal As ever drank of Wine a flasque all Believe me, or his Neighbours, ask All; And full as Rich, and Old as he, And had as much Frigidity; As near, and Covetous he was, And ev'ry whit as much an Ass: Repeating still that piece of Honour, Deliver'd to the World by Homer: Into his Ears, Do thou kill me, Chuse which thou wilt, or I'le Kill thee: 'Tis pitty that we both shou'd live, Let him take all who must Survive; For you must know, they had made over Their whole Estates to one another; Consulted all the South-sayers, Conjurers and Astrologers, To know whom Monsieur Mors his Worship Wou'd give it all, by Survivorship. But these Damn'd scoundrels, one wou'd Wheedle And then the other Trout, they'd tickle; So both of them a while were eas'd The neither of 'em Thro'ly pleas'd; For all those Fellows at the best, Are Cheats, and prate for Interest. Dio. But what became on't, Prithee Crates. Cra. Why I will tell thee what their fate was: They both together on a day, Dropt into th'Grave (as one may say) And left their Riches all to them, They ne're so much as in a Dream, Did ever think of, or the (Wench-on) Conjurers did ever Mention. Dio. I'm glad on't Faith, it makes me Jolly, And much delights me: but such Folly, By thou and I, was ne're Committed; Or were we e're so basely Cheated: (Such foolish idle things, but mean is,) I never wish'd that Antisthenes Wou'd die, and leave his Oaken Plant To me, tho I stood then in want: Or, didst thou ever wish for mine, That Tub, and Scrip, might both be thine. Crates. That's true, because we were content With that small Stock kind Fortune sent; And I thought 'twas enough t'Inherit Thy Virtues, and thy God-like Spirit: As thou had'st done, on the same Score, By Great Antisthenes before. Which Wealth is more to be desir'd, Tho not of late so much Admir'd; You ne're saw any come to us, To learn how to be Virtuous; Whereas you see they never fail Pursuing Riches, Tooth and Nail; While others striving to be Great, Admiring Titles, Pomp and State; Will live on Pottage, Herbs and Carrot, So they may hurry't in a Chariot, Attended on by tatter'd Pages, With Lanthorn Jaws, starv'd at Board-Wages, Which ne're was known in former Ages. Dio. It is no Wonder this to see, Their Souls are spoyl'd by Luxury: They're void of Honour, and so Vain, They cannot any good contain: They're like th'Bellides here in Hell, Whose Barrel runs out faster still, Than they have Power and Strength to fill: But shou'd you dare to be so bold As Venture, but to touch their Gold, So much to good men they are helps, You might as well a Lyoness Rob of Whelps. Crates. Besides, this Comfort too we have, We carry all our Wealth to th'Grave; Whilest they (than us) do bring no more, So leave behind 'em all their Store: And honest Charon (if they've any) Does ease 'em of their last poor Penny: VVhich is thrust in their Mouths by those Who put 'em on their Bur'ing Cloaths. A Dialogue between Charon, Mercury, (a Company of Dead Men,) Menippus, Charmoleus, Lampichus, Damasias, a Philosopher, and a Rhetorician. Charon. Come Listen, All, to what I say, My Ferry-Boat's gone to Decay; It Leaks, is Old, and very Rotten, Besides, my Bench and Oars are Broken; Therefore sit still, and Trim it well, Or else, twon't Carry you to Hell: For here's so many come together, That if we shou'd but have foul Weather, Their Luggage is so very Great, They will my Wherry Over-set: Then those that cannot Swim, will be, In a pretty Pickle presently. The Dead. What shall we do than, prithee Charon? For to get over Acheron? Charon. I'le tell you, you must come as bare, As when you first breath'd Grecian Air; And leave your Trumpery on the Shore, And ne'r so much as think on't more. And since my Boat's so very Small, 'Tis well if then it hold ye All. Be it thy Charge too, Messenger, T'Examine ev'ry Passenger. That none but half-Stay'd Fellows come, Expecting in my Wherry Room. Take Care too, and be sure you Mind 'em, To leave their Baggage all behind 'em; Then on the Ladder stand Equipt, And force 'em all to enter Stript. Mercury, I will Obey, and now let's see, Who 'tis comes first oth' Company. Menip. 'Tis I, Menippus, who am come, To be a little Troublesome. Tho I have thrown into the Lake, My Staff, and Wallet, for the sake Of easy Waftage: And 'tis well, I brought no Gown, nor Sursingle; (Tho if the Naked Truth were known, In all my Life, I ne'r had One.) Mercury. Enter Menippus to the Sculler, Thou best of Men, before 'tis fuller; And take the Highest Place, that thou, From thence may'st see, what others do; But who is this that comes to see us? Charmoleus. I am the Lovely Charmoleus, Who for a Kiss, took as much Money's, As wou'd have Purchast'd Fifty Coneys. Mercury. Cast off your Beauty, and your Pride, Your Lips, Red-Cheeks, and Hair beside: And do not think to enter in To Hell, and sleep in a Whole Skin; But pull it off, and do not Venture. 'Tis Well, so now you'r fit to Enter. But what Grim Sir is that, when Dead, Dares Venture with a Crown On's Head? Lampichus. I am Prince Lampichus of Gela. Mercury. Why thus Loaden, prithee Fellow? Lampichus. Why shou'd a Prince come Naked too? Mercury. A Prince shou'd not; but Dead Men do. Therefore put off your Ornaments. Lampichus. There Lye, my Rich Habiliments: Mercury. And you must put off too, (beside,) Your Haughty-Looks, your State, and Pride; For if they Enter, you shall see, They'l Sink the Boat immediately. Lampichus. Let me but keep my Robe, and Crown: Mercury. No, you must even them lay down. Lampichus. There then, what more have I to do? Mercury. You must put off your Fury too. To Wit, and Knowledge, your pretence, Your Cruelty, and Insolence. Lampichus. See, I am Naked to the Skin, Mercury. 'Tis very well, Now Enter in. What great Fool's this? (Fat as an Ostler.) Damasias. I am Damasias the Wrastler. Mercury. I thought so, you Iv'e often seen. Damasias. True, therefore Naked, let me in. Mercury. You are not Naked Understood, When Cloath'd with all this Flesh, and Blood: Therefore pray Strip; nay, you must do't, And Cast away your Crowns to Boot; For else your Waight will Sink the Boat. Damasias, See, I Obey, and am Industrious, To make my Slender Ghost Illustrious! See an Elegy on Prince Rupert. Mercury. So, now come in, for thou'rt, as Fit, As any ever Enter'd yet: You Crato, throw away your Riches, You that Wore Coats, instead of Breeches; And bring not here your Poetrie, Your Titles, nor your Pedigree. Your Statues neither, which for Mony The City did bestow upon you: And speak not of your Tomb, for that From the Remembrance gathers weight. Crato. Well I will do't, for who that lives, But needs must go, when th'Devil drives. Mercury. Bless me! I think the man is mad, What carry Trophies now you'r dead? Crato. Who for this Honour wou'd not strive, When 'twas a Cities Donative. Mercury. Come leave your Arms t'your living Race, For Hell's a very civil Place: What shade is that? who does behave Himself so well and looks so Grave? Who knits his brows, in such strange fashion, And is so fill'd with Contemplation; And wears so very long a Beard, (Enough to make a Horse afear'd.) Menippus. He is, Mercury, a Philosopher, Who in one hand two Eggs can toss over: A Jugler, Mountebank or Zainye, Who can be ev'ry thing to any: Strip him and you shall ten to one, Find Pretty things beneath his Gown. Mercury. Come, lay aside your Gown and Dress, And let's behold your Nakedness. O Jupiter! What Ignorance, Intricate Notions, Arrogance, Vain-Glory, Trifles, and Contention, (With many more too long to mention) Did this proud Fellow car' about him (That he'l be nothing sure without 'em:) Pleasures and Gold too, (by the bye,) With Wantoness and Luxury; All this I know, tho you'd it hide; Cast off your Lying too, and Pride; Your fond Conceit, that you are blest With Gifts far better than the best; For if you enter burden'd so, A first Rate Ship won't carry you. Philosopher. Since you will have it so, 'tis done, Menippus. Pull off his Beard which is so long, There's no enduring't, 'tis so strong: And does in filth so much abound, I do believe it weighs a pound. Philosopher. But who shall cut it Mercury? Mercury. Menippus, he'll do't Cleverly: Here, take the Axe with which the Boat We mend, but have a care of's Throat; And Chop it off, 'twill save a Groat. Menippus. Lend me the Saw: for that will do, And't's more Ridiculous o'th' two. Mercury. No, do't with Axe now if you can: Menippus. So, now you look like any man; Now this Damn'd Plaguey stink is gon: But shall I leave his Eye-brows on? Mercury. O Yes, for those he us'd when he, Did strive to look most Piously: What, dost thou cry? (O foolish Man) Afraid of Death! Come enter than. Menippus. He still hath one thing strong I see. Mercury. What is't? Menippus. Confounded Flattery. Philosopher. Do you Menippus than lay by Your Boldness, Joques, and Liberty. Mercury. By no means; keep them still, for they Being light, will help us in our way: And you too Pleader, pray lay by Your Similitudes and Oratory; Your Barbarisms, and other Trade, Which you Damn'd Rhetoricians made. Rhetorician. 'Tis done.— Mercury. 'Tis well, now set from shore, Pull up the Anchor, Ply the Oar; Haul in the Ladder, spread the Sayle: Now for a brisk and nimble Gale. Look to the Stern there, you can tell Charon best how; Hey! Hey! for Hell. Why howle ye Fools? What, are ye afear'd, Sure thou cry'st, 'cause thou'st lost thy Beard. Philosopher. No, 'tis (tho ye on me retort all) Because I thought the Soul Immortal. Menippus. He lies, he does not weep for that; Mercury. Prithee Menippus than for what? Menippus. Because he can't be invited more, To Costly Suppers as before; Nor muffled up steal forth by Night, To please his Beastly Appetite; When he's not able for to do, What Nature calls Mankind unto; Yet he next Morn does Wisdom Preach, And Virtue does pretend to Teach: And takes mens Money too, to do't; These are the things that grieve the Sot. Philosopher. Art thou not troubled, being dead? Menippus. Thou art a silly Loggerhead To think so, when I made a Venture, And came my self, 'fore I was sent for. But heark from Earth, I hear a Noise! Mercury. 'Tis a Company of Men and Boyes; Who are met together to be Merry, Since Lampichus came into th'Wherry: The Women Maull his Wifes poor bones, VVhile at his Children Boys throw Stones: Others in Sycyconia Praise, And him Diophantus gives the Bayes; For the Oration he did bawl, At our Friend Crato's Funeral: Damasias's Mother too i'th' Fashion, VVith other Fools makes Lamentation: But no body Menippus cries, To Celebrate thy Obsequies. Menippus. Not so, for when they bury me, You'l hear the Doggs bark Dolefully: The Crows shall beat their VVings, and all To Solemnize my Funeral. Mercury. Thou'rt Valiant to a Miracle; So, now we are arriv'd at Hell: Go all to th'Court of Justice straight, VVhile I and Charon get more Fraight. Menippus. Farewel Mercury, we will on; And see what here is to be done. VVhat will become of you my Friends? You must b'Arraign'd; besides the Fiends Have strange Prodigious Methods here To Punish; some with Wheels they Tear, Some they Expose in Frozen Parts, Where Vultures prey upon their Hearts. Others do Maull their flesh and bones, By Rolling weighty Craggy Stones; While others are with Serpents Lasht, And into boyling Caldrons dasht. Here all your thoughts will open'd be That ev'ry one Accordingly, May have his Just reward of Misery. A Dialogue between Pluto and Terpsion. Ter. It is Unreasonable Pluto, That I shou'd Dye so Youthful (you know;) And that at Ninety-Odd, Thucritus Shou'd still remain Alive, to Spite us. Plu. You are mistan'e; tis very Just, That such base men shou'd still dye first: For those alone deserve to Live, Who Wish their Friends, and Kine may Thrive; And those do Merit well the Grave, Who Wish Folks Dead, their Wealth to have. Ter. But is't not Just, the Old shou'd Dye, And leave their Gold to such as I? Plu. Thou mak'st new Laws, when thou dost Wish, That those who can't Enjoy the Flesh, Shou'd be no more: Besides, 'tis Vain, For Heav'n (certainly) did Ordain, More Stranger Things than this shou'd be: (And that from all Eternity.) Ter. 'Tis their Decrees that I too Blame; Besides, methinks it is a Shame, That Old Men shou'd remain so long, And Death take off, the Brisk, and Young: As for Example (mind I pray) That an Old Fellow doting Grey, With Palsy, Pox, and Gout, at once, A sniveling fribbling Bag of Bones, Who makes no other Use of's Senses, Than pestring People with Pretences; A Walking Church-yard, Living Grave, A Frigid, Senseless, Testy Knave, Shou'd Live, when such Young Men as I, Who Brisk, and Vigorous are, must Dye. 'Tis just like one who's made by Force A Slave, for better, and for worse, Where th'Gray Mare, proves the better Horse. Or other wayes t'Express the Thing, Like Rivers, mounting to their Spring; But at the last, I think 'tis Vain, Since we know nothing, to Complain. Plu. Why do you than so much admire, And what is other men's, desire? Why so much Love do you pretend, To Rich Old Men? (and call 'em Friend;) Wheadle them too, to call you Son, As if your business then were done; To make us Laugh at you, when they, Attend you to your House of Clay. For it is Pleasant (Troth) to us, To see men Brisk and Vigorous, Carress Old Age, and be Enamour'd, VVith what's so Fulsome and Ill-favour'd; Yet this ye only do when They're Or Childless, or without an Heir; Then you in hopes to get their Gold, Direct your Courtship to the Old. Gola! which can make the Aged Young, The Cripple VValk, the Feeble Strong, The Ugly Handsome, Swarthy Fair, And teach the Cunning Knave to Swear; May well perswade you, for I see, All Humane-kind so Worship me, That Gold's their only Deity. But these Old Men oft Countermine, And pay you off in your own Coyn; For if it happen to their Lot, That many Children they have Got; They will pretend 'fore you t'abuse 'em, And Beat, and Thump, and basely Use 'em, That they may be by you presented, And your Vain hopes in part contented: Yet when Grim Death, on them does call, They'l Settle on their Children All, As Nature at the First design'd it; (I wish that all the VVorld wou'd mind it,) And not make all this Factious'Do, But give to ev'ry one their Due; VVhile you may easily count your Gains, And take your Labour for your Pains. Ter. And this it is spoyls my Content, For I a VVorld of Mony spent, In Courting this Old Hypocrite, This Fumbling Limberham'd Thucrite: For ev'ry day he had the hick up, VVhich made me think, he straight wou'd kick up; And caus'd me to present him double, That I my Rivalls all might bubble; Which I believe (I Vow and Swear) Was the Cause of my coming here: For I in nothing cou'd delight, Nor did I sleep by Day or Night. And tho of Gloves I made a Cap well, I cou'd not steal a Nap i'th' Chappel; At which this Cursed Dogg did flout, VVhen the Old Women lay'd me out. Plu. Old Heart of Oak! Hold up thy Head, And see 'em all as door-nail Dead. Ter. I wish Chariades might dye, Before him too, as well as I. Plu. Melanthus, Phido, all shall come, I have already read their Doom. Ter. That pleases me to th'Heart, and Liver. Happy Thucritus! Live for Ever. A Dialogue between Notus and Zephyrus. Notus. D'b'uy! Friend Zephyrus, I have been, Where I more rarer Sights have seen, Than e'er I saw before, (I vow) Tell me dear Zeph. saw'st thou 'em too? Zeph. Not I in troth, I kept my Station, And Laboring was in my Vocation, Toward the Indies I was blowing And only saw what there was doing. The Bantamer I saw, (for shapes) As Comely as a Jackanapes, (Tho some large Monkeys, I suppose, I've seen more handsome 'bout the Nose:) Some other Beasts too I saw there, But nothing else I vow and swear. Notus. Well, well! say what you will 'tis vain, The like can ne'er be seen again: Do'st know King Agenor my Lad? Zeph. The beautiful Europa's Dad? Notus. You are i'th' Right, 'tis she I mean To speak of now, (a pretty Quean) And you know Jove that Rampant Woer, Had long since a Months mind unto her: So far you're right, but what came on't, I'm sure your'e wholly Ignorant: Yet I will tell thee, therefore put-on Grave Looks, while I the Tale unbutton: She be'ng one morn' on the Sea shore With her Play-fellows (ten or more) At Hide-and-seek, and Prison-bace, Hot-cockles, Leap-frogg, and Clap-A— Jove came i'th' form of Milk-white-Bull, To VVheedle and Kidnap the Trull; Leaping and Cap'ring to delight her, And tame as any Lamb, t'envite her: VVhich she observing, (straight the Gull) Resolves to back, and Ride the Bull: So on she flings her self a-stride, No sooner pleas'd, but up and Ride; VVhen straight the Bull with furious hast Into the Brinish Ocean dasht; VVhile she with hand on's Horn did sit, And lookt as if she'd been besh— The Wind blew so, she had no fence, Nor Vaile to hide her Twenty-Pence: VVith head behind she thus sate bawling, And on her scar'd Companions calling. Zeph. Is this the Exc'lent Show (you Lout) VVhich you have made such stir about? Jove turn'd a Bull, and on his back To Spirit away a silly Crack. Notus. You'll like it well I do not doubt, VVhen you have heard the Story out; For straight the Winds left off their Clutter, The Foaming Ocean ceas'd to sputter; So gen'ral was the Quiet Dress, Nature's whole self seem'd Motionless; A Thousand Cupids flutter'd round, (To grace the show,) with Roses Crown'd: Some cut the Air with nimble Motion, VVhile others Caper'd on the Ocean: So brisk and Airy still they trod, There was not one of 'em wet-shod: And what was strange, not one o'th' Host faild, Tho not a Boy of 'em was Frost-Nail'd: Some carry'd Links, (altho'twas day) Others sung Ballads all the way; As Colly-Cow, and th'Ladies fall, VVith Hey Boyes up go we (and all.) Next came a Troop of Gods o'th' Sea, With Oyster-shells, Arm'd Capapea: The Nymphs too scorn'd to be behind, When such a business was i'th' Wind. These mixt together as they went, And made a motly Regiment. Each one upon a Fish did Ride, Or God, or Goddess, all a-stride; And 'twas a pretty sight to see, Each Nereid naked to the Knee: But that which set me all on fire, Was when I saw—a litter higher: The Tritons too did there resort, And play'd their tricks to make 'em sport: Neptune and Amphitrite were there, T'attend their Brother Jupiter, To give the Bride, as 'tis the Fashion On such Occasions, in that Nation: But one thing I forgot to tell, Venus was there too, in her Shell, By Tritons drawn, enough to scare one, Scattering of Flowers, on the Fair one: Briskly in faith she lay'd about her, The sight had nothing been without her. Thus Jove Travel'd with his sweet one, From off Phenicia to Crete on: When straight he chang'd his Beastly shapes, And lookt a God; at which the Trapes To see him thus so finely 'quipt, Lookt just as if she had been Whipt: Then to the private Cave Dutean, He lead the silly blushing Quean, And did—You know, you know what I mean. At which the Sea Gods all went home, The Winds too blew, the Sea did Roam; All that did thither then resort, Withdrew and left 'em to their Sport. Zeph. I envy thee, (by this good Light) The Pleasure of this Pleasant Sight, Which but related gives Delight. FINIS.</field>
