      <field name="fulltext">SIR DEGREUAUNTELINCOLN MS Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. [I] Jhesu, Lorde in Trynite, Graunte Ã¾am heuen for to see Ãat luffes gamen and glee And gestis to fede. Whare folkes sittis in fere, Ãare solde men herken and here Of beryns Ã¾at by-fore were Ãat lyffed in arethede. I will ?ow telle of a knyghte: Sir Degreuante for-sothe he highte, He was hardy and wyghte And doghty in dede; Was neuer knyghte Ã¾at he fande In France ne in Scotlande Mighte sitt a strake of his hande One his styff stede. [II] With Kyng Arthure, I wene, And Dame Gaynore Ã¾e quene, He was knawen for kene, Ãis commly knyghte; In Haythynnes and in Spayne, In France and in Bretayne, With Perceuelle and Gawayne, For hardy and wyghte. He was doghety and dere: Euer he drewe hym full nere Whare he of dedis myghte here Be daye or be nyghte; For-thi Ã¾ay named [him] Ã¾at stownde Knyghte of Ã¾e Table Rownde, As it es made in mappamonde, In story full ryghte. [III] He was faire and free, And gretly gaf hym to glee: To cetoyle and to sawtree And gytternyng full gaye; Wele to playe on a rotte, To syng many newe note, And of harpyng, wele I wote, He wane Ã¾e pryse aye. OÃ¾er gammnes he louede mare: Grewhundes for buk and bare, For hert, hynde, and for hare, By dayes and by nyghte; Many fawcouns and faire, Hawkis of nobill ayere, On his perke gun repayre, Sexty, in plyghte. [IV] He walde be vp or daye To hunt and to ryvaye; Gretly gafe hym to playe Ilke a day newe; To here messe or he went Trewely in gud entent, And sythyn buskede to Ã¾e bent Whare gamnes in grewe. To his foreste to founde Both with horne and with hunde; To brynge Ã¾e dere to Ã¾e grounde Was his maste glewe. Certis, wyfe wolde he nane, Wenche ne no lemman, Bot als an ankyre in a stane He lyued here trewe. [V] Ãare was sessid in his hande A hundrethe pondis worthe of londe Of rent wele sittande, And somm-dele more; Many ploughes in Ã¾e maynes, Grete hertes in Ã¾e haynes, Faire bares in Ã¾e playnes, And mekill tame store; Castells with heghe walles, Chambirs with heghe hallis, Stedis stabillede in stallis, Lyarde and sore; Whare he herde any crye, He passede neuer for-by, Ãat he ne was ay redy In landis ay-whare. [VI] He louede almous-dede, Poure folke for to fede With menske and with manhede; Of mete was he fre; Gestis redy for to calle To here mynstralls in haulle, He gafe Ã¾am robis of palle, Bothe golde and fee; In ylke lande whare he come, When he went oghte fra home, Thay hafe haldyn vp his name With mekill melody; In ylk lande whare he went Many man hase he schent; In fightis and in turnament Ãe knyghte was hardy. [VII] There wonnede ane Erle hym by-syde, A grete lorde of mekill pryde, Of brade londis and wyde, And borowes full brade; Hym thoghte desdeyne of Ã¾e knyghte (For he was hardy and wyghte), And thoghte Ã¾e beste how he myghte Ãat doghety degrade. The Erle was steryn and stowte, And rade with a grete rowte, And brake his perkes al abowte, Ãe beste Ã¾at he hade; In Ã¾am he made a sory playe, The fatteste he fellyd aye, Righte by sexty on a daye, Swylke maystris he mad. [VIII] He drew his veuers of fysche, He slewe his fosters, i-wysse; Ãe knyghte wist not of this, Ãe sothe for to saye: He was in Ã¾e Haly Lande Dedis of armes for to fande, Hethyn folke with his hande He fellid in faye. His stewarde hase a lettre sent, A messangere hase it hent, Forthe on his way es he went Als fast als he maye; When he to his lorde come, Ãe lettre sone he hym nome, And sayde, âAlle gose to schome,â And went on his way. [IX] Ãe knyghte no lengare habade, Bot on his waye faste he rade Fra Flaundres vn-to Granade Fast als he myghte; Sone he passede the see, He and his men?e, And come to his contre With-in Ã¾e twelt nyght. To his manere he wente: A faire place was Ã¾er schent, His husbandes Ã¾at gaffe hym rent Heryede in plighte: His tenandrye was alle downe, Ãe beste innes in ylke towne, His nobyll perkes comowne, And fowly by-dyghte. [X] He closed his perkes agayne (Alle his husbandis were fayne), He lent Ã¾am oxen a-gayne Of his awen store; Alsua, Ã¾e sothe for to schewe, He lent Ã¾am aueres to drawe; He thoghte to wyrke by Ã¾e lawe And by no noÃ¾er schore. There-fore a lettre hase he dyghte To Ã¾e Erle of gret myghte, And prayes hym to do hym ryghte Or telle hym whare-fore; With a sqwyere he it sent, Of ten powndis worthe of rent, Forthe on his way es he went To wiet his ansuare. [XI] The sqwyere wold noghte habyd, Bot forthe faste gun he ryde Vn-to Ã¾e palesse of pryde Ãare Ã¾e Erle wonnde; Sone so he of hym had syghte (Sir Sere of Cypirs he highte, Was buskede with many knyghte In Ã¾e foreste to hunte; He was steryn and stowte With many knyghtes hym abowte), The sqwyere thoght gret dowte To byde his firste brount; There-fore wold he noghte lett; Sone with hym als he mett, Euen to hym was he sett With his horse front. [XII] The sqwyare wold noght lighte, Bot haylsede Ã¾e Erle appon highte, And sythyn baron and knyghte With wordis full wysse; He had Ã¾e letter by Ã¾e noke, To Ã¾e Erle he it tuke, The Erle gan Ã¾er-one luke, And saide, âArt Ã¾ou wysse?â He saide to Ã¾e sqwyere: âNe ware Ã¾ou a messengere, Ãou solde by righte here Vndir Ã¾e wode-rysse; I will for Ã¾i lordis tene Hunt in his woddis grene, Breke his perrkes alle by-dene, Ãat proudeste es of pryse.â [XIII] The sqwyare ansuerde full sone: âSir, Ã¾at es euyll done, Thou hase lefte hym full fune, In hert es nott to hyde; Here my gloue with hym to fighte, Be he sqwyare or knyghte, Ãat saise Ã¾at this es righte, What-so-euer be-tyde; Sir, if Ã¾at it be thi will, Thynk Ã¾at Ã¾ou hase done ill; I rede Ã¾ou mende it with skill, For wathes walkes wyde.â The Erle ansuerde, âI-wys, I cownt hym noghte at a cresse, I will noghte mend my mysse For all his grete pryde.â [XIV] Sone Ã¾e Erle wexe wrathe And sware many grete athe, He solde his message be lathe Bot he a-waye went. He tuk his leue with-owten nay, And went forthe on his waye Als faste als he maye Ouer the brade bent. He come hame at Ã¾e nonne; His lorde askede hym sone And he talde hym onone What mendis he hym sent. Lines 221â224 have been culled from Cambridge ms. Ff. I. 6 as they are missing from the Lincoln ms. âSir, and he may as he ment, His game woll he never stent; Thy-self, and he may the hent, I tell the for y-schent.â [XV] Than Sir Degreuant hase hight To Hym Ã¾at maste es of myghte: âJhesu, safe me my ryghte, And Mary me spede! I sall gyff God a vowe: It sall noghte be for his prowe; Ãe tane of vs sall it rewe, And I can righte rede.â Now to armes Ã¾ay Ã¾am dighte, Bathe sqwyere and knyghte, And many worthily wyghte, I-wysse vndir wedis; Thare warre armed in hye Tene score full redy, And thre hundrethe archers Ã¾am by Gud at alle nedis. [XVI] Now to foreste Ã¾ay founde, Ãay stont stilly a stownde, Ãay putt vp pavilyons ronde, And lendid Ã¾ere Ã¾at nyghte; The Erle purvayed hym an oste, He come in at a coste With his brage and his boste, With many kant knyght; He vncuppilde hys hundis Till his rachis rebundys; Gromys and grewhundis Ãay heue appon hight; Thus Ã¾e forest Ã¾ay fraye, Ãe hertis bade at a-baye; On a laund Ã¾er Ã¾ay laye Lordis downe lyghte. [XVII] Sexty hertis were slayne And broght forthe on Ã¾e playne By-fore Ã¾e chefe cheftayne Of Ã¾at contre. Ãan spake Ã¾e Erle on Ã¾at launde: âWhare es now Ã¾is geaunte? Why will noghte Sir Degreuant Come rescu his dere? Me thynke his hertys of grese Berys na letters of pese; We will hafe or we sesse; I walde he ware here. Trewly, or he went, He solde Ã¾e gamen repent, Ãe proude lettre Ã¾at he sent With his sqwyere.â [XVIII] Sir Degreuant was Ã¾an sa nere Ãat he Ã¾ose wordis myght here; He said, âAuant banere, And trompis on hight.â His archers Ã¾at ware Ã¾are, Bathe Ã¾e lesse and Ã¾e mare, Als so swythe were Ã¾ay ?are, To schott ware Ã¾ay dighte. Ãare-of Ã¾e Erle was payede, Sone his oste hase he grayede, He was na-thyng affrayede Of Ã¾e fers knyght. Now are Ã¾ay mett in Ã¾e felde Bathe with spere and with schelde; Worthy wapyns Ã¾ay welde, And freschely Ã¾ay fyghte. [XIX] When Ã¾e batells were iunede With speris freschely Ã¾ay funede; Ãare myghte no sydis be soynede Ãat faghte in Ã¾ose feldis; With suerdis bright on Ã¾e bent Brighte maylis hafe Ã¾ay rent, Glayues gleterand Ã¾ay glent On gleterand scheldys. Lines 297â300 have been culled from Cambridge ms. Ff. I. 6 as they are missing from the Lincoln ms. Ãey styken stedus in stour, Knyghtus thorow her armere; Lordus off honor Opon Ã¾e heÃ¾e heldus. Ãay faghte Ã¾an so frekly Ãare wiste nane witterly Wha solde hafe Ã¾e maystry, Bot He Ã¾at alle weldys. [XX] Doghty Sir Degreuant Lays Ã¾e Erle on Ã¾e launde; Thorow japon and jesserant He lamed Ã¾aire knyghttis. Bryghte scheldys ware schede, Many doghety were dede, Brighte maylis wexe rede, So many doghety bledis. Ãus Ã¾ay fighte in Ã¾e frythe, With waa wreke Ã¾ay Ã¾aire wrythe, Ãe kynde knyghtis in Ã¾aire kythe, Wyse vndire wedis: Beryns are borne down, Gomes with gambassowne Lyes on Ã¾e bent so browne, Stekid vndir scheldis. [XXI] Sir Degreuant Ã¾e knyghte Brittyns basenetis brighte; His feris freschely gan fighte And stirred Ã¾am on Ã¾aire stedis. Knyghtis of Ã¾e Erlis house Ãat were haldyn cheualrouse And in batelle bownteuous, Ãay dyede in Ã¾at stownde. Ãe Erle houed and hym by-helde, Bathe with spere and with schilde How Ã¾ay farede in Ã¾e felde, And sone Ã¾ay s[at]t vn-sownde. Ãe beste men Ã¾at he hade He had leuede Ã¾er in wede; With fyfty speris he flede, And wathely was wondide. [XXII] Sir Degreuant with his men Folous faste in Ã¾e fen, Als Ã¾e dere in Ã¾e den To Ã¾e he Ã¾am dyghtis. He bristis bacenettis fele With scharpe axis of stele, Mony knyghte gart he knele, And many worthy wight; Sir Degreuant was full thra, He pertede his batelle in twa, Ãe Erle fled and was full waa, [On] a stede gan he sprynge; He lefte slayne in a slake Ten score in a pakke, Wyde opyn on Ã¾e bake, Lyand in lynge. [XXIII] Sir Degreuant gat a stede Ãat was gud at Ã¾e nede, Many sydis garte he blede [With Ã¾e dynt of his spere]; He schased Ã¾e Erle in a while Mare [Ã¾an] halfendele a myle; Many balde garte he syle [Ãat are did Ã¾am dere]; He come chasande agayne, Alle his men ware full fayne, Fande he neuer ane slayne, Ne Ã¾e werse by a pere.
