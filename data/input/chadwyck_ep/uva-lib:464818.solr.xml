      <field name="fulltext">Despise not this, 'cause in Confinement writ; Prisons improve the gifts of Grace and Wit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For, Before I was aflicted, I went astray: but now have I learned thy Statutes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO The most Reverend Father in God His Grace GILBERT By Divine Providence Lord Arch-bishop OF CANTERBURY, Primate and Metropolitan Of all ENGLAND.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An Alarm to the Drowsie. Permit not sluggish sleep To close your waking eye, Till you with judgement deep, Your dayly actions try. He that his sin as Darling keeps, when he to quiet goes, More desperate is than he that sleeps Amidst his mortal foes. At night lie down, prepar'd to have Thy sleep thy death, thy bed thy grave. To my Muse. Forbear, vain Muse, thy subject is too high; Thy Soveraign rather, is the Deity; The God of all the World, whose dreadful Name Strikes an Amazement in whole Natures frame. God! what a fright the very sound hath made! My Soul into a Ravishment is laid. I must repent my rashness; when that's done, Let us consult how thou shalt journey on. First let thy Meditations, milde and meek, Direct thy Heart to teach thy Tongue to speak; And from those pious thoughts (my Muse) distil Those Fragrants may befit an Angels Quill: Consider, thou dost boldly dare t'aspire To do the duty of an Holy Quire; Nay, of a Quire of Angels blest, who bring Joy to themselves, and Duty to their King. Then since thy Task is great, thy Work sublime, Invoke Apollo to assist thy Rhyme; Call the nine Muses to inspire thy heart, That every one with thee may bear a part: So to preserve your duties from decay, Striving to Love, to Sing, and to Obey. 'Tis not an easie or a common thing, For Peasants to approach an Earthly King; Then how much study is to be acquir'd, When God, the King of kings, must be admir'd? Yet thou, presumptuous Muse, although confin'd, Makest attempts; I hope because thy mind Takes a delight in a Poetick Air, Converting every Poem to a Prayer. The Task is great, too great for grave Divines; Angels and Saints best sing Seraphick lines. First let thy Pen in Helicon be dipt; Soar not too high, because thy Wings are clipt. The Warning. All idle thoughts from hence depart: Let none, but what are pure in heart, Draw neer; and those tun'd with an Air, Supposing ev'ry page a Prayer. On Meditation. In Meditation let Devotion be The Hand-maid to the Hearts Soliloquie. The Eagle casts her eye upon the Sun, So Contemplation doth her courses run, Fixing the minde upon no Object less Than the bright Beams o'th' Sun of Righteousness. Or else unto those Birds (aspiring) rare, The Soul contemplative I may compare, Of whom King David worthily attests, That by the Holy Altar build their Nests: So Meditation's said in holy Story, To build her Nest about the Throne of Glory. This Bee of Paradise all days and hours Sucks Honey from the choicest Garden flowers. By Contemplation I with God can talk; In Mansions of Eternity can walk. Then, O my Soul, what mak'st thou here below Where nought but thorns do spring, and weeds do grow; Where nothing thrives but loose unlawful Tares, Watered with Tears, and nourished with Cares? Then mount, my Soul, from this terrestrial Bubble, This heap of Sin, and wilderness of Trouble: Mount to the Land of Promise, where thy Wings Shall Consorts finde of Angels, and of Kings. Though present Habitation Here is given, Yet let thy Conversation Be in Heaven. The Soul's Soliloquy. Come, Holy Ghost, our Souls inherit With Beams of thy Cœlestial Spirit: Inflame our Hearts, we thee desire, With Sparks from thy Cœlestial Fire. Thou the anoynting Spirit art, Who dost thy Seven-fold gifts impart: Thy holy Unction from above, Is Comfort, Life, and Fire of Love. Enable with perpetual Light The dulness of our blinded Sight: Cherish and cleer our soiled face With the abundance of thy Grace. Keep far our Foes, give Peace at home; Where thou art Guard no ill can come: Teach us to know the Father, Son, And thee of both to be but one. That through the Ages all-along, This may be our endless Song: Praise to the Almighty merit, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Enquiry. Tell me, my Soul, where doth thy passion bend? Doth it on Heaven, or things on earth attend? If worldly Objects do thy Reason guide, Thou mayst desire, but not be satisfi'd. If thou dost Beauty love, it is a shade; But Righteousness doth shine, and never fade. If worldly Wisdom, 'tis but as a blast; But heav'nly Wisdom doth the World outlast. If earthly Riches, they have wings and fly; But heav'nly Gems do last eternally. Estates on earth do as in shipwracks reel; In Heaven's harbour are no thieves to steal. All thou canst compass here, is trifling store; In Heav'n are Crowns laid up for evermore. Would'st thou have Honour, which the World depaints? What Honour can be greater than the Saints? Or is it Pleasure? 'twill thy Soul destroy; The Just shall enter in their Masters joy. But tell me farther, what is't thou wouldst have? Both Heav'n and earth on this side of thy Grave? Away, vain fancies, ye are Vertues moth, Pitty hath the promise of them both. These lustful thoughts lead thee to splendid folly; But if thou wouldst be happy, then be holy. On Dives. See with what splendor Dives sits at mear, With choice of Dainties, courting him to eat. His Habit Purple, and his Linnen fine, As if drest up on purpose here to dine. How the Spectators look, and seem to say, There's too much store provided for one day: How many wretched Souls do beg for Bread, Whilst this same Glutton hath his Table spread With all varieties? And thus they show Their envy: But alas, did they but know, And well consider what his wants are, then They'd pity him, as if the worst of men. His Talent's rich: on earth there's none above it; But he wants Grace and Wisdom to improve it. All his Estate is but a mighty spoil; He hath a Lamp, but that Lamp hath no Oyl. He hath a Soul, but what doth that embrace? Vain worldly Lusts; the opposites to Grace. His House shines gloriously; but when all's done, He hath the Star-light, but he wants the Sun. A Friend to Vice, and Vertue's mortal hater; Having the Creature, but not the Creator. This world's a Torrent of false Joys; the boat Is his vain life, doth on it dayly float. His Silver Anchor is as weak as Sand; Nor can his Gold conduct him safe to Land, But rather sink him to the Misers Cell, There to inhabit where damn'd Spirits dwell. Can he be worth your envy then? forbear, Rather in pity shed a Christian tear. If he be happy, May it be thy will, O Lord, that I be miserable still. Give me thy Grace, although I'm clad in Rags; Let Vice attend the Miser and his Bags. On Lazarus. The wicked Worldling spends his time in laughter, Having his Heaven here, his Hell hereafter. Contrarywise, the good man whilst he's here Lives as in Hell, to sigh, and shed his tear; But when to Heaven he hereafter flies, God wipes away all tears from off his eyes. Though here he suffer scorn, the worlds annoy, Yet He that sows in tears, shall reap in joy. The Rich man hath his good things in this life, Lazarus evil things, slights, scorn, and strife; But meets at last, with what he here doth miss, Eternal joy: it is the poor mans bliss, Whilst Dives lies, as if with Scorpions stung, Wishing for Lazarus to cool his tongue; That Lazarus who whilome lay before The gilded Postern of the rich mans door, Begging some mean remainings of his table. Dives, rapt up in Silks and costly Sable, Glutted with sumptuous food and choice of wine, Hath neither time nor ear for them that pine. The very (kinder) Dogs, in pity, then Licked his Sores, thereby instructing men To Love and Charity. Observe the end; Angels upon the Begger did attend: He dies, and they to Abraham's bosom fly, Leaving him there to all Eternity; Whilst Dives, striving others to excell When here, tormented is in flames of Hell. Thus Worldlings ride in pomp to Hell's hot Nest, And Penitents in Tears swim to their Rest. The Penitents Praise. Lord, now the time returns For weary men to rest, And lay aside those pains and cares Wherewith we are opprest. Or rather change our thoughts To more concerning cares, How to redeem our mis-spent time, With Sighs, and Tears, and Prayers. How to provide for Heav'n, That place of Rest and Peace; Where our full Joys shall never wain, Our Pleasures never cease. Blest be thy love, dear Lord, That taught us this sweet way, Only to love thee, for thy self, And for that love obey. O thou our Souls chief hope, We to thy mercy fly; Wheree're we are thou canst protect, Whate're we need supply. Whether we wake or sleep, Either to thee is done, By night we through our eye-lids peep As if the night were gone. Whether we live or die, Both we submit to thee; In death we live, as well as life, If thine in death we be. Glory to thee, great God, One Co-eternal three; To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Eternal Glory be. Angel and Man. A Dialogue. Ang. Listen, Oh Sinner, I shall make it plain, Mankind is wicked, altogether vain. Nature instructs the Bru ts to bear in mind A friendly consort to each others kind; But Man more monstrous than of bruitish hue, First preys on them, then doth himself undo: Devouring Widows houses, in his way, Pretending Piety, seems oft to pray. Will with himself and sins oft-times be vext, When as his zeal is only a pretext. Their very Prayers do themselves condemn. As Citizens o'th' new Jerusalem. They would appear, whenas their chiefest care Should be to crave a Pardon for their Prayer. Man. What glorious Creature can a tongue rehearse, May be compar'd to Man? the Universe Is subject to him; all things with applause Pay Homage to him, and obey his laws. God did not from the Angels nature frame His own, he took the seed of Abraham. Man hath his faults, which causeth melancholy; Even ye Angels, God doth charge with folly. Ang. Well have ye said, therein we do agree; For we are charg'd with such vain things as ye: We are your Guardians, so to direct; Ye safely sleep, we Watchmen do protect. So great a truth it is, no more but thus, They are well kept that are secur'd by us, And from the Sacred Writ we cleerly know That ev'ry man makes Vanity his show. Preferment, Pleasure, Profit, are the three That do compleat the Worldlings Trinity. He dies a sinner, as when he began At first to live; So vain a thing is man. Man. Well may the Angels feet ne'r step aside, When ye have God to be your glorious Guide. How can ye wander, or how can ye stray, When ye are always in, and with your way? Your Conversations must be void of Strife, When ye have God your Way, your Truth, &amp; Life. Ang. Man was created in no less degree Than the bright Image of the Deity: He above other Creatures well may boast, As he's the Temple of the Holy Ghost; But how hath he that glorious form defac'd, Defi'd his Maker, and himself disgrac'd; Retaining principles his Soul bereaves, Making God's Temple seem a Den of Thieves? How can Ingratitude sound louder than Yours to your God? So vain a thing is man. Man. But if we do repent, and pardon crave, As God can smite, so the same God can save; Then bring us Hallelujahs from your Quier, We'll vie whose notes shall sweetest be, and higher. Both All Glory be to God on High, And to the Holy Trinity: As first it was, is now, and may, When fading time shall want a day. Of Mirth and Mourning. In midst of Mirth there sadness is, And so in Grief there's joy; Whilst wealthy sinners faces smile, Their hearts do feel annoy. Carnal delights they are but vain, And bring vexations too; They sound like musick in a strain, Whose discord ends in rue. Thus to the Sensualist they play, Lest he prove dull and sad; But when the Reckoning comes to pay, It makes him downright mad. So true is that of Solomon, In laughter there is grief; The end of mirth is heaviness, And Hell the false relief. But he that's truly penitent, And doth his Tears impart, They are to Angels straightway sent, Rejoycing his own heart. They are the solace of his Soul; If bitter they appear, His comforts then the sweeter are, The sinner's Pearl's a Tear. His Sighs and Groans, if they are deep, And threaten to destroy, In peace he may lie down and sleep, The fuller is his joy. The beams of Consolation shine Into this house of grief: His Soul in travel is; at last Sweet Peace is his relief. So that I truly may conclude, He that doth mourn for Sin, Doth weep for Joy; a multitude Of Pleasure lies therein. Those Christal Rivers that do flow So neer the Heav'nly King, They their original do owe Unto a Weeping-spring. One rich drop from a solid sigh Pure in a Christal-birth, Is to be priz'd (by far) above Oceans of carnal Mirth. On Ambition. Honour's insatiate, never satisfi'd; Nor is the Beggar innocent from Pride. The Labourer a Yeoman fain would be, The Yeoman would a Gentleman's degree. The Gentleman must worship'd be at Feast, And to that end must be a Squire at least. The swaggering Squire must needs be dub'd a Knight, Then aims at Baron, as his Title-right. The Baron must be Lord, to please his Girl; If that won't do, he must be made an Earl: That done, Ambition bids him still aspier; Marquess in Heraldry is one step higher. The Marquess then casts out his golden Hook With Cash and Craft, till he becomes a Duke. The Duke no arguments can him convince, But that by merit he should be a Prince. When Prince, he elevates his soaring wing, Flies to the Throne of a terrestrial King: Yet there's no rest, so doth Ambition gull us, He must be Cæsar, or he will be Nullus. Cæsar won't make him yet the World's Commander, Wherefore he must be styl'd an Alexander. And Alexander, though the whole World's Rod, Must be ador'd and worshipt as a God. After his many wonders, even then He found himself to be as other men. Base Pride eclipses those of high degree; But before Honour is Humility: Honour that Furnace which doth heat the blood, Making men act things but profusely good. Swelling Ambition makes a man its slave Till Death's sharp Dart doth post him to his grave. But how in play first came this cheating Sin? Adam would be a God, so it came in. Other sins fly from God, and shun the chace, This boldly flies in the Almighty's face. All that the erring Children have to say Is this; It was our Father led the way. Spiritus Sanctus. Come, holy Spirit, come, and breathe Thy spicy Odours on the face Of our dull Region here beneathe, And fill our Souls with thy sweet Grace. Come, and root out the poysonous Weeds That over-run and choak our lives, And in our hearts plant thine own Seeds, Whose quickning power our Spirit revives. First plant the humble Violet there That dwells secure by being low, Then let the Lily next appear, And make us chast, yet fruitful too. But oh, plant all the Vertues, Lord, And let the Metaphors alone; Repeat once more that mighty Word, Thou needst but say, Let it be done. We can, alas, nor be, nor grow, Unless thy powerful mercy please; Thy hand must plant and water too, Thy hand alone must give encrease. Do then what thou alone canst do, Do what to thee so easie is, Conduct us through this World of woe, And place us safe in thine own Bliss. All Glory to the Sacred Three, One Ever living Soveraign Lord, As at the first, still may he be Belov'd and prais'd, fear'd and ador'd. The Christian and a Worldling. A Dialogue. Wor. Is it not pleasant (Christian) to be great? Chr. 'Tis but a moral cheat. Wor. Where lies the cheat, when I receive the gold? Chr. In crying sins untold. Wor. Must I be wretched 'cause I'm growing rich? Chr. Wealth is oft-times a Witch. Wor. Amity with the World I never mist. Chr. That's enmity with Christ. Wor. I cloath the naked, I the hungry feed. Chr. Those are good acts indeed. Wor. My Purse, for Alms, flows like a Conduit-pipe. Chr. 'Cause ye the Widows gripe. Wor. I sear my God, and do my Neighbours love. Chr. That men may well approve. Wor. I relieve those that have in Perils been; Chr. But only to be seen. Wor. This do I do, what is't I should do more? Chr. Give all unto the Poor; Then may thy name be in the Christian-list: And when thou'rt poor, thy treasure is in Christ. On the Tree of Knowledge. In Paradise it was this Tree did grow, Plac'd in the midst, that man might thereby know It was the choicest Plant; but Satan came, And with his wiles beguiled Adam's Dame. Taste, Woman, eat, quoth he, it doth descry Both Good and Evil; eat and never die, Forbear and perish: herein lies the odds, They that shall eat hereof shall be as Gods. Is it not pleasant? were it understood, You'd eat, and say, it is no common Food: It is an Oyntment for your blinded eyes; First taste, then eat, this Fruit will make you wise. Eve, like a silly woman, then began To bite that Bait which Satan cast for man. She having eat, the next thing she must do, Is to perswade her Husband do so too. Adam forsakes his Innocencie, and They each perceiv'd that both did naked stand; Then cloath'd themselves with Fig leaves, to prevent Their present shame, and future punishment. But the great God (whose ever-seeing eye Discern'd their folly) he was straightway nigh. Perceiving that they for immediate ease Sought for their shelter among other trees; But God's loud voice soon pierc'd the tender bough, Only with saying, Adam, where art thou? Adam as conscious that he was betraid, Confest he heard God's voice, and was afraid: He and his Wife, as two poor naked elves, In dire distress, betook to hide themselves. Then saith the Lord, For what cause wast thou hid? What, hast thou eat the fruit which I forbid? Who told thee thou art naked? let me know. Adam reply'd, This Woman caus'd my woe: She whom thou gavest me said it was sweet; She gave me of the tree, and I did eat. The Woman likewise did her plaint prefer, Saying the Serpent 'twas deceived her. Was Eden's Garden barren, was there none That could invite, but this same tree alone? That fruitful Soyl, whose trees with bending curl'd, And justly styl'd her Mistris of the World, 'Twas there choice dainties made a rich encrease, Paradise then was Natures Master-piece. Of all the other trees said God the Lord, Thou maist delight thy self with free accord. By which it follows with divine attest, That there were more, and who knows which was best? This tree like Adam's self might have been hid. Its fruit was eat, because it was forbid. Thus did their disobedience usher in A world of Sorrow, with a world of Sin. Our God in the beginning did create Man for himself, Woman mans helpful mate: 'Twas then the Serpent first contriv'd to scan To make a Woman prove a Wo [to] man. Adam's cast out by order of the Lord, And Cherubs guard the Tree with flaming Sword. On Judas his Treason. What monstrous Devil, or what horrid Hag Bewitcht his mind, with Blood to fill his Bag? What pains he took for an eternal strife, To sell his Master, and the Lord of Life For thirty Pieces, high Ingratitude, Treason ne're wore a guilt could be so rude. He that is covetous doth hug an evil, Bids God farewel, to entertain the Devil; Although his mouth be full of Gold, his fate Is such, he bites at every tempting bait. Base Avarice, the block 'twixt man and bliss, Betraying Judas with a Judas-kiss; A false deluding gloworm to the blind, And greatest canker of the heart and mind: 'Twas that made him betray his righteous Judge, And do his homage to the vilest drudge. A liveless piece of earth, was his request, Made that his God, to shrine it in his Chest; Whose frantick minde no reason could controul, He sells for silver both his King and Soul. Mark the effect of hungring after pelf; Judas repented, then he hang'd himself. Such is the Character of Avarice, 'Tis Vertu's bane, and 'tis the root of Vice. An Adieu to the World. Be gone, false Joys, ye, and the World are frail, My Soul's immortal; ye shall not prevail To cheat me of an everlasting Jewel: For all your Glories are but menstrous fuel. God is Eternal; your bewitching Charms Are meerly vain, more vain than false Alarms. Heaven is my Home, the World is but my Inn, Stufft up with Straw, with Rubbish, Dung, and Sin. Your Gold, your Silver, and your Diamonds are But Dross; Heaven's Blessings are beyond compare. Here ye have Land, erect your Castles high, But there are Mansions for eternity. Your poor deluding Pleasures soon are o're, But there are Pleasures last for evermore. Here Pride and Envy in swift motion move, But there the Angels dayly sing and love. Here live rich Fools that glut themselves to Hell, But there lives none but doth your best excel. God is my Portion, let Earth hallow thee; Mercy and Goodness both shall follow me: And whilst the Worldling doth in Torments cry, Glory attends the Righteous when they die. Heaven's transcendent Joys are firm and true, There lies my Aim; farewel, fond World, adieu. On a Usurer. 'Tis not the Usurer that gives relief, But rather robs the Spittle, plays the thief With priviledge; whilst others do abhor it, He boldly dares to plead a Statute for it. Tell him of Godliness, you talk in vain; For it is Gold, is both his God and gain. Six in the Hundred from the meaner Tribes, Continuation-money, other Bribes Which he extorts, do make his bags swell o'r, And keeps the Borrower continual poor. Grigory Nyslen of him thus reports, He's like a false Physician who exhorts His feaverish Patient take for his relief Cold Water, which doth much augment his grief. So Money lent on Usury, doth seem Relief, but in conclusion proves a Dream; And as cold Water gives some present ease, But the Effect prolongeth the Disease. He follows Debtors, as the Eagles train An Army, preying upon those are slain: And men flock to him, when they seem forlorn, As birds do gather to an heap of Corn; For they desire, and strive their Food to get, 'Till they're entrapt within the Fowler's Net. Idleness is his Darling, Spouse, his Wife; He lives at ease a sedentary life. His Pen's his Plow, and Parchment is his Field, Ink is his Seed, and Time his Crop doth yield. He's so hem'd in where'er he casts his eye, He dayly views Objects of Charity: But study'ng then to feather his own Nest, Minds them of Principal and Interest. To over-reach he bends his utmost strength, And like the Butler's box sweeps all at length. Agis th' Athenian General set fire On all the Books and Bonds, for love or hire He could procure, by those that did adhere To finde them out, as goods of Usurer: On which Agesilaus was wont to say, The Market ne're had fairer Market day. And Aristotle did this sort decry As Harpies, strangers unto Unity. This biting Usurer, or Man-eater, he Is like the Shark that swimmeth in the Sea, Devouring lesser Fish: So Ostrich right, All Metals sute this Monsters appetite. St. Matthew teacheth us in words but few, Do as you would have others do to you: Be kinde to the unthankful and the evil; God's children scorn to imitate the Devil. Nor will this Doctrine reach a Miser's scull, Be merciful, as God is merciful. St. Paul most piously adviseth thus, In conversation be not covetous. Thus Usery, throughout the Holy Writ, Is held a hainous crime, and thought unfit For Christian practice. Wealth could never buy One little moment of Eternity. It was Alphonsus saying, All such gain Makes a Sepulchre for the Soul: In vain Let Usurers God's Tabernacle hope, That give their Conscience such a wretched scope. Charity's kinde, helps to keep all things even, But Usury excludes the Soul from Heaven. Of Poverty. No stony Walls can make a Jayl, Though Iron-bars do it surround; Confinement cannot make him vayl, That with Contentments doth abound. Men are Trees of one spacious Grove: The greatest men do seem the tallest; But Grace makes little Trees improve, Sweet savour lies in those are smallest. A poor man may be Godly-wise, And sin may make a rich man poor: The silent Lamb's the Sacrifice, Whilst Lions proudly live and roar. The Dove, that Bird of Innocence, Before the soaring Eagle's chose, That we may justly learn from thence, Humility to Heaven goes. Lazarus poor, diseased lay In misery, Earth was his Hell; Yet he to Abram found the way, And Dives went in flames to dwell. The rich man's title and his name To learn, men con them o're and o're; But they more glory have, less shame, That study to relieve the Poor. He that at present lives in state, Above the reach of worldly wrong, May in another world relate He wants a drop to cool his tongue. The Poor are pious Usurers; For having lost their earthly leaven, Their God, with Interest, confers Glorious rewards on them in Heaven. Rich men delight to count their Gold, 'Tis pastime for their minde and eye: Content is happiness (in hold) Such pleasure is in Poverty. On Mortality. When a rich Worldling dies, first question is, How Rich he di'd; not, is he gone to Bliss? Many make answer, or in love or hate, Rich, very Rich, he left a good Estate; Not well considering 'tshould be understood Many Estates are greater far than good. Alas, poor man, his eyes are clos'd with sleep, And his Inheritors rejoyce, not weep. He by Oppression heapt up ill-got Wealth, And they carouze it to their Ladies health. Perhaps when living he undid so many, He scarce hath Tear, so much as Sigh from any. The Poor, instead of Prayers (so much the worse) Attend his Corps with Clamours, and a Curse. What fruit hath man in all these things? his breath Is spent, his labour too concludes in death: His Mamon fails him, all his stores so great Will witness 'gainst him at the Judgment-seat. He leaves to others Principal and Use, But that which follows him is the abuse. He casts about to compass his by-ends, Himself to ruine to inrich his friends: So that each bag might make this Motto good, If fixt thereon, This is the price of Blood. Hark then, my Soul, bestow thy fortunes hoard, Upon the Members of thy blessed Lord. Give whilst thou liv'st, 'tis safe to do so; for Thine eye is then thine own executor. The Poor will praise thee in some pious Ditty, And that may help, for Prayer can save a City. On a Wicked man. Lord, what a creature is a wicked man! His life is miserable, though a span: All his Religion is in outward forms; His Dainties, Meat, and Manna, turns to Worms. The Mercies daily that adorn his table Do prove his Poyson, make him miserable. If his Estate be large, it doth annoy, His dangers keeping what he can't enjoy: Or if he doth enjoy, he so doth use it, That the enjoyment is but to abuse it. Luxury leaves him no time to repent, But lulls him to eternal punishment. The pleasures of this world do pass away, But pains and hellish horrours last for aye. Lord help me then thy mercies to improve; He is ingrateful gives not Love for Love. On Patience. The patient man is of a metal made Not hard, but flexible: He's overlaid With heavy burthens, which do try his skill, Making Affections equal to his Will: All which he bears rather than feed a feud, Not out of cowardize, but fortitude. He by his yielding doth his foes condemn; Rides Conqueror both of himself and them. He above Nature is; and so prolongs His Cognizance, that he doth tire his wrongs. To receive injuries that dayly fall, Pronounceth him more than Heroical. He God's best witness is; and when he stands Before the Bar for truth, his word commands: He hears his unjust, and with fate His Innocence dares to expostulate. His Jaylors that attend him to the Sages, Are not his Guard so fitly as his Pages. His earthly Dungeon is an heavenly Vault; Vertu's his crime, and Patience his fault. His Rack or Wheel, are the ascending stayers That reach to Glory, all adorn'd with Prayers. Good Laws are his protection, not his ends; Minds not revenge, but loves both foes and friends. If crosses do afflict, he doth submit, And is content, 'cause Heaven thinks it fit. He turns an evil into good: 'tis he Can make a Vertue of necessitie. An easie enemy, a certain friend, To injuries can bow and condescend. Than others, far more happy, he applies A satisfaction to his miseries. He that can keep his angry spirit down, Is better far than he that takes a Town. Patience is the Prisoner's Walk, Patience is the Dumb man's Talk. Patience is the Lame man's Thighs, Patience is the Blind man's eyes. Patience is the Poor man's Ditty, Patience is the Exiles City. Patience, the Sick man's bed of Down, Patience is the Wise man's Crown. Patience is the Live man's Story, Patience is the Dead man's Glory. When your Troubles do controul, In your Patience keep your Soul. On the Book of Life. Hark, O my Soul, to escape th'infernal Pit, Know it thy name i'th' book of Life be writ: And for a certainty the same to finde, Read o'r thy Conscience, and peruse thy minde. Think not of Heavens Roll to have a view; Examine thine own Heart, 'twill tell thee true: For in the Conscience of a Saint doth lie An Holy Record of Eternitie. If in thy Conscience thou hast writ God's Word, Be sure the Book of Life doth thee record. When at the day of Judgment God shall look Into his Register, and when the Book Of Conscience lieth open, then indeed The Saint and Sinner both may trembling read. Wherefore, my Soul, so govern hand and pen; Write now, as not to fear to read it then. On Acts 26. 28. Almost a Christian. Learning well manag'd make the Graces glad; But if abus'd, the learned man grows mad, And makes his Learning, as an Hand-maid, sit To wait on the profa'ness of his Wit: But Piety and Parts when they agree, Learning then makes an heavenly harmony. So did St. Paul's, that pious Prisoner; for He was at once a Slave and Orator: Witness his pithy, and his quaint responds To King Agrippa; King, except these Bonds I wish not only thou, but all hereby, Were both almost, and wholly such as I; Not half a Christian, but to bear those Arms Of Faith that may repel the Devil's charms. An altogether Christian's not deprav'd; Almost a Christian shall almost be sav'd. Of Presumption. If thou'rt a disputant, or proudly wise, If ignorant, yet seemingly precise, Beware of being busie with God's Word, To dive into the Secrets of the Lord. His Closet is his own, and wo to they Shall pick the lock, when God doth keep the key. Then be not over-busie; he that will Be sifting every Cloud to try his skill, For his presumption he may have the luck, For daring boldly, to be Thunder-struck. He that will be familiarly bold With Heavens mysteries, them to unsold, May with his judgment overwhelmed be, As Adam was with his unhappy Tree. The Beth Lemites must pry into the Ark; God's Judgment was serene, though theirs was dark. For their presumption this became their gain, They by the Lord had Fifty thousand slain. Then hover not about this flame which brings Soul-fatal falls, by scorching of its wings: I will improve by what we have reveal'd, Not strive to know what God would have conceal'd. Lord, to preserve me from the Devil's gins, Keep back thy servant from presumptuous sins. On Death. Since nothing is so certain as our death, And nothing more uncertain than when breath Expires, we ought each minute to prepare: Death sends no Summons, but comes unaware. The grand decry is past; dispute not why All men have sinned, and all men must die. Man's days are numbred, he can finde no aid; 'Tis God hath man upon the balance laid, And found him wanting. God's all-searching eye Hath thus determin'd, men are Vanity. Corruption is man's father, and the Worms His sisters, they have their corrupt conforms. The Grave it is his Bed, the Sheet his Shrine, The Earth his Cover, Grass his Carpet fine. At last Death comes, and he concludes the Theam, Finds man asleep, and darts him in his Dream. Such is our sluggish life, a shadow, frail, A bubble, vapour, and a trifling tale: So vain a story, that when we grow old We spend our days before the tale is told. The World's of contraries a vast compound, Nothing within it solid is, or sound. Four Elements in opposition move Each to the other. The degrees of Love Cannot be found in a confused heap; 'Tis Heaven doth that holy Order keep. Death gives our earthly bodies a new cast, Refines us, that we may prove cleer at last. What is corrupt, within the grave must lie, Till Mortal puts on Immortality. No mans corruption can be laid aside, Until his body in the Earth abide. He chiefly 'tis that is afeard to die, Hath little hope of an Eternity. The time we have to live, it is but small, Less than a point that's Geometrical. Our common Enemy doth promise fair This world, to cheat us of a world more rare. Our pleasures do deceitfully entangle, Smiling ev'n then, when they intend to strangle. The world is kindest when it most doth frown, And honours lift us up to cast us down. The Christian then should ready be to cry, When God shall call, Behold, Lord, here am I. For they of their Salvation never mist, Have been partakers of the death of Christ. God on the Righteous alway hath an eye; His ear is ever open to their cry: And he that doth a righteous man regard, He shall receive a righteous man's reward. Be truly zealous, shew no vain pretext, But live each hour as if to die the next. On Conscience. The Conscience is a Function of the Minde, A Guide to Straglers, to the Lame, and Blinde. Over the Will the Conscience sits commanding, And is a Guardian to the Understanding: For what the Pen of Nature doth engrave Upon that general Knowledge which we have, Or to our Thoughts, our Minds, or to our Acts, Conscience applies, and summons up our Facts. Paul our Example was of Innocence, Having a Conscience void of all offence Both towards God, and towards men, so cleer, That his own Conscience was his Overseer. Christian, unto thy Conscience have an eye, Lest Conscience doth accuse, for that's a spie. On Memory. Memory is the Store-house of the Soul; The Will's Dictator; Understanding's Scroul. There we hoard up the treasures of our Minde, And fetch them out as we occasion finde. But well it may with filthy Ponds compare, Wherein fish die, but frogs are nourish'd there. So we retain trash that doth sowre and rot, Whilst admirable mercies are forgot. Thus we that should be Temples of God's praise, Are Graves to bury what his love displays. All Injuries most men to Marble trust, But Courtesies are written in the Dust. What's bad they can sufficiently retain, But what is good is idle thought, and vain. Like Nets, our Memories let clear waters go, And nothing catch but sticks and weeds of Wo: Or else like Sieves (so rashly are we born) That do retain the Chaff, let go the Corn. But like an holy Ark the Soul should be, And as the pot of Manna, Memorie. Our faculties herein need no excuse, Preserving holy Truths for holy use. On a Death-bed-Repentance. This Speech, though sad, it did a King survive; I now must die, e're I begin to live. And such is the condition of that man That dies e're his Repentance is began; That wants his weapons, can for none implore; For why? Behold, Death knocketh at his door. What signifie Petitions of a Heart That trembling lies when Death presents his Dart? Unhappy certainly must be their Dooms Have Oyl to seek just when the Bridegroom comes. Death and the Devil do their Souls pursue, And they no refuge have to fly unto. The seven years of Plenty all are gone, And years of Famine are not thought upon. Time that is swift hath took his nimble flight; Travel doth tire, yet we want rest at night: I'll therefore finish every Work I have, So shall I go with Peace unto my Grave. On the Mariner. The Mariner that's drove by Boreas breath, Doth sail within four inches of his death. So of the Soul the saying may be true, That e're it bids its Cabinet adieu, Four inches is the most that it doth keep Betwixt its life and an eternal sleep. If the Ship splits, or by a fire doth shrink, The Ship is swallow'd, and the Sailers sink. So if our earthly Vessels break, the Soul Doth to another Habitation roul, For ever plung'd into a boundless Sea, The bankless Ocean of Eternity. The Soul should therefore careful be, and strive To swim, before it come to sink or dive. On an Israelite. As the Tree falls, so doth it lie; And when Death strikes, all men must die: Only herein the difference is, God gives us misery or bliss. As in the Red Sea, if I go An Israelite, though waters flow, In triumph I shall tell my story, And land rejoycing, full of Glory, While all mine Enemies lie spread Upon the shore, and each one dead: But if Egyptian-like I croud, And be on this side of the Cloud, On this side of the Covenant, And yet run hardned in (for want Of Grace) amongst proud Pharaoh's Troops, The Sea shall open all her Poops: And e're I finde my Journeys length, Justice shall swallow me with strength; An Inundation shall destroy My Soul, and drown my future Joy. O Lord, then by thy powerful might, Make me thine own, an Israelite. On Shame. The age is impudent in which we live; Men seem asham'd to be asham'd of blame; And to their Errours such a licence give, That they delight to glory in their shame. They have a specious Cloak for each offence, And study how to palliate their Vice. The Covetous hath Husbandry's pretence; The Prodigal is free, perhaps at Dice. The Lecher shrouds his sin i'th' mask of Love; The Drunkard to good fellowship pretends; The Cheat doth for his Family improve Ill-gotten goods; each have their private ends. They blush not at the fact, yet will not own The Title; by the which we may conclude The sense of shame, when to perfection grown, Restrains from sins, can hide a multitude. But he that is this apprehension past, Lets loose the Reins of his suborned will, Goes hand in hand with Satan, till at last Madness and Mischief are his joy and skill. The World says to him, Take thy pleasure, swim In Lust and Liquor: Heart, the Minde, and Eye Are lively, merry, careless, and so trim, He doth not care though God's his enemie. Fools shew their folly as it sutes their name, But prudent men will be asham'd of Shame. On the Wilful Impenitent. Tell me, fond Worldling, why dost thou deride A godly Christian? Is't thy natures pride? Dost thou not dayly see his weeping eye Shed Tears to wake thy sleeping Lethargie? See how he trembles at the sight of sin! Whilst thou, lewd actor, longest to begin; And look'st on him as pusillanimous, A Coward, or a Drone. I tell thee, thus Thou'rt rashly valiant, and dost spend thy breath On Toys, whilst he dare boldly look on Death. He's truly noble; and when he appears, Is not appall'd before the King of Fears. Heav'n is his harbour, Grace doth most delight him; Hell's horrours may appear, but not affright him: But as a Conqueror over Death and Hell, Can with his Smiles all their Bravadoes quell; And with a chearful heart this Ditty sing, As if in scorn, O, Death, where is thy sting? Or like a Cherubim that flies on high, Can say, O, Hell, where is thy victory? This is the Valediction of a Saint, Whilst Sinners toyl, and in their labours faint. Where is the Worldling's glory? He can sin, Can vitious be, and he can boast therein: Can silence Conscience, and outface a Crime, And shun a blush to damn his Soul betime. That man a Coward is, and fights by stealth; For if a sickness doth impair his health, He then believes Death doth a summons beat, And his large Spirit sneaks to a retreat. Doth he not tremble when he once hath got A shaking Ague, or a Feaver hot? And when he feels the heavy hand of Fate, He begs for quarter, though it be too late. What heaviness then sits upon his look? Terrour appears, Conscience unfolds its book, Charges him to consider well and read; And just as he begins, Death strikes him dead. A true Repentance cannot be too late; Early Repentance is a blessed state. Thus doth a sinner to Perdition fall, And that which was his Throne, becomes his Thrall. On a Glorious Soul. Whenas the Moon her constant course hath run, And draws to a Conjunction with the Sun, It to the Heavens shines more bright and pure, And towards Earth seemeth the more obscure. So, as the Soul draws neer, as like a Spouse, Shines fair to Christ, is to the World a Blouse. He that is pretious unto God, that man Is by the World esteem'd a Puritan: And he whose Soul in Glory doth inherit, Appears but odious to an earthly Spirit. For he that looks with a Terrestrial sight, Is Lustre-dazled with Cœlestial light. Shine fair to God if thou'lt to Heaven go; Beauty on earth is a beclouded show. On Contentation. Cyneas asking Pyrrhus his intent, What he would do after his hazard spent In many Victories, Pyrrhus did reply, He'd take his ease, and then live merrily. To whom Cyneas, That you might have done Before, were you contented with your own. 'Tis not the largeness of the Cage doth bring Notes to the Bird, instructing him to sing. Moreover, though a Bird hath little eye, Yet he hath wings by which he soars on high, Can see far wider, and abundance better Than may an Ox, although his eye be greater. 'Tis not the great Estate that brings Content, But Piety, the Christian's Ornament. The Righteous having little, no promotion; Yet what he hath, when joyned with Devotion, May feel more comfort, more enjoy God's bounty Than he whose Incomes may command a County. But few can be content with what they have; He that hath hundreds, still for more doth crave: If his Possessions be in Houses, Land, He grasps at more, and with a ready hand Omits no mischief that his Craft can nurse, To fill his Coffer, or enlarge his Purse. The greatest thing in little compass can Be comprehended, is Content in man. And this great Vertue hath its safe abode Only in him that is a Childe of God; Who sees, and to his brethren cries, Content ye, Enough's a feast, and Piety hath plentie. As when a Traveller comes to his Inn, He for a Lodging-room does first begin T'enquire; but if he cannot please his minde, He is content with such as he shall finde, Although perhaps his Room may not delight, Well knowing that it is but for a night: So is it with the Christian Pilgrim; he Can use a large Estate, if it should be God's will to bless him with it, yet his mind To Heaven's pleasure alway is confin'd. A little of the Creatures will asswage Hunger and Thirst in Christian Pilgrimage: For let his Journeying be sweet or rough, He knows his Father's house hath bread enough; Therefore as sweetly feeds, in going home, As Sampson did upon his Honey-comb. Let no man's mind on Earthly things be bent; But Having food and rayment, be content. On the Hypocrite. The Hypocrite of Actors is the worst, His own pretences making him accurst. By so much as he acts the better part, And Janus-like with double face and heart, He can compose his forehead to be grave, Although his heart be then his humours slave. His modest face doth shew the Characters Of Justice and Religion; nor forbears His tongue and gestures so much to proclaim; But heart and hands, they do recant the same. When to the Church he comes, he there salutes One of the Pillars, and on knee confutes The Atheist, worshiping that God, in part, Whose Precepts never could affect his heart. He rises, looks about, and takes his seat; Complains that Charity is not so great As he could wish, or heretofore hath been. Perhaps bestows an Alms; but to be seen, Always sits where he may embrace the look Of all Spectators: And his Table-book, In Sermon-time comes from beneath his coat, As seeming fearful he should loose that Note. Then takes his Bible, hums to rear his voice, And turns to some Quotation with a noise: Then doubles down the leaf, as if the same Were found; and loudly asks the Preacher's name: And that his Zeal may fervently appear, Repeats it, that the standers by may hear. He can command his Tears, reckon up sins With detestation; but when he begins He never thinks, with a true pious wrath, How many darling-sins his bosom hath: Nor Alms, nor Prayers ne're fall, unless he spy, Although at distance, certain witness by; As if he doubted whether God would own Receiving them: and is so wary grown, That lest the World should not discern his worth, His mouth's the Trumpet that doth sound it forth. And when his Bags run o're, bethinks to build An Hospital; and that is straightway fill'd With persons indigent, did aged grow, Poor as when born; for he had made them so. With flesh on Frydays he will not be fed, He more abhors it than his Neighbours bed. Will at the Name of Jesus bow, or nod, At Church; anon at Tavern swear by God When his Step-mother's sick, and seems to creep Towards her Grave, he then brings Tears to weep: When he hath cause to fear she will not die, He forces a rejoycing-sympathie With her best friends. 'Tis hard to rightly paint An Hypocrite. To strangers he's a Saint; A meer pretender to the Poors relief; Private Extortioner; his Neighbours grief; The blot of goodness; scoff in good mens sight; A rotten Stick to trust in dark of night; A Candle temper'd ill, with a large snuff; The Poor man's Plague, and a religious Huff; The Fool's great Idol, and the Wise man's scorn; A choaking Poppy in a field of Corn: Abroad an Angel, free from least of evil; At home none more implacable, a Devil: And when an Angel worse, a guide amiss; But when a Devil, shews but what he is. As the Apostle's Phrase is, many men Are servants of the eyes; for they shall, when They are beheld, act Vertue with a grace, And in their Zeal run with a thorow pace: When they perceive Spectators all are gone, They change their habits, for the Play is done. They curious Searchers are in others acts, Careless Correctors of their own foul facts. They to their Lust and Lewdness are so prone, They think they're safe, because espi'd by none. Thus an ill nature leadeth man to sin, And corrupt custom bids him 'bide therein. When carnal Constitutions get a head, They, like Commanders, do weak mortals lead: But for the Hypocrite, he seems a friend Will promise much, but, not without an end, Nothing perform; but many he hath broke, Receiving substance, but returning smoke. And he whose quality is eminent, More foul's the quality of his intent. Acts that dishonourable are, look great In them, by blood or parts, have Honours seat. The Publican and Sinner have more right To Heaven's Mansions than an Hypocrite. I with Prolixity might spoil my Pen, For he's in verity the scum of men. The worst of damned Souls their portion have With him in hot and horrid scorching Cave. There leave we him and his tormented bone Measuring minutes with deep sighs and groan. On Envy. All lusts reduced are to Three-fold heads, Lust of the eyes, the flesh, and that which leads To as much Vice and a continual Strife, The haughty humour, or the pride of life. But Envy is the chiefest lust of eyes; Seeing another good, with him it vies, Not to be farther good; his envy grew, Seeing good men belov'd and honour'd too. Envy thinks all men made of equal stuff: Why may not envious men be good enough? It for the Innocent defends a Cause To seem a Saint, and to procure applause: But 'tis a Plague within a man's own brest, And a Disease will not admit of Rest. If such a thing as Admiration be, It's heart doth whisper, That belongs to me. It is a furious wind, which to rehearse, Sometimes breaks forth to shake the Universe. A sharp Malignity, most quick of sight; An Ostrich with an eager appetite. Cherish a Dog, and you may make him tame; Lions by gentleness become the same: But man grown envious, if you speak him fair, Yet keep at distance, of his wiles beware: For if he sees you creep, then he proves worse, May smile upon you when his heart doth curse. If the World's frowns do force you to comply, He gluts himself with your adversity; And Beetle-like, as I have heard it sung, When hungry grown, doth eat its fellows dung. Whilst Envy doth obliquely look upon The good of others, all his own is gone: Or at the least takes no delight; the smart Is like a Vulture seeding on the heart. The Basilisk by nature kills all Trees And Shrubs it breatheth on; and when he please Doth scorch and burn all Herbs, and Leaves of Grass Over the which his body chance to pass. So Envy is an Ætna in a man, (Like the Cantharides) if feeding can Encompass as its stomach doth dispose; And often diets on the fairest Rose. It is a Passion doth ones Health deser, And proves at last a man's Self-murtherer. 'Tis Couzen-German to the sin of Pride, And each may well be call'd a Homicide. Wrath kills the foolish man, when in his way The envious man the silly Soul doth slay. The eye, alas, is the unhappy pit That first doth this destructive guest admit: And when it gets a full possession once, It shrinks the Nerves, and rots into the bones: Till with Consumption it doth man environ, Feeding on him as Rust doth seed on Iron. Envy believes its will should be its law: Socrates saith, 'Tis to the Soul a Saw; Grates without mercy when it doth behold Its dross, and sees another shine in gold. Like the poor Fly, to put the Candle out, Doth burn it self with buzzing round about. Or like the Bee, that with a humming flies, Looses his sting, and then at once he dies. Or Viper-like, to make a Paul expire, Leaping on him, is cast into the fire. Envy's a Canker in the Heart and Minde, Spleen to the good; Great Charity is kinde. On Supplication. As in a Ship when sailing from its Port, The Sails are hoised, thereby to exhort Some skilful Mariner to shew his art, Who presently doth to the Rudder start. So every morning when we rise from rest, Our hearts should study for a just Request: For that's the Rudder of our life and age, To guide us through our Earthly Pilgrimage. Heav'n is our home, and God alone; to him Through Rivers of our Tears we ought to swim: For when God's wrath is kindled to a fire, No other water can allay his ire. Christians no better Messengers can send Than Prayers and Tears, Angels on them attend. Moses by Prayer, that prevailing Word, Harm'd Amalik much more than Israel's Sword. Th'Apostle Paul this golden Rule hath laid, Let supplications for all men be made: In which great duty let this be observ'd, First a due preparation, not with carv'd Or starch'd Expressions made by Wit and Art; God doth desire truth in the inward part. Consider, thou the Supplicant art dust, A vile and sinful man, a heap of Lust. The Lord, to whom thou dost thy Prayers apply, Is Holy, Wise, of Sacred Majesty. Let Meditation guide thee in thy way, Lest thy frail minde distracted be, and stray. Pray for things lawful, don't that bound exceed; For God, before ye ask, knows what ye need: But silence in the Soul he doth abhor; Mercies are small, if not worth asking for. Pray not for Mercies as thy fancy drives, As little Children do for Toys and Knives, Who when they have them know not how they're us'd; Mercies are better wanted than abus'd. Make Supplications in the Name of Christ; Thou mayst be good, yet shew not merits list. Examine well thine heart, keep Faith therein, For whatsoever's not of faith, is sin. Be constant, that thou mayst abide the touch; For fervent righteous prayer availeth much. Birds without motion cannot fly i'th' Air, Nor without work can we persist in Prayer. Pray in Humility, and nothing fear; The poor man cryed, and the Lord did hear. In Supplications be importunate; Pray perseveringly; and in that state So guide thy thoughts, and so thy heart prepare, As if thy life were one continual Prayer. All our Iniquities we must forbear; In vain we pray, when God shall stop his ear. On Luxury. Seneca speaks of some (of tender years Suppos'd) that hang'd their Lordships at their ears. And in our time, Gallants, to their disgrace, Convert their Lands to Feathers and to Lace; Wasting their Rents to purchase Silks and Stuffs, Mortgaging Mannours to procure them Muffs. This they have left, when all things else are gone; Air for their breath, and Earth to tread upon. Apicius in his Kitchin did expend Two millions of Gold; and in the end, Having devour'd so much, begins to think What might remain of his huge mass of Chink: Finding Two hundred thousand crowns, no more, He then concluded he was waxing poor: Too little 'twas his humour to suffice, Wherefore he poyson drinks, and so he dies. Thus our Estates, though large, in vain are spent, When the main thing is wanting; that's Content. The Glutton Philoxenus did inveigh Against Dame Nature, and for what, I pray? It was because his neck was made so short, His eating was no recreating sport, But wisht his neck were like a Cranes for length, Better to relish his sweet morsels strength. To the Insatiate, Water, Land, nor Air, Sufficient is to keep him from despair. How many golden Mines at stake must lie, To bear the charge of Prodigality? Of Henry Duke of Guise it hath been said, Usury was his pleasure and his trade: For when his large Estate to ashes burn'd, At last it all to Obligations turn'd. But he that spendeth all to please his friend, Perhaps may visit him, but want i'th'end. But the three B's, Back, Belly, Building, have To fair Estates each one become a Graze. Luxurious men this for themselves may say, Their hands are their Executors, and they Before old age approach to make their years Many, their eyes are their own Overseers. Much of their Patrimonies they expend Upon their Guts, the rest to Harlots lend; Who usually do leave him full as bare As Crows do leave a Carcass; and 'tis rare When Riot doth into man's Senses steal, But certain Ruine follows at the heel. Beggery doth on Luxury attend, When the poor Spendthrift hath no other friend; And doth at last so despicable grow, He is beneath the thought of Friend or Foe. The Drunkard and the Glutton, e're he die, Shall know the want of Superfluitie. On Enmity. Pliny affirmeth, that the Serpents Brood Cannot be reconcil'd to man: nor wou'd The learn'd Bodinus this Relation tell, Did not his own experience know it well. A capital Antipathy is spread Between the Woman and the Serpent's head: So that within a multitude of men If but one woman croud i'th' middle, then The Serpent doth his Enmity reveal By finding her, and stings her in the heel: Well verifying what their Maker sed, Th'Serpent should bruise her heel; her seed, his head. Perswasions may o'rcome an Enemy; Irreconcilable is Enmity: It is a mutual Malevolence, That between parties studies for offence. A dire antipathy that doth create The killing Canker of a mortal hate. Magirus saith, Nature makes it appear In divers Creatures, namely Horse and Bear, The Eagle and the Swan, among all Fowl, The lesser sort of Birds oppose the Owl. The Toad and Spider likewise do agree Each one to poyson by antipathy. The stately Lion of couragious stock, Though bold and fierce, is fearful of a Cock. But the most sharp hostility indeed, Is between Satan and the Womans seed. The Dream. Methinks I hear Six voices cry aloud! The first of Dying man's, by sickness bow'd; That of the Damned is the second voice; Thirdly my Soul with an affrighted noise; The fourth is Christ's with sweet inviting chimes; The fifth's the charming voice of Evil times; The sixth a voice that doth the Sense allay, A dreadful Summons to the Judgment-day. The Dying man, methinks, doth make his moan, Breathing out sighs, and with each sigh a groan: Oh, loose no time, call every minute o're, A minute's pretious; man's whole life's no more. Oh that I could make sure of Heaven, for now My days on Earth unto a period grow. The Damned cry and roar: O see the end And sad effects of sin! sorrows attend The wicked man. I now discern my Crime, And feel the punishment of loss of time; And then I hear my Soul expostulate, Oh, thou my body, frail, of wretched state, Why should I play the fool to please thy Lust, When all my Kindnesses are writ in dust? Nay, in ungrateful dust, that doth repay A Pearl, only besmearing it with clay. Thou but a moment art of time; but I Must last for ever, to Eternity. When thou with Rottenness art whelm'd about, Where shall I be? 'Tis fit I should get out Betimes from such an Earthy house as thine, And, as a Star, in Heaven's mansion shine. Angels are my Companions there: dost think, To pleasure thee, I'll to Perdition sink? Is it not better, prethee Mortal tell, To Heaven we go, than thou bear me to Hell? And then methinks sweet Jesus is at hand With invitations thus: Behold, I stand Here at the door, and knock; I weep, I sue Until my head is covered o're with dew: I wait and beg to lead thee to Delight, My locks being filled with the dew of night. My tears, my groans, my crying blood doth knock; Open to me, thou heart, if not a Rock. With patience I beseech, let sin no more A lodging have, and Christ wait at the door. Let not Damnation gull thee with deceit, Whilst thy Salvation doth intreat and wait. Then evil times methinks do thus invite: Oh, now consider, walk as in the light; Let all your Vertues be adorn'd with Rays; Be living Christians, these are dying days: Be growing Christians, lay aside vain Crimes; Walk stedfastly in these back-sliding times. Oh, now, or else thou art for ever gone, Leave Devil, World, and Flesh, make Christ thine own. Then the Archangels voice at last I hear, Summoning all the Dead forthwith appear Before the Judgment-seat, crying, Arise, Come forth, ye blessed Saints, open your eyes; With God and Angels each one take his place, To judge the World, and try the sinners Case: Arise, ye cursed naked Souls, and take Your standing before God and Angels; quake At the Tribunal great, from whence shall come Your fearful, final, and your fatal Doom. Lord, the first voices let me hear with fear, That the last voice I may not fear to hear. On Beauty. Have you not heard o'th' bloody Siege of Troy? Of Hellens beauty how it did destroy? The lustre of her Beauty did decay, And she was but a glorious heap of Clay. Or have you read of Jacob, how he serv'd Full fourteen years for Rachel, never swerv'd From his affections? She, his hearts delight, Was amiable and lovely in his sight. Thus we adore those whom we think excel In Beauty, though a painted Jezebel. If these deserve so much, then what doth he That made these Beauties? he whose Majestie Is altogether lovely, doth surpass The glories of an indigested Mass. The Beauty of the whole Creation is As dross to him; for the Creation's his. Be not discourag'd, oh my Soul, but place Thy firm affections on thy Saviour's face. Though Enemies may watch for thy defaults, Christ can secure thee from their fierce assaults. Let him be beautiful within thine eye, And thou shalt live, although thou seemst to die. Be not dsheartned, oh my Soul; for though Rules may be strict and Duties hard, yet know They are as Armour 'gainst the worst disaster; Heaven's thy Wages, Christ himself thy Master. Lord, let my heart thy Beauty understand, No difficulty then shall reach my hand. On Knowledge. This precious Jewel, Knowledge, may compare To those the Israelites of old did wear: For if our Knowledge be improv'd but half Of that, like them we but erect a Calf. Their Gold was precious, all that while commodious; But in an Idol cast, it then grew odious. So the pure Wit of man, well understood, Was in the days of Innocencie good; But when corruption seizes on his age, He becomes vicious that before was sage. Or it resembles an untilled field That barren lies, and nothing else doth yield But Brambles, Thorns, unnecessary Weeds, Till Grace manures it with its growing seeds. The best of Minerals their poysons have Until extracted. Flowers sweet and brave, Their fæces do possess, till art and skill, By separation takes away the ill. So the best Wits have folly, until Grace Plucks up its roots and groweth in the place. In things that do spiritually relate, The Understanding when it's tried by weight, Will like Belshazzar much too light be found, Lighter than Vanity or Verbal sound. Then let not wise men glory in their parts, But hoard their Wisdome in unspotted hearts: For 'tis a Jewel of an unknown price, 'Bove that of Rubies, or of mans device: For he that getteth wisdom loves his Soul, Dare oppose dangers, feareth no controul. It excels Folly as a glorious Star, And better is than weapons us'd in War. 'Tis profitable to instruct, direct, Teacheth the Ignorant be circumspect. Wherefore if any one do Wisdom lack, Ask of the Lord, for he will not be slack. It is the gift of God, and he alone Can Wisdom fix within a heart of stone. Why are we dayly by our sins decoy'd? For want of Knowledge people are destroy'd. With Knowledge put on practice: Satan's brood Have Knowledge, but it does more harm thad good. To Apprehensive Knowledge must conjoyn Affective Knowledge: if those two combine, They give a Christian courage. No retreat Is needful when a Saint is arm'd compleat. When as God's holy Spirit takes in hand To teach the Scholar soon doth understand. To a good Soul nothing's of higher prize Than is the knowledge of deep mysteries. Austin of God desir'd no worldly pelf, But only to know God, and know himself. Knowledge and Love must both accord, for why? Knowledge puffs up, but Love doth edifie. Foolish were they that Knowledge did despise Because it puffeth up: Rather than wise, They were resolv'd continue ignorant And humble, Pride and Arrogance to want. Knowledge puffs up, but Grace gives an allay; For Knowledge can command, and can obey: But those were like Democritus, half wise, To shun Uncleanness pluck'd out both his eyes. Though Knowledge nimbly on our Senses dance, It's greatest part's the least of Ignorance: Yet we are apt to think, though can't discern't, That we know all that can by man be learnt. As in the host of Alcibiades All would be Leaders, none Commanders please: And Epicurus spoke but as a youth, Boasting he was the first discover'd Truth; For he in many things exprest his minde Not as a man, but as a Beetle blinde. Aratus the Astrologer did vent His brags, he knew all Stars i'th' Firmament. Laurentius Vella gloried there was none Writ Logick worth the reading, but his own. Nestorius the Heretick could boast, That he alone, on the European coast, Did understand the Scriptures; when he came, The World awakned was with his great name. Well saith th'Apostle, and 'tis truly so, Man knoweth nothing as he ought to know. On Magnanimity. Cæsar spoke proudly when he boldly said, In midst a storm, Pilot, be not afraid; The angry Surges know not what they do; Thou carriest Cæsar and his fortunes too. The Cannibals, as History doth tell, Are for their courage thought invincible; Rather than seem to fear, remissly flie, Or sue for life, they bravely choose to die. In Alexander's last and fatal fight, He shew'd his Courage was his chief delight, By boasting 'twas his glory and his pride, At once the Power of Persia to divide. Mahomet the Persian Sultan overthrown, His Passion was to such a fury grown, He in revenge (perhaps more mad than wise) Caus'd his chief Captains ten to loose their eyes, So to prevent their overthrow agen; And threatned female habits for his men. Lacedemonians were wont to cry, It was a shame for any man to fly In time of danger: but a cursed fate, Lacedemonians should deliberate. And Socrates, Criton's advice did slight, When by him wish'd to make a private flight. Salisbury's noble Earl, whenas he found The Sultans Army had inclos'd him round, And he advis'd to fly, answer'd in scorn, Heavens forbid I should for that be born; Or any of my Father's Blood or Race Should fear a Sarasin for force or face. Much less then should a Christian fear, whose eye Should fix on Christ, who did for Christians die. Bravely resolv'd it was of blessed Paul After Conversion, his aspiring fall, I ready am not only to proclaim, But to be bound, and die for Jesus Name. Who sails with Christ fears neither Rock nor Sand; Christians through storms must reach the promis'd Land. On Ingratitude. Lord, what a danger lately I escap'd! Torrents of Terrours just before me gap'd: Upon the brink I was, yet scaped free; They are well kept, O Lord, are kept by thee. Surely thy meaning only was to fright, As an advice that I might shun a smite. Thus thy great providence doth think it fit To hit the mark sometimes by missing it. Let me not now appear so idly rude, To pay my God with my Ingratitude; And give my thanks to Fortune, as if she Were Governess of my Tranquillity: But if my thanks may make a recompence, I'll pay them to the eye of Providence. Narrow was my escape; be it my charge, That therefore I my thankfulness inlarge, Lest my ingratitude should justly cause, That since this Arrow seemingly did pause, By touching of my hat, but miss'd my head; The next may pierce my heart, and strike me dead. The antient Romans did this Law contrive; Ingrateful ones should be devour'd alive: He that receiv'd, and thankfulness would want, Was cast, whilst living, to the Cormorant. Lycurgus made no Law to punish such, Thinking no wretch could dare to sin so much. On Disturb'd Devotion. This morning, Lord, I visited my friend, But ill came of that good I did intend. Unhappy I, that then should finde the way, When he to his apartment went to pray. If I'm uncapable my self to build, Shall I snatch Tools from him is thorow skill'd? Certainly better far, more pious 'twere And Christian-like, to joyn with him in Prayer. But now how shall I study an amends, That, as before, we may continue friends? Lord, what he wanted, if it be thy will, Be pleas'd to grant, for he's thy servant still. Thou knowst for what he did intend to sue, And my Petition for him's doubly due. That neither he nor I may loosers be, Lord, hear our Saviour both for him and me. On Sin and Sorrow. Our Sin and Sorrow two Companions are; Sin leads us in, and Sorrow feeds the snare. If our short moments merrily are spent, Into eternal mournings we are sent. He that won't weep while he may pardon have, Hereafter may, in vain, for pity crave. One bottle full of Tears thy sins may quell, But a whole Cloud not quench the flames of Hell. Then let the careless sinner laugh and scorn; I'll weep at present, not for ever mourn. Valleys of Tears do shew their cleansing skill, And raise a sinner unto Sions hill: But the fool's heart is in the house of mirth, His Joy's his Sorrow, and his Heaven, Earth. But he whose Cup is fill'd unto the brink With sin, he shall in Seas of Sorrow sink. Wherefore my Sins I'll here in Sorrow steep, And so weep now, as not for ever weep. On Mortality. Lord, what a Shadow is the Life of man? A nothing, less than is a little span. Just as a Bird when as it takes its flight From off the owners hand, is out of sight. Our present time is as a fading flower, A flying minute, or a running hour. The time to come, after the present's fled, Uncertain is, next Sun may see us dead. Lord, in this hour, oh, make me sure of thee, Lest in the next I miss Felicitie. On St. Peter's Enlargement. When the good Angel brought Saint Peter out From Prison, there was neither noise nor shout That should for joy awake the Iron-gate, Yet of its own accord it open'd straight. But see how all things in their duties vary; He chang'd his Prison for the house of Mary Mother of John, yet stood and knock'd at door, Could not get in, with ease got out before: The Iron-gate obedience understood, Yet he found opposition by the Wood. Easie the answer is, There no man was The Gate to open, or to guard the pass; But as in course it usual was before, A Portress was design'd to wait the door. God would not shew his finger where the hand Of man impower'd was to bear command. Lord, should a wooden Obstacle increase, Or be a bar unto our hopes of Peace, An arm of flesh might set a Peter free Without those Miracles are wrought by thee: But shou'dst thou leave us, Lord, do what we can, We cry, Alas! Vain is the help of man. To God alone all glory be ascrib'd: Jaylors extort, but God cannot be brib'd. The Soul's Search. Like weeping Mary, holy sorrow lays Wait for the Lord, and seeks him divers ways: And Saving Faith, like wrestling Jacob, finds Its Saviour out, and firmly to him binds. Like the devoted Spouse, so fervent love Doth dwell with Christ, not thinking to remove, This brings the Soul to Pastures fresh and green, And leads it to the Chamber of the Queen. Hereafter Christ the blessed Soul doth bring To the Cœlestial-chamber of the King: So that to lodge with Christ and view his face, Is the perfection of eternal Grace. Lord, oh my Soul doth love no other he: I sought, have found, and thirst to dwell with thee. On Prosperity. If wicked men in Gold and Silver shine, Should I at their Prosperity repine? When I indeed behold their spreading Bay, And view their Quails, methinks I'm apt to say, They happy are; but 'tis when I forget Their shining-sun doth with a twinkle set: For when into God's Sanctuary I Once place my foot, I easily descry That all the Blossoms of their splendid Glory Are as dull shadows, meerly momentory; The scum of Vanity, a useless froth, Blasted with one breath of Almighty wrath; External Pleasures, on which they rely, Fill up the measures of their misery. Like the deceitful Salute Joab gave To Amasa; so all their great and brave Bespangled Honour mounts them up in Vice, Only to cast them from a precipice: Or like the Mule of Absalom, doth bear Them to the Gallows, and so leaves them there. Like Jaels present in a lordly dish, It seems to pleasure the luxurious wish; But in the end, when sensual Lusts prevail, The dire conclusion shews a fatal nail; And very frankly chalketh out the way For a sad Summons to the Judgment-day. Thus their Prosperity doth first betray With tempting smiles, and in conclusion slay. As a poor Ox in fatning Pasture feeds To day, the next he's singled out, and bleeds. What envy will at Malefactors flie, Because the day is fair wherein they die? Why doth Iniquity in Glory flourish, In Pastures large? it only is to nourish Them for the slaughter. Hear the sum of all; Experience tells it, Pride will have a fall. For Mediocrity bent Agur's art; He knew Prosperity doth swell the heart. On Humility. Nosce teipsum hard is to be learn'd; A mans own faults are not with ease discern'd. The faults of other men are writ in Text, Easie to read, when ours are not annext. The eye that's fixt on Natures choicest shelf, Can all things see, yet not behold it self. Presumptuous Confidence goes bleeding home, When humble Fear triumphantly doth come. Great Alexander would be deifi'd, Confess'd himself a man, his blood espi'd. The humble man, within another minds All things are excellent; but when he finds He doth decline in Vertue, noble Elf, He is the first that shall condemn himself. His eyes are full of his continual want, Sees others worth, and grieves himself is scant. When he hath but a mite of his deserts, Others he magnifies. Thus he imparts His generosity to famous use, Whilst others do repay him with abuse. From pride and malice none is more exempt; Asham'd of honour, values no contempt. Violet-like, he grows low to the ground, That hides its head with leaves; and he is found Like that, with fragrant smells which so bewray That his own Vertues do his Worth betray. In his Discourse he never flies aloft; His words are few, and those few words are soft. Modestly speaking, not self-glorious, Nor peremptory, nor censorious. Because he thinks all other men more wise, Corrects himself by his own modest eyes. When his Devotions do the time beguile, He makes himself a nothing, wretched, vile; Doth no man emulate: if understood, He hates none but himself, because not good. A mite of Comfort doth his wants supply; And none more patient when in misery, Because he knows that his deserts are such, That having sin'd, cannot be plagu'd too much. He a low Valley is, and planted sweet, Where fresh and fragrant Odours often meet; And like the proud mans earth is trampled on, Though full of wealthy Mines; a pretious stone Fit for foundation-work, not plac'd aloof, God's holy Temple built with lowly roof. Camomile-like, and Palm-tree, when deprest, Doth higher rise, wearied to take his rest. Zacheus from the Sycamore came down, And that descension made the Lord his own. 'Tis not the Proud that do in Christ believe, Not Lofty, but the Humble him receive. Fruitfullest Trees do in the Valleys grow, And thrive the better for their being low: When taller Trees an interruption finde, By the strong blast of a contagious winde: Yet the tall Tree hangs down its head, to say, For this God made me, and I do obey. The humble man considers Earth's his Womb, And then remembers Earth must be his Tomb. Unto Humility God's Grace is given, Who with that Grace a Ladder makes to Heaven. On Vice. When on a Journey, and am weary grown, I finde an Inne within some Country-town, And have observ'd, numbers of Guests do come First to the Chamberlain to shew a Room; Perhaps one Chamber doth contain them all, Yet on the Chamberlain doth each man call: One to the Table bids him straight attend, Another doth him to the Window send, A third unto the Chimney must be led, A fourth would be conducted to his bed, A fifth man sends him down for Glass or Cup, And e're he's down, another calls him up. Thus he's distracted with a sudden moyl, Scarce can please all, though tired with his toyl. Such is the sad condition of my Soul; In what a cloud of crosses it doth rowl! By Nature I am born a wretched twin; To sorrow servant, and a slave to sin. Unto the Window I am call'd by Pride, Gluttony next pretends to be my Guide. By Laziness I'm to the Chimney led, By Wantonness I'm finely brought to bed. Ambition calls me up, but I am grown So covetous, more profit calls me down. Vices, I see, themselves do contradict; 'Tis only Vertue that doth Vice convict. Free me, O Lord, from this distracted case: Vertue it self is Vice, unless thou place It in a centre, like it self to shine; A servant unto sin cannot be thine: For In thy service perfect freedom is: Sin is a slavery, a dark abyss. Satan deludes the Soul to acts obscure; But The commandments of the Lord are pure. Vice is at best but a diseased Whore Splendidly painted, making fools adore. On God's presence. Heaven it is, ever to be with God; Without him is in Hell to take abode. You that in Christ no beauty can behold, Nor Heavens glory, dare you be so bold As not to think they all things do excel? Or can you not behold the flames of Hell? If in God's presence you do not delight, Oh, tremble at his absence. If your flight Be at a distance, as if you did doubt him, Consider well, and fear to be without him. Lord, thou my Heaven art, my God, my Guide, My wedded Husband; and my Soul's thy Bride. On Hypocrisie. The Hypocrite, with his deceitful eye, Doth serve the Devil in God's Livery; And therefore to the Lord so well is known, Both Earth and Heaven doth his craft disown. Man sees his Livery and cunning Art, And hateth him; but God doth view his heart, And hates him too. Men see his outward Zeal, For which they do deride him. He, like steel, Grows strong and stubborn, pleas'd with his own case, Though God and Man do both abhor his face: So that he in a Wilderness doth rove, And never doth become a Canaan's Dove. The sum of all his labours doth at last Consume with the Almighty's dreadful blast: And a dire doom, when he at Judgment stands, Who hath required these things at your hands? He that so cunningly did others cheat, Took greatest pains his own Soul to defeat: He steals his own Damnation, and can tell (For he with sweat hath found) the way to Hell. So that the Sinner openly prophane, And Hypocrite, as they together reign On Earth, although in different degrees, They both at last lament their little ease. Only two ways they finde unto their fate, One steals to Hell thorow the Postern-gate, The other keeps the open beaten Road; But both at last in Tophet make abode. Hypocrites habit is Formality; But, Lord, cloath me with thy Sincerity. Perhaps men may not of my state approve; It matters not, so I obtain thy love. Saints here but labour to peruse their story, When they arrive to their eternal Glory. On Pleasures. In all things an immoderated use Breeds a distate; and man, when grown profuse, Doth glut himself with Pleasure: He that's wise Esteems them chiefly for their novelties. The pleasure of the body gives relief No otherwise than adding grief to grief. When Jupiter (as ancient Poets fain) With all his might and art could not attain Two great Antagonists to reconcile, Pleasure and Sorrow, having paus'd a while He took an Adamantine Chain, with that Bound them together, so that then they sat As fixt Companions: They that were unstable But just before, were made inseparable. Affection propagates our Pleasures growth; Vertue's an Antidote against them both. Pleasure is the Adulterate brat of Sense, So very fading, she cannot dispence To last while Artists shall her Picture frame, And therefore Memory preserves her name. All those delights that do the Senses please, Are one days age, an Ephemerides. What excellence may that be said to be, Which the most excellent (as dangers) flee? Time with the Pleasures of this World is spilt, Full of the stain of sin, and sting of guilt. Hannibal his honour lost, and duty, Being entangled with a womans beauty. Antonius his Cleopatra had; Both were most valiant Captains: but the sad Effects of Lust did like a Cloud o'recast All their Atchievements, and their labours blast. Lust is the bane of Kingdoms: done alone, It would more common be than any one Of all those Vices that corrupt the eye; Heathens the first place give to Piety. And Trismegistus this assertion brings, Religion is the ground of publick things. God did not cast man out of Paradise, That man might make another by advice. Be therefore wary, during time and leisure, 'Tis dangerous to take delight in Pleasure: For 'tis a Syren doth deceive us all; It gives us dainties, but they're mix'd with gall. The Pitch and Tar of Sin so close do cleave, That Pleasure waiteth only to deceive. Riches seem pleasant things to banish Care, But are at best but an intangling Snare. Our Meat and Drink, when taken with excess, Breaks forth to Surfeitings and Drunkenness. Silver and Gold seem pleasant things, yet they, Like thieves, from God do steal our hearts away. That man that loveth pleasure shall be poor; But God's right hand hath pleasures evermore. On an Hour-Glass. As I in haste did through a Chamber pass, I had almost destroy'd a Christal Glass. With fear affrighted, I too soon believ'd That I had broke it; thereupon I griev'd. But how much time more pretious than that sand Have I neglected? and with ready hand Pursu'd my folly, being round beset With sins, yet I not thinking of regret. Though that but Christal, I my self condemn, But minde not Time, though every hour's a gem. The thought of breaking that did me affright; The other's minded not, though lost outright. That were but casual, if it had been done; But with consent my pretious Time hath flown. A better Hour-glass may be had for cost, But Time ill-spent is once and ever lost: For toys our griefs can finde a certain leisure, But have no vent for an unvalued treasure. Lord, let that Hour-glass for its service win me, (Not that stands by me, but) shall be within me. Teach me to number so my days, that I, Right soon, my heart to wisdome may apply. Salve for the Sick. Whenas some sharp Disease shall visit me, I fear, with pain, I shall impatient be: For I am Cholerick by nature made, By temper tender, apt to be afraid; And such a stranger unto sickness am, 'Twould prove a Lions conquest o're a Lamb. O whither will my minde with wavering sail, When a Disease shall over me prevail? O whither will my giddy fancy stride, When a Distemper's the unstable Guide? Wilde-fire will sit upon my burning tongue, When with a Feaver every Sense is stung. Wherefore, O Lord, if it disclose my shame, Let it give no dishonour to thy Name. Teach me the Art of Patience whilst I'm well, That when grown sick, that Vertue may excel. In that day let me not assistance lack; Lighten my burthen, or improve my back, In God I'll trust when Life hath spun its length; For In the Lord is everlasting strength. On Perfection. In Humane life there no perfection can Be said to be an attribute of man. Lust and the Senses have a constant Jar; The Flesh and Spirit do maintain a War Against each other: man may make his moan, He perfect is in Imperfection. None but the Lord that Badge of Honour wears; But man may gain it with his Prayers and Tears; Cannot enjoy it here, but he must fly Where it is crowned with Felicity. They are Cœlestial plants or flowers, both Of Paradise, not of Terrestrial growth. The best in this his Pilgrimage doth hault, Like Jacob with one leg, 'tis Natures fault. Though we have many tongues, as Paul, are apt To climb like him, till i'th' third Heaven wrapt; Though we, with Moses, have in Egypt sought For all the Learning the Egyptians taught; Though we (as Ezra did) should understand; Each Article of every Command. Within the Law of God. Though eloquent In Scripture as Apollos, we indent Too far with Sin and Satan, that our care Hath no perfection, but a perfect snare. We are but Scholars here, to use our Arts In pious duties to improve our parts. The clearest Christian hath some soil or spot: Noah with Drinking did himself besot. Peter with Perjury eclips'd his fame: And with Dissimulation Abraham. With loud Contention Paul and Barnabas. The Psalmist truly doth express the case: The sons of men are so profusely prone, None perfect are, nor none good, no not one. The Vertue that a just man hath, doth lie In Pious works, and in Humilitie. The Author to the Hebrews quotes the name Of many Worthies blemish'd in their fame. Gideon an Ephod made, and that let in Idolatry; he Israel made to sin: Had many Wives, to nourish his designe Of Lust, and with those Wives a Concubine. Barak, although a Souldier, waxed faint. Sampson, a strong and a couragious Saint, Defil'd himself with Strumpets. Wretched fate Made Jepthe rash and inconsiderate. David was tainted with two horrid sins, Murther, Adultery, as if two twins Or brethren; both have his great honour checkt. Samuel observ'd his Children with neglect. No Prince or Prophet but his weakness had, Virtues have opposites in things are bad; Yet they were men that did with God accord, And were most highly honour'd by the Lord; Faithful to God, obedient to his Law: That Chrystal perfect is that hath no flaw. Shew me a Garden that's without its weeds, I'll yield man perfect by his words and deeds. Yet let us not upon their errours play; The Righteous man offendeth every day: And if the righteous scarcely can be sav'd, It plainly shews whole Nature is deprav'd. Wouldst thou of a Perfection have thy share, Repent, like them; for now they perfect are. On a Rose-tree. 'Twas in September I observ'd a Tree That then bore Roses; stranger 'twas to me. Others of like kind round about it grew, Yet all were barren, and those not a few. The Gardner kindly did the reason give: In May 'twas closely clipt, that it might thrive, And bud in Autumn. Lord, had I been kept Curb'd in my tender years, whenas I slept Secure from punishment, my life had been Grey in its Youth, and when grown aged, Green. He that intends to win the happy Race, Must learn in tender years to grow in Grace. The Christians Alphabet. An Angel good Satan himself can make; But the Apostles true, bid men beware. Christ had his Paul the drowsie to awake, Daring even Death it self; such was his care. Earnest in zealous works, did sharply tast Fortunes ill will in stripes of cruel measure; Great was his troubles: he did oft forecast Honour for God, in counting Death his treasure. In Prisons frequent, from the sight o'th' Sun; Kill'd oftentimes, and yet he did revive; Lashes five times he had forty save one; Menacing terms did frequently receive. Night and day in the deep, and shipwrack'd thrice; Once was he ston'd, and three times beat with rods; Perils came often; cold he was as Ice; Quips oftner came than did his days by odds. Render he did his thanks to God for all, Such was his holy love and fervent Zeal, Though first he was a persecuting Saul, Undoing such as bless'd the Commonweal. Wreaths crown his head because he was a Tree Xactly good, too pretious for the flames, Yielding such fruit as few have born but he; Zealous for Heaven, where he in Glory reigns, &amp; so his Losses turn'd to be his Gains. On Christ's Death. My God, my God, turn not to night my day; Shall Mans black Crimes be Darts my heart to slay? Must my dear blood on sinful dust be spilt To pay his debt, and wash away his guilt? My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Must I come from a Diadem to Death, Leaving my joys, in sorrow spend my breath? Must I, that am coequal with the Father, Be crucifi'd, that man may comfort gather? My God, my God, &amp;c. I that e're now was cloath'd in state of Glory, Am now in Rags of Flesh to tell my story. I that fill ev'ry place in spight of danger, Yet I, in fear, was cradled in a Manger. My God, my God, &amp;c. To Egypt I compelled was to fly; I am the Life, yet I my self must die. I am the sole Dictator of the Law, Yet must be subject now, and stand in aw. My God, my God, &amp;c. 'Twas I that both the Earth and Heavens made, But working now at Joseph's homely trade. Children of men, I have ye oft exempted, Can binde the Devils, yet must I be tempted. My God, my God, &amp;c. I made the World of Nothing, Man of Dust, Yet I have hungred and have been athirst. I am become Life to the Lunatick; If God can die, Nature may well be sick. My God, my God, &amp;c. Must I, that keep the Keys of Death and Hell, Pay visits now where griefs and terrours dwell? Must Kings be made the subjects of their scorns, And wear, instead of Stars, a Crown of Thorns? My God, my God, &amp;c. My Senses all extreamly are agriev'd, My eyes beholding whom I have reliev'd, Mine ears with hearing lewd blasphemous Taunts, Instead of Hallelujahs sung by Saints. My God, my God, &amp;c. Smelling, I finde my nostrils streight grow full O'th' evil scent of some corrupted skull. My Taste is chang'd with Liquor like my Thrall, Sower and bitter, Vinegar and Gall. My God, my God, &amp;c. My Feeling, with the Spear that pierc'd my side: That man might live, I thus was crucifi'd. At length my Father heard me, bad me die, But nothing fear, for he himself stood by. An Hymn. By St. Ambrose and St. Augustine. Our tongues, O God, thy praise record; We thee confess our Soveraign Lord. To thee, Eternal Father, all Who dwell on Earth, do prostrate fall. To thee the Angels at all hours; To thee the Heavens and heav'nly powers; To thee with voice incessantly The Seraphins and Cherubs cry, Thou Holy, Holy, Holy one Of Sabbath, Lord and God alone: Fill'd is the Earth, the Heavens, the Skie, With glory of thy Majesty. The bless'd Apostles glorious Quire, The Prophets whom thou didst inspire, And all the White-rob'd Martyrs sing Eternal praise to thee their King. The holy Church does loudly sound Thy blessed Name throughout the round Of the whole Earth, confessing thee Father of boundless Majestie. The same is dutifully done To thy sole Venerable Son: And to the Holy Ghost that arms The Soul with consolating Charms. Thou, Christ, hast Kingly Glories won, Thy Father's dear Eternal Son. Thou, man to free from endless pain, A Virgins womb didst not disdain. That death subduing, didst unlock Heav'ns Realms unto thy faithful Flock. On God's right hand thou sit'st as bright As in thy Father's radiant light. Our Judge to come thou art esteem'd; Thy servants therefore help, redeem'd With thy most precious blood, and make Us, with thy Saints, of Bliss partake. Lord, save thy people in distress, Thy Heritage vouchsafe to bless; Rule and exalt them without end. Our dayly blessings thee attend. Thy glorious Name we magnifie From age to age, eternally. This day, sweet Lord, we now are in, Preserve us from committing sin. Have mercy on us, Lord, efface Our sins with thy Cœlestial grace. Let mercy on us, Lord, be seen As in thy self our hopes have been. Lord, I have fix'd my hopes on thee, Then let me ne're confounded be. On Christ's Cross. Can we spell Chris-cross-row, and yet not read That Christ for us was dead? How he himself did humble unto death, Loosing his life to give us breath? But now he shines in the Cœlestial Frame, And hath receiv'd a Name To which all knees shall bow, and tongues shall say, This is the Lord, we must obey. He that doth disregard the Cross of Christ, Of Happiness hath mist; Destruction is his end, his glory shame; But happy he doth love the same. I will not hate the Cross, nor yet adore Any but he it bore. I'll not blaspheme the Cross, because 'twas dy'd With his rich blood was crucifi'd. Rich beyond price; for when that blood was spilt It cleans'd a world of guilt, It bought mankinde: for when Christ's blood was flown, As Lord, he call'd us all his own. Wherefore I will not worship any one But my dear Lord alone. Take up my Cross and bear my Cross I will, I'll love it and embrace it still. But to adore my Cross I will not dare, All knees should that forbear: In reverence to his Name all hearts shall bow With pious Zeal, as mine does now. Christ never wanted crosses, scoffs, and scorns; His ways were strew'd with thorns: Then may we judge by his most sacred birth, He's cross'd, wants crosses here on Earth. The Cross. The Emblem of Humility Express'd in him, did on it die. To it was nail'd the God of Life, Who di'd in Love to end our Strife. God had one Son who had no sin, But all his Sons have crossed bin. The Resurrection. He's risen now, behold, the stone is gone Which late was rolled to inclose the Son. Had the weak Jews so little wit or grace To trust to that, when he fills ev'ry place? Earth is his foot-stool, yet he dwells on high; Holy his Name, himself's Eternity. The Ascention. How nimbly, and with what a quick ascent Heaven was scal'd by the Omnipotent! But one days speedy journey; surely then Sinners are sots, that won't be happy men. An Adoration to the Lord of the Sabbath. Behold, we come, dear Lord, to thee, And bow before thy Throne: We come to offer on our knee Our Vows to thee alone. Whate're we have, whate're we are, Thy bounty freely gave; Thou didst us here in mercy spare, And wilt hereafter save. But oh, can all our store afford No better gifts for thee? Thus we confess thy Riches, Lord, And thus our Poverty. 'Tis not our tongue or knee can pay The mighty Debt we owe; For more we should than we can say, Far lower than we bow. Come then, my Soul, bring all thy powers, And grieve thou hast no more: Bring ev'ry day thy choicest hours, And thy great God adore. But above all, prepare thy heart Whilst now 'tis called day, In humble duty bear thy part To sing, to love, and pray. Glory to thee, Eternal Lord, Thrice blessed three in one; Thy Name at all times be ador'd, Till time it self be done. Of God. He is the Author of the Worlds Creation,/Foundation. The great and mighty Judge of mans Salvation,/Damnation. The glorious Lord, and only God Above,/Of Love. That both to men and Angels is—A God,/A Rod. He did the World create, and by his hand Or word, Foundations laid of Sea and Land; Can save or damn, as he doth best approve; Will be our God, or Rod, as we shall love. Thou that canst hold the Winds within thy fist, Have mercy on us, oh, thou God in Christ. Of Christ. He it is that gives us Peace,/Increase. He to poor Souls cries, I'm your Jesu,/I.E.S.U. He it is that is our Good,/Food. The Saints with him do trust their Treasure,/Pleasure. He it is can end our Life,/Strife. He it is that gives us Breath,/Death. He is to us a Judge and King,/Sting. He is our Peace, Increase; our Jesu, and An Ease to those that wait on his Command. Our Good, our Food; our Treasure, and our Joy; Our Life, to see no Strife shall us annoy. He gives us Breath, can give us Death, as King, And unto death he is become a Sting. He punish can, or help us in our thrall; For Christ is God's, and God is all in all. Wouldst farther know what God is, silly Elf, Go study first to be a God thy self. God is Love. Give praise unto the Lord above; Omit no thanks that thou canst move. Dost thou not know that God is love? In Word and Deed make him thy aim, So shall thy Soul be free from blame. Let his Commandments be in ure; Obedience cannot be a clod: Vs he hath spar'd, and doth endure Ev'n still; such is the love of God. The Remembrance. And now, my Soul, canst thou forget That thy whole life is one long debt Of Love, to him who on the Tree Paid back the flesh he took for thee? Lo, how the streams of pretious blood Flow from five wounds into one flood! With these he washes all thy stains, And buys thy Ease with his own Pains. Tall Tree of Life, we clearly now That doubt of former ages know; It was thy wood should make a Throne Fit for a more than Solomon. Large Throne of Love, royally spread With Purple of too rich a red: Strange costly price! thus to make good Thine own esteem with the Kings blood. Hail, fairest Plant of Paradise, To thee our hopes lift up their eyes. O may aloft thy branches shoot, And fill the Nations with thy fruit. O may all reap from thy increase; The Just more strength, the Sinner peace, While our half-wither'd hearts, and we Engraft our selves, and grow on thee. Live, O for ever live, and reign, Bless'd Lamb, whom thine own love hath slain: And may thy lost Sheep live to be True lovers of thy Cross and thee. Of Death. 1 Cor. ch. 15. v. 55, 56. O, Death, where is thy sting? The sting of death is sin. O Death, forbear, I yet must live: Stay, Death, till God your Warrant give, And then where you see best, this heart Most willing is to feel your Dart. But, Lord, O let thy servants breath Preserv'd be from the sting of Death. Of Grief. The tears come slowly, Lord, my sins remain: O sting my shallow fords, and make them rain Rivers of waters; or, if so thou please, Send daring death my sorrows to decrease. My grief is great, 'tis time to rise or fall; Then cleanse me, Lord, from sin, and ease my thrall, That I may say, O, death, where is thy sting? And tell the world, The sting of death is sin. A Christian and Death. A Dialogue. Chr. Come, valiant Death, and welcome, do thy worst; Shew me the power thou claimst, as being King. Dea. Poor mortal, know, alas, thou art but dust, And I the Sexton that thy Knell must ring. Chr. Away, lean, half-starv'd wretch, go daunt a fool; Think not to fright me with, Thy glass is run. Dea. Thou art my Scholar, therefore come to School; Delays but waste that time which might be gone. Chr. Thou seemst a Student, for thou lookst so poor, That Famine in thy face I plainly read. Dea. Come, silly wretch, you word it must no more; See here's thy Glass, thy Doom, and thou art dead. Chr. Then boldly strike, thou dost the body kill, My Soul shall wait upon its Master's will. Dea. Lie there, proud dust, all flesh is born to die. Chr. This is the Road unto Eternitie. The Altar. A broken A L T A R Lord, to thee I raise, Made of a Heart, to celebrate thy praise: Thou that the onely Workman art, That canst cement a broken heart. For such is mine, O make it thine: Take out the Sin That's hid therein. Though it be Stone, Make it to groan; That so the same May praise thy Name. Melt it, O Lord, I thee desire, With Flames from thy Cœlestial fire; That it may ever speak thy Praise alone, Since thou hast changed into Flesh a Stone. Death, Man, and Grave. A Dialogue. Death. Come down, proud Lust. Man. To what? to Dust? Grav. I that you must, and shall. Man. Thou thing of bones. Grav. That fetcheth groans, Death. From very stones, and all. Man. From Dust I came. Grav. Thou must again. Death. Sin is thy bain and thrall. Man. That's thee: away Death. With mortal Clay: Grav. Why do you stay? you must. Death. Come, leave your groans. Man. To go with bones? Grav. You must go once, poor dust. Death. Nay, do not frown. Man. Away rude Clown. Death. I'll strike thee down, proud lust. Man. Then I submit; forbear your storms Seeing I must return a Guest To my Acquaintance old, the worms, Farewel, fond World, I'll take my rest. Grav. I have a Charm will make you sleep; And all you have you here may trust: For Watchmen, not a few, I keep, The harmless Worms, that are so just. With care they do befriend him That cometh here within this path. Thus man one world of servants hath, And when he on his Death-bed lies, Another doth attend him. Nature's Delight. Hark, my Soul, how every thing Strives to serve our bounteous King. Each a double tribute pays, Sings its part, and then obeys. Natures chief and sweetest quire, Him with chearful notes admire, Chanting every day their Lauds, Whilst the Grove their song applauds. Though their Voices lower be, Streams have too their melody. Night and day they warbling run, Never pause, but still sing on. All the flowers that gild the Spring, Hither their sweet musick bring. If Heaven bless them, thankful they Smell more sweet, and look more gay. Only we can scarce afford Due thanksgivings to our Lord. We, on whom his bounty flowes, All things give:, and nothing owes. Wake for shame, my sluggish heart, Wake, and gladly sing thy part. Learn of Beasts, of Springs, and Flowers, How to use thy noble Powers. Call whole Nature to thy aid, Since 'twas he whole Nature made. Joyn in one eternal Song, Who to one God all belong. Live for ever, glorious Lord, Live by all thy works ador'd; One in Three, and Three in One, Thrice we bow to thee alone. Of Flesh. All Flesh is Grass, doth therefore rot. For why? Can man be born to live, and not to die? 'Tis happiness to leave this life and world, And have our names, where joys are rife, enroll'd. The dead ne're fear what Death can do: his blast Will come no more; for why? that wo is past. Then to the Soul appeareth Love and Joy: For God will not his Turtle-Dove destroy. Then though a Torch-light here, 'tis better far To be put out, and after rise a Star. The Grave. Though Clay, my Cottage is secure: Princes do dwell with me; And my foundations do endure for aye. Death waits on me, and with his dart Sends me the stoutest he, And, Champion-like, commands the heart to stay. Then be he Rich, or be he Poor, A Spark, or else a Clown, They lie together on the floor, and so They sleep as if they lay upon The softest Bed of Down. Troubles are fled, and Griefs are gone: for though The Body naked in the cold Earth lies, The Soul sings Hallelujahs 'bove the Skies. An Infant. Earths little Morsel, Man's small Letter, And Adam's Copy; no one better Before he tasted Eve: Nature's fresh Picture drawn in oyl, Which time and handling oft doth spoil. His Soul appears like Paper white, That yet had scarce bore word aright; Neither knew how to grieve. But purest colours, without pains, Are subject most to spots and stains. He is above the tempts of Devil, Since he can't understand an evil. His days are raw and dull: Nor hath he yet agreed with sin To banish joys, let sorrows in. He cannot yet be counted wise; And being dumb, he with his eyes Sings silent tunes of Lull. He kisses all, doth them approve; His Innocency is his Love. Nature and Parents, much alike, Do sometimes dandle, sometimes strike. With hidden sugred bait They him intice, and he doth sup Whate're he finds within the Cup. Could his weak body finde the way To Bliss, and here no longer stay, He'd have a happy fate. Not knowing sin, or mortal crime, He'd reach Eternity betime. The Candle. Like as vain man I downward grow, My life is ever wasting; I fall by fire, still waxing low, As man did fall by tasting. My house of Tallow doth decrease, And I that am but Cotten, Within one hour live and decease, Am in the next forgotten. O Lord, pour Oyl into my Lamp To light me to thy home, That when it shall extinguish't be, I may a Star become. The Ant. Although a creature small, yet all My labour, pains, and care ('tis rare) Is in the Summer to provide Against the Cold and Winter-tide. And though so small, yet I an eye Can have to things: for when weak men Waste time in Feasts and Riot, I study for my Diet. Idleness breeds Distempers, Povertie, Gives room for Sin; ye Sluggards, learn of me. The Thanksgiving. Come, let's adore the gracious hand That brought us to this light, That gave his Angels strict command To be our Guard this night. When we laid down our weary heads, And sleep seal'd up our eye, They stood and watch'd about our beds, To let no harm come nigh. Now we are up, they still go on, And guide us through the day; They never leave their charge alone, Whate're besets our way. And, oh my Soul, how many snares Lie spread before our feet? In all our hopes, in all our cares, Some dangers still we meet. Sometimes the sin does us o'retake, And on our weakness win; Sometimes our selves our ruine make, And we o'retake the sin. O save us, Lord, from all those darts That seek our Souls to slay; Save us from us, and our false hearts, Lest we our selves betray. Save us, O Lord, to thee we cry, From whom all Blessings spring; We on thy Grace alone rely, Alone thy glory sing. Glory to thee, eternal Lord, Thrice blessed Three in One, Thy Name at all times be ador'd, Till time it self be done. Antiphon. A Dialogue in three parts. Chor. Thanks be to the Lord on high, Angels.

The Book of Books, The only good To him that looks For heav'nly food A Holy Light In darkest night The blessed Word Of God the Lord. Divinitie In it doth lie. Indeed it is The Gate of Bliss. The Dream. I Dreamt my Death was but a sleep, My Grave and Bed both one; And when the morning forth did peep, Life came, and Death was gone. Since so it is, that none can be Asleep but such as die, O Lord, I'll sleep to all but thee, And make my bed on high. The Beatitudes. Bless'd are the poor, that is, the meek in spirit; For they the Heav'n, God's Kingdom shall inherit. Blessed are they that mourn away their years; God hears their sighs, hath bottles for their tears. Blessed are they that thirst for Righteousness; They shall be fill'd more than we can express. Bless'd are the tender, merciful of minde; They that in mercy give, shall mercy finde. Bless'd are the pure of heart; their Sanctitie Shall lead them to the Holy Deitie. Bless'd are peace-makers; they shall make abode, As Children with their Father and their God. Blessed are they that suffer in a cause That's just; their suffering is their applause. Blessed are they that persecuted are, And when Revilers do no venom spare. When Disconcent sets all things out of frame, Patience is Physick; Prophets us'd the same. Of Angels. My Soul, in thy Devotions always say, O God, my God, Lord, hear me when I pray: Let not or Saint or Angel, though sublime, Share of that honour which is due to him: For if you give not God your Heart, your All, You Cæsar rob, to pay your Tythes to Paul. Nor ought we to the Saints to shew neglect, As if the objects of our disrespect. Dives in his distress cry'd out for water To Abraham a Saint: It is no matter, We know what Dives was, and will forbear To follow him that ran into a snare. Of Christ's Passion. From Circumcision to the hour of death, Alas sad fate! Christ's Passions still kept even with his breath, Such was his state. He first was in a Manger wrap'd, In dangers nurs'd, and often scap'd. As he of Graces had the richest store, So likewise he Of Tears, of Sweat, of Blood, and yet much more, Could not be free: For Emulation then was understood; As now it is, 'twas dangerous to be good. And he that seeks for Peace 'mong men, Shall finde it—But the Lord knows when. On St. Paul's Conversion. So shin'd that glorious Sun upon this Saint, That falling down he did both fear and faint. It was the Light of God that shin'd, whose weight Might sorely press, coming from such a height; Encompass'd round, so that he could not flee From that same voice, why persecutest thou me? From that same date St. Paul's Conversion came, And he grew Master of a shining Fame. On Christ's Praying. Christ in the Garden prays, enclos'd with Trees, And earnestly importunes on his knees, That Cup might pass; but see his Son-like skill In praying, Father, if it be thy will. From whence I learn the duty of a Son, It is to say, Father, thy will be done. On Honour and Valour. Honour and Valour being once at strife, Which should atchieve most glory in their life, Honour did much, went on, would not give o're, Valour flew boldly on, and did much more. The World's uncertain; Honour he was beat, Yet Valour's head must serve for Honour's seat. On Tinder. To Tinder like, each strike That Satan gives My Soul receives. With ev'ry Match a Catch, My Soul does get When he doth hit. Hereafter I will flie Temptations all, so shall My Voice be rightly tun'd, and apt to say, I'll worship none but God, and him obey. The Litany. O God the Father, God the Son, That made, and did redeem each one, And God the Holy Ghost, look on us, miserable sinners. By thy most bloody sweat and Cross, By thy pretious death and loss, By thy ascending up from dross, Good Lord deliver us. In all our troubles, time of wealth, In time of sickness, or of health, In Deaths sad hour, which comes by stealth, Good Lord deliver us. We sinners do beseech thee, Lord, To prosper, and increase thy Word; Unto thy Church good Rules afford, We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord. That it may please thee to endue All Ministers with knowledge true, That we with profit may it shew, We beseech thee, &amp;c. That Grace and Wisdome may increase, That Wars and Jarrings all may cease, That we, thy people, may have peace, We beseech thee, &amp;c, That it may please thee to bestow On us thy servants here below, Hearts that shall praise for what we owe, We beseech thee, &amp;c. That it may please thee, be the way For their return that do each day Deceive themselves and go astray; We beseech thee, &amp;c. That it may please thee, by thy hand To strengthen those aright do stand, Others to raise by thy command; We beseech thee, &amp;c. That it may please thee, succour those That grief and tribulation knows, When persecuted by their foes; We beseech thee, &amp;c. That it may please thee to preserve Captives in danger like to starve, And from Childe-bearers not to swerve; We beseech thee, &amp;c. That it may please thee to defend The Fatherless, and to the end Thy blessings to the Widows send; We beseech thee, &amp;c. That it may please thee, pity all, And keep our Enemies from thrall; Fetch home their hearts that from thee fall, We beseech thee, &amp;c. That it may please thee to bestow On us the kindly fruits that grow; Be God and friend unto thy foe, We beseech thee, &amp;c. That it may please thee to forgive Our sins, that we upright may live According to thy Word, and thrive. We beseech thee, &amp;c. O Son of God, we pray thee hear; O Lamb of God, do not forbear To look in mercy on each Tear; We beseech thee, &amp;c. After our sins, O do not us regard, Nor after our iniquities reward. Lord have mercy upon us, Christ have mercy upon us. Let us pray. Our Father, &amp;c. On St. Michael the Archangel. We praise thee, Christ, among the quires Of Angels, who thy voice obey, That art the life of Heart-desires, Thy Father's Power and shining Ray. Whole myriads of heav'nly Peers Fight for thy cause in close aray: But Michael, who thy Standard bears, The Cross of Safety does display. He the pernicious Dragon threw Into the flames of Hell's Abyss; The Captain with his Rebel-Crew, He thundred from Cœlestial Bliss. Under this Prince let's every one Against Pride's Captain combat so, As that the Lamb may from his Throne Crown Glories upon us below. To God the Father, God the Son, And to the Holy Ghost in Heaven, As hitherto it hath been done, Let Glory evermore be given. Oppositions. God is light, and sin is dark; God lives above, and sin beneath; God is just, but sin's a Shark; God is Life, and sin is Death; God is Heaven, sin is Hell; God is fair, and sin is foul; God saves many that rebel; Sin's Damnation to the Soul. Adam in Paradise did stand, Angels in Heaven by God's command; But sin doth, with a gilded Dart, Not only tempt, but wound the heart. God doth entreat the Soul by love, Sin with deceit the Soul doth move. Sin laid the corner-stone in Hell; Sin made this World a Monster swell. In all to God 'tis flatly opposite, It wants the good of Vertue and of Light. On Thoughts. Still I am thinking thoughts that are not good, They are as common as my food, And do increase like Beans in mud, As thick as any Wood. Suppose I harbour some that do no ill, Nor yet no good, they hurt, when fill To little purpose, lying still, And such a hurt may kill. When I am praying to the Lord my God, They often on my Prayers have trod; And when I hope'd to scape the rod, My sins have still abode. The reason sure why I am thus possest With such a bold unwelcome guest, (Unto my shame be it confest) It is because his Nest, With my consent before, was builded there, Who now lies lurking like a Bear, Watching my sinful Soul to tear, When once got in his snare. Lord, be my Surgeon, heal my wounded heart, And give me grace, that by that Art I may devise a Bolt or Dart To cause such thoughts depart. For with repentant tears it is confest, Thou art a help to men opprest; When we are most of all distrest, Thou art our chiefest rest. With fervent Zeal unto thy aid we flee, Thou art our Rest; Truly our hope's in thee. On Repentance. Repentance is a gift which comes from high, We are not with it born; None of themselves repentantly can cry, Or make the World his scorn. They're carnal Christians think it is enough To mingle Lord have mercy with their stuff. We Jewels buy, and they prove counterfeit, So man himself undoes. Thus in Repentance Souls themselves do cheat, And their rich Jewel loose. Which made one say, Repentance would not lin, Until it damned many more than sin. If we repent for sin, 'tis nothing worth, Unless we do refrain From it as well: for if we from our birth Delighted to be vain, Yet sometimes weep, but still our hearts do harden, God will us with a Contradiction pardon. The sorrow of this World it worketh Death, But godly sorrow that Repentance works, and that eternal breath: The Lord himself doth hate Man for his sins, that numberless do flush, And for those sins doth love as much the blush. Repentance strips us of those Garments black, That the first Adam's was; It kills our sins, and keep us from the wrack. Though now we are but Grass, It doth revive: Our Tears do water so, That we like Plants of Paradise do grow. All, above all thou art, O God most just, Repentance grant to me, That I may cleanse my Carnal house of Dust, And make it fit for thee. Teach me that Lesson which doth still remain, With dayly Tears to wash my dayly stain. Repentance should appear before I die; Nor can I know the when My dying-day shall come, or when I flie From hence to thee agen: Therefore give me Repentance ev'ry day, So shall my flight be clear, and thou my way. No better showers extinguish can the flames Of Hell, than sinners Tears. Begin betimes, trust not to after-games, For they bring after-fears. Have little cause to say, Wo's me, that I, Who liv'd a sinner, must a sinner die. We all are apt to think it is too soon Repentance to begin; We put it off from morning until noon, From thence do farther spin; Whenas we hourly should prepare a room To entertain our God when he shall come. Beda makes mention of a certain man, Who lying very sick, Was counsell'd by his Friends his life to scan, And to repent, while quick: Who said, His sins he would not yet shake off, Lest if he should recover, then a scoff To his Companions he himself should make: But still he waxed worse; His Friends then counsell'd him again to take Repentance, not his Curse: He answered them, That then it was too late, For he was plung'd in a condemn'd estate. Better it is by far from sin to flie, Than lack Repentant cure; For he that hath no wounds fears not to die, But liveth safe and sure. 'Tis good for any man, more for his ease, Neither to know the Cure nor the Disease. On the Day of Judgment. Ah, come it will, that dreadful day, Which shall the World in Ashes lay. As David and the Sibyl both could say. How men will tremble and grow pale When Justice comes with Sword and Scale, To weigh the faults, and sort the fates of all! A Trumpet first shall rend the Skies, And all, whereever laid, must rise, And come unto the Bar in Pris'ners guise. Nature and Death amaz'd will stand To see each one rebodied, and Brought to reply himself to each demand. A written Book lie open shall, Containing each ones Charge; and all By those grand Evidences stand or fall. Then sits the Judge himself, and tries; No shifting from All-seeing eyes, Nor scaping seen, whoe're deserves it dies. Oh then poor I! what shall I do? Which Friend or Patron take me to, When Saints themselves are scarce secure from wo? Dread Lord, to thee thy self run I, Who sav'st the sav'd without a why, And so mayst me, thou source of Clemencie. Think, who did once thy pity move, And drew thee from thy Throne above, Cast me not off at last, thy former Love. Thou tir'dst thy self in seeking me, And for my sake di'dst on a Tree; Let not in vain such pangs and labour be. True, thou hast dealt thy mercies home, Yet acts of grace mayst deign to some At least, before that day of Reckoning come. I guilty am e're thou me try, My looks and blushes me descry; But Mercy, Lord, O Lord, do not deny. Thou, who didst once a Magd'len spare, And of a Thief condemn'd took'st care, Bidst me, by these examples, not despair. Not that my Prayers ought can claim, But thou art good, be still the same, That wretched I burn not in endless flame. When from the Goats thou shalt divide Thy Sheep, let me with thee abide, Plac'd in Eternal Bliss, on thy right side: And then (those great Assizes done, The Curs'd to flames tormenting thrown) Say, Come ye blessed, meaning me for one. Lord, this I beg on bended knee, With heart contrite as ashes be, That thou take care both of my end and me. On Sighs and Groans. Sigh on, sad Heart, as hard as Diamond-stone, At ev'ry breathing usher forth a groan: For such, although thou dost not speak, Sufficient are thy minde to break. Or if thy groans are smothered with grief, And steal out softly as a cunning thief, God hears and understands the cry Better than he that lets them fly. For many sighs and groans are poured out, Loaded with thoughts; so that this heavy scout Hath such an Errand then to tell, Where to begin he knows not well. God hath a Bottle for the sinners Tear, And ready is (as we to speak) to hear: Heav'n is attentive to a sinners sute, And sighs are vocal, though the tongue be mute. Knots. Who reads a Chapter when to bed, Shall not have Aches in his head. Who opes his Purse unto the Poor, Shall finde it filling more and more. Whose heart and tongue obey God's Word, Both beats the bush and gets the bird. Who keeps his thoughts from things amiss, Is thinking on his way to Bliss. Who keeps his Conscience pure and clear, Is always feasting year by year. Whose stomach doth for Dainties crave, With his own teeth doth dig his Grave. Who loves his Humour to fulfil, His Humour is himself to kill. Who doth aspire be great and tall, Should carefully beware a fall. Who with good works delights to dwell, Sails fair for Heaven, far from Hell. On Age. The Painter's Pencil sure must go astray In painting to the life a lump of Clay, Who does but seem to live, dies every day. How can he lively paint a man that hath The cold effigies in his face of Death? On Man and Wife. Silence and Patience are the Twins that make Concord 'twixt Couples never to forsake. A Husband good in Words ought to be wise, In Conversation wary, hating lies: Careful Provision ought he to provide. In ordering circumspect, a careful Guide; A Father, Master, and a Friend beside. The good Wife, when abroad she should be grave, Discreet in governing at home, and have Patience to bridle Passions when they move, Learning her Husband to obey and love: Kinde to her Neighbours, courteous unto all; Careful of Children, be they great or small. But chiefly herein there should be no flaws, She should her Husband fear, and he the Laws. The free Prisoner. What though a Prisoner I am now? Time doth allow Instead of liberty, to walk, To write, or talk. What though Distempers make me sicken? They do me quicken. My body in confinement lies, But my Soul flies. What though by nature I am dumb? Then I be become A silent sinner, and my tongue Doth no man wrong. Or what although I loose my sight? Yet if the light Of Divine Graces shine in me, My Soul can see Let sorrows come when God thinks best, They are my Rest: For in afflictions 'tis my Psalm, The Bruise's Balm. If I'm afflicted in this World, I am but hurl'd To Heaven, where all pleasures stand At God's right hand. Th'afflictions of this world of care Cannot compare To those blest Mansions Christ hath wrought, And dearly bought. Dear may I say, because his blood Is that choice flood That drowns my sorrows and my grief, Gives me relief. Thus all things work together for their good, That have lov'd God, and for his honour stood. A Jayl's the centre of this Iron-age, Yet not my Prison, but mine Hermitage. He that can boldly dare, yet justly do, Fortune's his Subject, and his Vassal too. On Sunday. This is the day the Lord hath made, Then let not Christians be afraid; Laying aside all sin, Rejoyce therein. The clearest radiant day that shines Upon the Christians golden Mines. God's holy Torch and Light, That leads aright. The day of our Confession, The Ease of our Oppression, The day of Peace and Rest, Churches our Nest. A Light it is to all the Week, A Summons to the Proud and Meek, That says to Conscience, Fie, Ye go awry. The day that pulleth man from Death, And crowns his head with holy Wreath; That guides him to his Grave, Yet doth him save. The Day of God, so God of Days, It is above my reach of praise: God's with his free accord The Sabbaths Lord. It is the Day-book of a Saint, A Spring for those that thirst or faint: Nor can we say there's one day Like to Sunday; But we'll such thoughts in silence smother, Till we can finde out such another. The Petition. Stand by me, Lord, when dangers STARE; Keep from my Fruit such choaking TARE, That on Confusion grounded ARE. Thou that from Bondage hast me BROUGHT, And my deliverance hast ROUGHT, 'Tis thee that I will praise for OUGHT. O Lord, to evil make me CHILL, Be thou my Rock and holy HILL, So shall I need to fear no ILL. Faith's Mystery. With all the pow'rs my poor Soul hath, O humble Love, and loyal Faith; Thus low, my God, I bow to thee, Whom too much love bow'd low for me. Down busie Sense, Discourses die, And all adore Faith's Mysterie. Faith is my Skill, Faith can believe; As fast as Love, new Laws can give. Faith is my eye, Faith strength affords, To keep pace with those pow'rful words; And words more sure, more sweet than they, Love could not think, Truth could not say. O dear Memorial of that death Which still survives, and gives us breath, Live ever, Bread of Life, and be My Food, my Joy, my All to me. Come, glorious Lord, my hopes increase, And fill my Portion in thy Peace. Come, hidden life, and that long day For which I languish, come away. On the Judgment. Great God, that hast at thy command Both Leaden feet and Iron hand, How shall I stand, How can I look, When thou call'st for thy Dreadful Book? Oh, save me, Lord, I then shall say, I do confess I went astray. Thy Judgment stay; O let thy Rod Chastise with mercy, O my God. O, Christ my Saviour, may it please Thee, thy dear Father's wrath appease, And making peace, Then I alwaies Will strive to magnifie thy praise. Some, it is like, may shew a Book So full of Blanks, that when you look Thereon, a Rook You'll think that man That shews a Scrole with nothing on. But so to do is highly vain: For he that doth just Judgments rain, Can see each stain, Keeps just account How ev'ry Sinner's sins amount. I am resolv'd, when God doth call, To hide not one, but shew him all That wrought my fall; But if my will Exceed my skill, Lord, do not kill. On the Pharisee and the Publican. Two men into the Temple went to pray; The one a Pharisee, who thus did say, I thank thee, God, I am no common man, No unjust person, As this Publican; Twice in the week I fast from my excess, And I give tythes of all that I possess. The humble Publican at distance stood, With head and eyes dejected, as if food, Or heavenly Manna then was to be found Carelessly scatter'd on the dusty ground: But as in bitterness of Soul distrest, He with his hand smote on his troubled breast, Of his Petition this was the beginner, O God be merciful to me a sinner: The other shew'd (rather than Zeal) his pride, But the poor Publican went justifi'd. God doth delight the proud look to abase, And on Humility bestows his grace. To God the Father. Before the closing of the day, Creator, we thee humbly pray, That for thy wonted mercies sake, Thou us into protection take. May nothing in our mindes excite Vain dreams and fantoms of the night. Our Enemy repress, that so Our bodies no uncleanness know. To Jesus, from a Virgin sprung, Be Glory given, and Praises sung. The like to God the Father be, And holy Ghost eternallie. To God the Son. Let others take their course, And sing what Name they please; Let Wealth or Beauty be their theam, Such empty sounds as these. I never will admire A lump of burnish'd Clay; For though it shines, it is but dust, And shall to dust decay. Sweet Jesus is the Name My Song shall still adore; Sweet Jesus is the charming Word That does my Life restore. When I am dead in grief, Or, what is worse, in sin, I call on Jesus, and he hears, And I to live begin. Wherefore, to thee, bright Name, Behold, thus low I bow, And thus again; yet is all this Nothing to what I owe. Down then, down bow my knees Still lower to the ground, While with mine eyes and voice lift up, Aloud these Lines I sound: Live Heaven's glorious King, By Angels bright ador'd; Live, gracious Saviour of the World, Our chief and only Lord: Live, and for ever may Thy Throne establish'd be; For ever may all hearts and tongues Sing Praises unto thee. To God the Holy Ghost. Come into us, Holy Ghost, From thy bright Cœlestial coast, Send us a resplendant Beam: Come, thou Father of the Poor, Come, thou willing Gift-bestow'r, Come, thou heart-reviving Gleam, Thou, of Comforters the best, Thou, the Souls delightful Guest, A refreshing sweet relief; Thou in toyl a resting seat, Temper in excessive heat, Solace to a Soul in grief. O thou blessedest of Lights! Those that love t'observe thy Rites, With thy self their bosoms fill. While thou'rt absent, nothing can Be regardable in man; Nothing can he act but ill. What is sordid, mundifie; Water, what is over-dry: What is wounded, render sound; Pliant make what's hard to yield; Cherish what with Cold is chil'd; Govern what is vagabond. In the faithful that confide In thy mercies, cause reside All the train of Sev'n-fold Grace, Give what Vertue's merit is, Give th'accomplishment of Bliss, Joys of an eternal Race. Amen. On the Holy Trinity. In Sacred sheets of either Testament, 'Tis hard to finde an higher Argument, More deep to sound, more busie to discuss, More useful known, unknown more dangerous. On Christ's Nativity. Mysterious Miracle! the same should be A Lamb, a Shepherd, and a Lion too! Yet so was he Whom first the Shepherds knew, And readily became Sheep to their Shepherd-Lamb. Shepherd of Angels, Men; and Lamb of God, Lion of Judah: by these Titles keep The Wolf from all thy harmless Sheep. Let the whole World flock to thy Fold, Jews and Gentiles, may they all come In multitudes not to be told, Thy Lambs that wander bring them home. Glory be to God on high, Glory to the Deity. On Christ's Triumph to Jerusalem. Behold, we stay; Lord, come away: Thy Road is ready, and thy Paths made strait, With languishing expect and wait The Consecration of thy beauteous feet. Ride on triumphantly; see, Lord, we lay Our carnal lusts and wills all in thy way. Hosanna! welcome to our hearts: Lo here Thou hast a Temple too, and full as dear As that of Sion; but more full of sin, Nothing but Thieves and Robbers dwell therein. Then enter, Lord, chase them, and cleanse the floore; Crucifie all, that they may never more Profane that holy place Where thou hast chose to set thy face: And if our stubborn tongues shall be Mute in the praises of thy Deitie, The stones from out the Temple-wall Shall cry aloud and call, Hosanna! And thy glorious foot-steps greet. The Shepherds Dialogue. In three parts. 1. Come, let us finde the Babe That hath made This our World so full of joy And expectation; That glorious blessed boy That crowns each Nation With his triumphant Wreaths of blessedness. 2. Doubtless he is within the throng, Just among His Angels that divinely sing, Taking wing; So as to eccho to his voice, They rejoyce With Wing, with Tongue, and Heart, That so they do perceive their happiness. 3. But attended is as now With a Cow; The Ox and Mule do all behold With wonder, An homely Stable should unfold The Thunder. Chor. What an Almighty God have we! Great, great, as is our Miserie. On Christ's Birth in an Inne. Bless'd be that Virgin travel'd without pain, And lodg'd within an Inne, A splendid Star the signe: No greater guest did ever come that way; For therein lay The glorious Lord of Night and Day, Who doth o're Heav'n and over Angels reign. He came i'th' time of great Augustus tax; All cry'd, He comes To pay the sums, Or ransom of our lost Humanitie, To set us free From an Impious Emperie Of Satan, Sin, that then bore sway. Inspire our Hearts to be thy lodging place; In each ones brest Take up thy rest: Temples are fitter for thee than an Inne, And let not sin Profane the Sacred Deity within, So to defile the Ornaments of Grace. Of Thoughts. To think upon the Pow'r of God, doth awe me; To think upon Gods Justice, doth affright me; To think upon the Love of God, doth draw me; To think upon God's Mercy, doth delight me: To think upon God's Bounty, that doth please me; To think upon God's Favour, doth endear me; To think upon God's Goodness, much doth ease me; To think upon God's Promises, doth chear me. Thus thinking what I think, doth make me say, The more I think, the more methinks I may. Lord, let my thoughts so firmly fixed be, That I may think on nothing more than thee. To the Creator. Divine Creator, bear in minde, That thou, of our Corporeal kinde The form didst take, when heretofore 'Twas thee a Sacred Virgin bore, Bless'd Mary, pre-ordain'd to be Mother of Grace and Clemencie: Defend us from our mortal foe, Receive us when from hence we go. Jesus, all glory to thy Name, Born of a Virgin; and the same To th'Holy Ghost, and Father be, Through Ages to Eternitie. The Godly Garden. A Godly heart's a Garden full of Flowers Well kept and trim'd, where Herbs of Grace do flourish, Tears of unfeign'd Repentance are the showers That kindly do those Herbs refresh and nourish. Faith is the Prime-rose that doth first appear, Which being rooted well, stands firm and fast. Then grows for ev'ry Season of the year, The choicest Flowers for odour, or for tast. If Weeds amongst them spring to give offence, The Gard'ner plucks them up, and casts them thence. Lord, give me Grace to keep my Garden so, That nothing there but Herbs of Grace may grow. The Soul's Alarm. Awake, my Soul, chase from thine eyes This drowsie sloath, and quickly rise Up, and to work apace. No less than Kingdoms are prepar'd, And endless Bliss for their reward Who finish well their race. 'Tis not so poor a thing to be Servants to Heav'n, dear Lord, and thee, As this fond World believes; Not even here, where oft the wise Are most expos'd to injuries, And friendless vertue grieves. Sometimes thy hand lets gently fall A little drop that sweetens all The bitter of our Cup: O what hereafter shall we be When we shall have whole draughts of thee, Brim-full, and drink them up! Say, happy Souls, whose thirst now meets The fresh and living stream of sweets, Which spring from that bless'd Throne; Did you not finde this true, even here? Do you not finde it truer there, Now Heaven is all your own? O yes, the sweets we taste exceed All we can say, or you can read; They fill, and never cloy. On Earth our Cup was sweet, but mix'd, Here all is pure, refin'd, and fix'd; All quintessence of Joy. Hear'st thou, my Soul, what glorious things The Church of Heav'n in triumph brings Of their bless'd life above? Chear thy faint hopes, and bid them live; All these thy God to thee will give, If thou embrace his love. Great God of rich rewards, who thus Hast crown'd thy Saints, and wilt crown us, As both to thee belong: O may we both together sing Eternal praise to thee, our King, In one eternal Song. On Greatness and Goodness. Greatness is with a strong desire affected, And often sought with hazard, cost, and pain. Goodness, of greater worth, is less respected, Priz'd as a thing both needless is, and vain. Greatness aspires, and sets it self on high, While Goodness walks below with humble pace: The first is follow'd with an Eagle's eye, The last is thought unworthy of the Chace. But Greatness seeks that which is transitory, And Goodness aims at Grace, which leads to Glory, Lord, let thy Grace my mundane thoughts defeat, That I may study to be Good, not Great. The Soul's Yearnings. My Soul pants towards thee, My God, Fountain of Light and Life: Flesh strives with me, Conclude the strife, That so in blessed peace I may Unclay My Spirit; that done, swiftly take My flight to thy refreshing Spring, Where for thy sake, Who art my King, I may wash all my griefs away That day, And conquer Sin and Death. Thou great Triumpher o're the Grave, Whose life and breath Was spent to save A wretched World, make me be stil'd Thy Child; And grant that when I die And leave this World, that then my Soul Above the Skie Thou wilt enroul, That in thy arms for ever I, Even unto Eternity, May lie. The Divine Inquest. Tell me, you bright Stars that shine Round about the Lambs high Throne, How though bodies once like mine, How you are thus glorious grown? Heark, with one voice they reply, This was all our happy skill; We on Jesus fix'd our eye, And his em'nent followers still. As we clearly saw their mind Set and rul'd, we order'd ours; Both this state alone design'd, Up towards this strain'd all our pow'rs. Taught by Temp'rance, we abstain'd From all less for greater goods; Slighting little drops, we gain'd Full, and sweet, and lasting floods. Arm'd with Fortitude, we bare Lesser evils, worse do flie; Mortal Death we durst out-dare, Rather than for ever die. Justice we observ'd, by giving Ev'ry one their utmost due, That in peace and order living, All might freely Heav'n pursue. Prudence govern'd all the rest, Prudence made us still apply What was fittest, what was best To advance great Charity. On those golden wheels of Grace, That Love's fiery Chariot bear, We arriv'd at this bright place; Follow us and never fear. O sure Truth, O bless'd Attesters; O that all the World may prove, Of both these, such strong digesters, That both these may feed their love. Him who made us all for this, Him who made himself our way, Him who leads us unto Bliss, May all praise, and all obey. The Sinners Tears. Shed forth apace, and make a Bath To cure my Soul of sin; Haste out, for God a bottle hath To keep ye in. Every Tear is worth a Crown; It lifts the Soul to Heav'n, Supports the same from sinking down To filthy Leav'n. They're comfort to the Heart, they're ease, Embassadors to God, To beg he may his wrath appease, And spare his Rod. They're holy Messengers of Saints, Sent to him to impart. They're godly sorrows: each Tear paints Their grief of heart. Then flow amain, and weep those fords Or little Rivers dry, And when I've vented all my hords, Then I Will groan because no longer cry; And die, That I may live eternally. On St. John's day. Today Let's sing Joy to the friend of Heaven's King. He in his bosom lay, Secur'd the Keys Of his profound and hidden Mysteries. Those to the World dispensed by his hand, Did make it stand In admiration to behold that light Happily came From the Throne of the Lamb, And to invite Our sinful eyes (which nothing else could see But Fire and Sword, Hunger and Miserie,) Anticipating by their ravish'd sight The beauty of Cœlestial delight. Great Lord of all, O hear me when I pray, That when my heap of Clay Shall fall away, O let thy gracious hand support me up, That on the Lambs rich Viand I may sup: And that in this last supper I May with thy friend in thy rich bosom lie For ever, to eternitie. Acknowledgements. My God, had I my breath from thee, This hour to speak and sing? And shall my voice, and shall my song Praise any but their King? My God, had I my Soul from thee, This pow'r to judge and chuse? And shall my Brain, and shall my Will Their best to thee refuse? Alas, not this alone, or that, Hast thou bestow'd on me; But all I have, and all I hope, I have, and hope from thee. And more I have, and more I hope, Than I can speak or think; Thy blessings first refresh, then fill, Then overflow the brink. Glory to thee, Immortal God, O great Co-equal Three: As at the first beginning was, May now and ever be. The Wish. Oh, that I once were in that City Where Hallelujah is the Ditty, Where Contemplation is the Diet; Sure that's the place where man is quiet. Oh, that I once were in that Court Where all good Spirits do resort, Where Love, and Joy, and Grace abound; Sure that's the place where man is crown'd. Oh, that I once could fly the way From my unfurnish'd house of Clay; For should my Landlord sue for Rent, Too late it would be to repent: But sighs and tears will pay my score; He's merciful, and asks no more. Then whilst thy Fountain hath one Tear to yield, Weep, oh my Soul, and to th'Elizium field Swim in a River of Repentant Tears; Thy Rent is paid, and thou art freed from fears. The Caution. Open thine eyes, my Soul, and see Once more the light returns to thee. Look round about, and chuse thy way Thou meanst to travel o're to day. Think on the dangers thou mayst meet, And always watch thy sliding feet. Think where thou once hast fall'n before, Observe the place, and sin no more. Think on the helps thy God bestows, Contrive to steer thy life by those. Think on the sweets thy Soul doth feel When thou dost well, and do so still. Think on those pains that shall torment Those sinners bold that ne're repent. Think on the joys that wait above, To crown the head of holy Love. Think what at last will be thy part, If thou go'st on where now thou art. See Life, and Death, set thee to chuse; One thou must take, and one refuse. O Lord, be thou my perfect Guide, So shall I never step aside. Still make me walk, still make me tend; Be thee my way to thee my end. All Glory to the sacred Three, One undivided Deity: As it hath been in Ages gone, May now and ever still be done. Of Life. An humane life is but a Play of Passion; What is man's Mirth but Musick of Division? Our Mothers Wombs the Tyring-houses be, To deck us up for Time's short Tragedie: The World's the Stage; Heav'n the Spectator is, To sit and judge who'ts doth act amiss: The Clouds that shade us from the scorching Sun, Are but drawn Curtains till the Play be done. The Power of Prayer. The Sun by Pray'r did cease his course, and staid; The hungry Lions sawn'd upon their Prey; A Walled passage through the Sea it made; From furious fire it banish'd heat away: It shut the Heav'ns three years from giving Rain; It open'd Heav'ns, and show'rs pour'd down again. O may our Pray'rs, dear Lord, approach to thee; Petitions hear, and then propitious be. Teach us to praise thy Name with one accord, That we may sing due praise to thee, O Lord. God and Cæsar. Render to Cæsar, and to God, &amp;c. 'Tis God's command we should be just: why then Let's not wrong him, giving his right to men. Honour to God it is our due to render, And Cæsar's due we justly ought to tender. To both we stand indebted; all we have Must Cæsar's be, if Cæsar please to crave. What matter is it? wherein lies the odds? We all are Cæsar's, Cæsar's all is Gods. Gabriel and Mary. The Salutation which the Angel brings, Imports, that joys come and depart with wings. Gab.—Hail, blessed Mary, never cast thy mind To trace the passage of this pleasing wind. Mary.—What voice is this that calls me blessed? when Gab.—Stay, wandring thoughts, 'tis I: thou'rt bless'd agen, Blessed of women. Mary.—Oh, I faint, I die. Gab.—Eternally thou liv'st: Again, 'tis I; God hath thee favour'd so, as to entomb A blessed Saviour in thy blessed Womb. Mary.—How shall this be? alas, my Lord, how can I bear a Childe, that never knew a man, But am a Virgin pure? Gab.—Farther attend: Of his Dominions there shall be no end. Thou shalt be shadow'd by the Holy One, And what thou bearest shall be call'd his Son. Mary.—Then, Lord, behold thy Hand-maid, let it be As thou hast said, All shall be bless'd in me: That Angels may rejoyce, and Men may sue; That Devils may believe, and tremble too. Judeth's Prayer. Thus lowly on my face, with Sack cloath spread, To God on high, with Ashes on my head, I come to pay my Vows; to him alone, The Lord God of my Father Simeon, Who with his Sword became a just Revenger On a (Virginity) polluting stranger. O Lord, my God, I pray thee bow thine ears Unto my Pray'rs, accompani'd with tears. The Widow of Manasses lifts her voice, Let all that put their trust in thee, rejoyce. Behold, O God, (though Enemies may smile) An Israelite in whom there is no guile; To thee I trust; Experience teacheth well, They're not all Israel are of Israel. Th' Assyrians do multiply each hour With Horse and man; they glory in their pow'r; They trust in Shield, in Spear, in Bowe, and Sling, Not knowing thee the Lord, whose breath can bring Destruction to them all, and lay their Fame In Ashes; God, the Lord it is thy Name. Gird me with strength unto the Battel, Lord, Teach me to manage Holofernes Sword; Turn thou its edge until, at thy command, Thy servant Judeth take it in her hand; Then be my Battel-ax, for, Lord, with thee I'll Kingdoms ruine, and make Nations flee: The Horse-man and his Rider shall no more Isr'el defie; their Captains shall adore Nebuchadonezor no longer; for thy Rod Shall make them understand that thou art God. I, though a widow, have conceiv'd a pow'r; But my designes lie harbour'd in a Bower Of pleasing fancies: for, O Lord, at length I must to thee for Judgment and for Strength. Let my deceitful lips finde craft to smite Th' Assyrian Prince, and those in him delight: Bring down their pride, that they may understand Thou canst work wonders by a womans hand: For, Lord, thy power is not bound by scope, Thou sav'st in dangers when there is no hope; And in thy Name I'll go, and dare to do, That those Thy Foes Shall fear and tremble too. Judeth and Holofernes. Hol. Be of good comfort, woman, let not fear Presume to have an habitation here: I never injur'd any man or thing That willing was to serve the Earth's chief King. What now is hapned to thy people, they By their perverseness have hewn out the way: But, fairest of your Country, let me know Whither your wandring Beauty means to go? And why thou fledst to us, leaving those whom Dame Nature hath commanded from thy Womb, Thy name in golden Letters to entomb? Jud. Receive the Cause thy Hand-maid shall relate, Who will resolve in truth the same to state: Follow the way thy servant shall direct, And God will thee undoubtedly respect. As lives Nebuchodonozor thy King, Who sent thee to support each living thing; Man shall obedience pay to thee, and all The Beasts, Fowls of the Air, and Cattel, shall Live under thy command: for we have hear'd Thy wisdome makes thine Enemies afeard. Most true it is, a Sword is not the Rod Can scourge our Nation, till against their God They sin: Now Death hath got the upper hand, Their Meat and Water fail, they're at a stand What to do next, and do resolve to cause Some things to be consumed, which the Laws Of God have held unlawful; Tenths of Oyl Which was once for the Priests, is now for spoil. A License from the Senate they expect, As if that Cloak can cover their neglect: Now when 'tis brought, they'll doat without delay, And Justice shall condemn them that same day. And I thine Hand-maid, knowing this, am fled, To work such wonders with thee, when they're spread, Those that shall hear, shall stand astonished. Thy servant serveth God both day and night, And is religious, trusting in his might. Let then thine Hand-maid to the Valley go, And pray to God, then shall she surely know The time that they intend to act their sin, And consequently when thou may'st begin To seize upon Judea for thine own, And make their great ones to become as none. And it shall come to pass that there shall be Not one shall dare to lift his hand to thee. Thus will I lead thee through the midst of them, Until thou com'st before Jerusalem; And in the midst thereof thy Throne shall stand, And give to Nations far and neer, command. Hol. God's strength be with thee; sure he sent thee here T'encourage us, and put our foes in fear. Your Beauty and your wisdome do conspire, The World should Judeth's vertuous name admire. Proceed, fair Lady; surely if thou do As thou hast spoken, then will I be true To thee, and to thy God, and thou shalt dwell With Nebuchodonozor. We will tell The Nations how thy Vertues do excel. Here's Wine enough; when this is gone, we'll then Revive the Banquet with the blood of men. Jud. My Lord, now will I drink, because my state Is more by much exalted now of late Then e're it was, since Nature did display Over mine eyes the banner of the day. Hol. This Wine benums my joynts, my limbs do feel As if each one would with the other reel. Since so it is, I'll stretch me on my bed. Jud. Do so, my Lord—And I'll secure thy head. Thou need'st not fear those at Jerusalem; They shall not come to thee, thou go'st to them. Judeth's Song of Thanksgiving. With Timbrels and with Cymbals raise A tune, wherewith our God to praise. Divinity, afford me Balm For sins, and skill to sing a Psalm Of praise to God did Heaven frame. Exalt him, call upon his Name: He breaks the Battels of the strong, And I that was the Camps among Of proud King Assur, even then When Israel seem'd a Prey to men, Then did the Lord direct my ways; I came from thence to sing his praise. Out of the Mountains from the North The Enemy came thundring forth. Their strength did threaten dismal ills, Their numbers covered the hills; He brag'd he would my Borders burn, And make Jerusalem an Urn; And kill my young men with the Sword, Dash Infants brains against the board, And make my Virgins prove their spoil; But God prevented hath their toyl: A Female hand By his command Hath conquer'd the Assyrian Land. Our mighty foe, he did not fight, Nor did the Sons of Titans smite: Neither did Giants force his care, But Beauty was his only snare. The daughter of Merari went With resolution to the tent Of Holofernes, drank him dead, And safely brought away his head. Thus, Lord, I ventur'd to commit Two sins, and sacrifice my Wit. But with a chast and holy eye I shun'd ways of Carnality. My people, Lord, I knew should live, And thou art ready to forgive. I boldly went, was not afraid, Because assured of thine aid; And to allure, I thought it good The Garments of my Widowhood To lay aside, and did attire My head, to raise my beauty higher. My Sandals ravished his eyes, And he became my beauties prize: For then to give his pride a check, I strook his Fautchin through his neck; Which act did make The Persians quake; The Medes stout hearts did likewise ake. Thus my exterminating arm, By inspiration, did alarm A mighty Host, and did destroy Their chief Commander, once their Joy. A new Song to the Lord I'll sing: Thou art a great and glorious King, Wonderful in strength and might, Invincible, the God of Fight: To praise thy Name all things accord, For thou mad'st all things with a word: In thee all Creatures shall rejoyce, Not any can resist thy voice. Mountains and Waters shall remove, Rocks melt as wax, if they not love. Shall man be subject to obey, And his Inferiours go astray? Do we not see, year after year, God's merciful to them that fear? All Sacrifice too little is For him that is the God of Bliss. The saviour of the heart is sweet, And he that fears the Lord is great. Wo to those Nations that arise Against my Kindred: they a prize Shall be to Worms; their flesh, as meat, The Ravens of the field shall eat, Whilst in Bethulia all my days I'll spend to celebrate his praise. On Man's Creation. We were created with a Word, a Breath; Redeemed with no less than Blood and Death: How much a greater labour is it then, Sinners to cleanse, or breathe Souls into men? The Mornings Ejaculation. Now, that the Day-star doth arise, Beg we of God with humble cries, All hurtful things to keep away, Whilst we in duty spend the day: Our tongues to guide so, that no strife May breed disquiet in our life: To shut the casement of our eye, Lest it admit of vanity; Preserve the heart both pure and free From vain, and troubled phantasie: To tame proud flesh, while we deny it A full cup, and a wanton diet; That when the day-light shall go out, Time bringing on the night about, We, by leaving worldly ways, May in silence sing God's praise. The Evenings Ejaculation. O Lord, now night's return'd again, Our Bodies and our Souls refrain From being soil'd with filthy stain. Let not dull sleep oppress our eyes, Nor us, the enemy surprize; Nor fearful dreams our minde affright, While the blackness of the night Holds from us the cheerful light. To thee, who dost by rest renew Our wasted strength, we humbly sue, That when we shall enclose our eyes, Pure and chast we may arise, Making Morning-Sacrifice. All honour, Lord, to thee be done, Thou ever-blessed Virgins Son; With the Father and the Spirit, As is thine eternal merit, E're and ever to inherit. On Tears. Tears! the sweet Musick of harmonious Souls; Angels rejoyce, and ready are in shouls To dance thereto; it is their heav'nly skill, Their Master's bottle, with such pearls to fill: And when the Soul in Sin's consumption lies, No Balsam's better than the briny eyes. God loves not waters of a common ford; All Rivers are not pleasing to the Lord. When Esau wept, it was to think upon His Brothers fraud; with indignation His Tears were mix'd, his whispring thoughts within, Cry'd, 'Tis my loss I prize beyond my sin. Tears of Dissimulation too, invite Men to believe, God knows the Hypocrite. When in devotion we our Case impart, We should remember, God requires the heart. Tears of Contrition give the piercing voice, At which both God and Angels do rejoyce: Such as were Mary Magdalens, who spent Full thirty years in weeping, to repent. St. Peter likewise, waking, look'd as sleeping, His face b'ing surrow'd with continual weeping. The Spouse, of whom in Canticles, her fears, Like pools of Heshbon, glaz'd her eyes with Tears. As Musick on the water sounds more sweet Than on the land, so Pray'rs, with Tears, they greet Almighty God with prevalence: all hours God listens to effectual Oratours. Then let our Tears into a deluge flow, To drown our sins, and wash away our woe: May they shoot forth like showers in the Spring, To bathe our Souls in; 'tis an Offering Well pleasing to the Lord. When Peter wept, He look'd more lovely than as when he slept. David pathetically ever sung, When Heart and Harp with Penitence was strung: When to repose he laid his weari'd head, Not Diamonds, but Tears adorn'd his bed. And in the sacred Quire there's much more mirth For one repentant sinner (so by birth) Than persons just, Repentance needing none, Though of an hundred there should want but one. To Heav'n comes none but what are pure and cleer; Heaven would not be Heav'n, if Sin were there. On Humane Frailty. The World's a Monster, And a humane life So full of strife, That a dry morsel better may suffice With quiet, than contentions sacrifice. Man is conceiv'd In sin; when born Become a scorn; Addicts himself to vanities and lyes; Poysons himself with sin, then bursts, and dies. Then, O my Soul, That thou may'st thrive, Fix thus to live: Serve God, and love thy Neighbour; not for gains, Self-service will but cheat thee for thy pains. Consider well, Thou canst not buy Eternity, But pious Pray'rs and Tears must be thy cost; For Heav'n is not so soon obtain'd as lost. Prepare thy heart, For that's the room Where God must come: Then mind not things that are but transitory, But entertain thy God, the King of Glory. He when he comes Will be thy Guest, Himself the Feast. Of Earth no expectation thou canst have, But live a sinner, to become a slave. On the worth of Wealth. The good that is in Riches doth consist In the right use thereof: for if we list To shew it in its lustre and its worth, It must be us'd like Ointment poured forth. The womans box, if it had not been broke, Its vertue (like the dumb) had never spoke. So hoarded Wealth that hath much labour cost, By being so recluse, its worth is lost: The sweet refreshments of those glittering Embers Infuse a heat in Christ's distressed Members. He that is covetous may justly write On rusty heaps, This ore corrupts my sight: They breed but Care, and are for nothing good; Might cloath the Naked, finde the Hungry food. Chrysostome well observes, he is not rich That lays up much: He is more happy which Doth much lay out, but not in ways profuse; It's all one, not to have, and not to use. He that relieves the Poor with what he hath, Makes for himself a purging healing Bath. He that hath pity on the poor, doth lend Unto the Lord: and God's our firmest friend. On Formal duty. Tradition doth of Ovid thus relate: His Father with him holding strict debate On Poetry, commanded him rehearse The profits (not the pleasures) of a Verse, By words as well as frowns, did plainly threat. Ovid, when thus in danger to be beat, Beg'd mercy of his Father for his Crime; But in his begging made this warbling Rhyme: Father, on me pity take, Verses I no more will make. How many promises, Lord, do I gather, When I in Prayer petition thee, my Father? I promise to forsake all sinful snares, And yet I sin, even when I say my Prayers. The weakness of my Prayer, time being spilt In vain, serves only to increase my guilt: For when at Prayers I seem to wish them past, As Jews the Pass-over did eat in hast. Bodily-motion is the cause of heat; But in Devotion we should sigh, not sweat. Advice to Prisoners. A Prison is a Cage of certain Cares, Whose Birds sing tunes of Discords and Despairs. So fares it in this fickle World; Man's like a Foot ball toss'd and hurl'd: Even the Poor and honest Prisoners lie Like silver Swans, to sing their last, and die. But what's a Prison when the Soul is free? A Jayl is but the World's Epitome: There ye contemplate how to lie I'th'Grave, before ye come to die; Whilst others heaping up their stores of Pelf, Have no more land, when dead, than you your self. Consider, there are thousands are so low, That they'd be glad to be as ye are now. Your want of Liberty's a Rod To scourge you neerer to your God. Thus Providence to Prisoners is most kinde, Their eyes to open, leaving others blinde. What's your Confinement but a certain Rule That leads to Happiness, Afflictions School? To know no sorrow, is no more Than to be equal with a Boar. A Prison is an honourable Jayl, When a cleer Conscience is the Pris'ners Bayl. Let Reason be your Vertue and your Guide; Impatience will but make your Wounds more wide. If any be afflicted, pray: It is to sorrows an allay. Is any merry? let this be his Psalm; Strike harder, Fate, for every Bruise is Balm. Since by misfortunes it is so decreed, That ye should all things (but a Prison) need, Grieve not at sorrows come to day, To morrow they may pass away. To be dejected is but to deprive Your selves of finding out a means to thrive. If you're despised, pity those poor Elves That laugh at you before they know themselves. You have paid dear to know your Doom; To morrow theirs perhaps may come. He that can glory in his large Estate, Is but a subject (as your self) to Fate. Happy's that Pris'ner that can live above The reach of Malice, or intrigues of Love. There's no light object to pervert The candour of an upright heart. Those Iron-bars that do your bodies hold, Are far less burthensom than Chains of Gold. Where Care will help, there have a careful heart; Where Care will not, ne're act a foolish part: For all the help that Care can do, Is but to make one Sorrow two. Pine not with Care, but modestly be jolly: To be more wretched than ye need, is folly. On Vain-glory. In his devotions unto God, the Lord, He gives no Alms unless upon Record; And if his good deed happens to appear, 'Tis often sent to the Almighty's ear: Pharisee-like, Behold, Lord, all my store, Half of the whole I give unto the Poor. Twice in the week I fast, and do bestow My Alms on those whom I deserving know. If an ill fortune doth molest his minde, He's apt to think God shews himself unkinde; As if it were decreed he should inherit Heaven, therefore upbraids God with his merit. He can fulfil Commandements, to try An earning God with superfluity. In pious bounties lies upon the lurch, And writes them in the windows of the Church: Bare heads in concourse of a publick street, Tickles his fancy more than doth his meat. Stands at his door taking his Fork from sheath, And though his stomach's empty, picks his teeth. And when abroad, he's first that doth begin To call for Pheasants at a common Inne: Cheapens rich Jewels, slighting those are worse, Although he hath no Earnest in his purse. He's ever on the stage to shew his Art, And when abroad, still acts a glorious part: Thinks all men view the Vertues of his mind, When he's indeed a Bladder full of wind; Skin full of words, unnecessary tool, The Fool's great Idol, and the Wise man's Fool. He that is truly wise is silent found; The emptiness of knowledge makes a sound. On Peace. I Sought for Peace, but could not finde; I sought it in the City, But they were of another minde; The more's the pity. I sought for Peace of Country swain, But yet I could not finde, So I returning home again, Left Peace behinde. Sweet Peace, where dost thou dwell? said I, Methought a voice was given, Peace dwelt not here, long since did fly To God in Heaven. Thought I, this Eccho is but vain, To folly 'tis of Kin: Anon I heard it tell me plain, 'Twas kill'd by sin. Then I believ'd the former voice, And rested well content, Lay down and slept, rose, did rejoyce, And then to Heaven went; There I inquir'd for Peace, and found it true; An Heav'nly Plant it was, and sweetly grew. Prayer for Peace. Blessed Saviour, God of Peace, When storms arise, or shall increase, Say thou the word, and they shall cease. Allay their fury, quench their rage, Whose factions would disturb the Age, Their fiery zeal do thou asswage. Be thou a Comforter to those That never do the Truth oppose, Them strengthen, and convert their foes. On Mercy. Mercy is comfort to the Poor; 'Tis that the Rich desire: Lord, we thy Mercies do implore; 'Tis that the Saints require. Mercy it was that gave us life, To move, to think, or say; Mercy is Physick for our grief, And teacheth us to pray. O how can we for mercy call, That have so wicked been! Our Parents gave us such a fall, 'Tis hard to rise agen: Yet 'tis for Mercy still we crave, 'Tis that which must us raise; Mercy first made, and now will save, And teach us how to praise. Our sins increase more than our days, Yet Mercy lets us live; 'Tis God that we for all must praise, That doth these mercies give: And shall we still run on the score, Not paying any part Of what we ought to him before? He asketh but a heart. My Soul, pay what thou canst of all thy store; He that pays nothing, ever owes the more. The Swine. Lord, I am thine, Although possest; O be thou mine, And give some rest To me a beast. O Christ, be good To sinful man, And with thy blood, Lord, wash me clean: Be thou my food, My staff, my stay; My King, my God, And thee alway I will obey. Command my sins into the Sea, That I may praise and honour thee. The Penitent. Lord, I'm a sinner, and my sins increase To such an unknown sum, That should my rockie heart and eyes, Nay, my whole Microcosm, a flood become, And drown it self in Tears, 'twould not suffice To name my score, Not then to pay: But, Lord, thy blood is my rich store, Thou art the Patron of the Poor; But all the Balsam of thy blood, Alas, I know will do no good, Unless I wash my griefs with Tears before. O thou whose sweet and pensive face To laughter never gave a place, Instruct mine eyes, Without delay, To melt away, And then the less of Balsam will suffice. The Soul awaked. Lord, we again lift up our eyes, And leave our sluggish beds; But why we wake, or why we rise, Comes seldom in our heads. Is it to sweat, and toyl for wealth, Or sport our time away, That thou preserv'st us still in health, And giv'st us this new day? No, no, unskilful Soul, not so, Be not deceiv'd with toys; Thy Lord's Commands more wisely go, And aim at higher joys: They bid us wake to seek new Grace, And some fresh vertue gain; They call us up to mend our pace Till we the prize attain. That glorious Prize, for which all run Who wisely spend their breath; Who, when this weary life is done, Are sure of Rest in Death. Not such a rest as here we prove, Disturb'd with Cares and Fears; But endless Joy, and Peace, and Love, The Pleasures of the Spheres. Glory to thee, O bounteous Lord, Who giv'st to all things breath; Glory to thee, Eternal Word, Who sav'st us by thy death. Glory, O blessed Spirit, to thee, Who fill'st our Souls with Love; Glory to all the mystick Three, Who reign one God above. St. Paul's Petition. From Enemies, where're they be, My God, do thou deliver me: From them that do against me rise; From private Foes inventing lyes; From bloody men, who loving strife, Endeavour to ensnare my life. The Mighty are against me bent, Because I sinn'd, and do repent. Arise, and visit with thy Rod Those Enemies of thine, O God; Their follies shew, that they may be At last, true followers of thee. On the Conscience. Corruption now adays doth spring so fast, So regarded, And rewarded, That if my tender Conscience would be sold, Or if for it a Dispensation Could be but got, I doubt it not, I'd store up wealth in this our Nation. One spark of Flattery would so increase My evil goods, So that my woods Would make a lasting fire, when I decease. The World's fond love might easily be bought, If I could tell The way to sell The little honesty that I have got. Were but this World my home, perhaps I might Be apt to trade, But here things fade: Give me the Riches wherein Saints delight. Though now I live in a corrupted Cell Which doth annoy, I would enjoy The peace of Conscience there where Angels dwell. Love upon Earth is good whilst that doth last; But the choice love Of God above Is everlasting, and doth never wast. Tush, wicked World, Heav'n is my Merchandize; If in my way My sight should stray, My home shall be the curtains of mine eyes. A desp'rate fate it is the Worldlings run, A Pearl to sell To purchase Hell: They must be great, or to be just undone. St. Austin's Prayer. Recommended to the devout Christian by P. Urban the 8th. Before thy holy eyes, O Lord, We sinners heartily accord, Humbly to own our griefs of heart Are nothing to our just desert. The evils we have done, exceed What we can write, or may be read. Our Consciences our Souls affright, And say, Thy Chastisements are light. We feel the punishments of sin, And yet we do persist therein. Weak Nature faints at ev'ry scourge, Yet perverse wills do dayly urge. Our restless minds do still provoke Thy Justice, and despise thy Yoke. We sigh away our days in grief, Yet sorrow gives us small relief: For when our sighs do once expire, We wallow in our former mire. If we repent, 'tis at a rate, That we had need repent for that. If thou revenge our stubbornness, Thy Justice doth our hearts depress. Thy anger fills our Souls with fears; We weep, but soon forget our Tears. If thou stretch out thy hand, we then Promise to turn to Saints, from men; But if thy Sword suspension shows, We then forget to pay our Vows. If thou dost strike, we pardon crave; And when thou pardon letst us have, We sin again, and ne're give o're, With provocations more and more. Thus we our guilty selves accuse, Thus we thy mercies do abuse; Yet Mercy, Mercy, still we cry, Or we are drench'd in misery. Then, Lord, O let thy goodness give Those streams by which the Angels live; Our Souls inspire, amend our days; Touch thou our tongues, and we shall praise. All glory be to God on high, The Father of Eternity, To Three in One, and One in Three. The Believer. Happy is he that doth The truth Believe; for he it is Shall kiss The Son of Righteousness, shall surely come By his believing, to believers home. Let thy belief be true; But few There are that do make that Their State. Abraham left a Pattern good behinde him; But few there are that seek him, less that finde him. I do believe a Tree Will be Pleasantly green, when I With eye In Winter judge how leaveless then it stood; But I confirm it when I see the Bud. In Thomas 'twas a fault To hault In waving Faith, until His will Was satisfied; but 'twould a madness been So to continue, having felt and seen. Belief, it may indeed Exceed The strength of Reason, yet Doth let No opposition in: Faith likewise will suspence, 'Twill get above, but not against the Sense. Whilst Faith assures I eat My sweet Redeemer, with direct Effect, Sense cannot so in ignorance allure me, As that I eat not bread, but will assure me. Although I see not all that I believe, Yet those things that I see I must believe. Christians must guard their mouths, and watch their actions; Be pure in heart, and keep their faiths from factions. On Christ's Nativity expected. When, blessed Lord, shall we Our safe Salvation see? Dear Lord, arise, For our faint eyes Have long'd all night, and 'twas a long night too: Poor man could never say, He saw more than a day, One day of Eden's seven; The guilty hours were blasted with the breath Of sin and death, And have e're since worn a Nocturnal hue. But in thy birth is hopes, that we At length a splendid day shall see. Wherein each poor neglected place, Grac'd with the Aspect of thy face, Shall glister like the porch and gate of Heav'n. How long, bless'd Lord, how long? The Nations thirst, and throng: All humane kinde Are now combinde Into one body, wanting thee, their Head. Large is our multitude, And almost vile and rude, Headless, Great God, for lack of thee, Unhappy for the want of thy bless'd face; Then come apace, And thy bright self to our dull body wed, That thorough thy Almighty power, Each part that hath confusion wore, May order take, so to appear Fresh as the dawning of the year, When thou, dear Lord, shalt so united be. The Call. Come away, my Lord, my Life, Thy presence doth preserve from strife. Come away, my Lord, my Way, Thy presence teacheth to obey. Come away, my Lord, my Truth, Thy presence turneth Age to Youth. Come away, my Lord, my Light. Thou dost both Sin and Satan fright. Come away, my Lord, my Feast, That my poor Soul may be thy Guest. Come away, my Lord, my Strength, By thee my days have health and length. Come away, my holy Joy, Guard my Rejoycings from annoy. Come away, my dearest Love, Lord, let my Call thy presence move. Come away, Divinest Lamb, My sins deface, that seek to damn. Come, my Shepherd, come away, Thy Flock in danger are to stray. Come, my Safeguard, and my Shield, In Fights assist me, lest I yield. Come away, Lord, hear my Call; Make no stay, Thou All in All. The Extasie. Such a Lord and such a Life, Whose presence bringeth Pleasures rife. Such a way as leads to Bliss, Who walks therein can't walk amiss. Such a Truth whose Ray defies The Father and the Prince of Lyes. Such a Light as leads us to Eternal Comforts not a few. Such a Feast as doth rejoyce, Compounded of the best and choice. Such a Strength as doth defend Not for a day, but to the end. Such a Joy that giveth store Of Pleasures, lasting evermore. Such a Love as heard my cry, Though sin made me his enemy. Such a Lamb whose sweet abode Makes ev'ry Saint a Lamb of God. Such a Shepherd of his Sheep, There's none can stray whom he doth keep. Shuch a Shield and such a Sun, Defends and shines till all is won. Open, my heart, and such a God receive; He's All in All to them that do believe. Delights of the Minde. Jesus, the only thought of thee Fills with delight my memorie; But when thou dost thy presence show, Heav'n seems into my breast to flow. No Theam so sweet for voice can be, Nor to the ear such harmonie. No heart can thoughts for charming frame As Jesus his most pretious Name! Jesus, when for our sins we grieve, Thy mercies all our wants relieve. If good to those that seek thy Grace, What art thou when they see thy face? Jesus, in whom we comfort finde, Fountain of Life, Light of the Minde: Thou dost our hearts with comforts feed; Our utmost wish thy gifts exceed. No Eloquence of Tongue can teach, Nor art of Pen this secret reach; Only th'experienc'd Soul does prove What sweets they taste who Jesus love. Him then I'll seek, retir'd apart, Shutting the world out of my heart; And midst my business him I'll strive, With fresh pursuit still to retrive. Early with Magdalen, I'll come A Pilgrim to my Saviour's Tomb; Weeping my sins in mournful cries, I'll seek him with my minde, not eyes. My Tears shall on his Grave distill, And faithful Sighs the Garden fill: Prostrate before him on my face, His sacred feet I'll fast embrace. Jesus, in thy bless'd steps I'll tread, Striving to follow where they lead: Nor shall my Soul give o're to mourn, Till to thy favour I return. O Jesus, most admired King, Who didst triumph o'r deaths sharp sting, Thy mystick sweetness first excites, Then satisfies all appetites. Thy quickning visits Life bestow, Thy lights true good so cleerly show, That they who once have relish'd thee, Know all the World's meer Vanitie. Come then, dear Lord, possess our hearts, Enflame our loves with thy chast darts; All Clouds of errour drive away, And change our Night to thy bright day. To thee our hearts and voices sing, To thee our vows and pray'rs we bring; That when we end this life's short race, In Heav'n with thee we may have place. On Death. O Death, the Serpents Son, Where is thy sting? once like thy Sire, With Hellish torments, ever burning fire; But those dark days are gone. Thy peevish spite buri'd thy sting In the sacred and wide Wound of a Saviour's side. Now thou'rt become a tame and harmless thing, A toy we scorn to fear: For we hear That our triumphant God to conquer thee For the assault thou gav'st him on the Tree, Hath took the keys of Hell out of thy hand, And forc'd thee stand As Porter to that gate of Life. O thou who art the gate, be pleas'd that he, When we shall die And that way flie, May ope the Courts of Heav'n to us through thee. On Judgment. Judge of the World, we wretched sinners quake, Our Consciences do ake; And well they may, whenas we think Of the fierce dreadful fire Of thine Ire, And Phials thou shalt make Us sinners drink: For thou the Wine-press of thy wrath wilt tread With feet of lead. Wretched notorious dust! what uncouth place Can shelter from thy face? The Earth will shrink out of thy sight; The Heavens too, that cannot erre, Then shall fear Thee and thy Laws, and from thee take their flight: So burnt with glory, their bright eyes shall, dead, Burst from their head, Great God, can we, Thy Enemies, abide to see Such a glorious Majesty? We beg thy mercy, Lord: Thy Judgment-seat We dare not to intreat, For we are all condemned there. Lord, then O cast a look On thy Book Of Life; behold, we read A Saving Jesus here, And in that Name our sure Salvation see: Lord, make us free, And cross within Our scores of sin; That cancel'd, all our debts are paid by thee. On Heaven. Bright glorious Lord, uncircumscribed Treasure Of everlasting Pleaiure, Thy Throne is placed far Above the richest Star; Where thou prepar'st a splendid place Within the glory of thy face. That each Spirit May inherit, Who builds his hopes upon thy merit, And thee adores with holy charity. No ravish'd heart, seraphick tongue, or eyes Inspir'd, can once surmise, Or speak, or think, or see, So bright Eternity. The glorious King's transparent Throne Is of pretious Jasper-stone, Where the eye O'th' Chrysolite With a Skie Of Di'monds, Rubies, Chrysoprase; But above all, thy brighter face Speaks an eternal Charity. When thou thy Jewels bindest up, that day Forget not us, we pray; But there where the Peryl lies, Christal too, above the Skies, That there thou mayst afford us place Within the glories of thy face, And enroul Each ones Soul In the Scroul Of Life and Blessedness, that we May praise thy Name unto Eternitie. On Hell. Dismal darkness, sad, and sore, An everlasting Night; Groans and Shrieks, when sinners roar In their abyssful plight No corner there but hath a Snake Breeding in the infernal Lake: Heaps of Fire, and Beds of Snow, Are the chief delights below. A Viper springing from the fire Is his hire That prizeth moments to Eternity. O thou God of Day and Night, Fountain of eternal light, Allelujahs, Hymns, and Psalms, Holy Coronets of Palms, Adorn the Temple evermore. Almighty God, Let not thy Iron Rod Bruise our bones with an eternal pressure; Let thy mercy be the only measure. If thou shouldst hoard up wrath in store, We shall all die, Not one be left to glorifie The Lord, and tell How thou preserved hast our Souls from Hell. The Salutation of Saints. Jesus, who man's Redeemer art, The solace of each godly heart; The ransom'd World's great Architect, Chast light of Souls which thee affect. What mercy conquer'd thee, my God, That thou wouldst bear our sinful load? And innocent wouldst death endure, That us from death thou mightst secure. Still let commiseration press To give our damages redress; And by fruition of thy sight, Inrich us with a blessed light. Thou guide to Heav'n, and path to Rest, Be thou the scope of ev'ry brest; Be thou the comfort of our tears, Our sweet reward above the Spheres. On Pride. The proud man looks that ev'ry one should shew A Reverence to him, though none they owe. I'll value such, as we do coyn, set forth Just what they go for, rather than their worth. Pride unto Reason seemeth ever strange; Is Reason absent? there 'tis Pride doth range. And then for Reason, there is none beside That is so highly opposite to Pride: For Reason maketh Art Dame Nature's ape, And Pride turns Nature out of Nature's shape. Jeremiah's Lamentation For Jerusalem's Desolation. Consider, Lord, the wretched, poor, and vile; A glorious City! no, sh'as lost that stile; She and her joys are under an Exile. Behold, and see; Thou, Lord, as in a Wine-press, hast her trod, And crush'd her Virgins with an Iron Rod: Sin was the cause; but, Lord, thou art her God. May it please thee, To wipe away her Tears that do pour down, Cause thou that art the Comforter, dost frown; O let repentant Tears offences drown, And send relief. O all ye passing by, behold her sorrow; Jerusalem, Jerusalem would borrow Tears of ye all; but none will say, Good morrow; The more's her grief. Her Sucklings sigh, and cry for Corn and Wine, Whilst she her self for want thereof doth pine. Jerusalem, was ever grief like thine? Behold, and weep; She that was call'd the Joy of all the Earth, Is Desolation now, and nothing worth: Her sorrows to her Enemies are mirth. Her Lovers sleep. The apples of her eyes do finde no rest, Their streams o'reflow the flood-gates; she's distrest, And sorrow doth become a constant guest: Doth never fail. Her old and young ones, both lie on the ground; Her Priests, and Prophets, thou dost deeply wound; Terrours on ev'ry side beset her round On hill and dale. Wormwood besots, she seems as she were drunk; This angry tempest hath her treasure shrunk; She that was full of people, now is sunk, And desolate. Her Soul's remov'd from any glimpse of Peace; Prosperity is fled; there doth increase But sad effects of groans, which never cease; Such is her fate. They that on Delicates were wont to feed, In Dust and Ashes now lament their need: Jerusalem is bow'd, and broke indeed; But God is just. The Enemies they did her Maidens finde, And ravished; her Young men forc'd to grinde: Consider, Lord, how she with grief hath pinde Upon the dust. Remember, Lord, her Wormwood and her Gall; Oh hear her sad complaints, and ease her thrall: Lord, hear my Pray'rs and Tears, for her I call, In mercy see. Oh, lay that darksome Cloud from off thy face; One smile will say, thou think'st upon her case: Oh hear, and help her, Lord, of thy good grace, Thou glorious Three. Judge and revenge her cause, O Lord, my God; Behold her scorners, how they mock and nod; In mercy towards her withdraw thy Rod. Lord, let her cry Unto thee fly, And let her not Be quite forgot, As if, O Lord, she never were, That she may sing Of thee her King, That unto thee none may compare. On Sin. Sin is such an uncouth thing, I cannot well define it; Death doth own it is his sting, God bids me undermine it. But it so cunning is, that when I think to win the day, It now comes over, under then, And blows my baits away. It seiz'd my Parents, and beguil'd More learned men than I; And when I think it is most milde, I have most cause to fly. At Church when I Devotion have, It hovers o're my book, And bids me think upon my Grave, And off the other look. Invisible it is, no doubt, And felt before 'tis seen; It subtilly can wheel about, And like an Angel seem. Good deeds I know accepted are, And will be evermore; But if I do not well, I fear Sin lieth at the door; Sin, as a Serpent, cunningly Doth lurk upon the scout, That if my foot but tread awry, My sins they finde me out. If I with Brother break my word, The fact may not be great; But if I sin against the Lord, Who shall for me intreat? Many the faults are of my Youth, I have been oft misled; But they are blessed, saith the truth, Whose sin is covered. Wherefore, O Lord, I will confess What in those days I did; O grant thy merciful redress, And let my sins be hid. But I with heart and knee will bow, In duty to adore thee; Then recollect, and study how To set my sins before me. Shap'd in Iniquity I was, A wretch of little worth: In sin my Mothers womb, alas, Conceiv'd, and brought me forth. Lord, with thy grace enrich my heart, Take out the filth therein; Let fools pursue their idle Art, To make a mock at sin. Wo unto them their sins do draw With ropes, them fast to tie; That bind Iniquity their Law With cords of Vanitie. If sinners could but count their score, They'd fear a future doom: Let him that sinneth, sin no more, Lest worser things shall come. Whoso doth his transgression love, Careless, or lose, or win, He strangely doth himself approve To be a slave to sin. Lord, fix my heart still towards thee, Especially at Pray'r, Lest my Petition on my knee, Become to me a snare. Surely the quintessence of sin, Satan that Judas is; He turns a murtherer, when in Leads the poor Soul amiss, And kills it with a kiss. The Check. Peace, rebel Sin, and dare not to rebel, For thou art dead Without the Law; and thou that cam'st from Hell Art Captive led. How durst thou say to him that dwells on high, The Holy One, Look on the World where all my wealth doth lie? 'Tis all as none. Or yet, how durst thou say unto the Christ, If there be none Like thee, or if by thee men do subsist, Make bread of stone? I read, the sting of Death is sin; but yet Sin, that came first; Poor Infant-man no sooner on his feet, But fell, and burst. 'Tis said, that sin the Child is of the Devil; But sin, thou art His elder, and the very self-same evil Caus'd him to start. Then prithee say, What is thy name? for Death and Devil, they, Right understood, Are both too good. To the God of Heaven. Bright builder of the heav'nly Poles, Eternal light of faithful Souls! Jesus, Redeemer of Mankinde, Our humble Pray'rs vouchsafe to minde; Who, lest the fraud of Hell's black King Should all men to destruction bring, Didst by a strong impulse of Love, The fainting World's Physician prove. Who from a sacred Virgins womb, Didst an unspotted Victim come Unto the Cross, to cleanse the sin The wretched World was plunged in: The sound of whose high Pow'r and Name, No sooner any voice can frame, But all in Heav'n, and those that be In Hell, bow down their trembling knee. Thee, Christ, who at the later day Shalt be our Judge, we humbly pray, Such Arms of heav'nly Grace to send, As from our foes may us defend. Be glory giv'n, and honour done To God the Father, and the Son; And to the Holy Ghost on high, From Age to Age eternally. The Flower. O That I were a lovely Flower In Christ his Bower; Or that I were a Weed, to fade Under his shade. But how can I a Weed become, If I am shadow'd with the Son? On Darkness. How, Sinner! Darkness better far than Light To be preferr'd? It is because the Night Draws a thick Curtain over your black deeds; But God's All-seeing eye no Curtain heeds. If he should shew severity to men, And you in Hell, you'd hate your Darkness then. On Love and Hatred. I Love too much, to hate what I should love; I love too much, to love what I should hate. My Love and Hatred in wrong Centres move, Such hateful love, God doth abominate. I love not Goodness, neither hate I Evil: My Hate to Vertue's hot, to Vice is cold. I love too little God, too much the Devil; My Love and Hate, wrong Objects do behold. Lord, change my Love to Hate, my Hate to Love, That so thy Justice may of both approve. On Justice and Mercy. Justice doth call for Vengeance on my sins, And threatens Death as guerdon for the same; Mercy to plead for pardon then begins, With saying, Christ hath undergone the shame. Justice shews me an angry God offended, And Mercy shews a Saviour crucifi'd: Justice says, I that sinn'd must be condemned: Mercy replies, Christ for my sins hath di'd. Grim Justice threats with a revengeful Rod; Meek Mercy shews me an appeased God. Lord, though my sins make me for Justice sit, Through Christ let mercy triumph over it. On Food. A Man with all things needful may be fed; God for both Soul and Body Food hath sent. That for the Body is material bread, And for the Soul his Word's the nutriment. If Bread I want, my Body then must perish; Without the Word, my Soul will fail to thrive: He that sends both, sends both of them to cherish, To keep both Body and the Soul alive. Famine of Bread is a destructive Curse; But Famine of the Word is much more worse. Lord, to my Soul thy Heav'nly Food apply; Give that a life, although my body die. Christ, All in All. Christ is the Rock on which my Faith must build; Christ is the Staff on which I safe may lean; Christ is for my defence the safest Shield; Christ is the Fountain that must wash me clean. Who builds not on that Rock, doth build on Sand; Who leans from him, trusts to a broken Reed; He falls that fights not under his Command; His Blood alone doth make me clean indeed. Christ cleanses, saves, supports my feet from fall: He is my only Rock, my All in All. Lord, to my Soul such Heav'nly Grace impart, Thou may'st be Lord and Tenant of my heart. I would, but cannot. I Would be rich, but Riches fly away; I would be great, but 'tis with Envy blended; I would be fair, but Beauty doth decay; I would be brave, but 'tis with Pride attended. I would be worldly-wise, but that is Folly; I would be strong, but 'tis a Beast-like guise; I would be thought religious, that's unholy; I would be learned, but it makes not wise. These vain Endowments soon draw to an end; To each there is a But that doth attend. Thus Fate, who stops the race of worldly glory, Shews such Endowments are but transitory. The Voyage. The World's a spacious Sea that's large and wide, And man a little Barque that sails therein; His thoughts do drive him like the Wind and Tide; The shelf that threatens shipwrack is his Sin. His Heart's the Pylot that this Ship doth guide; Faith is the Freight with which he freely trades; His Anchor, Hope: Thus doth he safely ride; Heav'n is the Haven where the Barque unlades. Needs must the Merchant in his Voyage thrive, That safely doth at such a Port arrive. Lord, be thou Pylot to this Ship of mine, That both the Ship and Lading may be thine. The Careless Christian. I Do desire my Prayers may be heard, Yet I my self regard not how I pray; I fear God's wrath, yet have I no regard To what I do, or what I think, or say. I know his Promises are just and true, Yet do I live as I believ'd them not: I hear he Judgements hath for each ones due, Yet careless I not terrifi'd a jot. Searching my heart to finde the cause of this, I find that in my heart no grace there is. Lord, since thy Grace will rectifie my course, Grant me that Grace which breedeth true remorse. On Life and Death. The life I live on Earth uncertain is, Being attended with a certain death, Which will produce eternal Bane, or Bliss, Waiting the expiration of my breath. It doth behove me then to have a care How I my short and pretious time do spend, Lest I, through sin, be trapt in Satan's snare; Griefs then beginning when my life doth end. Lord, grant as Life and Death do here begin, My Life may be to grace, my Death to sin. The Seeker. Away, fond Youth, Vertue is hid in Truth; Your Vanities can no contentment bring, Alas, give o're, Thy pleasure's but a sore, Honey at first, but in the end a Sting. Seek not in vain, So to augment thy pain; Such is thy grief, that nothing surer is. Fond Youth, give ore, Woo not a festring sore; When thou hast found, thou'lt wish that thou didst miss. Love not this world, but minde the things above; In seeking so, thou shalt finde love for love. The Steward. It is not much I have, yet I have more Than some that live more splendidly than I. Although I am not rich, I am not poor, But have enough to vanquish penury. All that I have is lent me, and I must Give an account to God how I do use it; Or if I hide it up, and let it rust, Or by miss spending wastfully abuse it, It had been better I had poorer been, Than ti'd a slave (in chains of gold) to sin. Lord, grant my Talent so on me bestown, May be employ'd as thine, and not mine own. The Cœlestial Painter. O Thou most holy God of Bliss, Who paintst the Heaven's centre cleer, In burning brightness fair address, With goodly lights, as doth appear. Who on the fourth day didst ordain The fiery circle of the Sun, And for the Moon an order set, And Stars their wandring course to run: That thou might'st give the Nights and days Divided bounds to keep them in, As an allured mark to know How duly all the Months begin. Illuminate the heart of man; Wipe out the soulness of the minde; Cast down the heaps of our misdeeds; The bands of guilt do thou unbinde. Grant this, O holy Father most, And eke the Son equal to thee, Together with the Holy Ghost, That reigns in all Eternity. The Holy Innocents. Hail, you sweet and budding flowers, Whom (when you life began to taste) The enemy of Christ devours, As whirlwinds down young Roses cast. First Sacrifice to Christ you went, Of offered Lambs a tender sort, With Palms and Crowns, you, innocent, Before the sacred Altar sport. Glory, O Lord, be given to thee, Whom the unspotted Virgin bore; All glory to the Trinitie, From all, both now and evermore. To the Divine Creator. O God, which diddest man create, And hast alone all things assign'd, The Earth to bring forth savage Beasts, And creeping things each in their kind. Great bodied Creatures are ordain'd By thy great Word and Will, to live, In times and seasons man to serve, To whom they all subjection give. Put from thy servants far away What to uncleanness may allude, It self in manners to suggest, Or in our actions to intrude. Give us the recompence of joys, And yield to us thy graces free; In sunder break the bands of strife, Confirm the bands of Unity. The New Birth. A Multitude of Creatures do agree To give their Documents to wretched man, As Emblems and Examples, whereby he May learn to write himself a Christian. The Eagle casts her bill, the Ass his hair, The Peacoak sheds his plumes, the Snake his skin; And shall not Man, a Creature far more fair, Renew himself by shaking off his sin? Old sins retain'd do fester as they lie; To the new man belongs felicity. He that would clear himself from worldly slain, To sin must die, to life be born again. Die to the flesh, and if you would inherit Eternal life, be born then of the Spirit. This is the Birth a Christian should prefer; For being born of God, he cannot err. Lord, let thy Grace my idle thoughts subdue, That I may change the Old man for the New. Degrees of Love. If I a Creature love, it may not know The Channel whence my flood of Love doth flow: But God knows all mens hearts, and will approve Of love to him; for God himself is Love. If I a Creature love, it no regard May have to make amends; God doth reward. But when my kinde affections do intrude, The Creature answers with ingratitude. If I a Creature love, that Creature may Be captious, peevish, making me its prey. The love of God exceeds the love of men; For loving him, I've love for love agen. A humour too, may make a Creature fly me; But loving God, I have him always by me. If I a Creature love, that very thing On which I dote, may prove to me a sting. But to love God, brings comfort, joy, and ease; For he's the everlasting Prince of Peace. If I a Creature love, my care must be For that; but God will Angels charge with me. If I a Creature love, my hearts desire Is all inflam'd but with Terrestrial fire; But loving God, my Soul and Senses feel The holy flames of a Cœlestial Zeal. If I a Creature love, for face, parts, limb, That moves; God dwells in me, and I in him. If I a Creature love, it doth not know All my affairs; God knows whate're I do. If I a Creature love, it doth deceive me; If I love God, he's ready to relieve me. If I a Creature love, much pain and grief Attend; but loving God, I finde relief. If I a Creature love, we both must die; But God gives life to all eternitie. If I a Creature love, I oft behold Those slights and faults, which make my love grow cold; But if on God I firmly fix my love, The love of God doth make my love improve. He is so good, so noble, rich, sweet, fair, Mighty and wise, so exquisitly rare, I'll court his love (as he hath taught) with Prayer. Bad at Best. My Practice gives the lye to my Profession; I give too large a rein unto my Will; I do not grieve enough for my Transgression, But do delight in contemplating ill. I wish for Heav'n, but tread the path of Hell; I love the day, but more the deeds o'th' night: Little I have, yet that I use not well; I covet much, but covet not aright. Good deeds ill done, run clearly 'gainst the byas; Wishes and words are winds, our deeds must try us. My ways are evil, sin doth too much attend them; Open mine eyes, O Lord, and I shall mend them. Time's Travel. The uberous womb of Time, since its creation, Innumerable issues hath brought forth, Of strange, and of prodigious generation; And glorious things of beauty and of worth: It's never barren, but is ever breeding Unwonted forms, and various shapes of things. It was, it is, and will through time succeeding, Continue labouring. The fruit she brings, Savours of goodness, but much more of evil; Extols the Maker, but adores the Devil Lord, since there is a time to laugh, to weep, 'Tis high time I awake out of the sleep Of sin and death, O then propitious be, And in due time let true Repentance free My Soul, and I'll be convert unto thee. The Widows Mite. Room for a wealthy Benefactor; he, Behold, draws neer unto the Treasury: Others approach with their abundant store, But here's a Widow, who, although she's poor, Hath outdone all, her bounty to display; For her's was giv'n, and theirs but cast away. And she was noted for a true believer; For God delighteth in a cheerful giver. Gabriel and Zacharias. Gab. Bless'd Zacharias, cease to be afeard, A John shall call thee Father, thou art heard. He shall be richly stor'd with Grace and Mirth; The God of gods shall celebrate his Birth. Zac. O Lord, whereby can I know this? my life Is well-nigh spent; likewise my ancient Wife, Her years are so in number, I am bold To say, for bearing Children she's too old. Gab. Is any thing impossible to God, Whose Power can do it with a word, or nod? I that am Gabriel, am sent down from high To do this message from the Deity: And seeing thou believ'st not what I say, Behold, thou shalt be dumb until that day. Then will I loosen that which now I strung; Thou shalt have John, &amp; with that John a tongue. On Alexander the Great. Thou Earth's great Monarch; to thy Valour's praise, Be it recorded, thou didst spend thy days In Mars his School; but one thing did remain, Thou shouldst have made thy Piety thy gain, Not Ostentation. Flesh was made thy slave, But wherein didst thou Satan's works deprave? Those being vanquish'd, thou might'st take thy rest, And weep for joy, as being stout and blest. Alas, his Conquests are as good as none, That fights for Worlds, and never finds but one. Jesus Wept. Hence may we see Tears are the only things, When watring well, revives our fading Springs. Martha and Mary sprinkling pious Tears Over their Brother, four days freed from fears. With the sole help of Jesus, when they wept, His Tears and theirs reviv'd a Saint that slept: The very words, Come forth, bore such a sound, Laz'rus straight came, but left death in the ground. Such love our Saviour shew'd his friend, his eye, That knew no sin, could weep, when he should die. The Antients have this observation kept, Jesus was never seen to laugh, but wept. Martha and Mary. As Contemplation is the bane of ill, By that our good is so continued still. Happy that house which never doth miscarry, Yielding a Martha to complain of Mary. On Worldly Gain. This World yields nothing more than Cares and Crosses, Yet my forc'd heart dotes on it ne'retheless; If I cast up my gains, they are but losses: For more and more I languish in excess. It shews varieties of sweet content, Alluring me with fair and golden baits; But in the taste I finde them different, No real pleasures, but meer counterfeits. Delusions are the knacks that do excell For cheats; they shew us Heaven, lead to Hell. Lord, plant thy heav'nly wisdome in my heart, That world and worldly things I may desert. On St. Peter's Perjury. Sheathe up that sharp keen Sword, which did befriend thee In smiting him who gave his ear to end thee; But yet consider, he that doth falsely swear, Is by the Law condemn'd to loose an Ear. I tell thee, Peter, e're the Cock crow twice, Thou art my friend that shalt deny me thrice. But, Peter, thou art favour'd, take't from me, Instead of paying one Ear, thou hast three. On Pusillanimity. Religion made the Martyrs dare, and die; Honour abhors to dread an Enemie. Our Actions try our Courage, and our hearts As Icie weather with its chilly smarts, Do try our health: and this we yearly find, Withered leaves fall with the breath of wind. As rotten Bows no longers hold debate With strength, but break when they're opprest with weight, So Earthen Vessels may be said t'expire, Expos'd when empty to the heat of fire. This trivial passion of Faintheartedness, Dispirits man, and makes a dull impress Upon his body, as if there were writ, Here stands a house, but no one dwells in it. Cowardise doth express a man to be An easie prey unto his Enemie: Whose cruel mercy suddenly is spent, Whilst for the Victim no man doth lament. He grew in misery, became forlorn, Was both to friend and to his foe a scorn. The righteous man is bold, bids fear adieu; The wicked flee, when no man doth pursue. On the Spring. Since Winters cold blasts are expell'd by the Sun, And Fields that did penance in snow, Have put Madam Nature's gay Liveries on, Embroyder'd with flowers to make a fine show; The Hills and the Vallies in duty abound, And men praise the Lord; so the duty goes round. Heark, heark, how the Birds in sweet consort conspire, The Lark and the Nightingale joyn; In every note is an amorous Quire, With an innocent mirth to entertain time. The Hills and the Vallies in duty abound, And Men praise the Lord; so the duty goes round. Methinks the God Pan, whose glad subjects we are, Doth sit on his flowery Throne; We accept his kinde Offerings every year, With Garlands of Roses, and flowers new grown. The Hills and the Vallies in duty abound, And Men praise the Lord; so the duty goes round. On Science. Many for Science seek with care and Art, When Conscience is the Science of the heart; Yet that most sacred Knowledge is become In mens esteem, of Knowledge but the scum. When as the Heart with Conscience doth converse, Infinite mysteries they then rehearse. A Conscience good and pure, relies upon The sacred Title of Religion: That is a Knowledge puffs not up to boast, But is the Temple of the Holy Ghost: Built so for Beauty, equalled by none, Rich as the Temple of a Solomon, The fruitful field of Benediction. The joy of Angels, and the Sinners sting, The Subjects ark, the treasure of the King. An Habitation for the Saints abode, The Book of Life, the Princely Court of God: The Book that's seal'd to keep Deeds from decay, And to be open'd at the Judgement-day. A rich Perfume, and a most happy Guest, A pleasant Friend, and a continual Feast. A Castle, Tower, a Rock to build upon, A certain Fabrick of Salvation. The poor man's Comfort, his most trusty Staff; The rich man's Elegy and Epitaph Wouldst thou be farther in this Science read? Then Purge thy conscience from all works are dead. On Drunkenness. This is a Vice that fights without defence; He that doth finde this sin, doth loose his sense. I formerly have read of one who stood Amaz'd, as lost within a spatious Wood, When in one Vice he was to build his Nest, Which of these three he judg'd to be the best; To kill his Father, Mother to beguile With lust, or rather to be drunk a while. He thinking Drunkenness the least of these, Chose that, thereby God's Justice to appease. Then drunk he gets, making no more to do; And when got drunk, acted the other two. The juicy Vine doth to us ev'ry year, Three sorts of Grapes at once most duly bear. The first for Pleasure, Drunkenness the next, The third for Misery. When man's perplext With too much drink, he is as one deceast, A shape of man, more properly a beast. If all our Trees were Pens, and Seas were Ink, They could not write the mischiefs done by Drink. Awake, ye Drunkards, weep, and howl; Poyson encompasseth your Bowl. On Blasphemy. It sets its mouth against each holy place, And shoots out words like darts, against the face Of God; despising his great Majesty, Imposing things upon the Deity. Thus written 'tis by the Historian, Speaking of the Apostate Julian, When he engag'd against the Parthian Bands, And then receiv'd a wound, with outstretch'd hand: He took his blood (to shew he did persist) And in derision threw it toward Christ, Thus saying, to augment his sinful sum, O Galilean, thou hast overcome. So by an outward gesture we may finde The secret indignation of the minde: And he that doth blaspheme his God, doth broach Designes to cast upon him all reproach His little Wit or Folly can invent, Vainly to shew the reach of his intent. But Julian being wounded with a Dart (Unknown from whence) that reach'd his wretched heart, In scorn to Christ, he Galilean cri'd, Perish'd in sin, so this Blasphemer di'd. Caius Caligula, with judgment dim, His Statue fix'd, that men might worship him. The holy Temple, with profane abuse, He dedicated to his proper use, Making himself a God; but it appear'd At length, that Vengeance this Blasphemes heard. It is a sin that studies how to fight Against the dictates of Dame Nature's light; Which Princess oft have punished with death: The very Turks will not endure that breath That wounds the Ears of Heaven, but punish those That to blaspheming Christ their lips dispose. If Turks to this great sin give a restraint, How piercing must it be unto a Saint? The Sick man's Ease. The Sick man is a Prisoner to his bed, When healthy men have room their wings to spread. Wealth without Health a gilded torment is; Crœsus vast Riches lead not unto Bliss: Nor can the Wealth of all the Indian shore Assure the sick from Agues to restore. Health is a Jewel of such high degree, Not to be priz'd until it wanted be. The sick can nothing do, he's indispos'd; He cannot pray, his eyes are almost clos'd. He restless turns, then on his back doth lie, Whilst pain deprives him of his Piety. But when a good man sickens, God hath sed, He in his sickness will make All his Bed, His Pillow, Bolster, Sides, the Feet, and Head. God taketh thorough care for his Elect, In All his Bed he will be circumspect. And sure that God that suffers a Disease To reign, is best Physician, giving ease. Herein his Art is excellently spread; Not fitting Bed, but Person to the Bed. His Potion Patience is, and that works so, What God inflicts the Just doth undergo. But how shall God make my bed? I have none, Saith the poor man, and saith it with a groan. To him God answers, Son, be thou content, For that's a bed adorn'd with Ornament. Jacob slept on the ground; who would not deem Himself most happy, having Jacob's dream? Fox in his book of Martyrs, speaks of one, A woman poor in Jersey, yet though grown Mean to the World (when Mary, Englands Queen, Drew on our English Stage a bloody Scene) God made her bed in that same fiery flake; And when she came as Martyr to the stake, A Childe came from her, to her hearts desire: So God brought her to bed by flames of fire. He likewise threatned Jezabel, that she Should have a bed of fire. His Justice he Therein displays: May not his Mercy then Turn flames of fire to beds for righteous men? Nothing's impossible if God accord; Fire shall prove Beds of Ease, say he the Word. On Singing of Psalms. Birds sweetly chirp and sing, but Nature gave Me a harsh voice, more fit (than sing) to rave. Should I use Art for a melodious strain, 'Twould be to spend my pretious time in vain. When I sing Psalms and Hymns to God on high, With devout praises to the Deity, How can I think my voice shall please his ear, When to my self it meanly doth appear? Yet though I cannot chaunt a warbling tale With the sweet musick of the Nightingale, Or with the Blackbird chirp, I Swallow-like Will chatter, or will with the Raven strike Or croak my measures, better so to do, Than to be silent; for there may accrew A Blessing by my will. If I want Art, God thus commands, My son, give me thy heart. Had God bestow'd on me a better voice, With better musick I would then rejoyce: But since 'tis so the Spirits influence Shall salve my want of skill with store of sence. To that end, blessed Lord, in me create A heart unfeigned, new; and in that state, With heart and understanding, I'll rejoyce, And rest contented with my present voice. Yet one thing more of God I do desire; Make me a Quirester in Heaven's Quire. On little Sins. Sin at the first seems small; when I begin, I thus conclude, 'Tis but a little sin, I may wade through it dry-shod: So on tilt I run, as if secur'd from sin by guilt; But when into my sin I slily creep, It suddenly appears so soul, so deep, So dangerous a gulph doth widely gape, That without drowning I can hardly scape. Thus in extremities I always bleed; My sins are small, they no repentance need; Or else so great and heynous is any stain, That I despair, I can't a pardon gain. A Reed out of thy Sanctuary, Lord, Would truly measure every deed and word. But O if thou my misery reveal, Do not thy mercy from my Soul conceal, Lest if I apprehend my wounds gape wide, My desperate Soul run out, and thereby glide Into a world of to ments, if my grief Seem to be greater than is thy relief. If sin seems greater by one breadth of hair Than mercie doth, it makes way for despair. No sins are little: 'tis the Devil's cheat So to surmise; for ev'ry sin is great. On Temperance. This guides the Reason, gives the Minde delight, In moderating Lust and Appetite. The Jews in this great Vertue are expert, Shunning excess as men of great desert; Perhaps because it should be understood, They drank full draughts up of our Saviour's blood; And being sensible they did digress, May think it time t'abominate excess. Our English Chronicles do much commend Their Queen Elizabeth, who did transcend The Nobles of her age; and England's King, Edward the Sixth, did in her praise thus sing: When to discourse on her it was his chance, He call'd her his Sweet Sister Temperance. When at her Table she sate down to eat, She seldom us'd more than one sort of meat; And did in Temperance so much delight, She ever rose up with an appetite. Nature is with a little satisfi'd: Ebriety and Gluttony have tri'd, And conquer'd many, who to Death did dance. One of the spirits fruits is Temperance. On Persecution. As the poor Sheep is to the slaughter led In all humility, and free from dread, So all God's people may be said to be As Sheep, the Emblems of Humility. They harmless are, and profitable too, Obedient to their Shepherd; in a crew Led into Folds and Pastures, where, as strangers, They are obnoxious to many dangers, Wolves, Bryars, Thieves, Dogs, Plagues both great and small; But God their Shepherd rids them out of all. Many desire the number may increase Of God's good Sheep; but 'tis a golden Fleece Which they desire to wear: However, they Most happy are that follow him their way. Excellent things the Church of God hath won; She's like a woman cloathed with the Sun, Crowned with Stars, treading upon the Moon; Yet travelling in Birth at night and noon: The Dragon in pursuit of her and hers; But, under God, they still ride Conquerers. He that would be an Israelite indeed, Must arm himself compleatly; taking heed Of all assaults, all persons, places, times, Guard his own vertue, resist others crimes. Elias spoke against the craft of sin; Then Ahab's hate against him did begin. Isaiah, as we read, was sawn in two; It was Manasses pleasure so to do. And Jeremiah he was ston'd, to please The cruel humour of Tahaphanes. Stephen was stoned of the Jews; and John Beheaded was, Herod would have him gone. Ignatius to the Lions had his doom; The Clergy likewise hated Chrysostom: But Justin Martyr slights these things as dirt, Says, Persecutors kill, but cannot hurt. Tertullian well observ'd, the more they mow The Christians down, they much the faster grow. Large Volumes might be fill'd with the bright names Of sufferers by swords, by stones, and flames. True saith St. Paul, all that will shun the grave Of hellish sin, shall persecution have. Well may the Christian with his God comply In persecution, Christ himself could die. On Sleep. Death in the Scripture is compar'd to Sleep: When Death approaches, then with care we keep A schedule of our wealth, so to dispose Of those Estates we then are forc'd to lose. So when Sleep comes, methinks my Ev'ning-prayer Is like the making of my Will; my care Ought therefore to provide betimes: for why? There's danger in a drowsie Lethargy. In perfect memory, and when awake, I'll leave my Soul to God; for if he take Not charge of me, and me in safety keep, The Devil will attempt me in my sleep. Though day and night he seeketh to devour, He keeps his markets in the darkned hour. I on my pillow do my sleep confirm: Thus mans Vacation is the Devil's Term. Blessings of the Righteous, as they are recorded in Holy Writ. Hearken unto the Lord thy God, His Covenants observe; So will he kindly spare his Rod, And not afflict a Nerve. Bless'd shalt thou in the City be; Thy God will Blessings yield, At home, abroad, at bed, at board, And likewise in the field. Blessed shall be thy bodies fruit, and that upon the ground: The wicked, be they loud or mute, Shall neither of them wound. Thy Cattel shall inrich thy store With increase of their Kine; Thy Sheep shall still wax more and more; Thy Grapes shall yield thee Wine. Bless'd shall thy Store and Basket be; Blessings shall thence accrew: Comings and Goings shall agree To make thee blessed too. The Lord shall smite thine Enemies, And put them to disgrace; The chiefest he will make to flie, And that before thy face. Thy foes one way shall thee attempt, But flie before thee seven; From Judgement none shall be exempt, But as the Chaff be driven. Thy Store-houses the Lord will bless, And all thou tak'st in hand; And give to thee a large increase Of plenty in the land. The Lord, as he himself hath sworn, He will establish thee; And farther to exalt thy horn, His people ye shall be. Keep thou the Lord's Commandements, And all the Earth shall see That thou art great in innocence, And stand in fear of thee. The Lord he shall his treasures ope, The Heav'ns shall give thee rain; If head or hand with business cope, It shall be for thy gain. No discontent shall thee attend, As free from grief or sorrow: To many Nations thou shalt lend, But have no need to borrow. Blessed are they that in him trust, He will them bless with speed; For do they hunger, do they thirst, He is their help at need. Blessed is he whose sin is hid, He may with gladness smile; Whose errours all are covered, Whose Spirit hath no guile. Blessed are they that now lament, As being poor in Spirit; For they are promis'd by the Lord His Kingdom to inherit. Blessed are they that now do mourn, Thinking their joys are fled; For though as yet they seem forlorn, They shall be comforted. The meek are blessed too; for they That love not strifes increase, Shall on the Earth bear happy sway, Delighting much in Peace. The hungry too, and they that thirst For Righteousness as meat, They shall be fill'd, when those accurst Shall nothing have to eat. Bless'd be the merciful to those Whom they observe in pain; For he that mercily bestows, Shall mercy reap again. Thrice blessed are the pure in heart, Whose Souls and hands are free From vanity and wicked oaths; For they their God shall see. Bless'd the peace-makers are; for they His children shall be call'd: And he that loves and doth obey, Shall never be enthrall'd, Blessed are they for Righteousness Do persecution bear; Their great reward none can express But Heav'n, it lieth there. Blessed are they that are revil'd Because they seek the Lord; Be they at home, or if exil'd, His grace will strength afford. Rejoyce, and be exceeding glad, For great is your reward; The Prophets by such usage bad, Did get into regard. Curses of the Wicked. He that doth hear the poor mans cry Shall never fare the worse; But whoso turneth back his eye Shall never want a curse. He that himself hath others curst, His servant curseth him; The blessings of his flowing Purse Shall him to ruine swim. He that blasphemeth God his Lord, Ought to be ston'd to death; And cursed be that man, abhorr'd, Serves other God beneath. Cursed be he that setteth light By Father, or by Mother; The people shall him dayly slight, And none his Curses smother. Cursed be he that doth remove His Neighbours Land-mark; then The people shall him curse, none love, But each one cry, Amen. Cursed be he that leads the blinde In an erroneous way; The Lord for him will torments finde, And be the blinde man's stay. Cursed be he that doth pervert The widow, fatherless, Or stranger, from an upright heart; Curses shall him oppress. Cursed, thrice cursed shall he be Covets his Father's breast; And that man curst shall be (as he) That lieth with a beast. Curs'd let him be with Sister lies, Or Mother (though) in Law: Such sins do make those horrid cries That dreadful curses draw. Cursed be he that secretly His silent Neighbour smites: Murtherers too, that cause to die When a reward invites. The wicked shall be curs'd at home, And likewise in the field; His basket and his store at last Shall Blessings cease to yield. Cursed be all his sinful fruit Of body and of land: His Kine, and Flock, though they are mute, And all he takes in hand. Cursed be he when going out, And when returning in; That happy 'twere for him, no doubt, If he had never been. Praises to God. Psal. 65. 1. Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion.

Angels, Saints, and all men cry, Glory be to God on high: And that glory ne'er may cease, Grant us, Lord, on earth thy peace. When there's good will towards men, We shall praise, and praise agen. On Fatherly Affection. As in the street I walking cast my eye, It was my chance two Children to espie Fighting together: by and by in hast The Father of the one, who saw what past, Stept in, and suddenly, without delay, He parted both, and took his Son away, And like a Father, careful of his Son, Gave him correction for the fault he'd done. The other Lad was left without a check, Which made him strut and boast, and stretch his neck, Believing he had surely won the day, Though both alike were equal in the fray. I thought it hard that one should punish'd be And not the other, he escaping free. At last I guess'd 'twas a Paternal care One to correct, to teach him to beware: For over him he a dominion had, But was a stranger to the other Lad. So when the wicked sin, the godly smart; God in chastising shews Paternal art: He chastens whom he loves, whilst wicked men Pursue their sins, and act them o're agen. The reason common sense cannot avoid, Sinners are spar'd only to be destroy'd. What need a whip for stubborn sinners backs, When 'tis decreed their heads are for the axe? On the Gospel. The Gospel ancient as Moses is, Nay Adam, it was preacht in Paradise. 'Tis true, before the Gospel came the Law, Yet from the Gospel we most vertue draw. Likewise before the Day, appear'd the Night, Yet above Darkness we esteem the Light. And before Man was made, all Creatures were, Yet he excells them, they his servants are. He that before his Lord the Sword doth bear, Is not suppos'd superiour to the Mayor. All things which in this world we splendid see, Are not esteem'd by their priority. Saith John, There comes one after me, whose shooes I am unworthy, too low, to unloose. The Law is most compos'd of forms of fears; But in the Gospel streams of love appears. The Law makes God our foe with pointing—thus; The Gospel cries, Emanuel, God with us. The office of the Law is to accuse; That of the Gospel is to heal a bruise. The Law a killing letter's stil'd by merit; But th'holy Gospels is a quickning Spirit. Besides, the Gospel is the bell whereby We all are called to Eternity. On the Lord's Prayer. That Pray'r of Pray'rs, how meanly doth it look Of late, as if Religion's frame were shook! But if the Lord were just to use his powers, With how much anger might he look on ours? Some think that Lesson may their Spirits grieve; Lord, us forgive, as others we forgive. Others, like Witches, when in haste they pray, They it repeat, but do it backward say. Many with zeal desire their dayly bread; Thy Kingdom come, not much concerns their head. Thus temp'ral benefits we do prefer Before eternal blessings, and adhere To what our present wants require: but oh, When Death appears, and whispers, we must go. Then our Petitions, all that we can gather, From his take pattern, crying, Our Father. Christ so began to teach us, being weak; So we conclude when we can hardly speak. The Free Giver. Great Alexander, when he youthful was, A check received from Leonidas His Governour, for being too profuse In wasting his perfumes in pious use: For on a day being to sacrifice Unto the Gods, to shew himself unnice, Fill'd both his hands with Frankincense; that done, Gave it the fire as his devotion. But afterwards when he became a man, He conquered Judea, over-ran That Country whence those spices took their birth, Then to conclude his piety with mirth, He sent Five hundred Talents weight (by odds Too much) to him grutch'd what he gave the Gods. Thus they that sowing plentifully keep A zeal unspotted, plentifully reap. He that doth niggardly his Talent spare, Shall sow, but in the end reap but a Tare. Give God the choicest branches of thy fruit; For by that means God may give thee the Root. The Friendly Advice. The Roman Senators, as we may read, Thirsted that Julius Cæsar might be dead: Wherefore they then conspir'd to seek his end. Artemidorus, who was Cæsar's friend, Gives him a Paper wherein lay his lot, His life to save by finding out the Plot; But Cæsar being busie with applauds, With salutations, and the peoples lauds, Pockets the Paper, as if it had been Petition-like at leisure to be seen; So onward walks, not dreaming of that train, And going to the Senate-house was slain. The World, the Flesh, and Devil, do beset Poor man, contriving divers ways to get Him in their gin. God's Ministers accord To bring a Letter, namely God's own Word, Wherein their plot is publickly reveal'd, The wounded man hath offers to be heal'd; Nay, God himself in clemencie doth crie, Oh house of Israel, why will ye die? But most men generally busie are About the worlds concerns, though things of air; They cannot mind their friends advice; to write, Is to present them with a Paper-kite. Thus men run headlong to expend their breath, Forgetting they before were doom'd for death. On Sloath. The idle man is like the heavie drone, That wasts his time in contemplation: This present hour he's mightily perplext With study'ng which way he shall spend the next; Not like the wise man, who with lesser pain, Contrives to make Expences prove his Gain. Winter he loves, because the days are short; Walks in the Summer, as if A-la-mort. When in the morning he bethinks to rise, First stretcheth arms and legs, then wipes his eyes. His manners lets the morning rise before him; And when the Sun shines, seeming to adore him, Then he bethinks to stir; but first affords A Prayer to God, not making many words, And sometimes none, well knowing he can do With thoughts as much as words, though more than few. He commonly lies still, his bed to keep, More out of sloath, than a desire to sleep; Then yawns and turns himself for want of rest; Anon for Dinner calls, before he's drest: Which having eat, he seems to be in pain, At last concludes, 'tis best to sleep again. That done, he rises, to his Neighbour goes, And in few words doth thus his minde disclose: How do you, Neighbour? 'tis a pleasant day; What's the best news? what price are Mackrel, pray? The days do lengthen strangely, and the Spring Bids us attend the Birds that sweetly sing. Then in the end bethinks to bid adieu; But first he yawns, and cries, What shall we do? So he concludes his Speech: Perhaps in fine, They both agree to drink a pint of Wine. When from the Church all Auditors are gone, He is found sleeping in his seat alone. He enters into Bond, ne'er minds to pay, But forfeits that, 'cause he forgets the day. To be a Jury-man is his disease; Rather than fetch his wood, he'll chuse to freeze. He's half a Christian and half a Turk; His Principle's to steal, and not to work. He is indeed a proper Standing-pool That needs must get corruption: 'Tis a rule Observable, those Pits do soonest stink, Whose mud assists to overflow the brink. The idle Soul shall finde his food grow scant; Sloath casts a man into deep sleeps and want. On Desperation. Chear up, my Soul, thy griefs in time will cease; Despair is Satan's only master-piece: Hearken to that, the Devil soon will tell The ready road that leads the way to Hell. My sin, saith Cain, is great, and I am driven Justly to fear 'twirl never be forgiven. With Murther first he did his Curse begin, And furthers that, by adding sin to sin. Then to despair give neither ear nor scope; Lay hold on Christ, the Anchor of thy hope. A PANEGYRICK To the Right Reverend, And most nobly descended Prelate, HENRY by divine Providence, Lord Bishop of London. Illustrious Prelate! whom the World must own A Father of the Church, a Martyr's Son; Of sacred Function, and of noble Blood; 'Tis a dispute whether more great or good. Thou second Ambrose of the Mitred Lords, Northampton's Helmets the Arms of Compton. Helmets joyn'd with London's Swords, Will keep thy Vineyard from the Forest-boar, Beyond the skill of them who went before. In Rev'rend Henchman we beheld a Look Much like the Frontispiece of Thee the Book; Jehovah's Poem, where he hath annext A gracious Comment to a glorious Text; Urim and Thummim wrote in words at large. Thou Decus and Tutamen of thy charge, Who ex utroq; sitt'st amongst the Peers, A perfect Nestor at meridian years. Old Jeroboam, holy Legends tell, By making Peasants Priests, turn'd Israel With her heels upward. That prodigious phrase Of High swoln Woolsey in King Harry's days, Ego &amp; Rex, may teach great Monarchs what's The sad effects of mounting Butchers Woolsey a Butcher's Son of Ipswich. Brats To any thing but Gibbets. Where such sway, There's none so proud, so tyrannous as they Who suck nought from their Dams but kill and slay. For take an upstart Groom, who fetcht his rise But lately from a Dung hill, in a trice He huffs, and Hamans it as such a rate, As if the slip'ry wheels of Rowling Fate Were scotcht in him, forgetting that the Son May end as basely as the Sire begun. Births are th'immediate acts of God; the choice Of man sounds well, which ecchoes to that voice. The Cream of Gentry, not the Scum of Trade; Princes are born, but Commonwealths are made. Then bless'd be Christ, and Charles his servant, who To silence the rude Cavils of our foe, Has rais'd a Ruler from an antient stock, A Swain (like Dapheis) fairer than his flock; In whom, by happy providence, we see The false aspersion, and foul calumnie, Which Brooke of old cast in the Churches face, Bravely wipt off in nobler Compton's race. Compton the Great! a Family well known From Hapton The place where the old Earl was murthered. Heath, to the Olympick Throne. Compton the Valiant! that bears a power From the Imperial The Bishop of London Clerk of the Closet. Closet, to the Earl of Northampt. Constable of the Tower. Tower. Compton the Just! what can be more exprest? The Guns and Organs shall proclaim the rest. Nor can the mouth of Spite it self defame Th'unsulli'd Trophies of that spotless Name: Nor Malice, choak'd with Liberty, controul The least attempt of so divine a Soul. Had all been Lyons once, who wore that hide, And each Lawn-sleeve so honourably alli'd, Save tem'pral envy and spiritual pride, Smectymaus had not liv'd, nor Cæsar di'd. The Cassock whilom scar'd into a jump, And curtail'd all in rev'rence to the Rump, May now exult with-Warrantable glee, In thy serene unblemish'd Pedigree, With the white The Bishop of Winton, Doctor Morley. Prelate of the Garter Blue, Undaunted Dolben, and couragious Mew, The High-born Durham, generous Hereford, By line a Baronet, by Grace a Lord. And (who should be first nam'd) Sheldon the prime, A word too glorious to be blaz'd in Rhyme. As learned Lawyers justly boast the worth Of their Heroick Finch, and Honour'd North. When Gospel-fury chang'd our Oyl to Ashes, And Pulpits turn'd to Caledonian Dram, in the scotch phrase, as appears by their Let any, Fro au Harlotree, the Dinger of the Swash (i.e. the beater of the Drum) the foul Fiend, and the Gallow-tree, Gude Laird deliver us. Swashes; When Charity caught cold, and zeal ran mad; When men of Levi dwelt in tents of Gad; Black were our Stars, Cimmerian our Night, No Darkness like degenerated Light. But when the Sons of Peers lay down the sharp Faulchion, to tune the Psaltery and the Harp, Abandoning the pleasures of Hide-park, And with King David dance before the Ark, Th'Infernal spirit flies: the Warlike Spear Being beat into a Sheep-hook, shall we fear New Curse ye Meroz Doctrines in these Nations, Clench'd with Edge hill and Naseby applications? Harry the Eighth, that he might propagate Feud against Popery, and secure his State, Dispos'd the then Top-heavy Churches Lands In his Nobilities and Gentries hands; Knowing when time should turn (which often varies) They'd surely fight pro Focis, if not Aris. But our blest Liege, that Piety may greet Her younger sister Policy, thinks meet True Honours Ore should wear Religion's Stamp, To have the Chair recruited from the Camp. His Majesty, in such designes as these, Impropriates the Bishops, not the Sees: Impropriate, did I say? rather restore Them to the Splendour they maintain'd of yore; That when weak Curats fail, these Sons of Thunder May keep the Dan and Bethel rabble under. No Northern storms shall then our Temple stir, Whose Beams are Cedar, though their Rasters Fir. And the rich Pavement which we walk upon, Smooth as the Chariot of King Solomon, Without a stone of stumbling and offence, Or speaking Treason in a Scripture sence; Or crushing Texts until they vomit blood, A signe the Pulpits were not Irish wood. All peevish Sects shall fall from their extreams, Won by thy Worth, and melted by thy Beams, As if thy parts, which we poor Lads admire, Were mixt of Gunning's Light, and Rupert's Fire; Enough to make a Brownist keep the road, And Jenkins chaunt another Palinode. Abingdon Once Chaplain to M. G. Brown at Abingdon. Wild, whose Drolls infect the Rout, May now complain his Pen hath got the Gout; Who bubbled with his once-applauded Irer, Out-did his Name by barking at the Mitre, Shall cease to stroak his half-dry Muses Doggs, In tenderness to's Conscience or his Luggs. The Pagan Saint, whose pretious lips express Nought but sweet Sippets of Soul-savingness, Making the splay-mouth'd Brethren mump like Apes, At Brooks his Apples, and at Titchburn's Grapes, Shall balk his Canting, and convince the Gang, An Anthem's better musick than a Twang. And we Plebeian Off-springs, meanly bred, With a short Grace, an Egg, and so to bed, Yet having Souls where loyal flames are nurst, To Charles the good, and James of Charles the first, Shall (to engage Posterity our debtor) Spend our dear blood as free as if 'twere better. My Lord, accept this Mite; and if it please, Give us thy benediction, and take these. May all the Gifts and Graces that besel On Moses, Joshua, and Samuel, Inrich thy Breast and Brain in such a sort, That the whole City, Country, and the Court, Led by thy good example without stain Of being factious, bruitish, or profane, May win their pristine Glory once again. May as benign and prosperous a state As e'er George Wharton could prognosticate, Light on thy heart, and bless thee o're and o're, Wisdom and Wealth augmenting still thy store. Long may'st thou govern without Guile or Gall, And be thy Moderation known to all, To bring strai'd Sheep, by whatsoever name, Back to the Fold from whence at first they came. No private Meetings in thy Diocess, Except those lawful ones of Truth and Peace: But if the many-headed Beast should rise To pluck Kings plumes, and peck out Prelates eyes, Teach them to crumble, like a tottring Wall, Or Dagon cripled with a second fall; Or heads on London-bridge, expos'd to sight, That grin, and shew their teeth, but cannot bite: Lastly, when Paul's Cathedral (whose fair growth Attends on thine) is finish'd, when ye both Piercing the Clouds, have kiss'd the Lights above, That by aspiring Towers, thee by Love; When the whole story of thy span is told, And deeds, as well as Bays, have made thee old; When the officious Angels shall have given Thy better part its proper place in Heaven, May thy bright Fame outshine the Morning-star, As Prince, a Prelate, and a Batchelar. So prayeth, Most Honoured Lord, the humblest and meanest of your Lordships Servants, Samuel Speed.</field>
