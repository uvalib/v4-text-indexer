      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. ? Parnassia Laurus Parva sub ingenti Matris se subjicit umbrâ. Virg. TO THE Right Honourable WILLIAM, Lord NORTH and GREY. THE ECLOGUES AND GEORGICKS. VIRGIL's ECLOGUES. PASTORAL the First. Tityrus. Meliboeus, Tityrus. Meliboeus. Beneath the Covert of the spreading Beech Thou, Tityrus, repos'd, art warbling o'er, Upon a slender Reed, thy Silvan Lays: We leave our Country, and sweet native Fields; We fly our Country: Careless in the Shade, Thou teachest, Tityrus, the sounding Groves To echoe beauteous Amaryllis' Name. Tityrus. O Melibœus, 'Twas a God to Us Indulg'd this Freedom: For to Me a God He ever shall be: From my Folds full oft A tender Lamb his Altar shall imbrue: He gave my Heifers, as thou seest, to roam; And Me permitted on my rural Cane To sport at Pleasure, and enjoy my Muse. Meliboeus. Nay, 'Tis not that I envy, but admire; O'er all the Fields such wild Confusion reigns. Lo! I far hence my Goats, just fainting, drive; And This, dear Tityrus, I scarce with pain Can drag along. For here, alas! ev'n now Among thick Hazle-Shrubs she cast her Twins, And left the Hope of all my Herd expos'd On a bare Rock. To me This dire Mishap (For now I recollect, though thoughtless Then) Oaks struck from Heav'n by Lightning oft foretold; And oft ill-boding from a hollow Holm The Raven croak'd. But who should be That God You mention'd, give me, Tityrus, to know. Tityrus. The City, so renown'd, which Rome they call, I, Melibœus, ignorant suppos'd Like This of Ours, whither we Shepherd-Swains (As Custom is) our Lambs to Market drive. So Whelps to Dogs, so Kidlings to their Dams I liken'd; so great Things compar'd with small. But That above all other Citys tow'rs, As the tall Cypress o'er the Under-Grove. Meliboeus. And what the Cause which drew thee Hence to Rome? Tityrus. Freedom: Which came, tho' late; when now in Years, And restive grown, my griesled Chin I shav'd; Yet come it did, tho' after long Delay: E'er since from Galatea I transferr'd My Love to Amaryllis. For, (to Thee I will confess) while Galatea reign'd; No Hope of Freedom, or of Gain I saw: Tho' many a Victim issued from my Folds, And for th'ungrateful Town fat Cheese was press'd; Still Cashless, and Light-handed I return'd. Meliboeus. I marvel'd, Amaryllis, at the Cause, Why Thou, so piteous, didst invoke the Gods; For whom thy Apples on their Branches hung. 'Twas Tityrus was absent from our Fields; Tityrus, of Thy Absence ev'n These Pines, Ev'n These clear Brooks, and ev'n These Woods complain'd. Tityrus. What should I do? No other Way I found To break from Servitude; nor heard elsewhere Of any Gods so present to my Aid. There, Melibœus, That sweet Youth I saw, To whom twelve Days, each Year, my Altars smoke. There to my Suit this Answer first He gave; Swains, Feed, as erst, your Heifers, yoke your Steers. Meliboeus. Happy old Man! Thy Farm shall then remain; And large enough for Thee; tho' all thy Grounds With naked Stones are cover'd, and o'ergrown With muddy Rushes in a marshy Soil. No unaccustom'd Pasturage shall taint Thy pregnant Ewes; nor from a neighb'ring Flock Diseases with contagious Touch consume. Happy old Man! Among the well-known Streams, And sacred Fountains, here the cooling Shade Thou shalt enjoy. The Quick-set Sallows here, Which always part th'adjoining Fields from Thine, Suck'd by Hyblæan Bees, that drink its Flow'rs, Shall oft invite thy Sleep with humming Sound. The Woodman there, beneath a lofty Rock, Shall sing to Heav'n: Nor shall meanwhile the Doves, Thy dear Delight, nor yet the Turtles cease To cooe, and from aëreal Elms complain. Tityrus. Therefore swift Stags shall sooner feed in Air, And Tides leave naked Fishes on the Beach; Sooner shall Parthia and Germania change Their Climate, This drink Tigris, Arar That; Than from my Soul his Image be effac'd. Meliboeus. But we to distant Climes must banish'd go; Some to parch'd Africk's Sands; to Scythia, some; To Crete, and turbulent Oäxes' Stream, And Britain, quite from all the World disjoin'd. Shall I then never more, admiring, see, After long Absence, and some Harvests past, My Country's Coasts, my poor Hut built with Turf, To Me a Kingdom? Shall these Lands, so well Manur'd, by impious Soldiers be possess'd? These Crops by Aliens? See, to what Extremes Our wretched Natives are reduc'd by Broils Intestine! See, for Whom we sow'd our Fields! Go, Melibœus; Graft thy Pear-Trees now; Now range thy Vines in order: Go, my Goats, Once happy Cattle, go: Henceforth no more Shall I, extended in my mossy Cave, Behold you from a Rock o'ergrown with Thorns At distance hang; No Carols shall I chant; Tended by Me no more, my Goats, shall you On Trefoil's Flow'rs, and bitter Sallows browze. Tityrus. Yet Here this Night with Me thou may'st repose, On verdant Leaves: Ripe Apples here I have, Soft Chesnuts, and of well-press'd Cheese good Store; And now the Village-Tops at distance smoke, And longer Shades from lofty Mountains fall. PASTORAL the Second. Corydon. The Shepherd Corydon, with hopeless Fires, For fair Alexis burn'd, his Lord's Delight: Tho' hopeless, yet among the shady Tops Of the thick Beeches day by day he came; There in These undigested Strains, to sooth, Unknowing what he sought, his fond Despair, To Woods and Mountains he complain'd alone. Cruel Alexis! Nought dost thou regard My Verse? Nought pity me? Force me to die? Our Cattle now the cooling Shades enjoy; Now the green Lizards lurk in prickly Brakes: And Thestylis pounds Thyme, and Garlick, Herbs Strong-scented, for the Reapers tir'd with Heat. But while, beneath the scorching Sun, I trace Thy Steps; the Lawns with Grashoppers resound, Which their hoarse Notes in Consort join with mine. Was it not better to endure the Pride Of Amaryllis, or Menalcas' Scorn; Tho' black He was, tho' wondrous fair art Thou? O trust not thy Complexion, beauteous Boy, Too far: White Withbinds fall, black Hyacinths Are gather'd. I, Alexis, am disdain'd By Thee: nor who I am, dost thou enquire; How rich in snow-white Cattle, how in Milk Abounding. On Sicilian Mountains rove A thousand Lambs of mine: In Summer's Heat, And Winter's Frost, new Milk I never want: I sing, as That Dircæan Shepherd sung, Amphion, if he ever fed his Flocks. On high Bœtian Aracynthus' Top. Nor am I so deform'd; I lately saw Myself upon the Shore, when free from Winds The Sea stood smooth: Daphnis I should not fear, Tho' Thou wert Judge, unless that Mirrour lye. O! were but Thy Delight with me to dwell, In lowly Cottages, and rural Shades. By Thee despis'd! to drive the Kids afield With a green Wand, and shoot the flying Deer! Singing in Woods, Thou Pan himself with Me Shalt imitate: Pan taught us first with Wax Reeds to conjoin, and form the various Pipe; O'er Sheep, and o'er their Shepherds Pan presides. Nor with a Reed do thou disdain t'indent Thy tender Lip; to learn this very Art Ambitious, what did not Amyntas do? A Pipe I have, of seven unequal Canes Compacted; which to me Damætas gave, And dying said, Henceforth of this be Thou The second Owner: Thus Damætas said; The Fool Amyntas, vex'd, with Envy pin'd. Besides two young He-Goats, in no safe Vale By me recover'd, with their Skins ev'n now Dapled with White; which I for Thee reserve: Each Day from both her Teats they drain their Dam. Them Thestylis long time has beg'd; and She Shall have them, since my Presents are Thy Scorn. Come hither, beauteous Boy; Behold, the Nymphs To Thee fresh Lilies in full Baskets bring: For Thee the lovely Näis crops the Heads Of Poppies, and the Violet's pale Flow'rs, With the Narcissus, and sweet Anise join'd; Then mingling Cinnamon, and other Herbs Of fragrant Scent, with the soft Hyacinth The Saffron Bloom of Marigolds adorns. Myself will gather Quinces white with Down, And Chesnuts which my Amaryllis lov'd: Plumbs I will add, like Wax, of yellow Hue; And to That Fruit new Honour shall be paid: You too, ye Laurels, and Thee, Myrtle, next; Because thus mix'd you fragrant Odours blend. Thou art a Rustick, Corydon; nor cares Alexis for thy Gifts: Or if in Gifts Thou shouldst contend; Iölas would not yield. Wretch that I am! What would I? To the Winds My Flow'rs I have expos'd, and sent the Swine (Ah! frantick!) to pollute my limpid Streams. Whom fly'st thou, Thoughtless? Gods have liv'd in Woods; And Trojan Paris: In the Tow'rs she built Let Pallas dwell: The Woods be our Delight. The savage Lioness pursues the Wolf; The Wolf the Goat; the Goat the Trefoil's Flow'rs; Thee Corydon, Alexis: All their Love. Behold, the Oxen homewards draw the Plough, Less lab'ring with its Weight; and now the Sun, Retiring, doubles the increasing Shades: Yet Love me burns; What Bounds are set to Love? Ah! Corydon! What Frenzy turns thy Brain? Thy Vine, half-prun'd, creeps round yon leafy Elm: Why rather try'st thou not with Osier Twigs, And Rushes, something for thy Use to weave? Nature has more than one Alexis form'd; Thou'lt find Another, tho' disdain'd by This. PASTORAL the Third. Palæmon. Menalcas, Damætas, Palæmon. Menalcas. Are These, Damætas, Melibœus' Sheep? Damætas. No; Ægon's: Ægon gave them to my Care. Menalcas. O Sheep, still hapless Cattle! While He wooes Neæra, and my Rival Int'rest fears; Twice in each Hour this Hireling milks his Flock, And drains the suckling Ewes, and starves the Lambs. Damætas. Less liberally tho', at least on Men, (Remember That) such Scandal should be thrown: We know by Whom, and in what sacred Cave You too were—While the He-Goats look'd askance: But thank the easy Nymphs; They saw, and smil'd. Menalcas. 'Twas then belike; when Me they saw, for Spight, Bark Mycon's Trees, and cut his tender Vines. Damoetas. Or here, by This old Beech; when Daphnis' Bow And Shafts You broke: Which when thou saw'st (perverse Menalcas) on the harmless Youth bestow'd; With Envy Thou wert stung, and if no way Thou could'st have done him Mischief, would'st have dy'd. Menalcas. If Slaves thus dare; What will their Masters do? Did not I see You, Varlet, by Surprize Filch Damon's Goat, Lycisca barking loud? And when I cry'd, Now whither runs That Thief? Look sharp there, Tityrus, and count thy Flock; You skulk'd behind a Bush, and slunk away. Damoetas. Vanquish'd in Piping, ought he not to yield The Goat which my excelling Reed had won? If yet you know it not, That Goat was Mine: Damon himself confess'd it, own'd the Debt; Only pretended that he could not pay. Menalcas. Thou Him in Piping! Had'st thou e'er a Pipe Jointed with Wax? Wert thou not wont, Thou Dolt, In the Cross-ways, upon a screeching Straw, To murder a vile Tune with viler Notes? Damoetas. Please you to try then what we Both can do? I stake this Heifer; That you mayn't refuse, Two Calves she suckles; twice is milk'd each Day: Name You your Stake, and let the Match begin. Menalcas. Nought from my Flock I dare: At Home I live With a hard Stepdame, and a jealous Sire; Both number o'er the Cattle, One the Kids, Twice ev'ry day. But, what Thyself shalt own Of greater Value, (since thou art resolv'd To be so Mad) two Beechen Bowls I'll lay, The Carv'd-work of divine Alcimedon; Round which the easy Graver has entwin'd An Ivy's Berries, cloath'd with paler Leaves, And mingled with the Tendrils of a Vine: Two Figures in the Midst; Conon, and—Who Was He that with a Wand describ'd the Globe Thro' all it's various Realms: and thro' the Year The Seasons when to reap, and when to plough? New they are kept, and never touch'd my Lips. Damoetas. The same Alcimedon for Me too made A Pair of Bowls, and with soft Foliage wreath'd Their Handles; Orpheus in the Midst he plac'd, Follow'd by list'ning Woods. New they are kept, And never touch'd my Lips. If you regard The Heifer; little Praise the Bowls deserve. Menalcas. Thou shalt not 'scape me so: Where-e'er You lead, I follow; and your own Conditions take. Let but Palæmon (see He comes this way) Hear, and be Judge: I'll teach you to beware, Henceforward, how you challenge Swains to sing. Damoetas. Come on then, if Th'hast aught of Skill; In Me There's no Delay; Nor Any do I shun. Only do Thou This Contest well attend, Neighbour Palæmon; 'Tis no small Concern. Palæmon. Sing then; since on the verdant Turf we sit, And now the Fields all teem, and ev'ry Tree: Now bloom the Groves, now smiles the beauteous Year. Begin, Damœtas; Thou come in by Turns, Menalcas: In alternate Measures sing; Alternate Measures please the Muses best. Damoetas. With Jove, ye Muses, let the Song begin; All Things are full of Jove: He for the World Provides indulgent, and my Verse regards. Menalcas. Me Phœbus loves; His Gifts are still with Me, His sweetly-blushing Hyacinth, and Bays. Damoetas. Young Galatea, wanton Girl, in Sport Pelts me with Apples: To the Willow-Grove Then flys; but wishes not to fly unseen. Menalcas. To Me, unsent for, my Amyntas comes; Nor Delia to our Dogs is better known. Damoetas. For my dear Love my Presents are prepar'd: I've mark'd the Covert where the Stock-Doves build. Menalcas. Ten golden Apples from a Woodland Tree (The best I could) to the dear Youth I sent; To-morrow I will send as many more. Damoetas. O! what to Me did Galatea say! How oft repeat it! Some of Those sweet Words, Ye Winds, waft upwards; that the Gods may hear. Menalcas. What boots it me, Amyntas, that my Love By Thee is not disdain'd; if, while the Boars Thou huntest, I am set to watch the Toyls? Damoetas. Iölas, 'Tis my Birth-day; Phyllis send To Me: and when a Heifer for the Fruits We sacrifice, do Thou thy self assist. Menalcas. Phyllis above all Others is my Love, Iölas: at our Parting, much She wept; And long Adieu, she cry'd, fair Youth, Adieu. Damoetas. By Flocks the Wolf is dreaded; soaking Show'rs By the ripe Harvests; By the Trees the Wind; By Me my Amaryllis' angry Frown. Menalcas. Grateful is Dew to springing Corn; sweet Browze To new-wean'd Kids; the bending Sallow's Leaves To pregnant Ewes; Amyntas sole to Me. Damoetas. Pollio, tho' She be rustick, loves my Muse; Ye Nine, a Heifer for your Reader feed. Menalcas. Pollio himself surprizing Verse indites: Feed the Bull for him, which with pushing Horns Already butts in Air, and spurns the Sand. Damoetas. Who loves Thee, Pollio, may he Thither rise Whither he joys to see Thee ris'n: For Him May Honey flow, and Spices bloom on Thorns. Menalcas. Who hates not Bavius, be he damn'd to love Thy Metre, Mævius: And may That same Wight With harness'd Foxes plough, and milk He-Goats. Damoetas. You, who crop Flow'rs, and Strawb'ries on the Ground, Fly hence, Ye heedless Children; O! beware: A deadly Snake lies lurking in the Grass. Menalcas. Trust not, my Sheep, the faithless Bank too far: Ev'n now the Ram himself just dries his Fleece. Damoetas. Back from the River, Tityrus, remove The feeding Goats: Myself, when 'tis the Time, Will wash them all, plung'd in the limpid Spring. Menalcas. Boys; Fold your Sheep: If Summer dry the Milk, As lately; we shall squeeze the Teat in vain. Damoetas. Alas! How meagre in a fertile Field Is This my Bull! Love, the same Love alike Both to the Herd, and Herdsman fatal proves. Menalcas. That These are lean, Love is not sure the Cause; Yet thro' the Skin their starting Bones appear: Some ill Eye fascinates my tender Lambs. Damoetas. Say Where, and my Apollo Thou shalt be, The Sky in Breadth three Ells, no more, extends. Menalcas. Say, Where grow Flow'rs with Names of Kings inscrib'd: And Phyllis shall be Thine, and Thine alone. Palæmon. 'Tis not in Me This Contest to decide: The Heifer He deserves, and Thou no less; And Whosoe'er, like Both, can sing of Love; It's Fears, when crown'd; It's Torments, when refus'd. Swains, stop your Streams: The Meads have drank their Fill. PASTORAL the Fourth. Pollio. Sicilian Muses, raise a loftier Strain; Not All in Groves, and lowly Shrubs delight: If Woods we sing; so let the Song proceed, That ev'n Those Woods may claim a Consul's Care. The last great Æra, by Cumæan Verse Of old predicted, is at length arriv'd; The mighty Round of Years again revolv'd; The Virgin now, and Saturn's Reign return; And a new Offspring from high Heav'n descends. Thou only, chaste Lucina, aid the Birth Of This auspicious Boy; by whom the Race Of Iron first shall end, and That of Gold Shine on the World: Thy own Apollo reigns. Beneath thy Fasces, Pollio, to adorn Thy Consulship, This Glory of the Age Shall rise; and mighty Months begin to roll. Beneath Thy Sway, the Relicks of our Guilt (If such be still remaining) quite effac'd Shall from all future Terrors free the World. He shall partake the Life of Gods; see Gods And Heroes, and Himself by Them be seen; And with his Father's Vertues rule the Globe, In Peace. To Thee, sweet Infant, shall the Earth, Yield her first Presents, by no Culture forc'd, The wandring Ivy, and soft Violet, The smiling Crocus, and the blushing Rose. The Goats spontaneous homewards shall return, Their Teats with Milk distended; and the Herds Unterrify'd by monstrous Lions, feed. Thy very Cradle with fresh Flow'rs shall spring; The Serpent too shall die; the fraudful Herbs Of noxious Poison wither, and decay; And Syrian Spices bloom o'er all the World. But when the Fame of Heroes thou shalt learn, Read thy Sire's Deeds, and know what Vertue means; Ripe yellow Harvests on the Fields shall wave, The salvage Brambles blush with pendant Grapes, And Honey from hard Oaks in Dew distil. Yet of old Guilt some Footsteps shall remain, Prompting to tempt the Sea with Ships, with Walls Towns to inclose, with Ploughs to vex the Soil: Another Tiphys o'er the Main shall waft The chosen Chiefs, another Argo guide; New warlike Expeditions shall be form'd, And great Achilles sail again for Troy. But when thy Age shall ripen into Man; The Sailor shall renounce the Sea, no Ships Traffick exchange: All Lands shall all things bear. No Glebe shall feel the Harrow's Teeth, no Vine The Pruning-hook; The sturdy Village-Hind Shall then release his Oxen from the Yoke: Nor chang'd by Art shall various Wool belye It's native Colour; But in Pastures green The Ram himself with Purple's glossy Hue, Or Crocus' yellow Teint shall tinge his Fleece; And unforc'd Crimson cloath the feeding Lambs. The Sisters, by th'unmov'd Decree of Fate Concordant, bade These Ages smoothly run. Advance to mighty Honours, O! advance, (The Time now comes) Thou great Increase of Jove, Heav'n's darling. Offspring! See the globous Weight Of Earth, of Heav'n, of Ocean, nod, and shake! See how all Things enjoy the future Age. O! May my Life's last Scene so long endure, So much of Spirit, as to sing Thy Deeds! Not Thracian Orpheus' self should me excel, Nor Linus: Tho' his Mother Him should aid, His Father Him; Calliope inspire Orpheus, Apollo dictate Linus' Verse. Should Pan himself, ev'n tho' Arcadia judg'd, Contend with Me; Pan, tho' Arcadia judg'd, Would yield Himself outsung. Begin, sweet Babe, To know, and own thy Mother with a Smile; Thy Mother ten long Months sick Qualms endur'd: Begin sweet Babe: Unless the Parents smile; Th'ill-omen'd Offspring never is advanc'd To a God's Board, nor to a Goddess' Bed. PASTORAL the Fifth. Daphnis. Menalcas, Mopsus. Menalcas. Why, Mopsus, since we Both are skill'd in Song, In piping Thou, and I in chanting Verse, Sit we not Here, beneath These branching Elms, With which the mingled Hazles blend their Boughs? Mopsus. The Elder Thou, Menalcas; 'Tis but just, I should obey thee: Whether underneath Th'uncertain Shades which with the Zephyrs wave; Or rather in some Grot we sit: Behold How the wild Vine creeps mantling round This Grot, And with thin sprinkled Clusters cloaths it's Sides. Menalcas. Of all the Shepherds, who frequent These Hills, Amyntas only can with Thee contend. Mopsus. And what if He with Phœbus should contend? Menalcas. Begin Thou, Mopsus; if Th'hast aught to sing Of Phyllis' hapless Fires, or Alcon's Praise, Or Codrus resolute to die: Begin; Here's Tityrus shall tend thy feeding Kids. Mopsus. Rather Those Strains, which on a Beech's Bark I lately noted, and alternate sung, Ill try; Then bid Amyntas vie with Me. Menalcas. As the tough Willow to the Olive yields, The Cowslip to the crimson Rose; so much Amyntas, in my Judgment, yields to Thee. Mopsus. Shepherd, no more: We now have reach'd the Cave. Daphnis, snatch'd hence by unrelenting Death, The Nymphs deplor'd: Ye Hazles, and ye Rills, You heard it; Witness, how the Nymphs deplor'd: When, hugging her lov'd Son's lamented Coarse, His Mother blam'd the cruel Gods and Stars. Daphnis, not One at That ill-omen'd Time, Drove his fed Cattle to the cooling Streams: No Steed would taste the Brook, or touch the Grass. Thy Death, the Woods, and desart Mountains tell, Dear Daphnis, ev'n the Libyan Lions mourn'd. Daphnis Armenian Tygers taught to join In Harness; Daphnis taught the Bacchian Dance, And with soft Leaves to wreath the bending Spears. As of the Trees the Glory is the Vine; Grapes of the Vine; of Herds, the Bull; the Corn, Of fertile Fields; so Thou of all the Swains: Ev'n Pales, when the Fates Thee snatch'd away, And ev'n Apollo's self forsook the Fields. Oft in Those Furrows, where plump Wheat we sow'd, Unlucky Darnel, and wild Oats prevail: Instead of the soft Violet, and gay Glossy Narcissus, Thorns, and Thistles rise; And Burs, and prickly Brambles choke the Glebe. Ye Shepherds, Strew the Ground with Flow'rs; O'er shade The Brooks with Boughs: Daphnis Those Rites demands. And raise a Tomb, and on That Tomb inscribe: “Fam'd in These Woods, ev'n to the Starry Sky, “(Daphnis my Name) sweet Shepherd Here I lie; “Fair was my Flock, but much more fair was I. Menalcas. Such, heav'nly Poet, is Thy Verse to Me, As Slumbers to the Weary on the Grass; Such as fresh purling Rills, in Summer's Heat, To thirsty Travellers. Nor by thy Pipe Alone, but by thy Voice thy Master's Skill Is equal'd. Happy Youth! To Him the Next Thou shalt be deem'd. Yet I too in my Turn, Such as they are, My Numbers will repeat; And raise thy Daphnis to the Stars; To Heav'n Daphnis I'll raise: Me too thy Daphnis lov'd. Mopsus. Can aught by Me more highly be esteem'd, Than such a Gift? The Youth deserv'd our Praise; And Stimichon long since has prais'd thy Verse. Menalcas. Daphnis in Glory Heav'ns new Court admires; And sees the Clouds and Stars, beneath his Feet: For This the Woods, and all the Fields rejoice; And Pan, and all the Swains, and Silvan Nymphs. The Wolf against the Folds no wily Plots Now meditates; nor Toyls to catch the Deer Are set: Good Daphnis Peace, and Freedom loves. Now ev'n the unshorn Mountains raise with Joy Their Voices to the Stars: Now ev'n the Rocks And Woods This Verse resound; The God, the God, Menalcas: Be propitious, O! be kind To thy Adorers. See four Altars here; Two for Thee, Daphnis, and for Phœbus two. Each Year two Goblets froathing with new Milk, To Thee I'll offer; two of fattest Oil; And chiefly with much Bacchus cheer the Feast; In Winter, round the Fire; in Summer's Heat, Beneath the Shade; rich Chian Wine I'll pour, Wine rich as Nectar, from capacious Bowls. To me shall Ægon, and Damœtas sing; Alphesibœus, like the Satyrs, dance. These sacred Rites for ever shall be Thine; When solemn Off'rings to the Nymphs we pay, And when we lead the Victim round the Fields. While Boars love Mountains' Tops, while Fish the Streams; While Bees suct Thyme, while Grashoppers the Dew; Thy Honour, Name, and Praise shall ever live: To Bacchus, and to Ceres as the Swains Make annual Vows, such shall they make to Thee; Thou too shalt be invok'd, and hear our Pray'rs. Mopsus. What Recompence to Thee for such a Song Shall I return? For neither does the Breeze Of whisp'ring Zephyr, when it rises fresh, Bless me so much: Nor Waves that beat the Shore; Nor Rivers, which thro' stony Valleys glide. Menalcas. To Thee This slender Reed I first present: This taught me, “Corydon with hopeless Fires, This too, “Damœtas, Melibœus' Sheep? Mopsus. And Thou This Sheephook take; which often begg'd Of Me, Antigenes could never gain; Tho' oft he begg'd, and then too he deserv'd My Friendship. See, Menalcas, how it shines, With even Knots, and polish'd Brass adorn'd. PASTORAL the Sixth. Silenus. First my Thalia in Sicilian Verse Deign'd to disport, nor blush'd to haunt the Groves: When Kings and Arms I sung; Apollo twitch'd My Ear, and warn'd me; Tityrus a Swain Should feed his fattling Lambs, play humbler Notes. Now I (for Others, Varus' will be found To chant Thy Praises, and record Thy Wars) Indulge my slender Reed, and rural Muse. 'Tis by Command I sing: Yet This, ev'n This If any, smit with fond Desire, shall read; Thee, Varus, Thee our Shrubs, and ev'ry Lawn Shall sound; nor any Page please Phœbus more, Than That which shines, inscrib'd with Varus' Name. Say, Muses. Chromis, and Mnasylus saw Stretch'd in his Cave Silenus sleeping lie; His Veins full swoln with yesterday's Debauch, As usual: From his Head at distance fall'n His Garland lay; and, with it's Handle worn, His pond'rous Tankard hung. They (for the Sire Had often with the Promise of a Song Deceiv'd them Both) approach, and bind him fast With Manacles from his own Garland made. Them, unresolv'd, and tim'rous, Ægle joins, Ægle, the fairest Nymph that rules the Streams; And now, ev'n while he sees it, with the Blood Of Mulberries his Brow, and Temples stains. He smiling at their Play; And why These Bonds? Release me, Boys; Suffice it that by You I have been seen: The Song You wish, attend: A Song for You; The Nymph shall in her Turn Be otherwise oblig'd. He Then begins. Then might you see the Fauns, and savage Beasts Dance in just Measures, and the rigid Oaks Bow their stiff Heads: Nor does Parnassus' Top So much rejoice in Phœbus, nor so much Do Thracian Mountains Orpheus' Verse admire. For There he sung, how thro' the mighty Void The Seeds of Earth, and Water, Air, and Fire, Consolidated met; How first from These The Elements, and the World's recent Globe Compounded rose: How then the firmer Soil Grew hard, and in it's Chanel shut the Sea, And by degrees of various Things receiv'd Th'unnumber'd Species: How the Earth admir'd To see the new-born Sun with glory shine; How Show'rs from high-hung Clouds distill'd; When first The Woods began to rise; and thin, dispers'd, The Animals o'er unknown Mountains rov'd. Next Pyrrha's Race he sings, from Stones transform'd, Caucasean Vulturs, and Prometheus Theft, And Saturn's Reign. To These he adds the Brook, O'er which the Sailors on lost Hylas call'd, And ev'ry Shore with Hylas, Hylas, rung. Rasiphae's Passion for the Snow-white Bull He then consoles; Pasiphae, happy Dame, Happy, if Herds of Neat had never been: Ah! wretched Queen! What Frenzy turns thy Brain? The Prætides with fancy'd Lowings fill'd The Pastures; Yet of Them none sought such foul Embraces; tho' they fear'd the Plough, and oft In their smooth Foreheads, dubious, felt for Horns. Ah! wretched Queen! Thou o'er the pathless Hills Art wand'ring: He, his snow-white Side reclin'd On a soft Hyacinth, beneath an Oak O'ershading, ruminates the paler Grass; Or courts some Female of the num'rous Herd: Ye Nymphs, Dictæan Nymphs, beset the Glades, And Passes of the Thickets; Chance may bring His wandring Footsteps obvious to our Sight; Perhaps some Heifers to Gortynian Stalls May lead him, or with verdant Grass entic'd, Or following his own accustom'd Herds. The Virgin, who Hesperian Apples lov'd, He sings the next. Then binds with mossy Bark Young Phaeton's Sisters, and tall Poplars rears. Then Gallus, wand'ring near Permessus' Stream, He sings; How One among the Sacred Nine Conducted him to see th'Aönian Mount; How to the Bard all Phœbus' Quire arose; And how the Shepherd Linus, crown'd with Flow'rs, And bitter Parsley, Thus in Verse divine Address'd him: Take This Pipe, the Muses' Gift, Which to'th'Ascræan Senior erst they gave; With which from Hills the rigid Oaks he drew. With This sing Thou the Birth of Gryneum's Grove, And let no Grove be more Apollo's Pride. Why should I tell how Scylla, Nisus-born, With barking Monsters, round her Waist, inclos'd, Vex'd the Dulichian Ships (so Fame relates) And in the gulphy Ocean, dire to see! With wild Sea-Dogs the trembling Sailors tore? Or how of Tereus' metamorphos'd Form He sung; for Him what Present, what a Feast By vengeful Philomela was prepar'd, With what a Flight he sought the desart Woods, On the same Wings, with which, (ill-fated Change!) He flutter'd round the Palace once his own? All, which of old by singing Phœbus' bless'd, Eurotas heard, and bade its Laurels learn, Silenus sung; The echoing Vales return The Sounds, and beat them backwards to the Stars: 'Till Vesper warn'd to fold, and count, the Flocks; And rose unwelcome on the list'ning Sky. PASTORAL the Seventh. Meliboeus. Meliboeus, Corydon, Thyrsis. Meliboeus. By chance beneath the Covert of an Oak, That whisper'd with the Breezes, Daphnis sate; And Corydon, and Thyrsis to one Place Together drew their Flocks; Thyrsis, his Sheep; His milch Goats, Corydon; Arcadians Both, Both flourishing in Youth, well pair'd to sing, And ready with Each other's Skill to vie. Here my He-Goat, the Father of my Flock, Himself stray'd from me, while a Fence I made To guard my tender Myrtles from the Cold. Daphnis I saw; and soon as He saw Me, Come hither, Melibœus, strait He cry'd; Thy Goat, and Kids are safe; If aught Thou hast Of Leisure, rest a-while beneath This Shade. Hither thy Bullocks thro' the Meads will come To Wat'ring; Mincius here with trembling Reeds Clothes the green Banks, and from a sacred Oak The clustring Bees with pleasing Murmur sound. What should I do? Nor Phyllis was at home, Nor yet Alcippe, to shut up my Lambs New-wean'd: Yet since a mighty Match in Song 'Twixt Corydon, and Thyrsis was propos'd; Their Play to my own Bus'ness I preferr'd: Then in alternate Verse They both began; The Muses dictated alternate Verse: These Corydon recited, Thyrsis Those. Corydon. Ye Nymps, Libethrian Nymphs, my dear Delight; Or give me, like my Codrus, Verse to sing; (He sings the next to Phœbus:) Or if That We cannot All obtain; my tuneful Reed Shall here hang useless on This sacred Pine. Thyrsis. Ye Swains, with Ivy crown your rising Bard; That Codrus' Spleen may burst with envious Spight: Or if he load Him with immod'rate Praise, With Baccar bind his Brows; lest That ill Tongue Should hurt the future Poet's growing Fame. Corydon. This bristly Boar's huge Head, These branching Horns Of the long-living Stag young Mycon vows, Delia, to Thee: If such Success be Mine Perpetual; in smooth Marble Thou shalt stand, Full Length, Thy Legs with purple Buskins bound. Thyrsis. Suffice it Thee, Priapus, to expect Each Year a Pail of Milk, and Cakes like These: A small penurious Garden is Thy Care. In Marble, for the present, Thou must stand; But if the teeming Ewes with Lambs recruit My Flock now lessen'd; Thou shalt shine in Gold. Corydon. Sweet Galatea, Nymph to Me more sweet Than Hybla's Thyme, than Swans more white, more fair Than the pale Ivy; Come, if aught Thou love Thy Corydon, soon as the well-fed Steers Shall from the Pastures to their Stalls return. Thyrsis. And may I, beauteous Maid, to Thee appear More bitter than Sardinian poys'nous Herbs, More rough than Gorse, more vile than with'ring Weeds: If This Day be not longer than a Year To Me: Go home, fed Bullocks, go for Shame. Corydon. Ye mossy Founts, and Grass more soft than Sleep, With the green Arbutus, whose thin-spred Boughs O'ershade you; from the Solstice' burning Heat Defend the Flocks: Now scorching Summer comes, And in the fruitful Tendrils swells the Gems. Thyrsis. Here glows the Hearth, here pitchy Pines, and Fire Abound; Here black with Soot the Lintels smoke. Here Boreas' Cold we just as much regard, As Wolves the Sheep, or torrent Streams the Shore. Corydon. Here Junipers, and husky Chesnuts grow; Beneath each Tree it's Apples strew the Ground: Tho' all things smile; if fair Alexis leave These Hills, You'll see the very Rivers dry. Thyrsis. Scorch'd are the Fields; The Herbage dies with Thirst. Beneath the vicious Air: Illib'ral grown Bacchus denies the Hills his viny Shades: Yet when my Phyllis comes; each Lawn shall smile, And plenteous Jove in fertile Show'rs descend. Corydon. To Hercules the Poplar is most dear; The Vine to Bacchus; To the Cyprian Dame The Myrtle; To Apollo his own Bay: Phyllis the Hazles loves; While Them She loves, Them nought excels the Myrtle, or the Bay. Thyrsis. In Groves the Beech, in Gardens is the Pine Most beautiful; The Poplar near the Streams; On the high Mountains' Tops the stately Fir: Yet, lovely Lycidas, if oft Thou come To visit me; Thou, beauteous, shalt excel The Pine in Gardens, and the Beech in Groves. Meliboeus. This I remember; and that quite outsung Thyrsis in vain contended: From That Time 'Tis Corydon, 'tis Corydon for Me. PASTORAL the Eighth. Pharmaceutria. Damon, Alphesiboeus. Of Damon's, and Alphesibœus' Muse, Contending Swains, Whose Songs the Herds admir'd, Mindless of Pasture; while the list'ning Lynx' Stood motionless, and Rivers stop'd their Course; Of Damon's, and Alphesibœus' Muse The Numbers we repeat. Thou, matchless Chief, Aid my Attempt: Whether Thou pass the Rocks Of wide Timavus' Stream; or coast along Th'Illyrian Shore. Will that Day never come, When 'twill be giv'n me to record Thy Deeds? Will it be never giv'n me to diffuse Thro' all the World Thy Verse, which sole deserves The Sophoclëan Buskin's Fame? With Thee Commenc'd my Labours, and with Thee shall end. Accept These Lays by Thy Command begun; And let this Ivy-Wreath, Thy Temples round, Creep intermingled with Thy conqu'ring Bays. Scarce had the humid Shades of Night retir'd; When to the Cattle on the Grass, the Dew Most grateful rises: Leaning on the Trunk Of a round Olive, Damon Thus began. Damon. Rise, Lucifer, and previous bring the Day; While I, deceiv'd by ill-requited Love Of perjur'd Nisa, pour forth my Complaint; And to the Gods (tho' Me, by Oaths invok'd, They nought avail'd) with my last Breath appeal. Begin with me, my Pipe, Mænalian Strains. On Mænalus a Grove of whisp'ring Pines Still grows; He always hears the Shepherd's Loves, And Pan, who first taught Reeds their tuneful Sound. Begin with me, my Pipe, Mænalian Strains. To Mopsus (What may not We Lovers hope?) Nisa is wedded: Gryffons now shall match With Horses; In the next succeeding Age The tim'rous Deer with Dogs shall drink the Streams. New Torches, Mopsus, cut; Thy Bride comes home: Strew thy Nuts, Bridegroom; Hesper sets for Thee. Begin with me, my Pipe, Mænalian Strains. O! worthily espous'd, disdainful Fair, To a fit Spouse! While Others are Thy Scorn, While hateful are my Flocks, and Pipe to Thee, My shaggy Eyebrows, and my unshorn Beard: Nor think'st Thou Heav'n regards what Mortals do. Begin with me, my Pipe, Mænalian Strains. Thee, with Thy Mother, in our Meads I saw, Gath'ring fresh Apples; I myself your Guide; Then Thou wert little; I, just then advanc'd To my twelfth Year, could barely from the Ground Touch with my reaching Hand the tender Boughs: How did I look! How gaze my Soul away! How did I die! in fatal Error lost! Begin with me, my Pipe, Mænalian Strains. Now what is Love I know: From flinty Rocks Him Ismarus, and Rhodope disclos'd; Or the wild Garamantes bore; a Boy Of Race not Ours, and alien from our Blood. Begin with me, my Pipe, Mænalian Strains. Inhuman Love th'unnat'ral Mother taught To dip her Hands in her own Children's Blood: Cruel indeed the Mother; Was She then More cruel? Or more impious that dire Boy? Impious the Boy, the Mother cruel too. Begin with me, my Pipe, Mænalian Strains. Now let the Sheep pursue the Wolf; hard Oaks Bear golden Apples; on the Alder bloom Narcissus; Tamerisks rich Amber sweat; The Owls in Singing with the Swans contend; Be Tityrus a second Orpheus deem'd, Orpheus in Woods, Arion in the Sea. Begin with me, my Pipe, Mænalian Strains. Let all Things be confus'd; Sea mix with Land: Ye Groves, farewel: From yon aëreal Rock Headlong I'll plunge into the foamy Deep. Take This last Gift which dying I bequeath. Cease now, my Pipe, now cease Mænalian Strains. Thus Damon: What Alphesibœus sung, Ye Muses, say: All things we cannot All. Alphesiboeus. Bring hither Water, bind the Altars round With a soft Fillet; Fertil Vervain burn, And strongest Frankincense: That I may try With sacred Magick Rites to turn the Brain Of Him I love; Nought here, but Charms we want. Bring Daphnis, bring him from the Town, my Charms. Charms ev'n from Heav'n can conjure down the Moon: Circe with Charms Ulysses' Mates transform'd: In Meadows the cold Snake with Charms is burst. Bring Daphnis, bring him from the Town, my Charms. First these three Lists distinct with Colours three Round Thee I bind; Thrice round the Altars lead Thy Image: Heav'n uneven Numbers loves. Bring Daphnis, bring him from the Town, my Charms. Three Colours, Amaryllis, in three Knots Industrious knit; Quick, Amaryllis, quick: Knit them; and say, 'Tis Venus' Knot I tie. Bring Daphnis, bring him from the Town, my Charms. As This Clay hardens, and This Wax grows soft By the same Fire; so Daphnis by my Love. Crumble This Cake; and with Bitumen burn These crackling Bays: Me cruel Daphnis burns; And I on cruel Daphnis burn These Bays. Bring Daphnis, bring him from the Town, my Charms. May Love, like That with which the Heifer raves, When thro' the Thickets, and high Woods, fatigu'd She seeks the Bull, then near a River's Stream Restless lies down, amidst the verdant Sedge, Nor minds at latest Ev'ning to return; May such Love Daphnis seize, nor I take care To ease his Frenzy, or abate his Pain. Bring Daphnis, bring him from the Town, my Charms. These Relicks, these dear Pledges of Himself With me long since the faithless Shepherd left: These now, ev'n in the Entrance, I commit, O Earth, to Thee: Daphnis these Pledges owe. Bring Daphnis, bring him from the Town, my Charms. These Poisons, and These magick Simples, cull'd In Pontus (many such in Pontus grow) Sage Mœris gave me: Oft with These I've seen Mœris into a Wolf himself transform, And howling seek the Woods; oft raise up Ghosts From Graves; and Crops to Fields not theirs transfer. Bring Daphnis, bring him from the Town, my Charms. These Ashes, Amaryllis, forth convey; Throw them into the River, o'er thy Head, And look not back: Daphnis with These I'll try; He nought the Gods, nor aught our Charms regards. Bring Daphnis, bring him from the Town, my Charms Behold, the Ashes, while I thus delay To bear them hence, now lick the Altar round With trembling Flames, spontaneous; May it prove Auspicious: Something sure, I know not What, There is; and Hylax in the Entrance bays. May I believe it? Or do Those who love Dream of the Bliss which fondly they desire? Cease: Daphnis comes from Town; now cease, my Charms. PASTORAL the Ninth. Moeris. Lycidas, Moeris. Lycidas. Whither goes Mœris? What? Next way to Town? Moeris. O Lycidas, We've liv'd so long, to see, What we ne'er fear'd, Things come to such a Pass; That an Intruder at our Farm should cry To the old Farmers, This is Mine, Be gone: Now outed from our Own, in dreary Plight, To Him, since all Things are by Fortune chang'd, These Kidlings (may they choak him) We convey. Lycidas. Why sure I heard, that where the Hills begin To lessen by an easy soft Descent, Down to the Water, and the stunted Beech, Menalcas with his Verse had sav'd it All. Moeris. Thou heard'st it, Lycidas, and so 'twas said: But Verse, in War, has just as much of Pow'r, As Turtles, when the sowsing Eagle comes. But had not, croaking from a hollow Holm, The Raven warn'd me This new Strife to end At any Rate; nor had Thy Mœris here, Nor had Menalcas' self, been now alive. Lycidas. Alas! could Any think so foul a Crime? And was (alas!) our Solace, our Delight With Thee, Menalcas, almost snatch'd away? Who then should sing the Nymphs? Who strew the Ground With Flow'rs? Or with green Boughs the Fountains shade? Or chant Those Lays, which I from Thee of late, In my lov'd Amaryllis' Grot, purloin'd? “Feed, Tityrus, my Goats 'till I return; “'Tis but a little Way; When they are fed, “Drive them to Wat'ring, Tityrus; and while “Thou dost it, 'ware the He-Goat's butting Horn. Moeris. Or rather These, which He to Varus sung Yet uncorrect: “Let Mantua still be Ours, “Mantua (alas for her unhappy Fate!) “Too near Cremona; Be but This bestow'd: “Varus, the singing Swans with tow'ring Flight “Sublime, shall raise Thy Glory to the Stars. Lycidas. So may Thy Swarms avoid Cyrnæan Eughs, So may Thy Kine well fed with Trefoil-Flow'rs Distend their Dugs; If aught Thou hast, begin. Me too the Muses (I too have my Verse) A kind of Rhymer made: Me too the Swains A Poet call; But there my Faith is slow. For nothing can I yet, I think, indite Worthy of Varus', or of Cinna's Ear; But scream, a Goose among the tuneful Swans. Moeris. That, Lycidas, I'm conning in my Mind; And, could I hit it, 'tis no vulgar Verse. “Come hither, Galatea: What Delight “Can the Sea give? Here blooms the purple Spring; “Here various Flow'rs, the winding Rivers round, “The Earth pours forth; Here the pale Poplar hangs “O'er our cool Grot; and intermingled Vines “With pliant Tendrils weave a gentle Shade. “Come hither; Let the mad Waves beat the Shore. Lycidas. And what are Those, which once I heard thee sing In a clear Night alone? The Tune I well Remember; could I recollect the Words. Moeris. “Daphnis, The Rising of the ancient Signs “Why dost thou still admire? Behold, the Star “Of Dionæan Cæsar rolls along; “A Star, by which the Fields shall laugh with Corn, “And on warm Hills the purple Clusters swell. “Daphnis, inoculate thy Pear-Trees now, “And late Posterity shall crop Thy Fruit. Age all Things, ev'n the Mind itself, impairs. Oft, I remember, when a Boy, I sung, Whole Summers' Days, the Sun quite down the Sky: So many Verses now to Me are lost; Mœris ev'n of his Voice is now bereft: Wolves have seen Mœris, e'er Themselves were seen. But oft to Thee Menalcas' self shall sing. Lycidas. By These Excuses, and This long Delay, Thou dost but whet my Appetite the more. And now behold the Sea lies smooth, and all The Blasts of murm'ring Winds are hush'd in Peace. From hence too 'tis no more than Half our Way; For see, Bianor's Tomb begins to rise. Here, where the Shepherds strip the Leaves from Boughs, Here, Mœris, let us sing; Here lay thy Kids: Yet we shall reach the Town: Or, if before We reach it, Night we fear, and gath'ring Rain; Yet singing let us go: our Walk will less Fatiguing prove: That singing we may go, I'll ease thy Shoulders, and This Burthen bear. Moeris. Shepherd, no more; Mind we our present Charge: We shall sing better, when Himself arrives. PASTORAL the Tenth. Gallus. Indulge me, Arethusa, This my Last Of Labours: To my Gallus must be paid Some Verse, which ev'n Lycoris may peruse: What Bard to Gallus can a Verse deny? So while Thou glid'st beneath Sicanian Waves, May brackish Doris never mix with Thine. Begin; and while the Goats the Thickets browze, Let us relate how Gallus pin'd with Love. Nor sing we to the Deaf; The Woods reply. What Groves, ye Nymphs, detain'd you hence? What Lawns? When Gallus dy'd of Love's tormenting Wound? For 'twas not Cynthus' nor Parnassus' Top, Nor yet Aonian Aganippe's Stream. Him lonely, stretch'd beneath a desart Rock, Ev'n the low Shrubs, and ev'n the Laurels mourn'd; Him piny Mænalus, and the tall Cliffs Of bleak Lycæus. Round him stood the Sheep; For they too sympathize with human Woe: Them, Heav'nly Poet, blush not Thou to own: Ev'n fair Adonis, did not scorn to tend Along the River's side, his fleecy Charge. To Him the slow-pac'd Herdsmen, and the Swains, And wet with Winter-Mast Menalcas came; All ask, Whence This thy Love? Apollo came; Gallus, What Frenzy This? Thy Care Lycoris Follows Another, thro' rough Camps, and Snows. Sylvanus came, with rural Honours crown'd, Boughs, and big Lilies nodding round his Head. Pan came, th'Arcadian God, whom We ourselves Have seen, with red Vermilion, and the Blood Of Elder-berries stain'd: Where will This end? He said; Love heeds it not: Nor Meads with Streams Are satisfy'd, nor Goats with Browze, nor Bees With Trefoil-Flow'rs, nor cruel Love with Tears. But pensive He: Yet You these Tears shall sing, Arcadians, on your Hills; ye only skill'd In Song: O! softly then my Bones shall rest, If You in future times shall sing my Loves. O! had kind Fortune made me one of You, Keeper of Flocks, or Pruner of the Vine: Were Phyllis, or Amyntas my Desire, Or any Other; (and what Fault, tho' black Amyntas be? Violets, and Hyacinths Are black:) Sure either would with Me repose, Amidst the Willows, under the soft Vine, Phyllis weave Garlands, and Amyntas sing. See, here, cool Springs, Lycoris, Meads, and Groves; Here I could melt all Life away with Thee. Now frantick Love amidst thick Darts and Foes Detains me in the rigid Toil of Arms. While Thou (but can I yet believe 'tis so?) Far from thy native Soil art wand'ring o'er The Alpine Snows, or near the frozen Rhine, Ah! cruel! Not with me. Ah! how I fear Lest the sharp Cold should pierce thee, or the Ice On the rough Mountains cut thy tender Feet. I'll go, and sing my Chalcis' Strains, compos'd To the Sicilian Shepherd's tuneful Reed: It is resolv'd; To Wilds, and Dens of Beasts I'll fly, and any Pain, but This, endure; On the Trees' tender Bark inscribe my Love, And with the growing Bark my Love shall grow. Meanwhile among the Woodland Nymphs I'll rove O'er Mænalus, or hunt the foaming Boar; In spight of Frosts-Parthenian Thickets round I'll pitch my Toyls; Now, now, methinks I go O'er Rocks, thro' sounding Woods, shoot Cretian Shafts, And twang the Parthian Horn: As if Those Sports Could prove a Med'cine to my frantick Pain, Or Love could learn to pity human Woes. And now again the Nymphs can please no more; Nor ev'n my Verse; Ev'n You, ye Groves, farewel. No Toils of Ours the cruel God can change; Whether we drink of Hebrus' frozen Stream, And rainy Winter, and Sithonian Snows. Endure; or, when the dying Bark is scorch'd Round the tall Elm, we tend our Flocks beneath The Tropick of the Ethiopian Crab: Love conquers All, and We must yield to Love. Thus much, Ye Muses, has your Poet sung, (Let This suffice) while underneath a Shade He sate, and Baskets with smooth Osiers wove. You shall for Gallus dignify This Verse; Gallus, for whom my Friendship grows each Hour, As the green Alder, when the Spring returns. Rise we; The Shade is noxious, while we sing: Noxious, if we delay, is ev'n the Shade Of Juniper: The Shade too hurts the Fruit: Go, my fed Goats; The Ev'ning comes; Go home. The End of the Pastorals. VIRGIL's GEORGICKS. BOOK the First. What makes the Fields rejoice; beneath what Stars To turn the Glebe; and Vines adjoin to Elms, Mæcenas; what the Care of lowing Herds; The Culture apt for Cattle; and how great Th'Experience of the parsimonious Bee; I here attempt to sing. Ye brightest Lamps Of Heav'n, who with your Influence cheer the World, And thro' the Sky roll round the sliding Year; Liber, and foodful Ceres: If the Earth By your Indulgence chang'd Chaönian Mast For Corn, and from the new-discover'd Grape With Achelöian Bev'rage mingled Wine; And You, propitious Rural Deitys, Ye Fauns, and Silvan Nymphs assist my Verse: Your Gifts I sing. And Thou, at whose Command The Parent Earth a sprightly Steed disclos'd, Struck with thy awful Trident, Neptune, hear; Thou too, for whom in fertil Cæa's Woods, Three hundred snow-white Steers the Bushes browze; Thyself, Protector of the fleecy Flocks, (If aught thy Mænalus employ thy Care) Tegeæan Pan, be present to my Song, And leave a-while thy own Lycæus' Groves. Thou too, Producer of the Olive-Plant, Minerva; with the Youth who shew'd Mankind The first Invention of the crooked Plough; And Thou, Sylvanus, bearing in thy Hand A sapling Cypress from its Roots up-torn. And all ye Gods, and Goddesses, who tend The Fields, and studious o'er their Fruits preside; You, who perpetuate them with Seed; and You, Who with large Show'rs refresh That Seed from Heav'n. And Thou, the Chief, whose Seat among the Gods Is yet uncertain; Whether o'er the Earth, Cæsar, thy Deity shall chuse to reign, And o'er it's Cities; while the spacious Globe Shall Thee acknowledge Donor of it's Food, And Sov'reign of the Seasons, and thy Head With thy celestial Mother's Myrtle bind. Or whether thy Divinity shall rule The boundless Deep; the Mariners thy Aid Alone invoke; extremest Thulè own Thy Sway; while Tethys sues to call thee Son, And offers all her Ocean's Waves in Dow'r. Or whether to the tardy Months thou add Another Constellation; where a Space Between Erigone, and Scorpio's Arms Is vacant: See! the burning Scorpion Now, Ev'n Now, contracts his Claws, and leaves for Thee A more than just Proportion of the Sky. Whate'er Thou chuse to be; (for let not Hell Hope to enjoy Thy Reign, nor let so dire A Love of Empire harbour in Thy Breast; Tho' fondly Greece admires th'Elysian Fields, Nor cares Proserpina to reascend Following her Mother:) To my Verse indulge A smooth Carrier, and aid my bold Design; And pitying, with Me, the simple Swains Unknowing of their Way, ev'n now invok'd, Practise the God, and learn to hear our Pray'rs. With Spring's first Op'ning, when dissolving Snows From hoary Mountains run, and Zephyr slacks The crumbling Glebe; ev'n Then my Steers and Plough In the deep Furrow shall begin to groan, And the sleek Share to glitter from the Toil. That Tilth at last rewards the greedy Hind, And answers all his Hopes, which twice has felt The Sun, and twice the Frost: By This Manure Harvests immense shall burst his crouded Barns. But e'er our Coulter cut the untry'd Mold; The Winds, and various Temper of the Sky, Each Region's Genius, and peculiar Taste, And what by each is born, and what refus'd, Be it our Care to learn. Here Corn, there Grapes More happy grow; Elsewhere, Fruit-Trees, and Grass- Unbidden. Scest thou not how Tmolus sends It's Saffron Odours? India, Ivory? The soft Sabaans, aromatick Sweets? The naked Chalybes, their Iron Ore? Pontus, it's Castor's Drug? Epirus, Steeds Born for the Glory of th'Eleian Palm? These Laws eternal, these Conditions fix'd Nature on ev'ry diff'rent Clime impos'd; What time Deucalion thro' th'unpeopled World First Stones behind him threw: Whence Human Race A hardy Species was restor'd. Observe This Precept then; and in the early Spring Let thy strong Oxen turn the richer Soil; And dusty Summer with maturest Suns Bake the inverted Clods. But if the Land Prove light, and steril; with Arcturus' Star Appearing, 'twill suffice thee to imprint A thinner Furrow. There, lest Weeds molest The sturdy Grain: Here, lest the little Moisture Exhaling should desert the barren Sand. Alternate too thou shalt permit to rest The late-shorn Fallows, and the idle Mold To harden, and with Scurff be overgrown: Or, with the Season chang'd, thou There shalt sow The yellow Wheat; first having thence remov'd The rank luxuriant Pulse, with trembling Pods, Or the thin Vetches, and the brittle Stalks Of bitter Lupines, and the russling Grove. For Flax, and Oats, and Poppies steep'd in Dew Of drowsy Lethe dry th'exhausted Fields. Yet easy will th'alternate Labour prove: Only disdain not Thou with fatt'ning Dung To feed th'impov'rish'd Mold, nor yet to spread Unsightly Ashes o'er the heartless Glebe. So with a Change of Grain the Land will rest: Nor nought th'Advantage of a fallow Soil. Oft too it has been gainful found to burn The barren Fields with Stubble's crackling Flames. Whether from thence they secret Strength receive, And richer Nutriment: Or by the Fire All latent Mischief, and redundant Juice Oozing sweats off: Or whether the same Heat Opens the hidden Pores, that new Supplies Of Moisture may refresh the recent Blades: Or hardens more, and with astringent force Closes the gaping Veins; lest drisling Show'rs Should soke too deep, or the Sun's parching Rays, Or Boreas' piercing Cold should dry the Glebe. Much too He helps his Tilth, who with the Rake Breaks the hard lumpish Clods, and o'er them draws The osier Harrow; nor his Toils in vain Does yellow Ceres from high Heav'n regard. And He, who having turn'd the Soil, again Cuts thro' the Ridges with the Share athwart Directed; with repeated Labour plies The Ground industrious, and commands his Fields. For show'ry Summers, and for Winter's Suns, Ye Farmers, pray: In Winter's Dust the Corn, And Fields rejoice: In no Manure so proud Does Mysia glory; nor for aught so much Does Gargarus it's plenteous Crops admire. What should I say of Him; who, having sown His Grain, with ceaseless Industry proceeds, And spreads abroad the Heaps of barren Sand? Then to the springing Blades sequacious Rills Entices? and, when with'ring Herbs betray The Soil adust, from some steep Mountain's Brow In Gutters Water draws? That gurgling falls, With gentle Murmur, down the slipp'ry Stones; And with it's Streams relieves the thirsty Mold. Or what of Him; who, lest the Stalks, o'ercharg'd By the plump Ears, should sink beneath their Weight, Crops their Luxuriance in the tender Blade, When first their Tops ev'n with the Furrows rise? Or last of Him; who from the soaking Sand The stagnating collected Puddle drains? Chiefly, when Rivers, in th'uncertain Months, Swell o'er their Banks; and all the Country round Cover the Soil with slimy Mud; from whence The hollow Dykes with tepid Moisture sweat. Nor nought, besides, (tho' all Those other Ills In Tillage are by lab'ring Hinds and Steers Experienc'd) does the guilty Goose offend; Strymonian Cranes; and Endive's bitter Root; And nocent Shade. The Sire of Gods himself Will'd not that Tillage should be free from Toil. He first sollicited the restive Mold By Art; and whetted mortal Wit with Cares, Permitting not his Reign to rust with Sloth. E'er Jove was King, no Hinds subdued the Glebe: Nor lawful was it held to sever Lands, Or mark their Bounds: In Common all things lay; And Earth without Compulsion yielded Food. He baneful Poyson to fell Serpents gave; Commanded Wolves to proul, the Sea to toss, From Trees the Honey shook, conceal'd the Fire: And all in Streams repress'd the running Wine. That Want by Thought might strike out various Arts, Gradual; in Furrows seek the Blade of Corn; And by Collision from the Veins of Flint Extund the latent Fire. Then Rivers first Felt hollow'd Timber: The Sea-firing Crew Then first gave Names, and Numbers to the Stars, The Pleiads, Hyads, and the Northern Bear. 'Twas then invented to intangle Beasts In Toyls, and Fowl with Bird-lime to deceive; And with stanch Hounds the Thickets to inclose. One with his Casting-Net, launch'd on the Deep, Beats the broad River: From the deeper Sea Another drags along his dropping Twine. Then rigid Iron, and the grating Saw, With Wedges, first, the splitting Wood they riv'd) Then various Arts ensued. All things give way To pressing Penury, and ceaseless Toll. 'Twas Ceres first taught Mortals with the Share To cut the Ground; when now the sacred Grove For human use no longer yielded Mast, Nor Cherries; and Dodona Food deny'd. Soon after, to the Corn new Labours rose: That noxious Mildew's Rust should eat the Stalks; And idle spiky Thistles croud the Fields. The full Grain dies; a prickly Grove succeeds, And Burrs, and Tares; and thro' the fertil Lands Unlucky Darnel, and wild Oats prevail. Unless then with assiduous Rakes thou work The Ground, and chase the Birds with scaring Noise; And with the crooked Pruner lop the Shades Of spreading Trees, and pray to Heav'n for Show'rs; Another's Store, in vain, alas! admir'd, Thou shalt behold; and from a shaken Oak Thy hungry Appetite in Woods relieve. The Instruments by hardy Rusticks us'd We next must tell; without whose Use no Seed Can spring, nor Harvest ripen. First the Share, And heavy Timber of the crooked Plough: And Ceres' slowly-rolling Car; and Sleds; And Flails; and Harrows of unwieldy Weight; Osiers, and Hurdles; homely Implements Of Celeus; and Iäechus' mystic Van. All which with long Fore-Thought thou shalt provide; If rural Glory, from the Art divine Of Tillage, justly wait thee. In the Woods The pliant Elm with mighty Strength is bent, And takes the Figure of the winding Plough. To it's Extremity the Beam is join'd, Eight Feet in length: two Ears, and Dentails broad: (But the light Linden first, and lofty Beech Are hewn to form the Yoke:) And the Plough-Tail, By which, behind, the Wheels depress'd are turn'd This Way, or that: And Smoke explores the Wood In Chimneys hung. Of antient Rules like these, Many I can recite; if you attend Patient, and deign to learn these little Cares. Chiefly, consolidate with binding Chalk The Threshing-Floor; and knead it with your Hand, And smooth it with the huge Cylindrick Stone: Lest Grass spring up, lest vitiated with Dust, It chap in Chinks: then various Vermin breed Noxious to Farmers. Oft the tiny Mouse Nests under Ground, and stores her Granaries: Or eyeless delving Moles their Mansions dig: And Toads in Cranies found: And num'rous Pests Which Earth produces: The high Stacks of Corn Are wasted by the Weevil; and the Ant In time providing for the Wants of Age. Observe too, when in Woods the Almond tall Blossoms with Flow'rs, and bends its smelling Boughs: If Fruit prevail, the same thy Crop will prove, And mighty Store the Thresher's Sweat reward. But if by Leaves luxuriant Shade abound; Thy Flail shall beat thin Chaff and Straw in vain. Many I've known to medicate their Seed, In Nitre steep'd, and the black Lees of Oil; That in the Bean's fallacious Shell, the Grain Might bigger grow: And tho' o'er mod'rate Fire Moist, and precipitated, and with Pain Long try'd and chosen, oft they have been prov'd Degenerate, in Spight of so much Care; Unless by human Industry and Art The largest, one by one, have from the rest Yearly been cull'd. So all things to the Worse By Fate still backwards run: Like him who stems The Tide adverse; if chance he slack his Arms, Down the prone Stream his Sculler whirls away. Besides; not less by Us must be observ'd Arcturus' Stars, the rising Kids, and Snake Celestial: than by Those who homewards bound Sail the tempestuous Ocean, and the Straits Of Oyster-breeding Hellespont explore. When Libra weighs the Hours of Day, and Sleep, Equal, and parts the Globe 'twixt Light and Shade; Then work your Steers, Ye Hinds, sow Barley's Grain, 'Till sleety Winter tow'rds it's Period tends. Flax too, and Cerealian Poppey's Seed 'Tis time to hide in Furrows, and to urge The Ploughman's Labour; while the drier Soil Permits, and Clouds hang hov'ring in the Sky. Sow Beans in Spring; then too the crumbling Glebe Receives thee, Median Flow'r; and th'annual Toil For Millet comes: when now with golden Horns The shining Bull unlocks the op'ning Year; And, setting, to the Ship the Dog gives Way. But if for Wheat, and Bread-Corn's sturdy Sheaves Thou till, industrious for That Crop alone; First let the Morning Pleiades forsake Th'Horizon, and the Starry Gnossian Crown From the Sun's Rays emerge; before the Seed To Furrows thou commit, or trust the Earth Unwilling with the Promise of the Year. Many e'er Maia's Setting, have begun: But them th'expected Harvest has deceiv'd. If Vetches, and the hungry Pulse thou sow, And think Ægyptian Lentils worth thy Care; Signs not obscure Böotes sinking gives: Begin, and to the middle Frosts proceed. For Purposes like these, the golden Sun Thro' twice six Constellations rules the World, Sever'd by equal Parts. Five Zones divide The Heav'ns; Of which One red with Solar Fire For ever burns; Two (one on either Hand, And in the Globe's Extreme) round this are drawn, Stiff with green Ice, and black with low'ring Clouds: 'Twixt These, and That which fills the middle Space, Two by th'Indulgence of the Gods were giv'n To weary Mortals; and between them Both A Way describ'd, thro' which in Course oblique The glittering Order of the Signs might roll. As tow'rds bleak Scythia, and Riphæan Hills, The Globe is elevated; just so much Depress'd to Libya, South, it downward tends. This Pole to Us is still sublime; but That Black Styx, and the Tartarean Manes see Beneath their Feet. Here huge with sinuous Fold The Snake twines round, and like a River flows 'Twixt the two Bears; the Bears that dread to tinge Themselves in Ocean. There, as 'tis believ'd, Eternal Dead of Night in Silence reigns; Or to That Clime from Us Aurora's Car Brings back returning Day; and when the Sun On Us breaths, Orient, with his panting Steeds, There Vesper reddens late, and lights the Stars. From hence in doubtful Air we may foretel The Weather; hence the Times to reap, and sow: And when 'tis fit to sweep the faithless Sea With Oars; and when to launch our armed Fleets; Or when in Woods to fell the season'd Pine. Nor is it vain that we with Care observe The Stars, the rising and the setting Signs, And by four Seasons the distinguish'd Year. When the cold Rain confines the Farmer Home; At Leisure various Things he may provide, Which should be hasten'd, were the Sky serene. He sharpens his blunt Share; scoops Boats from Trees; Or marks his Cattle, or his Sacks of Corn. Some point their Stakes, and double-spiky Prongs; And Osiers twist to bind the flexile Vine: Now Wicker-Baskets with light Rods they weave: Now parch Your Grain, now grind it in the Mill. Some Labours ev'n on sacred Days the Laws Indulge us: No Religion e'er forbade To drain the Fields; to hedge the Corn around; Brambles to burn; or Snares to lay for Birds; Or plunge the bleating Flocks in healthful Streams. Oft too the Driver of the sluggish Ass, With Oil, or viler Apples loads his Ribs; Or, from the Town returning, with him brings A dented Milstone, or a Mass of Pitch. The Moon herself has certain Days ordain'd Happy of Toils, in certain Order rang'd. Avoid the Fifth: Then gloomy Dis was born, And all the Furies: then the Parent Earth, Teeming with Monsters, to the Light disclos'd Cœus, Iäpetus, Typhœus dire, Those rebel Brothers leagu'd to rend the Sky. Thrice they assay'd on Peliön to heave Ossa: on Ossa still more high to roll Woody Olympus: thrice the Sire of Gods Lanc'd the red Bolt, and hurl'd the Mountains down. Next to the Tenth the Seventh is happy prov'd, To plant the Vine; to break the new-yok'd Steers; And add the Woof to Looms. The Ninth to Flight Is found propitious, but adverse to Theft. In humid Night Things not a few succeed More prosp'rous; Or when Morn bedews the Ground, With the first rising Sun. Stubble by Night, And the dry Meadow's Grass is better mow'd: Moisture by Night is never known to fail. One watches late by Light of Winter Fires; And with the sharpen'd Steel for Torches splits The spiky Wood: Meanwhile his Spouse with Songs Relieves her tedious Toil, and thro' the Web Along the Loom her whistling Shuttle whirls; Or of sweet Must boils down the luscious Juice; And skims with Leaves the trembling Cauldron's Flood. But the strong yellow Corn in Mid-Day's Heat Is reap'd; in Mid-Day's Heat the Threshing-Floor Groans with the Flail, that beats the roasted Grain. Plough naked; naked sow; The lazy Hinds With the Earth in Winter rest: That Time they pass In mutual Feasting, and enjoy their Store: The genial Season to those Feasts invites The jolly Farmers, and dispels their Cares. As when the laden Vessels touch the Port; The jovial Crew with Garlands crown their Sterns. Yet then too is the Time to strip the Oil From Olives; Mast from Oaks; from Myrtle and Bay The bloody-colour'd Berries: then to set Springes for Cranes, and Toyls for Stags; to hunt The Hare; and from the Balearian Sling With twisted Thong whirl'd round to shoot the Doe. While Snow lies deep; while heavy Cakes of Ice, Push'd by the Tide, down the dull Rivers float. Autumnal Tempests, and uncertain Stars, Why should I tell? And what by Hinds with Care Must be provided; when the Day contracts, And Summer softens? Or when show'ry Spring Hastes to it's Period; when the trembling Ears Wave with the Wind; and now the growing Grain On the green Stalk with milky Moisture swells? Oft have I seen, when now the Farmer brought The Reaper to his yellow Fields, and bound His Sheaves with brittle Straw, the warring Winds All rise at once, and from the Roots uprend His full-ear'd Corn, and whirl it high in Air. With such a Gust a Hurricane would drive Light, flying Stubble. Oft too Floods immense Of Waters gush from Heav'n; and gather'd Clouds Brew the black Storm aloft, with dusky Show'rs: The rushing Sky descends, and with vast Rain Drowns the rich Crop, and Labours of the Plough. The hollow Dykes are fill'd: With roaring Noise The foaming Rivers swell; and in the Friths Toss'd by the Wind the wintry Ocean boils. Great Jove himself, amidst the Night of Clouds, Hurls with his red Right-hand the forky Fire: Earth trembles; savage Beasts to Coverts fly; And Mortals' Hearts o'er all the World with Dread Sink shudd'ring, and appall'd. He with his Bolts Or Thracian Rhodope, or Athos strikes, Or high Ceraunia: With redoubled Force The Winds condense the Tempest: Woods roar loud With struggling Blasts; and Rivers lash their Shores. Thou fearing This, observe the Months, and Stars; Whither cold Saturn's Planet wheels it's Course; And thro' what Orbs of Heav'n Cyllenius roves. Chiefly adore, and supplicate the Gods; And annual Off'rings to great Ceres bring, On the green Turf performing sacred Rites; When Winter ends, and Spring now smiles serene. Then Lambs are fat; and Wines most soft; Then Sleep Most sweet; Then leafy Trees the Mountains shade. Ceres let all thy Rustick Youth adore; For Her do Thou with Honey mingle Milk, And gentle Wine: And round the recent Grain Let the propitious Victim thrice be led: Her in full Chorus let the Peasants all Singing attend, and with loud Shouts invite Ceres beneath their Roofs: Nor Any thrust His Sickle to the Corn; 'till wreath'd with Oak To Ceres he has paid the Honours due, With uncouth Dances, and unpolish'd Verse. That we by sure Prognosticks might foreknow The Heats, the Rains, and Cold-producing Winds; What by the Monthly Moon should be advis'd, Great Jove himself ordain'd: Beneath what Star Auster's rough Blasts should fall; and what the Swains Observing, should near Home their Flocks confine. When Winds are rising, strait the tossing Sea Begins to swell; Or a dry crashing Noise Is in the Mountains heard; Or more confus'd The distant Shores, and murm'ring Woods resound. With difficulty Then the Billows spare The crooked Ships; when flying nearer Land The swift-wing'd Cormorants forsake the Deep, And send their Screams before them to the Beach. And when the Sea-Gulls sport upon the Sand; And when, deserting her accustom'd Ponds, The tow'ring Hern soars high above the Clouds. Oft too, when Wind impends, you shall behold Stars glide from Heav'n; long Streaks of Fire, behind, Stream thro nocturnal Shades; Light Chaff, and Leaves Fall'n from the Trees, in Eddies whirl around; Or Feathers on the Water's Surface play. But from the Quarter of the boist'rous North When Lightnings flash; and from the East and West The grumbling Thunder rolls: Then all with Rain The Country swims; and Floods in Ditches swell: Then ev'ry Mariner, sea-faring, furls His humid Sails: None e'er have aught, unwarn'd, Suffer'd from Show'rs. Or them aëreal Cranes Fled, rising from the Vales: Or, tossing high Her Head in Air, the Heifer snuff'd the Storm In her broad Nostrils: Or with flutt'ring Wings The prattling Swallow skim'd the liquid Lakes: Or Frogs in Mud their antient Plaints renew'd. Oft from her secret Cell the painful Ant, Marking a narrow Path, brings forth her Eggs: The show'ry Bow drinks deep: And Flocks of Crows With mingled Clang their clatt'ring Pinions shake, Return'd from Feeding. Now the various Birds, Which haunt the Sea, and Those which range around Asia's soft Meads, and lov'd Cäyster's Lakes, You shall behold in emulation toss Large Water on their Wings, now plunge their Heads Beneath the Waves, now run into the Stream, And, sporting, strive to wash their Plumes in vain. Th'unlucky Raven with full Throat invites The Rain; and in her solitary Walk Alone expatiates on the harden'd Sand. Nor do the Damsels, who industrious ply Their nightly Spinning, not foreknow These Storms: When in their Potsherd-Lamp they see the Oil Sputter in Sparks, and fungous Clots adhere. Nor less Serenity succeeding Show'rs, And sunny Skies, by sure unfailing Signs Thou may'st foretel. For then with keener Edge The Stars shine brillant: Rises bright the Moon, As nought indebted to her Brother's Beams. No thin light Clouds, like Flakes of fleecy Wool, Fly thro' the Air: Nor to the tepid Sun Do Halycons, lov'd by Thetis, stretch their Wings Along the Shore: Nor sordid Swine delight With their foul Snouts to toss the bundled Straw. But lower, near to Earth the Mists descend, Incumbent on the Fields: And now the Bird Of Night, observant of the setting Sun, Sings her late Song from some high Tow'r in vain. Nisus appears sublime in liquid Air; And Scylla rues the ravish'd purple Hair. Where-e'er She flying cuts the yielding Sky, Lo! fierce, revengeful, with a mighty Noise Nisus pursues; where-e'er fierce Nisus wheels, She swiftly flying cuts the yielding Sky. With Thoughts compress'd the Crows their clearer Notes Thrice, and four times repeat; and, in their Nests High tow'ring, with I know not what Delight Unusual fill'd, their mutual Joy express, And caw among the Leaves: The Storms now past, To their lov'd Homes with pleasure they return, Shake their glad Wings, and feed their callow Young. Not that I think an Ingeny Divine To them is giv'n, or Prescience of Events In Fate superior: But when changeful Winds Alter the various Temper of the Sky; And the moist Æther what before was dense Relaxes, and condenses what was rare: The shifting Phantasms of their Minds are turn'd; And now within their Breasts new Passions move, Diff'rent from Those they felt, when driving Blasts Dispers'd the Clouds: Hence That Concent of Birds Chirping in Chorus; Hence the Joy of Beasts; And Flocks of Crows exulting in the Fields. But if the rapid Sun thou shalt regard, And the just Order of succeeding Moons: Thou ne'er shalt by To-morrow be deceiv'd, Nor aught from faithless Starry Nights endure. If, when the Moon collects returning Light, Her blunted Horns include a dusky Air; Then mighty Rain impends o'er Land and Sea. But if a Virgin Blush be o'er her Face Diffus'd; 'Twill then be Wind: With Blasts of Wind Still golden Phœbe reddens. But if bright At her Fourth Rising (for the Fourth predicts Most certainly) and with sharpen'd Horns she wheel Along the Sky; Then all That Day, and Those Succeeding, 'till the Month completed ends, Nor Rain, nor Winds shall know: And on the Shore The Mariners shall for their Safety pay Their Vows to Melicertes, Ino-born, And Panope, and Glaucus, Ocean-Gods. Nor less the Sun, when rising in the East, And when descending to the Western Waves, Will Tokens give; The Sun sure Signs attend, Both in the op'ning Morn, and Starry Eve. When, rising in a Cloud, his Face with Spots He varies, and with half his Orb retires; Be Show'rs suspected: Notus from above Threatens, to Trees, and Flocks, and Corn adverse. Or when among dark Mists, at Dawn of Day, The breaking Rays stream diverse; or with faint Pale Aspect, from Tithonus' Saffron Bed Aurora rises; then alas! the Leaves Shall ill defend the rip'ning Grapes: so thick Dire Hail shall dance, and rattle on the Tiles. These Tokens too, when now he leaves the Sky, 'Twill more import to learn: For oft we see How various Colours wander o'er his Face; The livid, Rain foretels; The fiery, Winds: But with the glowing Red if Spots begin To mingle; all things then with Winds and Rain Confus'd thou shalt behold: Ah! then let None Persuade me ill-advis'd to tempt the Deep, And loose my Cable from the safer Shore. But if at both the Dawn, and Close of Day, His Globe be lucid; Vain shall prove thy Fears Of Tempests; and the Woods thou shalt behold With the clear Northern Blasts serenely wave. In fine; What Vesper's Ev'ning Planet brings, From whence the Wind dispels the drier Clouds, What humid Auster meditates, the Sun Will best advise. The Sun who dares pronounce Erroneous? He too oft foretels the Storms Of Tumults, Treasons, and approaching Wars. He too, at Cæsar's Murder, pitying Rome, With dusky Scurf obscur'd his beamy Head; And impious Mortals fear'd eternal Night. Tho' at that Time Earth too, and spacious Seas, And Dogs obscene, and ill-presaging Birds Gave dire Portents. How oft have we beheld Loud thund'ring Ætna from Volcanos burst, Deluge with liquid Fire Cyclopean Fields, And toss huge Balls of Flame, and molten Stones? O'er all the Sky Germania heard the Clank Of Arms: Unusual Shudd'rings rock'd the Alps: And oft in silent Woods were Voices more Than human heard: And Spectres wond'rous pale Seen in the Dusk of Ev'ning: Oxen spoke, (Horrid to tell!) Earth yawn'd, and Streams stood still: In Temples mourning Iv'ry wept; and Brass Sweated: Eridanus, Supreme of Rivers, With roaring Inundation, o'er the Plains, Swept Woods away, and Cattle, with their Stalls. Nor did, mean-while, th'ill-boding Fibres cease To menace Fate; nor Blood to rise in Wells; Nor Cities loudly to resound with Wolves Howling by Night. Ne'er from unclouded Sky Did Lightnings with more nimble Flashes glare; Nor e'er so thick did baleful Comets blaze. For This, Philippi saw the Roman Troops Twice in like Arms engage; and Heav'n thought fit That twice Emathia, and th'extended Fields Of Hæmus, should be fatten'd with our Blood. Nay, and the Time shall come; when in Those Coasts The lab'ring Peasant, with the crooked Share Turning the Glebe, shall plough up Jav'lings furr'd With eating Rust; and with the pond'rous Rakes Clash against empty Helmets; and admire Big, manly Bones, digg'd from their open'd Graves. Ye Tutelary Gods, Thou Romulus, And Parent Vesta, whose Indulgence guards Etrurian Tyber, and the Roman Tow'rs; Permit at least This wondrous Youth to prop The reeling Globe: Long since our Blood has paid Due Forfeit for the Perjuries of Troy. Long since, O Cæsar, the Celestial Court Has envy'd Us Thy Presence; and repines Thou shouldst on mortal Triumphs be employ'd. Where Right and Wrong are blended; O'er the World So many Wars, such various Forms of Vice: Tillage has lost it's due Regard; The Hinds Press'd into Soldiers, Fields lie waste, and wild; And crooked Scythes are hammer'd into Swords. Euphrates here, There Germany makes War: The neighb'ring Cities break their Leagues, and rush To Arms: Mars impious storms o'er all the World. As when the Racers from their Barriers start, Oft whirling round the Goal; The Charioteer Vainly attempts to check the flying Steeds: Himself is born away: The dusty Car Swift smokes along; nor, bounding, hears the Rein. The End of the First Book. BOOK the Second. Thus far of Tillage, and the heavenly Signs: Thee, Bacchus, now I sing; nor less with Thee The late-grown Olive's Plant, and Woodland Trees. Hither, Lenæus, Father, (With thy Gifts All here abounds: For Thee the Field full charg'd With viny Autumn flourishes: For Thee In red o'er-flowing Vats the Vintage foams:) Hither, Lenæus, Father, come; and tinge Thy Legs, unbuskin'd, in new Must, with Me. First, Trees by various Propagation grow: (So Nature has ordain'd:) For some unforc'd By human Industry, spontaneous rise, In Fields abroad, and shade the winding Streams: As the soft Sallow; and the flexile Broom; The Poplar; and grey Willow. Some from Seed: The lofty Chesnut; and Jove's spreading Æsculus, Supreme of Woods; and Oaks, by Greece esteem'd Oracular. A num'rous leafy Race Springs from the Roots of others: As the Elm, And Cherry; Thus too sprouts the infant Bay (Parnassus-born, and by the Muses lov'd,) Beneath it's Parent's more diffusive Shade. These Means by Nature were at first ordain'd: By these Productions ev'ry Species blooms Of Trees, and Shrubs, and Woods, and sacred Groves. Others there are, which long Experience taught, And Art improv'd. One has in Trenches set The Layers, from their Mother's tender Trunk Slip'd off: A Second buries Roots in Mold, And Stocks, and Stakes, cut sharp, or split in four. Some Twigs depress'd, and into Arches bent, Expect Increase, and living Tendrils, shot From their own Bed. Others no Root require; Nor fears the Gard'ner in the Ground to plant A Scion ravish'd from its top-most Boughs. Nay (wond'rous to relate!) the sapless Wood Of Olive, stript, and of its Branches shorn, Emits new Fibres, and shoots deep in Earth. Oft too we see one Tree's ingrafted Sprays Change to another's, nor repent That Change: The Pear's hard Trunk with alien Apples bend; And on the Plumb's the stony Cornel glow. Then mark me well, Ye Farmers, learn of Each The proper Culture; and with due Manure Soften the Wildness of your barb'rous Fruits. Let not your Land lie restive: What Delight On Ismarus to plant the Bacchian Vine, And cloath with Olives huge Taburnus' Sides! And Thou, my Glory, justly of my Fame The greatest Part, be present to my Aid, Mecænas; Thou This Enterprize with Me Pursue; and, flying on the open Main, Unfurl the Sails. Not all could I propose To comprehend within my scanty Song; Had I an hundred Tongues, an hundred Mouths, An iron Voice: Be present yet, and coast Near the first Shore; The Land is in our View: No Tales superfluous shall detain thee here, Nor long Preambles, nor fictitious Verse. Those, which unbidden spring to upper Air, Steril indeed, but strong, and healthy rise; Because by Nature favour'd. Yet ev'n These, If grafted, or, in Trenches well prepar'd, Chang'd and transplanted, will in time unlearn Their salvage Temper; and not slow obey, With frequent Culture, what Your Art commands. The same will Those perform, which barren sprout From the low Roots; if o'er the open Fields They be dispos'd: Their Mothers' shady Tops Now check them, and forbid their Fruits to grow. The Tree which springs from Seed by slow Degrees Advances, and to late Posterity Adjourns it's Shade: It's Fruit degen'rous proves, Losing its native Juices; and the Vine Bears worthless Clusters, Food for Birds alone. Thus must they all be labour'd, all confin'd To Trenches, and with much Expence subdued. From Trunks the Olive, from the Arch the Vine More happy answers; From the solid Stock The Paphian Myrtle; From the Layer's Slip The hardy Hazle springs; and the tall Ashe; The shady Tree which binds Alcides' Brows; Jove's Dodonæan Oak; The lofty Palm; And Pine for future Storms at Sea reserv'd. But with a Filberd's Twig the prickly Arbutus Is grafted: Oft the barren Plane has born The ruddiest Apples; Chesnuts bloom'd on Beech; The Wild-Ashe blossom'd with the Flow'rs of Pears Snow-white; and Swine crack'd Acorns under Elms. Nor single is the Manner to ingraft, Or to inoculate. For where the Gems Bud from the middle Bark, and gently burst The filmy Coats; ev'n in the Knot is made A small Incision: From an alien Tree An Eye is here inclos'd; and taught to grow Congenial, blending with the humid Rind. Or else into the knotless solid Trunk They force a Cleft with Wedges; then insert The fertil Sprigs: Nor long the Time; to Heav'n The Tree with loaden Branches shoots away, Admires new Leaves, and Apples not her own. Besides; Not single is the Species found Of the strong Elm, the Willow, and the Lote; Nor of th'Idæan Cypress: Nor is one The Form in which the fruitful Olive springs; The Orchite, Radius, and the Pausia known By bitter Berrys. Nor the Shoots the same Of Apples, and Alcinous' Groves, and Pears; Diff'rent the Syrian, and Crustumian grows, And Warden of distinguish'd Weight and Size. Nor on our Trees does the same Vintage hang, Which Lesbos crops from Methymnæan Vines. Thasians there are, and Mareotics white, These fit for richer Mold, for lighter Those; And Psythian, best when dry'd; and thin Lageos, Potent to try the Feet, and bind the Tongue; The purple, and the early-ripen'd Grape; And with what Verse, Thee, Rhætic, shall I sing? Nor yet contend thou with Falernian Cells. Th'Ammineans too, most during Wines; to which Ev'n Tmolus, and ev'n King Phanæus bows; And the less Argite, None with which can vie, Either to flow so much, or last so long. Nor, Rhodian, Thee in silence would I pass, Still grateful to the second Cheer, and Gods; Nor Thee, Bumastus, with plump swelling Grapes. But of the various Species, and their Names, No Number is; nor profits it to know Their Number: Which whoe'er would learn, as well May seek to learn how many are the Sands, Which Zephyr tosses in the Libyan Sea; Or, when, more violent, Eurus beats the Ships, How many Waves roll to th'Ionian Shore. Nor can all Soils bear all Things; Willows grow Near Rivers; Alders, in the marshy Lakes; Barren Wild-Ashes, on the rocky Hills; The Shores rejoice in Myrtles; Bacchus loves The open Mountains; Eughs, the North, and Cold. See the most distant Regions, by the Pow'r Of Roman Arms subdu'd; Th'Arabians East, And painted Scythians: By it's proper Trees Each Country is distinguish'd. India sole Bears Ebony; Sabæa, Incense sweet. Why should I name the Balms, which fragrant Wood Sweating distils? Th'Acanthus ever-green, And flourishing with Berries? Why the Groves Of Æthiopia, white with downy Wool? And how the Seres comb from silken Leaves Soft Fleeces? Why Those Lawns should I rehearse, Which India, nearer to the Sea, a Tract Ev'n in th'extremest Limits of the Globe, Produces? Where the highest Air of Trees No Flight of Arrows ever could surmount: Yet no ill Archers does That Nation boast. Media the happy Citron bears, of Juice Pungent, of Taste that dwells upon the Tongue; Than This no Aid more present (when, in Rage Of Jealousy, Stepdames have Draughts infus'd, And mingled Herbs, and not innoxious Charms) T'expel black Poysons from infected Limbs. Huge, tall, It self; and like a Laurel, shap'd; And, did it not a diff'rent Scent diffuse, A Laurel it would be: No Winds it's Leaves Unfix; It's Blossoms most tenacious grow: The Medes with This foment their Mouths, correct Their smelling Breath, and wheezing Sires relieve. But neither wealthy Media's Groves, and Soil, Nor far-fam'd Ganges, nor rich Hermus' Stream, Turbid with Gold, can match Italia's Praise: Nor Bactra, India, nor Panchaia fat. All o'er, with Frankincense-producing Glebe. No Furrows here by Bulls expiring Flame Are turn'd; Nor Teeth of monstrous Dragons sown: Nor rises a dire Crop of Soldiers, throng'd, With Shields, and rigid Spears. But swelling Grain Abounds, and Bacchus' Massic Juice, and Oils, And Herds of shining Neat. The Warriour Steed Prances, with lofty Port, into the Field; White Flocks, and stately Bulls, of Victims chief, Oft plung'd, Clitumnus, in Thy sacred Stream, To Jove's high Fane the Roman Triumphs lead. Here blooms perpetual Spring; and Summer shines In Months not Hers: Here twice the Cattle teem, The Trees twice yield their Fruit. But far from hence Is the fell Tyger, and the savage Breed Of Lions; Nor does Aconite deceive The wretched Simplers. No huge scaly Snake Snatches his Orbs immense along the Ground; Nor into Spires so vast himself convolves. Add That Variety of Cities fam'd; And Labour of Artificers; on Tops Of craggy Rocks so many Towns uprear'd; And Rivers gliding under antient Walls. The Sea, which washes it on either side, Shall I rehearse? Or such extended Lakes, Thee, Larius greatest? or, Benacus, Thee, Whose Waves, like Ocean's, swell, and roar with Storms? Or it's large Ports; and to the Lucrine Bay A Mole now added; and the Sea with Rage Indignant roaring; where the Julian Tide, Impatient of Confinement, bellows loud, (The Sea driv'n back) and into Avernus' Frith The Tyrrhene Chanel pours it's rushing Waves? The same blest Region Veins of Silver shows, Rivers of Brass; and flows in copious Gold. The same a hardy Race of Heroes bore, The Marsians, Samnites, and Ligurians train'd To Labour, and the Volscians arm'd with Piles, The Decii, Marii, and the great Camilli, The Scipio's brave in Fight, and Thee most fam'd, Illustrious Cæsar; who, on Asia's Coasts Remote, Victorious, do'st ev'n Now avert Th'unwarlike Indian from the Roman Tow'rs. Hail, happy Clime! Saturnian Realm! of Fruits, And Men, great Parent! I for Thee attempt This Argument of antient Art, and Fame, Advent'rous to unlock the sacred Springs; And chant, thro' Latian Towns, Ascræan Verse. The Genius of each Soil, it's Colour, Strength, What Product Nature has to Each assign'd, 'Tis Now the Time to tell. First the rough Glebe, And Hills less tractable, where thinner Clay Abounds, and Pebbles in a thorny Field, Rejoice in long-liv'd Olives, Pallas' Grove. This the Wild-Olives shew, when thick they rise On the same Mold, and with their meagre Fruit Bestrew the Ground. But Earth more sweet, and rich With fertil Ooze, and all with Grass o'ergrown, Such as we oft observe in hollow Vales, Whither the Streams from lofty Mountains run, And draw the fatt'ning Slime; and That which lies Obnoxious to the South, and That which breeds Rank Fern, detested by the crooked Plough, Will bear Thee strongest Vines, and most profuse Of Bacchus; This is fruitful of the Grape, And of That Liquor, which from golden Bowls We, for Libation, at the Altars, pour; When the fat Tuscan sounds his Iv'ry Tube, And in curve Chargers to the Gods we offer The smoking Entrails. But if Herds of Kine, Or Sheep, or Goats which kill the tender Trees, Thou study to preserve; The Thickets seek, And rich Tarentum's distant well-fed Soil; Or such a Field as hapless Mantua lost, Feeding white Swans in Mincius' grassy Stream. Nor limpid Springs, nor Pastures to the Flocks Are There deficient; And how much the Herds Crop in long Summer-Days, so much the Dew, Refreshing, in the short cool Night restores. The blackish Mold, and That which fat sinks deep Beneath the Coulter, and the crumbling Earth (For so we strive to make it, when we plough) Is best for Bread-Corn: From no other Field You'll see more Waynes move home with slow-pac'd Steers. And That, from which it's angry Lord transports A Wood, and Groves o'erturns, for many Years, Unprofitable; and the ancient Haunts Of Birds, ev'n with their deepest Roots uprends: Leaving their Nests, They fly into the Clouds; The rude, tough Glebe grows rich beneath the Share. For of the sloping Hills the hungry Gritt, And Gravel, and the Chalk by poys'nous Snakes Corroded, scarce to Bees will Flow'rs supply, Sweet Casia, and the Rosemary's sweet Dew: No other Soil, 'tis said, such grateful Food To Serpents, or such winding Coverts yields. That which exhales thin Mists, and flying Smoke, At pleasure drinks the Moisture, or emits, Still cloaths it self with it's own verdant Grass, Nor hurts the Coulter with salt Rust, or Scurf; That Ground with clustring Vines will wreath thy Elms: That yields thee copious Oil; In thy Manure, That Ground Thou wilt experience for the Herds Most apt; and patient of the crooked Share. Such, wealthy Capua ploughs; and Such, the Coast Near to Vesuvius' Mount; and Clanius, nought Indulgent to Acerræ's empty Walls. Next; how thou may'st distinguish ev'ry Soil, Attend. If whether it be Rare, or Dense, Thou seek to know; (Since One is best for Corn, For Wine the Other; Dense, for Ceres; Rare, For Bacchus:) First a proper Place select; Sink a deep Pit; then to it's Bed restore The Mold, tread close, and smooth the level Sand. If That deficient prove; The Soil is Thin, For Vines, and Pasture fit. But if the Trench Be fill'd, and more, superfluous, still remain; 'Tis a Thick Glebe; Obstructing Clods expect, And toughest Ridges: With thy sturdy Steers Invert them, and cut deep the stubborn Marle. But the Salt Land, the Bitter (as 'tis call'd) Favours not Corn; It mellows not by Arts Of Tillage; nor of Apples, and of Grapes, The diff'rent Species, or the Names, preserves. 'Tis Thus discover'd. From the smoky Roof Take Wicker-Baskets, of tough Sallows made, And Strainers, which receive the running Must; Here let That vicious Earth, with Water drawn From the fresh Spring, be press'd, and trodden close: The Water all, forc'd outwards, will distil; And big round Drops betwixt the Osiers ooze. A sure Discov'ry the salt Relish makes, And writhes th'offended Mouths of Them who taste. The Fat, and Viscid Mold, we Hence discern: Handled, it never crumbles into Dust; But, sticky, to the Fingers cleaves like Pitch. The Moist bears Weeds, and ranker Grass, it self Beyond due measure rank: Ah! let not Mine Too fertil prove, nor shew it self too strong In the first Blade. The Heavy, and the Light, (Nor need we other Marks) themselves betray By their own Weight. 'Tis obvious to perceive, By Sight, the Black, and ev'ry other Hue. But to discover the pernicious Cold, Is difficult: Yet sometimes ev'n of This The Pine, black Ivy, and the nocent Eugh Advise us, and undoubted Signs disclose. These things observ'd; remember, long before You plant the Offspring of your happy Vines, By due Manure to dry, and trench your Glebe; And to the North the Clods supine expose. The crumbling Soil is best; The Winds, and Frosts Will make it such, and the strong Delver's Care Industrious oft to turn the mould'ring Earth. But Those, whom Nought of Vigilance escapes, Of the same Genius chuse two diff'rent Soils; For the first Nurs'ry, This; That, to receive The Slips transplanted: Lest they should disown The sudden Change of Parents. Ev'n their Site Is on the Bark inscrib'd; That, as they stood, On the same side as Each receiv'd the Heat Of Southern Air, or to the Northern Pole Obvious was scituate, Each may be replac'd: Such is the Force of Custom, in green Years Contracted. Whether on the Hills, or Plain, 'Tis best to set your Tendrils, first enquire. If a fat Field you chuse, plant Thick your Vines; Bacchus no less in a thick planted Field Will prove prolific. If a sloping Soil, Rising in Hillocks; Let your Ranks be Thin: Nor let Your Care be less, that 'twixt Those Ranks Each vacant Interval, in Paths across, Squaring, exactly answer. As in War, The long extended Legion forms in Lines It's Cohorts; when the marshal'd Squadrons stand In the wide Plain; and, the whole Army rang'd, The Ground all fluctuates with the brazen Gleam; Nor yet in horrid Shock the Battle joins, But Mars, uncertain, hovers o'er the Field: By such due Distances let all your Paths Be measur'd just: Not only that the Rows May with an empty Prospect please the Sight; But for This too, because the Earth to All Will, otherwise, not equal Strength supply, Nor can the Branches shoot in open Air. Perhaps, how deep 'tis fit to trench the Mold, You will demand. The Vine I should not fear Ev'n to a shallower Furrow to commit: A Tree more strong is lower sunk in Earth; Chiefly the Æsculus; which, as it high Uprears it's Head to Heav'n, so deep in Root Shoots downwards to the Centre: Nor by Storms, Nor Hurricanes, nor wintry Blasts uptorn, Unmov'd it stands; and, many rolling Years, Of our frail Species many an Age survives: Then stretching wide it's Boughs, and sturdy Limbs, It self inclos'd a mighty Shade sustains. Nor let your Vintage to the setting Sun Be turn'd; nor Hazles mingle with your Vines; Nor pluck your Scions from the topmost Boughs; (So much the Love of Parent Earth prevails:) Nor with a blunted Pruner wound your Shoots; Nor in your Vineyards let Wild-Olives grow. For oft by careless Swains neglected Fire Is left; Which first beneath the unctuous Bark Lurks unperceiv'd, invades the solid Wood, And, rising thro' the higher Leaves, to Heav'n With mighty Noise ascends; 'Then Victor reigns Thro' the Top-Branches, and Triumphant rides, Involving all the Grove in Flames; and throws A Cloud of pitchy Vapour to the Sky: Chiefly, if from the North a Tempest roars; And driv'n by Winds the blazing Torrent rolls. No Vines will, after This, from Roots arise; Or sprout by Amputation; or revive Alike in Species from the Deep of Earth: Of nought productive, but of bitter Leaves, The mischievous Wild-Olive sole remains. Let None, however skill'd, on Thee prevail To turn the rigid Earth, when Boreas breathes: Then Winter shuts the Pores; nor with their Roots Permits the Plants to pierce the frozen Mold. 'Tis best in purple Spring to lay your Vines; When the white Bird appears, by winding Snakes Detested: Or in Autumn's first cool Air; E'er with his Steeds the rapid Sun has touch'd The Winter-Tropick, yet the Summer ends. But most indulgent to the Woods and Groves Is the soft Spring; In Spring all Nature swells, And genial Seed requires: With fruitful Show'rs Th'Almighty Parent Æther then diffus'd, Into his gladsom Consort's Lap descends; Fresh Vigour to the various Species gives, And mingles with her universal Mass. Then with melodious Birds the pathless Brakes Resound; and Herds their stated Loves renew: The teeming Earth to Zephyr's tepid Breeze Opens her Bosom; All the Fields abound With kindly Moisture: To new Suns the Herbs Dare trust themselves; Nor aught the tender Vine From rising Auster fears, nor rushing Storms, Which driv'n by Northern Winds descend from Heav'n; But gems it's Buds, and all it's Leaves unfurls. No other Days, I should believe, first shin'd Upon the World, when recent Nature rose: 'Twas then the Spring; Spring smil'd o'er all the Globe, And sharp East-Winds their wintry Blasts forbore: When Cattle first saw Light; the Iron Race Of Men from the hard Glebe up-rear'd it's Head; And Beasts first rang'd the Woods, and Stars the Sky. Nor could the frail Creation bear th'Extremes Of Cold, and Heat; did not betwixt them Both Such Pause at certain Seasons intervene, And Heav'n's Indulgence bless the Fruits of Earth. Next; Whate'er Slips you plant o'er all the Fields, Remember with fat Dung, and copious Soil, To cover them; Or throw in spungy Stones, Or rugged Shells: For 'twixt them will the Rain Dristing insinuate, and thin Vapours breathe; And strong and healthy will your Tendrils rise. There are, who with a Weight of Stones, or Brick Close press them: This against immod'rate Show'rs Is Fence sufficient; This, when Sirius cleaves The Soil adust. Your Plants now set in Earth, It rests to draw the Mold oft round their Roots, And oft to wield the heavy two-fork'd Hough: Or with the Share impress'd to work the Glebe, And goad, ev'n 'twixt your Vines, the struggling Steers. 'Tis Then the Time to fit smooth knotless Canes, And shaven spear-like Poles, and forky Ashe; Prop'd by whose Strength they may defy the Winds, And learn to creep in Ringlets round the Elms. But when the Tree first sprouts with recent Buds; Spare thou their tender Age: And when diffus'd The Branches spread themselves in open Air, With loosen'd Reins; as yet the Steel's sharp Edge Must not be try'd: Thy unarm'd Hand apply; And, 'twixt each other, crop, and cull the Leaves. But when they clasp the Elms with stronger Wreaths; Then prune their Branches, lop their Limbs, (Before, They dread the Steel) a more severe Command Then exercise, and check their flowing Boughs. Let Hedges too be made, to fence thy Groves From Cattle; Chiefly, when the Leaf is young, And not inur'd to Suff'ring: Besides Storms, And the Sun's Heat, the Bufalo's, and Goats, And Sheep, and greedy Heifers, hurt thy Vines. Nor does the Winter, stiff with hoary Frost, Nor Summer, when it drys and burns the Rocks, So noxious, as Those browzing Stragglers, prove: Which, biting, wound the Bark; and in the Scar, Of their hard Teeth the rankling Venom leave. 'Tis for no other Crime an horn'd He-Goat, Sacred to Bacchus, on each Altar bleeds; And ancient Interludes adorn the Scene: And, all the Roads and Villages around, Th'Athenians Prizes for Those Plays propos'd; And jovial o'er their Bowls, in grassy Meads, Danc'd upon Goat-skin Bottles sleek with Oil. Nor less th'Ausonian Colony of Troy Sport in rude Laughter, and unpolish'd Verse; Of hollow Bark, uncouth rough Vizors wear; Thee, Bacchus, Thee with joyous Songs invoke, And hang Thy little Images aloft On a tall Pine. Hence ev'ry Vineyard sprouts, And swells with future Wine: The hollow Vales, And shady Groves, to which soe'er the God Turns his gay Face, with copious Fruit abound. Therefore to Bacchus, in our Country's Verse, We'll chant due Praise; and Cakes, and Chargers, bring: And at his Altar kill the Victim Goat, Dragg'd by the Horns; and roast his well-fed Flesh, On Hazle Spits, before the sacred Fire. For Vines another Toil thou must sustain, Which ne'er can be exhausted; Ev'ry Year, Thrice, and four times, thou must invert the Soil, Break the tough Clods with never-ceasing Houghs, And ease the Branches of luxuriant Leaves. The Farmer's Labour, with the circling Year, Turns on it's self, and in a Round revolves. Now when the Tree it's Autumn-Leaves has shed, And Boreas of it's Honours stripp'd the Groves; Strait to the coming Year the Rustick bends His Diligence; with Saturn's crooked Knife Lops, and by careful Pruning forms, the Vine. Be Thou the First to trench the Glebe, to burn The Sprays cut off, to carry home the Poles; The Last in Vintage. Twice to Vines the Shade Is threat'ning; Weeds and Thorns twice choke the Grapes; Great is the Toil both Mischiefs to remove: Praise Thou large Farms; a small one chuse to till. Nor less in Woods the prickly Shrubs, and Briers, Are cut; and Reeds, which fast by Rivers grow; And the wild Sallow-Twigs employ our Care. And now the Vines are ty'd, nor longer ask The Pruning-Hook; The weary Dresser Now With Songs salutes his outmost Ranks complete: Yet must we still sollicit the dull Mold; And the ripe Grapes have still to fear from Jove. Diff'rent the Olives: They no Culture need, Nor the curve Pruning-Hook, nor Harrow's Teeth Expect; when once they rooted stick in Earth, And, season'd, bear th'Inclemency of Heav'n. The Earth it self, when by the biting Share Upturn'd, sufficient Moisture will supply; And full Fruit, with the Labour of the Plough Coeval: Nourish then That fertil Plant, The Olive, grateful Pledge of pleasing Peace. The Apple too, when first it feels it's Trunk Robust, and in full Vigour stands confirm'd, Shoots sudden to the Stars, nor asks our Aid. Nor less mean-while with Fruit each loaden Grove Abounds; Th'uncultivated Haunts of Birds Glow with red Berries: Of it's Leaves we strip The Cytisus: Tall Woods Materials give For spiky Torches, and nocturnal Light. And doubt we then on These t'employ the Care Of Planting? Why the Greater should I name? The Sallows, and the lowly Broom, afford Or Browze to Cattle, or to Shepherds Shade, Fences to Corn, and Honey-Food to Bees. What Pleasure to behold Cytorus' Mount Waving with Box! Narycium's Groves with Pines! Fields to no Rakes, nor any human Toil Indebted! Ev'n on Caucasus' bleak Top, The steril Woods, by roaring Eastern-Winds Still vex'd, and broken, various Products yield; Yield useful Timber, Pines for Ships, for Houses Cedar, and Cypress: Spokes, and Naves, for Wheels, And crooked Keels for Vessels, hence are form'd: Sallows for Twigs are profitable; Elms For Leaves; For Spears the Myrtle, and in War The Cornel fam'd: The Ityræan Eugh Bends into Bows; Nor does the Linden smooth, And easy-polish'd Box, not Shape receive; But Both are hollow'd by the sharpen'd Steel. Hence the light Alder swims the torrent Stream, Launch'd on the Po: Nor less the Bees in Clefts Of Bark, or in the Concave of an Oak, Vicious with eating Age, conceal their Swarms. What, of such Use, have Bacchus' Gifts to boast? Bacchus of Guilt too has been found the Cause: 'Twas He by Death the raging Centaurs quell'd, Rhætus, and Pholus, and Hylæus arm'd Against the warlike Lapithæan Race, And threatning with a massy Goblet's Weight. O! more than fortunate, did they but know Their Happiness, the Country-Village Swains! For whom, at distance from discordant Arms, The Earth, just Parent, pours forth easy Food. What tho' with Them no Palace, rais'd to Heav'n, From it's proud Portals vomits out a Tide Of Morning-Visitants? Nor do they gape For Luxury of Buildings; Pillars grac'd With Spoils of Tortoises, in various Hue; For broider'd Garments; and Corinthian Brass? Tho' their white Wool imbibes no Syrian Teint; Nor Cinnamon corrupts their Use of Oil? Yet safe Repose, Sincerity of Life, Riches of various Kinds, large Farms, and Ease, Lowings of Herds, and Grots, and living Lakes, Cool Vallies, and sweet Sleep beneath the Shades; They want not. Lawns are there, and Haunts of Beasts; Youth patient of Fatigue, and train'd to live On Little; Rites Divine, and holy Sires: When Justice left the World, she left Them last. Me may the Muses, whose vow'd Priest I am, Smit with strong Passion for their sacred Song, Dear above all to Me, accept; and teach The heav'nly Roads, the Motions of the Stars; The Sun's Defects, the Labours of the Moon; Whence Tremor to the Earth; by what Impulse The Sea swells high, and ebbing back retires; Why Suns in Winter haste so swift to tinge Themselves in Ocean; and what Cause retards The sluggish Nights. But if the colder Blood About my Heart forbid me to approach So near to Nature; may the rural Fields, And Streams, which murm'ring glide along the Vales, Delight me: Groves, and Rivers may I love, Obscure, inglorious. O! where are the Plains, Sperchius, and Taygeta, by the Dames Of Sparta, swoln with Bacchanalian Rage Frequented? O! in Hæmus' Vallies cool Who places me, and covers me with Shade Of thickest Trees, imbow'ring? Blest the Man! Who could of Things the secret Causes trace; And cast all Fears, and Fate's unmov'd Decree, And roaring Acheron, beneath his Feet. Blest too is He, who knows the rural Gods, Pan, old Sylvanus, and the Sister Nymphs. Him nor the Fasces of the State can move, Nor Regal Purple; nor the Hate which reigns 'Twixt faithless Brothers; nor the Dacian Pow'rs, Descending from the Danube leagu'd in Arms; Nor Rome's Affairs, nor Kingdoms doom'd to fall: The Poor his Pity moves not, nor the Rich His Envy. Whate'er Fruits the Trees, and Fields, Spontaneous, and without Compulsion give, He gathers; nor e'er sees the iron Laws, The publick Registers, or noisy Bar. Some vex the Deep with Oars, and rush to Arms; Sollicite Favour in the Courts of Kings: One Spoils from wretched, ruin'd Cities seeks; To quaff in Gems, and snore on Tyrian Dye: This buries Wealth, and broods o'er hoarded Gold: That doats with Fondness on the Rostrum's Fame; Another on th'Applauses of the Cirque, And Theatres; For doubled is th'Applause; The People, and the Fathers both concur: He, set agape, stands ravish'd at the Sound. Some triumph, reeking in their Brothers' Blood; And change for Exile their sweet Native Homes, And seek a Soil warm'd by another Sun. The Farmer with the crooked Plough upturns The Glebe: From hence his annual Labour; Hence His Children, and his Country He sustains, His lowing Herds, and well-deserving Steers. No Pause, but still with Fruit the Year abounds; With Apples, or th'Increase of Ewes and Kine, Or with full Sheaves of Cerealian Culm; And loads the Furrows, and o'erpow'rs the Barns. Winter comes on; The Presses bruise the Fruit Of Sicyonian Olives: Fat with Mast The Swine return: The Woods their Berries yield: Autumn it's various Product too resigns: And Summer on high Rocks the Vintage swells. Mean-while their tender Parents' Kisses round Hang the sweet Babes: The Family, all chaste, Vertue and spotless Modesty preserves. The Kine their Dugs with Milk distended bring; And the fat sportive Kids in Pastures green Frisk on the Turf, and push with butting Horns. Himself the festal Days, religious, keeps; And stretch'd upon the Grass, Thee, Bacchus, calls, Pouring pure Wine to Thee; where in the Midst A Fire burns bright, and the full Bowls are crown'd: Proposes to the Herdsmen, and the Swains, A Match, for Trial of their Skill, to dart The flying Spear against a verdant Elm; And for strong Wrestling bares their sturdy Limbs. This Life of old the antient Sabines led; This, Remus, and his Brother: Thus arose Warlike Etruria: Educated Thus Great Rome became the Mistress of the World, And single with her Walls seven Hills inclos'd. Before the Empire of the Cretian King; E'er impious Nations fed on Oxen slain; Thus Saturn flourish'd in an Age of Gold, On Earth: Nor Mortals yet had heard th'Alarms Of Trumpets, nor the sputt'ring of the Steel On Anvils form'd, and hammer'd into Swords. But We have finish'd our immense Carrier; And now 'tis Time t'unrein the smoking Steeds. The End of the Second Book. BOOK the Third. Thee too, great Pales, and Thee, heav'nly Swain Fam'd from Amphrysus; You, ye shady Groves, And Rivers of Lycæus, next we sing. All other Themes of Verse, which could amuse The vacant Mind, long since are worn with Age: Busiris' Altars, and Eurystheus dire, Who knows not? Who of Hylas has not sung, Or of Latonian Delos? Or the fair Hippodame? Or Pelops in the Race Victorious, and his Iv'ry Shoulder's Fame? A Way by Me too must be try'd, to raise My self from Earth, and fill the Mouths of Men. I first (let Life sufficient but be giv'n) Returning from th'Aonian Mount, will lead The Muses with me to my Native Soil: I first will bring the Idumæan Palms, Mantua, to Thee; and on the verdant Field Of solid Marble found a sacred Dome; Fast by the River, where great Mincius shades His Banks with bending Reeds, and winding errs In slow Meanders. Cæsar in the Midst Shall stand, and all the Temple's Centre grace. For Him, I Victor, and in Tyrian Robes Conspicuous, near the gliding Stream will drive An hundred Chariots by four Horses drawn: Leaving Alpheüs, and Molorchus' Woods, All Greece, my solemn Triumph to adorn, Shall in the Race, and with the rigid Cest Contend. With Foliage of shorn Olive wreath'd About my Head, My self will Off'rings bring; Ev'n now with Joy the solemn Pomp I see Move to the Temple, and the Victims bleed; See how the Scene with shifting Front retires; And how th'inwoven Britons There support The purple figur'd Tapestry they grace. The Indian Battles on th'engraven Doors, In Gold, and solid Elephant, shall shine; And young Quirinus' conqu'ring Arms; The Nile Foaming with War, and rolling sanguine Tides, And Pillars rising high with naval Brass. The vanquish'd Asian Cities shall to These Be added; And Niphates' Mount subdued; The Parthian trusting in his Flight, and Shafts Shot backward; Trophies from two diff'rent Foes Twice snatch'd, and Triumphs twice from either Shore. In breathing Marble antient Kings shall stand; Assaracus' Descendants; Mighty Names Deriv'd from Jove; Tros, Ancestor of Rome; And Phœbus, Author of the Trojan Race. Envy, self-tortur'd, shall with Horrour dread The Furies, and Cocytus' sable Stream, Ixion's twisted Snakes, and racking Wheel, And the rough Rock to endless Ages roll'd. Let us, mean while, the Dryads' Groves unsung Pursue; no easy Task by Thee enjoin'd, Mecænas: Nought sublime, without Thy Aid, My Muse attempts. Begin, break dull Delay: Cithæron calls us, and Taygetus' Hounds, And Epidaurus, skill'd in manag'd Steeds: And Echoing Woods rebellow to the Noise. Yet next, advent'rous, I prepare to sing Great Cæsar's Wars; and to transmit his Fame Descending thro' as long a Tract of Years, As from Tithonus' Birth to Cæsar's Times. Whether, ambitious of th'Olympick Palm, Thou nourish sprightly Steeds; or lusty Steers, Studious of Tillage: Be it first thy Care To chuse the Female-Breeders. Best the Cow, Of Aspect sour: Her Head unshap'd, and large, Her hanging Neck enormous; From her Chin Her swagging Dewlaps to her Knees depend. Her Flank of Length unmeasur'd: All Parts huge; Her Feet too; and beneath her crankled Horns Her Ears uncouth, and rough. Nor shall Her Form Be disapprov'd, whose Skin with Spots of White Is vary'd: Or who struggles with the Yoke, And sometimes pushes with her Horn, in Front A Bull resembles, tall, and big all o'er, And with her Tail, in Walking, sweeps the Ground. Their Age for just Connubials fit, begins After Four Years; before the Tenth, expires: The rest unapt for Teeming, and of Strength Unequal to the Plough. Mean-while, (thy Herds Blooming in vig'rous Youth) let loose the Males, Be Thou the first thy Cattle to indulge In genial Love, and propagate the Race. The Best of Life, which wretched Mortals share, First flies away: Diseases, sick Old Age, And Pain, and Death's Inclemency, succeed. Still there will be, whose Kind thou wouldst desire To vary: Still repair the Breed; nor stay, 'Till thou too late the lost Occasion mourn; With prudent Care prevent the Mischief fear'd, And annually thy failing Herds renew. The same, in chusing Steeds, must be observ'd: Chiefly on Those for future Sires design'd, Ev'n from their tender Age, thy Care employ. The Colt of gen'rous Blood with lofty Port Prances, and nimbly shifts his pliant Limbs: Forward, the first, to range abroad, to tempt The threat'ning Streams, and unknown Bridges pass; Nor dreads he empty Noises. High his Neck, His Head acute, his Belly thin, his Back Fleshy, and round: His Chest with swelling Knots Luxuriant: (Best for Colour is the Bay, And Dappled; Worst, the Sorrel, and the White:) Then if the Clank of distant Arms is heard; He paws impatient, quickens his sharp Ears, And quivers ev'ry Joint, and snorting curbs The Smoke and Fire which in his Nostrils roll. His full thick Main on his right Shoulder plays; A double Spinal Bone his Chine divides; His sounding Hoof with solid Horn upturns The crumbling Mold, and rings against the Ground. Such was fam'd Cyllarus, by Pollux rein'd; And such the Steeds of Mars, by Grecian Bards Immortal made; and Those which drew the Car Of great Achilles. Such a Courser's Form Saturn, his jealous Consort to deceive, Flying, assum'd; when on his Neck he toss'd His waving Main, and neigh'd thro' Pelton's Groves. When weaken'd by Disease, or Years, he fails, Indulge him, Hous'd; And, mindful of the Past, Excuse his not dishonourable Age. The Senior, frigid to the pleasing Fight, Like Fire in Stubble, void of vigour, burns; And impotently rages. Thus forewarn'd, Mark Thou their Age, and Genius: Next to These Their other Arts, their Lineage; and how Each Exults, when Victor, and, when Vanquish'd, mourns. Seest thou not, when the Chariots from the Bars Starting spring forth, and smoke along the Field, How each Contender's Hopes are rais'd arrect, And anxious Fear beats in their throbbing Breasts? Eager they clang the twisted Lash, and prone Diffuse the Reins: The kindling Axis flies; Now low they bend, now rise sublime in Air: Nor Pause, nor Rest; A Cloud of yellow Sand Is rais'd; The Foremost with their Followers' Foam Are cover'd o'er; All panting urge the Race: So great the Thirst of Victory, and Fame. First daring Ericthonius to the Car Four Horses join'd, and rode on rapid Wheels: The Lapithæ first, mounting on their Backs, Added the Reins; and taught them, under Arms, Graceful to form their Steps, to wheel, and turn, Insult the Ground, and proudly pace the Plain. Equal the Toil of Both; With equal Care The Horseman, and the Charioteer, selects A youthful Stallion, fleet, and hot in Blood: If Youth, and Strength he want, th'Attempt is vain; Tho' oft Victorious he has turn'd the Foes To Flight, and boasts Epirus, fam'd for Steeds, Or brave Mycenæ, as his Native Soil, And ev'n from Neptune's Breed his Race derives. These things observ'd; the Time t'indulge the Males In genial Love their utmost Care employs. He, whom they chuse to propagate the Kind, To be the Guide, and Father of the Herd, Is pamper'd with the choicest Food; To Him Young, juicy Herbs, and Corn, and limpid Streams They minister: Lest in the pleasing Task The Sire should fail deficient, and transmit The Parent's Weakness to his feeble Race. Diff'rent their Treatment of the Females: Them They macerate, (when now the known Delight Sollicites their Desires) deny them Food, And drive them from the Streams, with ceaseless Toil Shake them hard driv'n, and work them in the Sun; When Threshing-floors groan with the beaten Grain, And Chaff flies hov'ring in the rising Wind: Lest too much Luxury and Ease should close The Pores, and dull the Hymenëal Soil. The Sires are now neglected; and our Care Alternate on the Females is employ'd; When now, their Months complete, they pregnant rove. Let None permit them Now to draw the Wayne Beneath the heavy Yoke, nor leap, nor run Swift o'er the Meads, nor swim the rapid Streams: In Glades, and near full Rivers let them feed, Where Moss, and greenest Herbage on the Banks Abounds luxuriant; where in Caves they lie, And lofty Rocks refreshing Shades extend. Round Mount Alburnus, green with leafy Oaks, And in the Groves of Silarus, there flies An Insect (Oestrus by the Greeks, by Us 'Tis nam'd Asilus) harsh with humming Noise It flies: By which affrighted from the Woods The Herds all run; Their Bellowings beat the Sky; The Woods, and dry Tanagrus' Banks resound. This Pest of old, to glut her vengeful Ire, Stern Juno to Inachian Iö sent. This too (for in the Heat it rages most) Drive from the teeming Dams; and feed thy Herds, When first the Sun, or Ev'ning Stars appear. After the Birth, our Culture to the Calves Is all transferr'd: First Marks are on them fix'd; Distinguishing their Race, and what Employ For Each is fit: This destin'd to preserve The Species; That for Sacrifice; A Third To cut the Glebe, and turn the stubborn Soil: The rest promiscuous, and unnoted, feed On the green Meadows. Those whom thou wouldst form To Tillage, and the Study of the Plough, Already, in their Nonage, must be train'd, And disciplin'd, and broken; while their Minds Are flexible, and docile of the Toil. Let Collars, first, of slender Sallows made Loose round their Necks be hung: But when their Necks Freeborn they have accustom'd to the Yoke; Join'd by Those Circles let them move in Pairs, And justly match'd their mutual Steps compose. Next let them oft along the level Ground Draw empty Wheels, which lightly mark the Dust: Then let the Beechen Axis, bound with Brass, Move slow, and groan beneath the pond'rous Load. Mean-while with Grass alone, and Leaves, and Sedge Feed not thy untam'd Bullocks; but with Corn Cropt in the Blade: Nor let thy suckling Cows, As whilom, fill the snow-white Pails; but all Their Udders for their tender Offspring drain. But if to Martial Camps thy Study bend, To form the mounted Troop; Or with thy Wheels To whirl along near fam'd Alphëus' Stream, And in Jove's Wood to drive the flying Car; First be the Steed accustom'd to behold The Warrior's Arms, and Courage; to endure The Trumpet, and the rumbling Chariot's Noise, And hear the Bridles rattle in the Stalls: Then more and more to love the soothing Sound Of the clap'd Chest, and proudly to rejoice In the fond Praises of the busy Groom. Thus, when first sever'd from the suckling Dam, Let him be exercis'd, and taught to bear Soft pliant Headstalls; in his weaker Age Yet trembling, nor experienc'd from his Years. But when another Summer to the Third Is added; Let him now begin to wheel In artful Rings; with sounding Hoofs to form His Steps; to manage his alternate Feet Sinuous and flexile; and to paw, and bound With seeming Labour: Then to dare the Winds In Fleetness; and, as if unrein'd, to fly O'er the wide Plain, nor press th'unprinted Sand. As when cold Boreas, from Riphæan Coasts Incumbent, dissipates the Scythian Storms, And dry light Clouds; The Corn, and floating Fields Wave with the Blasts; The lofty Woods roar loud; And long-stretch'd Billows tumble to the Shore: Rapid he flies, and sweeps o'er Lands, and Seas. A Steed thus train'd, or in the spacious Cirque Will sweat, and labour round th'Eleian Goal, And from his Mouth throw Flakes of bloody Foam; Or more obsequious draw the Belgic Car. When now They're broken, and more full in Years; Let them be pamper'd, and enlarge their Size With fatt'ning Corn: For, if high-fed before; Impatient of the Lash, they will refuse The biting Curb, and disobey the Rein. But Nought will more their youthful Strength confirm, (Whether in Steers, or Steeds thou most delight) Than from them to avert, with studious care, Soft Venus, and the hidden Stings of Love. Therefore the Bulls to lonely distant Fields Are driv'n; or by a rising Mountain's Height, Or by a spacious River, from the Herds Dissever'd; or within their plenteous Stalls Hous'd, and confin'd. For sweet with luring Charms The Female, when in Sight, by slow degrees Consumes, and wastes the Vigour of the Male, Unmindful of his Groves, and grassy Meads: And oft to combate with their Horns impels The haughty Rivals. In a Forest wide A beauteous Heifer feeds: With mighty Force They join in Battle, and repeated Wounds Mutual inflict; Black Gore their Bodies laves; Their Horns against each other struggling push Direct; They roar aloud; The Woods, and huge Olympus' Top reverberate the Noise. Nor after This can Both together feed: The Vanquish'd quits the Field; and exil'd seeks Some unknown distant Coast, his dire Disgrace Much mourning, and the haughty Victor's Wounds, And his lost Loves, which unreveng'd he leaves; And looking back, with oft retorted Eye, From his hereditary Realm retires. Therefore with utmost diligence his Strength He exercises; lies all Night on Beds Of Flints; on Sedge, and prickly Brambles feeds; And practises the Fight; Against an Oak Aiming his Horns, he pushes empty Air, And spurns the Sand, preluding to the War. When now his Vigour in full Force returns; He marches, to attack his mindless Foe. As when the Ocean whitens with the Foam, And from afar rolls wavy to the Shore, Roaring with dreadful Noise among the Rocks, And riding, ridgy, of a Mountain's Height; The lowest Deep with circling Eddy boils, And to the Surface hurls the sable Sand. Of ev'ry Kind on Earth, of Men, and Beasts, Of Cattle, Fish, and parti-colour'd Fowl, All rush into This Frenzy, and This Fire; Love is the same to all. Then most severe The Lioness, forgetful of her Whelps, Ranges the Fields: Nor ever thro' the Woods Do unshap'd Bears such wasteful Slaughter spread: Most fatal Then the Tyger; Then the Boar Most fell, and merciless. 'Tis Then (alas!) Ill Travelling on Libya's desart Plains. Seest thou not how the Horse, if once he snuffs The well-known Odour wasted by the Wind, Trembles all o'er; Nor can the Curb, nor Lash, Nor Cliffs, nor Caverns, nor opposing Streams, That whirl huge rocky Fragments, as they roll, Retard his Fury? Ev'n the Sabin Boar Rushes, and whets his Tusks, and stamps, and tears The Ground; against a Tree alternate rubs His brawny Sides, and hardens them to War. What does That Youth, whom unrelenting Love Consumes, and with his Vitals blends his Fire? Darkling, in Dead of Night, he swims the Sea Turbid with sudden Storms: while o'er his Head Thunders the Gate of Heav'n, and from the Rocks With dreadful Roar the broken Waves rebound: Nor can his wretched Parents' Tears, nor She, Th'unhappy Maid, whose Death must follow His, Dissuade Him. What do Bacchus' spotted Lynx'? And Wolves, a savage Race? And Dogs? And Deer, Who, tho' by Nature tim'rous, dare in Love? But more than All, the Fury of the Mares Is wond'rous: Venus' self That Fury sent; What time the Potnian Female-Steeds, which drew The Car of Glaucus, piece-meal tore their Lord. They by the stimulating Force of Love Are driv'n beyond Ascanius' sounding Flood, And craggy Garg arus; o'er Mountains climb, And Rivers pass; And when in Spring the Flame Burns fiercer, (For in Spring that Flame returns) On lofty Rocks they stand; and in their Mouths, Ope'd to the Western Breeze, the gentle Air Receive; and oft (prodigious to relate!) Without Connubials, pregnant by the Wind, O'er Cliffs, and Hills, and lowly Valleys fly; Not tow'rds the East, or to the rising Sun, Nor tow'rds the North, or North-West, or that Point, Whence the black South first low'rs upon the World With Fogs, and Rain, and saddens all the Sky. Hence the Hippomanes, so aptly nam'd By Rusticks, from their Wombs at length distils; Hippomanes, a viscid poys'nous Slime, Which oft dire Stepdames cull, when Spells they try, And mingle Herbs, and not innoxious Charms. But Time flies on, irrevocable flies; While we minutely trace our pleasing Theme. Thus far of Herds. Another Care remains, To manage fleecy Flocks, and shaggy Goats: Great is this Task; From this, ye hardy Swains, Hope You for Praise: And well I know, how great The Labour to subdue These Things to Verse, And dignify an Argument so mean. But Me strong Passion for so sweet a Song Transports in Rapture, thro' Parnassus' Heights The least frequented; Pleas'd Those Paths I trace, Which None before have trod, by soft Ascent Inclining to the pure Castalian Stream. Now, venerable Pales, raise our Strain. First, I ordain, that in warm Huts the Sheep Be fodder'd, 'till the leafy Spring returns; And that the Frosty Ground with Fern, or Straw, Be litter'd underneath them: Lest the Ice Should hurt the tender Cattle, and induce The foul contagious Scab, or cramp their Limbs. Next, I advise that with the verdant Leaves Of Arbutus the Goats may be supply'd, And with fresh Springs; And that their Stalls from Winds Be shelter'd, to the Winter Sun oppos'd, And pointing to the South; when now with Cold, And Rain, Aquarius, setting, shuts the Year. To These is no less Culture due; nor less Their Profit: Tho' Milesian Fleeces, ting'd With Tyrian Purple, swell the Merchant's Gains. These breed more fruitful; These in Milk abound: And ev'n the more they fill the frothing Pails, From their press'd Dugs more plenteous Rivers flow. Nor less their long grey Hairs, and shaggy Beards Cinyphian He-Goats yield; a Cov'ring fit For Tents, and poor industrious Mariners. For Food, they browze the Thickets, and the Top Of bleak Lycæus, prickly Thorns in Brakes, And Bushes which high Rocks, and Mountains love. Themselves, spontaneous, to their Home return, Bringing their Young; and, with their strutting Dugs, Laborious, o'er th'opposing Threshold climb. Therefore Their Want of Care and Guard, to shun The Ills of Life by Thine must be supply'd: From Them with all thy Diligence avert The Frost, and Winds, and Snow; with lib'ral Hand Indulge them Food, and leafy Browze; nor shut, While Winter lasts, thy Magazines of Hay. But when gay Spring returns, and Zephyrs breathe Inviting; to the Lawns and Pastures send Both Goats, and Sheep: When Venus first appears; On the cool Herbage let them feed; while fresh The Morning rises, while the Meads are grey, And most the Cattle on the tender Grass Enjoy the Dew. But when advancing Day, At the fourth Hour, gives Thirst to Men and Beasts; And creaking Grashoppers in Bushes sing; Then let thy Flocks from Wells, or deep-sunk Ponds Drink running Streams, thro' Oaken Pipes convey'd; And in the Mid-day's sultry Fervour seek A shady Vale; Where Jove's tall aged Tree Extends its Length of Boughs; and thick with Oaks A gloomy Grove lets fall its sacred Shade. But when the Sun withdraws; from limpid Streams Repeat their Bev'rage; Let them feed again: When cooling Vesper moderates the Air; And now the Groves are by the dewy Moon Refresh'd; the Shores Halcyone resound; And the sweet Goldfinch warbles thro' the Brakes. Of Libya's Swains, and Pastures, in my Verse Why should I tell? And of their Huts on Plains Thinly dispers'd? Their Flocks whole Days, and Nights, And Months, unshelter'd, thro' long Desarts go, Grazing; So much of Field extended lies: The Shepherd all his Substance with him brings, Itinerant; his Weapons, House, and Gods, His trusty Spartan Dog, and Cretian Shafts. As when the warlike Roman, under Arms, Charg'd with a Baggage of unequal Weight, Pursues his March; and unexpected stands, Pitching his sudden Tent, before the Foe. Not so, in Scythia's Realms; nor near the Lake Mœotis, nor where turbid Ister whirls His yellow Sand; nor where, beneath the Pole, Bleak Rhodope, out-stretch'd, rejoins it's Rocks. There closely hous'd they keep their Herds; No Grass Upon the Fields is seen, no Leaves on Trees: But Frost, and Ice, and ridgy Heaps of Snow, Sev'n Ells in Height, deform the Country round. Eternal Winter reigns, and freezing Winds: The Sun ne'er dissipates the hazy Gloom; Not, when his Steeds mount upwards to the Sky; Nor when he washes in the Ocean's Waves, Red with his Beams, his prone descending Car. The running Streams to sudden Crusts congeal: The Water on it's Surface Iron Wheels Sustains; and Carts are driv'n, where Lighters sail'd. Brass splits; Their russling Garments stiffen frore; With Axes Wine is hewn; To solid Glass The standing Puddles in the Dikes are turn'd; And Icicles hang rigid from their Beards. Nor less, mean-while, it snows o'er all the Air: The Cattle die; The Neat, of bulky Size, With Frost surrounded stand; The Stags in Droves, Benumb'd beneath th'unusual Weight, scarce raise Their Heads, or with their topmost Horns appear. These the rough Hunters nor with Dogs, nor Toils, Nor with the Line of crimson Plumes pursue; But, as in vain they labour with their Breasts, And push against th'opposing Hills of Snow, Stab them, with Swords, or Spears, in closer Fight, Braying aloud; and, with a mighty Shout, Triumphant, carry off the bleeding Prey. Themselves in low-sunk Caverns, under Ground, Secure, and jovial live; whole Oaks, and Elms, Roll to the Hearths, and pile them on the Fire; In Mirth and Jollity protract the Night; And Beer, and Cyder quaff, instead of Wine. Such is th'unbroken Race of Men, who live Beneath the Pole; by rough Riphæan Blasts For ever buffeted, and with the Skins And tawny Furs of Beasts their Bodies cloath. If Wool be thy Delight; From prickly Brakes, And Burs, and Thistles, be thy Flocks remov'd: Rich Pastures shun; soft, snow-white Fleeces chuse. The Ram, tho' white Himself, if underneath His humid Palate ev'n his Tongue be black, Discard, (lest He with sable Spots infect The new-born Lambs, discolouring the Race) And seek Another o'er the well-stock'd Field. With Wool of This pure Teint (if such a Fame Deserve our Credit) Pan, th'Arcadian God, Deceiv'd Thee, Cynthia, by That Gift allur'd; Nor wert Thou coy to follow, at his Call, Into the deep Recesses of the Grove. But He, whose Study is on Milk employ'd, With Lote, and Citysus must store the Cribs; And minister salt Herbs: For fodder'd Thus They drink the more, the more distend their Dugs, And in their Milk the hidden Salt retain. Some sever from their Dams the well-grown Kids, And with hard prickly Muzles bind their Mouths. What with the rising Morn, or in the Day, They milk'd, at Night they press: But what at Eve And with the setting Sun, in Vats and Pails, The Shepherd, early, to the Town conveys; Or lightly salted keeps for Winter-Store. Nor be thy Care of Dogs the last; but feed With fatt'ning Whey the brave Molossian Race, And the fleet Spartan: Never (while They watch) The nightly Thief, or Inroads of the Wolf, Or ravaging Iberian, shalt thou fear. Oft too with Hounds the timorous Wild-Ass Thou shalt pursue; with Hounds, the Hare, and Hind; Oft from his Wallowing-Beds in Thickets rouse The silvan Boar, and chase him in full Cry; And o'er the lofty Mountains, with a Shout, The stately Stag into thy Toyls impel. Learn too with Smoke of Cedar to perfume Thy Stalls, and drive away with Scent of Gums The hostile Serpents. Oft beneath thy Cribs Unmov'd, the Viper, of pernicious Touch, Lurks unperceiv'd, and frighted flies the Light: Or the huge Snake, to Coverts, and the Shade, Accustom'd, direful Pest of lowing Herds, Infects them with his Poyson; and to Earth Clings, skulking. Farmer, fill thy Hand with Stones, Or with a Club; and Him with wrathful Hiss Threatning aloud, and heaving his swoln Neck, Demolish: Now in Flight full deep he hides His coward Head; when now his middle Folds Lie slacken'd, and unfurl'd; and of his Tail Th'extremest Winding drags it's lingring Spires. A Serpent too of more distinguish'd Note Lurks in Calabria's Woods; His Breast erect; His scaly Back convolv'd; His Belly long, And speckled with large Spots. While Rivers burst From Fountains; while in dewy Spring the Earth Is moisten'd by the rainy Southern Winds; He lives in Water: and, the Nooks of Banks Inhabiting, on Fish, and croaking Frogs, Voracious, feeds; and crams his filthy Maw. But when the Ponds are dry'd, and Summer cleaves The Soil adust; He darts into the Fields, Raging, and rolling round his fiery Eyes, Scar'd by the Heat, exasp'rated with Thirst. Ah! may I never Then in open Air Sweet Sleep indulge, nor lie upon the Grass In a cool Glade; when, having cast his Skin, And new, and sleek in glitt'ring Youth, he rolls; Or, leaving in his Den his Eggs, or Young, Sublime against the Sun, his burnish'd Crest Uprears, and darts his quiv'ring forky Tongue. Diseases next, their Causes, and their Signs, I will explain. The foul contagious Scab Seizes the Sheep: when far into their Flesh The Cold of Rain, or Winter's hoary Frost Has sunk; Or to their new-shorn Sides the Sweat Adheres, unwash'd away; Or prickly Briers Their Bodies wound. This Mischief to prevent, The Swains in clear fresh Rivers wash their Flocks; The Ram, when plung'd into the Flood, dismiss'd Swims down, and smoothly cuts the current Stream: Or with the bitter Lees of Oil they tinge Their Bodies shorn; and mingle Silver's Spume, And living Sulphur, and Sea-Leek, and Wax, Idæan Pitch, and viscid unctuous Tar, Rank Hellebore, and black Bitumen's Slime. But of all Remedies more present found Is None, than with the sharpen'd Steel to launce The Ulcer's Orifice: The Mischief lives By being hid, and more invet'rate grows; While to the Malady the restive Swain Refuses to apply his healing Hands, And, sitting, prays the Gods for better Fate. But when th'acute Disease has pierc'd more deep. Raging within the bleating Patient's Bones; And on his Limbs a scorching Fever feeds; 'Twill profit, to avert the burning Heat, And open in his Foot the leaping Vein: As the Bisaltæ practise, and the fierce Geloni; when to Rhodope they fly, And to the Getie Desarts; where they drink Coagulated Milk, with Horses Blood. Whatever Sheep thou seest to Shades retire More frequent; or more negligently chew The topmost Grass; or loiter in the Rear; Or, feeding, on the Field lie down; or late, And lonely, with the Close of Eve, returne Delay not, kill th'Infected; e'er thro' all Th'unwary Flock the dire Contagion spread. Less multiply'd are Whirlwinds in a Storm, Than Plagues among the Cattle: Nor content With single Deaths, they sweep whole Plains at once, Whole Folds, and Herds, and all their future Hopes. This may He know; who views th'aëreal Alps, And Noric Castles, high, on Mountains rear'd; And Countries water'd by Timavus' Stream; The Shepherds' Kingdoms ev'n Now desart seen; And far and wide the desolated Groves. 'Twas Here, long since, a Plague from tainted Air Rose, and with all the Fires of Autumn burn'd; Beasts, tame, and savage, of all Species, slew; Poyson'd the Rivers; o'er the Pastures spread Contagious Juice. Nor simple was the Form Of Death: For when the burning Fever, shot Thro' all their Veins, had cramp'd their tortur'd Limbs; A fluid Slime abounded; and their Bones, Piecemeal dissolv'd, to it's own Substance turn'd. Oft, standing at the Altar, and with Wreaths, And woolly Fillets bound, the Victim Bull, In the mid Honour of the Gods, fell dead Between the lingring Sacrificers' Hands. Or if the Priest dispatch'd him, e'er he fell; The Fibres burn not, on the Altars laid; Nor can the holy Seer, consulted, give The Answers of the Gods; The Knives, beneath Infix'd, are faintly redden'd with the Gore; A meagre Stream of putrid Matter flows, And scarce imbrowns the Surface of the Sand. In ev'ry Pasture, on the verdant Grass, The Calves all die; and render their sweet Souls Before the plenteous Racks: The gentle Dogs Run mad: The wheezing Swine with rattling Coughs Are torn, and strangled in their swelling Throats. Unhappy of his Toils, the Victor Steed Sinks, and forgets his Food; and loaths the Streams, And paws the Ground, and hangs his flaggring Ears; Bedew'd with doubtful Sweats; and Those, near Death, Clammy, and cold: His rigid Hide resists The Touch, and harden'd no Impression takes. These Symptoms first: But, as the Evil grows More obstinate, and gathers Strength from Time; His Eyes are all inflam'd; From his deep Breast His Breath with Labour heaves; Long Sobs and Groans Distend his Entrails: From his Nostrils drops Black ropy Gore; and to his Jaws his Tongue, Clotted with Filth, and Putrefaction, cleaves. A Drench of Wine at first was helpful found, Pour'd thro' a Horn; That seem'd the sole Ressource: At length ev'n That prov'd fatal; and, with Rage Recruited, in the Pangs of Death, they tore With their bare Teeth their mangled Flesh: Ye Gods, To pious Mortals grant a better Mind, And turn That dire Distraction on our Foes. Smoking beneath the Plough the sturdy Steer Falls down, and spues a Flood of Gore and Foam, And groans his last: The pensive Hind unyokes His mourning Fellow-Lab'rer, and amidst Th'unfinish'd Furrow leaves the sticking Share. No Shades of Groves, no grassy Meads can move His Soul; Nor Streams, which, rolling o'er the Stones, Purer than Crystal, glide along the Fields: His long deep Flank hangs flabby, and relax'd; Fix'd in their Sockets stand his stupid Eyes; And prone to Earth his heavy Head hangs down. What Now avail his Toils to human Kind Beneficent? What boots him to have turn'd The stubborn Glebe? Yet not the Massic Gifts Of Bacchus, no rich Banquets, cause their Pain: The Trees, and Pastures, yield them simple Food; Their Bev'rage, limpid Springs, and running Streams; Nor is their healthful Sleep disturb'd by Cares. 'Twas Then, they say, that Kine, for Juno's Rites, Were wanting; and by Bufaloes ill-match'd Her Chariots to the stately Temples drawn. Then too the Earth was by the weary Hinds Themselves, instead of Ploughs, with Harrows, till'd; With their own Hands they dug, and set the Grain; And, o'er the lofty Mountains, on their Necks, Strain'd with vast Labour, drew the rattling Car. The Wolf no longer, nightly roaming round, Prouls, and explores the Cotts; A sharper Care Subdues him: Now the tim'rous Hinds and Deer Among the Dogs, and round the Houses, rove. Now the vast Ocean's Progeny, and all The finny Race, like ship-wreck'd Bodies, thrown Upon the Shore, lie beaten by the Waves: The Phocæ to the wond'ring Rivers fly: The Viper, vainly by her winding Den Defended, and the Snakes, with staring Scales, Amaz'd expire. Ev'n to the Birds the Air Is mortal; and beneath the Clouds aloft They leave their Lives, and headlong fall to Earth. Nor aught the Change of Pasture now avails; The med'c'nal Arts prove hurtful: In Those Arts The Chief, fam'd Chiron, and Melampus, cease Their fruitless Labour. From the Stygian Gloom To upper Light Tisiphone ascends; Before her drives Diseases, and Dismay; Rages, and, rising, higher still uprears Her baleful Head, and gains upon the Sky. With bleating Sheep, and lowing Herds, the Streams, The sloping Mountains, and dry Banks, resound. Now Heaps on Heaps expire: Ev'n in the Stalls, And Stables, Carcasses promiscuous lie, Rotting in Gore: 'Till, urg'd by That Distress, They learnt to hide, and bury them in Earth. For of their Skins no Use was made; Their Flesh No Water could dilute, nor Fire subdue. Nor could they shear the Fleeces, by the Plague, And running Sores corrupted; nor ev'n touch, Unhurt, the putrid Wool: Or if they try'd Th'infectious Cloathing; fiery Whelks, and Blains, And Sweats, of noisome Stench, their Bodies seiz'd: And in short space, from That contagious Touch, The sacred Fire their tainted Limbs devour'd. The End of the Third Book. BOOK the Fourth. Aereal Honey next, celestial Gift, I sing: This too, Mecænas, claims your Thoughts. Wonders conceal'd in little Things to You I will unfold; brave Chiefs, of all the Race The various People, Manners, Studies, Arts, And Battles. Small the Argument: Not small The Glory; if the unpropitious Pow'rs Oppose not, and Apollo hears our Pray'r. First for Your Bees a Station must be found, To Gusts of Wind impervious; For the Winds Forbid them to bring home their balmy Spoils: Nor let the Sheep, or frisking Kids, insult The Flow'rs; nor Heifers, roaming o'er the Field, Shake off the Dew, or crush the rising Herbs. Far from their Hives be speckled Lizards driv'n; The Woodpeck, too; and Progne, on her Breast, Distinct with Spots of Blood: For These of All Wide Ravage make; and ev'n the humming Prey Snatch'd in their Mouths bear to their cruel Young, Grateful Repast. But let fresh Springs, and Ponds Verdant with Moss, be near; and shallow Brooks, That with swift Current thro' the Meadows run: And let a Palm, or huge Wild-Olive, shade The Entrance: That, when first the recent Kings Draw out their Swarms; and, issuing from the Hives, The Youth luxuriant sports in vernal Air; The neighb'ring Banks may tempt them to avoid The Heat; and Trees with hospitable Boughs Obvious detain them. Whether dull in Ponds Thy Water stand, or flow in living Rills; Into the Midst throw Willow-Boughs across, And planky Stones: Where, as on Bridges rais'd, They may alight; and to the Summer-Sun Expand their Wings; if chance the Eastern Blast Boist'rous has sprinkled them returning late; Or plung'd them, blown askance, into the Waves. Near These, let Store of Lavender, and Thyme, Strong-scented Herbs, and Mint, and Sav'ry grow; And Beds of Violets drink the running Stream. Whether thy Hives compact of hollow Bark Be made, or wov'n with bending Osier-Twigs; Still be the Entrance strait: For Winter's Cold Coagulates the Honey; Summer's Heat Melts and dissolves it. Either by the Bees Alike is to be dreaded: Nor for Nought Do They with Wax, and Flow'rs, and Fucus fill And point the narrow Cranies of their Cells; And for this Purpose hoard collected Glew, More tough than Birdlime, or Idæan Pitch. Oft too in Caverns, (if we credit Fame) They dig their secret Mansions; and in Clefts Of Pumice, and in hollow Oaks are found. Yet not the less do Thou their chinky Walls Daub with smooth Clay; and plaister them around, And add thin Leaves. Nor nigh Those Walls permit The Eugh; Nor burn the redd'ning Crabs; nor trust Deep Waters; nor let Dung of noisome Scent Be near; nor concave Rocks, from which, when struck With Noise, the Image of a Voice rebounds. For what remains; when Sol beneath the Globe Has banish'd Winter, and with Summer's Light Enlarg'd the Air; thro' Lawns, and Groves they fly, And sip the purple Flow'rs, and skim the Streams: Hence studious, with I know not what Delight, They feed-their tender Young; and build, with Art, Their waxen Cells; and work the viscous Sweets. Hence, when a Swarm, from it's disburthen'd Hive, Swimming thro' Heav'n's high Arch thou shalt behold, And wond'ring see a Cloud in Air serene Black'ning aloft, and wafted by the Wind; Observe: Fresh Springs, and Trees they always seek; Here sprinkle Thou th'appointed Odours, Juice Of Baum, and Honey-suckle's vulgar Flow'r; And ring the sounding Brass, and round them shake The Berecynthian Timbrel: They themselves Will on the medicated Place alight, And nestle in the inmost Hive's Recess. But if to Fight They issue forth; (for oft Between two Kings, with Tumult, Discord reigns:) The Vulgar's Rage, and Courage, and their Hearts Trembling with eager Appetite of War, You may foreknow. A Clarion, shrill as Brass, Rouses the Laggers; and a Martial Noise Distant is heard, like Trumpets' broken Sounds. Then trembling they unite, and shake their Wings, And with their sharp Proboscis whet their Darts, And fit their Claws; and round their Monarch's Court Thicken, and muster; and with loud Acclaim Provoke the Foe. Now, having gain'd a Sky Serene, and open Fields of vernal Air, They issue from their Gates; and join the Shock Of Battle: Humming thro' th'Ethereal Void, In one huge Cluster they conglobe, and fall Precipitant; Not thicker falls the Hail, Nor Show'rs of Acorns from a shaken Oak. The Kings Themselves, betwixt the middle Ranks, Conspicuous shine, and spread their glist'ning Wings, (Their little Bodies mighty Souls inform!) Resolute not to yield, 'till These, or Those, Push'd by the Victor, turn their Backs in Flight. These fierce Encounters, and This Martial Rage, A little Dust thrown upwards will allay. But when both Leaders from the foughten Field Thou hast recall'd; the Vanquish'd, lest he live, Hurtful, on Plunder, by thy Hand must bleed; The Conqu'ror in his Court, unrival'd, reign. The One (for diff'rent are their Species) burns With vary'd Spots, and Gold; His Form all o'er Beauteous, and bright with glist'ring Scales: This Kind The Best; The other horrid, and with Sloth Inglorious, trails his swagging Paunch along. Nor less the People, than their Kings, are found Of Forms distinct: Some foul, of dusky Hue; As when the Trav'ler, on a sandy Road, From his dry Mouth spits Froth commix'd with Dust: Some glaring shine, and glow with Drops of Gold. Be These preferr'd: From These, at stated Times, Sweet Honey thou shalt press; yet not so sweet, As pure, and fine, and fitted to correct The harsher Relish of the Bacchian Juice. But when the Swarms uncertain sport in Air, Disdain their Combs, and quit their vacant Hives; Do Thou forbid their foolish Play, and fix Their flutt'ring Thoughts. Nor arduous is the Task: Clip their Kings' Pinions; While They stay, not One Durst march, or move the Standard from the Camp. Let Gardens, breathing with sweet-scented Flow'rs, Invite them; and Priapus with his Scythe Of Willow, terrible to Thieves, and Birds, Those Gardens keep. Let Him, whom such a Care Sollicits, from the lofty Mountains bring Fresh Thyme, and gummy Pines; and plant them round Their Straw-built Tents: Nor let Himself refuse. With the hard Labour to indent his Hand; With his own Hand the fertile Layers fix In Earth, and o'er them sprinkle friendly Show'rs. And Here, did I not hasten now to furl My Sails, and turn my Vessel to the Shore; Perhaps of fruitful Gardens I might sing, What Care must on their Culture be employ'd; How twice each Year the Pestan Roses bloom; How Endive, and green Banks where Parsley grows, Rejoicing drink the Rills; and thro' the Grass The tortuous bellying Cucumber creeps on: Nor would I pass unsung Narcissus' Flow'r Late-blowing, nor Acanthus' flexile Stalk, Pale Ivy, and the Myrtle loving Shores. For underneath Oebalia's lofty Tow'rs, Where black Galesus' Stream the yellow Glebe Refreshes, I remember to have seen An old Corycian Yeoman; to whose Lot A few hereditary Acres fell: The Soil to Steers unfriendly, and to Sheep; Nor for the Vine commodious. Yet ev'n Here He in This Mold, with Thorns e'erwhile o'ergrown, Planting thin Sallad, and white Lilies, round, Vervain, and wholesome Poppies, in his Thoughts Equal'd a Monarch's Wealth; and, late at Night Returning home, with unbought Viands crown'd His plenteous Board: In Autumn, first was He To pluck the Apple; and in Spring, the Rose. Ev'n when sharp Winter cleft the Rocks with Frost, And fast in Chains of Ice the Rivers bound; Ev'n Then he shear'd the soft Acanthus' Leaves, Slow Summer blam'd, and Zephyr's ling'ring Breeze. Therefore in well-stock'd Hives, and num'rous Swarms He first abounded; from the Combs first squeez'd The frothing Honey: The Linden, and the Pine Flourish'd for Him; and whate'er Apples Spring Promis'd in Blossoms, Autumn ripen'd gave. He too in Ranks dispos'd the late-grown Elms, And the hard Pear-Tree, and the Plumb ev'n Then Laden with Fruitage; and the Plane which yields To Bacchus' Sons its hospitable Shade. But These I pass, in narrow Bounds confin'd; And leave by future Poets to be sung. Next I'll unfold, what Nature to the Bee By Jove Himself was giv'n; For which Reward, Following the Sound of Corybantian Brass, They fed Heav'n's King beneath the Cretian Cave. Of all the mute Creation These alone A publick Weal, and common Int'rest know, Imbody'd; and subsist by certain Laws. Mindful of Winter, they in Summer toil; And for their Country's Good preserve their Store. Some, by joint Compact, range the Fields for Food, Industrious: Others in their Tents at home Narcissus' clammy Tears, and Gum from Trees, Lay, as the first Foundation of their Combs; Then into Arches build the viscid Wax: Others draw forth their Colonies adult, The Nation's Hope: Some work the purer Sweets, And with the liquid Nectar stretch their Cells: Some (such their Post allotted) at the Gates, Stand Sentry; and alternate watch, the Rain, And Clouds, observing; or unlade their Friends Returning; or in Troops beat off the Drones, A lazy Cattle: Hot the Work proceeds; And fresh with Thyme the fragrant Honey smells. As when the Cyclops from the glowing Mass Labour Jove's Bolts: In breathing Bellows, Some Receive, and render back, th'included Air; Others in Water tinge the sputt'ring Brass; Ætna with batter'd Anvils groans around: They with vast Strength in equal Measures raise Their Arms; and turn the Mass with griping Tongs. So (if great Things we may compare with small) The inbred Love of Getting prompts the Bees Their Labours to divide. The aged Sires With curious Architecture build their Cells; And guard their Towns; and fortify their Combs. But late at Night the Youth fatigu'd return; Their Legs with Thyme full-laden: Hov'ring round They suck the Arbutus, and Willows grey, Sweet Lavender, and Crocus' yellow Flow'r, The purple Hyacinth, and gummy Lime. They toil Together, and Together rest: With the first Morn they issue from their Gates; Again, when Vesper warns them to return From Feeding, and the Fields; they homewards bend, Refresh their Bodies, and with murm'ring Noise Hum round the Sides, and Entrance of their Hives: At length in Silence hush'd all Night repose; And their own Sleep relieves their weary Limbs. While Rain impends, or Winds begin to rise; They rove not far from Home, nor trust the Sky: But drink, secure, beneath their City's Walls; And short Excursions try; and oft with Sand Ballast Themselves, like Ships on tossing Waves, And poise their Bodies thro' the Void of Air. One Quality in Bees thou wilt admire; That genial Love they know not, nor indulge Venus' soft Joys, nor propagate their Kind. From Herbs, and fragrant Simples, with their Mouths They cull their Young; From thence the Insect King, And all his little Subjects they supply; And build their Palaces, and waxen Realms. Oft too, as o'er hard Flints they rove, they tear Their filmy Wings; and chuse, o'ercharg'd, to die Beneath the fragrant Burthen. Such their Love Of Flow'rs; so pow'rful is their Thirst of Fame In forming Honey. Therefore tho' their Term Of Life be short, (sev'n Summers, and no more;) Yet the immortal Progeny remains: For many Years the Kingdom's Fortune stands; And Grandsires number Grandsires in their Line. Besides; not Egypt, nor wide Lydia's Realms, Nor Parthia, nor Hydaspes, with such Zeal Adore their King. Their King surviving, All Unanimous concur; His Death dissolves Society: Themselves their Honey-Stores, And all the curious Texture of their Combs, Demolish. He o'er all their Works presides; Him they admire; and in one Body form'd, Humming, inclose him round; And oft in War Support him on their Shoulders; for His Life Expose Their own, and court the glorious Death. Some think, by These Appearances induc'd, That to the Bees an Energy Divine, And Part of the Celestial Mind, is giv'n; For that a God, diffus'd thro' all the Mass, Pervades the Earth, the Sea, and Deep of Air: Hence Men, and Cattle, Herds, and savage Beasts, All at their Births, receive ethereal Life; Hither again, dissolv'd, they back return; Nor Death takes place; but all, immortal, fly To Heav'n, and in their proper Stars reside. Whenever You undam their narrow Cells, And take their treasur'd Sweets; first from your Mouth Spurt Water on them, and before You send The hated Scent of persecuting Smoke. Twice They condense their Honey; Twice You seize The balmy Spoils: When first Taygete shews Her beauteous Head, and spurns the Ocean's Waves; Or, yielding to the show'ry Fish, from Heav'n, More sad, into the stormy Sea descends. No Bounds their Anger knows: but, when provok'd, Into their Stings sharp Venom they inspire; And leave their hidden Darts, among the Veins Infix'd; and shoot their Souls into the Wound. But if the Winter's keener Blasts you dread, And for the Future save; their broken State Commiserating, and their drooping Cheer: Yet who would doubt to fumigate their Hives With Thyme, and pare the empty Wax away? For oft the skulking Lizard eats their Combs; Their Cells are stuff'd with Grubs that shun the Light; The lazy Drone that preys on Others' Toils, And the rough Hornet in unequal Arms, Warring, engage: And Moths, an hostile Race; And Spiders, hated by Minerva, hang Their loose intangling Webs before their Gates. The more they are exhausted; still the more They All, industrious, labour to repair The Ruins of the sinking State, to fill Their Cells, and work their Combs with Wax from Flow'rs. But if (for They like Us th'allotted Ills Of Life partake) by any sore Disease Their Bodies languish; That by certain Signs Thou may'st discern. When sick, of diff'rent Hue They will appear, emaciated, and foul; The Corpses of their Dead with fun'ral Pomp They carry, and in sad Procession move: Or thick in Clusters hang before their Doors; Or All confin'd within their Houses stay, Slothful in Penury, and Cramp'd with Cold. Then a long drawling heavier Hum is heard; As when cool Auster whispers thro' the Woods; Or Ocean murmurs, hoarse with refluent Waves; Or rapid Fire, pent in a Furnace, roars. Here I advise to burn strong-scented Gums; And Honey to convey thro' Pipes of Cane; Inviting them to taste their well-known Food. 'Twill further profit, the Oak-Apple's Juice To mingle; and dry Roses; or rich Wine, Whose third Part has evap'rated by Fire; Or Grapes which from the Psythian Vine are dry'd; Rank-smelling Cent'ry; and Cecroprian Thyme. In Meadows too there grows a Flow'r, by Swains Amellus call'd, and obvious to be found; For from one Turf a mighty Grove it rears: It's Stem of golden Hue; but in it's Leaves, Which copious round it sprout, the purple Teint Of deep-dy'd Violets more glossy shines. Oft it adorns the Altars of the Gods With twining Wreaths: Harsh is it's Taste: The Swains, In new-mow'd Vales, near Mella's winding Stream, Gather This Herb: Do Thou with fragrant Wine Seeth it's bruis'd Roots; and in full Baskets hang These Viands at the Entrance of their Hives. But if the Race be totally extinct; Nor any Method to restore it, known: 'Tis time the great Invention to unfold, Which by th'Arcadian Shepherd was disclos'd; How, oft, from putrid Gore of Cattle slain Bees have been bred: This Wonder I will trace From it's first Source, and open all the Fame. For where the Bord'rers of o'erflowing Nile In fortunate Canopus live, and round Their delug'd Fields in painted Galleys sail; Where Quiver-bearing Persia's neighb'ring Coasts Urge them, contiguous; and the River, roll'd From swarthy India, thro' sev'n Chanels roars, Fatt'ning green Egypt with it's sable Sand: All the wide Region from This Art expects Infallible Relief. A narrow Place, And for That Use contracted, first they chuse; Then more contract it, in a narrower room, Wall'd round, and cover'd with a low-built Roof; And add four Windows, of a slanting Light, From the four Winds. A Bullock then is sought, His Horns just bending in their second Year; Him, much reluctant, with o'erpow'ring Force, They bind; his Mouth, and Nostrils stop, and all The Avenues of Respiration close; And buffet him to Death: His Hide no Wound Receives; His batter'd Entrails burst Within. Thus pent they leave him; and beneath his Sides Lay Shreds of Boughs, fresh Lavender, and Thyme. This; when soft Zephyrs' Breeze first curls the Waves, Before the Meadows blush with recent Flow'rs, And prattling Swallows hang their Nests on high. Mean-while the Juices in the tender Bones Heated ferment; and (wond'rous to behold) Small Animals, in Clusters, thick are seen, Short of their Legs at first: On filmy Wings, Humming, at length they rise; and more and more Fan the thin Air: 'till, numberless as Drops Pour'd down in Rain from Summer-Clouds, they fly; Or as fleet Shafts, shot from the twanging Nerve, When the swift Parthians first engage in Fight. What God, Ye Muses, Author of This Art, Disclos'd the new Experiment to Man? The Shepherd Aristæus (such the Fame) Flying Penëian Tempe, having lost His Bees, by Famine, and by Plagues consum'd, Stood pensive at the sacred River's Head; And to his Sea-green Parent Thus complain'd. Mother, Cyrene; Mother, of This Stream Profound, Inhabitant; Why bore you Me (If, as You boast, Apollo be my Sire) Of Race Celestial, yet accurst by Fate? Or whither is your Love for Me withdrawn? You bade me hope for Heav'n: Ah! Why Those Hopes? Lo! Ev'n This Honour of a Mortal State, The Custody of Cattle, and of Corn, Which by unweary'd Diligence and Toil, All Things exploring, I struck out at last, Ev'n This I lose; and yet am call'd Your Son. Go on then; and uproot my happy Groves With your own Hand; my Crops, and Stables burn; Murder my Harvests; Lay my Vineyards waste: Since such your Envy of my rising Fame. These Sounds, beneath the Chambers of the Deep, His Mother heard: The Nymphs around her sate, Spinning Milesian Fleeces, deeply dy'd In Juice of glassy Green; Phyllodoce, Drymo, Ligéa, Xantho, their bright Hair Loose flowing down their snow-white Necks; Thalia, Nesæe, Spio, and Cymodoce; Yellow Lycorias, and Cydippe fair, The Last a Virgin, in Lucina's Pains The Other just experienc'd; Beröe, And Clio, Daughters of old Ocean Both, Both clad in Gold, and spotted Skins of Beasts; Ephyre, Opis, Asian Dëiopeia, And Arethusa, Huntress now no more. Them Clymene amus'd with pleasing Tales; Related Vulcan's unsuccessful Care, And the sweet Thefts, and delicate Intrigues, Of Mars: Deduc'd the Lineage of the Gods, And down from Chaos trac'd their num'rous Loves. While, with such Songs delighted, They on Reels Wind the soft Yarn; again the plaintive Voice Of Aristæus strikes his Mother's Ears: Amaz'd All listen, on their crystal Seats; But Arethusa, sooner than the rest, Above the Waves uprears her beauteous Head; And Thus from far: O not in vain alarm'd By such Complaints, Cyrene, Sister, see; Himself, Your chief Concern, your darling Care, The pensive Aristæus, at the Head Of Father Peneus' River, weeping stands; And calls you cruel, and invokes your Name. To whom Cyrene, struck with sudden Fear; Conduct, conduct him to Us: He by Fate Is free to visit the Divine Abodes. At once she bids on either side retire The Rivers, that the Youth unhurt might pass: Him, like a Mountain, arch'd, the standing Waves Surround; their spacious Bosom open wide, And speed his Entrance to the hoary Deep. And now admiring at his Mother's Court, And liquid Realms, the Lakes in Caverns pent, And sounding Groves, He goes, and wond'ring hears The rumbling Billows; nor less wond'ring sees The various Streams, which subterraneous glide Thro' the vast Globe: Phasis, and Lycus' Source; And the deep Bed from which Enipeus bursts; And Father Tiberinus; and the Flood Of Anio; and of Hypanis, that roars Among the Rocks; Caicus too; and great Eridanus, bull-fac'd, with gilded Horns; Than whom no River, thro' the fertil Fields, Rushes more violent into the Sea. Soon as He came into his Mother's Grot Of hanging Pumice, and to Her reveal'd The Cause of his Complaints; The Sisters, rang'd, Pure Fountain-Water, and soft Towels bring; Some load the Boards with Viands, and full Bowls In order place: With rich Panchæan Sweets The Altars burn. Then Thus Cyrene; Take These Goblets of Mæonian Wine; From These To Ocean let us pour Libations due. Thus having spoke, Herself to Ocean prays, Parent of Things; and to her Sister Nymphs, Who o'er an hundred Groves, and Streams preside. Thrice on the Fire she sprinkled limpid Wine; Thrice to the Roof up-sprung the bright'ning Flame: Encourag'd by which Omen, Thus she spoke. In the Carpathian Gulph there dwells a Seer, Cerulean Proteus; who with two-legg'd Steeds, In Harness join'd, and of the finny Race, O'er the vast Main his bounding Chariot drives. He to Emathia, and his Native Coast Pallene now repairs: Him all We Nymphs, And aged Nereus' self, regard with Awe: For all things He, Past, Present, and To come, Prophetick knows: Such is great Neptune's Will; Whose monstrous Herds He feeds, beneath the Deep, The unform'd Phocæ. Him, my Son, in Bonds Thou must surprize; that All He may unfold, The Cause, and Cure of This contagious Ill. But without Force he Nothing will disclose; Nor can Intreaties move him: Force, and Chains Thou must apply, and captivate the God; These will, at length, confound his baffled Wiles. My self, when Sol in his Meridian burns, When the Grass thirsts, and Cattle most enjoy The cooling Shade, will bring thee to his Cave, Whither the Senior from the Sea retires Fatigu'd; that, while he sleeping lies, with ease Thou may'st invade him. But when round him clasp'd Thy Arms, and Chains, shall hold him strait confin'd; Then various Shapes of Beasts, illusive Forms, Will cheat thy Sight: For sudden He'll appear A horrid Tyger, and a bristly Boar, A scaly Dragon, and a Lion fierce Shaking his tawny Main; or roll like Fire With dreadful Noise, and so escape thy Toyls; Or, liquify'd to Water, glide away. But still the more he shifts; the more, my Son, Strain thou, and closer draw th'involving Net: 'Till such, rechang'd, he shall appear, as first Thou saw'st him, when his Eyes in Slumber clos'd. She said; and o'er her Son Ambrosial Oils And liquid Sweets diffus'd: His fragrant Hair Breaths rich Perfume; and Vigour to his Limbs Is added. In a hollow Mountain's Side Eaten with Age, there is a spacious Cave; Whither much Sea, driv'n by the Wind, retires, And cuts it self into a crooked Bay: A Station apt for Sailors caught in Storms. Here Proteus dwells, behind a massy Rock Roll'd on the Cavern's Mouth: Cyrene Here Places the Youth secluded from the Light; Herself, obscure in Clouds, aloof retires. Now torrid Sirius from the Zenith scorch'd The thirsty Indians; and the fiery Sun Parch'd the mid Globe; The with'ring Herbage burn'd; The fervid Rays the shallow Rivers dry'd, And in their empty Chanels bak'd the Mud; When Proteus, as accustom'd, from the Sea To his known Grot repair'd: His humid Flocks, The mighty Ocean's Offspring, round him play; And from their Sides shake off the briny Dew: The Phocæ, scatter'd, sleep along the Shore. Himself (like One who on the Mountains tends His Herd at Eve, when Vesper's Star recalls The Bullocks Home from Feeding, and the Lambs With Bleatings whet the Hunger of the Wolves) Sits, in the Centre, on a Rock; and counts Their Number. Aristæus, having gain'd This wish'd Occasion, e'er the aged Sire Could quite compose his weary Limbs to Rest, Swift rushes on him, with a mighty Shout; And, as he slumbers, seizes him in Chains. The Other, not unmindful of his Art, Into all wond'rous Shapes himself transforms; Grins horrible, and roars, a savage Beast; Flows as a River's Stream; and rolls in Fire. But when by no delusive Shifts, or Wiles, He could escape, He to Himself return'd; And Thus, at length, in human Accent spoke. Say, who advis'd thee, most presumptuous Youth, T'approach my Dwelling? Or What wouldst thou Here? Then He; You know it, Proteus: You by None Can be deceiv'd: O! would You not deceive! Warn'd by the Gods I come; and here implore Your Oracle, my Losses to repair. He said; The Seer, at length, with mighty Force Roll'd his green Eyes, that flash'd with darted Fires; Fierce gnash'd his Teeth, and Thus disclos'd the Fates. Thee some Immortal Pow'r with Wrath pursues; Vengeance o'ertakes thy Crimes: This Punishment Orpheus, unhappy by no Guilt of His, Procures for Thee, (a Penance more severe, Did not the Fates oppose, Thou wouldst sustain;) And sorely rages for his ravish'd Bride. She, doom'd to Death, while, heedless, Thee she fled, Along the River's side, before her Steps, In the high Grass, saw not the monstrous Snake, Which unperceiv'd lay lurking on the Bank. But all the beauteous Quire of Woodland Nymphs, Her Fellows, fill'd with Shrieks the lofty Hills; The Rhodopëian Mountains wept; and high Pangæa's Rock; and Rhesus' Martial Land, The Getæ, Hebrus, Actian Orithyia. He, with his concave Shell his pining Love Consol'd; and lonely, on the desart Shore, Thee, sweet Eurydice, Thee still he sung, Thee, at the Op'ning, Thee at Close of Day. Ev'n thro' the Jaws of Tænarus he pass'd, The subterranean Gates of Dis; and went To the dark Grove where gloomy Horrour reigns, The Manes, the tremendous King, and Souls Indocile to relent at human Pray'rs. Sooth'd by his Songs, from Erebus profound Th'unbody'd Fantoms, and thin Spectres rose; Unnumber'd, as the Birds which flock in Woods, Driv'n from the Hills by Ev'ning, or a Storm: Matrons, and Men, Souls of brave Heroes dead, Boys, and unmarry'd Girls, and Youths consum'd On Fun'ral Piles before their Parents' Eyes. Whom the black Mud of thick Cocytus' Pool, And it's unsightly Reeds, encompass round; And Styx, unlovely Lake, with sluggish Waves Hems in, and nine times interfus'd confines. Ev'n Death's dread Realms, the deep Recess of Hell, In silent Wonder listen'd to his Song; And with blue curling Snakes the Furies wreath'd; Grim Cerb'rus, yawning, his three Mouths repress'd; And with the Wind Ixion's Orb stood still. And now Eurydice, all Dangers pass'd, Returning, came restor'd to upper Life; Following behind; For Proserpine had giv'n That Law: When suddenly a Frenzy seiz'd Th'unwary Lover; yet a venial Crime, Could aught be venial, when the Manes judge: He stood; and now, ev'n on the Verge of Light, Ah! thoughtless, and by Force of mighty Love O'erpower'd, on his Eurydice look'd back. There all his Labour vanish'd into Air, Unravell'd; Violated was the Law, Which Hell's inexorable King impos'd: And thrice amidst the Acherontic Waves A Shout was heard. She; Who, my Orpheus, Who Has Me unfortunate, and Thee undone? What Fury This? Again the cruel Fates Remand me back; Sleep seals my swimming Eyes; And now Farewel: With Darkness round inclos'd I fleet away; and vainly stretch to Thee (Ah! now no longer Thine) These helpless Hands. She said; and from his Sight, like Smoke dispers'd Thro' the thin Air, flew diverse; Nor by Him, Grasping at Shades in vain, and thousand Things To say desiring, was e'er after seen: Nor would the Ferryman of Hell permit That He again should pass the dreary Stream. What should he do; his Love twice snatch'd away? Or whither turn him? With what Tears, what Songs, Should He attempt to move th'Infernal Pow'rs? She, shiv'ring, in the Stygian Sculler sail'd: He, sev'n whole Months, 'tis said, beneath a bleak Aërial Cliff, on Strymon's desart Bank, Wept lonesome; and in freezing Caves revolv'd This mournful Tale; while crouding Oaks admir'd His Lays, and Tygers soften'd at the Sound. As when, complaining in melodious Groans, Sweet Philomel, beneath a Poplar Shade, Mourns her lost Young; which some rough Village-Hind Observing, from their Nest, unfledg'd, has stole: She weeps all Night; and, perch'd upon a Bough, With plaintive Notes repeated fills the Grove. No proffer'd Loves, no Hymeneal Vows Could move his Soul: The Hyperborean Ice, And snowy Tanais, and th'extended Fields For ever rigid with Ripbæans Frost, Alone He travell'd o'er; Eurydice Ravish'd away, and Pluto's frustrate Grant Deploring. Which Contempt the Thracian Dames With Rage resenting, tore the hapless Youth, At Bacchus' Orgies, and nocturnal Rites; And strew'd his mangled Carcass o'er the Plains. Then too, his Head, from the fair Neck disjoin'd, Oeagrian Hebrus in his gulphy Tide Rolling along, Eurydice he call'd, With his last Accents, and his cooling Tongue; Ah! poor Eurydice, his flying Breath, Eurydice, the Stream, and Banks resound. Thus Proteus spoke: then plung'd into the Deep; And curl'd the foaming Billows round his Head. Not so Cyrene; She with healing Words Consol'd the trembling Youth: 'Tis giv'n thee Now, My Son, to banish these perplexing Cares. Of Thy Disaster This is all the Cause. The Nymphs, whose Dances in the secret Groves Eurydice frequented, to thy Swarms Have This deplorable Destruction sent: Do Thou to Them, with due Oblations paid, For Pardon sue, and supplicant adore The easy Dryades: For They, invok'd, Will grant That Pardon, and remit their Rage. But by what Means thou may'st appease them, first I will unfold. Select four stately Steers Of beauteous Form, which now thy Pastures graze On green Lycæus' Top; and with them join As many Heifers which ne'er felt the Yoke. For These, four Altars, in the lofty Fanes, Which to Those Nymphs are consecrated, build; From the stab'd Victims pour the holy Blood, And leave their Bodies in the shady Grove. When the Ninth Morn first rises on the World; To Orpheus solemn Fun'ral-Rites perform, And send Lethæan Poppies to his Ghost; Adore Eurydice with an Heifer slain, And a black Ewe, her Manes to appease: Then to the sacred Grove again repair. Forthwith his Mother's Orders he obeys; Comes to the Temples; as instructed, builds The Altars; to them brings four stately Steers, As many Heifers which ne'er felt the Yoke; When the Ninth Morn first rises on the World, To Orpheus solemn Fun'ral Rites performs; And to the sacred Grove again repairs. Here a surprizing Prodigy they see; For (wondrous to relate!) o'er all the Corps, And putrid Entrails of the Victims slain, Innumerable Bees, with humming Sound, Muster in Swarms, and burst the rotting Sides: Then form long Clouds, which swim in Air; at length On the high Trees alight; and hang conglob'd, In bellying Clusters, from the flexile Boughs. Thus have I sung of Tillage, and of Trees, And Culture apt for Cattle: While in Arms Great Cæsar thunders near Euphrates' Stream; Through all the willing World dispenses Laws, Victorious; and affects the Way to Heav'n. Me Virgil, at That time, the pleasing Soil Of sweet Parthenope refresh'd with Ease; Studious, and flourishing in silent Arts, Inglorious; who in daring Youth the Lays Of Shepherds play'd; and, Tityrus, thee sung Beneath the Covert of the Beechen Shade. The End of the Georgicks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[VOLS. II &amp; III.] ? Parnassia Laurus Parva sub ingenti Matris se subjicit umbrâ. Virg. VIRGIL's ÆNEIS. BOOK the First. Arms, and the Man I sing, who first from Troy Came to th'Italian, and Lavinian Shores, Exil'd by Fate; Much toss'd on Land, and Sea, By Pow'r Divine, and cruel Juno's Rage. Much too in War he suffer'd; 'till he rear'd A City, and to Latium brought his Gods: Whence sprung the Latin Progeny, the Kings Of Alba, and the Walls of Tow'ring Rome. Say, Muse, the Cause; What God had he provok'd? Or wherefore did the angry Queen of Heav'n Involve a Hero fam'd for Piety In such a Round of Toils, such various Woe? Dwells so much Passion in Celestial Minds? Fronting th'Italian Coast, and Tyber's Mouth, But far remote, an ancient City stood, Carthage its Name, a Colony of Tyre, Mighty in Wealth, and rough in study'd War. This, above all, was Juno's darling Seat, Ev'n more than Samos lov'd; Here lay her Arms, And Chariot: This ev'n Then, would Fate permit, For Universal Empire she design'd. But she had heard a Race from Trojan Blood Descended, should o'erturn her Tyrian Tow'rs; A People ruling wide, and proud in War, Should ravage Libya: So the Fates decreed. This fear'd Saturnia, bearing still in Mind The late, long War, which first she wag'd at Troy, For her own Argos, and her Fav'rite Greeks. Nor were as yet the Causes of her Rage, And keen Resentments, by her restless Soul Forgotten; Deep within her Bosom lay The Judgment giv'n by Paris, and th'Affront Of her scorn'd Beauty; The detested Race, And ravish'd Ganymede, so high advanc'd. By These Incentives fir'd, from Latium far She drove the Trojans, Relicks of the Greeks, And merciless Achilles, o'er the Sea Dispers'd; And urg'd by Fate, for many Years, They wander'd all th'extended Ocean round: So vast the Work to raise the Roman State! Scarce losing Sight of Sicily, with Joy They spred their Canvass; and with brazen Beaks Plough'd the salt Foam: When Juno, in her Breast Vindictive feeding an eternal Wound, Thus with herself. And must I then desist Baffled? Nor can I back from Latium turn This Trojan Prince? Belike, the Fates forbid. Could Pallas drown the Greeks, and burn their Fleet, For Ajax' Frenzy? For the Guilt of One? She, darting from the Clouds Jove's rapid Fire, Scatter'd their Ships, and rous'd the Sea with Winds: Him from his Breast expiring sulph'rous Flames She hurry'd in a Whirlwind, and transfix'd Upon a pointed Rock. But I, the Queen Of Gods, the Sister, and the Wife of Jove, With This one Race so many Years make War: And who will Juno's Deity adore Henceforth? Or Honour on my Altars lay? Such Thoughts revolving in her fiery Breast Alone, the Goddess to Æolia comes, The Land of Storms; where struggling Gusts of Air Engender: Here, in his capacious Cave, Great Æolus with absolute Command Controuls, imprisons, and confines in Chains The noisy Tempests, and reluctant Winds. They roar, and murmur round the Mountain's sides, Indignant: Æolus his Scepter shakes, Majestick on his lofty Throne, o'er-rules Their wild Desires, and moderates their Rage. Which did he not, with rapid Force they'd hurl Heav'n, Earth, and Seas, and sweep them thro' the Air. But fearing This, the Sov'reign of the Gods Pent them in gloomy Caves, and o'er them threw Vast Piles of massy Rocks; impos'd a King, Who should by certain Measures know to curb, Or, when commanded, to indulge their Rage. To whom then Juno Thus in suppliant Words Her Suit address'd. O Æolus, (for Thee The Sire of Gods and King of Men impow'rs To smooth the Waves, or raise them with the Wind;) A Race my Foe steers o'er the Tuscan Sea, Transporting Ilium, and their vanquish'd Gods To Italy: Add Fury to thy Winds; O'erwhelm in Ocean, or disperse their Fleet; And scatter all their Bodies o'er the Main. Twice sev'n bright Nymphs I have; of whom to Thee The fairest Deiopeia I will bind In Wedlock firm, and consecrate her Thine: Who, all her Days, such Merit shall reward; And make thee Parent of a beauteous Race. To whom the Monarch of the Winds reply'd. Be it your Care, illustrious Queen, to think What to command; my Task is to obey. You This my Kingdom, and Jove's Favour give; You raise me to the Banquets of the Gods; And o'er These Storms and Tempests make me Lord. Thus having spoke, He turn'd his Spear; and push'd The hollow Mountain's side: Out rush the Winds, Thronging, where way they find; with giddy Whirls Scour o'er the Lands, and then with Fury fall Upon the Sea: East, South, and stormy West, Together, from its lowest Caverns rouse The Deep; and roll vast Billows to the Shore. Cracking of Cordage, and the Cries of Men Succeed: By sudden Clouds the Heav'ns and Day Are ravish'd from the Trojans' Eyes; Dun Night Lies hov'ring o'er the Sea: Loud Thunder rocks The Poles; The Sky with nimble Lightning glares; And ev'ry Object threatens present Death. Æneas shudders, seiz'd with chilling Fear; Deeply he groans, lifts both his Hands to Heav'n, And Thus expostulates. Thrice happy They, Who chanc'd to die beneath Troy's lofty Walls, Before their Parents' Eyes! O Diomede, Thou bravest Chief of all the Grecian Race; Why could not I, in Trojan Fields, by Thee Breath out This Soul? Where by Achilles' Spear Stern Hector, where the great Sarpedon fell: Where Simois in his rapid Torrent rolls So many warriour Bodies, Helms, and Shields. Thus while he spoke; the Tempest from the North, Loud roaring, struck across his Sails, and toss'd The Billows to the Stars: The Oars are stav'd; The Prow inclines, and on the Surges lays Its side; a Mountain-Heap of Waves succeeds. On a high Surge These hang; to Those the Deep Yawning discloses Earth between the Waves: The boiling Tide ferments among the Sands. Three Notus, whirling, drives on hidden Rocks, Rocks in mid Sea, which Latins Altars call, A mighty Ridge of Stone above the Waves; Three Eurus from the Ocean (dreadful Sight!) Urges on Shelves, and Syrtes; There they stick Upon the Flats, inclos'd with Banks of Sand. One, which the Lycians, and Orontes bore, From Prow to Stern a mighty Billow strikes, Before his Eyes: The Master, swept from Deck, Rolls headlong; Her the circling Eddy thrice Works round, and swallows in the rapid Gulf. Scatter'd, and floating on the vast Abyss, Men, Arms, and Planks, and Trojan Wealth appear. Now Those strong Ships, in which Ilioneus, And Abas, and the brave Achates sail'd, And old Alethes, by the Storm subdu'd, Shatter'd, and leaking with disjointed Ribs, At gaping Chinks admit the hostile Flood. Mean-while the Noise and Tumult of the Main Neptune perceives; the Bottom of the Deep Turn'd upwards; and the Storm's licentious Rage. Highly provok'd, and careful for his Realms, Above the Waves, serene, he rears his Head; He sees the Trojan Fleet o'er all the Sea Dispers'd; Æneas, and his Ships o'erpow'r'd With Surges, and the Ruin of the Sky. Nor were his Sister's Wiles, and Hate unknown: East, and West Winds he hails; and then proceeds. From your high Birth does This Presumption rise? And dare you thus, without my Sov'reign Leave, Mix Earth, and Heav'n, and such vast Billows raise? Whom I—But first 'tis fit we should compose The troubled Ocean: For your next Offence A more severe Correction you shall find. Hence, fly; and bear this Message to your King: To Me, not Him, the Empire of the Main, And awful Trident fell: Huge rocky Caves Are his Dominions; Eurus, your Abodes: Proud in That Palace Æolus may reign; But bid him bar the Prison of his Winds. So spoke the God; and sooner than He spoke, Appeas'd the Tossing of the Waves, dispell'd The Clouds collected, and restor'd the Sun. Cymothoe too, and Triton join their Strength To clear the Vessels from the pointed Rock: Himself his Trident plys, to heave them off, Levels the Banks of Sand, and calms the Sea, And with light Wheels o'er the smooth Surface rides. As when Sedition oft in populous Towns Is rais'd, and fierce th'ignoble Vulgar storm; Now Stones, and Firebrands fly; Rage Arms supplies: If chance they then espy a Sage, rever'd For Piety, and Worth; All silent stand, List'ning with Ears attentive: With his Words He rules their Passion, and their Heat allays. So all the Hurry of the Ocean ceas'd, Soon as its God appear'd above the Waves; Who, managing his Steeds in Air serene, Flys swift with slacken'd Reins, and loose Carrier. The weary Trojans strive with speed to gain The nearest Shore, and stand for Libya's Coast. There lies an Harbour in a long Recess: An Island forms it with opposing Sides; 'Gainst which the Water from the Ocean breaks, And cuts itself into a winding Bay. On each side, mighty Rocks; Above the rest Two threaten Heav'n; beneath whose Brows the Sea In safety sleeps: A trembling silvan Scene Hangs from the Top, imbrown'd with gloomy Shade. Full opposite, a Cave with pendant Rocks; Within, fresh Springs, and Seats of living Stone, The Naiads' Grot: The weary Vessels here No Cable holds, nor biting Anchor moors. Hither Æneas turns, from all his Fleet Sev'n Ships collecting; and with Love of Land Eager, the Trojans gain the welcome Shore, And rest their brine-drench'd Limbs upon the Beach. Here first from Flints Achates struck a Spark; Inclos'd the Fire in Leaves, and round it pil'd Dry Fuel; and blew up the sudden Flame. Then, tir'd with Toil, Provision marr'd and dank, And Instruments of Ceres they produce; Corn rescu'd from the Wreck they then prepare To grind with Stones, and bake upon the Fire. Mean-while Æneas climbs a Rock, and all The Prospect o'er the spacious Main commands; If Antheus, or the Phrygian Gallies there, Toss'd by the Wind, or Capys he might spy, Or on the lofty Deck Caicus' Arms. No Sail in view; Three Stags upon the Shore Wand'ring he sees: Them follow'd all the Herd Behind, and browzing stray'd along the Vales. Stopping, he snatch'd his Arrows swift of flight, And Bow, the Weapons which Achates bore; And first the Leaders, bearing high their Heads With branching Horns, upon the Ground extends. The Vulgar next with undistinguish'd Shafts He wounds, among the leafy Woods; nor ceas'd, 'Till on the Turf sev'n lofty Deer he laid, The number of his Vessels. To the Port He then returns, and with his gen'ral Crew The Booty shares: Wine laid on Board in Casks, Which, at their Parting, on Sicilia's Shore, The good Acestes gave, he then divides; And with These Words revives their drooping Cheer. O Friends, (for long experienc'd in Distress We suffer) greater Ills you have sustain'd; To These a Period will be fix'd by Heav'n. You Scylla's Rage, and dreadful sounding Rocks Have safe approach'd, and seen the Cyclops' Caves: Recall your Courage, banish anxious Fear; These Dangers too perhaps in future Times With Joy we shall revolve. Thro' various Toils, Thro' all These Hazards we to Latium steer; There Destiny will peaceful Mansions give, And there Troy's Kingdom is allow'd to rise. Endure; reserve yourselves for better Fate. Thus He, tho' lab'ring with prodigious Woe, Yet smooths his Looks; and with dissembled Hope Deep burys huge Affliction in his Breast. They to their future Feast themselves address, Flea off the Skins, and lay the Entrails bare; Some cut them into Joints, and spit the Limbs Yet quiv'ring; Some place Cauldrons on the Shore, And kindled Fires apply: With plenteous Meal They then resume their Strength; and on the Grass, Fill'd with old Wine, and well-fed Ven'son, lie. Their Hunger now appeas'd, with long Discourse Next for their lost Companions they enquire; Doubtful 'twixt Hope, and Fear, if yet they liv'd, Or bore the last Extremes, nor heard the Call Of Friends invoking their departed Ghosts. Above the rest, the pious Trojan Prince Now brave Orontes with himself bewails; Now Amycus, and Lycus' cruel Fate, And Gyas, and Cloanthus, valiant Chiefs. Now all was ended; when Imperial Jove Surveying, from the Summit of the Sky, The navigable Seas, and low laid Earth, And Shores, and Nations wide, on Heav'n's high Tow'r, Stood, and on Libya's Kingdoms fix'd his Eyes. To Him, such Cares revolving in his Breast, Sad Venus, her bright Eyes all drown'd in Tears, Suppliant applies. O Thou, whose Sov'reign Pow'r Controuls th'Affairs of Men, and Gods, with Rule Eternal; and with Thunder awes; 'Gainst You What Crime so great could my Æneas act, Or what the Trojans? By so many Deaths Destroy'd, for Latium's sake must they be barr'd From all the World beside? You promis'd sure, That, in the Course of rolling Years, from Them The Romans should descend, and Leaders sprung From Teucer's Blood restor'd; who Land and Sea With universal Empire should possess: Why, Sov'reign Father, is your Purpose chang'd? Sooth'd by That Hope, I soften'd the harsh Doom Of ruin'd Troy, and ballanc'd Fates with Fates. Now the same Fortune persecutes them still, Long toss'd by such variety of Storms: What End, great Monarch, shall their Labours find? Antenor, from amidst the Greeks escap'd, Could penetrate th'Illyrian Bay, and reach Liburnia's inmost Realms, and safe o'er-pass Timavus' Head; whence thro' Nine Mouths he rolls, (The Mountain murm'ring loud) himself a Sea, And with a roaring Deluge drowns the Fields. Yet Padua here He built, a Seat of Troy, New nam'd the Nation, fix'd his Trojan Arms; Now rests secure, compos'd in pleasing Peace. We your own Race, by you advanc'd to Heav'n, Losing our Vessels, for the Spight of One, (Unworthy Treatment!) are betray'd, and driv'n Far from th'Italian Coasts. Is Virtue Thus Rewarded? Are our Sceptres Thus restor'd? Smiling on Her, the Sire of Men and Gods, With That smooth Look which clears the stormy Sky, His Daughter gently kiss'd, and Thus reply'd. Fear not my Cytherea; Still remain Your Trojans Fates unmov'd: You shall behold That City, and Lavinium's promis'd Walls; And brave Æneas to the Stars of Heav'n Shall raise aloft: Nor is my Purpose chang'd. He (for, because This Care disturbs your Breast, The Scheme of Fate's dark Volumes I'll unfold) In Italy shall wage a mighty War, Make stubborn Nations bend beneath his Arms, And Walls, and Manners to the Vanquish'd give. Three Years entire in Latium he shall reign; The curb'd Rutulians yielding to his Sway. But young Ascanius, now Iülus call'd, (Ilus he was, when Ilium's Empire stood) Twice fifteen Suns, shall govern; and transfer The Kingdom from Lavinium's Seat, and found Long Alba with prodigious Strength secur'd. Here full three hundred Years th'Hectorean Race Sov'reign shall wield the Sceptre; 'till at last Ilia the Royal Priestess, big by Mars, A twin Birth shall disclose: Hence Romulus, Nurs'd by a Wolf, and in her tawny Hide Exulting, shall succeed to rule the State, Form a new Nation, build Mavortian Walls; And, from Himself, the Name of Romans give. To These I fix no Bounds of Place, or Time, But endless Empire grant: Ev'n She, who now Embroils with anxious Fear Heav'n, Earth, and Seas, Ev'n sullen Juno then shall bend her Thoughts To better Counsels, and with me promote Rome's lordly Sons, the Nation of the Gown. So 'tis decreed: An Age in circling Months Shall come, when old Assaracus's Race Phthia, and fam'd Mycenæ shall enslave, And absolute o'er conquer'd Argos reign. Cæsar from Troy's illustrious Blood shall rise; The Sea shall bound his Empire, Heav'n his Fame: Julius! a Name from great Iülus sprung! Him laden with his Eastern Spoils in Heav'n Secure you shall receive: Religious Vows To Him shall be directed. Ages mild Shall next succeed, and War no more be heard; Then Faith, and Vesta, and Quirinus, join'd With Remus, shall give Laws: Strong massy Bars, And Bolts of solid Iron, fast shall close War's dreadful Portals; Impious Rage within Sitting on horrid Armour, and behind Bound with an hundred brazen Knots, shall roar With bloody Mouth, and foaming bite his Chains. He said; and from the Sky sent Maia's Son, That Libya's Harbour, and new Carthage Gates Might open to the Trojans; left in Fate Dido unskill'd, should drive them from her Coasts. He by the airy Steerage of his Wings Shoots thro' the vast Expanse; and soon alighting On Libya, executes great Jove's Commands. The Tyrians, chang'd by Influence of the God, Forget their native Fierceness: More than all, Their Queen, to aid the Trojans well dispos'd, Forms hospitable Thoughts, and kind Designs. But good Æneas, various Cares all Night Revolving, soon as cheerful Morn appears, Resolves to walk abroad; and view the Coasts Unknown; to seek what Natives it contain'd, If Men, or Beasts; (for Desart all he sees) And to his Friends relate the Facts explor'd. His Navy in the Covert of the Woods He hides retir'd, beneath a hollow Rock, Fenc'd round with Trees, and gloomy Shade. Himself Attended only by Achates goes, Shaking two Jav'lins of broad-pointed Steel. Whom in a Wood's Recess his Mother meets; A Spartan Virgin's Mien, and Dress, and Arms Dissembling, or Harpalyce of Thrace, When Steeds she tires, and outstrips Hebrus' Stream. For (Huntress like) she had on her Shoulders hung A light, commodious Bow; and giv'n the Winds To wanton in her Tresses: Bare her Knee; And in a Knot her flowing Folds confin'd. And first; Ho! Youths, inform me, if you saw One of my Sisters wand'ring here, she cry'd, Girt with a Quiver, and a Lynx's Skin, And urging in loud Chace a foaming Boar. Thus Venus spoke; and thus her Son reply'd. None of your Sisters has been seen, or heard By me: To you what Name shall I apply, Celestial Maid? For heav'nly is your Face; Nor speaks your Voice a Mortal: Sure some Goddess; Diana? or a Nymph? Whoe'er you are, To us be kind, and ease us of our Toils; Instruct us on what Climate we are thrown: Unknowing of th'Inhabitants, and Coasts, We wander; hither driv'n by Winds and Waves: Our Victims shall before your Altars fall. Then Venus: I such Honour must refuse: The Tyrian Virgins (Such This Country's Mode) A Quiver wear; and high inclose their Legs In purple Buskins. Punick Realms you see, A Tyrian Colony, Agenor's Walls; But Libyan Territories, and a Race Rigid, and stern in War. Here Dido reigns, Flying her Brother, and escap'd from Tyre. Long is her Story; intricate her Wrongs: But Thus in brief. Sichæus was her Lord; Most wealthy in Phœnician Land, and lov'd With mighty Passion by his hapless Bride. Her Father, with the first connubial Rites Espousing, gave her spotless to his Bed: But on the Tyrian Throne her Brother sate, Pygmalion, monstrous, and renown'd in Vice Beyond all others whom fell Rage transports. He with the Sword in secresy surpriz'd Sichæus, and before his Altars slew, Impious, and blinded with the Love of Gold, Regardless of his Sister's Love; and long Conceal'd the Fact; and, with Pretences vain Dissembling, mock'd the pining Lover's Hopes. But in a Dream, with Visage wond'rous pale, The Ghost of her unbury'd Husband came; The cruel Altars, and his wounded Breast, And all the hidden Villany disclos'd: Warn'd her to fly her Country; and, to aid Her Flight, reveal'd a Treasure hid in Earth, An unknown Mass of Silver, and of Gold. Dido, o'ersway'd by This, provides for Flight; Prepares her Friends: Some Malecontents combine, All who abhor'd, or fear'd the Tyrant's Rage. Ships, which by Chance lay ready, strait they seize, And load with Gold; The greedy Monarch's Wealth Is o'er the Sea convey'd: A Woman guides The whole Affair. At last they hither came, Where now Those strong and stately Walls you'll see, And the high Turrets of new Carthage rise. There so much Land they bought, as one Bull's Hide Would compass; and the Name of Byrsa gave In Mem'ry of the Deed. But in your Turn At length inform me, Who, and Whence you are, And Whither bound. To Her the Trojan Prince, Deep groaning from the bottom of his Breast, Reply'd: O Goddess, should I from the first Original trace my Story, and had you Leisure to hear the Annals of our Woes; Ev'ning would close the Day, e'er all were told. We from old Troy, if haply such a Name Has reach'd your Ears, thro' various Seas are toss'd, And now by Tempest thrown on Libya's Shore. I am the good Æneas, known by Fame Above the Heav'ns; who rescu'd from the Foe, And carry in my Fleet, our Country Gods. The Land I seek, is Italy; and Jove The Author of my Birth. With twenty Ships I stem'd the Phrygian Sea; My promis'd Fates, And Goddess Mother were my Guides: Scarce sev'n Escap'd from Storms remain; My self unknown, And indigent, o'er Libya's Desarts rove, At once from Europe, and from Asia bar'd. Venus, no longer bearing his Complaint, Thus interrupts his Grief. Whoe'er you are, The Pow'rs Divine, I think, are not your Foes; Since at the Tyrian City you're arriv'd. But go, and to the Queen your self present. For that your Fleet, and Friends, by changing Winds, Are safe, with Knowledge I pronounce; unless My Parents taught me Augury in vain. See These twelve Swans, how they with joyful Clang Now flock Triumphant; whom the Bird of Jove, Stooping from his ethereal Seat, dispers'd In open Air: Now in long Row they seem To chuse their Ground, or having chos'n it, view The Place with surer Ken: As These return'd On sounding Pinions play, and in a Throng Surround the Pole, and sing along the Sky; So all your Vessels, and your absent Friends, Now ride in Harbour; or with swelling Sails Steer full into the Channel: But proceed, And, as That Path directs, pursue your Way. She said; And, as she turn'd, her rosy Neck Shone bright; Her Hair a Fragrancy divine Ambrosial breath'd; Down flows her waving Robe, And by her Walk the Goddess moves confess'd. He, when he knew his Mother, with such Sounds Pursu'd her, as she fled: And why so oft With borrow'd Shapes do You too mock your Son, Ah! cruel? Why is it deny'd to join Our Hands, and real Accents hear, and speak? Complaining Thus, he to the Town proceeds. But Venus, as they went, around them threw A cloudy Mantle, made of Air condens'd; That unmolested they might pass, unseen, And none with Questions interrupt their Haste. Her self to Paphos goes sublime, and pleas'd Visits her Seat; where sacred to her stands A Temple; with Sabæan Incense smoke An hundred Altars, and fresh Garlands breath. They by the Path's direction urge their Way; And now ascend the Hill, whose jutting Front Hangs o'er the Town, and from above surveys, It's adverse Tow'rs. Amaz'd Æneas stands To see an ample City, where before Low Cottages appear'd; and wond'ring views The Gates, the Streets, and Hurry of the Place. The Tyrians urge their Work; some raise the Walls, Roll pond'rous Stones, and form the Cittadel: Some mark out Ground for Houses with the Plough; Laws, Judges, and an awful Senate chuse. Others dig Ports; Some deep Foundations lay For Theatres, and Pillars hew from Rocks, The stately Ornaments of future Scenes. Such Toil employs the Bees in Summer's Prime, Amidst the flow'ry Fields, and sunny Air; When they disburthen their o'erpeopled Realms, Or work the liquid Sweets, and stretch their Cells With luscious Nectar; or unlade their Friends Returning; or in Troops beat off the Drones, A lazy Cattle: Hot the Work proceeds, And sweet with Thyme the fragrant Honey smells. O happy These, whose Walls already rise! Said the brave Prince, and looking up survey'd The lofty Turrets: In a Cloud conceal'd (Wond'rous to tell) he passes thro' the Midst, And mingling with the Croud is seen by None. Full in the Centre stood a shady Grove; Where first the Tyrians, toss'd by Waves and Winds, Digging, an Omen found, which Juno shew'd, A sprightly Horse's Head: 'Twas hence foretold, The Nation should thro' Ages be renown'd For War, and Conquest. Here the Tyrian Queen To Juno built a stately Temple, rich With Gifts, and by the present Goddess bless'd. To which on Steps the brazen Thresholds rose; The Beams were bound with Brass; the brazen Doors Jarr'd on their Hinges. First within This Grove An unexpected Sight abates their Fear; Here first Æneas Confidence resumes, And better Hopes for his distress'd Affairs. For while the spacious Temple he surveys Curious, and waits the Coming of the Queen; While he admires the Fortune of the Place, The busy Lab'rers, and their mutual Toil: The Trojan Battles he in order sees, Wars spred by Fame already o'er the World: Atrides, Priam, and severe to Both Achilles. Fix'd he stood, and weeping cry'd, What Place, Achates, in the Universe, What Region now abounds not with our Woes? See Priam; Virtue here has it's Reward; Ev'n here Compassion reigns, and human Minds Are touch'd with human Mis'ry: Banish Fear, This Fame will give thee some Relief. He said; And with an empty Picture fed his Soul, Deep groaning, and o'erwhelm'd his Face with Tears. For there he saw, how fighting round the Walls Here fled the Greeks, the Trojan Youth pursu'd; The Trojans there gave way; Achilles high Plum'd in his Chariot rode, and urg'd their Flight. Not far from hence, by snow-white Banners known, The Tents of Rhesus weeping he beholds; Which, in the first Repose by Night betray'd, Tydides plunder'd, and with Slaughter fill'd, And drove away the fiery Steeds, before They tasted Trojan Grass, or Xanthus' Stream. Here Troïlus in flight, depriv'd of Arms, (Ill-fated Youth!) was by the Horses drawn, Unequally with great Achilles match'd: He to the empty Chariot clings supine, Yet holds the Reins; His Head along the Ground Is dragg'd: The Spear inverted scrawls the Dust. Mean-while to unappeas'd Minerva's Fane The Trojan Dames in sad Procession went, Beating their Breasts, and with dishevel'd Hair; And bore a Veil: She fix'd her Eyes on Earth, Averse. Achilles round the Trojan Walls Thrice Hector whirl'd, and sold his breathless Trunk. Deeply He sigh'd; when he the Chariot saw, The Spoils, and ev'n the Body of his Friend, And Priam stretching out his suppliant Hands. Himself he knew mix'd with the Grecian Chiefs; The Eastern Troops; and swarthy Memmon's Arms. Her Amazonian Files with lunar Shields Penthesilea leads, and in the Midst Of Thousands storms; Beneath her naked Pap Her golden Belt she buckles, warlike Maid, And, tho' a Virgin, dares engage with Men. This while the Trojan Prince with wonder sees Amaz'd, and in one Posture musing stands; Up to the Temple moves the beauteous Queen, Dido, surrounded with a Troop of Guards: As on Eurotus' Banks, or Cynthus' Top, Diana leads her Train; A thousand Nymphs Enclose her round; Her self her Quiver bears High on her Shoulder, and with stately-Walk O'erlooks them all: A secret Pleasure slides Along Latona's Breast. Such Dido was, So smiling thro' the Croud she pass'd, intent Upon their Labours, and her future Realms. Then in the Entrance of the Dome, beneath The Middle of the Temple's Arch, she sate, Fenc'd round with Arms; and, on her Throne aloft Leaning Majestick, to her Subjects gave Commands, and Laws; and measur'd out their Tasks In equal Portions; or by Lot assign'd. When suddenly Æneas in the Croud Antheus, Sergestus, and Cloanthus saw; With other Trojans, whom the boist'rous Storm Had toss'd at Sea, and driv'n on other Coasts. Amaz'd himself, amaz'd Achates stood, Eager, 'twixt Joy and Fear, to join their Hands; But the unknown Event confounds their Thoughts. They wait, and muffled in their Cloud, observe The Fortune of their Friends; upon what Coast They left the Fleet; and what should be the Cause Of their Arrival: For from all the Ships Some chosen came, imploring to be heard, And with a Clamour to the Temple press'd. Admission being gain'd, and Leave to speak; Ilioneus, their Chief, with pleasing Grace Began. O Queen, whom Jove impow'rs to build This recent City, and with Laws to curb Proud Nations; We, the poor Remains of Troy, Driv'n thro' all Seas by Winds, implore you: Save Our Vessels from inhospitable Fires: Pity a pious Race; with nearer View Consider our Affairs. We came not here, To ravage with the Sword your Libyan Stores, Or lade our Ships with Pillage from the Town; Such hostile Force, such Insolence of Thought, Ill suits, alas! the State of vanquish'd Men. There is a Place by Greeks Hesperia call'd, An ancient Land, renown'd in Arms, and rich In fertil Glebe; th'Oenotrians once possess'd, And till'd the Soil; the Moderns now, 'tis said, Have from their Chief the Land Italia nam'd. Hither we steer'd our Course: When on a sudden, rising with a Storm, Boistrous Orion drove us on the Flats, And hidden Shelves; and with capricious Winds Scatter'd us o'er the Waves, the foamy Deep, And Rocks unpassable: We few escap'd From Shipwreck to your Coasts. What Race of Men Is This? What barb'rous Country, that permits Such Customs? From the Refuge of the Strand They drive us, offer War, and beat us back From the first Shore. If Human Kind you scorn, And mortal Arms; Expect, at least, the Gods Will have a due Regard to Right, and Wrong. Æneas was our Prince; than whom more just Was none, nor more renown'd in War and Arms. Whom if the Fates preserve; if vital Air He breaths, nor mingles with the ruthless Shades; No more of Fear: Nor shall you e'er repent Of having first oblig'd: Sicilia too Has Arms for Us, and Cities, and the King Acestes, sprung from Troy's illustrious Blood. Let us have Leave to draw our Fleet ashore, Shatter'd by Winds; and from the Woods refit Our Planks, and Oars: That joyful we may steer To Latium; if 'tis giv'n us e'er to find Our Prince, and Friends, and thither bend our Course. But if, all Safety lost, the Libyan Waves Thee, Father of the Trojans, have devour'd, And no more Hope of young Iülus left; We to Sicanian Seas, at least, and Seats Prepar'd, from whence we're hither driv'n by Winds, And to the King Acestes may repair. So spake Ilioneus; the Trojans all Murmur'd unanimous. Dido with down-cast Looks in brief replies. Trojans, dismiss your Doubts, seclude your Cares: My difficult Affairs, and infant State Force me to take such Measures, and secure My Frontiers with a Guard: Th'Æneian Race Who knows not, and the valiant Sons of Troy, And wasteful Rage of so renown'd a War? Not so obtuse are our Phœnician Breasts; Nor rises Phœbus so averse from Tyre. Whether for wide Hesperia, and the Fields Of Saturn, you design; or Eryx' Coasts, And King Acestes: I'll dismiss you safe With my Assistance, and supply'd with Wealth. Or would you settle in These Realms with Me? Yours is my City; draw your Ships ashore: Trojan, and Tyrian shall from me receive Treatment alike. And I could wish your Prince, Æneas too, were here himself arriv'd, By the same Tempest driv'n: Nay, I will send To search the Coasts of Libya, and explore It's utmost Bounds; if haply, thrown on Land, He in some Wood, or unknown City, strays. Exalted by These Words, the Trojan Prince, And brave Achates, eager long'd to burst The Cloud; Achates first bespeaks the Prince. What, Goddess-born, are now your Thoughts? And what Do you resolve? All safe you see; our Fleet, And Friends restor'd: One missing, whom ourselves Saw drown'd: The rest confirms your Mother's Words. He scarce had spoke; When strait the ambient Cloud Dissolves itself, and rarifies to Air. Confess'd Æneas stood; and shone in Light Serene, in Shape and Features, like a God: For Venus with the rosy Bloom of Youth Had flush'd her Son, with graceful Locks adorn'd, And breath'd a sparkling Lustre on his Eyes. Such is the Beauty, which the Artist's Hand To polish'd Iv'ry lends: So Silver shines, Or Parian Stone, enchas'd in yellow Gold. Then sudden, and surprizing All, he Thus Bespeaks the Queen. Behold the Man you seek, Trojan Æneas, sav'd from Libyan Waves. O You, who only with Compassion see Troy's endless Toils, receive us for Allies, And in This City yield a safe Retreat To Us, the Relicks of the Greeks fatigu'd With all the Hazards of the Land, and Sea, Of all things indigent: Due Thanks to pay Is not in Us, nor whatsoe'er remains Of Trojan Race dispers'd thro' all the World. The Gods to you (if Virtue be their Care, And any Justice yet remain) the Gods, And your own Mind self-conscious of the Right, Equal Rewards shall give. What Age so bless'd Gave Birth to such a Princess? and from what Illustrious, happy Parents are you sprung? While Rivers seek the Sea, while Shades surround The Mountains' Sides, while Ether feeds the Stars; Your Honour, Name, and Praise shall ever live; Me whate'er Soil invites. This said, he greets With his Right hand Ilioneus his Friend, Serestus with the Left; then all the rest; Brave Gyas, and Cloanthus, valiant Chief. Dido at first astonish'd at the Sight, Then at th'Adventures of the wond'rous Man, Thus speaks: What Fate pursues you, Goddess-born, Thro' such Variety of Toils? What Pow'r Drives you on barb'rous Coasts? Are You That fam'd Æneas, whom on Phrygian Simois' Banks Indulgent Venus to Anchises bore? Nay I remember Teucer came to Sidon, Driv'n from his Country, and new Kingdoms sought By Belus' Aid: My Father Belus then Wasted rich Cyprus, and, as Conqu'ror, rul'd, Already from That Time I know the Fate Of Troy, your Name, and all the Grecian Kings. He, tho' a Foe, with lavish Praise extol'd The Trojans, and would prove himself deriv'd From Trojan Blood. Come on then, gallant Guests, Enter my Palace: Toss'd thro' various Toils Me the like Destiny at length decreed To rest, and fix my Mansion in This Realm: Acquainted with Misfortune, I have learn'd To pity and to succour the Distress'd. This said; She leads Æneas to her Court, And to the Gods a Festival proclaims. Meanwhile to all the Crew, on board his Ships Which lay in Harbour, twenty Bulls she sends; An hundred bristly Boars with spacious Chines; An hundred fatted Lambs, with Ewes; and Wine, Gift of the jolly God. But with proud Pomp the inner Rooms of State Are splendidly adorn'd; and Feasts prepar'd In the mid Court: The purple Carpets wrought With Art; The Tables groan with massy Plate, And brave Exploits of warlike Ancestors Emboss'd in Gold; a long successive Train Of Actions, thro' so many Heroes drawn From the first Founder of the Royal Race. Æneas (for a Father's anxious Love Permits him not to rest) Achates sends Swift to the Ships, Ascanius to inform, And bring him to the City: On his Son All the fond Parent's Care is still employ'd. Some Presents too, from Ilion's Ruins sav'd, He bids him bring: a Robe all stiff with Gold, And Figures: and a Mantle woven round With saffron Foliage, Grecian Helen's Dress; Which, from Mycenæ, when she came to Troy, And unpermitted Hymenéal Rites, She brought, her Mother Leda's wond'rous Gift: A Sceptre too, which once Ilione, The eldest Daughter of King Priam, bore: A Necklace strung with Chains of orient Pearl: And a Crown, doubly set with Gems, and Gold. This to dispatch, away Achates flies. But Venus in her Breast new Plots revolves, Forms new Designs; that Cupid chang'd in Shape Should go for sweet Ascanius, and with Gifts Inflame the Queen; and with her Vitals blend His Fires: For much she dreads th'ambiguous Race, And double-talking Tyrians; Juno's Rage Torments her; and with Night her Care returns. To winged Love she therefore Thus applies. My Son, my Strength, my mighty Pow'r alone; My Son, who dost Typhæan Bolts defy Of Jove Supreme; Thee suppliant I address, Thy Deity implore. How round the Seas Your Brother is by Juno's Malice toss'd, You know; and oft have join'd your Tears with mine. Him now Phœnician Dido entertains, And sooths with Speeches bland; and much I fear What Juno's Hospitality designs: She in so great a Juncture will not rest. Wherefore I have contriv'd to countermine Their Projects, and involve the Queen in Flames; That by no Pow'r she may be chang'd, but love Æneas with a Fondness like my own. This how thou may'st effect, receive my Thoughts. The Royal Boy, my chief Concern, prepares To go to Carthage at his Father's Call, Bearing the Presents rescu'd from the Sea, And Flames of Troy: Him lull'd to Sleep I'll hide On high Cythera, or th'Idalian Hill, In sacred Privacy; lest he should know Our Fraud, or intervening marr the Plot. Thou for one Night, no more, assume his Looks, And take, thyself a Boy, his boyish Form. That, when amidst the Royal Feasts, and Wine, Dido shall hug thee on her Lap, and print Sweet Kisses; unperceiv'd thou may'st inspire Thy Flame, and slide thy Poison to her Heart. The God, complying with his Mother's Will, Throws off his Wings; and, joyful, trips along In young Iülus' Step. Him Venus lulls With dewy Sleep, and on her Bosom hush'd Carries him to Idalia's lofty Groves; Where blooming Jessamine around him breaths With Flow'rs, in fragrant Shade. Now Cupid goes Obsequious, with his Guide Achates pleas'd, And bears the Royal Presents to the Court. There when he came; upon the golden Couch, Sumptuous with Tapestry, the Queen had plac'd Herself, and in the Middle chose her Seat. Now Prince Æneas, and the Trojan Youth Advance; and feast, on crimson Beds repos'd. Th'Attendants wait with Water for the Hands, Distribute Bread from Canisters, and hold Soft Towels. Fifty Handmaids wait within, Dispose the Banquet in long order rang'd, And burn rich Incense to the Houshold-Gods. An hundred Maids besides, as many Youths, Of equal Age, attend; who pile the Boards With Dishes, and the Cups and Goblets place. Nor less the Tyrians croud the joyful Court, Invited on embroider'd Beds to feast. The Presents of Æneas all admire; Admire Iülus in the God disguis'd, His glowing Looks, and well dissembled Words, The Robe, and Veil with saffron Foliage wrought. Chiefly th'unhappy Queen, to future Rage Devoted, with insatiate Fondness burns, And passionately gazes; with the Boy, And with his Presents, equally inflam'd. He, having hung upon Æneas' Neck, And satisfy'd his fancy'd Father's Love, Goes to the Queen: She fixes all her Sight, And Soul upon him; sometimes on her Lap Fonds him; nor thinks how great a God she bears. He, mindful of his Mother, by degrees Begins t'expunge Sichæus from her Breast; And with a living Flame to prepossess Her Heart, long liftless, and unus'd to Love. The Banquet pausing, and the Meat remov'd; Large massy Bowls they place, and crown the Wine. Loud Noise succeeds; and thro' the ample Courts They roll the Sound: In Sconces Tapers hang Lighted from gilded Roofs; and Night retires, O'erpower'd with blazing Flambeaus. Here the Queen Calls for a Goblet, rough with Gems, and Gold, (Which Belus us'd, and all the Kings from Him,) And fills it up with Wine; then through the Court Silence commands. O Jove, (for Thou art said To fix the Laws of Hospitality) Grant that This Day auspicious may be prov'd To both the Colonies of Tyre, and Troy; And by our late Posterity be known. May Bacchus, God of Mirth, and Juno kind, Be present here: And you my Tyrians join, Well pleas'd, to celebrate the solemn Feast. This said, she for Libation spills the Wine Upon the Board: and first with gentle Touch Salutes the Cup; which, hast'ning him, she gives To Bitias: He with speed the frothy Bowl Drinks off, and swills himself with the full Gold. Then all the Lords: When curl'd Iöpas tun'd His golden Lyre, and sung what Atlas taught; The wand'ring Moon, the Labours of the Sun; Whence Men, and Beasts, whence Rain, and Light'nings come, The Constellations of the Northern Cars, Arcturus, and the show'ry Hyades: Why Suns, in Winter, haste so swift to tinge Themselves in Ocean; and what Cause retards The sluggish Nights. The Tyrians loud Acclaim Redouble; and the Trojan Guests concur. Mean-while th'unhappy Queen with various Talk Protracts the Night; and, deeply drinking Love, Of Priam much, of Hector much enquires: Now with what Arms Aurora's Offspring came; Now of Achilles, now of Diomede's Steeds. Nay come, she said, and tell us, Princely Guest; Ev'n from the first Original relate The Grecian Wiles; the Fortunes of your Friends; And your own Travels: For sev'n Summers now Have seen you wand'ring o'er all Lands, and Seas. The End of the First Book. BOOK the Second. All silent, list'ning sate; When Thus the Prince Æneas from the lofty Couch began. What you command, Great Queen, is to renew Unutterable Woes; How Greece o'erturn'd The Pow'r, and Realm deplorable of Troy: Woes, which myself beheld; of which myself Was one great Part. In op'ning such a Scene, What Myrmidon, what Soldier in the Camp Of dire Ulysses, could refrain from Tears? And now the dewy Night is hast'ning swift From Heav'n; and setting Stars persuade to Sleep. But if you have such strong Desire to learn Our great Misfortunes, and in brief to hear Of Troy's last Pangs in Ruin: Tho' my Mind Dreads the Remembrance, and shrinks back with Grief; I will begin. The Leaders of the Greeks Harrass'd with War, and by the Fates repuls'd, So many rolling Years, an Horse erect Of Mountain-Bulk, by Pallas' Art divine, And joint the Ribs with Fir: This they pretend A Vow for their Return; That Fame they spread. Here in the hollow Sides some chosen Troops They secretly inclose; and all the Womb, And roomy Caverns with arm'd Soldiers fill. In Sight lies Tenedos, an Isle renown'd By Fame, and rich, while Priam's Kingdom stood; Now but a Bay, and faithless Port for Ships. Here, in the unregarded Shore, retir'd They hide themselves; We strait suppose them gone, And for Mycenæ fail'd before the Wind. Therefore all Troy from long Restraint is freed; Open are flung the Gates; and pleasant 'twas To walk abroad, and view the Doric Camps, The Posts abandon'd, and forsaken Shore. Here lay the Dolopes, Achilles there; Here rode the Fleet, and there the Troops engag'd. Part, at Minerva's fatal Gift amaz'd, Admire the Steed's prodigious Size; And first (Whether by Fraud, or so the Fate of Troy Requir'd) Thymætes moves to have it drawn Within the Walls, and plac'd upon the Tow'r. But Capys, and the more experienc'd Heads, Persuade to plunge into the Sea, or burn, The Grecian Treach'ry, and suspected Gifts; At least to pierce the Timber, and explore It's hollow Womb. The fickle Multitude Vote Contradictions, and in Parts divide. First, before all, surrounded with a Croud, Laocoon, chafing, from the lofty Fort Runs down, and Thus from far; What Frenzy blinds My wretched Countrymen? Think you the Foes Are gone? And Grecian Gifts can be sincere? Thus is Ulysses known? Or in This Wood Greeks are inclos'd; Or this Machine is form'd Against our Ramparts, to inspect the Town, And from above invade; Or some Design There lies conceal'd: Ye Trojans, credit not This Pile; Whate'er it be, I dread the Greeks, Ev'n when They come with Presents in their Hands. Thus having spoke, against the crooked Sides, And jointed Belly, with prodigious Strength, He whirl'd his mighty Spear: That quiv'ring stood; A grumbling Sound came from within, and all The hollow Caverns rattled at the Stroke. And had not Fate, and our misguided Minds Conspir'd; by his Advice our Steel had hewn The Grecian Lurking-Dens: Thou, Troy, hadst Now Been standing; and great Priam's Tow'rs entire. Mean-while the Trojan Shepherds, shouting, drag'd A Youth, with pinion'd Arms, before the King: Who with Design had fall'n into their Hands, Unknown; to manage the concerted Plot, And open to the Greeks the Gates of Troy; Bold to attempt, and on both sides prepar'd, Either to meet Success, or certain Death. Eager of such a Sight, the Trojan Youth Flock round; and strive to make the Wretch their Sport. Now hear the Grecian Wiles; and from the Guilt Of One, learn All. For in the Middle as he stood to View, Confounded, and disarm'd; and all around Survey'd the Trojan Troops; What Land, he cry'd, Or Seas can now receive me? And what now To wretched me remains? Who have no Place Among the Greeks; The Trojans too incens'd Demand to slake their Vengeance with my Blood. By such pathetick Groans our Minds were chang'd; All Fury ceas'd: We urge him to declare His Birth, and Country; what Intelligence He brought; what Hope in Bonds he entertain'd. Reliev'd from Fear, at length he Thus proceeds, All Things, O King, with Truth I will confess; Nor will deny my self to be a Greek; This first: For cruel Fortune, tho' she makes Sinon a Wretch, shall never make him False. If e'er the Name and Glory most renown'd Of Palamede by Fame has reach'd your Ears; Whom guiltless, and by forgery accus'd, Because he spoke against the War, the Greeks Condemn'd to Death, and now lament him dead: Me, a close Friend to Him, and near in Blood, My wealthless Father hither sent in Arms, From my first Youth. While He in safety stood, And prudent Counsels flourish'd in the State; I too some share of Name and Credit bore. But when by false Ulysses' envious Spight (Things not unknown I speak) he left the World; Afflicted, I consum'd my Days in Grief, And sullen Privacy; and inly mourn'd With Indignation for my guiltless Friend. Nor could refrain (Fool that I was) from Talk; And if a fit Occasion e'er was found, If e'er with Conquest I return'd to Greece, I vow'd Revenge; and with provoking Words Exasp'rated his Malice. Hence my first Of Ills: Ulysses scares me with new Crimes, Scatters ambiguous Rumours thro' the Croud, And conscious seeks fit Engines for my Fall. Nor rested; 'till by Calchas' Ministry— But why do I This nauseous Tale in vain Revolve? Or why delay? Since all the Greeks You equally regard; Enough is said: Now take my Life; 'Tis what Ulysses wants, And both th'Atridæ would rejoice to hear. Eager we burn t'enquire, and know the Cause, Unskill'd in Villany, and Grecian Arts: He trembling, and with guileful Heart proceeds. Oft have the Greeks desir'd t'abandon Troy, To raise their Siege, and quit the tedious War, Fatigu'd: And would They had: But oft the Sea Tempestuous kept them back; and Southern Winds Deter'd them. Chiefly, when this Timber-Steed Was built; loud Storms roll'd rattling thro' the Sky. In deep Suspense Eurypylus we send, Instructed to consult the Delian God: He from the Shrines This dreadful Answer brings. With Blood, Ye Greeks, and with a Virgin slain You sooth'd the Winds, when first you came to Troy; With Blood you must procure a safe Return, And by the Off'ring of a Grecian Life. Soon as This Message reach'd the vulgar Ears, Amazement seis'd on all; and chilling Dread Ran thro' their Veins; whom Phœbus should demand, Who should be doom'd to Death. Ulysses here With Noise and Tumult to th'Assembly brings The Prophet Calchas, urges him to tell The Meaning of the Gods: And Many now Fatal to me presag'd the Villain's Plot, And silent saw th'Event. Ten days reserv'd, And mute he stands; refusing with his Voice To sentence any, or expose to Death. 'Till by Ulysses' Clamours scarce o'erpow'r'd, At last by Compact he the silence breaks, And Me declares the Victim: All assent; And what Each fear'd would light upon himself, All on the Ruin of one Wretch devolve. And now the fatal Day was come; for me The holy Ceremonies are prepar'd, The season'd Cakes, and Fillets round my Head: Death, I confess, I 'scap'd, and broke my Bonds; And in a muddy Lake among the Reeds Obscurely lurk'd by Night; 'till they should hoise Their Sails, if haply such were their Design. And now to me, forlorn, no Hope is left Of e'er beholding my sweet Native Soil, Or my dear Children, or my long'd-for Sire; Whose forfeit Lives, perhaps, for my Escape, They will demand; and expiate This Offence By Their untimely Death. For which, by Heav'n, By all the Gods, who witness to the Truth, By all That Faith (if any such there be) Which yet remains untainted in the World, You suppliant I implore; commiserate Such mighty Woes, commiserate a Wretch Not meriting th'Afflictions he endures. Mov'd by These Tears, we grant him Life; and first Priam himself commands him to be freed From his close Manacles, and cramping Chains. Then Thus in friendly Words; Whoe'er Thou art, Forget th'abandon'd Greeks; Thou shalt be Ours; And answer true to what I now demand. Why built they This prodigious Steed? What Aim? Who is th'Inventer? What religious Vow Is This they make? Or what Machine of War? He said; The other furnish'd well with Fraud, And Grecian Arts, upraises to the Stars His Hands unmanacled; and Thus replies. You, Ye eternal Fires, I here attest, And your inviolable Deity; Ye Swords, and Altars, which I 'scap'd; Ye Wreaths, Which I, as Victim, wore: I now am free To cancel all Engagements to the Greeks, To hate them, and disclose whate'er they hide, Oblig'd no longer by my Country's Laws. Thou only keep thy Promise, and preserve, O Troy, thy plighted Faith, Thy self preserv'd; As I speak Truth, and make thee large Amends. The only Hopes of Greece, since first the War Commenc'd, depended on Minerva's Aid. But since the Time, when Tydeus' impious Son, And Ithacus, Artificer of Frauds, Killing the Guards that watch'd the lofty Tow'r, Dar'd from your hallow'd Temple to purloin Minerva's fatal Image, and presum'd With bloody Hands to touch her virgin Wreaths; Our ebbing Hopes ran back, our Strength decay'd; The Goddess in her Mind averse: Of which Signs by undoubted Prodigies she gave. Scarce was her Statue lodg'd within the Camp; Her glaring Eye-balls flash'd with darted Flames, Salt Sweat bedew'd her Limbs; and (strange to tell!) Thrice, leaping from the Ground, she clash'd her Shield, And shook her Lance. Immediately the Seer Declares the Sea must be explor'd by Flight, And Troy would never fall by Grecian Pow'rs; Unless they bore fresh Auguries from Greece, And brought the Goddess back, who o'er the Main Was thither in their winding Ships convey'd. Now that they sail for Greece, they furnish Arms, And reconcile the Gods; Then, o'er the Sea Returning, unexpected they will here Arrive: So Calchas has dispos'd the Scheme. In lieu of the Palladium, to appease Th'offended Goddess, and That Crime attone; This Figure, warn'd by Oracles, they rear'd. Yet Calchas gave Command to build it huge With jointed Oak, and raise it to the Sky; Lest it should find admittance thro' the Gates, And, drawn within the Walls of Troy, protect The People by their old religious Rites. For should you violate Minerva's Gift; Then wide Destruction (rather may the Gods Turn the dire Omen on Himself) would fall On Priam's Empire, and the State of Troy. But should it by your Hands be drawn within Your City; Asia, of it self, would come With pow'rful War to Pelopeian Walls, And our Posterity Those Fates attend. To such false Tales, and perjur'd Sinon's Art We yield full Credit; by commanded Tears, And Frauds, ensnar'd: Whom neither Diomede, Nor fam'd Larissa's Hero could subdue, Nor ten Years Conflict, nor a thousand Ships. Here a Portent more dismal strikes our Sight, And terrifies our unprovided Breasts. Laocoon, Neptune's Priest by Lot assign'd, With all the Pomp of solemn Sacrifice A stately Bull before his Altars slew. When lo! from Tenedos thro' the calm Deep (With Horrour I relate) two dreadful Snakes, With Orbs immense, incumbent on the Main Together make to Shore: Whose Breasts erect Among the Floods, and bloody-colour'd Crests Stand high above the Waves: Their other Part, Prone on the Billows, sweeps behind; and twists Their spacious Backs in Spires: The frothy Sea Roars, as they swim. And now they gain'd the Land, (Their glaring Eyes distain'd with Blood, and Fire) And lick'd their hissing Mouths with quiv'ring Tongues. Pale at the sight we fly: Their sinuous Trains They to Laocoon roll direct; and first With dire Embrace about the little Limbs Of his two Sons both Serpents curling round, With cruel Fangs their tender Flesh devour. Himself, with Arms advancing to their Help, They next invade; and with prodigious Folds Inclose him; now twice wreath'd about his Waist; Their scaly Backs twice round his Neck convolv'd: Their Heads and lofty Crests stand high in Air. He labours with his Hands to tear the Knots, (His Fillets with black Gore, and Poison smear'd) And bellows hideously to Heav'n; as when A Bull just wounded from the Altar flies, And with his Neck eludes th'uncertain Axe. But both the Serpents, sliding off, repair To the high Fane, and stern Tritonia's Tow'r; There lurk secure, beneath the Goddess' Feet, And the round Concave of her bossy Shield. A new Surprize, and Fear, 'till now unknown, Runs thro' the trembling Breasts of All: And now They say Laocoon's Crime had well deserv'd His Fate; who durst profane the sacred Wood, And hurl against it's Side his impious Spear. All cry to draw the Steed within the Town, And reconcile the Goddess. We break the Ramparts, and a Gap disclose; All to the Work addressing: Twisted Cords About his Neck, and Wheels beneath his Feet They fix: The dire Machine ascends our Walls, Teeming with Arms; Boys, and unmarry'd Girls Sing holy Metre round him, and rejoice To touch the Cords: He still with threat'ning Nod Slides on, and gains the Middle of the Town. O Ilion! O my Country! Seat of Gods! And You, Dardanian Walls, renown'd in War! Four times ev'n in the Entrance fix'd he stood; And four times Armour clatter'd in his Womb. Yet thoughtless We push on; and blindly place The fatal Monster on the sacred Tow'r. Then too, obsequious to the God's Command, Cassandra open'd her prophetick Mouth, In vain, and fated ne'er to be believ'd. We miserable, doom'd to see That Day Our last, the sacred Turrets of the Gods With festal Boughs, o'er all the City, crown. Mean-while the Hemisphere rolls round, and Night Swift rushes from the Sea; in dusky Shade Involving Earth, and Heav'n, and Grecian Frauds. The Trojans, scatter'd o'er the Walls, lie hush'd In Silence; Sleep relieves their weary Limbs. And now from Tenedos the Grecian Fleet To the known Shores, with well-appointed Ships, Sails, by the friendly Silence of the Moon; The Royal Deck distinguish'd by it's Lights. And now, protected by the partial Fates, Sinon by stealth unlocks the Greeks inclos'd In Timber-Caverns: Them to open Air The Horse restores; and from his hollow Wood The joyful Chiefs slide by a Rope let down; Tisandrus, Sthenelus, and dire Ulysses, Athamas, Thoas, Neoptolemus Son of Achilles, and Machaon first, And Menelaüs, and the Architect Epëus, who the treach'rous Engine form'd. They seize the Town, immers'd in Sleep, and Wine; Kill all the Sentries; at the open'd Gates Receive their conscious Troops, and join their Friends. 'Twas now the Season, when the first Repose, Sweet Gift of Gods, on weary Mortals creeps: Lo! in a Dream, before my slumb'ring Eyes The much afflicted Hector seem'd to stand, Profuse of Tears; drag'd with the Chariot's Wheels, As heretofore; besmear'd with bloody Dust; And thro' his swelling Feet transfix'd with Thongs. Ah me! How was he from That Hector chang'd, Who once return'd Triumphant in the Spoils Of great Achilles; or who flung his Fire Amidst the Grecian Vessels! Foul his Beard; His Hair all clung, and clotted with his Blood: And in his Body all the Wounds receiv'd Before his Native Walls. I first began, And weeping in These mournful Accents spoke. O Thou, the Light, and certain Hope of Troy; How, Hector, hast thou been detain'd? From whence Com'st thou so long expected? How fatigu'd, After such various Labours of the State, And so much Slaughter of thy Countrymen, Do we behold thee? What unworthy Hand Has soil'd thy Face serene? Or why Those Wounds? He no Reply to my vain Questions gave: But with a dismal Groan, Ah! fly, he cry'd, Fly, Goddess-born, and save thee from These Flames. The Enemy has gain'd our Walls; and Troy Is tumbling from it's Height. Enough is done For Priam, and our Country: If any Hand Could have sav'd Troy, by This she had been sav'd. Her Gods, and her Religion she commends To Thee; take These as Partners of thy Fates: For These a City seek, which thou at last, The Ocean having wander'd o'er, shalt build. He said; And brought the Garlands from their Shrines, Great Vesta's Image, and th'eternal Fire. Mean-while, with Cries confus'd the Walls resound: And tho' my Father's Palace fenc'd with Trees, Stood from the Hurry of the Town retir'd; The Noise grows loud, and th'undistinguish'd Din Of clashing Arms rolls nearer. Rous'd from Sleep, I gain the Summit of the high-built House; And stand with list'ning Ears. As when a Flame Invades a Field of Corn by driving Winds; Or, rushing from the Hills, a rapid Flood Lays flat the Product of the Plains, lays flat The rising Crop, and Labours of the Plough, And with a sweeping Torrent whirls the Woods; On a high Rock the doubtful Peasant stands Amaz'd, and in his Ear receives the Sound. Now all the Truth appear'd, and Grecian Faith Lay plain to View: Now vanquish'd by the Fire Deiophobus' wide stately Palace falls With noisy Ruin: Next Ucalegon Blazes aloft; The broad Sigéan Sea Glares with the Conflagration: Loudly sound The Trumpets Clangor, and the Cries of Men. Arms with mad Haste I snatch; tho' little Hope There was from Arms: Yet eager glow'd my Mind To form a Body for the Fight, and rush Into the Cittadel among my Friends: Anger and Rage precipitate my Soul, And glorious 'twas, I thought, to die in Arms. Lo! Pantheus, from the Grecian Darts escap'd, Pantheus Otriades, Apollo's Priest, Bears in his Hands the holy Utensils, His little Grandson, and his vanquish'd Gods, And runs, with pace distracted, to the Shore. What Posture, Pantheus, has the main Affair? What Castle do we seize? I scarce had spoke; When groaning he reply'd. Our last of Days, And Troy's inevitable Hour is come; We Trojans have been, Ilium once has been, And the long Glory of the Dardan Race: To Argos cruel Jove has all transferr'd, And Greece now domineers in flaming Troy. The lofty Steed amidst the City pours Arm'd Troops; and Sinon Conqu'ror scatters Fire, Insulting: Others thro' the open'd Gates Arrive by Thousands; a more num'rous Force Than ever yet from great Mycenæ came. Others with Arms the Passes of the Streets Have seiz'd; Their Swords with glitt'ring Blades stand drawn, Thirsting for Blood: The first Guards of the Gates Scarce try the Fight, and blind Resistance make. By Pantheus' Words, and by the Gods inflam'd, I hurry swift into the Fires, and Arms; Where dire Erinnys, where the Tumult calls, And the loud Noise ascending to the Sky. Ripheus, and Iphitus renown'd in Arms, And Hypanis, and Dymas, by the Moon, Join me, and thick'ning gather to my Side. And young Chorœbus, Mygdon's Son; who came By chance in Those unhappy Days to Troy, With Love unbounded for Cassandra fir'd; And, as a Son-in-Law, Assistance brought To Priam, and the Trojans: hapless Youth, Who the Advice of his prophetick Spouse Had not regarded. Whom when I saw compacted, and resolv'd For Fight; I thus begin. Brave Youths, but brave In vain, if you are fix'd to follow me Daring the worst; the Posture of Affairs You see; The Gods, by whom This Kingdom stood, Have all withdrawn from their abandon'd Shrines, And left their Altars: You would yet assist The flaming City; let us die, and rush Into the thickest Arms: To vanquish'd Men The only Safety is to hope for None. These Words add Rage to Courage: Thence like Wolves Prouling in gloomy Shade, which Hunger blind Urges along, while their forsaken Whelps Expect them with dry Jaws; thro' Darts, thro' Foes We march to certain Death, and take our way Thro' the mid City: Night with dusky Shade Involves us. Who the Horrour of That Night, The Ruins and Confusion can express? Or equal such prodigious Woes with Tears? Down falls the ancient City, which so long Had proudly reign'd: Thro' Houses, thro' the Streets, And Temples, sluggish Carcasses, around, Lie, roll'd in Heaps: Nor do the Trojans bleed Alone; The Vanquish'd in their Turn resume Their Courage; and the conqu'ring Grecians fall. A Scene of Slaughter ev'ry where appears, And Terrour, and a thousand Shapes of Death. First of the Greeks, surrounded with a Croud, Androgeos meets us, thinking us his own Associate Troops; and Thus familiar speaks. Haste, Soldiers; What Delay retards your Arms? Others divide, and ravage burning Troy: Come you This Moment from your lofty Ships? He said; And strait (for Answer was not giv'n So friendly as he thought) he found himself Amidst his Foes: Surpriz'd with Fear he back Recoil'd, and with his Speech repress'd his Steps. Like One, who unawares in prickly Thorns Has trod upon a Snake; and starting fled Him rousing all his Venom, and with Rage Heaving his speckled Neck. Androgeos so Shudd'ring withdrew. We forwards rushing press, And them, around inclos'd with clatt'ring Arms, Unknowing of the place, and struck with Fear We vanquish: Fortune crowns our first Attempt. Flush'd with new Fire, and proud of his Success, Chorœbus Thus advis'd. O Friends, the Way To Conquest, which our first kind Fortune shews, Let us pursue; and follow where she leads. Our Habit let us change; and wear disguis'd The Grecian Shields and Helmets: Who would ask Whether 'twere Art, or Valour in a Foe? Themselves shall give us Arms. Thus having said, Himself puts on the bossy burnish'd Shield, And crested Helmet which Androgeos wore, And buckles to his Side the Grecian Sword. The same does Ripheus, Dymas next, then all The Youth, exulting: With the recent Spoils Each arms himself: Among the Greeks we march, Mingled, with Gods not Ours: In gloomy Shades, Obscure, by various Skirmishes we fight; And many of the Greeks we send to Hell. Some to their Ships retire, and flying seek The faithful Shores: While, seiz'd with Coward Fear, Others again ascend the monstrous Horse, And in the well-known Belly lurk conceal'd. All human Confidence, alas! is vain, When Heav'n opposes. From Minerva's Shrines, And Temple, lo! the Priameian Maid, Cassandra, with dishevel'd Hair is drag'd, Throwing in vain her glaring Eyes to Heav'n; Her Eyes; for Bonds confin'd her tender Hands. Enrag'd by Love to Madness, such a Sight Chorœbus could not bear; but desp'rate flings Himself into the Middle of the Foes: We follow all, into the thickest Arms Rushing. Here first from the high Temple's Top Our Friends with Darts o'erwhelm us; Thence ensues A dreadful Slaughter, by our Armour's Form, And by the Error of our Grecian Plumes. Then at the Rescue of the Royal Maid The Greeks enrag'd, invade us; Ajax fierce, Both the Atridæ, all the Dolopes, Gath'ring from ev'ry Part. As when the Winds Adverse in Hurricane abrupt engage, Notus, and Zephyrus, and Eurus swift Exulting with his Eastern Steeds: The Woods Roar loud; And Nereus with his Trident storms Foamy, and from the Bottom stirs the Deep. Those too, whom we by Stratagem dispers'd In Night obscure, and drove thro' all the Town, Appear; They first discern our borrow'd Arms, And in our Speech the disagreeing Sounds. Strait Multitudes o'erpow'r us: And before Minerva's Altar, first Chorœbus falls, Kill'd by Peneleus; Ripheus next, than whom No Trojan was more just and good; tho' Heav'n Decreed not so: Dymas, and Hypanis, Stab'd by their Friends: Nor could thy Piety, O Pantheus, nor the consecrated Wreaths Of Phœbus, save thee from as hard a Fate. You, Ye dear Ruins, and last Flames of Troy, I call to witness; that I ne'er declin'd The Greeks, nor shrink'd from Dangers in your Fall: And had I been by Destiny decreed To die; my Actions merited my Death. Thence Iphitus, and Pelias, with Myself, Were hurry'd: Iphitus infirm with Age, And Pelias by a Wound Ulysses gave. Hence the loud Noise to Priam's Royal Seat Calls us away: Here fierce the Battle burns; So fierce, as if in other Parts no War Were heard, no other Slaughter thro' the Town. A Fight so obstinate we see; and Crouds Of Greeks, beneath a Canopy of Shields, Thick rushing to the Palace; and the Gates By Siege assaulted. Scaling-Ladders hang Against the Walls: And by the Steps they strive To gain the Doors; With their left Hands oppose Their Shields to Storms of Arrows, with their right Grasp at the Battlements. To Them adverse The Trojans tumble Roofs, and Turrets down; Seeing the worst, and in the last Extremes Of Death, such Arms they use for their Defence; Rolling down gilded Beams, the stately Pomp Of Royal Ancestors: With Swords unsheath'd Others stand thick below, and guard the Doors. Fresh with recruited Rage, we fly to save The Court, and re-inforce our fainting Friends. There was an unregarded Postern Door, 'Twixt Priam's Palaces contiguous plac'd, An Entry of a private Use; through which Hapless Andromache, while Troy remain'd, (Such was her Custom) unattended went, To see the aged Royal Pair, and bring Her young Astyanax to his Grandsire's Arms. Up to the highest Battlements I go; From whence the miserable Trojans flung Their unavailing Darts. There stood a Tow'r Tall, and conspicuous; from the lofty Roof Rais'd to the Stars: From whence all Troy we view'd, The Grecian Navy, and the Grecian Camp. This we encompass round; and with our Steel, Just where th'extremest Planks disjointed gave Easiest Access, we rend it from on high Push'd forward: Swift with Ruin, loud with Noise, It thunders down, and on the Grecian Troops With wide Destruction falls: But Others still Succeed them; Nor do Stones, or any Kind Of Weapons cease to fly. In the first Portal, storming at the Door, Pyrrhus exults; with Arms, and brazen Light Refulgent. Like a Snake, in open Air; Who all the Winter, fed with noxious Herbs, And swoln with Poison, lurk'd in Earth, and there Cast his old Skin; now glitt'ring, new with Scales, And sleek in Youth, he rolls his slipp'ry Spires; Erect against the Sun his burnish'd Breast Uprears, and darts his quiv'ring forky Tongue. With Him his Squire Automedon, who drove Achilles' Steeds, great Periphas, and all The Scyrian Youth advance; and to the Top Hurl flaming Brands: Himself, before the rest, Grasping a Battle-Axe, the stubborn Doors Bursts thro', and from their massy Hinges rends The brazen Posts; Now, having hewn the Beams, He splits their solid Timber, and a Gap Discloses wide. Th'interior Court appears; Long Gali'ries, Priam's Rooms of State, and all Th'Imperial Pomp of ancient Kings they see, And Sentries standing at the Doors in Arms. But with confus'd Laments, the inner Rooms, With Tumult, Noise, and wild Distraction, sound; The echoing Palace rings with female Shrieks, And the shrill Clamour beats the golden Stars. From place to place the trembling Matrons run, Thro' the vast Court; and cling, and hug, and kiss The Pillars: Pyrrhus with his Father's Fire Still pushes on; Nor can the Bars, or Guards Sustain his Fury: To the batt'ring Rams The Gate gives way; And from their Hinges torn The solid Posts lie flat. A spacious Breach Is made; The thronging Greeks break in; then kill The first they meet; and with arm'd Soldiers croud The rich Apartments. With less rapid Force A foamy River, when th'opposing Dams Are broken down, rolls rushing o'er the Plain, And sweeping whirls the Cattle with their Folds. These Eyes saw Pyrrhus raging, smear'd with Gore, And both th'Atridæ in the Entrance storm; Amidst an hundred Daughters saw the Queen; And Priam, on the Altars, with his Blood Pollute Those hallow'd Fires, which he himself Had consecrated. Fifty Bridal-Rooms, (So great their Hopes of num'rous future Heirs) The Posts with Trophies, and Barbarick Gold Magnificent, lay smoking on the Ground; Where the Flames fail, the Greeks supply their place. Perhaps for Priam's Fate you will enquire. He, when he saw the captive City's Fall, His Gates torn off their Hinges, and the Foe Within his Palace, Armour long disus'd, With vain Attempt, upon his Shoulders hangs, Trembling with feeble Age; and to his Side Girds an unprofitable Sword: then flings Himself, resolv'd to die, among the Foes. Just in the Centre of the Court, beneath The open Sky, a spacious Altar stood; Near it an ancient Laurel, hanging o'er The sacred Hearth, and cov'ring with it's Shade The Houshold-Gods. Here Hecuba, and all Her Daughters, like a Flock of trembling Doves Driv'n by a Tempest, vainly round the Shrines, Clinging, embrac'd the Statues of the Gods. But when in youthful Arms she saw the King; What desp'rate Rage, she cry'd, what Frenzy moves My wretched Husband to be harness'd Thus? Or whither wouldst thou? Not such Aid as Thine, Nor such Defenders does the Time require; Not, tho' my Hector's self were here in Arms. But come; This Altar shall protect us All: At least we will be join'd in Death. This said, She to her self receiv'd the aged King, And plac'd him trembling in the sacred Seat. When lo! Polites, one of Priam's Sons, By slaught'ring Pyrrhus press'd, thro' Darts, thro' Foes, Gazing about, runs round the spacious Court, And wounded thro' the winding Cloysters flies. Him, ardent, threat'ning with a mortal Dart, Pyrrhus pursues; just ready with his Hand To seize him, and discharge the deadly Blow. At length, arriv'd before his Parents' Eyes, He fell; and, welt'ring in a Flood of Gore, Pour'd out his Soul. Here Priam, tho' beset With Death on ev'ry side, could not refrain; But Thus indulg'd his Rage. For Crimes like These, So bold, and monstrous, may the righteous Gods (If Heav'n has any Justice, that regards Such Outrages) reward thee, as thy Deeds Deserve; who thus hast forc'd me to behold The Murder of my Son, and with his Blood, Barbarian! couldst pollute a Father's Sight. Not so Achilles, whom with lying Vaunt Thou call'st Thy Father; he not so behav'd To Priam his Foe: But rev'rencing the Rights, And Faith of Suppliants, Hector's Corps restor'd To Burial; and dismiss'd me to my Realms. So spake the aged Sire; And feebly flung, Without a Wound, an unperforming Dart: Which, by the Target's sounding Brass repuls'd, Hung on the Surface of it's bossy Orb. To whom Thus Pyrrhus. Thou shalt then relate Such Crimes; and bear This Message to my Sire Achilles; Him remember to inform Of my foul Deeds, and his degen'rate Boy: Now die. Then drags him to the sacred Hearth, Trembling, and sliding, on the slipp'ry Ground, In his Son's Blood; and, twisting in his Hair His Left hand, with the Right his glitt'ring Sword Deep to the Hilt he plunges in his Side. Such was the End of Priam's Fates; the last Concluding Scene, which Destiny decreed To Asia's Lord; once o'er so many Realms, And Nations, Sov'reign Monarch; having seen His Troy in Flames, and tumbling to the Ground: Upon the Shore the Royal Body lies Expos'd; the Head from off the Shoulders torn; A Trunk dishonour'd, and without a Name. Here Horrour first surrounded me. Amaz'd I stood; My Father's Image to my Mind It self presented; when I saw the King, In Age his Equal, by a barb'rous Wound Expiring: To my Thoughts at once recurr'd My dear Creüsa left at home, my House Expos'd to Plunder, and th'impending Fate Of young Iülus. Round I look'd, to see What Force was near: All harrass'd out were gone; Some leaping to the Ground; Some, spent and sick With Toil, had flung themselves into the Flames. Now I alone remain'd; When in the Porch Of Vesta's Temple, Helen I behold Silent, and lurking in the sacred Seat. The glaring Conflagration, as I rove, And throw my Eyes around, affords me Light. There She, the common Pest of Greece, and Troy, Fearing the Trojans for their City's Fall Incens'd, the just Resentments of the Greeks, And her abandon'd Husband's Rage, conceal'd Her self, and skulking on the Altars sate The curst Incendiary. Within my Breast Glow'd furious Fires, inflam'd me to revenge My ruin'd Country, and due Punishment Inflict on Crimes. Shall then This Sorc'ress safe Visit Mycenæ, and her Native Soil? Shall she, a Queen, in pompous Triumph ride, Her Consort, Parents, House, and Children see, Surrounded with our Captive Trojan Dames: While Priam by the Sword expires, Troy burns, The Dardan Shore so often sweats with Blood? Not so: For tho' a Woman's Death affords No Glory, nor does Fame the Conquest crown; At least the Praise of having eas'd the World Of such a Trait'ress shall be Mine; I'll take Due Vengeance: 'Twill be some Relief, to glut My Rage, and with a Sacrifice so just The Manes of my Country to appease. Such Passions tossing in my stormy Breast, I hurry forward: When to Sight reveal'd My heav'nly Parent, never seen before So clearly, to my Eyes her self presents, Confess'd a Goddess: Thro' the dusky Shades She shone in Light serene; Such, and as great As she appears in Heav'n. My Arm she grasp'd; And, as she held me, from her rosy Mouth These Accents fell. What fierce Resentment boils Thy untam'd Rage, my Son, to such a height? Why do'st thou storm? Or whither is thy Care For Us withdrawn? Will you not rather think, Where 'twas you left your aged Father, where Your Wife Creüsa; whether yet She lives, And young Ascanius? Whom the Grecian Troops All hover round; And, did not my Concern Prevent, the fiery Tempest had e'er this Consum'd them, or the hostile Sword devour'd. 'Tis not Tyndarian Helen's hated Form, Nor much blam'd Paris; Heav'n, inclement Heav'n O'erturns This Realm, and levels Tow'ring Troy. Behold, (for I'll remove That dewy Mist, Which dulls thy Sight, and dims thy mortal Eyes; Suspect not thou my Precepts, nor refuse, Diffiding, to obey thy Mother's Words:) Here, where you see That Rubbish, Heaps confus'd, Stones wrench'd from Stones, and thick redounding Smoke Blended with Clouds of Dust; great Neptune shakes The Walls, and with his massy Trident heaves The City from it's deep Foundations. There Relentless Juno, girt with Steel, has seiz'd The Scæan Gates; and, raging, from their Ships Calls her confed'rate Forces. Next, (That way bend thy Eyes) the lofty Tow'rs Tritonian Pallas has possess'd; There sits, With her dire Gorgon, in a beamy Cloud, Effulgent. Jove himself the Grecian Troops With Courage, and new Strength supplies; Himself Excites the Gods against the Dardan Arms. Escape by Flight, my Son, and end thy Toil; I always will be present to thy Aid, And place thee safe within thy Father's Walls. She said; and in th'involving Shades retir'd: The direful Shapes appear, and Foes to Troy Forms of the awful Gods. All Ilium now I saw among the Fires Sinking lie flat; and from it's Bottom turn'd Down falls Neptunian Troy. As when an Ashe Aged, and tall, is on the Mountains hewn By Rusticks; who in emulation strive With Strokes of Axes, and repeated Steel To overturn it: Oft it nods, and shakes It's leafy Top; still tott'ring, 'till at length Subdu'd by Wounds, it groans it's last, and torn From the high Ridge with cumb'rous Ruin falls. Conducted by the Godhead I descend; Dispatch'd, by her Protection, thro' the Flames, And Foes: The Darts give way, the Flames retire. But when I came within my Father's Walls; He, whom I first propos'd, and first desir'd Up the high Mountains to convey, refus'd, After the Sack of Troy, to save his Life, And suffer Exile. You, he cry'd, whose Blood Runs vigorous in youthful Veins, do You Secure yourselves by Flight. Me did the Gods permit to live, This Seat They would have left me: 'Tis enough, and more, That I have seen one Ruin, and surviv'd The captive City. Thus, O! Thus of Me Take your Farewel; and leave This lifeless Corps. With my own Hand myself may find a Death: The Foe will pity me, and hither come For Spoils: The Ceremony of a Grave Is easily dispens'd with: Long abhorr'd By Heav'n, and useless to the World, I drag A wretched Being; since with Light'ning's Flash Jove blasted me, and sing'd me with his Fire. He said; and in his Purpose persever'd: We, on the other side, dissolv'd in Tears, My Wife Creüsa, young Ascanius, all The Family, intreat him not to urge The Ruin of Himself, and Us; nor sink Beneath the Load of Fate. He still denies, And obstinately resolute persists. Again I rush to Arms, and desp'rate wish My Death: For now what Fortune could I try? What Measures take? Could you, my Father, think I would remove from hence, and leave You here? Thus could you wrong my Filial Piety? If Heav'n decrees that nothing shall remain Of so renown'd a City; and your Will Stands fix'd to add yourself, and all your Friends To falling Troy: The Means of such a Death Are obvious. Reeking fresh with Priam's Blood, Pyrrhus will soon be here; who slew the Son Before his Father's Eyes, the Father's self Before his Altars. Was it then for This, Celestial Parent, that you brought me safe Thro' Flames, and Jav'lins; that I might behold Th'insulting Foe within our Palace-Walls, Ascanius, and my Father, and my dear Creüsa, butcher'd in each other's Blood? Arms, Arms, my Friends; Tho' vanquish'd, This last Day Calls us to Arms: Give me the Greeks again; Off; let me go: I'll see the Fight renew'd; This Day we will not All die unreveng'd. Once more I gird on Arms, refit my Shield To my left Hand, and rushing seek the Door. When lo! Creüsa in the Entrance clasp'd My Feet, there clinging close; and to his Sire Held out my young Iülus: If you go To die, take Us with you in all Extremes: Or if you yet have any Hope conceiv'd In taking Arms; defend This Mansion first; In which your Father, and your little Son Are left, and I who once was call'd your Wife. Shrieking she spoke; and with her shrill Laments Fill'd all the Palace: When a Prodigy Sudden, and wond'rous to relate, appear'd. For as before his weeping Parents Eyes He stood, between our Hands; lo! from the Head Of young Iülus, rose a glimm'ring Flame; Harmless with gentle Touch it glided o'er His Hair, and lambent round his Temples fed. Trembling with Fear, we brush the burning Locks; And Water bring, to quench the sacred Fire. But old Anchises joyful lifts his Eyes To Heav'n, and stretches out his suppliant Hands. Almighty Jove, if Thou by any Prayers Art mov'd, this once behold us; and if aught Our Piety deserves, afford us now Thy Succour, and This Prodigy confirm. He scarce had ended; With a sudden Crash It thunder'd to the Left; and thro' the Shades A falling Star from Heav'n with glaring Light Glided along, and drew a Trail of Flame. O'er the high Palace-Top we saw it run, And hide itself within th'Idæan Grove, Marking our Way; th'indented Path shines bright, In a long Track; and Sulphur smokes around. At This o'erpow'r'd, Anchises rose, the Gods Invoking; and ador'd the sacred Star. Now, now there's no Delay; where-e'er you lead, I follow: You, our Country-Gods, preserve This House, preserve my Grandson: These Portents Are yours; and Troy subsists involv'd in You. I yield, my Son; no longer I refuse T'accompany your flight. He said; and now The Fire more loudly roars; and from the Walls The blazing Torrent nearer rolls the Flames. Haste then, my Father; on my Shoulders lay Your aged Body; I the Load will bear, Nor think That Labour hard: Whatever Chance Betides us; Both shall share one common Fate, Escape together, or together fall. Iülus close by me shall go; my Wife Behind observe our Steps: You, Servants, mark My Words with Care. Without the City stands, On rising Ground, an old forsaken Fane Of Ceres; and an ancient Cypress near, By the Religion of our Ancestors Preserv'd for Ages: There from diff'rent Parts We all will meet in One. The holy Things Take you, my Father, and our Country-Gods: In me 'twere Guilt to touch them, just return'd Recent from so much Slaughter, and besmear'd With War; 'till in the living Stream I wash The Blood away. Thus having said, a Lion's tawny Hide I o'er my Neck, and ample Shoulders throw, And take my Burthen: Young Iülus links His Hand in mine, and with unequal Steps Runs by his Father's Side: My Wife behind Follows: Thro' gloomy Shades we search our Way. And me, whom just before no missile Darts, Nor adverse Files of charging Greeks could move, Now ev'ry Breath of Air, each ruffling Sound Alarms, sollicitous for Him I led, And Him I bore. Now near the Gates I came; And thought all Dangers of the Way o'erpass'd; When suddenly the Sound of trampling Feet Approach'd our Ears: And, looking thro' the Shades, My Father cry'd, Fly, fly, my Son; They come; I see their burnish'd Brass, and glaring Shields. Here some unfriendly Pow'r (I know not who) Bereft me of my Reason, and disturb'd My Mind: For as I shun'd the noted Streets, And sought By-ways, and Passages unknown; I lost my dear Creüsa: Whether snatch'd By Fate, she stay'd, or straggled from the Way, Or quite fatigu'd sate down to ease her Toil, Is doubtful; But she never was restor'd, Since that, to her unhappy Husband's Sight. Nor did I once look back, or recollect My Thoughts; 'till to the antiquated Dome Of Ceres, and the sacred Seat we came: There when we view'd our Number, she alone Of all was wanting; and deceiv'd her Friends, Her Son, and Husband. Raving with Distress, Whom did I not accuse, of Gods, and Men? Or what more cruel did I ever see In sack'd, and burning Troy? My Father, Son, And Country-Gods, committed to my Friends I leave, and hide them in a winding Vale. Back to the City I repair, and shine In Steel; resolv'd all Dangers to renew, Explore all Troy, and once more stake my Life. First to the Walls, and Gates, thro' which I came, In Darkness I return; with Care observe My former Steps, and round me throw my Eyes Horrour, and ev'n the dismal Silence, frights My gloomy Thoughts. Thence Home I go, to see If haply she had thither back repair'd: Instead of Her, the thronging Greeks had seiz'd, And fill'd the Palace: Strait devouring Flames To the high Roof are hurl'd; a Storm of Fire Rages aloft, and thunders in the Sky. Next I revisit Priam's Royal Seat; There, in the empty Iles of Juno's Fane, Phœnix, and dire Ulysses, chosen Guards, Watch o'er the Prey. There Trojan Treasure snatch'd From burning Shrines, the Tables of the Gods, Goblets of massy Gold, and captive Robes Lie pil'd in Heaps; Children, and trembling Dames, Rank'd in long Rows, stand round. Advent'rous thro' the Shades to send my Voice, I call aloud, and vainly fill the Streets With Repetition of Creüsa's Name. Thus as I search'd impatient o'er the Town, With endless Labour; to my Eyes appear'd Her pensive Ghost, my dear Creüsa's Shade, A Form enlarg'd, and bigger than the Life. Aghast I stood; uprose my Hair erect; And to my Mouth my Speech with Horrour cleav'd. At length she spoke, and Thus reliev'd my Cares. Why, my dear Lord, do you so far indulge Your restless Toil? Without the Pow'rs Divine These Things are not dispos'd; nor is it giv'n To you to carry your Creüsa's hence Companion of your Voyage; 'Tis deny'd By Him, the Sov'reign Monarch of the Skies. You a long Exile shall explore, and plough A wide Extent of Ocean; 'till at last At rich Hesperia's Shore you shall arrive, Where Lydian Tyber's gentle Train divides The fertil Glebe: There wish'd Success, for you, A Kingdom, and a Royal Consort wait. Lament no more your lov'd Creüsa's Loss: I never shall behold the proud Abodes Of Myrmidons, or Dolopes; nor go A Captive Servant to the Grecian Dames; A Trojan Princess born, and, as your Wife, Daughter to Venus, But the Majestick Mother of the Gods Detains me in these Coasts: Farewel; and love Your Son, our common Care. Thus having spoke, Me weeping, and a thousand Things to say Desiring, she forsook, and vanish'd swift Into the yielding Air. I thrice assay'd About her Neck to throw my folding Arms: Thrice, vainly grasp'd at, from their Circle flew Th'unbody'd Fantom, light as fleeting Winds, And like a slipp'ry Dream. The Night now spent, To my Associates I at last return, And find a Conflux of new Followers there, Admiring at their Number; Matrons, Men, With Youth assembled, and prepar'd for Flight, (A wretched Vulgar!) From all Parts they came Furnish'd with Arms, and Courage, and prepar'd To share my Fortune; to whatever Coasts My Conduct should transport them o'er the Seas. Now Lucifer on Ida's Top arose, And usher'd in the Day; the conqu'ring Greeks Possess'd the Passes of the Gates; And now No Hope of Aid was left us: I retire, Bearing my Father, and ascend the Hill. The End of the Second Book. BOOK the Third. When Asia's State, by Heav'n's severe Decree, And Priam's guiltless Realm was laid in Dust; Proud Ilion fall'n, and all Neptunian Troy Smoking in Ruins: Warn'd by Oracles To seek long Exile, and deserted Coasts, Beneath Antandros' Walls, and Ida's Rocks We build our Fleet, and muster all our Force; Uncertain which way Fate would call, and where Fix'd Mansions would be given us. Scarce begun Was the first Summer; When Anchises gave Command to hoise our Sails, and yield to Fate. Weeping I leave my Country-Shores, the Ports, And Fields where Troy had stood; and exil'd launch Into the Deep; with all our Crew, my Son, Our Country-Deities, and mightier Gods. Sacred to Mars there lies a spacious Realm, Till'd by the Thracians, and in former Times Govern'd by stern Lycurgus; once to Troy (While Fortune was) an hospitable Coast, And Their protecting Gods ally'd to Ours. Here I arrive; and on the winding Shore Found my first Walls, by inauspicious Fates Attempting; and the new Inhabitants From my own Name Æneadæ I call. To my Celestial Parent, and the Gods, Conducters of my Enterprize, I paid Religious Rites, and offer'd on the Shore A shining Bull to Heav'n's Almighty King. Near me, by chance, there stood a rising Ground, And on it's Top a Grove of Cornel-Shrubs, And Myrtle, horrid with thick pointed Spears. Thither I went; and striving from the Mold To pluck the branching Greens, with Boughs to shade The new-built Altars, a portentous Sight Dreadful and wond'rous to relate I saw. For from That Plant, which first uprooted came, Torn from the Soil, black Drops of Blood distill'd, And stain'd the Ground with Gore; Me Horror chills Shudd'ring, and Fear congeals my curdling Blood. Again another Shrub I strive to rend From Earth, t'explore the secret Cause: Again Blood follows from the Bark. Much in my Thoughts Revolving, I implore the Rural Nymphs, And Mars, who o'er the Getic Fields presides, The Omen to avert, and grant Success. But when a third time more intent I strove, Tugging, with Knees close press'd against the Sand; (Shall I proceed, or stop?) a dismal Groan, Resounding from the bottom of the Tomb, Was heard; and to my Ears with Horrour came These Accents. Why, Æneas, dost thou tear My wretched Corps? Ah! spare me; nor pollute Thy pious Hands with Guilt: Troy gave me Birth, No Foreigner to Thee; Nor does This Blood Flow from the Roots, and senseless Fibres: Fly, Ah! fly These cruel Coasts, This greedy Shore. For I am Polydore; an Iron Crop Of Darts o'erwhelms me here transfix'd, and springs In vegetable Jav'lins. Stun'd with Fear I stood; up rose my Hair; and to my Mouth My Speech with Terror cleav'd. This Polydore The most unhappy Priam had long since, In secret, with a pond'rous Mass of Gold, Sent, to be nourish'd by the Thracian King; When now, diffiding in his Arms, he saw His City by the Foe beleaguer'd round. The Thracian King, when all the Trojan Pow'rs Were crush'd, and Heav'n had our distress'd Affairs Abandon'd, closing with the Victor's Arms, And Agamemnon's happier Fortune, breaks All Faith, kills Polydore, and to his Wealth Succeeds by Murder: To what dire Extremes Wilt not Thou, execrable Thirst of Gold, Urge mortal Breasts? Recover'd of my Fright, First to my Father, then to all our chief Selected Lords, the Prodigy I tell; And ask their Resolution: All agree Unanimous, to leave the barb'rous Coasts, Polluted with inhospitable Crimes, And spread our swelling Canvass to the Winds. Therefore to Polydore we first perform His Obsequies: A lofty Pile of Earth Is rais'd; And Altars to the Manes built, Mournful with fun'ral Wreaths, and gloomy Boughs Of Cypress; With their Tresses scatter'd loose (Such is th'accustom'd Rite) the Trojan Dames Stand round; We offer Jars of tepid Milk, And frothing Bowls of consecrated Blood; Within the Grave compose his Soul to Rest, Invoke him loud, and take our last Farewel. Then soon as we might trust the Ocean's Face With safety, and the Winds had smooth'd it's Waves, Auster's soft Gales inviting to the Deep; Our Crew their Vessels launch, and fill the Shore; We leave the Port; and Land, and Towns retire. A sacred Island in mid Sea there lies, And now inhabited; above the rest Lov'd by Ægæan Neptune, and the Goddess The Mother of the Nereids; which of old Unfix'd and wand'ring round the Coasts and Shores, Pious Apollo with high Mycone, And Gya'ros bound, gave it to be unmov'd With firm Foundations, and defy the Winds. Here I arrive; This hospitable Coast In it's safe Harbour, to relieve our Toils, Receives us. At our Landing, we adore Apollo's City: Anius meets us here, At once the King of Men, and Priest of Heav'n, Apollo's Priest; with consecrated Wreaths, And holy Laurel crown'd. He knows, and owns His ancient Friend Anchises: Hands we join In Amity, and to his Court proceed. In the God's Temple built with aged Stone I worship: Settled Mansions to us give, Thymbræan God; Give us, fatigu'd with Toil, Sure Walls, a Race, a lasting City: Save This other Troy, These Relicks of the Greeks, And merciless Achilles. Heav'nly Pow'r, Whom do we follow? Whither shape our Course? Where fix our Seat, by thy Command? Indulge Some Augury, and slide into our Breasts. I scarce had spoke; All seem'd to tremble round, The Doors, the Laurel of the God, and all The Mount: The Tripos groan'd, and open flew The most retir'd Apartments. Prone we bend To Earth; and to our Ears These Accents came. Ye hardy Trojans, The same Land, which first Gave Birth to your Forefathers, shall again Receive you in it's fertil Bosom; Seek Your ancient Mother: Here th'Æneïan Line, All Years to come, shall rule with Sov'reign Sway, And his Sons Sons, and all their future Race. Thus Phœbus: Strait a mix'd, tumultuous Joy Arises: All enquire what Walls were meant, Which way the God directed us to steer Our wand'ring Course, and whither to return. My Father then revolving in his Mind Ancient Records, Thus speaks: Ye Nobles, hear, And learn your Hopes. The Isle of mighty Jove, Crete, in the Middle of the Ocean lies: There is th'Idæan Mountain, and the first Originals of our Race. The Natives there Possess'd an hundred Cities, wealthy Realms: Hence our great Sire (if I remember right,) Teucrus first landed on the Phrygian Coasts; And for his Kingdom chose a Place: As yet Ilium was not, nor stood the Trojan Tow'rs; Th'Inhabitants in lowly Vallies liv'd. Hence Cybele, the Mother of the Gods, Protectress: Hence the Corybantian Brass, And Ida's Grove; Hence Silence was observ'd In sacred Rites; And Lions harness'd drew Her Sov'reign Chariot. Let us then obey The Gods' Commands, and follow where they lead; Appease the Winds, and seek the Gnossian Coasts. Nor is the Distance great; let Jove assist, The third Day lands us on the Cretian Shores. He said; and paid the Gods their Honours due; A Bull to Neptune; and a Bull to Thee, Beauteous Apollo; to the stormy Pow'r A sable Ewe; a white one to the smooth Propitious Zephyrs. Fame reporting flies, That, exil'd from his Realms, the Grecian Chief Idomeneus had left the Coasts of Crete; And now the Towns, abandon'd by our Foes, Stood empty. We forsake Ortygia's Ports, And fly upon the Sea: Then sail along By Naxos, fam'd for Bacchanalian Hills, Olearos, Donysa ever green, And snowy Paros, and the Cyclades Dispers'd among the Waves, and Seas thick sown With various little Isles. A Noise confus'd Of Sailors rises; All exhort to stand For Crete, and seek th'Original of Troy. A Gale, behind our Stern fresh springing, speeds Our Voyage: On the ancient Coasts of Crete At length we safe arrive. With eager haste I lay Foundations of the long'd-for Town, Call it Pergamea, and exhort our Friends, Pleas'd with their Colony's new Name, to love Their Homes, and rear a Fortress for Defence. Scarce did our Vessels, drawn within the Port, Rest on dry Land; The Youth to Nuptial Rites Themselves apply'd, and till'd the new-found Soil; Laws I assign'd them, and their fix'd Abodes. When suddenly a dire malignant Plague From Air infected, and the mortal Year Seises their Blood, and blasts the Trees, and Corn. They render their sweet Souls, or faintly drag Their Bodies; Sirius burns the barren Fields; The Pastures wither; And the sickly Grain Denies us Food. My Father gives Advice Again to pass the Ocean, and return To Phœbus, and Ortygia's sacred Dome, T'implore the Favour of the God, to ask What End our Toils should find; by his Command Whence we should seek Relief, or whither steer. 'Twas Night; and Sleep possess'd the weary World. Th'Effigies of our Trojan Country-Gods, Whom from amidst the Fires of ruin'd Troy I rescu'd, in my Sleep appear'd to stand Before my Eyes; discover'd by the Light, Where the full Moon profusely pour'd her Beams Thro' the inserted Windows: Then they spoke, And with such Words as These reliev'd my Cares. What Phœbus at Ortygia would unfold, Thither should you repair, he here reveals Unask'd; and Us to your Apartment sends. We, who accompany from ruin'd Troy You, and your Arms, and pass the swelling Deep Under your Conduct, we to Heav'n will raise Your future Progeny, and Empire give: For mighty Nations seek you mighty Walls, Nor e'er decline your Travel's tedious Toil. Your Mansion must be chang'd: The Delian God Assign'd you not These Coasts, the Shores of Crete. There is a Place, by Greeks Hesperia call'd, An ancient Land, renown'd in Arms, and rich In fertil Glebe: The Oenotrians once possess'd, And till'd the Soil; The Moderns now, 'tis said, Have from their Chief the Land Italia nam'd. This is your destin'd Seat; Hence Dardanus, Iäsius hence; And from That Prince our Race Descended: Rise, and to your aged Sire With Joy relate These certain Tidings; Seek The Realms of Coritus, Ausonian Realms; Great Jove denies you the Dictæan Fields. Admonish'd thus by Vision of the Gods, (Nor was it common Sleep; for plain I saw Their Looks, their Forms, and Fillets of their Hair; Then all my Limbs a clammy Sweat bedew'd:) Eager I spring from Bed, and lift to Heav'n My Hands with Pray'r, and on the holy Hearths Offer pure Gifts. The Sacrifice perform'd; Anchises joyful I acquaint, and all In order tell. He, recollecting, owns The double Parents, and ambiguous Race, And his new Errour in the ancient Realms. Then Thus: My Son, long exercis'd by Fate, The Fate of Troy; To me These strange Events None, but Cassandra, ever did foretel. Now (I remember well) she oft pronounc'd Those Kingdoms due to us; and often nam'd Hesperia, and the Coasts of Italy. But who would Then have thought the Trojan Race Should ever at Hesperia's Shores arrive? Or whom could Then by her prophetick Voice Cassandra move? To Phœbus let us yield; And better Measures, thus advis'd, pursue. He said; we all with joyful Haste obey: We leave a few behind; This Seat forsake; Unfurl; and with our Vessels plough the Deep. Now on the full extended Main, the Land No more appear'd; but All was Sea, and Sky: A dusky Cloud hung gather'd o'er my Head, Bringing on Night, and Storm; Upon the Waves Lay horrid Darkness: Boist'rous Winds confound The rolling Sea, and mighty Billows rise. We, scatter'd o'er the boundless Deep, are toss'd; Tempests involve the Day; A Night of Rain Obscures the Heav'ns: Repeated Light'nings flash From bursting Clouds. We devious from our Course Are driv'n; and wander o'er the darken'd Waves. In the mid Sea, ev'n Palinure declares Himself unable to distinguish Day From Night, or know what Course we should pursue. Three Days entire, uncertain of the Sun, Darkling we rove; as many starless Nights: On the fourth Morn scarce rising Land appears, And distant Mountains op'ning roll the Smoke. The Sails hang slack; our Crew with lab'ring Oars Dash the curl'd Foam, and sweep the briny Waves. The Islands Strophades receive me first Sav'd from the Tempest: Strophades the Greeks Have nam'd them; Islands in th'Ionian Sea, Which dire Celæno, and her Sister Plagues The other Harpies haunt; excluded Now From Phineus' Court, and forc'd by Fear to leave Their former Banquets. Monsters more abhorr'd, And Pests more execrable, by the Wrath Of Gods, ne'er issu'd from the Stygian Lake. Bodies of Birds with female Faces join'd; A filthy Flux of Entrails; Hands with Claws Hooky; and Visages for ever pale With Hunger. When, hither driv'n, we anchor'd in the Port; Herds of fat Kine we saw, and browzing Goats, Without a Keeper, straying o'er the Fields. We rush among them with our Steel, invite The Gods, and Jove himself to share the Prey; Then spread our Tables on the winding Shore, And there repos'd on plenteous Banquets feast. When on a sudden from the Mountains Tops, With horrible Descent, the Harpies come, And shake their clatt'ring Wings; They snatch the Meat Rav'nous, and all with tainting Touch defile: An odious Scream, and noisom Stench, at once Offend us. In a long Recess, beneath An hollow Rock, fenc'd all around with Trees, And gloomy Shade, a second time we spread Our Tables, and on Altars lay the Fire. A second time the Brood with hooky Claws, And noisy Pinions, from their Coverts flock, And from a diff'rent Quarter of the Sky; And poison all our Feast. I then command The Soldiers to betake them to their Arms, And wage a War with That detested Race. Just as commanded, they obey; conceal Their Swords along the Grass, and hide their Shields. Soon as descending with a Noise they came Down on the crooked Shores, Misenus gave The Trumpet's Signal from a lofty Rock; Our Friends invade them, and new Battle try With Those Sea-Birds accurst: Upon their Plumes, And Bodies, no Impression they receive, Invulnerable; but beneath the Stars Speed their swift Flight, and leave the loathsom Print Of their foul Feet, and the half-eaten Prey. On a high Cliff alone Celæno sate, Unlucky Prophetess; and Thus she spoke. War too, ye Offspring of Laomedon, For slaughter'd Cattle, would you offer War? And drive the harmless Harpies from their Realms? Hear then, and in your Minds imprint my Words. What Jove to Phœbus, Phœbus taught to Me, The eldest Fury, I to You unfold. For Italy you sail, and court the Winds; At Italy you shall arrive, and there Enter the Port: But never with it's Walls Your fatal, promis'd City shall inclose; 'Till Famine dire, and Vengeance for our Wrongs Force you for Food your Dishes to devour. This said; with out-stretch'd Pinions back she flew Into the Wood. Our Friends with sudden Fear Are struck; Their Courage sinks, their Blood congeals: And now no more of Arms; With Pray'rs, and Vows They sue for Peace; whate'er Those Forms should prove, Whether dire Goddesses, or Birds obscene. But old Anchises, stretching from the Shore His Hands, invokes the mighty Gods, devoting Their Honours due: Ye Gods, forbid these Threats, Avert such Ills, and save a pious Race. He then commands to cut the twisted Cords, And loose from Shore; the Southern Blasts extend Our Sails; We fly upon the foaming Deep; Which way soe'er our Pilot and the Winds Direct our Course. And now amidst the Sea, Woody Zacynthos to our Sight appears; Dulichium, Same, Neritos with Rocks Lofty: We fly the Cliffs of Ithaca, Laertian Realms; and curse the native Soil Of dire Ulysses. Next the cloudy Tops Of Mount Leucate rise, and Phœbus' Fane Dreaded by Mariners: We thither turn Fatigu'd; and to the little Town proceed. Our Anchors from the Prow are cast; The Sterns Stand resting on the Shore. Beyond our hopes Arriving here, we sacrifice to Jove; And with the promis'd Fires his Altars blaze. We celebrate upon the Actian Coasts The Trojan Games: Our Friends along the Shore With Trojan Wrestling exercise their Limbs Naked, in slipp'ry Oil: They pleas'd reflect On having pass'd so many Grecian Towns, And steer'd the middle Course among our Foes. Meanwhile the Sun rolls round the circling Year; And icy Winter, harsh with Northern Winds, Roughens the Sea: A Shield of hollow Brass Which mighty Abas bore, upon the Posts Adverse I fix; and This Inscription leave: These Arms Æneas from the conqu'ring Greeks. I then command our Crew to leave the Port, And ply their Oars; With emulation fir'd They dash the Sea, and sweep the briny Waves. We soon lose Sight of high Phæacia's Tow'rs, And coasting skim along Epirus' Shores; Enter Chaonia's Harbour; and ascend Buthrotus, lofty City. There a Fame Of Things incredible surpriz'd our Ears; That Trojan Helenus o'er Grecian Towns Reign'd King, succeeding Pyrrhus; and possess'd His Queen, and Throne: and that Andromache Again was Consort to a Trojan Lord. Amaz'd I burn with strong Desire, to greet My Friend, and certain hear the strange Event. I leave our Crew, our Navy, and the Port. It chanc'd that then before the City's Walls, Close in a Grove, near fancy'd Simois' Stream, Andromache the mournful Off'rings paid, And solemn Sacrifice at Hector's Tomb, His empty Tomb; which, with two Altars built On the green Turf, th'Incentives of her Grief, She consecrated; and with Tears invok'd His Manes. Me as soon as she beheld Advancing towards her, and round me saw The Trojan Arms; confounded, and amaz'd, She stiffen'd at the Sight, and fainting fell: After long time, at length scarce, fault'ring, spoke. Your true Appearance? Come you, Goddess born, Real, t'inform me? Live you? Or, if dead, Where's Hector? Drown'd in Tears she spoke, and fill'd The Place with Shrieks. To her o'erpower'd, with pain I speak, and in few Words perplex'd reply. I live indeed; and thro' all Perils drag My Being; Doubt it not; for all you see Is real. You, torn alas! from such a Lord, what Chance Befalls? Or else what Fortune more deserv'd? And are You then, Hector's Andromache, Become the Spouse of Pyrrhus? Prone to Earth She bent her Eyes, and with low Voice reply'd. O! happy She, That Priameïan Maid, Happy above the rest! who, doom'd to die Beneath Troy's Walls, before an hostile Tomb, Fell by no Lot to any Victor's Share; Nor e'er ascended, as a Captive Queen, His lordly Bed. I, toss'd thro' various Seas, Far from my ruin'd Country, have endur'd The haughty Achilléan Race, and bore A Son in Servitude to That proud Youth; Who afterwards, preferring in his Choice Grecian Hermione, a Spartan Bride, Transmitted me a Captive, to the Bed Of Captive Helenus. But him, inflam'd With Love, and Vengeance for his ravish'd Bride, And wild with Guilt, Orestes unawares Surpriz'd, and at his Country-Altars slew. By Pyrrhus' Death the Kingdoms fell in part Assign'd to Helenus; who all the Realms From Trojan Chaon's Name Chaonia call'd, And on These Mountains built the Trojan Tow'rs. But You what Winds, what Fates have hither driv'n? What God has brought you to our Coasts unknown? How fares the young Ascanius? Does he live? Does he yet live, and breath this vital Air? Whom you, when Troy ? Do's yet the Boy with Grief remember aught Of his lost Mother? Does he, fir'd with Deeds Of manly Virtue, copy out his Sire Æneas, and his Uncle Hector's Fame? Weeping she spoke; and long Laments in vain Protracted: When the Priameïan Prince, Helenus, from the Town attended came, With numerous Retinue. Soon he knows, And owns his Friends, and joyful to his Walls Conducts them; interrupting, all the Way, His Speech with mingled Tears. I go, and view His little Troy, Resemblance of the Great; View the dry Banks of new-nam'd Xanthus' Stream, And hug the Lintels of the Scæan Gate. Nor less the Trojans share the friendly Town: Them in large stately Rooms the King receives; In the mid Court they feast with Bowls of Wine, With massy Plate, and Banquets serv'd in Gold. And now two Days were pass'd; the Winds invite Our Canvass, and extend the swelling Sails; Thus to the Prophet I address my Pray'r. Trojan Interpreter of Heav'n, whose Skill The sacred Oracle of Phœbus knows, His Tripos, and his Laurel-Wreath, the Stars, The Tongues of Birds, and Omens of their Flight; Instruct me: For the Gods propitious all My Voyage taught; and all their sacred Shrines Persuaded me to seek th'Italian Coasts, And find the Realms reserv'd for me by Fate. Only Celæno, Harpy dire, predicts Strange Prodigy; and (horrible to tell!) Denounces vengeful Wrath, and Famine, Plague Obscene. What Perils must I first escape? And by what means surmount such mighty Toils? Here Helenus, performing first the Rite Accustom'd, sacrificing Oxen slain, Implores the Favour of the Gods, unbinds The Fillets of his consecrated Head; And me sollicitous, in deep suspense Revolving various Oracles, he leads Strait to Thy Dome, O Phœbus: Then the Priest Divine Thus opens his prophetick Mouth. O Goddess-born, (For that you stem the Deep Under the Conduct of the mightier Pow'rs, Is manifest; So stands the Purpose fix'd Of Jove, and such the Scheme of Fate's Decree:) Few, among many, Things I will disclose; That safe you may explore These foreign Seas, And in th'Ausonian Harbour safe arrive: The Fates permit not Helenus to know The rest; and Juno's Pow'r forbids to speak. First, from th'Italian Ports, which you so near Imagine, ignorant, a long Extent Of Ocean, and a Voyage difficult Divide you: First Trinacrian Waves must bend Your Oars; Ausonian Seas must be explor'd, Th'infernal Lakes, Ææan Circe's Isle; E'er you on Land secure can found your Walls. The Sign I will foretell; Keep you in Mind What I disclose. When anxious for your Fate You shall beneath the Willows, on the Shore, Fast by the secret River's gliding Stream, Find a white Sow, and round her Teats her Young Of the same Colour, lying on the Ground, Thirty in Number; That shall be the Place To found your City; There your certain Rest From Toils. Nor you the future Famine fear, Nor Dishes for your Food: The Fates will find A Way; and Phœbus, when invok'd, assist. But These near Borders of th'Italian Coasts, Which next to Us are bounded by our Seas, Avoid: The Cities by the hostile Greeks Are all inhabited. The Locrians here, Narician Colony, have built their Walls; And with an armed Force Salentum's Fields Lyctian Idomeneus has there possess'd: Here Philoctetes, Melibœan Chief, Little Petilia with a Wall secures. But when your Ships rest wasted o'er the Main; And you on Altars rais'd along the Shore Pay your vow'd Off'rings; with a purple Veil Cover your Head: left any hostile Face Appearing, should disturb the solemn Rites, The holy Fires, and Honour of the Gods. This Form in Sacrificing let your Friends With You observe; and let your future Race Pious in this Religion persevere. But when the Wind shall to Sicilia's Coast Direct your Course, and strait Pelorus shew It's narrow Passage; by a Circuit wide Veer to the Left, the Left to Land and Sea; Avoid the Right of Both. These Lands, 'tis said, (So great the Changes made by Tract of Time) With Ruin vast, and mighty Force convuls'd Asunder broke: When Both were join'd in one Continuous, intermediate came the Sea With Rage impetuous; and with rushing Waves Tore all Hesperia from Sicilia's Shores, And by a narrow Frith the Fields and Towns Divided. Scylla guards the Right, the Left Implacable Charybdis; which, with Gulf Voracious, thrice sucks in the broken Tides; Then spouts them high, disgorg'd, into the Air, Alternate, and with Billows beats the Stars. But Scylla, with dark Caverns round inclos'd, Uprears her Head, and draws among her Rocks The Vessels: Human is her upper Part, A Virgin's beauteous Face, and beauteous Breast, Her nether Shape a monstrous Pristis join'd To Tails of Dolphins, and the Wombs of Wolves. 'Tis better to survey Trinacria's Bounds, And coast Pachynus, and with Voyage wide To steer a winding Course; than once to see In her vast Cave huge Scylla's hideous Form, And Rocks rebellowing with cerulean Dogs. Besides; If Helenus has any Skill, If any Faith, and if Apollo right Inspires his Prophet; One thing, Goddess-born, One thing, above the rest, I will advise, And oft repeat it: With religious Pray'r First Juno's Deity adore; to Her Pay willing Sacrifices, and with Vows Suppliant o'erpow'r the mighty Queen of Heav'n; So, leaving Sicily, you shall at last In Safety land upon th'Ausonian Shore. When thither brought, you shall at Cumæ's Walls Arrive, and entring see th'Avernian Lake, The Lake Divine, resounding in the Woods; A Prophetess you shall behold, with Rage Enthusiastick, who beneath a Rock Discloses Fate; and Characters, and Verse Commits to Leaves. Whatever Lines on Leaves The Virgin writes, she into Order just Ranges, and lays them in her Grot secluse; They in their Places rest unmov'd: But when, The Door turn'd on it's Hinge, a Blast of Wind Disturbs their Site; she never is concern'd To catch them flying in her hollow Rock; Never recalls them to their former Cells, And marshals them no more: The Votaries Depart untaught, and curse the Sibyl's Cave. But let no Loss sustain'd by your Delay, However great, deter you: Tho' your Friends Impatient murmur, and the prosp'rous Gales Invite your swelling Canvass; yet address The holy Priestess, and with suppliant Pray'r Intreat her to reveal your Fate by Speech, By vocal Accents. She th'Inhabitants Of Italy, and all your future Wars Will teach, and how to suffer, or escape Your ev'ry Labour: She, ador'd, will speed Your Voyage. These are all the Things, which Fate Permits my Voice t'inform you: Go, and raise Great Troy, by deathless Actions, to the Stars. Thus when the friendly Prophet had advis'd; He gives Command to carry to our Ships Presents of polish'd Iv'ry, pond'rous Gold, And Dodonæan Cauldrons, massy Plate, A Coat of Mail compact with Hooks, and all With triple Tissue wrought; a Helmet's Cone With nodding Crest, the Helmet Pyrrhus wore: My Father too with Presents he adorns, Adds Steeds, and Pilots; Refits our Oars, supplies our Crew with Arms. Mean-while Anchises gives Command to spread Our Canvass, nor retard the willing Winds. Him with much Honour Thus the Royal Priest Bespeaks. Anchises, favour'd with the Bed Of Venus, Darling of the Gods, and twice Rescu'd from ruin'd Troy; Before your Eyes Behold Ausonia; make it with your Sails: Yet still your Fleet must cruise along Those Coasts; Far distant is That Part of Italy, Which by Apollo is disclos'd: Go, blest In your Son's Piety; Why speak I more? And with my Words delay the rising Winds? Nor less Andromache, with sad Farewel, Brings to Ascanius Robes all wrought in Gold With various Colours, and a Phrygian Cloak; Loads him with rich embroider'd Vestments, nought Inferiour in her Presents: Then she speaks. Thou too, dear Youth, These Labours of my Hands Receive, which long may testify the Love Of Hector's Wife Andromache; Accept These, the last Presents which thy Friends can give: O Thou! the sole, surviving Image left Of my Astyanax! Just so he look'd! Such were his Gestures! such his Eyes, and Hands! And now his Age had bloom'd with equal Years. These at our last Farewell I thus address, With rising Tears: Live happy, You, whose Toils Already are completed: We from Fate To Fate are summon'd; You have found your Rest: You have no Ocean's wide Extent to plough, No Italy, still flying, to pursue. Xanthus in Imag'ry you see, and Troy Which your own Hands have made; with more Success, I hope, and less obnoxious to the Greeks. If ever Tyber, and it's neighb'ring Fields I see, and Walls allotted us by Fate; Epirus, and Hesperia, kindred Realms, By the same Founder Dardanus ally'd, Ally'd by Fortune, we in future Times Will in Affections make one Troy; and That Shall be the Care of all our future Race. Close by Ceraunia's neighb'ring Coasts we sail; From whence the nearest Passage o'er the Sea To Italy. Mean-while the Sun declines, And Ev'ning shades the Hills. Appointing Guards By Lot to watch on Board, along the Shore Upon the wish'd-for Land, we rest our Limbs, And dewy Sleep relieves them. Nor as yet Had Night, roll'd on by Hours, compleated half It's Course: when Palinurus from his Bed Rises industrious; all the Winds explores, And in his Ear receives the Blasts; observes The Stars all sliding in the silent Sky, The rainy Hyades, and either Bear, Arcturus, and Orion arm'd with Gold. When all the Face of Heav'n he sees serene; He gives the sounding Signal from his Ship: We strike our Tents, and spread the Canvass Wings. And now the Morning redden'd, and the Stars Retreated; When at distance we beheld The Hills obscure, and low Italian Plains. Italia, first Achates crys aloud; Italia all our Crew with joyful Shouts Salute. Anchises then a Goblet crowns, Fills it with Wine, and standing on the Deck Aloft, invokes the Gods. Ye Gods, Controulers of the Land, the Seas, And Tempests; speed our Voyage by the Winds, And breathe propitious. Strait the wish'd-for Gales Swell fresh: The Harbour opens to our View Now nearer; and Minerva's Temple high Upon the Mountain rises to the Sight. Our Crew contract their Sails, and make to Shore: The Harbour Eastward bends into an Arch; The Rocks foam, opposite, with dashing Waves; Itself retires, and with a double Wall The craggy Cliffs, rais'd high like Tow'rs, let down Their Arms; And from the Shore the Temple flies. Four Steeds (our first of Omens) here I saw Of snow-white Colour, grazing on the Fields: Then old Anchises; War, O foreign Land, Thou dost denounce: These Steeds are arm'd for War. But since accustom'd to the Rein they drew The Chariot, and concordant Harness bore; There still is Hope of Peace. We suppliant pray To warlike Pallas; who receiv'd us first Joyous; and here before the Altars wrap Our Heads in Phrygian Veils: With solemn Rites We then obey th'important Precepts giv'n By Helenus; and, as by him advis'd, To Grecian Juno pay the Honours due. Our Vows religious orderly perform'd; With quick Dispatch we shift our Sails, and leave The Grecian Mansions, and suspected Fields. Then next Tarentum's Bay is seen, renown'd (If Fame be true) from Hercules: Oppos'd To That, Lacinia's Temple rears it's Head; And Caulon's Tow'rs; and Scylacæum fear'd For Shipwrecks. Next, at distance, from the Main, Trinacrian Ætna rises to our View; The bellowing Sea, and beaten Rocks are heard From far, and Noises breaking on the Shore: The Shallows boil, and mix the Tide with Sand. This is Charybdis, old Anchises crys; These Helenus foretold, These dang'rous Rocks. Veer off, my Friends; together ply your Oars. Just as commanded, they obey; And first The Fore-deck Palinurus to the Left Turns round; Our gen'ral Crew with Oars, and Sails, Make to the Left: High on a vaulted Wave We mount to Heav'n; That sinking, down we fall, Down to th'infernal Shades; Thrice roar'd the Rocks Among their hollow Caverns; Thrice we saw The dashing, broken Foam, and sprinkled Stars. Mean-while, amidst our Toils, the Wind, and Sun Forsake us; And, unknowing of our Course, We drive upon the Cyclops' Coasts: The Port Fenc'd by it's Situation from the Winds, And large itself: But Ætna Thunders nigh In dreadful Ruins. With a Whirlwind's force Sometimes it throws to Heav'n a pitchy Cloud, Redden'd with Cinders, and involv'd in Smoke; And tosses Balls of Flame, and licks the Stars. Sometimes with loud Explosion high it hurls Vast Rocks, and Entrails from the Mountain torn; With roaring Noise slings molten Stones in Air, And boils, and bellows, from it's lowest Caves. 'Tis said, the Bulk of huge Enceladus Blasted with Light'ning, by This pond'rous Mount Is crush'd; and Ætna, o'er him whelm'd, expires Flame from it's burst Volcano's: And whene'er He shifts his weary Side, Trinacria all Groans trembling, and with Smoke obscures the Sky. Shelter'd in Woods, that Night we bore the strange And monstrous Prodigies; nor saw from whence Those Noises came: For neither did the Stars Appear, nor Light in all th'Expanse of Heav'n: But Clouds o'ercast the Sky; and Dead of Night Confin'd the Moon in Darkness. Now the Day Returning with the Morning-Star arose, And from the Pole Aurora's Dawn dispell'd The dewy Shades: When issuing from the Woods A strange unusual Figure of a Man, With Looks emaciated, and wretched Garb, Makes to the Shore, and suppliant spreads his Hands. We turn ourselves, to mark him; Hideous Filth, A Length of Beard, and Garments tagg'd with Thorns; But for the rest, a Greek; and sent to Troy In Grecian Wars. When he at distance saw The Trojan Habits, and the Trojan Arms; He stop'd a-while, confounded at the Sight; Then headlong to the Shore, with Tears, and Pray'rs, Flings himself forward: By the Stars, by Heav'n, You I conjure, and by This vital Air, Take me, Ye Trojans; to whatever Climes You please, transport me; That will be enough: One, I confess, I am of Grecian Race, And came a Warriour to the Walls of Troy. For which, if so That Injury require, If such my Guilt; Disperse my mangled Limbs O'er the wide Ocean: If I die, 'twill prove Some Consolation, that I die by Men. He said; and fix'd, and grov'ling on the Ground Embrac'd our Knees. We urge him to declare Who, and from whence he was, and how distress'd. My Father's self, Anchises, in his Thoughts Little deliberating, gives the Youth His Hand; and with That present Pledge confirms His wav'ring Mind: At length, reliev'd from Fear, He Thus proceeds. To Ithaca my Birth Is ow'd, and Achæmenides my Name; Companion of Ulysses' hapless Toils. Leaving my Father Adamastus, poor, (And would to Heav'n That Fortune had remain'd) I went to Troy. While here my frighted Friends Forsook the cruel Mansions; me they left, Unmindful, in the Cyclops' spacious Cave. Dark is th'interior Grot, and vast; besmear'd With Gore, and savage Feasts: Himself with Height Immeasurable, stalks, and beats the Stars, (Ye Gods, avert so great a Plague from Earth!) Dire to the Sight, by no Address, or Speech To be accosted. On raw, human Flesh, And clotted Blood, he feeds. I saw him, stretch'd In his mid Den, with Grasp prodigious seise Two of our Number, and their Bodies dash Against a Rock; The Floor bespatter'd swam In Brains, and Blood: I saw him, as he chew'd The Gobbets, dropping with black, ropy Gore; And Limbs, yet living, sprawl'd between his Teeth. Not unreveng'd indeed: nor did Ulysses Patient endure it; or forget himself In That Distress. For as He lay, with Neck Reclin'd, immense, extended in his Cave, Gorg'd with his Banquet, stupify'd with Wine, Belching out gory Morsels in his Sleep, Commix'd with crude, and indigested Draughts: We, having first invok'd the mighty Gods, And taking each his Post allotted, round Inclose him all; and with our sharpen'd Steel Bore out his broad, deep Eye, which single lay Then hid beneath his griesly, frowning Front, Wide as a Grecian Shield, or Phœbus' Lamp; And, pleas'd, revenge the Manes of our Friends. But fly, Ye Miserable; fly, and cut Your Cables from the Shore. For such, and huge, as Polypheme, who pens His fleecy Flocks, and milks them in his Cave, An hundred Cyclops more These winding Coasts Inhabit round, and o'er the Mountains rove. Thrice has the Moon renew'd her blunted Horns; Since here in Woods, among the desert Dens Of Beasts, I live; and from the Rocks behold The monstrous Cyclops, trembling at the Sound Of their big Voices, and their pond'rous Feet. Berries, and stony Sloes the Trees afford, Wretched Repast! and Herbage from the Mold Pluck'd by the Roots sustains me. Gazing round, Your Fleet I saw first steering to the Shore: To That I soon resolv'd myself to join, Whatever it should prove: It is enough To have escap'd the execrable Race; Do You by any Death. This Life destroy. He scarce had spoke; when on the Mountain's Top Himself we saw, th'enormous Polypheme, Shepherd among his Flocks, with Bulk immense Moving along, and seeking the known Shores. An eyeless Monster, hideous, vast, deform! A Pine's huge Trunk directs his Hand, and firms His Steps; His wooly Sheep attend his Walk, (Those were his sole Delight) and from his Neck His Pipe hangs down, the Solace of his Woe. Soon as he reach'd the Ocean's Waves profound; He rins'd his empty Socket from the Blood, Gnashing his Teeth with Groans: Then stalk'd along Thro' the mid Ocean; Nor did yet the Waves Tinge his tall Sides. We trembling speed our Flight With eager haste, receiving him on Board, At his Request, who had so well deserv'd; And silent cut the Cords, and sweep the Sea With struggling Oars. He heard; and to the Sound Quick turn'd his steps: But when he found his Hand Short of it's Reach affected, and no Pow'r To ford in close Pursuit th'Iönian Gulf; He rais'd a hideous Yell; at which the Sea Trembled, and all it's Waves: Italia quak'd; And Ætna bellow'd from it's winding Caves. Rous'd by the Noise, the whole Cyclopean Race Rush from the Woods, and Mountains, to the Port; And fill the Shore. We see th'Ætnæan Brood (Dreadful Assembly!) stand, and sternly roll Their Eyes in vain, and rear their tow'ring Heads To Heav'n: As when, upon a Mountain's Top, Aërial Oaks, or Cypress-Cones stand high, The Thicket of Diana, or of Jove. Fear wings our Friends precipitate, to tack To any Point, and turn our Sails where-e'er The Wind permits: But contrary th'Advice Of Helenus directs them not to run 'Twixt Scylla, and Charybdis, either way Bord'ring on Death: Consulting we resolve Backwards to bend our Course. When Boreas, sent From strait Pelorus, blows: I sail along Close by Pantagia's Mouth of living Stone, Megara's narrow Frith, and Tapsus low; Such Coasts were shewn by Achæmenides Companion of Ulysses' hapless Toils, Which he before had wander'd, now review'd. Against Sicania's Bay an Island lies, Oppos'd to rough Plemmyrium, nam'd of old Ortygia: Here, 'tis said, Alphëus, Stream Of Elis, underneath the Ocean urg'd His secret Way; now rushing thro' thy Mouth, O Arethusa, in Sicilia's Sea Loses his blended Waves. Advis'd, we pray The mighty Deities who There preside: And thence we pass along the fertil Soil Of stagnating Helorus; Thence the Cliffs Of high Pachynus stretch'd into the Main; And Camarina, made by Fate unmov'd, Appears at distance; The Geloian Fields, And spacious Gela from the River nam'd. Thence Agragas from far it's lofty Walls Uprears, the Breeder once of gen'rous Steeds. Thee too, with full extended Sails I leave, Palmy Selinus; and the hidden Rocks In Lilybéum's stony Shallows. Thence The Port of Drepanum, a joyless Coast, Receives me. Here alas! so many Storms Escap'd, I lose the Solace of my Toils, My Sire Anchises: Here you leave me, Best Of Fathers, from such Dangers sav'd in vain. Nor did Prophetick Helenus, amidst So great a Number of predicted Woes, Nor dire Celæno, That hard Fate foretel. This was my last of Labours; This the Bound Of my long Travels: Parting hence I came, By Providence directing, to your Coasts. Thus Prince Æneas, while All silent sate, Alone related the Decrees of Heav'n, And his own Voyages describ'd: He stop'd At length, and ending here retir'd to Rest. The End of the Third Book. BOOK the Fourth. But with consuming Care the restless Queen Already bleeding, nourishes a Wound Deep in her Veins, and wastes with hidden Fire. Much to her Thoughts the Heroe's brave Exploits Recur, and much the Glories of his Race; Fix'd in her Soul his Looks, and Words remain; And lost Repose is banish'd from her Breast. Now had returning Morn illum'd the World With Phœbus' Lamp, and from the Pole dispell'd The dewy Shades; when, sick with fond Desire, Her Confident, her Sister, she bespeaks. What Dreams, my dearest Anna, discompose My Rest? What wond'rous Stranger at our Court Is here arriv'd! how God-like he appears! In Mien how graceful! and how brave in Arms! For me, I think (nor groundless are Those Thoughts) His Lineage is Divine. Unmanly Fear Argues degen'rate Souls: What Fates, alas! Have him pursu'd! What Battles did he tell! Were not my Soul immoveably resolv'd Never to link my self in Nuptial Bonds, Since my first Love deluded me by Death; Did I not sicken at the Sound of Wedlock: To This one Frailty I perhaps could yield. My Sister (for to Thee I will disclose My inmost Thoughts) since poor Sichæus fell, And with his Blood, spilt by a Brother's Hand, Sprinkled our Houshold-Gods; This only Man Has warp'd my Inclinations, and unfix'd My stagg'ring Resolution: I perceive The Signs and Tokens of my former Flame. But may the yawning Earth devour me quick; Or Jove with Thunder strike me to the Shades, Pale Shades of Erebus, and Night profound; E'er, Modesty, I break Thy sacred Laws, Or violate Thy Rights: He, who at first Made me his own, bore all my Love away: Let him possess it to himself entire, And keep it in his Grave. Thus having said, She fill'd her Bosom with o'erflowing Tears. Anna replies: O dearer than This Light To me; will You alone waste all your Youth In pining Grief? Nor know the dear Delights Of Children, and the sweet Rewards of Love? Think you That Care disturbs departed Ghosts, Or bury'd Ashes? What, tho' heretofore No soft Addresses your sad Soul could move, Not here in Libya, nor before, at Tyre? What tho' Iärbas was with Scorn repuls'd, And other Leaders, born on Africk Coasts Fertil in Triumphs? Ev'n a pleasing Love Will you resist? Nor think what Countries round Inclose you? Here Getulian Towns, a Race Invincible in War; the fierce, untam'd Numidians, and th'inhospitable Sands Of Syrtis: There, a Region wild, and waste By parching Heat; then raging far, and wide, Th'unciviliz'd Barcæans: Not to name The War from Tyre impending, and the Threats Of our fierce Brother? Sure 'twas indulgent Heav'n's peculiar Care, And Juno's Providence, that hither brought The Trojan Fleet. How fam'd a City This Will you behold! How flourishing a Realm By such Connubials! By the Trojan Arms United to our own, to what a Height Of Greatness will the Punic Glory rise! Only do you with Pray'r propitiate Heav'n, Indulge your Hospitality, and frame New Reasons for their Stay; tempestuous Winds, Orion's stormy Influence on the Main, Their shatter'd Vessels, and th'inclement Sky. By such Advice she fan'd the Fire of Love Within her Sister's Soul; with Hope confirm'd Her wav'ring Mind, and broke thro' all Reserves. First to the Temple they repair, and seek Heav'n's Favour at the Altars: On them laid Selected Victims, with accustom'd Rites, To Ceres Law-giver, and Phœbus bleed, And Father Bacchus; but above the rest To Juno, who presides o'er Nuptial Beds. The beauteous Queen her self a Goblet holds In her Right hand, and for Libation pours The Wine betwixt the snow-white Heifer's Horns. Or round the smoking Altars slowly walks Before the Statues of the Gods; with Gifts Renews the Day; and on the open'd Breasts Of Victims eagerly intent, consults Their breathing Entrails. Wretched Ignorance Of Augurs! What alas! do Vows, or Shrines Avail, to heal her Frenzy? A soft Flame Feeds on her Vitals; and a living Wound Silent, unseen, bleeds inward in her Breast. Th'unhappy Dido burns, and restless roves O'er all the City: Like a wounded Deer, Whom heedless of her Fate, in Cretian Woods, The Swain at distance with his Shafts pursu'd; And in her Body left the missive Steel, Unknowing: She thro' the Dictæan Groves, And Thickets flying strays; the mortal Dart Sticks in her Side. Sometimes the Trojan Prince She takes alone, and leads him round the Walls; With Ostentation shews him, as they walk, Her rising City, and Sidonian Wealth; Begins to speak, and in the Middle stops Her fault'ring Tongue. At Ev'ning she renews Her Banquets; fondly begs again to hear The Trojan Wars: again, while He relates, She listens fix'd, and hangs upon the Sound. Then after all are to their Rest retir'd: When in her turn the Moon obscure withdraws Her Light, and setting Stars persuade to Sleep: Lonely she pines within the empty Court, Lies on the Couch which just before she left; Him absent, absent still she hears, and sees. Sometimes, his Father's Image all her Soul Possessing, young Ascanius on her Lap She long detains; if possible, to cheat With That Amusement her unbounded Love. Th'unfinish'd Tow'rs no longer rise; The Youth, Undisciplin'd in Arms, no longer form Ports, and strong Fortresses of War; The Works Neglected stand: The Threat'nings of the Walls, And tall Machines no more invade the Sky; But, sticking in mid way, come short of Heav'n. Whom when the Wife of Jove perceives involv'd In such a Pest of Passion, nor by Fame It self restrain'd; to Venus Thus she speaks. Prodigious Trophies you indeed have gain'd, You, and your Boy; vast Praise, a deathless Name: If by the Fraud of Two Celestial Pow'rs One Woman be subdu'd. And well I know Our rising Carthage you suspect, and fear. But where at last will This Contention end? Why rather make we not eternal Peace, And binding Nuptials? What your Soul desir'd You have effected: Dido fondly burns; And Love's soft Frenzy revels in her Veins. Then let This People by our joint Command Be rul'd; Let Dido serve a Phrygian Lord, And give in Dow'r her Tyrians to your Hand. To whom Thus Venus (for she well perceiv'd The Fraud of Juno, lab'ring to transfer Th'Italian Kingdom to the Libyan Coasts) Reply'd. Who ill-advis'd would e'er reject Such fair Demands, and rather chuse with you Still to contend? Did Fortune but approve, And second your Design: But I, unskill'd In Fate's Decrees, am doubtful whether Jove Permit the Colonies of Tyre, and Troy To join their Kingdoms, and unite in One. You are his Consort, and have Privilege To sound his Thoughts; I follow, as you lead. To whom Imperial Juno Thus reply'd. Mine be That Care: At present (mark my Words) How what th'immediate Stress of Things requires May be effected, I'll in brief unfold. Soon as to-morrow's Sun his rising Beams Extends; Æneas, and th'unhappy Queen Design to hunt among the Libyan Woods. On These, when all are on their Sport intent, And with their Toils the Thickets round inclose, I from above will pour a Storm with Hail Commix'd, and roll loud Thunder o'er the Sky. Th'Attendants shall be scatter'd, and conceal'd In Darkness: Dido, and the Trojan Chief To the same Grot shall come; I'll there attend, And, if your Thoughts approve it, join her firm In Nuptial Bonds, and consecrate her His: Here Hymen shall be present. Not averse From this Proposal, Venus gives Consent, Sees thro' her Project, and in secret smiles. Mean-while Aurora, rising, leaves the Sea: Forth from the Gates the chosen Youth advance, With Nets, and Toils, broad-pointed hunting Spears, Massylian Horsemen, and quick-scented Hounds. Before her Gates the Punic Nobles wait The Queen, delaying in her rich Alcove; Her Steed, adorn'd with Purple, and with Gold, Stands pawing, fierce, and champs the foaming Bit. At length, attended with a num'rous Guard, She comes Majestick: Her Sidonian Vest Border'd with crimson Fringe; her Quiver, Gold; Her Tresses in a golden Knot confin'd; A golden Buckle clasps her purple Robe. Join'd to the rest the Trojan Youth advance, And glad Iülus: But, above them all, Beauteous, and Eminent, Æneas comes; And, adding his Retinue, fills the Train. As when Apollo leaves his Winter-Seat Lycia, and Xanthus' Stream; and in it's Turn Visits his Native Delos, to restore The Festivals; About his Altars croud, With mingled Noise, the Cretians, Dryopes, And painted Agathyrsi: He on Top Of Cynthus walks, and crowns his flowing Hair With a soft Wreath of Greens, forms it with Art, And winds it up in Gold; His sounding Shafts Hang at his Shoulders. No less graceful mov'd Æneas; In his Face such Beauty shone. When to the Hills, and pathless Haunts of Beasts They come; Driv'n downwards from the Tops of Rocks The wild Goats run: In other parts the Deer Scour o'er the spacious Champain, flying join Their Troops in Clouds of Dust, and leave the Hills. But young Ascanius, thro' the winding Vales, Rejoices in his mettled Steed; now These, Now Those out-rides: among th'ignoble Herd Of Beasts, desires to see a foaming Boar, Or tawny Lion from the Hills descend. Mean-while the mustring Clouds with grumbling Sound Disturb the Sky: A Storm with mingled Hail Ensues; The Tyrians, and the Trojan Youth, And Venus' Grandson, flying o'er the Fields Seek various Shelter: Down the Mountains rush The Torrents. Dido, and the Trojan Chief To the same Grot together come: And first Earth, and contracting Juno gave the Sign; Flashes of ruddy Light'ning glar'd; The Sky Was conscious of th'Alliance; And the Nymphs Shriek'd on the Mountain's Top. That Day was first The Cause of Death, and Woes: For Dido now Neither by Decency, nor Fame is mov'd; Nor longer studies to conceal her Love, But skreens the Guilt with Wedlock's specious Name. Forthwith loud Fame thro' Libyan Cities goes, Fame, a pernicious Pest, than whom more swift Is none; She flying grows, and gathers Strength By Motion: Small at first thro' Fear; in time She rears herself in Air, walks on the Ground And hides her tow'ring Head among the Clouds. Her, the last Sister to Enceladus, And Cæus, as 'tis said, the Parent Earth, Provok'd by Anger of the Gods, brought forth, Swift in her Feet, and never-weary'd Wings. A Monster hideous, vast! As many Plumes As in her Body stick, so many Eyes For ever waking (wond'rous to relate!) There grow beneath; as many babbling Tongues; As many list'ning Ears. By Night she flies, Noisy, thro' Shades obscure, 'twixt Earth and Heav'n; Nor are her Eyes by pleasing Slumber clos'd. Watchful, and spying round, by Day, she sits On some high Palace-Top, or lofty Tow'r, And mighty Towns alarms; no less intent On spreading Falshood, than reporting Truth. She then with various Rumour fills the Croud, Pleas'd with her Task, and mingles Truth with Lyes. Relates that one Æneas, sprung from Troy, Was come; To whom fair Dido could descend To wed herself: Now all the Winter's Length They indulge between them in luxurious Love, Regardless of their Kingdoms, and enslav'd By brutal Appetite. With Talk like This The shameless Goddess fills the Mouths of Men. To King Iärbas strait she bends her Course, Inflames his Soul, and aggravates his Rage. He, born of Ammon, and a ravish'd Nymph Of Garamantic Race, to mighty Jove An hundred spacious Temples, in his Realms Of wide Extent, an hundred Altars built; And consecrated to the Gods the Hearths Of everlasting Fire; the Ground with Blood Of slaughter'd Victims smoking; and the Doors With various-colour'd flow'ry Wreaths adorn'd. He, wild with Rage, and at the stabbing News Incens'd, among the Statues of the Gods, Before the Altars, with uplifted Hands, To Jove Thus supplicant his Suit address'd. Almighty Jove, to whom the Moorish Race, Feasting on broider'd Beds, pour richest Wine; Seest thou These Things? Or groundless are our Fears Of Thunder? Do thy Light'nings from the Clouds Scare us in vain, and idle Murmurs roll? A Woman here, who, wand'ring in our Coasts, A little City built on purchas'd Ground, To whom on our Conditions we allow'd A Tract of Tillage-Land, has scorn'd my Love, And Lord Æneas to her Throne receiv'd. And now That other Paris, with his soft Half-female Train, his Lydian Bonnet bound Beneath his Chin, his Hair perfum'd with Oils, Enjoys the Prize; while we with Gifts supply Your Temples, and maintain an empty Name. Him, as he thus before his Altars pray'd, Th'Almighty heard; and turn'd his awful Eyes To Carthage-Turrets, and the princely Pair Of Lovers, heedless of their better Fame. Then Mercury he Thus instructs: Dispatch, My Son, invite the Winds, on Pinions glide; And to the Trojan Chief, who loiters now At Carthage, and forgets the Realms by Fate Allotted to him, These my Words convey, And wing my Message thro' the fleeting Air. Tell him, his beauteous Mother did not promise A Son like Him; whom not for This she twice Rescu'd from Grecian Jav'lins: But a Prince, Who Italy should rule, a Nation big With Empires, fierce, and terrible in War; Should by his Deeds assert th'illustrious Blood Of Teucer, and to all the World give Laws. If by the Fame of so sublime a Fate He is not fir'd; and will no Toil endure For his own Glory: Does the Father's Love Envy Ascanius Rome's Imperial Tow'rs? What does he he purpose? with what Prospect stay Among That hostile People? nor regard The rich Lavinian Fields, and future Race Destin'd to rule Ausonia? Bid him sail; This is the Sum; be This my dread Command. He said; The Son, preparing to obey His mighty Father's Will, first to his Feet Fast binds the golden Sandals, which on Wings Bear him aloft, as o'er the Seas, or Earth He flies, and round him whirls the rapid Air. Then takes his Wand: With This pale Ghosts he calls From Hell; sends others to Those dreary Realms; Gives, or breaks Sleep; and Eyes unseals from Death. Equipp'd with This, he drives the Winds, and cuts Th'opposing turbid Mists; and now discerns, In his swift Flight, the Top, and lofty Sides Of rocky Atlas, who sustains the Sky. Atlas, whose piny Head with low'ring Clouds Is wrap'd, and beaten with the Winds, and Rain: Snow hides his Shoulders; from his hoary Chin Streams roll, and stiffen'd hangs his icy Beard. Here first Cyllenius, pois'd on even Wings, Alighted; Thence with all his Body's force, Flings himself headlong from the steepy Height Down to the Ocean: Like the Bird that flies, Low, skimming o'er the Surface, near the Sea, Around the Shores, around the fishy Rocks: So Mercury in Air, 'twixt Earth and Heav'n, Shooting from his maternal Grandsire, flew, And cut the Winds, and Libya's sandy Shore. Soon as he There with wingy Feet arriv'd; He saw Æneas busily empoly'd In buildings Forts, and Streets: A Sword he wore Studded with Jasper; and a Gown, that flam'd With Tyrian Crimson, from his Shoulders hung; A Present which the Royal Dido gave, And wrought the vary'd Silk with Threads of Gold. Strait he invades him: Thou art then engag'd To build, and beautify fair Carthage-Tow'rs, Uxorious Man! ah! thoughtless! unconcern'd For thy own Kingdom, and thy own Affairs. The Sov'reign of the Sky, whose awful Nod Shakes Earth, and Heav'n, has sent me from above, From bright Olympus: His Commands I bring, And waft his Message thro' the fleeting Air. What dost thou purpose? with what Prospect waste Thy Time, unactive, on These Libyan Coasts? If by the Fame of so sublime a Fate Thou art not mov'd, and wilt no Toil endure For thy own Glory; yet at least regard Thy Heir Ascanius, and his rising Hopes; To whom th'Italian and the Roman Realms Are due from Fate. When Hermes Thus had spoke; In his mid Speech abrupt he far withdrew From mortal Sight, and vanish'd into Air. Confounded, and amaz'd, Æneas stood: Up rose his Hair erect; and to his Mouth His Speech with Horrour cleav'd. He longs to go, And leave That pleasing Kingdom, Thunder-struck At such a Message, and the God's Command. What should he do? With what soft Words attempt To sooth th'impatient Queen? How introduce The first Discourse? His wav'ring Mind divides A thousand ways; now This, now That resolves, And turns on ev'ry Side it's shifting Thoughts. At length This Resolution he approves: Mnestheus he calls, Sergestus, and the brave Cloanthus; bids them privately prepare The Fleet, and draw their Forces to the Shore; Provide all fit Materials; and conceal The Cause of such an unexpected Change: Tells them, that while th'indulgent Queen remain'd Unapprehensive, ignorant, nor fear'd That Loves so well confirm'd could be dissolv'd; He would explore th'Approaches to her Soul, Watch all the softest Seasons of Address, And think on proper Measures. These Commands With joyful Haste they eagerly obey, And execute his Orders. But the Queen (Who can delude a Lover?) Soon perceiv'd The Fraud, and first his future Motions saw, Fearing ev'n Safety: The same impious Pest, Fame, gave her the Alarm; the Fleet was rigg'd, And all prepar'd to sail. Distracted, wild, She rages; and, incens'd, o'er all the Town Roves, like a Bacchanal; when at the Name Of Bacchus, his triennial Orgies swell Her Breast with Madness; and Cythæron's Top Invites her, echoing with nocturnal Sounds. At length Æneas Thus she first bespeaks. And couldst thou hope, perfidious, to conceal So black a Crime? and silent leave my Coasts? Cannot my Love, nor thy once plighted Faith, Nor Dido's cruel, and untimely Death (For Death inevitable must ensue) Detain thee? Ev'n to Winter's scowling Sky Your Navy you expose, and haste to stem The Deep amidst tempestuous Northern Winds, Ah cruel! What, if Kingdoms not thy own Thou didst not seek, and still old Troy remain'd; Should Troy itself be sought o'er stormy Seas? Me dost thou fly? By These distilling Tears, By thy Right hand (since Nought else I've reserv'd To wretched Me) by our connubial Rites, And Hymenéal Loves but yet begun; If ever I have aught of thee deserv'd, Or any thing of mine was e'er to thee Delightful; pity my declining State; And oh! if yet there's any room for Pray'r, Be yet intreated, yet thy Purpose change. The Libyan Nations, for Thy sake incens'd, And fierce Numidian Tyrants are my Foes; My Tyrians too offended: For Thy sake My Honour is extinguish'd, lost; and That By which alone I soar'd above the World, My once unsully'd Fame: To whom by thee Dying am I abandon'd, cruel Guest? Since That's the only Name which now remains, Instead of Husband. Wherefore should I stay, 'Till my unnat'ral Brother lay my Walls In Ruin? Or Iärbas too his Realms Transport me Captive? Had I but from Thee Some Pledge before thy Flight; did any young Little Æneas play about my Hall, Expressing thee in Looks; I should not seem Entirely lost, forsaken, and betray'd. She said; He, aw'd by Jove's severe Command, Fix'd held his Eyes, and smother'd in his Breast The struggling Pain: At length in brief reply'd. Your Favours, great, and numerous, conferr'd On me, fair Queen, you justly may recount, Nor shall I once deny; nor e'er forget Elisa, while I'm mindful of myself; While Life inspires this Frame. In brief I'll speak, Full to the Cause: 'Twas never my Design (Misrepresent me not) to leave your Coasts With secresy; nor did I ever think Of Nuptial Rites, or such a Contract meant. Me did the Fates permit to lead my Life By my own Conduct, and compose my Cares To my own Wish; I had regarded first My Native Walls, and Ilium's dear Remains: Priam's high Palace had again been rear'd, And for my vanquish'd Country I had built New-rising Troy. But now Apollo's Shrines, Now Lycian Oracles direct my Course To Italy, our lov'd, our promis'd Realm. If You, a Tyrian Princess, are detain'd By Carthage-Tow'rs, and please yourself to see A Libyan City rising; who can grudge The Trojans Liberty to fix their Seat In Latium? Let Us too have Leave to seek A foreign Land. As oft as Night obscures The World with dewy Shades, and fiery Stars Rise in the Sky; my Father's troubled Ghost Admonishes, and frights me in my Dreams. My dear Ascanius chides me for my Stay; Whom of th'Hesperian Kingdom I defraud, And fatal destin'd Fields. Nay just ev'n now Th'Ambassadour of Heav'n from mighty Jove Dispatch'd, (I call to witness both Those Pow'rs) Brought me his Mandates thro' the fleeting Air: I saw the God in open Light of Day Entring your Walls; and in These Ears receiv'd His Voice. Disquiet not with vain Complaints Yourself, and me: 'Tis with Regret I seek Th'Italian Coasts. Thus while he spoke, she silently intent Ey'd him averse; and roll'd her glaring Balls Around; from head to foot survey'd him o'er, Speechless awhile; and Thus in Rage reply'd. Nor art thou of a Goddess-Mother born; Nor is thy Birth from Dardanus deriv'd, Perfidious Wretch: But Caucasus, with Rocks Horrid, disclos'd thee from it's flinty Sides, And fierce Hyrcanian Tygers gave thee suck. For why should I dissemble? Or what worse Can I expect? Did he once give a Groan To see me weep? Did he once bend his Eyes? Or shed one Tear in Pity to my Love? To which of his Barbarities shall I give The Pref'rence? Now no more the Queen of Gods, Nor Jove beholds these things with equal Eyes. True Faith is no where to be found: Him toss'd On Shore, of all things indigent, I here Receiv'd; and made him Partner of my Throne, (Fool that I was!) repair'd his shatter'd Fleet, And hospitably sav'd his Friends from Death. Furies distract me! Now Apollo's Shrines, Now Lycian Oracles have warn'd him hence: Th'Ambassadour of Heav'n, from mighty Jove Dispatch'd, brings dreadful Mandates thro' the Air. Belike, the Gods are wond'rously concern'd For his Affairs; That Care disturbs their Rest. I nor detain thee, nor refel thy Words. Away for Latium, by the Winds; go, seek Thy Kingdom o'er the Waves: For me, I hope, If the just Gods have Pow'r, thou wilt receive Thy due Reward among the Rocks; and there Call oft on Dido: Wrapt in dusky Flames, I'll follow thee; and, soon as icy Death Has freed my Soul from Flesh, in ev'ry place My Ghost shall haunt thee: Villain, thou shalt feel My Vengeance; I shall hear it, and That Fame Shall reach my Ears among the Shades below. This said, she, in the Middle of her Speech, Breaks off abrupt, and sick'ning flies the Light; With Loathing turns her Eyes from his; and leaves Him wav'ring, and a thousand things to say Irresolute, in Fear: Her Maids support Her Body, as she sinks into their Arms, And lay her fainting on the Royal Bed. But good Æneas, tho' he much desir'd By comforting to ease her Grief, and sooth The Tempest of her Passions; groaning deep, And stagger'd in his Mind by mighty Love: Yet executes the dread Commands of Heav'n, And to his Fleet repairs. Then all at once The Trojans urge their Toil, and from the Dock Draw their tall Ships: The new-pitch'd Gallies float; Unfashion'd Timber from the Woods they bring, And leafy Oars, thro' Eagerness and Haste; Studious of Flight. Them crouding thro' the Streets you might behold, And rushing from the Town. As when the Ants Mindful of Winter, waste a heap of Corn, To store their Granaries. Along the Fields Goes a black Troop; and in a narrow Path Their Booty they convey: With all their Strength Some on their Shoulders push the cumbrous Grains; Others bring up the Rear, and chide Delay: The Path all smokes, and hot the Work proceeds. Then, Dido, what were then thy Thoughts? What Groans, At such a Prospect, heav'd thy throbbing Breast? When from a Turret's Top thou didst behold The Hurry of the Shore, and all the Sea Confus'd with mingled Noises? Cruel Love! To what Extremes does not thy Tyrant Pow'r Urge mortal Breasts? Again dissolv'd in Tears, Spight of her Rage, and Pride, again she tries Suppliant Intreaties, and submissive bows Her haughty Soul to Love: That, e'er she dy'd, No Measures unattempted might be left. My dearest Anna, from all Parts, thou seest, Rushing they croud the Shore; their Sails unfurl'd Invite the Breezes, and with joyful Haste The shouting Mariners have crown'd their Ships. Could I have e'er expected such a Blow Of cruel Fate as This; my Soul could then Have born it: Yet This only Favour grant Thy wretched Sister; for That faithless Man To Thee alone uncommon Rev'rence paid, Trusted his Secrets with Thee; Thou alone Didst know the soft Approaches to his Soul, And all the proper Seasons of Address. Go, Sister; and This Message suppliant bear To the proud Foe. I never did conspire, At Aulis, with the Greeks, to overturn The Trojan State, nor sent a Fleet to Troy; Nor e'er disturb'd his bury'd Father's Dust. Why does he stop his unrelenting Ears To my Intreaties? Whither does he fly So hasty? This last Favour let him grant To his unhappy Lover; let him wait An easy Voyage, and permitting Winds. I now no more petition him to yield The Rights of Nuptials, which he has betray'd; Nor urge him to relinquish his gay Hopes Of Italy, and Empire: All I beg, Is but a soothing Interval, some Rest, And Respite to my Passion; 'till my Fate Shall to Misfortune reconcile my Soul, Subdu'd by Grief, and teach me how to mourn. Pity thy Sister; This last Boon I crave: This let him grant; I'll then dismiss him free, And crown his Satisfaction with my Death. Thus she her Suit express'd; Such mournful Pray'rs Her weeping Sister carries, and repeats: He by no Tears is mov'd; untractable, And deaf to all Intreaties: Fate forbids; And Jove, o'er-ruling, stops his pitying Ears. As when rough Alpine Winds, with struggling Gusts, This way, and that, contend t' o'erturn an Oak Stubborn with aged Timber; Roaring loud The Branches bend; The stiff Trunk bows; The Leaves Thick falling strew the Ground: It self fast clings Fix'd in the Rocks; and high as it uprears It's tow'ring Head in Air, so deep it's Root Shoots downwards to the Centre. With such Force, And ceaseless Noise, the Hero on all sides Is batter'd; and within his manly Breast Confines the Pain he feels: His Mind persists Unmov'd; and Tears roll down his Cheeks in vain. Then, terrify'd with Fate, th'unhappy Queen Implores to die; and sickens to behold The bright Convex of Heav'n. To make her urge Her Enterprize, and leave the hated Light; When pious Gifts she on the Altars laid Smoking with Incense (horrid to relate!) She saw the Liquors sacred to the Gods Turn black; and as the holy Wine was pour'd, It chang'd to putrid Blood. This dire Portent From All, ev'n from her Sister, she conceals. Besides, within her Court a Marble Dome There stood, devoted to her former Lord; Which with uncommon Honour she rever'd, With snowy Fleeces, and fresh Garlands crown'd. Hence Groans are heard, and her dead Husband's Voice Seeming to call aloud; when gloomy Night Obscures the World: And, on her Palace-Top, The lonely Owl with oft-repeated Scream Complains, and spins into a dismal Length Her baleful Shrieks. Nor less the Warnings, giv'n By ancient Augurs, fright her restless Mind With terrible Predictions. In her Dreams Cruel Æneas persecutes her Soul To Madness. Still abandon'd to her self, Cheerless, without a Guide, she seems to go A long, a tédious Journey, and to seek Her Tyrian Subjects on deserted Coasts. So raving Pentheus Troops of Furies sees, Two Suns, and double Thebes: So mad with Guilt Orestes, agitated on the Stage, Flies from his Mother's Ghost, with Torches arm'd, And black infernal Snakes; revengeful Fiends Sit in the Doors, and intercept his Flight. Therefore when all the Furies in her Breast She had conceiv'd, o'ercome with wild Despair, And resolute to die; the Time, and Means She with her self contrives: and Thus accosts Her mourning Sister; (her Design conceals, And smooths her Visage with dissembled Hope.) Rejoice with me, my Sister; I have found A sure Expedient, which will either bring My Lover back, or free me from my Love. Near Ocean's Limits, and the setting Sun, On Æthiopia's Bounds, there is a Place, Where mighty Atlas on his Shoulders turns The rolling Axis studded o'er with Stars. Here a Massylian Priestess lives; who kept The Temple of th'Hesperides, with Food Supply'd the Guardian Dragon, in his Meals Honey infus'd, and drowsy Poppy's Juice, And in the Tree preserv'd the sacred Boughs. She undertakes with Charms to disengage Whome'er she pleases, others to involve In restless Cares; makes rapid Streams stand still, And backwards turns the Stars: From Hell she calls Nocturnal Ghosts; The Ground, you'll see, will groan, Beneath her Feet, and Oaks from Hills descend. Be all the Gods my Witnesses, and Thou, My dearest Sister, with Regret I fly For Aid to Magick Arts. Do thou erect A Pile with secresy in th'inner Court, Beneath the Cope of Heav'n; and on it place The Trojan Arms, which in the Chamber fix'd That Traytor left, his Cloaths, the genial Bed On which I was undone: T'abolish all The Villain's Relicks, is our form'd Design; And such Direction the sage Priestess gives. This said, she silent stood, and o'er her Face A dying Paleness spread: Yet Anna's Thoughts Never suspected that her Sister meant Her Fun'ral, on pretext of sacred Rites; Could not conceive so frantick a Despair, And fear'd no worse than when Sichæus dy'd; Therefore obeys her Orders. But in th'interiour Court, and open Air, A lofty Pile with Pitch-Trees and cleft Oak Is built: The Queen with Garlands hangs it round, And crowns it with a fun'ral Wreath: Above, The Hero's Raiment, and the Sword he left, And his Effigy on the Bed she lays, Not ign'rant of the future. Altars stand Around; And, with her Tresses scatter'd loose, The Priestess thunders o'er three hundred Gods, Erebus, Chaos, three-shap'd Hecate, Virgin Diana's triple Form. The Place With fancy'd Waters of Avernus' Fount She sprinkles. Herbs are brought by Moon-light mow'd With brazen Scythes, big, swol'n with milky Juice Of noxious Poison; and the fleshy Knot Torn from the Forehead of a new-foal'd Colt, To rob the Mother's Love. Her self with one Foot bare, and Robes unbound, Before the Altars, with a season'd Cake, And pious Hands, resolv'd on Death, invokes To witness all the Gods, and ev'ry Star Conscious of Fate, and whate'er Pow'r regards And vindicates the Cause of injur'd Love. 'Twas Night; and weary Mortals o'er the World, Lay with sweet Sleep refresh'd: The ruffled Woods, And roaring Seas no more are heard; The Stars Roll sliding in the Middle of their Course. The Fields all hush'd; The Beasts, and painted Birds, Which haunt the liquid Ponds, and thorny Brakes, In silent Night, reliev'd with soft Repose, Forget their Cares, and lose the Toils of Day. Not so the wretched Dido; No sweet Sleep Lulls her a moment; In her Eyes, or Soul, Not for a moment she receives the Night: Her Pangs redouble; Love with boiling Foam Rages afresh, and with a various Tide Of warring Passions fluctuates in her Breast. Such Thoughts as These she with her self revolves. What shall I do? Derided shall I try Again my former Lovers? And with Pray'rs Suppliant sollicite the Numidian Lords, Whose proffer'd Vows so oft I have disdain'd? Or shall I go, attend the Trojan Fleet, And be obedient to their worst Commands? Because I have assisted them, and find My Favours with such Gratitude repay'd? Or grant I would; Who of That haughty Crew Would suffer me, or in their stately Ships Receive me scorn'd? Not yet, alas! convinc'd, Poor, undone Wretch, not yet dost thou perceive Perjur'd Laomedon's perfidious Race? What? shall I then accompany, alone, The shouting Mariners? Or round inclos'd With all my Tyrians? Those whom scarce I drew From Sidon, shall I drag to Sea again, And bid them spread their Canvass to the Winds? No; Die, as thou deserv'st: and with the Steel Cure all thy Pains. Thou, Sister, by my Tears O'ercome, to sooth my frantick Love, didst first Expose me to the Foe; and load my Soul With all This Anguish. Could I not have liv'd Free, like the Savages, without a Crime, Free from the Nuptial Bed? and ne'er have known Such Plagues as These are? Broken is the Faith I vow'd to dead Sichæus. Such Complaints She burst, with Sobbing, from her tortur'd Breast. Æneas, in his lofty Ship, resolv'd Upon his Voyage, and prepar'd to sail, Securely slept. To Him the Form Divine Returning, just the same in Mien, and Look, Appear'd in Dream, and Thus again advis'd: Resembling Mercury in ev'ry Part, His Voice, Complexion, and his yellow Hair, And well-proportion'd beauteous Limbs of Youth. Canst thou in This Conjuncture, Goddess-born, Indulge thy Sleep? Nor think what Dangers round Inclose thee, thoughtless Man? Nor dost thou hear The Zephyrs breathe propitious on the Main? She, resolute on Death, revolves her Plots, And Mischiefs dire; and with a various Tide Of warring Passions fluctuates in her Breast. Will you not fly with eager Haste, while yet 'Tis in your Pow'r to fly? You strait will see With Ships the Ocean crouded, hostile Brands Glare on the Billows; and the Shore in Flames, In Hurry, and Confusion; if the Morn O'ertake you lingring on the Tyrian Coasts. Rise, break Delay: A Woman is a Thing Still various, and uncertain. Thus he spoke, And mingled with the dusky Shades of Night. Æneas, at the sudden Vision struck With Horrour and Surprize, springs from the Bed, And rouses up his Mates: Wake, wake, my Friends, Sit to your Oars, with haste unfurl your Sails. The God again has urg'd us, sent from Heav'n, To speed our Flight, and cut the twisted Cords. Thee, Holy Pow'r, whoe'er Thou art, with Joy We follow; and again thy dread Commands Obey: Be Thou assistant at our Need, And guide the Stars propitious in the Sky. He said; and from the Scabbard swiftly draws His flashing Sword, and with the Steel unsheath'd Divides the Cables: With like Ardour fir'd All haste; They rush, they leave the Land; With Ships The Sea is cover'd o'er: With all their Strength They dash the Foam, and sweep the briny Waves. Aurora, from Tithonus' saffron Bed Now rising, sprinkled-o'er the World with Light; Soon as the Queen perceiv'd the dawning Day, And from a Tow'r beheld the Navy move With even Sails, the empty Ports, and Shores Abandon'd: With repeated Blows she beats Her beauteous Breast, and rends her yellow Hair: Shall he then go? The Fugitive? O Jove! She cry'd, and make my Kingdoms thus his Sport? Will they not rush to Arms? From all the Town Pursue? While others from the Docks swift plunge My Ships into the Sea? Go, fly; bring Fire; Quick, hoise your Sails, and strongly ply your Oars. What was't I said? Where am I? What Distraction Has turn'd my Brain? Unhappy Dido! Now Thy cruel Fate stabs home. Then was the Time To act, when you resign'd your Sceptre. This, This is his Faith, and Honour, who, they say, Carries about his wand'ring Country-Gods, Where'er he goes; and on his Shoulders bore His aged Father. Could I not have torn His mangled Limbs? and strew'd them on the Sea? Have murder'd his Associates? stabb'd his Son? And serv'd him up at Table to the Sire? But grant that doubtful is th'Event of War; Whom should I fear, when I resolv'd to die? I should have scatter'd Firebrands thro' his Fleet, His Hatches fill'd with Flames, extirpated The Son, the Father, all the cursed Race; And fall'n my self upon the slaughter'd Heaps. Thou Sun, who in thy fiery Course survey'st The Works of Men; Thou Juno, of These Cares Conscious Interpreter; Thou Hecate, Whose Name is howl'd at Midnight thro' the Streets; You, Ye avenging Furies, and Ye Gods Of dying, lost Elisa: To my Words Attend; inflict on Crimes the Vengeance due, And hear my Pray'rs. If Fate's unmov'd Decree, And mighty Jove's resistless Will, ordain That This perfidious Traitor must arrive Safe in the Port, and reach the destin'd Land; Yet, plagu'd with War by a bold Nation rais'd, Banish'd his Coasts, and ravish'd from th'Embrace Of lov'd Iülus, let him beg for Aid, And see the barb'rous Murder of his Friends: At last, on hard Conditions forc'd to sue For Peace, his Kingdom let him ne'er enjoy, Nor wish'd-for Light; but fall before his Time, And lie unbury'd on the common Sand. This I implore; and with my Blood pour forth This dying Pray'r. Then you, my Tyrians, vex With Hate immortal all their future Race; And pay That grateful Off'ring to my Ghost: Between These Nations let no League, or Truce Be made: Thou, some Avenger, from my Dust Arise, to prosecute with Fire and Sword The Trojan Exiles; Now, in after times, Whenever Strength sufficient shall be giv'n; Let Shores to Shores be adverse, Seas to Seas, And Arms to Arms: Let late Posterity With stern Defiance wage eternal War. She said; And ev'ry way her wav'ring Thoughts Divided, and contriv'd with swift Dispatch To break off Light detested. Then in brief Barce, Sichæus' Nurse, she Thus bespeaks; (For in the Grave her own was laid at Tyre:) Dear Nurse, my Sister Anna hither send; Bid her with Water from the living Stream Her Body sprinkle o'er, and with her bring The Victims, and the Sacrifice ordain'd For Expiation: And do you your self Your Temples with a holy Fillet bind; I mean to finish the Religious Rites To Pluto, which already I've prepar'd, To end my Cares, and fire the Trojan Pile. She said; The other, with th'officious haste Of Age, her Orders studiously obeys. But at her dire Design the desp'rate Queen Trembling, and rolling round her sanguine Eyes, (Her quiv'ring Cheeks with intermingled Spots All fleck'd, and pale at near-approaching Death) With frantick pace into the inner Court Rushes, and furious eagerly ascends The lofty Pile, unsheaths the Trojan Sword, A Present not design'd for such a Use. There, when the Trojan Robes, and conscious Bed She saw; she paus'd a-while in Thought, and gave A space to Tears: Her Body then she flings Upon the Bed, and speaks her dying Words. Ye dear Remains, while Heav'n and Fate were kind; Receive This Soul, and free me from These Cares. I've liv'd, and finish'd the allotted Course Which Fortune gave me: Now my Royal Ghost Must go enlarg'd down to the nether World. I've built a stately City, seen my Walls, Punish'd my barb'rous Brother, and reveng'd My murder'd Husband. Happy had I been, Ah! more than happy; had the Trojan Fleet Ne'er touch'd my Coasts. Thus having spoke, she press'd Her Face upon the Bed: And shall I then Die unreveng'd? Yes; Thus to die, ev'n Thus, Is better than to live. May from the Sea The cruel Trojan view This fun'ral Blaze, And with him bear the Omens of my Death. Thus while she spoke; th'Attendants saw her fall, The Sword all frothing, and her Hands besmear'd With Blood: Loud Cries ascend the vaulted Roof; Fame thro' th'astonish'd City wildly flies; With shrill Laments, with Groans, and female Shrieks The Houses ring; And Tumult rends the Sky. As if all Carthage, by th'invading Foe, Or ancient Tyre were fall'n; and raging Flames O'er Tops of Houses, and of Temples roll'd. Half dead, amaz'd, and trembling with Affright, Her Sister heard; she tears her Visage, beats Her Breast, and rushing thro' the midst calls loud Upon the dying Queen. Was it for This, My Sister? Did you then with study'd Fraud Deceive me? And for This did I prepare The Pile? These Altars? and the holy Fires? What shall I first complain of, thus forlorn? Did you disdain to let your Sister die, And share Fate with you? Me you should have call'd To the same Death; We should have perish'd Both In the same Hour, and by the same Despair. I too This Pile erected; and invok'd Our Country-Gods: Ah! wherefore? That I might Be absent, Cruel! at your Hour of Death? Me, Sister, and Your self you have destroy'd; Your City, our Sidonian Lords; and all The State. Bring Water from the limpid Stream; I'll bathe her Wounds, and catch her straggling Breath; If any yet hang hov'ring o'er her Lips. So saying, she ascends the lofty Pile; And her expiring Sister in her Arms Embraces, sighing deep; and with her Robe Dries up the clotted Gore. She strives with pain To lift her heavy Lids, and fainting sinks; The Wound infix'd sounds deep beneath her Breast. Thrice, leaning on her Arm, she feebly rais'd Her Body; Thrice roll'd back upon the Bed: With swimming Eyes seeks the last Light of Heav'n, And groans to find it. Then the Wife of Jove, Pitying her tedious Pangs, and struggling Death, Sends Iris from above, to disengage Her agonizing Soul. For since she fell Neither by Fate, nor by a Death deserv'd; But dy'd unfortunate before her Time, Transported by a sudden Passion's rage: As yet Proserpina her yellow Hair Had not shorn off; nor to the Stygian Shades Consign'd her. Iris then, with saffron Wings, Dewy, and drawing from th'opposing Sun A thousand various Colours in the Sky, Alighted swift; and hov'ring o'er her Head, This Lock to Pluto sacred, by Command, I bear; and from This Body set thee free. She said; and with her Right hand cut the Lock; At once the vital Heat is all extinct, And Life dissolving fleets into the Winds. The End of the Fourth Book. BOOK the Fifth. Meanwhile Æneas gain'd the middle Sea, Bent on his Voyage; and before the Wind Plough'd the dark Waves; back looking on the Walls, Which now with hapless Dido's fun'ral Blaze Shone red: What Cause had lighted such a Flame, Was secret; But the Knowledge of Despair Implacable, from violated Love, And what a frantick Woman's Rage could do, To sad Presage incline the Trojans' Breasts. Now on the full extended Main, the Land No more appear'd; but All was Sea, and Sky: A dusky Cloud hung gather'd o'er his Head, Bringing on Night, and Storm; Upon the Waves Lay horrid Darkness: From the lofty Deck The Pilot's self, ev'n Palinurus, cries, What Clouds, alas! invelop all the Heav'ns? Or what, great Neptune, does thy Will intend? This said, he gives Command to furl their Sails, And strongly ply their Oars: Then turns oblique His Canvass to the Wind, and Thus proceeds. Magnanimous Æneas, should ev'n Jove By promising assure my Voyage safe; I could not in This Weather hope to reach The Coasts of Italy: The Winds transverse Roar chang'd, and from the low'ring West arise; And all the Air is thicken'd to a Cloud. Nor have we Strength to bear against the Stress Of Sea, and Sky: Since Fortune all o'erpow'rs; Her let us follow, and where-e'er she calls, Direct our Course. Nor is the Distance great, As I conceive, to Eryx' faithful Shores, Fraternal Coasts, and to Sicanian Ports; If I rememb'ring rightly trace the Stars. Then good Æneas; So indeed I long Observ'd the Winds require, and you in vain Oppose them: Turn your Sails: Is there a Land To me more acceptable, and on which I sooner would desire our Ships should rest; Than That, in which reserv'd for me survives Trojan Acestes? And whose Bosom holds My Sire Anchises' Bones? This said, they steer Strait to the Port: Th'auspicious Zephyrs swell Their Sails; The Fleet bounds swiftly o'er the Deep; And joyous on the well-known Shore at length They land. Them distant on a Mountain's height, Admiring their Arrival, and the Ships Of his lov'd Countrymen, Acestes meets, With Jav'lins arm'd, and horrid in the Hide Of a rough Libyan Bear. He to the River Crimisus, of a Trojan Mother born, And not unmindful of his ancient Race, With Gratulation welcomes their Return, His rustick Entertainment joyful gives, And with his friendly Aid relieves their Toils. Soon as the Morn, fresh smiling from the East, Had put the Stars to flight; from all the Shore Æneas summons his assembled Friends, And Thus bespeaks them from a rising Ground. Ye gen'rous Trojans, sprung from Blood Divine; One yearly Circle is by rolling Months Complete, since in the Grave we laid to rest The Mortal Relicks of my Godlike Sire; And consecrated Fun'ral-Altars rais'd. And now That Day, if I remember right, Is come, by me (so You, ye Gods, decreed) For ever honour'd, and for ever mourn'd. This Day did I on Libya's barren Sands In Exile live, or on the Grecian Sea Detain'd, or in Mycenæ; annual Vows Ev'n Then I would perform, and solemn Pomps; And on his Altars pile th'Oblations due. Now to my Father's self, his Bones, and Dust (Not without Providence, and Heav'n's Design, As I suppose,) we come, and enter safe These friendly Ports. Come on then; let us all Honour This Festival with Joy, implore From Him propitious Winds, and Leave to pay These annual Oblations, when our Walls Are built, and Temples sacred to Him stand. Two Heads of Kine Acestes sprung from Troy Gives you for ev'ry Ship; Invite the Gods, Your Own, and His, to celebrate the Feast. Besides; If on the Ninth returning Morn The Day shall smile serene, and with it's Beams Brighten the World; I will appoint a Prize First to our Naval Trojan Crew; Our Ships Shall try their Swiftness: Next whoe'er excels In Running; or, confiding in his Strength, Lances the Jav'lin, or the feather'd Shaft; Or with the rigid Gauntlet dares the Fight; Let all be present, and expect Rewards Adjudg'd to Victors: With your Voices all Assenting join, and bind your Heads with Boughs. He said; and with his Mother's Myrtle-wreath His Temples crowns: The same does Elymus, And old Acestes; young Ascanius next; Then all the Youth. Directly to the Tomb He from th'Assembly goes, by Thousands round Attended: For Libation here he pours Two Bowls of Wine unmix'd upon the Ground, Two of warm Milk, and two of holy Blood; Then scatters purple Flow'rs, and Thus he speaks. Hail sacred Sire! Again, ye Ashes, hail, In vain revisited! And Thou, the Ghost Of Him who gave me Birth! The Gods deny'd To Us, with Thee, to gain th'Italian Shore, Ausonian Tyber, and the fatal Fields. He said; And from the Bottom of the Shrine A skipp'ry Serpent, vast, sev'n Volumes roll'd, Sev'n Spires; he gently twines around the Tomb, And o'er the Altar glides: Cerulean Streaks, And burnish'd Spots, distinct with Drops of Gold, Brighten'd his Back, and glitt'ring Scales: As when From th'adverse Sun the show'ry Bow reflects A thousand various Colours in the Clouds. Æneas wonders at the Sight: The Snake, Drawing in length his sinuous, tardy Train, Among the Jars, and polish'd Goblets slides, And softly licks the Feast; then harmless creeps Back to the Bottom of the Tomb, and leaves The tasted Altars. He the more renews The destin'd Honours to his Father's Shade; Uncertain, whether to their Sight appear'd The Genius of the Place, or of his Sire. Five Sheep, obsequious to th'accustom'd Rite, He sacrifices; next, as many Sows, And Heifers black; then pours the Wine from Bowls, Invoking great Anchises' Soul, dismiss'd From Acheron. Nor less his Friends, as Each With Store was furnish'd, offer Gifts, and load The Altars, sacrificing Oxen slain: Others in order Cauldrons fix; and, stretch'd Along the Grass, o'er Heaps of burning Coals Place Spits, and fry the Entrails on the Fire. Th'expected Day was come; And Phœbus' Steeds Brought the ninth Morning with unclouded Light: Loud Rumour, and the great Acetes' Name Excite the neighb'ring States; With shouting Crouds They fill the Shore; to see the Trojans, All, And Some to try their Fortune in the Games. First in the Centre of the Cirque are plac'd The Prizes; sacred Tripods, Wreaths of Greens, And Palms for Victors; Arms, and purple Robes, Talents of massy Silver, and of Gold: And from the Middle of the high-rais'd Earth The Trumpet's Sound proclaims the Sports begun. First four selected Ships, from all the Fleet, Equal, begin the Strife with pond'rous Oars. His swiftly-sailing Pristis Mnestheus plies With sturdy Rowers; Mnestheus, after made Italian, Author of the Memmian Line: And Gyas in the huge Chimæra rides, A City's Work; Her with a triple Tire The Trojan Youth impel; Three Banks of Oars Ascend: Sergestus, whom the Sergian House It's Founder boasts, in the vast Centaur sails: And Scylla of cerulean Colour bears Cloanthus, first of the Cluentian Race. There stood a Rock at distance in the Main, Against the foaming Shore; at certain times O'erwhelm'd and beaten by the swelling Waves, When North-East Winds tempestuous hide the Stars: In Calms it quiet rests; and in the Sea Unmov'd, a Field appears, a Station fit For Cormorants, when pruning in the Sun. Here Prince Æneas from a leafy Oak, To guide the Sailors, plants a verdant Goal; From whence they should return, and round direct In long Circumference their winding Course. Then All by Lot their places take; and first The Chiefs in Gold, and Crimson, stand, from far Effulgent on the Decks: The other Youth With poplar Wreaths are shaded; Smear'd with Oil Their naked Shoulders shine: Upon their Seats With strong-brac'd Arms intent they grasp their Oars, Intent expect the Signal: Throbbing Fear Beats in their Breasts, and anxious Love of Praise. Soon as the Trumpet loudly sounds, at once All from their Barriers spring; The Shouts confus'd Of Sailors rend the Vault of Heav'n; The Sea Turn'd upward froths beneath their dashing Arms: At once they plough the Brine; and all the Deep Yawns wide, convuls'd with Oars, and trident Beaks. With Force less rapid, starting from their Bounds, The Chariots whirl, and smoke along the Field; Less earnestly the eager Charioteers O'er their swift Horses shake the waving Reins, Hang prone upon the Lash, and bending fly. Then with the Party-favour of the Croud, With Shouts, and mix'd Applauses, all the Grove Resounds; The Shores included roll the Noise; And from the echoing Hills the Voice returns. Amidst the Throng, and Hurry on the Waves, Before the rest, first Gyas scuds away: Him next Cloanthus follows, with his Oars More happy; but his Vessel by it's Weight Detains him tardy: After These, with Sails Equal, the Pristis, and the Centaur strive To run the foremost; Now the Pristis gains, Now the huge Centaur wins on Her; Now Both Together with united Fronts are born: And the long Gallies plough the briny Deep. They now approach'd the Rock, and reach'd the Goal; When Gyas first, and Victor, in mid Sea Calls to Menætes, Pilot of his Ship; Whither so far decline you to the Right? Hither direct your Steerage, love the Shore, And let our Rowers raze the left-hand Rocks; Leave Others to the Deep. He said; But old Menætes, fearing hidden Shelves, detorts His Rudder to the Ocean: Why so far Diverse, Menætes? Nearer to the Shore, Gyas again calls out aloud; and sees Cloanthus close, and pressing on his Stern: He, betwixt Gyas, and the sounding Rocks, Interiour, skims the left-hand way, and swift Outstrips his Rival, and beyond the Goal Smooth shoots along, and gains the safer Seas. The Youth, with Rage and Disappointment fir'd, (Tears running down his Cheeks) his Dignity Forgetting, and the Safety of his Friends, Push'd slow Menætes from the high-built Deck Precipitate into the Sea; Himself As Pilot takes his Place, exhorting loud His Crew, and turns the Rudder to the Shore. But old Menætes, from the Bottom deep At length emerging, heavy in his wet, And brine-drench'd Garments, crawling, climb'd the Top Of the tall Rock, and sate upon the Dry. The Trojans laugh'd, to see him fall, and swim; And from his Breast disgorge the brackish Waves. This unexpected Change with eager Hope Fires Mnestheus, and Sergestus, lagging last, To vanquish Gyas thus retarded. First Sergestus takes his place, and to the Rock Approaches; yet not all his Vessel first, Part first, the Rival Pristis presses part Close with her Beak. Then Mnestheus, thro' the Crew Walking along the Middle of his Deck, Excites his Mates: Now, now, Hectorean Band, Rise to your Oars; You, whom from ruin'd Troy I chose Associates: now That Strength exert, That Spirit which you shew'd on Libyan Sands, Th'Iönian Sea, and Malea's tumbling Waves. Mnestheus now strives not to be crown'd the first; Yet Oh!—But let Those conquer, whom thy Pow'r, Great Neptune, favours: Let us yet disdain To be the last; So far o'ercome, my Friends, And That Disgrace forbid. With utmost Force They tug their Oars; With vast repeated Strokes The beaky Vessel trembles; And the Sea Flies back: The panting Labour shakes their Limbs, And clammy Mouths; Sweat flows in Rivers round. Fortune to These the wish'd for Honour gave: For while Sergestus, furious in the Strife, And heedless, urg'd his Foredeck to the Shelves, Interiour, and within a narrow Space Of Sea confin'd; amidst the jutting Rocks He stuck, unfortunate: The Rocks rebound; Among their craggy Points the stubborn Oars Stand cracking, bent; The Foredeck shatter'd hangs: The Crew of Sailors rise, and clamour loud, Detain'd, embarass'd; Iron Spikes, and Poles Of sharpen'd Oak they ply; and on the Gulf, Industrious, gather up the broken Oars. But Mnestheus joyful, and with That Success Itself more vig'rous, with his rowing Croud, And all the Winds invited to his Sails, Gains the prone Deep, and swiftly shoots away Upon the open Ocean. As a Dove, Which in some hollow Pumice feeds her Young, Rous'd on a sudden from her Covert, flies Into the Fields; and, scar'd, with flutt'ring Noise Against the Roof her sounding Pinions beats: Then, smoothly gliding thro' the quiet Air, Skims the thin Way, nor moves her nimble Wings. So Mnestheus, so the Pristis' self divides Th'extremest Ocean; so the Force impress'd Itself impels her flight: And first she leaves Sergestus struggling with the lofty Rock, Pent up among the narrow Shelves, in vain Calling for Help, and learning how to run With broken Oars. Then Gyas, and the huge Chimæra's Bulk he follows; She, because She lost her Pilot, yields. Cloanthus now Alone remains, just ent'ring in the Port; Him he pursues, and with his utmost Strength Close urges: Now the Noise redoubles; All With Shouts encourage him; The Sky resounds With deaf'ning Clamour. These disdain to lose Th'Advantage they have gain'd, and burn to stake Their Lives for Glory: Those Success inspires; They can, because 'tis thought they can: And Both Perhaps had born the Prize with equal Keels; Had not Cloanthus, stretching to the Sea His Hands, Thus vow'd, and Thus invok'd the Gods. Ye Gods, who rule the Ocean which I sail; Victor before your Altars, on This Shore, To you a snow-white Bull I will present, Oblig'd by Vow; and on the briny Deep Scatter the Entrails, pouring purest Wine. He said; And him beneath the lowest Waves The whole Assembly of the Nereids heard, And Phorcus, and the Virgin Panopea; And old Portunus with his ample Palm Himself push'd on the Vessel: She more swift Than Wind, or feather'd Arrow, flies to Land, Within the Harbour's deep Recess secure. Æneas then, observant of the Form By Custom fix'd, together calls the whole Assembly; by the Herald's Voice aloud Declares Cloanthus Victor; and his Brow With verdant Laurel crowns. On ev'ry Ship Three Heifers, to be chosen, he bestows, A silver Talent's massy Weight, and Wine, As Prizes. To the Conqu'ror first he gives A Cloak, with Gold embroider'd, edg'd with Fringe Of Melibœan Purple, doubly round Entwining: And on Ida's leafy Top The Royal Boy, inwoven, with his Darts Urges in Chase the flying Deer, intent, And panting in the Colours; Him the Bird Of Jove, descending swiftly from the Sky, Born on his hooky Talons snatch'd aloft: The aged Keepers stretch their Hands to Heav'n In vain; And angry Dogs bark high in Air. To Him whose Merit held the Second place A Coat of Mail he gives, compact with Hooks, And wrought with triple Tissue, to defend At once, and deck the Warriour; Which himself Victor near rapid Simois, and the Walls Of lofty Troy, had from Demoleus torn: Two Servants, Sagaris, and Phlegeas, scarce Could with joint Strength upon their Shoulders bear The various Vestment; Yet in This long since Demoleus clad, the straggling Trojans drove. Two Brazen Cauldrons to the Third he gives, And Silver Bowls with Figures rough emboss'd. And now rewarded All, and proud with Wealth, They walk'd in pomp, with purple Fillets bound About their Heads: When with much Art, and Pain, Torn from the cruel Rock, his Oars half lost, And one Side maim'd, Sergestus tugg'd along His slow dishonour'd Skiff. As when a Snake Is catch'd (as oft it happens) on a Ridge Of rising Ground; whose Body cross'd aslant A brazen Wheel has mangled on the Road; Or some sour Passenger with heavy Blow Has left half dead, and shatter'd with a Stone: He flying twists his Length in tortuous Wreaths, Part fierce with ardent Eyes, and hissing Tongue, Uprears aloft his swelling Neck in Air; Part damag'd by the Wound, retards him crush'd, Wriggling his Spires, and knitting Knots in vain. With such a Kind of Steerage, mov'd along The sluggish Gally; Yet she makes her Sails, And enters with full Gale the Harbour's Mouth. Æneas, joyful for his Friends and Ship Return'd in Safety, to Sergestus gives The Prize allotted, Pholoë, a Slave Of Crete, not ignorant of Pallas' Art, And her two infant Sons beneath her Breasts. This Sport thus ended; good Æneas goes Into a grassy Plain, begirt around With Woods on winding Hills: Amidst a Vale A Theatre's wide Cirque was form'd; to which The Hero with a Croud of Thousands went, And in the Middle of th'Assembly sate. Here Those who in the rapid Race would strive With Prizes he invites: From ev'ry Part The mingled Trojans, and Sicilians come; First Nisus, and Euryalus: Euryalus, by beauteous blooming Youth Distinguish'd; Nisus, by the pious Love He bore the Stripling: Next to These appears Diores, born of Priam's Royal Blood; Salius, and Paran next, Acarnian That, And This Arcadian, sprung from Tegea's Race: Then two Trinacrian Youths; This, Elymus, That, Panopes, in Wood-land Countries bred; Who Followers of old Acestes came: With many more, whom Fame obscure conceals. Them Thus Æneas in the Midst bespeaks. Mark well my Words, and pleas'd Attention lend: Not One of all This Number shall from me Go unrewarded; I'll on each bestow Two Gnossian Jav'lins, bright with polish'd Steel, And a carv'd Battle-axe, with Silver wrought. This Honour shall be One to All; the Three Who first excel, shall diff'rent Prizes share, And with pale Olive bind their Heads: The First A Steed enrich'd with Trappings shall receive; The Next an Amazonian Quiver, fill'd With Thracian Arrows, which a Belt around Incloses with broad Gold, a Buckle clasps With round smooth Diamond: Be the Third content With This Argolick Shield. He said; They take Their Stations: And, the Signal giv'n, at once, Fleet as a Tempest, out they spring, and leave The Bounds, fly o'er the Field, and mark the Goal. Nisus the First, and long before the rest, Swift shoots away; more swift than Winds, or Wings Of Light'ning. Next, but far at distance next, Him Salius follows: Near to Him, the Third Euryalus: Him Elymus succeeds: Whom pressing close, Diores flies; and justles Heel with Heel, Imminent o'er his Shoulder; and had Room More wide been giv'n him, foremost he had sprung, Or left him doubtful. Now they panting reach'd The utmost Line, and almost touch'd the Goal: When Nisus, sliding on the slipp'ry Gore, Which there by chance, from Oxen slain, besmear'd The Ground, and verdant Grass, his tott'ring Steps Could not support; but now, ev'n Victor, fell, Prone in the Mire obscene, and sacred Blood, Unfortunate: Yet not unmindful Then Of Friendship, and Euryalus, oppos'd Himself to Salius, from the slipp'ry place Rising: He, tumbling on the clotted Sand, Extended lay; Euryalus springs on, And, Victor by th'Assistance of his Friend, Comes in the First, with Shouts, and mix'd Applause. To Him the Next comes Elymus; and now Diores Third. Here Salius loud with Noise Fills the vast Cirque; and to the aged Lords Appealing, claims the Honour which he lost By Treachery: Th'Affections of the Court Favour Euryalus, his graceful Tears, And Virtue heighten'd by his beauteous Form. Diores loudly aids That Plea, who came In vain entitled to the Last Reward, If Salius gains the First. Then Thus the Prince; Unchang'd, my Youths, your Prizes all remain; Nor is the Order of your Palms displac'd: Only permit me to commiserate Th'unhappy Fortune of my guiltless Friend. This said; a huge Getulian Lion's Hide He gives to Salius, rough with heavy Furr, And golden Claws. Here Nisus; If so great Your Pity for the Fall'n; And such Rewards Attend the Vanquish'd: What due Prize remains For Nisus? who deserv'd the choicest Palm; Had he not met the same unlucky Chance, Which Salius shar'd: Then, pointing, shew'd his Face, And Limbs, all smear'd with gory Dirt. On Him The Prince smiles graceful; and commands to bring A Shield, the Work of Didymaon's Art, Torn by the Grecians from the sacred Posts Of Neptune; and with That excelling Gift Distinguishes the well-deserving Youth. The Race thus ended, and the Honours paid; Now whosoe'er has Courage, and a Mind Present within his Breast, let Him approach; With Gauntlets bind his Hands, and raise his Arms. He said; And for the Combate two Rewards Propos'd; the Victor's Prize, a Bull adorn'd With Gold, and Wreaths; a Sword, and burnish'd Helm, The Solace of the Vanquish'd. No Delay Was interpos'd: Forthwith uprises stern, Dares; and, with the Murmur of the Croud, Rears his rough Visage, and prodigious Strength: He who alone with Paris durst contend, And at great Hector's Tomb struck down to Earth Butes renown'd for Conquests, and of Bulk Unwieldy, boasting his Bebrycian Race In long Descent from Amycus deriv'd; And stretch'd him dead upon the yellow Sand. Such Dares was; and such he first uprears His lofty Head, provoking to the Strife, Shews his broad Shoulders, his alternate Arms Protends, and in mock Duel beats the Air. For him a Match is sought; nor dares ev'n One From all That vast Assembly to approach The Challenger, or arm his Hands for Fight. He vaunting then, and thinking all declin'd The Contest, stands before Æneas' Feet; No more demurs, but with his Left hand holds The Bullock's Horn, and Thus proceeds. If None Durst try the Combate; where will be the end Of waiting thus? How long must I delay? Command me, Goddess-born, to take the Prize. A gen'ral Murmur thro' th'Assembly ran; And all the Trojans with one Voice concur, To aid their Champion's Claim. Acestes here Thus chides Entellus with reproaching Words, As next upon the grassy Bank he sate: Entellus, bravest Hero once in vain; Will you so patient suffer such a Prize Without Contention to be born away? Where is our Eryx, vainly boasted God, Your Master? Where your Fame thro' all This Isle Renown'd? and Trophies hanging round your Roof? To whom Entellus; 'Tis not that the Love Of Praise and Glory has my Breast thro' Fear Abandon'd: But my Blood by freezing Age Is cold, retarded; and my Strength benumb'd Within my sapless Trunk: Did now That Youth Which once I had, and which yon Varlet proud So confidently boasts, did That remain; I had not hither come, induc'd by Hope Of This Reward, This comely-shapen Bull; Nor value I the Prize. This said, he flings Into the Midst two Gauntlets huge, of weight Enormous; Those which warlike Eryx wore In Fight, and whose stiff Leather brac'd his Arms. Amaz'd were All; so vast the sev'n tough Hides Of Bulls, with Lead and Iron sewn within: But more than all the rest, the Champion's self Dares, aghast, and at a distance stands, Refusing; And th'illustrious Trojan Chief This way, and That, turns round the pond'rous Folds Immense: Him Thus the aged Sire bespeaks. What had been said, had Any here beheld The Arms, and Gauntlets, brandish'd heretofore By Hercules himself? and That dire Fight, Here, on This Ground? These very Weapons once Your Brother Eryx wore; You see them still Besmear'd with Gore, and spatter'd Brains; With These He stood against the great Alcides: These I us'd, while better Blood supply'd me Strength, Nor envious Age as yet had interspers'd My Temples: But if Trojan Dares thinks These Arms unequal, and his pious Prince, And King Acestes have the same decreed; Let us have due Proportion in the Strife: Dares, dismiss thy Terrour; I remit Great Eryx' Weapons; And do Thou, thy self, Put off thy Trojan Gauntlets. Thus he spoke; And from his Shoulders flings his double Vest, Strips his huge Limbs, huge Bones, and brawny Arms; And in the Midst with mighty Stature stands. Then Prince Æneas equal Gauntlets brings, And binds the Wrists of Both with equal Weight. Forthwith, erect, and high upon their Toes, Both stand, and fearless raise their Arms in Air; Lean back their lofty Heads, to shun the Stroke, Mix Hands with Hands, and irritate the Fight. The one excelling in his nimble Feet, And confident in Youth; The other strong In Limbs, and Bulk; but slow with trembling Knees He staggers; and the panting Labour shakes His huge-built Trunk. In vain repeated Wounds They aim alternate; On their hollow Flanks The Strokes redoubled ring; Their throbbing Breasts Are batter'd with loud Noise; The bandy'd Blows Err round their Ears, and Temples; And beneath The rigid Lead their cracking Jaws resound. Firm by his Weight in one fix'd Posture stands Entellus; with his Body, and quick Eyes Alone, eluding his Assailant's Strokes. He, like a Warriour, who a lofty Town Assaults by Storm; or under Arms besets A Castle on a Hill, now These, now Those Approaches tries, the Place all round with Art Exploring; and with various Efforts vain Urges his Foe. Entellus shews his Arm Rais'd high; The other swift foresees the Blow Descending from his Head, and nimbly slips Aside: Entellus on the empty Air Loses his Strength, and heavy to the Ground Falls with vast Weight; As falls an hollow Pine, Torn from the Roots, on Erymanthus' Top, Or lofty Ida. Eagerly intent The Trojans, and Trinacrian Youth arise; Heav'n rings with Shouts; And first Acestes ran, And from the Ground, commiserating, rais'd His Friend of equal Age. But, not dismay'd, Nor by his Fall retarded, to the Fight The Hero with redoubled Force returns; Rouses his Strength with Rage; Shame fires his Soul, And conscious Worth: O'er all the Field he drives Dares precipitate; now with the right, Now with the left, reit'rating his Blows; Nor Pause, nor Respite: Thick as Hail in Storms Rattles on Roofs, with such repeated Strokes, This way, and That, the Hero with both Hands Buffets his Foe; and turns, and whirls him round. Then Prince Æneas could no farther bear Such Fury to proceed, nor see the Rage Of fierce Entellus: But decides the Fight, And rescues fainting Dares; with These Words Consoling him: Unhappy! has so great A Frenzy seiz'd thee? Dost thou not perceive A Force unequal, and thy Fortune chang'd? Yield to a God. He said; and with his Voice Ended the Combate. Him, with tott'ring Pace Trailing his Legs along, on either side Swagging his Head, and belching from his Throat Thick Clots of Gore, and Teeth commix'd with Blood; His Mates, officious to their vanquish'd Friend, Lead to the Ships: They take the Helm, and Sword; And to Entellus leave the Bull, and Palm. The Victor here exulting in his Prize, And proud of Conquest; See, O Goddess-born, And You, ye Trojans, know from hence, what Strength My Body in it's youthful Days could boast, And from what Death This Dares you preserv'd. Thus having spoke, against the Bull's stern Front, The Conqu'ror's Prize, full opposite he stood; And just between his Horns, with Arm swung back, And rising to the Blow, he pois'd direct The massy Gauntlet; and between the Bones Deep dash'd it in his Brains: Down falls the Beast, Dead, trembling, to the Ground. Then o'er him Thus The Champion speaks: In lieu of Dares' Death, Eryx, to thee This better Life I pay; Here Victor I resign my Art, and Arms. Forthwith Æneas to the Sports invites All who with feather'd Shafts would try their Skill, And names the Prizes. With his ample Hand He from Serestus' Ship a Mast erects, And on it by a Rope suspended ties A swift-wing'd Dove; at which they all should aim Their Arrows: They assemble; and the Lots Shuffled into a brazen Casque are thrown. With fav'ring Shouts Hippocoon First appears, Offspring of Hyrtacus: Then Mnestheus Next, So lately Victor in the Naval Strife, And crown'd with Olive-Greens: Eurytion Third, Brother to Thee, O Pandarus renown'd, Who once, commanded to dissolve the League, Didst first among the Grecians hurl a Dart: Acestes to the Helmet's bottom sinks, The Last; himself presuming to attempt The Sports of Youth. Then All with manly Strength Bend their tough Eugh; each with his utmost Force; All from their Quivers draw their Shafts: And first Shot from the twanging Nerve Hippocoon's flies Along the Sky, divides the liquid Air, And on the Body of the Mast adverse Stands fix'd? The Mast, and frighted Bird at once Tremble; And all the Cirque with Shouts resounds. Next eager Mnestheus with his bended Bow Stands ready, and his Eyes and Arrow aim'd Directs to Heav'n; yet could not reach the Dove Her self, unfortunate; but cut the Knots, And hempen Ligaments, in which she hung Ty'd by the Feet upon the lofty Mast: She flies into the Winds, and dusky Clouds. Eurytion then impatient, and long since Holding his ready Bow, and fitted Steel, Invokes his Brother; and, in open Air Seeing the Dove now shake her sounding Wings, Transfixes her amidst the Clouds: The Bird Falls dead, and leaves her Life among the Stars; And, tumbling, in her Body brings him back His sticking Arrow. The victorious Palm Thus lost, Acestes now alone remains; Yet throws a Shaft into the empty Air, Shewing at once his Art, and sounding Bow. Here to their Eyes a Prodigy appears, Sudden, important: Which in after-times The great Event declar'd; And Prophets skill'd In Augury, and dire Portents, tho' late, Explain'd the Omen. For in liquid Clouds The flying Arrow kindled; mark'd its Way With Flames; and vanish'd in the fleeting Winds. As Stars oft falling draw a fiery Trail Of Hair, and whizzing shoot along the Sky. Amaz'd the Trojans, and Trinacrians stand, And pray the Gods: Nor does th'illustrious Chief Refuse the Omen; but embracing close Joyful Acestes, loads him with his Gifts Magnificently great, and Thus proceeds. Father, take you the Prize; For Heav'n's high King To You, by such auspicious Signs reveal'd, Honour above the common Lot decrees. This Present of Anchises' self receive, A Bowl emboss'd with Figures, which long since Thrëician Cisseus to my Father gave, To old Anchises; as a lasting Pledge, And Monument of Friendship. Thus he spoke; And with a verdant Laurel crown'd his Head; And to Acestes gave the Victor's Name. Nor did the good Eurytion disallow That Preference of Honour; tho' himself Alone transfix'd the Bird among the Clouds. The Next Reward to Him is giv'n, who cut The hempen Ligaments; the Fourth, to Him Who lodg'd his feather'd Arrow in the Mast. But good Æneas, having not dismiss'd As yet the solemn Sports, Epitydes The Governour of young Iülus calls, And whispers Thus into his faithful Ear. Go; bid Ascanius, if his Troop of Boys Be ready, and his Steeds prepar'd for View, Bring to his Grandsire's Tomb his young Brigade; And shew himself in Arms. Thus having spoke, He bids retire into a Circuit wide The mingled Croud; and clears the spacious Field. The Striplings march in Ranks, and shine alike On manag'd Steeds before their Parents' Eyes: Them, as they go, with Murmurs of Applause The Trojan and Trinacrian Youth admire: All had their Hair, by Rite accustom'd, press'd With Garlands shorn: All bore two cornel Spears Prefix'd, and sharpen'd with a Point of Steel: Some smooth light Quivers on their Shoulders wore; And o'er their Breasts, about their Necks, hung down A winding Circle of obtorted Gold. Three Troops of Horse are form'd; Three Chiefs ride round; And following each of These twelve Warriour Boys, In Corps distinct, with equal Leaders, shine. One youthful Band exulting Priam led, Bearing his Grandsire's Name; thy Princely Son, Polites, destin'd after to increase Th'Italians: Him a Thracian Courser bore Distinct with Spots; his Fore-feet mark'd with White, His snow-white Forehead toss'd aloft in Air. Atys the Next; from whom the Attian Race Of Romans come; Atys, the beauteous Boy, And by the young Iülus lov'd: The Last, And graceful in his Bloom, above them All, Iülus shines on his Sidonian Steed, Which fairest Dido gave him as a Pledge, And Monument of Love. The other Youths Ride on Trinacrian Coursers of the King, Aged Acestes. The Trojans with Applause receive their Sons Anxious for Fame; delight to see them march, And in their Childrens Looks their Parents trace. When all th'Assembly, and their Fathers' Eyes, Proud on their stately Steeds, they had survey'd; To Them prepar'd Epitydes from far Loud with a Shout, and with his sounding Lash, The Signal gave: They equally divide; The three Commanders open their Brigades In sep'rate Bodies; strait recall'd they wheel Their Course, and onwards bear their hostile Darts. Then diff'rent Traverses, on various Ground, And diff'rent Counter-traverses they form; Orbs within Orbs alternately involve, And raise th'Effigy of a Fight in Arms. Now shew their Backs in Flight; Now furious turn Their Darts; Now all in Peace together ride. As when in lofty Crete (so Fame reports) The Labyrinth of old in winding Walls A mazy Way inclos'd, a thousand Paths Ambiguous, and perplex'd: by which the Steps Should by an Errour intricate, untrac'd Be still deluded: So the Trojan Boys Inextricable Motions shift, in Sport Flying, or fighting; As when Dolphins cut The Libyan, or Carpathian, skimming o'er The liquid Deep, and wanton in the Waves. These Tilts, This mimick War, Ascanius first, When with it's Walls long Alba he inclos'd, Renew'd, and to the ancient Latins taught; Which, when a Boy, himself, and his Compeers Of Trojan Race, had solemnly perform'd: The Albans taught it Theirs: Hence mighty Rome In order next receiv'd it: and preserv'd Her Founder's Honour; and the Striplings now Troy, or the Trojan Regiment, are call'd. Thus far to his Celestial Sire were paid The celebrated Games: Here Fortune first Inconstant prov'd. While various solemn Sports Honour his Tomb; down to the Trojan Fleet Saturnian Juno Iris sends from Heav'n, And breathes the Winds to speed her airy Course; Much in her Thoughts revolving: Nor was yet Her ancient Vengeance glutted in her Breast. The Virgin, seen by none, with wingy Speed Shoots thro' a thousand Colours of her Bow; Sees the vast Concourse, and surveys the Strand, The Ports deserted, and th'abandon'd Fleet. But at a distance, on the Shore retir'd, The Trojan Dames bewail'd Anchises lost; All fix'd their weeping Eyes upon the Sea; So much (alas!) so much of Ocean still To be o'erpass'd by Us, already tir'd With Voyaging! was all their gen'ral Cry: A City they implore; and loath, and dread The tedious Deep. She therefore, not unskill'd In Mischief, flings her self into the Midst, And lays aside her Goddess' Mien, and Dress; Chang'd into Beröe, the aged Wife Of Doryclus, deriv'd from Thracian Blood, For Ancestors and Offspring once renown'd; And Thus among the Trojan Matrons speaks. O Miserable! whom the Warriour Greeks Drag'd not to Death before your native Walls; O wretched Nation! What disastrous Fate Is still for thee reserv'd? Sev'n Summers now, After the Ruin of unhappy Troy, Are roll'd; since We all Lands, so many Rocks Inhospitable, and so many Stars Have measur'd: while upon the boundless Deep We roam, and flying Italy pursue, Toss'd on the Waves. Behold These kindred Realms Of Eryx; and Acestes to our Toils Indulgent: What forbids us here to fix Our Rest, and give our Citizens a Seat? O my lov'd Country! and her Gods in vain Rescu'd from hostile Rage! Shall then no Walls Be ever giv'n to Troy? Shall then These Eyes Never again Hectorean Rivers see, Xanthus, and Simöis? But come, and burn These luckless Ships, with Me: For in my Dream The Prophetess Cassandra's Ghost appear'd, Seeming to give me flaming Brands: Here seek Your Troy, she cry'd; This is your Mansion: Now Th'Occasion pushes on the great Event; Nor are such Prodigies delay'd; Behold Neptune's four Altars here; The God himself Gives Fire, and Resolution. Speaking Thus, With rapid force she snatch'd, and with her Hand On high uplifted, at a distance wav'd, And hurl'd the flaming Mischief: In Suspense Arrect, the Trojan Matrons stand aghast. Here One, the first, the eldest of them all, Pyrgo, the Royal Nurse of Priam's Sons So numerous; Think not that here you see Rhæteian Beröe, the Consort once Of Doryclus: Observe the Marks Divine Of Beauty; see the Lightning of her Eyes, See what her Spirit, what her Looks, and Voice, And what her Mien, and Manner, as she walks. My self, long since, left Beröe confin'd By Sickness, and with Indignation griev'd That She alone This Festival should want, Nor pay the Honours to Anchises due. Thus She. But with malignant Ken the Trojan Dames Uncertain first, and doubtful, eye the Ships; Doubtful, betwixt the fond unlucky Love Of present Mansions, and the Realms by Fate Inviting: When, uprais'd on even Wings, The Goddess mounts into the Air, and cuts Her Bow of spacious Arch beneath the Clouds. But at the Prodigy amaz'd, and driv'n To Madness, from the consecrated Hearths, Shrieking, they snatch the Fire; the Altars spoil; Throw Boughs, and Shrubs, and Brands: With loosen'd Reins Among the Benches Vulcan rages fierce, Among the Oars, and Decks of painted Fir. Eumelus to the woody Theatre, And old Anchises' Tomb, the Tidings brings, The Ships are burning; And Themselves behold The Smoke, and flying Cinders, in the Sky. And first Ascanius, as he led in pomp His Horse-Brigade, swift spurs his rapid Steed, Just as he was, directly to the Tents Confus'd; Nor could his Governours, half dead With Fear, detain Him: What new Frenzy's This, O miserable Citizens? He cry'd: Whither? ah! whither would you? Not the Ships Of hostile Greeks, but your own Hopes you burn; Me, your Ascanius here behold. This said, He flung his empty Helmet at his Feet, With which in Sport He rais'd the mimick War. Æneas too, and all the Trojan Troops Together haste: The Matrons, on the Shore, Fly diverse, struck with Fear; and skulking seek The Woods, and Caves; Their Enterprize they loath, And conscious shun the Light; Now chang'd, they own Their Country, and their Friends: And Juno flies Driv'n from their Breasts. Yet not for That does aught The fiery Tempest of it's Force, and Rage Abate: Beneath the warping Timber lives The smouldring Tow, and vomits lazy Smoke; A lingring Vapour eats the Ships, and o'er The Fleet's whole Bulk the pitchy Plague descends. Nor does the Labour of the Heroes aught Avail, nor Rivers pour'd upon the Flames. Then good Æneas from his Shoulders rends His Robe, invokes th'Assistance of the Gods, And stretches out his Hands. Almighty Jove, If all the Trojan be not to a Man By Thee as yet abhor'd; If human Toils Thy long experienc'd Goodness aught regard; This flaming Ruin, Father, from our Ships Remove, and save the little State of Troy: Or, what alone remains, here strike me dead, Transfix'd with Lightning, if I so deserve; And crush me with thy own avenging Hand. He scarce had spoke; When black with rushing Rain A Tempest rag'd enormous, and the Hills And Fields with Thunder shook; O'er all the Sky A Show'r with Water dark, and thicken'd Winds, Turbid descends: The Vessels from above Are fill'd; The half-burnt Timber drench'd; 'Till all The Vapour stops extinct; And all the Ships, Four only lost, are from the Pest preserv'd. Struck to the Heart at this disastrous Chance, The Trojan Chief now This, now That, revolves Within his Breast; uncertain in his Cares, Whether in Sicily he should reside, Forgetful of the Fates; or seek the Coasts Of Italy. Then aged Nautes, taught Alone by Pallas, and with pow'rful Art Illustrious made, This Oracle pronounc'd, Explaining what the mighty Wrath of Heav'n Portended, or the Scheme of Fates requir'd. He then Æneas with consoling Words Bespeaks: O Goddess-born, where-e'er the Fates Call, or recall us, let us follow still; Whate'er it be, all Fortune is subdu'd By Patience. You have here of Race Divine Trojan Acestes; Him your willing Friend, The Partner of your Cares and Counsels take: To Him deliver Those who now remain Superfluous from your Vessels lost, and Those Who weary loath your glorious Enterprize, And great Affairs; the aged Sires, and Dames, Sick of the Sea; and whatsoe'er is weak, Or timorous of Danger: Sever These From all the rest; And let them on These Coasts Fatigu'd possess their Walls: The City's Name Acesta, by Permission, shall be call'd. This Counsel of his aged Friend inflames His Breast; which still a thousand Thoughts divide: And Night, now driving on her sable Car, Possess'd the Pole: When suddenly the Form Of old Anchises seem'd to slide from Heav'n; And from his awful Mouth These Accents fell. My Son, more dear to me than Life, while Life Remain'd; my Son inur'd to Trojan Fates; Hither I come, dispatch'd by Sov'reign Jove, Who sav'd the Remnant of your Fleet from Fire, And from high Heav'n at last Compassion shew'd. Yield to the wise Advice which Nautes gives, Mature in Age; and to th'Italian Coast Transport the chosen Youth, the bravest Souls. A Nation hardy, and of Manners rough, Must by your Arms in Latium be subdu'd. But visit first th'Infernal Courts of Dis, And thro' profound Avernus come, my Son, To my Embraces: For the impious Gloom Of Tartarus accurs'd, and dreary Shades Detain not Me; But in th'Elysian Fields, And happy Regions of the Blest I dwell. Thither with copious Blood of Victims black The Virgin Sibyl shall conduct you; There Your future Progeny, and Walls by Fate Allotted, you shall learn. But now farewel: The dewy Night rolls on her middle Course; And with his panting Steeds the rising Sun Severe has breath'd upon me. Thus he said, And flew, like Smoke, into the fleeting Air. Whither, so sudden, do you whirl away? Æneas cry'd: Whom do you fly? Or who Drives you from my Embraces? Having spoke, He wakes the Embers, and the sleeping Fire; And with a holy Cake, and Censer fill'd, The Trojan Lar, and aged Vesta's Shrine Suppliant adores. Forthwith he calls his Friends, The chief Acestes; and to Them relates What Jove commanded, what his much-lov'd Sire Advis'd, and what Himself had now resolv'd. Not intricate, or long was the Debate: Nor does Acestes Those Commands refuse. They separate the Matrons for the Town; And leave the willing Populace behind, Souls nought desirous of immortal Fame. Themselves renew their Benches, and replace Their half-burnt Planks upon their Vessels, fit Their Oars, and Cables; Few, but brave in War. Mean-while Æneas with a Plough describes The City's Limits; and by Lot assigns The Houses; Ilium, and the Seat of Troy He fixes here: Rejoicing in his Realm Trojan Acestes a new Court ordains, Summons the Fathers, and dispenses Laws. Then to Idalian Venus, on the Top Of Eryx' Mount, a Temple near the Stars Is founded; and a spacious sacred Grove, And Priest, are added to Anchises' Tomb. And now both Nations nine whole Days had spent In Feasts; and Honour to the Altars paid: Soft Breezes smooth'd the Sea; and Southern Gales Frequent again invite them to the Deep: A loud Lament along the winding Shore Arises: And embracing, Night, and Day, Each other they detain: The Dames themselves, And Those, to whom e'erwhile the Ocean's Face Seem'd rough, and insupportable it's Gods, Now willingly would go, and all the Toil Of Flight endure. Them good Æneas cheers With friendly Words; and to Acestes, sprung Of kindred Lineage, weeping recommends. Three Calves to Eryx, to the Storms a Lamb He then commands to sacrifice, and loose The Cables all in order from the Shore. Himself with Olive-Foliage shorn entwines His Head; and, standing on the distant Deck, A Goblet holds, and on the briny Deep Scatters the Entrails, pouring purest Wine. A Gale, behind their Stern fresh springing, speeds Their Course; The Crew with emulation fir'd Dash the green Waves, and sweep the curling Foam. But Venus, exercis'd, mean-while, with Cares, Addresses Neptune Thus, and Thus complains. The restless Malice, and insatiate Soul Of Juno, force me, Neptune, to descend To all Intreaties. Her no Length of Time, No Piety can soften; Nor subdu'd By Jove's Command, nor by the Doom of Fate, Does she desist. For Her 'twas not enough With Hate unutterable to consume The City from amidst the Phrygian Race, And thro' all Kinds of Punishment to drag It's Relicks: Ev'n the Ashes, and the Bones Of ruin'd Troy she persecutes: The Cause Of so much Fury She, no doubt, must know. Your self can witness for me, on the Waves Of Libya what a Hurricane of late She rais'd, and mingled all the Sea with Heav'n, Confiding vainly in th'Æolian Storms; This in Your Realms presuming. Oh Shame! and Guilt! Ev'n now the Trojan Dames, Urg'd on by Her, have burnt the Fleet, and forc'd Their Friends to leave them in a Land unknown. What yet remains; permit them, I implore, To sail in safety o'er your Waves, and reach Laurentian Tyber's Mouth: if I request Things lawful; if the Fates Those Walls allow. To whom the Sov'reign of the Deep reply'd: You, Cytheréan Goddess, may expect ('Tis all but just) whate'er my Realms can give, Which gave you Birth; and I too have deserv'd Such Confidence: Oft have I curb'd the Rage, And wild Confusion of the Seas, and Sky. Nor less employ'd by Land (I here attest Xanthus, and Simöis) has been my Care For your Æneas: When Achilles dash'd In close Pursuit th'astony'd Trojan Troops Against the Walls, and many Thousands sent To Pluto; when th'encumber'd Rivers groan'd; And Xanthus could not work his Way, nor wind Himself into the Sea; Æneas then 'Gainst Peleus' mighty Son engag'd, with Gods, And Strength unequal, in a hollow Cloud I rescu'd; tho' I labour'd to o'erturn What my self built, the Walls of perjur'd Troy. And still the same my Purpose fix'd remains: Fear not; He safe shall reach th'Avernian Port, Which you desire: One only there shall be, Whom he shall seek upon the Ocean lost; One Life for Many shall be giv'n. When with These Words the awful Sire had cheer'd The Goddess, and reliev'd her Breast with Joy; His wild Sea-Steeds he joins in Harness, adds The foaming Bridles, and diffuses all The flowing Reins: In his cerulean Car Lightly he skims the Surface of the Deep: The Waves subside; The swelling Sea lies smooth Beneath the thund'ring Axle; And the Clouds Fly from the vast Horizon. Various then The Forms of his Retinue; Monstrous Whales, Old Glaucus' Train, Palæmon Ino's Son, The nimble Tritons, and all Phorcus' Band; Thetis, and Melite upon the left, Nisæe, Spio, and Cymodoce, Thalia, and the Virgin Panopea. Here Prince Æneas' thoughtful Mind soft Joy Alternate sooths: He gives Command with speed To raise the Masts, with Yards to stretch the Sails; At once They tug the Haulsers all; at once The left side now unfurl, and now the right, Now This, now That way, tack at once: The Fleet With it's own Breezes smoothly ploughs the Waves. Before them all, first Palinurus leads Th'embody'd Line; The rest commanded steer Their Course to Him: And now the dewy Night Had almost teach'd Heav'n's middle Arch: The Crew, On the hard Benches stretch'd beneath their Oars, Relax'd their weary Limbs with pleasing Rest. When, sliding from the Sky, light Somnus cuts The dusky Air, and dissipates the Shades; Thee Palinure, he seeks; to guiltless Thee Bringing dire Dreams: High on the lofty Deck He sate, in Phorbas' Shape; and Thus he spoke. Iäsian Palinure, the Seas themselves Conduct the Fleet; The even Breezes breathe; An Hour to Rest is giv'n; Recline thy Head, And from their Labour steal thy weary Eyes: My self awhile will execute thy Charge. To whom, scarce lifting up his heavy Lids, Thus Palinure replies: And wouldst thou then Persuade me not to know the Ocean's Face In Calms? And in This Monster to confide? What! Shall I trust Æneas to the false Uncertain Winds? I, who so oft have try'd The faithless Promise of th'unclouded Sky? He said; And, sticking to the Rudder fast, Held it, and gaz'd intent upon the Stars. The God then o'er his Temples shakes a Bough Wet with Lethæan Dew, and steep'd in Styx; And, as he strives, dissolves his swimming Eyes. Scarce had the first surprizing Sleep relax'd His Limbs; the God, incumbent o'er him, broke The Stern, and, with a Fragment of the Ship, Plung'd him precipitate into the Sea, And often calling on his Friends in vain. Himself flies swift into the yielding Air. Yet not the less the Fleet secure pursues Her Course along the Waves; and fearless sails, By Neptune's Promise safe. And now they reach'd The Syrens' Shallows, dang'rous heretofore, And white with Bones: Ev'n then the distant Rocks Bellow'd, incessant, with the dashing Tides. When the brave Prince perceiv'd his floating Ship, Her Pilot lost, to rove without a Guide. Himself then steers her o'er the darken'd Waves, Deep groaning; and his hapless Friend, distress'd, Laments: Thou, Palinurus, who too far Didst trust the smiling Face of Heav'n, and Sea, Shalt naked lie upon a Strand unknown. The End of the Fifth Book. BOOK the Sixth. Weeping He spoke: and loos'd the Navy's Reins; And at th'Eubœan Coasts, on Cumæ's Shore, At length arrives. They turn their Prows to Sea: The biting Anchor moors their Ships; And all The Beach is cover'd with the winding Sterns. The youthful Crew upon th'Hesperian Strand Exulting leap: Part seek the Seeds of Fire Latent in Veins of Flint; Part seize the Woods, Thick Haunts of Beasts, and Streams discover'd shew. But good Æneas to the tow'ring Fane Repairs, o'er which Apollo high presides; And to the spacious Cavern, where retir'd The venerable Sibyl dwells; to whom Prophetick Delius an extensive Soul And Mind inspires, and future Things reveals. Now Trivia's Thicket, and the golden Dome They enter. Dædalus (as Fame reports) On nimble Pinions flying Minos' Realms, Advent'rous to commit himself to Air, And by a wond'rous Voyage sailing, came To the cold North; and swift on Chalcis' Tow'r At length alighted. On These Coasts arriv'd, Phœbus, to Thee the Steerage of his Wings He consecrated; and a Temple built, Capacious, vast: Androgeos' Death engrav'd Adorns the Entrance; Then th'Athenians doom'd To pay an annual Tribute (harsh Command!) Sev'n of their Sons; The fatal Urn stands by. Full opposite the Isle of Crete appears, Answ'ring the Shore, and rais'd above the Sea. Here the dire Passion for a Bull is shewn; Pasiphäe by secret Art inclos'd; The mingled Species, and the two-form'd Birth, That Monument of execrable Lust, The Minotaur. Here That laborious Dome, And Errour intricate: But Dædalus, Pitying the Princess, and her boundless Love, The various Fraud, and Windings of the Maze Himself unravel'd, guiding with a Thread Her doubtful Steps. And not a little Part In so renown'd a Sculpture, had but Grief Permitted him, Thou, Icarus, had'st shar'd: Twice he assay'd to cast Thy Fate in Gold; Twice fell the Father's Hands. Now all the Work Throughout with curious Eyes they would have trac'd; Had not Achates sent before arriv'd, With Him, Deïphobe from Glaucus sprung, Priestess of Trivia, and the Delian God, Who Thus bespeaks the Prince: 'Tis now no Time With These Amusements to indulge your Sight; 'Twould more import you, from a Herd untouch'd To sacrifice, as Custom due requires, Sev'n Heifers, and as many chosen Sheep. Thus She; Nor were the sacred Rites delay'd: The Priestess to the lofty Temple calls The Trojans. Cut into th'Eubœan Rock A roomy Cave descended; whither lead An hundred Entrances of wide Extent, An hundred Mouths; whence rush as many Sounds, The Sibyl's Oracles. And now they reach'd The Portal: When the Virgin, 'Tis the Time Now to enquire the Doom of Fate; Behold, The God, the God, she cry'd. While thus she spoke; Before the Doors, her Looks, her Colour chang'd, Sudden; Her Hair in wild Confusion rose: Enthusiastick Fury heav'd her Breast, And throbbing Heart; More large her Form appear'd; Nor spoke she mortal Accents; when inspir'd By the more present God. Dost thou delay, Trojan Æneas, thy Requests, and Vows? Dost thou delay? she cry'd: For not 'till then The trembling Fane will open wide it's Mouths. This said, she silent stood: A chilling Fear Ran thro' the hardy Trojans' Bones; Their Prince Thus from his inmost Bosom pour'd his Pray'rs. Phœbus, who always did'st with Pity view Troy's pressing Toils, and guide the Dardan Shafts Of Paris deep into Achilles' Blood: So many Seas surrounding spacious Lands, Under thy Conduct, I have long explor'd; The far retir'd Massylians, and the Fields Extended near the Syrtes: Now at last We touch the Coasts of flying Italy. Let it suffice that Destiny thus far Has persecuted Troy: And all Ye Gods, And Goddesses, to whom the Dardan State, And mighty Ilium's envy'd Glory shone Obnoxious; 'Tis allow'd you now to spare The Trojan Race: And Thou, Celestial Maid, Skill'd in Futurity (Realms not undue By Fate I ask) permit our wand'ring Gods To fix our Colony on Latium's Coast. To Phœbus then, and Trivia I will build A Fane of solid Marble, and appoint Days festival, to honour Phœbus' Name. Thee too magnificent Apartments wait Within my Realms; Thy Fates to us reveal'd, And secret Oracles I will preserve, Propitious Maid, and chosen Men ordain. Only to Leaves commit not, I implore, Thy Numbers; lest dispers'd they fly, the Sport Of rapid Winds: but vocal sing our Fate. He ended: But impatient in her Grot Apollo's swelling Priestess wildly raves; Reluctant, lab'ring from her Breast to heave Th'incumbent God: So much the more He curbs Her foamy Mouth, subdues her madding Heart, And pressing forms her. Now spontaneous fly Wide-ope the Cavern's hundred spacious Mouths, And waft her Oracles into the Air. O Thou, who hast by Sea such Toils endur'd; By Land still greater wait thee: On the Coasts Of Latium (let not That disturb thy Breast) The Trojans shall arrive; But they shall wish They never had: Wars, horrid Wars I see, And Tyber frothing with a Tide of Gore. Another Simoïs thou shalt not want, Another Xanthus, other Doric Camps: A new Achilles is for thee prepar'd In Italy; and He too Goddess-born: Nor any where will Juno fail t'attend The Trojans. Suppliant in distress'd Affairs Whom shalt thou not, among th'Italian States, What Towns, what Nations shalt thou not implore? The Cause of so much Woe shall be again A foreign Consort to the Trojan Race, And foreign Nuptials. Submit not Thou to Dangers; but proceed More daring, than thy Fortune will allow. The Way to Safety (which you least expect) Shall from a Grecian City first be shewn. Thus the Cumæan Sibyl from her Shrine Sings mystic Verse; and bellows in her Cave, Involving Truth in Darkness: As she foams, Apollo shakes the Reins, and goads her Breast. Soon as her Fury, and her rabid Mouth Had ceas'd; the Trojan Hero Thus began. No Face of Toil, or Danger, can to me, O Virgin, new, or unexpected, rise: Long have I form'd them all within my Breast, And preconceiv'd them. One thing I implore; Since here 'tis said th'infernal Gate of Dis, And gloomy Acheron's tumultuous Gulf Are open'd; let me by permitting Fates To my lov'd Father's Sight and Presence go: Shew Thou the Way, and ope the sacred Doors. Him on These Shoulders, rescu'd from the Foe, Thro' Flames, and Storms of hostile Darts, I bore: He thro' all Oceans, Partner of my Flight, Infirm, endur'd all Threats of Sea, and Sky, Beyond his Strength, and what his Age requir'd. He too commanded me with earnest Pray'r, Suppliant to beg your Counsels, and approach Your awful Temple: Pity, I intreat, Propitious Maid, the Father and the Son: For You can all things; nor did Hecate Appoint you o'er th'Avernian Groves in vain. If Orpheus, trusting in his Thracian Lyre, And sounding Strings, could free his Consort's Ghost; If Pollux by alternate Death redeem'd His Brother, and so often goes, and comes: Why should I name brave Theseus? or the great Alcides? And I too descend from Jove. Thus He before the Altars suppliant pray'd; Then Thus the Prophetess: Anchises' Son, Trojan, of Race celestial; The Descent To Hell is easy; Night and Day the Gate Of gloomy Dis stands open: But to turn One's Steps, and re-ascend to upper Air, There, there's the arduous Task. A few, belov'd By fav'ring Jove, and by transcendent Worth Rais'd to the Stars, of heav'nly Parents born, This Privilege could gain. The middle Space Is all o'ergrown with Woods, and all around Inclos'd by black Cocytus' winding Stream. But if so fond a Love, such strong Desire Inflame thee twice to sail the Stygian Lake, And twice to visit the Tartarean Gloom, Delighting to indulge so vast a Toil; Attend to what must previous be perform'd. Within a shady Tree there grows retir'd A Bough, with Leaves, and pliant Sprigs of Gold, Held sacred to th'Infernal Queen: This Branch The Grove all covers, and in Vales obscure The Shades surround: But 'tis allow'd to None The subterranean Regions to explore, 'Till from That Tree he crops the golden Shoot. This Gift the fair Proserpina ordains An Off'ring to her self: The first pluck'd off, Still other Gold succeeds, another Twig With the same vegetable Metal blooms. Thou therefore search it with uplifted Eyes, And crop it with thy Hand, by Rite prescrib'd. For if the Fates have destin'd thee, with ease Spontaneous it will bend, and meet thy Touch; Else, by no Strength or Steel it will be hewn. Besides, a lifeless Body of thy Friend There lies (alas! thou know'st it not) and all The Navy his unbury'd Coarse pollutes; While thou art here consulting Fate's Decree, And ling'ring at my Doors: Him first commit To his due Earth, and hide him in a Tomb; Black Victims (Those the first Lustrations) bring; And then at last the Stygian Groves, and Realms Impervious to the Living thou shalt see. She ended; and her Mouth in silence clos'd. Æneas pensive, and with downcast Eyes, Leaving the Cave, walks musing, and revolves Within his secret Mind the dark Events. Achates, faithful Partner, by his Side With equal Cares accompanies his Steps. Much by themselves, and variously they talk, What lifeless Friend the Priestess should design, What Corps to be interr'd: And as they came, They saw Misenus on the naked Shore, By a disastrous Death untimely slain. Misenus, Son of Æolus, than whom None more expert with sounding Brass to rouse The Troops, and fire the Battle with Alarms. He first great Hector follow'd; fam'd in Fight, Near Hector's Person, for his Fife, and Spear. Him when Achilles Conqu'rour robb'd of Life; The valiant Hero to Æneas' Train Added Himself; nor then obey'd a Lord Inferiour. But when o'er the Sea he blew His sounding Conch, and madly dar'd the Gods To Emulation; Him (if such a Fame Be credible) his Rival Triton plung'd Among the Rocks into the foaming Deep. Therefore with loud Laments all round him mourn, Chiefly the pious Prince: Without Delay Weeping they execute the Sibyl's Charge; Industrious to erect with Trees, and build To Heav'n the Altar of his Fun'ral Pile, Into an ancient Wood, the deep Recess Of Beasts they go: Down fall the pitchy Pines; With Blows of Axes Oaks, and Ashen Trunks, And splitting Timber, cleft with Wedges, sound; And from the Hills the lofty Beeches roll. Æneas foremost, with like Weapons arm'd, Encourages his Friends, and aids their Toil: These Thoughts revolves within his anxious Breast; And, looking round the Wood's immense Extent, Thus prays. May now to us That golden Branch It self discover in so vast a Grove; Since all things true, alas! too true of Thee, Misenus, the Prophetick Virgin told. He scarce had spoke; When full before his Eyes Two Doves by chance came flying thro' the Sky, And pitch'd upon the verdant Ground: The Chief Soon knows his Mother's Birds, and joyful prays. Be You my Guides, if any Way there lie, And to That Wood direct my Course thro' Air, Where the rich Bough o'ershades the fertil Ground: And Thou, O heav'nly Parent, in These Doubts Desert me not. He said; and fix'd his Steps, Observing close what Signal they would give, And whither tend. With interrupted Flight They feeding move before him, just as far As Those behind could keep them still in view: When to Avernus' stenchy Jaws they came; Swiftly they mount, and thro' the liquid Air Both gliding at the wish'd-for Place alight, Upon That Tree, from whence, among the Boughs, Discolour'd shone the gleamy Air of Gold. As Misletoe in Woods, in Winter's Frost, Not by its own congenial Plant produc'd, Is wont to spring with recent Leaves, and round The Trunks in Ringlets twines its yellow Shoots: Such was the Figure of the blooming Gold, Within the Oak o'ershading; So the Bark Metallick tinkled with the gentle Wind. Æneas eager crops the lingring Branch With Haste, and bears it to the Sibyl's Cave. Nor less, mean-while, the Trojans on the Shore Weep o'er Misenus; and the last sad Rites Pay to his senseless Ashes: First a Pile With Timber cleft, and unctuous Pitch-Trees high They build; with gloomy Boughs entwine it's Sides, Before it fun'ral Cypresses erect, And grace it all above with shining Arms. Warm Liquors, Some, and Cauldrons from the Fire Boiling, dispatch; first wash, and then anoint His cold, stiff Limbs: A gen'ral Groan succeeds; Then, mourning, on the Bed his Corps they lay, And o'er it throw the purple Robes, the Veil Accustom'd: Some support the pond'rous Bier, (Sad Ministry!) and, by the ancient Rite, With Faces turn'd away, beneath the Pyre Hold flaming Brands: Together blended burn Off'rings of Incense, Flesh, and Jars of Oil. Soon as the Ashes fell, and Flames expir'd; Th'imbibing Cinders, and the last Remains They drench with Wine; and in a brazen Urn The Bones collected Chorinæus hides: Then thrice with limpid Water sprinkles round Th'Assembly, from the fertil Olive-Bough; With dewy Moisture purifies his Friends, Concludes the Rites, and speaks the last Farewel. But good Æneas rear'd a stately Tomb, The Hero's Arms, his Oar, and Trumpet fix'd, Beneath a lofty Mountain; which from Him Is now Misenus call'd, and keeps it's Name To everlasting Ages. This perform'd, He executes with speed the Sibyl's Charge. A Cave profound there was, with yawning Mouth Capacious, stony, with a darksom Lake, And gloomy Grove defended; o'er whose Gulph None of the Feather'd Kind might wing their way With safety; such a Vapour thick exhal'd From it's black Jaws ascended to the Sky! From whence the Greeks the Place Avernus nam'd. Four Bullocks first, with Hides of sable Hue, The Priestess here before the Altars plac'd; And full upon their Foreheads downwards pour'd The Wine: Then plucking from between their Horns Their foremost Hairs, into the holy Fire The first Oblation flings; invoking loud Great Hecate, potent in Hell, and Heav'n. Some, sticking Knives beneath, in Bowls receive The tepid Blood: Æneas with his Sword Himself dispatches to th'Infernal Pow'rs, The Mother of the Furies, and to Earth Her Sister-Deity, a black Ewe-Lamb, And, Proserpine, a barren Cow to Thee. Then to the Stygian Monarch he begins The nightly Sacrifice; the solid Flesh Of Bulls upon the flaming Altar lays, And o'er their burning Entrails pours the Oil. Lo! at the Sun's first Light, and dawning Day, The Ground began to groan beneath their Feet; The Woods, upon the Mountains, nodding shook; And thro' the Shade the howling Dogs foretold The coming Goddess: Hence, the Priestess cry'd, Hence, Ye Profane; from all the Grove retire: And Thou invade the Passage, with thy Steel Unsheath'd; Now, now, Æneas, is the time For Courage, and a stedfast Mind. This said, Furious she plung'd into the open Cave: He equals with intrepid Steps his Guide. Ye Gods, who rule o'er Ghosts, and silent Shades, Chaos, and Phlegethon; Ye spacious Fields Of silent Night: Let me permitted speak What I have heard, and Authoriz'd by You Disclose Things hid in Darkness, and deep Earth. Lonely They went, in Night obscure, thro' Shades, Thro' Pluto's empty Courts, and airy Realms. Such is the solitary Walk in Woods, By the uncertain Moon's malignant Gleam; When Jove in Darkness has involv'd the Sky, And Objects lose their Colour by the Night. Just in the Entrance, and first Jaws of Hell, Grief, and revengeful Cares their Couches plac'd; And pale Diseases, querulous Old Age, Fear, ill-persuading Hunger, and foul Want; (Forms dreadful to behold!) and Death, and Pain; And Sleep a-kin to Death; the Mind's false Joys; And, in the adverse Portal, deadly War. The Furies' iron Beds; and Discord wild, Her vip'rous Locks with bloody Fillets bound. Full in the Midst a tall and dusky Elm Displays it's Boughs, and aged Limbs: This Seat (Such is the Fame) fantastic Dreams possess, And stick beneath the Leaves. Then monstrous Beasts, Of various Figure: Centaurs, in the Doors, And two-shap'd Scylla's stable; Briareus Hundred-fold Giant; Lerna's Snake with Hiss Terrific, and Chimæra arm'd with Flames; Gorgons, and Harpys, and the hideous Form Of the three-body'd Fantom. Here, surpriz'd With sudden Fear, Æneas grasps his Sword, And obvious, as they come, the Blade unsheath'd Presents: And had not his experienc'd Guide Advis'd him, that Those unimbody'd Shades Fly fleeting, and impassive; He had rush'd, Beating thin Air, and stabbing Ghosts in vain. Hence to Tartarean Acheron's fierce Waves The Way directs; Here turbid, thick with Mud Voraginous, boils a vast whirling Gulph, And to Cocytus disembogues the Sand. Charon, the griesly Ferryman of Hell, This River keeps, and on These Surges waits; Horrid with dreadful Filth. Much hoary Beard Lies on his Chin uncultivate; His Eyes Stand fix'd in Flame; Down from his Shoulder hangs In Knot his foul Attire: The God himself Shoves with a Pole his Boat, and spreads his Sails, And in his sable Skiff transports the Ghosts, Now Senior, but in fresh and green Old Age. Hither in Throngs they crouded to the Bank; Matrons, and Men, Souls of brave Heroes dead, Boys, and unmarry'd Girls, and Youths consum'd On Fun'ral-piles before their Parents' Eyes. Unnumber'd, as the Leaves, which fall in Woods, By Autumn's first sharp Blasts: Or as the Birds Which flock from Sea to Land; when the cold Year Drives them beyond Sea, seeking warmer Climes. Praying they stood, first to be wafted o'er; And, longing for the farther Bank, their Hands Extended: But the surly Boatman, deaf To all their Cries, now These, now Those receives; But drives the rest at distance from the Beach. Æneas (for That Tumult much surpriz'd, And struck his Soul) Thus speaks: O sacred Maid, Tell me, what means This Concourse to the Lake? What do the Ghosts desire? And why distinct Leave These the Banks, while Others sweep with Oars The livid Ford? To Him in brief replies The aged Priestess. Great Anchises' Son, Undoubted Offspring of the Gods; You see Profound Cocytus, and the Stygian Pool; Whose Deity the Gods by Oaths revere, And dread to violate. This Croud is All Distress'd, and unintomb'd: That Ferryman Is Charon; Those who sail the Lake, interr'd. But 'tis not giv'n to pass the horrid Banks, And hoarse-resounding Fluent; 'till in Graves Their Bones are laid: An hundred Years they rove, And flutter round These Shores; and then at length Admitted, to the wish'd-for Stream return. Fix'd stood Anchises' Son, repress'd his Steps, Much musing; and the hard, unequal Fate Commiserates: Leucaspis here he sees, And the Commander of the Lycian Fleet Orontes, mourning, and deny'd the Rites Of Honours due to Death; whom, toss'd from Troy O'er stormy Billows, Auster overwhelm'd, Involving in the Waves the Ship, and Men. Lo! Palinure with wand'ring Steps mov'd slow, The Pilot, who, as he observ'd the Stars Late, in the Libyan Voyage, from the Stern Fell plung'd into the Middle of the Deep. When scarce He knew him pensive, thro' the Shades, Thus first: Who, Palinure, of all the Gods Snatch'd thee from Us, and drown'd thee in the Sea? O speak; For never faithless found 'till Now Apollo by This Oracle alone Deluded me; Pronouncing from his Shrine That Thou shouldst pass the Ocean safe, and reach Ausonia's Coasts. Is This the promis'd Faith? Then He; Nor you has Phœbus' Shrine deceiv'd, Brave Prince, Anchises' Son; Nor did the God Plunge me into the Sea. For as I held The Rudder, sticking fast, and steer'd our Course; Falling, I drew it, with me, torn by chance With mighty Violence. By the stormy Seas I swear, I never for my self conceiv'd So great a Fear, as lest your Ship should fail, Robb'd of her Rudder, and her Pilot lost, Amidst the Tossing of such boist'rous Waves. Three Nights tempestuous o'er the boundless Deep Rough Notus bore me; Scarce upon the fourth Appearing Dawn, I saw th'Italian Coast, High from the topmost Billow. By degrees I swam to Land: and now had safe arriv'd; Had not the cruel Nation, as I catch'd With grasping Hands the Mountain's rugged Sides, Clogg'd in my brine-drench'd Garments, with the Sword Invaded me, and ignorant suppos'd They gain'd a Prize. My Body now is wrapp'd In Waves, and roll'd by Winds along the Shore. Wherefore, by Heav'n's refreshing Light and Air, By your lov'd Father, by the rising Hope Of young Iülus, free me from These Woes, Unconquerable Chief. Or You, your self, Cast Earth upon me, (for You can,) and seek The Velin Port: Or if a Way there be, If any Way your Goddess Mother shew; (For sure without the Favour of the Gods You never would, I think, attempt to pass Such mighty Rivers, and the Stygian Lake) Give wretched Me your Hand, and o'er the Waves Transport me with Your self; that I may find A Mansion of Repose, at least in Death. He said; and Thus the Prophetess reply'd. Whence, Palinure, in thee does This Desire So impious rise? Shalt Thou unbury'd see That River, and the Furies' dreary Stream, Or unpermitted pass the Stygian Bank? Forbear to hope the Destinies Divine Can ever with Intreaties be subdu'd. Yet mindful take This Solace of thy Woe; For far and wide th'adjoining Cities, urg'd By Prodigies Celestial, shall attone Thy Ashes, build a Tomb, and solemn Rites Perform: And to eternal Ages fam'd The Place shall Palinurus' Name retain. These Words relieve his Cares, and for a-while Ease his sad Soul; With pleasure he reflects Upon the Land distinguish'd by his Name. They now pursue their Way, and near the Stream Arrive: Them soon as from the Stygian Sound The Steersman saw, thro' the brown silent Grove, Approaching to the Bank; He first with Speech Accosts them, challenging. Whoe'er Thou art Who arm'd art making to our River; speak The Causes of thy Coming, and presume No farther to advance: This Place to Ghosts Is all assign'd, to Sleep, and drowsy Night; 'Tis not permitted in the Stygian Boat The Bodies of the Living to convey. Nor was it Joy to me, that I receiv'd Alcides in his Passage o'er my Lake, Nor Theseus, nor Perithöus; tho' born Of heav'nly Race, and Matchless in their Might. The First in Chains th'infernal Mastiff seiz'd, And drag'd him trembling from our Monarch's Throne: The Rest attempted from his Bed to force Great Pluto's Queen. To Him in brief replies Th'Amphrysian Prophetess: No Plots like These (Dismiss thy Apprehensions) here are meant; Nor do These Weapons threaten hostile Wrongs: Still may the monstrous Porter in his Den Eternal, barking fright the bloodless Shades; And still may chaste Proserpina remain Within her Uncle's Court. Æneas sprung From Troy, renown'd in Piety, and Arms, Descends, to see his Father, to the Waves Of Erebus profound. If by the Image Of so much Piety thou art not mov'd; This Bough at least acknowledge: With those Words. She shew'd the Bough, which lay beneath her Robe Conceal'd. His swelling Choler strait subsides; Nor more: He wond'ring at the fatal Branch, That venerable Passport long unseen; Turns his cerulean Skiff, and to the Bank Approaches: Other Ghosts, which sate in Rows Along the Deck, he then removes; and clears His Hatches; and at once receives on Board The great Æneas; Lab'ring with his Weight The Leathern Sculler groans, and leaky sucks The rushing Waves: At length beyond the Stream The Hero and the Priestess safe he lands, On the grey Sedges, and unsightly Mud. The Monster Cerberus with three-mouth'd Bark Howls thro' These Realms; within his Den adverse Outstretch'd enormous. When the Priestess saw The Snakes with horrour swelling round his Neck; She flings a Cake of medicated Meal, And soporific Honey: He, with Rage Of Hunger op'ning wide his triple Throat, Snatches the Morsel; and, his spacious Chine Relaxing, lies extended on the Ground, And with his Vastness covers all the Cave. The Watch thus laid asleep; Æneas swift Seizes the Passage, and behind him leaves The Border of th'irremeable Lake. First shrill Laments, and slender Cries are heard, The Ghosts of Infants weeping in the Door: Whom, of sweet Life abridg'd, and from the Breast Untimely snatch'd, the fatal Day cut off, And in a Fun'ral immature involv'd. Next Those who by an Accusation false Were doom'd to Death. Nor are Those Seats assign'd Unjudg'd, or lotless: Minos shakes the Urn, Inquisitor; He calls the silent Shades To Council; and their Lives, and Crimes explores. The next allotted Mansions Those possess, Wailing, who innocent procur'd their Death By their own Hands; and, sick of Living, flung Their Souls away: How gladly would they Now The Pain of Toils and Poverty endure In upper Light! The Destinies forbid; Them Styx, unlovely Lake, with dreary Waves Hems in, and nine times interfus'd, confines. Not far from hence extended wide are shewn The Mourning Fields; To them That Name is giv'n. Here Those, whom unrelenting Love consum'd With cruel pining Sickness, secret Walks O'ershadow, and a Myrtle Grove around Conceals: Their Cares in Death it self survive. Phædra, and Procris, in These Fields he sees; And weeping Eryphile, shewing here The Wounds she from her cruel Son receiv'd; Evadne, and Pasiphäe; with Them Laodamia walks; and Cæneus once A Man, a Woman first, and by the Turn Of Fate, into her former Sex revolv'd. Among the rest, fresh reeking from her Wound, In the vast Grove Phœnician Dido roams: Soon as the Trojan Hero near her stood, And knew her thro' the dusky Shade, as when At the first Op'ning of the Month one sees, Or thinks one sees, thro' Clouds the rising Moon; Tears he lets fall, and Thus with fondness speaks. Was it then true, Unhappy Dido? True The Tidings I receiv'd, that by the Sword Dying you had pursu'd the last Extremes? Your Death, alas! I caus'd: But by the Stars, And by the Gods I swear, by all the Faith Beneath the Earth, if any such there be; Unwillingly, O Queen, I left your Coasts. But the Celestial Pow'rs, who force me now To travel thro' These Shades, These squalid Realms, And Night profound, urg'd me by Their Commands; Nor could I think that such excessive Grief To You by my Departure would be caus'd: Whom fly you? Stay; nor from my Sight withdraw; 'Tis the last Interview our Fate allows. Thus Her with Indignation frowning, stern, With Tears, and Blandishments Æneas sooth'd: She bends her Eyes averse upon the Ground; And by his Speech begun is mov'd no more, Than a hard Flint, or fix'd Marpesian Rock. At length she flits away, and from his Sight Detested whirls into the shady Grove; Where her Sichæus, her first plighted Lord, Answers her Cares, and equals all her Love. Nor less Æneas her hard Fate bewails, And far with Tears pursues her, as she flies. Then speeds his destin'd Way; and now they reach The last allotted Fields, possess'd by Chiefs In War illustrious. Tydeus meets him here, And brave Parthenopæus, fam'd in Arms, And pale Adrastus' Ghost: Here Leaders sprung From Troy, who fell in Battle, much deplor'd In upper Life; whom he beholding, groan'd, As there in long extended Ranks they stood: Glaucus, and Medon, and Thersilochus, Antenor's three Sons, Polybætes, Priest Of Ceres, and Idæus, ev'n in Death Retaining still his Chariot, and his Arms. On either side the thronging Ghosts stand round; Nor them suffices to have seen him Once: Delighted, they detain him long, and walk Familiar, and confer, and ask the Cause Of his Arrival. But the Grecian Lords, And Agamemnon's Squadrons, when they saw The Hero shining thro' the Shades in Arms, Tremble with sudden Fear: Some turn their Backs In Flight, as to their Ships they once retir'd: Some raise a slender Cry; Th'abortive Scream Dies in their Throats, and stifles half the Sound. Here Priam's Son Deïphobus he sees, Butcher'd thro' all his Body; with his Face Inhumanly disfigur'd o'er; his Face, And both his Hands, his Temples hack'd, his Ears Hewn off, and with an indecorous Wound His Nostrils mangled. Him when scarce he knew Trembling with Shame, and striving to conceal His dire Indignities; with well-known Voice He first begins. Deïphobus, renown'd In Arms, deriv'd from Teucer's Royal Blood; Who had the Will, or Pow'r on Thee t'inflict Such cruel, barb'rous Treatment? Fame to Me Reported, that in Troy's last Night you fell, Fatigu'd with mighty Slaughter of the Greeks, Upon their Heaps confus'd. An empty Tomb Strait on the Rhætian Shore I rear'd, and thrice Aloud invok'd thy Manes: Still the Place Retains thy Name, and Arms. Thy self, my Friend, I could not find; nor, from our Native Soil Departing, in a Grave thy Corps compose. To whom Priamides: By You, my Friend, Nothing has been omitted; All the Rites To dead Deïphobus you have perform'd. But me my Fate, and Helen's murd'rous Fraud Plung'd in These Woes; These Monuments she left. For how we wasted in delusive Mirth That last of Nights to Troy, too well you know; Nor can the sad Remembrance be effac'd. When o'er high Pergamus the fatal Steed Ascended huge, and pregnant from his Womb Disclos'd an Army: She, a festal Dance Pretending, round the Orgies led in pomp The Bacchanalian Dames of Troy; Herself Holds a vast flaming Taper in the Midst, And from the Cittadel invites the Greeks. Then I, o'erwhelm'd with Cares, and plung'd in Sleep, Lay on my fatal Bed, dissolv'd in Rest Sweet, and profound, and like a pleasing Death. Mean-while my precious Consort from my House Removes all Arms, and from my Pillow steals My faithful Sword; wide open flings the Gates, And to my Palace Menelaüs calls: Hoping, belike, by That to reconcile Her injur'd Lord, and for her former Crimes By That important Service to attone. Short let me be; They burst into my Room: With them That Traitor of th'Æolian Race, Encourager of Villany, is join'd. Ye Gods, repay such Treatment to the Greeks, If 'tis with pious Pray'r I beg Revenge. But by what Fortune, tell me in your Turn, Living arrive You here? By Stress of Sea Wand'ring, and toss'd? Or warn'd by Pow'rs Divine? Or what Fate urges you to visit Realms Joyless, and unillumin'd by the Sun, These turbid Regions? Thus while mutual Speech They chang'd alternate; in her rosy Car Aurora now had finish'd half her Course Ethereal: And perhaps in Talk like This Their whole allotted Time they would have spent; But Thus in brief the Sibyl Guide advis'd. The Night rolls on, Æneas; We by Tears Protract the Time: Here lies a Way, which parts In Two; The Right to awful Pluto's Court, And to Elysium leads Us; but the Left To the Tartarean Gloom, and tortur'd Damn'd. To Her Deïphobus: Be not displeas'd, Great Priestess; Chide me not: I will retire, My Number fill, and render back my self To Darkness: Go, Our Glory; Go, and prove A better Fate. He said; and at the Word Turn'd, and withdrew. Æneas looks behind Sudden, and sees, beneath the left-hand Rock, An ample City, with a triple Wall Begirt; which, rolling on it's rapid Tide, Tartarean Phlegethon with torrent Flames Incloses round, and whirls the rattling Stones. A spacious Gate adverse, and Pillars hewn From solid Adamant; which human Force None can subdue, nor ev'n the Gods with Steel Can cut: An iron Tow'r stands high in Air; And pale Tisiphone, clad in a Gown Deep dy'd in Blood, before the Portal sits, And sleepless, day and night, the Entrance guards. Hence Groans are heard, and lashing Whips, the Din Of Iron, and the Clank of dragging Chains. Startled with Fear, and listning to the Noise, Æneas stood: O tell me, sacred Maid, What Scene of Crimes is This? What Pains? And what Such loud Laments, ascending to the Sky? To whom the Sibyl Priestess Thus reply'd. None that is pure, Illustrious Trojan Chief, May enter There, or tread th'unhallow'd Ground: But Hecate, when o'er th'Avernian Groves She gave me Charge, led me thro' all, and told The Vengeance of the Gods. These ruthless Realms By Cretian Rhadamanthus are possess'd: He punishes, and hears their secret Guilt; Compels them to confess their hidden Crimes, Which, with the vain Dissimulation pleas'd, Each had protracted, in the upper World, To his late Hour of Death. The vengeful Pest Tisiphone then frights the guilty Ghosts, Arm'd with her Whip, insulting; threat'ning, waves With her Left hand her griesly Snakes, and calls The grim Assembly of her Sister-Fiends. Then with a dismal Jarring, on their Hinge, Grating harsh Noise, the execrable Gates At length are open'd: What a Sentry sits, You see; and what a Figure guards the Door. More dire the monstrous Hydra, lodg'd within, Opens with pitchy Yawn her fifty Throats: Then Tartarus it self sinks twice as low, Beneath the Shades descending, wide, and deep, As tends the upper Prospect to the Sky. Here the old Earth-born Offspring, Titan's Sons, Roll, struck with Lightning, in the vast Abyss. The two Alöides I here beheld Of mighty Stature; who with impious Hands Assail'd the Sky, and from his Seat supreme Attempted to dethrone the King of Heav'n. Salmoneus' penal Torments too I saw, Who mimick'd Thunder, and the Flames of Jove. He by four Horses drawn, along the Streets Of Elis' City, and the Grecian Towns, And brandishing a Torch, Triumphant rode, And to himself celestial Honours claim'd: Infatuate, with a brazen Bridge, and Hoofs Of noisy trampling Steeds, to counterfeit Th'inimitable Lightning, and the Storms. But the Almighty Father lanc'd a Bolt Thro' the thick Clouds (a Bolt He lanc'd, not Brands, And smoking Tow) and drove him headlong hurl'd With the vast Swing, and Whirlwind of his Arm. There Tityus, Son of the all-bearing Earth, One might behold: Whose Body's monstrous Bulk Lies stretch'd o'er nine whole Acres; and a huge Portentous Vultur, with her hooky Beak Pouncing his everlasting Liver, thrives Upon his Entrails fruitful of their Pains; Rummages for her Meals, inhabits deep Beneath his Breast; nor do the Fibres find The least Relief from Torment, still renew'd. Why should I name the Lapithæan Race? Ixion? and Perithöus? O'er whom Hangs a black Flint, just tumbling now, just falling Down in Appearance. Lofty genial Beds On golden Pillars shine; And Feasts prepar'd With Royal Luxury, before their Eyes: Near them the Eldest of the Furies sits, Prohibits them from touching with their Hands The Dishes; rises, tossing in the Air Her flaming Torch, and thunders with her Voice. Here Those, who, while their Term of Life endur'd, Hated their Brethren, or against their Fathers Lifted their Hands; Those who with Fraud betray'd Their Client's Cause; and Those who brooded o'er Their Wealth acquir'd alone, nor to their Friends Assign'd a Portion; (These the greatest Croud:) They too who for Adultery were slain; And They who in illegal Wars engag'd, Nor trembled to deceive their Masters' Faith, Imprison'd wait their Doom. Seek not to know What Doom, what fatal Sentence, or what Form Of Punishment: Some roll a pond'rous Rock, And on the Spokes of Wheels distended hang: There sits, and to Eternity will sit Unhappy Theseus: And, advising all, The wretched Phlegyas with his Voice aloud There Testifies, and Preaches thro' the Shades; “Be warn'd, learn Justice, nor contemn the Gods. One sold his Country, and a Tyrant's Rule Impos'd; for Bribes made Laws, and Laws repeal'd. Another by forbidden Nuptials seiz'd His Daughter's Bed: All most flagitious Crimes Daring, and executing what they dar'd. Had I an hundred Tongues, an hundred Mouths, An iron Voice; I could not comprehend The various Villanies with all their Names, The various Forms, and Punishments of Vice. When Phœbus' aged Priestess Thus had spoke; But haste, she said, pursue your Way, complete The Off'ring you design'd: I see the Walls Wrought in the Cyclops' Forges, and the Gates With Arch adverse; where we our Gift prescrib'd Must by Command deposite. Thus she spoke; And Both together, thro' the gloomy Walks, O'ershoot the middle Space, and to the Doors Approach: Æneas to the Entrance hastes, His Body with fresh Water sprinkles o'er, And in the fronting Portal sticks the Bough. The Rites thus finish'd, and the Off'ring due Paid to the Goddess; to the Realms of Joy At length they come, and to the blissful Greens, Fortunate Groves, and Mansions of the Bless'd. An Ether more enlarg'd here cloaths the Fields With purple Light: and their own proper Sun, And proper Stars they know. On grassy Meads Some wrestling exercise their Limbs, contend In Sport, and struggle on the yellow Sand. Others in Dances artful Measures beat, And Verse recite: With These the Thracian Priest, In his long Garment, sev'n Divisions sings In tuneful Numbers; on the same by turns His Fingers, and his Iv'ry Quill employs. Here, Teucer's ancient Race, th'illustrious Line, Heroes renown'd, in happier Ages born; Ilus, Assaracus, and Dardanus Founder of Troy. With Wonder they behold Their Arms, and empty Chariots on the Plain At distance rang'd: Their Spears stand fix'd in Earth; And loose o'er all the Fields their Horses feed: The same Delight in Chariots, and in Arms, And shining Steeds, which living they conceiv'd, Pursues them still beneath the Earth repos'd. Others on either hand he sees reclin'd In Feasts along the Grass, and Pæans sweet Singing in Chorus, in the fragrant Grove Of Laurel: whence, descending thro' the Wood, Eridanus abundant rolls his Waves. Here, Those who for their Country Wounds endur'd In War; And holy Priests, while Life remain'd; And pious Poets, who recited Things Worthy of Phœbus; Those who polish'd Life With Arts invented; Or consign'd their Names To Memory by well-deserving Deeds. Their Heads are all with snow-white Fillets wreath'd: Whom gather'd round the Sibyl thus bespeaks; Chiefly Musæus: For th'inclosing Croud Of Ghosts look up to Him, above the rest Standing superiour with his Shoulders tall. Tell us, Ye happy Spirits, and Thou best Of Poets; say, what Place, what Region holds Anchises? For his sake we hither came, And the wide Streams of Erebus o'erpass'd. To whom the Hero Thus in brief reply'd. None have fix'd Seats; We live in shady Groves, And Beds of Banks, and Meadows fresh with Rills Inhabit. But if such be your Desire, Ascend This Hill; and to an easy Path I will conduct your Steps. This said, he leads; And shews them from above the shining Fields: They thence descend, and leave the Mountain's height. But old Anchises in a verdant Vale By chance review'd the separated Ghosts, Destin'd to upper Light; recounted All With studious Recollection; and survey'd The Number of his darling Race, their Fates, Their Fortunes, Manners, and Heroic Deeds. He, when Æneas thro' the Meads adverse He saw advancing forward, both his Hands With Joy extended; Tears ran trickling down His Cheeks; And from his Mouth these Accents fell. Are you then come at last? And has at last Your filial Piety, by me so long Experienc'd, conquer'd such a Journey's Toil? Is it then giv'n me to behold your Face, My Son? and well-known Accents hear, and speak? So I indeed was casting in my Mind, And calculating Times: Nor did my Care Delude me: Thro' what Lands, what Oceans toss'd, What Perils, You, my Son, do I receive? How did I fear from Libya's Realms for You! Then He: Your Ghost, my Father, your sad Ghost Oft urg'd my Journey to This Clime. Our Ships Ride in the Tyrrhene Sea. Give, Father, give Your Hand to join with mine; nor from my Sight Your self withdraw. So saying, he bedew'd His Face with flowing Tears: And thrice assay'd About his Neck to throw his folding Arms; Thrice, vainly grasp'd at, from their Circle flew Th'unbody'd Fantom; light as fleeting Winds, And like a slipp'ry Dream. Meanwhile He sees A Grove secluded in a secret Vale, Shrubs rattling in the Woods, and Lethe's Stream, Which near the peaceful Mansions glides along; Round which unnumber'd Crouds, and Nations flew. As when the Bees in Meads, while Summer shines, On various Flowers alight, and hover o'er The snow-white Lilies: All the Field resounds With humming Noise. Struck at the sudden Sight, Surpriz'd, and ignorant, Æneas asks The Cause; Enquires, what River That? and Who The thronging Ghosts that crouded to the Shore? Anchises then: Those Souls, to whom by Fate New Bodies are decreed, at Lethe's Stream Drink long Oblivion from the drowsy Waves. All These indeed, my Son, I have desir'd To shew thee, and recount my future Race; That with the more Delight thou may'st enjoy Thy Kingdom fix'd at length on Latium's Coasts. O Father, Is it then to be conceiv'd That any of These Spirits so sublime Would go to upper Light, and re-assume Their sluggish Bodies? Whence such fond Desire, Such miserable Love of wretched Life? Yes; All, my Son, to thee I will explain, Nor hold thee longer in suspense; replies Anchises, and in order all unfolds. First, Heav'n, and Earth, and Ocean's liquid Plains, The Moon's bright Globe, the Sun, and shining Stars, A Soul within enlivens; and a Mind, Diffus'd thro' all its parts, the gen'ral Mass Invigorates, and mingles with the Whole. Hence Men, and Beasts, and all the Feather'd Kind Proceed, and Monsters of the boundless Deep: A fiery Force, and Origin Divine These Seeds inspires; so far as not controul'd By their terrestrial Bodies, clog'd and damp'd By their dull Flesh, and cumbrous mortal Frame. Hence they Desire, and Fear, Rejoice, and Grieve; Nor see the Light, in Prison dark confin'd. Nor, ev'n when Life is fled, do all their Ills, And all their Pests corporeal wear away; But many Stains, in such a Length of Time Contracted, marvellously must inhere. Therefore with Punishment they are explor'd, And pay due Penance for their former Crimes. Some hang expanded to the empty Winds; The Guilt ingrain'd of Others in th'Abyss Of Seas is wash'd; or burnt away with Fire. Each of us from our sev'ral Manes bear Purgation; To Elysium then we go, And here We few enjoy These blissful Fields: When Tract of Time (it's fatal Round at length Revolv'd) has quite work'd off the blended Stain; Leaving defecated th'ethereal Ray, And simple Energy of heav'nly Fire. All These (the Circle of a thousand Years Complete) the God to Lethe's River calls Assembled; that forgetful of the past They may return to Life, and reascend Contended to their first imbody'd State. Thus having spoke, Anchises leads his Son, With his Prophetic Guide, into the Midst Of the thick Concourse, and the sounding Croud; Then takes a Hill, from whence they might discern Their Looks, in long Procession as they came Advancing opposite. Now mark, my Son, The Glory which attends the Dardan Race, What Heroes from th'Italian Stem shall spring, Illustrious future Partners of our Fame, I will explain; and teach thee all thy Fate. Him seest thou leaning on his pointless Spear? That Youth is destin'd next to upper Life; He mingled with Italian Blood shall rise First to ethereal Light; an Alban Name, Sylvius, thy Son by posthumous Descent: Whom late to Thee advanc'd among the Gods Thy Wife Lavinia in the Woods shall bear, Himself a King, and Ancestor of Kings: From whom our Race shall o'er long Alba reign. The next, the Glory of the Trojan Line, Is Procas; Capys; Numitor; and He Who in his own shall represent Thy Name, Sylvius Æneas, equally renown'd In Piety, and Arms; if e'er he come To govern Alba with imperial Sway. See what brave Youths! What manly Force they shew! But They, whose Heads with Civic Oak are wreath'd, Nomentum, Gabii, and Fidena's Walls Shall build on Mountains, and Collatia's Tow'rs, Pometia, and the Fort of Inuus, Bola, and Cora: Those shall be their Names In after Ages; Now no Names they bear. Next, to assert his Grandsire's Right, shall come Mavortian Romulus, to be disclos'd By Ilia, from Assaracus deriv'd: Seest thou upon his Helm the double Crest Stand high? and how the Father of the Gods Ev'n now encircles him with Rays Divine? By his auspicious Conduct, see, my Son, Immortal Rome shall equal to the Earth Her Sov'reign Rule, her Courage to the Sky; And single with her Walls sev'n Hills inclose: With a long Progeny of Heroes bless'd. As Berencynthia in her Chariot rides Aloft, thro' Phrygian Cities, crown'd with Towers; Mother of Gods; proud of her hundred Sons, All Pow'rs Divine, all high enthron'd in Heav'n. Hither, bend hither both thy Eyes; Behold This Lineage, and Thy Romans: Cæsar hence, And all Iülus' Progeny shall come Beneath the spacious Axis of the Sky. This, This is He; the Man whom thou hast heard So often promis'd; Offspring of the Gods, Augustus Cæsar: Destin'd to restore The Golden Age in Latium, govern'd once By Saturn: He his Empire shall extend Beyond the Garamantes, and the Tract Of Indian Regions, Realms beyond the Stars, Beyond the Circuit of the Year, and Sun; Where mighty Atlas on his Shoulders turns The rolling Axis, studded o'er with Stars. On his Approach, ev'n Now the Caspian Realms With Horrour hear the Answers of the Gods; And all the Country of Mœtis' Lake, And Nilus trembles thro' his sev'nfold Stream. Nor did Alcides' self so far advance; Tho' he transfix'd the brazen-footed Deer, Quell'd Erymanthus' Woods, and with his Bow Made Lerna tremble: Nor the Victor God Liber, who guides his Car with viny Reins, And drives his Tygers from high Nisa's Top. And doubt we still our Glory to extend By Actions? Or does Fear forbid us still To fix our Colony on Latium's Coast? But Who is He, with Olive-Boughs from far Conspicuous, and with Incense in his Hands? I know the Roman King, his silver Beard, And venerable Hair. He first by Laws The City shall establish, from the State Of little Cures, and his poor Domains Sent to wide Empire. Him shall next succeed Tullus, who shall dissolve his Country's Peace, Rousing the restive Soldiery to Arms, And Troops unus'd to Triumphs. Ancus Then Shall follow, more magnificently great, Ev'n now too much delighted with the Breath Of popular Applauses. Wouldst thou next Behold the Tarquin Kings? the haughty Soul Of vengeful Brutus? and the Fasces chang'd? He first shall exercise the Consul's Pow'r, And unrelenting Axes; and his Sons Conspiring in new Wars the Father's self To Death for glorious Liberty shall call, Unfortunate: However future Times That Action may resent; his Country's Love Shall conquer, and th'immense Desire of Praise. The Decii at a distance next behold; The Drusi; and Torquatus with his Axe Relentless; and Camillus bringing back The Roman Standard. But Those friendly Souls Thou seest, who now alike in Armour shine, Here in This nether World: What Wars (alas!) Whenever They arrive at upper Light, What Battles, what a Slaughter shall They raise! From Alpine Ridges, and Monæcus' Mount The Father comes, descending: From the East The Son advances opposite in Arms. Forbear such Wars, my Children, O forbear; Nor sheath your dreaded Country's conqu'ring Swords Within your Country's Bowels: And Thou first, My Son, whose Birth is from the Gods deriv'd, Throw Thou thy Arms away. One to the lofty Capitol shall ride High in his Chariot, with Corinthian Spoils Proud, and Triumphant o'er the vanquish'd Greeks. Another, Argos, and Mycenæ fam'd For Agamemnon's Empire, and the great Æacides, from brave Achilles sprung, Shall conquer; to revenge the ancient Kings Of Troy, and Pallas' violated Fane. Thee, mighty Cato, and Thee, Cossus, who Can pass in silence? Who the Gracchian Race? Or the two Scipio's, Thunderbolts of War, The Bane of Lybia? Or Fabricius, great In little Fortune? Or thy Furrows sown, Serranus? Whither weary am I rapt By You, ye Fabii? Thou, the Great, art He Alone, who by Delay retriev'st our State. Others more soft shall carve the breathing Brass; Nay living Looks, I think, from Marble draw: Plead Causes better; with a Wand describe The heav'nly Roads, and trace the rising Stars. Roman, Remember Thou to rule the World; (Be These thy Arts!) to fix the Laws of Peace; To spare the Suppliant, and confound the Proud. So spake Anchises to his wond'ring Guests; Then Thus proceeds: Behold how rich with Spoils Marcellus walks Triumphant, and o'erlooks The Heroes all. He in tumultuous Times, Warriour, shall fix the Roman State; subdue The Carthaginians, and the Rebel Gaul; And the third Trophies to Quirinus bring. Then here Æneas (for with Him he saw A Youth of beauteous Form, in shining Arms, But with o'er-clouded Brow, and down-cast Eyes) Say, Father, Who is He, with such a Mien Attending on the Hero, as he walks? His Son? Or any of th'illustrious Line? What Noise of his Retinue crouding round! How great Resemblance in his Face appears! But gloomy Night with Darkness wraps his Head. Then Thus Anchises, with o'erflowing Tears: Forbear the sad Enquiry, O my Son; Seek not to know th'unutterable Grief Of thy Descendants. Him the Fates shall shew To Earth, and only shew him; nor shall There Permit his longer Stay. Too much, Ye Gods, The Roman Pow'r would seem to rival Yours; Should Gifts like these be lasting! What Laments Shall Mars's Field, near the high Walls, repeat! And what a Fun'ral, Tyber, shalt Thou see, When by his recent Tomb thy Stream shall glide! Nor e'er shall any Youth of Trojan Race Exalt the Latin Fathers in their Hopes So high; nor ever shall Quirinus' Realm Glory so much in any of her Sons. O Piety! O ancient Faith! And Force Invincible in War! Him none adverse Would with Impunity have met in Arms; Whether on foot he had defy'd the Foe, Or with sharp Rowels goar'd the foaming Steed. Alas, lamented Youth! If any way Thou break the Doom of unrelenting Fate; Marcellus Thou shalt be. Bring Lillies here In copious Handfuls: To my Grandson's Shade I'll scatter purple Flow'rs; and pay at least This unavailing Duty. Thus at large, Thro' all the Region, in th'extended Fields Of Air, they walk; and ev'ry thing survey. All which Anchises having shewn his Son, And fir'd his Breast with Love of future Fame; The destin'd Wars in which he must engage He next foretels him; the Laurentian Realms; And King Latinus' City; and the Means, To suffer, or escape his ev'ry Toil. Two Gates of Sleep there are: The one of Horn, Thro' which with ease the real Fantoms pass; With polish'd Elephant the other shines, Thro' which the Manes send false Dreams to Light. Here then the Sire Anchises with his Son, And his Prophetick Guide, in such Discourse Confers; and sends them thro' the Iv'ry Gate. Æneas to his Navy strait pursues His Way, and speedily rejoins his Friends: Then to Cajeta's Harbour sails direct, Coasting along: The Anchors from the Prow Are cast; The Sterns stand resting on the Shore. The End of the Second Volume. VOL. III. [BOOK the Seventh.] Thou too, Cajeta; great Æneas' Nurse, Illustrious Matron, dying on our Coasts, Did'st give them everlasting Fame: And Now The Place thy honour'd Memory preserves; And still thy Name on wide Hesperia's Shores (If That be any Glory) marks thy Dust. But good Æneas, having duly paid The Fun'ral-Rites, and rais'd a Tomb in Air, Soon as the Deep lay smooth, with Canvas spred Unmoors, and leaves the Port. A Breeze at Night Springs fresh; Nor does the silver Moon deny Her Beams, which tremble on the glim'ring Waves. Next, cruising, close by Circe's Shores they sail; Where She, the wealthy Daughter of the Sun, With ceaseless Singing makes the Groves resound, Groves inaccessible; and in the Rooms Of her proud Palace, for nocturnal Light, Sweet Cedar burns: While thro' the slender Web Her whistling Shuttle flies along the Loom. Hence Groans are heard; The Noise of Lions, fierce, Rebellious to their Chains, and roaring loud In Dead of Night; The Grunt of bristly Boars; The Rage of Bears reluctant in their Stalls; And huge portentous Forms of howling Wolves. All which, with pow'rful Charms, from human Shapes The cruel Goddess Circe had transform'd To savage Beasts. And lest the pious Race Of Troy should such a monstrous Change endure, Or wafted touch upon the direful Coast; Neptune with Winds propitious swell'd their Sails, And sped them safe beyond the boiling Tides. And now the Ocean redden'd with the Rays; And in her rosy Car the blushing Morn Shone from the Sky: When all at once the Winds Lay hush'd, and ev'ry Blast; The lab'ring Oars Cleave the smooth Marble of the yielding Deep. Then here Æneas from the Ocean spies A spacious Wood; Thro' which the pleasant Stream Of gulphy Tyber rolls his yellow Sand, And disembogues his Waves into the Sea. Here various Birds, accustom'd to the Banks And Chanel of the River, all around, And all above, with sweet melodious Songs Soften'd the Air, and flutter'd in the Grove. He gives the Crew Command to make the Shore, And joyful on the shady River glides. Now Erato, Celestial Muse, what Kings, What Juncture of Affairs, and what the State Of ancient Latium, when the Fleet of Troy, First touch'd th'Ausonian Coast, I will disclose, Ev'n from it's first Original revolve, And open all the War. Thou, Goddess, Thou Instruct thy Poet: Horrid Wars I sing, Battles, and Princes bent on mutual Death, The Tyrrhene Bands, and all Hesperia rous'd In Arms: A greater Series of Affairs Here rises to my View; A greater Work I meditate. The King Latinus, now Advanc'd in Age, the Towns and Country rul'd In long and pleasing Peace: (Him Fame transmits Of Faunus and the Nymph Marica born, Laurentian Nymph; Faunus from Picus sprung, And He from Saturn, Author of the Race.) To Him no Son, no Offspring Male remain'd, By Fate; but all in Spring of early Youth Were snatch'd away. To heir the State, surviv'd One only Daughter, in her ripen'd Years Full blooming, and mature for Nuptial Joy. Her various Princes sought thro' Latian Realms, And wide Ausonia: More than all the rest, Turnus of graceful Form, and Royal Birth, In Ancestry illustrious; Whom the Queen Hasted, with passionate Desire, to join In That Alliance: But the Oracles Of Heav'n with various Prodigies oppose. Just in the Centre of the most retir'd And secret Court an holy Laurel stood, For many Years religiously preserv'd: Which found, when first He built the stately Tow'rs, Latinus' self, as ancient Fame relates, To Phœbus consecrated; and from thence To the Laurentian People gave their Name. Here Bees, thick flying thro' the liquid Air, With humming Noise (Surprizing to relate!) Beset it's Top, and with their mutual Feet Connected, on the leafy Branches hung, A sudden Swarm. Immediately the Sage Prophetick cries, A foreign Prince we see From the same Quarter on These Coasts arrive, And Sov'reign in the lofty Palace reign. Besides, as chaste Lavinia, Royal Maid, Stood by her Father, and with holy Brands Kindled the Altars; with her flowing Hair (Wond'rous!) She seem'd to catch the Flame, and all Her Head-Attire to crackle in the Blaze: Her Regal Tresses, and her Crown, enrich'd With Gems, involv'd in ruddy Vapour glar'd, And all the Palace round diffus'd the Fire. That Omen of a strange and dire Portent Was rumour'd; For 'twas said, that She her self By Fate in Glory should illustrious rise, But to the People menac'd dreadful War. But, anxious at These Prodigies, the King Repairs to Faunus' Oracle, his Sire Skill'd in the Future; and consults the Groves Beneath Albunea's Height, supreme of Woods; Thro' whose thick Shades a sacred Fountain sounds, And sulph'rous stenchy Exhalations breathes. Hence all th'Italian and Oenotrian Realms In Doubts seek Answers: Hither when the Priest Has brought his Off'rings, and in silent Night Sleeps on spred Skins of fleecy Victims slain; Unnumber'd Fantoms flutt'ring round he sees In wond'rous Forms, and various Voices hears, Enjoys the Conversation of the Gods, And speaks to Acheron in Hell below. Here then Latinus' self, the Oracles Consulting, by the Rite accustom'd, slew An hundred woolly Sheep; and on their Skins And Fleeces, underneath him spred, repos'd His Limbs: When sudden from the deepest Grove This Voice was heard. Attempt not, O my Son, To match thy Daughter with a Latian Lord; Nor trust the Hymenéals now design'd. A foreign Son-in-law shall come, whose Race Shall raise our Name to Heav'n; And future Times Shall see All turn'd and govern'd by Their Sway, Where Sol, both Oceans viewing, rolls his Course. This Answer, by his Father, Faunus giv'n In silent Night, Latinus in his Breast Conceal'd not; But already thro' the Towns Of wide Ausonia flying Fame around Had blaz'd the Rumour: When the Trojan Youth, Under the Covert of a graffy Bank, Had moor'd thier Fleet. Æneas, and the Chiefs, And beautiful Iülus, lie repos'd Beneath the Branches of a lofty Oak; Prepare their Meal, upon the verdant Turf. Lay wheaten Cakes, (so Jove himself advis'd) And on them Heaps of Woodland Fruitage pile. Here, having all their other Food consum'd, When, forc'd by Penury and short Repast, By chance their hungry Appetites they turn'd To slender Viands, and with Hands and Teeth Dar'd violate the fatal Crust's flat Orb, Nor spar'd their Trenchers; See, Iülus cry'd, Our Plates themselves, our Dishes we devour: Not more alluding. First to all their Toils That Speech a Period shew'd; His Father first Snatch'd from his Mouth the Word, and in his Mind With deep Surprize the Oracle revolv'd. Then thus: Hail! Nation due to me by Fate, And You, all hail! Ye faithful Gods of Troy: This is our Country, This our fix'd Abode. For (now I recollect) This secret Scheme Of Destiny my Sire Anchises left: When thee, my Son, at Shores unknown arriv'd, Hunger shall force, thro' Scarcity of Food, To eat thy Dishes; There fatigu'd expect A settled Mansion: And remember There To lay the first Foundation of thy Walls. This was That Hunger he foretold; This last Ordain'd to end our Labours. Then cheerful, with the Sun's first rising Light, Let us explore, what Country This, and who Th'Inhabitants, and where it's Cities stand; And from the Harbour diff'rent ways pursue. Now from your Bowls to Jove Libations pour; My Sire Anchises with religious Pray'rs Invoke; and on your Boards replace the Wine. This said, He binds his Temples with a Wreath Of verdant Boughs; and supplicant adores The Genius of the Place, and Earth, the first Of Deities, the Nymphs, and River-Gods As yet unknown, and Night, and of the Night The rising Starry Signs; in order next The Phrygian Mother, and Idæan Jove, And both his Parents, one rever'd in Heav'n, And one in Erebus. Then thrice serene Th'Almighty Father thunder'd from the Sky, And shook a Cloud, with Rays of Light, and Gold Effulgent: Sudden thro' the Trojan Troops. The Rumour ran, that now the Day was come, In which their destin'd City's Walls should rise. With cheerful Speed industrious they recruit: Their Feasts; and, in th'important Augury Rejoicing, place their Bowls, and crown the Wine. Soon as the first returning Morn had ris'n Upon the World: They diversely explore The Coasts, the Cities, and the Country's Bounds: Here flows Numicus' Fount; there Tyber's Stream; And here the warlike Latins fix their Seat. Then Prince Æneas sends from ev'ry Rank An hundred chos'n Ambassadours, dispatch'd To the Imperial Walls, with Olive-Boughs All wreath'd, to bear his Presents to the King, And sue for Peace: They execute their Charge With rapid Haste. Himself describes the Walls With a low Trench; the first Foundation lays; And, like a Fort, his City on the Shore With Banks and Battlements incloses round. And now, their destin'd Journey having pass'd, Th'Ambassadours beheld the Latin Tow'rs, And lofty Palaces, and reach'd the Walls. Before the City, Boys, and blooming Youth With rapid Chariots exercise their Strength, And tame their Horses in the dusty Field; Or bend their twanging Bows, and with strong Arms Launch the tough Jav'lin; with the Dart, and Shaft, Contending. To the aged Monarch's Ears Swift on his Steed a Messenger relates, That Men of awful Port, in foreign Garb, Were moving tow'rds the Walls: He gives Command To call them to the Court, and in the Midst Sits lofty on th'hereditary Throne. A spacious Palace, in the City's height, Sublime upon an hundred Pillars stood, With gloomy Groves religiously obscure, Laurentian Picus' Palace; Where the Kings The first Inauguration of their Sway, The Sceptres, and the Regal Fasces took: This Court their Temple; Here the sacred Feasts; And here the Fathers, by th'accustom'd Rite, Killing a Victim Ram, in order sate Along the Boards. Before the stately Doors Th'Effigies of their Ancestors stood rang'd In Rows of antique Cedar; Italus, Father Sabinus, Planter of the Vine, Holding in Imag'ry his crooked Scythe, And aged Saturn, and the double Front Of Janus; and the other ancient Kings, Who for their Country suffer'd Wounds in War. Besides; Thick Arms upon the sacred Posts, Curve Scymitars, and captive Chariots hung: And Crests of Helmets; massy Bars of Gates; And Darts, and Shields, and Beaks from Vessels torn. Picus himself, with his Quirinal Wand, Sate in his narrow Trabeal Robe succinct, Tamer of Steeds, and in his Left-hand bore Th'Ancilian Shield: Whom Circe, stung with Love, Struck with her golden Rod, and with her Charms And magic Simples to a Bird transform'd, And all with Colours interspers'd his Wings. In such a Temple of the Gods, enthron'd On his paternal Seat, Latinus calls The Trojans to his Presence in the Court; And Thus with pleasing Accent first began. Tell us, Ye Trojans, (For your Name and Race Are not to us unknown, nor come you here Unheard of;) Say, what seek you? Or what Cause Has urg'd your Navy to th'Ausonian Shore Thro' such a Space of Ocean? Whether driv'n By Errour of the Way, or Stress of Storms, (Variety of Perils on the Deep, Obvious to Mariners) you enter here Our River's Mouth, and rest within the Port: Fly not our Hospitality; nor judge Erroneous of the Latins, Saturn's Race, Just of themselves without Restraint, or Laws, And by th'Example of their ancient God. Nay I remember (tho' long Tract of Time Obscures the Fame) th'Auruncan Sires relate, That Dardanus, from These Dominions sprung, Pierc'd into Phrygia, and th'Idæan Realms, And Thracian Samos, Samothracia now: He now, from Coritus' Tyrrhenian Seat, Admitted to the starry Court of Heav'n, With Altars, in the golden Palace high Enthron'd, augments the Number of the Gods. He spoke: And Thus Ilioneus reply'd. O King, from Faunus' Blood illustrious sprung; Neither by stormy Billows hither toss'd, Nor by the Stars, or Shores unknown, deceiv'd, Arrive we on your Confines: With Design, And willing Minds This City we approach; Ejected from Those Realms, which once the Sun, Rolling from Heav'n's extremest Verge, beheld The greatest. Jove begins our Lineage; Jove The Dardans boast, the Author of their Race. Our Prince himself, from Jove's high Blood deriv'd, Trojan Æneas, sends us to your Court. How great a Tempest swept th'Idæan Fields, Issuing from dire Mycenæ; with what Fates Both Worlds of Europe and of Asia join'd In Battle, Those have heard (if such there be) Whom the most distant Limits of the Globe Sever by Tides; And Those (if such there be) Who live divided by the middle Zone, Stretch'd between four, beneath Sol's burning Car. Toss'd from That Deluge, thro' so vast a Tract Of Ocean, for our Country-Gods we ask A little Mansion, and a safe Retreat, And Air, and Water, common Gifts to all. On your Dominions nothing of Disgrace Shall we reflect; Nor small will be your Fame; Nor shall by length of Time the grateful Sense Of such an Obligation be effac'd: Nor shall th'Ausonian Nation e'er repent To have receiv'd the Trojans. By the Fates Of great Æneas, and his potent Hand, Experienc'd long in Faith, in War and Arms, I swear, that many People, many States, (Despise us not, because we suppliant come, Spontaneous, and with Wreaths of proffer'd Peace) Have courted our Alliance, and desir'd By Partnership to join us with their Realms. But by their dread Commands the Fates Divine Urg'd us to seek Your Coasts: Hence Dardanus Deriv'd his Race, and hither he returns: And great Apollo, from his awful Fane, To Tyrrhene Tyber, and Numicus' Fount, The consecrated Spring, directs our Course. Some Gifts, besides, preserv'd from burning Troy, The little Relicks of his former State, Our Prince presents you. In This Gold his Sire Anchises at the Altars sacrific'd: These, by the Rite accustom'd, giving Laws To the assembled Nations, Priam wore; This Sceptre, This Tiara, and These Robes, The Labour of the Trojan Dames. So spake Ilioneus. Latinus fix'd Sits in one Posture, musing, on the Ground Rolling his Eyes intent: Nor does so much The Priameian Sceptre, nor the Robes Of broider'd Purple move his Kingly Mind: More on his Daughter's Nuptials he employs His deepest Meditation; and revolves Old Faunus' Oracle within his Breast: That This was He, the Son-in-law, design'd By Fate, arriving from a foreign Coast, And Partner of his Throne; That hence a Race Renown'd for Valour, should in Time proceed, And o'er the Universe extend it's Sway. At length with Joy he speaks: The Gods succeed Our Enterprise, and ratify the Fates Themselves predicted: Trojan, what Thou ask'st Is granted: Nor your Gifts do I refuse: While King Latinus reigns, you shall not want The fertil Glebe, and Opulence of Troy. Let ev'n Æneas (if he so desires Our Friendship, and Alliance) hither come, Nor shun the Interview: To me 'twill prove A Pledge of Peace, to touch That Monarch's Hand. You to your King This Answer now return. I have a Daughter, whom our Country Gods And various Prodigys from Heav'n forbid With any of our Nation to be join'd In Nuptial Bonds; and warn us, it remains For Latium, that a Son-in-law shall come From foreign Parts, whose Race shall raise our Name To Heav'n: That He is destin'd, I believe, And (if my Thoughts divine aright) desire. Thus having spoke, the aged King selects From all his Number chosen Steeds: There stood Three hundred shining in their lofty Stalls: To all the Trojans he commands to lead The wingy-footed Coursers, cover'd o'er With rich embroider'd Crimson: Down their Breasts Hang Golden Collars; And adorn'd with Gold They champ the yellow Gold between their Teeth. Next to the absent Trojan Prince he sends A Chariot, and it's harness'd Pair, of Breed Celestial, from their Nostrils snorting Fire: The Race of Those, which wily Circe rais'd, Stol'n from her Father by clandestine Arts, And of a substituted Female bred. Thus with the Gifts and Speeches of the King, Th'Æneadæ, high on their stately Steeds, Return exulting, and report the Peace. But lo! th'inexorable Wife of Jove Comes from Inachian Argos, born in Air Sublime; and from the Sky at distance sees Joyful Æneas, and the Trojan Fleet, From high Pachynus, on Sicilia's Coast. She sees them now intent on Building, sees The Crew in Land confiding, and their Ships Abandon'd: Fix'd she stood with stinging Rage; Then shook her Head, and Thus indignant spoke. Ah Race detested! and the Fates of Troy Oppos'd to mine! Could ev'n the Conquer'd fall In Phrygian Fields? Could ev'n th'Enslav'd be Slaves? And Troy consum'd in Flames the Trojans burn? They thro' the middle of the Foes, and Fires Have found their Way: My Deity at last, It seems, lies vanquish'd; Or with glutted Hate I now desist. Ev'n when expell'd they fled Their native Soil, Vindictive I presum'd To follow them; and to the exil'd Crew O'er all the Ocean's Waves my self oppos'd. Exhausted is the Force of Sea, and Sky, Against the Trojans: What to me avail'd The Syrtes, Scylla, or Charybdis' Gulf? In Tyber's wish'd-for Chanel they are lodg'd, Secure of Storms, and Me. Mars could destroy The mighty Lapithéan Race; Ev'n Jove Himself, to gratify Diana's Rage, Old Calydon abandon'd: By what Crime So terrible a Punishment did either The Lapithæ, or Calydon deserve? But I, Jove's Royal Consort, who could leave Nought unattempted, but all Measures try'd, Unhappy, by Æneas am subdu'd. But if my Deity be not it self. Sufficient; Sure I should not doubt to seek Whatever Aid can be implor'd: If Heav'n I cannot move, I will sollicit Hell. Admit, 'twill not be granted me to bar The Latian Kingdoms; And, by Fates unmov'd, Lavinia still remains the destin'd Bride. Yet we may add Obstructions, and retard Th'important Issue; Yet a wastful War The Subjects of both Monarchs may destroy. Thus at their People's Cost let both the Kings, The Father, and the Son, unite their Realms. Princess, Thy Dowry shall be paid in Blood, By Trojans, and Rutulians; And prepar'd Bellona waits to make thy bridal Bed. Nor did Cisséan Hecuba alone Teem with a Nuptial Taper; Venus too, It will be prov'd, has such a Birth disclos'd; She has her Paris, and connubial Flames Again pernicious to new-rising Troy. Thus having said, She speeds her horrid Flight To Earth; and from the Furies' black Abodes, And Shades Nocturnal, dire Alecto calls; Whose only Pleasure is in joyless War, And Rage, and Treachery, and noxious Crimes. Ev'n Pluto, and th'Infernal Sisters hate The odious Monster; To so many Shapes She turns herself, such hideous Forms assumes, And sprouts with such Variety of Snakes. To whom Thus Juno, irritating, spoke. This Labour, Virgin, Off-spring of the Night, Indulge to me; This Task for me perform; To save my sinking Honour, and forbid Th'Æneadæ by Nuptials to amuse The Latian King, or seize th'Italian Coasts. Thou canst agreeing Brothers rouse to War, Engender Hate in Familys, and toss Within their Walls thy Whips, and fun'ral Brands: Thou hast a thousand Forms, a thousand Arts Of Mischief: Ransack all thy fertil Breast; Confound their Measures of concerted Peace; Sow deep the Seeds of Discord: Let the Youth At once desire, demand, and snatch their Arms. Infected with Gorgonian pois'nous Blood, The Fiend to Latium, and the lofty Walls Of King Latinus, swift directs her Flight; And silent at the Queen's Apartment waits: Whom, on th'Arrival of the Trojan Fleet, And Turnus' Nuptials, anxious female Cares, And Passions boiling, discompos'd. To Her The Fury from her griesly Tresses flings One of her Snakes, and to her inmost Breast Dispatches him; That, by the Monster urg'd To Madness, all the Court she might embroil. The bloated Serpent, sliding 'twixt her Robes, And smooth sleek Bosom, rolls without a Touch, And, unperceiv'd, his vip'rous Breath inspires: Hangs, as a Chain of Gold, about her Neck; As a long twining Fillet, interweaves Her Hair; and slipp'ry wanders o'er her Limbs. While the first Plague, beneath the pois'nous Juice Sliding, invades her Senses, and with Fire Her Vitals blends; nor has as yet the Flame Seiz'd all her Soul: More softly she complains, And with a Mother's wonted Fondness speaks; Much weeping for her Daughter, and the Scheme Of Phrygian Nuptials. Is Lavinia then, Great Monarch, to the Fugitives of Troy Yielded a Captive? In your Breast remains No Pity for your Daughter, nor Your self? None for her Mother? Whom the Pirate false, Perfidious, with the first fair Wind will leave, Launching to Sea, and with him bear away The Virgin? Did not so the Phrygian Swain Pierce into Lacedæmon, and transport Ledæan Helen to the Trojan Tow'rs? What is your sacred Faith, your ancient Care For your own Subjects, and your Hand so oft Plighted to Turnus, Partner of your Blood? If from a foreign Race the Latins seek A Son-in-law; And so you still resolve; And if your Father Faunus awes your Mind By his Commands: All Lands disjoin'd from Ours, And from our Sceptres free, in my Account Are foreign deem'd; And so the Gods intend. And Turnus, if his Pedigree be trac'd To it's first Fountain, from Acrisius springs, From Inachus, and from Mycenæ's Realms. When King Latinus Thus in vain explor'd Against her Purpose resolute she saw; And to her inmost Blood the Snaky Plague Had spred it self, and all her Soul possess'd: Then stung, unhappy, by the Monsters dire, O'er the vast City, with unbounded Rage, She roves distracted. Like a whirling Top, Urg'd by the twisted Thong, which Boys, intent Upon their Sport, the empty Cloysters round, In a wide Circuit exercise: The Wood, Driv'n by the Scourge, in spiral Eddys flys; The stripling Throng in Ignorance admires The spinning Box; The Lashes give it Life. Acted with such Rapidity she runs Thro' the mid Citys, and the madding Crouds. Ev'n, on pretended Bacchanalian Rites, A greater Mischief, with more frantick Rage, Attempting, to the Woods she flys; and There Her Daughter in the shady Mountains hides: To cheat the Trojans of the destin'd Spouse, And disappoint the Nuptials. Loud she crys, Evoë! Bacchus! Who alone deserv'st The Virgin Bride; For Thee (so Fame reports) The Female Train the soft Vine-Jav'lins wield, Thee they surround, their consecrated Locks For Thee they nourish. All the Matrons fir'd, With the same Furies in their Breasts, to seek New Dwellings, leave their Houses; To the Winds They give their Necks, and Hair: Some fill the Sky With trembling Yells; and, clad in Skins of Beasts, Brandish their Spears with Viny Wreaths entwin'd. Her self inflam'd, and waving in the Midst A blazing Pine, the Hymenéal sings For Turnus, and her Daughter; rolling round Her sanguine Eyes: And with a sudden Howl, Iö, Ye Latin Matrons, loud she shrieks; Hear me, where'er you are: If aught remains Within your pious Breasts of Care and Love For lost Amata; if a Mother's Right Can move you; Loose the Fillets of your Hair, And celebrate the Orgie-Feasts with Me. Thus in the Woods, and desart Haunts of Beasts, With Bacchus' Rage Alecto goads the Queen, And hurrys her to Madness. When she thought, That Fury, for the first, enough inflam'd; Latinus' Court, and Counsels all embroil'd: Thence the grim Goddess, rais'd on sooty Wings, Strait to the brave Rutulian's Walls repairs; The City built of old (so Fame reports,) By Danaë, (thither driv'n by boistrous Winds,) For her Acrisian Colony: The Place Was by the ancient Fathers Ardua call'd, And Ardea now th'illustrious Name remains. Here, in the lofty Palace, Turnus slept (Such was his Chance) in gloomy Dead of Night: Alecto lays aside her griesly Shape, And Fury's Visage; and her self transforms Into an aged Dame; with Wrinkles ploughs Her wither'd Front; with hoary Hairs assumes A Fillet; and an Olive-Wreath entwines: Chang'd to old Calybe, of Juno's Train, And Priestess of her Temple; and before The Youth, with Words like These, her self presents. Turnus, Wilt thou endure so many Toils In vain to be exhausted? and resign Thy Sceptres to the Colony of Troy? Thy Nuptials, and thy Dowry bought with Blood The King denys thee; And a foreign Prince Is sought for, to succeed, and heir the Realm. Go now, Derided; and thy self expose To Perils which Ingratitude rewards: Go, rout the Tuscan Legions; and in Peace Protect the Latins. Me, while pleasing Sleep Relieves thee, Juno's self, th'Almighty Queen, Commands to thee This Message to relate. Then rise, and cheerful arm the Youth, and lead Their Squadrons thro' the Gates; dislodge the Chiefs Of Troy, now riding in our Tyber's Mouth: And burn their painted Ships: The Pow'rs Divine Command it: Let the King, Latinus' self, If he submit not, or refuse to grant Thy Rights of Nuptials, and the promis'd Bride, Experience Turnus terrible in Arms. To whom the Youth with scornful Air replys, The Prophetess deriding: That their Fleet Within our Tyber's Chanel is arriv'd, Has not (as Thou supposest) 'scap'd my Ears: Imagine not my Soul can be alarm'd With Fears like These: Nor is Heav'n's mighty Queen Of me unmindful. But Thee, O Mother Prophetess, o'ercome With Rust of Age, and impotent of Truth, Vain Cares disquiet; Thou among the Arms Of Kings with causeless Terrours art deceiv'd. 'Tis Thine to tend the Statues of the Gods, And watch their Shrines: Leave War and Peace to Men; To whom the Management of War belongs. Such Words as These inflam'd Alecto's Rage; Him, while he spoke, a sudden Trembling seiz'd O'er all his Limbs; Fix'd stood his haggard Eyes; The Fury hisses with so many Snakes, So dire a Figure opens to his View. Then, fiercely rolling round her fiery Orbs, Him wav'ring, and attempting to reply She back repels, and on her Hair erect Uprears two Serpents, clangs her sounding Whip, And rapid Thus with hideous Accent speaks. Lo! I, who with the Rust of Age o'ercome, And impotent of Truth, among the Arms Of Kings with causeless Terrours am deceiv'd, See! from the Infernal Sisters' Seat I come: War in my Hand, and Death I bear. So saying, to the Youth she hurls a Brand; And Torches smoking with a smould'ring Light Fixes beneath his Breast. With Horrour rous'd He starts from Sleep; O'er all his Body, Sweat Bedews his shudd'ring Limbs: For Arms he raves, Distracted; Arms upon his Bed demands, And o'er the Palace; madding with the Love Of Battels, and the barb'rous Rage of War. As when, with mighty Noise, the sputt'ring Flame Of Wood, surrounds the boiling Cauldron's Sides; The dancing Liquor bubbles with the Heat; It's aqueous Fury roars, and smokes within, Exuberant, and foaming: Nor does now The Water's bounding Tide it self contain; The pitchy Vapour flying mounts in Air. Therefore the Chiefs of all the Youth he sends, The Peace now broken, to Latinus' Court; Wills him to arm, to guard th'Italian Coasts, And from his Territorys drive the Foe: Himself would prove sufficient to engage Both with the Trojan, and the Latin Pow'rs. He said; and to the Gods his Pray'rs preferr'd. With emulation the Rutulians rouse Each other to the War: His beauteous Youth On Some prevails; on Some his Grandsire Kings; On Some his Valour, and his Fame in Arms. While Turnus the Rutulians Thus inspires With Courage: Swift, uprais'd on Stygian Wings, Alecto to the Trojans speeds her Flight; Having with new Sagacity espy'd The Place, where fair Iülus, on the Shore With Toils and Hounds the flying Deer pursu'd. Here the Cocytian Maid with sudden Rage Of keenest Appetite provok'd the Pack, (Tinging their Noses with th'accustom'd Scent,) To hunt a Stag: Which first th'Occasion prov'd Of Woes, and fir'd the Peasantry to Arms. A Stag there was, of comely Shape, and tall With branching Horns: whom ravish'd from his Dam The Sons of Tyrrheus nourish'd, and their Sire Tyrrheus himself, to whom was giv'n the Charge Of all the Royal Herds, and spacious Fields. This Beast, accustom'd to their gentle Rule, Their Sister Silvia with uncommon Care Adorn'd, and with soft Wreaths his Antlers crown'd, And comb'd, and wash'd him in the limpid Stream. He, patient of the Hand, his Master's Board Attended; wander'd in the Woods; at Night, Tho' late, spontaneous to his Home return'd. Him, at a distance straying, in the Chace, The eager Dogs of young Iülus rous'd; As gliding down the Stream by chance he swam, And on the grassy Bank allay'd the Heat. Ascanius' self, inflam'd with Thirst of Praise, Level'd an Arrow from his bended Bow; Nor was the God not present to direct His erring Hand: The Shaft with hissing Sound Driv'n thro' the hollow Flank and Entrails flew. To his lov'd Home the wounded Beast repairs; Bloody, and groaning, enters his known Stall, Like One imploring; and with plaintive Noise Fills all the House. Their Sister Silvia first, Shrieking with loud Laments, her Bosom beats, And calls the sturdy Peasants to her Aid. They (for the Fiend within the silent Woods Lies lurking) at the Summons strait appear: One with a Firebrand, with a knotty Stake Another arm'd; What-e'er they find in Search Rage makes a Weapon. Tyrrheus calls his Clan; As then by chance he riv'd an Oak in Four With Wedges inward forc'd, and puff'd amain, Wielding his Axe, and panting o'er the Blows. Then from her Spying-place the Hellish Pest, A Juncture fit for Mischief having gain'd, Ascends the Stall; and on it's Summit sounds The Rustick Charge, and thro' the crooked Horn Swells her Tartarean Voice: At which the Grove Suddenly trembled; And the Woods profound All thunder'd; Trivia's Lake at distance heard, Velinus' Rivulets, and hoary Nar With sulph'rous Waves: And to their Bosoms press'd The frighted Mothers clasp'd their crying Babes. Swift to the Sound, where'er the Trumpet gave The direful Signal, snatching up their Arms, From ev'ry Part the hardy Peasants run: And, from their open Tents, the Trojan Youth Pour out their Forces to Ascanius' Aid. They form their Ranks; nor now in rustick Fray With knotty Clubs, or sharpen'd Stakes they fight, But with the two-edg'd Steel: And all around Rises a horrid Crop of Swords unsheath'd; Their Arms against the Sun reflected shine, And cast a brazen Light beneath the Clouds. As when the Waves first whiten with the Foam; The Ocean swells it self by just degrees, And lifts it's Billows higher; 'till at last It rises from the Bottom to the Sky. Here fell before the first embattled Line Almo, the eldest Youth of Tyrrheus' Sons, Shot by a sounding Arrow: For the Wound Beneath his Weazon stuck, and with his Blood Clos'd up the Passage of the humid Voice, And choak'd the slender Life. Upon the Field Around him many slain promiscuous lay; And old Galesus, while he interpos'd To offer Peace; Than whom more just was None, Nor wealthier in Ausonian Lands: To Him Five bleating Flocks, as many Herds return'd; And with an hundred Ploughs he till'd the Glebe. While Thus the Fight with equal Fortune hangs; The Goddess, having now perform'd her Charge, Giv'n Death a Taste, and dipp'd the War in Blood, Forsakes Hesperia; and in Air sublime To Juno Thus with Pride and Triumph speaks. See Discord by dire War for you complete; Bid them unite in Amity, and Leagues: Since with Ausonian Gore I have imbru'd The Trojans; if your Will concur with mine, This I will add: I'll rouze the neighb'ring Towns With Rumour's to the Fight, and fire their Minds With mad Desire of Arms; that they may come Auxiliaries: Thro' all the Countries round I'll scatter War. Then Juno thus replies. Abundant are the Terrours, and the Frauds: The Causes of the War stand fix'd; They fight In closest Battle join'd, with Arms which Chance At first supply'd; New Blood has ting'd Those Arms. Let King Latinus, and the precious Son Of Venus celebrate such Marriage-Rites, Such Hymenéals: Thee Heav'n's Lord supreme Permits not longer in th'Ethereal Air To rove licentious: From These Realms retire: Whatever Task, or Fortune yet remains, My self will manage. Thus Saturnia spoke: The Fiend expands her snaky sounding Wings; Seeks black Cocytus' Seat, and leaves the Sky. Full in Italia's Centre, underneath The lofty Hills, there is a Place renown'd By Rumour wide, and fam'd on various Coasts; Amsanctus' Valleys: Which on ev'ry side A gloomy Wood incloses, thick with Trees; And in the Midst a rapid Torrent whirls It's Waves, and tumbling foams among the Stones With roaring Noise. A horrid Cavern here Is shewn: Thro' whose black Tunnels breaths the Stench Of griesly Dis; and burst from Acheron A Gulph opes wide its pestilential Jaws: Thro' which the Fury plung'd her hideous Form Detested, and reliev'd the Earth and Skies. Nor less mean-while Saturnia to the War Adds her last Hand: The Shepherds from the Field Rush to the City, bringing back their Slain, Young Almo, and Galesus' Face besmear'd; Conjure Latinus, and implore the Gods. Them Turnus present joins; and, in the Midst Of Crimes, and Slaughter, aggravates the Guilt, Doubles the Terrour, and inflames their Rage. Alledges, that the Trojans are receiv'd Partners to share the Realm; a Phrygian Race Incorporate; Himself expell'd from Court. Then Those, whose Mothers thro' the pathless Woods, With Bacchanalian Madness dancing, rov'd, (For great the Influence of Amata's Name) Come gather'd from all Parts, and urge the Fight. Against the Fates, and Prodigies Divine, And angry Gods, infatuate they demand The impious War; and obstinately croud With Tumult round the King Latinus' Court. He, like a Rock amidst the Sea, unmov'd, Stands opposite, resisting: Like a Rock Amidst the Sea; Which, while the roaring Tide Encroaches, with it's Weight it self sustains, Among the noisy Waves: In vain the Cliffs Foaming rebellow loud; And all around The broken Sea-weed dashes on it's Sides. But when no Pow'r was left him to o'er-rule Their blind Resolves; And all th'Affair runs smooth By cruel Juno's Nod: The awful Sire, Protesting much, to witness calls the Gods, And empty Air; The Fates, alas! he cry'd, O'erpow'r us; And we drive before the Storm. Your selves, Ye Miserable, with your Blood Shall dearly pay the Forfeit of your Crime. Thee, Turnus, Thee a Penalty severe Awaits; And thou with Pray'rs too late preferr'd Shalt importune the Gods: For Me, my Rest Is found; And in the Port my Vessel rides: An happy Fun'ral-Pomp is all I lose. He said no more; but in his Palace-Walls Confin'd himself, and left the Reins of State. An ancient Rite Hesperian Latium held; Which all the Alban Cities still observ'd As sacred, Now Imperial Rome observes; When first they fire the Martial God to Arms: Whether against the Getæ they provide The Woes of War; or to th'Hyrcanians bend; Or to th'Arabians; and the Indian East; And from the Parthians re-demand their Spoils. Two Gates of War there stand (so call'd their Name) Tremendously religious, by the Dread Of horrid Mars: An hundred brazen Bolts, And everlasting Iron's solid Strength Secures them; Nor does Janus ever cease To guard the Portal. Here, when certain War The Fathers' by their Sentence have decreed; The Consul, clad in his Quirinal Gown, And rich Gabinian Robe, himself unlocks The jarring Doors; Himself calls forth the Fight: Then all the Forces follow; And at once In shrill Assent the brazen Trumpets sound. Latinus then, by This accustom'd Rite, They urge against the Trojans to denounce Defiance, and unbar the fatal Doors. The King, averse, detests their Touch, and flies The odious Ministry; and hides himself In close Retirement. Then the Queen of Gods, From Heav'n descending, with her Hand impels The ling'ring Bolts; and on their crashing Hinge Her self bursts ope the iron Gates of War. Ausonia, peaceful, and unmov'd e'erwhile, Now burns with Fury: Some on foot prepare To take the Field; Some storm in Clouds of Dust, High on their lofty Steeds: All Arms require. Some scour their polish'd Shields, and pointed Spears, And whet their Battle-Axes; pleas'd to wave The Banners, and to hear the Trumpets sound. Five mighty Towns on Anvils rais'd renew Their Arms; Atina potent, Tybur proud, Ardea, and Crustumeria, and with Tow'rs Antemnæ crown'd. They form their solid Cisques; And Sallow Twigs for bossy Targets bend: Some brazen Corslets, or smooth Cuisses beat In ductile Silver: All the due Regard To Tillage, all the Honour of the Plough, And Love of Vintage, hither is transfer'd: The Weapons of their Fathers they recast In Forges: Now the Trumpet's Clangor sounds; The Word is giv'n: One snatches from the Roof His Helm with eager Haste; Another joins His neighing Steeds in Harness, fits his Shield, Laces his triple-tissu'd Coat of Mail, And buckles to his Side his trusty Sword. Now open Helicon, and Songs inspire, Celestial Muses: Say, what Kings were rous'd To Battel; under ev'ry Chief what Troops Crouded the Fields; In Latium's fertil Soil Ev'n Then what Heroes flourish'd; With what Arms It kindled War: For You, Ye Pow'rs Divine, Can best remember, and record; To Us A Breath of scanty Rumour scarce descends. First, stern Mezentius, Scorner of the Gods, To War advances from the Tyrrhene Coasts, And arms his Troops: With Him his Son appears, Lausus, than whom more beautiful was None, Except Laurentian Turnus' graceful Form. Lausus, for Horses tam'd, and Beasts subdu'd Illustrious, from Agylla's City leads In vain his Thousand; worthy to enjoy A better and a happier Sire; and He Unworthy of so good and brave a Son. Next Aventinus, fam'd in War, and born. Of warlike Hercules, upon the Plain His conqu'ring Horses and his Chariot shews, Crown'd with triumphant Palm; and on his Shield His Father's Impress bears, the Hydra, round Inclos'd, and hissing with an hundred Snakes. Him in the Wood of Aventinus' Mount The Priestess Rhea, by a stol'n Embrace A Woman mingling with a God, disclos'd To Light ethereal; when from Geryon slain Tyrinthius Conqu'ror reach'd Laurentum's Fields, And wash'd th'Iberian Herds in Tyber's Stream. Piles in their hands, and goring Pikes they bear, And with round pointed Sabine Jav'lins fight. Himself on foot a Lion's monstrous Hide Throws o'er his Head, and Shoulders, with white Teeth, And shaggy Fur: Thus stalks into the Hall, Horrid, and with Herculean Terrour dress'd. Two Brothers next forsake Tiburtian Walls, Which from their Brother Tiburs took their Name, Brave Coras, and Catillus, Argive Youth; And in the Front, among the thickest Darts, Advance. As when two Cloud-born Centaurs leave With rapid Pace, some airy Mountain's Height, From Omole, or Othrys' snowy Top Descending: To their Steps the Wood gives way, And crashing Trees on either side retire. Nor was the Founder of Præneste's Tow'rs Not present; Cæculus, the King, believ'd, In ev'ry Age, among the rustick Herds Of Vulcan born, and found in Smoke and Fire. With Him a num'rous rustick Legion march'd; The Soldiers who Præneste's lofty Walls Inhabit, and Gabinian Juno's Fields, Cold Anienus, and the Hernic Rocks Water'd with Streams; whom rich Anagnia feeds, And Father Amasenus. These in Arms Appear not all, nor sounding Chariots drive, Nor Targets wear: The greatest part throw Balls Of livid Lead; Part brandish in their Hands Two Darts: A yellow Cap of Wolf-skin made Covers their Heads; Their left Foot bare; Their right In the raw Leather of a Shoe inclos'd. But from Neptunian Blood Messapus sprung, Tamer of Steeds, whom None with Sword, or Fire Could vanquish, suddenly to Battel calls His long unactive Subjects, and his Troops Unus'd to War; and reassumes his Arms. These lead the Forces from Fescennium drawn, And just Faliscum; These possess the Hill And Lake of Ciminus, Capena's Groves, Soracte's Mountains, and Flavinian Fields. In even Lines they march'd, and sung their King: As when the snow-white Swans thro' liquid Air Return from Feeding, and melodious Strains Thro' their long Throats extend; The River sounds; And at a distance Asia's Lake returns Their Warbling. Nor any would have thought That num'rous Force For brazen War assembled; but a Cloud Of airy Birds, which from the gulphy Deep Swift wing'd their way, and singing sought the Shore. Lo! Clausus, from the Sabines' ancient Blood Descended, leads a mighty Host, Himself A mighty Host; from whom the Claudian Tribe And Lineage now thro' Latium is diffus'd, Since Rome in part was to the Sabines giv'n. With Him the Amiternian Cohort wide, The old Quirites, all Eretum's Band, Mutuscæ Olive-bearing; Those who hold Nomentum's Town, Velinus' dewy Fields, Tetrica's rugged Rocks, Severus' Mount, Casperia, Foruli, Himella's Stream; Those who of Fabaris, and Tyber drink; Those whom bleak Nursia sent, th'Hortinian Troops; And Latin Clans; and Those whom (fatal Name!) Allia with intermediate Stream divides. Num'rous, as Surges roll'd on Libya's Sea, When rough Orion sets in wintry Waves; Or Ears of Corn scorch'd by the Summer's Sun, On Hermus' Plain, or Lycia's yellow Fields: Their Targets ring; And with their trampling Feet The Ground beneath them trembles, as they walk. Halesus, born of Agamemnon's Race, Foe to the Trojan Name, his harness'd Steeds Joins to his Chariot; and with rapid Haste His furious Thousand brings to Turnus' Aid: Those who with Harrows turn the Massic Soil Fertil of Wine; and whom th'Auruncan Sires Sent from their lofty Hills; and Those who live Fast by the Sidicinian Seas; and Those Who Cales leave; and near Vulturnus' Ford Inhabit; and the Oscian Band; and rough Saticulans. Round missile Darts they throw; But These by Custom to a pliant Thong Are ty'd: A Buckler on their Left they wear; And crooked Fauchions wield in closer Fight. Nor shalt Thou, Oebalus, be in our Verse Left unrecorded; whom Sebethus' Nymph (So Fame reports) to aged Telon bore, When o'er Teleboan Capreæ's Realms he reign'd. But, with his Father's Limits not content, The Son ev'n Then with more extended Sway Rul'd the Sarrastes, and the Countries wash'd By Sarnus; Those who Batulum possess, And Rufæ, and Celenna's Fields; And Those Whom cloath'd with Trees Abella's Walls command; Accustom'd, by Teutonic Mode, to hurl Huge pond'rous Jav'lins: Rind of Cork their Casques; And brazen Swords they wear, and brazen Shields. Thee too the Nursian Mountains sent to War, Ufens, renown'd by Fame for conqu'ring Arms; Whose Subjects all the Natives round excel'd In Fierceness, harden'd in a harden'd Soil, The savage Æqui; us'd among the Woods To ceaseless Hunting: Arm'd they till the Glebe; And evermore delight to bear away Fresh daily Plunder; and by Rapine live. Next, of Marubian Race the valiant Priest, Sent by the King Archippus, Umbro came; (His Helm with happy Olive-Foliage wreath'd:) Who with his Charms, or Touch, the vip'rous Race, And Dragons, breathing pestilential Stench, Could lull to Sleep, and mollify their Rage, And heal with magick Art the Wounds they gave: But could not cure the Wound Himself receiv'd, Pierc'd by a Dardan Spear; Nor aught avail'd His lulling Charms, nor Herbs on Marsian Hills Collected: Thee Angitia's Wood deplor'd; Thee Fucinus within his crystal Stream; Thee mourn'd the liquid Lakes. There Virbius march'd, illustrious, fam'd in Arms: Whom to Hippolitus Aricia bore, And sent to Battel; in Egeria's Woods Nurs'd up, along the humid Shores; where stands An Altar fat with Blood, and milder now, Rais'd to Diana. For Tradition tells, That when, torn piece-meal by the frighted Steeds, Hippolytus had, by his Step-dame's Art, Glutted his Father's Vengeance with his Blood; He rose again to vital Air, restor'd By med'cinal Simples, and Diana's Love. But Heav'n's high King, with Indignation mov'd That any Mortal from th'infernal Shades Should to the Light of upper Life return, Himself with Thunder to the Stygian Waves Struck the Inventer of That med'cinal Art, Apollo's Son. But in a Seat retir'd Propitious Trivia hid Hippolytus, And to the Nymph Egeria and her Groves Committed him; That in th'Italian Woods, Lonesom, inglorious, he might waste his Days, And by a Change of Name be Virbius call'd. Hence from the Temple and the sacred Groves Of Trivia horny-footed Steeds are driv'n: Because, by Sea-born Monsters scar'd, they flung The Chariot and the Youth upon the Shore. Yet not the less upon the spacious Plain His Son in Harness manag'd fiery Steeds; And with his Chariot rush'd into the War. But, by the Head entire, o'ertopping all, Turnus himself with beauteous Form appears, High in the Van, and graceful shines in Arms. Whose crested Helmet, with a triple Plume Tow'ring, sustains Chimæra, from her Jaws Breathing Ætnean Fires: The more the Fight Kindles in Rage, and rolls with Tides of Blood; The more she storms, and burns with baleful Flames. With Horns erected Iö cast in Gold (Illustrious Argument!) his Buckler grac'd, An Heifer now, and all with Hair o'ergrown; Argus her Watch; and Inachus her Sire, Pouring his River from his graven Urn. A Storm of Foot succeeds; And shielded Troops O'er all the Fields stand thick: The Argive Youth, Th'Auruncan Forces, the Rutulian Bands, The old Sicani, and Sacranian Files, And gay Labici with their painted Shields. Those, Tyberinus, who thy Woods manure, And Those who plough Numicus' sacred Shore; The Ridge of Circe, and Rutulian Hills, The Fields o'er which Anxurian Jove presides, And with her verdant Grove Feronia pleas'd: Where the black Pond of Satura lies deep; And thro' low Vales cold Ufens seeks his Way, And in the Ocean hides his mingled Waves. These of the Volscian Race Camilla joins, Leading her Horse-Brigade, and Troops with Brass Refulgent: Warlike Virgin; in the Loom And Baskets of Minerva (Female Arts!) Unpractis'd; but inur'd to toilsom War, And with her Fleetness to outstrip the Winds. She o'er the Tops of untouch'd Corn would fly, Skimming along, nor hurt the tender Grain; Or run, supported on a swelling Wave, Thro' the mid Sea, nor tinge her nimble Feet. Her all the Youth, from Towns and Countries pour'd, And Crouds of Matrons, with insatiate Gaze, Longing pursue; and eagerly admire How on her smooth sleek Shoulders sits her Vest Of Regal Crimson; how a Buckle strains Her Tresses, and confines them clasp'd in Gold; How graceful She her Lycian Quiver bears, And tip'd with Steel her rural Myrtle Spear. The End of the Seventh Book. BOOK the Eighth. Soon as the Signal of the War, display'd By Turnus, floated on Laurentum's Tow'r; And the shrill Trumpet sounded loud Alarms; Soon as he fir'd the sprightly Steeds, and clash'd The rattling Arms; Forthwith their Minds confus'd With Rage demand the Fight: All Latium leagu'd Trembles with Tumult; and the madding Youth With Fury storms: The Chiefs, Messapus first, And Ufens, and the Scorner of the Gods Mezentius, from all Parts their Succours bring, And leave no Hinds to till the spacious Fields. Then to great Diomede's Imperial Walls, To sue for Succour, Venulus is sent, T'inform him, that the Trojans were arriv'd In Latium; That Æneas with his Fleet Had brought his vanquish'd Gods, himself declar'd The King requir'd by Fate; That many Realms Espous'd the Trojan's Int'rest; and his Name Thro' Latium's Regions was diffus'd around: What was his End by such Attempts propos'd, What Issue of his Battles he desir'd, Should he succeed, to Diomede himself, More plainly than to either of the Kings, To Turnus, or Latinus, must appear. In Latium Thus: All which the Trojan Chief Perceiving, fluctuates with a Tide of Cares; His wav'ring Mind alternately divides A thousand Ways; now This, now That resolves, And turns on ev'ry side his shifting Thoughts. As when in brazen Vats the trembling Light Of Water, from the Sun's reflected Beams, Or from the Image of the radiant Moon, Flits all around, and now is whirl'd aloft To the high Roof, and dances in the Air. 'Twas Night; and ev'ry Creature, Beast, and Bird, O'er all the World, lay hush'd in soft Repose; Whence Prince Æneas, on the Bank reclin'd, Beneath the open Canopy of Heav'n, And troubled in his Breast with Woes of War, Late Rest indulg'd. To Him the local God, Old Tyberinus, from his pleasant Stream, Among the Poplar Boughs, appear'd to rise: Thin azure Linen o'er his Shoulders flew; And shady Reeds entwin'd his hoary Head. Then Thus he spoke, and Thus reliev'd his Cares. O born of Race celestial, chos'n by Fate To bring the Trojans from amidst the Foes To Us restor'd, and eternize thy Troy; O long expected by the Latian Realm; Here is thy Mansion, here thy fix'd Abode. Desist not Thou, nor fear the Threats of War: The high swoln Anger of the Pow'rs Divine Is all abated. And now, for proof that no illusive Dream Deceives thee with a visionary Scene, Thou shalt beneath the Willows on the Shore Find a white Sow, and round her Teats her Young Of the same Colour, lying on the Ground; Thirty in number: That shall be the Place To build thy City; There thy certain Rest From Labours. From That time, in thirty Years, Alba, so call'd from hence, shall rise renown'd Built by Ascanius. Certain are th'Events Which I predict: At present (mark my Words) How what th'immediate Stress of Things requires Thou may'st accomplish, I'll in brief unfold. Th'Arcadians, from the Blood of Pallas sprung, To King Evander and his Banners join'd, Have Here their Mansion chose, and on the Hills Founded their City Pallentéum, nam'd From ancient Pallas. These perpetual War Wage with the Latins: Add Thou to thy own Their Martial Bands, and ratify a League, My self along the Banks, and River, strait Will speed thy Course; that wafted thou may'st pass With Oars the Stream adverse. Rise, Goddess-born, With the first setting Stars make solemn Vows To Juno, and by suppliant Pray'rs o'erpow'r Her Rage and Threats; To Me, when Victor, pay Due Honours: He I am, whom here thou see'st Rolling between the Banks with plenteous Tide, And cutting with my Train the fertil Glebe; Cerulean Tyber; fav'rite Stream of Heav'n: My stately Palace here, in future Times, Empress of Tow'ring Citys shall arise. The River spoke, and plung'd into his Flood: Sleep leaves Æneas; and the Night retires. Rising, he turns him to the rising Sun; And from the River in his hollow Hands, By solemn Rite accustom'd, Water takes, And Thus prefers his Suit in open Air. Ye Nymphs, Laurentian Nymphs, from whom the Birth Of Rivers springs; and Thou, Supreme of Floods, O Father Tyber, with thy sacred Stream; Receive Æneas, and relieve his Toils. Thou, who with Pity do'st regard our Woes; In whate'er Soil thy beauteous Head is rais'd, Where-e'er thy Source: For ever shall by Me Thy Deity be honour'd, Horny God, King of Hesperian Rivers. Only grant To Us thy nearer Succour, I implore, And ratify the Promise thou hast giv'n. He said; And from his Fleet two Gallys chose; New rigg'd them, and supply'd his Friends with Arms. When to their Eyes a Prodigy appear'd Wond'rous, and sudden; In the Wood a Sow Of milk-white Colour, with her milk-white Young, Together lying on the verdant Shore. Them good Æneas to Thy Altar brings, Great Queen of Gods, a Sacrifice to Thee. All That Night long propitious Tyber calm'd His swelling Stream, and refluent still'd his Waves, Smooth as a standing Lake, or glassy Pond; That no Obstruction might retard their Oars. Therefore their destin'd Voyage they pursue, With prosp'rous Omen: Down the River floats The new-pitch'd Fir; The Woods and Waves admire A Sight so unaccustom'd on the Tide, The painted Vessels, and the shining Shields. Lab'ring they ply their Steerage Night and Day; And various Windings pass, thro' various Trees Imbow'ring; and along the gentle Stream Cut the reflected Groves, and verdant Shades. Now in his full Meridian blaz'd the Sun: When at a distance they beheld the Walls, The Fort, and Tops of Houses thinly rang'd; Which Now the Roman Pow'r has rais'd to Heav'n; Evander Then possess'd the poor Domains. They turn their Prows, and soon approach the Town. It chanc'd that on That Day, th'Arcadian King, Before the City, in a Grove's Recess, To great Alcides, and the Gods, perform'd A solemn Sacrifice: At which his Son Pallas assisted, and the chosen Youth, And wealthless Senate: Clouds of Incense rose, And at the Altars smok'd the tepid Blood. When the tall Ships among the shady Woods Gliding they saw, with lab'ring, silent Oars; Scar'd at the sudden Sight all leave the Boards: Bold Pallas wills them not to interrupt The sacred Feast; and, snatching up a Dart, Himself flys obvious: On a rising Ground Then speaks from far. Say, Strangers, for what Cause Explore you Ways unknown? Or whither tends Your Voyage here? Whence come you? From what Race Deriv'd? And bring you hither Peace, or War? Then good Æneas, from the lofty Deck Waving the peaceful Olive in his Hand, Replys: The Trojans you behold, and Arms Hostile to Latium; Trojans thence expel'd By impious War. Evander's Court we seek: To Him this Message bear; To Him relate, That chosen Chiefs are here arriv'd from Troy, To ask his Friendship, and Confed'rate Arms. Struck at so great a Name, young Pallas stood; Approach, he cry'd, whoe'er Thou art; approach My Father's Presence, and with him confer, And to our hospitable Court proceed. He said; embrac'd; and hung upon his Hand: They leave the River, and ascend the Grove. Then Thus the Trojan Chief with friendly Words Bespeaks the King. O Best of Grecian Race, Whom Fortune wills me to address with Pray'r, Extending in my Hand the Olive-Branch With Fillets wreath'd; To Me no Cause of Fear Was your Extraction; tho' Arcadian born; A Grecian Leader, and ally'd in Blood To both th'Atridæ, You their Lineage share. But me my Piety, and Heav'n's Commands, Our Kindred Parents, and your Fame diffus'd Thro' all the World, have urg'd by Fate's Decree, Well pleas'd, to join Our Colony to Yours. Troy's first great Founder, Dardanus, the Son (So Greece relates it) of Electra, sprung From Atlas, on the Trojan Coasts arriv'd. Electra's Birth from mighty Atlas came, Who on his Shoulder turns th'Ethereal Orbs. Your Sire is Mercury; and Him conceiv'd On cold Cyllene's Top fair Maia bore; Maia, the Daughter (if we credit Fame) Of the same Atlas, who sustains the Sky: Thus from one common Stock both Stems divide. Trusting to This, no Embassy I sent, Nor at a distance artfully explor'd Your Counsels; but my self expos'd, and came In my own Person, suppliant to your Court. The same fierce Daunian Race, which You alarms With cruel War, if Us it can expel, Thinks ev'ry Bar remov'd; and to it's Yoke Hesperia all must bend, and all the Sea, Which washes it on either side. Accept, And give alternate Faith: We want not Strength, Nor Courage firm, nor Youth well try'd in War. He said; And, while he spoke, th'Arcadian King Gaz'd stedfast on his Face, and Eyes; and all From head to foot survey'd his Person o'er: Then Thus in brief reply'd. With what Delight, Bravest of Trojans, Thee do I receive, And recognize! How recollect in Thee The Visage and the Accent of thy Sire, The great Anchises! For I well remember, When Priam came to Salamin, where reign'd Hesione his Sister, in his Way He visited Arcadia's frozen Coasts. The first gay Bloom of Youth then flush'd my Cheeks; The Trojan Leaders I admir'd, admir'd Priam Himself: But high above the rest Anchises walk'd; With youthful Fire I burn'd, Longing to greet That Prince, and join our Hands. Him I accosted, and with fond Desire To Pheneum's Walls conducted. Parting thence, A costly Quiver fill'd with Lycian Shafts He gave me, and a Cloak with Threads of Gold All interwoven, and two Bridles rich With bossy Gold; which still my Pallas keeps. Therefore the plighted Faith you ask is giv'n: And when to-morrow's Sun with rising Beams The World illumines; I'll dismiss you safe With my Assistance, and supply'd with Arms. Mean-while, since here in Amity you come, Join You, well pleas'd, to celebrate with Us These annual Rites, which must not be defer'd; And share ev'n Now the Banquet of your Friends. This said, he strait commands them to replace The Meat and Bowls remov'd; and seats his Guests Along a Grassy Bed; above them all, Invites Æneas to his Maple Throne, Upon a Lion's shaggy Hide repos'd. The chosen Youth, industrious, and the Priest Bring roasted Flesh of Bulls, distribute Bread In Baskets pil'd, and minister the Wine. Æneas, and, with Him, the Trojan Youth Feed on a solid Steer's perpetual Chine, And hallow'd Entrails for Lustration fry'd. Soon as the Rage of Hunger was appeas'd; The King Evander spoke. These solemn Rites, This Feast accustom'd, and This Altar rais'd, Brave Trojan Guest, to so renown'd a God, No Superstition, no ungrounded Fear, Nor Ignorance of the ancient Pow'rs Divine On Us impos'd: From direful Perils sav'd, This Sacrifice, in Gratitude, we pay; And Honours justly merited renew. Here first behold That Cliff on craggy Piles Suspended; How the Rubbish scatter'd lies; Yon Cave stands empty in the Mountain's Side, And all in Ruins hang the broken Rocks. Here, in a vast Recess, withdrawn from Sight, A Den there was impervious to the Sun, Inhabited by Cacus, half a Beast, Monster of hideous Aspect: Still the Ground With recent Slaughter smok'd; and human Heads, To his proud Portal fix'd, and smear'd with Gore, Hung pale, and ghastly. Vulcan gave him Birth; Expiring from his Mouth his Father's Flames, With Bulk immense he stalk'd. At length the Course Of Time revolving to our Wishes brought The Presence, and the Succour of a God. For when, from three-form'd Geryon slain, with Spoils Victorious, to our Coasts Alcides came; Hither the great Avenger drove his Herds Of lofty Bulls, and Heifers; which possess'd The Valley, and along the River graz'd. The brutal Robber Cacus, mad in Guilt, That nothing unattempted he might leave Of Villany, or Fraud, four stately Steers As many beauteous Heifers from their Stalls Averts: And lest their Footsteps, in a Track Direct imprinted, should reveal the Theft; He drags them by their Tails into his Cave, Forc'd backwards, with th'Impression of their Feet Revers'd, and hides them in the gloomy Rock. No Traces aid the Hero in his Search, Or guide him to the Den: And now, prepar'd To seek a Change of Pasture, from their Stalls He moves his fodder'd Kine; The lowing Herds, At their Departure, with complaining Noise Fill all the Wood, and bellowing leave the Hills. One of the Heifers in the Grot confin'd Returns the Sound; and, from the spacious Cave Loud roaring, disappoints the Felon's Hope. Alcides' Gall with Vengeance burns; His Arms He snatches, grasps his pond'rous knotty Oak, And, running, gains th'aërial Mountain's Height. Then first our Friends saw Cacus in his Eyes Confessing Fear: He trembling, swift as Wind, And wing'd with Terrour, to his Cavern speeds. When, There inclos'd, he burst the Chains, and o'er His Head let down the massy Rock, which hung Fasten'd with Iron by his Father's Art, And all the Entrance with strong Bars secur'd; Lo! raging with Revenge, Tirynthius came, Exploring ev'ry Passage round he gaz'd, Gnashing his Teeth: Thrice, hot with boiling Ire, All Aventinus' Mountain he survey'd; Thrice at the rocky Portal tugg'd in vain; And Thrice sate down to rest him in the Vale. A sharp high Cliff there stood, on ev'ry side Shatter'd, and rising o'er the Cavern's Back, Apt for the Nests of dire ill-omen'd Birds: This Ridge, as tow'rds the River, on the left, It lean't inclining, He upon the right, Lab'ring with mighty Vigour, push'd adverse, And from the Roots uptore; and all at once Impel'd it: With That Impulse Heav'n resounds, The Banks leap backwards, and the frighted Stream Retreats: The roomy Den, all Cacus' Court, And darksom Caverns to the Sight appear; As if the Earth, by some vast Force convuls'd, Wide yawning should unlock th'infernal Realms, Those pallid Regions, by the Gods abhorr'd, Disclose the fathomless Abyss, and fright The Manes with the rushing Glare of Day. Him, now surpriz'd in unexpected Light, Shut in his hollow Rock, and braying loud With hideous Yell, Alcides from above Presses with Darts, collecting all his Arms, And with huge Trunks, and Mountains' Fragments plies. The Wretch (for now no Hope of Flight remains) Vomits a pitchy Vapour from his Throat, (Wond'rous to tell!) involves the House in Clouds, Blinding the Eyes; and tumbles thro' his Cave Black smoky Night, and Darkness mix'd with Fire. These Arts enrag'd Alcides could not bear; But with a furious Leap into the Flames Flings himself forward, where the wavy Smoke Thro' the vast Den in blackest Volumes rolls. Here Cacus belching useless Fires, in Clouds Of Darkness, with close Grasp into a Knot He cramps; scoops out his Eyes; and with dire Gripe Throttles his Gullet, now undrench'd with Blood. The Doors wrench'd open to the Sight disclose The gloomy Mansion, and the Theft abjur'd, And Cattle forc'd away; And by the Feet The hideous Corps is dragg'd: With wond'ring Gaze They view, insatiate, his half-brutal Form, His dreadful Eyes, his Face, and shaggy Breast, And in his smoking Jaws th'extinguish'd Fire. Since That, due Honours to the God are paid; And by Posterity with holy Mirth This solemn Day observ'd: Potitius first, And the Pinarian Family, which keeps Deposited th'Herculean sacred Rites, Here in the hallow'd Grove This Altar built; Which great thro' Ages ever shall be call'd By Us; And great thro' Ages it shall be. Come on then, gallant Youths; and, to reward Such mighty Merit, bind your Hair with Boughs; Extend your Goblets in your Hands; invoke Our common God; and cheerful crown the Wine. This said; The double-colour'd Poplar veils His Temples with Herculean Shade, and hangs In twining Leaves; A consecrated Bowl Fills his left Hand: All joyous on the Board Pour the Libations, and invoke the Gods. Mean-while the Ev'ning to the Sky convex Rolls near: The Priests, Potitius at their Head, Bear lighted Torches; and, begirt with Skins Accustom'd, in Procession walk, restore The Banquets, bring the Second grateful Cheer, And with fill'd Chargers pile the sacred Hearths. The Salii next, with Poplar Garlands wreath'd, To tuneful Measures round the Altars dance, A youthful This, as That an aged Quire. These sing the Praises, and the God-like Deeds Of Hercules: How first two monstrous Snakes, His Step-dame's Vengeance, in his Hands he crush'd; How Cities he demolish'd fam'd in War, Troy, and Oechalia; how a thousand Toils, Decreed by cruel Juno, he endur'd Under the King Eurystheus: By Thy Hand, Invincible, the Cloud-born Centaurs fell, Huge Pholus, and Hylæus; By Thy Hand, The Prodigy of Crete; And in his Cave Nemea's vast Lion: Thee the Stygian Lake Fled trembling; Thee th'infernal Mastiff, strecth'd On Bones half eaten in his gory Den. No Face of Peril e'er could shake Thy Soul, Not ev'n Typhœus in Gigantic Arms: Thee not deserted of Thy present Mind The Snake at Lerna with his Croud of Heads Surrounded. Hail! undoubted Son of Jove, New Honour to the Gods! Be present here Propitious, and Thy Sacrifice adorn. Thus They in Songs: But chiefly Cacus' Den They added, and Himself expiring Flames: The Grove all rings, the echoing Hills resound. The holy Feast now ended, All repair Back to the City: Slow, beset with Age, The King moves forward, grasping in his Hands The Trojan Hero, and his youthful Son; And with Variety of long Discourse Deceives the Way. Æneas, wond'ring, throws His nimble Eyes around; with vast Delight The Places views; enquires, and hears explain'd The ancient Monuments. Then Thus the King Evandrus, Founder of the Roman Tow'r: These Woods the native Nymphs, and Fauns possess'd, And Men from Trunks of solid Oak disclos'd. No Custom, These, nor Civil Culture knew, Unskill'd to yoke the Steers, and hoard their Store By Parsimony; nourish'd with the Food Which savage Hunting, and the Trees supply'd. First, exil'd from Olympus, Saturn came, Flying his Kingdoms, and the Arms of Jove; The untaught Race, on These high Hills dispers'd, He first imbody'd, and compos'd with Laws; And Latium rather chose to call the Land, Because in Safety Here he lay conceal'd. Under That King (as ancient Fame relates) The Nation flourish'd in an Age of Gold; So govern'd He the State in pleasing Peace. At length an Age discolour'd, and corrupt, The Love of Having, and the barb'rous Rage Of War succeeded. Next th'Ausonian Bands, And the Sicanian Colony arriv'd: And Saturn's Realm has often chang'd it's Name. Then Kings, and Tybris of Gigantick Size; From whom th'Italian Stream was Tyber call'd; And ancient Albula has lost it's Name. Me, banish'd from my Native Soil, and forc'd To tempt the utmost Perils of the Sea, Almighty Fortune, and resistless Fate, Phœbus my Guide, and She who gave me Birth, The Nymph Carmenta, by their high Commands Plac'd in This Seat, and fix'd my Mansion here. He said; and, moving on, the Altar shew'd, And the Carmental Gate, (a Roman Name) The Honour, 'tis reported, of the Nymph Carmenta, who Prophetick first foretold The future Glory of th'Æneian Race, And noble Pallantéum. Next he shews The spacious Grove, where warlike Romulus Th'Asylum fix'd; and underneath the Brow Of a bleak Cliff, the Place Lupercal nam'd, Where by Arcadian Rites Lycæan Pan Was worship'd. Hated Argiletum's Wood He shews him next, attests the conscious Place, Tells, and abjures the Guilt of Argus' Death. Hence to the Capitol, Tarpeian Seat, He leads, now rich with Gold, then rough with Thorns. Ev'n Then the sacred Horrour of the Place The trembling Rusticks aw'd; ev'n Then the Wood, And Rock with holy Rev'rence they survey'd. This Grove, he said, This Hill with leafy Top (What God 'tis doubtful, but) a God there is Inhabiting: Th'Arcadians think that Jove Himself they oft have seen, when Storms he rous'd, And shook his dreadful Ægis from the Clouds. These two, besides, These Towns with shatter'd Walls The Monuments of ancient Kings you see; This nam'd Janiculum, Saturnia That; One by old Janus, one by Saturn rear'd. With mutual Talk like This at length they came To poor Evander's Court, and round them saw O'er proud Carinæ's Street the Cattle graze, And lowing in the Roman Forum stray. When to the Seat they came, These Gates, he said, Aleides enter'd; Him This Court receiv'd: Dare to scorn Wealth, brave Guest; Presume thy self Worthy to emulate a God; and come Not supercilious to our little State. He said; And underneath his homely Roof Conducts the great Æneas, on spred Leaves, And on a Libyan Bear's rough Hide repos'd. Night hastes, and wraps the World with sable Wings: When Venus, with no causeless Fears alarm'd By threat'ning Latium, and new rising War, Thus, in his golden Bed, to Vulcan speaks; And with her Words inspires Celestial Love. While with destructive War th'Argolick Kings Wasted the Trojan Walls, and Tow'rs, decreed To fall by hostile Fires; No Arms from You, My dearest Lord, no Succour from your Art For wretched Ilion did I Then desire; Nor would have exercis'd your Skill in vain: Tho' much I ow'd to Priam's Sons, and oft With Tears bewail'd Æneas' hapless Toils. Now, since on Latium's Coasts he is arriv'd By Jove's Command; Suppliant to you I come, The Mother for her Son, and sue for Arms; And Thus implore your Deity, by me So much rever'd. You yielded to the Tears Of Nereus' Daughter, and Tithonus' Wife: Behold what Nations from all Parts unite, What Cities shut their Gates, and whet their Swords, All leagu'd to conquer Me, and ruin Mine. She said; And round him threw her snowy Arms, And warm'd him, wav'ring, with a soft Embrace: He soon receives the wonted Flame, which flies Swift thro' his Marrow, and his melting Bones; As when in Thunder, lanc'd along the Sky, A Streak of Fire runs streaming thro' the Clouds. Pleas'd with her Wiles, and conscious of her Charms, She silently perceives it; And involv'd In Love's eternal Bond the God replies. Why, Goddess, seek you Reasons from afar? Or whither is your Confidence in Me Withdrawn? Had Then your Purpose been the same; Ev'n Then I might have arm'd the Trojan Chiefs: Nor did th'Almighty Father, nor the Fates, Decree that Troy no longer should remain; And Priam ten years more might have surviv'd. And now if War you meditate, and such Be your Design; Whatever by my Art Can be perform'd, whatever can be cast In Steel, in Silver, or in running Gold, The utmost Pow'rs of Bellows, and of Fire, I promise: Spare Intreaties; nor distrust Your Int'rest in my Soul. This said; He gave The wish'd Embrace, and sunk to pleasing Rest. When, Night now sliding in her middle Course, The first Repose was finish'd; When the Dame, Who by her Distaff's slender Art subsists, Wakes the spred Embers, and the sleeping Fire, Night adding to her Work; and calls her Maids To their long Tasks, by lighted Tapers urg'd; Thus spotless to preserve her Husband's Bed, And educate her little prattling Babes: From his soft Couch not less industrious rose The fiery God, to ply his forging Toils. Close by Sicania, and th'Æolian Coasts Of Lipare, an Island rises high With smoking Rocks; Beneath it thunder loud Th'Ætnean Caverns, by the Cyclops' Forge Shatter'd and torn: Here beaten Anvils sound With pond'rous Hammers; Bars of hissing Steel Roar in the hollow Mount; And Flakes of Fire Burst thro' the rattling Tunnels: Vulcan's Seat, And from his Name the Land Vulcania call'd. Hither the fiery God from Heav'n descends; The Cyclops in their vast capacious Cave Work'd the tormented Iron; Brontes huge, And Steropes, and with his naked Limbs Pyracmon. In their Hands before them glow'd The unform'd Thunder; Bolts which Jove to Earth Profusely hurls from all the Welkin round: Part finish'd, part imperfect yet remain'd. Three Forks of darted Hail, of watry Cloud Three more they added; Three of glaring Fire; As many of the winged Southern Wind; Then dreadful Flashes, and the roaring Noise, And Rage, and Terrour, and avenging Flames. Some in a diff'rent Quarter of the Grot Labour'd the Chariot, and the rapid Wheels Of Mars, with which vast Cities he alarms, And rouses Heroes. Others carve in Gold, With Scales of Serpents, angry Pallas' Shield, The dreadful Ægis; and the twisted Snakes, And in the Goddess' Breast the Gorgon's Head, Turning it's Eyes, and terrible in Death. Then Vulcan Thus: Set all These things aside, Ætnæan Cyclops; From your Work begun Desist awhile, and hither bend your Thoughts. Arms for a Hero must be made: Now all Your Vigour is requir'd; Now all your Speed, And masterly Invention: Break Delay. He said no more: They all with eager Haste Bend to the Labour; and their sev'ral Tasks Divide: Brass flows in Rivers; Liquid Gold, And wounding Steel, in the vast Furnace boils. A mighty Shield they form, alone oppos'd To all the Latian Darts; Sev'n Orbs involv'd, Orb within Orb: In breathing Bellows Some Receive, and render back th'included Air: Others in Water tinge the sputt'ring Brass; The Cave with batter'd Anvils groans around: They with vast Strength in equal Measures raise Their Arms; and turn the Mass with griping Tongs. While in th'Æolian Coasts the Lemnian God This Work precipitates; the cheerful Light, And early chirping Birds, beneath his Roof, Awake Evander in his humble Bed. The Senior rises; with his homely Coat His Body cloaths, and fastens to his Feet The Tyrrhene Sandals; then th'Arcadian Sword Girds to his Side, and Shoulders; on the left A Panther's Hide retorts: Two trusty Dogs, From the high Gate, attend their Master's Steps. Strait to his Guest's retir'd Apartment goes The Hero, not unmindful of his Word, And promis'd Aid; Him no less early meets Æneas: With the One young Pallas came, Achates with the Other; Hands they join; Then in the Middle of the Court they sit, And freely now their former Talk resume. Then first the King: Brave Trojan Leader, while whose Life remains, I never shall confess that Troy is fall'n; Small are our Succours for so great a Cause: Here by the Tuscan Stream we are confin'd; There the Rutulians press us, and with Arms Clashing surround our Walls. Yet Nations great, Pow'rful, and opulent, I now prepare To join with Yours: This way to Safety leads, By unexpected Fortune shewn; And call'd By sure Decree of Fate you here arrive. Not far from hence, Agylla's City stands, Founded with aged Stone; Where heretofore The Lydian Colony, in Wars renown'd, Settled it's Mansion on th'Etrurian Hills. This Nation, flourishing for many Years, At length the King Mezentius, proud with Sway, Possess'd, and govern'd by Tyrannick Arms. Why should I name the Murders of his Reign Unutterable? and his barb'rous Deeds? Ye Gods, return them all on Him, and His. Ev'n Living Bodies to the Dead he bound, Composing Hands to Hands, and Mouths to Mouths, (Species of Torture!) and with loath'd Embrace Them, bath'd in Stench, and putrifying Gore, By a slow, ling'ring Death, at length consum'd. Quite weary'd out at last his People round With Arms inclose his Court, and Him with Rage Enormous roaring; kill his Friends; and fire His Palace. He amidst the Slaughter flies To the Rutulian Confines, entertain'd By Turnus, and defended by his Arms. Therefore with just Revenge Etruria fir'd All rises; and with present War demands Her King, for Punishment. Thee, Trojan Prince, Their Leader, to These Thousands I will join; For thick o'er all the Shore their Vessels croud, Impatient to behold the Banners wave. Them with predicted Fates the aged Seer Represses: Hear, Ye choice selected Youth Of Lydia, You the Excellence, the Flow'r Of ancient Heroes; whom against the Foe Just Vengeance urges, and with honest Rage Mezentius fires; 'Tis not by Fate allow'd To any of Italian Race to quell So great a Nation: Foreign Leaders chuse. Then in These Fields th'Etrurian Bands encamp'd, Aw'd by the Warnings of the Gods: To Me Tarchon himself Ambassadours dispatch'd, The Crown, the Sceptre, and Regalia sent; Strait to their Tents implor'd me to repair, And in the Tuscan Kingdom to succeed. But Me the Impotence of freezing Age, Unequal to the Labours of the Brave, Envies new Empire: Him I would advise, Pallas, my Son; but that his Mother, born Of Sabine Blood, has mingled in his Veins Part of This Country. Thou, Whose Age, and Race By Fate are favour'd, whom the Gods demand, Proceed to Empire, valiant Chief, at once Chief of the Trojan and th'Italian Pow'rs. Him too, the Hope, and Solace of my Age, Pallas to Thee I join, that he may learn, Under so great a Master to endure The Toils and rigid Discipline of War; Accustom'd to behold Thy God-like Deeds, And taught t'admire Thee from his tender Years. To Him two hundred Horse I give, the Flow'r Of our Arcadian Youth: As many more Pallas to Thee, in his own Name presents. He scarce had spoke; Æneas, and his Friend, Faithful Achates, fix'd in silence stood; Much Grief revolving in their pensive Thoughts. When Cytheréa in the open Air A Signal gave; and suddenly from Heav'n A darted Flash with Thunder came: All seem'd To tremble round them: And along the Sky The Tyrrhene Trumpet's Clangor sounded loud. Upwards they look; Again, again the Crash With mighty Noise redoubles: Shining Arms In a bright Region of the Sky serene They see; and hear them rattling thro' the Clouds. The rest amaz'd; Æneas knows the Sign, And Promise, which his Goddess Mother gave: Then Thus: Enquire not, Royal Host, what Fate Is meant by These Presages, I by Heav'n Am call'd: This Signal was to Me foretold By my Celestial Parent, to be sent, Should threat'ning War approach; and She her self Promis'd to aid me with Vulcanian Arms Brought thro' the Air. What Deaths alas! What Slaughters are decreed To wretched Latium! Turnus, for thy Crimes To Me what bloody Forfeit shalt Thou pay! How many Warriour-Bodies, Helms, and Shields Shall in thy Torrent, Father Tyber, roll! Let them demand a War, and break their Leagues. He said; And from his lofty Seat arose: And first upon th'Herculean Altar wakes The sleeping Fires; and joyfully renews The Sacrifice of Yesterday; the Lar, And little Country-Gods invokes; and kills Choice Sheep by Rite accustom'd: With him join The King Evander, and the Trojan Youth. Then to his Vessels, and his Friends he goes: From whom the Chief in Valour he selects, To follow him in War; The others, sent T'inform Ascanius of his Father's State, And Posture of Affairs, fall down the Stream, And slowly on the gentle River glide. Steeds to the Trojans, for the Tyrrhene Fields Dispatch'd, are giv'n; But One, above the rest Distinguish'd, to Æneas is assign'd, All cover'd with a Lion's tawny Hide, With golden Claws refulgent. Sudden Fame Diffus'd thro' all the little City flies, That to the Palace of the Tyrrhene King A Band of Horse was marching swift in Arms: With Fear the Matrons iterate their Vows; Danger more imminent augments the Dread, And greater now appears the Face of War. Then old Evander, at their Parting, grasps His Hand, and Thus, with endless Weeping, speaks. O! would but Jove restore my former Years; And make me what I was, when ev'n beneath Præneste's Walls, I fell'd the foremost Rank, And Victor burnt a Heap of Shields; and sent With This Right hand King Herilus to Hell. On Him, her Son, Feronia, at his Birth, (Prodigious to relate!) three Lives bestow'd; Three Suits of Arms he wielded; thrice by Death He was to be subdu'd: Yet This Right hand Depriv'd him, in That Field, of all his Lives, And strip'd him of as many Suits of Arms. Were I but Such; I should not now, my Son, Be torn from thy Embraces; nor o'er Me Insulting, should Mezentius, near my Coasts, Have made such barb'rous Ravage with the Sword, Nor rob'd the City of so many Lives. But You, Ye Gods, and Thou, Almighty Jove, Great Sov'reign of the Gods, commiserate Th'Arcadian King, and hear a Father's Pray'r. If Fate and You preserve my Pallas safe; If Him I live to meet, and see restor'd: Life I implore; With Pleasure I submit To any Toils. But if some dire Mishap, Fortune, by Thee is threaten'd: Now, O! now Rid me of cruel Life; while yet my Cares Are doubtful, and our future Lot unknown; While Thee, dear Youth, my late, my only Joy, I strain in this Embrace: That such harsh Tidings May never wound my Ears. With Sobs and Groans The aged Sire Thus breath'd his last Farewel: The Servants bear him fainting to his Court. And now forth issues from the open Gates The Horse-Brigade: Æneas, and his Friend Faithful Achates, in the foremost Rank; In order next the other Lords of Troy. Pallas himself advances in the Midst, Conspicuous in his Cloak, and painted Arms: As when the Star by Venus most belov'd, Bright Lucifer, just wash'd in Ocean's Waves, Upraises in the Sky his sacred Head, And dissipates the Shades. The trembling Dames Stand on the Walls, and follow with their Eyes The Cloud of Dust, and Troops with polish'd Brass Refulgent. Thro' the Thickets they pursue The nearest Way in Arms: A Shout is rais'd; And, in a Body form'd, with sounding Hoofs The sprightly Horses shake the mould'ring Soil. Near the cool Stream of Cære stands a Grove, By the Religion of the ancient Sires Held venerable; spacious in Extent, With hollow Hills, and gloomy Fir inclos'd. The old Pelasgi, (so Tradition tells) The first Possessors of the Latian Coasts, This Grove devoted to the Rural God Sylvanus, and a sacred Day assign'd. Not far from hence the Tyrrhenes lay entrench'd In a safe Post, with Tarchon at their Head: And now the Legions from a Mountain's Height Appear'd in View, encamp'd upon the Plains. To these Æneas, and the Youth for War Selected, join their Body; and fatigu'd With Toil, their Horses, and Themselves repose. But lovely Venus, thro' th'Ethereal Clouds Bearing her Present came: When She her Son From the cool River at a distance saw, And in a Vale retir'd; with easy Grace Her self discov'ring, Thus the Goddess spoke. Behold, my Son, the long-expected Gift, Completed by my Consort's promis'd Art; That Thou the proud Laurentians may'st defy, And challenge daring Turnus to the Fight. She said; embrac'd him, and beneath an Oak, Full opposite, the radiant Armour laid. Proud of such Honour, and the Gift Divine, Round all the Work he rolls his wond'ring Eyes, Insatiate; turns and poises in his Hands The dreadful crested Helm, which vomits Flames; The fatal Sword; the Corslet stiff with Brass, Sanguine, immense; As when an azure Cloud Glows, gilded by the Sun, and burns from far: The polish'd Cuisses next, of Gold refin'd, And ductile Silver; and the Spear; and last Th'unutterable Texture of the Shield. There, not unknowing in the Schemes of Fate, And coming Times, the fiery God had form'd The future Annals of th'Italian Realms, And Roman Triumphs; all the Race deriv'd From young Ascanius; and the Battles fought In Order. In the mossy Cave of Mars A female Wolf lay suckling; At her Teats Two sporting Infants hung, and lick'd their Dam, Intrepid: She her sleek round Neck reclin'd, Smooth'd them by turns, and form'd them with her Tongue. Next Rome he added, and the Sabines seiz'd By Rape enormous, at the solemn Sports, Within the spacious Cirque; Thence mighty War Sudden betwixt the Romans, and the King Old Tatius and his rigid Cures rose. Then the same Chiefs (their bloody Feuds at length Suspended) arm'd before Jove's Altar stood, Each with a Charger in his Hand; A Sow They sacrific'd, and ratify'd the League. Not far from thence the rapid Chariots driv'n Flew diverse, and the Traytor Metius tore; (Thou, Alban, shouldst have kept thy plighted Faith:) Him Tullus thro' the Woods rent piecemeal drag'd, The sprinkled Brambles dropping with his Blood. Porsenna next attempts to reinstate Ejected Tarquin; and surrounds the Walls With pressing Siege: In Liberty's Defence Th'Æneadæ undaunted rush to Arms. Him, in the Sculpture, with a storming Air, And terribly indignant, you might see; That Cocles had presum'd to burst the Bridge, And Clelia freed from Bonds had swom the Stream. High on Tarpeia's Tow'r brave Manlius stood, Defender of the Temple; and possess'd The lofty Capitol: Here rough appear'd The Palace, recent with Romulean Straw; And, in the golden Cloysters flutt'ring round, A silver Goose betray'd th'approaching Gauls: Th'approaching Gauls along the Thickets came; And now had seiz'd the Fort, by gloomy Shades Protected, and by favour of the Night. With golden Hair they shine, with golden Vests, And chequer'd Cloaks; Their milk-white Necks entwin'd With Chains of Gold: Each brandish'd in his Hand Two Alpine Jav'lins; with a Length of Shield Their Bodys cover'd o'er. He added next The dancing Salii; And with naked Limbs The mad Luperci; And the Caps of Wool; And Targets drop'd from Heav'n: The Matrons chaste In downy Litters to the Temples rode, And thro' the City bore the sacred Rites. Distant from hence th'Infernal Realms he drew, And Pluto's Court; the Tortures of the Damn'd; Thee, Catiline, suspended on a Rock, And trembling at the Furies: And the Bless'd Apart; To These just Cato giving Laws. Among the various Figures, rolling wide Th'Effigies of the Ocean swells in Gold, Whiten'd with curling Foam; And all around The Dolphins, bright in Silver, lash the Brine With their broad Tails, and wheeling cut the Waves. Full in the Midst the brazen-beaky Ships, And Actium's Battle rises to the View; All mount Leucate hurry'd with the Rage, And regular Confusion of the War; And Billows radiant with the Gleam of Gold. Here to the Fight Augustus Cæsar leads His Romans; with the Fathers, and the State, His Country Deitys, and mightier Gods; On the tall Deck sublime: Whose Temples, fir'd With lambent Glory, flash two Flames, and all His Father's Star burns open'd on his Crest. High on another Deck Agrippa heads His Squadron, with auspicious Winds, and Gods; His Temples shining with a beaky Crown, The Recompence, and Pride of Naval War. Antonius Victor, with Barbarian Aids, And Arms promiscuous, from the redden'd Shore, And Nations of the Morning, comes adverse; Brings Ægypt with him, and the Eastern Force, And distant Bactrians; and (reproachful Sight!) His Shame attends him, his Ægyptian Wife. All rush at once; And all the Ocean foams Convuls'd with dashing Oars, and trident Beaks. They hoise to Sea: The Cyclades uptorn You would have thought were floating on the Deep; Or lofty Hills encountring Hills: So huge The Tow'ring Vessels, rigg'd and mann'd for War. Fire-Balls of Tow, and missile Jav'lins fly; The recent Gore discolours Neptune's Fields. The Queen her Forces rallys in the Midst, Shaking her Country Timbrel; nor as yet Perceives her two attending Asps behind. Anubis, barking Deity, and all The Monster-Gods of ev'ry Kind advance, 'Gainst Neptune, Venus, and Minerva, rang'd. Amidst the thickest Battle Mavors storms In Iron Sculpture; And the Diræ sent From Heav'n; And Discord, with her Mantle torn, Marches exulting: With her bloody Scourge Bellona follows arm'd. To see the War, Actian Apollo hovers in the Clouds, And bends his Bow: By Him with Terrour struck All Ægypt's, India's, and Sabæa's Lines, And all Arabia's turn their Backs in Flight. The Queen her self, inviting all the Winds, Swift hois'd her Sails, and loos'd the twisted Cords. Her pale, amidst the Slaughter, at th'Approach Of future Death, the fiery God had wrought, Wafted by Eastern Breezes down the Tide: Full opposite great Nilus mourning rolls His Fluent, into his cerulean Lap Invites the vanquish'd Troops, and opens all His wavy Garment to receive their Flight. But Cæsar, riding to the Walls of Rome With triple Triumph, to th'Italian Gods Devotes three hundred stately Temples, Vow Immortal: With rejoicing Shouts, and Sports, And festival Applause the Streets resound: In all the Temples Quires of Matrons croud; Altars in All erected; On the Ground Before Those Altars slaughter'd Oxen fall. Himself, high seated in the marble Porch Of Phœbus' Dome, reviews the People's Gifts, And fits them fasten'd to the lofty Doors. The conquer'd, Nations in long Order go, Various in Language, as in Garb, and Arms. There Mulciber the Nomades had drawn, The Libyans loosely clad, the Lelages, The Cares, and Geloni arm'd with Darts; Euphrates drawing now a gentler Train; Th'extremest Morini, the two-horn'd Rhine; The untam'd Dahæ, and Araxes' Stream Indignant with a Bridge to be confin'd. Such Figures on the broad Vulcanian Shield, His Mother's Gift, the Hero pleas'd admires In Ignorance; And on his Shoulder high Upheaves the Fame, and Fortune of his Race. The End of the Eighth Book. BOOK the Ninth. While Schemes like These in distant Parts are form'd; Saturnian Juno Iris sends from Heav'n To daring Turnus: In the sacred Vale, And Grove of old Pilumnus, then by chance The Hero sate: To Him Thaumantias spoke, And from her rosy Mouth These Accents fell. Turnus, What None of all the Gods could dare To promise to thy Wishes, see, the Course Of rolling Time spontaneous has bestow'd. Æneas, from his Town, and Friends, and Fleet, Absent, to Palatine Evander's Realms Is now repair'd; and not content with That To Coritus' most distant Towns has pierc'd, And arms the Lydian Rusticks for the War. On What demur thy Thoughts? 'Tis now the Time To mount thy Steeds, and Chariot: Break Delay, And swift surprize their unprovided Camp. This said, on even Wings uprais'd she flew, And cut her spacious Arch beneath the Clouds. The Youth soon knew her, lifted to the Stars His Hands, and with These Words pursu'd her Flight. Iris, the Pride of Heav'n; Who sent Thee down To Earth, and Me? From whence This sudden Light Diffus'd? I see the op'ning Sky divide, And the Stars straggling round the Pole: Portents So wond'rous I obey; whoe'er Thou art Who summon'st me to Arms. This said, he skims Pure Water from the Surface of the Stream; Invokes the Gods, and loads the Sky with Vows. Now all the Army march'd upon the Plain, Rich in proud Steeds, in broider'd Vests, and Gold. Messapus leads the Van, the Rear the Sons Of Tyrrheus; In the Centre Turnus moves, Chief, by the Head entire above them all, And tow'rs in Arms. Slow, without Noise they march: As, by sev'n Rivers swell'd, in silence flows Ganges profound; or with his fruitful Stream Nilus, when, ebbing from the Fields, he draws His Train, and in his Chanel glides confin'd. The Trojans here a sudden Cloud of Dust Discern, and Darkness rising o'er the Field. First from the Mound adverse Caïcus cries; What Globe, Ye Citizens, is yonder roll'd, Black'ning in Air? Stand to your Arms, Dispatch, Quick, draw your Weapons, and the Ramparts crown; The Foe approaches: Haste. With Clamour loud The Trojans shut their Gates, and fill the Walls: For so Æneas, most expert in Arms, Parting, had giv'n Command, that in the Fight (If any Fortune should mean-while present) They should not dare, nor trust the open Field; But man their Trenches, and defend the Camp. Therefore tho' Shame and Indignation fire Their Souls to Battle; mindful they obey His Orders, to the War their Gates oppose, And in their Turrets arm'd expect the Foe. Before his tardy Squadron Turnus flies, With twenty chosen Horse; and to the Town Sudden approach'd: Whom with white Spots distinct A Thracian Courser bore; with crimson Plumes A golden Helmet glitt'ring round his Head. What Youth, he cry'd, with Me will first advance Against the Foe? See there: Then hurls a Dart Into the Sky, the Prelude of the War; And spurs with stately Port along the Field. With terrible Acclaim his Men concur, And shouting follow. The degen'rate Souls Of the dull dastard Trojans they admire; Admire that None should dare to trust the Plain In equal Fight, nor obvious rush in Arms, But all within their Trenches lurk confin'd. He, turbulent in Ire, surveys the Walls, This way, and That, and on his lofty Steed The Passes inaccessible explores. So raves the prouling Wolf around the Cotts, Insidious to invade the crouded Fold, At Midnight, passive from the Winds and Rain: The tender Younglings bleat beneath their Dams In safety: He, malicious in his Rage, Gnashes his Teeth against the distant Prey; Hunger, long since contracted, goads him on, And Jaws undrench'd with Gore. Not less incens'd (His Blood with Indignation boiling high) The fierce Rutulian storms, as he beholds The guarded Walls, and Bulwarks of his Foes; Doubtful which Post to try, and how to draw The Trojans from their Trenches to the Field. Their Fleet, which near the Fortress cover'd lay, Fenc'd by their Ramparts, and the River's Stream, He strait invades; excites his shouting Troops With Fire to fill their Hands; and waves, himself, A flaming Pine. By Turnus' Presence urg'd They ply the Work industrious; All the Youth Rifle the Hearths, and arm themselves with Brands: The smouldring Torches throw the pitchy Light Aloft, and Vulcan sparkles to the Stars. What God, Ye Muses, from the Trojan Ships Averted such a fiery Tempest? Say; Ancient the Fact, but constant is the Fame. On Phrygian Ida when Æneas built His Navy, and prepar'd to stem the Deep; Thus Berecynthia, Mother of the Gods, To mighty Jove, 'tis said, her Suit address'd. Grant me, my Son, what thy lov'd Parent asks Of Thee, succeeding to the Throne of Heav'n. A Piny Wood for many Years there grew On the high Mountain's Top, my Fav'rite Grove, (To which my Votaries their Off'rings brought) Obscure with gloomy Fir, and Maple Boughs. This Timber to th'illustrious Youth of Troy, When indigent of Ships, I gladly gave. Now a new Fear disturbs my anxious Thoughts; Heal thou That Fear; and let thy Mother prove So potent by her Pray'rs, that to no Length Of Voyage, to no Tempest they may yield: Let it avail them, that they once were Mine. To whom her Son, who whirls the Starry Spheres: O Mother, which way would you turn the Fates? Or what would you request? Shall Vessels, built By mortal Hands, immortal Rights enjoy? And shall Æneas certain pass thro' Toils Uncertain? To what God is giv'n such Pow'r? Yet when; Those Toils exhausted, they shall reach Their destin'd Limits, and th'Ausonian Ports: In All, which shall escape the Waves, and bring The Trojan Leader to Laurentum's Fields, In Tract of rolling Time, their mortal Form I will destroy, and give them to be Nymphs Of the wide Deep; as Doto, Nereus-born, And Galatea cut the foaming Sea. He said; and by his Stygian Brother's Banks, And pitchy Torrent, ratify'd the Fate; And all Olympus trembled at his Nod. And now the promis'd Time was fully come, Ripen'd by Destiny; when, by the Force Which Turnus threaten'd, the Celestial Dame Was warn'd to save the sacred Ships from Fire. Here to their Eyes a sudden Stream of Light Wond'rous appear'd; and darted from the East A shining Tempest shot along the Sky: Th'Idæan Quire was heard; and thro' the Air An awful Voice fill'd either Host with Dread. Haste not, Ye Trojans, to defend my Ships; Nor arm your Hands: The Ocean shall be burnt By Turnus, sooner than These hallow'd Pines. Go You, Ye Goddesses, into the Sea, Go free: The Mother of the Gods commands. Forthwith each Vessel, from it's Cable loos'd, Plunges into the Deep; and with it's Beak Dives like a Dolphin, underneath the Waves. Instead of Them (prodigious to relate!) So many Virgin Forms appear, and glide Upon the Sea, as just before there stood Tall Ships with brazen Prows along the Beach. The Rutuli in Wonder stand aghast; Messapus' self affrighted scarce restrains His startled Steeds; old Tyber stops his Course, And refluent from the Ocean hoarsely roars. Yet nought bold Turnus of his Fire abates; But Thus encourages, and chides his Friends. Against the Trojans These Portents are aim'd: Great Jove himself of their accustom'd Aid Deprives them Thus; nor do their Ships expect Th'Ausonian Arms, and Fires. The Ocean then To Them impervious leaves no Hope of Flight; The Globe's One Half is lost: The Land is Ours; So many Thousands of th'Italian States Engage in Arms. Me nought the Fates affright, Whate'er they be, of which the Phrygians boast; Enough to Venus and the Fates is giv'n; Since, landing on Ausonia's fertil Shores, The Trojans are arriv'd. My Fates oppos'd I too can shew; which grant me to destroy With wasteful War the Sacrilegious Race, And right my self defrauded of my Bride. Nor do the Greeks alone resent such Wrongs; Nor are Mycenæ's Kings the only Chiefs, Who, to revenge such Insults, rush to Arms. But 'twas enough, perhaps, that once they fell: And once too was enough to make them hate The Female Kind, and Thus offend no more. Did These, who in their Trenches now confide, Slight thin Partitions 'twixt themselves and Death; Did These not see the Walls of mighty Troy, Tho' built by Neptune, tumble in the Flames? But who, Ye chosen Youth, who scales with Me Their Bulwarks, and invades their trembling Camp? Against the Trojans no Vulcanian Arms, Nor twice five hundred Ships do I require. Let all Etruria join her Bands ally'd: Nocturnal coward Thefts they need not fear; Their fam'd Palladium we shall not purloin, Killing the Guards, who watch the lofty Tow'r; Nor in the Steed's dark Belly lurk conceal'd. In open Light of Day, it is resolv'd, We will appear, and wrap their Walls in Flames: Soon shall they see, my Promise I engage, They have not here to deal with Grecian Foes, Whom Hector to the Tenth Year kept at Bay. For what remains; since rolling to the West The Day declines, and Conquest is in View; With joyous Cheer, Ye warlike Youth, indulge Your Genius, and expect the promis'd Fight. Mean-while the Charge is to Messapus giv'n With Scouts and Sentries to beset their Gates, And all with Fires inclose their Trenches round. Twice sev'n Rutulians to observe their Walls Are chosen; Each of Them an hundred Youths With purple Plumes, and broider'd Vests, attend. Alternate they patrole, by turns relieve Each other's Posts; and stretch'd along the Grass Indulge the Wine, and toss the brazen Jars. Their Fires shine round: The Watch in Sports protract The sleepless Night. All This the Trojans from their lofty Mounds Trembling behold, and man their Works in Arms; With anxious Fear the guarded Gates explore, And join the Battlements with Bridges laid. Mnestheus, and brave Serestus urge the Toil; To whom the Prince Æneas had assign'd The chief Direction of Affairs, if aught Adverse should chance: Each Legion on the Walls, Sharing th'allotted Danger, mounts the Watch Alternate, and it's proper Post defends. To guard the Gate brave Nisus stood in Arms, Nisus Hyrtacides; whom Ida, fam'd For Hunting, sent into Æneas' Train, Skill'd in the Jav'lin, and the feather'd Shafts: And by his Side, Euryalus; than whom Was none more beauteous, clad in Trojan Arms: The first soft Down of Youth had just begun To bloom upon his Cheeks: One was their Love; Together They engag'd in War; and now Both in one common Post, as Sentries, stood. Then Nisus; Do the Gods, my Friend, infuse This Ardour of the Soul? Or make we Gods Of our own strong Desires? My Mind, long since Eager of Action, prompts me to engage Or in the Fight, or in some great Attempt; Nor This dull Rest endures. What Confidence Possesses the Rutulian Camp, thou seest. Thin burn their Fires: Dissolv'd in Sleep and Wine They lie; and all around dead Silence reigns. Now learn what Thoughts, what Purpose I revolve, Dubious of Mind. The Fathers, and the State Long to recall Æneas, and dispatch Sure Messengers, who Tidings may convey. If (for to Me the Glory of the Deed Is ample Recompence) to Thee they grant What I demand; methinks, beneath That Hill I mark the Way to Pallantéum's Walls. Struck with Surprize, and fir'd with Thirst of Fame, Thus sudden to his ardent Friend reply'd Euryalus. And would'st thou then refuse To add Me, Nisus, to the brave Design? And shall I suffer Thee to go expos'd To such a perilous Attempt alone? Not so my Sire Opheltes, bred in War, Amidst the Terrour of the Grecian Arms, And the long Labours of unhappy Troy, Instructed me: Nor so have I behav'd In Partnership with Thee; since I adher'd To brave Æneas, and th'Extremes of Fate. Here too, Here dwells a Soul, that with Contempt Regards This vital Air; and thinks with Life That Fame well bought, to which Thy Soul aspires. Nisus to This; No such injurious Thought Of Thee; no such Suspicion, in my Breast Was ever harbour'd: No; as This is Truth, So may great Jove, or whate'er God regards These things with equal Eyes, restore me crown'd With Conquest to thy Arms. But if some Chance (As many in such hazardous Attempts Thou seest) if any Chance, or Pow'r Divine Snatch Me from Earth; Thee I would leave behind: Thy Age can shew a better Claim to Life. Let there survive, who may with solemn Rites Inurn my Body, rescu'd from the Foe In Battle, or redeem by Ransom paid; Or (That if Fate forbid) an empty Tomb May build, and grace my Manes with a Grave. Nor to thy wretched Mother let me cause So great a Grief; thy Mother, who, alone Of all the Trojan Dames, for Thee, Dear Youth, Follows our Camp, nor loves Acestes' Walls. Then He; Thy empty Reasons urg'd in vain Thou dost alledge; nor is my Purpose chang'd: Haste we, he said. Then wakes the Sentries; They Succeed, and mount the Guard: The friendly Pair, Quitting their Station, seek the Gen'ral's Tent. All other Creatures, o'er the Earth repos'd, Relax their Cares, and lose the Toils of Day; The Trojan Leaders, and the chosen Youth Upon th'important Bus'ness of the State A Council held; what Measures they should take, Who to Æneas should be sent dispatch'd. On their long Spears they lean, and gripe their Shields, In the mid Camp. Then Nisus, and with Him Euryalus, with eager Speed demand Admittance; urging an Affair of Weight, And worthy their Delay. Iülus first Receives them panting, and bids Nisus speak. Then Thus Hyrtacides: Ye Trojans, hear With equal Minds; nor let the bold Attempt Propos'd be estimated from our Years. The Rutuli, immers'd in Sleep and Wine, All silent lie: A Place we have observ'd Fit for our Purpose, where the Way divides Before the Gate which opens to the Sea. Their Fires by fits burn faint; and to the Stars Black Smoke ascends: Permit us but to take Th'Advantage; and you soon shall see return'd Your wish'd Æneas from Pallantium's Walls, With Spoils, and mighty Slaughter of the Foe. Nor are we uninstructed in the Way: For, hunting near the Coasts, we oft have seen The City's Confines in the Vales obscure, And all the Windings of the River know. Alethes then, in Wisdom and in Years Mature, reply'd. Ye Tutelary Gods, Whose fav'ring Pow'r protects the State of Troy; As yet to Ruin you devote not all The Trojan Race; since still such gallant Youths, Such firm intrepid Spirits you preserve. So saying, with a tender strict Embrace He strain'd them Both, and hung upon their Hands; And drown'd his Visage with o'erflowing Tears. What due Rewards, brave Youths, shall I presume Proportion'd to so daring a Design? The Chief the Gods, and your own Native Worth, The Rest ev'n Now shall good Æneas give, And young Ascanius, when Mature of Age, For ever mindful of Desert like Yours. And I, whose only Happiness depends Upon my much-lov'd Father's wish'd Return, Reply'd Ascanius, by our mighty Gods, Nisus, to You I swear, by Vesta's Shrine, And by the Trojan Lares; all my Hope And Fortune in your Bosoms I repose: Recall my Father, bring him to my Arms; All Sorrow vanishes at his Return: Two Goblets I will give, in Silver wrought, And rough with Sculpture; which my Father took From sack'd Arisba; And two Talents Weight Of massy Gold; two Tripods; And a Bowl Of antique Cast, which Tyrian Dido gave. But if 'tis giv'n us in the Chance of War To conquer Latium, and it's Sceptre wield, Victorious, and by Lot to share the Spoils; Saw'st thou the Steed which Turnus press'd, the Arms In which he rode, all glitt'ring, all in Gold? That very Shield, and Those red Plumes which grace His Helmet, from the Lot I will exempt, Already, Nisus, Thy adjudg'd Reward. Besides, twelve choicest Dames, twelve Captive Youths, With their own Arms, my Father shall bestow; And, added to them all, That Tract of Land, Which by the King Latinus is possess'd. But Thou, whose Age by Mine with nearer Steps Is follow'd, Thee, Thou venerable Youth, Thee into all my Bosom I receive; And clasp Thee close, the Partner of my Soul In all Events; Without Thee no Renown, No Glory will I seek in. Peace, or War: In Thee my greatest Trust of Deeds and Words I will repose. He said; and Thus reply'd Euryalus: From brave Attempts like These No Time shall argue me degen'rate prov'd; Let Fortune but be kind. Yet more than all Rewards, and Prizes, one thing I implore: I have a Mother, from the ancient Race Of Priam sprung; whose Fondness for her Son Urg'd her, unhappy, thro' the Toils of War, To follow me: Nor could the Ilian Coast Detain her, nor the King Acestes' Walls. Her, ignorant of whate'er Fate impends, Unbless'd, and unsaluting, I forsake: This Night, and thy Right hand I here attest, I cannot bear my Wretched Parent's Tears. But Thou, I beg, console her helpless Age, And aid her desolate: Thus much of Thee Grant me to hope; More daring I shall go To all Events. Struck with the moving Sounds The Trojans melt in Tears; Above the rest Beauteous Iülus: And the Image soft Of filial Piety glides o'er his Mind. Then Thus: All things I promise, which thy great Design So justly claims: My Mother She shall be; And nothing of Creüsa, but the Name, Be wanting: And whatever Chance betides This Enterprize; Not small shall be esteem'd Her Merit to have born so brave a Son. Here by This Head I swear, (an Oath which first My Father us'd) Whatever I engage To Thee returning, and with Conquest crown'd, The Same shall to thy Mother, and the Race Ally'd to Thee inviolate remain. Weeping he spoke; and drawing from his Belt His gilded Sword, which wrought with wond'rous Art Lycaon, born of Gnossian Race, had made, And in an Iv'ry Scabbard fit inclos'd, That Present on the lovely Youth bestows. Mnestheus a Lion's horrid Reliques gives To Nisus; good Alethes changes Shields. Now arm'd They march; Whom parting, to the Gates, The aged Sires, and all the youthful Band Of the first Rank, with ardent Pray'rs, and Vows, Crouding attend: Nor less the beauteous Prince, In Care and Counsel wise beyond his Years, Various Dispatches to his Father sends, And loads them with Instructions: But the Winds Disperse them all, and give them to the Clouds. They pass the Trenches; and thro' Shades of Night Strait to the hostile Camp direct their Way; Yet fatal first to Many. On the Grass They see them stretch'd in Sleep, and drench'd in Wine; Their Chariots on the Shore erect; The Men Betwixt the Wheels and Harness; Arms and Wine Promiscuous. To his Friend Thus Nisus speaks: Euryalus, 'tis now the Time to dare; Here lies our Way; Be Thou upon the Watch, Lest any Foe assault us from behind: Thro' These I'll hew thee out a Passage wide. He said; repress'd his Voice; and with his Sword On haughty Rhamnes drove; as then by chance Bolster'd aloft on Tapestry he lay, And snoring puff'd the Sleep from all his Breast; Himself a King, and by King Turnus lov'd, A skilful Augur: But his Augury That Pest could not avert. Three Servants next Of Rhemus, as among the Arms they lay Mingled; he stabs; his Squire, and Charioteer, Beneath the Horses Feet; and with his Steel Divides their hanging Necks in Sleep reclin'd. Then from their Master's self his Head he hews, And leaves the welt'ring Trunk; The Earth and Beds Reek with black tepid Gore: Next Lamyrus, And Lamus; and Serranus, hapless Youth Of beauteous Form, who much That Night had play'd, And with large Portion of the jolly God Lay steep'd, o'erpow'r'd: Well for him had it been, Had his long Play continu'd 'till the Morn. So foams the Lion thro' the crouded Folds, By furious Hunger pinch'd; and rends, and drags The tender Cattle, mute with Fear; and raves With bloody Mouth. Nor less Euryalus Distributes Death, nor rages less incens'd: Much nameless Vulgar in the Midst invades, Fadus, and Hebesus, and Rhætus kills, And Abaris: The rest in Sleep secure; But Rhætus, waking, and beholding all, Behind a spacious Cistern skulk'd for Fear: Full, as he rose, he bury'd all the Sword Deep in his Breast; and with abundant Death Receiv'd him: He with gushing Wine and Gore Vomits his purple Soul; and dying pours A blended Flood. Euryalus still burns With vengeful Rage, and silent presses on. Now near Messapus' Quarters he arriv'd; Where the last Fires scarce twinkling he beheld, And Horses ty'd, and grazing: When in brief Thus Nisus; (for he saw the Youth too far By Love of Slaughter hurry'd:) Cease we now; The Dawn, unfriendly to These Thefts, appears: Enough of Blood is spilt; and thro' the Foes A Passage made. Much massy Plate they leave, Rich Tapestry, carv'd Bowls, and polish'd Arms. Yet would Euryalus the studded Belt, And wrought Caparisons of Rhamnes seise; Which to Tiburtian Remulus of old The wealthy Cædicus in Absence sent, Pledges of Hospitality and Love: Them to his Grandson dying he bequeath'd; After his Death, the Rutuli in War Had won them: These Euryalus now wears, And to his manly Shoulders fits in vain: Messapus' plumy Helmet then he takes; They leave the Tents, and seek the safer Field. Meanwhile dispatch'd from King Latinus' Walls (The slower Foot attending on the Plain) Three hundred Horse, all shielded, Volscens Chief, March'd, and sure Tidings to Prince Turnus bore. They now approach'd the Camp, and near the Trench Arriv'd: When making to the left they spy'd The friendly Pair; and in the Moon's pale Light The glimm'ring Helm betray'd Euryalus Unmindful, and with Rays reflected shone. Not seen in vain, cry'd Volscens, from the Troop; Stand there; Who are you? Whither Thus in Arms Bend you your Course? No Answer they return, But scud into the Woods, and trust to Night. The Horsemen to the Ways which well they know, Crossing the various Roads, themselves oppose; And all with Guards beset the Passes round. A Grove there was, with Shrubs and gloomy Oak Horrid, and all with Brambles thick o'ergrown; Thro' which few narrow Paths obscurely led. Euryalus, incumber'd with his Spoils, And heavy Arms, embarass'd with the Fear Of erring from the Way, among the Boughs, In Darkness, lost, and hamper'd, lags behind. Nisus, uncautious, had escap'd the Foe, And pass'd Those Fields, which since from Alba's Walls Are Alban nam'd; For King Latinus' Steeds High Stables then there stood. When first he stop'd, Look'd back in vain, and miss'd his absent Friend; Ah! where Euryalus, unhappy Youth, Where have I left thee? Whither shall I turn? Again the Wood's fallacious Maze perplex'd He back revolves, his former Steps retrac'd Observes, and o'er the silent Thicket roves. He hears the Noises of Pursuers, hears The neighing Horses, and their trampling Feet. Not long he stood; When strait a Clamour loud Invades his Ears: Amidst the Throng of Foes Euryalus he sees, surpriz'd in Night, And Errours of the Way; by sudden Force Oppress'd, and making various Efforts vain. What should he do? By what Assault, what Arms Attempt his Rescue? Should he fling himself, Certain to die, among their thickest Ranks, And meet the glorious Death? With Arm drawn back He pois'd a Spear; and, casting on the Moon A mournful Look, Thus suppliant breath'd his Pray'r. Pride of the Stars, and Guardian of the Woods, Thou, Goddess, Thou Latonia, aid my Toil: If e'er my Father Hyrtacus for Me With Off'rings grac'd thy Altars; If my self Have e'er increas'd them with my sylvan Spoils, Hung them aloft, and to Thy sacred Roofs Affix'd Those Trophys; Give me to disperse This Band, and guide my Jav'lins thro' the Air. He said; And hurl'd with all his Body's Force The Spear; which flying beats the Shades of Night; Fixes in Sulmo's Back averse; and there The Wood breaks short; the pointed Steel divides His Lungs, and whizzing passes thro' his Breast. Shiv'ring he totters, from his Bosom pours A reeking Flood, and with long Sobs distends His heaving Entrails. They aghast look round; He, by Success more animated, aims Another Jav'lin level'd from his Ear: While They in Doubt stand trembling; thro' the Skull Of Tagus swift the hissing Weapon flew, And warm, and deep, lay bury'd in his Brain. Volscens impatient foams, and burns with Rage; Nor sees the Author of their Deaths, nor finds On whom to wreak his Vengeance. Yet Thy Blood, He cry'd, shall pay the Forfeit due for Both; And, with his Sword unsheath'd, advanc'd direct Against Euryalus. Then Nisus, wild With Terrour, and Amaze, crys out aloud; Nor longer in the Covert of the Grove Could hide himself, nor such a Sight endure. Me, Me; I did it; On Me turn your Steel, Ye Rutuli; 'Twas all My Fraud: He nought Nor could, nor durst; This Heav'n, and conscious Stars I call to Witness: All his Crime, poor Youth, Was loving his unhappy Friend too well. Thus far he spoke; But driv'n with forceful Swing The Sword had pierc'd Euryalus, and bor'd His snowy Breast: He stagg'ring rolls in Death; The trickling Blood runs down his beauteous Limbs; And on his Shoulder lies his Neck reclin'd. So languishes, and dies a purple Flow'r, Cut by the pointed Share: So Poppies droop, O'ercharg'd with Rain, and hang their sickly Heads. Then Nisus, rushing, darts into the Midst; Volscens alone he seeks, at Volscens drives: The pressing Foes throng round, and bear him back With tilted Spears: He not the less springs on, And whirls his flashing Sword; 'till in the Mouth, Full opposite, of Volscens clam'ring loud He plung'd it deep, and dying stab'd his Foe: Then on his breathless Friend his Body flung, And there at last in pleasing Death repos'd. Thrice happy Both! If aught my Verse can do; No Time shall blot you from the Lists of Fame: While in the lofty Capitol, unmov'd Like it's own Rock, th'Æneian Race shall reign; And Rome possess the Empire of the World. The Rutuli, with mighty Conquest proud, And deck'd with Trophies, weeping to the Camp Dead Volscens bear: Nor in the Camp was less Of Grief; when Rhamnes pale in Death they found, And Numa, and Serranus, all at once So many Leaders slain: In Crouds they throng About the Bodys welt'ring in their Blood, The recent Slaughter, and the reeking Ground, And Rivers frothing with a Tide of Gore. The Spoils among themselves full well they know, Messapus' glitt'ring Helmet, and the rich Caparisons with so much Toil regain'd. Aurora, from Tithonus' saffron Bed Now rising, sprinkled-o'er the World with Light; The Sun diffus'd, all Nature stands reveal'd: Turnus excites the Soldiery to Arms, Himself in Arms: All marshal for the Fight Their brazen Squadrons; and with various Talk, Exasperated, whet each other's Rage. Then (ghastly to behold!) the gory Heads Of Nisus and Euryalus they fix On Spears aloft; and follow, with a Shout Rending the Air. The hardy Trojans on the left-hand Walls (The River guards the Right) oppose their War, Within their roomy Trenches range their Line, And pensive on the high-built Turrets stand. They see the Faces, which too well they know, Dropping black Blood, and all deform'd with Death. Meanwhile the fatal Tidings, blaz'd by Fame, Flying thro' all the City struck with Dread, The Mother of Euryalus alarms: A sudden Chilness seiz'd her shiv'ring Limbs; From her slack Hand down drops th'unravel'd Web; Springing, distracted, from her Seat, she rends Her Hair with female Shrieks; and to the Walls, And foremost Squadrons runs with frantick Pace; Heedless of Danger, and the flying Darts: And with her loud Laments fills all the Sky. Thus then do I behold thee? O my Son, My dear Euryalus? And art Thou He, The late, the only Solace of my Age? Couldst thou forsake me desolate, forlorn, Ah cruel? Could'st thou, to such Perils sent, Deny thy wretched Mother Leave to take Her last Farewel? Now in a Land unknown Thou ly'st, to Latian Dogs and Fowls a Prey! Nor did thy Mother for the Grave compose Thy Corps, nor close thy Eyes, nor bath thy Wounds; Nor o'er thy breathless Body throw the Robe, Which, studious, Night and Day for Thee I wove, And with the Web consol'd my Widow's Cares. Where shall I seek thee now? What Earth detains Thy Trunk dishonour'd, and thy mangled Limbs? And is This All that of my Child returns, To bless my Sight? Was it no more than This, For whose dear Sake all Hazards I endur'd Of Land, and Sea? At Me hurl all your Darts, Ye Rutuli; dispatch Me first; transfix My Breast; if any Pity dwells in Yours. Or Thou, great Sire of Gods, in Mercy strike To Hell with Thunder This devoted Head; Since 'tis not in the Pow'r of mighty Woe, Ev'n Woe like Mine, to burst This hated Life. The Trojans, pierc'd with These Laments and Tears, Groan thro' th'extended Host, and silent stand, Stupid with Grief, and heartless to the Fight. Her, aggravating That contagious Grief, Wide, spreading, Actor, and Idæus seize, (For so Ilioneus, and much distress'd Iülus, secretly had giv'n Command) And in their Arms convey her to the Tents. But the loud Trumpet's Brass with dire Alarm Sounds shrill from far: A thund'ring Shout succeeds; And Heav'n's high Vault rebellows to the Noise. The Volscians, by a Canopy of Shields Protected, forwards rush, prepare to fill The Trenches, and to level with the Plain The Bulwarks rais'd. Some, viewing round, explore The Passes; and attempt to scale the Walls, Where by thin Ranks less guarded they appear. The Trojans opposite, by lasting Siege Long since experienc'd in defensive War, Pour ev'ry Kind of Weapons, push them back With spiky Poles, and tumble from above Vast rocky Fragments of pernicious Weight; If possible to break the Roof of Shields, Which hides the Troop: Yet They all Dangers chuse Beneath their iron Tortoise to sustain. Not long: for where the thickest Globe of Foes Crouds to the Walls, the Trojans from their Works Roll down a Milstone of prodigious Size; Which crush'd the Rutuli, and far and wide Burst thro' the Cov'ring which their Armour form'd: Nor do the daring Rutuli persist In Fight conceal'd; but press with missive Darts To drive them from their Trenches. Dire to the Sight, and terrible in Rage, Mezentius from another Quarter waves A Tuscan Pine, and hurls the Smoke and Fire: But brave Messapus, of Neptunian Race, Tamer of Steeds, pierces the Rampart through, And calls for Ladders to ascend the Wall. You, Ye celestial Muses, aid my Song; And Thou, Calliope, the Chief, inspire Thy Poet: Say, what Slaughter Turnus made, What various Deaths and Ruin he dispens'd: Say, Who by Whom was sent to Pluto's Realm; And all the War's Extent revolve with Me. You suppliant I invoke; For You can best, Ye Goddesses, remember, and record. A Tow'r there stood, commodious, and aloft With Bridges rais'd; which all th'Italians strove With utmost Force and Efforts to o'erturn: To Them oppos'd the Trojans pour a Storm Of Stones, and thro' the Loopholes shoot their Darts. First Turnus in the Van a Firebrand threw, And fix'd the flaming Mischief to it's Side; Which, rising with the Wind, the Timber seiz'd, And, sticking to the Lintels, eat it's Way. Confus'd within They tremble; and in vain Attempt to fly the Ruin. While they throng Huddled in Heaps, and to That Part retire, Which from the Pest is free: Down sudden falls The Tow'r; And Heav'n all thunders with the Noise. Half dead, and follow'd by the pond'rous Load, With their own Weapons stab'd, and thro' their Breasts Transfix'd with splinter'd Wood, they roll to Earth. Scarce Lycus, and Helenor, from the Fall Alone unhurt, remain'd: Helenor first, And eldest born; whom to the Lydian King The Slave Lycimnia by a stol'n Embrace Bore, and in Arms forbidden sent to Troy, Light with his Sword unsheath'd, and with his Shield Inglorious, by no warlike Impress grac'd. Soon as himself he saw amidst the Troops Of Turnus, and by Thousands round inclos'd, This way and That the Latian Squadrons rang'd; As when a Stag, hem'd in on ev'ry side By Hunters, furious bounds against the Darts, And, sure of Death, leaps on the pointed Spears; So flings himself among the hostile Croud The desp'rate Youth, resolv'd, and bent to die, And, where he sees the thickest Arms, springs on. But Lycus, swifter, thro' the Foes and Darts Reaches the Walls by Flight, and strives to grasp A Turret, or some Friend's assisting Hand. Him Turnus, rushing, with a Spear pursues, And Victor Thus insults him: Couldst thou then, Dastard, and Fool, from Me too hope to fly? Then tugg'd him, hanging to the Battlements, And with a mighty Fragment of the Wall Drew him to Earth. As when the Bird of Jove Seizes a Hare, or snow-white Swan, aloft Born on his hooky Pounces: Or the Wolf Snatches a tender Youngling from the Fold, Sought with long Bleatings by it's careful Dam. Loud Shouts arise: They hurry to th'Attack; Some fill the Ditches; Others to the Top Hurl flaming Brands. Lucetius, underneath Approaching to the Gate, and bringing Fire, Sinks, with a broken Rock's huge Weight oppress'd By brave Ilioneus: Emathion falls By Lyger; Chorinæus by thy Hand, Asylas; By the Jav'lin That, and This By the deceiving Arrow sent from far. Cæneus Ortygius kills; then falls himself By Turnus: Itys He, and Clonius next, And Promulus, and Dioxippus kills, And Sagaris, and Idas, as he guards The lofty Tow'rs. Privernus to the Shades Dispatch'd by Capys dies, but wounded first By the light Jav'lin which Themillas threw: He thoughtless to the Wound his Hand applys, Dropping his Shield; the feather'd Shaft takes place, And nails his Left-hand to his Side, and splits The Bellows of his Breath that heav'd within. The Son of Arcens stood in burnish'd Arms Beauteous of Form, and gaudy in a Vest Of Needle-Broid'ry and Iberian Dye: Arcens, his Father, sent him to the War, Bred in the Grove of Mars, along the Stream Semethus, where Palichus' Altar stands Mild to it's Votarys, and fat with Blood: Mezentius quits his Arms, and round his Head Thrice whirls his sounding Sling; Shot from the Thong The Lead, half-melted, as it flies, divides His Temples, and extends him on the Sand. Here first, 'tis said, Ascanius in the War Hansel'd his Shafts, 'till Then on tim'rous Deer And Goats alone employ'd; and stretch'd on Earth Robust Numanus, Remulus surnam'd, To Turnus' younger Sister lately join'd In Wedlock. Of That new Alliance proud, In the first Van, with Petulance of Speech Vaunting aloud, with haughty Strides he stalk'd; And Thus insulting: Are you not asham'd, Twice captive Phrygians, to be still besieg'd? To lurk in Ditches, and oppose your Walls To Death? Behold the Champions, who presume By Force of Arms our Nuptials to demand. What God, what Madness drove you to These Coasts? No Sons of Atreus shall you here engage, No wily-tongu'd Ulysses; but a Race Ev'n from it's Infancy inur'd to Toils: We in the Rivers plunge our new-born Babes, And harden them in Frost, and icy Streams. Our Boys in Hunting vex the Woods, and tire The savage Beasts: With Them 'tis Children's Play To rein the Steed, and bend the twanging Bow. But patient of Fatigue, and train'd to live On little, with keen Shares our lusty Youth Subdue the Soil, or batter Towns with War. In Iron ev'ry Stage of Life we pass, And goad our Oxen with inverted Spears. Nor does the Clog of tardy Age abate The Vigour of our Minds, or damp our Fire. With Helmets ev'n our hoary Hair we press; And evermore delight to bear away Fresh daily Plunder, and by Rapine live. You, clad in shining Purple, and in Vests With long luxuriant Sleeves, indulge your Sloth; Dances are your Delight, and broider'd Robes; And Ribbands bind your Bonnets to your Chins. True Phrygian Women, (for no other Sex Can Phrygia boast) go, revel on the Top Of Dyndamus; Th'accustom'd Pipe's two Notes Invite you thither; And th'Idæan Box, And Mother Berecynthia's Cymbals call: Desist from Battles, and leave Arms to Men. Such Insolence of Words, such foul Reproach Ascanius could not bear; but with the Nerve Of Horses Hair full opposite he stood, Levell'd his Shaft, and diverse drew his Arms: And suppliant Thus to Jove his Vows address'd. Almighty Jove, assist my bold Design: My self with solemn Off'rings will enrich Thy Temple; and before thy Altars place A snow-white Steer, with gilded Horns, that bears His Head aloft, and, equal to his Dam, Already butts in Air, and spurns the Sand. Th'Almighty heard, and thunder'd to the left From a bright Quarter of the Sky: At once Sounded the fatal Eugh; With dreadful Hiss The Arrow flies, and fixes in the Head Of Remulus, and pierces with it's Steel His hollow Temples. Go now, and with Taunts Insult the Brave: Such Answers to the proud Rutulians the twice captive Phrygians send. No more Ascanius; But with loud Acclaim Th'exulting Trojans follow, rend the Sky With Shouts, and lift their Courage to the Stars. Apollo Then, with radiant Locks adorn'd, Sate on a Cloud, and from the Sky beheld The Trojan City, and th'Ausonian Host; Then to Iülus Victor Thus he spoke. Proceed in This new Courage, gen'rous Youth, Offspring of Gods, and destin'd Sire of Gods; 'Tis This way Mortals rise, and reach the Stars: Beneath Assaracus's Race, all Wars, Future by Fate, shall justly be compos'd: Nor Thee does Troy contain. This said, he slides From Heav'n, and dissipates the breathing Air; And tow'rds Ascanius comes, transform'd in Shape To ancient Butes, Armour-bearer once Of great Anchises, and a faithful Guard Before his Palace; by Æneas now Appointed on Ascanius to attend. Chang'd, like That aged Sire Apollo mov'd; Resembling Him all o'er, his Voice and Looks, His silver Hair, and dreadful sounding Arms; And Thus Iülus, with Heroic Fire Glowing, bespeaks. Brave Youth, Æneas' Son; Suffice it, that thy Shaft, Thy self unhurt, Has pierc'd Numanus: This First Praise to Thee Great Phœbus gives, nor envies thee the Fame Of his own Art in Arms: For what remains, Young Prince, decline the Fight. Thus having spoke, In his mid Speech abrupt he far withdrew From mortal Sight, and vanish'd into Air. The Trojan Nobles recogniz'd the God, Perceiv'd the Sound of his celestial Shafts, And heard his Quiver rattle in his Flight. Therefore Ascanius, greedy of the War, Yet aw'd by Phœbus' Warnings, they restrain: Themselves renew the Combate, and persist In utmost Peril to expose their Lives. A Shout thro' all the Works and Ramparts ran; Eager they bend their Bows, and whirl their Slings; The Ground all stuck with Darts, the hollow Casques And Targets in the Shock of Conflict ring: A rigid Fight ensues. As from the West And rainy Kids a turbid Storm descends, And beats the Ground; or thick with rattling Hail Tumbles precipitant into the Sea: When Jove tempestuous whirls the wintry Show'r With Winds aloft, and bursts the bellying Clouds. Bitias, and Pandarus, on Ida's Top Sprung from Alcanor, Youths of mighty Size, Whom rough Hiera, in the Wood of Jove, Tall as their Country's Pines and Mountains, bore, Open the Gate, which by their Chiefs Command To Them was giv'n; and confident in Arms Invite the Enemy into their Walls. Themselves, within, on either side stand arm'd To guard the Fort, and tow'r with plumy Crests: Like two aërial Oaks, which near the Stream Of pleasant Adige, or the Banks of Po, Rise in the Sky, uplifting to the Clouds Their unshorn Heads, and nod sublime in Air. The Rutuli break in, as they perceive The open Gates: Strait Quercens, and in Arms Beauteous Equicolus, and Tmarus rash Of Soul, and Hæmon brave, or turn their Backs With all their Troops, precipitate in Flight; Or in the Gates first Entrance leave their Lives. Then hostile Fire with fiercer Fury burns; And now the Trojans, in one Band conglob'd, Dare in Excursions, and a closer Fight. To Turnus, while in diff'rent Parts he storms, And scatters Death, a Message is convey'd, That now the Foes had open flung their Gates, And with fresh Slaughter rag'd. He quits abrupt His former Enterprize; and, rous'd with Ire Enormous, rushes to the Trojan Gate, Eager the haughty Brothers to engage; And first Antiphates (for He the first Himself presented) by a stol'n Embrace Conceiv'd, and of a Theban Mother born To high Sarpedon, with a Jav'lin hurl'd He strikes to Earth: Swift flies th'Italian Ash Thro' the thin Air, and in his Stomach fix'd Lies deep beneath his Breast; A frothing Flood From the black gaping Orifice he pours, And in his Entrails warms the pointed Steel. Then Merops, Erymanth, Aphidnus next He fells; Then Bitias, ardent in his Eyes, And terrible in Rage; not with a Spear; No Spear could reach his Life; but like a Bolt Of darted Lightning, shot with mighty Force, And roaring Noise, a pond'rous Jav'lin came; Which nor the two Bull-Hides, nor Corslet, lin'd With double Plates of scaly Brass, and Gold, Could intercept: Down falls his Giant Trunk, And monstrous Limbs; The Earth beneath him groans, And his broad Target thunders on the Field. As when upon Eubœan Baiæ's Shore A stony Pile sinks down; which on the Sea With massy Rocks was built: So prone it falls With Ruin vast, and tumbles on the Flats Among the dashing Waves; The Surges rise And to the Surface hurl the mingled Sand: High Prochyta roars trembling at the Noise, And tall Inarime's hard flinty Bed, By Jove's Command on huge Typhœus thrown. Here Mars adds Courage to the Latian Host, Supplies new Strength, and goads their Breasts to War; But to the Trojans sends pale Fear, and Flight. They gather round, since Room for Fight is giv'n; And all the God of Arms into their Souls Himself infuses. When Pandarus beheld his Brother slain, And saw the State and Fortune of Affairs; With mighty Force exerted at the Gate He plies his Shoulders broad, and turns the Hinge, And many of his Friends excluded leaves In the rough Toil of Mars, without the Walls; But others rushing, with himself, shuts in: Fool, who perceiv'd not the Rutulian Chief Pressing amidst the Croud, and in the Town Included him, like a fierce Tyger pent Among the tim'rous Cattle in a Fold. Forthwith new Fire burns sparkling in his Eyes; With dreadful Clank his shining Armour rings; High on his Crest the bloody-colour'd Plumes Tremble; and Lightning flashes from his Shield. The Trojans, struck with sudden Fear, soon know That hated Visage, and Those mighty Limbs. Huge Pandarus springs on; and, fir'd with Rage Vindictive for his Brother's Death, Thus speaks. 'Tis not Amata's Palace giv'n in Dow'r To Turnus, nor his native Ardea's Walls, That here inclose him; Hostile Tents thou seest, And all Egress prohibited. To Him Thus Turnus smiling, and sedate replies. Begin then, and engage; if aught there dwell Of Courage in That Breast: Thou shalt relate To Priam, that a new Achilles here Thou hast experienc'd. Thus the Hero spoke; The Other, all his Strength collecting, hurls A Jav'lin rough with Knots, and green with Bark: The Air receives the Wound; The flying Spear, By Juno interposing turn'd aside, Errs from the Mark, and fixes in the Gate. Not so the Weapon wielded by This Hand Thou shalt escape: For diff'rent is the Force Which wields the Weapon, and inflicts the Wound. He said; And, rising to his lifted Sword, Between his Temples with the Blade divides His middle Front; and with a Wound immense Cuts sheer, and separates his beardless Cheeks. With Noise he falls, and pond'rous shakes the Ground; And his dead Limbs, and Armour smear'd with Brains Extends on Earth: His Head on either side In equal Parts on either Shoulder hangs. The trembling Trojans turn their Backs in Flight: And had the Victor, at That Point of Time, Bethought him to unlock the Bolts, and Bars, And thro' the open Gate admit his Friends; To the whole War, and all the Trojan Name That Day had been the Last: But burning Rage, And th'unextinguish'd Appetite of Blood Drove him against the Foe. First Phalaris intrepid he invades, And ham-string'd Gyges; Snatching his swift Darts, He plies their Backs, and urges them in Flight: Juno infuses Strength, and warlike Fire. Halys, and Phegeus with his Shield transfix'd, To These he adds; Noëmon, Prytanis, And Halius, and Alcander, on the Walls, Unknowing, and engag'd in other Fight. Lynceus, advancing opposite in Arms, And calling on his Friends, with brandish'd Sword From the high Mound he, to the Right, assails; At one full Stroke off flew his gasping Head, And, with his Helmet, at a distance lay. Then Amycus, who Forest-Beasts among Wide Havock made: More skill'd was none to tinge The Jav'lin, and with Poison arm the Steel. Next Clytius, Son of Æölus; with Him Creteus the Muses' Friend: In num'rous Verse Was his Delight, in Lutes, and tuneful Strings: Horses, and Arms, and Wars, were all his Song. At length the Trojan Chiefs, Serestus brave, And Mnestheus, when the Enemy they saw Within their City, and their Friends distress'd, So many slaughter'd, others turn'd in Flight; Advance to animate their fainting Troops. Then Mnestheus; Whither, whither would you fly, O Citizens? What other Fort is Yours, What other Walls, to which you may retire? Shall with Impunity one single Man, And He too pent within your Ramparts, spread So terrible a Slaughter thro' the Town? And send so many of our bravest Youth To Shades below? Dwells Nothing in your Breasts Of Shame, and Pity for unhappy Troy, For great Æneas, and your ancient Gods? Fir'd by such Words, their Courage they resume; And in one firm compacted Body stand. Turnus, retreating, from the Fight withdraws By slow Degrees; and to That Part retires, Which by the ambient River's Stream is wash'd: The more the shouting Trojans urge him close, And thickning onwards rush. As when a Band Of Hunters press and goar with pointed Spears A savage Lion; He appal'd gives way, With Aspect stern, and makes a sour Retreat: Courage and Rage permit him not to turn His Back; nor does his Strength suffice to leap (Tho' fain he would) against the Darts, and Foes: So Turnus backward with slow Paces moves, Dubious of Thought, and all with Fury burns. Ev'n Then the Centre of the hostile Troops He twice attack'd, twice drove them on the Walls Confus'd in hasty Flight. But all at once On Him alone their Forces from the Tents United press: And now no longer dares Saturnian Juno to supply him Strength; For airy Iris, from the Sky dispatch'd By Jove, harsh Mandates to his Sister bore, If Turnus from the lofty Trojan Walls Receded not. He therefore, with his Shield, And Arms, unable to support the Shock, Stands panting, with such Storms of Darts o'erwhelm'd On ev'ry side: His hollow Temples round With oft repeated Blows his Helmet rings, Batter'd with Stones, and flatten'd to his Head; It's Crest struck off; Nor does his Target's Orb Suffice against the Strokes: The Trojans thick, With thund'ring Mnestheus at their Head, push on; Then Sweat in Rivers o'er his Body flows; He faints with Toil, and stagg'ring gasps for Breath; And the vast Labour shakes his weary Limbs. At length into the River's yellow Waves, Plunging himself, he leaps with all his Arms: The gentle Stream receives him, as he falls, In it's soft Lap; and, washing off the Blood, Wafts him exulting to rejoin his Friends. The End of the Ninth Book. BOOK the Tenth. Olympus' Palace wide, mean-while, unfolds It's everlasting Doors: The King of Gods Summons a Council in the starry Hall; From whence, enthron'd on high, all Lands he views, The Latin Nations, and the Trojan Camp: Th'Ethereal Synod meets; Himself begins. Ye mighty Pow'rs of Heav'n, What backward turns Your Purpose? And with disagreeing Schemes Why Thus contend you? I forbade all War Between the Trojans, and th'Ausonian States: Against my Interdiction whence arose New Discord? What Mistrust, or Fear prevail'd On either Nation to engage in Arms? A Time will come (forestall it not) for Fight Sufficient; when fierce Carthage, thro' the Alps Cutting it's Way, shall pour upon the Plains, And threaten Ruin to the Roman Tow'rs. Their Rage and Rapine let them Then indulge: Permit them Now in Amity to join With glad Accord, and ratify the Peace. Thus Jove in brief: But not in brief reply'd Bright Venus. O Sov'reign Pow'r, O Sire of Men, and Gods, (For now what Other Pow'r can we implore?) Seest thou th'insulting Rutuli? the Pride Of Turnus? how elated with Success Thro' the mid Troops, sublime, he drives his Steeds? Their very Ramparts now no more protect The Trojans; Ev'n within their Gates, and Walls The Battle rages; and their Trenches foam With Tides of Gore. Æneas ignorant Is absent: Shall they never be reliev'd By your Permission? but be still besieg'd? The Foes again are hov'ring round the Walls Of Infant Troy; Another Army form'd; And from Ætolian Arpi, Foe to Troy, Again Tydides rises to the War: Belike, new Wounds from Him I must expect; And Your own Offspring bleed by mortal Arms. If unpermitted by your Sov'reign Will The Trojans landed on th'Italian Coasts; Be They the Suff'rers, and your Aid deny'd. But if so many Oracles Divine They follow'd, These from Heav'n, and Those from Hell; Why Now by any Pow'r are Schemes oppos'd To your Decrees? And why new Fates ordain'd? Why should I name the Fleet destroy'd by Fire On Eryx' Coast? The Winds, the Tempest rais'd By Æolus? Or Iris sent from Heav'n? Now too th'Infernal Deities (That World Alone was unsollicited) she moves; And from the Stygian Shades Alecto sent Amidst th'Italian Towns, licentious, raves. No more for Empire are my Thoughts concern'd; While Fortune was, on That we durst presume: Be Those the Victors, whom your Will decrees. If to the Trojans o'er the World remains No Land, which Your hard Consort will allow; Yet, Father, by the Smoke of ruin'd Troy You I conjure, permit me to dismiss Ascanius from the War; permit to live My Grandson: Let Æneas ('tis his Fate) Still wander, still be toss'd on Waves unknown, And whate'er Course his Fortune shews pursue: Be it indulg'd me to protect That Youth, And skreen him from the rigid Toils of War. Cythera, Paphos, and th'Idalian Seat, And Amathus are Mine: There, quite withdrawn From Arms, inglorious let him waste his Days: With unresisted Sway, by your Command, Let Carthage press Ausonia; And from thence No Rival to the Tyrian Cities rise. What boots it now the Trojans, that they 'scap'd The Pest of War amidst the Grecian Fires; And such a long Variety of Woes By Land, and Sea exhausted; while they seek A Seat in Latium, and new rising Troy? Had it not more avail'd them to have rais'd New Mansions on the Ruins of the Old; On their lov'd Country's Ashes, and the Soil Where Troy once stood? Give, Father, I implore, Xanthus, and Simoïs, to them restor'd; And let the wretched Trojans prove revolv'd The Fates of Troy. Then, inly stung with Rage, Imperial Juno spoke. Why Thus compel'd By Thee, my long deep Silence must I break, In open Words at last divulge my Wrongs, And give the struggling Indignation Vent? What Mortal, or what Pow'r Celestial forc'd Æneas to present himself a Foe To King Latinus, and engage in War? Latium he sought, 'tis granted, urg'd by Fate, Urg'd by Cassandra's Frenzy: When, or how Did I advise him to forsake his Camp, And to the Winds and Waves his Life expose? Did I advise him with a Boy to trust His Ramparts, and the Stress of all the War? To seek th'Alliance of the Tuscan Bands, And ruffle quiet Nations with Alarms? What God to These false Measures urg'd him on? What rigid Pow'r of Mine? What part in This Did Juno act? Or Iris sent from Heav'n? 'Tis most injurious that th'Italian Troops Should wrap the Walls of Infant Troy in Flames; Unjust that Turnus, of Celestial Race, (Pilumnus, and Venilia gave him Birth) In his own Native Soil should fix his Seat. What Name must brand the Trojans, who presum'd With lawless Force the Latins to invade? T'enthral, and plunder Kingdoms not their own? By Rapine to espouse unwilling Brides, Torn from the Bosoms of their plighted Lords? To sue for Peace, and arm their Ships for War? You rescu'd from the Greeks your darling Son, (Such is Your Pow'r) and in Æneas' stead Could substitute a Cloud, and empty Air; And to as many Nymphs his Ships transform: For Us 'tis criminal in aught to aid The Rutuli. Æneas ignorant Is absent: Ignorant, and absent still Let him remain. Idalia's Seat is Yours, And pleasant Paphos, and the stately Dome Of high Cythera. Why shouldst thou provoke Rough hardy Souls, a City big with Wars? Was Mine th'Attempt to crush the sinking State Of Phrygia? Mine? Or Hers, who to the Greeks Expos'd the wretched Trojans? For what Cause Did Europe's Pow'rs and Asia's rise in Arms, By Crimes clandestine, and dissolve the Peace? Did I conduct th'Adulterer of Troy To ravage Sparta? Did I give him Arms? Or with his lawless Lust foment the War? Then was Thy Season for These Mother's Fears; Now with unjust Complaints thy idle Rage Rises ill-tim'd, and bandys Brawls in vain. Thus Juno spoke; And all the Heav'nly Pow'rs Murmur'd with various, and confus'd Assent: As when the first soft Breezes thro' the Woods, Included, tremble, and hoarse Whispers roll, Boding to Máriners approaching Winds. Th'Almighty Father then, Supreme of Kings, Resumes Speech intermitted: (While He speaks, Heav'n's lofty Court keeps silence, and the Earth Trembles below, th'Ethereal Arch above; The Winds all hush'd, th'unruffled Sea subsides:) Hear then, and in your Minds imprint my Words: Since Troy and Latium cannot now unite In Peace, and your Contentions know no End; Whatever Fortune is This day decreed, Whatever Hope by Each is entertain'd; Or Trojan, or Rutulian let Him be, Without Distinction I shall Both regard: Whether the Trojans by th'Italian Fates, Or, ill advis'd, by Errour of their own Are strait besieg'd. Nor from Their Share of Toils Do I exempt the Rutuli: Let Each Abide th'Event, and Fortune of his Deeds; Jove is the Same, one common King to All: The Fates will find a Way. So spake the God; And by his Stygian Brother's pitchy Banks, And whirling Torrent, ratify'd the Doom; And all Olympus trembled at his Nod. Here ended the Debate: Imperial Jove Uprises from his Throne of Gold; The Gods Attend him to his Palace, round inclos'd. Meanwhile the Rutuli thro' all the Gates Persist, with mighty Slaughter wide diffus'd, To press the Foes, and wrap the Town in Flames. The Trojans, in their Trenches close besieg'd, (No Prospect of Escape) dejected stand On their high Tow'rs, and thinly man the Walls. Asius Imbrasides, Thymætes, Son Of Hycetaon, both th'Assaraci, And Tybris, senior now, with Castor join'd, Stand the chief Leaders. These from Lycia's Height Clarus, and Hæmon follow; Brothers both To great Sarpedon. Equal to his Sire, And Brother, in Heroic Deeds of Arms, (Mnestheus his Brother, Clytius was his Sire) Lyrnessian Acmon, all his Body's force Exerting, throws a vast unwieldy Rock, No small Part of a Mountain. These with Darts Strive to defend their Ramparts; Those, with Stones; And scatter Fire, and fit their level'd Shafts. Full in the Midst the Princely Youth of Troy By Venus lov'd, and worthy all her Care, (His beauteous Head uncover'd) shone to View: As shines a Gem inclos'd in yellow Gold, Grace to the Head, or Neck; or Iv'ry set, With curious Art, in Ebony, or Box: His snowy Neck receives his flowing Hair, Clasp'd in a Circle of soft ductile Gold. Thee too, Mæonian Ismarus, in Fight The warlike Nations saw dispensing Wounds, And arming Darts with Poison; Thee, of Race Illustrious born; where fertil Glebe they till; And rich Pactolus waters it with Gold. There Mnesteus fought, exalted with the Fame Of Turnus, from the Walls so late repuls'd; And Capys, who Campania's City nam'd. While These in mutual Conflict fierce engag'd; Æneas in deep Midnight plough'd the Waves. For when, from King Evander, he arriv'd, With sure Credentials, in the Tuscan Camp; Address'd the Gen'ral, told his Name, and Birth; What he desir'd, and what himself propos'd; What Arms Mezentius added to his own; Told him th'impetuous Insolence and Rage Of Turnus; And reminded him how vain Is Trust in human Strength; With Reasons urg'd Mingling Intreaties: No Delay is made; Tarchon unites his Pow'rs, and strikes a League. And now, commission'd by the Gods and Fate, Under the Conduct of a foreign Chief, The Lydians man their Fleet, and stem the Deep. First sails th'Æneian Vessel; to it's Beak The Phrygian Lions added: And above Ida stands imminent, safe Harbour once, And Refuge to the exil'd Sons of Troy. Here great Æneas sits; and in his Breast Revolves the various Hazards of the War: And Pallas, join'd to his left side, enquires Oft of the Stars, which guide their nightly Course; Oft of his Toils by Land and Sea sustain'd. Now open Helicon, and Songs inspire, Celestial Muses; Say, what Pow'rs in Arms Follow'd Æneas from the Tuscan Coasts, And mann'd their warlike Ships, and plough'd the Sea. First Massicus his beaky Tyger steers, And cuts the Waves: A thousand warlike Youths Obey his Orders; who from Clusium's Walls And Cosa's City came: Their Weapons, Shafts; Light Quivers at their Backs, and deadly Bows. With These rough Abas sail'd: In burnish'd Arms His Troops all shone; Apollo cast in Gold Brightning his Stern; To Him six hundred Youths Expert in War their Populonia gave; Ilva three hundred, Island fam'd for Mines Of inexhausted Steel. Asylas Third, Interpreter of Men and Gods; whose Skill The Victim's Fibres, and the Stars obey, And Tongues of Birds, and Lightnings from the Clouds Flashing Presages: He a Thousand leads Thicken'd for Fight, and throng'd with rigid Spears. These by Alphæan Pisæ, Tuscan Town, To Him were giv'n. Next beauteous Astur sails, Astur confiding in his Steed, and Arms Of various Colour. Those who Cære's Walls, And Minio's Fields inhabit, and with Them The ancient Pyrgi, and Graviscæ, known For Air unwholesome, add three hundred more, Unanimous to follow to the Fight. Nor, Cycnus, Thee in Silence would I pass, Thou bravest Leader of Ligurian Blood; Nor Thee, Cupavo, follow'd but by few: On whose high Crest a Swan's white Feathers rise. Love was your Crime, and on your graven Shields The Impress of your Metamorphos'd Sire. For Fame reports, that Cycnus, worn with Grief For much lov'd Phaëton's unhappy Fate, While with sad Songs he sooth'd his fond Despair, Among the Poplar Boughs, his Sister's Shades, Contracted downy Plumes, and hoary Age; Abandon'd Earth, and singing sought the Stars. His Son, amidst his Equals in the Fleet, The mighty Centaur with strong Oars impels; He o'er the Waves stands imminent, and aims (Threatning aloft) a Rock's vast Weight to throw, And with his long-built Vessel ploughs the Deep. Next from his Native Soil fam'd Ocnus leads His Squadron: Him, the Tuscan River's Son, Prophetick Manto bore: His Mother's Name, Mantua, to Thee he gave, and built Thy Walls; Mantua, for high Progenitors renown'd: Yet from One Race not all her Sons descend; Three are her Tribes; Four Towns to Each; Herself The Queen of All: From Tuscan Blood her Pow'r. Five hundred Warriours more Mezentius arms Against himself: Whom, crown'd with azure Reeds, Mincius, who from Benacus rolls his Stream, Wafted with hostile Ships into the Sea. These stern Auletes leads; and rising high Buffets the Billows with an hundred Oars; The Sea turn'd upwards froths beneath the Strokes. Him the vast Triton bears, and with his Conch Frights the green Waves: His shaggy upper Parts, Down to his Sides, a human Shape express; His Belly in a Pristis ends: The Sea Murmurs and foams beneath the Monster's Breast. So many chosen Chiefs, in Thirty Ships, Bore Aid to Troy, and plough'd the briny Fields. 'Twas now the Noon of Night; And Phœbe's Car In it's mid Course had reach'd Olympus' Height: Æneas (for his Care no Rest allows) Sitting on Deck, himself the Rudder guides, And shifts the Sails. When, lo! the Virgin Quire Of his own Nymphs, to Nymphs from Ships transform'd, To whom propitious Cybele had giv'n A Deity in Ocean, met their Chief In his mid Voyage: Rang'd together swam As many Goddesses, and cut the Waves. As stood before tall Vessels on the Beach. They know their Prince from far; and in a Ring Inclose him round: Of whom Cymodoce In Speech the happiest, rising to her Waist, Above the Ocean, grasps the Stern behind With her Right hand; (her Left, as Oar, divides The silent Waves:) and Him, unknowing, Thus Addresses. Wak'st thou, Offspring of the Gods, Æneas? Wake, and loose thy flying Sails. We, Sea-Nymphs now, were once Thy Fleet, the Pines Which grew on Ida's sacred Top. When press'd By faithless Turnus with the Sword, and Fire, Compel'd we burst thy Cables; and Thee sought O'er the vast Deep. The Mother of the Gods, Commiserating, This new Form bestow'd; And gave us to be Goddesses, and live Immortal underneath the Ocean's Waves. But young Ascanius in the Walls and Mounds Is now confin'd; amidst the hostile Darts, And Latins all with Martial Terrours arm'd. Th'Arcadian Horse, with the brave Tuscans join'd, Have reach'd the Place assign'd them: With his Troops Turnus resolves to intercept their March, And frustrate their Attempt to join the Camp. Rise Thou, and first, when dawning Morn appears, Command th'associate Nations to their Arms: And take thy bright unconquerable Shield, Which Vulcan wrought, and border'd round with Gold. To-morrow's Sun (if aught my Words can find Of Credit) shall behold vast slaughter'd Heaps Of Rutuli. She said; and with her Hand, At Parting, in That Motion not unskill'd, Push'd the tall Vessel: She, more swift than Winds, Or darted Jav'lin, flys along the Waves. The rest then speed their Course: The Chief himself, Anchises' Son, in Ignorance admires; Yet, by the Omen rais'd, to Heav'n uplifts His Eyes, and Thus in brief prefers his Pray'r. Propitious Mother of the Pow'rs Divine, Idæan Goddess; in high Dyndamus Delighting, and in lofty Citys proud With Tow'rs, and Lions harness'd to thy Car: Thee now I follow in the War; Do Thou Confirm This Augury, and aid Thy Troy. He said: And now returning Day roll'd on, And with it's full-born Light dispell'd the Shades. First he commands his Follow'rs to attend The Signal giv'n; to animate, to arm Their Courage; and prepare themselves for Fight. The Trojans now, and his own Camp he views, High on the Deck; Then waves his blazing Shield In his Left Hand extended. From the Walls The Trojans raise a Shout which rends the Sky; New Hope enflames their Rage; And Show'rs of Darts They hurl: As when, beneath the dusky Clouds, Strymonian Cranes the wonted Signal give With sounding Pinions; cut the liquid Air, With joyful Clang, and leave the Storms behind. Amaz'd stood Turnus, and th'Ausonian Chiefs; Till, looking back, they saw the Navy move Cov'ring the Sea, and gliding make to Shore. Fierce burns his Helm; and from his tow'ring Crest Flame flashes; and his Shield's round Bossy Gold Vomits vast Fires. As when in Night serene, Ensanguin'd Comets shoot a dismal Glare: Or the red Dog-Star, rising on the World, To wretched Mortals threatens Dearth, and Plagues, With baleful Light; and saddens all the Sky. But, nought dismay'd, bold Turnus bends his Thoughts First to possess the Beach, and from the Shore Repel them. With these Words he chides, and fires His Friends: What long you wish'd is now arriv'd, To crush your Foes; All Mars is in your Hands: Be Each now mindful of his Spouse, and Home; Now emulate your great Forefathers' Fame, And imitate their Actions. Let us run Aggressors; and attack them, as they land In Hurry and Disorder; while their Feet First slide with tott'ring Steps upon the Beach. Fortune assists the Brave. He said; and ponder'd in his Thoughts, what Force To lead against th'Invaders, and with whom To trust the Siege. Mean-while, with Bridges laid From the tall Ships, Æneas lands his Troops: Some watch the Ebbings of the shallow Sea, And, leaping, to the Fords themselves commit; Others by Oars. Tarchon observes the Strand, Where Shelves he fears not, nor the dashing Waves Remurmur; but the Sea with swelling Tide Unbroken flows: He turns his Prows to Land, And Thus exhorts his Mates. Now, chosen Youths, Bend to your sturdy Oars: Urge on, impel Your Vessels; Cut, and cleave This hostile Ground With their keen brazen Beaks; Let ev'n our Ships Furrow the Soil: Be Mine ev'n stranded here; Shipwreck it self, if snatching Land at once, I'd not refuse. When Tarchon Thus had spoke, His Crew industrious ply their Oars, and drive Their foaming Vessels to th'Ausonian Coast; 'Till on dry Land they rest: All safe, but Thine, O Tarchon: For while, sticking in the Flats, Long on a hard unequal Ridge she hangs, Doubtful, and pois'd, and tires the beating Waves; She bulges stav'd, and pours into the Deep The Crew expos'd: The Fragments of the Oars And floating Planks encumber them, in vain Making to Shore; And the retreating Tide Supplants their Feet, and bears them back to Sea. Turnus delays not; but with rapid March Against the Trojans all his Squadron leads, And stands, oppos'd in Arms, upon the Shore. The Signal sounds: Æneas first invades (Omen of prosp'rous Fight) the Rustick Troops, And fells the Latins. Theron first he slew, Of mighty Bulk, who durst in Fight assail Æneas: Thro' his complicated Brass, And golden tissu'd Corslet, with his Sword Deep bury'd, he exhausts his open Side. Next Lycas; who, from his dead Mother ript, To Thee, Apollo, was an Off'ring vow'd; Because, an Infant, from the sharpen'd Steel He was preserv'd. Not far from Him remote The hardy Cisseus he extends in Death, And monstrous Gyas, beating down with Clubs Th'embattled Squadrons. Them not aught avail'd Alcides' Arms, nor their own Force in War, Nor yet their Sire Melampus, Follow'r once Of Hercules, when earthly Toils he bore. 'Gainst Pharus, insolent with Coward Taunts, He hurls a Spear; which in his clam'rous Mouth Stands fix'd. Thou too hadst sunk beneath his Arm, Unhappy Cydon; while thy new Delight Clytius Thou didst pursue, the blooming Boy, Just yellow with soft Down: Thou too hadst fall'n, Regardless of thy execrable Loves; Had not thy Band of Brothers, Phorcus' Sons, Sev'n Youths, oppos'd his Might: Sev'n Darts they threw; Some from his Shield and Helmet vain rebound; Some raze his Flesh: But Venus puts them by. Æneas then Achates Thus bespeaks: Supply me Darts; (Not One shall fly in vain Against the Rutuli:) Those Darts, which drank So much of Grecian Blood in Trojan Fields. Then grasps at once, and whirls a mighty Spear; Which flying passes thro' the brazen Shield Of Mæon; and his Corslet, and his Breast At once divides. Alcanor runs to aid His Brother; and supports him, as he falls, With his Right Hand: Another Jav'lin flies, Bores his Right Arm, and cuts it's bloody Way; And from his Shoulder by the stringy Nerves The dying Limb hangs down. Then Numitor The Jav'lin from his Brother's Body draws, And darts it at the Trojan Chief: From Him It errs, and razes great Achates' Thigh. Here Clausus, trusting in his Sabine Pow'rs, And his own Youth, advances to the Fight; Wounds Dryops with a rigid Spear, from far, Beneath his Chin with mighty Force impress'd; Pierces his Throat, and, while he speaks, at once Of Voice, and Soul bereaves him: With his Front He knocks the Ground, and vomits clotted Gore. Three Thracians too, from Boreas' distant Clime, And Three, whom Ismarus and Idas sent, (Idas their Father, Ismarus the Soil Which gave them Birth) by various Chance he kills. Halesus meets him, and th'Auruncan Bands, And Neptune's Son Messapus, with his Steeds Proud and conspicuous. With their utmost force Now These, now Those, in Conflict, strive to push Each other from their Ground: Ev'n on the Brink Of Latium in fierce Combate they contend. As when the Winds, with equal Strength, and Rage, Discordant, in the spacious Sky raise War; Nor Winds, nor Clouds, nor Waves, on either Side, Yielding give way; long doubtful hangs the Fight; All struggling 'gainst each other press adverse: So Troy's and Latium's Squadrons grappling strive, Foot fix'd to Foot, and Man to Man oppos'd. But in a diff'rent Part, where whirling Stones The Torrent toll'd along, and Trees uptorn From either Bank; th'Arcadian Troops, unus'd On Foot to combate, by the pressing Foes O'erpower'd gave way; the Nature of the Soil Compelling them, on craggy Ground, to quit Their Steeds: Them turn'd in Flight when Pallas saw, Now with Intreatis (for That sole Resource In such Distress was left) now with Rebukes And keen Upbraidings he excites their Fire. Ah! whither fly you? By your selves, my Friends, And your brave Deeds, by King Evander's Name, And Conquests gain'd in War, by my own Hopes Which burn to emulate my Father's Praise; Trust not to Flight: A Passage thro' the Foes Must with the Sword be hewn; where thickest crouds That Globe of Troops: That way Your selves, and Me, Pallas your Chief, our Country's Glory calls. No Gods oppose us; By a mortal Foe Mortals our selves are urg'd: As many Lives And Hands are Ours, as Theirs: Behold the Sea Confines us here; No Land remains for Flight: To Troy shall we repair? or stem the Deep? This said, against the thickest of the Foes He bounds into the Midst: Whom Lagus first, By his ill Fate directed, obvious meets, Him, as he tugs a Stone of monstrous Weight, With a hurl'd Dart he pierces, where the Ribs Are sever'd by the intermediate Chine; And from the Bones draws back the sticking Spear. Him stooping Hisbon hop'd to strike; but fail'd In That Attempt: For Pallas, as he rush'd, And rag'd, uncautious, for his slaughter'd Friend, Surpriz'd; and deep within his heaving Lungs Bury'd his Sword. Then Helenus he stabs; And Him who durst pollute his Step-dame's Bed, Anchemolus, of Rhætus' ancient Race. You too, extended on Rutulian Plains, Twin Brothers, Thymber, and Larides fell, Offspring of Daucus, One in Looks, and Mien; Whom undistinguish'd ev'n your Parents view'd, With the sweet Errour pleas'd: But Pallas' Sword A dire Distinction to your Persons gave. For Thymber, from thy Trunk th'Evandrian Blade Sever'd the Head; And thy Right Hand lopt off, Larides, sought it's Lord; The Fingers move, Quiv'ring in Death, and strive to grasp the Steel. Th'Arcadians, by their Chief's Reproaches fir'd, And seeing his Heroic Deeds, rush arm'd, With Shame and Indignation, on the Foe. Pallas transfixes Rhæteus, as he flies Beyond him, in his Car; Just so much Space Of Life, the more, to Ilus was allow'd. For He at Ilus aim'd his Dart from far; Which Rhæteus intercepts, as Thee he flies, Brave Teuthras, and thy Brother Tyres: Roll'd From his high Car he spurns th'Ausonian Fields. As when the wish'd-for Winds in Summer rise, Thro' the thick Woods the Shepherd scatters Fire; The middle Trees blaze sudden, and at once Vulcan's dire Squadrons deluge all the Plains: He, pleas'd, sits viewing the triumphant Flames. So to thy Succour, Pallas, all thy Troops Rush in one Band conglob'd: But brave in War Halesus moves against the hostile Croud; And in his Armour all himself contracts. Ladon, and Pheres, and Demodocus He strait dispatches: With his shining Sword From brave Strymonius his Right hand he hews, Rais'd to his Throat: 'Gainst Thoas' Face a Stone He dashes, and indents his Bones commix'd With Brains and Blood. Halesus' Sire, the Fates Foretelling, had conceal'd him in the Groves: But when the Senior clos'd his Eyes in Death; Fate seiz'd its Own, and to Evander's Darts Consign'd him. Pallas now attempts his Life; But first to Tyber Thus prefers his Pray'r. Grant, Father, to the Jav'lin, which I wield, Success, to fly thro' stern Halesus' Breast: His Arms and Spoils shall on thy Oak be hung. This heard the God: Halesus, while he skreen'd Imaon, turn'd, ill-fated as he was, His Breast unarm'd, to meet th'Arcadian Dart. But Lausus, no small Portion of the War, Permits not by so great a Champion's Death His Troops to be dismay'd: Oppos'd in Arms Abas, the Knot and Bulwark of the Fight, He kills the first: Arcadia's Offspring falls; The Tuscans fall; and You, Ye Sons of Troy, Whom Greece could not consume. The Troops engage With equal Leaders, and with equal Strength: The outmost Ranks close press the thicken'd War; Nor does the Croud permit their Hands, or Darts To move: Here Pallas pushes, Lausus There; But little diff'rent was their Age; and Both Of beauteous Form: To neither Fortune gave Ever to see his Native Country more. Yet Jove permits them not to meet in Fight: Each from a greater Foe his Fate attends. Mean-while his Sister to King Turnus' Thoughts Suggested, that to Lausus' present Aid He should advance. While He, with swift Career Cutting the middle Ranks, his Friends beheld; Desist You from the Battle, and retire: Pallas I meet alone; To Me alone Pallas is due: O! were his Father here Spectator of the Fight. He said; His Friends Form the commanded List, and clear the Field. At their Retreat, and at Those proud Commands, The Royal Youth, in Wonder, and Amaze, Stands fix'd on Turnus; rolls his Eyes around, And with stern Aspect his huge Bulk surveys. Then to th'insulting Chief These Words returns: Or I This day will reap the Fame of Spoils Illustrious won, or of a glorious Death; For either Chance my Father stands prepar'd: Forbear thy Threats. This said, he takes the Field; The chill Blood curdles round th'Arcadians' Hearts: Turnus his Chariot quits; on Foot prepares For closer Fight. As When a Lion spys From a high Rock a Bull upon the Plain, Standing aloof, and meditating War; Forward he springs: Not diff'rent was the Port Of Turnus, and his Figure, as he walk'd. When Pallas thought within his Jav'lin's Reach His Foe advanc'd; He first begins th'Assault With Strength not justly match'd, to try if aught Fortune would favour an Attempt so bold; And Thus to Heav'n's wide Arch directs his Pray'r. Alcides, by Those hospitable Boards Which once, my Father's Guest, thou didst approach, Thee I implore, assist my great Design: Let Turnus, gasping, by my Hand behold The bloody Armour from his Body torn; And own me Victor with his dying Eyes. Alcides heard the Youth; beneath his Breast Choak'd a big Groan, and fruitless Tears let fall. Then Thus th'Almighty Sire consol'd his Son. Fix'd stands the Date of Mortal Lives; The Space Is short, and irretrievable to All: But by their Actions to extend their Fame, Is Virtue's Task. Beneath Troy's lofty Walls So many Sons of Gods in Battle fell; Ev'n my own Race Sarpedon there expir'd. Turnus his Fate too waits: And to the Verge Of his allotted Time his Life rolls on. He said; And turn'd his Eyes from Latium's Fields. But Pallas with vast Strength a Jav'lin hurls; And from it's Scabbard draws his shining Sword. On his high Shoulder lights the flying Spear; And, passing thro' the Shield's extremest Edge, The Body of great Turnus slightly raz'd. Turnus a Lance prefix'd with sharpen'd Steel Long poising, darts it, and Thus speaks; Now see Whether our Weapon can more deeply wound. He said; And, driv'n with forceful Swing from far, Thro' the mid Shield, so many Plates of Brass, So many Iron-Folds, and tough Bull-Hides, The Jav'lin makes it's Way; and pierces sheer The Corslet's Mail, and bores his mighty Breast. He wrenches out the reeking Point in vain; Thro' the same Orifice the Blood, and Soul Issue at once: He falls upon his Wound; His Armour o'er him rings; With gory Mouth He gasps in Death, and bites the hostile Plain. Then o'er him Turnus speaks: Arcadians, to Evander (mark my Words) This Message bear; Just such as he deserv'd To be restor'd, his Pallas I restore. The Honour of a Tomb, whate'er it be, And all the Solace which a Grave can yield, I frankly give: Yet dearly has he bought His Trojan Guest's Alliance. Having spoke, With his left Foot the breathless Corps he press'd; Snatching with eager haste the pond'rous Belt, And on it That dire Argument engrav'd, So many Youths in one connubial Night Dispatch'd, and bridal Beds besmear'd with Gore; Which good Eurytion's Art had carv'd in Gold: This Trophy now, with recent Conquest crown'd, Turnus enjoys, and in proud Triumph wears. Dark to Futurity, and blind in Fate Are Mortal Minds; indocile to observe Due Measure, when elated with Success. A Time will come, when Turnus from his Soul Shall wish young Pallas by his Hand untouch'd; And hate Those Spoils, and That Victorious Day. But Pallas, by his Friends, with Groans, and Tears, Born on a Shield, is to the Camp convey'd; O Grief, and Glory to thy aged Sire, Illustrious Youth! Thus fated to return! This was thy first, and last of Days in War: Yet Heaps of slaughter'd Foes thou leav'st in Death. And now Æneas, not by Rumour spred, But by undoubted Tidings, is inform'd Of such a dire Disaster; That his Friends Saw but small Space betwixt Themselves and Death: That now 'twas Time with Succours to relieve The flying Trojans. With his Sword he fells Whatever near him stands; and thro' the Troops, Burning with Vengeance, mows a Passage wide; Thee, Turnus, Thee with recent Slaughter proud, He seeks: Evander, Pallas, and the Boards Which he, the first, a welcome Guest approach'd, And his new plighted Faith, all stand in View Before his Eyes. Four Youths of Sulmo's Race, As many bred by Ufens, Victims doom'd, Living he snatches, Victims to the Ghost Of Pallas; with their captive Blood to drench His Fun'ral-Pile, and on it's Flames expire. At Magus then he aims a Spear from far: Artful he stoops; The Jav'lin o'er his Head Flies quiv'ring: With his Hands the Hero's Knees He close embraces, and Thus suppliant speaks. Thee, by thy Father's Manes, I implore, And by Iülus' rising Hopes, preserve This Life; O spare my Sire, and Son in Me: A stately House I have, and hid in Earth Talents of graven Silver, and a Mass, A pond'rous Mass, of wrought, and unwrought Gold. The Trojan Conquest turns not on my Blood; Nor can one Life so great a Diff'rence make. He spoke; and Thus the Trojan Chief reply'd. The Mass thou nam'st of Silver and of Gold Save for thy Children; Turnus first destroy'd That Traffick of the War, when Pallas fell: This thinks Iülus, This Anchises' Ghost. He said; and, as he pray'd, his Helmet seiz'd With his Left hand, and twisting back his Head Plung'd to the Hilt his Fauchion in his Side. Not far was Trivia's and Apollo's Priest, Æmonides; A Mitre wreath'd his Hair With holy Fillets; In a sumptuous Garb, And rich conspicuous Arms, he shone all o'er. Him thro' the Field the Trojan Chief pursues; Stands o'er him fall'n, a Victim to his Rage, And covers him with Death's thick Shade: His Arms Serestus from his breathless Body strips, A Trophy destin'd to Thee, God of War. From Vulcan's Lineage Cæculus deriv'd, And Umbro from the Marsian Mountains sent, Renew the Fight: Æneas storms, oppos'd; Anxur's Left hand, and his whole Target's Orb With his keen Blade at once he strikes to Earth. He much had boasted, and believ'd his Vaunt Of force to crown his Wishes; and perhaps, His Hopes to Heav'n exalting, to Himself Had promis'd hoary Hairs, and Length of Age. Next Tarquitus, whom beauteous Dryope, Nymph of the Groves, to Sylvan Faunus bore, Proud in bright Armour, to the raging Chief Obvious himself presents. With his long Spear He bores his Corslet, and his cumb'rous Shield: Him praying, and a thousand Things to say In vain attempting, on the Ground he rolls; Lops off his Head, and o'er his weltring Trunk With keen Invective Thus insulting speaks. Lie there now, Chief redoubted; With a Grave, By thy fond Mother, in thy Native Soil, Thy Corps shall not be grac'd: To Birds of Prey Thou shalt be left; Or in the Ocean's Waves Be roll'd; and hungry Fishes lick thy Wounds. Antæus next, and Lycas he invades; The choicest Chiefs who Turnus' Squadrons led; And valiant Numa; yellow Camers next, Brave Volscens' Son: The richest Lord was He In fertil Glebe of all th'Ausonian Kings, And o'er Amyclæ's silent Nation reign'd. Like huge Ægeon, with an hundred Arms, (So Fame reports) and with an hundred Hands, From fifty Mouths and Breasts expiring Flames; Against Jove's Thunderbolts as many Shields Clashing, and brandishing as many Swords: Like Him o'er all the Field Æneas storm'd Victor, when once his Steel grew warm with Blood. Against Niphæus' Breast oppos'd in Fight, And his four Steeds which harness'd drew his Car, He next advances: Whom when they beheld Raging from far, and terrible in Arms; Startled they fled, o'erturn'd their prostrate Lord, And whirl'd the rapid Chariot to the Shore. Then Lucagus, by two white Coursers drawn, Drives thro' the middle Squadrons; and with Him Liger his Brother: Liger guides the Reins; Fierce Lucagus his glitt'ring Fauchion wheels. Them raging with such Violence of Fire The Trojan Prince endur'd not: Swift he rush'd, And with his Lance adverse sublime appear'd. To whom Thus Liger: Tydides' Chariot, or Achilles' Steeds, And Phrygia's Fields thou seest not: On This Earth At once shall end thy Battles, and thy Life. Such Insolence of Words from Liger flew; But not with Words the Trojan Prince reply'd: For full against the Foe his Lance he hurl'd. As Lucagus prone, hanging on the Blow, Goads with a Dart his Horses, and prepares, With his Left Foot protended, for the Fight; Beneath the Border of his shining Shield The Spear takes place, and pierces his left Groin: He from his Chariot dying rolls to Earth. Whom good Æneas Thus with bitter Taunt Bespeaks, insulting: Lucagus, These Steeds Thy Car betray'd not, tardy in their Flight; Nor Fantoms vain misled thee from the Foe: Thy self, inglorious, leaping from the Seat, Thy Chariot hast deserted. Having spoke, He seiz'd the Steeds. From the same Chariot fall'n, Th'unhappy Brother stretch'd his Hands disarm'd: Brave Trojan, by Thy self, by Those who gave So great a Leader Birth, permit This Life; And pity me imploring. More he pray'd; But Thus Æneas: Not such Words e'erwhile You utter'd: Die; and, as a Brother should, Accompany your Brother. Then his Breast, The Soul's dark Lodging, with his Sword he bores. Such Slaughter thro' the Field the Trojan Chief Spreads, like a Whirlwind, or a torrent Flood, Raging around: At length, so long besieg'd In vain, Ascanius, and the Trojan Youth Their Trenches quit, and sally from the Town. Mean-while great Jove to Juno Thus address'd: O Thou, to Me by two the closest Ties So much endear'd, my Sister, and my Wife; Venus, as you suppos'd, (nor has That Thought Erroneous prov'd) supports the Trojan Pow'rs: Nought have the Men themselves of Courage, nought Of Vigour in the War, no Fire, nor Minds Patient of Danger, and inur'd to Toils. To whom Saturnia with dejected Eyes: Why thus perplex you, O my honour'd Lord, My Soul already anxious, and with Dread Trembling at your Severity of Speech? Had now my Love That Int'rest in your Breast, Which once it had, and justly had; This Boon To me th'Omnipotent would not deny; That Turnus from the Field I might withdraw, And to his Father Daunus safe restore. Now let him die, and with his pious Blood Satiate the Trojan Vengeance. Yet his Race Descends from Ours; and in the fourth Degree Pilumnus is his Sire: And He himself Has oft with lavish Hand your Altars crown'd. To whom in brief th'Almighty King reply'd: If what you ask for This devoted Youth Be to defer his present Death, and add An Interval of Life; and if you think My Pow'r so far extends; by Flight preserve Turnus, and snatch him from impending Fate. Thus much we may indulge: But if your Pray'r Supposes aught still farther in Reserve; If you conceive th'Event of all the War Can be revers'd; on airy Hopes you feed. To whom Thus Juno weeping: What, if That Which ev'n in Words you now refuse to grant, Were by the Purpose of your Soul decreed, And Length of Life to Turnus stood confirm'd? Now a hard Fate attends the guiltless Youth; Or I with Fears ungrounded am deceiv'd: O may I prove That Errour; and your Thoughts (You want not Pow'r) to better Counsels bend. Thus having spoke, she speeds her sudden Flight, Wrap'd in a Whirlwind, from Olympus' Tow'r, Down to the Trojan, and Laurentian Hosts; And drives a Storm before her thro' the Air. Then (wondrous to behold!) the Goddess arms A Visionary Fantom, light, and vain, From a thin Cloud, chang'd to Æneas' Shape; Decks it with Trojan Darts; his Shield, and Crest, And all the Honours of his God-like Head Dissembles; gives it empty Words, and Sound; And forms it's Steps, and Manner, as it walks. Such Figures, as 'tis said, departed Ghosts Flutt'ring assume; or mimic Dreams by Night. In the first Van th'exulting Shade provokes The Hero, and with Darts, and Voice defies. Turnus advances fierce; and hurls from far A whistling Lance; The recreant Spectre flies: When Turnus thought Æneas from the Fight Retiring; and, in Turbulence of Soul Confus'd, imaginary Hopes devour'd: Where fly'st thou? Stay Æneas, nor desert Thy plighted Nuptials: This Right hand shall fix Thy Mansion sought so long o'er Ocean's Waves. Thus vaunting he pursues, and whirls his Sword, Nor sees his Triumphs fleeting in the Wind. Close to the Covert of a lofty Rock A Ship by chance there stood, with Ladders hung, And Bridges laid; which King Osinius bore From Clusium's Coast. To This, with hasty Steps, The trembling Image of Æneas flies, And in it's Hatches lurks. With Haste no less Turnus pursues, all Obstacles surmounts, And passes o'er the Bridges: When the Deck He scarce had reach'd; Saturnia bursts the Cords, And speeds the Vessel thro' the rolling Deep. Him absent, o'er the Field, Æneas seeks For Combate; many to the Shades below Obvious he sends. And now the mimic Form No longer lurks conceal'd; but mounts in Air Aloft, and mingles with a dusky Cloud: While Turnus in mid Ocean wafted sails. Unknowing of his Safety, and ingrate In Ignorance, he backward bends his Eyes; And both his Hands uplifting to the Stars, Thus speaks. Almighty Father, couldst thou deem Me fit in such a Crime to be involv'd, And so severe a Penance to endure? Whence came I? Whither am I hurry'd? How, Or What shall I return? Or how behold Laurentum's City, and th'Ausonian Camp? How shall I be reproach'd, how justly scorn'd By Those brave Youths who to my Arms adher'd? All whom (O Shame and Guilt!) in Death's Extremes I have abandon'd? Them ev'n now I see Straggling in Flight, and hear their dying Groans. What shall I do? O may the Earth to me Yawning disclose a Grave! Or You, ye Winds, You rather pity me, your willing Prey: Turnus implores you, drive the splitting Ship On Rocks, or plunge it in the gulphy Sands: Whither the Rutuli, and conscious Fame May not pursue me. Speaking thus, he shifts His wav'ring Thoughts, and fluctuates in his Cares; Whether, for such Dishonour, he should plunge The rigid Steel into his Breast; or leap Into the Waves, and swimming seek the Shore, And rush again amidst the Trojan Arms. Both ways he thrice attempts; as oft restrain'd By mighty Juno, pitying his Distress: With prosp'rous Gale and Tide he cuts the Deep, And at his Father Daunus' Walls arrives. But by Jove's Impulse fierce Mezentius fir'd Mean-while succeeds to Battle; and invades The conqu'ring Trojans. All the Tyrrhene Bands Assemble: Him alone with mortal Hate United, and with Storms of Darts they press. He, like a Rock, which o'er the Ocean wide Hangs prominent, expos'd to Winds and Waves, And all the Rage of Sea, and Sky endures; Stands fix'd, unmov'd. First Dolichaon's Son Heber he strikes to Earth; then Latagus, And flying Palmus. But the Face adverse Of Latagus he dashes with a Stone, The pond'rous Fragment of a massy Cliff; Palmus he leaves to roll upon the Ground, Hamstring'd and fall'n: His Arms and Crest he gives To Lausus, in proud Triumph to be worn. Then Phrygian Evas falls beneath his Arm: And Mimas, the Compeer and equal Friend Of Paris; whom to Amycus his Sire Theano bore, in That same fatal Night, When Cisseus' Daughter, teeming with a Torch, Gave Paris Birth: Within his Native Walls He fell; in Latium Mimas lies unknown. As when a mighty Boar, by baying Hounds Driv'n from the Mountain's Height, (who many Years Harbour'd on piny Vesulus has fed, Or in Laurentum's Lake, and marshy Grove;) Soon as among the Toils he is arriv'd, Makes a sour Stand, and foaming storms, and rears The stiffning Horrours of his bristly Chine: None durst with near Approach provoke the Fight; With Jav'lins thrown from far, and Clamours safe They ply him: He intrepid ev'ry Pass Attempts, and from his Shoulders shakes the Darts; Whetting his Tusks, and unresolv'd in Rage. So none of These, incens'd with just Revenge Against Mezentius, dare with Weapons drawn Engage in closer Fight; with missile Darts, And Clamours loud, they urge him press'd from far. Leaving his destin'd Hymenéal Rites Came Grecian Acron, from the ancient Realms Of Coritus. Him when Mezentius saw, Breaking the middle Ranks, with purple Plumes, And the gay Favours of his plighted Bride Conspicuous, proud: As when a Lion, pinch'd With raging Hunger, ranges round the Stalls; If chance he spy a tim'rous Goat, or Deer Lofty with branching Horns; he yawns o'erjoy'd With vast expanded Jaws, erects his Mane, Sticks to the Prey, and lies upon it press'd Close to the Ground; Black Gore, besmearing, laves His savage Mouth: So glad Mezentius rushes on the Foes; Unhappy Acron falls, with quiv'ring Feet Knocks the black Ground, and sobs his Soul away, And steeps the broken Weapon in his Blood. Orodes, flying, with a darted Spear He deigns not to pursue, nor with a Wound Unseen to fell him: Obvious, and adverse He meets him, and opposes Man to Man; Less skill'd in Stratagem, than brave in Arms. Then pressing with his Foot his Body fall'n, And resting on his Lance; Behold, my Friends, Sublime Orodes, of the War no Part Contemptible, lies here: His Friends with Shouts Triumphant follow, and applaud their Chief. Then He expiring; Long, whoe'er thou art, And o'er me unreveng'd, thou shalt not vaunt, Proud Victor: Thee the same allotted Fates Expect, and These same Fields thy Corps shall press. To whom Mezentius with malignant Smile: Die Thou; Of Me let Heav'n's great King dispose. Then wrenches out the Dart: A deadly Rest, And iron Slumber seals his heavy Eyes, And closes them in everlasting Night. Sacrator stabs Hydaspes; Cædicus Alcathous: Rapo Parthenius kills, And hardy Orses. By Massapus falls Clonius, and Lycaonian Erycetes; The first from his unmanag'd flound'ring Steed Tumbled to Earth, the last on foot assail'd. But Lycian Agis to the Fight advanc'd; Whom, not degen'rate from his Grandsire's Worth Brave Valerus extends upon the Ground. Salius Atronius kills; and falls Himself By fam'd Nealces, skill'd to hurl the Dart, And the deceiving Arrow sent from far. Now unrelenting Mars, on either Side, Equal'd the Slaughter, and the mutual Deaths; The Victors, and the Vanquish'd kill, and rush With equal Force: Nor These, nor Those retreat. The Gods in Jove's high Court with Pity view The Rage of Mortals, and their fruitless Toils. Here Venus sits Spectator, Juno There: And pale Tisiphone amidst the Troops Of Thousands storms. But turbulent in Ire, With his long Spear Mezentius takes the Field; Huge as Orion, when on foot he stalks, Cutting his Way thro' the wide liquid Realms Of Nereus, and surmounts the topmost Waves With Shoulders tall: Or when, an aged Oak Transporting from the Hills, upon the Ground He walks, and hides his Head among the Clouds. So in vast Arms Mezentius tow'rs sublime: Thro' the long Ranks when him Æneas spys; To meet him he prepares: The Other fix'd And fearless waits, expecting the Approach Of his brave Foe; and in his own Bulk stands. Then having measur'd with his Eyes the Space Fit for his Jav'lin's Reach; Assist me now, My own Right hand, and Thou, my missive Lance; You are the only Gods that I invoke: Lausus, thy self I vow the Trophy deck'd With Spoils from This false Trojan Pirate torn. He said; and hurl'd the hissing Dart from far: Which flying glances from the Target's Orb; And 'twixt the Side and Belly fixes deep In fam'd Anthores: Who, from Argos sent, And once Companion of Alcides' Toils, Had to the King Evander's Arms adher'd; And in a Latian City chose his Seat. He falls, unhappy, by Another's Wound; With dying Eyes views the last Light of Heav'n, And on his much-lov'd Argos thinks in Death. Then good Æneas throws a Spear; which flys Swift thro' the hollow Orb of triple Brass, Thro' the tough Linen Folds, and three Bulls Hides Convolv'd: The Point stands fix'd within his Groin; But spends it's Force, too short to reach his Life. Æneas, glad to see the Tuscan's Blood, Snatches his Fauchion from his Thigh with Haste, And darts impetuous on his trembling Foe. This Lausus saw; and struck with Fear, and Grief, For his lov'd Father by such Danger press'd, Groan'd deep; and Tears ran trickling down his Cheeks. Here thy Heroick Deeds, and rigid Fate In Death, brave pious Youth (if future Times To so renown'd an Act will Credit yield) Shall not by me in silence be suppress'd. The Sire, retreating, useless for the Fight, And with his Wound disabled, back withdrew; And in his Target trail'd the hostile Spear. The Youth springs on amidst the thickest Arms, Himself opposing to Æneas' Sword Rais'd high, and ready to discharge the Blow; And for a time sustains his Shock: His Friends Follow with loud Acclaim, and Jav'lins fling, 'Till shelter'd by the Target of his Son The Father had retir'd; and push the Foe, And bear him back with Darts: Æneas storms Adverse, and in his Shield contracted stands. As when a Tempest, thick with patt'ring Hail, Precipitate descends; from all the Fields. Flys ev'ry Traveller, and lab'ring Hind For Shelter safe, or to a River's Bank, Or to the Hollow of a lofty Rock; There hide secure, while pour'd upon the Earth The Tempest rages: 'till the Sun restor'd Permits them to renew the Toils of Day. So, with thick Darts on ev'ry side o'erwhelm'd, Æneas all the Storm of War sustains: And chides young Lausus, and Thus threatning speaks. Fond Youth, why rushest thou on certain Death, Daring beyond thy Strength, and tender Years? Thy Piety deceives thee. Not the less He, desperate, provokes and braves his Foe; And now the Trojan Leader's Fury, rais'd To it's full Height, boils terrible; The Fates Spin the last Thread for Lausus: While he vaunts, Æneas plunges all the mighty Sword Quite thro' the Middle of his Body driv'n; Which pierc'd his thin light Shield, and broider'd Vest, Wrought by his Mother with soft Threads of Gold. The Blood his Bosom fills; and to the Shades His Soul flys sad, and murmurs thro' the Air. But when Anchises' Son his Visage saw, His Visage wond'rous pale, and chang'd in Death; Deeply he groan'd with Pity, and his Hand Extended, as he fell; And to his Thoughts The Image soft of filial Piety It self presented. What, ill-fated Youth, What Honours, by such mighty Virtue claim'd, To thy Deserts can good Æneas pay? The Arms, which pleas'd thee living, still be Thine; And to thy Parents' Manes, and their Dust (If aught That Care sollicit thee in Death) Thy breathless Corps I willingly restore. And let This Thought console thy rigid Doom; By great Æneas' Hand thou fall'st. At once He chides his lingring Friends; and from the Ground Uplifts him, with his Tresses, form'd by Art, All foul in Dust, and clung with clotted Gore. Mean-while the Sire, repos'd near Tyber's Stream, With Water rins'd his Wounds, and eas'd his Limbs, Reclin'd against an Oak. Upon the Boughs His brazen Helmet at a distance hung; And on the Mead his pond'rous Armour lay. Round stand the chosen Youth: He, faint with Toil, Supports his Neck, and smooths his waving Beard. Of Lausus much enquires; and many sends His anxious Father's Mandates to convey, And bring him from the Battle. But his Friends, Weeping, upon a Shield dead Lausus bear, Mighty, and with a mighty Wound subdu'd. His Soul, prophetick of disastrous Chance, Well knows the distant Groan: With Dust he soils His hoary Hair, and stretches both his Hands To Heav'n; and clinging hugs the bloody Coarse. And was I then, my Son, so fond of Life; That I should suffer Him, whose Life I gave, For me t'oppose himself against the Foe? Am I thy Father by thy Wounds preserv'd, Thus living by thy Death? Ah! now indeed I feel my wretched Exile: Now the Stab Smarts, deep inflicted. By Tyrannick Rage Driv'n from my Sceptres, and my Father's Throne, Thy Fame, my Son, I sully'd with my Crimes: 'Twas just that I by ev'ry Kind of Death Should pay the Forfeit of my guilty Life, Due to my Country, and my Subjects' Hate. Yet still I live, and bear This odious Light; But will not long. This said, himself he rais'd Prop'd on his halting Thigh: And, tho' the Pain Of his deep Wound retards him, not dismay'd He bids them bring his Steed, his Pride, Delight, And Solace in all Wars; On him from all With Victory he still return'd: His Lord Bespeaks him mourning, and These Words lets fall. Rhœbus, We long have liv'd; if aught there be To Mortals long: Or Thou this day shalt bring Those bloody Trophys, and Æneas' Head; And Victor prove with me of Lausus' Death The joint Avenger: Or, if no Resource Be left for Valour, Thou with me shalt fall: For, gen'rous Beast, thou wilt, I rest assur'd, No foreign Lord, or Trojan Burthen bear. This said, the Courser on his Back receives Th'accustom'd Load: He settles in the Seat; And both his Hands with pointed Jav'lins fills: His brazen Helmet glitters on his Head; And nods the waving Crest of Horses Mane. Thus arm'd, with rapid Haste into the Midst Furious he rides: Within his Bosom boils Disdainful Shame, and Grief to Madness wrought, And Love inflam'd with Rage, and conscious Worth. Here on Æneas thrice he calls aloud: Æneas knows him, and Thus joyful prays. So may the mighty Father of the Gods, And high Apollo grant; may'st thou begin T'engage in Fight. He said; and obvious with his Spear advanc'd. Then Thus Mezentius: Why, malicious Foe, Think'st thou to fright me, after Lausus' Death? Me by That only Wound thou couldst destroy. Death, and the Gods I equally despise: Forbear; I came to die: But first receive These Greetings from my Hand. He said, and hurl'd A Dart against the Foe: Then, flying round In Circuit wide, another Spear he throws, Another, and another after That: But the big golden Orb sustains them All. Thrice to the left he wheel'd his Steed in Rings About the standing Chief, and Jav'lins threw: And thrice the Trojan Hero bore around The iron Grove fix'd in his brazen Shield. At length, impatient of so long Delay, Weary'd with wrenching out so many Darts, Urg'd to unequal Fight, and pond'ring much In Thought, he springs to Vengeance; and between The hollow Temples of the warriour Steed Lances his Spear. The sprightly Beast erect Uprears himself in Air, and with his Hoofs Buffets the Wind: Then, following with his Weight To Earth, incumbers his dismounted Lord, And floundring on his prostrate Shoulder lies. The Trojans, and the Latins rend the Sky With deaf'ning Noise: Æneas rushes on, And from his Scabbard draws the shining Sword; Then Thus: Where now is fierce Mezentius? Where That Fury of a Soul? To whom, his Eyes Uplifting, and recov'ring Breath, and Sense, The Tuscan Thus reply'd: Why, bitter Foe, Dost thou insult, and menace Death? My Blood Is due to Thee, and spilt without a Crime: On other Terms I came not to the War; Nor did my Lausus for his Sire with Thee Make other Contract. One thing I implore, (If aught of Grace remain for vanquish'd Foes) Permit my Corps to be interr'd: I know The Malice of my Subjects hovers round; Forbid That Outrage: Let me share a Grave, Join'd to my Son, and rest with Him in Death. This said; He in his Throat at once receives Th'expected Blade; and in a Flood of Gore On his bright Armour pours his gushing Soul. The End of the Tenth Book. BOOK the Eleventh. Mean-while Aurora rising leaves the Sea: Æneas (tho' th'Interment of his Friends Hurrys his Thoughts, with Fun'ral-Cares perplex'd) With the first Dawn of Morning, Victor pays His Vows to Heav'n. He plants upon a Hill An Oak of mighty Bulk, on ev'ry side Shorn of it's Boughs; and all with shining Arms, The Spoils of King Mezentius, clothes the Trunk: A Trophy rais'd, great Warriour God, to Thee. He fits the bloody Crest, and broken Darts, And plated Corslet with twelve Wounds transfix'd; On the left side his brazen Buckler hangs, And from his Neck his iv'ry-hilted Sword. Then to his shouting Friends (for all the Chiefs, Crouding, inclose him round) he Thus begins. Great is, my Friends, th'Advantage here obtain'd; Henceforth all Fear be banish'd: See the Spoils Of That proud King, the First-fruits of the War; And by my Sword Thus here Mezentius stands. Now to the King Latinus, and his Walls We march: Prepare your Courage, and your Arms; And in your Hopes anticipate the Fight. Let no Delay (when first we shall unfix Our Standards by Permission of the Gods, And draw our Youth embattled from their Tents) Nor any Apprehension, Doubt, or Fear Retard you ignorant. Let us mean-while Commit to Earth our yet unbury'd Friends; (The only Honour we to Ghosts can pay:) Go, with the last sad Rites, officious, grace Th'illustrious Dead, who purchas'd with their Blood This Realm for Us: And to Evander's Walls With mournful Pomp let Pallas first be sent: Whom, not deficient in Heroic Fire, And well-try'd Worth, the fatal Day cut off, And in a Fun'ral immature involv'd. Weeping he spoke; and to That Tent repair'd Where lay the breathless Corps of Pallas, watch'd By old Acætes, Armour-bearer once To King Evander; now, but not with like Success, the Guardian of his darling Son. The Band of all th'Attendants, and a Croud Of Trojans, and with Tresses scatter'd loose (Such is th'accustom'd Rite) the Trojan Dames Stand round: But when beneath the lofty Roof Æneas enter'd; to the Stars they raise A gen'ral Groan aloud, and beat their Breasts; And all with Shrieks the high Pavilion rings. Himself, when he beheld the bolster'd Head Of beauteous Pallas, and his snowy Hue, And from th'Ausonian Spear the gaping Wound In his smooth Breast, Thus spoke with rising Tears. Did Fortune then, Thou much-lamented Youth, Tho' first propitious, envy me thy Life? That my establish'd Realm thou should'st not see, Nor Victor to thy Father's Palace ride? Not so of Thee I promis'd to thy Sire Evander; when, at parting, he embrac'd, And sent me to wide Empire, and with Fear Warn'd me, that with a Nation fierce and rough We must engage. And now perhaps, with Hope Delusive greatly flatter'd, He with Vows Invokes the Gods, and on their Altars piles Oblations: We the Youth now rob'd of Breath, Nor longer subject to the Pow'rs above, Weeping, with unavailing Honours grace. Thy Son's untimely Fun'ral thou shalt see, Unhappy! Is This then my wish'd Return? These my expected Triumphs? This my Hope? Yet Him, Evander, shalt thou not behold Pierc'd with dishonest Wounds; nor wish thy own Sad Fun'ral, for thy Son's inglorious Life: Ah me! how great a Champion hast Thou lost, Ausonia! Thou, Iülus, what a Friend! Thus having wept, he bids them bear away The cold lamented Coarse; and from his Troops, Assembled all, a thousand Men selects, On the last mournful Honours to attend, And with his Father's Tears to join their own: Small Consolation for such mighty Woe; Yet due in Justice to the hapless Sire. Others a soft light Bier, with quick Dispatch, Of Oaken Twigs, and twisted Osiers weave; And cover with an Arch of bending Boughs The high-rais'd Bed. There the dear Youth they lay Sublime on verdant Leaves; Like some fair Flow'r, Soft Violet, or languid Hyacinth, Crop'd by a Virgin's Hand: Whose beauteous Gloss Still blooms unfaded; tho' the Parent Earth Moist Nutriment, and Strength no more supplys. Two broider'd purple Vests Æneas brings; Which for Himself, with That sweet Labour pleas'd, With her own Hands Sidonian Dido wove, And wrought the vary'd Silk with Threads of Gold. In One of These he wraps the breathless Youth; (The last sad Honour!) with the Other veils His muffled Hair devoted to the Flames. Then copious Spoils, the rich Rewards of War, Gain'd in Laurentian Fields, he piles on Heaps, And in long Order bids the Pillage move: Adds Steeds, and Darts, from Foes in Battle won; And Victims, with cramp'd Hands behind them bound, Doom'd with their Blood the Manes to appease, And tinge the fun'ral Fires. The Chiefs themselves, Commanded, bear the Trunks with hostile Arms All cover'd, and with hostile Names inscrib'd. Acætes, with the Load of Age, and Grief, Bending, moves slow, supported on each side; Now knocks his Breast, now tears his wither'd Cheeks, And faint, and prostrate, grovels on the Ground. The Chariots in Procession follow next, Smear'd with Rutulian Blood: Behind them, stripp'd Of his rich Trappings, goes the warriour Steed, Æthon; and big round Drops roll down his Face. Some bear his Lance, and Helmet; For the rest Turnus, proud Victor, keeps: The mourning Troop Succeeds; The Trojan, and the Tyrrhene Chiefs, And, with inverted Spears, th'Arcadian Train. When all the solemn Pomp had pass'd along; Æneas stood, and Thus, deep groaning cry'd: Me the same Fates of unrelenting War Summon from These to other Fun'ral Tears; Eternally Farewel, illustrious Prince, Great Pallas, ever honour'd, ever mourn'd; Hail, and Farewel. This said, He turn'd his Steps, Sought the high Walls, and to the Tents repair'd. And now from King Latinus' Court arriv'd Ambassadors, with Olive-Branches wreath'd, And Grace imploring; that he would permit The Corps, which slain in Battle, o'er the Field Lay scatter'd, to be quietly interr'd: War with the Dead he wag'd not; Let him spare A Nation, once by hospitable Tyes, And plighted Spousals, to Himself ally'd. Them good Æneas, and their Suit so just, Receives with gracious Air; and Thus proceeds. What Fortune, unpropitious, undeserv'd, Plung'd you, Ye Latins, in so deep a War, And urg'd you from our Friendship to decline? Peace for the Dead desire you? for the Corps Which fell in Battle by the Chance of Arms? Peace to the Living gladly would I grant. I came not hither but by Fate's Decree; Nor with th'Ausonian Nation make I War. Your King the Bond of our Alliance broke; And rather chose to trust in Turnus' Arms. Just had it been, that Turnus to This Death Himself should have expos'd: If he prepar'd By Force to end the War, and from These Coasts To drive the Trojans; Him it had became With Me in equal Combate to engage. Or He, or I had liv'd; on whom the Gods, Or his own conqu'ring Hand, had Life bestow'd. Go You; and grace your Friends, in Battle slain, With the last Rites, and fire their Fun'ral-Piles. He ceas'd: They all in silent Wonder stood; And on each other, gazing, turn'd their Eyes: Then aged Drances, with invet'rate Spight Against young Turnus irritated, speaks. O great in Fame, but far more great in Arms, Brave Trojan Chief; What Praises shall I chuse To equal Thee with Heav'n? What shall I first Admire? Thy Justice? Or thy Deeds in War? We to our City, grateful, will convey Thy Words, and Thee to King Latinus join; If any Fortune second our Attempt: Let Turnus seek Alliances elsewhere. Our selves with Pleasure will assist to raise The destin'd Tow'rs; and on our Shoulders bear The future Walls of new reviving Troy. He said; They all unanimous assent In Murmurs. For twelve Days they fix the Truce; And, by it's Arbitration, o'er the Woods The Trojans and the Latins mingled rove In Safety: On the Hills the lofty Ashe With Axes sounds: and Pines which reach the Stars They roll from Mountains; nor with Wedges cease Hard Oak, and smelling Cedar to divide, Nor Firs on groaning Waggons to convey. But flying Fame, which not long since pronounc'd Young Pallas Victor on th'Ausonian Plains, Now, Messenger of such o'erwhelming Woe, Evander, and Evander's Palace fills, And all his City. Thronging to the Gates Th'Arcadians rush; and by th'accustom'd Rite Snatch fun'ral Torches. In long Order rang'd A Train of Flames illumines all the Road, And far and wide discriminates the Fields. To meet That sad Procession, slow advance The Trojan Troops, and join their wailing Friends. Them when th'Arcadian Matrons saw arriv'd Within the Walls; with Shrieks and loud Laments Repeated all the frantick City rings. But King Evander by no friendly Force Could be restrain'd: Distracted thro' the Midst He rushes; falls on Pallas' breathless Corps Stretch'd on the standing Bier, and clinging close Hugs him with Groans and Tears: At length his Words, Long choak'd with Grief, a painful Passage found. Not such, O Pallas, was thy Promise giv'n To thy unhappy Sire; that with Reserve, And Caution, thou would'st trust the bloody Field: And well I knew, in the first Feats of Arms How much young Glory, and sweet Fame could do. O dire First-fruits of War, ill-fated Youth! Mournful Beginnings! and my Pray'rs and Vows Unheard by all the Pow'rs Divine! And Thou, Celestial Saint, dear Partner of my Bed, Bless'd in thy Death! nor to This Woe reserv'd! I by a disproportion'd Length of Life Usurp on Nature, and survive my Son. Me, to the Trojan Arms Confed'rate join'd, The Rutuli with Darts should have o'erwhelm'd: I should have breath'd my last: And Me, This Pomp, Not Pallas, to my Walls should have convey'd. Nor You, Ye Trojans, aught would I accuse; Nor our Alliance, nor our plighted Faith. This Fate was due to my expiring Age: And since This Death untimely to my Son Was destin'd; 'Tis some Solace that he fell Leading the Trojans to the Latian Plains, And first his Thousands of the Volscians slew. Nor Thee with other Fun'ral would I grace, O Pallas, than with That which is assign'd By good Æneas the brave Sons of Troy, The Tyrrhene Chiefs, and all the Tyrrhene Bands. Large Trophies Those have yielded, who by Thee In Battle fell: Now too Thy bulky Trunk, O Turnus, should be rais'd aloft in Arms; Were He, or I of equal Strength, and Age. But why unhappy with These fond Complaints Detain I thus the Trojans from the War? Go; and These Mandates to your Prince convey. That after Pallas' Death I here protract A hated Life, Thy Valour is the Cause; From which, thou seest, the Father and the Son Expect the Blood of Turnus justly due: This only Thou and Fortune can confer. I seek no Joys of Life; nor is it just: But wish to bear Those Tidings to my Son, And chear his Ghost among the Shades below. Mean-while Aurora, with new rising Light, Restor'd the Cares and Labours of the Day To wretched Mortals. On the winding Shore, By Prince Æneas, and by Tarchon rais'd, The Fun'ral-Piles stand thick: By ancient Rite All hither bring the Bodies of their Friends, And lay them on the Fires; whose smouldring Smoke Ascends in Wreaths, and darkens all the Sky. Thrice the tall blazing Piles, and dusky Flames They round encompass; Those on Foot, and These High on their Steeds, all clad in shining Arms; And loud Laments, and piercing Clamours raise. The trickling Tears bedew the Earth below, And down their Armour run: To Heav'n ascend The Trumpet's Clangor, and the Cries of Men. Some fling the Spoils, from slaughter'd Latins torn, Into the Flames; Helmets, and burnish'd Swords, And Reins, and fervid Wheels: Some add to These Gifts better known, which by the Dead Themselves Were worn, their Shields, and Not successful Darts. Then num'rous Oxen, bristly Swine, and Sheep, Choice Victims, snatch'd from all the Fields around, They sacrifice, and stab them on the Fires. O'er all the Shore they watch their burning Friends; Nor from the smoking Dust can be withdrawn, 'Till dewy Night inverts the Hemisphere, And spangles o'er the Face of Heav'n with Stars. Nor less, in diff'rent Parts, unnumber'd Piles The wretched Latins build: Some Corps in Earth (And many Those) of their dead Friends they hide; Some to the neighb'ring Coasts, and Towns they send. The rest, a huge promiscuous Heap of Slain, Unhonour'd, undistinguish'd, they consume: The blazing Fires illumine all the Fields. Now had the Third returning Morn dispel'd The dewy Shades of Night: The mingled Bones From the high Ashes, mourning, they collect; And load them with a Mount of smoking Mold. But most of all in King Latinus' Court, And in the Royal City, Sorrow reigns, And wildest Consternation: Aged Dames, And hapless Brides, and Sisters drown'd in Tears, And wretched Orphans, curse the wastful War, And Turnus' Nuptials. Let Himself, they cry'd, Himself decide the Quarrel with his Sword; Since to the highest Honours of the State, And to the Crown of Latium he aspires. This Drances aggravates with keenest Spight; Turnus alone, he urges, to the Field Is challeng'd; He alone must end the War. Much on the adverse Side, with various Speech, For Turnus is alledg'd: The Queen's great Name O'ershades him; and his Glory well-deserv'd By various Trophies, and his Fame in Arms. Amidst These Factions, and tumultuous Jars, Lo! from great Diomede's imperial Walls Th'Ambassadors, return'd with joyless Cheer, Their Answer brought; That by such vast Expence Of tedious Toil they Nothing could effect: Nought would their Presents, or their Gold avail; Nought their importunate Intreaties urg'd: The Latins other Succours must desire, Or to the Trojan Leader sue for Peace. The King Latinus' self with mighty Grief Sinks fainting: That by Fate's undoubted Doom Æneas came, the Anger of the Gods Declares, and recent Tombs before their Eyes. Therefore, within the lofty Court, he calls To Council all the Fathers of the State. They summon'd meet; and thro' the crouded Ways Flow to the Palace. In the Middle plac'd, The first in Years, and in imperial Rule, Latinus, with no joyous Aspect sits. Th'Ambassadors from Diomede return'd He first commands their Answer to report, And all unfold: The rest in Silence sate; And Venulus obedient Thus began. The Son of Tydeus, and the Grecian Camp, O Citizens, with Pain, we have beheld; Surmounted all the Hazards of the Way, And touch'd That Hand by which Troy's Kingdom fell. He Victor there Argyripa has rear'd, A City from his Native Country nam'd, And built on Iäpygian Gargan's Soil. Admission being gain'd, and Leave to speak; Our Gifts we offer; tell our Name, and Birth; What People had invaded us with War; What Cause had brought us to th'Ætolian Coast. This heard; with pleasing Grace he Thus reply'd. O Nations bless'd by Fate, Saturnian Realms, Ancient Ausonians; What disastrous Chance Disturbs your Peace, and prompts you to engage In Wars unknown? We all, who with the Sword Presum'd to violate the Trojan Fields, (I pass Those Toils which fighting we sustain'd Beneath the lofty Walls, the Heroes swept By Simois' Stream) o'er all the World have felt Unheard-of Woes, and Penance for our Crimes, Which Priam's self would pity. This well knows Incens'd Minerva's inauspicious Star; Vengeful Caphareus; and th'Eubœan Rocks. Since That fam'd War, to various distant Shores, Exil'd, and from each other toss'd, we rove; To Proteus' Pillars Menelaüs driv'n, Ulysses to the Ætnæan Cyclops' Caves. Of Pyrrhus' Tragic Kingdoms shall I tell? Or of Idomeneus' subverted State? Or of the Locrians on the Libyan Coast? Great Agamemnon's self, our King, the Chief Of Greeks, by his disloyal Consort's Hand, In the first Entrance of his Palace fell; Asia was conquer'd, and the Adult'rer crown'd. Shall I relate how unpropitious Gods Gave not to Me to view my Native Soil, Debar'd me from my much-lov'd Queen's Embrace, And beauteous Calydon? Ev'n now Portents, Hideous to Sight, pursue us; And my Friends, Lost in new Bodies, and transform'd to Birds, Or wing the Air, or wander in the Streams; (O dire Infliction! and my Country's Woe!) And with their plaintive Cries the Rocks resound. This might I well expect; since, mad in Arms, Ev'n the Celestial Bodies I assail'd, And with a Wound bright Venus' Wrist profan'd. But urge not, urge not Me to Fights like These: Nor with the Trojans wage I any War, After the Fall of Troy; nor with Delight Do I reflect on their Misfortunes past. The Presents, which to Me you hither brought, Bear to Æneas: I have stood oppos'd To his rough Darts; and hand to hand engag'd: Credit th'Experienc'd, with how vast a Swing He wheels his Sword, and rises to his Shield; With what a Whirlwind flies his missive Spear. Had Two such Heroes more on Ida's Coast Been bred; the Trojans with invasive War Would to Inachia's Cities have advanc'd, And Greece lamented the Reverse of Fate. Whate'er Obstruction to our Siege was giv'n Before the stubborn Walls of hardy Troy, Great Hector, and Æneas gave: By Them The Grecian Conquest long suspended hung, And to the Tenth revolving Year retir'd. Both fam'd for Courage, both renown'd in Arms; This first in Piety. Join you your Hands On any Terms, and ratify the Peace: But O beware; nor Arms to Arms oppose. Thus, Best of Kings, his Answer you have heard; And his Resolves on This important War. Scarce had the Legates spoke; A various Noise Thro' the confus'd Ausonian Council ran: As rapid Rivers, pent in rocky Caves, Hoarse Murmurs roll; The neighb'ring Banks resound. Soon as the struggling Passions were allay'd, And all their trembling Mouths in Silence clos'd; First, having to the Gods address'd his Pray'r, Thus from his lofty Throne the King began. I could have wish'd, Ye Latins, that before This present Time (and fitter had it been) We had determin'd on the Sum of Things. Less seasonable is it to debate In Council, when the Foe surrounds our Walls. Unequal War, Ye Citizens, we wage With Sons of Gods, a brave unconquer'd Race: Who by no Toils or Battles are fatigu'd; Nor, ev'n when vanquish'd, can abstain from Fight. What Hope of Succours from th'Ætolian Arms You had conceiv'd, dismiss: Each to Himself Is his own Hope; but how small That, you see, In what a Ruin of Affairs confus'd The Rest all lies, of force you must perceive; 'Tis all before your Eyes, and in your Hands. Nor Any do I blame: What Courage could, Has been perform'd; and all the Realm engag'd With it's whole Body, and it's utmost Pow'rs. Now (mark me well) what Purpose to my Thoughts Doubtful occurs, in brief I will unfold. A Tract of Land I have near Tyber's Stream, Stretch'd to the West beyond Sicania's Bounds; Th'Aurunci and the Rutuli with Shares Manure the stubborn Hills, and sow the Glebe, And turn to Pasture what rejects the Plough. Be all This Region, and the piny Sides Of the tall Mountain to the Trojans giv'n, Gage of our Friendship: Let our selves propose The equal Terms of Peace; and to our Realms Invite them as Allies: Here let them fix, (If such their strong Desire) and found their Walls. But if to other Nations, other Coasts They would repair, and can withdraw from Ours; With Latian Timber let us build them Ships, Twenty, or more; if more their Need requires. Along the River all Materials lie; The Size and Number let Themselves prescribe: Be Ours the Cost, the Work, and Naval Stores. What farther I propose, is to dispatch An hundred chos'n Ambassadors, the Chief Of Latian Peers, these Offers to convey, With Olive in their Hands, and firm the League: Presents of Gold, and Iv'ry let them bear, The Chair, and Robe, the Ensigns of our State. Do You with Prudence for the Publick Good Consult; and succour our distress'd Affairs. Then Drances, He whom Turnus' Glory stung With oblique Envy, and the Goads of Spight; Potent in Wealth, more potent with his Tongue; But of a cold, unactive Hand in War: In Policy no weak Adviser deem'd; Mighty in Factions: By his Mother's Side Of noble Birth, of doubtful by his Sire's: He rises, and with Virulence of Words Thus Turnus loads, and irritates their Rage. What You propose, great King, has nought obscure; Nor needs our Suffrage: All confess they know The true Expedient which the State requires; But fear to speak their Thoughts. Let Him permit Freedom of Speech, and moderate his Vaunts; By whose unlucky Conduct and whose Crimes (Nay I will speak, tho' Arms and present Death He menaces) we see so many Lights Of Latium quench'd, so many Leaders fall'n, And all the City weeping on the Ground: While hov'ring he surveys the Trojan Camp, Trusting in Flight, and braves the Sky with Arms. To all Those Presents, which You, Best of Kings, Send to the Trojans, be One added more: Unmov'd by any Violence, or Threats, Give to a worthy Son the Royal Bride; And by That lasting Pledge confirm the Peace. But if so great a Terrour awes our Minds; Himself we will implore, and from Himself Intreat This Favour: Let him to the King, And to his Country yield their proper Rights. O Thou, the Head, and Source of all This Woe To Latium; Why so oft dost thou expose Our wretched Citizens to Toils and Death? No Safety is in War: To Thee for Peace, Turnus, we sue, and for it's certain Pledge. Lo! I the first, whom Thou wilt have thy Foe, (Nor am I careful to renounce That Name) I suppliant come: Commiserate thy Friends; Abate thy Fire; and routed quit the Field: Enough of Blood and Slaughter have we seen, And desolated the wide Regions round. Or if by Thirst of Glory thou art warm'd; If so much Courage harbours in thy Breast, And so much Love of Empire for thy Dow'r: Advance in Fight, and obvious meet the Foe. Forsooth, that Turnus may espouse a Queen; We, viler Lives, a Rabble, uninterr'd, And undeplor'd, must perish in the War: Do Thou, if any Spirit in That Breast, If any of thy Country's Mars is lodg'd, Exert thy self; and look Him in the Face, Who dares thee to the Field. These Words the Violence of Turnus fir'd: Deeply he groan'd; and from his inmost Soul With Indignation Thus the Hero spoke. Great is your Volubility of Speech, Drances, 'tis own'd: Then always, when the War Demands our Arms, and when the Fathers meet, You first are present. But 'tis now no Time To fill the Court with Words, which fly from You With mighty Noise in Safety: when our Walls With Bulwarks keep the Enemy at Bay, Nor foam our Trenches with a Tide of Blood. Then thunder Thou, as usual, with thy Bolts Of Eloquence: And Me do Thou arraign Of Cowardise, Thou, Drances; when Thy Hand Such Heaps of slaughter'd Trojans shall have rais'd, And all with Martial Trophys deck'd the Fields. What your redoubted Valour can perform You now may try: Nor need we seek the Foes At distance; They besiege our Walls around. March we adverse? Why This Delay in Thee? Shall all Thy Mars in That loud blustring Tongue, And in the Swiftness of Those coward Feet Consist for ever? I routed? Who, degen'rate Wretch, on Me Will fix That Brand; who thinks on Tyber's Stream Frothing and swoln with Floods of Trojan Gore, And all Evander's Race upon the Ground Fall'n prostrate, and th'Arcadians stripp'd of Arms? Bitias, and Pandarus, of Giant-Bulk, Found Me not routed; nor Those Thousand more, Whom, Victor, in one Day I sent to Hell, Hem'd round with Foes, and pent within their Walls. No Safety is in War? Go, Fool, and preach Such Maxims to the Trojan, and Thy Friends: Cease not with panick Fear t'embroil our State, Extol the Strength of a twice vanquish'd Race, And lessen and depress Latinus' Arms. Just now, 'tis found, the Myrmidonian Lords, Tydides, and the Larissæan Chief Achilles, trembled at the Phrygian Arms: And, flying from the Adriatick Waves, Affrighted Aufidus rolls back his Stream. Now too the Miscreant my pretended Crimes Embitters, with his own dissembled Fear Of my Revenge: A Soul like That (dismiss Thy Terrour) by This Hand thou ne'er shalt lose; There let it dwell, and in That Breast remain. To You, great Monarch, and to your Debates I now return. If You no more repose Hope in our Arms; If by one Battle lost We perish Whole, and Fortune knows no Change; Let us beg Peace, and stretch our Hands unarm'd. (Yet Oh! did any of our pristine Worth And Vertue still remain; That Man to Me Would in his glorious Toils most bless'd appear, Who rather than behold a Thing like This, Fell once for all, and dying bit the Ground.) But if a Force entire to us is left Still in Reserve, and Latian Towns, and States Auxiliary; If Glory to our Foes Came purchas'd at a vast Expence of Blood; If They too have their Fun'rals; And thro' all The Tempest rag'd with equal Fury; Why Faint we inglorious in the first Attempt, And shrink with Fear before the Trumpet's Sound? Oft has Vicissitude of changeful Time By various Turns to better State restor'd Distress'd Affairs: Many with pleasing Sport Fortune, alternately revisiting, Has mock'd, and on a solid Base repos'd. Will not Ætolian Arpi give us Aid? Yet will Messapus, and Tolumnius lov'd By Fortune, and the Chiefs whom various States Have hither sent: Nor small will be the Fame Of Those in Latium and Laurentum rais'd. These of the Volscian Race Camilla joins, Leading her Horse-Brigade, and Troops with Brass Refulgent. But if Me alone for Fight The Trojans claim; If That be Here resolv'd; And I so much obstruct the common Good: Not so has Conquest with Aversion fled These Hands of Mine, that aught I would refuse To enterprize for so sublime a Hope. Undaunted will I march to meet the Foe; Tho' He a Second great Achilles prove, Arm'd, like the First, with Panoply Divine By Vulcan forg'd. To You, and to the King Latinus, Father of my Royal Bride, I Turnus, nought inferiour in my Fame To our great Ancestors, This Life devote: Me only dares Æneas? Dare he still: And let not Drances, whate'er Wrath of Heav'n Impends, or whate'er Glory may be won, Sustain the first, nor bear away the last. Thus They on doubtful Schemes debating strove; Æneas march'd his Army from the Camp. Lo! rushing thro' the Court with frantick Haste A Messenger with Terrour fills the Town; Relates, that in Array of Battle rang'd The Trojans and the Tyrrhene Troops descend From Tyber's Stream, and cover all the Plain. Forthwith their Minds with stimulating Rage Are stung, confus'd: To Arms, To Arms, they cry: The madding Multitude, and Warriour Youth Together rave: The pensive Fathers weep, And murmur unresolv'd: To Heav'n ascends A Clamour of Dissent, and various Noise. As when on some tall Wood the flocking Birds Alight: Or in the fishy Stream of Po Loquacious Swans with clatt'ring Pinions sound. Yes, now Ye Citizens, brave Turnus cry'd, (Snatching th'Occasion) is the Time to sit In Council, and harangue in Praise of Peace: By War They rush to Empire. More than This He spoke not, but with rapid Speed forsook The Court, and from the lofty Hall withdrew. Thou, Volusus, he cry'd, command to Arms The Volscian Troops; and to the Battle lead The Rutuli: Do Thou, Messapus, pour The Horse into the Field: And join'd with Thee Let Coras, with his Brother, range the Fight: Let Others guard the Passes of the Town, And man the Tow'rs: The rest where I command On Me shall wait, and with Me dare in Arms. Strait to the Works from all the City round They croud: Latinus' self the Council leaves; And, with the Tumult of the Times perplex'd, Adjourns th'important Business of the State: And much himself accuses, that long since He had not in the strict Alliance join'd Æneas, and as Son-in-law receiv'd. Others dig Trenches deep before the Gates, And roll vast Stones, and Palisadoes fix: The Trumpet with shrill Clangor to the Fight The bloody Signal sounds: The Dames, and Boys In a promiscuous Throng the Ramparts crown; The last of Labours calls them all to War. Mean-while the Queen to Pallas' stately Dome Amidst a num'rous Quire of Matrons, rode, And Off'rings bore; Lavinia by her Side, The Royal Virgin; Cause of all their Woe; Her beauteous Eyes cast down, and bent on Earth. The Matrons follow; and with Incense sweet Perfume the Temple; and with mournful Sound Thus from the stately Entrance breathe their Pray'r. Tritonian Virgin, Arbitress of War, Break with Thy Hand the Phrygian Pirate's Lance; And Him lay prone extended on the Ground, And roll his Trunk beneath the lofty Gates. Turnus himself arms, furious, for the Fight; In his Rutulian Corslet clad, and rough With brazen Scales, he sheaths his Legs in Gold, His Head yet bare; then buckles to his Side His faithful Sword; from the high Fort runs down, And shines all o'er in Gold; with Martial Pride Exulting, and in Hope prevents the Foe. So, loose with broken Reins, the sprightly Steed Flies from his Stall, and gains the open Field; Or to the Pastures, and the Female-Herd He bends his Course; or to the wonted Stream, To bathe his Limbs: He neighs, and bounds from Earth Luxuriant, prancing, with his Chest erect, And Head high toss'd in Air: His waving Mane Flows on his Neck, and o'er his Shoulder plays. Him obvious with her Volscian Squadron meets Camilla, Warriour Queen; and from her Steed, In the first Entrance of the Gate, alights: By her Example, all the Troop to Earth, Quitting their Horses, slide: Then thus she speaks. Turnus, if aught of Confidence the Brave With Justice may assume; I dare to meet, And promise to engage th'Æneian Lines, And single to oppose the Tyrrhene Horse. Let me first try the Perils of the War; Stand Thou in Arms on foot, and guard the Walls. Fixing his Eyes upon the wond'rous Maid, Turnus replies: O Thou, the Pride and Boast Of Latium, matchless Nymph; What Thanks to Thee Can I repay? Since now That Spirit soars Above all Dangers; share Thy Toils with Mine. Æneas, (so my Scouts and Fame report) Has sent his light-arm'd Horse to scour the Fields: Himself along the desart Mountain's Top Advancing hastes, and marches to the Town. Now in the hollow Passes of the Wood An Ambush I prepare, and to beset With an arm'd Force the narrow double Ways. Do Thou in Fight sustain the Tyrrhene Horse: Thee brave Messapus, and the Latin Troops, And Tyburs shall attend: Be Thou their Chief. He said; and rous'd Messapus to the Fight; And all the Leaders with like Ardour fir'd: Then marches opposite, and seeks the Foe. Deep in a winding Tract a Valley lies, Well form'd for Ambush, and the Frauds of War, On ev'ry side with gloomy Boughs inclos'd; To which a slender Path, thro' narrow Jaws, (A difficult, malignant Passage) leads: High on the Mountain's Top a secret Plain, And safe Retreat, there lies: Or to the right, Or to the left, from thence you may engage, Obvious in Fight; or standing on the Ridge Roll Stones and rocky Fragments on the Foe. Hither the Youthful Hero march'd his Force, Thro' the known Ways; with Expedition seiz'd The Post, and in th'uneven Thickets lay. Mean-while Diana in the Seats above Swift Opis calls, one of her sacred Train, And chosen Virgins; and with mournful Voice Thus speaks. To cruel War Camilla goes, O Nymph, and buckles on our Arms in vain; Dear above all to Me: Nor late, or new Is This Affection in Diana's Breast; Nor sprang it from a sudden sweet Surprize. When Metabus, ejected from his Realm, And from Privernum's ancient City, fled Prevailing Faction, and rebellious Rage; An Infant thro' the Foes, and Arms he bore, Companion of his Exile; and her Name Camilla call'd: Casmilla was his Queen's, Thus to his Daughter with small Change transferr'd. Her bearing in his Bosom, to the Cliffs And solitary Woods he took his Way: The hostile Darts encompass'd him around, And the arm'd Volscians hover'd o'er the Field. Lo! in the Middle of his Flight, the Stream Of Amasenus foam'd above it's Banks; So great a Show'r had burst the bellying Clouds. Love of his Child, as he prepares to swim, Retards him; for his darling Charge he fears: Turning on ev'ry Side his shifting Thoughts, This sudden Resolution he approves. A pond'rous Jav'lin in his warlike Hand, Solid with Knots and strong tough Oak, he bore: To This he binds the Child, in silvan Cork Inclos'd, with Osiers, and the Rind of Trees, And fitted to the Middle of the Spear; Which poising in his Hand, he Thus address'd His Suit to Heav'n. Auspicious Queen of Woods, Latonia, Virgin-Goddess, grant my Pray'r: To Thee the Father's self his Daughter vows Thy Servant; She, thy Weapon grasping first, Flies thro' the Air, thy Suppliant, from the Foe: Accept thy Own, great Goddess, I implore, Just now committed to th'uncertain Winds. This said; with Arm swung-back he hurl'd the Spear: The River sounds; and o'er it's rapid Stream Camilla with the whistling Jav'lin flies. But Metabus, more closely now pursu'd, Plunges into the Waves; and, having gain'd His wish'd Design, his Jav'lin, with the Child Sacred to Trivia, from the grassy Turf, Wrenching, releases. Him within their Gates, Or hospitable Walls, no Towns receiv'd: Nor would himself, so fierce his Soul, have yielded With Them t'associate. On the lonely Hills In Solitude a Shepherd's Life he chose: Here, in the Brakes, and savage Dens of Beasts, He nurs'd his Daughter from the Dugs of Mares, Milking their Teats into her tender Lips. Soon as the Infant first with doubtful Feet Could press the Ground; her little Hands he fill'd With pointed Darts, and on her Shoulder hung A Bow, and Quiver. No soft Caul of Gold Her Tresses strains; nor flows her waving Gown: Instead of These a Tyger's horrid Hide Hangs from her Head, and o'er her Back descends. Darts with her tender Hand ev'n Then she threw; And, whirling round her Head a sounding Sling, Struck a Strymonian Crane, or snow-white Swan. Her many Matrons o'er the Tyrrhene Towns Attempted with their Sons to match in vain: She, with Diana's Love alone content, (Love undecaying, and confirm'd by Time) Her Shafts, and her Virginity preserves, Inviolate. Well for her had it been, Had she been less in love with such a War; And much I wish she never had engag'd In This Attempt, to dare the Trojan Pow'rs. My Fav'rite Nymph, and in my Virgin Train She might have liv'd. But now, since urg'd she goes By Fates unequal; Slide Thou from the Pole, And visit Latium's Confines, where the Fight Ill-omen'd rages: These my Weapons take, And from the Quiver draw th'avenging Shaft; With This let whosoe'er shall with a Wound (Or Trojan, or Italian let Him prove) That sacred Body violate, to Me Pay the exacted Forfeit with his Blood. Then in a hollow Cloud her Corps, and Arms, (Poor hapless Maid!) unplunder'd by the Foe, I to her native Country will convey; And hide them in a Tomb. The Goddess spoke: The Nymph, involv'd in a black Whirlwind, flew Thro' the light Air, and sounded from the Sky. Mean-while the Trojan Squadron to the Town Approaches, and th'Etrurian Chiefs, and all The Army of the Horse, compos'd in Troops By certain Numbers rang'd: O'er all the Field The bounding Coursers struggle with the Bit, Now This, now That way turn'd, and neigh aloud: A Wood of Jav'lins rises; and the Plain Glows dreadful with the iron Gleam of Arms. Nor less Messapus, and the swift Brigade Of Latins, and the Nymph Camilla's Wing, And Coras, with his Brother, on the Field Stand opposite; with Hands drawn back protend Their threatning Spears, and shake their brandish'd Darts. The Noise of trampling Feet, and neighing Steeds Burns in the Air, and nearer rolls the Fight. Now within Jav'lin's Reach both Armys stood; Loud with a sudden Shout in Onset fierce They rush amain, and rouse their thund'ring Steeds: Thick as a Storm of Snow their Arrows pour, And darken all the Sky. Tyrrhenus first, And brave Aconteus join the horrid Clash Of Conflict; and advance with hostile Spears, And mighty Sound, exerting all their Force: With Breast to Breast oppos'd their Coursers meet, And almost rive each other in the Shock. Aconteus, from his Seat dismounted, falls Like Lightning, or a Stone's unwieldy Weight Shot from an Engine; At a distance thrown He falls, and breathes his Soul dispers'd in Air. Forthwith the Lines disorder'd croud: And turn'd In Flight the Latins cast their Shields behind; And spur their smoking Horses to the Town. The Trojans urge the Chace; Asylas Chief Leads on the Troops: They now approach'd the Gates; The Latins in their Turn, with deaf'ning Shout, Wheel round their Steeds, and bend their pliant Necks: The Trojans fly, and slack the waving Reins. As when the Ocean, with alternate Tide, Now rushes to the Beach, and o'er the Rocks Tosses the Waves, and to th'extremest Sand Dashes it's curling Foam: Now refluent rolls With rapid Ebb, sucks back the rattling Stones, Flies from the Shelves, and naked leaves the Shore. Twice to their Walls the Tuscans drove in Flight The Rutuli; Twice, cover'd with their Shields, Themselves look back, and see the Foes pursue. But when, engaging in the Third Assault, All Battle join'd, and Man to Man oppos'd: Then dying Groans are heard; And drown'd in Gore Arms, Bodys, gasping Steeds, and slaughter'd Men Promiscuous roll: A rigid Fight ensues. Orsilochus against the warriour Horse Of Remulus (Himself he durst not meet) Darted a Lance, and left beneath his Ear The sticking Point: Impatient of the Wound, The raging Steed uprears his Breast erect, And paws in Air: His Lord dismounted rolls To Earth. Catillus strikes Iölas dead, And great Herminius, great in Soul, and Arms, And Body; Yellow was his Hair, his Head And Shoulders naked: Him no Wounds affright; So full, and large a Mark he stands expos'd. Thro' his broad Shoulders flies the trembling Spear; And doubles him, contracted with the Pain. Black Gore flows all around: With mortal Rage They scatter Wounds, and meet the glorious Death. But in the Midst the Amazonian Maid, Camilla, with her Shafts, and Quiver storms, Exulting, fierce among the slaughter'd Heaps, With one Breast bare commodious for the Fight: Now hurls repeated Jav'lins, now with Toil, Unweary'd snatches her well-temper'd Axe: Her gilded Bow, and all Diana's Arms Sound from her Shoulder. Ev'n, when turn'd in Flight, (If e'er she turn) her Arrows she directs Shot backward, and behind her bends the Bow. Her choicest Virgins near her Person ride, Larina, Tulla, and Tarpeia brave Shaking her brazen Axe, Italian Nymphs; Whom for her self divine Camilla chose, Her Grace, and Ministry, in Peace, or War. As when the Thracian Amazons, engag'd In Conflict, beat Thermodon's sounding Banks, And shine in painted Arms: Or round their Chief Hippolyte: Or when the Martial Queen Penthesilea in her Car returns: And with a mighty Shout, and Tumult rais'd, The Female Troops exult with lunar Shields. Who first, Who last in Battle, Warlike Maid, Sinks by thy Dart? How many on the Ground Extendest Thou in Death? Eumenius first, The Son of Clytius; whose uncover'd Breast Adverse she with a Length of pointed Fir Transfixes: Vomiting a Sea of Blood He falls, and dying bites the gory Soil, Tumbles on Earth, and welters in his Wound. Then Liris next, and Pagasus she kills: The first, while rolling from his wounded Steed He gathers up the Reins; the last, to Him Off'ring his Aid, and stretching, as he sinks, His ling'ring Hand: Both prone together fall. To These in Death she joins Amastrus, Son Of Hippotas: And with her Lance pursues Tereus, Harpalycus, Demophoön, And Chromis; Them, incumbent on their Rear She presses close. As many Darts as flew Shot from the Virgin's Hand, so many Youths Of Phrygia fall. On his Apulian Steed The Hunter Ornitus at distance rides, In Arms unknown: His warlike Shoulders broad By a Bull's Hide are cover'd; o'er his Head With their white Teeth a Wolf's vast yawning Jaws Grin fierce; a rustick Halbert arms his Hands: Himself amidst the thickest Troops appears, And by the Head entire o'ertops them all. Him met in Fight (for easy was the Task, The Troop now disarray'd) she pierces thro', And o'er him Thus with bitter Accent speaks. Tuscan, Didst thou conceive thy self in Woods Hunting thy wonted Game? The Day is come, Which by a Woman's Arms refels your Boast: Yet to thy Ancestors' departed Shades This Solace, no small Glory, shalt thou bear; 'Tis to Camilla's Dart thou ow'st thy Death. Forthwith Orsilochus, and Butes, Both Trojans of mightiest Stature, she invades: But Butes with a Dart she strikes adverse, Betwixt his Casque, and Corslet; where his Neck Shines, as he rides; and where his Target hangs From his left Shoulder. With dissembled Flight In a wide Ring, interiour, wheeling round She mocks Orsilochus, and Him pursues, From whom she flies: Then rising to the Blows Redoubled, thro' his Arms and Bones she drives Her massy Axe, nor aught regards his Pray'rs; From the warm Wound his Brains besmear his Face. The Son of Aunus next, Ligurian Lord, Inhabitant of Apenninus' Mount, Met her in Arms, and at the sudden Sight Startled repress'd his Steps. He not the last Of That deceiving Race, while Fate allow'd His Wiles to prove successful, when he saw That by no Flight he could decline the War, Nor any way avert the raging Queen; By Art, and Fraud attempts her, and Thus speaks. What mighty Praise is Thine, if thou confide, A Female Warriour, in That bulky Horse? Dismiss thy Flight, and hand to hand engage On equal Ground with Me; Thou soon shalt know To which of Us vain Boasts will fatal prove. He said; She, gall'd, and with such Taunts incens'd, To her Attendant gives her Steed, and stands With her drawn Sword on foot in equal Arms, And fearless bears aloft her maiden Shield. The Youth, supposing he had gain'd by Fraud His wish'd Design, swift turns the waving Reins, With his arm'd Heel his fiery Courser gores, Rapid in Flight, and scours along the Field. In vain, Ligurian Boaster, hast thou try'd Thy Country's slipp'ry Arts, with proud Conceit Puff'd up in vain; nor shall This study'd Wile Thee to fallacious Aunus safe restore. So spake the Virgin; and with wingy Feet, Which kindled, as she flew, outstrips the Steed, Stands to his Head oppos'd, and grasps the Reins, And gluts her vengeful Rage with hostile Gore. Not with more Ease the sacred Bird of Mars, The Faulcon, from a lofty Cliff pursues A Dove sublime in Air, and gripes her seiz'd, And scoops her Entrails with his hooky Claws; Torn Plumes and Blood fall mingled from the Sky. But not with unobserving Eyes, from Heav'n, The Sire of Men and Gods these Things beholds, Enthron'd aloft: Etrurian Tarchon's Rage He irritates, and goads him to the Fight. Therefore amidst the Slaughter, where the Troops Yielding give way, fierce Tarchon spurs his Steed, With various Speech excites them, calls aloud On each by Name, and rallys them to War. O void of all Resentment, whom no Wrongs Can move, Ye ever stupid Tuscans; Whence This Panick? Whence such Cowardise of Soul? A Woman drives you straggling, and defeats These Squadrons: Wherefore hold you in your Hands Those Swords, and those unprofitable Darts? But not to Venus, and nocturnal Wars Are You such Recreants; nor so listless watch The Bacchanalian Revels, when Those Feasts The crooked Pipe of Bacchus has proclaim'd, (This is your Love, your Study, and Delight) 'Till the auspicious Augur's Voice declares The sacred Rites begun, and Victims slain Invite you, with their Fat, and pamper'd Flesh, Into the deep Recesses of the Grove. This said, into the Midst he spurs his Steed, Turbid with Rage, and bent, Himself, on Death; Full against Venulus he justling drives, With his Right hand, embracing, grasps his Foe, And tugs him from his Steed, and in his Lap Bears him away, impetuous o'er the Field. A Shout to Heav'n is rais'd; The Latin Troops All That way bend their Eyes: Swift o'er the Plain Flies fiery Tarchon, bearing off his Prey, The Warriour and his Arms. Then breaks the Point Short from his Spear; and all around explores The most unguarded Part, which best might take The mortal Wound: The other from his Throat, Struggling and twisting with defensive Force, Wards off the Blow, and Strength with Strength eludes. As when the tawny Eagle, tow'ring high, Sticks with her griping Talons in a Snake, And snatches him aloft: He wounded writhes His tortuous Volumes, and with stiffen'd Scales Stares horrid; hisses loud, and in the Air Erects his threat'ning Head: She not the less Plies him, reluctant, with her hooky Beak, And with her sounding Pinions beats the Sky. So Tarchon bears from the Tiburtian Troop His Prey, triumphant. Rais'd with That Success, And following th'Example of their Chief, The Lydians rush. Then Aruns, due to Fate, Round swift Camilla with his Jav'lin wheels, Insidious; and what Fortune would present Easiest, explores. Where-e'er the raging Maid Thro' the mid Squadron moves, still Aruns close Attends her, silent, and her Steps observes. Where-e'er Victorious she returns, and quits The vanquish'd Foe; he thither bends his Reins With Secresy and Speed: Now These, now Those Approaches tries; runs all the Circuit round; And shakes, malignant, his unerring Spear. Sacred to Cybele, and once her Priest, Chloreus, by chance, all bright in Phrygian Arms, At distance shone, and spurr'd his foaming Steed: The Steed rich Trappings cloath'd, compact with Scales Of Brass, and Gold, like Feathers wrought: Himself Gaudy in Purple, and Barbaric Dye, Shot Lycian Arrows from a Cretian Bow; The sounding Bow, which from his Shoulders hung, Glitter'd with Gold; And golden was the Helm That deck'd his priestly Head; His saffron Cloak, And Linen-Folds, which rattled, as He mov'd, With yellow Gold he in a Knot confin'd; With Needle-work embroider'd were his Robes, And Asian Cuisses, that his Thighs inclos'd. Him the Heroick Maid, o'er all the Field, Uncautious sought, on Him alone intent; That to the Temple's Roof she might affix The Trojan Arms; or, Huntress, ride adorn'd And proud with captive Gold: Thro' all the Troops Him eager she pursues; and thoughtless burns With female Love of Trophys, and gay Spoils. Aruns, This wish'd Occasion having gain'd, At length, his Jav'lin from his Covert throws, And suppliant Thus to Heav'n directs his Pray'r. Supreme of Gods, Apollo, who thy Hill Sacred Soracte, Guardian, dost defend; Whom We the first adore; for whom we feed The Fire in piny Piles; and thro' That Fire, Safe in our Piety, and fearless, walk, Thy Worshippers, and tread on burning Coals: Grant me, Almighty Father, by my Arms This Blot, this foul Dishonour to remove. Rich Spoils, or Trophys from the conquer'd Maid I seek not; Fame my other Deeds shall give: Let This dire Pest fall vanquish'd by my Wound; Inglorious to my Country I'll return. Apollo heard; and part of his Request He granted, part dispers'd in fleeting Air. That with a sudden Death he should surprize Camilla, was indulg'd: That He return'd Should see his Native Country, was deny'd; And born by Winds the scatter'd Accents flew. Therefore when, darted from his Hand, the Lance Sung thro' the Sky; the startled Host perceiv'd The Sound; and all the Volscians to the Queen Quick turn'd their Eyes: Herself nor aught regards The whizzing Air, nor heeds the coming Dart; 'Till deep infix'd beneath her naked Pap The Weapon stuck, and drank her virgin Blood. Around their Mistress her Attendants run Trembling, and catch her, falling, in their Arms: But, more than all affrighted, Aruns flies, With mingled Joy, and Fear; and now no more Durst in his Lance confide, or obvious meet The Virgin's Darts. So flies the guilty Wolf, Red with the Slaughter of a lofty Bull, Or Shepherd; To avoid pursuing Spears, He flies; and, conscious of th'audacious Fact, Close to his Belly, cow'ring, claps his Tail; Seeks the high Hills, and devious lurks in Woods. So Aruns from all Eyes himself withdraws In wild Confusion; and, content with Flight, Plunges amidst the Host. She dying tugs The sticking Jav'lin: But between the Bones, In the deep Wound, fix'd stands the pointed Steel: All pale she sinks; her cold Eyes sink in Death; And from her Cheeks the rosy Colour flies. Then Thus, expiring, Acca she bespeaks, Her best lov'd Friend, and Partner of her Cares: Thus far I could, my Sister Acca; Now My Life-Blood issues thro' the aking Wound; And all things swim in Mists before my Eyes. Haste, and to Turnus These last Mandates bear; Let him succeed to Battle, and repel The Trojans from the Town. And now Adieu. So saying, from her slacken'd Hand she drops The Reins; and not spontaneous flows to Earth; Cold by degrees she sobs her Life away; Reclines her hanging Neck, and heavy Head, Leaving her Arms: And to the Shades below With Indignation flies her groaning Soul. Forthwith a Clamour beats the golden Stars, Immense, increasing: By Camilla's Death The Fight recruited with fresh Fury burns. All rush together, all the Trojan Force, The Tyrrhene Leaders, and Evander's Wings. Opis mean-while, the Nymph of Trivia's Train, Sits on a Hill; and fearless views the Fight. When She, amidst the Tumult of the War, Beheld Camilla with a cruel Wound Pale and expiring; from her inmost Breast Deeply she groan'd, and Thus the Goddess spoke. Alas! poor Nymph, a Penance too severe! Too rigorous a Forfeit hast Thou paid, For Thus presuming to provoke in Arms The Trojan Pow'rs. Nor Thee avail'd it aught, Lonely in savage Thickets to have liv'd Diana's Servant, and our Quivers worn. Yet Thee thy Mistress in th'Extremes of Death Inglorious will not leave: Nor shall thy Fall Uncelebrated thro' the Nations prove, Or unreveng'd. For whosoe'er he be, Who with a Wound thy Body has profan'd; Death is the Penalty for That Offence. Beneath a lofty Hill, a Bust there stood Of high-rais'd Earth; for King Dercennus rear'd, Ancient Laurentian King; and cover'd o'er With gloomy Oak. Here first with rapid Flight The Goddess takes her Stand; and from the Tomb Aruns surveys. When Him she saw in Arms Glitt'ring, and vainly swelling with Success: Why That way? Hither turn thy Steps, she said; Come hither, doom'd to perish; and receive The due Reward Camilla's Death demands: Shalt Thou too die by great Diana's Darts? She said; and from her golden Quiver took A feather'd Shaft, and bent her vengeful Bow; Bent it, 'till both the crooked Horns were join'd, And met each other; her left Hand at once Touching the Point, her right, and the tough Nerve Strain'd to her Breast. Forthwith the sounding Air, And Hissing of the Weapon Aruns heard, And in his Body felt the sticking Steel. Him, tumbled in thick Smoke upon the Plain, Groaning his last, and sobbing out his Soul, His Friends, unmindful, leave in Dust unknown: Opis to high Olympus speeds her Flight. Their Queen thus slain, first flies Camilla's Wing Light-arm'd; The Rutuli confounded fly, And brave Atinas, and the scatter'd Chiefs, And broken Troops: To safer Posts they run, And spur their foaming Steeds to reach the Town. Nor now can any Force in Arms sustain The Trojans, pressing, and dispensing Death; Or stand oppos'd: But languid back they bear Their Bows unbent, and o'er their Shoulders slung; And the swift Horses shake the putrid Soil With sounding Hoofs. A turbid Cloud of Dust Rolls to the City: On the lofty Tow'rs The Matrons stand, and to th'ethereal Stars Raise female Cries; and frantick beat their Breasts. With Those who thro' the open Gates first croud Into the Town, a mingled Throng of Foes Together presses: Nor a cruel Death Do they escape; but ev'n within their Walls, Their Houses, and beneath their native Roofs, Transfix'd expire their Souls. Some shut the Gates; Nor durst permit their own imploring Friends To enter: Those with Arms the Passes guard, These rush against those Arms; Among them all, A Slaughter vast and terrible ensues. Others, before their weeping Parents' Eyes, Excluded, by the Rout, and Ruin urg'd, Down the steep Trenches leap: With loosen'd Reins Some forward spur their Steeds, and blindly tilt Against the Gates, the Bars, and solid Posts. The trembling Dames themselves, when they beheld Camilla, by their Country's Love inspir'd Hurl Weapons from the Ramparts; pointed Oak, Harden'd with Fire, and sharpen'd Stakes they use Instead of Steel: Precipitant they run, In This last Conflict foremost tempt their Fate, And first dare perish in the Town's Defence. Mean-while to Turnus, in the Woods, convey'd The dismal Tidings came, and fill'd his Soul With Tumult: Acca to the Youth relates That all the Volscian Squadrons were destroy'd, Camilla slain, th'insulting Foes march'd on, Bore all before them with successful War, And to the Walls the Consternation roll'd. He furious (so the Will of Jove severe Ordain'd) forsakes the guarded Hills, and Woods. Scarce from That Ambush had the Chief retir'd, And, out of view, descended on the Plain: When Prince Æneas enter'd with his Troops The open Thickets, the high Mountain's Ridge O'erpass'd, and issu'd from the gloomy Grove. So Both, with rapid Haste, and all their Pow'rs, Together march, and strive to reach the Walls: And now but little Space between them lies. Soon as Æneas saw the distant Fields Smoking with Dust, and all th'Ausonian Host; And Turnus knew Æneas dire in Arms; And heard the thund'ring Hoofs, and snorting Steeds; Forthwith they had engag'd, and Battle join'd: Had not the rosy Sun in Western Waves (The Day declining) plung'd his weary Car, And brought returning Night. They pitch their Tents Encamp'd, and lie intrench'd before the Town. The End of the Eleventh Book. BOOK the Twelfth. When Turnus saw the harrass'd Latins faint With unsuccessful War; his Promise claim'd; Himself mark'd out, and by all Eyes observ'd: Conscious of inborn Worth he burns with Rage Implacable, and rouses all his Fire. The lordly Lion Thus, on Libya's Plains, Gor'd by the Hunter's Spear within his Breast Infix'd, at length springs furious to the Fight, And shakes with dreadful Pride his shaggy Mane; Intrepid snaps the sticking Dart, and roars, And foams with bloody Mouth. No less incens'd Fierce Turnus storms, He then accosts the King, And Thus gives Vent to his disorder'd Thoughts. In Turnus there is no Delay; no Cause For which the Coward Trojans should retract The Challenge they have sent: I dare the Fight: Perform, great King, the Sacrifice requir'd, And ratify the League. Or This Right hand Shall send to Hell the Dardan Renegade, Asia's Deserter, (Let the Latins sit Spectators:) and my single Sword refel The Imputation of our common Crime; Or He possess us conquer'd, and to Him The Royal Bride Lavinia be resign'd. To whom Latinus Thus sedate replies. O gallant Youth; The more thy Valour boils Exuberant, the more it me concerns With Prudence to advise, and fearing weigh All Hazards. Thee thy Father Daunus' Realms, And many Cities vanquish'd by thy Arms, Attend, to own thy Sway; Latinus too Has Wealth, and Counsel, and his People's Love. Other unwedded Virgins, and in Birth Not unillustrious, Latium's Regions boast. Do Thou permit me, free from guileful Arts, To open Truths not pleasing to be told; And fix them in thy Mind. The Pow'rs Divine Allow'd me not to join my Daughter's Hands With any Latian Prince; and That Decree All Gods and Men unanimous declar'd. O'er-pow'r'd by Love of Thee, by kindred Blood O'er-pow'r'd, and by my mourning Consort's Tears, All sacred Ties I violated; broke The Faith I plighted to her destin'd Lord; And took up impious Arms. Since That, what Woes, What Wars have still pursu'd me, what thy self, As Chief, hast suffer'd, Turnus, well thou know'st: Two mighty Battles lost, we scarce defend The Hopes of Latium in This City pent; Still Tyber's Stream runs smoking with our Blood; And all the spacious Fields are white with Bones. Whither so often am I hurry'd back? What Frenzy This? If after Turnus' Death, I stand prepar'd t'admit These new Allies; Why rather end I not the dire Debate, While yet he lives? On Me what just Reproach Would by our Kindred of Rutulian Race, And ev'n by all th'Italian States be cast; Shouldst Thou (may Heav'n avert the Omen!) fall, Betray'd to Death by Me; while here thou seek'st Our long'd-for Nuptials, and my Daughter's Love. Think on the various Chance of doubtful War: Pity thy aged Father; whom from Thee His distant City Ardea now divides, Sad and disconsolate. By This Advice Nought of his Fire abating, Turnus raves; And by his Med'cine more distemper'd grows. Soon as his Faculty of Speech returns, He Thus persists. Whatever Care for Me You have conceiv'd, dismiss it, Best of Kings, For Me, at my Request; and let me stake My Life for Glory. We too, Father, lance No ling'ring Spear, no ineffectual Darts; And from our Wound the Blood is taught to flow. Him nought his Goddess Mother shall avail, To skreen him flying in a female Cloud; And hide her self in unsubstantial Shades. But, terrify'd with new Alarms of War, The weeping Queen, already doom'd to Death, Hung on the ardent Hero. By These Tears I beg thee, Turnus, grant This one Request; If aught of Rev'rence ever touch'd thy Soul For poor Amata. Thou the only Hope Art left, the Solace of my wretched Age; On Thee Latinus' Fame, and Realm, on Thee The Royal House with all it's Stress reclines. Forbear; nor urge the Trojans to the Field; Whatever Fortune waits Thee in the War, Me too, my Turnus, waits: This hated Light I soon shall leave; nor in my captive State My conqu'ring Son-in-law Æneas see. The fair Lavinia seconds with her Tears Her Mother's Suit; and bathes her glowing Cheeks: A burning Flush runs o'er her Face diffus'd, And fires it's Whiteness: As the Crimson Dye Stains Indian Ivory; Or with the Red Of mingled Roses snowy Lilies blush: Such blended Colours o'er her Visage flew. He, on the Virgin fix'd, and gazing, stands; Turbid with Love, he burns for Arms the more; And to Amata Thus in brief replies. Send me not, Mother, with ill-boding Tears, And Omens, to the rigid Toils of Mars: 'Tis not in Turnus to defer his Fate. Thou, Idmon, to the Phrygian Tyrant bear (No Joy to Him) This Message. Soon as Morn, Fresh in her rosie Car, shall paint the Sky; Let him not lead his Trojans to the Fight: Let Trojans and Rutulians from their Arms Desist; His Blood and Mine decide the War; And in That Field the Royal Bride be gain'd. This said, with rapid Haste into the Court He rushes, and demands his Steeds; exults To see them paw and bound before his Eyes: Them Orithyia to Pilumnus gave, (Illustrious Present!) Coursers which surpass'd The Snow in Whiteness, and in Speed the Winds. The busy Grooms stand round; and with their Palms Clap their broad Chests, and comb their waving Manes. Himself his Corslet laces to his Breast Squalid with Gold and Brass; then fits his Sword, His Helmet, and his double Crimson Plume; The Sword which Vulcan for old Daunus made, And ting'd it hissing in the Stygian Lake. Next his long Spear, Auruncan Actor's Spoil, Which, in the Middle of the spacious Court, Against a lofty Pillar leaning stood, He grasps; and shakes it quiv'ring in the Air. Then Thus aloud: O never yet invok'd By me in vain, Now, trusty Spear, the Time Is come: Thee mighty Actor once possess'd, Now Turnus wields. Give me to stretch on Earth This half-male Phrygian; with my forceful Hand To tear the Corslet from his Body rent; And in the Dust to soil his Tresses, curl'd With crisping Irons, and perfum'd with Oils. Thus wild he raves; and from his smoking Mouth Burst Sparks of Fire, and Flashes from his Eyes. So hideous roars the Bull with previous Rage, And practises the Fight; against an Oak Whetting his Horns, he pushes empty Air; And spurns the Sand, preluding to the War. Nor less Æneas, in Vulcanian Arms Refulgent, rouses all his Martial Rage, Rejoicing with a League to end the Strife. His anxious Friends, and sad Iülus' Fears He then consoles, recounting Fate's Decree: His Answer by th'Ambassadors return'd To King Latinus sends, accepts the Truce, And fixes the Conditions of the Peace. Scarce had Aurora with her new-born Light, Returning, sprinkled-o'er the Mountain's Tops; When, issuing from the Ocean, Phœbus' Steeds Thro' their wide Nostrils snort the solar Fire: The Trojans and Rutulians for the Fight A Cirque before the lofty Walls describe; And Altars in the Midst of graffy Turf Build to their common Gods: Some Water bring, And consecrated Fire; their Bodies veil'd With Linen, and their Heads with Vervain crown'd. Th'Ausonian Legions march; and iron Troops Pour from the crouded Gates. To Them oppos'd The Trojans, and the Tyrrhene Squadrons rush, In various Arms; and no less rang'd in Arms, Than if the rigid Labour of the War Had call'd them to the Field. The Chiefs themselves, Amidst the Thousands, thro' th'embattled Lines Ride round, all rich in Purple, and in Gold: Mnestheus from old Assaracus deriv'd; Asylas brave, Messapus, Neptune's Son, Tamer of Steeds. When now (the Signal giv'n) All to their Posts allotted were retir'd; They fix their Spears in Earth, and rest their Shields. The longing Matrons, and the feeble Sires, And unarm'd Vulgar, load the Houses-Tops, And Tow'rs; or crouding fill the lofty Gates. But Juno from the Mount, now Alban call'd, (No Name, no Mark, or Glory Then it bore,) Surveys the lifted Field, both Armies rang'd, Trojans, Laurentians, and Latinus' Walls. The Goddess then to Turnus' Sister speaks, Her self a Goddess, o'er the sounding Streams, And Lakes presiding; (Jove to Her had giv'n That Honour for her Virgin Honour lost:) Nymph, Pride of Rivers, best by me belov'd; Thou know'st how Thee I have preferr'd to all The Latins, who the Bed of Jove ingrate Have e'er ascended; and with glad Consent Permitted thy Advancement to the Skies. Accuse not me, Juturna; but thy own Affliction learn. While Fortune and the Fates Suffer'd th'Affairs of Latium to succeed; I still protected Turnus, and Thy Walls. Now the brave Youth I see engag'd in Fight, With Gods unequal: And his destin'd Hour And Death approach. This Combate, and This League My Eyes endure not: Thou, if aught thou dare More present for thy Brother's Aid, proceed; 'Tis just: Perhaps a better Chance betides The wretched Latins. Thus she scarce had spoke: Juturna answers with her Tears; and beats With oft repeated Blows her beauteous Breast. Juno replies: 'Tis now no Time for Tears; Haste; and, if any Means be offer'd, snatch Thy Brother from his Fate: Or Thou excite New Wars; and break th'intended League: 'Tis I Persuade the bold Attempt. This said, she leaves The Nymph perplex'd, and wounded in her Thoughts. Mean-while the Kings in long Procession move, High in his Chariot, by four Horses drawn, Latinus rides: Twelve golden Rays inclose His Temples round; illustrious Argument Of his high Lineage from the Sun deriv'd. In his white Car young Turnus next succeeds, Shaking two Jav'lins of broad-pointed Steel. Then, from the opposite embattled Line, Comes the great Father of the Roman Race, Æneas, with his Shield's broad starry Orb All bright, and blazing in celestial Arms: Ascanius by his Side, the other Hope Of mighty Rome. And in his snow-white Robe The Priest a Youngling of a bristled Sow Brings to the Altars, and a Lamb unshorn: They turn their Faces to the rising Sun; Offer salt Cakes; and from the Victims clip The foremost Hairs; and on the flaming Hearths From consecrated Bowls Libations pour. Then good Æneas, with his Sword unsheath'd, Thus prays. Thou Sun, be Witness to my Vows; And Thou Ausonian Land, for which I bore Such mighty Toils; Thou Heav'n's Almighty King; And Thou Saturnian Juno, Goddess, hear, Now more propitious; And Thou potent Mars, Whose Deity controuls, and turns all Wars: You, Fountains, and you, Rivers, I invoke; And whatsoe'er Divinity resides Or in high Heav'n above, or Seas below. If Chance shall to Ausonian Turnus give The Conquest; To the King Evander's Walls 'Tis just the vanquish'd Trojans should retire: Iülus from These Regions shall withdraw; Nor ever shall th'Æneadæ return With new Alarms, or vex These Realms with War. But if my Arms with Conquest shall be crown'd; (Which rather I suppose, and may the Gods Confirm That Hope;) I never shall compel Th'Italians to receive the Trojan Yoke: Nor to their Empire does my Soul aspire. In Leagues eternal, and in equal Laws, Unconquer'd, let both Nations still remain; Gods and Religion I will add; His Pow'r And Empire let Latinus still enjoy: New Walls the Trojan Colony shall build; And fair Lavinia give Those Walls a Name. So first Æneas spoke. Then Thus reply'd Latinus, with his Eyes erect to Heav'n, And his Right Hand extended to the Stars: By the same Pow'rs, by Earth, by Heav'n, and Sea, I swear, Æneas; by Latona's Twins, And two-fac'd Janus; by th'Infernal Gods, And griesly Pluto's Court: Hear Thou this Oath, Great Jove, whose Thunder ratifies our Leagues: Upon the Altars and the middle Fires I lay my Hand, and Thus attest the Gods. This League, This Peace among th'Italian States (Howe'er th'Event may prove) no Time shall break; Nor me shall any Force or Pow'r avert: Not, tho' the Earth it plunge into the Sea In Deluge mix'd, and Heav'n with Hell confound. As now This Sceptre (in his Hand he bore His Sceptre) never more shall sprout with Leaves; Since, ravish'd from it's Mother Tree, it lost It's Boughs lop'd from it by the sharpen'd Steel: A vegetable Plant at first; now shap'd, And by the Artist's Hand inclos'd with Brass, The Badge of State for Latin Kings to wield. Thus They alternate firm'd the League, amidst Th'assembled Nobles: Then by ancient Rite They stab the sacred Victims on the Flames; Rend their yet living Entrails from their Breasts; And loaded Chargers on the Altars pile. But to the Rutuli unequal seem'd That Combate; And their Breasts, long since confus'd, With various Motions fluctuate: Now the more, When nearer they behold the Chiefs ill-match'd. Turnus augments Those Fears, as slow he moves With silent Pace, and at the Altar bows, Suppliant with down-cast Eyes; his livid Cheeks; And Paleness o'er his youthful Body spred. Juturna, when Those Murmurs she perceiv'd Thick'ning, and multiply'd among the Croud, Their shifting Passions, and their drooping Cheer, Mingles among the thickest Troops, assumes Camertes' Shape, from noblest Lineage sprung, Fam'd for his Father's Valour, and his own; Then scatters various Rumours thro' the Field, And Thus, not uninstructed, speaks aloud. Blush you not, Ye Rutulians, to expose One Life for All? In Number, or in Strength Are we inferiour? See the Trojans here, Th'Arcadians, and Etruria's fatal Band Hostile to Turnus. Should each Second Man Of Us engage; he scarce would find a Foe. The Hero's self, 'tis true, shall to the Gods, Before whose Altars he devoted stands, Ascend; and live immortal in his Fame: We, who now sit Spectators on the Plain, Our Country lost, shall bend beneath the Yoke Of Victors proud, and foreign Lords obey. With Words like These the Warriour Youths she fir'd; And thro' the Troops the spreading Murmur ran. The Latins and Laurentians, who e'erwhile Hop'd for a long Repose from bloody Toils, And Safety to their State, now chang'd would rush Again to Battle; wish the League dissolv'd; And pity Turnus' hard unequal Fate. This more Juturna adds, and from high Heav'n An Omen gives; Than which more better fram'd Could puzzle and deceive th'Italian Host. For in the ruddy Sky Jove's tow'ring Bird A Flock of River-Fowl with sounding Wings Before him drove; Then, stooping to the Waves, With his sharp Pounces snatch'd and bore aloft A stately Swan: Th'Italians, in Suspense Arrect, stand gazing: And the Birds all join'd (Prodigious to behold!) with screaming Noise Form a thick Cloud, and turn their airy Flight, Obscure the Sky with Wings, and press their Foe: 'Till, by the Weight, and by their Force o'erpow'r'd, He from his hooky Talons drops the Prey Upon the Stream, and flies into the Winds. Then all th'Ausonians loud with shouting Cries Salute the Omen; And prepare to range Their Troops for Battle: And the Augur first Tolumnius speaks. This, Ye Rutulians, This Is what I oft desir'd; I see, and own The Gods: By me, by me conducted, draw Your Weapons; You, whom Thus like tim'rous Birds The impious Renegade affrights, and wastes Your Shores: He soon will fly, and hoise his Sails. Close You your thick'ning Squadrons; and by War Defend your Leader from unequal Fight. He said: and running forwards hurl'd a Dart Amidst the Throng of Foes: The well-aim'd Ashe Flies on direct, and hissing cuts the Air. A thund'ring Shout succeeds; Then all the Ranks Tumultuous take th'Alarm, and burn with Rage. The flying Spear, as then by chance there stood Nine Brothers, of distinguish'd Shape and Mien, (Whom One chaste Confort of the Tyrrhene Race All to Gylippus of Arcadia bore,) Reach'd one of These, a Youth of beauteous Form, And deck'd in shining Arms; and where the Belt Close to the Belly strains the middle Waist, And the round Buckle clasps it's Joints, transfix'd His Flank, and stretch'd him on the yellow Sand. But wild with Rage the sprightly Brothers burn; Some draw their Swords, Some snatch the missive Steel, And blind rush on: 'Gainst Them th'Ausonian Troops, Resisting, croud; To These again oppos'd A Tide of Trojans, by th'Arcadians join'd With painted Arms, and all Agylla's Youth; All with like Ardour fir'd to end the Strife By open War: They hurl the Altars down; An Iron Tempest, and a Storm of Darts Hovers aloft, and blackens all the Sky. The sacred Hearths and Goblets they o'erturn; Latinus' self, the League now broken, flies, And carries back his disappointed Gods. Some rein their Chariots, or with active Bound Leap on their Steeds, and with drawn Weapons run. Messapus, eager to confound the Peace, Tyrrhene Aulestes, King, and on his Shield Bearing a Kingly Impress, with his Steed Justles adverse: He terrify'd gives way, And o'er the Altars, to his Back oppos'd, Ill-fated, on his Head and Shoulders rolls. Messapus fiery with his Jav'lin flies; And Him, much praying, with a mighty Spear High from his Steed transfixes, and Thus speaks. Thou hast it there; This Victim to the Gods Is better giv'n: Th'Italians, crouding, strip His welt'ring Body. Ebusus springs on, And aims a Blow; Him Chorinæus meets, And dashes o'er his Face a flaming Brand Snatch'd from the Altar: His huge bushy Beard Blazes, and spreads a Stench. The other close Urges his startled Foe, and in his Hair Twists his Left Hand; and, pressing with his Knee His Stomach, nails him prostrate to the Ground; And plunges in his Side the rigid Steel. Next Podalirius, with his Sword unsheath'd, The Shepherd Alsus, rushing thro' the Darts In the first Rank, pursues, and o'er him stands Threatning aloft; He, drawing back his Hand, Full in the Middle with his Axe divides His Forehead, and his Chin; and smears his Arms With spatter'd Brains all o'er: A deadly Rest, And iron Slumber seals his heavy Eyes, And closes them in everlasting Night. Then good Æneas stretch'd his Hand unarm'd; And, with his Head uncover'd, to his Friends Thus call'd aloud. Whence This so sudden Change To Discord? Whither rush you? O restrain Your Rage: The Treaty is confirm'd, and all Conditions fix'd; 'Tis just that I alone Engage; Permit me; Cease your Fears; This Hand Shall fix the League, by whose religious Rites The Life of Turnus is a Debt to Me. Thus while he spoke; a feather'd Arrow flew With hissing Sound, and in the Hero stuck: 'Twas doubtful from what Hand the Weapon came; What God, or Chance to the Rutulians gave So great a Triumph: Smother'd was the Fame Of That illustrious Deed; and none allow'd To boast the Glory of Æneas' Wound. When Turnus saw Æneas from the Field Retiring, and the Trojan Chiefs confus'd; Fir'd with new Hope he suddenly demands His Arms, and Horses; vaults with haughty Bound Into his Car, and guides the flowing Reins: Many brave Warriours in his swift Career He gives to Death; rolls many on the Ground Half-dead; or drives his Chariot o'er their Troops; Or plies their Backs with Jav'lins in their Flight. As when enrag'd, near frozen Hebrus' Stream, Mars clashes on his Shield, and wakes the War, And to his foaming Coursers gives the Reins; They, in the open Field, outfly the Winds, Notus, and Zephyrus: Beneath their Feet The Thracian Confines groan; And round him throng Fury, and Stratagem, and pale Dismay, The dire Retinue of th'ensanguin'd God. So Turnus, thro' the Middle of the Fight, Exulting, lashes on his fiery Steeds Smoking with Sweat; and (dreadful to behold!) Tramples his prostrate Foes: The rapid Hooss Scatter the gory Dew all sprinkled round, And spurn thick Clots of mingled Sand and Blood. Now Sthenelus and Thamiris he kills, And Pholus; These two last in closer Fight, The first at distance: And at distance both Th'Imbrasidæ, Glaucus, and Lades nam'd; Whom Imbrasus himself in Lycia bred, And with like Arms adorn'd, expert in War, And with fleet Horses to outstrip the Winds. Eumedes, ancient Dolon's warlike Son, Advances next; expressing in his Name His Grandsire; in his Soul and Deeds, his Sire: Who, whilom, undertaking to explore The Grecian Camp, presum'd for his Reward The Chariot of Pelides to demand. To Him far other Prize Tydides gave For That presumptuous Thought, That bold Attempt; Nor now aspires he to Achilles' Steeds. Him Turnus seeing on the open Plain At distance, first along the empty Space Throws a light Spear; then stops his harness'd Steeds, And from his Chariot leaps upon the Ground, And o'er him fall'n and half-expiring stands; Then, treading on his Neck, his Sword he wrests From his Right Hand, and drives into his Throat The shining Blade; and Thus, insulting, speaks. Trojan, lie there; and measure with thy Bulk These Fields, and This Hesperia, which with War Thou didst attempt: Such Prizes are obtain'd By Those who Me durst irritate; 'Tis Thus They plant their Colonies, and found their Walls. To Him Asbutes with a Jav'lin hurl'd He joins in Death; and Chloreus, Sybaris, And Dares, and Thersilochus, and next Thymætes falling from his flound'ring Steed. As when Edonean Boreas with loud Gust Roars on th'Æean Deep; and to the Beach The Billows roll; where-e'er the Wind exerts It's Force, the Clouds fly racking thro' the Air: So where exulting Turnus cuts his Way, The Troops retire, and in Confusion run; Rapid he whirls along, and in his Car His Plume nods high, and trembles with the Wind. Him storming Thus with unresisted Rage Phegeus endur'd not; but himself oppos'd To the swift Car; and with his Hand detorts The Mouths and Bridles of the foaming Steeds. While dragg'd along he hangs upon the Pole, Between the Harness; the broad-pointed Lance Reaches his Side, uncover'd to the Blow, And thro' his double-tissu'd Coat of Mail Razes his Body with a slender Wound. Yet with his Shield oppos'd against the Foe He turns, and tries the Fortune of his Sword. The Wheel, and rapid Axis in it's Course Roll him precipitate along the Ground; Turnus pursues th'Advantage; with his Blade, Betwixt th'extremest Shield and Breast-plate, lops His Head, and leaves his Trunk upon the Sand. While Turnus spreads such Slaughter thro' the Field, Victorious; Mnestheus with Achates join'd, And young Ascanius, in his Tent support Æneas bleeding, and with halting Steps Alternate, leaning on his ashen Spear. He, raging, tugs the Arrow, breaks the Wood, And for Relief the speediest Way demands; Bids them lay open with a wider Gash, And lance the Wound, and with their Swords rescind The Point's deep Bed, and send him back to War. Now present to his Aid Iäpys came, Iäsius' Son, by Phœbus fondly lov'd: On him his choicest Fav'rite heretofore Apollo his own Arts, and Gifts bestow'd; His Augury, his Lute, and feather'd Shafts. He, to protract his aged Father's Life, Chose Skill in Med'cine, and the Pow'rs of Herbs; And exercis'd a mute inglorious Art. On his long Spear Æneas leaning stood, And gnashing with Impatience; round inclos'd By sad Iülus, and the crouding Youth; And by their Tears unmov'd. The Leach, succinct In the Pæonian Mode, his Garb retorts: Much med'c'nal Remedy in vain he tries, With anxious Haste; in vain the sticking Dart Sollicites, and with Pincers gripes the Steel. No Fortune seconds his Attempt; no Art Of Phœbus aught avails. And now still more And more the Horrour rises in the Field: The Mischief nearer threatens; Black with Dust They see the Sky: The Horse approach; and Darts Fall thick amidst the Camp: To Heav'n ascends A dismal Noise confus'd of Warriour Youth, Groaning in Death, and gasping on the Ground. Here Venus, beauteous Mother, struck with Grief At That Excess of Pain her Son endur'd, From Cretian Ida crops a healing Stalk Of Ditany, with full-grown, downy Leaves, And purple Flow'rs; to Wild-Goats not unknown, When in their Backs the feather'd Shafts are lodg'd. This Venus, muffled in a Cloud, conveys Into the shining Vase, and dusky Flood; Infusing secretly Ambrosia's Juice, And odorif'rous Panacea. With This Iäpys ignorant foments his Thigh: Forthwith the Pain from all his Body flies; All stanch'd within the Bottom of the Wound The Blood subsides: And now the loosen'd Dart, Without Compulsion, drops into his Hand; And to it's pristine Tone his Strength returns. Arms for the Hero; Quick; Why stand you Thus? Iäpys cries; and first against the Foe Inflames their Courage: To no human Aid This Cure is ow'd, nor to the Artist's Skill; Nor Thee, Æneas, does my Hand preserve: A more than mortal Power effects This Change, And Thee for more Heroic Deeds restores. Greedy of Fight he sheaths his Legs in Gold, And hates Delay, and shakes his quiv'ring Spear. Soon as the Shield sate fitted to his Side, And to his Body the rich Coat of Mail; He strains Ascanius with an arm'd Embrace, And, lightly kissing thro' his Helmet, speaks. True Toil and Vertue learn, dear Youth, from Me; Fortune from Others: Now my Hand in War Shall Thee defend, and with vast Honours crown. Be Thou industrious, when mature of Age, To fix These great Examples in thy Mind; And, Them revolving, copy out thy Sire Æneas, and thy Uncle Hector's Fame. Thus having said, with tow'ring Port he strides From the high Gate, and shakes his mighty Spear; Together crouding from th'abandon'd Camp Antheus, and Mnestheus rush, and all the Tide Of Troops condens'd: Thick Dust obscures the Sky; And the Ground trembling groans beneath their Feet. Them marching forward from a Hill adverse Bold Turnus and th'Ausonian Squadrons saw; And sudden Fear ran chilling thro' their Veins: Juturna, first of all the Latins, heard And knew the Sound, and in Confusion fled. He rapid whirls into the open Field His dusty Troops. As when a Storm to Land, By some Tempestuous Constellation rais'd, Thro' the mid Ocean rolls: With sad Presage The Peasants shudder at the distant Noise, Foreboding Corn laid flat, and Trees o'erturn'd, And universal Ruin spred around: The Winds before it fly, and to the Shore Waft the hoarse Murmur. So the Rhætian Chief Against th'embattled Foes his Squadron led. Wedg'd in one Body, and conglob'd they stand: Archetius falls by Mnestheus; Epulon By brave Achates; Gyas Ufens kills: The Augur's self Tolumnius falls, who first Against the Foes adverse his Jav'lin hurl'd. Shouts rise to Heav'n: and o'er the dusty Field The Rutuli now turn their Backs in Flight. Himself no other deigns to strike to Earth, Nor in Pursuit, nor in the closer Fight, Nor with the pointed Jav'lin lanc'd from far: Turnus alone, amidst the Cloud of Dust, He seeks for Combate, Him alone demands. Seiz'd with That Fear Juturna, warlike Maid, Strikes down, betwixt the Harness, from his Seat, Metiscus, who the Car of Turnus drove, And leaves him fall'n at distance from the Pole: Herself succeeds, and guides the flowing Reins; Chang'd to Metiscus' Shape, and Voice, and Arms. As when the sable Swallow flutters o'er The spacious Palace of some wealthy Lord, And all around the lofty Court surveys; Collecting slender Nutriment, to feed Her prattling Young: Now here, now there, she skims The empty Cloysters, and the liquid Ponds, With sounding Pinions. So Juturna rides Amidst the Squadrons in her rapid Car, And ev'ry thing surveys: Now here, now there, Still shifting, her exulting Brother shews; Nor any where permits him to engage; But devious flies, and shuns the crouded Field. Nor less Æneas, wheeling, traces round The winding Maze; and seeks the Chief, and calls His Name at distance thro' the scatter'd Troops. As oft as tow'rds his Foe he bends his Eyes, Attempting to outstrip the flying Steeds; So oft Juturna from his Sight averse Retorts the Chariot. Whither should she turn? In vain she fluctuates with a Tide of Cares; And various Passions struggle in her Breast. Here swift Messapus, as by chance he bore In his Left Hand two Spears prefix'd with Steel, Hurls one well aim'd, and levell'd for a Wound: Æneas stops, and sinks on bended Knee, Contracted in his Armour; yet the Spear Driv'n with impetuous Force his Helmet raz'd, And from it's Crest struck off the topmost Plumes. Then fir'd at last, and dreadful in Revenge, And now perceiving with industrious Fraud Himself deluded, and the Car and Steeds By Stratagem detorted, much to Jove And to the Altars of the League profan'd Appealing, in the Centre he invades Their thickest Troops; and with resistless Swing Dire undistinguish'd Slaughter round him spreads, And all the Reins diffuses to his Rage. What God shall now to Me in Verse relate So many Woes of War; so many Deaths Among the bravest Youths o'er all the Field By Turnus, and the Trojan Chief dispens'd, Alternate? Was it then Thy Will, O Jove, That Nations destin'd to eternal Peace In such a furious Conflict should engage? Æneas in Rutulian Sucro's Side With quick Dispatch deep drives the rigid Blade, (First by That Combate stopping in their Speed The rushing Trojans) and, where Death could find The speediest Passage, pierces thro' his Ribs. Turnus on foot engages Amycus Push'd from his Steed, and his ill-fated Brother Diores; With his long protended Spear Wounding the first, the second with his Sword: Then on his Chariot both their Heads suspends Dropping black Blood, and bears them thro' the Field. Æneas, Tanais and Talos kills, And brave Cethegus, three at one Assault, And sad Onytes, Echionian Name, His Mother's Peridia. Turnus stabs The Brothers sent from Lycia, and the Soil By Phœbus lov'd; and That Arcadian Youth Menœtes, Enemy to War in vain: His Art was Fishing, and his poor Abode Near Lerna's Lake; and Stranger to the Great His Father sow'd in Furrows not his own. As when from diff'rent Parts two rushing Fires Invade a Grove of crackling Laurel-Boughs; Or from the Mountains Tops with tumbling Flood And roaring Noise two foamy Rivers run Into the Sea, and sweeping force their Way: With such Rapidity the Trojan Chief And Turnus thro' the Battle rush: Now, now Rage boils within, and stubborn heaves their Breasts Indocile to be quell'd; Now all their Strength Exerted labours, bent on mutual Wounds. Æneas with a Rock's enormous Weight, Driv'n like a Whirlwind, strikes Murranus down Headlong to Earth; Murranus, boasting loud His Stem deriv'd from all the Latin Kings, And mighty Sires, and Grandsires ancient Names: The Wheels beneath the Axle, and the Reins, Whirl rapid o'er him; and his trampling Steeds Crush him to Mire, unmindful of their Lord. Turnus meets Hillus rushing on amain With mighty Rage; and hurls the pointed Steel Against his gilded Temples: Thro' them driv'n The Spear stands fix'd, and quivers in his Brain. Nor Thee from Turnus did thy Hand preserve, Creteus, the bravest of the Grecian Race; Nor did his Gods, when great Æneas came, Protect Cupencus; Obvious to the Dart He gave his Breast, nor him did aught avail The solid Texture of his brazen Shield. Thee too, Thee, Æölus, Laurentian Fields Saw fall'n, and wide extended on the Ground: Whom nor the Grecian Squadrons, nor the Bane Of Priam's Realms, Achilles, could subdue: Here was thy Term of Life; Thy lofty Seat Lyrnessus, underneath the hanging Rocks Of Ida; In Laurentian Fields, thy Grave. Against each other all the Squadrons rush, The Latins all, and all the Trojan Pow'rs, Mnestheus, and brave Serestus, and Messapus, Tamer of Steeds, Asylas fam'd in Arms, The Tuscan Phalanx, and th'Arcadian Wings: All with their utmost Force exerted strive; Nor Pause, nor Respite; with vast Conflict fierce They push, and sweat, and labour o'er the Field. Here lovely Venus to Æneas' Thoughts Suggested, that his Army to the Walls Should march, and on the City pour the Storm, And with a sudden Siege surprize the Foe. He, while amidst the various Troops dispers'd Turnus he seeks, and round him throws his Eyes, Beholds the City from so vast a War Exempt, and undisturb'd by hostile Rage. Forthwith the Image of a greater Fight Inflames his Breast; His chosen Chiefs he calls, Mnestheus, Sergestus, and Serestus brave, Then, standing in the Centre, takes a Hill, Round which the other Trojan Legions croud, Nor lay their Targets, and their Darts aside: Them from the rising Ground he Thus bespeaks. Let nothing of Delay my Words attend; Here Jove is on our Side: Let None proceed Less active for the sudden Enterprize: This Day the City's self, Latinus' Court, The Cause of all the War, (unless they yield, And vanquish'd own my Sway,) I will o'erturn, And level with the Ground their smoking Tow'rs. Shall I, belike, on Turnus' Pleasure wait, Expecting, when he shall vouchsafe to stand My Arms, and beaten dare again in Fight? This is the Head, Ye Citizens, the Sum Of all the impious War: Bring flaming Brands, And re-assert the broken League with Fire. He said. They all in emulation strive, And form a Wedge, and rushing croud the Walls. Ladders at once, and sudden Fire appears: Some to the Gates advance, and kill the first Who obvious stand; Some hurl the missive Steel In Storms of Shafts, and darken all the Sky. Æneas' self, amidst the foremost Rank, Beneath the lofty Walls extends his Hand, And blames Latinus with his Voice aloud: Attests the Gods, that he again was forc'd Unwilling to the War; The Latins twice Were made his Foes; This second League dissolv'd. Among the trembling Citizens within Wild Discord reigns: Some press to ope the Gates Wide to the Trojans; and the King himself Drag to the Walls: Some resolute in Arms Sustain the Combate, and defend the Town. As when the Swain a Colony of Bees Shut in some hollow Pumice has descry'd, And fill'd with bitter Smoke; Confus'd within, And trembling, thro' their waxen Tents they run, And with sharp Stridor whet each other's Rage: Thro' the dark Cells a smoth'ring Stench is roll'd, With inward humming Noise the Cavern sounds, And smould'ring Smoke ascends in open Air. Amidst the Toils the harrass'd Latins bore, This farther Fortune added to their Woes; And quite o'erwhelm'd the City with Distress. Soon as the Queen beheld the Foe advance Against the Town, the Walls beleaguer'd round, And to the Roofs the flaming Firebrands fly; To These no opposite Rutulian Bands, No Troops of Turnus; Him with sad Presage Unhappy she imagines slain in War: Frantick with sudden Grief herself she calls The Crime, the Head, the Cause of all the Woe; A thousand Things she utters in Despair, Distracted, wild; and rends her purple Robes; And from a lofty Beam suspended ties The fatal Knot of ignominious Death. Which Tidings when the wretched Latin Dames Receiv'd; the Royal Maid Lavinia first Her rosy Cheeks and beauteous Tresses tears: Then all the rest run madding round the Court; And with loud Shrieks the spacious Palace rings. Hence the dire Fame o'er all the City spreads; Their Spirits sink; Confounded at the Fates, His City's Ruin, and his Consort's Death, With Garments rent Latinus goes, and all With Dust deforms his hoary ruffled Hair: And much himself accuses, that long since He had not in the strict Alliance join'd Æneas, and as Son-in-law receiv'd. Mean-while some distant Stragglers o'er the Field Turnus pursues in Arms, more listless now, And less delighted with his fiery Steeds. To Him the Wind with doubtful Terrour wafts The mingled Noise; Hoarse Murmurs of Distress, And Clamours from the City pierce his Ears. Ah me! What Sounds confus'd, what Cries disturb The Town? Why rush These Clamours from the Walls? He said; and, with his Coursers' Reins repress'd, In dumb Amaze stood list'ning: When transform'd Into the Charioteer Metiscus' Shape, His Sister, managing the harness'd Steeds, Accosts him Thus; Here, Turnus, let us push The Foe, where our first Conquest shews the Way: Others are left sufficient to defend The Town; Æneas pushes on the War Against th'Italians: Let Us too assault The Trojan Troops, and equal Deaths dispense; In Number not inferiour, nor in Fame. Turnus to This: O Sister; Long I've known you, when by Fraud You first dissolv'd the League, and in These Wars Your self engag'd: And now in vain you strive To hide the Goddess. But who sent you down Dispatch'd from Heav'n, and will'd you to endure Such Labours? Was it that you might behold Your most unhappy Brother's cruel Death? For now what Measures can I take? What Hope Of new Success can any Fortune shew? Before These Eyes my self Murranus saw (Than whom to me no dearer Name survives) Calling on me for Help, I saw him fall Mighty, and with a mighty Wound subdu'd. There Ufens fell, unfortunate, nor liv'd To see our Shame: The Trojan Victors keep The full Possession of his Corps and Arms. Shall I endure (That only now remains) The City to be raz'd? Nor with my Sword Refel the Taunts of Drances? Shall I shew My Back? And shall This Earth see Turnus fly? Is Death so terrible? Ye Gods of Hell, Be kind; since Those of Heav'n abhor my Pray'r. To You a guiltless Ghost I will descend, Unsully'd with This Stain, nor ever prov'd Unworthy of my great Forefathers' Fame. He scarce had ended; when amidst the Foes, Spurring his foaming Courser, Sages flies, Shot with a feather'd Shaft athwart the Face; And rushing calls aloud on Turnus' Name. Turnus, on Thee our last of Hopes depends; Commiserate thy Country: Fierce in Arms Æneas thunders, threatning to destroy Th'Italian Tow'rs, and raze them to the Ground: Ev'n now hurl'd Firebrands to the Houses fly. On Thee the Latins bend their Eyes: The King Latinus' self divides his wav'ring Thoughts; Doubtful, on whom he should confer the Name Of Son-in-law, and to which Part incline. Besides, the Queen, who still for Thee preserv'd Friendship inviolate, has urg'd her Death By her own Hands, and frighted left the Light. Only Messapus, and Atinas brave, Before the Gates, sustain the Fight: The Troops Stand thickning round them; and an iron Crop Of Blades unsheath'd gleams dreadful in the Air: You wheel your Chariot o'er the empty Plain. Confounded with the Croud of various Thoughts, And stiff'ning with Amaze, the Hero stood, In Silence deep: Within his Bosom boils Disdainful Shame, and Grief to Madness wrought, And Love inflam'd with Rage, and conscious Worth. Soon as the Clouds were from his Mind dispel'd, And Light restor'd; he turns his flashing Eyes To the high Walls, and turbulent of Soul The spacious City from his Car surveys. When lo! a flaming Torrent thro' the Planks To Heav'n redounding roll'd, and seiz'd the Tow'r: The Tow'r, which he himself with jointed Beams Had rear'd aloft, on Wheels, with Bridges rais'd. Now, now, my Sister, Fate prevails: Forbear To stop me; Let us follow, where the Gods And our hard Fortune call: I stand resolv'd To combate with Æneas; stand resolv'd To suffer all that's terrible in Death: Nor shalt thou longer see thy Brother live With Infamy: Permit me, I implore, T'indulge This Frenzy, e'er I leave the World. He said; and bounding from his Chariot leap'd Upon the Plain; then rushing thro' the Foes And Darts, his mourning Sister leaves alone, And breaks with rapid Haste the middle Ranks. As when a Rock from some high Mountain's Top Tumbles precipitate, or torn by Winds, Or by a roaring Flood, or eating Age; Down the steep Cliff the massy Fragment runs With Impulse vast, and jumps upon the Ground, Involving, as it rolls, Men, Beasts, and Woods. So Turnus rushes thro' the broken Troops To the high Walls; where most with Blood effus'd The Soil smokes drench'd, and Jav'lins hiss in Air; Then distant waves his Hand, and calls aloud. Forbear, Ye Rutuli, and You repress Your Darts, Ye Latins: Whate'er Chance of War Remains, is mine: 'Tis just that I alone Sustain the League, and end This Strife in Arms. They all retire, and clear the spacious Field. But Prince Æneas, hearing Turnus' Name, Forsakes the Walls, forsakes the lofty Tow'rs; Breaks all Delay, all other Toil; with Joy Exults: and thunders terrible in Arms. As great as Athos, or as Eryx great, Or Father Apennine, when crown'd with Oaks He waves the ruffled Forrest on his Brow, And proudly rears his snowy Top to Heav'n. Now eagerly intent all turn'd their Eyes, The Trojans, and Rutulian Bands, and all Th'Italians; Those who crown'd the Walls above, And Those who batter'd them with Rams below; And lay their Armour by: Latinus' self With Wonder views two mighty Leaders, born On distant Climates of the World, engage In equal Combate, and decide the War. They, when a spacious List was form'd, at once With rapid Onset darting missive Spears, Begin the Fight with Shields and sounding Brass. The Earth beneath them groans: Then various Strokes In closer Conflict, furious, they repeat; Fortune and Courage blended meet in One. As when, in shady Sila's spacious Grove, Or on Taburnus' Top, with hostile Force, And pushing Horns, two Bulls in Battle join; The trembling Keepers, and the Herd aloof Stand mute with Fear; the Heifers faintly lowe, Doubtful to Which the Empire of the Wood Must fall, which Lord the Pastures must obey. They with prodigious Strength alternate Wounds Inflict; with clatt'ring Horns each other gore; And with large Blood their Necks and Dewlaps lave: The Wood all round rebellows to the Noise. So Prince Æneas and the Daunian Chief Engage in Arms: Loud Clashing fills the Sky. Great Jove himself the equal Balance holds, And poises in it's Scales the Fates of Both: One with Success is charg'd; and one descends Loaded with Death. Here Turnus, thinking now His Blow secure, with all his Body's Force Springs forward, waves his Sword uprais'd in Air, And strikes his Foe. The Trojans loud exclaim; The Latins tremble: And the Bands of Both Stand fix'd, expecting. But the faithless Blade Breaks short; and in the Middle of the Stroke Deserts him; Nothing now but Flight remains For Aid: More swift than Eastern Winds he flies, Soon as he sees the unaccustom'd Hilt, And his Right hand disarm'd. The Fame reports, That swift ascending his new-harness'd Car, In the first Hurry of the Fight, with Haste He snatch'd his Charioteer Metiscus' Sword; (Leaving his own behind:) And That suffic'd, While the faint Trojans turn'd their Backs in Flight. But when to Vulcan's heav'nly Arms it came, The mortal Blade, like Ice, in shivers flew; The Fragments glitt'ring on the yellow Sand. Therefore with Fear confounded Turnus flies, And traverses the Field; now here, now there Doubles in doubtful Mazes: For all round The Trojan Lines embattled hem'd him in, Here a vast Lake, and there the lofty Walls. Nor less, tho' still disabled by his Wound, His Knees oft stagger, and refuse to run, Æneas presses on his trembling Foe With eager Haste, and Step by Step pursues. So the stanch Hound, loud op'ning in the Chace, Urges the Stag, or with a River's Stream, Or with the Hedge of crimson Plumes inclos'd; Scar'd by the Toils, and by the steepy Bank, A thousand Ways on various Ground he flies: But the fleet Umbrian with expanded Jaws Sticks close; now gripes, or seems to gripe his Prey, And disappointed bites the empty Air. Now Clamours rise; the Banks and Lakes around Reply; And Heav'n all thunders to the Noise. He flying chides his ling'ring Friends; and calls On each by Name, to bring his faithful Sword. Æneas opposite denounces Death And present Ruin, aggravates their Fright; Threatens to raze the City to the Ground, If any durst approach; and halting storms. Five Orbs involv'd, five Windings they complete, This way, and That: For now no trivial Prize Is sought: For Turnus' Life, or Blood they strive. An old wild Olive there by chance had stood With bitter Leaves; to Faunus sacred held By Mariners: On which, escap'd from Storms, (Such was the Custom) to the Latian God Their offer'd Gifts and votive Vests they hung. This holy Tree, to clear the Field for Fight, The Trojans, undistinguishing, had hewn. Hither Æneas' Jav'lin flew; here fix'd It stood; and in the stubborn Root remain'd. He kneeling tugs, and strives to disengage The Steel; and with his missive Spear to reach Whom in the swift Pursuit he could not seize. Then Turnus, wild with Consternation, prays: Great Faunus, aid thy Votary; And Thou, Propitious Earth, detain the sticking Dart; If I have still inviolate preserv'd Your ancient Honours; which with impious War The sacrilegious Trojans have profan'd. He said; nor were his Pray'rs in vain preferr'd: For, lab'ring at the tough tenacious Root, And wrenching long, Æneas by no Strength Could free the Iron from the binding Wood. There while he tugs and sweats; again transform'd Into the Charioteer Metiscus' Shape The Daunian Goddess to her Brother runs Assisting, and his trusty Sword restores. Which Pow'r and high Presumption of the Nymph Venus with Indignation seeing, flew, And from the solid Root releas'd the Steel. They Both, sublime in Courage, and with Arms Refitted, One confiding in his Sword, The Other rising to his brandish'd Spear, Stand opposite; and panting urge the Fight. Mean-while the King Omnipotent of Heav'n Thus speaks to Juno, from a golden Cloud Viewing the War: What now remains? What End, Celestial Consort, must at length be fix'd? That brave Æneas, Mortal-born, to Heav'n Is due from Fate, and destin'd to the Stars, Is known to You, and by your self confess'd. What then attempt you farther? And what Hope Detains you longer hov'ring in the Clouds? Beseem'd it that a Mortal with a Wound Should violate a God? Or that the Sword Should be restor'd to Turnus? And new Strength The Vanquish'd from your Pow'r receive? For what Without your Pow'r could weak Juturna do? Desist at length, by my Intreaty sway'd: Nor let your Soul in Silence be consum'd With eating Grief; But oft with sweet Regard Impart the Tenour of your Cares to Me. The great Event is at it's Point arriv'd: To You 'twas giv'n o'er Land and Sea to toss The Trojans, raise new Wars, deform the Court, And stain the Hymenéal Rites with Blood: Farther my Will permits not. Thus he spoke; And Juno Thus with downcast Look reply'd. That such indeed, Great Jove, was your Decree, Full well I knew; And therefore with Regret Left Earth, and Turnus: Else you should not here Behold me linger in This airy Seat Alone, and all Indignities endure: But, wrapt in Flames among the thickest Troops, The Trojans I would drag to Wars and Death. Juturna, 'tis confess'd, I did persuade To aid her wretched Brother; and approv'd That for his Life ev'n more she should presume To enterprize; but not to hurl a Dart, Or bend a Bow: By Styx' dread Source I swear, The only Oath which binds the mighty Gods. But now I yield, and loathing leave the Fight. One thing, which no Decree of Fate forbids, For Latium, for the Majesty and Rights Of your own People, suppliant I implore: When, join'd with Peace by happy Nuptials made, In lasting Leagues and Laws they shall unite; Let not the Native Latins change their Name, Nor Garb, nor Language; nor be Trojans call'd: Let it be Latium; Be they Alban Kings Thro' Ages; Let it be the Roman Race Fear'd for Italian Courage: Troy is fall'n; Let Troy be fall'n, and perish with it's Name. Smiling on Her the Sire of Men, and Gods: Sister of Jove, great Saturn's other Heir; Still boil such Tides of Passion in your Breast? But cease at length This unavailing Rage; To your Demands I readily accord. Th'Ausonians shall retain their Country's Speech, Their Name, and Customs: Only mix'd with Them The Trojans shall incorporate: To These Religious Ceremonies I will give, And make them Latins in one Language join'd. This blended Lineage, from th'Ausonian Blood Deriv'd, in Piety you shall behold Excelling Men, and Gods: Nor any Race Shall equal Honour to Your Altars pay. Juno assents, and pleas'd retorts her Mind; Then leaves the Sky, and from the Cloud retires. But other Counsels Jove revolves alone; T'avert Juturna from her Brother's Arms. Two Pests there are, the Diræ call'd: Whom Night At the same Birth with black Megæra bore, Tartarean Fury; with such twisting Spires Of Serpents bound, and added noisy Wings. These at the Throne of Jove, and in the Court Of Heav'n's dread Monarch wait, to strike with Fear Unhappy Mortals: when the King of Gods Sits meditating vengeful Death, or Plagues; Or terrifies the guilty World with War. Of These great Jove dispatches One from Heav'n, A baleful Omen to Juturna sent: She in a rapid Whirlwind downward flies; As when a Dart, which by the Parthian ting'd (The Parthian, or Cydonian) with the Juice Of black immedicable Poyson, springs, Shot from the twanging Nerve, along the Sky, And, undiscover'd, cuts the fleeting Shades. So Night's infernal Offspring flew to Earth. Soon as the Trojan Troops, and Turnus' Bands She sees; she changes, lessen'd, to the Shape Of a small Bird, which sitting on the Tops Of Tombs, and old deserted Tow'rs, by Night, Shrieks thro' the Shades, ill-omen'd: Thus transform'd The Fiend o'er Turnus' Visage, screaming, flies This way, and That; and flaps upon his Shield With flutt'ring Pinions. Him unusual Fear Stiff'ning benumbs: Uprose his Hair arrect, And to his Mouth his Speech with Horrour cleav'd. Juturna, when the Fury's clatt'ring Wings She knew, unhappy Sister! beats her Breast, And tears her Face, and rends her flowing Hair; What Succour, Turnus, can thy Sister now Afford thee? What to wretched Me remains? Or by what Art can I protract thy Life? To such a Pest can I my self oppose? Now, now I leave the Field: Ye Birds obscene, Fright not my trembling Soul; Too well I know Your beating Wings, and Death-denouncing Screams; Nor do the proud Commands of mighty Jove Deceive me. Is it Thus that he repays My Virgin Honour lost? Wherefore to Me Gave he to be immortal? Why is Death, Great Nature's Law, deny'd me? Mortal sure I now might end such Woes, and to the Ghosts Companion with my hapless Brother go. Nought without Thee, my Brother, now is left Delightful: O would pitying Earth to Me, Yawning, disclose a Grave; and thro' it's Womb Transmit a Goddess to the Shades below. She spoke, deep groaning; with her azure Veil Muffled her Head, and plung'd into her Stream. Æneas, shaking his long ashen Spear, Urges adverse; and Thus relentless speaks. What, Turnus, now is the Delay? Or what Dost thou revolve? No Hope of Flight remains: Arms must decide the Strife; To ev'ry Shape Transform thy self; Collect thy utmost Force, Whate'er thou canst in Art, or Courage; Wish For Wings to bear thee to the Stars aloft; Or hide thy self in op'ning Earth below. The Hero shook his Head, and Thus reply'd: Not Thy proud Threats, insulting Man, affright My Soul; Me Heav'n affrights, and Jove my Foe. No more he spoke: But looking round espy'd A pond'rous Stone, which then by chance there lay, An antique, pond'rous Stone, a Landmark plac'd, To part the Limits of th'adjoining Fields. This scarce Twelve chosen Men, (such Men as now The Earth brings forth) could on their Shoulders bear: With trembling Hands he rising lifts it high, Runs stagg'ring forward, and against his Foe Tosses th'enormous Load; but neither knows Himself, when running, nor when stagg'ring on; Nor poising in his Hands th'unwieldy Weight: His Knees fail tott'ring, and his Blood congeals. The Stone then rolling thro' the empty Space Drops short, nor reaches to the destin'd Mark. As oft in Dreams, when languid Sleep by Night Has clos'd our Eyes, we seem with eager Heat And Effort vain, to labour in the Race; And in the Middle of th'Attempt sink down, Weary, and faint; Nor does the Tongue perform; Nor in our Bodies does th'accustom'd Strength Second our Toil; nor Voice, nor Words ensue. So Turnus fares; Whate'er his Valour tries, The Fury thwarts him, and denies Success. Then various Passions struggle in his Breast; The City and the Latian Host he views, Wavers with Fear, and dreads the coming Dart; Perceives no Way for Flight, no Strength to move Against the Foe; and now no longer sees His Chariot, or his Sister Charioteer. Thus while he wav'ring stands, Æneas shakes The mortal Dart; and, having with his Eyes Mark'd out the destin'd Wound, with all his Force Collected, hurls the missive Death from far. Stones shot from mural Engines with less Sound Roar thro' the Air; Nor breaks so loud a Crash From bursting Thunder: Like a Whirlwind flies The Fate-conveying Spear, and opens wide The Corslet's Border, and the sev'n-fold Shield's Extremest Orbs; and whizzing passes sheer Thro' his mid Thigh. Down lofty Turnus falls, Wounded, on doubled Knee, and bent to Earth. A gen'ral Groan runs thro' th'Ausonian Host; The Mountain round rebellows; and the Woods Echoing return the Noise. He suppliant bends His Eyes: And, stretching out his Hand, 'Tis true, I have deserv'd, He cry'd; Nor will I strive To deprecate: Enjoy thy Fortune's Gift. Yet Oh! if aught a wretched Parent's Care Can touch thy Soul (Thou too hadst such a Sire The old Anchises) Pity Daunus' Age: And, whether living, or despoil'd of Breath, (Thine be That Choice) restore me to my Friends. Thou hast o'ercome: Th'Ausonians see me fall, And stretch my Hands: Lavinia is Thy Bride: Extend thy Hate no further. Fierce in Arms Æneas stood; and check'd his lifted Hand, Rolling his Eyes around: And now his Soul Still more and more relented, as he paus'd; When on the vanquish'd Champion's Shoulder high With well-known Bosses shone the fatal Belt Of youthful Pallas; whom with mortal Wound Turnus, unhappy Victor, struck to Earth, And on his Shoulder wore the hostile Spoils. Those Spoils the Trojan Hero having view'd, The fresh Incentives of his Grief and Rage; Inflam'd with Vengeance, terrible in Ire, Shalt Thou, thus deck'd with Trophies of my Friends, Escape from Me? 'Tis Pallas, Pallas gives This Wound; and from Thy execrable Blood Demands This Sacrifice of just Revenge. Thus while he spoke, beneath his Breast adverse Furious he plung'd the Sword: The vital Heat Leaves his slack Limbs; And to the Shades below With Indignation flies his groaning Soul.
