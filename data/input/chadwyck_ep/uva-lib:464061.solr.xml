Then many an erle &amp; barron hynde, That were of the barrons kinde, To Vortiger they ran anon, As his most deadlye fone; Hard on him can they fight, For to slay him they thought right. Vortiger with might &amp; maine, He with his host went them againe; A strong battell there was dight &amp; many a head ther of smitt, Soe that Vortiger that day Was glad for to scape away. Anon the barrons send their sonde Wyde ouer all England To all their freinds, sibb &amp; couthe, East, west, north &amp; southe, &amp; told them that sooth tyde, How Vortiger with great despighte, With great treason &amp; with wrong Their kinred had drawen &amp; honge. Wrath then was many a man, &amp; al together swarren then, That they wold not assunder breake, Till they were on him wreake. Euerye man on other besought, A great host on him they brought &amp; foughten with sir Vortiger 9 monthes of this yeere, That many a lady fayre &amp; free Lost her lord &amp; her meanye. Then the warr endured long, &amp; the barrons waxed strong, That Vortiger had not power, Against them longer to endure. Messengers anon hee tooke And made them sworne vpon a booke, That they shold his arrand gone, &amp; letters he tooke to them anon &amp; sent them ouer the seas iwis To Denmarke vnto king Anguis, &amp; that hee shold come att neede With all the power, that he might lead, Against his foemen for to fight, That wold depriue him of his right. Then was king Anguis blythe &amp; messengers hee sent swithe To duke, erle, barron &amp; knight &amp; to all, that weapon beare might. Then to shipp they went blithe And ouer the sea can they driue. &amp; when they came to Vortiger, He welcomed them with merry cheere &amp; seazed there into his hands Halfe the realme of England, That he had or haue might, For to helpe him in his right. When this couenant was made fast, All they dighten them in hast, Into battelle for to wend With the barrons, that were hende. Besids Salsbury a lyte, There the battell can they smite. Many a bold champion, &amp; many a 1000 in that stonde Were slaine &amp; brought to ground. Many a ladye &amp; damsell Can weepe that day with teares fell. Then had Vortiger 10 Against one of the barrons men; Discomffitted they were that day, With great sorrow they fled away; &amp; Vortiger, that wold not spare, But hunted them, as hound doth hare, Them, that he did ouertake, Noe other peace did he make, But did them all todraw &amp; hange, But sithen all that was wrong; Many a barron hynde &amp; free Fled out of his owne countrye &amp; dwelled out many a yeere, For loue of sir Vortiger. Then Vortiger ceazed into his hands The lands &amp; rents of all the barrons, &amp; both wiffe, chyld &amp; swaine He droue out of the lannd, certaine. King Anguis had, verament, A daughter, that was faire &amp; gent, That was heathen Sarazen; &amp; Vortiger for loue fine Vndertooke her for his wiffe &amp; liued in cursing all his liffe, For he did make the christen men To marry the heathen women, Soe that nighe all England Was fallen into the devills hand.

The messengers forth went, To seeke Merlyn, with good entent, &amp; fare &amp; wyde they him sought, But of him they heard right nought. Soe on a day the messengers, As they were sett att their dinners In a taverne in the west countrye, With meate &amp; drinke great plentye, An old churle, hee came in With a white beard vpon his chine, &amp; a staffe in his hand he had &amp; shoone on feete full well made, And begunn to craue more, &amp; said, he was anhungred sore, &amp; praid them on the bench aboue, To giue him something for gods loue. &amp; they then sayd, with out leasinge, That he shold haue of them nothinge, &amp; sayd: âIf that the churle be old, He is a stronge man &amp; a bolde &amp; might goe worke for his meate, If he itt wold with truth gett!â &amp; called to him euereche one &amp; bade him trusse &amp; away gone, &amp; sware by the ruth, that god them gaue He shold drinke with his owne staffe.

The messengers wondred all, Where the churle was befall, &amp; all about they him sought, But of him they heard nought; For in story it is told, The churle, that was soe stout &amp; bold, That spake soe to the messengers, As they sate att their dinners, Forsooth, itt was Merline the younge, That made to them this scorninge. The messenger went soone anon &amp; told Vther &amp; Pendragon, &amp; how the churle to them had tolde &amp; sware to them with words bold, &amp; told them, how Merlyne the chylde Was byding in the forrest wylde &amp; bade them take barrons 5, To come and speake with him belyue, &amp; sayd, Merlyn wold them abyde Att such a place by the forrest syde. Pendragon had wonder thoe, &amp; Vther, his brother, alsoe; Pendragon bade his brother gent, To the seege to take good tent, That king Anguis scaped not away, Neither by night nor yett by day, Till they were of him wreake, For he wold goe with Merlyn speake. Then Pendragon with barrons 5 Went forth alsoe belyue; And when Pendragon was forth went, Merlyn anon, verament, Wist full well, that he was gone, &amp; to Vther he came anon; As itt were a stout garson, He came to Vthers pauillyon &amp; said: âVther, listen to mee, For of thy harme I will warne thee, For I know well, with outen fayle, All king Anguis counsaile, For he will come this ilke night With many a man full well dight &amp; into the forrest slippe anon, For to waite thee for to sloen; But her of haue thou noe dowbt, But warne thy host all about, That they be armed swithe &amp; weele, Both in iron &amp; eke in steele, &amp; gather together all thy host &amp; hold yee still with outen bost, Till that hee bee amonge ye comen, For he shalbe the first groome, That shall vpon thy pauillion ren; &amp; looke, that thou be ready then, &amp; heard on him looke thow hewe &amp; spare not that old shrewe, For thou shalt slay him with thy hand &amp; winne the price from all this land!â &amp; when he had told him all this case, He vanished away from that place. Great wonder had Vther thoe, That he was escaped soe, &amp; thought, itt was gods sonde, That warned him that stonde, That had soe warned him of his fone &amp; was soe lightlye from him gone. &amp; when itt drew vnto the night, King Anguis anon right Did arme his men wrath &amp; prest, 3000 men of the best, &amp; said, how a spye had tolde, That Pendragon, the prince bold, Forth into the country is gone &amp; left his brother Vther att home; Therfore, he sayd, he will out breake, &amp; on Vther he wold him wreake, &amp; sware an othe by Mahound, He wold kill him in his pauillyon. &amp; soone they were ready dight; Then king Anguis, anon right Forthe of the castle he can ryde With 3000 by his syde, &amp; forthe he went without bost, Vntill he came to Vthers host. &amp; when he was comen right, Where Vthers pauillyon was pight, King Anguis, a fell felon, He hyed him to the pauillyon &amp; thought to slay Vther therin; But he was beguiled thorrow Merlyine, For Merlyne had that ilke morrow Warned Vther of all the sorrow, How king Anguis was bethought; Therfore in his pauillyon was he nought, But had taken the feild with out With many a hardye man &amp; stout. &amp; Vther was a hardy man; Vpon king Anguis hee ran &amp; smote him att the first blow, That he cane him ouerthrowe; &amp; Vther, with his sword soe smart He smote him thorrow the hart &amp; hent him by the head anon &amp; stroke itt from the necke-bone. And when the Sarazens this can see, Fast away can they flee To the castle euereche one &amp; left their lord all alone; But, or they might scape againe, 500 were all slayne Of the stoutest, that were there, That came with their king ifere. Now let we him be for a season, &amp; let us turne to Pendragon, That was gone to the forrest wilde, To speake with Merlyn the chylde. The first time he asked for Merlyn, He see a heardsman keeping swine, With an old hatt vpon his head, &amp; in gray russett was he cladd, And a good staffe in his hand, &amp; a white whelpe him followande; Stalworth he seemed &amp; well made. The prince anon to him roade &amp; well fayre he can him fraine, Giff he heard ought of Merlyn, &amp; whether hee cold tell him any tythinge, Where was his most wininge. âYea, sir,â he sayd, âby seint Marye, Right now was Merlyn here with mee; &amp; thou had comen eare, indeed, Thou might haue found him in that stead; &amp; if thou Merlyn ken can, He is not yett far gone; &amp; therfore ryde forth in this way, As fast as euer thou may, &amp; on thy right hand rathe Thou shalt find a verry faire path, That thorrow the faire forrest lyeth, &amp; in that way thou ryde swithe, &amp;, seekerlye, with outen weene, Soone thou may Merlyn seene.â Then was the prince glad &amp; blythe &amp; sped him forth swithe; &amp; as he hard, soe he itt found, A well faire path on his right hand. They turned their horsses euereche one, &amp; in that path they rydden anon, &amp; with Merlyn they metten then, &amp;, as itt were a stout chapmon, He bare a great packe on his backe; &amp; to him the prince full faire spake &amp; asked him, if hee see Merlyn: âYea,â said he, âby seint Martin, A little heere before your sight; He is not farr, I you plyght; To you I say, by seint John, He is not yett far gone, &amp; therfore ryde forth beliue, As fast as your horsses may driue, &amp; yee shall find him in a wyle, By then yee haue rydden a myle; With Merlyn yee shall meete then, Or yee shall speake with some other man, That shall you tell full right, Where you shall haue of Merlyn a sight!â &amp; when he had thus sayd, They pricked forth in a brayd; &amp; by they had rydden a stonde, As he him said, with out wronge, He mett with Merlyn on the playne, As he were a doughtye swaine, All cloathed in robes soe gay, As it had beene a monke gray, &amp; bare a gauelocke in his hand; His speeche was of another land. He, when the prince had him mett, Faire &amp; hendlye he did him greete. Then the prince was all heauye &amp; asked him of his curtesie, If he mett by the way With chyld Merlyn that day. âYea, sir,â hee said, âby seint Michaelle, Merlyn I know verry well, For right now, sikerlye, Merlyin was here fast by, &amp; had yee rydden a litle bett, With Merlyn yee might haue mett; But, sir, I say with out othee, He is a quante boy, for soothe; Soe well I know Merlyns thought: With out my helpe you find him nought; &amp; if of him yee will haue speech, Then must you doe, as I to you teache: Att the next towne here beside, There you must Merlyn abyde &amp; in the towne take your ine; &amp;, certainly, then child Merlyn Shall come to you this ilke night, &amp; there yee shall of him haue sight, &amp; then yee may both lowed &amp; still Speake with Merlyn all that you will!â Then was the prince blythe &amp; glad &amp; pricked forth, as he were madd, &amp; tooke his inne in the towne, As shold a lord of great renowne. Now may you heare in this time, How Merlyn came the 5?? time, &amp; how he the prince mett, &amp; on what manner he him grett &amp; became to him as councellour: Hearken to me, &amp; you shall heare! When itt was with in the night, Merlyn came to the king full right, Right in the guise of a swayne, As he was in the forrest seene, &amp; sayd, as I find in the booke: âSir prince, god send you good lucke! Loe, I am heere, that thou hast sought: Tell me, what is thy thought, &amp; what thou wilt to me saine, For I wold heare thee wonderous faine!â Then vpstart Pendragon &amp; into his armes he him nume; To bide with him he did him craue, &amp; what hee wold aske, he shold haue. &amp; Merlyn sayd, verament, He wold be att his commandement; Ouer all, where soe he were, He wold be att his bydding yare. Then was the prince gladd &amp; blyth &amp; thanked Merlyn many a sythe; Then sayd Merlyn: âSir, will you heare? I come from thy brother deere; For through my councell hee hath this night Slaine king Anguis, I you plight.â Then was the prince blythe &amp; gladd &amp; great solace &amp; myrth made; &amp; all, that were there, were full faine, &amp; on the morrow rod home againe &amp; found king Anguis slaine, His head sett vp, his body drawne. Pendragon asked Vther, iwis, Who had slaine king Anguis, &amp; he answered and can saine, That he was warned by a swayne. When he had told all, how he did, He thanked god in that steade. Then bespake Pendragon &amp; sayd to Vther anon: âHee, that thee holpe att need thine, Forsooth, itt was child Merlyn, That standeth now here by thee.â Vther him thanked with hart free &amp; prayd him then, in all thing That he wold be att his bidding. Then they wenten to the castle, with out lesse, Wherein many a Sarazen was, That noe man might to them winne By noe manner of gynne; &amp; therfore the oste still lay, Till after vpon the 3? day Word came from the Sarazen, Where they lay in castle fine, That they wold yeeld vp the castel, If they might passe well To their land with outen dere; Vpon a booke they wold sweare, That they shold neuer againe come. But Merlyn sent them word soone, That they shold passe eache one By leaue of sir Pendragon. &amp; when they had all sworne &amp; some, That they wold neuer in this land come, They passed anon to the sea strond &amp; went into their owne land. Then to Pendragon the crowne they name, &amp; king of Englande he became, &amp; in England he raigned king But 3 yeere, with out leasing, &amp; after he was slaine rathe With Sarazens, &amp; that was scathe; I shall you tell, in whatt manner: Listen a while &amp; you shall heare! That time in the land of Denmarke 2 Sarazens where stout &amp; starke, &amp; were of king Anguis kinde, Of his next blood, that was soe hynde; The one was come of the brother, &amp; of the sister came the other. Strong men they were &amp; fell, &amp; theire names I can you tell: The one was called sir Gamor, &amp; the other sir Malador. Gamor came of the brother beforne, The other was of the sister borne; Great lords were they of land: Sir Malador held in his hand 2 duchyes, &amp; Gamor 3; Stowter men might none bee. When they heard, how king Anguis In England was slaine, iwis, Altogether can they speake, Theire vnckles death they wold wreake; &amp; soe great an oste together they brought, That the number I can tell nought; But vnto shipp they gone anon, &amp; the sea to flowe began, The winde soe well began to blow, That they landed att Bristowe. Then Merlyn knew itt well anon &amp; told itt Vther &amp; Pendragon, How there was comen from Denmarke A stronge oste, stout &amp; starke, With many Sarazens of price, For to auenge king Anguis. âIn England,â sayd Merlyn then, âSuch an oste was neuer seene; I say to you, with outen layne, The one of you shalbe slayne; &amp; whether of you soe ere it is, Shall haue to meede heauens blisse.â But for noe meede he wold not saine, Whether of them shold be slaine; But neuer the lesse yee shall heare, Merlyn loued well Vther, The least heere, that was on his crowne, Then all the body of Pendragon. Hee bade them dight them anon, Against their foemen for to gone, &amp; sayd, Pendragon, with out fayle, Vppon the land shold them assayle: &amp; Vther, alsoe I bidd thee, Thou shalt wend by the sea &amp; looke, that theere scapen none, Till they be slaine euerye eche one!â Pendragon was a doughtye knight &amp; fell &amp; egar for to fight; He neuer for stroakes wold forbeare Against noe man, with sheeld or speare, Nor better did non, with outen fayle, &amp; that was seene in that battaile: He tooke his oaste with might &amp; mayne &amp; went the Sarazens fast againe; &amp; when they were together mett, There were strokes sadlye sett; Many a heathen Sarazen He cloue downe to the chin, Many a man was sticked tho, &amp; many a good steed was slayne alsoe. The booke saith, with outen lye, There was done such chiualrye, Of the folke, that Pendragon fell, Noe man can the number tell. &amp; Vther to the sea went, &amp; Merlyn told him, verament, That he shold not that day be slaine. Then was Vther wonderous fayne &amp; in his hart soe wonderous lyght, That hee was feirce &amp; fell in fight, &amp; egerlye, with out fayle, The Sarazens he can assayle &amp; fast against them can stryde, That many a Sarazen lost their liffe. Pendragon &amp; his folke, in hast The Sarazens fast to ground they cast, That there were none, against them stoode, But fledd away, as they were wood. But Vther in that ilke tyde Kept them in on the other syde; With strong battayle &amp; strokes hard He droue them all againe backward; &amp; when that they noe further might, On Pendragon can they light, A 100 Sarazens on a rowte Att once layd him all about. Who soe had seene Pendragon then, He might haue seene a doughtye man, For all, that he might euer reach, Trulye, they need noe other leech. The Sarazens stout &amp; grim Slew his steed vnder him; &amp; when hee had lost his steed, Great ruthe itt is in bookes to reede How that he on foote stood, Till that he lost his harts bloode. A 100 Sarazens att a brayd All att once att him layd &amp; broken him body &amp; arme &amp; slew him there, &amp; that was harme. &amp; when that Vther vnderstoode, His brother was slaine, he waxt neere woode &amp; bade his men fast fight, &amp; he bestirrde him like a knight; Of all the Sarazens, that were left aliue, There scaped noe more but 5; Of the christian men were but slane 3031, certane; &amp; in that ilke country thoe A mile might noe man goe, Neither by dale nor by downe, But he shold tread on a dead man. And when itt was against the night, Vther had discomfited them in fight; He went home into his inne &amp; asket councell of Merlyne. Pendragon was out sought &amp; to the church full fayre brought; He was grauen &amp; layd full merrye In the towne of Glasenburye, &amp; thus ended that doughtye knight: God grant his soule to blisse soe bright, &amp; all, that done soe for the right, I pray Jesu for his might, He grant them heauens blisse aboue! Amen, Amen, for his mothers loue!</field>
