The love of thee, in wild Beasts have been known, And Birds have lik'd thy Notes above their own: How easie might thy Errours be excus'd, Wer't thou as much belov'd, as th'art abus'd? Yet although dull soules, thy Harmony disprove, Mine, shall be fixt, in what the Angels love. W. D. Ad Lectorem. Catches are Catches, be they better or worse, And these may prove hopefull if not spoyl'd at Nurse: It's therefore desired if any doe halt, That the Iudicious may set right the Fault, In time by this meanes, they may walke without Crutches, And merrily please you for your Charge, which not much is.
