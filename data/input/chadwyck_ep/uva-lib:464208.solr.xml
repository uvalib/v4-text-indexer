And here-vpon that he paye his Rente, As the statute and the custome bonde; That is to saye, that he brynge in his honde A large peny, enpryntede with the name And the ymage, of the emperour.

And aftir that, I fynde ferthermore, His name was regestrede and Inamede there, Perpetually forto be in mynde. And this discryvyng, if ye luste to here, Was made firste in Cyrye, as I fynde, By one Cirynus, the peple for to bynde, To be to Rome ay in subiecion.

The Regne of Heroude xxx?? yere and one, Whan made was the discripcion, As ye haue herde, that Ioseph must gone To Bedeleem for conclusion, To pay his tribute in his owne towne, As the statute afore dothe specyfye; Because that he and also eke Marye Werne of the householde and of the trybe borne Called Iuda, and of the kynrede Of worthy Dauid, as I haue sayde to-forne. And on her Iournay, as thay gan thayme spede, And holy Ioseph dyd hir brydill lede, Sodenly marye full sone she abrayede, And vnto Ioseph evyn thus she sayde: “I wys,” quod she, “me thynkyth þat I see Two folkys gretly discordyng, Vpon the waye aperen vnto me. The tone Reioysysng, that othir compleynyng.” To whome Ioseph benyngly lokyng, Ansewerde agayne and bad hir Ryde in pees; And prayed hir also nat to be reccles, Any wordys for to speke in vayne, But holde hir way and hir Iournay Right. And vnwarly, aforne hem in the playne, Apered an Angell with face sterne and bryght Of whome the beaute ?af a plesant lyght, The place envyron and a sote odoure. And his clothyng like the lely floure Was whit in sothe, as snowe that fallith newe; Whiche gan a-noon chere and loke to meve, And ther-with-all, with a chaunged hewe, By-gan also Ioseph to repreve. And shortly bad his wordes that he leve, And sayde, in sothe, that he was to blame For to be bolde any wordes to atame Ayens Marye; thorough his necligence To saye that she spak any worde in vayne. For that she sawe was non apperance, But verrey sothe as she hath it seyne. “For truste me well and be right certeyne, Of this folke of whiche she spake to the, In sothefastenesse, lyche as thou shalt see, Ben the peoples and the folke? tweyne, That ben disceuerde in full large space: The ton of Iues, that wepe shull and pleyne, With many atere distyllyng on his face; That wilfully shall refuse his grace, Of frowarde hert for to be benyng, To devoyde and playnely to Resygne The Sinagoge, with hir Rite? olde, Whiche in shorte tyme shall drawe to declyne, And hir phares quenche and waxen colde With sacrede light, that were wonte to shyne. For tyme is come þat they must fyne, Ande the weylinge of her derked chere Vncloos shall and shewe al bryght and clere, As phebus dothe at mydday in the sowthe, Whan euery Rakke and euery cloudy skye Is voyde clene, so hir face vncouthe Shall shewe in opyn and fully ben vnwry. And the peple whiche that marye Reioysyng say for yoye and gladnesse, Ben paynymes þat mekely shall hem dresse, This tyme of grace fully to obey, With hert and will, and full humble chere. For goddes worde that no man maye withsaye Hath hastyd it gon ful many a ?ere, To Abraham and Isaak in-fere, And to Iacob, that in hir holy seede, Full hastely, who so luste take hede, Shall al peples pleynly blissede be, Thorugh-oute the worlde in euery londe and realme.” And with that worde, as Ioseph myght see, The Angell sty above the sonne beame. And he gothe furthe tawarde Bedlem, With marie, til that thei bothe tweyne, In full lytyll space gonnen to atteyne To the boundes of bedleme the cite, Wery and mate sumdel of her viage; Where thay founde of peple seche plente In the Cyte, of euery manere age, That thay myght haue nomaner herbygage In all the towne, nethir boure ne hall, Save a stable and a lytyll stall, That were sequestrede and set asyde Oute of all prees, the story saythe expresse, Made for beste?, sothely into abyde, Ful straite and narewe, schadewid with derknesse. Into whiche Ioseph gan hym dresse With Marye, to reste ther all nyght. And as she entrede, a newe soden light Gan the place enlumen envyron, That shone as bright as eny someres day, So that this lityll humble mancion Was fresche of light as phebus is in may; Whiche gan to waxen and encrece aye While she was there, all-be þat it was nyght. And right anoon, the sothefaste sonne of myght, Of all our Ioye, caste hyme to aryse And shed his light to glad all man kynde. For tawarde mydnyght, shortly to devyse, Whan all was huste, holy wryt makyth mynde, As softely as he dyd hym wynde In the sydes, of this holy mayde, So easely this newe sonne abrayde, Whan he was borne in to this mortall lyfe, Vpon the erthe to shede his bryghtnesse, Withoutyn helpe of any mydwyfe, Or of his mothir, travell or sekenesse. For she that firste conceyved in clennesse, It sat right wele that she shulde also With outyn trayvell or eny manere woo, For to go quyte at hir delyueraunce, And specially haue aprerogatife, In hir childyng to fele no penaunce, Sithe she was bothe mayde, modir, and wife, Chosyn of god for to stynte our stryve, Of all wymen, by hir self aloon. Wherfore it sat not hir for to crye and grone Lyke oþer wemen þat ben inli sike, In the tyme of hir trvelyng. Wherfore sithe she was to noon othir lyke, No payne felte the houre of hir chldyng. And, as I fynde, at hir delyueryng Ther was no wight but hir self aloon; For þylke tyme Ioseph was out goone, [[XXXVII]] Howe Iosephe went to seke Mydwyfe? to our lady Ca? xxxvii ?? In full gret hast to enquere and seke Some Mydwyfe to helpe in this nede. And in this while, with hir eyne meke, She childed hath, this floure of maydynhede. And home agayne, as Ioseph gan hym spede, And to the place the mydwyfe? brought, Evyn at the dore abasshede in theyr thought, Stoden styll astonyed of that light, And þe bri?tnesse þat schone in þe place, A?en kynde, þat tyme of the ny?ght, That thay ne myght susteyne in her face And no wondre, for the sonne of grace, Within whiche cast his light so ferre, Of whome the mone and eche othir sterre Receyven her light, euerech in her spere, Al be þat he lay here in erthe lowe, In a stable with his sacrede chere, Sool with his mothir that no man dyd knowe; On whome hir loke she mekely gan to throwe, Gudly biholdynge his fayre ?onge face, And knelyng downe began to enbrace His tendre lymmes in hir Armes tweyne, And wrappede hym in clothes tendrely, Ande toke him up and sooftly gan him leyne In hir lappe; and full humbly She be-helde his feturs by and by, So fayre shapen in party and in all. And with hir mylke, verrey celestiall, And hevenly licour of hir pappes small, His tendre lymmes she sprede in euery coste,— The white bavme to make it avale, Fette fro the condyth of the holy goste, Vpon the thyng that se loved moste; And gaffe hym souke of the pyment sote, That sprange and grwe oute of the holy Rote Of maydenhede, and fro the chaste vyne Of all clennesse, was itryede oute. Wher-with she made hir yong chylde to dyne, Whom hevyn and erthe muste obeye and loute, Albe that he, with beste? hym aboute, Lay humbly, as ye haue herde devyse, And aftir this his mothir dyd aryse And lyft him up, sooftly in-to the stalle Where-as the asse and the oxe stode. And on hir knees she gan a-noon to falle, And worshipped hym, this beste of all gode, That gyvethe to Angel and to man his foode. And than this mayde, with debonayre chere, Withe face erecte and handys eke in-fere, [[XXXVIII]] A deuote prayer that our lady made whan criste was borne Ca? xxxviii 4. To god above by-gan thus for to pray: “O lorde,” quod she, “with all my full myght To whom iche thynge iustely must obeye, To the be thanke, as it is skyll and right, That thou so goodly luste to haue a sight To my mekenesse, though I vnworthe be. And not dysdeygne of thy benyngnyte, To graunte only of thyn high goodnesse, Me to encrece vnto suche excellence, To be a mayde and mohtir in clennesse, To bere thy sonne and eke thy sapyence, That neuere twynnyth oute of thy presence, But in heven abydythe aye with the, And in erthe mekely nowe withe me, Lyeth in a stall, of chere moste debonayre, To-fore my face, my Ioye and my comforte; Whiche with þe lokynge of his i?en faire Is hool my gladnesse, and fully my disporth, Sothefaste pleasaunce and my chefe resorte; My dere sonne, and my childe also, To who with hert and all that I can do, I thanke the, lorde, that liggiste me beforne, That thou luste chese to haue affection Of me so mekely in erthe to be borne, And fro thy fadre to descende dovne, Only for helpe and our savacion Of all mankynde frely of thy wille.

And Salomee deuoutly gan hir dresse Towarde the childe, and on hir knees felle, And sayd: “O lorde, that power haste of all, So latte thy mercy goo[d]ly on me sprede, Me for to socoure nowe in this grete nede; Me wrecchede wight, pun[i]schede Rightfully, And loste for euere, saue only thy grace.

Firste howe that god, to save that was for-lore, Lowly in erthe luste to be bore; And howe a mayde in hir virgynyte, Might also childe and mothir be. The whiche thynges passen and transcende Reason of man by kyndes likenesse. But faythe alone muste all comprehende, And it enbrace by perfyte stablenesse, And make his grovnde vpon the witnesse Of prophetes, whiche in hir prophecye, So long aforne gan to clepe and crye Aftir the comyng of this myghty kyng, Our olde woo and trouble to enchace; Domine ostende faciem tuam et salui erimusTo whome Dauid sayde in his wrytyng: “O blisfull lorde, shewe to vs thy face, And we in sothe, only thrugh thy grace, Shall saved be from all myscheve and drede; And lorde also, now in our grete nede, Sende vnto vs thy comfortable light, Vs to enlumyne liggyng in derkenesse.” YsaieEke ysaye, with all his Inwarde sight, Vp vnto hevyn gan his loke to dresse, And seyde, “lorde, of þi gret goodnesse, Oute of deserte, from the harde stone, Vnto the dougthir dwellyng in Syon, Sende dovne thy lambe fulfilled with mekenesse, That lordship hathe and domynacion Of all the herthe, our dool to Redresse. And wolde god for our saluacion, This myghty lorde for to come adovne, The high hevens wolde breke entweyne, Vs to Releve of that we so compleyne.” And Dauid eke spake this lorde vnto, In the sauter our sorowes for to fyne, And sayde, “lorde in Relees of our woo, The high hevens thy mercy make enclyne And downe discende, and late thy grace shyne Vppon vs wrecches in the vale of sorowe.” And, “lorde, do dawe thyne holy glad morowe,” Quod Salamon. “and shewe to vs thy light Of thy mercy and Rewe on our distresse, And with thy vertues, that ben so moche of myght, That no man may counte hem ne expresse; Fulfille Syon, and with high gladnesse Thy people hertes make for to renewe, That thy prophetes, may be founde trwe;” Which all at onys with hert wille and thought, Aftir this day so longe dyden crye: “O come thou lorde, and ne tarye nought.” And of this day, in hir prophecye Wrote some tyme holy ?akarye, Byddyng the dougthir of Syon to be light; Where he also assured and be-hight To Iherusalem that is a myghty kyng Shall come in haste his peple to visite; ?akarie And he shall bryng pees in his comyng, Of whome the power shall not be alyte, Potestas eius A mare vsque ad mare For it shall laste, as hym luste to wryte, From see to see, and all the erthe sprede, Thorugh the worlde bothe in lengthe and brede. And Baruk bad to Iherusalem Baruk vi To by-holde, in all his beste entente, Tawarde the brightnesse of the sonne beme, Circumspicite Iherusalem ad orientum And wysely loke into the oryente, To see the gladnesse that this day is sent Dovne to the erthe, nowe that Criste is bore. Of whose commyng, so many a day affore, Spake ysaye, and sayde in wordes playne: “The high hevynes dothe your grace adewe.” And sayde also, the Skyes sholde Reyne Rorate celi desuper nubes pluant Iustum Isaie xlvVpon erthe, her moystur for to shewe; And bad the grovnde, eke in wordes fewe, For to open and thorowe throwe his heuenely showre, For to buryovne our alther savyour. IeremyeAnd Ieremye spake eke of this day, And sayde that god shulde make seed A greyn of Dauid, fayrer then floure in may, Whiche in freshenesse shall euere spryng and sprede, And conseruen Iuda oute of drede, And eke Israel kepe in sekyrnesse. And he shall make, all Rightwysnesse Vpon the erthe, of high and lowe degre. And Rightewisnesse men shall his name call, When he is comyne to sytte in the see Of kyng Dauid in his riall stalle. And he also, to-fore the prestes all, Bothe of Iuda and levy, shal devyse With newe encence to do sacryfyce To god aboue, for the grete offence Of the peple, and for her ignoraunce; With his offerying make Recompence, Or that the swerde be whette of vengeaunce. Even like as made is Remembraunce In Malachie in the same wyse,— This sonne of life shall spryng and Ryse To all tho that hym loue and drede, And ben expectant with al humylite On his comyng, to suche he shall oute shede His light of grace at his natyvyte. Wher-fore be gladde, lyke as byddyth Miche, Thou Bedlem called Effreta, Though thou be lityll namede in Iuda; For oute of the shall procede a-none The myghty kyng and lorde of Israel. And nowe this day is corven oute of a stone, Withouten handes of that holy hylle, Of whiche whilome, the prophete Danyell, In his bokes wrote so long aforne, To signyfye that there sholde be boren A childe, in sothe, withoute touche of man, Of a mayde, aftir his be-heste; That like a stone was ycorven oute than, Whan he was bore in this high feste, Only to breke the crovne and eke the creste In Babylyne of the grete ymage That made men firste, to done outerage. For nowe, in sothe, comyn is the day, Of prophetes so longe aforn be-hight, For Criste Ihesu, playnely this is no naye, Is thilke stone, who so loke a-right, Whiche by his wisdome and his faders myght, And the vertu of the holy goste, Was corven oute so clene in euery coste, Of that blissede perfyte holy hill That groweth full of holsome floures fayre. For oute of hir that was in hert and wille A perfyte mayde, humble and deboneyre, Lyche as the dwe of heven dothe repayre Vpon Ermon, al-waye newe and newe, Amendyng aye the herbes of her hewe, Right so thorugh vertu lastyng ay in one Of the holy goste, this day of marye Was corven oute, the sothefaste angle stone, Whome that prophetes pryse and magnyfie. For she this day was the gladde skye, Whiche the childe of helye dyd see So plesauntly ascende from the see Vppon the erthe, nakede and bareyne Of holsome frute and of herbes soote, That hathe shede the comfortable Reyne, The Reyne of grace, for our alther boote, That percede hath, even to the Rote Of our welfare, to do the levys spring. For she alone is the felde flouryng, That sumtime ?af so passynge a swetnesse To Isaak, whan he was fall in age; Of whiche he caught so inwardely gladnesse, That hym thought holy his corage Renewede was, and with a glad visage, Unto Iacob of hertely Ioýe sayde,— On his clothis, as he his handes layde,— [[XLVI]] Howe Ioseph prophicied the birthe of criste betouchyng of the clothe? of his sonne Iacob Ca? xlvi? 12? Myne owne childe, and my son dere, The grete Swetnesse and the fresshe odour Of thy clothyng to me is so entere, That it frome me devoydyth all langoure;” Sayeng tofore that there shulde a floure Oute of the felde springe of his kynrede, The whiche shulde suche an odour shede, That all the worlde shall comforte fynde and hele In the swetnesse a?ens iche maledie, And soueraine helthe in euery myscheve fele; So that this felde was no wight but marye, That by discent come of his alye. Oute of whiche to gladen all our chere, This day in erthe ther dyd a floure apere,— The Sweteste yet that evere man be-helde, Passing the Rose and the floure delys. And of this holy, fayre, fresshe felde, Sumtyme þe spouse spak in canticis, Whan he it sawe so fresshe at his devys, And habundaunt of a tempre eyre, And þat it was so passing Inly fayre. [[XLVII]] How the Garnet appull is likened to our lady Ca? xlvii? 13? O howe the bawme of hevenly lycoure Of thy Swetnesse, with souereygne suffisaunce, Lyke Paradys shedith his vapoure Erly on morew, avoydyng all grevaunce, Lyche the frute that is of suche pleasaunce,— The garnet apull, of colour golden hewed, Thurgh whose odour the corage is renewed Of euery wight, that may the eyre Receyve. For evyn like as the golden Rynde Is playne and shynyng, as ye may conceyve, His colour kepyng euere in one by kynde, And dothe his pypens in the skalis [bynde], To do comfort to seke in her accesse,— Right so maye, our sekenesse to redresse, This day hath borne the holsom holy frute, The frute of lyffe, that with his soote brethe Is remedye, and also cheve Refute To mankynde, a-gayne the fever of dethe. For as the grayne of the Garnet slethe Þe stronge accesse and doith þe hete avale, Right so this day, oute of the golden scale, The holsome pepyn and the grayne of lyve, Criste Ihesu, gan firste to apere; And of marye, mothir, mayden, and wyffe The golden garnet with his scales clere, Beyng al hole and iliche entere, Was borne, in sothe, for to refresche blyfe Our olde accesse. and right as the Olyfe His oyle shedyth, and braunche leffe ne tre Apeyreth nat of fayrenesse ne coloure, Right so marye, flouryng in chastite, This day hath borne our alther saviour, The oyle of pees to stynte our langour, To softe our sores, and the Swellyng slake Of all owre wondes, whanne thay smerte or ake. And nowe this daye, shortely for to wryte, This blisfull tyme of the Natyuyte, Of yonge Ioseph, The coote polymete, Wrought by power of all the trynyte, Within the closet of chosin chastite, Performede was, and by noo hande of man, Alex super canticaAs Alysaundre wel reherse can, With-in his boke, made in speciall On cantica, as ye may Rede and see. The which clothe of purpur moste Ryall, Hewede with clennesse of virgynyte, This day hathe shewede in our humanyte The godhede hole, for by this clothe is mente Of our kynde the frele garnemente. [[XLVIII]] Howe Ioseph figurede the birthe of Criste Ca? xlviii? 14? Also this day of Ioseph the gauell, Amydde the felde that dothe the vertu floure, Was gadrede vp by clennesse euery dele; Whom all the other gan worship and honour. For in the chaste, clene, chosin boure Of maydenhede, this gavel grwe by kynde; That whan the bretherne of Ioseph dyd bynde Eueryche his chefe, the byble can deuise, How it stode vp a monge hem euerychone; And all that othir gan at onys ryse, And worshippede it mekely one by one. For this Ioseph sawe this day a-lone, Sonne and mone and sterres eke xi?, To hym obeye vppon the high hevyn. And sothefaste garner of this holy grayne, GuydoAs saythe Guydo, was a mayde swete, In whome was shet, sothely for to sayne, The sacrede store and eke the halowede whete Of the vii? yere that dyd in plente flete. For on this parfyte Rote that is so vertuouse, The vii? yeres of grayne so plentevouse This day ben growe to full perfection, To saue Egypt in his grete nede; And for to be to hym savacion In scarcyte whan that he hathe nede. For this is the grayne that shall fostre and fede, With full repaste to woman, child and man, And all his brethern dwellyng in Canaan. This yonge Ioseph, this Ioseph the secunde, Shall by his witte helpe and Releve, And Iacob make in plente to habounde With fulsom fode, at morew and eke at eve, That the hungre on no syde greve Of the vii? yere vnto his lynage. And like as Iosephe, in his tendre age, Thought he sawe high vp in the hevyn Sonne and mone in his avysion, And ther with all sterres eke elleven, Honour hym by grete devocyon, So this Ioseph, excellyng of Renoun, This newe Iosephe, criste Ihesu hym-self, Of the sterres and the signes twelfe, Honourede was with low subiection, Though he lay lowe in an oxe stall. For bothe troni and dominacion, And holy the curte above celestiall, This high feste for a memoriall, The laudes songen in the hevynly quere; Lyke as Dauid bad in the sauter: “Preysyth the lorde, of the high empere,” And with o voys his birthe gloryfieth, That hathe with loue brent and set afyre. Seraphin wherfore hym magnyfieth, Atwene two bestes though he in erthe lyeth, Full humble thurgh his humylite, And nowe this feste of the Natyvite, The high Angels and virtutes all, Presith hym as thay ben wonte to done. And lete the swetnesse of your notes fall Dovne to the erthe, wher goddes awne sonne This day hathe ioye with vs to wonne, And lithe now wrappede in his mothir barme; Whome wel softely with hir holy Arme, And with the fayrenesse of hir fyngers white, Hir yonge childe mekely dothe embrace, And so moche in hert dothe delite His tendre lymmes to welden and compace, Ande to biholde the goodlyeste face, That euere was forged by nature. For it was he, I dar yov well assure, Whome she behelde with her eyne meke, That from eterne was in his faders [thought] And oon with hym, who can take kepe, His owene worde that al made of nou?t, Whome a mayde hathe to mankynde brought, Thorugh hir mekenesse of hevyn and erthe quene, The lyneall stok of Iuda to sustene. Iacob in libro de testimentis xiiWhome that Iacob on his fatall day, Whan attropos gan his threde vntwyne, Whiche cloto had put long in delaye, And lachasis, or thay wolde it fyne, Gan to blisse and thus of hym defyne, Whan all his bretherne stoden envyron, This olde gray, with a full softe soun: “O Iuda, Iuda, thy bretherne euerychone Shall prese and worship the high renoun Of thyne estate, which shall of all thy fone The pryde opresse, and make hem loute dovne; That shal be cleped the whelpe of the lioun, The Royall beste whiche, maugre who saythe nay, Shall myghty be to cache and take his pray And proudely bere it home vnto his cave,— My sonne Iuda, in thy dredfull tene, For thorugh thy myght thou shalt victory haue, Maugre echone that the reuers mene. For who shall mowe withstonden or susteyne Thy kyngly power, to make resistence A-gayne thy manhode and thy magnyficence, That shall in the so clerly shewe and shyne Withoutyn clipsyng or any manere clowde; The septre of whome, in sothe, shall neuere fyne, To be famous by Reporte lowe and lowede, Nor neuere sese in couerte ne in shrowde Till a duke aryse of thy kynrede, Whom all the world shall obey and drede. The whiche, in sothe, is for to be sente Ou?t of thi sed by dwe successioun, Liche a kyng to holde his parleamente, With his legees a-mydde his region, And he shall be to euery nacion Sothefaste abydyng and socour in her nede. And he shall bynde his myghty sterne stede, Ipse erit expectacio gencium Of verrey fors, at the holesome vyne; And tye his asse vindir the grapes Rede. Ande he his stole þat lyke to golde doth shine, And his palle, by myght of his manhede, He shall wasshe in grapes that shull blede The Rede blode, depper than skarlet hewe. And thus arayede in his vesture newe, Gen xlix Of loke he shall be sterner to by-holde, Than the stremes of the light sterre; Pulcriores oculi eius vino And of eyne fayrer many folde, Thanne wyn fined shynynge thorowe a verre And like yuoury that comes fro so fer, His tethe shall be evyn smothe and white.” And liche, in sothe, as Ioseph lust endyte, The sonne of Iacob in his testament, Wherto his children he maketh mencion, To-fore his dethe, with full deuoute entent, In his presence as they knelyn adovne, To hem Rehersyng the grete avysion Whiche he had in egipt gone full yore, In a foreste, among the holte? hore,— How that he sawe twelfe hertes white, Full lustely goon in her pasture. LincolneAnd aftir that, as Lincolne liste to wryte, He sawe of Iuda borne a creature, Of thought and dede, a verrey mayden pure. And in his dreme, hym thought he dyd sene Of hir brought furthe, withoutyn spote all clene, A lambe moste fayre to his inspection, That euere he sawe vnto his pleasaunce; On whose lefte hande stode a fyers lyon, And bestes many by one alyaunce, That were in erthe thorugh cruell resemblaunce, Aforsyng hem by sheltroun in batayle, By felle malice, the fayre lambe to assayle. But or that thay avayle myght in fyght, The lambes power made hem for to dye; And hem venquyschede thorugh his humble myght, That man and Angell, when thay this conqueste seye, Thay fell downe streght and the lambe obeye, That was sent of god, this meke werryour, The whiche was borne to ben our savyour, And to mankynde full protection, To sle the lyon, that he may not endure. And acordyng with this avysion, This lambe of god, clad in our armoure, This day was borne of a mayden pure, And lorde of all, here in a lytyll cage, By Right lyne discended oute of the lynage Of the worthy and myghty bretherne two; As a burgeon oute of a stoke growyng, Right so this childe, fro levy and also Frome myghty Iuda, growe oute succedyng, Borne of the blode to be preste and kyng, So entermellyde by succession Of bothe was the generacioun, Tyll the braunches be ronne and so ferre gone, By lyneall cours descendyng as a stayre, Til the kynredes were growe bothe in-to oone, In-to o braunche to haue his repayre,— Þat was preued pleynly to be ayre, The right of levy in presthode to succede; And by Iuste tytle, who so lust take hede, For to be kyng and bere the diademe Aftir his fadre, and to be successoure To worthy Iuda, all Israel to queme, To ben hir prince and myghty gouernoure. And from Iacob this burion and this floure Firste gan spring to Iesse, till it raught And so furthe dovne, till the buddes caught [[XLIX]] Howe nature obeythe to virgynyte Ca? xlix? 15 The holy sydes of a pure virgyne, To bere the frute that shall mankynde save. And nowe this day, the prophecye to fyne, In Bedlem within a lityll caue, Kynde and a mayde suche werre haue, For this matier: howe in a creature Two names myght Iustely, by nature That be contrarie, haue her restynge place, For mayde and mother, shortly for to saye, In o person to-gyder may nat trace, For by kynde the tone moot voyde awaye. But in this case, nature dyd obeye To a mayde, and gafe vp hol her right, Wysely aduertyng she was to feble of myght In this matier to holde champartye With hir that was of face moste benygne. Wherfore she voydyth all Rancour and envye, And humbly hir quarell dothe Resigne. For it were veyne, nature to malingne, Though she of kynde be the Empresse, Ayeyne hir lorde that made hir so maystresse, That she mot nede of necessite In euerythyng to his will obeye, And be ministre vnto his volunte, Sithen of hir myght he berythe hym-self the keye. For vnto hir, by no manere waye, It is no wrong ne no preiudice, Though of a mayde withoutyn synne or vyce, That was so holy and parfite founde at all, He wolde of grace descenden doun full lowe To take the clothyng frele and mortall Of our kynde, to make a burioun growe, That neuere was of man sette ne sowe. But with a worde, and the consentyng Of a mayden, a graffe so burgenyng Of Iuda stok this day gan a-pere, Whan criste was borne of a mayden free. And the fader sent his sonne so dere Dovn to the erthe to make an vnyte, By parfyte love and fervent charyte, Eternally by bonde that may not fayle, Fully assuryng by weddyng and sponsayle, Be-twene his sonne and his chosyn ayre, And holy chirche perpetually to laste. And in a chaunbre, by excellence fayre, Of maydenhede that hym-self caste, The holy knotte and the bounde so faste, So bonden was that it may neuere vntwyne; And of that araye fully to determyne, Where the fest and the weddynge was, In all the erthe, halowede and yholde, In a closet more clere þan verre or glas, Or any byrell bryght to be-holde. For by recorde of patriarkes olde, The chaste chaumbre was within adornede With golde of feith fayre and bright borned, With charite, that yeveth so clere a light To Recomforte all that ben in presence, And with siluere depurede oute so bright, Thorough the high wisdome of gostely sapience, And all the Gemmes that hauen excellence In morall vertu for to shewe and shyne, Þe closet chose so clerli enlumine That of vnclennes ther may noo clipsyng be, So fulsome light is ther of parfytenesse. For ther the violet, men may be holde and se, Of clene entent and of holynesse, Withe Roses strawede, in god to haue swetnesse; Ande with lylies of chastite y-meint, And ther-of colour that neuere wolbe fayent; Wher violettes bytokenyng maydenhede, Like to purpill in signe of victorie. And in this chaumbre full of honeste drede, The chosen closet, the chase oratorye, This day, in sothe, the high kyng of glorye, To shewe his myght, how he for man gan [wyrche], And howe he hathe spousede our mothir holy chirche, And like a spouse he procedyde is Oute of his chaumbre, for to rectifie All that was wronge or in our kynde amys; Wherfore his feste we aught to gloryfye. Full long a-gone, to syng his psalmodye, The kyng Dauid entune dyd his harpe, And withe the tenoures and the trebles sharpe, He to heuene gan en-haunce and ryse This day of dayes, moste worthy and famous. And all prophetes in hir sawes preyse This noble feste, this feste so graciouse; And from hevyn, with voys melodiouse, Angelles full lowe Swiftely dovne a-light, For to honour this holy sacrede nyght,— The nyght of nyghtes, highest of ycheone, Excelling all as in worthynesse. For in this worlde was creature noon,— In hevyn ne herth, nor in sothefastnesse, In lande nor see, that with grete bysynes Her deyuere dyd this nyght, to honour Hym that was borne mankynde to socour. [[L]] Howe the chefe temple of Rome fel doun the nyght of cristes birthe and of othir wondrefull tokens Ca? 1? 16 For on this nyght, by euery creature Was sothely shewed his Natyvyte In Bedleme: how that of a mayden pure A childe was borne, moste souerayne of degre. And firste of all, in Rome the Cyte, His birthe was shewede by myracle. For wall and Roof, tours and pynacle Of the Temple moste famous in the towne, To god of pees that was consecrate, The same nyght to grovnde fel adovne, Pleyne with the erthe, wast and desolate; In whiche temple, moste Riall of estate, The statute stode of myghty Romulous, And at the byldyng, the story tellyth thus, Of this temple, thay of Rome wente To appollo with humble sacryfice, To haue ansewer in hir beste entent, How longe this fane Riall of asyse, So strong bilt, and in so thrifty wyse, That it shulde lasten, and so to endure Ayeyne a-sault of any aventure, Or perturbyng on any maner syde. And he yaf ansewer vnto one and all, Howe this temple with his walle? wyde, With his crese? and batelyng Riall, Shall euere stonde sure withoutyn fall, Vnto the tyme that a mayde childe. And thay a-none that firste made it bilde, Of this answer glade and full credible That this temple euere shulde stande. For hem thought it was inpossible, A mayde euere, othir on see or lande, To haue a childe, and so thay vndirstonde. And thay a-noon yaf the temple a name, By one assente, for the grete fame, And called it, as I can discerne, The Temple of pees with his wallys white; And ther-with-all namede it eterne, And at the entre so thay dyd wryte. But on the nyght, the trouthe to endite, Whan criste was borne of a mayden clene, This temple fel doun endelong the grene, To fulfill the trwe prophecye Of appollo that tolde hem all this thyng. Ande in that place in wurship of marie And of hir sone of heuene and erth kynge, Stant a cherche ful of byldynge. And even like the self same tyme, The grete statute, long or it were prime, Of Romulus that was deifyede, Fell to erthe and braste on peces small; And thogh Romaynes made hym stellifiede, His greate hede for all that dyd avale; Of whome also, the werkeman made a tale That forget it many day affore, And sayde, in sothe, till a childe be bore Of a mayde, it shulde stonde vp-Right, Þis grete ymage, and neuere his hede encline; But he aloute vpon the same nyght, Whan crist was borne of a pure virgyne, Like as the werkemen dyd afore devyne, Ayene the conseyte and the entencion Of that he ment in his opynyon. I fynde also, that the skyes donne, Whiche of custome corteyne so the nyght, The same tyme with a sodeyne sonne Enchasede were, that it wex as light As at mydday, whan phebus is moste bright, To shewe sothely that the sonne of lyfe Was borne that nyght, to stynte all our stryfe. [[LI]] Howe the nyght of cristes birthe a well in Rome ran Oyle Ca? li? 17 And even than, also as bokes telle, In verrey sothe, withoutyn any werre, The selfe tyme in Rome was a well, Of his stremes passyngely entiere To loke vpon as any cristal clere, From his vaynes as it dyd boyle; Of whiche the water chaunged into oyle The same nyght, and to Tybre Ran So large plentee that all myght it see. Of whiche well longe before or than, Al opynly, in Rome the Cytee, Sybelle the wyse, that had souereygnete Of prophecye, playnely wrote and tolde, That the water of this well shulde The same nyght chaunge his lycour Into oyle, and so a day endure, Whan of this worlde was borne the savyour, In Bedlem of a mayde pure. And as I fynde also in scripture, The same day, high in the firmament Towarde the partye of the oryent, Wer seyn thre sonnes lustyly apeer,— Eueryche of hem large Rounde and bright; That caste abrode her fayre beame? clere, Thourgh all the world in euery manes sight. The whiche sonnes drowe lyne Right, Her cours holdyng in hast and that a-noon, Till all thre were Ioynede into oon; To mankynde playnely to declare That he was bore, in whom were founded thre, To encrece our Ioye and also our welfare, Flesshe and soule, and eke the deyte, Knytte all in one by sothefaste vnyte; Which as a sonne, voydyng schoure and shade, Was borne this day all the worlde to glade. [[LII]] Also in rome, as wryghtet innocent, Howe the Senates of Rome wolden haue halden Octouyan her Emperour as for her god Ca? iii? 18 In his cronycle makyng mencion, How the Senates, all by one assent In concistorye, of affection Whiche thay hadde in her opynyon, Vnto her noble and mi?ti Emperour Octouyan, of worthynesse the flour, Wolden Ichone hym haue deyfyede, And callede hym by name Immortall. The whiche thyng when he had espyede, As he that was ful prudent founde at all, To his presence made a-noon to calle Sybelle, that was myrrour of sapyence, Here vpon to here, her sentence; And ther-with-all that she moot dyffyne,— Withoutyn doute of ambyguyte, As fer in sothe as phebus dothe now shyne,— If ther wer any of power more than he, Or peregall vnto his degre, Fro Est to west, here in erthe lowe, In all this worlde that she couthe of knowe. And this was done vpon the selfe day Whan criste was borne in Bedlem by myracle. And she full wysely putte hym in delaye, To yef ansewer makyng a small obstacle; Til at the laste, the fin of hir oracle, Amydde the chaumbre of the Emperour, Stondyng envyron many a Senatour, Was playnely this, with chere and face bolde, “O Emperour, lifte vp a-noon thyne eyne, And loke vp yonder, and se the cercle of golde A-boute the sonne, whiche easi is to asspyen, And ther by-holde, thou maiste it not denyen, A mayde sitte, of beaute moost souereyne, Holdyng a childe in her Armes tweyne.” And right a-noon, as this Octovyan Sawe the childe by clere inspection, Withoute abode, a voys he herde than From a-lofte into the chaumbre doune: “By-holde and se with humble affection, This is the auctor of the high heven, Sette in the sonne, clere as any leven.” Where Sybell all a-brode gan saye To hym a-none, and list not to abyde: “Thy crovne avale, and the childe obeye, Whos face bright the sonne may not hyde. And lat nowe be thy pompe and all thy pryde.” And at oo worde she plattely gan hym telle, The childes myght his power dyd excelle. Whiche thyng whan he gan playnely vndirstande, Of faythefull will and hole herte entere, He knelyde dovne and list no longer stande; And with encens cast in the sencere, He dyd worship vnto the Autere, And to the childe moste excellent of fame, And liste no more vsurpe on hym the name, To be callede, ayenste alle skylle and Right, Wrongfully a god, sithen ther is but one.

Loo howe the lorde and the myghty kyng, That hathe lordship ouere grape and vine, Vnto whose myght euery manere thyng.— Hevyn and erthe,—lowly muste enclyne, Gan braunches bere with fresche floures fyne Araye newe, though thay be seer and olde, In frosty wynter and in wedir colde, As in somer whan phebus is a-lofte, Whan flora Reignyth in may and in aprill, And make blossomes to ben as smothe and softe Amyde Decembre, whan men for colde so chille. Wherefore this feste, frely at his wille,— The nyght I mene, of his Natiuyte,— To shewe his myght in herbe, floure, and tre, He made the vynes, as ye haue herde me sayne, In Engady her bavme for to shede, Whan thay were moste nakede and barayne And oute of season, who so can take hede. Of whiche nyght long afore, I rede That in Egipt the prophete Ieremyee, Full opynly in his prophecye, To the prestes of that kyngdome tolde That the Idoles of her temples alle, With-outyn arest, by myracle sholde Breke her necke? and to grounde falle, Whan a mayde in an oxe stalle Hathe borne a childe, this thyng shall be-tyde. Wherefore the prestes in her fanes wyde, Of verrey faythe and of high credence, Secrely vpon a lytyll stage, Vpon his worde with humble reuerence, Of a mayde let make an Image, And in her Arme, a childe of tendre age; Doyng ther-to in her paynyme wyse, Aftir her Rite?, a manere sacryfise. And on this feste, ay fro yere to yere, Thay were a-waytyng whan it wolde be; Til on a day of happe the kyng cam nere,— The noble, worthy, and wyse Tholome,— Þe whiche þing whanne þat he dide see, A-noon of hem the cause he gan enquere, Why or wherfore the Image was sette there. And thay Ichone, of one entencion Yaffe answer and lust not for to lye. For it was ordenyde of olde tradicion, Shewede to-forne by holy prophecye, In whiche thay dyd faythefully aspye, Vndispeirid the hest shal not varie Of the prophete, awhile though it tarye. And sothefastly, in conclusion, Vpon the tyme of the Natyuyte, The false Idole? in Egipt fel adovne, And al to-braste in pece? moo then thre; To shewe truly that Iborne was hee, Of heven and erthe that hath the Regalye, And shall distroye al false mawmetre. [[LIIII]] Howe Romayns whan thay had dominacion ouere all the worlde made hem an Image and callet it the Goddes Ca? liiii 20 I fynde also, as wryteth Carnotence, In his boke, Policraticon, That whanne Romanes had excellence Of high lordship, so many day a-gone, And that peples and Regnes euerycheone Stoden vnto hym vndir lowe seruage, Fro yere to yere makyng a payage Of a tribute that was customable, To the Empyre of verrey dewte; For whiche the Romanes and Senate honourable, Whan thay flourede in moste felicite, Devysed haue for a grete Ryalte, A-myd her towne in moste worthy place, A large statue, femynyne of face, That maked was of coper and of bras, Large and long, and wonderfull to se, And of entayle devydede the compace. This grete ymage called sholde be Goddes of Rome, and like a maieste, In hir Right hande sholde also holde A large worlde, full sterne to by-holde; Whiche sholde of Roundenesse haue the fygure, To signifie that sche moost glorious, The cyte hathe holy in hir cure, And howe by hir thay were victoriouse. And here vp-on, moste excellent famous, Thay dyd a werke-man seken vp and dovne, It to performe, thorugh oute all the tovne, Till at laste, of happe sucheon thay fynde, That passede all to werke in entyle, And was sotyll bothe of witte and mynde, To werke in metall, and sayde he wolde nat fayle Of this emprise, that may so moche avayle To the cyte, and shortly in this caas, Thorugh his engyne, it performede was So Ryally, þat in the worlde noo man Couthe a-mende it in that ilke tyde. And to by-holde it, many a thousande ran,— So gladde of it the were on euery syde; Till at the laste, one of verrey pryde, Presumptuously gan to cry and call, Ande sayde shortly, the legges were to small So grete a werke longe to susteyne, For lak only of gode proporcion. Wher-of a-noon, with soden Ire and tene, The werke man brent in his opynyon, Rebukyng hym of his presompcion. And sodenly perturbede in his mynde, Answerde ayene, shortly as I fynde, As it had ben halfendele in scorne, And sayde: “frende, if thou canst vndirstande, Til þat a childe be of a mayde borne, I vndirtake þat this werke shall stonde. Thyne hede is dulle on watir and on londe To lak thyng thou canste not a mende.” And the werkeman, sother then he wende, Had of this werke sayde and prophecyede. For on the nyght whan that criste was bore, In verrey sothe, it may not be denyede, Of bras the goddes is broken and to-tore, And all the coste of the werke for-lore. In signe only that the lorde and syre, And myghty kyng of the high Empyre, Was borne that tyme in the lityll towne Of bedlem, of a pure virgyne; To whose power and dominacion, Grete Rome mekely shall enclyne. For erthely lordship nedys muste fyne, With all his pompe and lowte to hym lowe, Whan the power of this kyng is knowe. [[LV]] Howe wyse Sybill tolde to the Senates of Rome the birthe of criste Ca? lv?? 21 And of this tyme, gone full many a yere, Wyse Sibylle, called Tiburtyne, Spake to the Senate full opynly and clere, His dreme expoundyng of the sones nyne; Which thay say all at ones shyne Vpon a nyght, eueryliche full dyuerse,— To hem declaryng playnely in her vers That yche sonne in hir avysions, Whiche on heven were so bright and fayre, Betokenyth sothely the generacions That shall succede, dyuers and contrarye.

Of whiche thyng lykynge no-thyng wele, Certeyne preste? of the Iewes lawe Gan to grocche as thay gafe audience, And bad to hir her tunge to withdrawe, And wolde haue putte hir for angre in sylence; And liste of malise yeve noo credence Vnto noo worde that she spake or sayde, Tille þat she of sodeyne Ire abrayde, And sayde: “O Iewes, blynde with the skye Of ignoraunce and malice indurate, Ye shulle to hym of verrey fals envye Be wykked rebel and obstynate, And aye with hym ye holden shul debate.

And to the gospell firste I gan take hede, Of this day howe luke luste to endyte; Though he therof spake but a lyte, And was full breff and compendious; ?et of this day, so high and gloryouse, He wryte pleynly, and sayth how that a-noon, Aftir the day of the Natyuyte, When viii dayes passed were and gone, The childe was brought with all humylyte To the Temple, louly for to be, As the lawe of Iewes had deuised, The viii day to be circumcisede. And he ther-to mekely dyd obeye. And withe a knyfe made full sharpe of stone, His mothir lokyng with a pytous eye, The childe was corve ther-with all, a-non, That all a-boute the rede blode gan gon BonaventureWithoute a boode, as saythe Bonaventure, That for the payne that he dyd endure, And for sharpnes of the soden smerte, The childe gan wepe þat pyte was to here. Wherfore his mothir, of verrey tendre herte, Oute brast on teres and myght her-self not stere, That all bydewede were her eyne clere, Whan she sawe hym that she louede soo, So yonge, so fayre, wepyng so for woo. But he a-noon in all his passion, For all that he was so yong of age, In manere he had pyte and compassion, To se his modyr so wepe in hir rage; And put his hande vnto hir visage, On mouthe and eyne, passyngly benyngne, And as he couthe goodly made a signe Withoutyn speche, to stynt her wepyng That came to her of motherly pyte. And she full well conceyved his menyng, For poynt to poynt, and than a-noon gan she To loke on hym that was so fayre to see, And his fetures considret by and by, And in her Armes, wonder womanly, Sche toke hym vp and preide him be styll, As of modris is pleinly the manere, And he in all obeythe to her wille, Though he wer yong, and gan to chaunge his chere. And with hir kerchefe she made his eyne clere, On his chekes, in all that euere she may, Ful modurly the ters sche wypte away. [[LXI]] Howe in iiii maner of wyse criste was circumcised as Alquyn saythe Ca? lxi? 2? And lyke as Alquyn wryt, it is devysede That criste Ihesus, who-so luste to see, In four manere was truly circumsisede; Firste of his fader at his Natyvyte, i Withe the knyfe of wilfull poverte; And nowe this day, whiche is not fenyde, ii Eke with a knyf bi þe lawe ordeyned; The thred manere, ye may eke considre, iii How with the knyfe of grete aduersyte, That he was kyt firste whan he cam hyddre, Takyng for vs his humanyte; And alther laste, with full grete cruelte, iiii For vs he suffrede circumcision Vpon the crosse duryng his passion. [[LXII]] How criste suffred circumcision in his chosin peple Ca? lxii? 3? Also in four manere, who-so can take hede, Criste in his chosen by gode inspection, Her in this worlde, with-oute any drede, Of newe he suffreth circumcision. The firste is made by fals detraction i That kytteth away bothe frende and fame, And the shynyng, of her gode name. iiThe secunde is by fals tyrannye, Of suche that haue noo concyence at all, But take the awaye by cursyd Robberye, Vnrightfully, her godes temporall. iiiAnd the thryde is, sothely most mortall: Of herytykes that falsely disobey To holy chirche and to our faythe verrey. iiiiThe fourt is made by effusion of blode, By tyrantes that the body slethe, When thay of malice ayayne the faythe be wode To execute her venyme vp by dethe, To make marters yelden vp the brethe; Whome criste Ihesu, eternally in glorye, Ordeyned hath a palme of victorie. [[LXIII]] How criste shedde his blode V tyme? in his manhode Ca? lxiii? 4? Eke ?V? tymes criste in his manhede Shed his blodely effusion. And alther firste, when he dyd blede iVpon the day of circumcision; And next, in sothe, to-fore his passyon, iiVpon the hyll for anguysche when he swette The rede blode, whiche all his body wette; iii.The thryde tyme, his blode moste vertuouse Gan rynne oute by many a cruell wounde, Whan that he was, this kyng moste graciouse, Of the Iewes to a pyler bounde; iiii.The fourt tyme eke, as it is founde, He spent his blode for our alther goode, v.When he was nayled high vpon the rode; And alther laste, whan Longeus a-ferre, Thorugh his hert, playnely as I fynde, On Caluery hym perced with a spere, That blode and water, as bokes maken mynde, Gan streme dovne to his eyne blynde; By whose vertu a-noon this paynym knyght, Only of grace, recouerede hathe his sight. And in bokes, eke as it is tolde, How the pece of his Incision Was by an Angell, in an vrne of golde To Charles brought in a vysyon. And he a-noon, of grete affection Of this myracle, for the excellence Made it be kept for grete reuerence At aquys grene, but yf bokes lye, Full many yere by revolucion, In a chirche, sothely, of marye. But Clerkes han an oypnyon That in þe day of resurreccion,— Whan criste Ihesu roos fro dethe to lyfe,— The same pece retournede as blyfe To the place where that it cam froo, Sythen that it was, sothely as I fynde, Of his manhede pertenyng therto, And a partye longyng to his kynde; Though it so be that boke? maken mynde That it in Rome is as yet reservede, And yere by yere, whan this fest is seruede, In a chirche, whiche men of custome calle Sancta sanctorum, of olde fundacion, The same day ther, the preste? all Solempynly make a stacion, Whanne alle the peple gon on processioun, Fully in hope the better for to spede, Fro yere to yere, ther thay syng and rede. And ferthermore, the story dothe devyse, The same day, right furthe-with a-noon, In the Temple, as they hym circumcise, He namede was Ihesus of Ichon; The whiche name, long or that agon, Was of the Angell tolde and sayde afore To his modur or that he were bore. [[LXIV]] Howe the peple of god that duke Iosue had in gouernaunce were saved by the stedefaste by leve of the name of Ihesus Ca? lxiv? 5? One to reherse, the grete worthynesse Of this name, whiche may nat be discrivede My wittes been so dull, with rudnesse And in the cheynes of ignoraunce gyvede That I alas, of conyng, am depryvede Thorugh lak of witte, on eny manere wyse To vndirfong, so passyng high empryse For this is the name, who so can discerne Most excellent, and moste of dignyte The name of names, sacred from eterne As saythe Bernarde, who so lust to see Fygured firste, vnto Iosue Thorugh his knyghthode, whan that he shulde lede The peple of god, to saue hem in her nede [[LXV]] Howe the name of Ihesus is moste souerayne medycyne ayenst all manere of maladye Ca? lxv??For this is the name that herte? most desyre; Ther is ther-in so passyngly Swetnesse. For it may best hem with grace enspyre, And with plentee of all gostly richesse. It is comforte and socour in sekenesse, Refute also, reste and remedye To all thoo that felen maladye; Ayenste langour the beste medycyne, In all this worlde that owher may be founde. For this name is so hevenly and dyvyne, That herte? seke it dothe with hele habounde. It curythe sores, it helyth euery wounde, And savethe men fro many a swerde and spere, Wher thay ryde in perel ny or fere. Cap. 6? 4 lib. How thys name Iesus is medycine for all maladyesIt is first wryten in the boke of lyfe, For worthyest and most of reuerence; And it is eke best preseruatyfe Ayene the assaut and the violence Of wykkede eayre, to voyde pestelence. And from the dethe, hem that plenyn sore, Of his vertu to helthe it dothe restore. It is also sothefaste saluacion To all that ben in pouert and in nede; It is defence, it is protection In yche perell and in euery drede. It is also the guerdoun and the mede To hem that ben in exile, of outerage, Repayre fynall of hir pilgrimage. [[LXVI]] Howe the name of Ihesus is likenyd to iiij stremys that refressheth all Realmys Ca? lxvj?? 7? It is the well with the foure stremes, Wher-of Bernard wrytyth in sentence, That thorughe the worlde refressheth al Remys, It is so holsome and of suche excellence. iThe firste he calleth the streme of sapyence, Of whiche the floode most inly is habounde; iiAnd Rightwysnesse he namethe the secounde; iiiAnd the thryde he calleth holynesse, For it excellyth in perfection; iiiiThe fourthe also, as I can well expresse, Is the floode of our Redempcion. iAnd of the firste, in conclusion, Of whiche the streme? bene so fresshe and fyne, Who so loke aright, is holy our doctryne. And of his Right, to make mencion, The holsome welle ay dothe flowe and flete, With mercy medled and remyssion, Tofore his dome his Ire forto lete. And of the thryde, the water is so swete, By gode ensample, who so can disserne, In vertu aye how we shull vs gouerne. And of the foruthe, to speke in speciall, Is all our helthe and our saluacion; For ther-in is our remedye fynall A?enste dethe and full protection; Whos floode sprong oute of cristes passion. And who that liste, by water to atame, He shall it fynde enclosede in this name. Of perfyte Ryches, it is tresourye, Whiche may nat wast but iliche abyde. The fyre it quencheth also of envye, And repressith the bolyng eke of pryde, And thorugh mekenesse setteth Ire asyde. And who that hathe this name in Remembraunce, The spryt of slouthe hym may do no greuaunce. It is also the myghty pavys fayre Ayenst wanhope and desperacion; Cristall schelde of pallas for dispayre, Ther-of to voyde the foule abusion. And who that makyth his inuocacion To this name with hert and stablenesse, It yevethe hym strength, it yeuyth hym sikernesse The cruell fyre and brennyng to with-stande Of lechery and all temptacion. It is refute to fre and eke to bonde, That haue ther-in her hole affection; Whose vertu was to kyng Salamon, Full long afforn in dyvyne oracle, As I fynde, shewede by myracle. [[LXVII]] How prophete? and martirs suffrede deth for the name of Ihesus Ca? lxvii? 8? This is the name of prophete? specifiede In her writynge ande in her boockes oolde; Of aposteles most hyly magnyfied, By whose vertu thay the trouthe tolde. This made also matris to be bolde, And myghtyly like sterne champyons, With stable herte to suffre her passions. By this name they were victoryouse, In her torment pacience to haue. This is the name that ignacious Had in his hert of golde full depe grave; Wher of the Tyraunte gretly gan abave, Whan that he sawe his hert kytte atweyne, And letters newe depicte in euery veyne. This is the name that to confessours Was full repast in her abstynence; This is the name that in sharpe shoures Of flesshely luste was holy her defence. It ?af hem myght to make resistence Ayene synne, and knyghtly to werreye, And to contynue in vertu tyll thay deye. [[LXVIII]] How prophete? preste? and kynges and myghty men were anoynted Ca? lxviii? It is the fest and the sugred foode Of maydenhode and of virgynyte; The oyle of grace, holsom to all gode, Whiche in the lampes of perfyte chastyte, Brynnyng so clere with loue and charyte, That wordly wyndes, boystous in blowyng, Ne may nat quenche the light of his shynyng. This is the name that moste yeveth melodye Vnto the eere, and the swettest son. It is the name of hevynly Armonye, To avoyde synne and all temptacion, With full accorde ayenst dyuysyon. It causeth hertes no langer to debate, That partyde werne thorwe the wrest of hate. This name is Ioye of soroughfull in distresse, Eternall mede of hem that levyn in blisse, Salue vnto hem that langour in sekenesse, Vesture in colde to hem that clothes mysse, Souerayne repaste, hungry for to wysse, For to escape the cruell violence Of nedys swerde, whetted with Indygence. Criste is a name of sothefast sacrament, That first was yeue of holy vnction. And he was callede cryst for this entent. For he for man shuld make oblacion. And for he came for our saluacion, To scour a-waye the rust of all our blame, He hathe of Ihesus worthyly the name. I fynde in boke? of olde antiquyte, In her writinge as clerkis list expresse, How ther wer foure persones, of degre, Some tyme a-noynt for her worthynesse: Some for manhode, som for holynesse, With obseruaunce? and solempnyte, As was covenable vnto her degre. Prophete?, prestes, and thay that beren crovnes As worthy kynges, of euery region, Anoyntede werne, and myghty champions Withe-in palestre thrugh her high renon, Or in Champclos, hardy as lyon, Entre wolde some quarell to darreyne, Singulerly, by emprise of hem tweyne. And crist was all, by reason as I preve, Firste a prophete by holy informacion, And by his doctryne, most worthy of byleve. And he was eke the myghty champyon, That syngulerly for our saluacion Faught with the fende and had of hym victory, Mawgre his myght, and wan the palme of glory. And he was prest, man to reconsile, That bansshede was oute of his herytage; Whom a serpent falsely dyd exile, Of fals malice in a soden rage. And he was borne, only by lynage, To ben a kyng, and by power eterne, When he is crownede, his peple to gouerne. [[LXIX]] How crist Ihesu was bothe prophete, preste, kyng, and myghty Champion Ca? lxix? x? Nowe criste Ihesu, sothefaste prest and kyng, And for mankynde most worthy werryour, Prophete also, ande trewest in leueynge, Be thou our helpe, be thou our socour, And like a kyng, be thou our gouernour And Champyon, to helpe vs in our nede, And like a prophete, to wyssen vs and rede. O criste Ihesu to the I clepe and cry, Fro day to day to helpe vs and releve, And of thy grace, vs wrecches for to gye, That or that thou thy rightwysnesse preve, Lat pite firste þe to mercy meue. And or they swerde of vengeaunce vs manace, Lat reuthe afore thy rightful dome enbrace. For of our helpe thou art the pyler, Ayene dispayre holy our sustynaunce; Our strength, our myght, our refute fer and nere, In yche perell, to save vs, fro myschaunce. Thou art our store, and our suffysaunce And in myscheve, whan drede wolde vs assayle, Thou art our schelde, thou art our supportayle. Thou art myghty, and thou art meke also, And thou art Rightfull, and thou art mercyable, Lambe and lyon, callede bothe twoo, Agnus leo et Rex And sothefaste kyng, whose Regne is ymmutable; To repentant, by rygour nat vengeable, And ay afforne, in punysshyng of thy lawe, Pees to preferre, or right his swerde may drawe; And to bryng the lost chepe ayene, Oute of deserte vnto his pasture, That was erant, ydyll, and in veyne, O criste Ihesu, of thy benyngne cure, More Redy ay to saven and to cure All that been sore, and scabbede eke with synne, Rather with pyte than with reddour wynne. [[LXX]] Nowe thou that art the verrey rightful lyne, Howe by the name of Ihesus Synners be made rightfull Ca? lxx? XI? All this is crokede, godely to redresse, All maiste of mercy all our myscheves fyne, O criste Ihesu, well of all swettnesse, Lorde of pyte, lord of Rightwysnesse, De misericordia Haue vpon vs this day compassion, That callede is thy Circumcision. And graunt vs grace, withe dew reuerence, This high feste, so noble and so digne, Worship and halowe, devoyde of all offence. And be to vs goodly and benygne, That wer this day merkyde with a signe And the carecte by the laws ordeynede, And of mekenesse, haste it nat dysdeynede. De humilitate And so as thou that neuere dydest trespasse, Through thy mekenesse and lawly subiection, Suffre woldeste, this day of thy grace, For our offence, Circumcision, So kypt from vs all temptacion Of worldly lust, and make the flesshe to serue To the spyryte tyl the body sterue. And graunt vs grace to leve chaste and clene, O criste Ihesu, while that we been here, Þorue preiere of þat heuenly quene That is a mayde and mothir eke in-fere. With helpe of hir, graunt vs this newe yere, So prudently with vertu vs provyde, Our vices all þat we may circumcide. And criste Ihesu, we pray vnto the, Lat thy name, wher we ryde or gone, In eche perell and aduersite, Be our defence ayenst our mortall foon, To make hem stonde still as any stone; And all that cast vs falsely to werry, Make her malice mekely to obeye To thy name, and make hem stonde a-bake, Or thay haue power to haunte her cruell myght. And wikkyd sprytes, so horyble and blake, That besy been to wayte vs day and nyght, Lat thy name dryve hem oute of sight; And in our forhede when we Ihesus enpresse, Make vs of grace her malice to opresse. For to thy name holy we comende Our lyfe, our dethe, body, hert, and all, Our soule also, when we hense wende, O crist Ihesu, o lorde ay Immortall, Prayeng to the when thou vs deme shall, To save all tho fro eternall shame, That haue ful faythe and hole trust in thy name. Book V [[LXXI]] Thow lord, whose light discendyth fro so ferre howe by the prophecys of Balam wacche was made vpon the hyll to asspye the sterre that tolde cristes birthe Ca? lxxj? 12? With-howten whome phebus ne no sterre Thorowe the roundenesse of the speres nyne, Vpon heven power hath to shyne, Let nowe thy light my derkeness enlumyne; That thorough thy helpe I may my style gye Some what to sayne of thy Epiphanye. And lat my breste, benygne lorde, be dewede Doun with some drope fro thy maieste That were this day by a sterre shewede Oute of the Est to worthy kynge? thre, Whiche on the nyght of thy Natyuyte, Gan firste asspye the bright bemes clere Of this sterre on the heven apere— Of whome the spryng was not causell Of fortune ne soden aventure For many a day or this thyng befelle, And many a yere by recorde of scripture, With a-waytyng and wondre bysy cure, In verrey sothe as I Remembre can. A certeyne kynryde towarde the Occian, Whiche of the stok and the lyne cam— Who so lust loke, in bokes fro a ferre— And of the blode of olde Balaam, That som tyme had with his asse werre, The whiche sayde ther shulde ryse a sterre Oute of Iacob and from Israell— Albe ther of no tyme he couthe tell— Vpon whose worde fully in byleve, Ther shulde aryse suche a sterre bright. Worne xij. chose the trouthe for to preve, With-inne mydwynter euer from ny?t to nyght, Whan in aquarye phebus shed his light; For to awayte in all her best wyse Whanne þis sterre on heuene wolde arise. And these xij. wern of the kynrede Of balam, as ?e haue herde me telle, That yere by yere shulde take hede Vpon an hill by-syde a lytell well. And ther in fere a certen space dwelle, A-noynted and bathed and in clothes whight. And of custome thay slepen but a lyte, But in prayer and certeyne ryte? vsede, Thay muste wake and wayte in speciall— And none of hem plattely excusede— Vpon this hill namede Victoriall. And if one dyed, than his sonne shall By statute olde his place ocupye, Or elles one that were next of alye. And this contyneude duryng many yere By custom vsede of antiquyte— As phebus went by meovyng circuler— So thay kept her tyme? by decre, And iche yere wer certeyne dayes thre By calkyng cast and computacion, Sowght and chosen ou?t by good eleccioun For to awayte the vp-rist by the morowe, Of this sterre with his bemes glade, Whiche Balaam sayde sholde avoyde her sorowe. At his vp-riste whose beme? may not fade, To shede his lyght in euery shrowde and shade With-oute wrystyng or drawyng to declyne. Til at the last for the same fine— To see þis sterre moast famous of rennoun On the heven whan it wolde apere— þe worthi kyngis as made is mencioun, Vpon this hill to-gydre gon in fere. For cause thay, who so lust to here, Werne of the stoke of Balaam doun descendyde; Wher-fore of sort the hylle they ben ascendyde, As fell on hem by custome to succede At a certeyne yere by reuolucion. And on this hill estewarde thay toke hede, By gode avyse in her inspeccion, The same nyght of the Incarnacion, Whan criste was borne in Bedlem of marye. The same hour the sterre thay aspye Of newe aryse in the Oryent; Full lustyly of whome the beme? light Gan enlumyne all the firmament. Fro Est to West it yafe so clere a light, That of the stremys euery manere wight Astonyde was thay were so bright and shene, And to the eye so persaunt for to sene. The whiche sterre drewe his cours full right Towarde the hill—liche as boke? tell— Where the kynges the long wynters nyght It to awayte solitarye dwelle. And they anone vpon her knees felle And thanked god with all her hertes luste Which hathe not hem defraudyd of her truste. [[LXXII]] And all the nyght to-gydre as thay woke how iij kynges perceyved the sterre that shewede cristes birthe Ca?lxxij? 13 Vp on this sterre that shoon so fayre and clere; And sodenly vpwarde as they gan loke They sawe a childe above the sterre apere: So yong, so fayre, in a golden spere, Full ryally stonde, and above his hede A large crosse that was of blode all rede. The whiche childe spake to hem a-noon Above the hill withe voyse and chere benyng, And bad hem faste that thay shulde gone Into Iuda right as any lyne, And folowe all-waye the sterre for a signe That shal hem bringe into that regioun; Where as the kynge moost worthi of renooun, Was borne that tyme to haue the Regale Of Iwes lande of verrey dwe right, Whom the sterre dyd specifie, Whan he was borne with his clere light. And thay a-noon whan passed was the nyght, The next morne no lenger lust a-byde But towards hym cast hem for to Ryde. With grete aray and Riall appareyle, As was sittyng to her worthynesse, They shope hem furthe and for thay nolde fayle To do honour to his nobilnesse, With hem they toke golde and great Richesse, To spende and yeve and also for thay ment Withe yefftes grete the childe to present. And furthe thay gone, no lenger wolde thay tarye, Thorow mani a londe and many a diuerse yle, Eueryche of hem on a dromondarye, Whiche weren so swifte that full many a myle Thay passed han with in a lytyll while; That in the space of dayes but xiij??, By condit only of the sterre shene, [[LXXIII]] how the kynges cam to Iherusalem and askyde wher criste was borne Ca?xxiii? 14? Thay entrede ben into Iherusalem, That of Iuda was the cheffe Cyte; Conveyed euere with the bright beame Of the sterre that was so fayre to see. And whan that thay a-mydde the Cyte be, Not astonyed, axede in audience: Ubi est qui natus estWher is the kyng grettest of Reuerence, Rex JudeorumOf Iwes borne for to bere the crowne, Whose sterre we seen in the Orient That from hevyn cast his streme? downe, Which all the worlde vndir the firmament Is gladde to see and we of one entent, Han yftey? brought oute of our contre, Hyme to honour in his ryall see? And whan herode of her comyng knewe, He troubled was and also all the towne, And gan a-noon to chaunge chere and hewe; And made in hast, a convocacion Of all the preste? dwellyng environ; To knowe clerly and be certyfyde, Of the place that was specifiede Of prophetis where crist shal be borne. And thay a-noon the trouthe to hym tolde: In Bedlem, as thay full long afforne Founden oute in her boke? olde, And all the manere to hym thay vnfolde, Fro poynt to poynt, as Mathewe makyth mynde; Redyth his gospell and ther ye shall it fynde [[LXXIIII]] nd then herde gan the kynges calle, howe kyng heroude sent fore the iij kynge? to enquere of cristes birthe Ca? lxxiiij? 15? And of þis mater entretid priueli; Ande curiously how that it was falle, Be-gan enquere and axede bysely. And of the sterre also by and by, He axede hem and in wordes fewe How and in what wyse it gan firste shewe. And whan thay had tolde hym euery dele, Thay departede oute of his presence. But firste he bad hem to enquere well Of the childe with all her diligence. And whan thay hade done hym Reuerence, He chargede hem vndir wordes fayre, Hamwarde by hym algates to repayre, To yeffe hym clerly informacion Of her exployt and of the childe also; Surely affermyng by fals collusion, That he hym-self wold aftir goo Unto the childe and his deuer doo, To worshipp hym—and all vndir colours, The worme abit as serpent vndre floures Daryth full ofte and kepyth hym couertly; Of kynd malice tyll thay a tyme see To shede her venym, and than sodenly, All at ones, when thay vnwarrest be, They styng and hurte and shewe her cruelte, And her venym vnder floures fayre Full ofte is hydde tyll thay may appayre. [[LXXV]] As serpent couereth hym vndir floures to styng and shede his venom whom he may hurt. So fals heroude shewed fals fenyng wordes to haue dissayved thees kynges. Ca? xvj Right so thou serpent of Iniquite, Fals tygre full of doublenesse, Vndir colour of humylite Thy venym darithe and also thy falsenesse! O thou Tyrant! O Rote of cursidnesse! Thou herodis of malice most mortall, What wenst thou hym that knowyth all To disceyve with thy slyghtly wyle, What can sugur vndur galle faine? What wenyst thou the kynge? to be gyle And of malice bryng hem in a trayne? Of whose comyng though þat thou disdeyne, It may not helpe pleynely ne a-vayle, For of thy purpose sothely thou shall fayle. For by grace thay shull in quyete, Maugre thy myght, all thy danger passe; For though that thou with wordes hony swete Maliously vpon her dethe compasse, Thay shall scape dispyte of all thy face, For all the coniecte of thy prynses wyse, As the story shall a-noon dyvyse. And so with venym in his herte loke, He yaffe hem leve passe thorough his Reame In her Repayre hym castyng to be wroke, If thay retourne by Ierusalem. And so þe sterre hem brou?te bedlem, And lyne right the childes hede aboue, Wher as he lay, stille gan to houe. [[LXXVI]] But who the Ioy can tell or endyte Of the Ioya that thees iij kynges had whan thay fovnden criste Ca? xvij? Or with his mouthe, who can the myrthe expresse, Or who can playnly with his penne wryte, The grete blisse or elles the gladnesse Which thay made in verrey sothefastnesse Aftir her iourney and her long waye, Above the house whan thay the sterre sey, Thatte gan to hem clerly certifie Withoute more the childe? dwellyng place? And thay a-noon faste gan hem hye With lusty hert and gladde of chere and face, To worthe doun in a lytyll space. Thay made hem redy and with reverence; Thay entrede in and cam to his presence, Wher as the childe, most worthy of degre, Was with marie in an oxes stalle. And full humbly the kynge? all thre, To-fore the childe on her knes gan falle, And brought her tresour and her yeftys alle As Reuerently as thay can devyse. And hym present in all her best wyse, Lyche her astate?, eueryche aftir othir, Makyng her present with all humylyte, Lyches her age as brothir aftir brothir. Golde, franke and Myrr thay yaffe hym all thre, Offerent Aurum, thus, et mirram Aftir the custome of perce and Calde, For of that lond whanne kyngis present make, The custome is suche yefte? for to take. And this was done with foyson and plente In verrey sothe and grete haboundaunce; For in her present was noo scarcete, For of Riche? they had all suffisauance. Wher-fore thay cast with deuoute obeysaunce Of dewe right with the childe to parte Of her tresour or that thay departe. [[LXXVII]] Howe the offryng these iij kynges shall be vndirstand gostely Ca? xviij And for that golde is payede for tribute, As it is founde of Antiquyte, Ther-fore these kynges for a manere sewte— That thay hem aught of verrey deute— Thay brought hym golde oute of her contre, And yaffe it hym withoutyn Repentaunce, Holy of hert for a reconysaunce. And franke also, as clerke? can devyse, Ordenyde is in conclusion, To God only to make sacryfyce. With contryte hert and deuocion, Therfore to hym for oblacion Thay broughten frank to signyfye thanne, That he was bothe sothefast god and man. Ande for thei wolde in alle thynge obeie To his highnesse with all bysy cure, In token he shulde for mankynde deye, Thay brought hym myrre to his sepulture; For like a man dethe he must endure, And with his blode shed in his passion, Of oure trespas to make redempcioun. In franke also, who þat can discerne, Is vndirstonde the highe maieste Of his power whiche that is eterne; And eke also his high deite. And golde betokenyth his high dygnyte, And myrre declareth vnto us at all Of his manhode that he was mortell. And golde betokenythe of loue the fervence That he to man had of affection. And frank betokenethe the souereygne excellence, In holynesse his conuersacion. And myrre betokenethe the tribulacion That he suffrede and all the grete penaunce, For vs in erthe by contynuaunce. In golde he was knowen as a kyng, In frank a prest, who so can take hede, Of myrre also this day the offryng Was longyng only to his manhede. And thus he was withoutyn any drede, Bothe kyng and prest as I discerne can, And for our sake in erthe a mortall man. In golde also, metall most gloryouse, Fygured was his high deite; In franke also—that is so preciouse— The soule of criste most perfyte of degre; And Myrre betokeneth thurugh his dignyte, His flesshe the whiche by disposicion, May neuere suffre noo corrupcion. And of these yefte? passyng Reuerent, Full of mysterrye and hevenly privete, Whan thay had made her presente Vnto the childe ay sittyng on her knee, With grete avyse thay gan be-holde and se— To fore that thay Remevyde fro that place— His godely chere and his fayre face. Considryng his feturs by and by, With grete insight and humble entencion, And ay the more thay loke bysyly, The more thay ioyen in her inspection; And thought all, as in her reason, Though kynde and god had sette in ?o? fygure, The beaute holy of euery creature. It myght not in sothenesse haue be liche To his fayrnesse nor peregall, For he that is above nature ryche Hath made this childe fayrest in speciall. For in his face they byholden all The hole beaute and fayrnesse eke also, Of hevyn and erthe to-gydre bothe twoo. Wherefore no wondre though thay hem delyte Most passyngly vpon hym to see, For thay in hert reyoisen hem not a lyte On hym to loke that thay haue liberte, For ay the more playnely that thay be In his presence, the parfyte hote fyre Of hertly Ioye hem brent by desyre. And of ?o? thyngh full gode hede thay toke: How that the chylde demurely cast his sight Tawardes hem and godely gan to loke On her face? with his eyne bryght; And how that he put his Arme? right Godely to hem makyng a manere signe To hem of thankyng, with chere full benigne. And of his mothir thay muche thyng enquere, Touchyng his birthe with humble affeccion; And she ansewerde, moste femynyne of chere, Full prudently to euery question With chere demure and loke ycaste adoune, With all the porte of womanly clennesse, Hir-self demenyng and chefly with mekenesse. [[LXXVIII]] Of vertuose pouerte and mekenesse of our lady Ca? lxxiiii? 19? O she that was of hevyn and erthe quene, And of hell, lady and eke pryncesse, O what was he, alas, that may susteyne To be proude considryng her mekenesse! O pryde, alas, o Rote of our distresse! Though thy boste above the skyes blowe Nota bene notaThy bildyng high shall be brought full lowe! O thou suquydre, alas, whi nylt thou see Howe she that hathe hevyn in hir demayne, And souerayne lady is bothe of londe and see, And of the axtre by-twene the pole? tweyne And all the enbrasyng of the golden cheyne, Yet vnto god, I say in sothefastnesse, Above all this agrede her mekenesse. O pompe elate, with thy chere? bolde, Nota bene nota Remembre and see and loke how that she— On whom kynge? haue yoye to by-holde— In her presence to knelen on her knee, Though she of wemen be highest in degre, Take hede and see how lowly in a stable Howe that she satte this lady worshipable. Wer ther of golde any clothe? founde, Nota bene nota Of silke damaske or ryche tarteryne? Or was ther arras a-bou?te hir head vp boonde, Or was ther any veluet Crymesyne, Or was ther any samyte or satyne Or wer ther any tappyte? large or wyde. The nakyd grounde to keuer or to hide?

Or of hir bede was the appareyll Nota bene nota Of golde or sylke curteynede large a-boute, Or were ther shete? of longe or wyde entayle Kyt oute of Reynes nay with-outynn doute? Or were there any lade? for to loute To hir highnesse with bysy obseruance, Or of maydens any attendaunce? Nota bene notaO as me semythe, of verrey dewe right, Ye wemen all shulden take hede— With your perle? and your stone? bright— How that your quene, floure of womanhede, Of no devyse enbroyded hath her wede, Ne furrede withe Ermyne ne with tresty graye, Nota bene notaNe martren ne sable, I trowe in gode faye, Was noon founden in her garment, And yet she was the fayrest for to see That euere was vndir the firmament. Wherfore, me semyth, ye shulde haue pyte To se a lady of so high degre, So semely atyrede, o ye wemen all. Be-holde howe narowe closede in an oxe stalle. Late be your pryde and your affeccion Of riche aray, and nothyng yov delite In worldely pompe and suche abusion Of sundri clothis, reede, bleke and white. And be well ware, or the spere byte Of cruell dethe and the fell smerte. Nota bene notaMy councell is to lyfth vp yowre hert To that lady and to that worthy quene, Þat ?ou may beest helpe in ?our nede, And yov releve in euery woo and tene, And delyuere from all myscheve and drede. And þinkeþ pleynly and takyth ri?t good hede, Þat al schal passe, aray and eke richesse, When ye lest wene and all your semblynesse. Lat hem affore be to yov a kalendere: Nota bene nota Isoude, Elyn, and eke polixene, Hester also and dydo with her chere, And Riche Candace, of ethyope quene,— Ligge þei not graue vndre clowris grene? And yet all this may not your pryde atame, Nought withestondyng þat ye shall do the same. Eke after dethe a-bydyth no memorye, Nota bene nota For ay with dethe comyth for-yetylnesse; And fare well than arey and all veyneglorye, Saue only vertu that stant in sikernesse. I take recorde of the high mekenesse Of hir that is of holynesse welle, Of whome I thynke sothely for to telle, How that she satte, for all hir worthynesse, Nota bene nota Holdyng hir childe full lowly on the grounde; And kynge? knelyng, as ye haue herde expresse, Be-holdyng hir in vertu most habounde, Til at þe laste þey haue a leyser founde To take her leve, and the same day Thay gon to Ryde homwarde on her waye. [[LXXIX]] And sewyng aftir on the next nyght, howe the Angell warnede the iij kynge? not to passe by heroude but by an othir way Ca? lxxix? 20? While thay slepte at her logyng place, Came an Angell, a-peryng with grete light, And warnede hem that thay ne trace By herode?, but bade þat thay shulde pace Withe-oute a-bood, in all the haste thay may To her kyngedom by another way. And in shorte tyme, to her Region Thay ben repayrede, the gospell tellyth vs. And of her name?, to make mencion, The first in Ebrwe was callede Appellius; Appellius Amerus Damathus Galgalath Sarachim The next Amerus, the thryde Damathus; And in greke, the first Galgatha, And Serachym, the thryde Malgalatha. And in latyn, as boke? maken mynde, Malgalatha Iasper Balta?er Melchiore The first of hem named was Iasper; And the secounde, playnely as I fynde, Lyche myne Auctour reherse? as I dar, Called was and namede Balthasar; And the thryde—ye gete of me no more— As I Rede was callede Melchiore. Of whose repayre, as some boke? sayne, That first of all thay wente to the see, And retournede to her kyngdome agayne. Thay shippede hem at Tharce the Cyte, For whiche heroude, of cursede cruelte. In spiritu vehementi conterens naves TarsisIn Tharce made all the shippe? brenne, Wher-of wrytheth Dauid, the sauter if ye kenne. And vnto yov clerly to specifie, Towchynge this fest and this solempnite, Wherof is sayde this worde Epyphanye, Whiche is a worde of grete Auctoryte; And sayde and componede, who so can se, Of Epi firste, and phanos, sothe to sayne. And of o worde combynede of these twayne, Comyth this worde of Epyphanye. And this word Epi, by descripcion Is sayde of heght, as I can signyfie; And of a shewyng by demonstracion Is phanos sayde; and so by gode reason, Epi and phanos, bothe knyt in fere, Is a shewyng that dothe a-lofte pere. And for this day, a-lofte was the sterre Which criste? birthe and Incarnacion With his streme? gan shewe fro so ferre, Fro Est to West in many a Region. Wherfore this fest, in conclusion, As ye to-forne haue herde me specifye, This fest is callede of Epiphanye. The wheche feste haith a prerogatif Of myracle? notable in speciall, For thynges foure wrought in cristes lyfe Wern on this day by his power Riall. The first of all most memoryall Is of the kynge?, as ye haue herde me sayne Whiche were in ydelle to Reherse agayne. The secounde is, as it is sothely tolde, .ij. That criste Ihesu, this day of saint Iohn, The yere whan he was xxx?? wynter olde, Baptisede was in the flume Iourdan. At whiche tyme, thre kynge? vnder one, Discendeth this day worthy of memorye. The firste was that from the high glorye, .i. The faders voyce, as clerke? lust endyte, Came dovne to erthe that men myght here; And like a dove with fayre feders white, The holy gost also dyd a-pere; And criste Ihesu, the faders son entere .ij. This day aperyng in our mortall kynde, Was of saint Iohn Bapti?ede, as I fynde. .iij. And for as moche as thay all thre This day were sene by sothefaste apparence— Thay beyng one in perfyte vnyte— Therfore, this day of moste Reuerence, Named is truly in sentence, Theophanos, for god in trible wyse Ther in aperyd, as yo haue herde devyse. For theos is as moche for to mene As god in englisshe, yf ye lust to se; Phanos a shewyng withouten any wene, As ye haue herde aforne rehersed of me; And for in erthe, o god in Trynyte, This day aperede withouten any lye, Ye truly may calle it theophane. Eke whan crist was passede xxx?? yere, This day he turnede water in to wyne That passyngly was to the eye clere And of tarage inly gode and fyne, The whiche he sent to Archideclyne. And for this myracle Inly vertuouse, In Galele was shewed in a house. This same day whiche men dyd espye— As holy chirche maketh mencion— Therfore it is namede Bethphanye. For Bethe in Inglisshe by discripcion Is callede an house or a mancion. Of whiche myracle, renomed of fame, Bethphanye this day hathe the name. Eke in the yere of his passion, Fer in desert this day also, I rede, With loves fyve, thorough his grete foyson, Fyve thousande I fynd that he dyde fede. Of whiche myracle, yf ye take hede, This day is last namede phagyphanye, Lyke as it firste was clepid Epiphanye. For this worde phagi vnto our entent Is sayde of fedyng or refeccion; For whiche myracle passyng excellent, That is so famous and of so high renoun— Like as the gospell maketh mencion— Þerfore þis dai amonge þe oþyr alle, Ye Iustely maye phagyphanye it call. [[LXXX]] A notable declaracion of these iij gyfte? of the iij kynges Ca? Nowe criste Ihesu, this day this high feste, We the beseche with hert, will and thought, Only of mercy to here our Requeste: For the myracles that thou therin hast wrought, For loue of hem that the so ferre hau sought, The worthy kynge? that came oute of Calde The for to honour in Bedlem the Cetye. And thourgh prayer of these kynge? thre, That for thy loue token her viage, Ihesu defende vs fro all aduersite; And make vs stronge and sure in our passage In this exile and parlous pylgrymage, Whiche our fomen of malice and of pryde Hath in this lyfe by-sett vs on euerysyde. The whiche our golde of perfyte charite Nota bene nota Wolde vs by-Ryve by persecucion, That we shulde offre of fervence vnto the Of hertly loue and high deuocion. And eke our franke of contemplacion, Wher-with we shulde make our sacryfyce Of high disdeyne and malice they dispyce. For golde of trouthe is falsely nowe alayede By feyned loue and Symylacioun, Nota bene nota And fayth with fraude is corrupte and affrayed With double tunges and detraccioun; Our franke also of high perfection That shulde brenne clere above the skye, Is with the Coode medelede of envye. That it alas yeve may no light In the sensure of trwe affeccion; Nota bene nota For day of trouthe is turnede vnto nyght Thorough wrong reporte and false suspecion. And þus good feith is rollid up soo doun, And trwe menyng darkyd with a skye That we in Englisshe calle flaterye. And thus our offryng gothe all moste all wronge, Nota bene nota Of gold and franke for ought I can aspye And our myrre hathe be byhynde longe. Vs to preserue from all suche trecherye, For nowe is turnede to ypocrysye Our holynesse, and that is grete routhe, And cause whie, for fraude hathe banysshede trouthe. Nota bene nota But crist Ihesu, that all this maist amende, And that is mysse in eche estate redresse, This hie fest suche grace to vs sende, That we the golde of faythe and stablonesse And eke the franke of perfyte holynesse, May on this day present vnto the Withe all trwe hert as dyd the kynges thre. Nota bene notaAnd graunt also, bothe to high and lowe, To haue suche myrre in her aduertence, That euery wight his owne faute? knowe, And that no man be hasty of sentence To deme lightly byfore or in absence; For sodem dom meynt with ignoraunce, Hathe a long tayle sewyng of repentaunce. Nota bene notaFor in sothenesse, if that euery man Wolde make amyrrour of his awne mynde, To deme hym-selffe of thyng that he well can, And open his yen that hau be longe blynde To se his faute? that he shulde well fynde, I trow in soithe, for any haste or rape, Harmele? fro dome his felowe shulde ascape. [[LXXXI]] Howe we shulde pray to god to do this offryng gostely. Ca? lxxxj? 22? Nowe crist Ihesu—that knowest euery herte And no thyng may be hyd fro thy presence, Ne fro thyn eye declyne ne asterte— Graunt vs this day of thy magnyfycence The golde of loue, the franke of Innocence, And the chast myrre of clene entencion, So to presente in our oblacion To thyne highnesse þat it be acceptable; While þat we lyue eure from ?eere to ?eere, As was the offryng in Bedlem in a stable, Made vnto the and to thy mothir dere Of the kynges, that with the stremes clere Of a sterre conveyde were by grace, Wher thou lay to come to the place. And vnto the this day we clepe and call— Þou blissful quene of kingis emperesse, That yaf thy sonne, soukyng in a stalle, That chast mylke of virgynall clennesse— That thou this fest, o sterre of holynesse, Conueye oure offringe to þat sterri see Wher next thy son thou hast the souereynte. And gode lady in this sorowefull vale Of trouble and wo and of hevynesse— Sithe thou of Iacob art the right scale, The weye of lyffe the ledder of holynesse— Towarde that courte the evyn way vs dresse, And make thy men thedir to assende Wher euere is blisse, and Ioye hath non ende. For certe? lady, in this lyfe we lakke Of sothefast yoye, all the suffysaunce Save amonge we knele afore the Rakke: Where with thy sonne was some tyme thy pleasaunce, And vs reyoysyng, as by Remembraunce, Only by lykenesse to loke on thyne ymage And on thy sonne with his fayre visage. But, o, alas, ther is but a lykenesse Of portrature that dothe vs grete offence, For we may not haue full the blissednesse Of thy vysage ne of thy presence; And so to vs grete harme dothe aparence, Whan that we sene of our desyre we fayle, We may well pleyne but it may not avayle. Yet day by day of trwe affection, We gon of newe thy likenesse for to see, Wher-of o thyng we haue compassion: To see þe beestis þat so humble be To stonde my atwene thy sonne and the, The rude Asse and the oxe also. And then we sayne, compleynying in our woo, With all our hert: o what thyng may this be, Nota bene nota To se that lorde in a Rakke lye That hath the hevyn vndir his powste, And all this worlde power hath to gye! O how it is that the Regalye Of heven and erthe is brought dovne so lowe That noman luste vnethes his power knowe! And sodenly our herte? gynnythe colde, Sore a-stonyed and is for woo ni? mate, So grete a quene whan that we be-holde Alone syttyng all disconsolate So fayre, so gode, and of so hygh estate, Most womanly and benygne of chere, Thy sonne and thou, to-gydre bothe in fere, In the bounde? of so narowe a dongeon, Wher-of all erthe tremble sholde and quake, And euery wight by lamentacion Wepe and pleyne, sighe and sorowe make; O blisfull quene, only for thy sake, To see on the none other awaytyng, But beste? rude with hay hem-selffe fedyng. But in o thyng comforte yet we fele, O goode lady sothely while we see, Thre worthy kynge? a-fore thy face knele, Bryngyng her yefte? with all humylyte And hem gouerne like to thy degre, With meke attendaunce and full besy cure;— But all this thyng we se but in picture. Alas the while and yet it dothe vs ease, And in partye aswagethe our grevaunce, For no thyng may our sorowe so appese As euer of the to haue a remembraunce. For in the is our hole suffisaunce, And though we leve in langour for absence, Yet gode lady for thy magnyficence, To thy servaunte?, of thy grace nowe see, And to thy sonne, be for vs a mene. This high feste, which longyth vnto the— In whiche thou were honourede like a quene With myrre and frank and golde that shone so shene— Nowe for the honoure this day was to the, And for the loue of the kynge? thre, Whan we shall parte oute of this woofull lyffe And make an ende of this captivyte Of herode? thourght his mortall stryffe, The fende betrappe vs thurgh his cruelte; That tyme lady of thy benygnyte, A-yentse the snares of this dredfull werre, To lyfe eterne be thou our lode sterre. Book VI [[LXXXII]] Glorye and pryes, laude and high honour, Howe our lady was puryfiede. Ca? lxxxij? 22 O blisfull quene, be yeve vnto the That were of god the cheve chaste toure, Surely foundede vpon humylyte, Schitte with þe keie of clene virginite; Fro all synne fully to be assurede, Of the holy goste rounde aboute ymurede. That neuere brennyng of no flesshely hete Asayle myght thyn holy tabernacle, Withe dewe of grace thy closet was so swete, Fulfilled with vertu oonly by myracle. God chese thy wombe for this habitacle And halowede it so clene in euery coste, To make it sacrary for his awne goste. Not withstonding þat þou were so clene Above all othir by election, Of mekenesse oonly, oo thu heuenely quene, Thou list to haue non indignacioun. The dayes passede of thy purgacion To fulfille the precept of the lawe In euery thyng and not o poynt with drawe. But euer lyke, as it is specifiede, Leuitici, who so can vndirstonde, To the temple to be puryfyede Thou mekely came thyn offryng in thyne hande, Al-be þe lawe sette on þee no bonde. For it is there makede mencion, Touchyng the lawe of purgacion, If a woman conceyve by a man And haue a childe by medelyng hem betwene, Þat be a male, þe lawe techith þan Fourty dayes that she shulde be vnclene, And kepe her close that no man shulde hir seen; And aftir that she sholde hir offryng, In lawe expressed, to the temple brynge. But taketh hede, in conclusion, How this lawe like, as ye shall fynde, Ne was not put but by condicion Only to hem that corrupt wer by kynde, Thorugh touche of man, of suche it made mynde. The days noumbrede of her purgacion, To come and make her oblacion And bryng a lamb, the whiche in sacrifice Shulde all be brent in the holy place; And a pygeon, as lawe dothe devyse, She shuld eke offre as for her trespase. And all fylthe fro hir to enchace, She of the prest, halowede and sanctifiede, Returned hom al fulli purified. And if she had in her possession Redely no lambe only for pouerte, Then shulde she take for her oblacion Two turtle doves and ther-with-all go fre; Or two pegyons, like as ye may se, Levitici, wher by distynccion, Of þis offringe is made discripcion. But this mayde, who so can take hede, Excludet was for condicion That bare her childe withoute manys seede,— Beyng euere clene from all corrupcion— Wher thorugh, she was fro suche oblacion By lawe exempt, and was vnder no charge For hir clennes stondyng at hir large. For of her wombe, the cloyster virgynall, Was euere liche, bothe firste and laste, Closed and shette as castell principall; For the holy goste devysede it and cast And at bothe tymes shet iliche faste,— In hir childyng no more thorugh grace broke At hir conceyvyng than it was vnloke. For nature withoutyn any stryfe, Of Repuugnaunce or any recistence, Yaffe this mayde a speciall prerogatyffe: As mother parede to haue experience Only of childyng and fele non offence, Neyther of sekenesse ner of suche manere woo In traveylyng as othir wymen doo. She was exempt from all suche passion For hir clennes and so was noon but she, And yet her tyme of puryficacion Sche dide a-byde of hir humilite. And like as lawe ordeynyth by decre, Aftir all this, of custome as she aught, To the temple she hir offryng brought, To yeffe ensample only of mekenesse, To þe lawe sche mekely wolde obeye Fro poynt to poynt—the gospell saythe expresse— And on noo syde wold it not with-seye. And þou? þat sche bar of golde no keye, To by a lambe for pouert constreynyng, Yet she full mekely to make hir offryng Brought two turtle?—as it is sayde afforne— That was the offryng of pore folke ichone, Whiche to the temple whan that she hath borne, As custome was, she offrede hem a-noon. And aftir that olde Symeon, With humble herte and full bysy payne, The childe enbrasyng in his Arme? twayne, [[LXXXIII]] Howe Symeon receyved criste of our lady in the Temple Ca? xxiij? Of hir modur goodly gan him take. Of lovyng hert and grete deuocion, And suche a ioye of hym gan to make Withe-in hym-self of high affection, That he ne couthe, neythir by worde ne soun, Oute warde declare, neythir with chere ne face, The passyng Ioye that gan his hert enbrace. And he was rightfull holy and vertuouse, This olde man, this blissede Symeon, Dredeful also and passyngly famous Amonge the preeste? to Recken hem euerychone That was expectant of full long a-goon, On the comfort and consolacion Of Iserael in his entencion For he had ansewer of the holy goste In his prayer that he shulde see, The byrthe of cryste that is of power moste And eke fro deeth þat he schal goo free To the tyme of his Natyvyte;— And to the day that with his eyne olde, The birthe of hym that he may be-holde— The whiche day is by grace come. And for þat he bi reuelacioun The tyme knewe, he hath the waye nome To the temple with hygh deuocion, To se of criste the presentacion; Howe that Marye and Ioseph eke also, The childe presente and her offerynge do. And for that criste was the first born, Afftir the lawe in his tendre age— Not of levi as ye haue herde to forn, But of Iuda comyng by lynage— Therfore his mothir, most holy of visage, Hir offringe made list not for to striue, For hym ayeyne to pay shillynges fyfe— Liche as the custome of the lawe was— She mekely made his redempcion. And Symeon, beholdyng all this case Full stilly in his inspeccion, For love brennyng be affeccion, Of verrey hert sodenly abrayede, Holdyng the childe evyn thus he sayde: [[LXXXIIII]] O blisfull lorde, of thy high grace Howe where and whan Symeon made Nunc dimittis ca? xxiiij? If that thou lust now thou maiste me lete Oute of this life in pees and rest pace; Nunc dimittis servum tuum domine, etc. And suffre me to dey in quyete. For nowe to me dethe is wondir swete; Quia viderunt oculi mei salutare, etc. Nowe haue I seen thy helthe and thy socour,— And of mankynde lorde and savyour— Quod parasti ante faciem, etc. Whiche thou hast dight affore the face? all, Lumen ad reuelacionem etc. Of yche peple to make hem glad and light— To lete thy grace so to erthe falle, Thorugh all the worlde to shewe his beme? bryght, That may be callede for comforte of his light,— Of foreyne folke the reuelacion, The glorye also and the savacion Of Israel thy peple in speciall, To voyde hem oute of all derkenesse. And Marye full mekely listenyth all, And gan merveyle with grete avysenesse Of the wordes that he gan expresse; And Iosephe eke gan to wondir also. And Symeon hem blessynge bothe two, Spake to Marye and seyde in audience: Et benedixit illis Symeon Ecce positus est hic In Ruinam et resurrectionem Et tuam ipsius animam pertransibit gladius By-holde and se in thyn inspection, How he is put in ruyne and offence Of many one here in his region; And to some in resurexion That shall releve, thorugh his myghty grace. And thorugh thy sawle shall a sharpe swerde pace, Of hertely woo to as his passion— That passyngly shall bitter be and fell— To opyn herte? by confession Her synfull thoughte? opynly to tell. And Anna than, the doughter of phanuell,— Born of the trybe and of the kynrede Called Aser, sothely as I rede, [[LXXXV]] Of the Ioye that Anna the doughter of Phanuel made whan crist was offrede in to the Temple ca? xxv? That was that day Ronne fer in age,— Whiche in the temple by contynuaunce, Sole by her self oute of maryage, Lay ni?t and day in fastynge and penaunce, In wyddowe abyte sad of contenaunce. And in prayer was hir bysy cure, Which in that hour of grace or aventure,— Whan criste was ther with his mother dere In the tyme of his oblacioun— This Anna cam, demure and sad of chere, And vnto hym with grete deuocion, Whan she hym sawe, fel on knees doun, Recomfortede of all her olde smerte, Hym honouryng with all hir hole herte. Sayde opynly that all myghten here; Bethe myrry and light in your entencion, And euery man be glad and of goode chere, For nowe is borne for our savacion, He that shall make our Redempcion. This yonge childe, blissed mot he be, That me hathe grauntede his face for to se. And then in sothe whan euery thyng was doun Aftir the lawe withouten excepcion, And that Anna and holy Symeon Had of this childe made declaracion— As ye haue herde in conclusion— The childe and Ioseph and this mayde free, Retournede home into galelee. [[LXXXVI]] Nowe as me semythe in this high ferre A profitable declaracion of the propretees of the Turtle Ca? xxvj? That named is the puryficacioun, Euery man aught to be myrry; And withe gode hert and hole entencion, Deuoutely bryng his oblacion. And offre a turtil, firste of Innocence, And a dove next for his offence; For grete mysterye is in bothe tweyne: The tone commendyde for his chastite, Nota bene nota And that othir, if I shall not feyne, Is symple and meke withoute cruelte; The turtle prysede of trouthe and honeste, And the dove hathe kyndely excellence Of mekenesse and hertely pacience. And who that wol his offryng make a-right, Nota bene nota He may not fayle noon of bothe twoo: Fyrste shyne in clennes with his chaste light As the Turtle, and ther with also, Liche the dove, bothe in wele and woo, His hert daunt so by a-temperaunce To voyde rancour and plant in sufferaunce. And as the Turtle by contemplatyffe For synne soroweth with waymentyng,— Only for loue of thilke eternall lyfe That lastythe aye and may haue no endyng— And as the birde sheweth the commyng Of grene ver with fresshe budde? newe, Ryght so of vertu with floures fayre of hewe. He muste ensample of the Turtle take, And be well ware that he not varye But life sool whan he hathe lost his make; And in prayer be also solytarye, And loke all waye that he not ne tarye On noo caren of no flesshely hede. And withe all this to take also hede, That he his lyfe lede not in veyne, But like a dove, bysely espye Where he of vertu gedre may the greyne; And þat he fle not oute of companye— Wantynge also the galle of enuye— And that he haue ay indignacion Of synfull luste full of corrupcion, On eny caryne to fostre hym or fede. And euermore with all his besy payne, Eschewyng, synne, loue god and drede; And with the dove sighen and compleyne For his offence, and with wynges tweyne, Take his flight as fer-furthe as he can, Thorugh perfyte loue bothe to god and man. And as the dove touchithe eke her make Nota bene notaOnly with kyssyng whan thay to-gydre gone, So muste he, wheþer he slepe or wake, Thorughe charyte set his hert in one; And like a dove, make his nest of stone. This is to say, among all his pleasaunce He muste his flesshe daunte with penaunce. Nota bene notaAnd as a dove with hir eyne meke,— Of kynde espyeth a-myddes the Ryuere Occuli eius caput columbe super Riuos aquarumThe haukes shadowe when he dothe her seke, And flieth away or he come eny nere— Right so must he, with perfyte eyne clere, A-myd the waters full of woo and stryfe, In the wawes of this mortall lyfe Nota bene notaThe dedely shade of the fynde eschewe— That waytyth hym with snares large and huge And to þe deeth euere doith him purswe To trappe hym here in this deluge— And like a dove fle to his refuge, By grace only if he may escape, Or dethe be-tray hym with his soden Rape. And who by clennesse with the Turtle fleethe— As I to forne haue made mencion— Nota bene nota And like the dove, affore his parell seeth, Of dethe to eschewe the persecucion, And can he meke in tribulacion, I dar Recorde and wryte it for a sothe, Truly to god he is offryng dothe. But who that euere lyfe in chastite And hathe envye enclosede in his thought, He mai wel offre, what so þat he be, To god a turtle but the dove nought. Wherfore, they muste be to-gdyre brought, That clennesse by sothefaste vnyte Withoutyn partyng be knytte with charyte. And sothely thanne, ther is no more to seyne, Whan his offryng and oblacion Is iustely made to god of bothe tweyne, It is acceptede of more deuocion. And for to make a shorte discripcion Of the Turtle and the dove? kynde, Reed here these verses and ye shall it fynde: Alta petit Turtur cantando gemit veniens ver Nunciat et caste viuit solusque moratur Pullos nocte fouet morticinium quoque fugit Grana legat volitat sociata cadaucra vitat Felle caret plangit socium que per oscula tangit Petra dat huic nidum fugit hostem in flumine visum Rostro non ledit geminos pullos bene nutrit. This fest also—bothe of more and lesse Thorugh oute the worlde in euery Region— Called is the fest of candilmasse. For sondrye skylles in conclusion— As olde boke? maken mencion— And howe that firste this feste toke his name, So as I can to yov I will atame. [[LXXVII]] How Candilmas firste toke the name Ca? xxvij? Some tyme, when Rome thorough his high Renoun, Was most flouryng in power and in myght, Euery fifte ?eere bi reuolucyoun, In februarie vpon the first nyght, Eche man and childe with a tapre light, Went in the Cyte tweyne and tweyne a paas Vn to a temple whiche þat sacrid was To februa of olde fundacion— Þat modir was to mars omnipotent— In whose honoure this procession Ordenede was by greate avysement. Nota quid lustrumAt eche lustre wenyng in her entent, That hir power and greate worthynesse Preferryde was, thorough helpe of this godesse, From all assaute of euery aduersarie— Supposyng fully in her opynyon, That she fortune made debonayre For to susteyne the honour of her towne, And thorough her helpe and mediacion, That myghty mars to encrece her glorye, In all conquest yeff to hem victorye. For whiche cause thorugh oute the Cyte, As ye haue harde of high and lowe estate, Was first ordeynede this solempnyte In the Temple that was consecrate To februa, the goddesse fortunate, Thorough helpe of whome they wer victoryous. And so this custume supersticious, In Rome twone, as myn auctour seythe, Observede was long and many a day. Yet aftir that they turnede to the faythe, But euere in one this Ryte thay kept alway— For olde custome is harde to putte away, And vsage grevythe folke? full sore To do a-way that thei haue kepte of yore. But at the laste Pope Sergius, Of the peple seyng this erroure, And that the custome was full perilous, Dyd his devour and also his laboure, This ryte to chaunge into the honoure Of our lady, so that this high feste, Fro the highest doun to the leste, Euery man and woman in her honde To the Temple shulde a tapre bryng, Þoru? out þe worlde in euery manere londe; And ther with all make her offryng, Aftir the gospell the preste? hand kyssyng,— With light solempne that all myghten sene,— In honour oonly of þe heuenly quene That best may be our mediatrice To hir son that is with-oute fayle, Bothe lorde and kyng, and she Emperatrice Of londe, of see, of pees and of batayle, Withouten whome no conquest may avayle, For she hath power more in sothefastnesse, Then februa of Rome the goddesse. And thus this ryte was vtterly Refusede By Sergius, as ye haue herde devyse,— That was afforne of hem of Rome vsede Full many a day in her paynym wyse Whom to sue al oristen must dispise— And of candeles whan this ryte gan passe, Came the name first of Candelmasse. This feste also of full long a-gone, The name toke of the procession— Made of Anna and holy Symeon, When thay hym mette with grete deuocion, Brought to the Temple to his oblacion As was the lawe custom and vsaunnce Of holy chirche for a remembraunce— Observede furthe yet fro yere to yere Of februarye on the first day, Withe sacrede light vpon tapers clere— Shynyng as bright as phebus dothe in may— Whan the peple in what thay can or may, Full Redy ben of on entencion To make in fygure a presentacion Of criste Ihesu with all her full myght, Syngnyfyede, who so can take hede, Withe the tapre that we offre light: For firste the wax betokenyth his manhede, The weyke his soule, the fyre his godhede; And as the wax is made and wrought of newe,— Thorough small bees of floures fresshe of hewe, Thorughe clennesse only and diligent labour Of blossomes gedrede and to the hyve brought— So cristes manhode grewe oute of a floure, Whose fresshe beaute of cloure fadyth nought; For of a mayde clene in will and thought— Like as wax of floures soote and glade Is tried out and doith hem not to fade— So criste Ihesu, conservyng her clennesse, His manhode toke a mayden free, She standyng hole flouryng in fayrenesse Withe all the fresshenesse of virgynyte. And as a tapre is one to gyder and three, So thilke lorde, that is bothe thre and one, Toke flesshe and blode to save vs euerycheone, Of a mayde whiche this day fro Bedlem, Mekely went to be puryfyede To the temple in Iherusalem,— As here-to-forne it is specifiede,— In whose honoure this feste is magnyfyede Of all cristen with fresshe tapers shene, To signyfye, who that will be clene, Moste offre a tapre to-gyder made of thre: Faythe and werke and trwe entencion; For sothefastely but thay coniunede be With-oute partyng or dyvysion, Neythir his offryng ne oblacion— How fayre outewarde playnely that it seme— To god above it may neuere cueme. For þou? his tapre brene bri?te as day And environ make his light to shede, If werke fro faythe proloynede be away And trwe entent folowe not the dede, Fare well his gwerdon, his meryte and his mede, For whan these thre be not knytte in one He is not able to offryng for to gone. For if these thre to-gyder be not meynt— Feith, werke and hool entencioun— His offryng farythe but as a tapre queynt That yefethe no light ne bryghtnesse envyron, Full derke and dede fro all deuocion. His offryng is but if these ilke thre Ben knytte in one thorough perfyte vnyte. Now criste that art the sothefast holy light, The hert of man graciously enlumyne; Vpon vs wrecches, fro thy see so bryght, So lat the sonne of thy mercy shyne For loue of hir that is a pure virgyne— Whiche on this day to the temple went Of mekenesse onely the for to present— Thorough whose prayer, lorde of thy grete myght, Graunt vs grace in thy high holde Whan we deye to holde our tapre? light To-for thy see—where as it is tolde, Seuene chaundeleris alle of pure golde, Fresshely with light stand affore thy face— Thyder to come of mercy graunt vs grace. And in this exile, where as we soiourne, Graunt vs lorde while that we ben here In februarye—as phebus dothe retourne The circuyt of his golden spere— Vpon this day, ay fro yere to yere, With tapres fresshe and bryght torches shene To kepe and halowe in honour of that quene, To whome this feste is in speciall Dedicate, bothe of more and lesse— Whiche bare hir childe in a lityll stall Bitwene an ox and a sely asse. And blissede quene, this fest of Candelmasse, To thy seruante? shelde and socoure be, To kepe and save from all aduersyte. Amen.</field>
