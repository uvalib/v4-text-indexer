      <field name="fulltext">ASHAMED When the clock of my heart runs down, refusing To tick in a case too old for using, If I live new life, and, for good behaviour, Am allowed to speak to my Lord and Saviour, I shall beg His pardon with humble boldness For the folly of love-resisting coldness And the shame of a tongue that, loose and careless, Pattered a prayer, which was almost prayerless. THE GOD Graybeard, annotating Love, What is all this cold blaspheming? Love is known to change to scorn Between an evening and a morn. Men have been stricken dead For less than you have said. Lust, the cunning parasite, Breaks the oath he's fond of swearing; Quarter-Love and Half-Love play Forgetful of a yesterday; But Love—the god—is strange To aught of central change. Scholarly barbarian, While you spill your drops of acid, Love recalls with what a bliss You stirred him when he ran to kiss The child too little then To wound him with a pen. Stars of melted radiance learn How to fade from fire to darkness; Steady for a million years, The mountains dance like barley-ears; But Love was born to brave Both Passion and the Grave. TESTIMONY Yes. Close beside that double-may. Behold The rounded length of newly-fretted mould. Beneath it, as in calm obedience, lies One of the loveliest daughters of Surprise. To know her was to hear the heart engage To purge itself of what had come by rage Or prompting such as needs an evil hour To sicken Conscience with a poisonous flower. She drew toward her by a holy thread The shrunken soul, the long-discomfited, And bent her body hastily to share The rugged cross a friend was told to bear. Her village was a sky, and she a sun That did not set because the day was done. Never to be forgotten, she is part Of every household, every stricken heart; And when a gate shall creak, the hand not seen, Starved love will watch the doorway that has been The frame of Tenderness. No longer here Those lips and eyes shall bid the voice of Fear Become a whisper (for, when she was still A breathing presence of the Heavenly Will, She gave in heartfuls of the virtue lent To her by Him, the Star of Testament), But, radiant in a new discipleship, Elsewhere she hands a cup for Pain to sip; Elsewhere, as once with us, she lamps the gloom, Binds up a grief, and helps a home to bloom. IT SHALL COME TO PASS Having worked in the Vineyard till evening and liberty came, Having heard His encouraging voice and acknowledged His pence, I am free from the care of the vines, and I turn to the flame Of the sun, who is resting his chin on a far-away fence In the western division of sky. If these shovel-worn hands Are a signal of duty well done; if the grit on my brow Is a proof of my vigorous service on hearing commands, I may square my obedient shoulders, relaxing the vow, And may drop, as a cone, in the bracken, and wonder my fill In the dominant huddle of pines on the crest of the hill. While the years, with their sane intermingling of acid and sweet, Are at work on my soul, as my hands daily work on the vines In the vineyard controlled by the pulses that steadfastly beat For the sake of the juice in the clusters, the pith of the pines, It were strange if the spirit they model should be as a flint On the patch of a road, never seeking to question the Source, Never flaming and aching—yes, dying!—to capture a hint Of the Fountain of agony, ecstasy, gentleness, force; The Designer of studious suns, the Conceiver of space, And the Lender of Christ to the world as the blossom of grace. I refuse to accept any legend of Godhead as clothed With a flame for concealing the Author and Giver of light. I believe that the beautiful Earth and the Heaven are betrothed, As conveyed by the Prophets God sent to establish the right And announce His regard. It is true. I am working His will If I look for His face (as I shall) when a cloud rushes clear Of the pines that belong to His cloistered abode on the hill, Or the cheep of a motherless nightingale hurries Him near. If the best that my heart can desire is forbidden to me, May the loss of the Vision help friends in the Vineyard to see! It is true. He is certainly here. At each bend of surprise In the lane, He is there, as expectant, my brother, as thou, With a look of redeeming benignance alert in His eyes, And the warmth of compassionate love overspreading His brow. As expectant as I, whose infirm and irregular mind Is but blackness, compared with the fire of the hallowing beam That was given for a lamp on the Cross, He is waiting to find If I know, even yet, how His price is the Deed, not the Dream; For the gift of His face to the children belongs to His plan, And the only obscurer of God is the darkness of Man. LATE-COME LOVE Let us not hurriedly consent To lose ourselves in bliss Before we gather what is meant To ripen to a kiss. But let me sit upon the ground And breathe your nearness, Child, And muse on what my heart has found To make it warm and wild. Then let my honoured head enjoy The pillow of your knee, And learn how strangely like a toy A past of grief can be. If then I feel your fingers smooth The roughened years away, And touch the forehead you can soothe With hope and holiday, How fails the world? It neither fails Of fire, nor starves my need, But, like a ship of wonder, sails The zenith, gathering speed, And foams toward the harbour where My head shall learn to rest By rising, falling, on the fair Young tideway of your breast. Let us not hurriedly consent To lose ourselves in bliss Before we harvest what is meant To ripen to a kiss. ENOUGH A friend is fond of telling me That when at last my covered face Is hidden, I shall only be A nerveless traveller in space To whom the ages will assign The simple office of a clod. I answer: Is the end so fine? Thank God! Another tells me I shall hear My name announced, and stand before The marvellous Eyes, supremely clear, That search me to the very core; Shall hear Him bid me tend His vine, Collect the stones, upturn the sod. I answer: Is the end so fine? Thank God! For me, I shall not ask to know If Prophets here are false or true, Since plainly I am meant to go Alert among my kind, and do My best unfalteringly to keep Love's ploughshare straight, as in a field, And bid my neighbours come to reap The yield. UNWORTHINESS Who knocks? 'Tis He for whom thou hast not cared to spend A pennyweight of love on God, thy Friend, This day. Come in! If I have failed so long, 'tis surely meet That I should kneel and wash my Saviour's feet To-night. Since noon, Though journeying through the ripened harvest-lands, I rubbed no ear of corn between my hands For food. This loaf, With all that now is spread upon the board, Together with my instant service, Lord, Is thine. Convey Thy heart to love! A furlong from thy door Live those to whom thou should'st have run before With bread. Behold! The very loaf that thou hast given to Me I give to God, Who gives it back to thee, In faith. Now run, And with the tears of those sad friends of Mine, Mingle, if thou would'st be forgiven, thine, At last. But think, Before thou runnest, why it was not meet That thou should'st bring a bowl and wash my feet To-night. THEIR SACRAMENT “While you and I are standing underneath An edge of moon, before the birth of rest, To hear the nightjar calling on the heath That England lends him as a bridal guest, Our hearts, being mated now and well-content, So call each other by the deathless tune Of ecstasy, that lips on lips are spent In teaching dawn the miracle of noon, And Love himself is satisfied with June. “This is new knowledge honied to delight; And we, as scholars of emotion, stand In quick and grave acceptance of a night By wings of Joy and Revelation fanned. I bend my head above the touching grace Of hair and temples, studying the gleam Of bright unearthliness upon the face That, even snowier than an infant beam Surrendered by the moon, is living dream. “This is the meeting-point of pilgrims tired By uncompanioned travel in the vast Expanse of duty; valorous, and fired With hope of exultation won at last. This is the moment when the thirsty miles Accept their fountains; when the saviour green Conceals the rock; when all the desert smiles Forgetful of the sand that once had been, For half a life, the only footing seen. “Had I but known how certainly I fared Toward the bright oasis that is You, The leagues of desert had been bravelier dared, The scorching furnace in the naked blue; Yet now Immensities are satisfied To grant this absolution from the test: I feel beneath my hand your bending side, And know that when my head desires to rest You want it as the loading of your breast. “Once more the nightjar sounds the piercing truth Entrusted to his brain when Wisdom's hand Fell open, and a child of Love and Youth Was dropped upon the sheltering heatherland. You turn to me and sing your heart with eyes Of stilly music. In the world above, Beyond the veiling of a million skies, The angels, watching as we homeward move, Run to their King and cry for human love.” HIS MARRIAGE “Across the moor a solemn rook Flaps bedward. Turn, Delight, and look From east to west, where downward slips The midday student of your lips And freckles. He would have you stay, Before you touch that disarray Of hair, as when he wildly threw, Or so it seemed, his heart to you In joy from his tremendous tower of blue. “How worthy of a whispering bride This ceremonial eventide, This shutting of the golden book, This moorland's benedictory look! Are we together? Is it true That I am handfast here with you At nightfall where at noon we found A harebell camp, with bracken round, And hid, and smiled, and loved on holy ground? “How long we lived apart! How long Did letters, each a clearer song, Convey the truth from shire to shire Till hearts were aching with desire To hear the living voice, and tell In sound what Love had writ so well. Time dropped at last a thornless day While faring smoothly on his way, And his September was our First of May. “You blossomed near a furze-bush. There My startled spirit was aware That Tenderness had given birth To you, and consecrated Earth, And chosen both of us to be Renowned in Love's Anthology. Flower of the heathland, yet again, Before we find the curving lane, Bloom on my heart and whisper of my reign!” HIS BRIDE All work is over, Fragrance! Come and bloom Among the books and papers in my room. Come with a bubble of laughter. Firmly hug Your knees while flowering radiant on the rug, And be a language better than the Tongue That's proud to keep the heart of Shakespeare young. Three hours have passed since, bending down to share The sunrise captive in a web of hair, I learned again what Love is glad to teach: How beautifully Silence fails of speech. Three hours have perished. Adjectives and nouns, Frettings, and tiny trenches made by frowns, And duels fought between my work and play, And violent magnets tearing me away From foolscap to the circle of the bed Of pansies brightly looking at your head, Have wearied me at last, though Duty tried To imitate the sweetness of a bride. Swift as a startled blackbird, speed to bloom Amid the paper jungle in my room, And, with the hurry of your panting breath, Puff Tyrant Semi-colon to his death! Then sit as you delight to sit, and hug Your knees while dimpling on the Persian rug; Or bend above the manuscript, to look How fast you grow and blossom in my book; Or dart behind the sofa when I say I've kissed you only fifty times to-day. I think the pansies have already spent The whole, or most, of their astonishment At being petted here for half an hour By such a velvety and puzzling Flower. All work is done, my Radiance! Smile and bloom— A bud of immortality—in my room; For there, with you to listen and reply, The rug's a flower-bed, and the ceiling sky. TO ALFRED HAYES 'Tis very sad; for you, my Friend, Have scarcely time to talk to me, Though once we often used to wend Along the lanes of liberty To watch the peaceful pigeons flow By airy rivers to the oaks; But that was when the world could go By leisures, not by lightning-strokes. What tribute we have paid to Time, In puckers, dreams, perplexities, Since last we saw a generous lime Give alms of gold to woodland bees! Warm in the grass, without a care, Our hearts unloaded, senses blithe, We watched the swallow reap the air Above us with his feathered scythe. We gazed across Religion's sky To many worlds succeeding this, With lives to live, with deaths to die, And even then but threatened bliss; Till, daunted by the very heat Ourselves had fed, we dropped from pain And loved an English heaven, sweet With angels flowering in the lane. Do you recall, my more than friend, My brother almost, what we heard When there was time for us to spend In seeking night's delicious bird? Raptured we stood, as if one breast, One finer breathing, held the pair As holy pilgrims near the nest That Love had built so wisely there. 'Tis Memory's bird in Memory's ear That nowadays must sing his song; For daylight's work is more severe, And dark must daylight's work prolong. Not with the peace we knew of yore We rise from sleep and front our load; A wolf (beware!) is at the door, And others wait along the road. Seldom again shall we possess As country gods the moor and down, And watch the arrowy streamlet press His lips against the banks of brown; For man, by daring to despise Such riches as he would not count, Has filled with tears the startled eyes Of Him that preached upon the Mount. There follow wrongs and agonies In multitudes that shame the Cross Established for the death of these By Love that shone divine in loss; There follow crippled souls, and hate, Distorted hearts and bleeding time, Hypocrisy in robes of state, And labour blackened to a crime. The Spring is here. We see the Spring From windows misted by our sighs. The Summer comes, to add the sting Of prison while the Summer dies. How many years have left us since We bronzed in company, and stood Beneath the shepherd's hoary quince (Now dead) near Consolation Wood! Lift up your head, my Friend, to look Across the widening gulf to me. Imagine by the careless brook The daffodils we used to see. Although the town will have us stay To share its follies and unrest, We keep (thank God!) the windy play Of cowslips nodding in the breast. I often think the very flowers Along the lane we loved to roam Must wonder in the shine and showers Why both are kept so fast at home. What of the lustrous clearings set Within the hyacinth-haunted wood? Turn, turn to foolscap! We forget How many covet us our food. 'Tis very sad. My dearest Friend Has scarcely time to lift his head; And yet we often used to wend Along the fields with blossoms spread, And watch the peaceful pigeons flow Down airy rivers to the oaks; But that was when the world could go By leisures, not by lightning-strokes. THE PUBLISHER There came a merry publisher To publish in the pears, Without a biting thought of gold, His well-selected wares. From tall and budded premises He meant with easy skill To advertise his book of song As far as Ladslove Hill. Cuckoo! The shop was full of blossoming Convenience for his wares, With May's entrancing pigeon-holes And several flights of stairs. A house of business never looked So fresh and cool and clean Beneath its coat of vivid white With shadowings of green. Cuckoo! When Beauty drummed upon my pane, As only Beauty dares, She told me how the publisher Was vaunting local wares. We ran together in delight Toward the fragrant shop, And ere we reached its open door We heard a volume drop. Cuckoo! I glanced at Beauty. In her eyes, Which blueness ever shares With grey half-willing to be blue, She worshipped place and wares. At once there frolicked in my heart A fancy meet to tell Her whispering breast; when suddenly Another volume fell. Cuckoo! Perhaps the publisher alone Could not have killed my cares By dropping in the orchard grass Two samples of his wares; But when my Love was pleased to add Her catalogue of grace, What happy springs of boyish blood Gushed hotly to my face! Cuckoo! THE SETTLEMENT Inside the room a mother's breath Issued in grievous moans; Outside the chamber Life and Death Haggled in undertones. They passed the doorway. Life bent down, Kissing the new-come child; Death, who had entered with a frown, Looked at his share, and smiled. THE IMMORTAL LEAF The dove, while perched upon the camel's hump, Was wounded by the mother in her breast; A faded eagle, souring on a stump Of olive-wood, desired a king and nest. To many a fierce and fretted nature, Life Recalled the melody of cub and chick: The little leopards' sinewy game of strife, The goslings, coloured as a wheaten rick. Then Noah, taking in his hand the dove, Called Japhet's bonny daughter from her friend, The tall flamingo. Help me now, my Love! For backs as old as mine are stiff to bend. The wish to live and pair in native pride Is burning in our midst. The Father willed The dove's demand. She shall not be denied A search for twigs, that she may plan and build. The shutter creaked and opened. Then the bird, Convulsive, tore away from Noah's hand While every creature in the prison stirred With newborn hope of liberty and land. The dove flew home. She perched, without a sign Of exultation, on the camel's hump, And watched a lamb (too young as yet to pine) Distrust the faded eagle on her stump. A seven-days' grieving followed till again The feathered scout leapt roughly to the air To search for woods that whispered in her brain Of children she had loved and guarded there. Then was it found—the one immortal leaf! Then was it found and gathered. In the Ark It stung with joy the prisoners stung with grief, And glistened in their dreams throughout the dark. THE GAME Though Lizzie clearly heard His step, she did not speak, But waited for his lips Upon her cheek. The Father in the gloom Went softly to the bed, And laid his own beside His daughter's head. Yet not a single word Was spoken by the pair Of lovers with a love They lived to share; For Lizzie had to wait, And Father had to choose The moment for his voice To murmur, “Whose?” This spoken, with the heart's Amazing tenderness, He heard the little child's Low whisper, “Guess!” There, in the peaceful dark, The game was now half played Between the wifeless man And raptured maid. The Father whispered then, As part of the design, The beauty and the love Contained in “Mine.” To Lizzie fell the bliss At last of making known The truth by calling out, “Your—very—own!” Thus, in the peaceful dark, The game was once more played Between the stricken man And blissful maid. AFTER THE CONFLICT I This is what the Snowdrop said To the Crocus in the bed Near the old green potting-shed: Shall we, in our simple way, Show the Peoples how to pray For Christian Peace from day to day? Near the old green potting-shed, This is what the Crocus said To the Snowdrop in the bed: Empty dreaming. While we stay Do not fret our holiday. As Man's a slayer, let him slay. But the Snowdrop, thus denied When her bosom-friend replied, Breathing very quickly, cried: Little temples would be wrong Not to call the Fierce and Strong To Matins and to Evensong. Thereupon the Crocus, led Suddenly to Mercy, said, Bending down his conquered head: Neighbour, have your gentle way. Plead with God for Man, and say That I, His Crocus, also pray. II Two hours a day he used to come And bend above a masterpiece The head that sculptors would have longed To copy for the World of Greece. Men taught him how to kill his kind, And shipped him off to Italy; And there the boy was stung to death In April by a leaden bee. In falling thus so very soon Where Right and Wrong and Passion trod, He went, as he desired to go, With hands unbloodied to his God. III Because I felt the largeness of a little loss, I went to see my Saviour hanging on His Cross Beside the road to Headley, where I found the grace Of moonlight slumbering on His holy face. Behind Him, in three rows, each underneath the sign That Jesus Christ of Nazareth made divine, One hundred troopers, late of Canada, reposed, Their fighting over and their living stories closed By Death, who, glancing at the gentle Figure raised As Shepherd of that folded flock, in silence praised The wounds that did not heal. While lonely there I stood, Bareheaded in the moonlight, lifting to the Good And Patient both my hands, and in my hands the pride I felt at being a scholar of the Crucified, I grieved that I had walked across the silvered moor So fast, with such a starveling sorrow to deplore, When Christ was sadly listening to the prayers that sped From mothers' lips in Canada to where the dead, While waiting for the end of all this earthly loss, Rest near their meek Commander on His Cross Beside the road to Headley. If you pass that way, Christian, improve your heart by stopping there to pray. IV When Cousin stood In Consolation Wood, She flung her gloves away And chattered like a jay. When Father found Sweet violets on a mound, He said, We ought to pick A cross of them for Dick. When Mother stood In Consolation Wood, She lifted both her hands To God. He understands. Had Jesus found Us gathering on the mound, He would have told us news Of him we had to lose. V A face like hers I had never seen: The lips were leaden, the eyes were green; Each bone declared itself, and thrust Against the skin with the force of lust. The teeth were such as the winter years Yellow and slant in the mouth when nears The thud of the graveyard spade; the hair (Such as the ravening Furies wear In many a golden master-strain Sung by the fine Athenian brain), Reeking of liniment, ether and smoke, Was fit for only a devil to stroke. Over the desert and famine of breast The hands of a seeming corpse were pressed Hard on a gown that was sticky with rum And blood of the colour of rotten plum. How roughly had Passion worked to cake The feet with poisonous mud, and make Her daunting body a guy, to stand, As a gift for God, in a Christian Land! She begged a copper or two of me By right of her name. She was Victory. VI The Messenger returned And glorious burned With glory not his own Beside the Throne. “How fares my world?” God said. He bowed his head. “Love they the Son I lent?” He lower bent. “Worship the Crucified?” The Angel sighed. “Honour the Law He kept?” The Angel wept. “Thy speechlessness,” said God, “Is like a rod. Almost I wish my Son Elsewhere had gone; For children of the dust Reproach my trust. Too long have they denied His broken side A balm; they use each year That traitor spear; They write above His head A mock, instead Of kneeling to accept The tears He wept; But still His shining love Endures above All follies and all sins, And, therefore, wins.” “My only Son, draw near To us and hear. Hast thou the heart to go Again below, To tread afresh for Me Gethsemane, And stretch Thyself in loss Upon the Cross In mortal bitterness?” Christ answered, Yes. FOUND Last Night I dreamed my happy way to Heaven. How many books had told of gate and guard, Of Spirits crowding near their battlements To watch a giant sun's cohering gold Alarm the distant comet! Not a gate Of jasper glistened; not an angel scanned The road of sky between his world and ours; No seraph, travelling Godward to report His news of far dominions quick with life, Magnificently drove along the air A splendour such as fasting Vision saw And named for ever in the Testament Of Israel. In front of me there stretched, With flanking woods and shrubberies, a space Of lawnland green as January moss And level as a sea when unprovoked To wrath by heady challenges of storm. Though plainly far from home, I did not guess (Because the trees and shrubs and blossoming Were like familiars greatly loved on Earth) That then, in truth, I walked the very Land Renowned in books of angel-hearted song By those on whom descended spiritual fire; Yet Apprehension, fretting mind and soul, By nothing louder than her voicelessness Proclaimed the instant death of what was old, Announced the cry and stir of what was new. No power forbidding, I began to move Toward the far-off point where wooded edge And wooded edge, as friends allowed to meet, By curving, neared at last a green embrace; And did not pause, till underneath a foot I heard the voice of brittleness, and found A leaf, and then beheld a sister leaf As brown as withered finery strewn above The hopeful bracken working underground To be a bridesmaid on the wedding-day When Earth and Autumn marry. Then I thought, As one by many a prophet told that Death Can never blight a lily-bud in Heaven, “This leaf, being dead, reveals that I as yet Have failed to reach the Tomb of Sinfulness, Where God alone is central and supreme; For seasons are but foam upon the tides Of birth and perishing; and here those tides Advance, recede, since what was green is brown.” While standing thus to think about the leaf I heard a footstep very close behind, And, turning, saw a girl about to pass. Her eyes, so confident, so purely beamed, Sent holiness to mine. As cool as leaves, As grave as hills, without allure, she passed And showed her tallness, and (for thus I thought) A motion that proceeded less from her Than from a shadowed fount of beauty known To none but Music. Often had I seen, Walking as though in harmony with that On which they trod, the feet of earth-born maids Convey the sense of song; but none had moved As moved the girl in front of me. Our world And she were not companions; yet I felt How very far she was from being a proof That I explored a lonely part of Heaven, And deemed her studious in a halting-place Betwixt Mortality and Angelhood. Now far ahead, she paused awhile, then ran Toward the left, and made as if she sought To look behind a tree, or down a path Of woodland invitation. Then I saw Another come, a basket full of flowers Upon her arm. The golden tint of these Reminded me of Surrey daffodils In days of yore, when beds of blossoming (Not understood) prevented me from play, Because my Mother often called to me And begged my pinafore. (I thank her now.) The women stopped to kiss, and she whose flowers Had made my memory bloom, began to ask, As clearly showed, if I were known to them. The girl turned round, and underneath her palm Looked long and hard at me. They kissed again, And then the girl moved on toward the path. The other drew a blossom from the store Within her basket, held it on her lips, And, motionless as marble, gravely stood To watch me come across the level lawn; But when perhaps no more than ninety yards Withheld from me the colouring of her lips, The Statue dropped the flower; yet even then Remained a Statue. The basket likewise fell, Rolled over, rocked a little, lay as stone. One heartbeat more, and Mother, loud with love, So quickly ran that, almost ere I knew, The triumph and the tumult of her heart Were beating on my own; her lips were held As fast to mine as moss to roots of oak. Now, having kissed my boy once more—once more, I want to sit and spend my heart with him Among the frolic memories of time Endeared to me by Breathing Littleness. Do you remember strawberries growing wild Three fields away from home? And where we went On many a Sabbath afternoon to tell The ferns how much we loved them, Norman dear, And ask a married blackbird or a thrush To sing again his loveliest piece of song? Do you remember when you tore my frock By clinging while the adder raised his head To daunt us near the camp of marigolds? Can you recall— How else could I have learnt The style and greatness of that noble Land? 'Twas Heaven, in truth; for where my Mother dwells She makes for me the one and only Heaven. HONEYSUCKLE I thank the Honeysuckle! Both perplexity and grief Are lessened when I find her at the bottom of the lane, Since the confidence and courage of her young green leaf Revive my own again. She hurries to be verdant, as though she understands How Winter can be conquered by the beauty that was stored In the buds so long preparing to be clean and wholesome hands Uplifted to her Lord. She notes the greedy flowering of black-thorn by her side, And wonders how he cares to spend his excellence so soon; For the shaping of her miracle is slow and dignified, And busies her till June. I thank the Honeysuckle! If I guard the holy bloom Entrusted to my keeping, in as diligent a way, I shall be alert and helpful in the Master's ante-room, And scent my little day. MY LOVE-SONG I am chuckling to myself While I think about you, Death, And the progress of your plan For the stopping of my breath, Since I quiver with a love You can never overwhelm Though you stretch me on my back In a narrow box of elm. Though you creep to give my eyes What you say is lasting rest; Though you stoop to hold my hands Till they stiffen on my breast; Though you hammer at the nails In the lid above my face, I shall live as long as Time Whirls the planet round in space. Though you fidget with the spade Till the parson's prayer is said, And begin to shovel clods In a fury on my head, I shall merely nod to Love My amusement at the sound While you fill the cheated trap To the brim with useless ground. How mistakenly you toil! Do you think that I can die Of an illness on the earth Or an illness in the sky? Having felt the longed-for heart Tell its story on my own, I shall pulse with endless youth Underneath my cross of stone. DAVID, GOLIATH, THOU Every evening came a lad, Ere the coming of the dark; Whirled the leathern sling he had, Loosed his pebbles at the mark. When the spearmen paled and shook, When the Captains held their breath, David, running to the brook, Bent to find the foeman's death. Using still his ancient plan, Evil comes in rage and throws Broadcast into every man Seed from which Goliath grows. Then's the time to do and dare! Run as David ran, and take Quickly from the Stream of Prayer Pebbles for thy Captain's sake. TO A THRUSH SINGING MADLY I'm getting old, delirious bird, I'm getting old and grey, But still I echo every word Of all the words you say. The planet beaming with a girl So feather-fine as she Upon the lilac is the pearl Of planets? I agree. I'm getting old, delirious thrush. My back is not so straight As when I often used to rush To leap the five-barred gate That meant a nearer way to Nance, Whose eyes and lips were mine When days were roses of romance And air itself was wine. I'm getting old, delirious bird, I'm getting old and slow; Yet April thanked me when she heard My heartbeat long ago! The little patch of reverend white To-day above my ears Is less than nothing in the light Of all my dimpled years. 'Tis time will play some other tricks Before my final bed, And make me, with a pair of sticks, A human quadruped. So be it. I shall crawl along My few untrodden miles, In love with thrushes for their song, And Memory for her smiles. THE PAIN To-day, a little after four, I heard behind me on the floor The feet of Death approach my table. The killing pain was doubled; yet His nod was dared, his eyes were met, His hand was shaken off my shoulder. I felt God close to me, and said, “Dost thou demand my fallen head, And is this Presence of Thy sending?” I did not hear Him speak; but Death Frowned as in rage, and caught his breath, And left me livid at my table. THE QUEST IN THE VINEYARDS 'Tis often asked of me if I desire, Through an advantage somehow won from Death, To struggle back to heartbeats from the grave (When Time has won his victory over breath And Passion's double furnace and that brave Conjunction of a god and of a slave Here known as Man) and be alert once more On a globe throbbing with surprises. To bear the load of manhood for the hours Decreed, and bear it always with content, Is duty to the Vineyard where I give My sinews to the Master who has lent Such fires and forces as continual live To supplement the wise provocative Compelling us from sloth toward the stars In the hushed wilderness of ether. Believe me, in my honest way I dig Among the vines, and heap the sombre stones. Yet while I stoop to prune the Master's grapes, Aware in secret of His heartening tones, I breathe my yearning for celestial shapes In whispered song that brokenly escapes And shows how waveringly my heart belongs To the broad bosom of my homeland. Not even if the friends that used to work, When I was young, not many yards from me, Came back, with consolations learnt above, And gathered at my side, would I agree To bear afresh man's load of hate and love, And fevers that as evil spirits move Along the orbit of his blood, to pulse In the old theatre of existence; For always with invisible lips a voice Well known is murmuring, “Come to me”; and so I cannot burn with zeal again to tread From purpling row of vines to purpling row And duly take from God, with reverent head, At eve His punctual penny for my bread, When dewiness has come, and planets stare At the dark clusters in the grapefields. Yet how I thank Him for His warming gift Of streams and birds and flowers and trees! If granted in a second world to strain The rope of twisted life, I beg that these Enrich me there and help me to refrain From honied folly, wrath, and ruinous gain, And dastardly retreats from holiness On the broad battlefield of Conscience. Great Master, though my shoulders plainly bear The livid bruises proper to the weight Of baskets loaded to the brim for Thee, I must not wince, nor murmur at my fate, Nor hang my lip, nor turn as if to flee If heavier Vineyard burdens fall to me. Since Thou art Knowledge, I must be alert For the clear syllables of Wisdom. Shall once again my spirit overflow With joy among deliberative throngs Of oaks and elms and beeches, where the best Of natural balm and holiness belongs? And shall I feel again the conquering zest That filled a heart nigh bleeding for the guest Of love? Shall I have songs to sing Of the flushed umber of the elm-bloom? What balm has fallen upon me from the bough, Only Thy measuring heart could ever tell, Creator of the Songbird! Yet my dreams Are radiant with an unfamiliar dell Surrounded by a pair of brother streams With babble on their lips, where stands and gleams My starlit Mother pointing to a nest In the bent elbow of a sapling. I needs must follow Her from world to world And pay for Her with such laborious strife As means the strange unfolding of Thy plan For life that grows and blossoms out of life. Once more renew the Nazareth ban Of poverty, and set me in the van Of those with sorest shoulders, to be strong In the slow plucking of Thy harvest. Since man is of Thy lineage, and designed, As overshadowed littleness, to break At last his palace-prison, and to rise To larger truth, he shall not then forsake The wearied sinew. In his clearing eyes Shall brood his faith in yet forbidden skies Above a richer vineyard. He will glow With the bright hardship of his lesson. For Thou art Work. Thy holiday hath been, And still must be, the splendour of the task; And Thou wilt lift us high, and higher yet, And never grant the languid Heaven we ask; But teach us how with truth to pay our debt In loyal service, eager to forget The dream of thornless roses told to us In the waste leisures of indulgence. Thou, Ceaseless Worker, wilt not have me stand Breast-deep in heavenly lilies day by day Among recovered friendships; yet allow Me time to search where haply She might stray, As here of old, beneath the forest bough In solitude, before I breathe a vow Conveying me to Thee, and smile, and stoop To the next labour of Redemption. THE TALENT Where is the Talent that I lodged with Thee? Lord, I have saved it all. What the enlargement thou hast brought to Me? Lord, it is very small. How comes it that thou hast not spent Thy heart and soul to supplement In fitting measure what was lent? Most of my days were full of piercing dread. Christ taught thee not to cower. Many came often, asking me for bread. I sent thee heavenly flour. These shoulders and these hands were sore; Thus, thinking I could do no more, I failed to make the Talent four. How if thy Saviour had not worked in loss? Lord, I confess the wrong. How if thy Saviour had refused the Cross? Thy question makes me strong. Be sure that I have seen thy ways, As I have heard thy frozen praise And counted thy destructive days. Since I can hear the quiet breath of prayer, Which comes from Earth, to tell, More than thou dreamest, of the living care Of those that love thee well, Once more receive the Talent. Let it be An urgent signalling to thee That sloth and coldness anger Me. Trust me to work, however dark the road. My lamp is filled and lit. Tenderly put Thy hand upon the load. I steady thee and it. If heart and spirit swear to bow Beneath My will, and hold the vow, Thy Talent trebles even now. THE LIKENESS Elizabeth is floating on the tide of sleep That drifts her onward to the Holy Day Of Him whose star was bright above the sheep. Elizabeth is stirring. Will the Old Man dare To put his sack of toys upon the floor And kiss a trail of wonder-woven hair? Elizabeth, the pillow and the trail are wet. The Old Man loved your Mother; and he shed Those tears for one too precious to forget. LOVE If Love were only kissing, then Love were a sorry thing for men; But Love is trying how to bless A home with strength and tenderness; And working hard to buy the bread, And bonnets for a little head; And daily bringing home a life Of honour to an earnest wife; And duly naming at the board The style and mercy of the Lord; And watching in the children's growth The beauty of the marriage-oath; And proving that a young desire, Though flame, was consecrated fire. If Love were only kissing, then Love were a sorry thing for men. AN APOLOGY I beg your pardon, Life! Had I been fair, And done you simple justice, hour by hour, I often should have helped you not to wear A look as if you tasted something sour. When discipline was over, how you ran To bring, as consolation after strife, The very joy a desert-faring man Desired the most! I beg your pardon, Life! THE CLUSTER OF TEMPTATION The carriers of the figs were far ahead With them that bore the gathered load Of pomegranates, since they had lighter sped Than two that ached along the desert road. These twain had lost the vanguard. Full of care, They toiled across a ridge of billowed sand Beneath the rocks that weariness must dare While journeying homeward from the Promised Land. Cried sunburnt Joshua, the resolute, Yet almost travel-broken, pioneer, While lifting down the glorious bunch of fruit From off his shoulder, “Eventide is near; Go, Caleb! It were like our God to give, Perchance for but an hour of time, to quell The thirst that barely suffers us to live His honest servants, a reviving well. Go, Caleb! Yet, if thou wilt guard the prize We vowed upon our knees to carry whole To where the anxious heart of Moses tries To be as valiant as his valiant soul, Thy friend and comrade, howsoever spent By what has been for thee a hard distress, Will go to look if haply God has lent A jewel of water to His wilderness.” Then Caleb answered, “Thou hast given thy work Not only to the bunch and to the stern Commandment of thyself, too brave to shirk The perilous going and the rough return, But also hast created for thy friend A second heart, and lifted him beyond Betrayal of the promise to defend, In union with thyself, his sacred bond. Be mine the search for water! Mine the joy, If God permit, of bringing it to thee! Guard thou the grapes, that nothing shall destroy The cluster thou hast often saved from me.” Then Caleb tottered forward. Keen his look Among the broken rocks; intent his prayer For but the cool beginning of a brook, Till darkness gloomed his spirit with despair. In turn anear the prize the heroes slept, And dreamed of home and peril and escapes; And, loyal as the stars above them, kept Their faith as flawless as the bunch of grapes. Such were Jehovah's Captains. Such the hearts He made and reared, He strengthened and controlled. We find them beating in a hundred parts Of Scripture. We, not they, are growing old. HOME FROM BUSINESS Our little bud of Paradise Is wakeful, Father. I suppose His clever brain already knows That if he bubbles long enough His head will lean against the rough Attraction of your overcoat. The more I sing him lullabies, The more persistently he tries To tell me frankly to my face That what he wants is Daddy's bass, Especially the deepest note. I heard you in the hall, and flew— How lovely! This is mine for you!— At once to disarrange your hair And turn you into Baby's bear. Now, while I set the cloth for tea And make the toast, run up and be A sleepy sound instead of me! IN SCHOOL Not what I ought to be, To-day, is vexing me. I have not finished yet The lesson I was set; And, being still intent On what the Master meant, I shall not always try The patience of the Sky. For if I stoop above The lesson-book, in love Of Him by whom were made The rules to be obeyed, I know that He will bless With praise my steadiness, And show me, in a while, His rare and sudden smile. THE LOVER OVERWHELMED Another week must perish ere the rose That ebbed from scarlet when the world was young And reached at last the colour of the moon She envied, while a second blossom yearned Toward the tinting of a woodgirl's mouth, Can breathe her fragrant willingness to give A golden cargo to the merchant bee; But many a month shall wither, as the leaves That wait in brownness for the birth of Christ, Ere You, a bud become a flower, shall hear The voice of Love's convincing majesty Demand your bosom, sweetened by a pain, And such as almost lags the foot of Time And causes Death himself to envy Life. Not yet the broken sleep; the wilderness Of wondering if the only man whose head Is fit to share your pillow names a star Afresh, and loves you in a home of sky; Or frets to learn how often in his book A studied page becomes a tyrannous blank, Its verses barren of their central truth, Because the singer is less strong than Love. Not yet the morning clouded by the sun; The cheek entrusted to the roughened bark Of cool and comforting oak; the sudden tears When lilac breathes too heavily, and fills The cup of Longing with her loyal scent. I see you take the air with lips as vowed To steadiness as fronded moss to elm. Within your clouded eyes not yet are seen Those other eyes that, when the body and soul Begin to whisper in the June of life A music sweeter than a quivering harp Can give at eventide to God in Heaven, Must open for the lamping of a truth So long kept prisoner in the holy place Where girlishness, content by drawing breath, And breathing with a pansy's quietude, Awaits beside a rosebush laden with buds The sceptre and the master-word of Love. You blossom in the heavy soil of work From sunleap till the hooding of the day. Beneath my sober diligence you move, A melody and haunting. If I touch A leaf or flower, I seem to touch your hand; The snow-white lupin tells me of your neck; The softness of the forest bee is yours; The whitethroat in the bramble, she is you; The bubbling of the streamlet near a cove Of watercress is merriment as fair As yours when happy with a kitten held Against the mouth that coaxes him to purr. My heart is quick to feel the grief of love; And when a blackbird, darting from the hedge, Goes anguished down a lane, as though assured That home is lost for ever, I bewail Her panic, and the bitterness among The tiny naked copies of herself. My heart is spoken. If the minute comes When long restraint is shattered, and, as leaves, My useless words have withered in the air, Defeat shall stand a conqueror till the end, Since love, if finely dedicated, burns A man to godhead, giving such a light As makes his very coffin seem a star. SNOWDROP To-day I stood for half an hour To watch a little Christian flower That prayed beside a fence. Her humble and devoted look, As if she read a sacred book, Was breathless reverence. I think the Snowdrop must have been Quite close to Jesus once, and seen A revelation then That made her promise Him to be His angel of humility For women and for men POOR, PLAIN, AND PALE I know her sort in many a street, Thanks be to God! since thus He wills His poorer servants to defeat With roughened hands a thousand ills. So hard in Life's Tremendous Shop We hunt successes, that we find Ourselves too rarely moved to stop And wait for stragglers far behind. Though unattractive, as you say, She's loyal to her daily load From six o'clock till nearly ten. Remove her from the list of souls The great Machine of Life controls, And how's the World to manage then? She's flat of chest, untimely hurt By pushing up the topless hill Through pain and poverty and dirt The load that never may be still. But, singing on her daily round, With crumbs to reckon, babes to nurse, In many a troubled home she's found Declaring things might well be worse. She's unattractive, it is true, But what a star of shabbiness, With light to give, with pluck to dare! Remove her from the list of souls The vast Machine of Life controls, And how's the worried World to fare? The roses of her maiden hours Upon her cheeks no more are found; Too soon, too soon these welcome flowers Dropped in the washtub and were drowned. No wonder wrinkles hurrying came, For signs of how, at war with life, She withered grimly in the flame That burns the hunger-haunted wife! She's unattractive, it is true, While toiling in her threadbare gown To make the right come out of wrong. Remove her from the list of souls The queer Machine of Life controls, And how's the world to rub along? Behold her planning late at night, With furrowed brows and eyelids red, The morrow's struggle, in the sight Of Him who gives the daily bread! She begs of God with heart and mind That at the entrance of the day Her toilworn hands shall fail to find A stone too big to roll away. She's unattractive, be it said, But not the kind to sit and groan, Or rust because her eyes are wet. Remove her from the list of souls The grim Machine of Life controls, And how's the world to pay its debt? She's working in a throng of cares, As woman never worked before, To drive away the wolf that tears Its dreadful message on her door. She's scrubber, comforter, and nurse, Supporting hand, forgiving face, Consoler, fairy, bootblack, purse, Hymn and cathedral of the place! She's unattractive, as you know, But how she helps the sunshine warm The days that God is pleased to give! Remove her from the list of souls The huge Machine of Life controls, And how's the tangled World to live? MOTHER'S LILAC Twenty times to-day, at fewest, Have I left my work and room, Just to stand beside the newest Bunch of fragrant lilac-bloom. Twenty times to-day my worry Vanished; and an eager child, Listening to a voice in Surrey, Clapped his rosy hands and smiled. How my Mother loved to bring me Where the lilac's breath was sweet, Stoop, and gather force, and swing me Off my pair of little feet! Such a Mother, true and merry, Must have held me to the plum, Apple, bullace, damson, cherry When their wedding-days had come; Yet, in moods of recollection, Ere the evening lamp is lit, When her blossoms of affection Scent my room, and hallow it, Mother comes again and brings me Sunshine at a darkened hour; Stoops, and gathers force, and swings me Only to the lilac-flower. Thus the lilac will not let me Bend for long a weary head Over toil my duties set me Now that labour buys the bread. Twenty times to-day, at fewest, Have I left my work and room, Just to stand beside the newest Bunch of Long Ago in bloom. UNSHEPHERDED If Christ prepares another John to say, Ye cold and stubborn! is the only way A Second Coming and a Second Loss, Redeeming thus the failure of the Cross? Shall not His lovers answer?—Stricken Lord, Where doves were sold, Thy Bishops bless the sword. Come down and make us what we should have been, Thy only Westminster the Village Green. THE FIRST RAINBOW Compelled to punish for their sin The stubborn children on His earth, The Master called His angels in From parks of melody and mirth, And charging them in faith to keep Their Paradise with seriousness Till He returned from out the deep, He lifted up His hands to bless. As there they knelt, the Master showed The mighty stature of His wings, And, fronting the celestial road, Flew earthward with His sorrowings. But when the swiftness of His pace Had won for Him the half-way part, There blossomed in His eyes a face, And thoughts of Jesus touched His heart. He turned, and, quicker far than light, In homeward travel pierced the blue Till towers and temples in His sight From glory unto glory grew. The little Christ was held by dreams, And neither felt beneath Him pressed The hands, as soft as starry beams, Nor knew the change from bed to breast. Companioned by the sleeping Child, The Father in His splendour swept; Whene'er He glimpsed the Babe, He smiled, Whene'er He looked on earth, He wept. At length, where desolate mountains stood, The Maker of the world descried The bleakness of His angered mood Expressed below in deepening tide. He warmed the harebells. On a blue Expanse He laid His Son asleep Before, to win a wider view, He trod the fern along the steep; But ere He gained the topmost ground His treasured Boy from slumber woke, And, in amazement looking round, Saw heath and harebells, pine and oak. Now when He glimpsed the dark and wild Approach to Heaven, because of cloud (His heart being melted in the Child), The infant Saviour cried aloud. The Father, deep in thought above, Made answer to His Son distressed, And, with the lovely speed of love, Him caught and cradled on His breast. But Jesus, hardly yet assured Of safety in those welcome arms, His tears of dread continuous poured, And felt afresh the first alarms. At length the Saviour raised His head, And smiled to God in tremulous glee. “Depth of My Depth,” the Father said, “Behold the cloud that frightened Thee!” He pointed. What the Child had feared Redeemed the terror it had made. Upon the darkling bank appeared The Rainbow. Thus the debt was paid. THE ABSENT FLOWER The foxglove now is half asleep, Forgetful of his gloves; The woodland bee was warned to flee An hour ago from honied loves. Campanulas with cups of blue Set sideways on a pale green stem Prepare to pledge in drops of dew The stars that spend the night with them. Now it were well for thee to stand, Thy shoulder touching mine, And cause the pink and rose to think Their breathing not so sweet as thine; And prove again the noble care That Beauty spent in giving thee Her body and her soul to bear Across the hills of Time to me. Fountain and Fragrance, quickly change This northland to the south By trusting here once more the clear And scarlet girlhood of thy mouth. Come back! Amid this wealth of bloom I learn how easily a bower Of musk and lilies can be gloom That has not thee, my Flower, in flower! THE CLEANSING I could not come before. An Angel barred the door And bade me not to press Toward thy loveliness. Though we so nearly met, The Warden said, Not yet. Deservest thou content? Look down! Work on! Repent! I waited one world more; And then beyond the door I glimpsed thee in the clear Of midday drawing near. When we had almost met, The Angel said, Not yet. Wait till thy heart is pure. Look down! Work on! Endure! I questioned, “Have I strength To journey all the length Of one more world alone, Till I at last have grown Unblemished?” Then he said, Be sure that souls are fed If worthy to receive. Look down! Work on! Believe! ONWARD Life's the bird, Time the spray. Love and build, Work and play. Who was that Robbed the nest, Snapped the branch, Froze the breast? Earthly Death? Then we know What to sing, Where to go. CALVARY Calvary crosses every sea. Look on the left-hand side, Coming from Grayshott. You will be Close to the Crucified. Filling my soul with dread of pangs Sharper than spear or sword, Facing the Headley road there hangs Jesus, the living Lord. Heeding no more who comes, who goes, Deaf to the lips of Spring, Canada's soldiers sleep in rows Under their carven King. Well would it be if every one Passing should bow the head, First for the Father's sacred Son, Then for the cheated dead. DEEP LOVE Deep love will have its way. Remember how The exile Joseph, master of the corn, Gave Egypt and her cares a darkened brow What time he sorrowed for the youngest born; And how he plotted, for his heart's relief, To bring his desert-faring brother back, Pretending that the lad, become a thief, Had stolen the silver cup within the sack. Deep love will have its way. Remember how The Shepherd turned from safety in the sky And looked on slander with a beaming brow, As if it were a trivial thing to die; And how, albeit his flesh was roughly torn And drained of blood, his pure and hallowed mind Found comfort in the hope that thus was borne The golden cup of love to all mankind. STRONG IN DEATH Because the blinds were down I knew That he I loved so much had started To travel hence beyond my view And leave me lonely-hearted. Farewell was spoken then with tears. But when I whispered, “Life is colder,” The hand that helped my bitter years Seemed firm again upon my shoulder. MY THANKS All that the noble sun Can do for me is done, And he with fiery hands Is touching other lands. For all the beauty he had spread Before I left my bed And whispered on my knees a vow, I thank him fully now. I thank him for the gems he showed Along the moorland road, Where dew was waiting to arise And perish in his eyes. To prove the purple on a rook What eager pains he took! With how much gaiety he told The pheasant's brown and gold! I thank him for a dazzling view Of pigeons in the blue; I thank him for the beams with which He made my Love's hair rich. Now, grateful here beneath the pines, Among the yellow signs Of summer fallen in defeat, Though breathing treasured heat, I thank him; not alone for this Sure bread and wine of bliss, Accepted by my soul, to be A food for memory, But also for his riches spent, Without acknowledgment, On other days along the high Blue moorlands of the sky; And tell, as nuns their holy beads, The hours that fed my needs With blessings fine enough to pay For deserts of delay. All that the noble sun Can do for me is done, And now with fiery hands He touches other lands. SECOND BIRTH In darker days I trod a land Of rock and thistle, briar and sand; In darker days I bent my head As one preparing to be dead, And bore the burden of the light In patience, hoping for the night. But now, since I have lived to find The healing blossom of your mind; Since I have lived at last to share In love the flowering of your hair, I ask no more of Time and Tide, Being born again, and satisfied. DEEPHEART WOOD I've dreamed in many an ancient wood Of many a sweet and byegone kiss Exchanged between a god and girl; But never in a wood like this. Had it not grown a long-loved haunt Of deities swift as tongues of fire, Its leafy pulse could never throb In recollection of desire. Recalling how he used to count Bright acorns in a Beauty's lap, A god gave knowledge to the trees And mingled memory with their sap. So long as father oaks beget Their baby patterns, and the strength Of sunshine, working on the young, Gives bark and bough, and leaf and length; So long as passion comes in bud, And history returns in green, The Wood of Deepheart shall inform The sensitive of what has been. Be sure the now departed race Of Dryads once was numerous here! Be sure a dimpling god has lain Among the ferns, to catch a Dear! With threads of moss upon her skin She neared the trap. The god leapt tall And filled his hands with dark-brown hair . . . Enchanted sap remembers all, And tells the foliage; this reports The lovely unmolested truth Of Long Ago, and frets my heart With stabbings of recovered youth. A RECOMMENDATION Behind the Nebula there lives In loneliness, we bravely think, An Overseer, who constant gives Our feet direction to the brink Of Death, that we may slip our shell, As butterfly the chrysalis, And in another kingdom tell The truth we failed to tell in this. Perhaps the Master planned it so; And yet the thought may be a dream Among the many dreams that go As halves of shadow and of gleam In front of us. For fear we miss New life when Death has laid us flat, Suppose we learn to do in this The good we hope to do in that. THE BEREAVED I saw her Angel in my room Stand watching by the bed That now belongs to grief and gloom, Because its bride is dead. Long time in pensiveness she stayed, Forgetful of her skies, As though the spirit were afraid To burn as burned the eyes. At last she stooped. The treasured face Bowed to the heart's request To leap triumphant in the place Where once it used to rest. To think so sweet a hope should be Beyond all strain and stir! No nearer might she come to me, No closer I to her. The Truant held her wounded side Fast with her rigid hand. Poor child! so little had she died She scarce could understand. BETHLEHEM An Infant very long ago To Bethlehem was given. Around his head was seen to glow His memory of Heaven. While cradled in a manger there, He heard the oxen sighing Because they knew not how to share His Mother's lullabying. Our hearts must go to Bethlehem With joy on Christmas morning, And take the fair and sweet in them To Him for his adorning. We all should give without pretence A gift of such behaviour As breathes alone the frankincense Accepted by our Saviour. A PUPIL While she bent To her lesson, intent On duty, and her eyes Were stars for Latin, And her sighs Gently told That the classic of gold Was master, I believed That dead Catullus Woke and grieved. When she came, With her excellent flame Of newness, and her bell Of softened laughter, It was well. LATE AUTUMN Who grumbles? We have lost to Love the battle of the breast And gone, as prisoners at night, beneath a yoke of stars. Who grumbles? We have elbowed Death along a mountain-crest, And taken from the hands of Life his royal gift of scars. We touched the world, and weighed the world, and called it half a load. So many tunes were on our lips, we sang the blackbird's way, And jested at the heels of Time. The master of that road Moves on unwrinkled. We have grown veteran, stiff, and grey; But neither soured nor listless. We are marching still to find The kingdoms lost at Folly's word when Prayer and Faith were mute. What matter if the Chieftain at the cross-road stare us blind And bid us yield our heartbeats? We are ready to salute. Look yonder, where the warrior beech, allied with frost and sun, Now spreads in careless disarray his leaves along the ground, As though to bare his muscles for the conflict just begun With storms that want to see him fall in death across his mound. Not otherwise than he prepares to front the stress and gloom, And counter in his sinewy style the legions of the north, Let those of us whose feet are near the trysting-place of doom Greatheartedly give battle till the hour of setting forth. Though splintered heights refuse us, though crags are only dreams, Though Death is but a field away from scything in our wheat, There's still the lowland murmuring of confidential streams, And still a rainbow curving on the cloud of our defeat. So you, my friend, and you, my friend, and I, prepared for Home, As grey as album lavender, unsteady, stiff, and bent, Must never shame the colours of the General soon to come And march us through the defile where our worn-out fathers went. DEPARTURE “How little did I think to die Thus splendidly!” he said, “With God so near my chamber-door In quest of me, and all these four Great Angels round my bed. “The secret dam has burst; the race Of blood is running low. Without a mortal hand to hold, I lie and feel the creep of cold, And drift where I must go. “But Life and Death and Hope and Love Are here, at last agreed. As slaves obedient to their lord While feasting at his laden board, They offer all I need: “A cup of water from the spring Of never-known Content, And startled Memory's bread to eat (Some bitter, some intensely sweet)— The whole a sacrament. “Before my hands were fit to play, My dazzled eyes to see, God stooped, although I was so small, And laughed, and gave a coloured ball Of Heavenly Earth to me. “Refreshed by Angels round me here, I think of it again; Confess the damage I have wrought To many souls by lack of thought, And tremblingly explain. “Such folly, arrogance, and sin Are grievous to my view; And yet, there sounds the thrilling voice Of Mercy saying,” I rejoice To share my home with you. Although the grieving Father counts With sorrow every loss Inflicted by an unjust heart, He whispers that the greater part Is cancelled by the Cross. Enough that you were quick to name The worth of all you owed, And did not constantly forget The signposts your Redeemer set In love along the road. The Angels in a glorious group Came nearer to his bed. “How little did I think to die Thus splendidly, with God so nigh The chamber-door!” he said. THE VICTOR Love, who's a giant, has been known to bring, Of men and women destined not to meet, The hearts together, and through life to sing The only song that renders absence sweet. This is the love that, learning without eyes, Feasting on hardship, wins the supernal prize That passion shall not hold, because it dies. THE BATTLE The Wood is very sad to-night. An hour before the set of sun The Battle of Raided Flowers was won. The lovers of Spring had charged again, And bruised and crushed and torn and slain. The lovers of Spring had come and stayed Three hours too long in the primrose glade. Bunches of broken necks were tied With pieces of string and flung aside. The Wood bemoaned her heavy loss In shattered ferns and wounded moss. The doves began to think her breast Unfriendly to their marriage-nest. The tiny quadrupeds in fur Looked up reproachfully at her, As if she had not kept her troth With children of the undergrowth. The Wind began to shriek, and filled The air with news: Ten Thousand Killed! The Wood is very sad to-night. THE INSPIRATION Grown very weary of my work Afar from brook and breeze, How willingly I grant my brain A little holiday again, And spend it with the trees! Languidly musing in my chair, I make the haughty wood My servant here, and bid the throng Of doves delight me with a song To lull me while I brood. Hinges of bark begin to stir, And winds of Fancy toss The Dryad's hair in disarray As soon as she comes out to play With friends upon the moss. Oaks tell me of the steadiness My heart and spirit lack, And teach me how to clench my hand Upon the hilt of life, and stand With shoulders pressing back. How often, when my nature seems Rebellious grown, and turns, Without a thankful tear, aside So quickly from the Crucified . . . Beyond that home of ferns Who trembles into outline there, Escaped from heavenly bowers? As noiseless as the air that flows Along the glade, my Mother goes In beauty, gathering flowers. Vision refining, healing, blest! Thou bringest me the flame That burns me to the shape decreed Till sounds my bell and there is need To send me whence I came. INTERCHANGE The corner where the irises explain That Spring is busy in the world again Delights you, and you watch the solemn growth That seems to be, but is not, perfect sloth. Then I, a little farther from the bed, Can note the reverent bending of your head, And guess the adoration that is sung By bosom and spirit, silencing the tongue, And marvel how it came to pass that Earth, Not Heaven itself, was sweetened by your birth. Neither shall you depart the girl you came Nor shall these infant blossoms be the same As Evening found them when she ran to look If burly Day had bruised them in their nook; For when their miracle and yours have met As sisters, each of you must needs forget Some privacies, and offer by a strange And delicate act of subtle interchange A quality passing at this sacred hour From bloom to maiden and from maid to flower. My soul is not too coarse to be aware That you and they have sanctities to share; And, being strained and quickened by the sight Of each illumined by the other's light, Is cleansed. If very Angels had been sent, How could their wings have made me more content? CANDOUR You honour Love and Duty With syllables of gold That suit a page of azure Celestially unrolled Above the curving beauty Of Applehaven wold, My feather-breasted poet Declaiming in the cold! This lyric, almost raging With emphasis, and fed By what is darkly ancient, So pulses overhead That I, whose never-ageing Delight in verse is wed To minstrelsy, am feeling At heart discomfited. How stalwart is the fashion In which your verses flow To angel-folk above you, To country-folk below! You shake with downright passion Upon a twig; for so Your honest kind was counselled Unnumbered years ago. Enraptured by the story You publish in the air, I stand beside a bean-rick And search the poplar where, Amid a steepled glory Of leaves and branches, fair With visitors of sunlight, You lay your passion bare. To think that we, now banded So closely that we fear To tell, except in whispers, The truth you make us hear, Were long ago as candid, As splendidly sincere, When glimpsing in the woodland The bosom of our Dear! HUNTING The girl in blossom, the autumnal maid, The woman with the feeble knot of hair, The bankrupt (and behind his saddle Care), The Hawk, the tattered Birds on whom he preyed, The clean-heart youngster, the devouring jade, The penny-wise and frozen millionaire, The parson and the publican, were there, To make a fox in Leicestershire afraid. How poor this sport to me, within whose brain Another hunt was up! My hounds, unspent By leagues of running since the lips of Dawn Had tasted hoarfrost on the windowpane, Still fevered by the quarry's beauty, went Along the sweetness of my chosen fawn. A PICTURE “This room—how gay! how bright! Who gathered cones for us to burn to-night?” Love dropped the kitten to the rug, and said, “Kiss me for doing right.” “Your voice is like a song, And—Don't these hyacinths smell a little strong?” Love, with a scarlet hint of pouting, said, “Kiss me for doing wrong.” “The snowdrops make me glad. But who spilled water on my writing-pad?” Love, with repentance in a dimple, said, “Beat me for being bad.” “How could I dream of blame, With you and snowdrops, kitten, cones, and flame?” Love, with a falling of her bosom, said, “Whisper my sweetest name.” THE MILKY WAY When Jesus in his heavenly bower Was yet a little child of mirth God told him of another flower He wished to plant upon the earth; And asking if the boy inclined To company His wayfaring, He saw the answer of his mind, And made him room beneath His wing. They sped together through the bands Of travellers busy in the sky; And Jesus gaily clapped his hands As world and comet hurried by. At last in Eden's grove they trod The lawn of Man's deserted dower, And, sighing very deeply, God Took from His breast the Passion-Flower. 'Twas planted. Then the shining Pair Looked zenithward, and left the earth For which the younger's love and care Were destined, through his second birth. The rounded constellations flew, In patterns by their God designed, Vermilion, opal, emerald, blue; And Jesus, marvelling, lagged behind. The Father, silent in His grief, Swept ever onward into space, Devising, for the world's relief, The crown of thorn, the cross of grace. So deep His thought of human weal, Of Paradise by sin defiled, The Lord and Maker did not feel His wing no longer roofed the child. But when He knew His son was gone, He turned Him round, and bent His eyes To where the boy in beauty shone Amid the splendour of the skies. God bridged the distance by a look, Till, dazzled by the glorious beam, The eyelids of the Saviour shook As though they fluttered in a dream. Waving a hand to deer that fed, Upon a moon, beside a spring, Along the road of light he sped, And brushed against his Father's wing. That anxious look for ever kept A strip of heaven as white as may: Where tides of love immortal swept We point our sons the Milky Way. A PREFERENCE At Tewkesbury and at Westminster, At many a holy resting-place, My kindred glorified the air With abbeys rich in votive grace. Triumphantly they spread the roof Above the aisles below their feet, And firmly, with laborious power, Upreared the monumental tower For Faith to hold, for Time to cheat. At Errington and Underhill, At many a bird-contenting place, The chaffinches, with toe and bill, As Spring advises, work apace. Cathedrals? How are they to match The roofless abbey in the thorn, That swiftly, with instructed power, The quiet masons hour by hour Erect, to prove that love is born? LESSONS “'Tis hard to be prevented,” I heard a flower exclaim, “From being sweetly scented, Like others I could name!” But humble little flowers That haven't any smell Are safer in their bowers Than violets in a dell. “I'd change this very minute,” I heard a sparrow say, “My clothes, and be a linnet, If I could have my way.” But birds too finely crested, Too smart in wing or tail, Are frequently arrested And hurried off to jail. “Why haven't we between us A share of lovely light? I want to join you, Venus,” Said Earth, “in being bright.” But devotees of duty Are often not aware How glorious is the beauty Their honest faces bear. THE LOVER'S WISH All that by day was glad to shield Thy sweetness now is put aside, And, only to the dark revealed, Thou prayest to be sanctified. Sundered by walls more hard than rock, Arrows of absence must I bear Till, by the heart's familiar shock, I know thy foot is on the stair. While thou art sleeping in the lawn Unworthy of so bright a guest, Dream gently onward till the dawn By breathing near thee breaks thy rest; And if within the dream there stands A lover marvelling at thy grace, Be mine the trembling of his hands, And mine the worship on his face. THWARTED “What is this man to you? A dwarf beneath a giant's thumb, He wriggles for his heart. You come, As sourly as you came before, And rob me at my very door. What is this man to you?” Said Death. “You shall not have him yet. He neither frowned nor bid me pay For bruised and broken yesterday, But gardened in his pleasant soul And offered me a buttonhole. You shall not have him yet!” Said Life. RESPONSES Are you happy in the sun, Dusting partridge? There's the gun. Are you happy in the brook, Dace and gudgeon? There's the hook. Are you happy in the oats, Nimble rabbit? There are stoats. Do you suffer any shocks, Gawky gosling? There's the fox. Does your heart go pit-a-pat, Grey-silk mousie? There's the cat. Is your heart a pulse of joy, Dapper hedgebird? There's the boy. Are you happy in God's plan, Subtle woman? There is man. Did I hear you catch your breath, Sinewy Cæsar? There is death. A CHRISTMAS HYMN 'Tis very strange that we should wait So self-contented for the time When belfries, throbbing and elate, Announce the dearest Christmas-chime; Should rarely count ourselves as dead, By wasted treasure, secret shame, By things not done, by words not said, With fearlessness in Jesu's name. Let us prepare to rise and sing, As new-born subjects, to our new-born King!” For it is wrong in us to live The foes of others gone astray, Perchance refusing to forgive Their sin, though sinning it to-day; Leaving the brightness for the dark, Knowing our shames, yet hugging them; Nearer to Judas than to Mark, And out of chime with Bethlehem. Let us prepare to rise and sing, As new-born subjects, to our new-born King! Who die to sin throughout the year, Removing many a scarlet stain, By dying thus are drawing near To birth in Jesus Christ again. Through every death, through every birth, They grow disciples of the Way, And yearly give a holier earth To Christ the Lord on Christmas Day. Let us prepare to rise and sing, As new-born subjects, to our new-born King! THE STRICKEN WOOD Hast thou been visited by Death? How still Thy voiceless congregation on the hill! What of the dove? the squirrel? and thy vows Of faith in change, expressed by falling boughs? If but one syllable of song were heard, If but the treading of a rabbit chanced, If but a hedgehog in the bracken stirred, I might believe this wood were not entranced. My heart, as though commanding such an hour As long had been denied, increases power, And, mastering me, till apprehension speaks In every vein, and reddens in my cheeks, So thunders on the anvil of my breast That I would have thy thousand oaks belong To windy harpers tuning crest and crest, And forcing every branch of thine to song. How strangely sounds, above the clamorous beat, The first and feeble trumpet of defeat! How swiftly throng within the park of sense The shapes of murders done amid a dense Assembly of dishonoured trees! There slips From out the northern edging of the wood The stealthy image that for ever drips, For ever threatens us, with murdered blood. A thousand harps, yet not a raptured string! Such silence, that a drift of air might bring The spoken fondness of a scarlet mouth That names me in the woodlands of the South! Pigeons and throstles somehow daunted there, Resist the trance! Deliver Joy, and send Consoling remedies along the air To heal the dumbness of your stricken friend! PARTNERS The Black Notes said to the White, “He will come to-night With his moody heart, and play As yesterday.” The White Notes answered, “Yes. When in keen distress He returns to you and me For sympathy. We know, as the woodland doves, Of the girl he loves In his moody heart, and share Her breast and hair.” The Black Notes said to the White, “When he comes to-night We will tell him how she crept To us and wept.” THE TOWN When I have to wander London As an exile for a season From the mistlethrush's solo, That is madness born of reason, How I long to hear him coaxing The attractive little lady He desires to share his fortune In the oaklands green and shady! Were it not that gentle Fancy Gives me glimpses of the bounty Spread for all whose eyes and bosoms Deeply love a wildrose county, Hardly could I bear the roaring Of the traffic, and the faces Of the greedy thousands pushing Even kinsmen from their places. Let me stand in adoration Very near the simple altar Of the country god who teaches All the song my lips can falter. In the town my secret Angel Frets me constantly by reaching Ever backward to the greenwood That my heart is now beseeching. THE DISGUSTED ROBIN Having finished a song for the girl of my heart, I had flung myself down on the toes of a pine And was humming the words, by the help of a tune That could marry them prettily, line after line. I was happy in thinking the place was my own, When the rudest of robins cried, “Fiddle-de-dee! What a negative squib of a lover you are! What contemptible cowardice! Listen to me!” While I flushed with annoyance, I gazed at the bough Where my critic was airing his apple-round breast And was vaunting such eloquent phrases as seemed To be shot by a gun from his resolute chest. “Now I swear, by the shape of Robina,” he cried, “That before I would father, and give to a lass, Such an addled and valueless jingle as that I would beg to be changed from a bird to an ass! “If a poet believes he was born to salute Every grace of his darling in metre and rhyme, Let him go for a series of lessons in pluck To the tit on a currant, the finch on a lime. As a verseman but lately received in a shire That is sunny and candid, your task is to learn An imperative ruling, wise, simple, and brief: Hold your tongue, if a coward; sing fire, if you burn. “Near the belt of young larches in front, on the right, There's a dear woman coming, as happy and sweet As a dewdrop that lives half a day with a rose, And there's love in the sound of her heather-kissed feet. Do you dare to pretend that your tape-measured song Has the requisite valour and spirit and rush? There's a rabbit-hole yonder. Now, run to her lips! Show her all that she is and compel her to blush!” TWO SLAVES Had I the old Enchanted Lamp To rub, that, towering in my view, Its Slave along the air might spread His limbs and rear aloft his head Within a frame of gold and blue, My starving breast would have him speed, With haste as violent as my need, To bring me, Fairest, you. But then—your panting loveliness Within his arms! Were he as true As angels, what a raging test Of honour startled in a breast Where pain and passion both were new! Slave of the Slave, I could not dare To send him lonely. He should bear Your worshipper to you. THE BARRIER Stay! We have gone as far as we can go. The rest is wisdom not for us to know, And here we stand, as travellers refused A welcome after courage fiercely used Across the world, across the deeps of space, By pilgrims searching for the Holy Face That will not suffer us till we have shed Mortality, and risen from the dead. Give me your hand. Our wayfaring is done, Beyond the flashing of the farthest sun. There would not be this barrier set to pride Were glory absent on the other side And beauty worth concealing till the hour When darkness changes to a sudden flower As white as snowdrop, and till crags that stand In front of us are level with the land. The wall of gateless rock is not the end. The rosebud lives beyond the rampart, Friend, And Love, with leaping pulses, gentle hands, Runs, as a brook of life, toward the bands Of dazzled travellers seeming in a trance Because of such a fair inheritance. Then Love will kiss them all, and teach them how To name the fruit, the flower, the bird, the bough; And, after many lessons day by day, As startling proof of how the Heavenly Way Was thorned and flinted to the sound of mirth By love-resisting revellers on Earth, Will bid them journey forward with their load Of shame and penitence along the road By which will come to them at eventide The Shepherd whom they daily crucified. If you and I accept this end of thought; Turn back together; labour as we ought, Believing that the flower of Vision grows Behind the barrier, as on Earth the rose, No longer shall we miss the dignity of torn And crippled hands among the flint and thorn, But, spending Talents thus for Him above, Retire from musing and advance to love. Withdrawn, and motionless as silent trees, Amid a tangle of immensities, Together, Comrade, we forgot the sign Of him who gave the wounded oil and wine And substance for the morrow. Let the clear Announcement of the Cross, that we are here For sacrifice, as long ago our Lord, Enrol two labourers heedless of reward. HONESTY Love-struck throstle in the pine, With a clearer voice than mine, You are not a smooth and grave Time-defeated slave. Splendid! Sing for me again Honest elemental pain. Let a roadside pupil learn How you dare to burn. Feathered scholar of the wild, Nature's unaffected child, Man, within his hand a rod, Itched to be a god. Thus he fell by rising. Health, Truth and Peace were sold for Wealth. Marketing, he glibly priced Cattle, corn, and Christ. When he hears, as I hear now, Radiant truth upon a bough, Let him count himself a grave Time-defeated slave. FORERUNNERS The Snowdrop founded cities Ere Adam learned to spread His grains of wheat upon a stone And powder them for bread. Though man is wont to flourish The marvels he has done, The Snowdrop worked before him, And will work when he is gone. A million years the Nettle Had lived beneath the sky Before she got a chance to sting Eve's leg and make her cry. Though woman soon developed A weapon she could trust, The Nettle stung before her, And will sting when she is dust. THE QUESTIONS The time must come for me to spill At last the vivifying cup; Forget the ledger and the till, Since Death has put my shutters up. 'Tis written. I must fall, and be Creation's newly-broken toy. Has God another shop for me? And shall I start as errand-boy? THE WAIF The unseen wings that brought him here Have wafted far away The child too delicate to bear On earth a longer stay. I often marvel how he chanced The broad blue road to miss, Wavered, forgot his world, and glanced Mistakenly to this. Perhaps the road was very long, The wings were very tired; Perhaps the call of evensong By many birds was quired So sweetly that the little breast Was tempted by a world Alive with tune, where heart could rest And jaded wings be furled. Two years he rested, well content With what my hands could give In love and labour fiercely spent To help the child to live. Love as we will, the skies re-take A truant of the skies, Though hearts that fed the wanderer break To have it otherwise. As often as I watch the boys Entrusted to my care, To whom the oak and elm are toys, The stream a jump to dare, I love to think my frailer son, Now suited by his place, Is quick to climb, alert to run, And bonny-brown of face. Since there was need for him to know On earth a human nest, How glad I am he did not go Beyond my willing breast! How glad to think the very skies That lost him for a while Are keeping for his mother's eyes That unforgotten smile! WARNING Still I believe in Song That's clear, and not too long, Though others tell me length Of versemanship is strength. Were it the blackbird's fate To sing from eight till eight, He might not have a nook In Palgrave's Golden Book. Herrick, whose shorter breath Than Milton's conquered death, Is far more often pressed In joy against a breast Than he who lost his way In Paradise, men say, And left no comrade song To help the world along. Remember, you that try To reach the singing sky And gleam as stars above The generation's love, How deathless is the strength Of Beauty's little length, That Time has picked to be The heart's anthology. ANSWERED “Now that I see With clearness what my life should be, Great Master, shall I walk along with Thee?” “Not so, my friend. Thou hast my heart and soul to spend Elsewhere. But I will meet thee at the end.”</field>
