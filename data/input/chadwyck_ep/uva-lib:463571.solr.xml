      <field name="fulltext">Englands Iubile: Or, A Poem on the happy return of his Sacred Majesty, Charls the II. To the Kings most Sacred Majesty, Pardon great Prince, for all our offering here, But weak discoveries of our wants appear No language is Commensurate with thee, Our loftiest flights but plain Humilitie. Yet since we may, our frailty to conceale, Be guilty of a Crime in smoothering zeale, That bids thy blest returns more welcome then Plenty to th'starv'd, or land to shipwrackt men. For such were we, or if there's ought can more Demonstrate ill, that wo was ours before. Heaven, to restore our lost light sent us him, Without whose raise our sphear had still been dim: Dim as in that dark intervall, when we Saw nothing but the Clouds of Anarchie, Raised by the Witch-craft of Rebellion, to So vast a height, none durst pretend to view, Whilest they lay Curtain'd in that black disguise, Majestick beams, but twas with blood-shot eyes. Then if such of necessity must pine, Who're rob'd of food, both humane and divine; How could we thrive, when those that did pretend To feed, did all on their Ambition spend. Who with the Sword, not Reason did Convince, And rackt the Subiect to unthron the Prince. The dolefull years of thy exile have been At once our Nations punishment and sin: Tost in a storm of dark Afflictions, we Floated at randome, yet still look'd on thee As our safe Harbour, but had none to guide Us root-False Pilates with the windes complide We saw what Crime drench'd the amazed rout; Yet wanted strength to cast that curst thing out Though oft twas vainlie strugl'd for, yet we Who were exil'd from nought but Libertie: Who durst live hear Spectators of those times, Do now in tears repent our passive Crimes, And with one Universall voice allow We all deserve death, since we live till now. But this is Englands Jubilee, nor must Thy Friends doubt mercy, where thy foes dare trust. Thou art our great Panpharmacon, which by Its vertue cures each various malladie, Giving their pride, a ccole alay of fears, Whilest to restore our Hectick, hope appears: And these began the Cure, which to compleat, Expansive mercy makes thy thron her seat: So that there now (except the guilt within) No signe remains, there hath a difference been. The giddy rout, who in their first Addresse, Cryed Liberty, but meant licentiousness, Whose deprav'd judgements, nor content to see A heaven of Stars, their primum mobile Did Change the systeme; and ith' spight oth' love Or feare of heaven, taught earths base dregs to move, In the bright Orb of honour, where to all That's great, or good they were excentricall: Having long found their direfull influence In nought but plagues descended; did from thence Learn sad repentant Lectures, and dare now Present the Sword, where late the knee did bow. Dare tell their damb'd impostors they but made False zeale the light, whilest treason cast the shade. Dare Curse their new discoveries, which plac't in Hels Geographie, Amerricaes of sin. But these, like dust rais'd 'twixt two Armies, doe Hurt, or assist, as they are hurried to Either by levity; And therefore must By none be held an Object of their Trust; For though they are Usurpers hands, they've found They rent at night, what they ith' morning crown'd; But you (great Sir) whose fate hath been so mixt, As to behold these vollatile, and fixt, May (since the off-spring of their sufferings) be More certain of their future Loyaltie. And though your title, and heaven setled state Needs not (Usurper like) measure your Fate By such vain love, yet may you still be sure They'le neer again, a Rebbels scourge endure. These past years of infatuation, which Hath drayn'd their Coffers, did their hearts enrich, With so much eager loyalty, that when With wonder, like those new recover'd men, Who by our Saviours miracles escaped From darknesse thought men had like trees been shaped They onely through mist rarrified, gazed at Those glimmering beams, whilest they knew not what Th'event would be, how (wing'd with hope) did they Each feeble glance praise as approaching day. But when, with such advantage as the light Gains by succeeding the black dresse of night. Through all the fogs of their preceeding fear, They from the North saw loyall Monk appear: How in Petitions did their Prayers exhale, To waft him on, untill the gentle gale (Although by wayes so wisely intricate; They rais'd our fear, whilest they did calm our fate, Brought him at length through all our doubts to be, The great Assertor of our Libertie. Then did we think that modest blush but just, Whose present die, display'd our late mistrust. And to requite those injuries wee'd done To myriads rais'd, what single praise begun: Through all the devious paths which he did tread, From the base Rump, unto the glorious Head: We scand his Actions, which did nought comprise That might offend, but that he was too wise For Vulgar iudgments, whose weak fancies guest By present Actions, what would be the rest. But when their eyes unvail'd, discover'd who Had to destroy the monster, found the Clew. How did they praise his Wisdome, Valour, all That could within the name of subject fall: And to compleat, what ere his due might be, Knit up those Lawrels with his Loyalty; That noble Vertue, without which the rest Had onely burthend, not adorn'd his Crest. Then, since we now by this heaven guided hand, Once more behold the glory of our land; Whom midnight plots long studied to exclude Again fixt in's Meridian Altitude: Lets cease to mourn, and whilest those fogs attend Such miscreant wretches, as dare still offend, By flying mercy, raise our souls, deprest Ere since this Star set in the gloomy West. For then begun that dreadfull night, which we Have since with terrour seen, brave loyalty Being so opprest by a prevailing fate; Twas onely-known by being unfortunate: Yet, though Rebellion in unnaturall Wars, So far did thrive, to prove us falling Stars. The wiser world saw those that did aspire, Not as Heavens lamps, but Hels impetuous fire. As monsters of Ambition, such whose wilde Chymera's since Rebellion first defiled Our English Annals, onely were advanc'd: But fortunes light Ephemera's, to be glanc'd A while with secret envy on; and then Hurld from th'ill mannaged helm, to be by men persude with such a just deserved hate, As makes each curse, ad weights unto their fate: Horrid as are their names, which neer shall be Mention'd without adjuncts of Infamy: So full of guilt, all Ages to insue Shall weep to hear, what this neere blusht to doe. Whilest we were in these uncoutch shades o'recast To tell what wilde Meanders hath been past By thee, our Royall Soveraign, is a Task That would the tongues of inspired Angels ask. Yet since domestick miseries hath taught Us part of the sad stories ruder draught We may, by weak reflection come to see, With what dire waight these dark storms fell on thee; Who, whilest thou didst (from hence excluded) stand The pittied wonder of each Forraign Land: Learnd'st by commanding Passions how to sway A Nation more rebellious far than they; So that the Schoole which thou wert tutor'd in, Though thy disease, our Antidote hath been We suffering not our Crimes desert, because From hence you learn'd to pitty, and the Laws Just harnesse with such Candor mitigate, As once you bore the rigour of your Fate. (What earthquakes breeds it in our breasts, when we But think o're thy progressive miserie: How thou (our restlesse Dove) seeing no mark Of land, wert hurried from our floating Arke: (And whilest those Villaines, that exposed thee lay Forc't every winde of Faction to obey) Wert long with billows of Affliction beat, Ere thou didst with thy Olive branch retreat. How by poore Friends, and powerfull Enemies, By Flattering strangers, and by false Alies, Were thy Afflictions varied, for all these Shared in the complicating thy disease Like dolefull Mourners that surround the bed Of a departing Friend, those few that fled Hence on the wings of Loyalty, to be Partakers of what e're attended thee; Whilest they did mourn, but could not lend relief: Did by their sorrow but increase thy grief. Such was the power of thy prevailing foes; No place afforded safety, some of those Whom poverty sent to attend thy Train, To cure that mallady, did entertain Infectious Councels, which did festering lye Till Rebels Gold outweighed their Loyalty. And from the black pernicious Embrio bred, Monsters whose hands strove to destroy their Head. Nor, whilst these secret sorrows sunk a mine, Which if not hinderd by a power Divine Had blown up all thy patience, wert thou free From publick injuries, that amities Which former leagues, or the more sacred ties Of blood could claim, vail'd in the base disguise. Of pollicy starts back, and doth give way For treason to expell, or else betray. Great birth, and vertues which did that excell As the meridian doth each paralell, Are but weak props, a Rebels threats convince: And all avoid a persecuted Prince. When after these big storms of ill abroad, Some loyall Subjects had prepar'd the road Unto thy throne, and thou didst once more hear Arm'd for redemption of thy Crown appear, Whilest all our hearts, whose distant hands could not Come to assist, thy righteous cause waxt hot With loyall hopes: how were we plannet strook, When fortune, with pretended friends forsook Thy side, at fatall Worcester, and to raise A Rebels Trophies, rob'd thee of thy bayes. How dismal sad, how gloomy was each thought Of thy obedient Subjects whilest they sought Their flying Soveraign, curtain'd from their eys, In the dark dresse of an unsafe disguise. All wisht to know, what all desire should be A secret kept, such strange varietie Of contradictions did our passions twist: We would behold the Sun, yet prais'd the mist. But whilest desire thus shot at rovers, that More powerfull Sacrifice our prayers, being at Heavens penetrated eare directed, found Our hopes by thy diserting us nere Crown. For though to want thee was our great'st distresse; Yet now thy Absence was our happinesse. Then; though we neer enough can celebrate The praise of this, yet thy misterious fate (Great favourite of Heaven) so often hath Advanc'd our wonder, that the long trod path Directs us now without more guides to see, Those miracles, wrought in preserving thee Were Gods imediate Acts, to whose intents Were often fitted weakest instruments, From whose successe faith this impression bore, He that preserv'd thee, would at length restore, Which now through such a laborinth is done, We see the end, ere know how 'twas begun: That big bulkt cloude of poysonous vapors, in Whose dismall shades, our Liberty had been Long in amaze of errours lost, was by A wholesome Northern gale inforc'd to flye Easie as morning mists, so that the fate Seem'd not more strange, which did at first create, Then what did now destroy in it, did appear As far from hope, as was the first from fear: When a Rebellious tyranny had been So strengthen'd by a prosperous groweth in sin, That the contagious leprosie had left None sound, but what were honest by their theft. Then to behold that Hydra, which had bred So many, in an instant, her last head Submit to justice, is a blessing we Must praise ith' raptures of an extasie, Till from the pleasing trance, being welcom'd by Loud acclamations, raised from Loyalty: We come, we come, with all the reverence due To heavens bests gifts (great Prince) to welcome you: You who by suffering in a righteous Cause Safely restored, that Liberty, those Laws, Which after long Convulsive Fits were now Expiring, so, that future times told how This great work was perform'd, shall wonder most To see the Feaver Cur'd, yet no blood lost. But those are Mercies fit to Usher in Him to a Thron, whose vertuous life hath been Beyond detraction good; therefore attend Those joyes which Heaven to us, by you, did send: Whose sacred essence waighted on by all, The most transcendent blessings that can fall Within the Sphear of humane vertue, still Surround your Throne; may all imagin'd ill Die in the Embrio; may no dark disguise Of seeming Friends, or Foes that temporise E're prejudice your peace, may your Foes prove All blushing Converts; may all those that love You do't for zeal, not gain; and though that we (What was of late your mark) our povertie Are still inforc'd to wear, oh may there thence Ne're spring a thought to take or give offence: May all toward you be fraughted with desires, That may in flaming zeal out blaze the fires, That you were welcom'd in with: May delight Within your Royall breast no opposite E're finde, but so let gentle pleasure grow, That it may kiss the banks, but neer overflow. When Hymen leads you to the Temple, let It be to take that Jem, which heaven hath set The worlds adorning ornament, that we May by that blest Conjunctions influence see Such hopefull fruit spring from our Royall stem, As may deserve the whole worlds Diadem. May Peace adorn your Thron; yet if the Sword Must needs be drawn may it no sound afford But Victory, untill extended Power Adds waight unto your Scepter: May no houre Ere set a seal to the Records of time, But what still makes your pleasure more sublime, Till they being grown to pure for earth, shall be Call'd to the Triumphs of Eternitie.
