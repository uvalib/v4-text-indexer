      <field name="fulltext">To his Translation. Go little eccho of anothers voice, Tell in thy mother tongue a strangers mind. And when thou com'st abroade, and findest choise Of readers differing in their various kind, Reeccho backe vnto the gentle spirit, Such thankes as his iudicious skill shall merit. But if thou meete with any dunsing Iauell, That is an homager to ignorance, And yet doth enuiously presume to cauill, And blunder out such words as these by chance: That he sees not how Bartas doth surpasse, Diuide his word, and turne him backe the Asse. To the Translator. Heauen, Labour, Art, all ioyntly did conspire To crowne thy verse with neuer-fading bayes: First Gods sweete breath did teach thy Muse t'aspire To caroll out Lord Bartas heauenly layes. Then thy high thoughts to second this rare choise, Droue forth with matchlesse paines thy great intent: And last to sing Gods notes with Angels voice, Art did consort to make a full concent. Great choise, great paines, great art, all good, all great, All three thy litle booke do greatly praise: Why striue I then in Honours chaire to seate Thy Muse, which of it selfe, it selfe can raise? O then braue impe of Phœbus still pursue Thy great deseigne, aduance thy Poetrie: Let enuious France by reading find this true, That Bartas scornes not our rich liuerie. Then shall the French an English wonder see, How Winter yeelds a spring of Poesie. Douglas Castillion. Iohn Dauies of Hereford in praise of the Author, and Translator. Winter, a man would thinke thy works are cold, That did but heare thy name, or know thy kind, But yet such heate this worke of thine doth hold, As in a Sommers day we scarce shall find Among our hote-brain'd Poets. Thou hast hit Vpon that heate (though with another fire) That did enflame the rarest Poets wit, That ere in France (worlds garden) did respire. Bartas, the bosome of whose blessed Muse With Homers sacred fire (refin'd) did burne: Did (as should seeme) into thy breast infuse That fire by touching him; for thou dost turne His heate to thine, and thine to his, if so Both in this Tract translated thou dost show. His opinion Touching translators, and translation. To turne one tongue t'another is a tricke That many tongues-men can in prose performe; But when the tongues on numbred feete do sticke, It's hard two tongues discordant to conforme. Who word for word, and phrase for phrase translates In verse, may vaunt he earnes his Authors fame: But, but few tongues are tyde t'our English pates, That can with ease directly do the same. Many translators haue we, but not many That turne not th'Authors meaning with his words. Famous were England if she had not any, That to them selues such libertie affords. To translate so, is to adulterate: And all Adulterers God and men do hate. Omne bonum, Dei donum. The second day of the first Weeke of the Lord Bartas. The Argument. Ovr Poet intending a Discourse of the worlds creation, and hauing in the first day of this Weeke indiciously declared that the world had a beginning, against the absurd paradoxes of some doting philosophers, which held that it was from all eternity: and hauing both taxed and answered their atheisticall curiositie, which busie their idle and addle brains, about enquiring what God did before the creation: prouing also that there can be but one world, and confuting diuerse other errors of the ancients: sheweth, that God first made some confused matter or Chaos, of which he afterward framed the particular parts of the whole body of this world. And then shortly and sweetly discoursing of the light, the day and the night, with the singular commodities redounding to m?kind by their successiue reuolutions, he ends that booke with the creation of the Angels. All which being learnedly perfourmed, he addresseth himselfe in this second booke to the deciphering of the second dayes creation. Wherein first he layeth open the vanitie of the lasciuious and wenching pamphleters of our age, which prodigally spend their precious time, in adorning some degenerate imps, or loose-liuing Lady with those honors, which should be onely confined to vertuous designements. Then he inuoketh the assistance of Gods spirite, and briefly proposing his chast intention, fals directly to the handling of the elements, their number and composition in mixt bodies; of the commoditie and inconuenience of their agreeing or disagreeing proportions in mans bodie: then reasoning of their continuance, he refutes diuerse errors touching the generation, corruption and alteration of things in their matter and forme. After, breathing a while, he enters a discourse of the Aire, shewing how it is deuided, what the temperature of each region is, with the causes of the same: and how the mists, the blasts, the clouds, the deaw, the yce and other waterie meteors are ingendred: and consequently intreateth of the falling starres, and comets, with the rest of the fiery impressions which are often seene in the two extreme regions of the aire. Hereunto he adioyneth a philosophicall narration of the thunder and lightning, touching in briefe their strange yet certaine effects; not omitting, for the more absolute complement of his discourse, to assigne probable reasons of the raine-bow, the circles about the Sunne and Moone, and the many Sunnes and Moones, which affright the ignorant with their appearance. But albeit he shewes himself a Philosopher in producing these naturall reasons, yet he would haue euery man to shew himselfe a Christian, in not wholy resting satisfied with these second causes; but euer so to acknowledge the wisedome of the Almighty, that he rather admire the creator, then adore the creature: adding thereunto the religious vse, which Christians should make of these impressions and prodigious signes. And that he may clip the wings of mans pride, which is wont to soare beyond it selfe in self-conceits, he demonstrates how it is impossible for the most cunning naturalist, to render sound reasons of all accidents. Then leauing the aire, he ouerthrowes their opinion which hold but three elements, and shewes the difference between that elementarie and our compounded fire; adioyning therunto a briefe treatise of the matter, the motion and number of the celestial spheares. And answering those which are of opinion, that there are no waters aboue the firmament, he assumes a fit occasion to mention the generall floud; with an elegant description whereof he ends this second dayes worke. All which excellent points he adornes with such pleasant illustrations, that Omne tulit punctum, qui miscuit vtile dulci. Those Learned wits, whose soothing rimes do change The vanity of lasciuious Poets. Fowle into faire, and lewd with chast do range, And of a bastard, dwarfe, blind, flirting boy Do make a god, nay all the gods to sway: They lose both seed and trauell of their hand, In plowing of th'vngratefull fruitlesse sand. And setting nets for to intrap the winde Of some vaine praise, which doth their wisedome blinde, They imitate the Spiders curious paine, Which weaues a needlesse web withouten gaine. But though more deare then time we nought possesse, Yet would I grieue their losse of that the lesse, If by their guilefull verse their too much Art Made not their hearers share with them a part. The sugred baite of those their learned writs, Doth shrowd that poison, which the yonger wits Quaffe downe with breathlesse draughts, and loues hote wine, Making them host at drunken Bacchus signe, Distempers so their stomacks, that they feede On such ill meats as no good humours breede. Their charming numbers with a mightie glaunce, Cast headlong downe fresh readers to mischaunce. Which by a vaine desire soone make them slide, From this liues mountaine, where they might abide. The songs to which their Muse sweete notes doth frame, Are bellowes of lewd lust, which do enflame That wanton heate, which yet yong tender age, In modest ashes keepes in vassallage. The chast int?tion of the L. Bartas.Now all such as I am, I haue deuoted That art and wit which heauen hath me allotted, To th'honor of great Ioue, such verse to frame, As virgins reading need not blush for shame. Inuocatio.Thou Learnings spring, soule of this worldly round, Sith thou wilt haue my low-tun'd verse to sound Of thy great praise, graunt that my keaking quill, Celestiall Nectar euer may distill: And fill this volume with her hornes store, Which cherisht once a god then late ybore. That in some rate it may be correspondent, To the greatnesse of so graue an argument. Rid cleane the path, which now I am to tread, From bushie brakes which do it ouer-spread. Throughout my course so lend me still thy light, That to my Inne I may arriue ere night. The chaos created of nothingThat endlesse end, broade length and height profound, Which yet no world, yet was a worldly round: That massie lumpe which nourisht ciuill hatred, Was instantly of verie nought created: And was that fertile soile from which should grow Earth, water, aire, the fire, and heauen also. The compositi? of the foure elements in mixt bodies.Now these foure brethren two-twind generation, Thus made, not onely keepe their seuerall station, But are the simples too, to make the mixt Of euery thing, whereon our sense is fixt. Whether their onely qualities remaine, And in each part of each mixt bodie raigne: Or their essentiall formes be all combined, These foure as one sole bodie are defined. Simile.As in a chrystall glasse we see the bloud Of grapes, allaide with Achelous floud. Or as the meate and drinke, which we haue singled Out for our nouriture, in vs is mingled, And by our inward heate yeelds moisture, good To be conuerted into purest bloud. This in a burning brand we see full plaine, Example. His fire towers vp, his heauenly home t'attaine, His aire to smoake, his earth to ashes goeth, Out of his knobs the boiling water floweth. Like warre our bodies quiet peace maintaineth: For fire and aire in vitall spirits remaineth, The flesh is earth, the humors water be. Yea in each particle we plainely see Each of these mingled, though some ones minority, Among his brethren beares not like authority. So in the bloud, those muddie lees which craue (As being earthie) lowest place to haue, Are melancholy; in the middle swimmes The purest bloud like aire; about the brimmes Lies watrie phlegme; and on the top there bubbles That firie choler which so many troubles. Yet in the bodie no one element One element alvvayes predominant in mixt bodies. Doth daily play the king, but is content To take his turne, and so his subiects awes, As if they take new Lord, he makes new lawes. As each good townse-man bloud or wealth nought heeding, Simile. Is rul'd, which earst in ruling made proceeding In a free citie, which doth lose his fashion, Soone as the rulers suffer alteration. For the light vulgar tost with euerie wind, Are to their princes humors still enclind Cameleon-like, which change of colours weareth, Example. As oft as change of obiect him anneareth. So th'element of which wine most partaketh, Now moist, now dry, now hote, now cold it maketh. And as these foure are coupled more or lesse, So do th'effects and tast the same expresse: So that in time the iuyce of grapes vnripe, Becomes new wine to fill the emptie pipe; And that same new growes good as it growes old. Which kept too long, for vineger is sold. Any element excessiuely predominant, is dangerous to the bodie.Now whiles the Prince which keepes the rest in aw, Doth subiugate his greatnesse to the law; He rules in safetie and doth still increase, His commons ioy for their so happie peace. But if of subiects bloud which he doth spill By dint of sword, he neuer take his fill, At length his rage dispeopling so his land, Must leaue his realme to sauage beasts command. Right so as long as some one element, Doth rule the rest with modest gouernment; And a proportion in the humors found, Though some do more then other some abound, The bodie's in faire plight, as those faire lines, Drawne on the surface, are thereof good signes. Caligula.But if that cruell king it represent, Who wisht that all of his great regiment, Had one sole necke, that at one chop he might Butcher all Rome in furious despight: Then doth it breed corruption of the rest, And th'house whereof the tyrant is possest, Doth by degrees decay; so that the eye The bodies totall change may soone descrie. Excesse of moisture causeth the dropsie.So whensoere the liuer is opprest With moisture, which it cannot well digest, Which runs along the flesh, it makes it swell, And stops the conduit pipes which should expell Moist excrements, and bolteth fast the dore, Which to the panting breath should euermore Yeeld backe; and in the water doth torment The dropsie-sicke with thirstie languishment. Nor doth it leaue the patient any rest, Vntill the graue be of his corps possest. Excesse of drinesse causeth the Hectique feuer.So, too much drought a lingring feuer breeds, Which with some paine on th' Hectique daily feedes; Feebles the sinewes, clads the heart with griefe, The face with sadnesse, playes the very thiefe, In stealing from the limmes their moist reliefe, Like as the flaming torch, which is the chiefe Cause of his peecemeale burning cleane away, Feeds by his life, liues by his owne decay. Nor doth it lend the patient any rest, Vntill the graue be of his corps possest. So too much heate doth breed the feauer lourdane, Excesse of heate the cause of the quartane ague. The tongne surcharging with a slimie burthen, And makes the drudging pulse to trot apace, And in the braine more diuerse shapes doth trace With a fantasticke pencill, then can art, Or chance, or Nature to the eye impart. Nor doth it lend the burning patient rest, Vntill the graue be of his corps possest. So too much cold vpon the aged pate Excesse of cold causeth old age. Doth clap a hoarie fleece, and doth abate The flesh, and furrowes vp the late-smooth forehead, Hollowes the eyes, and makes a man abhorred Vnto himselfe, and gliding through each part, Doth by his winters freeze the very heart. Nor doth it lend the aged any rest, Vntill the graue be of his corps possest. Yet thinke not that this great excesse doth bring Nibil in nibilicum riducitur. Annihilation vnto any thing: It onely doth diuersifie the fashion, So as the matter by this commutation, Do it within, or else without remaine, Nor can be sayd to lose, nor yet to gaine. What ere is made, is of that matter fram'd, Which in the ancient nought the Materia prima. First was nam'd. And whatsoeuer is resolu'd againe, Vnto that former matter runnes amaine. For since that God of nothing made this All, Ex nihilo nihil fit. Of nought is nothing made, nor euer shall Ought vnto nought be brought: but all that's borne, Or dyes againe doth onely change his forme. His bodie sometimes shrinkes, sometimes is lengthened, Sometimes is thickened, somtimes straightened. Ratio.And if (in sooth) of nothing bodies were, The earth vntild should fruit abundant beare; Desired children, virgins should enioy; And each thing grow each where without annoy; The thirstie hart should in the Ocean lie; The monstrous whale should dwell vpon the drie; The fleecie sheepe should grase amid the aire; The seruice tree, and eke the pine-tree faire, Should take their rooting in the raging floud; Out of the oke the ches-nut tree should bud; And from the ches nut tree should achornes fall; And natures lawes being violated all, The eagle with the silly doue should match, And each of these the others broode should hatch. Nothing can enlarge it selfe by it selfe.And if that bodies of themselues could grow, Then man which in his growing is so slow, Should instantly be of that very stature, Which in full age is giuen him by nature. Vnplanted trees with leauie branches dight, Should rob the shaded groues of Phœbus light. The suckling elephant his backe should yeeld, Vnto the warlike castle for the field. The yongling Colt couragiously should neigh, Bucephal-like in warre to breake the ray. Contrariwise, if ought annihild be, Then whatsoere we touch, or tast, or see, Still losing something of his quantitie, At length should come vnto a nullitie. If death could something to a nothing bring, Then should that change be vtter perishing. ExemplificatioSometimes the mountaines prouder tops do fall, But then the dales are filled therewithall. And when as Rhone, or Thesis swelling pride, Doth ouerflow the field through which they glide, No more on either side is drownd and lost, Then is recouerd on the other coast. The louely heauen doth showre downe many a floud, That his beloued spouse the earth may bud; Which she repaies squirting them vp amaine, Through hidden poares of hearbes and trees againe. He that this only obseruation makes, Simil. How waxe a hundred diuerse fashion takes, Yet still the same; to him the daily change Of this inferiour world cannot be strange. The worlds First matter is this waxe vnformed, Which with a thousand formes is all adorned; The forme is the seale, and heauens great King, Is this high Chancelor, who with his ring, His great or lesser seales doth print vpon her, Which sometime bring her shame, and somtimes honor. With vs is nothing firme and constant; here Both life and death in turne do dominere. One bodie springs not till another fade, Onely the matter is immortall made. Gods writing table, bodie of this All, Receiuer of what accidents befall; All like it selfe, all in it selfe compacted, It neither is enlarged nor contracted. Whose essence is vnchanged, but her shape No fewer outward fashions doth escape, Then Proteus, or the fish cald Manie-feete, Which for to prey amid the warrie deepe, Himselfe discolours, and in imitation Fitly resembles our French-neighbour nation, Materia prima Gallo similis. Which like an ape doth euermore delight, To be in stranger fashions alway dight: Whose shirt no oftner suffers any change, Then his apparell doth a fashion strange. This Matter is a Lais, whose delight Would chaunge a hundred louers in a night, Who scarcely of some yonkers arme vnlaced, Hath in her cogitation straight embraced Anothers culling, and her nouell sport, Doth cause her wish for plentie of that sort. For this same matter prickt with strong desire Of change: and yet vnable to attire Her selfe with euery shape, doth by succession Receiue in euery part a new impression. The cause of the transmutation of the elements.The chiefest cause of these euanishments, Is deadly fewd of our foure elements; Which in their turne do prey one on the other, As snow and water being maide and mother, Do make a mutuall change: each of these foure, In two chiefe qualities doth shew his powre; Whereof the one doth still the scepter sway, To whom the other doth his homage pay. Those elements whose forces disagree, And wholy sauour of antipathie, Maintaine a longer fight in open field, Or either of them to the other yeeld. The fire to water turnes not speedily, Nor doth the aire rauen so greedily Vpon the earth: for being deadly foes, They fight both with their fingers and their toes. But aire to water, earth to fire likewise Doth sooner turne; for that they symbolize Some qualitie: and easier tis to quell One enemie, then two that do rebell. Sith then this worlds children none can see, Vntill these elements conioyned be In holy wedlocke: and that nothing dies, Till by diuorce these foure are enemies; Which by vnconstant changing of their place, Produce those various formes, wherwith the face Of this great All is so embellished: Simil.(Iust as a song is sweetly relished With some few notes in sundrie line and space, Which by their charming, sweet, harmonious grace, Do make the hearers eares the broad high way, By which they may their soules from them conuey. Or as the letters of the Alphabet, Simil. By being in a diuerse order set, Do make these words; and then these words againe, Which here do flow from my poëtike braine, Changing their rancke, enrich these sacred lines, With choice of new discourse a thousand times.) It wants not reason: why Gods carefull hand, Sharing among them, all their common land, Gaue each a place fit for his quantitie, Which also might preserue his qualitie. He then that sees a drossie wedge of gold, Example. Maisterd by Uulcan, how it doth vnfold His wished riches, and how lingringly The gold vnto the gold doth striue to slie; The siluer seekes the siluer, and the brasse Betweene them both doth run, and how that masse Composd of peeces neither like his fellow, Doth branch it selfe in streames, blacke, white, and yellow: He doth conceiue that soone as God assigned A place, to which each one should be confined; The earth, the fire, the water, and the aire, Vnto their like do speedily repaire. So then this Chaos muddie lees do sinke The situation of the earth &amp; the fire. Right downeward by their naturall instinct. The fire doth trie a new conclusion, Runs through the chinkes of this Confusion, And sparkleth vpward by his nimble pace, And of this lower world gets highest place. As one may see when as the dawne doth paint Simil. The Zenith of Catay with colours quaint, Dead pooles to reake, and from the poarie ground, Exhaled vapours in the aire abound. The situation of the vvater and the aire.But least the fire which doth the rest inclose, Should burne the earth by his too neare repose, As arbiters betweene such deadly foes, Did God the water and the aire dispose, One of which two could neuer end their fight, The water parent-like would take delight To helpe the earth: the ayer would desire T'vphold the quarrell of his cousin fire. But both of them their sundred loue vniting, Might quickly end their quarrell and their fighting: Which questionlesse if't had not bene perfounned, This new-made world to his first state had turned. The aire is plac'd aboue, the water vnder, No chance, but God so placing them asunder, Who that each thing in other may take pleasure, Hath made his works in number, waight, and measure. For if neare Uulcan, Neptune had his place, That cholericke element would straight embrace Suspect of outrage, and his place forsake, That of his wrong some iudgement he might take. Now then the linkes of this most holy chaine, Which doth the members of this All containe, Are such as he alone can them vntie, Who linked them together cunningly. The water armd with moisture and with cold, Doth in one arme the cold-drie earth enfold, And in the other doth the aire embrace; The aire as hote and moist doth hie apace To ioyne himselfe by heate vnto the fire, And by his moisture water doth desire. Simil.As when the shepheardesses chaunce to meete, Trampling the flowers with their tripping feete, Marrying their pitches to the oaten sounds, And sportfully do daunce their rusticke rounds Vnder the branches of some shadie tree, By ioyning hand in hand so coupled be, As that the first clinching her fellow fast, Is ioyned by her fellowes to the last. For sith the earth alonely doth not nourish VVhy the earth is the center of the vvorld. Those creatures which in the same do flourish: But, which is more, doth with her dugs supply Foode to the winged people of the skie, And gluts the scaly troupe with longed food, Which cleaue the billowes of the briny floud, So that what ere doth creepe, runne, swimme or flie, Is by this Mother nourced carefully: It did behoue that she should counter-waigh Her selfe, that so she might the firmer stay Against the barking of the stormie maine, And might the anger-swollen cheekes disdaine Of Auster, who in parching heate delighteth, And Boreas, who with freezing cold still fighteth, It did behoue, her body dull and slow, Should farthest be from heauen here below, That she might nere be wheel'd about, by force Of heauens swift and neuer-resting course: Which doth with strong and stubborne rauishment, Pull round about the highest element. And sith againe that the harmonious course Of heauenly planets, is th'immortall source Of life in earthly things, and that their changing Is caused by the starres their circled ranging: Th'Almightie could no fitter lodge prouide, Whereas our grandame earth might well abide, Then in the center of this worldly round. For vitall beames wherewith the starres abound, Do shatter downe their powerfull influence Vpon the aire his waving residence, On th' arched fire, and on the swelling maine Where scaly people wanting lungs remaine. But they in fine vnite their forces all, Within the circle of this earthy ball, Simil.Which is the worlds naue: like as we may See in a wheele which chalketh out his way Amid the mudde; whose widest spoakes do meete Within the button by their ioyned feete. Simil.And as the Sunne doth pierce the window glasse, So do these starrie influences passe, Through euerie part without impediment Of the transparant firie element, The regions of the aire, and water bright, But not the earth, wherein is firmely pight The worlds foundation; so that we name, (And iustly too) the water, aire and flame, The concubines of euer-mouing heauen, For that his Sunne, and Moone, and Starry-seuen, Neuer inioy their loue, but when by chance By these three regions along they glance: When heauen husband-like hath no intent To be diuorc'd from the driest element: And with such seed as still doth animate Each liuing thing, he doth engrauidate The fruitfull earth his lawfull wedded bride; And with a bodie so diuersifide In disposition and in outward forme, He doth the structure of this All adorne. VVhy the vvater is placed betvveene the earth and the aire.The water lighter then the earthie lumpe, And heauier then the aire, doth pitch his iumpe Betweene them both; that being moist and cold, By those two qualities he may be bold, To slacke the thirstie drinesse of our Mother, And coole the feruor of his airie brother. Apostrophe ad Musam suam.But whither away my Muse? thou wanton stay, Spend not thy Poetry at one essay: Surcease to day, to sing of sea and land, Their compasse, power and praise, and where they stand. Do not too hastily preuent the time, Wherein the world was in his flowing prime: Leaue mountaine rockes with waters ouer-spread, Till Phœbus rise againe from's easterne bed: For when he shewes againe his blushing face, Then shall Gods powerfull hand asunder place These mingled bodies; and shall richly dight The earth, with bushie trees of goodly height. It's time my loue, my ioy and onely deare, To soare aloft, to lodge no longer here. Or neuer now tis time, to graft my wings On thy immortall virgin-pineonings; That on thy backe I being nimbly light, May safely vnto heauen take my flight. Come, come then luckily, thy shoulder lend, That mounted on the same I hence may wend To gaine that crowne, to win that wreathed bay, Which neuer Poets, that in Fraunce did sway, Did weare; and which the heauens nigardize Hath long concealed from my longing eyes. The aire (which foggie mists doth entertaine, The aire hovv and vvhy it is diuided into three regions. The play-game of the tempests and the raine; Th'inconstant house where winged clouds abide, Swift Æolus his kingdome and his pride. The shop where winds are sold, whose trafficke maketh, That euerie mouing thing of life partaketh) Is not all one, for men by learning guided, Into three lofts hau't rightfully deuided. Whereof the high'st (for that the restlesse course Regio suprema. Of the first Mouer puls it round by force, From East to West, and likewise from the West Vnto the place where faire Aurora's drest: And for it bounds vpon the burning flame) The learned do this loft the hottest name. That loft wherein we breath, by turne doth hold Regio infima. Now melting heate, now all-congealing cold: Now neither; so his waters in the Spring Are coldly hote; in Autumne wauering, In winter cold, and hote in sommers raigne, For then the earth rebateth backe againe Those beames, which starrie bow-men shoote apace; Especially the Sunne (the heauens chiefe grace) Who for his shafts doth euermore delight, To make the circled earth his but tand white. Media regio.The middle-loft, for that it still remaineth Farre from the burning seeling, which containeth This lower world in his firie seate, Vnable also to partake the heate, Which from the earth is banded bolt-vpright, Doth in continuall freezing take delight. For how could water hardned be to haile, Euen when the sommer heate doth so preuaile, That haruest fields looke white, if ycie cold His shiuering climates did not all enfold? VVhy the middle region is the coldest.Assoone as Phœbus hath his court remoued From the The signe Gemini. two twinnes, so mutually beloued, And takes his lodging with his Cancer. Crabbed hoste, Or panting Lyon; then this middle coast His cold redoubleth: for enuironed With heate of armies newly mustered, Which more then ere are now encouraged To haue his coldest times vnwintered: Delayes the time to traine his men no longer, His forces ioyn'd together are the stronger. Simil. As Christians leauing farre their natiue land, Feare not the furie of the Turkish band, Marching disorderly; make now and then, As many squadrons, as there be of men; So that sometime the clownes with bils and bowes, Driue them before them with their stubborne blowes: But when they see the Mooned flags appeare, (Armes of old Ottoman) and when they heare The horrid thunder of cannons sound, Which by their shocke do leuell with the ground, The strongest wals that euer yet immured Rhodes and Belgrada, while their prime indured, Straight they retire, and in some neighbour plaine, Do set themselues in order all againe; Their warlike courage doth increase their strength, Their bloud doth boile for heate, and at the length The bordring circumcised peoples aide Doubling their forces, makes their foes afraid. This antiperistasis (for tis no danger The effects of the Antiperistasis of the middle region. To naturalize a word that is a stranger, Yea in this worke, where we haue no one word, That doth so strong an emphasis afford) Doth cause that in the heate of winters cold, We feele the chimney hotter many-fold Then in the sommer: and that Scythia, Saluted often by Orithia Her blustering louer, euermore doth breed Children, whose stomackes crauing still to feed, Continually digest more store of meate, Both in the winter, and in sommers heate, Then those leane scranlings whom the Delphian torch, Vpon the Lybian sand doth alway scorch. This makes that we, which haue the happie lucke Sweete aire into our spongie lungs to sucke, More liuely heate within our stomackes hide, When freezing Ianiuere doth here abide: Then when the Sunne is banisht for a while From Chus, and to our tropicke doth recuile, Gods mightie hand did thus the aire deuide, That in the middle loft there might reside The mists, the comets and the windie traine, The tempests and the dew, the yce and raine. Some of the which appointed are to make The earth to yeeld her fruit, the rest to take Weapons against our sinnes: that so they might Engraue in hardest hearts each day and night, The awfull loue, the sweet-alluring feare Of him, which of this All the crowne doth weare. Simil.As in a cupping-glasse a litle flame, To shunne a vacuum (which is natures shame) Or of it selfe from cupped partes doth bring Th'abounding humor, which lies pestering The flesh; which being thinne and too subtile, Doth by the ruddie eyes distill each while: Right so the Sunne, whose yellow golden haire Doth daily guild this and that hemispheare, Two sorts of vapors euermore exhales From wauing fields, and from the flowrie dales. Exhalatio. Vapor.The one is thinne, pure, nimble, burning, dry, The other hote, moist, rising heauily, Which runne amid the aire throughout the yeare, And make the world vnlike it selfe appeare. Of the blasts, or mil devv.If then a vapor do so thinly rise, As that it cannot be in any wise To water turned; and his heauie wing Glued with cold, lie onely houering Vpon the earth his gaudy flowred weed, A blacknesse in the aire it straight doth breed, And therewithall a sluggish mistie blast, Vpon the hearbes and flowers hangeth fast. Of the devv and the yce.If so this vapor lingringly do flie Scarce to the middle region of the sky, Yet higher then the clouds, it's in a trice, In Aprill dew, in Ianuarie yce. Of the raine.But if this vapor actiuely do get, Vnto the shiuering winters cabinet; The water which hath got the highest place, Is turned in a verie litle space By cold into a cloud, and through the skie, Vpon the winged winds doth swiftly flie: Vntill his waters dropping downe amaine, Do find their grandame riuers once againe. Whether one cloud be driuen by the wind, Coniecturall reasons of the raine. Against another in a furious kind; And with a stubborne shocke are forc'd againe, To shed their water in a showre of raine: As oftentimes, a wanton lad doth dash Simil. The brittle vessels, seruing for to wash, Betweene his waggish hands, and so doth spill The water which the vessels earst did fill: Or whether it be, a gentler gale do play Amid the aire, and sighing in his way, Wrings out their teares: as after a great raine, Another showre stilleth downe againe From tops of forrests trees; when as the wind Among their bushy boughes doth pleasure find, And sports to crispe their wauing leauie tresses: Or whether it be a higher cloud that presses The vnder cloud with a moist heauie waight; And that the humor seekes an issue straight, Prest by another water: as is seene, The more that Grapes. Bacchus presents piled bene Vpon the hurdle in the vintage time, The faster doth the new, sweet, fuming wine Streame from the bottome pierced all below, And to the froathie tub amaine doth flow. Then many heauenly streames our flouds augment, Saue teares is nothing seene: the firmament Darkned with clouds, in drops doth seeme to still, And stinking frogs the earthie plaines to fill: Hovv frogs may be engendred vvith the raine. Whether the vapor that doth vpward flie, Be of it selfe both cold, hote, moist and drie; Whose mixture quickneth euerie liuing thing: Or whether it be, the Easterne blustering Sweeping the earth, do heape into the sky Some fertile dust, whereof confusedly These ougly things are made; as neare the brimme, Where some new mountaine floud doth swiftly swimme, The froathy mud is turn'd in a strange kind Into a frog, which yet vnshhap't behind Within the dirt enioys some small pastime, Halfe dead, and halfe aliue, halfe flesh, halfe slime. Of the snovv.Sometimes it hapneth, that the freezing cold Congeales the totall cloud; then we behold Great lockes of heauenly wooll to tumble downe, The trees vnleau'd, no grasse vpon the ground, The world hath all one die; aboue the snow The stagge his horned head can hardly shew. Of the baile.Sometimes it chanceth otherwise againe, Soone as the cloud is turned into raine, Th'excessiue cold that's in the middle loft, To haily bullets hardneth it full oft; Which falling downe (alas they so should fall) Our hoped vintage greedily forestall; Without a sickle reape our vnripe graine, Vnblossome all our trees, and do constraine The birds to leaue the neasts they lately made, Do rob the woods and groues of wonted shade, Do bruise our bullockes grazing as they go, Do make our verie houses cracke for woe, Of the vvinds hovv they are caused.If so the starres which Gods creating hand Sow'd scatteringly vpon the heauenly land, Draw fumes from off the earth both hote and dry, Their actiue fire would lodge them instantly In Phœbus lap: but they no sooner gaine The loft, where freezing cold doth still remaine, And feele the strength of their audacious foes, But straight they striue to gaine a sweete repose Vpon the earth from whence they did ascend, Assisted by the waight she did them lend. But from the fields there fumes another fire, Which comes to aide them in their backe retire Which stops their downeward course, restores their hearts, And weapons to their trembling hands imparts. With these fresh souldiers they fiercely fight, Now tumbling downe, now towring bolt vpright, Driuing now here, now there our aire along, According as the matter's weake, or strong. This holds but for a while, for in this fray The heate and cold both bearing equall sway, To end this stirre, one lets their vpward flight, The other stops their fall with all his might: So that this vapour taking litle rest, To moue in circled wise doth hold it best, And buzzing flies from pole to pole, from Spaine To Easterne India, and backe againe. These puffing winds although they quickned be The foure chief winds resembled to the foure seasons of the yeare, the foure humars of a mans bodie, the foure elements, and the foure ages. By spirit and vapour of like qualitie: Yet doth the diuerse place where they are borne, With diuerse names and power them all adorne. Whiles I obserue the foure winds principall, Which quarter out the cantons of this All, In their effects as humming on they flie, I find that they resemble properly Foure times of th'yeare, foure humors that abound, Foure simples, whereof nature doth compound Each mingled bodie, and the foure-fold age, Which man runs ouer in his pilgrimage. The wind which doth with faire Aurora dwell, The Eastwind. Resembles in his nature passing welll, The naked sommer and the tender age, The fire and choler (apt to kindle rage.) The wind which barbrous Africa doth greet, The South. Is like the ioyfull Spring, the aire most sweet: That age wherein man doth in strength excell, The bloud wherein the soule of man doth dwell. The wind which doth with drops bedew the West, The VVest. The water and the phlegme resembles best, The age wherein mans strength fals to decay, The time when hoarie winter beareth sway. The North.The wind which from the shiuering North doth flie, May be compar'd and not iniuriously, To Autumne, earth, and melancholie sad, And to the age when man becomes a lad. Not that vntill this time we haue not learned More winds then East, West, North and South are tearmed. The man that liues vpon the watrie plaine, Hath on his compasse noted thirtie twaine. Though, as the places number do exceed, From whence these exhalations do proceed; So are the winds in number numberlesse, Which cleanse the aire of mistie fogginesse. Yet from what place so ere they sallie forth, They mustred are by South, East, West or North. The effects of the winds.Sometimes they with a whizzing broome do sweepe The aire, where duskie cloudes their court do keepe, Sometimes they drie the fields which drowned bin, With teares of Phaeton his weeping kin. Sometimes they temper with a welcome cold The aire, which while the fainting dog-daies hold, Do frie for heate. They ripe the ruddie peare, The beane in huske, the corne within the eare. They make the winged ship to flie with ease, Throughout the world vpon the raging seas. And with a lingring hast whirling around The milstone, vnder which the graine is ground, To vndeuided atomies they bring The seed, which from the earth they made to spring. Diuerse effects of the hote exhalations.Now if the fume be hote and glutinous, And yet vnable to be mutinous Against the ysicles, that rule and raigne Amid the aire; then doth it still remaine, Houering betweene vs and the middle skie, Vntill it kindled be, and downeward flie: Iust like a squib (that serues for sportfull games) Or like an arrow feathered all with flames. But when againe the exhalation Of the comets. Surmounts cold winters habitation, It lights it selfe and makes a blazing starre, Foredooming some mischance that is not farre. But then his flame hauing more nouriture Then th'other vapour, longer doth endure; Whether the fume ytost withouten stay, Become a brand by heauens circled sway, Kindling it selfe like coales that ouer-spread With straw, do for a while lye seeming dead, Which afterward the artisan doth shake, Of darksome night a lightsome day to make: Or whether from the highest element, It do receiue his firie nutriment, Like as the torch of flaming life depriued, Is by the burning linke againe reuiued. According as the vapour's thicke or rare, Of the other fierie impressions in the aire. Long, equall, large, vnequall, round, or square, It makes those various shapes in th'aire appeare, Whose sight doth make the sottish quake for feare. Here doth a steeple seeme to flame by night, There doth a cruell dragon come in sight. Here is the torch, and there the arrow flies, The forked beame and speare here greet our eyes, And there the dart, which crossing in their waies, Clashing together sparkle out their raies. The wanton goate with firie tassels dight, By often skips doth simple men affright, The bloudie tresses of a twinkling starre, Do threaten on the other side from farre, To plague the neat-heards with tempestuous haile, With stormes to souce the mariners that saile, To punish shepheards with their flockes decay, And citizens with many a bloudie fray. What rumbling noise in heauen do I heare? Of the thunder. The wals of this great All as doth appeare, In euery corner suffer batterment, It seemes Proserpina hath some intent, To set at large her furious daughters three, And leaue her queenedome of blacke Tartarie, And in the aire to hold her hellish raigne. I know that some do studie to maintaine, That when the vapour doth ascend on high, Compact of aire and water euenly, And burning vapours mounting vp likewise Into the middle region of the skies, The hotter fume y compassed around With cold thicke cloudes which in the aire abound, Doubles his heate, and taking heart of grace, Makes warre on his cold neighbour foes apace. Simil.The lion banisht from the forrest wide His natiue home, and forced to abide In some straight den, where maides and idle boyes Do hisse, and mocke, and anger him with toyes, Doth fill his narrow parke with dreadfull sound, Runs forth and backe in such his straightned pound, And being mad, doth not so much desire His libertie, as to reuenge his ire: Right so this fier crauing for to rent His floating prison, cannot be content; But still bestirs him running round about, With grumbling, rumbling, and a thundring rout, Vntill he make a renting breach below, And thundring cannon-shot on vs do throw. For longing in these sharpe and cruell warres, To ioyne his weake enfeebled souldiers Vnto his brother forces, and obtaine In Cynthia's lap that he may still remaine; He snarlingly endeuours foorth to get, But with so huge an host he is beset, And so intrenched euery where about, That though he striue on this side to get out, And now on that side skirmish with the cold, Yet finds he many a souldier that is bold, Couragiously to stand against his strength, And so despairing, furiously at length Forgets his honour, and doth backe retire, With shame enough as wanting his desire. The ocean boiles for feare, and Neptunes band, Effects of the thunder. Finding the sea too straight, do hie to land. The earth doth quake, the shepheard all alone, Is hardly safe vnder the rockie stone. The skie is rift in twaine, and Plutoes selfe Lookes pale and bleake like some night-wandring else. The aire doth flame throughout with firie flashes, For then the lightning which so fiercely dashes Against the cloud, the which it doth surprise, Doth sparkle foorth those flames which dimme our eyes. Right like the man on whom the Muses fawne, Simil. Doth with his steele before the morning dawne, Compell the sparkes to issue from the flint Vntill they kindle his halfe burned lint. And which is more, the lightning being framed Strange effects of the lightning. Of fumes which of themselues are still enflamed, Can breake the bones with his admired art, Yet keepe the flesh from feeling any smart: Can melt the coine wherewith the niggard's blest, Yet with his burning force not hurt the chest: Can breake the foyning blade short off in twaine, Yet misse the scabbard that doth it containe: Can kill the babe, ere it be brought to light, Yet to the mother offer no despight, Who with the strange euent astonished, Doth see her child no sooner borne then dead. Can burne the shoo, and not offend the foot, Nor pierce the tunne, yet draw the liquour out. I haue beheld with these (then younger) eyes, This thundring flame a woman to surprise, Example. And from those parts to whiffe away the haires, Which here to name my modest Muse forbeares. Of the circles about the Sun and Moone.Shall I conceale those various shapes, which be Painted in heauens face? Sometimes I see A firie circle fram'd of many a ray, Which Sunne and Moone, and other starres display; Which on some cloude whiles they are darted downe, Of substance thicke, and by his figure round, Through which they cannot passe with all their strength, Flie round about the edges at the length, And do a crowne resemble very right. Like as the torch, which when it burneth bright Within some angle of a darkesome cell, Whose gate is bolted, cannot very well Send through the doore the lustre of his raies, But by the chinkes his flaming light displaies. Of the rainebow.But when the Sun begins himselfe to shrowd In Thetis bed, and on some aduerse clowd, Vnable any longer to containe His watrie humour, shootes his beames amaine; Then doth he shadow his resplendent face Vpon that cloude, and variously doth trace The bending of that partie-coloured bow, Whose sight doth glad our faces here below. For th'aduerse cloude, which doth the arrowes take Of this great archer, instantly doth make That on the neighbour cloude they backe rebound, And doth with Titans golden beames compound His various colours: altogether like The Sun, which while his darts some violl strike Vpon thy window, thou dost straight espie The trembling brightnesse banded vpwardly, Against the feeling of thy glittering hall. Of the diuerse Suns &amp; Moons which are somtimes seen.But if contrariwise the cloude do fall, Not ore against, nor vnder, but beside The Sunne or Moone, (the heauens nightly pride) Both one and th'other on that cloude do trace, With powerfull skill their two or three-fold face, The sillie vulgar are astonished, To see at once three coachmen furnished, To draw the Sun, the father of the day; And that the night for anger doth assay, To haue more Moones in heauen to remaine, And there as crowned Queenes to rule and raigne. But why (ô foolish men) go ye about, An Apostrophe to those that wholy ground themselues vpon reason. To search the wonders of th'Almighty out With your so shallow sence? what proud desire, Nay madnesse rather, makes you so aspire Without his helpe to open all his workes? I know that in a learned man there lurkes That skill, whereby he can some reason show, Of whatsoeuer moueth here below: But not so sound, that he may leaue a man Without all scruple; and if so he can, Yet of these instruments when we do boast, We should commend those cunning fingers most, Which set them all on worke, and by such waies Things more then dead to life againe do raise. When thunder roares, that voice me seemeth rings, The religious vse that we should make of these meteors and impressions. Which makes kings shepheards, and of shepheards kings. The towre-bruising shocke of lightning, telleth What wondrous power in Gods right hand there dwelleth. When as I see the flashes in the aire, I see beames of Gods eyes diuinely faire. When timely raine doth fall, I then espie, How he showres downe his blessings plenteously. When as the bridges in the fields are drownd, And streames do ouerwhelme our tilled ground; Me thinkes that God doth weepingly lament Those sinnes, whereof we neuer do repent. And neuer doth the bow in heauen appeare, But it's a seale and pledge to me most deare, That neuer more the vniuersall floud, Shall proudly ouerwaue that forrest wood, Which Atlas seemeth in the cloudes to hide, Or doth on snowie Caucasus abide. But chiefly I am mou'd, when heauens ire, Salutes our eyes with prodigies of fire: When this great All is all disordered, And his old customes strangely altered. The most learned vnable to assigne true reasons of all accidents.Suppose there do in some one scholer flourish As many wits, as Pallas deignes to nourish: And let thilke man out of his subtill braine, Shew me a certaine reason of the raine, Of milke, and flesh, and wooll, which whilome fell From heauen; and let his deeper skill me tell, How in the clouds that store of graine might grow, Which hath bene seene at twise to ouerflow That part of Germanie where it did fall, Which vulgarly Carinthia men do call. The heauens great King doth now and then delight, To crosse each where the course of natures might: Minding that such irregularities, Should heralds be of future miseries. That firie showre which once was seene to raigne On the Plutarch in the life of Crassus. Lucanian fields; (when Rome did traine, And send their brauest souldiers to that field, Which vnto fat Euphrates way doth yeeld) Foretold the Parthians neuer missing bow, Should all th' Italian armies ouerthrow. That ratling noise of armes, those trumpets sound, Which from aboue did simple men astound, (While as the Plutarch in the life of Marius. Romaines most couragious crew, So many Danes and Almaines fiercely slew) Tell vs that chaunce in nature worketh nought, Against the errors Epicurus taught. Thou which dost see the lightnings three-fold stroke Dash out A certaine Arrian Bishop, who for his horrible blasphemies, was slaine by the lightning. Olympus braines, which did prouoke Blasphemously the triple-vnitie: Dar'st thou presume t'expect impunity From God, while thou dost barke against his Grace, And shamest not to spit vpon his face, Whose iustice neuer leaues vnpunished Blasphemous mouths against him opened? Thou Iew, no Iew, but now a barbrous seed Of Turkish, 'Scythian, or Tartarian breed; What is thy thought, when as thou dost espie Thy Iosephus in the vvarres of the Ievves. temple threatned with a sword on high? But that th' Almightie with his powerfull hand, Should powre his vengeance downe vpon thy land. That dearth and famine should sweepe them away, Which to the pestilence were not a pray: And that the sword should seaze on them againe, Which had escaped from the former twaine: That execrable mothers in that stowre, Their miserable children should deuoure: That there the plough his rustinesse should scowre, Where flourished of late thy stately bowre. And all for murdring in thy deadly strife, That King which came from heauen to giue thee life. That streame of bloud which once was seene to flow, Those craggie rockes from whence great Ioue did throw His fearefull lightning on Liguria land, And all those bloudie crosses seeme to stand On mournefull habits of appearing men, Did seeme to cry with open mouth, that then In Genes the Turke with his enraged crew, Should pitch their standards, as it did ensue. O franticke Fraunce, how is't thou gainest nought, An apostrophe to his ovvne countrey of Fraunce. By all those signes whereby thy God hath sought To call thee home? canst thou with tearlesse eyes Behold those fearefull firie prodigies, Wherewith the heauens do vs all affright, That He vnderstands the comet seene in the yeare 1577 blazing starre which threatens euerie night, Our land with warre, with pestilence and hunger, Three deadly points of that prepared thunder, Which when th'Almightie ginneth once to frowne, On vs rebellious men he powreth downe? But what (alas) can heauen vnarm'd preuaile, When as thy backe thresh'd with so many a flaile, Drawes not one sigh from thy obdurate heart? Thou art delighted with thy painefull smart, Thy hunger makes thee on thy flesh to feed, And makes thy bloud thy drinke; and thou indeed As dull as one that hath the lethargie, Shunnest the salue might cure thy maladie, The more thou feel'st the spurre, the more thou tirest, And voide of holy care, thou lesse desirest T'amend thy wayes, but like an Asse dost striue To fat thy selfe with blowes, with losse to thriue: And as the iron or the steeled blade, So thou by hammering art harder made. But better twere I see this talke to end, Then speaking to the deafe my time mispend: I see twere better tread my wonted way, And in my verse Gods greatest workes display. Of the elementarie fire.As then in court the king is hemmed in With princes of his royall bloud and kin, And next to them with nobles of his traine, And after them with magistrates againe, Marching along in order and degree, As they are nearest to his Maiestie: So God in order wisely did dispose, That Cinthia should that element enclose, Which did in his resplendent actiuenesse The nature of the heauens best expresse; And after him, the others as they bene Annear'd vnto the planets by their kin. And yet foole-many crediting their eyes Aboue their reason, many wayes deuise To pull this essence from his natiue place, And with his want this lower All deface. The fier giuing brightnesse, heate and flame, Ignis encomium. Welspring of motion, Alchymist of fame, A cleanser, quickner, smith and souldier, Bell-founder, surgeon, cooke and cannoner, And goldsmith too, which doth and can do all, Embracing round the aire and earthie ball. If so the fire (say they) encamped be Obiection. Betweene the heauen and vs, then should we see The same by night; for then our eyes do marke The shining glowormes in the greatest darke. Besides, how should we see the worldes eyne, Throughout so great an element to shine? Sith that with vs the sharpest sighted eye Can nothing through a candles flame espie, You vnbeleeuing men, if so the puffes Solution. Of wanton Zephirus, or angrie snuffes Of rainie Auster, made you not beleeue They haue a being, you would credence giue, That from the earth vnto the firmament, There were a vacuum and no element. And your opinion would aswell desire, To thinke no aire, as to conceiue no fire. Those torches wherewith we prolong the dayes The difference betvveene the elementarie and our mixt fire. (Which in the winter Capricorne assaies To drowne in Westerne seas, t'enlarge the night) Compar'd vnto the Sunne, the heauens great light, Are lesse, by many hundreth times, obscure, Then is our mixt and compound fire impure, Compar'd to that resplendent element, This lower Vniuerse his chiefest ornament. Our fire is nothing but a lightsome shade Of darksome thicke and pitchie grosenesse made: But that aboue, by being wholy pure From mixture of compounded nouriture. And being farre remoued from our sight, And vnacquainted with the blustering might Of Æolus, doth much resemblance beare Vnto the nature of the heauenly spheare. Of the matter of the heauens.But (heauenly God) what matter may I name, Of which thou didst the heauenly arches frame? Vncertaine, I resemble euerie howre, The cocke that stands vpon some steepled towre, Which doth as oft new place and maister find, As in the aire we feele a change of wind. Sometimes I am of Aristotles traine, Sometimes I follow Plato's mind againe; Tracking the foot-steps of the Stagirite, I rob the firmament of mixture quite. I do auerre that Gods omnipotence Did fashion heauen of a quintessence: Sith that the elements directly flie, Some to the center, others to the skie. But heauens course giuing no inch of ground, Is euer turned in a circled round. Their motion dures not, but they so abide, As God the worlds first day did them diuide: But neuer-breathing heauen still doth runne, That constant posting course it hath begun: It treads one path, mou'd with vnburdened waight, And knowes not what it is a teeme to baite. The earth and water, fire and aire vnited, Are with an inbred warring hate delighted, Causing in time their springing and their fall, Increase and decrease; suffring not at all, Beneath the horned planet any forme, For one halfe houre one subiect to adorne: But heauen neuer knowes death's equall rigor, Growing in yeares, it groweth not in vigor, Nor weares with vse, but's flowring eld may beare Resemblance to his childhood euery where. Tracing againe the steps of Plato's skill, Hovv and to vvhat vse the elements may be in the heauens, according to Platoes opinion. The heau'nly orbes with elements I fill. Th'earth makes them solid, that they neuer craue A fleeting disposition to haue; The aire transparant, fire makes them light, Hote, nimble, actiue, and resplendant bright. And all the eadges which do counter-kisse Their fellow-wheeling globes, do neuer misse Of water, whose cold humor stops the course Of burning heate, arising from the source Of their swift motion, lest the heauenly land Should be conuerted to a flaming brand. Not that I equalize these elements, The difference betweene those elements wherof the heauens, and those whereof the Sublunarie bodies are compounded. Of which I frame the heau'nly tenements, To those dull bodies which are here below, Which men by sight and frequent handling know. They are all pure, a heau'nly harmonie Combines their substances eternally. Their aire is free from tossing, and their fire From burning; and their earth doth not desire From his high mansion to tumble downe, Nor doth their water fleete vpon the ground. Lo, here th'extent of humane surque drie Blinded with error and simplicitie, Which dares (as though his cunning could calcine The matter of the heau'nly orbes) define With an vnbridled tongue, what wood and stone Th'Almightie chose to carpenter his throne. I rather had still doubtfull to remaine, Then lead awrie the simple of my traine; Waiting for holie Paul his rediscent: Or freed from the vicious pesterment Of this rebellious flesh, which doth depresse My clogged soule with counter-heauinesse, Diuerse opinions touching the number of the spheares. These eyes may see the beauties of that place, If then I ought would see saue Gods bright face, But men as manie curious questions moue, About the number of the spheares aboue: One holds but one, through which he makes to glide The eyes, wherewith this All is beautifide: Like as amid the sea, the scaly traine Diuide the surges of the watrie plaine. Another iudging all things by his eye, Marking the seauen planets in the skie To haue a diuerse course; and that beside The other starres (which fixed do abide, Guilding by night the heau'nly firmament) Runne but one way; his wise experiment By such his obseruation hath found, Eight sundry lofts in the celestiall round. Another marking in the starrie skie, A three-fold motion dancing actiuely, And that one bodie hath but one sole race By naturall instinct; doth forthwith place A ninth and tenth, not numbring in that count Th imperiall spheare, which doth the rest surmount; Where streames of nectar neuer cease to flow, Where soule-delighting pleasures euer grow, Where one may see at all times flourishing The pleasing beauties of a happie spring; Where life doth neuer die through crooked eld, Where Gods high parliament is alway held His glorious essence being hemmed in With troupes of many a flaming Seraphin, And soules of men which he hath purchased By hauing of that bodie murthered, Whose glorious resurrection and ascent, Hath plac'd the earth aboue the firmament. But here ile stop my ouer-posting teame. Not daring to discusse so deepe a theame. Cæli encomion.O faire and ten-fold round, which hat'st to stay, Life of this Vniuerse, spring of the day, Mould of thy selfe, begetter of the yeare, Which neuer changest place, yet dost appeare To flie so fast, that onely in our mind, We can thy neuer-lingring motion find: Finite, yet infinite, from growing free, From discord, death and hatefull miserie, Which louest sound and dancing harmonie, still like thy selfe in all eternitie, Transparant, light, law of this lower round; Which with thy limits euery thing dost bound, And yet vnbounded art, which dost enfold What euer thing this lower All doth hold, Throne of great Ioue: I willingly would sing The various orders of thy quauering, If time would giue me leaue, and that this Day Would not be ouer-long by that essay. Besides, I feare that some detracting tongue, Will blab abroad among each vulgar throng, That to each gale of wind for small auaile, My tatling Muse doth spread her fardled saile; And that a longer web she moughten weaue, She quils each thread, not caring when to leaue. But thinke who ere thou be, that reasonlesse I do not here so many workes expresse Of the creation; sith I vnderstand By that great firmament (which Gods right hand VVhat is vnderstood by the firmament. Gen. 1. 6. Did hang this day betweene our watrie plaine, And that aboue the skie) the whirling traine Of spheares and aire, and th'hottest element, Which make a large deuiding sunderment Betweene the waters of our azurde deepe, And those which God aboue the skie doth keepe. Now in the learned bookes of high esteeme, Against those which hold no vvaters aboue the firmament. My ignorance hath not so litle seene, But well I know, that their so curious skill Presumes with subtile arguments to fill Their volumes, scoffing at the christall spheare, And at the waters which are placed there, And at that ocean which doth all containe Which vnderneath his compasse doth remaine. Simil.But as a modest matrons beauteous face, (Who as contented with the bounteous grace Which nature franckly hath bestow'd vpon her, Striues not with painting to increase her honour Of her so faire art-wanting countenance) Deserues more praise, then doth th'immodest glaunce, The wanton gesture, and the mincing pace, The borrowed tresses and depainted grace, Wherewith a curtisan of filthie trade Maintaines her beauty which begins to fade: So of the holy tongue I more account, Although the country phrase it not surmount, And that bare truth be her sole ornaments, Then of Athenian painted eloquence And guilded lines, wherewith men striue to shade The errors, which their vaine conceits haue made. I rather had my reason oft should lie, Then from the sacred truth once go awry, Gen. 1. 6. Psal. 104. 3. 148. 4.Which in so manie places loud doth crie, That God hath plac'd some waters ore the skie. Be it that their estranged qualitie, With these below haue small affinitie: Or turn'd vnto a cloudie element, Do compasse round the starrie firmament: Or be it (as some say) a christall spheare, Embrace the golden firmament each where. And why shall I tost with vncertainties, Conclude of these as doubtlesse verities? Arg. a pari.I see not why mans reasonable sence Should not beleeue, that his omnipotence, Who whilome made the sea like wals to stand For Iacobs troupe to passe as on dry land, Could not aboue the wheeling globes compose That watrie spheare, the others to enclose. Thou seest that euerie howre the clouds containe, So many seas which threatning vs with raine, Are only vnderpropt with feeble aire, Tost with each wind that thither doth repaire, And yet so weake, that it can hardly beare The litlest burthen any one can reare. Thou seest the sea which doth our mother bound, Spite of all accidents remaineth round; His waues not daring once their bounds to passe, To equalize their circled watrie masse. Why then beleeu'st thou not this vaulted spheare Vpon his backe a totall sea may beare, Yet that the water firmely may abide? O stonie heart, perswade thy selfe beside, That God sustaines those waters in that case; And thinke if natures working take such place, Arg. a minori. That pearle and christall glasse are by her skill Compos'd of streames, which droppingly distill; What then at once can the Almightie do, Which did create both heauen and nature too? Perswade thy vnbeleeuing mind againe, That this proud pallace where thou hold'st thy raigne, Tho built with wondrous art, would soone decay, If on a watrie ground it did not stay. For as the braine doth hold the highest seate Simil. Of mans small vniuerse, t'alay the heate Which from the cordiall parts doth euer flow, With his coole moisture; altogether so, That God might mixe the water with the flame, And coole the ardor of the heau'nly frame, He plac'd aboue the starrie firmament, A vaulted sea of that moist element. Mentioning the waters aboue the firmament, he assumes occasion to mention the floud, which he describes most elegantly. These higher waters (as the stories go) Ioyning themselues vnto the flouds below, And striuing with their ouer-swelling pride, The proudest mountaine tops with waues to hide, Had drown'd this All, if (dancing on the floud) Noe had not shut the world into a wood; Building an Arke, a huge and mightie frame, Keeping aliue all creatures in the same. They were no sooner in, but straight the Lord With onely power of his all-mightie word, Opened the doore of that vast, horrid caue, Where Æolus his crew their dwelling haue; And bolted in the cloud-expelling North, And let the rainy southerne issue forth; Which gins forthwith to wag his dropping wing, His beard hath no one haire but is a spring: A night of clouds enuellops him around, His hanging lockes in raine are showred downe, And whiles the thickest clouds he fiercely dashes, They breake out into showers and stormie flashes. The froathie torrent, and the riuer stowre, Do make each other swell in one selfe howre; Their mingled waters scorne their former bankes, Runne to the sea to play their furious prankes, Spoiling the hopefull haruest as they goe, The earth doth quake and sweate for very woe, Not leauing in her vaines one watrie drop. And thou, ô heauen, thy scluses doest vnstop, To plague thy sister earth, whose former race Was shamelesse, lawlesse and withouten grace; Who tooke her onely and her chiefe delight, To offer to her maker mickle spite. The land is hid, now Neptune hath no shore, The riuers bend their course to him no more, They are a sea themselues, and all the number Of seas, which earst deuided were asunder, Make but one ocean; yea this vniuerse Is nothing but a watrie wildernesse, Which longs to ioyne his liquid wauing plaine, Vnto the flouds which in the heauens remaine. The sturgeon coasting by the castled bowres, Admires the drowning of so many towres. The mular and the manat side those rockes, Where lately fed the wantonizing flockes Of bearded goates: the Dolphin cuts the floud Where it surmounts the highest mountaine wood. The horse, the tyger, hart, the hound, the hare, By their swift paces now vnsuccour'd are: They seeke for ground (alas) but tis no booting, For still they see they lose their hoped footing. The beauer, torteise and the crocodile, Which did enioy a two-fold house ere while, Haue nought but water now wherein to dwell: The tender lambkins and the Lyons fell, The rauenous wolfe, the nimble fallow deare, Swimme side by side without suspitious feare; The swallow, yearly Herauld of the spring, The vulture hatch'd for hatefull rauening, fighting, and striuing longer to contend, Against their certaine neare approaching end, Not finding where to pearch themselues againe, Do fall at length into the angred maine. As for poore men in that tempestuous stowre, Imagine one to get some loftie tower, Another to ascend some mountaine hill, Another practising his climbing skill, With hands and feete clasping some cedar tree, Striuing vpon his vpmost top to be; But still the floud rising as they ascend, If once they stay, their sinfull life doth end. One hardily vpon some planke doth venter, Another doth into some coffer enter, Another swimmeth in some kneading tub, Another halfe asleepe perceiues the floud T'assaile his bed and life at once; another Keepes with his armes and legs a swimming pother. Whereby he may resist the waters wrath, Whose rage but euen then deuoured hath Hard by his side his sister and his brother, His friend, his child, his father and his mother: But wearied at the length doth yeeld againe, Vnto the mercie of the cruell maine. All stand at once at death his loathed doore, But yet the cruell Parca, which of yore Were arm'd with many a murthering deuice, To rake to them the things of greatest price, No other hangmen at this instant haue, Beside the fro athie ouer-whelming waue. Meane while the Arke securely doth remaine, Vpon the surges of that watrie plaine; Tho all vnrigd from any hauen farre, For God was both her pilote and her starre. Thrise fiftie dayes this monstrous floud did stay, Making of all this lower All a pray, Vntill this spoile had mou'd at length the Lord, Who had no sooner sounded with his word Vnto those wasting flouds a backe retire, But instantly the billowes do conspire, To runne vnto their former place and state; And straight the swelling riuers do abate: The sea bounds in it selfe, the hils appeare, The forrest trees which drowned were whileare, Do shew their slimie boughes; the champion field Encreaseth as the waters backward yeeld. And to be briefe, Gods thunder-shooting hand Did let the Sunne behold againe the land; That he againe might see the smoake arise, Of a deuout, sweet-smelling sacrifice, Fuming with sweete Panchayan franke-incense, Vnto the praise of his omnipotence. He concludeth vvith a prayer for the Church.O God, sith thou art pleas'd in this our age, To saue thy holy ship from stormie rage; Graunt that those few, whose setled confidence Is anchored on thy sacred prouidence, May by thy blessing euermore increase In number, faith and loue, the bond of peace.
