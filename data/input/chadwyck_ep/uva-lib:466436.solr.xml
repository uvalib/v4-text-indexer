      <field name="fulltext">PART I. BALLADS AND LYRICS. AT RANDOM SOWN. I scattered my rhymes on the barren ground, Nought was its barrenness to me; Or cast them adrift on the vagrant winds, And the stormy billows of the sea. I never cared, or sought to know, Whether like fruitful seeds they grew, Whether they perished as soon as born, Or faded away like the morning dew; Whether men heeded them or despised;— For the light must shine, the lark must sing, And the rose unfold its blushing buds To the warm embraces of the spring. And yet, though careless as the flowers That shed their odours on the air, I dreamed a dream that grew to a hope, That as the thistledown might bear A living germ in its small balloon, Some of my fancies, robed in rhyme, Might fall perchance upon fruitful soil. And root and ripen in their time,— Ripen in hearts as yet unborn, To strengthen the weak, console the poor, To cheer the brave in their conquering march, And teach the wretched to endure. Life's hard battle permits no truce, And every age needs warriors strong; And even a Rhyme may pierce like a sword The armour that protects the wrong! THE GREAT WORLD AND THE POET. “At God's great table is there room for me?” Enquired the Poet, in his youthful glee: “I'm strong of purpose, and content to toil, But cannot spin, or weave, or delve the soil; I have no knowledge of the ‘bought’ or ‘sold,’ And cannot barter honesty for gold! I can do nothing,—but, like bird on spray, Or lark that soars to hail the dawning day, Or tender nightingale that all night long Pours to the listening world its rapturous song, 'Tis mine to sing, with earnest voice and clear, My songs of hope and joy for men to hear, Until their hearts throb, and their eyes illume;— At God's great table, tell me is there room?” The Great World answered, “All the seats are taken— Not one is void, or like to be forsaken; The fighters, and the doers, and the traders, Fill them all up, and suffer no invaders; But thou canst take thy choice, and watch, and wait For falling crumbs that haply, soon or late, May be thy dole in the distressful hour When strength should fail and sorrows overpower; Why shouldst thou murmur? If it give thee pleasure To ease thy heart in thy melodious measure, And charm the nations, thou art overpaid In the enjoyment thou thyself hast made,— I need thee not, and cannot give thee gold. Poets were many in the days of old, And these suffice me. Great is thy reward If far Futurity shall hail thee ‘Bard!’ And carve thy name on the recording stone, To make thy virtues and thy merits known. So shall admiring crowds, as yet unborn, Wipe out remembrance of the bygone scorn, And yield their useless homage at thy tomb:” Sing on, O Poet,—and accept thy doom! EPICURUS AND THE SPHINX. I Oh, melancholy Sphinx! the haunting glare Of thy stone eyes Vexes my soul, and goads me to despair With mysteries Too deeply hidden in the vast unknown For narrow Reason, on her doubtful throne, To probe and scan. Why ask me to declare what Nature is, And why God fashioned for their bale or bliss The Earth and Man? II And why the Evil which we feel and see In Nature's scheme Should be a fact in cruel Destiny, And not a dream? And why it should, since Time's perplexing birth, Over our lovely and prolific Earth Its shadow cast, And track the populous planets on their way, Lord of the Present and the Future day, As of the Past? III Why should I strive to see the reason why, Through narrow chinks? Dark are thy riddles, and beyond reply, Oh, torturing Sphinx! If Good for ever is at war with Ill, And Good is God's unconquerable will, I'll seek no more To solve the mystery of His design, Beyond the scope of reason to define, On Time's dark shore. IV I am—I think—I love; and while I live And it is Day, I will enjoy the blessings it can give While yet I may. Joy breathes around me in the wholesome air; All Nature smiles: the Universe is fair With heavenly light;— For me, the sun downpours its rays of gold, The rivers roll, and all the flowers unfold Their blossoms bright. V For me the stars the eloquent sky illume; For me the Spring Inspires with love and joy and fruitful bloom Each living thing; For me the grapes grow mellow on the stalk; For me wit sparkles and old sages talk Of noble deeds; The blythe lark carols in the light of morn; The reapers mow the golden-bearded corn To serve my needs. VI For me the vintage sparkles in the bowl, And woman's wiles, Sweet as herself, invade my heart and soul, That love her smiles. Oh, Sphinx! thy riddles shut the daylight out, Faith is the anchor of the true devout, And Hope their guide; And when my last hour comes, may every friend Say I lived bravely till the destined end— And bravely died! MY MUSES. I cannot think apart From the mountain and the sea, From the dew upon the grass, From the daisy on the lea, From the forest leaves that whisper Where the wild wind passes by, From the clouds that float like ships On the ocean of the sky, From the stars that gem the darkness Of the deep eternal blue, From the foam-crests of the billows And the dip of the sea-mew, From the prattle of the children, From the look that understands, From the smile of true affection, From the grasp of friendly hands, From the peal of happy laughter, From the sympathy of tears, From the solitude that teaches, From society that cheers. All nature is my comrade, My teacher and my friend; My best of boon companions, To give, to share, to lend: It feeds my heart and spirit Whenever I would write, And guides me and inspires me In all that I indite. Idle the song or poem May seem to sordid men; But Heart is in my meaning, And Love is in my pen! ODOURS. Crush me, proud world! as Beauty crushes The floweret that adorns her breast, And breathes the balmy scent that gushes From the fair petals she has press'd; Yes! crush me, if 'tis Fate's decree; Perchance the odours that exhale At Sorrow's heavy hand may be Refreshing to the wayward gale; And footsore travellers passing by May breathe and bless me in a sigh! THE SECRET DRAWER. In idle mood I touched the springs That opened wide the secret drawer, To gaze on half forgotten things That waked the memories of yore,— Small scraps of letters loosely tied With silken bands of faded blue, Containing words of love and pride Wrung from my heart when life was new; A lock of radiant golden hair That once adorned a glorious head Of a young angel, heavenly fair, And long since numbered with the dead; A dark brown tress—the sole remains Of a brave woman lost and gone, The partner of my joys and pains, Whose smile made sunlight where it shone. I sighed, I kissed them like a fool— Although perhaps the fool was wise With wisdom learned in sorrow's school— Who saw the truth through all disguise. And taking counsel with my thought, I asked myself, 'mid haze of tears, Why these fond relics, fancy-fraught, Should live beyond my span of years?— Live with their tale of thought or deed, For merchandise in scandal's mart, To satisfy the clamorous greed Of scribblers who dissect my heart, When I lie slumbering in the mould, Unweeting of Fame's noisy blast, And sell for miserable gold The sacred secrets of the past? To build romances from my life, Or weave the lies that seem like truth, From shadows of long-ended strife And unknown agonies of youth? Take them, ye flames! such fate is best; All but the locks of hair I crave To wear upon my living breast, And perish with me in the grave! GOOD OUT OF EVIL. I thank thee, O mine enemy! For spiteful word and thought, For arrowy scorn of malice born, And harm thou wouldst have wrought; For by no merit of thine own, Or power to do me ill, The words that from thy lips have flown Have falsified thy will. Thy thoughts that would have done me wrong Fate read in kindlier mood, And seeming evils turned ere long To unexpected good; The drop of poison in the bowl Became a sweetness rare, As clouds when riven, leave light in heaven And healing in the air. Thy hand impelled with deadly force The missiles of thy hate, But pitying Heaven descried their course And winged the bolts of Fate: Thou wert mine enemy, God wot, But in the blessed end, Each shaft at pitiless random shot Was guided by a friend! AT THE CRADLE OF ROBERT BURNS. The First Angel. Beside the cradle where the infant slept A pensive Angel sat—love in her mind, And heavenly pity. Mournful watch she kept, And sighed to think what Destiny designed For this small morsel of humanity That lay before her in unconscious rest, A vernal blossom opening timidly Its tender leaflets to the fostering west, Unheeding of the swift approaching doom That hovered o'er it in the stormy day Of coming manhood, dark with lurid gloom. “Unhappy boy!” she said. “On life's rough way, Endowed with passions wild and judgment strong, To keep thee right or lead thy steps astray— Ever at war in thy tumultuous heart, Conquerors neither! but they'll struggle long To doubtful issues 'twixt the right and wrong, And tempt thee to forsake the nobler part. Cold grinding Poverty shall watch the fray And gnaw thy vitals till thy dying day, With all its cruel and debasing train Of mental torture and perennial pain; But thou shalt rise the victor o'er them all, Lord of thy destiny, whate'er befall, And stand erect in Fate's supremest hour, Defying fortune and its utmost power To quench thy proud, unyielding self-control, Or humble thy pre-eminence of soul. Great shall thy sorrows and thy sufferings be, And short the span of life thy years shall see; But in that little span, with strength innate, Thou shalt confront unmoved the hardest fate, And write thy name on the historic page, Poet and wit and marvel of the age; And dying leave thy memory to the crowd Of all the ‘unco guid’ and pious proud, Who'll scorn and scoff at, as beyond their ken, The humble ploughman, born a king of men; They'll note thy vices with a saintly groan, But draw a veil discreetly o'er their own!” Second Angel. “Auspicious babe!” the second Angel said, “I see the rays of glory round thy head, And hear the unborn multitudes acclaim In Earth's remotest climes thy honoured name! Forlorn and sad thy path through life may be, But high renown shall gild thy memory: Thy words shall charm, ennoble and inspire, And warm the popular heart with patriot fire, And teach the poorest drudge that Fortune's ban Cannot degrade the bravely honest man,— And that the proud who owe their rank and state To royal favour are but meanly great If their nobility in deed and word Be not inherent in the rank conferr'd,— And that a vulgar self-sufficient churl May call himself a Marquis, Duke, or Earl, And fail to make himself a gentleman, Spite of the noble fathers of the clan, Who gave him life, though powerless to impart Clearness of head and purity of heart;— This shalt thou teach in language terse and strong, Enshrined for ever in immortal song Sung by the teeming nations yet to be In lands where now the savage wanders free, But where thy gallant countrymen shall roam In countless multitudes to find a home, Where every man shall feel that he's a man; ‘A man for a' that’ in the social plan! And happy millions shall in pride combine To vaunt themselves as countrymen of thine— Type of their manhood and their honest worth, Lords of themselves and freemen of the Earth!” THE POET'S HOPE. I Whis Age is the age of the Mocker, When Reverence droops and dies, And nothing is lovely but money And the vice that money buys; How can I hope for acceptance, Singing an earnest song 'Mid the roar of derisive trumpets Bellowing loud and long? When clowns out-value sages And wisdom sits forlorn, And the lords of the popular humour Are apathy and scorn? II How can I hope for listeners, When the men who think are few If I teach that better than money Is the love of the good and true? If I'd cheer the sorrow-stricken Beneath the load they bear, Or shed the light of comfort On the darkness of despair? For deaf to the song and the music Are the ears of the callous crowd, And the worshippers of Mammon Are the selfish and the proud. III Courage, my heart, and fear not! Nor think thy fate is hard: If to-day refuse to hear thee, To-morrow may bring reward! A steadfast hope inspires thee, And shines from the far to be, That a light on thy gravestone shining May gild thy memory, That the strong true heart of the people May throb to hear thy name, And that tardy recognition May blossom into fame! IV But if thy record perish, Foredoomed, maybe, to sink In the deep sea of Oblivion Wave-washed from the shelving brink, Thy thoughts in the bright hereafter In the people's heart may glow, Refining and consoling Alike in their joy or woe. No truth, if great and worthy, Was ever taught in vain, But shines in eternal sunshine, Or dies but to live again! TWIN SISTERS. In the same moment of that pitiless time When earth first made its circuit round the sun, Two sisters, different in mind and face, Were born into the world; and they were twins, Inseparable, but hostile each to each. Never since then, through long millenniums pass'd, Have they been parted; never shall they part, Save for the breathing space that Fate allows To the sped arrow ere it reach its mark, As long as kings and wicked men enact The fearful tragedies that scare the world And plague it with untold calamities. The elder has a smile upon her lips And a bright sparkle in her covetous eyes, And only lives for base and animal joys; The younger has a face serene and sad, Furrowed at times with melancholy wrath, And only lives for duty to be done. They sleep together in the selfsame bed, They eat together at the selfsame board, And walk together on the selfsame road; But their minds differ, and their purposes Are as divergent as the night and day, The heat and cold—the wrong way and the right. The joyous elder-born seeks not to know What her sad sister thinks or plans or acts, Or cares to recognise that she exists In closest kinship with her heedless self, But goes upon her way and works her will, Unconscious of the footfall in the rear Of her who follows, watchful and alert, Close as her shadow. But the younger-born, Stern and relentless, with a stony heart Where awful Justice sits as on a throne, Bides patiently her time—and then she strikes With blow unerring as the bolts of Heaven: The one is Crime, the other Punishment. THE MIST AND THE STORM. I Mist and cloud and humid vapours Lie upon the souls of men, Dull and stifling exhalations Rising from a stagnant fen. Sunshine seldom cheers their eyesight, Earthwards bending evermore, Prying into filthy gutters For the gold that they adore: II Gold which purchases the pleasures Their degraded nature craves— Homage, mastery and dominion Over needier fools and knaves. Power and leisure for enjoyment In the enervating stye Where the sensual self-indulgers Grunt and wallow till they die! III In the murky mist their reason Is absorb'd in low desire, Or if not extinguished wholly, Grovels when it should aspire. Deaf to rumblings of the tempest Gathering o'er them unaware, That shall burst in hail and thunder And disturb and clear the air. IV All the brave old-fashioned virtues Shrink and shrivel to decay; Reverence, earnestness and honour Dwindle, pine and melt away. Slang usurps the place of language Such as men and women spoke In the days when noble England Bred and trained a noble folk. V Laughter fades into a giggle Or the grin of dull buffoons; Generous thoughts are deemed a folly, Love is ridiculed as “spoons.” Honest wit is quenched by punning, Wholesome mirth is “ungenteel”; And success is greatly honoured E'en although it lie and steal. VI Each inferior brainless creature, Simmering in his self-conceit, With the manners of the gutter And the jargon of the street, Thinks himself as good—and better Than the noble and the great, And by virtue of the suffrage Helps to rule and wreck the State. VII Liberty and Gold are idols Bright and fair to outward view: Liberty for fools to govern All the wise and just and true,— Gold to help them to be tyrants In humanity's despite, And to buy in cheapest markets Wrong that passes off as Right. VIII Adam Smith out-values Jesus In the piety of trade, Uttering truths of greater wisdom Than the gospel e'er conveyed. Jesus Christ says, “Love your neighbour;” Trade says, “Cheat him if you can, Grind him, crush him and oppress him,— That's the method and the plan!” IX This the path that leads to riches, All the yawning purse to fill; Measure scant and weight deficient Are the helpers of the till. Poverty's a crime detested By the virtuous of To-day; All the world conspires to shun it, Though Hypocrisy gainsay. X But the storm of vengeance rumbles On the fore-front of the sky; There is conscience in the people, And 'twill waken by-and-by. Many a noble tower will totter, Many a lofty head lie low, Ere the storm has spent its fury; Woe is coming, sure, if slow! XI Virtue is not dead or buried, It shall rouse itself anon; Truth, though wounded, is immortal, And though lagging, marches on; Sunlight, though obscure or hidden, Sheds from heaven its heavenly ray; Darkness shall not last for ever; Storm shall sweep the fogs away! A PREDICTION TO BE VERIFIED. I Come but one burst of generous alarm, When England's foes combine to do her wrong, Then will our stagnant people, dull but strong, Rise in their countless multitudes to arm! Determined, self-reliant and blood-warm, To guard the freedom we have cherished long! Come but one blast of anger, that inspires A noble nation to arise and act And guard the heritage intact As they received it from their valiant sires; And Britain, mindful of a sacred fact, Will keep alive the consecrated fires Of wisely ordered Liberty and Right— The world's example and its guiding light. II Come but the direst storm and stress that Fate Can bring upon us in its darkest hour, Then will the realm awake, however late, From the warm sloth in which we yawn and cower, And pass our sordid lives in greed, or mate With animal delights in luxury's bower: Then will the ancient virtues bloom anew, And love of country quench the love of gold; Then will the mocking spirits that imbue Our daily converse fade like misty cold, When the clear sunshine permeates the blue And men be manly as in the days of old, And scorn the base delights that sink them down Into the languid waters where they drown. III Peace is a blessing, war may be a curse; But peace with foul dishonour is a crime, And when it breeds corruption, is far worse Than war's excess, that lasts but for a time. War is but justice, waged in self-defence, And first of duties under wise control, While peace maintained by coward false pretence Is poison to the body and the soul. The soldier fighting in his country's cause, The trader gorging a dishonest till, Are the two polar points of good and ill, The Zenith and the Nadir of our laws: Better to perish in heroic fire Than wallow swine-like in polluting mire. THE OLD AND NEW ORACLES. I. The oracles are not dumb, The old responses come Vaguely without control To the inquiring soul That humbly seeks to know How the world-currents flow; Dodona is not mute, Sounds as of harp and lute Float from the tree-tops high As the wild wind wanders by, And to the mind attunes In melancholy runes The music of the spheres Unheard of mortal ears. II. The oracles, as of yore, Whisper for evermore To the sadly questioning brain; But not for ever in vain, As the fancies of a dream That perish ere they gleam. In transitory light Full on our human sight Ever God's angels fly Betwixt the earth and sky, And cast from their snow-white wings The shadows of earthly things. III. Still do the oracles tell Secrets ineffable To the spirit that would stray Out of the bonds of clay To search into the hidden For knowledge unforbidden, Except to the impure, Unfitted to endure The agony and stress Of too much happiness. IV. The oracles as of old Have tidings to unfold To the unpresuming wise, Who accept God's mysteries Of Life and Love and Death With firm enduring faith, Who patiently await At the sill of the sacred gate To hear the anthems pour'd In the temple of the Lord, And the long-drawn solemn chants Of the white-robed hierophants Standing before the shrine In an ecstasy divine! V. Faint though the oracles be As the sigh of a placid sea, Or the glimmer of the dawn Ere the veil of night be drawn, They carol in the floods, They whisper in the woods, They smile in the vernal flowers, They breathe in the summer bowers, They ripple in the streams, They flash in the lightning gleams, They shine in the myriad stars From all their fiery cars, And tell that beneath the sun Justice is ever done, However cruel and long May seem the run of wrong, And that all earth and heaven above Live in God's land of light and love! PERENNIAL DAISIES. The tender blossoms of the Spring Fade ere the Summer birds take wing, The Summer blooms find Autumn tombs; But hardier daisies, bright and clear, Gleam in the meadows all the year. The rose that blossoms red in June, The lily pale as young May moon, They live their day and pass away Before the autumnal tints appear; But daisies blossom all the year. The Winter storms may mar our mirth, And with white mantle robe the earth; But down below the sheltering snow We find the daisies, if we peer,— God bless the darlings of the year! THE SWING ON THE APPLE TREE AT FERN DELL. I It stands, no beauty, on the lawn, Though beautiful to me, The rugged, crooked, gnarly, stunted Blossoming apple tree. I love to see it rich with blooms As white as the feathery snow, For it ripens thoughts as well as apples Out of the long ago! II Twelve summers down the gulf of Time— It seems but yesterday— I made a swing from its sturdiest boughs In a morn of merry May; And from it swung my love, my life, In the flush of her sunny youth, And woo'd and won her to be my bride, With all her love and truth. III And now I swing another as fair, Her years are nearly ten; And she laughs and sings and shouts, “Papa! Swing me again! again!' And I swing her again and kiss her. “Don't kick at the stars!” I cry. And she chuckles with laughter, and says, “I will, If you'll swing me up as high!” IV Gnarly, crooked, rugged, wrinkled Blossoming apple bough! I do not know in the wide, wide world A tree so fair as thou; Three lives, three loves, three spirits haunt Thy boughs, thou beautiful tree! And thy fruits are the thoughts of bygone days That will never return to me! ÆOLIAN MUSIC. O'er the loose strings of the Æolian harp Float the wild melodies like straws on streams,— Songs without words, but full of thoughts and meanings, Though evanescent all as fancy's dreams; Songs of soft sadness, as if angels, weeping, Sighed for the woes of hapless humankind, Foredoomed to sorrow and to hopeless error, Perverse and wayward, obstinate and blind. I hear them at my casement, half asleep, And weave them to my fancy as they skim Lightly as breezes o'er a placid deep, And fancy fashions them into a hymn, Half praise and half lament, and melting slowly In happy thought and tender melancholy. A THOUGHT BY THE DEEP SEA. I As I sat athinking by the deep, deep sea, I wished my thoughts could fly Like autumn seeds, by the wild winds blown, To root beneath the sky, Each in the fulness of the time To grow into a tree, Under whose branches men might sit Happy and wise and free, And war should trouble the earth no more, With its guilt and misery;— II For if my dreams could grow into facts, They should run o'er the wide world's span, And ancient lies that had governed the world Since Time its course began, Should fade away in the light of day And cease to darken the mind, Or harden, pervert, and lead astray The conscience of mankind; And light should pierce through dungeons' doors, And open the eyes of the blind. III Lawyers and soldiers should lose their trade For want of work to be done, And deadly struggles for daily bread Should cease beneath the sun; Food for the hungry should be as free As the water and the air, Or the wholesome light of the liberal noon, Or the moonlight streaming fair, And the weakest brother, no more forlorn, Should have a strong man's share. IV Love born of knowledge should be the guide To lead the world aright, And priestcraft should no more obscure Religion's holy Light; Each truth sublime that Jesus taught, Rejected or ignored By more than half the teeming world, Despised if not abhorred, Should in its heavenly purity Be followed and adored. V All this should happen if my thought Could shape the world anew, And make mankind forsake the false To reverence the true; But if it be a barren seed, And only born to die, And never fated to take root Under a favouring sky, My thought is pleasant while it lasts, And in its light live I! THREE GREAT WORDS: Liberty—Equality—Fraternity. I. Let History teach what Liberty has done, As men conceive it, underneath the sun, What shameless deeds of tyranny and wrong Wrought on the weak by malice of the strong, When Licence, wielder of the sword and flame, Has taken Freedom's desecrated name, And called on Rapine, Anarchy, and War To drive o'er earth her blood-polluted car. Word! idle word! which each man understands In his own cause, and aids with heart and hands, But fails to feel when others would proclaim The right to thwart him—though the right's the same. Freedom to think! Let centuries attest What blood has stained the struggle and the quest To wrench the noblest liberty of all From grasp of priests, and worse than kingly thrall, The rack, the stake—the agonising death, As Roland witnessed with her dying breath. II. Divine Fraternity! 'tis yet unborn, To rule, to guide, to cheer a world forlorn; In the first dawn of Time's recorded hours When mournful Adam quitted Eden's bowers, And three men only walked the Earth's young sod, Cain killed his brother for the love of God. So in the eternal omnipresent Now, In every region where the Fates allow Men to exist, their frantic hosts combine To slay their fellows for a frontier line, For fancied wrong, for visionary right, And seek no umpire but the arm of Might— Might, sole reliance of the wrath of kings Or wilder mobs, when hate or passion stings To treat all alien peoples as their foes, And rule and ruin all who'd dare oppose. III. All men are equal in the sight of Heaven To sin and suffer and to be forgiven, But not all equal on the teeming Earth, Where Nature stamps diversity at birth, Gives this man skill and energy to rule, And that but wit enough to be a fool; Gives this man strength to struggle to the end And make each doubtful circumstance his friend, And that man only weight enough to sink In shallow waters on a dangerous brink! Laws may decide all equal in their sight, But Fate the master acts in Law's despite: It heaves the mountain upward from the plain, It crowns with billows the quiescent main, And from the crowd that grovels in the mire Raises the few and prompts them to aspire To seize pre-eminence for good or ill And mould the weaker fellows to their will. Great are the Words, and worthy to be taught To men and nations to inspire their thought;— But though they charm the philanthropic mind, They're dreams alone—and cheats of humankind! A DREAM OF FAIR OCCASIONS. I In the darkening shades of twilight, As I wandered, sore distraught, Griefs and woes of days departed Surged unbidden on my thought, Joys and sorrows intermingled In the memories of the Past, Fair occasions lost and vanished, All too beautiful to last. II Suddenly between my vision And the lurid setting sun I beheld a troop of shadows Dimly rising one by one; But though filmy, vague and shapeless, Loose and thin and undefined, Gathering form and seeming substance In the rushing of the wind. III Gradually in human semblance, Draped in robes of trailing mist, I could trace their pallid features In the moonlight, now uprist; Silently they fluttered past me, Each with warning hand upraised, Long and lank and bare and skinny, Pointing at me as I gazed. IV Well I knew them ! friends and lovers I had scorned in days of yore, Unobservant and ungrateful For the blessings that they bore: Blessings, promises and chances All by kindly Fortune planned, To be moulded to my purpose And be fashioned by my hand. V Fortune, fame, dominion, glory, Friendship, love, and peace of mind, They had brought for my acceptance Had I known what they designed; But I saw not, and neglected, Heedless 'mid the whirl of life, Lured by pleasure, swayed by passion, In the never-ending strife. VI Blinded by misleading splendours, Prodigal of strength and youth, Late my weary eyes were opened To the knowledge of the truth That I'd wasted life's young morning And the noontime, past return, Burning up the years and leaving Nought but ashes in the urn. VII For a moment, as I sadly Gazed and wondered, every face Of the pallid ghosts and phantoms Seemed to glow with youthful grace, And to woo me to caress them As I might in life's young prime Have caressed a radiant maiden, My heart's goddess for the time. VIII And I called in plaintive accents, “Stay, ye fair ones, stay! oh, stay, I am wiser, I am better, Than in youth's departed day. I have learned from Sorrow's teaching Priceless truths too long unknown; Stay and guide and shape the future, O my beautiful! mine own!” IX Suddenly to gloom relapsing And evanishing from sight, They were lost amid the darkness Of the melancholy night, And I heard, as they departed, Fitful on the winds that bore, Mournful voices, whispering faintly, “Lost! oh, lost for evermore!” AT THE BALL AND IN THE GRAVE. In the Ball-room. The spring-time loveliness decays Ere the cold autumnal days, The petals of the lily Fade ere the nights grow chilly, And rose leaves fall before the year is old, Or the gay green turns to russet gold; And such, alas! is living beauty's doom, When age creeps over it to blight its bloom. In the Grave. But the calm beauty of the sacred dead Lost to our loving hearts, in life's young prime, Remains for ever in our thought, With tenderest recollection fraught, Defiant of the touch of Time, Although the hostile seasons pass Fond memory's magic glass, Preserves the lovely features unimpaired, And adds angelic grace To the belov'd and unforgotten face Preserved by Death, though Life would not have spared! SMALL, BUT GREAT. One moment in a thousand years, One raindrop in the sea, One dewy daisy in the grass, One leaf upon the tree, One grain of sand upon the shore, And in the awful sky One planet 'mid a million suns That gem the galaxy,— Are links in One eternal chain That measures Space and Time, The greatest small—the smallest great, And equally sublime: Thoughts in the infinite Mind of God, That knows nor great nor small, Who formed and governs them in Love, And sanctifies them all! OUR WANTS FOR THE CHILDREN. I What do we want for the children? We want a nobler race Than ever since the birth of Time Made earth their dwelling-place. Clear brain, fleet foot, strong hand, bright eye, And heart and soul and mind, And better lives and higher aims, For suffering humankind. II We want the fresh and flowing streams, Not gutters of the town— The acorns of the living oak, And not the thistledown; We want the gold, and not the slag— The garden bright and fair, And not the poisonous morass And the pestilential air. III We want the swarming children To be well and wisely taught: Not in the book of hostile creeds, But in the book of thought; Not only in what mind requires, But what the body needs And the State expects if it would rear Brave hearts for noble deeds. IV All this we want for the children,— Self-knowledge wisely planned, And not forlorn theologies Too vague to understand; We want them to be strong and true In the holiness of work, To save them from the awful streets Where the crime and the fever lurk. V We want still more for the children,— We want them to be born Of Love, not Lust that breeds and rots In the festering slums forlorn; We want the fresh and wholesome shoots Of the orchard and the vine, And not the stunted undergrowth, Or the clover for the kine. VI Brave boys, good girls, for the coming years— 'Tis these that we require, And these we'll win though we pierce our way Through persecuting fire; And though the triumph may be slow, The victory shall be won, For God and man and heaven and earth Combine to see it done. IN PRAISE OF DISCONTENT. I. Ever, for ever, without pause Or change for better or for worse, Act and react the natural laws And forces of the universe; They fill eternity and space, And guide the courses of the stars; They keep the sun in his appointed place, And curb the comets in their cars. Here, on this little crust that men call earth, There's not a wind on land or sea In all its rolling girth, Or leaf that trembles on the tree, But yields obedience to the laws divine, Which cause the flowers to bloom, the stars to shine. II. The laws that regulate the mind And shape the purpose of mankind Are universal even as they, And rule the human will With irresistible sway For stedfast good or transitory ill. Mighty as gravitation, that controls The motion of the docile spheres, Are Love and Discontent in human souls To stir men's hopes and fears. Love fills the earth with living multitudes, That, but for Discontent, heaven-born, Would roam as naked in the sheltering woods As the wild animals forlorn, Heedless as noontide midges on the wing Of coming morrows and the wants they bring; But Discontent, the tyrant and the friend, Plays its allotted part and destined end, And gives weak man the strength and skill To plough the fields and sow the seed and till For future needs the kindly mother soil That yields the harvests to reward his toil. III. 'Tis Discontent that nerves his arm to slay The ravenous beasts that hunger for their prey, And rob them of their skins for dress To cover and adorn his nakedness; 'Tis Discontent that guides him to the fold For fleece to shield him from the winter cold. Without its wholesome aid No cities born of civilising trade Would gem the land or tempt him to forsake The tangled wild-wood or the sheltering brake; No palaces or towers Or high cathedrals eloquent in stone Would lift their pinnacles amid the bowers; No pealing organ tone, Laden with adoration, would be heard Competing with the melancholy moan Of waving wood or ocean tempest stirred; No ships with venturous keel would sail afar Freighted with lofty hopes and mingling fears In search of land beneath the southern star And undiscovered hemispheres, To be in fulness of the fateful hour The chosen centres of imperial power, The nurseries of Science, Learning, Art, And Piety, Religion's better part,— All this and more, as yet concealed From human sight, however keen its ray, Undreamed of, unimagined, unrevealed, Till the ripe dawn of God's appointed day Shall yet be born of Love and Discontent Shaped to good end, for evil never meant. MY SEASONABLE VISITORS. Come, childhood, come! and banish all my sadness With pleasant laughter, born of artless mirth; Come like the spring-time in its budding gladness, And all the future promise of the earth. Come, lusty manhood, looking forward ever! Come like the summer with its golden grain; Come with the genial sunshine of endeavour, With cooling dews and fertilising rain. Come with the silver sprinkles in thy hair, Thou who art passing westward with the sun; Bring thy autumnal fruitage rich and rare, And ripened vintage of brave duty done. Come, venerable age, with wintry head Calmly reposing after fitful strife, Far onward on the path that all must tread, To the bright gateway of eternal life. Come one, come all; ye are welcome to my heart, Whate'er the season of your years may be; Come to my hopeful spirit, and impart The warmth and light of human sympathy! THE DOUBLE LIFE OF A RIGID SABBATARIAN. A Portrait. He has two souls, two consciences, two creeds,— One, seldom used, he keeps for Sunday needs, Like his new coat and hat and snow-white shirt, Without a stain or speck of visible dirt; The other serves him for his daily rule, To keep his footing in the world's hard school, And teach him that his pious seventh-day face And affectation of religious grace Need not restrain him on the other six In lies and frauds and Trade's nefarious tricks; And so he strives with all the strength he can To cheat in semblance of an honest man, And thinks it lawful for a knave to fill His greedy pockets and remorseless till By means unthought of in his Sunday prayers— Short weight, short measure, and adulterate wares! He cares not! No! not he! 'Tis gilded sin. Let losers groan!—but let those laugh that win! He is the winner; and when Sundays come Goes thrice to church, looks reverently glum, And, humbly kneeling, vows to sin no more; But Monday sees him as he was before! LINES. All the materials are the same, Of blackest things and whitest, Carbon and diamonds are but one, And dewdrops glittering in the sun Are gems when they are brightest; Base vinegar and noble wine Are both the children of the vine; And Love and Hate, if we but knew, Are quite as often one, as two. But woe is me! the bravest things Are commonest of any; Much charcoal may be scattered round, But diamond gems are seldom found, Though sought by very many. Love's roses flourish on the tree Where Hatred's thorns grow fresh and free; The thorns are many to the view, The roses beautiful—but few! THE AFTERMATH. The first crop has been garnered, A crop of hopes and fears, Of ecstasies and transports, And passionate sighs and tears. It grew in fields Elysian In youth's delicious day, And filled my hands with fruits and flowers, And all the pomps of May. The aftermath was richer far In gifts of priceless worth, Grown in the fertile places Of kindly Mother Earth. It brought divine fulfilment To all the hopes of youth, And sympathy in sorrow, And never-failing truth. The first crop sprang in meadows, With clover for the kine; The second was of purple grapes, To yield the noble wine; The little germs of happy love That slumbered in the sod Grew into vineyards on the hills, Full in the smile of God! HATE. Didst thou ever say “I hate” To any man or small or great? Retract! retract! Thou art not wise!— If thou canst hate, disdain, despise A child, a woman or a man, Thy heart's to blame—thou'rt out of plan! The sunlight falls on high and low, And the rain rains, the rivers flow With bounty ever large and free, For bad and good, for land and sea: Strive to be like them, if thou canst. So shall thy virtues be enhanced, If thou art virtuous, even in part, And pure in purpose as in heart. Hate, if thou wilt, the wrong that's wrought, But not the doer, wrongly taught; And in extremity of ill Remember that he's human still! THE STATUE IN THE PARK AT BRUSSELS. There it stands in the mellow moonlight, Just as it stood in the long ago, When I was a boy, brimful of fancies And passionate thoughts—Love's overflow; My trysting-place with a fair young damsel— Of poor estate, I ween, was she; But a goddess of beauty to my young fancy, And now—a light in my memory! THE MIGHTY GUN AND THE LITTLE PEN. Great conqueror Gun and peaceful Pen Discourse together now and then;— Once in a dream, a waking trance, By day or night—by day, perchance— I heard them boasting, each to each, In plain intelligible speech, Of deeds accomplished or begun; And to my fancy thus spoke Gun:— “'Tis I that rule and give the law To keep the multitudes in awe; The empires of the world are mine: I govern them by right divine, The right of strength by Heaven decreed To shape the will, to form the deed; 'Tis I keep order in the realms When civil conflict overwhelms, And quench in blood, if needs must be, The furious fires of Anarchy; I lead the nations gone astray Back to the safe appointed way; I keep within the bound of rules The lust of conquerors and fools, Who'd strew the earth with human bones, On which to build them crazy thrones, Did not a mightier force than theirs Exist behind them unawares. Wer't not for me the world would roll Back in the ruts of uncontrol, Without a master or a guide To stem the fierce barbaric tide, When men were wild as beasts of prey, The naked lords of every day, Who took no heed at set of sun Of what the cruel day had done, And on the morrow worked their will, Whether to plunder or to kill, Without a law but might and main, Or any conscience to restrain. I am a tyrant, understand, But rather to be blessed than banned; For, benefactor in disguise, Where'er I rule I civilise.” “Thou'rt great, no doubt, when all is done,” Said little Pen to mighty Gun; “Thou'rt lord of how and where and when To shape the destinies of men, But canst not overstep thy part, Or reason with the human heart; Thou hast thy limits, well defined, Thou'rt not the master of the mind. I, little I, unseen, unheard, Work my own wonders by a word; I foil obstruction by a thought, And give it wings, with lightnings fraught, To strike the battlements of wrong, And hurl them down, however strong. Thy thunders perish in their birth, Mine make the circuit of the earth, Conversing with the time to come, For ages after thou art dumb. Thou buildest empires huge and high, That flourish for a day and die, And leave nor trace nor heritage, Except a line on history's page, A line, a word, a lie perchance, For idle Rumour to enhance! But I build empires to endure On Truth's foundations firm and pure, Deep laid in thoughts beyond control, And as eternal as the soul. In vain thy thunderbolts are hurl'd, Thoughts are the rulers of the world, And shape the destinies of men,— And all my work!” said little Pen. SPIN-SONG OF THE FATES. I Spinning, ever spinning, 'Mid the moil and strife; Spinning, spinning, spinning,— Such the law of life. Swaddling clothes for new-born child, Bridal robes for maiden mild, Winding-sheets for Age and Pain— Such the industrious Fates ordain, As they turn th' eternal wheel, With a rush and roar, Spinning, spinning, spinning, Spinning evermore. II Spinning, ever spinning, Day and night and morrow; Spinning, spinning, spinning Webs of joy and sorrow. Warp and woof and selfsame thread For the living and the dead. All the patterns in the loom, Deftly drawn by hand of Doom, As revolves th' eternal wheel, With a rush and roar; Spinning, spinning, spinning, Spinning evermore! THE MANNERS OF THE AGE. I There's blight on the social harvest!— On the women and on the men, Blight on the little children, Blight on the tongue and pen! The blush on the cheek of beauty Gives place to a stony stare, And the eyes of the matrons utter What the tongue may not declare. II Men's ancient courage withers In a burning thirst for pelf; And they lose the love of virtue In a baseless love of self. The brave deeds of their fathers No longer win esteem, And float from dim remembrance Like the bubbles on a stream. III The minds of the little children Are fed on husks and straws, Or barren stalks of logic, And dull scholastic laws; And they lose the artless credence That won our hearts to see, And climb no more confiding To the maternal knee. IV And mothers neglect to suckle The innocent babes they bear, Lest they should lose enjoyment In the stalls of Vanity Fair, And hand them over to hirelings To drain unnatural milk, While they go flaunting and flirting In diamonds and in silk. V Grown old before their season, The striplings lie and cheat, And talk the slang of the gutter, Or scrawl vile words in the street; And the little maids learn lessons, In the paths where they should not tread, Pernicious and untimely, Unfit for heart or head. VI The blight of the scanty knowledge That fancies it is great, And flatters fools with the notion That they can rule the State, Pervades the ignorant many, Who think they're wise as the few, And that the false and cowardly Should govern the brave and true. VII The pens of the ready writers Pollute the teeming page With fond and foul descriptions Of the vices of the age; And the pulpits every Sunday Denounce the crimes of the poor, But keep discreetly silent When wealth is the evildoer. VIII The blight! the blight! the blight! It stretches over all; And the social mildew fastens Alike on the great or small, Till the growing corn droops rotten In the fields of human thought, And the stubble itself proves worthless, And the harvest comes to nought. IX Must the blight endure for ever? Shall the healthy storm not burst, When the atmosphere grows heavy With the vapours it has nursed? Already the lightning flashes On the far horizon's cope, And the coming tempest rumbles!— We watch; and wait; and hope! A MODERN PHILOSOPHER. I He turns to heaven his dull grey eyes, He opes his mouth in pompous wise, And lets his measured accents fall, Dull, cold and mathematical, While he expounds his theories. II He thinks he maps the human heart With all its windings on his chart, And knows, or fancies that he knows, The secret source of all our woes, And the true remedy to start. III He talks of Nature and her laws, Of Man, the Mind, the Great First Cause, Demand, Supply, Life, Death, Increase, The over-fruitfulness of Peace, And argues on them clause by clause. IV He thinks it time if truth were said That mouths too many to be fed Swarm in an over-populous land; And that a fool might understand That stupid peasants should not wed. V He thinks it right that, for the sake Of lands with large domains at stake, The common people should not breed More plenteously than they can feed, And that coition's a mistake. VI If vulgar people, boors and clowns, And riff-raff of our teeming towns, Would, when they mate, produce but two, To take their place in season due, Philosophy might spare its frown! VII But, in default of this, he swears That none should wed but rich men's heirs, And that the common herds of man Should eat as little as they can, And die unmated in their cares. VIII 'Tis Lust, he thinks, that rules the earth, And gives its extra millions birth; “Is it not strange,” he proudly cries, “That I alone should be so wise As to proclaim, for what it's worth, IX “The mighty truth not taught in schools That half the human race are fools, And that all wisdom dwells with me To save them from their misery, If they'd be governed by my rules? X “Alas! they grovel in dull ease, And breed like maggots in a cheese, And never learn that war and pest And famine must do God's behest, And stay their perilous increase. XI “Great are my plans! I'd loose and bind The laws of body and of mind, And so restore the golden age When war and pest should cease to rage And thin the numbers of mankind; XII “When men, and wiser women too, Should curb the passions and subdue; And calm and temperate and just, Should make it felony to lust, And children should be strong—but few.” XIII This is his dogma and pretence, The law, he says, of Common Sense; But yet, with wife and children blest, He breeds for pastime like the rest, And sternly preaches abstinence, XIV And prophesies in prose and rhyme The speedy coming of the time When Pestilence in bower and town Shall mow the human harvest down, And War shall cease to be a crime! XV And when, if children of the slum In midge-like millions still should come, Infanticide should be allowed To ease the pressure of the crowd, And hasten the Millennium! XVI The public hoots him—nought cares he, But pities its perversity; Or, swathed in armour of conceit, He warns the senate and the street For scorning his Philosophy! IN A THUNDERSTORM. Let keen-eyed Science teach us what she can, The vast Incomprehensible confronts us still; She strives to grope her way through Nature's plan, And solve the hidden mysteries at her will. Sitting at her window barred, She turns her glances, cold and hard, Up to the starry vault of heaven, And fancies that to her is given To pierce the secrets hidden from the ken Of the grovelling herd of men; But Intuition tells us more than she, In echoes wafted from afar Faintly and dimly from the infinity In which we float, much wondering where we are; There are more thoughts in Childhood's heart Than subtlest Reason can impart, Or proud Philosophy explain From all the heights it can attain. So when the awful thunders crash Obedient to the lightning flash, My childish faith returns; I deem I hear The voice of God proclaiming from the sphere That Retribution follows Crime In its due appointed time, Slow and precarious though it seems to be To our weak eyes, that cannot see Beyond the limits of the hour That comes and goes ere we have felt its power To shape to-morrow's purpose through the gloom, That hides the coming certainty of doom. There are far deeper lessons in the soul Than Science can presume to teach By rule and logical control, However loftily they preach. Cling to me, O ye instincts of my youth! Shadows, it may be, of Eternal Truth! BLESSINGS IN DISGUISE. Milton and Beethoven. I Milton sits musing in the porch, The bright blue sky above him; But cannot see the light of Heaven, Or smiles of those who love him. But though the utter darkness hides The earthly from his vision, He sees the bowers of Paradise And splendours of the Elysian; He learns from angels at his side Creation's awful story, And looks upon them face to face, Undazzled by their glory. II Beethoven—Music's great high-priest, Whose heaven-born fancies capture The tangled skeins of harmony And weave them into rapture— Hears not the voice of humankind, Nor sound of life or motion, Nor tempests on the echoing hill, Nor moan of restless ocean; And yet in silence of his mind Can hear the throb and thunder Of jubilant hymns and solemn chants, And lays of love and wonder. III Thus, though relentless Fate may close The gateways of our senses, Immortal spirit overleaps Its barriers and defences, And with celestial recompense For harm and loss diurnal Yields greater joy than Flesh affords,— A foretaste of th' Eternal: To blind old Milton's rayless orbs The light divine is given,— And deaf Beethoven hears the hymns And harmonies of heaven! THE TWO SLAIN GENERALS. I In the cold and drear December, In the waning of the night, A vision passed before me By the dim, uncertain light: A vision of hosts and armies Battling for wrong—or right. II Ten times ten thousand warriors Were ranged on either side, In squadrons and battalions Deploying far and wide; Ghosts of departed heroes That had bled and fought and died. III Dull in the mist, their banners Hung hueless every one; There came no breath of sulphur From the jaws of the murderous gun, And the swords and spears and rifles Were shadowless in the sun. IV It seemed as if legion to legion Inquired with anxious eyes, Why did we hate each other? How did this strife arise? And why did this misery happen Under God's holy skies? V The serried ranks reopened In dim and dark array, And the pale ghost of a hero Slain in the fateful fray, Astride on a spectral charger, Stood forth in the dawning day. VI And from the opposing phalanx Another, like to him In shadowy form and feature And resolute eye and limb, As if leading hosts to battle, Loomed large in the fog-light dim. VII And the one said to the other, “General, we died in vain In the quarrel which we sought not; And the blood of thousands slain Cries up to outraged Heaven From the gory battle-plain. VIII “Brother in crime and sorrow, Brother in fearful wrong, The foolish crowd exalt us With plaudits loud and long, And chant out praises daily In sermon and in song. IX “They call us great and mighty, Because by passion led We sought to gather glory In the vineyards of the dead, And cared not for the rivers Of innocent blood we shed; X “Because we rushed to battle To struggle in a cause That might have marched to triumph Amid the world's applause, If men had been obedient To God's eternal laws.” XI “Ay,” said his brother warrior, “The victory was not worth The smoke of the powder wasted In heralding its birth, Or the blood of the meanest soldier That sank into the earth: XII “But man is a cruel tyrant, The foe of his brother-man; Pitiless and remorseless, By impulse and by plan,— Is, and for ever has been, Since Time its course began, XIII “On all who strive to thwart him In the frenzy of his need, In his hunger of dominion, In his hate of a rival creed, Or love of a neighbour's frontier, That tempts his selfish greed. XIV “And we became his hirelings, And pandered to his lust, Helping to wreak his vengeance, Unreasoning and unjust, On our offending brothers, And harmless fellow-dust. XV “Let us be friends, my brother.” And I saw, with moistening eyes, That they clasped their hands together As the mists began to rise, And the shadowy legions vanished In the light of the morning skies. ON THE PLACE DE LA CONCORDE, PARIS. I Lone wandering through the street With desultory feet, Led by wild fancies idly to and fro, I lingered on the square So awful yet so fair, Misnamed of Concord, where no concords grow: The founts had ceased to play, The mist hung dark and grey, And clad the spectral trees, like mourners robed for woe. II Upon the Seine's dark breast The ripples were at rest— There blew no wind to curl them on the stream; The city was asleep, The very mist did creep As if 'twere drowsy, and each lamp's dim beam, Athwart the dreary night, Shone out with nebulous light, Ring-circled, vague and thick—a melancholy gleam. III Whole phalanxes of ghosts, In long-drawn shadowy hosts, Headless and horrible, usurped the ground, That seemed alive with Death; Without a sigh or breath To break the pulseless quietude around, In the cathedral tower The solemn midnight hour Shook, whispering with a faint and muffled sound. IV I saw before me pass, As in a magic glass, A mournful spectre looming through the haze; Upon his brow he wore The semblance, red as gore, Of a king's crown, the gaud of other days, Such as might well beseem The glory and the dream Of lost dominion and the people's praise. V Where Luxor's giant stone Stands awful and alone A scaffold reared its grim revengeful head; And round its basements rude A fearful multitude Of fitful ghosts, neither alive nor dead, Paced to the throb and thrum Of the monotonous drum In slow funereal march and melancholy tread. VI And lo! before my sight, In gleams of lurid light, I could discern, as in a palimpsest, The wearer of the crown Kneel reverently down, With pious hands enfolded on his breast, While from his lips a prayer, Borne on the stagnant air, Implored of pitying Heaven the boon of blessed rest. VII The blessing was conferr'd, The mournful prayer was heard, The deed was done, the thread of life was riven; While a voice, calm and low, Hopeful, but full of woe, Said, “Patience, brother! be thy sins forgiven; Angels attend on thee, Death is great victory! “Son of Saint Louis, find thy home in Heaven!” FAILURES. Millions of germs never grow into life, On the land or in the sea; Millions of acorns fall to the ground And never produce a tree; Millions of people live and die On Earth's prolific breast, But scarcely produce in a thousand years A man above the rest, To guide them into higher life Than ever before they knew, To lead them out of the false and bad Into the good and true. And when he comes they heed him not, Or if they heed, they slay For being wiser than themselves And born before his day! THREE DECEIVERS. I When I was young, in lusty health, Two visions floated o'er me,— The one was Fame, the other Wealth, And bright the shore before me, Fair glittering in the morning ray. But ere the noon of youthful day A phantom lovelier than they Stood radiantly beside me. It whispered music, day and night, Its smiles were more than noonday bright, Its eyes were fountains of delight To comfort and to guide me! II 'Twas Love, with witchery on her tongue, Who from her lustrous glances Whole sheaves of feathered arrows flung, Well sharpened with romances. She lured and led me from the bowers, And promised me more blissful hours Than Fame or Wealth and all their dowers Could yield, and never vary. Alas! I yielded to the thrall Of each in turn—in rise and fall— And found they were impostors all, To cheat the heart unwary! III Fame brought Detraction in his train, And Envy strove to spite me, While Wealth, acquired in toil and pain, Was powerless to delight me. Love, though a traitor, like the rest Was far the pleasantest and best, And gave my life a nobler zest Than either of her rivals; And so, if victim I must be, The least unworthy of the three Shall hold my foolish heart in fee, The last of the survivals! HOW MANY AND HOW FEW. I How many raindrops fall in the river, How many rays in the sunshine quiver, How many lovers' vows are broken, How many lies are daily spoken, How many knaves in the morning rise, How many fools are thought to be wise, How many leaves are on the tree, How many gallons in the sea, And how many sorrows oppress the men Who live to threescore years and ten? II Hard to reckon! Easier far To count how few the happy are, Or the vows in Love's bright summer made That are truly kept in the wintry shade, Or the hopes of youth in its blossoming May That ripen to fruit in the autumn day, And the hearts that after years of pain Would choose to live their lives again; Easy to count them if we knew,— O Life, be Love! O Love, be true! THE SECRET. I I found a secret long ago, Before I'd passed my middle prime, To turn a friend into a foe, And blunt the shafts of hostile Time. II To revel in my youthful thought, When cruel age was creeping on; And sail Life's ship with fancies fraught O'er seas where placid summer shone. III How I could bathe in fountains fair For hope and love and healing meant, And breathe the soft and balmy air Of gratitude and sweet content. IV How I could keep my wayward heart Pure as a child's in its morn of life, Nor suffer courage to depart, Or perish in the moil and strife. V How not to creep, but to aspire; How to widen my narrowing ken; How keep alive the sacred fire Of love to God and my fellow-men. VI Yes! I discovered it long ago— The little secret—so large to bless, That lightened the load of every woe, And robed the world in loveliness. VII Wouldst know the secret? Short to tell: You cannot read it in my looks. I found it where it loves to dwell, In the noblest and the best of books: VIII In the holy Sermon on the Mount, In poet's page of lofty truth;— These were the waters of the Fount, These the renewers of my Youth! SONNET. Could we but know, and, knowing, durst proclaim How much the thoughts of an exultant youth Owe to the promptings of eternal Truth Infused into our souls like living flame, The cold and callous world would scorn and blame, Or look upon us with a dull surprise, And call us mad for seeming to be wise Beyond our years, and bid us hush for shame. Alas! we know not, till in after time Too late to profit by, too fitful bright; Though wild and vague, too near to the sublime, Were the ennobling thoughts by Fancy drawn Unwittingly for Heaven to give us light In the fresh sunrise of our mortal dawn! WHAT THE MORNING SUN SAID TO THE FLOWERS. Ye happy, beautiful and innocent things, God's only angels in a world of pain, Angels in all except the snowy wings To float and soar o'er heaven's eternal plain, Sin casts no shadow o'er your radiant faces, And grief avoids your holy dwelling-places; Ye live, ye love, ye propagate and die, And ope your joyous petals to the sky, Rose-red and lily pale and heavenly blue, And bask in my warm beams from morns till eves, To drink the cooling moisture of the dew That freshens and sustains your drooping leaves; Your lives are free from sorrow, sin and care, And ye are happy knowing ye are fair— Happier than birds or beasts or humankind Or insects, happier still than all that wage Insensate wars with instinct fierce and blind Against their fellow-creatures, to assuage The cruel and relentless hunger-pains That rouse their passions and inflame their veins; But ye! ye innocent nurslings of my rays, Live purer lives and sanctify the earth, Which ye adorn by your perennial birth And generous loveliness of summer days, When ye display your beauties to the light In manifold glories to man's grateful sight. Ye break no laws, ye live unsullied hours, And feel no pangs of sorrow in the bowers, Inflicting none! and only spreading pleasures To all who prize your ever-teeming treasures. Born of my beams, I love you every one, Gems of the earth and darlings of the sun! CIRCLES. All the worlds exist in circles; In a circle blows the wind, In a circle flows the life-blood, And in circles acts the mind: On and on, and on for ever, Travelling east we reach the west; Suns and galaxies and systems All obey the same behest, Never swerving into tangents, Never passing into rest. Everything in God's creation, Guided by a law Divine, Is imprisoned in a circle, And knows nothing of a line. God alone extends for ever Through the past infinity, Through the present to the future, Is and was and is to be— Lives unending, unbeginning, Mystery of mystery! ELOGE DE LA FOLIE. Not by Erasmus. I Some sing of wisdom and its charms In tuneful melancholy, But I will choose another theme, And sing the praise of Folly. Folly's the ruler of the world, As history evinces; The bosom friend, the confidant And counsellor of princes. II When statesmen meet in senate halls To plan the fate of nations, Close at their elbows Folly flits To shape their disputations. It whispers in their willing ears, Unseen and unsuspected, And shapes their actions into forms Which Wisdom had rejected. III There's not a potentate on earth So mighty in dominion As Folly, master of the wise And tyrant of opinion. 'Tis Folly keeps the world alive In all its generations, And sits as arbiter of fate And umpire of the nations. IV 'Tis Folly makes us fall in love When health and youth run riot, And keeps the bright steel blade of mind From mouldiness and quiet; 'Tis Folly makes us rush to war And pour out blood like water, And all for glory and renown To be acquired by slaughter. V 'Tis Folly makes the wine-cup flow When joyous comrades revel, And drags the stupid and the wise Down to a common level; 'Tis Folly shouts hip, hip! hurrah! With voice enthusiastic, When lies come rattling from the tongue In praise encomiastic. VI 'Tis Folly makes us think that gold All other good surpasses, And value the applause of crowds Though it be brayed of asses; 'Tis Folly that depends on luck, And not upon endeavour, To feed the fires of enterprise And keep them hot for ever. VII 'Tis Folly makes the millions cheer By self-sufficient warrant, When statesmen gifted with the “gab” Pour out their windy torrent, And take five weary hours to tell What might be better ended In twice five minutes, with less risk To common-sense offended. VIII 'Tis Folly wakes the slumbering world And sets it briskly going, And keeps life's fashionable stream For ever fresh and flowing. So long live Folly! guide of man Since time's remotest ages, The sovereign of the multitude And mentor of the sages! POPULARITY. He hit the bad taste of the silly and thoughtless, The silly and thoughtless rewarded him well; The critics encored him, the maidens adored him— Whatever he published was certain to sell. The multitude bought him, the publishers sought him, Who could compare with him? Who could excel? One who excelled him by ten times ten thousand, Sang for the wise and the good and the true; Thought them majority, found them minority, Friendly and loving, but hopelessly few. How could he count with his butcher and baker? How could he live upon sunshine and dew? The bard of the silly splashed by in his chariot— His was the homage and his the acclaim; The bard of the thoughtful trudged by in the gutter, And looked to the future for profitless fame. What does it signify?—Man can but live and die: Living, he's nobody; dead, he's a Name! KILLING THE TIME. I Kill Time? And why should I kill him? I want him to be my friend, To live with him and cherish him In the fast-approaching end; To roam with me in the wild wood, To pluck the wayside flowers, Or sit with me and my loved one In the leafy summer bowers. II Kill Time? But why should I kill him, My friend all friends beside, When he can teach me wisdom To comfort me and guide, When he can strew my pathway With lily and thyme and rose, And lilac and laburnum, And any blossom that grows? III Kill him? Why should I kill him, In the sight of the chiding sun, In ignorant self-slaughter, When he and my life are one, When kindly Heaven deputes him To cheer me on the road, Not darksome altogether, That leads me up to God? IV Kill him? Ah, no! I'll bless him, And study him all I can: He's not my foe, nor ever was Though all his little span; He brings me gifts from day to day, And 'mid the moil and strife Of the busy world, where Death is lord, He holds me on to life. V 'Twould be ungrateful and unjust If I should do him wrong, And, though when oft I think him short, He seems perversely long: The fault lies wholly with myself, And Time is not to blame, Who holds his course, through good and ill, Eternally the same. VI 'Tis true that by all-wise decree He ripens young to old, And dims the light of beaming eyes, And turns the warmth to cold; But that's no reason we should haste The inevitable day, By killing him whose life is ours: I'll use him while I may! THE OLD TREE. There's life in the old tree yet: It opens its buds to the spring, And rustles its leaves to the soft west wind, When the lark and the nightingales sing; It yields the owl a sheltering rest, And the bright-eyed squirrel a run, And casts a shade on the mossy sward Under the noonday sun,— A shade where weariness may rest And indolence may dream, And sweethearts carve their names on the bark, And muse on the joy supreme. There's life in the old tree yet To brave the wintry storm, And pith in its wide-extended roots To keep its branches warm; So let the wild winds blow their worst, Come frost, come hail, come rain, Come anything but the lightning stroke And the weird, wild hurricane,— The tree shall stand for its destined hour, And bloom in the spring again! ONLY STRAWS! The Devil sat at the dawn of day, Amid the crowds on a broad highway, By the bank of a mighty river, That dashed and foamed and rolled for ever, With waves and winds and constant strife— The dark and treacherous River of Life. The teeming people on the shore, Wistfully watching evermore, Gazed on the straws that the Devil cast Into the torrent hurrying past, And with impatient hand and eye, As the worthless waifs went floating by, Strove to catch them in eager haste, Wading naked from the waist, Or in defiant strength and pride Leap'd all headlong into the tide, To seize the straws by the tempter flung To dazzle and cheat the old and young, The weak, the strong, the shy, the bold, By wisps of visionary gold. I asked, unknowing what to think, A keen spectator on the brink, What caused the madness of the crowd. “Madness?” he answered me aloud; “They are not mad, but brave and wise: They know the value of the prize! Straws, did you say? They're great rewards, The best that kindly Earth affords; They're wealth, dominion, power and fame, More precious than the tongue can name. Who gains them makes the world his own, And sits like monarch on a throne, To tower above the common herd, Supreme in action and in word!” He ceased and, darting from my side, Sprang exulting in the tide; Young he was and fair to see, And confident of victory, And 'mid the waters deep and vast Clutched at every straw that passed; And though at times he gasped for breath, He feared no conqueror but Death, And in the struggle took no heed Of his competitors in greed, Who pressed upon him all around: He strove, he struggled, and he drowned, And sank with faint expiring groan Down to the bottom like a stone! His stronger rivals stepped ashore— Pale-faced, dim-eyed, and wearied sore, Old and decrepid ere their time, Or foul of feet with slush and slime, To flaunt the straws which they had won Triumphant to the noonday sun, Or hug them proudly to their breasts, And wear like trophies in their crests. Alas! I thought, that men should be Such dupes and victims as to see A treasure in the worthless straws That win their worship and applause; That in their greed they should despise God's choicest blessings to the wise— Health, strength, and blessed peace of mind, And love, best boon of humankind! Alas! that they should sell their souls For paltry and deluding doles, And shadowy dreams of wealth and power, That cheat them for a fretful hour, And veil from their defrauded sight The glories of the Infinite, And send them to the grave forlorn To weep that they were ever born, Poor little wormlings of the sod, That creep and crawl, and know not God! GUTTERSLUSH: Maker of Parliaments. I Gutterslush, one of the million, Can neither read nor write, But can drink and swagger and bluster, And, if he likes, can fight. He labours for his daily bread, And thinks the toil severe; And spends the better half of his wage In tobacco and in beer. II His wretched, ragged helpmate Works harder far than he, To earn a crust for the starving brats That clamber at her knee Or swarm in the putrid alleys In the puddle and the rain, To pluck up vice in the gutter, Deadening heart and brain. III And Gutterslush is a voter By right of the rent he pays, Or allows his life's poor partner To hoard for the evil days, When the landlord of their dog-hole Might turn them into the street, To howl for coppers to purchase drink On pretence of bread to eat. IV And Gutterslush thinks he's a “thinker,” Because of the paltry vote, That he'd sell to the highest bidder, If only for a groat, To buy the beery poison Or the throat-inflaming gin, And think no shame of the bargain, But clinch it with a grin. V Is he not one of the million That help to rule the State? And choose the men of action— The brave, the true, the great, And aid it to hold the position It held in days bygone, When wisdom sat at its councils And guarded the steps of the throne; VI When fools and knaves and cowards Were ruled, but did not rule, And the teachers were not governed By the dunces of the school; When the doctors, not the patients, Kept peace in Bedlam's halls, And the warders, not the felons, Were the lords in the prison walls? VII Gutterslush looks at the windows Of the all-too-tempting shops, Where the glittering watches dangle, And the diamonds hang in drops Or gloats at the sight of the bacon That might exercise his jaw, If he had not to work and win it Ere it reached his greedy maw. VIII Every man is a foeman (In Gutterslush's eye,) Who wears a better coat on his back Than idleness can buy. And Gutterslush as a voter Is great on election day, When a party-ridden nation Indulges in its craze; IX And accepts the voice of the many As an oracle divine, Though the voice be as void of reason, As the rowt and roar of kine— The mob that is bound to labour, And has not leisure to think, And traders engrossed in trading Hear nought but the money's chink. X Or, closely packed together In the grip of the teeming town, Strive in their desperation To trample each other down, And goaded by fear of hunger, Limit their little skill, To sell by fraudulent measure, And the filling of the till. XI And scruple not to poison The unoffending poor, By the carrion food they sell them At a profit large and sure, To be got from the ready penny In a famishing woman's hand, Who has sold, perchance, her virtue For the pence at her command. XII The Gutterslushes rule us, And surge and overwhelm The buttresses and bulwarks Of a once majestic realm; And take no heed of the rivals, Many and brave and strong, That are springing up around us As the swift years hurry along. XIII And, alas! our would-be statesmen, Floundering in faction's mire, Will walk as their party bids them, Though it lead through flood and fire; Not giving a thought to duty, Or their suffering country's need Of honest men to rule it, In all their thought and deed. XIV If Gutterslush were but One, Small evil might be wrought; But he's part of a swarming million, Unscrupulous and untaught, Though he knows the gospel of greed And every man for himself, And the devil take the hindmost In the dastardly struggle for pelf! XV But the million are the masters Till the destined end shall come, And the court and the camp and the forum Shall be captured by the Slum: Demos is lord and monarch Supreme in bower and town, With a firebrand for a sceptre And a fool's cap for a crown! XVI And Jack is as good as his master, And Jill is the quean of the land, And covers the streets with her children To shame us where we stand. Vox Populi! Vox Stultorum! Are they not the same— Speaking in tones of thunder And devastating flame? OH FOR A MAN! Oh for a man of soul sublime To dwarf the pigmies of our time, Of honest and far-reaching mind, Who sees his way to loose and bind,— A man to act, and not to spout His weary floods of mazy doubt, And flux of words in dark disguise To vex the patience of the wise. Oh for a man of heart and hand, The guiding spirit of the land, To keep intact from knaves and fools And slavish bigots of the schools The glorious privileges won And handed down from sire to son, That made our Britain stand erect, A model for the world's respect, The friend of right, th' oppressor's dread, The heart of freedom and its head! Oh for a man to write his name Clear on the luminous scroll of fame, A man of purpose, strength and wit, Like brave old Palmerston and Pitt, To foil the cowardly of To-day, Who seek to squander and betray For sake of petty power and gold The glorious heritage of old! Oh for a man! He'll come! he'll come! To strike our garrulous drivellers dumb, And prove that patriot virtues still Inspire the heart and guide the will Of statesmen worthy of the name To vindicate their country's fame, And lift her glorious banner high, Defiant of the stormiest sky, To breeze and blast alike unfurl'd, A signal to th' expectant world! WEALTH UNTOLD Seek for treasure, and you'll find It exists but in the mind. Wealth is but the power that hires Blessings that the heart desires; And if these are mine to hold Independently of gold And the gifts it can bestow, I am richer than I know. Rich am I, if when I pass Amid the daisies on the grass, Every daisy in my sight Seems a jewel of delight! Rich am I, if I can see Treasure in the flower and tree, And can hear 'mid forest leaves Music in the summer eves; If the lark that sings aloud On the fringes of the cloud Scatters melodies around Fresh as rain-drops on the ground, And I bless the happy bird For the joy it has conferr'd; If the tides upon the shore Chant me anthems evermore; And I feel in every mood That life is fair and God is good! I am rich if I possess Such a fund of happiness, And can find where'er I stay Humble blessings on the way, And deserve them ere they're given By my gratitude to Heaven! ON THE DUOMO OF MILAN. I On Milan's high cathedral towers, Amid the marble saints I stand, And look beneath upon the bowers Far spreading of the glorious land Sublimely fair. On every side The splendours rise, the beauties glow— The leafy plains in summer's pride— The mountain summits robed in snow. II But 'tis not Nature's lovely face That here shall captivate the mind; Man is the genius of the place, And claims the homage of his kind. E'en as on Alpine peaks I gaze, The hoary guardians of the clime, I think the thoughts of other days, And dream the dreams of future time. III I deem, if voice of theirs could speak, What deeds their thunders might recall, What wrongs of Roman and of Greek, What crimes of Vandal and of Gaul; What seas of blood in warfare spilt, What hecatombs of heroes slain, What ruthless misery and guilt, What myriad battles, fought in vain. IV O Italy! superbly fair! O matron, beautiful and chaste! To wanton with thy raven hair, And loose the girdle from thy waist, The kings and robbers of the world, Have fought and wrestled evermore, And only kiss'd thy lips impearl'd, To stain thy lovely breast with gore! V With mangled limbs and bleeding head Chain-bound in many an iron coil, Death-smitten wert thou! but not dead— A prize for ruffians to despoil; Ruffians impervious to remorse, Enthralled and haunted by thy charms, Who'd rather trample on thy corpse Than yield thee to another's arms. VI Brave Italy! thou couldst not die! Thy sons, beneath their tyrants' yoke, Looked up to God's benignant sky With faith that never failed—or broke; They revelled in the realms of thought, And dared oppression to subdue The love they felt, the truths they sought In Art and Science—old or new. VII They raised in Dante's grasp sublime The blazing torch of epic song; Taught Tasso the heroic rhyme For after ages to prolong: Taught Michael Angelo to wield The magic brush that witch'd mankind, And forced the marble block to yield The gods and goddesses of mind. VIII They filled the world with fairer forms Than dull reality supplies, Except to those whom Fancy warms To gaze with sympathetic eyes; And gave to Europe, trodden low Beneath the heels of armèd men, A light to lead it—and to show How it might rise to life again. IX By Knowledge, Poetry and Art, And Union under wise control, In field and town and trading mart, To crush the despots of the soul, Wear them as waters wear the rocks When ocean tides their strength assail, And not by fitful earthquake shocks, Or flying storms of sleet and hail. X And not in vain—though Priest and King And wily statesmen did their best To stop the waters at the spring— They gushed and overflowed the West. And Europe bathing in the flood Drank freedom from the healing tide, And won through agony and blood The rights the robber had denied. XI And Italy—itself at last, After long struggles stood erect, Freed from the bondage of the Past, From wrong—from outrage—from neglect; Shone forth a gem in Europe's crown A priceless jewel, set in gold, With youthful fire and proud renown, To light the nations as of old. XII Thoughts are the rulers of the world, And weave the texture—warp and woof, Of Rights from banner high unfurled— And Truth's white robes—destruction-proof; Such are the thoughts with which I burn Long musing on the Duomo's cope; Such is the lesson that I learn For men and nations—Work and Hope! WRITING AND PUBLISHING. I AM not wrong, you say, to write— But wrong to publish: no one needs The songs and poems I indite, And no one cares for them or reads. What does it matter, I reply? The mavis on the hawthorn bough And lark on forehead of the sky Sing not to expedite the plough! They scatter melody like rain Bursting in freshness from the cloud, And care not though they chant in vain, Unknown, unheeded of the crowd. They sing for easement of their heart, And I for mine, in every tone; My song's my life, my better part— My joy, my comfort, and mine own! A NEW BALLAD WITH AN OLD BURDEN. I When this old cap was new— 'Tis eighty years ago— There was elbow room in the land Both for the high and low, There were hope and scope for all Who could wisely think and do And take the world as they found it, When this old cap was new. II Reverence dwelt in the thought Of the young man for the old, And age was accounted honour, Even if lacking gold. Money was not the god, But the servant of the true, And held in trust for the people, When this old cap was new. III Workmen did honest work To earn an honest fee, And none thought labour a curse Whatever a man's degree, Sons respected their fathers, Daughters their mothers too, And their love was very lovely, When this old cap was new. IV “Ladies” were seldom heard of, But abounded all the same, And were known as “gentlewomen,” And worthy of the name; They did not live to dress And flirt with nothing to do, Or to squander the time in shopping, When this old cap was new. V No “gentleman” in their presence Was rude enough to smoke, Or utter a too suggestive word In earnest or in joke; Or address them in casual meeting Even with a “How d'ye do?” Except with head uncovered, When this old cap was new! VI The vulgar slang of the street Was to the street confined, And never found an utterance On the lips of the refined; But was left to the slums and stables, And to tramps and the cadging crew, Who knew no other language, When this old cap was new. VII A servant girl was a servant, And was not called a “miss,” But Jane or Sarah or Mary Ann, As the fashion no longer is; And did not ape her mistress In pink or green or blue, But dressed in sober garments When this old cap was new. VIII The little children frolicked In the garden or the mead, And believed in fairy stories In thought and word and deed, Respected Jack and the Beanstalk And Sindbad the Sailor true, And never heard of an “'ology” When this old cap was new! IX A trader's word was his bond, And if he measured an ell, 'Twas an ell to the shade of an inch Either to buy or sell; Butter was churned from milk, And malt and hops were in brew, And wine was made from the actual grape When this old cap was new! X The “gift of the gab” was a blemish In those who aspired to rule, And was not the test of a statesman, But oftener of a fool; Deeds, and not words, were the proofs Of wisdom tried and true In the councils of the nation, When this old cap was new! XI The land was not encumbered With paupers lacking bread, And the guardians of the poor Had heart as well as head; The prisons had cells to spare, And the inmates were but few, For work was not starvation When this old cap was new! XII Betting was not a business,— Races were fairly run; And melancholy jokers Had mercy in their fun, And did not pump up ancient jests In journal or review To prove what absolute fools they were When this old cap was new! XIII Men met in the social circle When the wine and the wit were poured, And hospitality flourished E'en at the poor man's board; All intercourse was courteous Between the many and few, And the world was all the better, When this old cap was new! XIV But care and money-grubbing, And the pressure of the crowd, And “Devil take the hindmost” Shouted aloft and aloud, Have hardened the heart and the manners, And driven the world askew, Since the happier days departed, When this old cap was new! A VERY GREAT KING. I A King! a King! a mighty King! Who rules unquestioned Lord, More potent than an emperor, A tyrant—but adored! King Humbug governs countless realms More populous by far Than ever fell to cruel stroke, Or bent beneath the hardest yoke Of conqueror in war. II The Attilas and Charlemagnes, Who slaughtered fresh and free, Or sat on thrones of human bone, Were feebler far than he; For Humbug cares not to destroy, But, merciful to men, He rules them in a softer guise, By smiles and tricks and frauds and lies And skill of tongue and pen. III And yet, perchance, if we could count The harm that he has done, And daily does in every realm Beneath the blessed sun, We might confess that gun and sword Were easier to control Than Humbug, with his false pretence, Who spares our bodies but to fence His treason to the soul. IV So long live Humbug! Mighty king! Who rules without a peer, The head and master of the world, To all his subjects dear; Though wars may cease, yet long as men Are easier to kill Than to be forced to love the truth, He'll flourish in immortal youth, Obeyed and worshipped still! ANCIENT ERRORS. Lives there a man who hopes to slay An ancient error in our day? Let him attempt it if he will, And work, and work, and work his fill: He'll find, when he has struck a blow, How weak his arm, how strong his foe, And that against its brazen mail The sharpest lance will not avail! If, reeling from the blow you smote, You seize the creature by the throat, And drive your weapon through its brain It wriggles into life again, And stands erect and firm once more, And darts its venom as before. An error once familiar grown Becomes our darling—and our own: We hug it, kiss it, keep it press'd Snugly and warmly to our breast, And call the monster kind and good, And would not slay it if we could. Hydra, the snake of ancient time, Born, bred and nurtured in the slime, Nine-headed, under truthful skies, Was but the type of all the lies That in our era, as of old, Defy assaults, however bold, That flourish in prodigious growth In the morass of mental sloth, And twist and turn and press and crawl, And leave their traces over all! AN APPEAL TO THE PREACHERS OF ALL THE CREEDS. I Cease your drowsy disputations, Ye who'd preach the Word divine; Pouring out your turbid waters, When we thirst for living wine; Speak the truth as if you meant it, And would turn the wrong to right,— Not as if you half denied it, And mistook the dark for light! II Like a slow and oozy river, Neither clear nor broad nor deep, Flows your weary stream of doctrine, With a drone that lulls to sleep; Words like yours bring no conviction, Prick no conscience, touch no heart, And from sin's destructive courses Warn no sinner to depart. III Leave your dry, unfruitful dogmas, Faith unreasoning, credence blind, All the little narrow circles Where you wander, self-confined, Plashing in the mire and puddle Of your small, sectarian pond, Heedless of the mighty ocean And the boundless heaven beyond. IV Is there nothing more to preach of Than the letter of the law,— Nothing left to feed the people But the barren husk and straw, Nothing for the unbelievers In a creed their souls disclaim, But eternity of torment And the unconsuming flame? V Nobler themes than these invite you, If you'd throb as throbs the time, And would speak to hearts responsive Words more human, more sublime. “God is Love, and Love eternal;— All things change, but nothing dies;” Find this gospel, and expound it, In the Bible of the skies. VI O'er the starry vault of midnight See the countless worlds outspread,— Homes, perchance, of nobler creatures Than our planet ever bred,— Larger than the earth and fairer, And then limit, if you can, God's great love to one poor corner, And one little creature—man. VII God—our God—whose works surround us, Preaches in the summer wind, In the tempest of the ocean, In the silence of the mind, In the sparkle of the planets, In the splendour of the sun, In the voice of all creation,— “God is Love, and God is one;” VIII Preaches ever, and for ever, That for Him who made us all There is neither past nor future, Time nor space, nor great nor small, But one vast eternal Present, Filled with Love for all that are, From the dwellers in a dewdrop To the peoples of a star. IX “Love and infinite progression,” These the secrets of the sky, Open to the humblest spirit That but asks and wonders why; Shut alone from hostile churches, Struggling each to rule, or be, Who distress both faith and reason,— Blind because they will not see. X Give, oh give us true religion, Ye who'd preach the Word divine, We reject your tepid water, We're athirst for living wine. Rouse the heart, awake the conscience, Look beneath you, look above; Evil is but disobedience,— God is Justice—God is Love! THE TRUE SOURCE OF BEAUTY. The eagle on the misty mountain-top, That overlooks whole countries stretched below In varied beauty, has no eyes to see The splendour of the landscape; the sea-mew, Careering o'er the wilderness of waves, With sunlight streaming on its snowy wings, Knows nothing of the grandeur of the storm That grasps the wanton billows by the crest And twists them into cataracts of foam. The hungry dog, made happy by a bone, Beholds no beauty in the waving woods, Or in the roseate glories of the dawn; The gallant steed, whose hoof disdains the ground, Snorts passionate joy as he surveys his mate With supple limbs and friendly arching neck, But fails to understand what men can see In human beauty, be it as superb As Aphrodite's in her youthful grace, In perfect symmetry, divinely nude. Mind is the mother of all loveliness, The soul of nature, else inanimate, That robes creation in the glorious light That common eyes are powerless to behold, And tunes the voiceless harmonies of heaven To audible raptures heard but of the soul. Mind is the Man; and he who wilfully Neglects the priceless treasure, or in sloth And coarse indulgence common to the brutes, Sinks to their level, throws away the crown That marks him king, and abdicates the right Of high dominion given him by his God. DAY-DREAMS. Dozing in the sunshine 'Mid the summer grass, O'er my eyes half-opened Gorgeous visions pass: Through my teeming fancy, Vagabond and free, Stream in endless lustre Worlds of gramarye,— In a long procession Float majestic halls, Cities bright as amber Girt with golden walls, Realms of magic splendour, Mine to have and hold, And enjoy undoubting Till the tale is told; Sirens, houris, angels Beautiful and kind, Flit and fly and hover Through my careless mind; Kaiser! is thine empire Half as rich as mine? King! canst thou surpass me With thy glare and shine? Croesus! hast thou riches That with mine can vie? Pope! hast thou dominion Absolute as I? AN APPEAL. Death, when thou comest, do not linger long; Take me home gently: I am weak—thou'rt strong! I fear thee not, but would not have thee wait At my bedside, or hover at my gate: Be merciful, as all the strong should be, And spare my struggles as my soul goes free! ONCE ON A TIME. Once on a time—'twas in the “Long Ago,” When our hearts were pure as the drifted snow— The skies were bluer, The truth was truer, The sun and the moon shed brighter rays Than they ever shed in our later days! Oh the time, the bonnie Gone-by! Will its like never shine in the beautiful sky In the sunset of life as it did in the morn? Oh, never again! if the heart forlorn Heeds not the joy that the passing hours Offer as gifts from the heavenly powers, And scorns to pluck the fruit from the bough Of the ever kind and bountiful Now! Let us enjoy the passing day That all too rapidly fades away, And swell no more with sighs and frets And unavailing though fond regrets For the Past that was Present and offered us joy That we did our utmost to destroy. 'Tis the heart grown hard, 'tis the sight grown dull, That draws a veil over the beautiful: The Present has claims upon heart and head; To-day is vigorous—Yesterday's dead! A THOUGHT: In the Spring Sunshine. The flowers look up to the Sun, their God, And worship him with their beauty— 'Tis all their frailty has to give, But enough for Love and Duty. The unfolding leaves on the forest trees With hope and gladness quiver, And the birds sing praises on the bough To the bountiful Life-Giver. But men delight to trade in War; And if they slay their brother, They urge that Law demands the deed— 'Tis fair as any other; They take no heed of the God in heaven, Or His sun that shines in gladness: Pity them, birds! Pity them, flowers! Pity their hate and madness! FRIENDLY DISAPPOINTMENT. I Stern Disappointment! you're my friend, Although you're hard to bear! I've looked for joy, and in its stead You've brought me near despair; I sought for pearls of priceless worth, And from your cruel store You've given me mosses from the rocks And pebbles from the shore. II But heavy as your touch has been, I've learned to bear its weight, And drawing good from seeming ill, I've struggled with my fate; And when the agony has passed, Beheld with glad surprise That pain and sorrow and distress Were blessings in disguise. III I've learned that granite from the rock And pebbles from the tide May be employed to useful ends When pearls have been denied; So, Disappointment, do your worst! And, scorning to complain, I'll stand unconquered, and confess You've not been sent in vain! THE TRUE CHRISTIAN. I If thou'rt a Christian In deed and thought, Loving thy neighbour As Jesus taught,— Living all days In the sight of Heaven, And not one only Out of seven,— Sharing thy wealth With the suffering poor, Helping all sorrow That Hope can cure,— Making religion A truth in the heart, And not a cloak To be worn in the mart, Or in high cathedrals And chapels and fanes, Where priests are traders And count the gains,— All God's angels will say, “Well done!” Whenever thy mortal race is run. White and forgiven, Thou'lt enter heaven, And pass, unchallenged, the golden gate, Where welcoming spirits watch and wait To hail thy coming with sweet accord To the holy city of God the Lord! II If Peace is thy prompter, And Love is thy guide, And white-robed Charity Walks by thy side,— If thou tellest the truth Without oath to bind, Doing thy duty To all mankind,— Raising the lowly, Cheering the sad, Finding some goodness Even in the bad, And owning with sadness, If badness there be, There might have been badness In thine and in thee, If Conscience the warder That keeps thee whole Had uttered no voice To thy slumbering soul,— All God's angels will say, “Well done!” Whenever thy mortal race is run. White and forgiven, Thou'lt enter heaven, And pass, unchallenged, the golden gate, Where welcoming spirits watch and wait To hail thy coming with sweet accord To the holy city of God the Lord! III If thou art humble, And wilt not scorn, However wretched, A brother forlorn,— If thy purse is open To misery's call, And the God thou lovest Is God of all, Whatever their colour, Clime or creed, Blood of thy blood, In their sorest need,— If every cause That is good and true, And needs assistance To dare and do, Thou helpest on Through good and ill, With trust in Heaven, And God's good will,— All God's angels will say, “Well done!” Whenever thy mortal race is run. White and forgiven, Thou'lt enter heaven, And pass, unchallenged, the golden gate, Where welcoming spirits watch and wait To hail thy coming with sweet accord To the holy city of God the Lord! WE DARE NOT. We dare not, no! we dare not do them justice, The great good men that flourish in our time, The noble souls that urge mankind to effort By high example or by thoughts sublime; The praise we give them, though our hearts may feel it, Must find no utterance on the willing tongue, Lest the base crowd should scorn or misinterpret The unselfish homage too profusely flung, Lest they should deem it born of sordid motive, Or think 'tis fate whatever may befall, That in life's cruel and incessant struggle Praise of the Great is injury to the Small. Wait till they're dead! The time to do them justice Is when the daisies grow upon the grave, And rueful Memory sheds a trail of glory Upon the pathways of the good and brave! The future is the heritage of greatness, Whether it bloom in action or in song; Injustice and neglect may shroud the living, But Death impartial rectifies the wrong! PART II. THISTLEDOWN AND HIGHLAND HEATHER. TO MY OLD HIGHLAND PLAID. I For forty years thou'st been mine own, Cozie aye and ready, Over my breast and shoulders thrown, My faithful plaidie! My sheltering shield in wintry days And in the nights of summer, My pillow when the needful sleep Was an uncertain comer. II Never hast thou been false to me, Cozie aye and ready, Warm at my neck, snug at my knee, My faithful plaidie! We've clomb the hills, we've tracked the streams, We've trod the moorland heather, We've wandered through remotest lands, And braved the storms together. III Since first I donned thee, fresh and new, Cozie aye and ready, We have been comrades tried and true, My faithful plaidie! While suits, full twenty, that I've worn, And spent a pile of cash on, Have faded into shabbiness, And perished out of fashion. IV What changes we have seen since then, Lingering and unready, In fate, in circumstance, in men, My faithful plaidie! Old friends, old loves, estranged and dead, Have dimmed to shadows only, And flit before my mournful thought To whisper that I'm lonely. V And when thy folds I round me wrap, Cozie aye and ready, I often think it sore mishap, My faithful plaidie! That thy stout fabric should endure When youth's fond hopes have perished, Or the grave holds the senseless clay Of those I loved and cherished. VI The years have robbed my limbs of strength, To spoil me ever ready; But thou art staunch in width and length, My faithful plaidie! Thy web is firm in warp and woof; But flesh and bones grown weary, Make life no longer what it was When we were young, my dearie! VII Stay with me still, mine ancient friend! Cozie aye and ready, Until the fast approaching end, My faithful plaidie! And when the hand of Fate shall snap The mortal chain that bound me, I'll ask no better burial-cloth Than thou to wrap around me! STRATHNAVER NO MORE. I Bonnie Strathnaver, “Sutherlandshire was formerly a populous county, inhabited by a quiet, orderly, brave, religious race of men, remarkable for their fine forms, great bodily strength and high military qualities. . . . Since sheep have found their way to these pastures, this country is one wide and waste solitude. . . . Where three or four shepherds, with their dogs, can take charge of a district twenty miles in extent, it is not surprising if we wander for days without seeing the traces of human life—solitary as the sands of Africa or the immeasurable ocean.”—Critical examination of Dr. MacCulloch's work on the “Highlands and Western Isles of Scotland” (Edinburgh, 1825). extinct are the fires That glowed on the hearths of our true-hearted sires, Where we sat at the gloaming and learned at the knee The deeds of the Clan in the days of the free. II Red-handed Oppression, that calls itself Law, Has swept through the land, spreading havoc and awe; And, fierce as a whirlwind, laid low in the dust The sheltering homes of the brave and the just; III Laid low to the earth the abodes of the men That once were the glory and pride of the glen, Who fought for their country when Duty appeal'd And Victory summoned her sons to the field. IV Brave men and true women were fruits of the line, And grew on our moors in the old happy time, Ere the land was considered God's gift to the few With absolute right to possess and subdue; V Ere hucksters succeeded the noble and brave, And robbed us alike of a home and a grave, And cared not for harvests of barley and corn, While deer could be hunted and sheep could be shorn; VI While cattle and grouse could be turned into gold, And men like our fathers, those heroes of old, Brave in heart, strong in hand, clear of purpose and head, Were worthless as merchandise, living or dead. VII So the cot was pulled down, and laid waste the kail-yard, And turned into wilderness fruitless and hard For the sheep or the deer and the shy ptarmigan— For anything, everything, rather than man. VIII Bonnie Strathnaver! we see thee in dreams, Thy craigs and thy corries, thy braes and thy streams; We tread the green heath, we clamber the Bens, And wail for the woe of the desolate glens, IX And think of the time when a perishing realm, That rivals invade and that foes overwhelm, Shall call, but in vain, for the aid unsuborned Of the men it misgoverned, insulted, and scorned: X Shall call, but in vain, in its right of endeavour, For the help it has banished for ever and ever Of the clansmen, the noble, the strong and the brave, Who wander afar o'er the wild western wave. XI Strathnaver! Strathnaver! farewell evermore, We're banished afar from thy beautiful shore; But cherish the hope through all sorrow and pain That Right shall be Might in Strathnaver again! DONALD MACLEOD. Donald Macleod! Wouldst hear his story told? No stormy legend of the days of old— Of war and tournament and high emprize, Or knightly feuds beneath fair ladies' eyes; But a true story of our modern time, Such as befel, in cold Canadian clime, A dozen winters past, Donald Macleod, A poor man, one of millions, in the crowd. A stalwart wight he was, whom but to see Were to wish friend rather than enemy; A smith by trade, a bluff, hard-working man, Proud of his sires, his race, his name, his Clan. His strong right arm could hurl a foeman down Like ball a skittle; his broad brow was brown With honest toil, and in his clear blue eye Lurked strength to conquer fortune or defy. Few were his words, and those but rough at best, But truthful ever as his own true breast; Of homely nature, not of winning ways, Or given to tears, or overmuch of praise; But with a heart as guileless as a child's Of seven years old that frolicks in the wilds. Ere Donald left his shieling in the glen, By the burnside that tumbles down the Ben On grey Lochaber's melancholy shore, And sighed, like others, “I return no more,” To try his fortune in the fight of life In a new world, with fairer field for strife Than Scotland offers, overfilled with brains, Yet scant of acres to reward their pains, He woo'd with simple speech a Highland maid, Sweet as the opening flow'ret in the shade, And asked her, “Would she quit her native land, Her mother's love, her father's guiding hand, And make another sunshine far away, For him alone?” She blessed the happy day That a good man, so honest and so brave, Had sought the heart and hand she freely gave. To see the pair—the man so massive, strong; The maid so frail, yet winsome as a song— You might have thought the oak had chosen for bride The gowan glinting on the green hillside. And Jeanie Cameron, happy wife was she, Sailing with Donald o'er the summer sea, And dreaming, as the good ship cleft the foam, Of independence and a happy home On that abundant and rejoicing soil That asks but hands to recompense their toil. And Fortune favoured them, as Fortune will All who add strength and virtue to good-will. And Donald's hands found always work to do, Work well repaid, which, growing, ever grew; Work and its fair reward, but seldom known In the old land whence hopeful he had flown; Work all-sufficient for the passing day, With something left to hoard and put away. Content and Donald never dwelt apart, And Love and Jeanie nestled at his heart. In summer eves, his face towards the sun, He loved to sit, his long day's labour done, And smoke his pipe beneath the sycamore That cast cool shadows at his cottage door, And hear his bonnie Jean, like morning lark, Or nightingale preluding to the dark, Sing the old Gaelic melancholy songs Of Scotland's glory, Scotland's rights and wrongs, Or true love ditties of the olden time, Breathing of highland glens and moorland thyme. Thus years wore on. Their sky seemed sunny blue, Without a cloud to shade the distant view Of happiness to come. A child was born; Fresh to the father's heart as light of morn, Sweet to the mother's as a dream of heaven,— A blessing asked, but scarcely hoped when given. Most dearly prized! Alas! for human joy, That Fortune never builds but to destroy: The child was purchased by the mother's health; And Donald's heart grew heavy as by stealth He gazed, and saw the sadness in her smile That lit, yet half extinguished it the while; For, ah! poor Jeanie was too fair and frail To bear unscathed Canadia's wintry gale; And hectic roses flourished on her cheek, Filling his heart with grief too great to speak. Long, long, he watched her, and essayed to find Comfort and hope. At last upon his mind Burst suddenly the thought that he'd forego All that he earned in that New World of woe, And bear her back, ere utterly forlorn, To the moist mountain clime where she was born; To dear Lochaber and the Highland hills, And wave-invaded glens and wimpling rills, Where first he found her! Late, alas! too late! “Donald,” she said, “I feel approaching fate, And may not travel o'er the stormy sea To die on shipboard, and be torn from thee; Here let me linger till I go to rest; Time may be short or long, God knoweth best. But, as the tree that's planted in the ground, And sheds its blossoms and its leaves around, Dies where it lives, so let me live and die Where thou hast brought me 'twixt the earth and sky. I'd not be buried in th' Atlantic wave, But in brown earth, with daisies on my grave; Fresh blooming gowans from Lochaber's braes, With Scottish earth enough, the mound to raise Above my head. Donald, let this be done, When your poor Jeanie's mortal race is run!” The strong man wept. “Jeanie,” was all he said, “Oh, Jeanie, Jeanie!” and he bowed his head, And hid his face behind his honest hands, The saddest man in all those happy lands. “Jeanie,” he said, “ye maunna, maunna dee, And leave the world to misery and me!” “Donald,” she answered, “woeful is the strife That my warm heart is fighting for its life; And much as I desire for thy dear sake, And the wee bairn's, to live till age o'ertake, I feel it cannot be. God's will is all; Let us accept it, whatsoe'er befall.” And Jeanie died. She had not lain i' the mools Three days ere Donald laid aside his tools, And closed his forge, and took his passage home To Glasgow, for Lochaber o'er the foam; Alone with sorrow and alone with Love, The two but one to lead his heart above. And long ere forty days had run their round Donald was back upon Canadian ground; Donald, the tender heart, the rough, the brave, With earth and gowans for his true love's grave. WHEN THE CLANS ENJOY THEIR OWN AGAIN. (Air: “Prince Charlie's Welcome to Skye.”) I There is plenty in the land, If its lords would understand Their duty to the people in the glens where they were born: There is barley for the “bree,” There are herring in the sea, There are peats upon the moor, there is grass for hoof and horn, There are kail-yards for the kail, There is milk to fill the pail, And farms and crofts and pastures in the shadows of the Ben. And as true as dark grows light, When the morning follows night, The Clans shall enjoy their own again! II In the happy days of old, Ere the cruel greed of gold Drove justice from the hearts of traders in the soil, There was earth to dig and plough, There was forage for the cow, And meal and malt and raiment for the sons of honest toil; And it's coming yet ere long, When the right shall “ding” the wrong, And our rulers learn that cattle are of less account than men; And the struggle shall be won, And justice shall be done, And the Clans shall enjoy their own again! THE BURIAL MARCH OF KING DUNCAN. [Tradition records that the body of King Duncan, slain by Macbeth, was carried in a solemn procession of bards and warriors from Inverness to Iona, the ancient burial-place of the kings of Scotland. Shakespeare mentions the fact in his matchless tragedy of Macbeth—Act II., Scene 3—when Macduff, in answer to the question, “Where is Duncan's body?” replies: “Carried to Colme Kill, The sacred storehouse of his ancestors And guardian of their bones.” The name of Colme Kill, or Icolmkill, has long been superseded by that of Iona, a contraction of Innis-Shona, pronounced Innisona, or the “Holy Island.” The chapel adjoining the cathedral is dedicated to St. Oran. The two recurring lines, in quaint old spelling, of the following ballad are taken from a funeral dirge, or coronach, of the thirteenth century, which has been reprinted in collections of legends and poetry.] I Wise in council, strong in fight, Every daye and aule-a, Foe of wrong and friend of right, Christe receive his saule-a! Vengeance slumbers on our path, And awaits the morrow, When 'twill waken in its wrath, After toil and sorrow. March we now o'er hill and glen On to Innis-Shona, The place of rest he loved the best, The Isle of Saints—Iona! II Warriors bear him to the grave Every daye and aule-a; Merciful and mild and brave, Christe receive his saule-a! Bards rehearse his deeds of fame In our Highland story; All the people shout his name, Thinking of his glory, Bear him over strath and hill, Safe to Innis-Shona, The place of rest he loved the best, The Isle of Saints—Iona! III Sound the pibroch as we go, Every daye and aule-a! Loud and sad in wailing woe, Christe receive his saule-a! Hard oppression's cruel chain Snapped or shrunk before him; Sorrow never sighed in vain When it would implore him. Bear him to his honoured grave, Deep in Innis-Shona, The place of rest he loved the best, The Isle of Saints—Iona! IV St. Columba gone before, Every daye and aule-a! Waits his body on the shore, Christe receive his saule-a! Waits amid th' expectant ghosts Of the great departed, Bards and kings and warrior hosts And sages noble-hearted! Bear him proudly to the grave, On to Innis-Shona, The place of rest he loved the best, The holy Isle—Iona. V Oran's ancient shrine shall hear, Every daye and aule-a! Holy anthems ringing clear, Christe receive his saule-a! As we lay him in the tomb, The appointed portal, Through a vestibule of gloom, To the home immortal. Bear him slowly to the grave, Deep in Innis-Shona, The place of rest he loved the best, The holy Isle—Iona. VI Fire is quenched, and light is fled, Every daye and aule-a! Albyn mourns her hero dead, Christe receive his saule-a! If in darker days to be, Evil fate betide us, Chiefs and kings as brave as he God will send to guide us. Lay him in his honoured grave, Deep in Innis-Shona, The holy place by God's good grace, The Isle of Saints—Iona! THE CANADIAN HIGHLANDER. I Thanks to my sires, I'm Highland born, And trod the moorland and the heather Since childhood and this soul of mine First came into the world together; I've “paddled” barefoot in the burn, Roamed on the braes to pu' the gowan, Or clomb the granite cliffs to pluck The scarlet berries of the rowan. II And when the winds blew loud and shrill I've scaled the heavenward summits hoary Of grey Ben Nevis or his peers In all their solitary glory, And with enraptured eyes of youth Have seen half Scotland spread before me, And proudly thought, with flashing eyes, How noble was the land that bore me. III Alas! the land denied me bread, Land of my sires in bygone ages, Land of the Wallace and the Bruce, And countless heroes, bards and sages; It had no place for me and mine, No elbow-room to stand alive in, Nor rood of kindly mother earth For honest industry to thrive in. IV 'Twas parcell'd out in wide domains By cruel law's resistless fiat, So that the sacred herds of deer Might roam the wilderness in quiet, Untroubled by the foot of man, On mountain-side or sheltering corrie, Lest sport should fail, and selfish wealth Be disappointed of its quarry. V The laws of acres deemed the clans Were aliens at the best, or foemen, And that the grouse, the sheep, the beeves, Were worthier animals than yeomen; And held that men might live or die Where'er their fate or fancy led them, Except among the highland hills, Where noble mothers bore and bred them. VI In agony of silent tears, The partner of my soul beside me, I crossed the seas to find the home That Scotland cruelly denied me; And found it on Canadian soil, Where man is man in life's brave battle, And not, as in my native glens, Of less importance than the cattle. VII And here, with steadfast faith in God, Strong with the strength I gained in sorrow, I've looked the future in the face, Nor feared the hardships of the morrow,— Assured that if I strove aright Good end would follow good beginning, And that the bread, if not the gold, Would never fail me in the winning. VIII And every day, as years roll on And touch my brow with age's finger, I learn to cherish more and more The land where love delights to linger. In thoughts by day, and dreams by night, Fond memory recalls, and blesses Its heathery braes, its mountain peaks, Its straths and glens and wildernesses. IX And hope revives at memory's call That Scotland, crushed and landlord-ridden, May yet find room for all her sons, Nor treat the humblest as unbidden; Room for the brave, the staunch, the true, As in the days of olden story, When men out-valued grouse and deer, And lived their lives—their country's glory! AN APPEAL TO THE CHURCHES NORTH OF THE TWEED. I Gree! bairnies, gree! Thou guid auld kirk, thou braw new tree! And independent stark U. P., Tell us the good o' a' the pother, If ane's the very same as t'other, And each the image of his brother,— Gree! bairnies, gree! II Gree! bairnies, gree! If ane be weak, there's strength in three, Ye're a' but twigs o' ane good tree; Ye waste your wit in hostile clatter, About precedence at the platter, So sit down cannie and grow fatter! Gree! bairnies, gree! III Gree! bairnies, gree! The people's hand is large and free, And widely opened it will be, Wi' largess well deserved and ample, If on your foolish pride you'd trample, And set the world a bright example, Gree! bairnies, gree! IV Gree! bairnies, gree! The fiert a difference I can see, Except in matter o' the fee: Ye should walk cheerily togither, And cease to fight wi' ane anither— Nor hand aloof frae friend and brither, Gree! bairnies, gree! CORN RIGS AND BARLEY RIGS. I It fell upon a Lammas night, When corn rigs were bonnie, Beneath the moor's unclouded light I held awa' to Annie; A lang, lang promised tryste we kept, And 'twixt the late and early, I took my staff into my hand, To meet her 'mang the barley. Corn rigs and barley rigs, And corn rigs are bonnie; I'll ne'er forget that happy night Amang the rigs wi' Annie. II The sky was blue, the winds were still, The moon was shining clearly, I proffered her baith heart and hand Among the rigs o' barley; I vowed my heart was a' her ain, I swore to love her dearly, And bade her name the happy day, Amang the rigs o' barley. Corn rigs and barley rigs, And corn rigs are bonnie; I'll ne'er forget that happy night Amang the rigs wi' Annie. III She named the day, the first o' May, Her heart was beating rarely, My blessings on her bonnie face Amang the rigs o' barley! And since that time, in storm and shine, 'Tis twenty summers fairly, We've never rued our wooin' time Among the rigs o' barley. Corn rigs and barley rigs, And corn rigs are bonnie; I'll ne'er forget that happy night Amang the rigs wi' Annie! THE BONNIE LASS TOCHERLESS. I hae my tocher in my face, And tocher in my voice, And a dozen tochers in my heart, To bid the lads rejoice. Tochers in honours and in lands May gang the gait they came, But tochers in a lassie's love Are aye the bonnie same! I hae nae tochers in the bank, Except the bank of truth, And faithful love and trust in Heaven, And health and hope and youth. So take me, laddie, if you will, And if our love endure, We'll walk the wide world hand in hand, And never know we're poor! DEFIANCE. I Should evil fortune grip us fast, And aft it strives to fa' that, We'll no be scared or trodden down, But stand erect for a' that! We'll meet it fair, an' straight and square, And if it's wrang we'll right it, And hae the pride, whate'er betide, To grapple wi't and fight it! II The greatest griefs, if bravely met, Grow mean and sma' and a' that, And if we're strong, they'll yield ere long, And rin awa', and a' that! And if a nut defy our jaws, And we are fain to crack it, We'll tak' a hammer in our fist, And spite of fate, we'll brak' it! MY BONNIE MARY; OR, THE EMIGRANT. I Come away, come away, my bonnie Mary, Come away, come away, over the sea, Albyn's no place for us, my bonnie Mary, Landless and homeless wherever we be. But there's a land, my dear, Noble and grand, my dear, With work for the willing, And farms for the tilling, Far away over the bonnie blue sea; Come away, come away, my bonnie Mary, Come to the land of the brave and the free! II Come away, come away, my bonnie Mary, Come away, come away, over the tide; Far, far behind us, my bonnie Mary, Leaving the land where our forefathers died, Far, far behind, my dear; Fortune's unkind, my dear, Hardship's unfailing, Grief's unavailing, But joy is before us, and hope long denied; Come away, come away, my bonnie Mary, Love is our comfort, God be our Guide! HE'S OWER THE HILLS. He's ower the hills that I lo'e weel, He's ower the hills that's true and leal, He's ower the hills and ower the sea, An' he'll come back to marry me. That I had gear an' he had nane Was cause o' mickle grief and pain; For this they parted him and me, But no' for ever—bide a wee! For a' my gear, wer't ten times told, In lands, in houses, and in gold, I'd gi'e it for one word alone, The word that made him a' mine own. The burnie wimplin' o'er the lea Maun find the river and the sea, And hearts that love, if strong as Fate, Maun come thegither soon or late. He's ower the hills that I lo'e weel, He's ower the hills that's brave and leal, He's ower the hills and ower the sea, And he'll come back to marry me. THE BARLEY MILLER. My friends a' pass me coldly by An' glower an' glaik aboon me, An' a' my bills come tumblin' in Like billows that would droon me. I'm low doun, doun, doun, Down for lack o' siller; I'm low doun, doun, doun, Quoth the barley miller. The lassie that I lo'ed fu' weel, And courted late and early, Has ta'en the gee (but bide a wee), I'm sure she'll jilt me fairly. I'm low doun, doun, doun, Down for lack o' siller; I'm low doun, doun, doun, Quoth the barley miller. The boon companions ance I knew, When they and I were couthie, Have no' a plack in a' their pack To lend me when I'm drouthie. For I'm low doun, doun, doun, Down for lack o' siller; I'm low doun, doun, doun, Quoth the barley miller. And some there be who praised my wit When I had fouth o' siller, Who ca' me now a doited loon And blethrin barley miller! For I'm low doun, doun, doun, Doun for lack o' siller; I'm low doun, doun, doun, Quoth the barley miller. An' yet I think I'll bide my time, Tho' Fortune sairly skelp me, And trust brave heart and good right hand To comfort me and help me. Although I'm doun, doun, doun, Doun for lack o' siller, I'll no' be doun for evermore! Quoth the barley miller. MY HEART'S IN THE HIGHLANDS. I My heart's in the Highlands, my heart's in the glens, Tracing the burnies and climbing the Bens, Treading the heather and bracken so green, With gowans and bluebells up-glinting between. II My heart's in the land of the leal and the true, The land of the kilt and the bonnets of blue, Where the plaid never covered the breast of a slave, And the lassies are fair and the laddies are brave. III My heart's in the Highlands, the long summer day Breathing the health-giving breeze on the brae, And braving the tempests that gather below; My heart's in the Highlands, wherever I go. IV My heart's in the Highlands, in sunshine and cloud, On the loch, in the corrie far frae the crowd; By the rivers I love, in the glens where they flow, My heart's in the Highlands, wherever I go! LORD RONALD, AND THE TWO GREAT CHESTS. I There lay two chests in the deep, deep earth Under the castle tower, Buried there for a thousand years If they had lain an hour. II The one contained a fearful plague To desolate the land, And work worse woe than e'er befell From sword or flaming brand. III The other held a precious gem Of more transcendant worth Than all the gold that e'er was dug From the bowels of the earth. IV They were as like in size and form, Reposing side by side, As the twin blue eyes in the happy face Of a young and blooming bride. V They were as like as the cherries twain That grow on the selfsame tree, Or the droplets of the summer rain That falls into the sea. VI And no man dared, though many wished, And had wished for ages long, To open the lids of these awful chests And force their fastenings strong. VII They longed for treasure, but feared the Death That was decreed the doom Of the rash intruder who loosened the plague To feed the ravenous tomb. VIII Lord Ronald was heir of the Castle lands, And more than tongue could tell He loved a maiden of low degree— Sweet Ellen of Invernell. IX She loved him truly in return, But ever his suit denied Unless his sire, a proud old Earl, Looked favouring on his bride. X But the father loved the rich red gold As much as the brave young son Loved the bright gleam of Ellen's eyes And the ground she trod upon. XI The Earl had chosen his son should wed A lady fair and young, With a dowry that might tempt a duke, And from ancient lineage sprung. XII But the wayward, love-enraptured boy Despised the gold and land, And where he could not give his heart Refused to give his hand. XIII “I'll tempt the Fates!” he suddenly said, As he roamed in the woods alone; “And if I open the lucky chest, I'll make my love mine own. XIV “My sire shall have the gold he loves If I open the golden chest, And I will marry the girl I love— My beautiful, my best! XV “And if it be my cruel fate To open the chest of Death, I'll die for Ellen and bless her name With my departing breath.” XVI Lord Ronald dug with spade and pick From morn into the night, And offered up an earnest prayer That Heaven would guide him right. XVII He found the coffers side by side, And gazed with hope, yet dread, Alike in hue, in form and size, As old tradition said. XVIII With desperate haste he wrench'd the lid Of the one that offered first, Hoping the best that might befall, And reckless of the worst. XIX He wrenched and wrenched, and found within Nought but a parchment scroll, On which was writ, in runic rhymes, “God save the sinner's soul! XX “The plague's already in the land, Fear not a greater pest; 'Tis lust of gold that fills mankind: Consult the other chest! XXI Lord Ronald wiped his damp cold brow, And breathed a prayer to Heaven: “If I do wrong in seeking gold, Be the offence forgiven! XXII “I sin for sake of woman's love, And not for love of pelf; And love no woman for her gold, But only for herself.” XXIII He wrenched the lid, and wrenched again, Till with a sudden spring It flew wide open, and disclosed A little golden ring, XXIV Tied with a silken cord that lay On a scroll of parchment white, On which was writ in runic rhymes, In characters of light,— XXV “True love is better than all the gems That shine on a royal crown, And richer in more true delight Than wealth can scatter down! XXVI “Take thou the symbol! If thou find A hand on which 'twill dwell, With heart to ratify the pledge And truth to bind it well, XXVII “Thou wilt be rich, however poor Thy lot in life may be: Gold is the dross—its gain is loss; Love is felicity!” XXVIII Lord Ronald's sire forbore to chide; And ere the day was gone The low-born Ellen of Invernell Received his benison: XXIX And on her wedding day she shone Like sunbeam through a cloud, And gathered homage like a queen From all the wondering crowd. XXX Her step was light, her smile was bright, And from her lustrous eyes Love linked with goodness sparkled forth Like morning from the skies! “GOOD NIGHT, AND JOY BE WI' YOU A'!” The night has been a joyous night, But here no longer maun we stay, Lest morning with her tell-tale light Should dawn to beckon us away. Wi' warnings fair we've banished care, Nor listened ance to sorrow's ca', But danced and sung baith old and young;— “Good night, and joy be wi' you a'!” Yet, happy as the hours hae been, 'Twould no be grateful to forget, 'Mid a' the pleasure we hae seen, That time may bring us greater yet! Our merry meeting next to be! Meanwhile may ne'er a grief befa' And ne'er a friend know friendship's end; “Good night, and joy be wi' us a'!” PART III. LIFE, DEATH AND IMMORTALITY. TIME AND ETERNITY. Frail Body! cease to sue for breath, Thou canst not conquer in the strife: Time was created but for Death, And all Eternity for Life! TWO STUDIES OF DEATH. In the Dark Shadow. There hangs a shadow on the face of day, Dark, chill, and faintly luminous with haze, That robes the earth in one lugubrious pall; It hushes cheerfulness, and chokes the voice Of hope and comfort, latent in men's hearts; It hath no shape defined or palpable: But o'er the soulless body of the dead Seems to proclaim, in mystic syllables, The final victory of the greedy grave. “Wear doleful black! The spirit hath departed. Weep and lament in soul-subduing gloom; And slowly, wearily, and heavy-hearted, Consign our brother to the sheltering tomb. No more, no more his pleasant smile shall cheer us, No more his liberal hand shed largess free; No more his welcome step, approaching near us, Shall tell of friendly intercourse to be; No more his words shall bless the little children That sport and prattle round the cheerful hearth; No more his honest laugh shall ring responsive, To fan the lambent flame of innocent mirth; No more his voice shall utter words of gladness, To guide the lost and comfort the forlorn. Music is hushed in all-pervading sadness, Eclipsed for ever is the light of morn; The earth hath claimed him, and the earthworms riot Over his senseless clay: the spark hath fled. Peace to his ashes! Let him sleep in quiet 'Till the last trump shall sound to wake the dead.” In the Bright Sunshine. Beside the bier there stands a radiant angel, Invisible to unbelieving eyes, But palpable to hope and faith and love. Clad in white garments, lustrous and resplendent, She turns her tender eyes in holy rapture To the clear sky, and points her guiding finger To the bright sunshine, bathing earth with glory, And seems to chant, in tones of adoration, That pulse-like ripple on a sea of silence In harmonies ecstatic heard in heaven, Her song of triumph o'er the conquered grave. “Robe not your limbs in melancholy blackness, Nor weep disconsolate. Be bright of cheer; Think of our brother in the eternal mansions, Where sorrow enters not, nor doubt, nor fear; Where the undying spirit dwells with God, Partaker of His essence, heir sublime Of all the secrets of the universe, Blurred and forgotten in the mists of time; Where death is dead, and life, in perfect fulness, Climbs up the eternal stair of endless good, That leads to better ever, evermore. In God's unspeakable Infinitude; Obstruction knows him not, space doth not bind him; Limit hath no existence; time in vain Rolls in its earthly circles to oppress him; He knows it not, he feels it not again. He hath inherited the endless Now, In which the stars are but as grains of dust, Sprinkled upon the illimitable shore Of the To be, the Is, the Was, the Must, That fill the universe with life and love,— Life that is knowledge, love that is delight. These are his heritage beyond the bomb, These are his glories in the Infinite!” NOTHING MORE? To eat, drink, sleep, and propagate and die- Such is the invariable round Of tasks that must be done beneath the sky By all who cumber the prolific ground. But is life worth the penalties it lays Upon the helpless children of mankind, If there be no Hereafter to their days, Or happy Immortality for mind? If human fate were nothing more than this, Death were delight, and nothingness were bliss! THE RIVER AND THE SEA. I Fair river of Life! I have sailed thee, Borne onward by favouring gales, And landed betimes in the meadows, Or roamed through the beautiful vales. I chose a fair bride in her splendour, And friends who were joyous and free, And we sang and we danced and made merry, And never once thought of the sea. But now we have come to its margin, We pause to reflect while we may, Of the present, the past, and the future, And the night that comes after the day. II Dark ocean of Death! I must cross thee, And travel to regions unknown, Where I trust that my God will receive me In the light that encircles His throne; To give my nude spirit expansion To soar, and eternally soar, 'Mid splendours of heights empyréan And the infinite Evermore! Dark Ocean! there's brightness beyond thee, My soul can behold it afar, And 'twill pass o'er thy cloud-covered waters With God for its compass and star! LIVING AND DYING. We only live that we may die, If Fate this problem give; May not its nobler answer be, We die that we may live? THE LITTLE CHINK. I A chink upon the dungeon wall Lets in the light of day, Where ministering angels float unseen And sparkle in the ray. The prisoner when the night is clear Forgets his bolts and bars, And gazes through the friendly rift At moonlight and the stars. His soul mounts to them, though his flesh Pines in a living tomb; And heaven's bright orbs hold high discourse To cheer him in the gloom. II Poor prisoner! type of all condemned To tread life's weary round, And feel the pressure of the chain That binds us to the ground. We groan behind our prison bars, But through a narrow chink Have glimpses of the light of God More glorious than we think. The rift of Reason is but small, But through the rift we see The light Divine—the hope and faith Of Immortality. CAN THIS BE ALL? I To come into the world Without our own consent, And live our destined years In ceaseless discontent; To struggle in the gloom Behind life's dungeon wall, And pine in vain for light,— Can this be all? II To drag a weary chain Over a rugged road, And groan at each remove And shifting of the load; To feel the animal curse That weighs on great and small Of slavery to the flesh,— Can this be all? III To pace the same dull round On each recurring day, For seventy years or more, Till strength and hope decay; To trust and be deceived, And standing, fear to fall And find no resting-place,— Can this be all? IV To strive to find the truth, But fail for want of light, To pierce the heavy gloom That shrouds it from our sight; To dash our aching heads Against the obstructing wall That Reason cannot pass,— Can this be all? V To know not whence we come Or whither we shall go When this poor life has pass'd, With all its weight of woe, And doubt if life be life When loss and grief befall, Or whether we but dream,— Can this be all? VI To live as lives the grass And the autumnal grain, Born of the sun and sod And fertilising rain, And pass away like them At scythe and sickle's call, And leave no trace behind,— Can this be all? VII And if we propagate By Love's supreme decree Poor wretches like ourselves Predoomed to misery, To run the selfsame course In doubt and fear and thrall From the cradle to the tomb,— Can this be all? VIII And if by sorrow nursed We sit alone and weep Beside the grass-grown mound Where our belov'd ones sleep, And envy them their rest Beneath the grave's cold pall, Our desolate hearts inquire,— Can this be all? IX Ah, no! Fate has not launched So cruel a decree, Or whatsoe'er we are, Twere better not to be;— Eternity is ours, And man that seems so small Shall live again in heaven With God his All in all! DIVINE ANANKÊ. Great mother of the teeming universe, Supporter of the fabric of the skies, Guider of stars and planets in their course, Parent of men and nations, beasts and birds, And all that crawl and creep and float and fly, Anankê, author of all life and death, Why should we strive to undermine thy wall, Or climb above it in a vain attempt To solve the awful mysteries of heaven, Or lift the smallest corner of the veil That shrouds from finite sense the Infinite? Why wreck the petty skiff we call our mind Against the impassable rocks that bar the way We'd fairly travel to the Dark Beyond, That after Death we may perchance behold And find revealment of the hidden things Of matter and of spirit, space and time, And good and evil, portions of our self? Let us be humble in imprisonment, And patient in our hopeless ignorance: God is necessity. Necessity is God. IN THE ELMER WOODS. The great high-spreading elmer tree That waves to the winds its branches free Must fall beneath the woodman's blows Ere the time of the winter snows. Such is the woodman's high decree, Fate's minister for him who owns Land and forest, grass and stones, And all the woodland spreading wide, And corn and pastureland beside. If such the doom of the lordly tree, That stands so firm, so fair, so free, May not the Fates reserve for me, At woodman Death's appointed time, A downfall in my manhood's prime? And in the elm tree's girth and bole May there not lurk in Time's control The boards and planks that workmen true Shall saw and fashion, nail and screw, Till they construct a coffin fine To hide this perishing flesh of mine? Perhaps! But till the hour arrives I and the tree can live our lives: Its boughs can wave in the summer air, And birds build nests in its branches fair; The rains refresh it at morns and eves, And the moonlight slumber on its leaves; And I, content with the passing day, May find enjoyment while I may, And laugh with care-unfettered mind, Living and loving and resigned, And drink, instead of the dews and rain, My “Marcobrünner” and champagne, And interchange with men and books Thoughts and fancies and friendly looks. The tree knows nothing of its fate, Nor I of mine, and so I wait In fearless trust, whate'er befall, That a good God reigns over all. THE GOOD OF IT. What is the good of being born Into this world of hate and scorn, Naked and feeble and forlorn? What is the good, though childhood's years May have their smiles as well as tears, Though youth, which recks not of the morrow, Partakes of joy as well as sorrow? What is the good, though love is bright And robes the world with rosy light In the first dawning of its day, If evening sees it fade away? And when, the longer that we crawl On earth's too miserable ball, The more we feel that life is vain, And that man's heritage is pain! What is the good of lengthened life, If purchased by perennial strife, When sordid wants and grinding cares Surge up for ever unawares, And fond illusions, one by one, Exhale, like dewdrops in the sun,— What is the good? Perchance our birth Is but probation on the earth, And that as soon as life begins We have to suffer for the sins Committed in another sphere, All to be expiated here? Support us, Faith—if we'd rebel! This is the answer: Earth is hell, Or purgatory, to refine By pangs of punishment divine, And fit the immortal soul to soar Towards perfection evermore, And flourish in celestial light, Partakers of the Infinite! LIFE'S LITTLE DAY. I.The Dawn. An innocent infant, with blue, earnest eyes, Paddling upon the shore with glad surprise At each new object that attracts its sight— Shells on the beach, or sea-mews gleaming white, Or the dark billows glittering far away In the first radiance of the coming day. II.Early Morning. The sun is up, and bathes the eastern sky With floods of light; the tide is rising high, And the boy's thought, with far-extending scope Impatient of the present, dwells with hope On the unknown but slow-approaching time When he shall creep no more, but mount and climb. III.The Forenoon. The glowing glorious noon has not yet shed Its radiance, but the moving mists have fled, And the blood courses warmly through his veins, And passion wakens with its joys and pains And dear delights far short of his desires, And physical energies and mental fires. IV.Midnoon. Noon! and the widening landscape, full revealed, Shows crags and pitfalls that the morn concealed, Which he must pass in safety if he can, Now that he's reached the dignity of man, And sees the toils he's bound to undergo If he would flourish in a world of woe; The perils that beset him on his path, The jealousies, the treacheries, and the wrath That he must conquer if he'd stand erect And win a footing in the world's respect, Like a true soldier in the ennobling fight Against the daily wrong that wars with right. V.Afternoon Wearied and worn, but hopeful still and bold, With head still clear and heart not yet grown old, He rests a little from the moil of life, And takes a respite from perennial strife, To look back cheerfully on duty done And fruitful triumphs well and bravely won. VI.Sunset. Clad in full glory in the crimsoning west, The sun's last radiance gilds the ocean's breast, And the day darkens in the east afar, While on Night's forehead gleams the evening star, Herald of heavenly hosts as yet unseen, That fill with splendours all the vast serene. VII.Night. 'Tis night, and not a cloud upon the blue, And countless glories burst upon his view In all the dread magnificence of heaven. He bends with awe and feels his sins forgiven, And hears the angels' voices chanting high, “Mount, kindred spirit, mount into the sky!” IMMORTALITY. “Man never dies—but all men die,” Is this the immortality We fondly crave? When we are gone Are we as heedless as a stone Of all that was or is to be? Alas, for thee! Alas, for me! The blooming rose, the mounting flame, Might, could they think, repeat the same Sad query to the passer-by, And ask if they but live to die; And if the life that moves them now Is all the cruel fates allow. Woe's me! like gudgeons in a glass, We turn and twist, but cannot pass,— In vain we'd work the problem out. Our senses fail us, and we doubt; And when to doubt is but to grieve, Is it not better to believe? EUTHANASIA. The king of terrors, such as cowards feign In the wild nightmare of the heart and brain, Is to the wise the Lord of life and light, And hath no terrors to their thought or sight. No vengeful arrows bristle in his hands To scatter sorrow o'er the peaceful lands; But love angelic from his brooding wings Drops on the earth and all created things; And his calm eyes, with pure celestial sheen, Glow through the universe with light serene. The foolish crowd, unchristian-like, behold In the dark grave nought but the encircling mould That wraps the body, when the soul elate Takes joyous wing to the celestial gate, At which Death stands to welcome mortals in, Freed from corruption, purified from sin. Death is but change of vesture for the soul— New scope, new strength, and life beyond control Of time and space and earth's impeding clod, With bliss eternal in the love of God! A MOTH AND A MAN. Questions. Moth, that art fluttering, flying Up in the sunny air, What dost thou know of the wonders That earth and sky declare? Nothing! oh, nothing! nothing, Except that the world is fair! Man, that art creeping, crawling Painfully on the earth, What dost thou know of the riddle Of life and death and birth, Of the purpose of existence, And what thy soul is worth? The Man's Reply. The moth and myself know nothing; We're both the slaves of sense, And only see in a circle Through a medium dark and dense, And flourish for short season, Only to travel hence. The insect knows no sorrows, And, happier far than I, Takes life without inquiry, Under the clear blue sky. I know that I am mortal— Born but to suffer and die! IN PROSPECT OF DEATH. Dear Mother Death! on thy placid face I look like a loving child, And know thou wilt purify my soul From all that hath defiled. I've no regret at leaving a world So weary and full of woe; Then take me, Death, whenever thou wilt, Thou'lt find me ready to go. I feel the healthful breeze of life That flows through the open door, Through which my spirit prepares to pass And to mount for evermore Up to the highest heights of heaven, Freed of the bodily clod, To learn and learn for ever and aye The mysteries of God. Farewell! farewell! O dungeon clay! Farewell! O struggling breath! And welcome to the gentle touch Of liberating Death! Float me and waft me and carry me up, Defiant of time and space, To the throne of my Father and my God And the radiance of His face! INCOMPREHENSIBLE FINITUDE. Man's senses fail to comprehend How anything that is can end: That all things change we see and know, Life into death, joy into woe; But something into nothingness Transcends the reason to express: 'Tis felt and seen—not understood, There is no law of finitude. If this be true for worlds that roll, Is it not true for life and soul? For life and love in endless range, Undying death—eternal change? TWO MIGHTY SISTERS. Two sisters, angels, twins in love and might, Viceregents of the Lord of life and light, And agents of His everlasting will, Pervade the universe, and fill The stars and galaxies that roll Through infinite space, the body of God's soul; The one serene and pale, with pensive face, Seems sad at heart, though sadness has no place In her celestial mind, for love divine Governs her thought, and with celestial shine From her angelic and benignant eyes Sheds heavenly pity through the awful skies. The other, beautiful as she, Radiant as sunlight or a peaceful sea, Scatters perpetual morning through the stars, And guides them God-ward in their heavenly cars, While from her wings outspread and eyes all-seeing She drops perpetual bliss of being; Her looks illumine heaven and earth, Balancing loss by gain, and death by birth. Her earnest sister, passing o'er the lands, Holds in the hollow of her hands The mightiest empires, flushed with pride of power, And in the fulness of the destined hour Strips them of glory and of fame, And puffs them out like the ephemeral flame That dies for lack of fuel, and is flung Back to the nothingness from which it sprung, Without a record on the page of time, Shade of a shade—faint echo of a chime That rang a moment and was hushed for ever, And stifled in its own endeavour To make itself be heard above the din Of jarring discords in a world of sin. Her bright-eyed sister, smiling at her side, Welcomes new nations to supply their place In equal majesty to those that died, To run like them their short appointed race. Life follows Death, and Death is mother of Life— Light comes of darkness—peace is born of strife— And renovation tracks destruction's path To heal the ravage of its seeming wrath, And fill the gaps that destiny has riven In the eternal scroll and luminous book of heaven. Poor little mortals! know that Death's your friend, And builds again in innocence and joy What she was powerless to destroy, And in a chain that stretches without end Links star to star, and sun to sun, In everlasting unison, And gives the children of a perishing earth Angelic wings in new eternal birth, To soar and soar—for ever, evermore Up to the heaven of heavens, and starry floor— To Love, to Know, to Worship—and Adore! BONDAGE. In youth my body was my joy, A bank from which I loved to borrow; In age it works me sore annoy, And pays its debts in care and sorrow. In youth I plucked the wayside rose Of sensual pleasure, blooming o'er me; In age the bloom no longer blows, And thorns and brambles sprout before me. O body! thou'rt a treacherous friend, And lendest help but to deceive us, Until, our bondage at an end, Death bids the pitying grave receive us. AN INVOCATION AND AN ASPIRATION. I Come to me, Death: I fear thee not; Thou'rt nothing but a change I wot. If for the worst, 'tis God's behest; If for the better, it is best. I'm but a fancy in a dream, I'm but a straw upon the stream, I'm but a ripple on the sea, An atom in Immensity. II Yet no; I have diviner trust, I am no speck, no grain of dust, But child of God, and heir sublime Of life beyond the reach of time— Life unconfined by earthly bars, And as eternal as the stars, That live and love as well as I, My fellow-creatures of the sky. LITTLE GREATNESS. We despise the passing hour Because it seems so small And so much less than the world On which we creep and crawl. But is the little so little, On earth's very little ball? Or is anything great or little?— God knows, who is All in all. A GRAVE. Put me in, and cover me up With wholesome earth,—no more I crave: A tombstone is but waste of wealth, And fails to sanctify the grave. Countless millions of men and women As good as I, or better maybe, Rot in the earth without memorial: Why should you place one over me? 'Twould last perhaps for fifty years, If no one cared for the perishing stone, Or carved no foolish lies upon it, To make survivors blush or groan; Plant pale primroses if you will, Or gem-like daisies 'mid the grass, They'll lend a beauty to the ground, Or preach a sermon as you pass. BODY AND SOUL. I I would not that my mind should die Before the mortal flame, And perish into nothingness, Like an extinguished flame. While body with ignoble needs, And slavery to the clay, Lived on, unconscious of its loss And hastening to decay. II Thus did I sigh, and quite forgot, With care-o'erclouded brow, That ever with the immortal soul Dwells an eternal Now. That all our faculties of sense, Though seeming great, are small, And but the windows of the mind, And openings in the wall; III That when the imprisoned spirit looks Beyond its dungeon bars, It longs to reach its heavenly home, And travel through the stars, Freed from the burden of the flesh That clogs its upward flight, And darkens to its wistful gaze The wonders of the light. IV Mute, blind, and fettered though it be, It is but for a time; When rescued from its penal chain, And in immortal prime, It shall enjoy the glorious Now, In nobler spheres than this, With myriad senses, every one A doorway into bliss. LIFE. Seventy journeys round the sun, Cares and sorrows, great and small; Toils and troubles, sighs and tears: That is all—that is all. Love that blooms in summer hours And decays ere winter's fall, Morning freshness, lost ere night: That is all—that is all. Fame that whispers in our ears, Joy to come at merit's call, Borne upon the breath of fools: That is all—that is all. Wealth, that may be sought and won, If we'd climb or if we'd crawl, And but worthless when possess'd: That is all—that is all. Mound of earth, six feet by two, Shut from every pain and thrall, Birth-right, death-right, both in one: That is all—that is all! AMRITA. Soar, my freed spirit, sin-forgiven, Soar to thy long-lost home in heaven! Soar to the light of perfect day, A living portion of its ray. Loosed from the impeding clogs of earth And all the shackles of thy birth, Thou'lt find there's work that must be done Beyond the pathways of the sun, And that eternity may be Too narrow for thine energy, If thou wouldst truly seek to know All that the universe can show Of love and hope and high endeavour, Working for ever and for ever. Rest is but death in part or whole, And is not spoken of the soul! Life, life eternal, thou art mine! Life, Love, and Knowledge, gifts divine, That clear the way to worlds unknown, That guard the footstool of God's throne, Life, linked to body, frail no more, Or slave to sorrow as before, A prey to suffering and to need, Ignoble in its daily thought and deed; But pregnant with celestial fire, To glow, to sparkle and aspire, To flourish in eternal bloom, Defiant of the engulfing tomb, With senses not confined to five Poor outlets for the narrow hive In which our faculties are held By bondage of the flesh compelled, But streaming through a thousand pores, That open like enchanted doors, Disclosing each a new delight, Beyond the pleasures of the sight, Beyond the raptures of the ears, Pealing music of the spheres, Till heaven itself, in sense enshrined, Possesses all the immortal mind, And breathes the tidings great and free Of progress in eternity. THE LOST ME. I Whither has fled the undying Me, The “Me” that I knew in a bygone day; My other self in the times of old, When life was in its morn of May, Ere it had ripened to leafy June, With its warmer, wider, and lustier scope, Nor lavished the wealth of its summer bloom For due fulfilment of my hope? II “Me” and I could climb the mountains Up to their very topmost crest, Or cleave the billows with vigorous sinews, And calm, unruffled, defiant breast. Me and I could face the tempest, Braving its perils undismayed, And revel in the pride of youth As courage or indifference bade. III Where has he gone? to which dim part? Has he utterly vanished beyond recall, The happy Me, that hated to doubt, And found belief and good in all? When heart and brain and body and soul, Flushed and stored with electric fire, And nothing seemed too great or high For mad ambition to desire. IV When every man was honest and brave, And every woman was fair and true, And love was robed in heavenly light For ever beautiful and new,— When Fancy rode the steeds of Reason, Goading and spurring them, free and wild, And every cloud had a golden border, And every storm a rainbow child. V Alas! another “Me” has entered Into my spirit and my brain, Unlike the Me that once I cherished But was not destined to retain. The wretched Me that has taken his place Is old and sad and feeble of limb; His good right hand has lost its cunning, His voice is weak, his eyes are dim. VI He roams no more the tangled wild-wood, He scales no more the mountain height, But sits in his easy chair reflecting That after noontime comes the night; His fond illusions are dead and buried In the grave of the bygone years, Dug by the spade of disappointment Too oft in agony and tears. VII “Me, oh Me! why hast thou left me?” Strong is its faith—the soul replies: “Thy earthly vesture fits no longer, New garments wait thee in the skies; Crippled by time, thou'rt bound to travel The beaten path that all have trod— Thou'lt find eternity before thee, And love and light at the throne of God!” THE DAY'S MARCH. I Marching! marching! marching! On to the city of Death, Nearer and ever nearer In every step and breath; Bound to enter its portals, To rest when the day is done— Marching with the moments And following as they run! II Pleasant it was, and sunny, When I started on the way To tread the leafy woodlands And the fresh green meads of May: To hear the skylark singing On the fringes of the morn, And gather wayside blossoms Or wreaths of the white hawthorn. III To sport with the little maidens, Or sit beneath the tree, When the drill of the books was over And the limbs and the mind were free; To laugh and prattle and frolic, Or build up fairy schemes In the palaces of Cloudland, And people them with dreams. IV Till one as fair as daylight Enthralled my willing heart, And we marched together onward And vowed we'd never part; Vowed the vow and kept it, And felt in the pride of youth That life was a brave possession When cheered by love and truth. V I carolled in the morning To many a joyous tune, I planned the good of my fellows In the flush of the sunny noon, And held fast hold in the twilight To the faith of early prime, That the good might grow to the better In the fulness of the time. VI Marching, ever marching Amid confronting foes, I trampled down obstructions Defiant as they rose; Or wounded in the conflict, I gathered strength anew, And dared the hardest fortune To daunt me or subdue! VII Pleasant it was to linger Under the blessèd skies, To walk with the noble-hearted, The brave, the good, the wise; To hold high converse with them, And learn the truths they taught And gather wit and wisdom From the interchange of thought. VIII And now, as the night approaches, Mine eyes behold, afar, The crimsoning gold of the sunset And the gleam of the evening star; And beyond, in the shadowy distance, Dim seen on the misty height, The domes of Death's dark city O'er-canopied with light,— IX The light, the love, the glory, Into which my soul shall soar; Darkness and death behind me, Eternity before: Leaving my earthly vesture In the earthly mother sod, To wear angelic garments In the mansions of my God. THE JOYS OF SEVENTY. I I'm old and ready to depart, I've passed the threescore years and ten, But still keep corners in my heart For honest women and brave men; I love to see on beauty's cheek The bloom that pleases younger eyes, And find enjoyment when I seek Among the witty and the wise. II My pulses throb when coming years Presage the triumph of the right, Mine eyes suffuse with wholesome tears, Or glow with sympathetic light, When great unselfish deeds are done That rival in our sordid age The noblest victories ever won Attested upon history's page. III I love the modest wayside flowers, The dawn, the moon, the evening grey; The pleasant sunshine and the showers, The gloom of night, the blaze of day; I love the garden and the wild, The woodland and the barren shore, The artless prattle of a child, Or memories of the days of yore. IV I love a lover, prize a friend, And joy in every joy that's pure, And, knowing grief must have an end, Make light of ills I cannot cure: I love my fellows all I can, Hate Hate, scorn Scorn, and loathe a lie, And, part of God's eternal plan, I'm pleased to live, content to die. NIRVANA. Goddess benign! Great Mother divine, Lay me to sleep on thy beautiful breast; Weary of life And renewal of strife, I ask but oblivion—I pray but for rest! Sink me to nothingness! robe me in death; Lull me and soothe me and stifle my breath, Deaden mine ears to the cry of the crowd, Its doubts and contentions, Its feuds and dissensions, The groans of the humble, the shouts of the proud. What have I done in the ages departed, That I should remain to float hopelessly on— A waif on the ocean, a mote in the sunshine, A sound that is silenced, a light that has shone? Life hath no charms for me, Death no alarms for me; Peace may be broken, and rest have an end! Come then, Oblivion, my hope and my friend; Come and possess me, Absorb me and bless me; Beautiful nothingness, Heightless and fathomless, Life's final glory and crown of completion, Refuge eternal from sorrow and pain; Love is but lust to replenish the planet With slaves and oppressors that cumber the soil; Fame's but a blast on a wearisome trumpet, And wealth is but mockery, burden and toil. Holy Nirvana! Heaven's true fulfilment! Essence of all things! Destroyer of time! Victor of destiny! Mother of ages! Born unbegotten, eternal, sublime! Grant me, oh, grant me the boon that I crave: Dreamless beatitude—peace in the grave! LA BELLE MORTE. I Oh, Death! you are my comrade, My comrade and my friend; Come, sit beside me on the bed Cheerily to the end. I'm not the least afraid of you, And shrink not from your touch, And feel in presence of your smile That you can teach me much. II You are not hideous to my sight, Your voice is like a hymn; Your eyes are filled with heavenly light Like those of seraphim. You bear no javelin in your hand To pierce me to the heart, But whisper words of peace and love That warn me to depart. III You tell me things I never knew, Or cared to understand; And show me things I never saw, Till guided by your hand: The worthlessness of human life, That men most fondly prize, Compared with the immortal hopes That blossom in the skies. IV Bright hopes that fill the expectant mind When we discourse together, And I behold through wintry storms The heavenly summer weather. You preach to me and prophesy, That when the rags I wear Fall from my soul and leave it nude In sunshine and the air, V I shall assume angelic robes, Unweighted by the clod, And float as rapidly as thought Through all the realms of God. And learn, as death unseals my eyes From films of earthly night, The secrets of the Universe And the mysteries of the Light. THE SOUL HOVERING OVER THE BODY TAKES JOYOUS LEAVE. I Body! that once wert a noble shrine For a soul to dwell in, no more thou'rt mine. Thou wert a palace in youth's bright day, But the walls of the palace have crumbled away; The burdensome years and the physical chain Of desire and pleasure—of grief and pain, Have bought the penalty of their birth And weighed thee down to thy mother earth; Thy glory's fled with the days of yore, Farewell, frail body, for evermore! II The robes thou gavest me to wear Are torn and tattered beyond repair; New garments of celestial dyes Await me in the friendly skies, To which I joyfully return Imperishable and eterne. Thou held'st me by a tyrant's tether When thou and I were linked together, But now I'm free to fly and soar, Farewell, frail body, for evermore! III Thine eyes, that circumscribed my sight And dulled the fulness of perfect light, Are growing dimmer, while mine behold The glory of the heavens unroll'd; Clear to my vision, extending wide, Freed of obstruction, and purified Of all the stain received from thee In the prison of thy mortality; I'm gliding through the eternal door,— Farewell, frail body, for evermore! IV Thou hadst few secrets to disclose, Little secrets of joys and woes, And yearnings for the imperfect joy That time but gave thee to destroy. Now heaven's own secrets flood my gaze, Of love and ecstasy and praise, And Godlike progress and endeavour, That lift me up for ever and ever! I tread already the azure floor,— Farewell, frail body, for evermore! ON THE DEATH OF A GREAT MAN. Bury his faults in the grave where we've laid him, Speak not his name but with blessings and sighs; Hard is the heart that would seek to upbraid him, So great as he was and so low as he lies! High were his aims and untarnished his honour, Danger he scorned in the pathways of right; England shall miss, when the cloud is upon her, Him who oft led her—through darkness to light. Weep, England, weep, for the mighty departed, Write his pure name on thy worthiest page; Nobly he lived, though he died broken-hearted, And moulded to justice the mind of his age! “MY WIFE'S A WINSOME WEE THING.” The title alone of this poem, but neither the idea nor the treatment, is borrowed from Robert Burns.—Author's Note. I My wife's a winsome wee thing, Wed twenty years or mair, And aye the bonnier growing, As baith mine eyes declare. 'Tis love that made her bonnie, And love that keeps her sae, In spite o' Time and Fortune, On Life's uncannie way. II Love scares awa' the wrinkles From aff her smooth white brow, And duty done through good and ill Aye keeps her conscience true,— And yields her happy peace of mind, If e'er the world goes wrong, And turns the murmur of lament Into a cheerful song. III The kisses gather on her lips Like blossoms on the rose, And kindly thoughts reflect the light That in her bosom glows,— As wavelets in a running stream Reflect the noontide ray, And sparkle with the light of heaven When rippling on their way. IV She is a winsome wee thing, And more than twenty year She's twined herself about my heart By all that can endear; By all that can endear on earth, Foreshadowing things above, And lead my happy soul to heaven, Rejoicing in her love!
