      <field name="fulltext">THE MODERN DUNCIAD, WITH NOTES, CRITICAL AND BIOGRAPHICAL. FIRST PRINTED IN THE YEAR 1815. SIXTH EDITION. THE MODERN DUNCIAD. P. How anxious is the Bard, and yet how vain His wishes: F. Cease this moralizing strain, What mortal will peruse it? P. P'rhaps a few:â F. Alas! the town has something else to do, Than read one line of all thou shalt indite, While Byron, Wordsworth, Scott, and Croker write. 'Tis hardâbutâ P. Spare thy pity, 'tis my lot; What some might think a grievance, hurts me not: The bard by fashion dragg'd before the scene, Nor wakes my envy, nor provokes my spleen. Let venal critics puff him to the town, And herald hawkers cry him up and down, Indiff'rent still, I hear the loud acclaim, Nor court that noisy strumpet, Common Fame. Yes, I can bear that envy, hate, and spite, And cold contempt attend on all I write; That Cottle's idiot, Thurlow's splay-foot line, And Barrett's doggerel be preferr'd to mine; No threats can sway me, no opinions bend, I care not;âlet them censure or commend. Yet would I speak, but coward fear restrains The rebel blood just rising in my veins; Puts my imagination to a stand, And makes my pen drop harmless from my hand. F. Why Truth, that arms the Stoic, ne'er can failâ P. Then fear for once give way, and Truth prevail. When I behold in this weak driv'ling age, Poole, Dibdin, Pocock, Hook possess the stage; Charm gallery, box, and pit, a judging throng! With melodrame, and pantomime, and song: See boxing Yarmouth in the lists appear, And Hawke drive forth a flaming charioteer; See Coutts ape all that Queensb'ry was before, A palsied, am'rous Strephon of fourscore! Yes! when I hear frail Misses, grey in years, Scream their lascivious odes, and rhyming Peers In little sonnets, tender, dull, and soft, Outwhine the mawkish frippery of Lofft; Then, then I boldly rise, and dare the worstâ F. Forbear this railing: P. I must speak, or burst. There was a time when Churchill, bold and coarse, Gave wit its point, and satire all its force; When Pope, immortal Sat'rist! made his prey The Herveys and the Gildons of the day; Dragg'd into light th' abandon'd scribbling crew, And boldly scourg'd them in the public view: But now, so cheap is praise, there scarce remains One fool to flatter in our courtly strains. Had they but liv'd to witness present times, Whatsins, what dulness had provok'd their rhymes; Satire unaw'd would then have dar'd to speak, Till deep conviction glow'd on Hâdfât's cheek; And Manners, brainless blockhead! stood confest The public nuisance, and the public jest. F. Once more forbearâthy proper medium know:â Degraded names! can Satire stoop so low? When Hâdfât ambles in a courtier's guise, All know the hoary pimp, and all despise. Does credence wait on each prepost'rous tale? Who cares a jot when Agg, and Manners rail? They dare vexatious suits, as well they may, Who have nor shame, nor wherewithal to pay. Let them enjoy in secret, dirty souls, Their miserable bread, and peck of coals; 'Twere cowardice to drag them from their holes. What can provoke thy Muse? scarce thrice a year Matilda's woeful madrigals appear; Lewis no more the tender maid affrights With incantations, ravishments, and sprites: Crusca, (to Gifford thanks!) is fairly fled, And heavy Wharton sleeps among the dead; E'en Walcott's impious blasphemies are o'er, And Andrews' Prologues are the vogue no more. What can provoke thy Muse?âthe blinded school, Whose greatest boast was that it err'd by rule, That philosophic horde of fools and knaves Has fall'nânor Paine blasphemes, nor Priestley raves. Repentant bigots bow and kiss the rod, And prostrate nations own the name of God. Reason, that dang'rous pride of human kind, For ever soaring, and for ever blind; Prone to distrust when tardy to discern, Too weak to compass, yet too proud to learn; With shame reviews each ill-digested plan, And turns with horror from âThe Rights of Man.â What can provoke thy Muse?âin silence deep Tooke restsâbut not in everlasting sleep: Another scene awaits his trembling sight, A gloom more awful, or a blaze more bright! The veil is rent, the Sceptic's hateful name Stands justly branded with contempt and shame; The Christian Banner is again unfurl'd, And Truth once more illumes a falling world. P. All this is trueâbut still enough remains, Enough in conscience to provoke my strains. See Thelwall, void of decency and sense, Erect, God wot! a school for eloquence; The newest style of rhetoric to teach, And full-grown gentlemen their parts of speech: While from his tub, Gale Jones, sedition's sprite, Nonsense with sense confounds, and wrong with right; Rants, bounces, capers, a fantastic show! To scare the shilling orators below. Prolific Pasquin plies th' eternal quill, Fitzgerald rhymes, and Cobbett proses still; Hoarse Clio Rickman's sonnets bay the moon, Clio, a poet, patriot, and buffoon. Godwin pursues his philosophic schemes, And rapt in trance, Joanna Southcott dreams; Jeffrey turns critic, but betrays his trust, And hot-press'd Little breathes the soul of lust; While chaste Minerva kindly lends her aid To calm the scruples of each wishful maid. Lo, mad enthusiasts, would-be saints, stand forth, Sworn foes to god-like genius, private worth, With furious zeal attack e'en Shakespeare's fame, And hurl their pois'nous darts at Garrick's name; And while they talk of Truth, of Candour rave, Insult the dead, and violate the grave. In Magazines vile anecdotes appear, And deal out dirty scandal through the year; For desp'rate libellers, when duns assail, Dare lawsuits, whips, the pill'ry, and the jail. This Hewson Clarke can tell, misguided youth, What demon lur'd him from the path of truth, With low ambition fill'd his canker'd mind, To entertain the basest of mankind? O! may he late for all his sins atone, And while he gains their ears, preserve his own! Behold yon gorgeous Sign that swings in air, (A well-known refuge for the sons of Care,) There meet a piebald race, who cautious creep From garrets high, or in night cellars sleep; The courtier bland, the opposition churl, To taste the sweets of politics and purl. There needy scribes, whose trade is to abuse, Forge lies and scandal for the next day's news; There Whig and Tory wrangle, blockheads twain, And Vetus drops th' abortions of his brain; There sits Britannicus and heaves a groan For England's debts, unmindful of his own; There party-drudges for their party scrawl, And baser hirelings who are slaves to all; There whines Morality, a canting monk, There roars Reform, heroically drunk; Stern Patriotism tries new schemes to find To serve his country, and to cheat mankind; There the vile Quack invents his pois'nous pill, By royal patent privileg'd to kill; And there the Atheist's nightly thunders roll, That to destroy the body, this the soul. Hail, happy days! when all shall equal be, And man and master shall alike go free; This land, created by the Spencean charm, The people's birthright, and the nation's farm! When those who toil, and those who labor not, Blest intercourse! partake one common lot; When nature's nymphs enjoy true past'ral lives; Glad, teeming mothers allâthough none are wives! Bright era! that shall banish all our fears, And chain down order for a thousand years! Treason shall walk abroad with giant stride, And murder prowl, with rapine by his side; Curs'd infidelity, and deep despair, And anarchy, dire fiend! shall revel there. Down with yon sacred altars! useless blocks! Detested relics!âe'en vindictive Knox Shall rise from hell's dark caves with furious joy, And breathe again his spirit to destroy. Then ask no moreâyet if a doubt remain, Why thus to Satire I devote my strain; With this reply be satisfied at once, While Bowles exists, can Satire want a Dunce? Bowles who hath cherish'd as a costly pearl, The horse-play, dull obscenity of Curll; Th' accumulated trash of Smedley's page, For why?âto vent on Pope his puny rage. Is it not hard, (my Friend) nay, doubly hard, A sorry critic, and more sorry bard, Whose jaded Pegasus, 'yclept divine, Cries out for quarter at the fourteenth line, Should for base lucre (Oh, how vilely won!) Complete what Ralph and Dennis left undone? Thus urg'd, thus prompted by the warm desire To vindicate the genius I admire; To add at least my humble meed of praise, To names rever'd in Britain's brighter days; To strip the poet of his false sublime, (Then, Bowles, the Lord have mercy on thy rhyme!) And shew that critics may at times appear In praise too cold, in censure too severe; I take my penâwhen Folly met his eye, Democritus would laughâand so must I. Now to beginânor distant need we roam, Kind fate hath sent us Fools enough at home; Our modern Poets, bounteous in th' extreme, Rhyme on, and make waste paper by the ream. Five thousand Lines compos'dâa modest stint! Next Westall must design, and Bulmer print: Then bound with care, and hot-press'd ev'ry sheet, The wonder-working Quarto shines complete! Behold a gaping crowd that never tire! See Busby, worthy Son of such a Sire, (For truth must own, when all is said and done, The Father's pertness centres in the Son:) Straining with all his might 'gainst mood and tense, To make the Doctor's fustian sound like sense. He views the audience with theatric stare, His hands with equal motion saw the air; His voice in dulcet cadence taught to float, Seems the shrill pipings of an eunuch's throat: Assembled thus, our sapient nobles sit To hear how Busby, not Lucretius, writ. If now and then a sentiment exprest In language more indecent than the rest, Strike the attentive ear;âwith fond regard, A hundred hands are rais'd to clap the Bard: The Marchioness adores the charming man, Fitzherbert leers, and Jersey flirts her fan; While doting Headfort, tickled to the core, Starts up entranc'd, and ambles at threescore. Vain Scribbler! and is this, this all thy aim, Art thou content with transitory fame; Fame, that shall haunt thee living, dân thee dead? Thus dost thou feed our ears, thus art thou fed? But what avails, if faithless to my trust, I hide (you cry) my talent in the dust? Why am I learn'd? WhyâStop this vaunting tone! Is learning nothing then, till fairly known? But still (you quick rejoin) how sweet the sound To hear the murmur of applause go round,â ââThat's He,â (the finger pointed all the while)â âRenown'd for wit and elegance of style; Whom Critic Mawman puffs, whose senseless whine BÅotian Buchan quotes, and calls divine.â Come, Phillips, come, for eloquence hath pow'r, Gale Jones his tub shall lend thee for an hour! Whether thou warble in inflated style, King Brian's glories in the âEmerald Isle;â Or âIreland's hope and England's gloryâ praise In fulsome prose, more fulsome than thy Lays, With strong mercurial pow'r, which all must dread, Thy touch turns gold and silver into lead. Lo, at thy name what hosts of Dunces rise! Dulness awakes, and rubs her drowsy eyes, With sleepy haste the poppy wreath prepares, To crown her fav'rite bardâwhile wisdom stares! Next, to complete thy triumph, even now, The cap of liberty shall grace thy brow; It speaks thy prowess, and thy functions tells, Almost as truly as the Cap and Bells! Stark metre-mad, the lovesick Edwin sends Of jingling splayfoot verse, some odds and ends To driv'lling Asperne, in whose magazine Th' invet'rate sons of dulness vent their spleen; Proud of the gift so graciously bestow'd, He prints the thing which Edwin calls an ode. How Laura smiles! What less can Laura do? It gives her beauties that she never knew. 'Tis so pathetic! who unmov'd can read? Melissa faintly whispers, âSad, indeed!â In ecstasies Lucretia dies away, And Edwin grows immortalâfor a day! And is not now the author truly blest, By critics flatter'd, by the fair caress'd? Shall not his praise by future bards be sung, When envious death has stopp'd his tuneful tongue? F. By trade a censor, and resolv'd to sneer, You drive the jest too far; 'tis too severe To brand a blockhead in your angry strains, For what he cannot helpâhis want of brains! P. Be answer'd thusâhis itching after fame, His bold obtrusive vanity I blame; Not the true dulness that inspires his lays, But the false pride that makes him covet praise. F. Then censure all mankind, for who is free? The flame that warms their bosoms dwells with thee. In search of fame the soldier travels far, The smirking lawyer courts it at the bar, Th' intrepid seaman wins it at his post, The man of virtueâ P. When he shuns it most!â F. The anxious poet claims it as his due, And (pr'ythee speak with candour) so do you. P. Thus candid, I replyâif now and then Success attend the labours of my pen, If those who buy my works, and those who read, Applaudâand that's a rarity indeed! I'm not so proud, so squeamishly severe, But honest Fame is pleasing to mine ear. But that I write for that short-liv'd renown Which Fashion gives the vot'ries of the town, I cannot grantâfor mark! the gift divine Was Darwin's once, and, Busby, may be thine. Athirst for fame, which Magazines, Reviews, Too coy, deny the labours of his Muse; My Lord (what will not vanity afford?) Invites a host of Critics to his board; Some creeping, slip-shod hirelings of the day, Whom Colburn treats with âdouble pots and pay.â âMy friends,â he cries, âspeak freely, tell me plain, What say the public to my epic strain?â Will they speak truth, too poor to be sincere? But I may surely whisper in thine ear, I who abhor a bribe;âthen thisâthy rhymes In dulness rival past and present times; So lameâthe weary audience think they see Old Settle's doggerel new revived by thee; So badâthat worse will ne'er be seen again Unless thou should'st resume thy scribbling vein. From such pursuits 'twould turn thy trifling mind, Had'st thou but, Janus-like, a face behind; To mark the lolling tongue, the side-long leer, The pointed finger, the contemptuous sneer, And all the silent mock'ries of the town That ridicule thy title to renown: But thou must feast on flatt'ry all thy days, And be the dupe of ev'ry blockhead's praise. For mark their judgment, hear their quaint replyâ âWhen genius rears its head shall slander die? A brother's fame what brother bard endures? Thus envy follows merit great as yours. You try the epic strainâin colours true A second Homer rises forth to view! All hearts you captivate, all tastes you hit, With Hammond's tenderness, and Prior's wit. Thus flatter'd by the minions of his board, Who struts, who swells, who scribbles like My Lord? And soon he rises in a feverish dream A first-rate poetâin his own esteem. Thurlow (alas! will Thurlow never tire?) New points his dulness, and new strings his lyre; That lyre which rang the praises in our ears Of âgodlikeâ poets, and âtranscendentâ peers; With quick dispatch his teeming brain unloads, Then issue forth Acrostics, Sonnets, Odes; Loud empty bombast, flights of false sublime, Not prose indeedâbut tortur'd prose in rhyme. F. Shall blood Patrician no distinction claim? Dwell there no virtues in a noble name? Is Title nothing? Wealth? Pray learn for once One grain of prudence:â P. To respect a dunce! Bow, flatter, dedicate, and bend the knee, A mean dependantâthis advice to me? No, let me rather in affected drawl, Write hymns with Collyer, idiot tales with Ball; Turn, Commentator grave, and pore content To find a meaning where there's nothing meant; Than shield from censure undeserving strains, Because, forsooth, they spring from noble brains. Not fools alone, as mad examples strike; This metromania reigns in all alike: Both wit and dunce the restless muse inspires With equal rage, though not with equal fires; Not Byron stands acquitted of the crime, A promise made in prose, he breaks in rhyme. Hark! Printers' Devils say, or seem to say, âNo rest have we, Fitzgerald, night, or day; For thee, vain man, a weary watch we keep, Nor sleep enjoyâalthough thy readers sleep. Does Southey pause, or paper-staining Scott One moment's respite grant, a page to blot; Thy hobbling Pegasus, a sorry hack, Still faintly drawls to keep us on the rack. Should e'er the fates condemn thee for thy crimes, (For thou to sense art traitor in thy rhymes,) For paper wasted, ink so idly spilt, Yet kindly bid thee choose what death thou wilt; Think, think on Clarence, he (a bold design!) Resolv'd to perish by his favorite wine; Thy volumes round thy neck to make thee sink, O! let 'em drown thee in thy favorite ink!â Where old Blackfriars pours her sable sons, A mingled tribe of Critics, Bards, and Duns, Dwelt Phillips, an industrious, plodding wight, And by the King's good favor dubb'd a Knight; A bookseller was he, and, sooth to say, Not Nichols had more authors in his pay. At verse and prose so ready were the host, 'Twas emulation which should scribble most; And Pratt himself would undertake an Ode In one short ramble on the Hampstead road. But high above the rest, distinguish'd far, As Bard and Tourist, shone the mighty Carr! Of scribes the chief! and once upon a time The undisputed Lord of prose and rhyme. Hist'ries he wrote, and etchings he would draw Of towns and citiesâthat he never saw:â And travell'd daily o'er much foreign land, (More wondrous still!)âin Bridge Street, or the Strand.â And hence arose, with all his boasted care, Some odd mistakes, which made the reader stare. Thus German dames were beauteous to the sight, The French profoundly grave, the Dutch polite; The Scotch sincere, and Ireland's jovial sons Too dull by half to relish jokes and puns. Did critics sneer at some unlucky guess? Sir John's own bulls wereâerrors of the press: And lest upon his back the rod should fall, The Printers' Devils were to blame for all. But soon Sir Richard found, (sagacious elf!) The Knight lov'd money, and his works the shelf; Whereat Sir Richard, of his bargain sick, And heartily repenting of the trick, Consign'd the Quartos to a different fate, And eas'd his counter of their pond'rous weight; To pastry-cooks dispers'd them, sheet by sheet, By which Sir John was read in every street; Propitiation just, by all confest, For martyr'd truth, and history made a jest. Some love a jingling rhyme with all their heart, Where love and nonsense bear an equal part; Like Rosa's sonnets, in themselves a host, Rosa, the Sappho of the Morning Post; Or Hafiz' madrigals, but rarely seen, A heap of sounding words which nothing mean. Some authors love in Epic strains to soar, And swell to be what Homer was before; Thus, Asperne's day, and Talavera's fight, Have made some scribblers in their own despite. Others, the dupes of an infectious rage, Ransack the dulness of a former age; For rare, moth-eaten parchments search the land, And poring much, but little understand. There mote you spy the pedant deep y-read, In useless heaps of learned lumber dead, Damning all modern wit as dull, absurd, Since the bright days of Caxton and De Worde. So, when some Virtuoso smuggles home The mutilated blocks of Greece and Rome, Heads, noses, arms, our curious eyes engage, We prize their beauty much, but more their age; Not Chantrey's art so wonderful appears, It wants the sanction of three thousand years. How oft some new-fledg'd Bardling on the wing, Essays a puny flight, and tries to sing, Whose trifling Muse, by folly nurtur'd long, Ne'er soar'd above a rebus, or a song. On frozen banks the purple violets rise, And roses bloom beneath December skies; For contrarieties in place and time, Our poets think allowable in rhyme. To doggerel verse, where sense is never found, (An easy task) we give the charm of sound: Thus:ââWith percussive palm the door assails, Now scrapes the gritty wall with bleeding nails, Now running round, help! help! with shrill alarms, Help! help! help! help! and writhes her frantic arms. O live, my joy, my solace! sobs she wild; Why do you gaze on me, my heav'nly child? She sees not, hears not! Speak, in mercy move! Here, here is milkâawake, my love, my love!!â F. All this is sorry trash, and well may claim The rod of Satireâhear a nobler name:â ââOf man's first disobedienceââ P. Stop, I pray! Nor with our would-be poets of the day, Name One, who, hateful prejudice apart, Has reach'd the glorious summit of his art! Let modern poetasters rhyme their fill, To charm an hour we've Pope and Milton still; And solitude shall never fail to please, While it can boast companions such as these. Hence, all ye little bards! F. Restrain thy gall, Does modern merit claim no praise at all? Shall not applause attend on Southey's strain? Must Byron, Scott, and Rogers sing in vain! P. Think not to such, applause I would deny, Or view their beauties with a jaundic'd eye; I mark each nobler effort of the Lyre, I feel a poet's warmth, and must admire. But when you speak of that poor bauble, Fame;â How few deserve it! Yet what numbers claim. To Southey, well combin'd, at once belong Truth, grandeur, force, variety of song; All that exalted genius can inspire, A poet's rashness, with a poet's fire. But still his faults (this candour must allow, Spite of the courtly laurel on his brow), Would mar the force of many a modern rhyme, And quite obscure a genius less sublime. Whene'er I read (nor think me too severe,) Aught childish in his works that grates my ear, I turn to Madoc's grand, sublimer lays, And hate the line that speaks in his dispraise. F. To Scott you'll grant some portion of renown; The man has pleas'dâ P. Ay, surfeited the town.â Th' inconstant town! that, like a pert coquet, Can smile, adore, discard, abuse, forget! Some deep romantic scene, where mould'ring time Has mark'd each tow'r and battlement sublime; Where barbarous mirth, revenge, and feudal rage Shew the rude manners of a former age; Romances, by tradition only known, He paints with life and vigour all his own. The town is pleas'd when Byron will rehearse, And finds a thousand beauties in his verse; So fix'd his fameâthat, write whate'er he will, The patient public must admire it still: Yes,âthough bereft of half his force and fire, They still must read, and, dozing, must admire; While you and I, who stick to common sense, To genius, taste, and wit, have no pretence. Throughout the whole, we toil to understand; Where'er we treadâ'tis strange, 'tis foreign land; Nay, half the thoughts and language of the strain Require a glossary to make them plain. Beauties there are, which, candour bids me own, Atone for theseâfor more than these atone:â Beautiesâwhich e'en the coldest must admireâ Quick, high-wrought passionâtrue poetic fireâ Bold, energetic languageâthoughts sublimeâ And all the artful cadences of rhyme. Nor less, for sterling genius, I admire Rogers' pure style, and Campbell's noble fire; Montgomery's strain to taste and feeling true, That speaks the poet and the christian too. Blest be the man with all that fame can give, Who burst the Negro's chain, and bade him live; Blest be the bard with glory's brightest meed, Whose glowing verse immortaliz'd the deed. Far as th' Atlantic rolls his rapid stream, A race shall hail the poet and his theme; And waft the sound to Guinea's distant shore, That tells her children they are slaves no more. The praise we justly give to truth divine, Who can withhold from Crabbe's unerring line? A bard by no pedantic rules confin'd, A rigid painter of the human mind. And long as Nature in her simplest guise, And virtuous sensibility we prize, Of well-earn'd fame no poet shall enjoy A fairer tribute than âThe Farmer's Boy.â Hail to departed worth!âsee Scotland turns, With tardy hand, to raise the tomb of Burns. Ah, spare the fame such frail memorials give! In his own works enshrin'd, the bard shall live. Of humble birth, but with a taste refin'd, An adverse fortune, with a god-like mind; He silent bore, but keenly felt the smart, Till bitter disappointment broke his heart. O! when releas'd, his ardent spirit fled, How envy smil'd, how virtue mourn'd the dead, And Scotland's hills heard ev'ry tongue proclaim The minstrel's glory, and his country's shame.â Then, with the poet's fate inscribe his bust; In life neglectedâcanoniz'd in dust! Hail to departed worth! o'er Cowper's bier Let genius pause,âand drop her holiest tear: To White's cold turf, a weeping pilgrim turn, And crown with bays her Grahame's hallow'd urn: 'Twas theirs to shun the poet's flowery way, Of them religion ask'd a nobler lay; And well their lives its sacred influence caught, And justified the precepts which they taught. Religion, meek, benevolent, refin'd, Breathes universal love to all mankind; And acting on this principle alone, Weeps for another's sorrows as her own. Soft is her voice, and humble are her ways; Warm is her heart, and fervent is her praise; Fair deeds of virtue all her hours employ, She chides with meekness, and forgives with joy: Happy the soul that feels her ray divine, (A ray which sainted Porteus beam'd in thine,) With conscious pleasure she reviews the past, And confident in faith, awaits her last. F. Why, this is praise! P. Not greater than is due: I can withhold applause, and give it too; Above deceit, I scorn all venal ways; I freely censure, and I freely praise. If Dudley call me ranc'rous, decent knight! When he grows wiser, I'll grow more polite; Till then I laugh at ceremony's rules, And still include him in my list of fools. F. Why name you him? P. To bring before the town A courtly coxcomb, though he wears a gown; A journalistâand such a one, heav'n knows! I will not, reader, to offend thy nose, Rake up the dunghill of his filthy prose. Yet he can flatter with an awkward grace; Like some old dowager who chalks her face, He daubs so coarsely to display the saint, That the grey sinner stares beneath the paint. Let Manners, just escap'd from durance vile, Abuse, defame me, in his Grub-Street style; In some catch-penny pamphlet, penn'd complete, Conceiv'd, begotten, born within the Fleet: Let Scott, the Champion, railâwith scorn I view The worst that Dulness and her sons can do; So, Fortune, save my character and lays From Dudley's hireling, prostituted praise. When Pasquin, arm'd with libels, stalks by night, Lest prowling bailiffs intercept his flight; Pasquin, dull rogue! who twenty years has made His pamphlets turn a profitable trade; How ???? dreads the vengeance of his muse, And ???, who has no character to lose, Quakes in his dark retreat; while you and I, With upright confidence, his rage defy. Unhappy Pasquin! in thy latter days Few fear thy wrath, none barter for thy praise; But all thy pointless darts, at random thrown, Hurt no one's name, but only dân thine own. Stands Scotland where it did? alas! no moreâ Since truant Jeffrey flies his native shore: For who among her sons, to speed their gains, (Her sons more fam'd for brimstone, than for brains,) Like him, retrac'd the path which Kenrick trod, Traduc'd his country, and blasphem'd his God? Mourn, Caledonia! let thy rocks reply; Not leaden Sydney can his loss supply:â Too dull, alas! to satisfy a picque; His heart is willing, but his brain is weak: Nor Holland's spouse, nor Holland's mantling bowl, Can rouse from torpor his benighted soul. Illustrious Holland! doom'd by angry fate To rack the Muses, and reform the State; Consistent Peer! unstain'd with courtly crimes, Save some few venial spots, and doggerel rhymes; His Jeffrey lost,âshall haply mount the throne, And execrate all dulnessâbut his own. What, though the grave may end the poet's care, The spleen of Chalmers still pursues him there; Scarce would th' ungrateful world allow him room, Yet Chalmers tears the laurel from his tomb; And where some frailty asks a pitying tear, He frowns, and plays the moralist severe. Welcome each dunce of Cibber's lively school! But save me from the solemn, canting fool; The heavy pedant, the laborious drone, Full of old saws and dogmas of his own. Be not severe, though error hath beguil'd A son of light, the Muses' wondrous child, Unhappy Chatterton! whom none would save, An outcast, from the cradle to the grave. Bright be thy place of everlasting rest!â The all-sufficient Power who knew thee best, Shall judge theeâto th' eternal fiat trustâ Vain is the wrath of man, since God is just! He saw thy youth by great ambition led, Beheld thy haggard form, unhous'd, unfed; Watch'd o'er thy pillow, mark'd thy troubled sleep, Heard ev'ry bitter groan, and saw thee weep, Till thy proud spirit, from its daring height Plung'd to the dark abyss of endless night. F. Some play, or farce that gallery, box, and pit Applaud for solid sense and sterling wit, Name;â P. Why, methinks no puzzling task were this: âThe Trav'llers,â âSleeping Beauty,â âHit or Miss!â Such scenes as Cherry, Skeffington produce, And rivall'd but by Punch and Mother Goose. Our modern playwrights, unambitious elves, Trust to the actor, more than to themselves; Some odd peculiarity they hit, A shrug, or wink, well manag'd, pass for wit; And Liston's idiot stare, and Oxb'ry's bray, Have sav'd (with shame I speak it,) many a play. Would you to rapture raise the vulgar throng, Let Mathews play the fool, and sing his song; A thousand tongues shall roar at Fawcett's croak, And Munden's jaws pass current for a joke. F. Why slumbers Sheridan in this dull age? Why thus a willing truant from the stage? Views he unmov'd the sickly taste that draws Dishonest fame, and panders for applause? Why not revive the times that once have been, When wit and humour grac'd the comic scene; And Folly, dragg'd before the public view, Blush'd to behold her image drawn so true? P. Would wit and humour please the noisy crowd, When Dibdin, Dimond, Reynolds, croak so loud? How would the boxes storm, the galleries rage, To see their favourites banish'd from the stage; And call aloud, ere sense could be restor'd, For Laurent's grin, and Ridgway's magic sword? Heav'ns! could such scenes engage the public mind, Did virtue, truth, or sense remain behind? In vain we boast of Shakespeare's mighty pow'r, For musick now must charm the vacant hour; Otway, no more we drop a tear with thee, For song and dance are all we hear and see; Except when Kemble, to delight the few, Restores immortal Shakespeare to our view. Rais'd with the sound, what visions fire my brain! The Bard revives! the Actor breathes again! Ages roll back from time's destructive doom, The Chiefs, the Sages of imperial Rome, With solemn port, and awe-commanding eye, In native majesty come sweeping by.â All passions roseâfear, horror, madness, rage, Alternate mov'd when Siddons trod the stage;â Then reign'd the tragick Muse, enthron'd on high, Awe in her mien, and lightning in her eye! Mark'd ye that solemn pause, that whisper dread, That quick terrific start?ââTo Bed, to Bed!ââ In Jaffier's frantic wife, that steadfast grief, Which knows no intermission, no relief, But preys upon the mind, distracts the brain, And gives all uncontroll'd the passions reign, Till madness, while usurping Reason's throne, Starts at the Form she knows to be her own?â Ye who have seen the full meridian blaze, The glorious light of long departed days, When justly to declare, the task was hard, Which triumph'd most; the actor, or the bardâ Shall mournâthe voice, that mute attention draws, The speaking eye, that fills up ev'ry pause, Should their regard from fleeting memory claim, And live, but by traditionary fame. Blest be the Painter's art, by which we trace The various wonders of the actor's face; That brings, to nature and expression true, Each passion, look, and gesture forth to view; And gives that record art alone can give, And bids to future times the semblance live. Long time elaps'd ere Shakespeare's hand divine Brought nature's stores to light, and bade them shine; Ere truth the cloud of ignorance dispell'd, Which the dark mind in willing bondage held: Then nature, irresistible and strong, In floods of boundless passion pour'd along, And spurning art's pedantic, dull control, O'erwhelm'd with magic pow'r the captive soul. Long may Britannia feel the ardent flame, And boast his glorious, his immortal name; From age to age the glowing theme prolong; And future poets emulate his song:â Like him, sublime on daring wing to soar To passion's boldest heights, unknown before; And blend triumphant in the British lyre, The Grecian softness with the Roman fire. 'Tis not enough that the rude gallery folks Admire thy genius, and applaud thy jokes; That clapping theatres the benches shake Less for thy merit, than contention's sake; Bold in thyself, uphold the Drama's laws; Nor basely pander for a mob's applause. To win, employ the graces of thy style, Not the loud laugh, but the approving smile: To Hook and Dimond leave the noisy crew, Content to number the judicious few; Nor let thy wit, like bards of little worth, Offend our reason, to provoke our mirth. Once 'twas the fashion, in an earlier day, For two, at least one plot, to form a play; But our sage authors frugally dispense With plots; nay moreâwith nature, wit, and sense; Through five long acts their weary audience lull, Most cold and tasteless, most perversely dull. For me, no blind disciple of the schools That laugh and cry by Aristotle's rules; I loathe the fool whose humour lies in trick, While sentimental trumpery makes me sick; And âOhs!â and âAhs!â and âDammes!â modern wit,â Can please me never, though they please the pit. Yet not a cynic, nor devour'd by spleen, I needs must smile if Colman grace the scene; Let humour broad, with polish'd wit combine, No faculties more risible than mine: But shall I laugh because some antic droll Squints in my face?âI cannot for my soul! F. Morton writes comedy. P. I'd quite forgotâ Without the aid of character or plot. Is Morton right?âthen wrong are ancient schools, And Congreve, Farq'har, Wycherley were fools, Who thought true wit to comedy allied, And studied nature as their surest guide. Humour he has, I grant, but much too low, And high-flown sentiment, and fustian woe; To each extreme incautious Morton runs, His pathos moves more laughter than his puns. F. I'll name O' Keefe.â P. I can't be grave with him, A rare compound of oddity and whim! His native ease, his quaint amusing style, And wit grotesque would make a stoic smile. Ye who have laugh'd when Lingo trod the stage, (Before this dull and sentimental age,) Be grateful for the merriment he gave, And smooth his cheerless passage to the grave. Tread lightly hereâfor though no marble weeps, 'Tis sacred groundâbeneath, a poet sleeps:â Spare flatt'ry now, it cannot charm his ear, But give the silent tribute of a tear. Lamented Tobin!âbut the muse disdains To mark with sorrow her indignant strains, A prouder joy might swell her glowing page,â Thy scenes have half-redeem'd our modern stage. In times like these, when ev'ry forward dunce Starts up, good Lord! a dramatist at once, Could Jonson riseâhow vain were his essay, Some nauseous wit would bear the palm away; Yes! though perforce we hail a Jonson dead, A living Jonson p'rhaps might beg his bread. F. Say who's to blame? P. The sottish town, that pays The fool with laughter; not the bard with praise; That looks for, in distortion and grimace, Nature's soft ease, and wit's enchanting grace.â You blame my taste, if careless 'midst the roar, When noble critics hiccup out âEncore!â As Catalini, charming queen of sounds, Sings a bravuraâfor a hundred pounds; Or blythe Dehayes, all life and spirit, swims Through the gay dance, and twirls his pliant limbs, I sit unmov'd, a cold phlegmatic guest, Nor cry âEncore!â and âBravo!â like the rest: Form'd in a coarser mould, untaught by art, I love the plainer language of the heart; No far-fetch'd song that strains the lab'ring throat, No squeaking eunuch's soft Italian note; No attitude obscene, 'gainst nature's plan, Which more bespeaks the monkey than the man. Merit, stand byâfor lo! with servile leer Some warbling Signior, elbow'd by a peer, A supple slave, now banter'd, now caress'd, Kick'd, laugh'd at, worshipp'd,âas my Lord thinks best! Advances forth, obligingly polite, To charm his friendsâfor fifty pounds per night. 'Tis foreign allâno native talent here With artless, simple notes delights the ear; But sounds that least of harmony partake, Much lengthen'd quaver, and affected shake; A heterogeneous massâGod help the while! Which p'rhaps the cognoscenti christen âStyle.â Thus fool'dâand thus instructed by the tribe, Their follies, with their pleasures, we imbibe, Till, by degrees we grow, like them, debas'd, Corrupt in morals, as deprav'd in taste. This shameful truth let slighted genius tell,â In vain in arts Britannia's sons excel, Since Britain proves, through prejudice alone, A friend to ev'ry genius, but her own. O were the good old times again restor'd! When wine and welcome cheer'd the festive board; When ev'ry feast excell'd the banquet past, And each new year prov'd happier than the last. Our Shakespeare, who, on fam'd Parnassus' mount Sat high enthron'd, and from the sacred fount Of Helicon drank deeply, 'till the stream Lull'd the rapt bard to many a heav'nly dream, Lov'd pastimes, manly sports, and rural bow'rs, And archeries, and may-poles wreath'd with flow'rs. High be the wassail-bowl with holly crown'd! Quick let the carol and the cup go round! Bring verdure from the forest and the plain, Till Birnam-Wood do come to Dunsinane! Far be the cant of true sectarian birth, Whose presence is an antidote to mirth; Hush'd be the voice that would our sports annoy, In one loud strain of universal joy. Let the world wag for me, while fortune sends Old books, old wine, old customs, and old friends! F. Old wine, I grant,âthe bees-wing, and the crust!â P. Old booksâ F. Old books! Cuibono? but their dust! You boast the ancient, I the modern lore.â P. Which saysâjust what our fathers said before; Save their high thoughts, harmoniously express'd, Crave audience in a party-colour'd vest, Right gaudy, and mere tinsel at the best. F. Who reads the Classics now? the wits of Anne! Shelv'd, out of date, forgotten to a man! Who quotes the mighty Aristarch with awe? Whose voice was thunder, and whose word was law. Who wanders musing through the churchyard way, Led by the tender muse of pensive Gray? Or weeps at Auburn's tale? or starts to hear The mingled chords of madness, rage, and fear, Struck by the bard who, while his lyre he strung, Too keenly felt One Passion that he sung? Lost are their names, their glories but a dream,â P. Lost in the murky smoke of gas and steam! To rise more glorious like refulgent day, When time has blown those noxious clouds away! Dear sons of fame! by fond rememb'rance ting'dâ On Thames' fair banks, and Isis' willow-fring'd, Wand'ring, ye bade my youthful bosom glow With harmless joy, or melt with chast'ning woe. Since first ye taught me gen'rous love of fame, How all is chang'dâbut Ye are still the same; My spirit lacks its fire, my head is gray, And friends belov'd have dropp'd, and died away; But Ye, to whom I owe the pleasing past, My earliest friends, are faithful to the last! Let me not live till palsied, wither'd age Shall dim the charms of your immortal page; Contract my soul within its narrow bound, Where sordid love of Self is only found, Av'rice, distrust, oblivion, peevish gloomâ Let me not liveâbut âgive some labourer room.â Glad to depart, yet grateful to have been, To see what now I see, and what I've seen; Health, friendship, books, I would not, wanting these, The Wine of Life, with dotards dreg the lees. How Dulness smil'd on that auspicious morn, When high enthron'd, the butt of public scorn, She pompous saw her sapient Arnold sit In Drury's fane the arbiter of wit. âMy son,â the joyful mother cried, and then Into his trembling fingers thrust a pen, âSomething thou shalt produceâno matter what, An old romance supplies thee with a plot; Then steal or borrow to cajole the folks, Tom D' Urfey's madrigals, and Miller's Jokes: All these together in confusion thrown, Well sprinkled with some nonsense of thine own; And some odd scraps, by Colman thrown away, Will (Holt can answer for it,) make a play. Long may'st thou live to prove the scourge of sense, And nurture Folly at a large expense! To catch each novelty, howe'er absurd; And raise all hell, as Faustus gives the word. Though Polito, to make the people stare, Erect his annual booth at Smithfield Fair, Where lions roar with wide distended jaws, And grinning serpents hiss with vast applause; How vain are all his efforts to outdo!â Old Drury's stage shall boast its monsters too. But if, with equal emulation fir'd, Thy rival Harris hath each monster hir'd, (A genuine son, a kindred spirit he, And second in my love to none but thee;) Let Raymond take some fierce Rhinoceros' shape, And Oxb'ry be transform'd into an Ape; Next let thy talents find their proper use, Do thou, as best becomes thee, play the Goose; Then all shall own, while they admire the cast, Thou'st found thy fittest character at last! See how my children in one cause unite, Lo, Larpent reads! while Hook and Reynolds write; Dull Brinsley sleeps, and should he wake again, I fear some revolution in our reign; But Kotzebue's bombast, fearing to expire, Stole the last spark of his immortal fire.â To drain our wealth what numbers cross the main; Fiddlers from France, and mountebanks from Spain; From Italy a host of warbling slaves, From Holland grave Mynheers, egregious knaves. There Indian jugglers ply their trade for hire, And here a Prussian lady swallows fire; While rushing crowds assemble far and near, What to behold?âa Cossack and his spear! When Polito might gratify their view With sights as ugly, and as human too. But most to thee, O Germany! we owe Our choicest stock of rarities below; Counts, gamesters, princes, jostling side by side, Thy low-born offal, and thy high-dutch pride, All who for wit or want their country leave, Kind, we invite; and grateful, we receive; Thus cramm'dâimpos'd on much beyond our due; 'Tis hard, methinks, to send us poets too! Our taste is Germanâand our wives will say, How pure the doctrine of a German play! Where vice appears so innocently dress'd, We almost fancy cuckoldom a jest; For the frail nymph so well her crime defends, The couple weep, embrace, and soon are friends! Nor stop we hereâstrange farragos succeed, (âOh, horrible! most horrible, indeed!â) Undaunted Ireland dares the mighty test, Although, in raising spirits and the rest, Lewis without a rival stands confest. Though sprites appear obedient at his will, Ghosts are but ghosts; and demons, demons still; Alike in matter, and in form the same: Hobgoblins differ onlyâin the name: Yet Lewis trembles lest his fame be won, And Mistress Radcliffe fears herself outdone. But these are harmless, Satire must confess, To the loose novels of Minerva's press; Such melting tales as Meeke and Rosa tell; For pious Lane, who knows his readers well, Can suit all palates with their diff'rent food, Love for the hoyden, morals for the prude! Behold! with reams of nonsense newly born, Th'industrious pack who scribble night and morn; Five pounds per volume! an enormous bribe, Enough, methinks, to tempt a hungry scribe. First Lady Morgan, Amazonian Fair! (Ye gods, what will not Lady Morgan dare?) With four octavo volumes shocks the sight; For who can read as fast as she can write? Next fair Llewellyn, modestly indeed, Would have us name her works, as well as read; Which to perform, in language just and brief, Let âbawdryâ be inscrib'd on every leaf. Matilda toils the promis'd boon to win, And Ann of Swansea wades through thick and thin; While Bridget Bluemantle's eternal scrawl Makes truly more waste paper than them all. Would you with blushes tinge the virgin cheek, Read âMidnight Weddings,â penn'd by Mrs. Meeke: Soft amorous stories by Honoria Scott, Of ravishments, seductions, and what not: Or Gunning's tales, for Gunning, to my taste, Is sprightly, witty, any thingâbut chaste: Or âRival Princes,â anger's latest spark, Pride of them all, and worthy Mrs. Clarke. I pass in silence, authors not a few; Cervantes Hogg, and all the Grub Street Crew: Alas! more worthy of contempt than rage, Their worthless names would but defile my page: The muse shall never gibbet them on high, Obscurely as they liv'd, so let them die. F. 'Tis pitifulâbut why indulge your spleen? Will all this harsh invective mend the scene? Your satire is too pointed, too severe, And little suited to the public ear. My Lord, who now and then, to serve his ends, Invites some score of literary friends, Will meet you at his table with an air That plainly tells you have no bus'ness there. âYe Gods!â he cries, âshall I, who think sublime Matilda's motley hash of prose and rhyme, By one, who begs a dinner at my door, Be school'dâand play âSir Oracleâ no more?â P. I guess you wellâhenceforth no verse of mine Shall question Rose's title to âdivine;â No more in critic gall I'll dip my quill, Let Feist and Croker scribble what they will; Let piddling Gwilliam void his riff-raff stuff, And damn'd be he that first cries âHold, enough!â F. Wisely resolv'dâsince this contention ends, All Grub Street and the court shall prove your friends; Brisk maids of honour quit their fond amours, And Little's prurient page, to gloat on yours! Why always Satire? choose some milder theme. P. âSoft! 'tis the music of yon murm'ring streamâ F. Pshaw! the mere cant of ev'ry tuneful tongueâ P. Then say, what scenes has nature yet unsung? The time has been, when many a rural lay I tried, as life pass'd airily away; But grief and care, the inroads time has made, Have cast o'er all a melancholy shade. E'en now, I hasten to my last retreat, Soon this too anxious heart shall cease to beat; Some filial tears be o'er my memory shed, And those who lov'd me living, mourn me dead. Has pitying Heaven an early fate design'd, It still shall find me grateful and resign'd: Well pleas'd to share, at life's eventful close, The scorn of all whom most I wish'd my foes. For Dryden never fear'd with manly rage To lash the full-grown vices of the age, But, spurning what he thought dishonest fame, Call'd ev'ry rogue and blockhead by his name; Thus Shadwell's dulness, Shaftsbury's baser crimes, Are handed down to all succeeding times. Pope (who retains pre-eminence, in spite Of all that Weston, all that Bowles could write,) To conquer vice the surest method found, He aim'd with care to give the deeper wound: And counting titles, wealth, inferior things, To Virtue gave what he deny'd to Kings. And shall the Muse, freeborn, to none a slave, Unbrib'd, unbought, by any fool or knave; A votary oft at Freedom's holy shrine, Check the just warmth of her satiric line? Free let it flow while truth directs its course, Strong in its tide, resistless in its force; And shame the hoary pimp, the courtly tool, The bold-fac'd villain, and the harmless fool. Shall Britain, spot of heaven's peculiar care, Her sons so warlike, and her nymphs so fair, Whose envied fame is borne on ev'ry breeze As waves her flag majestic o'er the seas; Shall Britain see her liberties despis'd, Once jealously maintain'd, and dearly priz'd, And silently behold her court outblaze The rank obscenity of Charles's days? Shall vice make virtue crouch beneath her feet, And grey seduction prowl from street to street; And sins too black and horrible to name, In her unhappy land be thought no shame? Shall Scripture, blessed fount of truth divine, Which made by holy faith the Saviour mine, And taught me through this dark sojourn to see, Although a wanderer, he died for me, By daring infidels, and fools at best, Be boldly call'd a fable and a jest? And O! to make her infamy complete, Shall Truth and Justice quit the judgment-seat, And Law, her strong defence in former times, Uphold the guilty, and defend their crimes? Shall sins like these, which loud for vengeance call, And urge a tottering nation to its fall, Unbridled reign, and Satire's voice be dumb? Nor warn a guilty land of wrath to come? I willââ F. Fine words! lash blockheads to the bone, But leave, my friend, pray leave the Great alone; The sons of dulness, they were made for sport, But spare, for prudence sake, O spare the Court! My Lord, whose frown keeps modest Truth in awe, Array'd in all the terrors of the law, Suspends his legal vengeance.â P. Let it fall;â One smile from Virtue makes amends for all; A Jefferies' rage can ne'er my terrors raise, I scorn his censure, as I hate his praise. Thou (if a voice, still true to virtue's cause, Dare give neglected honesty applause,) Who, free from private pique, from party zeal, Canst like a poet write, a patriot feel, Accept my verse; relax thy brow awhile, Nor scorn my labours for their homely style. If now and then a happier line appear, And sound with sweeter music in thine ear; A brighter thought, in which thou seest combin'd Sound judgment, fertile fancy, strength of mind; Such as may justly claim thy meed of praise, And call to mind the bards of former days; 'Tis all I hopeâbut far from me be those Who flatter Grenville's rhyme, or Dibdin's prose; Phlegmatic judges, who unmov'd can sit, And Arnold's ribaldry mistake for wit; O'er Dimond's puling scenes lament and sigh, With Skeffington or Godwin laugh and cry; And O! (what wonders we may live to see,) Think, Maturin, mighty Shakespeare rivals Thee! Let such dull loungers (if they rise so soon) At dry rehearsals spend their time till noon; To billiards stroll, or half asleep peruse The vague abortions of Fitzgerald's muse; Then at Albina's rout complete the yawn, With her blue-stocking friends, and gape till dawn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VIRGIL IN LONDON; OR, TOWN ECLOGUES. TO WHICH ARE ADDED, IMITATIONS OF HORACE. FIRST PRINTED IN THE YEAR 1814. THIRD EDITION. INTRODUCTORY DIALOGUE. LADY ? AND AUTHOR. Lady. What! Virgil in London?â'twill never go downâ He'll meet but a sorry reception in town; His manners are coarse, and his language, you know (As Dryden translates), is exceedingly low; An old fashion'd poet, whose obsolete rhymes Will ne'er suit the taste of these whimsical times; Unlike Thomas Little, all pathos and passion, A Bard, that, I'm sure, will be always in fashion! But what hieroglyphics are these that I see?â Lord F?with a dash, and the Countess of D?, No scandal, I hope.â Author. Not a stroke of ill-nature, All sober hilarity, good-humour'd satire; My Muse, no prim quakeress, straight, and tightlac'dâ Will, I hope, prove a nymph to your Ladyship's taste. Lady. But why thus confine your poetical rage? Give scope to your talents, and write for the stage; 'Tis a second-hand task o'er the classics to pore, And Virgil has had his translators before. Author. The Stage!â'twere in vain for your poet to try, No half-witted melo-dramatist am I. Lady. Write a poem in Erseâ Author. And provoke the Reviews! What! rival the chaste Caledonian Muse? Lady. Then conjure up Spirits, and boldly advance A champion for fame in the field of Romance; Try Politicsâthey 've been the fashion of late!â Turn criticâbut ne'er condescend to translate. Author. Though pedants may rail, though the learned may frown, Still Virgil shall make his appearance in town. A masquerade, pic-nic, a grand city ball, A Carlton House fÃªte, or a squeeze at Vauxhall, The play-house, the park, and occasional news, Shall furnish right popular themes for his Muse. How like you the thought? Lady. Why, the subject is witty, 'Tis a novel idea, and exceedingly pretty! For Virgil to sing, when he travels from home, The fashions of London as well as of Rome.â The grave with the gay, you must skilfully blend; If dull, you will tire; if severe, you'll offend; Be cautious, and take the advice of a friend. Author. Ye Critics! before whose tribunal severe, As a dutiful bard, I am bound to appear; To a poet be merciful once in your lives, And spare him the smarts of your critical knives! If sometimes, a truant from classical rules, His muse take a license unknown to the schools, Reflect, Alma-mater is nothing to him, A laughing disciple of frolic and whim; Nor scalp a poor author for trifles like these, Who strives to amuse, and whose aim is to please. ECLOGUE I. THE RETIRED CITIZEN TO HIS FRIEND IN TOWN. Fortunate Senex, hic inter flumina nota, Et fontes sacros, frigus captabis opacum. VIRGIL, ECLOGA I. While you, M?, fond of noise and strife, Endure the bustle of a city life, Content with Mopsa, your enamour'd bride, To breathe the smoky vapours of Cheapside; I, far remov'd from busy scenes like these, Enjoy the morning sun, the evening breeze, To rural prospects unrepining go, While life has yet some pleasures to bestow. Let sordid misers ev'ry art employ In heaping gold for others to enjoy; Let sober cits, resolv'd to take a trip, Give once a year their customers the slip, And rashly dare (anticipating joy) The ten-fold horrors of a Margate hoy; Let them, good folks! forsake the town in droves, And idly stray through Dandelion's groves, Or, proud to show a daughter's clumsy air, Half-stifled in a ball-room, strut and stare; Let them, in shuffling cards and throwing dice, Expend a twelvemonth's profits in a trice, And, cursing inwardly their journey down, With empty pockets travel back to town;â Beneath a shade I take my cheerful glass, Nor let the precious moments idly pass; Those blissful moments, which, in age we learn Too swiftly vanish'd, never to return. For wealth, the most desir'd of earthly things, Is only useful for the joys it brings; And let me never tauntingly be told I simply barter'd happiness for gold. Let me, ere gouty ills, a direful train, Disturb my rest, and rack my joints with pain, Or cough consumptive, when I mount the stairs, With hollow sound, delight my greedy heirs, Improve by mirth this remnant of my span, And gaily cut a caper while I can; For age is not a time for roguish tricks, And few can dance a reel at sixty-six. Our neighbour Gripus left his shop and till, To breathe the purer air of Greenwich-hill, To taste the soft delights of rural bow'rs, But not till age had frozen all his pow'rs: Scarce to these scenes of pleasure did he go, Ere gout, relentless, fasten'd on his toe; Although, to shorten his declining life, He lack'd no better torment than his wife. Old Discount, who, in forty years' retreat, Had snuff'd the wholesome air of Lombard-street, First felt his sudden passion to retire, When Farmer Gubbins, o'er a Christmas fire, Declar'd what sterling joy the country yields, And prais'd his dogs, his horses, and his fields. To leave the town, and rusticate dispos'd, His books are balanc'd, his accounts are clos'd; In landed sureties he invests his gains, And not one debt unsatisfied remains: He builds, he plants, and counts his future years, When Death, a ruthless creditor, appears: Enough, that Discount did his life employ In hoarding richesâlet his heirs enjoy. While yet my limbs are sound, and health remains, While yet the blood runs freely through my veins, Ere watchful Time, with slow and silent pace, Engraves a thousand wrinkles on my face; Ere yet my eyes grow dim, my hearing fail, I'll climb the hill, and wander through the vale; Hear the sweet Lark salute the rising day, And Philomela pour her evening lay; Or with some chosen friend, in woodbine bow'r, In social converse pass the cheerful hour, Talk of our youthful days in merry vein, And act our sports and gambols o'er again; For many a sport had I, at many a time, In youth's gay spring, when life was in its prime! On Sabbath-days some visitor comes down, And brings me all the latest news from town; How many Frenchmen we have put to flight, And who is made a bankrupt, who a knight. Proud of my snug retirement, ere we dine I show my guest my cattle and my kine, My well-stor'd greenhouse, warm and trimly neat, Where social plants from ev'ry climate meet; My young plantation, full of vernal shoots, My summer blossoms and autumnal fruits. Happy old Man! my house and grounds my own, I envy not the monarch on his throne. What though the dust in summer blind my eyes, And bleak and cold the wint'ry tempests rise, No noisy fish-wife bellows me to death, No rank unwholesome vapours stop my breath. Happy old Man! here, in my country box, And fruitful fields, I learn the price of stocks, As from my woodbine arbour, green and gay, (The Hampstead stages passing twice a-day,) My only daughter, zealous to amuse My fond impatience, reads the weekly news! Then come, my friend! 'tis nature's self invites; Leave London's toilsome days and anxious nights; Indulgent Heav'n has multiplied thy store, Enough for thee, and canst thou wish for more? To rival patriots leave the sinking state, Nor hope to show thy talent for debate.â Here, in the midst of exercise and health, Thy mind shall learn the real use of wealth; In stepping wide from Mammon's sordid elves, And doing good to others, and ourselves. ECLOGUE II. ALEXIS. Beneath a shade, near Inner-Temple Lane, Sat fond Alexis, a despairing swain; A lawyer he, whom cruel love in sport Had driv'n, relentless, from the Inns of Court: Who, since he bow'd to little Cupid's yoke, Had thought no more of Lyttelton and Coke, But tun'd his plaintive harp to grief alone, And Gray's-Inn gardens answer'd to his moan. âAh! Easter Monday! Day for ever dear! Thou blithesome herald of the vernal year; To me, alone, thou prov'st a galling smart, For on thy luckless day I lost my heart. Fair shone the rosy morn, at six I rose, And view'd with eager eyes my Sunday clothes; Th' embroider'd vest, the pantaloons so trim; The high-crown'd modish hat with narrow brim; The hessian boot, the coat with taper skirt, The stiff-starch'd cravat, and the ruffled shirt! Thus nattily equipp'd, a London spark! I march'd with hasty step to Greenwich Park; Through clouds of dust I bent my joyous way, With song and whistle, for my heart was gay; But little thinking I should find, ere night, My heart so heavy, and my purse so light. Ye Muses of Apollo's sacred hill, Whom once I woo'd, (and let me woo ye still!) When, warm with passion and the rural scene, I sung the blue-ey'd Maid of Stepney Green, Teach me once more to sing my am'rous pains, And Blouzelinda's charms in equal strains. A gipsy hat her auburn hair confin'd, Save some stray locks that sported in the wind; And nature, bounteous nature, bade disclose Her neck the lily, and her cheek the rose. Long has the maid my youthful bosom fir'd, Her beauty long my simple lay inspir'd; I saw her charms unfolding ev'ry hour, Fair was the bud, but fairer is the flower! As lately at the river's brink I stood, In meditation deep, at Hornsey Wood, I, while the sun delay'd his parting beam, Beheld my face reflected in the stream; My eyes look'd bright, with diffidence I speak, And youthful blushes glow'd upon my cheek; I mark'd my form, to Vestris no disgrace, Where just proportion vied with manly grace: But, since these beauties charm my love no more, I shun the fountains that I sought before; From billiards, rackets, quoits, and cricket flee;â And taw and skittles have no charms for me. Canst thou forget, when, warm with love and ale, I whisper'd in thine ear my tender tale? How didst thou blush at Cupid's soft command, (The glass of negus trembling in thy hand!) And sighing, promise everlasting truth, If I would take thee but to Saunders' booth, To see the tailor, in equestrian pride, With crupper, whip, and spur, to Brentford ride? Did I not show thee ev'ry kind of fun;â Cows with two heads, that never had but one; Sage necromancers, who, to conjuring prone, Tell ev'ry body's fortunes but their own; And Lady Morgan short, and Patrick tall? No Yorkshire club was oursâI paid for all. Yes, cruel maid! and no reward I seek, Though that day's flourish made me fast a week; Bear witness to my vows, ye pow'rs above! I ask no other payment, but thy love; No fonder pledge I crave, my lovely girl, Than that thou gav'st me o'er a pint of purl! Come to my longing arms, my lovely care! And take the presents which the gods prepare! The macaroni cake, the Chelsea bun, And almonds crisp, and raisins of the sun: But what avails it that I yield my store? The purse-proud Daphnis still will offer more, And Blouzelinda has too sweet a tooth, To scorn his gifts, and wed the poorest youth. In splendid courts, let haughty princes reign, The shepherd loves the forest and the plain:â The prowling dun the hungry bard pursues, The politician travels after news, The unpaid tailor dogs the London spark, The curious hunt the Cossack through the parkâ Each has his diff'rent hobby:âby this rule, Sir Claudius plays the courtier, Coates the fool, My Lord the jockey, Skeffington the beau, And Love's my hobby, wheresoe'er I go. Resound, ye hills! resound my mournful strain, Of perjur'd Blouzelinda I complain!â The doctor tries his Esculapian skill, He draws the lancet, and prescribes the pill, And lays for Cupid many an artful lure; But love's a pang that physic cannot cure; A ruthless dun, devoted to his prey, By night tormenting, as he plagues by day. But see, the night emits unwholesome damps, And nimble link-boys run to light their lamps; Now strolls the painted Cyprian in the dark, I'll to the Basin, in St. James's Park:â Farewell! the lawyer's quirk, the pleader's bawl; The Temple, Lincoln's-Inn, and Justice-Hall! Farewell! the park, the play-house, and Pall-Mall! Blouzy, adieu!âand all the world, farewell! ECLOGUE III. THE DISCARDED MINISTER. Amicus. Ho! Georgius, whither on thy way so fast, From good St. Stephen's? Georgius. Ah! my friend; at last, (Would I had never liv'd, this day to see, Strange revolution for the state and me!) His Highness, who has ow'd me long a grudge, Exclaims, âYou cringing ragamuffin, budge! A fellow, that to serve his private ends, Gives ev'ry place of profit to his friends! No more I'll have a herd of Scotch petitioners, Clerks of the crown, or Navy-board commissioners.â Ami. But what will now become of your colleagues, Their ways and means, their councils, their intrigues? What other leader will they choose? Geo. Heav'n knows! I weep to think of leaving Treasurer Rose; Methinks I hear him cry, distracted, vext, âForebodings tell me that my turn comes next!â And then the honest man dissolves in tears, To lose the place he's held for twenty years. Ami. And Vansittart, will royalty reject him? Geo. Ah! no: impassive Dulness shall protect him: He has no dang'rous particle of sense, But all is solidâshillings, pounds, and pence, 'Tis not in pious Nicholas to think; Suffice it, that he uses pens and ink, To calculate with nicety the sum Of new imposts and taxes yet to come. Ami. What will they do with Ryder, let me ask? âAn oracle within an empty cask!â He rises,âwith the awful subject big, And shakes the powder'd honours of his wig; He speaks;âa mute attention fills the House, The mountain is deliver'd of its mouse. Geo. He, p'rhaps may prove of service to the state, In matters of small consequence and weight; To make an act to walk the parish bounds, And see that sleepy watchmen go their rounds; Or, with a face most ludicrously stern, To moveâthe yawning house do now adjourn. Ami. But hast thou (pray excuse the thing I mention,) No small reversion, sinecure, or pension, No secret bribe to make retirement sweet?â Come, say how much might purchase thy retreat? Geo. For neither pension, sinecure, nor bribe, Am I indebted to the courtly tribe. Was it for this I brav'd the party-storm, And silenc'd the loud Demon of Reform, That fierce assail'd me with its thousand tongues, And brazen forehead, and stentorian lungs? Was it for this, I made a glorious stand, And gave corruption both my heart and hand? Ungrateful Party!âin declining age To hiss a hoary vet'ran off the stage. Ami. Mourn not, my Friend, thy public life is o'er, There's nothing left behind thee to deplore; For what is pow'r, but trouble, care, and pain? Hard to acquire, uneasy to retain. O! fly from court, to nature's rural scenes, To patient drudges leave the ways and means; There health is borne on ev'ry breeze that blows, There murm'ring streams shall lull thee to repose. Geo. What fancied scenes of happiness you trace, Strange comfort for a statesman out of place! Who, by no oaths political confin'd, Dare, (mirabile dictu!) speak his mind. Are hills, and dales, and valleys, half so gay As bright St. James's on a Levee day? What fierce extatic transports fill my soul, To hear the drivers swear, the coaches roll; The courtiers compliment, the ladies clack, The satins rustle, and the whalebones crack! What! shall a fallen Minister regale On slices of brown bread, and homebrew'd ale?â Lay his opinion open to rebuke, And please a Boorâwhen he might charm a Duke? And, O! the greatest nuisance in the land, Shall squire and vicar shake him by the hand, Or bellowing huntsman, follow'd by his pack, With hearty thump salute him on the back?â No, let me rather live to see the day, That joins me to the politics of Grey,â Adopt mad schemes by restless Tierney plann'd, Or, all unnotic'd, at a Levee stand.â Let me the words of blust'ring Fuller quote, Or to that puppy Holland give my vote To calculate the ex-officio fibs Of my old worthy friend, Sir Vicary Gibbs! Or, once for all, in winding up the sum Of evils present, past, and yet to come, O, let me be proclaim'd, by Hawkers loud, Political Jack-Pudding of the crowd. Ami. Since you're resolv'd, I have no more to say, But banish care and sorrow for a day; Some disappointment cross'd the Regent's mind, The Queen look'd grave, or Hertford prov'd unkind; But let the worst arrive; now, pray consider, You can but truckle to the highest bidder. ECLOGUE IV. CRAMBO. 'Twas in that glorious season of the year, When leaves are green, and op'ning buds appear, When tuneful songsters ply the feather'd wing, And Nature welcomes the return of Spring; 'Twas in that month, when urchins, loos'd from school, Make (fond of mischief,) many an April Fool, And to some crabbed dame, demurely cryâ âYour stocking's down, your cap is pinn'd awry!â 'Twas in that season, when the God of Day Once more resumes his renovating sway, When soft the rivers glide, the zephyrs blow, And farmers see their future harvests grow. Two prowling Bailiffs, hunting after prey, Thro' ancient Grub Street sped their cautious way, When, just at dawn, with joyful hearts they found The tuneful Crambo prostrate on the ground. That Crambo, whom, with wondrous toil and pain, Three tedious days they sought, but sought in vain; That Crambo, who, though tipsy and in tatters, Was crown'd the very prince of Odes and Satires; That Crambo, who defied a groaning pit, And still was thought a poet and a wit, And, ne'er repining at his fate severe, Was damn'd at Covent-Garden twice a-year. Now, with a piece of cord, both long and hard, The wary bailiffs bound the sleeping bard; His pockets next they rummag'd, but the duns Found nought but scraps of epigrams and puns, Flat, fulsome, panegyrics, stiff in stays, Remnants of farce, and fragments of new plays; An ode to riches, an address to dawn, With duplicates of sundry things in pawn; Proposals for a volume in the press, Letters to friends complaining of distress, Beseeching they would all with open hands come; And lott'ry puffs for Bish and Lady Branscomb. Much more they found of literary trash, But not one single halfpenny in cash. Cursing with disappointment verse and prose, The bailiffs tweak'd poor Crambo by the nose, Who starting from his trance, and mad with pain, Strove to get free, and bellow'd out amain.â âLoose me,â he cry'd, â'twas dangerous to bind A sleeping Bard; as you shall quickly find; When my Lord Ellenb'rough once knows the matter, he Declares you guilty of assault and battery. But if you let me go, (rejoin'd the wit,) You of this daring outrage I acquit; And if you'll grant your company so long, We'll seal the mutual bargain with a song.â âAgreed,â the Bailiffs cry'd, âno more our slave; Come, tune your pipes, and let us have the stave.â He rais'd his voice; and soon, a motley throng Of gaping hearers crowded to the song. Not more applause, when puppets dance on wire, Or some arch Merry-Andrew swallows fire; Not more applause, when Kemble, full of death, Stalks forth with bloody daggers in Macbeth; Not more applause, when Catalani's throat Pours forth a soft, mellifluous, pleasing note, Which seems to us the music of the spheres; Ere fill'd the air, or deafen'd human ears; Streets, lanes, and alleys heard the mingled jar, And scar'd pedestrians gap'd at Temple Bar. He sung the constitution's secret springs, And all the arts of ministers and kings; The party squabbles of the ins and outs; Blue-stocking clubs, and fashionable routs; And how, the gallant Regent to amuse, Some reg'ments play at soldiers, at reviews, Sham-fighting, and exchanging martial rubs At Wimbledon, Hyde Park, or Wormwood Scrubs. He sung in notes so musical and clear, The giant-slaying Cossack and his spear, Who (Zemlenutin surely would'nt lie!) Kill'd nine and thirty Frenchmen and the Fry!â Then, suddenly he borrow'd Croker's strain, And sung the wars of Portugal and Spain; And, next assuming all the minstrel's power, With Grenville, sung the lions in the Tower. Of Coates's fooleries his song began, Rare pastime for the ragamuffin clan! Who welcome with the crowing of a cock, This hero of the buskin and the sock.â Then rose his verse against those wicked imps, Call'd Flatterers, Spies, Court-parasites and pimps, Who plant their poison in a princely breast, And H?d?t's name was mention'd with the rest. He sung the course the foggy Adm'ral steer'd, And Yarmouth's whiskers, and Van Butchell's beard; Of pious roastings, Spanish inquisitions, Of penal codes, and Catholic petitions; Of birth-day odes by tuneful Laureats furnish'd, With all the dull encomiums newly burnish'd; Of Bond-street macaronies, City fops, Assemblies, Easter-balls, and Smithfield hops. He sung in rumbling strains, to shake the soul, The genealogy of Well'sley Pole; And, Britain's fond credulity to cram, Th' adventures of the whisker-fac'd Geramb; That dauntless chief! of whom there is a tale, He travell'd on the body of a whale, And, (or some folks miraculously feign it,) Spitted one hundred Frenchmen with his bay'net. More had he sung, and rival'd ancient fables, But Night, a sober widow clad in sables, Bade this Apollo of the tuneful throng Suspend awhile his yet unfinish'd song. ECLOGUE V. THE FIELD PREACHER. Damon. What ho! my Peter, tell me, I beseech, Your eager haste to town? Peter. My haste! to preach:â To lead my flock from error's thorny way, My silly, wandering sheep who idly stray, In spite of all I do, and all I say! No arguments of mine can rouse their fears, I preach to iron hearts, and leathern ears. Da. I've often wonder'd that thy flock had patience, To listen to such tedious, dull orations; And much, alas! their folly did I grieve, To think the stupid blockheads should believe: For, gentle Peter, I must say in sooth, Thou art not over nice about the truth; And not one swain who knows thee, will deny, That, Peter, thou canst preach,âand thou canst lie. Pet. Methinks, thou'rt strangely pert, good Master Damon, To shew such rudeness to a pious Layman! To vent thy bitter spleen, and impious wrath, Against the sober brethren of our cloth; Who, since the plotting Sidmouth lost his bill, (As much I hope such graceless Nobles will,) The Gospel are at liberty to dish up, And shake their heads at Vicar, Dean, and Bishop. Da. Unhappy sheep, ah! who shall set them free From such a shepherd, such a guide as thee? Didst thou not, cunning Varlet! when of late Thy hearers put their money in the plate, With sacrilegious hands the whole secure, And of their lawful right defraud the poor? Pet. An honest man may freely take his own; The cash was mine, by preaching fairly won: Go, ask my clerk; if he the fact deny, This tongue shall give the perjur'd rogue the lie. Da. Good words, old rev'rend sinner! for I trow Thy clerk's a sorry knave,âand so art thou. Pet. Egad! a libel, or the deuce is in't! Da. No libel, by my Fay! unless in print. Pet. Let Collyer boast his soft bewitching note, And crack-ton'd Wilks, the wonders of his throat; My breast nor rival fears, nor envy knows, I speak the truth,âand speak it through my nose. Da. Boast not thy fancied skill, thy false renown, Thou hypocrite! thou scarecrow of the town! Dunce at the best! in Chapels scarce allow'd To tease an empty, groaning, yawning crowd. Pet. Ah! little heed I what my Damon saith, He is not yet converted to the faith. Still, peradventure, though he idly mock The priest, the guide, the shepherd of the flock, A lambkin, he may turn his wand'ring feet; And with a contrite heart repentance bleat. Da. You've touched me, Peter! yes you have, I fear, I feel so strange, so comical, and queer; My pulse beats high, my blood and bowels yearn, I melt with love, with ecstacy I burn! Indulge me, Peter, in this pious qualm, And quicken my conversion with a psalm. Pet. Such soft sensations do the saints inherit, Who feel the inward workings of the spirit; O! would our Sisters Tabitha and Ruth, With all the crop-ear'd brethren of the truth, Assembled hither for their soul's diversion, Could see thy sudden, wonderful conversion. Da. O, name not Tabby! debonnaire and sleek, I tremble at the roses in her cheek! And Ruth is buxom, though devout and shy, A righteous heart, but yet a wicked eye! Pet. Now hear me, brother Damon; hear, I pr'ythee, My late conversionâand the Lord be wi' thee! Some forty years ago, or nearly that, I was a forward, pert, and graceless brat, My tongue was bold, and saucy were my looks, I lov'd my play much better than my books. On Sabbath-days, with Thomas Stokes and Green-field I pitch'd the quoit, shot sparrows in a bean-field; At playhouse riots I was quite the thing, When Ben, or Buckhorse fought, I kept the ring. My father would have given pounds by twenties, To bind me to some honest trade apprentice, To crush my vicious habits in their growth, But this I spurn'd, and answer'd with an oath; For, ere the down appear'd upon my chin, I was, though young in years, mature in sin. But fate, in spite of all my follies past, Resolv'd to turn my stubborn heart at last: Stokes was transported in his tender years, And Greenfield died with âCotton in his ears;â I just escap'd the same untimely check, And turn'd King's Evidence, to save my neck! I grew devout, apply'd myself to trade, And groan'd, and sang, and prophesy'd, and pray'd, Repriev'd, affronted, coax'd:âto sum up all In simple languageâI receiv'd a call. To crown the whole, I took a second wife, The Son of David lov'd the married life; Five hundred wives had he, a noble suit! And eke four hundred concubines to boot: Allowing half the story to be true, Peter might surely venture upon two! Grown old at last, unmindful of reproach, I feast, grow fat, kiss wife, and keep my coach; No care have I about my latter end, But live secure, while Satan is my friend. Da. Right deftly hast thou tun'd thy reed, my Peter, And told thy tale in mighty pleasant metre; But time is on the wing, I must be gone, What says your watch? for mine is gone to pawn. Pet. A mighty lucky thoughtâas sure as Heaven, It only wants ten minutes to eleven! Collection Sunday to begin so late! Do thou, good Damon, come and hold the plate; But first, since thus our foolish quarrel ends, Let's drink a pot of porter, and be friends. ECLOGUE VI. LORD MAYOR'S DAY. ?Quod optanti divÃ»m promittere nemo Auderet, volvenda dies, en, attulit ultro. VIRG. EN. Scarce had Aurora chas'd the shades of night, And ting'd the mountains with returning light, Blythe Chanticleer proclaim'd the rising morn, And woodlands echo'd to the winding horn; Scarce had the dextrous housemaid twirl'd her mop, Or slip-shod 'prentice swept his master's shop; Or nymphs and shepherds left their dark retreats To scream their various cries thro' London streets; When lo! a City dame, Belinda hight, Whom pleasing thoughts kept wakeful half the night, Rose from her downy pillow, blythe and gay, With anxious heart, impatient for the day. Already was the toilet's task begun, And eagerly she watch'd the ling'ring sun. For now the time had come, so long desir'd, When fair Belinda, gorgeously attir'd, In ostrich feather, wig, and diamond brooch, Should take her station in the City Coach; For Goddess Chance, to make the people stare, Had pitch'd upon her husband for a May'r. In ancient times, when Britain's laurels grew, The rival City had her Poet too; Then Laureat Settle, in harmonious lays, Immortaliz'd her feasts and public days; Her grand parades majestic roll'd along, Supreme in ode, and mock-heroic song; And while King Charles's praise was Dryden's care, He found as many virtues in the May'r. But times are chang'd; and many a tuneful strain The civic bounty courts, but courts in vainâ E'en Virgil, who in British cap and gown, Now humbly asks the favour of the town, Shall find, perhaps, no market for his rhymes, That pleas'd MÃ¦cenas, in Augustan times; And, forc'd by Dulness to his native home, Without a patron travel back to Rome. Now walk'd Belinda forth, superbly sheen, âShe look'd a goddess, and she mov'd a queen!â To make her blooming, Art its colours lent, And nought she lack'd that Fashion could invent. Rare articles for show, and few for use, Hat Ã -la-mode, and mantle Ã -la-russe; Scarfs, furbelows, for routs and public days, Racamian ringlets, and Parisian stays: Ere yet, in gaudy pride, she join'd the Show, While loudly rang the merry bells of Bow, And eager crowds in gath'ring numbers press'd, To Betty thus her feelings she express'd: Aid me, Apollo, while I touch the string! For what Belinda saidâthe Muse shall sing. âLet noble dames our pageants hold in sport, And boast the soft refinements of a court, Look down with pity on the sons of earth, Who claim no title to superior birth; Be theirs the joys of fashionable strife, Be mine the pleasures of a City life! What pleasing visions swim before my sight, By day the dinner, and the dance by night! A thousand glitt'ring tapers gild the Hall, And lo! a young Adonis, straight and tall, Perchance just landed from some foreign tour, Asks me to dance a minuet-de-la-cour. Methinks I hear th' admiring gazers cry, âSome Goddess has descended from on high, To raise our wonder, and to charm our sight, For sure no mortal ever stepp'd so light!ââ Then how 'twill give my enemies the vapours, To see it mention'd in the public papers:â ââLast night my Lady danc'd with such an air, Terpsichore had blush'd had she been there; Her eyes discharg'd so many killing darts, That half the common council lost their hearts!ââ A crown, or ten-and-sixpence at the most, Will get a puff inserted in the Post. âIt was my passion, I remember well, My early pride and glory, to excel; For when at school,âthe governess confess'd I sung, danc'd, play'd, far better than the rest. In riper years I still retain'd my pride, When rival Lovers woo'd me for their bride.â My Father would have chosen for his heir, A Buck of Fashion from St. James's Square; But I, although no conjurer, could see He lov'd himself too well, to die for me. The Country Squire's politeness knew no bounds, He swore he lov'd me better than his hounds, Spoke his regard with emphasis and force, And bid me dread no rivalâbut his Horse.â The spruce Attorney, apeing Cupid's brogue, Could hardly, in the lover, sink the rogue; But he, too eager, overplay'd his cards, I trick'd himâwith a Captain in the Guards, Whose pockets, while they strove my heart to win, Had too much gold outside, t' have much within! âHow sweet to hear, when, as the barge we board, The folks exclaim,ââMy Lady! and my Lord!ââ They shout!âand gladly welcome our approach! And see! they drag the horses from our coach! For free-born Britons love these low pursuits, To show how well they imitate the brutes. âAnd, should the Regent in his grace (God bless him!) When next the Court of Aldermen address him, Think fit, (the thought transports me with delight!) To dub my Spouse, by making him a Knight; How will the glorious news, the tidings rare, Make all our wond'ring City neighbours stare! What busy scandal will their tongues employ, They'll almost die with envyâI with joy! âBut hark! the trumpets and the horns below!â The carriage waits!âI'm summon'd to the Show!â O patience! what a flurry I am in!â Here, Betty, put this patch upon my chin!â A glass of water! I shall surely faint!â Run, Betty!âyou had nigh forgot the paint!â My case is trying, and my nerves are weak; Oh, shocking! here's a pimple on my cheek! This sudden greatness overcomes me quite, Heav'n keep me in my proper wits to-night!â ECLOGUE VII. THE TRIAL. Cives. Stop, Curio, what disaster prompts thy flight? No storm is nigh, no bailiff is in sight! Not Buonaparte flies faster when he wheels, With twenty thousand Cossacks at his heels! What, has thy wife (I tremble to inquire) Once more elop'd, and set thy house on fire? Curio. I have no time for parley,âonce for allâ I go to hear a trial at Guildhall: A case of libel, but I really doubt, If Garrow's quibbling tongue can make it out: Defendant's counsel promises the court Much private information, deal of sport; Come, let your bus'ness prove to-morrow's care, Why all the world will be assembled there; Great Garble threatens, for he owes a grudge,â Civ. Hush! recollect that Garble is a judge! More potent than a bashaw with three tails, So have a care of penalties and jails; His quick resentment reason never stems, He bullies first;â(but mum,â) and then condemns. Cur. 'Tis hard that vice should lord itâ Civ. Hard indeed! I like your errand, and commend your speed.â Cur. Then come, and bear me company;â Civ. Agreed. They reach'd the Hall, where, in familiar chat And confab close, a tribe of lawyers sat. There Garrow spouted with undaunted face, And grave Sir Thomas Plomer put his case; There Topping told the causes he had won, And Best was all antithesis and pun; There Clifford (who, through Covent Garden porch From last night's revel sail'd behind a torch,) Bawl'd rudely, as when reeling through the town, He bilks a fare, or knocks a watchman down, Or pleads, as he is wont, for half-a-crown! When lo! (a signal that the time was come,) My Lord Chief Justice Garble gave a hum! His gown he folded with repeated twirls; And shook like Jove his long ambrosial curls: Prevailing Dulness in his features dawn'd, And thrice he bit his thumbs, and thrice he yawn'd! When, after num'rous shrugs, and inward throes, Great Garble's pupil, Serjeant Splitbrain, rose! Renown'd for gross vulgarity of speech, And legal impudence that few could reach: Such was the quibbling lawyer, such the man Who, hemming thrice,âlook'd bigâand thus began. Splitbrain. My Lord, and Jurors, in this land of freedom, With honest laws and lawyers, when we need'em; This case must make all loyal subjects wince Who hate a libel, and who love their Prince. What's Satire?âWhy the very worst of crimes, A drawback on the vices of the times; A glass that brings the villain forth to view, And leaves our friends, the Clergy, nought to do! Who, though, poor souls! they lecture night and day, Can hardly keep old Lucifer at bay. Suppose a Peer of fashionable life, In some odd whim seduce his neighbour's wife, His youth or noble blood must plead his cause, And shield him from the vengeance of the laws! Nay, grant him crippled, old, with rev'rend hairs, Pray might not passion seize him unawares? If he betray'd his friend, what can be said for't? He must not be condemn'd to lose his Head For't: All men have had their frailties since the flood, And, âHomo sum,â my Lordâwe're flesh and blood! The Satirist I deem a canting rogue Who darts his quill at any vice in vogue: His wit is dull, his morals out of date, If aim'd against the follies of the great. But grant that Vice, for decency at least, Requires some gentle chiding from the priest, There's Parson DââAt Homeâ in time of need, With his well-bred accommodating creed, To put Court folly instantly to flight In language most respectful and polite. Not wishing now to state the case at large, I leave it to his Lordship in the charge; Your Verdict must find guilty the Defendant, And pack him off to Jailâso there's an end on't. Verax. On upright British Jurors, British Laws, I boldly rest the merits of my cause.â Too long has vice been sanction'd by the great, And sapp'd the strong foundations of the state; Too long have subtle pimps and flatt'rersâ Garble. Hold!â This mode of pleading, Sir! must be controll'd: This strange recrimination sets aloof All due decorum:â Ver. But, my Lord, I've proof, Plain downright proof, I hold it in my hand;â Why ev'ry honest Jury in the land Know H?d?t, H?t?d (barring all lampoons), To be sad gamesters, flatt'rers, and buffoons. This never can be libellous I trust, When all the world allows it to be just. Gar. Yes, grossly libellous, you know it well, And Scandalum magnatumâfalse as Hell!â Your client is an universal pest, The rogue has libell'd Me among the rest; He says I'm hot, and irritated soon,â Yesâwhen some blockhead puts me out of tune! That rage for ever flushes in my cheek: The villain fibs!âno barrister so meek. That guttling Epicurus in his stye, Ne'er gormandiz'd more greedily than I, Which (curse his base assurance!) is a lie. A twelvemonth spent in Newgate, dark and still, Will cure his scribbling veinâor nothing will. Ver. The man is studious, well-inform'd, though young, No Harpy's smile has he, no flatt'rer's tongue; Untutor'd in the manners of a Court, He cannot yet hold decency in sport. To vice he's neither bending nor polite, But drags the grey impostor forth to sight, Whate'er his rank or station, high or low; He courts no titled friend, he dreads no foe. Split. Henceforth no sprightly Peer can drink and wench, No Justice fall asleep upon the bench, No Col'nel pimp, no Priest disgrace his gown, But he shall be placarded through the town! E'en you, my Lord, so eloquent and grave, May chance to grow immortal in a stave, While ev'ry minstrel of the Grub Street Choir Unaw'd, unshackled, can command the lyre. Gar. As Brother Splitbrain arguesâblack is whiteâ And Truth's a lie, and wrong (in Law!) is right. May this bold-fronted libeller of Kings, Who talks of worth, and such discarded things; This Fanatic, of principles so nice! Be taught to know the dignity of vice, When veil'd beneath the splendor of a crown, A Lordling's ermine, or a Statesman's gown. Come, Jurymen, dispatchânay, prithee, pox, Don't sit a twelvemonth quibbling in the Box! I'm (Deuce confound your stupid souls, in Styx!) Engag'd to dine at Carlton House at six. ECLOGUE VIII. THE PARTING. â?Multi Committunt eadem diverso crimina fato; Ille crucem pretium sceleris tulit, hic diadema.â JUV. Close in those walls, which Frank's mistaken zeal, To please a rabble, christen'd the Bastile, Whose lofty turrets overlook the plains, Where laughter-loving nymphs and jocund swains In motley numbers, once a year repair To hold the ancient rites of Gooseb'ry Fair! Close in those walls, which ne'er a rival knew Till Peter's noisy Rostrum rose to view, (For Peter, to give Lucifer a rub, The Sons of Bridewell lectures from his tub): Two faithful Lovers to a cell retir'd, Both young alike, and by the Muse inspir'd; The red-hair'd Thyrsis, and the downcast Ruth, To whisper vows of constancy and truth: For now the Transport was equipp'd to sail, And only waited for a prosp'rous gale, To bear young Thyrsis from his Ruth away, On a septennial trip to Bot'ny Bay: And thus the couple, full of am'rous pains, Rehears'd their sorrows in alternate strains. Ruth. Since cruel fate ordains that we should part, Oh! Thyrsis, hear the feelings of my heartâ May I become as odious in thy sight As painted Hags at Drawing-rooms by nightâ Such, and so monstrous, let thy Ruth appear, If e'er her conduct give thee cause for fear. Hence with thy doubts, for shame! for surely she Deserves reproach from none,âbut least from thee. Thyrsis. Unhappy is the lesser villain's doom, Cut off in fortune's pride, in manhood's bloom! The crafty statesman, favour'd by his King, Obtains a ribbonâbut deserves a string; And, thinking it the duty of his station To cheat the public, and to starve the nation, Leaves Bridewell, Bot'ny Bay, and Tyburn tree, To friendless unprotected rogues like me! Ruth. I busy was with reading Little's muse, When Cousin Bridget brought the dreadful news: âA pretty joke (she cry'd), your Sweetheart Thyrsis, Who left an honest trade to scribble verses,â (And looking fiercely with her arms a-kimbo,) âHas (thank his roguery for it!) got in limbo.â The words she utter'd fill'd me with despair, I beat my bosom, and I tore my hair, My face I scarify'dâbehold the scars! And wept aloud, and curs'd my evil stars: My mother thought me in hysteric fits, The Doctor said that I had lost my wits; And cry'd (while to his mouth he did present his Long amber-headed cane) âNon compos mentis.â Thyr. But I must travel far, to climes unknown, Beneath the scorching or the freezing Zone; Condemn'd, alas! by Law's unjust decree, My home, my friends, my love! no more to see:â We all must reap the harvest that we sow, Good Heav'n! what ills from deeds dishonest flow. Ruth. Now hear me, Thyrsis, hear the vow I make, To die a faithful virgin for thy sake. Let eager suitors proffer bars of gold, And court me like Penelope of old, I'll show the rogues, the lady of Ulysses Had not a heart more true to love, than this is. Thyr. I know thee, Love! thou surely wert the son Of some hard judge, or shoulder-tapping dun, The ruthless pupil of Old Bailey Juries, Nurs'd by the fiends, and suckled by the furies. Ruth. O, dread not storms! my sighs shall waft thee o'erâ Though tempests should arise, and billows roar, Thy bark shall lightly skim the wat'ry realm; The God of Love, presiding at the helm, Shall night and day his watchful vigils keep, And be thy trusty pilot o'er the deep. Thyr. As to the City 'Prentice, whey and curds, So to me, gentle maiden! are thy words. As to the longing school-boy, Christmas cheer; To cattle, pastures green and rivers clear; To rosy vicars, revelry and ease; To hungry lawyers, briefs and double fees; To sick enamorato, Lady's glove;â So are thy sweet assurances of love To this fond heart, which, may I now be curst, Is not at thought of parting like to burst. Ruth. This night, my Thyrsis, let us banish care, Cutlets and bottled ale shall be our fare; Thy head shall find a pillow on my breast, My voice shall hush thy sorrows all to rest: For hark! the gaoler shakes his bunch of keys, And ev'ning Zephyrs die along the trees.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IMITATIONS OF HORACE. ODE XV. BOOK IV. TO THE PRINCE REGENT. âPhÅbus volentem prÃ¦lia loqui.â With martial heat I seiz'd the Lyre, To sing of wars and conflicts dire, And valiant heroes slain; When PhÅbus whisper'd with a frownâ âO ne'er, to please a foolish town, Attempt the battle-strain. âTo fill the soul with fond alarms, To sing the pow'r of beauty's charms, The joys of love and wine, Shall better far thy muse become, Than trumpet, pistol, sword, and drum; For not a strain can Croker thrum, To match one Ode of thine. âLet other bards, in martial verse The deeds of Wellington rehearse:â In numbers light and gay Do thou, my friend, Horatius Flaccus, Record the victories of Bacchus, A chief, who if he once attack us, Is sure to win the day. âThy Prince demands his meed of praise, Attendâand thou shalt gain the Bays, (The hungry Poet's pray'r,) For which harmonious Cibber burn'd, Which haughty Gray indignant spurn'd, And Dryden blush'd to wear.â Obedient then, I strike the Lyreâ Come, Busby, and my song inspire, And all ye rhyming host! Come, chaste Matilda! thou whose muse, In any sudden dearth of news, Adorns the Morning Post. I never swept the tuneful string To laud the virtues of a King, Or what is moreâcreate 'em: With lighter strains my friends I treat, A pun, a tale, a quaint conceit, Or Scandalum Magnatum. Then, please your Highness, tell my muse What sort of character you choose, Wise, tender, or heroic? A chief, invincible in armsâ A lover, fond of beauty's charmsâ A statesman, or a stoic? To do what many bards have done, Suppose I blend them all in one! With compliments in plenty; And paint you am'rous, wise, and brave, Chaste, philosophical, and grave, And call you one-and-twenty. Hail, mighty Prince! illustrious youth! O listen to the voice of truth, A voice to Monarchs strange; Your bright example mends the taste, Bear witness, many a slender waist From Charing Cross to 'Change! Augustan days are come, we hope, For Doctor Busby rivals Pope, And Milton keeps the rear; Sir Richard lives in Cottle's strains, And Spenser's Muse, where fancy reigns, Is distanc'd by a Peer. See Arnold, with his Pye, agree, And Skeffington, (immortal three!) The Drama's rights to seize; See Op'ras, Farces, all the rage, And Kemble banish'd from the Stage, For how can genius charm an age, Which Shakespeare fails to please? Britannia! bless thy lucky star, That gives thee Clifford for the Bar, Sly Lancaster to teach, And âAll the Talents,â All! to fool, Dance, drink, gameâany thingâbut rule! And Huntingdon to preach. My mind, as in a glass, surveys The glories of your future days, To me, my Prince! display'd; Ye years, your happy circles run! Enoughâthe promis'd task is done, And PhÅbus is obey'd. ODE XIX. BOOK II. TO DOCTOR BUSBY. âBacchum in remotis carmina rupibus.â I saw (nor disbelieve my strain,) High, in a Box at Drury Lane, In consequential trim, A little pert translating Prig, Extend his hands, and shake his wig, Most ludicrously grim. With gestures strange, and accent loud, He lectur'd to the gaping crowd, About the Drama's laws; While now and then, in noisy fit, Some long-ear'd brethren in the Pit, Who thought the Doctor still a wit, Stood up, and bray'd applause. In vain he spokeâthe Gallery Gods, From their celestial high abodes, Sent forth a dismal yell; Nor louder scream, nor hoarser cough, Were heard, when Pluto gallop'd off With Proserpine to hell. I hear, in varied cadence still, The frequent hiss, the whistle shrill, The loud discordant bray; I see the spouting Pedant stand Unmov'd,âhis Prologue in his hand, Amid the wild affray. Hail, Busby, hail! eccentric Wight! The feats of that tumultuous night Unfading laurels yield; When boldly thou withstood'st the brunt, A coat of mail, thy brazen front, And impudence thy shield. Lucretius calls thee from the shades, In hollow voice he thus upbraidsâ âFor vanity, or bribe, How durst thou murder my sublime, Thou wicked son of prose and rhyme! And bid the town subscribe? âThink'st thou my philosophic Muse, To teach the lessons of the stews Was e'er design'd by fate, To charm the ears of modern jilts, Or, Caitiff! plac'd by thee on stilts To strut in empty state? âBy nature form'd for low debate, To rhyme, to fiddle, and to prate, Impertinence thy crest; O! surely thou wert born to shine A Petit-maÃ®tre of the Nine, Apollo's scorn and jest. âSince 'twas ordain'd by angry fate That, Dunce! thou should'st my works translate, (With common sense at strife:) What now remains to blast my fame, And brand with infamy my name, But Bowles to write my Life? âIf thou would'st wound me deeper still, Let Thomas Tegg, with desp'rate quill, Arch rogue! supply the notes; And Master George, thy hopeful son, The flatt'rer play, as thou hast done, And dedicate to Coates.â ODE XIV. BOOK III. ON THE RETURN OF THE PRINCE REGENT TO BRIGHTON. âHerculis ritu modo dictus, Ã´ plebs.â Hark! the merry bugles sound Ev'ry heart to lighten; Beat the drums, His Highness comes, The Prince returns to Brighton! Now for FÃªtes and Routs a score, Prom'nades, Balls, Outridings; Bloomfield in a chaise and four, Proclaims the joyful tidings. Crowds of gazers walk the Steyne, Prim Mammas and Misses; Such were seen, when Greece again Beheld her lost Ulysses: Doctor T? a motion makesâ Let ev'ry beau and belle come, And join his pranks, a vote of thanks To bid His Highness welcome! Pierce a cask of gen'rous wine, Claret, Port, or Sherry; Drink his health in bumpers nine, 'Fore George, we will be merry! Bacchus gay shall rule the day, Unless our rev'rend Vicar, A rosy Put, has pierc'd the butt, And drank up all the liquor. Call Fitzherbert, ancient fair! From her Cytherean border, Bid the Sybil bind her hair, And put her charms in order: Jersey to the feast invite, For such a painted beldam At fifty-six, on this side Styx, We surely see but seldom. Margate, boast thy lofty pier, Thy cliff, and castle, Dover; Bath, thy fashionable cheer, And many a Bond-Street rover! Brighton, highly-favour'd spot! Shall still outshine the million; Happy since she boasts a Prince, To grace her long pavilion. Arthur, valor's fav'rite son, Bold, intrepid, brave, he Cudgels Frenchmen till they run, And makes them cry âpeccavi!â Col'nel Bloomfield, stout and tall, (Was e'er a hero prouder?) Though his head escape the ball, It does not miss the powder. May old age, a tyrant fell! That fills the bones with dryness, Vanquish'd by some magic spell, Politely pass your Highness. Long may Britain own your sway; While we, of merry sort all, Shall wish our Prince as Horace gay, And, like his strains, immortal. EPODE II. IN PRAISE OF A COUNTRY LIFE. âBeatus ille qui procul negotiis.â Happy he, who free from care Breathes the sweets of country air, Far from town, where traffic drives, Noisy brats, and scolding wives. Anxious thoughts, and worldly schemes Ne'er disturb his pleasing dreams; War for him has no alarms, When ambition calls to arms. Honest, he abjures the Law; Splendid Courts he never saw; Courts, where Placemen, night and day, Flatter first, and then betray. If, to cheat the ling'ring time, Goddess Mirth provoke a rhyme, Full of wit it smoothly runs, Quaint conceits, and merry puns. Formal pedants, bred at schools, Boast of Aristotle's rules; Such, let cringing bards obey, Servile wits, who write for pay. Nought restrains his Muse of whim, Critics dull may rail for him; Still he rhymes, and writes it down, Let them smile, or let them frown. If the bounteous Gods afford Some kind wife to spread his board, See him blest with, day and night, Converse sweet and chaste delight. Would you once his mind bewitchâ Give him wealth, and make him rich: Keep him to his low degree, Kings are not so blest as he. ODE XX. BOOK I. A POET'S INVITATION. âVile potabis modicis Sabinum.â If you come to dine with me, Dainties must not be your care; Harmless pleasure, social glee, And the Poet's frugal fare; These I giveâand should my Lord Me to visit humbly deign, Port is all I can afford, He must bring the bright Champaigne! Cool beneath a spreading vine, Jovial Horace, thirsty chap, he Quaff'd his rich Falernian wine, With MÃ¦cenus snug and happyâ We, in lodgings near the skies, Of Apollo humbler scions, Banquet amidst London Cries, And the bray of Kent-Street Lions. ODE XV. BOOK III. TO A FADED BEAUTY. âUxor pauperis Ibyci.â Dear Chloris, at an age like thine To dance, coquet, and dress so fine, And ape such youthful airs, Might shock a taste not over nice, So prithee take a friend's advice, Repent, and say thy pray'rs. Give o'er thy light fantastic tricks, For coquetry at fifty-six, Credulity disarms! Forswear the company of beaux, Nor thus to ridicule expose The winter of thy charms. No beauty thou hast left to boast, Though twenty years a reigning toast, By coxcombs pledg'd aloud; Retreat in time, give others room, No nostrum can restore thy bloom; Haste, Chloris! nor defraud the tomb, Death courts thee for a shroud. What sprightly PhÅbe, frank and free, So well becomes, sits ill on thee, Thou folly's doting tool; Leave off thy pert affected prate, Thy childish lisp, thy mincing gait, And blush that vanity, so late, Should make thee play the fool. Ah! roll no more the leering eye At ev'ry fop that flutters by, Thy ogling days are past: And mark the moral of my strain, That beauty, though she proudly reign, Must be dethron'd at last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE TIMES; OR, THE PROPHECY. ? âNunquam libertas gratior exstat Quam sub Rege pio.â? FIRST PRINTED IN THE YEAR 1811. FOURTH EDITION. THE TIMES. Bold is the man who, with satiric rage, Aims to reform a weak and vicious age; Who, flush'd with honest anger, dare complain, And shew he holds its vices in disdain: For when corruption bears unbridled sway, When tyrants rule, and willing slaves obey, Some hireling, black apostate, lost to shame, Will swear reproof and libel are the same; And gravely preach, with other wondrous things, That sin is no disgrace in Lords and Kings. Hail useful Satire! whose inspiring strain Shall lash the world, when parsons preach in vain! When justice sleeps, and sets the villain free, Expiring Virtue calls for aid to thee! Yet say what crimes, in this regen'rate age, Demand thy censure and provoke thy rage, What need of Satire to reform the times, So great our virtues, and so small our crimes? What contemplative mind but now deplores Once favor'd Israel's desolated shores? Sees Rome's proud empire to destruction hurl'd, The seat of arts, the mistress of the world, Where god-like wisdom flow'd from Cato's tongue, Where CÃ¦sar triumph'd, and where Virgil sung? What mind so uninform'd that need be told How great, how blest was Babylon of old? What now remains to meet the curious eye? Her massy domes in scatter'd fragments lie; In vain the traveller would seek to trace The artist's breathing form, the sculptor's grace, The spoiler's hand hath marr'd the beauties there, Which only faintly tell what once they were. Did guilt bring wrath on Israel's chosen race, What claim have we on Heav'n's redeeming grace? Did Jewish priests blaspheme the Saviour's name? Hear our blasphemers too! and blush for shame. Did justice cry aloud, unknown, unheardâ See worth untimely crush'd, and vice preferr'dâ Did sin bring Israel's glory to the tombâ Hear Britain, hear, and tremble for thy doom! Long hath th' Eternal blest thy favor'd land, And pour'd down mercies with a lib'ral hand; Still art thou spar'd, so fallen and deprav'd, To seek his grace, and if thou wilt, be sav'd! Grac'd as thou art with Learning's ample store, And justly proud of Greek and Roman lore, Tho' crown'd with science bright, that lifts her eye To view the various wonders of the sky, Thy glories are eclips'd, or vainly shine, If truth forsake thee with her light divine. Reflect, if still in wilful error blind, And let the thought sink deep within thy mind, Thy stubborn pride contemn the warning voice, And bid thee vaunt and glory in thy choice; How doubly lost thy nation shall remain, Blest with the gospel's sound, but blest in vainâ Perhaps e'en now, to consummate thy woe, Heav'n meditates the long-suspended blow, To bury all thy triumphs in the dust, For God, tho' merciful, will still be just. Spain! thou hast felt the truth of this decreeâ Now hath the sword of terror wasted thee; That desolating sword thy sons of yore, To Indian plains in savage triumph bore! Long hath th' eternal arm withheld the blow, Yet Heav'n, tho' late, hath lain thine honours low; While Vengeance, prompt at retribution's call, Laughs at thy shame, and glories in thy fall. Well pleas'd we view what providence ordains, And grateful own the God of justice reigns! He saw thee act the robber's, murd'rer's part, He mark'd the bitter tear, the broken heart, And but delay'd the terrors of his pow'r, To crush thee in his own appointed hour. See, from thy plains what mingled horrors rise! Hark! 'twas a dying groan that pierc'd the skies! In towns laid waste, in villages that burn, We see thee ravag'd and destroy'd in turn! How shall we stand acquitted? Bow thy knee, Imperial Britain, bow, and urge thy pleaâ Plead for thy favor'd Isle; where full-blown pride Thrusts unpretending honesty aside; Where venal poets prostitute the muse, And slumb'ring prelates preach to empty pews; Where Truth shall dread if once she ope her lips, Fines, law-suits, jeers, imprisonment, and whips; Where Justice tries to lift her voice on high, While Law, alarm'd, preserves a jealous eye; Where ribald sceptics, fav'rites of the town, Who boast their philosophical renown, Make that blest name which dying martyrs sung, The scoff of ev'ry idle babbler's tongueâ If thou wouldst stand acquitted, this thy pleaâ Bid Justice quit her throne, and bow to thee! Is there a villain that pollutes thy shore, And turns a parson to blaspheme the more; In folly, guilt, and ignorance supine, Defying laws both human and divine, Who boldly stands th' expositor of truth, The downright juggler of a Smithfield booth, And preaches temp'rance, while his greedy soul Dwells on the social pleasures of the bowlâ Him (tho' the law no punishment ordain For those who take their Maker's name in vain, Assume the prophet's mission, hold the rod, And call their blasphemy, the word of God,) Shall useful Satire reach, and strike with awe, And those shall feel its force, who laugh at law. What's Virtue?âbut a mask to cheat the blind! An empty name, a phantom of the mind, A tale the sophist tells, the fool believes, An artful plea that damns, while it deceivesâ But faith, that precious opiate of the soul! Lulls all our fears to rest, and makes us whole, Gives colour to the vices of the times, Sets conscience free, and sanctifies our crimes! Blest argument that proves, AvarÃ² cries, My undisputed title to the skies! I, who have set my heart against despair, Whose care of self, drowns ev'ry other care; Who ne'er till earth shall take these old remains, Will give the world one farthing of my gains; I, who would triumph in my country's fall, Did not her sinking funds possess my all; I, who remain in these degen'rate days, A bitter foe to poetry and plays, Kneel at God's sacred altar, with my crone; And hate all sects and customs but our own, Shall, when this sinful world is wrapp'd in flame, Exult in faith's reward, and virtue's shame! Strange doctrine! let the promis'd bliss be thineâ May virtue's hopes, and virtue's fate be mine! When the last day exulting seraphs hail, And Heav'n's bright throne appears without a veil, Then shall our sev'ral claims be justly try'd By Him, who, to confirm them, groan'd, and died. For virtue who shall plead? What Heav'n holds dear, Names of high worth, tho' little valued here. Patience, on whom life's ills innocuous fall, And gentle charity that feels for all; Nor least, the widow's and the orphan's pray'r, Shall reach the throne, and find acceptance there. These are thy bright rewards, O truth divine! These shall, ere long, O Wilberforce, be thine! Such bliss awaits the man who pitying gave Light to the blind, and freedom to the slave! And taught his ruthless ministers of woe, Mercy's blest name, and friendship's sacred glow! Afric, rejoice! from Britain's distant shore, Your grateful sons the welcome tidings bore; Britain, who scorns, in amity sincere, To rob you of the gem she holds so dear, Hath sent fair Liberty beyond the main, To consecrate your land, and burst your chain! O could she her immortal truths disclose, And plant in desarts wild, sweet Sharon's rose; Then should her labours prosper in their aim, And blend with Freedom's, Faith's serener flame, Teach your believing sons on Him to call, Who shed his precious blood to ransom all. Is there a deed that Heav'n itself approves, That god-like virtue prompts, compassion moves, That gives the human soul new light to shine, And proves indeed its origin divine, 'Tis that, which sends to earth's remotest bound, Salvation's work, the Gospel's cheering sound! Go ye, who shall the proud distinction claim, And teach the nations your Redeemer's name! Go, plant his glorious cross in wilds unknown, And bring new subjects to Jehovah's throne! Say, when astonish'd nature saw him die, Red light'ning flash'd, and thunder shook the sky, And while the rocking earth beheld his pain, The Temple's awful veil was rent in twain! Go to the wretched couch where mis'ry lies, Exalt the soul, and point her to the skies! If doubt or fear invade the dying bed, Tell how your Saviour suffer'd, how he bled, Burst hell's strong fetters, triumph'd o'er the grave, And lives to bless the saints he died to save. Here pause the sorrowing Muse with sacred dread, To pay her honours to th' illustrious dead, Recall those names Britannia's sons adore, And tell of worth and greatness now no moreâ How Pitt, and O! that name for ever dear, Lives in my heart, and vibrates in my ear,â With gen'rous ardor rais'd his country's fame, And gave new lustre to the patriot's name! Who, when the civil storm began to low'r, And factious knaves call'd loud for place and pow'r, Stood forth fair Freedom's champion, nobly great, To save from tyrant hands a sinking state! Who died unpension'd, crown'd with just applause, A faithful servant in the public cause!â Be envy silent o'er his hallow'd dust, And, if it dare not imitate, be just. Again, are Britain's hopes involv'd in gloom, Again she mourns a Patriot's early tombâ Firm in his country's cause the statesman rose, In spite of foreign and domestic foes; Admiring senates heard with awe profound, Pale treason stood aghast, and faction frown'd! While those to whom his mem'ry still is dear, With whom the Muse shall drop the sacred tear, Whom party ne'er could move, nor envy blind, Rever'd the brighter beauties of his mind. Did mis'ry e'er to Perceval complain, Did mercy sue? they never sued in vain: His ear was open to affliction's call, His hand to virtuous want, his heart to all. Stars, garters, ribands, all are glitt'ring toys! And long-drawn titles make a mighty noise! Titles, to low-born minds distinctions rare, May make the flatt'rer cringe, the vulgar stare; But to the man who strikes at honest fame, They brand with new disgrace a worthless name. Lothario is a proud Patricianâmark! A Liberal, too! a traitor in the dark, A vile, intriguing slave, whose treach'rous mind, Nor honour's sense could move, nor friendship bind. Peace to Lothario's breast! if peace can reign, Where passion rules, and virtue pleads in vain: Joy to Lothario's heart! if joy can e'er From guilt repel the terrors of despair. Yet hadst thou not aspir'd to pow'r and fame, Thy worthless deeds had perish'd with thy name; But when thou wouldst assume the patriot's part, A mountebank in morals as thou art! 'Tis fit the muse, as dreading virtue's frown, Should tell the world thy name, and pluck thee down. Sir Sycophant, for splendour and support, Bows, cringes, scrapes, and flourishes at Court, Flies to the levee of some titled knave, Proud to become his lordship's humble slave. Admitted once with courtly peers to sit, He pimps, buffoons, drinks hard, and turns a wit, Laughs at his patron's jestsâa ready tool, To draw a cork, say grace, and play the fool! Vers'd in' the paltry art of low grimace, In Britain's senate, see, he takes his place, Applauds the minister in Stentor's note, And sells at once his country and his vote. The point obtain'd, the dirty bus'ness done, Corruption hails him as her darling son; Whispers his merit in his Sov'reign's ear, And dubs him placeman, pensioner, and peer. He robs the nation with rapacious handsâ His grandeur asks for equipage and lands! Gold he must have, no matter from what source, While mountebanks and fiddlers come of course! And what this minion does, because he's great, Would hang a hundred rogues of mean estate. You'll surely grant one statesman may be found With truth and honesty, on English ground, To whom fair fame her blooming chaplet givesâ I grant there may be one, while Eldon lives.â Or Erskineâand I triumph in the name, The first and fairest on the rolls of fame; Whose mind embraces all the wise can teach, And all that soft humanity can reachâ These are the men (not ev'ry booby lord Who drives his prancing bloods, and smacks his cord!) To guard the senate with a watchful eye, Unmask her foes, and bid sedition die. O! when I see how men of little fame, Men who are only popular in shame, Cajole a hungry factionâsmirk and bow, And pluck the honours from a nobler brow; I snatch the lyre, and sweep the chords along, Pour a rough strain, nor heed the grace of song! Who would not laugh, to see a solemn fool, Like Midas, perch'd upon the judgment stool? Behold this modern Jeff'ries of the bench, Abuse a vagrant, chuckle with a wench; Brow-beat a jury, urge the culprit's fate, And rather hang too soon, than dine too late! Mark him in privateâunconcern'd and freeâ No village clown a verier sot than he! He smokes his pipe, tells tales, and stirs the fire, Laughs with the priest, and tipples with the squire; Bawls out an oath, or cracks a smutty jest, Pays for the worst, but always drinks the best; And reeling homeward, if occasion need, Gravely expounds the law he cannot read. But hushâmy Lord may frown, and take offenceâ What is my crime?âPlain truth and common sense! Is truth a crime?âyou jest!âIf you pursue This strain of censure, you may find it true! Produce an instance.âIf my counsel fail, Will you lay down five hundred for my bail?â Keep within proper bounds, or be undoneâ Vice hath no bounds, and satire should have none! What are these men, these little limbs of law, Who keep poor trembling vulgar souls in awe? These quibbling parchment brokers! who of late Have crept like worms to undermine the state? These buzzing wasps who sting us if we touch, Who do so little and who talk so much, That free-born poets should be struck with awe, And make the muses' court, a court of law? No, while I live, I'll fear no haughty judge Who hates the truth, and owes the muse a grudge, Because the muse, in some unlucky hour, Said upstart fools were often mad with pow'râ If in the cause of justice, 'tis my fate To wake the fears, or raise the villain's hate, Truth shall approve and vindicate her lays, And crown my labours with immortal praise. The purse-proud fool, of aught beneath the skies Is what I pity most, and most despise;â Wealth is indeed a blessing, when applied To nobler purposes, than thrift, or pride; A blessing, tho' to thousands the reverse, A precious gift which man has made a curse! Go search the sacred scriptures, read with care The deeds of charity recorded there,â The widow's boon a bright example see, And learn the use of good bestow'd on thee! What, tho' with bleeding heart, with anguish wild, The starving mother mourn'd her dying child, Elijah of the scanty pittance fed, And shar'd the last sad morsel of her bread. In joy's light moments, in affliction's hour, We feel one mighty all-sustaining Pow'râ Does conscious guilt distract the mind with grief? 'Tis God, that ruling Pow'r, who brings reliefâ Does pleasure charm? to his unbounded love Belong all peace below, all bliss above! Does plenty ope, for us, her golden stores, And freedom bless, and conquest crown our shores? Alive, the song of gratitude to raise, Be ours the blessing, and be his the praise! See Grotius, blest beyond a common fateâ Born to a richer, not a happier state; Enjoying all that fortune can impart, He wants no moreâexcept an easy heart. In vain he reads what soundest casuists teach, And thinks the object still within his reach; Yet finds that wealth can ne'er our ills opposeâ Once turn the scale, or lighten human woes. Old Gripus praysâand so does Gripus' wifeâ They go to church, and lead a sober life; Starch in their manners, zealous in their creed, The world accounts them pious folks indeed! Poor Gripus swears that riches are a curse; Yet all his bliss lies centred in his purse! His wife, good soul! too provident to spend, Would sooner die than waste a candle's end! If you would live his friend, and prove his heir, Be slow at works, but diligent in pray'r; Prove what the world esteems an honest man, Pray when you please, but profit when you can! Would you be blest?âthe proper means pursue; Make others happy, and be happy too. How trivial are the wants that life requires; The fault is less with fate, than our desires. Yet do we oft complain, our blindness such, That fortune gives too little, or too much; Say, why too much, if worthily employ'd? Too little, if that little be enjoy'd? For mark what ills on cumbrous grandeur wait,â What fearful visions haunt the bed of state! The wretch, before whom pamper'd menials bend, May fifty flatt'rers boast, but not one friend. Unwieldy wealth, a source of endless strife, Shuts up the soul, and binds it fast to life; Gives ten-fold terrors to the tyrant death, Haunts our last hour, and leaves but with our breath. Be grateful for the good that Heav'n bestows, By day employment, and by night repose; Content that if enough your means are found, To make the goblet with the year go round; To share with suff'ring worth your friendly store, And banish want, pale spectre, from the door. Wanders my muse from method's slavish rules. And all the solemn pedantry of schools, In sportive mood forsakes the beaten track? Method, a pedant dull, shall bring her back:â She, like the bird that airy sports engage, Flies from her narrow bounds, and leaves the cage; Fond of her freedom, prunes her ruffled wings, And wild and artless are the lays she sings. Soft is the linnet's song, the thrush's throat Warbles so sweetly clearâthe blackbird's note May charm, and Philomela's mournful strain Dissolve the pensive soul in pleasing painâ But the gay tuneful lark, that soars, and sings, Feels freedom urge her note and spread her wings; She, first to welcome morning's genial ray, Sings to the setting sun a parting lay! Horace and Pope with free familiar grace, Reprov'd our follies with a laughing face, But, throwing off the censor's aspect stern, We grew familiar too, and laugh'd in turn. In harsher strain, with more indignant fire, The stately Juvenal has swept the lyre: Yet oft he marr'd the cause he aim'd to mend, Obscene his language, tho' divine his end: Young aim'd a dart at vice, but venal praise And fulsome flatt'ry marr'd the poet's lays: Johnson, whose mighty name the wise revere, With rigid morals, amiably severe, Stood forth the champion of an injur'd cause, Gave language grace, dispens'd the critic's laws; Deep silence reign'dâthe idle, babbling crowd, Impertinent and vain, submissive bow'd; He prov'd to Vice alone, a stubborn foe, And Virtue own'd him as her friend below. Churchill, the rudest of the tuneful choir, Snatch'd from the willing Muse the ready Lyre, And struck a chord so deep, that Vice amaz'd, Recoil'd, and startled Guilt with wonder gaz'd! Cowper with noble ardour touch'd the strings, Approving Virtue listens while he sings; That mild philanthropy, those thoughts refin'd Which grac'd his deathless verse, adorn'd his mind. Religion, source of ev'ry pure desire, Glow'd in his heart, and Virtue's holy fire There found its altar; Faith's immortal flame, And gentle soothing Charity, whose name Archangels in melodious concert sungâ And Hope, in native beauty ever young, Inspir'd his Muse; and Nature's breathing sweets, Her woodbine arbours, and her green retreats, Were themes he lov'd: and Pity's gentle charm He sweetly sung; a wanton act of harm His soul abhorr'd; the wild and tim'rous hare Fled to his roof, and found a refuge there! Yet oft to harsher themes his Lyre he strung, And deep Remonstrance dwelt upon his tongue; O'er thoughtless Guilt he dropp'd the Prophet's tears, And rous'd a slumb'ring nation into fears. Say, what inducement yet was ever found For wits to venture on poetic ground? Alas! 'tis poor encouragement they meet, Their only choiceâa garret, or the Fleet! The mighty Homer was oblig'd to fast, Though luckier Pope was amply paid at lastâ The Chanc'ry thus, with true parental care, Starves the right owner to enrich the heir! Butler, with wit and humour on his side, Wrote well, nor found a patron till he died. Dryden, to whom the magic pow'r was given With harmony to raise the soul to Heav'n, Long time the servant of a worthless court, Outliv'd at last its favour and support. Steele was distress'd, while Laureat Cibber fed; Lee roam'd, a wanderer, Otway begg'd his bread; Savage, whose fame shall live to future times, Died the sad victim of a parent's crimes. Ah, what avails if all the Nine inspire, With Shakespeare's nature, and with Milton's fire, If Poverty, with all her loathed train, Usurp the spot where Taste and Genius reign? What boots it, if the soul be taught to soar From earth to heav'nâwith eager eye t' explore Things only visible where Wisdom's light Hath shone sublimeâelse veil'd from human sightâ If doom'd to feel Affliction's galling weight, The scorn of villains and the frowns of fate? Has Providence so mark'd the Poet's name With bitterness, obscurity, and shame; Op'd to his ardent view a fairy scene, To render want more irksome, grief more keen? Has Heav'n ordain'd the mind supremely blest, By godlike genius rais'd above the rest, Should perish, ere its tenement of clay Hath gone to dustâshould blaze and pass away? O 'tis a bitter truth, by none denied, A truth that well may humble learned pride, That reason, God's best gift, may feel a void, Her sacred temple shook, though not destroy'd. Such, Collins, was thy fate, nor thine aloneâ Well may those walls that echo'd to thy groan Bear witness to the tale! till taught to rise, Thy soul expanding, sought her native skies, Found in religion that assur'd relief, Strength for her faith, and solace for her grief. Thanks to the gen'rous Muse! to her I owe Much of Life's consolation here belowâ Mark'd by misfortune even from the womb, Thrice snatch'd, an early sufferer, from the tomb, Once more unwilling to the world allied, For had my fate been happier, I had died; Much have I suffer'd, much endur'd from those Whom envy, fraud, and dulness made my foes. O how can I address thee! shall I blend In thee, the kind protector, father, friend, The faithful guardian of my earliest youth, Whose deeds were virtue, and whose precepts truth? Noâcandour would blot out the treach'rous line, Thou scourge, thou bitter scourge of me and mine! Hast thou not read in God's most holy word, And tremble at the sin thou hast incurr'd, How lost is he, the basest, most accurs'd, Of all the tribe of sinners stampt the worst, Who robs the widow, or the widow's son, And eats the orphan's breadâas thou hast done? O could I burst the grave's oblivious gloom, And call thy once lov'd Brother from the tomb, If, rising from the earth, the dead should speak, How would conviction blanch thy coward cheek, Wring ev'ry nerve, and tell thy guilty heart, How foully thou hast play'd a Brother's part! For me, whate'er my fate, if good or ill, May Heav'n decree a spotless conscience still, Contentment and serenity of mind, Though prone to sadness, still to all resign'dâ Resign'dâe'en now I wipe the filial tear, For one long lost, yet still to mem'ry dear, In the blest hope I hasten to that shore Where we shall meet again, to part no more. Yes, there's a charm amid severest woe, A secret charm that only poets know, That whispers to the Bard, his suff'rings pass'd, A glorious immortality at last! Ah! who shall now resume the Censor's lyre, With honest zeal, and well-attemper'd fire; Pierce through dark error's gloom, bring Truth again, And show mankind the beauties of her reign? To curb the statesman's petulance and pride, And send him truth and wisdom for his guide; To tell some greedy pluralists, who teach, 'Twere well if priests would practise what they preach; To stop the villain in his bold career, And whisper Conscience, in the lawyer's ear; To lead the wand'rer back, who went astray, To show mankind the error of their way; And work reform among this motley crew, A modern Satirist has much to do. 'Tis well when Princes, who in earlier days Were dupes of ev'ry mean dependant's praise, And slaves to Folly, rais'd a nation's fears, Grow grave and wiser in succeeding years, And blushing for their sad misconduct past, Resume their native dignity at last! This England deeply felt in days of yore, And Heav'n perchance those days may soon restore, When the fifth Harry, peerless in renown, Did ever Prince so well deserve a crown? Gave to the world a lesson of his own, Which prov'd his noblest title to the throne. His youth was vicious, libertine, and low, His sports were vulgar, his companions soâ Revel and riot fill'd each noisy hour, And Law retain'd its name, but lost its pow'râ His sire (his tott'ring crown by murder won!) Thought Heav'n had pour'd its vengeance in his son; While Britain saw her future evils spring, And trembled at the thought of such a King. Vain fears, though justâno sooner was the crown Plac'd on his head, than, with an awful frown, He call'd the vagrant crew, and wiser grown, Reprov'd their follies much, but more his own; He bade them ev'ry former vice give o'er, Reform their lives, or see his face no more. To the wise servants of his Father's train He prov'd a friend, religion held her reign, Law kept its pace with mercy, though severe; And only coward guilt had cause for fear. O'er foreign lands he spread his matchless fame, And haughty Gallia trembled at his name; Her captive King in English fetters bound, Her pride destroy'd and humbled to the ground. Apply the taleâthere yet may come a time, (And now I only prophecy in rhyme,) When such a prince, a prince of noble fire, Shall bless our Isle, and bid the world admire: When we shall see, and call the times our own, A second Harry Monmouth mount the throne! Is there a man in England's wide domain, Whose heart would not exult at such a reign? When Liberty, which our brave Fathers steel'd, To shed their blood in many a well-fought field, When tyrant Kings, may Britain ne'er again Behold such rulers! forg'd the heavy chain To bind her fast, and had not just alarms, To Runnemede's bold barons cried, âto arms!â Her glorious name, so much rever'd of yore, Had sunk in endless night, to rise no more, When Liberty shall reign throughout the Land, And Justice re-assume her old command. Yes, if a Prince aspire to Harry's fame, (And where shall monarch find a nobler aim?) Let interest, will, and passion be subdu'd, And private friendship bow to public good. Let no Dependants crowd around his gate, Drones in the church, or Hirelings in the state; No German Counts, who fiddlers were at home, No fops from Paris, and no priests from Rome; These must no more employ his precious hours, But the lost mind, resuming all its pow'rs, With new-born vigour into life shall spring, And the gay Trifler perish in the King! Let no mean Tyrant, such as I could find, Whose features are an index to his mind, Savagely pluck sweet mercy from her throne, To gratify some vengeance of his ownâ Let no false Patriot, frantic for reform, And ripe for faction, raise the civil storm; Bid Loyalty before its altar bleed, And call it zeal, to sanctify the deedâ Let no gall'd Bishop rival Bonner's name, In England's church light up the Popish flame, And bring before her trembling sight again Those bloody scenes which curs'd a Tudor's reign, When Ridley, Latimer, immortal names! Died for their faith, triumphant 'midst the flames! Far from thy councils, Britain, may they roam, And in some foreign country find a home, Where Slaves, obedient to a Tyrant's reign, Bow their submissive necks and hug their chain. Great, truly great, shall be that Monarch's name, Who builds his glory on his people's fame; His praise shall travel to the furthest Pole, Where winds can bellow, and where waves can roll. Like Him of old, who gave Britannia laws, His glorious name crown'd with deserv'd applause, Shall brightly shine in Hist'ry's ample page, A leading star through each succeeding age! In vain shall Tyrants spread their wild alarms, The God of Battles shall defend his armsâ In vain shall Traitors, with infuriate zeal, Drug the dire bowl, or point the murd'rous steel; Heav'n shall o'ertake the wretch with wrath divine, Arrest his hand, and blast the foul design. When full of worth, and years, and fair renown, He leaves an earthly for a heav'nly crown; The Patriot's sigh shall murmur o'er his bier, And Freedom greet his mem'ry with a tear. Long shall his race, to future heroes grown, With still increasing glory fill the throne, Their honour'd names in fair succession run, The Father's virtues bright'ning in the Son. Surrounding nations shall with envy see, That to be conq'rer, Britain must be free; For when the Flag of Liberty's unfurl'd, She arms her heart with steelâand dares the world.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE CONVERSAZIONE. THE CONVERSAZIONE. The cards dispers'd, the guests invited, The curtains drawn, the candles lighted; In silver state, the port, the sherry, The strong bohea, the fragrant berry; A crowd of Literati rush, And storm the door of Mr. Brush! Say, wherefore, Muse, this outward din, This pomp and circumstance within? Lo, Brushâwho gives to City Madam As many charms, as if she had 'em; And tricks out Aldermanic phiz With sense and meaningâwhat a quiz! And makes a form, however queer, Start forth Apollo Belvidereâ Lo, Brush,âa man of paint and lettersâ In imitation of his bettersâ Brushâin th' Academy, a star, a Wit, craniologist, and R. A.â Must have his little batch of Bards To conversation, tea, and cards. Lightly tripping up the stairs, The motley party mount in pairs, Economics, from Lombard Street, And Metaphysics, from the Fleet! Whitechapel prose, and verse that smacks Of Ludgate, and St. Mary-Axe! Yon dapper coxcomb, sprucely drest, Is one, whose rhyme is in request; While he, who creeps from loftier stories, Is one, whose poetry a bore is. Yet here, like sprites, they mingle may, The wit, the dunce, the grave, the gay; The young, the old, the short, the tall; To Mr. Brush they're welcome, all. They reach the drawing-room; where, lo, Sits Mr. Brush, in statu quo, Lord of his TusculumâSoho! His wife and daughters either side, Apollo's playthings and his pride! Around, about, above, beneath, See âFriendship's Off'ring,â âWinter's Wreath,â âThe Keepsake,â âAmulet,â and âBijou,â Brimful of pretty prints to please you! Smart periodical bouquÃ¨ts, That bloom and wither while we gaze, Then sink in Dulness' lap to rest, For she takes first what she loves best! Though in the desart, drear and dry, A limpid stream conceal'd may lie, 'Tis hardly worth our while to grope Pandora's box, in search of âHope.â Now mutual compliments begin, The weekly critic cocks his chin, For as a Mag. transcends a journal, Your seven-days' scribe precedes diurnal. Where'er he rolls in awkward state, The smaller wits attendant wait, Fearing an Informatem fulmen, For critics are the dread of dull men. A virgin Muse her off'ring brings, A tender Ode in leading strings; A smile intreats, a corner begs, To set the bantling on its legs. Bowing and scraping, from his attic, With humble suit, the bard dramatic, Beseeches Aristarch to say A word in favour of his playâ For, now-a-days, a friendly puff, And Madame Vestris, half in buff, And Liston's face, are quantum suff, To make a comedy legitimate, Say Mr. Mathews and his witty mate. Woman's scorn, and manhood's shame, A nondescript, without a name, A pompous gig, it takes its round, Repulsive, leaden, and profound. With all its gravity of mien, It dearly loves a jest obscene, And if a fool profanely sin, Good Lord, how horrible its grin! Ungrateful, selfish, vainly blind, It cheats itself, and not mankind; Who pass from theory to fact, Compare its scribbling, with its act,â And find the one, as much with sense At war, as t'other with pretence. With ambiguity of speech, Arraigning truths above its reach, Propounding queries, splitting straws, Chance, fate, free-will, effect and cause; Whichever way its humour leans, The more it talks, the less it means. Sly Reynard left, by odd mishap, His tail behind him in a trap; And wishing not to look exclusive, He tried, by argument conclusive, To prove to all the Reynards round, That tails were better lost, than found! But nought his sophistry avails, They heard the wag, and wagg'd their tails! Admiring much the fashion new, Yet thought it best to keep them too! And we, who know what orthodox is, And what, without a tail, a fox is! Laugh, when the sceptic would persuade us Out of the Providence that made us. Lumb'ring, and tugging up the hill Of modern metaphysics,âMill, A heavy proser, dull and futile, he Th' eternal question puts, âQuid utile?ââ And though no sailor born or bred, Gramercy! how he heaves the lead! And then, the northern drone, M`Culloch, Whose system classes man with bullock,â That system, (Ethics thrive apace!) A bull!âperks forth his lacquer'd face. Each erring in a different school, How strange the contest, fool with fool! In science various ways they pull, Yet still, unanimously dull! Superlatively queer the cant Of long-ear'd Puritans that rant, Of owl-ey'd critics hypercritical, Of quacks, poetical, political, Of craniologists, and all From Spurzheim, down to Dr. Gall; Or deeper, ay, and deeper still, From Dr. Gall, to Dan Deville! But not, the Calvinistic cant Of long-ear'd Puritans that rant; The cant of critics hypercritical, Of quacks, poetical, political, Of craniologists, and all From Spurzheim, down to Dr. Gall; Or deeper, ay, and deeper still, From Dr. Gall, to Dan Deville!â Is half so comical, in sooth, As that queer cantâthe cant of Truth, Which dull philosophers grope out Of darkness, apathy, and doubt! Enough for me, the sacred page (My guide in youth, my hope in age,) More than Philosophy hath giv'n, Life, immortality, and heav'n! A joy that knows nor guilt, nor fear, A balm for sorrow's bitt'rest tear, A truth by Sages handed down, Who bears the cross shall win the crown. Mark yon fribbled form of fungus, How the deuce came she among us? Quite a negative, I'm told, Neither very young, nor old, Dull nor witty, hot nor cold! Wheresoe'er she turns her eyes, Cupid claps his wings, and flies; Venus, and her turtles too, Scream, and Hymen's torch burns blue! âWoe,â she croaks, âto man's increase, Quick let propagation cease; Malthus' system shall be tried, And nought but pence be multiplied.â Were all the world like thee and him, A quean so scowling, and so grim, A cynic of so queer a genus, The merry bells had ne'er (between us,) Rang âConsummatum est,â my Venus! The actor mounts his tragic stole, And makes Macbeth exceeding droll; Till, in his periwig combustion, Will. Shakespeare sounds like Irish fustian, In which Macready tears a cat, And Shiel, the patriot, writes so pat; A sort of linsey-woolsey tyrant, Between low comedy, and high rant. The monkey-mimic makes essay, And plays Tom Fool a diff'rent way; When all the company that pass, Are seen reflected in his glass, With air and attitude absurd, Suiting the action to the word! The craniologist, the sconces Feeling alike, of wits and dunces, A doughty argument he thumps, Discoursing learnedly on bumps. Pardieu! if we believe the caitiff, Mine host has got the bump amative! Which Mrs. Brush, who loves phrenology, Says, stands in need of no apology! But see, yon group of merry faces; Sure Punch the genius of the place is; Loud laughter peals, what makes the fun stir? 'Tis Mr. Merryman, the punster. To wake the soul with hum'rous strokes, To crack the sides of honest folks, To banish care, dispel ennui, With social merriment and glee, For this, did Momus, muse of fun, Ordain that jackanapes, a pun! Yet Wit, like folks in higher station, Will sometimes flout this poor relation, And, more provoking still, pretend To treat it as an humble friendâ As some proud Fair, neat, trimly dress'd All in her brilliants and her best, To heighten beauty's magic pow'r, Adorns it with the simplest flow'r; So Wit, from Pun will condescend To borrow grace, as well as lendâ The Dean, that humourist Cervantic, One fav'rite hadâ'twas Pun, the antic! The which he loved passing well, His motto, âVive la Bagatelle!â In little knots the Party split is, Frisking, and chatt'ring in committees: What fidget, fuss, and much ado, How pass the pronouns, I and You! Yet here, behold a nation's hopes; See future Miltons, Drydens, Popes! For these, alas! in sooth to say, Have shone, exhal'd, and pass'd away. Transcending far the ancient school, Hail, Pocock, PlanchÃ¨, Peake, and Poole! All hail, Paul Clifford! mightier Bulwer, To whom e'en Fielding, Smollett, dull were! As thou, supreme in verse and prose art, Lo, Parry outshines Haydn, Mozart! The treasur'd Lore of ages past, Grown out of date, is crumbling fast; Religion, Morals, Party, Sect, Bow to the March of Intellect! That marchâwhich, to the right about Sends Truthâputs Reason to the rout; Bids Virtue haltâ(rare tactics these!) And cries to MoralsââStand at ease!â Behold a tribe, unknown to PhÅbus, Contributors of rhyme and rebus; Old Ladies, Misses in their teens, That warble in the magazines. And then, the little flock of males, That flutter, frisk, and cock their tails; Major Journalists, and minors, Versemen, Prosemen, Penny-a-liners; Gentlemen, who live by guess, Call'd facetiously, âThe Press.â The novelist aristocratic, That starves the author in his attic, And takes his manuscript to Colburn, When he in pity should the whole burnâ Which is the readiest scribe, whose books Go fastest to the pastry-cook's, Or quietly give up the ghost, He best can tell, who prints the most! Now damn'd be he who hears thee puff, And cries, âHal Colburn, hold, enough!â For since the first-born Puffer, down To Packwood's strops, for half-a-crown; Rowland's Macassar, Wright's Champagne, Hunt's patent roastedâ(rogue in grain! Whose Blacking makes our leather soon shine,) Thou art the very prince of moonshine! Blest as th' immortal Gods is he, The lucky scribe, who prints with thee His waste demy, in volumes three! For through the town thy trumpet blows The merits of his verse and prose, Then how he struts, and frets, and crows! And shines (where Fame would blush to enter,) Of ev'ry little group the centre. Cards, what mortal can resist? Loo unlimited, and whistâ Shuffle, cutâthe man of bumps Takes the lead; the wit, the trumps! Laura hopes her Heart to save, But, how absolute the Knave! See it falls a glorious prize; And captive next, her Honour lies! Thus Fortune, in a pack of cards, Each diff'rent character regards; The Tricks she gives to Punster Hood, And the Philosopher is loo'd! Hark, the Music! quiv'ring, quaking, Voices tuning, elbows shaking; Treble, baseâeach throws a hum in, Some folks out of tune, and some in; How they snuffle, squeak, and snort it, Duet, Trio, Quintett, Quartett. Supper pastâthe hour approaches (Hark! I hear the sound of coaches,) When the little group must sever, Cruel fate! but not for ever. Laura, by the silver moon, Drops a tear, but wipes it soon; Edwin writes an ode upon it, L? a rebus, E? a sonnet! Softly pillow'd, be their slumbers Sweet and pleasant as their numbers; Sound, as ev'ry Member's doze When Joe Hume, or Bowring prose; Or, when Science, in a panic, Lulls intelligent Mechanic; Or, at Presbyterian Synod, Where the Elders low and high, nod! Morn appearingâLadies, Bards, Welcome Invitation cardsâ The Philosopherâno sticklerâ In religion not partic'larâ Hopes on Sunday next to see All its lib'ral friends to tea! When 'twill prove beyond denial, Heav'n and Providence a lie all. Afterwards 'twill bring to view Old Society, and Newâ In the first, what roguish priestcraft! In the latter, not the least craft! Halcyon days! when lusty Hymen Shall no more to women tie men; But when each shall choose a dear, Like an âAnnualââev'ry year! Up, disorder! down, decorum! When the Fair shall mount the Forum; Pass their judgments, give their votes, Lycurguses in petticoats! Whenâbut like the Bear and Fiddle, We must break off in the middleâ âSunday next shall solve the riddle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISCELLANEOUS. âTHE NEW VIEW OF SOCIETY.â OR, MR. OWEN AT NEW LANARK. A NEW BALLAD. âNews! neighbours, news!â âOld Song. I, Robert Owen, For certainty knowing Political systems are rotten, Have, with infinite pains, Been confounding my brains, With economy, logic, and cotton. That man's a machine, Will be presently seen, When I've fully develop'd each measure; And my system requires, That I move the wires, That the puppet may dance at my pleasure. Like Noah in his ark, I am king of Lanark! My subjects due deference pay me; You'll find in the sequel, They're perfectly equal;â That's equally bound to obey me! The wise of all ages, Philosophers, sages, Dull rogues! must in turn go to school to me; Aristotle and Plato Are quite out of date O! And Zeno himself is a fool to me. Locke, Newton, and Bacon, I'll prove are mistaken, Poor Malthus I'll down at a blow; Landaff is mere chaff, Hannah More is a bore, And Bob and his job all the go! The Commons and Lords I've so bother'd with words, That they vote me, to save time and patience, Economist clever, Extravagant never, But in one simple thingâmy orations! The faith I maintain, Is a spice of Tom Paine, My politics too, where's the wonder? For argument specious, I poach in Helvetius, Nor Hume quite escapes from my plunder. Some have it, my style Has a touch of Carlile, (Such lies choke the rogues that invent them!) I own there's a touch, When I mystify much, Of my honest old friend, Jerry Bentham! I deny there's a devil, Heav'n, or hell; good, or evil; The doctrine of priests, I cut short all; 'Tis a farce of the schools, That a Providence rules, That the soul is sublime and immortal. That a glorified Being, All-mighty, all-seeing, Of infinite pow'r and dominion, Call'd the stars into birth, Form'd from chaos, the earth,â I'm quite of a diff'rent opinion. But chance, at a jerk, Did the wonderful work, And atoms, combining, concussing, Toss'd, tumbled, and twirl'd Themselves into a world, And then in a frolic, brought us in! Where I'd have ev'ry man, Just as long as he can, For self, and for pelf, live and labour; Then each mother's son, When his dinner is done, Walk off, and make room for his neighbour. The plan I lay down, Is to build a small town, (Some wiseacres call it a riddle!) In the shape of a square, Parallelogram rare! With an eating-house clapp'd in the middle! Where intelligent cooks, Who have studied my books, Their novel experiments trying; Till my favourite plan, To a sop in the pan, Rule the roasting, the broiling, the frying! A bell in a steeple Shall summons my people To join the community's table; Where Christian and Jew, And the devil knows who! Shall complete my edition of Babel. As no priest 's in the place, Let Nic's Chaplain say grace, To quiet some scrupulous laymen; And little Jack Gorgon, My orator, organ! Shall piously chuckle forth âAmen.â 'Tis pleasant enough, Tho' the mutton run tough, To see how the rogues tooth and nail it! Like flies in a shamble, They join in the scramble, With appetite goodâwhat should ail it? Lest brandy, or rum, Should intoxicate some, I banish them both, with Geneva; Instead of blue-ruin, We've Adam's own brewingâ A much better drink, by your leave-a! As soon as my spinners Have finish'd their dinners, (Soup-maigre, if beef they'd the last time,) The girls, for ten minutes, Shall play on their spinnets; The boys dance a hornpipe for pastime. The old men and women I'll treat with the skimming Of some philosophical question; Abernethy, queer chap! Says an afternoon nap Is an excellent thing for digestion! I'll tell the good folk, That religion's a joke, And offer my own, as a sample;â That man is a brute, Is beyond a dispute; My friend, little Jack! for example. That vice is a name, And that virtue's the same, Deserving nor censure, nor creditâ See, my âEssay,â in print, Yet I'll give 'em the hint, As few but myself, may have read it. Economy's this, No advantage to missâ Philanthropy too, is no stickler; Its favourite dish is The loaves and the fishes; Taking care of itself in partic'lar! And liberty also, At least what I call so! Binds only mankind in my slaveryâ And honesty true, Is right worshipful too, When a man can get nothing by knavery! Equality's crown Is to level all down, Who in fame or in fortune o'ercrow us; And then, vice versa, To grind without mercy, The poor needy devils below us! Liberality next, Is the Quaker's old textâ My son, if of wisdom thou'st any, Thou'lt always be found, To make sure of a pound, Before thou dost part with a penny! The bosom that grieves, And the hand that relieves, At pity's soft impulse, is erring: I laugh at the flat, Who would throw out a sprat, Unless he can pull up a herring! Fine feeling's a hum, And a hoaxââHomo sum,â Mere school-boy romance, rhodomontade; We stoics, âjam satis,â Think advice, given gratis, Enough for poor folks, when they want aid. The Owenite rule, Is be cautious, and cool, Indiff'rent to all things, and all men; Your mind, in a freak, Never venture to speak; Truth spoke out of time, may enthral men. In all that you do, Let a sinister view Be your counsel, your guide, and director; In all that you say, Go the round-about way, So ends the first part of my lecture! I hold it imprudent, To drive the young student Up Learning's ascent by coercion; Or e'en to encourage, Beyond his pease-porridge, The task he should learnâfor diversion! My blockheads I teach, Without birching their breech, By a method that well may surprise one;â For Solomon's maxim, That pinches and whacks him, Is certainly far from a wise one! Now here, and now there, Like a dog in a fair! All bustle and smoke, for the fact is, So much I profess, You may easily guess, I'm quite in arrears in my practice! A droll, and a dreamer, A politic schemer, Who knows how to varnish his dross over; A mountebank spouter, An infidel doubter, We now-a-days call aâphilosopher! My son, who, in sooth, Is a sensible youth, A chip of th' old block, you'll suppose is; He now and then chimes, Quantum suff. in âThe Times,â Which the true leading journal, God knows, is! Of fame he bids fair To come in for his share; (I don't know who else can, if not him;) The cunning young shaver Has brass in his favour! A pretty plain proof I begot him! I tried, verbum sat. To illuminate Pat, Full thrice did I lecture before him; But Pat, who loves whiskey, Is rarely in this key, And cried, âBlood and 'Ouns!â not to bore him. So I walk'd off my buff, In high dudgeon enoughâ I'm expected at Liverpool daily, To join for a trip, An American ship, To civilize JonathanâVale! TOM SHUTTLE. âA LAMENTABLE TRAGEDY, MIXED FULL OF PLEASANT MIRTH.â TuneââMiss Bailey.â Tom Shuttle kept in Spital-fields a ready-furnish'd room there; The bards of Greece and Rome, andâBrougham! illum'd him at his loom thereâ He read the Penny Magazine, and talk'd of Thames and Tiber; Of the Mechanics' Institute a regular subscriber! He to the march of intellect, quick marching, bade defiance; A merry cullâa miracle of poetry and science. Miss Wilhelmina Snooks, the daughter of a stout and tall bum- Bailiff in the bottom floor, presented Tom her Album, To draw a head, or write a tale as tragical as Werter, Something pretty-natural, on purpose to divert her! Tom ow'd her one, and wrote an ode, brimful of love and sentiment; 'Twas so sublime you couldn't tell, no, what one word in twenty meant. Miss Snooks made caps, and furbelows, and frills for Mister Harvey, And carried them to Ludgate Hill, safe band-box'd in a jarvey; Now, over head and ears in love, she rants like poor Queen Dido, And ev'ry stitch she lays aside, for one that's in her side, O! She calls for Portia's red-hot coal, the dagger of Lucretia, And bawls for Rosamonda's bowl of rhubarb and magnesia! Tom felt a sympathetic twinge, and try'd a gentle lenitive; âYour bumps, queer file, O,â quoth Deville, âare call'd philo-progenitive! To conquer this amativeness dewelop'd on your cranium, With Wilhelmina go succeed, for she's your succedaneum.â Tom tipp'd a wink, and scamper'd off like winkin, in high feather; The parson fee'dâthe wedding folks had all a feed together! His room with friends was over-run, his cup of bliss run over; He took to mopingâmops and brooms!âhis wife took him to Doverâ The doctor recommended air, and exercise, and jauntingâ Quoth Tom, âHang exercise and air! when, zounds! the right heir's wanting!ââ Away they tripp'd to Bagnigge Wells, to Turnham Green, and Chelsea; Sad Wilhelmina sigh'd, âMy Love I never more shall well see!â 'Twas Fair time, and St. Bartlemy had got a merry touch for him; But rattles, jews-harps, salt-boxes, horns, muffs, might be too much for him! He quite forgot his chronic pains, among his gay old cronies; And munch'd his supper in the pens, of mustard and polonies; The beer bred wit and bravery, and he resolv'd to thump any That cross'd him as he homeward reel'd, and roar'd âWhitbread and Company!â He reach'd his room at two o'clock, the candles in the casement, Foretold the livers by their lights, were all in queer amazement! Such hurry, scurry, mobbing, sobbing, down stairs, ay, and tearing up! âHere's h-ll and Tommy now to do;â cries Tom, âmy wife is flaring up!â Ah! what a sight did he behold, how ghostily and dreadful, When peeping through the door, he threw his peepers on the bed full. There Wilhelmina Shuttle lay, poor lamb, as dead as mutton! Her cheek much whiter than the gown so lily-white she'd put on; A bodkin stuck fast in her side, a letter penn'd so neatly In German Text! bespoke her death, and told the cause completely; âDear Tom, you run stark mad for joy, now try a touch of sadness; You'll find in grief a great reliefâI die, to cure your madness!â Tom stood aghastââ'Tis love! 'tis love! how furious, fond, and fickle hers!â And then he wrote her dad in rhyme the full and true partic'lars; Soon after this felo-de-se, among the prime odd fellows, His spirits rose, he rose to sing, âOld Rose, and burn the bellows!â He cut the loom, a stroller turn'd, and in the Tale of Mystery, He courts Miss Tree!âand so concludes our strange, eventful Hist'ry. SAM TWIST. A LEGEND OF ST. BENNET-FINK. Which may be chanted to the Tune of âMy Love is but a Lassie yet.â Sam Twist was a tailor in Threadneedle-street, His spirits were low, and his fever was high; He lost all his gumption, by a gallopping consumption, And though he didn't like it, he was like to die! âI dispose of, I'm so indispos'd, to my rib, All the goods in my shop, and the money in my till; Though oft, common case! I'd her claws in my face, I sha'n't scratch her off, by a clause in my will! âMy dear, I'll be dress'd like a buck, in my best, Charon won't care a rap, if I'm wrapp'd in a shroud; I'll march to his boat in my blue Sunday coat, For fear Mr. Twist should be lost in the crowd! âAnd if you wed, ah me! a cher ami, Your bed shall be haunted by dolorous tics; My ghost shall knock as it strikes twelve o'clock, And knock you both to spinnage, I swear by Styx!â From top to toe Sam was rigg'd like a beau, Lucy's courage screw'd up, to see him screw'd down; âO, how my heart is beating! was there ever such a sweeting? Except in Sweeting's Alley, where there lives Tom Brown!â Now Tom, under favour, a good-looking shaver, Earn'd his mutton and trimmings by the beards that he trimm'd; His whiskers and jazey set all the women crazy, And he clapp'd their hearts in limbo, he was so smart limb'd! She put off her starch way, her high gait, and arch way, They hob and nob buzz'd, till 'twas buzz'd thro' the town, Some fine day in summer, as black did not become her, Widow Twist, dress'd in white, would be chang'd into Brown! So early in May, on a sun-shiny day, They rose bright array'd, with the rays of the sun; The bells of Bennet-Fink, wouldn't let 'em sleep a wink; And splic'd by a canon, they were off like a gun! They were up on the Downs, being flush of the browns! Then Brown, off to France took his flame, for a flare! He bought her some natty combs, and show'd her the Catacombs, To PÃ¨re-la-Chaise the pair drove in a chaise-and-pair. 'Twas rueful to view ev'ry street written âRue,â Ev'ry book seem'd to Tom, to be written by âTom!â So the lady and her barber return'd by Dover Harbour To Threadneedle-street, which they'd been a month from! Not, tea-and-turn-out, but to dinner and rout, They sent an invite for their neighbours to come: To three fiddle-scrapers the company cut capers, And the ear-piercing fife of their ears pierc'd the drum. With prime whiskey-toddy they moisten'd soul and body, And Bishopsgate-without toasted Bishopsgate-within; Mrs. Brown led her shaver down a dance, and through a quaver; Merry was the dinner, and merrier was the din! It chim'd twelve o'clock, when there came a loud knock, As if Gog and Magog had rapp'd with their fist! The Lane of Saint Bartholomew sent forth a dismal, hollow mew, And in march'd Mister (or his ghost!) Sammy Twist! His mouth grinn'd so grimly, and it smok'd like a chimbley! His nose flar'd red hot, 'twixt his eyes, like a link! He rattled his dry bones, like a cart upon the stones! And danc'd to the muffled bells of Saint Bennet-Fink! âOf Fish,â (cry'd Spirit Sammy,) âhere's a pretty kettle, damme! Cut your stick, and off to Styx; tide serves, the water's high; A wherry's at the ferry, for a pleasant voyage, very! And Lucifer, my Lucy fair! has other fish to fry!â â'Tis high time you're below, hark! the cock begins to crow, And fresh I scent the morning airâere morn, I must away!â When a loud clap of thunder made them both knock under, And then there was old Charon, and the devil too, to pay! Safe landed they were at the Hotel d'EnfÃ¨r, To the âDevil among the Tailors!â in darkness and mist, Danc'd nine grisly sprites in their blue coats and tights, Each claiming, while he licks her! his wife, Widow Twist! The Old one laugh'd like a new one, and quaff'd His goblet of goblin Elixir, or ale. âOne manâ (he cry'd) âat most, is a solitary ghost, But Twist is a Tailor!ââAnd so ends my tale. WOMAN. I sing of Woman; Ladies, lend an ear, The theme is pleasing, and the verse sincere. If Chloe blame my monitory style, I find a recompense in Stella's smile. To laugh at folly let the task be mine, Accomplish'd Stella, to reform it, thine. Some to the Ladies have at once assign'd A trifling heart, a vain, capricious mind; 'Tis too severe, their virtues may demand A juster picture from a milder hand. Kind Heav'n form'd Woman on the social plan, To prove a source of happiness to man; To share alike his blessings and his woes, From life's gay sunshine, to its dreary close. And oft she well performs her tender part, When sharp affliction rends the bursting heart; When the dark tempests of misfortune low'r, She shines with Love's re-animating pow'r. When friendship fails, nor hope, nor succour's nigh, She wipes the bitter tear from mis'ry's eye; Pours consolation's healing balm the while, And cheers the mourner's sorrows with a smile. Tho' form'd for Love, for gentle arts design'd, Her courage argues a superior mind; Not rashly bold, the warlike sword she draws, To violate fond nature's sacred laws; But for some glorious end, some godlike deed, That Kings and Heroes had been proud to bleed! While oft rebellious man, when ills arise, Arraigns th' unerring judgments of the skies; To her superior piety is giv'n, She learns to bless the chast'ning hand of Heav'n. In scenes domestic, scenes which most endear, She shines resistless in her brightest sphere; Close to her bosom prest, with fond alarms, See infant Beauty smiles in all his charms! Endearing sight! O may he ne'er destroy, Thy mother's hope, thy dream of future joy; But by his filial love fulfil thy pray'r, And well repay thy tenderness and care. Fair is the morn, the gilded prospect gay, May no dark wintry cloud obscure the day! When Beauty, blooming like an Eastern Queen, Forsakes the shade to grace a brighter scene. Obsequious coxcombs ev'ry hour assail, For her the flatt'rer weaves his artful tale, Youth, health, and pleasure, all united, seem, One fairy vision, one enchanting dream! Ah! who shall then forewarn the trusting Fair To shun the danger, and avoid the snare; The hesitating speech, the downcast eye, And the delicious poison of a sigh? To please a Woman is a task indeed! We all attempt; alas! how few succeed! A shameful truth, that female charms are sold, Some are with flatt'ry bought, and some with gold. Delia, who once inspir'd the poet's page, Soon finds a ready purchaser, in age. Daphne, who lov'd a fool, mistaken fair! Because he prais'd her beauty, shape, and air; Her raptures over, her illusions past, Longs to obey one willâthat willâhis last! In Woman various characters we find, No two alike in feature, or in mind. Laura, whose spouse is sober once a week, Ne'er felt the flush of anger warm her cheek. Clio, whose scolding tongue affrights the house, Screams at a beetle, trembles at a mouse. Consid'rate Fanny, tender-hearted dame! Will cut her linnet's wings to make him tame: While squeamish Lady Buckram, who would think! Can sip much more than honest topers drink. Amelia wears a smile from morn to night, Because her teeth are regular and white. Priscilla, ancient nymph, by fashion led, To hide the palsy, tosses high her head. Poor Julia makes a hearty meal by stealth, Yet tells the world she has but sorry health! The sturdy vulgar are exempt from pain, 'Tis only folks of quality complain! Say, is not Prudence more than Dian chaste? What mortal man will suit her maiden taste? How cold her eye, it freezes with despair! Love, tender Love, can never enter there! O strange reverse! beneath that artful guise, Some wicked thoughts intrude, and mischief lies. Now view the contrast in Clarissa's air, Light, easy, graceful, spruce, and debonnair! Her laughing eye, soft smile, at once bespeak Love warms her mind, and blushes in her cheek; Blest with each grace that nature can impart To captivate the eye, and charm the heart, Clarissa weds for loveâand, what is worse, A man with brains, but then an empty purse! What sudden friendships has Lucretia made, Eternally betraying, and betray'd! 'Tis hers to heave th' involuntary sigh, The tear unconscious glistens in her eye, Yet, sympathetic soul! she knows not why! If soft Lucretia hear her friend is dead, Her lap-dog's scalded, or her monkey's fled; If Poll no more can charm her gentle ears With dainty oaths, the nymph dissolves in tears! The pity which in female hearts we prize, Flows from no deeper channel than her eyes. Stern Hecatissa gives the world her hate, Her thoughts are fix'd upon a future state; From morn to night, in mere religious whim, She screams aloud her anabaptist hymn! Mistaken fool! put off thy borrow'd part, Learn meekness and sincerity of heart; Heav'n counts thy vows as vain, and nothing worth, Unless a righteous spirit give them birth. Behold yon captious dame, reserv'd, and sly, Suspicion ever lurking in her eye; The very fury of domestic strife, Behold Corinna paleâthe jealous wife! Her spouse, good easy man! she makes a drone, Demure he sits, his eyes are not his own! Speaks he unguarded of another's charms? A mistress! quick her soul is up in arms. She raves, she sighs, the tears obedient start, And well she plays the loud virago's part. How long, Corinna, to conviction blind, Wilt thou torment thyself, and all mankind, With jealous fancies, with suppos'd neglects? âShe most deserves suspicion, who suspects. Prudella, cautious nymph! behind her fan, Gives many an artful leer at odious Man; With paint and patches tries, a silly crime! To hide the fearful ravages of time. When in the Park she takes her night parade, We ask, what spectre 'tis that haunts the shade. She sings an airâthe connoisseur that hears, Would swear a jack were winding in his ears; She joins the danceâthe graces in a fume, Behold the hideous sprite, and quit the room. Chloe, whom perjur'd wits engaging call, Is pleas'd with half mankind, and pleases all. She goes to church on ev'ry Sabbath day, But fashionable people never pray! If parsons are polite, 'tis very well, But Chloe can't endure the name of hell. If some fond fool confess a tender smart, She smiles encouragement, then breaks his heart. Beware how Chloe's kindnesses beguile, Her frown is not so fatal as her smile. Poor Sappho, forc'd to wed against her will The man she hates; and, more provoking still, A thing that ev'ry woman hates alive, A toothless, doting rogue of sixty-five! At midnight balls, and masquerades is seen, And fashionable routs, to cure the spleen; Her ancient lord, a martyr to the gout, For Sappho calls in vainâmy lady's out! Stung with the pangs of jealousy, he swears, Sappho returns, and wonders at his airs; To prove her faith, calls Betty, and the saints, And if occasion suit, my lady faints. But who is she, that sits with head awry, Lank is her form, and haggard is her eye, Her garments turn'd in many a mazy fold, Frantic she seems and ghastly to behold? 'Tis sad Calista, who, with brandish'd quill, Makes ghosts appear, and vampires rise, at will; She writes for demons', not for man's applause, And is herself the fury that she draws. âHigh life is charming, say what people will!â Cries Mistress Fustian, hot from Holborn Hill; âO, who would breathe this vulgar city air, When honest folks might drive a coach and pair? My spouse, dull soul! would rather grub the while, Than sport a handsome house, and live in style.â By fortune's freaks see Madam Fustian plac'd High in the realms of elegance and taste; A well-bred dame, she leaves her bed at noon, Sups with the sun, and breakfasts with the moon! At balls and concerts the presiding belle, For who indeed can dance or sing so well? At fashion's fane she rules the varying year, For who will dress so gay, and pay so dear? Ah! must I tell the sequel of the tale? Poor Madam Fustian's purse begins to fail! The house is sold, the servants all dismiss'd, Her luckless husband dreads the bailiff's fist; Such mad presumption all her friends deride, Guests at her routs, and sharers of her pride! And Mistress Fustian, much against her will, Returns to breathe the air of Holborn Hill! Why sits Clarinda in her garb of woe? Her spouse, sweet mourner! died a week ago; Frantic with grief, she sent for Lady Dâ, Implor'd her tears, and company to tea. For six long days, a penance truly hard! She never saw a play, nor touch'd a card; The seventh, the woeful widow (custom pleads!) Puts off her sorrow, and puts on her weeds. My Lady Cynthia oft, of gaming sick, Will lose her charming temper, with a trick. Nubilia wears a patch, contriving belle! To hide a speck; a mask would do as well. How Flavia's face, and Flavia's picture strike; The cause is plain, they're painted much alike! O then shall truth the voice of satire hush? Fair virtue's true complexion is a blush! But one I know, sweet subject of my lays, Whose beauty still is only second praise; In action graceful, as in sense refin'd, The softest manners, with the chastest mind: Uniting all that we design to please, The charms of temper, elegance, and ease; A fond expression, never reach'd by art, Which speaks the glowing language of the heart! Charms such as these, nor deem the picture rare, Shall render beauty more divinely fair. When man's warm passions, with resistless sway, Bear virtue, truth, and reason far away; One soft persuasive smile shall soon reprove, And call him back to liberty and love. Dear Stella, to my moral verse attend, Forgive the censor, and believe the friend. May ev'ry bliss that softens life, or cheers, Charm thy young days, and crown thy riper years! Fair is the prospect in life's op'ning morn, The rose is fair, but still retains the thorn! The world will tempt thee with alluring praise, And Folly lead thee to her fairy maze, But O, beware! and shun the dang'rous way, They flatter beauty only to betray; And still through life, in thy desire to please, Retain thy soft simplicity and ease. To charm by art let others vainly seek, What art can reach the blossom on thy cheek? And while through life's uncertain path we stray, Hope for our guide to lead us on the way, Say, shall the Muse thy gentle steps attend, Pleas'd to become thy monitor and friend? To tell thee oft how thousands are undone, What paths to follow, and what ills to shun; That vice, though late, shall meet severest doom, That virtue lives and blossoms in the tomb. EPISTLE TO THE PROPRIETOR OF âCUMBERLAND'S BRITISH THEATRE.â A word in your ear, Mr. Cumberland, prayâ Not what I say myself, but what other folks say, I think it just right to communicateâCredÃ¨! Some bitter complaints of your editor G. D. This confident critic bamboozles the town, And to write himself up, he writes other folks down; About the old authors he makes such a fuss, Yet laughs not indeed at our farces, but Us! Talks of Avon's sweet swanâMr. C, who the deuce Is Avon's sweet swan?âDoes he mean Mother Goose? A player must either be dying or dead, To have grace in his action, or sense in his headâ One exception, I grant, may be found in the hive, He praises Jack Harley, who's always alive! Yet Jack, though he giggles and gallops on gaily, Is nothing to Valeâmay he never say valÃ¨!â Then Lord, what an Egotist! quoting himself! âFriend Cumberland, look to your profit and pelf, And take from the dunghill hight critical, no cock Who cannot puff PlanchÃ¨, who cannot puff Pocock; Mr. Lunn, Mr. Bunn, Mr. Pitt, Mr. Poole; The nobs of the new march-of-intellect school. Besides this G. D., if the people all say right, Is not only Aristarch, Poet, butâPlaywright! Which makes him, no doubt, so confoundedly crusty, For two of a tradeâbut the proverb is musty. O blindly infatuate! thus to permit This Midas in judgment, this coxcomb in wit, This snarling Gambado on Pegasus skittish, To gallop right o'er Minor Drama and British!â Then turn to the right-about (Cumberland credÃ¨,) Your pert egotistical editor G. D. Or D.G. no matter which, truce to the lettersâ And give the appointment to one of his betters!â If my humble talent might try such a leap, I'll do the thing well, and I'll do the thing cheap; If Me you invest with the critical staff, Why fine me a pot if I'm found in a laugh. For ShakespeareâI know not and care not who wrote himâ So you'll guess that I'm not very likely to quote him! And Massinger, Fletcher, and surly Old Ben, Shall never be grac'd with a scratch of my pen, They liv'd, scribbled, diedân'importe where, what, and when! My Jerrold's the herald of wit and romance, My Beaumont and Fletcher are PlanchÃ¨ and Dance; What serves me for Congreve, for Cibber and all? The wits, fits, and fancies of Mister Fitzball! No question or quack'ry my Thackeray I wot (What a face for a farce, what a head for a plot!) Is worth all the Drydens and Farquhars that follow; So dub Me your critic, and Him your Apollo! If an author be dullâwhat's his dulness to me? In liberty's land sure a fool may go free! Mine's Dogberry's maxim, (to quote him for once) Let him goâand thank God you are rid of a dunce. When I hold up my rod not a stroller shall tremble, I luckily never saw Siddons or Kemble; Of all the old school I remember not one, But I've seen Mr. Serle, and I've seen Mrs. Bunn. Of acting I yield my opinion to no manâ For buskin and sock give me Cobham and Sloman. Macarthy's a trump, but Macready's a savage, And who would see Dowton that ever saw Davidge? I think Mr. Elton, I think Osbaldiston, In tragedy quite as affecting as Liston; And Gomersal, barring he makes but a sorry beau, I think quite as great as my friend Mr. Horrebow. D.G. is all quibble and quiz when he writes, And when the dog barks least, the sharper he bitesâ Except when I eat, and except when I yawn, My jaw is fast lock'd, and my teeth are all drawn. I'm ready and willing to edit your plays, Find you but the pewter, and I'll find the praise; And if you can gulp only half that I give, You may brag of your swallow as long as you live! So natty I'll dress when you ask me to sup, And your mutton is all I'll presume to cut up; My prose, for your clothes; and your meat for my metre; Your editorâay, and egad, your head-eater! Drop a line to A, with (what in truth, I'm!) a starâ Post paid, and the termsâto be left at the bar Of mine host of (I lodge up three pair, with my crony) The Panniers, and eke the Jerusalem Pony. P.S. If you ask who I am, Mr. Cumberlandâknow I'm one of the club held at Miller'sâ(not Joe!) No G.D.âbe de'ed he! no mountebank, muff; But a little cock-bantamâFlare up! quantum suff. ALIBEG; OR, THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE. In TempÃ¨'s vale, a calm sequester'd scene, Whose fields were cloth'd with everlasting green; Far from the busy world, unknown to fame, There liv'd a youth, and Alibeg his name. Th' admiring swains and ev'ry rural maid, Delighted, sought his consecrated shade, And while he warbled woods and plains among, Apollo listen'd and approv'd the song. One morn great Abbas, tir'd of gay resorts, Thro' TempÃ¨'s vale pursu'd his rural sports; When lo, sweet music quivers thro' the shade, As if the strain some sylvan God had play'dâ And soon the minstrel's self appears in view, His seat, a moss-grown bank, impearl'd with dew, Watching the rippling fountain's silver tide, The while his flocks skipp'd round the mountain side. Enrapt in awe the wondering monarch stood, And then address'd the shepherd of the wood. âO youth celestial! whosoe'er thou art, That with such melting airs enslav'st my heart, Say, dost thou here descend, with heav'nly strains, To soothe the wretch's woe, the Lover's pains; For sure such notes as charm this mystic Bow'r, Are play'd by some divine, superior Pow'r.â The youth repliedââI'm one of humble swains, Who lead their flocks o'er TempÃ¨'s blissful plains, Of parentage obscure, a shepherd boyâ And as I tune this pipe, my only joy, The list'ning Birds on ev'ry bloomy spray, Will raise their notes to imitate the Lay. The Monarch thusââAll gentle as thou art, If grandeur once can captivate thy heart, With me to cities and to courts repair, How will thy worth and talents flourish there! Let not such sweetness wither in a wild, Emblem of virtue, nature's fairest child! But leave these plains, and tend thy sheep no more, And taste of pleasures unenjoy'd before.â A crimson blush o'erspread the shepherd's cheek, His heart exulted, tho' he fear'd to speak: He wept in silence, while his ling'ring feet Reluctant bore him from his lov'd retreat. Now distant cities from afar they view'd, Expanding wide, as onward they pursued; All seem'd a bright and glorious visionâyet He heav'd a parting sigh of fond regret. To court the youth was led, in glitt'ring vest, Each noble heart admir'd the humble guest; His manly beauty, and superior worth, Made all forget his lowliness of birth; Such native sweetness, mix'd with decent pride, Brav'd slander's sting, and envy's scorn defy'd. As some fair Flow'ret in a wild conceal'd, Where no kind pasture bids its blossoms yield; Check'd in its growth, requires a fost'ring hand Gently to move it to some fertile landâ But when transplanted to more genial earth, The bloom appears, and gives its beauty birth; Urg'd by warm suns, and mild refreshing dews, The buds burst forth in all their lively hues; Its lovely form rewards the planter's care, And with ambrosial fragrance fills the air. While thus the swain enjoys his virtuous deeds, Great Abbas diesâthe sorrowing nation bleeds;â Religion, justice, peace, a glorious train, And gentle mercy mark'd his pious reign. And now the Son, a youth of noble fire, Succeeds his honor'd and lamented sire; Like him, to prove a blessing to the State, A Sov'reign truly wise, and truly great. But Envy strove to blast the shepherd's fame, And blend with hateful infamy his nameâ The Monarch heardâhis rising fears prevailâ For cunning slander thus devis'd the tale. A place there is, unknown to public eye, Where close conceal'd, the stolen treasures lie; Of curious structure, where the artist's skill Has try'd to thwart the bold intruder's willâ Oft is he seen to ope the secret door, And look with rapture on the hidden store; Linger, as if his soul were treasur'd there, And fondly hoard it with a miser's care. Forth went the King the hidden store to seek, While joy and triumph flush'd the Shepherd's cheek! The secret door is open'd to their eyes, And all behold the long expected prize! No precious gold, or jewels meet their sight, 'Twas humbler treasures gave the swain delightâ All they beheldâthe knotty crook he bore, The tuneful pipe, the shepherd's garb he wore When first he met the royal Abbas' view, And with his music charm'd the sylvan crew; Before he felt the force of slander's tale, And left the joys of TempÃ¨'s blissful vale! âTake all,â he cried, âwith pleasure I restore The gifts your royal father gave before; Such fleeting honours freely I resign, All are your ownâbut these are truly mine! Think on those days of innocence and joy, When you beheld me first, a shepherd boy, Rais'd by your sire, unworthy and unknown, To form his councils, and to guard his throne.â Then let me to my native shades repair, And once more learn to tend my fleecy care; Tune my neglected pipe, and wear the vest, In which your father found me, truly blest; Before I knew the mis'ry to be great, The sad memorials of my happier state! Abash'd, confounded, at the artless tale Vice stood appall'd, and slander's face grew pale; While lynx-ey'd malice yields to virtuous fame, And hides its head in everlasting shame. âO matchless worth!â th' indignant Abbas cried, âBlush ev'ry child of supercilious pride! See, in this youth, fair virtue's purest fire, With which the gods immortal minds inspire! Hence from my sight, ye persecuting race, No more the monarch, or his realm disgrace; Let honest men my people's freedom guard, And modest merit meet its just reward: Let worth once more my injur'd kingdom sway, No more let humble virtue, vice obey; But all be chang'd, and royal Abbas' son Bestow the laurel where 'tis nobly won.â The monarch rais'd, in token of his grace, The prostrate shepherd, with a fond embrace; While conscious guilt in silence stole away, And virtue won the honours of the day. IMMORTALITY. If aught can check the voice of unbelief, Dispel the sceptic's doubt, and shame his sneer, And fill the soul with reverential awe, 'Tis the dull hour of night, when nature sinks In sleep profound, and ev'ry object leads The mind to contemplation. Let me roam At this impressive hour the church-yard way, And by the moon's pale beam, attentive mark Where wealth and poverty unheeded lie.â That I am mortal, each surrounding grave Speaks with a solemn voice; and that my soul Immortal, and inform'd of heav'nly fire, Shall know a second birth, and one day rise In bright, unsullied beauty, radiant hope Assures, confirms me in the pleasing thought. Death, once the common foe of all mankind, Is now the friendâthe wise, experienc'd sage Who, after all the pilgrim's toils and cares In passing thro' this wilderness of woe, Conducts him safely to a better home. Sweet are his slumbers, peace and hope divine Rest on his pillow, and when morning beams, He joins with nature in the gen'ral song, And loud Hosanna! O if joys so pure Bud in this earthly vale, to bloom in heav'n, To live 'tis pleasure, but 'twere bliss to die. How ill do riot and intemp'rate mirth Befit this solemn hour, by Heav'n design'd For holy contemplation!âFor of old Our purer ancestors would silent sit On some high mountain, and with eye serene Muse on the glorious majesty of Heav'n! But now, the wretch by fraud or vengeance led, Like the gaunt prowling wolf, that leaves his den Intent on slaughter, points the murd'rous knife Against a brotherâdeeds of darkest hue At this defenceless, consecrated hour Receive their birthâO Guardian of the good! Let not thy choicest blessing, balmy sleep, That courts the peasant's pillow, but retires From gilded domes, and canopies of state, Be scar'd by frightful fears, and ghastly dreams Of dread assassins, and of midnight groans! Chain up these wolves, nor let them roam the night To murder, what they never can enjoy, The heav'nly blessings of a sweet repose. Let vain philosophy, upheld by pride, Say that the soul, once parted from her clay, Is then extinct, nor spark of heav'nly fire, Nor ray divine, shall warm the sacred fane Where wisdom, virtue, and religion pure, Dwelt in celestial concord.âWhence the end That man receiv'd his being; why endow'd With such high pow'rs, and by his Maker form'd In his own beauteous image, and in state A little lower than th' angelic host? Were there no certain hope of future bliss, What would inspire the virtuous and the brave To meet the face of danger without fear, And smile on death? What makes the dying saint, When writhing nature, agonis'd with pain, Struggles to be reliev'd, with holy joy View the dark silent vale he soon must pass, Nor tremble at the sight? 'Tis the blest hope Of Immortality that cheers the soul, And fits her for the awful, trying hour Of Death. Heard ye a deep and hollow groan That breath'd despair? Mark truly whence it came. See, on his dying bed the Atheist lies, He, who in Life's gay pageantry and pride, Ne'er let the thought of heav'n, the dread of hell, Mar the light moments of his jovial day:â But now, diseases fell, and loathsome ills Torture his joints, and anguish fills his mind. Where can he look for succour? Where! to heav'n? Alas! what hope is there? A dreadful doubt O'erwhelms his soul, his eyeballs roll in vain To find some friend to calm his anxious fears, And ease him of his load: no kindred friend, Companion of his vices! dare approach The bed of death, where ribald scorn might learn A deep mementoâMem'ry, draw a veil In pity o'er the restâO God, forgive! Yes, I will trust, and triumph in the hope Of immortality, tho' fools may jeer. If in no future world the soul shall wake, They never can accuse me of the cheat:â So let me die in the delightful dream, And sweet delusion, of a world to come. 'Tis midnight now: the busy world is still; Some, rack'd with torture, wake the peaceful hour With horrid groans, and pray for coming morn; While some, disturb'd in mind, as conscience brings To busy recollection, deeds of ill, Bedew their pillow with repenting tears, And weep till day. Remorse, and hidden guilt Point all their sharpest arrows. Black despair Forth from his murky cavern stalks along With hurried stride, to where the pris'ner lies In lonely dungeon, and the knell of death Rings in his ears; the sleepy bird of night Screams to the howling blast her piteous moan; The raven claps his wing, the sullen bat Flits thro' the air, and if report be true, Departed spirits have appear'd to men, And little fairies tripp'd it o'er the green, Beneath the moonlight shade.âAh! turn a thought To where the sinking mariner forlorn, Whom winds and waves o'erpow'r, struggles for breath, To stem the boiling torrent:âvain his hope To reach yon wish'd for shore,âanother surge, More dreadful than the last, o'erwhelms him soon.â A mournful sight the morrow will disclose, His lifeless body stiff'ning in the blast. O! what a dismal sound salutes my ears, That rung the knell of some departed soul. It comes from yonder tow'r, where Pontiff pride, And bigot cruelty together hold Their midnight orgiesâ'Twas Narcissa's knell! Peace to thy gentle shade! where'er it roves, By fairy-circled plain, or moonlight stream, Or cloisters pale, to tell thy tale of woe!â Religion, in her best and purest state, Unhurt by superstitionâunenthrall'd By odious customs, cruelty, and death, Is beautiful! the attribute of heav'n. Meek, patient, chasteâthe messenger of peace To all who will receive; she throws new light On what was dim beforeâand thro' her glass Things which were once unheeded, please us now. In her the Gospel's deep and solemn truths Shine with celestial splendour; there the soul May contemplate the themes that once inspir'd The prophet's eloquence, the seraph's song. Not the religion, horrible the name, Of crafty monks, and bacchanals impure. Unhallow'd mock'ry!â'Tis the sacred flame That warms the heart with gratitude and love For that Eternal Pow'r in whom we live, That constitutes religion's sacred nameâ That makes poor helpless man a friend to man, And brings the heart to triumph in the good, Not of itself, but all. Curs'd is the wretch Who makes his wealth his god! no other hope Shall cheer his dying hourâno pitying tear Shall wash his stains away, nor mournful sigh Welcome his soul to bliss. Unhappy man! Thy god shall leave thee when thou need'st one most! Affliction! thou art physic to the soul, And wholesome tooâthou mak'st the patient weak, To cool the fever of his bloodâthy hand, Oft rude and harsh by erring mortals deem'd, Is always mercifulâthou never strik'st But where thou mean'st to raise, and chast'nest not, But in thy tend'rest Love.â Guilt through the world may flaunt in rich array, And honesty in rags;âknaves may feast high, While virtue starves:âbut God, still just and good, Has stores unknown and happiness for allâ Some have their portion here, and some in heav'n. When on the bed of pain oppress'd I lay, My trust was in the Lord, and not in vainâ His mercy was a pillow to my head, A balsam to my heartâthe shades of death Were gather'd round me, but my soul rejoic'd In his salvation, and my hope was sure. What, tho' thou sitt'st in majesty supreme Amid the heav'n of heav'ns! and with thy rays Giv'st glory to ten thousand burning suns Encircling thy throne: tho' angels stand With golden harps attun'd, and voices rais'd In heav'nly concert, thou art still my God, And thou wilt hear me, tho' with feeble breath I pour the grateful song, and trembling bend Before the holy altar of thy Grace! O let me never prostitute the Muse, The gift of heav'n, my solace and my pride, To themes unworthy of her sacred fire. But like the bird that carols in the morn With notes of joy, and at the close of day Pours forth a parting song and sinks to rest, When morning rises, and when ev'ning falls, In sunshine and in shade, be Thou my theme! And when pale death, disarm'd of ev'ry sting, Shall hush the fault'ring music of my lyre, May my rejoicing spirit, freed from sin, And ev'ry mortal stain, to Thee ascend A pure and fit inhabitant for heav'n, Worthy its great Creator! there to join With angels and archangels, in the song Of man's redemption, and of Him whose birth Recording seraphs hail'd with hymns of joy, Till heav'n's eternal courts responsive breath'd Celestial musicâwhose sojourn below Was mark'd with sorrow, infamy, and death. In majesty, on God's right hand, behold He sits the righteous judge; his bruised head No more encircled with a crown of thorns, But princely diademâGlory to thee, Fountain of light and life, for this sure hope, That my immortal spirit shall awake With new-born rapture from her earthly tomb, And thro' eternal ages sing thy love In hymns of endless joy, and endless praise. THE NATIVITY. AN ODE. O for a sound more soft and clear, Than burst upon the ravish'd ear, When touch'd with God's ethereal fire, The holy Bard, in lofty lays, Broke forth in prophecy and praise, And bade his soul-subduing lyre Foretell the bright events of future days! And Thou, who tun'd the varying strings Of David's harp to sounds of woe, When angels bow'd their silver wings To hear the heav'nly numbers flow, When I attempt immortal rhyme, A theme so sacred, so sublime, That bade all heav'n with hallelujahs ring; Let holy zeal each note prolong, And breathe thy spirit o'er the song Of God's anointed Son, and heav'n's eternal King! O Salem! what a day is thine, Behold the Star of mercy shine, See hope her hallow'd temple rears! Lift up your eyes, and hail the morn, To you a holy babe is born, The child of promis'd years; Music floats on ether wings, The woods rejoice, the desart sings! Bow your heads, ye mountains high, Assembled nations prostrate fallâ Hark! the hills exulting cryâ âHe brings salvation down to all!â Softly sweet the echo ringsâ âGlory to the King of Kings! And peace to men be giv'n.ââ Praise him ye planets as ye roll, Ye stars that gild yon shining Pole, And all ye Hosts of heav'n! Lo, the sound hath reach'd the skies! Hark! what strains seraphic rise Among the heav'nly choirsâ List'ning saints their voices raise, Swell the chorus of his praise, And strike their golden Lyres! To thee redemption's work is dear, Thy love shall wipe the sinner's tear, Thy hand his cruel bondage break:â The dumb shall lift their song to thee, The lame shall walk, the blind shall see; Thy voice shall bid the dead awake! To those of meek and lowly heart, Thy grace shall sov'reign balm impart, And prove the saints' eternal guide; The fainting soul thy Shepherd's care Shall gently lead to pastures fair, Where Zion's crystal waters glide. No more shall war, with iron reign, His death-denouncing trumpet blow; Heap up his mountains of the slain, And fill the world with woe.â But heav'nly Peace, on dove-like wing, To all shall loud Hosannahs sing, While heathen lands, with cheerful voice, A Saviour's glory shall proclaim, And learn the music of his name, Afric, behold thy Kingârejoice! rejoice! In that dread hour of mortal doom, When Death shall final ruin spread; And earth, from ev'ry yawning tomb Shall render up her deadâ Thy saints, on wings of angels borne, With joyful hymns shall hail the morn, When, to relieve the sinner's woes, To save his soul from guilty fears, And wipe away repenting tears, Prompt at the gracious call, the Star of Mercy rose. ODE TO MELANCHOLY. If aught can raise the drooping heart Above the world's delight and folly, And all sublimer thoughts impart, 'Tis heav'nly, pensive melancholyâ How glorious 'tis, at twilight hour, To sit and watch from yonder tow'r The silver moon arise! The mind expanding, bears her wings, Above all sublunary things, And mingles with the skies. Then let me seek the solemn scene, When all is silent and serene Beneath the starry pole; When pleasure's fev'rish dreams are o'er, And busy cares disturb no more The contemplative soul. Or slowly pace, with musing tread, The dreary mansions of the dead, Where senseless marbles weep; And saints that former ages blest, Within their earthly caverns rest In everlasting sleep. There melancholy loves to dwell, And listen to the passing bell, That speaks our mortal doom; With pensive form, and haggard stare, She bends, the picture of despair, O'er Beauty's early tomb.â She, with her sister madness, oft On some high rock will sit aloft, That foaming billows sweep, And while all nature feels dismay, With fix'd, unalter'd eye survey The tempest, and the deep. But when in some secluded cell, She tunes her wild, pathetic shell, Soft Zephyrs breathe around; The Shepherd's pipe upon the hill Is hush'dâthe vocal woods are still, To hear the mournful sound! Hark! music strikes the list'ning ear, In notes more thrilling, plaintive, clear, Than e'er to man were given; Sweet as the sounds that angels sing When loud applauding seraphs bring A chosen saint to heav'n. 'Tis Mona's bardâwith magic sweep,â Who rais'd the spirits of the deep In Fingal's dreary cave; High on a mountain's tow'ring spire, He wakes the music of his Lyre, O'er many a warrior's grave. When wand'ring ghosts, as Legends tell, Forsook the dismal caves of hell, To haunt the midnight gloom; And while the distant thunder roll'd, Would oft to mortal ears unfold The secrets of the tomb! Hail holy shade! whose harp divine, O'er druid's altar, hero's shrine Awoke in dying fallsâ No more thine airy music floats In solemn, sad, and swelling notes Thro' Mona's desart walls.â Hail, Melancholy, Pow'r sublime! Which naught but all-consuming time Shall vanquish, or destroy! When earth shall melt, and sea, and skies, O! may thy troubled Spirit rise To everlasting joy. ODE. NIGHT. The Sun with mild declining ray, Proclaims the hour of parting day, And thro' the dusky plain The swain his ev'ning carol sings, And night once more on sable wings, Resumes her silent reignâ The lover mourns beneath the shade, For broken vows, and hopes betray'd, And friendship's cold return: And where departed merit sleeps, Affection her lone vigil keeps, And bathes the laurell'd urn. Now, while the thoughtless and the gay, Life's fleeting moments pass away In festive hall, or bow'r; Let me, while nightly dews descend, In silent meditation spend The solitary hour. Glory to thee, in holy hymn, Who sitt'st amid the cherubim, High Lord of heav'n alone! My God, my Father, and my Friend! With humble gratitude I bend Before thine awful throne! If e'er in deed, in word, or thought, I've been by passion blindly taught From virtue's path to steer, O let me to thy throne repair With humble penitence and pray'r; Nor thou refuse to hear. Incline my heart to wisdom's rule, And try me in affliction's school, And teach my erring mind To know that pleasure, glitt'ring toy, Yields but a transitory joy, And leaves a sting behind. Tho' light'nings flash, and tempests low'r, He shall outlive the dreadful hour Who stands in worth secureâ Pure as the current of the rills, Firm as the everlasting hills, Shall virtue's self endure. And now, with earthly care opprest, My Spirit, Father! sinks to rest, Be thou my guardian Pow'r; And thro' the silent reign of night, Let sleep descend in slumbers light, As saint's expiring hour. AN APRIL DAY. Dear Emma, on that infant brow Say why does disappointment low'r? Ah, what a silly girl art thou, To weep to see a summer show'r! O, dry that unavailing tear, The promis'd visit you shall pay; The sky will soon again be clear, For 'tis, my love, an April Day. And see, the sun's returning light Away the transient clouds hath driv'n; The rainbow's arch, with colours bright, Spreads o'er the blue expanse of heav'n; The storm is hush'd, the winds are still, A balmy fragrance fills the air; Nor sound is heard, save some clear rill Meand'ring thro' the valleys fair. Those vernal show'rs that from on high Descend, make earth more fresh and green; Those clouds that darken all the air Disperse, and leave it more serene: And those sad tears that for a while Down sorrow's faded cheek may roll, Shall sparkle thro' a radiant smile, And speak the sunshine of the soul! While yet thy mind is young and pure, This sacred truth, this precept learnâ That He who bids thee all endure, Bids sorrow fly, and hope return: His chast'ning hand will never break The heart that trusts in Him alone; He never, never will forsake The meanest suppliant at his throne. The world, that with disdainful pride To vice gives virtue's modest due, From thee, alas! may turn asideâ Ah, shun the fawning, flatt'ring crew! And blest with cheerfulness and health With joy thy daily course to run, Let wretches hoard their useless wealth, And Heav'n's mysterious will be done. With fair Religion, woo content, 'Twill bid tempestuous passions cease; And know, my child, the life that's spent In pray'r and praise must end in peace: Its fitful dream is quickly past, A little while we linger here; And tho' the morn be overcast, The ev'ning may be bright and clear. DEATH. Cease, Fool, to mourn life's little span, And hush that impious cry, For what an abject thing were man, If he were ne'er to die. Yet grant thee all thy soul's desire, A free, immortal state; Soon immortality would tire, And thou would'st curse thy fate: Wealth, honours, all the world can give, And soft, luxurious ease, The charms for which men crave to live, Would lose their pow'r to please. But Death, tho' harsh to worldly ears, To misery and to me, Sounds like the musick of the spheres, Celestial harmony! It mingles in one common clay, Th' oppressor and th' opprest; It wipes the tears of grief away, And gives the weary rest. It bids the trembling miser part From his ill-gotten store; It terrifies the stoutest heart, That never shook before. It quite unnerves the warrior's arm, It makes the haughty bow; And rudely withers ev'ry charm On beauty's heav'nly brow. Its voice unbars the prison-door, And sets the captive free; The slave endures the lash no more, But springs to liberty. It conquers woe, disease, and pain, All private, publick strife; And snaps at once the heavy chain That binds us fast to life. And from a sorrowing world like this, And fortune's with'ring frown, It leads to everlasting bliss, To conquest and a crown. Then cease to mourn life's little span, And hush that impious cry; For what an abject thing were man, If he were ne'er to die. WRITTEN FOR A DYING FRIEND. Eat the bread, and drink the wine, Symbols pure of love divine; Is thy soul with fears distress'd? These shall charm them all to rest. Come, all sinful as thou art, Bring a broken, contrite heart; Faith in Christ thy hope, thy stay, Then thy stains are wash'd away. Lord! while low in pray'r we bend, Let thy righteousness descend; Holy confidence inspire, And touch the soul with living fire. HYMN. Be Jehovah's name ador'd, For abundant mercies giv'n; Sing we praises to the Lord, Glory to the King of Heav'n! From his sapphire throne on high, He hath heard a father's pray'r; He hath heard a mother's cry, And hath stretch'd his arm to spare! Winter, stern, relentless pow'r, Promis'd thee an early tomb; Spring restores with sun and show'r, Thine, and nature's tender bloom: From thy fragile form hath driv'n Slow-consuming, wan disease; And hath sent, with wings from heav'n, Health upon the morning breeze! Mark the weak and palsied limb By degrees its strength resume; And those eyes, so sickly dim, Quick their wonted fires illume: See those cheeks, with hope elate, Own the sun's reviving rays! Hark! that voice,âso silent late,â Joins the grateful song of praise. For thy Father's saving grace, Humble, grateful homage pay, In his holy dwelling place, Hour by hour, and day by day. 'Tis a glimpse of transports higher Thou in happier realms shalt know; Less than this can He require? Less than this canst thou bestow? Be Jehovah's name ador'd For abundant mercies giv'n; Sing we praises to the Lord, Glory to the King of Heav'n! MORNING. Had I a harp by angels strung, A seraph's voice, a prophet's tongue, My soul, to heav'n's high King, Now, while from ev'ry dewy thorn The merry birds salute the morn, Should hallelujahs sing. But though no saint or seraph's fire Hath touch'd my lip, or tun'd my lyre, To animate my lays; Do thou from thine ethereal sphere, In tender mercy deign to hear, And pardon while I praise. âIs there a God?â the sceptic criesâ Who form'd the earth, who built the skies? By whose command divine Do yonder circling planets run, And that celestial orb, the sun, In all its glory shine? Who gave thee life? whose saving pow'r Upholds thee in affliction's hour, Nor leaves thy soul to weep? Whose mighty voice, and sov'reign will, Bid the tempestuous waves be still, And calm the roaring deep? Whose bounteous hand each beauty yields That gilds the skies, and paints the fields, And all in heav'n and earth? Who gives the moon her silver rays, The morning stars their brighter blaze, That hail'd Creation's birth? Who, when the battle's rage begins, And war, to scourge a nation's sins, Assumes its giant form, Directs the carnage from on high, And bids the warrior stand, or fly? The Genius of the storm! Who, when upon the bed of death The bleeding hero pants for breath Beneath the fatal blow, Whispers, in soothing sounds of love, He shall enjoy, in realms above, His glories gain'd below? 'Tis God! whose throne is fix'd on high, Lord of the universe, and sky, Whom earth and heav'n revere; Whose mercy guards us ev'ry hour, Whose beauty blossoms in the flow'r, And crowns the varied year! Eternal truths though myst'ry veil, When man hath chang'd his nature frail, Those truths shall God reveal: Earth shall to her foundations shake, When he the book of life shall take, And break the sacred seal. A pilgrim in this world of strife, Thy faith, my staffâthy breath, my life,â Thy hope, and promise giv'n,â The pow'r of sin and death destroy, Make doubt, belief; and sorrow, joy; And earth, a step to heav'n. THE BEGGAR'S PETITION. There is a debt we all must pay, The sooner it is paid the better; Come, tyrant Death, why this delay? I wish not to remain thy debtor. Some ask a year, a month, an hour; Nay, some implore a moment's credit! And though, like them, I know thy pow'r, Come when it will, I do not dread it. Nor houses, lands, nor gold have I,â Let Fortune, jade! say why, and wherefore; Then what have I to do but die? With nothing left on earth to care for. Life is a feastâa strange one too! To fare but poorly I've been able; Yet seen enough to pall my viewâ So let me now retire from table. If twenty years I've still on earth T' exist, for I'm a young beginner; Give ten to that gay son of mirth, And ten to yon old trembling sinner! I value not this boon of life, Its boasted joys are all a bubble: Youth is a scene of envy, strife, And age of av'rice, toil, and trouble. RESIGNATION. Say, is the struggle more severe That ends our mortal strife, Than watching, waiting, ling'ring here, With a distaste for life? It cannot beâa moment's pain, And lo, the dart is sped! No more we drag affliction's chain, The living are the dead. But when disease assails the mind, When ev'ry hope 's destroy'd, And life appears a boon unkind, A sad, a dreary void; When gath'ring clouds and tempests low'r, Without a ray to cheer, Death has not in his darkest hour Affliction so severe. Taste, genius, high attainments all, For what are ye design'd? As plagues to fill the heart with gall? As torments for the mind? The careless world looks down with scorn On intellectual fires; And he indeed is most forlorn Whom genius most inspires. Yet mourn not vainly, suff'ring man, At this, thy fate o'ercast; Life, good or ill, is but a span, Which cannot always last. And fondly hope, amidst thy woe, To make the balance even; That those whom sorrow marks below, Are doubly blest in heaven. ON THE DEATH OF THE PRINCESS CHARLOTTE. 'Tis past!âthe funeral knell is rung, The solemn requiem for the dead Is hush'dâthe dirge of death is sung! A nation's tears have all been shed. Within the grave's sepulchral gloom A purer spirit ne'er repos'd; And never yet the silent tomb Upon a richer treasure clos'd. Do wealth and honours swell thy trainâ Say, what are wealth and honours now? Does fleeting beauty make thee vainâ Go gaze upon that lifeless brow! Does youth, with ev'ry charm to please, A judgment clear, a taste refin'd, Attemper'd sweet with native ease, Or flatt'ry's voice uplift thy mind? Reflect on Charlotte's early doom, And mark the triumph of the tomb! But if with nobler passions fraught, Thy soul, despising meaner things, Aspire to dignity of thought, A great ambition, worthy kings! If to religion's sacred zeal The love of liberty be join'd; With charity, to deeply feel The sorrows that afflict mankindâ Rejoice! for to unspotted worth Behold what rich rewards are giv'n; Living, dyingâpeace on earth, And Immortality in Heav'n. FRIENDSHIP. Ah, Friendship! how oft have I try'd To find thee, but ever in vain; 'Midst the turbulent children of pride, And the humble delights of the plain. And when, at thy glorified shrine My heart hath her orisons paid; Hope, smiling, presented thee mine, I follow'dâbut found thee a shade! 'Tis Love that awakens our fires, While Friendship with sympathy glows; 'Tis Beauty inflames our desires, And Friendship that softens our woes. When hope has forsaken the mind, And nought but despair is in view, How happy the wretch who can find A heart that to Friendship is true! Then give me these blessings supreme, Ye powers indulgent above, The Friend, who shall gain my esteem, And the fair, who shall merit my love. HOPE. What though the shades of death descend On her my soul holds dear; And those that o'er her pillow bend, May soon surround her bierâ My fainting heart shall not despair, But look beyond the grave: Hath pitying heav'n less will to spare? Hath God less pow'r to save? Yet happier they, who call'd to rest, Ere sorrow fades their bloom, Awhile a blessing areâand blestâ Then sink into the tombâ For them the Spring's gay buds appear, And Summer paints the flow'r; They fall, ere Autumn's leaf is sear, Or wintry tempests low'r. And tho' they part with fond regret, While still the leaves are green; How mournful they, imprison'd yet, Who long to quit the scene. The broken heart may heave a sigh, E'en while it bows to heav'n; And if a tear bedew my eye, That tear shall be forgiven. THE WORN-OUT TAR. âNavita de ventis, de taurus narrat arrator, Enumerat miles vulnera, pastor oves.â The ship was now in sight of land, And crowds from shore with joy did hail her, The happy hour was nigh at hand When each sweet lass would see her sailor: How gallantly she ploughs her way! To England's shores returning back; And ev'ry heart is light and gay, Except the heart of honest Jack. From hardy youth to vig'rous age, With sturdy arm he stemm'd the wave; And in the battle's hottest rage He fought, the bravest midst the brave: And many a bitter sigh he gave, And scarce suppress'd the starting tear; He wish'd the sea had prov'd his grave, Some shot had clos'd his long career. For he was old, his frame was worn, His cheek had lost its manly hue; Unlike his glory's rising morn, When big with hope his fancy grew: Yet was his heart as firm and true; In his lov'd country's cause as warm, As when he cheer'd his gallant crew To face the foe, or brave the storm! By time, and toil, and sickness chang'd, From friends, from home, and kindred dear, For thirty tedious years estrang'dâ When he, long lost, shall reappear, How will they start his voice to hear! And bless the day he ceas'd to roam, And fondly dry each grateful tear, And welcome the poor wand'rer home! Then, while the children climb his knees, And youth and age stand list'ning by, He'll tell, when oft he plough'd the seas, Winds blew, and waves ran mountains high; And, while a tear bedews each eye, Declare, but in a falt'ring tone, He saw the gallant Nelson die, And heard the hero's parting groan. How, as he gloriously expir'd, Dread war a fiercer aspect wore; As Britain's sons, with vengeance fir'd, Bade all their brazen cannons roar; Till rude Trafalgar's rocky shore, And heaving ocean's depths profound, Proclaim'd the conq'ring chief no more, And echoed back the solemn sound. How once the ship was tempest driv'n, In Biscay's deep and treacherous Bay, Without one blessed star from Heav'n To light her on her lonely way; O, then 'twas first he learn'd to pray! And own th' Almighty's sov'reign will; When He, whom winds and seas obey, Stretch'd forth his armâand all was still. How, captive in a foreign land, Far off, beneath the burning zone, Th' abode of men, a savage band, Who worshipp'd idols of their own: He made the glorious Gospel known; With reverential awe they heard, And bow'd before Jehovah's throne, And bless'd Salvation's sacred word. When wounded on the deck he lay, And death stood by with terrors grim, And eager monsters watch'd their prey, And sea-birds sang his funeral hymn, Death had no slavish fears for him! Let cowards shrink at every ballâ What! if he lost his life, or limb, His king and country claim'd it all. Now let the wand'rer rest in peace, And wear out life's remaining span; Here let the bold inquirer cease The will of Providence to scan: Dark are the ways of God to man! And he who bears misfortune's blast, Shall bless each wise mysterious plan, And anchor safe in Port at last. THE PILGRIM. I am a weary Pilgrim, on my way To the far ocean of Eternity; Silent, forlorn, and faint of heart, I stray, And long to pass the brinkâit must not beâ He, at whose voice the vivid lightnings flee, And the loud thunders cease, hath plac'd me here; And sooner may yon sun desert his sphere, Those orbs unbidden shoot their course from Heav'n, Than I, by fell despair and madness driv'n, Plunge headlong in that dark mysterious seaâ Let Heav'n's own mandate set the pris'ner free. Has life no higher end than joys of sense, Inglorious ease, rude mirth, and low desire? Is hope extinct with man when summon'd hence? Dwells there no portion of ethereal fire In his frail image, once the bright attire Of genius, virtue, dignity, and worth? Tho' for a little season bound to earth, He was ordain'd by the immortal Sire, For everlasting worlds, communion higher With glorious spirits, perfected by grace, Who suff'ring, fainted not, but run their race. How grand the contemplation! how sublime To mark yon sun mount high in golden streams! And think the immortal soul, unchain'd by time, Shall rise refulgent like those orient beamsâ But not to setâHence, vain perplexing dreams! Distract with doubt the dreary sceptic's mindâ Altho' the narrow path to me assign'd Be strew'd with briers and thorns, and toil and care; I ask not this philosophy to bear; Enough for me the gracious promise giv'n, Of time on earth, eternity in heav'n! Yet mindful of thy goodness, I implore Thee, my eternal Father and my Friend, Ere I am summon'd hence, and seen no more, Patience and consolation thou wouldst send; Grant me a blameless life, a peaceful end, For bliss I may not ask this side the tombâ Yet for thy mercy's sake, dispel the gloom That clouds my spiritâmake this shining frame, This world of joy, prosperity, and fame, Less dark to me, and desolate appear, As long as 'tis thy will I linger here. To die is painful only when we part From those by friendship, nature, kindred dear; These bind, with adamantine chain, the heart, And give to death its terrorsâhow severe To leave the few we lov'd and valued here, To buffet with the world, and bear its frown! Friend of the fatherless! look pitying down On those I leave behind! be thou their stay, Their guardian, guide thro' life's eventful day; Let fate on them with milder influence shine, Nor wound their hearts as it has wounded mine. THE PENITENT. Scene.âThe Chamber of Death. ATTENDANT.âPENITENT. Att. And hast thou drain'd the poison'd bowl? Speak, pallid victim of despair! Remorse and horror shake thy soul For hidden guilt too strong to bearâ And what a bitter groan was there! Ah! sure thy crime is dark and deepâ If hell hath terrors, breathe a pray'r; If heav'n hath joys, repent and weep. Pen. O torture not my bleeding breast, Nor add to death a pang more keen; On earth I sought in vain for rest, So hasten'd to a calmer scene: The sleep eternal how serene, That brings oblivion to my woe!âAtt. But there's an awful gulf between, Which thou must pass, or sink below. Pen. Disciples of the Atheist creed Exult, your victim here behold! Applaud the hand, approve the deed; Your lesson teaches to be bold! See one who by your arts controll'd, Hath ev'ry tie of nature riven; Friends, fortune, fame, existence sold; All joy on earth, all hope in heaven. With you, ye philosophic train, New schemes I form'd, new systems try'd, The laws of nature to explain, With erring reason for my guide: I spread your doctrines far and wide, I laugh'd to scorn creation's plan; And God, O height of human pride! Arraign'd before the bar of man. I flew, to quiet my alarms, Where joy the sparkling goblet crown'd; And wine's intoxicating charms The cares of dull existence drown'd: I join'd in pleasure's madd'ning round, And though my heart consum'd the while, Beneath a rankling, torturing wound, My features wore a ghastly smile! How chang'd the scene,âyon glorious sun, That gilds creation with his rays, Grew dark to me,â'twas mine to shun His early rising, noon-tide blaze: I sought the wood's untrodden ways, And pac'd, with melanchloy tread, The church-yard's solitary ways, To hold communion with the dead. Hark! 'twas a whisper from the tomb:â âWhy, suff'rer, wilt thou ling'ring stay? Doth parent earth deny thee room, Now all thy joys are pass'd away? Grief, disappointment, doubt, dismay, Unhallow'd love, and rage severe, Disturb'd us thro' life's feverish day, But cannot break our slumber here.â I've seen in heav'nly visions bright Those seats where blessed spirits dwell; Eternal fields of living light, Such as no mortal tongue may tell; And in the lowest depths of hell I've listen'd to the hideous scream Of angels who did once rebelâ And started from the fearful dream! Will peace ne'er charm my breast again? I frantic criedâand breath'd a pray'r, When darting swift across my brain Distraction cameâthe fiend was there! Then loud, in agony, despair, I ask'd of pitying heav'n to die; And frenzied, with my bosom bare, Defied the bolt that thunder'd by. I've thought that in a brittle bark They bore me o'er the boundless deep, And plac'd me as misfortune's mark On some lone shore, or rocky steep, Where I have sat me down to weep, While the loud billows foam'd below; Doom'd one eternal watch to keep, An immortality of woe. Would that the soul might sleep in dust, And with her mortal part expireâ What! shall th' Eternal prove unjust? Vain, selfish, impotent desire! For me suspend his dreadful ire? For me his sword of vengeance sheathe? My heart is wrung, my brain's on fire, Hell opens, and I sink beneath! Att. Be calm, for 'tis thy hour of death, The conflict sad will soon be o'erâ Be calm, nor spend thy lab'ring breath In ravings wildâa little more, And thou shalt reach that unknown shoreâ Seek Him whose pow'r alone can saveâ Yes, while thou canst, thy sin deplore: There's no repentance in the grave. O listen to the Saviour's voiceâ âSon of adversity, draw near, And I will make thy heart rejoice, And I will wipe each falling tear. Art thou a penitent sincere? My promise, Sinner, sets thee free.â âThen humbly hope; thy title's clear; The great atonement was for thee. Pen. O Thou, before whose throne I kneel, Accept, though late, repentance deep: Remorse hath touch'd this heart of steel, These stubborn eyes have learn'd to weep. Cold death-like shiv'rings o'er me creep, Strange phantoms swim before my sight; One pang, and then the last, long sleep; But morn succeeds a moonless night! Bear me above, ye heav'nly choir, To where yon sounds celestial ring! Hark! 'tis an angel strikes the lyre, A sinner reconcil'd to sing! I mount on Hope's exulting wing, What floods of glory meet my eyes!âAtt. â'Tis past, and death hath lost his sting: The Soul hath reach'd her native skies. INSCRIPTION FOR AN ALBUM. Haste thee hither, Sisters three, Music, Painting, Poesy! Music, chauntress, that was born On creation's glorious morn, When the stars in choral hymn, And the sweet-voic'd cherubim, Sang the goodness and the might That from chaos call'd the light:â Painting, that is wont to trace Gentleness, expression, grace, And, with never-fading hue, Ev'ry flow'r that drinks the dew:â Poesy, companion meet, Making solitude more sweet, Rapt with some inspiring theme, Avon! by thy silver streamâ Each from her celestial sphere Deign awhile to linger here, And with various pow'rs combin'd, Charm the ear, the eye, the mind. TO A FLY. Busy, bustling, buzzing Fly, Which is happiest, you or I? Ever roving, like the bee, Is the merry lark more free When to heav'n he soars and sings, While the vocal woodland rings, Answering from each dewy thorn His sweet welcome to the morn? Constant to the wedded state, He marries in a hedge his mateâ Who shall count the num'rous fair Of thy harems in the air? He the Strephon of a bough, Of ev'ry room the Juan thou! Little costs your slender meal, All you eat and drink you steal! Banqueting on ev'ry dish Gratis, whether fowl or fish. Round my nectar'd goblet's brim Slow you creep with cautious limb, Fearing lest your little feet Get entangled with the sweet! Round my nose on rapid wing First you buzz, and then you sting! Then to Celia's cheek repair, Seek a soft asylum there, In her auburn tresses skip, Taste the nectar of her lip, Bask in the sunshine of her eye, With all th' effront'ry of a Fly!â Which is happiest, you or I? Child of liberty and sport, Who shall say thy time is short? Short indeed thy transient span To the droning life of man; Yet each minute is an age In thy hist'ry's tiny page! Spring's delightful verdant shoots, Summer's blossoms, Autumn's fruits, Fair and glorious to the eye, Have no longer date, but die. May no urchin, imp of sin! E'er transfix thee with a pin; Spider in his web enthrall, And wrap thee in a filmy pall; Poison in thy cup be found, Or thou in pleasure's draught be drown'd. With the Autumn's roseate hours, With the sunshine and the flow'rs, Sportive creature of a day, Unmolested pass away. ON REVISITING MY FATHER'S GRAVE. Are tears forbid?âThe torrent pour'd Down sorrow's cheek for virtue's doom, Is surely not by heav'n abhorr'dâ 'Tis soothing to the spirit's gloomâ David his Absalom deplor'd, And Jesus wept at Lazarus' tomb! Yes, there's a holy balm in tears That heals the heart as soon as shed; Heav'n to a spot unseen for years In mercy hath my footsteps led; How calm the solitude appears, How sweet the mem'ry of the dead. My Sire, ere winter's chilling frost Thy debt was paidâthe last and leastâ The day I mourn'd a Father lost, Was I enthrall'd, and thou releas'd; Thou safe in port, I tempest-toss'dâ My cares begun, ere childhood ceas'd. And how I plough'd the dang'rous sea (My bark untravell'd o'er the deep,) Is only known to Heav'nâand thee, If guardian angels vigils keep (Immortal spirits bless'd and free,) O'er those they lov'd and left to weep. And her who lov'd and mourn'd thee best, In rev'rend age we weeping bear, (Long parted) to thy place of restâ Her hope,âfaith, suff'ring, patience, pray'râ Age, spare my brow (a wearied guest) Nor plant thy snows and wrinkles there. The palsied frame, the hoary head, The heart grown selfish, cold, and sear, More terrors than thy grassy bed Strike to my soul, lov'd spot! for here My hop'd-for rest, were breath'd and shed My latest sigh, my earliest tear. MONODY ON THE DEATH OF SIR WALTER SCOTT, BART. In Dryburgh's deep romantic shade, And ruins gray, with ivy crown'd, A magic harp and wand are laidâ The minstrel sleeps his sleep profound: Hush'd is the music of the glade, The wand is broke, the spell unbound. Ye stately turrets! arches dim! Mourn not your ancient glories pass'd, Though vocal once to choral hymn, Now to the moanings of the blast! Ye are become the shrine of him, The noblest Druid, and the last. Wit in her robe of fiction dress'd, And fancy in her highest mood, All that a blessing are, and bless'dâ The wise, the generous, and the good, Shall each repairâa welcome guest, As pilgrims to thy solitude. And call it not an idle dream, That fairy footsteps print the ground By lonely glen, and wizard stream; That harps unseen a requiem sound, And spirits by the moon's pale beam, Their watchful vigils keep around; That mountain, woodland, valley green, To the hoarse breeze responsive sigh; And soft and gentle dews at e'en Weep to behold the poet die; And Scotia, genius of the scene, Joins the lament, the funeral cry. For he was cradled in her arms,â She nurs'd and rear'd the wondrous child; Her rugged, stern, romantic charms, Her tales of yore, and legends wild, And deeds of chivalry and arms, In youth's gay morn his hours beguil'd. And as he trod the heather bloom, By desert cave, or mountain-steep, Some holy altar, banner'd tomb, Or battled tower, or donjon-keep,â A martyr's fate, a warrior's doom, Have bade the pilgrim pause to weep. And then he struck the ready lyre, And sung the minstrel's parting lay; And rapt with inspiration higher, The feuds of Flodden's fatal day; And bade with undiminish'd fire The Knight of Snowdoun live for aye. By guilt, despair, and madness driv'n, A spirit rose at his commandâ A fiend from hell, a saint from heav'n,â And sparkling wit, and humour bland, And patriot love, to him were giv'n, For thee, fair Scotia, native land! His heart, inflexible and true, Shone brightest in affliction's hour; Though gentle as the morning dew, That gems with silver drops the flower; Heaven spares not the immortal few, The tempest shakes the loftiest tower. Yet not alone does Scotia mourn Her noblest son who sleeps beneath: Assembled nations round his urn The laurel with the cypress wreathe; Where arctics freeze, and tropics burn, A tear shall drop, a sigh shall breathe. And woe is me! for I have seen The glorious pile his genius rear'd; The hall antique, superbly sheen! The social hearth his presence cheer'd, The classic bow'r, poetic scene, His virtue, wisdom, wit endear'd. Have mark'd his eye with dewy lid A tear distil, a smile unfold; Have heard his voice, that welcome bid In token of remembrance old, Or long delay, or absence chidâ And press'd his hand that now is cold. Not mine to build the lofty verseâ Yet had I left the song unsung, (Garland unmeet for such a hearse! Or lay for such a tuneful tongue!) Of deep ingratitude the curse, My harp had broke, my lyre unstrung. Ye ruin'd altars! shrines o'erthrown By sacrilegious hands of old, Now shapeless heaps of crumbling stoneâ That sacred dust, that hallow'd mould Shall make ye still a mark, and known, When thrones have wan'd, and ages roll'd.</field>
