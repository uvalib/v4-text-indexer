      <field name="fulltext">POEMS AND SONNETS âThe rapture of pursuing Is the prize the vanquished gain.ââLongfellow. PART I. DEDICATION. SAND AND THE BAYS. I She crowned my hair with sand; I wonder will She ever twine her hand amid the bays, And ever render unto me the praise Without which all men's praise, alas, is nil, But which is potent by itself to fill To the full the flowing current of my days: Was it an omen for my future lays, An evil omen, that she chose to spill, And twine amid my locks a sandy wreath? Have I, in fact, as Keats in humble thought Deemed that in water he his name had wrought, To shifting sand of poetry made bequeath; And will the foamy, white, advancing teeth Of Time bring both myself and mine to nought? II Will she be favourable? she, who crowned with sand My head, too happy to be touched at all By what her hand had touched to care to call Out, âStay, sweet, choose a less ill-omened band Wherewith to bind my brow.â I seem to stand Before her, yea, before my Queen alone, And into nothingness the world is thrown For the time, and only two possess the land; I offer her my book; I think that she Will smile to recognize a flower or two We plucked together, set in frame-work new, And many buds and blossoms she will see Unseen before, and leaflets not a few, And will she, think you, cast a glance on me? LOVE. A SERIES OF SONNETS. PSYCHE AND MERCURY, ONE OF RAPHAEL'S FRESCOES. A face that, as it seems to me, combines All beauties of expression into one! As shines upon the sea the summer sun, With rippling laughter it for ever shines; Gaze only with intensity, the lines Will shift themselves before you; I could swear I've seen it move as I was standing there, And look to me and speak to me by signs; And then the wonder of the black-brown hair, And gleaming glory of the green-grey eyes! I never see the picture, I declare, Without a gasp of sorrow and surprise, Surprise that I have found a face so fair, Sorrow that 'tis not mine in anywise. THE SONG OF THE BLIND POET. It sootheth me on love's delights to linger, They're true for some one else, if not for me, I cannot sing in any other key, At least, I'll point them out with passionate finger, A voice, an unseen sound, a sightless singer, I'll teach them what to take and what to flee, A Finger-Post, a Light-House in the sea, Of joy to all men but myself a bringer; There was a world of wonder and of daytime, I found it, men that live will find it, fair, For them will gleam the greenery of Maytime, And laughter leave an echo in the air, For them the hours of work and pleasant playtime, For me the inactive deeps of dull despair. BLOWN BUBBLES. I may not see you, love, but I will greet you With sweet blown bubbles, kisses of my rhymes: Sleepless, my thoughts shall wander forth to meet youâ At odorous hours of dusk, at evening-times, A vesper-song, a fairy peal of chimes, Borne in upon your hearing they shall reach you, Take form, and falling at your feet beseech you To breathe a prayer for a lover in lonely climes; I would, my love, that fancy's troop of kisses Might fall upon you like a gentle dew, A shower of shaken rose-petals, or a crew Of elves to pelt you with bewildering blisses And cowslip-balls, beneath sweet warm abysses Of hay to smother you, as we used to do In the hot hazy afternoons in hay-fields, Hours of delight in childhood's pleasant play-fields, Happy, amidst the green, beneath the blue. THE ECSTACY OF THE HAIR. I'd send a troop of kisses to entangle And lose themselves in labyrinths of hair, Thy deep dark night of hair with stars to spangle, And, each a tiny fire-fly, to dangle Amid the tresses of that forest fair; A perfume seems to blossom into air, The ecstacy that hangs about the tresses, Their blush, their overflow, their breath, their bloom, A wind that gently lifts them, and caresses, And wings itself, and floats about the room; My meaning this but partially expresses, The thoughts that in me smoulder and consume, I want to say that to my mind the hair So wonderfully, wildly, sweetly fair Seems, that a fancy all my soul possesses Its ecstacy ought to blossom into perfume. SPRING. I As some sweet rosebud opens and discloses A widening wealth of beauty to the view, As every day in spring the wild-flower posies Increase in number, scent, and warmth of hue, As pale pink rosebuds redden into roses, And faint gray larkspur freshens into blue, As every morn the great sun-artist rises And paints afresh high heaven's fiery floor With streaks, and lights, and tints, and new surprises, And waves of colour all unknown before, Bewildering the air with shapes and sizes Of clouds its shining surface sprinkled o'er, So day by day your beauty, my delight, omes clearer, fuller, fresher into sight. II As every wave a broken wave that follows Flings a fresh flower of foam upon the shore, As year by year the home-returning swallows Seem sweet to us as though ne'er seen before, As greenery of spring on hills, in hollows, Seems each new spring-time greener than of yore, As every morn the ether seems to lighten With one great blue broad smile from side to side, As snows are white, and holly-berries brighten With ruddier redness at each Christmas-tide, And flowers are fair, and orange-blossoms heighten Their loveliness for each new blushing bride, So love your beauty every morning light Blossoms into some new nosegay of delight. IN SPITE OF ME. O love, my love, I love you more than ever, I prithee tell me, what am I to do? With some faint, feeble shadow of endeavour At times I try the bonds of love to sever, But stronger than before they close anew, I could not, if I would, become untrue, I feel as if before I'd loved you never For every day your beauty into view Comes clearer; as the great gold sun-ship rises, A vessel fraught with ever-fresh surprises, So daily beams upon me some sweet vision Entangling in its train some new condition; In fine, I find that still as life grows longer In spite of me my love becometh stronger! KING LOVE. I Out of the depths of loneliness I cry, A voice to awake the echoes of the past, A voice that rises, borne upon the blast, And seeks the shadowy land for which I sigh, A land I long to visit ere I die, Where, throned in isles of green and bowers of roses, Himself a red rose, revels and reposes King Love, all bathed about with seas of posies And scent of honeysuckle hanging nigh; There skies are blue and breath of gentle breezes Gladdens a land that smiles from side to side, Smiling a smile the enraptured soul that seizes And whirls adown its own soft-flowing tide, A land of purple seas, of day that pleases And night that soothes, a starry dark-eyed bride. II Nor only dwells the King in bowers of roses Amid the growth and greenery of the land, Across the seas and barren breadths of sand His voice is heard, the mountain-height discloses His form enshrined where ignorance supposes The cold white Snow-Queen lords it all alone, Shaking the snow-showers round her misty throne, And all her force to melting love opposes; Warm Love that melts the very rocks in sunder, And crumbles mountains into sheets of sea, Brave Love that steals the bolts of Monarch Thunder, And, when the Monarch mutters, laughs in glee, True Love, the King of Wisdom and of Wonder, White, born of woman, fiery-footed, free. III Along the hills and heights and purple highlands, Adown the valleys, lo! Love sweeps his wand, The spring breathes blossoms born at his command. The streams, the lakes, the seas, the wreath of islands, The sunset-splendour of the western skylands, All borrow bloom and beauty from his touch, He holds the Round World crumpled in his clutch, The suns and moons, the starry far and nigh lands; Love interpenetrates the silent spaces, Therein his wings awake a wave of sound, With Sound and Light King Love runs laughing races And beats them breathless, beats them at a bound, Above, beneath the earth, yea, in all places Some shimmer of his presence may be found. A KISS FOR EVER. Two lovers were found, slain by lightning. And it seemed as if, when the lightning slew them, they were in the act of kissing one another. The accounts of this occurrence were given in the daily papers at the time. I They stood beneath the roses in the laneâ The honeysuckle breathed upon the pair, The roses shed their petals in her hair And blushed for joyâtwo lives without a stain, With pleasure pale and passing into pain Were hand in hand together, and the air About them both a perfume seemed to bear, A misty veil that closed around the twain And hid them from the world: her gentle breath Rises and falls and lightly fans his face, The after-sunset silence of the place Broods o'er them sleepily, as still as death, Save only when from time to time he saith Low words, her rosy lips soft whispers grace. II A little while, and then the first-born kiss, Long, lovingly and lingeringly taken, By one who feels the whole wide world of bliss For him that rosebud cup contains; a shaken Wild rosebush sprinkles them with drops of dew, Pure, pearly, dripped from off the leafy fingersâ They nestle in her hair and trickle throughâ All save one larger loitering pearl that lingers Crowning the fair white circle of her brow In sign that she too reigns henceforth a queen, A queen among the pure; the branches bow, And eyes of love the sprays and flowers atween Seem softly to peep out upon a pair Together soon the life of death to share. III For, from on high, the Lord of Love looked down On man and maid, and saw that these were pure, And, pleased, prepared right royally to crown Their lips with a white kiss that should endure, The kiss for which fair lovers have been sighing Through all the ages that have passed away, A kiss to last for ever, never flying Through all the hours of Eternal Day; And this they won; Love sent his servant Lightning To seal for ever their one lovers' kiss, And bear them gently, softly, without frightening, To spend their honeymoon in brighter bliss, Among the lanes where faithful lovers walk In heaven, to renew that evening's broken talk. ANNE HATHAWAY. Completion of the unfinished sonnet attributed to Shakespeare, beginning âAnne Hathaway, she hath a way.â âAnne Hathaway, she hath a way,â I wonder What way it was that won the singer's soul, Could lips that pout, and part, and smile asunder, Heart of a Shakespeare conquer and control, Or had some traitor tress âa way of wavingâ In windy jubilance across her eyesâ A way it was, I doubt not, worth the saving In some soft sonnet proud of such a prize, Only, unluckily, the words were broken Short off, you see, by some such âwoman's way,â For, soon as Shakespeare's lips the above had spoken, So sound an illustration I should say Of what he meant was given in a kiss That he was well content the rest to miss. REMINISCENCE. Standing upon the cliff where I remember That autumn eve the maiden musing stood, Enwrapped around with twilight of September, Pondering soft things in some soft maiden mood, Fanning a fresh flame out of memory's ember Over the past and âis to beâ I brood; I joy to see that signs are all around me Of her sweet presence who before was there, An echo of her loveliness has found me Breathed forth from all the crowd of flowers fair That, smiling upwards, silently surround me, Filling the places that before were bare; A perfume of her presence seems to hover In ecstasy about the holy place, Entanglements of trefoil and of clover In soft solicitude my feet embrace, The special spots her feet have trodden over By blossom-clusters special sweet I trace, And, resting in the midst of flowers fair Feel in some sort as if their queen was there. A FLOWER. A fair white flower, gathered all alone, Before me sighs, and bends a lowly head; Instinct with life she seems, as if she shed Tears for the sake of soft companions flown, As if she musically made a moan (Just as a maiden though she smile or weep Her soul in beauty cannot fail to steep) After her loved ones into sorrow thrown; 'Tis wet to-night, and all the cliffs are raining, And heavy hang the beaded blades of grass, And I can fancy pale white faces straining, Pale flower faces, tearful with complaining, After my captive planted in a glassâ Herself, it seems, a sorrow far from feigning. SACRA NOX. O Night divine, bringer of dreams to mortals, What should we do without thee? when the day Like some slow snake has dragged its length away, With gentle hand thou closest eyelid portals, And, fact shut out, sweet fiction works within, And many a form to Beauty's Queen akin Sweeps through the sleeper's brain, the weary din Of daylight all forgotten, bliss that foretells Reality of waking bliss to be, Casting across the forehead of the sleeper Soft lights and shades, as over summer sea Flit clouds of colour, ever waxing deeper As laughs by night a soul in light a weeper Uprising strong the moon of ecstasy. TO A YELLOW ROSE. O flower of flowers, fit for Beauty's breast, To rise and fall upon a bosom fair, Or sink in silent ecstasy and rest Deep down amid the hollows of her hair, Sweet places winged with odours all divine, Soft nests wherein I long to twine my hands, Whence beauty, queen of roses, bright as thine Buds, blossoms, and at last in air expands; For I have always felt the wealth of tresses, Of certain deep dark tresses I have seen, No wreath of rhymes, no written word expressesâ I approach the nearest to the thing I mean, When I say that to my mind this wondrous hair Seemeth to blossom into scent as fair. ONCE! I When we grow old shall we forget, I wonder, The bloom and delicate odour of our youth? Will years that are to be divide in sunder The achieved and the as yet unconquered truth? Will cheeks all pale with eld and worn and shrunken Remember the sweet flush that once they wore, And limbs that totter, as a man reels drunken, Be mindful of the weight that once they wore So lightly? Sad to me the thought of growing Towards the withering withered autumn time, For autumn roses lose the art of blowing, The only true rose is the rose of prime, And what a rose is that, the rose of youth, No words of poet compass all its truth! II If this be so, my brothers, let us sing, Yea, let us raise our voices while we can, And join our numbers to the birds of spring; Our life is short, for but a little span We see the sunshine, then we face the winter, And though we shiver, we in our sore need, Never, although we blow it till it splinter, Will music echo from a wintry reed; But something is it but once to have spoken, And wrung from out our hearts a broken cry, A cry towards Beautyâto have given token Once how we love her, once before we die, And if we can but die upon her breast Breathing her loveliness we may find rest. III Something it is to have found in some slight measure A voice, a gift of speech, before we die, Yea, should we die now yet we've had the pleasure Of breathing out our souls in one long sigh Towards the lips of Beauty; this, my brothers, While life abides in veins of ours we do, As timid children cry for absent mothers, We cry for her, we know that she is true; Though all else fail us Beauty has been; never Can we forget the vision we have seen, Weak as a babe is Death's arm bonds to sever, He cannot change a kiss that once has been, He cannot move its image from the lips Though thrice in his cold stream a soul he dips. IV Therefore we triumphâeven in our sorrowâ For if we vanish Beauty yet abides, And if our song is blotted out to-morrow Our Queen for ever through the planet rides, Yea, if our name be not rememberÃ¨d And no man mourn us, She it may be bears In memory these singers who are dead, Their vainly sought for crowns she wins and wears; And so it should be; let us raise our voices And beat upon our hearts till each one rings, What matters agony if she rejoices, Or loss of self, if only some one sings, What matters anything if she our Queen Lives on, and her sweet face our eyes have seen? V What we have seen no soul can take away, What we have known, is open to no hand To rob us of, we too have had our day And sailed the seas, and traversed lengths of land In search of satisfaction, and our sorrow Is when we fear the Beauty of the Whole Is not as we would have itâbut we borrow In some sort consolation for our soul By falling back upon the fact that certain It is that eyes of ours have Beauty seen, If o'er her form has fallen again the curtain 'Tis none the less true that she once has been, That we with our eyes, yea, these eyes of ours, Have seen her home and fairyland of flowers. VI What has been may be yet againâfor others At all events, if for ourselves no more; We pass the wonder on towards our brothers Who have wandered further forward on the shore Of Man's Development; let these men find her, And raise their voices loud, and sing her fame, But let us know to whom we have resigned her, Our Goddessâif they are worthy of her name; Let these, the poets of the future, finish The work we have tried, and trying, left undone; By not a jot their fame would we diminish, By not a ray the splendour of their sun, Only let some one say the things we see, And these things see with clearer sight than we. DON'T. Don'tâah, but, sweet, I willâyou must not mind it, My turn at last it is to have my will, If I should kiss my treasure till I blind it Closed eyes of hers I'd go on kissing still; A poor wild singer am I, and a singer In love is not, you know, like other men, They kiss their mistress' hand, I kiss each finger, Then think I've miss'd one out and count again; Let these make odes, as is their bounden duty, To love, and seal their songs with finger tips, But as for me when I am praising Beauty My signature is always with the lips Just so, sweetâlet me kiss the place again, Believe me it will heal the sooner then. THE BAY-LEAF CROWN. I And is it yet in front in spite of all? That crown my eyes are hungry to embrace, And will my head be ever fitting place On which its circular shadow soft may fall? If this be so, I am strong to burst the thrall Of every low desire that backward bears A soul that should be wingÃ¨d as the airs, That downward drags a heart that should be tall As a majestic oak, and as the sea In width, and as the diamond air above In depth, intensity, and warmth of love Towards all the living things that 'neath it be, And long as woman's memory, and as free And gentle as the flying of a dove. II Far, far in front they glitter, those sweet leaves, But many a lonesome agony lies between, And many a desert all untouched by green, And many a day that mocks, and night that grieves, And many a harvest all bereft of sheaves, Bereft of fruit to gatherâbut the prize Is worthyâin the future far it lies, And distance of its sorrow hope bereaves; But pain is pain, and bitter are the tears We shed, the wreaths of weeping we entwine, Sad cypress wreaths made bright with eglantine, Around the cherished hopes of vanished years, Around our earlier loves, their low-laid biers, Their ghosts proceeding in a pale long line. ISOLINA. I O all fair women of my boyish days With whom I fell in love in sweet rotation, I bow my head in humble obligation, And lift my voice, and loudly sing your praise; There was an âIsolineâ whose memory stays Yet with me, and âDie Vernon,â I remember How heartily to her I did surrender My soul, my reverent open-eyed amaze At that most fascinating dame; and others A countless host of many coloured eyes Whose glances now, alas! forgetfulness smothers, But which once thrilled me throughly with surprise, And unto thoughts that tender youth supplies, All high romantic thoughts, were foster-mothers. II But, chiefest of them all, sweet Isolina The heroine of the âWar-Trailâ doth remain In mind of mine, and even now the pain And mingled pleasure of her high demeanour In that most perilous time in which I'd seen her My memory is potent to retain, And her fierce beauty as of dark-eyed Spain Is present with me; when a boy to screen her From those wild Indians what would I have done, To have been the happy man who brought her back, A kiss of Isolina's to have won, To have followed furiously the White Horse track? Why, I was all the time upon the rack, I felt upon my lids the fervent sun III Of Mexico, and through the shadowy waste Of mezquite bushes and the flowery plains I followed hard the trail with loosened reins And made pursuit of her in hottest haste, All tremulous lest half a tress displaced By rougher hands might bring to nought our pains; An echo of the agony yet remains, A vision of the speed with which we raced Across these burning prairies, and a throb, Yea, even now a throb of that long kiss With which we welcomed back to arms of bliss, Inviolate, her that fate had tried to rob Us of; pure ecstasy indeed was this, The ecstasy that endeth in a sob, IV Too sweet to tarry dry-eyed; good old tale, I thank thee for the pleasure thou hast given To hours of boyhood, in that I have striven Over thy pages, heart a-beat and pale, To one at least thou hast been of avail, And of reality his mind hast shriven For a time, asunder robe of daylight riven, And filled Imagination's swelling sail With breezes of romance; farewell my Queen, My early dark-eyed face-flushed Queen of Hearts, Tanned with the passion of those Southern parts! Alas! full many a year has rolled between Thee and thy boyish knight, and sting of darts Of Love far fiercer since his soul has seen. ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON. I saw a couple courtingâand her face Was beautiful, and she was half afraid, And he, the stronger, rather roughly played With fears of hers, and caught in his embrace Her form eluding him with lissom grace, And clasped again the waist that forward swayed; And so they toyed together, man and maid, And filled with sunny love the quiet place Where they were seated; and I looked and thought, âShe is seated on love's ladderâit is true, Her love, but much remaineth yet to do Before love's hand the flower of love has wrought, And to the ladder's summit she is brought, Proceeding rung by rung the stages through!â II But most I marked that strange consenting âNayâ Of womanhood, at once her choicest gift, The power by which God meant her high to lift Our manhood, the sweet power of giving way, And chiefest peril; many a weary day Will pass before we learn to reverence Those lips of hers that bid a man âgo henceâ While all the time they whisper âSweetheart stayâ By something than mere words more potent farâ Before we learn to reverence the yielding, And meet it on our side by courtly shielding Of woman from her own malignant star, Not caring that her very grace should mar Beauty that otherwise she should be wielding. III It is so beautiful, that readiness To yield herself unquestioning, so fair, That doubled twenty times should be the care With which we harder men ourselves address To the task of coaxing forth the coy caress That woos us as a blossom woos the air, Half fearful yet half eagerâit is there, But grasp it rudely, it is there the less. Experiments in love for all the ages We have been making, and we see our way At last to somewhat of a clearer day, To the fresh unfolding of some final pages Of Love's portfolio; its final sway In utmost Beauty God himself engages; IV In utmost Beauty, Purity as wellâ Twin sisters these, they traverse hand in hand The lengthy avenues of Love's long land, And great as is the fall from heaven to hell The loss is if a man would either quell To worship one alone; the latter wears A white rose in her bosom, and she bears, Her sister, set upon her lips to tell Her fragrance unto each she deigns to kiss, A red roseâin the future we shall know That Beauty hath a breast as white as snow, That lips of Purity with passionate bliss Are rosy as her sister's, and that this, This combination, hath the sunset glow, V The fire of the scarlet evening air, All its intensity made more intense By dazzling clearness free from all offence, And not made colourless, but made more fair, More beautiful, more passionately rare By the white rose petals; more to be desired Than kisses of a cheek by passion fired Is such a sweet unbinding of the hair Of Beauty; in that kiss and here alone King Passion hath his rights and Beauty too, For otherwise she maketh much ado, Queen Beauty, roughly hurled from off her throne And crushed beneath his gauntlet; but a few Have both the Monarch and his Lady known, VI And found them fair, she soft as eventide, He burly with the blushes of the noon, For ever humming forth some lusty tune, Ready to kiss her if she only sighed, Sheâone with whom it would be sweet to ride Beneath an early rising of the moon, Or listen to the ripple all in tune The March Triumphant of a flowing tide; But let us grasp the hands of King and Queen, And be with her on silent summer eves, And run a race with Passion 'mid the sheaves, The golden sheaves of Autumn in between At molten noonday, yea, and after, glean With her the ears that he the reckless leaves. MY OWN DART. I love Love, therefore am I far apart From Loveâbecause she's everything to me The less am I allowed her face to see, The less am able to outpour my heart, Permitted less to ease its aching smart And low to fall and say, âI worship thee;â If I loved less the fates would gracious be, But loving much transfixed by mine own dart Of over great anxiety I die; I cannot get to clutch the thing I would, If it were possibleâah! if I could Attain to it, extended in a sigh My being, all of it, would prostrate lie, Fainting for joy at such a gainÃ¨d good! POETRY. I love it, but I cannot find a voice, I cannot bead my thoughts upon the strings Of that soft lyre wherewith the Goddess sings, I cannot sorrow rightly, nor rejoice Arightâher garment over me she flings; I love Love, but I cannot reach her hair, Though lips of mine are burning with desire With kisses to enkindle in a fire What I, caressing once, once found so fairâ No striving of the spirit brings me nigher. MISS THACKERAY'S âREINE.â I Thank Heaven! that there still are left a few Right noble women who know how to feelâ If there are none in fact, why let them steal Possession of our hearts, the heroic crew Who in the fictions which alone are true Alone give unto mankind cause to kneel In adorationâlet the novelists heal The age, providing us with Passion new; If women whom we daily see around Are white and feeble, most unreal dames, For God's sake let us bury knightly aims Along with knightly stories underground, And when they seek us, let us still be found Insensible to any but the claims II Of storied damselsâsuch as noble Reine Who set my heart a-scribbling in this fashion I wonder whether such a wealth of passion, Save only in recesses of the brain Of genius, on earth doth yet remain, Whether a woman fit to tie the shoe Of Reine of Petitport is ever true, Or only fancied in the painted pane Of High Imagination; but since one, One worthy woman, only think my brothers, Has struggled into life, we'll hope for others, Yea, for a reign of Goddesshood begun, That the Romances that have such a run May unto passionate romance be mothers! ABSTRACT TO CONCRETE. I My Queen, I have not quite forgotten youâ Though abstract thoughts have occupied my pen Of late, I turn towards you now and then, And never fail to find refreshment new; As opens out a flower towards the blue When early morning chases shades of night, So when your beauty, sweet one, comes in sight I put aside the work I had to do And open out Imagination's arms To grasp the graceful image that I seeâ To grasp at all events the thought of thee. That of itself a mind perturbÃ¨d calms, And, exercising a magician's charms, Bids pale Philosophy take wings and flee. II Philosophy is paleâshe is a bride To some who rosier lips have never seen, Who never in the company have been, Have never trodden, silent, at the side Of Beauty; had they, they must have defied Another to assert herself as Queen; The Marble Goddess hath a countenance keen, And she is gentle, and her hands are wide In distribution, butâone day I saw, I caught a glimpse, high seated in a wood, Of Beauty, and I tell you she is good, Fair as a rose, and free from any flaw, And in a moment, lo! I loved her more Than the other in a century any could. LOVE'S ORDEAL. SUGGESTED BY MR. MAC DONALD'S POEM. He felt the darknessâand he felt them fold Around him, arms of her who loved him so That she was certain Youth yet lay below The aged garment that she did behold Encircling him grown withered, wrinkled, oldâ That she was strong extremity to know, Yea, strong to cherish with her breast of snow His breast by this time earthy, clay-like, cold; Another way the story may be told For fades from arms of ours Queen Beauty's glow As frequently, and sore excess of woe Is over eyelids sick with longing rolled, Heavy with fainting for a sight of her Who has withdrawn the sunset of her face, And left in heaven not a single trace, No gold-tipped cloud to show that she was there, That but a moment since the sky was fair And crimson colour flooded every place. BLUE WEATHER. A beautiful blue day! I would that I Were pure as is to-day the cloudless sky, Transparent as the spotless autumn air, That unto Beauty I might be more nigh, Myself more like her, nobler and more fair And stronger; low before her feet to lie, Watching the downcast ripples of her hair The endless fire of her face, I sigh, Too happily placed to care to move or cry, Too happy even to pray or wonder why I am happy, only knowing that I share The nectar of the glances of her eye! THE WORLD. We are moved, it seems, by never changing law Towards the better, with the best in view In the distance; mist-enfolded mountains new, Strange valleys our forefathers never saw Gleam wonderfully before usâpassing o'er Each ridge another magically blue, Folded in mystery, cuts the horizon through, And with discovery's passion even more Unquenchably inspires us; so we wander Towards the future, careless of the past, Each age outflanking utterly the last, Working new miracles for us to ponder, While ever those sweet misty mountains yonder Entice the feet of Progress forward fast. A MEETING. I pray you kiss me once, my queen, to show That all the past is merged in present bliss, And kiss me twice to make more certain this, And once again to signify the flow The happy future undivided glow Of Love; make each kiss keener than the last To indicate the pallor of the past Compared with rosy days we two shall know; A kiss for present, future, past, for each Was good; the past was lit by expectation Striving across the waves of tribulation Unto the present arms of hope to reach, Sweet is the present, blessed beyond speech, Sweeter each future than the former station. THE GOVERNESS. Have you been lonely, darling? So have I, And weary, oh! so sick and sad at timesâ I used to hum the old familiar rhymes That we, do you remember, used to try Upon the pianoforte on the slyâ Delight ecstatic of those youthful crimes! Most marvellous melody of those drawing-room chimes Sometimes in the morning no one else being by! So sorrowfully they came back to me Laden with fragrance of the vanished pastâ I thought at the time it was too good to last, That such excessive happiness must flee, And so it did, but now hath followed fast A far more radiant reality. GLANCES. I Some of those looks I never shall forget, Some of those looks you gave me long ago; To you at all events, I own, I owe Remembrance sweeter even than regret; When I recall your eyes my eyes are wet, You used to glance at me sometimes just soâ Just so it wasâah! you would hardly know, But I remember how the lightnings metâ The sudden mutual flashing of the eyes When one struck strongly on a common chord That used the other's action to applaud; Though unto height of threescore years I rise And every other pleasure life denies I have that recollection for reward, II Reward of having lived and sorrowed much And sinned and suffered; why it was worth while Creating one to get but one such smile, To feel the passionate fervour of a touch Of hands that used to send an electric shock That shivered into pieces the rent rock Of my poor heart in most emphatic style; If now my life is desert, yet an isle, A green oasis, blossoms in the past, And worth the agony of all the rest It is with one such vision to be blessed, By one such memory to be followed fast, To have one radiant recollection cast Across the raging waters sore-distressed III Of present sad existence, to have known At least in dreams how wonderful is Love When Beauty, girded sweetly, sits above, The occupant of some soft grassy throne, How rapturous a thing it is to own Yourself defeated, over head and ears Immersed in Passion's sea of smiles and tears, When some one else's heart is there to moan The music of response; at least I say That Love is Beautiful, that Love is Fair, And rosy is the circling of the air Around the heads of lovers in the way; If now in loveless paths my footsteps stray Yet once for me the paths perfumed were. DELL' INFERNO. I O sea of all the sorrow of the earth, Thou rollest wide gray-garmented sad waves Across a mute metropolis of graves, Thou takest from us, but dost not give birth To other than a melancholy mirthâ Who hath been salted in thy cruel caves To the end the scar of his remembrance saves And holdeth but of little passing worth The occasional gleams of a most sorry sun That striveth through the mists to beat a way, He knoweth that the evening will be gray, He knoweth that the sand of time will run No faster, though he shake the glass and pray Existence to give over and have done. II No fasterâthough he plead with piteous tearsâ For each shall struggle his allotted span, Enjoy and suffer, each as best he can, Performing a pale pilgrimage of years That slowly build a greatening pile of biers Above the hopes with which the youth began His fervent course, when first his chariot ran Triumphantly, not knowing aught of fears; The roses now have shed their summer leaves, The bloom is faded, shorn the strength of limb, The eye that flashed with brilliance once is dim, Droop heads of desolation sodden sheaves Over which hangs a cloudy sky that grieves The swallows who in low sad circuit swim. III Are these things true? Is Beauty not a fable Invented by the misty minds of men As seasoning for a supper now and then? Hath Goodness, think you, a foundation stable, And is there other than a flimsy cable Connecting us with lands beyond the sky Of which men babble when they come to die Because they find themselves no longer able For pleasure upon earth? Is God a dream, And harmony, the poet's crown of bays, And other crowns as well that all men praise That for a season satisfying seem? And is it merely a nervous self-wrought gleam That fire of Love that flashed upon the ways, IV And turned the very paving stones to gold? Then let us sink into our beds and sleep, Or cast ourselves upon the grass and weep Until another Deluge we behold The hideous beauty-lacking fields enfold Through which we cripples, shorn of deity, creep; What is there left for us but one long deep Draught of annihilation icy cold? For what we used to worship is away, And we ourselves are nowise worshipful, And we have lost the art the strings to pull That move aside the curtains of the day, And we have lost the knowledge how to prayâ Of misery's bitter herbs our hands are full; V The apples of our love have turned sour, We see no longer what of old we saw, Nor is the vision present any more Of Beauty holding in her hand the flower, The scent of which her grace was wont to shower Our poet's rainbow-coloured garments o'er; The voices of our souls are very sore For lack of singing, yea, for lack of power Lark-like to rise into the morning sky; No longer overhead the air is blue, Cold shafts of raindrops pierce us through and through Until we raise an exceeding bitter cry, And crouching forehead downward, wait to die For want of any living thing to do. VI Yet they were sweet, the old familiar days In which we trod firmfooted on the earth, When lips were resonant with frequent mirth, And mouths were moved with frequent lilt of lays, And hands were able thanksgiving to raise To Heaven; when we were strong and all went well, Our foot-soles ignorant as yet of hell, And eyes not shrivelled with the infernal blaze; The memory abideth; even here, Amid the scorching gloomy aisles of heat Wherein we wander, cool old shades are sweet, And in the pressing presence of a fear That giveth us no rest we still hold dear Earth's grasses grateful to uncovered feet; VII We still remember pleasant hours of noon In summer, and the happy river-sides Where ripple unceasing after ripple glides, The tender radiance of the August moon That breatheth down a sweet delirious swoon Of ecstasy, and eloquence provides For lovers sailing down the abundant tides That move the boat of Passion to a tune Of fairy-fingered music; we are glad, With feet enshrined upon the fiery bars Of agony that every feature mars, To recollect that even we have had, We sorrowfullest sinners, we who are sad, A sight of some sweet clusters of the stars VIII Of Love's innumerable constellations; These lips once quivered at a maiden's kiss, That now must tremble at the tyrant hiss, The steam-engine approach, of hostile nations Of gad-flies of remorse that take their stations Upon the neck and shoulders of a man Bare for the torment, where each stinger can, Each to pursue his noisome occupations; Once we were free from theseâfree as a child Who having wandered from his mother's arms Plucks flower and flower, ignorant of harms In any, till with voice and gesture mild She calls him back, and soon his eyes have smiled Themselves to sleep forgetful of alarms. KATE AT THE WINDOW, âGRIFFITH GAUNT.â A most sweet picture! Kateâthe fireâthe moonâ The ivy-treeâwith Griffith Gaunt below, All softened by the tender light of snow, And set by Love to a dim delicious tune That swelled into a stronger symphony soon, Into a fiercer more ecstatic glowâ Such painting we have not been let to know Of late; the age is waking from the swoon Of artificiality that since The great wide human grand Shakespearian time Has given us jingles for melodious rhyme And made poor nature's delicate features wince; Approach us, rouse us, keen-eyed Fairy Prince, And kiss us out of centuries of crime. WHAT THE SONNET NEEDS. âTo write a Sonnet is an easy thing,â Says somebody, âthere are but fourteen linesâ Once get the knack that word with word combines And you will soon be qualified to sing, And o'er your shoulders rightfully may fling The mantle of a poet.â I say, No; To write a Sonnet first through fire and snow Your heart must pass due melody to bring From out the inert mass; some lady fair You have to love with a half hopeless pain, (This serves to give the âyearningâ of the strain), While now and then a glimmer of her hair Waved in the distance, serveth back to bear The power of soaring high in song again. A VISION. I have a vision of a lady bending Over a wounded warrior clad in mail, Blood-stained, sore smitten, weak and very paleâ A vision of sweet delicate fingers tending His feebleness, a fair physician sending Throughout his veins a draught that doth avail: And ever and anon I see her fail And faint half backward, woman's courage ending For a season; then he smilethâsuch a smile! Great eyes of fire glowing back within The head encased in panoply of tin, A smile as of a child not knowing guile; For she hath pitied him who mocked him while Unwounded, which is worth a death to win. CROWNS. There are many crowns; the poet's wreath of bays, The warrior's laurel and the monarch's gold, The twisted sweet rose garlands that enfold The brow of Beautyâthey were wont to praise In Greece the parsley and the oaken sprays And the grey sad wild olive we are told, But if I had my choice I'd choose to hold As a reward for any tuneful lays I may have had the grace to singâa wreathâ A wreath of woven ferns and meadows-sweetâ And if you ask me why, I will not sayâ But such a simple crown for me is meet, And memories lurk therein with golden feet Bringing back one unforgotten summer day. THE POET'S CROWN. Ah! they may sneer, the men who do not know The glory of the things the poet sees, Who feel no magic in a western breeze, Who see no marvel in a sheet of snow, No mystery-mountains in the sunset glow, Who hear no lisp of voices in the trees, Who sit and sip their port and take their ease, Not feeling either ecstasy or woe Of any exalted attitudeâbut I Would rather wear the crown the poet wins Than any other underneath the skyâ Save only that, the sweetest gift of all, Which on a favoured lover letteth fall His mistress by a sparkle of her eye. DEATH'S LIPS AND PALMS. There are two crowns I covet most of allâ One that the fair white brows of poets wear, That singers only have the right to share, The other that a woman's grace lets fall Upon the head of him she wills to call Her knight, and whom she singleth out to bear Her banner; but as yet alas! my hair Is neither shadowed by a laurel pall, Nor have my lips been crowned with Love's long kiss; I wait for bothâI wait the most for this; I waitâand it may be that no warm grasp May round my living brow the former clasp, That I may never know the latter bliss, Till lips and brow Death's lips and rough hands rasp. LOVES. Loves vary; one is like a summer night Just after rainfall, rich with fragrant dews, Another Love is like a shy recluse Who shuns the glaring openness of light And folds his happiness from public sight Wandering the woods at eventide to muse, Love is a flower of vari-coloured hues, Passion an eagle of uncertain might; Some lips there are that tremble, others close Upon their rapture, faces that grow pale With longing, others shrouded in a veil Of reticence, or flushing as a rose; This seeks to hide emotion, that one shows In every lineament Love's written tale. THE POET. The poet wore a wreath of many years Of labour and of agony of thought, And straightway he the fresh green bay leaf brought That she might crown him whom with outpoured tears And strong solicitude and anxious fears His forward footsteps had unceasing sought; He found her not, and all the fame was nought, And as the sturdier steed the higher rears, He bounded, vehement in passion, back And tore the bay leavesâslowlyâone by oneâ Dropping the crown his worthiness had won In crumpled pieces on the dusty track; What is the world to him who finds it lack The warmth and radiance of Beauty's Sun? WREATHS. A wreath of oak leaves for a runner's head, Gold for the monarch, laurel for the brow Of the successful warrior I trow, Bay leaves upon the poet should be shed, And o'er the tresses of a Genius dead Over the tomb of Charles Dickens they placed a chaplet of roses. To place white roses his admirers bowâ Towards another coronet I vow Allegiance, to a strange ambition wed, A crown of woven ferns and meadow-sweet; I cannot tell you why I choose this thing, But go ye into summer woods and bring The flowers of my choice with speedy feet, And I will sweep the lyre with finger fleet, For very love of recollection sing. A VISION OF THE PAST. I have a Vision, clad in green and gold, Of the Past that seemeth very sweet at times, And wakeneth an echo of old rhymesâ Green for the leafage and the mossy mould And ferny foliage amid which we strolled, Gold for the sunlight falling branches through, Falling upon a face as brightâthat's youâ And mountain-chesnut berries that we hold; Do you remember? I shall not forget, Though now ('tis in November that I write) In that sweet woodland all the leaves are wet, Symbolical of that most sorry blight Which has thought good my withered being to smite Leaving an antique savour of regret. THE PHILOSOPHY OF LOVE. They sat together in an autumn wood, These twoâthey were not very old you knowâ She on a mossy pinnacle, he below, Discussing (do you think they understood The subject, wise ones, ye who wear the hood Of Learning?) the Philosophy of Love! The lady lecturer from the rock above Discoursing, he replying as best he could; Ah well! one âlearned love from a lady's eyesâ Says Shakespeareâthis man's task was sweeter far, More highly privileged are they that are Permitted to become in love-lore wise By teaching of the lips, albeit in sighs The lesson endeth, having left a scar! THE PROMISED LAND. I Let some one else achieve it! it was fair The poetic purpose that I had in view, Sweet as the early sprinkling of the dew, Fresh as the savour of a mountain-air, That distant hint of bay-leaves for the hair, The remote announcement of a work to do; I stood bare-headed underneath the blue Ready a stern allegiance to swear To Beautyâbut alas! it has passed away, And I am cold and shiver and am sad To think that lips of hers have signed a âNay;â I give them up! the joys I might have had, But I would see themâfrom a present bad, A cloudy foggy damp November day. II I would look to the summer that there might have been; I do not groan for loss alone, I mourn The realization of my rapture torn From out my mind, I weep for loves unseen; I might have wandered with my Forest Queen Through dim arched aisles of mystery, sunlit glades, And sat with her beneath the beechen shades, And trodden in time the bending grasses green, And pressed soft palms upon the mossy floors, Seated, and gazing upward in her eyes That put to shame the efforts of the skies When the strong sun has kissed the cloudy doors Of heaven into Beautyâbeing wise I might have won such ecstasy I ween. III But I was foolish, therefore have I failed; And yet I know not if the fault is mine Entirely, or how much to Fate's design Is due, for force of circumstance assailed With vehemence the fortress of my Will; But I will cease from groaning and be still, If only this one thing for which I pine, This boon for which incessant I have wailed Be mine, to see as in a Panoramaâ As unto Moses it was given to see The Promised Land of Canaan that he Was ne'er to enter in a warrior's armourâ If I may but behold my being's drama, My âmight have beenâ expanded before me! NORTH AND SOUTH. They met beneath the darkening orange trees Upon a perfect evening of the South; Just light enough was left for mouth to mouth To find a gentle way when one might please, And in accordance laughed a lover's breeze Across the ripples of the broad blue bay That, softening into night, before them lay, And washed toward their silent resting knees: The one was fair with all the lusty bloom Blown upon faces by the Northern winds, But she showed that pale passion which the minds Of sweet Italia's daughters doth consume, When dark eyes serve to fill the features' room Covering the countenance with most fervent blinds. THE POET'S GRAVE. FIRST VERSION. âHe hath sung sweetly,â so the Lady said, Sweet Poesy, who stood above his grave With tears and claspÃ¨d sorrowing hands that gave A gentle tribute to her hero deadâ âHe hath sung sweetly, let the bays be shed About the brows of one more prophet brave, He hath sung sweetly, let a rose-wreath wave Around the eager brain that beauty fed; He hath sung sweetly,â and she bent, the Queen, To press upon his lips a farewell kiss, But started backâforâwhat a thing is this! The poet's eyes to open slow are seen, ForâBeauty once attained is life I ween, And death it is the beautiful to miss. THE POET'S GRAVE. SECOND VERSION. âHe hath sung sweetly,â so she said, and came, The Lady of the bays, to where he lay Quiet beneath the evening shadows gray, While in the west the sun was as a flameâ âHe hath sung sweetly,â said the gentle dame, Andâhalf a tear fell sudden on the clay, âHe hath sung sweetly, Poetry must pay This tribute to a soul of lofty aim;â But as she said the words, behold, a form Most strong, most beautiful, before her stood, The Poet, risen from his coffin-wood, Alive, heart beating, head conceiving, warmâ ForâBeauty wept for him, for whom he died, And therefore was he present at her side. THE POET'S GRAVE. THIRD VERSION. âHe hath sung sweetly, he hath died for me,â Said Beauty, bending o'er the poet dead, âHe hath sung sweetly, round my hero's head A wreath of farewell bay-leaves let there be, Lilies and roses likewise, in that he Was white as well as unto passion wed, And lastly, let a pearly tear be shed In that I loved himâyea, I do love thee Thou poor pale corpse.â No sooner said than lo! Across his cheek there runs a rosy flush As of the life returning, as the snow At advent of the morning 'gins to blush, Forâwhere are Love and Beauty sideways rush Death's waters in a horror-stricken flow. A CONTEMPLATED VOYAGE. Agross the blue Atlantic to a land Where thought is free, and men may act and speak, And roses blossom in a woman's cheek Without the pruning of Convention's hand, I am goingâso good-bye my native strand, Good-bye to you for many a month and week; Before I see you let me scale the peak Of Chimborazo, by Niagara stand, Across the Rocky Mountains sit astride, Make havoc of the Himmalaya chain, And perhaps before I turn me home again At a canter through Australian deserts ride, Or tame into a steed some zebra pied Caught traversing an Oriental plain. SWEET! I have not written sonnets lately, sweet, About you, have I? what am I to say, What melody wring from out my brain to-day Worthy your soft approving smile to meet, What flower of novel song before your feet Already deep in blossoms shall I lay, A rose-bud, or a white acacia spray, Or golden globÃ¨d lily incomplete? Nay, sweet, on second thoughts it shall be none Of these, cast glance of memory back my Queen, Be quick to apprehend the thing I mean When I recall a sprig of heath undone By careless fingers underneath a sun Of afternoon, and what you asked for glean. THE SUPERNAL LOVELINESS. I Outside a wood upon a summer morn Men were disputingââWhy, I saw her plain,â Said one, âa violet robeâwithout a stain Was hers, and in her hand a lily borneââ âNay, but she held a golden hunting horn,â The second said; the thirdââShe did retain A rose;â and yet anotherââthere remain Red poppies in her hair and plaited corn;â The tale of each was different, and I thought The wonder that the Fairy of the Wood In honest truth-desiring minds has wrought In every poet's fancy is made good, For Beauty we have seen, yet never could Agree as to the panoply she brought; II Nor as to Love, nor as to Music; these Burn in upon our souls in varied guise, As I have seen the shades of woman's eyes Shift delicately lookers on to please; Love hath the savour of a southern breeze To one, the tinting of the northern skies To another, and the musically wise Before a changeful goddess on their knees Bend rapturously; not to two alike Is the Ideal Ecstasy afforded, Behold! the fairy vision I have hoarded On you with face as different may strike As is the land one loves of marsh and dyke From mountains by another's longing lauded. III They have seen her in the wood and they confess That she is beautiful and queen of hearts, But as to e'en the colour of her darts, Still more the fairy fashion of her dress, They are divided, for one lays the stress Upon the folding which her bosom parts, Another at her grace of girdle starts, A third it may be worships none the less The massing of her hair, so in the end Reports must differâbut they come to me, And as I am a poet I can see What each man sees, and satisfied can send These wayfarers to supplicate and bend Before my including Beauty's perfect knee. THE SPARROW AND THE THRUSH. FIRST VERSION. I He thought he was a bard of equal power With others who aforetime twanged the strings, Around whose brows the unfading bay-wreath clings, Before whose feet the people incense shower; Oh, he could sing! as in some summer bower The nightingale an admiring audience brings, So feels our young flushed poet as he flings Aside his sonnets, flower after flower; But winter came, reaction of his glow, And took away the fervent pith and marrow Of the heart that in the heat would overflow, And he, the second singer trained at Harrow!â In a looking-glass beheld himself, and lo, The nightingale was nothing but a sparrow! II But Beauty came, and smiled, and he was glad, And well content to sweep a humble harp, Bringing out at seasons some note strong and sharp, The echo of some vision he had had, The nightingale that had been mute and sad Now burst into a sudden flame of song, The bird that had been but a sparrow long Abandoning his garment brown and bad; For Poesy had said, âmy child, the lyre Gives out a gracious melody in your hands, Be stalwart, be a singer, do not tire; I have my nightingales in many lands, But be an English thrush.â Who understands, May take this double sonnet for his hire. THE SPARROW AND THE THRUSH. SECOND VERSION. I He thought he was a bard who knew the ways Of Poesy, and swept the subtle strings, As when upon a sudden somewhere sings A nightingale, and all the hearers praise The sweet bird hidden in the leafy sprays And hush towards the harmony she brings, When upward each a hand of waiting flings, And halting half advanced each foot delays; He thought he was a poet, he was great In his own estimation, bone and marrow Of genius, trained by cunning eye of fate, The second mighty songster reared at Harrow, Whenâin a looking-glass upon a gate He saw himself perched, and behold, a sparrow! II Then he despairedâbut gentle Beauty came And laid a cooling palm upon his brow, And said, âmy singing bird, be certain now I had not fanned thy passion to a flame To bring thee unto poverty and shame, Nor any who before my footstool bow; He who would write heroic hymns I trow Must be himself, as his most lofty aim;â And then she held a glass before his eyes, And in it, with a sudden choke and rush Of feeling as when hopes achievÃ¨d flush Some sufferer, with a shiver of surprise, Himself again he seemed to recognise, No nightingale, but a bright-breasted thrush. DANTE AND BEATRICE. FIRST VERSION. I He circled round his Queenâas round a flower A hawk moth dances on a summer eve, And having sipped its sweets is loth to leave And seek some other food-supplying bower, So Dante, after fire or icy shower Of agony endurÃ¨d, ceased to grieve For a season, and each circle would achieve A nearer stand-point, a more passionate power; And she stood in the centre of the maze, The purgatory of his tortured heart, And ever and anon the clouds would part And Beatrice was clear before his gaze, And eyes of adoration he might raise, And clean forget that fires and frost-bites smart; II Each circle he was closerâthen he turned Aside another journey to pursue, To brush with weary footstep distant dew; But that he might be certain that not spurned In anywise was he, that pity yearned Towards him, with some flower she would endue His lean worn fingers, with a hare-bell blue, Or rose, or hyacinth, whose beauty burned Till the next meeting, nourishing his soul; But when the circles slackened to a point, And gone was every barrier and joint Of walls of separation, with the whole Of her sweet self she waited at the goal, Not now with any blossom to anoint. ROSES FOR HER. Roses for her! the dark green bays for him, To adorn the furrowed brows, the weary head, Over which leaves of sorrow had been shed As many as on the autumn breezes swim; Lilies for her! for Dante wreathe a dim Grey crown as for one risen from the dead, Through every cell of purgatory led, For whom hell's horror mantled to the brim; For her the flowers of spring, for him the sere And withered branches of the later daysâ O Dante, great worn Dante, whom we praise, By all the ages counted first and dear, Be thine the flaming offerings of the year Being ended, hers its softer opening sprays! PHASES. I From phase to phase I faint, from song to song, Even as the earth, through many changes cast, Once molten fire, shines out green at last, Nor tarries at a single epoch long; My lyre now is plaintive, next is strong Swept by a more sonorous passion blast, Alone a moment, next my thoughts have passed To meet a golden-robed advancing throng; And so I sit and sing; I catch the gleams That flit across my mind like butterflies Across a flower-bed, and I string my dreams Upon a sonnet-necklace as they rise, Hoping my gift may meet approving eyes Of her who mistress of my fancy seems; II From golden bridge of song to bridge of sighs I leap, from rosy ecstasy to gloom, From midday to a twilight darkened room, From summer to a winter that denies Me fire of words wherewith to sacrifice To her who sways the sceptre of my doom, From meads melodious to a silent tomb, From sweet blue waters to a sea of ice; But I continue singingâyea I can By no means bear me otherwise than this, O voice from out the darkness, not a man, I seek to strain imagination's kiss Into a faint similitude of bliss And by my yearning fires of passion fan; III At times I hit the markâthen am I glad In that another jewel of the crown My lady carries I have blazoned down, To her attire another grace to add; That she may be the gladder I am sad, Forgotten for the sake of her renownâ Yea, let her brow be smoother though I frown For ever, she be white though I be bad! But will she hear my singing? yesâI think That even as a stag may stoop its head, Or as a sweet pure swan may downward shed Her dignity at a muddy pool to drink, So may my lady step towards the brink, To taste my song may daintily be led. MUSIC. I When I hear music I am left alone With thee, as if the world were but a wood, And king and queen together we two stood And occupied in unison a throne, Glad leaves against close faces blithely blownâ Ah, sweet, the visionâthis at least is good! That ecstasy of musicâif it could Incessant be by hearts enchainÃ¨d known! For all one's soul is turned into a lyre At such times, and a woman sweeps the strings, And every nerve becomes a note of fire, And every strainÃ¨d fibre pants and rings In answer to the subtle touch that stings Us into one wide flaming of desire; II We are stretched upon a cross of agony, Enduring death perpetual at her hands That shudders into lifeâwho understands, And hath the power to penetrate and see My meaning, I am strong to say that he Hath traversed many acres of love's lands; Our throats are bound in silken stifling bands, One foot is raised, and yet we dare not flee; We are indeed the harp itself she slays From heaven to higher heaven of delight, She tortures, ever new creates in might, New fingered in a hundred lissome ways, The strings o'er which her touch seraphic strays, Now loosens one, now draws another tight! THE LEOPARD. Sweet leopard, kill me, claw me, anything, The more you irritate me I the more Shall love the chiding of your velvet paw, The more you tease me louder I shall sing, The further cast away the closer cling, Fiercely repelled more fervently adore; More gracious far than any peace the war Of feelings those green catlike glances bring; Be merciful and slay me, let me know The utmost sweet abandonment of being, The extremity of a delicious woe, Love, I am here before thee, ceased from fleeing, Be tender if thou canst and strike me so That I may die thy face entrancÃ¨d seeing! âAND KEEP OUR SOULS IN ONE ETERNAL PANT.â âKeats. I âIn one eternal pant to keep our souls,â Said Keats; a poet's motto it might be, To plunge for ever to a deeper sea Of ecstasy, as each wave backward rolls, Exacting pitiless incessant tolls Of riper redder fruit from Love's sweet tree; And, clearly, such the fittest life for me, New wine each day from new provided bowls Perpetually to sip, yet not to fill My craving heart; and so it is, for you Keep all my being in a constant thrillâ Thou hast creative power to renew With every morn the ambrosial passionate dew My eager lips are ever prone to spill; II And so from pant to stronger pant I flow, Even as my River Thames in downward course Boils, whirls, and bubbles with a fiercer force, In haste the unfettered open sea to know; So in a great increasing volume go My pulses, waxing hotter as the days Make more apparent far my lady's praise, And as the winter waneth; even so The summer of my love is drawing nigh, With sweet May-blossoms and the lilac bloom, And all the streets made heavy with perfume, And visions of a softer bluer sky; So with the seasons, with the stream I sigh And change and eddy, sparkle and consume. THE PEARL NECKLACE. What can I give you, sweet? I am but poor As men count riches, yet I have my pen That flings aside a ruby now and then, Or emerald not all unworthy your Acceptance; seeing I will not endure With aught save choicest jewels to bedeck That pure unequalled choicer Parian neck What gift of passionate sense can I procure? Well, I will take my heart and string the same Upon a necklaceâlady, will that do? Each pearl shall be a sonnet, and its hue The brighter, in that tinged with blood it came, The clearer, being cleansed in the flame That burns incessant sacrifice to you. THE LOVE-PHILTRE. âBut she will love you, kiss you perhaps, who knows? Come take it, don't be foolish,â so persuaded A simple youth a witch with features faded, And hump-back orthodox, and rusty clothes, Pressing upon him hard a magic dose By which his love-suit might be swiftly aided; But he recoiled, and, vehement, upbraided Her foul intention, saying, âlet my rose Bloom on and let me wither if so be, But let her pierce me with her own sweet eyes Deluded by no draught prepared of thee Even if heaven to me the truth denies; Thy gift I accept not in anywise, Avaunt enchantress, vanish quickly, flee!â THE LAST SONNET. Your presence is not always with me, sweet, As a conscious summer sky to dome me round With rapture, or a soft encircling sound, Or tenderest embrace of arms that meet, Or sense of cool refreshment after heat, Or wreath of flowers about my temples wound; I seem to lose the treasure I have found, And in the distance fade departing feet: But, back you come, with the old threatening hair, And grace and melody of returning spring, More cruelly delightful, and more fair; As each successive season seems to bring Grass greener, sweeter roses, birds that sing The stronger, beauty brighter yet you wear. PART II. LATER SONNETS. THE SONNET-THRONE. I I would have built a throne of sonnets high And seated you thereonâan ivory throneâ A delicate golden sceptre all your own My hand had been most cunning to supply, And crimson curtains should have fluttered nigh, And flower after flower have been sown, That regal perfumes might be gently blown About you, queenly colours greet your eye; Butâyou are gone! and in disgust I hurl My chisel down, I split my poet's pen, The gorgeous hangings I am quick to furl, The flowers to uproot that flourished when Their petals might anticipate the ken That raised me to a singer from a churl. II What shall I do without you? Can I write Worship and sigh towards the barren airs, And having laid so many careful stairs, Each step a sonnet, gold or rosy white Alternate, lady, lady, is it right To leave the queenly seat at top unfilled? Over the silken cushion I have spilled My very soul in flowery phrases bright, And now you scorn my offering! downâdownâdown With every step and stone and ornament! Just as an angry child with bitter frown Sweeps all the toys aside to which he lent His heart a moment since, so am I bent On utterly destroying this fair town! THE SERENADER. FIRST VERSION. Out at a window looked a lady fair, Set, like a miniature, sweet within the frame, And upward gazed a youth with heart a-flame, Who laughing said, âTo-night I will prepare A serenade to soften all the air, And shafts of singing at that casement aim;â The night wore on, the lover never came, For pouting lips had answered, âIf you dare!â But O, sweet lady, he has done it still, He could not help it, please his fault condone, He could not find a lyre of silver tone Enough to satisfy his searching will That autumn, therefore has he sought to fill Two volumes with the serenader's moan! THE SERENADER. SECOND VERSION. Out at a window looked a lady sweet, And smiled towards an admiring youth below, Who answered, âGracious Madam, I shall go And buy a harp whose strings by finger fleet Swept cunningly may move a melody meet Towards that casement and its hand of snow,â Came quickly wafted down a laughing âNo,â Silent of serenading was the street. Butâthe forbidden song is here instead, Filling two volumes with a swell of sound, For what are all my poems choicely bound But a flowery Serenade whose petals shed Their perfume round about your sleeping head, Filling the window, covering the ground? TRY AGAIN. âSweet, try again;â so Beauty said to me; As wipes a mother tenderly the face Of her child who has stumbled, eager, in a race, Till once again his features beam with glee, So would God's pale humanity smile if He Vouchsafed a similar maternal grace, If He would bid our souls resume the chase Undaunted, what a glory it would be! So thought I, and a little bird came nigh With gentle eyes and glistening plumes of blue Just as my passion ended in a sigh Of doubt, and joy was potent to renew, Whispering, as if with message from the sky, âThe thought is no deceit, child, it is true.â BROWN AND RED. FIRST VERSION. âWhat can I do to please you?â answer then Was wanting, lady, I will tell you now; Let my poor poems round about your brow Wave as a wreath of flowers, or as when In a tiara jewels twice times ten Flash like red fruits that 'tween the branches bow, Accept my service, this my gift allow, The first aspiring produce of my pen; I plucked, sweet, I remember once for you A tiny plant with tender separate leaves Of red, that olden gift I would renew, My poem is successful if it weaves Itself within your memory, and achieves A proud position, peeping brown hair through. BROWN AND RED. SECOND VERSION. âWhat can I do to please you?â answer none There was, but, lady, I will tell you how If so disposed your heart may please me now, But first let feet of memory backward run, And tell me whether you remember one Sweet plant I plucked for you in former days, A tender delicate plant with ruby sprays, Red separate leaflets kindled by the sun? You do remember? good; then let my song Be even such a sweet red flower, and bound Within the black-brown hair I loved, and wound The tresses I caressed in thought among, That when a host of other jewels throng Superior, there that leaf may still be found. BROWN AND GOLD. I Sweet colours as I think! a golden band Mingled with black the Bride of Corinth wore, That flashed upon her lover when the door Gave sudden ingress to a snow-white hand, And, sweet, for you a circlet I have planned To mingle if it may be with the brown Soft tresses, and I lay it gently down, My âpoemsâ namely, do you understand? But I am too ambitious, such a gift Is not for me, but rather if I may Let me a second time my hand uplift (For once before I touched your hair in play) And, awkward as I am, I may make shift To twine therein a gold thread that shall stay; II It was a peacock's feather that old time Before that, as a boy, tight in your hair I twistedânothing, lady, half as fair I bring now, only a stray wreath of rhyme, No peacock's feather spotted and sublime With many eyes and Eastern colours rare, Rather a brown pale plume a man might tear From some street-sparrow in our colder clime; But take it as it is, and it may be That touched by you a wonder shall be done, And as a black bird underneath the sun Shining with many colours you may see, So suddenly across my rhyme may run Paradise-plumage, tropic brilliancy! NOT GONE? O sweet you are not gone? it cannot be, You must be waiting underneath the light, Amid the perfume of a Northern night, And soon the moon will rise above the sea And silver, as of old, the ruin, and we Shall wander off together out of sight, It cannot but be soâit is not right That anything so exquisite should flee! No, I am certain that you still are there Under those dreamy pale blue Northern skies, Not a day older, not an hour, as fair As ever, with the same delicious eyes, And panoply of sweetly pert replies, And with that same divinely-coloured hair. THE SAME AS EVER. Under the dim blue Northern skies she waits The same as ever, days are but a dream, At night again the green witch-glances gleam As fierce as ever through my fancy's gates, And shifted is the circle of the fates, Backward my strong imaginations stream, Present in living force past figures seem, And blotted out my memory's evil dates; And she is waiting, and that strange pale crown Of turquoises and pearls is on her brow, White cloudsâblue spacesânever shining now Across the sky, but in that long-lost town I am present, and again am kneeling down To that Witch-Lady my sole self to vow! HARMONIA AND THE HANDMAIDEN. A sweet handmaiden Poesy had sent To lead her servant to the palace-gates, But she herself within the entrance waits, On a most gracious interviewing bent, And he was half aware of her intent, But on the thither road he fell in love With the handmaiden, and preferred the dove To the Paradise-bird for his approval meant; Here was a mess! Harmonia held him fast, He, like a child, to the handmaiden clung, And jealous heart of Poesy he stung By screaming, all his spirit backward cast, âNot you, old woman, her I love,â and flung His form convulsed away from her at last! MY FIRST PROOF-SHEETS. The proof is in my hand; this very day Last year my earliest sonnet I achieved, But when I wrote it who could have believed That coiled behind it such a lengthy lay Was waiting, that the words I had to say Would fill the paper I have just received, That thus my brain was thickly interleaved With sheets to be redeemed without delay? Well, well, the first-fruits of my work are here, But where are those âfair eyesâ of which I wrote That made my sonnet's melody so dear? And where alas! the form that seemed to float As graceful as a maiden in a boat Along the lines I struggling bent to rear? PYGMALION'S DOOM REVERSED. Happy Pygmalion! that the tender boon Thou didst implore sweet Venus granted thee, See how thy fate hath been reversed for me In that alive the Lady of my Tune Was at the first, but now a marble swoon Hath caused her soft supremacy to flee, A fairer flush each day 'twas thine to see, Not even a statue shall be present soon For me to sing to, thou didst twine around That image passionate arms that met the stone, And every hour more warm the marble found, My harder fate it is to sit and moan The desolate seat of a vacated throne, Embraces swiftly by cold force unwound! THE LOVE-NOTES. Yesterday afternoon I strove to sing Against a thrush high-perched upon a bough, And certain notes that only every now And then he introduced, seemed soft to ring As if âDo you love me, sweet,â or some such thing He kept repeating, and I failed to seize, Accomplishing the stronger quavers, these To which the thrush's soul most close did cling; Ah! then I thought, the reason's very plain, These are the love-notesâjust as never man Indite a sonnet for another can, So these most luscious notes that downward rain Are thoughts original of the thrush's brain, And straight from out his love-sick fancy ran. THE HANDMAIDEN WITH THE GREEN GREEN EYES. I âOh, that handmaiden with the green green eyes!â So wept a youth within the palace-gate Where Poesy herself in cumbrous state Sat with a chin uplifted to the skies, âOh, sweet handmaiden, where art thou?â he cries, âMy love is wasted on this dame sedate, That I had held thee fast! too late! too late!â Even so his tearful shrieks incessant rise; For Poesy had sent a maiden fair Unto the portals of her lordly dome, The golden pillars of her palace-home, To lead the singer whom she would ensnare, But on the way down came the maiden's hair Through sudden slip of untrustworthy comb, II And he, poor poet, had to bind it fast Again as she threw back her gentle head Tossing the sweet brown tresses freely shed Over her shoulders his pale fingers past, And, as he did it, he forgot the vast And solemn Goddess unto whom she led The way, and loved her messenger instead, And all his heart into his hands he cast; And therefore in an agony he tries To break in twain the lyre that before His fervent touch, caressing, would adore, And low upon the bitter marble lies, Sobbing towards the unsympathizing floor âThat sweet hand-maiden with the green green eyes!â WHAT SHALL I DO? I What shall I do when music fades away, When silence occupies the world of things, And not a throat of any throstle sings, And not a single sunset but is gray, When blue forsakes the summer, and to day And night a sodden robe of fog-damp clings, And never a rosy dream the twilight brings, And not a sonnet has a word to say? What shall I do when these things come to pass, When moons are mute, and all the stars are pale, And ever, as the winter rushes wail And shiver at the East wind stalks of grass, I tremble, fingers powerless alas! To make my loosened harp-strings of avail? II What shall I do when all these things are mine? A love that was in summer, and instead The frozen pallor of a wintry head, A wreath of meadow-sweet I used to twine, But now of icicles a lengthy line, And pale snow-berries for the golden-red Fruit of the mountain chesnut, and a dead White waste of foam, a scentless field of brine, For sweet green waters, and for flowers tears, And fervour barrenness, and fire cold, And roses of the summer some sad old And wrinkled dowager rose of later years, For softest orange-blossoms square-cut biers, And for forget-me-not a corpse to hold? THOU COULDST NOT WATCH WITH ME. I Thou couldst not watch with me one little hourâ One little hour, sweetheart, only one, To wait the crimson outleap of the sun, Was it too much for thee, that icy shower, And were the roses angry on thy bower, And did the braids of sweet hair come undone, And were the waves irreverent to stun Thy tender lack of man's enduring power? Thou couldst not watch with meâthe flowers are thine Red in the valleys, fragrant in the meads, The purple foam-flecked scentless road that leads Through solitude to sunrise, that is mine; Thou couldst not watch with meâtoo weak to twine Thorn-crowns, lest any dainty finger bleeds; II Thou couldst not watch with meâI would have torn From out the raging waters of the years That are to be, a crown of passionate tears For a pearl-circletâsplendour of the morn As yet beneath the ocean had been born For thee, and round thy forehead as a star Songs many and triumphant from afar, The shouts of victors in the times of dawn; Thou couldst not watch with meâthe night behind Swallows thee up, in front the great strong sea Salt hands of welcome stretches out to me, Alone upon a barren beach I find Myself, eyes open that before were blind, Thou couldst not wait and shall I wait for thee? III Thou couldst not watch with meâthe violets smile To see the backward fluttering of thy feet, A peaceful sojourn in the valley, sweet, Be thine, a homestead in the green defile, Soft dreams and whispers of the roses, while I bare my lonely forehead, pale to meet The increasing future fiery circle's heat, That rises, red as a volcano-isle; I laugh to hear the tumult of the breezeâ I weep to see the splendour of the dayâ I weep to think that thou art far away Still treading soberly the moonlight leas, That toys and trifles have a charm to please And not the wholesome savour of the spray; IV Sweet spray that splashes fast across my lipsâ What touches yours? and was it good to choose The sheltered sunny hill-side, and refuse The broader rapture of a foot that dips Deep in the foam, a rosy mouth that sips The ocean sparkle? round my brows be twined Fresh seaweed, flowers of green and pink combined, Do thou the rather with fair finger-tips Dabble amid the tufted foam of grass, Make cowslip-balls, and pondering divide Like Marguerite alone at eventide The tender daisy for divining glass, While through these misty barriers I pass Into the future thou didst deem too wide. V Thou hast chosen rather to turn backward eyes Towards the sunset, and the old sweet tales, Asking, with smile incredulous, what avails The fervour of a heart that towards sunrise The rapid footstep of its pulses plies, And latest swathings of the dark assailsâ I am in love with that white cheek that pales, I am in love with that fleet foot that flies, I am in love with glances backward thrown, Backward or forward they are sweet to me, Beckons thee onward finger of the sea In haste to win a daughter for his own, Beckons thee backward thine untroubled throne, And quiet creeds to which to bow the knee; VI Beckon thee backward gentle palms uplifted, And amber robes and raiment of the skies, Hasten thee onward faint awakening cries From far-off unborn isles and oceans driftedâ Beckons thee backward some strong angel gifted With sword to sweep the people and devour, But forward draws thee scent of some sweet flower, Or delicate shade of sunrise sudden shifted; Love lies in front; behind, the golden gates, And sound perpetual of ascending hymns, And beatific bending of the limbs Are thine; the wind-kissed crimson clover waits In front, and as the turbid heaven abates, From heavenly waves rise clear-cut, starry rims; VII Behind, the moonlight and the shadows long Across the furrows, and the dark-green trees, In front, calm eyes of morning and the breeze That stirs the silent meadows into song, Behind, the lyres of a saintly throng And stone indented deep by roughened knees In front, stern faces and the forms of these Who bow towards the future, and are strong; Behind are many gardens and the fruits That redden lighting up the autumn walls, Green spaces where the mellow apple falls, Brown circles shadowed by the rose-tree roots, Paths planted either side with lilac shoots, Broad sweeps of gravel, dim-lit cloistered halls; VIII Behind, the voices of a jewelled choir, An ornamented, ring-bedizened band Whose feet along the aisles of heaven stand, In front, the flashing of a far-off fire, Red embers breathed upon by hot desire, The first announcement of an unfound land, And here and there a grain of golden sand The pale adventurers' hard-won glimpse of hire; Cool seats behind, and shady arbours those, Chosen of butterflies, beloved by beesâ My lady, what hast thou to do with these Who art thyself the envy of the rose, Thou that art delicate to do with snows, And with the salt-lipped bluster of the breeze? IX Abide in peace, yea, tarry, be at restâ The eventide and sunset unto thee I leave, but as for others, as for me, Let the blue waves upon their loftiest crest, Shot like a sunbeam from that flaming nest, Bear me triumphant to the further sea; I will not tarry longer under lee Of those tall cliffs by cowardice possessed; Forward I hasten; and I send my song Across the breakers to the sandy shore Where thou art standing, and I join the roar, The melody of giants hurled along, The chant of many wayfarers that throng To some fair future, to the past no more. THE POET'S GARDEN. THE ROSE. A poet loved a roseâand watched it grow; And every day a sweeter blush was there, And pouting petals fuller and more fair, Each eventide âto-morrow it will blow,â The poet said, âto-morrow I shall know The perfect splendour of this flower rare,â Sometimes its beauty more than he could bear Brought tears for joy's excess akin to woe; And so he watched it; and one night he said, âI see my rose upon the verge of bloom, To-morrow royal robes she shall assume, Uplift to heaven a pink most perfect head,â But when he came next day the rose was dead, And on that spot they placedâa poet's tomb! THE LILY. A poet loved a lilyâand his eyes Were set upon this flower from afar, Just as a man may tremble towards a star, Distance between them many miles of skies; So, similarly, swayed the singer's sighs This silver glitter, this white moon of plants, And little rest unto himself he grants (A somewhat passionate soul, not overwise) Preparing a choice mossy bank whereon His sonnets strown might make a velvet bed For soft reclining of the lily's head, He thought that there some time she should have shone, Butâpoets pity him!âhe found her gone One day, brown gaping garden-mould instead. THE VIOLET. A poet loved a violetâand he thought âThe purple is in bud: it is not blown; 'Twas only yesterday that it was sown, And but the day before the plot was bought;â And so he turned his heart aside, and sought To buy a vase wherein the flower grown To perfect beauty for his very own He might have, and his hands a marvel wrought, A many-coloured, cunning, carven glass, Choice, set with jewels, painted by his pen, Sides gilt with some sweet poem now and then, And he had set it down upon the grass Beside the violetâwhen a shower alas! A hail-storm, shattered it in seconds ten. THE PRIMROSE. I A poet loved a primrose in a woodâ âTransplant it some day,â said he, âthat will I, Not under shadow of boughs but under skyâ Blue skyâthis tender flower should have stood; Mistake of gardener! I will make it good, Correct the early error by and bye;â And then he left the primrose with a sigh, And ran to fetch the quickest tools he could; He was not long; I heard a linnet say, (You know I understand the speech of these) A linnet perched upon a hazel spray, âIn less than half a song,â upon his knees The poet wasâso tell me, primrose, please, Was there a breathless second of delay? II He fell upon his knees before he saw That nothing but a hollow brown was left, A clean triangle by a trowel cleft, That not a pretty primrose any more Was smiling, that a hand had been before His urgent speed, and consummated theft; For ever of that flower-face bereft He turned aside, and closed the forest-door. But still, they say, a poet by the grave Of that sweet primrose may be seen to walk O' nights, and heard in incoherent talk, And ever to himself doth sob and rave âWhy did not passionate fingers dig the cave? Thou fool, to run for trowel, line, and chalk!â THE POET'S AVIARY. THE NIGHTINGALE. I A poet loved a nightingaleâand she Would sing to him, and he was speechless yet, But vowed solicitude to weave a net Wherein the tender bird entrapped might be, And when the moon was silver on the sea, And all the leaves with silver splashes wet, He came to that sweet cliff-top wood to set The cunning of his hand beneath the tree; And as he passed along the dusty road He met a boy who swung a wicker cage, âSome linnet or a chaffinch, I'll engage,â He commented contemptuous, as he strode Towards the trysting-tree with heart that glowed, A war of mingled melody to wage; II The beauty of the night was on the leaves, They trembled to the tuning of a wind That wept among the stalks, and wailed, and pined, Not other than a human sufferer grieves, And on the left hand silver shone the sheaves; âTo-night,â he thought, âmy lady will be kind,â âTo-night,â so smiled he, âsurely I shall find The guerdon that a songful soul achieves;â So pondered he, and trembled, and advanced, Whenâfeathers and a broken trap he saw, Dirt scattered here and there by frightened claw, As here and there the clinging feet had chanced To alightâone groan he uttered as he glanced, âThat was my bird then!ââspake aloud no more. THE HAWK. I A poet loved a hawkâsweet, wild-eyed, strong To flutter from the staying of a hand, And, subtle, soon a silken lure he planned, And wove in vari-coloured threads of song, Now gold, now crimson, and his work was long And wearisome, but still the thought sustained His soul, âWhen once my falcon I have gained, How we will soar above the vulgar throng! For she shall raise me; I will teach my bird The art of singing, she shall show me how To beat the azure wave with windy brow, In soft ethereal heights as yet unstirred Save by her sweet brown flying, shall be heard The added pinion of her poet now.â II So mused he; and his silken lure he brought, And trembled as his fingers sought the wrist His passion craved, imperious, to have kissed, But then his labour had been all for nought; The falcon's crest was eager, and he thought âI have my beauty safe with one more twist, To carry on a closed triumphant fist, My green-eyed bird, my darling, fairly caught! One more twist,â as he stooped to tie the thread, (Gold beads of many sonnets strung thereon) A rustle and a shiverâoverhead The laughing dark eye of the falcon shone, âYou thought you had me safe, but I am gone, Good-bye my poet, love your lure instead.â THE FIRST WOMAN. God made a woman; and he stood aghast For very wonder; as a sculptor sees With terror and with trembling of the knees And tears of yearning his Ideal fast Emerging from the marble, so God cast His careless chisel downward, clasped his hands! And keen upon the Ivory Foot that stands Across the ages in expansion vast The edge fellâhardly did he feel the sting, But blood was drawn, and ever since the day When God's great poem âWomanâ out of clay His cunning hand was powerful to bring, He bears in recollection, so they say, Across his foot that clean-cut ruby ring. WHAT CAN I GIVE YOU? I What can I give you, lady? pearls will soon Be many, as I doubt not, in your handâ What silver memory from a former land, What echo of a chat beneath the moon, What vision, in a sonnet for a boon Set daintily, shall I be bold to place Among the many presents proud to grace Your boudoir, what choice jewel of a tune? I cannot give you half, I give you all, My songs, my volumes, both of them, completeâ You are my books, and they are nothing, sweet, But one long sounding of a throstle's call Whose hope is high that next his own may fall The patter of another throstle's feet; II The soft alighting on a neighbouring bough Of the bright-breasted bird he doth adore; Such are my poems, lady, nothing more, A diadem to circle that pure brow, A peacock's feather twined the tighter now That through my negligence it fell before, The scent of fancy's myrtle bruised and sore, The voiceful repetition of my vow; This then I give you; even your sweet soul, Your own sweet self, my lady, back again, Your self made audible in subtle strain, And visible on wings of words that roll Sonorousâyou, the prompter of the whole, Its ecstasy, its agony, its pain! WELL? I Well? have I stirred the ancient chord at all, Brought any flower of dreamland back to view, Moved any depth of feeling strange and new, My lady, by my long-sustainÃ©d call? When, like a withered autumn leaf let fall, My book is thrown upon your lap, can I Discern a deeper colour in your eye, Have I made memory's waning height more tall? I have done my work if I have made you weep In any place, in any made you sigh; I meant at least one pearly tear to reap, For very love I meant to make you cry, You can be cruel, sweetheart, so can I, Come, hands away from face, and let me peep; II I meant to make you laugh and weep as well, To let you know that every word you said Hath found immortal wings, by no means dead, For each upon a fertile fancy fell, That on my singing fingers I can tell Each smile as readily as when 'twas shed, That you are throned in my creative head, A queen within a fructifying shell; And so you can't escape me! down they go, Sweet looks and sourâwhich were most for me? Hair loose and waving, as I loved to see The ripples of its unimpeded flow, Or, braided tight, as you would have, you know, A seemlier more becoming way must be; III Lips angry, pouting, just as they are now, I thought they would be when you came to thisâ Noânot the fire, ladyâyou might miss The mark, and then the mantelpiece, I vow! âSweet sober vision of a thoughtful brow, And delicate flush I chiefly loved to see, The rose of night that reddened soft when we Talked talk bewitchingâyou remember how? Well, shall I stop, or is it there again, The flush I speak of? never mind, my time Is short, and I am speechless save in rhyme, The voice emphatic of a poet's pain, That need be to you but the patter of rain Outside the glass it vainly longs to climb. GRAINS OF SAND. SWEET EYES. In places many I have been Through hours of life's long day, Sweet eyes full many I have seen, But none so sweet as they, Eyes coloured like the moss-water Of green and brown and gray. FROM SUNSHINE. Once a maiden shielded me from sunshine, Interposing wealth of silk between, Simple heart of hers it was that won mine, Ne'er shall I forget that silken screen, Till the parted rivers run in one line Not one single barrier between! II Once she shielded me from fervent light, Fervent beating of the midday sun, Sheâthe shielderâhath forgotten quite, Iâthe shieldedâthough the ages run Into most chaotic endless night Hug the closer this that she hath done; Hug the closer memories one or two âI have not got many, friends, you seeâ Clasp the closer memories a few Clustered round my being's barren tree, Breathing gentle solace unto me, Gentle soothing, as of summer dew; I have triumphed once at least in lifeâ If I fail for ever, and am hurled Out of Beauty's into Blackness' world, Into lands with desolation rife, This may calm the fury of the strife, Once for me a flag hath been unfurled! YESTERDAY'S DEW. Priests are many, but men are few, See that you become As much yourself as yesterday's dew, Though strangely alike in some Respects, was nevertheless quite new, And never again will come. TO-MORROW. What shall I say of to-morrow? Judging by life of to-day, WreathÃ¨d it will be with sorrow Pale, and with rosier play, Sweet-smelling hours that borrow Happiness, soon to decay, Leaving a burthen to follow, An arrow of sun-god Apollo, A gap and a resonant hollow, In hearts once merry as May. A LOVER'S APOLOGY FOR KISSING HIS MISTRESS' HANDWRITING. Your hand touched the pen and the pen touched the place, And that's quite enough, love, for me, If I can't kiss yourself why I needs must trace In your writing an image of thee. A KISS. A kiss can awake the dead, And snap the iron of Fate, And lift the Universe-weight, And change the colour of hate, And raise or sbatter a state, And give to a lone bird a mate, To a world, to an era, a date; The worth of a kiss men rate By lips off which it is shed. WHAT A SMILE CAN DO. Sweet, do you know what a smile can do? Listen, and I will tell; Send upon souls that are dry, soft dew, Scatter the fires of hell, From grey clouds open a glimpse of blue, Oceans of happiness swell, Slay false dreams, bringing in the true, Change a funereal knell, Breezes that over the churchyard blew, Into the wind of a bell WingÃ¨d with echoes of sounds that flew News of a marriage to tell. A QUESTION. One look I have especial in my mindâ Ah! Lady, cruel lady, was it fair To rouse a hope predestined not to find Fulfilment, thus to flood the rosy air With radiance, that I might the sooner share Despondent wintry darkness of the blind? THE HOT CLEAR WEATHER. Pleasant is the hot clear weather For twoâtwin swallows together Soaring aloft in the sky, But sad for one all alone, Cast down from his bright blue throne, To sit upon the ground and moan, And die! GONE IS THE BEAUTY. Gone is the Beauty, clean gone, And what do I care for the rest? Stripped is the sun that shone Of its rays, of its feathers the nest, And yet men mock me, and tell me That these things are all for the best! THE ROSE. Where is the Rose I gave you, sir? Is this the sorry way You treat the gifts that I confer? Comeâhave you lost it, eh? Orâvalued it as much as her You used to loveâin play? The Rose is gone, but, sweet, the fact Is such a flower scatters So easily its petals packed, Your gift so highly flatters, Thatâin one wild impulsive act I kissed it all to tatters! VERILY THEY HAVE THEIR REWARD. Verily they have their reward! The men who enamoured of Beauty With cold eyes looked upon Duty, And whether hell had for a booty Their bodies, cared not at all, So that upon them was poured Beauty, they have their reward. Verily they have their reward! The men who for Holiness' sake Cup of the Queen would not take, Thirst of their throats to slake At Beauty's river refused, For the sake, they thought, of the Lord, These too have their reward. Verily they have their reward! Philosophers proud, who have spilled Beauty's blood, and have killed Duty besides, and filled This world with the worship of Truth, And facts of Science have roared In our ears, they have their reward. Verily they have their reward! Souls that have faithful been To Beauty, a Goddess, a Queen, And Kinghood of Goodness have seen, And Truth for a daughter have known Of these twain, bearing a sword Golden, they have their reward. SURELY TO DIE IS GOOD! Keats (loquitur). Surely to die is good; We are born it seems for this, To win us a long cold kiss, A second of infinite bliss, Snatched from beneath Death's hood, Surely to die is good! Goethe (loquitur). Surely to live is better; We are born for this the rather, To many a kiss to be father, To many a rose-pink letter, To many a luscious night And new moon's maze of delight, To many a flowery fetter, Surely to live is better! SUNSET OVER THE MULGRAVE WOODS. Such a sunset! draping clouds in golden Robes, and casting colour all abroad, Glad to show to nobody beholden Is she for it, plenty more is stored, Plenty more to-morrow morning molten Masses on the canvas will be poured; Blue and pink and crimson intershaded, Interwoven, soft as beauty's hair, Tracery most intricately braided, Delicate as lace-work here and there, One into another fashions faded, Paler than the former, but as fair; Best of all the bloom upon the woodlands, Golden, rosy, dying into white, Surely underneath them something good stands, Sleeps a gracious fairy of the night, Glad to stretch towards us if she could hands Bountiful, and sparkle into sight. A LETTER. Sweet, I tell you that I love you still, Have you, have you quite forgotten me? Every separate tinkle of the rill That the fresh sweet water-cresses fill, Winding on its way to turn the mill, Every flower where we used to be, Hath a power all of me to thrill; There was a forget-me-not I sent In a letterâI have never heard Whether you accepted what I meant, Whether you the pouting eyebrows bent In a rage, and my poor missive rent? Answer me, this time, a single word, 'Tis the last time,âI will be content. HER BEDROOM. She had waited, silly, overlong, She had dallied, now she lay in bed, Ended was her coy coquettish song, She had put him off, 'twas very wrong, By her bedside flourished blue and strong The forget-me-not, but she was dead, And he, coming, found a flower instead, And a gaping sad funereal throng. THE MAN OF GENIUS. Once a man of genius there walked By the Galilean inland sea, Taught of heaven in parables he talked Wonderfully, âwho can this man be?â Said the peopleâPharisees he balked And the rulersââtell us who is he?â Eighteen Christian centuries have tried This responsive doubtful task to do, Needles philosophical have plied, Spades of metaphor and poetry tooâ âGod he is,â at last the Churches cried, âGod Himself,ââbut is the answer true? CONTRASTS. Pleasure is sweet and sweet the scent of rosesâ But sad the vanished fragrance of the past, If flowers are fair the flowers do not last, Within the petals lo! the worm reposes. Love is of God, divine the face of Loveâ Granted, but doth Love fill the visible earth, Doth God to everything that is give birth, And is not even God strong Fate above? Rosy is youth and sweet the early yearsâ But youth shall vanish, and for fervour frost Shall sparkle, and the rose-hue shall be lost, And smiles give sorry place to future tears. A DREAM. I dreamed that I was lying With my head upon her breast, Wings folded, ceased from flying, As a bird's are in his nest; Very happy was I, lying, And her breath like gentle dew Kept over me soft flying, How I wish the dream was true! A MELODY. The wings of the melody take me Speeding back to the place Where last the light did forsake me, The light of my true love's face, The waves of the melody wake me, And her sweet image I trace; Trace as when last I saw it, The face of a goddess, a queen, Teeth of the years shall not gnaw it, For ever as it hath been In the past, without freckle or flaw, it By eyes of my mind shall be seen; Well I remember the night when Last met hands of us twain, Dark was it, gone was the light then, Pleasure made way for pain, Morning will beam on my sight when My Sun-queen shineth again! OVER! Yea, it is over, sweet, and now Alone we face the seasons, Alone life's fickle fallows plough, And find our trusts were treasons, Alone we trudge, we two, I trow, For at last we've found our reasons! BAGPIPES. I love sweet roses, but instead I only gather night-shade, And round about my nightly head Instead of poppies bright, laid Sweet slumber thereupon to shed, Bagpipes are till the light played! THE IMAGE OF EACH. Surely the image of each Will one day burst the veil Of the body, and rend the mail In twain of the flesh, and the pale Sick shrouds to our feet that reach, Clouding the image of each! One day the gleams that we see Now upon faces at times, The lame disjointed rhymes, The clustering vine that climbs, A sun, a poem, will be, And the last a great strong tree, Tall, planted in fervent climes! THE ENGLISH MAIDENS. I Ah me! the English maidens, How beautiful they are, You will not find their equals Although you wander far Through sunset-lighted Aidenns, And search from star to star. II How beautiful they might be! If one fair woman knew The wonder of her womanhood, And would but carry through Right to the end her own ideal, Unshaken, steadfast, true. III The very thought delights me, The fact I shall not see, It startles, it affrights me, Compared with what they beâ And yet they hope from frightfulness The sons of men to free! SONGS. BEAUTY WITH GREEN EYES. Beauty with green eyes, Beauty with grey, Soft as the sunrise, Bright as the day, Be to me kind skies, Hearken, I pray; Beauty with grey eyes, Beauty with brown, Lo! what a depth lies, Deepâdeep downâ You must be very wise! Noâdon't frown; Beauty with brown eyes, Beauty with green, Just as each shade dies, My sighs, Queen, Follow, and sorrow flies Colours between! THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG. That must have been the reason, that yesterday I heard What made the hope of seeing you a hope for months deferred, Why, though before I fancied I had conquered and was strong, I went to bedâand dreamed of you the whole night long; I had wooed an abstract Goddess, I had bowed before the feet Of art, the marble Lady, and had found her worship sweet, But night brought back reality, by day I did thee wrong, Avenged thou artâI dreamed of thee the whole night long; In the clash of arms, so hath it our Tennyson, forgets A man love's early savours and the younger years' regrets, I doubt itâwhen the lull came, and ceased the cannons' song, I think that I should dream of you the whole night long; What do I care for Progress, the triumphant âmarch of mind?â My eyes keep backward looking into eyes long left behind, By day I fail to reach them, when sleep-lit fancies throng They shine upon me tenderly the whole night long; To merge oneself in action is well enough by day, It's not so very hard then to drive a thought away, How will it be when darkness puts a point to memory's prong? WhyâI shall lie and dream of you the whole night long; âCome be a man,â they say to one, âassert the inborn strength Of manhood, why should any love become a love of length?â I know notâbut when silence slays the clatter of the gong Of daytime, I shall dream of you the whole night long. A DREAM OF ROSES. He dreamed a dream of roses, And bowers of delight Where rosy love reposes Through soft sweet hours of night, Till eyes of his uncloses The coming of the light; He dreamed of faces never Seen save in depth of dreams, When hours of darkness sever What is from that which seems, And raptures gone for ever Return in rainbow gleams; He dreamed that he was walking By side of maiden fair, A happy twain were talking, And breath of evening air Was sweet, and moths were hawking Around them everywhere; And sweet the scent of clover, And smiles of flowers around, And odours wafted over Their heads, and o'er the groundâ Queen Loveliness a lover At eventide has found; The summer seems to bear them Aloft in arms of love, As if from earth to tear them And carry them above, All pain henceforth to spare them, Brooding with wings of dove Over sweet souls united In silken love-spun bond, Their separate beings plighted By oath of kisses fond, When lips that blush delighted, Cling eager, and beyond The veil seems half uplifted And meaning of the world Made plain, the curtain shifted, The drop-scene upward furled, And cloud-wreaths sidelong drifted, And fog-banks backward hurled; For many a misty season Clears up with love beside, Truth is too much for treason When two together ride, And bright the reign of Reason Beneath the sway of bride; Four eyes can pierce a cloud-veil That baffles two alone, What seemed to be a shroud pale In rainbow colours shown Shines, as a suit of proud mail Behind a monarch's throne! The loneliness that slays us Is over, and instead From brokenness to raise us A downward bending head Hangs over us, and sways us With smiles from heaven shed; And, were it not a dream, love, My very soul would leap, In rosy lips that gleam, love, Like flowers from out a deep Dim summer-scented sea, love, Its utmost self to steep, Pressing from out the roses All odours strong to save, The ecstasy that closes One's eyes as in a grave Dug deep in seas of posies Whose lips about one wave! WHEN WE ARE LEFT ALONE! Love shall mount to his throne, my sweet, Love shall mount to his throne, Soon, when friends that abide To say good-bye by our side Have finally farewell cried, When we are left alone, my sweet, When we are left alone! Now you are all my own, my sweet, Now you are all my own, But many a kiss must wait Till we sit by ourselves in our state, Gone, given up to our fate, When we are left alone, my sweet, When we are left alone! Sweet to me now is your tone, my sweet, Sweet to me now is your tone, But sweeter far will it be When, spoken alone to me, Its silvery notes are free, When we are left alone, my sweet, When we are left alone! When we have wings and are flown, my sweet, When we have wings and are flown, Joy we will have, you and I, Soaring aloft in the sky As twittering twin swallows fly, When we are left alone, my sweet, When we are left alone! Pleasant it is to have known, my sweet, Pleasant it is to have known Friendship and pressure of hands, But brighter the bloom that expands On the spot where Loveliness stands, When we are left alone, my sweet, When we are left alone! Pleasant it is to have sown, my sweet, Pleasant it is to have sown Seeds of friendship on earth, Sweeter by far is the birth Of Beauty's smile, and the mirth Of lips that are left alone, my sweet, Of lips that are left alone! Many a nice old crone, my sweet, Many a nice old crone Has a sweet dim sort of a smile, But the thought of old age is a vile Thing, a sin, a blasphemy, while Young lovers are left alone, my sweet, Young lovers are left alone! Half of it is not known, my sweet, Half of it is not known, Of the happiness that for us waits When the bars are drawn, and the gates Closed, and the hubbub abates, When we are left alone, my sweet, When we are left alone! Pleasant it is to have known, my sweet, Pleasant it is to have known Life and the light of the skies, But sweeter the sight of the eyes Of each other, and soft replies, When we are left alone, my sweet, When we are left alone! Pleasant it is to have grown, my sweet, Pleasant it is to have grown Into the strength of a man, But sweeter than shouts in the van Of the battle the lisp of your fan Waved when we are left alone, my sweet, When we are left alone! Pleasant it is to have thrown, my sweet, Pleasant it is to have thrown Pallor and pain to the winds, Quick drawing up the blinds, Letting in the sun that finds Us when we are left alone, my sweet, When we are left alone! Lone are the birds that moan, my sweet, Lone are the birds that moan, Twain are the birds that sing Making woods and the copses ring Back again with the notes that they fling When two are left alone, my sweet, When two are left alone! Joyful enough to have shown, my sweet, Joyful enough to have shown To ourselves some savours of love Already, but gladness above What She dreams, the wings of my Dove Shall anoint once we are alone, my sweet, Once we are left alone! Once was a time to groan, my sweet, Once was a time to groan When you and I were apart, Severed the halves of our heart, These, they shall cease to smart When we are left alone, my sweet, When we are left alone! Had I a heart of stone, my sweet, Had I a heart of stone, Surely my heart would melt At the thought of the joys we felt, The kisses that each soul dealt When we were left alone, my sweet, When we were left alone! Kisses before were blown, my sweet, Kisses before were blown From the end of a finger tip, But out from the flower of a lip Sweet kisses each shall sip When we are left alone, my sweet, When we are left alone! Know you the source of the Rhone, my sweet, Know you the source of the Rhone, Pure as the skies it goes Till the Arve and its melted snows Are joined, and muddy it flows Henceforth, no longer alone, my sweet, Being left no longer alone! AS ROSES ARE TO JUNE. As sweet you are to me, my love, As roses are to June, As clouds that march in tune To the fair face of the moon, As sweet you are to me, my love, As roses are to June! As dear you are to me, my love, As green to eyes of spring, As boughs of woods that ring To birds therein that sing, As dear you are to me, my love, As green to eyes of spring! As good you are to me, my love, As showers to thirsty ground When drops of healing sound In the summer all around, As good you are to me, my love, As showers to thirsty ground! As fair you are to me, my love, As morning to the air And the ringlets of the hair Of Aurora here and there; As fair you are to me, my love, As morning to the air! As new you are to me, my love, As every dawn is new And the sparkle of the dew Fresh grass that glitters through; As new you are to me, my love, As every dawn is new! As old you are to me, my love, As Beauty to our eyes, To every child that cries For a face, a form, that flies; As old you are to me, my love, As Beauty to our eyes! As young you are to me, my love, As the flush upon the face Of a winner in a race, Or your own lips' grace; As young you are to me, my love, As your own lips' grace! As strong you are to me, my love, As waves are to the sea, And miles of mist that flee To the ether where they be; As strong you are to me, my love, As waves are to the sea! As kind you are to me, my love, As the moon to waves at night, As the radiance of the light Of the sun to waking sight; As kind you are to me, my love, As the moon to waves at night! As true you are to me, my love, As the magnet to the pole, As love to every soul, As stars to seas that roll; As true you are to me, my love, As the magnet to the pole! As white you are to me, my love, As snows upon the heights, And the dazzle of the lights Of Aurora in the nights; As white you are to me, my love, As snows upon the heights! As pure you are to me, my love, As ether's softest breath, Or the gentle hands of Death, As every word Christ saith; As pure you are to me, my love, As every word Christ saith! As fond you are of me, my love, As I am fond of you, Like swallows in the blue We twitter, two and two; As fond you are of me, my love, As I am fond of you! WEEPING ALONE. I saw a maiden weeping aloneâ And the wail of the wind swept by, And clouds clean covered the sky, And never a blade was dry Of the grass by her, weeping alone! I saw a maiden weeping aloneâ Tear-stained face that was fair Once, wind-waved beautiful hair, Sad eyes, how came you there In the wet grass, weeping alone? I saw a maiden weeping aloneâ Head upon hands and knees Huddled up to the head one sees, Look close, and wonderment flees, And pity is left alone! I saw a maiden weeping aloneâ Hair that a man might stroke Strayed, trailed from under a cloak That covers her head from the folk That laugh at a maiden alone! I saw a maiden weeping aloneâ Where is he, what is he like, Has he lifted a sword to strike In the wars, or a ploughboy's pike, And left his sweetheart alone? I saw a maiden weeping aloneâ Where is he, perhaps he is dead, Buried in blood for a bed, With the sod for a pillow instead Of her breast, and she is alone! I saw a maiden weeping aloneâ Where is he, yet it may be He lives, and has left her, and she Will never his false face see Any more, so she weepeth alone! AUGUSTâAN IDYLL. Young they were, and hand in hand Across the fields they wandered, Swiftly passing through the land A wealth of love they squandered That afternoon, when hand in hand They loved, and laughed, and pondered! The August sun across the sheaves Shot slantwise bolts of light, Beneath the nodding golden eaves They sat, till hint of night, With cool hand laid upon the leaves, Brought back to them their sight; Sight gone astray a weary way, The world long left behind That afternoon of August dayâ We know that love is blind, And eyes of those who own his sway The best thing blindness find. Now cooler lips the dews caress, And gentle shadows fall, And fold around the maiden's dress, And homeward lovers call, And back they go, two hearts a-glow, Beside the low grey wall; I do not think that either will In time to come forget One single whisper of the rill, One single leaflet wet That night with dew they wandered through, One waft of mignonette! I think that many a kiss will stay On brow, and eyes, and hand, That many a blithesome breeze will play, And many a wintry strand Be white with snow before they go, These, into Lethe's land! For one such day is brighter far Than years that slowly crawl, And single sight of one such star, Such sight as did befall These two to see, will better be Than constellations all. A SERENADE. Wake, sweet, look to the life of the air, And the scent of the winds below, The moonlit night is in love with the light Of a half-seen shimmer of snow! Draw back the curtainâthy true love stands With eyes that climb and aspire, As the tendrils wind convolvulus-twined, To Beauty on high to be nigher; The scent of the flower-beds all night long Has leave, you know it, to play By your bedside, and why should you chide Feet low on the ground that stay? Let the light of the moon fall soft on an arm By the window-sill sweet shining, Like ivory white set in jet-black bright Stray tresses of hair for a lining; I thought you were fair, I thought you a queen, When I looked on you, love, by day, But little I thought of the radiance brought By night when the sun is away! Your eyes were deep, and I sank therein, But never I thought to swim In a sea so deep, my soul to steep In ecstasy up to the brim! Sweet, blow me a kissâO flowers on high Stretch petals of hands and down To my lips âwith careâ bring its fragrance fair, In love of it life I drown! THRICE! Kiss me once to wash away the past, All the dark and dreary time between Now and when I sadly saw you last Disappear behind the bushes green, Garment fluttering out of eyeshot fast, Kiss me for forgiveness sake, my queen! Kiss me twice, to emphasize the new, This new, blessed, happier, holier time, Clouds have parted, shines again the blue, Rings again the old triumphant rhyme, Peals in either heart a merry chime, Kiss me twice to show that it is true! Kiss me thrice, yea, sweetheart, once again, Think of all I've suffered far away, Think of all the panting and the pain, Bleeding feet that 'mid the briars stray Seeking sight of you from day to day, Signify that I may here remain! SISTERS. YOUNGER SISTER. What is he like, sweet sister mine? I prithee talk to me Of the face and form of that lover of thine, His image I long to see! ELDER SISTER. O sweet my love, he has bonny brown hair, And his eyes are of glistening grey, And his face is a rose, and his feet are fair, And his glance is as bright as day! YOUNGER. And how does he smile, this lover of thine, I have seen you smile at the thought, I have seen you smile, sweet sister mine, Somebody that smile taught! ELDER. He smiles, little bird, as the great Sun smiles In the morning drying the dew, And the glance of his eye falls soft and beguiles An answering eye glance too! YOUNGER. So his hair is brown, sweet sister mine, Does it curl? . . . and his eyes are grey . . . Has he rose-red lips, that lover of thine, Like mine, sweet sister, say? ELDER. Oh sweet, he has lips that I love right well, As rosy, and stronger than thine, For his could be set to encounter hell, Or . . . parted to meet . . . perhaps . . . mine! YOUNGER. And what does he say, sweet sister mine, Does he talk, does he prattle at all, Can he say soft things, this lover of thine, Can he thoughts of thine own forestall? ELDER. Ah! sweet, you should hear him, 'tis not for me To show you, I can't, how he talks . . . . But his voice is as soft as the fall of the sea As close by my side he walks! YOUNGER. And oh! can he kiss, sweet sister mine . . . . I remember at school we agreed That nobody should be a lover of thine If he couldn't . . . in this succeed! ELDER. Ah! love, one day you will know for yourself What a kiss from a hero means . . . . Why, sister mine, you sly little elf, You are not yet in your teens! YOUNGER. Shall I have, do you think, sweet sister mine, When I grow as tall as you, And as pretty . . . perhaps . . . such a lover as thine, A lover shall I have too? ELDER. Yes, little sister, keep you still And be content to abide, Eyes now full of fun one day shall fill With tears when he walks by your side. YOUNGER. What is it like, sweet sister mine, What they call being in love? Was he in love, that lover of thine, When he kissed . . . I saw . . . your glove? ELDER. Sweet, it is fair beyond all our dreams, And gentle as airs at night, And softer than wave of a symphony seems That lulls one asleep with delight. YOUNGER. Can he laugh, can he smile, sweet sister mine, Or is he stern, does he frown, This bearded man, this lover of thine, As he bends his high head down? ELDER. Aye, he can laugh, little sister mine, He can laugh, and his laugh is sweet, Thrilling the veins as a draught of wine, As the wild wind thrills the wheat. YOUNGER. And aren't you sorry, sweet sister mine, From me, from us all to part, To leave us all for that lover of thine, To give to him your young heart? ELDER. Sorry, my sweet, as the flowers that give To the sun their scents in the morn, As the crimson clouds that for one thing live Their colour to give to the dawn. YOUNGER. But is he worth it, sister mine, Is he worthy . . . worthy of you . . . If he is the sun, that lover of thine, You are something better than dew! ELDER. Worthy . . . aye . . . we will not talk, sweet, Of worth, if you please, any more, Precious to me is the print of his feet, And the sound of his step at the door. YOUNGER. Has he ever told you, sister mine, That he loved you, loved you at all, Has he spoken out, that lover of thine, Did he ever at your feet fall? ELDER. Never, love, but he said, âMy own,â And I . . . I knew what he meant . . . I . . . why I know each turn of his tone . . . And . . . home together we went! YOUNGER. Ah! together . . . sweet sister mine, I remember now very well How you and he, that lover of thine, Came home as the night mists fell. ELDER. Ah! I remember too, little love, And the dews and the darkening trees, And pale clear skies and a sparkle above Of the stars, and the balm of the breeze. THE SONG OF THE LONELY SOUL. I live my life in a lonely land Without the sound of a smile, Pacing a desolate twilight strand, Gnawing my heart with a file Of memories iron, a heaped-up band, Like waves that the wild winds pile All together, en masse, pell-mell, Writhing like crested snakes, Opening depths of a foam-flecked hell, Filling the air with flakes That ride, like witches, right out of the well Where each upon each wave breaks; Such are the miseries strong to assail Heart and being of mine, Thrashing the wheat of one's mind with a flail That leaves no time to repine, For blows are rapid, and coats of mail Would be only as twisted twine Before the force of it; not to kill Outright are the blows of it bent, Only to torture, only to spill Warm blood from the veins of us rent As runs from a rock rod-stricken a rill, It seems as if it were sent! If there is Purpose what care we? What matter if there is none? For then, as it seems, the sooner the sea Drowns out the light of the sun, And swamps in water all things that be The sooner will Death be done! If there is Love, though not for us, Yet it is well to abideâ If there is Beauty, we'll not discuss Result of our own life's ride, But cease, like waves from foam, from the fuss Of the ages and calm subside; If there is none there is nothing at all, All things that are, are not, The Universe crumbles beneath a pall Of rottenness, silences hot To blast with their breath us weak worms fall On us, being from being to blot. IT'S ALL GONE AWAY. It's all gone away, The light of the day, Now skies are gray, And closed are the eyes Of Love, hope flies, But miseries stay! Never again Shall it be as when Strength as of ten Was ours in the flower Of life, and the power Of manifold men! Weak as the grass Limbs of us pass Brittle as glass To the grave that waits With a grin on its gatesâ Life is a farce, Only without Laughter, and shout Of delight, and the pout Of lips that admire The actors' fire, And sparkle about; Left of the fun Of the play there is none, Never a pun In the drama of life To lighten the strife With a ray of the sun; Slowly we go All of a row, Roses that blow, And flowers that are faded, To the churchyard shaded By tombs that grow; What does it matter? Earth is the fatter, Beauty we scatter All over the ground, Soon to be found In the worms' wet platter; Lips are in bloom Ripe for the gloom Of a sunless tomb, And flowers are fairâ We fix them there For decay to consume; The younger the better For death the setter Of plants, the abettor Of grey grave-mists And skeletons kissed By the clank of a fetter; Bloom upon cheeks For a timeâtill leaks Life's can, and he seeks With slow sad strides Like a ghost that glides Death's pitiless peaks; Upon these he sits, And Loveliness flits, And they are at quits, Sad Life and Deathâ Life gives us breath, Our throats Death slits! MY LOVE. MEDIÃVAL. My Love is as the rose, her lips Are sweeter than the buds the bee In booming condescension sips, Each stray of hair that sideways slips, Is dearer than ten crowns to me. My Love is as the lily, white And pure and passionate, lithe and tall, I dream of her the livelong night, And see her towering, golden bright, Beside the old grey garden wall. My Love is as the violet, Most fair and modest, in the shade She sits, 'tis long since we have met, Aud therefore both my eyes are wet, And all my heart in motion made. My Love is as the meadow-sweet, The odour of her hair is good, And round about her passing feet Enchanted flowers you may meet, The grass is green where she hath stood. My Love is as the golden corn, Her hair it waveth in the wind, Before her face delight is born; Attendant roses of the dawn Behind her footstep you may find. ACROSS THE SEA. Across the sea, across the strand, My Lady waved a snow-white hand, A farewell token to the land, A farewell gift to me, Across the strand, across the sea, My Lady sent a sign to me, Twain lovers that should parted be, My lady sent a hand! Across the waves, across the foam, She hurled a hasty hand-shake home, About to rove, about to roam, About to leave my side, Across the foam, across the waves, White intermediate heaving graves, A look the wind and water braves, The last glance of my bride! Across the sea, across the strand, My Lady waved a snow-white hand, By backward breezes forward fanned, By blithesome breezes home, Across the strand, across the sea, She sent a joyous sign to me, A sign that shortly she would be Returned, no more to roam! Across the waves, across the waste, My Lady came in gladsome haste, Blown kisses each the other chased, Blown kisses sent to me, Across the waste, across the waves, Across the lapping sea that laves The ship's keel, comes my Queen and saves, Praise Heaven, my memory! THREEâONLY THREE. Oh, love, give me a kiss, Oneâonly one, To be the beginning of bliss, The first soft ray of the sun, The last wave wind being done, Last step a race being run, Grant me, sweetheart, this, Oneâonly one! Twoâonly two, To kiss each other, and be Twin kisses clinging to me Like seaweed washed in the sea, Or drops of delicate dew, Twoâonly two! Threeâonly three, That I may remember, sweet, How your heart with my heart beat, And the rapid pulse of your feet When you came to give to me Threeâonly three! VICTOR HUGO INSIDE PARIS. âI pity you who are with the kings who kill;â So said he, Victor Hugo, and prepared In the arms of that sweet city they had dared To threaten, aged blood of his to spill, As if her kisses, youthful, he had shared. âI pity you who are with the kings who kill, But me to minister to a people dying It suits, and in the rear of Terror flying, And in the van of Hope that forward will Advance, to end a life of absent sighing; âOf lonely sighing far apart from her My own sweet city, yea, my love, my queen, I come to end the years that rolled between Us, and my body to inter Within the walls where long my soul hath been. âAt a most supreme moment I return When Freedom re-established on the throne A chant triumphant ending in a groan Is singing, one hand pointing to an urn, The other to a despotism flown! âOne hand is pointing to the sunset skies Where sinks, but not this time in seas of blood, Napoleon's sun that high in heaven stood But yesterday, and held her for a prizeâ And here my Lady hath the thing she would; âBut with the other to the raging hordes Of mad barbarians marching to her gates To wreak on lips inviolate their hates She points, and summons garniture of swords, And lovers' breasts to meet the fickle fates. âAnd shall she make to any one in vain, To any one of us, her last appeal, Crowned with a kiss to each for woe or weal, A kiss that either lips of Death retain, Or else that rosy Victory's mouth may seal?â AT NIGHT. Come to where the waters play Underneath the moon, See the honeysuckle spray Beckons softly, answer âyea,â You will be obedient, eh, You will join me soon? Come to where the sands are light And the breezes cool, O, my sweet one, shining white At the window, we will write Names upon the beach to-night, We will play at âschool!â I had, when I wrote this, the exquisite love-scene in poor Robertson's drama of âSchoolâ in my mind. Come to where I wait for you, Where I wait and sing, Breathe upon me as the dew Gently fans the grasses through, Strength exhausted to renew, Health of heaven to bring. ANSWER. No, Sir, you were cross to-day, Ah, I saw you frown, 'Tis too cold to-night to play, Listen honeysuckle spray, Hear my answer, take my âNay,â Winding woodwork down. I am cross to-night as wellâ Sir, what did you mean Praising so that faded belle, Really I can hardly tellâ Here a pouting rosebud fell Lifted eyes between; Played the waters, played the pair On the shining sands. He was handsome, she was fair, Love was rosy, he was there, Well the three contented were, Closely clasped their hands. BREAKERS THREE. The bells are chiming loud to-night, A sight they suggest to me Of a foam-flecked ocean surface white, A passionate heaving sea, And a boat with wings to flee The following waters' glee To the harbour beacon bright; Or, a wood with one beside, Dear, very dear to me, In a leafy, laughing, deep green tide The boughs and twigs of a tree Wave over us graciously As I upon bended knee Beseech her to be my bride; Or, a sandy desolate shore With pale grey thistles to me Face turning evermore, Low green cliffs on our lee, And a heart that seems to be As heavy as breakers three That follow and burst and roar. TWO TOGETHER! Easy 'tis for two together Rainy skies to face, Roughest bursts of windy weather, All alone to pace Needs a heart as hard as leather, 'Tis a sorry case! I have seen the clouds unfolding When four eyes were there, Clouds that only now were holding Over one poor pair Pitiless thunder-symptoms, scolding Copper sheets of air. I have seen the scent of flowers Freshen and expand, Glad to greet united powers, Glad to greet a hand Robbing blossom-laden bowers At a soft command. I have seen a shower hurry, Haste to leave the skies, Cloudy masses in a flurry, Thunderstorm that flies, All for fear a crash might worry, Drown two lovers' sighs! I have seen the ether brighten All from side to side, And the sunshine smile and lighten Like as if it tried All the universe to whiten For some bonny bride! I have seen the roses blushing Into deeper red, Beauty over lilies rushing, Bloom intenser shed When two lovers' cheeks were flushing Over every head, Every gentle head of flower, 'Faith they seem to share With us some mysterious power, Hand in hand to fare Along with us, glad gifts to shower Upon a happy pair! ALONE! Alone! alone! What does it mean? Has any one seen The last rose-queen Of the Autumn blown? She is left alone. Alone! alone! The last brave man In the rear, in the van The foremost, can Tell, must have known, What it is to be lone. Alone! alone! A love-sick maid Who fingers a braid Of hair that he played With often, is shown The grief of the lone. Alone! alone! A mother, whose sons In the war by the guns Are standing, stuns The trumpet's tone, For, she is alone. Alone! alone! An old man grey Who has lived his day Who has played his play, Now feeble grown Sits sadly alone. Alone! alone! A bird in its nest Who misses the breast That it loves the best, For a mate makes moan, Is indeed alone. Alone! alone! A lover who sighs For the light of the eyes Of his mistress, cries With a vehement groan I am alone. WHEN SUNS ARE BRIGHT. When suns are bright, And life's before you, And breezes o'er you Are floating light, Nor miseries gnaw you, Launch forth your bark, And sail the seas, Inhale the breeze, Till dawn of dark And nights that freeze; Sing in the blue, Like happy birds, And leap as herds Are wont to do When morning girds Her belt of beautyâ Soon to pass Like gathered grass Some hot hand's booty, Or broken glass; Love while you may, It is not long That lasts a song, An hour of play, A life of wrong, A gaze in eyes, A broken heart, An Ã¦on's smart, And shattered lies Life's every part, A sigh, a kiss, And all is gone And hope is borne On wings of bliss To lands forlorn: Where desert sands Stretch dreary plains, And flower of pains Alone expands, Alone remains! Was this thing meant For us to see And not to flee, When we were sent Alive to be? That we should sigh The livelong day, And weep for play, For gladness cry, Nor wish to stay; That we should love The life of flowers, And rose-hung bowers, And clouds above, And summer showers, And softest airs Of twilight lands, And lonely sands Where Beauty fares, And Mystery stands, And inland scenes, And wealth of woods With waving hoods Of varied greens That reach for roods, And moors' expanse, Where bells of heather In windy weather And fern-leaves dance In joy together, And sweeping hills, Where winds are free And kissed in glee The leaping rills The breezes fleeâ I cannot tell Why these are glad, But we are sadâ Why we a hell, These heaven had? AH, WELL-A-DAY! Ah, well-a-day! Man is a worm, Weak and infirm, A blossomless germ Woven of clayâ Ah, well-a-day! Ah, well-a-day! Woman is a dream, A stray rose-beam From the sunset stream, One red rayâ Ah, well-a-day! Ah, well-a-day! Love is the light Of an hour, in the night It fails us quite, Never does it stayâ Ah, well-a-day! Ah, well-a-day! What is the bloom Of youth worth? gloom And moss on a tomb Is the end of the wayâ Ah, well-a-day! Ah, well-a-day! Beauty of lips The young man sips Death's hand snips With his scissors, I sayâ Ah, well-a-day! Ah, well-a-day! Best to be gone, Not to be born, To be left forlorn In the womb of the clayâ Ah, well-a-day! Ah, well-a-day! Beauty of a rose No man knows Till the best part goes, Till the cankers slayâ Ah, well-a-day! Ah, well-a-day! Best for us all Like leaves to fall, And escape from the thrall Of our garments grayâ Ah, well-a-day! Ah, well-a-day! Flowers are sweet, And lips that meet, But swift are the feet Of the flails that flayâ Ah! well-a-day! Ah, well-a-day! Come, let us turn, Strong souls that burn, To the face of the Urn, Strong souls that strayâ Ah, well-a-day! Ah, well-a-day! Sweet was the hair, And the face was fair Of Beauty, but where Is she gone to, pray? Ah, well-a-day! Ah, well-a-day! The world is mad, We are all of us sad, We are most of us bad, We are weak to delayâ Ah, well-a-day! Ah, well-a-day! There is a childâ See, he has smiled! Bricks he has piled In a heap at his playâ Ah, well-a-day! Ah, well-a-day! Few men know Where spring-buds blow, And the birth of the snow That blossoms in Mayâ Ah, well-a-day! Ah, well-a-day! All men see Agony, and fleeâ Why should we be At all, if we pay Such a penalty, eh? GOOD-NIGHT! Good-night, my sweet one, sleep attend you, And bear you into dreamland on his wings, Into a mist of soft sights send you, Where not a single bird there is but sings, Happiness higher than the day's is lend you, And eyes that revel in the midst of things, From which, alas! the light will rend you In spite of memory that backward clings. MY LOVE. MEDIÃVAL. My Love is of the summer, she Is bound about her brow with hair As golden as the sun-lit air Upon a base of porphyry; A summer Queen she seems to be, Her feet caress the grasses fair, And they in turn obeisance bear, And blossoms bend before her knee; She hath a wondrous way with me, She glances at me, and I wear A silent mien, content to share Her sweet complaisant company. My Love is of the autumn, she Hath black-brown hair and subtle eyes, Green as the green-grey Northern skies, Her face is good for man to see; I strove, alas! I failed to flee, As effort flutters down and dies Like a shot swallow, and low lies, So I succumbÃ¨d quietly; With meadow-sweet and fern did we In Love's unending Folly wise Make garlands, weave together ties That left me shorn of liberty. My Love is of the spring-time, she Is gentle as the opening flowers, And lays a sense of cooling showers Upon a forehead fever-free; Under an Elm's gigantic lee We sat and laughed aside the hours With pouting time-regardless powers, And tears of changing ecstasy; She hath blue eyes, she hath the key To open green May-scented bowers, She hath the songs of birds for dowers, And nosegays folded full of glee. My Love is of the winter, she Is queen of the dim blue-gray land Where the auroral streamers stand, And, roseate, stride across the sea; The daughter of the winter, he Her cheeks with bitter frosts hath fanned, And made my Lady keen-eyed, and Next beautiful in turn to thee My Goddess of the graces three Who hast the autumn to command, And hast the eyes so subtly planned, Holding three separate shades in fee. MISCELLANEOUS PIECES. THE FIRST. As dreams at morning fly And leave no trace behind, When we draw up the blind, To the limbo of mists consigned, So when to thee I sigh Cleared are the clouds of my mindâ Cleared are the clouds of my mind, Breaks forth and shines the blue Wet dismal fog-damps through, Slays fancies false the true, And faces false I find Fly before thought of you. O darling do not leave My side, or I shall die, To you my soul doth cry, To you my heart doth fly, For loss of you I grieve As the flowers at sunset sigh; Come back at least in dreams, And let me see your face, If but for some short space, And let my fancy trace Deep hair of thine that gleams, Ringlets that interlace; Come to me when you canâ As sighs for the scent of the rose Air where a rosebud blows I sigh, my wings I close, They hang down weak and wan, My life-stream stagnant flows, O sweet, come, quicken the life In my veins, make roses blow, Melt sad white widths of snow, Bid gladsome streamlets flow Till all the air is rife With melody, freed from woe; As for me I am weary, I lie and think of you And paint a likeness true, As songbirds love the blue Bright skies I love you dearie, Each dawn my love is new; As songbirds hate the winter, Short days and nights that freeze, No flowers and leafless trees, As songbirds cease the breeze With shafts of song to splinter, So am I ill at ease, Sick, silent, when we're parted, Unhappy till we meet, Till sound of some one's feet Is heard, and hands that greet Make whole the heart that smarted, Rebuild the broken street; Sweet love, I cannot say Though I try the things I wouldâ Ah! if I only could, If at your feet I stood The gift of a voice one day Made mine, sweet, then you should Know what your Beauty means, And how my heart is riven, And how in vain I've striven To reach the heights of Heaven With pen that only gleans Stray ears, through Earth's fields driven; I find my life flow sadly, And many a stagnant pool Is there, and breezes cool Are absent, 'tis the rule It seems for daytime badly And night to use their tool; But if your life flows gladly Something that is to know, Then all things are not woe, And grass beneath the snow Is green yet, and less madly Our pulses come and go; If Beauty is, and you, sweet, Are Beautiful, 'tis well! The cold and fires of hell Have not sufficed to quell All things, and your white feet, Unsinged, the good news tell; Be perfect; let your Beauty Bud, blossom, like a rose, Straight as a rose-tree grows Rise, proud and pure as snows, The sons of men for booty To you Fate, smiling, throws; And all I claimâI do claim This muchâis right of place; I was the first to trace In dust before your face My form, the first that came, The foremost in the race, First lover of them all, The first to speak your praise, The first a psalm to raise With heart and lips a-blaze Fast bound in Beauty's thrall, The first your Beauty slays! ONE TRESS. I should have liked one tressâoneâonly oneâ One sea-soft ripple of the black-brown hair, One ray from off the circle of the sun, One leaf from out a flowering forest fair, Surely, sweet lady mine, 'twere no harm done Of wealth so wide a mite with me to share; One drop from out the Great Wide World of Water, One crystal blade from fields of ether torn, One distant dimple of a smile, O daughter, One blush from off the crimson face of morn, One soft sweet echo of thy low love-laughter, One pearl-pink petal pouted from a rose, One wingÃ¨d word of answer, silence after, One star from all the galaxies of snows, One look of love, one pressure of a hand, One sparkle flashed from out an answering eye, One grain from all the silted seas of sand, One point of light from blue expanse of sky, One rosy foam-flower flung from out the Ocean Fair as Queen Venus, when she rose, new-born, One gentle message of a hand in motion All fraught with hopefulness for love forlorn, One whisper of the wind on summer mornings Waking a glad re-echo in the leaves, One ripple of laughter rung from under awnings Merry maidens shading on soft summer eves, One moonbeam shining silvery o'er the billows Amid the bewildering witchery of the night, One delicate dream-tune played about our pillows, One ray, one pure white shaft of morning light, One echo of a symphony suggesting Delicious dreams in rainbow raiments dressed, One glimpse of hope of somewhere, sometime, resting And sinking into sleep, and being blest, One distant tiny tinkle of remembrance, Preserved through all the sights and sounds of morn, Of some fair vision, without form or semblance, Amid the misty dim dream-valleys born, One flame plucked off the pyre of sunset fires, One feather fallen from out an eagle's wing, One waft of melody seized from off the lyres Of all the Universe of Birds that sing, One flake of foam blown off the ocean ridges, One rattle in the rowlocks of an oar, One winglet waving in a mist of midges, One shell from all the lone Atlantic shore, One silent memory of seasons golden When life and love went hand in hand together, One glance a fearful follower to embolden, One whistle of wind aloft in winter weather; One rosy flush a fair face overflowing, One honeysuckle-scented wave of air, One lightning flash the landscape sudden showing, One look, its owner only half-aware, Right to the heart of hearts of some one going, For him a life or death-doom to declareâ All these seem small things, ladyâI ask less, For I only ask of thee one tiny tress. MY LOVE. My love is waiting by the seaâ By sloped long hillocks of dun sand With grey-green grasses clothed, a land Most lonely, there she chose to standâ Most grievous, there she chose to beâ My love is waiting by the sea! My love is waiting in the woodâ Beneath her feet the flowers are red And yellow, over her sweet head The falling fluttered leaves are shed, She wears her hair, she wears no hood, My love is waiting in the wood! My love is waiting at the gateâ A rose she holds between her hands, And, silent, smiling down she stands, Her hair in braids of golden bands Hangs downward by its own glad weight, My love is waiting at the gate! My love is waiting in the laneâ The honeysuckle stoops inclined To kiss her, of an equal mind With me, the roses blush to find Their rivalry of redness vain, My love is waiting in the lane! My love is waiting on the shoreâ The waves are plashing at her feet, Soft music this, but not so sweet As low desire of lips that meet, Once having met to meet the more, My love is waiting on the shore! My love is waiting by the streamâ Ah, sweet o ne, fast the waters flow, Our joy is fleeting even so, A moment's mute delight we know, A moment's wild ecstatic dream, Andâlove's no longer by the stream! My love is waiting nigh the lakeâ Sweet pebbles, rounded water-stones She stands upon, I would my bones Were even as ye, I would my groans A sacrifice her feet might take, That love would slay me by the lake! My love is waiting in the roadâ And up and down she looks and weeps, My coldness at a distance keeps, For what she, cruel, sowed she reaps, She mocked me when my own heart glowed, I leave her weeping in the road! My love is waiting by the treesâ Those fair four trees where first we met, I have them in my memory yet, She waits, she sigheth for regret, And I burn round her in the breeze, And breathe upon her through the trees! My love is waiting in the streetâ We are not rich, we envy not The wealthy, ours a lowly lot, But she, she loveth me, God wot! And therefore are my footsteps fleet To meet my lady in the street! My love is waiting by the burnâ A Scottish maiden she, and I A Scotchman born as such to die Am steadfast, O the soft blue eye, The yellow hair, the lips I earn As greeting, coming nigh the burn! My love is waiting by the brookâ The peppermint and forget-me-not Make sweet and gracious all the spot, But as for me my lips are hot, My eyes are eager, and I look For heaven and her beside the brook! My lady waiteth on the hillâ And I, I weep, I cannot move, I cannot go to meet my love, I strive below, she sings above, Bound fast by fate's remorseless will I cannot cry, nor climb the hill! My love is waiting in the gladeâ And over her the branches bow And make a green cathedral now With waving aisles, across her brow A soothing shadow next have laid, And so she waits within the glade! My love is waiting on the beachâ High green cliffs on the dexter hand Enclose us from the inward land, And on the left the billows band Together in a foamy reach, And laugh, as we do, on the beach! My love is waiting by the elmâ In France, a lonely sun-struck spot With poplars lined that waver not In straightness, in the mid-day hot She chose with fire to overwhelm My parched pale soul beside the elm! My love is waiting by the bridgeâ A country bridge with mosses grown Across a babbling streamlet thrown, And she and I were there alone, Alone we walked the wooded ridge, And, after, rested on the bridge! My love is waiting far awayâ In Italy underneath the blue A sculptor's work I have to do But I can only image you, For you possess me, night or day, Although you are so far away! My love is waiting in the townâ In London, and I try to write âDramatic Poems,â failing quite, She lays her hands across my sight, And what she wills I must put down, My queen, and queen of London town! My love is waiting on the heathâ Sweet upland, would that I were there, That nostrils drank the scented air Of furze, and feet the fingering fair Of heather felt, a foxglove wreath I'd weave for love upon the heath! My love is waiting in the valeâ I have not seen her since I went On fame's achievement strongly bent To the wars, my soul in sunder rent, One half she holds, that maiden pale, Of a soldier's heart hid in the vale! My love is waiting on the mountâ Beneath the rocks, above the vines That grow in green trim-trellised lines She sits, and slowly sadly pines, As I pine, and the hours count Until I stand on that Swiss mount! My love is waiting in the nightâ Dark-eyed, a sweet signora face, With the old unequalled southern grace Of figure, in the market place Against the carven pillar, white She leans and shineth through the night! My love is waiting by the bayâ The Ganges rolls long brown-lipped waves, And her bare feet their whisper laves, Their broken whisper, just as saves Each kiss a keener word to say, A closer lip-caress next day! My love is waiting in the Northâ I see her, she hath green-grey eyes, And something of the serpent lies Within those deep bewildering skies, Whence witchery lightens, ceaseless, forth The Auroral lustre of the North! My love is waitingâfond of me She is, at least she was last year, Who knows, I may not now be dear, We are parted, shall I shed a tear? Come, sweet one, if I weep for thee At least a half tear drop for me! My love is waiting where I left Her lastâand let her wait awhile, For when I wept she did but smile, Now let her sorrow and beguile As best she may, from love's lips reft, The time, for laughed-at love has left! My love is waitingâis it so, And doth she wait and look for me? As seeks an old sweet flower a bee, So will I flutter unto thee, The unforgotten lips to know Again I tasted long ago! My love is waiting in a dreamâ Come, sleep, and close the daylight gates, And where my golden-haired one waits Robed in the delicate mystic states Of dreamland, let my presence seem, And let me join her in a dream! My love is waiting in the mornâ Her face is in the rosy flush, The beatific sunrise blush, And out the gay-eyed memories gush, The tinted clouds night left forlorn, To meet my mistress in the morn! My love is waiting at the eveâ The golden sunset gleams away Its glory into simple gray, The rose-hued raptures where are they, Is nought left but to sigh and grieve, And mourn our midday merged in eve? My love is waiting in the breezeâ A fairy she, with wings outspread She hovers round about my head, And in each shower of leaves is shed Upon me, sighs from out the trees, And rustles gently in the breeze! My love is waiting by the boatâ The ripples rise, advance, and flee, My lady's foot is stayed for me, And golden all across the sea The sunset splendours fall and float, My love is waiting by the boat! My love is waiting at the moundâ Grey, desolate, in a lonely place, With granite boulders leaving space For fern and heaths that interlace, A witch-like, strange, enchanted ground, With Fairy Love upon the mound! My love is waiting by the hedgeâ Under her feet the laughing blue Wild speedwell peep the grasses through, And white stars glisten two and two Along the ivy-tangled edge Of that sweet spring-time trysting hedge! My love is waiting in the skyâ At sunrise towards her face I turn, At sunset towards her lips I yearn, And all the livelong day I burn To win me wings of death, and fly To her I long for in the sky! My love is waiting far behindâ One kiss, one whisper, only one, And with the setting slanting sun Her lifeâmy life as wellâwas done, And henceforth here death's face I find, Love's warm embrace being left behind! My love is waiting in a cloudâ A cloud of memory, mute and wet With raindrops of grey gone regret, That shall be slashed with rainbow yet, As the sun turns a winter shroud Of mist into a red-lipped cloud! My love is waiting where the moon Casts all across a dim grey waste Of waves and sand by waters chased A pale-gold shimmer, and I haste To wake her from that cold sad swoon Beneath the unsympathizing moon! My love is waiting where the sun Burns vehement, and the distant hills With azure mist-enchantment fills, I wait to learn the thing she wills, She waits to see her work well done, She in the shade, I 'neath the sun! My love is waiting, and I go To lay upon her lips a kiss Including all the passion this My song hath seized, no note I miss, No pang of the melody, tear or throe, When my own mistress' mouth I know! YET HOW FAIR! God saw the world that he had made, and its beauty swept across his soul like a sudden scent of summer in the air, like the sound of distant music, like the melody of the wings of the wind, and he leaned his head upon his hands and wept. Yet how fair! For all the sweeping agony of rain That bars the windows of the day with pain At night, behold! the moon peeps forth again With golden hair, This world of ours is woeful, yet how fair! Yet how fair! To-day her words are cruel, and her eyes Shake all the summer glory of the skies Into the sieve of sadness, and low lies Her lover in despair, Wicked is she who wounds him, yet him fair! Yet how fair! In all the reckless splendour of his youth He rides his horse-hoofs over trampled truth, And gives for gladness to a maiden ruth, And sorrow for her share, Ignoble is his presence, yet how fair! Yet how fair! The long melodious laughter of the storm Across a seething waste of billows borne When shipwrecked heart from heart asunder torn Shrieks everywhere, Wild is the winter weather, yet how fair! Yet how fair! The simple lines of softly smiling lips That hold a rosebud unto him that sips Their sweetness, that a sudden shudder nips And freezeth there, Thrice treacherous are they, brother, yet how fair! Yet how fair! The burning flow of vowels that deceive, That wrap a heart in flames they mean to leave, And such a marvellous web of witchery weave, So soft a lair, Kindled at hell the words are, yet how fair! Yet how fair! When on some sick St. Anthony peepeth in A face whose fire might tempt a saint to sin, Braided with sighs of souls she seeks to win, She seeks to tear, Wicked is she who tempts him, yet how fair! Yet how fair! The world is heavy with the weight of snows, And only here and there we find a rose, And up and down the wheel of fortune goes, And hard to bear Her folly, she is fickle, yet how fair! Yet how fair! The summer morning wet with woven dews On all the grass not one of us can choose But love, though unto him the day refuse A flower to wear, The summer day is selfish, yet how fair! Yet how fair! The gentle moonlight cast across the sheaves, Though in the midst there sits a soul that grieves, Whose heart is shaken like the autumn leaves, To blossom ne'er Again in this world, bitter, yet how fair! Yet how fair! The silvery night that takes a maid away For whom a mother somewhere strives to pray, The silvery night in arms of which they stray A passionate pair, The night it is that wiles them, yet how fair! Yet how fair! An early morning in the woods of spring When like young leaves so easily they clingâ Those kissesâand the afternoons that sting, That would repair With sadness over-gladness, yet how fair! Yet how fair! The bloom and pouting petals of a rose, Though not a man of us there is but knows That bloom is for a season, after goes, And goeth where? Thrice bitter is its beauty, yet how fair! Yet how fair! A little hand that waves a man to follow, A wafted sigh that, foolish, he must swallow, A glance that leads him over hill and hollow, Swift to ensnare, A simple thing is each one, yet how fair! Yet how fair! The white face of a hero lying dead, Over each cheek of his a pale rose shed, Death's bosom bent to pillow him instead Of heart of her Who would have died to save him, yet how fair! Yet how fair! The very rubbing off of early bloom, Yea, and the threatening terror of the tomb, Yea, and the steady coming on of gloom An end to declare Of all things, bitter is it, yet how fair! Yet how fair! The laughing eyes of maidenhood the while Their sole success is knowing how to smile, Although we feel that teeth of time will file, His fingers pare The softest apple-blossom, yet how fair! Yet how fair! The weary years, the years that come and go And crown their sad departure, each, with snow, For each to some gay heart has given a glow, A kindled glare Of happiness, they hasten, yet how fair! Yet how fair! The softest sighs of air that steal between Downbending tracery of branches green Where lovers' feet are often standing seen, Though frosts should dare To nip the leaves in winter, yet how fair! Yet how fair! The foam flakes showered all across the blue, On mornings when the wind is wailing through The rigging, and a pair of lovers true Their fealty swear, The sea's an arch deceiver, yet how fair! Yet how fair! The very ecstasy that drags us down, The very wild delirium of the crown A smile can weave, and fling to earth a frown, A motion scare, Sweet is it, fleeting is it, yet how fair! Yet how fair! The dreams that wave their sleepy wings at night And scatter, scared at advent of the light, To leave us unfledged, after visions bright Fast held of care, Deceitful are they, dangerous, yet how fair! Yet how fair! The whole of things, the ecstasy that drains The panting soul till not a drop remains, Till pleasure's flower ripens into pains, Till eyelids stare, Till happiness is heavy, yet how fair! Yet how fair! In spite of all, the Universal Glow, In spite of all the streets on fire with woe And faces pale and haggard all-a-row, Though to prepare Reaction runs the feeling, yet how fair! THE BRIGAND'S LETTER. Founded, literally, on a letter purporting to have been written by one of the Greek Brigands to his wife on the eve of his execution. I do not know whether the reported letter was true or not, but it was quite beautiful enough to be true. âI cherish the sweet hope she will not marry, Marry again, my love, my dark-eyed queen, It may be memory of a man will tarry In heart of hers when I am bruised between The sudden folding doors of violent death; I charge you, therefore, brother, safe to carry Words wafted by her husband's dying breath; If aught there were that yet for me could parry The silent stress of agony that awaits My soul approaching close Death's darksome gates It were to know that she, my love, were true, The grave being found too feeble to undo The silken love-knot twined around us two, Made strong for both by fingers of the Fates; But if she should be all too weak to wait To meet me at Death's lonely garden-gate, Let it be soâ I lay no vows upon her; Let all my gifts of happy olden time In such case still be hers, with this my rhyme, My wreath of death-song, last of all I'd don her! But take away, sweet brother mine, and keep, The ring I gave her with my name therein, If so be she, my queen, should count so cheap The heart that once she thought it wealth to win, Because it beats beneath the groundâI love her! And wings of mine may, who knows, wave above her, And, if she but be true, we may discover Some gate by which to Heaven to enter in!â A LITANY FOR THE USE OF THE MEN WHOM THE CHURCHES HAVE IN THIS AGE CAST OUT. God, God, what does it all mean, All this agony of being? Surely, Thou dost not rejoice Mankind's misery in seeing? Send us some sound of a voice, Send us some avenue of fleeing. If there is Purpose in the pain, Scourge, till we faint beneath the rod, Waken us, and scourge us again; If Thou art our Mother O God, Not one of us will complain, Hell we will traverse unshod. Beauty is the thing that we requireâ Beautiful if Thou canst make Us men and women by fire, Then over us fires rake, Such is thy children's desire, They will not blench neither quake. Heat we can bear and the pain of it, Cold of the ice-cold lake, Are we assured of the gain of it, Souls in our hands we will take, If we suspect but the bane of it, Limbs of us quiver and shake. One thing Thou lovest and mortals, Beautyâand Goodness and Truth; Towards these open Thou the portals, Spare not, make away with ruth, So that to us in the end falls Beauty of Holiness in sooth. Purposeless pain we outcry at, He were a Fiend not a God, He that should issue his fiat For application of the rod Only for torture, we sigh at But love not the might of his nod. Nay if He be, we defy Him, Turning to worship a man, Some one, the best we can find, He that is least of us blind, Strongest, and purest of mind, With Godhead at once we supply him. But, if Thou art, O our Lord, And if Thou lovest us, wellâ Lead us through horrors of hell, World-wide conflagrations to quell, As sheep follow a bell We will follow the flame of Thy sword. HYMN AT SUNRISE OF THE THEISTIC âPILGRIM FATHERSâ LANDING ON THE SHORE OF A NEW FAITHâ THEIR âTE DEUM LAUDAMUS.â At Last, thank God, the watchers on the mountains Tell us that far off flush the streaks of dawn, Again are flowing long-forgotten fountains, From out the ether long-lost sounds are born, On all sides round about us are appearing Signs, and faint flowers of Thought not seen before, And hope there is that we at last are steering Our Planet Vessel to the looked-for shore, That all these weary centuries of waiting At last, it may be, quicken to an end, And rolls the Race towards its final state in That groove in which its way it has to wend Through all the glorious future harvest years When tree of life of ours its blossom bears; When sons of men who long have been enduring, Waiting the sunrise, bound in bitter thrall, Eyes bent upon the ground, their heads obscuring With poured-out ashes, faces to the wall, These, who endured the agony of anguish, And all the strain and struggle of the fight, Sweet pale girl faces, prisoners who languish Peeping between the prison bars of night, And all that mighty host in tribulation Now longing, well nigh hopeless, for the morn, Shall feel at last a thrill of jubilation As sounds from out the foremost watcher's horn Signal that in the east the morning sun To assail the realms of darkness has begun; Shall raise their heads, and looking each to other, Each holding out to each a happy hand, Say, âDreams of ours are over, sister, brother, At last upon the continent we stand, Awake, firm-footed, finding things we dreamed of In daylight wear an even happier hue, Finding the things our hearts the surer seemed of Are verily the truest of the true, Finding that better after all is daylight And pale blue skies and breezes of the morn Than dreams engendered by the broken stray light From clouded moon-rays o'er the ocean borne To us the humble watchers upon earth For the Great Planet of the Future's birth; âThe higher were the thoughts of us aforetime The purer and the truer now they seem, The sorrows undergone in our sad sore time Like smoking torches far behind us gleam Just marking the old margin of the darkness And making clearer light in which we stand, Of agony if we had had one spark less Our lanterns had not lasted to the land And we had lingered on, for ever moaning Across the billows of an angry sea, Wind blowing off the foam of our strong groaning Without a haven into which to flee, But now, secure upon the Sacred Shore, We laugh at waves that mocked at us before; âAnd ah God! how we love our friends and brothers Who, hand in hand together, sailed the seas, Not resting on the land, content as others By deputy to inhale the ocean breeze, But strong to sail alone the ocean spaces Ploughing the deep blue furrows flecked with foam, Not crying, like children lost in lonely places, âWe are lostâwhere are weâfind usâtake us home,â But crying rather, âhelmsman, we will forward Where most of all are dangers that devour, We are not landsmen to be frightened shoreward In terror at mere mention of a shower, Where waves are deep, and flies the fiercest spray There, helmsman, lies for us our lonely way;ââ âDark nights for these, and long lone hours of watching, Cold hands upon the tiller through the night, Like schoolboys counting hours, their knives notching Slow spaces of approach of morning light, And backward looking o'er the ocean-spaces To hearts of friends who stay at home on shore, And dreary midnight thoughts of lost embraces, And weary pulling at the weary oar, And doubts if after all the labour boots them And wiser after all are those at home, Doubts which arise though mouth of no man moots them, Mouths tightly set with stern resolve to roam Onward, aye ever onward to the end, Though arms wax feeble, and strong oar-blades bend; Bend wearily, as bend above the handles Bowed breasts of the once eager-hearted band, Faint light upon them thrown from lantern candles That here and there among the benches stand, Just making visible the outer ocean Flinging on all sides angry spots of spray, And shadows, as it were, of hands in motion To rend the boat in splinters as a prey, Great giant shadows, flung from out the blackness Hanging around them, heavy, like a pall, And walls of water right across their track, less Easy to climb than cliffs of granite tall, All these, and other horrors bar the way Of passengers from twilight unto day; But unto these few, in that they still trusted, And bore their heads up 'mid the seas of scorn, And kept their helmets bright, and swords not rusted, And shields untarnished, neither banners torn, To these is given to see the first faint flushing Of sunrise ushering in the future day, And bright cloud-clusters o'er the ether rushingâ Eyes strained to catch the first faint rosy ray, And lips apart, and nostrils all expanded, Strung to inhale the savour of the breeze From off the hay-fields, sweet to men new-landed From over barren breadths of scentless seas, Odours of home that bring the hot salt tears To hardy eyes that have not wept for years; For all the old loves in the sweet new morning Seem stronger still, and better than before, Besides that many a new love has been born in The dreary long time since we left the shore, Loves now are wingÃ¨d that before were wingless, And lips are rosy that were pale of old, Dost think that any bird of song would sing less If broken down were bars of cage that hold, That cheek of maiden would not bloom the fairer For keen embraces of the rough salt sea, That rosy flowers of flesh would be the rarer If torn from out hot flower-pots, fresh and free, Full free themselves to wander, and explore Dim visions only seen as yet from shore? The birds are free, and all the fields and flowers, And flying clouds, and spaces of the air, And foam-bells flung from off the seas in showers, And seaweed floating, like long waving hair, The insects all are free, the world of creatures That underlies our own on every side Have faces fair, with no distorted features, On wings of nature, fetterless, they ride, And hard it is to see why man, the noblest, Should tie himself by senseless iron chains, Man, who, of all the creatures ought to know best That Liberty is, truly, She who reigns, While all the other queens are fitful shades Their worship only a fond dream that fades; Around us, yesterday, the skies were raining, And we were all enswathed in driving mist, And eyes were sore, and heavy hearts were straining, To-day by happiness our souls are kissed; We stand upon the summit of the mountain, And see the fair green valleys far below, And many a silver stream, and many a fountain, And many a league of blossom white as snow, Bright spots are here and there, laburnum clusters, Whose slender fingers drip with yellow rain, And red and white horse-chestnuts, stalwart musters, And sheets of purple lilac strew the plain, For face of morning that upon us gleams Is wreathed with smiles of spring-time as it seems; The world then, after all, is not a medley, A chaos of twisted snakes that intertwine, A seething mass of human heads, a deadly Fermenting flask of every kind of wine Mixed at haphazard, but a fair great picture, Complete in every part from side to side, Open to keenest glance, severest stricture, Of men within itâmany-coloured, wide Enough to satisfy the largest craving, With many a nook and corner for the small, Its floor with inlaid land and water paving, And roof of ether, stainless, over all, On all sides round about, beneath, above, Clasping the whole in soft strong arms of love. RELIGIONISTS. Let us fix our eyes upon distant skies, And turn from a world that in wickedness lies, Let us flee, let us pray, let us hurry away, For the maw of the devil is big, say they; Let us crucify flesh, the devil's own mesh, And fly from his states and turn âSecesh,â 'Tis a very bad thing for sinners to sing, Slow psalms are the tunes that happiness bring; Aside let us shove soft savours of love, Laid up for us all are treasures above, Rose-lips of delight are not for a knight Enamoured of flowers of Paradise bright; Bodies of clay were built for a day, Here upon earth for a minute we stay, Yet it is true that only a few Shall pierce to the height of the Heaven of blue; All the rest in the fiery nest Of Gehenna are laid by the devil's behest, We upon high look down from the sky Upon neighbours and friends that in agony lie; Theirs is the blame, they never came To our Church, and visited now by shame, Each shall repent that his ears he lent To temptation, and over the broad way went; Upon earth in pride these sinners derideâ Poor puffed up people!âsaints who have sighed, Now let them see that happy are we, From the pit not one of them forth can flee; Babes are there, the devil to spare Is seldom wont, and all who dare To impugn his will the fire shall kill, And breath of them power of his shall spill; Let us all rejoice, let us lift our voice, We that have made the righteous choice, We are inside, and these that defied Our warnings given to the depths have hied; Not to return, for ever to burn, Each that Religion on earth shall spurn, In the depths of the pit, by hammering hit Of the fiends, and fires of agony lit. THE AGONY OF THE AGE. Horror of darkness, agony of craving And straining after what we cannot see, Bound hand and foot, fast, powerless to flee, One moment dumb with stupor, wildly raving The next, a maddening memory still saving Deep down within some ancient recollection Of life and love and laughter and affection, Green fields and flowers and leaves and branches waving; Pierces the walls of e'en this hideous prison A ray of light, a memory of the sea Dancing beneath a summer sun new-risen, Risen for all things else, not risen for me, A dream, a vain mirage, a vanishing vision, That leaves the dark a deeper dark to be; A consciousness of misery, and of gladness A pale faint shadow that seemeth Ã¦ons old, A dream that's talked about, a tale that's told, A dim delusion, echo of all men's madness, Their refuge from the pelting storms of sadness, A hut, a furze-bush on a lonely wold; Short time it shields them for the walls are rolled Asunder, and reality that had less Pity than foe that waits to gather force, Beats hard upon them, and they fold their arms, And take it as the merest matter of course, And close their eyes, and see the wondrous charms Of Beauty fade and fall without remorse, And all the might of men, and war's alarms, And warrior's ecstasy, and love that strengthens, And strainÃ¨d hour of battle life that lengthens, And sink beneath a weight of windless calms; At times they rouse them, rise, and feebly wonder, âWhat was itâwhere is itâcan it be trueâ The life we lived, the work we used to do, The open sea, the sky, the clouds, the thunder, The piled-up heaps by lightning torn asunder With intermittent glimpses of the blue, The force of freshness when we rose anew The purse of each new day's delights to plunder?â Raising their heads and looking each to other, Resting a weary brain on weary hand, Each says to each, âdo you believe it, brother, Is it a dream, or was there such a land, A land of love, of sister and of mother, Have we lain here for ever, did we stand Once fair among the foremost doing battle, Rejoicing in the roaring and the rattle, Or is it all a desolate waste of sand? âWhose fault is it, why is it we are sleeping With weary heads upon the yellow sand, A circle of sleepers, an inactive band, Stiff as the stony circle that is keeping Mute watch at Stonehenge, while the world is weeping, Laughing, enjoying, tasting tears and sorrow, And mirthfulness to-day and death to-morrow, And times of birth, of sowing and of reaping? Were it not well at least to have a part In action, to immerse oneself in living, Though action brought with it a keener smart Than Buddhist feels his conscious life upgiving To the Infinite Soul, to mingle in the mart, And drink one's fill of struggling and of striving? âBut who will set us free? the winds are free, The waters rise and fall for very gladness, The evening pang, the shadow of sunset sadness At morning advent fades in infinite glee, The leaves pass kisses on from tree to tree, The summer brings a sound of happy lovers, An everlasting tunefulness that hovers High on the hills, and shines upon the sea; The Universe is Happinessâbut we, Striving in vain to tear away the chains That circle us, the more acutely see Our own consuming atmosphere of pains, Long only the more maddeningly to flee, The more triumphantly the sunshine reigns Without us, the more ecstasy in the sky, The more would we weave wings for us and fly, But back we sink exhausted on the plains; âBlack plains of horror, destitute of greenness, Brooding above them lowers a lurid sky, We gasp, and, could we, willingly would die If but to escape the visions of uncleanness And tear aside the rags and robes of meanness, The rags that flutter around us as we lie; The silence, piled upon us mountains high, Burns in upon our brainlessness, sereneness Of Infinite Atmosphere towers above our faces, We sink into ourselves and fall for ever And find no footing in the void, endeavour A something sometimes seen in distant places, A creature of the fancy, or a star At times appearing dimly from afar, While Hope, the Rainbow-Goddess, leaveth never Of passage of her train the tiniest traces.â A NINETEENTH-CENTURY âEPITHALAMION.â IN THREE PARTS. âMy darling, do you care for me at all?â âI only love you, sweet,â the maiden said, He answered not, but slowly sank his head Upon the breast his being held in thrall; A time of sacred silence, and of rapture, And giant thoughts that round the planet roll And dance from star to star, and chase and capture Echoes of the Universal Soul, Of race-horse thoughts that pant from pole to pole, And skim the ages, and returning pour The wealth they've gathered on time's shelving shore At feet of her their master bends before; The cup of ecstasy can hold no more, It groans for very fulness, seething o'er It floods with flowers the encircling floor, Passion the chrysalis must find a door To free herself, and now the kisses rain, Till pleasure sinks into the lap of pain, Thence to arise, strong to receive, again; Rejoice ye stars and heights of windy ether, And pass the message on from hand to hand, The Queen of air has stooped to wed beneath her, Love leads the Goddess of the sea to land, With hair of hers she weaves a silken band To link the seas of sunrise and of sunset, By no one has such sovereignty been won yet Of sister nymphs that haunt the ocean strand! Take up the message, wind, and waft it over The waste of waters, hearken waves of blue, Babble about the secret of a lover, And bear a name to coasts and countries new, The name of her to whom a reckless rover Resigns himself, henceforth strong, steadfast, true! Resigns himself, resigning each to other With loss of self the essence of the soul, Commingling into one white wondrous whole Embracing love of father, love of mother, With all the ancient love of sister, brother, The carpet of the future they unroll, Before them love lies outlined in a scroll, And live delights the laughing days to smother; They see before them traced in wondrous fashion A shadowy record of what is to be, Vales of endeavour, sunlight, heights of passion, Ecstatic glimpses, raging of the sea, While all the further end beyond unrolled, Melts mistlike into one wild wave of gold; And hand in hand together they will wander Through all the shady roadways of the land, Till hand in hand together they shall stand Upon the snowy summits that are yonder, Now pressing onward, pausing now to ponder, At times she stoops to pluck for him a flower, The fairest she can find, a gift, a dower, A dower that each of other leaveth fonder; As mind, and love, and life of each expands, While individual passion groweth stronger, It widens, reaching out to other lands, And, not the less intense, becometh longer, With eyes of light that look beyond âthe yonder,â High as the hills, a wealth too great to squander, Binding the earth together in broad bands. Words fail me; would that I could paint the wonder Of young souls met together on the earth, The growth of Giant passion, and the birth Of Love, that I could clothe my pen with thunder, That I could tear the sunset robes asunder, And paint with every colour of the sky The splendour of young love before I die And face the dark, and pass Death's gateway under; I faint, I fade, I cannot reach the meaning Of earth or air, of sea, or sky, or land, Bewildered in the centre, drowsily dreaming, While all the air with countless colours streaming Intoxicates with ecstasy, I stand, Afraid to move, afraid to raise a hand, Lest I disturb the Incense cloud around me slowly steaming! The joy that trembles at itself, the rapture, The keen pursuit, the glimpses of the goal, The more than mad delirium of the soul Realizing possibility of capture, The dreams at night as gorgeous as stories Of old Arabia, visions, sunset glories, The thought that after all it may be true, That woman's love may yet be left for you, âAnd dim delights of dark and morning raptureâ The Past and Present on for ever flowing Towards a Future time more glorious still, With speed of light the lightsome minutes going, With speed of sound the hours that work their will, A Righteous Willing, one with inclination, And Universe of Life, and world's rotation, And every sunlight shaft, and wandering rill! The notion runs throughout of the whole Universe of Things partaking, with an almost conscious sympathy, in the happiness of the happy lovers. PANTHEISTIC EFFUSIONS. WHAT THE DEAD MAN SAW. I am lying dead, deep down beneath the ground, Choked out from hope of loving, or of living, Hope of achieving aught, receiving, giving, Cold, motionless, alone, in graveclothes bound, All voiceless in a realm without a sound, A flash of memory at times reminding My soul with bitterness, black, biting, blinding, Of joys that once alive on earth I found; I sometimes seem to see the sky as clearly As ever, a happy child, I used to do, The birds and flies and flowers I loved so dearly, The broad green seas of grass, the arch of blue, The dream, departing, grazes me so nearly 'Tis hard to believe it baseless, bald, untrue; I find that I can still rejoice a little, Can still delight me in the life of others, Warm souls upon the earth, my moving brothers, In love the bubble, beautiful but brittle, Can still take pleasure in the thought that ever Life streameth onward, hurrying, loitering never, Its surface bearing fair white lily kisses, And sound of sighs and songs, and woes and blisses, Fierce flame of battle, failure, strong endeavour, Meetings that madden, partings souls that sever, Glimpses of heaven, weeping, wild embraces, Horrors of hell beneath, pale praying faces, And gleams of light from distant dazzling places, Glories that beckon onward, rainbow traces, Free heights of ether, snowy mountainous spaces, And Hope with wings, and eyes that smile for ever; The stream flows on though I have ceased to be, Flows over, under, through the conscious me, Expanded, widened out upon the tide, Free from encumbrance, fetterless, I ride, And float towards the universal sea, I feel the life of leaves, the grasses growing, One with the sower, in the seed he's sowing, Fulfilled with joy of harvest and of mowing, Partaker of the May-fly's dance of glee, I sip the honey with the humble bee, An antelope, I leap along the sands, And, like a lion, pace the lonely strands, In death I've found at last to life the key, One mighty blood pulse beats throughout the whole, One Central Heart, one Universal Soul, One Vital Force of all the lives that be; Along the polished graven groove of space In harmony the planets run their race, And tides of suns and starry clusters roll, The power that runs the race we call Free Force, Limitless fields of ether form the course, Each sun and moon a bounding burning horse Moving melodiously beneath control, A music sounds across from pole to pole, Beating a burthen out of sultry sands, Ringing the changes on the frozen lands, Dissolving, forming, joining hands in hands, Bringing the severed sons of men together, The extreme southern shores of rainless weather, The regions where the glittering iceberg stands, In one soft silken Universal Tether To link the scattered skeins of separate nations, Their planet homes, their lands, their several stations, Convolving into one triumphant whole, As seethes the rich red wine within the bowl, And foaming, flashing, slowly settles down; The end is worthy, such an end shall crown The writhing long-drawn serpent of the ages, The many-volumed roll of history's pages, Smoothing right out at last creation's frown! II. I wonder whether I shall ever arise, And join the ranks of men that work and fight, And reach again the region of delight? Far off from me the land of labour lies, Hope faints, and, fading into daylight, dies, Once rosy as the sunset, and as bright As the May moon that sails the seas of night, At morn before the great sun frigate flies; Though I am dead life flows around, above me, I find some comfort in its ceaseless flow, I hear the voices of the men that love me, They reach me lying, silent, far below, The grasses wave above my funeral mound, And love bears blossoms even underground. A COOL WET RIPPLE. I lose myself in all the life around me, A cool wet ripple adown the stream I go, I widen out to meet the hills that bound me, The horizon hills that bound my being's flow, Softly I melt me out into the ether All bathed about, without, within, with air, And sink into the earth, and dive beneath her Green surface-garden, blossoming, broad and fair, Along the branches brown I stretch my fingers, My finger tips pervade the points of leaves, Awake, aware of the warm life that lingers In the midst, the leafy soul that sings and grieves, Stirring the sap within the various veins With vegetable rapture, pangs and pains. THE HOME OF LOVE. Where is the home of Love? Upon the mountains Amid the icy peaks and slopes of snow, Or in the soft green valleys far below, Where willows' tresses trail in crystal fountains? Haunts he the homes that stud the sandy reaches, The white-washed walls where fisher-folk abide, Shaken at every rising of the tide, The dim expanse of shore, the gravelly beaches? Men seem uncertain; one there is that teaches That âLove is of the valley,â I think rather To every place and person he is father, Though diverse are his forms, and ways, and speeches; He dwells, methinks, in every bower of roses, And peeps from out each petal of a flower, Into the essence of the scent his power Impressed pervades the waves and widths of air, From point to point his balmy breath to bear, Laden with sweets of all the world of posies; Along the winding paths of woods he walks, And with the strawberry gatherers he talks, And hides himself within the yellow stalks Of corn, in seas of grass his head reposes, In petals of pimpernel his eyes he closes, Atween the curtains red secure he dozes, And all his panting pale pursuers balks; I've seen him seated all the livelong day Astride upon a scented seat of May Thrilling right out from thence his roundelay, And heard him in the night upon the seas Laugh in the blithesome laughter of the breeze, And shout a-sailing on the watery way, When he will shine upon us none can say, Nor where, 'tis âas his majesty doth please;â Sometimes, upon some merry summer morn From out a night of silvery silence born, The hills are startled with his hunting horn And all the crimson spaces of the dawn With sounds of life and light are sudden filled, While all the strings of melody are thrilled That right across creation's gulf are drawn, Like gossamer spiders' threads across a plain, Or air-dividing tiny threads of rain, Or streaks the canvas of the sky that stain When sunset's scarlet flames have riven and torn Its smooth white surface; sometimes in the night When all the waves are dancing, laughing light Melodious music underneath the moon, Ripple after ripple melting into tune, Love sends upon the soul a sudden swoon, And, losing self, across the seas one goes, While all the life of love about one flows, Along the veins in giant throbs and throes The hot blood pulsing, at one gasp of sight This Universe of mute mysterious might Flaming across one's vision, all the ages Read by the light of lightning, history's pages An open scroll, all wisdom of all sages, The sources whence pale Passion's river rages, The roots of that Great Tree whose leaf assuages Our mortal agonies, and for ever wages With evil one continual winning war; In slow procession through our eyelid portals The story of the loves and hates of mortals Streams endlessly, and all the loves that are And shall be, piercing through the silent spaces Our eyes behold at once the world's embraces, The hands that pray, the passion of all faces, The circle of caresses, tear-drop traces, Hope's chariot around the world that chases The steeds of dark Despair, the wars of races, We hear the sound of kisses in all places; And, hand in hand with Love, from star to star We dance along the railroad rays of light, Cleaving, as if with arrow's fiery flight, The abysmal sacred silences of Night, Finding in every moon the self-same story, With golden sheaf of similar human glory The glorious heads of solar systems crowned, We span the spaces star from star that sunder, And all the cloudy home of Monarch Thunder And bright-eyed Lady Lightning his fair spouse, [The Queen of those that kissâher kisses slay,] Lies bare before us, in the air around Mighty orchestral choruses resound, From off the surfaces of spheres that bound Alive along the windy ways of space Flung loudly and triumphantly; they rouse The sleeping white-enfolded form of Day, Who casts aside with rosy fluttering fingers The star-bespangled robe of Night that lingers Still here and there about the western sky, And, opening wide his single sunny eye, Across the fields of ether far and nigh Sends glances hot the dews of dark to dry, And gladden into scent the flowers that sigh For his sweet coming, into song the birds, And into motion musical the herds, Smiling upon them with his festive face. THE POET'S BRIDE. Pleasant it is beneath a tree to lie And, gazing upward, see the turquoise sky Broken across by moving emeralds green, Emeralds all blazing with the golden sheen The sunlight casts upon them, every leaf Of colour, green and gold, a shining sheaf, Shining against the broad background of blue That burns above and, parted, glistens through, As though ten thousand maidens' bright blue eyes Were peeping through the leaves in soft surprise, Or eyes of fairies in a virtuous glow Of anger at the mortal stretched below, Inquisitive to search the mysteries Deep hidden within the leafy hearts of trees; Pleasant again to stretch one's being wide, Unclothed, unfettered, out from side to side, And, lengthening long arms, oneself at rest In some soft, grassy, flower-scented nest, To embrace the whole wide earth in clasp of love, And feel her green arms slowly close above Your sinking head, feeling as if you were Slow-sinking in some scented sea of air, Or rosy summer-quiet sunset-sea, Clothed all about with mists of ecstasy; Yea, the Earth is indeed the poet's bride, A Queen for ever seated at his side. Upon the fair broad billow of her breast His head falls heavily and sinks to rest, And she bends over him, his hot brow bathing In her cool ether breath, his limbs enswathing In wreaths of long-leaved blossoming grass and flowers, Cooling her hero with the sound of showers Down-shaken in the distance, breathing rest In every rising of her gentle breast And happiness in the downfall, now she twines About his brow a bower of eglantines, Or places underneath his sleeping head Soft cushions woven of roses white and red, Smoothing with gentle hands his grassy bed, Now all her art for him the Earth combines That scents of all her choicest garden flowers By savour sweet may soothe his sleeping hours, Building about him misty perfume bowers From off the universe of blossoms shed; O great Earth-Goddess, happy indeed is he That man to whom thy beauties wedded be, Though all men scorn him, Thou, the Earth, art wide, And his alone art Thou from side to side, For him buds, blossoms, flowers and fruits are born, Wave goldenly for him long leagues of corn, Forests and rivers, lakes and silent seas, All shower drops, every whisper of a breeze, The whole world's wealth of beauty, forms and flowers, Sweet sounds and scents and sights and woven bowers Of all fair colours interlaced together, With all white wild delights of winter weather, And bare-browed summer revelry, and spring's Soft ecstasy when all the greenwood rings With loud love songs of every bird that sings And happy voices of ten thousand things Bursting aside their ice-bound wintry tether; All these are his, the Earth-Queen's bridal dower, Her secrets all are in the poet's power, Placed by her gently in his humble hands, Sweet secrets that he only understands Of all men, silent secrets of the sea, Sad secrets some of things that hidden be, And secrets soft hidden in the hearts of roses, Others the deep green forest soul discloses, Others again that smile from out the sky When sunsets of November seem to dye The clouds in scarlet, fading with a sigh Of low wind bitter-breathed across the wold, Like some bright meteor-life whose tale is told, Into cold calm-eyed distances of grey, Hot blue-robed summer secrets of the day, And secrets of the night his Queen unfolds To the poet, over him her white hand holds The great unspeakable silence of the Dark, Sacred, as some sweet maiden you may mark From sunlight strong to shield her lover's head Low lying beside her; from his happy bed At dawn the Queen awakes him, from her breast Raising him, right content therein to rest For ever, and across the world she takes His soul in great grand glimpses, lonely lakes He sees beset by snowy mountains tall, A blue sky burning constant over all, And wide dim reaches of hot yellow sand, And flowery visions of a verdant land, Well watered, smiling, rich from side to side, Intense in colour, next the dreamers ride Along the edges of a creeping tide, Out and away blue distances of sea Into the infinite ether seem to flee That sits upon the horizon like a throne And claims the land and seascape for its own Brooding above the whole, along the edge Towers a wave-clomb, black-browed, beetlingledge Of cliff, kissed here and there by lights of green And white, deep-carven clefts pierce in between As where some giant's chisel erst has been Shining with soothing sound and silver sheen Of rivulets drawn from out the rocky wedge; At last he sinks into her arms and sleeps, And she bends over him, and smiles and weeps, Soft tears and smiles of Beauty born together Like rain and sunshine in uncertain weather Making a beaming rainbow of her face, White arms she winds about him that embrace His form as lovingly as arms of roses Whose wealth of tenderness some wall encloses With wreaths of flowers and leaves and rich perfume, Or dark green ivy clusters that entomb The trunk of some great weary prostrate tree, She holds her servant safe from harm, and he, Half conscious of the embraces of his bride, Floats dimly down the sleepy fast-flowing tide That runs to meet the quiet dreamful wide Illimitable haven of the sea. CHANGES. It does not take very long To change the colour of things, A cloud that a storm-blast brings Has blue behind, loud sings The bird who before was strong To scatter the wet from his wings; A thunderous afternoon Is oftentimes light as it grows Towards eventide, Alpine snows Gleam rosy on heights and blows Blue gentian, under the moon The mad sea softly flows; Gleams from behind the clouds At even, suddenly red, The sun's great glorious head, And light of his presence is shed, Fast breaking the dun grey shrouds, Across the waves that were dead; Suddenly green and blue Flecked with breakers of white Gleams the ocean, a sight To madden a man with delight As the wail of the wind whistles through His brain, and wakes in him might; Falls upon sunburnt sails A smile of the sun, and they shine, Shine ruddy, the whole long line Of fishing boats, mists of the Rhine Gathered high when the sunlight fails Scatter, ruins and rocks are fine; Broad blue breadths of the sea Change to a sullen grey, For the light is taken away, The clear white light of the day, And the distances darken and flee Far further, and thickens the spray; But rises the sun in the morn, And the shoals and the porpoises play, And the grey mists quicken away, And the rose-streaks redden and stray In the east, and Beauty is born, And rises a glad new day. NORTH AND SOUTH. Praise we the skies of the North, And the grey long seas and the foam, And the slope of the beach by our home, And the mariners hard to roam, Most lusty to issue forth! Laud we the sands of the South, The green sweet shores and the blue, With a soft light shimmering through Still waves that float a canoe, That wash by the harbour mouth! Praise we the arms of our men, Most sinewy, muscular, lean, Lithe bodies shapely and clean, Long limbs that have wrestled and seen A fierce hot race now and then! Laud we our women and eyes Very lovely, that after the day Has burned its beauty away Expand, plead, sparkle, and pray, When the mists of the evening rise! Praise we our fair-cheeked girls, Red lips, and roses, and hair For the most part golden, and rare Blue glances cast here and there Upon young unnoticing churls! Laud we the pale clear brow Of a passionate queen of the land Where the olives and oranges stand, And the myrtles, and hand in hand The milk-white oxen plough! Praise we a Northern flower, Upright, strong, lady of light, With modesty clothed for a might, And eyes as the stars that are bright When the long cold nights are in power! Laud we a Southern maid, With the fire and the sweet firm walk, And the movements supple, and talk Of a meeting soon where the cork Trees furnish a suitable shade! POWERLESS! Sad to see but not To be able alas! to do, To see the thing that is new, And know that this is what They want, that this is true; But not to be able to speak, Though a man may struggle and sigh, Though fire flash from the eye, And fire burn on the cheek, To be passed, inaudible, by; To struggle as one in a dream To burst the choking bands Of unreality's lands, To be and not to seem, To loose the powerless hands, But back again to be thrown Into the old dark place, We who had known the grace Of Beauty, we thought, to moan For a sight of her bright sweet face, For a sight of her we adore Piercing the gloom of the dark, That we with wings of a lark May rise the universe o'er Grown small as a dim small spark, And shower down from the skies Manifold gifts for men, Light, and fire now and then, Songs, and melodious cries, Rocket-like flash of a penâ Bitter it is, when our work Is some such as this, to be bound On earth, and here to be found Feeble, seeming to shirk Our duty, giving no sound.
