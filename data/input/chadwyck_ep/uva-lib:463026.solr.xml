      <field name="fulltext">LEGENDYS OF HOOLY WUMMEN Prologus Two thyngys owyth euery clerk To aduertysyn, begynnyng a werk, If he procedyn wyl ordeneelly: The fyrste is ‘what’, the secunde is ‘why’. In wych two wurdys, as it semyth me, The foure causys comprehendyd be, Wych, as philosofyrs vs do teche, In the begynnyng men owe to seche Of euery book; and aftyr there entent The fyrst is clepyd cause efficyent, The secunde they clepe cause materyal, Formal the thrydde, the fourte fynal. The efficyent cause is the auctour, Wych aftyr hys cunnyng doth hys labour To a-complyse the begunne matere, Wych cause is secunde; and the more clere That it may be, the formal cause Settyth in dew ordre clause be clause. And these thre thyngys longyn to ‘what’: Auctour, matere, and forme ordinat. The fynal cause declaryth pleynly Of the werk begunne the cause why; That is to seyne, what was the entent Of the auctour fynally, &amp; what he ment. Lo! thus ye seen mown compendyously How in these two wurdys ‘what’ &amp; ‘why’, Of eche werk the foure causys aspye Men mown, requyryd be philosophye. But to oure purpoos: if be ‘what’ or ‘why’ Be questyounn maad of thys tretyhs pleynly As for the fyrste, who so lyst to here, Certeyn the auctour was an austyn frere, Whos name as now I ne wyl expresse, Ne hap that the vnwurthynesse Bothe of hys persone &amp; eek hys name Myht make the werk to be put in blame, And so, for hate of hym and eek despyht, Perauenture fewe shuld haue delyht It to redyn, and for this chesoun Throwyn it in the angle of oblyuyoun. And yet me thinkyth it were pete That my werk were hatyd for me; For this, I suppose, alle men weel knowe: No man the rose awey doth throwe Althow it growe vp-on a thorn; Who is so nyce that wil good corn Awey caste for it growyth in chaf? Men also drynkyn ale and lef the draf, Albe-it that ale thorgh draf dede ren. Gold eek, as knowe weel alle wyse men, In foul blak erthe hath hys growyng, And yet is gold as a precyous thyng Streyhtly be-schet in many a cophyr. A margerye perle, aftyr the phylosophyr, Growyth on a shelle of lytyl pryhs, Yet is it precyous; and no man whyhs The verteuous crepaude despyse lest, Thow a todys crowne were hys fyrst nest. And to thys manyfold of nature Exaunplys acordyth weel scrypture; For, as the old testament beryth wytnesse, The sone hys fadrys wykkydnesse Shal not bere, but if he it sewe; And if he do, thanne is it dewe That he be partenere in peyne As he was in blame, thys is certeyne. Wherefore, if my werk be sure, Lete not disdeyn it disfigure Of the auctour, I lowly beseche; For sekyr that were a symple wreche, As a lytyl to-forn now here seyd is, Te slee the chyld for the fadrys mys. The matere wych I wil of wryte, Althow but rudely I kun endyte, Is the lyf of blyssyd Margarete, Virgyne &amp; martyr, whom dede hete The loue of Ihesu in hyr tendyr age So feruently, that for al the rage Of fers Olibrius, and hys tyrannye, Than cryst forsaken she had leuere dye, As pleynly declaryth hyr legende, As they shul heryn wych lyst attende. The forme of procedyng artificyal Is in no wyse ner poetycal After the scole of the crafty clerk Galfryd of ynglond, in his newe werk, Entytlyd thus, as I can aspye, Galfridus anglicus, in hys newe poetrye, Enbelshyd wyth colours of rethoryk So plenteuously, that fully it lyk In May was neuere no medewe sene Motleyd wyth flours on hys verdure grene; For neythyr Tullius, prynce of oure eloquence. Ner Demostenes of Grece, more affluence Neuere had in rethoryk, as it semyth me, Than had this Galfryd in hys degre. But for-as-meche as I neuere dede muse In thylk crafty werk, I it now refuse, And wil declaryn euene by and by Of seynt Margrete, aftyr the story, The byrthe, the fostryng, and how she cam Fyrst to the feyth and sythe to martyrdam, As ny as my wyt it kan deuyse Aftyr the legende; &amp; sythe what wyse Be whom. &amp; how oftyn she translated was And where now she restyth, &amp; in what plas, As I dede lerne wyth-owte fayle The laste tyme I was in Itayle, Bothe be scripture and eek be mowthe; Wych story is no-thyng vnkowthe At mownt Flask—who me not leue, Lete hym go thedyr &amp; he shal it preue— On thys half Rome ful fyfty myle Or ellys more, where men begyle The wery pylgrymys kun ful wel Wyth Trybyan in stede of Muskadel; Where from Rome homward ageyn Whil I was taryed wyth greth reyn Thys blyssyd virgyne I dede visyte, And al the processe I dede owt wryte Wych I purpose now to declare On ynglysh, &amp; it brout wyth me to Clare. But who-so wyl aske me fynally Of thys translacyoun the cause why In to oure language, I sey causys two Most pryncypally me meuyd ther-to. The fyrst cause is for to excyte Mennys affeccyoun to haue delyte Thys blyssyd virgyne to loue &amp; serue, From alle myscheuys hem to preserue, Aftyr the entent of hyr preyere Beforn hyr deth, as ye aftyr shul here. And no man wundyr thow I diligence Do to plesyn the wurthy excellence Of thys holy maydyn, for euene by Wher I was born, in an old pryory Of blake chanons hyr oo foot is, Bothe flesh and boon, I dare seyn this, Where thorgh a cristal bryht and pure Men may behoden eche feture Ther-of, saf the greth too only And the hele, wych in a nunry Been, Redyng clepyd, as they there seyn. But as for the foot, this is certeyn, Many a myracle hath ther be shewyd Bothe on lernyd &amp; eek on lewyd. And specyally if wyth broche or ryng The foot men towche at here partyng Vp-on the bare, and wyth hem it bere, If they ben in ony dreed or fere To myscheuyn, lete hem be-hete Thedyr to bere and there to lete The same thyng that towchyd the fote, And they shul sone han helthe &amp; bote, If they it doo wyth good deuocyounn. Thys is fully myn opynyounn. For treuly, vp-on my conscyence, I had herof good experyence Not mykyl past, yerys fyue, Whan lytyl from venyse me dede dryue A cruel tyraunth in-to a fen Owt of a barge, and fyue mo men; Wher I supposyd to haue myscheuyd, Had not me the grace releuyd Of god, be the blyssyd medyacyoun Of thys virgyne, aftyr myn estimacyoun. For sone aftyr I had be-hyht the ryng, Wyth wych I towchyd at my partyng Hyr foot bare, to bryngyn ageyn, I was releuyd ryht sone certeyn. Now blissyd mote be that holy virgyne Wych to synful preyers lyst hyr ere enclyne! And thys is oo skyl why I am steryd the more Hyr lyf to translate, as I seyde to-fore. Anothyr cause wych that meuyd me To make thys legende, as ye shal se, Was the inportune and besy preyere Of oon whom I loue wyth herte entere, Wych that hath a synguler deuocyoun To thys virgyne of pure affeccyoun. He me requyryd wyth humble entent Whos request to me is a comaundement That yif I hym louyd I wold it doo. I durst not hastyly assente hym to (Weel knowyng myn owyn infyrmyte) Tyl I had a whyle weel auysyd me. And thanne the yeer of grace a thowsend treuly Foure hundryd and also thre and fourty, In the vigylye of the Natyuyte Of hyr that is gemme of virgynyte, The seuenete day euene of Septembre, Whan I gan inwardly to remembre Hys request growndyd in pete, Me thowt it were ageyn cheryte Hys desyr lengere for to denye. And yet I sore feryd me of enuye, Wych is euere besy and eek diligent To depraue priuyly others trewe entent; Wherfore, hyr malyhs to represse, My name I wil not here expresse, As toforn is seyd; wherfore I preye And requere eek, if I it dare seye, Yow, sone and fadyr, to whom I dyrecte This symple tretyhs, that ye detecte It in no wyse wher that vylany It myht haue, and pryncypally At hoom at Caunbrygge in your hows, Where wyttys be manye ryht capcyows And subtyl, wych sone my lewydnesse Shuld aspye; wherfore, of ientylnesse, Kepyth it as cloos as ye best kan A lytyl whyle; and not-for-than If ye algate shul it owth lete go, Be not aknowe whom it comyth fro, But seyth, as ye doon vndyrstand, It was you sent owt of Ageland From a frend of yourys that vsyth to selle Goode hors at feyrys, &amp; doth dwelle A lytyl fro the Castel of Bolyngbrok, In a good town wher ye fyrst tok The name of Thomas, &amp; clepyd is Borgh In al that cuntre euene thorgh &amp; thorgh; And thus ye shul me weel excuse, And make that men shul not muse To haue of me ony suspycyoun. But, for to drawe to a conclusyoun Of thys long tale now fynally, I you beseche, frend, ryht enterly, That ye vouchesaf for me to preye On-to thys virgyne, that ere I deye Thorgh hyr merytys I may purchase Of my mysleuyng a pardounn of grace, And of myn old &amp; newe transgressyoun That I may haue a plener remyssyoun, And aftyr the ende of thys owtlawrye Wyth hyre a-boue for to magnyfye God in hys blysful eternyte, Where neuere shal ende felycyte. In wych place vs bothe to dwelle, The lord vs graunte that harwyd helle. Amen. Vita Scæ Margaretae Virginis et Martiris Prologus Of seynt Margarete, the virgyne pure, Wych lyknyd is to a precyous margaryte, And that wurthyly, as in old scrypture It is wrytyn, I me now delyte The lyf to translate, if me wil respyte Attropos a whyle and not to hastyly My fatal threed a-sundyr smyte Wych lachesys hath twynyd ful yerys fyfty. And conuenyently this uirgyne gloryous May to a margaryte comparyd be, Wych is whyht, lytyl, and eek verteuous, As seyn auctours, of thylk propyrte. Whyht was Margrete be virgynyte, Be meknesse lytyl, and most singulerly Verteuous be hyr excellent cheryte, In myraclys werkyng shewyd plenteuously. Louyd she nowt well virgynyte And of body and soule to kepe clennesse, Whan Olibrius hyr profryd his wyf to be, And that she shuld be clepyd a pryncesse, And greth tresore shuld haue &amp; rychesse, Lust, welthe and wurshepe excellently, And for clennesse sake, as I do gesse, Alle hys greth profyrs she set nowt by? Greth meknesse she had for cristys sake Whan the tytyl of hyr natal dygnyte In hyr yung age she dede for-sake, And hys handmaydyn she chees to be, Not settyng be hyr fadrys enmyte, And wyth hyr noryhs dwellyd wylfully In poure astate and in low degre, Kepyng hyr sheep ful dilygently. And if we wyl speken of cheryte I-wys she had ryht greth habundaunnce, As in hyr passyoun weel shewyd she; For, as hyr legende makyth remembraunnce, She steryd the pepyl euere to repentaunce, And to wynne hem to god was ful besy; And whan she shuld deye, wyth gret constaunce She maad a preyere most cherytabylly. More-ouyr, as I doo wretyn fynde, In a book clepyd the goldene legende, And it is takyn of the auctours of kynde, The Margaryte, if of blood descende Greth flux, is good it to amende; And the cardyacle passyoun meruelously From hurt of the herte it wyl defende; And mannys spyrtys it counnfortyth souereynly. And for this threfold manere of propyrte Of the margaryte, may seynt Margrete On-to that gemme weel comparyd be; For alle thre propyrtees to hyr were mete, And as for the fyrst, I you behete, Whan hyr blood owt ran ful copyously, She was so enflawmyd wyth heuenely hete That she it al suffryd ful stedefastly. As for the cardyacle that tentacyoun Betoknyth, as clerkys doon declare, Of oure gostly enmye wych is euere boun Mankende to trappe, and wil not spare Hem to brynge in to sorwe and care. Yet hurt he hyr neuere, thow he were sly, Ne no wyse hyr kecche myht in his snare, But euere of hym she had the victory. In that the margaryte is a confortatyf Of mannys spirytys, it was weel sene In oure Margarete, wych al hyr lyf Was in hyr spirytys bothe pure &amp; clene, Thorgh whos clennesse many oon be-dene Were in here spirytys counfortyd inwardly, And thorgh hyr doctryne, as I do wene, Steryd to leue synne and eek foly. Thus for this sexefold propyrte Of the margaryte wych deuly longe To seynt Margarete be congruyte Of simylytude, we may vndyrfonge That in sexe vertuhs she was stronge, As in chastyte, mekenesse, &amp; suyngly In cheryte, in constaunce of suffryng wronge, In goostly counfort and in vyctory. These sexe vertuhs be fyguryd mystyly In the sexe wengys wych that Isaye Of the cherubyns in hys vysyoun sy Vp-on the hy throne, wyth hys gostly yhe, Stondyng, and to oure purpos now signyfye That this blyssyd mayde Margrete wurthyly Be these sexe vertuhs to heuene dede stye, Ther in ioye to dwellyn perpetuelly. Now, blyssyd virgyne, wich in heuene aboue Art crownyd in blysse ful gloryously, To them in erthe that the serue and loue Be euere propycyous, and specyally Vouchesaf of thy singuler grace, lady, My wyt and my penne so to enlumyne Wyth kunnyng &amp; eloquence that suffycyently Thy legende begunne I may termyne. [4 blank lines.] Whylom, as the story techyth vs, In Antyoche, that gret cyte, A man ther was, clepyd Theodosius, Wych in gret state stood and dignyte; For of paynymrye the patryark was he, And had the reule and al the gouernaunce, To whom alle prestys dede obecyaunce. This Theodosius had a wyf ful mete To hys astate, of whom was born A doughtyr fayr, and clepyd Margarete, As prouyded was of god beforn. But ryht as of a ful sharp thorn Growyth a rose bothe fayr &amp; good, So sprong Margrete of the hethene blood. For thow hyr fadyr &amp; modyr in ydolatry Were born &amp; fostryd, and eek dede fyne Here lyf in the same, and myserabylly Aftyr here deth went to helle pyne, Yet hyr dede grace so illumyne That she bothe crystnyd &amp; martyrd was, And went to heuene, that gloryous plas. Hyr fadyr ful glad was of hyr byrthe, Hopyng she shuld haf be his counfort In his olde dayes, and maad gret myrthe, To whom meche peple dede resort, Bothe men and wummen, &amp; maad disport, Thankyng here goddys wyth herte glad That here patryark so fayr yssu had. I kan in no wyse remembre me That euere I red in the hethene gyse What rytys were vsyd &amp; what royalte In namys yeuyng, but, as I deuyse, It was doon in ful solemne wyse An wyth many a cerimonye, &amp; specyally In the chyldryns berthe of statys hy. Aftyr this, as it was the guyse In thoo dayes and yet it is so Among astatys, in ful goodly wyse A noryhs here doughtyr they prouydyd to, Not fer fro hoom, the wych shuld do Al hyr dilygence and eek besynesse The chyld to fostryn in al tendyrnesse. This noryhs dwellyd from the cyte Of Antyoche fourelongys but fyftene, And priuyly a cristene wumman was she And in al hyr conuersacyounn bothe pure &amp; clene, As in that folwyth it was weel sene; For Margarete she fostryd in al vertu, And tawth hyr the feyth of crist Ihesu. But whan hyr moder was from hens past, Wych deyid whil she was tendyr of age, Margarete hyr affeccyoun set so fast Vp-on hyr noryhs bothe wyhs &amp; sage, That she forsook al hyr hey lynage, And purposyd hyr fully ther to soiourne, For to hyr fadyr she nold hom returne. And for she dede wurshepe crist &amp; loue, And wold not ageyn turne to paynymry, Hyr fadyr hyr hatyd &amp; dede reproue, And yaf no force what vylany She had had; but the souereyn lord on hy Thergeyn hyr fyllyd wyth so gret vertu That in fewe yerys she perfyht greu. And not only this excellence she had in grace, But eek, to spekyn of hyr nature, Of al that cuntre in the rownd compace Was nowher so fayr a creature; For shap &amp; colour and eche feture Were conproporcyond in swych equalyte That she myht be merour of al bewte. Wherfore, if the crafth of descrypcyounn I cowde as weel both forge and fyle As cowd Boyce in hys phisycal consolacyounn, Or as Homer, Ouyde, or ellys Virgyle, Or Galfryd of ynglond, I wolde compyle A clere descripcyounn ful expressely Of alle hyr feturys euene by &amp; by. But sekyr I lakke bothe eloquens And kunnyng swych maters to dilate, For I dwellyd neuere wyth the fresh rethoryens, Gower, Chauncers, ner wyth lytgate, Wych lyuyth yet, lest he deyed late, Wherfore I preye eche man hertly Haue me excusyd thow I do rudly. And not oonly this virgyne had singlerly Of the yiftys of kynde gret plente, But also wyth vertuhs ful excellently In hyr soule inward endewyd was she For she had feyth, hope and cheryte, The deuyne vertuhs, and ther-wyth-al The foure gret vertuhs clepyd cardynal. And whan she to fyftene yer of age Was come, and herde how cruelly Cristene blood thorgh the fers rage Of tyrauntys was sheed euene by &amp; by, For crist to deye she hyr maad redy, And in the mene whyle she dede keep In the feld eche day hyr noryhs sheep. This same tyme on-to Antyoche A tyraunnt, the prefect of that cuntre, From Asiaward proudly dede aproche, And Olibrius be name clepyd was he. But as he went, wher he myht see Ony cristene men, ful cruelly He hem destroyed wythowte mercy. And casuelly as be the same weye He rood wher Margarete dede pasture Hyr noryhs sheep, sodeynly his eye On hyr he kest, of contenaunce demure, And anoon hyr bewte so sore dede lure Hys herte, that euene stylle he stent, And of hyr he took more auysement. And whan he sey hyr forheed lely-whyht, Hyr bent browys blake, &amp; hyr grey eyne, Hyr chyry chekys, hyr nose streyt &amp; ryht, Hyr lyppys rody, hyr chyn, wych as pleyne Pulshyd marbyl shoon, &amp; clouyn in tweyne, He was so astoynyd of that sodeyn caas That vnnethe he wyste wher that he was. He lokyd no ferthere than in hyr face, Where of natural yiftys plente was I-now; Hym thowte that neuere in so lytyl space He had more seyn wych his herte drow As the magnet doth iryn; but whan of his swow As a man a-masyd he sodeynly dede abreyde Thus wyth sad contenaunce to his men he seyde. ‘Goth forth fast yund, wher ye see A ful fayr mayden hyr sheep kepyng, And wetyth veryly whethyr bonde or fre She is, and bryngyth me sekyr tydyng. If she be fre, I wyl wyth a ryng Hyr wedde, and brynge to gret honoure, And endewe hyr in many a castel &amp; tour. If she be bonde and vndyr seruage, For I wyl noon othyr man do wronge, Hyr lord wyl I yeue ryht good wage, And to my paramour hyr vndyrfonge. Hastyth you forth and taryith not longe, For from this place I nyl parte certeyn Til ye an answere me brynge ageyn.’ Whan this was seyd, ful hastyly Hys men hem hyed til where she was They come, to whom ful manerly Of here comyng they told the caas; And anoon al the blood owt of hyr faas For sodeyn feer was styrt awey, And deuo[u]tly to god she thus dede prey: ‘Haue mercy, lord ihesu, vp-on me, And lese not my soule wyth vnpetous men! Make me, lord, euere to ioyin in the, And wyth thy seruauntys the to preyse, amen. And sende an aungel me wyt to ken And wysdam, how that wyth-owte fere I may this wykkyd prefect answere. I see me, lord, as an innocent sheep Wyth rauennous wuluys enuyround be. Help now, good lord, &amp; from hem me keep, If it plese thy souereyn maieste.’ Whan they this herd, they gunne to fle As from a wycche, and wythinne a breyd To here lord they come, &amp; to hym thus seyd: ‘Lord, whom enhaunsyd hath fortune, And set in the estat of gret dignyte, In no wyse thy power may comune Be to hyr to whom that sent were we; For crist as hyr god, lord, wurshepyth she, And to oure goddys she nyl do seruyse, But hem blasphemyth in wundyr wyse.’ Whan Olibrius these wurdys herd, He chaungyd bothen colour and chere, And as a man mad anoon he ferd, And what he myht do he stood in dwere. And aftyr auysement he bad that nere They hyr shuld fecche, &amp; whan she come was, He hyr thus areynyd wyth a pale faas: ‘Sey me, damysel, of what kyn thou art, And whethyr thou be bonde or ellys fre. ‘Seruage in me had neuere no part, For cristene I am sekyr, sere,’ quod she. ‘I aske of what kynrede thou art,’ quod he. ‘I serue,’ she seyth, ‘that souereyn godheed That hedyr-to hath kept my maydynheed.’ ‘Than folwyth it thus ful consequently That thou clepyst crist thy god,’ quod he, ‘Whom that my fadrys dede crucyfye.’ ‘May no thyng be seyd sothere,’ quod she; ‘Thy fadrys naylyd crist vp-on a tre, Whom I do wurshepe wyth hool herte, And they in helle suffryn peynys smerte.’ Whan Olibrius herd this conclusyoun Of mayde Margarete, he wex ner wood, And to be shet in a ful strong presoun He hyr comaundyd, wych fast by stood, Euere musynge in his marryd mood How and be what maner of sotylte He myht bereuy[n] hyre hyr virginyte. Aftyr this, in ful pompous wyse He entryd into Antyoche cyte, And to his goddys maad a sacrifyse, As it was the custom of that cuntre. And on the next day comaundyd he Margrete to [be] brouth to hys presence, And thus he seyd hyr his sentence: What is the skyl and the cause why, Margarete, of thy gret cruelte, That of thy-self thou ne hast mercy, And thus wylt spylle thy gret beute? Leue al thys foly and consente to me, Be my councel, and I the wil auaunce Of gold and syluyr wyth gret habundaunce. Quod Margrete, ‘if thou, o wykkyd man, Wystyst how lytyl that I sette by Alle thy profyrs, thou woldyst not han This besynesse a-bowte me, trewly. For from the weys of trewthe neuere wyl y, But hym I wurshepe whom euery creature Dredyth, whos regne shal euere endure.’ ‘Margrete,’ quod he, ‘lyst what I seye. If thou my goddys no wurshep wylt do Wyth my swerd, sekyr, thou shalt deye. Trust me veryly, it shal be so. And if thou wylt mekely obeye me to, It shal be gretly for thy behoue, For thy body I wyl syngulerly loue.’ ‘My body,’ quod she, ‘whan euere thou lest To exercyse in me thy tyranny, Wyth holy virgynys that I may rest, To goddys sacryfyse I offre redy; For this I wyl thou knowe vttyrly, I nowyse doute, for cristys sake That for alle men deyed, deth to take.’ Whan he herd this, of gret cruelte He comaundyd hyr be hange in the eyr heye, And to betyn wyth yerdys, where whan that she Tormentyd was, to heueneward hyr eye Deuoutly she lyft, and thus dede seye: ‘In the, lord, I truste, and in thy mercy. Lete me not confoundyd be, lord, endelesly.’ And whil she thus ocupyed was in preyer, The tormentours hyr shorgyd so cruelly That lyk as watyr in a ryuer So ran hyr blood owt plenteuously. And whyl they betyn a bedel dede cry: ‘Beleue, Margarete, I counsele the, And past alle maydens weel shalt thou be.’ And not only this bedel, but eek the men And wummen also wych stood be-syde, Whan they thus seyn hyr blood owt ren, Wepyng ful sore thus on hyr they cryde: ‘Margrete, for the we sorwe this tyde! Olibrius in his ire the hastyth to spylle. Beleue hym, we counsele, &amp; lyue yet stylle!’ Whan Margrete among hyr sharp shours Of tormentrye these wurdys dede here, Quod she, ‘o ye wykkyd counselours, Men and wummen, what do ye here? Goth to your werk! for wyth-owte pere The lord that syttyth in throne ful hy Is myn helpere—this weel troste y. Also, moreouyr, I wyl ye knowe, And in youre mende doth it aduertyse, That whan Gabriel his horn doth blowe In the day of the gret and last assyse, Whan men in body &amp; soule vpryse, Than shal my soule be this torment Be sauyd from that hard iugement. Wherfore, if ye wyl sauyd be Thilk tyme, I counsel you feythfully, Alle fals goddys forsakyth ye, And leuyth in my god wych is myhty In vertu, and heryth alle men gladly Wych to hym preye puryd from vyhs, And opnyth hem the gatys of paradyhs. Alle fals goddys doth ye forsake Hastyly therfore, be counsel of me, Wych be not ellys, I vndyrtake, But gold or syluyr, stonys or tre, That goon ne mown, speke, here, ne see, Formyd be man; and if my sentence Ye not beleue, makyth experience, And ye shul weel prouyn sensybylly That they han feet &amp; mow not goon, Erys not heryng, and eyne sothly Not seyng, for in hem is noon Spyryt of lyf ner flesh ne boon On here bodyes; to swych godhede No wyhs man owyth to taken hede. Wherfore, my counsel if ye wyl do, My soule for yours, ye shul saf be. But thou, o tyraunt, wych wylt not so, And Sathanas werkys euere doost,’ quod she, Thy fadyr, and ageyn the hey maieste Of oo god berkyst as a dogge shameles, In helle thy peyne shal ben endeles.’ Olibrius, this heryng, fel in a rage, Euene as a man owt of hys mende, And bad his tormentours in that owtrage Hyr tendyr flesh to race and rende, So hopyng of hyr to maken an ende. And in this mene whyle she vp hyr eye To heuene dede lyfte, and thus gan seye: ‘Besegyd I am wyth wykkyd counsel, And many doggys han enuyround me, Wych ben ageyn me fers and cruel. Wherfore me counfort, lord, I prey the, And send down from heuene, myn helpe to be, A culuyr whyht, lord, of thy grace, Er than I deye, her in this place. And also, lord, if it plese the, I wold beseche wyth al myn herte That I myht onys myn aduersarye se Wych wyth me fyhtyth &amp; me wold peruerte, And I hym shuld make ful sore to smerte, And yeuyn exaunple be my victory Alle virgynys to truste in thy mercy.’ In the mene tyme of hyr preyer, They rent hyr flesh on euery syde So dispetously, that than a ryuer Hyr blood to grounde swyftlyere dede glyde, That the vnpetous prefect his eyne dede hyde Wyth his mantel, &amp; myht not suffre to se Blood rennyng owt so gret plente. And whan he sey hyr han swych stedfastnesse In suffraunce, ‘Margarete!’ he lowde dede crye, ‘Consente to me, and wyth hertly meknesse Wurshepe my goddys, ne hap thoue euyl dye.’ ‘Thy counsel,’ quod she, ‘I fully denye; For if I of my flesh shuld haue mercy, My soule perysh shuld, as shal thyn sothly.’ Whan he sey this, to takyn hyr down Hys tormentours from that hy iebet He bad, and in-to a ryht derk presoun He comaundyd anon she shuld be set. And euene as the clok seuene had smet, She entryd in-to that place lothly, Hyre blyssyng, and thus she seyd mekely: ‘Behold me, lord, wych am the only Doughtyr of my fader, and he hath me For the forsakyn, and so hym haue y. Hens aftyr wil thou my fadyr be! And graunt that I may myn enmy se, Wych wyth me fyhtyth, face to face, Geyn whom I not what I trespace. Of alle thyngys, lord, thou art iuge. Twyn hym and me deme ryhtfully. And for thou art only my refuge, On hym I pleyne that hurt am y And woundyd also ful greuously. Yet if thou, lord, be not wroth wyth me, I set ryht nowt be al his enmyte.’ And whil that she thus ocupyed was Ful deuoutly in hyr preyere, An huge dragoun, glasteryng as glas, Sodeynly from a corner dede apere Of the presoun, wyth an horryble chere. Hys herys were gylt, his berd was long, Hys teth of iryn were myhty &amp; strong; Owt his nosethryllys foul smoke he blew, Hys eyne glastryd as sterrys be nyht, Hys tunge ouyr his crowne he threw, In his clawys a swerd burnyshed bryth. And anoon the presoun wex ful of lyht Of the feer wych owt dede renne From his mouth &amp; fast gan brenne. Whan Margrete hym sey, ful pale of cher She was, and for very fer trewly She had foryete that god hyr preyer Had herd, in wych she thus dede cry: ‘Shew me, lord, onys myn enmy Er than I deye:’ and aftyr, thus seyd she, ‘Lete not this dragoun, lord, noyen me.’ This horrible beste vp-on hyr heed Put his mouth, whil she thus seyde, And eek his tunge, wych was fer reed Vndyr hyr hele anoon he leyde, And swelwyd hyr in euene at a breyde. And whan hyr cros in his mouth dede encrees, He brast on two, &amp; she scapyd harmlees. And whan she thus had the victory Of hym, thorgh grace of god entere, On the lefth syde euene faste hyr by Anothyr deuyl sodeynly ther gan apere, Wych on hyr dede loke wyth a lothly chere. And at the laste he thus owt abrayde Wyth a sneuelyng voys, &amp; to hyr sayde: ‘Ryht now my dere brothyr, Ruffyn, In a dragons lyknesse to the I sent And whan [he] had the hool swelwyd in, Vnwarly, er he wyst what it ment, Wyth thy wycchecraft his lyf was shent; For wyth tokne of a cros thou dedyst hym breke; Whos deth I now am come to wreke.’ As sone these wurdis as he had seyd, Be his longe herys she gan hym kecche And vndyr hyr ryht foot she hym leyd, And thus seyde: ‘o thou woful wrecche Lete be this cursyd and froward tecche My maydynheed to temte, for myn helpe sothly Is crist, whos name duryth endelesly.’ Euene at this wurd, a ful greth lyht Illumyned sodeynly that derk presoun, And a cros aperyd in heuene ful bryht, On wych a dowwe descendyd a-down, And seyde, ‘margrete!’ wyth a swete sown, ‘Alle seyntys in heuene do the abyde, And the gatys of paradyhs ben opnyd wyde.’ Than Margrete, aftyr to god dew thankyng To the fend hyr turnyd &amp; thus dede seye: ‘Telle me of whens thou art, foul thyng.’ ‘Seruaunt of crist,’ quod he, ‘I the preye Fro my nekke thy foot remeue aweye, And alle my werkys I wil the telle, Doon bothyn in erthe and eek in helle.’ Aftyr this anoon, of hyr ientylnesse, Owt of his nekke hyr foot remeue Softely she gan, and of his distresse Whan he hyr felt hym so releue, ‘Gramercy,’ he seyd, ‘&amp;, be your leue, Now wil I, lady, on-to your demaunde Answere brefly, as ye me comaunde. My surname treuly is clepyd Belchys. Sathanas oure reulere is &amp; oure kyng. And in the bookys pleynly wrytyn is Of Iamnes &amp; Mambres, oure ospryng, Oure gouernaunce, &amp; al oure werkyng. But to your purpos: if ye it lyst to here, I wyl shortly declare how we come here. Salomon, of the childryn of Israel The wysest kyng that euere was, Of vs dede shette, as storyes doon tel, Many thowsendys onys in a vessel of bras; And whan Babylonyes com in-to that plas. And wende greth tresore to haue founde, The vessels they broke, &amp; vs vnbounde. And thus, whan we vnbounnde were, Al erthe in-vyroun we dede fulfylle, Serchyng whom we myght noye &amp; dere, For this propyrte longith euere [vs] tylle.’ ‘This gouernance,’ quod she, ‘for-sothe is ylle. Wherfore go, Sathanas, hom to thy kyn.’ And wyth that wurd, the erthe swelwyd hym yn. The next day aftyr, fers Olibrius Hyr comaundyd be browt to his presence; To whom ful softly he seyd euene thus: ‘Consente, I counsel, to my sentence, And to oure goddys offre frankencence Deuouthly knelyng vp-on thy kne, And past alle wummen I wil loue the.’ ‘Laboure,’ quod she, ‘no more in veyn, But take this answere euene for fynal: Thy goddys neuere wurshepe shal I certeyn, Ner be thy loue I set ryht nowt at al; For not longe hereaftyr deye thou shal, And aftyr thy deth be beryed in helle, Wherfore wyth the me not lyst to melle.’ Whan Olibrius herd this, he gan to crye, ‘Tormentours! tormentours!’ as he wood were, ‘Wyth glowyng ferbrondys faste you hye, This wycchys sydys to brenne &amp; sere As longe as ye ony flesh fynde there! And whan she weel warmyd is in this wyse, In fayr cold watyr doth hyre baptyse.’ As he comaundyd doon was anoon, That very pete it was it to beholde How on bothe sydys, euene to the boon, Hyr flesh was brent wyth brondys manyfolde, And aftyr, boundyn, how in-to watyr colde They hyr kest, that this chaung sodeyne From hete to cold shuld encrecyn hyr peyne. But god, his seruauntys wych neuere forsake Wil, ner suffre hem to myscheue, Sodeynly maad the erthe to quake, And queynt the fyr that hyr dede greue, And so in the watyr hyr dede releue, That vnboundyn &amp; harmles she cam owte, Wych wundyr was to hem that stood abowte. For wych miracle fyue thousand anoon Were there conuertyd and martyrd also; And whan Olibrius sey the mater thus goon, Bethynkyng what best was for to do, And dredyng more peple wold turne hyr to If she lengere lyuyd, wyth-owte more let Sentencyd hyr heed of to be smet. Of wych sentence ful glad she was, Hauyng ful trust in goddys goodnesse, And whan she was brouth in-to the plas Where she shuld receyuyn hyr iuwesse, Fully repleuyshed wyth cherytabylnesse, Malchus she preyid, wyth humble chere, Of leyser to make a short preyere. And whan he hyr had grauntyd space, She set hyr down on eythyr kne, An vpward to heuene lyftyng hyr face, Thus gan for to preye: ‘in eternyte O lord euere regnyng, haue mercy on me. And for thy gret pyte, o blyssyd Ihesu, There trespas foryeue that me pursu. More-ouyr, lord, lowly I the beseche For them specyally that my passyoun Othyr rede, or wryte, or other do teche, Or cherche or chapel make if they moun, Or lyht or launpe fynde of deuocyoun To me-ward: lord, for thy gret grace, Hem repentaunce graunte er they hens pace. Also if wummen in trauayyng be Oppressyd wyth peyne &amp; greuaunce, And for helpe deuoutly do preye to me, Graunth hem sone good deliueraunce. And generally, lord, in ony male-chaunce, If to me for socour men calle &amp; crye, Graunt hem sone counfort &amp; remedye.’ Whan she thus endyd had hyr preyere, Sodeynly from heuene this voys cam down, So lowde that alle men myht it here: ‘Herd is, Margarete, thyn orysoun, And grauntyd, that who wyth deuocyoun In ony dyshese doth preye to the, For thy sake sothly he herd shal be.’ And wyth this wurd hyr face to Malchus She turnyd, &amp; seyde wyth ful glad cher: ‘Brothyr, that the do bad Olibrius, Now to performe do thy deuer, For I not lengere what to doon her.’ And Malchus anoon wythowte more let Euene at oo strok hyr heed of smet. But vnnethe hyr body sonere to grounde Fel, than hyr soule was in heuene blys. Now, gloryous lady, lete thy pyte habounde, Oure soulys to brynge wher thy soule ys, For than of ioye shul we neuere mys, Whedyr vs mote brynge the holy trynyte. Sey eche man Amen, pur cheryte. Lo, sone, now haf I acomplysyd Brefly, lych as I you promysyd In the prologe, aftyr the story Of the legende, euene by &amp; by, The byrthe, the fostryng &amp; the successyoun Of lyf, and eek fynally the passyoun, Of seynt Margrete, the blyssyd virgyne, So as vouchedsaf to illumyne My wyt &amp; my penne the heuenely grace. And now of you I aske leyser &amp; space Of reste a whyle, for certeynly Euene as a pilgrym so fare now y, That feyntly walkyth be the weye, And neythyr lyst to iape ner pleye, Ne talke ne synge ne make no cher, Til to his herberwe he gynne drawe ner.

But whan he suppyd hath a good meel And slept ynow and restyd hym weel, And on the morwe doth erly ryse, Than fynt he hymself in sundry wyse More strong to performyn his iourne. Ryht so, as I seyde, it faryth be me; For sykyr myn handys gynne to feynte, My wyt to dullyn, and myn eyne bleynte Shuld be, ner helpe of a spectacle; My penne also gynnyth make obstacle, And lyst no lengere on paper to renne, For I so ofte haue maad to grenne Hys snowte vp-on my thombys ende, That he ful ny is waxyn vnthende; For euere as he goth he doth blot, And in my book makyth many a spot, Menyng therby that for the beste Were for vs bothe a whyle to reste, Til that my wyt and also he Myht be sum craft reparyd be. Wherfore, sone, of your ientylnesse, Respyht vs bothyn tyl myhylmesse; And that is not longe, as I thus preue, For this day is seynt Mathevs eue, And to-forn myhilmesse but the tente day, Aftyr wych tyme treuly I wil assay, If god vouchesaf of his specyal grace Of lyf me graunte leyser and space.

Andronicus hyht that prynce sothly, Wych, whil that Eusebye absent was, As I seyd to-fore, be tyranny Vsurpyd the pryncehood of that plas; Wherof fel a ful heuy caas; For thorgh there tweynys debat &amp; stryf Ful many a man dede lese hys lyf. The processe to declare were to long, And it askyth ful many a circumstaunce To telle clerly how gret wrong This prynce dede, &amp; to what myschaunce The cyte he brouth thorgh mysgouernaunce, And be what treytourye his sone-in-lawe, Sinward, be nyht he brouth a-dawe. I wyl not tellyn now what accyoun He feynyd the patryark to pursu, And how &amp; be what similat faccyoun Meche peple to hys fauour he dreu. Wherfore, prolyxyte to escheu, I wil lete passe al maner disgressyoun, An shortly goon on to the conclusyoun. Whan of Antyoche thorg his surquydy Ner destroyd was the fayr cyte Wyth feer &amp; swerd ful cruelly, Many a fayr cherche ther brent he, That reuthe &amp; pyte it was to se; Among wych of seynt Margarete was oon, Wherof he left nei[þ]ir stykke ne stoon. In this seyd cherche was an abbeye, A solemne of munkys, whil that it stood, Of wych the abot was, as cronycles seye, That tyme a religyous man &amp; good, Austyn be name, &amp; of nobyl blood, Born in a cuntre clepyd lumbardye, And of a cyte callyd Pauye. Whan this Austyn sey the gret mischef Bothe of the cyte and of his abbeye And the impossybylnesse it to relef, Hys spyryt ner went from hym aweye; Hym thowte he yaf no fors to deye. And whan he thus longe had stonde confush, At last in hymself he thus dede muse: ‘I am but a foreyn in this cuntre, And haue here no frend me to auayle. Werfore me thynkyth it best for me Ageyn to returne in-to Itayle, Wher of good frenshepe I may not fayle, For ther is the issu of my genealogye, And specyally in the cyte of Papye.’ And whan in this purpos he fyxyd was, Hys owe cuntre to goon hom to, He kest to caryin owt of that plas The bodyes of holy virgynys two, Seynt Margarete &amp; seynt Euprepye also, To profyht of the cherche, &amp; eek honour In Pauye of seynt Sire the confessour. For lernyd he hadde ful secretlye Of a prest in his last confessyoun, Vbald be name, whan he shuld dye, Wych was a man of gret deuocyoun, How of seynt Margrete he fynde shuld moun The body, &amp; where that it dede rest, Of gold &amp; syluyr in a fayr chest. And for he myht not a-lone do That he desyryd, of his men tweyne Pryuyly oo tyme he clepyd hym to, Wych Lucas &amp; Robert were clepyd certeyne, And feythfully of hem he gan to freyne If they to hym wold trewe men be, And wyth hym goon hom to his cuntre. And if they wold so, he them there hyht Of gold an tresore gret habundaunce, And that he shulde doon al hys myht Wyth sporys gylt hem bothe to auaunce, And that they shulde ryde wyth spere &amp; launce; And they hym assuryd wyth scrypture &amp; seel, Euere cloos to kepyn al hys counseel. ‘Felawys,’ quod he, ‘treuly myn entent Meuyd is euene of pure deuocyoun, Owt of this place wych is her brent, And browt as ye see to gret desolacyoun, Of summe relykys to make a translacyoun, And specyally of that blyssyd &amp; holy virgyne Seynt Margarete, an in Pauye hem do shryne.’ Whan they thys herde, wyth ryht glad cher Fully they approuyd al his entent, And seyden, whan-euere in this mater He wolde procede, they shuld assent. ‘For here,’ quod they, ‘it arn but shent. Wherfore to performyn this holy decre We trowe that god hath inspyryd the.’ And sone aftyr this they cam alle thre Pryuyly be nyhte on-to the place Where Austyn had lernyd this relykys hyd be Of seynt Margarete, be goddys grace, And anoon so depe they dede in race Tyl at the laste a chest they founde Wyth iryn and bras myhtyly bounde. And euene wythowte was this scripture Wrytyn abouyn vp-on the chest: ‘Here wyth-inne, of the virgyne pure Seynt Margarete the body doth rest.’ And wyth-oute let they it al to-brest, And in a syluerene vessel, wyth gemmys freshly Arayed, they founde this blyssyd body. Wych whan they seyn they were ful glad, And anoon tokyn it vp ful reuerently, And to a mannys hous preuyly it lad Wych Austyn the abot louyd enterly, Crisper be name, wych dwellyd ther ny— But what they brouht they nold hym telle— Wher foure dayis aftyr they dede dwelle. In wych mene tyme they maad hem redy In hasty wyse to takyn forth her iourne; But the sylueren ark they broke, sothly, And trussyd the body in a loker of tre, That of tresore shuld no suspycyoun be. And, aftyr leue takyn, to shyp they went, And god of his grace hem fayr speed sent. For anoon, wyth-owtyn eythyr peryl or feer, To the port of Brundusye they dede applye, And whan they weel had refresshyd hem ther, Anoon thre hors they dedyn hem bye, And forth to Rome they hem faste dede hye, Wher dylygently and wyth deuocyoun They labouryd to purchasyn holy pardoun. And whan they ful ner dayes fyftene Hemself wyth a deuouth carage Had exercysyd, and maad ful clene, And goon to many an holy stage, Of the reed flyx the gret owtrage Sodeynly dede Austyn so sore oppresse That to deyin he trowyd of that seeknesse. Wherfore, as goodly as he cowde or myht, Seyng no lyklynesse to ben amendyd, Of hys host he took his leue that nyht, And payid for al that he had dispendyd. On morwe, whan he hym had commendyd To petyr and poule, his hors he nam, And vnnethe that nyht to Souters cam. Wyth gret labour they come the nexte day On-to the cherche of blyssyd vyctory The virgyne, wych stant, as men se may, In the hey weye, venus halle by, Wher they hym receuyd ful honestly, Wych tyme as shuld the solemnyzacyoun Been of that cherche the fyrst dedycacyoun, Wych on the seuente day dede falle Of octobre, euene as there wrytyn is, Where Austyn offryd vp in a palle Oon of seynt Margaretys rybbys; And whan the peple ther dwellyng sey this, They it receyuyd wyth ful glad cher, And in hyr honour dede halwe a auter. Fro whens, wyth-inne dayis two, Wyth gret syknesse whan they dede pace, In the vale Palantes they come to Of seynt Petyr a relygyous place Of munkys blake, and bonyface The Abot hyht, wher wurshepfully Austyn was receyuyd &amp; cherytabylly. And whan he sey that his seeknesse Eche day encrecyd more and more, And cowd see no weye of lyklynesse To ascapyn, anoon he sent fore The Abot Bonyface, &amp; wepyng ful sore, To hym, in presence of his hool couent, He pleynly declaryd thus hys entent: ‘Allas!’ quod he, ‘euene as a straunger And as vnknowyn also in this cuntre, Ineuytabylly I must deyin her, For alwey encrecyth myn infyrmyte. Nertheles, vertu of necessyte I wyl make, and therfore now To god my soule I commende &amp; to yow. More-ouyr also, I wil ye wete Two precyous relykys I her haue wyth me; That is to seyne, of seynt Margrete The body, and of the vyrgyne fre, Euprepye, the heed, in a cophyn of tre, Wyche from Antyoche I haue brouth, And to Pauye them led it was my thouth. But syth I see deth me faste nyhe to, And I to lyue may haue no lengere space, Whil my wyttys be fresch &amp; my mynde also, This relykys I yeue to this holy place, You therfore askynge this oonly grace, That ye for me wil preyn specyally, And therto my annyuersarye kepyn yerly.’ Whan they herd thys, god principally They thankyd and hym wyth herte entere, And that he desyryd so deuouthly They hym grauntyd wyth ful glad chere, And anoon alle the munkys in fere Te deum laudamus deuo[u]thly sunge, And alle here bellys ful solemnely runge. And the abot copyd, wyth his munkys alle, Wyth torchys &amp; tapyrs brennyng ful cler, These precyous relykys, curyd wyth a palle, Bar and set vp on the hey awter; And eyghte dayis aftyr, wyth ful glad cher, They maad greth feste &amp; solemnyte, And meche peple thydyr it cam to see. In wych mene tyme this blyssyd man, Austyn, wych that yaf on-to that place These holy relikys, whan he had tan Alle hys ryhtys, to goddys grace He commendyd his soule, &amp; hens dede pace, The sextend kalendys, as wrytyng doth preue, Of Nouembyr, euene on seynt lukys eue. And whan they his dirige in goodly maner Had seyd, to here cherche ful relygyously Hys body they bore, &amp; besydyn an awter Of seynt Blase it beryid ful wurshepfully, And aftyrward hem besyid riht diligently To performyn vp the solemnyzacyoun Of these holy seyd relikys translacyoun. For thow kalixtys day, martyr &amp; pope, Wych fallyth of Octobyr the threttend day, As be old wrytynge I vndyrgrope, The fyrst day were of this solemne aray, Wych reuelacyoun or translacyoun clepyd be may Of seynt Margretys body, yet eyghte days more They solemne kept, as seyd is before. In wych eyghte dayis ther god wrowt Manye grete miraclys, as I wrytyn haf see. Albe-it for hast that I reherce hem nowt, Or for to other thyngys I wold spede me, And also to eschewyn prolixyte, Stepdam of fauour, aftyr the sentence In a vers of Mathu Vindocinence. But for-as-meche as nothyng perpetuel Is in this werd, ne stabyl in oo staat, For the grete werrys that sone aftyr fel In thylk cuntre, thorgh stryf &amp; debat Of sundry cytees, this place desolat Wyth-inne fewe yerys was, &amp; stood aloon, Whos dwellers thens for feer dede flen euerychon. Sone aftyr this, whan it was knowe That this abbeye was in swych desolacyoun, And be the trumpet of fame aboute blowe, The Ruuyllyans madyn a congregacyoun, And alle the clerkys gadryd in processyoun Of oure ladyis cherche, and wyth gret reuerens Seynt Margaretes body they fecchyd thens. And whan they had this body brout Into oure ladyes cherche wyth solemnyte, In tablys of marbyl, coryously wrout, They it shrynyd wyth seynt Felycyte, Whos feste fallyth, as men may se, Wyth seynt Clement, and, as I remembre, It is the nynte kalende of Decembre. Where, whan these two virgyns in sam An hundryd yer or more had shrynyd leyn, Swych myschef to Ruyllyan cam That down it was bete &amp; maad pleyn; And so longe it so abood, certeyn, And wyth trees &amp; buschys so wylde grew, That where it was anethe ony knew. But whan it plesyd the souereyn goodnesse Of god, wych syt in heuene aboue, To delyuyrn owt of that wyldyrnesse These two virgyns wych he dede loue, To counfort of meche folk &amp; behoue, He chees a persone of straunge cuntre Of there translacyoun mynystyr to be. Whan the yer of grace on the noumbyr ran Of a thousand foure hundryd and fyue, The fyrst yer of the secund Vrban, The pope of Rome, as cronycles dryue, And Herry the thredde was alyue, And had the sool reule of the empere, This reuelacyoun maad was that ye shul here. wyx Naplys, that tyme, and Teracyne, In a wode of the Markeys of that cuntre, Two hermytys dwellyd, whom god illumyne Vouchydsaf wyth grace in that degre To lyuyn, and his seruauntys to be. Ion hyht the toon, to whom dede appere Seynt Margrete, seyng on this manere: ‘Ion, goddys seruaunt, as fast as thou kan, On myn erand mounth Flask go to, And vn-to the pryour of seynt Flauyan, Wych is ther clepyd Burgundio, And sey hym, god wil that he his deuer do, That neythyr I ner seynt Felycyte In solytarye place lengere lefth be.’ ‘Who art thou,’ quod Ion, ‘that spekyst to me, And byddyst me doon that I ne kan?’ ‘I am Margrete, goddis handmayde,’ quod she, ‘That in Antyoche dede martyrdam tan Vndyr fers Olybrye, wych prefect was than. But whan that cyte wyth scysme was ner nowt, Oon Austyn to Tuskayne fro thens me browt.’ ‘Lady,’ quod Ion, ‘I not knowe that place, Ner in what maner cuntre it is.’ ‘Kare not,’ quod she, ‘for whil that grace Of god the guydyth, thou mayst not mys; For, wher-euere thou go, it shal the wys, And al that longyth to thy necessyte Shal be prouydyd be god and me.’ Whan Ion this herd, wyth-owte lettyng He tok his felawe and gan hym forth hye Vp-on his iurne, fully trostyng That the grace of god shuld hym riht gye. And so it dede, for ryht sone sothlye To mounth flask he cam, where she ageyn To hym apperyd, and thus dede seyn: ‘Go, sey the pryour that he sende hastly To ruuyllyan, wych now is wildyrnesse, And to the place where of seynt Mary The cherche was; &amp; there, wyth besynesse Of deluyng, they shul fynden expresse In tablys of marbyl, wyth a scripture, My body &amp; felicites, I hem ensure.’ And anoon Ion to the pryour went, And gan hym tellen euene by and by Of whom &amp; why he thedyr was sent, And preyd hym to performyn it hastyly; For, were it doon, he hym hom wold hy. But he no credens yaf to his talkyng; Wherfore Ion went a-wey wepyng. He was ful sory that he had lost So meche labour, hym thoute, in veyn. And as he went homward to his ost, In the opyn strete seynt Margrete ageyn Apperyd to hym &amp; thus dede seyn: ‘Ion, be not heuy, but ayen hym to Go, and eftsonys thyn herand doo.’ ‘I-wis, lady,’ quod Ion, ‘he nyl credens In no wyse my wurdys yeue to.’ ‘Yet go!’ quod she, ‘and, er thou come thens, He shal wyth grace inspiryd be so Happyly that he shal assente to do Lych as thou seyst, &amp; hold the trewe; Or ellys forsothe he shal it rewe.’ ‘Lady,’ quod he, ‘in this matere Me thynkith best were—saf youre reuerence— That ye youreself to hym dede appere, And shewyd hym pleynly youre sentence; For than he nedys must yeue credence.’ ‘Nay, Ion,’ quod she, ‘nay, god wyl not so. But be the he wyl this massage be do.’ Whan Ion herd this &amp; othere also Wych stood besydyn, ful many oon, Herdyn this talkyng betwyx hem to, They seyde they wold wyth hym goon On-to the Pryour, and that anoon, And of alle these wurdis, bothe more &amp; lesse, Pleynly they wold hym bere wytnesse. Whan this was doon, the priour dede leue Ionys wordys, &amp;, wyth-owte lettyng, The treuthe herof that he myht preue, Men thedyr he sent to make serchyng; And they there labouryd in deluyng In the cherche paument fro morwe tyl eue, But they founde nowt—that dede hem greue. And anoon for angyr they hom ageyn Turnyd, and seyde euene thus to Ion: ‘Thou hast vs maad to labouren in veyn, For of oure labour fruht is come noon.’ ‘Serys,’ quod he, ‘yif ye lyst to goon Ageyn wyth me, be goddys grace I shal yon brynge euene to the place.’ They folwyd his wyl &amp; turnyd ageyn, And, al-be-it he neuere cam there to forn, ‘Here is the place,’ quod he, ‘certeyn, Where growe brymblys &amp; many a thorn. Here shal I hope no labour be lorn.’ Wher they dede delue, &amp; wyth-inne a stounde, More than they sowten ther they founde. For wyth the bodyes of the virgyns two, Felycyte an eek Seynt Margarete, Thre rybbys ther they foundyn also Of Cosme &amp; Damyan, smellyng ful swete; And an epitaphye of marbyl was wrete On this wyse: ‘lo! her in this chest Margretys body &amp; felicites doth rest.’ Whan they this seyn, wyth gret gladnesse To mounth Flask anoon they wurd sent, And thanne the priour wyth gret besynesse Gadryd a processyoun and thedyr went, And them hom to brynge was dylygent. And al the pepyl folwyd ful besyly, Syngynge and preyng deuouthly. And whil they thus ocupyed in syngyng were, Sodeynly nyht hem dede a-take, And anoon they went they wyst not where, And euere more grew mo clowdys blake, And they for feer tremelyng gunne quake, And wyth oo voys they lowde dede cry, ‘Seynt Margarete, on vs now haue mercy!’ And anoon, as they thus preyd had, A gret bryhtnesse ouyr hem dede sprede, As thow heuene euene opyn ben had; Wych to mounth Flask ryht dede hem lede. And euere as they forth dede procede, The lyht went euene wyth hem sothly, Tyl they come vp in the toun on hy. And whan they come beforn the hous Of oon that Beucase men dede calle, These reliquys so heuy &amp; so ponderous Dede growe anoon, that vnder hem alle Myht them not beryn past his stalle; Wherfore men conceyuyd that they lest In that place stylle abydyn &amp; rest. Vp-on wych they alle in fere To Beucase seyde: ‘syth god wyl That a cherche shuld be maad here For these relykys, thyn hows ther-tyl Yiue vp, we counsel, wyth good wyl. And if thou wy[l] not so, we wyl it bye, Or yeue the a bettyr therfore, treulye.’ Beucase seyd nay, it shuld not be. And sodeynly began swych a tempest Of thundyr &amp; leuene, that dayes thre It contunyd stylle &amp; neuere dede rest. Whan Beucase thys sey, hym thouth it best To take a-nothyr and hys hous relece; And so he dede, &amp; the tempest gan sece. Aftyr this, in ful solemne wyse In-to that hous the relikys they bere; And as goodly as they cowde deuyse, Anoon a cherche they dede make there. In wych yet restyn, as I dede lere, The bodyes of the two virgynys swete, Seynt Felicyte &amp; eek seynt Margarete. Many a myracle ther shewyd was, In the tyme of thys translacyoun, And ofte sythyn hath ben, in that holy plas, Wych to wrytyn were gret ocupacyoun; For sekyrly, aftyr myn estymacyoun, If they were wrytyn, it contune more Wold than al the remnaunth before. This secunde translacyoun of the virgyn swete Treuly, as I me now kan remembre, I mene the blyssyd martyr Margarete, The seuenetende day was of Nouembre, And the fyftende Kalende of Decembre, Wych day entytlyd is in-to the honour Of gloryous Huhe, byschop &amp; confessour. Now, blyssyd virgyne, wych at Mounth Flaske Lyist shrynyd in a ful fayr awter Graunth me the bone that I now aske: Fyrst, that I may purchase pardone her Of alle my synnys, and aftyr, partener Of the ioye be wher thou doost dwelle, Wych how gret is no tunge kan telle.[The rest of f. 26, and the whole of the two following folios are blank.] Amen. Vita Scæ Annæ matris Scæ Mariae Prologus. IF I hadde cunnyng and eloquens My conceytes craftely to dilate, Als whilom dede the fyrsh rethoryens, Gowere, Chauncere, &amp; now Lytgate, I wolde me besyn to translate Seynt anne lyf in-to oure langage. But sekyr I fere to gynne so late, Lest men wolde ascryuen it to dotage. For wel I know that fer in age I am runne, &amp; my lyues date Aprochith fast, &amp; the fers rage Of cruel deth—so wyl my fate Ineuytable—hath at my gate Set hys carte to carye me hens; And I ne may ne can, thau I hym hate, Ageyn hys fors make resistens. Wherfore me thinkyth, &amp; sothe it ys, Best were for me to leue makynge Of englysh, &amp; suche as ys amys To reformyn in my lyuynge. For that ys a ryght souereyn cunnynge: A man to knowen hys trespasce, Wyth ful purpos of amendynge, As ferforth as god wyl grawnte hym grace. For whil a man hath leysere and space Here in þis wordlys abydynge, Or than that deth his brest enbrace, To ransake his lyf in alle thynge, And wyth his conscience to make rekenynge &amp; ryhtyn ageyn al þat wronge is, He may not fayle, at his partynge Owt of his lyf, to gon to blys. Neuerthelesse, onto þe souereyn goodnesse Of ihesu I truste &amp; of marie His moder fre, thow I my besynesse Do diligently to claryfye Her moderes lyf &amp; hyr genalogye, To excyten wyth mennys deuocyon, Aftyr the'ntent of the storye, They wyl accepten myn entencyon. For treuly I make a protestacyon To seynt anne &amp; to hyr dowter marye, That yf eythyr errour in myn opynyon Geyn good maners, or heresye A-geyn the feyth I cowde aspye Wythe alle diligence &amp; besynesse Alle my wyttes I wolde applye It to reforme &amp; to redresse. But ere than I ferther forthe procede In this matere, I lowly beseche Alle that schul thys story rede That they loke aftyr no coryous speche, For tullyus wolde me neuer non teche, Ner in parnase wher apollo doth dwelle I neuer slepte, ne neuer dede seche In ethna flowrs, wher, as claudian doþe telle, Proserpina was rapt; nor of þe sugird welle In elicona, my rudnesse to leche, I neuer dede taste, to me so felle Wher euer the muses, &amp; þe cruel wreche Of orpheus, whiche hys wyf dede seche In helle, of me wolde neuer take hede, Nor of his armonye oo poynt me teche In musical proporcyon rymes to lede. ?et not-forthan I wyl not blynne, For your sake, my frende denston kateryne, Lyche as I can this story to begynne, If grace my penne vochesaf to illumyne. Preyth ye enterly þat blyssed virgyne, Whiche of seynt anne þe dowter was, That she vouchesaf som beem lat shyne vp-on me of hyr specyal grace, And þat I may haue leyser &amp; spaas, Thorgh help of influence dyuyne, To oure bothe confort &amp; solace This legende begunne for to termyn, Or than deth the threed vntwyne Of oure fatal web, whiche is ryht thynne And saue vs bothe from endles pyne, And here vs kepe from shame &amp; synne. O perles prencesse, of uirginyte Synguler gemme, whiche in eche nede Art euer redy helper to be To them that the for grace to grede! Entende, lady, of thy womanhede To my prayer, and me soccour Whiche purpose of thy kynrede Sum-what to seyn, thorghe thy fauour, And specyally on-to the honour Of thy modyr; whiche, as I rede, Rote was of the, o most swet floure And wyth hyr mylke dede foster &amp; fede The ful thre yer, &amp; aftyr dede lede On-to the temple, &amp; ther offerde the. Now, lady, graunt to me mede In blysse eterne yow bothe to se. [One blank line.] Aftyr the reulys of interpretacyon, Anne is as myche to seyn as ‘grace’. And worthyly thys appellacyon To hyr pertenyth, for wyth-in the space Of hyr wombe sche dede enbrace, Here that is of grace the welle Lady of erthe &amp; empresse of helle. I mene that blyssed &amp; holy virgyne, Modyr of ihesu oure sauyour, Marye, of synners souereyn medycyne, And in alle dystresse synguler soccour Aftyr hyr sone; &amp; of this floure Whiche is so redolent &amp; so soote This gracyous anne was stoke &amp; rote; The whiche is commendyde, as I do rede, Of thynges thre most syngulerly: Ferst of hyr nobyl &amp; royal kynrede, Conueyede from dauid down lyneally; Of perfyht leuynge also, and fynally Of plenteuous fruht; &amp; ysachar hyr fadyr Was clepyd, &amp; nasaphath hyht hyr modyr. As for þe fyrst, I wil ye knowe, Be doctryne of scripture whiche wyl not lye, Dauid in ierusalem hade on a rowe Fowre sones be oon cleped bersabee, Whilom the wyf of wurthy vrye. But to oure purpoos, the thryde hyht Salomon, &amp; the fowrthe nathan be ryht. More-ouyr I wyl ye know also, As ierom &amp; damascen do testifye, The custome of scripture not vsyth, lo, Of wymmen to wryte the genealogye; Wherfore, as þe lyne of marye Is knowe be ioseph &amp; non othyr wyse, So is annes be ioachym, as þey two deuyse. Also for more cler vndurstondynge Of þis genealogyal descencyon, I wil ye wyte that for no thynge The olde law wold suffre permixtyon Of sundry kynredes, for whiche conclusyon Ioachym toke anne of hys ny alye, And ioseph was streyned to wedde mary. These thyngys knowen, lyst what I mene: Of nathan longe aftyr descended leuy, Whiche of his wyf estha, seyth damescen Too sones gat, pantar &amp; melchy; Pantar gat barpantar, &amp; he lyneally Ioachym, whiche that husbonde was To anne, the moder of oure solas. On þat oþer syde down descendynge From salomon euen vnto mathan, Cam iacob, aftyr matheus wrytynge, But, as damascen wyl declare can, Melchy, of the lyne of nathan, Pantars brother, &amp; þe sone of leuy, Weddyd iacobes modyr &amp; gat ely. So iacob &amp; ely were brethern vteryne, Thow iacob of salmon &amp; ely cam of nathan, And whan ely issules his lyf dede fyne, Iacob, to reyse his brother seed, dede tan Hys wyf, as comannded the lawe than, And gat ioseph, spouse to marye. Lo, þus endyth þis double genealogye. And yf yt lyke on-to moralyte To draw [þ]e names of the progenytours Of marye, chef gemme of uirginyte, Of helful doctryne ful redolent flours We schul fynde, of ryht swete odowrs, Yf we hem dewly kun applye, And ordenelly aftyr the ethimologye. Aftyr [þ]e sentence of the holy doctour Seynt austyn, dauid dowth signyfye ‘The souereyn heuenely progenytour,’ And salomon, ‘pesyble’, aftyr ethimologye, ‘The prince of pees’, betoknyth sothly, Whom the fadyr down sent pees to make, Perfyth oure kynde whann he dyde take. Be nathan, dauid sone also; ‘?yfth’ or ‘thynge ?ouyn’ is signyfyed, Be whom descens leuy is made to, And ‘taken vp’ betoknyth, or ‘applyed’ Where-in we be mystyly certyfyed That be hem oure nature assumpt shul be To the secunde persone of [þ]e trinite. Bvt yet had it not ben sufficyent The vptakyng of oure frele nature Whiche wyth synne was almost schent, But recuryd had ben oure brosure, And he venguyshd þat causyd þe lesure; Wherfore in [þ]e ordyr of oure reparacyon Descens is to iacob, toknynge ‘supplantacyon’. Iacob supplanted hys brother esau, Whiche toknythe ‘row’ or ellys ‘hery’, And it signifyeth þat oure lorde ihesu Supplanted the deuyl, oure ruggyd enmye, Whan he on [þe] crocse ful schamfully Heng nakyd, fastnyd wyth nayles smerte, And wyth a scharpe spere stunge to þe herte. Aftyr iacob, ioseph, as seyth þe text, In descence of the genealogye, Whiche toknyth ‘encres’ stondyth next, Spouse of annes doughter marie, Modyr of ihesu, whiche to sygnyfie ‘A byttyr see’ and ‘saluacyon’; Where-of, lo, a bref moralizacyon: Ioseph, encrescynge in goodnesse, Must wedde marye, the bytter see Of penaunce, be constant stabylnesse; And yf anne penaunces modyr be Whiche toknyth ‘grace’ &amp; ‘charyte’, He schal conceyuen be the humble vertu Saluacyon, tokned be þis name ihesu. Now haue I shewed more compendyously Than it owt haue ben þis noble pedegre. But in þat myn auctour I folow sothly, And also to eschewyn prolyxite. And for my wyt is schort, as ye may se, To the secunde part I wyl me hye Of my processe, &amp; annes lyf descrye. Thys blyssud anne of þe blode royal, Als to-forn is s[e]yde, of dauid [þ]e kynge, In a cyte þat bedleem men calle, Was born &amp; hade hyr fyrst fostrynge In alle that myht to vertu hyr brynge, As diligently as hyr fadyr cowd do, Isachar, &amp; nazaphat hyr modyr also. And whan she to ?eris of dyscrescyon Was comyn, aftyr ther lawes guyse, Not ouer yonge aftyr myn estymacyon, But what yer of age I ne can deuyse, Wedded sche was in ful solenne wyse Into a cuntre clepyd galyle And to a man a-cordyng to hyr degre, I mene to ioachym, in the cyte Off nazareth dwellynge &amp; of dauid hows, A ryche man &amp; of gret dignyte, Whos lyf of youthe was euer vertuous, Symple, ryhtfulle &amp; eke petous, Aforne god &amp; man ryht comendable, To whom Anne was wyf ful couenable, For aftyr the doctryne of philosophye [In] ihesus syrach, whoso it rede can, Lyche to lyche euere doth applie, As scheep to scheep &amp; man to man, Pertryche to pertryche &amp; swan to swan So vertu to vertu is agreable; Werfore anne to ioachym was wyf ful able. For liche as they in ther yunge age Were bothne forthe browthe vertuously, Ryght so, conioyned be maryage Whan þey were, more diligently In vertush they grew; &amp; cause is why— For, as longe to-forne be a poete was tolde, What newe shelle taketh it sauouryth olde. And for they wolde lyuen conformely To goddes plesaunce, here possessyoun They deuyded on partes thre treuly; The ferst they youen wyth deuocyon To the temple, þe secunde to sustentacyon Of pylgrimys &amp; pore men seek &amp; olde; The thrydde they kept for her howsholde. Thus ryhtful to god &amp; to man petous Twenty wynter þey lyued wyth-out issw, In chast maryage and not vycyous. And thow of here seed no fruht grew, ?et to god for grace they dede pursew At hys temple thryes in the yere Wyth offrynge &amp; wyth deuouht prayer, And maden vowes wyth holy entent That yf god wolde of his specyal grace Ony fruht hem sende, þey wolde it present. Were it man or woman, beforn hys face, Euen in the temple, þat holy place, Ther hem to sence bothe clene &amp; pure As longe ther-of as they had cure. Long aftyr, vpon a festful day, Clepyd of [þ]e temple the dedycacyon, Ioachym in his best aray To ierusalem went wyth deuocyoun To make his ofrynge as he was woun, Wyth other burgeys of hys cyte, Eche man as longyd to hys degre. At þat tyme byschop was Isakar In the temple, as tellyth [þ]e story. And whan he amonge oþer was war Of ioachym, stondynge ful sturdyly, He h[y]m rebukyde, &amp; askyde why He þat bareyn and frutles was Presumyde to apperen in that plas. ‘Thy yiftes,’ quod he, ‘ben vnworthy, And to god no þinge acceptable. For þis I wyl þu knowe pleynly, That bareynesse to god is reprouable, And cursed is yche man &amp; condempnable, As holy scripture vs doth telle, That no fruht forth bryngþe in israele. Werfore, ioachym, I charge the Neuere aftyr vse þis presumpcyon Here to offre, tyl assoylled þu be Of þis legal malediccyoun. And whan þu hast get an absolucyon Of þis curs and hast fecundyte, Than shul they yiftes acceptable be.’ Whan ioachym þus rebukyde was Of þe byschop in þe temple opynly, He was so aschamyd of þat caas That agyn hom he nolde goon pleynly, Ne hap his neybures which dwellyd hym by Hym wolde repreue anothyr day; And þerfore he toke al a-nother way, And to his herdemen he dede hym hye, Which in wyldernesse fer dede pasture That tyme his schep ful diligently, Which in t[h]oo dayes were his most cure, For wyth þat encrecyde of here genderin[g]e He &amp; his wyf were wonte to fede Pore folke whiche god dede loue &amp; drede. Whyl ioachym hym þus dede ocupye Abou?t his scheep in wast wyldyrnesse, And anne his spouse cowde non aspye Of hym tydynges, neyþer more ne lasse, Ful monythes fyue, wyth gret trestesse Oppressede &amp; prostrat she gan to preye, And in here prayer she þus dede saye: ‘O souerayne euerelastynge maieste, Whiche hast been euere &amp; be schal Regnynge in stable eternyte, Whos regne may neyþer bowe ne fal, To whom eeke eche creature mortal Must obey—now, lorde, in þis nede, Vp-on me rew for thy nobylhede! A, lorde of israle most myhty, Syth þu no chylderne hast youe me to, What haue I trespascyd geyn thy mercy That þus my spouse þu takyst me fro? For ful fyue monythes be passyd &amp; go Syth I of hym had no tydynge, Wether he be dede or ellys lyuynge. Now help me, lorde, I the beseche, And graunte me grace to haue knowynge Were I myht my husbonde seche; For yf I knew where, wyth-owt letynge I wolde hym seke, yf he were lyuynge, And yf he ded were, his sepulture I wolde enbelshyn wyth besy cure. For, lorde, þu knowyst how affecteuously I hym now loue and euere haue do, Syth we fyrst knyt were lawfully, Past alle creatures; lorde, helpe me so! And yf [þ]e knot be now vn-do Of oure spousayle, I noon but the Know, lorde, that may my confort be.’ Whan she þes wordes &amp; many mo, Which at þis tyme I ne can expresse, Had seyd sobbynge for very wo And sykynge for hertys byttyrnesse In-to an herber she can hyre dresse Besyden hyr hows, &amp; ther certayn Hyre prayer hertly she made ageyn. And whan she roos from hyr prayer And casuelly lyftyde vp hyr eye, In a fayr, fresh &amp; grene laurere A sparow fedynge hyr bryddes she seye, In a nest made of mossh &amp; cleye, And a-non she fel down sodenly Vp-on hyr knees &amp; þus gan crye: ‘O lorde almyhte, whiche hast ouere al Souerente, &amp; to euere creature, Fyssh, ful &amp; bestis, boþe more &amp; smal, Hast grauntyd be kyndly engenderrure To ioyen in þe lykenesse of ther nature, And in ther issu, iche aftyr his kynde, To worshyp of thy name wyth-owten ende! And I thank þe, lorde, þat þu to me Hast don as it is to thy pleasaunce, F[ro] þe yefte of thy benygnyte Me excludynge, swych is my chaunce. ?et if yt þe had lykede me to avaunce Wyth sone or dowgter, in humble wyse I wolde it han offrede to thy seruyse.’ And whan she thus had hyr entent Expressed wyth a ful mornynge chere, So-deynly, or she wyst what yt mente, An aungel be-forne hyr gan a-pere, Clad in lyht than þe sunne more clere, And wyth debonayr chere &amp; gret reuerence To hyr he shewyd thus his sentence: ‘Be not aferde, anne, thow vnwarly I thus appere in thy presence; For from heuen down sent am I, Of glad tydynges the to encence: How þe fruht of þi body in reuerence &amp; honour schal be &amp; in mennys mende Thorgh alle kynreddes to þe werdys ende.’ Whan þe aungel þus his ambacyat Had brefly doon, he vanysshed a-vay, And she astoyned &amp; so dysconsolat Was þat she nyst what she myght seye. And to hyr chaumbur a-non she toke þe way, Wher wyth-owt bodyly confort or chere A day &amp; a ny?t she lay in hyr prayer. And aftyr what tyme she dyd up ryse, Alle by-wept from hyr prayer, She clepyd hir mayde, to whom þis wyse She seyde: ‘syth þu sey me here So longe lyenge wyth-owt confort or chere Of ony wyht, how mayst þe [q]uyte That lyst not onys me to vysyhte? Allas, lorde, yf it schuld be seyde Al mannys confort þu hast from me Wythdrawen, &amp; also of myn handmayde, Which awt, me thynkyth, my confort han be! But al þis þu dost þat only in the I schuld trust, lorde, &amp; syngulerly Al my hope puttyn in thy mercy.’ To whom þis damysel grucchyng can sey: ‘Thow god thy wombe wyth bareynesse Hath shet, &amp; thyn husbonde takyn a-way, Wenyst þu these myscheus I myht redresse? Nay, nay!’ than anne for veray heuynesse Of þis answere fel sotheynly down, &amp; wepte wythowten consolacyon. In þis mene tyme an aungel shene In lykenesse of a ful fayre yunglynge To ioachym apperyd in [þ]e mountes grene, As he was a-monge his schepe walkynge; And to hym he wsyde þis talkynge: ‘What is [þ]e cause, telle it me pleyn, Why þu gost not hom to thy wyf ageyn?’ ‘?ung man,’ quod ioachym, ‘I wyl trewly Telle þe now euen lyk as yt is. I loue my wyf as affectually, I dar wel seyn, as any man doþe his; But þis twenty wyntur whiche be-forn þis We to-gedur han ben, or more I trow, The seed is lost which I haue sowe. I wante þe argumentes of a man; &amp; whan men be reknyd I am lefth behynde; For no maner isseu may I han, Neythyr son ne dowghter lyke me in kynde. &amp; syth in my felde no fruht may fynde, To telyn it lengur it were but veyne, As me thynkyth, þis certayne.

And also whan I thynk on þe vylany Whiche I hadde whan þe byscho[p] me hye Bad owt of þe temple, &amp; myn offrynge Despysed, cause I haue of mornynge. These thyngys peysed &amp; oþer moo Thus auysede, what euere be-tyde Hom ageyn I wyl neuer more go, But here wyth myn herdys I wyl abyde, &amp; wyth good avyhs I wyl prouyde To sende þe part whiche longeþe hem to Both temple &amp; wyf &amp; pore men also.’ &amp; whan he thus declaryde had his menynge, This yunglyng answerde ful demuerely: ‘I am an aungel of þe heuenly kynge, Which han apperyde þis day sothly To anne thy wyf, wepynge contenuely, &amp; now am y sent to declaren þe How youre prayers &amp; almes of god herd be.

Than Ioachym fel down sodenly Grouelynges &amp; abasshed ful sore, &amp; so from sext tyl nyht, sothely, On þe yorth he lay ase he dede were; &amp; than hys herdys had purposyde hym b[e]re To his graue, wenynge he dede had ben, &amp; þan to hymselfe he cam ayeyn. And whan he þus ageyn com was &amp; wel adawed of his swouwnynge, He tolde his seruantys al[þ]e cas &amp; what was cause of his fallynge, &amp; a-non þei hym conseled for any þynge al þat þe aungel dyde to hym seye Wythowt taryeng he it shulde obeye. Aftyr this, as Ioachym gan thynk In his hert what best was to do, Slepe aftyr heuynesse made hem to wynke, &amp; anon þis aungel, euene ryht so As he had vakynge, appered hem to Whyl þat he slepte, &amp; on þis wyse His massage to hym þus he dede deuyse: ‘I am þe aungel þe whiche at assignement Of god am comaundyde thy kepere to be; &amp; of my comynge, lo, þis þe entent, In hasty wyse þat þu home hye the. ?oure prayeris ben harde, &amp; ther-fore ye Swich a chylde shul haue as neuer to-fore, Ne neuer schal aftur, of woman be bore.’ And whan Ioachym of his slepe a-woke, He made hym redy wythowt lettynge, &amp; þankyd god, &amp; aftur that he toke Homward his weye, wyth hym ledynge Bothe herdemen &amp; bestys, forþe softe goynge; &amp; euer be þe wey as þey dyde walke, Of goddes goodnesse þey dede speke &amp; talke. And whan þey had ful ner spent Thryes ten dayes in here journey, An aungel from heuen to anne was sent, Whiche bad hyr goon to þe hy cyte Of ierusalem, wher she shulde ce At þe gate whiche hath name of golde Hyr spouse, the ioye of hyr h[o]us[h]o[l]de. Owt of hyr prayers a-non dede ryse Thys blessyde anne, &amp; on hyr veye To Ierusalem-warde, as dede deuyse The auungel, she gan hyr fast conueye; &amp; whan at þe goldede gates she sey Hyr dere spouse comyn wyth his herdemen, As fast as she myhte she gan to ren. She toke heed of non oþer thynge But of hym alone, for in veraay blysse Here þowte she was for his comynge. &amp; a-non she gan hym halsen &amp; kysse, No ioye wenynge þat she myht mysse Syth she hym hadde, &amp; þus she gan crye: ‘Welkecome, dere spouse, &amp; god gramercy! I was a wedowe, now I am non. I was also bareyn and repreuable, But nowe bareynesse is from me gon, And to conceyuyn I am made able Be goddes prouidence eterne &amp; stable; &amp; for his goodenesse shewyd vnto me Magnyfyed mot euere his name be.’ Whan þis miracle a-bowte was blowe Be þe trompet of fame in þat cuntre, To alle þo þat hem dede loue or know Ful gret ioy was of þat nouelte, And specyaly to alle ther offynyte. &amp; after þis hom þey went, sothly, The promysse abydynge of god mekely. After þe nyhnte monyth, as I remembre, Whan phebus in virgine had his curs ny runne, I mene þe eyghte day of september, To þe werd appered a newe sunne, &amp; of annes wombe sprange [þ]e oyle-tunne Of gracyous helthe to all þat beth seke, Wyth a deuouht hert if þey wyl it seke; This is to seyne, þat þis day was born þe glorious gemme of virginyte, Syche as neuer non was beforn, Nor neuer aftyr oþer lyke it shal be; Whos singuler priuylege was þis, þat she Shulde mayde be &amp; modyr eke of myssye; &amp; hyr name þey dede clepe marye. This lady to preysen as it were skyl Aftyr [þ]e meryte of hyr worthynesse, Fer pasyth my wyt thow not my wylle; I pleynley knowleche myn owne rudnesse. But who-so wyl knowen, as I do gesse, In englyssh here laudes, lat hem looke Of owre ladyes lyf Ihon lytgates booke. And who in latyn haue luste to know þis ladyes praysynge retorycally Expressed, ten bookes on a row He muste seke, entytlyd sothly ‘Of þe weddynge dytees,’ metryd coryously. In which tow werkys he shal inow fynde al þat of me is now lefth behynde. Aftyr þis, whan phebus (whiche euery day Chau[n]gith his herberwe, no-wher stabylly Vsyd to a-byden, for he meuyþ alway) The xii signes thryes by &amp; by In þe zodyak cercle had passyde coursly, &amp; in [þ]e ende of virgo taken his hostayge, Than was blessyd mary ful thre ?er of age. And Ioachym dysposed hym, &amp; his wyf Anne, deuowthly her vow to fulfille, To offren hyr dowgthter to þe lorde of lyf, In þe temple þer to dwelle stylle As long as it plessyd his blessyd wylle; &amp; to ierusalem for þe same entent At þe next feste both two they went. To-forn þe entre of þe temple than Were xv grees of marbyl grey &amp; brounn, As olde scriptures wel declare can, Be whiche to þe temple was þe ascencyon, &amp; at þe netherest was maria set down, &amp; she anon ryht vp ouyr on alle dede pace Wyth-owt ony help saf only of grace. A wondurful þyng it was to see that of alle þe while of hyr passage, Whil she stey vp from gre to gree, Not-wyth-stondynge hyr tendyrnesse of age, She neuer of-bak turnyde hyr vysayge, Nor after fadyr or modyr onys dyde calle, Tyl she had clomben vp þe grees alle. Ryht vp also &amp; nothynge stoupynge Al þe tyme she we[n]t, &amp; euere hyr eye On þe temple she was lyftynge, &amp; neuer hyr syht kest oþer weye. &amp; whan anne hyr modyr þis marvel seye, Fulfyllyde wyth þe holygostes grace, þus gan to seyn in þat same place: ‘Owre lorde god, most of puysshaunce, Past alle oþer, euere blessyde mot be, Of his holy worde wich haþe remembraunce, &amp; of his hy grace hathe vysedetyd me That I no lengere repreuyd shal be, Whil þat I lyue, of bareynnesse, Euer worshype to hym for his goodenesse! And not only from shameful bareynesse I am delyuerde þus singuler[l]y, But eke hys peple which was in dystresse He hathe vysyted so marcyfully, þat thoroghe my fruht, lord, gramercy, Not I alone but al mankynde Shal comforth fynde wyth-owten ende.’ Aftyr þis wyth an holy entente Ioachym &amp; anne bothe two in fere In þe temple dede vp presente Mayde marye, wyth ful humble chere, Preynge to god wyth herte entere þat he vouchesaf of hys mercy Here present to acceptyn benyngly. whan þis was doun they lefte hyr þer, Ioachym &amp; anne, &amp; hom ageyn To nazareth went, wher they dwelle[d] er, &amp; holyly lyuedyn, þis certayn. But how longe aftur I can not seyn Ioachym lyued, but wyl know I Anne had thre dowghters &amp; iche hyht mary; But wheþer be oon husbonde or ellys be thre, At þis tyme I wil not determyne, For in þis mater what best plesyth me I haue as I can declaryd in latyn In balaade-ryme, wherfore here to fyne Seynt annes lyf I fully me conuerte, þus hyr besechynge wyth ful louly herte: ‘O grasyous anne, wich hast worthyly of grace þe name, outh of whom dede sprynge She that of grace most meruelously &amp; of lyf eterne þe welle dede forth brynge In-to þis worlde, graunt at my partynge Be þe fatal cours from þis mutabilyte, Me in blysse eterne stablisshed to be.

Wowerys there come ful many oonn, Desyryng to haue hyr in maryage, But hyre fadyr heme avoydyd euerychone, Alleggyng the tendyrnes off hire age. And more-ouyr he seyde that hire curage, As he wele kneu, was goddys to serue, From whos seruyce she nolde outrage For no man thow she shuld sterue.

Haue on þi-self, we besech, mercy Fyrst &amp; formest, &amp; aftyr on us, And suffre not for a lytil foly Both us &amp; þe to perysshe þus.’ Whan þese maydyns on þis manere Had made here compleynt þus petously Wepyng, Cristyne wyth a sad chere To hem answeryd thus benyngly: ‘Why sey ye þus, maydyns? wold ye þat I Schuld to þese ydols for socour craue, Wych as I wel know sensibylly Mow me nere other hurt nere saue? Not so, damysels, but þis hold I best, Hym to worschip &amp; seruyn wych wyl &amp; may Both body &amp; soul makyn to rest Here and in joye þat lestyth ay, Wher neuer is nyht but euyr day A thousend-fowld bryhter þan ony is here. Hym wyl I worchip, þis no nay, Euyr whyl I lyue wyth hert entere.’ And whyl þei were thus in here talkyng, Hyr fadir cam jn to behold &amp; se Iff his doughtir made deuly hir offryng To his goddys as comaundyd had he. But sche to hym attende wold in no degre, But, opnyng hir wyndoo, wyth a wepyng eye Upward to heuyne deuouthly lokyd sche, And god in hyr herte dyde worchyp &amp; preye. And whan urbane off Cristyne sey þis chere, He clepyd hir to hym in goodly [w]yse And seyde, ‘dere doughtyr, why commyst no nere On-to my goddis &amp; doost hem sacrifyse, Lych as thou off me hast lernyd þe guyse From thyk tym þat þou fyrst was bore? Wher-fore, come furth, as I the deuyse, And doo now as þou hast doon here before. Knowyst þou not wele wyth what labowr And wepynge, doughtyr, &amp; what heuynes, Wyth how grett reuerence &amp; eke honour I the purchascyd off my goddis goodnes? Ne hap thanne that for þine vnkyndenes They in þere wreth on the tak wreche, Come furth anoon, and wyth all lowlynes Do to hem sacrifyce, I the beseche.’ Thys blessyd Cristyne, enspyryd wyth grace, Thus seyde to hir fadyr ful demurely: ‘Thynkyst thou, juge, that I trespace For I worchyp god in heuyn on hy?’ ‘Nay, doughtyr,’ quod he, ‘but þis I holde foly, That þou in þyne herte doost suppryse And tendryst oo god so affecteuously That for hym all oþir þou doste dyspise.’ ‘Heldyst þou my seruyse þan veyn &amp; lost— Sey treuth, I þe beseche—’ quod sche, ‘Wych fadyr, sone &amp; holy goost I do worshyp?’ ‘nay, but þan,’ quod he, Syth not oonly oon þou worchepst, but thre, As þou doost knoulechyn here oopynly, Why wylt þou not in lych degre Othyr goddys wyth hem seruyn comounly?’ ‘Now perseue I ryght well,’ quod Cristyne, ‘That þou wantyst wyt and vndyrstondynng, And lakkyst the influence of grace diuyne To knou þe hye mysterie off þis þynge, How thre personys haue but oo beynge In substance, &amp; woldyst so craftyly To þat fals conclusioun me bryng That mo goddys þan oon wurshyp schuld I. Itt wyl not bene. I knou þi wylle And hou besy þou art to disceuyn me; But yet schalt þou not me so begylle Vndir þe nounbir off a ternyte. Laboure no more, for it schal not be; For but oon god neuyr wurshyp schal I. And yet I knouleche þat þere ern personys þre, So distynct þat noon is oþir treuly. Hym wyl I loue, hym wyl I serue, Wyth uery &amp; hertyly subieccioune, Wych from all euyl may me preserue, And in ych nede be my proteccyoune, And not thy goddys wych neyþir moune Heryn ne seyn nere vndirstond, Ner from here plase meuyn up nore down Wyth-owtyn help off mannys hand. Wherfore me ordeyne neu frankensence, Wyche wyth all clennes off hert I may Offryn up to his souereyn reuerence Wyche regnyth in heuyn &amp; hath doon ay. Also ordeyn me neu &amp; clene aray, In wych, despoylyd off myne olde clothyng, I may hym off foryeuenes pray Off þo defautys wych I dyd ying.’ And anoon hir fadir aftyr hir entent, As hastily as he it coude deuyse, Ordeynyd hir a neu garnement And neu encens ek for sacrifyse. And when it come was, she hir dede disguyse And went up to hir wyndo aboue, And made hir offryng in ful humbyl wyse, Thus seyng to hir lord, hir loue: ‘O lord, wych duellyst in heuyn aboue, O saueour, wych of þi fadyr were sent On-to þis world for mannys loue And suffriddyst for hym ful hard iugement; O blyssyd ihesu, accept the entent Off þyne handmayde &amp; me strong make þat I neuer, for swych torment As me is ordeynyd, doo þe forsake,’ When she þus hade preyid, beforn hir face Anne aungel stode both bryght and clere, And seyde: ‘o Cristyn, fulfillyd wyth grace, Our lorde hath herde þi preyere. Be stronge in hym &amp; make good chere, For of thre jugis þou examynyd schal be; But god the forsak wyl in no manere, That hys uertu may glorifyde bene in the.’ ‘Now, lord god,’ quod Cristyn, ‘myn helpere be, That no man off me haue the victory.’ ‘Thy desyr is grauntyd, Cristyn,’ quod he; And wyth þat a loof she perceyuyd hir by, As whyte as snou and þan hony Swettere, wych whan sche dede take And had yt tastyd ful deuouthly, To god þus thankyng she dyde make: ‘Gramercy, lord, ful off goodnesse, Wych me a loof of immortalite Hast sent in tokyn off foryifnesse Off my synnys þrough þi pyte. Gramercy, lord, off thy cheryte Wych hast me kept þat I am not deed; For through my fadrys greth cruelte These dayis tuelue er sau I no brede.’ And at euyn hyre fadrys goddys ychoon Off gold &amp; siluyr, stondyng by a wall, Cristyn brak on pecys many oon, And by a wyndou lete hem down fall In-to þe strete, &amp; pore men dyde call, And made off hem a distrybucioun To all þat come both grete &amp; small, Not dredyng hyr fadrys persecucioun. The next morou whan vrban anoon Came up his doughtyr for to se, And fond hys goddys disperbyld &amp; goon, In his yrous passion, ful off cruelte, Hys doughtrys maydyns to hym clepyd he, And þus to hem seyde ful sturdely: ‘Where ern—in hasty wyse tellyth me— My glorious goddys and vndedely?’ At þis worde þeis madyns fel doun, So afferde þei were off his cruel chere, And seyde, ‘syre, þou haste of us dominacioun And mayst doon wyth us what þou wylt here; We may þe not fleen in no maner: Wherfore pleynly we wyl þou knou, That at þis wyndou þi douchtyre dere Thy golden goddys dyde all out throu.’ Whan urban þese maydens wordis dyde here, Hys doughtir he smote ful bustously Up-on þe cheke, &amp; seyde on þis manere: ‘Tell me wher be my goddys redyly, Ere I the asayle wyth more tormentry.’ ‘If þei be goddys let hem spekyn,’ quod she, ‘For hem-self here all opynly, And so prouyn here godly dignite.’ As sche þus had seyde, in here presence He sentencid þe maydyns heuedid to be; And anoon executyd was hys sentence. Quod Cristyne, ‘o tyraunth wyth-out pyte, Why sleest these innocentis in þis degre Wyth-out cause? I þe warn suthly Thys blode shal worthely dampne þe, And godis ueniance shal þe folwyn hastyly.’ Whan vrban þis herd, ful furyously Wyth yerdis hyr comaundyd bete to be. And anone she chorgyd was so cruelly That uerrey pete it was to behold &amp; se. Yet wer hir turmentours wers greuyd than she, For so wery þei were þat þai doun dyde fal. Urban þis seyng nere wode was he, And thretyd hem &amp; cowardis them dyde cal. But whyl blyssyd Cristyn þus tormentyd was, She chaungid neythir hir colour ne hir chere, For fulfyllyd she was wyth heuynly solace; And to hyr fadir sche seyd on þis manere: ‘O thou hateful to god &amp; man in fere, What may þi peynys &amp; þi thretis doo? Seest thou not þi seruandis ouyrcomyn here, And thy fadir þe deuyl &amp; þine own wyt also?’ Than comayndyd þis urbane wyth-out let Off strong yryn a colere ful vnpeteusly About hir nek fast to be schet, And aboutyn handis &amp; feet chenys myghty, And so in presone to be put ful cruelly. Wych doon, he home went on-to his plas, And fel down platlyngys, sorwyng heuely That of her doughtyr he so despisyd was. Whan cristynys modir pleynly had herd Hou sche of hir fadyr swych tormentry Had suffryd, as a wood womman she ferd, Renttynge hir clothis euene by &amp; by, And asshes sche strowed on hir heed on hye, And to the presoun þus arayd she went, Wher, fallyng doun &amp; wepyng petously, To hir doghtyr she expressyd þus hyr entent: ‘O doughtir Cristyn, haue mercy on me Thi wrechid modyr, for þe al oonly I haue and no mo, wych awtyst to be The lyght of myn eyn: thynk, dowghtir, þat I Ten monethis þe bare in my body, And wyth grete peyn in-to þis world þe brought. Is þis wurship, doughtyr, þus syngulerly To wurshipyn a god at we knou noght?’ But she whom grace dede illumyne To hir modir þus ansuerd anone ageyn: ‘Is þere ony of þi kyn clepyd Cristyne?’ ‘Noon þat I knou,’ quod hyr modyr, ‘certeyn’. ‘But þou þan trauaylist’, quod she, ‘in veyn, To clepe me doughtyr, &amp; lesyst þi labour; For þis I wyl þou know in wurdys pleyn My name I haue of cryst my creatour. He is my fadir, he is modir also, Wych me hath clepyd to heuenly cheualrye. Hym wol I seruyn, hym wyl I wurshyp do, Wych me assuryd hath to haue victorye Off al þo þat, blyndyd by ydolatrye, Not worchipyn þe god þat omnypotent is, And al þo maunmettys fully to diffye, In whos seruyse ye you excercysyn a-mys. Wherefore go hens, &amp; labour nomore. Clepe me not doughtyr; here I þe forsake.’ And she home went wyth-outyn more, And all þis processe told to hir make. And he for angyr gan tremelyn &amp; quake, And be his goddys swore þat þe next day Yf he leuyd he veniauns shuld take Off his doughtrys wordys wythout delay. The next morwe he Cristyne dede brynge To þe pretorye opynly, &amp; whan wommen seye Thus cruelly tretyd þis feyre mayde yinge, Among hem was meny a wepyng eye, And wyth a grete woys þai þus dyde preye: ‘O god of þis mayde, hir help, preye we, And þus shamefully ne suffre hir for to deye, Wych in tendyr age doth to þe fle.’ Whan urban hir sey, syttyng in hys see, ‘Cristyne,’ quod he, ‘what is þe cause why Aftyr þe custum vsyd in þis cuntre To oure goddys þou sacrifysyst not reuerently, Wych mow þe help in þis errour treuly Where-in þrogh reklesheed þou arte falle? And yf þou nylt, I shal wyth torment[r]y The assaylyn, &amp; neuer more doughtir calle.’ ‘I-wys, cruel tyraunth,’ quod þan cristyne, ‘Thou doost me greth grace yf þou wylt so, Neuere aftyr to clepe me doughtir þine. I not hou for me þou myght more do.’ And aftyr þat worde he hir commaundyd, lo, On a iebet to bene hange euene þere present; And þe tormentours anone hir come to, And wyth instrumentis of yryn hir sydys þei rent. Whyl þese tormentours so cruelly dyde schrape Cristynys sydis &amp; hir flesh dyde race, A gobet þer-of, as she had lyst to iape, Sche threu, þus seying, in-to hir fadir face: ‘O ould shreu of yll dayis þat pace, Syth þou desyryst flessh for to eet, Seke no forthere nere in noon oþer place. Haue of þine own &amp; faste gyne to frete.’ And whan vrban, off paciens hauyng no deel, The wurdys herd, he his doughtyr dere, From þe iebet doun takyn, on ane yrnene whele To be set hir bad, &amp; to make vndir grete fere; And þat no pyte in hym shuld apere, Oyle castyn þere-in he bad cruelly. In wych tyme to heuenward hir chere She lyft up, &amp; preyid þus deuoutly: ‘O god in heuyn wych hast þi duellyng-place, Fadyr of cryst ihesu wych euer blyssyd be, Thyn handmaydyn here, of þi special grace, And in þis grete conflyct, for-sake not me. Sheu on þis fere þi myht &amp; þi pouste, Wych here is ordeynyd to my torment, That þei mow knowyn wych know not the That þou al-one art lord omnipotent.’ And whan Cristyne had on þis manere Endyd hir preyere &amp; it fully do, Sodeynly sprang abouten þe fere And brent a thousand &amp; fyue hundred also Off hem wych sacrifyse þe ydols dyde to. And anone vrban to hem dyde calle Cristyn, and seyd, ‘tel me fast who Thys wychecraft þe tawht—foul hym be-falle!’ These wordys cristyne ansuerd þus to: ‘O cruel tyraunth, ful of vnpyte, What nede is to aske þe demaund who Thys wychecraft me taucht, syth I told þe That cryst my fadir is, and noon but he, Wych paciens me yiuyth to suffre mown. He is lycht of þe blynde þat mow not se, And ioy of hem þat suffren tribulacyoun. He is my mastyr, &amp; he aloonly tawt me The dreed of hym &amp; eek al ryghtfulnes. So perfyte a maystir is nowhere as he, Thorch whose doctryne al þi frowardnes I haue ouyrcomyn, &amp; al þi cruelnes Off swych tormentis as þou canst deuyse. Wher-fore þi pouer both more &amp; les Wyth sathanas þi fadir I despise.’ Wyth þese wurdis, vrban, sore agreuyd And trowblyd in hym-selph tempesteuously, Thynkynge heuy þus to be repreuyd, He þought what wyse he mycht vterly Hyr lesyn; &amp; shettyn he hir dyde hastly In a therk presoun wythout solace, In-to wych she entryd ryht gladly, Syngyng &amp; thankyng god in þat place. And as sone as Cristyn þus entryd was In-to þat horribyl &amp; lothful lake, Þre aungellis aperyd befor hir faas, Bryngyng hir brede als whyt as lake, Wyth oþir mete, and anone dyde take Hir woundis cure; &amp; she, up lokynge To heuenward, began hir preyere make Wyth deuout corage, þis wyse seyinge: ‘O lord ihesu cryst, thankyt þou be, Wych off þi grace &amp; off þi goodnes Vouchyddyst-saf not to forgettyn me Þine handmayde in my distres, But hast me sent of þi gentilnes, Be þine holy aungellis heuynly mete, Such as ryht well I dar expres In all erth shuld men noon gete.’ And þat self nyht þis cursyd man Fiue seriauntys on-to þe preson bad goon— I mene þe vnpetous &amp; cruel vrban— And bynd he hem bad ane heuy stoon To cristynys nek, &amp; furthwyth anoone Hir caryin &amp; castyn in-to þe see. And as he comaundyd þai went ychone And performyd hys cursyd &amp; cruel decre. And whan in þe see þai had throwe Cristyn, þus boundyn to a stone heuy, These men home fast ageyn dyde rowe; And anoon of aungelis a grete cumpany Dyde hir uplyfte, wyth whom on hye On þe watir she went, on no manere Hurt nere appeyryd; &amp; þan hertly To god she made þus hir preyere: ‘O lord, wyth moyses þi seruanth entere Wych wentyst, &amp; pharoo, þad dede pursu Thi peple, drynklyddyst in þe salt mere, And guyddydyst petir when þe tempest greu, Thyn handmayde now saue be þe same uertu, And þe lauatorye me graunt of immortalite Here in þis watir, o blyssyd lord ihesu, And wyth þe lycht of grace illumyne now me.’ And whyl blyssyd Crystyne þus dede preye, Goddys maieste to hir she seye commynge, And on his heed set a goldene crowne she seye; Off purpyl pure a stolle was his clothynge; And wyth odoure of rychels ful suete smellyng, Beforn hym passyd aungels many oon, And wyth ympnys &amp; psalmys wel tonyng, Thousandis of aungellis aftyr hym dyd goon. And when Cristyn þis gloryus syht dede se, Doun plat she fel up-on þe watyr clere, For wyth grete feer astoynyd was she. And anone þe good lord, cumynge hir nere, Hyr up lyft, and seyd, ‘be of good chere, Cristyn, dere doughtir! I am þi sauyour Whom þou louyst &amp; seruyst wyth hert entere. I come to delyuyr þe fro ydols errour. I am ihesu, lord of þe heuynly ost, Lycht, graunter of grace to þem, in humbyl wyse That my fadir &amp; me clepyn in þe holy gost, And al fals maumettys hertly despyse.’ And wyth þat wurd he hir dyde baptyse Wyth his own handys in þe salt see, And from þe water whan she dyde upryse, In þe myddys he hir set of þe cyte. And þan Cristyn, knelyng on eþir kne, Thankyd enterly god of his grace; And vpward wyth þat hir eyne lyft she, And sey heuyn opyn &amp; ihesu in pas; And þar-wyth she fel doun on hir face, Deu reuerence doynge to cryst, god almycht. And aftyr she entryd in-to hir fadir place, In preyer contunyng tyl it greu day-lycht. And whan þe day sprongyn &amp; fled was þe nyt, And urban in his pretorye Cristyn fond preyng, He gretly ameruel was off þat syht, And thretyd hys seruauntys þat þei had wenyng Hym illudyd; and wythout lettyng To presoun he hir chargit anoon to be sent. On þe next day, euyn in þe mornyng, He comaundyd beforn hym hire to be present. ‘Cristyne,’ quod he than, ‘what enchauntement Vsyst þou, þat drynklyn may þe not þe see?’ ‘Marryd in þi resoun &amp; in þi wyttys blent, Wyth-owtyn vndirstondyng thou art,’ quod sche, ‘And ellys well knowen þou shuldyst þat me This nyht my god ihesu dyde baptise; Wherfore þi fadir þe deuyl and eke þe Wyth all þi fals goddys I dredles despise.’ These wordis vrban so sore dyde agryse, Þat anoon to presoun he hir sent ageyn, Purposyng þe next day in moost cruel wyse Wythout more deley hir to slee, certane. What doyst þou, vrban? þou labouryst in vayne, For victory of to mo she must haue wyth þe, As to hir be reuelacioun told was ful pleyn. For wych conclusioun she preyid in þis degre: ‘O lord ihesu cryst, wych doun to me Þis nyht from heuyn com for my solace, &amp; me dedyst baptyse in þe salt see Wyth þine own handys, of þi specyal grace, Behold hou þine handmayde vrban doth manace To-morwe to sleyn þrogh his cruel wreche; Lord, aftyr his meritys lat hym hens pace, And frustrat hym of his wyl, I þe beseche.’ Thys preyer endyd, as doth þe story teche, Entryng þe presoun, she god dyde magnifye. And þat same nyht fel[l] on hym þe wre[c]he Þat she preyid for; wyth swych tormentrye Þe deuyl hym vexyd þat he loude gan crye, For al his entraylys for uere peyn dyde swelle; And in þe same oure he orrebylly dyde dye, And aftir hys desert went to þe deuyl of helle. And whan men to cristyne þis þing dide telle, Sche knelyd, deuoutly þus made hir prayere: ‘Lord god, gremercy, of al goodnes þe welle, Þat þou on vrban hase shewyd þi pouere, Wych from þi promyssys was foreyn &amp; strengere. The semyth, lord, honoure &amp; preysyng of al men, Wych wyth þi oonly sone &amp; þe holy gost in fere Lyuyst and regnyst, oo god, now &amp; euyr, Amen.’ Not long aftyr, whan þe rhy[t]uyhsnesse 2 pars. incipit Of god on vrban had þus ueniaunce take, And Cristyne delyueryd out of dystresse, A new prefect þe emprour dyd make, Wych grete lust had for to doon wrake On cristene men in euere plase Wher he coude eny cache or take; And zyon þis prefectys name was. And anoon was hit presentyd hym al þe case Of cristyne, be þe offycers of þe cyte; And whan he it red, wyth a pale fase, He astoynyd was of þat nouelte. And anoon he askyd where she myht be, And þei ful redyly hym dyde telle That neþir hyd nere fled was she, But in þat cyte she styl dyde dwelle. And moreouyr þus in his herte He thowte: ‘to here goddys to sacrifyse Syth turmentis hir ne myht conuerte, How shul I do, &amp; in what wyse Shal I hir moun feryn &amp; agryse, To my conclusyoun þat she asent?’ And anoone, be uertu of hys offyse, He chargyd men furth hir to present. And whan she brouht was hym beforn, Þus wyth feyr speche he hir gan asayle, And sayd, ‘o damysel, worthily born, And to oft, me semyth, distressyd in gayle, I wold wet what it may þe auayle To forsakyn þe goddys wych leuyn ay And of her godhed makyn a mayle, And worchipyn oon þat þe help ne may.

Thy broþir vrban me ne myht constreyn These ydols to worship ne to serue. Tak þis for ansuer in wordys pleyn: Nere þou ne shalt, thowe thou doo me sterue.’ Zyon, aggreuyd wyth þis ansuere, A vessel of bras, ful hoot brennyng, Full of py[c]he, rosen, oyle &amp; smere, Wythout let he þeddyr dyde bryng, And bad kastyn þer-in þis maydyn ying, And assignyd four men wyth stauys myhty Off yryn þer-ynne hir to turn &amp; swyng, That she mycht dye þe more hastyly. Whan Cristyne sau þis vessel stondyng, To heuyn wyth terys she kest hir eye, And seyd, ‘o god, lord of al þing, Wyth lowly hert to þe I preye, To thre chyldryn wych [cuen]chyddyst the leye Off þe flaummyd furnes, be now present To þine handmayde, &amp; lat me not deye Wyth þis orrybyl &amp; cruel torment.’ And whan she þus had offryd hir hertys entent To god, or þe tormentours comyn hir nere, To þe seyd uessel she frely went, And leyd hir þere-in wyth a glad chere; And in no wyse hurt hir þe fyre; For wyth heuynly deu she enbamyd was, So as she had in a full fresh herbere Amoung flourys lyne &amp; amoung grene gras. ‘Cristyne,’ quod zyon, ‘as I now wel se, Thys feer hath þe touchyd yet no thyng.

And when he had so lyne a long space, He roos up &amp; seyd wyth grete wondryng: ‘Cristyne, þou hast doon gret trespace.

And forgyf us, lord, þis grete trespace That we to ydols haue tak swych hede. We were disseuyd for lak of doctryne, And so in ydolatrye owr errour was long, But now, þurgh help of þis blyssyd uirgyne, The trew beleue we doon vndir-foung, Wych for to kepe, lord, mak us strong, And neuere it to forsak, þowe we shuld dye, And wyth goostly ioy &amp; wyth heuynly soung Þyne holy name euere to gloryfye.’ And at þat tyme conuertyd were þere Thre thowsend peynyms be trew computacioun.

And whan to Cristyne was made relacioun, She þankyd god, seying þus deuoutly: ‘Gremercy, lord, wych art euyr redy To þeme þat trustyn in þi goodnes, Wych also shewyst oftyn how myhty Thou art here enmys to repres.’ And when she þat þankyng expres, Oon þat was þe iugys assessour To presoun hir sent of his cruelnes, Tyl a neu iuge come from þe emperour. And whan Cristyne was entryd þat lothly toure, She knelyd, seying þus: ‘o eternally Reynyng in blys, fadir, creatour, Wyth ihesu cryst þi sone begottyn oonly, Wyth whom þe holy goost eek egally Leuyth &amp; regnyth, yete ye al thre, In personys distynct substancially, Arn but oo god in trinite. Gramercy, lord, wych of þi benignite Voushyd-safe þi promys to acomplyse, Wych þow madyst, lord, onys to me By ane holy aungel in gracious wyse, My fadrys counsel when I dede despyse, That thre iugys shuld ful cruelly Wyth torment asseyn me to gryse; And off all þou me grauntyst þe victory.

Wher goddys rhytwysnes hym wold haue, From þe emperour anoon was sent A neu iuge to Tyre, clepyd Iulyane, A paynym eke &amp; a full cruel man, Whose joy &amp; lust was euyr newe, Aftyr þe wyl of hys fadyr sathan, Cryst &amp; Cristyne for to pursewe. Upon wych he was ful inguysytyf Of iugys actys wych was hym before, And anoon was presentyd hym þe lyfe Of blyssyd Cristyn &amp; of al hir loor, And how þoo to iugis haddyn it swor She ne myht be broght from hir entent. And anoon Iulyan, wythout moor, For hir to presoun hys offycers sent. And whan she was to hys presens brouht: ‘By þi wychecrafth many wundrys,’ quod he, ‘Thou hast doon; but yete dout it noht Thow shalt in no wyse ouercomyn me. Wherfor do sacryfyse I counsel þe To our immortale goddys, or I shal applye To þe [s]wych peynys wych feerful shuld be To þi ihesu, born of Ioseph &amp; Marye.’ ‘Held þi pees,’ ful loude Cristyn gan crye, ‘O tyraunth cruel wyth-out discrecioun, And lych a man fallyn in-to a frenysye! Þis iniurye no wyse myn eerys here moun, Þat þow, as a dogge wyth-out resoun Berkyng, blaspheme þat name hooly In whos honour euere kne boueth doun Off heuyn &amp; of erth &amp; of hel lothly.’ Whan Iulyan þis herd he wex angry, And in his angyr anoon comandyd he In ane ouene thre dayis contenuelly, Wych fersly brent, hire shet to be. But Cristyne, trustyng in þe trinyte, Wyth tokne of cros hir foor-heed merkyng, Entryd þe furneys, wher whan was she, God she dyde preyse deuouthly syngyng. And whan þe sowdeours wythoute stondyng Herdyn hir wyth-inne þus god magnyfye, To Iulyane þei runne, euyn þus seying: ‘We þe be-sech, syr, ful humbyllye, Wrath þe not wyth us, for whan we aspye Dyde Crystyn, in þe furnes whom shet had we, Gret god of heuene preysyn &amp; glorifye, Ful fast for feer we a-wey dyde fle.’ Iulyan, astoynyd of þis new case, Commaundyd þe ouen vndoon to be. Wher-inne Cristyn as shynyng was As is þe sunne in his degre; And anoon all harmles out cam she, Preseruyd be þe grace of goddys uertu, And wyth hympnys &amp; soungys ful of melodye She excellyd &amp; preysyd hir lord ihesu. And wyth þat Iulyan hir dyde commawnde To-forn his bench to be made present, And of hir he askys þis demaunde: ‘Why preuaylyst þou? &amp; be what enchauntement Is it at þou art not all to-brent? Sey me anoon, ere ellis pleynly Thy tendyr body shal bene al to-rent Wyth sundry peynys &amp; diuers tormentrye.’ Yet efthsonys quod Cristyn, ‘hold þi pees, O vnhappy tyraunth, voyd of al goodnes. To aske swych demaundys some tyme cees, Wych þou ne owyht to knou for þi cursydnes. But by þi þretys &amp; by þi malyciousnes I set noht, for as feythfully as I kan In ihesu I trust &amp; in his mercyfulnes, And drede not to me what doth ony man.’ Wyth þis answer wood was Iulyan, And clepyd to hym oon wych had cunnyng Serpentys to charm, and as he wold han Hys lordshepe hym chargyt wyth-out lettyng Two hornyd serpentys furth for to bryng, And two snakys wyth-al, &amp; when þei come were: ‘I trow,’ quod he, ‘þat al þine enchauntyng Shal not let þeis serpentys þe to dere.’ ‘Thow art euer alych new for to lere,’ Quod Crystyne, ‘o fonne, as in þis degre. Wenyst þou my god lyk þi goddys were Off ownpowere? nay, pleynly,’ quod she, ‘For he þat in al my tormentys hath be Myne helper, &amp; me neuer dyde forsake, May, and he wyl, now defendyn me, And of al þi serpentys me victrych make.’ And wyth þat woord, to doon hir wrake, Vp-on hir heed þe serpentys to He dyd do cast and eythyr snake, Wenyng þat þei hir harm shuld do; But als soon as þe serpentys comyn hir to, Thei claspyd hir helys ant þe dust dyde lykke Þer-fro, &amp; heng up-on hir pappys also Lyk smal infauntys wych kun no wykke. Thys sycht wyth sorou þe hert dyde prykke Of Iulyan, and anoon on-to þe incantatour: ‘Thy craft,’ he seyde, ‘is not worth a flykke! I trow þou art turnyd to þis wycchys errour.’ And wyth þat þe ma[n] dyde al hys labour To steryn hem wyth wordys of wycchecrafth To haue stung hir, but þat same our They hir left &amp; hym hys lyfe berafth. And whan þe pepyl wych þere present was Sey þe incantatour deed on þis manere, Þei were so afferd of þis veniabyl case Þat aftyr þat our for no mystere Durst oon of hem com Cristyne nere Ne touche neþir serpent nore snake. Crystyne, þis seying, to heuyn hir chere Kest up, &amp; þus hir preyer dyde make: ‘O lord god wych in heuen doost duelle, And sentyst þi sone our kynd to tan, And clepyddyst lazer a-geyn from helle, Her me þin handmayden wych as I kan The lowly beseche for þi dede man. Qwyk hym ageyne, lord, þrough þi mercy, That al men seying wych resoun han May thy name glorify now &amp; endlesly.’ And whan she þus had endide hir prayere, Þis voys from heuene cam doun opynly: ‘O blyssyd Cristyne, my doughtir dere, Trust in me, good doughtir stedefastly, And do furth as þou hast perseuerauntly. For þis I wyl to all men knowe be, Wyth þe I am in all þi warkys soothly, And what þou askyst is grauntyd to þe.’ And suddeynly þe erth made a roryng, And blyssyd Cristyne both sage &amp; whys Crowchyd þe body, þus loud crying: ‘In þe name of ihesu cryst, man, ryse!’ And anoon he roos, &amp; in ful humbyl wyse Be-forn Cristyne he fel, &amp; þus gan seyn: ‘Euere þankyng to þi god moost of pryse, Wych me fro deth to lyfe hath reysyd ageyn.’ Iulyan þis seying was sory certeyn, And to hir seyd wyth chere gyrnyng: ‘Now al þi wychecraftys syth þou here pleyn Hast shewyd, to owr goddys wythout lettyng Return ageyn, hem lowly þankyng That þei so long &amp; so benygnely Han þe suffryd,’ to wych talkyng Cristyne þus ansuerd ful redyly: ‘O witles man &amp; wyth-owtyn drede, treuly, Of god, &amp; eke wyth-out vndirstondyng, In þi soul blyndyd ful dolorusly, Sey not þine eyne here brode-lokyng My goddys werkys, þe heuenly kyng, And of hys blyssyd sone cryst ihesu, Wych he hath wroght, al men seyng, T[h]rough þe myght &amp; þe grace of his uertu?’ Aftyr þis Iulyan in his malycoly Commaundyd hir brystis of to kyt be, And anoon it was doon ful cruelly Wyth-owtyn eþir mercy or pyte. ‘O straungere from treuth, Iulyan,’ quod she, ‘Syth þou my pappys a-weye doost rase, In tokyn of clennes of uirginite, Lo, mylk for blood þere-out doth pase.’ And lokyng to heuene-ward she seyd þus: ‘Wyth al myne hert, lord, gramercy to þe, Kyng of al werdys, cryst ihesus, Þat þou vouchysd-safe euery lettyng from me Of my body awey kut for to be. Now knou I well, þrogh þi proteccyoun, That I redye am to end my mortalyte, And þe crown to take of incorrupcyoun.’ Whan she had endyd þus hir vrysoun, Iulyane wyth angyr &amp; malyncoly blent, Comaundyde wythoutyn ony delacyoun Eftsonys to presoun hir to be sent; Where she, knelyng wyth ane holy entent, Al þat nyht aftyr ful deuoutly Magnifyid our lord god omnipotent, Hys holy name blyssyng contynuelly. And on þe next morou he bad eerly Hir to be broght on-to his presence. And whan she com was, he hir askyd why She nold assentyn to her pryncys sentence. ‘Com furth,’ quod he, ‘&amp; now offre encence To our goddys, or ellys wyth-out deley I shal þe sleen; lat hym mak defence, Thy god whom þou seruyst, yf þat he may.’ ‘Knowst þou not, wreche,’ quod Cristyne, ‘Þat goddys pacience þe to penytence Abydyth lenger &amp; gladly wold inclyne? But þou þrough þi frowerd negligence Alwey mysvsyst his blyssyd pacience. Of cursyd custum plounchyd in þe myre, And makying of purpose wylful resystence Tresoryst þe veniaunce in-to þe day of yre.’ Iulyan, angryd wyth þat Cristine seyde, Commaundyd hir tong out kut to be; But Cristyne þus fyrst deuoutly preyde: ‘Lord ihesu cryst, wych from my natiuite Hast me kept &amp; neuer forsoke me, Kepe me now, &amp; þin handmayd here, And grant me my batayl to endyn in þe, For of my reste þe tyme drauyht nere.’ And anoon in þe eyr men dyde here A voys þus seying: ‘for þou hast for me Suffryd mych peyn, my doughtir dere, And euer bene pacient in al aduersite, Ther-foor þe gatys of heuyn to þe Bene now wyd opynnyd; come jn meryly, Ant rest in pese &amp; tranquillyte, And resseyue þe croun of blys endlesly!’ But not-wyth-stondyng þis voys heuenly, Iulyan bad hem doon his commaundement, And anoon hir tong þei rent out cruelly. And whyl sche was in þis torment, Of hir tong a pese wyth a mychty entent She spyt in his face, &amp; hys oon eye So sore it smet þat þe sycht was blent, And wyth þat to hym she þus dyde seye: ‘Iulyan, wrecche, þi desyre was vnkouth To etyn ane instrument of my body, Wherfor my tounge out of my mouth Thow hast do drawe dyspytuosly, Wych euyr was wone to preye besely Goddys hye name whyl þat it myht. Yet haue I spe[c]he, &amp; þou wurthyly Off þine oon eye hast lost þe sycht.’ Iulyan þis heryng his hunters dyde charge Cristyne to sleyn &amp; þat hastyly. And anoon on hir syde wyth wondys large They hir dide smyte ful vnpetously. Than Cristyn þus preyid: ‘þrough þi mercy, Lord, tak my spyrith on-to þi grace.’ And wyth þat word, out of hir body To heuyn blys hir soul dede pace, And anoon aungelys in þat same plase Gunne Iulyane tormentyn, in sundry degre, Wyth so grete peynys þat he cryed, ‘allase! What shal I doo now? se I wel,’ quod he, ‘That for Crystyne þis commyth to me, Whom I haue sleyn ful vnpetously.’ And whan he þus long tormentyd had be, He sterf &amp; went to endles torment[r]y. And whan Iulyane was þus passyd &amp; goon, Oon wych was of Cristyns kynrede, Þat heryng, þiddyr came anoon, Wych god dide bothyn loue &amp; drede; And for he hopyd to haue heuene to mede, In appolloos temple he made a memory, Whedyr Crystynys relikys he dyde lede And þere hem beryid ful solemmely. Examynyd was þis blyssyd Cristyne, The tyme of þe emperour dyoclecyan, Under thre iugys, lych as determyne The legend off hir ful wel can. Fyrst by hir own fadyr, clepyd vrban, Aftyr be zyon, a cruel tormentour, But last &amp; werst was þis Iulyan, Vndyr whom she endyd al hir labour. Thus fourtene yere was hir martyrdame Contunyd vnder þeis iugys thre, Wych wyth hir constaunce she ouyr-came, In Tyre, þat tyme a grete cyte, Where fynally also martyrd was she, As in hir lyfe who wyl redyn may, Þe nynt kalend of august, as fynd we, Wych þat tyme fel on a thursday.

Aftyr þe sentence of þe golden legend, A lytyl whyl hedir do he attende. Whylom þer was in thyk cuntre Wych þat is clepyd brytane þe lesse, A wurthi kyng &amp; Maurus hecht he, Or [N]othus, as þe story dooth expresse; And so mych moor was his wurthynesse Þat he on cryst oonly dide beleue, And al false goddys he dide repreue. Thys Maurus had a dought[ir] ying, Vrsula clepyd, ful of beute, Wych aftyr god passyd al þing Louyd cleennes &amp; maydynly honeste, Prudent eek &amp; also wyhs was she, Off wych þorch ych cuntre was hir name Ful wyde blow by þe trumpet of fame. Whan þe kyng of ynglond of hir dide here, Wych þat tym was man so fortunate And of swych pouer, þan to his empere Many a cuntre he had subiugate. Hym thought no þing moor myht his astate Encresyn, þan þat he onys myht se This blyssyd meyd hys sonnys wyf be. And not oonly þis was hys desyre, loo, But þe sone eek þe same dide entend; Vp-on wych þe maydyns fadyr too A ful solemne ambassyet þei dide send, And ne hap þat excusacioun he wold pretend, Aftyr feyr promessys they dide hym threte If þer massengers voyd þei dide home lete. Whan Maurus herd had al þer massage, He was gretly abasshyd of þat case. For his doughtir, [fayr] &amp; ying of age, Cristene, &amp; fulfyllyd wyth uertu &amp; grace, To a kyngys sone þat hethyn was, And lyuyd in þe wrechnes of ydolatre, To be maryd hym þouht vnwurthe. More-ouyr also he dide suppose That whan vrsula had uerrey knowlechyng Of þere entent &amp; of þer purpose She assentyn shuld wyln for no thyng. And bysydyn þis the englyssh kyng Ful sore he drede for our creuelnes, Wych to hym causyd grete heuynes. But whan vrsula conseyuyd þis matere Encytyd be ane heuenly inspyracyoun, ‘Fadyr,’ quod she, ‘be of ryht good chere, And grauntyth to hem here conclusyoun Wych they doon aske, up thys condicyoun, Þat þei effectuelly wyl obey Serteyn conclusyouns wych I shal seye.’ Fyrst, I aske þat þei shul to me Ten of þe choysest maydyns sende, And feyrest &amp; wurthyest of þere cuntre, And upon ych of us for to attende Of oþir maydyns assygne a thousende, And ordeynyn us shyppys, &amp; yerys thre Me respyten to halowe my uirginyte. In þis mene tyme I aske also Þat þe kyngys sone forsake ydolatrye, And my god of heuene be conuertyd to, And baptysyde in cristys name holy, And in my beleue be instruct pleynly. And al þeis doon, I hym ensure, To louyn hym abouyn ony creature. But al þis she axyd for þat entente Þat eþere for dyffyculte of þe condycyoun He shuld wyl secyn &amp; not concente, Or ellis þat she be þis occasyoun All þo maydyns wyn shuld moun To crystene feyth, &amp; be hem many mo. Thys ansuere yeuyn, þe massagers hom go. And whan þei had of þe seyde matere To þe kynge declaryde euyn al þe case, Hys son admyttyd wyth ryht glad chere All þe condyciouns enspyryde throgh grase. And anoon aftyr þis he crystnyd was, And preyid hys fadyr ful instantly To performe þe remnaunth, &amp; þat hastyly. Aftyr þis in moost hasty wyse To vrsula þei sent word ageyn That al þingys wych she dyde deuyse In haste performyd shulde bene certeyn; Wherefore, þat no labour shuld be ueyn, They hyr preyid þat she wold spede To the seyd halwyng of hir maydynhede. And anoon were gadryd, fram ych cuntre Of ynglond, maydyns to þis entent, The feyrest þat ony-where myht founnde be, And ouyr to Vrsula þei were sent. And whan fulfyllyd was þestent Plenerly of hir fyrst askyng, Thanne þei dyde cese of mo gadryng. In þis mene whyl, on þat oþir syde, The fadyr of vrsula ful dilygently Of swych a mene dede prouyde As was conuenyent for þat company, Hem to seruyn &amp; to guyde deuly, Aftyr þe entent of his doughtir dere, And at all tymys hir to confort &amp; chere. Whan pupplysshy[d] was þis neu myracle, So many uirgynys assemblyd for to be, Many a bysshape cam to þis spectacle; Among wych cam pantulus, of basyle Byshape, wych þat al þere iourne To rome &amp; ageyn hem dyde conueye, And at Coleyn homwarde wyt hem dyde deye. Seynt Serasine eek of Cecyle þe quene, Wych hir husbond, a cruel man fyrst, lo, Made aftyr of a wulf a lambe to bene, Martyryre þe bysshop wych sustyr was to, And to sarye, þe modyr of vrsula, also: Whan informyd she was of þis company, Them to vysyte she hire hyyd hastly, And wyth hir she toke in hyr cumpany Hyr four doughtrys, Babyle &amp; Julyane, Victoria &amp; Aurea, &amp; also sothly, Hyr yongest sone, clepyd Adryane Wych for hys sustrys sake þis iourney dyde tane; And, þe kyngdam left in here own sonnys hande, To brytane she seylyd &amp; to ynglonde. And whan seyd Seraphyne, ful of prudence, Wyth hir fiue chyldryn cam to þe plase Where vrsula was, she gret dyligence Dede both hir &amp; þe falashepe to solase And hem to conferme in her neu grace, And was here guyderesse to Rome &amp; geyne, And eke wyth hem deyid in colane. Thus whan al þing was redy Necessarye to þer holy iourne, And be doctryne off vrsula al þe cumpany To cryst was conuertyd, þei tuk þe se; And wyth jnne a tyde in good prosperyte To tyel, a port of fraunce, þei came, And from þens, to Coleyn þe weye þei name. And þere ane aungel dyde appere To vrsula, whyl she aslepe was, And bad her ben of ryht good chere For she return shuld þrogh graas Wyth hir hool nowmbyr to þat plase, And þer þe palm of uictory By martyrdam takyn &amp; of glory. ‘Where-fore,’ quod he, ‘kepyth your entent, And furth to Rome [y]ou fast doth hy.’ And at hys counsel from þens þei went On-to þe cyte by watyr of basylye, And þer þey left þer schyppys, sothlye, And from þens to Rome þei went on foot, Here soulys to purchas helth &amp; boot. To þe pope Ciriacus ful grete solace It was whan he kneu of whens þei were For he of Brytane also born was, And as by her puruyours he dyde lere, Ful many a kynnys-womman he had þere, And þerfor he dede al hys labour Them to receyue wyth grete honour. And þe same nyht from heuene lernyd he By reuelacyoun er þan he roos, That wyth þese uirgynys he martyrd shuld be And þankyd god hertyly of þat purpos, But þis reuelacyoun he kept cloos; And many of hem wych not yet were Crystined he baptysyd euyn þere. And whan a yere &amp; wokys elleuyn, Aftyr petyr þe nyntend pope, suthly, Had gouernd þe cherche of cryst in heuyn, He made a congregacioun of þe clergy, And shewyd hem his purpose euyn opynly, And aforn hem all þer renowncyd he All hys hy astate &amp; eke hys dignyte. But her ageyn þei al dide reclame, And cardynallys most in especyal, Wych of fonnyddrye hym dide blame, And þat he wold be so bestyal To forsakyn hys glorye pontifical, And aftyr a feu fonnyd wommen Wyth-outyn resoun þis wyse to ren. But nertheles fram his purpose He wold for no man remeuyd be, Wherfor a holy man, clepyd Ametos, In hys stede anoon þer ordeynyd he, Wych shuld occupyen þe papal se; And þis doon he fast dyd hym hye To þis blyssyd uirgynys cumpanye. And for he ageyn þe clergyis entent Forsuk þus þe papal dignyte, They ordeynyd hys name, wyth oon assent, From noumbyr of popys racyd to be. Also al þe fauour wych þis cumpane Of holy uirgynys had in þe court before, From þis tym furth was uttyrly lore. In þis mene tym, as þe story doth tel, Tuo pryncys of þe romayn cheuelrye, Maxym &amp; Affrycane, fers &amp; cruel, Wych þe reule had, &amp; of þer polycye, To þese blyssyd uirgynys had enuye, For-as-mych as þei seyn dayly Euermor encresyn her company. Thys was here feer, þat more &amp; more Eche day shuld growen &amp; encrese Crystyn relygyoun þrogh þer lore, And paynymry wansyn &amp; discrese, And al þer heþin rytys cese. Wherfor þei ymagyd by what suttelte They myht hem makyn dede for to be. And whan þei had espyed here entent Þat by coleyn homward þei wold pase, Pryuy massagers to her cosyn þei sent, Julyan, wych prynce of þe vryens was, Preying hym for þere aldrys solaas Þat al uirgynys, whan þei come þere, He wold sleen for þei cristyn were. But whan wyth þese uirgynys furth went Þis seyd holy pope, Ciriacus, A cardynal prest wyth deuout entent Hym dyde folwe, clepyd Innocencius, And oon of Britane born, callyd Iacobus, Wych seuen yere had in antyoche cyte Of bysshoprych gouernd þe dignyte. And as he had uisytyd þe pope at rome And homward returny[n]ge was certeyn, Swych a multitude of uirgynys to come Out of hys cuntre whan he herde seyn, He left hys iourney &amp; turnyd ageyn And ass[o]cyid hym on-to þer cumpanye, Purposyng wyth hem to lyuyn &amp; dye. This same dide oon clepyd Mauricius, Bysshop of a cyte callyd Leuyten, And also anoþir wych heht Sulpicius, Bysshop of þe gret cyte Rauen, Wych both wer holdyn ryht holy men; And in þe mene tym wern at Rome, And wyth þese uirgynys to Coleyn þei come. And Marculus, a bysshop of grece, also, Wyth Constance hys nyfte, doughter of kyng dorothe Of Constantynopyl—wych a kyngis sone to Shuld haue be weddyd, but deed was he Beforn þe maryage, &amp; she hir uirgynyte To god had auowyd—be heuynly reuelacyoun Where monestyde to come to þis congregacioun. And whan al þese uirgyns wyth bysshopys in fere From rome wyth vrsula returnyd ageyn, To ethereus, hir spouse, bad ane aungel clere His modyr to counselyn wyth wurdys pleyn To be Cristnyd; for hys fadyr, certeyn, Þe first [y]er þat he crystene was Hys soul had comendyd to goddys grace. And not oonly hys modyr to baptyse Kyng Ethree monestyd þis aungel suet, But also þat he in ful hasty wyse To coleyn shuld goon, þer for to mete Wyth ursula hys wyfe &amp; hyr to grete, Wher þei both to-gedyr &amp; meny mo By martyrdam to heuen blys shuld go. And anoon, to goddys counsel obeying, Hys modyr he made baptysyde to be, And took hyr and hys systyr ying, Florentyne be name, &amp; also tuke he A bysshep, clepyd Clement, and wyth hem thre To Coleyn ful fast he gan hym hye; And socyid hym to þat holy cumpanye. And whan at Coleyn to-gedyr met Ethereus &amp; vrsula, wyth þer cumpanye, They found þe cyte ouyr al beset Wyth vryens wych þat þere dyde lye In þese uirgyns to shewen here tyrannye, Lych as preyid had here prynce Iulyan Hys to cosyns, Maxym &amp; Affrican. And whane þeis paynyms dide aspye Thys blyssyd cumpany come nere hem to, All wyth oo voys þei loud dyde crye; As raueynows wuluys be wone to do Among a flok of sheep, ryht euyn so Ferd þese tyrauntys amoung þis cumpany Of holy uirgyns, &amp; slew hem by &amp; by. They sparyd not oon, neythir hye nor law, Man nore womman, but al in fere Wyth dynt of deth þei dyd doun throw, Þat pyte it was to seyin &amp; here How cruelly &amp; wyth what chere Al þis multytude þei dyd quelle, Saf vrsula alone, as þe story doth telle; Whos beute whan þe seyd Iulyan, Prynce of þe Vryens, dyde attende, ‘Be of good chere,’ quod he, ‘ womman, For yf þou wyl to me condescende From al dysesys I wyl þe defende, And moor-ouer þe weddyn wyth a ryng, And to welth &amp; wurshyp I wyl þe bryng.’ But she wold no wyse to hym assente, Wherfor in his grete malicoly A myhty bowe anoon he bente, And wyth a sharp arwe ful cruelly He hir smote euyn þrogh þe body, Wherwyth to erth it dide dounfal, But þe soul to ioy went eternal. Yet oo mayde þer was, aftyr þe legende, Cordula by name, wych þat nyht From þe dynt of deth hir to defende In a shyp hir hyd, wher no man myht Hyr fynd; but whanne þe next morowe lyht Was come, illumynyd by goddys grace, To martyrdam hir offryd, &amp; martyrd was. But for-as-mych as þis blyssyd uirgyne Wyth þe remnaunt of þat cumpany Of martyrdam suffryd not þe pyne, Hir fest wyt hem was not holdyn, for-why Longe aftyr to ane holy recluse, suthly, She apperyd, &amp; bad þat hir solemnyte Next aftyr hir felowys holdyn shuld be. Thus martyrd were, as I me remembre, Of octobyr þe oon &amp; twenty day [per]de, And þe twelfte kalend of nouembyr, Þis multytude of uirgyns, wyth-owt pyte, Euene at Colane, þe feyr cyte, Whos bodyes þer restyn in a nunnerye, But here soulys duellyn aboue þe skye. And þat shuld bene noon obstaclys Of credens in þis seyd matere, Here holynes god hath by sundry myraclys Sheuyd here beforn ful many yere, Of wych whoso haue lust to here, Two þer-of to tellyn I wyl me dres Wych here legend pleynly dooth expres. Whylom in Coleyn ane abbote þer was, Wych, as it is told in here storye, Of þe abbasse desyryd for hys gostly solas Of oon of þese uirgyns to haue a body; And he hyr promessyd uerrey feythfully Þat wyth-jn a yere he hym wold dyspose In a capse of syluyr it for to close. And whan he it had on hys hye autere, He it doun set in a capsel of tre, &amp; so lete it stondyn a ful hool yere, Wyth-outyn a-mendement in eny degre. And for of promys reclese was he It lykyd no lengere þer to soiourne, But home ageyn fully it wold retourne. Wherefore, soon aftyr, whan þe monkys were All to-gedyr at matyns up-on a nyht, Seyng þeme al þat present ware þere, Thys uirgyn from þe awter cam doun ryht And lowly hir inclynyd to god almyht, And euyn amyddys þem dide pase, An returnyd ageyn to hir fyrst plase. And anoon furth-wyth þe abbot ran On-to þe capsye &amp; whan he it fond empty, He was, as he wel awte, ane heuy man. And on þe morowe he went to þe nunry And told þe abbase euyn by &amp; by Lych as it fel, &amp; in þe selue stounde Þer it fyrst was they ageyn it founde. The abbot wold feyn han had it ageyn, Or ellys a-noþir, but it wold not be: ‘For þis I wyl ye knowe,’ quod þe abbesse certeyn, ‘Syr abbot, syth it is so þat she Is frely comyn home, she ne shal for me Be remeuyd eftsonys, I you ensure treuly, And so þe abbot frustrat went home sory. An-othir myracle þer is told also Of a man wych was relygyous And þese holy uirgyns deuocyoun had to, Wych in-to syknesse happyd to falle greuous, To wham dyde appere a mayd beuteuous, Ryally arayid &amp; wundyr frech of hew, And askyd hym ryhtly yf he hir knew. Thys man, astoynyd of hir suddeyn cumyng, Þat he hir neuyr knew answerd pleynly. ‘I wyl þou knowe,’ quod she, ‘wythout doutyng, Þat I am oon of þat greth company Þat þou hast long louyde &amp; seruyde besyly. I come to teche þe what may do þe ese, And how me &amp; my felashepe þou mayst plese. Yff þou woldyst onys or þan þou deye, To goddys wurshyp and to aldrys honour, Eleuene þousend pater noster deuouthly sey, Thy reward shuld be for þis labour That of þi lyfe here in þe last our Geynys all þine enmyis þe to conforte My sustrys &amp; I shul to þe resorte.’ Whan þis seyd was she vanysht aweye, And he furth-wyth began, als deuouthly As he best koude, þese pater noster to seye, And neuyr dyde blyn tyl completly He had performyd euyn by &amp; by Þe noumbyr to hym þat she dyd stent; Wych doon, for hys abbot a-noon he sent, And seyd þus: ‘fadyr, wyth humble entent, Let me been anoyntyd &amp; þat hastyly.’ And as soon as he had take þat sacrament, Wyth a loude noyse he gan to cry: ‘Fleth hens, I beseche you al mekely, And yeuyth to þis holy uirgyns place, Wych hedyr gyn comyn of þere grace.’ The abbot hym askyd what he dyde mene, And he hym told al hys reuelacyoun. And anoon þei voydyd al bedene Out of þe chambyr aftyr hys petycyoun; And sone aftyr ageyn whan þei dyde come He was furth passyd wyth þis cumpany Of b[l]yssyd uirgyns to goddys mercy. Lo, þus hath bene shewyd, &amp; many wyse mo Than I now ethir can tel or deuyse, Thys felashepys holynes to-forn long go Of þem þat were both sage &amp; wyse, For wych I counsel ych man to ryse Out of syn &amp; to her worshepe to seye Eleuene þousend pater noster or þan he deye. And who þus wyl do wyth-out fayle, An be ful contryht &amp; cleen shreuyn also, Throgh here meretys it hym wyl auayle The end of hys lyf whan he cummyth to. And who-so lyst knowe how he may do Þis nowmbyr to perform euen in a yere The next kalende shewyth doctryn clere. Thre hundryd dayis sexty &amp; fyue Been in þe yer, neyþir mo ne lesse, As men by algorysme sone moun dryue, Vp-on wych pryncisple I dare expresse That þrytty pater noster ych daye wyt-out recchelesnes, Yf þat yche sonday oon be put þer-to, Makyth euene þe noumbyr, saue it addyth to. Now, blyssyd vrsula, wyth þi felashepe, Them al wych [y]ou do loue &amp; serue From al myscheuys to defend &amp; kepe Vouchesaf, &amp; in clennes þem to conserue; And þat noon of hem fynally to sterue In deedly syn, purchase hem grace Of uerrey repentaunce or þei hens pace. Amen mercy ihesu &amp; gramercy. Here begynnyth þe lyf of seynt feyth. Whylom whan fers dyoclycian Exercisyd hys cruel tyrannye, Wyth his cursyd compere, maximyan, Many a cristyn man he made to dye; For where þat ony þai myht aspye, Wyth-owtyn eþir mercy or pyte Them to be sleyn was her decre. For wych cause in-to ych cuntre They sent abouten thorgh here empere Cruel mynistrys of iniquite, Aftyr crystys seruauntys for to enquere Wych, wher þai myht of ony here, Anoon to þere emperour they hem sent Er ellys hym slow wyth dyuers turment. Among wych alse was oon dacyan, Oon of þe cruellest, as I do rede, For so fulfyllyd he was wyth sathan, That alle hys ioy was blood to shede Of cristene men, whare-fore grete mede He profyrde alle þo þat hym wolde brynge Of cristyne men ony manere tydynge. Thys cruel tyraunth in hys woodnes Fro cuntre to cuntre whyrlyd fast aboute, And made alle men both moor &amp; les To hys fals goddys to knelyn &amp; loute, And who-so nolde, þis is no doute, To hys commaundementys redyly obeye, Wyth hard torment he hem maad to deye. In þis mene tyme, as he dede kum In-to spayne þat royal cuntre A cyte he entryd clepyd agennum, Wher ryght anoon informyd was he How a maydyn þer was in þat cyte, Feyth be name, wych wold no wyse Goddys honouryn but hem dede despyse. Thys mayd born was of nobyllest blood Of al þat cyte as touchyng nature; And thow she fayre were, she also was good, And in al hir werkys both clene &amp; pure, Of contenaunce sad and of chere demure, Neythir in worde nere dede wantoun nere nyce, For no þing she hatyd but oonly wyce. No wundyr for she wel was applyid To cristys scole in hir tendir age, And in þe feyth groundly edyfyd Be hem þat were both wyse &amp; sage, So þat from it mycht noon outrage In no wyse hir hert do bryng, For aftyr hir name was hir lyuyng. Feyth was hir name, &amp; feythfully In cryst ihesu euyr trustyd she Wyth dowwys sympylnesse syngulerly Louyng &amp; wyth turturis chastyte; And for she nold lesyn hir virgynyte Oonly she chese, to be crystis wyfe And neuyr noon oþirs, to lesyn hir lyfe. For pleynly þis she trustyd welle, That þow she lost hir lyfe temporal, For cristys sake, hit shuld no delle Hir hurten, for she lyf eternal Shuld han þer-fore &amp; immortal, To wych fynally þat she myht atteyne, Refusyn she nold noon erthly peyne. Worldly wurshyp she set at noght, And rychesse as dung she dede despyse, For god to seruyn was al hir þoght, And flehsly lustys she nold appryse But hem forsuk, &amp; in no wyse She wold here ydols goddys calle, But deuelys dennys she clepyd hem alle. Whan þis tyraunth of hir dede here, Dacyan, fulfyllyd wyth malyncoly, Be-forn hym chargyd she shuld appere, And anoon hys men hir sowht bysely, But she hir offryd to hem frely, And þow þai hir fersly furth led Yet of hem she was no þing adred. But whan she shuld to þe presence Off dacyan be broght, wyth hert entere A tokyn of þe cros hir to defence She maad, &amp; wyth a deuouth chere Wyth mouth &amp; hert she maad þis prayere: ‘Lord þat regnyst in heuene aboue, Thys our me stedefast kepe in þi loue! Of eloquens, lord, yif me habundaunce Be-forn þis tyraunth whan I am broght, And in þi feyth myht &amp; constaunce, And by his tyrannye to set ryght noht, A[n]de also þat neythir in wurd no þought, Thow he me assayle wyth greuous turme[n]t, To here desyre þat I neuir consent.’ And whan she to þe presence of þe tyraunth Was broght, &amp; stood beforn hys syht Wyth debonayr &amp; wyth sad semblanht, Anoon he hir askyd what she heht, And she hym answerd euyn forth ryht: ‘Feyth clepyd I am, &amp; euyr haue be From þe tym of my fyrst natiuyte.’ ‘Feyth,’ quod he, ‘what is þi feyth And þi byleue? telle me hastyly.’ ‘Crystyn I am, for-suth,’ she seyth, ‘And cristys seruaunth I am treuly, And haf be syth dyscrecioun fyrst had I, Whos spouse to ben I haue me take, And neuyr for oþir wyl I hym forsake.’ Whan dacyan þis herd, wyth chere symulat, And half smylyng as hym had lyst to playe, ‘Fayre Feyth,’ he sayde, ‘be not obstynat, But wysly lyst what I þe seye. I wyl þe councellyn al a-noþir weye, Wych to þi beute &amp; to þi byrth, I-wys, And eek to þi youthe more spedful is. Yf algate chastyte þou wylt han Of body, fyrst do cryst forsake, And þan þe offre to seruyn dyan, Lych the in kynde, &amp; clothys blake Vse in hyr temple, &amp; I þe shal make [S]o hye in worshype &amp; ryches growe That men to þe shul goon ful lowe.’ ‘By þi promissys ne by þi feyr speche Pleynly I set ryht noht,’ quod she; ‘For, as holy fadrys doctryne doth teche, Noht ellis your goddys but deuyllys be. Where-fore I merueyle þat þou counselyst me Very god &amp; hys treu feyth despyse, And to fals goddys to do sacrifyse.’ Wyth þis answere he wex ful wroth, A[n]d specyally þat she hys goddys dyde calle Deuelys, &amp; swore a full greth oth That, but she wold doun prostrate falle And doon sacryfyse to hys goddys alle, Wyth newe tormentys wych neuyr were seye Beforn, he makyn hir shuld to deye. But feyth, wych foundyd in stabylnesse Was, &amp; of many gloryous martyrys Exeaunp[l]ys strenghthyd, &amp; sekyrnesse Had þorgh hoope [of] euyrlestyng blys, Ful stedfastly yaf ansuere þis, Þat for crystys sake al suche turmentrye She glad wold suffre &amp; deth eek treulye. Euene wyth þis he wood was, And wyth þe rage of woodnesse ouyrled He commaundyd þat to a bed of bras Wyth-out tarying she shuld be led, And in four partys þere-on be spred, And wyth strong chenys þer-to be fast bounde, And greth fyer made vndyr, hir to confounde. Whan she was broght where þis torment Of bras stood ful hoot brennyng, Wylfully Feyth þer-up-on went, And summe anoon wyth-out lettyng There-to hir bounde, &amp; summe dede bryng Pannys wyth colys, summe oyle &amp; grese There-jnne dede cast, hir peyn to encrese. Summe wyth forkys of yryn ful strong On þe grydyl hir turnyd up &amp; doun, Summe blewe so sore þat þe flaume up sprong Aboutyn hyr sydys euyn in-vyroun; Was noon þat had of hyr compassyoun Saf oonly þai wych þat stood bysyde, Wych for uery pyte here face dede hyde. And meny of hem þus dede crye: ‘O fers &amp; cruel tormentourys, We kun in no wyse conceyuyn why Thys blyssyd mayde wyth so sherp shourys Ye doon assayle, &amp; wyth so gret dolours Ye besyin you to makyn hir to sterue But for she god in heuene doth serue. O vnpetousnesse! o vnryhtful Domys! &amp; o peruers entent! To us it semyth ryht vnskylful That þis seruaunth of god, þis innocent, Shuld be slayne wyth swych torment, Wyth-out reward of hir tendyr age Or þe hy wurthynes of hir lynage. And yf ye lyst to wete what we wyl do, Vttyrly we forsakyn al ydolatrye, And feythis god we wyl turn to, For whom we be redy wyth hir to dye, And al your fals goddys we defye, Wych aftyr hir doctryn, as we beleue, Mown neþir helpyn men nere greue.’ Whan þis was tolde vn-to dacyan, He yaf þis sentens in þat stounde, That heuedyd of hem schuld ben ych man; And anoon many a body was throwe to grounde Heedles, &amp; Feyth þe moor to confounde, And to þe encres of hir tormentrye, Al þis was doon beforn hir eye. Op-on thylke syde of þe seyde cyte Where phebus &amp; hys ark meredyonal The shadwe doth throwe of euery tre, Of euery tour &amp; of euery wal, That is to seyne in þe plage septentrional, Ne[þ]m[o]st þe pool, wych shypmen doth guyde, Stant an hy hyl þe wallys euene besyde. Thys hyl is craggy &amp; eke cauernous, Ful of trees &amp; busshys, wych up to stye For þer thyknesse is full laboryous, Wyth-out weye or path men for to gye. But who-so þere be weel may aspye All þat is opynly in þe cyte doo, Yf he dylygently wyl attende þer too. In seyd hyl, fleyng þe persecucyoun Of cruel decyan, in kauys ful wyde Many a man þat tyme out of þe toun As for a mene whyle hem dede hyde, Of wych many oon, þat same tyde Þat feyth dyde suffryn hir tormentrye, Stodyn &amp; beholdyn yt by &amp; bye. Amonge wych stood oon callyd Caprasius, Of nobyl blood &amp; but yunge of age; And whan he saw Feyth tormentyd þus, He knelyd doun &amp; upward hys vysage He dede lyfte, &amp; wyth deuouth corage He preyid þus: ‘lord, for þi mercy, Yiue feyth of dacyan þe victory. And also, lord, yf it noon offence Be to þi goodnesse, I desyre moor: Syth ffeyth suffryth so greth uyolence Of peyn &amp; is tormentyd so sore, What reward shal she han þere-fore Here-aftyr, &amp; wheþir in þis tormentrye She ony counfort felyth or remedye.’ Whan þus endyd had hys preyere, A feyr whyte dow beforn hys syht, Commyng from heuen, þere dede appere, Beryng a croun of gold ful bryht, Set ful of gemmys þan þe sunne moor lyht, Wych, as hym þouhte, þeddyr dede flye Where ffeyth lay wrappyd in tormentrye. And ouyr hir as she dede houyn flekerynge Hyr wyngys softely she gan to shake, And wyt þe deu wych of hem dede sprynge The reed colys anoon wexyn al blake, And þerewyth Feythys peyns gunne slake, And wyth þe deu wych on hir dede falle Perfythly curyd were hir woundys alle. And anoon she clad was in a gowne And a mantel snow-wyht, ful solemnely, And þan þe dowwe þe gloryous crounne Set on hir heed, wych shoon heuenly, And whan alle þis was doon she sodeynly Took hir flyht &amp; to heuene ageyn Returnyd, &amp; was no more þere seyn. Whan Caprasius alle þis sey doon, Vp-on þe grounde deuouthly knelyng, From hys preyere he roos up ful soon, And þankyd god of þis tokny[n]g, Whereby he conseyuyd wythout doutyng T[h]at, wyth pacyence suffryd, peyn temporal Is þe ryht weye to ioye eternal. And as he roos, þe hyl sodeynly Wyth hys ryght hand he dede smyte, And anoon þer sprang meruelously A wel ful of watyr clere &amp; bryht, Of wych þe taste hath so greth myht That what seeknes ony man feel By þis martyris merytys he shal han heel. Aftyr þis wyth ryht ful glad chere From þe hyl a-loon he ran doun, And vnware to alle he cam nere Where feyth dede suffryn passyoun, And opynly he made þis confessyoun That cryst is god &amp; noon but he, And al oþir goddys deuyls be. And anoon þis tyraunth dede commaunde Hym to be presentyde be-forn hys syht; And whan he was comme, þis demaunde He askyd of hym, what þat he hyht, Hys byrth, hys kyn, &amp; anoon ryht Thys blyssyd Caprasius wyt-out feer To hys demaund þus dede ansuere: ‘Fyrst I knouleche, as for most worthy, That crystnyd I was in a funt of stoon Of a prest, &amp; Caprasius clepyd was I, Wherfor fals goddys wyl I worshyp noon, But hym I serue wych knytter is in oon Of iewys &amp; paynyms, criyst ihesu, For whom þis virgyn þou dost pursu.’ ‘I haue reuth of þe,’ quod dacyan, ‘That þou doost so erren in þi byleue; And for þou art so feyr a yungman, Me were full loth þe for to greue; And þat þou erryst I þus do preue, For of hys dyscyple cryst was betrayid, And a cros wyth torment to deth afrayid. And on swych oon þat for hys synne Thus was tormentyd to settyn affyance, I hold greth errour, wher-fore yete blynne, And of þi mysbeleue haue repentaunce, And of þi wysers lern bettyr gouernaunce, And wurshyp þo goddys wych dede [not] dye, And crucyfyde cryst wytterly dyffye. And yf to my counsel þou wylt assente, And be reulyd lych as I shal seyn þe, On[to] þe emperours I þe wyl present, Were þou þorgh þere famylyaryte Shal mounn commyn to greth dygnyte, To wurthy estaat &amp; to hey honour, And to be lord of many a castel &amp; tour.’ But Caprasius by alle þese profyrs hye Of wurshyp, welt, or of dygnyte, Wych dacyan hym hycht, he set not a flye, In crystys feyth rotyd so wel was he. ‘In hys paleys to duel leuyr is me,’ Quod he, ‘wych alle þingys wroght, And al mankynde onys fulle dere boght.

Werfore yete folwe þe counsel of me, And to wurshyp I wyl enhaunsyn þe.’ ‘Alle þi greth profyrs,’ quod Caprasius, ‘I wyl þou knowe þat I set not by, For I trust fully þat my lord ihesus Me to avaunce is moost myhty, Trewe in wurdys &amp; in werkys holy, Wych he[t]yth hys seruauntys in ioye to dwelle, And to hys rebellys þe peyn of helle.

Wherefore, o tormentours, I charge you That ye þis rebel wyth peynys assayle, And sparyth hym not, for he is yung &amp; tou, On euere syd makyn hys blood out hayle.’ And anoon þei hym betyn tyl þei dede fayle, And in alle his peynys he euyr dede cry Wyth ryht glad chere, ‘Ihesu, gramercy.’ And to þe peple about he dede preche &amp; seye: ‘Serys, dredyth not, I counsel yow, Thys tyraunth, ner hym neuere doth obeye, Whos powyr lastyth but a whyl now And shal passyn a-wey, no man wot how; But dredyth hym wych body &amp; soule may Throwyn in-to peyn wych lastyth ay.’ And at þese wordys of exortacioun, The peple besyde wept pytously, And seyng þis cruel examynacyoun Alle wyth o voys ful loude dede cry: ‘O vnpetouse men &amp; wyth-out mercy, Why vexe ye wyth so cruel torment This blyssyd man, þis holy innocent?’ For þis specyal prerogatyf had he Þat amyable he was to euery man Wych on hym lokyd, for bryht of ble He was, &amp; of colour neþir pale ne wan; And þat soor greuyd cursyd dacyan, So constaunth he was þat no peyne Myht in no wyse makyn hym to pleyne. And whyl þat feyth &amp; seyd Caprasius Thus turmentyd were fulle cruelly, Two brethyrn, Primus &amp; Felicianus, Among oþir peple stoden euyn by, And whan þei hem seyn suffryn mekely There peynys, on cryst þei dede beleue, And alle fals goddys in hert repreue, And thought þei myht no bettyr do Than to be ioynyd to þem tweyne; And euyn furth-wyth þei runne hym to And alle her hert opynly dede seyne, And anoon þei applyid were to peyne; And þus þese four, togedyr knyt sothly, Of furyous dacyan had þe victory. And whan he sey ych oþir counforte In þer peyn, &amp; eke uerteously To perseueraunce alwey exhorte, He wex nere wood for malyncoly, And bad to a temple wych stood faste by They shuld be lede, þere to sacryfyse, Or ellys to bene hefdyd in hasty wyse. But to þe temple whan thei were brouht, For no man þei wold do sacryfise But to þat lord þat alle þing wrouht, Redy to deyin in hys seruyse. Wherfore hefdyd, as dede deuyse Dacyan, þei were wyth-out lettyng, And so went to ioye þat is euyr-lestyng. And whan þese four þus heuedyd were, The cursyd paynyms ful cruelly In þe felde her bodyes left þere For to be deuourryd, ful vnpytously, Of bestys; but whan nyht cam, priualy Crystyn men dedyn alle here dylygence Them to beryin wyth greth reuerence. Nertheles but symple was þe place Ful meny yerys where þei dede lye, Wherfore whan sesyde þorgh goddys grace Was in þat cuntre al paynymry, And cryst hys Feyth dede claryfye, A bysshope was styryd of deuocyoun Of þem to makyn a translacyoun.

Thys bysshopys name was Dulcidius, A man of ryht syngulere perfeccioun, Wych in hys slepe was monystyd þus: ‘Dyffere no lengere þin entencyoun; But hastyly it put in execucyoun; For by þat dede þou mayst purchase Both to þe &amp; to þi cyte grace.’ And anoon he made a congregacyoun Of monkys &amp; clerkys whom he dede tel Clerly alle hys reuelacyoun And euene pleynly as it befel, And þai hym youyn al counsel It to performe, &amp; holpyn þere-to, And in short tyme it was do. And whan it complet was perfytly, Seynt feythys body he dede up take And þedyr he trans[l]atyd reuerently, And made þer a mynystir of munkys blak, Where god shewyd hath for Feythys sake Ful meny myraclys, þis is no nay, And yet doth sheu from day to day.

Agnes sacra sui pennam scriptoris inauret Et det ut inceptum perficiatur opus. Seynt Anneys lyf I me purpose After my kunnyng in ynglysh to wryte. As me doth techyn seynt Ambrose, Wych wyth hey style it doth endyte. Now, blyssyd uirgyn, me to vysyte Prey god wyth grace &amp; in swych wyse That suffycyently I me aquyte May my promyse to acomplyse. Moor-ouyr as louly as I kan deuyse I praye ych man þat it shal rede, Thow it be but rude, he hyt not despyse, For Pallas certeyn wold me neuyr lede Of Thully Rethoryk in-to þe motleyde mede Flourys to gadyrn of crafty eloquens, But euere þedyrward whan I me dede spede, Wyth greth dysdeyn she me bad go þens. And I yet hir preyid wyth vmble reuerence That she summe fauour wold sheu to me, And she me answerd in pleyn centence: ‘Thou commyst to late, for gadyrd up be The most fresh flourys by personys thre, Of wych tweyne han fynysshyd here fate, But þe þrydde hath datropos yet in cherte, As Gower, Chauncer &amp; Ioon Lytgate.’ Wherfore, syth Pallas me þus dede rate And drof me a-wey so sturdyly, I wyl neuyr-more wyth hyr debate, Nere presume to commyn Tullius medwe ny; And þerfore spekyn &amp; wrytyn I wyl pleynly Aftyr þe language of Suthfolk speche; And who-so-euere lyke not þer-by, Whereeuyr he lyst he bettyr do seche. Agnes of agna, who-so wyl it seke, Dyryuyid was, seyth Ianuence. Agna is a lamb, a best ful meke And sympyl also, aftyr hys sentence. Wych tuo to Anneys by good congruence Longyn, for in hem so groundyd was she, That fro meke &amp; symple eek innocence Remeuyn hir myht noon aduersyte. Anneys also, as þis clerk doth seye, Dyryuyid is of knowelechyng; And wurthyly, for she þe weye Of treuthe kneu whyl she was ying; Wych treuthe, aftyr austyns seyng, Contrary is vnto vycys thre Wych Anneys uenquyssyd in hir lyuyng, As falsheed, doubylnesse &amp; vanyte. By feyth she ouyr-cam falsnesse, And by hope she despysyd alle vanite, By cheryte perfyth al doubylnesse She set asyde, &amp; of þese thre In hir lyf we fynde good congruyte, Wych at þis tyme I ne wyl expresse Oonly to eschewyn prolyxyte, Wych oftyn of heryng causyth werynesse. O holy lamb of god, o blyssyd agnete, Wych enflawmyd in þi tendyr age Of þe loue of god wyth þe feruent hete So sore were þat no fers rage Of peyn myht chaungyn þi corage, Nere þin hert from hym no wyse inclyne, Me wyt purchace, lady, &amp; language Thy lyf begunne wyth to termyne. Her begynnys þe lyf of seynt Anneys. Yseruanht of cryst, bysshop Ambrose, To you holy uirgyns sende gretynge, Exhortyng you you forto dyspose The feste to halwyn of a maydyn yinge; In wych feste wyth psalmys suete soundyng Alle peplys mote gladyn in ych degre, And crystys pore men mote ioyeful be. Lete us now alle ioyin in oure lord; And to þe edyfycacyoun of uirgynyte, How martyrd was do we record Blyssyd Anneys whyl yung was she, For in hir threttende yere, as fynde we, Deth she loste &amp; lyf dede fynde, For oonly she louyd þe auctor of kynde. And þow she yung were by yerely computacyoun, Yet in hir soule she had suffycyent age, And so she was in dyfferent dysposycyoun As yunge of body &amp; of soul sage. And [þ]ow she fayr were in hir vysage Bodyly and endewyde wyth gret beute, Yet by feyth in hir soule feyrere was she. And whyl þis gemme of uirgynyte Oo tyme from scole hom turnyd ageyn, Of þe prefectys sone louyd was she, Wych of hir frendys hir sore dede freyn. Mych þing he offryd but more he hycht, certeyn, And ful precyous ornamentys wyth hym he broht, Wych of Anneys as dung were set at noht. But yet aftyr þat þis ioly yung man Of loue to hir felt more prykkyng, And wenyng she wold bettyr ornamentys han, Precyous stonys many bryht shynyng Wyth hym he brouhte &amp; ful many a ryng, And by hym-self &amp; by his frendys also Hys affeccyoun þe maydyn was told to. Ryches he profyrd in greth plente. Placys solemne &amp; eke staatly, Possessyons large &amp; mych mene, And of þis werd þe pompous glory, Vp condycyoun þat she nold deny To hym to be ioynyd in maryage. To whom þus ansuerde þis Anneys sage: ‘Go hens fro me, of syn norsshere And contraryous to euere good entent. Go hens fro me, for of a-noþir louere I wyl þou know þat I am preuent, Wych precyoushere ornamentys me hath sent, And wyth þe ryng of hys feyth hath ernestyd me Bettyr þan þow of kynrede &amp; dygnyte. My ryht hand arayid wyth-out doute Wyth a precyous beyl of gold hath he, And my nekke he gyrt hath ronde about Wyth precyous stonys wych incomparabyl be, And margarytes innumerable he hath youyn me, And wyth bryht shynyng gemmys me to guyde Me enuyrond he hath on euery syde. In my face he hath set a specyal merk Þat noon oþir shuld be louyd but he, And clad me in a mantel of gold woue werk, Many precyous nowchys where-in set be. Incomparabyl tresore he hath shewyd me, Wyth wych he hath hyht me to auaunce, If I in hys loue oonly haue perseueraunce. Wher-fore I ne may takyn hede to þe And han in contemp swych a louere, To whom I am knyt in ful cheryte, Whos kynrede þan þine ys hyere And hys puyssaunce &amp; myht mych strengere, Swetter þe loue, feyrere þe face, And of selynes mych gretere þe grace. Of þis louer my chaunnbyr arayid is, Whos organys han maad me melody, Whos maydyns here syngyng is uery blys; And takyn of his mouth many a kys haue I, Swettere þan eythir mylk or hony; And fulle oftyn in armys he halsyd hath me Wyth-out blemyssyng of myn u[ir]gynyte, Hys body to myn now conioynyd is, And wyth hys blood my chekys enbelshyd hath he, Whos modyr is a mayd, &amp; hys fadyr eek I-wys, Whom aungelys seruyn in humble degre, Of whom al-so merueylyn þe greth beute Both sunne &amp; mone, þorgh whos odour ageyn Dede men reuyguryn, I dare wel seyn. Hys rychessys neuyr doon a-wey krepe Wyth fortunys fykyl transmutacyoun, Where-fore to hym my feyth I kepe And euyr wyl wyth hertly deuocyoun. Where-fore lystne now to my conclusyoun, And take þis for answere in wordys pleyn: Oþir louyn þan hym shal I neuyr certeyn.’ Whan þis yung man had herd þe answere Of blyssyd Anneys, he wex ful heuy, And so sore blynd loue hym anoon dede dere Þat in soule both anguysshyd &amp; in body He syknyd, &amp; in hys bede he doun dede ly; But by hys greth syhys aspyid he was Of lechys, wych told his fadyr þe caas. And whan he sey þat þe affeccyoun Of his sone to anneys was set sore, Of alle hys profyrs he made iteracyoun In euery degre &amp; rathere more; But sekyr his labour was but lore, For pleynly she seyd þat in no wyse Hir fyrst sposys profyrs she nold despyse. And for he þat tym of þe prefecture In þe hey astate stode &amp; dygnyte, Hym þoht þat noon oþir creature To-forn hym in worshepe preferryd myht be, Wherefore he wundryd who shuld ben he Be whom þus anneys hir dede enhaunce, And of his tresoure made swych auaunce. And whyl he þus seyde, swych oon stode by As is wone to countyrfete &amp; iape ych man, Wych seyd þus: ‘syre, þis maydyn treuly From youth hath bene a crysten wumman, Whom so illudyd þe wycchecraftys han Wych he tawht and vsyde in cristen lore, That she wenyth þat cryst hir husbond wore.’ The prefect þis heryng ful glad was, And anoon he sent a greth cumpany Of [k]achepolles to bryngyn hir to his plaas. And as sone as she þedyr was com priualy He made hir a sermoun ful of flatery, And many greth promyssys hir dede behete, And aftyr he hir dede manacen &amp; threte. But crystys maydyn nethir wyth flatery Myht be deceyuyd ner wyth terroure, But wyth o chere in contenaunce perseuerently Be-forn hym she stode fresh of coloure; And for she rotyd was in crystys amour, Inward in hir hert on secre wyse, Both his behestys &amp; thretys she dede despyse. The prefect seyng in þis mayde ying So greth constaunce &amp; stedefastnesse, To hir fadir &amp; modir he spak of þis þing; And for he no myht hem no wyse dystresse By opyn vyolence, for here hy nobylesse, Welyng hem troublyn in a-noþir degre, Obiectyd hem þe tytyle of crystyanyte. And on þe next day presentyd to be Anneys he commaundyde hym beforn, And of [his] sonys loue ayen spak he, And hou he for hir sake was nere lorn; But of his wurdys Anneys made but a skorn, And whan he þat sey he dede hir be draw To his bench, executyd where was þe lawe. Quod he to hir, ‘but þe wychecrafth Of þese crystene mennys superstycyoun By sum maner wyse fro þe be rafth, Pleynly, aftyr myn opynyoun, Of þi brest þe madnes shal moun No man remeue, ne þou þine ere Wy[hs] counsel ne shalt moun bowyn to lere. Wher-fore þe auyhs is now of me, To þe goddesse uesta þe for to sende, Where, yf perseueraunce of uirgynyte The plese, þou mayst to it entende, Ant þan þe no man may reprehende If nyht &amp; day in humbyl wyse Þou occupyid be in hyr seruyse.’ ‘Yf þi sone,’ quod she, ‘wych wyth foule loue Is uexid—but yet he is a lyuyng man, Wyt hauyng &amp; resoun—I do reproue For crystys sake, &amp; wyl hym not han, Doum ydols to worshepe trowyst me þan, And to jniury of grace deuyne To ueyn stonys my heed inclyne?’ ‘I-wys,’ quod þe prefect, ‘my desyre is Sumwhat to support þe tendyrnesse Of þine age, where-fore our goddys The blasphemyng I dyfferre to dystresse, And for wyth-ynne wyt þou art yete, I gesse, Wyl not þi-self, I counsel, so despyse To wrathyn oure goddys swych fraward wyse.’ ‘Wyl þou not,’ quod Anneys, ‘þe youth appryse Of my body so, o prefect vycyous, Þat þou do suppose þat I in ony guyse Desyr þe to me to be propycyous. For not in bodyly yerys stant feyth uerteuous But in wyt of soule, &amp; god eek almyhty Wyt more þan age doth appreue sothly. And as for þi goddys, whos wrath me Thou woldyst not yn rynne, I þe beseche Whan-euyr þou lyst lete hem wroth be, And to me vsyn here oun propyr speche, And hou þai wold be wurshepyd me teche. But it wyl not be; wherefore aftyr þis Thou in me excercyse what þi wyl is. ‘Oon of two þingys chese,’ quod Sympronyan, The prefect, ‘o anneys, aftyr my decre: Or wyth oþir uirgyns þe goddesse serue uestan, Or wyth comoun wummen þou shalt abusyd be, Where þese crystyn wycchyse shul ben fer fro the, Wych wyth here crafth þe han youyn boldnesse To come so vnshamefastly to þis wracchydnesse. Wherefore sentencyally I þe deuyse, And yf þou þere-to take hede, Or to goddesse Vesta do sacryfyse To wurshype &amp; honour of þi kynrede; And yf þou ne wylt, my goddys me so spede, Of þi worthy byrth to confusyoun Thou shalt of comoun bordel be þe abieccyoun.’ Than blyssyd Anneys, inflammyd wyth grace And strengthyd wyth gostly stedefastnesse, Stondyng be-forn þe prefectys face, To hym hir sentence þus dede expresse: ‘If þou knou, wreche, in suthfastnes Who my god is, þe bettyr a-uyse Thou woldyst, &amp; not seyn on þis wyse. But for þat I knou þe hy uertu, The souereyn grace eek and wyrkyng Of oure lord god, blyssyd ihesu, I sekerly despyse al þi thretyng, In hys goodnesse fully trustyng Þat neþir I [t]o ydols shal sacryfyse do, Nere wyth synners vnclennes be defoulyd, lo. For þis also wythoutyn doute I wyl þou knowe, &amp; not þou oonly But alle þo eek wych stondyn aboute, Þat a keper I haue of my body, An aungel of god, wyche dylygently Me kepyth &amp; helpyth in euery nede, And þat me bold makyth þe not to drede. More-ouyr goddys sone, begettyn oonly Of his fadyr substaunce, immutable, Endlees of endlees eternally, Whom for þou not knowyst þou art dampnable, To me is a wal inpenetrabyle, A wecheman eek neuyr slepyng, A defendere also neuyr-more faylyng. But þi goddys, as wyse folk wel ken, Or ben of bras wych þat bettyr were To mak of caudrons to þe vshe of men, Or pottys or pannys or swych oþir gere. Wych meche myht helpe &amp; no þing dere, Or ellys of stonys, wych in a sloth to laye Wer bettyr, to skepyn from þe foul weye. For as it may be shewyd be by resoun, Dyuynyte wych þat is inmortal Hath in veyn stonys noon habytacyoun, Nere in bras, nere in noon oþir metal, But in heuene in þe regne supernal. Where-fore þou &amp; swych as hym wurshepe do Lyche peyn sekyr shul come to. For lych as þei in here lyknesse here Wych þei haue, as alle knowe we, Conflat were by a feruent fere, So shul here seruauntys in conform degre Wyth fere of helle be blowe, not for to be Foundyd as þai myscheuously Confoundyd, &amp; perysshyn eternally.’ The juge, that heryng, wex nere made, And comaundyd hir to be spoylyd shamefastly, And to þe bordalehous furth to be lad, A bedel þus fyrst makyng a cry: ‘Thys Anneys, þis wyche, proterfly Oure goddys skornyng wych doth blaspheme, To þe comoun bordel I iudycyally deme.’ But as sone as þis mayde dyspoylyd was, The bendys from hir here a-wey dede slyde, And swych thyknesse þere-to god yaf by grace Þat hire it enuyround on euery syde, And alle hir nakydnesse fully dede hyde, So þat bettyr curyde, as in sum degre, Wyth hir heer þan wyth clothys she semt to be. Whan anneys þus arayid ful deuouthly Þe place dede entryn of vnclennesse, Þe bordelhous I mene, she þere redy An aungel fonde wych dede besynesse Wytht lycht hir to curyn, of swych bryhtnesse Þat whan fully enuyround þere-in was she, No man hir myht neythyr touche nere se. And anoon al þe selle where she in was Thys gloryous bryhtnesse so dede illumyne, That neuere þe sunne in hys heuenely cumpas, Nere in hys most uertu, bryhter dede shyne Than þis hous dede by grace dyuyne; And who-so-euere presumyd it to aspye, A sodeyn blemysshyng he felt in hys yhe. And whan anneys þis bryhtnesse seye From god hir sent in hyr preyere, To hym prostrat she hyr dede dounn leye And anoon beforn hyr dede apere A whyht stole, &amp; wyth ful glad chere She yt took &amp; clad hyr þere-yn; And þan to god seyn she dede þus begyn: ‘Gramercy, lord of al ientylnesse, Of grace &amp; counfort &amp; of benygnyte To me shewyd, oonly thorgh þi goodnesse, Now and alwey in dyueres degre. Gramercy, lord, wych that nounbryng me Among þine handmaydynys hast me now sent From heuene þis newe &amp; whyht uestyment.’ And whan anneys þis cloth had on hyr do, Wych as whyht was as snow or lyly, So wele mesuryd yt was hyr body to, And conproporcyond so conuenyently, As þow it shapyn had be þere-by So þat no man thrust doute, wych yt dede se, Of aungels handys yt made to be. Lo, se now þis gracyous promutacyoun! A bordelhous is maad of preyere A specyal place &amp; of deuocyoun, In wych who-so entryd, wyth glad chere God worshypyng wyth hert entere He out went, clennere by goddys grace Than he dyde entryn in-to þat place. And whan þe prefectys sone dede here That Anneys in þe bordelhous was, He wex ryht mery &amp; of glad chere; And anoon wyth a cumpany of yunge felas He hym fast hastyd to þe seyd plas, Hopyng wyth hyre in hasty wyse Hys flesshys foul lust to excercyse. And whan he þere cam &amp; dede se Many yung men, wych wantounly Entryd þe place where-in was she, Owt ageyn comyn ful sobyrly And wyth greth reuerence, he sturdyly Hem rebukyd &amp; wrecchys dede calle, Seying, ‘veyn cowardys, foule you befalle!’ And þus hem skornyng anoon he went To þe place where Anneys lay in preyere, And for he malepert &amp; irreuerent Presumyd to entryn in-to þat lyht clere Where she was yn, er he cam nere He suddeynly doun fel up-on hys face, And þe deuyl hym stranglyd in þat place. And whan hys felas wyth-out dede se That he so longe taryid wyth-ynne And cam not oute, þei trowyd þat he Hyr had ouyrcomyn by sum gynne, And ocupyid ben in þe werk of synne; And anoon ran yn oon ful meryly To make a reioysshyng of hys victory. And whan he yn cam &amp; lokyd aboute, Upon hys face hym he found deed lye, And as he mad were he ayen styrt owte, And rendyng hys clothys he þus dede crye: ‘O nobyl romayns, doth þis wyche dye, Wych here wyth-ynne by hyr wycchecrafth Hath þe prefectys sone hys lyf berafth!’ And whan þe fame pupplysshyd was Of þis yung mannys deth thorgh þe cyte, Alle men gun ryn on-to þe plaas To beholde þis infortunate casuelte, And whan þei it seyn, in dyuers degre Wyth a lowd noys þei expressyd here entent, For summe clepyd hyr wycche, &amp; summe innocent. But whan þe prefect þese tydyngys herd Of hys sonys deth of þis manere, Euene as a madman anoon he ferd, And to þe theatre he ran wyth heuy chere; And whan þe body of hys sone dere Stark deed lyn þer he dede aspy, To Anneys lokyng he þus dede cry: ‘Of alle wummen o þou cruelest, On-to my dere sone in þis degre Allas þi wycchecrafth why was þi lest Thus cruelly to extende wyth-out pyte? What was þi cause, tel now me!’ And whan he to hir þus ofte dede seyn, She þus demurely answerd ageyn: ‘Thy sonys deth, syr, put not me to, For gyltles þer-of I am suthly; But he whos wyl he wold haue do Took power of hym &amp; þat ryhtfully. But þan yf þou þe cause aske why Alle othere wych ther beforn hym were Askapyddyn harmlees, I þus answere: Alle þo wych entryd fyrst to me, Whom goddys goodnesse þis greth lyht sent By an aungel, &amp; as alle men now se Arayid me wyth þis whyht garnement, They youe god þankyng wyth humble entent, And me to towchyn durst not prees, And þerfore awey they skapyd harmles. But he þis, þi sone, dede not so, But whan he in cam vnshamefastly Hys fleschly foul wyl he wolde haue do, And not reueren[c]yd þe lyht wych yn was I; And whan he presumyd to come me ny, The aungel of god in defens of me To þe deth hym drof, as þow doost se.’ ‘I-wys,’ quod þe prefect, ‘Anneys, by o thyng Euydently it shal appere to me That not by wychecrafth is þi werkyng, If þou þi aungel wylt preyn þat he My sone, wych þat I here deed se, Vouchesaf lyuyng to me restore.’ Whom Anneys þus answerd wythoute more: ‘Al-be-yt your feyth be not wurthy To han þis thyng wych ye ask,’ quod she, ‘But yet, for tyme yt is beforn þis cumpany Of peple þe uertu shewyd to be Of oure lord Ihesu, goth oute alle ye, That I may now, as I was won to do, The sacryfyse of preyere offryn hym to.’ And whan alle þe peple was goon oute, Anneys fel plat doun on hyr face, And wepyng ful soor wyth hert deuoute She preyid god of hys synguler grace That he wold shewyn in þat place A tokne of hys mercy &amp; of hys pyte, That reuycuryd myht þis yung man be. And anoon an aungel þere dede appere, Wyl þat she preyid ful sore wepyng, And lyfth hyr up &amp; made hir chere, And seyde þat grauntyd was hyr askyng. And anoon roos up wythoute tarying Thys yung man, &amp; out hym dede hye, And wyth a loude woys he þus dede crye: ‘Oo god, wych is of crystyne men, Is in heuene &amp; erth &amp; in þe se, For alle þe templys wych as ye ken To goddys ben made arn but vanyte, Ner þe goddys þere-in wych wurshepyd be, For hem-self nere oþire, wyth-owten drede, They helpyn ne mown in no nede.’ At þis wurd anoon ful loude dede crye The wycchys &amp; þe bysshops of þe templys also: ‘Put a-wey þis wycche &amp; mak hir to dye, For she myndys chaungyth &amp; turnyth ther-to.’ And wyth hir wurdys a sedycyoun, lo, Among þe peple dede grow moor Than it was many a day be-foor. The prefect, þis seying, astoynyd was, And was eek aferd proscrypt haue be Yf ageynys þe bysshops, as in þis caas, Of þe templys in ony wyse dede he In defens of Anneys ayens here decre; Wherefore, þe sedycyoun of þe peple to slake, A vyker in hys stede he anoon dede make. Wych whan was doon, ful hastyly Home to hys hous þe prefect went, And in hys hert he was ful heuy That he ne myht aftyr hys entent Anneys delyueryn from torment, Syth she hys sone as he had seyn From deth to lyf had reysyd ageyn. Aftyr þis, Aspasyus, þe prefectys vyker, The sedycyous peple assentyng to, Dede makyn anoon a ryht greth feer And Anneys in þe myddys he dede do. And forth-wyth þe flaumme departyd in two And on ych syde brent þe peple þer-by, But yt in no wyse cam anneys ny. Yet þe furyous peple þis nold ascrye To goddys uertu but to wycchys werkyng, Where-fore þei lowde dede blaspheme &amp; crye, And Anneys, in þe myddys of þe feer stondyng And demurely hir handys a-brood spredyng, Wyth þese wurdys of hert entere To god deuouthly made hyr preyere; ‘O almyhty god, most ful of uertu, And to be drede &amp; wurshepyd most wurthy, Fadyr of owre lord cryst ihesu, Blyssyd þou be for by þi sone suthly Wykkyd mennys thretys askapyd haue I, And þe deuelys vnclennessys thorgh þi grace By a path vndefoulyd I haue do pace.

Thys seyng, Aspasye, þe prefectys vyker, The sedycyous peple to plese the entent, Comaundyd a swerd both bryht &amp; clere Into hyr throte depe for to be sent, And þus þis holy mayde, þis innocent, Cruelly martyrd for crystys sake, To hym as hys spouse he dede take.

Thys constance was a quene gloryous And a prudent mayde, as seyth þe story, But a dysshese she had ful comerous, For sorys she had &amp; þat so many That from foote-sole to þe crounne on hy As many þere were as þer myht be, So þat no membre from sorys was fre. And for no lechecrafth of hir greth woo Myht in no wyse hir helpe ne cure, Hyr counsel yaf here þat she shuld goo To Anneys tumbe, þe virgyn pure, Wyth ful hope &amp; truste helth to recure. And so she dede, &amp; whan she cam there She deuouthly preyid, þow she heþine were. And as þis Constaunce lay in hyr preyere, Aslepe she fel euene vnwarly, And to hyr blyssyd Anneys dede apere, Seying, ‘o Constaunce, do constaunthly, And cryst, goddys sone, feythfully Beleue to be þi uery saluatour, And he shalle cure &amp; hele al þi langour. At þis voys dame Constaunce awook, As heyl &amp; as hool as she holest myht be, And on alle hir membrys whan she dede look There apperyd no tokne of infirmyte. And anoon to paleys home went she And tolde hyr fadyr &amp; hir brethyrn also Eeuen al þe processe as it was do; For ioye of wych was al þe cyte Gadryd to-gedyr wyth greth gladnesse; And [whan] þei had herd þis greth nouelte Greth wundyr it was to more &amp; lesse, Confoundyd also was þe vnfeythfulnesse Of hethyn peple, and of cryst Ihesu The feyth comendyd &amp; þe hye uertu, And anoon sprang a-brode þis opynyoun In Rome &amp; aboutyn in ych cuntre, That who-so-euyr come wyth deuocyoun To anneys tumbe he hoole shuld be, What-so-euyr were þere infyrmyte, Wych cryst to doon yet to þis day No wyhs man douthyth, þis is no nay. In þis mene tyme Constaunce dede preye Hyr fadyr &amp; hyr brethyrn þat for hir sake They grauntyn wold, &amp; it not geyn-seye, Ouyr seynt Anneys a cherche to make, And þere-by a place wher yn clothys blake She myht dwelle whyl hyr lyf dede dure, And seruyn seynt Anneys, þe uirgyn pure, Thys þe emperours dohtyr, blyssyd constaunce, Whan Anneys had curyd of alle infirmyte, In parfyth uirgynyte had perseueraunce, By whom many maydyns of Rome cyte, Both hy &amp; lowe and of euerych degre, To god &amp; to blyssyd Anneys þere Wyth an holy veyl consecrat were. And for feyth by deth suffryth no damage, Many of þe romayn uirgyns ying, Blyssyd Anneys folwyng wyth [deu]out corage As she in body þere were yet lyuyng, And by exaumple of hyr myhtyly wyrkyng, Ben perseueraunht, hopyng to get þer-by The gloryous palm of perpetuel vyctory. Lo, now haue I brefly acomplysyd Epilogus operis precedentis.

The lyf of seynt Dorothye. Whan crystys feyth yung was &amp; newe And not fully rotyd stedefastly, Many a tyraunth yt dede pursewe And it to confounde þem bysyid vttyrly; Amoung wych alle most cruelly Ther-ageyn owtragyd Dyoclycyan, Wyth hys compere in malyhs, Maxymyan. In whos tyme among oþir mo In Rome dede dwellen a wurthy man, Wych by senatours descendyd fro The hye &amp; noble blood Romylyan, Wych hycht, as þe story telle can, Dorotheus, &amp; egal to hys dygnyte, Theodora clepyd, a wyf had he. Thys dorothye, seyng þe persecucyoun Of crystys feyth grow, for he crystyene was, He Rome forsoke &amp; al hys possessyoun, Both vynys, feldys &amp; eek statly plaas, Wyth theodora hys wyf, feyr of faas, And here two dowtrys, of wyche Trystem Hyht þat oon, the tothyr Kalystem. And of Capadocye on-to þe kyngdam He fled, &amp; in-to þat royal cyte, As was hys fortune, of cesary he cam, Where of hys wyf a dowtyr gat he, Whos name þei clepyd Dorothe From þe fontstoon, &amp; in pryuy wyse The bysshop Apolynar hyr dede baptyse. Thys Dorothe, of youthe fulfyllyd wyth grace Of þe holy gost, in uertu euere grew, And in al goodnesse, whos synguler solace Was bodyly clennesse euere to pursew, And flesshly corupcyoun eek to eschew; And for to spekyn of bodyly bewte, She passyd alle þe maydyns of þat cuntre. But þe deuyl, wych euyrmore hath enuye Wyth clennes, þe prefect of þe seyd cyte, Fabrycius clepyd, of gloryous dorothye Prykkyd wyth þe loue so sore, þat he For hyr sent, &amp; of tresore plente He profyrd hyre, &amp; in many a thyng To endewyn hir, &amp; to weddyn hyr wyth a ryng. Whan Dorothe had herd hys talkyng, Stablysshyd wyth grace in hir inward thouht, These temporal delyhs hertly despysyng, Alle werdly rychesse she set at nouht. And whan she was beforn hym brouht, Dreedeles she confessyd euene opynly That crystys spouse she was trewly. Fabrycius wex wode wyth þis answere, And comaundyd anoon þat wyth-oute lettyng In-to a tunne men shuld hyr beere Ful of oyle feruently brennyng; But in hyr spouse ihesu trustyng, As mery &amp; glade þere-yn was she As wyth swete bawm she anoyntyd had be. Many a paynym, þis myracle seyng, To cryst conuertyd was inwardly; But Fabrycius, to wycchecrafth it ascryuyng, To prisoun hyr comaundyd be led hastyly, Where meetlees she was nyne days fully, In wych tyme by aungelys mynystracyoun Fed she was wyth heuenly consolacyoun. Aftyr þis tyme whan she was brouht Out of presoun þe Iuge before, And hir beute was dyscrecyd ryht nouht But rather encrecyd more &amp; more, Alle þo hyr seyn wundryd ful sore How she, þat so longe had be meteles, Myht in bodyly beute so sore encres. But fabrycius, blyndyd in hys madnesse, By þis greth myracle ryht noht set, And to hir seyd: ‘but þou wyth mekenesse My goddys wursshype wyth-oute let, I shal do þe be hangyn on a iebet.’ ‘God wurshepe I wyl, not deuelis,’ quod she, ‘Nere mawmettys, swych as þi goddys be.’ And wyth þat worde to þe erthe-ward She doun felle, &amp; ful deuouthly Hyr eyne up she lyftyd to heueneward, Preying þus: ‘lord, for þi mercy, Shewe þi myht here euene opynly, And proue by sum tokne from heuene now That þou god art, &amp; noon oþir but þow.’ And anoon a pyller of marbyl ful hy, Wych Fabrycius had set up on þat place, And þer-on an ydole foul &amp; lothly, Aungelys ful many, doun sent by grace, So vyolently dede al to-race, That neythyr of ydol ner of pyler Was no part left aftyr hyr preyer. And euene furth-wyth in þe eyr alofte Was herd a voys of deuelys crying On þis wyse: ‘why vexyst so ofte Vs, dorothye, maydyn tendyr &amp; ying?’ For wych cause from her myslyuyng Many a paynym þer conuertyd was, And for crystys sake martyrd in þat plaas. But on a iebet, and vpward hyr feet, Dorothye þei heng ful horrybylly, And wyth yerdys &amp; skourgys hir body beet, And wyth hokys of yren hyr flesh cruelly They al to-rent, &amp; hyr pappys vnpetously Wyth feerbrondys brent, &amp; aftyr hyr dounn Half-deed takyn þei shettyn in presounn. But on þe morwe whan þe day wex clere, And she was broht the Iuge before, Neythir spote ne hurt in hyr dede appere; Wher-of Fabrycius wundryd ful sore, And seyde þus to hire: ‘o wurthyly bore Feyr mayd, I counsel, yet turn a-geyn For chastysyd þou art ynow, certeyn.’ And þer-wyth anoon hyr sustrys tweyne, Trystem &amp; kalystem, he to hyr dede sende, Wych cryst forsakyn had for fere of peyne, By whom hyr to turne he redyly wende; But euene contrarye þat he dede entende Befel, for by hyre hyr sustrys both two Cryst ageyn perfythly conuertyd wer to. Fabrycius þis heryng was nere out hys mynde, And in hys madnesse he a newe torment dede feyne, For of þese two sustrys he comaundyd to bynde Eythers bak to oþers wyth a myhty cheyne, And in-to a fere hem kast to brenne botht tweyne; And whan þis was doon wyth a pale face Gloryous Dorothye he þus gan manace: ‘How longe wylt þou vs forth þus drawe Wyth þi wychecrafth from day to day? Now both þi systrys ben broht a-dawe, Yet yf þou wylt þou styl lyue may. Wher-fore do sacryfyse wyth-oute delay To my goddys, &amp; I wyl þe respyte, Or ellys þine heed I wyl of do smyte.’ Dorothie to þis answerd mekely: ‘What-euere þou wylt for my lord ihesu And my spouse to suffryn I am redy. And euere haue ben sen I hym fyrst knew, In whos gardyn, ful of uertu, Rosys wyth appyls I gadryn shal, And be myry wyth hym in ioye eternal.’ At þis worde þis tyraunth furyous Comaundyd hys tormentours wyth-oute lettyng That þei wyth stauys hir face beuteuous And wyth greth battys shuld al to-dyng, Tyl of hir face were no semyng; And whan þere-of no þing they se myht, In a dyrk presoun þei hyr shet al nyht. But on þe morwe whan she was brouht Beforn Fabrycius þe Iuge erly, As hool she was as she had ryht nouht Suffryd beforn of peynys sothly; Where-for Fabrycius, confoundyd vttyrly, Cowd no ferþer, but yaf þe decre Þat wyth-oute let she hefdyd shuld be. And as she wyth-owte þe wallys cam, Oon Theophyl preyid hyr schornfully, Wych prothonotarye was of þat kyngdam, That she sum rosys wold hym sendyn hastyly From hyr spousys gardyn, &amp; she feythfully Hym hyht þat she so do wolde, Al-þow þat wyntyr it was ful colde. And whan she brouht was on-to þe place Of her iewes by decollacyoun, She preyid god hertly of hys specyal grace For þo þat remembre wold hyr passyoun, That hem saue from euery trybulacyoun He wold vouchesaf, &amp; specyally from shame Of hateful pouert &amp; eek of fals name. Also þat he wold dew contrycyoun Hyr deuowtys grauntyn at hyr last ende, And of alle here synnys plener remyssyoun; And yf wummen wyth chyld of hyr had mende, That he þam hastly wold socour sende; And þat noon hous where were hyr passyonarye Wyth feer ner lyhtnyng shuld neuyr myskarye. And euene as she þis prayere had maad, A voys yaf an answere in þis degre: ‘Come loue, come spouse, &amp; be ryht glad, For þat þou hast askyd is grauntyd the, And for alle þat þou preyst sauyd shal be.’ And wyth þat wurde she dede inclyne Doun hyr heed hyr lyf to fyne. And as she þus dede bowe lowly, A chyld apperyd in purpyl feyr clad, Barefoot, &amp; wyth heer kurlyd semely, In whos clothys sterrys gylt bemys oute sprad, &amp; wyth thre rosys &amp; thre applys in hys hand he had A sportelet, &amp; doun up-on hys kne He hym set, &amp; offryd it on-to dorothe. And she hym preyid wyth ful humble entent That to theophyl þe scrybe he yt wold bere, And seyn þat she sent hym þat present As she hym hyht whan she was þere; And he forth went; &amp; wyth-oute fere The dynt of deth she toke mekely, And hyr soule to heuene euene up dede sty. Martyrd was þis blyssyd dorothye The yere of grace two hundryd &amp; eyhghty, If eyghte þer-to men doon applye, Of februarye þe syxten day suthly, Vndyr Fabrycius þe prefect cruelly, Ocupying þe empere dyoclycyan, As to-forn is seyd, wyth maxymyan. To theophile, stondyng þis tyme opynly In þe paleys, þis seyd chyld dede apere, And by þe hand hym tok &amp; led manerly Asyde, seyng: ‘þe rosys here Wyth applys þe sent my suster dere From hyr husbondys gardeyn, I dar wel say.’ And þis seyd he vanysshyd a-way. And anoon Theophyl to preyse began And to gloryfyen cryst, god of dorothye, Wych in þe monyth of Februarye kan, Whan frost &amp; cold þe erthe doth wrye, And on þe trees men leuys may [noon] aspye, To whom he wyl rosys &amp; applys sende, Blyssyd be hys name wyth-outyn ende. Thus for þe greth credybyl wytnesse Of theophyle &amp; of hys deuouth prechyng, Alle þat cyte both more &amp; lesse To cryst wer turnyd wythowte lettyng. But Fabrycius, alle þese þingys seyng, So sore astoynyd was in þis caas, That vnnethe he wyst where þat he was. And specyally whan he Theophyl sey Conuertyd &amp; prechyn so feythfully, Hys hert from hym was nere a-wey; But aftyr he hym wyth more tormentrye Assaylyd þan euere he dyde dorothye, For on many smal pecys hys body he hew And to bestys &amp; fowlys þe gobettys he threw. But fyrst þis Theophyl was baptysyd And howsyld alse ful deuouthly, And so wyth peynys aftyrward supprysyd Lych as I seyd erst, &amp; þat cruellye, And so folwyd hys mastrysse dorothye, And cam to cryst in blysse regnynge, Whedyr thorgh hyr merytys he mote us bryng.

Where-fore, lord, to þe alone I crye Wych welle art of mercy &amp; of pyte, And neythyr to Clyo ner to Melpomene, Nere to noon oþir of þe musys nyne, Ner to Pallas Mynerue, ner Lucyne, Ner to Apollo, wych, as old poetys seye, Of wysdam beryth both lok &amp; keye, Of gay speche eek &amp; of eloquencye; But alle þem wyttyrly I denye, As euere crystene man owyth to do, And þe oonly, lord, I fle on-to; Not desyryng to haue swych eloquence As sum curyals han, ner swych asperence In vttryng of here subtyl conceytys, In wych oft tyme ful greth dysceyt is, And specyally for þere ladyis sake They baladys or amalettys lyst to make, In wych to sorwyn &amp; wepyn þei feyn As þow þe prongys of deth dede streyn Here hert-root, al-be þei fer þens; Yet not-for-þan is here centens So craftyd up, &amp; wyth langwage so gay Uttryd, þat I trowe þe moneth of may Neuere fresshere enbe[l]shyd þe soyl wyth flours Than is her wrytyng wyth colours Of rethorycal speche both to &amp; fro; Was neuere þe tayl gayere of a po, Wych þan enherytyd alle Argus eyne Whan Marcuryis whystyl hym dede streyne To hys deed slepe; of wych language The craft to coueyte where grete dotage In m[yn] oold dayis &amp; in þat degre That I am in; wher-fore, lord, to þe Wyt humble entent &amp; hert entere In þis conclude I my long preyere: That I kunnyng may han suffycyently To seruyn þe deuocyoun of my lady Aftyr hyr entent, þat is [to] seyne, That I may translate in wurdys pleyne In-to oure langwage oute of latyn The lyf of blyssyd Mare Mawdelyn, To hyr goostly confourth in especyal, And of them generally wych it redyn shal; By wych redyng þat þai may wynne Fyrst remyssyoun here of al here synne, Lych as Mary Mawdelyn dede purchace, And þat aftyr þis lyf þey may [þorgh grace] To þat blys comyn wher-yn is she. Sey ych man Amen, pur cheryte. Amen mercy ihesu &amp; gramercy. The prologe of marie maudelynys lyf. Of a mary to wrytyn I wyl begynne The lyf, as god we yeuyn wyl grace. I mene not mary wyth-owtyn synne, Wych of al mankynde bare þe solace, But hyr I mene wych of hyr trespace In symondys hous whan she cam yn Padone thorgh penaunce dede purchace, And clepyd is Marye Mawdelyn. And wurthyly þis name Marye To hyr pertenyth, as it semyth me, For as legenda aurea doth specyfye, Maria hath þese interpretacyouns thre: Fyrst it betoknyth ‘a byttyr se’, ‘An illumynere’, or ellys ‘maad lyht’; And þese thre thyngys in excellent degre Thys blyssyd Mary maudelyn had ful ryht. And by þese thre þingys we vndyrstond moun Þe thre best þingys wych þis mary ches, As outward penaunce &amp; inward contemplacyoun, And vpward blys wych neuyr shal ses; Of wych god seyd wyth-owtyn lees That þe beeste part to hir ches mary, Wych euere shal endure &amp; neuere dyscrees, But wyth hyr abydyn eternally. The fyrst part wych þat hycht penytence Be-cause of þe synne, wych is getyng of blys, Shal hyr be byrefth by no vyolence; Ner þe secunde, of contemplacyoun, for þat is Contunyd wyth heuenely [ioy] wych neuere shal mys, Where fore it may not fayl in no degre; Nere þe thrydde, of heuene, may sece I-wys, For þe mesure þere-of is eternyte. For-as-mych þan as þis mary The best part chees of penaunce doyng, ‘A byttyr se’ be clepyd ryht conuenyently She may, me semyth, for in þat thyng Greth byttyrnesse she felt whan repentyng Be-hynde cryst she stood shamefastly, And wyth þe terys shed in hyr wepyng Hys feet she wessh ful deuouthly. In þat also þat of inwarde contemplacyoun The best part she ches in þis lyf here, To hyr longyth þe secunde interpretacyoun, Wych is to seyn ‘an illumynere’, Or ‘a yeuere of lyht’, in wurdys more clere; For in hyr contemplacyoun she took swych lyht Wyth wych many oon, as ye aftyr shul here, In goostly goodnesse she maad shyn bryht. In þat þe best part of heuenely blys Thys mary ches in hir affeccyoun, Wurthyly ‘illumynyd’ she clepyd is, For now abouyn in þe celestyal regyoun Illumynyd she is wyth clere cognycyoun In hir soule, and aftyr shal fynally, When complet is þe general resurreccyoun, Illumynyd bene in hyr gloryous body. This Mary is also clepyd Mawdelyn Conuenyently, aftyr Ianuencys decre, For þis wurd Magdalena, wych is latyn, By þe interpretacyoun betoknyth þingys thre, As ‘gylty’, ‘streynghthyd’ &amp; ‘wurthy of degre’; Wych thre þingys by dew applycacyoun Mown clerly shewyn what was she Beforn &amp; yn &amp; aftyr hyr conuercyoun. Beforn hyr conuercyoun she was gylty Be of synful lyuyng þe abhomynacyoun, Dysseuyrd from god &amp; heuenely cumpany, Dyffamyd also in þe werdys oppynyoun In Ierusalem &amp; in al þat regyoun; And bysydyn alle þese myscheuys here, She bounde was by an oblygacyoun Wyth þe deuyl to dwellyn in endles fere. But aftyr þis, in hyr conuercyoun, Whan she forsuke al hyr fyrst foly, And hyre repentyd of hyre transgressyoun, And wyth penaunce purchacyd hyr mercy, Than was she strenghthyd &amp; made myhty, For as many delytes as in sundry wysys Of synnys she hade in hyr body, So many of hyr-self she maad sacryfysys. Aftyr hyr conuersyoun eek in goostly grace How stroung she wex &amp; how myhty, Who lyst know, he not hens pace Tyl completly rede be þis story, Wych both of þe gospel, þat kan not ly, And of hyr legende to-gydyr is bounde, And he shal fynde þat, wher wrechydly Synne regnyd, grace doth superhabounde. Now, gracyous lady, Mary mawdelyn, Wych grace aftyr synne copyously founde, Let not sathanas wyth hys sotyl gyn Of þem þat þe seruyn þe soulys confounde. And specyaly, lady, lat þi grace redounde To dame Isabel, þe countesse of Hu; Counfort hyr, &amp; kepe hyr both heyl &amp; sounde, Isabella comitissa Eu. And alle temptacyouns help hyr to escheu. Also, lady, to þe humble entent Of hym uouchesaf for to intende, Wych at þe seyd ladyis comaundement To translate hym bysyde þi legende; Purchase hym grace hys lyf to amende Er þan he passe from þis outlawry, And help hem both up to ascende Aftyr hyr fatal cours to blysse heuenely. Amen. Her begynnys þe lyf of Marye Maudelyn. Thys blyssyd Mary Mawdelyn, To spekyn aftyr werdly dygnyte, Born was of þe most wurthy kyn Wych þat tym was in þat cuntre, For of þe royel blood descendyd she, Whos fadyr hyht Syre, a man wurthy, And hyr modyr clepyd was Euchary. A brothir she had wych vsyd waas In hys fyrst dayis to ben a soudyour, Lazarus by name, whom þorgh hys graas From dethe to lyf rasyd oure saueour At requeste of hyr &amp; hys herbeiour Marthe, hyr sustyr as doth testyfye Ihon in hys gospel, wych wyl not lye. And þese thre, as seyith þe story, Twyn hem dyuydyd þe possessyoun Of here genyturs, Syre &amp; Euchary, So þat a castel callyd Magdalum To Mary fel in þere departysoun, Where-of she namyd was Magdalyne, As Ianuensys legende doth determyne. And not oonly þis Marye by successyoun Thus of fortune surmountyd in dygnyte, But also þorghoute al þat regyoun She of naturys yiftys had þe souereynte And passyd alle wummen [in] excellent bewte, For, as it semyd to yche mannys syht, Feyrer þan she no wumman be myht. Thus þan in hyr were þese thre To-gedyr ioynyd in greth excellence, Youthe, abundaunce, &amp; eek beute, Wych oftyn for lak of deu dylygence Mynystrys bene vn-to insolence, And of alle vycys þe bryngers yn, And so þei were in Mary Mawdelyn. For al hir youthe in dislauynesse Of hir body so vnshamefastly She dispendyd, &amp; in synfulnesse So comoun she was, þat ful pytously Hir name she lost, for of foly So in þe cyte was sprungyn hir fame, That ‘Marie þe synnere’ þei dede hir name. Thus long tyme in hir wrecchidnesse She contunyde &amp; hyr lustys dede pursu, Tyl at þe laste, thorgh þe mercyfulnesse Compunct she was of our lord ihesu, Wych þat lyuyd &amp; tawt uertu, Thorgh whos doctryne she was in entent Of hir fore-lyf to makyn a-mendement. Vp-on wych sone aftyr, as she wele knew, Whan to mete was bodyn oure saueour Wyth oon symon leprous, a pharysew, A precyous oynement swet of odour She went &amp; bouht, &amp; in þat same oure The box wyth oynement in hir hand she nam, And vnbodyn to symondys feste she kam. And whan she w[as] comyn in-to þe place Where Ihesu was, for shamefastnesse Of hir foul lyf, beforn hys face She nold appere, but dede hir dresse Behyndyn hys bak, &amp; wyth greth byttyrnesse And sorwe of hert she gan to wepe, And fel doun &amp; towert hys fete dede crepe. Where whan she cam, wyth hert contryte Terys owte she shede so plenteuously That hys feet þere-wyth wasshyn she myht, And so she dede ful deuouthly, And wyth hyr herys hem wypte dylygently, And aftyr þat wyth a deuouth entent Hem anoyntyd wyth þe swet oynement. And þow wyth hir mouth outwardly To hym no wurde she dede expresse In al þis tyme wych so besyly She shewyd þis meke obsequyousnesse, Yet, of hyr wepyng by þe grethnesse, Of hyr herte she shewyd þe corage, As þow she had vsyd þis language: ‘O moste meke lord, wych knowyst al þinge, And art of hertys þe inward knoware, Wych, as it semyth by þi techynge, Desyryst not þe deth of a synnere But þat he be conuertyd &amp; lyue lengere, Thou knowyst wele, lord, as I do wene, What my wepyng, my syhyng &amp; my sorwe doth mene. Y am a synnere, &amp; of euery cryme Wyth spottys defoulyd ful horrybylly, And so haue I contunyd ful long tyme Syth wyt &amp; dyscrecyoun fyrst had I; Reforme me now, lord, for þi mercy, And in þis greth nede be my socour, Wych oonly consydryst sorwe &amp; labour.’ Whan symon þis wumman at crystys fete Thus ocupyed sey, he thowte thys: ‘If he þis were a very prophete, He shuld weel knowe wyth-oute mys Wych &amp; what manere þis wumman is; For a synere she is, &amp; of bad fame Thorgh-oute þis cyte labouryth hir name.’ But cryst, wych þat knowyth al þinge, Both wurd &amp; werk &amp; thouht pryuy, Welyng yeuyn Symund a rebukyng Of hys temerary doom, ful benygnely To hym hys chere turnyd &amp; seyd goodly: ‘Symon, sumwhat I haue to sey to the.’ ‘Maystyr, what þou wylt, sey anoon!’ quod he. ‘Two detours,’ quod cryst, ‘to oon feneratour Were whylom, Symund, in a cuntre. Fyue hundryd pens owht þe toon detour, The tothyr but fyfty; &amp; for pouerte Hem both distreynyd, bothen pardonyde he. Than ask I þe, symon, wych of þese tuo Dettours þe credytour was moste holdyn to?’ ‘I-wys’, quod symund, ‘as it semyth to me, Aftyr þe iudycyal of uery resoun, To louyn hys credytour most holdyn was he Wych of hys dette had most pardoun. This is plenly, maystyr, myn opynyoun.’ ‘Thou answeryst’, quod cryst, ‘ful ryhtfully, Symon, but now herkyn what seyn shal I. Symon, I entryd in-to þine hous, And to myn feet watyr þou youe noon me; Thys wumman whom þou demyst vycyous, Syth þat she entryd, as al men may se, Wyth terys of hyr eyne shede in plente My feet she hath wasshyn ful deuouthly, And wyth hyr herys hem wypt dylygently. Kys profyrdyst me noon, but she my feet Hath kyssyd ful oft; nere myn heed to Oyle puttyst þou noon, but wyth oynement swet Anoyntyd she hath my feet both two. And for she þus hath þis dede do And so many loue tokynnys shewyd to me, Many synnys to hyr forgeuyn now be.’ And whan she þus on-to þe pharysewe Excusyd was by cryst ful curteysly, Alle þingys left, she dede hym sewe Wher-so-euere he went ful deuouthly. And for she ryche was habundaunthly, She mynystyrd hym &amp; hys in þere nede, As in lukys gospel pleynly men may rede. And þus aftyr by processe successyfly Wyth cryst she grew in swych famyliaryte, That hyr he chershyd ryht syngulerly, And wyth hyr sustyr oftyn herberwyd was he, Wych for hym &amp; hys kepte hospytalyte, I mene marthe, from þe flyx whom he dede cure Wych twelue yere to-gedyr on hyr dede dure. Thys was in Bethanye, where to-gedyr dede dwelle Marthe &amp; Marye &amp; hyr brothir Lazarus, Whethyr ful oftyn, as þe gospelys kun telle, To hys herberwe turnyd oure lord Ihesus, For in þe cyte of Ierusalem he was odyous, Where ful seldom he ony coude fynde Wych hym to herberwe wold be so kynde. O how blyssyd &amp; happy was þat hous In wych to takyn hys hospytalyte Vouchyd-saf þat lord most gracyous! Ful blyssyd also were þei al thre Wych chosyn wern hys hostys for to be, And hym to fedyn in hys bodyly nede Wych aungels fedyth wyth hys godhede. Lo, þus may we seen how euere mercyful God is, &amp; synners ful besy to saue, By þis wumman in specyal, wych synful Fyrst was, &amp; aftyr dede mercy craue, Thorgh wych not oonly she dede haue Of hyr greth synnys a remyssyoun, But also she atteynyd to hy perfeccyoun. And not oonly she atteynyd to perfeccyoun Of hooly lyf, but eek so syngulerly To cryst she extendyd hyr affeccyoun, That where-euere he was she drew hym ny And lystnyd hys wurdys ful deuouthly; Where-fore whan ony wythe hyr dede acuse, Euere redy was cryst hyr to excuse. Example vs shewyth in hys gospel Seynt Luke, seyng þat oure lord gracyous Ihesus whylom entryd in-to a castel, And Martha hym receyuyd in-to hyr hous. But Marye hyr sustyr was so desyrous Hys wurdys to here, þat for deuocyoun Euene at hys feet she hyre set doun. Where whan Marthe, wych dede besynesse Cryst to seruyn, hyr syttyng sey so, She began to acusyn hyr ydylnesse And seyd, ‘o lord, chargyst þou not, lo, How me my sustyr suffryth a-lone to do Al thyng? I prey þe byd hir up ryse And helpyn me to doon to þe seruyse’. But cryst, wych iuge was interpellat, As seyith seynt Austyn in a sermoun, Anoon be-cam Maryis aduocat, And a-geynys hyr sustrys acusacyoun He fonde a resonable excusacyoun; And anoon to Marthe in hyr besynesse Hys entent þis wyse he gan to expresse: ‘Martha, Martha,’ quod he, ‘þou art besy, And a-boute many þingys troublyd ful sore; But oon þing sykyr, Marthe, is necessary, Wych Mary hath chosyn: to lestyn my lore, Wych neuere shal fayle; wete weel þerefoor That þe bettyr part sothly chosyn hath she, Wych takyn from hyr shal neuere be.’ Be þis processe we seen þat þe ocupacyoun Of actyf lyf in þis mortalyte, To þe lyf of inward contemplacyoun May in no wyse paryfycat be; Wych two lyuys fyguryd fynde we In þese two sustres, Marthe &amp; Marye, As up-on Ihon seynt Austyn doth testyfye. Marthys lyf wyth greth byttyrnesse Medlyd is, but þe lyf of marye Is enbaumyd al wyth swetnesse; Yet bothen ben good, as doth dyscrye The exaunple beforn, wherfore enuye Betwyn þem tweyn owyth no more to be Than is betwyn a posatyue &amp; a comparatyue degre. More-ouyre, to shewyn þe syngulerte Of loue wych haddyn ryht specyally Of god past oþire þese personys thre, Seynt Ioon in hys gospel seyth þus pleynly: ‘God louyd Marthe,’ quod he, ‘&amp; hyr sustyr Mary, And Lazer þe broþir of þem bothe tweyne.’ No wytnesse of loue may be more pleyne. But yet in loue among þese thre, To spekyn aftyr degrees of comparysoun, Mary stood in þe superlatyue degre, As by processys folwyng we shul see moun, Both beforn &amp; aftyr þe resurreccyoun; Beforn, in þe myracle whan cryst from helle Lazer dede clepyn, as Ioon doth telle. Whan Lazarus langwyryng in bethanye Lay seek, &amp; cryst þane was absent By-yunde Iordan oute of Iewerye, Marye &amp; Marthe a massagere sent Thedyr to hym wyth þere entent, Vndyr þis forme &amp; by þese wurdys: ‘Loo, he whom þou louyst, lord, ryht seek is.’ And in þis mene tym lazer dede dye, And þan cryst þus seyd to hys dyscyplys: ‘Lazarus oure frende slepyth sothlye. Lat us go wake hym’; þan þe seyd þis: ‘If he be a-slepe he safe ynowe is. What shulde we do þere? hast þou forgete How þe to be sleyn þe Iewys do threte?’ Than cryst hem tolde euene opynly That Lazarus deed was, in wurdys pleyn; Wherfore returnyn on-to Iewery He wold, hym for to clepyn ageyn From dethe to lyf, þis is certeyn. And anoon furth-wyth he dede hym hye Euen in þe ryht weye to bethanye. But for to drawyn to þe conclusyoun Of oure entent &amp; to leuyn many a circumstaunce, Marthe fyrst met hym wyt-owte þe toun, And hadde wyth hym a long dalyaunce, But Marye was at home in hyr careful traunce Tyl of crystys comyng she warnyd waas, And þan to hym she went a ful greth paas. Whan she hym saw, ful sore wepyng She seyd þus: ‘lord, yf þou hadyst here be, My brothyr, as pleynly is my trowyng, Had not be deed as now is he.’ And whan cryst hyr sey wepyng, for uere pyte He wept also, &amp; to hyr þus seyd: ‘Wher is þe place wych ye hym in leyd?’ Whedyr whan he was come þei dede seye, Stondyng ful euene by þe grauys brynke, ‘Syre, four dayis ben past syth he dede deye, Wherfore we trow þe body doth stynke; And so but veyn were, as we now thynke, Ony more to doon.’ ‘yet,’ quod he anoon, ‘From of þe graue remeuyth þe stoon.’ And whan þe stoon was of he gan to pleyne And to be troblyd in spyryht ful meruelously, And up to heueneward lyftyng hys eyne, Wyth a greth voys he þus dede crye: ‘Lazer, come owte!’ and anoon hastyly He owt cam bounde, &amp; hys discyplys to Cryst hym delyueryd hys bondys to vndo. A ful wundyr sychte yt was to se That he foure dayes wych deed had leyn, And sempt, as is seyd, stynkyng haue be, Shuld þus to lyue be reysyd ageyn; But in þis mater is no more to seyn But þat swych merueyls loue kan do: Quia fortis ut mors est dileccio. And soon aftyr þis, at a super In symoundys hous whan Ihesu was, And oon of þe sytters was seyd Lazer, And Martha dede mynystryn in þat plaas, Marye, enflawmyd wyth goostly graas, Anoon wyth a ful precyous oynement Crystys feet to a-noynte deuouthly went. And whan she hys feet anoyntyd had weel, And he þerwhylys dede syttyn ful stylle, Vp-on hys heed she poryd þe toþir deel, Whos odour alle þe hous dede fylle. Quod Iudas, ‘þis oynement why do ye spylle, For thre hundryd pens wych myht sowld be And delt to pore men in þis cyte?’ And anoon cryst, Marye for to saue From blame, vsyng hys aduocacye, Seyd þus: ‘pore men ye alwey shul haue Wyth you, syres, but not me sothlye; Wher-fore þis wumman wych deuouthly Me to anoynt dede hir besy cure, A mysterye hath shewyd of my sepulture. Where-fore I wyl þat ye wel knowe, Hereaftyr whan þe gospel shal be Thorgh-owte þe werd by prechours sowe, Than shal it be seyd in many a cuntre That þis she dede in wurshype of me.’ Lo, þus þat iudas seyd hir to confounde, Cryst to hyr laude it made redounde. See now þan how þis perfyth creature Conioynyd was on-to hyr creatur, Of trewe loue þorgh affeccyoun pure, And eek he to hyr in syngulere amour; For nere of hys lyf in þe last our, Euen but a lytyl beforn hys passyoun, Of hyr he made þis specyal commendacyoun. More-ouyr aftyr þis, whan cryst was take And cruelly naylyd up-on a tre, And alle hys dyscyplys hade hym forsake, So feruent to hym was hyr cheryte That for no feer she fro hym wold fle, But euere on hym she was waytyng, Tyl he beryid was euyn in þe euenyng. And whan he was beryid, wyth greth murnyng She went swete oynementys for to bye; And aftyr þe sabat þe next morwenyng On-to þe sepulcre she gan hyr hye, And wyth hyr went a-nothyr Marye; And of here þedyrgoyng þis was þe entent, Crystys body to anoynt wyth here oynement. But whan þei come þer &amp; he was goon, As an aungel hem tolde þat same tyde, And alle o[þ]ir wentyn a-wey a-noon, She al oonly þere dede abyde, And in þe graue ful oftyn on euere syde She lokyd besyly wyth a wepyng yhe If hyr loue onywhere she myht aspye. And for-as-myche as she so parseueraunth was In abydyng whan oþir wentyn a-weye, Therfore she had þat specyal grace That fyrst of alle owre lord she seye, Apperyng, as hym had lyst to pleye, In þe lyknesse of a gardenere; But whan he seyd ‘Marya’, she knew hys chere. And whan she hym knew, on-to hys feete Wyth ful glad hert she doun dede falle, And wold hem han kyssyd but he nold hyr lete, But þus seyd, ‘Marye, þe not appalle; And go sey Petyr &amp; my dyscyplys alle That I am up rysyn, as þou doost se, And shal beforn hem goon in-to Galyle.’ Lo, þus &amp; many ano-þir wyse, As in þe gospelys men mown aspye, And myche bettyr þan I now kan deuyse, Pryuylegyd was þis blyssyd Marye Wyth synguler chershyng of hyr loue, Messye, Both in hys lyuyng &amp; in hys passyoun, And from deth to lyf aftyr hys resurreccyoun. Nowe I haue shewyd, aftyr þe gospel, O þis Maryis lyf a greth party; Of þe remnaunht furth now wyl I tel, Lych as Ianuence yt doth dyscry, If grace my wyt &amp; my penne do gye, And god also my state so longe Tyl yt be doon vouchesaf to prolong. But er þan I ferþer in þis matere Wych I haue promyssyd do procede, I þe beseche, Marye, wyth hert entere, Purchase me grace bettyr lyf to lede Than I do yet, &amp; þat lady spede In all hyr werkys &amp; get hyr blysse Wych of þis wrytyng cause princypal ysse. The fourtende yere by trewe computacyoun Aftyr cryst was rysyn from deth to lyue, Whan Steuene wyth stonys had throw doun The iewys, as Ianuence doth dyscryue, And owte of iewrye crystys dyscyplys dede dryue, Ful many a cuntre þe dede seche, Goddys wurdys þer-in to sowe &amp; teche. And in þe tyme of þis persecucyoun, lo, Lych as seyd Ianuence doth telle, Oon of þe seuenty dyscyplys &amp; two In Ierusalem wyth apostyls dede dwelle, To whom by petyr, as it befelle, Commyttyd was Marye Mawdelyn; And þis dyscyplys name was Maxymyn. And wyth þese two were, þe soth to telle, To-gedyr assocyid in oo cumpanye, Lazer &amp; Marthe &amp; eek Marcelle, Hyr handmaydyn, &amp; blyssyd Cedonye, Wych as þe gospel doth descrye Blynd was from hys natyuyte, And cryst hym meruelously made to se. These alle to-gedyr &amp; many anoþir Of crystene men, by the cruel decre Of iewys, wyth-owte sterne or rothyr In a shyp were set up-on þe se, To þat entent þei drynklyd shuld be; But as goddys prouydence hem dede gye Alle saf to Marsilye þei dede applye. Whedyr whan þei cam, wyth humble entent They þankyd god of þare passage, And euene furth-wyt to londe þei went; But þam wold no man grauntyn hostage. Where-fore þei tokyn her herbergage In a porche, tyl þat bettyr myht be, Of a temple of þe folk of þat cuntre. And whan blyssyd Mawdelyn dede se Mych folk þiddyr comyn to sacryfyse To þere ydols, ryht anoon she Wyth a plesaunth chere up dede ryse, And wyth a feyr face in dysert wyse She hem reuokyd from hyr ydolatrye, And prechyd hem cryst most stedefastlye. Alle þat hir herdyn awundryd were, What for hyr beute on þat o party, And for þe facundye wych she oysyd þere, And for þe swetnesse eek of hyr eloquency, Wych from hyr mouth cam so plesauntly Þat þei haddyn a uery delectacyoun Stylle to stondyn &amp; here hyr predycacyoun. And no wundyr þow þat mowth sothly Wych so feyr kyssys &amp; so swete So oftyn had bredyd &amp; so deuothly Vp-on cryst oure saluatourys feet, Dyuers tymes whan she hym dede mete, Past oþir swych grace had in fauour Of goddys wurde to shewe þe sauour. Soon aftyr þis, on-to þat phane The prynce &amp; hys wyf of þat cuntre Come to sacryfyse to dyane, That a chyld hem send wold vouchesaf she; And whan Mary Mawdelyn þis dede se, Of cryst she hem made a long sermoun, And counselyd hem to leue þere superstycyoun. But at þat tyme, þe soth to seyn, Maryis wurdys auaylyd no thyng, For as þei cam þei hom ageyn Wentyn, obstynate in here errour stondyng. And not longe aftyr, whyl slepyng Was þis lady, to hyr appere Dede Mawdelyn, seyng on þis manere: ‘Why is þat þine husbonde &amp; þow here In rychesse habounde þus plenteuously, And in hungyr &amp; colde goddys seyntys dere Ye suffre to perysshyn myscheuously?’ And hyr dede thretyn þat she trewly Shuld hyr repent, but she wolde meue Hyr husbonde þere myschef to releue. But she ne wold for no thyng To hyr husbonde tellyn hyr vysyoun; Wherefoor, on þe next nyht folwyng, Whan she dede slepe as she was woun, In alle wysys to hyr lych apparycyoun Mary Mawdeleyn made &amp; in conform degre, But yet to hyr husbonde tellyn nolde she. And for she ne wolde hyr byddyng do, The thrydde nyht Mary dede appere, Whyl þei dede slepe, to hem both two, Angrely &amp; wyth a brynnyng chere As alle þe hous had been afere; And on hem lokyng wyth a ferful eye, To hem both to-gedyr þus dede seye: ‘Art þow a-slepe, o tyraunth cruel, And a membre of þi fadyr sathanas, Wyth þis serpent þi wyf wych nold tel To þe my wurde as she bodyn was, For she þe nolde heuyin wyth þe caas? Where-fore, syth she my erand ne wold do, I now appere to-gedyr to you both two. What resoun is þis, þou cursyd enmy Of crystys cros, þat þow fed shalt be Wyth dyuers metys þus dylyccatly, &amp; aftyrward þus esyly to restyn þe, And goddys seruauntys þou doost se Wyth hunger &amp; myschef beforn þine eye Perysshyn? wherfore þou shalt abye.

And to hyr husbonde, wych eek made mone For þe same cause, wyth-owte lettyng Euene þus she seyde, for drede quakyng: ‘What chere wyth yow, syre? dede ye owt se Thys syht þat I had in my visyoun?’ ‘Ya, ya, wyf! &amp; þat causyth me To be now in greth trybulacyoun. I ne woot what best we do moun: Whyddyr to be reulyd aftyr hyr byddyng, Or ellys stylle to kepe oure owlde lyuyng.’ ‘I-wys, syre,’ quod she, ‘myn opynyoun Is þis, þat bettyr it is to obeye Than to fallyn in-to þe indignacyoun Of hyr god, &amp; myscheuously deye.’ ‘Be yt so þan,’ he anoon dede seye. And aftyr to here hous þei hem dede lede, And mynystryd hem alle þat þei had nede. Whan Mary soon aftyr up-on a day Prechyd, þe prynce hyr askyd opynly: ‘Trowyst þat þou defende may The feyth wych þou techyst so besyly.’ ‘Ya, þat I may,’ quod Marye pleynly, ‘Be dayly myraclys &amp; by wytnesse I-wys Of oure maystyr Petyr, wych at Room is.’ Than þus quod þe prynce &amp; hys wyf also: ‘Lo, we be redy in al þinge to obeye What-euere þou comaunde us to do, Vp-on a condycyoun þat we þe seye. That is to seyn, yt þow wylt preye Thy god to us þat a chyld be bore To been oure eyr; we ask no more.’ ‘I-wys,’ quod Marye, ‘&amp; in þis matere As for þis þing shal no lettyng be.’ And anoon she gan wyth hert entere For hem to preyin, &amp; herd was she; And wyth-yn short whyle, as men myth se, Thys lady conceyuyd &amp; wyth chylde was, Wych to þem bothe was greth solaas. Whan þis prynce wyth chyld hys wyf seye, He hym dysposyd fully for to beleue, And to Petyr he purposyd to take þe waye, Maryis doctryne þat he myht preue. Vp-on wych purpoos to takyn hys leue To hys wyf he went wyth deuouth chere; And she hym answerd on þis manere: ‘A, good syre, what woldyst þow do? Woldyst þou þus now forsakyn me In þe plyht þat I am now come to? Nay, nay, certeyn yt may not be, For douthles I wyl goon furth wyth þe And partener been of þine euenture, As longe as þe lyf in my body wyl dure.’ ‘Nay sekyr, wyf, so may it not be,’ Quod þe prynce, ‘in þe plyht ye arn yn now; For many greth peryls ben in þe se, And many a wawe þer-yn rysyth row. Wherfore beth at hoom &amp; restyth yow, And I shal goon for us both two Thys holy pylgrymage for to do.’ But not-for-þan, as it is þe guyse Of wummen, she nold hyr purpose lete; Wherfore ful oft in most humble wyse Sore wepyng she fel doun to hys fete, And neuere wold sece tyl he hyr dede hete Wyth hym to goon, &amp; þan ful mery She was, &amp; anoon she hyr maad redy. And as soon aftyr þan as was redy Her shyp &amp; al þat longyd þere-to, In þe gouernaunce of blyssyd Mary Al þat þei haddyn þei dede do; And she þe shuldrys of hem both two Of crystys cros wyth a tokne dede sygne, That þe deuyl hem ageyns shuld not malyngne. And whan þei saylyd had but o day, And in here seyl þe wynde ful blew, Er þei were war a sodeyn affray And a greth tempest up-on hem grew, So þat alle men noon othir knew But þat þai must nedys perysh &amp; dye, And for uery fere þey loude dede crye. And whyl þei were in þis dystresse And wyth tempest possyd to &amp; fro, So greth anguesh cam to þe princesse That chyld she hadde in þat greth wo. And þerwyth þe prince to hyre dede go; And whan he cam, he hyr deed fonde, And þe chyld lying vndyr hyr ryht honde. And anoon þe chylde began to crye, Desyryng to han had sum solaas Of hys modrys pappys, but þo wer drye, For wythowtyn doute she deed was. And whan þe prince sey þis pytous caas, He sorwyd &amp; wepte ful byttyrly, And þerwyth þus cryid ryht pytously: ‘Allas, allas wrecche! what shal I do? A chyld I desyryd, but infortunatly For chyld &amp; modyr lost arn both two. Allas, also, allas! why dye not I?’ And þerwyth þe shypmen gun to cry, ‘Throwe oute þis body in-to þe se, Or ellys by lyklynesse alle perycsh shul we! For þis certeyn we alle wele knowe, Whyl yt here-in ys þe tempest nyl cece.’ And as þei it hent oute for to throwe, The prince a-mong hem anoon dede prece, And seyd, ‘syrys, I beseche you of sum relece; And þow ye ne han mercy on hyr nere me, Yet of þe yung infaunth hath sum pyte. Suffryth, syrys, a whyl for goddys sake, Ne hap þe wumman in ony kothe be, And may returne &amp; geyn lyf take.’ And whyl he þus seyd, he dede se Not fer an hyl, &amp; þan þouht he, ‘Bettyr it is yundyr þem both to graue, Than fysshys to her pray þem shuld haue.’ And not-wythstondyng þat wyth wattry yhe The shypmen he preyid &amp; yaf hem yiftys also, Onneyth þei wolde to hys entent them plye; And whan he þat hyl was comyn on-to, He ful sore laboryd yt for to vndo, Hem to haue beryid aftyr hys entent, But entryn þer myht noon instrument. And whan he sawe þat it wold not be, Hys wyfys deed body he dede down leye Wrappyd in hyr mentyl, vndyr a tre, And on hyr brest þe chyld wyth a wepyng eye; And er he þens dede takyn hys weye, As deuouthly as he coude best deuyse, He knelyd doun &amp; preyid euene þis wyse: ‘O Mary Mawdelyne, to my perdycyoun And to encres of my wrecchydnesse To Marcyle cuntre why dedyst þou com, Me for to puttyn in swych dystresse? Askyd þou of þi goddys goodnesse For þis skyl a chylde on-to my wyf, That þus þei bothe shuld lesyn her lyf? I woot neuere; but þis wot I wele, That she deed is as I now se And so shal þe chyld in ful short seel, For he nowt hath wyth fostryd to be. Nertheless, syth I hym had by the, Lych as I haue doo al my noþir þing, I commytte hem to þine &amp; þi goddys kepyng. And yf he be myhty, as þou dost teche, The modrys soule he haue in hys memory; And thorgh þine preyers I louly beseche, That þe chyld not perysh, shew he mercy.’ And wyth þe mantel hem both he dede wry; And nowht oo wurd more myht he seyn For sorwe, but went to þe shyp ageyn. And aftyr whan he to londe dede come, On hys iourney he fast furth went Seynt Petyr for to sekyn in Rome. And whan Petyr hym sey, he hys entent Of hym dede aske, &amp; what þat ment, Hys merke, &amp; whens he cam &amp; why; And he told Petyr al euene by &amp; by. Whan petyr had herd al þi processe, ‘Pees be to þe,’ he seyd, ‘wyth pacyence. Thow art wolkome, for in sothfastnesse To holsum counsel þou hast [y]oue credence. And be not heuy of þi wyfys absence, Thow she &amp; hyr chyld a whyl do slepe; For god is strong ynow þem both to kepe.’ And aftyr þis, to confermyn hys holy entent Ant to stablysshyn hym in hys new grace, To Ierusalem wyth hym seynt Petyr went; And þere, to encres of hys gostly solace, He hym led &amp; shewyd hym euere place Wher cryst prechyd &amp; suffryd &amp; roos ageyn, And wher of hys dycyplys he was last seyn. And whan he in pylgrymage &amp; in preyer, And in lernyng of þe feyth dylygently, Owt of hys cuntre had be ful two yer, He homward ayen ful deuouthly Hys iourne took; and caswelly To þe hyl he neyhyd wher he dede leye Hys wyf, wych owtward pytously dede deye. And he þe shypmen preyid hertyly, And hem yaf greth yiftys also, To rydyn on ankyr a whyl þer-by, Whyl he þe hyl seyd myht go to, To se what was wyth hys wyf do And wyth hys chylde, &amp; þei folwyd hys wyl, And in a boot hym launchyd on-to þe hyl. And as he toward þe hyl dede go, A lytyl chyld al nakyd rennyng On a clyf he perseyuyd to &amp; fro, On chyldryns wyse besyly pleying, And smal stonys on-to þe see castyng; And as mery he semyd to be &amp; as glad As þow he mo felaas had had. And þis same chyld was certeynly Hys sone, whom by specyal grace Blyssyd Marye Mawdelyn meruelously Had þo two yer fostryd in þat place. And whan þe chyld perseyuyd hys fadrys face, As he þat beforn had neuyr seyn men For feer a-wey he fast dede ren. And streyht þedyr wher hys modyr dede lye, As he was wone to doon he went, And wyth hir mantyl he dede hym wrye, And in hys mowth anoon hyr pappe he hent And began to sowkyn in besy entent. And þe prince, ameruaylde sore of þis caas, Ful fast hym hyid tyl he þere was. And anoon as he þiddyr cam And fond þe chyld lyn &amp; sowkyn, In bothyn hys armys he it up nam, And on hys kneys he dede doun knelyn, And wyth al hys hert to Mary Mawdelyn, And as deuouthly as koude best deuyse, He yaf hyr thankyng on þis wyse: ‘O blyssyd Mary Mawdelyn, Honour, laude &amp; wurshepe to þe, Wych þis two yere þis tendyr chyld myn Hast oonly of þi benygnyte Kept &amp; fostryd in þis wundyr degre! Weel hast þou shewyd, blyssyd lady, her That grace fer passyth naturys power. More-ouyr, blyssyd lady, in no maner Myht I haue, me thynkyth, more felycyte Than þat my wyf wych deed lyith her From deth to lyf myht reuyguryd be, And wyth me returne to my cuntre, Wych þe to moun I haue ful confydence Of my chyldys kepyng by experyence.’ And as he hys preyer þus dede make, Hys wyf anoon began up to ryse, Lych as from slepe she had do wake; And as deuouthly as she koud deuyse To mary Mawdelyn she seyd þis wyse: ‘Greth is þi meryth in goddys syht, O blyssyd lady, &amp; so is eke þi myht. Gramercy, lady, wych me helpyng Where, þorgh þi greth grace &amp; cheryte, In alle þe pressurs of my chyldyng, And my mydwyf eek vouchyddyst-saf to be; And more-ouyr þorgh þi benygnyte In yche nede to me were as redy As euere was handmayde to hyr lady.’ Whanne þe prynce þese wurdys dede here, Grethly abasshyd he made þis cry: ‘Art þou alyue, myn owyn wyf dere?’ ‘Ye, syre, þat I am,’ quod she, ‘suthly, And now fyrst ageyn hedyr comyn am I And haue made an ende of þe vyage Wych þou hast doon, &amp; þe sam pylgrimage. For lych as seynt Petyr lede þe To Ierusalem, &amp; shewyd þe euery place Wher cryst prechyd in oure freelte, Wher he deyid &amp; roos &amp; hens dede pace; So blyssyd Mawdelyn of hir good grace Wyth yow me led &amp; shewyd yche deel, Wych in my mende I prendyd haue weel.’ And anoon to rehersyn she began Hyr husbondys iourne euene by &amp; by, And what þe seyde &amp; where &amp; whan, And faylyd in no poynt substancyally. An þan aftyr to god þankyng hertly To shyp þei went, &amp; wythynne short whyle They meryly applyid on-to Marsyle. And anoon as þei wer comyn to londe And gunne to entryn into here cyte, Wyth hyr dyscyplys Mary þei fonde Prechyng þe peple, as wone was she, And þe prynce &amp; hys wyf wyth greth humylyte Sore wepyng to hir fete doun fel, And al her iourne opynly dede tel. And aftyr þis anoon þei baptysyd were Of blyssyd Maxymyn ful deuouthly, And alle ydols templys wych were þer Þei dystroyid furth-wyth, &amp; dylygently They madyn up cherchys euene by &amp; by, And wyth oon assent þei chosyn to be Blyssyd Lazer bysshop of þat cyte. Whan þis was doon þei went þens, Blyssyd Mawdelyn &amp; hir company, And come to a cyte clepyd Aguens, Wych, wyth myraclys shewyde plenteuously, To cryst was conuertyd ryht redyly, And Maxymyn bysshop of þat cyte maad; Wych doon, blyssyd Mawdelyn was glaad; For from hens-forward hyr hert was set To yeuyn hyr oonly to contemplacyoun, And al þing forsake þat myht hyr let; For wych entent, by an heuenly inspyracyoun, In a wyldyrnesse she took hyr habytacyoun Ordeynyd by aungelys in a bareyn plaas, Wher thretty wyntyr she vnk[n]owyn was. In wych place was growyng no tre, Ner herbe, ner watyr, ner no solace To hyr bodyly counfort in no degre; And þis was oonly to shew þat grace Of oure saueoure so hyre dede enbrace, That he hyr wold in euerych nede Wyth heuenely fode alone do fede. For euery day in þat desolat plaas Seuene sythys in-to þe eyr ful hye Wyth aungelys handys she up lyftyd was, And wyth hyr bodyly eerys heuenely armonye Ther she herd, wyth wych melodye In body &amp; soule she fede was so wele Þat of bodyly food she nedyd no dele. And in þis mene tyme it so befelle That a prest, desyryng to lyue solytaryly, But twelue furlong he made a selle From þat place where dwellyd Mary, And þer he hym ocupyid ful holyly In studye of deuouth contemplacyoun, Whom god þer shewyd þis reuelacyoun: Hym þought he sey wyth hys bodyly yhe Aungels come doun in greth bryhtnesse, And beryn up a body abouyn þe skye, Of melodyous song wyth greth swetnesse; An whan an our or more, as he dede gesse, Thay þer had ben meryly syngyng, To þe seyd place þei it doun dede bryng. And whan þe prest had seyn þis syht, Desyryng to knowyn ful feruently What þing it was, yf it be myht, Purposyd hym to go þe place more ny; But fyrst he prayid god deuouthly Th[a]t in hys iourne he hym wold spede, And to þat place þe ryht wey hym lede. But whan he þus forthward was goon, And to þe place gan to comyn as ny As a man myht haue kast a stoon, Hys leggys to faltryn gunne sodeynly, That he no ferthyr goon myth sothly, But for to return homwerd ageyn Hys leggys wer myhty I-nowe certeyn. And whan he assayid had þus fro &amp; to Dyuers sythys, &amp; it wold not be, Hym þought it was not for to do, Thyddyrward to presyn as in þat degre, For it to knowyn vnworthy was he As hym semyd, wherfore ful hye In þe name of oure sauyour he þus dede crye: ‘I coniure þe by þe uertu pure Of god, þou þat art dwellyng In þat kaue, yf a resonable creature Thou be, let me haue knolechyng What þou art wyth-oute feynyng!’ And þis thryis seyd, Mary ageyn To hym þus answerd in wordys pleyn: ‘Come hedyr more nere, &amp; of euere thyng Wych þi soule desyryth inuereyd to be, Thou shalt han suffycyent certyfying, As mych as it nedyth to be k[n]owyn of þe.’ And anoon ful feerfully furth went he; But vnneth he goon had half þe waye, That þus to hym Mary efthsonys dede saye: ‘Hast þou ony mynd in þe gospel Of oon Marye, most famous synnere, Wych as Luk pleynly doth tel, Crystys feet wysh wyth many a tere, And aftyr hem wypt wyth hir owyn here, And so of hir synnys by goddys grace Plenere indulgence she dede purchace.’ ‘Thys,’ quod þe prest, ‘I haue good mynde, An thretty wyntyr ben passyd &amp; mo, As in holy chyrche we wr[i]ttyn fynde, Syth she mennys cumpany departyd fro.’ ‘I am þat same,’ quod Marye tho, ‘And in þis place her solytaryly Alle þis tym vnknowyn dwellyd haue I. And lych as þou were suffryd to se Yistyrday, ryht cotydyanly Aungelys lyftyn seuene sythys up me, And han doon syth fyrst hedyr cam I. And for now it plesyth oure lordys mercy Me up to take to contynuel b[l]ys, To blyssyd Maxymyn go tel al þis. And moreouyr I wyl þou hym sey also That on esterne day next folwyng, Whan he up rysyth, as he is wone to do, To matynys in þe grey morwenyng, To hys oratorye he go wyth-oute lettyng, Wher by holy aungelys mynystery He me brouht shal fyndyn ful redy.’ And whan þe prest þis voys herd had, Lych þe voys of an aungel clere, Thow he nouht sey yet ful glad He was to ben þe massager Of so holy &amp; of so blyssyd mater, And to Maxymyn he went redyly And dede hys erand euene by &amp; by. Whan Maxymyn herd had al thys Of þe prest, on-to oure saluatour Wyth al þe entent of hys hert I-wys He yaf þankyng, laude &amp; honour; And þe day assygnyd &amp; eek þe our, In his oratory Mary he fonde stondyng Among aungels handys wych hyr þedyr dede bryng. And on þis wyse was hyre stondyng, From þe erth fully two cobytys space Aungelys handys hir up holdyng; And so greth bryhtnesse was in hir face, That esyere yt was þe sonnys compace In þe clerest day to beholdyn &amp; se Than þe bryhtnesse of hyr beute. Maxymyn þis seyng abasshyd was To behold þe bryhtnesse of hyr cher, And anoon to hym she turnyd hyr faas And seyd, ‘fadyr, beth not in dwer; But boldely, fadyr, comyth to me ner. I am your doughtyr; why do ye fle? Wherfore, fadyr, dreedles comyth to me.’ And whan gadyrd was al þe clergy, And þe seyd preste present was þer, Of þe bysshyp she receyuyd crystys body, Out shedyng many a wepyng ter. And euene furth-wyth wyth-owtyn fer Beforn þe auter she hyr down dede leye, And wyth-owte ony peyne she þere dede deye. And whan furth passyd þe soule waas Of þis blyssyd wumman &amp; most holy, A ful redolent odour in þat same plaas Euene forwyth grew sodeynly, Wych seuene dayis aftyr lastyd contunelly, Wher-by many oon of þer sekenesse Were curyd, thorgh meryth of hyr goodnesse. And aftyr þis blyssyd Maxymyn The body ther beryid deuouthly Of þe apostelesse Marye Mawdelyn, Wyth oynement anoyntyng, smellyng swetly. And whan he shuld deyin, euene hyr by He chargyd hys body beryid to be; And so it was wyth greth solemnyte. But long tym aftyr, whan þe yere of grace On seuen hundryd ran &amp; fourty &amp; nyne, Translatyd was from þis seyd place Thys holy apostelesse, Marye Mawdelyn, To vizelyac, &amp; þer leyd in shryne By oon clepyd Gyrard, a lord in burgundye, Wher as men wene she yet doth lye.

What shuld I speke of hyre fortune, Wych was ryht greth; for, as I seyd before, A kyngys doughtyr she was bore, To whom hyr fadyr in hys deying, For he hyr louyd past al thyng, Of werdly good left greth habundaunce; But so wyth grace hyr god dede auaunce, That al þe thyngys she set at noht Wych ben transytorye, for in hyr þouht She hyr purposyd for to purchace The goodys wych neuere awey shul pace, Ner neuere ende, nere neuere mysse, As uertu in erthe, &amp; ioye &amp; blysse Aftyr þis lyf in heuene to leed. For wych entent, in almesse dede She hyre ocupyid &amp; in preying, In hyre fadrys paleys dwellyng. And whan she eyghtene yere was of age, Thys seyd Maxence in hys fers rage Dede make a general proclamacyoun, Chargyng al men to Alysaundy[r] toun, Both pore &amp; ryche, at assygnyd day To comyn, ych in hys best aray, Wher he hym purposyd in solemne wyse To hys goddys to make a sacryfyse, Wyllyng alle men þe same to do; And yf ony þere were þat nolde so But rebellyd ageyns hys seyd entent, He fully ordeynyd þat by iugement He cruelly shuld be brought adawe, As a transgressour of hys lawe And of crystene feyth as a meyntenour. And whan þe tyme come was &amp; þe our That þis sacryfyse shuld be do, Greth confluence of peple cam þer-to, Wyth hem bryngyng, as was þe guyse, Summe beestys, sume foulys to sacryfyse; And sume come wych in here preuy entent To do sacryfyse no þinge ment, For in affeccyoun þei crystene were. And as þei alle were assemblyd þere, Redy to makyn here offryng Anoon at þe comaundement of þe kyng, The trumpettys lowde begun to blowe, Wher-by at ych man myht knowe Whan þai shuld make her offryng. And fyrst of alle began þe kyng, Aftyr þe guyse of þere vsaunce, Wher many a spere &amp; many a launce And many a swerde men myht se drawe, The bestys to sle wych aftyr þe lawe In þere sacryfyse shuld offryd be. And whyl þei were besy in sundry degre To sacryfyse wyth dew dylygence To her goddys plesaunce &amp; reuerence, The noyse of þe bestys &amp; peplys cry, The voys of orgons &amp; of dyuers menstralcy, So swyftly þe eyr dede furth dryue That to katerynys eerys þe sounde cam blyue. And anoon to wetyn what it ment A massager priuyly she þiddyr sent. And when she had lernyd clause by clause Of þis greth noyse what was þe cause, And how it stood, &amp; in what degre, She wyth hyr took of hyre meyne Swych as hyre lyst, &amp; in ful sad wyse Thedyr went wher þei dede sacryfyse. Whedyr whan she kam, she dede aspye Among hem many a wepyng yhe Of swych as priuyly crystyn were, And sacryfysyd oonly of deth for fere; And whan þis sey she was sory, And euene furth-wyth, ful deuoutly Hyr cause comendyng to goddys grace, Wyth crystys cros she merkyd hyr face And eek hyr brest, &amp; wyth sad chere Wher þe emperour was she drow nere, And as he was ocupyid in hys sacryfyse, To hym she seyd euene in þis wyse: ‘The to salusyn, o syre emperour, Wych lord art here &amp; eek gouernour, The dygnyte of þin ordur us shuld compelle, And þe weye of resoun þe same doth telle, Yf þese sacryfysys wych þou doost to These fals goddys þou woldyst do To oo god aboue, wych is creatour Of heuene &amp; of erthe &amp; sool gouernour, And of al ther-yn wych is conteynyd. But þese whom mannys errour hath feynyd To be goddys uery deuelys be, Or deuelys dennys; wherfore ye Wrongfully to hem doon sacryfyse.’ And anoon she began in crafty wyse, Stondyng beforn þe temple gate, By dyuers conclusyons hyr to dylat, And by many sylogysmys &amp; by many an argument She þer dyserthly shewyd hyr entent. And whan she had longe þis wyse do, The emperour hyr wurdys she turnyd to, And seyd, ‘syre emperoure, loo, in þis wyse To þe I haue spokyn as to þe wyse; But nowe I wyl return to comown speche. Telle me þe cause, I the beseche, Why hast þou gadryd þis multytude Thus in veyn of þis peple rude, Of youre goddys to wurshyp þe fonnydnesse? What is þe skyl, telle me expresse, Why þou so wundryst þis temple hye By masouns handys her maad redy, The ornamentys þer-of &amp; eke þe ar[a]y, Wych, be þai neuere so fresh &amp; gay, Yet shul þei rote &amp; a-wey pace As doth dust beforn þe wyndys face? Maruayle rathyr by al resoun Why heuene is up &amp; erthe is doun, And al þe contentys wyth-yn both to, As fysshys &amp; foulys; maruayle also The heuenys orbiculer reuolucyoun From est to west wyth-oute cessacyoun, And why sunne &amp; mone wyth oþir sterrys fyue Contraryous cours geyn al heuene dryue, And han doon from þe werldys begynnyng, And shul to þe ende wythowte secyng, Her offyhs performyng to þat entente That þei wer set fore in þe fyrmament. And whan þou wel hast consyderyd al þis, Vndyrstonde þat oon yet myhtyere is Than al þem, of alle þe creatour, Vnmeuable, &amp; of alle oþir þe motour. And yf þou thurgh grace gun hym aspye, Hym preyse, hym wurshype, hym gloryfye, For he is god alone &amp; noon but he.’ And whan on þis wyse longe had she Hyr dylatyd by many a resoun, And more-ouyr of crystys incarnacyoun Mych thyng dysputyd prudently, The emperour astoynyd was inwardly, And to hyr he seyd on þis wyse: ‘Wumman, lete us our sacryfyse Performyn &amp; endyn as gunne haue we, And þan douthles þou shalt answerd be.’ And anoon forwyth he commaundyd &amp; bad That to hys paleys she shuld be lad, And to be kept wyth good dylygence, For grethly he maruaylyd of hyr prudence In hyr talkyng, &amp; of þe greth beute Wych she hadde in excellent degre, Past alle oþir, as to hys eye, That euere to-forn he had seye. Wherfore he purposyd wyth al hys myht Hyr ageyn to wyn, yf at he myht. And whan þat hys sacryfyse was al do And returnyd hys paleys he was to, He hyr bade be brouht to hys presence, To whom he þus uttryde hys sentence: ‘Damysel, ye knowe in what wyse Thys day, whyl we in oure seruyse Ocupyid were ful deuouthly, To us ye precyde euene opynly, And by maner of an exhortacyoun Ye þere maad a longe peroracyoun, In wych we perceyuyd greth eloquence, And wern eek ameruaylyd of youre prudence. But for-as-myche as oure wyttys applyid Were þat tyme &amp; fully occupyid In excucyoun of oure sacryfyse On-to oure goddys aftyr oure lawys gwyse, We myht not wel takyn your entent, Ner clerly vndyrstond what ye ment. And þerfore home hedyr on-to oure place We you sent, tyl more lengere space And lasere we myth han of talkyng. Wherfore nowe at þe begynnyng, Er we ferþere forth do procede, Fyrst I wyl knowe of your kynrede; And whan þat to me opyn is &amp; clere, Than wyl I spekyn of oþir matere.’ To whom Kateryne wyth ful sad chere An answer yaf in þis manere: ‘Syr, as I fynd wrytyn by a poete, No man shuld hym-self byyete, Ner extollyn hym-self by pompous fame, Nor ouyr mych puttyn hym-self in blame, For so doon folys, quod he, suthly, Wych ben uexyd wyth veyn-glory. Wherefore neythyr I wyl hyde My byrth, ner wyth pompous pride Magnyfyin it more þan yt is. A kyngys doughtyr I was, I-wys, Wych deed is ful longe ago, And but me chyldryn he left no mo; Wherfore hys eyr I am by ryht Of resoun, &amp; kateryne I hycht. But not-wythstondyng þat I was bore In purpyl, &amp; instruct in þe lore Of þe seuene scyencys clepyd liberal, Yet by my kunnyng ryht not at al I set, ner by þe greth honour Of my byrth, wych at þis our Wyth al myn hert I her forsake And set at nouht for crystys sake, Wych is my spouse, my lord, my loue, For whoos sake to suffryn reproue I now am redy &amp; euere shal be, For oþir god is þer noon but he; For he is myhty, wytty, ful of goodnesse, And redy to helpyn at ych dystresse, And kan no wyse hys grace denye To hem in nede wych to hym crye. But alle þo goddys of wych ye yelpe So feble ben þat þai ne helpe May neythyr hem-self ner oþir man. Mych folys, me semyth, be þai þan That puttyn þer trust in swych godheed Wych may not helpyn hem at her need, Ner in trybulacyoun socour sende, Ner from no peryls hem defende.’ ‘Than folwyth yt þus,’ quod þe emperour, ‘That al þe werd erryth at þis our In þe myschef of fals byleue, And kan not to þe treuth acheue, Saf þou alone; wych may not be, For in þe mouth stondyth of two or thre Al wytnesse, as techyn þe wyse, And not in oon aloon, as þou doost deuyse. Wherfor, þowe þou wer an aungel Or an heuenly vertu, and dydyst us tel The contrarye of þat we beleue, We no wyse awte þe to leue.

Wher-fore, syr, beth reulyd by equyte If ye lyst to reioyse yow of lyberte; For, as in a poete ye fynd moun, Who þat is reulyd by resoun And not by hys senswal felyng Hath wurthyly þe name of a kyng; And þer-ageyn who-so ne wyl By resoun be reulyd &amp; by skyl, But folwyth þe lust of senswalyte, Thow he emperour, kyng, or kayser be, He ne may for al hys hy lynage The tytyl auoydyn of seruage. Wherfore, syr, by counsel of me Haboundyth [y]ou in uerteuous lyberte Wych euere conseruyn wyl your honour.’ ‘A, I se rycht wele,’ quod þe emperour, ‘That wyth þi treccherous sotylte Us to snarlyn þou besyist þe, And by exaunnplys of phylosophye To bryngyn us all to þi folye. I aspyid haue alle þine entent.’ And furth-wyth to presoun he hyr sent, There to abydyn hys lasere. And anoon he sent a massagere Wyth lettrys on-to al þe clergye That was wyth-yn hys tyrannye, Chargyng þat alle þe maystrys of gramer And of rethoryk eek, both fer &amp; ner, In as hasty wyse as yt myht be do, The pretory of alysaundyr shuld come to, Wyth a maydyn þer to contende Wych to be whys dede pretende, Of whom yf þai myht han victory Thei rewardyd shuld be wurthyly.

And whan þai come þe emperour before, They askyd cause why &amp; wherfore They aftyr wer sent in so hasty wyse. ‘Syrs,’ quod the emperour, ‘for ye ben wyse, And I of wysdam haue greth myster; For in my courght wyth me her A maydyn I haue wych doth pretende I wyt to passyn alle men lyuende, And despysyth our goddys &amp; hem doth calle Deuelys or deuelys dennys alle, And to enforcyn wyth hyr entent She multyplyith many an argument, And alle þat she seyth, by poysye, By rethoryk or ellys by phylosophye She confermyth ryht marualously. Of whom yf ye kun gete þe vyctory, I shal rewarde you wele for your labour And home ageyn sendyn wyth greth honour.’ Whan þis was seyd, wyth greth dysdeyn Thus oon of hem answerd ageyn: ‘Syr emperoure, saf oonly youre reuerence, Of your counsel þe inaduertence I maruayle grethly, &amp; þat ye wold calle Hedyr from so fer us alle, And specyaly for so smal a mater To wych had suffycyd þe leste scoler Of ony of us, I dar ryht wele seyn.’ To whom þe emperour, þis seyd, ageyn: ‘I knowe wele þat wyth fors of myht Hyr to sacryfyse compellyn I myht, And eke by vyolence of peyne Hyr pompous language I myht restreyn, And puttyn hyr by turment to sylence. But bettyr me semyth is þe sentence That wyth þe wysdam &amp; þe sotylte Of youre argumentys she concludyd be, Euene so opynly th[at] she ne may To be conuyctyd onys seyn nay. And whan ye han doon, þan wyl I Inducyn hyre to oure byleue softly, Or ellys compellyn hyr by torment. Lo, syrs, now knowe ye myn entent. Do ye youre deuer as ye kun &amp; moun.’ And in mene whyle in a dyrk prysoun Kateryne was kept, to whom þe caas Of þis conflycth pleynly told was. And whan she it herd, ful deuouthly Doun she knelyd &amp; to god on hy Comendyd hyr cause in hir mater. And euene furth-wyth þer dede aper An aungel bryht, &amp; bad þat she In ony wyse shuld of good confort be; And told hyr sekyr þat not oonly She þe next [morwe] shuld han victory Of alle þese clerkys, but eek conuerte She shuld hem alle, &amp; þei in herte Ful conuertyd thorgh a specyal grace By martyrdam shuld to heuen blysse pace. And on þe next morwe ryht by tyme The emperour was redy anoon by prime, And set hym on hys sete trybunal, And anoon to-forn hym he dyde furth cal Kateryne, &amp; set hyr on þe to syde, And euene ageyn hyr ful of pryde The fyfty oratours he dede sete. And whan kateryne þis sey, wyth-oute lete On-to þe emperour she þus dede seye: ‘By what resoun ys þis doon, I preye, That ageynys oo maydyn tendyr &amp; ying Fyfty greth clerkys þou doost furth bryng?

And whan þe emperour of hem took kepe, And how þei dowm were, in hys fers rage To hem he vttryd þis language: ‘O ye lewyd knauys, what eylyth yow? Wher is your pompous phylosophye now?

Amen mercy Ihesu &amp; gramercy. The prologe of seynt Agas lyf. As y fynd wrytyn in legend aurea, On fyue wysys may þis wurd ‘Agatha’ Ben expounnyd; and fyrst of ‘Agyos’, Wych sygnyfyith ‘holy’, &amp; of ‘Theos’, That ‘god’ toknyth; þanne in wurdys pleyne ‘Goddys holy’ ys Agas for to seyne. And þis to hyr acordyth by congruyte, For to goddys holy longyn thyngys thre, As seyth Ioon wyth þe golden mouth, Wych to blyssyd Agas were kyd &amp; kouth, As clennesse of herte, &amp; eek presence Of þe holy goost; þe thrydde ys affluence Of werkys good. anoþir wyse, As seyd Ianuence doth deuyse Pertynently to oure purpos, ‘Agatha’ ys seyd of ‘Agyos’, ‘A’, ‘wyth-owte’, ‘geos’ ‘erthe’ ys; Wher-of þe vndyrstondyng ys þis: That Agas in hyr inward entencyoun Uoyd was of al erdely affeccyoun. Or of ‘aga’, wych ‘spekyng’, And ‘Thau’, wych betoknyth ‘endyng’, Thys wurd ‘Agatha’ seyd ys, quod he; And wurthyly, for pleynly she Fyrst &amp; last in hyr spekeyng Perfyht was, as shewyth hyr answeryng. Of ‘agad’, to oure purpoos also, ‘Seruage’ toknyth, &amp; of ‘Theos’ þer-to, Wych sygnyfyith ‘souereyn’, ys deryuyid Thys wurd ‘agatha’, &amp; to þat applyid, That she seyde souereyn ba[r]nage Prouyd ys in crystys trewe seruage. The fyte &amp; þe last deryuacyoun, Aftyr þis clerkys determynacyoun, Of þis oftyn seyd name ‘Agatha’, Is eftsonys of þis wurd ‘aga’ Wych ‘solemne’ ys by interpretacyoun, And of ‘thav’, wych toknyth ‘consummacyoun’; And þis to Agas longyth congruently, For consummat she was ful solemnely Of holy aungels by þe sepulture. Now, blyssyd Agas, do þi besy cure That þei wych louyn &amp; wurshepyn þe, Goddys holy, in þis werd mow be Endewyd of herte wyth clennesse, And of good werkys wyth plenteuousnesse, Pure from al erdly affeccyoun, And to haue in speche swych perfeccyoun That alle here wurdys mow sow[n]de uertu; So eek in þe seruyse of cryst Ihesu To been excercysyd in þis werde here, That, whan þere bodyis ben leyd on bere, Here soulys wyth aungelys led mow be To þat place of endlees felycyte Where þou doost dwelle; &amp; specyally To Agas Fleg attende, o blyssyd lady; And hyr to purchase help swych grace, Owt of þis werd or she do pace, That she may haue deu contrycyoun Of olle hyre mys, &amp; plener confessyoun, Space &amp; leyser a seeth to make, And þe holy sacrament to take Of crystys body, &amp; wyth so holy entente That þe deuyl wyth noon enpechemente Hyre mow lette from þe souereyn blys, Where ioye &amp; merthe endlees ys, Whedyr mot brynge both hyr &amp; us Thorgh thy merytys, oure lord Ihesus. [Two blank lines.] Here begynnys the lyf of seynt Agas. Agas, of whom I haue spoke [b]eforn, In an yle Cycyle clepyd was born, And of Cathanence in þe royal cyte. Of þe nobyllest blood eek of þat cuntre Lyneally succedyng she dede descende, Aftyr þe sentence of þe golden legende; But no scryptur I fynd þat kan descrye Of here kynrede þe lyne, ner hyre genealegye Declaryn, nere hyr progenytours pedegre, Nere what hyr fadrys name myht be Nere hyre modrys, treuly; but þis I fynde, That wyth þe yiftys both of grace &amp; kynde She endewyd was most excellently. But not-wythstondyng þat in body And soule eek she had greth excellence Of beute; yet euere hyre dylygence God to seruyn she dede in al holynesse, Both daye &amp; nyht wyth greth besynesse; For pryuyly in hyre inward thouht Rychesse &amp; welth she set at nouht, Alle fleshly lustys she dede despyse, No werdly wurshepe myht hyr supprise Nere fro goddys loue changyn hyr entent. I wych mene tyme from Rome was [oon] sent Of al þat cuntre þe reule to han, And clepyd was hys name Quyncyan, And to ocupyin þe offyce of consularye; Lowe of byrth, by fortune set hye Up-on hyre whele, wych ay vnstable And vertyble ys &amp; ful mutable, Neuyr stondyng styl but euere turnyng, As of þis Quyncyan shewyd þe endyng, As at þe ende of þis legende They here shul wych lyst attende. And not oonly ygnoble was þis Quyncyan, But he eek was a ful vycyous man, And specyally he was lybydynous Thorgh fleshly lust, &amp; þere-to coueytous, Fals of byleue &amp; an ydolatour, Wych to mammettys doth godly honour, And uery god in heuene doth denye. But whan þis Quyncyan dede aspye Here is agas delyueryd to Affrodyse. The purpose of Agas in hyr entent, By hys offycers for hyr he sent, And delueryd hyr tyl oon Affrodyse, A wumman wych lyuyd in synful wyse, Hyr body offryng to þe vnclennesse Of ych þat cam, and of lyk wykkydnesse Wyth hyr she had doughtrys nyne; Whom he chargyd þat wyth sum gyne They shuld alle doo al her kunnyng, Both by behestys &amp; by thretyng, Of thretty dayis wyth-yn þe space, To remeue Agas from goddys grace And enclynyn hyr herte to ydolatrye. And þei anoon them dede applye To that purpoos, but yt nold not be. ‘For thys I wyl ye knowe,’ quod she, ‘That myn herte on swych a stoon ys groundyd, And yn cryst ihesu so steedfastly foundyd And byldyd up in swych degre That alle youre wurdys, wych as wynd be, Youre thretys as flodys, youre hestys as reyn, As to me ben both frustrate &amp; veyn. For þow ye neuere so sore assayle My fundacyoun, ye not preuayle Shul mown þer-geyns, ner vndyr you alle Shul þe byldyng maak doun to falle.’ Thus oftyn wepyng she dede seye, And wyth deuouth herte she god dede preye That he vouchydsaf hyr make For hys loue deth for to take, And so to entryn in-to that blys Where ioy &amp; myrth endles ys. And whan Affrody seye þe stedefastnesse Of blyssyd Agas, &amp; þe goodnesse From wych she nold remeuyd be, Here Affrodyse delyueryth Agas ageyn to Quyncyan. To Quyncyan she seyd on þis degre: ‘Syre, as fer-forth as I kan aspye, Esyere yt ys stonys to mollyfye And to makyn as soft as ys lyht brede, And brennyng yryn to þe softnesse of lede, Than yt ys þis tendyr maydyns herte Fro þe entent of crystene feyth conuerte, Wych both impossyble semyng to be.’ And anoon Quyncyan comaundyd þat she Shuld be brouht to hys presence; And whan she come was, he hys sentence Vttryd þus: ‘damysel, anoon sey me Of what kynrede born ye be.’ Quod Agas: ‘I sey yt for no pompousnesse, A ientylwumman I am, as bern wytnesse Al my parentele ryht wele kan.’ ‘If þou þan,’ quod he, ‘be a ientyl wumman, A serual persone why shewyst the In maners &amp; condycyouns for to be?’ ‘For I am,’ quod she, ‘crystys handmayde; Therefore to shewe me I ne am dysmayde A seruyle persone for crystys sake.’ ‘Than to þis questyoun a sieth þou make,’ Quod Quyncyan; ‘syth þou ientyl art &amp; fre Of byrth, [an] handmayde hou mayst þou be? For by al resoun, as I do gesse, Ful contrarye ben seruage &amp; ientylnesse, And to-gedyr no wys may be combynyd.’ ‘I-wys,’ quod agas, ‘yf þou were illumynyd Of heuenely grace wyth þe influence, Thou sone shuldyst chaungyn [þ]is sentence And yn þine inwarde conseytys sone aspye That crystys seruage ys grettest genterye, And most souereyn fredam &amp; lyberte Is in hys seruyse prouyd to be; Whom to seruyn ys a kyngys offyhs.’ ‘Ya, leue al þis talkyng,’ quod he, ‘unwyhs! And of two thyngys anoon do chese: That ys to seyn, whethyr þou wylt lese Thy lyf of peyn wyth greth vyolence, Or ellys louly to offryn frankensence, Deuoutly knelyng up-on þi kne, On-to oure goddys, wych immortal be And al thyng weldyn in her subieccyoun.’ ‘I-wys,’ quod she, ‘syth so hy renoun Is in youre goddys, as þou doost expresse, I wold to Venus youre goddesse Thy wyf were lyk &amp; þou to Ioue Thy god, whom to syttyn aboue Thow feynyst othyr goddys alle, And syngulerly for helpe to hym doost calle And in ych myschef for socour dost seke.’ And anoon a buffet vndyr þe cheke He comaundyd hyr haue, seying þis wyse: ‘In-to þe iniurye of þi justyse Be not presumpteuous þi mouth to vndo, But kepe þi tonge, wyhsdam wyl so, And iape me not, I the counsayle.’ ‘Sykyrly,’ quod Agas, ‘I grethly meruayle That þou, wych holdyst þi-self so wyhs, So fonnyd art wexyn &amp; so nyhs, And so fer forth led in errour That swych goddys þou doost honour And wyrshepyst wyth greth solemnyte, To whom comparyd for to be And to be assemelyd to as in lyf Neythyr þe þou deynyst ner þi wyf, But thynkyst iniurye to you &amp; wroung That I desyre you to lyue long Wyth your goddys in egal degre; For yf þei very perfyht goddys be, Uoyde of al malyhs &amp; of yre, [I] to you but good no thyng desyre; And efthsonys, on þat oþir syde, If from here lyf thou þe dyuyde, Dysdeynyng her lyknesse of entente, Thanne to my purpoos þou doost assente, And as lytyl apprysyst hem as do y.’ Quod Quyncyan, ‘why art þou so besy Wyth veyn cours of wordys slye And cautelous me for to ludyfye, And to prolonge þe tym in sotyl wyse? Shortly I sey, but þou sacryfyse Do to oure goddys in humble manere Here opynly &amp; wyth hert entere, Swych torment to þe I shal applye That for uery peyn þou shalt dye, And so lesyn al werdly solas.’ To whom demurely þus seyd agas: ‘Ful lytyl I charge hou þou me threte; For thowe wyld bestys þou behete To me to sende, whan crystys name They onys here they shul waxe tame; And thowe þou threte me by feer, Yet chaunge no wyse I wyl my chere, For þe dew of heelful saluacyoun Aungelys from heuene shul bryng me doun; And þow þou torment &amp; woundys me threte And wyth yerdys &amp; scourgys to be bete, Yet of þe holy gost counfort to haue I hope weel swych as schal me saue, And so strong make in sundry wyse That, what-so-euere þou kanst deuyse Of peyn &amp; of cruel torment, Thorgh hys grace of hool entent I hem alle despyse wyth herte entere.’ And he anoon wyth a sturdy chere Chargyd hyre on-to prysoun be lad, For she hym vttyrly confoundyd had Aforn alle folk euene opynly. Whedyr Agas went as myryly And as gladly as þow þat she To a feste royal led had be. And as she þedyr went &amp; eek there, Lych as Ianuence us dooth lere. In hys book clepyd golden legende, Wyth deuouth preyer she dede comende To god hyr cause ful humbylly. And Quyncyan, þe next morwe erly, Agas beforn hym comaundyd apere, To whom he seyd on þis manere: ‘Agas, I counsel þe for þi prowe, Cryst for þi god forsake thowe Euene here in opyn audyence, And to my goddys offre wyth reuerence, Deuouthly on þi kne knelyng.’ But Agas ne wolde for no thyng Neythyr cryst for hyr god forsake Ner to hys goddys sacryfyse make. Wherfore anoon hyr comaundyd he Vp-on a iebet hangyd to be, And there-to be betyn ful cruelly. And she þus hym seyde demurely: ‘I in þis peynys haue swych lykyng As he þat heryth a newe glad tydyng, Or as he þat seth &amp; doth vndyrfounge Hym whom to seen he desyryd hath longe, Or as he þat depe hyd in grounde A precyous tresour hath neuly founde Wych neuere to-forn he had seyn. For þis I wyl þou knowe certeyn, That, lych as þe nobyl greyn whete, Tyl yt be weel trosshyn &amp; bete And from þe chaf be partyd so clene That no fylth þer-in be sene, It ne shal be put in-to þe garnere Of þe lord; &amp; so in lych manere May not my soule, depuryd from vyce Entryn yn of gloryous paradyce By palme of martyrdam to þe place But þou my body do al to-race Wyth þi tormentours ful dylygently. Spare not ther-fore, for I am redy To suffre what-euere þou lyst to do.’ Quod Quyncyan þan, ‘anoon, go to, O tormentours, &amp; to þis damysel ying Sumwhat shewyth of youre kunnyng. Touchyth hyr a lytyl from þe herte Vp-on hyr pappys &amp; doth hyr smerte, And let hyre knowyn what ys peyn.’ And þei anoon hyre gunne to streyn; Sum wyth pynsouns blunt &amp; dulle Hyr tendyr brestys begunne to pulle Ful boystously; summe in here hondys Browhtyyn brennyng hoot fyr-brondys, And therwyth hyr pappys al to-brent; Sum wyth yirnene forkys out rent The flesh þer-of, that grete pyte How þe blood owt ran yt was to se On euery syde ful plenteuously. And whan þis was doon, he gan to cry And chargyd hys tormentours in al hast Hem of to kutten &amp; way to kaste Wyth-oute pyte or reuthe, allas! Al þat he bad performyd yt was, And whan a-wey was kut both flesh &amp; fel, Agas þus seyd: ‘o wrecchyd &amp; cruel And cursyd tyraunth, hast þou no shame A-wey to kuttyn that on thy dame Thou dedyst soukyn for þi fostryng Ere þou koudyst etyn, whyl þou were ying And ere þou wyt haddyst or dyscresyoun? Where-fore me semyth greth confusyoun It awt to be to euery man Thus to dysfyguryn a wumman As þou hast me in þi fersnesse. But not-wythstondyng al þi cruelnesse, Maugre al þi furyous vyolence, Thorgh help of heuenely influence In my soule al hool wyth-ynne Pappys I haue wych fro me tuynne Thou neuere shalt moun wyth no peyne, Where-wytht I fostre &amp; susteyne Al my wyttys ful dylygently, Wych to my lord god halwyd haue y From þe begynnyng of my tendyr age.’ And þis seyd, Quyncyan in hys fers rage To prysoun chargyd hyre to be lad Wyth-owte lettyng, &amp; eek forbad That no leche shuld entryn hyre to; Mete &amp; drynk he chargyd also No man so hardy hyr to brynge, To enfamyne hyre fully purposynge In hys malyncoly &amp; in hys yre. But god, wych of heuene ys lord &amp; syre And al thyng weldyth at hys wylle, Wold not suffren hym for to spylle Hys seruaunth wyth so cruel iugement; Wherfore to hyre in prysoun he sent A ould man a-boute mydnyht, Here comyth seynt Petyr to Agas in prysoun. Beforn whom went a chyld wyth lyht. Thys old man sempt a leche to be, And dyuers medycyns wyth hym broht he Wych were both good &amp; sure And suffycyent hyr woundys for to cure. And whan he cam euene þere she was, To hyre he seyd þus: ‘o mayde Agas, Al-be-yt so þat þis mad man, Thys consularye, þis Quyncyan, Wyt torment hath þe doon greth dere, Yet hast þou hym wyth þine answere Tormentyd more þan he hath þe; For in hys conscyence ful confuse ys he, And, as yt semyth, at hys wyttys ende. But for I present was whan he dede rende From þi brest þi pappys cruelly Wyth-oute eythyr pyte or mercy, I consyderyd haue by my kunnyng That wyth good dylygence &amp; entendyng They mounn wele be recuryd ageyn And maad al hool, yf þou wylt, certeyn. And comyn I am to þe same entent, And wyth me brouht many an oynement Wych be both good &amp; profytable, And to cure ych soor good &amp; able; And ellys I nolde haue come now here.’ Quod Agal ageyn wyth ful sad chere: ‘Syre, treuly I wyl ye knowe þat y Dede neuere yet medycyn to my body Syth I was born, wherfore now shame To begynne yt were &amp; wurthy blame.’ ‘Doughtyr, I am a crystyn man,’ quod he, ‘And þerfore þou nedyst not to be shamyd of me.’ ‘Nay, nay, syre,’ quod Agas, ‘certeynly No thhyng a-shamyd of you am y, Ner aferd, for syth fer stopyn in age Ye been, as semyth by your vysage, And, on þat oþir syde, wyth greth torment So woundyd I am &amp; so al to-rent, That on no wyse, as yt semyth be me, No man of lust myht tempyd be; Wherfore, fadyr, ryht humbylly I you thank &amp; sey gramercy That ye of your cherytabylnesse Vouchesaf to do swych besynesse Me to curyn wyth greth dylygence; But yt shal not be, wherfore goth hence.’ ‘And what ys cause, I you beseche,’ quod he, ‘That you to coryn ye nyl [s]uffryn me?’ ‘I-wys, syre,’ quod she, ‘for ful of uertu A lord I haue, clepyd cryst Ihesu, Wych of swych myht ys &amp; of puyssaunce That wyth o wurde al my greuaunce He curyn may and euere sore, And perfyth helth to me restore. Therfore, yf he wyl, yt shal be do.’ ‘And þis same lord sent me þe to,’ Quod þis elder, softly smylyng, ‘And hys apostyl I am wythowte doutyng, In whos name, I dar wele expresse, Dylyueryd þou art from al dystresse, And eek alle þi woundys ful curyd be.’ And þis seyd, sodeynly vanysshyd he And no more was seyn in þat plas. Ianuence seyth þat seynt Petyr yt was. And anoon wyth a deuouth entencyoun On bothen hyr knees Agas fel doun, And thankyd god wyth deu mekenesse Of alle hys greth grace &amp; hys goodnesse, For alle hyr woundys both mest &amp; lest Ful curyd were, &amp; to hyre breest Hyr pappys restoryd meruelously At Petrys partyng euene sudeynly. And wyth þe bryhtnesse þat þere was In þe prysoun, whan curyd was Agas Of seynt Petyr, so astoynyd were Hyre kepers alle &amp; so ful of fere, That from hyre they went anoon And þe dorys lefth opyn euerychon Of þe prysoun, &amp; fast gunne fle. Quod oon to hyr þan: ‘o mayde fre, Syth alle þi kepers ben flad awaye, Goth wher you lyst, I yow praye, For euery dore ope stond ful wyde. Wherfore why lenger ye here abyde?’ Quod Agas, ‘woldyst þou [I] shulde fleen hens And so lesyn þe froyht of perfyht pacyens? God forbede, for not oonly so It shulde befalle, but eek þer-to I shulde be cause thorgh my cowardnesse That my kepers shulde been in dystresse And grethly damagyd for lesyng of me. It shal not be so, for I wyl not fle, But pleynly what-euere of me betyde Stylle in þis prysoun I wyl abyde, As long as yt lykyth my lord, my loue, Cryst Ihesu, wych in heuene aboue Lyuyth &amp; regnyth of myhtys most Wyth hys fadyr &amp; wyth þe holy gost, And euere hath doon &amp; shal doon ay.’ But sone, euene aftyr þe fourte day, For Agas out of prysoun sent Quyncyan, and þus hys entent To hyr he seyde: ‘oon of þese two Chese anoon whethyr þou wylt do: That ys to seyn, or in humble wyse To oure goddys þou shalt sacryfyse Beforn alle folk here opynly, Or ellys wyth more cruel tormentry Than þou hast suffryd be maad to dye.’ ‘Thy wurdys,’ quod Agas, ‘been ful of folye, Wykkyd, froward, &amp; ful of uanyte, The eyr defoulyng in sundry degre.

Wherefore, þow þou for þi cruelheed Make by force þe integryte Of my body to be reft fro me, Yet shal I þer-to neuere assent In soule; wherfore, what-euere torment Thou to me lyst of þi tyranny Applyin, to suffryn I am redy. Why taryist so long? anoon begyn, Thou sone of þe deuyl, &amp; euery gyn Of peyne wych þou kanst deuyse Spare not in me to excersyse, For I wyl þou knowe I þe not fere.’ Whan Paschasye herd þis answere, Anoon to hys presence he dede calle Of þe cyte þe Ruffyens alle; Wych been men þat synfullye Wummen ben customyd to selle &amp; bye, And to settyn hem to fer[m]e at þe bordelhous, Ther to gete wyth her craft vycyous Her lyuyng &amp; her maystrys þer-to, Greth peyne to suffre lesse þei so do. And whan þei were comm to þe presence Of Paschasye, þus he hys sentence To hem shewyd: ‘syrs, I you charge, When ye þis damysel han forth at large, Whom I iuge comoun wumman to be, Makyth proclamacyoun þorgh þe cyte, That to þe bordelhous come who-so wyl Wyth hyr þe lust for to fulfyl Of hys flessh at hys owe lykyng; And doth hem to wet þat she ys ying, Lusty &amp; feyr, &amp; a maydyn also, And men þe gladlyer shal precyn hyr to. And so long hyr letyth ben excercysyd Lych to you as I haue deuysyd Tyl she be deed for werynesse.’ And anoon furth-wyth þe gunne hem dresse Hyr furth to lede, as Paschasye bad; But wyth al þe myht at þei had, Wyth so greth wyhte þe holy gost Hyr had fyxyd, þat lest &amp; most Styryn h[ir] ne myht ner remeue, Wych Paschasys hert sore dede greue. And anoon he comaundyd al þe men Wych aboutyn hym stood þedyr to ren And help to drawe, but yt wold not be.

And whan al hys craft he saw fayle, ‘Lucye,’ he seyd, ‘I þe beseche, What be þi wycchecraftys do us teche!’ ‘I wyl þou knowe, Pascasye,’ quod she, ‘That wycchecrafth þer ys noon in me.

And whan Lucye hym stondyn þus saw musyng, She dede þus crye: ‘o wrecchyd Pascaas, Why art þou so tormentyd in þis caas, Wych ynne þi-self wyth malycyusnesse So grethly doth þine herte oppresse?

What made hyr to haue so greth pacyence In suffraunce of trouble &amp; of aduersyte, And þat she neuere wolde m[ak]e no resystence, But ful hope of god rewardyd to be? Wych seyth in þe gospel on þis degre: They shuld be blyssyd wych for ryhtwysnesse Mekely trybulacyouns suffryn &amp; dystresse. That she had cheryte ys eth to knowe, Syth cheryte includyth loue &amp; eke pyte, Of god &amp; our neybours both hy &amp; lowe. I trowe þan þat moor had neuere noon þan she, As who-so abyde tyl hyr lyf red be Shal þereof heren meche experyence. Lo, þus þes thre vertuhs she had by excellence! More-ouyr Elyzabeth on þe secunde wyse Is as mych to seyn as ‘goddys seuent[e] day’; Wych, as myne auctor pleynly doth deuyse, To oure Elyzabeth weel applyid be may, For in þe seuene werkys of pyte she hyr ocupyid ay Or for now in seuente day of soulys rest she ys, Abydyng þe octaue of body &amp; soule in blys. Or by þis nounbyr of seuene, who-so take hede, Seuene statys wych she was yn vnderstonde be moun: As maydenhede, maryage, &amp; also wydewede, Actyf &amp; contemplatyf, þe relygyoun; The seuente, where she now dwellyth, ys heuenly regyoun; And so þe Wurd to danyel seyd affermyd of hyr may be: That seuene tymys han chaungyd up-on the. The threde interpretacyoun, as I seyde be-fore, Of þis name Elyzabeth ys ‘goddys fulsumnesse’, And sygnyfyith þe ioye wych for euyrmore Elyzabeth ys entryd thorgh goddys goodnesse; Of wych ioye kyng dauyd þus seyde expresse: ‘I, lord, wyth þi fulsumnesse sacyat shal be Thanne whanne þi ioye shal appere to me.’ Now, blyssyd Elyzabeth, for þi cherytabylnesse, Helpe us alle to comyn to þat blysful place Where þou art in ioye wych neuer shal lesse, And euere beholdyst god in hys gloryous face; And syngulerly helpe, þorgh þi specyal grace, I the beseche, to dwelle wyth the there Aftyr þis outlaury, dame Elyzabeth ver.[Three blank lines.] AmeN. Thys blyssyd Elyzabeth, as I seyde before, The kyngys doughtyr was of vngarye, Noble of byrthe, but of relygyous lore More nobyl, for she dede magnyfye Alle hyr kynrede &amp; eek gloryfy Wyth manye exaunplys of perfyhtnesse, And wyth myraclys bryhter þan þe skye Enbelshyd yt by þe grace of hyr holynesse. No wundyr, for of kende þe souereyn auctoure Abouyn al natur hyr extollyd ful hye, Whan she, þat was of beute floure And fostryd up wyth kyngly delycacye Wyt many anothyr of hyr allye, Alle chyldly thyngys dede despyse, Or ellys them treuly she dede applye Wyth al hyr dylygence to goddys seruyse. In wyche maner werkys men se moun Hyr tendyr youthe wyth what sympylnesse Began fyrst, &amp; wyth what deuocyoun From day to day she dede hyr besynesse In studijs to ben ocupyid of goodnesse. Veyn pleyis to despyse was hyr dylygence, The fauoure to fleen of fortunys fykylnesse, And eueremore to perfytyn in goddys reuerence. For whan she fyue yere was of age Or ellys lesse, as þe legende doth seye, So deuouth to god was hyr corage That to cherche she oft wold go to preye, And whan she there was, hyr to getyn aweye, To seruyn god so desyrous was she, Hy[r] compers &amp; hyr maydyns for to pleye Anethe myht wythoute greth dyffyculte. Yet whan to pleyn aftyr chyldryns guyse Wyth hyr pleyfers brouht was she, And yche othyr chasyd in dyuerse wyse, Euer to chercheward she dede fle, Sekyng therby an oportunyte To entryn; yn whan she come was, God worchepyng she fel doun on hyr kne, Or ellys in þe pawment up-on hyr faas. And thou she of lettrure no kunnyng had, Yet ful oftyn-tyme she wold vse To han a sauter opyn beforn hyr sprad, Where-in she made hyr for to muse, And long yt was or she hyt wold refuse, As thow she had red euen by &amp; by, Sekyng a colour hyr so to excuse Not to [be] led oute þens to hastyly. Also ful oftyn in hyr pleying Prostrate to ground she fel doun Vp-on hyr face, hyr-self mesuryng As þe pley askyd, but hyr intencyoun Was þerby to han an occasyoun Vndyr colour of pley so couertly To worshepyn god wyth deuocyoun, Whom in herte [she] louyd souereynly. She usyd also a ful noble custum That yf she owt wunne by pleying, Were yt more or lesse, þat al &amp; summe To oþir smale maydyns pore &amp; ying She yaf it anoon, þem exhortying Her pater noster often forto seye, And oure lady to salusyn wyth gabrielis gretyng; And þus shem inducyd for to kun prey. Thus, as by processe of yerys she dede growe, She encrecyd by the effect of deuocyoun; And for in no wyse she wolde ben ouyrthrowe By sleythe of þe deuyl or of hys suggestyoun, She put hyr in oure ladyis proteccyoun, Hyr mekely besechyng hyr aduocate to be; And seynt Ioon þe ewangelyst by specyal affeccyoun She ches to be kepere of hyr uirgynyte. For wyche entent, on seynt valentynys day, Whan of sundry apostlys, aftyr vse of þat cuntre, Vp-on sundry taprys, wych on þe auter lay, Wrytyn sundry namys vsyd were to be, And yche mayde tooke oon aftyr þe casuelte, Thryis tooke euenly Elyzabeth aloon Aftyr þe desyre in hyr hert secre The tapyr wych intytlyd was to seynt Ioon. Aftyr wych tyme in hyr affeccyoun Thys blyssyd apostyl she set so hye That who-so askyd hyr ony petycyoun In hys name, she ne koude yt denye. And þat no successyon shuld hyr ludyfye Of werdly prosperyte, she dayly dede vse, As ner as she koude ony about hyr spye, Sum thyng prosperous from hyr to refuse. Wherfore in pleying whan she sey succede Myrthe &amp; wantounnesse, aftyr chyldyrns guyse, Sodeynly she secyd &amp; wold no more procede, Seying to hyr pleyfers sadly in þis wyse: ‘Oon song is ynow, as I you deuyse; Wherfore for goddys sake wyl we vs restreyne From a-noþir soung.’ &amp; þus be wurdys wyse Hyr handmaydyns from vanyte she vsyd to restreyne. As of hyr outward port what shuld I more seyn But þat in al hyr aray she louyd honeste, And of nyce garnementys skorn had &amp; dysdeyn? Also certeyn vrysouns vsyd yche day she, Wych for ony occupacyouns yf happyd lefth to be, Thow she by hem at euyn wych dedyn hyr kepe Constreynyd were to bedde, yet in no degre Tyl hyr stent were seruyd she ne wolde slepe. Solemne festys þis maydyn eek ful of grace Euere kepte wyth swych deuocyoun That no-bodi hyr sleuys to lace She suffren wolde tyl mes was doon; Ne glouys on þe sunday tyl yt was noon, Wer yt neuere so coulde, vsyn nold she, In þat to satysfyen hyr deuocyoun And for þe reuerence of þe dominycal solemnyte. And þat she shulde of swyche syngulartes Wych þat she louyd &amp; had in vsage, No wyse be lettyd, up-on hyr knees Ful oft knelyng wyth deuouth corage Auowyd þat neuere, for no language Of man nere wumman, neythir greth ne smal, From þese cerymonyis she shulde outrage Tyl dethe of hyr lyf vndyrmynde þe wal. Dyuyne seruyse also wyth swych reuerence She herd, þat whan þe gospel shulde be Red, &amp; in þe sacramentis presens Of crystys body, euere ryht up stude she, Wyth sleuys vnlacyd, &amp; hy[r] nowchys perde She put a-syde, &amp; eek al othyr gere Wych to hyr hede longyde in ony degre On hyr shuldyr þat tyme she vsyd to bere. And whan þis body innocent þus prudently Had reulyd þe tyme of hyr virgynyte, And by cours of yerys successyfly Atteynyd þe state of wummans degre, By hyr [fadyr] constreynyd to entryn was she The state wych longyth to weddit men, Wych stant in þe feyth of the trynyte Wyth kepyng of goddys preceptis ten. To þe wych astate thow she sothly Loth were, yet she assentyd þer-to, Neythyr for lust nere lykynge of hir body, But hyr fadrys wyl for she wold do, And in þat astate þat she myht also Educatyn, yf hyr fruht god dede sende, Them to hys seruyse; þis meuyd hir, lo, To þis conclusyoun to condescende. But yet er she to þe lawe was bounde Of maryage, stondyng in hyr lyberte, Shewyng þat no lust of flessh founde In no maner wyse in hyr myht be, In a maystrys hande wyth humylyte She a vow made: yf for to sterue Yt happyd hyr husbonde er than she, Perpetuel continence þat she shulde obserue. Thus weddyd was to Langrauye, of Turyngye The prynce, þis Elyzabeth, of contynence The uery myrour, ful solemnelye, As askyd þe stat of þer magnyfycence, As ordeynyd hadde goddys prouydence, That to hys loue she many shuld brynge Both greth &amp; smale, &amp; throgh hyr prudence Hem god to seruyn she shuld yeuyn techynge. Wherfore, althow hyr estate dede chaunge Thys blyssyd Elyzabeth, by hyr fadrys decre, To swych as to hyre was ful straunge, I mene to matrymony from uirgynyte, Yet not-for-þan in hyr hert secre Hyr affeccyoun wyth-owtyn chaungabylnesse Was more leef a maydyn to haue be Than princesse or quene or emperesse. But of [how] greth deuocyoun &amp; eek reuerence To godward she was &amp; of what mekenesse And efthsonys of how greth abstynence She was to hyr-self, &amp; of what largenesse And pyte to þe pore, &amp; what tendyrnesse Of seke men she hadde, &amp; how men in care To counforte &amp; chere she dede hyr besynesse, The processys folwynge shul c[l]erely declare. To speke fyrst of preyer: of swych feruoure She was þat hyr madynnys she dede preuente In goyng to cherche ful many an oure Or more, where þe tyme she spente So deuouthly &amp; wyth so holy entente, That yt semyd she purposyd to purchace Of hym þat from heuyn al goodnesse sente Wyth hyr pryuate preers sum newe grace. And not oonly in cherche þis was hyr guyse To preyen, but eek yche nyht also Ful oft tymys she dede up ryse Out of hyr bed þe same to do, There abydyng an our or two In swyche preyers as hyr thoute best; Yet hyr husbonde ful oftyn hyr preyid, lo, To sparyn hyr body &amp; hyt yeuyn sum rest. And for þis custome she wold wele kepe And in no wyse hyr-self þerfro restreyne, If hyt hyr happyd ony tyme to slepe Past hyr custom, she dede ordeyne Oon of hyr maydyns, wych was certeyne Most famylyare hyr wyth, hyr for to take By þe bare foot &amp; hyr soor to streyne Therby tyl she of hyr slepe dede wake. And so yt fel þat onys on a nyht Thys damysel, as she was wone, priuyly To þe bed cam wyth-outyn ony lyht, And by þe foot she shoke vnwarely The pryince, &amp; he woke sodeynly; And whan of þe cause he had informacyoun, He hyt foryaf, &amp; ful prudently Euere þer-of made dyssymulacyoun. So þus, by suffraunce of þis good man, Conformabylly yche nyght dede ryse Thys blyssyd Elyzabeth, þis holy wumman, As ye me han herde beforn deuyse. But þat þe acceptabyllere þe sacryfyse Of hyr preyers to god myht alwey be, Them to wattryn in plenteuous wyse Wyth wepyng eyne ful oftyn oysyd she. And not-wythstondyng þe greth wepyng Wych she dede vsyn in capyousnesse, In hyr chere apperyd no dyffyguryng By hyr terys, but rather gladnesse; And so who hyr sey myht ueryly gesse That ioye &amp; sorue in hyr had swych a temperaunce, That þow she outward shewyd trystesse Yet of inward ioye she hadde habundaunce. And for to spekyn of hyr mekenesse, A mekere creatur no where þan she Was neuer noon, lyche as I gesse, For more meke soothly þer myht noon be; For þe more despect thyng were in ony degre, And þe more contemtyble in sundry wyse, Of them euere she hadde þe more cherte, And þe gladere was hem to exercyse. Thys sempt wel by oon þat in hyr seruyse So greuously syknyd, þe soth to seyn, That hym to seen yche man dede agryse And hym to touchyn had uery dysdeyn Saf she alone, þis ys certeyn; For of hym she had swyche tendyrnesse, That hys heed in hyr lap for to leyn She hym oft suffryd thorgh hyr gentylnesse. And not-wythstondyng hys horrybylnesse, Swych in mekenesse was hyr grace, lo, That alle hys sorys both more &amp; lesse, Whan no madyn of hyrs wold put hand to, Wyth a pyn or a nedle for to vndo And lete out þe fylthe she not dede abasshe, And hys ruggyd erys she clyppyd a[l]so, And wyth hyr owyn handys hys hede to wasshe. In ragacyouns also, aftyr hyr custum, In lynene clothys alway clad was she, And barefoot euere folwyd þe processyoun, So was she groundyd in humylyte. And eek at stacyouns wher sermons shuld be, She nold ben among þe statys hy, But among þe wummen of porest degre She alwey wold syttyn ful deuouthly. In hyr puryfycacyouns eek she ne wold Wyth precyous gemmys hyr dysguyse, Wyth nowchys nere wyth clothys of gold As of ladyis of astate yt ys þe guyse; But by exaunple of marye, in humble wyse In hyr owyn armys hyr chyldryn fre, Werdly pompe so vsyng to despyse, Wyth a lamb &amp; a candele up offryd she. And whan she from cherche cam home agen, In-to hyr chaumbyr she went hastyly And all þo clothys dede of, certeyn, Wyth wyche to cherche she went, sothly. And anoon forth-wyth euene by &amp; by, Ere þan she wolde to mete goon, To sum pore wumman wych dwellyd þer ny Awey she hem yaf euene euerychon. A tokne yt was also of greth mekenesse In hyr þat stood in swyche lyberte As she dede, &amp; in so greth wurthynesse, That to oon maystyr Conrade she wolde be Subiect, stondyng þe greth pouerte Wych he was yn, saf þat of kunnyng And of doctryne ful excellent was he, And ful perfyth eke was of good lyuyng. To whom, by leue of hyr husbonde, Thys humble &amp; most meke creature A solemne vow made in hys ryht hande Hym to obeyin wyth-outyn forfature In alle thyngis whyl hyr lyf dede endure; And þis she dede oonly for þat entent To purchasyn þe meryht of obedyens pure, And by exaunple of cryst to deyin obedyent. Not long aftyr þis up-on a day, Whan he hyr had clepyd to hys prechyng, And þe Markesesse of Me[n]ence kept hyr away That she ne myht kepyn hys byddyng, So greuously he bare hyr absentyng That no foryiuenesse he wolde hyr hete Tyl, to hyr smok voydyd hyr clothyng, Wyth othyr gylty maydyns she was bete. O uery mekenesse! o blyssyd obedyence! What wumman koude now obeyin to Swych a comaundement wythoute offence As dede þis myroure of pacyence, lo! Vnneth ony nunne yt mekely wold do; And, to seyn pleyn treuthe, I trowe yt nolde here Wyth-owtyn murmur &amp; grucchyng also Neythyr prest ner munk, chanoun ner frere. For both of men &amp; wummen also The molde þese dayis ys so sore alayde Wyth froward wyl, þat for to do Swyche obedyencys yf þei were asayide, They wolde compleyn &amp; ben euyl apayid. And þis ys o greth cause, as I dar wele saye, That relygyous gouernaunce ys so sore affrayid, For dew correccyouns ben al put aweye. But in þis mater I wyl no ferthyr walk Ner þer-of do make lenger exclamacyoun; For perauentur, yf I dyde treuly talke, Sum folk wolde haue greth indygnacyoun That fro my mater swych dylatacyoun I dede make wyth-owtyn nede; Wherfore to cece I make protestacyoun, An ageyn to Elyzabeth I wyl me spede. I sey þis myrour of uery obedyence, Thys blyssyd Elyzabeth, þe soth to seyn, Greth rygour vsyd of streyht abstynence, And wyth vygylyis &amp; dyscyplynys hir body dede peyn. And ful oftyn also she hyr dede restreyne From hyr husbondys bed, &amp; in priue manere Al nyht slepelees, þis ys certeyne, She perseuerently lay in hyr preyere. And yf yt happyd ony whyle þat she lest, Aftyr þat she long had wacchyd be, To graunt hyr body to haue sum rest, Constreynyd by þe comoun necessyte Of slepe as yt nedyth mannys freelte, To bed to hyr lord she nolde goon ageyn, But euyn in þe flore al clade wolde she Down on tapytys to slepe hyr leyn. Hyr maydyns also she vsyd to charge Ful oft sythys, in hyr lordys absence, Wyth yerdys wych wer both grete &amp; large Hyr body to betyn wyth greth vyolence. And þis she dede to make a recompence Of crystys chorgynge to þe byttyr peyn, And eek þat she wyth swych sharpnesse Hyr flesh from wantounnesse she myht refreyn. More-ouyr hyr abstynence in etyng And drynkyng to knowyn yf we wyl muse, And temperaunce eek in al swych thyng, I say þat ful oftyn she dede vse, At þe table syttyng, hyr to excuse To hyr husbonde, oonly for that entent That delycat metys she myht refuse, And wyth symple brede oonly to be content. For maystyr Conrade hyr had streythly Chargyd, no wyse þat she shuld eete Of hyr houshould metys wych conscyonsly Hyr thoute hyr seruauntys dede not gete. And for þis charge she nold forgete, Whan othyr delycatly dede habounde, She &amp; hyr maydyns oftyn dede frete The most groos metys þat myht be founde. But not-wythstondyng þe greth streyhtnesse That to hyr-self she vsyd contunely, Yet mete she wolde both hanlyn &amp; dresse, And departyn hyt aboutyn ful plenteuously Throgh-out þe alle both fer &amp; ny. Thys was þat in hyr of superstycyoun No n[o]te shuld be, but wyth curteysy Alle gestys comyng she glad shuld moun. It fel on a tyme, aftyr a longe iourne, Whan she both feynt was &amp; wery, That to mete were set hyr lorde &amp; she An seruyd wyth met wych certeynly Wer not, as she trowyd, get ryhtfully; Wherfore blak brede &amp; hard also, In hote watyr moystyd ful pacyently, Wyth hyr maydyns she eet &amp; content was so. For wych cause of hys most clere expence A certeyn porcyoun assygnyd he Wherby wyth-owte scrupyl of conscyence She &amp; hyr maydyns myht foundyn be, Wych wer assentyd to lyuyn in swych degre As her lady dede; but not-for-than Mete of þe courte ful often left she And eet þe meet of sum good pore man. Whan Langrauye þis maner of reule dede here Of hys wyf, he hyt suffryd pacyently, And neuere yt grucchyd in wurde &amp; chere, But rether yt approuid in hys thought preuy. And ful oftyn he seyd very feythfully Ne had be in part for the wardys shame And for trowble also of hys meny, He gladly wold han done þe same. The state moreouyr of wylful pouerte, Wych no weye contendyth for to be gaye, Not-wythstondyng hyr hy dygnyte, In wyl she desyryd from day to day; And þat for two causys, þe soth to sey, Fyrst to crystys pouerte for to be kynde, And þat þe werde wyth hys pompous aray Shuld of hys in hyr ony propyr thyng fynde. Wherfore ful oftyn þis blyssyd matrone, Whan in hyr chaunbyr euene preuyly Wyth hyr owyn maydyns she was alone, She hyr wolde arayin ful porely Whyth rude clothys, &amp; also on hy Vp-on hyr hede leyn a foule kerche, Seying: ‘lo, þus wyl I goon sothly Whanne I come to þe state of pouerte.’ And thow wyth þe brydyl of abstynence She hyr-self refreynyd, as herd haue ye Yet to pore men swych affluence Of almesse she [rehe]rsyd &amp; swych lyberalte, That she noon suffryd wych she myht se In-to myserye or myschef for to falle; Wherfore thorgh-oute al þat cuntre ‘Modyr of pore men’ folk dede hyr calle. And to þe seuene werkys of mercy Wyth greth dylygence she dede intende, And hem euere fulfyllyd ryht deuouthly, For þat entent þat she myht comprende That frendely blyssyng wych cryst shal sende To hys chosen chyldren, whan in aspecyal Of þese werkys he þem shal comende And seyn: ‘comyth, takyth þe kyndam ternal!’ And shortly to makyn a rehersayle Of hem, I saye þe she wold gladely Clothe þe pore nakyd, ner she nold fayle Pore pylgrymys to beryin ful honestly. She made also crysmys ful dylygently For pore chyldryn whan þai shul crystyn be, And wolde be godmodyr þat she þerby To helpe hem myht haue þe more lyberte. Ful oftyn wyth hyr maydyns also wold she Wyth hyr owyn handys wul spyn &amp; dresse To makyn of cloth, &amp; þat for causys thre: Fyrst wyth hyr labour to excludyn ydylnesse; Exaunple eek to shewyn of mekenesse; The thryd cause ys þat wyt þe laboure Of hyr owyn handys she myht doon almesse To pore men wych askyd for crystys honour. The hungry more-ouyr she vsyd to fede, Yeuyng vytalys ful plenteuously To alle þo peples wych weryn in nede, But in tyme of derthe most copyously. Wherfore onys whan hyr husbonde sothly Wyth Frederyk þe emperoure was at Cremone, Alle hys garners she emptyd vttyrly, And delt corn a-boute where ony made mone. Drynk also wyth ryht glad chere Ful oftyn she yaf on-to þe thrusty. Wherof a greth myracle, as ye shal here, Fel onys; for whyl she to a greth company Yaf bere in a cuppe ful dylygently Wyth hyr owyn handys thorgh hyr mekenesse, Whan þei alle had dronkyn suffycyently Yet of beere in þe cuppe was neuyr þe lesse. And for to spekyn of hyr hospytalyte, She þer-yn had so gret affeccyoun, That pylgrymys &amp; al men in pouerte To herberwyn she vsyd wyth deuocyoun. Wherfore an hospytale in þe vale doun Euene vndyr þe castel she dede make, In wych þo þat up shuld not clymbyn moun Shuld receyuyd ben &amp; hyr almes take. But not-wythstondyng þe dyffyculte Of to &amp; fro goyng both up &amp; doun, Yet yche day onys at þe lest wold she Of þis hospytal makyn vysytacyoun, And to þe seke men makyn admynystracyoun Of swych as þey nedyd, &amp; þer-wyth-alle She hem yaf many an exhortacyoun That þei from pacyence shuld not falle. And þow she [e]uery stynkyng exalacyoun Of þe eyr bare alwey heuyly, Yet for goddys loue seke mennys corrupcyoun She not abhorryd, but ful pacyently It suffryd euyr, &amp; eek ful dylygently Hyr besyid hem for to helpe &amp; cure Whan hyr maydyns wych stodyn by Vnneth of hem myht þe breth endur. Pore wummens chyldryn also vsyd she In þat place to kepyn ful many oon, To wych she shewyd as grete cherte As she modyr had be to þem euerychon. And whanne she cam, sume to hyr runne anoon As chyldryn to þe modyr, &amp; sume dede crepe, And eftsonys whan she awey dede goon, As she here modyr had ben þei gunne wepe. Smale pottys of glas she onys dede beye And anelectys eek wych ryht freel be, The chyldryn þer-wyt for to pley As yt was þe guyse of þat cuntre; And as in hyr lappe doun broght hem she, From þe hyest cra vnwarely at onys They fel, noon harmyd in no degre, Al-be-yt þei fel on ryht greth stonys. Seke wummen eek was hyr delyte In þat cuntre wych bedlaure dede lye, Both yunge &amp; olde, for to vysyte, As fer as she ony koude aspye; And here preuy chaunbrys she wold yn prye To knowyn her nede ful dylygently, And þem to counforth she wold hyr hye Both wyth wurde &amp; dede cherytabylly. In wych dede, as me semyth sothly, She by fyue-folde of consyderacyoun Of god purchasyd rewarde eternally: Fyrst by propyr &amp; personel vysytacyoun, By trauayle eek in goyng up &amp; doun, The thrydde ys compassyoun &amp; pyte, The fourte ys gostly consolacyoun, The fyfte of temporal subsydye ys plente. She also wele louyd to beryin pore men, And in þat dede she had swyche lykyng, That whan of ony she herde she fast dede ren Tyl she cam þer, wyt hyr beryng Sum maner cloth of hyr owyn makeyng, In wych she myht þe deed body leyn; And tyl yt were beryid, for no thyng Home she ne wolde returne ageyn. And onys yt happyd þat no thyng redy Aftyr hyr entent she myht fynde To wrap in a mannys deede body, For þat she ordeynyd was left behynde For greth haste; &amp; þer-wyth to hyr mynde Cam hyr greth vayle, &amp; anoon she hyt rent, The deed body there-yn to wynde, And þer-[y]n yt beryid wyth humble entent. Lo, þus exercysyd was þis blyssyd wumman In þe seuene werkys of bodyly pyte, An mo wysys þan I now tellyn can; In wych eke hyr husbonde comendyd may be For to godwarde ryht deuouht was he. And for he swych werkys myht not tendyn to, Hys wyf leue he yaf and auctoryte For her bothyns profyht what hyr lyst to do. Thus longe to-gedyr lyuyd these two, Langrauye &amp; Elyzabeth, ful uerteuously, And up-on a day she hym þus seyd to: ‘Dere spouse, whom next god most tendyrly I loue &amp; euere haue done treuly, I counsel you fully you to delyte To leuyn alle þese ocupacyouns werdly, And þe londe of behest for to vysyte, I mene ierusalem, &amp; al þat cuntre In wych cryst made hys bodyly pylgrimage, An for oure sake þer deyid on a tre, Betrayid by þe iewys cruel outrage; Wych now hethyn men kepyn in seruage. Where, yf þou woldyst wyth a deuouth entent To delyueryn yt exercysyn þi corage, I ne kan seen where yt myht bettyr be spent. Bettyr, no! ner nowher ellys so weel In þis werd, y dar ryht boldly seye! For who be þe cours of þe fatal whele In þat holy iourne happe for to deye, If he be clene he goth a sykyr weye To heuenewarde, for he may not fayle. Wherfore, husbonde, I you counsel &amp; preye For soule hele forsake not þis trauayle.’ Thus, thorgh þese wordys &amp; many mo Of Elyzabeth, Langrauye was steryd treuly To Ierusalem on pylgrimage for to go And ageyn þe hethene to fyhtyn manly. And whan he hym made al redy And shuld furth passyn on hys pylgrimage, To takyn hys leue he cam ful goodly To Elyzabeth stondyng in opyn pla[g]e. And þer anoon ful many a wattryng face Of lordys &amp; ladyis men myht aspye, And þe comouns þer clothys dede al to-race, And weptyn eek wyth-outyn remedye. And summe lowde: ‘allace, allace!’ dede crye. ‘Why forsakyst us, oure lord, o Langrauy?’ But Elyzabeth hyr eyne from terys kept drye, And þus to hym seyde ful wummanly: ‘Wyth what affeccyoun &amp; how enterely I þe loue, dere spouse, &amp; euyr haue do, No man knowyth but god &amp; þou &amp; I, Wych not oonly in fleshe bodyly, lo, By þe knot of spousayle ioynyd hath us two, But in spyryth eek thorgh hys cheryte So to-gedyr confedryd hath so That impossyble ys vndo þe knot to be. But why y now shuld wepe in ony wyse Resonable cause kan I noon se, Syth I se þe goon to doon hym seruyse Whom I loue in most souereyn degre. Sumtyme I sorwyd whan thow wentyst fro me, But now neythyr sorwyn ne wepyn I may, Be so þat cryst thorgh hys benygnyte The grace yiue to seruyn hym to hys pay.’ Thus Langrauye, as crystys owyn knyht, Armyd in uertu &amp; in cheryte, Leue takyn goodly of euery wyht, To Ierusalem forth took hys iourne. Where whan [he] had a certeyn tyme be, And in goddys cause quyt hym ful manly The froyht of hys labour þere receyuyd he, And deyid &amp; went to goddys mercy. And þus entryd Elyzabeth consequently The state of wydewod, in wych þat she Exercysyd was ful uerteuously And assaylyd wyth ful myche aduersyte, And hyr pacyence assayid in sundry degre. But she so was rotyd in stedefastnesse That in no wyse she hurt myht be, For alle thyng she suffryd wyth gladnesse. Anoon þan as by þe trumpet of fame Blowe was thorgh-out al Turyngye Langrauyis deth, Elyzabethys grame Began to growyn, for euene sodeynly Langrauyis brothyr, by uery tyrauntrye, As she a wastour &amp; a dystroyour had be, From hyr dowarye hyr drof ful vnpytouslye And from alle þat she hadde in ony degre. And whan she was brought to swych pouerte That she ne hadde where hyr heed to leye, In a tauerners hous in a swyncote lay she Tyl mydnyht, &amp; þan she took þe weye To a place of menours, [&amp;] hem dede preye Te deum laudamus to synge wyth deuocyoun, That he hyr maad wurthy, er she dede deye, To suffren despyht &amp; persecucyoun. The next day aftyr compellyd she was Wyth hyr yunge chyldryn &amp; hir maydyns also Of oon of hyr enmyis to dwellyn in þe place, Where a streyht loggyng was sygnyd hyr to. And both hyr ost &amp; hyr ostes hyr dede do Alle þe greuaunce þat þei coude deuyse. And whan she þis sey, ful humbylly, lo, Bad þe wallys fare wele, seying þis wyse: ‘Yf I hadde foundyn in þis place here In men &amp; wummen ony gentylnesse, I wolde han leue take of hem wyth a glad chere. But syth I noon fynde, I me hens wyl dresse.’ And þus constreynyd by ful greth dystresse, To hyr fyrst herberwe ageyn she went. But fyrst hyr chyldryn for þere tendyrnesse To be norsshyd to sundry placys she sent. And onys hyr [h]appyd to pacyn forth by A ryht foule weye, whedyr she wold goon, Wych ryht depe was &amp; ryht vnesy, Wher-yn was leyde ful many a stoon, Many a blok &amp; many an hors-boon, In wych men myht skape goyng warlye, And ellys pleynly þer myht noon Scapyn awey wyth clothys drye. And euene as she entryd had þe strete, An old wumman, to whom hyr mercy She oftyn had shewyd, she ther dede mete; But weye she hyr yeuyn nolde, treuly, An so in þe slooth she fel rewly. And as sone as she myht she dede upryse, And was not wroth but low meryly, And wypt hyr clothys in ful besy wyse. Aftyr þis an abbesse of greth dygnyte, Wych hyr graundam was by lyneal descence, Hauyng compassyoun of hyr pouerte, To þe bysshope hyr broht of hauenberegence, Wych was hyr eme, a man of greth reuerence; And he hyr receyuyd ful honestly, Purposyng to doon al hys dylygence Hyr ayen to maryin ful solemnely. And whan hyr maydyns þis herd preuyly, Wych wyth hyr had vowyd to ke[pe] chastyte, In her hertys inward þei wer sory, Dredyng uttyrly þat yt so shuld be. Wherfore þei weptyn þat pyte was to se; And wan þei yt hyr tolde, ful sore wepyng She fyrst was astoynyd of þat nouelte, And þus aftyr þem counfortyd, mekely seying: ‘I truste in my god oonly, for whos loue Perpetuel avowyd I haue contynence, Þat he wyl my purpose gracyously approue, And brekyn to þat contrarye euery vyolence, And geyn al mannys counsel make resystence. And yf I noon oþir wyse may me sure make, Kuttyn of my nose I shal in here presence; Þan me so dyfformyd no man shal wyl take.’ And forth-wyth at þe bysshopys comaundement Thys blyssyd Elyzabeth ful of humyly[t]e Maugre hyr teth to a castel was sent, Ther to abydyn hyr frendys decre, And to sum wurthy man maryid to be. But she hyr comyttyd to god in hyr thouht. And in þe mene tyme fro be-yonde þe se Hyr husbondys bonys by goddys grace wer broht. Thanne anoon ageyn she fecchyd was þens Wyth þe seyd bonys to metyn deuouthly. And whan þat she was commyn, wyth greth reuerence The bysshope &amp; she wyth a greth cumpany Them ageynys wentyn processyonally. And whan þei were receyuyd, she dede conuerte To godward in heuene hyr eyne mekely, Thus to hym seying wyth a deuouth hert: ‘Euere-lestyng honour, lorde, be to þe, Wych in myne husbondys bonys home sendynge Hast vouchyd-saf of þi benygnyte Thy wrechyd handmayd to yiuyn gladynge. Thow knowyst wel, lorde, thow y hym þe lyuynge Louyd next þe, yet, lord, for þine honoure I gladly hym wantyd, &amp; wyth-oute wepynge To Ierusalem I sent hym yt for to sokour. And al-be-yt to me ful delectable yt were Wyth hym to han lyuyd euere in swyche pouerte That yche of vs shulde haue been a beggere, And thorgh al þe werd sowt oure necessyte, Yet wold I not, lord, wytnesse of the, Ageyn þi wyl hys raunson appende Oon heer of myn hede; wherfore hym &amp; me Oonly to þi grace I lowly recomende.’ And whan she þis wyse receyuyd had Hyr husbondys bonys fro be-yunde þe se, Inwardly in hert she was ful glad. And anoon she wyth greth solemnyte Hem dede beryin; &amp; aftyr þat seyd she Thys wys to þe bysshope in wurdys pleyn: ‘Syr, syth my lord ys now comyn home to me, Othyr husbonde wyl I neuere haue noon, certeyn.’ And þat þe hundyrdfold fruht she ne shuld lese Wych longyth to hem þat wyth stedefastnesse Of crystys gospel þe perfeccyoun do chese, And fro þe lyfth hand passyth of wrechydnesse To þe ryht hand of heuenely blysfulnesse, The state she entryd of pore relygyoun, Wylful pouerte wyth chast clennesse Kepyng, &amp; of obedyence þe subieccyoun. Hyr habyth contemptyble &amp; of lytyl valu Was russet, þe werst þat myht be founde, Wych ful oftyn wyth cloth of a-nothyr heu Was lengthyd þat yt myht touche þe grounde And for al nyce pryde she wold confounde, Whanne hyr sleuys wer rent wer seruyd þe same. And for she in mekenesse so dede habounde, To spynnyn &amp; cardyn she hadde no shame. And whan hyr fadyr, þe kyng of vngary, As ys seyd beforn, al þis dede here, How she was brouht to pouerte &amp; myserye, An erl he sent, wych he louyd entere, Thedyr anoon hyr to counfortyn &amp; chere, And to steryn hyr to returne to hym ageyn. And whan to hyr presence he gan appere, He astoynyd was, &amp; þus dede seyn: ‘Was neuere kyngys doughtyr, I trow certeyn, So euyl arayid &amp; in so rode degre Seyn syttyng &amp; vsyn werkys vyleyn!’ And anoon doun knelyng to hyre seyd he: ‘Leue al thys, lady, &amp; return wyth me Home to your fadyr wyth-owt more let.’ But for nouht he coude seyn yt nolde be, For þus to lyuyn &amp; deyin hyr hert was set. And þat hyr hert myht oonly to god up pace, And so no lettyng shuld han hyr deuocyoun, She hym preyid enterly of hys specyal grace That he hyr grauntyn wold of al temporal possessyoun Contempt, &amp; from hyr hert al delectacyoun Of hyr chyldryn takyn in euery degre, And ageyn al spyht &amp; eek desolacyoun Constaunth &amp; pacyent euere for to be. And whan she had preyid hertyly þis wyse, To hyr maydyns she seyd: ‘god my preyere So hath herd þat I as dung now despyse Al temporal þingis, &amp; my chyldryn here To me þan oþir mennys be no more dere; And despyht &amp; reproue I set ryht not by. And þerfore me semyth wyth myn herte entere I loue no thyng ellys but god hym-self oonly.’ Eek Maystyr Conrade, hyr for to proue, Ioynyd hyr oftyn þingys to hyr ful conrary. And two maydyns wych she lengest dede loue, Wych wyth hyr of youthe had be contunely, He put a-way out of hyr cumpany. And þis he dede oonly to þat ende, That hyr dygnytes &amp; hyr fyrst glory They shulde not reducyn o[n]t[o] hyr mynde. But in al hys preceptys, euene by &amp; by, Wych he hyr bad, wyth-out resystence Or murmur or grocchyng, eueremore redy She was foundyn to hys obedyence, And þer-wyth constaunte to pacyence; By wych hyr soule she myht possede, And by meke obecyaunce wyth-outyn vyolence, She myht vyctory han &amp; heuene to mede. And oft she seyde: ‘yf for god drede y An erdely man, þe heuenely iuge to fere Mych more I owe; &amp; þerfore trewely To þis pore man, wyche ys but a beggere, I chese to be subiect &amp; obedyent rathere Than to ony oþir more ryche man, To escheu al occasyouns þat I myht lere By wych temporal counfort I ony myht han.’ Aftyr þis yt happyd in-to a nunnery Hyr onys to entryn wyth-owtyn hys leue, Requyryd of þe nunnys ful deuouthly, Wych hym so sore dede agreue, That not wyth wurde oonly he hir dede repreue, But he hyr so sore eek dede betyn be That thre wokys aftyr both morwe &amp; eue The merkys of hyr wundys men myht se. And þan to hyr maydyns she dede seye, Both for here &amp; hyre owyn consolacyoun: ‘Lyche as, whan a flode rysyth up heye, Gres goth vndyr, &amp; whan yt fallyth doun Gres surmountyth, so, whan afflycccyoun To us comyth, we owyn wyth mekenesse Us to submyt, &amp; whan yt sesyth we moun Rysyn up to god wyth [g]o[s]tly gladnesse.’ And so wele she groundyd was in loulynesse That she nolde suffryn in no maner wyse, Hyr maydyns hyr clepyn ‘lady’ nere ‘maystresse’, Nere, whan she cam, ageyn hyr for to ryse, As among ientelys yt ys þe guyse; Nere in þe plurere noumbyr spekyn hyr to But oonly in þe syngulere, she hem dede deuyse, As souereyns to subiectys be won to do. She dysshys in þe kechyn ful oftyn also Wolde wasshyn &amp; wypyn; to exclude lettyng, Hyr maydyns she sent oþir thyngys to do In þe mene tyme of þis doyng. And ful oftyn she seyd, wyth chere smylyng, If ony lyf of more despecteuousnesse She coude han fondyn in ony thyng, She hyt wold han chosyn wyth greth gladnesse. Aftyr þis, þat she myht wyth marye Of þe best part han sum porcyoun, Hyr-self ful dylygently she dede applye To ben exercysyd in contemplacyoun, In wych she had so greth consolacyoun That aftyr terys wych she shedde copyously She had many an heuenely vysytacyoun, And men to loue god she steryd besyly. And þis grace she had most syngulerly, That when she sempte most mery to be, Than of pore deuocyoun most copyously She terys out shedde, ful of pyte; And þat was doon in so meruelous degre That wepyng &amp; ioying to ony manys syht To-gedyr she was, for no deformyte Ner rymple aspyin in hyr no man myht. ‘For tho wych in wepynge,’ quod she, ‘Deformen her chere inordynally And altryn her face in sundry degre, God to skornyn þei seme treuly; But so to doon yt ys vncomely. Wherfore yche man for hys byhoue That he yeuyth god, yeue yt gladly, For a glad yiuer god doth loue.’ And in þis astate of contemplacyoun Wych she wyth Marye dede excercyse, Many an holy reuelacyoun And many a vysyoun of hy empryse To hyr was shewyd in sundry wyse, Of wych oon I now entende Here to tellyn, as doth deuyse Ianuence in hys golden legende. Onys swych tym as euery man That crystene ys doth hys deuer Wyth al þe dylygence þat he kan From synne to make hys conscynce cler, I mene in lente, wyth þe feer Enflawmyd of perfyht cheryte, In a cherche in deuouth preyer As she lay, thus vysytyd was she. On-to þe awter as she hyr eyne Vpward kest wyth greth dylygence, So sadly fyxid þei wer both tweyne And stablysshyd wyth so greth reuerence As she had ben in goddys presence; And þis enduryd a ful longe space, Wher wyth heuenely influence And gostly conforth she refresshyd was. But whan she home cam, &amp; for febylnesse In hyr maydyns lappe lenyd softly, Owt at a wyndow she dede dresse To heueneward hyr eyne ful deuouthly, And anoon forth-wyth euene sodeynly Swych gladnes in hyr þer dede appere And swych ioye þat [r]yht enterly She low, &amp; wyth hy hertly chere. And whan she longe in þis vysyoun Of greth gladnesse had counfortyd be, Sodeynly hyr hert syne she kest doun And shed oute terys in greth plente. And eftsonys she low as fyrst dede she, And aftyr wept ageyn ful plenteuously; And tyl complyn tym in swych degre She altenyd þe tyme meruelously. And whan þat she longe in þis manere Contunyd had, no word seyng, At þe last wyth a ful glad chere She gan to oysyn þis talkyng, As she had answerd to a-nothyr spekyng: ‘Ya, lord, wylt þou ben wyth me? So to be wyth þe yt ys my lykyng, And from þe neuere departyd to be.’ And aftyr þis, whan she preyid was Of hyr maydyns wyth humble supplycacyoun That she wolde of a specyal graas, To goddys worshepe &amp; here edyfycacyoun, Declaren to hem hyr reuelacyoun That she had þan, &amp; what yt ment, And by here inportune preyer ouyr-comyn, She þus hem shewyd hyr entent: ‘I sawe þan,’ quod she, ‘heuene on hy Beforn me opnyd to my semyng, And Ihesu my loue most benygnely Of hys good grace to me bowyng. And whan I hys chere most bryht shynyng Behelde, so ful I was of gladenesse Myn hertys ioye þan wyth lawhyng Me thouht I coude no bettyr expresse. And eftsonys, whan yt hys goodnesse Lykyd hys presence to wythdrawyn fro me, I so oppressyd was wyth heuynesse And ouyrcomyn wyth sorwe in swyche degre As ye þan dede beholde and se; And for I myht not hym wyth me kepe At my wyl, whan he dede fle, I koude noht ellys but sorwyn &amp; wepe. But whan yt plesyd hys mercyfulnesse On me to rewyn &amp; han mercy, He shewyd me ageyn þe bryhtnesse Of hys glad chere, &amp; seyd goodly: “Yf þou wyth me wylt ben, sothly I wyl be wyth þe, be not aferde.” And I hym answerde ageyn redyly Euene in swyche forme as ye haue herde.’ And þan hyr maydyns gunne hyr beseche That þe vysyoun wych at þe autere Che had in cherche she wold hem teche. And she hem answerd in þis manere: ‘It nedyth not you þat for to here; But þis I wyl ye knowe treuly That in ioye &amp; myrth I was entere, And þer many a prynce of god I sy.’ And not oonly þus in contemplacyoun Thys blyssyd wumman had þat honour To be inspyryd wyth heuenely reuelacyoun, But hyr preyer eek had swych fauour, So strong was eek &amp; of swyche vygour, That sum, wych cold bodyly were And gostly, yt causyd of both feruour, As by an exaunple ye may lere. A yong man oo tyme she dede se, Arayid, as she thouhte, to seculerly, To whom she seyd in þis degre: ‘Yung man, þou lyuyst to dyssoluthly, An seruyst not oure souereyn lord on hy. Desyryst ony helpe of my preyere?’ ‘Ya, þat I do,’ quod he, ‘sekyrly. I beseche yow þer-of wyth herte entere.’ And she a-noon wyth ful glad chere, Desyryng þis yung man for to wynne, Bygan to makyn hyr preyere, An counselyd hym eek for hys synne To preyin also; &amp; anoon wyth-ynne He wex uery hoot in al hys body; Wherfore of preying þat she wolde blynne He hyr besowht ful benygnely. But she preyid furth &amp; wold not cece Wyth deuouht herte &amp; entent pure, And euere hys hete dede more encrece, Þat no lengere hym þouht he yt myht endure. Wherfore he cryid: ‘o blysful creature, Sesyth of preying, I beseche yow; For so sore I brenne þat my nature Consumyth &amp; wastyth, but I ne woot how.’ And in uery treuth so hote was he That he swet &amp; rekyd meruelously, And hys armys as he wood had be Kest to &amp; fro &amp; al hys body, As ych man myht se þat stode hym by, Wych hym myht neyþir reule ne stere. And so he ferd euere contunely Whyl Elyzabeth contunyd hyr preyere. And whan she secyd &amp; preyid no more Hys heet eek secyd, &amp; he mekely Knelyng thankyd hyr þerfore. And anoon he, compunct inwardly, Seyng how strong &amp; how myhty Hyr preyer was, wyth an holy entent The werd he forsuke uttyrly, And to þe menours ordre went, Of þe holy conuersacyoun of þis wumman, Blyssyd Elyzabeth, who-so lyst to knowe Mo exaunplys, he redyly may han In Ianuencis legend, wych ys kouth &amp; knowe; Two or thre stondyn euene by rowe Next þis wych last I of made mende. But as for me, now best ys, I trow, To eschewe prolyxite, to make an ende. For þow I had kunnyng for to ryme And eek to endyten as copyously As had Gower &amp; chaunce[r]s in þer tyme, Or as now hath þe munk of bery, Ioon Lytgate, yet cowd not I Thys blyssyd wumman Elyzabeth commende Aftyr hyr merytys suffycyently, And þerfore to secyn I now intende. What tym þat god þis blyssyd creature, Thys holy Elyzabeth, þorgh hys goodnesse Delyueryn wold from þe foule ordure Of þis woful werdys wrechydnesse, And bryngyn hyr up to þe gladsumnesse, Of þe blysse of heuene to hyr [h]e sent, To been hyr massagere, a feruent accesse; And she yt receyuyd wyth glade entent. And as she lay in þis syknesse, To þe wall she hyr turnyd sodeynly; And euyn furth-wyth of greth swetnesse Syngyng she made a melody. And anoon hyr maydyns stondyng by To hyr went, &amp; hyr dede beseche Of þis melodyus song þe cause why She wold fouchesaf hem for to teche. To whom demurely þus answed she: ‘I wyl þat ye haue ful knowlechyng That here betwyx þe wal and me Cam sodeynly a feyre byrd flying, SWych as I neuyr sawe in my lyuyng, And to syng began in so sweth manere That I ne myht ne conteyne for no thyng But song wyth hyr, as ye dede here.’ And in þis syknesse she euere mery Was &amp; neuere secyd for to preye. But whan hyr tym neyhyd ny, That ys to seyn, whan she shuld deye, The day beforn she þus dede seye To hyr maydyns: ‘what wold ye do If þe deuyl, wych ych man to trey Is euere besy, come now yow to?’ And anoon aftyr she had seyd so, Wyth an hy voys she gan to crye As þow þe deuyl she had spoke to: ‘Fle fast awey, &amp; hens the hye’— And þus thryi[s] she dede specyfye Thys wurd ‘fle’—‘for I the despyse!’ Aftyr wych wurdys, ful demurely To hyr maydyns she seyd þis wyse: ‘Lo, now neyhyth þe tyme of mydnyht In wych cryst Ihesu born wold be, And yn þat same oure he throgh hys myht To hys heuenely dwellyng clepyd hath me. Now, fare wele alle!’ &amp; þer-wyth she In-to þe handys of hyr creatour Yald up hyr spiryth, &amp; anoon yt he Led in at þe gatys of hys heuennely tour. And not-wythstondyng þat hyr body Foure dayis kept vnberyid was Aftyr hyr deth, yet certeynly Noon euyl odour from yt dede paas, But rather an odour of solace, Wych alle men meruelously dede conforte That al þat tyme in-to þat place The body to vysyte dede resorte. [M]ore-ouyr of byrdys a ful greth route, Swych as men to-forn neuere had se, On þe cherche-rof syttyng wyth-owte, Begunne to synge in meruelous degre, And in here song madyn swych melode Þat alle men wundryd þat yt dede here, For, as yt sempt, þei seydyn a dyryge In her maner wyt ful glad chere. Now, blyssyd Elyzabeth, wyth hert entere And al humblenesse, I þe beseche, Accepte þe entent of my preyere: For my synnys to þe heuenely leche Be medyatryce, &amp; a mene me teche How wyth-owtyn ony empechement Askapyn I may þe cruel wreche, The day of þe last iugement. And fynally, lady, to þe trew entent Of hyr attende wych specyally Thy lyf to make me yaf comaundement, And þe in hert louyth ful affecteuosly, I mene Dame Elyzabeth ver, sothly. A chartyr hyr purchase here of pardoun, And whan she shal passyn from þis owtlaury, Of god hyr brynge to þe contemplacyoun. Amen mercy ihesu &amp; gramercy.</field>
