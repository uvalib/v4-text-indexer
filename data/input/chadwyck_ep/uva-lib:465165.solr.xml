No Windsor-Forest or the Banks of Thame Inspire my Muse, or lift her Voice to Fame; On Hills remote, the northern Shepherd sings, Not less Variety, nor fewer Springs; As many Suns diversify our Year, Nor want we Shade or Summer Zephyr here. Thou, whom kind Nature has with Genius blest; Distinguish'd both for Judgment and for Taste! Not prone to blame, nor falsely to commend, At once a gen'rous Critic, and a Friend; Accept the lowly Numbers I rehearse, To thee, the Muse presents this early Verse. 'Twas when the Dawn had cast it's lucid Grey O'er all the East, and promis'd shining Day, That blithsome Damon, rouz'd from peaceful Dreams Of mossy Fountains, and of silvan Scenes, O'er lofty Hills with various turnings stray'd, Or on his past'ral Staff supinely weigh'd: Now o'er his fleecy Charge he casts his View, And marks their blended Traces in the Dew; To freshest Pastures he directs their Way, And counts, lest any Wanderer should stray. And now he travels with his Eye below, Where Shades lie thick, and winding Rivers flow, Or Plains projected, shew their youthful green, With intermingling Beds of Flowers between. Charm'd with the Beauties of the blooming Spring, Thus the rapt Shepherd taught his Muse to sing. O, charming Season! hail, propitious Year! Kind to the Swain, and prosp'rous to his Care. No parching Drought diminishes the Stream, Or Rains excessive, o'er the Meadows swim; Nor angry Tempests gather in the Skies, Nor Winds above the Strength of Zephyrs rise; But genial Gleams, by turns with fruitful Showers, Call on the Greens to rise, and spread the Flowers; And while we joyful, view the teeming Soil, We thank kind Heav'n, for Heav'n is pleas'd to smile. With Pleasure, we the rural Toil renew, And gen'rous Nature bribes us to pursue; For no Inclemencies retard our Pains, But infant Plenty laughs along the Plains: We view the early Bud and rising Bloom, And joyful, deem the fruitful Crop to come. While with a ravish'd Heart and thankful Mind, We say, 'tis Heav'n that works, and Heav'n is kind. See, while the rising Sun displays the Morn, What gay Varieties the Meads adorn; What charming Colours spangle in my View, Glow with the Day, and glitter in the Dew; In sweet Diversities the Hills arise, And o'er the Plains a bright enamel lies, All loosely thrown, confus'dly regular; Heav'n owns the Works, the Works a Heav'n declare. Here Banks, which Winter naked left, and bare, Now bloom in Flowers, and Verdures rise up there, Delightful Buds are by the Bramble born, And blushing Roses open on the Thorn; The joyful Husbandman his Orchard sees, Where Sheets of Blossoms flourish o'er his Trees; Fine Promises of golden Fruit to come, And Heav'n indulgent nourishes the Bloom. See, there the purling Streamlet gently flows A-down the Hills, still swelling as it goes; Now streight, now turn'd, then winding on again, Visits each Field, and murmurs thro' the Plain; While, all along, in blended Scenes, the Flowers, Grace the long Bank, and dally with the Course: Nature all joy'd, laughs upwards on the Skies, And Heav'n too pleas'd, returns us Paradise. Hark, how the Woods and Hedges seem to vie, Which sends the sweetest warbles to the Skie: With the loud Throstle, there the Copsie rings, The Black-Bird whistles, and the Linnet sings; Here the gay Goldfinch chants a pleasing Strain, And there the lofty Lark forsakes the Plain. While Rocks reply, and Hills repeat the Voice, And Heav'n which gave, receives the grateful Noise. Hail beauteous Spring! thou ever joyful Scene! Varied in Flowers, and open'd out in green; When in these Charms thou risest to our Sight, Our Souls are struck with Wonder and Delight; On bleaky Winter we reflect no more, But view with Rapture, what we wish'd before. To speak Heav'n's Power, all Nature's Works conspire, And grateful Praises fill the gen'ral Choir. Ye blooming Groves, where Zephyrs softly breathe, Ye Beds of Primroses which shine beneath, Ye Banks of Vi'lets, Cowslips on the Plain, Roses in Hedges, King-cups on the green, Birds in the Woods, and Larks upon the Skies, Say, is't not Spring that makes you all rejoyce? Does not the Season all those Pleasures bring? And Heav'n, indulgent Heaven! send you Spring? Screen'd in these Shades, O ever let me stay! And sweetly sooth a lonely Life away; Still pleas'd to live, nor fearful of my End, The Muses my Companions, Heav'n my Friend. PARTING. Pastoral II. To Mr. B. Ayrey. Dear Friend, unbend a-while thy Thoughts, and deign, To hear the humble Musick of the Plain. The silvan Muse, of Daphnis' parting sings, And tells in lowly Numbers, lowly Things: Be pleas'd to smile upon my rural Lay, A Smile from AYREY, will my Pains o'er pay. Daphnis, a Swain, whom cruel Fate demands To leave his lofty Hills and furrow'd Lands: To leave his Hills, but more his Phebe, prest A load of Grief within his anxious Breast. Whilst on a Bank, arising from the Plain, His Partners sit, on either Hand the Swain; But Phebe nearest to the Shepherd plac'd, Lean'd on his Breast, his Arm around her Waist; (Such Freedom, native Innocence allows, When all the Heart with kind Affection glows.) Touch'd with a tender Sorrow, thus began The Swain in mournful Numbers to complain. My Dear! to die with thee, would surely give, Not half that Anguish, as to part and live; For what is Life, when ev'ry Pleasure's fled, But still a Dying, yet be never dead? Ah me! it must be done, why lingers more, My foolish Heart? this Parting must be o'er; Then follows Absence.—Now methinks I rove O'er Hills unknown, and mourn my hapless Love; Or laid alone within some joyless Shade, My Fancy figures out my distant Maid. While thus I dream, I see some happier Swain, Clasp the dear Fair, while sorrowful I plain; Daphnis forgot, and Phebe turns unkind, And all her plighted Vows resolve in Wind. O never let me know that hapless Morn, First let me die and never more return! 'Mongst hospitable Strangers be my Fall, Not mourn'd by any, and forgot by all! What have I said? O why should jealous Fears, Disturb my Breast, and fill my Eyes with Tears? I know my Phebe (lovely as the Flowers, Bright Gleams display, between soft April Showers) Is fill'd with Innocence, and Faith, and Truth, As fix'd as Age, tho' full of charming Youth; O she's all Goodness, as she is all fair, Joy of my Days, and Comfort of my Care! Tho' now we part, yet we shall meet again, And double Joys atone for ev'ry Pain. Like as in Fields o'ercharg'd with constant Show'rs, Hangs down the Grass, and droop the weary Flow'rs; But when the Mists and Clouds dispers'd in Streams, Let down the Sun-shine, and reflect his Beams, Rises the Grass, and open out the Flowers, The Sun more welcome, and a Bliss the Showers. So we, when once we see this Absence o'er, Shall meet more Joy, than e'er we met before; Our joining Breasts a keener Bliss shall fill, A warmer Rapture and a fiercer Thrill; Each will be newer to each other's Sight, And ev'ry Pain will introduce Delight. Fly swift ye Minutes, bring that happy Hour, Which Daphnis unto Phebe shall restore; O how I long to see that Moment nigh, When ravish'd all, in Phebe's Arms I lie, And softly tell the Thoughts which Absence rais'd, How oft I sigh'd her Name, how much I prais'd: How many Times my Prostrate Soul did move In ardent Prayers to ev'ry Power above, To guard my Charmer, and preserve my Fair From ev'ry Ill, and each deluding Snare. And Phebe in her turn, with melting Glee, Shall sweetly say whate'er she thought of me: While Kisses, soft as Kindness can prepare, Those Lips which tell the pretty Tale, shall share. The Thought of that dear Day revives my Heart, Nor dread I Absence, nor I mourn to part. But when I'm gone, ye Swains who bear the Crook, Or climb the Hills, or wander by the Brook, If ever in your Thoughts I claim'd a Share, Or justly you the Name of Friendship bear: If ever to my Tales you've merry made, Or danc'd, or listen'd to the Tunes I play'd, If ever I have any Kindness show'd, Or step'd aside to do my Neighbour good: If e'er to help amongst your Flocks I've come, Or sav'd a Sheep, or brought a Stragler home; Let not those grateful Turns be set at nought, But bear them still, when I am gone, in Thought, And let each grateful Swain recal to Mind, That I have left my nearer self behind; Shew Favour to this dear, this charming Maid, My best belov'd, and Daphnis is o'er pay'd. Or, if the Plain, or rising Hill she tread, Walk thro' the Wood, or shine along the Mead, Or on some flow'ry Bed she take her Rest, Or gently lean upon the Bank, her Breast; Shepherds attend, and keep her safe from Ill, Be ever near her, and be ready still. Time calls away, and Daphnis must remove, Farewel Companions, and adieu—my Love. THE PENSIVE SWAIN. Pastoral III. To Mr. I. Harrison. Attend me Harrison, while I rehearse A pensive Shepherd's Plaints in humble Verse, Begin, my Muse! whilst Harrison attends, The best good-natur'd Man, and best of Friends; Nor doubt his gen'rous Temper will refuse To smile on thee, for still he loves the Muse. The western Clouds in golden Borders shone, And half in Ocean dip'd, appear'd the Sun; Kind was the Season, and the Evening cool, And all was calm and gay, but Dolon's Soul, A chearless Swain, within a lonely Glade, 'Gainst Silvia's Cruelty he thus inveigh'd; While with his Verse each Grot around him rung, And Hills gave back the Burthen of his Song. Now comes the softest Season of the Year, Delightsome Ev'nings, and a balmy Air; See, beauteous Nature in her Charms arise, Fine flow'ry Fields, and bright indulgent Skies; The Woods shoot out in Leaves, the Grass in Bloom, And tender Zephyrs steal the sweet perfume; The Birds exult, while Hills and Plains reply, And all Things feel the Joys of Love but I. The Sun returning, sheds his genial Beams, And makes the Earth relent, and warms the Streams; And as his vital Influences flow, The joyful Glebe confesses them below; What bloom in Field, in Park, in Wood and Grove, Are all the blissful Progeny of Love. The happy Time is known in Earth and Skie, And all Things feel the Joys of Love but I. The Honey-suckle round the Hawthorn twines, The Hawthorn with the Honey-suckle joyns: While on the Bud the am'rous Zephyr Blows, It heaves and swells, and bursts into a Rose, And as it bursts, a Flood of Fragrance flows. The blooming Groves a flowry Gleam display, That adds unto the Brightness of the Day; While those to these, in balmy Breezes sigh, And all Things feel the Joys of Love but I. The little Birds, in Pairs and am'rous Play, Court thro' the Wood, or bill upon the Spray. See, perch'd on high, there sits the Turtle Dove, And spreads his Plumes and cooes about his Love; While she with all the Softness of a Bride, Melts to his Song, and leans against his Side. All Nature seems in Scenes of Love to vie, And all Things feel it's blissful Joys but I. And must I still this lonely Thing remain, Condemn'd forever to implore in Vain? Ah cruel Silvia! can there nought remove Thy settled Scorn, and bend thy Heart to love? What is my Crime, O fair Relentless! tell; Whose greatest Fault is loving thee too well? If that's a Fault, dear Silvia! tell me why? For all Things feel the Joys of Love but I. While I consume amidst thy Frowns and Scorn, There nothing pleases, Ev'ning, Noon, or Morn; Nor all the Meads, nor all their balmy Stores, Nor Groves, tho' fill'd with Musick and with Flow'rs; In vain their Fragrance, Zephyrs breathe in vain, They cannot cure, or sooth a Lover's Pain; There nought delights my Smell, my Ear, or Eye, While all Things feel the Joys of Love but I. But should'st thou smile, all Nature wou'd revive, To Dolon's Soul, and doubly be alive; In sweeter Notes the warbling Choir would sing, The Spring grow fairer, and be more than Spring. A fresher Spirit all the World improve, And all Things rise in Bliss, in Life, and Love. Then come my Silvia, to my Breast come nigh! For all Things feel the Joys of Love but I. What holds my Dear from coming to these Arms? What Pow'r ill-fated, still detains thy Charms? Come, bring one Glance of thy deluding Eyes, For while thou stay'st, thy wretched Dolon dies! Ah! wilt thou triumph in my latest Breath, Can Pleasure find thee in a Lover's Death? If so, to please her, Heavens, let me die! And all Things feel the Joys of Love but I. Thus sung the pensive Swain his mournful Lay, Here ceas'd his Song, and with his Song, the Day. THE COMPLAINT. Pastoral IV. To Mr. T. Strickland. As down-cast Thyrsis, hapless in his Love, Lean'd o'er a Stream which scarce appear'd to move; And view'd the fading Beauties of his Face, Within the Mirrour of the liquid Glass. In the deep Anguish of his Heart he mourn'd, And Rocks, and Woods, and Hills, his Voice return'd. While Autumn-Zephyrs, bade the Flow'rs to fade, Breath'd deadness o'er the Grass and brown'd the Shade, The wither'd Verdures scatter'd from the Wood, And floated slowly down the silent Flood. Thou, whom the Muses with their Art inspire, Soft melting Numbers, and a flowing Fire; Whose Wit not strikes us with a short-liv'd Flame, But always Charms, and always is the same. Hark, while the Muse rehearses Thyrsis' Song, Which thus in wailing Accents left his Tongue. Alas, sad Youth! how art thou chang'd of late, Too near Resemblance of thy wretched Fate! Oft o'er this Brook have I those Features seen, Bloom in full Youth, and pleasant Smile the Mein; A chearful Gladness dawn'd within these Eyes, And that same Brow serene as cloudless Skies; Ah me! my Blowsabella then was kind, Nor fear'd my Heart, nor jealous was my Mind. But since the Nymph, unjust, and faithless grown, Gave Strephon, what is due to me alone; Forlorn, forsaken, by the perjur'd Maid, My bloom decays, and Youth begins to fade: Dull Melancholy sits upon my Face, Lowrs in my Brow, and blots out ev'ry Grace; My charming Blowsabella turns unkind, Grief wrings my Heart, and bitter sinks my Mind. Once I with Blowsabella spent my Days, Or told her Tales, or charm'd her with my Lays; With Rapture on her Shepherd's Arm she hung, And Swains all list'ning crouded to my Song; Rapt to the Heart, their nimble Feet were seen, To shift in sprightly Dance, and trip the Green; Pleas'd with my Numbers, ev'n the ancient gaz'd, And heard with Wonder, and with Rapture prais'd. Then each new Day was pleasant to my View, My Heart all blest, nor what was tedious knew: The golden Minutes smoothly danc'd away, Nor thought I they were long, nor wish'd their Stay; For each new Moment, brought as new delight, Thus Morning slid to Noon, and Noon to Night; By Night I sought not kind repose in Vain, 'Till Morn all pleasant brought the Day again. But now forlorn I solitary rove, And lonely seek some unfrequented Grove; Where 'midst a Wood obscure, or thicken'd Shade, From Sight of Swains and perjur'd Nymphs convey'd, I teach the Flute, or rural Reed to mourn, And give the Notes a strange unusual turn; The cruel Ragings of my Mind to ease, But all in vain, not Musick's self can please. Dull Time appears with lagging Wings to speed, And the slow Sun moves idly o'er my Head; Nor Morn, nor Noon, nor soft approach of Night, Assuage my Grief, or pleasing Rest invite. A Moment seems an Hour, an Hour a Day; Each Day a tedious tiresome Week to stay; Each Week the length of any Month appears; And Months trail on in long continued Years. His Flocks, while Thyrsis tended blithe and gay, Frisk'd o'er the Fields, and wanton'd in their Play; A lovelier Charge, not drove another Swain, Pride of the Hills, and fairest on the Plain; But now neglected, they unheeded bleat, O'er barren Lawns, nor find fresh Greens to eat; By Briers and Brambles all their Fleeces torn, Hang on the Hedge, and blend amongst the Thorn. See Nature's self appears to joyn my Woe; So fade her Joys, her Beauties vanish so; Left by the Sun, his Absence she deplores, Nor keeps her Greens alive, nor chears her Flow'rs; Yet Phœbus will return again, and bring, A blissful Season, and renew the Spring: But Blowsabella will no more return, And Thyrsis must an endless Winter mourn. Alas! to Hills and Mountains I complain; Yet not to Hills and Mountains, all in vain; Tho' these are Senseless, they shall hear my Song, And Woods and Rocks stand Judges of my Wrong; The Woods were call'd to witness to our Love; And solemn Vows were made in ev'ry Grove; Nor Woods and Groves record our Loves alone, Our Vows and Promises to Heav'n are known; And tho' false Blowsabella's Mem'ry fail, So does not Heav'n, but Heav'n remembers all. Nor think, O Strephon, that thy wealthy Store, Which brib'd a Nymph to break those Oaths she swore, Which made thee happy at another's Cost, And only bought that Blessing which I lost Can bribe the Pow'r which weighs our Deeds above, To be unjust, or pardon perjur'd Love: If Peace thou seek'st, be just to Mortals here, And dread just Heav'n, and future Anguish fear. Thus Thyrsis plain'd, but now began to lowr, The thicken'd Air, and labour'd with a Show'r, To shun th' impending Cloud, he sped away, And ceas'd, the mournful Echoes of his Lay. FRIENDSHIP. Pastoral V. To Mr. P. Tyzack. Two youthful Swains, in silvan Shades retir'd, Both Friendship warm'd, and both the Muse inspir'd, Long Time had Damon, Strephon's absence born, As long had Strephon languish'd to return: Both lately met, their Friendship they rehearse, In rural Song, and in alternate Verse. To thee, dear TYZACK I repeat their Lays, More fond of thy Esteem, than publick Praise. When Friendship is the Theme that I pursue, The Theme and Song are both to TYZACK due; And if this Verse he judges not in vain, Then all the Bays are mine, I seek to gain. Damon. What Joy, what Pleasure now revives to me! Since I once more have found (dear Strephon!) thee; In ev'ry Shade a new Delight appears, And ev'ry flow'ry Field new Beauties wears; Fresh dawns of Life my ravish'd Bosom knows, While all Things a new Heav'n of Joy disclose. Strephon. How much was I, to leave the Country, crost! I daily languish'd for the Plains I lost; Yet ev'n the Plains no Pleasure give to me, Except I tend the bleating Flocks with thee: But ev'ry Place has Charms, if Damon's there, And Joy and Pleasure bloom thro' all the Year. Damon. What Shepherd knows not that I love to play On various Reeds, and waste in Songs the Day? For while with thee, no Summer-day was known, But Musick welcom'd and adieu'd the Sun. But since from thee in lonely Fields I stray'd, No Songs were sung, nor rural Pipes were play'd. Strephon. Oft have I sat, and listen'd to thy Song, Nor thought I once, the pleasing Time was long; As oft the Musick of thy Pipe has held Me charm'd, unable to forsake the Field; But since I knew no blithsome Damon near, No Song has pleas'd, nor Pipe has charm'd mine Ear. Damon. A hill there is, to ev'ry Shepherd known, Where Trees arise, and Streams fall purling down; 'Twas all Delight and Pleasure, while with thee, I trac'd its flowery Banks from Tree to Tree; But since you left me, stript of all, it seems; Nor Trees Delight, nor please, the purling Streams. Strephon. Oft, as I walk'd the Town, and cast mine Eyes Where proud Augusta's glitt'ring Turrets rise; I sigh'd, and softly said, I'd rather see An homely Cottage, or a shady Tree, Than all the Pomp, Augusta's Turrets wear, They're all a Torment, Damon is not here. Damon. How rich the Feast did seem, nay more than seem When Strawb'rries roll'd in plentious Cups of Cream. What merry Hours each Winter Ev'ning blest, When Nuts were crack'd, with many a witty Jest! Depriv'd of Strephon, I'm depriv'd of these, Nor Nuts, nor witty Jests, nor Berries please. Strephon. In Stalls, when I have seen the Basket bear The Russet-Apple, or the Gold-Knop-Pear: My Thoughts have then recall'd, how oft with you, I found these grateful in the Place they grew; But since with Damon I was blest no more, I tasted these, but found them mean and sour. Damon. And wilt thou take the Shepherd's Crook again, And tend on Flocks, and leave no more the Plain? If so, let surly Hylas boast to keep, Of Goats, four hundred, and a thousand Sheep: I envy not the Wealth, his Pastures bear, But blest with Strephon, I am happier far. Strephon. Believe me, Damon, I will leave no more, These Fields, so known, so lov'd by me before, Bright golden Days of Joy, devolve again, And Scenes of long Delight, if Life remain; Since I once more have found these Shades and you, I gladly bid the busy World adieu. Damon. Then shall these Hills again repeat my Lays, And Rocks give back the Tune, as Damon plays. Bright Summer Suns shall chear my Heart again, And Harvests bless me with their ripen'd Grain Forlorn, from Strephon, these no more can please, But bless'd with him, I then enjoy all these. Strephon. Begin then Damon, raise the tuneful Strain, And call the Mountain-Shepherds to the Plain; The Plain shall with the grateful Notes rejoice, And Woods repeat, and Mountains join the Voice, The Voice this welcome News to Swains shall bring, 'Tis Damon's Song, and Strephon hears him sing. THE LETTER. Pastoral VI. There is a Rock, whose solitary Brow, Is dark with melancholly Shades of Yew; Thro' these, the Winds in hollow murmurs blow, And beat, with solemn Sounds, the Caves below. Fit Place for Contemplation, or for Care, To lift the Soul, or pour out sad Despair! And here lay Collin, hapless Swain! alone, And scribled out this Letter on a Stone. “O charming Nymph, whom once I durst call mine, “When thou as fondly nam'd me to be thine; “And tho' no more for mine thou shalt be known, “Yet I will still be thine, and thine alone; “And, faithless Woman! tho' I speak in vain, “And sigh to Winds, yet will I still complain; “The Winds to Woods, my sad Complaints shall bear, “And ev'ry Grot thy perjur'd Faith shall hear; “Ev'n flinty Rocks shall softly join my Moan, “And Streams, my Plaints remurmur, as they run. “O cruel, fair, perfidious Charmer, say! “What Object steals thy wand'ring Heart away? “O say what happier Lover now enjoys “Thy faithless Breast, and fills thy fraudful Eyes! “Of what superior Charms is he possest, “That Colin's fall is doom'd, to make him blest? “Is he more fond, more passionate than I? “Or can he finer Charms in thee descry? “Does he new Views of beauteous Scenes explore, “Unknown, unfelt, by Colin's Soul before? “Else, what so far your fickle Mind could move, “To break all Vows, and violate all Love? “Ah me! what Pangs thro' all my vitals dart! “Oh! I could tear my fond believing Heart! “That thought you'd still be soft, and kind, and true, “Nor fear'd to find a perjur'd Soul in you; “Such tender looks and dear deluding Mein, “Bespoke you all an Angel's Truth within. “Can you forget that tender Time now past? “When round my Neck your circling Arms you cast, “When (touch'd with something that foretold my Pain) “My Heart the heavy Grief could scarce sustain; “Your melting Words subdu'd my rising Fears, “And your deluding Kisses stop'd my Tears; “With promis'd Faith you charm'd me into Joy, “Ah then I thought no Swain so blest as I! “But O the dismal Change! my Joys are fled, “And sullen, now I wander thro' the Glade. “In vain, each friendly Shepherd would divert, “With Songs, the sad Disorder of my Heart; “Without Delight, their tuneful Lays I hear, “The warbling Flute as idly strikes mine Ear; “Ev'n joyless rise the Verdures of the Plain, “And Roses blow, and Lillies spring in vain: “From Songs, from Flowers, and ev'ry Thing to bless, “I sickly fly, and seek this lone Recess; “Where rocky Caverns, frightful yawn around, “And Shades combining, darken all the Ground. “Forever here, forsaken, I'll complain, “Tho' all my Wailings and my Moans be vain; “For ne'er another Mistress can remove “My Heart from you, or change my faithful Love. “For you, I all the Sex besides forgo, “Tho' by that Deed I run on certain woe: “And never shall my Mem'ry lose that Time, “When clasp'd within your Arms, and you in mine, “I took the last adieu, and all my Breast, “Throbs, Thrillings, Pangs, and Agonies possest; “My Heart destracted 'midst a thousand Fears, “Swell'd to my Eyes, and melted out in Tears; “My trembling Limbs could scarce my Weight sustain, “And Life surpriz'd, stood pausing with the Pain. “Think then, O False! how in that sad adieu, “You grasp'd with me, and promis'd to be true! “Heav'n heard your Vows, as from your Lips they past, “And Heav'n will certainly be just at last. ABSENCE. Pastoral VII. Extracted from the Canticles. ? Paulò majora canamus. Virg. Ec. 4. Begin my rural Muse a loftier Strain, Sublimer lift the Musick of the Plain; The Theme commands. I sing the Spouse (of old, In Song inspir'd, and sacred Numbers told.) All plaintive laid in Sharon's flow'ry Grove, Thus moan'd in Absence, and proclaim'd her love: And as she mourn'd, the Winds forgot to blow, The Birds to warble, and the Streams to flow: All Nature hush'd, and all Attention grown, Repeated not one Echoe of it's own; But catching at the soft dejected Song, Responds aloud these Words of Sponsa's Tongue. C. 2. v 10.How long delightless, must I mourn thy Stay, Relieve my Pains, arise, and come away. C. 2. v 11, 12, 13.Behold, the bleaky Time of Winter's past, Nor darksome Clouds the troubl'd Skies o'ercast: Th' indulgent Season shows the youthful Year, And gives a warmer Breeze, and sweeter Air; The Fields begin to shine in Bloom again, And Birds exult, and dawning Bliss proclaim, All Nature ravish'd, seems with Joy to sing, And hail the sweet return of flow'ry Spring: In ev'ry wavy Wood, and shady Grove, We hear an am'rous Turtle court his Love; In mutt'ring Notes he pays his melting Vows, And bills his Mate, who answers him in Cooes. The Fig-Trees here a wealthy Load display, The waxing Fruit enlarges ev'ry Day: And there, the Grapes in luscious Clusters swell. Their sweet Effluvia waft a grateful Smell. How long delightless, must I mourn thy Stay? Relieve my Pains, arise, and come away: While thou art absent, ev'ry Thing to please, Not once enlivens Health, but turns Disease. All Day in sad and solemn Tears I mourn, And wish (I know not why) for Night's return. C 3. v 1.By Night, kind Rest, and Sleep's embraces fled, And weary with my solitary Bed, I rise, and walk the Melancholy gloom, (Sad as my Soul, and chearless as my Doom) There seek thy Face, and ev'ry Place explore Where I have known thy Company before: In what Recess, obscurely dost thou lie? I call aloud, but empty Winds reply. How long delightless, must I mourn thy stay? Relieve my Pains, arise, and come away. O might these fragrant Scenes, so lov'd by thee, Invite thee to return, so lov'd by me! C. 4. v 16.Ye Winds, to leave the North, your Pinions try, And from the softer South in Whispers fly; Come breathe along these Gardens, Groves, and Greens, And bathe each flow'ry Plant in od'rous Streams; Ye balmy Gales of Air, ye Zephyrs blow! And court the Floods of mellow'd Spice to flow; That he, my chiefest Joy, may deign to come, To taste the Fruit, and smell the fragrant Bloom: The ripen'd Juices shall invite his Taste, Prolong his Stay, and make his Sponsa blest. O thou the dearest of my tendrest Part, Pride of my Soul, and Glory of my Heart! How long delightless, must I mourn thy stay? Relieve my Pains, arise, and come away. Ah! When shall I again thy Presence find, More lovely, and more lov'd, than all Mankind? C. 2. v 3. As barren, worthless Forest-trees appear, When the full golden Apple-tree is near. Such, looks the Herd of all Mankind to me, And such the fairest Youths, compar'd with thee. C. 5. v 15.Not Lebanon, with Cedars cover'd o'er, In great exalted Beauties, charms us more; And yet in thee, the mildest Glories shine, C. 5. v 12.Nor has the Dove a kinder Eye than thine. Such thou, the Feeder of my tender Fires, The sacred Object of my Soul's desires! How long delightless, must I mourn thy Stay? Relieve my Pains, arise, and come away. C. 2. v 3. While I with thee enjoy'd the breezy Shade, And tufted Greens, and Flow'rs adorn'd the Bed: On golden Boughs was cluster'd mellow'd-Fruit, That bow'd the Branch, and glow'd beneath the Shoot: O pleasant Fruit of more than mortal Taste! O Feast cœlestial! O divine Repast! C. 8. v 6.Let me forever on thy Bosom rest, Stamp'd on thy Heart, and seal'd within thy Breast! There nothing can destroy what Love inspires; Nor Waves, nor Floods can quench th' eternal Fires: Love knows no Age, but full immortal Prime, Nor waxes feebler in th' immense of Time; I feel it here, O come! my Vitals stay, Or else I faint, or else I die away. C. 2. v 5.O stay my Spirits with cœlestial Wine, And give the Comforts of thy Fruit divine! From my faint Heart this pressing Care remove, And raise my Soul that sickly sinks in Love! How long delightless, must I mourn thy stay? Relieve my Pains, arise, and come away. C 2. v 8, &amp; 9.Ah! sure his Voice I hear, or else I dream; It must be his, for none can mimick him. See, where he comes! not swifter flies the Hind; Skim back, the Hills; and Mountains roul behind. No more delightless, shall I mourn his stay, My Pains are now reliev'd, he comes away. COUNTRY-LIFE. An Eclogue. To Mr. Rotheram. Tantus amor terræ ? Virg. To you, whose Mind with ev'ry Art's endow'd, Learn'd, and polite, and wise, and just, and good; Not only form'd t'instruct us, both to please, With Strength to vanquish, or to charm with Ease. To you, the Muse, ambitious in her Choice, Lifts up her rural Song, and tunes her Voice; And if you deign a friendly Smile to show, In tenui labor, at tenuis non gloria. Virg.Tho' low my Verse, my Glory is not so. The happy Swain, who lives on homely Fare, Serene his Days, and quiet is his Care. Tho' hid from Fame, yet he's remote from Strife, Feels all the Blessings, and the Joys of Life; Gluts not on Feasts, nor Nods, o'er Fumes of Wine, But drinks the gen'rous Tribute of his Kine; Cœna brevis juvat. ? Hor.Or temp'rate feeds on Meat and eats the Bread, His Hands did sow, and his own Closes fed: Pleas'd with the Plenty Providence has sent, He thanks the Pow'rs above, and is content. His Limbs repose not on the downy Bed, Nor painted Figures shine above his Head; But nightly Rest in lowly Cots he takes, Unbroke his Slumbers, and serene he wakes, When the bright Day-Star, by Aurora driven, Flames thro' the Concave of the eastern Heav'n; The feather'd Songsters fill the morning Skies, With echoing Notes, and call the Swain to rise; With Pleasure he observes the joyful Sound, And leaves his rural Shed, and walks his Ground; Prospectat errantes greges. ? Hor.Here he beholds his spacious Oxen feed; And there his Kine are grazing on the Mead; And here his fleecy Flocks command his Eye; He sees, and as he sees, exults with Joy; While Herbs, or Flow'rs, or Fruit, his Sense regale, With balmy Airs, that leave him strong and hale: This makes his daily Labours pass with ease, And ev'n the worst of rural Hardships please. In verdant Fields he cheats his Time away, On Wings more bright, more sweet, more soft than they. Each Day, new Beauties charm his wond'ring Sight, And each new Beauty gives as new Delight; In Spring he views the blended Glories rise, Which ev'ry Day more blended strike his Eyes, The Summer-Sun the rip'ning Fruit displays, And paints the various Fruit as various ways. Delicious Autumn finds a rich repast, And various Pleasure gives, in various Taste. Nor Winter's self's to scenes of Pleasure lost, But varies Charms in various Works of Frost. Now with his Plough he turns the furrow'd Land, Or throws the future Harvest from his Hand: Inutilesq; falce ramos amputans. Feliciores inserit: Hor.Or prunes his Trees, or teaches Grafts to grow, And bids the Crab with golden Apples glow: Ev'n aged Trees which scarce alive remain, His skilful Hand renews to Life again; New Ranks of Boughs he teaches them to wear, And be once more the Glory of the Year. And now he cuts the Honours of the Plain, And gath'ring in his Loads of ripen'd Grain, He joys to see his Labour back has told, Or thirty, sixty, or an hundred Fold. Ut gaudet insitiva decerpens pyra, Idem.And now he shakes the bending Trees, which bear The reden'd Apple, and the mellow'd Pear. Aut pressa puris mella condit amphoris. Idem.Or takes his Bees, and from the wealthy Dome, Bears Floods of Honey in the golden Comb. Hinc anni labor. Virg. Thus joyful come his Days, and calmly go, And what's his Labour's his Diversion too; Whilst unperceiv'd, old Age comes gently on, He lives unenvy'd, and he envies none: When Death draws near, he joyful meets his Doom, Nor dreads a sep'rate State in Worlds to come. O happy Life! Aureus hanc vitam in terris Saturnus agebat. Idem. such blissful Years were told, When Time slid o'er on easy Wings of Gold: Ere yellow Metal learn'd in Fires to flow, Or flaming Stones were taught in Crowns to glow: When faithful Pairs in Grottos told their Loves, And Shades gave Laws, and Courts were held in Groves. Hail happy Hills and Plains! you still appear The same, and yet the golden Age is here. Me vero primùm dulces ante omnia Musæ, Quarum sacra fero ingenti perculsus amore, Accipiant. Idem. The sacred Muses, who my Soul inspire, With pleasing Dreams and sweet poetick Fire, Invite my Genius to your rural Scenes, And warm my Breast in Views of bow'ry Greens. Methinks I'm laid upon the spangled Ground, And Zephirs waft, and Fragrance breathes around. Here while beneath the spreading Pine I lie, And Raptures, warm from Nature's Hand enjoy; I envy not the Great their Pomp and Show, While Flatt'rers Praise, and Vulgar gaze below: Nor with the Merchant would I risque my Peace Expos'd to Tempests and the dang'rous Seas. O give me Shades, and let me live retir'd, Where Truth's belov'd, and Virtue is admir'd! ? Et nescia sallere vita. Virg.Where Hearts are honest, Innocence is pure, And smiling Health and Peace repose secure! No anxious Thoughts shall there my Hours molest, Or vexing Cares sit heavy on my Breast: Nor midnight Revels call abroad my Soul, To sate in Cups, or swill the mad'ning Bowl. While raptur'd on the flow'ry Bank I lie, And o'er the Works of Nature cast mine Eye; Unnumber'd Beauties there my Soul shall find, And from them paint their Author to my Mind: Here Meadows clad in green, there shady Bow'rs, Here glow the Blossoms, and there spread the Flow'rs; Here Trees and Hedges compass in the Field, And there large Woods a pleasing Prospect yield. ? Ego laudo ruris amani. Rivos &amp; musce circumlita saxa, nemusque. Hor.Nor will the lone Recess, the solemn Grot, Or please me less, or less improve my Thought: There seated silent on a rugged Stone, Shagg'd o'er with Heath, and thick with Moss o'er grown, Where shatter'd Rocks an awful Scene compose, And darksome Hollies wave upon their Brows; Fontesque lymphis obstrepunt manantibus. Idem.Where chrystal Streams from bubbling Fountains flow Fall tinkling down the Hills, and purl below: Pleas'd with the Prospect, I shall sit serene, View the grey Craggs, brown Hills, and Mountains green; And as each Object strikes upon mine Eyes, My Soul shall swell, my Contemplations rise: Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere Causas. Virg.Or backward from th' Effect, explore the Cause, Or praise the Pow'r, which gave the World it's Laws; Why Springs are found upon the barren Hill, From Cliffs of Rocks, why gliding Streams distil; Why Sops of Mist which gather from the Plain, And climb the Hills, should promise Drops of Rain; Why Clouds should flit on high, or roll below; And what it is that paints the various Bow. Why Morning grey, and Ev'ning streak'd with red, Should tell the Swain fair Weather will succeed. Whence Thunder breeds, why labours in the Skie, Whence breaks the Roar, and whence the Lightnings fly. And why the Sun, or short, or longer shines, And why the Seasons change as he declines. Or why the Moon should gild the Shades of Night, With shining Horns, or a full Orb of Light; Why liquid Streams the Pow'r of Frost obey, Or Ice before the Fire should melt away. When in these Searches should my Soul be tost, And in the pleasing Labyrinths be lost; Thence should she learn her own Defects to know, And whence the Joys of her Existence flow: The wond'rous Source should teach her to admire, Enlarge her Thoughts, and lift the Muse's Fire; The rapt'rous Ken should bid my Numbers rise, And leave the Earth, and range above the Skies. ŒNONE to PARIS. A Pastoral Epistle; Paraphras'd from OVID. The Argument. Hecuba (the Wife of Priam King of Troy) being with Child (afterwards call'd Paris) dreamed she was deliver'd of a Firebrand: Priam consulting the Oracle thereupon, was answer'd, The Child should be the Cause of the Destruction of Troy; wherefore Priam commanded it should be deliver'd to wild Beasts assoon as born; but Hecuba, (mov'd with the natural Affection of a Mother for her Infant) to evade the barbarous Execution of this Order, got Paris privately convey'd to Mount Ida, there to be secretly foster'd by the Shepherds, where, when he was grown up, he fell in Love with the Nymph OEnone. But an Apple being presented to the Goddesses Juno, Pallas, and Venus, bearing this Inscription, Detur pulchriori, (Let it be given to the fairest,) and a Contest thereupon arising, Jupiter appoints Paris for an Umpire to decide the Controversy: Each of the Goddesses therefore tempts him into her Favour by a promis'd Reward; Juno offers him Empire, Pallas Wisdom, and Venus the Enjoyment of the most beautiful Woman. The last won his Voice; and soon after being known and own'd for King Priam's Son, he sails into Greece, falls in Love with Helen, the Wife of King Menelaus, and carries her to Troy. OEnone hearing this, and raving to be so abandon'd and deceiv'd, writes the following Epistle to him, in which she Expresses a great Variety and Struggle of Passions. No injur'd Prince, his Vengeance here proclaims; But a weak Nymph of broken Vows complains. Then safely read; or claims your Grecian Fair, As all your Love, so all your Time and Care? Unhappy Change! and can such Baseness wait On noble Minds? O curse of being great! There was a Time when Paris' self was known A lovely Swain, whom I durst call my own. There was a Time when I an harmless Maid, He prest me to his Breast, and sigh'd and said, “How long, my charming Nymph! must Paris burn, “In ardent Love for you, without return? “Hence let my Tongue no more of you complain, “The truest Lover, make the happiest Swain. “Feel here my Heart, what throbbing beats my Breast, “Look on my Eyes, and there my Flame's confest: “Thro' ev'ry Vein the swift Destruction flies, “O yield OEnone, or your Paris dies! Won with your Words, and gazing on your Charms, I blush'd, and sigh'd, and dropt into your Arms. Ah, then no fatal Pomp around you shone, Nor known to be the mighty Priam's Son: But o'er the Lawn, an exile Shepherd stray'd, And I a fam'd and celebrated Maid; Yet fam'd and celebrated as I was, I met your Love, and stoop'd to your Embrace: And while you sought no other Bed but mine, OEnone saw the golden Hours of Time. In flow'ry Shades we spent the Summer's Day, In pleasing Dalliance, and delightful Play: Or stray'd along the Margin of a Stream, Or laid upon a Bank, and prest the Green: Amidst our Flocks our am'rous Toys exprest, Clasp'd Arm in Arm, and Breast repos'd on Breast; Ev'n Winter's bleaky Months unheeded fled, Nor knew we half the Storms, the Season shed. With you I rose ere Phœbus shot a Ray, To rouse the Stag, and chace the savage Prey: Companion of your Sport, as of your Love, The Deer surpris'd, adown the Hills we drove; Well pleas'd, you smil'd, as in the flying Chace, You heard me name the Hounds, and chear their Race: And when the Game was o'er, you would relate, How well I manag'd, and my Words repeat; How swift I sped along the Forest-green, And as you told, give Kisses in between. On ev'ry stately Tree you carv'd my Name, And cut out Records of your lasting Flame; Each lofty Beech, a Protestation wears, Which still grows larger with the length of Years. Upon the flow'ry Banks of Xanthus grows (Well known for Beauty, and for shady Boughs,) A lofty Popular, may the Tree ne'er fade, Nor be the Trunk by length of Years decay'd; But shoot and flourish in perpetual Bloom, Thro' present Times, and Ages yet to come: For Paris cut these Verses in the Rind, And vow'd he 'grav'd the Copy of his Mind. “When for OEnone, Paris leaves to burn, “The Streams of Xanthus to their Source shall turn. Now turn ye Streams, thou Xanthus, backwards flow! His Faith is perjur'd, and destroy'd his vow. O rather, lovely Youth! return again, Come sooth my woes, and mitigate my pain! Nay, sooner Xanthus will revolve his Course, And roll his Streamlets backwards to their Sourse. Sure never Innocence or Love like mine, Met such Delusion and Deceit as thine! Nor know I justly where to cast the blame; On Venus, or on Paris to complain: 'Twas she first sought our Blisses to divide, And you, false Youth! too easily comply'd. And can a heav'nly Pow'r so cruel be? Or can the tender Queen of Love be she? Where shall the Gods for Justice be rever'd, If Innocence be doom'd to this Reward? Within our Breasts a mutual Rapture sprung, And Love was always sweet, and always young: Our Nights all Joy, indulgent ev'ry Day, Each Moment smil'd, each Minute danc'd away. When from the bright celestial Thrones above, Minerva, Venus, and the Spouse of Jove, Together naked; left the blest Abodes, Prefering Paris to th' immortal Gods: When all unveil'd, their Beauties met your view, The Prize contended, to be fix'd by you; Not Wit, nor Empire, could invite your Choice, But the fair Grecian Lady won your Voice. When this you told, a sudden Horrour ran Thro' all my Blood, and thrill'd in ev'ry Vein, As sudden, Paleness did my Cheeks surprize, And Floods of Tears stood trembling in my Eyes; The dire Portents, how much I had to grieve, What Woes to suffer, and what Days to live. You stood and gaz'd, nor Words had I to speak, While the pale Roses faded from my Cheek: Then full of Love, you snatch'd me to your Breast, And sigh'd, and thousand tender Things exprest; Then swore by Jove, and ev'ry Power above, Nor Fate, nor Time, should once divide our Love. Sooth'd by the pleasing Musick of your Tongue, All ravish'd, to your panting Breast I clung. But soon my Bliss on hasty Wing I view'd; Again it fled, no more to be renew'd: When envious Fame your high Descent made known, And to the World proclaim'd you Priam's Son. From Groves, and Plains, and Grottos, you retir'd, In Courts and Palaces to be admir'd; And soon in Courts and Palaces were taught, To break your Vows, and set your Oaths at nought, And all the Truth and Honesty, we priz'd In Groves, and Plains, and Grottos, you despis'd. For now a Fleet of Ships at Anchor ride, Bound in the Bay, and wanton with the Tide; These wait the Gale, my Paris to convey, O'er curling Surges, and a length of Sea. O charming Youth! how then you seem'd to grieve, When of your weeping Love, you took your Leave; When on each Breast, did I, did you, incline, You wept, I wept, you mixt your Tears with mine. Nor be asham'd that then you shed a Tear, OEnone lov'd, or griev'd to part from her; Your Passion then was spotless as your Fame, Not such a Love you bear the Grecian Dame: About my Neck your circling Arms you threw, As Vines on Elms, about my Neck they grew: Whatever melting Grief could do, you did; Whatever tender Love could say, you said; You wept, and kist, and swore eternal Truth, And call'd all Heav'n a Witness, perjur'd Youth! How then you feign'd a Tempest on the Sea, To lengthen Time, and spin your Stay with me; You fancy'd Storms inclement, swept the Skie, Which none could see but you, nor feel but I; The Sailors smil'd the dear Deceit to View; For all was calm, and scarce a Zephir blew: 'Till often call'd, and 'sham'd so long to stay, You wrench'd aside, and tore yourself away: Gods! at that Moment what my Heart sustain'd, How sad, how griev'd, how agoniz'd, how pain'd! I stood, a marble Statue, in my Woe, Nor could I speak, nor Tears had Pow'r to flow; But while mine Eyes your Gally kept in view, To grieve and gaze was all that I could do; 'Till ply'd with Oars, and shot before the Wind, You disappear'd, and left my Sight behind; Yet still o'er swelling Seas and widen'd Main, My Eyes pursu'd you, but pursu'd in vain. Now drown'd in Tears I fall upon the Shore, And all th' immortal Pow'rs of Heav'n implore, That prosp'rous Breezes and indulgent Gales, May gently heave you on, and swell your Sails, And kindly o'er the rising Surges born, You soon and safely to my Arms return. My Pray'r was heard, but some indignant God, Rejected half, and half my Pray'r bestow'd; For soon your Gally measur'd back the Sea, And you return'd, but not return'd to me. A rugged Rock there is, whose awful Brow Nods from the Skie, and shades the Deep below; Against whose Sides, the justling Billows meet, And break, and roar, and tumble at it's Feet; This craggy Steep I daily us'd to climb, While you were absent, to beguile the Time; There mark the Track, you steer'd along the Main, Or point what Place you must appear again. My Eyes ran all th' expanded Prospect o'er, Joyn'd Land to Land, and measur'd Shore to Shore. At last, a Vessel rising to my View, Revives old Transports, and solicits new. Soft flutt'ring Pangs around my Bosom rove, And my fond Soul springs full of you and Love. Swift o'er the Waves, it leaves the Seas behind, Spread full the Sails, and belly'd with the Wind: When lo, as nearer to my Sight it drew, A gawdy Scene of Splendour struck my view! The Stern and Poop with gold and Silver glow, And shed long Gleams upon the Deep below: The Cords and Shrouds in figur'd Colours shone, And flutt'ring Pendants glitter'd in the Sun. But on the Deck, the Fate of all appear'd, What my Heart boded, and my Bosom fear'd: Stretch'd o'er, a Canopy that flam'd with Gold, And golden Carpets lay beneath unrol'd; There sat, in stately Pomp, the Grecian Queen, Deluding smil'd, and languish'd in her Mein; Her purple Dress flew loose with graceful Pride, And a bright Azure stream'd on ev'ry Side: Upon her Breast th' enamour'd Paris lay, And raptur'd, sunk, and softly dy'd away; While wanton, she his Bosom trifled bare, Or dally'd with the Ringlets of his Hair. Stung with the View, and maden'd at the Deed, I furious, tore the Tresses from my Head; Wild, down the rugged Precipice I ran, And publish'd my Disorder o'er the Plain, The Rocks and Caverns doubl'd to my Cries, And all Mount Ida clamour'd with my Voice; O Paris, faithless Paris! loud I cry'd, O Paris, faithless Paris! they reply'd. Soon as that lovely Name, forever dear! Return'd in wand'ring Echoes on my Ear; My Rage abated, but not so my Grief, O sad Distraction! Pain beyond Belief! All bath'd in Tears, I sought the Shades and Groves, The conscious Witnesses of all our Loves; There mark'd the Places, where my Paris stray'd, And kist the Grove, and wept within the Shade; Then fell upon the Turf, which oft we prest, There wept again, and sigh'd, and mourn'd, and kist. Say lovely Youth, for you have still my Heart, Is all in vain, and fruitless ev'ry Art? Will no fresh Spark re-kindle your Desire, Can nothing fan to Life, your ancient Fire? And must I ne'er expect your kind Return, But sigh neglected, and neglected burn? Is Paris deaf to his OEnone's Sighs, And can she ask of him what he denies? O wretched Change, O Perjury abhor'd! And O yet lovely still, and still ador'd! Is this my Fate, and am I then to find, No calmer Pause, nor respite of the Mind; But still the Furies, boundless in their Reign, To spin one long continu'd thread of Pain: Good Heav'n! declare what is my great Offence, Or cease to punish spotless Innocence. I've try'd all Arts my Passion to controul, And still the giddy Tumult of my Soul; But all in vain, no Charm has Strength to bind, In lasting Chains, my wild disorder'd Mind; Soon my weak-guarded Breast is touch'd a-new, And all my Heart is full of Love and you; The fiery Sparks begin to glow again In ev'ry Pulse, and leap in ev'ry Vein. Nor think, O Prince! so mean a Thought of me, That my Heart swells to share a Throne with thee; When with your Love compar'd, my Thoughts despise The Pomp of Courts, and Empire's gawdy Joys: Lay me but nearest to the Man I love, I would not change to be the Wife of Jove. When you a Swain, and trod behind the Plough, I lov'd you then as dear, as much as now; Then, you would press my Hand, and smiling own, My Charms were such as might adorn a Throne: O had you still that lovely Shepherd been, And I remain'd your joyous rural Queen! O had you ne'er of Grecian Beauties heard, Nor wanton Venus' tempting gift prefer'd! Still o'er these Lawns you'd rov'd a blissful Swain, Nor I had Reason, justly to complain; Then, yet your Flute had warbl'd thro' the Shade, And Birds hung list'ning to the Tunes you play'd: For while you watch'd your fleecy Wantons here, And rais'd the various Products of the Year; No Swain like you, could Charm with so much Ease, Nor had that nat'ral Elegance to please; Your Song, your Dance, the Virgins Bosoms fir'd, While Shepherds gaz'd, and envy'd, and admir'd. Alas! your Soul to-greater State was born, Than range the Fields, or pipe beneath a Thorn; And yet more blest those Fields might prove to you, If you the Fate which threatens near, pursue. For think not, Paris! that the Grecian Lord Will stay his Vengeance, or restrain his Sword; Ere long, his Wrongs shall tumult in Alarms, And Troy behold all Greece approach in Arms. Cassandra's Vision I shall still retain, When the warm God-head run in ev'ry Vein; In views of future Times, her Soul was fir'd, And thus she told me what the Pow'r inspir'd. No more OEnone, plough thy fruitless Plain, O'er barren Wilds of Sand thou throw'st thy Grain; For lo! a fatal Hiefer sails from Greece, Which shall destroy thy Hopes, thy Joys, and Peace; Nor only shall thy private Store destroy, But Piram's House, and sink in Flames all Troy. She comes! O righteous Heav'n, her Course restrain, Or drive her back, or plunge her in the Main! She said, and fled, nor yet her Mind was cool, The God kept still Possession in her Soul. I try'd to search the mystick Speech, in vain; But you and Helen now disclose it plain: My Hopes, my Joys, my Peace, are all destroy'd, And Paris in another Bed enjoy'd! Hence, endless Pain and Woe reside with me, For my dear All is fled away in thee. Nor stops the Mischief here, the Gods and Fate, O'er Illion's Towers with red Destruction wait: The Domes are fir'd, the pompous Palace burns, And all the Land in Disolation mourns. This is the Dow'r, the faithless Helen brings, The Fall of Cities and the Blood of Kings: Avert it, perjur'd Paris! and restore The lawless Woman on the Spartan Shore. Return within my peaceful Arms again, Appease the Gods, and quench th' impending Flame. Or if all this appear in your Esteem, The Words of Women, and an idle Dream, Yet can you hope the Grecian Dame will prove, A lasting Passion, and a constant Love? As thine, she once Atrides' Bosom prest, As fondly clasp'd him, and as warmly kist; And as he lies alone, forsaken now, The like new Change of Fortune waits on you. Fair as she is, no steady Soul she knows, For ev'ry new deluding Youth she glows: With ev'ry blooming Object, loves to play, And melt in loose lascivious Trance away. With Theseus, once the lovely Faithless sail'd, And feigning Rage, the Flight a Rape mis-call'd, Who can believe her Honour kept unfoil'd, When Love beat high, and Theseus' Vigour boil'd? Could Theseus with the blushing Wanton play, And let the Moments idly creep away? This, Madness unexampl'd, must believe, Nor can the empty Sound of Rape, deceive; She willing fled with him, as now with thee, And the next Youth shall bear her o'er the Sea. Not thus OEnone set her Heart on you, But burns with constant Love, and keeps her Vow. No plunder'd Beauties to your Arms I brought, But spotless Innocence, in Deed and Thought. My Virgin-Breast, no brutal Wishes mov'd, But tender, melted, bled, ador'd, and lov'd; Nor thought I it a Crime to meet your Arms, And knew you but a Shepherd full of Charms: Yet still there something more than Shepherds know, Shone thro' your Airs, and dwelt upon your Brow; When raptur'd, you the Flow'ry Garland made, And mingl'd Pinks and Dasies in the Braid; Then clasp'd me in your Arms, you'd smiling own, The Head which wore it, well deserv'd a Crown; But while with you in Groves and Shades retir'd, No other Crowns, my ravish'd Breast desir'd. To view these happy Hours approach again, Were worth an Empire, or an Age of Pain! But O that charming Day's forever fled; What Tears I weep, and what I've yet to shed! The circling Hours, in painful Moments fly, Nor sees the Sun, a greater Wretch than I; While I of violated Faith complain, And call on Paris to return, in vain. More light thy Faith, more vain thy empty Vows, Than Leaves which drop in Autumn from the Boughs, Or idle Straws which wand'ring Zephirs bear, Toss to and fro, and trifle in the Air. O Phebus! what avails it me to know The various Plants, their Virtues, where they grow! In vain my Skill, in vain my Searches prove, I cannot find a Cure for raging Love. Not all the Virtues of the flow'ry Plain, Can fix one Faithless, wand'ring Heart, again: Nor thou thy self; the glorious God of Day, Can sooth my Torments, or my Woes Allay. Paris alone enjoys the mighty Pow'r, To cure my Heart, and all my Joys restore. Then fairest, loveliest, dearest Youth! return, Bring Life, and Love, and Day, and Night, and Morn; For curs'd from thee, I none of these enjoy, But sigh, and mourn, and weep, and faint, and die. O come, O snatch you from the Grecian Fair! Ere Troy be plung'd in Flame, in Blood and War; Ere some curs'd Spear, more fatal than the rest, Pierce at thy Heart, and wallow thro' thy Breast. Make haste, forsake your beauteous Fugitive, Be mindful of your Country's Good, and live. A Pastoral ODE. I As DICKY a languishing Swain, Sat pensive alone in a Grove; Thus mournfully told he the Pain, His Heart felt in Absence and Love. Alas how uneasy am I, How lumpish and dull is my Heart! It knows not a Corner of Joy, But sorrows in every Part. II For PEGGY, my fair one, is gone, She's gone, and has left me behind; Where plaintively lying alone, I joyn the sad wispering Wind. Each murmuring Blast that comes near, I fill with soft Notes of my Pain: The Grottos my Murmurings hear, And sadly re-murmur again. III But all is in vain, silly Lad! For PEGGY perceives not thy Moan: She sees not thy Coutenance sad, Nor knows thou art mourning alone. Perhaps now her DICKY's forgot, And a Youth that's more happy than he, Possesses her with a soft Thought, Or clasps in his Arms on his Knee. IV And should it be so, can I blame A Nymph that's so charming as she? She ne'er was design'd for a Swain, So mean, and so wretched as me. Her Form is too lovely and bright, Too much to an Angel refin'd; To stoop to so humble a Wight, Or center so lowly her Mind. V How silly was I, and how wild, To wish for so mighty a Prize! To let my poor Heart be beguil'd, And pant in the Warmth of her Eyes! She suffer'd my Pride to advance, And heard what my Bosom could say; She smil'd, and I dy'd in a Trance; She spoke, and I melted away. VI O had she not been so divine! Or else more severe to her Swain! O had better Fortune been mine! Or else had not I been so vain! Then DICKY perhaps had been blest In a Nymph more befitting his State: Or known no dull Weight on his Breast, Nor mourn'd the hard Laws of his Fate. VII But rapt with his PEGGY, still he Long Days of Delight had enjoy'd; From doubts and from Jealousies free, Nor Absence his Bliss had destroy'd. Alas, ye deluding dear Hours, That slipt in short Moments away, When PEGGY and I blest the Bow'rs, And call'd you and begg'd you to stay! VIII You're gone, and no more will return, And Ages your Places supply; In Moments I find Years to mourn, Tho' Years fled in Moments of Joy. How swiftly can Pleasure bear Time, How shortly flit Ages away! How dully Despair can confine, And clogg a whole Age in a Day!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part II. Miscellaneous POEMS. ? hanc etiam aspice partem. Virg. TO Mr. LANCASTER, Upon his Painting a Prospect of KENDAL-CASTLE. Materiem superabat opus. ? Ovid. Accept the Numbers of a friendly Muse, Nor what your real Merit claims, refuse. Not as a Rival, I attempt to raise This Monument, but found it on your Praise: And were my Lines as easy as your Teint, Or could I write as well as you can Paint; From you, my Verse a lasting Life should claim, And you from me should purchase endless Fame. For many Years, the Structure had been cast In Heaps of Rubbish, and a ruin'd Waste; And scarce the lonely, mould'ring Wall maintains One broken Sketch of old Magnificence: 'Till you by happy Skill redeem'd the Tow'rs, And made the Views of former Ages, ours; Each Turret from it's Ruins rear'd a-new, And all the Building rose again, by you: And we now see (instructed by your Hand) How ancient Times beheld the Castle stand. As o'er the Piece I travel with my Eyes, I find a thousand recent Beauties rise; Now o'er the Hill, I trace the blooming Scenes, And Nature dawns thro' Art, in all her Greens: Now to the Structure I methinks am led, And rising Arches swell above my Head: See, lofty Tow'rs and spacious Columns rise! Shade half the Hill, and proudly keep the Skies: While azure Heav'ns with Light adorn the whole, Or Clouds delude the Sight, and seem to roll. How bold each Stroke, how free the Touches fall, And what a strong Relievo bodies all! Nature her self, may view thy Work and boast, She has receiv'd from thee, and nothing lost. Not Kent (where her delightful Waters flow In limpid Waves, in silent rolls, and slow.) Paints the steep Hill, and in her Bosom bears, Each verdant Plant the rising Summit wears, Nor do those fleecy Images which lie In that ideal Vault, that neither Skie, More lively Figure out these Packs which move, O'er the wide Concave of the Heav'n above, Nor more the Fancy or the Eye incite. Than thy well teinted Shade, and beauteous Light. Thus, while it most delights thee to excel, In painting Images of Nature well, She ready waits to jump at thy Command, And Worlds start out, obedient to thy Hand; But would that Skill which shines so blooming here, Begin Designs more noble to prefer! To teach on Canvas, Majesty to shine, And reconcile our Factions with a Line; To win our Passions over, as we look; And mend our various Errours with a Stroke. Or draw old Contests in a figur'd Strife, Renew past Times, and call the Dead to Life; Thence learn us, present, happy Days to prize, And look on civil Broils with fearful Eyes. Nor shall the Muse be backward then, to raise Thy Name encreasing, and thy growing Praise; To future Times shall she thy Fame prolong, In deathless Verse, if Deathless be my Song. And tho' each Stroke shall fade, thy Skill could give; Still fresh thy Paint, in lasting Strains shall live. EPIGRAM ON AGROPHILOS, An ingenious Husbandman. Fortunate Senex! ? Virg. If there's a Man more happy than the rest, Of Heav'n more favour'd, and more fully blest; More worthy Praise, yet from the Lust more free, More great unknown, Agriphilos is he: Blest in his Fields, which plenteous Crops afford, And blest his Fields, in having such a Lord: Aglaus thus did Gyges wealth excel, And thus did Adam live, before he fell. CELIA Retired. An Ev'ning soft, and balmy Air, And all that's sweet, and fine, and fair, Conspir'd to crown that happy hour, When Celia sought a private Bow'r; Where seated in a Shade alone, She gave the Winds this tender Moan. Ah Damon, why this long Delay, O why art thou so far away! Come near, my Love! if Celia's Charms Have Pow'r to call thee to her Arms. The Season calls us to improve Each happy Hour, in Bliss and Love; For ev'ry Scene that charms the Sight, Is but a Scene of Love's Delight. Each Flow'r displays a Lover's Eye, And ev'ry Zephyr is a Sigh. Each Tree, and Grot, and Bank, and Grove, Cries, Nature has no Law but Love. The little Warblers, that rejoyce, Their Mirth is Love, and Love their Voice. They flit and hop from Bough to Bough, And here they Court, and there they Vow; And now high perch'd on Stems above, They sing, and all the Song is Love. Thrice blest, ye Wood-Inhabitants! As free from Cares, so free from Wants. No rigid Fate your Bliss destroys, Or interrupts your happy Joys. No harsh commanding Parents Tongues, To check your tender Sports or Songs. No tiresome Absence to restrain The Kindlings of your noble Flame. No busy Spies your Hours to grieve, Or kind Appointments to deceive; But all is free, as Wish and Choice, To Love's Commands, and Nature's Voice. O how unlike to you am I! Depriv'd of all my Bliss and Joy, Beset by Danger, check'd by Fear, I sigh for one, I have not here. How long must I in Absence mourn, And wish in vain for his return! Ah Damon, why this long Delay, O why art thou so far away! Come near, my Love! if Celia's Charms Have Power to call thee to her Arms! Let's imitate the Choirs above, In Bliss, and Freedom, Joy, and Love. To the PAINTER of a young Lady's Picture. While you, Sir Artist, are allow'd to thrive, (Whom no right pious Man would wish alive) Divines on Idol-worship may declaim, And urge the Force of sacred Texts, in vain; For while your Pencil so profanely paints, 'Twill make more Sinners, than the Pulpit Saints. To Florinda. Written on her LOOKING-GLASS. Here CUPID learns to Point his Darts, To pierce our Breasts, and wound our Hearts; While you, Florinda, practise here, Or crisp the Coif, or plait the Hair, Or teach th' enchanting Eyes to roll, And shoot yourself into the Soul, Or give the Hood, or Pinners Airs, You furnish CUPID with his Snares: Your flutt'ring Pendents are his Wings, The Plaits his Nests, your Hair his Strings, His Bows your Eye-Brows, and your Eyes Are, each the killing-Dart that flies. THE ROSE. As Silvia was walking one Ev'ning along, The Closes, and Meadows, and Hedges among: A Rose in her Blosom, and under her Feet, Spread all that was pleasant and lovely and sweet. While Damon walk'd by her, her Charms he confest, And Pit-a-pat, Pit-a-pat, beat in his Breast; A Pain full of Pleasure, and rapterous Smart, Took hold of his Bosom, and thrill'd thro' his Heart. Fair FLORA cry'd out (as she smil'd in the Green) “A more charming Creature there never was seen; “So lovely a Blossom's not found in my Store, “With such white and red I ne'er painted a Flow'r, “Ye Pride of the Vallies, ye Beauty of Meads, “Confess her more charming, and bend down your Heads. “Thou Rose in her Bosom, thou Vagrant of mine, “How dar'st thou so bold in that Paradise shine? “Look up to her Cheeks, and confessing, declare “Thy self a faint Sketch of the Life that is there. The Goddess said thus, and the Rose, as was meet, From Silvia's Bosom, dropt down to her Feet. There lay it submissive, nor dar'd to complain; 'Till Damon, in haste, snatch'd the Flower up again; Thrice fondly he kiss'd it, as fondly thrice blest, And welcome to mine (said he) from her dear Breast! Dear Emblem of me, that fell humbly down, The Charms and the Pow'r of her Beauties to own; See, snatch'd from her Breast, how thy Blossoms decay! Just so in her Absence, I languish away. But stay my dear Rose, why so swift wilt thou fly? Together let's live, and together let's die. Damon to Celia. Kind lovely Celia, soft enchanting Fair, More lov'd than Health, than Life itself more dear. Thy tender Lines more Blessings brought to me, Than Spring to Birds, or Lillies to the Bee: The well known Seal awaken'd all my Joys, And e're I broke it loose I kist it thrice; But hasty Love forbidding more delay, Impatient, cry'd, what does my Charmer say? She says a thousand dear enchanting Things, And each a Thousand dear Enchantments brings. My Heart in ev'ry Line, new Raptures move, And ev'ry Syllable's a Soul of Love; No more of tedious Absence I complain, This amply recompenses all my Pain. O dear blest Messenger of tender Joy, Prolong this Bliss, and cheat each Moment by, 'Till that more heav'nly Hour which shall display The Charmer's self, more heav'nly Joys convey; When sunk, beneath a Million Transports prest, Lost in her Charms, I tremble on her Breast, And rapt, when each to each has more to tell, Than Tongue can speak, or Language can reveal. Our bounding Souls t'exchange their Places try, Break thro' each breathe, and issue at each Eye; Each Sigh, each languid Look, discloses more Than Poets feign, or Nat'ralists explore. O matchless Nymph, forever lov'd by me, How much I long that blissful Day to see, When plac'd beneath the Influence of thy Eye, No Foes shall seek to interupt our Joy; Nor Fortune strive by Absence to remove, Our Peace from one continu'd calm of Love. O shining Hour, O lightsome Day of Gold! Spring forth thou Morn, thou Paradise unfold! Alas, the lagging Moments stay behind, Nor Pray'rs can make the sturdy Hours more kind! With Time no soft Entreaties find a Place, Nor laggs he more, nor speeds he more his Pace, Alike regardless, both of Hate and Love, The only Pow'r, nor Gifts, nor Pray'rs can move. But while my Celia, soft, indulgent, shines, And speeds an Intercourse of tender Lines; The melting Joys her dear Impressions bring, Cheat Time's dull Course, and gild his dusky Wing; The tardy Hours more nimbly seem to run; And slides more smooth, each bright succeeding Sun. O charming Celia, ever let me find Your Presence Rapture, and your Absence kind! Support a Life forever fixt your own, That knows no Wishes but for you alone: That likes no Change, nor seeks, but to be true, Nor ever shall acknowledge Love but you. Not all the flow'ry Sex besides, shall bend My steady Purpose from it's destin'd End; No other End, my Thoughts resolv'd, explore, But live with you, or live on Earth no more. On CELIA. Celia the fairest of the female Kind, A Form all faultless, and a spotless Mind; Who views her Eyes, and does not own their Sway? Who hears her speak, and does not melt away? Bright Miracle! from ev'ry Failure free; She is all Charms, all Admiration we. On the same. While Celia sits on Damon's Knee, And gently leans against his Breast, More joy'd, more rapt, more blest is he, Then if he held the wealthy East. Upon her heavenly Frame engrost, Within the compass of an Eye, There's all that's fine the World can boast, Without its Mixtures of Alloy. A charming Form, a gentle Mind, As soft and melting as a Dove; An Heart sincere, a Soul all kind, Both Eyes and Bosom full of Love. Her Speech is all a rapt'rous Song, And all her Looks are Paradise: An Angel flutters on her Tongue, And rides in Triumph from her Eyes. Let haughty Monarchs prize their Thrones, And Victors proud, with Glory burn; I envy not their dazling Suns, Nor for their Pow'r and Greatness mourn. But claspt in Celia's happier Arms, O ever, ever, let me stay! While all my Soul amidst her Charms, Melts softly out, and steals away. THE LAP-DOG. While Minny sports on Silvia's Knee, I wishing view, with Pain I see, The little fav'rite Dog enjoys A Bliss it knows not how to prize. See, smiling Silvia, with what Care, She strokes the Skin, and combs the Hair; She lisps, and fawns, and laughs, and plays, And sports with Minny twenty ways. O how with Envy I'm possest, To see that spotted Brute so blest! Sure Jove might now descend again, But not in Floods of golden Rain: A Minny's Form if he prevail, Must all the Love-sick God conceal. For Minny's the best Creature grown, And has the kindest Favours shown. Securely on her Lap it lies, Or freely gazes on her Eyes; To touch her Breast, may share the Bliss, And unreprov'd, may snatch a Kiss: O Heav'ns, the Joy! who would not be That envy'd Thing, blest Minny, thee? Jove, grant me but what here I crave, No more I'll ask, no more I'll have; Give me a Spell, a potent Charm, To turn my self to Minny's Form. In sportful Dance, and wanton Play On Silvia's Lap I'll spend the Day. But when the Dusk of ev'ning Shade Has call'd her to the downy Bed; Then let me on her Bosom burn, And back again to Damon turn. To DORINDA, Making a Nosegay. While you, Dorinda, cull each fragrant Flow'r, And rob the Garden of it's balmy Store; Or teach the Bloom, obedient to your Hand, In tempting Rows, and posied Ranks to stand; Each shining Range to beauteous Order brought, Expressive Emblem of your lively Thought! Ah lovely Nymph, forget not your own Frame, How much it is, or much appears the same; Tho' you in Charms all flow'ry, bloom to Day, Not Roses brighter, nor the Pink more gay; The Rose in Blossom will not always last, As soon, the Pink will find it's Fragrance waste; Each Flower ungather'd, useless must decay, And all it's fading Glories end in Clay, Not seen, nor smell'd, nor prais'd, nor talk'd of, more; And Flesh is Grass, and Beauty but a Flower. What then remains, but that you well improve The present Time, so form'd for Bliss and Love? While Youth and Pleasure ev'ry Sense invite To melting Joys, and exquisite Delight. O why should you the sweets of Life deny, And those soft Hours of Rapture not enjoy! Embrace the kind Occasion while 'tis here, A happy Spring foretels a happy Year. THE Faded FLOWER. 'Tis hard to say if Beauty's Charms, Bring more of Blessings, or of Harms; So short their Date, so frail their Force, That oft the Blessing turns a Curse. Thyrsis was smit, as once he 'spy'd, A Bed of Lillies in their Pride, He look'd, admir'd, and prais'd, a-while, Then snatch'd the Glories from the Soil, As fondly on his Bosom plac'd, And taught their Charms to grace his Breast But soon the Charms began to fade, And all the flow'ry Glories shed; The Change, no sooner Thyrsis 'spy'd, But with the short Possession cloy'd, The Lillies from his Breast are torn, A Morning pride, an Evening scorn. Thus some flush'd Youth, who feels the Flood Of Fortune, and the Fire of Blood. Upon some Fair-one casts his Eyes, And sees ten Thousand Beauties rise; He pants all o'er, and ev'ry Vein, Glows fiercely, with redoubled Flame; Eternal Truth, he swears, and cries He's slain, and damn'd, if she denies: Mov'd with his Passion, and Complaint, Kind Nature draws her to consent, With soft Reluctance, she complies, Clings to the Bliss, and heaves, and dies; But soon, Enjoyment viels her Charms, No more the Youth, her Beauty warms, But pall'd, he throws her from his Arms Dispis'd and loath'd, her Favours grow, An Angel once, a Strumpet now. The WISH. Might I desire, and Heav'n regard my Voice, And seal my Wish, then hear me make my Choice; Nor would I wish to share an Emp'ror's Name, Nor deal the Bays with eldest Sons of Fame; But O if there's a Blessing stor'd for me, Kind Heav'ns! this mighty Gift then let it be. Celia, the charming Nymph, whom I adore, O give me her, and I will ask no more! AN EPITHALAMIUM. Ye charming Pair, permit your Friend to tell Those Joys, the Muse forbids him to conceal! She sees the Crowd approach on ev'ry Side. To hail the Bridegroom, and acclaim the Bride. Fir'd at the View, she tours above the Throng, And modulates her Raptures into Song: For thee, my Silvius! shall her Numbers rise, To wish thee Health, and long-continued Joys. I saw the Day, and rapt I was to see, When charming Delia gave her Hand to thee; How bright did Phebus o'er the Ocean rise, And fill'd with Light, the Concave of the Skies; The Skies, as mark of Pleasure, deign'd to show Their azure Bosom on the World below; The World below its Gratulations shed, And the light Hours on easy Pinions fled. Be this an Omen of a long Delight, Be all your Days so cloudless and so bright; Without a Ruffle, ev'ry Moment flow, More gentle than the softest Breezes blow: And thou, the gentlest Deity, O Love! Still either Breast with tender Passion move; Still Silvius, with his matchless Delia, charm; And ever Delia, with her Silvius, warm. It shall be so, if right the Muse foresee, And thus propitious Fates for you decree, “Still in the Front of Merit, full confest, “Shall Silvius stand, applauded, hail'd and blest; “Still Delia bloom in all the Sexes Charms, “Wit, Truth, good Humour, Beauty's beaming Arms; “Round both, shall Bliss intense, forever glow, “With all that Earth can give and Heav'n bestow. And be you Parents of a num'rous Race, Enrich'd with ev'ry Good and ev'ry Grace; Whose Wit, and Charms, and Innocence, and Truth, May be true Copies of their Parents Youth; And may your Happiness augment from theirs, Joy of your Age, and Comfort of your Years: 'Till peaceful Slumbers close at last your Eyes, And call you from the Earth, to mount the Skies. Colin in Despair. I Wild with his Grief, young Colin fled His Flocks and Plains, and sought a Grove, Where cover'd with a gloomy shade, He thus bemoan'd his hapless Love: While Rocks stood round and catch'd his cries, And Winds flew by, and sigh'd his Sighs. II A Tyrant rules within thy Mind, Thy Heart's as hard as flinty Stone, More cruel than mad Storms of Wind, And Rage it self is sooner won: The swelling Billows on the Sea, Are gentle Things, compar'd with thee. III In the bleak Regions of the Pole, Dread Hills of Snow perpetual rise, And Frost forbids the Streams to roll, And Seas congeal in Alps of Ice: Not all that frigid Zone can prove, A scene so cold as Silvia's Love. IV The Bees pursue the yellow Thyme, And warbling Birds rejoyce in May; Round Oaks, the clasping Ivies twine, And youthful Lambs enjoy their play; Each Creature has its Sport and Joy, And nothing's always curs'd but I. V Clouds will not always hide the Skie, Nor Show'rs forever swell the Streams; For Vapours vanish as they fly, Serene succeeds, and genial Gleams, All human Ills a respite find, And nought but Silvia's still unkind. VI Time stops not in its Course to flow, But runs a-round as roll the Spheres; Brings Winters and our Summers too, And Days and Nights compleat the Years: But Time can ne'er by all his Art, Dissolve my Silvia's marble Heart. VII Nor Wit, nor Verse, avail me more, They but augment and swell my Fire; I robb'd the Muse and spent her Store, I struck the Strings, and smote the Lyre: But ah! in Vain I found all these, As Pray'rs to Winds, or Sighs to Seas. VIII Then farewel Wit and Verse, no more Shall you delude my fond Desire; And farewel Muse with all thy store, Be broke the Strings, be dumb the Lyre: To ev'ry Art of Love adieu, And to the Charms of Silvia too. To BELINDA, On her Singing. Soon as Belinda moves th' obsequious Air, The laughing Loves around her all repair, And while she sings, successful try their Art, For ev'ry Accent wings a fatal Dart: Hence, all dissolv'd, we sicken in the Sound, And bleed with Joy, nor know how great's the Wound; The charming Poison thrills in ev'ry Vein, Nor feel we more the Pleasure or the Pain; Thus dying Martyrs burn in barb'rous Fires, And smile with great Delight, while Life expires. O where shall vanquish'd Man for Refuge fly, Slain by your Song, and conquer'd by your Eye? No more Amphion's Lyre shall now be fam'd, Nor Orpheus (celebrated long) be nam'd: Old worn-out Tales, which Fiction first begun, And long like Truth the smooth Romance has run; But now no longer shall th' Enchantment hold, Hence Truth shall reign, nor Fables more be told: For hearing you, Belinda, we confess You merit more, since you perform no less; One with his Song th' infernal Regions warm'd, And Hell of all it's Furies stood disarm'd; While he in moving Numbers sought his Wife, And beg'd the Powers to give her back to Life; Stern Proserpine, relenting, heard his Pray'r, And from the stygian Shades return'd the Fair. Strange Charms of Sound, that Fate's strong Laws subdue, In Orpheus fabled, in Belinda true. Obedient to her Voice, the Furies cease Their mad uproar, and Rage is hush'd to Peace: Wild, savage Hearts, to Tameness sink, surpris'd; And rugged Breasts grow soft and humaniz'd. Her Glance can strike the stubborn Gazer slain, Her Voice can call him back to Life again. The fiction'd Lyre could draw the Stones along, And Temples rose, and Walls were built by Song; With Speed, unloosen'd Rocks came rolling down, And as he play'd, jump'd hasty to a Town; But you, Belinda, Life with Motion give, Teach Stones to sigh, and make the Rocks to live; As from your Tongue, the pow'rful Musick parts, Earth turns to Soul, and Flints dissolve to Hearts: Let Thebes it's Wonders from Amphion take, He made a Town, but you a People make. The 22d ODE of the First Book of Horace Translated. The Man whose Reason is unstain'd, Whose Heart is upright and unblam'd; May travel over burning Sands, Or uninhabitable Lands. If over Caucasus he goes, Or where the fam'd Hydaspes flows, He need not guard his Innocence, With Bows and Darts, the Moor's Defence; Nor loaden Quiver by his Side, With poison'd Arrows be supply'd. For as my Lalagen I sung, I heedless chanc'd to wander on, Beyond my Bounds, and while I stray'd The Sabine Woods, of nought afraid, A Wolf my careless Steps alarm'd, But fled me, tho' I was unarm'd. Whatever horrid Monster roves, Within Apulia's Oaken Groves, Or o'er Numidia's parched Plains, Where brinded Lyons shake their Manes; The Just may travel dauntless there, For Innocence has nought to fear. Lay me beneath the polar Skies, In frosty Fields, and Scenes of Ice, Where bleaky Arbors stand in Snow, Nor feel the Summer Zephyr blow. Or lay me, where the burning Sun Flames fiercely thro' the torrid Zone, Whose scorching Beams deny a Place For Habitant, beneath his Rays. Still pleas'd, I'll smile, and talk, and sing, And love my charming Lalagen. FRIENDSHIP. The Friendship which no Time can e'er deface It's Source is Virtue; Honour is it's Base. No Fortune governs, and no Int'rest binds, The social Bands of Love in noble Minds. Low grov'ling Souls may wear the brutal Ties, Of craving Sense, and avaricious Vice; These soon are broke, with ev'ry turn of Fate Then all the fierce Affection ends in Hate. But nobler Views the lasting Laws maintain, In gen'rous Breasts, where Truth and Honour reign; There, purest Flames in native Lustre glow, Purg'd from the grosser Elements below. No close Reserves the social Heart controul, But Freedom kindly opens out the Soul; Nor sordid Int'rest checks the warm Desire Nor taints the Thought, nor clouds the lambent Fire; But in his Friend each gen'rous Man is blest, And finds himself within Another's Breast; For private Ends, true Friendship still denies, When Self turns home, that Moment Friendship dies. In ancient Times, when Life and Love were long, (If we may Credit give to ancient Song,) Then Words were faithful Copies of the Mind, The Heart unveil'd, and Looks were undesign'd: Each Friend, his Thoughts without Restraint exprest, Nor kept one hid Reserve within his Breast: Thus Friendship did it's utmost Vertex climb, 'Twas then (if e'er it was) a golden Time. Alas! how far have these degenerate Days Struck from that Path and trod in diff'rent Ways? We look on other Times with other Eyes, And each has learn'd his Heart a darling Vice. No more our Bosoms feed the glorious Flame, For all of Friendship's lost, except the Name, And Friendship now, and Int'rest are the same. Yet some remain, (alas the Number's few!) Whose steady Feet, that ancient Path pursue; Smit with the noble Love of Virtue, those Dare yet be Friends, tho' half the World are Foes. Such Souls are they which strict Alliance claim, Meet Heart with Heart, and mingle Flame with Flame. Together, these a boundless Flight can take, Yet such a Flight as Truth itself may make. For no romantick Strain here swells the Mind, But all is real, artless, undesign'd: The Tongue unskil'd in Compliments to flow, Where Substance is possess'd, no need of show. Thrice happy Breasts are those, which thus maintain True Friendship's Laws, and wear the lib'ral Chain! The sordid Soul may grovel on below, And feel no Joys, but those the Senses know: The Great, in Pomp, may vainly swell with Pride, True Friends are happier than the World beside: When each his Breast with mutual Freedom tells, Nor Fault nor Virtue from his Friend conceals; Each Joy, or anxious Care, in ev'ry State, Delights them both, or both divide the Weight, For both together stand oppos'd to Fate. Ev'n LOVE itself upon this Union stands, Or other Terms, are vainly joyn'd the Hands: A Moment's Bliss, the Fop may once procure, But Sense and Virtue, only must endure: In Friendship, who have best themselves approv'd, May plead the largest Merit to be lov'd; 'Tis true, that gawdy Tinsel wins the Vain, But the slight Pleasure soon concludes in Pain; And yet too late the fatal Cheat appears, We laugh one Day perhaps, then mourn for Years. Two gen'rous Souls, alone each other draw, 'Tis Friendship makes for LOVE, a lasting Law. Happy the faithful Pair, who thus combine, The sweets of LOVE to Friendship's strength to join, How melt their Souls, how soft their Moments fly! How long their Prospects of continued Joy! Let all the Beaus, the Witlings of the Town, The savage 'Squire, the Booby and the Clown, In one gross Heap, with Scorn, aside be thrown, For Worth is happy in it's Bride, alone. A Night-Contemplation, In Imitation of Milton's Stile. ? Deum namque ire per omnes Terrasque, trastusque maris, cœlumque profundum. Virgil. Upon the gentle rising of a Hill, Beset with lofty Trees, whose darksome Boughs Wav'd slow, and to the Fan of rustling Airs Gave tender Voice, such as might lull to rest The wearied Mind, or lift the studious Soul To Thoughts sublime, and Contemplations high, A Sage, for Wisdom fam'd, his private walk Selected, while the Works of Nature call'd Thro' the still Eve, for Meditations deep. The Hint of this Discription is taken from the Spectator. No. 565. First on the setting Sun he darts his Eye, Whose Rays refracted thro' the dusky Wreaths Of humid Clouds, with richest Colours paint, And spread o'er all the West a various Dye. 'Till Night began to wrap the Face of Things In gentle Gloom, and with her shadowy Cone Mount on the eastern Quarter of the Skies. Then first the Stars, of Magnitude the Prime, And rolling Planets, lighted up their Fires; More numerous still, 'till all the Firmament Shone forth with Myriads, a stupendious Glow! While the bright Galaxy, with shining white Girt the wide Concave, as the Belt of Heaven. But now the Moon, in clouded Majesty Past o'er th' Horizon, and with Silver Ray Disclos'd again, the Face of this Terrene, And mixing with the pervious Shades of Night, Call'd Nature forth, in softest Lights to shine. This, when the ravish'd Sage attentive view'd, In the stretch'd Ken of deep Philosophy, Thus he began t'exclaim in sacred Phrase. O great Creator! when I meditate These Heav'ns, the Work of thy Almighty Hands, The Moon resplendent, and her Train of Stars, By thee enlighten'd, and by thee ordain'd; Ah what is Man, that thou should'st mindful be Of him? Can Mankind merit thy regard? Maker of this extended Universe! Compar'd with which, how small an Atom seems Ev'n our whole System, tho' a Sun and Worlds, In it, have spacious Liberty to roll! While thou by secret Laws their Motion guid'st, Thro' unresisting Æther, rarely purg'd; And by Projection and Attraction, bind'st To destin'd Orbits, each revolving Sphere; Harmonious and delectable, the Whole. The Whole, how vast! how spacious! yet how small, When to yon fixed Firmament of Light, I lift my soaring Thought, and ev'ry Star Swells to a Sun immense, around whose Orb, New Planets dance, and other Systems turn? Stupendious Range of rolling Worlds and Suns! More num'rous than are Sands or Atoms here. Thus, whilst Imagination swift, pervades Creation's Womb, and flies from Globe to Globe, Prodigious length, unutterable Space! Beyond what Time or Number can express; My drooping Fancy, flags her weary Wing, While still (perhaps) th' immeasurable way, She yet has pass'd, or all that Thought could pass In twice ten thousand Ages, would but seem A Point, compar'd with the whole Universe: And still the Universe it self, thus large, Is but a Point, O Deity! to thee. Without Circumference, or Bound art thou, Existing far beyond the Heaven of Heavens; Full and compleat, eternal, infinite. Ah, how shall Man, vain Particle of Being! Begirt thy Throne, Inhabitant immense! Within whose Sight, (as Pendent from thy Hand,) The Sum of Things, (beyond all human Thought, In long progressive Æras to pervade,) Hangs trembling, but a Spec of Entity. What Figure then must human Species form Amongst th' Assemblage of created Worlds, Low grov'ling on this dusky Spot of Earth? But nothing can below thee lie conceal'd; Minutest Essences escape not thee; And great and little thou behold'st alike. By thee the Frame indefinite, is mov'd; By thee, these Suns are all replete with Light, And emanate on all their circling Worlds; Thou guid'st these Worlds, the whole is full of Thee. Here, obvious on the Earth, thy Presence dwells: The vegitable Kingdoms, and the Realms Of Species that exist progressive, down Thro' Matter still divided without End; Beyond the nicest search of convex Glass, Or Fancy's self to follow, there art thou Existing intimately; while the Voice Of Nature, from her darkest Cells, acclaims Thy Power far echoing thro' the vast of Heaven. Let Man then joyn this universal Choir, To lift thy Glory, Men and Angels joyn! To praise and to proclaim thee All in All. Peace and Retirement. INSCRIB'D To Mr. Robert Walker, August, 1729. In these censorious Days, when Those delight To censure largely, who could never write, What Author dares to hope he shall succeed, When more are Criticks, than have learn'd to read? Yet be thou kind, my Friend! at whose Desire, I call upon the MUSE, and court her Fire: If thou approv'st, I care not who condemn, The Rage of Coxcombs is the Road to Fame. O bear me far from Scenes of anxious Strife, The Noise of Fools, and vexing Cares of Life! While Peace and calm Retirement grace my Song; To smoothest Themes, the smoothest Hours belong. May sleepless Nights be W??????'s, to restrain Th' ambitious Spirit of perfidious Spain; With Fleets to guard Gibraltar and Mahon; Or calm his jealous Enemies at Home: And let the murm'ring Nation, Fears commence From publick Conduct, and the Realm's Expence; A sweet Retirement from their Broils, be mine; Not subject, or to glory, or repine. Tho' ev'ry haughty Pow'r on Earth contend, And each to be the Friend of Man pretend; I leave the Friend of Mankind and the Foe, To Providence above, and George below. Come, heav'nly Peace! dear Sister of Content, Calm thou the World, and hostile Woes prevent; Reduce the Nations to thy blest Command, And rule the Kingdoms with thy Olive Wand. If thou withdraw'st thy Presence from Mankind, All Bliss adieu, we give it to the Wind. In ev'ry Bosom, thirst of Vi'lence burns, And Grief and Hatred rack the Mind by turns; No social Graces teach the Mein to shine, But gloomy lours the human Face divine; The Poles are vex'd with more than Ice or Snow, And fiercer Flames about th' Equator glow: The Sword destructive gleams, and Cannons roar, Where the white Harvest rustling way'd before; Th' astonish'd Husbandman beholds, agast, His Labour ruin'd, and his Vintage Waste; His Hands have idly thrown the fruitless Grain, The Grape grows full, the Citron blows, in vain. Sad seat of War! nor more of Joy appears, Where tender Orphans Cries, and Widow's Tears, Teach lonely Shades, and silent Walls to mourn, For Heroes who must never more return; Scenes of black Grief, and solitary Woe, Wring ev'ry Heart, and darken ev'ry Brow; Each Morning lowrs, and heavy mounts to Noon, And Ev'ning falls in melancholy Gloom: By Night, no Joy the Bed can give the Bride, But sobbing o'er the dear forsaken Side, The visionary Sword before her gleams, She shrieks in Sleep, and frighted, starts in Dreams. But when, celestial Virtue! thou descends, The Furies cease, and madding Discord Ends; Each Bosom feels a Spring of Pleasure flow, And Grief and Sadness seek the Shades below; Each Face renews the Charms of blooming Joy, And gay Delight sits sparkling in each Eye: No Fields of Bloody Glory fire the Mind, But softer Scenes appear, and Days more kind. The joyful Peasant takes his Pipe again, And thus renews his Numbers on the Plain. Now blow ye Breezes, gentle Show'rs come down; Dawn bright ye Morns, and kindly roll thou Sun; Unlock your crystal Streamlets, ev'ry Spring, Shine out-ye Groves, ye feather'd Warblers sing! For now no more the anxious Hind shall rue, What Flocks he bred, or gainless Closes sew; The Sower and the Reaper shall be one, And all the Fullness of the Year our own; PEACE comes, and smiling Plenty tends her Way, And the glad Shepherd hails the blissful Day. Thus sings the Swain, and with a raptur'd Eye, Surveys the Fields, or meditates the Skie: While all the Great, and Wise, and Learn'd, retire, And feel soft Solitudes, their Souls to fire. Now lib'ral Arts begin afresh to shine, And Science opens out her Charms divine: Some thro' the mystick Ways of Nature run, And search the Source from whence her Laws begun: The Mind's Recesses, are by others sought, How Thought begins, and Actions follow Thought, Others aloft expatiate o'er the Spheres, Discry new Suns, and find out Worlds in Stars. While Souls less studious, seek a gentler Bliss, And melt in humbler Scenes of Happiness: The forward Youth who swell'd at Glory's Charms, And dauntless, sought his Foe in horrid Arms, Or drench'd in Blood, reluctant left the Field, Sheath'd the broad Sword, and ceas'd to poize the Shield; Pursuits more humane, now become his Care, His Prize is Beauty, and his Chace the Fair. While the dear Nymph he leads from Grove to Grove, His Heart beats thick with Tenderness and Love; His Soul, which oft unmov'd has wag'd the Fight, Lies all subdu'd to Beauty's stronger Might; From Dream to Dream his ravish'd Fancy's tost, And all the Warriour in the Lover's lost. How e'er Mankind may fill the Trump of Fame, With Praise and Glory, all is but a Name; For Happiness, abroad we vainly roam, Our solid Blessings are procur'd at Home, In calm Retreats and silent Solitudes, Where Pomp not dazles, nor the Crowd intrudes. Happy the Man, who such a State enjoys, If such a happy State he right employs; The Mind there plac'd, Intent it self surveys, Looks back on Life, and scans our various Ways; Examins all the Passions to their Source, And teaches Reason to correct their Force. Here Virtue first displays her Virgin-Charms, Smites the rapt Soul, and all the Bosom warms: Hail! holiest, dearest, loveliest, best of Things, From thee, the Purity of Conscience springs; Thou o'er the Mind a grand Composure casts, Which neither Fools disturb, nor slander blasts; Nor rising Gusts of popular Applause, Nor the dire Venom thrown from Envy's Jaws, Exalts the Thought on Clouds of vain Deceit, Or damps the Soul, establish'd to be great: Fixt on strong Truth her lasting Pleasures grow While Jarrs and Jangle pass unheard below. O peaceful Virtue! all the Graces wait, Thy sweet Retirements and adorn thy State; The Land is more than blest, that thee contains, Its Hills are Eden, Paradise its Plains: Thou mixest Æthiopia's Heats with Joys, And warm'st the Scythian Snows, and Zembla's Ice; Thou smooth'st the Main and mak'st the Desart smile, And call'st forth Olives on the barren Soil. O give me, gracious Pow'rs! a Silvan Seat, A peaceful Mansion in some close Retreat; Where led by Love of Solitude, thro' Shades, And Fields, and spreading Groves, and opening Glades; There clear my Sight, and teach my Eyes to see, Thy Ways, O Truth! and Virtue find with thee. Sequester'd from the Grief and tort'ring Cares, Of human Life, and all its dire Affairs, Teach me to find the Thing so little known, Divine Content, and purchase it my own. And O if there be yet a Blessing more, It is to have a Friend or two in store, With a kind Partner from the softer Fair, To melt my Heart, and sooth my Soul from Care; To sweeten the stern Mein of deep Discourse, Or gently to unbend my studious Hours; With kind Endearments, tender Passions move, And all the blissful Joys of virtuous Love. Nor shall I then forget the tuneful Throng, Nor cease th' enchanting Ways of sacred Song; The Muse forever covets Silvan Shades, Green Banks, and purling Streams, and flow'ry Beds; She bids the Man, whose Bosom she designs Shall be productive of immortal Lines: The jangling Crowds of busy Towns to shun, And into Groves and rural Cots to run; There opening out her Charms, without controul, Raptures the Heart, and ravishes the Soul. Pope thus, while Windsor's Breezes fann'd his Flame, Shot up to Praise, and ripen'd into Fame: And thus magistick Denham's Breast was stung, On Cooper's Hill, with vi'lent Love of Song. When from the verdant Steep, the Thames he ey'd, In limpid Lapse, and Silver Waves to glide; “Tho' deep, yet clear, tho' gentle yet not dull, “Strong without Rage, without o'er-flowing full. Nor can the Muse her Cowley's Name forget, Ah, still with sighs she-recollects his Fate, With Love of Meads and Fields, too warmly fir'd, He shot beyond the Life so much desir'd; Perhaps some heav'nly Muse attends him now, On Plains, where never-fading Verdures grow. Oh Addison! thee next the Muse deplores, For all her Charms were thine, and all her Stores, Ere thy great Genius from the World withdrew, How Poesie flourish'd, how young Poets grew, Bays, round an hundred Heads began to speed, And ev'ry blithesome Shepherd tun'd his Reed; Sweet past'ral Lays on ev'ry Plain were known, And ev'ry Lay begun from Addison. But now no more the ravish'd Breast is fir'd, In Addison the Muses all expir'd, His Elegy, the last that Tickel sung, And Pope no more provokes the tuneful Throng, But careless seems of further Praise, while Gay Sooths the dull Town with Sing-sang Opera; Of wretched Taste, the woeful Evidence, Of dearth of Wit, and mighty loss of Sense. O might some Portion of that heav'nly Flame Descend, to rouze the slumbring World again, To set the Mind upon her ancient Heights, And bid the Muse to tour sublime her Flights, To fill the Soul with Sentiments refin'd, And banish tuneful Nonsense from Mankind. To Mr. G?m; On his Design of furnishing the Town of S?d with the Publick News Papers. Had I the Fire of ancient Sibils, And ev'ry Muse 'twixt Pope's and Tibbald's, Then launch'd into prophetic Phrase, In gliding Verse and flowing Lays, I should be qualified to Show, What wond'rous change this Town shall know, By your Design, dear Colonel! What Ignorance it shall expel: How Wit shall kindle up it's Taper, In ev'ry Head from ev'ry Paper, And Politicks be canvas'd o'er, Where Politicks were ne'er before. And, Pow'rs immortal! can it be, That this great Theme should fall to me? To celebrate in tuneful Rhyme, Thy Acts, and wake thy Fame, O G?m! Thy Fame once up, it ne'er shall sink, While thou hast Wine, or I have Ink. Tho' Thanks abundance, thou wilt give, Sure thou more justly may'st receive; For as my Numbers I pursue, Methinks I kindle at the View; Rapt into future Times, I see The Gain of us (thy Guests) and thee; But great is ours, compar'd with thine, The little Profit of thy Wine, Our Gain is of a nobler kind, More rational, and more refin'd; We come to view, and learn to know, How the World goes, and how 'twill go; Nor did that mighty Chief, whose Glory, So brightly blazes in old Story, So many Realms and Manners see, In all his famous Tour, as we; We, who need rarely stir abroad, Beyond the Hills to view the Road, Assisted by thy News, can stretch Our Sight beyond the Glasses reach, And without trav'ling, can extend, Our Views to Earth's remotest End. O'er diff'rent Climes each Reader ranges, The Poles, the Indies, and the Ganges; And sees the Courts of all the Nations, Their Strength, their Genius, and their Fashions; The Riches, Policy, and Trafick, Of Europe, Asia, and of Afric. Great Sphere of Learning, boundless Knowledge, Beyond the Reach of School or College; By which we're taught to raise, at once, Our Thoughts from Coal-Pits, up to Thrones, And lift our Minds from Talk with Masters, Or vulgar Keelmen and their Caster's To high Disputes of Peace and Wars, 'Mongst Powers, and Kings, and Emperors; Th' Additions, Explanations, Flaws, Amends of Bills, and Acts, and Laws. See from what Pens, our News approaches, And diff'rent Hands give diff'rent Touches; With various Stile and Elegance, Each Author propagates his Sense; One shows his Wit in Admirations, Or quotes, and then makes Applications, Or shoots against prime Ministers, In small Italick Characters; Another, to it roundly falls, In certain Words, all Capitals; Thus Fowlers o'er their Prey prevail, And kill with Bullets, or with Hail. But of all Monsters that stare at us, That Chasm, which Scholars name Hiatus, Does most our lab'ring Wits confound; All Penetration, there is drown'd; So puzled Hobbs, did once enquire Into the Peak of Derbyshire, But could not for his Blood and Soul, Find out the Depth of Elden-Hole. But this I leave, as more have done, A Hint to be commented on. See, where upon the Table laid, Each Paper by itself is spread; There Ev'ning Posts or Votes appear, A Pamphlet or a Gazette here; The British Journal, Written Letter, Or old Stone-castle's new Spectator, Next strike the View, while some are lost, Which to read first, or praise the most; But others warm'd with Party-Zeal, For this, or that, a longing feel. And ev'ry Reader is divided, In Judgment, as his Notion's guided; Thus as ideally we stray, Each is a Critick in his way, Or wisely int'rogates, or answers, About the mystick Sense of D'Anvers; Some think he writes with force of Reason, And others judge his Paper, Treason: One cries his poignancy encreases, And W? is cut all to Pieces; Another laughs, and says 'tis faint, For W? is an Adamant. Next Judgment's pass'd on Mist's Successor, Of all his Wit a just Possessor; Whose mighty Intellects inherit, A double Portion of his Spirit: With mystic Sneer and Hesitation, Against the Rulers of the Nation, He vents his comick Spleen, no Treason, To any Reader void of Reason. O could I speak his Excellences, His solid Head, and weighty Senses, How much they aid him in his sinking, Into a vast profound of Thinking! Like that unfathom'd Inclination, Philosophers call Gravitation, Which brings down Mists and Fogs below, And makes their Distillations flow, Which downwards draws all Parts of Matter, And adds all Force and Weight to Nature. And as that Property, in vain, The Learn'd are puzled to explain, So what's his Drift, or what's his meaning, Is much too deep for my obtaining; And since my Thoughts cannot surround him I leave him in the Place I found him. And next, if all my skill could draw, (My skill should all be shown, to show) The great Advantage, which in spight Of all that all ill Writers write, Shall soon accrue to us, but Striplings, In Politicks, in Wit, but Witlings; As we the diff'rent Sense peruse, Of ev'ry Writer that writes News; How we shall ripen and refine, And see the World about us shine; Each Part display'd, as each Part varies, As plain as Words in Dictionaries. Blest with the Prospect of such Science, We hold all others at defiance; We envy not the Mathematick Art unpolite, pedantick Topick! Nor wish our selves Astronomers, To ramble up and down the Stars; Nor with Philosophy to cheat The human Mind with vain Deceit. What is't to us if Men or Satyrs, People the Moon, or other Creatures? Or if the Sun be fluid Gold, Or Hell enrag'd, as others hold? It is enough for us to know What solid Gold he breeds below; And how about that Mettal, Princes Scare one another from their Senses, While each is try'd, or strong, or feeble, And Hell's stirr'd up amongst the People. Sure Men are mad as Alexander, To Stars for other Worlds to wander, When they're in one, none can deny it, A greater than they can keep quiet. O Pride of Mortals, who shall tame thee, When all the Earth cannot contain thee? Wild Beasts, thro' Forests only stray, Or make the Wilderness their way; For still will Hills or Vales surround them, Or Lakes, or Seas, or Oceans, bound them: Ev'n Birds, the Denizens of Air, Are stinted by the Atmosphere; But Man, that most prodigious Creature, Ungovernable in his Nature, Breaks o'er all Fences unconfin'd, And Scales the Heav'ns with lofty Mind, Each Place in Space infinite changes, And without ne plus ultra ranges. Yet, tho' our Tempers be so various, Thy Papers, G?m! so multifarious, Shall entertain that roving Spirit, And keep it on the Earth, or near it; Such diff'rent Themes, and diff'rent Tidings, From ev'ry Spot of Man's Residings, Shall fix our Thoughts and charm our Eyes, While we all grow polite and wise, More Sage than deep Metaphisicians, All Councellors, all Politicians. How can it miss, when ev'ry Land, Shall give its Knowledge to our Hand? Each Town, each Court in ev'ry Quarter, From Peru to the savage Tartar, With all their Secrets shall accost us, And pay their Tribute to thy Post-House. Ev'n great Designs and mighty Things, Shall from the Closets break, of Kings, And Schemes laid deep in dark Disguise, Shall be unravel'd to our Eyes; Nay scarce a Minister may breathe, Or Infant Prince shall get his Teeth, But o'er the Seas, the Winds shall blow it, And we immediately shall know it. If Storms and Tempests beat the Coast And swell the Main, and Ships be lost: Or Prodigies awaken Wonder, Or Ætna from her Entrails Thunder; What People live to good old Age, Or who untimely leaves the Stage; With other deep Intelligences, Of Duels fought and ravish'd Wenches, Of Windows broke and Watchmen kickt, Of Mobs enrag'd, and Pockets pickt; What ever Time or Fate unfold, All, quickly to us will be told. What foreign Soils produce in Spice, To us, shall travel in a Trice; What Trees weep Balm, what Amber flows, What Coral reddens, Ruby glows; What Stones, what Pearls of Price are found, And what Tobacco flocks the Ground Of Indian Planters, and what Canes, Are like to crown the Lab'rer's Pains; What Oranges in China grow, Or near Seville incline the Bough; Thee Seville! growing Child of Fame, Whom some admire and others blame; These blast thy Praise, O Town! what Pity, All love thy Fruit, but not thy Treaty, Fruit! that which Poets sung of old, Hesperian, vegitable Gold! Smit with the Flavour of thy Juice, But we, than they, know more thy Use, In Punch, for making Noddles merry Beyond the Blood of Grape or Berry. But I degress, and fear my Song, Has for a Letter been too long, So begging Pardon for what's o'er, I promise to offend no more. Here ends the Tenour of my Verse, There is much better and much worse. On Sr. Richard Steele's Christian HERO. 'Twas nobly dar'd in these degen'rate Days By such a Work as this to merit Praise: To free the Soul from prejudic'd Mistake, And teach the Mind it's Errours to forsake. To set up Christian Strength before our Eyes, And learn us, Roman Greatness to despise. Methinks I now the modern Deist see, Arm'd with his Reason and Philosophy, Unfold thy Page, and with malignant Leer, Survey the Name, and read it with a Sneer. And bent on Mirth, or to divert his Spleen, Resolves to view the stupid Stuff within; But charm'd with Eloquence, and manly Prose, Soon graver turns and more attentive grows. He shortly finds his hasty Censure vain, And feels less Joy in Sentiments profane. Surpriz'd, he sees new Arguments prevail, And Reason prove itself, as Nature, frail. His dictates of Morality less lov'd He finds, and bright Religion stands approv'd; When he beholds firm Cato's Constancy, His Strength, his Precepts, and Philosophy, The steady Hate of Cassius, Brutus' Zeal, And ev'ry boasted Roman Virtue fail, When destitute of all his self supplies, The Heathen Hero basely sinks and dies. Abash'd, he feels a Sting of gen'rous Pain, That bids him own his Principles are vain, Than Artifice, his Fortitude no more. That flies the Crisis of a trying Hour; But vacant of himself, he now pursues A glorious Path, and more extended Views: New Scenes of awful Goodness strike his Eyes, For here he sees the Christian Hero rise; What e'er the Roman in his Theory taught, Is here improv'd and into Practice brought. Here Grace perfects, what Reason first began, And GOD supplies the weak Defects of Man. The Hero bravely dares with just Disdain The Perils of the Land, and of the Main. And what the baffled Heathen sought to flie The Gallant Christian meets with Smiles of Joy: No Bolts, or Chains, are grievous to his Limbs, But where the Roman groan'd, the Christian Hymns. With strength of Faith he beats his Sorrows down, And firmly Eyes his bright immortal Crown. AN ESSAY Upon the ART of POETRY. Written An' Dom' 1728. Munus &amp; officium, nil scribens ipse, docebo; Unde parantur opes, quid alat formetq; poetam: Quid deceat, quid non, quò virtus, quò ferat error. Hor. ? Mediocribus esse poetis Non homines, non dii, non concessere columnæ. Si paulùm à summo discessit, vergit ad imum. Hor. Of all ill Writers, by the Critics curst, Bad Poets are undoubtedly the worst; Who, in the Spite of Genius, strive to chime In Strains as poor and lean as Pharaoh's Kine. But those, whose Fortune, better Stars proclaim, Who feel the Touches of celestial Flame, ? Fuit hæc sapientia quondam, Publica privatis secernere, sacra prosanis; Concubitu prohibere vago, dare jura maritis; Oppida moliri, leges incedere ligno. Sic honor &amp; nomen divinis vatibus atque Carmmibus venit. ? Hor.By whom the Soul is lifted and refin'd, They merit loud applause from all Mankind. But while with vain Desire vast Numbers stray, Few find the happy Genius of the Way; Such as of old was known the sacred Road, Where Homer travel'd, and where Virgil trod: And such as since, in later Times was known, To lead a Milton and an Addison. Whose strains Divine, far future Sons shall fire, And thousand Ages yet to come, admire. You, who would learn to imitate their Lays, Hear kindly, what my friendly Muse essays, Tho' she on slender Wings, attempts to rise, And diffident, revolves her enterprize. Hard is the Task when Counsel is design'd: Such is the Pride of the most empty Mind, It hates Advice, Adhuc neminem cognovi poetam, qui sibi non optimus videretur. Cic. Tusc. 5. and would be thought to know As well as you, perhaps and better too: Thus ev'ry Fool esteems your Precepts stuff, And each poor vacant Head is wise enough; Si defendere delictum, quàm vertere, malles; Nullum ultra verbum, aut operam insumebat inanem, Quin sine rivali teque &amp; tua solus amares. Hor.And let it so remain, the gen'rous Heart Shall kindly take what Friendship can impart. Mille hominum Species &amp; rerum discolor usus. Velle suum cuique est, nec voto vivitur uno. Pers. Sat. 5.Our Thoughts on Things in various Manners fall, And nothing tastes exact alike to all: The Man of Sense is pleas'd with nat'ral Thoughts, And Fools are always proud of finding Faults. Quot homines, tot sententiæ: suns cuiq; mos. Ter. Phor.Mankind attains Delight by diff'rent Ways; One likes to sneer, another likes to praise; A third in raving Madness loves to grieve; Thus all Men's nat'ral Tempers feed and live. Not damp'd at this, the Muse begins her flight, And braves the Risque of ev'ry Critic's spite. To trace those Paths, which have been travel'd o'er By Horace, Buckingham, and Pope, before; Blest Poets, whom the sacred Nine inspir'd, Their Genius lifted, and their Raptures fir'd. Rash my Design! nor am I yet so vain, To match with these, or think to rival them: But while Mankind allows they all excel In Nature's chief Master-Piece, is Writing well. D. BUCK. Ess. Po. Nature's Master-piece of Writing well; The Muse permits, and prompts me to pursue In humbler flights, and warms me at the view; And tho' th' attempt be bold, the Labour hard, The glorious Toil shall be its own reward; To sing, and imitate superior Lays, Shall purchase Pleasure, if it win no Praise. Then know, tho' Verse, in vain that Mortal tries, Whose Genius leads not, and whose Star denies; ? Ego nec studium sine divite venâ, Nec rude quid prosti video ingenium. Hor.Yet still a Mind, from Heav'n with Genius fir'd, Stands need of human Means, and Arts acquir'd, No Art without it, ever could excel, Nor Genius void of Art can thrive so well: ? Alterius sic Altera poscit opem res, &amp; conjurat amicé. Hor.Let both conspire, but let the foremost reign, And long as Homer's, shall your Verse remain; The latest Times, you happy Strains shall please, And ev'ry Age your gath'ring Fame encrease. Consider Nature well, before you start, And take your skill from her to judge of Art; She is the Source, whence all true Beauties flow, And what is merit, she first made it so: Hence, you will learn with Justice to despise Those mean Conceits which vulgar Readers prize. If Nature has design'd you for the Muse, She will not fail to charm you with her views; Still as you follow, she'll invite you more, And make that Pleasure, which was toil before; Be this the Test whereon to prove your force, Your love of Nature, is your Vein for Verse. Aurea prima sata est ætas. Sine militis usu Mollia securæ peragebant otia gentes. Ovid. Hanc olim veteres vitam coluere sabini, Hanc Remus &amp; frater. ? Virg. In the first Ages, while Mankind were blest With easy Labour and successive Rest; Ere haughty Monarchs learn'd to swell in State, Or wretch'd amidst dissembling Flatt'rers sat; When happy Courts were held on smiling Plains, And Kings were Shepherds, and their Princes Swains. When trains of Nobles haunted Groves and Springs, And Hearts were plain, and Crowns were easy Things. Then Nature charm'd in all her various Dress, And Time fled on in golden Years of Peace: “The original of Poetry is ascribed to that Age which succeeded the Creation of the World; and as the Keeping of Flocks seems to have been the first Employment of Mankind, the most ancient sort of Poetry was probably Pastoral. 'Tis natural to imagin, that the leisure of those ancient Shepherds requiring some Diversion, none was so proper to that solitary Life as Singing; and that in their Songs they took Occasion to celebrate their own Felicity, from hence a Poem was invented. Pope's Disc. on Past. Poetry.Then first the Muse essay'd her tender Voice, And Rocks reply'd, and Hills return'd the Noise: On Pipes of Reeds, the Royal Shepherds play'd, Or sung sweet Numbers in the flow'ry Shade: Of Nature's Laws, and Nature's Charms they sung, And ev'ry Grove with its own Praises rung. Each Swain made his own Happiness his Theme, Inspir'd by ev'ry Wood and ev'ry Stream. In ev'ry Shade he found his Bosom warm, For Shades could rapture, Woods and Streams could charm; Then did the Muse all beautiful appear, Won ev'ry Heart, and ravish'd ev'ry Ear; No Points of Wit she sought, but nat'ral ease, And unaffected, lively Images. 'Twas strength of Genius on the Passions stole, Smit the rapt Mind, and glow'd upon the Soul. Ev'n yet, in spite of this degen'rate Age, True Genius still maintains its sacred rage: Down from far distant Times, to present Days, The Muse has born her never-dying Lays; Her Fire still pure, eternal lives her Flame, And what she was, forever is the same. Her Genius soars, despising to submit To little gothick Ornaments of Wit: Who feels the Touch of her inspiring Ray, Sees the mean Track, and scorns to tread the Way. And as of old, she yet delights on Plains, In rural Solitudes, and bow'ry Scenes: Scriptorum chorus omnis amat nemus, &amp; fugit urbes, Rite cliens Bacchi somno gaudentes &amp; umbrâ. Hor. Ep. 2. Lib. 2.There leads her Sons, and makes her Numbers heard, And shows how once the beauteous World appear'd, Back, thro' devouring Time their Thoughts are cast, And live in Years an hundred Ages past. Hence the best Poets first the Muse assail, In rural Shades, and easy Pastoral; But gath'ring Strength, by just Degrees arise, And with the Lark, exchange the Plains for Skies. Vide Virg. 1 Ecl.Immortal Maro thus begins with Swains, In Tityrus' and Melibæus' strains; First his young Muse appears a Silvan Maid, And sings two Shepherds in a beechen Shade; But leaving these, she rides thro' Storms and Floods, With Heroes fights, and thunders with the Gods. And thus, a Mr. Pope. Bard, in later Times inspir'd, (To Windsor's blissful Plains and Shades retir'd;) On Thames' delightful Banks, his Numbers try'd, Now Daphnis spoke, and Strephon then reply'd: But soon in higher Flights his Muse was known, And all the mighty Iliad made his own: For him, had Fate th' Odyssey kept so long, For him Ulysses rang'd, and Homer sung. Let this be then your unambitious Aim, First to make Woods, and Hills, and Springs, your Theme: From wild Conceits these Subjects are most free, And teach you best, the old Simplicity; There, learn to flow in Verse, from ev'ry Stream, And Plains, draw sweet variety from them, Vales will teach lowliness, and Mountains, height; Those to depress, and these to raise your Flight; What's soft and mild, kind Breezes will inform; And what is fierce and rough, the raging Storm. Hence true Distinction you'll attain to know, What hurries on too fast, or laggs too slow; What to deny the Muse, and what to grant, And how to curb her Rage by just restraint; She, of her self, will keep no Bounds entire, Your Art must be to regulate her Fire. Now to indulge her Flights, and now to tame, To soften gently, but not quench her Flame: On either Hand a fatal Errour lies, This gives too much, and that too much denies. Serpit humi tutus nimiùm timidusq; procellæ. Hor.Here Nature's dwarft, and in a Pigmy ends, ? professus grandia turget. Idem.And swelling there, a Giant's Bulk ascends. The Muses, like the Horses of the Sun, Demand a Phœbus, not a Phaeton; A steady Judgment guides the sacred Glow, Nor lets it blaze too high, nor burn too low: Shun all Extreams, ? Medio tutissimus ibis. Ovid. Met. B. 2. the middle Path-way chuse, 'Tis safe, and there Success attends the Muse. Not that in one dull Line you still must run, And in the same poor Strain still grovel on; Observe what Images you are to draw, For these must steer your Course and be your Law: Rem tibi socraticæ poterunt ostendere chartæ. Verbaque provisam rem non invita sequentur. Hor.Your Images must be precisely known, Before a true Description can be drawn: When once the Mind has just Ideas gain'd, They're then, and not 'till then, with ease explain'd. When these are humble, sink in lowly Rhyme, When these are high, ascend the great Sublime: But in the last, with Care avoid that Vice, Of swelling, unintelligible Noise. 'Tis not vain Pomp of Words, or blust'ring sound, Where great and true Sublimity is found: It is a Majesty of Genius charms, Shines without glaring, without burning warms: A secret Spirit breathing thro' the whole, That dawns in ev'ry Part, a vig'rous Soul. Some Authors fill'd with greater Heat than Sense, Mistake gross Fustian for true Eloquence; On ev'ry Subject, they begin to write, Aut dum vitat humum, nubes &amp; inania captet. Hor.They still are wrapt in Clouds and out of Sight: Grande aliquid quod pulmo animæ prælargus anhelet. Pers. Sat. 1.On ev'ry Trifle they their Pomp discharge, As if all Beauty were in being large; Or no Distinction could be made between A Pigmy's squeak, and bell'wing Polypheme. But tho' with this no Reader can dispense, To find your Words too mighty for your Sense: Omnia quæ mogna sunt atque admirabilia, tempus aliquod quo primum efficerentur, habuerint, Quintil. lib. 12. c. 11.Yet some Descriptions to be drawn aright, Require the loftiest Strains, and boldest Flight; The Muse may then her strongest Pinions try, Nor can she be too great, nor soar too high. Yet still 'tis fit, whatever Heights she climb, To mount with ease, or false is her sublime; She must not seem with mighty Ragings strain'd, Or that her Greatness is with Labour gain'd; But in her high Career, she sits supream, Match for her Height, and equal to her Theme. Vide Hom. 1L. lib. 8.Thus Homer's Muse, when angry Jove descends, And on Mount Ida's Top his Terrour bends; She rises in the Vengeance of his Ire, And cloaths her self with Thunder and with Fire; The Verse, in Flames and dreadful Lightnings shines, And ev'ry Grecian trembles in his Lines. Such Flights, our Dread and Admiration move, But ev'ry Subject is not angry Jove; Singula quæque locum tenant sortita decenter. Hor.A diff'rent Theme, will diff'rent Lights require, A milder Fury, and a gentler Fire. Observe how Phœbus rules the various Year, And turns the Seasons, as he turns his Sphere: How regular he keeps the heav'nly Way, The God of Poetry as well as Day. Make him your Rule, who over Verse presides, And guide your Muse as he his Chariot guides. When he designs to give the World the Spring, The Flow'rs to blossom, and the Birds to sing; Thro' the warm Equinox he sweetly gleams, And mellows the hard Glebe with gentle Beams: By soft Degrees he gives the Buds to blow, And Streams refine, more limpid as they flow; Dense blasts of Wind wax unperceiv'd more rare, And Zephyrs melt to milder Breathes of Air. But when the Summer Season he bestows, He mounts, and more magestically glows; No more, mild Rays, his fierce Effusion pours, Nor melts the rolling Cloud in vernal Show'rs: His fiery Beams surprize the thirsty Plain, And gentle Morning Dews descend in vain. But when the Winter's bleak approach draws near, He then retires, and leaves the hoary Year; His Beams oblique, with fainting languor shine, In distant Skies, far Southward of the Line. On Rocks of Ice his feeble light'ning plays, Nor melt they down, but gather in his Rays. Such is the various Course your Muse must steer, And always just, and natural appear. Soft be the Verse, when gentle Spring's the Theme, But hoary Winter asks a hoarser Strain; Impetuous Floods and headlong Rivers, call The hasty Verse to hurry down their fall; But the calm Stream that scarce appears to Flow, Glides on in Words, smooth, easy, still, and slow. Not thus describe the stretching Courser's Flight, That scours the Plain, and slips beyond the Sight. Nor only Things, in proper Words express, But ev'ry Passion has its nat'ral Dress. ? Consuetaque verba: Blanda tamen, presens ut videare loqui. Ov. de Ar. Aman. lib. 1.If smiling Love's the Subject, let the Muse, The softest Words, and melting Accents chuse; Mix a kind Languor in each easy Line, And teach her Fires with gentle glow to shine: In tender Thoughts let ev'ry Verse appear, Warm in the Strain as in the Heart they were. The fair Delight not in a Stile that's fierce, And melting Love retires from pompous Verse. Vide Claudian's Court of Venus.No boist'rous Storms invade the Cyprian Isle, But blissful Calms and balmy Seasons smile; Indulgent Gales in sighing Zephirs blow, Flow'rs never fade, and Blooms eternal glow. ? Tristitia mœstum Vultum verba decent. ? Hor. And next to this, dejected Grief appears, Mourns in deep Wailings, and dissolves in Tears; Soft as the Strains of Love, but glides more slow, In solemn Gloom, and sad consuming woe; The Numbers in low Lamentations moan, With Thoughts to move, and Words to melt a Stone. ? Iratum plena minarum. Idem.But when mad Rage its dire Resentments speaks, In sudden Fire, the Muse her Numbers breaks; In haste she looses out the flying Rein, Destruction rouls, and Ruin swells the Strain: A thousand Ways of Death are view'd by turns, And all the Fury maddens as it burns: In ev'ry Verse the Vengeance mounts up higher, 'Till all the Line's one blaze of raging Fire. Descriptas servare vices, operûmque colores, Cur ego, si nequeo, ignoroq; poeta salutor? Hor. Thus ev'ry Subject like it self is drest, As each Man's Cloaths suit his own Person best; Each Action, and each Passion, just appears; Things Attitudes, Mankind have Characters. In vitium ducit culpæ fuga, si caret arte. Idem.Some Men not knowing what to what belong, Run into Faults, they cannot see are wrong; Or ventring out on Themes above their Strength, Fall into gross Absurdities at length. Citò scribendo non fit ut bene scribatur: bene scribendo, fit ut citò. Quintil. lib. 10. c. 3.And others are in so much haste to write, They hardly know one Thing they ought, aright; But rambling on confus'd, now here, now there, They say they know not what, they know not where: These, that their Errours may be undescry'd, In Clouds of Words their fluent Nonsence hide; As weak Philosophers recourse to chance, Which both explains and covers Ignorance. Sumite materiam vestris, qui scribitis aquam Viribus; &amp; versata diu, quid ferre recusent Quid valeant humeri: cui lecta potenter erit res, Nec facundia deseret hunc, nec lucidus ordo. Hor.Be warn'd from hence, and often scan your Theme, Things are not still exactly what they seem: Multo labore, assiduo studio, varia exercitatione, pluribus experimentis, ahissi ma prudentia, præsentissimo consilio constat ars dicendi. Quintil. lib. 2. c. 13.Your Thought must be most studiously confin'd, Ere you begin the Structure that's design'd; When once set out, the Labour all must cease, And the Verse flow with a delightful ease: The Temple thus of old began to rise, Not, 'till each Stone was hewn to proper size. If some new Thought your ravish'd Fancy fire, And Truth and Judgment warrant your Desire; Pursue while fancy's warm, but then beware, You do not spin the tender Thread too far; Least both your Thought and Labour prove in Vain, And lose in Spirit what in Words they gain. Beyond just Bounds be never known to stretch, But rather say too little than too much; The Fault of this is less than that extream, The Reader pall'd, the Rest provokes his phlegm; 'Tis better he depart unsatisfy'd, Desiring more, than overcharg'd and cloy'd. Tho' to begin will Skill and Judgment crave, As much is ask'd in knowing where to leave; Quid factum sit, quo sit modo factum. Quintil. lib. 4. c. 2.'Tis not sufficient that the Thing be said, But in what range the Images are laid; How well they suit the compass where they lie, How those with these, and with the whole comply. Tho' these are needful Rules, yet still their use, Without Discretion is a mere abuse. Beware no Precept bind you up too close, Least while you gain the Rule, the Fire you lose. Too strict pursuit of any human Rule, Grows flat and dry, pedantical and dull. T' avoid this Fault, besure to bear in Mind, That Nature's free, and hates to be confin'd; Where e'er she Works beneath too great constraint; A Monster breeds, too bulky or too scant. Natura etiam sine doctrina multum valebit, doctrina nulla esse sine natura poterit. Quintil. lib. 2. c. 19.In vain you Labour on the heavy Verse, When she lags Backwards and moves up by Force. How odd it looks to see the Mistress led, And drag'd up ungenteely by the Maid! Denique natura materiæ, ars doctrinæ est. Hæc fingit, illa fingitur. Nihil ars sinâ materia: materiæ etiam sinâ arte pretium est. Ars summa, materia optima melior. Idem.Let Nature still the foremost Glory gain, And Art behind, adjust her Lady's train; Unseen, dispose each Ornament she wears, Art wins most Praises, when it least appears. Rules thus conducted will not fail to please, We like good Method, when 'tis kept with ease; For when the Poet writes without design, Long wilds of Verse, and rhapsodies of Rhyme: The Reader vext at his perplexing maze, Returns him Curses, while he pants for praise. Propose some End, and still that end pursue, Be That your Means and That your Conduct too: Dispose each Word and order ev'ry Line, ? Servitur ad imum Qualis ab incœpto processerit, &amp; sibi constet. Hor.So, that Each point and move to the Design: If thus you steer, your end you will attain, And find at last, your Labour not in vain. And tho' some Places, to a scanty Thought, May seem imperfect, or contain a Fault; Such seeming Slips, if they promote the End, Are Slips of Moment which you must not mend; They add more Beauty than they take away, As Clouds reflect new Glories on the Day; Some Foils are needful to advance a Grace, As artful Patches on a beauteous Face. If only there, the Critic's spite assails, He damns in vain, and impotently rails; Like modern Athiests wanting Strength of Mind, The mystick Ways of Providence to find, Would mend all Nature that they can't discern, And find out Faults in Laws they want to learn; But this is all they teach Mankind from thence, Their own Impiety and want of Sense. Ne'er shun that Malice which can do no wrong, Nor dread the Clamours of an envious Tongue: Sometimes when these design the greatest ill, They raving find th'effect reverse their Will. Perhaps some beauteous Lights might 'scape Mankind, If no sour Critic cast his Shade behind; As Iris could not make her Colours known, If no dark Vapour should oppose the Sun. Be ne'er affraid of what the Critics dare, Let them rail freely, nor expect they'll spare; O magna vis veritatis, quæ contra hominum ingenia, calliditatem, Sobertiam contraque fictas omnium insidias facile se per seipsum defendat! Cic. Or. M. Cœl.Truth will survive, when all their Rage is by, And all beside (tho' they were mute) shall die. 'Tis in your Pow'r to make them to your Sense, If not the kindest, yet it's useful Friends. 'Tis possible some Blemish miss'd your Eye, And too, so small, that Friendship passes by; But the malicious Sight observes the Stain, And lets you know your Oversight with Pain; That Wisdom is the best, that comes by Cost, Shall last you longest and shall serve you most. Would you desire to please an Ear that's fine, Be never constant to one Pause or Rhyme: New change of Rhyme with Pleasure entertains, And varied Pauses will adorn your Strains; Verse, Juglar-like, when once the Secret's known, The Charm expires and all the Show is done; 'Tis necessary you should steer with Skill, To keep your Reader your dependent still; And sometimes this, as often that, prefer; Prompt him to guess, but leave him room to err; For if you still the same dull Method keep, He lies you down, and Yawns, or falls asleep. Tria sunt item quæ præstare debet Orator, ut moveat delectet deceat. Quintil. l. 3. c. 5.Be this your Care, Attention first to gain, This got, your Art must be to entertain. First win the Passions by a smooth Address, Gain Reason next, then keep what you possess. This Art once understood, and practis'd well, You'll miss the Fate a thousand Authors feel. The human Mind's a slip'ry Thing to seize, 'Tis soon disgusted, and 'tis hard to please; This Moment, Reason seems to hold the Sway, The next, the Passions bear it all away; And oft, whilst naked Justice it denies, A Fraud well cover'd, takes it by Surprize. Wise Stratagems will often please no less, Than Truth itself, tho' in the neatest Dress; To be deceiv'd, no Man e'er murmur'd yet, When his own Int'rest prosper'd by the Cheat. Sometimes to rise aloft you must a-light, Be dull on Purpose, that you may be bright; Lights joyn'd with Shades, in painting thus deceive, And each to each a just Relievo give; Light by it self, or shade, without this Rule, Would seem all Flatness, one and one all dull. What e'er you mount to, or where e'er you fall, There's Symmetry to be observ'd in all; Propriety to suit with ev'ry Grace, And Ornaments proportion'd to each Place. Beware (of all Things) how your Muse obeys The Charms of Wit, the vice of Modern Lays: As Brutes advert by Moments, so it lives, And no true Excellence or Pleasure gives; 'Tis hard to rule, and easily goes wrong, The Praise is short, but O the Scandal's long! Correct it's turns, and oft restrain it's Pride, Let Caution use it, and let Judgment guide; To just Decorum, all it's Wildness bring, For Wit ill tim'd's an execrable Thing: 'Tis of it self but like a falling Star, That shines a Moment e're it disappear, Let such admire it's Points whose Genius lies In narrow Bounds, and wants the Strength to rise. But nobler Minds Pursue at nobler Flights, And warm at Beauties in sublimer Heights; Such as the great majestick Iliad wears, Still fresh and young, and undecay'd by Years; Where Boldness, Ease, and Strength, and Sweetness join, And bright, and never fading Glories Shine. Charm'd with those Beauties of exalted Size, Your Taste will nauseate, meaner Relishes; Dispise those base polluted Springs below, And drink where pure Castalian Streamlets flow: There learn to imitate immortal Strains, Rapt and shut up in bright celestial Scenes. You, who are born to feel the heav'nly Fire, Whose bosoms glow, as sacred Heats inspire; Begin the Flight, for what deters your Voice, When Liberty invites the Muse's Choice? Rise into Verse; and sing th' auspicious LORD, By whom the Blessing's given, and secur'd. See mighty George! by gracious Heav'n design'd The Minister of Blessings to Mankind; Born with a Soul proportion'd to his Pow'r, To awe the World, and bid it's Broils be o'er: To calm the Tumults of the troubled Seas, And teach contending Nations social Peace. And see the shining Partner of his Crown, Bestows augmented Glories on the Throne! And as the first of all her Sex in Place, The first in Virtue, and the first in Face. O might I see the Glories of their Reign! Sung by some Muse, and in an equal Strain! That might to late Posterity prolong Blest Britain's Joys in celebrated Song: That when far distant Kings in Pow'r shall shine, Descended long from GEORGE and CAROLINE, And Nations yet unborn shall lift their Head, To them their Fathers Glories may be read. But cease my Muse, the Theme not Suits with thee, Content thee, thus to sing fair Liberty. Hail sacred Liberty, divinest Pow'r! O never leave thy fav'rite Albion's Shore! Still guard this Isle, while ev'ry Art by thee Exults, from arbitrary Sway set free; But most the Muse, that owes to thee her Lays, Shall sing thy Glories, and shall hymn thy Praise; In foreign Lands opprest, her Genius groans, Cramp'd under Tyrants, and despotic Thrones; Cold Damps of Fear invade her as she warms, And she no more appears in ancient Charms; But blest in Britain's more indulgent Isle, She opens out, and all her Graces smile: Her native Vigour, native Charms assumes, And ev'ry heav'nly Feature dawns and blooms; She soars again, and Britain is become, A new Augustan Reign, a brighter ROME.
