      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTORY OUTLINE. “What do they in the north.” Richard III. Of old, when Author's meant to try their skill, The verse began,—“Come forth my grey-goose quill;” But now, that each revolving season, brings New forms, and fashions, for all earthly things; When sound, and light, and motion, are no more What sound, and light, and motion were of yore; When all things vary, shall I summon still The Goose's raw simplicity of quill? No, art shall trim, and model it; and then I cry, “Come forth my Bramah's patent pen.” Come forth thou little “chronicler of time,” Thou precious accoucheur of prose, and rhyme; Dear to the happy, but more dear to those, Who wile away the memory of their woes; Who far from all who love them, and the mirth Which circles ever round a social hearth; Sigh in their solitudes, where not a word,— Nor laugh,—nor footstep of a friend, is heard; And sadly seize thee thus; and scribble rhymes, To banish thoughts of brighter, happier times. 'Tis thus I court thy aid, and bid thee drink From yonder chrystal fountain, streams of ink; From the same fount I'd quaff, could it bestow Like Lethe's flood,—forgetfulness of woe; Few months are past, since in my desk you lay In undistrub'd repose from day to day, I needed not your aid, for then the hours Flew swiftly by, Time never rests on flowers, 'Tis now he lingers while my spirit mourns,— As if 'twere luxury to sit on thorns! I scribbled not by day,—for then I rov'd Along the sea-beat shore with one I lov'd; I scribbled not by night,—for visions came, And I was busy—dreaming of her name; Dear was our early walk, when o'er the hill The grey mists of the morning hover'd still; Dear was the hour of noon;—our chosen seat Beneath the trees that shelter'd us from heat; Where daily I took forth a book, and said That she should sit and listen, whilst I read; The page was open'd, and we paus'd to look Upon each other;—and forgot the book.— Dear was the hour of sunset, for we knew To-morrow's sun together we should view: Dear was our evening song, and dear to me The feast of muffins and the flow of tea. But this is past, and now I take thee forth, To sketch the lights and shadows of the north; For her alone I'll sketch each passing scene, Alas! with her, how fair they might have been. “Aid me, ye Nine!” is still the common cant, All ask the aid which muses seldom grant; In calling spirits forth the task is small, But will those spirits come when we do call? Ye cruel Nine! how can ye disregard The pensive plaint of many a would-be bard, Who woos ye all en masse, and scorns to choose A snug flirtation with a single muse? Those midnight votaries, who oft consume Their ink, their paper, and their youthful bloom; Who talk of what they call their tuneful Lyre, Asking (what much they lack) Poetic fire. Ah! who can tell how hard it is to climb The hill, where Poet's meet with thoughts sublime, How many souls (and bodies we may add) Have woo'd good fortune, and have wedded bad! Have warr'd with fate, unable to defeat her,— (So Beattie said in other words and metre.) Some youth reads Pope, and in a little time, Learns (like a tune) the jingle of the rhyme; Then rashly puts his Pope upon the shelf, Buys a blank copy-book, and writes himself; Counts each line with his fingers, and then hopes His cold heroics are as good as Pope's! The jingling rhyme successfully he apes; The genius of his model all escapes. Thus minor beauties, striving to excel, Follow the fashions of some reigning belle; But, when each garment is exactly plac'd To copy all the frolics of her taste; They catch the artificial part alone, The charm remains exclusively her own. Our rhymster, in his lofty cheap abode, Is parturitious, and brings forth—an ode, The ode by some admiring friends is seen, And then is sent to Blackwood's magazine: “Old North with joy on such an ode will look, “He cannot fail to put it in his book; “All men of sense its talent must admire —North puts it in—He puts it in the fire. Oh blind injustice! still he writes away;— Still no rash publisher will print the lay; In manuscript it sleeps, nor can possess The type and margin, honors of the press: Thus ever doom'd to view—oh worse than all! His own dear verses, in his own vile scrawl; He ponders in his garret pale with care, Wasting his sweetness in the desert air; And chews the cud of bitter fancy too; With often very little else to chew. Yet still, though dull contemporaries frown, He feels secure of posthumous renown, Thinks the collected remnants of his wit Will move the earth—when he is under it; Visions like these his present pangs must heal, Which e'en if realiz'd, he could not feel; Will fame, or praise, or honors, comfort him Whose ears are closed in death—whose eyes are dim! For men alive he scorns to wield his pen, He writes for babes unborn, for embryo men. Whilst many a wild and wayward reverie, Floats round the station where his brains should be, And thoughts conceal'd in flimsy flowery clothing, And many mental flights, that end in nothing. But hold, where was I?—I must hasten back To my own theme, I've wander'd from the track; Muses, to you I spoke, attend my call, And hear my invocation, one, and all: I own that good auld Reekie's charms demand The mighty touches of a master hand; And much I hope a master's powerful pen Will one day draw her picture: but 'till then Permit a Southron hand to sketch in haste, A few faint outlines; easily effaced. Besides, the Master Bards appear all busy; First let us think of Byron—stop, where is he? Far from his home the noble minstrel strays, Courting Melpomene; composing plays.— “Ye breezes waft his tragic treasures o'er, “The sinking drama may revive once more.” His plays revive the drama! think not so; You must not dream of acting them you know: They're not adapted for the stage in fact;— (Though faith we've plays enough we cannot act:) But 'tis his way, and I suspect indeed, He means to send us books we must not read! And Scott, the great enchanter of the north, Who sent his verse romances crowding forth; Till suddenly he paus'd; and some one chose To send romances forth, as good, in prose! Though known to all, still call'd the great unknown, We now suspect no magic, but his own; Methinks his hands must now be full enough, 'Tis said he still is playing blind man's buff. Scott! thy pure muse may counteract the rhymes Of Atheist bards who gild the worst of crimes; Who make their heroes brutal, yet their skill Can deck them out in fascinations still; Who give alluring blandishments to evil, And paint us the flirtations of the Devil! Oh! still exert thy rare unrivall'd powers, Still cull Imgination's fairest flowers; Were life now closing round thee, there is not A single line that thou couldst wish to blot! And where is Southey? in himself an host; Who treads all learning's paths, and shines in most; The eloquent biographer, who trac'd Poor Nelson's life with feeling, truth, and taste; The pure historian, moralist, and sage, And every inch a bard in Roderick's page; But his last work! that nightmare of burlesque! “Visions of judgment hence”—nor haunt my desk. And where is Moore? the minstrel who can move Each secret pulse of tenderness, and love; The son of melody, whose touching words Float wedded to the music o'er the chords; Oh! how can one so highly gifted stray In personality's disgusting way? In Tommy Brown's ungentlemanlike dress You show us e'en Tom Little can be less. Couldst thou feel flatter'd when the vulgar laugh'd At the foul point of thy envenom'd shaft? Abandon Fudge;—believe me, such a book Can never raise the bard of Lalla Rookh: Cull from thy fancy's rich exhaustless store; Be great—be all thou hast been—nay, be Moore. Campbell when first he gave his talents scope, In polished numbers taught us how to hope, But now his angel visits are so few, That he hath taught us disappointment too: Say is his new and monthly task so hard, That in the editor he sinks the bard? If 'tis for this we taste the bitter cup, In his own magazine we'll blow him up. And what is Wordsworth doing? He who owns (At times)—an inspiration, which atones For much absurdity, and when he chooses Can make a long “Excursion” with the Muses, But whose unlucky Betty's, Bobs, and Peters, Throw into shade his rarer, nobler, metres; Perhaps e'en now his muse exalts the fame Of Jemmy Scraggs, or some such classic name; Or Nancy Dawson may employ his pen, With sky-blue women, or with small grey men. And Crabbe, whose muse is not admir'd the less, For painting nature in her simplest dress; Whose thoughts assume not a fantastic form, Who ne'er attempts to take one's praise by storm, But reigns supreme in feeling's tenderest scenes, And wins his readers' hearts by gentlest means. Leave him to choose his subjects, sure of this, His taste will never let him choose amiss; We find in him instead of proud pretence, Uncommon talents, join'd to common sense. And where is Rogers too? if Memory's Bard Were unremember'd 'twould indeed be hard; And Milman, poetry professor too, Few understand what they profess like you. And—. But I'll name no more, should I proceed Through all who write, 'twere difficult indeed. For countless Votaries round Parnassus lurk, And some must find it very up-hill work; Sick of his briefs, the Lawyer seeks relief In scribbling cantos—any thing but brief; Each Parson rhymes in a decorous way, And every Layman pens a tender lay. And Woman too predestin'd to excel, Whose form possesses such a lovely spell; Man views her, and believes perfection hers, Or he should veil her error—if she errs: She mounts the winged steed in triumph too, And though the vulgar say her hose are blue; Whilst Baillie, Tighe, and Hemans still possess So firm a seat, she well may hope success: And even when ye fail—ye gentle bards, When on the backs of invitation cards Ye've written sonnets, and divide your looks 'Twixt last new fashions, and the last new books; When dulcet lyric measures take the place Of measur'd tabinets, and lawn, and lace; When ye have shunn'd the concert and the dance, And scorn'd your sex's soft bewitching glance, And caught the poet's frenzy-rolling eye— (Extremely unbecoming by the bye;) If then Parnassus seems a hopeless prize, And, as you struggle, Alps on Alps arise; If still the Muses prove how rare their aid is, Remember you've been wooing nine young ladies! Think not if women often write in vain, Whilst men the Muses' richest smiles obtain; Think not their coldness should your spirit vex, 'Tis not your genius fails you, but your sex; The Nine are female, and each Muse bestows Her smiles (like other females) on the beaux. If there's a Muse will not disdain a lay, In which—sans method—grave is mix'd with gay; If haply there is one, whose eye prefers A wild al fresco outline;—I am hers. When sombre shades predominate too much, I'll change the prospect with a lighter touch; And when too much of trifling fills the strain, My own sad thoughts will change the scene again. My volume thus half earnest and half jest, Is like a snuff-box of two tunes possest, One lively and one sad: the same machine Pours forth each strain in turn from keys unseen. When either grows fatiguing; we know how To change the theme at once—As I do now. OUTLINE THE SECOND. “A certain convocation of politick worms.” Hamlet. Here Politics run vastly high, (indeed where do they not,) And Politics are dangerous, they make the temper hot; They play the deuce with men, and call their prejudices forth; And make them see with jaundic'd eyes, and undervalue worth. There's a certain old Review, adorn'd with yellow, and with blue, The people seem'd to make it quite their oracle, when new; But it prophecied on politics, assuming second sight, When It said things would all go wrong, alas! things all went right. And its literary prophecies were unsuccessful too; The Bards it hated, triumph'd o'er the yellow and the blue! The mighty We first fix'd upon a work,—no matter what; We car'd not if the subject was political or not; Mrs. Rundall upon Cookery, or Allison on Taste, Or Byron upon Pegasus, upon the page was plac'd; And then began an article about the coming storm, And injuries, and Bonaparte, and radical reform; In fact, the book review'd, was like a wooden peg alone, On which the sage reviewer hitch'd an essay of his own. It really is astonishing to hear the Whigs profuse In complaints respecting injuries, and personal abuse! The Whigs who for so long a time were very hard indeed, Upon all the Tory gentlefolks who differ'd from their creed; But when against themselves we turn their weapons, they exclaim, “What! read John Bull! or Blackwood's Magazine! oh fye, for shame.” The night it was tempestuous, and very hard it blew, And those who stirr'd within the street, were probably wet through; When Mr. Donald Whiglington was sitting at his ease, With his feet upon the fender, and his elbows on his knees; His wife was sitting near to him, and whilst her husband doz'd, Her red morocco reticule she silently unclos'd; And taking thence a newspaper, its pages wide she spread; She mov'd the sofa, snuff'd the candles, blew her nose, and read. Awhile she read it prudently, and quietly she sat, And smil'd upon this paragraph, and simper'd upon that; But soon she read another page, and ere she could proceed, She laugh'd aloud, and leaning back—cry'd, “very good, indeed.” The exclamation rous'd her spouse, who started at the sound, And half awake, and half asleep, look'd vacantly around; And said, “my love, what have you there? my dear, what can it be “Which makes you laugh this dreary night? my darling, give it me.” He took it—saw it—dropt it—and he cry'd, with anger full, “Oh wicked Mrs. Whiglington, how came you by John Bull?” “John Bull is so notorious, to name it is a sin, “(And from my soul I execrate all those who take it in;) “To see it on my tea-table now covers me with shame, “(Confound you Mrs. Whiglington you're very much to blame.) “Its pages are so scandalous! and scandal I abhor; “I cannot think what all our filthy neighbours read it for: “There's Mr. Whinn, who takes it in 's a nasty dirty beast, “And Mr. Shore, who lives next door, is mad, to say the least; “Its female readers all are vile, their characters are loose, “(I hate its pages—for I hate all scandalous abuse.) “Its violence is hateful, its expressions are too strong, “It violently states that we are radically wrong; “My dear it is too violent; (and violence I dread,)”— And saying so, he threw the silver teapot at her head. “Its coarseness is detestable! I think of it with shame! “Oh! hang you, Mrs. Whiglington, you're very much to blame.” To bed he went in anger, and to bed she went and cried; And when just warm, a mighty form stept up to his bedside; In vain he slunk beneath the clothes, and turn'd away his head, The form was ever visible, and hover'd o'er the bed. It call'd upon poor Whiglington, and gave his nose a pull, And said “Be bold, for now behold, the spirit of John Bull; “But though a spirit, think not that my energy is lost, “I always have been spirited, I am not yet a ghost. “How dare you say my pages are calumnious, and coarse? “Because my pen his potent, and the Whigs have felt its force: “How dare you say Johannes Bull vents slander in his rhymes, “You daily read the slanders of the Chronicle and Times: “You take them in, you know you do, though probably indeed, “You're one among the many who ne'er pay for what they read, “Who first take in the newspaper, and more discreetly still, “They next take in the editor, and never pay his bill! “Shall I be call'd calumnious—when Perry's page ran o'er, “With the Post Bag, and Fudge Family of Mr. Thomas M—re, “Whose humour is not good humour, yet for it we must lose, “All the beauty, and the brightness, and the feeling of his muse? “Whose taste, it seems can make him throw aside his laurel crown, “To wear the Tom Fool's jacket, of Tom Little, or Tom Brown, “And when the Morning Chronicle became a tasteless cup, “His fermentations were thrown in to make the Perry up. “How boldly and how long they hurl'd their arrows at the King, “It galls them now to see their dastard weapons left no sting; “How oft at female virtue was their slander thrown in vain! “And now they strive to fix on me the ignominious stain! “I hurl aside the calumny, and boldly I assert, “By me the name of innocence has never yet been hurt: “When guilt assum'd a gilded form, and dar'd to face the day, “When folly follow'd in her train, I tore the veil away; “One party made a rough attack, and ev'ry Bully knows, “A Lamb cannot resist a wolf; blows must be met by blows. “Now Whiglington, I leave thee to the terrors in thy breast, “My Printer's devils shall remain to scare away thy rest; “Know this, if any Radicals have been upon the rack, “If any Whigs have trembled,—I commenc'd not the attack. “Immortal and untainted are the pages which I print, “And ages hence my leaves will bear the true autumnal tint; “My motives will bear scrutiny when party passions cool, “For God, the King, and People—is the motto of John Bull.” And now the vision vanish'd—while poor Whiglington awoke, (This—unlike other vapour-devils—vanish'd not in smoke;) He rose up a fair Penitent, and saw the form depart, And vow'd the words of Bull would be engrav'd upon his heart: Engrav'd upon his heart, and death should blot it out alone,— (Engrav'd in Lithographic style—some hearts you know are stone.) Next morning Mr. Whiglington begg'd pardon of his wife, And told her he had now resolv'd on leading a new life; “Alas! the tide is turn'd,” he cry'd, “there's nothing to be got “By those who curse the Government,—so I will curse it not; “John Bull (my worthy visitor) has done his work so well, “Our weekly papers are become so weak they will not sell; “My pet review is drifting too, from fortune's fav'ring gale, “No wonder it drifts down the stream—for it has lost its sale; “The Champion faints,—and even the Examiner is willing “To examine us for seven pence, instead of for a shilling! “'Tis useless to abuse the King, we cannot now distress him, “Where'er he goes the people flock around him and cry, ‘God bless him!’ “In England they delight in him, for loyalty's in vogue, “And even in Hibernia they bless him in a brogue; “And should he come to Scotland, wife, the best thing we can do, “Is to ‘Tak a right good wylie wacht’—and cry, ‘God bless him’ too.” OUTLINE THE THIRD. “Oh, heavy lightness! serious vanity! “Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!” Romeo and Juliet. 'Tis half-past ten, and chairs and coaches hurry To the assembly rooms in George's Street; Some fair ones enter in a sort of flurry, Thinking of Beaus they may—or may not meet; Gow looks around, and after some demur, he Seizes his fiddle-stick, and takes his seat. The Patroness, who in the midst is seen, Feels (for the evening) every inch a queen. Here strangers will behold no kind M. C. No steward successive partners to insure; The room is fill'd with smiling Belles, but he Sees each Belle pass him silent, and demure, As if they all imagin'd him to be “A low born man, of parentage obscure”— A hermit in a ball-room, and though not “The world forgetting;—by the world forgot.” In fact, a stranger's prospects, cash, and rank, Should (in the style of Norval) be declar'd, “My Name is (so and so,) my prospects (blank), “My Father owns (blank) lands, a wealthy laird, “Whose constant savings hoarded in the bank, “Will by his only son (myself) be shar'd “With Her, who my affections can engage; “I am a single man, and just of age.” At private parties, servants should announce Our who's, and what's, and whence's, with our names: And Dowagers might then decide at once, With small deliberation, on our claims; 'Twould be so ludicrous to see them pounce Upon the images in gilded frames! Saying, before the victim dar'd to stir— “Permit me to present my daughter, Sir.” The Ball begins, quadrilles in triumph now Drive into shade the contre dance, and reel; Scotch feet forget the strathspey; and Scotch Gow In foreign airs reluctantly must deal; Each dancer moves with melancholy brow, And solemn form, and elephantic heel: With doleful looks chassezing right or left; As if of friends and kindred just bereft. But if they lapse into a reel by chance, Forgetting that quadrilles are thought more right; The awkward spell forsakes them, and they dance With life and spirit, and the toe is light And quite fantastic; and the merry glance Beams from each Scottish Lassie purely bright, Whilst hands and voices are uprais'd, to gain A faster fiddle, or a changing strain. (My gentle reader—do not call for salts, If waltzing's mention'd, do not faint away; I cannot understand a waltzer's faults, I'll argue on that point another day;) Here they at length have introduc'd the waltz, At least midst Fashion's votaries, for they “Can turn, and turn, and yet go on; and turn “Again”—(like Desdemona) as you'll learn. If in these places, you would wish to pass For something very tonish, and uncommon, Lounge at a door, and looking through your glass, Say, “'Pon my honour—that's a d—d fine woman;” Stare rudely at each Caledonian lass, And pray be careful that you speak to no man, Unless his coat looks London, and unless He knows (what few men do know) how to dress. If you would pass for something very high, When your progenitors are rather low; Pretend to be recherché, and pass by All unknown persons, whom you ought to know; I've Ladies—women rather—in my eye, Who do such things,—and if they serve me so, Why—let them cut, and welcome, I'll maintain It never shall be cut and come again. If you would pass for clever, you must gape When people speak to you, and not reply; Frown—and seem looking at some unseen shape, And they will think there's talent in your eye. When common-place men speak to you, escape And put yourself in attitudes, and sigh, Sneer upon those around,—as if you never Saw such absurdities,—they'll think you clever. If you would pass for a delightful man, Be scandalous, you're certain to succeed; Some folks there are, who gather all they can From those who tattle scandal;—if they read A volume penn'd on a satiric plan, They all declare 'tis very wrong indeed: Each shuts the book, exclaiming “I can see “That filthy character was meant for me.” And what have their employments been, who hate Him they believe the author? they all quiz And hint this Lady's origin, and state Their doubts respecting that, and say it is Strange t'other looks so pensive, and relate Tales of her spouse, and say the fault is his.— The author's wit is some excuse; they sit Venting the venom unredeem'd by wit. They have no souls for Music! I declare, I say it with regret; but in defiance Of Scotch claymores I positively swear They have no souls for music as a science; Their concerts are, alas! extremely rare, And I must say—(if I'm compell'd to fly hence For saying so,) 'tis true:—here vocal folks Soften no rocks, and bend no knotted oaks. I dearly love Scotch songs, when they are sung By Scottish voices, but the charm is gone, When English Ladies with an English tongue Attempt to quaver them; I freely own These lays to them exclusively belong; Their simple, touching, tenderness of tone Is charming, Lewy Gordon is divine, And nothing moves me more than Auld lang Syne. But Saint Cecilia they would not admire, Unless she came in bonnet, and in plaid; They would not listen to her heavenly lyre, So she must call the bagpipes to her aid; Tartans become her well; all I desire Is to behold the Maid at times array'd In other garbs; I wish not to new-fashion all, E'en bagpipes please me here, the noise is national. OUTLINE THE FOURTH. “What do you read, my Lord? “Words, words, words! “What is the matter?” Hamlet. A traveller always looks round him, to view Either persons, or places, or things that are new, To give a new turn to his thoughts, and secure A few novel touches to heighten his tour: I thus look around me, and there may be seen a Vast number of notable things in Edina. The craigs from their towering height, looking down On the buildings and smoke of the Old and New Town, Arthur's seat, like a giant, majestic and proud, Soaring high in the heavens, and crown'd with a cloud. And below the wild mixture of rock, hill, and dell, St. Anthony's chapel—St. Anton's pure well; Where I own that I almost expect to discern Effie Deans and her lover at every turn: And then Calton-hill with its exquisite view, And its lofty and slim Nelson's monument too; (A singular edifice rais'd for the dead,— Where the living find dinners at so much a head; A tavern and monument, strangely combin'd, Where soups, beef, and porter, are snugly enshrin'd.) It was lately put up by the taste of the town, And they're talking already of taking it down; 'Tis so near to the edge, if they leave it alone It threatens to sport a descent of its own; They laid out some money in placing it there; Query—What will it cost them to move it elsewhere? On that spot shall the Parthenon proudly arise, To charm Caledonian classical eyes; The Parthenon form'd on the model sublime, Of that Fane which outlives the rough usage of time; Alike in its structure, stupendous and solemn, In architrave, basement, frieze, cornice, and column, But free from pollution of heathenish sin, Without the vain worship of idols within. And yet in that National Fane may appear, Some names to all true Caledonians so dear; They might kneel on its pavement with pious emotion, And saints would declare it a blameless devotion; They would bend to no idols, cold, fragile, and hollow, No marble Diana,—no golden Apollo; They would bend to their fathers, whose valour or worth Had render'd them almost immortals on earth. And then there's the castle which seems to be part Of the rock which it springs from, for nature and art Have so closely cemented the rock and the stone, Time has mingled the whole mighty mass into one: And then there is Holyrood, once the resort Of the greatest, the gayest,—the pride of the court. There Mary—but hold, I leave others to sing Of what Holyrood was, 'tis an easier thing To describe what it is, while a sameness of gloom Spreads o'er the dark pannels of every room; And even the few regal relics still seen, But prove what a sad dreary change there has been. But this will be endless; I'm making my book A dull catalogue, shewing you where you should look For the lions;—and guide books will tell where they lye, And sketch books describe them far better than I. When looking for lodgings a stranger will see Some customs abstruse to a Southron like me. I saw “Lodgings” put up, and began to explore A dirty stone staircase; and came to a door, With a name, and a bell, and a scraper complete, (Like the doors which in England we have in the street.) I rung—and was told there were lodgings next door, So I turn'd, and went down the stone staircase once more; And I search'd the next house for these lodgings of theirs, But discover'd at length that next door meant up stairs; And on the next story I speedily came, To another street door with bell, scraper, and name; And if you go up eight or nine stories more, Each has scraper, and bell, and a perfect street door. This custom at first could not fail to create a Great marvel in me, for they all live in strata! One over another, from bottom to top, And beginning below with a stratum of shop! And the mixture is such that we often may see an Undoubted pure stratum, 'twixt strata plebeian: You may call on a friend of some ton, and discover him, With a shoemaker under, and a staymaker over him! My dwelling begins with a perriwig maker, I'm under a corncutter, over a baker; Above the chiropodist, cookery too; O'er that is a laundress, o'er her is a Jew; A painter, and tailor, divide the eighth flat, And a dancing academy thrives over that; We'll leave higher circles unnam'd:—T'other night My landlady enter'd my room in a fright, And cried, half in tears, with a face full of woe, “Your lumn's in a low, sir, your lumn's in a low.” I laugh'd in her face, for her hasty oration, To me, had convey'd very small information; Indignant she bawl'd, when she saw that I laugh'd, “You're foolish—your lumn's in a low—the man's daft!” “The baker! the over!”—I now comprehended, And join'd in the cry ere the uproar was ended, “The baker! the oven! oh, oh! is it so? “My chimney's on fire! my lumn's in a low!” The New Town is fine, and 'tis seldom one meets, With such long, and such spacious, and regular streets; But if you remain here in March, you will find, They expressly are built as conductors of wind; And while a dense cloud along Princes-street flies, You will peep at the beauties with dust in your eyes; The gales are tremendous, and every gust, Sends ashes to ashes, and adds dust to dust. The society here is divided in sets, And a man should be cautious at first, if he gets In a set which is doubtful, or not high enough, He in vain will endeavour to set himself off; Though he may be a gem, the good people forgetting The worth of the gem, only think of the setting. Few stars of first magnitude shine in this sphere; Second-rate ones are thought very luminous here; And if you mark second-rate stars, 'tis their plan To shine, and to twinkle as much as they can. And little high people astonish us greatly, They're vastly more wooden, reserv'd, stiff, and stately, Than those, who aware that there can be no doubt Of their sterling pretensions, let you find them out; Without a display of reserve, which receding From you—recedes equally far from good breeding. There's a coldness for ever unchangingly cool, Like the long chilling lapse of a morning at school; Freezing on—freezing on—by no kind look made pleasing, Till hopeless of comfort, we fly from the freezing. These are not the manners, oh, nothing like these, Which in greatness can make even dignity please, But the graceful good breeding, which never forgets Itself—or its guests.— —We were speaking of sets; A belle of one set, if she happens to hear Of a party or ball given out of her sphere; Cries, “really—we have not the honor of knowing “Those people; who are they? of course you're not going.” The others profess an indifference too,— “We are not acquainted, oh dear me, are you? “I never knew any of that set,—but if “I could go there,—I wou'dn't—you'll find it so stiff.” In all other respects, in its cards and quadrilles, In its “pretty well thank you's”—and “terrible ill's” In the exquisite near sighted beaus who advance, All hoping the honor of hands in the dance; In the Chaperons who patiently sit through a ball, Like tapestry hangings arrang'd round the wall; In the very queer fashions which ladies approve, Though like nothing in earth, nor the heavens above, In these, folly moves in the regular path, 'Tis “a picture in little” of London or Bath. But here they've no knockers! there can be no doubt That this greatly destroys the effect of a rout: The coachmen, and chairmen, and footmen, may bawl, They can scarcely disturb your next neighbour at all; Only think of a Dutchess from London! 'twould shock her To enter a room unannounc'd by the knocker! The actors are here much the same as elsewhere; They've the mothers so fond; and the daughters so fair; And the heiresses so very rich, its not known What they really possess,—all securely their own, And all the flash gentlemen dress'd out for show, So knowing—('tis hard to describe what they know;) In their stables they'll show you their nice bits of blood, As for study—they never get farther than stud. Some say, if you wish for hearts open and warm, Who will welcome a stranger in kindness, not form, And will give you a share in the homes they possess; Their homes undeform'd by its company dress; If you seek hospitality,—not the display Which receives you in form on a festival day; But that easy good nature towards strangers who roam Far—far from their own happy circles at home; Which so tenderly smiles, that your sadness is o'er, And the stranger—is nam'd as a stranger no more; If your heart sighs for kindness so warm, and endearing, —Take the steam-boat at Glasgow, and sail off to Erin. But hear not the slander, pause ere you depart, You may leave behind you much goodness of heart; And if they are fearful of loving too fast, The compliment's great—if they love you at last. OUTLINE THE FIFTH. “This fellow's wise enough to play the fool; “And to do that well, craves a kind of wit:— “He must observe their mood on whom he jests.” Twelfth Night. Walk not in Princes-street, if you would claim, Among recherchès people, a good name! Or if one hasty turn you're doom'd to take 'Midst frocks and coats of patriarchal make, Whose wearers prove to us the sad results Of lacking aid from Nugee, or from Stultz: 'Midst hats which Andre would think fit for brutes, 'Midst coverings for feet, instead of boots! Walk with a look of troubled agitation, As if you greatly fear'd contamination; If you meet ladies there, they blushing stop, And vow they're only going to a shop. They have no Mall for fashionable feet, No pure, and unobjectionable street; No proper lounge for each aspiring spark, No sweet equivalent for dear Hyde Park. One turn in Princes-street, for eating's sake, One single turn a man of ton may take, And sip,—displaying his unrivall'd form, The bounce of cherry, or a jelly warm; Or eating water ices in the summer, he May sigh for Grange, and substitute Montgomery. He may peep into Gow's for new quadrilles, Or buy the Sporting Magazine at Hill's; Then turn into the club and there remain Until Gianetti calls him forth again: Gianetti! man of curls! whose power is such, That bristles change to ringlets at his touch; Who gives a graceful wave to straightest hair, And makes the foppish fit to face the fair! Methinks I hear some Don of ancient date, With only some few hairs upon his pate, Exclaim with scornful shrug, and frowning brow, “Ah! all the men are empty coxcombs now.” But hold, my worthy gentleman! not so;— Do you remember, forty years ago— When some expert friseur, arrang'd three tiers Of round and comely curls above your ears? If they are fools—you once were foolish too, Be calm—they soon may be as bald as you. Here dinners duly are receiv'd, and given; The fed—and feeders keep the balance even; To (Blank) A dinner due, Be pleased to pay Value receiv'd on (such and such a day). No niggard hosts on thirsty guests bestow Their vile “unfriendly melancholy sloe” But with substantial luxuries, they sport, Champaign, and claret, and the best of port. But oh! ere dinner comes! what pen hath power To paint the horrors of that dull half hour! Whene'er day closes, ladies sit array'd In garments which for candle light were made, And e'er the tables groan with weighty feasts, With weighty conversation groan the guests, Between the courses—they must groan again, Or “drag at each remove a lengthening chain.” The Theatre is small,—if it succeeded Better—'twould prove a larger one was needed, But no!—from ball to ball, from rout to rout, From feast to feast—the gay ones fly about; To see the present ball reflect the past, And every rout a ditto of the last; Each feast like former feasts—except the room, The same young ladies, in the same costume; The same quadrilles, and with the same grimaces, The same sweet dimples, on the same sweet faces; The same remarks, and from the self same voices, The same ice creams, and cakes! yet this their choice is To be to-night—where nightly they have been,— While Mrs. Henry Siddons shines unseen! Siddons! whose graceful form assumes at will A gay or pensive part with equal skill; In tragic characters she reigns alone, The gentle Juliets now are all her own: In Lady Townly,—in the Jealous Wife, In all the Dames of fashionable life, Each look, each tone, is lady-like;—in fact She really is—what others only act. You may go on in London as you please; You may be queer, yet neighbours never teaze; They make no memorandums if you roam, And utter no remarks when you come home; They do too much to note what others do, And see too many sights, to think of you. But here the sphere is so confin'd, and small, That one man's actions are discuss'd by all; Like cool refreshments at a crowded rout,— The spirit stirring scandal moves about; The sly remark—that certain people deem That certain people are not what they seem; Adding that certain other people know They are—or were—or will be—so and so!— The hint that some fair maid, though still the rage, Has certainly attain'd a certain age; The confidential whispers of the day, Still whisper'd in a confidential way; Till confidants the whispers wide diffuse And all the smiling circle shares the news. And must all parties then be dull to us 'Till conversation has been season'd thus? 'Till in detraction's pepper we have revell'd, And half the words we utter have been devill'd? Their mite of mischief must all guests bestow With all they've heard—as well as all they know. Is there no cure? yes one: we all should dread, To wantonly speak evil of the dead! Yet surely folks defunct could best endure To be so treated!—This then is the cure: To say no more than we're convinc'd is true, Just to the dead and to the living too. I'll moralize no more,—I now intend To bring these hasty outlines to an end. As some mamma draws forth with glistening eyes Her child's portfolio of ample size, And thrusts upon a stranger, one by one, The paint, or pencil outlines of her son; Which though all dear to her maternal breast, Possess but few attractions for her guest;— So—but I'll veil my simile,—no doubt If it applies,—the world will find it out. THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. LINES WRITTEN ON LEAVING A WATERING PLACE. Adieu, gay scenes; and oh! adieu Cheeks brown and fair, eyes black and blue: And take a parting sigh from me, Harper, and flute, and fiddlers three: To sweet sequester'd shades I go, But not on light fantastic toe; With leaden footstep, I shall seek Lanes long, and lonely;—this day week! Here all will then be fair and bright, Beneath as soft a candlelight; And beaus and belles will dance about, A few with grace,—a few without; Here tutor'd feet will lightly skip, And rose bud lips weak tea will sip; And fascinated eyes will seek For pretty partners—this day week! The kindling lamps will beam as soon, The band will play as sweet a tune; Delighted swains will rove about, And lead delighted damsels out; Beaus the fair hands of belles will touch, And whisper nothings—meaning much; And some in louder tone will speak, Unmeaning somethings—this day week! And say will one remember then, A man—the most forlorn of men; Who goes upon four wheels away, Because he must not—dare not stay? Will some fair nymph with eager glance, Search for his figure in the dance, And then will sorrow shade her cheek When he is absent—this day week? No—not a belle who then glides in, Will make a point of looking thin;— No hollow eyes of him bereft Will turn aside from right and left; No wasted form will steps forget, And feebly totter through pousette, Or for his sake with changing cheek, Go to the bottom—this day week! No! not a charm will cease to be, No ringlets will uncurl for me; No form will shrivel for my sake, No smile will fade, no heart will break: Here all will then as lightly pass, Though I shall be turn'd out to grass; Oh! in the shades I'll die with pique, I'll blow my brains out—this day week. My head a green grass turf shall own, And at my quiet heels a stone; For on your head no rose I'll view, And at your heels no satin shoe; Then I shall have no power to steal A look at your divine profile; I shall not scent your huile antique, Nor tie your cloak on—this day week! My feet I shall not then inclose, In dancing pumps, nor silken hose; But muddy pathways I shall choose, In most exceedingly thick shoes: This waistcoat white as unsunn'd snow, Shall to my old portmanteau go; Another waistcoat I'll bespeak, I'll buy a straight one—this day week. I rave, I rave, just now I said A green grass turf should grace my head; And when men sleep in such a spot, Waistcoats, and coats become them not: But if you should forget me here, My pallid phantom shall appear; While lights burn blue, my voice shall speak And scare your senses—this day week. Just as the steward has call'd a dance, My apparition shall advance; While harmony forsakes each fiddle, My bones shall rattle down the middle; I'll lead you out!—each step we take, The sea shall foam, the earth shall quake! Tea cups shall crack, and glasses leak Containing negus—this day week! August, 1820. AN ADDRESS, Spoken by Mr. Bartley before the Tragedy of Adelighita, at Mrs. Bartley's benefit, to introduce a young Lady in the character of Imma. (Mr. B. just shows his head at the stage door.) Stop, Mr. Leader—can't you stop a minute? I've got a speech to speak, and must begin it; Imma's quite dress'd—and Michael Ducas partly, Lothair is talking stuff to Mrs. Bartley; Pray cease—and lay aside your violin— The Manager declares I must begin: (Enters.) Ladies! before yon curtain shall arise To cause your sobs, your sympathies, and sighs; Before poor Mrs. Adelghita's griefs Call forth your extra pockethandkerchiefs, And Lewis shows you in his Tale of Terrors, How single belles, should shrink from single errors,— I come—a kind reception to implore, For one, who never ventur'd here before; Who unaccustom'd to fictitious tears, Now shrinks with real doubts, and real fears. The debutante was a very celebrated harp player.She is no stranger here; in former days The young Musician oft receiv'd your praise, And now she throws aside her harp to choose The nobler pleasures of the sister muse: Her touch was sweet, nor has she lost her skill, I hope you'll find the minstrel touching still, And though in new and untried paths she's straying, Perhaps without her harp, you'll praise her playing. Then ladies! pray be kind, but hold! I know That prayer is needless,—you are always so; And gentlemen!—pray let us hope to find That you're to-night less critical than kind: I beg—but no! I'll beg applause from no man, You must be kind—the novice is a woman. Ask not a mien from error quite exempt, Seek not perfection in a first attempt; The voice will lose its strength and firmness too, When inexperienc'd youth first faces you: The heart will palpitate, the cheek will burn, 'Till your applause bids confidence return. The noble ship first launch'd upon the tide Tosses with every breeze from side to side; Turns to and fro, with undirected motion, A useless mass upon the foaming ocean; But ably manag'd every storm she braves, She sails to glory, and she rules the waves! We have a launch to-night; with sails unfurl'd, She comes upon a new, a dangerous world; Be you her pilots, give her welcome here, Let sunshine gild the dawn of her career, Hereafter on your present smiles relying, Perhaps she'll sail away with colours flying. And now my task is done; yet can I see Yon crowded circles look so kind on me, And yet of Imma's feelings speak alone? Ah no! let gratitude pour forth my own, And hers, who well remembers, when she came Like this young candidate for future fame, As young—as fearful—'till your smiles remov'd All fears—and rais'd her in the course she lov'd. This is the place where by your favor first Her hopes were kindled, and her talents nurs'd; And oh may every wanderer, who strays Far from the patrons of his early days, Should fate conduct him homeward, proudly find, His former friends thus eloquently kind; May beauty, smiles, and worth surround him thus, And give him all the joy—you give to us. PŒSTUM. What tow'ring Fanes through countless ages spar'd, Stand on you plain in grandeur unimpair'd! No rich proportions of Corinthian style, No lighter graces deck the noble pile; But rais'd in Doric mould, those massive forms, Have brav'd the warfare of a thousand storms. Amid the wreck where stone is hurl'd from stone, In undiminish'd strength they stand alone; Still may each simple ornament be trac'd, Each touch which time has soften'd, not effac'd; Though o'er their front age spreads a wild flower wreath, The fluted marble rests unchang'd beneath. Here Posidonia rose, her dawning sway Shone o'er the waters of yon lovely bay;— Still in the midst yon circling ruins The ruins of an amphitheatre remain, the walls of the city may be traced, and are in some places six feet high. serve To mark the arena's wide extending curve: These walls once echo'd all the busy strife, The joys, the fears, the schemes of human life; Ambition's dream, the warrior's dauntless soul, The poet's fancy spurning earth's control; And beauty—matchless in her bright career, And deem'd almost immortal—triumph'd here:— Those triumphs are no more,—those forms are flown, And Time's dark mantle clothes the crumbling stone. Mighty in arms the Roman conqu'ror came, And chang'd her laws, her language, and her name; Augustan minstrels in a foreign tongue, Of Pœstum's twice expanding roses Virgil and Ovid mention the roses of Pœstum which bloomed twice every year. sung; Or chose her violets meek unearthly hue, Martial. And rank'd their sweets with hybla's honied dew. Her children, outcasts in their native home, Shrunk from the sound of Pœstum and of Rome. While o'er that home by youthful hopes endear'd, Triumphant foes their eagle banners rear'd. Yet still the vanquish'd natives yearly met, And talk'd of days—the heart can ne'er forget; Still murmur'd Posidonia's name The Romans on conquering Posidonia changed its name to Pœstum, and also changed its language. But at a yearly festival the old inhabitants met and spoke in their native tongue. Athenæus XIV. with tears, And spoke the language of their happier years. Soon all was chang'd, each sound of life was hush'd, The ruthless Arab o'er the ramparts rush'd; Pœstum was afterwards conquered by the Saracens, who entered it at midnight, and burnt the city. The brand was hurl'd, and like the struggling breath— The last convulsive energies of death;— With fatal splendour fir'd, her towers illume The mountains, and the waves, and all is gloom. All save yon lonely forms which stand on high, In Doric strength, and bold simplicity, O'er these the with'ring flame, the wintry blast, And desolation's terrors powerless pass'd; As if their Gods with tutelary sway, Watch'd o'er the sacred pile, to shield it from decay. LINES TO A FRIEND IN AFFLICTION. Let not your spirit be depress'd, Though sorrow now obscures your way; Hope must not leave so young a breast, Hope still may paint a brighter day. Repeat not now the sad amount Of pleasures past; that task is vain; But turn to cheering thoughts, and count The joys, and friends that yet remain. Though former dreams of bliss depart, One pang at least you have not known; Their loss indeed might wound your heart, If caus'd by follies of your own. A youthful soul should ne'er despond, Grief soon forsakes a guiltless brow; Be nobly firm; and look beyond The shadows that surround you now. Look to the friends whose ardent zeal The day of trial summons forth; Look to the friends that warmly feel, And dry the tears of suffering worth. As those who guard from rain, and cold, Some tender plant in wintry hours; With more than common joy behold, The beauty of its summer flowers: So will your friends enraptur'd view All sorrows from your course remove; And think each virtue own'd by you, An overpayment of their love. TO ANNA And must I now restore again Those gifts still dear to me? Shall no memento now remain, To waken thoughts of thee? Then take them back; I cannot know More grief, since thou art gone; Yet I will view them ere they go, And kiss them one by one. Take back thy Picture; feebly trac'd Thy form is copy'd there; And my first gift, the rose, is plac'd Amid thy clustering hair: Thy smiling eyes' unearthly blue Defy'd the artist's skill; Yet since those eyes I cannot view, I'll keep the copy still. Take back the Ring, which never yet Hath left me night or day; This heart, alas! can ne'er forget, Though relics pass away: Take back the ring—but, oh! too tight, Too well it fits to move! If Time can hands and rings unite, Time ought to strengthen Love. Take back the Ivory Tablet too, It trembles in my grasp; Tears have not chang'd its snowy hue, Nor soil'd its silver clasp: Its page records my faithful vow, My love—my loss—my grief; But hold—that theme's forbidden now, I must not send that leaf. Take back the Box, where link'd in one, Our names together twine; The only place where now your own Can ne'er be torn from mine: Yet some, with alter'd glance, may find Our names united thus; I'll keep the gift,—it calls to mind The joys they snatch'd from us. No, Anna, no! though you return Each pledge of mine again, I gaze on yours, and strive to learn The same sad task—in vain; Endear'd by former hours of bliss Those gifts were priz'd before; Endear'd by all the gloom of this, I prize them more and more. The trifling toys which you resign, Shall never leave me now; To deck a form less fair than thine, Or pledge a second vow: To none but thee my lips repeat The tale my passion told; For none but thee my heart shall beat, Till that sad heart is cold. They bid me seek, in change of scene, Forgetfulness of thee; When wilds and waters intervene They'll find no change in me; When one deep sorrow rules the heart, No cure in flight is found; A wounded man may shun the dart, But still retains the wound. What hope can now my grief console, Amid life's darkening sea? What cherish'd thought sustains my soul? My confidence in thee. I'll ne'er believe thy future choice Will bless a happier youth; I'd silence e'en a friendly voice, If it should doubt thy truth. And though my duty bids me now All former claims resign, Though I absolve thee from thy vow, I cannot cancel mine. Before we met, Love ne'er gave birth To one fond smile or tear; And when we met, I felt that Earth Held nothing half so dear. A SEA-SIDE REVERIE. Originally published in Blackwood's Magazine. “The voices of the dead, and songs of other years.” Heber. Is there a place where the souls of the just, Forsaking mortality's loathsome dust, In purity rest till that awful day, When this sorrowing world shall pass away? When after this short life's terrible close, And after death's icy and dark repose, The good and the guilty that trump shall hear— A summons of joy, or a sound of fear— That last loud trump, whose awakening call Shall proclaim the eternal doom of all. Is there a place where the spirits of bliss Can look down on a world so sad as this? Where, with purest love, they behold the worth Of the faithful hearts whom they left on earth? Or can the soul's intellectual flame Lie torpid and cold with man's mortal frame, Like that in corruption's arms to await, An endless pain, or a happier state? Can the mind of man, the immortal soul, Which on earth seems bounding from earth's control— Can that spirit by death to flesh be link'd All its ardour quench'd, and its hope extinct? Oh, no! there's a bright and a blissful sphere, Where it soars when freed from its bondage here; And it soothes the mourner's heart to think While in tears he bends o'er the cold grave's brink— It soothes his sorrowing heart to know, Though the form he lov'd may moulder below— The spirit he lov'd—the immortal part— The truth, and the love, and the goodness of heart, And the faith which raises the mind to God— These never can rest in death's dark abode; And though mortal eyes cannot pierce the gloom, The mysterious realms beyond the tomb— Though we know too well, that when life is o'er The lov'd ones depart, and are seen no more— Yet we feel (and there's comfort in feeling thus) They live, though unheard and unseen by us; And we think, though freed from all earthly ill, They hover in pity around us still. Oh! who that has rov'd by the pale moon's light, In the deep repose of a summer's night— When the gray mist rests on the meadows green, And the distant mountains are dimly seen— When the sea in its rage resounds no more, But in murmuring whispers seeks the shore, As calm, as if ever at rest, it flows, The faithless calm of a lion's repose— When the tranquil wind is so soft and weak, That there's warmth in the breeze that fans your cheek— When nothing is heard but the sea-bird's note, Or a lively song from a fisherman's boat, Or the rills which, gushing through arching caves, At intervals drip in the dark blue waves:— Oh! who that has rov'd in a night like this, And thought of the phantoms of boyish bliss— When every thought must have caus'd a sigh, And a burning tear for days gone by— Oh! who has not gaz'd on the clear sky then, With thoughts never utter'd, though felt by men, Till his heart was sad, and his eyes were dim, And the scenes of this world were lost to him; And, unaided by sight, he seem'd to view Realms deep in the sky's dark beautiful blue— Realms brighter than all he had thought most bright— Delightful, exceeding this world's delight; With all that his youth thought purest and best, Made purer and better—by angels blest. With feelings like these, I have often stood Near the ocean, in night's calm solitude, And gaz'd from the beach and its sounding surge, To the misty horizon's utmost verge, Where one soften'd tint is perceiv'd alone, And water and sky seem to melt in one; And then while the tremulous moonbeams shine On the waves, in a dazzling and golden line, Which, unquench'd and glowing, appears to glide Like a lava stream through the darker tide: Then, whilst on the waters I mutely gaze, I think of the pleasures of other days; And the faces and forms so sadly dear: And the words I heard, but no more can hear; And the tales that can never again be told; And the pressure of hands that now are cold;— 'Tis then we encourage the fond belief, That those whom we grieve for behold our grief; That from them we receive the Hope, which takes The severest pang from a heart that aches; And when we remember that they are blest, And that we are in sorrow, we feel 'tis best To follow their steps in Death's awful track, Without one selfish wish to call them back. RETROSPECTION. WRITTEN AT WINCHESTER. Like the successive clouds, that fly Across an April morning sky, Mingling in a few short hours, The brightest rays, and darkest show'rs, Thus varied are the days I've seen, Thus fleeting have my moments been; Dangerous when dazzling most, Scarce present, ere for ever lost. Sometimes tranquil, and serene; Sometimes sad my hours have been; Sometimes gloomy, sometimes gay, Months and years have pass'd away. How swift on Time's unceasing wave, We glide from childhood to the grave! Hour by hour,—and day by day, The happy dreams of youth decay; For present ills a balm we borrow, In expectation of to-morrow; Yet still alas! to-morrow's sun, Finds us in sorrow journeying on. Forgetful of life's former gloom, We live in hopes of joy to come; Till imperceptibly our prime, Is wither'd by the storms of Time. Hope builds some fair and flimsy scheme, And disappointment ends the dream; We mourn awhile for visions gone, Time sooths us,—and we still hope on! Poor mortals! thus the ants prepare Their little nests with busy care; Too soon may truant's footsteps spoil The cells they form'd with so much toil; They build—and find their labour vain— The fabric falls,—they build again. Winton! these feelings are more sage, More fit for my maturer age, Than those wild thoughts for ever past, Which charm'd me when I left thee last: More sage—more sad; and it were strange, If fleeting years had wrought no change, And I could wander here, and find The boyish heart I left behind. Yes, here I rove, but there are none Who knew me here, they all are gone; All the young crew, the best, the worst, The gayest—wildest—all disperst! I stand alone, and find the place Devoted to another race; Who gaze at me with boyish air; The counterparts of what we were. Yes, o'er the field we sported thus, As if the world were made for us; Earth's brightest joy, a noisy play, And life's best gift—a holiday! Too soon does boyhood's artless grace To manhood's lofty form give place; And manhood's spirit,—vigour, strength, To feeble age must yield at length: But thoughtless boyhood is array'd With more of sunshine, less of shade; Than we e'er view upon the page Of manhood, or declining age: Warm imagination, then Overlooks the ills of men; And glancing o'er the prospect wide, Dwells only on the brightest side. SUPPOSED TO BE WRITTEN BY ? Is she another's!—Is she not Still mine, still constant,—still the same! Can she,—can Rosa have forgot My love—my fond acknowledg'd claim. From her own lips the tale must come, From her—who if that tale be truth; Has thrown a dark—a chilling gloom O'er the fair prospects of my youth. Rosa must tell of shame like this, Her foes would seek belief in vain; If she has clos'd my dawning bliss, She will not shudder at my pain. She must convince me that the past, Was all delusion,—all mistake! And I perhaps may learn at last, To love deceit—for Rosa's sake. Let none to me her faults impart, I mourn'd those faults,—but never blam'd; And though her follies break my heart, I will not hear those follies nam'd. Ah! when I think the time has been When I was flatter'd, and preferr'd;— The fascinating smiles I've seen,— The fond—unmeaning vows I've heard. Those smiles so beautifully sweet,— Those vows implicitly believ'd; Oh! if they were indeed deceit, 'Tis dreadful to be undeceiv'd. Perhaps my tongue but faintly told The tale—it scarcely dar'd to tell; Perhaps she thought my manner cold, Too cold for one who lov'd her well. But hope and joy were then at stake, My fate upon her answer hung; Ah! surely Rosa then might make Excuses for a faltering tongue. Why is it that when hearts adore One faultless mind; one form, one face; If love is cross'd—they love no more— Another ne'er can fill the place. Is it because in after years, We seek its counterpart in vain; Youth quits his dream of love with tears, And trembles e'er he trusts again. May my gay rival's love protect The treasure I must now renounce; Nor cause her by unkind neglect To sigh for him she valu'd once. I must forget her now—but no! I feel that this can never be:— The last—best wish I can bestow, Is—that she ne'er may think of me. WRITTEN WHEN ABSENT FROM ANNA. Whate'er our fate may be, 'tis sweet to think We are not quite forgotten when we rove; We cannot be quite wretched, if one link Still binds us to a being we can love: In town, or solitude, in camp or grove, Who would not wish some lovely hand to trace Our distant wanderings, where'er we move? E'en home itself must be a distant place, Till brighten'd by the smile of some familiar face. He who has lov'd, must know too well how soon A trifling circumstance may throw a shade Upon his pleasure.—A remember'd tune Recalls the image of some fav'rite maid, Who danc'd it with him; then how quickly fade The noise and bustle of the festive night! The ball, the play, the lively serenade, And ev'ry moment of their past delight, In one swift glance of thought were brought before his sight. He who has never lov'd, can never know Feelings like these: his soul can ne'er aspire Beyond realities of joy and woe; Self is the aim and end of his desire: But love's imagination soars far higher; Its sorrows are more keen, but it o'erpays All sense of sorrow with affection's fire: Tempests and sun-beams mingle in his ways; Who would not have his storms, to bask beneath his rays? He who has flown with rapture to receive A long expected letter; he can tell What bliss a line from her he loves can give; And though upon the page perhaps may dwell The sad expressions of a fond farewell; He finds in every accent of despair, A fond assurance that she loves him well: And while he reads the tokens of her care, He almost views the form of her who plac'd them there. Dear is the occupation which he heard Her lips approve, and precious to him then The volumes she perus'd, for every word Which she has look'd upon, appears to gain A magic force; as if it could retain The lustre of her glances. Love has thrown A spell o'er all she did, her songs remain Sweetest to him; a sweetness not their own; 'Tis that her lips have left a charm on every tone. FINTS</field>
