Why delve, and moil, and pine, To glut the tyrant-forgers of your chain? Slaves, toil no more! Up, from the midnight mine, Summon your swarthy thousands to the plain; Beneath the bright sun marshalled, swell the strain Of liberty; and, while the lordlings view Your banded hosts, with stricken heart and brain, Shout, as one man,—‘Toil we no more renew, Until the Many cease their slavery to the Few!’ 2 “‘We'll crouch, and toil, and weave, no more—to weep!’ Exclaim your brothers from the weary loom: Yea, now, they swear, with one resolve, dread, deep, “We'll toil no more—to win a pauper's doom!’ And, while the millions swear, fell Famine's gloom Spreads from their haggard faces like a cloud Big with the fear and darkness of the tomb. How, 'neath its terrors, are the tyrants bowed! Slaves, toil no more—to starve! Go forth and tame the Proud! 3 And why not tame them all? Of more than clay Do your high lords proclaim themselves? Of blood Illustrious boast they? or, that reason's ray Beams from the brows of Rollo's robber-brood “Rollo's robber- brood” was intended as a compliment to the English nobility, so many of whom claim to be descended, in common with William the Bastard, their brigand chief, from the soldiers of Rollo the Norman. Mr. Disraeli, however, seems to be of opinion that these pretensions to chivalrous descent deserve no credit; and, surely, he is an authority on such a subject. “I have always understood,” said Coningsby, “that our peerage was the finest in Europe.” “From themselves,” said Millbank, “and the heralds they pay to paint their carriages. But I go to facts. When Henry the Seventh called his first Parliament, there were only twenty-nine temporal peers to be found, and even some of them took their seats illegally, for they had been attainted. Of those twenty-nine not five remain, and they, as the Howards for instance, are not Norman nobility. We owe the English peerage to three sources: the spoliation of the Church; the open and flagitious sale of its honours by the elder Stuarts; and the boroughmongering of our own times.” — Coningsby, vol ii., chap. 4. More brightly than from yours? Let them make good Their vaunt of nobleness—or now confess The majesty of ALL! Raise ye the feud— Not, like their sires, to murder and possess; But for unbounded power to gladden and to bless. 4 What say ye,—that the priests proclaim content? So taught their Master, who the hungry fed As well as taught; who wept with men, and bent, In gentleness and love, o'er bier and bed Where wretchedness was found, until it fled! Rebuked he not the false ones, till his zeal Drew down their hellish rage upon his head? And who, that yearns for world-spread human weal, Doth not, ere long, the weight of priestly vengeance feel? 5 Away!—the howl of wolves in sheep's disguise Why suffer ye to fill your ears?—their pride Why suffer ye to stalk before your eyes? Behold, in pomp, the purple prelate ride, And, on the beggar by his chariot's side Frown sullenly, although in rags and shame His brother cries for food! Up, swell the tide Of retribution, till ye end the game Long practised by proud priests in meek Religion's name. 6 Slaves, toil no more! Despite their boast, ev'n kings Must cease to sit in pride,—without your toil: Spite of their potency,—the sceptred things Who through all time, have thirsted to embroil Man with his neighbour, and pollute the soil Of holiest mother Earth with brothers' gore,— Join but to fold your hands, and ye will foil To utter helplessness,—yea, to the core Strike both their power and craft with death! Slaves, toil no more!”— 7 For that these words of fire I boldly spake To Labour's children in their agony Of want and insult; and, like men awake After drugged slumbers, they did wildly flee To do they knew not what,—until, with glee, A store of maddening alcohol they found, And with its poison fired their misery To fierce revenge,—swift hurling to the ground And flames—dwellings, and lifeless things that stood around;— 8 For that I boldly spake these words of fire; And the starved multitude,—their minds full fraught With sense of injury, and wild with ire,— Rushed forth to deeds of recklessness, but nought Achieved of freedom, since, nor plan, nor thought Their might directed;—for this treason foul 'Gainst evil tyrants, I was hither brought A captive,—'mid the vain derisive howl Of some who thought the iron now should pierce my soul. 9 Let them howl on! Their note, perchance, may change The earthquake oft is presaged by dull rest: Kings may, to-morrow, feel its heavings strange! For my lorn dove, who droopeth in her nest, I mourn, in tenderness; but, to this breast Again to clasp my meek one I confide With fervid trustfulness! Still self-possest, Since Truth shall one day triumph,—let betide What may, within these bars in patience I can 'bide. 10 I had a vision, on my prison-bed, Which took its tinct from the mind's waking throes. Of patriot blood on field and scaffold shed; Of martyrs' ashes; of the demon foes Ubiquitous, relentless, that oppose And track, through life, the footsteps of the brave Who champion Truth; of Evil that arose Within the universe of Good, and gave To sovereign Man the soul to live his brother's slave; 11 Of knowledge which, from sire to son bequeathed, Hath ever on the Few with bounty smiled; But, on the Many, wastingly hath breathed A pestilence, from the scourged crowd that piled, Of yore, the pyramids, to the dwarfed child Whose fragile bloom steam and starvation blast; Of specious arts, whereby the bees beguiled, Yield to the sable drones their sweet repast, And creep, themselves, the path to heaven by pious fast; 12 Of infamy for him who gives himself A sacrifice to stem the tyrant's rage; And, for the tyrant's pandar,—peerage, pelf, And honours blazed with lies on history's page; Of giant Wrong who, fed, from age to age, With man's best blood and woman's purest tears, Seems with our poor humanity to wage Exterminating war; of hopes and fears That mock the human worm from youth to grayest years; 13 I, waking, thought or dreamt,—for thoughts are dreams At best,—until, in weariness of heart, I cried—Is life worth having? Earth but teems With floods of evil: 'tis one sordid mart Where consciences for gold, without a smart, Are sold; and holiest names are gravest cheats: Men from their cradles, learn to play a part At plundering each other: He who beats, On his weak neighbour, swift, the plundering trick repeats. 14 Is life worth having? Or, is he most wise Who, with death-potion its fierce fever slakes, And ends, self-drugged, his mortal miseries? Can he be guilty who, at once, forsakes The agony which, sure as death, o'ertakes, Early or late, all who with wrong contend? Since Power this earth a clime of misery makes For him who will not to its godhead bend— Why to the enfranchised grave with sluggish footsteps wend? 15 Thus feebly pondering, with sore-troubled brain, The right of suffering man to consummate, Unsummoned, his high trust, my heart grew fain To slay the incubus that on it sate, Breeding disgust of life and jaundiced hate. Forthwith, I strove the mind's turmoil to quell By imaging that joy all-elevate Which through earth's universal heart shall swell When over land and sea hath rung Oppression's knell. 16 But sadness checked the strain. Enfevered Sleep, With tardy foot, came last; and, while she bound My limbs in outward death, within the deep Recesses of the brain into life wound These aching thoughts; yea, into shapes that frowned Or smiled, by turns, with seeming passion rife, And descant joined on human themes, though sound Of human voice none uttered:'twas the strife Of Mind, not audible by mode of mortal life.— 17 Methought I voyaged in the bark of Death,— Himself the helmsman,—on a skyless sea, Where none of all his passengers drew breath, Yet each, instinct with strange vitality, Glared from his ghastly eye-balls upon me, And then upon that pilot, who upheld One chill and fleshless hand so witheringly That, while around his boat the hoarse waves swelled, It seemed as if their rage that solemn signal quelled. 18 I know not how these mariners I saw: No light made visible the grisly crew: It seemed a vision of the soul, by law Of corporal sense unfettered, and more true Than living things revealed to mortal view. Nor can earth's Babel-syllables unfold Aught that can shadow forth the mystic hue Of myriad creatures, or their monstrous mould, Which thwart that dismal sea their hideous hugeness rolled. 19 Not stature terrible of mastodon Or mammoth; longitude of lizards vast, Lords of the slime when earth, from chaos won, Grew big with primal life, until, aghast, She quaked at her strange children; not all past Or present, which from out the dædal earth, The human reptile, latest born, hath classed By guess, styling it ‘Knowledge,’ for the mirth Of future worms, crawling, in pride to death—from birth; 20 Not old leviathan, of bulk uncouth; Nor fabled kraken, with his sea-borne trail; Not all that sages tell, in sober sooth, Of the sun's progeny on Memphic vale, Which from redundant Nile his beams exhale; Not all that phrenzied poets exorcise From memory's grave, then weave with fancies frail; Can image, in their span, or shapes, or dyes, Those ocean-dwellers huge beholding Death's emprize. 21 The voyage, voyagers, and ocean-forms, Alike, were strange, and wild, and wonderful. But marvels grew! When, of that sea of storms We reached the shore, the waves at once were lull; Death and his skiff evanished, and seemed null And void as things that never were; while they, Of late Death's passengers, so cold and dull, Took, with an air of stern resolve, their way Into a gloomy land where startling visions lay. 22 All that Death's ocean showed of hideousness By living forms in lifeless shapes found here Its paragon: it was a crude excess Of all things dern and doleful, dark and drear: No sun to fructify, no flowers to cheer Its sullen barrenness: weeds, huge and dank, And blossomless as stones, and ever sere, Base sustenance from stagnant waters drank,— Then spread throughout the plain their poisonous perfume rank. 23 Damp, dense, and deathly, yet the climate parched Those silent travellers, sore, with raging thirst; But sickening at the slimy pools, they marched Onward, enfevered, fainting; 'till outburst Their burning tongues, as doth a hound's when curst With madness. Path across that dismal land Was none; and though no life its waters nursed, Yet were there fearful sights, on either hand, That much affrayed the courage of that ghastly band. 24 Chasms yawned, like dragon's jaws, from what seemed rock, Then closed, with sulphurous smell, and horrid jar, And uprose giant cliffs, to gibe and mock, As if with demon features,—while, afar, Appeared colossal meteors for wild war Gathering their troops terrific, which came on With fury, but, like some portentous star That fear-struck men gaze after—and—'tis gone! Vanished those vaporous hosts in that unearthly zone. 25 Then felt the fainting footmen as if yoked To viewless vehicles they could not move; Yet, fastened by a galling chain, half-choked, They still to drag their unseen burden strove, Till the wild crags came toppling from above, Threatening to crush the strugglers into nought; When lo! some airy necromancy wove Around their trembling limbs, with speed of thought, A web of gossamer with wizard safety fraught: 26 And now, as if above the rocks upborne— Suspended in mid-air—with vision dazed, And swimming brain—past rescue, doomed, forlorn— For some unspeakable perdition raised, They seemed; but suddenly, let down, amazed Their forms engulphed amid the swamps beheld,— Where, while they clung unto the weeds, and gazed Upward, in hope to climb, some weird hand felled Their grasp, and o'er their heads the poisoned waters welled 27 Yet on dry land, as speedily they stood,— Where they again their venturous march prepared, While apparitions from the stagnant flood And murky air, unto the travellers bared Increasing horrors, as they onward fared.— Ye may a jest this dreaming rhyme esteem: But these strange terrors my rapt spirit shared; And, though it was the journey of a dream, Had ye thus dreamt, no jest ye would that journey deem. 28 A cavern's mouth, browed by a giant mound, Gave welcome respite to their torturous toil: For, entering there, the way-worn wanderers found The semblance of a subterraneous aisle, And walked admiringly, yet feared, the while, Sudden renewal of their suffering plight, Or deeper woe whelmed 'neath the rocky pile: But, midst their fears, sense of unearthly light Dawned, with a thrill of ease, upon their anxious sight. 29 Above them curved the likeness of a roof Of woven rock,—strange supernatural glare Diffusing from its tracery, that seemed woof Of masonry more mystical and rare Than devotees of proud cathedralled prayer Witness while worshipping the Nazarene: Pride lauding lowliness! And past compare Of monkish mixtures were the shapes, I ween, Of shaft and capital, that 'long that vault were seen. 30 Not, as with fashion of that gloomy age When Phantasy, in convent bondage bred, Drew graces from distraction,—mingling rage Grotesque of apes with ire of angels dread,— Aiming all contraries to blend and wed, Until with hybrids she had filled the mind, And with wild wonderment its powers misled, So that, its grasp grown loose and undefined, The shaven and shorn enchanters might its freedom bind; 31 Not, as with fashion of that twilight time When sky-born Truth, by priestly hands arrayed In vulgar vestments of the motley mime, Played conjurer in “dim religious” shade,— And peasant thrall, by bell and book dismayed, Glanced tremblingly on corbel, niche, and pane, Where imp, saint, angel, knight with battle-blade, Griffin, bat, owlet, more befooled the swain, Till, when the incense fumed, round swum his wildered brain; 32 Not, after pattern of old monkish mode; Not, as by wand of mitred magic hung, The rocky arch that mystic aisle bestrode,— While clustered shaft and twisted pillar sprung Forth from the floor,—and floral festoons flung Their crystal witchery from base to quoin,— And ever-changing shapes in antics clung To shaft and capital, festoon and groin,— Seeming all forms of life, all grace of flowers to join; 33 But unimagined, unconceived, unknown, Unspeakable, by man, seemed all revealed To those awed travellers, as they journeyed on Through that vast aisle, that rather glowed a field Of caverned wonders, where each shape did yield For evermore new changes,—till the soul, Enervate with o'erpiled amazement reeled And sank, wishing an end unto her dole Of wondering—pining, now, for prospect of her goal. 34 Anon, we entered where the travellers took Their silent way, each to some several home. Light fled; and dim funereal gloom rewoke A solemn sadness through my essence. Dome, Or cupola, scooped in mid rock, like tomb Primeval, high above me stretched its span Gigantic, vague,—appearing to enwomb A space so vast that there old Death divan Might hold, in mausoleum metropolitan. 35 Innumerable aisles their paths diverse Forth from this sombrous centre led. And now, I first perceived, from law which did coerce The vagrant ghosts who reached these realms of woe My spirit grew exempt. Sad, gloomy, slow, The forms, of late my fellows, I descried Journeying along those aisles,—deep, lasting throe To inchoate, for sin of suicide,— In clime apportioned to their gloom, or hate, or pride. 36 No words revealed to me the end or cause For which those spirits hither came or went; Nor know I if I knew that region's laws By some strange influences incident Unto its clime; or whether, now unblent With earth's gross mould, deep intuition filled The regal mind,—and thus, plenipotent, She saw and knew. Suffice it, what she willed To know, that knowledge swift throughout her essence thrilled. 37 Conscious of this her high prerogative, The soul for mystic travel girt her thews, Intent on viewing shapes she knew must live In land where penance rebel-thought subdues Of human worms who venture to refuse The gift of life probational, and death Procure by their own hand, daring accuse The Giver, and defying threatened wrath,— Or worn and wearied with the toil of drawing breath. 38 Methought I sped across the gloomy space From whence diverged each subterranean aisle, Thinking the dome vast porch unto some place Of emblemed sovereignty or typic pile Where sceptred suicides in kingly style Might sit, as in some high imperial hall, And there eternity itself beguile With pregnant descant on their earthly fall, On fate, and mortal change, and being spiritual. 39 When lo!—as if these new imaginings Flowed from the soul with architectural power, Or talisman of ancient Magian kings Were there the unbound mind's mysterious dower— Forthwith disclosed, in high investiture Of purple, sceptres, thrones, and diadems, A hall of kings assembled gleamed obscure,— Fair,—and then bright,—until refulgent streams Of splendour issued from their brows begirt with gems. 40 Mingled with these sat ancient forms unnamed Monarchal, but by badge or cognisance Vice-regal known, or whose sage look proclaimed The god-like legislator, or proud glance Betokened bold ambition's heritance On earth of sway despotic. Deeply fraught With wisdom's lessoning the soul her trance Perceived to be,—'mid thrones with sculptures wrought Mythic or parabolic, from earth's legends caught. 41 By beam or rafter architectonic Undarkened,—with a roof of rainbows graced, Smiled that wide palace-hall: yet, upward, quick And timorous looks old shapes columnar cast, That stretched their sinews, as with effort vast, To prop the heavenly arch whose fall they feared. Distorted things—abortions of the Past— They were: Satyrs, with wild-goats' legs and beard, And one-eyed Arimasp and Cyclops, there appeared; 42 Scythians, with heel in front, and toes behind, The Abarimonides, and Blemmyæ, will be recognised by readers acquainted with Pliny's portraits of human monsters. On old Imäus known; and Ethiops dark And headless, wearing mouth and eyes enshrined In their huge breasts; and countless monsters stark And staring, hymned divine by hierarch Of Ganges and old Nile,—with heads, tails, arms, Tusks, horns, confused, of elephant, ape, shark, Serpent, dog, crocodile, or ox: vile swarms Of hideous phantasies, half-sharing human forms. 43 In triple colonnade around the immense Ellipsis of that hall these creatures stood,— Colossal images of ache intense And apprehensive dread; while o'er them bowed The arch that still in jewelled beauty glowed. Such horror, blent with grace, Apollo's priest 'Mid strangling folds of Neptune's serpents showed,— And still doth show—enmarbled, undeceased,— That breathing stone the Past to gem the Future leased. The author, it need scarcely be said, has never seen the Laocoön: but does not the imagination, on the mere receipt of testimony, often conceive as deep a worship of that which is believed to be surpassingly beautiful or perfect as an effort of human skill, as the judgment yields, when directed by actual observation? 44 Area within, enclosed, of amplitude More spacious stretched than wide circumference Of sculptured temple, by far traveller viewed In Hindoo cave, See Captain Seely's enthusiastic description of “Keylas the Proud,” among the caverned temples of Elora.—or where wild audience The Arab gives to hoar Magnificence These and the remaining lines of the stanza form almost a literal embodiment of a picture that I remember to have met with in some volume of Eastern Travels, but I cannot tell where it is to be found. Defying Ruin, and in some huge tomb, Hewed for a monarch, nightly sleeps,—from whence, I' the morn, he blesses Mecca's seer,—while gloom Eterne veils Memnon's brow beholding Thebes' sad doom. 45 Throughout this column-girt enclosure rose Thrones,—some with fashion of a fortalice Or tower; some, like cathedralled shrine where vows Are paid to saintly heritor of bliss, Showed niche, and pinnacle, and quaint device Of carven wonder-work; while some parade Outvied of old renowned Acropolis Or Parthenon, where graceful shaft o'erlaid With bossed entablature Man's noblest skill displayed. 46 Significant depicurings of fraud Conjunct with force,—chimeras blending grim Fierce forms with fascinations,—shapes that awed Pelasgic men in ages old and dim,— For metope, along the frieze' broad rim, 'Tween gem-dropp'd triglyphs, wore each classic throne; Rapine of harpy, smile of siren prim, Lewd lure of lamia, wile of sphinx, and frown Of minotaur and archer-centaur there were shown. 47 Or, where a shrine-shaped throne, o'ercanopied With perforated carvery, rose,—a pile Of frail aërial wonder,—typified Were Fright and Mischief mixt with Stealth and Guile: Hag rode her broomstaff, flankt with bugbear vile And goggle-eyed hobgoblin, while a host Led by Puck-Hairy mocked with infantile And puny trick the snake that wreathed and tossed His trail around the skull and cross-bones of grim ghost. 48 Mute, wonder-stricken, long, methought, I gazed, And, pondering, did my vision's meaning read; Until the tenants of the thrones sense raised Within me of their presence there, flesh-freed. No sage interpreter I seemed to need From whom to learn their names; without a veil Unto the soul, the pride, pain, dread, or deed That rent them from earth's tabernacles frail, Lay opened—by some fiat supernatural.— 49 Silver tiara, decked with amethysts And sapphires, piling gorgeously above His brow,—pearl-studded circlets round his wrists,— Gold sceptre mounted by an emerald dove,— And dazzling gems of myriad hues enwove Throughout his robes wherein the peerless dye Of rarest murex with the ruby strove For richness,—showed that soft Assyrian nigh Who closed his life of lust—a self-incendiary. 50 On either side Sardanapalus sat, On thrones ornate of ivory and gold,— Cloud-wrapt, that gray Cathaian autocrat, With uneuphonic name Chow-Sin, Emperor of China, B.C. 1122—His suicide is related to have resembled that of Sardanapalus. in records old Of Orient writ, who did his life enfold With deathly flames; and that foul glutton, who, As sages tell, his maw's capacious hold To satisfy, worried his spouse, although Full-suppered,—Cambes, lord of Lydia's pampered crew. 51 Next these, three mystic thrones: the Theban chief Who solved the Sphinx's riddle,—son and spouse Of Creon's daughter,—suicide of grief, Horror, and madness, joined: sad Nauplius, The sire of Palamedes, who his house Brought low by guileful Ithacus deplored; And that Athenian exarch, old Ægeus, Who, of his death, fearing his son devoured, Left, in the Hellene island-wave a dim record. 52 Illustrious less by sheen and garniture Of gold and gems, than by his kingly height Colossal, sat the Hebrew, who a cure For fallen fortunes, in his grievous plight, At Endor sought,—but, from the hoary sprite Of Israel's seer no health or help derived. On demi-throne, next, that disastrous wight Who Baasha's son of sovereignty deprived, In Tirzah, and himself a seven days' king survived. Zimri.—His story is narrated in the 16th chapter of the Ist book of Kings. 53 Of Ilion's foes, when stern Pelides fell, The boldest,—but of honour shorn, and driven By pride to madness,—with enduring hell Of hate upon his brow, from earth though riven, Sat Ajax Telamon. A haloed heaven Of splendour dawned where crownless Codrus, throned By frowning Ajax, smiled: his soul's look leaven Of low self-love disdained,—and, still, profound Regard for fatherland seemed in its essence wound. 54 Fraternal spirits,—each with civic palm Invested, sceptreless, o'er deepest thought Brooding of things to come,—Lycurgus, calm And dignified and peaceful, sat, and caught With friendly grasp the hand unto him raught Of brave Charondas: these, enthroned 'mid blaze Of kindred light, looked as they would devote Their souls once more to Hades, if the days Returned when men would die their fellow-man to raise. 55 Traitor to Freedom when the Alban sires Had smitten kings with rout, and made their name A stench,—sat Appius,—he whose lewdling fires The spotless maid had scathed with deathful shame, But that a father's knife preserved her fame,— Giving to deathless life his Virgin child. On more than regal throne, with amorous flame Still glowing in his eyes, next the defiled Decemvir, sat another lust-slave, self-exiled 56 From his old riot-field,—for such he made The earth, that, by strange turns, is cursed with feud And sport of monsters. Neighbour to this shade Of Antony, and chief of Rome's huge brood Of tyrants, sat the matricide whom mood Of insane merriment to minstrelsy Impelled, when, wearied with his game of blood, He loosed the fiends of havoc, that, with glee, Lit up Rome's flames, and howled to swell his jubilee. 57 Th'imperial patriot, Otho, that to save The blood of thousands shed his own, and quenched The rage of war,—but vainly since he gave Earth to a tyrant,—sat next one who drenched The soil less than he willed with gore, nor blenched At broken oaths in age,—Maximian—thrall Of power, though throned. Divided sceptre clenched Bonosus vile, the drunkard,—of whose fall They said his carcase was ‘a jug hung by the wall!’ 58 And other revellers in bloody mirth, Italian, or Byzantine, arrogant And pride-blown, sat, as when the slavish earth They shared; save when on that great combatant Whom Pontic Orient and the rich Levant Owned lord,—proud Mithridates,—timid look They cast: for, as they glanced at him, ascaunt, His eye of fire told how he ill could brook The dwarfs so near;—whereat their fear-smit spirits shook. 59 Neighbouring stood Juba's gold and ivory throne,— The Mauritanian: next, with shorn display, Sat Nicocles, the Paphian—who alone Fled not dishonour when the conquering sway Of Ptolemy fair Cyprus owned: the way He took, his bosom's queen and daughters fair Took also,—and now shared the chastened ray That clad their chief: a group of Love they were, Among fierce shapes of pride that haughtily sat there. 60 Nor was the suicide of softer sex By these shown only. Near the ancient seat Of Œdipus, the mystical reflex Appeared of her who hasted to complete The Fates' decree, when Meleager's feat Was known,—burning the billet she had kept To save the life, that thence, she loathed. A meet Sisterhood, numerous, by Althæa slept Or stonily gazed: eld forms by Mythic names yclept. 61 Radiant in widowed beauty, next to these Sat she who loved her wandering Teucrian guest, And raved to find the faithless one rude seas Had borne away,—till, for her grief-worn breast She sought by her own hand a deathful rest. Near Dido sat that mournful mother-queen, Meek Sisygambis, who fled life distrest By death of Philip's son, still more than teen That she the slaughter of her discrowned son had seen. 62 With ardent glance on her old paramour, The soft Triumvir, bending,—amid waste Of grandeur throned,—outvieing, as of yore, Earth's queens in pride,—earth's harlots in unchaste And wanton thought,—sat she from Greek dynast Of Nile descended, asp-stung heritress Of fame for lavish wealth with lavish haste Consumed upon her beauty's slaves: excess Transcended only by her false heart's fickleness. 63 Apart, in lonely loftiness of soul, Sat Boadicea, simple, unadorned, Yet seeming with stern virtue to control The scoffing spirit which my thought discerned Within a frivolous crowd that there sojourned In visioned queenly state.— But now my trance Teemed with more wonder,—for, enrapt, I learned These spirits' thoughts: no vocal resonance There was: yet soul to soul made mystic utterance.— 64 “Thy prophecy, sage Spartan,”—proudly gibed, Amid his pomp, the Chaldee's glistering shade,— “Thy prophecy—grows old: still monarch-tribed And rainbow-vaulted is this hall: they fade Not yet—these regal splendours! Disarrayed We are, by turns; to periodic pain, On joyless wanderings sent, through bog and glade, O'er crag and rock, or burnt or frore, our stain To purge: yet, in due season, thus restored, we reign! 65 “Errest thou not here, presaging utter change To kingly spirits, as thou erredst in land Of Lacedæmon old, when system strange By thy fantastic brain was hotly planned, To train rude rabble Greeks in self-command, And mould their minds to virtue? Foolish dream Long dissipated! Spartan, thus divanned, Crowned, sceptred, and enthroned, the changeful stream Of ceaseless being shall find our Essences supreme. 66 “Such is my sentence,—from the pregnant past Arguing the future: and in vain they prate Of inborn greatness in all minds amassed Who say,—of Hades this unequal state, And Earth's, shall end by the decree of Fate. Where are the virtues by thy statutes bred? Our Asia's conqu'ring hosts—effeminate Esteemed by the rude sires thy black broth fed— Brandish the scymitar o'er their tame children's head. 67 “There must be conquering lords, and slaves that yield: There have been,—and there will be. Thou may'st stroke Thy beard, grave scorner,—slighting truth revealed By eld experience! Wherefore bear their yoke Earth's mortal millions? Why, in one age shook From their sire's shoulders, do the sons upheave And wear it, in the next? Hath a realm broke Its golden sceptre? 'Twas but to receive A stranger's iron rod,—beneath its bruise to grieve. 68 “Danaian,—Monarchs rule by Nature's law; And all who seek Her statutes to disturb, Teaching kings' solemn titles have foul flaw In reason, and the general mind should curb Their sovereign will, or sweep from earth's wide orb Their honoured name,—know thou, he would uproot All happiness from human hearts, perturb All peace, and fill the world with dissolute And lawless beings tending downwards to the brute. 69 “What mean, I ask thee, these thronged typic forms, These images of allegoric shape? Thou say'st, false-seeing prophet, that dire storms Will burst on Thrones and leave us no escape But yawn of fabled Chaos! Ha! a jape It is—such as thou toldst, in olden time, When Greeks from Delphi thy return, agape, Expected. Spartan, know, a truth sublime These portraitures set forth, in this mysterious clime: 70 “This sky of promise-woof, these shapes of strength, These sceptred pomps and blazonries, combine With this vast palace-hall's imperial length And architectural splendour, by divine Working of Nature, Her superb design To manifest—that She hath firmly set The frame of things—the frame of things benign! Kings reign by Nature's law! I at thy threat Of dissolution laugh! 'Tis like thyself—a cheat! 71 “By hybrid forms, like these, the sage or bard Of old pictured deep thoughts: he, prescient Of mortal things, not dimly Mind's award In after-life foresaw: and thus hath lent Wise Nature, here, familiar emblems, meant To infix our spirits' reverence of Her high Unchangeable decrees. Other intent Wombed in the Soul o' the World, if thou descry, Lacon, these Potencies, with me, thy proof defy!—” 72 He ceased, but the Laconian answered not, Save with a smile; whereat, in subtle guise, The spirit of pale Chow the theme upcaught, Echoing the proud Assyrian's prophecies Of endless royalty.— “To mysterise I scorn,”—he said: “the sage of great Cathay By allegory taught,—the teacher wise Before all mortals; but, now freed from clay, Truth's visage all unveiled Mind may to Mind display. 73 “The sacred sage who aims with sanctions strong Of faith and fear, fable and prodigy, To fence the throne, humanely to prolong Peace, order, seeks: for peace and order flee That state disrupt by anarch Liberty— The wild destructive demon! And when peace And order fade, fades every good: while free Confusion's votaries call a realm, decrease, Therein, all polished forms and winning courtesies: 74 “These constitute the sweets of human life, Rendering its gall less mortal, as renews Our vigour this resplendent vision rife With promise,—this bright pomp that, swift subdues All sense of pain, doubt, fear, which us pursues In mystic seasons when high Powers exact Their penalties,—high Powers unseen that use Their creature Man according to some pact Beyond our scope—but held eternally infract. 75 “To mysterise I scorn—yet own the task Of labouring sages guerdon doth deserve Of thanks from kings: they clothe with prudent mask The image from whose worship Man might swerve If nuded: they contribute to conserve Homage of monarchs, awe of gods, restraint Of wholesome reverence for law; and nerve The arm of Power, when it grows old and faint, And impious men deride its ceremonies quaint. 76 “But I disdain to mysterise: let pass The fables of old bards, and thy far view Truthful experience guiding,—scorning glass Of types and stale conjectures,—Spartan, due Observance take that novelties congrue But ill with social weal: while bloom and thrive, Through endless ages, lands whose tribes eschew Disloyalty,—where sons meek sires survive, Preserving, piously, their customs primitive. 77 “There knowledge grows; hale labour fills the realm With teeming plenty; life doth, vigorous, strike Its roots into the soil; and swarms, that whelm With ruin lands more changeful where dislike To reverend custom lifts the rebel pike Or traitor dagger,—drain deep bog and swamp,— Delve the stiff marl,—yea, on the bald cliff, like The eagle nestle,—strewing mould, with tramp Industrious, on the rock; their zeal what toil can damp? 78 “There arts that rise in the far mist of ages Are cherished and preserved with sacred care; And, if aught nobler lore of later sages Evolves, no sacrilegious hands uptear The roots of ancient wisdom,—but, by rare And tender husbandry, the late-found flower Is with the old engraffed,—and, thenceforth, bear Their wedded branches fruits that richer shower Wide o'er the blest peace-nurtured land their bounteous dower. 79 “Proud Greek, I ask thee, where is now the boast Of gay and changeful Hellas?—Where the pride Of wisdom, valour, song,—your wave-washed coast, Ye said, would wear for aye? Doth it abide Where sage Minerva's owl still sits to chide Old Echo, when some lingering column falls On grey Athena's waste, at eventide? Or glows it from the brows of Theban thralls And Spartan cowards—a barbarian's frown appals? 80 “Graian, behold, from China's terraced mountains, Meek, peaceful myriads to the valleys wend, And with their brethren by the silver fountains Reclining, to some hoary teacher lend Enraptured audience,—while his lips commend The lessons of the ever-honoured seer Whose wisdom's lustre doth as far transcend The glimmering lights your westerlings revere, As doth the orient sun outvie each smaller sphere. 81 “Behold the greatness of the Flowery Nation Attracting wondering eyes from all the earth, While countless tongues rehearse loud commendation Of vast Cathay: how science had her birth, In peaceful secret, there; and glided forth From her pure cradle, like a godlike thing, Blessing unboastfully!—pouring her worth Of wisdom on the world; but of her spring Primeval to the infant isles ne'er whispering. 82 “Behold how earth's united sages crowd To pay their homage at the shrine maternal To which old Northmen wild the mute guide owed That led them o'er the deeps where regions vernal Breathed their rich balm, when light of stars supernal Was hid—the mystic needle—to the pole Leal ever, as, to Wisdom's truths eternal, By sage Confucius opened, ages roll And still find China's children cleaving with one soul. 83 “Or art, held magic once, that spreads the glory Of thought with speed,—by which the peasant hind, Familiar as the prince, talks with bard hoary Whose bones are wind-spread atoms, but whose mind Still lives, converses, fulmines, splendour-shrined Upon the lettered page; while pyramid And column, arch and dome, taunt human kind With ruin, where the founders' names are hid,— And dust becomes of Death a mirror pellucid. 84 “Or delicatest skill, by which the worm Yields up the riches of her soft cocoon Where bounteous nature teacheth her to form For royalty and beauty,—lustrous boon!— The fabric for their robes, or proud festoon That decks their palaces: or various art Pictorial, that—by tapestry, cartoon, Canvass, or marble, where dead forms upstart To life—sublime instruction doth to man impart. 85 “All the wide world inherits of the wealth Of wisdom, genius, skill, attribute now, The truly wise unto those steps of stealth With which the Genius of the land of Foh Clomb Himaleh's tall barriers of snow To kindle light celestial on the strand Of infant India,—whence, as sages show, The Chaldee, Mitzraim, and thy later land, Achaian, lit their lamps with an ungenerous hand. 86 “The borrowed lights are quenched: the parent flame Glows with undimmed and steady lustre, still! Babel and Thebes, and Athens, have a name With things that were; or claim from infantile Far-islet harps and voices strains that chill With sense of desolation them that waken Their deathful echoes: Life and vigour fill Ancestral Cambalu, —whose strength unshaken By China's thousand pristine cities is partaken. 87 “Spartan, I challenge thee upon this theme, Disdaining mystery. Obedience meek To the high wearer of the diadem Sways the vast heart of China: fathers seek Like reverence from their sons; and children speak A filial language, through the land, unknown To kingless libertines. The fruit unique Of natural monarchy, through ages shown,— Peace, shedding gladness, on my fatherland hath grown. 88 “And why we thus hold thrones doth thence result, I judge, that great maternal Nature keeps Her purposes: here, witness we the adult Expressions of Her will: on earth She heaps Kindly monitions that Man's welfare reaps Its thrift from kings: now, after-life doth prove Her unity of wisdom; —and, while sweeps Duration on, in kingly souls enwove Shall grow intenser consciousness of Nature's love.—” 89 Thus spake the old Cathaian shade, and ceased; While sceptred spirits, in refulgent rays, Each, from his essence, sent forth bright attest Of grateful joy. Such quintessential praise These render; but a gathering gloom betrays Some scorner seated 'mid the effluence bright Of gladdened mind. Surceased the mystic blaze, And uprose Antony, with careless spite Uttering these thoughts of barbëd truth and scornfu slight:— 90 “That regal souls shall regally possess This heritage, nor presaged ruin hurl These powers to nought, needs not thy wilderness Of proof, dim Shade! When penal tempests curl Round us their waves we sink not in their whirl; But thus retrieve our thrones. Why seek we more? Let those that prophesy the prince and churl, New equals, shall on this mysterious shore Exist, shew whence derived their visionary lore. 91 “Till then, I scorn their threats, as now I scorn, Cathaian fabler, what thou dost miscount Of undisturbed regalities age-worn. I tell thee, cloud-clad king, souls paramount Become by Fate: Nature in her great fount Moulds monarchs, who earth's sceptres seize, and thrust Old palsied cumber-thrones aside, to mount, Themselves, the seat of sway; ay, with robust Hand, pile crown upon crown on their own brows august. 92 “These are her darlings, though a coarse-fed serf Bring forth their clay, and ignorantly hush Within his mud-built shed the cradled dwarf At whose full voice the bright-armed throng shall rush To conquest, and whose hand, time-nerved, shall crush Old pomps like rotten reeds. These Nature rears In native loftiness; old monarchs blush When they behold them, or wax wan with fears; For on their ominous front, deep-graved, stern change appears. 93 “Stern change—but needful: for, thou dost indulge Earth's partial love, Cathaian picturer, Denying that great Nature's laws promulge The healthfulness of change. Light task it were To dash thy brittle images, and blurr Their tricksy tints to gangrened, livid hues; To show how Misery finds no comforter Throughout thy fatherland; how Want subdues All virtue in its monster cities' dark purlieus; 94 “To point thee to the life its millions drag,— Its famine-stricken millions,—eager, glad, To find a putrid dog for food, or rag To hide their nakedness: gaunt man driven mad By hunger and oppression, to these sad And dreary shades fleeing for refuge from His hell on earth: pale woman, loath to add More wretched things to Life's slow martyrdom, Strangling, remorselessly, the fruit of her own womb! 95 “Light task it were, gray fabler, to lift up The silken curtain thou hast, sleekly, cast O'er the huge tombs of city life where droop, In squalor, human shapes become repast For vermin ere they die: from whom, aghast, Thy mandarins, of boasted courtesy, Would turn and shriek, as if the black plague's blast Had blown on them. I scorn to answer thee At large,—threading thy labyrinthine eulogy,— 96 “Or, I would utter all the horrid tale Of infant murder, starving toil, accurst Desire for gold, devices of the pale And cunning bonze, conceit of idiots nursed In ignorance, crime and folly that will burst Upon the world, and tell its own strange story, Ere long. To regal spirits what rehearsed Thou hast—let this suffice:—for, now, the glory Of thy dim land, like other dreams, grows transitory. 97 “The restless pirates of the northern isles,— Breaking your barriers of three thousand years,— With their own eyes, your land of fabled smiles Behold, and find it but a land of tears— Like to their own. While woman's form appears Bowed with her infant on her back, in mud To the waist, to till the rice-plant toiling,—cheers, Though savagely, this thought their frozen blood— That equal degradation hath, but yet subdued 98 “One of their sea-girt homes—Hibernia:—there, Gray dynast,—if with disembodied mind, Throughout these shades, thou dost deep descant share,— Like squalid want and suffering, intertwined With life of crowds, that labour, thou wilt find— And only there! Oh, that old Rome could wake, Once more, her victor eagles, and unbind These slaves from their vile fetters,—or earth shake With change until they could, themselves, their bondage break! 99 “Thou fabling phantasm, what hath man become, Sunk in the stagnancies of custom old?— A creature who will whine to win the crumb His tyrant's dog refuses! If the bold Democraty of buried Rome, controlled, Ev'n by earth's masters, but with dole of bread Dealt to them daily, could such slaves behold— Such breadless slaves—o'er earth's old region tread, Their fleshless shades would frown among the doomed dead! 100 “Justly thou art rebuked: yet, controvert I not thy sentence, that with regal state Dynamic essences shall be begirt Through ceaseless life: I only deprecate Thy errors: claiming for the child of Fate— The natural heir of greatness—that award His deeds deserve. Monarchs, we create Anew, your strength! Not fabling sage or bard,— But we—Fate's darlings—merit grateful kings' regard!”— 101 Thus ended, like an actor for applause, He who a haughty challenger began,— Winning no meed of praise where all grew foes, Stung by his scorn, or scorning, while, with scan Intense, they saw his vanity outran Truth's soberness. He sank with humbled crest— Perceiving frowns sit on each ghostly van Of those throned powers. Forthwith made manifest His mental throes Nero's proud spirit of unrest.— 102 “That Thrones to thy stout valour owe huge debt,”— He spake, casting around a withering smile;— “Is true as that thou wert an anchoret. Hero of Actium!—Vestal of the Nile!— No time, on earth, your effigies shall spoil Of lasting laurels,—wreath so fitly blending With Daphne's virtue valour without soil! In Hades, triumphs, coy loves never ending Shall still be yours,—the future the bright past transcending! 103 “Darling of Fate!—to swell thy self-sung laud Let spirits vie! let grateful kings bow down And homage thee,—by loud trump overawed Of thy great glory, which thyself hast blown! Vauntful buffoon,—that thou dost fill a throne In this mysterious clime, adds to the scourge Of princely spirits: mockeries, I this crown And sceptre must pronounce,—whate'er some urge Of ceaseless pomp,—if shapes like thine these visions forge. 104 “What wert thou but an upstart and an ape Of spirits truly regal who thy freak Of kingship suffered, till maturer shape Their own great plans of sovereignty could take? Fawning on Julius, who beneath thy sleek Exterior saw and mocked the thriftless flame For empire,—or, on young Octavius meek And crafty, hurling sneers,—thy petty game Subserved the master-spirits of the Roman drame. 105 “And when thou hadst subserved their astute end Thou wast laid by. Boaster,—'tis not the fool Who blabs his aims, and thinks each man a friend, Whom Nature marks for empire; but a tool She shaped him; and, to spirits born for rule He hath his use,—to Fate's true darlings, skilled To hide their reach with feigned indifference cool, Or virtuous humbleness, and ever filled, With wary watch of all by whose lent thews they build. 106 “Our Roman greatness by such masonry Of mind was raised, until the Julian boy Laid on the top-stone with felicity Of skill: for aye of power appearing coy, Continuing antique symbols to employ,— Titles and forms of the old commonwealth,— Hallowing the shade securely to destroy The substance of licentiousness: wise stealth, By which the pulse of sovereignty gained vigorous health. 107 “With ‘bread and theatres’ the vulgar gasp Was wisely fed, when Wisdom thus had won The earth's rich rule: to our illustrious grasp The reigns of empire were bequeathed,—our own By right of power, craft, favour: handed down Entire by us,—the pusillanimous brood Of later days reared a divided throne And lost the heritage whose amplitude Comprised the general world's wealth, wisdom, hardihood. 108 “Not more I mock when cloud-wrapt shadows doat, And fondly prate of barbarous unknown shores, Than I despise ye,—sceptrelings distraught With pride,—souls of empireless emperors,— That round me sit! How rich a dower was yours! By how much toil of sinew and of mind Collected, conglobated, were Earth's stores Treasured in Rome,—the Eternal!—throne assigned By Nature and the Gods, for sway of human kind! 109 “Never shall men, again, view aught august And glorious as Rome—that mighty heart O' the world whose pulses fed with life robust By million health-fraught veins, mingling athwart Her giant trunk, did duly re-impart Vigour and strength to every distant limb! How gazeth, even now, the Afric swart, Fierce frozen Kelt, Teuton, or Tartar grim, Untombing some huge vertebra or relic dim 110 “Of Rome's vast skeleton,—a monstrous bulk O'er isles and continents that lies, supine,— Wondering what giant soul the mighty hulk Served, in far unknown age, for earthen shrine! Dwarfed, dastard heirs to Cæsar's lofty line,— If courage to defend what they bequeathed,— If soul to comprehend their grand design,— They could on your weak essences have breathed,— Rome's life with glory had been perdurably wreathed! 111 “Inferior natures,—your effeminate gripe Of the world's sceptre was dissolved like dew Upon the grass what time the sun doth wipe Up night's few lingering tears: so feeble grew Your grasp of power the Roman world scarce knew Ye had a throne, at last,—for ye had ceased To be its masters long before it threw Your filmy fetters off to don the vest Of vassalage unto the smooth, tiaraed priest. 112 “Ye despicable things, that sit and swell Yourselves in empty pomp—ye that betrayed Rome's glory to the Goth—” “Vile spirit, quell The tempest of thy madness!”—spake the shade Of fierce Maximian:—“Whom dost thou upbraid, Coward, with timorousness?—monster, with vice And idle dissoluteness?—Of all who swayed Earth's sceptres, thou unworthiest shar'st this bliss, These shadowed thrones in spiritual necropolis! 113 “Slanderer,—remember that Maximian strove To prop the falling state,—nor age his hands Unsinewed for the sword; but round him wove Their fatal net domestic traitor bands. That one, stern Truth with foulest vices brands, Doth play the chidester, here,—one, who should hide His head in shame, uncensured reprimands Thrones who excel in virtue,—doth betide, I fear, our essence still to weakness misallied. 114 “Thrones of the West,—why sit ye tamely, thus, Bearing reproach from a vile miscreant Whose name doth blot Rome's annals?”— Nebulous With thought grew, now, the spirits arrogant On neighbouring thrones, seeming with wrath to pant And throb, as throbs the thunder cloud: their rage Soon burst in tumult: Nero, scornful taunt Renewed; and Rome's whole self-slain lineage Seemed on each other clamorous, ireful war to wage.— 115 As, when upon a seat of gamesome hares, Or brood of quarrellous birds, the soaring kite Stoops suddenly, victor with vanquished shares Silent and swift retreat,—so shrunk with fright To ignominious dumbness each fierce sprite Of haughty Rome—shrunk, like a coward thing— When rose, with front of intellectual might The regal Mithridates. Thus, to bring Thought to Power's rescue, strove the strong-souled Pontic king: 116 “I marvel not,—illustrious Spartan ghost,— That thou, with keen sagacity, dost leave Rome's mimic gladiators to be tossed With rage of earth's old pride, which still doth cleave To these thin vehicles, and, perhaps, will grieve And vex our fleshless essences for aye: I marvel not, that, scorning to achieve A worthless conquest, to commutual fray Thou leavest thy foes:—let Folly kindred Folly slay! 117 “Let Rome's throned pigmies argue, answerless! A brood on whom I grudgingly bestow A frown, recalling Sylla's dreadlessness, Gorgeous Lucullus, and the godlike brow Of Pompey,—minds, that, each, to have for foe, Ennobled strife more than the glittering stake Of Asia's sceptres, and magnific show Of twenty realms in arms—of whom none spake A tongue their chief unknew, nor burned his yoke to break. 118 “But, while ignoble combat of the soul Thou nobly scornst,—I marvel, Graian wise, That, here, in Hades, thou dost seek control O'er mightier essences, by worn-out guides Of mystery. Not to antagonise Thy spirit I seek,—but challenge pertinent And weighty cause for startling prophecies Of dissolution. How to thee hath lent Unerring Nature Her divine premonishment? 119 “Since, in this after-life, no more by dull Deceptive sense, from sound, sight, touch, doth earn The labouring soul her knowledge; and though full Of images our being, since all intern They germ, and, from our working thought yborn, Take spiritual embodiment; since live These shapes by plastic throes with which we yearn Essentially, and Essence can derive No unknown truth from the mere representative 120 “Of its own ever-active energy; Since all we view, or seem to view, in space Irradiate, thus, with emblemed royalty, Is reflex of ourselves, and we erase These splendours when, by Nature's law, to trace Again our steps o'er penal wilds we range,— Or seem to range,—and with refulgent grace Resume these thrones, in season due; since change Of bliss, or woe,—by law inexplicably strange,— 121 “Results from our own intellectual force;— What warrants thee predicting force shall whelm Our regal state with ruin, in the course Of spiritual duration, and disrealm Hades of kings, humble the trophied helm Of all her myriad heroes, and exalt The serfs of her mysterious penal realm To equal state, never to know default Or end, beneath the glory of this gem-prankt vault? 122 “What canst thou know,—though intellection deep Be thine,—that we know not? Thou sharest our pain, When pain returns. If o'er thy essence sweep Like woes with ours, how doth to thee pertain Superior potency? Lacon, explain Thy bold vaticinations,—or, henceforth, Expect from kingly spirits haught disdain And dumb contempt, or tempest of their mirth, When to more dark-wombed wonders thou givest dreaming birth!”— 123 So spake the soul of Mithridates, while Awe or approving silence held the Thrones Who in that mystic clime of self-exile Kept disembodied pomp of glistering crowns And lustrous sceptres. Veiled with gloom of frowns, Or lit with eagerness, each visage seemed, Now, on the Spartan fixt. Soft spirit-tones Of suasiveness, soon, from his essence streamed; And thus, of past and future life, he calmly themed: 124 “Spirits of Men, with reverence whom I hail And with fraternal love—albeit I deem These sculptured blazonries a vision frail,— Or, like their antitypes on earth, a dream,— For that your high Humanity supreme, I judge, o'er names and empty pomps;—forbear To count me fabling fantast,—and beteem Me, shunning mortal passion, to declare My thought, by spiritual tongue auxiliar. 125 “Contest I court not,—nor to wrathful strife Seek to impel ye by defiance brave: Brothers, I wot, that earth's poor troublous life Had storms enow: rude storms that hither drave More than a moiety of ye that rave Upon these thrones, contending as if wrath Were reason. Sages say, on earth, the grave Ends passion's turmoil, and the spirit hath, At death, 'mid shapes all passionless, its gentle path. 126 “How little truth they knew!—how much affirmed From love, hope, fear! How little know we still! How oft, when pleasing shapes from thought have germed Within us, have we strengthened them with will That they should live; until they seemed to fill Our utmost life!—Yet, were they things of nought: Soul-mists from essence streaming, volatile, In Hades,—as on earth, ethereal, float, From perfume and putrescence, vapours picture-fraught. 127 “Perchance thou judgest well,—sage Pontic shade,— Attributing this typic statue-crowd, And this enthroned and diademmed parade, To demiurgic power with which doth brood The soul on space, verisimilitude Of what it loves and wishes swift creating:— Yet, if these shapes with substance unendowed Thou deemst,—their life, like ours, from change still dating, I argue, from past change, more change our state awaiting. 128 “I seek no vulnerable thought to pounce Upon—thy metaphysic argument To frustrate; nor will, rashly, aught pronounce Of this strange after-life. 'Twere insolent To dogmatize where being still is blent With mystery. Therefore, when I say, I opine Thou err'st, my spirit tells with diffident Emotion that to other close than thine Her slow deductions lead—pondering on this design: 129 “Pledge of their perpetuity, or proof That kings derive from Nature,—in these shapes, Monstrous and fear-fraught, that to prop this roof Preposterously essay,—if any, escapes My dull perception. Wondrous were collapse Of heaven's own bow!—more wondrous if its fall Could crush an insect! Falsely thus bedrapes Nature's fair face, with fancies that appal, He who mankind would for his selfish ends enthral. 130 “The Power that forms, supports, and governs Man, Smiles on him evermore; benignly woke His infancy with love: unfolds the plan Of happiness in the fair-written book Of Man's own nature, and the forms that look Upon his essence from the outward world; Implants no instinct in his breast to mock His life; but hath his sentient clay impearled With reason—sovereign gem in fragile folds enfurled. 131 ‘A thing of beauty, though but frail, in joy Perpetual might his mortal life be passed; But fablers do his peace and bliss destroy With falsest fears: each hour is overcast With gloom: at death he shrinks; yea, grows aghast At thought of the dread future, which, to shun, He must propitiate mystic demons vast, By rites that serve to load with pious boon The smooth and crafty priest who consecrates the throne. 132 “Ye frown,—shadows of monarchs,—and deport Yourselves full fiercely: yet, with mental eye This vision scan,—and, that its forms conscrt With truths I have proclaimed, and typify Force joined with Fraud, ye, also, will descry. Do not your spirits bear me witness strong That they the real monsters are who try To fill man with belief that they prolong His respite from some monstrous vengeance o'er him hung? 133 “Whether I read these images aright Or err, for high Humanity I claim Precedence of all pomps. Spirits, if true might Or wisdom are inherent in the name Monarchal,—if the sceptre doth inflame The soul of him who sways it with the thirst For virtue,—if Time doth not count with shame Its regal dolts and cowards, nor is curst With vice of monster kings,—I have their names aspersed. 134 “Let your own argument,—your sage debate,— Confute me, when, in sorrowing ire, I say— Your race, in every clime, doth merit hate And vengeance from mankind—the trembling prey Ye ever tortured ere ye deigned to slay! But I renew not strife: spirits, I glow With nobler aim—aside to see ye lay These vanities, scorning the gaudy show That emblems freedom's, virtue's, wisdom's direst foe: 135 “For such is kingship propped by altar—craft: But I renew not strife: spirits, I stand Self-sentenced, self-condemned, since to engraft Mystery with Truth, in my loved fatherland, I sought,—judging mankind might be trepanned To reverence Freedom when her virgin face, Enmasked with sanctity, looked grave and grand: Unskilled to know that her own native grace, Alone, could charm men, lastingly, to her embrace. 136 “Ye style me Prophet! I accept the jest For earnest; and, with mystic wreath thus crowned By your united voice, Mystery attest To be the tyrant Power from whose profound Soul-bondage man is breaking: whispering sound Of Truth's young breath greets Europe's grateful ear; And Freedom, in some hearts, a throne hath found On that new shore where still, alas! appear Earth's olden stains: the helot's stripes, the helot's tear! 137 “Afric's dark tribes, and Asia's populous swarms, The voice of Truth, and Freedom's holy call Shall know, ere long—upstarting,—not to arms, For blood and slaughter; but to disenthral Their new-born spirits from funereal And priest-forged fears; to shake their ancient slough Of sottish ignorance off; no more to crawl In abjectness 'fore hideous gods; nor throw Their slavish frames 'fore kings, in vile prostration low. 138 “Spirits, to tell of wondrous sympathy Subsisting still,—despite our severance From earth,—between flesh-clothed Humanity And unclothed Mind, were futile occupance Of torture's lapse,—which now doth swift advance, As ye perceive, once more, unto its bourne. Albeit uncomprehended, consonance Of Mind's progression in this strange sojourn Subsists, ye know, with minds of men on earth that mourn. 139 “That essences shall glad deliverance reach, In penal clime of suicide, our hope, Unquenchable by torment, seems to teach; And spirits who in Hades never droop With Earth's old doubts, gathered in eloquent groupe, Deep descant hold of glorious state to come For men and spirits,—mystic horoscope Interpreting—that, on both sides the tomb, Men's weary souls, in unison, shall reach blest doom. 140 “And Minds presaging this deliverance blest For fleshless Essences, joy for Earth's teen, Truth for its error, from its slave-toil rest,— Foreshew that love fraternal shall with sheen Genial and mild dissolve the marble mien Of selfishness to soft beneficence; Until, as yearned the godlike Nazarene, It yearns o'er pain and woe, with affluence Of healing help and soul-restoring condolence. 141 “Nor less presage they that the trodden crowd, Long left to grovel in degrading mire Of bruted life, and sunk in desuetude Of reason's energy, her living fire Shall feel anew, and nobly thence aspire To feed the mind with knowledge till its thews Acquiring might, they reassert their higher Gradation spiritual. Such hope diffuse Far-reaching spirits,—hope that even despair subdues. 142 “Thrones,—ye perceive your splendours 'gin to pale; And soon we must our penal throes renew. I cease my theme; and may have erred,—for frail Is still our wisdom: it may be, the Few Shall still the Many trample and subdue: That Truth and Liberty shall bloom—to die, Like glorious winged things, that, swift, pursue The sunbeam-atoms for a day, then hie To death: blending, as 'twere, a breath—a smile—a sigh! 143 “It may be that the human soul is mixt With nature of decadence and frail change, Essentially: that never stably fixt, But mutable, eternally to range From ignorance to wisdom,—then, by strange Return to ignorance,—may be its fate, Inevitably: that when their brief revenge Slaves take on tyrants, they emancipate Themselves in vain, and Nature doth their strife frustrate: 144 “Spirits, it may be emptier than a dream That fair Equality shall one day hold Sole sceptre on the earth: that man shall deem His brother man too sacred to be sold Or slain,—to be by any power controlled, Save the soft force of love and wisdom: field It is for thought: thy dogma,—monarch old,— ‘There must be conqu'ring lords and slaves that yield’— The Future may attest as the stained Past hath sealed. 145 “These splendours pale! Spirits, with me combine Your sentence—that to this deep argument Large aidant minds who tenant this confine Be summoned, when our penance-term is spent, And o'er us this gemmed roof, once more, is bent. New lights on truth may issue from their rays Of cogitation; and some joint consent Accrue to spirits from the confluent blaze Of Essences, when each his glowing thought displays.”— 146 Lycurgus ceased: the columned monster shapes Wox dim to faintness; and a hue of dread Fell on each spirit, knowing torture's lapse Was ended. Ere their sceptred glory fled, Methought, a dying beam of radiance shed From each fast-fading visage did betoken Mute acquiescence in their judgment bred With fair proposal by the Spartan spoken— And, as that dying beam was shed—my dream was broken. BOOK THE SECOND. 1 Lyre of my fatherland! anew, to wake Thy solemn shell, I come, with trembling hand, Feeling my rudeness doth harsh discord make With strings great minstrels all-divinely spanned. How shall a thrall essay to join your band, Ye free-born spirits whose bold music fired My free-born sires to draw the glittering brand For home and England, or, in arms attired, To awe their lion kings who to sole power aspired? 2 How shall a thrall, from humble labour sprung, Successful, strike the lyre in scornful age, When full-voiced bards have each neglected sung, When loftiest rhyme is deemed a worthless page, And Taste doth browse on bestial pasturage? Gray Prudence saith the world will disregard My harping rude, or term it sacrilege That captive leveller hath rashly dared To touch the sacred function of the tuneful bard. 3 Ah! when hath joined the servile world to say Truth's song was fitly-chosen, fitly-timed? The bard fit songster for a lofty lay, Or, that he worthily for bays had climbed? Great spirits! who, from mortal clay sublimed, Securely wear your immortality,— By impulse incontrollable ye hymned Soul-worship of the Beautiful,—the Free, By freeborn strains, aroused to spurn at Tyranny! 4 Thou wert no beggar for permissive grace, Illustrious sire, so blythely debonair, Who didst from Monkery's mis-shapen face The mask of purity, indignant, tear, And its deep-grained licentiousness lay bare, What time our simple fathers thou didst sing On merry journey bent to patter prayer At Martyr-shrine, where bowed the priest-scourged king— That saint with tameless English heart low-homaging! 5 And if thou soughtst thou didst no favour gain Worthy to be esteemed a guerdon meet For one who did in such instructive strain As thine, great chief of Allegory! greet A queenly ear, with rhyme of knightly feat And dark enchantment,—weaving moral pure So deftly with harmonious numbers sweet That, while thou didst the outward sense allure, Thou feddst the mind and heart with Virtue's nouriture. 6 O matchless Archimage of nature, whom I name with awe,—when thou aloft didst hold Thy living ‘mirror’ to strike mortals dumb With vision of its wonders manifold,— To render uglier still the ugly mould Of baneful vice, and gibbet to mankind Their general villainy,—didst thou, for gold, Or great ones' smiles, forbear to tell thy mind, Or shape thy glass like one to their foul vices blind? 7 Or thou, immortal Childe, with him that saw Islam's Revolt, in rapt prohpetic trance,— Did fear of harsh reception overawe Your fervid souls from fervid utterance Of Freedom's fearless shout?—your scathing glance On priestly rottenness, did ye tame down Till priests could brook that lightning's mitigance? Knowing your cold award would be the frown Of Power and Priestcraft,—ye your sternest thoughts made known. 8 And what if all were helot-thoughted things Old Hellene bards to meet by sacred fount Would scorn, save thee, to whom my spirit clings With worship true,—it were enough to count Thy life of toil example paramount To coward precept. ‘Evil days’ were thine, And ‘evil tongues’ and ‘dangers,’ “Paradise Lost.”—yet confront The storm thou didst with courage all-divine, And reared thy stately fabric 'spite of cloud malign! 9 Bard of the mighty harp, whose golden chords, Strung by the Eternal, no befitting theme Found among mortals and their low records, But pealed high anthems to the throne supreme, Or, thundering, echoed where the lurid gleam Of Erebus, revealed the primal fall!— Since thou 'mid ‘darkness’ lone couldst joy, I'll deem This grated cell no dungeon of a thrall, But banquet-chamber where the Mind holds festival! 10 Great minstrel, let the night entomb the day, Let bolts and bars, in mockery, last till doom, So that heaven-robed, thou walkst with me, thy lay Shall dissipate all thought of prison-gloom. Transcendant spirit,—in this narrow room Oft tenanted by woe-worn, bruted child Of man, crushed from his cradle to the tomb By tyrants,—how hast thou my nights beguiled! ‘Smoothing the raven down of Darkness till it smiled’ “Comus.” 11 I joy that my young heart a covenant made— To take thee for its guide in patriot deed, If Life's eventful roll should shew arrayed The brethren of my fatherland agreed To claim their ancient birthright, and be freed. Oh how the lesson of thy deathless toil, While my soul homaged thee, in me did feed The flame of freedom! Shall the sacred oil Not keep it quenchless till the grave its foemen foil? 12 Be thou enthroned, bright patriot, tuneful seer, Not on a regal seat that thou wouldst scorn As loftily as e'er thou scornedst here The thrones of kings, or baubles by them worn; But, be thy name on England's bosom borne In pride, while all her sons thy lineage boast!— Thy awful brow is shaded! Dost thou mourn And bode thy darling Commonweal is lost?— Nay!—but we'll win her back, by Labour's gathered host! 13 She shall return, with face more heavenly fair, And graced with limbs of fitlier symmetry! Ay,—shall return!—for we thy kindred are: We'll win thy ‘mountain nymph, sweet Liberty!’ “L'Allegro. ” Thou, and the glorious phalanx of the free,— Hampden, and Pym, and Eliot, Selden, Vane, Marten, and martyred Sydney,—what were ye? Our elder brethren!—and the kingly chain Ye loosed—we'll break: our kingless birthright we'll regain! 14 Honour—all honour to thee, patriot bard!— With whom I took sweet counsel in my youth: I joy, that though my lowly lot was hard, My spirit, raised by thine, forgot its ruth, And, smiling, dared the dint of Want's fell tooth: I joy, that all enamoured of thy song, While simpletons esteemed my ways uncouth, I wandered, by day's dawn, the woods among, Or did, with midnight lamp, my grateful task prolong. 15 Poet of Paradise, whose glory illumed My path of youthful penury, till grew The desart to a garden, and Life bloomed With hope and joy, 'midst suffering,—honour due I cannot render thee; but reverence true This heart shall give thee, till it reach the verge Where human splendours lose their lustrous hue; And when, in death, my mortal joys all merge— Thy grand and gorgeous music, Milton, be my dirge!— 16 Long had the night o'erveiled the summer sky, And, through the grated casement of my lair,— Was it some guardian spirit's wakeful eye The captive keeping?—one mild, silver star, Benignant, beamed. Meanwhile, of angel war, Fierce waged in heaven against the Eternal king,— Of great Messiah, in his cherub car, Routing the foe,—I heard the minstrel sing,— In plain prose, I mean that my rehearsal of Milton, during the long hours of darkness in my sleeping cell, frequently converted the gloom into a season of ecstasy. I had committed three books of “Para- dise Lost” to memory, while at the last twenty years before my imprisonment; and I thus was enabled to realise the high value of such an inalienable possession. And heaven's magnific vault with clash of conflict ring! 17 Then, in ecstatic whispers, of the love And joy, and peace, and harmony, that reign Unceasing, 'mid the radiant choir above, Now war is o'er,—he sang: anon, in strain Sonorous chaunted how, on burning plain Rallied the fallen warriors' myriad host, And hurled defiance, 'spite of fiery pain And torment, at the Conqueror,—their vain boast Of strength original maintaining—although lost! 18 The mighty stature, and still mightier pride And energy of him who ‘seemed alone ‘Th' antagonist of heaven’ “Paradise Lost.”—in gloom descried Breasting the flaming waves, or, on the throne Of stately Pandemonium regal grown, And confident in ruin,—the high seer, Filled with his theme, in deep unearthly tone Rehearsed,—while I, entranced with pleasing fear, Imagined I beheld the proud archangel near!— 19 Thus night sped on until the golden lyre And song magnificent brought sense of rest, As late they woke the spirit's sleepless fire: So breathe, conjunctive, at Her high behest, Nature's great servitors, to make Man blest— Maugre his foes!—the Muse and Phantasy, Hope, Music, Sleep: until into his nest— Straw on an iron slab—he sinks with glee— Even where the lordlings trow he pines in misery! 20 Nor did my minstrel guest upon me look Farewell—until the soul her mystic flight,— Leaving the flesh to slumber,—once more took: When, o'er Death's sea, by supernatural might Upborne, we seemed to speed, and then to alight Together on that ‘boundless continent ‘Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night, ‘Starless exposed’ “Paradise Lost.”—where wandered souls that rent Themselves, unbidden, from their earthly tenement. 21 Familiar seemed that drear and gloomy land Unto the stately Shade with whom I trod The swamp and rock o'er which the ghastly band Essayed their march. But, now, as if some god Potential had transfixed them by his nod, The chasms forgot to yawn, the rocks to roll And threaten, warlike meteors to forebode, And spectres ceased their gibings fierce and foul: Horror was hushed, and, patient, owned the bard's control. 22 Swiftly we threaded through the caverned aisle Of wondrous masonry; and, forthwith, passed Thorough the vault that seemed sepulchral pile Scooped from primeval rock. Then with light haste Upborne again, as if on gentle blast Pillowed, or winged away by flying steed Invisible, we neared a mountain vast, Where toiled a troop thinking its height would lead Up to some happier clime from pains of penance freed. 23 Aloft we floated, passing crowd on crowd, Their guises varied as the flowers a-field, While with all nameless hues their features glowed, Betokening them self-exiles, unannealed, From every mortal clime. Still up we wheeled Our flight, reaching no summit,—countless souls Hard toiling upwards being still revealed, As if the discontented in huge shoals Had hither 'scaped from Earth's old hated prison-walls! 24 Our flying travel ended where a grove Grew on the mount. 'Midst, sat a form which seemed With raised right hand to mock the pomp of Jove Hurling his lightnings. Asking, as I dreamed, Who this might be—'twas ‘he who to be deemed ‘A god leapt fondly into Etna flames— ‘Empedocles’ “Paradise Lost.”—the bard replied; while gleamed From the throned figure looks of one who aims Unto some high pretension to assert his claims. 25 Methought, on this aspiring form I gazed Until a youth, who downcast looked, and coy, Came near; when wondering that he never raised His eyes, I asked what thoughts him might employ: The minstrel said, 'twas ‘he who to enjoy ‘Plato's Elysium leapt into the sea— ‘Cleombrotus’ “Paradise Lost.”—and, the fanatic boy Thus briefly named, my minstrel guide from me Departed. I, to follow felt I was not free. 26 Perplexed, I seemed awhile to look around, And wistfully to think of mother Earth; But soon all thought and consciousness were bound Unto that mountain region: I felt dearth Of earthly sense, as heretofore, but birth Of intellection; for the spirits twain, Of Hellas sprung, seemed now, in words of worth, Though without mortal sound, of their soul's stain And essences of things, to speak in fervid strain.— 27 “Sage Agrigentine, shall we never leave Our earth-born weaknesses?”—the youth began: “Ages of thought, since Hades did receive Our spirits, have elapsed, by mortal span,— Still, from the great disciplinarian Stern Truth, we slowly learn! A juggler's dupe Thou art, ev'n now—thyself the charlatan! Nay!—like an intellectual eagle, stoop Upon thy quarry, Self-Deceit, with conquering swoop! 28 “Vainly, thou knowst, thou wilt seek worshippers Of thy proud foolery, here. Before thee fall No votaries; and thy erring spirit stirs, In vain, her sovereignty to re-enthral By harbouring old thoughts terrestrial: None will thy godship own! Thy rock descend, Laying stale follies by, and let us call Forth from the mind the vigorous powers that rend Fate's curtain; and our ken beyond these shades extend!”— 29 The younger Hellene ceased; and, while he spake, The elder changed, like one who having quaffed The maddening cup, up, from his couch doth wake, And—told by crowds that old Lyæan craft Beguiled him, till he skipt, and mouthed, and laught, As one moon-struck,—now, ebriate with rage, Dashes to earth the foul venenose draught: So changed, from pride to ire, the thought-smit sage: As if the soul now spurned her self-wrought vassalage. 30 Descending his imaginary throne With haste, upon the rugged granite peak He seemed to have laid his fancied godhead down; For, like to glow that crimsons mortal cheek, A glow of shame came o'er the lofty Greek, When, 'midst the grove, upon the mountain's sward He stood, and, couched in phrase antique, Poured forth his inmost thoughts. A rapt regard Rendered the youth while thus discoursed the ancient bard: The poetical performances of Empedocles (without mooting the question of his identity with Empedocles the tragedian) must have been considerable.—Diogenes Laertius (editio Amsteldami: Hen. Wetstenii: p. 529) records Aristotle's testimony that the character of the Agrigentine philosopher's poetry was “Homerical”, and takes especial notice of a poem on Xerxes' transit of the Hellespont, and an address or hymn to the Sun (in Apollinem proœmium). Fabricius (Bibliotheca Græca: editio Hamburgi: vol. i., p. 8II), in the list of the works of Empedocles, places three books of hexameter verse on Nature,—3,000 hexametres on Lustrations, and 600 on Medicine. In the same volume the “learned” reader may peruse a specimen of this philosopher's poetry,—being 168 lines of Greek, on the Spheres, —and may also acquaint himself with some stout reasons why Empe- docles should be considered as the real author of the celebrated “Golden Verses of Pythagoras.” 31 “Cleombrotus, thou humblest me; yet I Thy debtor am; fraternal chastisement Our spirits need, even here—O mystery Inexplicable! Vainly, on earth outwent The mind on high discovery, prescient Herself esteeming of her after-state; For Ease, Pain's issue, here, is incident, As to Earth's clime; and all unlike our fate To what we did in mortal life prognosticate. 32 “Thou findst not here deep ecstasy absorb With ravishment perpetual the soul; Although Elysian dreams yon dreaming orb Enticed thee to forsake, and flee to goal Eternal. Neither do fierce fires control Our thought with mystic torture, as they feign On earth, who now affright, and then cajole Poor trampled earthworms—picturing joy or pain Ghostly, until the mind subserves the body's chain. 33 “Here, as on earth, we feel our woe or joy Is of and from ourselves: the yearning mind Her own beatitude, and its alloy, Creates, and suffering ever intertwined, She proves, with error. Fool—I am, and blind— Amidst my fancied wisdom! What impels The soul to err? If in the right she find Her happiness concentred, why rebels The will against the judgment till it foams and swells, 34 “A tempest,—aided by the raging blast Of passion,—and the yielding soul is whirled Helplessly into guilt's black gulf, or cast On death's sharp breakers? What hath hither hurled Thy bark and mine? Our senses' sails upfurled We did esteem, by sage Philosophy, Yet was our vessel caught where fiercest curled The furious billows, and poor shipwrecks we Were left—even while we boasted our dexterity! 35 “Thou, whilst aspiring after fuller bliss Than earth affords, wert maddened with desire To realise some pure hypostasis Platonic dreamers fable from their sire, The Academian: I consuming fire Felt daily in my veins to see my race Emerge from out the foul defiling mire Of animal enjoyments that debase Their nature, and well-nigh its lineaments efface. 36 “I burned to see my species proudly count Themselves for more than brutes; and toiled to draw Them on to drink at Virtue's living fount, Whence purest pleasures flow. Alas! I saw Old vice had them besotted till some awe, Some tinge of mystery, must be allied With moral lessons; or, a futile law My scholars would esteem them. Not in pride To Etna's yawning gulph the Agrigentine hied: 37 “I loved my kind; and, eager to exalt Them into gods, to be esteemed a god I coveted: thinking none would revolt From godlike virtue when the awful nod Divine affirmed its precepts. Thus, to fraud Strong zeal for virtue led me! Canst thou blame My course? I tell thee, thirst for human laud Impelled me not: 'twas my sole-thoughted aim To render Man, my brother, worthy his high name!” 38 So spake Empedocles; and him the youth Thus answered:—“Mystery, that for ever grows More complex as we, ardent, seek for truth, Doth still encompass us! Thy words disclose A tide of thoughts; and o'er my spirit flows Wave after wave, bearing me, nerveless, from My fancied height: as when, by acheful throes, Self-castaway, the shelving rock I clomb, The sea asserted o'er my limbs its masterdom. 39 “My chiefest marvel is that Wisdom's son, Thyself, should, after ages have gone o'er Him, and his race unto the tomb is run, Still feel anxieties which earth's old shore Convert to hell. Empedocles, no more Mix palliation with confession, guise Of fraud with truth! If, in thy heart's deep core, Thou hadst not erred, why, by the grand assize Of the soul's Judge, dost thou in Hades agonise? 40 “No longer from thy judgment seek to hide The truth indisputable—that thy heart Was moved, like every human heart, by pride— That subtle poison which with fatal smart, Man's spirit penetrates, and doth impart Its hateful tinct even to his pearliest deeds. Whence rise the spectrous forms that flit athwart Thy mental vision here? Thy thought—why breeds It still Pride's haughty plant, unless from earth-sown seeds? 41 “I question not the truth of thy deep love For virtue, for man's happiness thy zeal. The highest testimonies to the philanthropy, humane exercise of his medical skill, liberality in the disposition of his wealth, and democratic spirit of Empedocles, are given by Laertius and others.— See Stanley's or Enfield's “History of Philosophy.” Empedocles, thou knowst my soul hath clove To thine for ages, in these shades: we feel Our heart congenial while we thus reveal Its throbbings to the core. Oh! not in hate Or mockery do I once again appeal Unto thy nobler thought. Though sad our state, Let us from self-deceit the soul emancipate!”— 42 He ceased; and thus the Agrigentine sage Replied:—“Cleombrotus, in me, again, Thou call'st forth gratitude: self-cozenage, How low, how mean, how imbecile and vain! Yet, humbled, I discern its hateful stain Within my essence, still: would thou hadst torn My last disguise away, and bruised the reign Of my deceits, eternally!—Upborne From hence, then would the soul find some more blest sojourn. 43 “And why cannot the soul her strength exert Even now? Age after age this irksome feud With frailty we sustain, or, all inert, Droop o'er our woe, and, passive mourn! Endued With power our being is: this torpitude Let us shake off! We loathe the stain we see Still cleaving to us: let the will denude The soul of frailty! Now for victory Let essence dare, and scale this Mount of Vanity!”— 44 With wild fanatic light his visage glowed And kindred fire began forthwith to gleam In the youth's eyes:—“With mystic might endowed I feel we are!”—he cried:“with might supreme! The soul shall sun herself amid the beam Ecstatic, where Elysian flowers bloom In fields of ceaseless verdure, and where stream The waters of rejuvenescence! Gloom Shall cease! these shades are not the soul's perpetual doom! 45 “Now, let us mount! Haste, haste, Empedocles! My brother, haste! Our spirits' law delay Brooks not: let us the favouring current seize That now the soul bears onward!”— Swift away, I saw them, as I dreamed, sanguine and gay Of heart as children, join the toiling crew Of motley shapes and guises, that for aye, Clomb up to gain some peak, winning no view, They sought, but seeming, still, their struggle to renew. 46 My spirit, with a vague, wild ardour rapt, Seemed speedily to mingle with this host. And, as I gazed, sleek, supple forms that aped Deep sanctity, sighing, trudged on, and crossed Themselves. Of sable hue, full many a ghost Was there that called on Brahm, and Juggernaut, Veeshnu, and Seeva, and Kalee: these tossed Their frantic forms, and writhed, and wildly smote Upon their breasts—seeming with ecstasy distraught. 47 And turbaned shapes were there that proudly frowned On all around them, and ‘Allah akbar!’ Proclaimed: whereat ‘Christ shield us from Mahound!’ A band exclaimed that signs of antique war Displayed, their zeal and guise alike bizarre, Shirted in steel and visored; while loud rung The air of Hades with unholy jar Of chivalrous chartel they fiercely flung At their grim Paynim foemen, with obstreperous tongue. 48 Anathemas and hells eternal waged They next against each other,—losing sense Of their strange afterstate,—so madly raged Each bigot at his fellow's difference Of madness. Memory of their woes intense Returning, each made halt and turned to scorn His neighbour's cowardice, with spite prepense, For blighted self-destroyer that must mourn In endless pain, with torturous hope of end still torn.— 49 And now gave o'er their lunatic pursuit The Graian sage and youth I first perceived Upon the mount. Amid the mad dispute Of million zealots they seemed each bereaved Of self-possession, till, anon they cleaved A way from out the crowd, and sat them down, Wearied and strife-worn, while their spirits grieved With more than mortal agony: all flown Their dreams, and their wild hopes brought back to Hades' zone! 50 Long space, and gloomy, of existence past, In which, with silent grief, the spirits twain Seemed overwhelmed, and each enthusiast His face averted from his brother, fain To hide his shame, and struggling to sustain His own peculiar woe. At length outburst Cleombrotus, unable to restrain His swelling sorrow:—“Evermore accurst”— He cried,—“be memory of him who kindled thirst 51 “Within me for some vaguely imagined good, Unproven by the soul, and whether ill Or good unknown; since oft false likelihood Befools the mind, oft she impels the will To grasp a hemlock where she thought to fill Her embrace with the rose. My mortal state Why did I scorn? Not seldom, sweetest thrill Of pleasure follows pain: joys mitigate Worst woe: Men share no irremediable fate: 52 “Sorrow, on earth, hath uses: nutritive Of joys griefs often prove; and power to find Pleasures unfound before pains, friendly, give. O state beyond compare! and for the mind And body framed benignly! Weak and blind And thoughtless was my wish for unmixt joy Perpetual, since alternate pain designed Satiety of pleasure to destroy I now discern. Could ceaseless pleasure fail to cloy? 53 “Alas! in vain I reason!—vainly charge My tortured spirit with her last foul leap— Her darkest, deepest stain! While on the marge Of jeopardy this lessoning might keep The soul from error; but when once the steep She clears, sage counsels no deliverance bring. Yet, why do I permit despair to sweep Away all hope? Unto the weakest thing, For help, the seaman 'midst the strife of death will cling: 54 “To weeds—to quicksands—to the cresting foam Of the wild waves themselves! And shall she sink, The deathless spirit,—in self-exiled home,— Where yet remains her boundless power to think O luxury ineffable, since link To link the spiritual Cyclops swift And stronger may forge,—till to the very brink Of space her tether reach! This matchless gift Is still her portion: shall she not of it make thrift? 55 “Empedocles, my brother, once more tell To me thy spirit's woes or joys: once more Let us together struggle to expel Our sense of pain, and the wide realm explore Of deepest cogitation: that vast shore We can, unfettered, visit, and still glean Its metaphysic splendours, as of yore: Let us our travel to the fair demesne Of Mind essay,—the land of truest evergreen!”— 56 “Cleombrotus, my spirit doth respond To thine, with joy!”—replied Empedocles: “The soul her wingëd steed, caparisoned For venturous travel, mounts, and on the breeze Discursive pants to ride: from far she sees Her promised conquests; for thou well hast told, And truly, intellectual pleasures please When other joys are joyless. But, behold! Where comes to share our converse the wise Indian old: 57 “He whom Emathian Philip's son beheld Amazed,—while pealing trumpets cleaved the sky, And warrior hosts the wondering tumult swelled— Ride, on his goaded steed, undauntedly, Into the funeral flame,—scorning to die By nature's gradual law! Hail Calanus!” The self-immolation of this Indian philosopher, in the presence of Alexander the Great, is described, with some variations of circum-stance, by Arrian, Plutarch, and others. King Sudraka, author of the Sanscrit drama “Mrichchacati, or the Toy Cart,” (recently translated by Professor Horace Hayman Wilson), also burnt himself to death, as a religious consummation of mortal life, about, it is supposed, 192 years before Christ.— The sage spake on—for, now, the Indian nigh Appeared; “full timely comest thou, friend, with us To share, as oft before, the descant emulous. 58 “The theme of mystery,—What Existence is,— Begin! Whence Pain and Pleasure, Hope, Despair? Why Truth in endless metamorphosis Doth shroud herself. How Wisdom may declare Her precept best; and how she best may snare The vulgar crowd her lessons to observe, Thereby to elevate and bless—” “Forbear!”— The Indian cried, with look of power and nerve: “How blindly dost thou, still, from truth and wisdom swerve! 59 “Empedocles, in sooth I say thou errst, As when on earth. Yet, thy clay trammels thou, By long sojourn in Hades, shouldst have burst. Falsehood and ignorance will ever bow The human soul; and urge it, base and low, To grovel in the dust. Falsehood and sooth Breed no amalgam. Flame from flood shall flow,— The summer's sun shed drops congealed,—and Youth Be sire unto Old Age,—ere Lies shall nurture Truth! 60 “O Greek, called wise, think how old earth hath mourned And bled, through ages, by the mixture foul Of fraud with truth! Would that thy heart suborned Had never been by pride, a false control To forge for Virtue o'er the human soul! How would the universal race of man Have joined thy lofty labour to extol,— Thy high emprise of goodness, if the ban Of evil mystery had not obscured thy plan! 61 “I speak not here to wound thee; but I joy That Vulcan's fabled forge cast out, in scorn, Thy sandals' brazen soles, for base alloy, Diogenes Laertius gives authorities for his relation that the mode of Empedocles' suicide was discovered by the casting up of his brazen sandals from the crater of Etna: other ancient authors discredit the entire narrative. And thus the flimsy veil in twain was torn That hid thy apish godhead. Hadst thou worn The false divinity thou soughtst, thy shrine Had only swelled the slavish burthen borne By sottish man of priestly craft malign:— The enwoven fraud had frustrated thy scheme benign!”— 62 Eager response unto the Indian gave The Agrigentine bard:—“If not by aid Of harmless fraud,”—he said,—“how couldst thou save The sons of degradation that have strayed In Folly's paths until the comely maid, Fair Virtue, seems, from her uncomely dress, Unfair?” “Call not fraud—harmless!”—said the Shade With sable visage:—“Shadow bodiless Of Fraud would curse a world with its flagitiousness: 63 “Tinct, grain of falsehood, would a cureless plague A leprosy o' the heart, in mankind breed! Empedocles,—thy wisdom still is vague, Miscalculating, blind; and still succeed To thee, on earth, they who mankind mislead, Without thy real philanthropy engraffed Within their hearts, but mixing with their greed For praise or gold, a larger share of craft: How long and loud the fablers at the easy world have laughed! 64 “And still sleek fablers thrive; whilst thou to flame Gavest thy frail life, and for thyself hast won— What?—Folly's laurels and a madman's fame! The time will come, O Hellene! when the sun Shall look upon a world no more o'errun With slaves to sensualism; when haggard Spite, And frowning Pride, and Envy pale shall shun Truth's glorious beams, and Love's celestial light— They twain that shall be one, by hymeneals bright! 65 “Glad Earth shall wed them: to the nuptial-feast, The banquet sempiternal, new-born Faith Shall call the nations: fairest Peace, sweet Rest, And holy Joy, shall minister with breath Ambrosial at the bridal: demon wrath Against their brethren, cruelty through lure Of gold, strife for the conqueror's wreath of death, The strong shall loathe: the weak shall wear, secure, Their stronger brethren's love—that heaven-wrought armature! 66 “How blest that nuptial reign! The strong shall seek Their strength to nurture, hourly, with the dews Of Pity and Mercy; visiting, with meek Yet fervid zeal, Pain's couch, and Want's purlieus; Creating health for sickness, hopeful views Of life for dark despondence; breaking bread To weeping orphans; and the withered thews Of age cheering with raiment; till, outspread In smiles, Earth is one mother's hearth where brethren tread! 67 “The time will come! But, ere that bridal-day Dawn on our ancient home, Knowledge must win, By toilsome steps and slow, her widening way: Knowledge—the new-born world's great heroine That shall be—when, of knight and paladin, Tartar and Mameluke, legion and cohort And phalanx, fame hath fled; when War's huge sin Hath ceased; and ‘Glory,’ ravening kings' fell sport, Is chronicled with tales of murderous report. 68 “O Greek, hadst thou a lowly pioneer Aspired to be of Knowledge, and disdained To be esteemed, by Greeks, a fit compeer Of myriad mongrel gods, mankind had gained By thee, perchance, a gift worth thanks unfeigned; And lasting honours to thy memory Exultant lands had rendered, disenchained From ignorance, and craft, and tyranny.— Yet it will come—that trump of world-spread jubilee! 69 The time will come! Young Knowledge on her march Already speeds! Her march of suffering toil, And peaceful hardihood, of patient search And tireless zeal. Forth from his snaky coil Old Superstition springs, and Power his foil Of sword and chain opposeth to her steps— But all in vain! She counts them for a spoil! And conquering and to conquer, forth she sweeps O'er alp, and vale, and strand; and bounds across the deeps! 70 “Now beams on Thulè's shore her genial torch: Yea, there her central temple proudly stands: And lo! who greets her at the stately porch— An awful-fronted sage, from whom her hands Receive an ensign which on high expands Amid the breeze: that peerless gonfalon Monarchs and Priests behold, and think their sands Are numbered; for aghast, they read upon Its scroll ‘Knowledge is Power!’ They fear their craft undone! 71 “They quake—they bow—and soon shall disappear Their twin theurgies—for the nations wake! Knowledge, the great Enfranchiser, is near! Yet, though their bonds the wide world's helots break, They seek not in their tyrants' blood to slake A thirst for vengeance. Knowledge desolates No mother's hearth—no brother's home: they take Revenge in mercy, whom she emancipates: His carrion maw, tracking her steps, no vulture sates: 72 “The dogs of carnage prowl not where she treads: Beneath her steps the sterile desart smiles; And o'er the wintry waste its perfume sheds The vernal rose: along the forest aisles Earth's seraphim awake: her breath beguiles Old Nature's self! I see their rays appear— The beauteous bridal pair! Through islet piles I hear the shout that Truth and Love are near: For Knowledge wins her way—their radiant harbinger!”— 73 So spake the Indian sage, and stood enrapt In ecstasy prophetic, as, of old, The Pythoness afflate who, struggling shaped To mortal sounds what the Immortal told. Silence applausive, that with mystic mould Of spirits consorts, the Twain long held. His trance Of admiration first the youth controlled: “I burn with wish,”—he said,—“that Fate or Chance Had granted us of clay a later heritance: 74 “What raptures then had been our portion! Now We wrestle with our lot in hope: for yet Hope unto us remains; and on thy brow, O Calanus, methinks, are brightly met Rays of a hope for Hades. Shall thy debt And ours to angered Providence be purged By ages of endurance, here, beset With strange alternate woes? For either urged By hope we strive; or, in despair all strife is merged 75 “In wretchedness of dull, grave-cold despair. Say, sable spirit, what thou knowst of rest That shall be ours!”— With look of anxious care, He ceased, impatient for reply. Unblest, Humbled, regretful, thought and speech confest Empedocles; and he, ere deeper gauge Of thought the Indian took, thus urged his quest: “Some glimpse of joy,”he said, “my thoughts presage:— This shall not be the soul's eternal heritage: 76 “The spirit shall escape her prison-house: But thou, O Sage,—to whom mind more intense Hath brought deep knowledge,—who with luminous Perceptions art endowed, and opulence Of reasoning power, like to the prescience Of gods,—tell forth what hope of blissful end To these our changeful woes, or what suspense Of agony, thou dost foreknow. Could we amend The past, my soul should truth no more with foul fraud blend: 77 “Bright truth with grovelling fraud. Too late I see Wide wanderings with my fancied rectitude Enmixt. But why this Mount of Vanity,— So called by souls that have, for aye, renewed Their strife to win its peak,—still unsubdued Their sanguine zeal, though fruitless,—why assign The gods our portion here? Torturous soul-feud Of myriad forms hath Hades,—but divine,— If that thou canst,—why hold we this abhorr'd confine? 78 “What Power appoints to us, with minds at large, This mountain-prison? Why, in this duresse, Deemed we, but now, our spirits on the marge Of ecstasy's eternal boundlessness, And then, again, surged, wrecked, and shelterless, On agony's shore, ourselves imagined? Though Mysterious agencies on us impress Their purposes,—thou, Calanus, mayst know What these, the wondering soul's perplexities, foreshow.”— 79 “Perplexed I am for answer,”—in my dream The Indian seemed to say:—“Here banishment From earth is self-inflicted; and I deem Some mystic law consociates spirits pent In this strange realm of penance. They who rent Themselves from earth, impelled by painful force Of ill-requited passion, live unblent With spirits who through torturous remorse Fled hither to embrace the self-destroyer's curse: 80 “And they whom slights and treacheries have pierced With thousand arrows; or, whom children's hate Hath heart-galled; or, whose actions misrehearsed, The pitiless world hath phrensied; or, whom Fate Or circumstance hath failed to elevate Above their fellows, till with their own hand They broke life's bonds, hold here a various state. From these the Poet and the Patriot band, Self-exiles, dwell apart, in this mysterious land. 81 “Nor seems it purposeless that we who reft Ourselves of earth's mixt joys through thirst to drink Of ecstasy unmixt, should thus be left At large, as heretofore, to dream and think; And, while imagining we reach the brink Of purest joy, should feel ourselves still tossed On hope's conflicting wave, then feebly sink Desponding. If, upon this mystic coast, Each wandering soul with dreams and visions be engrossed 82 “Analogous to dreams and visions which In mortal life engrossed her, 'midst the crowd Of stern realities,—if glozing speech Mislead her, as on earth,—and mists enshroud Her vision till all essence with a cloud Is wrapt,—and doubt asks whether she exists Or not,—why, let our struggling will be bowed! It is our spirits' law,—and, as Fate lists We live: in vain this law our rebel will resists. 83 “Shall we live thus for ever,—or hath hope Foundation firm for joys—pure joys to come? Perplexed I answer: We but guess and grope For this the jewel of our search: unwomb Herself Truth may: but, in the heart of gloom She still hides this her gem of gems. The mind Oft asks how gods their progeny can doom To endless, hopeless woe: but what, if blind Necessity grasps all! Who shall her grasp unbind? 84 “Oft speak we of deep sympathies enwove In flesh-freed Essences with men on earth, Foretelling that when Truth shall wed with Love 'Mong mortals, spirits in Hades shall, thenceforth, Experience wondrous change,—the soul new birth Shall have of wisdom,—false distinctions cease,— Or they have highest honour who in worth Of virtue most excel,—penance to peace For ever shall be changed,—and ever know increase. 85 “With ye not seldom, Hellenes sage, I share These sanguine thoughts; but souls of Kings ask whence Derive we our bright hope. Summons I bear Unto our mountain realm—that high souls hence Betake them where, in pictured affluence Of power, Monarchs hold thrones, when lapse of pain To them, with us, Nature's behests dispense. Since Kings yield parley, think ye that in vain Truth's devotees 'fore thrones shall themes of Truth maintain? 86 “Spirits, ye beam with thoughts that antedate Triumph of Truth and Right; and I partake Your deep prophetic joy. What though dark hate Bosoms of kings usurps?—Love shall awake In gentleness omnipotent, and make Her meekest throne within their souls,—for they Are human,—and all human souls shall break Their vassalage to Wrong. Alas!—dismay Of doubt begins, anew, to seek me for its prey! 87 “Empedocles!—Cleombrotus!—our life In Hades, as on earth, is mystery: Our being is a contest and a strife Of self with self: thus struggling to be free We add unto our fetters: while we flee— Or think we flee—from folly, we are more Than ever fools! The soul, a refugee In Hades from Earth's woes, her woes deplore In deeper woe may, endlessly;—or with new power 88 “Endowed, may yet launch out her fragile bark Adventurously, and find some sea of bliss,— Some unknown flood of light,—and, far from dark And dismal storms of doubt, emparadise Herself—” Anon, from vague hypothesis The Indian fell again to doubtings void, Till like his speech, his form itself, I wis, Grew dim; and with its brother forms did glide Into the womb of Nought:—the vision was destroyed! BOOK THE THIRD. 1 Hail, glorious Sun! All hail the captive's friend! Giver of purest joys, where Sorrow fain Would enter and abide, and, traitorous, lend Her power to aggravate the tyrant's chain: Great Exorcist, that bringest up the train Of childhood's joyaunce, and youth's dazzling dreams From the heart's sepulchre, until, again, I live in ecstasy, 'mid woods, and streams, And golden flowers that laugh while kissed by thy bright beams. 2 Ay, once more, mirrored in the silver Trent, Thy noon-tide majesty I think I view With boyish wonder; or, till drowsed and spent With eagerness, peer up the vaulted blue With shaded eyes, watching the lark pursue Her dizzy flight; then, on a fragrant bed Of meadow sweets still sprent with morning dew, Dream how the heavenly chambers overhead With steps of grace and joy the holy angels tread. 3 Of voices sweet, and harps with golden wires Touched by the fingers of the seraph throng; Of radiant vision which the cherub choirs Witness, with jubilee of rapturous song, And without weariness their joy prolong, I lie and dream, till, with a start, I wake, Thinking my mother's home is still among Earth's children, and her yearning heart will ache, If, for those angel joys, her smile I should forsake.— 4 O heart, now cold in the devouring grave, And torn, no more, by scorn and suffering, How fondly didst thou to thy darling cleave! Although thy tyrants but a worthless thing Esteemed him. Rankled, deep, oppression's sting In thy recesses: still, in hardihood Of conscious right, stern challenge thou didst fling Back at thy foemen and their hireling brood; And beat unto old age with free and youthful blood! 5 Mother, thy wrongs, the common wrongs of all To labour doomed by proud and selfish drones, Enduringly have fixed the burning gall Deep in my veins—ay, in my very bones. I hate ye, things with surplices and crowns! Serpents that poison, tigers that devour Poor human kind, and fill the earth with groans, Through every clime! God send ye were no more! Ye'd have a merry requiem, from shore to shore! 6 Taxes for king and priest a knave was wont To filch from my poor widowed mother's toil; And while the prowling jackal held his hunt, He battened on the offals of the spoil, And mocked the sufferers! How my blood did boil When lately I beheld a gilded stone Raised to the memory of this vermin vile, And pious charity ascribed thereon To him who gray beneath the Poor's grim curse had grown! 7 I laid my aged mother near the dust Of her oppressor; but no gilded verse Tells how she toiled to win her child a crust, And, fasting, still toiled on: no rhymes rehearse How tenderly she strove to be the nurse Of truth and nobleness in her loved boy, 'Spite of his rags— O Sun! thou dost amerce My mournful heart, for the poor fleeting joy With which thy beams began my sadness to destroy. 8 Bright Gazer on the wilderness of woe Called Earth, dost thou above in mockery smile Like human crowds thou look'st upon below? I fondly hoped thou wouldst, a little while, The captive of his cankerous care beguile; But, for one glimpse of childhood's cheerful bloom, Thou hast brought back upon my heart a pile Of achings kindred to the dreary tomb; And mak'st me feel I hasten to that realm of gloom. 9 What—when my torturers have had their fill Of vengeance—If I, once more, freely range, Beneath thy radiance, over vale and hill, Through tangled wood, by stream, and moated grange, And festooned castle wall? Deep thoughts of change And sadness will the flowers of childhood bring: I shall be companied with voices strange To childhood's rapture, and unskilled to sing The merry song with which we made the welkin ring: 10 Sorrow will follow song of matin merle And vesper throstle where young joys I took: For, of the dead, where Lindsey's streamlets purl, Remembrances are writ, in Nature's book; The gentle violet may as sweetly look And heavenly blue as it was wont to glow: But, like that darling floret by the brook, 'Twill breathe—‘Forget-me-not!’—and I shall bow In grief, remembering there that joyous hearts lie low.— 11 Thou gorgeous lamp to light man to the home Appointed for all living!—though elate With throb of liberty regained I roam O'er paths to Life's glad morning consecrate, Will not thy flame foreshew that for me wait Death's prison-portals, and I do but stay At large on sufferance? For, the writ of Fate Will soon arrive, which not a breath's delay Brooks, of their full surrender, from the forms of clay. 12 Oh! couldst thou bare that dark captivity From whence, released, none ever yet returned To tell its secrets, how our dreams would flee! Was it to know Death's truths, in life, that yearned The hoary Kelt who on the cromlech burned His brother, hymning thee, the sky-throned god? For ages, Man thy huge gray shrines hath spurned, Mocking thy worship; but, like all who trod Earth then, in dreams, still dream the children of the clod! 13 And thou, thyself, all glorious as thou art, Supernal Sun!—what art thou but a dream? A splendid vanity—a glittering part Of the vast aggregate of things that seem? How know I that with veritable beam Thou dost illume this earth and sister spheres? Or, whether they and thou, mere fictions, teem From Mind, and thy great glory but appears— Not is—and will, with thy beholders, fade with years? 14 Hath Mind, more truly, substance, then, than thou, Great Sun?— Oh! how poor human thought doth mock Itself! I think I see: I think I know! What further? Nought—to worms! Although ye knock At Truth's dark barriers, they will bear the shock Till doomsday—if it ever come! If sleep Eternal comes, instead, then, at a stroke, Away, it will hope, faith, and doubting sweep: And, if we cease to be; why—we shall cease to weep. 15 Alas!—the soul doth seek to gather balm, In vain, from barrenness: alternative So frigid, blank, and bare, affords no calm To him whose heart desires for aye to live; And yet doth palpitate, despond, misgive, More than it hopes.— Resplendent light! now wanes Thy beam; yet, who the morrow shall survive To see, shall thee behold gilding the plains, And hear thy gladdened birds rechant their joyous strains: 16 And thus, my brother-worms, in days of eld, Looked on thy resurrection, and believed That since thy disentombment they behold Each morn, thou hadst a symbol for them weaved Of glorious life to follow death: reprieved From fear of what I fear, they danced, they sung, And on the mountains where so late they grieved, And wailed their dead, gay trophies to thee hung, And shouted thy high praise till hill and valley rung! 17 Baal, whose mighty tabernacles rose, Roofed by the sky,—from Babel to Stonehenge; Whose Beltein fire her mountain child still shows On Caledonia's hills, 'spite of all change: Boodh, Veeshnu, Chrishna, of old shasters strange, Through ages hymned by Hindoo devotee: Osiris, whose dark murder to avenge Pale Isis nightly glowed o'er Mitzraim's sea— Old priestly Nile that glads the land of mystery: 18 Mithras, high deity of gorgeous Mede: Thammuz, or Adad, of Chaldaic seer, Or old Phœnician by the Hebrew's seed Supplanted: Titan, or Hyperion, fear Of new-fledged gods, assailed in cloudy sphere Olympic: Phœbus or Apollo, bright And young and fair, throughout the rolling year Circled with song, or from the Delphic height, Breathing dim oracles, 'mid priest-enriching rite: 19 God, claimed by regal Incas as their sire Beyond the wave Columbian, where upcone Earth's storehouses of silver: Sovereign fire! The young soul's natural god! Visible throne Of holy Nature's Sovereignty unknown Invisible!—by whatsoever name Adored and deified throughout our zone, Thy worshippers all held thy risen flame Did for the soul adumbrate some great after-drame! 20 On shadows leaning, these did vaguely urge Their dreaming pilgrimage; and, lest I lean On shadows too—though thousand lights converge To deck with loveliness the Nazarene— I hesitate, demur, surmise, and glean, Daily, new grounds to doubt the Mythic dress— Phœnician woof, once more!—through which is seen, I fear, thy ancient face—bright Comeliness!— Fabling with future life poor grave-doomed worms to bless! 21 He whom the Arimathean's tomb enclosed— The Toiler blest, who on the vile cross died— But, 'spite of guards, the bonds of death unloosed, Scattering the men of iron in their pride Convulsed to helplessness, and forth did ride Leading captivity captive!—Is he not— Magnific beam!—thy power personified— Night-tombed—and, then, pouring dismay and rout On Darkness, while Earth's million morning-voices shout? 22 I love the Galilean; Lord and Christ Such goodness I could own; and, though enshrined In flesh, could worship: If emparadised, Beyond the grave, no Eden I could find Restored, though all the good of humankind Were there, and not that yearning One, the Poor Who healed, and fed, and blest! Nay, to my mind, Hell would be Heaven, with him! Horror no more Could fright, if such benignant beauty trod its shore! 23 I love the sweet and simple narrative, With all its childlike earnestness—the page Of love-wrought wonders which in memory live: I would the tale were true: that heritage Of immortality it doth presage Would make me glad indeed. But doubts becloud Truth's fountains as their depths I seek to gauge,— Till with this trustless reckoning I am bowed— Man's heritage is but a cradle and a shroud!— 24 Hark!—'tis the turnkey!—and those bars and bolts Jar their harsh summons to my nightly nook. Farewell, grand Sun! How my weak heart revolts At that appalling thought—that my last look At thy great light must come! Oh! I could brook The dungeon, though eterne!—the Priests' own hell, Ay, or a thousand hells, in thought, unshook, Rather than Nothingness! And yet the knell, I fear, is near, that sounds—To consciousness farewell! 25 After these day-dreams 'neath the summer's sun, The Soul—I mean, the something that doth think And dream: Name it aright, thou knowing one Who kennst the Essence which doth ever shrink From its own scrutiny!—began to link Night's images to forms she waking saw With the interior eye.— Upon the brink Of a wild lake I stood, and viewed with awe, Again unveiled, the realm of suicidal woe! 26 The spacious wave, before me, tempest-gloomed And bleak and storm-tost, howled; and I seemed frore With cold; and shuddering, felt as if foredoomed To sense of mortal hunger. On the shore I wandered, while my thoughts, amid the roar Of winds and waters, dwelt on One who stilled The waves, and fed the hungry: and the more I seemed to be with sense of hunger thrilled And cold, the more that Form my inward vision filled. 27 And still I wandered by the howling lake, Imagining what joy succeeded fear In the poor fishers, when their Master spake From the night-wave, and said,—‘Be of good cheer! 'Tis I!’—while one sprang out to meet Him there, But would have sunk, had not the meek One's hand Him rescued. ‘Who’—I cried—‘would not revere ‘Such power and love? Worship I, on this strand, Would give the Nazarene—did He these waves command.’ 28 The soul, in her impassioned workings, seemed To have spoken audibly,—whereat, a sound, Or what was likest sound—came, as I dreamed, Forth from the caves that hemmed that lake around, Appalling, as when one with mortal wound Is struck, and utters his last agony Of wild despair. A face that did astound My spirit met me, as I turned to see What form to wildly wail on that stern shore might be. 29 Tongue cannot syllable the blighting curse To which that visage gave soul-utterance: For mastery—guilt, despair, wrath, shame, remorse, Contended, in each petrifying glance; And still their contest burning sustenance Drew evermore from the consuming blaze Within:—‘My being's ceaseless heritance ‘Is agony!’—seemed written in that gaze, In letters not a universe of joy could raze: 30 It was a look unique in wretchedness: Such as, in land of penance, could be worn By none but him who, in his heart's excess Of ill, his gust for guilt, engrained, inborn, Betrayed to shameful death, and vilest scorn Of butchering priests, the Being who only sought To bless mankind and die! The look of lorn Remediless woe with which that face was fraught Needed no speech to tell—it marked Iscariot. 31 The guilty spirit knew that he was known: So livingly the soul made manifest Her inmost workings, in that visioned zone.— “And who art thou?”—the spirit of unrest Exclaimed,—“that hither comest on prying quest To view Perdition's Son? Let the dark sign Of thy self-murder, which these shades unblest Sternly reveal, restrain thy thought malign: How knowst thou my soul's deed more criminal than thine? 32 “Worship to Him my treason brought to shame Thou talkst of rendering, did he here display His power and love,—feigning to shift the blame Of thy foul unbelief—(thy words bewray Thy atheist heart!)—on Him who bears high sway Above, and, in the chequered roll of time, Allots each paltry worm his little day. Away—dissembler! Distant age and clime Excuse not unbelief: 'tis the soul's self-spawned crime! 33 “Depart, proud unbeliever! Let suffice That thou hast spied the Traitor: now thine eye Fix on thine own earth-stains: plan new device Elsewhere, thy heart with doubt to petrify Tenfold,—but stay not here! No sceptic spy Shall bide with me: my desolateness I'll share With none: these blasting shores,—the howling cry Of this wild lake, are my companions! Dare Not thou to offer fellowship with my despair!” 34 He ceased, a while; but I no vigour felt To utter speech, or flee. As if a spell Flowed from the spirit's eyes, and, entering, dwelt Within my being's fenceless citadel, I stood transfixt, and terror-frore! Rebel Against this silent helplessness, or break The spell of dread, I could not; though, to tell My heart unto the fallen one, with ache Unutterable, I yearned! Again, Iscariot spake:— 35 “Doth still delay? Fearest thou to go alone? Take with thee, then, from out my serpent cave, For company, yon wretched, prostrate one. Come,—hear him, in his guilt-struck madness, rave, And cry he cannot the fierce scorn outbrave Of all he meets in Hell!—though in Earth's life, He outfaced cursings dread, until they clave Unto his coward soul; and, now, the strife Of condign woe within, his face doth hieroglyph. 36 “Come, see if thou canst read! Thy frozen isle He lately fled. Belike of brotherhood, The memory, may revive this thing of guile— This viper fell, that drained his country's blood, And then let out his own! From his low mood Of infantile despair thy form may serve This cast-off sleuth-hound of the craven brood To rouse, once more. Follow!—if thou hast nerve Of soul to look on horror, nor from courage swerve!” 37 I followed: for, albeit the spell of dread Forbade my utterance still,—desire prevailed, And power returned, to move. The spirit led Where sterner horrors my rapt soul assailed: Crowds of huge snakes their coils innumerous trailed, Forming a labyrinthine cave, vast volve On volve, with scales impenetrable mailed, All seeming fierce the mandate to dissolve That held them there their mighty folds to circumvolve. 38 How achingly their eyes, amidst their wrath, Large pain expressed, and how my fear was blent With sympathetic pain, as on that path, Encompassed, thick, with torturous coils, I went, Life's waking wave with Sleep's stream confluent Can never from my beating brain efface: Designed for deepest treason's chastisement That cavern seemed: goal for sin's fiercest race: The bourne for Guilt too foul its footsteps to retrace! 39 A livid, baleful light the serpents clothed, Or seemed to issue forth each burning throat The monsters ever showed. The frayed soul loathed Her vision, with such shuddering horror fraught, And prayed for gloom. At length, Iscariot raught A space circled with snakes in deathly array Upreared, pointing with forked tongues, where smote His breast, as on the rocky floor he lay In speechless agony—the suicide of Cray!— 40 “Arise, and see how curl thy brother snakes Around thee!”—cried the tortured Hebrew ghost:— “Look on the torment which at length o'ertakes The perjured traitor on that cursed coast He ploughed Life's sea to find! Vile viper! lost, Abhorred! driven forth of all in Hell's own realm! Arise, I say, nor lie thus torn and tossed,— Tyrant, who swayed a triple nation's helm, Erewhile, and mocked while suffering did the land o'er-whelm!” 41 By mortal images her dread describe Cannot the waking mind, recalling, sad, That dream, and memory of each horrid gibe Iscariot uttered, as if wildly glad To vent his rage, and pain to superadd Unto his fellow's pain! Rackt, speechless, prone, While his curved spine the huge snakes cupolaed, And venomed anger from their eyes outshone,— O'erwhelmed, soul-numbed with woe, remained the prostrate one. 42 “Will no taunt rouse Hibernia's fallen child,— Her cut-throat and his own?” Judas resumed; And swift, the snakes, the prone form leaving, coiled Around the Jew their frightful folds, and fumed More wildly as he raged:—“What hath be-rheumed “Thy courage, mighty parasite? On earth A prince! With worm-worn monarchs catacombed! How, after all thy greatness, can this dearth Of pride enshroud thee? Wilt thou wake old Hell to mirth! 43 “Vile pandar to the pomp-blown, lust-swoln Guelph; Rise, I adjure thee, and betake thee hence! I will be fellow to Hell's inmost self, Rather than unto thee, trickster prepense, And double-dealer in each mean pretence For forging fetters to thy fatherland! Her champion—first; and then—true subsequence Of falsehood—tool, her slavery that planned, And for his guilty wages stretched his guilty hand! 44 “Traitor, that sold his country for a price, And then—” “Traitor!”—the prostrate shape outburst;— “A price! Did I my Master, with device Of a false kiss betray, to foes athirst For his most precious blood, my heart endorsed, The while, with settlement of black receipt— The thirty silver pieces?”— “Snake accurst!” Retorted Judas,—‘think not here to cheat Thy soul: my deed was foretold by the Paraclete! 45 “The Comforter on earth I never knew— But here I know Him! 'Tis my soul's support That He, who did of old the seers endue With mystic foresight, hath my being begirt With deep assurance that, though long the sport Of these strange tortures, yet, the hour will come When my freed essence shall her strength exert, And wing her way to that bright happy home Where joys, for sinners purged of stain, perpetual, bloom! 46 “My crime, in verity, belongs not me; And, therefore, penance, endless, cannot claim Me hers. I am the child of Destiny! But thou—thou self-stained thing of scorn and shame! Thou torturer of millions! whose foul aim, Self-moved, self-nurtured, was thyself to steep In crime, thy kind in tears—enduring blame Thyself must bear; and o'er thy soul shall sweep The tempest of His wrath—relentless, ceaseless, deep!”— 47 “Speak'st thou of destiny, base Jewish churl!” Fiercely the tortured, maddened minion cried,— And sprang erect; for, now, the tempest-whirl Of old, mad dreams the fallen liberticide Revisited, and puffed with fumes of pride, As erst in mortal life:—“Of destiny “Talkst thou?”—he wildly said;—“Thinkst thou to hide Thy old arch-treason, thus? How, then, may I, Much more, by Fate's behests, my life-deeds justify? 48 “Was I not beckoned, in my climbing path, By beaming visions supernatural? Shall I the sentence of eternal wrath Acknowledge just—since dreams, prophetical Of what I should be,—did my will enthral,— And bright angelic shapes, in gems and gold Bediademmed, with voice celestial, Nightly, me bade to grasp with seizure bold The prize, in Fate's weird book, for Castlereagh en-rolled—” 49 “Hah! utter not thy name—that synonym Of Villany!”—exclaimed the self-destroy'd Betrayer of the Blest;—“it doth bedim “Darkness itself to utter it! ‘Avoid That sound accurst!’—the souls in air upbuoyed, New come from Earth, in dismallest accents, yell: ‘Forbear that guilty name to tell!’—the void Waste shore and caves re-echo. Serpent fell, I charge thee, name no more thy hated self, in Hell!”— 50 Elate still reared Cray's suicide, enwrapt In old life-dreams,—the soul's habiliment Of morrice-pomp, for holidays adapt At change and full of moon, on earth. He lent No audience to this chiding; but, intent On telling his pride's dreams, began to spume, And struggle after phrase grandiloquent,— The soul's old habitude,—wherewith to exhume His moon-struck visions vain from memory's pictured tomb.— 51 “'Twas in my manhood's youth,”—he proudly said; Mine is but a poetical version of the suicide statesman's vision: here follows the prose—from Winslow's “Anatomy of Suicide” (published 1840) pp. 242-4.—“It is now more than thirty-five years ago that the following singular circumstance occurred to the Mar- quis of Londonderry: he was on a visit to a gentleman in the north of Ireland. The mansion was such a one as spectres are fabled to inhabit. The apartment, also, which was appropriated to his lord- ship was calculated to foster such a tone of feeling from its antique character; from the dark and richly carved panels of its wainscot; from its yawning chimney, looking like the entrance to a tomb; from the portraits of grim men and women arrayed in orderly pro- cession along the walls, and scowling a contemptuous enmity against the degenerate invader of their gloomy bowers and venerable halls; and from the vast, dusky, ponderous and complicated draperies that concealed the windows, and hung with the gloomy grandeur of funeral trappings about the hearse-like piece of furniture that was destined for his bed. Lord Londonderry examined his chamber; he made him- self acquainted with the forms and faces of the ancient possessors of the mansion, as they sat upright in the ebony frames to receive his salutation; and then, after dismissing his valet, he retired to bed. His candle had not long been extinguished, when he perceived a light gleaming on the draperies of the lofty canopy over his head. Conscious that there was no fire in his grate; that the curtains were closed; that the chamber had been in perfect darkness but a few minutes previously, he supposed that some intruder must have entered into his apartment; and, turning round hastily to the side from whence the light proceeded, he, to his infinite astonishment, saw, not the form of any human visitor, but the figure of a fair boy surrounded by a halo of glory. The spirit stood at some distance from his bed. Certain that his own faculties were not deceiving him, but suspect- ing he might be imposed on by the ingenuity of some of the nume- rous guests who were then inmates of the castle, Lord Londonderry advanced towards the figure; it retreated before him; as he ad- vanced the apparition retired, until it entered the gloomy arch of the capacious chimney, and then sunk into the earth. Lord London- derry returned to his bed, but not to rest; his mind was harassed by the consideration of the extraordinary event which had occurred to him. Was it real, or the effect of an excited imagination? The mystery was not so easily solved. “He resolved in the morning to make no allusion to what had occurred the previous night, until he had watched carefully the faces of all the family, to discover whether any deception had been prac- tised. When the guests assembled at breakfast, his lordship searched in vain for those latent smiles, those conscious looks, that silent communication between parties, by which the authors and abettors of such domestic conspiracies are generally betrayed. Everything apparently proceeded in its ordinary course; the conversation was animated and uninterrupted, and no indication was given that any one present had been engaged in the trick. At last, the hero of the tale found himself compelled to narrate the singular event of the preceding night. He related every particular connected with the appearance of the spectre. It excited much interest among the auditors, and various were the explanations offered. At last, the gentleman who owned the castle interrupted the various surmises by observing that ‘the circumstance which had just been recounted must naturally appear very extraordinary to those who had not been inmates long at the castle, and were not conversant with the legends of his family;’ then, turning to Lord Londonderry, he said, ‘You have seen the Radiant Boy. Be content; it is an omen of prospe- rous fortunes. I would rather that this subject should not again be mentioned.’ “This was no doubt an hallucination of the senses. On another occasion, when in the House of Commons, Lord Castlereagh fancied he saw the same ‘Radiant Boy.’ Does not this fact establish that his lordship's senses were not always in a healthy condition? It is possible that when impelled to suicide he laboured under some mental delusion.” “I tarried, for one night, fast by the wave Atlantic, where, in lovely verdure spread, Old Erin laughs to hear the north wind rave. The hall that welcomed me was old, but brave And stately stood, as stands the forest oak After five hundred autumn tempests have Against his stalwart arms their fury broke, And, eke, five hundred times stripped of his kingly cloak. 52 “The sun was sinking in the gorgeous west, As I drew near. The dark-hued ivy hung Its graceful tendrils, like a bridal vest, Around the aged walls,—while softly sung The minstrel evening breeze, with wanton tongue, That castle's marriage to King Time. Bedight With rainbow tints the clouds resplendent flung On me, on towers, and leaves,—for magic sprite Fit bower that seemed; and I some wand'ring love-spelled knight. 53 “Around my steed the giddy flittermouse Sported, in whimsical ellipse, and passed, On leathern sails, with haste to tell his spouse,— Hung, by her crooked thumbs, in chimney vast,— While listed him the owl, that sage dynast Of ruin,—that a stranger marked by Fate For princely fortunes was approaching fast The moat, and soon beneath the old arched gate Wound bend, where, hoarsely croaking, the dark corven sate”— 54 “Forbear, poor palterer, thy crazy tale Of bats and owls and ravens!”—cried the fierce And fallen Jew;—“Think of the bitter bale “Which doth in Hell thy doting soul amerce For mortal sins! Let tortures real disperse Thy lingering dreams of mock beatitude! For pity sheer, I'll list thee misrehearse Thy ditty; but in strain at least, subdued To common-sense, this false apocalypse conclude!”— 55 “My host received his guest as well beseemed The lordly tenant of this feudal tower;”— In vein ornate the patricide rethemed His air-built pride:—“His child, a peerless flower “Of loveliness, her eyes a brighter dower Than myriad pearls, drooped o'er her father's arm, As droops a lily, after evening shower, Upon its parent stem. Soft, chaste alarm Her light-veiled bosom told with undulating charm. 56 “Full lowly bowed the reverend seneschal, Girdled for state, with massive silver key, As on we pass'd into the banquet-hall: And, niched, among the antique carvery The hinds were seen on meekly bended knee, With perfumed cressets: evermore there met The ravished ear, from unseen minstrelsy, Hushed dulcet tones of harp and flageolette Blent with rapt chaunt of madrigal and canzonette. 57 “With festal revelry the banquet rang, Till tusk and antler, spear and hauberk shook, Around the baron's hall. Anon, upsprang The younger guests: his ladye-love each took: The dovelets blushed, and yielded, with coy look: Then thrilled the rebecks, while the merry dance Sped on,—until, for mirth and wine, forsook Their dizzy sport the youngsters,—still, askaunce, Eyeing each other, in their love's exuberance. 58 “'Twas midnight: and, before they said ‘farewell!’ The revellers asked a boon of harper gray,— Who dipped his beard in the gold Rhenish bell With youthful zeal,—that he for them should say, Unto his harp's loud chime, a roundelay Of olden days, in Tara's hall once told, When high O'Connor sat in proud array Of crowned regality, and Erin old, From sea to sea, with joy, bowed to the warrior bold. Roderick O'Connor,King of Connaught,— who finally surrendered his title of “Lord of all Ireland,” to our Henry II.,—seems, from Leland's account, to have been the last monarch of the ancient Irish race who held a national assembly at Tara: it is described as ‘a numerous and magnificent convention of the states, in which his grandeur and authority were so strikingly displayed, that the ancient honours of his country seemed to revive, at the very moment when all such expectations were on the point of being utterly extinguished.” 59 “I cannot to thine ear the deeds recount Of old Milesian chieftains, a stern line, The Minstrel sang: in memory's transient fount So many streams of weal and bale combine, Through life,—and then the soul her anodyne Inevitable of death must taste,—and now We drink this bitter cup in Hell's confine,— That the mind shrinks, as if from mortal throe, Her total journey, like a drudge, to overgo. 60 “Suffice it that I say that aged man Wound up his lay with patriotic tears; While my heart raged, as if a hurricane Of joys, its current, with alternate fears, Had swoln. I felt distraught as one who hears Himself pŒan'd for victory ungained As yet, but certain to be won, though years Of hate before he reach the laurel stained With blood be his: that victory's fruit—his country chained! 61 “With taper dim, through vault and thick-ribbed arch, Six aged hinds, to light me to my sleep Stept gravely on, as if in funeral march: But, when alone, how my cold skin did creep To see grim eyes upon me scowl and peep From out the oaken panels round my couch! One painted warrior looked as he would leap And crush me, for a foreign scaramouch,— Such frowning hatred did his portraiture avouch! 62 “Plumed like a hearse, a lordly canopy Adorned my bed, in old baronial mode, Its cumbrous velvet folds on ebony Supported, and their drooping festooned load Burthened with gold and jet. Breathless, I glode Into my downy nest, in darkness, while My throbbing heart 'gan thickly to forbode Some unknown ill; but struggling, I this pile Of spectrous fears threw off, as fancies infantile. 63 “Sleep fled; and soon the gray-haired harper's song Filled all my chamber, like a serenade Which some benign enchantment did prolong Until so heavenly melody it made That Darkness hasted to her nether shade, And Light held sceptre in that resting-place Of ancient pomp. O'erjoyed, and yet afraid, I gazed around—when lo! a form of grace, Haloed with glorious light, revealed its radiant face! 64 “Resting my arm upon my silken pillow, But helplessly recumbent as a child, I lay, and gazed, while, like the heaving billow, My bosom swelled; yet, though with wonder wild My hair stood up, serene, that angel mild Stood pointing to a seat nigh to a throne Limned all in light, and, with high meaning, smiled— A moment—and that visioned form had flown; But woke my soul—like warrior's at the clarion! 65 “‘Fame—fame!’—shouted my burning, bounding heart, Until my tongue made vocal its excess: ‘I will enact the splendid afterpart ‘Of life begun—this visioned beauteousness,— ‘This minstrelsy divine,—alike, confess ‘My destiny appoints! They shall not weave ‘For me, in vain, that fair viceregal dress— ‘The Fatal Sisters three! My soul shall cleave ‘Unto its toil—until it doth the palm achieve!’ 66 “Next morn, unto my grave and lordly host I did these visions of the night reveal. With deeply troubled look his breast he crossed, And spake these words: ‘Thy lips, I charge thee, seal ‘Upon this theme, if that thou wishest weal ‘To thine own soul: for signal woe or joy ‘Upon thy rest these midnight visions steal: ‘High destiny is thine, if thou destroy ‘It not—thyself! Know,—thou hast seen the Radiant Boy!’ 67 “What followed on these visitations bright—” “Enough!”—the Palestinian suicide Exclaimed: “If longer ravings to indite “Thou dost attempt, these serpents that deride Thy tale already, sequel to such pride Run mad will bring with heavy emphasis. What followed?—why, thy guilty heart was dyed With blood: thy hand, for very cowardice, Thou didst not stain—except to shorten thy life's lease 68 “What followed?—Thou art here!—Thy race of guilt, And pride and madness is, on earth, outrun; By thine own hand thy life's vile current spilt, And Hell's eternal agony begun; Yet seekst thou, like a lunatic buffoon, To mock thyself and others with the dreams That haunt the brains of each mere child o' the moon, Beneath his natal star's pale borrowed beams Sleeping, 'mid ruins gray,—or lost, by haunted streams. 69 “The Radiant Boy—forsooth! Some doating fool, Possessed with superstitious wonderment, And barbarous pride of fancied elvish rule Sway'd o'er his barbarous house,—a ready vent Found in thy crazy ear for ravings pent Too long within his heated mind. How long Wilt mock thyself? For ever thou art rent From peace; and on thy soul, with tortures strong, The poor's Avenger recompenseth, now, their wrong!” 70 “I tell thee, fierce one!—that this radiant form”— Cried the fallen lunatic,—“again I saw, While sitting in the senate; there, no swarm The moon could raise of vaporous fancies raw To juggle and mislead my brain. What law Of mind hast thou discovered, in this crypt Of horrors, that can warrant thee to draw Hope for thyself from old prophetic script— And yet to slay my soul with Fate's strong shield equipt? 71 “Shall I,—of mental liberty bereft In life;—my will, Mind's pilot, all enthralled; The soul's frail bark herself to fury left Of these tempestuous visions swift upcalled Without her own intent;—shall I, appalled With fear of justice, from His sentence shrink? The weakest worm on earth that ever crawled Would not, thus impulsed even to the brink Of life, consent to its own curse, and, yielding, sink.”— 72 “Whether thy soul to its own curse consent, Or ape the rebel,”—said Iscariot,— “That curse waits not thy blind arbitrament: 'Tis fixt—with mine: in vain we seek to blot The sentence from His book: our fatal lot Is cast,—and must be borne. Thou hadst thy tide Of sanity: if, then, her antidote The sober soul, industrious, had applied To thy disease, she would have purged this crazy pride. 73 “Thou knowst this true: then, cease thy heart to chafe With these ill-masked deceits. My soul dislodge From bulwark which Jehovah doth vouchsafe Thou canst not. Good from Evil the Great Judge Produceth: not delirious subterfuge Is this. God did appoint my soul to sin: Unto His high decree I bow: His drudge I am: His purpose answered—I shall win My seat in that bright realm where beam the sera-phin!”— 74 Evanished, now, his air of pomp superb, And shook with woe, the fallen thing of state: His frenzy fled.— “Alas! how deep reverb These shades my curse!” he cried:—“in vain I prate “Of radiant dreams, with wish to palliate My conscious guilt: I feel my sentence just! And now, with trust devout, to mitigate My woe, I'll seek: I bow to His august Decree: I, also, in His Providence will trust! 75 “Son of Perdition;—if thou wert by Heaven Designed, mysteriously, a guilty aid Of holy purposes; if, thus, the leaven Of evils which His universe pervade, By God's permission, He decreed and made A source of blessing; may not I look up Beyond the scope of this dark, joyless shade, For dawn of bliss? Unto the dregs, if hope Be there, unmurmuring, will I drink my bitter cup.”— 76 “Know, humbled tyrant,—though my soul begins Thy miseries to condole, and half forget Her own,”—spake Judas;—“penalty for sins “Thou canst not choose but feel: a deep, dark debt Of woe thou hast to pay: for thee doth whet Her torturous beak a vulture more malign Than gnawed the fabled Titan: Conscience yet Must prey upon thee, till thou wail and pine; And, still, for ages, must thou feel her fangs condign! 77 “‘Unmurmuring’—wilt thou drink of Torture's dregs? Why, thou hast not the courage of a worm When trouble truly comes: thy spirit begs For ease, ev'n now, while only in its germ Of misery, and ere the ever-countless term Of its desert of pain is, scarce, begun! How wilt thou murmur, then, against the storm Of penal wrath enhanced, and seek to shun Thy cup,—'plaining the measure doth the brim o'errun! 78 “Yet, to the bitter dregs it must be drunk! The Guelph loved fawning; but in Hell's domain, Thy power of courtier-cozenage is shrunk And withered: thou wouldst coax, and cant, and feign, With torment's executioner, in vain:— Conscience—I mean. Hah! even now the edge Of her fell tooth is sinking in thee! Pain Unintermittent,—pain without assuage,— That thou must suffer still will be the direful pledge! 79 “Thou feels thy portion just; but like a lithe And eager adder 'neath the planted hoof Of forest steed or ox, dost twist and writhe, With maddening agony. Hah! how aloof Thou stoodst from mercy, while on earth! Disproof That millions starved and suffered, thy false tongue Forged, daily: not a tear-drop in behoof Of suffering from thy stony eyes was wrung For one of all the thousands that thy treachery stung! 80 “Wilt thou deny that there is suffering—now? Now?—while the worm of conscience thou dost feel? The undying worm? Why, what is the weak woe Thy coward soul can bear,—though Hell unseal Her quintessence of torture? 'Twill be weal, Compared with aggregate of woe thy heart, Remorseless, wrung from millions whose appeal To right was vain!—millions of sires whose part Of woe though first, was least: they left an after-smart! 81 “For whom? For millions of their starveling sons And famished daughters, who still pine and moil By law: mere skin-and-bone automatons! Oh, serpent!—how my spirit's tide doth boil Against such viperousness as thine! The coil Of mortal life is mine no more:—I would It were—but for one day! How would I toil To lave my hands in some such viper's blood,— And purge my mountain sin—by spilling the vile flood! 82 “What breathe ye for, on earth,—such slime-born things? To suck your brethren's blood; and, while ye gorge, Mock your poor victims! Thy dark revellings In human blood and human tears their verge Have reached;—but, how it swells—the ocean surge Of tears and blood—thou and thy teacher drew— A fresh-born stream—from anguished hearts! 'Twould purge Cain's sin and mine,—with patriot brand to hew Into one heart like thine a festive avenue! 83 “Hah! how they shouted while thy mangled clay Was borne unto its burial!—the few men Whom blood of their old fathers, for one day, Stirred into more than slaves! Oh! it was then— While terror quelled even the iron ken Of thy stern fellow-lizard, who his claw Held up, and breathed an idiot ‘hush’—'twas then Thy waking victims should have filled Death's maw With the whole vermin brood that human vitals gnaw! 84 “Thou—‘also, to His Providence wilt trust!’ A hypocrite thou wert, in life; in death A coward: thou art both, in Hell! Thy gust For meanest vice fled not with flight of breath: Thy soul, escaped from out her pampered sheath, Yet hugs her stain! What wonder,—though the Guelph Oft spat upon thee,—that thou, still, the path Didst keep of fawning? Meanest, vilest elf, That ever played the tyrant,—loath thy abortive self!—” 85 “‘Shall I from thee receive this foul rebuke?”— Re-spake the soul-stung, fallen sycophant; “Tamely, fierce gibe and dark contumely brook From one whom all men deem a miscreant,— An outcast vile,—and not hurl back each taunt, Each withering sneer, wherewith thou seekst to gall My wound? Were my whole essence adamant The soul would strive herself to disenthral From force of gibes so fiercely, foully cynical. 86 “From thine own mouth I will thy heart convict Of its inherent vileness. Thou hast striven With unrelenting malice to afflict My soul; and thy foul game hath foully thriven, Chiefly by sarcasms 'gainst the prince now riven From all lust linked him with above the grave. Suppose thy censure forceful: grant him given A living prey to his heart's vice—a slave To filth so abject that the worms, which now their brave 87 “Carousal hold amidst his putrid clay, Find him not more uncleanly than in life; Grant that his kingly course affords no trait Of nobleness: that selfishness was rife As lust within him: that his soul a strife Perpetual showed the trampled human crowd To bruise more vilely still: that while the knife Was at their very throats his scoffs were loud, And he could see them bleed and die,—unmoved, unbowed: 88 “Grant that he thirsted but for power to wring From out his subjects' hearts the last life-drop— If it would minister to his revelling One guilty hour: grant that a sot, a fop, He was by turns: a blackleg, then—to groupe Of swindlers fugleman!—becoming, soon, The god of earthly gauds, and to the top Of his vain bent fooled on, by each baboon, Tinselled with titles, that beheld the holy spoon 89 “Bestow its unctuous virtue on his head, And laughed to see the gew-gaw placed thereon,— The grown child's gew-gaw!—while, in pomp outspread, Peers, prostitutes, pimps, prelates, round his throne Knelt blasphemously homaging the o'ergrown Monster of vice,—their grandeur fed, the while, With tears of starving thousands! Grant this known,— And then,—poor, silly Jew!—I can but smile To hear thee thus my fallen soul taunt and revile! 90 “For, if the royal Guelph my mirror were— Iscariot! who was thine? Hah! how thine eye Bespeaks thy heart's deep shame! Thy exemplar How worshipful, how holy, and how high In excellence! His beams to purify Thy baseness did that sun of goodness pour Upon thee; but thy sin was of a dye Too deep-grained—and thy heart within its core, Worshipped an earthen god, and there his image wore. 91 “And thus it was in vain that to thy eyes, Within thy ears, His deeds and words of love Were present day by day. Anatomize Thy heart, and thou wilt find that stain enwove, Entextured there, even now! Yea, did here move The Blessed One before thee clad in light And loveliness, the vision would not prove Sufficient to o'erawe thee, if to sight The silver bait were offered: that thou could'st not slight 92 “Thou art accurst, and justly. Vile and low Were thy desires through life: a groveller base Thou ever wert, and vainly from Hell's woe Thou dreamst to be set free. Hell's thy own place, Mean barterer! Unless thou canst erase From out thy sordid nature the low vice Of avarice, dream thou no more of grace! Before thou sittst in Jesu's Paradise, Satan shall, re-enthroned in highest heaven rejoice! 93 “How can it be, vile Traitor to the Blest! That after-knowledge by thy sinful soul Of God's foreknowledge can of guilt divest Thy mind? His knowledge did not thee control Before thy act: it was thy treachery foul,— Thy itch for petty pelf,—base, sordid thing!— That spiritual leprosy,—which daily stole Through thy foul heart, until its very spring Was tainted, and thou fledd'st to bloody bartering! 94 “Proclaimed He not thy treason while it germed Within thy heart shut up? yea, ere a word Forth budding from the hell-sown seed confirmed Thy foul intent? Perditioned, curst, abhorred, Thou wast, before thy mother's womb was stored With embryon of thy being. And 'twas decreed Of the Most High—witness His own record!— That thou shouldst breathe solely to do that deed, And on thy traitorous soul the undying worm should feed!”— 95 He spake no more; for speechless horror filled His soul to witness how the tortured ghost Of Judas writhed with rage,—and in what wild Distorted folds the scaly monsters tossed Their horrid hugeness,—with the Traitor lost A mystic sympathy evincing! Hell Seemed Hell indeed, while I upon that coast Beheld those snakes round Judas coil and swell, As if to wilder rage his soul they would impel! 96 I trembled as I gazed. But, as I dreamed, A wondrous change swift o'er my vision came. No more the serpents writhed: no more outgleamed From the Jew's eyes a wild demoniac flame: Calm and subdued, mingling with conscious shame A look of dignity, awhile he stood; And, when he speech resumed, how deep the blame His deed deserved—his treason 'gainst the Good— Acknowledged;—and, forthwith, a mystic theme pursued. 97 “More, far more than thou say'st, is mine, of guilt,”— He said: —“Deeper, far deeper, is my stain! “Not that I count it thus because they spilt The blood of Him I sold: they would have ta'en His precious life had no vile thought of gain E'er prompted me, or others, to betray The Blessed One. What can the wolf restrain From the meek lamb?—the vulture from his prey?— How shall the Good have peace, when Wickedness bears sway? 98 “Who that e'er dared to mock the tyrant's gaud,— The hypocrite's deceit,—could hope escape From Tyranny, and Avarice, and Fraud?— The demon-trinity knaves still bedrape With pomp and sanctity, till slaves, agape And palsied, see them wolve and victimise The best of human kind,—yea, tamely shape Their coward tongues to praise, when they should rise And hurl to dust the things of pride, and greed, and lies! 99 “My stain is deeper than thou knowst to tell. Not that I count it thus because I sought For glittering dust His precious life to sell: My poverty begat in me that thought, When I discerned the toils had nearly raught Their aim who laid them for his life. False one! My spirit's crime thou foully dost misquote: The vision deep within no longer shun: Behold thy soul with tide of pelfish love o'errun! 100 “A sordid thing—thou saidst I was! Is toy More precious to a child, than gaudy sheen Of baubles was to thee? Wert thou e'er coy Of silver as the price of blood? With mien Repentant didst thou restitute, and clean Confession make—before thy weasand-stroke, As I—before my rope? Wert thou not keen Of gold and power until thy clutch was broke With o'erstrained struggles to increase thy country's yoke? 101 “Oh! I might limn thy worthless effigy,— And with a truthful power, until thy heart Were rung to its vile core with agony! But the strong tempest leaves me: and the smart Wherewith thy soul would writhe would but impart A kindred woe to mine. A sordid thing!— Saidst thou, I was? Oh how old thoughts upstart At that tyrannic taunt!—old thoughts that wring My soul until they well-nigh back the tempest bring! 102 “Hah! tortured torturer!—while they moil unfed, If poor men sink in vice; if, 'midst their toil, So ill-requited, grovelling thoughts are bred In Labour's children; if the uncultured soil Of their neglected minds base weeds defile,— Whose is the crime? The trampled toilers'? or Their lordlings'?—who, while they, as thou, revile And taunt the trampled ones, trample them more; And hug, themselves, the vice they charge their slaves to abhor! 103 “A groveller if I was, charge thine own tribe— The titled plunderers—with the guilt! or make Them share the censure with the knavish Scribe And canting Pharisee! Each did partake The spoils of my hard toil upon the lake; But, while they feasted, left me to misfare With hunger, cold, and tempest, or the ache Of oft-impending death: disdaining care Whether I did the brute's or human nature wear! 104 “Unto their Judge I leave them! He will mete Their sentence with the measure just, of woe, As now He measures thine. Forbear deceit, Henceforth: thy guilt, in making grovellers low, Exceeds my guilt in grovelling. Lowly bow In shame, till it be interpenetrant Through all thy crimeful soul. My stain, I know, Is deep; no more of guiltlessness I vaunt: That boast were vain for Hell's self-exiled habitant. 105 “Ay, 'twas the sun of goodness on me shone: Goodness unmeasured, undescribed, untold: Goodness that strove its godlike benison To pour, alike, upon the ingrate cold As on the hearts its mercies manifold Made dance with thankfulness: Goodness unfelt, Unwitnessed, unconceived, in mortal mould, Before: Goodness that from its treasure dealt So bounteously, as if it would the wide world melt 106 “Into a sea of bliss, and deluge heart Of man with joy! Goodness that wept with those Whom grief constrained to weep: Goodness the smart In human bosoms torn by earthly throes That strove to medicate with love; to close The spirit's wounds with tenderness; and heal The mind bruised with the burthen of Life's woes Goodness that glowed with inexhaustless zeal To spread, enhance, perfect, eternize human weal! 107 “And I, amidst His radiance of love, Was dark and frozen still! Curst be my doom To all eternity! Never above May I behold that slighted One! My gloom The heavenly beam of mercy failed to illume On earth; and I deserve not now to find The love I slighted then. If, to consume My soul, Hell's stores of torments were combined— Too lightly, even then, had Heaven my curse assigned. 108 “Ten thousand hells hath merited—my sin Against Ineffable Goodness!—How I rave Amid my madness! Remedy akin To the disease were tortures that deprave Still more the spiritual health: in torment's wave Were the soul steeped for ever, her guilt's grain Would only be more fixed: who scourge the slave On earth, but nurture, by his galling pain, The rebel will they would by chastisement restrain. 109 “Great Judge of men and angels, 'tis not thus Thou governest! though I, i' the Hell I sought, Like fools on earth, such censure libellous Have oft pronounced upon thy rule, and thought My folly wisdom! Human crime is caught In fatal net of its own consequence: Afflict Thou dost not: though our minds, mistaught, Oft represent Thy vast omnipotence Bending to scourge poor worms for waywardness prepense! 110 “For waywardness that in the dust to crawl Inclines, beyond the track Thy wisdom hath Appointed! Spirit, though Hell's shades enthral Our essence, we are not of vengeful wrath The victims,—but have found, by self-made path, The suffering we pursued—of choice: not force. Evil, remedial of itself,—by death, Pain, suffering, grief, repentance, shame, remorse,— God hath appointed: Evil breathes not endless curse. 111 “Evil, for means of richest, greatest good The uncontrolled Controller hath devised: Such His peculiar scheme. O what a flood Of beatific light hath now baptized Me! All Life's discord shall be harmonised— For Woe, throughout all Life, shall be destroyed. Goodness Ineffable disnaturalised Would be,—Jehovah's Deity be void, — Unless from pain His universe were purified. 112 “Spirit,—rejoice, even though the gnawing worm Enter thine inmost essence, and pain pierce Thy being to the core! Maugre this storm Of torture, we shall reach repose: this fierce Consuming woe shall end; the Universe Shall be, through endless ages, resonant With voices tuned by joy: Love shall rehearse The Maker's wisdom, and His creatures chaunt, Blissful, the everlasting chorus jubilant! 113 “Why,—how I rave again”—with visage changed The spirit called of old ‘Perdition's Son’ Exclaimed:—“Is not my tortured soul estranged “From happiness? Do I not hate mine own Existence?—for annihilation groan,— And hate all that partake this life unblest? Leave me, foul sprite, to my despair alone! Dost thou not know that sceptred ghosts make quest For fawning things that will their robbers' right attest? 114 “Such errand to my cavern, late, did bring Old gray Achitophel—the cast-off tool Of royalty, who, still, like thee, doth cling To tyrants, though they spurn him. Kingly rule Grows problematical: on earth, the dull Tame slaves of toil sullenly fold their hands, Dreaming to starve their lords: Hell's self is full Of rebel thoughts 'gainst Thrones: brood of brigands Quake 'mid their pictured pomps: their dread thy zeal demands. 115 “Haste, minion, to recruit the minished host Of their defenders—thou who didst so well Subserve their pride on earth! Never more boast Of boundless loyalty, if thus rebel Thy fears 'gainst duty, till resolve they quell. Hah! pangs of shame thy spirit paralyse! Thy dread is just—Outcast of earth and hell! Hell's Thrones, to scout thee, would indignant rise, Did they thy craven guilt-smit image recognise! 116 “Base spawn of fear and guilt,—get hence, and cage Thy lunacy in some dark desert nook Where none may hear thee curse, and spume, and rage— For curse thou shalt!—Hence!—and again invoke The Radiant Boy!”— My soul such terror shook While Judas raged, and from the snake-cave fled, Shrieking, Cray's suicide,—that I awoke, Gladly, from that soul-quelling dream of dread, And, joyous, blessed the morn, upon my prison-bed. BOOK THE FOURTH. 1 Welcome, sweet Robin! welcome, cheerful one! Why dost thou slight the merry fields of corn, The sounds of human joy, the plenty strown From Autumn's teeming lap; and, by gray morn, Ere the sun wakes, sing thus to things of scorn And infamy and want and sadness whom Their stronger fellow-criminals have torn From freedom and the gladsome light of home, To quench the nobler spark within, in dungeoned gloom? 2 Why dost thou choose, throughout the live-long day, A prison-rampart for thy perch, and sing As thou wouldst rend thy fragile throat? Away, My little friend, away, upon light wing, A while! Me it will cheer, imagining Till thou revisit this my drear sojourn, How, on the margent of some silver spring Mantled with golden lilies, thou dost turn Thy pretty head awry, so meaningly, and yearn, 3 From out that beaming look, to know what thoughts Within the beauteous arrow-head may dwell— The purple eye petalled with snow, that floats So gracefully. Dost think the damosel, Young Hope, kirtled with Chastity, there fell Into the stream, and grew a flower so fair? Ah! still thou lingerest, while I, dreaming, tell Of pleasures I would reap, if free I were, Like thee, loved bird, to breathe sweet Freedom's balmy air. 4 Away!—for this is not a clime for thee— Sweet childhood's sacred one! The hawthorns bend With ruddy fruitage: tiny troops, with glee Plundering the mellow wealth, a shout will send Aloft, if they behold their feathered friend, Loved ‘Robin Redbreast,’ mingle with their joy! Did they not watch thy tenderlings, and wend With eager steps, when school was o'er, a coy And wistful peep to take—lest some rude ruffian boy, 5 With sacrilegious heart and hand, should rob Thy nest as heathenly as if ‘Heaven's bird’ Were not more sacred than the vulgar mob Of pies and crows? Flee,—loved one!—thou hast heard This dissonance of bolts and bars that gird Old England's modern slaves, until thy sense Of freedom's music will be sepulchred. Hie where young hearts gush taintless joy intense, And, 'mid their rapture, pour thy heart's mellifluence! 6 Still lingerest thou upon that dreary wall Which bars, so enviously, my view of grove And stream and hill, as if it were death's pall? Oh leave this tyrant-hold, and, joyous, rove— Loved bird of home—bird of our father's love— Where the thatched cottage, clad with virgin rose And sweet-briar and rosemary, thickly wove Among vine-leaves, with nectar-garland woos The amorous bees that, songful, do their love-sweets spouse. 7 Hasten, dear Robin!—for the aged dame Calls thee to gather up the honeyed crumb She scatters at her door; and, at thy name, The youngsters crowd to see their favourite come. Fear not Grimalkin!—she doth sing ‘three-thrum,’ With happy half-shut eyes, upon the warm Soft cushion in the corner-chair: deaf, dumb, And toothless lies old Growler:—fear no harm, Loved Robin!—thou shalt banquet hold without alarm. 8 Ah! Chanticleer hath eyed the dainties spread For thee, and summons his pert train the prize To share. Lo! how the children ask with dread, Of the old grandame with the glazëd eyes, ‘Why Robin does not come?’ The pet one cries, Because he sees thee not,—unpacified, Even with the apple tinct with vermeil dyes, The first-born offers with a kiss! Abide Not here, expected one, lest woe the cot betide! 9 If thou return not, Gammer o'er her pail Will sing in sorrow, 'neath the brinded cow, And Gaffer sigh over his nut-brown ale; While evermore the petlings, with sad brow, Will look for thee upon the holly bough, Where thou didst chirp thy signal note, ere on The lowly grunsel thou didst light, and show, With such sweet confidence,—thou darling one!— Thy blythesome face,—and, on thee, all cried ‘benison!’ 10 Alas!—I mind me why thou lingerest here! My country's happy cottages abound No longer. Where they stood and smiled, uprear The ‘Bastile’ and the gaol!—and thou hast found Such refuge, Robin, as,—upon the ground Where Alfred reigned, and Hampden fought and bled, Where Milton sung, and Latimer was crowned With glorious martyrdom,—is portionëd Unto our fathers' sons, who win with tears their bread. 11 Bread!—nay devour with greed the grovelling root, As recompense of labour for their lords; Or, spurned, when begging to have, like the brute, Fodder for toil, and coerced into hordes Of midnight spoilers, swell the black records Of cruelty and crime. ‘This dear, dear land’ Dying speech of Gaunt.—Shakspeare. Rich. II., Act 2. Is dear no longer: its great name affords Thoughts but for curses! Ay, where the brave band Sang in the flames—lit by the brood of Hildebrand; 12 Where strode the iron men of Runnymede, And quelled the tyrant; where burns memory How lawless Falseness, sprung of royal seed And sceptred, paid stern forfeit by decree Of broad-day justice unto Liberty; Where noblest deeds were done; upon this isle— ‘This precious stone set in the silver sea’ Dying speech of Gaunt.—Shakspeare, Rich. II., Act 2. Men talk of England as of something vile; And wish they could forget her, in some far exile! 13 The cottage babes were mourning, did I say, For that the threshold their loved visitant Presented not? Alas, poor bird! Thy lay And all its sweetness is forgot: their want Of bread hath banished thoughts of Robin's chaunt: The children plenty know no more; and Love And Gentleness have fled from Hunger's haunt: Fled is all worship for fair things that rove Among fair flowers—worship in young hearts sweetly wove. 14 Fair Nature charms not: fellowship with song And beauty,—germs from which grow, for the good Deep reverence, and for the frail, though wrong, Pity and tenderness:—all these, the rude Chill breath of Want hath stifled in the bud; And beggar-quarrels for their scanty crust Now fill the bosoms of the lean, dwarfed brood, The peasant father—sprung from sires robust— Beholds at home, and wishes he were laid in dust! 15 Ah! darling Robin, thou wilt soon behold No homes for poor men on old England's shore: No homes but the vile gaol, or viler fold Reared by new rule to herd the ‘surplus poor’— Wise rule which unto Pauperism's foul core— The rich man's purse-plague's core—shall penetrate: Paupers shall multiply their race no more Except they live in palaces! Debate Upon the rule they may: but,—the slaves bear their fate! 16 Slaves,—abject, bloodless, soulless, sneaking slaves! Your fetters are perfected, now! Tug, strain, Toil, sweat, and starve, and die! For, whoso raves For larger pittance from his lords humane,— Or, malcontent, dares from hard toil refrain,— He shall be Bastiled! His wise lords say well— Such grumbling slaves might nurture bold disdain In their serf-offspring: better 'tis to quell, At once, and, in the germ, creatures that might rebel! 17 Cowards,—why did ye suffer knaves to forge These eunuch-fetters?—why so tamely don These chains?— Beshrew this rising in my gorge To think that others 'neath their fetters groan, And do not break them!—Wear I not my own? Ay, and must wear them, while my tyrants choose. Well: let me bide my time; and, then, atone For that real crime—the failing to arouse Slaves against tyrants. I may, yet, before life's close.— 18 The sun has faded. Robin, 'tis full time Thou fleddst to covert: cease thy song, and hie Away to rest!—but let me hear thy chime Renewed to-morrow; for home's minstrelsy Is precious 'mid these bars. Robin, good-bye! 'Twas Childhood's farewell; and I cannot yield This heart to bitterness so utterly, But that the sense of fondness, now upsealed Therein, will struggle till its pulses be revealed. 19 Once more resounds the hateful clank of bars And bolts: once more I gain my narrow lair. Of bondage-life new-fangledness ne'er mars The drear perfection: Morrow is the heir Legitimate of dull To-day; and where Yesterday gazed upon the chill damp wall And yawned, To-day looks on with the same air Of listlessness. Food, sight, sound, converse pall: Only the fountains of the dead well spiritual 20 Waters that purify the stagnant mind From morbid loathings that would madness breed, Amid this sickening slough of unrefined And vulgar circumstance.— My spirit, freed From matter, seemed on enterprise to speed, Once more, across Death's gloomful ocean wave; And raught the shore where penance is decreed To souls forsaking, with presumption brave, Their clay ere Nature's sentence lays it in the grave: 21 The sculptured aisle—the dome—were quickly gained, And past. And now, a feeling and a sense, Or, what were likest sense and feeling, reigned Throughout my being of a power intense To summon up the soul's experience, And view, as in a mirror, her whole course Of consciousness: filled with this opulence Of intellective might, unto each source Of mortal joy the mind recurred, with mystic force. 22 Her reminiscence seemed so full and clear Of pleasures past, so consolably viewed She Life's young worships pure, that Hades' sphere Grew gladly bright, and the dread clime seemed hued Like vernal earth. Childhood's sweet fields renewed, With daisies and with king-cups gay begemmed, I saw: then Lindsey's sweetest sanctitude Of Druid woods arose, where, giant-stemmed, Upreared old trees anew with verdure diademmed. 23 Cirqued with his offspring stood the central oak Of myriad years, throwing each glorious bough Abroad as bravely as when music broke The solitudes while there his parent grew, And ‘derry-down!’ was sung, and mistletoe Was gathered by the bearded hierophant, And troops of primal men their eagled foe Fierce staggered, chased the bison to his haunt, And slew, in his own den, the wolf so grim and gaunt. 24 Along mazed paths beloved of those old trees I seemed to walk 'mong flowers all faëry-frail, Azure-robed harebells, chaste anemones, Primroses wan, and lilies of the vale, Each bud so beauteous that all speech would fail To say how lovely 'twas: for, gushing tears Of ecstasy can only tell the tale, Unto some kindred heart that Nature cheers As rapturously, how fair are flowers of childhood's years! 25 And melody awoke of sweet wood-lark And mellow-throated blackbird; whispering thrill Of thousand tiny things, each like a spark Of gold or emerald, o'er pool and rill, Amid the noonbeam sporting; coo and bill, And love's soft throbbings by the stockdove coy; Mingled with minstrelsy of throstles shrill;— Blent sylvan harmonies with flood of joy Seeming the heart to deluge, and its sense o'ercloy! 26 And still the land was Hades, and the soul Lived consciously discerpt from her clay shrine, And viewed through plenitude of her control Over the past, in mirror crystalline, Life's joys; nay, seemed her essence to entwine With them until again she lived them o'er.— The harping of an unseen hand divine Now carols woke of courtly troubadour, Till the old forest echoed with proud songs of yore. 27 Lays that with fluttering bosom many a maid Of southern clime oft listed from some high And envious turret,—rapturous serenade Of glowing love, mingled with bitter sigh And passionate upbraiding, breathed to die Upon the breeze. Anon a strain upsent That unseen harp, shrill as when cleaves the sky The battle-trumpet: gorgeous tournament The harper sang, and shock of knights armipotent: 28 Of prancing steeds, and terrible mêlée, And dancing plumes, he told: of high proclaim By pageant herald; victor-garland gay Bestowed with peerless blush of maiden shame, Revealing peerless maiden's conscious flame; Of honours by spectator kings conferred; And royal mandate that the conqueror's fame Be borne through Christendom,—yea, to the beard Of the swart Soldan, 'mid his sweltering turbanned herd; 29 A stately burthen, couched in antique tongue And magic rhyme, unto his mystic shell With tuneful voice, the unseen minstrel sung. But suddenly, his lofty harpings fell To dirge-like melody; for smit by spell Of memory dread, the bard his heartless foil On earth, and breath of hope hushed by the knell Of early death, sung sadly. Dull recoil His harp seized, next, as if it shrunk from overtoil. 30 The sorrow-broken songster, soon, to wake Its chords in wailful cavatina strove: He sung of the proud, slighted bosom's ache, Of soul-consuming fires more fierce than love Or jealousy, of restless hopes that move Their young possessor to aspirings wild, Of disappointment's gall when frowns disprove His smiling day-dreams, till the draught defiled— The deathly chalice—tempts the scorn-stung Poet-child! 31 Sobbings, that heaved as they would rend the heart, Succeeded, and the lyre was dumb! Then passed The shade of fated Chatterton athwart My path,—sad, mournful, slow, with eyes downcast, And visage ye might emblem by a waste Of over-prurience, or tropic field Where luscious fruitage springing thick and fast Expires of hasty ripeness, ere can yield To the taste its sweets, or their rich value be revealed.— 32 The shade evanished from my eager gaze,— Seeking, with haste of heart-galled misanthrope, Some dark secluded nook of forest-maze. And, now, came o'er my spirit a grim troop Of self-accusing thoughts, swift summoned up By Memory, who, again, with mystic might Seemed high endowed. How oft, in youth, the dupe I, also, was, of dreams,—and misused flight Of years,—she sternly pictured to my humbled sight. 33 To manhood, reached before the dreams of youth Were half relinquished, passed my bodiless Essence, and seemed to sigh, where oft, in truth, The waking heart had sighed, deep blamefulness Of indolence beholding, pride's excess,— And thousand errors although inly mourned Still followed. Then a love-look of distress Was pictured, telling how one bosom yearned To bless me, as if still the soul on earth sojourned.— 34 Anon a change came o'er my dream. Disposed In stately length, a twilight avenue Of trees funebrous suddenly disclosed I saw,—where the tall cypress, ancient yew, Dark pine, and spreading cedar, as by due Observance of nice art, like colonnade Of desert Tadmor, were arranged, and grew A solemn vista clothed with musing shade— Such as the rapt soul's holiest retrospect might aid. 35 A monumental form, that meekly glowed With softest radiance, sadly o'er an urn Sepulchral, 'neath a lofty cypress, bowed, Midway, along this sombrous pathway. Lorn It drooped, and, voiceless, seemed to tell ‘I mourn ‘With more than mortal grief;’ yet, was such grace Celestial by that drooping statue worn, That one desired for ever in that place To stay and gaze upon its spiritual face. 36 Enrapt to ecstasy, I gazed till life Began to fill its breast, and passion shone Through its unmarbled eyes! Death a vain strife Essayed, with chilly grasp around her zone, To hold in sculptured grief that ardent one. Lo! high, immortal Love breathed vital power On her fair limbs, and, with a gentle moan, She raised her head—a monument no more Of sorrow—but, for love, a peerless cynosure! 37 Her islet shell the burning Lesbian took From sad repose upon the urn that feigned To hold the image of her grief, and strook The matchless chords as one who pain disdained: Then, proudly, though with tears, she thus complained Of slighted tenderness,—vowing to feed Her fruitless flame till, spirit disenchained From torture, her deep constancy its meed Should find in some blest state for souls by gods decreed:— 38 “Phaon! beloved, unloving Phaon! thee The maid enamoured hymns,—by pain unchanged In Hades, as by scorn on earth: on me Let angry Jove, the Torturer, be avenged For slighted life, and order disarranged Of his stern government: woe shall not wrest Thy image from its throne: never estranged Shall be her love from Sappho's faithful breast: She can love on—unloved, despised, ache-doomed, unblest! 39 “Ingrate! I offered thee no vulgar toy, No mindless, soulless prize: hadst thou my flame Returned, the passion of a thoughtless boy, Compared with mine, were like the lustre tame Of night's pale worm shown to the sun-lit gem. Cold, undiscerning clay,—thou wast not worth My love! Alas! each winged reproach I aim At thee back on my soul recoils with birth Of fond remorse more torturous, far, than woes of earth. 40 “Phaon beloved! unloving though thou wert, My love burns on, and shall all pain survive— A deathless flame: my soul lives all-amort By her own nature, since she doth derive Her essence from intenseness, nor can live An atom of her life in meek, cold, calm Indifference. Mystic hopes that in me strive For utterance!—do ye truly shape the palm I claim, or doth sick Fancy feign the spirit's balm? 41 “Fidelity to Nature's impulses Shall bring, at length, ineffable reward: They who, all unsubdued, 'gainst miseries Of scorn and death have waged the combat hard Shall meet their guerdon; dreams of gifted bard And visions of gray seer shall be fulfilled: Torture, that long the universe hath marred, Shall end: of Love and Hate the life-war wild Shall cease: the discords of the soul for aye be stilled. 42 “It cannot be that with the Beautiful Deformity shall ever, envious, blend: Mercy divine shall demon Wrath annul, Love conquer Hate, and glorious Goodness bend Her iris over life till she transcend The power of Evil, and annihilate Its sting for ever!”— “Ardent Lesbian, end Thy dreams, nor dare Futurity and Fate To fix, by thy fond wish, in fancied happy state!”— 43 Thus broke upon my spirit accents stern, Haughty, abrupt; and, forthwith, stood beside Sappho's soft form a spirit cold and dern Of aspect, but whose stately, seemly pride Outspoke the tuneful Roman suicide Who wooed the Muse to leave her wonted hill, And tread the plain with philosophic stride,— And, slighting toys, with manly themes to fill The soul—of its own Liberty, Fate, Good, and Ill. In an age when all metaphysical poetry is deemed dull and stupid, it would not be easy to create a popular curiosity respecting the contents of the superb poem on “The Nature of Things,” by Lucretius. Readers of the Latin classics usually regard it as valuable, chiefly for its masterly embodiment of the principles of the Epicurean philosophy; but Dr. Mason Good opens the preface to his version with this glowing, and more universal, eulogy of the Roman philosopher-poet:— “There is no poem within the circle of the ancient classics, more entitled to attention than 'The Nature of Things, 'by Titus Lueretius Carus. It unfolds to us the rudiments of that philosophy, which, under the plastic hands of Gassendi and Newton, has, at length, obtained an eternal triumph over every other hypothesis of the Grecian schools; it is composed in language the most captivating and perspicuous that can result from an equal combination of simplicity and polish, is adorned with episodes the most elegant and impressive, and illustrated by all the treasures of natural history. It is the Pierian spring from which Virgil drew his happiest draughts of inspiration; and constitutes, in point of time, as of excellence, the first didactic poem of antiquity.” 44 “Dispel these sanguine dreams!”—the proud bard said: “Passion,—warm maid,—hath seized the heritance Of Reason in thee: proof hath Nature spread That strong Necessity rules wide expanse Of Universe: primeval atoms Chance May have assorted; but, once joined, 'tis vain To dream a separation. Partial glance On Nature renders thy warm essence fain To witness unmixed Good begin its ceaseless reign: 45 “But, know, the Universe is perfect, since Eternal destiny forbade all germs Diverse from what exist. Let it convince Short-sighted murmurers at the mingled swarms Of being, that all which is—is best, though storms And darkness, death and havoc, mix with peace And radiance, life and love; since each conforms To high Necessity. Let passion cease, Lesbian, to dazzle thee with fraudful garishness.”— 46 So spake Lucretius; but, with look undimmed Of intellectual ardour, Sappho thus Renewed her yearning thought:— “Guesses sublimed “By doubt, rather than argument abstruse And wise, thou utterest, O incredulous Epicurean! Failing to foreknow The future, and with haste incurious Glancing at past and present, thou art slow To mark how Nature doth her bright intents foreshow. 47 “Weakly, not wisely, Mind doth refuge take In greater mystery from the less: though faith In government of kindly gods forsake The soul full oft, beholding pain and death Of fairest things endowed with lease of breath,— Yet seems it blind procedure to conclude Our puzzled survey with a word that saith The gods are helpless as ourselves, and feud Of Good with Evil hath by law of Fate ensued: 48 “Fate, or Necessity: Bard, what is this But Ignorance veiled in simulance of words? Nature's strange strife must be—because it is; Or, is—because it must be: dull discords Of reason! If its help, indeed, affords No sager explications of the cause Of things, sterile its rules my soul regards, And cleaves to Phantasy, from which she draws Faith more ennobling to interpret Nature's laws. 49 “The soul loathes Pain, Deformity, Decay: Nature hath made them loathsome to her sense: Therefore, they shall not always be. Bard, say, What proves this truthless? Wordy eloquence Of doubt compriseth all the proof from whence Thou dost affirm Necessity; and why Should spirits slight the cheering evidence Of their own sympathies with Nature's high Proclaim, to embrace clouds of dull dubiety?”— 50 The sanguine Lesbian ceased; and thus replied The philosophic bard:— “Couldst thou efface “My doubts,—rapt, tuneful one,—to list thee chide With this sweet earnestness and winning grace I entreat the reader to understand these phrases as an ascription to Sappho's real power as a poetess,—not as characteristic of the manner in which I have made her apparition discourse. Ancient and modern critics without number—Longinus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Horace himself, Vossius, Hoffman, Addison, &amp;c. &amp;c., have paid the highest tribute to the poetical excellence of the fair suicide of Lesbos; but, perhaps, a more finished and eloquent eulogy on her lyric worth is not to be found in the compass of a few words, than in the following extract from the ninth volume of the Encyclopœdia Metropolitana:— “There are few intellectual treasures, the loss of which is more deeply to be regretted than that of the works of this poetess; for the remnants which have reached us certainly display genius of the highest order; they are rich even to exuberance, and yet directed by the most exquisite taste. In these most delicious of love-songs the tide of passion seems deep and exhaustless; it flows rapidly yet gently on, while the most sparkling fancy is ever playing over it; and the words themselves seem to participate in the sentiments which they develope. It is a mistake to imagine that the fragments of Sappho are nothing more than the eloquent expressions of amatory feeling; they are really verses of high imagination, which renders them as beautiful as they are intense, and, in the opinion of some writers, raises them even to the sublime.” Long season would I yield. A resting-place My spirit yearns to find within the veil Of Truth—but yearns in vain. We still but chase Shadows, and evermore the substance fail To find, of Truth: our clearest light is mystical. 51 “Deformity and discord war with fair And lovely shapes throughout the universe: What wonder, then, if gifted spirits share This wishful trust—that Good shall Ill disperse Victorious, yet? I own, 'tis not through fierce Impetuous longing, but by true, innate Devotion to the Beautiful—to hearse All pain in joy—woe, wrong, to annihilate— Thy essence, Lesbian, builds this happy after-state: 52 “It is the native yearning of the Mind: The soul attuned to harmony and love Longs from the chains of discord to unbind All being that wears them. Yet, I view, enwove Through Nature, laws by which all things commove Despite our choice, misnamed,—or joy or woe Of sentient creatures: laws it doth behove Gods to conserve, lest fickle men below, Judging them null, should cease within their fanes to bow. 53 “Or, if uncaused the Universe exists— Mystery beyond the plummet of our thought!— Who, then, shall sperse the dark eternal mists That veil all being?—who break the irksome knot With which Necessity binds fast the lot Of every sensuous thing—exposed to death, And pain, and hate?—who cancel the huge blot Of suffering from all life? The shadow fleeth Of Truth! Spirits,—we wander in a mystic path! 54 “How know we whether it be fair and good And godlike to desire plenipotence Of love, whereby to pour a bounteous flood Upon the universe, and fill all sense And thought with joy, or, whether vehemence Of folly be the fitter name whereby To note our wish? Unknowing indigence— With all our toil—beggars the soul: we try In vain to grasp Truth's substance: all is phantasy! 55 “If it were fair and good to bless all thought And life with joy, why was not Nature clad In never-changing smiles from birth? why fraught For ages thus, her life with suffering sad, With pain and agony? Will Evil add, By mystic providence, unto the sum Of everlasting Good? What rapture glad Would fill the soul, what blest delirium Of joy, could she burst through the veil that hides her doom! 56 “But all is doubt, and dark: we struggle on Like limëd birds: still captive, but the strife Maintain, in trust that freedom shall be won. How vain may prove our trust! Spirits, what if Our ignorance have misnamed the hues of Life— Evil and Good? From whence, then, shall we earn Knowledge to unknow our strange errors? Rife With mystery all—ay, all appears; and yearn For ever, vainly, may the soul pure Truth to learn!”— 57 Lucretius ceased: and dark debate and doubt Brooded on brows of many an habitant Of that strange clime who now, in wondering rout, Listed the theme.— A spiritual pursuivant Or herald ghost, meanwhile, with ministrant Aspect approached; and him thus greet the crowd:— “Hail, bard who didst the world-waged victory chaunt Of Cæsar and Pharsalia! message-browed Thy visage seems: we listen: thy full thoughts unshroud!”— 58 “High-gifted spirits of self-exiled land,”— Replied the soul of Lucan;—“Minds, that erst On earth caught inspiration from the grand And beautiful in Nature, and conversed With her Divinity until she nursed Within ye thoughts and forms of glorious might And loveliness,—which in their fulness burst Upon the world suffusing Man with bright Ecstatic visions of the reign of Truth and Right,— 59 “I come with embassage from high divan Of spirits who on earth held sceptred sway Or civic honour. Deep debate began Their essences, of late, if throned-array And pomps, in Hades, ceaseless state pourtray Of monarchy on earth,—or phantoms build Their regal seats, and mythic shapes display Lessons of change, that dynasts unbeguiled May be of pride which hath, perchance, their souls defiled: 60 “Exalted Hellene spirits challenge proof Of natural kingship: while a haughty host Of Thrones contend, beneath cerulean roof, For ceaseless rule of princes. To their coast The court of sceptred suicides each ghost Inviteth of your king-souled lineage, That ye the quest may aid which long hath tossed Hades in doubt; and blissful heritage Of Truth spirits may win. Ye have my embassage.”— 61 “We come,—we come!”—with rapturous minstrelsy Of many a mystic harp the Poet-choir Respond:—‘we come to join the jubilee “Of thought! The true-born children of the lyre High emprise of the soul can never tire. To gauge the depths of doubt; the heights to scale Of phantasy; the strength of passion's fire To prove; to labour on, though footsteps fail Of Mind in Mystery's path; our essence shall not quail! 62 “To dare to think—our rightful attribute We claim. What though we vainly thread the maze Of thought? Ours be the banquet of dispute— The feast of argument. And if the ways Of dark Necessity still shun our gaze— Better in vain to search, than irk and pine In low ignoble sloth!”— Receding rays Shed the rapt choir. From Phantasy's confine Slowly crept back the soul unto her mortal shrine. BOOK THE FIFTH. 1 Hail, eldest Night! Mother of human fear! Vague solitude where infant Man first felt His native helplessness! Beneath whose drear And solemn coverture he, trembling, knelt To what in thy vast womb of darkness dwelt Unseen, unknown!—but, with the waking Sun, Shouting, sprang up to see glad Nature melt In smiles, triumphantly his Joy-God run Up the blue sky, and Light's bright reign again begun! 2 Hail, starless darkness!—Sterile silence, hail! Would that o'er Chaos thy wide rule had been Perpetual, and reptile Man's birth-wail Had ne'er been heard; or, over huge, obscene, And monstrous births of ocean or terrene For ever thou hadst brooded; so that Light Had ne'er mocked mortals, nor the morning sheen Broke thy stern sigil to give baleful sight To Man—whose look upon his fellow is a blight! 3 Season of sepulchred and secret sin! Beneath thy pall what vileness doth Man hide, From age to age,—the moral Harlequin Who dons the saint to play the fratricide. Villany's jubilee!—Crime's revel-tide!— Whose archives opened would yon judge proclaim More criminal than the thief he lately tried,— Yon priest an atheist,—and hold up to shame Myriads of knaves writ ‘honest’ in the roll of Fame! 4 Mute witness of frail beauty's primal wreck! Carnival hour of gray-haired Lechery!— Foul harvest-time of her who sits to beck O'er her cursed threshold yon boy-debauchee,— The bawd, all palsy-twitched, whose feignful glee, When he beholds her face upon the morrow, With sobered brain, will freeze his jollity To speechless horror, till he fain would borrow Thy veil, once more, to hide his young remorseful sorrow! 5 High noon of the adulterer, who doth ask Of yawning hell to triple thy black hour, That he, unshooned, may safely, 'neath thy mask, Reach the unfastened, guilt-frequented door, And steep his soul in sin unto the core! Mirth-bringer to the thief grown hunger-fell,— Who laughs to clutch the miser's coffered store, And, rendered shrewd by law, with smothered yell, Sends the rich shrivelled fool where he no tales can tell! 6 Thou great conspirator with men of blood To curtain murder till the guilty proof In some lone cave or unfrequented wood, From man's short-sighted vigilance aloof Can be earthed up! Oh! if the ebon woof Thou stretchest o'er the land could now be changed Into a mirror,—how the poor dupe's scoff Would burst upon his teachers seen estranged From rules they taught! How he would burn to be avenged! 7 At base pretensions unto comely worth, At foul Hypocrisy's true features shown, How would the universal curse burst forth!— Hah! how I doat! Am I an idiot grown In the dank dungeon? Is not the World known Unto Itself to be a stage of cheats, Where, whoso plays with skill, if he depone, Glibly, that each sworn brother-knave's deceits Are fair, the skilful knave a world-voiced plaudit greets? 8 And, were thy pall, dim Night, asunder torn, And ugliest portraits thou dost veil laid bare, For worship men would soon exchange their scorn. With flagrant front do not Day's vices glare, And men that they are virtues sleekly swear? Darkness! still hold thy provident control O'er half man's life, that some thy cloak may wear To sin with shame: more seemly 'tis than stole Of sanctity that hides, by day, the filthy soul. 9 Darkness! thy sceptre still maintain,—for thou Some scanty sleep to England's slaves dost bring: Leicester's starved stockingers their misery now Forget; and Manchester's pale tenderling- The famished factory—child—its suffering A while exchangeth for a pleasant dream!— Dream on, poor infant wretch! Mammon may wring From out thy tender heart, at the first gleam Of light, the life-drop, and exhaust its feeble stream! 10 Darkness! still rule—that the Lancastrian hive Of starveling slaves may bless thee: for even they, With all their wretchedness, desire to live!— Ay, men desire to live—to whom the day Will bring again their woman's-task—to stay At squalid home, and play the babe's meek nurse Till sound of factory-bell, when they away Must haste, and hold the suckling to life's source, Within the rails! Upon their tyrants be my curse! 11 Nay, rather light that curse on ye, yourselves, Ye timid, crouching crew! Is there no heart Among ye stung to see the puny elves, His children, daily die; his wife dispart Her hair, and glare in madness? Doth the smart Of slavery cease to rankle in your veins? Faint, though ye be, and feeble, will none start Unto his feet, and cry, while aught remains In him of life—‘Death! or deliverance from our chains’? 12 Cowards! do ye believe all men are like Yourselves?—that craven fear doth paralyse Each English arm until it dares not strike A tyrant?—that no voice could exorcise Old Tyler's spirit, and impel to rise Millions omnipotent in vengeful ire?— Fool, that I am!—are there not hungry spies On every hand, who watch, for dirty hire, Each glance of every eye that glows with Freedom's fire?— 13 Whoso bethinks him that the eager grasp Of foremost friendship's semblance may denote The deeper venom of the darkling asp, And that the multitude's applausive shout May be the prelude to their hate;—if doubt And hesitance arrest his fervid pulse, And cool it to consistence with due thought For his own offspring;—if their prattlings dulce Seduce him from resolves that do the soul convulse 14 With troubles, contests, perils myriadfold, And threatening prospect of a baleful end By the vile halter,—in the dungeon cold,— Or on the transport-shore without a friend To sympathise, but hordes of slaves to rend, Even in its death-pangs, the lorn exile's breast, With brutal taunts:—Oh! let him reprehend That knoweth none of these,—but here confest Shall stand my sentence,—while I am a dungeon-guest: 15 I reprehend him not, that wisely looks Before he leaps,—and looks again!— Poor slaves, Forgive that hasty curse—forgive! Rebukes From me ye little need, while the rude waves Of suffering overwhelm ye! Seek your graves In peace! for ye are hasting thitherward Apace. Why should ye a vain strife 'gainst knaves And tyrants struggle to maintain? Discard All torturous hope: Redemption's path for you is barred! 16 Drudge on in peace! Ay, though ye starve, still drudge, Lest from your fondlings ye be torn, to herd With eunuch-paupers! Tyrants wreck their grudge Not as of old: high lords then massacred The scurvy slaves who insolently dared To murmur: now they wisely take revenge On murmurers like men who have conferred With meek Philosophy; and mildly change Murder of breathing things for annihilation strange 17 Of things designed, as they believe, to breathe! And if they do not thus believe, they lie— The atheistic hypocrites! To sheathe The sword in ye were barbarous: ye shall die Humanely slow; and they will meekly try In peace to end ye! 'Tis the radiant dawn Of Christian Civilisation! Purify The earth they must by sweeping off your spawn— Even as the sun sweeps noxious vapours from the lawn! 18 Drudge on, in silent meekness! Tamely drag Life's fardels as ye may: 'twill soon be spent— This loan of breath; and they will find some rag To wrap ye in at last! When ye are blent With other churchyard things—from riches rent And pride—ye will be even with them! Pine A few more hours! Your goodly tenement, The grave, is near: that fair, serene confine Where ye will never hunger while your lordlings dine!— 19 Hark! 'tis Consumption's hollow cough that rings From yon damp felon-cell! How dread these vaults Of living Death seem 'mid such echoings At midnight! What strange doubt the soul assaults,— What frightful boding! till the heart's pulse halts, As if it were afraid to beat so loud!— Let me to rest! To-morrow, when the bolts Are drawn, once more, this feeling of the shroud May flee: the spirit be, again, with hope endowed: 20 With hope for Man's redemption: though a crime It is for prison-thralls of such a hope To breathe!— I slept, and saw, again, the clime Of suicidal souls. One of a troop Of travellers newly come, beneath the cope Sepulchral of the vague, vast, caverned span I stood. Anon, adown an aisle whose slope Invited, on new travel, I began To wend, forth from that region subterranean. 21 Upon a bleak and barren plain, I dreamed That I emerged, where one tall pillar reared Its height until among the clouds it seemed To end. Yet, 'twas but mockery when I neared This lofty wonder—for its top appeared Beneath man's stature. Low, around the base, Lay broken sculptures of great names revered In times of old; but ruin did deface Them till they looked like Memory in her burial-place. 22 And then another, and another stone Uprose, in the far distance,—each the aim Vain-glorious of its founders making known More by its wreck than record of the name Or deed it had been stablished to proclaim. Food for despondence, thus, the brooding mind Gathered with semblant shapes that fleeting came Athwart its vision: for, as flits the wind, These imaged columns fled, or with new forms combined. 23 In allegoric lessons for the soul— Of Liberty, each marble fragment strewed Upon that plain, each pictured deed and scroll, Told, as it lay, and I the ruin viewed: ‘She is a goddess Man hath oft pursued,— ‘Won seldom,—and hath never yet retained ‘Her living presence!’ Dreary solitude O'er all I saw in saddened vision reigned, Until a verdant mound my anxious spirit gained. 24 And, on the mound, methought, a mystic cirque Of giant stones in simple grandeur rose, Resembling Earth's first fathers' handy-work— Their temples, or their tombs. Of Freedom's cause, When Gallia's sons bound laurel on their brows Blent with the oak, full many a devotee,— Self-exiled from the wrath of friends grown foes,— 'Mid that cairn's shadow seated seemed to be, Deep brooding on the Past: a stern confederacy. 25 Unapprehensible unto their thought My being seemed, as I the cirque surveyed: Albeit, so veritably that I mote Not doubt, sat there each patriotic Shade Revealed. Their spiritual brows arrayed In light unearthly seemed; and, soon, to tell His thoughts each form began, while Spirit made Response to Spirit: waking not the swell Of sounds, but voiceless, Mind to Mind seemed voluble.— 26 “How long shall poor Humanity lie waste On earth!”—began this mystic utterance Buzot,—of La Gironde's great sons not last In toil to break the feudal bonds of France: “How long will Liberty make tarriance, Nor haste to bless our race! Brothers, I deem Our agony in this strange heritance Of after-life a far less rueful theme Than thought that Tyranny on earth is still supreme. 27 “Of suffering here I reck not; since from earth Come spirits hither still, that each declare Our ancient home enslaved. Who would have mirth In after-life while Earth's poor children wear The fetters of the despot, and despair To break them? This is woe,—this, this,—to feel That all in vain we broke the priestly snare, And, with our heart's blood, did to Freedom seal Fealty! France, loved France, now feels the iron heel! 28 “Crushed, hated monarchy, again doth crush Fair France; mirk superstition again weaves, Successfully, her limëd web,—ay, flush With life, more than her ancient realm retrieves. Soul of Condorcet!—tell me that misgrieves My spirit, if unto thy thought profound Hope scintillates; if thy strong vision cleaves The clouded future, and thou viewest unbound Loved France, and Europe quake at her old trumpet-sound. 29 “Deep-searching Spirit, tell me, did we err— Deeming the Palestinian story fraud Or dreams, while we ourselves the dreamers were; Deeming Earth's sceptres a pernicious gaud, And dying to defend the banner broad Of Universal Liberty, while meek Obedience unto kings, and reverent laud Our duty was, of Him the fablers sleek Extolled—the Torturer stern of Man from vengeful pique 30 “Belike I err, even now, and more involve My being in woe, thus lightly Powers august And solemn naming. Yet,—the strong that wolve The weak!—the powerful that grind to dust The helpless! Can I err, yearning to thrust Them from their thrones? My brother, if the doom Of man be hopeful, tell!”— With thought robust And daring, thus the sombre spirit whom Buzot addressed replied,—scorning exordium:— 31 “‘The spirit of Prometheus doth but sleep Within the human heart,—lulled, drugged, and drowsed, By Power's robed mediciners who keenly keep Watch o'er its breathings,—and have ever choused Their prey into more slumber, when aroused For a brief breath by Freedom's vital touch, It startled its sleek keepers, who caroused, Gaily, beside their prostrate victim's couch— Thinking it safe, for aye, within their privileged clutch! 32 “The spirit of Prometheus doth but sleep Within man's heart: the dark, blood-feeding brood Of serpents that so hush around it creep,— Now they perceive, with apprehension shrewd, Their terror-Trinity of Crown, Sword, Rood, Is near evanishment,—may justly dread The ruthless vengeance in its waking mood Of the heart's Titan thought. Up from its bed 'Twill spring, and crush the asps that on its life misfed! 33 “The spirit of Prometheus doth but sleep: The Mind's tornado wakes, through earth, even now! And soon it will to nought the fabric sweep, Of age-reared Priestcraft, and its shapes of woe,— Its Hell, Wrath-God, and Fear—that foulest foe Of human freedom! ‘I will freely think!” 'Twill boldly tell the surpliced cozeners—‘Lo! I dare your monster God!—nor will I shrink His tyrant tortures to defy—ev'n though I sink 34 “‘Amid the bottomless abyss of pain ‘Ye say He hath created for His slaves! ‘There let Him hurl me!—and, despite the chain ‘Irrevocable, that binds me under waves ‘Of liquid flame, He shall find one who braves ‘His wrath, and hurls back hatred for a God ‘Who forms without their will His creatures,—graves ‘Their natures on them,—rules by His own nod ‘Of Providence, their lives,—and, then, beneath His rod— 35 “‘His scourge eternal, tortures them, without ‘Surcease or intermission!’ Endless fire For a breath's error,—for a moment's doubt! Infinite Greatness exercising ire Relentless on a worm! Why? That the quire Celestial may His spotless glory sing— His attributes harmonious made by dire Infliction on his worms of suffering,— And He Himself in joy ecstatic revelling! 36 “Oh! what a potent poison hath benumbed The human mind, and robbed it of its might Inherent! since—affrighted, cowed, begloomed, And stultified,—this juggle of the Night It kneels unto, and calls ‘divinest light!’— But, it will soon the jugglers' toils outleap Who long, behind the altar of their Sprite Of blood, have played at terrible bo-peep With Man! The spirit of Prometheus doth but sleep!”— 37 He ceased, and proudly from his visage flashed Exultant hope's intensest radiance. As, when around Jove's Titan victim crashed The bounding thunder, and no mitigance Of pain the vulture gave, his soul's expanse Of hope for mortals filled with thought sublime The offspring of Iäpetus, till glance Of lightnings was forgot, and space, and time: And Caucasus grew joyous as Elysian clime! 38 Silent and solemn musings held the band Of patriot Shades, until, with suave aspect And diffident, the spirit of Roland Thus spake:— “The universe her Architect “All-wise proclaims; since without maim, defect, Or vain expenditure of means are all His works beheld: their Author they reflect: Unseen the Central Light Himself'mid pall Of His Own brightness shrouds,—the Godhead personal! 39 “Yet men deny Him not because their ken Detects not his pure Essence,—neither fail To hymn His all-pervading goodness, when They view pain through His universe prevail: But, rather, as becomes their fmite, frail, And borrowed life, sum up their dwarfish praise With meek confession that poor reason's pale Includes not perfect judgment of His ways Who of Infinity the boundless sceptre sways. 40 “Soul of Condorcet! if we now indulge The sceptic's thought, provoke we not the scourge We inly feel? Woes, ceaseless, here promulge The vengeance of our Judge. Forbear to urge His justice! Penal sojourn us may purge From earthly stain. Let us, by duteousness Of mind, assist the cure; devoutly merge Our pride in awe; and reverently confess Our wisdom blind—His wisdom's goodness question-less!”— 41 “I marvel at thy fear,”—in haste replied The sombre spirit: “yet I 'sdeign to blame “The weakness of a brother; but confide, By power of ministering reason to reclaim Thy mind from cowardice. Roland! the game Of priests hath turned upon that master-trick For ages—‘View thy finiteness with shame, And bow before the Infinite!’—Their quick Presentment of that cheat still serves the politic 42 “Successors of the Jewish fishers rude, As it subserved the hierarchs of old That, through the Orient, primal thought subdued, And humbled to the dust man's vision bold, Which would have scanned their secrets uncontrolled. Roland! bethink thee what the cheat is worth! Grant that Infimty cannot unfold Itself to finiteness; that worms of earth Their Maker's government behold but in its birth; 43 “Grant that man, seeing but a fleeting part Of God's illimitable kingdom, knows Too little to fill up the boundless chart By guess; yet, needeth it no operose Deduction of our reason to disclose This truth unto the simplest, shallowest brain— In the vast future God cannot oppose Himself: new attributes if He sustain Hereafter, Man now hymns his perfectness, in vain. 44 “Thou callst God's goodness perfect: yet, ‘It may Consist with perfect goodness,’—say the priests,— ‘Atoms of helplessness to damn, for aye,— ‘Although Man's finite reason manifests ‘Rebelliousness against such dread behests ‘Of Infinite Sovereignty: it may appear ‘Lovely, hereafter,—though Man now detests ‘Such hideousness, nor doth, in heart, revere— ‘Whate'er his lips profess—this Monster stern, austere: 45 “‘It may appear throughout eternity, ‘Right and consistent,—though in time it seems ‘Monstrously wrong,—that His philanthropy ‘Which in creating man so brightly beams,— ‘A thing in whose vile nature never gleams ‘A spark of good desire,—a thing thus made ‘Ere it could choose,—which evil good still deems. And thence can choose but evil—till arrayed ‘With power Divine it shuns its former nature's shade, 46 “‘And seeks the light of holiness,—it may ‘Consist with His philanthropy to curse ‘This thing because it never kneels to pray, ‘And He withholds to infuse the will!’ Rehearse These subtleties the Priests until they sperse Man's mental strength, and blind him with a dust Of postulates: a dust that doth immerse All things in doubt; confounds false, true, base, just; And jeopards even their godliest saint's devoutest trust:— 47 “For, if—still perfect—God can violate Some of His Own great declarations, who Dares say it will His excellence abate If He break others? May it not congrue Also with His perfections to eschew Fulfilment of His promises of bliss Celestial to the worms that render due Observance to His laws? Folly, than this Quirk of old Austin, ne'er framed frailer artifice:— 48 “The cozener, seeking others to befool Sottishly fools himself. For, hath the saint A firm dependence for that rest of soul, That endless cloyless joy his scriptures paint, If God of His own moral Self so faint A portraiture vouchsafes that what He saith Must be interpreted without constraint Of Reason, which Himself hath given, and Faith— That is, the Future—must give meaning to His breath? 49 “If what He saith in Time, by what He doth Throughout Eternity, must be explained, How shall His worms repose upon His oath? Seeing that He sweareth by Himself, unstained Would be His word—by deeds; since what pertained Unto Himself men had not known! And, thus, The saint, though shorn of bliss, and in Hell chained To burn, thrust down with sinners,—murderous And false, no more than they,—could term the All Marvellous!”— 50 “Soul of Condorcet!”—harshly spake the ghost Of Pétion,—“I thy thought deep-searching own; “But wherefore is our after-life engrossed With this tame wordy-war? Need we impugn Stale, senile fables which the wrinkled crone, Old Superstition, yet doth croak and crool Unto Man's infancy? Her dying moan Will soon, on earth, be heard: no human mole Will long be left to grope beneath her nighted rule. 51 “Shall we our torture's scanty lapse misspend By coward reasonings on this side the tomb? The strife with scorn why not thus tersely end— Saith some cowled fabler—‘Shall the clay presume ‘To prate unto the Potter, nor succumb ‘To his behests in silent awe?’—It shall— Thou knavish priest,—if such behests bring doom Of endless torment on the victim thrall Compelled, without its choice, through mortal life to crawl.”— 52 “On dreaming dolts,”—the shade of Valazé Exclaimed,—“fraternal suasion were misspent: Dolts whom their craven fears will lead astray From manly thought as soon as they have lent Audience to reason. Slow and impotent Of soul, Roland, on earth, thou always wert; But, here, in after-life, new wonderment We feel, beholding thy dull mind begirt With fabling dreams thou soughtst, elsewhere, to controvert. 53 “Weak, fickle spirit, on old Earth, mis-sexed! Conjugal tie revealed to human ken The woman's soul unto thy clay annexed: 'Twas thy brave helpmate breathed 'mong souls of men True manhood—the immortal Citoyenne! Dim, wavering Shade! when wilt thou strive to break This feminine bondage unto weakness? when Demean thyself like to a man? Awake, Dreamer!—thy spirit of these fraud-forged fetters shake; 54 “Or, if thou lovest the dreams that appertain To fools, seek the self-exiled climbing throng That share yon hill. Hence, Folly we in vain Have striven to make wise! Spirits, with strong Derision let us chase this slave of wrong Forth of our fellowship!”— “Thou viler slave, Forbear! Expurge the errors that belong To thine own spirit ere thou fume and rave Against thy brother, thus intolerantly brave!”— 55 So spake, and fiercely frowned, the Jacobin, Le Bas,—who with a look of stern delight Beheld, thus far, each haughty Brissotine Scourge his tame brother. Soon, to join the fight Of words hastened full many a sturdy sprite Badged of ‘the Mountain’—when the strife of blood. Raged in distracted France: Girondist wight Gave gall for gibe: fell combat seemed renewed Of Freedom's doubly suicidal brotherhood. 56 Malevolence, and spite, and rancour burned Through their thin vehicles, with lurid flame; And madly, that he were, once more, disurned From the dark tomb to play an aftergame Of blood, each yearned, and did with zeal proclaim His frantic wish! So horrible it seemed To witness how they raged, that being became A torture; and, unconscious that I dreamed, Methought I mourned as one to baleful life condemned. 57 But, lo! a sudden, silent pallor seized The hostile crew, beholding where upreared A Shape threatening as spectre unappeased By devilish wizard who beholds afeard The power his sable mischief hath unsphered, But lacks the deeper skill to lay. Atween Two cirque-stones vast the huge, gray Shape appeared So stone-like, and so blind, yet stern, of mien, That nought proclaimed it human save its gaberdine.— 58 “Dark atheist blood!”—the mystic Shape began; “Cease to malign Him Who the sceptre wields Of Universe, all Being's Guardian! Whose glory seraphs chaunt on heavenly fields; Whose favour from their foes earth's chosen shields; Whose vengeance ye, in Sheol, the Hebrew word for Hades, or the region of the departed. deeply prove! Foul sons of Belial! even your hatred yields Proof that Jehovah, from His throne above, Governeth Men as much by judgment as by love. 59 “Did ye not tear each other like the wolf And bear on earth? Did ye not rend and rive Your fellow-clay until one crimson gulph Your city seemed? Here, in the soul, survive Its cherished evils: judgment punitive Condemns ye thus to ravin in your minds, And slaughter with your thoughts. Nor will ye strive To burst your dimning veil, for that each finds Foul pleasure in the darkness which his spirit blinds. 60 “Judicial blindness is your guilt-won lot:— And, though ye mock, your hard impenitence I here rebuke. Until,—foul pride ye blot From your soul's core, and that Hell-born offence, Your self-willed doubt,—and bow with reverence Duteous to the Most High—returning peace Ye ne'er shall know: but torturous turbulence And rage of vengeful passions shall increase Within ye; nor shall ye your wandering penance cease. 61 “Jehovah hath a quarrel with your pride. Think ye that He will deign to justify Himself to atoms unto Nought allied? Not to the proud into His ways that pry— But, to the meek who on His word rely, He showeth favour.”— “Slaughterous Shophet the Hebrew word for Judge, or Ruler. Shophelim is the title of the Book of Judges, in the original.hoary”— Condorcet's spirit hurled back proud reply,— “Repeat no more thy oft—told doting story!- We bow not to thy Blood-God's homicidal glory! 62 “Meek champion of the lofty deity Who clave the ass's jaw-bone to reprieve Thy murderous life, rather than cleave for thee A thunder-blasted tomb,—though Fraud misweave Such shapes as His and thine, to disbelieve That ye exist—we dare! Abortive dreams Of lust and blood incarnate! fools receive For high realities the priestly themes Of your strange deeds: Wisdom such barbarous tale contemns! 63 “Unreal shape, begone! False mist thou art; Engendered of our insane rage and broils; Or, with a myriad other mists athwart Our thoughts that flit, thou and thy god are foils Of truth, which, when her strength she overtoils, The purblind Mind creates—” “Blasphemers bold!”— Samson burst forth in ire, while the hoar piles Of stone shook to their bases,—“leave untold “Your daring sneers! Provoke not vengeance manifold! 64 “Vile slaves of self-deceit!—vaunt not your zeal For truth. Whence is this horror ye profess For violence? If ye to earth appeal What saith she, shuddering, of your foul excess Of fratricide? To whom could ye address So fitly as to Murder Deified Your vows of blood? Powers whose enormousness Of massacre and ravine thought outstride High o'er the rites of mutual butchers should preside. 65 “Affect no more this horror, so demure, Of His strict rule Who portions penance just Unto the filthy: favour to the pure. Could ye be gods, to sate your ravening lust For blood, whole human hecatombs slaves must Pile on your Moloch-altars day by day! Your lives disprove your claim to style august Of high philanthropists: ere ye inveigh 'Gainst murder and revenge, mercy yourselves display! 66 “Brood of assassins—ere ye mock at deeds Achieved by Israel's champion—with your own Compare them. Faiths ye scoffed at—yet for creeds Slaughtered each other! To destroy the throne Ye banded, since a monster curse 'twas grown— And then o'er crowds enfranchised raised the knife!— I wonder Earth, with headless corses strown And drenched with gore, from such horrific strife Shrunk not upon her axle till she quelled all life! 67 “Ye slaughtered for the sake of blood: I slew My foes in self-defence. Ye murdered whom Yourselves made free!—I crushed the brutal crew Of haughty tyrants who to slavish doom Sentenced my fatherland,—ay, in one tomb O'erwhelmed myself and them, rather than live Myself a slave—my country slaved! To dumb Confusion are ye stricken? Let shame revive!— Her glow, though late, may prove of wisdom nutritive. 68 “Now, list my embassy from souls of kings And Gentile Shophets who in throned conclave Ye know, at lapse of penal wanderings, Sit girt with pomps, and visioned splendours have. Whether the Power that breathed all life Man gave Unto his brother like the ox and horse To minister, a sturdy, craft-trained slave For food,—or did ‘Equality’ endorse On human natures—they pursue abstruse discourse. 69 “Such is the essence of their strife—surround It as they may with mist of words. Had ye Less madly played your part millions unbound Might now proclaim the coming jubilee Of nations: Sheol's Thrones, through sympathy, Forbode their fall—conscious of mystic tie That binds them with Earth's crowns: their destiny And Man's they seek: I bid ye to the high Debate:—but, first, your souls' dark errors rectify! 70 “I leave ye to self-chastisement—that scourge More poignant than all tortures from without. May deep-wrought penitence your spirits purge From the foul stain of atheistic doubt— That ye, at length, may join the choral shout Of ransomed millions, when to end all pain God's great Messiah comes!—that vision fraught With bliss the rapt seers saw on Jordan's plain And Judah's sacred hills. Jehovah, haste Thy reign!”— 71 He spake and faded,—as some threatening cloud Of fearful shape disperseth in thin air, Leaving no trace to show where, ebon-browed, But now, it frowned and darkened to despair The eye of day. No more with rage to tear And rend each other burned the jarring host Of patriot Shades rebuked; but, to declare His chastened thought began Babœuf's pale ghost— Equality's last self-exile from Gallia's coast.— 72 “If brothers still we be,”—he said,—“and zeal For contest has not cancelled loftier sense Of right,—let us essay this strife to heal With kindliness: not vengeful virulence Will chase from Mind its raylessness intense, Nor free it from fanatic mists obscure. Boast we of Reason?—let us evidence The gift by pointing, with persuasion pure, Our weaker brother unto Truth's bright cynosure. 73 “I yield not to this terror-shape belief In his old fables; neither fail to know That earthly tyrannies derive their chief Strength from the fear with which men quake and bow To Powers Unknown. Yet, brothers, do we owe Regard to these rebukes; let each, then, list; And cease these poisonous gibes whereby our woe Is deepened,—soul to soul antagonist Becomes,—and Earth's old jars in after—life exist. 74 “Fled we not hither less by inward dread Of ignominious death than sick at heart With our abortive strife, in which was shed Torrents of Frenchmen's blood? Oh! let the smart Of anguish for self-errors here impart Regretful tenderness for frailties shown By brethren. Still, I fear, these storms athwart Our after-life will come! My stain I own; And would by present pain for errors past atone!”— 75 “Spirits!”—rejoined Condorcet,—‘Humbled thought Doth not avail mind's errors to expel: Self-chastisement for frailty nurtures not The growth of wisdom: Reason doth rebel Against the slavish gloom which priests so well, For their vile ends, depicture as the true Discipline for the soul. They most excel In wisdom who the past can calmly view With deep resolve error in future to eschew. 76 “Ay, they are wisest, best, who still maintain The calm, firm, steady toil to emancipate Mind from its frailties: Tears, on earth, are vain, And low regrets, in this our afterstate: Man's noblest part is still to battle Fate, Or Circumstance; or whatsoe'er afflict His essence;—joy, as grief, to moderate By Reason's rule—not monkish rigour strict: Rule that with ease the soul may gratefully addict 77 “Herself to serve; and by sure steps, though slow, Thus climb Elysian height serene. How long In circles shall we reason? Whence the woe We here experience—save from passion strong And changeful? Spirits! let us not prolong Debate amid these ruins; but the theme Renew where kings invite polemic throng Of essences!”— I woke: for, like a gleam Electric, vanished the wild actors of my dream! BOOK THE SIXTH. 1 Blood! blood! Ye human hell-hounds, when, oh when Will ye have had your fill? The hazy morn Hath scarcely dawned upon this grisly den Of demon Power, ere yon poor wretch forlorn Is led to slaughter:—led? nay, fainting, borne Unto the ladder's foot! Murder by law— In lieu of medicine till his wits return— For one impelled to kill, by his brain-flaw; And then to weep, when he his slaughtered infant saw! 2 It is the death-toll: there! they bear him on! I climb to read the lesson through my bars.— Hah! curse upon thee, priest!—is it well done That thou, a peace-robed herald pattering prayers, Dost head the death-march? Trowst thou not it jars With that sky-message which proclaimed, thou sayst, ‘Peace and Goodwill to Man’?—ay, that it mars The face of mercy to behold thee placed There, in grim state, 'tween spears with crape, in mockery, graced? 3 'Tis passed—the chilling spectacle! Farewell, Poor pale, weak, fellow-worm! 'twill soon be o'er— Thy tearful pilgrimage. 'Tis done!—the knell Ceases: and though I, happily, see no more Of the fell tragedy, the sullen roar Of groans and execrations, pierces through My dungeon-grating; for the gazers pour The heart's involuntary curse on you, Ye hireling butchers who now ‘give the law its due’! Six human beings underwent capital punishment in front of Stafford Gaol during the two years I remained in it. The entire procedure in any one instance, of course, I could not witness; on one occasion, only,—when, on account of the early hour and season of the year, I had not been removed from my night-cell,—I beheld the grim preface to the legal butchery. Without repeating testimonies of reflecting men who have attended executions, as to the hardening effect of those savage spectacles,—I will just observe that while the sound of the death -bell for the first execution filled me and my fellow-prisoners with paroxysms of distress,—on the second, third, and fourth occasions, we became comparatively unconcerned. And, when I was left a solitary prisoner, the sound of the death-bell for the last time; created a few bitter thoughts of the abhorrent and uncivilised nature of the impending tragedy; but a kind of careless disgust followed, from the instant reflection that all my dislike of the brutal transaction was vain. And, within ten minutes after the death-bell had ceased, I actually caught myself humming “The Banks and Braes o' bonny Doon!” Now, a more sensitive and excitable human creature than myself perhaps, does not exist: but there is the honest fact—such as startled me by its strangeness, at the time:—let the advocates for the usefulness of capital punishments, as “impressive moral lessons,” make what they can of it. 4 Oh! I would weep throughout the live-long day With memory how my fellow-man hath wept Through ages, and bewail him as the prey Of foul Draconian beasts which he hath kept In reverence high; but, that I feel, except The melting mood be mastered, and fierce ire As well, and Man becomes a calm adept In tracing errors to their spring, the fire Of that real Hell that burns on earth shall ne'er expire. 5 Why should I curse thee, priest? Art thou not bound To obey thy patched creed's dogmas? ‘Blood for blood’ Thy rubric reads,—with logic most profound! And, lest by disobedience, the world should Halt on its axle, ye, meek brotherhood! Must see the ‘Law Divine’ fulfilled. He meant Not what he said—the Nazarene—the Good! Or, still the rubric stands for murderers: blent With mystery is God's law: Himself knows His intent! 6 Hah! how long will ye palter thus, to screen Your conscious inconsistency, and hide The Truth from Man? Either the Nazarene Or Moses errs. And, if stern homicide Man's homicidal will so well could chide Of old,—the Law of Blood, maugre all change, Must still be wholesome. But, ye should abide By all the Law: ‘eye,’ ‘tooth,’ ‘hand,’ ‘foot’—avenge, Avenge!—Ye may not from the whole a part estrange! Compare Exodus, chap. xxi., verse 24, and Matthew, chap. v., verses 38, 39. 7 Doff, then, thine alb, and don the ephod, priest,— If thou art Moses' minister; Ah, no!— Thou too successfully and long hast fleeced The sheep in that white garment to forego The gain of doubleness. Neither art thou And thy smooth tribe unskilful to discern That while ye must stand by your yokefellow, The hangman, and together deftly learn To prop kings' sway,—fair uses hath your coat extern: 8 It symbols meekness well, and peace, ye preach To slaves: Christ's precepts are for them! Your drame Hath thus its parts, and ye are prompt for each! Dark ambidexters in the guilty game Of human subjugation! how to tame Man's spirit ye, and only ye, have skill: Kings need your help to hold their thrones; while claim Of sanctity enables ye, at will, To wield o'er prostrate Reason subtler empire still! 9 What tyrants leave unvanquished in the mind By threat of chains, the gallows, flame, or sword, Ye humble by your Hell!— Was I not blind— To judge ye inconsistent? True accord Subsists between your new and elder ‘word,’ Ye throw away no part: it is because, With cunning shrewder than the simple horde O' the laity, ye ken the penal clause Blends in one spirit fierce the old and late Jew's laws. 10 ‘Forgive them, for they know not what they do!’— O Christ! how worshipfully great thou art Uttering such dying breath! A lowly Jew, Born and brought up with bigots whose old heart Was nurtured, from far time, to count the smart Of suffering in a foe sweet to behold; From rule of blood for blood ne'er to depart,— Of eye for eye, and tooth for tooth; to fold The law of vengeance, given while the thunder rolled, 11 And lightnings flashed, and the loud trumpet pealed Forth from the shrouded hill, in the heart's core, As dearer than all treasures earth can yield; Law eulogised, confirmed by Prophets hoar, By solemn awe-rapt bards, and all the lore Thy country ever knew! If not Divine Thou wert,—thy self-born light and love is more Miraculous than aught by all the line Of the heart's precept-makers writ in page benign. 12 Hunted to death,—nailed to ‘the tree of shame,’— Fainting, expiring,—and thy last heart-prayer Breathing for them who gibbeted thy name Above that thorn-crowned head, nor did forbear, When spirit-desolation or despair Seized thee, to mock thy groans! Forgiveness,—love,— For those who tortured thee! Oh! if such rare Triumph o'er ill be human, it doth prove A glorious nobility in Man enwove! 13 And 'tis enwove in man: else, wherefore pleads High reason in that prayer?—‘they know not what They do!’—Compassion for a being whose deeds Resulting from his ignorance denote His errors accidental: not inwrought By natural vice, or willed, in Reason's spite, When Knowledge shows the wrong. By Reason brought Thus to regard our brother, inner might Of love fraternal springs, and Pity's calm delight. 14 What sayest thou, priest? ‘It is not thus’? Do threats Of Hell, then, fill the heart with this intense And holy bliss of pitying love? Begets Thy rhetoric of the flames which Providence Almighty ever blows for bodily sense (By miracle also made eternal); worm, Deathless and sateless, preying without suspense On conscience: do these horrors sow the germ Of love in Man, and threats renewed its growth confirm? 15 And yet, thy Master preached this Hell: with all His sovereign magnanimity, and free Expanse of soul, the Nazarene a thrall Remained to the old desart-Deity,— The ‘jealous’ Vengeance-God!— Shrewd Priest! of thee I judged but shallowly: thy puzzle-book Thou readst more skilfully than I; agree Thy teachers twain: the Galilean shook Not off from his large mind the mountain-thunderer's yoke. 16 Hell-fire,—coercion,—for the ingrate hard Who will not love the God set forth as high, Vast, indescribable, in His Love's regard For Men! ‘Love Him; or He will magnify ‘His glory by consigning thee to die ‘In ceaseless flames an ever-living death’!— O Christ! how can I love what doth outvie All tyrannies in horribleness of wrath: This monstrous Thing derived from an old monster Faith? 17 Thine, Galilean, is of all earth's creeds The greatest marvel! Wonder at thy toil Of tears, self-sacrifice, and love succeeds Each step we tread with thee—till this dread foil Unto thy moral beauty doth despoil The yearning heart of its impassioned hope: Death-stricken, blighted, doth the soul recoil From its tempestuous wish to love thee: droop It must in doubt; and to its bourne in darkness grope! 18 Oh! hadst thou not so lovely been on earth, I would not care to share thy Paradise: This wish to live beyond the grave hath birth Without my will: yet, by the sovereign voice Of Reason 'twould be hushed, but that the bliss Of knowing such a heart as thine doth seem A boundless joy,—a good beyond all price: And still I wish thy heaven were not a dream; And, to my latest hour shall doat upon that theme! 19 Alas! thy repetition of that most Enslaving of all slavish thoughts—a Hell Wherewith the Priest may threat to tame the ghost Of him who dares in mortal life rebel 'Gainst Faith or Kings—restrains the heart's love-swell Rushing to centre in thee, and reveals To Reason that thou couldst not burst the spell Of Circumstance—which even the mightiest seals In impotence: we do but act as she impels. 20 Greatest of moral miracles thou art: In godlikeness above all godlike men: Pardoning thy murderers, even while thy heart They pierced: born in a land where rock and glen, On every hand that met thy love-lit ken, Were during witnesses of brothers' blood Shed by, or for Jehovah!—Denizen Of such a clime—Child of so fierce a brood— What wonder at one speck in thy vast sun of good? 21 One link—thy penal Hell,—with the old Past Of Force, the homage-time so reverent— Connects thee: but, thy themes of mercy vast, Of love and brotherhood,—the aliment Shall be for kindred souls on love intent And mercy, every hour, until the might Their spirits draw from thine all-prevalent Shall render them; and they shall chase the sprite Of Blood and Force that doth all human joyaunce blight. 22 Goodness, thou didst enthrone: our generous sires, Drawn by thy generous themes, Woden and Thor Abandoned, quenching all their idol-fires To worship Whom they called ‘the Good.’ Before Goodness personified thy Gospel's lore Taught them, they thought, to bow; and ‘God’ became Their Deity The established etymology of the word “God,” is that which derives it from the Saxon adjective signifying good, as I have given it in the text. But there are scholars who doubt of the correctness of this derivation. “The chief who conducted the Goths into Scandinavia appears by his Gothic names Odin, Wodan, and Godan, to have been confounded with the Deity, because his name, like the Persian Udu, the Gothic Aud denoted power; . . . . The Bodh, Voda, or Vogd of the Indians, Tartars, and Russians, the But, Bud, Wud, of the Persians and idolatrous Arabs, the Qud or Khoda of all the tribes of Turkey throughout Tartary, the Godami (Gaudama) of the Malays and Ceylonese, appear to be merely different pronunciations of Wodan, especially as bodh or boodh in Sanscrit and the common dialects of Hindostan is used for our Wednesday or Odin's day.”—Thomson's “Observations introductory to a work on English Etymology: John Murray, Albemarle Street, 1818.”—See also Godfrey Higgins's “Anacalypsis.”— What small shrill voice doth pour Its wailing from that grated window-frame? What note of Pain doth thus my feeble brain-steps maim? 23 Hah! murderous spider! when I watched thee spread Thy cobweb yestermorn, it did relieve A dreary prison-hour to mark each thread From thee, thou magic artisan, receive Its faery texture: while I saw thee weave That dædal miracle, this poison-thought Rose not that now impelleth me to grieve Much more than to admire—to grieve and doubt, As, in a torment-web, like thy poor victim, caught!— 24 Priest! dost thou smile, beholding how Thought's web Baffles and binds me with its mystery,— Yea, lays me, helpless as a limber babe, At Mystery's feet? Oh! I will slander thee No more: if Nature hath a Deity, The Bible doth not slanderously limn His portraiture: Author of agony The living book doth, hourly, picture Him: The written—thrones a Slaughterer 'tween the Cherubim! 25 'Tis clear: who tries the Faith by Nature's test— O modern Stagyrite!—between thy creed And Her must own ‘Analogy’ confest. The ascription of the epithet “modern Stagyrite” to the mitred author of the celebrated “Analogy” may seem untasteful to the learned reader; but I could not resist the wish to register my conviction, in some form, that of all the reasoners for the truth of written Revelation, Butler is the most potent. — ‘Submit thee, then, vain doubter!—since decreed ‘It is that Life consists of things of greed ‘And things to be their prey,—submit and bow ‘To Him who made them thus: back, that may lead ‘Thee to the Faith in which, thou dost allow, ‘The Deity drawn with Nature's girded brow!’ 26 Priest! I will answer thee with that free soul These bolts and bars have only served to thew. Forty short summers towards my earthly goal Have I now journeyed,—and, for me, but few More summers can remain: Wrong to eschew, And Right to treasure in the heart's recess, How can I lack dispose,—while, to my view, The grave is yawning in its cold duresse To close what tyrants leave of my clay's feebleness? 27 Priest! I have felt by turns from earliest days, As well as calms, the tempests of the brain: Fervid devotion, and the wild rapt blaze Of ecstasy in prayer; ascetic pain And fasting; midnight book-toil to obtain The key to facts—knowledge of tongues of old; Weighing of evidence—grave—long—again; With constant watchings how Man doth unfold What is the impress true he bears from Nature's mould;— 28 And this, in humbleness I would declare, And yet with courage, is my only Faith:— Goodness alone, with its blest, yearning care, Is worshipful—for Goodness only hath Power to make good and happy things of breath And thought. If Man can be transformed Wholly to virtue,—punishment and wrath,— Taught by all priests that on the earth have swarmed,— Must be untaught; and Man by Love to Right be charmed. 29 Goodness alone is worshipful. Not what Gives life, but what gives happiness is good. I cannot worship what I own a blot To be in my own nature—hasty flood Of feeling that with ireful hardihood Would rush to do what I would soon regret: Nor can I worship, priest! thy Shapes of Blood, Or Nature's cause of Pain. If to beget Love in the soul these fail—shall worship there be met? 30 I cannot worship what I cannot love.— If this be vicious, priest! show me the way To virtue: I will own—if thou dost prove— My error: but, till then, I humbly say, I think the error thine. To resurvey, For proofs of Deity, great Nature's face, Drawn, yea impelled, unto Mind's latest day, I shall be by Her wonders; but—the embrace Of All-pervading Goodness—shall I find it's trace? 31 I say not that there is no God: but that I know not. Dost thou know, or dost thou guess? Why should I ask thee, priest? Darkness hath sat With light on Nature—Woe with Happiness Since human worms crawled from their languageless Imperfect embryons, and by signs essayed To picture their first thoughts. 'Tis but excess Of folly to attempt the great charade To solve: and yet the irking wish must be obeyed!— 32 Night hath returned on me,—even as it closed Upon these dizzying thoughts in human things Thousands of years ago:—Two Powers opposed Eternally,—or Good with boundless wings Brooding o'er Universe—the egg whence springs Evil: the Mede's, Hindoo's, Egyptian's strife To make himself believe some glimmerings He saw of Truth, through Nature's garment rife With Mystery: Hebrew fable of primeval life 33 In happy Eden—Eve, and glozing snake: Or myth more artificial of the land Of arts and song—Pandora's box, with ache And boil and pestilence, by man's rash hand Unlidded—punishment for theft of brand From Heaven:— Night hath returned, as she returned To millions, who through life thus vainly scanned The face of mystery. What, though they burned In vain to know, yet never Nature's secret learned? 34 Desire to know must still within us burn— Though its quick fire our fragile clay consume: For who would crawl in brutal unconcern Along his fated pathway to the tomb, Nor ever ask if thought-flame shall relume This clay, or it shall sleep a dull, dark, cold, Eternal sleep?— I slept, and dreamt the doom Of suicidal souls—great souls of old— I did, once more, in mystic spirit-land behold. 35 The thrones were set, in gorgeous show, beneath The rainbow-roofed and column-girt expanse, Filled with the votaries of self-wrought death I saw before; and with like cognizance Of crown and sceptre, shedding radiance From gems and gold, they sat,—or, lesser state Kept, as of civic power's participance The fitter emblem. 'Sdeignfully elate Some sat, while some sent forth deep glances of debate: 36 For, mingled with the thrones, rose seats of strange Fantastic structure—seeming, medley-wise, The courage, cunning, pride, despair, revenge, The love of fatherland, or high emprise, Wisdom, or eloquence, to symbolise Of their famed occupants—a lustrous host Begirt with rays, whose thoughts wore no disguise,— So that my spirit scanned each musing ghost, And read the characters in his mind's book engrossed.— 37 Transcending far, in grace, all regal thrones, Twin seats neighbouring the godlike Spartan's stood, O'ercanopied with bended necks of swans, And wings of doves circling their callow brood, Adorned beneath with blossom, bell, and bud, The loveliest of every season's growth, In garlands woven, upon drapery strewed With bees that swarmed on infant Plato's mouth, And lucent shells that gem the sea-shore of the south: 38 Whereon, sat he whose lightning-tippëd tongue Had made Greece glorious unto farthest time, Had Socrates ne'er lived, nor Homer sung, Nor Marathon been found beneath her clime; And, by his side, his brother Greek, the prime In rhetoric art, Isocrates,—whose pen Could fill the Attic mind with throes sublime,— Ay, fire the brain of humblest citizen With ecstasy unknown to gross-souled, late-born men. 39 An elder glory, near Demosthenes And his fraternal sprite, on radiant seat Upborne, like Neptune's chariot on the seas, Appeared: prows of the Persian's prostrate fleet, And eagles' wings, and tridents—hatchments meet For victory—with oaken wreaths, adorned His bright shell-chariot; while with prancing feet, His fish-tailed steeds the waveless pavement spurned, And,proudly,to the roof, their wide-spread nostrils turned: 40 And throned in glory sat the illustrious shade Of him whose name with Salamis shall live For aye,—'less Freemen fail and Freedom fade On every shore, and some new Xerxes give To earth his will for law, and ocean grieve, Mirthful no longer at the tyrant's whip.— That latest Greek who struggled to retrieve His country's greatness, and the plumes to clip Of Rome's fierce eagle, by Achæan captainship, 41 Sat next Themistocles,—the latest Greek Worthy the name,—Diæus,—who, when fell Corinth with Carthage, scorned to live a meek Breath-unit in a world now Rome's, or swell Her earth-spread train of slaves. Immoveable Sat Zeno, stoic sire, on shapeless rock Of ebon granite, with a look to quell Kings' mindless pomps, so loftily it woke The regal soul to spurn false grandeur's gaudy yoke. 42 His noblest Roman son the suicide, Of Utica, with simple oaken crown Adorned, sat on a kindred rock, and eyed The enervate Antony upon his throne, Until he seemed to shrink beneath that frown, And shun its keen reproof. A mystic shape On milk-white steed, girt with a starry zone, Sat smiling as he saw the pavement gape: Emblems of Rome's cleft forum, Curtius, and his leap. 43 Twin-seats, again, I saw, near Antony's,— But, unlike his, of iron mould,—and blazed With sword and spear, and manifold device Of slaughter,—whereon sat the twain oft praised For patriots: the aristocrats who raised Their daggers 'gainst the despot—not to pave Plebeian paths to Right; but, long bedazed With freedom false, patrician power to save: They who, near Philippi, sped, world-sick, to the grave. 44 And near them Caius sat—th' Agrarian,— Cornelia's younger boast,—the truly great And good, though stamped with History's hireling ban. With simple oaken chaplet he kept state Kings seemed to envy, as he smiling sate On cornucopias shedding Ceres' fruit From wreathëd gold,—while o'er him bended date, And olive, orange, fig, and cocoa nut, Festooned with vines, and draped with green gourds round the root. 45 On either hand the Gracchus, miniature Array of honours gilded Carbo's brow,— With his young head that once, by act impure Of vengeful Sylla, his great father's foe, Bedecked a pole i' the forum for a show— Jugurtha's conqueror's son. The younger Marius.—For affirmation of his suicide see Appian de Bellis Civilibus, lib. I. C. xciv.With these appeared Full many a Roman ghost that fled from blow By bestial Cæsars threatened: souls that feared Not death itself; but—to die tyrant-massacred. 46 Nor lacked there Roman spirits of the days When Rome and her old gods of friendly faith Were nullified by new Byzantium's blaze, And its exclusive creed. Crowned with sere wreath, On mouldering columns, Photius sat, who death— A freeman's death—preferred, to humbling loss Of self-respect,—giving away his breath When false Justinian bade old Pagan gloss Should cease, and all the world bow down before the Cross. Photius. —“A secret remnant of Pagans, who still lurked in the most refined and most rustic condition of mankind, excited the indignation of the Christians, who were perhaps unwilling that any strangers should be witnesses of their intestine quarrels. A bishop was named as the inquisitor of the faith, and his diligence soon discovered in the court and city, the magistrates, lawyers, physicians, and sophists, who still cherished the superstition of the Greeks. They were sternly informed that they must choose, without delay, between the displeasure of Jupiter or Justinian, and that their aversion to the gospel could no longer be disguised under the scandalous mask of indifference or impiety. The patrician Photius, perhaps alone, was resolved to die like his ancestors: he enfranchised himself with the stroke of a dagger, and left his tyrant the poor consolation of exposing with ignominy the lifeless corpse of the fugitive.”—Gibbon, chap. 47. 47 Rome's elder terror, by the Pontic king Appeared—the one-eyed Carthaginian: Athwart, he sat, upon a living thing Of monster form—a seat equestrian, Blending an elephant whose forehead's span Was vast as Hindoo Ganesa's; a pard With hide besprent, like that gruff Scythian By Ceres changed; Lyncus.—Ovid.

And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself.” 2 Sam. chap. xvii.—Suicides, it seems, had “method in their madness,” even in those days.On pile Of hybrid life—half-bull, half-desart-steed— Sat Eleazar, of the Maccabees' bold breed. Eleazar the Maccabee (I Mac. chap. vi.), who “put himself in jeopardy, to the end he might deliver his people,” by slaying Antiochus (though he only succeeded in slaying Antiochus' elephant), is usually classed as a suicide, by writers on that subject. 49 And Razis See 2nd Maccabees, chap. xiv., vers. 37—46, for an account of his wild suicide.near him sat, on monster beast More fell, commingling tiger, wolf, and bear, With claws and beak of bird that maketh quest For dead men's flesh.

And other suicides assembled there, Of Gallic mien, gazed haughtily, and frowned, As if they liked not well the regal pomps around: 50 These shapes, methought, were they whom, late, I saw, When wandering over Freedom's desert plain, I came unto a mound, and stood with awe To see the hoary cirque— the ruined fane.— And other spirits which had filled the train Of my night-visions I, again, beheld: The bards were there from Phantasy's domain— The mystic grove; and with these sprites of eld Came, now, a late-born host which in that region dwelled. 51 And, from the Mount of Vanity, methought The Indian and the Agrigentine seemed To be remet,—while they had with them brought Of spirits I beheld when erst I dreamed, A host whose essences defiance gleamed For contest of the soul. Nor lacked they feud For long: mind-syllables, terse, vigorous, beamed Forth from the spiritual similitude Of the great Pontic king,—who thus debate renewed:— 52 “Spirits! who waits preamble, or proclaim Of thesis, since to all our argument Is known? The Spartan saith this goodly frame Of kingly pomps Nature hath sagely blent With typic forms—on our instruction bent— And foretells utter change—Equality, Knowledge, and Joy, for ever confluent Through Hades; and for Earth like destiny. Say, Spirits, with the Spartan's do your thoughts agree?”— 53 Thus Mithridates spake; and, straight, the theme Cleanthes seized. With meek and modest grace At Zeno's feet he sat, and diadem Or tiar of gold upon his brow to place Had mockery seemed—so brightly beamed its trace Of mental nobleness through the rare veil That clad his essence. In that mystic space, When he arose, kings' splendours seemed to pale In glory, 'fore his soul's refulgence spiritual. 54 “Monarchs, and bards, and sages old,”—he said; “I utter first, my humble sentence brief, That spirits of deeper reach, and skilled to thread The maze of symbol, type, and hieroglyph, May follow, more at large. I yield belief To Nature's sage interpreters of things When Reason guides their theme; but, for my chief In wisdom I acknowledge none who clings Fondly to worship of his own imaginings. 55 “If Reason guide the Spartan, it is well: If Phantasy, I heed him not: unskilled, Myself, in riddles, I will simply tell My judgment from within. On earth, I toiled A menial slave by night, Cleanthes is a noble Greek example of mind triumphing over difficulties. He was at first a “fisty-cuffer,”—as the old translators phrase it, in the edition of Diogenes Laertius “made English by several hands:” 1696;—“but coming to Athens, with no more than four drachmas in his pocket, and meeting with Zeno, he betook himself most sedulously to the study of Philosophy, &amp;c.” “By night (says Enfield, who renders Laertius more elegantly) he drew water as a common labourer in the public gardens, that he might have leisure in the day-time to attend the schools of philosophy. The Athenian citizens observing that though he appeared strong and healthy, he had no visible means of subsistence, summoned him before the court of Areopagus, according to the custom of the city, to give an account of his manner of living. Upon this he produced the gardener for whom he drew water, and a woman for whom he ground meal, as witnesses to prove that he subsisted by the honest labour of his hands. The judges of the court were so struck with admiration of this singular example of industry and perseverance, that they ordered ten minæ to be paid him out of the public treasury, —which, however, Zeno would not suffer him to accept. . . . . . . Cleanthes was for many years so poor that he was obliged to write the heads of his master's lectures upon shells and bones, for want of money to buy paper.”—The suicide of this philosopher, at a very advanced age, was singularly quiet and yet heroic. His physicians recommended fasting for some disease with which he was afflicted; and having abstained from food for two days, although he had thus subdued his disorder, he refused to eat again, saying that since he had travelled so far towards the end of life he would not go back again,—and accordingly died by voluntary “total abstinence.”—The testimonies to the elevated morality of his life are abundant.my toil beguiled With sweet thoughts how the morning would renew Wisdom's boon nurture, that by day distilled From Zeno's spirit on my soul like dew, Until my being to intellectual stature grew. 56 “And, if the Past I could live o'er again, The joys of wisdom to the gauds of power I would prefer: even now, while in my ken Glow regal grandeurs, how they seem to cower Before the spirit's nobler, loftier dower— Wisdom and Virtue! Monarchs, to offend I seek not: but that changes o'er ye lour I also prophesy! Man will ascend To truth, and soon unto false glory cease to bend. 57 “Mind is awake, in Hades; while, on earth, Crowds ask aloud what truthful reverence Mere show can ask; demand the proof of worth From Privilege that lolls in indolence While Poverty toils on with pang intense Of bodily hunger; and proclaim, in ire, Their stern resolve, that throned magnificence— The dullard son derives from doltish sire— With conquerors' pomps, late won by murder, shall expire!” 58 He ceased; and Appius, Rome's old lecher vile, With base effrontery uprose to jeer. But indignation burst from regal pile O' the Pontic king, that whelmed with shame and fear The rude one, and subdued his scoff and sneer; And albeit Nero Mithridates blamed, Yet, on the lewd decemvir fell severe And ireful glances from a host ashamed To call him Roman—till he fled forth spirit—maimed!— 59 When, lo! a filthy and obscene baboon Upgrew in Appius' seat; while kings aghast, Dumbfounded, gazed to see the creature soon Take up the Roman's staff, he, in his haste, Let fall, and mock the pomp of each dynast That there held golden sceptre! All were mute With wonderment—till darkness overcast The throne where lately sat the dissolute Old Roman,—and then vanished throne and savage brute; 60 While, in the rainbowed sky a giant hand Appeared, and pointed to the throneless void, Filling the wonder-stricken sceptred band With deepest dread. Lycurgus, meanwhile, eyed The change with smiles,—yet not as one that joyed To view the Roman's sufferings, or his fall,— But, seeming glad to know one shape destroyed Among those images of human thrall— As earnest that like change should pass upon them all. 61 He spake not: but the monarch-spirits gazed With awe upon the Spartan's volumed look, And read his thought.— By splendours unbedazed, By prophecies or fears of change unshook, The aweless Carthaginian silence broke:— “Will this strange visitation check the boast Of haughty Rome,”—he said,—“this vengeance-stroke Of the high Powers that rule this mystic coast, Offended with the Roman monster's obscene ghost 62 “Such was Rome's progeny in her fresh youth— Her age of public virtue—when, with vaunt Of kingly vipers crushed in their young growth. Her victor plebeians swelled their choral chaunt! What wonder, then, that her exuberant Maturity conceived gigantic forms Of turpitude, so foully miscreant, That Nature shuddered to reveal their germs, And, while their mother bore them, darkened earth with storms! The last lines of this stanza were composed under an impression that an earthquake or violent tempest signalised the birth of Nero, Caligula, Domitian, Elagabalus, or some one of the monsters who presided over the Roman world. Memory, it seems, betrayed me; and I had no means of correcting my inaccuracy, in prison.—The mistake, however, does not seem of such importance as to demand that I stike out the lines of the stanza, or substitute others for them. 63 “And shall their images sit here enthroned With virtuous shapes, while thus the Powers Divine On one take vengeance? Will they thus confound Desert with baseness? Not from typic sign, Abounding in this mystical confine, I prophesy: but confidence in Right, 'Spite of reverses the Gods intertwine With Virtue's warrior course, fills me with bright Anticipations they will yet the Good requite. 64 “That ruin threatens Thrones of bloated vice, I doubt not; but, that Good with Ill shall fade, I credit not the Spartan aruspice.”— Thus Hannibal the gathering fears allayed Of some; but rendered guiltier Thrones afraid Their fall was near,—so that with fiendish rage These swelled: but judgment soon the tempest stayed! Two of Rome's swoln embruted lineage Evanished from the view of king, and bard, and sage; 65 And, for brief season, upon Nero's throne A tiger sat upright, with robe bedecked, And glared upon a swine Bonosus' crown That wore, and held its brutal shape erect Upon the drunkard's seat. Each did affect Despotic airs, sceptred and diademmed, Till, by the lesson did his pride detect Full many a ghost that there sat crowned and gemmed; And some within their essence royalty condemned. 66 Anon, fell darkness on the mimic brutes; And then a void was left where each robed beast Had sat with mock-monarchal attributes; While, from the roof, huge pendant hands impressed Deep dread—pointing to either space divest Of throne and image—that the Spartan's word Might soon be signally made manifest; And silence chill, such as in sepulchred Earth-regions dwells, did long that hall of Thrones begird.— 67 At length, uprose the Gracchus, and with calm And graceful act, but look that inly glowed With noblest fervour, laid aside his palm, While thus, in generous tide his accents flowed:— “Spirits, that sit mysteriously endowed With sign of sovereignty, I now conjure Your essences by these strange judgments bowed, Say,—if it would Man's general bliss ensure,— Could ye bemoan your empty splendour's forfeiture? 68 “What veritable good, in your proud joy On earth, could ye possess? While hunger keen Tortured the Poor, did not your banquets cloy? Could ye, beholding ragged Misery's mien, Feel really happy in your grandeur's sheen? While thousands wandered homeless o'er the soil,— Worn, suffering, fainting, wretched,—did ye lean On your soft pillows won from Labour's spoil, And never think with pity on the sufferer's toil? 69 “It could not be: for ye had human hearts: Ye knew men were your brethren, and deep thought— Such as men feel when wounded conscience smarts— Must oft have stirred within ye, and have smote Your bosoms with remorse, until it brought Ye well-nigh to resolve ye would descend From your afflictive thrones, and bring to nought That human scourge—your power; all woe-toil end; And, to life up mankind your life-long effort lend. 70 “Ye must have thought—to banish want and sorrow Would bring the heart more truthful happiness Than all the gaudy lustre ye could borrow From the toil-worm, for robe and train and jess,— From jewelled crown, and gold in its excess:— But ye were held by Fate; her power restrained, Controlled, benumbed your wills that yearned to bless Your weeping brethren, and ye thus remained Agents to work out evil,—and for evil reigned. 71 “But Evil brings forth Good, as Good, of old, Evil produced,—so now, when all things shew The mystery of Existence doth unfold Some glimpses of its issue; and the True From out the hollow False doth brightly glow, And cannot, longer, be from Man concealed,— So now, Good shall result from Evil: woe And want shall cease; Man's heart-ache shall be healed; And, in your fall, the true Elysium be revealed. 72 “Do ye not joy at this, even now, discerning What potent sympathies unite old Earth And Hades?—with what aspirations yearning, Spirits in penal realm are giving birth To large fraternal thoughts that wander forth Diffusing faith that all shall gladness prove? Kings,—brothers,—stifle not the germs of worth That now within ye spring! With us commove To usher in the jubilee of Truth and Love!”— 73 The Agrarian ceased; and with his passionate plea Enkindled, rose the Attic orator:— “O kings, can outward state ennoble ye,”— He said,— “can visionary blazons more “Exalt ye, than the healing balm to pour Of gentle goodness on your brother's soul? Oh, is not goodness truly regal? Frore With gold and gems, and frowning cold control,— Is he, indeed, a king,—whose heart's unpitiful? 74 “Is he not truly an ignoble churl Who knows no heart-thirst for another's weal? O kings, how small the sacrifice to hurl Aside these vanities, if ye could feel True brotherhood with Man! Earnest appeal The generous Roman to your nobler thought Hath made; but still your essences reveal Returning sternness, and returning doubt Whether these judgments ruin to your thrones denote. 75 “Ye cleave to your old state, and still believe Abandonment of shining sovereignties Would argue weakness while these emblems weave Assurance that your destiny defies Assault from Hades' dim confederacies, Lapse of duration, or foreboding seer,— And yet, how know ye, monarchs, that the guise Of mystery which shrouds this penal sphere Ye penetrate, and read with comprehension clear? 76 “Before the Spartan's augury ye spurn, I challenge ye to answer,—while the hand Of ever-fashioning Nature ye discern Mingling, on earth and through this mystic land, The frightful with the beautiful and grand— The pleasant with the painful—woe with joy— Perfection with decay: hath she thus planned The universal frame for a huge toy, That she may, endlessly, be building to destroy? 77 “Can ye at such sage judgment, kings, arrive— That the vast Soul of all things works in sport And mockery? Or, is all preparative Of some great issue, merely? Inexpert To make a universe that shall consort Each part with each, so that no blot shall mar Its pure, consummate beauty, Fraud malvert Its boon design, or Force diffuse foul jar Through its blest harmonies—judge ye the High Gods are? 78 “Or, rather, have they not in embryo left The mighty macrocosm, for some great end Of all-pervasive bliss to be vouchsafed Hereafter? Powers paternal that extend Their providence to all, we apprehend The sovereign gods to be; and ye will seem Most like them, kings, if ye in pity bend O'er earth and Hades, yearning to redeem All being from woe, and render Joy and Love supreme!”— 79 Thus spake Demosthenes, while kindred glow Of earnest and fraternal love suffused The visage of Themistocles, and threw Such glory round, that some the cause espoused He rose to plead, ere language had aroused The intellective sense his theme to scan:— As when, among earth's orators, hath choosed, From some exterior grace, each partizan His favourite, ere debate proclaims the nobler man. 80 “Monarchs, your brotherhood with man I plead,”— He said:—“knowing no higher theme from whence “To argue that your essences self-freed Should be from this false supereminence: And, if that plea prevail not, eloquence I lack to charm with guileful words the mind Which knows no worship for the excellence Of goodness. Kings, I plead for humankind! Aid us our race in earth and Hades to unbind! 81 “It is to noblest, loftiest sacrifice I call ye: sacrifice of selfish loves And preferences—to swell the overbliss Of all Humanity. Think ye, who proves His truthful greatness thus, where'er he moves, Shall not reap grateful reverence of more worth Than all your pomps? ‘Thee, brother, it behoves ‘Our souls to love!—blest bringer of our mirth!’— Bliss-throngs beholding him, with smiles, shall utter forth. 82 “Thy glance significant, O Pontic chief! Reminds me that on earth man's gratitude Is slow of growth, and of existence brief,— While patriot deeds, by jealousy misviewed, Oft, for their guerdon, yield unkindly feud. Great spirit! magnanimity exalts Man more, far more, than power: who hath subdued Revenge for injuries, and all the faults Of brethren with compassion yearns, wins blest results. 83 “I dwell not on such thoughts: if I had wrong From fatherland,—O name that wakest the thrill Of tenderest love!—wrong's slender sense hath long Evanished. But, I ask, what wrong, in will, Or word, or act, kings bear from man? Deep ill Monarchs have wrought each other; but the race Of Man hath reverenced the most imbecile Of regal shapes, nor ever sought to abase A monarch till he made his realm a charnel-place. 84 “Nought have ye, then, to pardon; but, to ask Forgiveness, rather. Yet, to see him lay His gorgeous gauds aside, and cease to bask In splendours wrung from woe, would throw a ray Of glory round a king so bright that they Who witnessed it would deem him all-divine, And doubt he ever had borne evil sway. All earth would honour him: his deed benign Spirits would magnify, through Hades' dim confine. 85 “O kings, be truly noble! For the weal Of All, your high volition exercise, And burst, through Earth and Hades, the dark seal Of sympathetic evil that now lies On being. Come, aid us in the bright emprise, Begun on earth, nor in these mystic realms Deserted: for we will antagonize With Wrong till victory crowns our spiritual helms, And boundless love and joy the human spirit whelms!”— 86 The Athenian ended; and the Hebrew king Raised his colossal form, with tremulous haste To tell how freely he away would fling All shows of grandeur, to repair the waste Of human bliss and see mankind embraced By boundless love.— “Kings, Shophets, seers,”—he said,— “By ordinance Divine in Sheol placed On thrones and mystic seats, what can bestead The human soul from garish gauds thus round us spread? 87 “If on our wills the general bliss depend, What can withhold that now we abdicate These royalties,—the reign of Evil end— The revelry of Wrong? And, wherefore wait Till some more signal judgment consternate Our essences? Ye seem unmoved! and I Doubt deeply whether zeal to emancipate Tophet and Earth from penal torment's cry, And suffering's groan, will meet the smile of the Most High. 88 “When Samuel, in my sight, to pieces hewed The royal Agag, whom I longed to save, I saw that when Jehovah had a feud With his poor human worm, He would not wave His claim to justice; but, upon the slave Who dared to step between His holy wrath And the doomed victim, He would vengeance have— Slow,—signal,—sure! The Everlasting's path Who can find out?—who comprehendeth what He saith? 89 “His prophet did my humble head anoint, And said the Lord had chosen me to rule. Exterminating war God did appoint On Amalek, next:—His ways are wonderful! When I besought, at His Divine footstool, Pardon for weakness, Agag's holy slayer Said God did not repent like man!—How dull Are our perceptions! Did He not declare Me monarch, and repent?—He who refused my prayer? 90 “All, all is mystery! I desired no throne:— My father's asses, as I, following, roamed O'er the wide wilderness,—if on me shone The cheering sun, or sterile Nature gloomed,— A kingdom seemed to me. But I was doomed To know the mockery of earthly bliss!— And is not Sheol mockery? We are wombed In dread and doubt, fearing to do amiss; And, to do well, lack power to burst our destinies!”— 91 Abruptly, in despair, thus ended Saul, And on his throne sank down; while smoothly rose Achitophel, and round the regal hall Glanced,—then, obsequious, cringed, ere to disclose His frauds he made essay, or to dispose Them in the guise of truths:— “Potential Shades, And great Regalities,”—he said;—“why lose “In arguings vain—since mystery being pervades— The respite to deep pain Nature for ye here spreads? 92 “Why thus afflict your essences with fears? Why droop, dispirited, and pale and shrink, As if the soul were still a thing of tears, As when it wore earth's clay? What, if some think, Or dream, that these imperial pomps shall sink To nought? where is the doting prophet's proof Of his true inspiration? Not a link Is broken that your thrones, with wonder-woof, Blends with these columned shapes, and this supernal roof. 93 “Judgment hath fallen on the guilty seats Of some: what then? On earth stern judgments fell On the incorrigible: guilt still meets Its bad desert: this is nought new. Dispel Your gloom, great kings, that in high thought excel, Soaring beyond the crowd! Like eagles, preen Your splendours, and this boding prophet quell With wingëd vengeance! Shall ye suffer teen, Because this dreaming fantast thus doth overween? 94 “Monarchs are gods, in lustre and in strength: Thrones were, and are, and shall be: they exist By an eternal fitness: neither length Of spiritual duration hath decreased Their virtue, nor can captious casuist Allege true reasons for their overthrow. I challenge anarch revolutionist— By thoughts of reach, not dreams—sound cause to show Why Thrones, in Sheol and on earth, to Change shall bow. 95 “Thou, regal Saul, spakest of thy earthly course. Know thou, that monarchs by good counsel stand, And fall by evil rede. Changes, perforce, Must come: young Comeliness will, aye, command More love than Age: valour to wield the brand More worship than sleek sloth: issue of joy Awaiteth kingly acts in every land, Unless the monarch doth his heart upbuoy By fulsome counsel, and his own fair peace destroy.”— 96 Thus spake the Hebrew courtier-suicide, And looked for plaudits; but, the Maccabee Rose up in haste, his glozing strain to chide:— “This from Rebellion's counsellor do ye Endure?” —he said;— “the flames of anarchy Who blew with viperous breath—shall kings advice Receive from him—the tool of Treachery? Shall not the part this hoary cockatrice Played, while on earth, to prove his worthlessness suffice? 97 “Oh, monarchs, nobler, holier counsel take! Not scornful war to wage on the calm ghost Of the Laconian, vile revenge to slake; Not of your gaudy pomps to swell and boast, Regardless of the souls in Tophet tossed In agony, and of Earth's myriads born To pain, and in degrading cares engrossed: Oh, treat not thus the Spartan's words with scorn; If, by some deed of yours, mankind may cease to mourn! 98 “Oh, cleave no longer to these grandeurs vague, If they the jars and wounds of earth prolong— Slaughter and famine, pestilence and plague, Bondage of weaker brethren to the strong, Envy and hatred, robbery and wrong! The bards on Judah's mountains, where we drew The sword against our tyrants, in their song Foretold Earth, one day, should be born anew, And smile with brotherhood of all—Gentile and Jew. 99 “And if, in Sheol, the Danaian's mind Survey the future with prophetic glance— Discerning inmost sympathies that bind Earth's thrones with yours—the deep significance Perceiving of strange shapes that but enhance The wildered wonder of inferior souls— Monarchs, resist not His high puissance Who universal destiny controls, And, to His chosen ones, the fatal scroll unrols.”— 100 Thus Eleazar spake; and Nicocles, The Paphian king, essayed, with gentle zeal, To aid like counsel:— “That the stronger seize The weak,”—he said,—“and trampled nations feel “The conqueror's burthen; that victorious steel Bereaves the widow and the orphan child Of earthly hope and joy; that human weal Is sacrificed to Power, and Man is spoiled Of every good, by Wrong; proofs Earth, for ages, piled. 101 “And, while on earth thrones stand, monarchs will vie With monarchs, in excess of pomp and power; Slavery and woe conquest will multiply; And Death, in crescent shapes, mankind devour. Not before dreaming oracles I cower, Fearing more pain from ruin; but to purge Hades from present pain, and speed Earth's hour Of jubilee, brothers, like suit I urge, That we in equal state these sceptred splendours merge!’- 102 “And I,” spake Otho, “join the fervid prayer, “And plead for preference of the general good To sordid selfishness, and empty glare Of unsubstantial shows: our brotherhood With man demands it: while our thrones have stood Thus mystically radiant, clouds of gloom Have enwrapt millions, men shed brother's blood, And Toil's child found no refuge but the tomb! Spirits, to quit these pomps, I give my instant doom!” 103 Lo! while the Cyprian and the Roman spoke, Transcendant glories decked their glowing brows, And joy-beams from the Spartan's countenance broke, That seemed a peerless light to circumfuse On thrones and statues. Inly to arouse His vengefulness, Achitophel essayed; But utterance failed; and, shuddering with strange throes Of some new torture that upon him preyed— A ghastly sight he stood; while kings looked on dismayed. 104 Distorted grew his visage, limbs, and trunk— Though spiritual essence—till they joined His reptile seat; and into it he shrunk With grin horrific, and, with it combined, Crawled, prostrate: hybrid monster undefined In loathsome hideousness: a shape more strange Than night-mared gourmand's glut-vexed brain e'er coined; Or madman formed, at full of moon, or change; Or bard, with frightfullest phrenzies smit, could misarrange! 105 Slow waned the uncouth horror-spawn from sight Of spirits, who, with stark marmorean look— Such as, at banquet, did the countenance blight Of Pelops' sire—sat, with soul-palsy strook: And with such goading sense of self-rebuke Ached the Cathaian and Assyrian kings, Nile's queen, and paramour,—they could not brook To be beheld,—but hid, like guilty things, Their faces: smitten with remorseful torturings. 106 Kings' faces, now, with apprehension deep Were filled, and some, to wailing words gave vent: When, like a veteran seaman who would keep Undaunted heart, though sails and cordage rent, And rudder broken, render impotent The pilot's strength and skill,—and fear and grief Burst from young sailors' tongues with eloquent Expression of despair,—the Pontic chief, Though shook, thus sought, with speech, to minister relief: 107 “Spirits, I rise not to renew debate On human rights, nor arguings to gainsay Of those who favour new and equal state In Hades and on earth. Let him who may Contend 'gainst Nature's impulses that sway The soul to tender and fraternal thoughts— If custom did not blight them in our clay, And taint the spirit's essence. No cold doubts Have I, that Men, as brothers, share like attributes. 108 “Nor do I cleave to kingship from regard To Nature's great distinctions, though she gives With choice, not blindly: genius of the bard To one; deep reach unto the sage who dives Into her mysteries; prerogatives Of leadership, not less, to some who wield A natural power o'er men—a strength that lives And germs within, compelling men to yield Unto its forceful energy where'er revealed: 109 “I dwell not to repeat what hath been told— How Nature thus elects, yet doth impress, Each human essence with so like a mould, That all are brothers in their helplessness— Children of Fate—driving to refugeless Despair their kind, or being, themselves, forth driven. Maugre these thoughts, if mankind may possess General beatitude when thrones are riven From their foundations—let the judgment now be given! 110 “Wherefore this pallor, brother Thrones? Why faint And fear? When we threw off our mortal load And gained these shores, unlike what earth-dreams paint Of life beyond the grave, we were endowed, At torture's lapse, with pomps, in kingly mode, Ere we could choose. What guilt, then, have we nursed, By wearing these regalities? what rod Deserved? in what new penalties amerced Shall spirits writhe? in what new regions be dispersed? 111 “And wherefore fear, if such, for Nature's sport, Be destinies that wait us? Let us meet Them calmly, since we cannot controvert Our fate. I pause—to see upon his seat, Neither unsceptred nor discrowned, as yet, Imperial Otho, and the Cyprian prince. Wait they the Spartan's sign? Why doth his threat Tarry in its fulfilment? Monarchs, since Thrones fade not, wherefore should mere bodements us convince? 112 “Wise men use omens for their ends, on earth, While fools and weaklings see, or hear, and quake. Star-gazers saw a comet, at my birth; And, at my father's death, I saw it shake Its fiery hair, as it the world would wake To see a king. The double omen served To fix expectant looks on me, and make My name, itself, a host. That knowledge nerved My soul to combat Rome: my courage, else, had swerved. The comets which apprared at the birth of Mithridates,and at the period of his ascension to the throne of Pontus, together with their significance of the future greatness of this remarkable potentate (whom Cicero terms the greatest that ever reigned) are alike matter of the gravest history:—“Hujus futuram magnitudinem etiam cælestia ostenta prædixerant. Nam et quo genitus est anno, et eo quo regnare primum cæpit, stella cometes per utrumque tempus septuaginta diebus ita luxit, ut cælum omne conflagrare videretur,” &amp;c.—Justin. Hist., ilb. 37, cap. ii. 113 “Not to the fiery star,—but, to kind rule I trusted to infix my subjects' love; And, while I left each astrologic fool To prate of hosts he saw in heaven above, Asia's vast swarms I sought, on earth, to move Against all-grasping Rome. Knowledge and Will Enable men and spirits oft to prove Superior to all circumstance of ill; Ay, render them, by Fate itself, invincible. 114 “Kings, if we quail, we draw destruction down: Resolve preserves our state. Thrones, I aver, The energy of will upholds each throne In Hades, nor can prescient sorcerer These dazzling seats from their foundations stir, If we put forth resolve.”— He ceased, disturbed; And though his words of resolution were, His strength was weakness. No applause reverbed Through the wide hall; for, apprehension thought absorbed. 115 Deep silence reigned, until the Spartan rose, With godlike dignity, and thus began:— “Spirits, I triumph to foresee the close Of Error's reign. Kings hold their last divan. When next beneath this arch cerulean We meet, All will be equal! But I cease To prophesy; and calmly trace the plan Of Sovereign Nature, since She seeks your peace, Your joy, Spirits! that henceforth, endless, shall increase. 116 “Error from human ignorance darkly sprang. As children misname things, and shout or shriek, From pleasure or affright, so mankind sang, In rhapsodies of joy, the golden streak Of morn; and, when they heard the thunder speak, Bowed down in awe, and wept. Infants in mind, They marvelled, and made gods of visage meek Or terrible; and, then, to them assigned Rule o'er the sun and cloud, the sky, and sea, and wind. 117 “Thrones, likewise, sprang from human ignorance. Nature's rude elements presented war For Man: rocks, earth-flames, ocean's vast expanse, Storms, forest, savage beasts, were found to mar Man's ease or rest: on every side a bar Opposed itself, alike to further good, Or present peace. Then, he an exemplar Was held who overcame by hardihood, Lion or bear, horrors of cavern, flame, or flood. 118 “Such were old Earth's primeval monarchs: kings, Leaders, by courage, holding simple sway— If sway they held—by useful compassings Of larger means for nourishing man's clay. O Mithridates, when I heard thee say Some were born natural leaders, unto these I turned—the chiefs of patriarchal day— Comparing them with lords that Earth now sees: The puny hildings man approaches on his knees! 119 “Cities were built, and man subdued the soil. But, now, Craft grew, and seized on mystery— Life, death, sun, stars—all that the sons of toil Saw without comprehending; and, with glee, Secret but strong, made Man a devotee Become, credent and humble—reverent laud Rendering unto the Priest as lowlily As to the gods this minister of fraud Said he heard speak,—while men him listed, overawed. 120 “Then, between Priest and King grew contest rife For mastership; and Ganges and old Nile, Whose sacred servants foremost led the strife, Beheld the proof, in many a mighty pile That deckt their marges, how completely Guile Could triumph over Strength. But, in the end, Altar and Throne felt it unworth the while To waste each other,—since they shrewdly kenned The prey enough for both: so King called Priest—his friend! 121 “Long, dreary, miserable years have fled, Since the foul compact first was ratified, By Priestcraft placing on throned Kingship's head, With hands in reeking blood of victim dyed, The gaud of gold—the sign of kingly pride: Long, dreary, suffering, weeping, wailing years. Oft have the bruised and trampled sufferers tried To rise; but the Priest's curse woke inward fears, And they bowed down again unto their toil with tears! 122 “Yet, in some climes, the sufferers dared a deed Of glorious boldness: breaking Kingship's chain, And,—standing upright, from their fetters freed,— Sang songs of joy that o'er the purple main Floated in triumph, till the startling strain Kings heard in other lands, and called their slaves To arm, and quell the sacrilegious train. And, often, when their menials crossed the waves, They gained, in patriot-land, not conquest—but, their graves. 123 “But, Treason germed, even in Freedom's womb; And Power and Craft were born again—the twin Ubiquities of Evil that still gloom The bleeding world, and widely o'er it win Accursed sway. Thus, ever to begin Anew was Freedom's struggle; and the proud Dulity of Thraldom did but grin And mock, at length, thinking the strugglers cowed By loss, and sunk into a helpless, murmuring crowd. 124 “Hence, out of Evil, Good hath grown: for, now, Good shall begin to overcome. The strong Become remiss, the weak to overthrow Their masters, and redeem themselves from wrong Safely aspire. Thus, Right its sinews strung Afresh while Might securely slept, or woke For dalliance and debauch: thus Right, grown young And strong, by hardship, will throw off the yoke Of hoary Might too palsied to withstand the shock. 125 “Say ye, Right's triumph, like a dream, shall fade, 'Neath swift rewaking vigour of throned Power? Monarchs, be not deceived! Right, now, hath aid From Knowledge—hid by priests in secret bower, And when thence 'scaped, caught, and to dungeon-tower By them condemned—yea, to the fiery flame! They knew not of her high immortal dower— The veritable Phœnix—whom to tame, Or to destroy, will ever mock old priestly aim! 126 “Lo! she hath ta'en young Freedom by the hand, And, in the strength and comeliness of youth, Supplanting Craft and Power in every land, And heralding the reign of Love and Truth, They go! Yet little reck they of the growth Of Right and Knowledge, who the glorious pair Regard not: the besotted shapes uncouth That dream, like age-crampt spiders in their lair, Their cobweb safe, though 'tis a sport unto the air. 127 “And ye, in Hades, monarchs, though beholding Judgments on monstrous vice, are slow to yield. Meanwhile, on earth, like judgments are unfolding: For, thus, in mystic sympathy upsealed, Of mortal men and spirits unannealed The destinies remain; and, soon—though Might, Counting her hirelings proudly horsed, and steeled, The judgments mocks and scorns—a total blight On Power, and Craft, and lordly Privilege, shall light. 128 “Kings, by your own great deed; ye can avert The threatened ruin. Let the glowing themes Of brotherhood, before ye urged, exhort Ye to denude your spirits of their dreams Of selfish good—to cast your diadems And sceptres down—resolved the grand emprise To aid of glorious Goodness! I see beams Of high resolve from forth your essence rise: Though, still, in some, old Prejudice doth agonize! 129 “How vain that agony! The strains of truth And loving earnestness, full souls have poured Forth to your thought, shall work within ye ruth For human woe: and, soon, resolve matured Shall be within ye to make firm accord With Mercy's gentle champions: for, it hath Been here proclaimed, that some have long explored The way to end Man's misery, strife, and wrath, And bring in Peace,—if, haply they might find the path. 130 “And, brothers, here we solemnly obtest The Sovereignties of Nature that the toil We will not end, till Men and spirits blest Hold general jubilee!”— He said;—and, while He stretched aloft his hand,—from motley pile And throne, great souls arose, and instant raised A hand aloft—each with a godlike smile!— And light empyreal from each Essence blazed, Until I woke,—with the bright vision soul—bedazed! BOOK THE SEVENTH. 1 London! how imageable seems the strife Of thy huge crowds amid this solitude! Instinct with hot, heart-feverous, throbbing life— Racers for Mammon—day by day renewed— Quick, motley actors in Mind's interlude— They flit before me; or again, I walk Wonder-lost less with splendours unendued With power of thought than human shapes that stalk Though thy vast wilderness of ways, and, smiling, talk 2 With their own wretchedness which hath estranged Them from their kind, but cannot stifle dreams That Beggary's rags shall, one day, be exchanged For Grandeur's robes, and Fortune's favouring beams Gild their last hours. These, these, amid thy streams Of populousness, thy lavish shows of pride, And pomp, and equipage, were living themes For healthiest thought that did my folly chide When I, along thy streets, a gazing 'venturer, hied. 3 Oh! if the heart doth crave for loneliness, Deep in thy crowded desart it may find Its drear wish realised. In Misery's dress— Their blighted visages to humankind A pregnant lesson, but their names enshrined, Perchance, in secresy—how stealthily Such hermits of the heart glide on behind The bustling men of gain, or groups of glee That swell thy blended throngs of thrift and gaiety! 4 Oft have I followed such a stealthy form, To mark his whereabout of rest or home, Until he plunged into some haunt where swarm, In dingy dens, that shadow forth the gloom Of hearts within, what the World calls its ‘scumrdquo;— Victims of gilded fraud, and titled lust, And pensioned knavery! Will it e'er come— The hour when Man shall venture to be just, And dare to give true names unto his fellow-dust? 5 Age after age hath gazed the eager throng,— As, now, I seem, again, to see it gaze, Heedless of moral worth, or right or wrong, While haughty Pomp unclosed its newest blaze Of tear-wrung splendour: and, perchance, to praise Of garish show, blame for great gold misspent Hath followed, as it follows now: yet, raise The trump of pageantry,—and ears are lent By thousands who lisp scorn for Time's old rabblement! 6 Will they, one day, the clown and artizan, Strip off these swaddling-bands of gauze—these chains Of gossamer? This baby-talisman— Will it much longer charm the child of pains And sweat, to leave his bread-toil? Oh! there reigns Of strength in Labour's millions, a young breath That gaunt Starvation quells not, but sustains! Where, now, my memory wanders, may its wrath Ne'er burst!—Monarch, adown thy stately palace-path! 7 I saw thee on the day thou wast a bride, And shouted, 'mid my joy-tears, with the crowd: Thou wert a woman, and thou sattst beside Thy bosom's choice, while happiness o'erflowed Thy heart, and in thy fair young countenance glowed. Beholding thine, what could I less than feel A sympathetic joy? Ay, though a proud Worship of England's stern old Commonweal Was mine,—for thee, that day, I breathed devotion leal. 8 And many a heart, yielding, that festive day, To Nature's impulses of hope and joy, Confiding, blessed thee! Queen! if thou delay To help thy Poor—if thou, thyself, destroy The promise of that time, and harsh alloy Of blame with memory of our joy now blend— What marvel? Hopes, that do the heart upbuoy, Turned to despair by sufferings slighted, rend All gentle feelings in their way to some dire end. 9 When next thou passest by Whitehall, look up, I pray thee, and remember who felt there The fatal axe! Ay,—look!—nor be the dupe Of tinselled traitors who would thee ensnare To ease and grandeur, till—thy People's prayer For justice all too long delayed—they rise With that old heart the Stuart to despair Drove, first,—and, then, to vengeance! Hunger cries Throughout thy realm—‘Queen! from the fearful Past—be wise!” 10 I know that tellers of plain truths are ‘Goths” And ‘savages” in their esteem who haunt The halls of royalty—the pageant moths That flutter in thy beams—the sycophant, The beau, the coronetted mendicant. Yet, speak I not from brutal nature; nor Is thirst for violence fell habitant Of Labour's children's hearts. Queen! they who store Thy mind with such belief wrong grievously thy Poor! 11 Believe one born amid their daily toils And sighs,—and, since, observant of the words And deeds of those who live on Labour's spoils: Thy Poor, it is—and not their haughty lords— In whose hearts vibrate gentle Nature's chords Of tenderness for thee, even while they groan With deepest wrongs. ‘We suffer by the hordes ‘Of selfish ones,”they say, 'that hide the throne: ‘If she could know our woes, we should not, vainly, moan!’ 12 Lady! 'tis thus the hunger-bitten ones Their simple, lingering trust in thee express: Let thy heart answer—'mid superb saloons And soldiered pomp—with truth and faithfulness, If thou deservest this trust from comfortless And bread-pinched millions! Wouldst thou read aright Thy glory? Seek to be the heritress Of love deserved—choosing, with noble slight Of gauds, to make the Poor's heart-smile thy sole delight. 13 Alas! in vain thus breathes a rebel thrall Fond wish that, now a thousand years have rolled, To Alfred's land it might, once more, befall That sun of human glories to behold— A monarch scorning blood-stained gauds and gold, To build the throne in a blest People's love! It may not be! Custom, soul-numbing, cold, Her web hath round thee, from thy cradle wove: Can heart of a born-thrall with pulse of Freedom move? 14 Deadly, mind-blighting influences begird Thee daily, hourly: 'tis thy lot. A gaol Is mine. Thus far, our lot how like! The herd Of titled, starred, and sworded things, that fail Not to enclose thee in their watchful pale, Are but thy chief and under-turnkeys. Thou By birth, for life,—and I, by force,—this bale Of bondage prove. Rebel, or Queen, we bow Alike to circumstance: our mould to it we owe. 15 Oh! who shall mete due blame to things of earth? When, passing from that palace, heart-felt ire Doth rise, viewing a shame on royal birth Becolumned on that spot of moral mire,— When burneth momentary, rash desire To see him and the elder-born there swing On an eternal gibbet,—if the fire O' the heart flasheth within, will it not fling On conscience home reproof, and wholesome chastening? 16 Hadst thou who glancest on that pillared Shame Been—like him—next of kin to Infamy In royal robes, scant-minded, without aim Cast on the gaudy world that sought with glee To tempt or gratify his lusts—in thee Would the poor soldier, or his orphan-child, Or beggared widow, in their misery, So oft have found a heart whose glow beguiled Their tears with bounteous help until the mourners smiled? 17 Alas! from tears this balm of tears was wrung, Millions on millions toiled and pined and wept To clothe with Murder's panoply the young— The thoughtless—who to swift destruction leapt, Or back to home with maimed bodies crept— Winners of ‘Glory!’—while, to toil and weep Was still the millions' lot: if Death had swept Off thousands,—blood-garbed thousands more must leap Into the breach: War,—Madness,—must their harvest reap! 18 Dash down? Nay, rear more shameless columns! high And higher still! Ye are but niggard carles Who taste the fruit of ‘Glory!’ To the sky Lift up ten thousand trophies till it whirls Our blood to see them, and the foreigner gnarls His fingers in hot shame! Why do ye spare A corner 'neath yon mighty dome, for churls Like Howard, Reynolds, Jones, and Johnson? Tear The low quaternion down! Why stand their dull forms there? 19 'Tis Glory's temple! Glory—whose great brood Escape the gallows by a broidered coat And larger knife wherewith to shed the blood Of brothers! What meek traitor hither brought Philanthropy and Art, Genius and Thought, To stain the mausoleum of the great And grand in murder? Cast the cowards out! Their effigies do only tribulate His joy who here beholds what pomps on ‘heroes’ wait! 20 Briton! gaze deeply on the marbled crowd— Forgetting the mean four! Oh! let it swell Thy veins with ecstasy to view this proud Array of warriors—some, as if they fell But now, in Victory's arms, beneath the knell Of Fate—some, girt with blazonry of brand, Pike, cannon, war-ship, or brute shape that well Shows slaughter was their trade! While peal those grand Deep diapasons—bow, and reverence Glory's band! 21 What matter that yon vocal instruments Join the loud organ's thunder? 'Tis for bread They chaunt of ‘mercy,’—poor subservients! Bread, that their pampered masters, in whose stead They do this meaningless day-drudgery, spread In measure scant for each poor breath-machine: Shunning the task that irks both heart and head— To hymn the pitying thorn-crowned Nazarene Where laurelled Murder holds high pomp with marbled mien 22 Dost thou refuse to reverence Carnage vast, And hie thee back where glooms yon elder fane, Shrouding the mouldered great ones of the Past, With all its solemn glories of dyed pane And carven stone? Ah! Briton, who wouldst fain, Where sleep thy country's truly glorious few, In that dim ‘corner,’ joy in awe—restrain Thy heart! Fraud must to Force, its twin, be true: Mind must be banned, like Childe: they'll welcome Waterloo! 23 Perchance the Priest forebodes his end is near, Unless he come less lazily with aid To stem the torrent in whose strong career Thrones, altars, may be whirled! Shall they be stayed— Thought's whelming waves? Can Priestcraft's joint cru-sade With Carnage against Mind, arrest its course?— Oh, ‘let them grapple,’ as the great one bade, “And, though all the winds of doctrine were let loose to play upon the earth, so Truth be in the field, we do injuriously, by licensing and prohibiting, to misdoubt her strength. Let her and Falsehood grapple; whoever knew Truth put to the worse, in a free and open encounter?”—Milton's Areopagitica. ‘Falsehood and Truth!’—awhile Fraud linkt with Force May boast! but Truth shall one day, ‘put’ them ‘to the worse!’ 24 Let priest with warrior, old comates in rule, Join hands, and tear from vault and niche and shrine, From pedestal in fane and vestibule, The Heroes of the Mind! Let them assign Sole honour to the puissant Butcher line Throughout wide earth, beneath high heaven: the day Will come when the triumphing sun shall shine On earth renewed: not always shall his ray Gild Murder's monuments: they surely shall decay! 25 Oh! what wilt thou be, then, my country, 'mong The nations? Shakspere's home, and Alfred's realm— Land where our Chaucer, Spenser, Milton, sung— Where infant Truth decked Wickliffe's warrior-helm— Where Bacon burst Man's age-worn spirit-film— Footstool of Newton while he spanned the sky— Cradle of glorious names that fill and whelm A Briton's heart with love, and pride, and joy,— Wilt thou be great and glorious, then—freed from alloy 26 Of all thy old, mistaken strife to be Glorious and great? Wilt thou above the wave Then bear thy generous breast—Nurse of the Free, Alone—extinct the Tyrant and the Slave— And filled with Brother-Men; not beings that crave To see the murderer of one brother hang, Yet vaunt the ‘glory’ of each carnage-grave, From Agincourt to Waterloo, where sang The trumpet over thousands in their hearts' death-pang? 27 Will truthful greatness crown thy hoary age, Or desart-savagery its reign resume Wide over thee, and to the bard or sage Of far-off clime, new-born from mental gloom Hereafter, even Shakspere's name become A worn-out glory, or, like Orpheus' lyre, Fade into fable? On thy future doom Thy children, England, ponder with desire; Though vainly buried millions burned with kindred fire! 28 Another day is gone!—yet must the sun Bring other flowers than these cold things of Spring— Poor, puny prisoners, that, to look upon Raise tears—ere Time to me shall hither bring The hour of Freedom. How we still do cling Unto the world, as if we yet might find Therein substantial joy!— Fancy took wing, Again in sleep; and, in the realms assigned To suicidal souls, wandered the sleepless Mind. 29 Methought I passed adown the sculptured aisle, With a new band of ghostly travellers Whose visages were clad with smirk and smile, Although they looked as if earth's sepulchres Had newly cast them out: mirthsome compeers In grave-clothes, on they tripped, with glee more grim Than if a troop of monks or caloyers, Smit with some sudden madness or wild whim, Were seen to laugh and dance unto a funeral hymn. 30 And when they reached the dome-like space, methought In circle the strange crew took hands, and round They whirled, with laughter and delirious shout, Until the vault—'neath which I heard no sound Before—gave back such mirth as did astound These revellers in shrouds; whereat they wailed And wildly wept, and, each, the deathly wound By his own hand inflicted, swift, unveiled, And fiercely on himself for mad self-murderer railed! 31 A silent sorrow, then, their essence clothed, And slowly from beneath the dome they passed, With eyes that told how utterly they loathed Prolonged existence, and how fain would cast Its bondage off, with their old guilty haste, In spite of self-upbraidings, if the soul Were brittle as earth's clay. Upon a waste The wanderers now emerged, and sought some goal Where, with life-wantons like themselves, they might condole. 32 Laurels of conquerors, chaplets of vain bards, Bracelets of beauties, diadems of kings, Lay shivered on the waste with porcelain shards, And fractured counterfeits of jewelled rings, And robes in rags: of all Earth's gaudy things Some image there lay mangled, marred, or rent; And as they trod upon these symbolings Of their past pride, on mortal life misspent The travellers thought, and sighed, with grievous languishment. 33 A strand they reached, with waters sluggish, shallow, And strown with weed-grown walls where human mopes Reclined, while others idly 'gan to wallow In the dull wave: a realm of misanthropes It seemed, for none his neighbour told what hopes Or fears he had, or doubts or wishes: all Lugubrious silence kept, and drooped, as droops The brooding thing who doth his soul enthral With hates, till he thinks all men's veins, like his, hold gall. 34 Part of the dreary band with which I marched Clomb these dank walls, fording the shallow stream, And lay them vilely down; a remnant searched Along the beach for spot that they might deem More meet for resting-place: these, in my dream, I companied, until a bay they neared, From whence, discerned by an unearthly gleam Of lurid light, huge, half-sunk towers appeared,— And pinnacles their points from out the waters reared. 35 And here, methought, we halted, by a groupe Of ghosts that sat upon a ledge of rock Listlessly watching the gray ruins stoop Unto their fall among the waves that broke With leaden weight against their sides. None spoke A welcome, or unto our stay gave heed, But gazed still drowsily on. Within me woke Desire to know them; but, the soul, though freed From clay, on this dull shore seemed outward lore to need. 36 Here, spirit shared no powers intuitive: So gross it grew, that for old mortal sense The mind longed, painfully, when it would give Unto its neighbour mind some evidence That it still held its being: will, vehemence, Fire, energy, the soul no longer felt: Cold, carking consciousness of indigence Of thought—from waste with which it had misdealt Its goodly gifts on earth—within the spirit dwelt. 37 One of the listless groupe, at length, began To murmur sounds—for spirit was too weak, In this low realm, to beam forth thought, or scan The thoughts of others if they did not speak. And then another murmured, till apeak Each raised himself to listen; I, to learn Who spoke; when three, I saw by their antique Eagle-beaked faces, were of Rome the Eterne— Two of gay France—two of my fatherland more stern. 38 And by observance of a dull dispute That rose from murmurs to less slumberous words, I found out Nero's lewdly dissolute Comate, Sophonius, who, when Galba's guards Sought for his guilty life, forestalled their swords. The portrait of Sophonius Tigellinus,—who was distinguished in Nero's court alike for dissoluteness and treachery, and who, at last, betrayed even the imperial libertine himself,—is well known to all readers of Juvenal; and Tacitus has left us a medallion picture (Hist. lib. i., cap. 72) truly characteristic of his portable and expressive mintage. Here leant he, by the Tyrant's 'Arbiter ‘Of Elegancies’—whom the Muse records For polished verse—Ill Fame for panderer To Rome's imperial beast of lust and massacre. The circumstances of Petronius Arbiter's singular suicide are described in the 19th chapter of the 16th book of Tacitus's Annals. 39 That proverb with them state—the epicure Of epicures—he who through fear of want Destroyed the carcase he could not manure Sufficiently with garbage, from the scant Tenth of a million, which this cormorant From gormandizing spared. “Millies sestertiûm,” or 807,290l., is stated to have been the worth of the estate of Apicius; and when he had hanged himself in the diseased belief that he had not enough left for a maintenance, “centies sestertiûm,” or 80,000l., was found to be the remnant of his fortune.—In the stanza I have used the rhymer's license to employ round numbers. If these notes were intended for comment in lieu of necessary explication, I could not pass by the name Apicius without observing that the bearer of it fairly won his pre-eminence over all gormandisers ancient or modern, not merely by the vast sums spent on his appetite and by his self-martyrdom to the lunatic dread of want, —but by his composition of the treatise “de Arte Coquinaria,”— wherefrom, perhaps, even Eude himself might derive some hints for exciting dishes: though from Smollett's well-known satirical expose of the delicacies of Roman cookery, modern epicures may imagine there can be nothing very enticing in the treatise on Cookery by Apicius Cælius. Buffoon confest, Leant, by Apicius, the hair-brained Mordaunt, England's fine fool, all Europe's courtly guest, The general reader may find notices of the suicides of Mordaunt, cousin to the great earl of Peterborough, and of Lumley, earl of Scarborough, in various publications: the article “Suicide” con-tained in a translation of Voltaire's Philosophical Dictionary, that I read when young, first made me acquainted with their whimsical cases. Who paid his debts—then blew his brains out for a jest. 40 Lumley was there, a ‘noble lord,’in life, The general reader may find notices of the suicides of Mordaunt, cousin to the great earl of Peterborough, and of Lumley, earl of Scarborough, in various publications:the article “Suicide” contained in a translation of Voltaire's Philosophical Dictionary, that I read when young, first made me acquainted with their whimsical cases. Who his kept mistress to distraction loved, Yet, having pledged his troth to take for wife A lady chaste his thoughtful choice approved, Grew crazy with dilemma, till it moved His hand to solve the puzzle which his mind, Too delicately sensitive, behoved To solve. He seemed a lord of extinct kind. Certes, lords now no puzzle in such troth-pledge find! 41 Vatel, who cut his throat to shun the stain Of not being able sumptuously to store The supper-table for his guests; See Mad. de Sévigné's Letters for an account of this suicide. The English reader will find it in Letter 52 of the translation, published in 7 duodecimo vols., London, 1801. The account is too long to copy into a note; but should be read.with vain Villeneuve, Napoleon's admiral, who bore Disgrace so oddly that he flew to lore Of stern anatomy with aim to know— What he both learnt and practised—how the core Of life a pin may pierce, with one quick throe; Seeing that one account of his death is as mysterious as another (see “Biographie Universelle,” Vol. 49), it may be, after all, that O'Meara's account of it, as given by Napoleon, is as true as any other.— “The conversation then turned upon French naval officers. ‘Villeneuve’—said he, —‘when taken prisoner and brought to England, was so much grieved at his defeat, that he studied anatomy that he might destroy himself. For this purpose he bought some anatomical plates of the heart, and compared them with his own body, in order to ascertain the exact situation of that organ. On his arrival in France, I ordered that he should remain at Rennes, and not proceed to Paris. Villeneuve, afraid of being tried by a court martial for disobedience of orders and consequently losing the fleet, for I had ordered him not to sail, or to engage the English, determined to destroy himself, and accordingly took his plates of the heart and compared them with his breast. Exactly in the centre of the plate, he made a mark with a large pin, then fixed the pin as near as he could judge in the same spot in his own breast, shoved it in to the head, penetrated his heart, and expired. When the room was opened, he was found dead; the pin in his breast, and the mark in the plate corresponding with the wound in his breast. He need not have done it,’ —continued he,—‘as he was a brave man, though he possessed no talent.” —Barry O'Meara's “Voice from St. Helena,” vol. i., page 57. Two spirits truly French made up the groupe I saw. 42 Nero's two courtiers soon their contest ended; Apicius spoke not; and the mopes of France, With Lumley, on the rocks their shadows bended, As if o'ercome by that clime's heritance Of dullness, or because all esperance, They thought, was fled, for them, of happy change: But soon, Mordaunt upwaking from his trance, Gave utterance to his piebald musings strange: And thus did he his motley images arrange:— 43 “Petronius, though our mystic lot be placed In this dull realm where sight and sound combine Our sensories, for aye, to overcast With brooding phantasies, and saturnine Despairs; or, else, as with an anodyne Of thought, to lull us into listlessness; Let us, again, essay to intertwine Some shreds of brightness with the sombre dress Our spirits wear in this drear land, so effortless. 44 “Tell us some jest of old careering Rome, With its monstrosities of apish men, Who ever seemed desirous to become Something that was not human. What a den Of horror must thy prince have made it, when He lit it up to see a merry blaze! And yet, 'twas but a change: from outward ken Shut up, horrors as deep, in the foul ways O' the heart, were witnessed daily by man's inner gaze. 45 “What Europe's modern folds of rogues and fools Display, thy olden city must have shown; Strife murderous as the sword—but waged with tools Of deadlier kind: tongues venomed to impugn All humble virtues, oiled to gloss o'ergrown And hideous vice, and help it to pursue Its course of lust and blood. Thy prince hath won A name will never die: the lot of few Who humbly toil for good, and selfish wrong eschew. 46 “Such weaklings win but scorn; and so 'twas shrewd In thy magnifical incendiary To use a masterstroke should teach the brood Of puny things to come what 'twas to be Acute in wit; for no dexterity Of after-men can now the name destroy Of fiddling, murdering Nero—” “Cease thy glee!” Returned the Roman,—“or thy tongue employ “On themes that will thy hapless fellows less annoy. 47 “The prince thou slanderest had a noble soul, Although eccentric: hireling scribes defamed Him, or the world would his great deeds extol, Not censure. Man's advance he always aimed To hasten: wisdom, art, song, music claimed Him ever as their blandest, truest friend; And in the deed thou hast so lightly named, His purposes were princely: a quick end He put to ugliness that did with beauty blend: 48 “Filth-nests with palaces, that erst distilled Their feculent odours on the air, and spread Nausea and death. Thou shouldst have seen Rome filled With homes of stateliness and grace, instead Of mere mud-huts of squalor: 'twould have bred In thee much admiration——” My Ghost of Petronius Arbiter does not argue half so earnestly in defence of Nero, as Mr. Walter Savage Landor.—See his “Imaginary Conversations.” “And the roast,”— Resumed Mordaunt,—“was trifling: to the dead “Those who were burnt Decay would soon have tossed,— And Death, doubtless, preferred the speedier holocaust. 49 “Filth-nests! why, ay; and the mere wingless fowls— I'd term them such, did the old Cynic sneer, As in wise Plato's face, The practical joke of Diogenes upon Plato's definition of a Man, will be remembered by almost every reader. [“Not so,” say several of my friends. Here, then, is the whimsical anecdote which was in my memory: “Plato defining Man a two-footed animal without wings, and this definition being approved; Diogenes took a cock, and plucking off all its feathers, turned it into Plato's school, saying, This is Plato's Man: whereupon, to the definition was added, having broad nails.”—Stanley's Hist. of Philosophy.]—the dirty thralls Were of no worth. Besides, how vain it were Of the birds' filthy nests fair Rome to clear, And yet to leave the filth-birds! Thus, brave War Is the world's health's effectual pioneer, As well as burning: Earth, it doth not mar, But mend—to bruise it, now and then, with Slaughter's car.”— 50 “Spite of thy jeers,”—Villeneuve, inclined to wrath, Took up the strife, and said,—“War hath its use “As well as honours: harvest and aftermath Are rendered plenteous by the tide diffuse Of blood: the vulture's leavings do conduce, As well, to fertilize the barren earth, Which might, but for the timely stream let loose On it, become one general mass of dearth, Nor yield another grain for things of human birth. 51 “Thus doth the carnage of the field assist Great Providence. Nay, more: the lord of fight Is Nature's mightiest, best phlebotomist: 'Tis well that the fell falchion doth alight On thousands, and more slaughterous nitre blight Myriads of crawling things. What would the world Grow, but a putrid swarm, in the vast flight Of years, if oft the warrior's flag unfurled The sun saw not, nor smiled on crowds to swift death hurled? 52 “And, if Earth's youth the sword did not thus sweep Away by thousands, in what woe and want, What scorn and rags, would many of them creep To helpless age! But, next, the combatant Regard with Glory fired—” “Nay,”—said Mordaunt,— “Mar not thy theme; for thou hast pictured well The truest commendations War can vaunt: Slide not to farce: thou never wilt excel The argument, though tragic, we have heard thee tell. 53 “Such were the shameless reasonings of the Strong For murdering the Weak, I heard in life: And yet these very reasoners pale at wrong Wrought by the lone assassin with the knife: These very men whose arguments are rife Of aiding mystic Providence, by huge Assassination! That such hateful strife Of inconsistency we fled, I grudge Not, though it be for aye in this dull zone to lodge.”— 54 “And I judge otherwise,”—with lazy speech The suicidal glutton 'gan to break His moody silence: “could I old Earth reach “Again, at will, I quickly would forsake This clime that fits perception so opaque As thine. Why wonder at aught strange or mad They do or say on Earth? Do they not make A thing for worship that they say doth add To being but to slay what He with life hath clad? 55 “And justify they not His deathful laws By the same logic we have heard but now? ‘All things hath framed this great uncaused Cause,’ They say, ‘to prey upon each other, through ‘His blest design to save them from the slow ‘And lingering death of helpless age: and thus,’ Say they, ‘when men the universe of woe ‘And murder view, and shudder,—vision gross Leads them to term its kindly beauty—hideous.’ 56 “If such their model of perfection be, How canst thou wonder, if, with kindliness Like His to whom in awe they bow the knee, Their human slaughter-shapes they drape and dress? Mordaunt,—I ever laughed at answerless Priest-riddles, and unto the joys of sense And appetite betook me; and possess Them now I would, if this new residence Of being, and its laws, compelled not abstinence.” 57 “And as thou think'st, Apicius, so think I,”— Said dull Tigellinus;—“sense, and its joy, “But nought beside on earth, are worth a sigh: They rendered Life worth having, though alloy Was mingled with it: he who was least coy Of these true pleasures, was, in my esteem, The wisest man: ay, he who from a boy Led life of revel,-filling up his dream With merriment—daring the rapids of Life's stream. 58 “So judged I that our prince lived by the rule Of truest wisdom: could I once more share His favour and his joys, I would not pule At the world's contradictions, like this rare Sample of folly, who with haste so yare Fled hither from wealth's, pleasure's lavishment, In quest of dark remediless despair. Rome knew not such a lunatic: content We were to live,—'less ill with good was overblent.”— 59 “Ye may bepraise yourselves,”—Mordaunt replied; “But I regard ye as twin swine—to nought More noble are ye kin: not things of pride But filthiest greed ye be; and Earth o'erfraught With such as ye becomes the irksome spot It is, and hath been. Nature doth contain No greater mystery than that she with thought Such grovelling clay endows; the mystic chain Of mire with mind ye link: your life else is but vain.”— 60 “Is not our life—all life—as vain as theirs?” Asked Lumley,—while the Romans sank supine And slumbrous, on the rock:— “we were the heirs “Of Vanity on earth; and this confine Of wretchedness affords no cheering sign That we shall e'er attain a nobler state— Although some fable it who still entwine Earth's credulous dreams with doubt, and consolate This miserable life with emulous debate.”—— 61 “And what, if such debate high truths evolve We wot not of?”—earnestly asked Vatel: “My mind doth much misgive 'twas rash resolve, When ghost-kings messaged us, that did impel Our souls to scoff. If we have bid farewell To esperance ourselves”— “Nurse no regret So infantile,”—said Lumley:—“wisely quell “Its yearnings: ne'er can dreams in me beget A ray of hope that we shall 'scape from Torture's net. 62 “It is a universe designed for sorrow— Designed if it be; and if it rose by chance, 'Tis still as vile. I wish a vast death thorough All life would penetrate, until expanse Of space were filled with discontinuance Of thought, sense, motion. Worthless are they all, Serving no end but pain—the heritance Of all things: pleasure doth but serve to pall: 'Tis but a sweet to render bitterer Life's gall. 63 “Tell us Annihilation shall imbibe All life, and I thy prophecy will name Worthy rehearsal and regard: but gibe No dreams of some fantastic afterdrame Of blessedness for men and spirits: maim Their wits must be who doatingly desire For boon what we ought rather to disclaim And shun, judging from Past and Present: ire, Not joy, I feel, when told I shall new bliss acquire.”— 64 “Would that on earth physician for the mind Like to thyself I had discovered,”—said Vatel:—“thy morbid discontent and blind “Distortion even of joy, benignly spread With grief through Nature, into woe as dread As evil's self—creates so deep distaste By its untruth, that thou in me hast bred More reverence for the good in life amassed, Than if thou wert Nature's devout encomiast. 65 “Spirits,—within me hath awoke new hope, New faith! Even here we are not wholly lost: It is because in sluggard thought we mope And drivel, that we deem this mystic coast Our perdurable prison. Swiftly trust Shall rise to break our bondage, when no more We palter with ourselves, but with robust Resolve probe our life-errors to the core: Until, not Fate, but our own folly we abhor. 66 “Soon shall we then discover why we made Shipwreck of mortal life, and why we here, By turns, sink in low sloth, fiercely upbraid Nature herself, or agonise with Fear And Pain; and soon deliverance will appear: For Mind was formed all Evil to subdue By its own might”— “Old earth-dreams!”—with a sneer, Villeneuve exclaimed; “and let Earth still pursue “Her dreams: but, do not here the sickening theme renew. 67 “But who approacheth by the gloomy strand, With step of haste bounding o'er rock and level? Strange haste, in this supine, lethargic land! 'Tis he who did no earth so deeply revel In his dark theme of ‘Suicide no Evil,’— And, when the page was finished, finished life— Robert of Normandy, yclept the Devil.— Thy visage is a herald of new strife— Wild spirit! Speak the thoughts with which thy soul is rife!” 68 Already by the group, Le Diable Stood, with a look that seemed to reprehend Those sojourners in gloom—all, save Vatel,— Whose eyes of new-born hope a light I kenned, Of mystic sympathy and joy to send Forth as a greeting to the Norman's eyes. And thus the Norman spake:— “Spirits, attend “The invitation from the Good and Wise, That now I bring: attend, and from your sloth arise! 69 “Brothers, although their primal call ye slighted, Sages and bards and princely spirits yearn To kindle in your essences benighted. The fire of faith with which they inly burn. And, thus, by one who erst, ye know, with scorn Beheld life's gift, message they have renewed,— That ye may cease, when his soul's hope ye learn, And ken the faith with which he is imbued, To think they mock ye with a feigned solicitude. 70 “It is no dream: Hades and Earth are waking To consciousness of Mind's omnipotence. Not less unwise than guilty in forsaking Old Earth we were; for we with affluence Of might to subdue Evil's power prepense Were gifted: even the weakest might have won Some victory helpful to the prevalence Of Mind o'er Evil. But, it is begun— The lofty strife—and conquest shall be gained, full soon! 71 “I tell ye that on earth all natural ill Begins to yield to Science: Pestilence flees Her climes; and men shall soon begin to fill The expansive measure of their days. The seas Already own the power of Mind: with ease Men vault above the wave, fearing no rage Of giant storms. On land, the very breeze That vital is, they hold in vassalage, And yoke, by viewless chains, unto the thought-winged sledge. 72 “Mind glows and fulmines even in the clown; And men from yoke conventional and old Shake themselves free: the crosier and the crown, The sword and gun, all men begin to hold For useless and pernicious things, and bold The very peasants grow to laugh aloud At swollen names of gew-gaw shapes in gold. Think ye that changes such as these uncloud No change for Hades, and her kings and pomp-thrones proud? 73 “I tell ye Change hath come: judgment condign Hath fallen on the essences of kings Who raged to hear deep sage and bard divine Tell, in prophetic strain, pomp-glisterings Should pass away, and spirit homagings Be paid to Mind and Goodness. Where the bow Of promise skieth mystic symbolings Of monarch-splendour, forfeiture I saw Of thrones, which congregated ghost-kings shook with awe. 74 “Arise, arise, my brothers! we were wrong To quit Earth's life in craven discontent At Evil; and ignoble to prolong Our murmuring here it is. Evil was blent With Good through Nature; but the Blender meant To ennoble human thought by healthful toil That should have issue in magnificent And universal triumph. Brothers, foil The lethargy that doth your might-girt spirits spoil! 75 “Come, listen the inspiring theme of Good And Right, and how doth dawn their jubilee! Spirits, the universe one brotherhood Of Knowledge, Truth, and Love, full soon shall be! I say, arise!”— “Hence, with thy ribaldry!” Apicius fiercely answered: “of such fare “I covet not the taste. Hence, devotee Of dreams! To mock our abjectness forbear! Hence! let us slumber on to deaden our despair!”— 76 Thus spake his swinish spirit; nor arose His shade from its recumbency to greet The earnest messenger. In deeper doze Sophonius lay, as if he would maltreat The Norman with contempt. The rest with meet Attention heard; and, with a countless host The descant drew around, in haste more fleet Than they had used for ages on that coast, Expressed, as with one voice, their new-born hope and trust.— 77 “Then, to our brother exiles let us speed!”— The Norman said;—“But what shall be your fate— Victims of sensual gust? Is it decreed That Essences like yours in afterstate Of absolute brutality prostrate Shall lie for ever? Oh! that one bright ray From Nature's central fire would ye create Anew, with souls more human!”— And, away Faded my dream, as light renewed the prison-day. BOOK THE EIGHTH. 1 Unbidden visitors,—yet welcome,—tears Gush forth, while streams that dulcet melody— The tremulous, soft “Sicilian Mariners.”— Upon the evening air. How Love doth flee,— Winged by the thrill of organ minstrelsy So suddenly renewed within a gaol, The opening of an organ, in the gaol-chapel (which adjoined the “day-room” apportioned to me and my fellow-offenders), gave occasion to this and some of the following stanzas. In the scanty catalogue of prison-events, it was one, to me, too exciting to be passed by, either unfelt or uncommemorated. To visit the heart's home! Thoughts full of thee, My bosom's own,—so blest they banish bale For joy,—breathe from the tones of that heart-madrigal. 2 How wondrous is existence!—what strange ties It hath: what individable soul-links There be with formless sounds and harmonies The Mind, dulled by Life's grosser turmoil, thinks Extinct in power,—bereft of charm: how sinks My spirit into Rapture's lap, even now: Such ecstasy, in Thraldom's spite, Love drinks, By help of those sweet notes, from gentle flow Of Memory's streams, that Joy saith nought can bring back woe! 3 Hush! 'tis my infancy's quaint “Evening Hymn,” My mother's favourite! Tears! ye best can tell What thoughts the heart's deep fountains overbrim With tenderness when that loved choral swell Its potency o'er memory sways. A knell It seems;—and yet, a carol sweeter far Than mirth can troll. Lives in its strain a spell Which shews the grave that dear brave face doth mar, But ever shields that heart from the oppressor's war. 4 Hark! 'tis the grand “Old Hundredth” that now peals Its solemn glory through the trancëd soul! That matchless marshalry of chords reveals, Luther! thy free-born majesty: The evidence that the unequalled “Old Hundredth” is Martin Luther's composition may be questionable: I have yielded to the wish for having it regarded as his, in the stanza. they roll So boldly, gravely full,—that man's control, We feel, befits not the thewed mind upgrown Which germs such thought-sounds. Term ye me a thrall? How, then, upwakes the Saxon with each tone, Within me? Nay, I feel true freedom still my own! 5 Vain are your fetters, tyrants, for the mind! Thy championship, brave stripling, proved them vain, What time thou didst so fearlessly unbind Old Europe from the triple tyrant's chain,— Enthroning Reason the soul's suzerain: Reason the judge o' the book. True warrior For all men's right to think unawed by man, What though mirk Superstition on the shore Of Mind still lingers? She shall raise her throne no more. 6 Thy enterprise is speeding, and hath sped. I care not that thou didst not comprehend Its ultimate: it may be, wholesome dread Of wild excess Nature doth sagely blend With courage in great souls; and, that the end Of noblest change must gradually be sought, And Reason's heroes with Mind's foes contend From step to step,—yea, victory for Thought By years of struggling toil be stably, fully wrought. 7 I care not though some weaknesses were thine. Who shares thy giant strength? None but the high And mighty mental lineage who divine, From age to age, the ground whereon to ply At vantage their souls' sinews, and rely On their own strength in truth for victory. Thou art our own, great Saxon! we descry Our brave old Wickliffe's soul restored in thee; And claim thee for our honoured land of Lollardy! 8 Honour, all honour to ye, glorious band Who broke the bondage of the Priest of Rome! Sires of our common Saxon fatherland, England and Germany, a glorious home Ye left us,—if we will!—amid the gloom ‘Lighting a candle’ by your noble lives And martyred deaths that, quenchless, shall illume Our land for aye! Oh, that death—vaunt still gives Us strength; and with it, brave one, thy great deed revives! “Play the man, Master Ridley: we shall this day light up a candle that will never be extinguished in England!”—Latimer's words to his fellow-martyr at the stake. 9 What though those words, like oracles of old, Were sealed, in their full meaning, to the seer Who uttered them? The future shall behold Their splendid verity, with vision clear! Then—honour to each stalwart pioneer Of mental Freedom,—Wickliffe, Jerome, Huss, Luther, Melancthon, Cobham, Latimer! Honour to all who dared the flame, scorn, loss,— Who spurned to live mere spirit-thralls inglorious! 10 O thrice-blest children of that age of light And love, which now from the far future beams! To you it will pertain to place aright In Truth's great temple whom herself esteems Her true disciples. Ye, when Time's dim dreams And weakling fears are fled, and Knowledge pure Hath given the topstone to Truth's fane,—like gems In gold, shall place each dazzling form secure In its eternal niche. Our hands were premature! 11 But, when the toil of Mind hath wrought its aim; When later Faiths, like older Phantasies, Are reckoned with the Past; when Man's high name His grandest title is; when things of lies And bloodshed,—thrones and altars,—creeds, and toys Of Priests and Kings,—Knowledge hath swept away; When Wisdom hath outgrown the childish guise Of mythic story, and put on the array Of manhood; in that boon, free, happy, brother-day,— 12 It may be—that, in Truth's eternal fane Enshrined, each in his kindred niche of glory, He quaintly termed ‘rebellious needleman,’ I quote from Mr.Carlyle's magnificent unrhymed, unmetred Epic:—“Nor is our England without her missionaries. She has her Paine: rebellious staymaker; unkempt; who feels that he, a single Needleman, did by his ”Common Sense’ Pamphlet, free America;—that he can and will free all this world; perhaps even the other.”—“The French Revolution: a History:” vol. 2, chap. iii. By thee, great age-fellow!—with martyr gory, Or some old stout confessor of faith hoary, May stand, as right co-workers, equal, true, For Truth; although the world's old bigot-story Of Man's mind-infancy did long misview The scope of their twin-toil: scope that themselves scarce knew! 13 It may be that, around that temple's space, Splendours may wreathe full many a doubter's brow As brilliantly as they illume the face Of philanthropic creed's-man. 'Mid the glow Of sculptured excellence, in shining row, Herbert of Cherbury, Hobbes, with Locke and Boyle— Hume, Godwin, may, with Paley and Butler, show— Statued with equal honour in Truth's aisle— Lit with one ray—how truly kindred was their toil! 14 Spinoza and Rousseau, Bayle and Voltaire, With Fenelon, Erasmus, Pascal, shrined— May beam in brotherhood eternal there!— But, for thy future children doth the mind Most fondly yearn, loved fatherland! and find Its sweetest dreams flow thence. O that some dream Would visit me revealing humankind As the far future shall discover them— Living as they shall live on this loved ocean-gem! 15 What Howard, when the dungeon is forgot; What Montague, when no man's blood is shed; What Hale, when justice can be no more bought; What Bernard Gilpin, when no poor lack bread; What Cartwright, when no tyrants on them tread; What Clarkson, when the world hath not a slave; What Owen, when free thought awakes no dread; What Mathew, when there is no sot to save; What men shall grace our isles when Wrong hath found its grave? 16 O thrice blest children of that age of light And love which now the trustful spirit sees, Bright beaming from afar—Ye will not slight Your noblest fathers, nor their memories! But, tombing names of blood and pride that please The human patient, whom to drug and craze Guile, long, with Power, hath striven—Ye to sweet ease Of health, in heart and mind, restored shall raise, With filial hands, true trophies to your fathers' praise! 17 Bourse of the world wilt thou be, London, then? For still I turn with fondness to thy face, And doat upon thee—though I, mournful, ken Too many a blemish there! Wilt thou a grace Be, then, among Earth's cities? Or, shall race Arrive from some far clime, new emigrants To found a home, and find thy desart-space Renewed, my country!—howling forest-haunts And wilds “peopled with wolves thy old inhabitants?” “Peopled with wolves thy old inhabitants.”—Pt. ii. of Hen. 4. The quotation was tempting—for a rhyme; but I almost feel as if I had committed a mortal sin in thus literalising, in its application, Shakspere's sublime and sinewy figure. 18 Shall Gain forsake thy marts, great queen of Thames? Thy merchant-navies vanish?—and, where Pride In famine-woven silks and blood-bought gems, Now rolls her chariot, shall Decay divide Empire with Silence,—there the lizard glide 'Mong crumbling walls,—and there the badger peep Forth from sere weeds that half his gray head hide, Save when uplifted by the winds that sweep 'Mong chambers where thy pampered lords no longer sleep? 19 Or, shall true grandeur deck thee: bounding joy Of human hearts feeling their fathers' home— That happy home—renewed, and thee the Eye Become of the wide world? Gaol, ‘Bastile’-doom, Treadmill, whip, gallows, demon War's costume, And all his trophies and his engines gone: No Vileness robed—no Worth in rags; Health's bloom On cheek of sturdy sire and manly son, Proving what secrets Science hath from Nature won: 20 Mind writ in every face; books million-fold Increased; and galleries vast with breath-shapes hung Raffaelle might worship, or Apelles old; Groupes from great Shakspere's world, or Chaucer's song, In bronzed or marbled life, seeming up-sprung From some new Phidian realm of earth beneath To gem the populous squares; Music's full tongue Telling to millions what Mozart in death Enraptured heard, but could not the boon-sounds bequeath; Mozart's last words—“Now I begin to see what might be done in music!” 21 And all—for ALL! Rank, class, distinction-badge, For ever gone! Labour by Science made Brief recreation—not by Privilege Avoided, nor its thrift in name of Trade Or Commerce filched. To give a brother's aid To brethren, and enlarge the general bliss From knowledge, virtue, health—beyond parade Of pomp or gold—affording joy. I wis, When Truth doth reign, Earth shall be such a Paradise! — 22 Do I reharp like themes? Perchance, the gaol Doth stagnate thought. And now the blythe old man Is gone, who joked, and told his merry tale Each morning when the prison-day began,— Who spread instruction through the hours' long span, Mingling the grave and gay with cheery tongue. O how I miss the septuagenarian! My venerable fellow-“conspirator” and fellow-prisoner (for the first year) John Richards, whose seventy-first birthday occurred on the first Christmas-day we passed in the gaol. I wonder what hath kept his heart so young, That still he dreams to live and see the end of Wrong! 23 Gone, are my younger fellow-rebels all, To bustle, once more, with Life's elbowing crowd; And I am left, a solitary thrall, Where stillness like the silence of the shroud Pervades both night and day, save when aloud Clash bolts and bars, and the shrill curfew tells The prisoner must to bed.— The vision glowed Again in sleep; and, where the spirit dwells I seemed to dwell,—the spirit that its own Life quells. 24 A sense of loneliness, methought, I felt, When from beneath the dome, again, I passed, And wandered over mountains where none dwelt, But doleful voices from the howling blast, Cowed the lone spirit, while gloom-clouds o'ercast The dull gray sky. Anon, the way descended Into a darksome clough, where antre vast, With jaggëd mouth, the dern, dark pathway ended, And with its lowering brow some gloomier change portended. 25 I entered, but trod timidly the rock That echoed hollowly my steps of fear; And oft I halted, hearing voices mock And chide my rashness for o'erventuring there; Till, when I turned, thinking the cavern drear And its unproven perils I would flee, It seemed as if dank vapours rose to blear My vision; and, forthwith, they fell on me With noisome blight, till I was blinded utterly. 26 Chilled unto marble horror with the sense That I was blind, I would have shrieked, but, lo! The will had lost its wonted prevalence O'er faculty or organ; and with throe Unutterable I sank, feeling my woe Too grievous to be borne. But, as I fell, I ceased to grieve, feeling new might endow My spirit—might to picture or to tell I ken not, 'twas so wildly indescribable. 27 Onward I floated—for no joint or limb I seemed to need—into a region dark Beyond all thought: Earth's midnight is but dim. Compared with the primeval blackness stark And stript even of minutest atomed spark Of light my new intelligence perceived In this strange clime. I, its stern shapes to mark Seemed thence empowered that I was now bereaved Of grosser sight, and with new eyes that soul-realm cleaved: 28 Eyes most intensely vision-rich that cleft The dread opaque gleefully as young eyes On earth view brightest stars in the blue weft Above; or lustrous gem-shells scrutinize In fountains pellucid, then grasp the prize, At jeopardy of life. Yet, I beheld Emblems of mortal gloom and miseries, Much more than joy: but in them was revealed Grace so transcendent that the mind with rapture swelled 29 To feel its essence gifted with the power Of viewing in thick darkness shapes of grace And beauty so unspeakable. Meteor, On marish seen, or victims' burial-place,— Phantasmagoric slights, where figures chase Each other in illusive vision wild,— Spectrous deceits the human eye doth trace, By brain-sick fancy or shrewd art beguiled,— All fail to explicate how mystic mind was filled 30 With sculptured forms in darkness, and rich hues Of pictures crowded on her rapid glance.— First, statue-groupes arose that did suffuse The soul with Love's woe-tears:—Orpheus' joy-trance At his Eurydice's deliverance— Quick changed to pain and horror, as he turned— Alas, too soon! ill brooking tarriance Of looks—lips—clasped embrace: the bliss-cup earned In vain—to atoms dashed—by Love's own madness spurned! 31 Then, Galatea, with her shepherd love, Was statued, breathing joy, quick chased by pain; For o'er them bent the Cyclop, ire enwove In his grim glance; and wildly o'er her swain The sea-nymph writhed when she beheld him slain. Soon, seemed Leander, struggling with the wave In death, and Hero leaping in disdain Of life, with haste into her watery grave.— Then, images of grief and fate the darkness clave: 32 The Carian queen,—in that fair monument She built for her loved spouse, and which the world Proclaimed a wonder—o'er the dead was bent; And he who sung how the great Titan hurled Defiance back at Jove,—stricken, brain-whirled, Fell, as the tortoise from the eagle's beak Dropped on his head,—the oracle upfurled In mystery accomplishing. The Greek Sublime, pitying his slanderers, and with courage meek 33 Drinking the hemlock, while in aching grief His friends stood round, then passed; and, next, rose two Sad images depicturing man's poor, brief Mirth-hour on earth: Pollio's fair child, that drew Its earliest breath in laughter, but scarce knew Life ere in death it faded; and the stern And melancholy Agelastus, who Ne'er laughed but once, and then, in Cynic scorn, To see the thistles by the ass for lettuce torn. Cicero, Pliny, and others commemorate the grandfather of Crassus, surnamed ??ge/lastos, who never laughed but once,—namely, —when he saw an ass eat thistles, and then his exclamation was, “Similes habent labra lactucas,”—Like lips like lettuces. 34 Then rose twin corpses of the craftsmen sage The Pythian's oracle that deftly reared,— With Juno's priestess' duteous lineage Who drew their mother to the fane: reward Of death, as the best gift, on each conferred By the high deities, for wondrous skill And filial piety. The stories of Agamedes and Trophonius, architects of the vestibule to the temple of Delphi,—and of Biton and Cleobis, sons of Cydippe, priestess of Juno at Argos,—are told by Plutarch, in his Morals. Countless appeared The sculptured shapes, thereafter, that did still Pourtray grief, fate, life's swiftness, and all human ill. 35 Praxiteles, his mirror seemed to dash To living fragments which a thousand-fold Showed his deformed rude visage to the rash Enraged destroyer: Hoar, in gloomy hold Trophonius sat: young Phaëthon the bold Fell from the chariot-sun: vortex and rock By vexed Messina's shore, worn voyagers old Seemed toiling to escape,—yet swiftly broke The billows o'er them, and they bowed beneath Death's stroke. 36 And while these semblances I, wondering, saw, With thousands more, mysterious music streamed Upon my soul, refreshingly as blow The evening gusts on toiling swains condemned To reap all day, whilome the sun hath beamed His fiercest fires: blythely their hook they ply To win substantial good; yet, when redeemed From overheats, breathe joyously:—so I, With sense of ease, listed the soothing minstrelsy. 37 And soothing 'twas, though sad: a wildering strain Unearthly,—or, if like to aught on earth Most like that theme which breathes her spirit's pain— The ‘Mater dolorosa’ Pergolesi's Stabat Mater (I never heard Rossini's) is the “theme” to which I allude. I never heard it performed but once; yet its pathetic power left an indelible impression on my memory.—with such birth Of sweetness, that, once heard, we deem thenceforth, Grief-music thrills more deep deliciousness,— Ay, more essential joy,—than strains of mirth! Most like that voice of rapturous soul-distress It was; and, wordless, seemed these woe-thoughts to express: 38 ‘Oh! what shall quell Life's universal sorrow? ‘In Hades' realm of darkness, drear and deep ‘As Death's, or where gloom-prison Earth doth borrow ‘Light from the gaudy sun, all creatures weep, ‘All spirits ache! Duration on doth sweep, ‘Bringing no other change than newer woe! ‘Oh! that this waking to eternal sleep ‘Might change, and spirits cease to think and know: ‘For ever quenched Life's inward like its outer glow! 39 ‘Oh! what is youthful Love?—a torturous dream: ‘What conjugal affection?—pain and tears: ‘What Life?—capricious gift of Powers supreme ‘That mock Man's hopes, and laugh at his weak fears: ‘Hath Virtue a reward?—the wicked's sneers: ‘Hath Bliss existence?—in the realm of Nought: ‘Can Fate be shunned?—when Essence disappears; ‘But all in Hades or on Earth who thought ‘And life inherit in her web of woe are wrought. 40 ‘Spirits, look onward!—what do ye perceive? ‘Woe-thought to come—a future filled with gloom— ‘Ages in which your essence still shall grieve ‘That it exists, and long for instant doom ‘Of blank annihilation. Your old home ‘Look back upon! What is Man's journey thorough ‘Earth's life? Grief from the cradle to the tomb— ‘Toil-thought for bread to-day—a shroud to-morrow: ‘Oh, what shall quell, for aye, Life's universal sorrow?’ 41 The enraptured anguish of my spirit ceased, For now this minstrelsy I heard no more; And every sculptured emblem, which a feast Of visioned wonderment had set before The soul's interior self, evanished. Roar Of multitudinous voices came, and crowd On crowd of Sorrow's suicides the shore Of Darkness, in desponding phalanx, trode, Wailing they could not 'scape Life's ever-during load. 42 By thousands, the stern, giant Cimbri trooped,— And Xanthians and Saguntines,—they who fled, In olden times, from life, by act abrupt, Rather than wear the conqueror's yoke. That dread And sullen band of Jews who undismayed, In old cathedralled York, by their own hand Met death, to shun the fiendish vengeance spread For their rackt tribe, The suicidal massacre of the Jews of York, to escape from the horrid persecution of the Christian citizens; on the IIth of March, 1189, is related at considerable length (from Roger Hoveden, Matthew Paris, and William Newburgh), by Drake, in his Hist. and Antiq. of York; Book I, chap. iv. stalked by on Darkness' strand.— 'Twere long to tell the Sorrow-crowds my spirit scanned:— 43 Of every age, and every mortal clime They were; and 'twas appalling their array To view, and think of nations choosing crime Of suicide,—hasting themselves to slay, Rather than be their butcherous brethren's prey!— The multitudes had passed, and a slow river Methought I reached, upon whose banks a gray And solemn man whose every nerve did quiver With woe, walked, murmuring at existence and the Giver. 44 And him there met the noble Roman,—made A rightful heritor of lasting fame By matchless Tully's friendship,—though such aid His own high sense and virtues might disclaim— Were it not native to the sovereign flame Of genius, like the sun, to render gleam Of lesser lustres dull, and give a name, Even to brightest things, less for their beam Inherent, than the ray lent by its fire supreme.— 45 “Pomponius, hail!”—began the solemn sire;— “Thee have I longed to meet in this demesne Of mystic darkness,—for until I tire To loathing, have I walked with ghosts obscene, Listening their threadbare tales of vulgar teen. Friend of Rome's noblest tongue and largest mind,— Thee, calm Philosophy with thought serene To bear unmoved the common woes assigned To man, must have endowed: what subtle woe was joined 46 “Unto thy soul on earth, that thou its coil Shook off? Could loftiest friendship, wealth, and ease, With joys refined, thee fail to reconcile To life? O Atticus, while I had these,— While on my peace no feminine fiend did seize, Dishonouring my children, and my own Hoar age covering with shame, The brief account of M. de Pontalba, and his suicide, in Winslow's “Anatomy of Suicide,” is so absorbingly, horrifically interesting that I transcribe it:— “M. de Pontalba was one of the great proprietors of France. His son had been a page of Napoleon's and afterwards a distinguished officer, aide-de-camp to Marshal Ney, and a protégé of the Duke of Elchingen. He married the daughter of Madame d' Almonaster, and for some time they lived happily; but on the death of her mother, Madame de Pontalba began to indulge in such extravagances that even the enormous fortune of the Pontalbas was unequal to it. This led to some remonstrance on the part of her husband, on the morning after which she disappeared from the hotel, and neither he nor his children had any clue to her retreat. At last, after an interval of some months, a letter arrived from her to her husband, dated New Orleans, in which she announced that she meant to apply for a divorce; but for eighteen months nothing more was heard of her, except by her drafts for money. At last she returned, but only to afflict her family. Her son was at the Military Academy of St. Cyr. She induced him to elope, and the boy was plunged in every species of debauchery and expense. This afflicted, in the deepest manner, his grandfather, who revoked a bequest he had made him of about 4,000l. a year, and seemed to apprehend from him nothing but future ruin and disgrace. The old man, eighty-two years of age, resided in his chateau of Mont Levéque, whither, in October, 1834. Madame de Pontalba went to attempt a reconciliation with the wealthy senior. The day after her arrival she found she could make no impression on her father-in-law, and was about to return to Paris, when old M. de Pontalba, observing a moment when she was alone in her apartment, entered it with a brace of double-barrelled pistols, locked the door, and, approaching his astonished daughter-in-law, desired her to recommend herself to God, for that she had but few minutes to live; but he did not even allow her one minute—he fired immediately, and two balls entered her left breast. She started up and fled to a closet, her blood streaming about, and exclaiming that she would submit to any terms, if he would spare her.— ‘No, no! You must die!’ he exclaimed, and fired his second pistol. She had instinctively covered her heart with her hand; the hand was miserably fractured by the balls, but it saved her heart. She then escaped to another closet, where a third shot was fired at her without effect; and at last she rushed in despair to the door, and while M. de Pontalba was discharging his last barrel at her, she succeeded in opening it. The family, alarmed by the firing, arrived, and she was saved. The old man, on seeing that she was beyond his reach, returned to his apartment, and blew out his brains. It seemed clear that he had resolved to make a sacrifice of the short remnant of his own life, in order to release his son and his grandson from their unfortunate connexion with Madame de Pontalba. But he failed—none of her wounds were mortal; and within a month after, Madame de Pontalba, perfectly recovered, in high health and spirits, radiant, and crowned with flowers, was to be seen at all the fêtes and concerts of the capital.” —Pp. 292—294—a gift to please I found Earth's life,—not that insipid boon Which some proclaim it, ere the mortal scene they shun. 47 “But thou hadst no soul-harrowing shame to meet In every neighbour's eye: men did not point At thee the finger,—and, anon, repeat The damning whisper, or the subtle hint, Wherever thou wert seen. What mystic dint Invisible of Sorrow's sting could pierce Thy heart,—and make the world seem so disjoint That thou must flee it, hither to immerse Thy soul in gloom? Roman, where lay thy life's fell curse? 48 “Pontalba!—for thy sorrow-notes reveal Too truly, reverend mourner, who thou art”— The thoughtful Roman answered:—z“to unseal “My secret I will haste. Within the heart I ever wore this canker: that depart I must, or late, or soon,—must yield my breath, Unknowing of what joy or aftersmart The soul inherits in the realm of Death,— Or whether he the spirit's flame extinguisheth. 49 “Strong pain corporeal hurried me to take My fatal step more early than, perchance, I, otherwise, had sped from Life's heart-ache: Yet, ease returned, long ere the severance Was made 'tween clay and spirit: but, the advance Begun towards Death, retreat more terrible Appeared than forward march; It is a well-known relation that when Pomponius Atticus (the friend of Cicero) had subdued a fever by fasting, or medicine, in his 77th year, he refused to take food, from an unwillingness to prolong life. —the sustenance Of Life's huge load, a second time!—the spell Half-broken to repair!—farewell, and yet farewell!— 50 “I could not face such horror, for I knew That I should hourly see my funeral urn, And that more bitterly it would imbue Life's joy with sorrow, if I should return When I had well-nigh reached the portal stern. Oh, tell me, mourning sire,—if Death with thee Was not the great Smile-queller: the thought borne For ever uppermost, that strangled Glee Even in its birth,—or made its breath an agony!” 51 “I know not that it was,”—the sire replied: “It is my nation's habit to avert Despondency of thought in the gay tide Of revelry; and when to share the sport Men cease, by age enfeebled, they resort Still to the scene of mirth, to dissipate Dull thoughts by seeing sprightly youth exert Its agile limbs or jocund wit: sires sate Their minds beholding sons their spirits recreate.”— 52 “Thy answer seemeth strange,”—the Roman said: “To me, beholding what I could not share For ever multiplied the heart's dim dread Of the approaching tomb: joys of the fair And young ceased to be gladsome: for the glare O' the funeral torch gleamed on my mental sight. Death—Death—was present with me everywhere, Smirching the face of Nature with his blight, Bereaving the warm heart of solace or delight.”— 53 “But why didst thou not mingle in the strife Of public act or counsel?”—asked the soul Of the gray Gallic sire;—“for thee Earth's life Had countless remedies for this strange dole. Oh! had thy lot beneath the restless rule Of him who swayed my fatherland been cast, The fever of the times had warmed thy cool O'er-meditative brain, until Death's vast Reality had quelled the Shade whose slave thou wast.”— 54 “Thou speakest, Spirit, as if strifeful Rome Were some Arcadian grove,”—replied the ghost Of Atticus;—“albeit, within her womb “Myriads with greed of fame or gold engrossed, Resembled some insatiate wolvish host— Ever in open cry for prey. In fear Of its heart-tortures, public care I thrust Far from me; nor discern I, in this drear Gloom-region, that its slaves than I aught happier were. 55 “Pontalba! for man's soul no genuine good There is: no state enfranchiseth the mind From tyranny of Evil's monster brood. If in society men strive to find Relief from megrim dullness,—'mong their kind They soon engender hate, even without Design, and wish they never had repined At solitude, although with dread or doubt They wrestled till compelled to shun their own lone thought. 56 “And what sayst thou of thine own fitful race? Life's pulse beats not less healthfully in the veins Of the most feverous tenants of Earth's space Than it doth beat in theirs. Pleasures to pains, By very eagerness, they turn: each drains The joy-cup of the hour as if the world Had not another for his draught. Contains Not this woe-clime,—whom Pleasure's zest braindirled,— Legions, from thy own land by mad self-murder hurled? 57 “There is no human state exempt from woe. If the lone thinker with a dread profound Of death be haunted,—they who love the show And strife of crowds carry within some wound From rival or proud tyrant who hath frowned Upon their peace; and if dull solitude Be irksome,—Pleasure's gay and guilty round As surely leads to madness. 'Tis a crude Abortion of a world; and Mind must be at feud 58 “For ever with the Powers to whom it owes Existence—if volition they possess; And if Necessity all Essence bows Beneath its sceptre, at our wretchedness We cannot but repine.”— “Whence this excess Of perverse discontent?”—a voice began:— And lo! a crowded audience bodiless I saw,—while through the host this murmur ran— ‘Meek Menedemus hear—the sage Eretrian!’ Menedemus is another of the suicides of antiquity who are described as escaping from life by refusing food. False accusation of treason is stated to have been the desperate provocative with this Socratic philosopher of Eretria. 59 “Whence this excess of perverse discontent?”— The sage repeated:—“dost thou, then, forget, “Illustrious Roman! thy so late assent To consolable thoughts, when thee I met Nursing, as now, this vain, unwise regret? Alas, we all are too much prone to cling To sorrow in this clime, and think our debt To justice never will be paid. Yet spring High hopes within me—thoughts of rescue heralding! 60 “O Atticus, I grieve that we the call Fraternal of imperial spirits slighted, Nor joined their descant in the mystic hall: Yet, in their souls on whom hope hath alighted, For Sorrows' host in dreary realm benighted, Compassion may be felt, till they renew Their invitation. Not for ever blighted, Brothers, is this our essence: hopes congrue With deep discursive reason thus my mind to thew: 61 “It is not by unalterable law That Evil's tyranny Man's spirit quelleth: Brothers, in us, in all, a might to awe The moral curse o' the universe indwelleth. O when the sheen of Brotherhood unveileth Its glory, how our happy race will ponder And muse upon the Past, until it faileth Their souls to tell—for ecstasy of wonder— What first could rend Man's heart from brother-men asunder! 62 “When selfishness, by Love and Truth dispelled From human spirits, ceaseth to mislead With falsest sense of interest,—and 'tis held A fiction foul that Nature hath decreed Man only can be moved to generous deed Of enterprise by personal reward; When Brotherhood returns, and hearts do feed On richest bliss, toiling in disregard Of self, and viewing their toil's fruit by brethren shared: 63 “When Strength and Health their happiness derive From knowledge that the produce of their toil Is shared by Feebleness and Age; when live The men of Mind to kindle a heart-smile Where'er they move,—disdaining to defile Their names with titles, or their hands with gold, And yearning every moment to beguile Mankind to deeds of love and goodness bold, Until the sun a world of mercy doth behold; 64 “Think ye that then the curse of Evil's reign Mankind shall know? Suffering will disappear; For love and sympathy shall vanquish pain, And gentlest pity shall the lorn heart cheer Till sorrow's stream for joy's abounding tear Is changed. 'Twill be a holy, gladsome scene— Too holy for mad Pleasure to be there! A world of Love and Truth and Peace serene— A world of brother-hearts, whose joys are evergreen! 65 “A world in which thy Death-fear, noble one! Can no more haunt the soul. Who will fear Death When, with fraternal love Man's course begun, Hath been continued? When to yield his breath The hour is come, with this exalted faith In gladness Man can die—‘A world I leave ‘Of happy brothers!—love fraternal hath ‘Increased my bliss; and after-hearts shall cleave ‘To me through time, and with their songs my memory weave! 66 “‘And if our thought surviveth mortal clay ‘My loving spirit for a world of love ‘Is fitted: if I think no more,—decay ‘Itself is welcome; since around, above, ‘Bliss, still progressing, is with Essence wove; ‘And men, succeeding men, shall still proclaim ‘The bliss is but begun!’—Thus men shall prove Superior to death-dread, on earth: the flame Of Brother-love, 'bove selfish fears exalting them!”— 67 With visages of hope the mystic crowd Stood, in expressive silence, as the soul Of Menedemus ceased. Then, one who glowed With nobler thought than when the venomed bowl, To 'scape from hated Rome's renewed control, He, fearing vengeance, in fair Capua took,— Rash Vibius Virius, Livy (lib. 26, caps. 13, 14) tells how Vibius Virius advised the Capuans to revolt to Hannibal, and, when the city was retaken by the Romans, took poison to escape the vengeance of the victors. thus began to extol The good Eretrian's theme:— “Forbear rebuke, Meek sage!—but, henceforth, we this gloom shall hardly brook: 68 “For who can list thee tell of blooming bliss, And brother-love for ever verdurous, Nor long to quit a dreary clime like this? 'Tween Earth and Hades link mysterious We inly feel; and bliss analogous To Earth's shall surely be our heritage:— Yet, till kings cease their feuds calamitous, And nations wear no more the conqueror's badge, Dost thou not dream—this reign of Mercy to presage? 69 “And, until monarch-spirits, in our clime, Disown their lofty claims, what can make known, By mystic sign, in penal land of crime, That Hades' crowds shall soon behold begun The reign of Brotherhood? O that the boon Were near!—” “Behold who cometh!” cried the host; “The spirit of thy friend, illustrious one!— The friend o' the bards most noble and robust Of thy great land,—Varus, Quintilius Varus: I have, for the sake of introducing another character, asserted what is merely probable,—from Horace de Arte Poetica (438) the 8th Ode of Book I, and also the 24th. It is more generally believed that Q. Varus the poet, and Q. Varus the commander of Roman armies in Gaul, who slew himself because overcome by the craft of Arminius, were different persons.—the thoughtful herald-ghost!”— 70 “Hail, Atticus! r=italic—the herald cried,—“ and ye “Grief-brothers, who still nurse, in gloomiest land, Your sorrow! Once again, high destiny Of human spirits to search out, the band Of heroes, sages, bards, and kings, divanned In emblematic grandeur, ye conjure To lend your aid! Brothers, full soon the brand Of slavery shall, on earth, be known no more! Brothers, full soon bliss shall pervade this climature! 71 “Take hope—take heart! Monarchs, themselves, display Zeal for equality and brotherhood!— O haste to leave your gloom, and, swift, away Pursue with me your spirit-course, the Good And Great to join in converse!”— Like a flood Of rapture burst the choral song—‘We come!’ From myriads hope-inspired;—and ere I viewed From darkness their departure, out of gloom I passed—woke by that thrilling song's exordium. BOOK THE NINTH. 1 'Tis Woman's voice!—woman in wailful grief, Joined by her babe's scarce conscious sympathy. Thy wife hath come to take her farewell brief, Gaunt felon!—brief and bitter must it be For thy babe's mother, since the wide salt sea Must roll, for life, its deep, dark gulph between Thee, convict, and that form of agony! Poor wretched thing! well may she wail, I ween, And wring her hands, and wish that she had never been. 2 ‘Let me have one last kiss of my poor babe!’ He saith, and clingeth to the grate. Oh! how The turnkey's answer will his bosom stab! ‘Away!—we open not the bars!’—and, lo! They push him rudely back!—he may not know What baleful bliss it gives to clasp a child Or wife, ere one must yield them to life's woe. Ah! little had that kiss his grief beguiled; But, rather, filled his soul with after-throes more wild. 3 She fainteth!—yet awakes to moan and weep! How little didst thou think that smiling morn Thou didst, so early and so eager, peep Into thy mirror, and thy breast adorn With virgin-rose, so soon the sorrow-thorn Would there have pierced!—that thou, in two short years, Wouldst see thy husband in that dress of scorn: And turn, a widowed bride—a thing of tears— From that stern grate, forlorn, to meet the world's rude jeers! 4 Poor sufferer! how wilt thou the future brook! To drudge from morn to eve, for beggar's bread; To hear thy ragged child receive rebuke For his sire's sins, that on the exile's head Already fall full sore; to see him shed Tears when he asks for food, and thou hast none To stop his hunger; then, to make thy bed With him upon the heath or moorland lone,— Unless, for infamy, thou takest the rich man's boon! 5 What misery, hadst thou never been a bride, Thy heart had shunned! Yet, thou wilt fondly cling Unto the memory of thy love, nor chide, Even by a thought, in deepest suffering, His error, who did thy young joy-bloom bring To desolation! Ill-requited love Was thine, even from the bridal-revelling; Yet, thou forgavest all, nor didst reprove The wild excess which oft thee nigh to madness drove.— 6 O Woman! how thy truest worth is slighted; Thy tenderness how often met with hate; Thy fondest, purest hopes, how often blighted; How Man, the tyrant, lords it o'er thy fate, Yet feigns for thy benign behests to wait; How jealously he guards thy faithfulness, And frowns a censure on thy every state: Thy chastity terms coldness; thy caress Weak fooling, stratagem, or grosser love's excess! 7 O Woman! fairest, frailest, sweetest flower Of Nature's garden, what rude storms thee bend! Thy heart, thou priceless, peerless, matchless dower Of Nature's treasury, what keen sufferings rend! How meanly men, through selfishness, contend To pamper thee!—how silkenly their lays Of love they lisp to gain their guilty end; How sensually Man lauds thy beauty's blaze; How heartlessly deserts thee in its dimmer days! 8 O Woman! what anxieties destroy The bliss thou dreamest none can take away When hushing thy soft care—thy cradled joy! How Time the blessings thy fond hopes pourtray Oft turns to curses, and thy heart a prey To keenest woe condemns: maternal woe, That like maternal love, the human clay Moves more intensely than severest throe Or most ecstatic thrill that mortal bosoms know. 9 Mysterious bonds of Nature! can ye be Without a wise Deviser? Hath a blind Necessity, indeed, implanted ye? Are ye not proofs of All-pervasive Mind? Hath Goodness, then, these spirit-throes designed, Still mingled with the mother's cup of bliss? Wherefore, oh wherefore, still must mortals find Mystery ne'er lessen, but, for aye, increase Beneath their feeble search, or frail analysis?— 10 Ay, Woman!—for thy mother heart remain The keenest agonies: to see revealed Passions that do defy thee to restrain Their baneful germs, and which, thou knowst must yield A deadly fruit; to see thy young flower felled In its sweet promise; or to be bereft Of it by ruthless power that tyrants wield O'er Poverty; and, though thy heart be cleft With sorrowing, no sight of it to be vouchsafed! 11 ‘Thou pampered tyrant who dost crush the Poor! ‘Alien of Nature from thy mother's womb! ‘Who never sucked the breast of her that bore ‘Thy most unnatural self! Thou humoursome ‘Wealth-wanton, who dost send thy child from home, ‘Or callst a hireling, Life's sweet stream to give ‘Unto thy babe! What wonder that ye doom ‘The Poor to pain?—since in ye doth not live ‘A natural heart, how can ye Nature's pain perceive? 12 ‘Ye artificial things in blood and breath, “What human creatures feel how can ye tell?’— Tush! raving mother,—the rich wanton saith Thy pangs are feigned, and whipping should dispel Thy discontent! Oh! ye will wake the yell Of reckless vengefulness around ye yet, Tyrants! unless ye, timely, bid the knell Be tolled of dæmon-legislation!— Let Me strive that theme of rending heart-ache to forget!— 13 O Woman! what illustrious children thine Oft prove even when thy fate and theirs seems dark. Slave-mother of old Smyrna, who didst pine In grief, and in lorn hope thy babe embark On Meles' stream, cradled in that frail ark, How little didst thou dream thy infant's glory Would beam through Time; and he, the patriarch Of song become, all bards and sages hoary Transcend in honour, through the world, to latest story! 14 Or, if thy Homer, and the child on Nile, The ‘babe’ that ‘wept,’ but soon proud Pharaoh's might Defied, and led those thousands on their toil Through the drear wilderness, the Canaanite To dispossess,—if these, to read aright, Their story, Reason must as Myths regard— Fertile in moral, albeit overdight With marvel—Mothers in late times have reared Their sons in want, yet seen them win Fame's high reward. 15 How thy best children, Woman, testify A mother's worth,—attributing their zest For enterprize, or love of good, to thy Exalting nurture! O let him attest A mother's worth—that Titan of the West— Unequalled Washington! And if such men, That dwarf all kings, vigour from thy meek breast Now draw, Woman! what will thy sons be when Man looks on thee no longer with the tyrant's ken? 16 When chivalry's false homage is forgot; When eastern jealousy no more immures And renders thee a vernal idiot; When thy young purity no villain-lures Are spread to blemish; when thy mind matures In freedom, and thy soul can make its choice, Untrammelled, unconstrained, where heart assures The heart it is beloved; shall not thy voice And look restore to Earth its long-lost Paradise? 17 That Mind is of no sex, when thou art freed, Thy thought-deeds shall proclaim: our Edgeworth's sense; Our Baillie's truthful skill; Felicia's meed Of grace with perfectest mellifluence Of music joined; or thy magnificence Of heart and reason, Necker's glorious child! Problems shall be no more: Woman's intense Inherent claim to mind-rank, when befoiled No more by Man, she will display with glow unsoiled. 18 And when her children see her move in joy, And yet in truest dignity; no more A slave, no more a drudge, no more a toy! When from her lips of love her spirit's store Of high ennobling wisdom she doth pour Into her offspring's ears—into their eyes, Ere speech be learnt, looks Nature's purest lore Of truth and virtue,—shall not Man arise From error, nurtured thus, and loftiest good devise?— 19 These day-dreams past of Woman's destiny, To Man's auxiliar in beatitude, The brain in sleep, instinct with phantasy, But credent of its day-dreams, still pursued The theme. A verdant pasture-plain, I viewed, Unbounded, in that mystic spirit-land Where mortals who have ventured to denude The soul of clay without His high command— The great Life-Giver—feel His stern corrective hand. 20 But now, the end of punishment seemed near, And spirits talked of blest participance In life set free from pain and woe, and fear,— While I beheld them in thronged groupes advance, On journey bent to hear the utterance Of their high manumission. Prankt the plain Appeared with flowers of wild luxuriance Of growth and deep intensity of stain; But unto them no gloss nor perfume did pertain. 21 Their dyes seemed of such depth as dyes of flowers At summer's even, when the garish sun Hath set, and either human eyes new powers Receive, bedazed no longer,—the air hath won Strength to assist the optic nerve, or on The flowers themselves sheds chemic particles That deepen colours: thus they glowed, not shone: A rich array of blossoms, buds, and bells, So fragrant to the eye, Fancy supplied their smells. 22 And ever and anon some feminine form,— For souls of men appeared not in my dream,— Stooped to select some favourite from the swarm Of floral beauties, and then wound the stem Within her hair: others an anadem Of varied blossoms wove, and, garlanded, Discoursing rapturously of their high theme, Smiling, across the pleasant pasture sped:— Blythe sight it was to see, in soul-land of the Dead. 23 Nor unfamiliar seemed their faces fair, Their names and deeds, unto the dream-rapt soul: Though many a suicide of Eld was there: Full many a virgin whom old bards extol For spotless chastity, and of whose dole They make sweet plaint: full many a loving wife Of high heroic virtue that with cool Resolve chose death by poison-cup or knife, Or in the wave,—disdaining a dishonoured life. 24 And groupes passed by who fled from widowhood Through love excessive for their bosoms' lords; And throngs appeared that nobly shed their blood In patriotic struggle, when the swords Of tyrants slew their sons and sires, or hordes Of foreign foes sought to pollute their homes; And forms were there whom History records For questionable deeds, or whom Truth dooms To infamy,—though Fraud writ praises on their tombs. 25 From out a Roman groupe, methought, there passed Into a daisied bye-path, matrons twain Whose sable locks with hyacinths were graced. To their dark eyes a fervour did pertain That found its reflex in that sapphire stain: Intensely truthful was their spirits' glow; And, as mine joined them, on the green champaign, I pondered deeply on their mortal throe, And cause for which they did that death-pang undergo. 26 The twain were—Cato's daughter, Brutus' spouse— Illustrious suicidal lineage!— Whose death, so horridly courageous, Old legends tell; and she who to assuage Fear in her husband—by the tyrant's rage Death-doomed—plunged to her heart the steel, and cried ‘It is not painful!’—smiling, while the pledge So dread she gave of love. These, side by side,— Porcia and Arria, The suicides of Porcia,—by swallowing hot coals, when other means of self-destruction were placed beyond her reach; and of Arria, the wife of Pœtus, who was condemned to death, are familiar to almost every reader: the first is the subject of eloquent eulogy by Cicero, and the last is termed “the sublime” by Voltaire.—o'er the plain, conversing hied. 27 “Say, sister spirit!”Cato's daughter spake,— “Seems it not, now, to thee, but yesterday We did great Rome, our glorious home, forsake, To rush on death? Now they are passed away, The ages of our pain, in mind's survey, Seem nought; and yet, how drear in passing! Earth Produceth self-same thought and feeling: they Who sorrow reckon ages from the birth Of woe; but say 'twas short, when tears are changed for mirth.”— 28 Arria replied: “Such are my thoughts of weal “And woe on earth, my sister, and of joy That doth the sorrows of our essence heal In this strange afterstate, and mind upbuoy With cheering faith that, henceforth, no alloy Shall mingle with our bliss. Yet oft, our thought Shall wander back, and memory shall employ Her power to call up many an image fraught With tenderness—earth-forms on which the soul will doat. 29 “Oh! never can the hours of youthful love Cease to be precious, nor from memory fade, Amid the highest rapture we may prove Of that beatitude which shall pervade Hades for ever!”— “Nor shall aught upbraid The heart,”—Porcia rejoined,—“for this its truth “To what it chastely loved; but, rather, aid, From sweet revisitings of joys of youth, The spirit shall derive for its eternal growth. 30 “Ay, to the purest thoughts of Life's young spring Oft shall the ever-growing soul return, Drawn by the good each visit thence shall bring To the advancing spirit—which shall yearn For loftier good the further it is borne From evil: thus our minds, boon sustenance Deriving from the Past, and what we learn Of noblest kindred's high inheritance Of virtue, shall enlarge into a blest expanse.”— 31 “And dost thou think it shall be thus, indeed?” Said Arria: “shall our essence still expand “In bliss the more on virtue it doth feed, On soft beneficence, and breathings bland To bless,—much more than to be blest? How grand, How glorious, then, is human nature!—frail And puny though they termed it who had scanned, Or thought they scanned, its strength. Oh, that Mind's veil Some Power had rent while in its house terrestrial!” 32 “Not wholly secret, sister, was the true Sublimity of Man,”—said Porcia;—“some There were in every age and clime, though few, Who taught that goodness, and not awe and gloom, Must nurture the soul's bud until its bloom Should be unfolded into noblest bliss: The distant East, fair Greece, and our own Rome, Possessed such sages,—though the Priest's device Thwarted them evermore—with force, or artifice. 33 “Even in Earth's infancy a sage arose In Orient far, who taught how purely blest The spirit grew that could forgive its foes; How happiness was won by scorn of rest And ease, and choice of toil—to the distrest, In body or in mind, to bring relief: And after-sages did these truths attest: Alas! too oft by violent death their brief Love-toil was stayed: for Falsehood still held Man's belief! 34 “But who is this the wider way that leaves To cross our path, as if she sought to speak Of some glad birth her joyous soul conceives?— Hail, Carthaginian sister!”—to the meek, But fervid form,—Porcia spake on,—“thy cheek “Intensely glows, the gentle fire o' th' heart Revealing: say, what blissfulness dost seek To tell, that thrills thee, now our penal smart Is past? Haste, blythesome one, thy joy-thought to impart!” 35 “By sympathy, I knew that your discourse Was of the power of Goodness, and I yearned To hear ye its blest eulogy rehearse,”— Answer the wife of Asdrubal returned:— For she it was:—the same who nobly scorned To join her craven lord in traitorous flight To Scipio, and with her two children burned Within the sacred pyre herself did light, 'Mid the beleaguered city, in the Roman's sight. The story of the wife of Asdrubal, who cursed the treason of her husband, and then threw herself, with her children, into the flames of the temple of Æsculapius, which she had set on fire, is well known to all readers of Roman history.— 36 “Oh! well mayst thou the theme of gentleness Desire to list, ”—said Arria,—“for thy clime “Bruised by our sires' ambition 'neath excess Of humbled suffering sank; and though sublime Was thy death-deed, it was fell War's great crime That drove thee to that act.”— “But, now 'tis past,” Rejoined the Carthaginian,—“to o'erbrim “Joy's cup it seems that, though your sires laid waste My own loved fatherland, my heart hath ye embraced.”— 37 “And, sister, in our hearts we thee embrace,” Said Porcia,—“and partake thy bosom's thrill: “So blest is goodness that it can efface All baneful hatreds,—yea doth sweetly fill The soul with rapture, that no more the will Is anger's slave,—and spite can tribulate The mind no more—that self-tormenting ill! For we of misery, in our earthly state, Knew no more vulturous torture than relentless hate.”— 38 “Sad and blythe truths thy soul hath mingled,” said The virtuous African; “and 'tis most strange “In man's strange chronicle, that, though he bled, He coaxed this vulture of the heart:—‘Revenge Is sweet’—he madly cried! O blissful change, That, now, he feels 'tis sweeter to forgive! Still happier—that no ill shall disarrange The harmony in which all life shall live Henceforth—but bliss of higher bliss be nutritive. 39 “How oft the soul revolted, while on earth, Against the ill that did her powers enslave! How oft she fled-from gloom to think on mirth, Feeling it was her birthright, though some knave, In sanctimonious guise, upon the grave Would teach her still to ponder, and abjure All joy! How oft, in spite of wrongs, she clave Unto the nobleness of love—the pure Delight of showing that though wronged we can endure 40 “The wrong, and still forgive, and still endure! How oft, in spite of all misteachings, Mind, Irked by revenge, turned to the cynosure Of Gentleness, and for its pleasure pined! 'Twas Nature's truthful impulse!—so thy blind But cheerful face she teacheth fealty Unto the sun, on earth!”— She stooped, and twined A glowing marigold, full tastefully, Within her hair; then onward went, with modest glee.— 41 And still the descant was pursued, till two More sister-spirits crossed the pasture-plain, And sought with these the descant to pursue: The chaste Sophronia, who dishonour's stain To escape, fled, by her husband's will, self-slain, The lust-blight of Maxentius; “The virtuous matron, who stabbed herself to escape the violence of Maxentius, was a Christian, wife to the preæfect of the city, and her name was Sophronia. It still remains a question among the Casuists, whether on such occasions suicide is justifiable.”—Gibbon:note to chap. xiv. and with her That famous Jewess whom old Rabbins vain For wisdom praise,—Baruna, wife of Meir,— Of deep Talmudic lore the fair interpreter. Basnage, “Histoire des Juifs,” or the Appendix to Jahn's “Hebrew Commonwealth,” (collected from the voluminous work of Basnage), may be referred to for a brief narrafive of this suicide. 42 “Our Teacher taught us to forgive,”—the chaste Sophronia said;—“but, sister fair, the Law “Of old thy fathers reverenced nurtured haste For vengeance: our new joys for thee must flow With tenfold sweetness,”— “Christian, though I know “Thou speakest sooth,” Baruna said,— “too well “I also know, that few forgave a foe Who owned thy Teacher, and were loud to tell How far he did in wisdom all the Wise excel. 43 “I own that much was noble in thy faith; But, like all other faiths,—alas! 'twas made Subservient unto tyrant Power and Wrath, And grew, with lapse of time, a cunning trade Whereby the priest could pompously parade In gold and grandeur, while his lessons told Of meekest lowliness; and he could wade In human blood, ungainsayed, uncontrolled, Preaching of mercy and of goodness manifold! 44 “What horrors have my race endured throughout All lands called Christian, from the men called meek And merciful! Who did the Jew belowt And scorn and spit upon, and on the cheek Smite fierceliest, was deemed, by all, to seek Salvation zealously, and was upheld Worthiest of imitation. So to the sneak Into dim dens my race were driven: filth-celled They lived: vile things from human fellowship expelled. 45 “Nor in their squalidness was refuge found From Christian mercy: ‘Witchcraft!—Gold!’ outcried The plundering knave whose spotless robe around Him did proclaim his office was to chide And not to cheer Man's thirst for homicide: Then was the shrunk Jew rackt, and to the flame Condemned, or, like thy Teacher, crucified, If he refused the secret hoard to name He never had possessed! Such was their Christian game! 46 “I need not tell of Spain's black ‘Brotherhood’ Of murder, yclept ‘Holy,’—nor recal To mind the wolvish bands whose thirst for blood Jew-slaughter could not slake,—who fed on all That bore the name of Man, if one their thrall Resisted, or but murmured at their sway:— 'Tis past! No more their horrors shall appal The feeble, nor afflict the strong: away Their shapes are faded: who would wake them from decay? 47 “Be ours the theme more welcome, sisters mine, To picture the blest future and prepare Our spirits for the rest—the rest divine The persecuted, hence, shall ever share Even with their persecutors: for the slayer Shall with his victims join—to slay no more! The lion with the lamb shall make his lair! Rude, they were termed—yet, my sires' faith, of yore, The curtain of man's future bliss asunder tore: 48 “Amid their sterile mountains, Judah's bards Saw holier visions of Earth's coming glory Than all the minstrels who the world's awards Of honour won, chaunting of warriors gory And lauding as sublime Fame's transitory Triumphs. List, sisters, to that choral strain! How like the raptures of prophetic story It swells!” Heart's-ease she plucked, and did retain; But, to the Christian gave a lily without stain. 49 And then the happy sister sprites joined hands, And sped, a silent yet ecstatic throng, Their flower-bespangled way; while distant bands Of cheery travellers did this strain prolong Till gladsome thousands swelled the choral song:— ‘Farewell for ever to the reign of gloom, ‘Of human suffering, agony, and wrong! ‘Welcome, for Earth, her new and happy doom! ‘Welcome, for franchised spirits, Hades' blissful home! 50 ‘Farewell for ever to the darksome reign ‘Of Fear and Hate, Revenge and Tyranny! ‘How blest, that Hades shall be free from pain! ‘How blest that children upon earth shall be ‘No more taught malice on their mother's knee; ‘But love for foes—till foes are no more found! ‘Farewell to Earth's old evil revelry ‘Of war and bloodshed! Every brother's wound ‘Shall now be healed; and peace, and love and joy abound!’ 51 Beneath the mound, into the sculptured aisle, Trooping, with glee, I saw the thousands wend, Still pealing hymns of joy that their exile Was changed from woe to bliss, and that the end Of all Life's evils blest signs did portend On earth, and thorough Hades' ghostly clime!— But I surceased the theme to apprehend: The prison-bell, with its harsh grating chime, Rewoke me in the dreary den of crime-made crime. BOOK THE TENTH. 1 Hail, holiest Liberty! who hast thy shrine Deep in the faithful patriot's soul recessed,— Diffusing from thy visage light divine That glads the dungeon's gloom and drear unrest, Until it beams with visions overblest Of Right triumphant over hoary Wrong, And Truth victorious over Fraud confest, And new-born nations joining choral song O'er earth—become one temple for thy brother-throng! 2 Hail, sun-bright Liberty! Life-source of Truth, Without whom Knowledge waxeth sere, and falls Into her dotage; while with lusty youth Thou sinewest Reason till she disenthrals Her essence of Time's dreams, nor basely crawls At eld Authority's decrepid feet; But calmly to the toil of search upcalls Her vigour, and full soon each plausive cheat Detects, and winnoweth Folly's chaff from Wisdom's wheat. 3 Thou great palladium of the moral man, If thee by sloth self-treasonous Man doth lose,— Or foiled by force, or duped by charlatan,— How soon the serfish spirit doth diffuse Its influence through blood, and bones, and thews, Until his very form, his brow, his look, Forfeit their grandeur, and each gesture shows, Ere the low whine follows his lord's rebuke, What depth of insult, now, his slavish soul can brook! 4 But, garbed in humblest gear, if his birthright Be yet unbartered, unpurloined, unstained; If still his forehead bear thy sigil bright; How noble is Man's mien, how unconstrained He stands a witness for the truth, unfeigned, Or champion for the right, o'erawing kings And lordly powers, who feel as if arraigned Before their culprit; and with homagings Are fain to bow, and own themselves but meaner things. 5 With dignity so godlike, stood the sage Of Abdera, at Nicocreon's throne, Foiling the Cyprian tyrant in his rage: Anaxarchus. the follower of Democritus, who, when the tyrant of Cyprus threatened to cut out his tongue, bit it off, and spat it at the despot.—See Diogenes Laertius, or Stanley's or Enfield's Hist. of Philosophy. Galgacus and Wallace are, of course, alluded to in the following lines of the stanza. So stood the Caledonian captive one, Grand in his chains,—and from the Roman throne, Constrained regard: so gazed, with brow unblent, On vengeful Edward, Scotia's later son: So, while base Gesler shook, magnificent, Stood Tell the peerless peasant, in his hardiment. 6 Or what if Death, with grisliest terrors, scowl On thy brave offspring?—They can gaze and smile! So, in our age of grandest men, with soul Unpierced, that spirit universatile, Untiring Raleigh, at the axe could smile, Passing his finger calmly o'er the edge, And cleping it a medicine sharp, the while, But most remedial sickness to assuage,— Conscious Death could not mar his fame's high heritage. 7 So smiled our bravest, truest, martyred sire, Fell Superstition's victim, who could cheer, With heart that veritably quelled the fire, His brother sufferer, and more frail compeer,— Breathing those death-words that will fill the ear, And thew the heart of England, through all time, Until her children a mind-rampart rear Shall foil the Jesuit's craft, and save our clime From witnessing, again, the Priest's bold deeds of crime. 8 So smiled thy own, thy darling champion, A true-born Briton names not without pride That thrills the soul—our noble Algernon, Who gloried at the scaffold that he died For thine—the Good Old Cause,—nor falsified The promise of his youth. When, from thy womb, My country! shall such men be multiplied? O Liberty! o'er England's germs resume Thy quickening power,—or wake our fathers from the tomb! 9 We are become a servile sordid crew: The grandeur of our lineage is forgot: We crawl as if nor peer nor franklin knew His fathers walked erect, and parleyed not With Patience ere their swords the tyrant smote, Or humbled him to meekness: we ne'er turn Unto the page where their great deeds are wrote, And read, and ponder, till our bosoms burn To think the yoke they spurned, so long our necks have worn! 10 Our men of promise are a recreant horde: Even he who bears that glorious patriot name For which the friend of Sydney a record, Gold-writ, hath won on England's roll of fame, Starts, like an actor who hath oped the drame, Back from his part, afeard to play it through! And he, the golden-tongued,—a thing of shame Made by his whims,—to self—respect untrue,— What will he next?—the spaniel of old Waterloo? 11 Oh! haste to hide thee in the charnel grave, Thou Harlequin-Demosthenes!—ere change Shall leave thee not a semblant speck to save Of that rich monument which thou, with strange Fatuity, hast toiled to disarrange As hotly as to carve! Give up thy strife To mar it more; and list the White's revenge, Friend of the Black! 'Twill cleave to thee through life— The ‘Bastile’-curse—from Man severed from child and wife! 12 Arch-Traitor to thy kind! Scourge of the Poor! A word from thee had dashed their poison-cup To atoms; but thou, wantonly, didst more Prefer to their lean lips to hold it up! Ay, wast to thine own vanity the dupe So fully, as to claim that thou shouldst bear The dread weight of the crime! Would thou mightst sup For ages of that chalice! ‘Bastile’-fare, Perchance, a medicine were thy reason to repair. 13 Beshrew thy heart! but it was bold, as well As villanous,—responsibility To court—so foully, darkly damnable! Head-robber of the savage band to be Should perpetrate on human misery A theft so daring as would make recoil The sternest heart of ancient Tyranny!— Of Nature's rights the hapless wretch to spoil— Who hath no bread, because his lords refuse him toil. 14 And dost thou, scouted changeling! madly dream This lawless law will save ‘their lordships land’? Or, that to gaol and eunuch men the stream Of discontent can stop; and Misery's band Convert to sneaking slaves lords may command At will? As surely as thy head grows gray In this thy monstrous sin,—if not by brand, By mightier means, the Poor will win their way To right,—and shout when worms hold riot in thy clay! 15 Oh! not by changeling, tyrant, tool, or knave, Thy march, blest Liberty! can now be stayed: The wand of Guttemberg—behold it wave! The spell is burst!—the dark enchantments fade Of wrinkled Ignorance! 'Twas she betrayed Thy first-born children; and so oft threw down The mounds of freedom. Lo! the Book its aid Hath brought! The feudal serf—though still a clown, Doth read; and, where his sires gave homage, pays—a frown! 16 The sinewy artizan, the weaver lean, The shrunken stockinger, the miner swarth, Read, think, and feel; and in their eyes the sheen Of burning thought betokens thy young birth Within their souls, blythe Liberty! That earth Would thus be kindled from the humble spark Ye caught from him of Mentz, and scattered forth, Faust,—Koster,—Caxton!—not ‘the clerk,’ Himself could prophesy in your own mid-age dark! 17 And yet, O Liberty! these humble toilers The true foundation for thy reign begun. Ay, and while throne-craft decks man's murderous spoilers While feverous Power mocks the weary sun With steed-throned effigies of Wellington, And columned piles to Nelson,—Labour's child Turns from their haughty forms, to muse upon The page by their blood-chronicle defiled; Then, bending o'er his toil, weighs well the record wild. 18 Ay, they are thinking, at the frame and loom; At bench, and forge, and in the bowelled mine; And when the scanty hour of rest is come, Again they read—to think, and to divine How it hath come to pass that Toil must pine While Sloth doth revel: how the game of blood Hath served their tyrants; how the scheme malign Of priests hath crushed them; and resolve doth bud To band, and to bring back the primal Brotherhood. 19 What though, a while, the braggart-tongued poltroon, False demagogue, or hirling base, impede The union they affect to aid? Right soon Deep thought to such ‘conspiracy’ shall lead As will result in a successful deed— Not forceful, but fraternal: for the Past Hath warned the Million that they must succeed By will—and not by war. Yet, to hold fast Men's rage when they are starving—'tis a struggle vast! 20 A struggle that were vain, unless the Book Had kindled light within the Toiler's soul, And taught him though 'tis difficult to brook Contempt with hunger,—yet he must control Revenge, or it will leave him more a thrall: The pike, the brand, the blaze—his lesson saith, Would leave Old England as they have left Gaul— Bondaged to sceptred Cunning. Thus their wrath The million quell—but look for right with firmest faith. 21 Oh! might I see that triumph ere I die— The poor, oppressed, contemned, and hungered throng Hold festival for Labour's victory O'er Mammon, Pride, and Sloth; for Right o'er Wrong; Oh! might I hear them swell the choral song— ‘The Toiler's Rights are won! our Fatherland ‘Is fully free!’—with joy to rest among The solemn dead, at Nature's high command, I'd haste, not ask to stay the speed of one life-sand! 22 Nor selfish is the wish,—however vain; From boyhood, Greece, and our old Commonweal I worshipped; but 'twas gnawing hunger's pain I saw your lank and fainting forms reveal— Poor trampled stockingers!—that made me feel 'Twas time to be in earnest, nor regard Man's freedom merely as a theme for zeal In hours of emulous converse, or for bard Weaving rapt fancies in pursuit of Fame's reward. 23 I threw me in the gap—defying scorn, Threats, hatred, poisonous tongues—to front your foes; And this hath come of it,—that I have worn The fetters for your sake. Yet, now the close Of this captivity is near, no throes Of anger, sorrow, or regret, are mine For aught that I have suffered; but your woes— Poor victims! who by grinding tricksters pine,— Breed thoughts that with my hopes their tortures intertwine. 24 I would review my course,—that so I may Shun, for the future, aught unwise, unjust, Untrue to Freedom, if my rugged way I sometimes trod—like other things of dust— In error. Inly can I look, and trust My heart's clear witness, that I never swerved To wilful wrong. Yet thy demands august, Great Truth! I here obey, with spirit nerved By deep reflection—healthful aid but ill preserved 25 To him who mixeth with the whirl and rage Of popular commotion. Here I hold Thy mirror to my soul, and deeply pledge My heart it shall by clamour be controlled No more to thread the mazes manifold Of crookt Expediency,—nor through ill haste To end the Toiler's woe, to leave the bold And simple path be led: union unchaste With Faction will I shun—taught by the erring Past. 26 Here, then, O holiest Liberty! my heart I lay upon thine altar,—undismayed, Unswerving, unsubdued: the afterpart Of life it aims to play with healthier aid Of wisdom,—but no guilty thoughts upbraid: It asks but to be kept from sordid stain As free as now: let consciousness pervade Each pulse through life that still by gold or gain Unbought it beats; and it shall shun no toil, no pain. 27 O welcome, even if its blood be shed For thee, blest Freedom!—only keep it pure! Welcome the living death more deeply dread Of calumny, by evil shapes obscure That haunt the patriot darkling, and secure From Truth's Ithuriel spear, their poisons vend: Welcome, that keenest heart-ache—forfeiture Of friendship true: welcome, all pangs that rend The heart—if pure unto the grave it may descend! 28 Night's shadows gather once more in the sky, Tombing another day of thraldom's term, And leaving few more days to fortify The heart so that it freedom meet with firm And peaceful throb. What mingled feelings germ Within me,—what quick hosts of battling thought! Will, then, the world assume some new-born charm? And shall I feel, in it with change deep-fraught, As if I had been dead, and were to life new-brought? 29 Ah! soon it will appear the same poor vale Of tears; and soon my journey through its gloom Or radiance will be o'er. Let me not fail To keep my soul's resolve; and then unwomb What will, ere I attain my final doom, Right blythely will I on!—yea, meet grim Death Himself in peace: for what viaticum Need we, if Death be unto Life the path, But truthfulness of heart?—is it not more than faith? 30 And, if the grave indeed hath nought beyond Its cold confine, of thought, or joy, or love; If there we bid farewell unto the fond Cleavings o' the heart, for ever, and shall prove No more what rapture 'tis when hearts commove With mutual tenderness— I will pursue That theme no more. This love of life enwove Within me, Death itself may yet subdue; But, while I live 'twill burn its being to renew! 31 I dreamt again,—but 'twas a gladsome dream; A dream of portents beatifical: A dream where the prophetic brain did teem With glorious visions of high festival In sculptured aisle, and dome, and rainbowed hall: A festival of Brotherhood and Mind By suicidal spirits held, from thrall Of Evil freed; and mystically designed To adumbrate future bliss for Earth and humankind. 32 As where the way to some hoar fane of Nile— Carnac, or Luxor, or far Ibsamboul— Lay through an imaged path for many a mile, Of sphinxes huge or lions, so that lull With abject awe and fitted for the rule Of priests the worshipper approached,—thus seemed The aisle fit path to fill with beautiful Expectancies the ghostly throng that streamed Along its wilderness of sculptures, as I dreamed. 33 And when the dome we raught, felicity Of hope ripened to rapturous overbliss With what the spiritual sense did hear and see Beneath that span colossal: Music's voice A sweetness gushed fit to emparadise The plastic forms of wisdom and of worth That there in mystic apotheosis Of statued life reposed: forms of old Earth They were—the best, the noblest children of her birth. 34 Range above range rose many-fashioned niche, A caverned space as wonderful and vast As that weird city which few travellers reach— Idumæan Petra, in the dangerous waste; For a description of Petra,—the city in the rock,—the capital of Idumea, or the kingdom of Edom,—see the travels of Stephens the American. The description of this mysterious relic of the Past, can never be forgotten when once read. And in such order were the worthies placed That they, though mute, the world's progressive story Of spirit-toil revealed, from first to last; And how the spark, first caught by sages hoary From Nature's fire, Mind nurtured to a flame of glory. 35 From ancient Orient to the late-born West Bard, thinker, devotee of enterprise, Philanthropist and patriot, soul of quest For Nature's secrets, child in whose rapt eyes She glows so lovely that his spirit plies Its powers to imitate her forms—the gems From Earth's clay gathered—in immortal guise Seemed there enshrined: toilers whose very names Shed splendour more ineffable than diadems. 36 A bright Pantheon of the Meek, the Good, The Free, the Tireless, and the truly Great, It was: a mansion of soul-sanctitude That held the visitant spirit in a state Of ecstasied entrancement—all-elate With love and wonder, and yet hushed with awe: And Mind seemed sounds symphonious to create That heightened bliss, pondering on what it saw,— So that our thoughts germed music, by some unknown law. 37 Anon, this minstrelsy so wondrous ceased; And, with a groupe of spirits who stood nigh, Gazing as if they would for ever feast On what they saw, yet never satisfy Their yearning souls, forthwith, methought, that I Became consociate,—hearing how they spoke Their glowing thoughts, by numbers that swept by Still undistract, and still with sateless look Scanning the sculptures as they were a priceless book. 38 Of widely scattered nations were these ghosts, And widely spoken names:—for nought was sealed, In this most vivid dream, of all the hosts That Phantasy surveyed. First, was revealed He who in Athens to himself beheld Three hundred statues raised,—Demetrius Phalereus,—whom the sieging king expelled, And unto vessels for the vilest use The statues turned,—deeming their loved shapes dangerous. The suicide of Demetrius Phalereus. driven from Athens by Demetrius ??????????? (or the City-sieger), is related by Diogenes Laertius and others. 39 Exalted forms of ever-glorious Greece Were magnets to his eyes: her Poet-choir Divine,—where Homer, with the love increase Of time had fostered for the peerless sire Of song in the world's heart, sat crowned,—the fire Of soul, wanting its natural mirror, gleaming Throughout his sightless face: sons of the lyre Around, beneath him, sculptured stood, each seeming With awe to mark the splendour from his bald brow beaming. 40 On these the Athenian gazed, and on the throng Of god-like labourers for all human weal. There lowly Socrates—the loftiest 'mong The band fraternal—less by fervid zeal Than by his lowliness seemed to excel The excelling throng. Neither on patriot shapes With less love did he gaze: names that to tell Make monarchs quake, in spite of Time's long lapse: For still some slave, who hears, from their hard yoke escapes. 41 Fast by Demetrius stood a ghostly form Of later times, and of less peaceful deed:— Berthier,—the favourite of that Bird of Storm, The ravening Gallic eagle,—whose fierce greed Ceasing to aid, praise for defection bred Remorse so torturous in his soul, he spurned The thought of life, and from its torment fled. Marshal Berthier's suicide occurred under the following circum stances:—One of the German sovereigns, at whose court he was,if I recollect aright, was blaming the defection of Ney and others from the cause of the Bourbons, at Napoleon's return from Elba, and took occasion to compliment Berthier on his firmness in resisting a temptation natural to one who had been the bosom friend of Buonaparte. Berthier took the compliment so self-reproachfully to heart, that he withdrew to his chamber, threw himself from a window, and was taken up dead. With throes remorseful he no longer burned, But, with the Athenian, o'er those shapes of virtue yearned. 42 For though full many a sage philanthropist, High orator, and bard of comely France Were statued there, with emblems due deviced Their excellence proclaiming, yet the glance Of the war-wearied Frenchman, whose romance For his gay, glory-stricken land was gone, On Hellene forms made sweeter tarriance.— Like preference shared the spirit of Wolf Tone, That by him I saw stand,—Hibernia's patriot son. 43 Yet, in his country's Grattan, in the face Of brave Fitzgerald, and the generous brow Of fated Emmett, did the Hibernian trace Features that stirred the warm fraternal flow Within his essence and dispread the glow Of rapture o'er his visage. Paramount In virtue, still, he deemed that glorious show Of Greeks, and did the patriot deeds recount Of Hellas,—vaunting her true Glory's primal fount. 44 One stately form there was who on late men Stood in absorbed gaze,—strange thoughts of home, And change, and Wrong that made the world a den Of lawless beasts, revolving, till a gloom Curtained his brow. Yet, joy 'gan, soon, relume, With radiance visible, his new-born soul.— The spirit of imperial Montezume It was: that victim of ambition foul, Whose regal heart disdained the Spaniard's base control. “The unhappy monarch now perceived how low he was sunk, and the haughty spirit, which seemed to have been so long extinct, returning, he scorned to survive this last humiliation, and to protract an ignominious life, not only as the prisoner and tool of his enemies, but as the object of contempt or detestation among his subjects. In a transport of rage he tore the bandages from his wounds, and refused, with such obstinacy, to take any nourishment, that he soon ended his wretched days, rejecting, with disdain, all the solicitations of the Spaniards to embrace the Christian faith.”—Robertson's Hist. of America,—Book V. 45 Most wistfully he scann'd the intrepid calm That in the eye of great Columbus dwelt, Till sighs broke forth; and though a healing balm Las Casas' love-look o'er his essence dealt, 'Twas but a pause unto the grief he felt For his lost race; and he had wailed aloud, But that his wild eye alighted where he knelt In soul, and owned the majesty that glowed In Washington's benignly grand similitude. 46 Last of the groupe the patriot Shades I saw Of Romilly and Whitbread,—whose rapt gaze America's great son seemed oft to draw Aside from Alfred—for like glorious rays That did even disembodied vision daze, Streamed from the sculptures of the civic chief And diademed philanthropist: their praise They told, and would have mourned the sojourn brief Of such blest forms on earth; but rapture banished grief!— 47 “The glorious toil is o'er, my brother!”—spake The soul of Romilly,—while with the intense Joy of beneficence he seemed to quake;— “The glorious toil is o'er!—blest prevalence Mercy hath won: the evil effluence Of blood by brethren shed glad Earth shall see No more! Against the grim armipotence Of Anger, Hate, Revenge, and Cruelty, The toil was hard; but from their blight all Life is free! 48 “Who would have said, but they who felt her power, Before the still small voice of Gentleness The great ones of the Earth should one day cower, And kings her true divinity confess; The battle-field be green and thunderless; The scaffold and the gibbet disappear; The dungeon vanish: and, no more, distress, Hunger, and discontent raise troublous fear Of violence fell, and knit the ruler's brow austere?”—— 49 “Yet, this is her triumphant marvel-work!”— Said Whitbread's spirit:—““'twas her genial breath “Nourished most healthfully the deathless spark Of Freedom, when the streams of blood which wrath Had shed half-quenched it, and men's hope and faith In Liberty was changed to dread, and they With tears of hushed despair sighed that the path Of Thraldom must be trod—thinking the sway Of Sceptres better than the howl of wolves of prey.”— 50 “Brother, thy thoughts are of my fatherland,”— Said Berthier;—“and if this our new-born joy “Did not the phantasms of Earth's wrong disband, Great grief were mine. But this doth still destroy The spectrous visitings which would annoy My spirit—that although the strife for Right Was urged by advocates who did employ Wrong's weapons in their overzeal,—the might Of Truth, at length, hath made her victress in the fight. 51 “'Twas long and toilful; and, in every clime, Too oft in error did her champions ease Seek by the sword. The register of Time Is a dark volume; and what soul that sees His autograph in characters that please His conscience throughly, on the record writ? That all is well at last, may well appease The self-accusing shapes which still would flit Through memory, and loathe their long-known haunts to quit. 52 “Our penal throes are ended here: Earth's sorrow, From war and violence, hatred and revenge, Is past. For ever, therefore, let us borrow Help from such thoughts our spirits to estrange Still more and more from woe!”— “This joyous change May well absorb our thought,”—the Shade began Of noble Montezuma,—“yet to range “Her youthful haunts the soul can scarce refrain: Bliss hath not changed us into things marmorean. 53 “Love for dear Mexico and my crushed race, Trampled by haughty Cortez and his crew, Eternity itself cannot efface Within my essence; nor regret subdue That Fate should thus relentlessly pursue One hapless people, and their glory sweep Into oblivion. While I with ye view These glorious forms, how can I fail to weep That my sires' deeds of worth are lost in darkness deep? 54 “What am I but the shadow of a name? My people's virtues, glory, arts, unknown: Hurled by their conquerors to barbarian shame. Though they deserved it not—but might have shone Among the nations, had not Spain's dark frown Of pride and cruelty spread woe and waste Where'er it fell, blighting the happy zone Our fathers' sons long held, their daughters graced: Oh no! I cannot tear from memory all the Past! 55 “Natheless, my brothers, I with ye rejoice That after Earth's long ages of dispute, Conquest and blood, the gentle, healing voice Of Goodness doth prevail. Murders pollute My ancient clime no more; and, though the foot Of strangers treads upon our fathers' dust, Since they have learned to live like brothers, mute The Mexican shall be of wrongs that thrust His people from the soil: deeds bloody and unjust. 56 “No image of my fathers I behold Among these forms of worth, on which to doat With fond affection; but the heart is cold Whose joys are all with selfish yearning fraught: My heart doth swell with love towards all who wrought Out liberty and peace and brotherhood For poor Humanity, by toilful thought, Through suffering and through scorn. As with a flood Of grateful love it swells for all the Great and Good!”— 57 “Nobly thou hast discharged thy generous soul,”— The Hibernian spirit said:—“Mind cannot lose “All impress of the Past,—cannot control Her frequent wish to roam where early vows Were made to Truth and Freedom—shapes that rouse The antagonistic phantasies of Fraud And Tyranny. Nor should the soul accuse Herself for ire at wrong: 'twere vile to laud That which is evil: it demands our censure broad. 58 “Less were an error; but to pass beyond An upright indignation were to bring Back on our souls self-torment, and surround Our essences again with suffering. The memory of wrong, now that the sting Of base revenge is drawn, shall minister To higher bliss—to sweeter revelling In joy; for it shall be the harbinger Unto the heart's sweet sense—Forgiveness triumphs there! 59 “If on the fateful Past thou lookst to grieve, How much more might I utter mournful plaint For Erin's woe? Spirit! it should relieve Thy soul that sword and torture did attaint The lives of thy sires' race. Better than faint, And pine, and howl, and curse their tyrant lords For ages, and still feel a strange constraint To live and multiply mean serfish hordes! Such woes my memory of her fatherland records. 60 “Thy race by death were happily set free From their tormentors: mine remained to gnash Their teeth, in rags and hunger,—yet to see Their conquerors revel; to behold each flash Of freedom fail, and by its failure dash Their hopes to deep despair; to glow and burn Again with patriot ire,—and yet by rash Outbreak to plunge in hopeless horror. Turn And look on thy lost race, spirit, to triumph; not to mourn!” 61 “My brother spirits!”—said the Athenian ghost,— “This theme to me were fruitful of regret, If, 'mid these glories, I could be engrossed With tristful thoughts. Did not the tyrant fret The limbs of Hellas with the chain? Forget Ye that the mother-land of Freedom wore The gyves of Slavery vile, for ages? Let That mournful thought lead ye to mourn no more For aught your brethren suffered in the days of yore. 62 “Save her few mountain-fastnesses, old earth Has not a spot where men the tyrant-yoke Of brother-men have never borne. Let mirth— High, holy, blissful mirth in us be woke That world-wide bondage is for ever broke, And free souls fill the universe. Not sadness Should rise while back upon the Past we look; But grateful joy that Man's career of madness Hath wise fruition—age-long woe doth end in gladness. 63 “Still let us drink with ecstasy and wonder, As at a living fountain, lessons sweet While on the lofty lineaments we ponder Of all Earth's Great and Good; and still repeat This precious thought—that we our brethren greet In these bright shapes. What their meek souls attained Of lofty purpose, patient power to treat Their foes with gentleness; what height they gained Of mental grandeur; how by charm of meekness reigned 64 “O'er fiercest natures, and their rage subdued; How persevering love won even the foes Who thirsted for their blood to doff their rude And murderous frowns, and smilingly disclose The heart's regenerate kindness; how the throes Of pain they conquered, and, triumphing, hurled Thraldom, revenge, hate, envy, all Man's woes, For ever, from the groaning, bleeding world; And over sea and strand the gonfalon unfurled 65 “Of Truth and Love, Knowledge and Gentleness: All their eternal triumphs we may share In this exultant thought—the fair impress Of our humanity they meekly wear, And of their glory we are, each, the heir— For our own brethren's heritage to us Belongs. Brothers, be blythe, be debonair! And let our happiest thoughts the reins give loose While on these brother-forms we gaze, so luminous!”— 66 Such hortatives sad broddings to dispel, And revel to the full in their new joys, The Athenian uttered; and a blythe farewell, Methought, they, forthwith, bade to all alloys Of happiness; and yet no overpoise Their spirits felt: their joy was fraught with high And eloquent descant that became the Wise, The Noble, and the Good: nor did they vie In speech; but held discourse shorn of earth's vanity.— 67 Anon, woke thrilling sounds omnipotent, On earth, to null all thoughts but such as sprung Up armëd in the brain while forth was sent The trumpet's peal,—but such as sought a tongue, Yet found it not, while horn and harp notes clung Unto each other's sweetness,—or the heart Melted to faintness, with rapt wailings wrung Of hautboy and bassoon. Such prelude, thwart The dome resounding, seemed known signal to depart. 68 Soon, blent these brothers were with throngs that now Flocked onward where, beyond the vault's vast span, I saw revealed a dazzling heaven-dight bow, Grand beyond likeness, and by wondrous plan Unto the hall with roof cerulean Serving for gate-way arch. Thither to speed, With uplift gaze, the spirit-crowd began,— While to the prelude movements did succeed Of all superbest sounds the mind devours with greed. 69 Now, full-pulsed tympanum and deep-toned string Proclaimed dense myriads marching with the step Of stately joy to some vast gathering; While, ever and anon, the trill and sweep Of flutes and viols caused the heart to leap With foretaste of its banquet. Mind hath known. Ne'er in its house of clay, rapture so deep From Handel's giant pomps on organ blown, While 'long cathedral aisles some pageant proud was strown. 70 Beneath the wondrous arch of heavenly sheen, I passed into the hall, when—lo! no more Monarchal thrones and monster shapes were seen Within; but, from the middle of its floor Immense, shelved gently upward countless store Of sculptured seats extending to the bound Of that ellipsis vast; and wisest lore By plastic art into each seat seemed wound— So that the mind read deepest lessons all around. 71 And, on the rim of the ellipse, where, erst, Wild shapes reared irkingly, as if To prop the rainbowed roof, in dread 'twould burst Upon their heads, stood images of life, Bright as the sun, their countenances rife With blended beauty, intellect, and love: Fair plumëd wings they had; but 'twas a strife For mind to judge what it did best behove To say they were—such grace seemed in their forms enwove. 72 And, as the myriad multitude swarmed in, Filling the spacious amphitheatre, In spirit-whispers some of seraphin And some of genii talked, and guessed these were Such mystic essences. Interpreter None needed long; the soul 'gan soon perceive They were her own creations, which the stir Of glorious brother-thoughts had power to enweave To sensuous shapes—as if they did to sight upheave. 73 With visages as bright, with looks as blest As kindly and intelligent, all beamed And smiled upon each other, while their rest They took upon the graven seats. None deemed Himself nobler than others: none esteemed His brother meanly: pride, and rank, and state Had vanished; and, all equal, as beseemed A brother-throng, together Essence sate, In love, of humblest citizen and potentate. 74 Aloft, o'er all, the roof with splendour hued Of bows celestial still was self-suspended, The regal forms whose blazoned pomp I viewed In earlier dreams, now sat with sages blended— Uncrowned, unsceptered, all their haught looks ended— With bards, and workers-out of human weal, And patriots who in lofty deed transcended Their earthly fellows. Ghosts of erring zeal For faiths fantastic, creeds incomprehensible, 75 And cruel idol-worships, whom I saw Climbing the Mount of Vanity; the wild Lone dweller in the cave, whose rage with awe I witnessed 'mong his snakes; the Poet-child With his lamenting harp, who wept, exiled To forest-solitude; the tuneful choir Of bards who walked the grove; the band who toiled, For aye, to kindle the fierce fatal fire Of soul wherewith France lit the devastating pyre 76 Of Liberty; a moiety of the ghosts Who idly lay along the beach i' the land Of Sloth and Desolation; Sorrow's hosts; And crowds of those fair forms who, hand-in-hand, Sped o'er the pasture plain, with greetings bland, And garlanded with flowers; all sat arrayed In simple yet attractive guise: a band Of souls whose glorious joy-light had no shade: Wrath, pride, guilt, woe, for ever from each essence fled! 77 Soft consentaneous murmurs soon were heard 'Mid which distinguishable grew the name Of sage Lycurgus,—whereat claricord And viol, clarion, pipe and drum became Mute as expectant listeners; and the claim Fraternal to receive his speech, with meek Yet manly front he rose to answer. Maim No longer were the powers of voice: the Greek Did seem, and they that followed, with Earth's tongues to speak. 78 “Brother and sister spirits, to rehearse Our joy,”—he said,—“what volumed tongue hath skill? “Our happiness, like the Eternal Source From which it springs, doth ever over-fill And over-run; so that our bliss we still Augment, commingling bliss. I triumph not To think me a true seer: too deep the thrill Of ecstasy doth move me that all doubt And guess are past, and this beatitude is raught. 79 “Brothers, this blest reality hath swept The films of mystery from the general mind; And he who doubted most now an adept Becomes in tracing Nature's progress: blind Were many, once: but how it was designed From earliest eld, that pain corporeal,— That hate, and torture with it intertwined, Should pass away, and brotherhood prevail And joy,—all now perceive with vision spiritual. 80 “Ye who, with opulence of speech endowed, Excel, begin the never-tiring theme— What mighty influences did long enshroud Themselves from vulgar gaze, and yet did seem To Nature's true disciples with the beam Of splendour's self revealed,—and sure to drown And overwhelm all error, as a stream Resistless sweeps all human barriers down— Or as Light's genial smile o'ercometh Night's drear frown. 81 “How we now wonder, while our ken afar Travels from these joy-seats,—surveys the dome Resplendent with full many an exemplar Of human virtues,—and enrapt doth roam Along the dazzling aisle where graces bloom Ineffable,—how we now wonder Truth So long was hid! Be thine the exordium O Mithridates! to portray the growth Of Good, and how she vanquished all her foes uncouth!”— 82 So spake the great Laconian, and his seat Meekly resumed, while gentle murmurings rose From myriads who would fain the sage entreat His descant to prolong: but no applause He sought, and signified he lacked dispose, By silent smiles. Disrobed of pomp and pride, With truer glory clad than regal shows, The spirit of the Pontic king complied With the wise Spartan's call—by thousands ratified.— 83 “Lycurgus, though thy modesty would wave Our soul's full tribute,”—he arose and said,— “Yet here I laud thy wisdom deep, and suave Forbearance 'mid the scorn that on thy head We in our rashness—by old pomps misfed And overblown—poured, when we should have praised. Wisely thou sayst the lessons here outspread, Through hall and dome and aisle, have in us raised Wonder that we so long in ignorance on them gazed. 84 “How glorious is the vision now 'tis filled With meaning to our spirits!—all unlike The vanities our pomp-slaved thought did build To lull our sense of pain, and that made quick Evanishment when reason shook her sick Lethargic bondage off. The beauteous aisle Designed by graces architectonic To pourtray outward Nature's varied pile— Now knows each spirit-denizen of self-exile:— 85 “Nor this alone, but man's own outward form And potency. And even as on earth Love for the outer world did widely germ In man, and love for self,—while of no worth Seemed intellectual wealth, but Mind a dearth Of noblest images did long unfold— So yon vast dome, designed to shadow forth Man's inner nature, till of late no mould Of virtue held, though it doth now rich treasure hold. 86 “For ages did the lesson us invite To contemplation: but the soul was held In earth's old bonds of prejudice, nor right From wrong discerned. In thraldom thus we dwelled Of self-deceit: vile thraldom, though we swelled With arrogant conceit how free we were! Darkness and vagueness from the soul expelled,— Her chambers filled with Virtue's symbols fair,— Reason disdaineth pride and all its fraudful glare. 87 “And now our nature's stately portraiture We view. The aisle is fitting vestibule Unto the dome stored with memorials pure— Like cultured intellect with beautiful Exterior;—and then Reason's lofty rule, Where prejudice was paramount, appears; From proud and tyrant phantasies the soul Is freed; and since free-thought her essence cheers, Free-thought in every human spirit she reveres. 88 “Sage Spartan, thus I read our visioned state. Rehearsal, how our sufferings passed away, And how old Earth became regenerate, I yield unto my brethren, though I may, For opening of the theme, thus much essay: 'Twas conquest over Evil physical That ushered in Earth's glorious brother-day:— Whence came, by law of sympathy whose veil Is still unrent, our blest soul-state perpetual. 89 “I judge that Earth had still in bondage been To Error, had the sons of enterprise And science, unobservant, failed to glean The truths Great Nature spread before the eyes Of heedless Man, whose passion for life's toys Robbed him of its true treasures, and so doomed Him all his days with pain to agonize, With want and woe: a creature spirit-gloomed Though tenanting a world where jocund beauty bloomed: 90 “A world whose elements were his wide field For culture. Now,—behold the storm-tossed sea His pathway!—see, his chariots o'er it wheeled More swiftly than o'er land, by energy Electric—which men deemed a mystery, Or sign of wrath divine, till from the cloud A sage, with children's kite and string, and key, Drew the winged essence, and the truth foreshowed, Unwittingly, how, one day, men would tame the proud 91 “All-scathing power, and dangle its huge strength With child-like effort! Mountain, stream, and mine Their wealth afford him: Earth, through all the length And breadth and depth of her rotund confine,— Th' impalpable and vital crystalline Itself—are, each, his servitor! Of want Men talk as of some ancient fable: pine They cannot, for the soil, exuberant Rendered by art, of food is over-ministrant. 92 “The senses know no craving: neither strife Nor guile to win indulgence, or obtain What all enjoy, embitters human life: Disease is banished—until mortal pain Approaches: Even the bounds of life's domain Are trebly larger. Brothers, do I deem Aright that mortal men and spirits gain Their high beatitude, because supreme Men grew o'er natural Evil? But, I yield the theme.”— 93 He ceased, abruptly, feeling modest fear His speech assumptive occupance of thought Might seem where all were equal: to revere The humblest, thus, the highest Power was brought, His soul with loving due allegiance fraught To Nature and Equality. The ghost Of Cato rose,—with look which did denote That sternest spirit of all haughty boast Was stript;—and thus he argued 'mid the spiritual host:— 94 “O Mithridates, none will raise dispute Against thy judgment: yet I deem the end Thou hast not raught,—but left for our pursuit Thy argument begun. That earth doth lend Her general wealth to men, and the now bend Our old dread masters—fire, and wind, and flood— Unto their will,—and that these conquests tend To bring our happy state,—were hardihood For any to deny what long for truth hath stood. 95 “While with the elements, for foes, Man warred, Want, pain, disease, were his sure heritage Afflictive: hostile life bred in him hard, Vindictive thoughts: and thus, from age to age, Men lived—the fool in mind diseased: the sage In body: helpless, both. Thou sayst full well, Great Nature's truths were open; and the page Had mortals scanned, each pregnant syllable Divining, Evil they had earlier learned to quell. 96 “The fault lay not in Nature, but in Man— The slothful pupil in her school, or wild And perverse truant after vice. Her plan Was stern but wise: to train her favourite child To cope with obstacles, lest he, beguiled By over-ease, should an ignoble thrall Become to pleasure. The great Mother smiled Even while she seemed to frown: her child in all Her discipline found toil did some worse ill forestall: 97 “Nay more:—that labour brought its unalloyed And precious sweet, while sloth 'mid plenty took All appetite away, or luxury cloyed The sense until the Man beneath its yoke Bowed down, and bestial grew in thought and look. One obstacle o'ercome, the mind was fired To nobler strife. Thus Nature ne'er forsook Her offspring: all her matron cares conspired To raise him: he, perverse, the bestial state desired. 98 “'Tis, then, unto the Few, the tireless Few Who through all ages and in every clime, Pursued the Good, our gratitude is due. Thus moral, mental conquest was the prime Of human victories: triumph so sublime O'er outward elements sprang from the wreath Of moral victory; and throughout all time They glorious shall be held who did bequeath Lessons of moral struggle in their lives or death.” 99 So spake the high-souled Roman Stoic, whom Followed his Grecian exemplars with zeal, Zeno, and meek Cleanthes; and their doom That, first, Man's conquest o'er himself the weal Prepared of future men, and did reveal To him his latent power to nullify Earth's outward ills,—strengthened, with kindred zeal, Clitomachus,—for here had ceased to vie The sect of Plato with the Porch, for mastery. 100 Like judgment rose and uttered, Metrocles, Who honoured age and royal favour fled To shun men's jealousy. But now to seize The argument, though not by passion led Or unfraternal thought, Lucretius sped; And while he left ungainsayed what in praise Of human conquests these, through zeal, had said, In calm reflective strain and gentle phrase He shewed the victors oft had won no truthful bays.— 101 “Spirits, ye well have shewed that to the ken Of universal man wide open lay The book of Nature,”—said the bard: “the men Ye also wisely laud who o'er their clay Superior rose, and, for their kind, the way Opened to nobler life and high command O'er outward ill: but know ye not that they Were fitted for their work by Nature's hand, From embryons in the primal purposes she planned? 102 “That Nature's volume lay unspelled so long— Attribute to her wisdom which doth shun Rash haste: she forms her favourite lithe, but strong To bear and to endure, as well as run Their race and slack not till the goal is won. Neither forget how many sought to find Out Nature's ways, but failed. Sought they the boon, Then, vainly, through sheer impotence of mind, Or was successful quest for later men designed? 103 “Brothers, have noblest intellects, late-born, In grasp excelled the mighty Stagyrite? Did any cast o'er Nature's face extern Larger discourse, or with more piercing sight Scan her deep secrets, or pour fuller light Intense of Reason on her footsteps broad That men might not her bounteous purpose slight? Who,—while late Western sages they applaud, The earlier toiler of his guerdon will defraud? 104 “Yet, often, where he thought he knew—'twas guess. And what he would have known, even at the cost Of life itself, his eagle-sightedness Of soul failed to perceive. Then, twas the boast Of some mere modern dwarf to shew where lost His search—the ancient giant; though the vaunt Belonged not him who said, he found: a host Of names have won from men extravagant Applause, while of their worth Truth was uncognisant. 105 “Not their more skilful thought plombed the great deep Of Nature's mystery, which so many failed To fathom: 'twas Herself away did sweep The incumbent waves of darkness, and unsealed Truth's gems,—for then the channels were revealed Where they had lain for ages. Accident,— Contingency,—some called it,—when to yield Her fruit mature, Nature, prepared: content With any name to hide their gross-souled wonderment! 106 “Some said the wondrous optic tube had been For ever undiscovered,—vast expanse Of space with all her suns and systems, seen By its weird aid,—and all their utterance Of dateless Nature's old continuance And might and grandeur been for ever hid,— If the mechanic had not marked, by chance, His children's wonder, while, at play they slid Together and peeped through the crystals pellucid. 107 “Others the thread-bare story oft rehearsed— Whenas the godlike sage of Albion's isle Beheld the apple fall, at once dispersed Were Nature's mists, and, without further toil Of mind, he rose, and with complacent smile, Serious but glad, proclaimed the force sublime That binds Earth's surface to her centre while She wheels around the sun, pervades his clime, And keeps all planets in their bounds from birth of Time 108 “'Twas accident, they said,—that from the bough The apple fell, the sage in musing vein Beheld it, and, like other truths that flow By chance into men's minds, within the brain Of Newton this upsprung,—else, it had lain, Belike, still unperceived, still unproclaimed.— Thus some the noblest toils of thought were fain To reck for nought,—enthroning Chance; while maimed Inferior wits with awe by other tongues were named. 109 “Few were thy words, Lycurgus, but profound In truth: from earliest eld all was designed Or ordered that hath been: Nature's great round Must needs be travelled: Circumstance and Mind, Alike, must be brought forth, and be combined, Ere mightiest Truths evolved: Necessity O'er all prevailed: the flame, the flood, the wind, Were masters till the march of Thought set free The world of struggling men from that old tyranny: 110 “The march of Thought was onward from of old,— Onward, for age, to Nature's eye,—though dense Film-sighted men no progress could behold: Thought sprung from thought by chain of consequence, In old or newer clime, till violence, Fraud, ignorance, want, and woe, and pain, and thrall Evanished at the new omnipotence Of Mind Nature brought forth: Mind that thro' all The universe now reigns by might perpetual.” 111 Lucretius ceased; and sounds applausive rose From myriads, though in gentlest mode exprest.— And, next, high reasonings on effect and cause, And strong necessity, full suavely addrest The soul of Atticus unto the blest Assemblage of untroubled minds—who heard Discourse on mysteries deep without unrest In their new state, since mysteries now ensnared To doubt no more: doubt, fear, with pain had disappeared. 112 Thereafter rose the Gracchus, and with mild Yet firm aspect, what seemed forgot, thus urged:— “Brothers, with metaphysic thought beguiled, And descant on discovery that enlarged Man's rule o'er outward things,—not undischarged Leave we commemoration due of their Desert whose tireless energies converged To throne the thought of Brotherhood where'er They went:—but for their zeal our lot were still despair: 113 “But for their holy strife,—smit with the type, Great Spartan, thou in mortal life didst frame,— Earth had been yet for franchisement unripe; And thence unblest. Brothers, to mar no claim Of Wisdom's children to their during fame I seek: honour, all honour to each shade Of Enterprize,—to every hallowed name Of Genius,—and to all who first displayed To man the power o'er ill that for his seizure stayed!— 114 “But who can fail remember that this power Was long usurped by Selfishness?—that Wonder Herself was mazed through every passing hour At man's achievements,—as he bound the thunder, The storm-wave smoothed, the live rock clave asunder, Or rendered distance but a name; yet Love Wept to behold Earth's sable children under The chain, while their fair-visaged brother drove Them onward with the lash! Let Time the stain disprov 115 “The foul aspersive stain on Freedom cast By men whose boast of freedom was most loud! Bethink ye also that if men now fast And pine no more, it is because the Proud Have ceased to be: Earth ever was endowed With tenfold more of plenty than her sum Of life required for food: the hills were browed With luscious vines that smiled as round they clomb The olives, or festooned them with their purple bloom 116 “The valleys spread their waving treasures forth; But, when the vintage came and harvest-tide, Although the toiler gave his heart to mirth— To Nature's impulse true—the wealth for Pride Was garnered up, and Toil was pittanced. Wide O'er ocean islets fair were scattered, filled With overwealth of fruits, but desert-void Of human life: the dainty fig there spilled Her seeds; the golden orange her perfume distilled 117 “Upon the vacant air; the grateful palm And wholesome guava and banana stored In vain the sea-girt garden; sweetest balm Of gums or delicatest juice of mangoes poured Their riches on the tasteless earth; down showered Their flavoured kernels shelly fruits in vain, Unless for brutes. Men,—starving men,—looked toward The sea, and sighed for ships to pass the main And end their famine; but they could no help obtain! 118 Avarice still held them where their numbers served To render them dog-cheap as things of hire For labour: Avarice, that never swerved From sordid grasping, though it might acquire Unreckoned wealth. Vapour, electric fire, All mineral virtues, air, and flame, and flood, Science subdued; but Pride did still conspire With Avarice the lean toilers to exclude From all that Science willed to spread for general good. 119 “O Mithridates, thou didst this forget, Or leave untold. Doth not thy soul perceive It was when signs of Brotherhood were met With open heart by Pride, and Power to leave Its lawlessness the toiler to retrieve From suffering, yielded,—that the glorious dawn Of Bliss appeared, and moral light did cleave Earth's age-woofed darkness? But I joy 'tis gone— The reign of Wrong; and toiling men no more shall groan.”— 120 The Agrarian ceased, at once: such gentle dread The blest assemblage swayed to raise a thought Averse in brethren. With mild zeal to tread The same thought-track Curtius arose: Thence caught The theme Charondas, and, then, Codrus brought His aid: and, then, Themistocles: but suave Their accents were, with tempered reason fraught,— Although they told how patriot deeds raised brave Resolve in toiling men—till Slavery found its grave.— 121 Next, rose Athena's soul-compelling tongue, And joined his sentence for the patriot's praise; Yet told, therewith, that poets had not sung In vain,—nor sculptor vainly fixed the gaze Of nations,—architect with deep amaze Entranced them vainly,—nor had Music's joy Earth visited and failed the mind to raise And heart to bless; but Nature did employ Innumerous powers the thrall of Evil to destroy.— 122 And, next Demosthenes, Condorcet's soul Uttered its fervour:—'Twas when Man disdained,— He said,—to kneel beneath the priest's control, An altar-serf, that human freedom gained Its first true vantage-ground, and Evil waned In all its monstrous forms and torturous might; And only when free-thought all men maintained To be their indefeasible birthright,— It was,—that Error multiform was put to flight.— 123 Then Romilly renewed his eulogy Of Gentleness; and spirits thrilled to hear His laud of Mercy, till with jubilee Of love they rose,—monarch, and bard, and seer, Fanatic wild, and misanthrope austere, That were on earth,—now all in equal state Of happy brotherhood,—and, thus, with clear Euphonic chaunt, I heard them celebrate, In concord blest, Earth's, Hades' gladness consummate:— 124 ‘All hail the glorious power of Gentleness, ‘Of Pity and Mercy, Goodness, Love, and Truth! ‘Knowledge all hail, and Reason fetterless! ‘Philanthropy, that yearned with god-like ruth ‘O'er suffering! Patriotism, whose eloquent mouth, ‘Bold heart, and sinewed hand dissolved the thrall ‘Of Tyrants! Genius, Song, and Wisdom sooth, ‘All hail! Great sources of old Evil's fall— ‘Men, spirits, hymn your power, in jocund festival! 125 ‘Earth's children raise their universal song ‘Of love and joy: mountain, and strand, and sea ‘Are vocal with your praise! Spirits prolong ‘The strain: through endless life they anthem ye— ‘Their endless afterlife of jubilee: ‘And hymning ye our essences enhance ‘Still more the bliss-gauge of their destiny,— ‘Assured more deeply of their heritance, ‘The more their joyous thought hath joyous utterance! 126 ‘Spirits, still more rejoice!—for pain and woe ‘Are gone, and universal life doth bloom ‘With joy!’— The dream o'erwrought me to a throe Of bliss; and I awoke to find my home A dungeon,—thence, to ponder when would come The day that Goodness shall the earth renew, And Truth's young light disperse old Error's gloom,— When Love shall Hate, and Meekness Pride subdue,— And when the Many cease their slavery to the Few! SMALLER PRISON RHYMES. CHARTIST CHAUNT. Truth is growing—hearts are glowing With the flame of Liberty: Light is breaking—Thrones are quaking— Hark!—the trumpet of the Free! Long, in lowly whispers breathing, Freedom wandered drearily— Still, in faith, her laurel wreathing For the day when there should be Freemen shouting—‘Victory!’ Now, she seeketh him that speaketh Fearlessly of lawless might; And she speedeth him that leadeth Brethren on to win the Right. Soon, the slave shall cease to sorrow— Cease to toil in agony; Yea, the cry may swell to-morrow Over land and over sea— ‘Brethren, shout—ye all are free!’ Freedom bringeth joy that singeth All day long and never tires: No more sadness—all is gladness In the hearts that she inspires: For, she breathes a soft compassion Where the tyrant kindled rage; And she saith to every nation— ‘Brethren, cease wild war to wage: Earth is your blest heritage.’ Though kings render their defender Titles, gold, and splendours gay— Lo, thy glory—warrior gory— Like a dream shall fade away! Gentle Peace her balm of healing On the bleeding world shall pour; Brethren, love for brethren feeling, Shall proclaim, from shore to shore— ‘Shout—the sword shall slay no more!’ CHARTIST SONG. Air—The Brave Old Oak. A song for the Free—the brave and the free— Who feareth no tyrant's frown: Who scorneth to bow, in obeisance low, To mitre or to crown: Who owneth no lord with crosier or sword, And bendeth to Right alone; Where'er he may dwell, his worth men shall tell, When a thousand years are gone! For Tyler of old, a heart-chorus bold Let Labour's children sing! For the smith with the soul that disdain'd base control, Nor trembled before a king; For the heart that was brave, though pierced by a knave Ere victory for Right was won— They'll tell his fair fame, and cheer his blythe name, When a thousand years are gone! For the high foe of Wrong, great Hampden, a song— The fearless and the sage! Who, at king-craft's frown, the gauntlet threw down, And dared the tyrant's rage; Who away the scabbard threw, when the battle blade he drew, And with gallant heart led on! How he bravely fell, our children shall tell, When a thousand years are gone! For the mountain child of Scotia wild— For noble Wallace a strain! O'er the Border ground let the chaunt resound: It will not be heard in vain. For the Scot will awake, and the theme uptake Of deeds by the patriot done:— They'll hold his name dear, nor refuse it a tear, When a thousand years are gone! An anthem we'll swell for bold William Tell, The peasant of soul so grand! Who fearlessly broke haughty Gesler's yoke, And set free his fatherland: His deeds shall be sung, with blythesome tongue, By maiden, sire, and son, Where the eagles climb o'er the Alps sublime, When a thousand years are gone. For our Charter a song! It tarrieth long— But we will not despair; For, though Death's dark doom upon us all may come, Ere we the blessing share,— Our happy children they shall see the happy day When Freedom's boon is won; And our Charter shall be the boast of the Free, When a thousand years are gone! CHARTIST SONG. Air—Canadian Boat Song. The time shall come when Wrong shall end, When peasant to peer no more shall bend— When the lordly Few shall lose their sway, And the Many no more their frown obey. Toil, brothers, toil, till the work is done— Till the struggle is o'er, and the Charter's won! The time shall come when the artisan Shall homage no more the titled man— When the moiling men who delve the mine By Mammon's decree no more shall pine. Toil, brothers, toil, till the work is done— Till the struggle is o'er and the Charter's won! The time shall come when the weavers' band Shall hunger no more, in their fatherland— When the factory child can sleep till day, And smile while it dreams of sport and play. Toil, brothers, toil, till the work is done— Till the struggle is o'er, and the Charter's won! The time shall come when Man shall hold His brother more dear than sordid gold— When the Negro's stain his freeborn mind Shall sever no more from human—kind. Toil, brothers, toil, till the world is free— Till Justice and Love hold jubilee! The time shall come when kingly crown And mitre for toys of the Past are shown— When the Fierce and False alike shall fall, And Mercy and Truth encircle all. Toil, brothers, toil, till the world is free— Till Mercy and Truth hold jubilee! The time shall come when earth shall be A garden of joy, from sea to sea— When the slaughterous sword is drawn no more, And goodness exults from shore to shore. Toil, brothers, toil, till the world is free— Till goodness shall hold high jubilee! THE WOODMAN'S SONG. I would not be a crownëd king, For all his gaudy gear; I would not be that pampered thing, His gew-gaw gold to wear: But I would be where I can sing Right merrily, all the year; Where forest treen, All gay and green, Full blythely do me cheer. I would not be a gentleman, For all his hawks and hounds,— For fear the hungry poor should ban My halls and wide-parked grounds: But I would be a merry man, Among the wild wood sounds,— Where free birds sing, And echoes ring While my axe from the oak rebounds. I would not be a shaven priest, For all his sloth-won tythe: But while to me this breath is leased, And these old limbs are lithe,— Ere Death hath marked me for his feast, And felled me with his scythe,— I'll troll my song, The leaves among, All in the forest blythe. THE OLD MAN'S SONG. O choose thou the maid with the gentle blue eye, That speaketh so softly, and looketh so shy; Who weepeth for pity, To hear a love ditty, And marketh the end with a sigh. If thou weddest a maid with a bold, staring look, Who babbleth as loud as the rain-swollen brook, Each day for the morrow Will nurture more sorrow,— Each sun paint thy shadow a-crook. The maid that is gentle will make a kind wife; The magpie that prateth will stir thee to strife: 'Twere better to tarry, Unless thou canst marry To sweeten the bitters of life! THE PARADISE OF MARTYRS. A FAITH RHYME. In Five Books DEDICATION. TO WILLIAM EDWARD FORSTER. I dedicate this book to you who sought Me out, when you had read my Prison-Rhyme— Disdainful of what cowards and serviles thought Of one who had worn the fetters for no crime— But only had lived and striven before his time, And let his heart impel him to the deed Of championship defiant for the Poor, Their right to live by labour, and be freed Indeed—not mocked with freedom—on the shore Where Freedom hath her boast. Kindness doth breed Grateful remembrance in the inmost core Of true men's hearts, when done to them in need. Let me be named with those who ne'er forget A kindness: reckoning it a great life-debt. My friend, our lot in stormful time is cast; And who to God and Conscience, reverent, own Inviolable fealty should hold fast Each other's hands, in spite of peasants' frown Or nobles'. Your great path of Duty strown With difficulty may be for many a day; And, sometimes, you may have to strive alone; But shoulder to shoulder with you, in the fray, Shall stand the good and true, when heat is gone, And party spleen,—and all perceive dismay At serried foes doth never cast you down, Nor difficulty your patient courage allay; But your consistent course to all men shews What you are now you will be to Life's close. I shall not live to see your toil complete; But know your steady aim to the end will be Still to preserve Old England the firm seat Of grandest freedom, and to give the key Of knowledge unto all. Felicity The highest that our fatherland can share You wish to see her win: that every child Be trained so wisely and well, it may with care The laws which freemen love keep undefiled, Nor heedless be of holier laws that bear The Maker's fiat. Toiling, unbeguiled By smiles, unquelled by frowns, the pearl still wear Of an unsullied conscience, and your joy Throughout Life's path, no censure shall destroy! THE PARADISE OF MARTYRS. PROËME.

BOOK THE FIRST. 1 Full fleetly, thirty years of strife have flown Since I—the dreamer—in yon prison-hold, Struck my lone harp of rude and cheerless tone, With hand unskilful, and perchance, too bold For dainty ears that love the chords of gold, Touched by sleek charmers, known by accent bland And silken smile; and deem your rhyming scold Of Power and Privilege; a fiery brand That lordly men should quench, in this old queenly land. 2 Full fleetly fly the years! Gray Age hath come, And Mind is slow,—for blood and brain are chilled, And Memory maunders, or her tongue is dumb As death, when she should tell what forms have filled The soul with awe—what joys or throes have thrilled The heart—throughout Life's changeful day: A task that, once, young Memory deftly trilled, And lightly, as a laughing child at play, Till dull Age came, and chid the happy power away. 3 Old Age hath come, and my long-chosen task Is unfulfilled—for, I have loitered long As well as chosen. Yet a man may ask, And wisely, if the loitering hath been wrong: Fools gather wisdom, and the weak grow strong, Not seldom, by delay: good thoughts have grown Where evil flourished. When the fitful throng And tempest of our noon of life are gone, The calm oft comes, in glory, with the setting sun.— 4 Almighty and all-glorious Lord of all! Eternal Source of life, and Fount of light! A poor, dark wanderer, at Thy feet I fall— Forgiving Father, at Thy feet! Thy bright Pervading Presence in the darksome night Of wandering watched me: Thou wert ever near, Although I owned Thee not, and from Thy sight Afar I fled, soul-palsied with the fear That there was nought beyond the tomb: that dread so drear! 5 O God! I thank Thee that I never lost Heart-worship for Thy Son—the Christ—the Blest! That, while my reason wandered, driven and tost From doubt to deeper doubt, until the quest For Truth oft ended in Despair's unrest— The torturous, wild unrest of fell Despair!— Yet, in my gloom, that sorrowing Visage drest In rays of moral beauty seemed to share My sorrow, and to say—“Come hither! learn to bear 6 “My yoke, poor wanderer, and thou shalt find rest: Rest from vain labour: from thy spirit's pain— Swift ease: come hither, to thy Saviour's breast!” Sweet Lord, I come! my labour hath been vain: My search for rest. Unbind my heavy chain Of sin: release me, Saviour, with Thy good And powerful hand: wash out my guilty stain Of rebel pride in Thy atoning blood! In brokenness of heart, I come—my Lord—my God! 7 Thou givest peace not as the world doth give! To me Thy peace be given—that, while this thread Of mortal life is spun, my soul may live For Thee alone; and I may humbly tread My fatherland, from side to side, and spread Thy truth. Help me to preach it to the Poor Who strive to think out, while they toil for bread, The mystery of existence, and explore That sea's vast bounds where mightiest thinkers ne'er found shore! 8 Thou seest them, pitying Father, in their doubt And darkness! And Thy just and sovereign gaze Is fixt upon the mimesters who beclout Themselves anew with rags of Rome, and raise, Once more, for idol, with old pomps, and blaze Of gold, and bannered splendours, and the sheen Of lamps and candles, and the fragrant praise Of incensed-chaunt, their starry-vestured Queen— The lowly mother of the lowly Nazarene! 9 The toiling thousands grope for saving truth, And yearn to find;—but ye seek not to save Your untaught brethren with the words of ruth And tenderness. It is for altars brave, And gay bedizenments, ye hotly crave: Dalmatica, and chasuble, and cope, Biretta, rubied cross, and ivoried stave Episcopal:—to have these toys ye hope— But, for Christ's truth, still let the toiling thousands grope! 10 Out on your childish greed for gew-gaws: toys On which your martyred sires could scarcely look Without a frown! Are there no nobler joys Within your grasp? Have ye for these forsook The simple truths your fathers loved? They shook The Romish slavery off; and freedom, then, Truly became your birthright: if ye brook Meekly the Papal yoke to wear again, Will your sons look ye in the face, and call ye—Men? 11 The toiling thousands think upon the Past, And its fierce martyr-fires; and, while they yearn To fathom Mind's deep mysteries, feel no haste To look for light from darkness, or to learn Lessons from hildings who deserve their scorn. In homely tongue, they ask—“No better tools For digging out the Truth do doctors earn Than these, within their costly halls and schools? Do they build colleges to breed and foster fools?” 12 And then they settle down in doubt, or try A resting-place in restless doubt to find In vain: for, still, the agonising cry, Aloud, is heard of Doubt half-maddening mind; And, still, they grope for Truth—the inly blind! Or, in disgust, they give up thinking;—game And bet, like lords! on horses; and behind Cast care and conscience; or the viler drame Play out of sottishness and sensualism and shame! 13 O for the gift to earth of some great souls! O for the birth of men to found a new And nobler chivalry than decks the rolls Of real or mimic war! O that a few Among the Schooled and Privileged would thew Their wills with high resolve, and grandly rise To throw their hearts among the crowd,—the True To champion, and cast down the forms of Lies— Warriors for Good, old Evil's power to antagonize! 14 Not dead to noble sympathies, and words Fraternal, are the crowd that doubt, and dare The depths of sin. In every heart are chords That vibrate to the touch of humblest player Or lordliest, if responding chords declare Their touch is truly human. Patrons smart And scented,—teachers with the lofty air Of condescension, seem to the stalwart, swart, And sturdy sons of Labour—Things without a heart. 15 How long will this new dotage last—your strife To re-enthrone old Priestcraft? Do ye dream That ye can veritably restore to life The dead putrescence? 'Midst the whirl of steam, The speed of telegraphs, and lightning-gleam Of knowledge which proclaims the Reign of Law, Will toiling men a truth your bold tale deem That ye can make your Maker; and with awe Bow down, in trembling fear of your anathema? 16 They neither fear ye, nor your curse: your creed Is monstrous to their common sense: they pine For rest in Truth, not mockery. Strive to lead The toiling crowd to reverence and enshrine The Real Presence of the Lord Divine Within their hearts, and let your acts reveal That, while ye say ye love the Lord benign, Ye truly serve Him; and, with grateful zeal, Devout, responsive crowds will welcome your appeal.— 17 The night falls fast, and finds me brooding thus O'er evils that afflict my fatherland:— The night falls fast, yet brightly luminous Beam out the cotton mills that round me stand, Where garish gas turns night to day; and hand, And eye, and mind of myriad toilers win The wealth of England, but cannot command A certainty of bread,—though, for her sin, Woman, like man, doth weave, and watch, and toil, and spin. 18 Their toil now ceases, and my toil comes next. I gather them around me, and essay To teach them how to solve the “questions vext” That puzzle and perplex them through the day, Amid the din of wheels, and sweat and fray Of factory life. Some yawn with weariness; Some frown; some sneer; some seem but clods of clay: But some look all aglow with bright excess Of rapt conviction which their minds doth overbless. 19 My task ends all too soon. I wish the hours Could stand; or these till morn could sit, and hear, And think. But drowsiness their frames o'erpowers; And, ere day dawns, they must the call austere O' the factory-bell obey—Toil's chanticleer! But, let it cheer my heart that, through each week I can my task pursue,—although the sere And yellow leaf be mine;—and freely speak— Fearing no frowns, nor listening for applauses sleek. 20 What hand—what stranger hand—shall close these eyes, I cannot know,—or who stretch out my feet; What hushed voice say—“A breathless corpse he lies, His wanderings o'er: prepare the winding-sheet!” Anxious to make my pilgrimage complete, I will work on, rejoicing, let betide What may, on earth. I covet the bright seat He promised them that love Him, close beside His throne of love—my glorious Lord, the Crucified! 21 I fear, no longer, that my being destroyed Shall be, when men shall lay this body low; That Mind shall perish in the mindless void, And I shall cease to think, and feel, and know, Although for ever there shall be the glow Of thought and feeling in God's Universe. The risen Christ with life shall re-endow My soul; and ne'er shall sin again amerce My Christ-enfranchised being with Death's benumbing curse. 22 For ever with my Lord, who said, “I am The Resurrection and the Life,”I trust To be; and to that trust I cleave. Still maim And blind is Mind, and blind and maim it must Remain, how Mind shall live when dust to dust Returns. But, since we cannot know the state Beyond the grave, all-unperturbed robust And patient souls should wait—unfaltering wait, And calmly,—for the spirit-life emancipate.— 23 Midnight hath come. I would that gentle sleep Would visit me; but seldom comes repose, Now age is raught. Thought the long watch doth keep, To wander o'er the Past, with operose And feeble steps, or vainly seeks to unclose The barriers of the Future, till the brain Is worn and wildered. Then, the startled doze Of nervousness succeeds, or, hours of pain; And, seldom, o'er the sense, Sleep spreads her blissful reign. 24 I sought for slumber, and, unwontedly, Sweet Slumber, swiftly, on my eyelids laid Her hand, full gently—as, on mother's knee, A gentle mother's hand is softly stayed Upon her helpless child. Again, I strayed— Or seemed to stray—in spirit, beyond the bound Of earthly life: no longer, now, affrayed With visioned forms that agonised and frowned With rage, or sat in emblemed pomp, enthroned and crowned. An allusion to the Hall of Suicide Kings, in Book I of “The Purgatory of Suicides.” 25 I dreamed I walked the “land of pure delight, Where everlasting spring abides, and never Wither the flowers;”where neither worm nor blight Attaints their bloom, for ever and for ever: Where neither sin nor death again can sever The noble Army of Martyrs from their Lord, Or unto pain again their souls deliver. To Jesu's heaven of bliss, it seemed, I soared, Where myriads of His saints God and the Lamb adored. 26 But I knew not 'twas heaven, as first I woke— Or seemed to wake—when I escaped from earth. Upon my spiritual sight a vision broke So like the “dear, dear land” Dying speech of Gaunt, in Shakspere's Richard II. that gave me birth,— So like the woods, and vales, and hills where mirth And glee were rife in childhood,—that it seemed I had but lately left my Mother's hearth To wander forth, and gather flowers that gleamed With strange, unearthly splendour. Thus I dimly dreamed: 27 I wandered in the pathway of a wood Where delicatest wind-flowers round me lay, Like snow new fall'n; and spring-born bluebells stood, In slender tallness, peering o'er the array Of humble violets and pied pansies gay, With mimic pride; while, waving overhead, Young silken beech-leaves and slim birchen-spray Fleckt the pure light that from above was shed; And still I seemed some well-known woodland path to thread. 28 Yet, evermore, methought, no earthly hue The trees and flowers displayed; while neither cloud Nor shade there seemed to be. And, soon, a new And dazzling light revealed a smiling crowd Of childlike forms—but, dimness, like a shroud, Swiftly enwrapped the vision; and terrene, Again, seemed all things. Then, arose a proud And terraced pile of mountains ever green; And I sped on to reach them, through a lowlier scene. 29 Soft hills sloped gently towards a verdant vale: Like the loved hills that bound thy vale, O Trent!— And, midway, in the valley wound the trail Of a bright river, like a filament Of sparkling silver. On its banks were blent Trent's floral riches—as I did misdeem— The vernal crocus prankt with transient And blushing beauty; cranesbill's sky-born gleam Intense—looking like eyes of angels, in my dream; 30 The huge-leaved butter-bur, with flowers so quaint; Clustered marsh-marigolds that did bedaze My eyes, till I withdrew them by constraint; And still more dazzling was the golden blaze Of water-lilies. Now, again, with rays Of light encircled, childlike creatures smiled Upon me. Unaffrayed, but in a maze I stood; for none looked like an earth-born child: They seemed too pure for souls derived from men defiled. 31 “What are ye, beauteous things?” methought I spake. Silent, they beckoned me with smiles of grace; And dimness soon again seemed to o'ertake My vision—for, they faded till no trace Remained of their bright forms. I trod, apace, The vale, yearning to win the height sublime O' the terraced mountains; but the winning face Of some fair flower, so dear to childhood's time, Brought back my thoughts, in wonder still, to childhood's clime. 32 What virgin purity the flowers that grew Nigh the bright winding river seemed to wear— Sweet cicely, and meadow-sweet, and rue! And cuckoo-flowers and chervils bloomed so fair, They were as magnets to my eyes; and there I lingered, when I fain would have begone To climb the mountains, and behold what rare Large prospect from their summits might be won Of that rich floral realm so sweetly halcyon. 33 I stooped to pluck a lily from the marge Of the fair river, since it grew so near, And bloomed so dazzling white and grandly large; But, ere I touched it, suddenly in my ear Streamed music, soft as whispers, and yet clear And sweet as that sweet “Pastoral Symphony” Oft heard on earth—the dulcet harbinger Of lofty praise, and holy and heavenly glee: Charmed prelude to the burst of angel minstrelsy. 34 Still sweeter grew the sounds, and fairer bloomed The flowers, till rapt thoughts strengthened that I trode No earthly soil, but precincts to bliss-doomed Celestial realms, where vigour is bestowed On franchised souls to fit them for their load Of bliss—the “weight of glory” which they bear— “Far more exceeding and eternal,”—who see God: They who eternal joys beyond compare Esteem, with “light affliction”saints on earth may share. 35 The thought that I was heir of bliss so great, And that earth's life of sin and sorrow and pain Was past, began, well-nigh, to tribulate The soul with ecstasy: an overgain Of bliss, it seemed, for one who knew the stain Of sin—though all forgiven—henceforth to dwell With endless joy. But soon, in tuneful strain, Some unseen choral band, with jubilant swell, Above, around me, pealed these words delectable:— 36 “Spirit, rejoice! thy mortal life is past: This land of living light no cloud can gloom: Sin cannot reach it, with her fatal blast: Here flowers can never fade, but ever bloom: Here pain, or sin-bred anguish cannot come: Death vanquisheth Man's dust, but not the soul: Man's spirit is no tenant of the tomb— No prisoner to the grave. Rejoice, thy dole Is ended; and thy soul hath reached her happy goal! 37 “Welcome, new heritor of bliss! begin To enter on thy rest. Let no alloy, Or thought that thou hast known the stain of sin, Lessen thy rapture, or thy bliss destroy. Onward, and prove the fulness of that joy Thy Saviour promised. He thy debt hath paid, And thou art free! Prepare for blest employ Through countless ages! Joys that never fade Are thine: increasing joys thy essence shall pervade! 38 “Onward, and join the dear companions blest Thou soon shalt meet: they who thy Saviour loved And served, and openly His Name confessed; Nor to deny their Lord were weakly moved When bad men threatened, but were faithful proved Through lives of suffering, and in deaths of shame: They who proclaimed that holy truth behoved Their bodies should be given unto the flame With joyous haste, so they might homage Jesu's Name!” 39 The glittering band of childlike creatures beamed Above me, as the jubilant strain surceased, That, now I knew, was theirs. Then, as I dreamed, They vanished; and I entered on glad quest For some I yearned to see among the Blest— Some who the martyr's crown obtained by faith, In fiery flames, and nobly did attest The power of faith to draw the sting of death: Who died exulting in their Lord with their last breath! 40 My fatherland's intrepid martyrs were The souls I longed to meet; and wish devout I felt to gaze on reverend Latimer,— The memory of whose nobleness oft wrought Deep love within me, in my days of doubt And wandering. Forthwith, as in dungeoned plight, Another allusion to “The Purgatory of Suicides,” Book I Stanza 36 The soul with intellective power seemed fraught To realize her wish; and, clothed with light, The grand old martyr was revealed unto my sight! 41 And with him Ridley walked, in radiant dress Of pure white robes; and garland-crowns they wore Of flowers that did transcend in beauteousness And splendour the fair flowers upon the shore Of the bright river, though I deemed, before, These were all-peerless. Hand in hand appeared The shining martyrs. As, for Christ, of yore, To burn together they nor shrunk, nor feared, So were they to each other, now, in bliss endeared. 42 That his brave death-words rose within my mind, Seemed quickly known unto the martyred sire; And, that I feared their failure, he divined: Whereat—unknowing that blest souls in higher Ascents of purity the power acquire To read their brethren's thought—I, speechless, stood In wonder. Bravely, as if he marched the fire Again to welcome with old hardihood, He upward glanced, and thus his faith unshaken shewed:— 43 “Fear not, young heir of heaven! harbour no doubt That Truth shall triumph. Falsehood's fellest power The candle never shall again put out We lighted up for England, in that hour We dared the flame,—while, 'mong the crowds from tower And hall and cloister, some that saw the deed With fear at first, felt soon they would not cower 'Fore tenfold tortures; and, in flames, did read This truth: the ‘Martyrs' blood shall be the Church's seed!’ 44 “Fear not for Truth—for Christ's own glorious Truth! Falsehood may, yet, put forth spasmodic force, Again and oft, and vaunt her purity and youth, Though every step of her foul crooked course Speaks her decrepit. Despots may endorse Her lies for truth, to prop their crumbling thrones; And fools the gay-trickt harridan may nurse And fondle; but rotten are her very bones: Her scrannel songs scarce serve to drown her dying groans. 45 “Onward, young heir of Jesu's happy heaven! We go on messages of mercy sweet, Once more, to earth: such blest employ hath given The Lamb to His glad saints. Thee soon shall greet Dear souls familiar by their names: thy meet And loving teachers: till a convoy bright Of angels, swift, shall bring thee to the feet Of Jesus throned, amid His saints in white; And thou shalt worship with them in supernal light!” 46 Away, they sped!—the shining Martyr pair— On their blest errand, with most eager love, To do their loving Master's will. To share Their work, methought, I coveted, and strove To follow them. But, sweetest strains above, Around me swelled, until I sank o'erpowered With ecstasy of sweetness—though I longed to prove The service of that heaven where saints adored, In myriad throngs of love, their glorious risen Lord. 47 “Onward, still onward!”—did the sweet chaunt swell, From unseen choristers—“Thou wilt not find Thy rest in rapture. They on earth who dwell Miss their chief happiness because, with blind Perception of true bliss, they stay behind To reap the lesser joys that virtue gives, And toil not for the greater. God designed The soul for duty; and he who, tireless, strives To render duteous service unto God derives 48 “Still higher bliss from every duteous deed. God did engraft in moral natures sense Of praise and blame; and holiest natures feed On consciousness of duty done, and thence Derive, for God's sweet service, more intense And holy and earnest zeal: blest avarice It is, to covet largest opulence Of zeal for duty: who rest in rapture miss True good: eternal service is eternal bliss!” 49 And, now, grew visible a glorious band Of spirits I seemed intuitively to know: The gallant Martyrs of my fatherland: Our noble Cobham; Hooper, the firm foe Of slavish pomps; young Bilney, with faith's glow Exultant; praying Bradford—devotee So true and holy; Philpot, with the brow Of high intelligence; Anne Askew, she Who cheered her fellow-sufferers with such holy glee; 50 And melancholy Mary's victims: Rogers, first On whom her priests, watching like wolves for prey, Contrived to slake their sanguinary thirst; Saunders, who burnt at Coventry; and they— A hero-crowd besides—who, in the day Of vengeful Gardiner, and power of Rome Retrieved, and Bonner's savage zeal to slay,— In Smithfield left their ashes, without gloom Clasping the flames, triumphing in their fiery doom. 51 With these came Bainham, who, when fire had raged And burned his nether limbs, aloud proclaimed “This is a bed of roses!”—so assuaged His faith fierce pain! The weaver humble-named, Too,—Tomkins,—'neath whose wrist a taper flamed, Held by brute Bonner, who thus vainly thought To fright his victim; Hawkes, who threw his maimed And burning arms aloft, to quell the doubt Of trembling lovers who this sign of him had sought; 52 Hunter, the gentle boy whose mother and sire Rejoiced that God to them so brave a child Had given, to bear Him witness in the fire; Farrar, who, at Caermarthen, his foes foiled So stoutly in the flames; Tindal, who toiled For future ages, and received the crown Of martyrdom,—by treachery foul beguiled; With steadfast Lambert, who the tiger frown Undaunted bore of Henry seated on his throne. 53 Brave Rowland Taylor with this martyred host Came nobly on. But there was one aside Who walked, as if for him there were no boast Among his brethren—no exultant pride: 'Twas Cranmer, seeming with himself to chide, Even in heaven! With these came many more Who burned in England; while, great souls allied In faith and fervour, whom in her heart's core Of reverence faithful Scotland long hath proudly bore, 54 Came with them: noble Hamilton, whom proud And sensual Beatoun dragged to death, but fell, Himself a victim to his country's loud Demand for vengeance; holy Wishart, well And worthily ranked with martyrs vincible By neither man nor demon; Renwick bold; With crowds whom Power and Priestcraft could not quell: The men who did the Solemn Covenant hold As sacred:—men of high, heroic, martyr mould. 55 I saw this shining host, and knew the chaunt Was theirs; and one upraised me with a smile; And on I journeyed with them, while descant They joined, how holy joys the spirit thrill That thirsts some higher duty to fulfil, Nor counts on rapture for reward, or ease, Or rest, but evermore to service still Aspires; and how the soul new service sees Before it, ever; and thus eternal pleasures please. 56 And then, conversing of the work they loved, They told each other of the sights just seen On earth,—for, soon, my wistful spirit proved That these glad souls to mother Earth had been, To cheer God's children in their earthly teen,— And how they loved the loving sweet employ: And then, by turns, they drew some picture sheen Of holy suffering and of holy joy, And patient faith and trust no suffering could destroy. 57 Some told of mother's love, and watchings pale, Beside a dying child; and some pourtrayed The dread heartbrokenness that bowed a frail Old man whom Death had robbed of all the aid— The earthly aid—he had, and lowly laid His loving life-companion in the grave; While some rehearsed how pining sorrow preyed Upon the hearts of children who, to save Their dying parents, watched them with devotion brave. 58 And some depictured how a virgin flower Of loveliness no words could tell declined Upon its fragile stem, from hour to hour— A loving maid beloved: two intertwined And beauteous natures: in the youth the mind, And in the maid the form, being fair as heaven; And how she slept in death, and the youth pined Away in grief, for that all bliss seemed given With her on earth: with her all bliss away was riven! 59 The shipwrecked sailor, in the ocean wide— Others described—and how his last lorn prayer Was for his bosom's love, the tender bride He left on land, far off—the home so fair He decked so daintily, with shells so rare And foreign beauteous things; and how the dread Mysterious boding in her heart despair Succeeds, and daily her tears for him are shed, Long ere some lone survivor tells her he is dead. 60 And others told of negro slaves, and pain And torture meekly borne by many a thrall Who never breathed offence to those for gain Who bought and sold him, but obeyed their call To wait and toil when he could scarcely crawl To do their fiendish bidding. Others shewed How some bore ignominy that would not fall Before men's idols, though it seemed the load Would crush them: still the knee to Baal they never bowed. 61 The noble courage, in the Battle of Life, Of peaceful warriors—others eulogised; The men who with vindictiveness and strife And hate and malice, daily agonised; And strove to show mankind howe'er they prized Red Victory's brow with laurel chaplet green, Her real features were the Fiend's disguised. And then they shewed how all who tried to wean Men from War's madness suffered persecution keen. 62 With loving grief—such grief as saints can feel In heaven—some told of hard oppression borne By a poor widow, toiling at the wheel Or loom, with hungered frame, sore weary and worn, To keep her fatherless ones from sin and scorn,— Yet meeting sympathy from none—but sneers From bestial tempters she doth meekly spurn. And how the meek one leans on Him Who hears His saints' low cry, and bottles up His tried ones' tears. 63 And then they spoke of heavenly condolence They bore to sorrowers: strength to fortify The suffering with belief in Providence That fills the cup of grief and trial nigh Unto the brim in wisdom, and doth try His saints in love, but never lets the cup Run o'er; that counts each tear, that hears each sigh, Of all His contrite ones; and, when they droop, Sends heavenly help to bear their fainting spirits up. 64 Of resignation, and of steadfast faith When bad men persecute the good, and rage And threaten them with chains and torturous death, They told;—and how, on holy embassage They went to bear such help, their lineage Of suffering rendering them the bearers meet. And gratefully, they said—Mind could not gauge The Love Divine that sent them forth to greet And strengthen struggling saints by earthly foes beset; 65 And that themselves, thus, with the Paraclete Divine should share the work of comforting God's saints was a reward ineffably sweet; And had they known what the Eternal King Designed them for, it would have drawn the sting Of torture in their martyrdom till praise Had filled their souls; and, like a bird on wing, Each would have soared, exultant, with glad lays, Above all thought of pain, in the devouring blaze! 66 Thus while they held sweet descant, glode Around us, oft, bands of the bright young quire I saw when first I seemed the blest abode Of saints to enter; and I felt desire Grow strong to know them. Ne'er seemed they to tire But ever floated on, with rapturous eyne Betokening how they did the speech admire Of God's glad martyrs, who the scheme benign Extolled that did to them sweet ministering work assign. 67 Ere I could ask, one answered my thought's quest. “These are,” said he, “but scanty companies Of that great myriad army of the Blest Of which they all are numbered. Hither, when hies A soul from earth, these meet it, and surprise The welcome soul with sounds and looks of love, And thus prepare it for the exercise Of all the powers within its essence wove By the Great Maker, that it may for ever prove 68 “The blessedness of being, which God hath given. These are the souls of infants: they of whom The Saviour said of such the kingdom of heaven Is. Deem thou not He meant they hither come As if heaven were all infants' bright heirloom By native right of innocency. Each soul From Adam born is born in sin; and doom Of sin these 'scape, because Christ suffered dole For them, and makes, by grace, their sin-grained spirits whole. 69 “Of such the kingdom of heaven is; and young They are for ever! Thus, by Divine decree, They who by actual sin of thought or tongue Were never stained do first salute the free And happy souls who join our jubilee In heaven. Old sin-stained earth they visit never, Since sin or guilt they never knew: while we Revisit sin's abode: the Great Life-giver Thus serving, thus His service blest enjoying ever!” 70 Soon seemed we to have raught the mountains green, And up their terraced sides, untoiling, climbed, Beholding myriad forms so bright, the sheen Of all earth's gold and gems would have been dimmed Beside their beauty. Countenances sublimed From mortal care and fear and doubt they wore; And, as they clomb the mountains, sweetly hymned Their grateful joy, their earthly fight being o'er, Of sin the stain and torture they should know no more. 71 They sang not praise because from fiery flame, Or fiercer bodily pain, they were set free,— Although they out of great tribulation came;— But joyous hymns they sang set to the key Of purest love, because their leprosy Of guilt was cleansed, and o'er them sin's dread reign,— By Him Who captive led captivity,— Was broken, never to be resumed again: Thus, as they climbed, they sang their ever grateful strain:— 72 “We come, O God, from holy work on earth, To adore in heaven Thy glorious majesty!— Father of all, and Son who once had birth 'Mong sinful men, and Holy Spirit, Three In One, the Triune God!—to bow the knee With all for whom Christ's precious blood hath streamed, And angels fair!—to join heaven's jubilee, With all the fallen whom Thou hast redeemed, And all on whom for aye Thy unbroken smile hath beamed! 73 “For ever blessed be Thy Holy Name! Great Giver of existence and of thought! Let all Thy saints return Thee sweet acclaim For all the wonders which Thy hand hath wrought— For all the bliss with which our life is fraught— For all Thy long-forbearance when the sway Of rebel Sin we owned, and foully fought Against Thy sovereign love, from day to day. We bless Thee that Thou didst not cast our souls away! 74 “For ever blessed be Thy Holy Name! Thou didst in mercy seek Thy wandering sheep, When, lost in sin, and lost to sense of shame, We wandered still, and had no will to creep Back to Thy feet in penitence, and weep To have such love as Thine so vilely spurned. Great God, what wondrous mercy dost Thou keep For men! We never had to Thee returned, Hadst Thou not sought us: never should for sin have mourned. 75 “But Thou didst love us, and dost love men still— E'en sinful men on earth; Thou dost not leave Them in their sins, and helplessness of ill: Them Thou dost seek, and grant a long reprieve To their rebellion—drawing them to grieve For sin, and win Thy sweet forgiving love! Thy sweet forgiving love we feel, and cleave To Thee, as all Thy saints in heaven have clove For ages; and for aye Thy loving smile shall prove! 76 “We bless Thy Holy Name we never here Shall grieve Thy holiness, indulge desire Or thought of sin, or ever feel a fear Of falling! Evermore in us the fire Divine shall burn to love Thee, and acquire Still holier zeal; for Thou wilt guide our aim To serve Thee, while to Thee our souls aspire, And still wilt feed in us the holy flame! For ever and ever blessed be Thy Holy Name!” 77 So sang the myriad shining forms that climbed The mountains ever green. And, as I glanced Along their ranks, I saw their steps were timed: So that in triumph-march the hosts, entranced With joy, up by the terraces advanced,— While newer hosts of shining ones, from earth, Still more their numbers and their joys enhanced,— For upward still they clomb, all sending forth The pæans of their grateful joy and holy mirth. 78 Lo! when the hosts the mountain heights had won, How shall I tell the glory of my dream?— The golden crystal walls before us shone— Those lofty walls adorned with sparkling gem Of every name; and those twelve gates with beam Resplendent of one matchless pearl:—the blest Apocalyptic vision God did deem Him worthy of who on the loving breast Of Christ, on earth, so often found a loving rest! 79 The new Jerusalem—the home, I saw, Of God's dear saints for whom the Lamb's own blood Was shed; and on the angels gazed with awe, Who, at the pearly gates o' the City of God, In panoply of light, as keepers, stood. I thought their eyes pierced through me—but, behold! They oped the mighty gates; and, like a flood, The Martyr-hosts—who in their Lord were bold— Streamed in, with songs of triumph, on the floor of gold! 80 I went not with them; for methought the band With which I marched, to whom heaven's realm was new, Were marshalled by an angel with a wand Of silver, till he other bands outdrew From the great host; and soon he loudly blew The golden trumpet which hung by his side— And forth from out the gates a convoy flew Of wingëd seraphim, who smiling cried: “The Lamb unto the marriage-supper calls the Bride! 81 “Come in, ye blessed of the Lord, come in! Receive the mansions by your Lord prepared: The glorious Crown of Life ye now shall win! His truth and love ye have on earth declared: With Him the hate of wicked men ye shared: And though ye were not called to prove your faith In the fierce flames which His confessors dared, Ye have been faithful in your lives, till death. Come in! receive from His own hands the blooming wreath 82 “Of immortality. Come in, come in, Ye blessed of the Lord! receive the bright Reward!—the crown of glory ye shall win!”— And now we seemed upborne on bands of light By the winged seraphim, with gentle flight, Into the City of God, even to the throne Of God and of the Lamb: into the sight, All-glorified, of Him who wore the crown Of thorns, but now gives crowns of life unto His own! 83 Vision of holiest love, how shall I tell Thy sweetness!—or the splendour of that brow Of awfullest majesty, for earthlings spell In characters that men may read! O may I know That smile ineffable when hence I go To meet my Judge!—but all earth's languaged lore Could not my soul with potency endow To tell my dream: all earth-made speech were poor To unveil the glory that the King in His beauty were! 84 The plenitude of pardon for all sin: Eternal freedom from all sin and stain: Welcome to mansions that should now begin, And never fail—eternal welcome!—Pain For ever ended, under His sweet reign Of health, and light, and love, and bliss!—Largess Of knowledge bounteous: things obscure made plain: The soul become, in heaven, close auditress Of the Eternal Word, whose accents overbless 85 The high archangels, as the saints in light: Rapt consciousness no ceasing there should be Of His all-gladdening smile: no darkening night Of error—but bright perpetuity Of rectitude: the soul from wrong set free, That growth in wisdom of His works and ways Might fill her enlarging powers with ecstasy,— So that all souls, for aye, should grateful raise To the All-Blest, All-Blessing One, their gladsome praise! 86 All mortal words are mean! More, far, of love— Love bliss-endowing, bliss-entrancing, dwelt In that one look that, from the throne above, Glanced on my soul, than all the soul hath felt On earth of joys in tenderness that melt Our nature. And 'twas bliss ALL felt; and ALL In speechless awe of overbliss, now knelt, And loved, and worshipped, while it seemed to appal The soul to experience bliss so beatifical! 87 Ten thousand times ten thousand harps of gold, Tuned by the fingers of the angelic throng, Forthwith began sweet prelude to unfold— Harmonious prelude trumpets did prolong Of cherub and seraph—to the choral song Of all the host, unfallen and redeemed, Of highest heaven. What voices, clear and strong, Led the vast choir? They on whose foreheads beamed The mark the Lamb had set: His Martyrs diademmed! 88 “Worthy the Lamb, that once for men was slain— For sinful men!”—the holy martyrs cry. “Worthy, redeeming Lord, Thou art to reign”— Responded myriad angels holy and high— “Who didst Thyself the souls of sinners buy From endless pain; and didst Thy Father's rule Of righteousness for ever justify!” “We bow,” the archangels cried, “at Thy footstool, O co-eternal Son, divinely pitiful!” 89 “O Father!” sang all heaven, “we laud Thy Name For Thy eternal purpose made so clear In giving Him to suffering and to shame— Thy only begotten Son, so loved and dear Unto Thy heart divine—who hath no peer In all created life—Thy Son, who hath In Thine own bosom ever dwelt, that here, In this Thy heaven of love, men, saved by faith In Him, might live: for ever saved from Thy just wrath!” 90 “O Spirit Divine!” sang on the general host Of men and angels, “we adore Thy pure Long-suffering love for man! O Holy Ghost, Who didst so long the sight of sin endure— Whose purity hath striven the foul to cure, And conquered!—by whose sovereign breath Sinners were born again,—their forfeiture Of heaven was cancelled,—and they found the path Up hither, by Thy light: made heirs of heaven, through faith!” 91 “Eternal Triune God!” sang ransomed men And sinless babes, and principalities And powers, and holy creatures with the ken All-spiritual—the creatures full of eyes!— And angel and archangel companies, And cherubim and seraphim; and, from The macrocosm of God, myriads of guise And form man cannot name, devoutly come To welcome God's loved saints to their eternal home: 92 “Eternal Triune God! Who wert, and art, And art to come! Thrice holy, sovereign One! Thyself sole Life, who dost their life impart To all that live—Thyself sole Mind, the boon To know who giv'st to all that think—sole Sun The light who giv'st to all that live and feel— Sole Strength, their strength who giv'st to all that on The solid worlds or ether move—reveal Thyself who dost, in glory and love unspeakable! 93 “We hymn Thy everlasting love, O Lord! Thy love which gives us happy life, in thought And act, Thy will in doing, and the reward For ever finding in our work. Full fraught Are all Thy works with love; and, by Thee taught, For ever, thus, we work in love, and find Our bliss enlarging ever; nor shall aught Restrain or bound the bliss Thou hast designed For all that do Thy will: the bliss with service joined. 94 “O God, our greatest bliss is that we love Thee, and Thou lovest us. And Thou hast made Us capable of loving more, and wove In all our natures powers that, well essayed In Thy blest service, Thou wilt ever aid And strengthen, till for higher service still Our being is fitted, and our thoughts all stayed On Thy perfections. Father, let Thy will Be done! With that desire alone our spirits fill! 95 “Thy will is happiness to all that live. It was Thy everlasting love that moved Thee to create, and happy life to give. No other life Thou ever gav'st. They roved From blessedness to bale, and swiftly proved Their folly, who misused the freedom fair Thou didst endow them with: for, it behoved All spiritual natures should be free,—to share Thy blest approval, or Thy righteous blame to bear. 96 “Thy wisdom, as Thy power and love, adored For ever be, by all that think and know! We see not all Thy purposes, O Lord! Not yet—although throughout the ages grow Our essences in knowledge—do they glow With full perception of Thy works and ways. All-perfect One, Thou hast no yoke-fellow! Afar, full oft, in awe we stand and gaze, Or sink beneath the effulgence of Thy glory's rays! 97 “We see not all Thy purposes, or aim. If through the ages Ill survive, though Good For ever with it war, and no reclaim For evil-doers be found; if still the proud Submit not to Thy rule, repentant bowed, At length, 'fore Thy high will so holy and bright— Thy all-wise will be done! For us, no cloud Can hide the truth that Thou art true; and right Are all Thy ways, O Holy Dweller in the Light! 98 “We know Thy will is that, like Thee, we war Unceasingly with Evil, and condole With those that suffer: that, to still the jar Of disobedience in each human soul, In Thy blest sight is blessed. No control We have o'er loftier essences that fell From holiness and bliss. If in the roll Of ages, spiritual powers who now rebel Shall to Thy love return—O Lord, it shall be well— 99 “For, such return unto Thy arms of love— Unto Thy heart, that yearns all being to bless— Shall to Thy saints and angels grateful prove Thy wisdom, in its depths, how fathomless!— How perfectly the spotless, bright impress Of love is stamped on Thy great government, Through all Thy realms of life and boundlessness!— O Thou who art alone all-prescient, Thy holy will be done—O Lord, all-excellent! 100 “Now round Thy throne again we grateful crowd, And join our praise for all Thy goodness past, Present, to come;—for all, with which endowed Of intellect and strength, we feel Thou hast Blest our existence! Giver of goodness vast, Interminable, as of life, we hymn The wondrous love with which Thou hast embraced Alike, the wanderers who Thy gifts bedim, But seek forgiveness,—and Thy steadfast seraphim! 101 “All praise be Thine—not ours—for constancy Of service. Left, unguided, uninspired, Unaided, unimpelled, O Lord, by Thee, The brightness even of those Thou hast attired With crowns of splendour, near Thee, had expired In darkest wanderings of the will: the speed With which we haste to go, with fervour fired, Afresh, perpetually, on holy deed, Had sunk to slowness, didst Thou not our fervour feed. 102 “Thy gladdening smile we feel to be our life: And life it gives us now; happy, renewed Existence, with the will and powers all rife With zeal for high employ and amplitude Of service: neither with less zest imbued For lowliest work—so that we shelter fling Round Thine own saints who suffer in the feud With Evil,—or bold rebels, humbled, bring Low at Thy feet in tearful penitence to cling. 103 “We see the sign of love beneath Thy feet, That now, with energy renewed, we do Again on earth our errands. When we meet Once more around Thy throne in bliss to bow— Another round of duty done—not slow, We trust, we shall have proved in zeal for Thine All-righteous rule. Go with us, Father, go!— Or vigour of saint and angel shall decline, And we shall fail to execute Thy will benign. 104 “The presence of Thy visible glory, Lord, We leave; but let us feel Thee ever near, Where'er we go, and that Thou dost afford Us loving aid while, serving in Thy fear, We do our works of love. O Father! drear The spaces of Thy universe would be Without Thyself. Blest Father! ever cheer Thy sons with consciousness that, while they flee To do Thy will, Thou still art with them: they with Thee!’ 105 Their choral praise was ended; but my rhyme Is all unworthy of the theme. Inane Were all attempts the choir of that pure clime Of highest heaven, and their ecstatic strain Of holiest worship, with the grand refrain, So oft repeated, of their grateful joy, To celebrate. To leave God's high domain They now prepared, in lower realms employ To share: to help the Good, or Evil to destroy. 106 Bright order still they kept. Who led the van? God's holy Martyrs—with no banner spread, Or ensign—but they, first, with zeal began The crystal walls to pass—to join the dread Encounter, still, with Evil: firm their tread Upon the golden floor! And, marshalled forth By resident seraphim of heaven, were led To the gates the myriad host, beside—on earth, Or other realms of God where first their souls had birth, 107 To re-enjoy their work for Him—their high And rapturous toil of love and service blest. The resident seraphs, and the beasts that cry— Saying, “Holy, holy, holy!”—and never rest— The spiritual creatures full of eyes—and drest In white, the Elders crowned, who, by the sea All-hyaline, before the Throne, attest Likewise, perpetually, the sanctity Of God Almighty—by His loving, high decree, 108 Remained in heaven—to me, to know 'twas given— Ever with rapt and holy worship, there: Within the Lamb's own light, in highest heaven Remained to praise. I heard a voice declare: “Thou shalt return!” as I the precincts fair Of bliss prepared to leave. A thrill of bliss Awoke me; and I, trembling, breathed a prayer: “Lord! let me not by sin, or cowardice In the discharge of duty, the blest guerdon miss 109 “Of joys ineffable, in Thy glad realm Of heaven! Henceforth, through every waking hour Let me be breathing prayer! If trouble whelm My spirit, and dark shapes of evil lour Upon me—even in the hour and power Of darkness, Saviour, let me feel Thee near! Through Thee, let me be more than conqueror O'er sin, and sloth, and pride, and doubt, and fear; And then, Thy voice saying, ‘Come up hither!’ let me hear!” BOOK THE SECOND. 1 Come forth, my Love! Old Winter, harsh and frore, Flees the young vernal Sun! Come forth, my Love! Let us renew sweet childhood's joys once more: Once more return with merriment to rove Adown the dear old lanes, through the loved grove, O'er mead, and marsh, and pasture! Though with lithe And limber steps we can no longer move, The flowers will laugh around us! Ere Death's scythe Shall reach us, let us share again Spring-pleasures blythe! 2 What say'st thou, Love—“Will there be flowers in heaven?” They should grow there, Love, for thine own sweet sake. But, while on earth we stay, and flowers are given To us on earth so lovely that they make Our hearts rejoice within us, and oft wake A wonder whether saints in bliss behold Aught that doth seem more truly to partake Of rapturous loveliness than flowers unfold Of loveliness on earth, though only of earth's mould, 3 Let us go forth, and look into their eyes Of love, once more! Old faces, ever new, Men would look fondlier on ye, were they wise: Ye harbour no ingratitude: the view Of your bright beauty breeds no spite: your hue And splendour raise no jealousies: content Is your inheritance, and ye subdue Aspiring thoughts in man: most eloquent Is your frail life how briefly mortal life is spent! 4 How oft your mute but holy chaplainship Hath led the heart of man to holiest prayer: Heart prayer: more true than orisons o' the lip! Still let me seek ye in the freshening air Of morn; and as ye ope your eyes so fair And look towards heaven,—upward I'll look With grateful love, and humbly cast my care On Him who careth for ye, in your nook Wherein so lowlily ye nestle. In His Book 5 I learn He loved ye, when He walked on earth With lowly men, and taught them that the king So wealthy and wise was not, with all his girth Of glorious robes and jewels glistering, Arrayed like one of ye!— Welcome, sweet Spring— My natal time!—How I could love to live For ever here, if thou wert garlanding The earth, alway. Thanks, rather, let me give For joys thou giv'st: this life of joy is fugitive! 6 Come forth, my Love! the sorrel of the wood— Thy darling tenderling—in mossy shade Now blossoms fair, the bluebell is in bud; And the frail windflower and the primrose fade. O violet sweet! hath thy rich hue dismayed Thy pale companions?—Let's to the brooklet's edge! See how the turbaned geum hath displayed Its pride!—Step hither, darling, through the sedge: 'Twill glad thine eyes: I've found the golden saxifrage! 7 Hark! 'tis the cuckoo: Spring's true harbinger! We all feel sure 'tis Spring—'tis life renewed— When that quaint note—quaint, yet beloved—we hear! How wondrous 'twas in childhood! All unviewed, The curious voice with ardour we pursued, Imagining the wood, the vale, the hill Contained it,—nor desire to run subdued Easily, though out of breath! How like our will To follow fancies that can ne'er the wide soul fill! 8 List, list again! the stock-dove coos her coy But fervent love; that lowly minor song The yellow-hammer sings brings back the joy Of early years; the linnet perched among The golden gorse doth tenderly prolong Old, sweet remembrances; while, overhead, The soaring lark, in anthems clear and strong, Leads back desire to joys that will bestead The yearning soul most truly while on earth we tread. 9 But, list again! How tear the heart away From earth, while listening to yon flute of gold The blackbird sweetly plays? What powerful sway Hath such rapt music for the soul! Oh cold, Relentless Death! how I thy power controlled Could wish, that I might ever stay on earth And listen to her music manifold! What wonder that her music and her mirth Have such enchantment for a thing of earthly birth? 10 What tiny woodman's axe rings lightly down Our path? Lo, yonder to the rotten tree Clings the green-feathered worker, with his crown Of burning crimson! With what saucy glee The bar-winged jay and magpie laugh to see Their neighbour's toil! Let idlers all deride— He works in earnest, having found the key To unlock the insect treasures that there hide: Well done, fair bird! work on, whether they laugh or chide! 11 Shall we press inward, to the thicket dern, Where rare Herb Paris springs, and orchids flout The mystic stranger, 'mid young snake-curled fern? Hark! in the swamp, how merrily the rout Of snow-white crowfoots seem to sing and shout: “We are as fair as lilies!” Many a year, Loved lilies of the vale! with hope devout, In vain, I've sought ye, and begin to fear The music of your fairy bells I shall not hear 12 As in Lea Wood I heard it, when-a child, Love-guided by my brave dear mother's hand, I went to pluck ye, and my mother smiled, Forgetting her oppressors 'midst the bland And gladdening smile of Spring. 'Midst yon bright band I soon shall meet her—for, in Christ she died! Sweet Lord, I thank Thee, that in Thy glad land No woe or weeping shall the Poor betide: No more their souls shall ache beneath the scourge of Pride! 13 Away, old sorrows of the heart, away! How surely do your memories live, though years, We think, have buried them! But now sweet May Hath come, this is no time for sorrow's tears. Let tears flow, rather, from the fount that nears The fount of sorrow, in the soul: so twin Is all our nature! on the face that wears The clouds of sorrow radiant joys soon shine; And smiles to tears, soft, whisper—“Lo, we are akin!” 14 “It is the merry, merry month of May!”— So sang we in our childhood; and the song Let us sing cheerily 'mong the flowers so gay! They are not fallen to sin, or stained with wrong. O give us of your pureness, happy throng Of virgin starworts!—your untainted show Of beauty seems more truly to belong To bliss, because so near the ground ye blow: Even fairest flowers seem happiest when they humbly grow. 15 And humble as thy name doth thee betoken, Lowly ground-ivy, not a cultured flower Of which we hear words superfine fairspoken,— Whether in trim parterre or lady's bower, Or grand conservatory,—holds a dower Of richer splendour than thy purple dye! Nor seems the dahlia, in its robes of power, More beautiful than thy meek fairy eye, And tinct serene, as of the noon-day summer sky, 16 Dear speedwell, that so modestly dost cower Under the hedgerow! Pilewort, with its sheen Of gold, and daisy silver-rayed,—the flower So dear to every child!—with lovelier mien, Seem to gaze on us from their couch of green Upon the ground, than if they did look down From lofty boughs of lordly forest treen. From lofty things we rather fear a frown, Than look that smiles by them upon the earth be strown. 17 What hast thou found?—the fairy moschatel? How fitly did the wise and reverent Swede “Unglorying” name it! He named all things well— The lowly interpreter of Nature: freed From base self-worship, all things did him lead To enthrone the All-Worshipful, and trace His hand Of tireless care and wisdom in each weed, Each winged and creeping thing, proud man hath banned, As much as in the beautiful, the gay, the grand. 18 There goes the startled throstle from her nest! Come, let us seek for it, but not destroy Or rudely touch its precious treasure, lest The bird should grieve when she comes back to pry If all be safe. Eureka!—when a boy, If I had found five eggs so beauteous blue And speckled, I should have gone wild with joy! I wish I had found out the value true Of other pretty things I did so long pursue 19 Only to find them valueless and void Of aught to make man happier. How the eyes, The ears, the taste, and every sense beside, Deceive us!—and, when undeceived, what sighs We heave to be deceived again! Disguise It as we may, the winsome world we deem So false is chiefly our own making. Lies Will sparkle as if writ with Truth's own beam To minds content to rest on hopes that only seem. 20 Our steps grow weary, Love! Let us wend home— Though home we share no longer, as in days Gone by. Worn pilgrims, through the world we roam, Calling no cot “our own,” kindling no blaze On our own hearth, bidding a friend who pays His evening visit “welcome!” now, no more. What then? We know no want: so let us raise Our thankful hearts unto the Great Bestower: Life shall be Duty while it lasts; 'twill soon be o'er! 21 My evening task wrought out, once more, when sleep Imperfectly again had shut out sense Of outward things—which, evermore, we threap, Are real and true, while but a fraudulence Of brain o'er-busy 'tis, or indigence Of gastric power, that fills the mind with dreams,— I dreamt again that I had audience Of martyred souls in converse on high themes: A company brightly clad with heaven's own glorious beams. 22 The Martyrs' names ybore of reverence—names A false religion teaches men should hold As mediatorial. But, I wis, no claims On earth they made so arrogant and bold; And their descant in heaven left all untold Such fictions of old Priestcraft. Holy Paul The persecutor saved—I did behold; And with him Peter and James; apostles all Of Him who died to save their sinful souls from thrall. 23 They spake not of the kind of death they died: Not Paul of his beheading; nor if on The self-same day Peter was crucified Peter's crucifixion, with the head downwards, on the same day as Paul's martyrdom.—Eusebius, Jerome, Hegesippus, Chrysostom, Prudentius, etc., etc. Head downwards, in the spiritual Babylon; Nor of the sword wherewith the brother of John Was slain, by murderous Herod, heard I word Of boasting made by James. And when, anon, There met them James, the brother of the Lord, Surnamed “the Just,” he spake not of the old record, 24 How lawlessly the Pharisaic mob Hurled him sheer down from off the temple's wing And beat his brains out with a fuller's club, Death of James “the Just.”— Eusebius, Book II., c. I, and c. 23 Because full often they had felt the sting Of his reproofs amid their trafficking With vice in virtue's name. No thought of pride Did to the souls of the Apostles cling, While speaking of the Past. It seemed beside A stream of Paradise, in lowliness, they hied. 25 Most gratefully they spake of what they owed To their most loving Lord; and of the grace He gave them, while upon the earth they trode, His saving truth to welcome and embrace; And power to war with old affections base, Within; and strength and boldness to proclaim, Alike to Greek and Jew, in every place, The Gospel of God's Christ; and His high Name To enthrone where'er they bore the cross, despising shame. 26 And then they spake, in wonder, how such weak And faulty creatures as on earth they felt They were, God should have used His truth to speak And spread so widely through the realms where knelt Fallen men to brutish idols:—from the belt Of Libyan sand, and by the pillars named, Falsely, of Hercules, where the Iberian Kelt Worshipped the sun; and all around the famed Great Mediterranean Sea, 'mong nations haughtily claimed 27 For vassals by the imperial men of Rome,— To question-loving Athens, Corinth lewd— Of merchandise and wealth and sin become The heart of Greece, in her decrepitude;— And through the isles o'er the Ægean strewed; And in the stately cities of Levant, And Lesser Asia; till again were viewed The prostrate peoples who, with fire and chaunt, Knelt to the sun, in degradation jubilant! 28 And then they blessed the holy name of Christ, That now His truth across the seas was borne To men in late-found regions; and rejoiced That Gentile nations whom their sires with scorn Had looked upon, and treated as forlorn, Forsaken things of God, were filled with zeal For Christian truth. And then they 'gan to mourn, As happy spirits mourn in heaven, and feel For brethren who reject blindly their highest weal. 29 “Oh that our brethren who on earth still boast Of father Abraham's seed”—were the earnest cries Of holy Paul—“from grovelling in the dust Would cease, and strive to win the blessed prize Of life we share in Jesu's Paradise! When from their sight will they let fall the scales Of stubborn prejudice, and exercise The gift of patient thought, that never fails To find out truth, when earnestness in men prevails, 30 “And preference for the truth, whate'er betide Him that embraceth it? For God doth aid, Unknowing to the seeking soul, and guide Its search for truth. 'Twas thus displayed Was His large pity, although fierceness swayed My spirit, and I burned to shed the blood Of Jesu's saints. His holy eyes pervade Men's thoughts, marking their yearnings for the good, And leading them by ways they have not understood.” 31 “Yet, 'twas not patient thought, my brother Paul, I trow, that saved thee,” with fraternal smile Spake Peter; “rather say 'tis goodness all— Free, sovereign goodness—that doth choose the vile: The persecutor, thou—on murder bent, the while: The faithless, I, who did deny my Lord: 'Tis sovereign goodness that doth reconcile Fallen men to God.” “For ever be adored That goodness! Thou hast spoken the wiser and better word”— 32 The great apostle of the Gentiles said, With noble haste of meekness. “We must wait The Lord's good time. 'Twill surely come. The dead Shall rise to holy life. God will create Israel anew. His people's afterstate Of bliss on earth shall come. Men shall behold The day when every Jew shall hail God's great Messiah—Jesus the Nazarene—their old Rapt seers with joy beheld, and rapturously foretold.” 33 “Yet God,” said James, the martyr of that lewd And cruel king who gave the dancer vain John Baptist's head for fee, “still lets the feud Prevail 'tween Jew and Gentile. And the reign Of Christ on earth seems distant far. The strain Of triumph for the lowly Jesus swells Not yet, o'er land and sea. Old Error's chain Still binds half earth. The dark-skinned heathen sells His children to the white for gold. Earth's lands are hells 34 “Of evil yet, in spite of all God's strife With men, and Christ's dear suffering, and the zeal Of His dear saints. And yet may many a life Of Christian men be taken by the steel Of murderers vile who bear the outward seal And name of Christ. Or, men may have to burn, In scores, for Christ's own truth, till nations feel How bitter is the bondage they have worn Beneath the Man of Sin: that priest of pride and scorn!” 35 Thus, while they spake, came other spirits I knew, By mystic intellection, to belong To apostolic times: the holy Jew, Stephen, they stoned to death—that raving throng Whose clothes Paul held, believing right was wrong, And truth was falsehood! Now to him Paul cleaved; And Stephen grasped Paul's hand with fervour strong— Seeming to feel the highest triumph achieved For Christ, since even the persecutor fierce believed. 36 With Stephen came the martyr in old age, Brave Polycarp; Polycarp. For his martyrdom see the Circular Epistle of the Church of Smyrna, in Archbishop Wake's Epistles of the Apostolic Fathers. Also Eusebius,Book IV., c. 15. and he Justin Martyr, the Philosopher. See Eusebius, Book IV., c. 16. to Antonine Who wrote apologetic words, the sage Imperial moralist from fell design And murderous deed seeking by sooth to incline Towards tolerant regard for Christian men, But failed; and Simeon of the Saviour's line; Simeon, the relative of our Lord. For his martyrdom see also Eusebius, Book III., c. 32. And bold Ignatius, Ignatius. For the authorities respecting his martyrdom see Archbishop Wake's Epistles of the Apostolic Fathers.—of so lively ken, He looked as he would gladly face the lions agen! 37 “We spake, but now, of earth, and our own race,” Said James, the brother of the Lord, with look Of love fixed on the martyr Stephen's face; “Regard for Abraham's seed must be unshook Within us, even in heaven. Thou, in the book Divine, in mortal life, wert deeply skilled, Nor hath thy yearning soul desire forsook To know the fulness of the words that filled Thy heart with hope, yea, oft with joy thy bosom thrilled. 38 “Ages have rolled away since we of earth Ceased to be habitants; and Abraham's seed Still count God's great Messiah of no worth. They deem He earned the malefactor's meed— The scourge, the thorns, the cross, the spear; and feed Their mean imaginations with a king That shall be clothed with pomp and power, and lead The conquered heathen of their wealth to bring To his footstool a world-collected offering. 39 “Or, wise in grovelling doubt, but fools become Perforce of their own wisdom, they avow Their bold belief that wild delirium Impelled God's seers to utter words of woe Or rapture, and the kingdom to foreshew Of His Anointed One. No Christ—they say— There hath been, or there shall be. Of the Foe— The Antichrist—they swell the battle-array, Eager as their idolatrous sires for Falsehood's fray! 40 “Oh say, loved brother, who the holy seers, And their deep meaning, ponderest still, change not Thy cherished hopes for Israel into fears! Shall our own race to faith in Christ be brought By holy influences unknown, unsought, In their long stubbornness?”— “They shall return To heart-obedience; and then fully fraught With willingness to know, their souls shall learn The truth of Christ, and all their hearts with love shall burn 41 “To Him their erring fathers crucified!”— With holy haste, cried Paul; “blindness in part Hath happened unto Israel, till the tide Of Christian truth fill every Gentile heart; And then the Jew shall worship; and, athwart And thorough universal earth shall rise, Alike from polished Frank and Ethiop swart, The hymn of gladness that shall pierce the skies, And draw even angels down to list men's harmonies!” 42 The face of Paul glowed with a holy light; But Stephen's countenance with a brightness shone Transc endent as the sun above the night When earth is roofed with stars, as he made known How strong his confidence in God had grown, And God's great purpose to His prophets told, In ancient times, and o'er the record strown Of Holy Writ, in syllables of gold, That did to faithful minds their meaning bright unfold. 43 “To Zion shall the Redeemer come,” he sung; “And Jacob's late-born sons their sin shall leave; And God with fire of praise shall touch their tongue, When they at length His holy truth perceive. And they no more His Holy Spirit shall grieve, Nor shall their children, to the latest hour Men shall exist on earth. Israel shall cleave Unto the covenant-keeping God, their tower Of strength; and hallow His high Name for evermore! 44 “Zion shall rise and shine, and know her light Is come, and that the glory of the Lord Hath risen upon her darkness; and the sight Shall draw the grateful Gentiles toward God's house of glory that shall be restored On David's hill; and kings shall haste to own The King of kings, in David's city adored; And Midian, Ephah, and Sheba shall cast down The golden burthens of their camels before His throne. 45 “All Israel's sons shall gather from afar, And flow together first with fear—with joy, Full soon—for men from under every star The abundance of the sea shall bring, and cloy Jerusalem with good. It shall upbuoy The Gentile heart with gladness to join hand In hand with Abraham's sons, while all employ Their tongues to swell Christ's triumph, in one band Of holy brotherhood gathered from every land. 46 “I see, with eyes of faith, the flying cloud That, like a flock of doves, in joy return Unto their windows! I behold the crowd Of nations who our race beheld with scorn,— And long did contumeliously spurn And bruise,—now haste to bring the exiles home! Lo! Judah's children from their long sojourn Among the isles, in ships of Tarshish come!— How shall the ruined narrow city find them room? 47 “The sons of strangers shall her walls extend O'er neighbouring hills, and kings the work shall aid For now the days of God's just wrath shall end, And His sweet favour and mercy be displayed: Jerusalem in joy shall be arrayed; And through her gates, that shall continually Be open, day and night, the new Crusade— The host of love and peace—in holy glee Shall crowd, from every shore washed by the surging sea! 48 “Her, all the haughty kingdoms of the earth Shall serve, or perish. Even the fierce and high Who brought her sorrow, now shall bring her mirth: Yea, bending lowly, they shall come and lie Repentant at her feet. And all shall vie In zeal to pile with votive wealth the floor Of God's new sanctuary; for beautify His place on Zion He will again; no more To be cast down by proudest king or conqueror! 49 “Though once forsaken, and her name with hate Rehearsed, the Zion of the Holy One With plenty and with joy shall be elate. The Mighty One of Jacob shall make known That He, the Lord, Her Saviour, for His own Hath taken her; and men no more shall raise The cry of violence in her streets, or groan Of sorrow in her homes, through countless days: For they shall call her walls Salvation—her gates Praise. 50 “Her sun shall never more go down, or moon Withdraw its light. Her everlasting light The Lord Himself shall be: no clouded noon Of mourning she shall know, no cheerless night Of sorrow: Righteousness shall rule with bright And smiling sovereignty o'er all God's realm: The branch of His own planting, in His sight Shall flourish; and the weak the strong o'erwhelm; And glory sit on Israel's spiritual warrior helm! 51 “The Lord will hasten it, in His own time!”— He sang, with lips touched with a coal of fire From the same altar, the prophetic rhyme Of Him who struck with noblest hand the lyre Of all that God-inspired and matchless quire Who woke the echoes of each rocky dell Through Judah's land, what time the armies dire Of proud Assyria threatening came, but fell By the destroying angel's hand,—without a knell,— 52 Dead corpses all,—found in the early morn; And Sénnachérib fierce to Nineveh fled, And died by slaughterous hands of children born From his own loins:—while, as one from the dead New risen, meek Hezekiah raised his head, And he, and all Jerusalem, wondering, knew How soon from threats that fill the heart with dread God can deliver men—how soon subdue His people's foes, that murderously their souls pursue. 53 Isaiah's lofty song the martyr sang; And all sang with him, as they caught the strain; While as they sang, loud heavenly echoes rang Of elder songsters making sweet refrain. And, forthwith, these appeared—a stately train Of reverend forms—the minstrel leading them— Isaiah's self: he who was sawn in twain Isaiah. The account of his martyrdom is derived from a Rabbinical legend; but many commentators accept it, believing that it is referred to in Hebrews xi. 37. In his old age, by one the diadem Who stained, of Judah: impious fruit of pious stem: 54 Idolatrous Manasseh, who became A penitent in trouble, and made prayer To God, Who raised him from his prisoned shame, And set him on his throne again—the rare And precious fact in history to make fair For all men's gaze, through time—that kings may keep A promise made in trouble and despair,— Though, trouble past, they usually hold cheap Even oaths, and lightly law, most lawlessly, o'erleap. 55 The primal martyr, Abel, next I knew: The son whom our first mother wept to see Of life bereft; and whom his brother slew— Her first-born son. A martyr sure, was he— The first of men that died! By enmity Of sin to holiness the victim fell; And, through all years, bad men have raged to be Convicted of their ill by men who well Have lived; and sought, in blood, the hated good to quell. 56 The son of Barachiah, slain between The temple and the altar, “Zacharias, son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.”—Matt. xxiii. 35. eke, I saw,— With unnamed prophets whom the kings obscene Of Judah and Israel slew, to gorge the maw Of wickedness with righteous blood: God's law Despising, and His vengeance drawing down— At length—when that great prophecy with awe The twelve disciples heard their Lord make known Was full; and temple and altar were alike o'erthrown. 57 Last of the train came he who was the last Of God's high messengers that went before His Christ: he who proclaimed, as with the blast Of a shrill trumpet, on old Jordan's shore— “‘I am the voice of one foretold of yore— The herald crying in the wilderness— Prepare the way of the Lord!” Aspect he wore, Elijah-like, of courage questionless, That seemed his brethren with a sense of awe to impress. 58 And thus he spake: “With rapture, still on earth, Blest prophet, by believing men thy song Is sung; while unbelievers turn to mirth Thy bright foretellings, saying—Declare how long Shall Israel dwell in banishment, and wrong Receive from nations who Isaiah's God Adore—Isaiah's Christ with fervour strong Profess to love? When shall the heavens be bowed, And Christ descend on Olivet,—upon the cloud— 59 “They said they saw receive Him—the eleven Who gazed so steadfastly upon the bright Shekinah which upbore Him into heaven, His native seat,—while, by them, two in white,— The attendant angels,—pointed to the sight, Saying—This same Jesus shall again descend, Clothed in like manner with the cloud of light, As ye have seen Him go? When shall the end Of this world's kingdom be? Show us what signs portend 60 “The second coming of the Christ foretold By fablers, and by doting men believed? Where doth the wolf lie down within the fold With the young lamb, in peace? Who hath perceived The cow, no longer of her calf bereaved By the grim bear, feed with him, while their young Lie down together? What child hath achieved The fearless feat to dare the forky tongue O' the cockatrice, and play upon its den unstung? 61 “We see no signs that your famed Prince of Peace Shall come, and o'er the happy nations reign. The wolf—the Christian shepherd—yet doth fleece The sheep; the royal lion and leopard drain The life's blood of the labouring ox: in vain We look for serpents that with children play, And harm them not: knaves still the simple swain Entrap and rob. Thus, ages pass away— Christ will come, why doth He thus delay? 62 “So, in old time, the Pharisee and scribe, Who listened to the Saviour's warning word, Denied His truth, with scoff, and jeer, and gibe, And, voluntarily blind, His claims ignored. But, on their children was the vengeance poured That Christ foretold. And yet will God, blest seer! Thy prophecies fulfil. Again the Lord Will come in judgment; but will first appear In mercy. They who wait for Him discern Him near!” 63 Although in Paradise, the son of Eve, With looks and words of mingled sorrow and love, Began: “The first of martyred men must grieve For memory of that brother who first strove Against his brother. For the curse hath clove— The curse of murder—to our sinful race, Since first the spirit of evil did Cain move To shed his brother's blood: no resting-place The wanderer found: he ever saw the fancied face 64 “Of the avenger. And the murderer still Doth tremble at the sound o' the fallen leaf— And yet men murder! —yet, with rebel will, Men wander from all good, and spend their brief Sojourn on earth in filling it with grief! I would the day were come, O Prophet sweet, When how to bless each other shall be chief Of men's desires and thoughts—when men shall greet Each other with true loving hearts where'er they meet! 65 “I would thy glorious vision of the joy And love and peace that men on earth shall feel, — The works of love and peace that shall employ Their hearts and hands, —the Present would reveal. The Past hath wounds that no regrets can heal; And, in the Future, until earth become A world of loving men who for the weal Of others toil unselfishly, —its gloom Brings sorrow to my soul, even in this blissful home! 66 “Bear with me lovingly, dear saints of God! Ye scarce can feel as I feel. When I came A stranger here, where none but angels trod This Paradise of blessedness; —where name Of Man itself was new; —not without shame And awe I witnessed how, with piercing eyes, The angels wondered, when from fiery flame And axe, and other deaths of hideous guise, Truth's victims crowded hither, slain by Men of Lies! 67 “And, through the long, long ages, still arrives The host of martyred men from earth. The hate— The deadly hate—of evil men survives For good men—oh, how long! I watch and wait, But see not that their rage for murder doth abate. O Lord, how long—” “O gentle son of Eve!” Isaiah gently spake: “doth not the Great, The High and Lofty One wait also? Grieve His essential Love it must—doth not thy soul believe— 68 “That still His saints fall victims to the rage Of murderous brothers who are mad with sin? — Could He not end them? —or, their wrath assuage? But why, or wherefore, did their being begin? God is all-wise: His work is not akin To man's: abortive oft. And, if away God took man's freedom, none reward could win Who served God; and man's worship would convey No praise unto God's ear, though it should last for aye. 69 “Thy gentle soul, O Abel, doth with love— With pitying love—for suffering man, run o'er. But, doth not God's forbearance larger prove His love and pity—since He wields His power, Not to crush sinners; but, His grace to shower Upon their hearts, to soften them, and bring Their wills towards good: although the noble dower Of freedom that He gave, He will not wring From man or angel: His own work disparaging. 70 “We may not wish that the All-wise had laid The vast foundations of His universe According to our wisdom; or had made Intelligent creatures whom He did coerce To keep His law, whom sin could not amerce With suffering. What our Holy God hath done Is done in goodness, as in wisdom. 'Sperse Thy sorrow with the thought, O gentle one! O' the joys of men and angels since their being begun.” 71 “I do adore His wisdom, and confess His goodness infinite,” meekly replied The son of Eve; ”my thought is languageless When I would sum the good that is allied Even with suffering. Yet again the tide Of grief will swell, amid the joys of heaven, When I bethink me how the earth is dyed With blood of God's dear saints. From it long riven, To lingering love of its old home the soul is given.” 72 “Sweet patriarchal spirit, and brethren dear! I speak with diffidence, where elders tell Their thoughts”—said Justin, the philosopher— “Thoughts of deep mysteries that often dwell In human hearts untold, until they swell To bursting: for, men bind each other down With chains that cause the spirit to rebel— Forbidding men to think—until men moan, And wish they never had the gift of thinking known. 73 “We ever deemed it past man's finding out Why God had made a universe where death And sin and suffering could be found—a doubt To render possible, or peril faith That God is what the holy volume saith He is—the High and Lofty One, the True And Holy and Good and Loving One, that hath Been ever, and that ever shall be. But the clue Of subtler, simpler thought we reach in this the new 74 “And sinless habitation of the soul— Wherein her powers are strengthened, and her gaze Is purged from fleshly films. God hath made all— We now discern, surrounded with the blaze Of His perfections—purposely to raise Within His creatures perfect loving trust In His unselfishness. In all their ways Of lauding Him, the children of the dust Fall short—unnaming that great attribute august! 75 “It had been selfishness had He but made A lifeless universe—however wise Its mechanism and motions had displayed His mind to be—or beauty of the guise Of things, Him beautiful that did devise Their forms and hues, had proven. But one Mind— His own—the Awful One's—to know or prize The wisdom and the beauty! How unkind Were such Creator in His awfulness enshrined! 76 “To store His glorious universe with life God's blest unselfishness His essence moved; And thus all worlds with living things are rife. But, gift of life alone had not Him proved Unselfish. Living things it Him behoved To bless—to make them worthy of His hand. For, if no creature could have known or loved, Have thought or felt—as well a barren strand, Or lifeless ocean, God eternally had planned! 77 “God were not blest could He not love and feel As well as know. Vain sages of the East Affirm their Brahm, the highest, hath perfect weal Because he is emotionless—divest Of feeling—joy or grief; and in such rest— Such blank quiescence—centres perfect bliss! But God's word leaves us to no barren quest About Himself—no cold hypothesis: It tells us that He hates the sinner's ways amiss, 78 “But loves the righteous; that He hath great joy When sinners turn and leave their sinful way, And seek their Father's house; but that the alloy Of grief is His when His own people stray From His sweet service. If unwise men say— Can, then, the Unchangeable rejoice or grieve, And still be perfect? Yea, we answer, yea: Unchangeable holiness, His saints believe, Is His; and higher perfectness none can conceive. 79 “God's happiness is perfect, not because He is almighty, or all-wise, or fills Infinity, or gives all life by laws Himself supports. But perfect happiness thrills His holy essence, since He ever wills And does that which is holy, perfectly. Just ire, grief, love—emotions—are not ills To perfect holiness. No change shall be In God's all-perfect bliss throughout eternity. 80 “And from eternity hath been no change In His all-perfect bliss, though He hath seen Men's wickedness, and grieved. Grief was not strange To God's omniscience. His creation teen, He knew, must bring to Him, amid the sheen Of His all-glorious perfectness—for free If His creation were, though strong, or keen In intellect, yet they must ever be Subject to imperfection, as He did foresee, — 81 “And though foreseeing, chose to make them free, And chose to grieve and suffer, that He might Have creatures in His universe to be Recipients of His bounty, and delight Might take in blessing them, and oft requite With tenderness their base ingratitude, And follow them in their wanderings from the right— Leaving it hard for sinful ears to exclude His call of love with which He hath their souls pursued.” 82 He ceased; not as if all his thoughtful theme Were uttered, but himself with measurement Meting of lowliness: nor with esteem And reverence for God's elder saints unblent Seemed his demeanour. Praise, awhile, upsent The Martyr-host, in silence, with devout Rapt feeling: silence deep: more eloquent Than words—for through each visage beamed the thought Of grateful love with which their wondering souls were fraught. 83 “Thy words are sooth, my brother,” holy Paul Thus earnestly the silence broke:“for Love Alone is pure Unselfishness; and all Our best conceptions, when on earth we strove To express God's nature, did but feeble prove Compared with that one sentence of His word— That God is Love. The proof is brightly wove In every sentence of that vast record The archangels keep of all they know the Sovran Lord 84 “Hath done, since they primeval light first saw; And, unto man, the proof is best revealed In God's best gift of His dear Son, from woe To save our sinful race. How oft this field Of thought we visit! —and it still doth yield Fresh riches, and will ever; for, again And oft, this theme will charm us, till unsealed Is every prophecy, and Christ's great reign Makes unto men and angels God's great meaning plain!” 85 A hand of golden light appeared aloft! The signal seemed to all familiar, for Upward all glanced, and then around with soft Benignant smile upon each other: store Of love congratulant within the core Of every heart fraternal beaming bright Upon their faces, while they left the shore Of that sweet stream with flowers so richly dight I dreamt I saw, at first, with new-born spiritual sight. 86 Obedient to the sign, with lively pace They trod the plain, till they the hills could climb, And spoke with rapture of the errands of grace From which they had returned, in lands of crime And error that they once, in olden time, Had known and loved. The martyred prophets said Old Jordan's banks were fair as in their prime, But o'er the land the stones of ruin spread Scarce shewed what glories had belonged unto the dead. 87 And when sweet Olivet, and their loved lake, Gennesaret, the Apostles saw, they told How burnt within their hearts the words He spake To them—the Lowly One—in days of old, As if they heard His voice, and did behold His meek form still. And then Jerusalem They named with words that shewed above all gold They priced her dust, and thought her still the gem Of all the earth, though shorn of her old diadem. 88 But Polycarp spake sadly:“Light hath waned In Smyrna and our Asian churches, where It once burned purely. Long hath Falsehood reigned, Boasting her crescent, in those regions fair. And, though a few are found not loath to share Christ's shame, or own His cross, —dark errors blind Them till their good and ill seem but to bear A semblance to the grace and beauty shrined In marbled ruin, which upon that shore men find.” 89 “And Antioch—the beautiful—the great!” Said bold Ignatius, “where our faith first found A name—what marks her now? How desolate And silent are the spaces where the ground Oft shook with feet of crowds—the air with sound Of festive shouts was filled”— “Yet, within cell Monastic, in those lands,” said Simeon, “bound With fetters of the soul, although men dwell, Sometimes they burst their bondage, we can gladly tell. 90 “Bethink ye both, my brethren, of the poor Weak trembler with old age we lately hied To comfort, at behest Divine, and found the lore Of Christ his soul had sweetly learned, and tried To enlighten others. And he joyous died, For some had listened to his words with joy, And learnt to love, in truth, the Crucified. — O let the bliss we reap from such employ, Revisiting old earth, all sad regrets destroy!” 91 But now to climb the mountains ever green Began the Martyrs. All, with one consent, Well-ordered step and timely march were seen To keep, with bands that up before them went, Or followed after; and right soon were blent The myriad voices of the Martyr-throng In choral triumph. Voice mellifluent One raised, at call of them who did belong Unto the Martyr-host: thus Stephen led the song: 92 “Glory to Thee, the covenant-keeping God! Who didst our fathers in Thy goodness lead Back to Thy way, when oft they wandering trod The path of error, yea, pursued with greed The rebel road, although for holy seed Thou hadst them chosen; and didst from ruin save Them oft, and them with heavenly manna feed, — Yea, didst for their deliverance cleave the wave In which their foes, o'erwhelmed, soon found a watery grave! 93 “O Holy One of Israel! hear the cry Our longing hearts now send up to Thine ear! Our race—the race of Abraham—soon bring nigh To own Thy great Messiah, from their drear And cheerless unbelief! O Lord, bring near Our brethren, whom to love we cannot cease— Feeling Thy love, and knowing they are dear Unto Thine heart, and that it will increase The bliss of saints to see the wanderers seek Thy peace 94 “Lord! bring the wanderers back! Remove the veil From off the heart of Israel! Lord, make bare Thy holy arm of might! They cannot fail— Thy holy promises: Thou didst declare The race of Abraham should for ever share Thy smile; and Thou wilt yet their hearts dispose To love Thee. Hasten, Lord, the time! The prayer Of all Thy grateful saints regard: disclose The morn when rays of love shall subdue all Thy foes!” 95 The song went on—the song of love and praise, And prayer, and zeal for others' bliss. But now The inward beckoning came that their glad lays, For me, must end: unto the mountains' brow I mote not climb; but on the earth below Must longer toil. I woke, with thankful mind That God had given me pleasant life to know On earth: a life He stores with bounties kind, And heartfelt joy that dreary doubt is left behind. BOOK THE THIRD. 1 I look, once more, upon the awful sea! I may not sing of it as lordly Childe— Albeit with heart-throes—sang exultantly, As of a steed that under its exiled And haughty rider bounded with a wild Feeling of kindred scorn and pride. His fame Was glorious in my boyhood; but 'tis soiled, They tell me, now. Oh, can it be that shame Shall his bright memory hide who bears that laurelled name! 2 I gaze, once more, upon the awful sea— Not with exultant, but with wondering thought, And humbled feeling. 'Midst eternity And boundlessness yon tiny white-sailed yacht, In the far-off horizon, seems to float! The wide-spread, silent moor, the tallest hills, Breed no such thinking in me, awe, and doubt, As this strange sense, all-undefined, that thrills My bosom while the measureless sea my vision fills. 3 What is Existence?—what Eternity? What lies beyond our outer life? Thy waves, For ever restless, change—O Living Sea! — And our own breathing forms, —the dead, in graves, — Change, ever! Thy vast waters, —whether raves The tempest, or the weary winds find sleep, As poets sing, within thy neighbouring caves, — The pulse of language with their motion keep, And seem, like us, to shout and whisper, laugh and weep! 4 Thy waters are not dead. They truly live: More truly than the forms that in thee dwell. These die; but thou dost still live on, and give Thy outspread hands, when thy proud billows swell, Unto the toiling sun, that ye may quell Death's triumphs ever, and all Life renew. Your progeny, the clouds and showers, dispel Earth's barrenness. And thus, all Life seems due, On earth—O glorious ministers of God! —to you. 5 Many-voiced Sea—as the melodious One, Wondering, did name thee, in the days of old— It is a luxury, 'neath the summer's sun, To loiter on this Cumbrian shore, and hold Communion with thy voices manifold. Scarce louder than the murmuring bee the sound Seems, now I sit upon this beech sweet-knolled With thyme, and where the rock-rose doth abound, And crimson cranesbills clothe with beauty the rough ground. 6 And now the air doth tremble 'neath high noon, And Languor reigns, how, with thy simple lay, — Which hath to me from boyhood, been a boon, And purest joys brings back to mind, alway, — Thou, darling yellow-hammer, seem'st to play A witching treble to the waters' bass, — While other birds are silent: even the gay And tireless lark seeks now a resting-place, And hides, beside his mate, among the tall ripe grass. 7 Sweet thoughts of pleasures past, thy soothing lull, O Sea, calls up to memory; but thy shore, To-morrow, may be strown with mast and hull Of many a goodly ship, and mind me more Of my own wrecks of purpose, and the poor Fruition of endeavour to achieve Great aims. 'Tis vain such failures to deplore, Now I am near life's close; but still will grieve The soul, though 'tis too late life's failures to retrieve. 8 Shall I behold thy waves when I have sailed O'er this life's sea? I shall live on, when Death Hath claimed my clay—his portion. But all-veiled Is still the Future—the Eternal. Breath And pulse I cannot have when its frail sheath The spirit quits; but yet the soul may gaze Upon thy restless waves, as oft she fleeth To do God's high behests, —and, without daze, May, look, O glorious Sun, upon thy gladdening blaze. 9 Shall after-life be indolence? Each thing Living on earth, whether it will or nill, The eternal purpose of the Eternal King Doth most industriously and well fulfil, Through every change—as thou dost, changing still, Vast Sea, and still subserving in thy change The ends of Him who holds thee by His will. Surely, if franchised souls to some dull range Were doomed, to God's known ways it were unlikeness strange! 10 Boundless as thy path seems to be, shall mine Be, in the Future? Yet, how shrinks the soul At thoughts of boundlessness! What! no confine— No shore—but on, for ever;—and no goal— No end! Space still beginning, and the roll Of days grown dateless, numberless! And shall This Self, that—like a prisoner on parole, When It adventures forth to think, a thrall Soon feels Itself, and hastens back to its poor cloisteral, 11 Dim-lighted home of flesh, affrighted at The shapes of mystery It meets—soon quit the gloom And glimmer of this earth, and try a state Of veritable existence, in the womb Of vastness all-illimitable, become An unclothed spirit, and yet clothed upon With immortality, fearless to roam Through realms of life and realms of thought unknown, — And still, for ever, feel Its journey scarce begun? 12 The soul within her prison-house of clay Shrinks back at thought of such strange life unknown, As if too perilous it were too stray Through the wide universe of God alone— Or, unconsorted, in some planet-zone That girdles round some far-off solar fire, With essences that large of ken have grown, By myriad years of thought, yet never tire To think and search; but ever pant for wisdom higher. 13 Alone, upon the pathless sea, rides yet The tiny white-sailed yacht. Since height Of noon no bark, no shallop, or corvette, No humble fisher's boat, hath come in sight: Still lonelily she floats, with sails so white— Far off—so that no help could landsmen lend, Were skies to change, and storms to come, with night. But, God is there! No storm the ship can rend, Unless, —His mandate given! —His ministers descend. 14 So God will be with my frail bark, and thine, Frail brother, when the unknown seas we sail Of unknown after-life. The Eye Divine Is on us here, in earthly calm or gale; And on each soul that lives beyond the veil Unrent—each dweller in eternity; The Hand Divine supports alike all frail Existences in heaven and earth that be— For frail were even the archangels, Sovran, without Thee! 15 Why should I shrink and fear, while I can lean On the Eternal One? Yet, how I dread The “inevitable hour”! Some, with serene Indifference, of the grave as of a bed Of rest, tell us, they dream—nay, they would wed Annihilation gladly; while the best And holiest I have known on earth have said They had no fear, but longed to reach the rest That for the people of God remaineth, with the Blest. 16 With a glad heart I tell—the phantom foul That threatened Nothingness, to terrify And fill with agony my doubting soul Hath ceased. But still—What can it be to die? That thought appals me. Though with strengthened eye I look triumphantly beyond the grave, And feel my trustful spirit can rely On Him who strong, for ever, is to save— Yet, on Death's self I cannot look with challenge brave.— 17 The filmy cloud I saw arise, but now, Hath spread along the sky—a dark portent That storm is near. So some slight signal, slow Or swift, may warn me when my soul now blent With flesh must leave it. May Death's storm be spent Quickly, O Blessed Father! if Thy will It be, —or, rather, let the veil be rent All in a moment, while I seek to fill My daily task, —that so I, with ecstatic thrill, 18 May pass from mortal to immortal life. Nay! —let me breathe no prayer so full of fear And selfishness! Up, to the battle's strife, Once more! until the Master's voice shall cheer Me, when—the mortal victory won—I hear Him say, “Well done, thou good and faithful one, Enter into my joy, my servant dear!” — Lord, let me fight until the battle's done— Nor ever wish for rest until the battle's won! 19 My nightly task—the task of Duty—claims, Again, my heart and mind; a task now hard— Nay, harder than he knows, who 'mid fierce flames Moulds melted metal; or, with body marred And crampt-up limbs, from sun and daylight barred, Hews at the coal-seam; or, whose mighty blows Ring loud upon the anvil. Small regard The peasant lends me! “Why for him unclose The bar to knowledge? want of it he hardly knows; 20 “And why disturb him?” —do ye ask, in scorn, Or kindly? —“Leave him to his vulgar toil And vulgar pleasures. Teach him not to spurn The lot of ignorance, and seek the broil Of thought, lest he encounter the dread foil To deeper thought all thinkers surely find.” I dare not join a project that would spoil My brother-man, whom God hath given a mind That may be nobly taught, and cultured, and refined. 21 It cannot be God's purpose that the soul He meant to live for ever should be left Untaught, and Man become a larger mole To burrow in the earth, of light bereft, Or crawl upon it like the reptile eft, Unknowing of his heavenly destiny. They practised on Man's freedom a fell theft Who praised blind Ignorance, and said that she Was Mother of Devotion. Set Man fully free— 22 Free from the bonds of ignorance and control Of priests—free from the shackles of his pride And low self-worship. Let him know the whole Of Truth that hath been found, and do not hide The fact that more Man knows not. He will chide Himself, most healthfully, and gladly flee From error, when himself thus dignified He fully feels with his own sovereignty Of soul, as freeborn Man. O set Man fully free! 23 And yet, though Knowledge be a precious boon For Man, he who the task doth undertake To teach men how to think, no mean poltroon Must be in courage; nor, in weakness quake At proud men's anger; nor, his task forsake For others' coldness or dull sloth. To say And do as others, nor with boldness break From tyrant custom, or the gilded way Of fashion, marks the million: only units stray 24 In paths of independence, and assert Their native dignity of Man. And sloth Seems rest so needful to poor men upgirt For out-door labour through the day, it doth Give pain to one, more than their ways uncouth, To rouse them with hard messages of right And wrong. How, if they sleep, can one be wroth? In sooth, he ventures on a work of might Who strives to keep a weary ploughman wake at night. — 25 My task is done once more: the hour hath passed More pleasantly than I foreboded. Yet, What drudgery 'tis to talk to looks aghast With helpless wonder; or that seem to fret With haste to leave you; or to figures set As stark asleep as if nought but the loud Last trump could consciousness in them beget; While others glance around with spirit cowed, As if they felt like leprous men among the proud! 26 How different were my labour amid shrewd Auld Scotland; or th' West Riding, where our keen Critics-in-fustian sit and inly brood; Or, where Northumbrian miners with brave mien Of kindly frankness earnestly upglean Your thoughts; or, with the quick discerning throng In noble Nottingham; or, my native scene Of ancient Leicester; or, much more, among Bold Birmingham's array of thinkers stern and strong; 27 Or, sceptical Northampton, where the knights Of Crispin ply the awl, and challenge high Hurl at old teachers—following all new lights! Or, grand old Norwich; or, in Bristol, eye Of England's west, where good men truly vie One with another in truly Christian deed; Or even 'mid London's shallow foppish fry,— One might with Truth the mind more easily feed Than get dull peasants to such teaching to take heed. 28 Poor English ploughmen! my very heart doth bleed For you. Your little children I have passed, Driven forth in “gangs,” to gather stones, or weed, When scarcely it was daylight, o'er the vast Wide fen of Lincolnshire, —their eyes upcast For pity at their driver—the brute tool Who pushed them on with curses; and “move fast,” They must, or suffer his hard blows. No school For the poor ploughman's child! He would be called a fool 29 By his own class, and proud by masters, who Let his child learn to read God's word instead Of toiling early and late, —and learning, too, To swear like the big driver, —and lose dread For foulest vice, where all restraints are fled, And sex is rudely mixt. The boy or girl Brings home a few poor pence each day for bread: What's all the learning that his head might whirl With pride, compared with bread, to the poor peasant churl? 30 Oh, gentlemen of England! in your House Of power and wisdom, can ye find no heart To end this wrong so horribly infamous? Ye could set free the Factory child, and thwart The chimney-sweeper, who made infants smart And weep for years; and ye could boldly vote Twenty gold millions to break up the mart Of demons who the souls and bodies bought Of negroes: —Why not seize this evil by the throat? 31 Landlords! upon your land this deed is done. Doth not the tenant know your word is law? Forbid the deed, then: tell him he must shun The sin, and ye will cease the gain to claw, And lower his rent. —“Idiot! expect to draw Our teeth, as soon; or, ask to flay the skin From off our backs! We do not yield one straw!” — Why, then, right honourables! your sordid sin I would not share, if your whole rent—roll I could win. 32 The hour of sleep returns, and still I weigh The sins of other men. Upon my own Black catalogue, with the like keen survey, I fear, I do not dwell. Lord, from Thy throne Look down in mercy still on those who groan O'er others' sins, and oft forget to judge Their own! When waking consciousness had flown, My dreaming consciousness returned. A drudge, I seemed, at first, among old earthly scenes to trudge. 33 O'er Croyland Fen, methought, in evening gray, I toiled, from rural Helpstone, —where poor Clare Was born, —along the narrow winding way The monks upraised, in dark old times, with care And patient labour. 'Twas the desolate and rare Vision renewed, of forty years gone by, When—myriad ages past—no rude ploughshare Had yet disturbed the marsh. Far as the eye Could reach there was no tree that grew beneath the sky. 34 A clump of reeds rose, here and there, around A pool; and, ghostlike, up the bittern reared Its head out of the clump, and then to the ground Sank down, and hid itself, and boomed its weird And shivering note. But, what most strange appeared Was that vast moving host of feathered things— The countless flocks of geese, that homeward steered, With deafening cackle, and with bleeding wings Drooped to the ground, while,—heedless of their sufferings,— 35 The gooselike gosherd urged them with his staff. The geese had just been plucked alive,—their quill To exchange for gold. The gosherds, with a laugh, Told me they helped the deed. But I felt ill, And hastened on, while overhead the shrill Curlew, the lapwing, and the heron, flew; And, far up in the sky, the soaring, still, And lordly glede seemed taking surer view Ere pouncing, dartlike, down, his screaming prey he slew. 36 I went—the pilgrim of romance—to gaze On Guthlac's ruined shrine—the hoary pile Of Croyland; and the image that pourtrays King Ethelbald the Mercian, broken and vile, On that triangular bridge that joined the isle So sacred to profaner ground, in years When monks held marish and mere for many a mile. Darkness was falling as I gazed; and jeers From ploughboys that beheld me pained my ticklish ears. 37 So on I passed, to shun the boyish crowd; But soon, from weariness, lay down to rest Upon a grassy hillock, o'er which bowed A bush in which some late bird kept her nest. And, as she crooled, I slept. Among the Blest— From sleep within my sleep—again, I seemed To wake surrounded with the host all drest In light. But they whom now I saw—I dreamed— Were souls I had in mortal life but lightly esteemed. 38 Stern devotees of mediæval time They were: brave venturers among savage tribes; Daring reprovers, eke, of kingly crime And priestly sloth; —who heeded not the gibes Of their own order; —nor concealed, for bribes, The sins of monarchs whose haught pomp affrayed Their trembling subjects; —or whom timid scribes Writ “holy,” for they stalked in masquerade Of cowl and hood, begirt with rope, in cloistered shade. 39 He whom men call the Apostle of Germany, I saw—Winfred of Crediton Winfred of Crediton in Devonshire (in the kingdom of Wessex), born in 680 A.D.—He was consecrated Bishop, and named Boniface by Pope Gregory II., in 723 A.D. His life was written by Willibald, one of his disciples.—See “Life of St. Boniface, Archbishop of Mayence and Apostle of Germany.” By the Rev. Geo. W. Cox, S.C.L. London, Joseph Masters: 1853.—our Saxon saint, Named Boniface, when episcopal degree Was given him by the pope. In him no taint Of Romish crime was found, natheless. Restraint Or fear he felt not for tiara or crown; But, like a Christian true, set forth his plaint 'Gainst papal simony; and dared to frown Upon the heathenish sins 'mong prelates shown. 40 While he hewed down the sacred oak of Thor, And preached to Hessian and to Frisian throngs Of barbarous men, and taught them to abhor Idols and wizards and blood, and sing the songs Of Christ, the Prince of Peace,—sin that belongs So often to magnanimous kings he dared To scan: to Mercian Ethelbald the wrongs Done to his people wisely he declared, Until that regal heart to goodness he ensnared. 41 With Winfred walked his brethren who, of yore, Were massacred, or slain, by heathen bands— Eoban, and Adalhere, —There were others martyred in Friesland besides Boniface and these two.—For their names, see Cox's “Life of St. Boniface,” p. 129. and many more— Meek, self—denying men—men of clean hands, And minds devout—obeying Christ's commands From love to Him who first loved them, and spread O'er Frisic, Hessian, and Bavarian lands The gospel of their Lord: giving the bread Of life to perishing men: by no false zeal misled. 42 Remembering how, on earth, I lightly esteemed The work of these stern toilers, whom I now Rightly, by mystic gift of insight, deemed True martyrs—I beheld, with sudden glow Of pleasure, drawing near, in goodly row, A band whom others lightly esteemed, on earth— Lightly esteemed, and scorned, and trampled low; But whose meek names I valued at right worth, And oft felt pround I had with them one tie of birth. 43 Many of these meek ones died through men whose boast— Oh, of such grievous sin, I blush to tell! — Was rather than that liberty be lost Of conscience for themselves they would rebel Till doomsday: yet, like fiercest dogs of hell, They worried men whose consciences felt fear Of sin most tenderly; and tortures fell Of whipping, hunger, and imprisonment drear, And filthy, and foul, inflicted on God's servants dear. 44 Some of Old England were, and some of New. Some were the victims of our boasted time When kingly men in England overthrew Crowned lawlessness and sanctimonious crime; And some died when returned the kingly Mime To reign and sin right royally. The rest Were martyred men and women from that clime Across the sea where, in the distant West, Their persecutors found a refuge they deemed blest. 45 Parnell, James Parnell.—For the cruel martyrdom of this dear young Quaker lad, at Colchester Castle, in 1655—during the Protectorate of Cromwell—see Sewell's “History of the Rise, Increase, and Progress of the Christian People called Quakers.” I saw, the godly boy that death Of heartless cruelty who died, i' the wall Of Colchester's strong castle—with last breath Entreating they would let the happy thrall Go home to Christ!

And others, who in Newgate drank the gall Of wrong so meekly; and Trowell, John Trowell.—He was so beaten and brusied and crushed by the Trained Bands of King Charles II., who were sent to break up Quaker's meetings by force, that he died.—See the beginning of the 7th Book of Sewell's History. who was torn And bruised and beaten, till he ceased on earth to mourn. 46 Howgill Francis Howgill. —He died in Appleby gaol, after five years imprisonment.

Good Mary Dyar, —Of all the New England Martyrs, this heroic and holy woman seems to have been the flower. Her death—after prolonged ill-treatment and suffering—was joyous and exultant.—See the 5th Book of Sewell's History. who climbed with fortitude The gallows' ladder twice. In mockery lewd Called down the first time: soon with joy she clomb Again, to die—saying, sweetly, that she viewed The Paradise of Christ, beyond the tomb, Where she had been, in spirit, for days: her heavenly home! 48 Next, with unlyric names, —William Robinson a merchant of London, and Marmaduke Stevenson of Yorkshire, were condemned to be hanged along with Mary Dyar. The three went hand in hand, exultantly, to the gallows. Robinson and Stevenson being dead, Mary Dyar was ordered to ascend the ladder, which she did readily; but when they had tied her hands and bandaged her eyes, they told her she was reprieved. Yet she was executed some months after. The bodies of Robinson and Stevenson having hung till they were dead. they were cut down, and thrust naked into a hole dug for them at the foot of the gallows. —See Sewell's 5th Book.joined hand in hand, Fraternally, came on the faithful sufferers twain Whose naked flesh, as if they bore the brand Of felony, or shared the crime of Cain, Was thrust into the ground, with foul disdain, Even at the gallows' foot. Then, Leddra, William Leddra. —He was chained to a log, both day and night, during a long winter, and in an open prison. He died with the calmest resignation. —See Sewell's 6th Book. bright Hilarious soul, followed—who met death's pain Crying, “Lord, receive my spirit!” —seeming God's light To see, with dying eyes: blest Stephen's martyr-sight! 49 The souls of women, young and old, whom fiends That dared to claim the name of Christian men Whipped through New England towns —The barbarous whipping of Elizabeth Hooton, a woman of threescore years of age, of Anne Colman, of Mary Tomkins, of Alice Ambrose, and others, is recited also by Sewell in his 6th Book.—for they were “Friends,” — A deadly crime! —arrived with these. And when These unadorned new-comers met the ken O' the Martyrs to the blinded Pagan rage Of mediæval times, in a green glen Of Paradise, amazed, I saw them wage A race of love to join—as if their lineage 50 They knew was one; and though so far apart, In time and place, they lived on earth, they felt Their zeal for Christ proclaimed them of one heart. “Brothers,” spake Winfred, “when on earth we dwelt, And preached to savage Teuton and fierce Kelt, It scarce was strange that, blind with idol-zeal And gust for sin, —even while to Christ we knelt, — They slew us, thinking then to rob and peel Our tents of gold and silver we could not reveal 51 “As in our keeping, since no needless load We carried, cumbered and bowed too much with sin. But who your deaths and sufferings could forebode— Your torturous martyrdoms—from your own kin, Your own dear flesh and blood? Nay, that within The bounds of likelihood might be; but they Who took your lives professed high discipline Of self-denial, and could not seek to slay Ye that your gold and silver might become their prey 52 “What was the gain they sought? what earthly good Could they acquire in slaying ye? No hoard Of wealth ye had, that they should shed your blood To seize it and possess.” “Be Christ adored,” Spake noble Howgill, “though their deed abhorred We may not, by the nature of the mind, Forget, we still feel loving pity toward The men whom bigotry had rendered blind— Nay, mad—as still it maddens thousands of mankind. 53 “Dost thou not think, my brother, that as brave Martyrs for wrong are sometimes found, as for The right? I doubt not but that some who drave, Fiercely, our feeble ones with whipping sore, From town to town, believed they did no more Than bounden duty; and if called to bear Smiting, the rod to death they would have bore Sooner than name of foul apostate wear, Or gold and silver as the apostate's guerdon share. 54 “It was not earthly gain our foes obtained, Or sought. Our deaths could not enrich our foes In any sordid sense. But still remained In them the carnal mind that doth oppose Itself to goodness. Though by outward shows And loud profession, men do oft persuade Themselves and others that within them glows True Christian zeal, the proof is soon betrayed That not one moment its pure fires their hearts pervade. 55 “How eagerly men praise great earnestness, Though earnest men are caught by falsehood's bait So easily! Surely men should laud much less Quick zeal than slower wisdom. They who wait, Patient, at Wisdom's feet, regenerate Become in spirit, and feel no tyrant will To fetter the free mind—to emasculate The soul. Their victories they win meekly, still Not seeking to compel, but to persuade the ill: 56 “To win men over by conviction, clear And calm, that so the settled mind in ease May rest, and satisfaction. Kings no fear Have of their subjects if their reigning please. But though meek men may bear kings' wrong decrees, Their hearts will aye the sceptred wrong disown. Force never truly reigns: its falseness frees All men from heart-obedience to the throne: For force is falseness, even to the simplest clown.” 57 “Ay, force is falseness,” said our Saxon saint; “And neither force nor falseness masterdom Can win for Truth. With us failed false constraint, When, backed with fancied power from Papal Rome, We forced the Teuton nations to succumb To Christ. In vain we triumphed, as the oak Of Thor I hewed in pieces. Awe held dumb Thor's worshippers to witness the bold stroke; But soon their awe was gone—revenge within them woke, 58 “And back to their old homage at the shrine Of their old Thunder God they went with zeal, While on ourselves they fell with leonine And bloody rage. God did, at length, His seal Set to His truth, when wiser men the appeal Made to their moral sense-the meek yet broad Attack on conscience-which will straight reveal Its living power in man, though long by fraud It hath been lulled to slumber, or by force o'erawed. 59 “I would more wisdom had our earnest toil Directed. Savage men, like children, might, We thought, be held by fear or kindly guile, And taught to fall in reverence at the sight Of saintly bones or gaudy incensed rite, As they had fallen before the Sun and Moon, And Thor and Woden. Oh, that holy light Upon our eager minds had clearer shone, That their dark souls for Christ we might in love have won!” 60 “Ye worked according to your light. And they By their light—twilight, rather,”meekly said Young Parnell, “now are judged, by Him whose sway Knows neither weakness nor injustice. Dread In holiness are His commands: to tread His courts in heaven, unfit they were: the praise Of God and of the Lamb who for them bled They could not sing: but just are all His ways: Only transgressors of His law its sentence slays. 61 “None can transgress the law they never knew; Therefore, the millions of the heathen live Their after-life of trial, where the view Of truth and right and wrong God doth them give In clearness, and His Spirit doth with them strive, That they may yield their wills to Him, and share Salvation by His Christ. Alternative Of choice they still to exercise may dare. He saveth none by force: all freely His yoke bear. 62 “It is our highest bliss to feel we serve Him freely, who to save us freely came— To feel that we have no desire to swerve From holiest service—that we know no aim Or will but ever, with the holy flame Of love, to burn towards Him who loving gave Himself for us. How worthily His name Could we extol, if each were but a slave In ace! It would the worship of high heaven deprave.” 63 “How clumsily men frame their theories Of right!” Winfred resumed; “in our dark time, We strove poor heathen men to christianize, Believing unbelief a damning crime, Even when of every Christian truth sublime They were as ignorant as a child unborn! Nay, this strange misbelief became the prime Incentive to our warfare with their scorn And spite, that we might save them from their fate forlorn. 64 “No gentler motives had our hearts impelled To venture 'mid their swamps and forests wild, And dare their savage rage. Had we not held Them lost—lost irremediably—exiled From bliss for ever—we could not have toiled To martyrdom that we might save their souls. Thank God! that now the darkness that defiled Our vision is removed. No wrong controls His government: we now discern, wherever rolls 65 “A world that holds His creatures rational, There all are judged by perfect equity; Not equity by wits fantastical Apparelled with the seeming drapery Of fairness, though, in truth, 'tis tyranny Abhorrent to the sense of right in man Implanted by his Maker.” “We with thee Adore,” spake Leddra, “Him whose marvellous plan Gives all within the moral and intelligent span 66 “Of His high rule probation fair and free And noble. How we could have feared that ire Consuming from His holy hand must be The lot, inevitably, of son and sire In utter darkness born—that endless fire Should be their portion who ne'er knew His will, And therefore could not guiltily conspire Against His holy government, is still Our wonder, and must aye our minds with wonder fill.” 67 “And yet,”after some silence, Adalhere Spake thoughtfully, “when we beheld how base, How vile, how shudderingly soul-stained they were We saw bow down to idols;—how no trace Of purity remained in them;—no place Within their hearts for aught but lowest lust, And dark desire, and passionate embrace Of foul indulgence;—how could we have trust That any of their fallen souls would live among the just?” 68 “And in God's holy word,” spake Hubberthorn, With slow and gentle speech, “we were not told That when men's souls had passed their mortal bourne, There might be to the gaze of some unrolled A second scene of trial. If so bold Our minds had been as to affirm what none Could truly say, in covenant new or old, God clearly had revealed,—nor His own Son,— Had we not trespassed, and beyond our duty run?” 69 “To be not wise above the written word,” Meekly said Mary Dyar, “even when the power Of God's own Holy Spirit within us stirred, I always thought was safest. Yet the hour Hath been, on earth, when a rich spiritual shower Of knowledge fell on us, from heaven, that shewed Us meanings in the word which, heretofore, We saw not. May not deeper meanings crowd The written page not yet revealed unto the proud, 70 “Who trust in their own reason?” “If the heart Of truth,” young Burrough said, “seek truth from Him Whose word is truth, will not He truth impart Unto it in the reading, though with dim Unlearned gaze the page be read? They trim The outward lamp in vain, to read and learn, Whose minds with self-conceit unto the brim Are filled; and do not for God's own light yearn: The natural man doth not the things of God discern. 71 “The Gentiles having not the law, a law Were to themselves, the apostle briefly wrote: Briefly, yet fully. Men may safely draw Safe inference that the law of conscience ought To be, and will be, only against them brought When they are judged.” “But, since even conscience fails To give a truthful light to men untaught Christ's truth,” said elder Howgill; “it curtails Even good men's hope for men where heathenism prevails. 72 “Yet, if good men were wise as well, some aid For reaching deeper truth they might have gained By patient thought. In God's own image made— His moral image—man is not disdained By his great Maker, though so foully stained By sin. He doth not cast men off—their being spill— As some men blunder God hath blundering reigned In His own universe: not able ill Or good to make of some, for lack of forming skill! 73 “God never moral agents made to end Their being eternally, though they would break His laws persistently, nor would amend Their lives at His entreaty;—nor doth He slake His vengeance by inflicting on them ache And torture endless, though they did not know His law. He doth poor heathen souls awake To after-life, and therein doth bestrow Their path with motives that may lead them from all low 74 “And base preferments into choice of good. All glory to His holy name! in vain Christ hath not for the heathen shed His blood; Millions, in that great spiritual domain Of Christ—the after-life of men whom chain Of earthly circumstances bound, enslaved, And crushed with weight of evil, —now the strain Of gratitude swell high, that their depraved And fallen souls Christ hath from endless ruin saved!” 75 “‘Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?’ I answered oft,” spake humble Trowell, “when Lewd London wits, falsely named erudite, Mocked at all Christian teaching, in that den Of beasts London became when citizen Aped harlot king, in revelry and sneers At purity and truth. I answered men, When any heathen soul 'fore God appears, That he will find hard measure I can have no fears.” 76 “And that the simplest faith is oft more wise Than logic subtleties, I make no doubt,” Again said Winfred; “ yet the tears and cries Of million sufferers in the lands without Christ's gladdening gospel; and the maddened shout Of thousands, when beneath the ponderous wheel Of some huge idol's chariot falls, devout, The Hindoo suicide; the hideous zeal O' the heart for sin, which Asian city-crowds reveal; 77 “The brutal cannibalism and murderous strife That stain so foully yon sweet South Sea isles; The dark infanticide; the waste of life In every vile indulgence that defiles Both body and soul; the thrift of priestly wiles; The fattening of the priest, and suffering lean Of yon poor pilgrim, whom the thought beguiles That he shall win heaven's bliss by tortures keen, And crawling vilely on the earth, like things unclean;— 78 “Oh, who can think of Man where yet the sound Of Christ's dear name was never heard, or where Men's erring souls reject Him with profound And stolid ignorance that His yoke to bear Would make them free, —and not desire to share, Again, the cheering toil, the suffering sweet Of Christ's blest heralds who His truth declare To heathen men; and teach them to repeat His name; and lead them for salvation to His feet!” 79 His look was lit with light of pitying love For souls of men still living in the gall Of bitterness and bond of sin. Above, Around, there seemed to glow, and soon to fall, A crowning radiance, on the heads of all:— A token bright that all the Martyr band That loving spirit sweetly did enthral, And that with joy, at God's supreme command, They would return to earth to toil in heathen land! 80 “Let us rejoice,” spake Winfred yet again, “That now the ministry of love is ours, As spirit-messengers from God to men; That, sometimes, He our essences empowers To aid with strength the poor weak soul that cowers At shapes of superstition, and doth pant For spiritual light where heathen darkness lours On every side, and nought is ministrant By tongue, or eye, or ear, unto the heart's deep want. 81 “But lately, Eoban and Adalhere And I, most gladly hastened to obey Our gracious Lord's behest, a poor fakeer To help with spiritual whisperings of the way Of life. In old renowned Benares lay His skeleton form upon an iron bed, For five long years. We heard him mourn and pray To many demon gods with names of dread, That he to purer light and safety might be led: 82 “He vowed to arise, and creep on hands and knees To any idol's shrine, however long The journey were, in order to appease The wrath of Seeva, or the vengeance strong Of Doorga or Kalee! or, with the thong Of knotted whip to lash his fleshless frame; Or scorch his limbs with fire; or any wrong From men receive in silence, even to shame Of spitting, or contempt outpoured upon his name. 83 “The light of conscience had grown feeble and dim; But, as that light is quenchless in the breast Even of the savage, it still lived in him— Nay, had become a spectre of unrest Unto him. Bodily pain did not molest His thought; beneath no suffering did he faint: With burden of sin alone he was opprest:— Oh, that he could be cleansed from sin's dark taint!— He cried, all day, and oft all night, without restraint! 84 “At last, a sleek-fed Bramin saw him lie, And proudly bade him rise, since now the coin Was spent that he had saved by toil,—whereby His meagre food was bought,—and said,‘Go, join The crowd of labouring men, and cease to whine About the burthen of thy sin, and strive To bring fanams to Veeshnu's sacred shrine— For that will better please the gods—to give— Than thus, in sloth and pain, a loathsome life to live!’ 85 “A crowd of gazers raised him; but the use Of joints and thews was hard to be retrieved. He lived, but paid the forfeit of the abuse Of life for those five years: unto him cleaved Palsy and pain, and inwardly he grieved, Alway, with burthen of his sin weighed down. The fakeer's iron bed, he still believed, Nearer true light had brought him; and a groan Oft told he wished for leaving it he could atone. 86 “His misery had grown sore, and all could tell Around him that Insanity would claim Him for her victim, if he could not quell His fiery torture. So with noisy blame They urged him to remember the great name Of Juggernauth, whose worshippers oft found Relief o' the soul when, sunk in sin and shame, They had of life been weary. And, soon bound To Orissa, toiling on, he reached the festal ground. 87 “But—not to worship at the shrine obscene! 'Twas God's own gracious Providence, we felt, That led him thither. One with humble mien, A Christian teacher, stood, and meekly dealt Out truth to the crowd. Full soon the heart did melt Of the poor listener! 'Twas the real relief His soul so long had sought. In tears he knelt At Jesu's feet; and, like the dying thief, At once was pardoned, and escaped from all earth's grief! 88 “His joy destroyed his earthly life, but brought Him joy in heaven! Oh, many will yet believe In Jesu's saving truth, they long have taught The dark Hindoo so patiently. It doth them grieve That they so little of success achieve— The lowly teachers who cross ocean-tide To win men's souls for Christ; but we perceive Sure signs of coming harvest which shall wide Wave o'er the world. In grateful patience let us bide!” 89 “Ever in grateful patience, and in faith,” Said meek young Parnell; “God hath also sent Us to that land where men to shapes of death And murder bow, while still to them is lent Such light of conscience that, in discontent With their own fallen nature, they still crave To lose sin's burthen, or that life were spent. And they who yield to Christian teaching brave Endurance need, while their own sires around them rave 90 “With horrid cursing, and their mothers curse More horridly the children they have borne; And children curse their parents who rehearse The name of Jesus, as their Saviour. Scorn And hatred, and a menaced life forlorn, Or loss of limbs, or death, await on them Who dare decide for Christ. If some return To their old vileness, bravely some contemn All threats of danger, holding precious Truth's bright gem. 91 “They who, in England, mock the enterprise Of Christian men that preach to the Hindoo, And, scoffing, ask why he so long defies Converting power, and is so hard to woo Unto conviction, and change old for new, Might cease their gibes if they would mark the tale Of truthful witnesses. How long the True Shall thus be martyr to the False, we fail To know: yet know the True most surely shall prevail. 92 “It shall prevail as surely as God lives And giveth life to all that live throughout His universe. Himself the assurance gives; And He Himself is Truth. His foes so stout Shall yield; the falsely wise shall cease to doubt; Barbarian darkness shall behold His light; And universal nations join the shout That God hath come to reign in truth and might: God and His Christ have come to bring the reign of Right!’ 93 New radiance fell upon that company Of loving Martyrs while young Parnell spake, And lit their faces with such heavenly glee Of holy love, it seemed in me to awake Deep longing that I could such love partake. But, now, soft strains of music that I seemed To recognize began, forthwith, to break Upon my spiritual ear: the strains I dreamed I heard before: above, around, they sweetly streamed! 94 And lo! above the Martyr band appeared The hand of golden light all quickly saw, And, seeing, seemed with expectation cheered Of higher joys. It did their footsteps draw Unto the terraced mountains, which, by law Of their blest spiritual existence, all Must at appointed seasons, with rapt awe Ascend, to enter at the trumpet's call High heaven, and share its worship in high festival. 95 The mountains ever green, my mind discerned, Did picture endless life, and endless bliss, Attained by all who climbed them—all who yearned To be for ever good: from wrong and vice Set free—from hate and rage and prejudice For ever: and their essences imbued With love and purity: no thought amiss: No wrong affection: no solicitude— Except to be in holiness for aye renewed. 96 The mountains all were terraced, as I knew Intuitively, that in Christ's rest so bright No thought of labour might bedim the view Of His dear saints at home. So light Was the ascent, it seemed to some a flight In ether. Yet the sense of order stilled Each mind, as if the want of it would blight Their bliss. So up they stepped, as troops well drilled Step lightly, without toil: each heart with joyaunce filled! 97 And as they 'gan the terraces to climb, I saw their steps were timed, as in my dream I saw before: a triumph-march sublime It was; and as they marched they turned the theme Of their late converse to a tuneful stream Of choral song; and thus the Martyrs sung:— “We come, O Lord, to share the quickening beam Of Thy bright glory with a grateful tongue, For that Thou hast our hearts with chords of gladness strung. 98 “We laud Thy wondrous love, eternal, vast, And infinite as Thine own Self, that found The ransom for our souls: the love Thou hast Displayed for fallen man—that doth abound Even for the deeply fallen! O that around Thy throne may soon be gathered millions more Who grope in heathen darkness, where the sound Of Christ's blest name none bear, and none adore Thy glorious majesty, Thy wisdom, love, and power. 99 “Reclaim the nations, Lord! Bring back the lost— The wanderers through long ages! From the chain Of guilt and misery let the captive host Of heathen men be freed! O let the reign Of Thy dear Son begin! To swell the train Of His long-promised triumph, let men come, Who long in degradation dark have lain, Blinded and maimed, in Superstition's gloom,— By Christ redeemed,—to share the brightness of our home! 100 “It would Thy heart rejoice that they were saved: It would Thy saints rejoice to see them blest: O Father, save our race by sin enslaved! Thy Son hath died Thy grace to manifest: Send forth Thy healing Spirit to quell the pest And plague of sin: Thy saving health dispense O'er all the earth, till every human breast Be consecrate to Thee with love intense: All rebel wills be bowed in sweet obedience!” 101 Their song was longer; but a sudden sense Grew in me that I must not share the sight O' the City of God, or join the confluence Into its gates of God's own Martyrs bright, As heretofore, or scale the mountain's height; But must return to earth. I woke, to wait My final call. Lord, while I strive to fight The fight of faith, help me to vindicate Thy truth, and win the fallen from their low estate! BOOK THE FOURTH. 1 O fair young Moon, if there were nought but thy Bright crescent to attract men's gaze from earth, It were enough to make them bless God's sky! The children love to see thee, and with mirth Welcome thy coming; and to Age thy birth, Anew, is ever gladdening, as a sign That Nature is not old, but still brings forth Her undimmed glories, and her gifts benign— Sustained in during energy by the Hand Divine! 2 What countless, million-million, mortal eyes Have watched the swelling of thy silver bow, Until it grew a shield—then shrank in size, And vanished, to appear again a show Of beauty above all stars that sparkling strow The vault of Night. With what joy-ravishment The first young human pair the primal glow Of thy return first saw! How oft hath blent Fears with the hopes of later mortals when was bent, 3 Once more, thy shining form above their heads, And corn-fields cried for the reaper, but the rain Fell, pitiless: the rain that surely sheds Its torrents by thy fickle leave: the swain So held it. And, now men, of science vain, Disdainfully regard the Past, they hold It still the same. Although in thy domain, They swear, there is no moisture: But a cold, Dry, lifeless cinder is thy seeming face of gold! 4 When sweet young eyes so often by thy light— Blest boon for lovers!—wandered to breathe sighs Of tenderness and constancy, a slight On thy bright form, they would have deemed surmise That thou wert aught so mean. With their own eyes, Did they not see that Sabbath-breaking Jew Who gathered sticks i' the wilderness, his prize Upon his shoulder, ever exposed to view, A prisoner in thy orb, rolling amid the blue? 5 Argal, in thee there must be living things!— What, if in thy mild region still dwelt fair, Though fallen, angels, who with feeble wings Ventured, sometimes, down through the lower air, To whisper mortals, and to sin ensnare— For that they were themselves ensnared, not prime In sin, and therefore were not doomed to share Great torment: yet the wish grew, with their crime, To spread for other souls of sin the deadly slime. 6 But thou the lamp for fairy revels wert, My grannam said—for her own grannam saw The little people gaily dance and flirt, I' the mystic grassy ring, with shivering awe, And spake aloud!—not knowing the mystic law That would subject her to their mighty power— To tickle her nose and ears with an oaten straw, And pinch her sides in sleep; turn the milk sour She had left in dirty bowls, and play pranks, hour by hour— 7 All in the night: they had no sunshine game: 'Twas all by moonshine! And when they were seen By mortals who were silent, good luck came To the man or woman. Gold was found, I ween, I' their shoon, i' the morning; if the poor to glean Went forth in harvest, they would gather sheaves! The bullfinch would not rob their cherry treen; The swallows would build, and twitter, 'neath the eaves; And luck come naturally as fall the autumn leaves! 8 Thou wert the patroness of so much good I' the time of Fancy, that one shrinks to tell, Fair Moon! how thy account of evil stood; How thy eclipse foreshadowed griefs to quell The stoutest heart: shipwreck and storm, and yell Of drowning sailors; and conspiracy, Secret and dark, and murderously fell, 'Gainst kings; and overthrow of cities free; And famine and plague, and every dread calamity! 9 And was it all a dream, fair shining Moon? Does thy eclipse forebode nor good nor ill? Will fairies leave no gold in idlers' shoon? Are all the fairies gone, and must we till Our ground with sweat o' the brow, and must we still Ring out our toil on the anvil, and work on, Or starve? And, in thy realm, doth no sweet rill Murmur, or river flow? Is the dream, too, gone, That angels lived upon thee? Is there never-a-one? 10 And art thou, seeming splendour of the night, Only a cinder, lifeless, dark, and cold? Then we will bless thee for thy borrowed light; And still more bless the goodness that doth hold Thee in thy orbit, by the rule untold Till Newton scanned it, and, thence, safely scanned The vast mechanic system manifold Of central wheel and wheels dependent, planned By God's own wisdom: formed and held by His own hand! 11 “God, acting in His own great universe”— So, when one asked what Gravitation was, The immortal sage defined it, in his terse, Significant way. He did not care two straws What critics, foolish and fine, prated of “laws.” He knew that law could not itself maintain: There must be the Unseen Sustaining Cause, To ensure the sequence men call “law.” In vain Even Halley doubt pled often: Newton, with hands twain 12 Held fast his faith; and, with a lowly mind And truthful heart, kept on his wondrous way To the end. 'Tis not in lowliness mankind O' the scientific class, in this our day, Shew greatness. They their searching wit display In spying “evolution,” everywhere— “Selection natural,”—and the sovereign sway Of what they call “development.” O rare Development of wit! what fools our fathers were! 13 They thought God could create, if that He chose; And had created. Sages of science, now, Shake their small heads, and mutter they suppose 'Twas a mistake! But, if you ask them how The universe came to be, they say they trow 'Tis better to say nought: 'tis not for frail, Imperfect mortals, such as they, to allow Themselves in airs pretentious the dark veil From Nature's face to lift—the veil all-mystical! 14 And this sounds modest; but men need a rest Both for the heart and mind. No Godless creed— If one may call it so—can ease the breast In trouble; or the heart's affections feed With satisfaction; or within us breed Resolve to battle with temptation strong To moral evil. Surely, no great greed A man will feel to conquer sin, so long As he believes not in the Judge of right and wrong. 15 I would not hastily condemn. God knows I have great cause, remembering errors past, To shun hot speech. But why this prate of “laws,” And “reverence” for them? Each encomiast Of our grandees of science utters fast And loud his praises for their championship Of Truth. But what is their Truth worth? A vast Dim waste of words it seems to me to skip From sequence unto sequence, and yet never grip 16 The deeper Truth—that there must be a Cause For all this sequence, though it ever be As fixed as they assert it is. No “laws” Are known by stones or trees, by sky or sea; Nor can they, senseless, pay a penalty For disobedience. Men discern full well They break a law when pain or misery Succeeds an act. Rocks, trees, or waters tell No sinners' tale of suffering, for they ne'er rebel. 17 God makes a law for free-willed essences— Angels or men. Man in the plenitude Of regal power; or, where true freedom is, Men representative make laws, and rude Rebellion 'gainst them brings on humble and proud— Or should bring—penalty most sure. We all Admire right law, and sensibly conclude Them wise that made such law; but never call A law its own enactor. Why should mortals fall 18 In “reverence” before sequence which they deem The “law of Nature”? Surely we should rise Above such heathenism, and God supreme Over His realm of Nature recognize, Nor dare to say His power to the All-wise, Almighty One is fixed. The summer air Invites. I have performed my exercise Of duty, and should sleep; but they so fair And bright appear—the beauteous stars!—that I must share 19 The glorious sight, once more. How full of life Must be the world-stored universe of God! Yon glittering splendours cannot be unrife With conscious being. Each sphere is surely trod By moral agents: not the mean abode Of animal natures only. 'Twere to deem God's work unworthy of Himself to load Immensity with suns, if every beam They shed, however bright, shewed only Death supreme; 20 Or, merely forms that simply live and feel, But neither know, nor thought reflective share. Creatures, God made to inherit bounteous weal, According to their natures; and His care Of all shews that His wisdom deems them fair; Yet, higher joy must fill God's holy mind Looking on Man, than on the forms most rare In outward beauty to the earth assigned, That are to all earth's truly beautiful so blind. 21 And, if the all-bounteous Father doth feel joy In giving life, and higher joy the more He gives of higher life, nought should destroy Our love of life. To deem the gift but poor— The highest gift that God, the Great Bestower, Can give, is surely base; and baser still It is to wish Death should our being devour. Thank God! I never felt such wish: no ill With hatred of Existence could my bosom fill. 22 I love existence. And I would not die, Although I'm old, except to live again, And think, and feel, and know, and satisfy My being with comprehending what all men On earth can only apprehend. The ken All-spiritual I long to have—the gaze Angelic, gleaning, at once, what in this den Of clay-bound mind we cannot reach, though days And years be spent in trying to pierce the Stygian haze. 23 And yet, how know we that the essences Of things are better known to angels than To men? Man knows most surely that he is; But knows not what he is. Can angels scan Their own existence, through and through, with span And compass of familiarity, And say, “We know ourselves”? No more than man, I trow, can aught created boast, with glee— “We have the key that unlocks Being's mystery!” 24 “As gods ye shall be!” said the snake to Eve; And still man whispers it to his own ear. And while he doubts so much he should believe With childlike simpleness, he feels no fear To grasp his Maker's attributes, or near Approach to make, at least, to what God's hand Alone can do. I would not tarry here To learn such “science,” though they call it “grand;” But, for right aims, I still would live in Fatherland. 25 Not many have seen more of it than I: Its hills and vales and woods; its streams, its strand; Its quaint old cities, and its hamlets shy; Its crowded, gay, new towns bizarrely planned; Its moated castles, and its abbeys grand In ruin, with its proud cathedralled piles. Through shire and hundred, over Fatherland, On foot, by wain, on steed, what merry miles I've sped! The thought with pleasure still my heart beguiles. 26 I love existence. Never can return The hours of youth or manhood; but I feel 'Tis pleasant, oft to let the mind disurn The Dead beloved, and bring them back to seal Old friendships o'er again; to think o' the zeal We felt in our debates—the merriment— The fire—the fun—the wish the hour to steal Past midnight: then the grave rebuke swift sent From brows of senior “take care!” men—so eloquent! 27 I thank the Almighty' Maker that I've lived, And feel life hath been blessed. What, though pain Hath mingled with my ease? I have not grieved At pain so much as at my inward stain Of sin and guilt. My life hath been, i' the main, A pleasant pilgrimage. I cannot hold With him who scorns this life, as but a vain And worthless dream, soon over and soon told: A dream that doth mere changes of a dream unfold. 28 Life hath been real to me; real in its joy, And in its sorrow. And the reality Of life I would not lose. No pleasures cloy In life that men name rightly. If their free Heritage of choice men will abuse, yet see The issue must be punishment, the blame Is justly theirs. Men know the high decree That links their sin with punishment and shame, And know their arguments against it halt and lame. 29 The men I knew who said, “There is no sin: Creatures of circumstance men are; and praise And blame are follies”—I ever heard begin To praise and blame, if to forget their craze You could beguile them. In the startling days Of forty-eight, old Robert Owen said His solemn say, very oft—“He but betrays His folly who blames and praises.” Ere his head Was turned, he praised and blamed the living and the dead! 30 I well remember how his new-found friend, Young Louis Blanc—an exile—sat by his side, At Ashburner's, the opening and the end Comparing, of his speech. Puzzled, he tried To unravel it, but failed. I had to hide My face for laughter. But, the old man's look Was quite triumphant; and he glanced with pride Around,—as who should say, “No sovereign duke Or king can match my greatness: I no equal brook!” 31 Self-worship was his foible—nay his sin! And all his followers to the top of his bent Befooled and flattered him; and did but grin At others for born fools who shewed they lent No ear to Robert's teaching. No dissent Was borne with. His was the name o' the Age! “The Age of Owen” 'twould be called when blent With dust he was! They told him so! The sage Nodded,—as he would say,“That's true, a crown I'll wage.” 32 So proud at heart—and yet how meek and kind He was, even when the storm of anger swelled Around him! Imperturbable his mind In contest seemed, when younger; but he held His head up loftily, in age, and quelled Dissent with words that shewed he deemed men low In intellect who could not see he excelled All teachers of his time. So surely grow Proud thoughts in man whose fellows weakly to him bow! 33 Yet, one feels glad to have known a man that drew Thousands around him who became so sure That what he taught was truth. Alas! how few Are able to resist a panic! Be the lure Substance or shadow, when the calenture Sets in, the human sheep begin to run; And, soon, all run who see the race! Impure, Unholy license seemed a precious boon To fools. Some saw their folly ere life's task was done; 34 But Owen never changed, or faltered. From The outset of his course he seemed possessed Of rocklike strength of will. The masterdom Of all men's ills should yield to his behest, He told the crowds. They could suspect no jest: He gave his wealth, his time, to spread the scheme Of Socialism. He never seemed distrest At failure; and when others ceased to dream Of winning Eden back to Earth, and said no gleam 35 They saw o' the promised light, he widely stared, And said he wondered, for the light was full— Nay, fuller than the sun's own light it glared: The triumph was at hand: their eyes were dull Who could not see the signs of it. No lull Of earnestness he shewed for fourscore years; And, in old age, he said nought could annul His triumph: it was come! They gave him cheers: He was stone-deaf: I do not think they reached his ears. 36 Owen has gone; and, with him, too, his sect. And Communism hath, once more, had its day Of murderous rule, in Paris! All bedeckt With beauty was their city, when a stay But brief I made in it—although the fray O' the Reds with Cavaignac was barely o'er, And their new President did not display His purpose to be Emperor yet. She wore Her splendour still—the famous city—as of yore. 37 Frenchmen were proud of Paris—even the poor, As were the rich: they hurled no monument down, Although they soaked the stones with human gore. The column in the Place Vendôme no frown Provoked—the Louvre's array of art no groan Evoked of hatred from the workmen-bands That struck for broader freedom. Now the tone Of Labour's sons is changed. They say the sands I' the glass of Privilege are spent: all with their hand. 38 Or heads shall labour, for the future. “Pride And idleness should have no rest,” they said; And so they burned their city, and defied All retribution! though their land had bled Beneath the Prussian's proud revengeful tread, They turned to shed each other's blood! The old Mad zest for civil strife is still misbred Within them. God forbid we should their mould So fraticidal take—'midst changes manifold! 39 For change hath come in England that I deemed Unlikely yet to come, for many a year; And other changes threaten. It had seemed Great cause, indeed, for joy to me to hear Some changes had been wrought; but now a fear Checks my new joy that License soon may come— Wild License, rather than the triumph dear Of Liberty, in this dear isle, her home So long—where all her exiled sons find welcome room! 40 After such midnight musing, slumber came. And, soon, the wakeful mind—as a player would say— Caught up her cue from these last thoughts, to frame Her converse in my sleep. I dreamt my way I took again, in Paradise, where lay Familiar flowers: the bell-flower tall and fair, That blooms by rocky Tees, even near the spray Of the High Force: grass of Parnassus rare In beauty—nay, most beautiful beyond compare— 41 That decks the banks of forked Tyne, Where he turns south, by old quaint Alston, high Above all towns in perch,—and where, with fine Sense of the beautiful—(sure, bending nigh, The angels whisper them!)—one child doth vie With another in reverence for the fresh “God-flower”— For so they name it! And that living eye, Or star of the earth—the Trientalis—dower Of loveliness—that one would gaze at, hour by hour! 42 It grows in the park of Alnwick—but we found It first in Scotland—I and my Love—near chill But cheerful Grantown, where frail flowers abound: The fairy orchis, with its infantile And chaste white florets: pyrolas that thrill The soul with wonder at their gracefulness; While gymnadenias rich perfume distil Around your heathery path; and lady's tress Renders your power to name its beauty languageless. 43 I dreamt such flowers I found, but each enhanced In delicate grace of form, richness of scent, And bloom, till, as before, I seemed entranced To ecstasy, amid such lavishment Of loveliness and sweetness. But soon lent I hearing to the voice I dreamt I heard Of one discoursing in a strain that sent Strange vigour through me, as when one doth gird Himself for fight—for fiery words his blood have stirred. 44 I knew it was the voice of Claude Brousson, “the Evangelist of the Desert”—See a good, compact life of him, published by Hamilton, Adams and Co. 1853. The Preface is signed by “Henry S. Baynes.” “The Evangelist of the Desert”—martyr brave, Who, strangled on the wheel, with soul so strong Met death, at Montpellier, when Louis drave From France its holiest sons—himself the slave Of Rome, although “Magnificent” proclaimed— Louis “le grand Monarque”—to whose blood clave The vengeance of the Lord, when men's hearts flamed With hate of kings, and Pride and Privilege were tamed. 45 With Claude walked other martyrs by the wheel: Dumas, and Fulcran Rey, Guion, Bonnemere, And Olivier Souverain, ... and other martyrs of Montpelier. —Their deaths are all described in the volume I have just mentioned.—who all with leal Fidelity and readiness did bear Their torture, and escaped to Christ. Their share Of bliss these now were reaping; and with them A crowd beside of brothers, each now heir Of Jesu's heaven. And all seemed, in my dream, Intently listening to the Desert Preacher's theme. 46 “Brothers,” spake Claude, “regird the loins o' the mind; And still take heart that we the combat keep With Rome's dark falsehood—though we find Her power so strong, her hold so wide and deep O'er human hearts, when we descend the steep To earth, on God's great errands. Let us hold His promise fast—that He will call His sheep, In every land, into Truth's holy fold: Let us hold firmly by His word proclaimed of old!” 47 He paused, as if reluctant to speak on, From large emotion, —while his brethren held His form in silent deep observance. Soon, The fact to me was mystically revealed That Claude, but now, had from his ancient field Of warfare and of suffering journeyed home, Again, to heaven; and had not yet unsealed His later knowledge, whether the day of doom They waited for so long had come for slaughterous Rome. 48 “Tell us, loved brother, if our own loved France”— With meek impetuousness, spake Fulcran Rey— “Have left the spectacle—the song—the dance— Her boast of victories—and begun to pray. We learned that there the priest had lost his sway O'er men, though women seek his benison. We wait to know that Frenchmen change their gay And volant life, for earnestness. Soon gone Will be Rome's power, if Frenchmen grave and pious have grown.” 49 “Ye marked my hesitance,” Brousson replied; “I cannot tell ye that our France grows wise Or pious. Still she keeps her boastful pride And vanity—although the Prussian dyes Her soil with blood, and still for vengeance cries, Remembering the dread wrong he suffered while The wasteful Corsican won victories Like sports, and fed his eager hosts on spoil, And humbled kings, as if they were but peasants vile. 50 “I deem, my brother, that thou judgest right: Rome's day is gone when France casts off her yoke In earnest, and no longer, in loose plight Affects to wear it, as a masterstroke Of policy. When neither jest, nor joke, France makes of Christian truth, but with the force Of all the reason that she boasts, the Book Reads for herself, and reads with the remorse Of conscience, she will soon break down the Papal curse. 51 “But, even now, Rome seeks on her to lean: Fallen Rome on conquered France! The old man shorn Of territory and civil rule, with keen And smarting sense of the Italians' scorn— For oft they jest around his nest forlorn, — His petty realm—the City Leonine, Across the Tiber—still uplifts his horn Of pride, and dares to mutter curse malign On all his foes; and frets till France doth give the sign 52 “That she will yet befriend him—for no friend He hath 'mong reigning potentates: none heed His blessing or his curse. Some think their end— The end of kings—is near, and feel they need To care most for themselves, since treasons breed So fast around them; while the stronger strive To strengthen more their thrones—ignoring creed And faith—by following plans preventative, They think, of revolution: for they now perceive 53 “The earthquake threatens, throughout Europe broad, From Labour's children, who so small a share Of good gain for themselves, although they load Others with plenty, by their skill, and toil, and care. The earthquake threatens; and strong kings for war Myriads now train, and the dire drame pursue With deadlier weapons; and auxiliar Artillery, more deadly still, now through The air whirls weights of metal such as men ne'er knew, 54 “Or heard of, since the warring world began; And ships are clad with iron plates, immense In thickness, —and impelled with hurricane Velocity, by force of steam, intense. Thus, horrible destruction, at expense Enormous, emperor, and king, and czar Make ready, confident, when Turbulence Sounds trumpet, with the giant game of war To wield off revolution, or subdue its jar! 55 “Our own loved France—now bruised and bleeding France— Raves, too, of warlike preparation, quick, Like conquering kings—nay, with an arrogance The nations round deem nought but lunatic, Boasts her revenge shall come, and she will strike Her foes with such paralysis of fear, They at her feet shall crawl, and, trembling, lick The dust! To pray, didst ask, my brother dear, If France had now begun? Such tidings we shall hear 56 “From earth, in God's own time, I trust. But prayer Is farthest from her thought—of all the thought That enters human minds, when filled with care, And torn with sorrow, for the suffering brought To their own doors, upon their hearths, about Their beds—sorrow o'erwhelming to the mass Of men—but sorrow Frenchmen learn to flout With merriment, and mockery, and grimace! Oh, when, great God, shall reason truly mark our race!” 57 Silent, the Martyrs walked, when Brousson ceased, In holy sorrow, till Bonnemere thus spake: “And who hath ruined France? who, but the priest— What, but the subtle power of the fell Snake Of Rome—did first the strength of Frenchmen break Under the yoke? How long and bravely strove Our grand forerunners, who the chain, and stake, And fiery flame, with spirit of the dove Endured—blessing their foes who them with fury drove 58 “From life, although their lives to France had been Unmeasured good! How long we strove—our aim How pure—God truly knows! The haughty, unclean, Yet worshipt king—the pride, and yet the shame, Of France! —yielded, at last, to play Rome's game To the full; and, in expelling from his land Its Christian people, struck the blow to maim Its industry and wealth: his court, so grand, Robbed Poverty of its bread with unrelenting hand; 59 “And vice and waste became the heritage Of his doomed house, till Misery rose with fell And fierce revenge to crush out Privilege! And still they hear the voice of vengeance swell Above the roar of war; and who shall spell When it shall cease?”— “And when from France the true Disciples of the Lord were driven”—to tell His thought, Dumas began—“the Atheist crew Soon gave the tone to court, and crowd, and science, too. 60 “When nought was left to represent the faith Of Christ, but mass idolatrous—the bread Turned into Deity by the noisome breath, Perchance, of some foul priest, and overhead Held up for worship; while the incense spread Its odour round; and eunuch songsters strained Their hireling throats, by opera music led; And cloth of gold unto the priest pertained, While rags scarce clad the peasant whom the Church had drained 61 “Of his last mite—what wonder that the minds Of men revolted with disgust from show And showman too? Few, now, the forgery blinds, 'Mong Frenchmen; but men much more easily throw Their idols down than learn to humbly bow 'Fore sovran Truth. Oh that the Lord would raise Up for Himself, in France, some teacher low In men's esteem, but who with Truth's pure blaze Should fire French souls, till they proclaim the Saviour's praise!” 62 “God hath His witnesses, though few”—in haste, Spake Claude:“a remnant of our race give ear And heart unto the truth. They have embraced Its teachings from the stranger, and hold dear The word of life. Brethren, we will not fear! Their number shall increase, till France shall be Among the foremost nations that revere The Crucified; and, over land and sea, Her sons shall champion the new Christian Chivalry!” 63 “Lord, let Thy servant's faith be realized Right early!”—prayed the Martyr company, Aloud;—and sounds that shewed some sympathised With them, in Paradise, were heard. The three Brothers Du Plans co-workers also with Claude Brousson. approached, with holy glee “Amen” responding: with them, David Quet, —Broken on the wheel at Montpellier.—For a record of his martyrdom see also the “Life of Claude Brousson.” And elder martyrs twain—Pierre de Bruis, see note 6 And Henri, “the false hermit,” Pierre de Bruis and Henri, “the False Hermit”—See some account of their labours and martyrdom in a translation of Antoine Monastier's “History of the Vaudois Church,” published by the Religious Tract Society. as the men of prey Misnamed their victim, in the famed St. Bernard's day. 64 And, after these, drew near a Martyr crowd— A crowd innumerous—that on earth were named With many names—some given by wicked, proud, And persecuting men; and some that epigrammed Their virtues. They who, when the faggots flamed Around their limbs, at Lyons, aloud exclaimed They saw the heavens opened; and, at Toulouse, Where met, i' the Middle Age, the Council famed For persecution, they whom its foul abuse Meekly received, and dared its sentence murderous. 65 And they who bled or burnt, for stubborn faith, In Gascogne, and Provence, and Dauphine; And, in Lorraine and Picardy, met death Exultantly: some called “The men that pray,” And some “The men that sing:” some termed the stray Dwellers with wolves, or Turlupins. The poor That loved them called them “pure”—Cathari: they— The proud—who hated them, never forbore To give them names of guilt, without a metaphor. 66 Poor Men, Poor Weavers, Publicans, Beghards, Beguines, and Manichees, some chose To call them, as they wandered o'er the plains Of sunny France, or climbed the Alpine snows, Or hid in Pyrenæan vales from foes; And Albigenses were they called, who fell In thousands by De Montfort's sword Simon de Montfort. —One hundred thousand crusaders (and some say more) in 1209 ravaged Languedoc, and slaughtered countless “heretics,” under the leadership of Simon de Montfort, and Amalric, the Abbot of Citeaux, and legate of Pope Innocent III.—the blows Approved by Rome, who said the work was well And nobly done: work worthy of the fiends of hell! 67 Anon, joined these, another Martyr host: The Vaudois of Provence, whom fierce Oppéde The Baron Oppede. —The merciless butcheries, devastations, and nameless horrors executed upon the poor Vaudois of Provence, under the fierce leadership of this man, are vigorously related in a crowded volume entitled “History of the Protestants of France,” etc., by G.de Felice. Translated by P. E. Barnes. Routledge and Co. 1853. Slew with the sword, or burnt—a holocaust To glut his bad revenge—the slaughter made By order of the king, won by the aid Of Cardinal de Tournon: penitent In death, the royal Francis strongly bade Henri, his son, to follow with punishment The guilty deed: a charge to which dull heed was lent. 68 The gathered Martyr companies of France That lived, on earth, some centuries apart, Yet gave each other the fraternal glance, And seemed a mighty army of one heart. Forthwith, in serried ranks they formed athwart The flowery plain, as if their wont to meet Thither, it were—not to record the smart Of their past martyrdom, but one to greet Another, and rehearse old earthly memories sweet. 69 Their greetings all renewed, the waving Hand Of Light again appeared above. All saw The signal, and the universal band Struck up the song of praise and love and awe, With mingled prayer for France—the holy law Obeying which, in Paradise, doth bind All souls from earth, and did them thither draw, To pray their Lord for those still left behind, In Fatherland, that they may all His mercy find. 70 “Great God of might, who dost all worlds possess— Creator of our being—Redeemer strong From sin—and Sanctifier who dost men bless With heart-renewal, and grace to leave the wrong And cleave unto the right! Again, our song We raise—our brother-song of grateful joy— That, though we grieved Thy holiness so long, In mortal life, Thou didst not us destroy; But didst preserve our souls to share Thy blest employ! 71 “O Holy Lord, make bare Thy sovran arm, And from our Fatherland old Error chase! No longer let the priest, with baneful charm, Delude men's souls! No longer let our race Give up their souls to folly and foul embrace Of deadliest sin! Thy power to humble pride, O Lord, Thou hast displayed before their face, With awful force, and still Thou dost them chide— But, by their blinded eyes Thy hand is undescried. 72 “O God, let men, throughout the humbled realm Of France, begin to think—until from off Their eyes the scales shall fall, and shame o'erwhelm Their souls that they so long have lived to scoff At things Divine, and to deride all proof Of Thine Existence, who so long hast borne With their foul sin. Let Frenchmen keep aloof No longer from Thy Christ! Oh, let their scorn Of meekness end! Lord, beam upon their souls forlorn!” 73 The prayerful song went on—the fervid plea For France, that God would cleanse her mental sight From folly's films, her veil of vanity Remove, restore her spirit from the blight Of scepticism, and fill it with the bright Perception that in Christ is true repose— Repose her restless spirit needs to upknit Her ravelled strength, —to still her strifeful throes, — And a transcendent future for her sons disclose. 74 Their prayer harmonious ended; when began The brethren towards the terraced hills to wend, In serried ranks. The Martyr caravan, Triumphant marching, did its wings extend Across the plain till the low hills ascend I, erst, saw in my dream: the river's marge It also touched; and often seemed to bend Its lines by the winding river: space so large It filled. —But, now, I heard one Mind new thoughts discharge. 75 'Twas one whose flesh by pincers was torn off— Bold John le Clerc, The woolcomber of Meaux is an observable figure among the martyrs of France. “In his zeal against the deceiving errors which he saw abounding on every hand, he involved himself and the good cause he had at heart in common ruin, by rashly offending the most cherished prejudices of the prevailing creed. The inhabitants of Metz, whither he had withdrawn, were accustomed annually to repair in crowds on an appointed festival to a neighbouring chapel, where a statue of the Virgin, with others of favourite saints, were the objects of special devotion to the credulous and ignorant populace. “Like Paul of old, the spirit of Le Clerc was stirred within him to see the city thus wholly given to idolatry; and, forgetful of the example of the apostle in like circumstances, he repaired at an early hour to the church, and breaking the images in pieces, he scattered them before the altar. Though no one witnessed the daring sacrilege, Le Clerc had no desire to flee. The act was designed as a testimony against the sin in which the people were preparing to unite; and when he was dragged before the judges by an enraged multitude, who could hardly be restrained from tearing him in pieces, he fearlessly proclaimed to them Jesus Christ as the sole object of rightful worship. “The courageous confessor was sentenced to be burned alive; but even a death so horrible could not satisfy his enraged executioners. He was mutilated and torn with red— hot pincers, and his sufferings were prolonged with the most savage ingenuity; after which the sentence of his judges was carried into execution by burning him in a slow fire. . . . While his executioners tore his flesh, and mutilated his face, in a manner too horrible for description, he solemnly ejaculated the words—‘Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them. O Israel, trust thou in the Lord: He is thy help and thy shield.’” they martyred in Lorraine, For that, with fiery zeal, beneath the roof Papists called holy he broke their idols vain To pieces. To the few I saw remain— Brousson, Bonnemere, and Dombres —He and Boisson, both colleagues of Claude de Brousson, went to martyrdom, at Nismes, singing the praises of God, and “finished their course with joy.” —I heard him say, “My brothers, we can never here complain Of what doth seem the All-wise One's delay In saving France; but, how mysterious seems His way! 76 “He leaves the land which so much martyrs' blood Hath consecrated, and where Mind hath won Its proudest triumphs, —in its hardihood Of unbelief and pride to wander on; — And seeks the barbarous races 'neath the sun: The dwellers on the islands of the sea, And far-off continents, but dimly known When we were sharers of mortality— Lo! while I speak, the new-born spirits hither flee! — 77 “For Sin with Holiness the war on earth Will wage till comes the end, and ever slake Its thirst with blood of Saints—yea, count it mirth To see their bodies writhe with torturous ache, Or burning. So, some hither from the stake Now come, and some slain by the piercing spear; And from the rock let fall to earth, where brake Their bones, others have come. Welcome, ye dear Disciples of our Lord! —We give ye heavenly cheer!” 78 “Welcome, dear brethren, from the island far, To Jesu's Paradise!” aloud Brousson And his companions cried; “ye welcome are To all God's Saints!” I knew this Martyr throng From Madagascar came—the island, long And broad, the channel named the Mozambique Divides from Afric land. Victims of wrong They felt they were, and did no pardon seek, But met their death with joy, and Christian courage meek. 79 Victims of Ranavalona Queen of Madagascar.—How this woman, who had no rightful claim to the throne, seized it, on the death of King Radama, has been related in English periodicals many times. The reader will find a compact account of the Malagasy martyrs in the “Narrative of the Persecution of the Christians in Madagascar,” etc., by the Missionaries Freeman and Johns. London: Snow, 35, Paternoster Row; as also in “Madagascar: its Mission and its Martyrs,” published by the same house. —savage queen— A demon-legion seemed to fill and rule, As when Christ dwelt on earth, the spirits unclean Possessed the man: the evil spirits so foul, That, driven out of man, they begged control O'er filthy swine, and gained their strange request— Christ—as the Judge of men—letting the shoal Of swine be drowned, His mind to manifest— The Jews, by keeping them, Jehovah's law trangressed. 80 Sisters there were, as well as brethren, in The island Martyr band. The queen so vile Spared neither her own sex, nor her own kin. The maiden Rasalama, —The calm, but glorious death of this proto-martyr of Madagascar is beautifully told in the last-mentioned little volume. with a smile— As proto-martyr of her native isle— Led on the Christian company. Her hand She gave Rafaralahy, “My sister, I will not leave you to the end.” said this young man, separating himself from the crowd to walk by the side of Rasalama, as she was led to death. A few days after-wards he, also, was martyred. the youth who while They led her forth to death, with bravery grand Walked with her as she sang—spite of the queen's command. 81 Full soon it was his turn to die. They slew Him as he knelt where her unburied bones Were strewed. And more they killed. I fear, all new Ye would their names proclaim, and strange the tones, If I pronounced them! Few to their death groans Gave heed, in‘Christian’ England—where the boast Is rife— “There are no Martyrs now.” “The moans”— Say ye? —“were faint on that far southern coast”? Truly, full oft their moans in hymns of joy were lost! 82 “Sing us, sweet sister,” spake Brousson, “the hymn We heard that thou didst sing when thou wert led To martyrdom.” The Malagasy martyrs all went, singing hymns of praise, to the place of death. This so enraged their persecutors, that at last they stuffed straw into the mouths of the sufferers. To me her words were dim: The melody with windings seemed to thread The spiritual air, till—as the great one said— With “linkèd sweetness long drawn out,” the mind O'erpowered seemed tears of tenderness to shed, With rapturous thrill. Thus sounds are intertwined With feeling, whether in earth or heaven, for human-kind! 83 Then sang the Malagasy, in their tongue, And with like tenderness, in joyous strain, And in full chorus, other hymns they sung In their late days of martyrdom and pain. Their music rose above the flowery plain, Until I saw the infant company Of Welcomers gather in troops, amain, And float o'erhead, and list with ecstasy And wonder, what the music, new to heaven, might be. 84 And then, in spiritual tongue, the men of France Spake with the Malagasy of the time Of persecution—when no sustenance They gat, for days, i' the woods, and had to climb Rude rocks, and hide in caves, or in the slime Of swamps, to escape their hunters; and the hate O' the wicked queen to flee: their only crime They worshipped Christ, and would not fall prostrate 'Fore blocks of wood by ignorant heathen consecrate. 85 With grateful joy the Malagasy told How first the missionary-men to preach Began, and how some felt that truth gat hold Of all their heart; and when by signs to teach— By printed signs as well as spoken speech— The men began, what wonder, and what zeal Some felt to learn until their minds could reach The meaning of God's word, and sweetly feel What great salvation for their souls it did reveal. 86 And how they hid its precious leaves, when raged Fierce Ranavalona, and nightly drew them forth From their concealment, and by stealth assuaged Their thirst for the living water: how i' the earth They hid Christ's printed truth, and with what mirth They dug it up when none of all their foes Were nigh. And then, how great they deemed the worth Of Bunyan's Pilgrim-story “Bunyan's Pilgrim-story.”—It was translated into Malagasy by Mr. Johns, the Missionary; and soon the natives prized it next the Bible. to disclose Their hearts began—yea, told of it with rapt applause! 87 “O brethren, these are wondrous ways of God!” Said Claude; “how know we but this savage isle— For such was Madagascar, when we trod The soil of earth—may, in the Future, smile Triumphantly o'er Hellas, and the land of Nile— Yea, over Europe's proudest boast of art And science? Oft doth God select the vile, In men's esteem, to enact a lofty part:— What, if this isle be set down in some future chart 88 “O' the world, as the pre-eminent Christian seat Of knowledge and refinement? God may bring Judgment upon the nations that maltreat His truth, and deem it false; that madly wring From intellect and sensual revelling, Alike, the dregs of pleasure; and ignore Their Maker's name; yea, proudly backward fling His benefits, and call them curses. O'er Our ancient home awful judicial change may lour!’ 89 “Cast not away blest hope!” with cheery shout, Cried one who led another band in view, While thus the Preacher spoke of fear and doubt, And to the terraced mountains nearer drew The Malagasy and the friendly few That journeyed with Brousson. The Martyr band That now approached, thus cheerily led, I knew, By mystic insight, were of Gallic land, Likewise: its ancient Martyrs: they who bore the brand 90 Of infamy, when pagan Rome held rule, And savagely shed Christian blood for game, By scourge and torture so unpitiful, 'Twere hard to tell: worse than the fiery flame! And dread exposure, 'mid the loud acclaim Of thousands, to the claws and teeth of beasts Wild from their scorching Afric clime: no shame They felt to boast refinement, yet such feasts They held i' th' amphitheatres, with brutal jests 91 Mocking frail woman's sufferings, as of men The groans. 'Twas Polycarp's disciple “Polycarp's disciple,” Irenæus. —He was martyred at Vienne, in Gaul, A.D. 202, in the persecution under Severus. led Gaul's ancient martyrs. He who in Vienne Was slain. And, with him, they whose blood was shed So recklessly in Lyons, by the dread Decree of Antoninus Verus, blythely trod The floral way: Pothinus, —See Eusebius, Book V.C.I.whom from bed They dragged—the man of ninety—to give God His dying testimony, and seal it with his blood; 92 Sanctus, the deacon, stout, defiant, brave, Amidst all threats and tortures; Attalus, Maturus, Vettius, and the female slave, Blandina ... and others.—See Eusebius, Book V. C. I. —noblest martyr for the cross Of all her sex, in times iniquitous; And many more. “Cast not away blest hope!” Cried Irenæus; “still remain for us God's patience and His love. Let us look up, My brethren, yet, for fallen France! Let not faith droop 93 “While the great Intercessor pleads in heaven, And saints on earth. Asunder, God the veil Of scepticism will rive, as He hath riven The veil of heathenism! France shall the trail O' the serpent see, ere long, and humbly wail In penitence, that she so long hath held The false for true, for pure the bestial: Shall mourn she hath the power of Evil swelled; And grieve 'gainst God and Christ she hath so long rebelled! 94 “Cast not away blest hope!” again he cried, “Blest hope we may not, will not cast away!” Cried all the Martyr company; “Christ died For sceptic, as for heathen, Gaul: her day Of grace is not yet past: full soon the ray Of holiest Truth, with soul-awakening might, May beam upon her. Send it, Lord, we pray! Let France no longer be a realm of night; But shine among the nations, by Thy Gospel light!” 95 The prayer and song went on, as now to climb The terraced mountains they began; the song Went on—and other songs, with chaunt sublime, The joyous myriads sang—the happy throng That, marching, climbed the height with step so strong And limber: age and weakness felt no more! They climbed—but sense that I might not prolong My visit to that realm grew, as before, Within me; and I woke to find myself on shore 96 Of earth, a pilgrim still: Death's mystic sea Uncrossed! Yet, I must cross it soon: the years Must now be scanty that remain for me On th' hither side o'the tomb. Life onward wears Happily, thank God! Scarcely a “vale of tears” This life hath been for me. Still let me prove My happiness in Duty: then, no fears Cold Death can bring: 'twill be but a remove From happy life below, to happier life above! BOOK THE FIFTH. 1 The winter's sun beams bright, as if'twere spring, Gladdening the waters of the lonely sea: Lonely as death: not even a bird on wing: No glimpse of man, or boat: a jubilee Of silence and of death, it seems. With glee The unburied giants of old Cumbria wear On their huge shoulders their death drapery— The pall of snow. Wide Morecambe sands are bare, But sparkle, as if strewed with dust of diamonds rare. 2 All things are bright, though silent. Overhead There is no cloud: 'tis one deep vault of blue That mocks the eye to gauge it. If, instead, I look upon the waters, without clew Or rod, for measurement, I am: I view The boundless still; and still within me rise The old, old baffled thoughts I yet pursue, But can achieve no end. Oh, for new eyes Of Mind, to pierce the deep, the eternal mysteries! 3 I had a friend, in youth, I loved full well. He was no mannikin—no dapper thing That smirks, and reckons Life a bagatelle; But girt the bow of his mind with steely string, And shot far after Truth—within the ring Oft planting his arrow where her jewels glow, All-priceless. Humble in birth, he was a king In thought. I see his broad Baconian brow Brighten, as mind-fire flashes in the eyes below; 4 I hear his manly tones announce the clear Decision he had raught, when we the fray Dialectic,—stern, unbending, and austere,— Had waged for hours. And now I hear him say— They were his dying words—for soon the clay That glorious spirit left: “Oh, how I long To be all intelligence!” Thus did he pray In death: prayed from the passions' blinding throng To escape for ever, that on Truth, with vision strong, 5 For ever he might gaze: with spiritual eye— The eye unlensed, unorganed, unbeshrined In flesh, undimmed by vulgar slovenry Of earthly use. He prayed that as pure Mind He might exist: not only unconfined By shroud o' the flesh, but unannoyed, unstained By the foul cleavings of all humankind To the earth, which do convince the soul, sore-pained, That, while on earth, unto the grovelling clay 'tis chained. 6 Hath he his dying wish obtained in death— That is, in the real life beyond the grave? For, since 'tis not the kernel perisheth, But only the shell, one cannot choose but crave To know what kind of life our spirits have Unclothed upon with flesh. Doth he still see— Hear—feel? Or, did the senses but enslave And dull the soul's perceptions—while, now, free From sense, she is Perception's self—the destiny 7 My dying friend aspired to—and now he Is “all intelligence”? Yet, often he said, In our tense arguings, that it could not be For any mere creature to have being unwed To vehicle, or clothing: only the Dread, All-infinite One could be pure Mind. And then, If asked—How such thought-regions can we tread? He quoted Cudworth—whose intellectual ken He deemed the strongest of all late Platonic men. 8 And thus men quote, and reason still—or guess; But get no farther! Yon big cumulus cloud Hath suddenly risen from some lake's recess, To hide the lordliest mountain in its shroud; And Coniston Old Man, that looked so proud Above his fellows, is invisible— While more clouds pile upon the obscurer crowd Of peaks, and make them seem to bulge and swell Till they in stature Alps or Andes would excel. 9 Let me leave clouds and mountains, for the sea! Our reasoning is but rasher guessing, full Of fancied peaks from which immensity, We think, at last, we fathom. We are dull Scholars in learning how to pick and cull True treasure from the trash of our own thought. All reasoning on the eternal future null And void must be. What God hath left untaught About it must be best unknown, or left in doubt. 10 Let me breathe freely thy fresh air, glad main! And, thankful, gaze upon thy boundlessness— What, though I try to measure thee, in vain? He measureth thy waters—measureless To man—in the hollow of His hand! Transgress Thy bounds thou canst not; neither can I mine. It will be wisest for me to repress Guesses about the Future, and resign My soul with confidence into the Hand Divine! 11 I thank Thee, Lord, the days of arrogance Are past, when I presumed Thy government Divine to arraign: with rash precipitance, Forbidding Thee to punish sin unblent With blame of Thine own creatures, on earth sent To do Thy will, but given to have a will Themselves. I thank Thee that the veil is rent Of pride; and, since Thou only know'st how ill It is in man to sin—his span of life to fill 12 With base ingratitude for all Thy care Perpetual, all Thy love unwearied,—new Ever, each night and noon and morn,—I dare Not judge what sin deserves. Thou only true And righteous judgment canst pronounce, whose view Is blinded by no error, and whose right It is to judge. That punishment is due To baseness here, men doubt not: to requite The lawless, would on law and justice be a blight. 13 Man's teachers now are saying, on every hand, What I once rashly said and sung—that pain And punishment cannot be ever: bland And bountiful and tender, doth Thy reign In Nature Thee proclaim; and every grain Of Gospel truth is sweetened with Thy love: Thou canst not punish ever, and the stain Of evil from Thy holy throne above For ever see—men say: it would Thy being disprove! 14 Vast Sea! how little of thy compass can I judge from this scant spot on which I look Upon thy waves? And can it be that Man The slave of sin—from his dim finite nook— Doth claim to read, off-hand, the eternal Book— The Book o' the infinite government of God? Surely, Unerring One, Thou dost not brook That men, unblamed, should thus assume the nod Divine—should thus forget their kindred with the clod! 15 Farewell, grand Sea! I may not soon upon Thy waters look again, and try to read Thy healthful lessons. Hence, I must begone, Away from silence, to the crowds who lead Their lives in noise and haste, and greatly need Patient and thoughtful guidance from the way Of Error to the paths of Truth. Lord, speed Me in my aim to spread Thy Truth, I pray— For soon I shall have lived, to the end, my little day!— 16 I left the realm of silence by the Rail. There was no Rail whereon the steam-steed sped With snort, and puff, and haste to turn men pale With fear, and fill their hearts with instant dread Of death, when I was young. But steady tread Of waggon-horses, stout and strong;—the dash Down hill and up, o' the mail, without a shred Of fear, to coachee's chirrup—not the lash O' the whip; the cheery horn; no dread of deathful crash! 17 “Oh, for the dear old coach again!” I cry— But soon remind myself o' the pelting rain, And that umbrella which the old man would try To hold up still for shelter with insane Resolve, although it drenched our necks; the pain Of sitting, crampt, for lack of room; the wind That kept us in one posture, like a chain— It was so keen! And then I am inclined To own 'twas well men did the steam-steed find, and bind! 18 I left the realm of silence, and arrived, Once more, i' the realm of noise, and haste, and toil: The realm of cotton mills, in which seemed hived Man, woman, child: all join the gainful moil, 'Midst heat, and rattle of machines, and broil Of steam. And still they build new mills, and vaunt That nought their manufactures spread aslant Until their enterprise shall henceforth foil The world—where'er is found the human habitant! 19 But thirty years ago, Lancastrian land Was filled with discontent; and ghastly fear Prevailed the Poor would seize the pike and brand, Through hunger-bitten madness, and ungear The chariot of the State, and Order sheer Overboard cast into the abysmal flood Of universal ruin. Many a seer Proclaimed that revolution, battle, and blood Must come, if men and women and children had not food. 20 How the sage holder of the reins displayed his skill, And starving crowds gat food, there is no need That I should tell. When hungry men could fill Their stomachs, they soon ceased to list the rede Of Agitators. “Let us work, and feed And clothe ourselves and children,” soon became The all-prevalent resolve. They worked with speed; And when broke out, across the sea, the flame Of war, and they could get no cotton, they did not blame 21 The “Cotton Lords,” of whom, in bygone time, They spoke so angrily. Their common sense Kept them from insurrectionary crime; And, famine-stricken though they were, suspense Of work and wage with patience most intense Was borne. And, now the wheels go round Again most merrily, thoughts of turbulence Return not—for men's eyes upon the ground, Are fixed: to thoughts of food and clothes their minds are bound, 22 Except where curse of gambling hath possest The souls of men and women—for to share This madness of their husbands, with wild zest, Women are found! No more, i' the open air, I see, at eve, pale, eager groups, with rare, Though homely eloquence, holding debate— Their heads unhatted, and their lank limbs bare Of clothing, save with rags—far on, till late Dusk hour: and still they lingered to deliberate 23 How freedom should be won, and man be ruled As man, by his own free choice, not as a slave!— And hath the fervent thirst for freedom cooled? “You see the ragged crowds no more!”—with brave Display of triumph, they proclaim, and wave Their new-bought hats! Most gladly I discern The rags are gone; but sorrowfully crave Whither had fled the intelligence, and stern Passion for freedom with which once they seemed to yearn— 24 The starving “Mill-hands!” Was thy word then true— Sage Age-fellow illustrious, that—spite all The cry and rage and threat against the Few That rose from the Many—'twas not to disenthrall Themselves from serfdom, but to make their call And shriek of hunger heard till they were fed? 'Twas all that Chartism meant; and now the tall, Grim scaring spectre flees—for men have bread To the full; and all their say for Freedom they have said?— 25 Then, from my inmost soul, I sorely grieve That I and others bore for such as ye— The grovelling sons of sires who could upheave The world with fear—whose rags, so vile to see, Were robes of honour, for they were the fee Of independence!—sorely grieves my soul We bore the chain for such as bow the knee To Pelf and Privilege, so that the dole To work for wages they may have. Is this the goal 26 Of Freedom? Have ye reached it, then, so soon? And now, with hands in pockets, ye can prate Of shares in stores and building clubs; and—boon 'Bove all!—can bet on horses—like the great! Or, on the flight of pigeons; or, elate With idiot pride, lead greyhounds in a string, And bet upon the swiftness of their gait!— For, now, all's well! With scorn, aside ye fling Fantastic Freedom, and vote the way sure bread to bring 27 Into your cupboards! Ye are men of sense: Your ragged sires were fools, and dreamers wild. Freedom to feed ye prize: with abstinence And Liberty ye cannot be beguiled; For ye have tasted bread, and said, and smiled, “'Tis sweet, and we will keep it. Take our vote And welcome! Rule with hands clean or defiled, So long as we can feed to the full. A groat We care not how ye rule; on that we spend no thought!” 28 And did we brave the dungeon, but to know That toiling men have sold their birthright like Esau of old, for a mess of pottage? Low, Indeed, your starving sires, who talked o' the pike, Would say their well-fed sons had sunk! Heart-sick To see such degradation, they would be, And cry—“Ye strike for wage—but why not strike For Freedom? Ye who have the vote, like free Men use it: your own hands now hold your destiny!” 29 My hour of teaching came; but there came few To listen of the hands-in-pockets crowd: They flocked to gaze upon some gew-gaws“new From Lunnon!”I to my lodging with a cloud Of moody thinkings paced— Hush! hush! the shroud They are preparing for the breathless clay That held the noblest soul on earth! No proud Large-acred duke, or gartered marquess they Adorn with heraldry, and clothe with Death's array. 30 “The great Triumvir,”saith the printed sheet Of evening news,“hath died at Pisa.”Fame Shall now reverse her trumpet, and, with meet Proclaim, speak of an actor in the drame O' the Nineteenth Century, whose high-souled aim None equalled. And Italia's passionate heart Shall sob with penitence, and throne the name Of her Mazzini far above the smart And courtly names of men that played their part 31 Of seeming patriotism, for kings to win Continuance of their sceptres. Ay, 'tis night With the poor lifeless clay: shrunken and thin It lies, no doubt! Quenched are those lamps of light— Those “windows of the soul”—so dazzling bright When it looked through them, while he thought and spoke Of home! —so full of splendour and of might, When from his eloquent lips the syllables broke Of fair Italia fully freed from foreign yoke, 32 And then united: Tuscan, Piedmontese, Roman, Venetian, and Sicilian land, All one freed home for patriot hearts at ease! Old feuds now mourned; and thrown away the brand So often drawn to shed with brother's hand A brother's blood! The worn, thin clay is cold And lifeless—but, I dare be sworn, 'tis grand In death! No soul e'er left a nobler mould; And still, I doubt not, it is beauteous to behold! 33 How glossy were his raven locks when first I saw that classic head! But when I saw Him after his return from Rome—the worst Having befallen his rule, from the fell paw Of France—and while I gazed, with sorrowing awe, Upon his face, I marked his head was gray! I spake on't—but it only served to draw A smile from him:“We watched, by night and day, While Garibaldi and our Romans kept the fray”— 34 He calmly said—“with the French and Oudinot. I never slept on a bed, and only ate Dry bread and raisins, while they met the foe; And Saffi, and I, and Armellini, sate To mete out justice—or deliberate What next to essay. The Corsican's false heir Hath blasted our fair hopes. But better fate Awaits us. Never, my friend, can I despair: Our cause shall yet, in Rome, victorious laurels wear!” 35 Where shall his tomb be? In Santa Croce's fane, Where sleep the grandest of Italian dead? Mazzini's bones were worthy to be lain By the bones of Angelo, the sculptor dread, Or Galileo's—but his final bed Should be in Rome. She was the darling dream He cherished: Popeless Rome become the head Of Italy: her beauty, again, the theme Of all; and crowned with her freed People's diadem! 36 Oh, honour the dead clay, Italians, for The sake o' the soul that wore it! Honour well The clay, for the soul's sake; but homage more The lofty memory of the man! Oft tell Your children how he toiled, amid the swell Of tyrant rage, and failure of his plan, So oft renewed, the Austrian's pride to quell, Freedom restore, and Italy in the van To place, of nations: the Great Realm Republican! 37 Say how he toiled and never fainted; nor His toil gave up till death! So deep, so true Was that great love to Freedom which he bore, And to his darling Italy! Ever grew The affection with his years. He never knew An ebb and flow of that great love. 'Twas one With his own being: a love that did imbue And colour all his thoughts, and give them tone: He lived and breathed in that great love, supreme, alone! 38 Champion of“God and Duty”—for they were Thy watchwords—who shall now the counsels guide Of Freedom? Only one true arbiter She needs: the Man of Equity. Low Pride That pulls down higher Pride—setting aside One wrong to plant another—doth but breed New troubles, and impede the gladdening stride Of Freedom. Had poor France but taken heed To thy sage chiding, she had now been free indeed. 39 Farewell, grand Soul! Rienzi meets thee there, In Christ's bright heaven—the heaven of truthful souls— With Brescian Arnold, and the man of prayer, The martyred Savonarola: men, i' the rolls Of Papal Rome, set down to share the howls Of the accurst. Thank God, nor Pope, nor Priest, Shall be our judge! 'Tis He alone controls Our destiny. —Grand spirit, take thy rest With Him and Christ, in the sweet regions of the Blest! — 40 Midnight hath found me pondering, once again, The change of earthly things. One cannot hear That great ones die, and pass it by, as men Pass by the deaths of every day—no tear Shedding, or heed vouchsafing to the drear Dull tale. — I slept again—the sleepless Mind Still of her waking thoughts keeping a clear And vivid hold—and seemed to tread the assigned Realm of the Lord's beloved, whom evil men maligned 41 And martyred. By the winding river I seemed Again to walk; but ere I stooped to take One growth of that sweet floral land, I dreamed The forms I kenned of two that, while awake, I thought of sorrowfully. One of them spake With the bold martyr who to fiercest flame, — By cunning of the Pope he caused to quake, — Was doomed at last: the Pope whose English name Was Breakspear: none more skilfully played the Papal game. 42 Girolamo Savonarola told his heart, In Paradise, with forceful yet with meek And gentle speech. Arnold of Brescia's His triumphant patriotism and mortification of Pope Adrian (Breakspear), with his fall and martyrdom by burning, at the command of the Pope he had humbled, are among the most romantic incidents of Italy's romantic history. part Was sterner. As, in life, he never sleek Or servile features wore, or uttered weak And wavering words, so now he seemed to look And speak as one who lived in days antique, And lineage claimed with men who could not brook The thought of slavery, much less bear its hateful yoke. 43 Truly Italian souls they were. Their inward fire Of patriotism was equal. One had learned To mitigate his speech, so that no ire Was e'er suspected. In the other yearned O'er Italy a soul that often burned— Some hastily said—with flame that made them fear It was unchastened. But the pure discerned No sin in all his warmth. Thus, oft, sincere And fervid souls are judged with judgment too austere. 44 “They flung thy ashes to the Tiber,” said The Florentine, —Savonarola.“and to the Arno mine; And soon the sea commingled and outspread Them o'er the globe. And so each foul design To frustrate Freedom fails! Though to confine And stifle her life-giving breath they strive, Men's strife but serves to spread her breath divine Till slaves inhale it, and restorative Proclaim her power to every enslaved soul alive! 45 “Kingship—that we ne'er loved—still lives, 'tis true; But our loved Italy owns no despot sway. And, were it not for Loyola's cunning crew, The Papacy would soon see its last day. Oh, surely, on the march of Freedom, may We now congratulate each other, while We laud the Almighty Ruler. Though His way Be in the clouds for ages, they shall smile With joy, who watch with patience how He works His will!” 46 “My joy is feebler, brother, than thine own,” The elder martyr spake: “I long to see Our countrymen unto full manhood grown, In thought and act. Scarcely from childhood, we Can say they have passed, while many a devotee Climbs on his knees the Santa Scala, “Nearly opposite the steps of the church of St. John Lateran, we saw the devout, or penance-performing worshippers, ascending the Santa Scala on their knees. This is a flight of stone steps, said to have been taken from the palace of Pontius Pilate at Jerusalem, twenty-eight in number. The strange spectacle of young and old, rich and poor, fat and lean, cheerful and sorrowful, slow and rapid, clumsy and agile, moving on their knees up those steps, must be seen to be understood. The contortions, the jostling, the groaning, the praying, the kissing the steps, the serious gravity of some, the anxious faces of others, the irresistible tumbling, and, consequently, ludicrous collisions occasioned by the sudden stoppages of others, render the scene mournful, or ridiculous, according to the state of mind of the observer.” “Journal of a Tour in Italy, in 1850; with an account of an interview with the Pope at the Vatican.” By the Rev. Geo. Townsend, D.D., Canon of Durham: page 91. Rivingtons, 1850. [Dr. Townsend was the antagonist of Sir Wm. Drummond, the author of “Œdipus Judaicus.”]day By day; and, when the baby effigy Of Christ—the doll Bambino “We visited the church of Santa Maria d'Aracœli. Here a monk shewed us the far-famed Bambino, a swathed and dressed olive-wood image of the infant Saviour, encrusted with jewels, —which they take, if requested, to the titled and opulent sick. A carriage, two hours after, was seen to receive it and return it. The women in the streets kneel as it is borne past them.”—Page 97 of the same work.—on its way To the sick is seen, Italian women kneel and pray, 47 “I' the open street. How can men call our land— Our Italy beloved—except in whim— A land of Christ, who died that we might stand Acquitted in the Father's sight? The hymn They raise to Mary, Queen of Seraphim, And Mother of God—not to the Crucified! ‘Ora pro nobis!’—how their voices swim, Yet, in our spiritual ear! When last we hied On our Lord's errand, and again beheld the pride 48 “And pomp of their false worship, and the throng's Profanity, beneath that stately dome, How burned our minds with sense o' the Saviour's wrongs Inflicted in our loved Italian home! If Christian martyrs of old pagan Rome Could rise, and see what priests call worship, in You proud basilica, that still the gloom Of heathenism prevailed—the gloom and sin— They would declare: so near to heathenism akin 49 “Is popish worship! Oh, that God would bring To nought the guilty system, and restore His Son's pure truth!”— “To the Eternal King Be fullest praise that on the Italian shore Men scatter Gospel seed! The Christian sower Is free to come, and bring the Bible, too! Doubt not, Italians, now they are free to explore Its truths, will soon, intelligently, the true Discern, and faith in their old priestly frauds eschew.” 50 Thus Savonarola strove the overhaste To check that Arnold felt. But now drew near A band of Italy's martyrs of the Past: Arnulph, “At this time (A.D. 1128) under Pope Honorius II., a certain priest, named Arnulph, came to Rome, a man of great devotion and a distinguished preacher. While he proclaimed the word of God, he rebuked the dissoluteness, the libertinism, the avarice, and the extreme haughtiness of the clergy. He exhibited, for universal imitation, the poverty and life of spotless integrity of Jesus Christ and His apostles. In truth, his preaching was approved by the Roman nobility, as that of a true disciple of Christ. But, on the other hand, it exposed him to the intense hatred of the cardinals and the clergy, who seized him by night, and put him to death secretly.”—Trithemius: quoted by Monastier.the holy preacher, bold, austere, In time of Pope Honorius, who with fear Filled hearts of cardinals and priestly knaves: With fear—not penitence: they shed no tear; But seized him, nightly, by the hands of slaves, And silenced his bold preaching in the Tiber's waves. 51 With him came Martin Gonin, and Varaille, And Nicolas Sartoire, and Pierre Masson, Martin Gonin was but thirty-six years of age. He was sentenced to be drowned in the Isèré, in Dauphine. The sentence was executed in the night. —Geofroi Varaille, aged fifty, was burnt at Turin, 1558. —Nicolas Sartoire, a young student of Berne, was burnt at Aosta, in Piedmont, 1557. —Pierre Masson, a Vaudois barbe, or pastor, was waylaid on a journey, and arrested. He was put to death at Dijon, in 1530.— Monastier. And hundred martyrs more, from many a vale Of Piedmont: poor Vaudois barbes, so long Exposed, with their devoted flocks, to wrong From popes, and priests, and Dominic's black band. Next came Mathurin, burnt at Carignan, in Savoy, in 1560, His wife found entrance to his prison, exhorted him to constancy in the presence of his judges, and offered to go with him to die, if they would give her leave: They granted her request.—Monastier.and his wife so strong In faith, who cried“Don't yield! give me your hand!” And walked with him to burn, with fortitude so grand! 52 Of northern Italy these: the southern clime— The sunny Naples—had its victims, too: Apulians, and Calabrians, who no crime 'Gainst man committed; and to God with true, Humble, and faithful hearts they lived. But who Could 'scape the Inquisition's deadly gaze? — They butchered eighty men with the knife: they slew Them as his sheep or swine a butcher slays, Cutting their throats, in turn. And ere they gave to the blaze 53 Their female victims, sixty were tortured till Some died o' their wounds. Nor did Venetia proud Escape the Inquisition's yoke. Its various skill In killing men and burying them was shewed In Venice: the victim no expense of shroud Needed: tied on a plank, a stone at his feet, Between two little gondolas they rowed Him to the outer harbour: then, with fleet Motion, the boats withdrew. Without a winding-sheet, 54 Their victim found a grave in the lagoon. Giulio Ghirlanda, see note 11calling on the Lord, Thus sank to death; Ricetto see note 11, next; and soon Spinula see note 11, and Fra Baldo Giulio Ghirlanda was the first who suffered martyrdom in the city of Venice. He sank into the deep, calling upon the Lord Jesus.—The next was Antonio Ricetto, a most honourable man. In the gondola he was firm, prayed for those who put him to death, and commended his soul to his Saviour.—Francis Spinula was drowned ten days after Ricetto.—The most distinguished of all the martyrs of Venice was Fra Baldo Lupetino. He was of a noble and ancient family, became a monk, and rose to high rank in his Order. He was imprisoned twenty years by the Pope and the Inquisition, and then put to death. He met his martyrdom with great firmness, and in peace.—“Sketches of Protestantism in Italy,” by Robt. Baird, D.D., of New York.: the record Of all the names were long to tell. Reward In Paradise these found, and to embrace Their brother martyrs came. O'er the green sward And flowery vale, in crowds, they trode apace, While high and holy gladness shone in every face! 55 What famed Italian city had not there A martyr for Christ's unadulterate faith 'Twere hard, indeed, to tell. Florence the fair Had many besides Girolamo to death Who bravely went. And many the martyr's wreath In Parma, Mantua, and Bologna gained; Or in Ferrara took the fiery path To heaven; or, while fierce Spanish Philip reigned, In Milan, boldly in the flames Christ's truth maintained. 56 Whence came the chiefest hundreds of that host? Even from the spiritual Babylon. 'Twas Rome, Herself, that fierceliest kept the demon boast Of zeal in bringing heretics to doom, By fire, or sword, or rack, or cord, or gloom And hunger and silence of the prison cell. Who thirsted most for blood in Christendom? — For blood of Christ's own saints? The tyrants fell Who boasted that they kept the keys of heaven right well! 57 Their greetings o'er, I saw the martyrs group Together, for discourse of what they saw, Of late, on earth; and of their faith, or hope, That popish frauds would cease to overawe Their countrymen, and Christ's pure truth be law, Alone, unto their consciences. Of brave Aspect, Bartoccio Bartolomeo Bartoccio, son of a wealthy citizen of Castello, in the duchy of Spoleto. He was imprisoned, but escaped to Venice and thence to Geneva. In 1567, he was seized in Genoa, by the Inquisition, and sent to Rome, on the requisition of the Pope.“After an imprisonment of nearly two years, he was condemned to be burnt alive. With a firm step he went to the place of execution; and, whilst the flames were enveloping his body, the words Vittoria! vittoria!—victory! victory! were distinctly heard from his dying lips.”—Dr. Baird, in the volume just mentioned. soon began to draw A crowd around: he who was seen to wave His hand, and heard to shout “Vittoria!” when they gave 58 His comely body to the flames at Rome. “Italian brothers, who love Christ!”—so spake The noble martyr; “in our ancient home We see the dawn, at length, begin to break Of that thrice happy day, when old, opaque, Benumbing errors of the soul shall fade Like mists before the sun—when men shall wake And cast off Superstition's dreams, dismayed No longer by the hideous forms such dreams pourtrayed. 59 “What, though Italians linger somewhat, yet, To dash in pieces the false shapes that long Enthralled their father's souls;—to break the net Of Loyola fully from off their limbs with strong And manly effort? We shall hear the song Of triumph soon, o'er Jesuit falsities: The Book of Christ's own truth is now among Them: it lies open to enquiring eyes: The Evangel shall, itself, our land evangelise! 60 “There is no preacher like the Bible's self. The living teacher is but human, like His kind: he may be swayed by love of pelf, Or pride; or may be led astray by sick Fancies that oft mislead even politic And sober men. The Book will ne'er mislead. 'Twill win its own grand way. Full soon the trick Of frightening men from reading it shall breed A proud resolve from frown of priestcraft to be freed. 61 “All hail the happy day, when earnest men And women too, on all the Italian soil, Each day by day, and hour by hour, with ken Of humbleness, and prayer, and spiritual toil, Shall ‘search the scriptures,’ and thus find the foil To baffle, effectually, the guileful game Which priests so long have played, and end the spoil They have made of human souls i' the holy name Of Christ!—Oh, holy Lord, cut short their reign of shame!” 62 “Amen, amen!” responded the rapt crowd— “O Lord, subvert the soul-benumbing power Of priestcraft, in our noble land!”—aloud They prayed—“Thine own apostles trod its shore; Thy martyrs bled upon the sanded floor O' the Colosseum; the cities' streets engrained Have been with many a Christian martyr's gore; Our mountains and our vales their blood hath stained! O Lord! to our loved land restore their faith unfeigned!” 63 “And my soul saith ‘Amen,’” the Brescian said; “But what, if God to answer prayer delay— Prayer scarce accordant with His purpose dread, Or not yet ripened, so that they who pray Can say they know it? He, in sovereign sway, May humble Italy still more;—confound Her national councils;—bring to low decay Her wealth and strength. So long the craven hound Of Austria, unto Prussia next she may be bound. 64 “Oh, who can think upon her worldly glory— Her old, great names of conquest and renown— Her names of patriotism, so bright in story! Her names of eloquence—the names thick strown O'er history's pages—they that wear the crown In Art, and Song, and Music—and not sigh To see Italia sit with face half-prone To the dust, and with half-folded hands—while sky, And earth, and sea, resound with the awakening cry 65 “Of new-born nations who aspire to be A something in the scale, when worth is weighed, And rank assigned 'mong men? Her ancientry Would blush to see of what poor stuff are made Her modern men—mere men of masquerade:— Except the few now leaving earth—the few So far above the rest, each seems a shade Of some old worthy which her soil upthrew When naturally, it seemed, there glory and greatness grew!” 66 “My brother Arnold”—Savonarola spake, With haste, and yet with tenderness, “we are all Italians, and thy words, as a trumpet, wake Our passionate love for Italy! Yet fall Thine accents on our incorporeal And auditory sense, as if they told Thy heart were more upon yon earthly ball Than here, in Jesu's heaven”— “My brother, hold!” Cried Arnold; “think me not, I pray thee, overbold 67 “When I avow my spirit's love intense For earthly themes, though far below the worth Of heavenly. Yet, I hear with reverence Thy meek reproof. For here, if not on earth, The holier soul should have what elder birth Claims there: brethren's obedient love.”— “I join With thee, Bartoccio,” Arnulph said;—“'Tis dearth Of knowledge stops the way. The Book divine, If once Italians search with earnestness, no shrine 68 “Of the Madonna shall find worshippers. Before the gaudy rags with which priests dress Her images, our women shall rehearse Their prayers no more; but hasten to confess Christ Intercessor, who, alone, access Unto the Father opens. And the crime Of years shall end: the crime of heinousness, That set up Mary as a means to climb To heaven, shall never more be heard of through all time!” 69 At once, Italia's myriad martyr host I saw, lift up their hands, and cry, in prayer— “Lord God Almighty, if one holocaust Of martyrdom the vengeful Papal slayer Could make of all our bodies, did we wear Them once again, on earth, we would with joy Crowd to the flames—yea, clap our hands, and bear Them with a shout,—would it the vile alloy Of Mariolatry with Christian truth destroy! 70 “Lord, let Thy servant's prophecy be soon Fulfilled! Let sickly sentiment no more Be misnamed piety; nor homage done To Mary be miscalled devotion. Pour Thy light upon our loved Italian shore— Thy holy light into Italian mind— Until their mid-age darkness men abhor; And seeing how Superstition did them blind, Regard it as the foulest foe of human-kind!”— 71 Forthwith, a venerable sight I saw Of ancient martyrs from Italian land, That seemed their brother martyrs' gaze to draw As they approached. No sons of Hildebrand, Or Innocent, or Urban proud. The band Lowly and meek, they were, that Pagan hate Drove to the catacombs; and thence trepanned, Full oft, to murder them. A throng more late I' the world's record came with them: sharers of like fate, 72 And sharers of their lowly meekness too; But hugely varnished in the midnight time That followed, as saints and miracle-workers true— Some of them Roman bishops, ere a crime Had stained the name of Pope; and some in prime Slaughtered of maidenhood—young virgins fair; And others of their sex, in age. Sublime In bravery, they did the fiercest tortures bear, Until their torturers f?ltered 'fore their courage rare! 73 Popes Clement, Sixtus, Fabian, Felix, all— With Lucius and Cornelius I would not deny to these primitive Bishops of Rome the rank of true martyrs.—though none dreamed Of it—all canonised! The pretence tall, “I am infallible,” none made. Each seemed A child in lowliness. A face that beamed With beauty followed: Agnes, the Virgin: martyred at Rome, in 305. Jerome, Augustine, and Ambrose, join in praise of her virtues.—See Alban Butler's “Lives of the Saints.” the virgin whom Shrewd Diocletian, when he falsely deemed He could destroy Christ's truth, sentenced to doom, With many more, filling his realm with fear and gloom. 74 Laurence, The circumstances of the martyrdom of Laurence, in A.D. 258, are often doubted. But if he really were roasted to death, over a slow fire, on a gridiron, I see no reason to doubt that the intrepid martyr, after suffering some time, should have defiantly bid his torturers to turn him on the other side. the victim of Valerian, slain With tortures most ingenious and prepense; And Roman martyrs in a crowd, i' th' reign Of reckless Commodus, for Truth's offence, Driven to fierce deaths; and more, pre-eminence Of martyrdom beneath the bloody sway Of Decius who obtained; a throng intense Suffering Maxentius caused, ere yet the fray O'the Milvian bridge brought Constantine the victor's bay. 75 And many slaughtered in Maximian's rage; And others by Severus' seeming word Of fairness. Boasting Italian lineage, These, all the gladsome martyrs of their Lord, Now joined in heaven upon the flowery sward, A grateful army, to commemorate The sweetness of their bliss. On earth abhorred Of wicked men, they felt their afterstate The sweeter: it was bliss full-blossomed, consummate. 76 And now, in happy groups—withouten note O' the times in which they lived on earth—for here 'Twas true fraternity—though ages mote Have rolled between their births—in groups of dear And holiest friendship gathered, they gave ear Unto each other how the errand sped On earth, from which they had returned. Austere And brave, as when the forfeit of his head He paid to Commodus, sage Apollonius a Roman senator, was beheaded in the reign of Commodus, after defending himself before the Senate. —Eusebius, Book v., c. 21; Jerome, in his Catalogue of Illustrious Men; Tertullian; etc. said— 77 “On errand of our loving Lord, I stood, Of late, near to the soul of one sore pained And worn by buffeting the surging flood Of his heart's doubts and fears. Renown he gained In college studies, when a youth, and none More welcome would have found if he the pale Of Rome's apostate Church had entered. Groan, And ave, and tears, his sister did not fail To offer to Madonna, ere she took the veil; 78 “And then the simple nun spent half her life In praying Mary from the heretic's snare To save her brother. Home brought daily strife, With father's ire, to Giulio,—mother's prayer And passionate entreaty. If to share The fellowship of young or old he tried, He gat no help, no solace: to beware Of mortal sin, of dark presumptuous pride They warned him: not one strove to cheer him: all to chide. 79 “Young Giulio durst not fully tell his soul To any mortal. Unto God he made His moan: to God alone! The priestly scowl Was on him in the street. 'Neath sun or shade, The wistful maids who saw him inly prayed Madonna to be saved from deadly stain Young Giulio bore—their own confessors said. He struggled with his doubts and fears in vain: He dared not bow to Mary, nor false worship feign; 80 “And, with conviction of heart-sin, he shrank From supplicating God with cheerful mind. Could he have brought his burthen with a frank And filial trust before the Lord—the blind Had fully gaine his sight. But fears had twined Themselves so thickly with his doubts, his gaze, In love, upon the Saviour of mankind He dare not fix—in grateful love; or raise To Him, in cheerful confidence, one note of praise. 81 “He pondered o'er the old Waldensian book, So long in secret kept—the page of light That first his faith in Romish errors shook— Until he shrank with horror at the sight Of Rome's idolatries, and murderous spite Shewn to God's people, and His Truth; and thought, Not seldom, he would tell the truth outright— Would own himself the foe of the Devout, Misnamed; and cry Rome's creed was but a Tale of Naught! 82 “But soon, again, remembrance of his sin Bereaved his soul of strength. He dared not speak Of others' sin, while yet he could not win A sense of pardon for his own. To seek So great a boon aright, he feared—with meek Distrust of his own power—he knew not how; And hourly prayed that God, who aids the weak, Would strengthen him the way of life to know And enter on it boldly, spite of every foe. 83 “Our ministry—in answer to his cry— The Lord vouchsafed unto him; and, in deep Dependence on our Guide Divine, the eye Within we strove of blinding films to sweep, And fix it on perception that to reap In joy is promised unto them that sow In tears. Some strength he gained, but soon o'er-cheap He deemed salvation was, by faith: with low Prostration he must still, with tears, in secret, bow. 84 “We dreaded, now, lest penance, and the scourge, And all the false humility and vice— Not virtue—wherewith monks affect to purge Men's sins, should fill his fancy, and entice Him to attempt himself to pay the price Wherewith his Saviour had already bought His soul and ransomed it for Paradise. Our dread grew gloomier, for his mind, o'erwrought, Seemed sinking—when the Hand Divine deliverance brought. 85 “An English Christian—whom young Giulio met Amid some ruins, where, to nurse his grief, In solitariness, and 'scape the fret And torment of being watched, i' the fall o' the leaf, He wandered—courteously besought a brief Historic reason, if young Giulio's lore Were rich enough to give it,—like a reef Of rocks the sea hath left far on the shore— Why there lay ruins which such marks of beauty bore. 86 The question pleased him, for he knew each stone And vestige well of Rome's rich treasure-heap Of ruins. And he pleased the stranger. Flown Was twilight, ere their walk was done. No peep O' the moon was yet: and, 'mid the dark to creep From stone to stone, they tarried—for the theme The stranger touched made Giulio's spirit leap With eagerness. Denouncing Rome's dark scheme, The English Christian shewed how freely did redeem 87 “Men's souls, He whom the Father's pitying love From His own bosom gave. Young Giulio's eyes The darkness hid, and much his spirit strove To hide its tempest—so long used to spies And listeners—but, o'ercome with sweet surprise, He told his secret. Now, the stranger blessed The hour the Guide Divine—who doth advise His servants true—had led him to the quest, Unknown, of one who panted for the Saviour's rest. 88 “Experienced in the windings of the heart And intellect—the wards o' the locks of thought And feeling—the good stranger drew apart The fastenings of young Giulio's mind; upcaught The meaning of his failure to be taught The truth of Christ by th' old Waldensian book; And gave him—such the words—‘a treasure fraught With priceless wealth.’In his young hands he took It, while his frame throughout with grateful tremor shook! 89 “It was the Bible in his native speech. God shone upon it as he read. In Rome, Now Giulio doth, each day, Christ's gospel preach, Where'er a poor man opens his mean home To let the word of life be heard. They come And listen, stealthily or boldly, while The preacher onward speeds; and, readily, some Ask for the Book, and buy it. With the smile Of scepticism some hear; and pass on to revile. 90 “For Doubt abounds: its name is legion. Where Hath Rome's old tyrant power 'mong men been felt, And human souls a strong deliverer Not sought in sternest doubt—scorning to melt In tears, where men so long have bowed and knelt In childish fears? Doubt still abounds; but death To doubt the Book in many hearts hath dealt. 'Tis seed-time yet. The harvest comes, God saith. We rest upon His word whose name is Truth, in faith!” 91 To Apollonius, while he told his tale Of sorrow and joy, some hundred audience lent; And when he raught the end, they did not fail To thank the Guide Divine. Meanwhile upsent Were songs of praise. 'Mid other groups were blent Like laud and joy, others told how fared They, in their visits to old Earth. Intent All seemed on learning what they chiefly cared To know: that faith increasingly by men was shared. 92 Just as the Hand of Light again was seen, And the glad myriads in due order filed Across the vale, their march unto the green And terraced mountains to begin,—it thrilled My soul to see how that large army smiled To see another Martyr band advance— A glorious band—confessors undefiled! To join their brethren. Who were these? One glance Sufficed to show they fell by Rome's intolerance 93 In Piedmont, when rose the solemn hymn, “Venge, Lord, Thy slaughtered saints!” from Milton's soul; And Cromwell threatened English vengeance grim That made the Pope turn pale, and stop the foul And bloody massacre. Mother with infant roll They did adown the rocks: atrocity The Savoy Duke endeavoured to control, But could not. The Pontifical decree Was given in haste: Rome feared the fiat of the Free! 94 One noble heart came up with these, although He died before them. He who sang the song Of Simeon, in the fire—“Now lettest Thou “Thy servant, Lord, depart in peace!”—So strong The heart of man God makes to bear vile wrong! Thus brave Bazana of Luzerna a nobleman burnt to death at Turin, on the 23rd Nov., 1623. They bandaged his mouth, as he left the prison. “But, as the executioner was tying him to the stake, the bandage fell off, and the martyr thus proclaimed the cause of his death:—‘People,’ he said, ‘it is for no crime I die, but for seeking to act in conformity with the word of God; to sustain truth against error; to—’Here the Inquisitors stayed him, by putting light to the pile. Bazana set up the song of Simeon, as versified by Theodore Beza, that touching canticle sung by the faithful of his Church after the sacrament— ‘Laisse-moi désormais, Seigneur, aller en paix’— But his voice was soon silenced by the flames.”—See “The Israel of the Alps:” translated from the French of the Rev. Dr. Alexis Muston. London: Ingram, Cooke, and Co. 1863. died. He doth to the black calendar belong, Likewise, o' the Inquisition's murders wide And deep. Could blackest Hell itself their vileness hide? 95 The Martyrs of the Valleys, newly come, Filed off in order for the march. No peal Of trumpet summoned them, no pipe, nor drum, That rouseth men, on earth, to slaughterous zeal. The beckoning Hand of Light to advance, or wheel Guides them. And on they move—Italia's host Of Martyrs, on whom Rome set her strong heel, To crush out life: a dreadful holocaust To Evil! Nor is her zest for murder changed, or lost— 96 Though great Mazzini's life of labour served To kindle fire of freedom in the breast Of his “Young Italy”—and strongly nerved Some manly arms and hands to win a blest Victory for freedom; and the age-long pest Of Popery now hangs its head. Oh, no! Rome hath not changed. Nor ever will men rest Peacefully in Truth while she can work them woe. Of Freedom and of Truth she is the deadliest foe!— 97 I heard begin the tuneful swell of praise— Soon changed to prayer for Italy—as on The Martyr Army marched. But soon my gaze On their bright ranks grew dim; and faint the tone— And fainter—of their chaunt. Before the throne The martyrs soon will bow, in rapture high, I thought, as I awoke. But, not yet done Is my earth-labour. I must better try To live—“as ever in my great Taskmaster's eye.” EARLY PIECES. TO LINCOLN CATHEDRAL. Hail, awful pile! Child of Time's midnight age, Now Mother in its youth renewed! The tomb Of regal priests who banqueted on joys Wrung from the peasants' woes: disciples strange Of Him whose coat was woven without a seam Throughout, who had not where to lay His head! Great sepulchre of haughty gloom and grandeur— Bestriding earth, like as thy shrinëd dead, While living, did bestride the human mind— Thy veritable being, which thy frown Stamps on our consciousness so solemnly, Would seem, like shapes in fables of thy times, A phantom too unreal for our belief, Were we not witnesses that oft the mind, Disordered and oppressed by strong disease, Creates, in throes of thought, its images Of gorgeous dress and stature giantlike— Dwarfing the voluntary portraitures Sketched by Thought's pencil in the hours of health. Roman Ermine Street, 1829. WHAT ARE DREAMS? Are dreams a portion of our active life? Are they the living movements of the soul, Which grows more wakeful while the body sleeps; And, unrepressed by drear reality, Its playful vigil keeps, or weaves its web Of self-entangling sorrow—picturing, In deeper shades or wilder ecstasies, The joys or troubles of our waking hours? Or, are we merely passive in our sleep? Do ‘spiritual creatures’ visit us, And hold more ready converse with the mind— Unshackled, whiles, by life corporeal— Forewarning it, by emblematic signs, Of coming grief or pleasure?— We but know, As yet, in part; but, when eternity Shall dawn—when the strange noose is loosed Which ties the soul to matter—we shall know As we are known. The freed inhabitant Of this our mortal tenement, shall then Its own mysterious secrets learn; and, skilled Its past experience to trace, 'twill live, In thought, its life terrestrial o'er again. Yea, then, shall spiritual essences Be our companions in celestial bliss, Or, sharers, with us, of sin's penalties. And, if to speak of past acquaintanceship Be ours, with spirits perverse, how terrible That converse! But, if angels blest shall pour Their sweet communications in our ear, And tell of pleasing whispers to the soul In far departed hours of earthly sleep— How rapturous, to hail eternally In heaven, that brotherhood of spirits pure, Our secret visitants of love on earth! Gainsborough, 1830. LOVE'S CHALLENGE. What meant that glancing of thine eye, That softly hushed, yet struggling sigh? Hast thou a thought of woe or weal, Which breathed, my bosom would not feel? Why shouldst thou, then that thought conceal, Or hide it from my mind, Love? Didst thou e'er breathe a sigh to me, And I not breathe as deep to thee? Or hast thou whispered in mine ear A word of sorrow or of fear,— Or have I seen thee shed a tear,— And looked a thought unkind, Love? Did e'er a gleam of Love's sweet ray Across thy beaming countenance play,— Or joy its seriousness beguile, And o'er it cast a radiant smile,— And mine with kindred joy, the while, Not glow as bright as thine, Love? Why wouldst thou, then, that something seek To hide within thy breast,—nor speak, Its load of doubt, of grief, or fear, Of joy, or sorrow, to mine ear,— Assured this heart would gladly bear A burthen borne by thine, Love? Gainsborough, 1830. TO— Oh, cleave more closely to my breast, And I will closer cleave to thine: Thy bosom is my sweetest rest— Oh, rest thy weary head on mine! Let storms around us rudely beat, And on us pour the withering blast: If we the storm together meet, 'Twill sweeter be, when overpast. Let pleasures fade, and want assail— Yet nought of murmuring or of care, Within our bosom shall prevail— For Love shall whisper quiet there. Then cleave more closely to my breast, And I will closer cleave to thine: Thy bosom is my sweetest rest— Oh, rest thy weary head on mine! Gainsborough, 1830. SIR RAYMOND AND THE FALSE PALMER. Sir Raymond de Clifford, a gallant band Hath gathered to fight in the Holy Land; And his lady's heart is sinking in sorrow,— For the knight and his lances depart on the morrow! “Oh, wherefore, noble Raymond, tell,”— His lovely ladye weeping said,— “With lonely sorrow must I dwell, “When but three bridal moons have fled?” Sir Raymond kissed her pale, pale cheek, And strove, with a warrior's pride, While an answer of love he essayed to speak, His flooding tears to hide. But an image rose in his heated brain, That shook his heart with vengeful pain, And anger flashed in his rolling eye. While his ladye looked on him tremblingly. Yet he answered not in wrathful haste,— But clasped his bride to his manly breast; And with words of tender yet stately dress, Thus strove to banish her heart's distress:— “De Burgh hath enrolled him with Philip of France,— “Baron Hubert,—who challenged De Clifford's lance, “And made him the scoff of the burgher swine, “When he paid his vows at the Virgin's shrine. “Oh, ask me not, love, to tarry in shame,— “Lest ‘craven’ be added to Raymond's name! “To Palestine hastens my mortal foe,— “And I with our Lion's Heart will go! “Nay, Gertrude, repeat not thy sorrowing tale! “Behold in my casque the scallop-shell,— “And see on my shoulder the Holy Rood— “The pledge of my emprize—bedyed in blood! “Thou wouldst not, love, I should be forsworn, “Nor the stain on my honour be tamely borne: “Do thou to the saints, each passing day, “For Raymond and royal Richard pray,— “While they rush to the rescue, for God's dear Son; And soon, for thy Raymond, the conqueror's meed,— By the skill of this arm, and the strength of my steed,— “From the Paynim swart shall be nobly won. “Thou shalt not long for De Clifford mourn, “Ere he to thy bosom of love return; “When blind to the lure of the red-cross bright, “He will bask, for life, in thy beauty's light!” The morn in the radiant east arose:— The Red-cross Knight hath spurred his steed That courseth as swift as a falcon's speed:— To the salt-sea shore Sir Raymond goes. Soon, the sea he hath crossed, to Palestine; And there his heart doth chafe and pine,— For Hubert de Burgh is not in that land: He loitereth in France, with Philip's band. But De Clifford will never a recreant turn, While the knightly badge on his arm is borne; And long, beneath the Syrian sun, He fasted and fought, and glory won. His Gertrude, alas! like a widow pines; And though on her castle the bright sun shines, She sees not its beams,—but in loneliness prays, Through the live-long hours of her weeping days. Twelve moons have waned, and the morn is come When, a year before, from his meed-won home Sir Raymond went:—At the castle gate A reverend Palmer now doth wait. He saith he hath words for the ladye's ear; And he telleth, in accents dread and drear, Of De Clifford's death in the Holy Land, At Richard's side, by a Saracen's hand. And he gave to the ladye, when thus he had spoken,— Of Sir Raymond's fall a deathly token: 'Twas a lock of his hair all stained with blood, Entwined on a splinter of Holy Rood.— Then the Palmer in haste from the castle sped; And from gloomy morn to weary night, Lorn Gertrude, in her widowed plight, Weepeth and waileth the knightly dead.— Three moons have waned, and the Palmer, again, By Gertrude stands, and smileth fain; Nor of haste, nor of death, speaks the Palmer, now; Nor doth sadness or sorrow bedim his brow. He softly sits by the ladye's side, And vaunteth his deeds of chivalrous pride; Then lisps, in her secret ear, of things Which deeply endanger the thrones of kings: From Philip of France, he saith, he came, To treat with Prince John, whom she must not name; And he in fair France hath goodly lands,— Where his sturdy vassals await his commands.— The ladye liked her gallant guest,— For he kenned the themes that pleased her best; And his tongue in silken measures skilled, With goodly ditties her memory filled. Thus the Palmer the ladye's ear beguiles,— Till Gertrude her sorrow exchangeth for smiles; And when from the castle the Palmer went, She watched his return from the battlement.— Another moon doth swell and wane; But how slowly it waneth! How her heart now paineth For sight of the Palmer again! But the Palmer comes, and her lightsome heart Derideth pain and sorrow: She pledgeth the Palmer, and smirketh smart, And saith, “Wllss wed to-morrow!”— The morrow is come, and at break of day, 'Fore the altar, the abbot, in holy array, Is joining the Palmer's and Gertrude's hands,— But, in sudden amazement the holy man stands! For, before the castle, a trumpet's blast Rings so loud that the Palmer starts aghast; And, at Gertrude's side, he sinks dismayed,— Is't with dread of the living, or fear of the dead? The doors of the chapel were open thrown, And the beams through the pictured windown shone On the face of De Clifford, with fury flushed,— And forth on the Palmer he wildly rushed!— “False Hubert!” he cried; and his knightly sword Was sheathed in the heart of the fiend-sold lord!— With a scream of terror Gertrude fell— For she knew the pride of Sir Raymond well! He flew to raise her—but 'twas in vain: Her spirit its flight in fear had ta'en!— And Sir Raymond kneels that his soul be shriven, And the stain of this deed be by grace forgiven:— But ere the Abbot his grace can dole, De Clifford's truthful heart is breaking,— And his soul, also, its flight is taking!— Christ, speed it to a heavenly goal!— Oh, pray for the peace of Sir Raymond's soul! Gainsborough, 1832. THE GOSHERD OF CROYLAND. Tis a tale of merry Lincolnshire I've heard my grannam tell; And I'll tell it to you, my masters, here, An it likes you all, full well. A Gosherd on Croyland fen one day Awoke, in haste, from slumber; And on counting his geese, to his sad dismay, He found there lacked one of the number. O the Gosherd looked west, and he looked east, And he looked before and behind him; And his eye from north to south he cast For the gander—but couldn't find him! So the Gosherd he drave his geese to the cote, And began, forthwith, to wander Over the marish so wild and remote, In search for the old stray gander. O the Gosherd he wandered till twilight gray Was throwing its mists around him; But the gander seemed farther and farther astray— For the Gosherd had not yet found him. So the Gosherd, foredeeming his search in vain, Resolved no farther to wander; But to Croyland he turned him, in dudgeon, again Sore fretting at heart for the gander. Thus he footed the fens so dreary and dern, While his brain, like the sky, was darkening; And, with dread, to the scream of the startled hern And the bittern's boom, he was hearkening. But when the Gosherd the churchyard reached,— Forefearing the dead would be waking,— Like a craven upon the sward he stretched, And could travel no farther for quaking! And there the Gosherd lay through the night, Not daring to rise and go further: For, in sooth, the Gosherd beheld a sight That frighted him more than murther! From the old church clock the midnight hour In hollow tones was pealing, When a slim white ghost to the church porch door Seemed up the footpath stealing! Stark staring upon the sward lay the clown, And his heart went “pitter-patter,”— Till the ghost in the clay-cold grave sunk down,— When he felt in a twitter—twatter! Soon—stretching aloft its long white arms— From the grave the ghost was peeping!— Cried the Gosherd, “Our Lady defend me from harms, “And Saint Guthlacke have me in his keeping!” The white ghost hissed!—the Gosherd swooned! In the morn,—on the truth 'tis no slander,— Near the church porch door a new grave he found, And, therein, the white ghost—his stray gander! Lincoln, 1835. THE SWINEHERD OF STOW. I sing of a swineherd, in Lindsey, so bold, Who tendeth his flock in the wide forest-fold: He sheareth no wool from his snouted sheep: He soweth no corn, and none he doth reap; Yet the swineherd no lack of good living doth know Come jollily trowl The brown round bowl, Like the jovial swineherd of Stow! He hedgeth no meadows to fatten his swine: He renteth no joist for his snorting kine: They rove through the forest, and browse on the mast,— Yet, he lifteth his horn, and bloweth a blast, And they come at his call, blow he high, blow he low!— Come, jollily trowl The brown round bowl, And drink to the swineherd of Stow! He shunneth the heat 'mong the fern-stalks green,— Or dreameth of elves 'neath the forest treen: He wrappeth him up when the oak leaves sere And the acorns fall, at the wane of the year; And he tippleth at Yule, by the log's cheery glow.— Come, jollily trowl The brown round bowl, And pledge the bold swineherd of Stow! The bishop he passeth the swineherd in scorn, — Yet, to mass wends the swineherd at Candlemas morn: And he offereth his horn, at our Lady's hymn, With bright silver pennies filled up to the brim: — Saith the bishop, “A very good fellow, I trow!”— Come, jollily trowl The brown round bowl, And honour the swineherd of Stow! And now the brave swineherd, in stone, ye may spy, Holding his horn, on the Minster so high! — But the swineherd he laugheth, and cracketh his joke, With his pig-boys that vittle beneath the old oak, — Saying, “Had I no pennies, they'd make me no show!” — Come, jollily trowl The brown round bowl, And laugh with the swineherd of Stow! Lincoln, 1835. THE DAUGHTER OF PLANTAGENET. FYTTE THE FYRSTE. 'Tis midnight, and the broad full moon Pours on the earth her silver noon; Sheeted in white, like spectres of fear, Their ghostly forms the towers uprear; And their long dark shadows behind them are cast, Like the frown of the cloud when the lightning hath past. The warder sleeps on the battlement, And there is not a breeze to curl the Trent; The leaf is at rest, and the owl is mute— But list! awaked is the woodland lute: The nightingale warbles her omen sweet Onthe hour when the ladye her lover shall meet. She waves her hand from the loophole high, And watcheth, with many a struggling sigh, And hearkeneth in doubt, and paleth with fear, — Yet tremblingly trusts her true knight is near; — And there skims o'er the river—or doth her heart doat? — As with wing of the night-hawk—her lover's brave boat. His noble form hath attained the strand, And she waves again her small white hand; And breathing to heaven, in haste, a prayer, Softly glides down the lonely stair; And there stands by the portal, all watchful and still, Her own faithful damsel awaiting her will. The midnight lamp gleams dull and pale, — The maidens twain are weak and frail, — But Love doth aid his votaries true, While they the massive bolts undo, — And a moment hath flown, and the warrior knight Embraceth his love in the meek moonlight. The knight his love-prayer, tenderly, Thus breathed in his fair one's ear “Oh! wilt thou not, my Agnes, flee? — “And, quelling thy maiden fear, “Away in the fleeting skiff with me, “And, for aye, this lone heart cheer?” “O let not bold Romara seek”— Soft answered his ladye-love, — “A father's doating heart to break, “For should I disdainful prove “Of his high behests, his darling child “Will thenceforth be counted a thing defiled; “And the kindling eye of my martial sire “Be robbed of its pride, and be quenched its fire: “Nor long would true Romara deem “The heart of his Agnes beat for him, “And for him alone—if that heart, he knew, “To its holiest law could be thus untrue.” His plume-crowned helm the warrior bows Low o'er her shoulder fair, And bursting sighs the grief disclose His lips can not declare; And swiftly glide the tears of love Adown the ladye's cheek; — Their deep commingling sorrows prove The love they cannot speak! The moon shines on them, as on things She loves to robe with gladness, — But all her light no radiance brings Unto their hearts' dark sadness: Forlornly, 'neath her cheerless ray, — Bosom to bosom beating, — In speechless agony they stay, With burning kisses greeting; — Nor reck they with what speed doth haste The present hour to join the past. “Ho! lady Agnes, lady dear!” Her fearful damsel cries; “You reckon not, I deeply fear, “How swift the moontide flies! “The surly warder will awake, “The morning dawn, anon,— “My heart beginneth sore to quake,— “I fear we are undone!” But Love is mightier far, than Fear: The ladye hasteth not: The magnet of her heart is near, And peril is forgot! She clingeth to her knight's brave breast Like a lorn turtle-dove, And 'mid the peril feeleth rest, — The full, rapt rest of Love! “I charge thee, hie thee hence, sir knight!” The damsel shrilly cries; “If this should meet her father's sight, “By Heaven! my lady dies.” The warrior rouseth all his pride, And looseth his love's caress, — Yet slowness of heart doth his strength betide As he looks on her loveliness: — But again the damsel their love-dream breaks, — And self-reproachingly, The knight his resolve of its fetters shakes, And his spirit now standeth free. Then, came the last, absorbing kiss, True Love can ne'er forego, — That dreamy plenitude of bliss Or antepast of woe, — That seeming child of Heaven, which at its birth Briefly expires, and proves itself of earth. The ladye hieth to her couch; — And when the morn appears, The changes of her cheek avouch, Full virginly her fears; — But her doating father can nought discern In the hues of the rose and the lily that chase Each other across her lovely face, — Save a sweetness that softens his visage stern. FYTTE THE SECONDE. Romara's skiff is on the Trent, And the stream is in its strength, — For a surge, from its ocean-fountain sent, Pervades its giant length: Roars the hoarse heygre in its course, Lashing the banks with its wrathful force; And dolefully echoes the wild-fowl's scream, As the sallows are swept by the whelming stream And her callow young are hurled for a meal, To the gorge of the barbel, the pike, and the eel: The porpoise heaves 'mid the rolling tide, And, snorting in mirth, doth merrily ride, — For he hath forsaken his bed in the sea, To sup on the salmon, right daintily! In Romara's breast a tempest raves: He heeds not the rage of the furrowy waves: Supremely his hopes and fears are set On the image of Agnes Plantagenet: And though from his vision fade Gainsburgh's towers, And the moon is beclouded, and darkness lours Yet the eye of his passion oft pierceth the gloom, And beholds his Beloved in her virgin bloom— Kneeling before the holy Rood, — All clasped her hands, — Beseeching the saints and angels good That their watchful bands Her knight may preserve from a watery tomb! What deathful scream rends Romara's heart? — Is it the bittern that, flapping the air, Doth shriek in madness, and downward dart, As if from the bosom of Death she would tear Her perished brood, —or a shroud would have By their side, in the depths of their river-grave? Hark! hark! again! —'tis a human cry, Like the shriek of a man about to die! And its desolateness doth fearfully pierce The billowy boom of the torrent fierce; And, swift as a thought Glides the warrior's boat Through the foaming surge to the river's bank, Where, lo! —by a branch of the osiers dank, Clingeth one in agony Uttering that doleful cry; His silvery head of age upborne Appeared above the wave; So nearly was his strength outworn, That all too late to save Had been the knight, if another billow Its force on his fainting frame had bent, — Nay, his feeble grasp by the drooping willow The beat of a pulse might have fatally spent. With eager pounce did Romara take From the yawning wave its prey,— But nought to his deliverer spake The man with the head of gray: And the warrior stripped, with needful haste, The helpless one of his drenchëd vest, And wrapt his own warm mantle round The chill one in his deathly swound. The sea-born strength of the stream is spent, And Romara's boat outstrips its speed, — For his stalwart arm to the oar is bent, And swiftly the ebbing waves recede. Divinely streaketh the morning-star With a wavy light the rippling waters; And the moon looks on from the west, afar, And palely smiles, with her waning daughters, The thin-strown stars, which their vigil keep Till the orient sun shall awake from sleep. The sun hath awoke: and in garments of gold The turrets of Torksey are livingly rolled; Afar, on Trent's margin, the flowery lea Exhales her dewy fragrancy; And gaily carols the matin lark, As the warrior hastes to moor his bark. Two menials hasten to the beach, For signal none need they; On the towers they kept a heedful watch As the skiff glode on its way: With silent step and breathless care The rescued one they softly bear, And bring him, at their lord's behest, To a couch of silken pillowed rest. The serfs could scarce avert their eye From his manly form and mien, As, with closed lids, all reverendly, He lay in peace, serene. And Romara thought, as he gazing leant O'er the slumberer's form, that so pure a trace Of the spirit of Heaven with the earthly blent Dwelt only there, and in Agnes' face. The leech comes forth at the hour of noon, And saith, that the sick from his deathly swoon Will awake anon; and Romara's eye, Uplift, betokens his heartfelt joy; And again o'er the slumberer's couch he bows Till, slowly, those peaceful lids unclose,— When, long, with heavenward-fixëd gaze, With lowly prayer and grateful praise, The aged man, from death reprieved, His bosom of its joy relieved. — Then did Romara thus address His gray guest in his reverendness: “Now, man of prayer, come tell to me “Some spell of thy holy mystery! “Some vision hast had of the Virgin bright, — “Or message, conveyed from the world of light, “By the angels of love who in purity stand “'Fore the throne of our Lord in the heavenly land? “I hope, when I die, to see them there; “For I love the angels so holy and fair: “And often, I trust, my prayer they greet “With smiles, when I kneel and kiss their feet “In the missal, my mother her weeping child gave, “But a day or two ere she was laid in the grave. “Sage man of prayer, come tell to me “What holy shapes in sleep they see “Who love the blest saints and serve them well! “I pray thee, sage man, to Romara tell, “For a guerdon, thy dreams,—sith, to me thou hast said “No thanks that I rescued thy soul from the dead.” But, when the aged man arose And met Romara's wistful eye, — What accents shall the change disclose That marked his visage, fearfully? — From joy to grief and deepest dole, From radiant hope to dark presage Of future ills beyond control — Hath passed the visage of the sage. “Son of an honoured line, I grieve,” Outspake the reverend seer, “That I no guerdon thee can give “But words of woe and fear!— “Thy sun is setting! —and thy race, “In thee, their goodly heir, “Shall perish, nor a feeble trace “Their fated name declare! — “Thy love is fatal: fatal, too, “This act of rescue brave— “For, him who from destruction drew “My life, no arm can save!” He said, —and took his lonely way Far from Romara's towers. — His fateful end from that sad day O'er Torksey's chieftain lowers: Yet, vainly, in his heart a shrine Hope builds for love —with faith; — Alas! for him with frown malign Waiteth the grim king Death! FYTTE THE THYRDE. Plantagenet hath dungeons deep Beneath his castled halls; — Plantagenet awakes from sleep To count his dungeoned thralls. Alone, with the torch of blood-red flame, The man of blood descends; And the fettered captives curse his name, As through the vaults he wends. — His caverns are visited all save one, The deepest, and direst in gloom, — Where his father, doomed by a demon son, Abode in a living tomb. — “I bring thee bread and water, sire! “Brave usury for thy gold! “I fear my filial zeal will tire “To visit, soon, thy hold!” Thus spake the fiendish-hearted lord, And wildly laughed, in scorn: Like thunder round the cell each word By echoing fiends is borne, — But not a human heart is there The baron's scorn or hate to fear! And the captives tell, as he passeth again, — That tyrant, in his rage, — How an angel hath led the aged man To his heavenly heritage! The wrathful baron little recked That angel was his darling child; Or knew his dark ambition checked By her who oft his rage beguiled, — By her on whom he ever smiled: — This had he known, from that dread hour, His darling's smile had lost its power, — And his own hand, without remorse, Had laid her at his feet a corse! — Plantagenet's banners in pride are borne To the sound of pipe and drum! And his mailëd bands, with the dawn of morn, To Romara's walls are come. “We come not as foes,” the herald saith, — “But we bring Plantagenet's shriven faith “That thou, Romara, in thine arms “Shalt soon enfold thy true love's charms: “Let no delay thy joy betide! — “Thy Agnes soon shall be thy bride!” The raven croaks as Torksey's lord Attends that bannered host; But the lover is deaf to the omen-bird — The fatal moat is crossed! “Ride, ride!” saith the baron, — thy ladye fain “And the priest —by the altar wait!” And the spearmen seize his bridle-rein, And hurry him to his fate. “A marriage by torchlight!” the baron said; “This stair to the altar leads! “We patter our prayers, 'mong the mouldering dead, — “And there we tell our beads!” Along the caverned dungeon's gloom The tyrant strides in haste; And, powerless, to his dreadful doom The victim followeth fast. The dazeëd captives quake and stare At the sullen torch's blood-red glare, And the lover starts aghast At the deathlike forms they wear! Too late, the truth upon him breaks! — Romara's heart is faint! — “Behold thy bride!”the baron shrieks— “Wilt hear the wedding chaunt? “This chain once bound my father here, “Who would have found his grave— “The cursëd dotard! —'neath the wave, — “Had not thy hateful hand been near. — “Be this the bride thou now shalt wed! “This dungeon dank thy bridal bed! — “And when thy youthful blood shall freeze “In death, —may fiends thy spirit seize!” Plantagenet hath minions fell Who do their master's bidding well: — Few days Romara pines in dread: — His soul is with the sainted dead! — Plantagenet hath reached his bourne! What terrors meet his soul forlorn And full of stain, —I may not say: — Reveal them shall the Judgment Day! — Her orisons at matin hour, At noon, and eve, and midnight toll, For him, doth tearful Agnes pour! — Jesu, Maria! sain his soul!
