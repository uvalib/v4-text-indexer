      <field name="fulltext">[I. Praise the Lord] O praise the Lord Vers: O praise the Lord, for it is a good thing to sing prayses to sing prayses vnto our God, yee a ioyfull and pleasant thing it is to bee thankfull, yee and pleasant thing it is to bee thankfull. Cho: O let your songs be of him and praise him, And let your talking, And be of all his wondrous works, wondrous works, be of all, of all his wondrous works. Vers: Prayse the Lord O my soule, O my Soule And forget not all his benefits which forgiuest All thy sinnes, all And healeth all thy Infirmities. Cho: And gathereth thee, out of the land, from the East and from the West, from the North and from the South. And saueth thy life. from destruction, And crowneth thee with mercie, louing kindnesse, and louing kindnesse. Vers: O praise the Lord, yee Angels of his yee that excell in strength yee that fulfill fulfill his commandements, commandements, And hearken vnto the voice of his word, and hearken vnto the voice of his word. Chor: O speake good of the Lord, of the Lord, All yee workes of his, In all places, In of his Dominions, in all places of his Dominions, praise thou the Lord, whilst I liue will I praise, whilst will I praise the Lord, O my Soule whilst I liue will I praise the Lord. [II. Hither we come] Hither we come into this world of wo Hither we come into this world of wo, And feeling to what end we come wee crie, wee crie, And wee crie, And wee crie, I'the morning of our age, like flowers we blow, wee blow, And like Gods figures seeme too good to die, But let afflictions touch vs, and like clay, wee fall to what we are, wee fall to what we are, and end the day, [III. He that loues] Hee that Loues Hee that Loues. Cho: As olde Time makes these decay, So his flames must waste away. But a smoth. Cho: Where these are not I despise, Louely cheekes or lips or eyes. [IIII. Sleepe all my ioyes] Sleepe all my ioyes Sleepe all my ioyes. Cho: All though shees dead, yet this from death, from death shee said, I alwayes liu'd and dyed a perfect maide. [V. Who hath a human Soule] Who hath a human Soule Who hath a human Soule, and musicke hates, hates his owne Soule, thats made hermoniously thats made thats made thats made hermoniously, Then they are Diuels or right reprobates. To hate that without which mens spirits should die, for if the ioyes of heauen, be much in this, bee much in this, Let him to Hell to howle that hates this blisse, Let him to hell to howle that hates this blisse, that hates this blisse. [VI. Sitting once] Sitting once rapt with delight Sitting once rapt with delight, in my fayrest mistris sight, I tooke pleasure to compare, her eyes witnesse to the ayre, That which compast in the Ball, I did purest water call, I did purest water call, And the prettie, prettie inward round, I stil'd earth but oh, I found while some part I did desire, did desire for to liken vnto fire, ere I knew from whence it came, I my selfe grew all a flame, I my selfe grew all a flame. [VII. Tis but a frowne] Tis but a frowne Tis but a frowne, I prethee, prethee let me dye, on bended brow Concludes my Tragedie, for all my loue I craue but this of thee, thou wilt not bee to long in killing mee, If that you loue not what auailes your smiles, you onely warme a ball of Snow the whilst, which whilst it gathers comfort from your eyes, with that same comfort melts away dies, with that same comfort melts away and dyes, Thus in the ende your smiles your frownes are one. And differ but in execution, and differs differs but in execution. [VIII. Looke on me euer] Looke on me euer Looke on me euer. If by so happie happy meanes I dye, my fortune it aduances, aduances. And if by chance a teare you shed, to shew my death did moue you, It will reuiue me. reuiue me being dead, being dead and I againe shall loue you, Redeeme mee from so deepe so deepe dispaire, so deepe dispaire, the power you haue now trie it, think me but faire and I am faire although the world denie it. [IX. Tell me you starres] Tell me you starres that our affections mooue Tell me you starres that our affections mooue, why made you mee, that cruell on too loue, why burnes my heart, her scorned sacrifice whose brest is hard as Christall, cold as Ice, God of desire if all thy votaries thou thus repay, Succession will grow wise, no sighes for Incence at thy shrine shall smoake, thy rights shall be despise'd thy Altars brooke, O, O, or giue her my flame, to melt that Snow that yet vnthaw'd does on her bosome grow, or make me Ice, And with her Christal, Christall Chaines, bind vp all loue within my frozen vaines, bind vp all loue within my frozen vaines. [X. Olde Poets] Olde Poets that in Cupids hand put weapons first Olde Poets that in Cupids hand put weapons first. Two shafts, In all her parts. Ten thousand fetters flames and darts. The graces and the carelesse snares, that in her looser, looser beautie lyes, and sweeter Ayres that flye like lightning from her lips, sweete smiles, And sweeter Ayres that flye like lightning from her lips, Tell mee how many wayes loue murders men, Tell mee how many wayes loue murders men. [XI. Thus sung Orpheus] Thus sung Orpheus to his strings Thus sung Orpheus to his strings, when hee was all most slaine, whilst the winds soft murmuring, Answer'd all his woes againe, Answer'd againe, Euridice he cried, Ah, Ah, Ah deare Euridice and so he died. Ah deare Euridice, Ah, the Eccoing winds reply'd, the Eccoing winds reply'd, Ah, Ah deare Euridice, the Eccoing winds reply'd, Ah deare Euridice, the Eccoing winds reply'd, Ah, Ah deare Euridice, Ah deare Euridice, the Eccoing winds reply'd, reply'd. XII. [When first I saw thee thou dist sweetely play] When first I saw thee thou dist sweetely play The gentle thiefe, and stol'st my heart away, Rend'rt againe or else send mee thine owne, Two is too much for thee when I haue none, Which if thou dost not I will sweare thou art, A sweete fac't creature, with a double double heart. Yet pardon faire on, I did freely giue, To thee my heart, and yet without it liue. By powerfull flames, shot from thy conquering eye. To thee sweete Mansion let it euer flye, And though I am, of my poore heart bereft. 'T may prooue a happie Vnion, not a Theft. XIIII. [Since all things loue, why should not we] Since all things loue, why should not we, The best of creatures bee as free, The Pearle eyd fish in euerie water Pursues his loue being taught by nature, The seely worme the Lambe and harmelesse Doue, Which knoweth nothing, yet knowes how to loue. All sencelesse things loues passions feele, The stone attrackes th'vnyeelding steele. The Iuin twines on euerie tree, And loues it more then you loue mee. And in the cold of Winter fresh is seene, For heat of loue is it that keepes it greene. Then learne by seeing what they doe, If they want eyes, hands, tongues yet woe. Can you that haue of each the best, Apt for that vse yet vse them least, T'ware sin to thinke the world did neare yet show, So vnkind a brest grac't with so mild a brow. The lasse that lou'd the Idean swane, Thought it not base nor found it vaine. Adone was lou'd though proud and coye. Endimion to that drowsie boye, Whom for to please such care faire Cinthia tooke, That euer since that time she pale doth looke. Then let vs loue whilst we are in youth, You fraught with beautie, I with truth. Weel' make the world being in our prime, Wrinckled with enuie more then time, And when too old to liue yee fate draws nigh, Our loue shall make vs too to young to die. [XV. Farewell] Farewell once my delight Farewell once my delight, farewell the nerest part of my hart, of the world the dearest, Ill plaine no more to loue, no more to thee, but seace to mourne, where none will pittie mee. And though I hat my life since you hat me And though I hat my life since you hat me. Ill couer it, to hid your crueltie, and since my loue and me you disauou, as if to loue you were to Iniure you. Ill mildly temporize, with my vnrest and flye, flye the face I carie, carie in my brest, Nor farther seeke this onely shall suffice me my loue deseru'd you, though you did despise mee. Farewell and may you euer be, good as you are though neere so bad so bad to me, bee you belou'd of all, and lastly shine, as faire in Heauens eye, As you are in mine. [XVI. Come louers all] Come louers all to mee And cease your mourning Come louers all to mee And cease your mourning, cease your mourning loue has no shafts to shoote no more brands burning, no more brands burning, hee meanes my paines shall you from paines deliuer. Shall you from paines deliuer, for in my brest h'has empted all his quiuer, Had he not beene a child, he would haue knowne, h'has lost a thousand thousand seruants to kill on, Thousand seruants to kill on, to kill on. [XVII. In Celias face] In Celias face a question did a rise In Celias face a question did a rise, which were more beautifull, her lips or eyes. Then weept the eyes, from their springs did powre of liquid oriental pearle, liquid orientall pearle a showre, where at the lips mooud with delight and pleasure, through a sweete smile vnlockt their pearly treasure, and bad loue Judge, whither did ad more grace weeping or smiling pearles to Celias face, wher at the lippes mooud with delight and pleasure, through a sweete smile vnlockt their pearly treasure. And bad loue iudge, whether did adde, did adde more grace, weeping or smiling pearles to Celias face. [XVIII. Tell me where] Is shee faire Is shee faire, Beautie doth from liking grow, whats that beautie if neglected, seene of all of none respected, Then let my Mistresse that I loue her, Thinke her faire, Thinke her faire cause I approoue her. [XX. Hayle Cloris hayle] Hayle Cloris hayle Hayle Cloris hayle, faire goddesse of the spring, youth of the yeare of thee still will we sing, of thee still will we sing, of thee still will wee sing. Fresh Queene of Lakes of lawnes and bowers nurse of new loues, And of new flowers, nurse of new loues and of new flow'rs, Hayle fairest of Ioues seede, hayle fayrest of Ioues seede, onely of thee, onely of thee, that art earths musicke shall our musicke bee, musicke bee, our musicke bee. [XXI. Th'ecco] Th' ecco, the wandring winds that throw through the ayre Th' ecco, the wandring winds that throw through the ayre, The wandring winds that throw through the ayre, the wandring winds that throw through the ayre, lifes soueraigne balsome as they blow, shall with the lawdes, And zeale begetting layes breath'd by vs hourely in thy prayes, feast the ayre breath'd feast the ayre, feast the ayre, And teach the hils rocks and woods to sing, Hayle Cloris hayle, fayre goddesse of the spring. [XXII. Young Thirsis lay] Young Thirsis lay, In Phillis lap and gazing on Young Thirsis lay, In Phillis lap and gazing on, And her eye, steem'd life too meane to meane for such good hap, And faine the boye would dye, when Phillis who the force did proue of loue as wel as he, Cryd, cryd to him stay a while my loue and I will dye with thee, so did these happie happie louers dye, Happie louers dye, But with so little little paine, that both to life Immediately, returnd to dye againe, to dye againe, returnd to dye to dye againe. [XXV. I saw faire Cloris] I saw faire Cloris walke alone I saw faire Cloris walke alone, whilst feathred raine, came softly done, and Ioue descended from his Tower, to Court her in a siluer shower, To Court her in a siluer shower. The wanton Snow flew on her brest, like little birds vnto their nest, but ouer come, with whitnesse there for griefe it thawed, it thaw'd in to a teare, in to a teare. Thence falling on her garments hem, to decke her, to decke her, froze into a gem, to decke her, froze into a gem. [XXVI. Death their is no neede] Death their is no neede of thee Death their is no neede of thee, death no need of thee, of thee, Death And constancie, Are enough without thy dart Ar Are to tire vppon an honest heart. And with it selfe, it selfe rewards. And oft in seeking it is found, and it is found glorie that liues glory, that liues, when we are vnder ground, glorie that liues when we are vnder ground, glorie that liues when wee are vnder ground. [XXVII. Like the rash and giddie giddie Flie] Like the rash and giddie giddie Flie Like the rash and giddie giddie Flie, fluttering abour her eyes I dye, fluttering about her eyes I dye, yet differs this, shee burnes away, she burnes away, only by night by night I night and day, shee burnes, only when she brings, she burns, bring neere vnto the flame her wings, but my Sunburnes euerie euerie where, euerie where at home. And neere shee knowes not that the fire consumes, consumes but I, foresee my death foresee foresee my death, foresee my death, and like, and like a desperat dye. An Elogie on the Right Honourable Lady, the Lady Arrabella Steward. Wake sorrow wake Wake sorrow wake, sith shee is falne a sleepe, she is falne a sleepe, A sleepe in death, who was Entombt who was Entombt in life. Eyes weepe out sight, or see but still to weepe, and weepe for losse of a most constant wife, who now is dead. Aye mee shees dead, Aye me shees dead, Then mind we still her name, name still her name, with hearts of lead. Arbella, farewell deare widdow wife farewell in death, that fardst so ill so ill in life, that fardst so ill in life, so ill in life, sole Parragon, for grace and Princely parts, thy vault still keepes our thoughts thy chest our hearts, thy vault still keepes our thoughts thy chest our hearts. FINIS.</field>
