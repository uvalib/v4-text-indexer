      <field name="fulltext">TO CHLOE, WITH THE Voyage to the Island of Love. Chloe the following Piece peruse with Care, It of a most delicious Country treats; Nor is it difficult to travel there; You may the Voyage make between the Sheets. [This charming Isle, which ravishes the Sight] The attribution of this poem is questionable.This charming Isle, which ravishes the Sight, Is sacred to the God of soft Desires; Who to all Mankind's Homage claims a Right, And ev'ry Breast inflames with am'rous Fires. None 'scape his Pow'r, all feel the tingling Dart, The Young, the Old, the Monarch, and the Slave: Who is exempt therefrom that has a Heart, The Weak, the Strong, the Coward, or the Brave? Once in their Lives here all a Visit make, And quit their Home to see this happy Isle; Here their most ardent Wishes Center take, Dependent on the Fair One's Frown or Smile, Ten Thousand different Ways you here may land, No Wind's amiss to bring you into Port; No Chains, no Guards, to bar the Entrance stand, All Sides lie open for a free Resort. Th'Agreeables, the Beauties, Graces, Charms, Have all the Ports committed to their Care; And making use of Love resistless Arms, Let fly at all, and not a Heart they spare. [Here the still Ocean quiet flows] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Here the still Ocean quiet flows, As the least Chrystal purling Streams; No Wind but the soft Zephyr blows, And o'er the level Surface skims; Whose pleasing Murmurs whilst you hear, In sporting with the wanton Seas; That Nature's Self did sleep you'd swear, And therefore left the World at Peace. A thousand Flowers along the Shore, The Pink, the Lilly, and the Rose, With Pleasure vye their beauteous Store, Yet the least Wonders there disclose. [Love, with his Darts does ev'ry Mortal wound] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Love, with his Darts does ev'ry Mortal wound, And as he's the most powerful of Kings, That on Earth, in Sea, or in Heav'n is found, By various Means all in Subjection brings: Thus 'tis that he, to aggravate the Pains, Of those who insolent his Pow'r deride, Makes them of worthless Objects wear the Chains, And tremble at that God they once defy'd. [For all the various Charms, that can adorn] The attribution of this poem is questionable.For all the various Charms, that can adorn A blooming Virgin, in her Person met; A Milk-white Skin, Cheeks rosy as the Morn, A Mouth with even Rows of Ivory set; Lips Coral Red, and suing to be press'd, Eyes that would stir an Anchoret's Desire; A Faultless Shape, imagine all the Rest, Then say, who would not at her Feet expire? [Ye Mortals, who, inflam'd with am'rous Fires] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Ye Mortals, who, inflam'd with am'rous Fires, Would of this Life the choicest Pleasures prove; Come to our Isle, and there have your Desires, There is no solid Pleasure without Love. [Go giddy Heads, those real Pleasures taste]The attribution of this poem is questionable.Go giddy Heads, those real Pleasures taste, Which in Love's Vanities are to be found; You'll tell your Thoughts thereof, when once they're past, If e'er you 'scape from that inchanted Ground. [Soon as one lands, a Goddess charming fair] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Soon as one lands, a Goddess charming fair, The Mistress of the Prudent and Discreet, Reason, whose Eyes so bright and piercing are, Obstructs our passing on, and crys, Retreat. But oh! the dazzled Sense denies its Aid, And hides her beauteous Features from our Eyes; 'Till lest amidst her Foes, the charming Maid, Finds that no Man in Love was ever wise. [He whom you there behold with Looks severe] The attribution of this poem is questionable.He whom you there behold with Looks severe, Is call'd Respect, and is the Child of Love; Got on Esteem; great is his Credit here, Him therefore court, if you'd successful prove; They who neglect to follow his Advice, Are very seldom Fav'rites with the Fair, To buy his Friendship, Silence is the Price, And even the Language of the Eyes forbear: She who so constant on his Steps does wait, Is call'd Precaution, circumspect, and wise, Of discreet Love, th'inseparable Mate, In Love one must have every Way one's Eyes. [My Words disjointed are, and wild] The attribution of this poem is questionable.My Words disjointed are, and wild, Continual Sighs break off my Speech; I'm of my Liberty beguil'd, And Reason's Aid in vain beseech. Has not Zelinda, charming Queen, Bound my Heart Captive in her Chains? E'er I her beauteous Face had seen, I never felt such cruel Pains. [There one may tender Lovers see] The attribution of this poem is questionable.There one may tender Lovers see, In Crowds flock thither every Day; Near th'Object of their Vows to be, And with them sport the Time away: There ev'ry House is deck'd with Flow'rs, All seems magnificent and gay; In Feasts and Balls they spend the Hours, And Care and Sorrow put away. All Vice is likewise banish'd thence, Nor suffered in this blest Retreat; E'en Misers lavish there their Pence, Bless'd if therewith a Smile they get. Nay, the most froward Mortals strive, Themselves agreeable to make; And the most stupid Sotts alive, Learn Wit, and off their Folly shake. The Pensive too, no longer dumb, Finds there a Tongue, and talks with Ease; In short there's none who thither come, But study all they can to please. [Methought, I saw my charming Dear] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Methought, I saw my charming Dear, Within my Arms expiring lye; But she reviv'd more killing Fair, So sweet the Death was she did dye. Methought I saw a While o'ercast, The wonted Lustre of her Eyes, 'Till languishing she sunk at last Upon my Breast in Extasies. But on my waking I perceiv'd, 'Twas all a fleeting Dream, no more; And griev'd, in Sleep, to be deceiv'd, To wake more wretched than before. [Fair Promises she always makes] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Fair Promises she always makes, Which Promises full oft she breaks; In Love to persevere decoys, And buoys us up with promis'd Joys; Nay, often bids those Wretches live, Who the next Hour their Doom receive. [Time and Respect o'ercome all Obstacles] The attribution of this poem is questionable. Time and Respect o'ercome all Obstacles: And Love, unshaken, may do Miracles. 'Tis great and glorious, sure, she cry'd, T'abase a haughty Beauty's Pride; And when you make th'Attempt in vain, 'Tis great, by Death, to end your Pain. You all may hope for, from your prudent Love, And the Fair, one Day, will your Flames approve. [What! always sigh, and bear eternal Pains!] The attribution of this poem is questionable.What! always sigh, and bear eternal Pains! Always love on, and wear a Tyrant's Chains! Perhaps too dye at last, and yet not dare, At the last Gasp, one's Suff'rings to declare! Or know, when a poor Wretch expiring lies, If she, who caus'd his Death, will with him sympathize? Must one, to happy be, the Venture run, Whether the cruel Fair, e'er Life be gone, Laying aside her Haughtiness, will deign To take some Pity, and to end his Pain; And not consider it may be too late, And Culprit first may have resign'd to Fate! [In close Retirement lives each Family] The attribution of this poem is questionable.In close Retirement lives each Family, And all is done with th'utmost Privacy; No Balls, or Serenades alarm the Ear, Nor i'th' Streets any, but at Night appear: All Persons there, their own Affairs attend, Without intrusting Confidant, or Friend: There Lovers seldom meet, but keep away, Forc'd a Constraint on their Desires to lay; There they must suffer, yet not dare complain, Tho' then oppress'd, with the most cruel Pain. This is the School where Lovers learn to try, The soft persuasive Language of the Eye; That silent Language, which so well imparts The inmost Thoughts, and Wishes of our Hearts; Which, without speaking, can the Mind explain, And tell us all its Joy, and all its Pain. [With falling Tears my Cheeks I stain'd] The attribution of this poem is questionable.With falling Tears my Cheeks I stain'd, With Grief and Anguish worn away, 'Till but a Skeleton remain'd, Of Strephon, once so blithe and gay: Yet I ne'er let Zelinda hear My Groans, or in the least complain, But waited with Respect and Fear, 'Till she, or Death, should end my Pain. [Her Name is Cruelty, Love's deadly Foe] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Her Name is Cruelty, Love's deadly Foe, Whose sole Delight's in Misery and Woe; A hideous Monster, dreadful to the Sight, From whom, one single Look, the boldest would affright. Yet is she join'd, so 'tis decreed by Fate, To Youth, and Beauty, as their constant Mate. [From Lovers Eyes, this Torrent takes its Source] The attribution of this poem is questionable.From Lovers Eyes, this Torrent takes its Source, Whose streaming Tears, its rapid Channel fill; And down the Rock precipitates its Course, Whilst, with its Fall, resounds each neighb'ring Hill. Its flowing Streams soften the hardest Stone; Its plaintive Murmurs fill the Woods around, Stern Cruelty remains unmov'd alone, Whilst Trees and Rocks, are melted with the Sound. [Alas! Zelinda, cruel and severe] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Alas! Zelinda, cruel and severe, Won't Death, or least, draw from your Eyes a Tear? These Woods, and Rocks, are soften'd with my Grief, And had they Pow'r, would give me some Relief; But you, Zelinda, cruel, beauteous Fair, Cause all my Woes, yet leave me to despair. [Despair's dire Lake, where Nymphs and Swains forlorn] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Despair's dire Lake, where Nymphs and Swains forlorn, Cease to be Objects of their Victor's Scorn; Hopeless to be belov'd, worn out with Pain, And having languish'd Months and Years in vain, Finding their Loves inexorable quite, And listless without them to bear the Light, Thither they come, resolv'd to end the Strife, And put an End at once to Love and Life. Birds of ill Omen hover in the Air, And by their croaking Noise inspire Despair; Whilst Thousands of wild Swans a Consort make, And sing their mournful Dirges on the Lake; Whose plaintive Harmony, and dying Strains, Seem to lament th'expiring Lovers Pains. [Alas! she seem'd to say, unhappy Swain!] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Alas! she seem'd to say, unhappy Swain! How do I pity all thy Grief and Pain? Thy tender Passion, and thy ardent Love, Deserv'd not that thy Fair should cruel prove. [Strephon, at length, thy Passion I approve] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Strephon, at length, thy Passion I approve, Thank Pity here, the beauteous Child of Love; Her Words have forc'd their Passage to my Breast, And me with tender Thoughts of thee possessed; Live then, I give thee Leave, fond Strephon, live, And with this pleasing Hope thy heart revive; That with thy Passion won, I shall, one Day, With endless Love thy Constancy repay. [Rejoice, my Heart, Zelinda is appeas'd] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Rejoice, my Heart, Zelinda is appeas'd, No longer think then on thy Suff'rings past; But prize that Life wherewith she's not displeas'd, And think what Joys may crown it at the last. When on the dreadful Brink of Death thou stood'st, Her beauteous Hand up-rais'd thee from the Grave; In common Justice then, my Heart, thou shoud'st Devote to her that Life which she did save. [What Pleasures past expressing I possest!] The attribution of this poem is questionable.What Pleasures past expressing I possest! How was my Soul with rapt'rous Transports blest! How sweetly had I past Life's irksome Stage, Free from those Passions that within me rage; Had my Desires but Moderation known, And I contented press'd no farther on! I met Zelinda wheresoe'er I went, And spoke my Mind to her without Restraint; [Strephon, farewell, I dare no longer stay] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Strephon, farewell, I dare no longer stay, Duty against my Will drags me away: Yet live, however, better Days await, And keep thy Faith to me inviolate. ['Tis then decreed above, that I must dye] The attribution of this poem is questionable.'Tis then decreed above, that I must dye, My deadly Pains admit no Remedy; And what's, in vain, apply'd to give me Ease But more exasperates the fierce Disease: Thy short-liv'd Pleasures all, my Soul, are dead, Zelinda is, for ever, from thee fled: Then cease, to murmur longer, and repine, And losing her, thy hated Life resign. Far from the Fair, who was my sole Delight, Far from those Eyes, which only charm'd my Sight, By various Passions toss'd, my wounded Soul, To each is made a Prey, without Controul. Of my once pleasing Flame, nought now remains, But cutting Sorrows, and Heart-wounding Pains; 'Till my sad Days, in deadly Langour pass'd, Quite sink me down in endless Night at last. Absence does still a Cure effectual prove, For the Soul-vexing Mem'ry of one's Love: But, woe is me! to quench my raging Flame, In vain I court the melancholy Dame; True, from Zelinda's Love, she'as banish'd me, And from her pleasing Talk and Company; But her bright Charms, whose Pow'r too well I know, Are ever present, to increase my Woe. [There all are upon groundless Quarrels bent] The attribution of this poem is questionable.There all are upon groundless Quarrels bent, And Duelling is hourly their Intent; Fully resolv'd their fancy'd Foes to end, Without respecting Brother, Prince, or Friend. There Rage, Suspicion, Anger, Envy, shed Their dang'rous Poison upon ev'ry Head, 'Till by their own, or other Hands, to fall All seek: For Fraud, and Horrour, reigns o'er all. [Suspicious, hot, and diffident I grew] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Suspicious, hot, and diffident I grew, To me my Heat seem'd reasonable too; My self, my self, tormented to my Shame, Till every Object troublesome became. [Ye Trees, and Flow'rs, I in my Transports cry'd] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Ye Trees, and Flow'rs, I in my Transports cry'd, Where does Zelinda from her Strephon hide? You are the Confidents of all her Cares; With you she spends whole Days, whilst I'm in Tears. Woe is me, wretched Man! if my Ingrate, Had to me kept her Faith inviolate, Why does she more delight in you, than me? And why for Yours, avoid my Company? [The mortal Enemy of Pain] The attribution of this poem is questionable.The mortal Enemy of Pain, Who, when he's ill us'd by the Fair, Don't whining stand, and sue in vain, Or give himself up to Despair: But arm'd with a Resentment brave, He wisely makes a quick Retreat, And often does a Lover save From an entire and sad Defeat. Stung with the Falshood of my Fair, No more to Love a Vow I made; And Spite so far prevail'd, I swear, That three whole Days from her I staid; But Grief and Care still stuck so close, And o'er my Soul had so much Pow'r; To dye her Slave I rather chose, Than cease so many Charms t'adore. [With Scorn and Rigour arm your Eyes] The attribution of this poem is questionable.With Scorn and Rigour arm your Eyes, Be haughty, cruel, and severe; If Anger in my Breast arise, I'll stifle it, and keep it there. No, no, whatever Pains I bear, Tho' Grief be painted in my Eyes; Ne'er shall my Heart rebellious dare, Repine, or say You tyrannize. Perhaps I languishing may mourn, And beg you not to be severe; But shou'd my Breast with Anger burn, I'll stifle it, and keep it there. [Think, think, how cutting is the Grief] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Think, think, how cutting is the Grief, When gall'd by a proud Beauty's Chain; To see the cruel, lovely Thief, Does only laugh at all our Pain. Think that a Lover can not live, Unless he sees whom he adores, And give me Hopes your Heart forgives And me to Favour once restores. Since tho' I've lightly been to blame, And grossly wrong'd my Charming Fair; Enough I have aton'd the same, By my sad Suff'ring and Despair. [And, which perhaps, may seem most strange] The attribution of this poem is questionable.And, which perhaps, may seem most strange, We of our Hearts made an Exchange; Zelinda, seizing first on mine, Did thereby her's to me resign; Thus I of her's became possess'd, And treasur'd it up in my Breast. [I was her sole Delight, with me] The attribution of this poem is questionable.I was her sole Delight, with me, She always cou'd have wish'd to be; In all my Griefs still bore a Share, And my least Hurt made her despair. [Pleasure's great Enemy, and Foe profess'd] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Pleasure's great Enemy, and Foe profess'd, Who still the fondest Lovers does molest; Who o'er the Passions bears impetuous Sway, And with Love's soft Desires can't away; Numbers infatuated, swell his Train, Charm'd with his empty Maxims, to their Pain; Which all our Pleasures criminal esteem, And the least Liberties reproachful deem. [Mourn, mourn, my Eyes, mourn your unhappy Fate] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Mourn, mourn, my Eyes, mourn your unhappy Fate; Mourn your Disgrace as unforeseen as great; Your Sight, Zelinda, will no longer bear, But has resum'd her Heart, and leaves you to despair. If you are blest when in her Eyes you look; If Pleasure in her Company you took; Weep, weep, my Eyes, with Floods of Tears run o'er, Those happy Days you never will see more. [Go, perfect Lovers, go, feast ev'ry Sense] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Go, perfect Lovers, go, feast ev'ry Sense, And of your Loves reap the sweet Recompence; My Presence now is of no Use to you, I've with your secret Pleasures nought to do. [There an eternal Spring is seen] The attribution of this poem is questionable.There an eternal Spring is seen, And th'azure Sky is still serene; A Thousand Roses hourly blow, Each Moment does fresh Wonders show; The Trees with Fruit o'erloaden stand; And seem to court the Gath'rer's Hand; Each Field is dress'd in lively Green, Around a thousand Caves are seen, (With Bows entwin'd, all shaded o'er, Lest prying Eyes shou'd ought explore.) Where Lovers pass each gladsome Day, In am'rous Sports, and wanton Play. These lonesome Caves, Time out of Mind, Have sacred been to Love, we find; Nature herself the Branches wove, The kind Receptacles of Love; Where all the little feather'd Quire, Pleas'd with their Mates, in Pairs retire; And make the Hills and Dales around, With Love inspiring Songs resound, And others to excite the Love, Themselves the pleasing Lesson prove. A Thousand little Riv'lets there, With their soft Murmurs fill the Air; Whilst kindly the still Nights conspire, To add fresh Fuel to Love's Fire. There Lovers ne'er are heard complain, Of their Fair's Rigour, or Disdain; But after many Troubles past, Joys e'en beyond their Wishes taste. Why say I more, since all that e'er, This World produced, or Great, or Fair, Have there Love's pleasing Passion try'd, And in their Lovers Arms have dy'd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A MAP OF THE ISLAND OF MARRIAGE. [How sweet to warble in a Cage] The attribution of this poem is questionable.How sweet to warble in a Cage, And with soft Notes our Cares t'asswage! All's there provided at our Need, Pure limpid Stream, good wholesome Seed; A kind She too, with whom to play, And sing and sport the Hours away: Thus said a Goldfinch blithe, when he Incag'd, a Linnet once did see, (Himself mean while at Liberty) With chearful Note, and joyous Sound, Who made his Prison Walls resound. So Damon when one Day he 'syp'd, A blooming Virgin, Nature's Pride, With Extasy and Rapture cry'd: Thrice happy I beyond Mankind, Were I but to that Fair One join'd, In an undissoluble Tye, With her to live, with her to die. But neither Cage nor Marriage State, E'er shew their Evils 'till too late; Nor Birds, nor Men, find out the Cheat, 'Till they are in, and past Retreat, O you, who burn with am'rous Fire, Wou'd you still keep alive Desire, And add fresh Fuel to the Flame, Still love, but never wed the Dame. [To satisfy Love's raging Flames] The attribution of this poem is questionable.To satisfy Love's raging Flames, We Mussulmans wed twenty Dames; Although, we own the strongest He, More than enough, will find one She: But this with us a Rule we make, 'Tis not too much a Score to take, So that among them we can find, One Wife that's gen'rous, just, and kind. [Ye virtuous Fair, our Island's Pride] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Ye virtuous Fair, our Island's Pride, Whose sterling Honour often try'd, Has always made a brave Defence; Hither without Distrust repair, Here you may live secure from Fear, Arm'd Cap-a-pee with Innocence. What tho' we are in Number few? We're all intrepid, staunch, and true, Nor Treachery, nor Ambush dread. Nor need we 'gainst our Honours's Foes, Implore the feeble Aid of Those, Who basely from our Colours fled. [On equal Hinges turns the Marriage State] The attribution of this poem is questionable.On equal Hinges turns the Marriage State, No Happiness therein's allowed by Fate, Too great a Disproportion if there be, In Fortune, Humour, Age, or Quality. [Gallants, who study Night and Day] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Gallants, who study Night and Day, To gain fresh Conquests o'er the Fair, The coyest she will fall a Prey, When her own Wants first lay the Snare. [Deceivers, Sly, Gallants, away] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Deceivers, Sly, Gallants, away, This is no Place for you to stay; Yourselves who value on base Arts, To circumvent weak Women's Hearts. This City is forbidden Ground, March off, nor in these Parts be found; You may indeed the Outworks view, But all within's forbidden you. [When once two Hearts which burn with mutual Fires] The attribution of this poem is questionable.When once two Hearts which burn with mutual Fires, With prudent Care conceal their fierce Desires, The subtlest He no easy Task will find, To part that Pair whom ardent Love has join'd. In vain a Fool may watch them up and down, He'll scratch his Horns at last, and sighing own, When Wife and Spark are firm combin'd to gull you, Do what you please, you'll find yourself their Cully. [Cease, jealous Fools, your Storming, cease] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Cease, jealous Fools, your Storming, cease, Which does but yout own Woes increase, And add fresh Fuel to our Fires, To teaze your Spouses Night and Day, Believe me, is the ready Way, To make them yield to loose Desires. Your unkind Blows, to tender Wives, Your causless Brawls, and restless Lives, In everlasting Discord spent; Will to yourselves most fatal prove, Will kindle Hate, instead of Love, And forward what you'd most prevent. [Whene'er We Lovers sue in vain] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Whene'er We Lovers sue in vain, And neither Sighs nor Vows avail, To move the Fair to ease our Pain, The Golden Key will never fail. [With us all lead contented Lives] The attribution of this poem is questionable.With us all lead contented Lives, None e'er conceal their soft Desires; But Gallants, Husbands, and their Wives, Burn openly with mutual Fires. For what does Secresy avail, To guard a buxom Female's Honour? The watchfull'st Husband's Care will fail, When once the loving Fit's upon her. To yield to Fate is then the best, And we the wisest Method follow; We drink, we feast, we take our Rest, And in Delights and Riches wallow. Ye jealous Fools, whose empty Pride, Makes you esteem our Conduct base, Had you but once the Difference try'd, Yourselves you'd soon wish in our Place. With Doubts and Fears, for ever cross'd, How much less happy Days d'ye pass! And who lives at another's Cost, Is not, I'm sure, the greatest Ass. [Pinchwife, the maddest of the horned Train] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Pinchwife, the maddest of the horned Train, Drunk with the Fumes that cloud his empty Brain, Consumes in Law the Income of a Lord, To be allowed a Cuckold on Record. Yet tell him, He's a Fool, and that the Town, Laugh at his Clamour, and deride his Moan; That ev'ry prudent Man in such a Case, Endeavours to keep secret his Disgrace; Go preach to such a Wretch! as well you might, Attempt to wash an Æthiopian white. [When real Ills upon us fall] The attribution of this poem is questionable.When real Ills upon us fall, If not felt, they're no Ills at all; Nor do they cause much Grief or Pain: But they whom fancied Ills oppress, Sworn Foes to their own Happiness, Are blest with Health and Wealth in vain. Incurable is their Disease, In vain one strives to give them Ease, E'en Remedies themselves offend; And all the fruitless Pains we take, On their sick Brain a Cure to make, T'exasperate them only tend. [Full happily, tho' something late] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Full happily, tho' something late, We're freed from the cursed Marriage State, That Bane and Torment of our Lives; You who've of late put on those Chains, And blame our Conduct, count your Gains, When your new Dears are grown meer Wives. A little Patience, we beseech, E're you begin to us to preach, And you e're long will surely find, That even they who fare the best, And envy'd are by all the rest, Are far from Blest in their own Mind. [Whilst th'angry Waves run Mountains high] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Whilst th'angry Waves run Mountains high, And o'er the shatter'd Vessel break, Throw over board, the Sailors cry, Your heaviest Goods, for all's at Stake. Pleas'd with this Order to comply, I to the Floods commit my Wife, For sure I am that never I, Had heavier Goods in all my Life. [Why will you part with that dear Liberty] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Why will you part with that dear Liberty, Which you've so sigh'd for, and so dearly bought? Why run again into that Slavery, Whence fortunately you by Death was brought? From shipwrack once escap'd the prudent Man, When he's arriv'd safe at his wished for Port, Tempts he the Dangers of the Sea again, To make himself of Winds and Waves the Sport? [Whoe'er, once freed from Marriage Chain] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Whoe'er, once freed from Marriage Chain, Hamper themselves therein again, Incorrigible write them down, A Title they can't well disown; And I, with all my Soul, consent, To doom them to the Punishment, Those harden'd Culprits must expect, Whom Mercy shewn will not affect. [Patience, too soon your Bliss you boast] The attribution of this poem is questionable.Patience, too soon your Bliss you boast, Perhaps you count without your Host; Already once the Fool you've play'd, And may again, you're not yet dead. [In th'Island which from Marriage takes its Name] The attribution of this poem is questionable.In th'Island which from Marriage takes its Name, Especially amongst the Jealous Sands, The watchfull'st, haughtiest, and discreetest Dame, With Difficulty can escape our Hands: Yet do we never open War declare, We are a kind of subtle Privateers; And when we find a tender hearted Fair, With all her num'rous Train of Hopes and Fears; Let Argus all his Hundred Eyes employ, Still will we be the Masters of the Field, In Spight of him we'll seize the killing Joy, And force the coyest, stubborn'st She to yield.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Art asleep Husband? A Boulster Lecture, Stored with all Variety of witty Jests, merry Tales, and other pleasant Passages; extracted from the choicest Flowers of Philosophy, Poesy, ancient and modern History. The Cure of CUCKOLDOM: A TALE. The attribution of this poem is questionable. The Secret from Italian Stores I bring, And of the Cure of Cuckoldom I sing; While jealous Husbands with Impatience hear, And wanton Wives yield an unwilling Ear. In Naples dwelt, as doth my Author say, Poor sober John, and sprightly Cithera; A Lawyer He, and of a wealthy Store, Much Business had, but still his Wife had more. The Court broke up, when he returning came, A Crowd of Company block'd up the Dame; At length they go.—Then prithee Cithera, Who were those Gentlemen above to day? The Count my Cousin and my Unkle Lord, Were all the Strangers here, upon my Word. Lectures were vain.—John stands without Reply, He nothing says,—but thinks it all a Lie. If o'er some crabbed Case he pores at home, For Air his sickly Dear abroad must roam. What tho' with her his Cousin Laura go? Women but sorry Guardians are ye know: Both may be guilty.—Where is then Belief? Do Sisters ever call a Sister—Thief? So much the Council's Brains, such Notions tost, The Brief's forgotten,—and the Cause is lost. To's Father-in-law full griev'd at last he goes, There tells his Sorrows, and repeats his Woes. Ay, (quoth the Sire) her Mother was just so, When first I wedded, forty Years ago; Her Years were then,—about some twenty five, The Age exactly of my precious Wife. I to reclaim her try'd, but try'd in vain; At last,—I e'en forbore the needless Pain. Thus let alone,—when to Threescore she came, Of herself she grew,—A Sober, Pious Dame. Now Jealous Husbands at my Tale look sour, And Wanton Wives approve—the certain Cure. FINIS.</field>
