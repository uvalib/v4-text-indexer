      <field name="fulltext">PART I VERSIONS (MORE OR LESS FREE) FROM THE IRISH DARK ROSALEEN. (From the Irish of Costello.) O my Dark Rosaleen, Do not sigh, do not weep! The priests are on the ocean green, They march along the Deep. There's wine . . . from the royal Pope Upon the ocean green; And Spanish ale shall give you hope, My Dark Rosaleen! My own Rosaleen! Shall glad your heart, shall give you hope, Shall give you health, and help, and hope, My Dark Rosaleen. Over hills and through dales Have I roamed for your sake; All yesterday I sailed with sails On river and on lake. The Erne . . . at its highest flood I dashed across unseen, For there was lightning in my blood, My Dark Rosaleen! My own Rosaleen! Oh! there was lightning in my blood, Red lightning lightened through my blood, My Dark Rosaleen! All day long in unrest To and fro do I move, The very soul within my breast Is wasted for you, love! The heart . . . in my bosom faints To think of you, my Queen, My life of life, my saint of saints, My Dark Rosaleen! My own Rosaleen! To hear your sweet and sad complaints, My life, my love, my saint of saints, My Dark Rosaleen! Woe and pain, pain and woe, Are my lot night and noon, To see your bright face clouded so, Like to the mournful moon. But yet . . . will I rear your throne Again in golden sheen; 'Tis you shall reign, shall reign alone, My Dark Rosaleen! My own Rosaleen! 'Tis you shall have the golden throne, 'Tis you shall reign, and reign alone, My Dark Rosaleen! Over dews, over sands Will I fly for your weal; Your holy delicate white hands Shall girdle me with steel. At home . . . in your emerald bowers, From morning's dawn till e'en, You'll pray for me, my flower of flowers, My Dark Rosaleen! My fond Rosaleen! You'll think of me through Daylight's hours, My virgin flower, my flower of flowers, My Dark Rosaleen! I could scale the blue air, I could plough the high hills, Oh, I could kneel all night in prayer, To heal your many ills! And one . . . beamy smile from you Would float like light between My toils and me, my own, my true, My Dark Rosaleen! My fond Rosaleen! Would give me life and soul anew, A second life, a soul anew, My Dark Rosaleen! O! the Erne shall run red With redundance of blood, The earth shall rock beneath our tread, And flames wrap hill and wood, And gun-peal, and slogan cry, Wake many a glen serene, Ere you shall fade, ere you shall die, My Dark Rosaleen! My own Rosaleen! The Judgment Hour must first be nigh, Ere you can fade, ere you can die, My Dark Rosaleen! THE DREAM OF JOHN MAC DONNELL. (From the Irish of John Mac Donnell, Clarach.) I lay in unrest—old thoughts of pain, That I struggled in vain to smother, Like midnight spectres haunted my brain— Dark fantasies chased each other; When, lo! a Figure—who might it be— A tall fair figure stood near me! Who might it be? An unreal Banshee? Or an angel sent to cheer me? Though years have rolled since then, yet now My memory thrillingly lingers On her awful charms, her waxen brow, Her pale, translucent fingers, Her eyes that mirrored a wonder-world, Her mien of unearthly mildness, And her waving raven tresses that curled To the ground in beautiful wildness. “Whence comest thou, Spirit?” I asked, methought; “Thou art not one of the Banished!” Alas, for me! she answered nought, But rose aloft and evanished; And a radiance, like to a glory, beamed In the light she left behind her. Long time I wept, and at last medreamed I left my shieling to find her. And first I turned to the thunderous North, To Gruagach's mansion kingly; Untouching the earth I then sped forth To Inver-lough, and the shingly And shining strand of the fishful Erne, And thence to Cruachan the golden, Of whose resplendent palace ye learn So many a marvel olden— I saw the Mourna's billows flow— I passed the walls of Shenady, And stood in the hero-thronged Ardroe, Embosked amid greenwoods shady; And visited that proud pile that stands Above the Boyne's broad waters, Where Ængus dwells, with his warrior-bands And the fairest of Ulster's daughters. To the halls of Mac Lir, to Creevroe's height, To Tara, the glory of Erin, To the fairy palace that glances bright On the peak of the blue Cnocfeerin, I vainly hied. I went west and east— I travelled seaward and shoreward— But thus was I greeted at field and at feast— “Thy way lies onward and forward!” At last I reached, I wist not how, The royal towers of Ival, Which under the cliff's gigantic brow, Still rise without a rival; And here were Thomond's chieftains all, With armour, and swords, and lances, And here sweet music filled the hall And damsels charmed with dances. And here, at length, on a silvery throne, Half seated, half reclining, With forehead white as the marble stone, And garments so starrily shining, And features beyond the poet's pen— The sweetest, saddest features— Appeared before me once again, The fairest of Living Creatures! “Draw near, O mortal!” she said, with a sigh, “And hear my mournful story! The Guardian-Spirit of Erin am I, But dimmed is mine ancient glory; My priests are banished, my warriors wear No longer victory's garland; And my Child, my Son, my beloved Heir, Is an exile in a far land!” I heard no more—I saw no more— The bands of slumber were broken; And palace and hero, and river and shore, Had vanished, and left no token. Dissolved was the spell that had bound my will And my fancy thus for a season; But a sorrow therefore hangs over me still, Despite of the teachings of Reason! O'HUSSEY'S ODE TO THE MAGUIRE. (From the Irish of O'Hussey.) Where is my Chief, my Master, this bleak night, mavrone! O, cold, cold, miserably cold is this bleak night for Hugh, It's showery, arrowy, speary sleet pierceth one through and through, Pierceth one to the very bone! Rolls real thunder? Or was that red, livid light Only a meteor? I scarce know; but through the midnight dim The pitiless ice-wind streams. Except the hate that persecutes him Nothing hath crueller venomy might. An awful, a tremendous night is this, meseems! The flood-gates of the rivers of heaven, I think, have been burst wide— Down from the overcharged clouds, like unto headlong ocean's tide, Descends grey rain in roaring streams. Though he were even a wolf ranging the round green woods, Though he were even a pleasant salmon in the unchainable sea, Though he were a wild mountain eagle, he could scarce bear, he, This sharp, sore sleet, these howling floods. O, mournful is my soul this night for Hugh Maguire! Darkly, as in a dream, he strays! Before him and behind Triumphs the tyrannous anger of the wounding wind, The wounding wind, that burns as fire! It is my bitter grief—it cuts me to the heart— That in the country of Clan Darry this should be his fate! O, woe is me, where is he? Wandering, houseless, desolate, Alone, without or guide or chart! Medreams I see just now his face, the strawberry bright, Uplifted to the blackened heavens, while the tempestuous winds Blow fiercely over and round him, and the smiting sleet-shower blinds The hero of Galang to-night! Large, large affliction unto me and mine it is, That one of his majestic bearing, his fair, stately form, Should thus be tortured and o'erborne—that this unsparing storm Should wreak its wrath on head like his! That his great hand, so oft the avenger of the oppressed, Should this chill, churlish night, perchance, be paralysed by frost— While through some icicle-hung thicket—as one lorn and lost— He walks and wanders without rest. The tempest-driven torrent deluges the mead, It overflows the low banks of the rivulets and ponds— The lawns and pasture-grounds lie locked in icy bonds So that the cattle cannot feed. The pale bright margins of the streams are seen by none. Rushes and sweeps along the untamable flood on every side— It penetrates and fills the cottagers' dwellings far and wide— Water and land are blent in one. Through some dark woods, 'mid bones of monsters, Hugh now strays, As he confronts the storm with anguished heart, but manly brow— O! what a sword-wound to that tender heart of his were now A backward glance at peaceful days. But other thoughts are his—thoughts that can still inspire With joy and an onward-bounding hope the bosom of Mac-Nee— Thoughts of his warriors charging like bright billows of the sea, Borne on the wind's wings, flashing fire! And though frost glaze to-night the clear dew of his eyes, And white ice-gauntlets glove his noble fine fair fingers o'er, A warm dress is to him that lightning-garb he ever wore, The lightning of the soul, not skies. AVRAN. Hugh marched forth to the fight—I grieved to see him so depart; And lo! to-night he wanders frozen, rain-drenched, sad, betrayed— But the memory of the lime-white mansions his right hand hath laid In ashes warms the hero's heart! A LAMENTATION FOR THE DEATH OF SIR MAURICE FITZGERALD, KNIGHT OF KERRY. (From the Irish of Pierce Ferriter.) There was lifted up one voice of woe, One lament of more than mortal grief, Through the wide South to and fro, For a fallen Chief. In the dead of night that cry thrilled through me, I looked out upon the midnight air! Mine own soul was all as gloomy, And I knelt in prayer. O'er Loch Gur, that night, once—twice—yea, thrice— Passed a wail of anguish for the Brave That half curdled into ice Its moon-mirroring wave. Then uprose a many-toned wild hymn in Choral swell from Ogra's dark ravine, And Mogeely's Phantom Women Mourned the Geraldine! Far on Carah Mona's emerald plains Shrieks and sighs were blended many hours, And Fermoy in fitful strains Answered from her towers. Youghal, Keenalmeaky, Eemokilly Mourned in concert, and their piercing keen Woke to wondering life the stilly Glens of Inchiqueen. From Loughmoe to yellow Dunanore There was fear; the traders of Tralee Gathered up their golden store, And prepared to flee; For, in ship and hall from night till morning Showed the first faint beamings of the sun, All the foreigners heard the warning Of the Dreaded One! “This,” they spake, “portendeth death to us, If we fly not swiftly from our fate!” Self-conceited idiots! thus Ravingly to prate! Not for base-born higgling Saxon trucksters Ring laments like those by shore and sea! Not for churls with souls of hucksters Waileth our Banshee! For the high Milesian race alone Ever flows the music of her woe! For slain heir to bygone throne, And for Chief laid low! Hark! . . . Again, methinks, I hear her weeping Yonder! Is she near me now, as then? Or was't but the night-wind sweeping Down the hollow glen? THE WOMAN OF THREE COWS. (From the Irish.) O woman of Three Cows, agra! don't let your tongue thus rattle! O, don't be saucy, don't be stiff, because you may have cattle. I have seen—and, here's my hand to you, I only say what's true— A many a one with twice your stock not half so proud as you. Good luck to you, don't scorn the poor, and don't be their despiser, For worldly wealth soon melts away, and cheats the very miser, And Death soon strips the proudest wreath from haughty human brows; Then don't be stiff, and don't be proud, good Woman of Three Cows! See where Momonia's heroes lie, proud Owen More's descendants, 'Tis they that won the glorious name, and had the grand attendants! If they were forced to bow to Fate, as every mortal bows, Can you be proud, can you be stiff, my Woman of Three Cows! The brave sons of the Lord of Clare, they left the land to mourning; Mavrone! for they were banished, with no hope of their returning— Who knows in what abodes of want those youths were driven to house? Yet you can give yourself these airs, O Woman of Three Cows! O, think of Donnell of the Ships, the Chief whom nothing daunted— See how he fell in distant Spain, unchronicled, unchanted! He sleeps, the great O'Sullivan, where thunder cannot rouse— Then ask yourself, should you be proud, good Woman of Three Cows! O'Ruark, Maguire, those souls of fire, whose names are shrined in story— Think how their high achievements once made Erin's highest glory— Yet now their bones lie mouldering under weeds and cypress boughs, And so, for all your pride, will yours, O Woman of Three Cows! The O'Carrolls, also, famed when Fame was only for the boldest, Rest in forgotten sepulchres with Erin's best and oldest; Yet who so great as they of yore in battle or carouse? Just think of that, and hide your head, good Woman of Three Cows! Your neighbour's poor, and you, it seems, are big with vain ideas, Because, inagh! you've got three cows—one more, I see, than she has. That tongue of yours wags more at times than Charity allows, But if you're strong, be merciful, great Woman of Three Cows! THE SUMMING UP. Now, there you go! You still, of course, keep up your scornful bearing, And I'm too poor to hinder you; but, by the cloak I'm wearing, If I had but four cows myself, even though you were my spouse, I'd thwack you well to cure your pride, my Woman of Three Cows! KATHALEEN NY-HOULAHAN. (From the Irish of William Heffernan.) Long they pine in weary woe, the nobles of our land, Long they wander to and fro, proscribed, alas! and banned; Feastless, houseless, altarless, they bear the exile's brand, But their hope is in the coming-to of Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan! Think her not a ghostly hag, too hideous to be seen, Call her not unseemly names, our matchless Kathaleen; Young she is, and fair she is, and would be crowned a queen, Were the king's son at home here with Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan! Sweet and mild would look her face, O, none so sweet and mild, Could she crush the foes by whom her beauty is reviled; Woollen plaids would grace herself and robes of silk her child, If the king's son were living here with Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan! Sore disgrace it is to see the Arbitress of thrones, Vassal to a Saxoneen of cold and sapless bones! Bitter anguish wrings our souls—with heavy sighs and groans We wait the Young Deliverer of Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan! Let us pray to Him who holds Life's issues in His hands— Him who formed the mighty globe, with all its thousand lands; Girding them with seas and mountains, rivers deep, and strands, To cast a look of pity upon Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan! He, who over sands and waves led Israël along— He, who fed, with heavenly bread, that chosen tribe and throng— He, who stood by Moses, when his foes were fierce and strong— May He show forth His might in saving Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan. LAMENT FOR THE PRINCES OF TYRONE AND TYRCONNELL (BURIED IN ROME). (From the Irish of Hugh Macward.) O Woman of the Piercing Wail, Who mournest o'er yon mound of clay With sigh and groan, Would God thou wert among the Gael! Thou wouldst not then from day to day Weep thus alone. 'Twere long before, around a grave In green Tirconnell, one could find This loneliness; Near where Beann-Boirche's banners wave Such grief as thine could ne'er have pined Companionless. Beside the wave, in Donegall, In Antrim's glens, or fair Dromore, Or Killilee, Or where the sunny waters fall, At Assaroe, near Erna's shore, This could not be. On Derry's plains—in rich Drumclieff— Throughout Armagh the Great, renowned In olden years, No day could pass but Woman's grief Would rain upon the burial-ground Fresh floods of tears! O, no!—from Shannon, Boyne, and Suir, From high Dunluce's castle-walls, From Lissadill, Would flock alike both rich and poor, One wail would rise from Cruachan's halls To Tara's hill; And some would come from Barrow-side, And many a maid would leave her home On Leitrim's plains, And by melodious Banna's tide, And by the Mourne and Erne, to come And swell thy strains! O, horses' hoofs would trample down The Mount whereon the martyr-saint Was crucified. From glen and hill, from plain and town, One loud lament, one thrilling plaint, Would echo wide. There would not soon be found, I ween One foot of ground among those bands For museful thought, So many shriekers of the keen Would cry aloud, and clap their hands, All woe-distraught! Two princes of the line of Conn Sleep in their cells of clay beside O'Donnell Roe: Three royal youths, alas! are gone, Who lived for Erin's weal, but died For Erin's woe! Ah! could the men of Ireland read The names these noteless burial-stones Display to view, Their wounded hearts afresh would bleed, Their tears gush forth again, their groans Resound anew! The youths whose relics moulder here Were sprung from Hugh, high Prince and Lord Of Aileach's land. Thy noble brothers, justly dear, Thy nephew, long to be deplored By Ulster's bands. Theirs were not souls wherein dull Time Could domicile Decay or house Decrepitude! They passed from earth ere Manhood's prime, Ere years had power to dim their brows Or chill their blood. And who can marvel o'er thy grief, Or who can blame thy flowing tears, That knows their source? O'Donnell, Dunnasava's chief, Cut off amid his vernal years, Lies here a corse Beside his brother Cathbar, whom Tirconnell of the Helmets mourns In deep despair— For valour, truth, and comely bloom, For all that greatens and adorns, A peerless pair. O, had these twain, and he, the third, The Lord of Mourne, O'Niall's son, Their mate in death— A prince in look, in deed, and word— Had these three heroes yielded on The field their breath, O, had they fallen on Criffan's plain, There would not be a town or clan From shore to sea But would with shrieks bewail the Slain, Or chant aloud the exulting rann Of jubilee! When high the shout of battle rose, On fields where Freedom's torch still burned Through Erin's gloom, If one, if barely one of those Were slain, all Ulster would have mourned The hero's doom! If at Athboy, where hosts of brave Ulidian horsemen sank beneath The shock of spears, Young Hugh O'Neill had found a grave, Long must the North have wept his death With heart-wrung tears! If on the day of Ballach-myre The Lord of Mourne had met, thus young, A warrior's fate, In vain would such as thou desire To mourn, alone, the champion sprung From Niall the Great! No marvel this—for all the Dead, Heaped on the field, pile over pile, At Mallach-brack, Were scarce an eric for his head, If Death had stayed his footsteps while On victory's track! If on the Day of Hostages The fruit had from the parent bough Been rudely torn In sight of Munster's bands—Mac-Nee's— Such blow the blood of Conn, I trow, Could ill have borne. If on the day of Ballach-boy Some arm had laid, by foul surprise, The chieftain low, Even our victorious shout of joy Would soon give place to rueful cries And groans of woe! If on the day the Saxon host Were forced to fly—a day so great For Ashanee— The Chief had been untimely lost, Our conquering troops should moderate Their mirthful glee. There would not lack on Lifford's day, From Galway, from the glens of Boyle, From Limerick's towers, A marshalled file, a long array Of mourners to bedew the soil With tears in showers! If on the day a sterner fate Compelled his flight from Athenree, His blood had flowed, What numbers all disconsolate Would come unasked, and share with thee Affliction's load! If Derry's crimson field had seen His life-blood offered up, though 'twere On Victory's shrine, A thousand cries would swell the keen, A thousand voices in despair Would echo thine! Oh, had the fierce Dalcassian swarm That bloody night on Fergus' banks, But slain our Chief, When rose his camp in wild alarm— How would the triumph of his ranks Be dashed with grief! How would the troops of Murbach mourn If on the Curlew Mountains' day, Which England rued, Some Saxon hand had left them lorn, By shedding there, amid the fray, Their prince's blood! Red would have been our warriors' eyes Had Roderick found on Sligo's field A gory grave, No Northern Chief would soon arise So sage to guide, so strong to shield, So swift to save. Long would Leith-Cuinn have wept if Hugh Had met the death he oft had dealt Among the foe; But, had our Roderick fallen too, All Erin must, alas! have felt The deadly blow! What do I say? Ah, woe is me! Already we bewail in vain Their fatal fall! And Erin, once the Great and Free, Now vainly mourns her breakless chain, And iron thrall! Then, daughter of O'Donnell! dry Thine overflowing eyes, and turn Thy heart aside! For Adam's race is born to die, And sternly the sepulchral urn Mocks human pride! Look not, nor sigh, for earthly throne, Nor place thy trust in arm of clay— But on thy knees Uplift thy soul to God alone, For all things go their destined way As He decrees. Embrace the faithful Crucifix, And seek the path of pain and prayer Thy Saviour trod; Nor let thy spirit intermix With earthly hope and worldly care Its groans to God! And thou, O mighty Lord! whose ways Are far above our feeble minds To understand, Sustain us in these doleful days, And render light the chain that binds Our fallen land! Look down upon our dreary state, And through the ages that may still Roll sadly on, Watch Thou o'er hapless Erin's fate, And shield at least from darker ill The blood of Conn! LAMENT OVER THE RUINS OF THE ABBEY OF TEACH MOLAGA. (From the Irish.) I wandered forth at night alone Along the dreary, shingly, billow-beaten shore; Sadness that night was in my bosom's core, My soul and strength lay prone. The thin wan moon, half overveiled By clouds, shed her funereal beams upon the scene; While in low tones, with many a pause between, The mournful night-wind wailed. Musing of Life, and Death, and Fate, I slowly paced along, heedless of aught around, Till on the hill, now, alas! ruin-crowned, Lo! the old Abbey-gate! Dim in the pallid moonlight stood, Crumbling to slow decay, the remnant of that pile Within which dwelt so many saints erewhile In loving brotherhood! The memory of the men who slept Under those desolate walls—the solitude—the hour— Mine own lorn mood of mind—all joined to o'erpower My spirit—and I wept! In yonder Goshen once—I thought— Reigned Piety and Peace: Virtue and Truth were there; With Charity and the blessed spirit of Prayer Was each fleet moment fraught! There, unity of Work and Will Blent hundreds into one: no jealousies or jars Troubled their placid lives: their fortunate stars Had triumphed o'er all Ill! There, kneeled each morn and even The Bell for Matin—Vesper: Mass was said or sung— From the bright silver censer as it swung Rose balsamy clouds to Heaven. Through the round cloistered corridors A many a midnight hour, bareheaded and unshod, Walked the Grey Friars, beseeching from their God Peace for these western shores. The weary pilgrim bowed by Age Oft found asylum there—found welcome, and found wine. Oft rested in its halls the Paladine, The Poet and the Sage! Alas! alas! how dark the change! Now round its mouldering walls, over its pillars low, The grass grows rank, the yellow gowans blow, Looking so sad and strange! Unsightly stones choke up its wells; The owl hoots all night long under the altar-stairs; The fox and badger make their darksome lairs In its deserted cells! Tempest and Time—the drifting sands— The lightning and the rains—the seas that sweep around These hills in winter-nights, have awfully crowned The work of impious hands! The sheltering, smooth-stoned massive wall— The noble figured roof—the glossy marble piers— The monumental shapes of elder years— Where are they? Vanished all! Rite, incense, chant, prayer, mass, have ceased— All, all have ceased! Only the whitening bones half sunk In the earth now tell that ever here dwelt monk, Friar, acolyte, or priest. Oh! woe, that Wrong should triumph thus! Woe that the olden right, the rule and the renown Of the Pure-souled and Meek should thus go down Before the Tyrannous! Where wert thou, Justice, in that hour? Where was thy smiting sword? What had those good men done, That thou shouldst tamely see them trampled on By brutal England's Power? Alas! I rave! . . . If Change is here, Is it not o'er the land? Is it not too in me? Yes! I am changed even more than what I see. Now is my last goal near! My worn limbs fail—my blood moves cold— Dimness is on mine eyes—I have seen my children die; They lie where I too in brief space shall lie— Under the grassy mould! I turned away, as toward my grave, And, all my dark way homeward by the Atlantic's verge, Resounded in mine ears like to a dirge The roaring of the wave. THE DAWNING OF THE DAY. (From the Irish of O'Doran.) 'Twas a balmy summer morning Warm and early, Such as only June bestows; Everywhere the earth adorning, Dews lay pearly In the lily-bell and rose. Up from each green leafy bosk and hollow Rose the blackbird's pleasant lay, And the soft cuckoo was sure to follow. 'Twas the Dawning of the Day! Through the perfumed air the golden Bees flew round me: Bright fish dazzled from the sea, 'Till medreamt some fairy olden World-spell bound me In a trance of witcherie. Steeds pranced round anon with stateliest housings, Bearing riders prankt in rich array, Like flushed revellers after wine-carousings— 'Twas the Dawning of the Day! Then a strain of song was chanted, And the lightly Floating sea-nymphs drew anear. Then again the shore seemed haunted By hosts brightly Clad, and wielding shield and spear! Then came battle-shouts—and onward rushing— Swords and chariots, and a phantom fray. Then all vanished; the warm skies were blushing In the Dawning of the Day! Cities girt with glorious gardens Whose immortal Habitants in robes of light Stood, methought, as angel-wardens Nigh each portal, Now arose to daze my sight. Eden spread around, revived and blooming; When . . . lo! as I gazed, all passed away— . . . I saw but black rocks looming In the dim chill Dawn of Day! THE TESTAMENT OF CATHAEIR MOR. (From the Irish.) Here is the Will of Cathaeir Mor. God rest him. Among his heirs he divided his store, His treasures and lands, And, first, laying hands On his son Ross Faly, he blessed him. “My Sovereign Power, my nobleness, My wealth, my strength to curse and bless, My royal privilege of protection, I leave to the son of my best affection, Ross Faly, Ross of the Rings, Worthy descendant of Ireland's Kings! To serve as memorials of succession For all who yet shall claim their possession In after ages. Clement and noble and bold Is Ross, my son. “Then let him not hoard up silver and gold, But give unto all fair measure of wages. Victorious in battle he ever hath been; He therefore shall yield the green And glorious plains of Tara to none, No, not to his brothers! Yet these shall he aid When attacked or betrayed. This blessing of mine shall outlast the tomb, And live till the Day of Doom, Telling and telling daily, That a prosperous man, beyond all others, Shall prove Ross Faly!” Then he gave him ten shields, and ten rings, and ten swords, And ten drinking-horns; and he spake him those words: “Brightly shall shine the glory, O Ross, of my sons and heirs Never shall flourish in story Such heroes as they and theirs!” Then, laying his royal hand on the head Of his good son, Darry, he blessed him and said:— “My Valour, my daring, my martial courage, My skill in the field I leave to Darry, That he be a guiding torch and starry Light and Lamp to the hosts of our age. A hero to sway, to lead and command, Shall be every son of his tribes in the land! O Darry, with boldness and power Sit thou on the frontier of Tuath Lann. And ravage the lands of Deas Ghower. Accept no gifts for thy protection From woman or man, So shall Heaven assuredly bless Thy many daughters with fruitfulness, And none shall stand above thee— For I, thy sire, who love thee With deep and warm affection, I prophesy unto thee all success Over the green battalions Of the redoubtable Galions.” And he gave him, thereon, as memorials and needs, Eight bondsmen, eight handmaids, eight cups, and eight steeds. The noble Monarch of Erin's men Spake thus to the young Prince Brassal, then:— “My Sea, with all its wealth of streams, I leave to my sweetly-speaking Brassal To serve and to succour him as a vassal, And the land whereon the bright sun beams Around the waves of Amergin's Bay As parcelled out in the ancient day: By free men through a long, long time Shall this thy heritage be enjoyed— But the chieftaincy shall at last be destroyed Because of a Prince's crime, And though others again shall regain it, Yet Heaven shall not bless it, For Power shall oppress it, And Weakness and Baseness shall stain it!” And he gave him six ships, and six steeds, and six shields, Six mantles and six coats of steel— And the six royal oxen that wrought in his fields, These gave he to Brassal the Prince for his weal. Then to Catach, he spake:— “My border lands Thou, Catach, shalt take, But ere long they shall pass from thy hands, And by thee shall none Be ever begotten, daughter or son!” To Fearghus Luascan spake he thus:— “Thou Fearghus, also, art one of us, But over-simple in all thy ways, And babblest much of thy childish days, For thee have I nought, but if lands may be bought Or won hereafter by sword or lance, Of those, perchance, I may leave thee a part All simple babbler and boy as thou art!” Young Fearghus, therefore, was left bereaven, And thus the Monarch spake to Creeven:— “To my boyish Hero, my gentle Creeven, Who loveth in Summer, at morn and even, To snare the songful birds of the field, But shunneth to look on spear and shield, I have little to give of all that I share. His fame shall fail, his battles be rare. And of all the Kings that wear his crown, But one alone shall win renown.” And he gave him six cloaks, and six cups, and seven steeds, And six harnessed oxen, all fresh from the meads. But on Aenghus Nic, a younger child, Begotten in crime and born in woe, The father frowned, as on one defiled, And with lowering brow he spake him so:— “To Nic, my son, that base-born youth, Shall nought be given of land or gold; He may be great and good and bold, But his birth is an agony all untold, Which gnaweth him like a serpent's tooth. I am no donor To him or his race— His birth was dishonour; His life is disgrace!” And thus he spake to Eochy Timin, Deeming him fit but to herd with women:— “Weak son of mine, thou shalt not gain Waste or water, valley or plain. From thee shall none descend save cravens, Sons of sluggish sire and mothers, Who shall live and die, But give no corpses to the ravens, Mine ill thought and mine evil eye On thee beyond thy brothers Shall ever, ever lie!” And to Oilioll Cadach his words were those:— “O Oilioll, great in coming years Shall be thy fame among friends and foes As the first of Brughaidhs and Hospitaliers! But neither noble nor warlike Shall show thy renownless dwelling; Nevertheless Thou shalt dazzle at chess, Therein supremely excelling And shining as something starlike!” And his chess-board, therefore, and chessmen eke He gave to Oilioll Cadach the Meek. Now Fiacha—youngest son was he, Stood up by the bed . . . of his father, who said, The while, caressing Him tenderly:— “My son! I have only for thee my blessing, And naught beside— Hadst best abide With thy brothers a time, as thy years are green.” Then Fiacha wept, with a sorrowful mien: So Cathaeir spake, to encourage him, gaily, With cheerful speech— “Abide one month with thy brethren each, And seven years long with my son, Ross Faly; Do this, and thy sire in sincerity, Prophesies unto thee fame and prosperity.” And further he spake, as one inspired:— “A Chieftain flourishing, feared, and admired Shall Fiacha prove! The gifted Man from the boiling Berve, Him shall his brothers' clansmen serve. His forts shall be Aillin and proud Almain, He shall reign in Carman and Allen; The highest renown shall his palaces gain When others have crumbled and fallen, His powers shall broaden and lengthen, And never know damage or loss; The impregnable Naas he shall strengthen, And govern Ailbhe and Arriged Ross. Yes! O Fiacha, Foe of strangers, This shall be thy lot! And thou shalt pilot Ladhrann and Leeven with steady and even Heart and arm through storm and dangers! Overthrown by thy mighty hand Shall the Lords of Tara lie. And Taillte's fair, the first in the land, Thou, son, shall magnify; And many a country thou yet shalt bring To own thy rule as Ceann and King. The blessing I give thee shall rest On thee and thy seed While Time shall endure, Thou grandson of Fiacha the blest! It is barely thy meed, For thy soul is childlike and pure!” THE EXPEDITION AND DEATH OF KING DATHY. (From the Irish.) King Dathy assembled his Druids and Sages, And thus he spake them:—“Druids and Sages! What of King Dathy? What is revealed in Destiny's pages Of him or his? Hath he Aught for the Future to dread or to dree? Good to rejoice in, or Evil to flee? Is he a foe of the Gall Fitted to conquer, or fated to fall?” And Beirdra, the Druid, made answer as thus— A priest of a hundred years was he:— “Dathy! thy fate is not hidden from us! Hear it through me! Thou shalt work thine own will! Thou shalt slay—thou shalt prey— And be Conqueror still! Thee the Earth shall not harm! Thee we charter and charm From all evil and ill; Thee the laurel shall crown! Thee the wave shall not drown! Thee the chain shall not bind! Thee the spear shall not find! Thee the sword shall not slay! Thee the shaft shall not pierce! Thou, therefore, be fearless and fierce, And sail with thy warriors away To the lands of the Gall, There to slaughter and sway, And be Victor o'er all!” So Dathy he sailed away, away, Over the deep resounding sea; Sailed with his hosts in armour grey Over the deep resounding sea, Many a night and many a day, And many an islet conquered he— He and his hosts in armour grey. And the billow drowned him not, And a fetter bound him not, And the blue spear found him not, And the red sword slew him not, And the swift shaft knew him not, And the foe o'erthrew him not. Till, one bright morn, at the base Of the Alps, in rich Ausonia's regions, His men stood marshalled face to face With the mighty Roman legions. Noble foes! Christian and heathen stood there among those, Resolute all to overcome, Or die for the Eagles of Ancient Rome! When, behold! from a temple anear Came forth an aged priest-like man, Of a countenance meek and clear. Who, turning to Eire's Ceann, Spake him as thus:—“King Dathy! hear! Thee would I warn! Retreat! retire! Repent in time The invader's crime. Or better for thee thou hadst never been born!” But Dathy replied: “False Nazarene! Dost thou, then, menace Dathy, thou? And dreamest thou that he will bow To one unknown, to one so mean, So powerless as a priest must be? He scorns alike thy threats and thee! On! on, my men, to victory!” And with loud shouts for Eire's king, The Irish rush to meet the foe, And falchions clash and bucklers ring— When, lo! Lo! a mighty earthquake's shock! And the cleft plains reel and rock; Clouds of darkness pall the skies; Thunder crashes, Lightning flashes, And in an instant Dathy lies On the earth a mass of blackened ashes! Then, mournfully and dolefully The Irish warriors sailed away Over the deep resounding sea, Till, wearily and mournfully, They anchored in Eblana's Bay. Thus the Seanachies and Sages Tell this tale of long-gone ages. PRINCE ALFRID'S ITINERARY THROUGH IRELAND. (From the Irish.) I found in Innisfail the fair, In Ireland while in exile there, Women of worth, both grave and gay men, Many clerics and many laymen. I travelled its fruitful provinces round, And in every one of the five I found, Alike in church, and in palace hall, Abundant apparel and food for all. Gold and silver I found, and money, Plenty of wheat and plenty of honey; I found God's people rich in pity, Found many a feast and many a city. I also found in Armagh the splendid, Meekness, wisdom, and prudence blended, Fasting as Christ hath recommended, And noble councillors untranscended. I found in each great church, moreo'er, Whether on island or on shore, Piety, learning, fond affection, Holy welcome and kind protection. I found the good lay monks and brothers Ever beseeching help for others, And in their keeping the holy word Pure as it came from Jesus the Lord. I found in Munster unfettered of any, Kings, and queens, and poets a many— Poets well skilled in music and measure, Prosperous doings, mirth and pleasure. I found in Connaught the just, redundance Of riches, milk in lavish abundance, Hospitality, vigour, fame, In Cruachan's land of heroic name. I found in the country of Connall the glorious, Bravest heroes, ever victorious; Fair-complexioned men and warlike, Ireland's lights, the high, the starlike! I found in Ulster, from hill to glen, Hardy warriors, resolute men; Beauty that bloomed when youth was gone, And strength transmitted from sire to son. I found in the noble district of Boyle, (MS. here illegible.) Brehons, Erenachs, weapons bright, And horsemen bold and sudden in fight. I found in Leinster the smooth and sleek, From Dublin to Slewmargy's peak; Flourishing pastures, valour, health, Long-living worthies, commerce, wealth. I found, besides, from Ara to Glea, In the broad rich country of Ossorie, Sweet fruits, good laws for all and each, Great chess-players, men of truthful speech. I found in Meath's fair principality, Virtue, vigour, and hospitality; Candour, joyfulness, bravery, purity, Ireland's bulwark and security. I found strict morals in age and youth, I found historians recording truth; The things I sing of in verse unsmooth, I found them all—I have written sooth. LAMENT FOR BANBA. (From the Irish of Egan O'Rahilly.) O my land! O my love! What a woe, and how deep, Is thy death to my long mourning soul! God alone, God above, Can awake thee from sleep, Can release thee from bondage and dole! Alas, alas, and alas! For the once proud people of Banba! As a tree in its prime, Which the axe layeth low, Didst thou fall, O unfortunate land! Not by Time, nor thy crime, Came the shock and the blow. They were given by a false felon hand! Alas, alas, and alas! For the once proud people of Banba! O, my grief of all griefs, Is to see how thy throne Is usurped, whilst thyself art in thrall! Other lands have their chiefs, Have their kings, thou alone Art a wife, yet a widow withal! Alas, alas, and alas! For the once proud people of Banba! The high house of O'Neill Is gone down to the dust, The O'Brien is clanless and banned; And the steel, the red steel, May no more be the trust Of the Faithful and Brave in the land! Alas, alas, and alas! For the once proud people of Banba! True, alas! Wrong and Wrath Were of old all too rife. Deeds were done which no good man admires: And perchance Heaven hath Chastened us for the strife And the blood-shedding ways of our sires! Alas, alas, and alas! For the once proud people of Banba! But, no more! This our doom, While our hearts yet are warm, Let us not over-weakly deplore! For the hour soon may loom When the Lord's mighty hand Shall be raised for our rescue once more! And our grief shall be turned into joy For the still proud people of Banba! ELLEN BAWN. (From the Irish.) Ellen Bawn, O Ellen Bawn, you darling, darling dear, you, Sit awhile beside me here, I'll die unless I'm near you! 'Tis for you I'd swim the Suir and breast the Shannon's waters; For, Ellen dear, you've not your peer in Galway's blooming daughters! Had I Limerick's gems and gold at will to mete and measure, Were Loughrea's abundance mine, and all Portumna's treasure, These might lure me, might insure me many and many a new love, But O! no bribe could pay your tribe for one like you, my true love! Blessings be on Connaught! that's the place for sport and raking! Blessing, too, my love, on you, a-sleeping and a-waking! I'd have met you, dearest Ellen, when the sun went under, But, woe! the flooding Shannon broke across my path in thunder! Ellen! I'd give all the deer in Limerick's parks and arbours, Ay, and all the ships that rode last year in Munster's harbours, Could I blot from Time the hour I first became your lover, For, O! you've given my heart a wound it never can recover! Would to God that in the sod my corpse to-night were lying, And the wild birds wheeling o'er it, and the winds a-sighing, Since your cruel mother and your kindred choose to sever Two hearts that Love would blend in one for ever and for ever! ST. PATRICK'S HYMN BEFORE TARA. (From the Irish.) At Tara to-day, in this awful hour, I call on the Holy Trinity! Glory to Him who reigneth in power, The God of the elements, Father and Son, And Paraclete Spirit, which Three are the One, The ever-existing Divinity! At Tara to-day I call on the Lord, On Christ the Omnipotent Word, Who came to redeem from Death and Sin Our fallen race; And I put and I place The virtue that lieth and liveth in His Incarnation lowly, His Baptism pure and holy, His life of toil, and tears, and affliction, His dolorous Death—His Crucifixion, His Burial, sacred and sad and lone, His Resurrection to life again. His glorious Ascension to Heaven's high Throne, And, lastly, his future dread And terrible coming to judge all men— Both the Living and Dead. . . . At Tara to-day I put and I place The virtue that dwells in the Seraphim's love, And the virtue and grace That are in the obedience And unshaken allegiance Of all the Archangels and angels above, And in the hope of the Resurrection To everlasting reward and election, And in the prayers of the Fathers of old, And in the truths the Prophets foretold, And in the Apostles' manifold preachings, And in the Confessors' faith and teachings, And in the purity ever dwelling Within the Immaculate Virgin's breast, And in the actions bright and excelling Of all good men, the just and the blest. . . . At Tara to-day, in this fateful hour, I place all Heaven with its power, And the sun with its brightness, And the snow with its whiteness, And fire with all the strength it hath, And lightning with its rapid wrath, And the winds with their swiftness along their path, And the sea with its deepness, And the rocks with their steepness, And the earth with its starkness, All these I place, By God's almighty help and grace, Between myself and the Powers of Darkness. At Tara to-day May God be my stay! May the strength of God now nerve me! May the power of God preserve me! May God the Almighty be near me! May God the Almighty espy me! May God the Almighty hear me! May God give me eloquent speech! May the arm of God protect me! May the wisdom of God direct me! May God give me power to teach and to preach! May the shield of God defend me! May the host of God attend me, And ward me, And guard me, Against the wiles of demons and devils, Against the temptations of vices and evils, Against the bad passions and wrathful will Of the reckless mind and the wicked heart Against every man who designs me ill, Whether leagued with others or plotting apart! In this hour of hours, I place all those powers Between myself and every foe, Who threaten my body and soul With danger or dole, To protect me against the evils that flow From lying soothsayers' incantations, From the gloomy laws of the Gentile nations, From Heresy's hateful innovations, From Idolatry's rites and invocations, Be those my defenders, My guards against every ban, And spells of smiths, and Druids, and women; In fine, against every knowledge that renders The light Heaven sends us dim in The spirit and soul of Man! May Christ, I pray, Protect me to-day Against poison and fire Against drowning and wounding, That so, in His grace abounding, I may earn the Preacher's hire! Christ, as a light, Illumine and guide me! Christ, as a shield, o'ershadow and cover me Christ be under me! Christ be over me! Christ be beside me On left hand and right! Christ be before me, behind me, about me! Christ this day be within and without me! Christ, the lowly and meek, Christ, the All-powerful, be In the heart of each to whom I speak, In the mouth of each who speaks to me! In all who draw near me, Or see or hear me! At Tara to-day, in this awful hour, I call on the Holy Trinity! Glory to Him who reigneth in power, The God of the Elements, Father and Son, And Paraclete Spirit, which Three are the One, The ever-existing Divinity! Salvation dwells with the Lord, With Christ, the Omnipotent Word. From generation to generation, Grant us, O Lord, thy grace and salvation! CEAN-SALLA. THE LAST WORDS OF RED HUGH O'DONNELL ON HIS DEPARTURE FROM IRELAND FOR SPAIN. (From the Irish.) Weep not the brave Dead! Weep rather the Living— On them lies the curse Of a doom unforgiving! Each dark hour that rolls, Shall the memories they nurse, Like molten hot lead, Burn into their souls A remorse long and sore! They have helped to enthral a Great land evermore, They who fled from Cean-Salla! Alas, for thee, slayer Of the kings of the Norsemen! Thou land of sharp swords, And strong kerns and swift horsemen! Land ringing with song! Land, whose abbots and lords, Whose Heroic and Fair, Through centuries long, Made each palace of thine A new western Walhalla— Thus to die without sign On the field of Cean-Salla; My ship cleaves the wave— I depart for Iberia— But, oh! with what grief, With how heavy and dreary a Sensation of ill! I should welcome a grave: My career has been brief, But I bow to God's will! Yet if now all forlorn, In my green years, I fall, a Long exile I mourn— But I mourn for Cean-Salla! LAMENTATION OF MAC LIAG FOR KINCORA. (From the Irish.) Oh, where, Kincora! is Brian the Great? And where is the beauty that once was thine? Oh, where are the princes and nobles that sate At the feast in thy halls, and drank the red wine? Where, oh, Kincora? Oh, where, Kincora! are thy valorous lords? Oh, whither, thou Hospitable! are they gone? Oh, where are the Dalcassians of the Golden Swords? And where are the warriors Brian led on? Where, oh, Kincora? And where is Murrough, the descendant of kings— The defeater of a hundred—the daringly brave— Who set but slight store by jewels and rings— Who swam down the torrent and laughed at its wave? Where, oh, Kincora? And where is Donogh, King Brian's worthy son? And where is Conaing, the Beautiful Chief? And Kian, and Corc? Alas! they are gone— They have left me this night alone with my grief! Left me, Kincora! And where are the chiefs with whom Brian went forth, The ne'er-vanquished son of Evin the Brave, The great King of Onaght, renowned for his worth, And the hosts of Baskinn, from the western wave? Where, oh, Kincora? Oh, where is Duvlann of the Swift-footed Steeds? And where is Kian, who was son of Molloy? And where is King Lonergan, the fame of whose deeds In the red battle-field no time can destroy? Where, oh, Kincora? And where is that youth of majestic height, The faith-keeping Prince of the Scots?—Even he, As wide as his fame was, as great as was his might, Was tributary, oh, Kincora, to thee! Thee, oh, Kincora! They are gone, those heroes of royal birth, Who plundered no churches, and broke no trust, 'Tis weary for me to be living on earth When they, oh, Kincora, lie low in the dust! Low, oh, Kincora! Oh, never again will Princes appear, To rival the Dalcassians of the Cleaving Swords! I can never dream of meeting afar or anear, In the east or the west, such heroes and lords! Never, Kincora! Oh, dear are the images my memory calls up Of Brian Boru!—how he never would miss To give me at the banquet the first bright cup! Ah! why did he heap on me honour like this? Why, oh, Kincora? I am Mac Liag, and my home is on the Lake; Thither often, to that palace whose beauty is fled, Came Brian to ask me, and I went for his sake. Oh, my grief! that I should live, and Brian be dead! Dead, oh, Kincora! THE CAPTIVITY OF THE GAELS. (From the Irish.) 'Twas by sunset . . . I walked and wandered Over hill-sides . . . and over moors, With a many sighs and tears. Sunk in sadness . . . I darkly pondered All the wrongs our . . . lost land endures In these latter night-black years. “How,” I mused, “has her worth departed! What a ruin . . . her fame is now! We, once freest of the Free, We are trampled . . . and broken-hearted; Yea, even our Princes . . . themselves must bow Low before the vile Shane Bwee!” Nigh a stream, in . . . a grassy hollow, Tired, at length, I . . . lay down to rest— There the birds and balmy air Bade new reveries . . . and cheerier follow Waking newly . . . within my breast Thoughts that cheated my despair. Was I waking . . . or was I dreaming? I glanced up, and . . . behold! there shone Such a vision over me! A young girl, bright . . . as Erin's beaming Guardian spirit—now sad and lone, Through the spoiling of Shane Bwee! O, for pencil . . . to paint the golden Locks that waved in . . . luxuriant sheen To her feet of stilly light! (Not the Fleece . . . in ages olden Jason bore o'er . . . the ocean green Into Hellas, gleamed so bright.) And the eyebrows . . . thin arched over Her mild eyes, and . . . more, even more Beautiful, methought, to see, Than those rainbows . . . that wont to hover O'er the blue island-lakes of yore Ere the spoiling by Shane Bwee! Bard!” she spake, “deem . . . not this unreal. I was niece of . . . a Pair whose peers None shall see on earth again— Æongus Con, and . . . the Dark O'Niall, Rulers over . . . Iern in years When her sons as yet were Men. Times have darkened . . . and now our holy Altars crumble, . . . and castles fall; Our groans ring through Christendee. Still, despond not! He comes, though slowly He, the Man, who shall disenthral The Proud Captive of Shane Bwee!” Here she vanished; . . . and I, in sorrow, Bent with joy, rose . . . and went my way Homeward over moor and hill. O Great God! Thou . . . from whom we borrow Life and strength, unto Thee I pray! Thou, who swayest at Thy will Hearts and councils, . . . thralls, tyrants, freemen, Wake through Europe . . . the ancient soul, And on every shore and sea, From the Blackwater to the Dniemen, Freedom's Bell will . . . ere long time toll The deep death-knell of Shane Bwee! THE SORROWS OF INNISFAIL (From the Irish of Geoffrey Keating.) Through the long drear night I lie awake, for the sorrows of Innisfail. My bleeding heart is ready to break; I cannot but weep and wail, Oh, shame and grief and wonder! her sons crouch lowly under The footstool of the paltriest foe That ever yet hath wrought them woe! How long, O mother of light and Song, how long will they fail to see That men must be bold, no less than strong, if they truly will to be free? They sit but in silent sadness, while wrongs that should rouse them to madness, Wrongs that might wake the very Dead, Are piled on thy devoted head! Thy castles, thy towers, thy palaces proud, thy stately mansions all, Are held by the knaves who crossed the waves to lord it in Brian's hall. Britannia, alas! is portress in Cobhthach's Golden Fortress, And Ulster's and Momonia's lands Are in the Robber-stranger's hands. The tribe of Eoghan is worn with woe; the O'Donnell reigns no more; O'Neill's remains lie mouldering low on Italy's far-off shore; And the youths of the Pleasant Valley are scattered and cannot rally, While foreign Despotism unfurls Its flag 'mid hordes of base-born churls. The Chieftains of Naas were valorous lords, but their valour was crushed by Craft— They fell beneath Envy's butcherly dagger and Calumny's poisoned shaft, A few of their mighty legions yet languish in alien regions, But most of them, the Frank, the Free, Were slain through Saxon perfidie! Oh! lived the Princes of Ainy's plains, and the heroes of green Domgole, And the chiefs of the Maigue, we still might hope to baffle our doom and dole, Well then might the dastards shiver who herd by the blue Bride river, But ah! those great and glorious men Shall draw no glaive on Earth again! All-powerful God! look down on the tribes who mourn throughout the land, And raise them some deliverer up, of a strong and smiting hand! Oh! suffer them not to perish, the race thou wert wont to cherish, But soon avenge their father's graves, And burst the bonds that keep them slaves! RURY AND DARVORGILLA. Know ye the tale of the Prince of Oriel, Of Rury, last of his line of kings? I pen it here as a sad memorial Of how much woe reckless folly brings. Of a time that Rury rode woodwards, clothed In silk and gold, on a hunting chase He thought like thunder on his betrothed, And with clinched hand he smote his face. “Fareer! Mabhron! Princess Darvorgilla! Forgive she will not a slight like this; But could she, dared she, I should be still a Base wretch to wed her for heaven's best bliss. “Fareer! Fareer! Princess Darvorgilla! She has four hundred young bowmen bold; But I—I love her, and would not spill a Drop of their blood for ten torques of gold. “Still, woe to all who provoke to slaughter! I count as nought, weighed with fame like mine, The birth and beauty of Cairtre's daughter; So, judge the sword between line and line! “Thou, therefore, Calbhach, go call a muster, And wind the bugle by fort and dun! When stains shall tarnish our house's lustre, Then sets in darkness the noonday sun!” But Calbhach answered—“Light need to do so! Behold the noblest of heroes here! What foe confronts us, I reck not whoso, Shall flee before us like hunted deer!” Spake Rury then—“Calbhach, as thou willest! But see, old man, there be brief delay— For this chill parle is of all things chillest, And my fleet courser must now away! “Yet though thou march with thy legions townwards, Well armed for ambush or treacherous fray, Still see they point their bare weapons downwards, As those of warriors averse to slay!” Now, when the clansmen were armed and mounted, The aged Calbhach gave way to fears; For, foot and horsemen, they barely counted A hundred cross-bows and forty spears. And thus exclaimed he—“My soul is shaken! We die the death, not of men, but slaves; We sleep the sleep from which none awaken, And scorn shall point at our tombless graves!” Then out spake Fergal—“A charge so weighty As this, O Rury, thou shouldst not throw On a drivelling dotard of eight-and-eighty, Whose arm is nerveless for spear or bow!” But Rury answered—“Away! To-morrow Myself will stand in Traghvally town; But, come what may come, this day I borrow To hunt through Glafna the brown deer down!” So, through the night, unto grey Traghvally, The feeble Ceann led his hosts along; But faint and heart-sore, they could not rally, So deeply Rury had wrought them wrong. Now, when the Princess beheld advancing Her lover's troops with their arms reversed In lieu of broadswords and chargers prancing, She felt her heart's hopes were dead and hearsed. And on her knees to her ireful father She prayed—“O father, let this pass by; War not against the brave Rury! Rather Pierce this fond bosom and let me die!” But Cairtre rose in volcanic fury, And so he spake—“By the might of God, I hold no terms with this craven Rury Till he or I lie below the sod! “Thou shameless child! Thou, alike unworthy Of him, thy father, who speaks thee thus, And her, my Mhearb, who in sorrow bore thee, Wilt thou dishonour thyself and us? “Behold! I march with my serried bowmen— Four hundred thine and a thousand mine; I march to crush these degraded foemen, Who gorge the ravens ere day decline!” Meet now both armies in mortal struggle, The spears are shivered, the javelins fly; But what strange terror, what mental juggle, Be those that speak out of Calbhach's eye? It is—it must be, some spell Satanic, That masters him and his gallant host. Woe, woe the day! An inglorious panic O'erpowers the legions—and all is lost! Woe, woe that day, and that hour of carnage! Too well they witness to Fergal's truth! Too well in bloodiest appeal they warn Age Not lightly thus to match swords with Youth! When Rury reached, in the red of morning, The battle-ground, it was he who felt The dreadful weight of this ghastly warning, And what a blow had o'ernight been dealt! So, glancing round him, and sadly groaning, He pierced his breast with his noble blade; Thus all too mournfully mis-atoning For that black ruin his word had made. But hear ye further! When Cairtre's daughter Saw what a fate had o'erta'en her Brave, Her eyes became as twin founts of water, Her heart again as a darker grave. Clasp now thy lover, unhappy maiden! But, see! thy sire tears thine arms away, And in a dungeon, all anguish laden, Shalt thou be cast ere the shut of day. But what shall be in the sad years coming Thy doom? I know not, but guess too well That sunlight never shall trace thee roaming Ayond the gloom of thy sunken cell! This is the tale of the Prince of Oriel And Darvorgilla, both sprung of Kings! I trace it here as a dark memorial Of how much woe thoughtless folly brings. THE IRISH LANGUAGE. (From the Irish of Philip Fitzgibbon.) I The language of Erin is brilliant as gold; It shines with a lustre unrivalled of old. Even glanced at by strangers to whom 'tis unknown It dazzles their eyes with a light all its own! II It is music, the sweetest of music, to hear; No lyre ever like it enchanted your ear. Not the lute, or the flute, or the quaint clarionet, For deep richness of tone could compete with it yet! III It is fire to the mind—it is wine to the heart— It is melting and bold—it is Nature and Art! Name one other language, renowned though it be, That so wakes up the soul, as the storm the deep sea! IV For its bards—there are none in cell, cottage, or hall, In the climes of the haughty Iberian and Gaul, Who despair not to match them—their marvelful tones Might have won down the gods of old Greece from their thrones! V Then it bears back your spirit on History's wings To the glories of Erin's high heroes and kings, When the proud name of Gael swelled from ocean to shore, Ere the days of the Saxon and Northman of yore. VI Is the heart of the land of this tongue undecayed? Shall the Sceptre and Sword sway again as they swayed? Shall our Kings ride in triumph o'er war-fields again, Till the sun veils his face from the hosts of the slain? VII O, then shall our halls with the Gaelic resound, In the notes of the harp and the claoirseach half-drowned, And the banquet be spread, and the chess-board all night Test the skill of our Chiefs, and their power for the fight. VIII Then our silken-robed minstrels, a silver-haired band, Shall rewake the young slumbering blood of the land, And our bards no more plaintive on Banba's dark wrongs, Shall then fill two worlds with the fame of their songs. IX And the gates of our Brughaidhs again shall stand wide, And their cead mile failte woo all withinside, And the travel-tired wayfarer find by the hearth Cheery Plenty where now, alas! all is Black Dearth. X The down-trodden Poor shall meet kindness and care, And the Rich be as happy to spare and to share! And the Mighty shall rule unassailed in their might, And all voices be blent in one choir of delight! XI The bright Golden Era that poets have sung Shall revive, and be chaunted anew in our tongue; The skies shall rain Love on the land's breadth and length, And the grain rise like armies battalioned in strength. XII The priest and the noble, the serf and his lord, Shall sustain one another with word and with sword— The Learned shall gain more than gold by their lore, And all Fate took away she shall trebly restore. XIII Like rays round a centre, like stars round the moon, Like Ocean round Earth, when it heaves in the noon, Shall our chiefs, a resplendent and panoplied ring, In invincible valour encircle their King. XIV And thou, O Grand Language, please Heaven, shalt win Proud release from the tomb thou art sepulchred in. In palace, in shieling, on highway, on hill, Shalt thou roll as a river, or glide as a rill! XV The story of Eiré shall shine forth in thee; Thou shall sound as a horn from the lips of the Free; And our priests in their forefathers' temples once more Shall through Thee call on men to rejoice and adore! WELCOME TO THE PRINCE OF OSSORY. (From the Irish of William Heffernan the Blind.) I Lift . . . up the drooping head, Meehal Dubh Mac-Giolla-Kierin! Her blood yet boundeth red Through the myriad veins of Erin. No! no! she is not dead, Meehal Dubh Mac-Giolla-Kierin! Lo! she redeems The lost years of bygone ages— New glory beams Henceforth on her History's pages! Her long penitential Night of Sorrow Yields at length before the reddening Morrow! II You . . . heard the thunder-shout, Meehal Dubh Mac-Giolla-Kierin! Saw lightning streaming out O'er the purple hills of Erin! And bide you yet in doubt, Meehal Dubh Mac-Goilla-Kierin? O! doubt no more! Through Ulidia's voiceful valleys, On . . . Shannon's shore, Freedom's burning spirit rallies, Earth and Heaven unite in sign and omen Bodeful of the downfall of our foemen. III Thurot commands the North, Meehal Dubh Mac-Giolla-Kierin! Louth sends her heroes forth To hew down the foes of Erin! Swords gleam in field and gorth, Up! up! my friend! There's a glorious goal before us; Here will we blend Speech and soul in this grand chorus— “By the Heaven that gives us one more token, We will die, or see our shackles broken!” IV Charles leaves the Grampian hills, Meehal Dubh Mac-Giolla-Kierin! Charles, whose appeal yet thrills, Like a clarion-blast, through Erin. Charles, he whose image fills Thy soul, too, Mac-Giolla-Kierin! Ten . . . thousand strong, His clans move in brilliant order, Sure that e'er long He will march them o'er the Border, While the dark-haired daughters of the Highlands Crown with wreaths the Monarch of three islands! V Fill, then, the ale-cup high, Meehal Dubh Mac-Giolla-Kierin! Fill!—the bright hour is nigh That shall give her own to Erin! Those who so sadly sigh, Even as you, Mac-Giolla-Kierin, Henceforth shall sing. Hark!—O'er heathery hill and dell come Shouts for the King! Welcome, our Deliverer! Welcome! Thousands this glad night, ere turning bedward, Will, with us, drink “Victory to Charles Edward!” LOVE BALLAD (From the Irish.) Lonely from my home I come, To cast myself upon your tomb, And to weep. Lonely from my lonesome home, My lonesome house of grief and gloom, While I keep Vigil often all night long, For your dear, dear sake. Praying many a prayer so wrong That my heart would break! Gladly, O my blighted flower, Sweet Apple of my bosom's Tree, Would I now Stretch me in your dark death-bower Beside your corpse, and lovingly Kiss your brow. But we'll meet ere many a day, Never more to part, For even now I feel the clay Gathering round my heart. In my soul doth darkness dwell, And through its dreary winter caves Ever flows, Ever flows with moaning swell, One ebbless flood of many Waves Which are Woes. Death, love, has me in his lures, But that grieves not me, So my ghost may meet with yours On yon moon-loved lea. When the neighbours near my cot Believe me sunk in slumber deep, I arise— For, O! 'tis a weary lot, This watching aye, and wooing sleep With hot eyes— I arise, and seek your grave, And pour forth my tears; While the winds that nightly rave, Whistle in mine ears. Often turns my memory back To that dear evening in the dell, When we twain Sheltered by the sloe-bush black, Sat, laughed, and talked, while thick sleet fell, And cold rain. Thanks to God! no guilty leaven Dashed our childish mirth. You rejoice for this in Heaven, I not less on earth! Love! the priests feel wroth with me, To find I shrine your image still In my breast. Since you are gone eternally, And your fair frame lies in the chill Grave at rest; But true Love outlives the shroud, Knows not check nor change, And beyond Time's world of Cloud Still must reign and range. Well may now your kindred mourn The threats, the wiles, the cruel arts, They long tried On the child they left forlorn! They broke the tenderest heart of hearts, And she died. Curse upon the love of show! Curse on Pride and Greed! They would wed you “high”—and woe! Here behold their meed! OWEN REILLY: A KEEN. (From the Irish.) I Oh! lay aside the flax, and put away the wheel, And sing with me, but not in gladness— The heart that's in my breast is like to break with sadness— God, God alone knows what I feel! II There's a lone, a vacant place beside the cheerless hearth, A spot my eyes are straining after— Oh! never more from thence will ring my boy's light laughter, The outgushing of his young heart's mirth! III No more will his hands clasp the cross before the shrine Of Christ's immaculate Virgin Mother. Never, oh! never more will he pour forth another Prayer for himself, or me, or mine! IV The young men on the mountain sides will miss—miss long, The fleetest hurler of their number. Powerless, alas! to-night in death's unbroken slumber, Lies he, the Lithe of Limb, the Strong! V Oh! raise the keen, young women, o'er my darling's grave— Oh! kneel in prayer o'er his low dwelling; At break of day this morn there knelt his mother, telling Her beads for him she could not save! VI Oh! plant, young men, the Shamrock near my darling's head, And raise the hardy fir tree over The spot: the strange wayfarer then will know they cover My Oweneen's dark burial-bed! VII Heard ye not, yestereven, the Banshee deplore His death on heath-clad Killenvallen? “Ul-ullalu!” she cried, “a green young oak is fallen, For Owen Reilly lives no more!” VIII There stands a lone grey hazel-tree in Glen-na-ree, Whose green leaves put buds forth and wither. I sigh and groan as often as I wander thither, For I am like that lone grey tree! IX My four belovèd sons, where are they? Have they not Left me a wreck here all as lonely? They withered and they died! I, their old mother, only Remain to weep and wail my lot! X But I will follow them now soon; for oft amid The storm I hear their voices calling, “Come home!”—and in my dreams I see the cold clay falling Heavily on my coffin-lid! XI When the dark night films o'er my eyes, oh! let me be Laid out by Aileen Bawn Devany; And let the lights around me at my wake be as many As the white hairs yet left to me! XII See that the tall white slender gowans blow and bloom In the grass round my head-stone brightly; I would not have the little orphan daisy nightly Mourning in solitude and gloom! XIII Let there be shrieking on the hill and in the glen, Throughout the length and breadth of Galway's Green land! Kathleen Dubh Reilly has herelf been always The Queen of Keeners; mourn her then! XIV Lights will be seen to dance along Carn Corra's height, And through the burial-field; but follow Them not, young men and women! for, o'er hill and hollow They will but lure to Death and Night! XV But come ye to my grave when, in the days of May, The gladsome sun and skies grow warmer, And say, “Here sleeps Kathleen, where tempest cannot harm her, Soft be her narrow bed of clay!” XVI And count your beads, and pray, “Rest her poor soul, O God! She willed no ill to breathing mortal— Grant her, then, Thou, a place within Heaven's blessèd portal, Now that her bones lie in the sod!” LAMENT FOR OWEN ROE O'NEILL. (From the Irish of O'Daly.) O mourn, Erin, mourn! He is lost, he is dead, By whom thy proudest flag was borne, Thy bravest heroes led! The night winds are uttering Their orison of woe, The raven flaps his darkling wing O'er the grave of Owen Roe, Of him who should have been thy King, The noble Owen Roe! Alas, hapless land, It is ever thus with thee; The eternal destinies withstand Thy struggle to be free. One after one thy champions fall, Thy valiant men lie low, And now sleeps under shroud and pall The gallant Owen Roe, The worthiest warrior of them all, The princely Owen Roe! Where was sword, where was soul Like to his beneath the skies? Ah, many a century must roll Ere such a chief shall rise! I saw him in the battle's shock, Tremendous was his blow, As smites the sledge the anvil block His blade smote the foe. He was a tower; a human rock Was mighty Owen Roe! Woe to us! Guilt and wrong Triumph, while to our grief We raise the keen, the funeral song Above our fallen chief. The proud usurper sways with power, He rules in state and show, While we lament our fallen tower, Our leader, Owen Roe: While we, like slaves, bow down and cower, And weep for Owen Roe. But the high will of Heaven Be fulfilled evermore! What tho' it leaveth us bereaven, And stricken to the core. Amid our groans, amid our tears, We still feel and know That we shall meet in after years The sainted Owen Roe: In after years, in brighter spheres, Our glorious Owen Roe! THE FAIR HILLS OF EIRÈ, O! (From the Irish of Donogh Mac-Con-Mara, or Macnamara.) Take a blessing from my heart to the land of my birth, And the fair hills of Eirè, O! And to all that yet survive of Eibhear's tribe on earth, On the fair hills of Eirè, O! In that land so delightful the wild thrush's lay Seems to pour a lament forth for Eirè's decay. Alas, alas! why pine I a thousand miles away From the fair hills of Eirè, O! The soil is rich and soft, the air is mild and bland, On the fair hills of Eirè, O! Her barest rock is greener to me than this rude land; O, the fair hills of Eirè, O! Her woods are tall and straight, grove rising over grove, Trees flourish in her glens below and on her heights above; Ah! in heart and in soul I shall ever, ever love The fair hills of Eirè, O! A noble tribe, moreover, are the now hapless Gael, On the fair hills of Eirè, O! A tribe in battle's hour unused to shrink or fail, On the fair hills of Eirè, O! For this is my lament in bitterness outpoured To see them slain or scattered by the Saxon sword; O, woe of woes! to see a foreign spoiler horde On the fair hills of Eirè, O! Broad and tall rise the cruachs in the golden morning glow On the fair hills of Eirè, O! O'er her smooth grass for ever sweet cream and honey flow On the fair hills of Eirè, O! Oh, I long, I am pining, again to behold The land that belongs to the brave Gael of old! Far dearer to my heart than a gift of gems or gold Are the fair hills of Eirè, O! The dewdrops lie bright 'mid the grass and yellow corn On the fair hills of Eirè, O! The sweet-scented apples blush redly in the morn On the fair hills of Eirè, O! The water-cress and sorrel fill the vales below, The streamlets are hushed till the evening breezes blow, While the waves of the Suir, noble river! ever flow 'Neath the fair hills of Eirè, O! A fruitful clime is Eirè, through valley, meadow, plain, And the fair hills of Eirè, O! The very bread of life is in the yellow grain On the fair hills of Eirè, O! Far dearer unto me than the tones music yields Is the lowing of the kine and the calves in her fields, In the sunlight that shone long ago on the shields Of the Gaels, on the fair hills of Eirè, O! THE GERALDINE'S DAUGHTER. (From the Irish of Egan O'Rahilly.) A beauty all stainless, a pearl of a maiden, Has plunged me in trouble, and wounded my heart; With sorrow and gloom is my soul overladen, An anguish is there that will never depart. I would voyage to Egypt across the deep water, Nor care about bidding dear Eirè farewell, So I only might gaze on the Geraldine's daughter, And sit by her side in some green, pleasant dell! Her curling locks wave round her figure of lightness, All dazzling and long, like the purest of gold; Her blue eyes resemble twin stars in their brightness, And her brow is like marble or wax to behold. The radiance of heaven illumines her features Where the snows and the rose have erected their throne; It would seem that the sun had forgotten all creatures, To shine on the Geraldine's daughter alone. Her bosom is swan-white, her waist smooth and slender; Her speech is like music, so sweet and so fair; The feelings that glow in her noble heart lend her A mien and a majesty lovely to see. Her lips, red as berries, but riper than any, Would kiss away even a sorrow like mine! No wonder such heroes and noblemen many Should cross the blue ocean to kneel at her shrine. She is sprung from the Geraldine race, the great Grecians, Niece of Mileadh's sons of the Valorous Bands, Those heroes, the seed of the olden Phœnicians, Though now trodden down, without fame, without lands; Of her ancestors flourished the Barrys and Powers, To the Lords of Bunratty she, too, is allied, And not a proud noble near Cashel's high towers But is kin to this maiden, the Geraldine's pride. Of Saxon or Gael there is none to excel in Her wisdom, her features, her figure, this fair; In all she surpasses the far-famous Helen, Whose beauty drove thousands to death and despair. Whoe'er could but gaze on her aspect so noble Would feel from thenceforward all anguish depart; Yet for me 'tis, alas! my worst woe and my trouble That her image must always abide in my heart! A LULLABY. (From the Irish of Owen Roe O'Sullivan.) O, hushaby, baby! why weepest thou? The diadem yet shall adorn thy brow, And the jewels thy sires had, long agone, In the regal ages of Eoghan and Conn, Shall all be thine. O, hushaby, hushaby, child of mine! My sorrow, my woe, to see thy tears, Pierce into my heart like spears. I'll give thee that glorious apple of gold The three fair goddesses sought of old, I'll give thee the diamond sceptre of Pan, And the rod with which Moses, that holiest man, Wrought marvels divine; O, hushaby, hushaby, child of mine! I'll give thee that courser, fleet on the plains, That courser with golden saddle and reins, Which Falvey rode, the mariner-lord, When the blood of the Danes, at Cashel-na-Nord, Flowed like to dark wine; O, hushaby, hushaby, child of mine! I'll give thee the dazzling sword was worn By Brian on Cluan-tarava's morn, And the bow of Murrough, whose shaft shot gleams That lightened as when the arrowy beams Of the noon-sun shine; O, hushaby, hushaby, child of mine! And the hound that was wont to speed amain From Cashel's rock to Bunratty's plain, And the eagle from gloomy Aherlow, And the hawk of Skellig; all these I bestow On thee and thy line; O, hushaby, hushaby, child of mine! And the golden fleece that Jason bore To Hellas' hero-peopled shore, And the steel that Cuchullin bought of yore, With cloak, and necklet, and golden store, And meadows and kine; O, hushaby, hushaby, child of mine! And Conal's unpierceable shirt of mail, And the shield of Nish, the prince of the Gael, These twain for thee, my babe, shall I win, With the flashing spears of Achilles and Finn, Each high as a pine; O, hushaby, hushaby, child of mine! And the swords of Diarmid and fierce Fingal, The slayers on heath and (alas!) in hall; And the charmèd helmet that Oscar wore When he left MacTreoin to welter in gore, Subdued and supine; O, hushaby, hushaby, child of mine! And the jewel wherewith Queen Eofa proved The value and faith of the hero she loved; The magic jewel that nerved his arm To work his enemies deadly harm On plain and on brine; O, hushaby, hushaby, child of mine! And the wondrous cloak renowned in song The enchanted cloak of the dark Dubhlong, By whose powerful aid he battled mid The thick of his foes, unseen and hid, This, too, shall be thine; O, hushaby, hushaby, child of mine! The last, not least, of thy weapons, my son, Shall be the glittering glaive of O'Dunn, The gift from Ænghus' powerful hands, The hewer-down of the Fenian bands, With edge so fine! O, hushaby, hushaby, child of mine! Even Hebe, who fills the nectar up For Love, in his luminous crystal cup, Shall pour thee out a wine in thy dreams, As bright as thy poet-father's themes When inspired by the wine; O, hushaby, hushaby, child of mine! And silken robes, and sweet, soft cates Shalt thou wear, and eat beyond thy mates— Ah, see, here comes thy mother Moirin! She, too, has the soul of an Irish queen: She scorns to repine! Then, hushaby, hushaby, child of mine! My sorrow, my woe, to see thy tears, Pierce into my heart like spears. THE RUINS OF DONEGAL CASTLE. (From the Irish.) O mournful, O forsaken pile, What desolation dost thou dree! How tarnished is the beauty that was thine erewhile, Thou mansion of chaste melody! Demolished lie thy towers and halls; A dark, unsightly, earthen mound Defaces the pure whiteness of thy shining walls, And solitude doth gird thee round. Fair fort! thine hour has come at length, Thine older glory has gone by. Lo! far beyond thy noble battlements of strength, Thy corner-stones all scattered lie! Where now, O rival of the gold Emania, be thy wine-cups all? Alas! for these thou now hast nothing but the cold, Cold stream that from the heavens doth fall! How often from thy turrets high, Thy purple turrets, have we seen Long lines of glittering ships, when summer-time drew nigh, With masts and sails of snow-white sheen! How often seen, when gazing round, From thy tall towers, the hunting trains, The blood-enlivening chase, the horseman and the hound, Thou fastness of a hundred plains! How often to thy banquets bright We have seen the strong-armed Gaels repair, And when the feast was over, once again unite For battle, in thy bass-court fair! Alas! for thee, thou fort forlorn! Alas! for thy low, lost estate! It is my woe of woes this melancholy morn, To see thee left thus desolate! Oh! there hath come of Connell's race A many and many a gallant chief, Who, if he saw thee now, thou of the once glad face Could not dissemble his deep grief. Could Manus of the lofty soul Behold thee as this day thou art, Thou of the regal towers! what bitter, bitter dole, What agony would rend his heart! He brought upon thee all this woe, Thou of the fair-proportioned walls, Lest thou shouldst ever yield a shelter to the foe, Shouldst house the black, ferocious Galls! Shouldst yet become in saddest truth A Dun-na-Gall—the strangers own. For this cause only, stronghold of the Gaelic youth, Lie thy majestic towers o'erthrown. It is a drear, a dismal sight, This of thy ruin and decay, Now that our kings, and bards, and men of mark and might, Are nameless exiles far away! Yet, better thou shouldst fall, meseems, By thine own king of many thrones, Than that the truculent Galls should rear around thy streams Dry mounds and circles of great stones. As doth in many a desperate case The surgeon by the malady, So hath, O shield and bulwark of great Coffey's race, Thy royal master done by thee! A FAREWELL TO PATRICK SARSFIELD, EARL OF LUCAN. (From the Irish.) Farewell, O Patrick Sarsfield, may luck be on your path! Your camp is broken up, your work is marred for years; But you go to kindle into flame the King of France's wrath, Though you leave sick Eirè in tears— Och, ochone! May the white sun and moon rain glory on your head, All hero as you are, and holy man of God! To you the Saxons owe a many an hour of dread In the land you have often trod— Och, ochone! The Son of Mary guard you, and bless you to the end! 'Tis altered is the time when your legions were astir, When at Cullen you were hailed as conqueror and friend, And you crossed Narrow-water, near Birr— Och, ochone! I'll journey to the north, over mount, moor, and wave; 'Twas there I first beheld drawn up, in file and line, The brilliant Irish hosts; they were bravest of the brave, But, alas, they scorned to combine— Och, ochone! I saw the royal Boyne when his billows flashed with blood; I fought at Graine Og, when a thousand horsemen fell; On the dark empurpled plain of Aughrim, too, I stood, On the plain by Tubberdonny's well— Och, ochone! To the heroes of Limerick, the city of the fights, Be my best blessing borne on the wings of the air; We had card-playing there o'er our camp fires at night, And the Word of Life, too, and prayer— Och, ochone! But for you, Londonderry, may plague smite and slay Your people, may ruin desolate you stone by stone! Thro' you there's many a gallant youth lies coffinless to-day, With the winds for mourners alone— Och, ochone! I clomb the high hill on a fair summer noon, And saw the Saxons muster, clad in armour blinding bright: Oh, rage withheld my hand, or gunsman and dragoon Should have supped with Satan that night!— Och, ochone! How many a noble soldier, how many a cavalier, Careered along this road, seven fleeting weeks ago, With silver-hilted sword, with matchlock and with spear, Who now, mavrone! lies low— Och, ochone! All hail to thee, Ben Eder! but ah, on thy brow I see a limping soldier, who battled and who bled Last year in the cause of the Stuart, though now The worthy is begging his bread— Och, ochone! And Diarmid, O Diarmid! he perished in the strife; His head it was spiked upon a halberd high; His colours they were trampled: he had no chance of life If the Lord God Himself stood by!— Och, ochone! But most, O my woe! I lament and lament For the ten valiant heroes who dwelt nigh the Nore, And my three blessed brothers; they left me and went To the wars, and returned no more— Och, ochone! On the bridge of the Boyne was our first overthrow; By Slavery the next, for we battled without rest; The third was at Aughrim. O Eirè! thy woe Is a sword in my bleeding breast— Och, ochone! Oh, the roof above our heads, it was barbarously fired, While the black Orange guns blazed and bellowed around! And as volley followed volley, Colonel Mitchel inquired Whether Lucan still stood his ground?— Och, ochone! But O'Kelly still remains, to defy and to toil, He has memories that hell won't permit him to forget, And a sword that will make the blue blood flow like oil Upon many an Aughrim yet!— Och, ochone! And I never shall believe that my fatherland can fall With the Burkes, and the Decies, and the son of Royal James, And Talbot, the captain, and Sarsfield above all, The beloved of damsels and dames— Och, ochone! THE SONG OF GLADNESS. (From the Irish of William Heffernan.) It was on a balmy evening, as June was departing fast, That alone, and meditating in grief on the times a-past, I wandered through the gloomsome shades Of bosky Aherlow, A wilderness of glens and glades, When suddenly a thrilling strain of song Broke forth upon the air in one incessant flow; Sweeter it seemed to me (both voice and word) Than harmony of the harp, or carol of the bird, For it foretold fair Freedom's triumph, and the doom of Wrong. The celestial hymns and anthems, that far o'er the sounding sea Come to Erin from the temples of bright-bosomed Italy; The music which from hill and rath The playful fairy race Pour on the wandering warrior's path, Bewildering him with wonder and delight, Or the cuckoo's full note from some green sunless place, Some sunken thicket in a stilly wood, Had less than that rich melody made mine Irish blood Bound in its veins for ecstasy, or given my soul new might! And while as I stood I listened, behold, thousand swarm of bees, All arrayed in gay gold armour, shone red through the dusky trees; I felt a boding in my soul, A truthful boding, too, That Erin's days of gloom and dole Will soon be but remembered as a dream, And the olden glory show eclipsèd by the new. Where the Usurper then be? Banished far! Where his vile hireling henchmen? Slaughtered all in war! For blood shall rill down every hill, and blacken every stream. I am Heffernan of Shronehill: my land mourns in thraldom long; And I see but one sad sight here, the weak trampled by the strong, Yet if to-morrow underneath A burial-stone I lay, Clasped in the skeleton arms of death, And if a pilgrim wind again should waft Over my noteless grave the song I heard to-day, I would spring up revivified, reborn, A living soul again, as on my birthday morn, Ay! even though coffined, over-earthed, tombed-in, and epitaphed! ROISIN DUBH. (An Earlier Version of “Dark Rosaleen”) Since last night's star, afar, afar, Heaven saw my speed; I seemed to fly o'er mountains high On magic steed. I dashed though Erne! The world may learn The cause from love: For light or sun shone on me none, But Roisin Dubh! O Roisin mine, droop not, nor pine; Look not so dull! The Pope from Rome shall send thee home A pardon full; The priests are near; O do not fear! From heaven above They come to thee, they come to free My Roisin Dubh! Thee have I loved, for thee have roved O'er land and sea; My heart was sore, and ever more It beat for thee; I could not weep, I could not sleep, I could not move! For night or day, I dreamed alway Of Roisin Dubh! Thro' Munster land, by shore and strand, Far could I roam, If I might get my loved one yet, And bring her home. O sweetest flower, that blooms in bower, Or dell or grove! Thou lovest me, and I love thee, My Roisin Dubh! The sea shall burn, the skies shall mourn, The skies rain blood, The world shall rise in dread surprise And warful mood, And hill and lake in Eirè shake, And hawk turn dove, Ere you shall pine, ere you decline, My Roisin Dubh! KATHLEEN NI HOULAHAN. (Another Version.) In vain, in vain, we turn to Spain; she heeds us not; Yet may we still, by strength of will, amend our lot; O yes! our foe shall yet lie low; our swords are drawn For her, our queen, our Caitilin Ny Uallachain! Yield not to fear, the time is near. With sword in hand We soon shall chase the Saxon race far from our land. What glory then to stand as men on field and bawn And see, all sheen, our Caitilin Ny Uallachain! How tossed, how lost, with hopes all crossed, we long have been; Our gold is gone; gear have we none, as all have seen. But ships shall brave the ocean wave, and morn shall dawn On Eirè green, on Caitilin Ny Uallachain! Let none believe that lovely Eve outworn or old; Fair is her form, her blood is warm, her heart is bold! Tho' strangers long have wrought her wrong, she will not fawn, Will not prove mean, our Caitilin Ny Uallachain! Her stately air, her flowing hair, her eyes that far Pierce thro' the gloom of Banba's doom, each like a star; Her songful voice that makes rejoice hearts grief hath gnawn, Prove her our queen, our Caitilin Ny Uallachain! We will not bear the chains we wear, not bear them long! We seem bereaven, but mighty Heaven will make us strong: The God who led thro' Ocean Red all Israel on! Will aid our queen, our Caitilin Ny Uallachain!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART II ORIGINAL POEMS RELATING TO IRELAND SOUL AND COUNTRY. Arise! my slumbering soul, arise! And learn what yet remains for thee To dree or do! The signs are flaming in the skies; A struggling world would yet be free, And live anew. The earthquake hath not yet been born, That soon shall rock the lands around Beneath their base. Immortal freedom's thunder horn, As yet, yields but a doleful sound To Europe's race. Look round, my soul, and see and say If those about thee understand Their mission here; The will to smite—the power to slay— Abound in every heart and hand, Afar, anear. But, God! must yet the conqueror's sword Pierce mind, as heart, in this proud year? O, dream it not! It sounds a false, blaspheming word, Begot and born of moral fear— And ill-begot! To leave the world a name is nought; To leave a name for glorious deeds And works of love— A name to waken lightning thought, And fire the soul of him who reads This tells above. Napoleon sinks to-day before The ungilded shrine, the single soul Of Washington; Truth's name, alone, shall man adore, Long as the waves of time shall roll Henceforward on! My countrymen! my words are weak, My health is gone, my soul is dark, My heart is chill— Yet would I fain and fondly seek To see you borne in freedom's bark O'er ocean still. Beseech your God, and bide your hour— He cannot, will not, long be dumb; Even now His tread Is heard o'er earth with coming power; And coming, trust me, it will come, Else were He dead! THE LOVELY LAND. (On a Landscape by Maclise.) Glorious birth of Mind and Colour! Gazing on thy radiant face The most lorn of Adam's race Might forget all dolour! What divinest light is beaming Over mountain, mead, and grove! That blue noontide sky above Seems asleep and dreaming. Rich Italia's wild-birds warble In the foliage of those trees, I can trace thee, Veronese, In these rocks of marble! Yet no! Mark I not where quiver The sun's rays on yonder stream? Only a Poussin's self could dream Such a sun and river! What bold imagining! Stony valley, And fair bower of eglantine! Here I see the black ravine, There the lilied alley! This is some rare clime so olden, Peopled, not by men, but fays; Some lone land of genii days, Storyful and golden! Oh! for magic power to wander One bright year through such a land! Might I even one hour stand On the blest hills yonder! But what spy I? . . . O, by noonlight! 'Tis the same!—the pillar-tower I have oft passed thrice an hour, Twilight, sunlight, moonlight! Shame to me, my own, my sire-land, Not to know thy soil and skies! Shame, that through Maclise's eyes I first see thee, Ireland! No! no land doth rank above thee Or for loveliness or worth! So shall I, from this day forth, Ever sing and love thee! A VISION OF CONNAUGHT IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY. I walked entranced Through a land of Morn; The sun, with wondrous excess of light, Shone down and glanced Over seas of corn And lustrous gardens aleft and right. Even in the clime Of resplendent Spain, Beams no such sun upon such a land; But it was the time, 'Twas in the reign, Of Cáhal Mór of the Wine-red Hand. Anon stood nigh By my side a man Of princely aspect and port sublime. Him queried I— “O, my Lord and Khan, What clime is this, and what golden time?” When he—“The clime Is a clime to praise, The clime is Erin's, the green and bland; And it is the time, These be the days, Of Cáhal Mór of the Wine-red Hand!” Then saw I thrones, And circling fires, And a Dome rose near me, as by a spell, Whence flowed the tones Of silver lyres, And many voices in wreathèd swell; And their thrilling chime Fell on mine ears As the heavenly hymn of an angel-band— “It is now the time, These be the years, Of Cáhal Mór of the Wine-red Hand!” I sought the hall, And, behold!—a change From light to darkness, from joy to woe! King, nobles, all, Looked aghast and strange; The minstrel-group sate in dumbest show! Had some great crime Wrought this dread amaze, This terror? None seemed to understand 'Twas then the time, We were in the days, Of Cáhal Mór of the Wine-red Hand. I again walked forth; But lo! the sky Showed fleckt with blood, and an alien sun Glared from the north, And there stood on high, Amid his shorn beams, a skeleton! It was by the stream Of the castled Maine, One Autumn eve, in the Teuton's land, That I dreamed this dream Of the time and reign Of Cáhal Mór of the Wine-red Hand! THE WARNING VOICE. Ye Faithful—ye noble! A day is at hand Of trial and trouble, And woe in the land! O'er a once greenest path, Now blasted and sterile, Its dusk shadows loom— It cometh with Wrath, With Conflict and Peril, With Judgment and Doom! False bands shall be broken, Dead systems shall crumble, And the haughty shall hear Truths never yet spoken, Though smouldering like flame Through many a lost year In the hearts of the Humble; For hope will expire As the terror draws nigher, And, with it, the Shame Which so long overawed Men's minds by its might— And the Powers abroad Will be Panic and Blight, And phrenetic Sorrow— Black Pest all the night, And Death on the morrow! Now, therefore, ye True, Gird your loins up anew! By the good you have wrought? By all you have thought, And suffered, and done! By your souls! I implore you, Be leal to your mission— Remembering that one Of the two paths before you Slopes down to Perdition! To you have been given, Not granaries and gold, But the Love that lives long, And waxes not cold; And the Zeal that has striven Against Error and Wrong, And in fragments had riven The chains of the strong! Bide now, by your sternest Conceptions of earnest Endurance for others, Your weaker-souled brothers! Your true faith and worth Will be History soon, And their stature stand forth In the unsparing Noon! You have dreamed of an era Of Knowledge, and Truth, And Peace—the true glory! Was this a chimera? Not so!—but the childhood and youth Of our days will grow hoary, Before such a marvel shall burst on their sight! On you its beams glow not— For you its flowers blow not, You cannot rejoice in its light, But in darkness and suffering instead, You go down to the place of the Dead! To this generation The sore tribulation, The stormy commotion, And foam of the Popular Ocean, The struggle of class against class; The Dearth and the Sadness, The Sword and the War-vest; To the next, the Repose and the Gladness, “The Sea of clear glass,” And the rich Golden Harvest. Know, then, your true lot, Ye faithful, though few! Understand your position, Remember your mission, And vacillate not, Whatsoever ensue! Alter not! Falter not! Palter not now with your own living souls, When each moment that rolls May see Death lay his hand On some new victim's brow! Oh! let not your vow Have been written in sand! Leave cold calculations, Of Danger and Plague, To the slaves and the traitors Who cannot dissemble The dastard sensations That now make them tremble With phantasies vague!— The men without ruth— The hypocrite haters Of Goodness and Truth, Who at heart curse the race Of the sun through the skies; And would look in God's face With a lie in their eyes! To the last do your duty, Still mindful of this— That Virtue is Beauty, And Wisdom, and Bliss; So, howe'er, as frail men, you have erred on Your way along Life's throngèd road, Shall your consciences prove a sure guerdon And tower of defence, Until Destiny summon you hence To the Better Abode! A VOICE OF ENCOURAGEMENT—A NEW YEAR'S LAY. Youths! Compatriots! Friends! Men for the time that is nearing! Spirits appointed by Heaven to front the storm and the trouble! You, who in seasons of peril, unfaltering still and unfearing, Calmly have held on your course, the course of the Just and the Noble! You, young men, would a man unworthy to rank in your number, Yet with a heart that bleeds for his country's wrongs and affliction, Fain raise a voice to, in song, albeit his music and diction Rather be fitted, alas! to lull to, than startle from, slumber. Friends! the gloom in our land, in our once bright land, grows deeper. Suffering, even to death, in its horriblest forms, aboundeth; Thro' our black harvestless fields, the peasants' faint wail resoundeth. Hark to it, even now! . . . The nightmare oppressèd sleeper Gasping and struggling for life, beneath his hideous bestrider, Sëeth not, drëeth not, sight or terror more fearful or ghastly Than that poor paralysed slave! Want, Houselessness, Famine, and lastly Death in a thousand-corpsed grave, that momently waxeth wider. Worse! The great heart of the country is thrilled and throbbeth but faintly! Apathy palsieth here—and there, a panic misgiving: Even the Trustful and Firm, even the Sage and the Saintly, Seem to believe that the Dead but foreshow the doom of the Living. Men of the faithfullest souls all but broken-hearted O'er the dishonoured tombs of the glorious dreams that have perished— Dreams that almost outshone Realities while they were cherished— All, they exclaim, is gone! The Vision and Hope have departed! Worst and saddest! As under Milton's lowermost Tophet Yawned another yet lower, so for the mourning Million Still is there deeper woe! Patriot, Orator, Prophet, Some who a few years agone stood proudly in the Pavilion Of their land's rights and liberties, gazing abroad thro' its casement On the fair Future they fondly deemed at hand for their nation, Now not alone succumb to the change and the Degradation, But have ceased even to feel them! God! this indeed is abasement! Is the last hope then gone? Must we lie down despairing? No! there is always hope for all who will dare and suffer; Hope for all who surmount the Hill of Exertion, uncaring Whether their path be brighter or darker, smoother or rougher; No! there is always hope for those who, relying with earnest Souls on God and themselves, take for their motto, “Labour.” Such see the rainbow's glory where Heaven looms darkest and sternest; Such in the storm-wind hear but the music of pipe and tabor. Follow your destiny up! Work! Write! Preach to arouse and Warn, and watch, and encourage! Dangers, no doubt, surround you— But for Ten threatening you now, you will soon be appalled by a Thousand If you forsake the course to which Virtue and Honour have bound you! Oh, persevere! persevere! Falter not!—faint not!—shrink not! Hate and Hostility serve but as spurs to the will of the Zealous— Tho' your foes flourish awhile, and you seem to decline, be not jealous, “Help from the Son of Man cometh in such an hour as you think not!” Slavery debases the soul; yea! reverses its primal nature; Long were our fathers bowed to the earth with fetters of iron— And, alas! we inherit the failings and ills that environ Slaves like a dungeon wall and dwarf their original stature. Look on your countrymen's failings with less of anger than pity; Even with the faults of the evil deal in a manner half tender; And like an army encamped before a beleaguered city, Earlier or later you must compel your foes to surrender! Lo, a new year! A year into whose bosom Time gathers All the past lessons of ages—a mournful but truth-teaching muster; All the rich thoughts and deeds, and the marvellous lore of our fathers; All the sunlike experience that makes men wiser and juster. Hail it with steadfast resolve—thankfully, if it befriend you; Guardedly, lest it betray—without either Despair or Elation, Panoplied inly against the sharpest ills it may send you, But with a high hope still for yourselves and the Rise of your Nation. Omen full, archèd with gloom and laden with many a presage, Many a portent of woe, looms the Impending Era Not as of old, by comet—sword, Gorgon, or ghastly Chimera, Scarcely by lightning and thunder, Heaven to-day sends its message. Into the secret heart—down thro' the caves of the spirit, Pierces the silent shaft—sinks the invisible token— Cloaked in the Hall, the Envoy stands, his mission unspoken, While the pale, banquetless guests await in trembling to hear it. A HIGHWAY FOR FREEDOM. Air—“Boyne Water.” I “My suffering country shall be freed, And shine with tenfold glory!” So spake the gallant Winkelried, Renowned in German story. “No tyrant, even of kingly grade, Shall cross or darken my way!” Out flashed his blade, and so he made For Freedom's course a highway! II We want a man like this, with pow'r To rouse the world by one word; We want a chief to meet the hour, And march the masses onward. But, chief or none, through blood and fire, My fatherland, lies thy way! The men must fight who dare desire For Freedom's course a highway! III Alas! I can but idly gaze Around in grief and wonder, The people's will alone can raise The people's shout of thunder. Too long, my friends, you faint for fear, In secret crypt and by-way; At last be men! Stand forth and clear For Freedom's course a highway! IV You intersect wood, lea, and lawn, With roads for monster waggons, Wherein you speed like lightning drawn By fiery iron dragons. So do. Such work is good, no doubt; But why not seek some nigh way For mind as well? Path also out For Freedom's course a highway. V Yes! up! and let your weapons be Sharp steel and self-reliance! Why waste your burning energy In void and vain defiance, And phrases fierce but fugitive? 'Tis deeds, not words, that I weigh— Your swords and guns alone can give To Freedom's course a highway! IRISH NATIONAL HYMN. O Ireland! Ancient Ireland! Ancient! yet for ever young! Thou our mother, home and sire-land— Thou at length hast found a tongue— Proudly thou, at length, Resistest in triumphant strength. Thy flag of freedom floats unfurled; And as that mighty God existeth, Who giveth victory when and where He listeth, Thou yet shalt wake and shake the nations of the world. For this dull world still slumbers, Weetless of its wants or loves, Though, like Galileo, numbers Cry aloud, “It moves! it moves!” In a midnight dream, Drifts it down Time's wreckful stream— All march, but few descry the goal. O Ireland! be it thy high duty To teach the world the might of Moral Beauty, And stamp God's image truly on the struggling soul. Strong in thy self-reliance, Not in idle threat or boast, Hast thou hurled thy fierce defiance At the haughty Saxon host, Thou hast claimed, in sight Of high Heaven, thy long-lost right. Upon thy hills—along thy plains— In the green bosom of thy valleys, The new-born soul of holy freedom rallies, And calls on thee to trample down in dust thy chains! Deep, saith the Eastern story, Burns in Iran's mines a gem, For its dazzling hues and glory Worth a Sultan's diadem. But from human eyes, Hidden there it ever lies! The aye-travailing Gnomes alone, Who toil to form the mountain's treasure, May gaze and gloat with pleasure, without measure, Upon the lustrous beauty of that wonder-stone. So is it with a nation, Which would win for its rich dower That bright pearl, Self-liberation— It must labour hour by hour. Strangers who travail To lay bare the gem, shall fail; Within itself must grow, must glow— Within the depth of its own bosom, Must flower in loving might, must broadly blossom, The hopes that shall be born ere Freedom's Tree can blow Go on, then, all rejoiceful! March on thy career unbowed! Ireland! let thy noble, voiceful Spirit cry to God aloud! Man will bid thee speed— God will aid thee in thy need— The Time, the Hour, the Power are near— Be sure thou soon shalt form the vanguard Of that illustrious band, whom Heaven and Man guard: And these words come from one whom some have called a Seer. TO MY NATIVE LAND. Awake! arise! shake off thy dreams! Thou art not what thou wert of yore: Of all those rich, those dazzling beams, That once illum'd thine aspect o'er Show me a solitary one Whose glory is not quenched and gone. The harp remaineth where it fell, With mouldering frame and broken chord; Around the song there hangs no spell— No laurel wreath entwines the sword; And startlingly the footstep falls Along thy dim and dreary halls. When other men in future years, In wonder ask, how this could be? Then answer only by thy tears, That ruin fell on thine and thee; Because thyself wouldst have it so— Because thou welcomedst the blow! To stamp dishonour on thy brow Was not within the power of earth; And art thou agonised, when now The hour that lost thee all thy worth, And turned thee to the thing thou art, Rushes upon thy bleeding heart? Weep, weep, degraded one—the deed, The desperate deed was all thine own: Thou madest more than maniac speed To hurl thine honours from their throne. Thine honours fell, and when they fell The nations rang thy funeral knell. Well may thy sons be seared in soul, Their groans be deep by night and day; Till day and night forget to roll, Their noblest hopes shall morn decay— Their freshest flowers shall die by blight— Their brightest sun shall set at night. The stranger, as he treads thy sod, And views thy universal wreck, May execrate the foot that trod Triumphant on a prostrate neck; But what is that to thee? Thy woes May hope in vain for pause or close. Awake! arise! shake off thy dreams! 'Tis idle all to talk of power, And fame and glory—these are themes Befitting ill so dark an hour; Till miracles be wrought for thee, Nor fame nor glory shalt thou see. Thou art forsaken by the earth, Which makes a byword of thy name; Nations, and thrones, and powers whose birth As yet is not, shall rise to fame, Shall flourish and may fall—but thou Shalt linger as thou lingerest now. And till all earthly power shall wane, And Time's grey pillar, groaning, fall; Thus shall it be, and still in vain Thou shalt essay to burst the thrall Which binds, in fetters forged by fate, The wreck and ruin of what once was great. THE PEAL OF ANOTHER TRUMPET. “Irlande, Irlande, rejouis toi! Pour toi l'heure de vengeance est sonné. Ton tribun prepare ta deliverance.” —From the “Derniers Mots” of Mdlle. Lenormand, the celebrated French Pythoness. I. Youths of Ireland, patriots, friends! Know ye what shall be your course When the storm that now impends Shall come down in all its force? Glance around you! You behold How the horizon of the Time Hourly wears a duskier hue, From all else await we bold Bearing, and Resolve sublime— Youths of Ireland, what from you? II. Will you bide irresolute? Will you stand with folded arms, Purposeless, disheartened, mute, As men hopeless of escape, Till the wildest, worst alarms Of your souls take giant shape? Are you dastards? Are you dolts? Irishmen! shall you be seen With white lips and faltering mien, When all on earth, when heaven above, Torn by thousand thunderbolts, Rocks and reels which way you move? III. Oh, no! no! forfend it, Heaven! Such debasement cannot be! Pillaged of your liberty, You are not as yet bereaven Of that heritage of bravery Which descends to you through ages, And ennobles all—save slavery. Yours, thank God, are manhood still, And the inborn strength of soul, Which nought outward can control, And the headlong chariot—Will, Ever-bounding, never-bending, Which alike with Sword or Song, As befits the season, wages Unrelenting war with Wrong— Unrelenting and unending. IV. Gentler gifts are yours, no less, Tolerance of the faults of others, Love of mankind as your brothers, Generous Pity, Tenderness, Soul-felt sympathy with grief: The warm heart, the winged hand, Whereso suffering craves relief. Through all regions hath your fame For such virtues long gone forth. The swart slave of Kaffirland, The frozen denizen of the North, The dusk Indian Mingo chief In his lone savannahs green, The wild, wandering Beddaween Mid his wastes of sand and flame; All have heard how, unsubdued By long centuries of sorrow, You still cherish in your bosoms The deep Love no wrongs can slay, And the Hopes which, crushed to-day, Rear their crests afresh, renewed, In immortal youth, to-morrow, Like the Spring's rejoicing blossoms. V. And 'tis well you thus can blend Softest moods of mind with sternest— Well you thus can temper earnest Might with more than Feminine meekness, Thus can soar and thus descend; For even now the wail of Want, The despairing cry of Weakness, Rings throughout a stricken land, And blood-blackening Plague and gaunt Famine roam it hand-in-hand! To you, now, the millions turn With glazed eyes and lips that burn— To you lies their last appeal, To your hearts—your feelings—reason! Oh, stretch forth your hands in season! Soothe and solace—help and heal! Rich in blessings, bright with beauty, Shine their names throughout all æons, Theirs who nobly consecrate To self-sacrificing Duty Their best years—the new St. Leons, Who thus conquer Time and Fate! VI. But for more, far more, than this, Youths of Ireland, stand prepared! Revolution's red abyss Burns beneath us, all but bared— And on high the fire-charged Cloud Blackens in the firmament, And afar we list the loud Sea-voice of the unknown Event. Youths of Ireland, stand prepared! For all woes the Meek have dree'd, For all risks the Brave have dared, As for suffering, so for Deed, Stand prepared! For the Pestilence that striketh Where it listeth, whom it liketh, For the Blight whose deadly might Desolateth day and night— For a Sword that never spared Stand prepared! Though that gory Sword be bared Be not scared! Do not blench and dare not falter! For the axe and for the halter Stand prepared! And give God the glory If, whene'er the Wreath of Story Swathe your names, the men whose hands Brightly twine it, May enshrine it In one temple with your lands! HYMN FOR PENTECOST. Pure Spirit of the alway-faithful God, Kindler of Heaven's true light within the soul! From the lorn land our sainted fathers trod, Ascends to Thee our cry of hope and dole. Thee, Thee we praise! To Thee we raise Our choral hymn in these awakening days: O, send us down anew that fire Which of old lived in David's and Isaiah's lyre. Centuries had rolled, and earth lay tombed in sleep, The nightmare sleep of nations beneath kings; And far abroad o'er liberty's great deep Death's angel waved his black and stilling wings. Then struck Thine hour! Thou, in Thy power, But breathedst, and the free stood up, a tower; And tyranny's thrones and strongholds fell, And men made jubilee for an abolished hell. And she, our mother-house, the famed, the fair, The golden house of light and intellect, Must she still groan in her intense despair? Shall she lie prone while Europe stands erect? Forfend this, Thou To Whom we vow Souls even our giant wrongs shall never bow: Thou wilt not leave our green flag furled, Nor bear that we abide the byword of the world. Like the last lamp that burned in Tullia's tomb Through ages, vainly, with unwaning ray, Our star of Hope lights but a path of gloom, Whose false track leads us round and round alway. But Thou canst ope A gate from hope To victory! Thou canst nerve our arms to cope With looming storm and danger still, And lend a thunder-voice to the land's lightning-will. Descend, then, Spirit of the Eternal King! To thee, to Him, to His avenging Son, The Divine God, in boundless trust we cling; His help once ours, our nationhood is won. We watch the time Till that sublime Event shall thrill the free of every clime. Speed, mighty Spirit! speed its march, And thus complete for earth mankind's triumphal arch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART III ORIGINAL POEMS-PERSONAL AND MISCELLANEOUS TO JOSEPH BRENAN. A REPLY. Friend and brother, and yet more than brother, Thou endowed with all of Shelley's soul! Thou whose heart so burneth for thy mother, That, like his, it may defy all other Flames, while time shall roll! Thou of language bland, and manner meekest, Gentle bearing, yet unswerving will— Gladly, gladly, list I when thou speakest, Honoured highly is the man thou seekest To redeem from ill! Truly showest thou me the one thing needful! Thou art not, nor is the world yet blind. Truly have I been long years unheedful Of the thorns and tares, that choked the weedful Garden of my mind! Thorns and tares, which rose in rank profusion Round my scanty fruitage and my flowers, Till I almost deemed it self-delusion, Any attempt or glance at their extrusion From their midnight bowers. Dream and waking life have now been blended Longtime in the caverns of my soul— Oft in daylight have my steps descended Down to that dusk realm where all is ended, Save remeadless dole! Oft, with tears, I have groaned to God for pity— Oft gone wandering till my way grew dim— Oft sung unto Him a prayerful ditty— Oft, all lonely in this throngful city Raised my soul to Him! And from path to path His mercy tracked me— From a many a peril snatched He me, When false friends, pursued, betrayed, attacked me, When gloom overdarked, and sickness racked me, He was by to save and free! Friend! thou warnest me in truly noble Thoughts and phrases! I will heed thee well— Well will I obey thy mystic double Counsel, through all scenes of woe and trouble, As a magic spell! Yes! to live a bard, in thought and feeling! Yes! to act my rhyme, by self-restraint, This is truth's, is reason's deep revealing, Unto me from thee, as God's to a kneeling And entranced saint! Fare thee well! we now know each the other, Each has struck the other's inmost chords— Fare thee well, my friend and more than brother, And may scorn pursue me if I smother In my soul thy words! THE DYING ENTHUSIAST. BALLAD. Speak no more of life, What can life bestow, In this amphitheatre of strife, All times dark with tragedy and woe? Knowest thou not how care and pain Build their lampless dwelling in the brain, Ever, as the stern intrusion Of our teachers, time and truth, Turn to gloom the bright illusion, Rainbowed on the soul of youth? Could I live to find that this is so? Oh! no! no! As the stream of time Sluggishly doth flow, Look how all of beaming and sublime, Sinks into the black abysm below. Yea, the loftiest intellect, Earliest on the strand of life is wrecked. Nought of lovely, nothing glorious, Lives to triumph o'er decay; Desolation reigns victorious— Mind is dungeon-walled by clay; Could I bear to feel mine own laid low? Oh! no! no! Restless o'er the earth Thronging millions go: But behold how genius, love, and worth, Move like lonely phantoms to and fro. Suns are quenched, and kingdoms fall, But the doom of these outdarkens all! Die they then? Yes, love's devotion, Stricken, withers in its bloom; Fond affections, deep as ocean, In their cradle find their tomb: Shall I linger, then, to count each throe? Oh! no! no! Prison-bursting death! Welcome be thy blow! Thine is but the forfeit of my breath, Not the spirit! nor the spirit's glow. Spheres of beauty—hallowed spheres, Undefaced by time, undimmed by tears, Henceforth hail! oh, who would grovel, In a world, impure as this? Who would weep, in cell or hovel, When a palace might be his? Wouldst thou have me the bright lot forego? Oh! no! no! THE NAMELESS ONE. BALLAD. Roll forth, my song, like the rushing river, That sweeps along to the mighty sea; God will inspire me while I deliver My soul of thee! Tell thou the world, when my bones lie whitening Amid the last homes of youth and eld, That there was once one whose veins ran lightning No eye beheld. Tell how his boyhood was one drear night-hour, How shone for him, through his griefs and gloom, No star of all heaven sends to light our Path to the tomb. Roll on, my song, and to after ages Tell how, disdaining all earth can give, He would have taught men, from wisdom's pages, The way to live. And tell how trampled, derided, hated, And worn by weakness, disease, and wrong, He fled for shelter to God, who mated His soul with song— With song which alway, sublime or vapid, Flowed like a rill in the morning beam, Perchance not deep, but intense and rapid— A mountain stream. Tell how this Nameless, condemned for years long To herd with demons from hell beneath, Saw things that made him, with groans and tears, long For even death. Go on to tell how, with genius wasted, Betrayed in friendship, befooled in love, With spirit shipwrecked, and young hopes blasted, He still, still strove. Till, spent with toil, dreeing death for others, And some whose hands should have wrought for him (If children live not for sires and mothers,) His mind grew dim. And he fell far through that pit abysmal The gulf and grave of Maginn and Burns, And pawned his soul for the devil's dismal Stock of returns. But yet redeemed it in days of darkness, And shapes and signs of the final wrath, When death, in hideous and ghastly starkness, Stood on his path. And tell how now, amid wreck and sorrow, And want, and sickness, and houseless nights, He bides in calmness the silent morrow, That no ray lights. And lives he still, then? Yes! Old and hoary At thirty-nine, from despair and woe, He lives enduring what future story Will never know. Him grant a grave to, ye pitying noble, Deep in your bosoms! There let him dwell! He, too, had tears for all souls in trouble, Here and in hell. THE ONE MYSTERY. BALLAD. 'Tis idle! we exhaust and squander The glittering mine of thought in vain; All-baffled reason cannot wander Beyond her chain. The flood of life runs dark—dark clouds Make lampless night around its shore: The dead, where are they? In their shrouds— Man knows no more. Evoke the ancient and the past, Will one illumining star arise? Or must the film, from first to last, O'erspread thine eyes? When life, love, glory, beauty, wither, Will wisdom's page, or science' chart, Map out for thee the region whither Their shades depart? Supposest thou the wondrous powers, To high imagination given, Pale types of what shall yet be ours, When earth is heaven? When this decaying shell is cold, Oh! sayest thou the soul shall climb That magic mount she trod of old, Ere childhood's time? And shall the sacred pulse that thrilled, Thrill once again to glory's name? And shall the conquering love that filled All earth with flame, Reborn, revived, renewed, immortal, Resume his reign in prouder might, A sun beyond the ebon portal Of death and night? No more, no more—with aching brow And restless heart, and burning brain, We ask the When, the Where, the How, And ask in vain. And all philosophy, all faith, All earthly—all celestial lore, Have but one voice, which only saith— Endure—adore! A BROKEN-HEARTED LAY. Weep for one blank, one desert epoch in The history of the heart; it is the time When all which dazzled us no more can win; When all that beamed of starlike and sublime Wanes, and we stand lone mourners o'er the burial Of perished pleasure, and a pall funereal, Stretching afar across the hueless heaven, Curtains the kingly glory of the sun, And robes the melancholy earth in one Wide gloom: when friends for whom we could have striven With pain, and peril, and the sword, and given Myriads of lives, had such been merged in ours, Requite us with falseheartedness and wrong; When sorrows haunt our path like evil powers, Sweeping and countless as the legion throng. Then, when the upbroken dreams of boyhood's span, And when the inanity of all things human, And when the dark ingratitude of man, And when the hollower perfidy of woman, Come down like night upon the feelings, turning This rich, bright world, so redolent of bloom, Into a lazar-house of tears and mourning— Into the semblance of a living tomb! When, yielding to the might she cannot master, The soul forsakes her palace halls of youth, And (touched by the Ithuriel wand of truth, Which oft in one brief hour works wonders vaster Than those of Egypt's old magician host) Sees at a single glance that all is lost! And brooding in her cold and desolate lair Over the phantom-wreck of things that were, And asking destiny if nought remain? Is answered—bitterness and life-long pain, Remembrance, and reflection, and despair, And torturing thoughts that will not be forbidden, And agonies that cannot all be hidden! THE GROANS OF DESPAIR. Oh no, my friend! I abide unseen— You paint your home as left forlorn?— Yet ask not me to meet you more, This heart of mine, once gay and green, Far more than yours is now outworn, And feels as 'twere one cancered sore; I walk alone in trouble Revolving thoughts of gloom, Each passing day doth but redouble The miseries of my doom! In trouble? Oh, how weak a word!— In woe, in horror, let me say— In wretchedness without a name! The wrath of God, the avenging sword Of Heav'n burns in my breast alway, With ever freshly torturing flame! And desolateness and terror Have made me their dark mate— The ghastly brood of sin and error Repented all—Too Late I see black dragons mount the sky, I see earth yawn beneath my feet— I feel within the asp, the worm That will not sleep and cannot die, Fair though may show the winding sheet! I hear all night, as through a storm, Hoarse voices calling, calling My name upon the wind— All omens, monstrous and appalling, Affright my guilty mind. I exult alone in one wild hour, That hour in which the red cup drowns The memories it anon renews In ghastlier guise, in fiercer power— Then Fancy brings me golden crowns, And visions of all brilliant hues Lap my lost soul in gladness, Until I awake again, And the dark lava-fires of madness Once more sweep through my brain! You tell me truth may win me back— Alas! your words but pierce like spears! Alas! my hopes lie long inurned! The gone is gone—man cannot track Afresh his course of blasted years, Or bid flowers bloom where fires have burned. Such flowers bloomed once around me, But those are dead!—all—all! And now the fiends who've bound me Hold me in hopeless thrall! In those resplendent years of Youth When virtue seems the true romance, And naught else lures the generous mind, I might, even had I strayed from Truth, Have yet retrieved my road perchance, And left mine errors far behind— But return now?—oh, never, Never, and never more! Truth's holy fire is quenched for ever Within my bosom's core! Farewell! my friend. For you fair hope Still smiles—though lone, you still are free. But, for myself, I nightly die— In dreams I see that black gate ope That shows my future doom to me In pictured forms that cannot lie! Farewell! forget my story, I live beneath a ban: But to the all-wise God be glory, Whate'er becomes of Man! DISASTER. I knew that Disaster Would shadow thy morning, and must; The fair alabaster Is easily trampled to dust. If the bright lake lay stilly When whirlwinds rose to deform, If the life of the lily Were charmed against every storm, Thou mightest, though human, Have smiled through the saddest of years— Thou mightest, though Woman, Have lived unacquainted with tears. Weep, hapless forsaken! In my lyrical art I can find No spell that may waken The glow of young hope in thy mind. Weep, fairest and frailest! Since bitter, though fruitless, regret For the loss thou bewailest Hath power to win tears from thee yet; Weep, while from their fountain Those drops of affliction can roll— The snows on the mountain Will soon be less cold than thy soul. Not always shall Sorrow As a scimitar pierce to thy core; There cometh a morrow When its tyranny daunteth no more; Chill Habitude, steeling The breast, consecrates it to Pride, And the current of Feeling Is locked like a firm winter-tide, And the stricken heart pillows Itself in repose upon Pain, And cares roll in billows O'er the hull of the soul still in vain. But the crumbling palace Is lovely through ruin and ill, And the wineless chalice Sheds light on the banquet still; And as odours of glory Exhale from the patriot's shroud, As the mountain, though hoary And barren, still kisses the cloud, So may thine affections Live on, though their fervour be past, And the heart's recollections May hallow their shrine to the last! POMPEII. The heralds of thy ruin and despair Thickened and quickened as thy time drew nigh. What prodigies of sound convulsed the air! How many a death-flag was unfurled on high! The sullen sun went down—a globe of blood, Rayless, and colouring every heart with gloom, Till even the dullest felt and understood The coming of an overwhelming doom— The presage of a destiny and fall, A shock, a thunder-shock, for thee, for them—for all. The sullen sun went down—a globe of blood, Rayless, and colouring every soul with gloom; And men's imagination, prone to brood Over the worst, and summon from the womb Of unborn Time, the Evil and the Dark, Launched forth in fear upon that shoreless ocean, Whose whirlpool billows but engulf the bark— Conjectured Dread, and each fresh-felt emotion, Like spectral figures on a magic mirror, Seemed wilder than the last, and stronglier strung with terror. We shrink within ourselves when Night and Storm Are darkly mustering; for, to every soul Heaven here foreshadows character and form Of Nature's death-hour. Doth the thunder roll, The wild wave boil, the lightning stream or strike, Flood, fire, and earthquake devastate, in vain? Or is there not a voice which peals alike To all from these, conjuring up that train Of scenes and images that shall be born In living, naked might upon the Judgment morn? If thus we cower to tempest and to night, How feltest thou when first the red bolt broke, That seventeen suffocating centuries might Enshroud thine ashes in Time's midnight cloak? Where wert thou in that moment? Was thy power All a funeral phantom? Thy renown An echo? Thine the triumph of an hour? Enough!—I rave—when empires, worlds, go down Time's wave to dissolution—when they bow To Fate, let none ask where, but simply—what wert thou? The desolated cities which of yore Perished by flooding fire and sulphury rain, Where sleeps the Dead Sea's immemorial shore, Lie, blasted wrecks, below that mortar plain. They fell—thou fellest—but, renounced of Earth, Blotted from being to eternal years, Their image chills the life-blood—thine gives birth, Even while we shudder, to some human tears. Hadst thou less guilt? Who knows? The book of Time Bears on each leaf alike the broad red stamp of crime. TO LAURA. “ADDIO LA VITA DELLA VITA!” The life of life is gone and over; I live, to feel I live in vain, And worlds were worthless to recover That dazzling dream of mine again. The idol I adored is broken, And I may weep its overthrow; Thy lips at length my doom have spoken, And all that now remains is woe. And is it thus indeed we sever? And hast thou then forgotten all? And canst thou cast me off for ever, To mourn my dark and hopeless thrall? Oh, Perfidy! in friend or foe, In stranger, lover, husband, wife, Thou art the blackest drop of woe That bubbles in the Cup of Life! But most and worst in Woman's breast, Triumphant in thy blasting power, Thou reignest like a demon-guest Enthroned in some celestial bower! Oh! cold and cruel she who, while She lavishes all wiles to win Her lover o'er, can smile and smile, Yet be all dark and false within! Who, when his glances on another Too idly and too long have dwelt, Can sigh, as though she strove to smother The grief her bosom never felt! Who, versed in every witching art That even the warmest love would dare, First having gained her victim's heart, Then turns him over to despair! Alas! and can this treachery be? The worm that winds in slime along Is less contemptible than she Who revels in such heartless wrong! Go, thou, exulting in thy guilt, And weave thy wanton web anew! Go, false as fair, and, if thou wilt, Again betray the Fond and True! Yet learn that this, my last farewell, Is less in anger than in sorrow; Mine is the tale that myriads tell Who loathe to-day, and dread to-morrow. Me, Laura, me thou never knewest, Nor sawest that if my speech was cold, The love is deepest oft and truest That burns within the breast untold. My soul was formed for Love and Grief— These both were blended at my birth, But lifeless as a shrivelled leaf Lie now my dearest hopes on earth. I sigh—where none my sighs return, I love, but am not loved again; Till life be past this heart must burn, With none to soothe or share its pain. Adieu! In Pleasure's giddy whirl Soon wilt thou have forgotten me, But where, oh, too-dissembling girl, Shall I from thy dear image flee? Adieu! for thee the heavens are bright; Bright flowers along thy pathway lie; The bolts that strike, the winds that blight, Will pass thy Bower of Beauty by; But when shall rest be mine? Alas! When first the winter winds shall wave The pale wild-flowers and long dark grass Above mine unremembered grave. LINES ON THE DEATH OF A BELOVED FRIEND. I stood aloof: I dared not to behold Thy relics covered over with the mould; I shed no tear—I uttered not a groan, But oh! I felt heart-broken and alone! How feel I now? The bitterness of grief Has passed, for all that is intense is brief— A softer sadness overshades my mind, But there thine image ever lies enshrined. And if I mourn—for this is human, too— I mourn no longer that thy days were few, Nor that thou hast escaped the tears and woe, And deaths on deaths the Living undergo. Thou fadedst in the Spring-time of thine years— Life's juggling joys and spirit-wasting fears Thou knewest but in romance—and to thine eyes Man shone a god—the earth a Paradise! Thou diedst ere the icy breath of Scorn Froze the warm feelings of thy girlhood's morn— Ere thou couldst learn that Man is but a slave, And this blank world a prison and a grave. Thy spirit is at peace—Peace! blessèd word! Forgotten by the million—or unheard; But mine still struggles down this Vale of Death, And courts the favour of a little breath! Through every stage of Life's consuming fever The soul too often is her own deceiver, And revels—even in a world like this— In golden visions of unbounded bliss. But he who, looking on the naked chart Of Life, feels nature sinking at his heart, He who is drugged with sorrows, he for whom Affliction carves a pathway to the tomb, He will unite with me to bless that Power Who gathers and transplants the fragile flower Ere yet the spirit of the whirlwind storm Comes forth in wrath to prostrate and deform. And if it be that God Himself removes From peril and contagion those He loves, Weep such no more—but strew with freshest roses The hallowed mound where Innocence reposes. So may bright lilies and each odorous flower Grow o'er thy grave and form a beauteous bower, Exhaust their sweetness on the gales around, And drop, for grief, their honey on the ground! The world is round me now, but sad and single I stand amid the throng with whom I mingle; Not one of all of whom can be to me The bosom treasure I have lost in thee. LIFE AND ITS ILLUSIONS. “Lean not on Earth—'twill pierce thee to the heart— A broken reed at best, but oft a spear, On whose sharp point Peace bleeds, and Hope expires.” —Young. We are but shadows! None of all those things, Formless and vague, that flit upon the wings Of wild Imagination round thy couch, When Slumber seals thine eyes, is clothed with such An unreality as Human Life, Cherished and clung to as it is; the fear, The thrilling hope, the agonising strife Are not more unavailing there than here. To him who reads what Nature would portray, What speaks the night? A comment on the day. Day dies—Night lives—and, as in dumb derision, Mocks the past phantom with her own vain vision! Man shuts the Volume of the Past for aye— A blind slave to the all-absorbing Present, He courts debasement, and from day to day His wheel of toil revolves, revolves incessant; And well may earth-directed zeal be blighted! And well may Time laugh selfish hopes to scorn! He lives in vain whose reckless years have slighted The humbling truth which Penitence and grey Hairs teach the Wise, that such cold hopes are born Only to dupe and to be thus requited! How many such there be!—in whom the thorn Which Disappointment plants festers in vain, Save as the instrument of sleepless pain— Who bear about with them the burning feeling And fire of that intolerable word Which, inly searching, pierceth, like a sword, The breast whose wounds thenceforward know no healing! Behold the overteeming globe! Its millions Bear mournful witness. Cycles, centuries roll, That Man may madly forfeit Heaven's pavilions, To hug his darling trammels:—Yet the soul, The startled soul, upbounding from the mire Of earthliness, and all alive with fears, Unsmothered by the lethargy of years Whose dates are blanks, at moments will inquire, “And whither tends this wasting struggle? Hath The living universe no loftier path Than that we toil on ever? Must the eye Of Hope but light a desert? Shall the high Spirit of Enterprise be chilled and bowed, And grovel in darkness, reft of all its proud Prerogatives? Alas! and must Man barter The Eternal for the Perishing—but to be The world's applauded and degraded martyr, Unsouled, enthralled, and never to be free?” Ancient of Days! First Cause! Adored! Unknown! Who wert, and art, and art to come! The heart Yearns, in its lucid moods, to Thee alone! Thy name is Love; thy word is Truth; thou art The Fount of Happiness—the source of Glory— Eternity is in thy hands, and Power. Oh, from that sphere unrecognised by our Slow souls, look down upon a world which, hoary In Evil and in Error though it be, Retains even yet some trace of that primeval Beauty that bloomed upon its brow ere Evil And Error wiled it from Thy Love and Thee! Look down, and if, while human brows are brightening In godless triumph, angel eyes be weeping, Publish Thy will in syllables of lightning And sentences of thunder to the Sleeping! Look down, and renovate the waning name Of Goodness, and relume the waning light Of Truth and Purity!—that all may aim At one imperishable crown—the bright Guerdon which they who by untired and holy Exertion overcome the world, inherit— The Self-denying, the Peaceable, the Lowly, The truly Merciful, the Poor in spirit! So shall the end of thine all-perfect plan At length be realised in erring Man. LIFE IS THE DESERT AND THE SOLITUDE. It is the joyous time of June, And fresh from Nature's liberal hand Is richly lavished every boon The laughing earth and skies demand; How shines the variegated land— How swell the many sparkling streams! All is as gorgeous and as grand As the creations wherewith teems The poet's haunted brain amid his noonday dreams. Falls now the golden veil of even; The vault on high, the intense profound, Breaks into all the hues of heaven; I see far off the mountains crowned With glory—I behold around Enough of summer's power to mould The breast not altogether bound By grief to thoughts whose uncontrolled Fervour leaves feeling dumb and human utterance cold. Yet I am far—oh! far from feeling The life, the thrilling glow, the power Which have their dwelling in the healing And holy influence of the hour. Affliction is my doom and dower; And cares, in many a darkening throng, Like night-clouds round a ruin, lour Over a soul which (never strong To stem the tide of ill) will not resist them long. And all that glances on my vision, Inanimate or breathing, rife With voiceless beauty, half Elysian, Of youthful and exuberant life, Serves but to nurse the sleepless strife Within—arousing the keen thought, Quick-born, which stabbeth like a knife, And wakes anticipations fraught With heaviest hues of gloom from memory's pictures wrought. What slakeless strife is still consuming This martyred heart from day to day? Lies not the bower where love was blooming Time-trampled into long decay? Alas! when hope's illusive ray Plays round our paths, the bright deceiver Allures us only to betray, Leaving us thenceforth wanderers ever, Forlorn along the shores of life's all-troubled river. Had I but dreamed in younger years That time should paralyse and bow Me thus—thus fill mine eyes with tears— Thus chill my soul and cloud my brow! No! I had not been breathing now— This heart had long ago been broken; I had not lived to witness how Deeply and bitterly each token Of bygone joy will yield what misery hath bespoken. Alas! for those who stand alone— The shrouded few who feel and know What none beside have felt and known To all of such a mould below Is born an undeparting woe, Beheld by none and shared with none— A cankering worm whose work is slow, But gnaws the heart-strings one by one, And drains the bosom's blood till the last drop be gone. ENTHUSIASM. Not yet trodden under wholly, Not yet darkened, Oh, my spirit's flickering lamp, art thou! Still, alas! thou wanest—though but slowly; And I feel as though my heart had hearkened To the whispers of despondence now. Yet the world shall not enthral me— Never! never! On my briary pathway to the grave Shapes of pain and peril may appal me, Agony and ruin may befal me— Darkness and dismay may lower ever, But, cold world, I will not die thy slave! Underneath my foot I trample You, ye juggles— Pleasure, passion, thirst of power and gold! Shall I, dare I, shame the bright example, Beaming, burning in the deeds and struggles Of the consecrated few of old? Sacred flame—which art eternal! Oh! bright essence! Thou, Enthusiasm! forsake me not! Oh, though life be reft of all her vernal Beauty, ever let thy magic presence Shed its glory round my clouded lot. TWENTY GOLDEN YEARS AGO. O, the rain, the weary, dreary rain, How it plashes on the window-sill! Night, I guess too, must be on the wane, Strass and Gass around are grown so still. Here I sit, with coffee in my cup— Ah! 'twas rarely I beheld it flow In the taverns where I loved to sup Twenty golden years ago! Twenty years ago, alas!—but stay, On my life, 'tis half-past twelve o'clock! After all, the hours do slip away— Come, here goes to burn another block! For the night, or morn, is wet and cold, And my fire is dwindling rather low:— I had fire enough, when young and bold, Twenty golden years ago! Dear! I don't feel well at all, somehow: Few in Weimar dream how bad I am; Floods of tears grow common with me now, High-Dutch floods, that Reason cannot dam. Doctors think I'll neither live nor thrive If I mope at home so—I don't know— Am I living now? I was alive Twenty golden years ago. Wifeless, friendless, flagonless, alone, Not quite bookless, though, unless I chuse, Left with nought to do, except to groan, Not a soul to woo, except the Muse— O! this, this is hard for me to bear, Me, who whilome lived so much en haut, Me, who broke all hearts like chinaware Twenty golden years ago! P'rhaps 'tis better:—Time's defacing waves Long have quenched the radiance of my brow— They who curse me nightly from their graves Scarce could love me were they living now; But my loneliness hath darker ills— Such dun-duns as Conscience, Thought and Co., Awful Gorgons! worse than tailors' bills Twenty golden years ago! Did I paint a fifth of what I feel, O, how plaintive you would ween I was! But I won't, albeit I have a deal More to wail about than Kerner has! Kerner's tears are wept for withered flowers, Mine for withered hopes; my Scroll of Woe Dates, alas! from Youth's deserted bowers, Twenty golden years ago! Yet may Deutschland's bardlings flourish long! Me, I tweak no beak among them;—hawks Must not pounce on hawks; besides, in song I could once beat all of them by chalks. Though you find me, as I near my goal, Sentimentalising like Rousseau, O! I had a grand Byronian soul Twenty golden years ago! Tick-tick, tick-tick!—Not a sound save Time's, And the windgust, as it drives the rain— Tortured torturer of reluctant rhymes, Go to bed, and rest thine aching brain! Sleep!—no more the dupe of hopes or schemes; Soon thou sleepest where the thistles blow— Curious anticlimax to thy dreams Twenty golden years ago! THE COMING EVENT. Curtain the lamp, and bury the bowl— The ban is on drinking! Reason shall reign the queen of the soul When the spirits are sinking. Chained lies the demon that smote with blight Men's morals and laurels; So, hail to Health, and a long Good-night To old wine and new quarrels! Nights shall descend, and no taverns ring To the roar of our revels; Mornings shall dawn, but none of them bring White lips and blue devils. Riot and Frenzy sleep with Remorse In the obsolete potion, And Mind grows calm as a ship on her course O'er the level of Ocean. So should it be!—for Man's world of romance Is fast disappearing, And shadows of Changes are seen in advance, Whose epochs are nearing; And days are at hand when the Best will require All means of salvation, And the souls of men shall be tried in the fire Of the Final Probation. And the Witling no longer or sneers or smiles; And the Worldling dissembles; And the blank-minded Sceptic feels anxious at whiles, And wonders and trembles; And fear and defiance are blent in the jest Of the blind Self-deceiver; And infinite hope is born in the breast Of the childlike Believer. Darken the lamp, then, and bury the bowl, Ye Faithfullest-hearted! And, as your swift years hasten on to the goal Whither worlds have departed, Spend all, sinew, soul, in your zeal to atone For the past and its errors; So best shall ye bear to encounter alone The Event and its terrors. GASPARÓ BANDOLLO. AN ANECDOTE OF THE SOUTH OF ITALY. (1820.) I. Once—twice—the stunning musquetry Peals echoing down the dark ravine. Sevrini's blood wells forth like wine. Weak—footsore—faint as faint may be, And powerless to resist or flee, He drags him to a peasant's hovel. “Ha! Giambattista!—thou, good boy? One short hour's shelter! I can grovel Unseen beneath yon scattered sheaves. So!—there! Departing Daylight leaves This nook dark; and, methinks, the spot Is safe if thou betray me not. Let me but baffle those base hounds! If mine plead not, Italia's wounds May—that Italia they destroy!” —He speaks, and crouches down, and gathers Around his limbs the light loose litter, With one deep groan—O God, how bitter!— Given to the lost land of his fathers. II. Hark! his pursuers follow after— On by the bloody track they follow. Rings their fierce yell of demon laughter Upon the winds, adown the hollow. Rings loud exulting yell on yell. —“By Heaven!—See!—here the miscreant fell And rose again!—and, if these black Leaves mock us not, here fails the track! Ha, so!—a hut! The hunted rebel Hath earthed him here. Now, comrades, treble Your care! A thousand gold zecchini Are on the head, alive or dead, Of the outlaw, Vascoló Sevrini!” III. Half loth alike to leave or linger, In burst the slaves of Alien Law.— O! ruefullest of sights to see! Mute stands yon trembler, but his finger Points to the blood-bedabbled straw, That blushes for his perfidy. Ill-starred Sevrini, woe for thee! God be thy stay, thou Doomed One, thou! Strong hands and many are on thee now; Through the long gorge of that steep valley They drag thee up Mount Bruno's brow, And thy best bravery little skills! O! stood'st thou on Calabria's hills, With nought beside thine own good sword, With nothing save the soul that slumbers Within thee now, to quell this horde!— But, bleeding—bound—o'erborne by numbers, Thy day is by to strike and rally! Thou fallest by the hands of cravens Rock-hardened against all remorse; And Morn's red rays shall see the ravens Fleshing their foul beaks in thy corse! IV. But Heaven and Earth are hushed once more. Young Giambattista's eyes are bent In fearful glances on the floor. But little weeneth he or weeteth Of the deep cry his land repeateth In million tones of one lament. Nought pondereth he of wars of yore, Of battling Ghibelline and Guelph, And bootless fights and trampled lands, And Gallic swords and Teuton chains, His eye but marks yon dark-red stains. Those red stains now burn on himself, And in his heart, and on his hands! V. But sky and sea once more are still; The duskier shades of Eventide Are gathering round Mount Bruno's hill. The boy starts up, as from a dream; He hears a low, quick sound outside. Was it the running valley-stream? No! 'twas his father's foot that trod. Alas, poor nerveless youth! denied The kindling blood that fires thy race, Dost thou not weep, and pray thy God That Earth might ope its depths, and hide Thee from that outraged father's face? VI. The eye is dark, the cheek is hollow, To-night of Gasparó Bandollo, And his high brow shows worn and pale. Slight signs all of the inward strife— Of the soul's lightning, swift to strike And sure to slay, but flashing never! For Man and Earth and Heaven alike Seem for him voiceful of a tale That robs him of all rest for ever, And leaves his own right hand to sever The last link binding him to Life! Calm even to marble, stern and sad, He eyes the spots of tell-tale hue, Then, turning to the cowering lad, With stirless lips but asks him, “Who?” VII. “Oh, father!” cried the boy—then, wild With terror of some dreadful doom, He gasped for breath.—“Speak, wretched child! Who sought my asylum, and from whom?” —“O God! Sevrini!”—“From—” “The Sbirri.” “The fugitive was wounded, weary?”— —“O, father! I—this dreary room—” —“And thou betrayedst him?”—“O Heaven!”— —“And thou betrayedst him?”—“I—only—” —“And thou betrayedst him?” “O! hear me, My father! I watch here so lonely All day, and feel, oh! so bereaven, With not a sight or sound to cheer me! My mind—my—But, I only pointed— I spake not!”—And, with such disjointed And feeble phrases, the poor youth, Powerless to gloss the ghastly truth, Sank on his knees with shrieks and tears Before the author of his years. —And he? What throes his breast might stifle Were hidden as beneath a pall. He merely turned him to the wall, And, with closed eyes, took down his rifle. VIII. “Go forth, boy!”—“Father! father!—spare”— —“Go forth, boy! So! Now kneel in prayer!” —“My God!—my father!”—“Ay, boy, right! Hast now none other!”—There is light Enough still for a deed of blood. Stern man, whose sense of nationhood So vanquishes thy love paternal, And wilt thou, then, pollute this vernal And virgin sod with gore even now, And a son's gore? What answerest thou? —“Kneel down!” Ay! he will kneel—and fall, Will kneel, and fall to rise no more; But not by thee shall thus be sped The spirit of yon trembling thrall! Didst thou dream nought of this before? Fate slayeth him. Thy child is dead. IX. The child is dead of old Bandollo, And he, the sire, hath scarce to follow His offspring to the last dark barrow, So much hath Grief's long-rankling arrow Forestalled for him that doom of Death Which takes from Suffering nought save breath— A grief that speaks, albeit untold, And lives, where all seems dead and cold, And finds no refuge in the Past, And sees the Future overcast With broader gloom than even the Present. Better that thou, unhappy peasant, Hadst died in youth and made no sign, Nor dreamt Life's Day must have an Even. Better thy child's lot had been thine— The best lot after all! for Heaven Most careth for such weakling souls.— Onwards in power the wide flood rolls Whose thunder-waves wake evermore The caverned soul of each far shore, But when the midnight storm-wind sweeps In wrath above its broken deeps, What heart but ponders darkly over The myriad wrecks those waters cover! It is the lonely brook alone That winds its way with Music's tone By orange bower and lily-blossom, And sinks into the Parent Wave, Not as worn Age into its grave, But as pure Childhood on God's bosom. AN INVITATION. Friends to Freedom! is't not time That your course were shaped at length? Wherefore stand ye loitering here? Seek some healthier, holier clime, Where your souls may grow in strength, And whence Love hath exiled Fear! Europe—Southern, Saxon, Celt— Sits alone, in tattered robe, In our days she burns with none Of the lightning-life she felt, When Rome shook the troubled globe, Twenty centuries agone. Deutschland sleeps: her star hath waned, France, the Thundress whilome, now Singeth small, with bated breath; Spain is bleeding, Poland chained; Italy can but groan and vow; England lieth sick to death. Cross with me the Atlantic's foam, And your genuine goal is won. Purely Freedom's breezes blow, Merrily Freedom's children roam By the dœdal Amazon, And the glorious Ohio! Thither take not gems and gold, Nought from Europe's robber-hoards Must profane the Western Zones. Thither take ye spirits bold, Thither take ye ploughs and swords, And your father's buried bones! Come!—if Liberty's true fires Burn within your bosoms, come! If ye would that in your graves Your free sons would bless their sires Make the Far Green West your home, Cross with me the Atlantic's waves! SIBERIA. In Siberia's wastes The Ice-wind's breath Woundeth like the toothèd steel; Lost Siberia doth reveal Only blight and death. Blight and death alone. No Summer shines. Night is interblent with Day. In Siberia's wastes alway The blood blackens, the heart pines. In Siberia's wastes No tears are shed, For they freeze within the brain. Nought is felt but dullest pain, Pain acute, yet dead; Pain as in a dream, When years go by Funeral-paced, yet fugitive, When man lives, and doth not live, Doth not live—nor die. In Siberia's wastes Are sands and rocks. Nothing blooms of green or soft, But the snow-peaks rise aloft And the gaunt ice-blocks. And the exile there Is one with those; They are part, and he is part, For the sands are in his heart, And the killing snows. Therefore, in those wastes None curse the Czar. Each man's tongue is cloven by The North Blast, that heweth nigh With sharp scymitar. And such doom each drees, Till, hunger-gnawn, And cold-slain, he at length sinks there, Yet scarce more a corpse than ere His last breath was drawn. VERY INTERESTING SONNETS. To Caroline. I. [Have I not called thee angel-like and fair?] Have I not called thee angel-like and fair? What wouldst thou more? 'Twere perilous to gaze Long on those dark bright eyes whose flashing rays Fill with a soft and fond, yet proud, despair The bosoms of the shrouded few, who share Their locked-up thoughts with none: thou hast their praise; But beauty hears not their adoring lays, Which tremble when but whispered in the air. Yet, think not, although stamped as one of those, Ah! think not thou this heart hath never burned With passion deeply felt and ill returned. If, ice-cold now, its pulse no longer glows, The memory of unuttered love and woes Lies there, alas! too faithfully inurned. II. [For once I dreamed that mutual love was more] For once I dreamed that mutual love was more Than a bright phantom thought; and when mankind Mocked mine illusion, then did I deplore Their ignorance, and deem them cold and blind. And years rolled on, and still I did adore The unreal image loftily enshrined In the recesses of mine own sick mind. Enough; the spell is broke—the dream is o'er, The enchantment is dissolved—the world appears The thing it is—a theatre—a mart. Genius illumines, and the work of art Renews the wonders of our childhood's years; Power awes—wealth shines—wit sparkles—but the heart, The heart is lost, for love no more endears. COUNSEL TO THE WORLDLY-WISE. Go A-Foot and go A-head! That's the way to prosper; Whoso must be carriage-led Suffereth serious loss per Day in health as well as wealth, By that laziness with which Walkers have from birth warred; And ere long grim Death by stealth Mounts the tilbury, and the rich Loller tumbleth earthward! Also keep your conscience pure— Neither lie nor borrow; He who starves to-day, be sure Always carves to-morrow. March in front; don't sulk behind; Dare to live, though sneering groups Dub you rara avis— “Serve your country—love your kind,” And whene'er your spirit droops, Think of Thomas Davis! COUNSEL OF A COSMOPOLITAN. Give smiles and sighs alike to all, Serve all, but love not any; Love's dangerous and delicious thrall Hath been the tomb of many. The sweetest wine-thoughts of the heart Are turned ere long to bitter; Sad memories loom when joys depart, And gloom comes after glitter. Why pawn thy soul for one lone flower, And slight the whole bright garland; Clarissa's eyes, Lucinda's bower, Will fail thee in a far land! Love God and Virtue! Love the Sun, The Stars, the Trees, the Mountains! The only living streams that run Flow from Eternal Fountains! LINES WRITTEN IN A NUNNERY CHAPEL. Me hither from noonlight A voice ever calls Where pale pillars cluster And organ tones roll— Nor sunlight nor moonlight E'er silvers these walls— Lives here other lustre— The Light of the Soul. Here budded and blossomed— Here faded and died— Like brief blooming roses Earth's purest of pure! Now ever embosomed In bliss they abide— Oh! may, when Life closes, My meed be as sure! THE NIGHT IS FALLING. The night is falling in chill December, The frost is mantling the silent stream, Dark mists are shrouding the mountain's brow; My soul is weary: I now Remember The days of roses but as a dream. The icy hand of the old Benumber, The hand of Winter is on my brain, I try to smile, while I inly grieve: I dare not hope or believe That Summer Will ever brighten the earth again. So, gazing gravewards, albeit immortal, Man cannot pierce through the girdling Night That sunders Time from Eternity, Nor feel this death-vale to be The portal To realms of glory and Living Light. WISDOM AND FOLLY. They who go forth, and finally win Their way to the Temple of Truth by Error's multiplied stages, They are the Sages! They who stop short for life at some inn On the side of the road—say Momus's, Mammon's, or Cupid's, They are the Stupids! REST ONLY IN THE GRAVE. I rode till I reached the House of Wealth— 'Twas filled with Riot and blighted health. I rode till I reached the House of Love— 'Twas vocal with sighs beneath and above! I rode till I reached the House of Sin— There were shrieks and curses without and within. I rode till I reached the House of Toil— Its inmates had nothing to bake or boil. I rode in search of the House of Content But never could reach it, far as I went! The House of Quiet, for strong and weak And Poor and rich, I have still to seek— That House is narrow, and dark, and small— But the only Peaceful House of all! LIFE. O human destiny! thou art a mystery Which tasks the o'er-wearied intellect in vain; A world thou art of cabalistic history Whose lessons madden and destroy the brain, O Life!—whose page, a necromantic scroll, Is charactered with sentences of terror Which, like the shapes on a magician's mirror, At once bewilder and appal the soul— We blindly roam thy labyrinth of error, And clasp a phantom when we gain thy goal! Yet roll, thou troubled flood of Time! Still bear Thy base wrecks to the whirlgulfs of the past— But Man and Heaven will bless thee if thou hast Spared for their final sphere the Noble and the Fair. LOVE. Spirit of wordless love! that in the lone Bowers of the poet's museful soul doth weave Tissues of thought, hued like the skies of eve Ere the last glories of the sun hath shone! How soon, almost before our hearts have known The change, above the ruins of thy throne Whose trampled beauty we would fain retrieve By all earth's thrones beside, we stand and grieve! We weep not, for the world's chill breath hath bound In triple ice the fountain of our tears, And ever-mourning memory thenceforth rears Her altars upon desecrated ground, And always, with a low despairful sound, Tolls the disastrous bell of all our years! LAMENTATION OF JEREMIAS OVER JERUSALEM. (A Paraphrase from Holy Scripture.) “And it came to pass, after Israel was carried into captivity, and Jerusalem was desolate, that Jeremias the prophet sat weeping, and mourned with this lamentation over Jerusalem, and with a sorrowful mind, sighing and moaning, he said”:— How doth she sit alone, The city late so thronged; how doth she sit in woe, Begirt with solitude and graves! Oh! how is she that from her Temple-throne Ruled o'er the Gentiles, now become A widow in her dreary home! How have her Princes fallen low, And dwindled into slaves! She weepeth all night long, Forsaken and forgot: her face is dusk with tears; Her heart is rent with many throes, Not one of all the once-admiring throng That sued and wooed her night and morn But looketh down on her with scorn! Her fondest friends of other years Have now become her foes! Her dwelling-place is dark: Her palaces lie waste: she feareth even to pass Their bass-courts desolate and bare. She hath become a byword and a mark Among the nations: lorn and lone, She seeketh rest and findeth none. Her persecuting foes, alas! Have caught her in their snare! Gloom shroudeth Sion's halls And trodden in the dust lie silver lamp and bowl, Her golden gates are turned to clay, Her priests are now the godless Gentiles' thralls. Her youths walk wan and sorrow-worn; Her silent virgins droop and mourn. In hopeless bitterness of soul She sigheth all the day! Behold the sad Bereaven! Her enemies have grown to be her pitiless lords, And mock her in her sore disgrace! Her sins have risen in black array to Heaven; Therefore the Lord Jehovah hath Rained on her head His chastening wrath; Therefore her sons go bound with cords Before the oppressor's face! How hath her glory fled! The beauty is out-blotted as a fallen star Of her that whilom looked so fair! Her stricken Princes cower for shame and dread! Like wandering sheep, that seek in vain Their pasture ground o'er hill and plain, They stray abroad, they flee afar, Guideless, and in despair! Oh! lost Jerusalem Where now be her mad hours of wantonness and wine? Her leprousness is on her hands, So lately prankt with pearl and golden gem! A captive Queen she sits, cast down From Heaven to Earth, without her crown! O Lord, my God, what grief is mine To see her thus in bands! She lieth overthrown, Smitten of Thee, O Lord! and shrinking in her fear Before the alien Gentile powers, Since Thou hast cast away Thy Church, Thine own! They violate her sanctuary, Of whom command was given by Thee, That they should ne'er adventure near Her Temple and its towers! Woe for the fallen Queen! Her people groan and die, despairful of relief. They famish and they cry for bread! No more her nobles walk in silken sheen! Their gauds and rings, their precious things Are pawned for food! O God! it wrings My soul to see it! Through my grief I lie as one half dead! Oh, ye who travel by! All ye who pass this way, stop short a while, and see If Earth have sorrow like to mine! Judea's dark iniquities belie The faith she vaunteth in her God; And therefore are her people trod In dust this day, and men tread me As treaders tread the wine. O, most mysterious Lord! From Thine high place in Heaven Thou sendest fire and flame Into my dry and withered bones! Thou searchest me as with an angry sword! Thou spreadest snares aneath my feet! In vain I pray, in vain entreat, Thou turnest me away with shame, And heedest not my groans! Thus waileth she aloud, The God-forsaken one, in this her day of dole:— “My spirit faileth me; mine eyes Are filmèd o'er with mist; my neck is bowed Beneath a yoke the livelong day, And there doth lie a weight alway, An iron hand, on my spent soul, That will not let it rise! “The Lord, the Lord is just! His wrath is kindled fierce against me for my ways. I have provoked the Lord, my God, Therefore I make my darkling bed in dust. Pity me, ye who see me, all! Pity my sons, who pine in thrall! Their spirit wastes, their strength decays, Under the Gentile's rod. “I sought my friends to tell The story of my woes; alas! they would not hear! Disease drank up my princes' blood, For Famine's hand lay black on them as well. My priests, too, fainted on their feet; They feebly crawled from street to street, Seeking all day, afar and near, A morsel of coarse food! “Behold, O Lord!—behold! Behold my wretchedness! For I am overcome By suffering—almost by despair! My heart is torn with agonies untold! The land expires beneath Thy frown; Abroad the red sword striketh down Its tens of thousands; and at home Death reigneth everywhere! “My groanings are not hid. All they who hated me regard me with disdain! They see the darkness of my face, And mock it, for they know Thou hast forbid My nearest friends to help me now. But Thou wilt yet avenge me, Thou! They shall lie low where I have lain Who scoff at my disgrace! “Then shall their evil fall On their own heads—for still 'tis evil in Thy sight, And they shall mourn as now I mourn; And Thou, Lord, shalt make vintage of them all, And tread them down even as they see Thou, for my sins, hast trodden me, They who to-day deride and slight The afflictions I have borne!” KHIDDER. Thus said or sung Khidder, the ever-young:— Journeying, I passed an ancient town— Of lindens green its battlements bore a crown, And at its turreted gates, on either hand, Did fountains stand, In marble white of rarest chiselling, The which on high did fling Water, that then like rain went twinkling down, With a rainbow glancing in the spray As it wreathed in the sunny ray. I marked where, 'neath the frown Of the dark rampart, smiled a garden fair; And an old man was there, That gathered fruit. “Good father,” I began, “Since when, I pray you, standeth here This goodly city with its fountains clear?” To which that agèd man Made answer—“Ever stood The city where it stands to-day, And as it stands so shall it stand for aye, Come evil days or good.” Him gathering fruit I left, and journeyed on; But when a thousand years were come and gone, Again I passed that way, and lo! There was no city, there were no Fountains of chiselling rare, No garden fair, Only A lonely Shepherd was piping there, Whose little flock seemed less In that wide pasture of the wilderness. “Good friend,” quoth I, “How long hath the fair city passed away, That stood with gates so high, With fountains bright, and gardens gay, Where now these sheep do stray?” And he replied—“What withers makes but room For what springs up in verdurous bloom— Sheep have grazed ever here, and here will graze for aye.” Him piping there I left, and journeyed on; But when a thousand years were come and gone, Again I passed That way, and see! there was a lake That darkened in the blast, And waves that brake With a melancholy roar Along that lonely shore. And on a shingly point that ran Far out into the lake, a fisherman Was hauling in his net. To him I said: “Good friend, I fain would know Since when it is that here these waters flow?” Whereat he shook his head, —And answer made, “Heaven lend Thee better wit, good brother! Ever here These waters flowed, and so Will ever flow: And aye in this dark rolling wave Men fished, and still fish, And ever will fish, Until fish No more in waters swim.” Him Hauling his net I left, and journeyed on; But when a thousand years were come and gone, Again I passed that way, and lo! there stood, Where waves had rolled, a green and flourishing wood— Flourishing in youth it seemed, and yet was old— And there it stood where deep blue waves had rolled. A place of pleasant shade! A wandering wind among the branches played, And birds were now where fish had been; And through the depth of green, In many a gush the golden sunshine streamed; And wild flowers gleamed About the brown and mossy Roots of the ancient trees, And the cushioned sward so glossy That compassed these. Here, as I passed, there met Me, on the border of that forest wide, One with an axe, whom, when I spied, Quoth I—“Good neighbour, let Me ask, I pray you, how long hath this wood Stood, Spreading its covert, broad and green, Here, where mine eyes have seen A royal city stand, whose battlements Were like the ancient rocks; And then a place for shepherds' tents, And pasturage of flocks; And then, Roughening beneath the blast, A vast Dark mere—a haunt of fishermen?” There was a cold surprise In the man's eyes While thus I spoke, and, as I made an end, This was his dry Reply— “Facetious friend, This wood Hath ever stood Even where it stands to-day; And as it stands, so shall it stand for aye. And here men catch no fish—here tend No sheep—to no town-markets wend; But aye in these Green shades men felled, and still fell, And ever will fell Trees.” Him with his axe I left, and journeyed on; But when a thousand years were come and gone, Again I passed That way; and lo! a town— And spires, and domes, and towers looked proudly down Upon a vast And sounding tide of life, That flowed through many a street, and surged In many a market-place, and urged Its way in many a wheeling current, hither And thither. How rose the strife Of sounds! the ceaseless beat Of feet! The noise of carts, of whips—the roll Of chariots, coaches, cabs, gigs—(all Who keep the last-named vehicle we call Respectable)—horse-tramplings, and the toll Of bells; the whirl, the clash, the hubbub-mingling Of voices, deep and shrill; the clattering, jingling, The indescribable, indefinable roar; The grating, creaking, booming, clanking, thumping, And bumping, And stumping Of folks with wooden legs; the gabbling, And babbling, And many more Quite nameless helpings To the general effect; dog-yelpings, Laughter, and shout, and cry; all sounds of gladness, Of sadness, And madness,— For there were people marrying, And others carrying The dead they would have died for to the grave— (Sadly the church bell tolled When the young men were burying the old— More sadly spake that bodeful tongue When the old were burying the young)— Thus did the tumult rave Through that fair city—nor were wanting there Of dancing dogs or bear, Or needy knife- Grinder, or man with dismal wife, That sang deplorably of “purling groves And verdant streams, all where young Damon roves With tender Phillida, the nymph he loves, And softly breathe The balmy moonbeam's wreathe, And amorous turtle-doves”— Or other doleful men, that blew The melancholiest tunes—the which they only knew— On flutes and other instruments of wind; Or small dark imps, with hurdy- Gurdy, And marmoset, that grinned For nuts, and might have been his brother, They were so like each other; Or man That danced like the god Pan, Twitching A spasmy face From side to side with a grace Bewitching, The while he whistled In sorted pipes, all at his chin that bristled; Or fiddler, fiddling much For little profit, and a many such Street musics most forlorn In that too pitiless rout quite overborne. Now, when as I beheld The crowd, and heard the din of life once more Swell, as it swelled In that same place four thousand years before, I asked of them that passed me in the throng How long The city thereabouts had stood, And what was gone with pasture, lake, and wood; But at such question most men did but stare, And so pass on; and some did laugh and shake Their heads, me deeming mad; but none would spare The time, or take The pains to answer me, for there All were in haste—all busy—bent to make The most of every minute, And do, an if they might, an hour's work in it. Yet as I gave not o'er, but pertinaciously Plied with my question every passer-by, A dozen voices did at length reply Ungraciously— “What ravest thou Of pasture, lake, and wood? As it is now So was it always here, and so will be for aye.” Them, hurrying there, I left, and journeyed on— But when a thousand years are come and gone, Again I'll pass that way. BEAR UP. Time rolleth on; and with our years Our sorrows grow and multiply, Our visions fade; With late remorse and withering fears, We look for light to days gone by; But all is shade. Our dear fond friends have long been gone, No moon is up in Heaven above; The chill winds blow. The dolorous night of age comes on; The current of our life and love Moves low, moves slow. Yet earth hath still a twofold dower; On desert sands the palm trees rise In greenest bloom; The dawn breaks at the darkest hour; Stars brightliest shine when midnight skies Are palled in gloom; The deep hath treasures unrevealed Of gold and gems and argosies, And gallant ships; The sword strikes hurtless on the shield; And from the once plague-laden breeze Health greets thy lips! Thou, therefore, man, shalt never droop, Shalt never doubt, shalt always trust The power of God; Thou art not Heaven's or nature's dupe! This fleshly hull shall rot in dust, A trodden clod. But wilt thou cower, tho' death draw nigh? The mouldering frame, the eternal soul, Which, say, is best; Thou canst not live unless thou die, Thou must march far to reach thy goal Of endless rest. Bear up! even tho' thou be, like me, Stretched on a couch of torturing pain This weary day; Tho' heaven and earth seem dark to thee, And thine eye glance around in vain For one hope-ray! Tho' overborne by wrong and ill, Tho' thou hast drained, even to the lees, Life's bitter cup. Tho' death and hell be round thee still. Place faith in God! He hears, He sees! Bear up! Bear up! SONNET. [Bird that discoursest from yon poplar bough] Bird that discoursest from yon poplar bough, Outweeping night, and in thy eloquent tears Holding sweet converse with the thousand spheres That glow and glisten from Night's glorious brow— Oh! may thy lot be mine! that, lonely now, And doomed to mourn the remnant of my years, My song may swell to more than mortal ears, And sweet as is thy strain be poured my vow! Bird of the poet's paradise! by thee Taught where the tides of feeling deepest tremble, Playful in gloom, like some sequestered sea, I, too, amidst my anguish would dissemble, And turn misfortune to such melody That my despair thy transports would resemble! GENIUS. (WRITTEN AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN.) O Genius! Genius! all thou dost endure, First from thyself, and finally from those The earth-bound and the blind, who cannot feel That there be souls with purposes as pure And lofty as the mountain snows, and zeal All quenchless as the spirit whence it flows. In whom that fire, struck like the spark from steel, In other bosoms ever lives and glows. Of such, thrice blessed are they whom ere mature Life generates woes which God alone can heal, His mercy calls to loftier spheres than this— For the mind's conflicts are the worst of woes; And fathomless and fearful yawns the Abyss Of Darkness thenceforth under all who inherit The melancholy changeless hue of heart Which flings its pale gloom o'er the years of youth, Those most—or least—illumined by the spirit Of the eternal archetype of Truth. For such as these there is no peace within, Either in action or in contemplation, From first to last—but even as they begin, They close the dim night of their tribulation; Worn by the torture of the untiring breast, Which, scorning all, and shunned of all, by turns, Upheld in solitary strength begot By its own unsharèd shroudedness of lot, Through years and years of crushed hopes, throbs, and burns, And burns, and throbs, and will not be at rest, Searching a desolate Earth for that it findeth not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART IV ORIENTAL VERSIONS AND PERVERSIONS THE TIME OF THE BARMECIDES. (From the Arabic.) My eyes are filmed, my beard is grey, I am bowed with the weight of years; I would I were stretched in my bed of clay, With my long lost youth's compeers; For back to the Past, though the thought brings woe, My memory ever glides— To the old, old time, long, long ago, The time of the Barmecides. To the old, old time, long, long ago, The time of the Barmecides. Then Youth was mine, and a fierce wild will, And an iron arm in war, And a fleet foot high upon Ishkar's hill, When the watch-lights glimmered afar, And a barb as fiery as any I know, That Khoord or Beddaween rides, Ere my friends lay low—long, long ago, In the time of the Barmecides; Ere my friends lay low—long, long ago, In the time of the Barmecides. One golden goblet illumed my board, One silver dish was there; At hand my tried Karamanian sword, Lay always bright and bare; For those were the days when the angry blow Supplanted the word that chides— When hearts could glow—long, long ago, In the time of the Barmecides; When hearts could glow—long, long ago, In the time of the Barmecides. Through city and desert my mates and I Were free to rove and roam, Our diapered canopy the deep of the sky, Or the roof of the palace dome— O! ours was that vivid life to and fro Which only sloth derides— Men spent Life so, long, long ago, In the time of the Barmecides, Men spent Life so, long, long ago, In the time of the Barmecides. I see rich Bagdad once again, With its turrets of Moorish mould, And the Khalif's twice five hundred men, Whose binishes flamed with gold; I call up many a gorgeous show— Which the Pall of Oblivion hides— All passed like snow, long, long ago, With the time of the Barmecides; All passed like snow, long, long ago, With the time of the Barmecides! But mine eye is dim, and my beard is grey, And I bend with the weight of years— May I soon go down to the House of Clay Where slumber my Youth's compeers! For with them and the Past, though the thought wakes woe, My memory ever abides; And I mourn for the Times gone long ago, For the Times of the Barmecides! I mourn for the Times gone long ago, For the Times of the Barmecides! THE KARAMANIAN EXILE. (From the Turkish.) I see thee ever in my dreams, Karaman! Thy hundred hills, thy thousand streams, Karaman! O Karaman! As when thy gold-bright morning gleams, As when the deepening sunset seams With lines of light thy hills and streams, Karaman! So thou loomest on my dreams, Karaman! O Karaman! The hot bright plains, the sun, the skies, Karaman! Seem death-black marble to mine eyes, Karaman! O Karaman! I turn from summer's blooms and dyes; Yet in my dreams thou dost arise In welcome glory to my eyes, Karaman! In thee my life of life yet lies, Karaman! Thou still art holy in mine eyes, Karaman! O Karaman! Ere my fighting years were come, Karaman! Troops were few in Erzerome, Karaman! O Karaman! Their fiercest came from Erzerome, They came from Ukhbar's palace dome, They dragged me forth from thee, my home, Karaman! Thee, my own, my mountain home, Karaman! In life and death, my spirit's home, Karaman! O Karaman! O, none of all my sisters ten, Karaman! Loved like me my fellowmen, Karaman! O Karaman! I was mild as milk till then, I was soft as silk till then; Now my breast is as a den, Karaman! Foul with blood and bones of men, Karaman! With blood and bones of slaughtered men, Karaman! O Karaman! My boyhood's feelings newly born, Karaman! Withered like young flowers uptorn, Karaman! O Karaman! And in their stead sprang weed and thorn; What once I loved now moves my scorn; My burning eyes are dried to horn, Karaman! I hate the blessed light of morn, Karaman! It maddens me, the face of morn, Karaman! O Karaman! The Spahi wears a tyrant's chains, Karaman! But bondage worse than this remains, Karaman! O Karaman! His heart is black with million stains; Thereon, as on Kaf's blasted plains, Shall never more fall dews and rains Karaman! Save poison-dews and bloody rains, Karaman! O Karaman! Hell's poison dews and bloody rains, Karaman! O Karaman! But life at worst must end ere long, Karaman! Azreel avengeth every wrong, Karaman! O Karaman! Of late my thoughts rove more among Thy fields; o'ershadowing fancies throng My mind, and texts of bodeful song, Karaman! Azreel is terrible and strong, Karaman! His lightning sword smites all ere long, Karaman! O Karaman! There's care to-night in Ukhbar's halls, Karaman! There's hope too, for his trodden thralls, Karaman! O Karaman! What lights flash red along yon walls? Hark! hark!—the muster-trumpet calls!— I see the sheen of spears and shawls, Karaman! The foe! the foe!—they scale the walls, Karaman! To-night Muràd or Ukhbar falls, Karaman! O Karaman! THE TIME OF THE ROSES. (From the Turkish of Meseehi.) Ob. 1512. Morning is blushing; the gay nightingales Warble their exquisite songs in the vales; Spring, like a spirit, floats everywhere, Shaking sweet spice-showers loose from her hair, Murmurs half-musical sounds from the stream, Breathes in the valley and shines in the beam. In, in at the portals that Youth uncloses, It hastes, it wastes, the Time of the Roses! Meadows, and gardens, and sun-lighted glades, Palaces, terraces, grottoes, and shades Woo thee; a fairy-bird sings in thine ear, Come and be happy!—an Eden is here! Knowest thou whether for thee there be any Years in the Future? Ah! think on how many A young heart under the mould reposes, Nor feels how wheels the Time of the Roses! In the red light of the many-leaved rose, Mahomet's wonderful mantle re-glows, Gaudier far, but as blooming and tender, Tulips and martagons revel in splendour. Drink from the Chalice of Joy, ye who may! Youth is a flower of early decay, And Pleasure a monarch that Age deposes, When past, at last, the Time of the Roses! See the young lilies, their scymitar-petals Glancing like silver 'mid earthier metals: Dews of the brightest in life-giving showers Fall all the night on these luminous flowers, Each of them sparkles afar like a gem; Wouldst thou be smiling and happy like them? O, follow all counsel that Pleasure proposes; It dies, it flies, the Time of the Roses! Pity the roses! Each rose is a maiden, Prankt, and with jewels of dew overladen: Pity the maidens! The moon of their bloom Rises, to set in the cells of the tomb. Life has its Winter:—When Summer is gone, Maidens, like roses, lie stricken and wan; Though bright as the Burning Bush of Moses, Soon fades, fair maids, the Time of your Roses! Lustre and odours and blossoms and flowers, All that is richest in gardens and bowers, Teach us morality, speak of Mortality, Whisper that Life is a swift Unreality! Death is the end of that lustre, those odours; Brilliance and Beauty are gloomy foreboders To him who knows what this world of woes is, And sees how flees the Time of the Roses! Heed them not, hear them not! Morning is blushing, Perfumes are wandering, fountains are gushing; What though the rose, like a virgin forbidden, Long under leafy pavilion lay hidden; Now far around as the vision can stretch, Wreaths for the pencils of angels to sketch, Festoon the tall hills the landscape discloses. O! sweet, though fleet, is the Time of the Roses! Now the air—drunk from the breath of the flowers— Faints like a bride whom her bliss overpowers; Such and so rich is the fragrance that fills Æther and cloud that its essence distils, As through thin lily-leaves, earthward again, Sprinkling with rose-water garden and plain, O! joyously after the Winter closes, Returns and burns the Time of the Roses! O! for some magical vase to imprison All the sweet incense that yet has not risen! And the swift pearls that, radiant and rare, Glisten and drop through the hollows of Air! Vain! they depart, both the Beaming and Fragrant! So, too, Hope leaves us, and Love proves a vagrant, Too soon their entrancing illusion closes, It cheats, it fleets, the Time of the Roses! Tempest and Thunder, and War were abroad; Riot and Turbulence triumphed unawed; Soliman rose, and the thunders were hushed, Faction was prostrate, and Turbulence crushed; Once again Peace in her gloriousness rallies; Once again shine the glad skies on our valleys; And sweetly anew the poet composes His lays in praise of the Time of the Roses! I, too, MESEEHI, already renowned, Centuries hence by my songs shall be crowned; Far as the stars of the wide Heaven shine, Men shall rejoice in this carol of mine. Leila! Thou art as a rose unto me: Think on the nightingale singing for thee; For he who on love like thine reposes, Least heeds how speeds the Time of the Roses! THE TIME ERE THE ROSES WERE BLOWING. (From the Persian of Kazem Zerbayeh, in reply to Meseehi's “Time of the Roses.”) I Brilliantly sparkle, Meseehi, thy flowing Numbers, like streams amid lilies upgrowing, Yet, wouldst thou mingle the sad and sublime, Sing, too, the Time, Sing the young Time ere the Roses were blowing! II Then was the Season when Hope was yet glowing, Then the blithe year of the Spring and the Sowing; Then the Soul dwelt in her own fairy clime; Then was the Time, Then the gay Time ere the Roses were blowing! III Soon, ah! too soon, came the Summer, bestowing Glory and Light, but a Light ever showing In the chill nearness the Autumn's grey rime. Gone was the Time, Gone the fresh Time ere the Roses were blowing! IV Life is at best but a Coming and Going, Now flitting past us on swift, now on slow wing; Here fair with Goodness, there gloomy with Crime. O, for the Time, O, for the Time ere the Roses were blowing! V Coldly, O coldly, goes Truth overthrowing Fancy's bright palaces, coldly goes mowing Down the sweet blossoms of Boyhood's young prime. Give us the Time, Give us the Time ere the Roses were blowing! VI I am Zerba'yeh, the Least of the Knowing; Thou art Meseehi, the Golden and Glowing! O, when again thou wouldst dazzle in rhyme Sing of the Time, Sing of the Time ere the Roses were blowing! NIGHT IS NEARING. (From the Persian.) Allah Akbar! All things vanish after brief careering; Down one gulf Life's myriad barks are steering; Headlong mortal! hast thou ears for hearing? Pause! Be wise! The Night, thy Night, is nearing! Night is nearing! Allah Akbar! Towards the Darkness whence no ray is peering, Towards the Void from which no voice comes cheering, Move the countless Doomed—none volunteering— While the Winds rise and the Night is nearing! Night is nearing! Allah Akbar! See the palace-dome its pride uprearing One fleet hour, then darkly disappearing! So must all of Lofty or Endearing Fade, fail, fall;—to all the Night is nearing! Night is nearing! Allah Akbar! Then, since nought abides, but all is veering, Flee a world which Sin is hourly searing, Only so mayest front thy fate unfearing When Life wanes, and Death, like Night, is nearing! Night is nearing! THE HOWLING SONG OF AL-MOHARA. (From the Arabic.) My heart is as a House of Groans From dusky eve to dawning grey; Allah, Allah hu! The glazed flesh on my staring bones Grows black and blacker with decay; Allah, Allah hu! Yet am I none whom Death may slay; I am spared to suffer and to warn; Allah, Allah hu! My lashless eyes are parched to horn With weeping for my sin alway; Allah, Allah hu! For blood, hot blood that no man sees, The blood of one I slew Burns on my hands I cry therefóre, All night long, on my knees, Evermore, Allah, Allah hu! Because I slew him over wine, Because I struck him down at night, Allah, Allah hu! Because he died and made no sign, His blood is always in my sight; Allah, Allah hu! Because I raised my arm to smite While the foul cup was at his lips, Allah, Allah hu! Because I wrought his soul's eclipse He comes between me and the Light; Allah, Allah hu! His is the form my terror sees, The sinner that I slew; My rending cry is still therefóre, All night long, on my knees, Evermore, Allah, Allah hu! Under the all-just Heaven's expanse There is for me no resting-spot; Allah, Allah hu! I dread Man's vengeful countenance, The smiles of Woman win me not; Allah, Allah hu! I wander among graves where rot The carcases of leprous men; Allah, Allah hu! I house me in the dragon's den Till evening darkens grove and grot; Allah, Allah hu! But bootless all!—Who penance drees Must dree it his life through; My heartwrung cry is still therefóre, All night long, on my knees, Evermore, Allah, Allah hu! The silks that swathe my hall deew?n Are damascened with moons of gold; Allah, Allah hu! Musk-roses from my Gulist?n Fill vases of Egyptian mould; Allah, Allah hu! The Koran's treasures lie unrolled Near where my radiant night-lamp burns; Allah, Allah hu! Around me rows of silver urns Perfume the air with odours old; Allah, Allah hu! But what avail these luxuries? The blood of him I slew Burns red on all—I cry therefóre, All night long, on my knees, Evermore, Allah, Allah hu! Can Sultans, can the Guilty Rich Purchase with mines and thrones a draught, Allah, Allah hu! From that Nutulian fount of which The Conscience-tortured whilome quaffed? Allah, Allah hu! Vain dream! Power, Glory, Riches, Craft, Prove magnets for the Sword of Wrath; Allah, Allah hu! Thornplant Man's last and lampless path, And barb the Slaying Angel's shaft; Allah, Allah hu! O! the Bloodguilty ever sees But sights that make him rue, As I do now, and cry therefóre, All night long, on my knees, Evermore, Allah, Allah hu! THE WAIL AND WARNING OF THE THREE KHALENDEERS. (From the Ottoman.) La' laha, il Allah! Here we meet, we three, at length, Amrah, Osman, Perizad, Shorn of all our grace and strength, Poor, and old, and very sad! We have lived, but live no more; Life has lost its gloss for us, Since the days we spent of yore Boating down the Bosphorus! La' laha, il Allah! The Bosphorus, the Bosphorus! Old Time brought home no loss for us; We felt full of health and heart, Upon the foamy Bosphorus. La' laha, il Allah! Days indeed! A shepherd's tent Served us then for house and fold; All to whom we gave or lent Paid us back a thousand-fold; Troublous years, by myriads wailed, Rarely had a cross for us, Never when we gaily sailed, Singing down the Bosphorus! La' laha, il Allah! The Bosphorus, the Bosphorus! There never came a cross for us, While we daily, gaily sailed, Adown the meadowy Bosphorus. La' laha, il Allah! Blithe as birds we flew along, Laughed and quaffed and stared about; Wine and roses, mirth and song Were what most we cared about. Fame we left for quacks to seek, Gold was dust and dross for us, While we lived from week to week, Boating down the Bosphorus! La' laha, il Allah! The Bosphorus, the Bosphorus! And gold was dust and dross for us, While we lived from week to week, Aboating down the Bosphorus! La' laha, il Allah! Friends we were, and would have shared Purses, had we twenty full, If we spent, or if we spared, Still our funds were plentiful; Save the hours we passed apart Time brought home no loss for us; We felt full of hope and heart While we clove the Bosphorus! La' laha, il Allah! The Bosphorus, the Bosphorus! For life has lost its gloss for us, Since the days we spent of yore, Upon the pleasant Bosphorus! La' laha, il Allah! Ah! for youth's delirious hours Man pays well in after days, When quenched hopes and palsied powers Mock his love-and-laughter days; Thorns and thistles on our path Took the place of moss for us, Till false fortune's tempest wrath Drove us from the Bosphorus! La' laha, il Allah! The Bosphorus, the Bosphorus! When thorns took place of moss for us, Gone was all! Our hearts were graves Deep, deeper than the Bosphorus! La' laha, il Allah! Gone is all! In one abyss Lie Health, Youth, and Merriment! All we've learned amounts to this— Life's a sad experiment; What it is we trebly feel Pondering what it was for us, When our shallop's bounding keel Clove the joyous Bosphorus! La' laha, il Allah! The Bosphorus, the Bosphorus! We wail for what life was for us, When our shallop's bounding keel Clove the joyous Bosphorus! THE WARNING. La' laha, il Allah! Pleasure tempts, yet man has none Save himself t' accuse, if her Temptings prove, when all is done, Lures hung out by Lucifer. Guard your fire in youth, O Friends! Manhood's is but Phosphorus, And bad luck attends and ends Boatings down the Bosphorus! La' laha, il Allah! The Bosphorus, the Bosphorus! Youth's fire soon wanes to Phosphorus, And slight luck or grace attends Your boaters down the Bosphorus! THE WORST LOSS. (From the Persian of Djameelah.) I “Merchant! I have lost the bright and beauteous Jewelled shawl thou soldest me so lately.” —“Art, my lord, is in these days a duteous And withal a most industrious handmaid. One so rich as thou may have a greatly Finer shawl, believe me, at command made.” —“Thanks, good Merchant! Make me, then, I pray thee, A much finer shawl, and I will pay thee!” II “Architect! my handsome country villa Yesterday took fire, and nought could save it. It now lies a ruin!”—“Allah-el-illah! Fire, like Air, will find or force expansion— Fire must burn, and woodwork may not brave it! But—I'll build thee a far handsomer mansion.” —“Thanks, good Architect! The cost may make me Poorer, but, Inshallah! 'twill not break me.” III “Boatman! I have dropped a golden casket Of rich pearls (my whole wealth) in this river. I shall die!”—“Not so! Take up a basket, And hawk figs! The river hath bereft thee But of rubbish. Thank the Bounteous Giver Of all Good that Health and Hope are left thee, And be calm!”—“Well, Boatman, thou advisest! Action, Action, is in all states wisest!” IV “Hakim! All thy skill proves unavailing— Lo! he dies! My charming boy hath perished!” —“Be consoled, my friend, and cease thy wailing— This dear youth departs to another Father. Four sons, too, are left thee yet, as cherished, And more charming still. O! learn to gather Flowers amid thorns, and Comfort from bereavements— Peace and Patience are Life's true achievements!” V “Moolah! Moolah! I feel broken-hearted.” —“And why so, son? Whence this bitter anguish?” —“All is gone! My last stay hath departed, I have lost my Name!”—“Oh, wretched mortal! Lost thy name! Then, henceforth must thou languish In lone woe, shut out from Hope's last portal! Go, and consecrate thy soul to God by Sorrow, For on thy Life's Night shall never dawn a Morrow!” ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF SULTAN SULEÍMAUN THE MAGNIFICENT. (From the Turkish of Lameeyah.) I Like to a stately tree, down-smitten in its pride and prime, Wulla-hu! Like to a tower o'erthrown, a tower that stood from elder time, Wulla-hu! Lies he, the Light of Ages, The world-illuming Star, The King of Earth, the Sage of Sages, The Wise, the Brave, the True, Who harnessed victory to his car, Wull-wullahu, Wull-wullahu! II So fares the queenly ship over the ocean-wave at noon, Wulla-hu! Her poop of gold, her sails of silver, like to sun and moon, Wulla-hu! Bright shines the skies:—from them Pest Nor Storm can come:—so thinks The looker-on, when, lo! a tempest!— Loud shrieks burst from the crew, And down, down, the lost vessel sinks! Wull-wullahu! Wull-wullahu! III So, in his pomp and power, the Pasha leaves his palace-hall. Wulla-hu! Follows his cavalcade; ride forth his troops and Djanzrees all— Wulla-hu! His glory—to o'er-dusk it All human power were vain!— So dream we again—but, hark! that musquet! Its fire was all—too true The god lies lifeless on the plain. Wull-wullahu! Wull-wullahu! IV The nightingale is mute; the tulip wastes away for grief; Wulla-hu! The violet and rose, they both are yellow in the leaf; Wulla-hu! The Summer droops in sorrow; Her flowers and fruits lie dead; Her very self is fain to borrow From Autumn a faint hue For sky and earth of blue and red— Wull-wullahu! Wull-wullahu! V We who remain behind, we wither all from day to day, Wulla-hu! The sight hath left our eyes; our very beards show crisped and grey: Wulla-hu! For Plague, and Thirst, and Famine Have come down on the land: Each of us, black-skinned as a Brahmin, Sits weeping; scarce a few Take even the Koran now in hand— Wull-wullahu! Wull-wullahu! VI To God we all belong; to His decree we all must bow. Wulla-hu! Nushrévan and Djemsheed, the Kings of Earth, where are they now? Wulla-hu! Prayer Allah ever heareth, While Prayer may yet be heard, But when the dreary death-hour neareth, In vain men sigh and sue. Forth goes the irrevocable Word— Wull-wullahu! Wull-wullahu! VII Woe to us for the Lost! the Thunderer of a thousand years— Wulla-hu! The Great Soul of the Time—whose voice in Death all Earth still hears— Wulla-hu! Heaven's lightning was less mortal Than his fierce eye in wrath— Yet oped he Mercy's palace-portal Where Mercy's alms were due. God's lamp illumed his path! Wull-wullahu! Wull-wullahu! VIII He, in his manhood's day, whom now we mourn in darkling weeds, Wulla-hu! Fought against Gog and Magog, and against their hell-born creeds; Wulla-hu! He upheld the Eagle and Arrow With superhuman arm. This mean world seemed a sphere too narrow For him: his grand soul grew Perpetually more warm— Wull-wullahu! Wull-wullahu! IX O, God! God! in thy love, give thou to us the Judgment Morn! Wulla-hu! That we once more may see the Monarch who hath left us lorn— Wulla-hu! God! let the Archangel's clarion Resound throughout the Dwawn, Yet not to arraign Earth's carcase-carrion, But that we all anew May see him, even on that dread Dawn— Wull-wullahu! Wull-wullahu! THE SOFFEES' DITTY. I. Bismillah! Thou art warned, O Soffee! that mere outward austerities, however excellent in themselves, will not make thee perfect. Haircloth and vigils and fasts, and a vow against coffee, Cleansers from sin though they be, will make no one a Soffee. Much is essential besides the bare absence of sleekness, Namely: Docility, Poverty, Courage, and Meekness, Wisdom, and Silence, and Patience, and Prayer without ceasing:— Such are the tone and the tune of the ditty that we sing. II. Bismillah! Beware lest thou live in the habitual commission of any single sin; for, though the sin itself may be slight, the constant repetition of it renders it most grievous. Woe unto those who but banish one vice for another! Far from thy thoughts be such damning delusion, O brother Pluck thy heart out, and abjure all it loves and possesses Rather than cherish one sin in its guilty recesses. Donning new raiment is nobler than patching and piecing:— Such are the tone and the tune of the ditty that we sing. III. Bismillah! And, O Soffee! whensoever the glitter of money meets thine eye, avert thy face! It were better for thee to lodge a serpent in thy bosom than a money-purse. Money (saith Seyd Ul-ud-Deen) eats the soul as a cancer, Whoso loves money has more than the guilt of Ben-Manser. Wouldst thou, O Soffee! keep clear of the snare that entangles Those whom at night on their couches the Evil One strangles, Ask not and task not, abstain from extortion and fleecing— Such are the tone and the tune of the ditty that we sing. IV. Bismillah! There is no strength or wisdom but in God, the High, the Great! Thou, O Soffee, art but a creature of clay; therefore, indulge not in pride! Cast away Pride as the bane of thy soul: the Disdainful Swallow much mire in their day, and find everything painful. Still in its cave shall the diamond beam on, because humble. When the proud pillar, that stands as a giant, must crumble. Stoop! and thy burden will keep, like the camel's, decreasing. Such are the tone and the tune of the ditty that we sing. V. Bismillah! The devil, O Soffee! will doubtless try to make thee very miserable. But be thou consoled; for the seven hells are closed hereafter against those who descend into them here. Art thou made wretched by memories, and fears, and chimeras? Grieve not! for so were the Soffees and saints of past eras. All must abandon Life's lodgings, but none who depart take Any invalider passport to Hell than the heart-ache. Satan enslaveth, and Pain is God's mode of releasing— Such are the tone and the tune of the ditty that we sing. VI. Bismillah! It is good for thee to be much afflicted. As Suleymán-Ben-Daood hath said: The heart is made better by the sadness of the countenance. Like the lone lamp that illumines a Sheikh's mausoleum, Like a rich calcedon shrined in some gloomy museum, Like the bright moon before Midnight is blended with Morrow, Shines the pure pearl of the soul in the Chalice of Sorrow! Mourners on earth shall be solaced with pleasures unceasing— Such are the tone and the tune of the ditty that we sing. VII. Bismillah! As Man soweth so doth he reap; his thoughts and deeds come back to him in another world; and as these are good or ill so is he for ever happy or miserable. Ponder this well; and let each fleeting hour impress thee deeplier with the awful truth, that Time is the purchase-money of Eternity. Life is an outlay for infinite blessings or curses— Evil or Good—which Eternity's Bank reimburses. Thou, then, O Soffee, look well to each moment expended! So shall thy hands overflow, and thy guerdon be splendid, When thy brow faces the wall, and thy pangs are increasing— These be the tone and the tune of the ditty that we sing. THE LAST WORDS OF AL-HASSAN. Farewell forever to all I love! To river and rock farewell! To Zoumlah's gloomful cypress-grove, And Shaarmal's tulipy dell! To Deenween-Kûllaha's light blue bay, And Oreb's lonely strand! My race is run—I am called away— I go to the Lampless Land. 'Llah Hu! I am called away from the light of day To my tent in the Dark, Dark Land! I have seen the standard of Ali stained With the blood of the Brave and Free, And the Kaaba's Venerable Stone profaned By the truculent Wahabee. O Allah, for the light of another sun, With my Bazra sword in hand!— But I rave in vain—my course is run— I go to the Lampless Land. 'Llah Hu! My course is run—my goal is won— I go to the Dark, Dark Land! Yet why should I live a day—an hour? The friends I valued lie low; My sisters dance in the halls of the Giaour; My brethren fight for the foe. None stood by the banner this arm unfurled Save Khárada's mountain-band. 'Tis well that I leave so base a world, Though to dwell in the Lampless Land— 'Llah Hu! 'Tis well that I leave so false a world, Though to dwell in the Dark, Dark Land! Even she, my loved and lost Ameen, The moon-white pearl of my soul, Could pawn her peace for the show and sheen Of silken Istamból! How little did I bode what a year would see, When we parted at Samarkhànd— My bride in the harem of the Osmânlee, Myself in the Lampless Land! 'Llah Hu! My bride in the harem of the Osmânlee, Myself in the Dark, Dark Land! We weep for the Noble who perish young, Like flowers before their bloom— The great-souled Few who, unseen and unsung, Go down to the charnel's gloom; But, written on the brow of each, if Man Could read it and understand, Is the changeless decree of Heaven's Deewàn— We are born for the Lampless land! 'Llah Hu! By the dread firmàn of Heaven's Deewàn— All are born for the Dark, Dark Land! The wasted moon has a marvellous look Amiddle of the starry hordes— The heavens, too, shine like a mystic book, All bright with burning words, The mists of the dawn begin to dislimn Zahàra's castles of sand. Farewell!—farewell! Mine eyes feel dim— They turn to the Lampless Land. 'Llah Hu! My heart is weary—mine eyes are dim— I would rest in the Dark, Dark Land! THE HUNDRED-LEAFÈD ROSE. I am, saith the Rose, as the Voice from the Bush That spake upon Horeb to Mose: Hence hangs, like Manszur, her head with a blush The Hundred-leafèd ROSE. Like crispèd gold, laid fold over sold, Like the sun that at Eventide glows, Like the furnace-bed of Al-Khalill Is the Hundred-leafèd ROSE. Her cloak is green, with a gloomy sheen, Like the garment of beauteous Jose, And prisoned round by a sentinelled wall Is the Hundred-leafèd ROSE. Like Issa, whose breath first woke from Death The souls in this world of woes, She vivifies all the fainting air, The Hundred-leafèd ROSE. Profound as the wells where Harut and Marut Of Babel are hung by the toes, Are the damask deeps where the odour sleeps Of the Hundred-leafèd ROSE. As the Prophet's word in the Solitudes Made the doors of the rock unclose, The Summer's voice unrolls the buds Of the Hundred-leafèd ROSE. Like Solomon's throne in olden years Her crimson richness shews; And the Dives protect with a ring of spears The seal of the sacred ROSE. The Flower of Flowers as a convent towers Where Virtue and Truth repose; The leaves are the halls, and the convent walls Are the thorns that fence the ROSE. Like Balkis Queen for her queenly mien, Like Balkis for queenly clothes, Is the bride of the bowers, the pride of the flowers, The Hundred-leafèd ROSE. Like Daoud King on the psaltery playing, Each wooing Zephyr that goes, At will from flower to flower a-maying, Hath sweetest airs for the ROSE. Who sees the sun set round and red Over Lebanon's brow of snows, May dream how burns in a lily-bed The Hundred-leafèd ROSE. The sun is an archer swift and strong, With a myriad silver bows, And each beam is a barb to pierce the garb Of the Hundred-leafèd ROSE. While the moon all the long, long, spectral night Her light o'er the garden throws, Like a beauty shrinking away from sight Is the Hundred-leafèd ROSE. Like the tears of a maiden, whose heart, ever laden With sorrowful thought, overflows At her weeping eye, are the dews that lie On the feminine cheek of the ROSE. As Man after Fame, as the moth round the flame, As the steer when his partner lows, Is the Nightingale, when his fruitless wail Is poured to the silent ROSE. A Princess tranced by a talisman's power, Who bloomingly slumbers, nor knows That the sorcerer's spell encircles her bower, Is the Hundred-leafèd ROSE. Alas! that her kiosk of emerald rare Should be powerless all to oppose The venom of Serpent Envy's glare When its eye is fixed on the ROSE. A virgin alone in an alien land, Whose friends are but smiling foes, A palace plundered by every hand Is the Hundred-leafèd ROSE. Oh! why should she dwell in a desert dell With the darnel and mandrake?—Those Were never meet mates for her, the proud, The Hundred-leafèd ROSE. In an Eden which Heat hath never consumed, Where Winter-night never froze, Should only bloom, should ever have bloomed, The Hundred-leafèd ROSE. Oh! give her the gardens of Peristan, Where only the musk-wind blows, And where she need fear nor Storm nor Man, The Hundred-leafèd ROSE. For the Summer's hand of love and light In the luminous flowers it strows Earth's valleys withal, drops none so bright As the Hundred-leafèd ROSE. Hail, Suleiman Sultan! Shadow of God! Great Prince, whose bounty bestows And scatters jewels like dust abroad, As the Wind the leaves of the ROSE. The pining world felt sick and sad, And laboured with troubles and throes, Till thine avatar bade all be glad. Like the young Spring's earliest ROSE. Now light is in Heaven and health upon Earth, June joyously comes and goes; Rich Plenty has drowned the remembrance of Dearth, And the Thistle gives way to the ROSE. The shepherd is piping a tune of delight, The husbandman reaps as he sows; The gardens forget the black seasons of blight, And Summer is vain of the ROSE. Reign, Sultan, for ever! and this be thy praise, Though Eulogy overflows With the marvels thy marvellous era displays, That thou raisedst the perishing ROSE. LAMENT. From the Firak-Nameh of Ahi, i.e. the Sigher.) ob. 1520. Like a cypress-tree, Mateless in a death-black valley, Where no lily springeth, Where no bulbul singeth, Whence gazelle is never seen to sally, Such am I; woe is me! Poor, sad, all unknown, Lone, lone, lone! Like a wandering bee, Alien from his hive and fellows, Humming moanful ditties; Far from men and cities, Roaming glades which Autumn rarely mellows, Such am I; woe is me! Poor, sad, all unknown, Lone, lone, lone! Like a bark at sea, All whose crew by night have perished, Drifting on the ocean Still with shoreward motion, Though none live by whom Hope's throb is cherished, Such am I; woe is me! Poor, sad, all unknown, Lone, lone, lone! So I pine and dree Till the night that knows no morrow Sees me wrapped in clay-vest: Thou, chill world, that gavest Me the bitter boon alone of Sorrow, Give, then, a grave to me, Dark, sad, all unknown, Lone, lone, lone! A TRIPLET ON THE REIGN OF THE GREAT SULTAN. By Nedschati. Such are the stillness and peace that prevail through the Sultan's dominions That the dread Angel of Death, when he startles thy couch with his pinions, Can bring thee no stillier peace than is found in the Sultan's dominions. TO MIRIAM, ON HER HAIR. (From the Akad of Kinalisade.) By Selman. ob. 1530. Ethiopian are thy locks; In each hair Lurks a snare Worse than Afric's gulfs and rocks; They who swear By that hair Swear the Koran's oath aright: By the black Abyss of Night! ADVICE. (From the Ottoman.) Traverse not the globe for lore! The sternest But the surest teacher is the heart. Studying that and that alone, thou learnest Best and soonest whence and what thou art. Time, not travel, 'tis which gives us ready Speech, experience, prudence, tact, and wit. Far more light the lamp that bideth steady Than the wandering lantern doth emit. Moor; Chinese, Egyptian, Russian, Roman, Tread one common downhill path of doom: Everywhere the names are Man and Woman, Everywhere the old sad sins find room. Evil angels tempt us in all places. What but sands or snows hath Earth to give? Dream not, friend, of deserts and oäses, But look inwards, and begin to live. ADAM'S OATH. (From the Ottoman.) Medreamt I was in Paradise, and there, a-drinking wine, I saw our Father Adam, with his flowing golden hair— O, Father! was my greeting, my heart is faint with care; Tell me, tell me, are the Mooslemin of Aälya sons of thine? But the Noble Senior frowned, and his wavy golden hair Grew black as clouds at Evening, when thunder thrills the air. No! the Mooslemin of Aälya I disown for sons of mine! Then methought I wept and beat my breast, and begged of him a sign, O, swear it Father Adam! So, dilating out, he sware— If the Mooslemin of Aälyastan be kith or kin of mine Let dust for ever darken the glory of my hair! FRONTI NULLA FIDES. (From the Ottoman.) Beware of blindly trusting To outward art And specious sheen, For Vice is oft encrusting The hollow heart Within unseen. See that black pool below thee! There Heaven sleeps In golden fire, Yet, whatsoe'er they show thee, The mirror's deeps Are slime and mire. LOVE. (From the Turkish.) From Eternity the Course of Love was writ on leaves of Snow, Hence it wanders like a vagrant when the Winds of Coldness blow, And the Lamp of Love is pale and chill where Constancy is weak, And the Lily comes to pine upon deserted Beauty's cheek. From Eternity the Might of Love was writ on leaves of Fire, Hence the Soul of Love in spiral flames would mount for ever higher, And the vermeil Sun of Eden won, leaves Hope no more to seek, And the damask Rose ascends her throne on happy Beauty's cheek. From Eternity the Fate of Love was writ on leaves of Gloom, For the Night of its Decay must come, and Darkness build its tomb, Then the Waste of Life, a Garden once, again is black and bleak, And the Raven Tresses mourningly o'ershadow Beauty's cheek. O! the joys of Love are sweet and false—are sorrows in disguise, Like the cheating wealth of golden Eve, ere Night breaks up the skies. If the graves of Earth were opened—O! if Hades could but speak, What a world of ruined souls would curse the sheen of Beauty's cheek! THE ANGEL OF DEATH. A Persian Legend. I Great Zuleimaun was King of Kings. He ruled o'er Deevs and men. For him had Allah's hand updrawn The veil that shrouds all mystic things. On Earth shall reign agen No King like Zuleimaun! II He sate within his Council-room One morn in Summer-time, And held high converse with Azreel, The Messenger of Death and Doom, On Fate, and Good, and Crime, And future woe and weal: III When, slowly oped the chamber-door, And Meerza Ibrahim, Vezeer, walked in, with tottering pace. The old man's locks showed scant and hoar; His eyes were very dim, And Fear was on his face. IV “O King!” he spake, “I dreamed last night A dream. . . . But who is here?— Ha!—'tis Azreel that blasts mine eyes!”— The Angel vanished out of sight, First giving the Vezeer A look of deep surprise. V “For me!—for me! He comes for me!” The shuddering Meerza cried. “Oh, Master! grant me, I beseech, Thy fleetest barb, that I may flee Into the Desert wide, Beyond his wrath and reach!”— VI “Friend!” spake the Monarch, “dream not thou That clay may war with Fate! Thou canst not baulk the Almighty Will. Man's life is written on his brow, His Life, his Love, his Hate, His endless Bliss or Ill!”— VII “True!” cried the Meerza, “all too true, O King, is that thou sayest, Yet grant me still the boon I crave!”— “'Tis thine!” said Zuleimaun. “But who Shall flee from Doom? Thou mayest Be riding to thy grave!” VIII Began the Meerza then his flight, Borne on his coal-black barb, O'er mount, and mead, and marish dank. Spectators marvelled at the sight, For, from his jewelled garb, All guessed his princely rank. IX And soon as Evening's first faint star Rose on the pallid air, And day was lost in Twilight's gloom, Behold him in the Desert far, His face to earth, in prayer, Anear an open tomb! X There, prostrate, long time doth he kneel, Amid the swarthy sands; Till glancing up all desolate, Lo! sight of sights!—once more Azreel! The Dark-winged Angel stands Beside the tomb's grey gate! XI “And must it be?” the Meerza cries. “Then Allah's will be done! Yet say, before I close my race, Why spake such wonder from thine eyes, This morn, O Dreaded One, When first thou sawest my face?” XII The Angel raised his looks to Heaven. “O, most Mysterious Lord!” He spake, “How hidden be thy ways! O, for the marvel of this even, Let Earth, with one accord, Arise and hymn Thy praise!” XIII Then, turning to that old man lone, “Know, Ibrahim,” he said, “That God foreknew all this as near! He knew that thou, ere moonlight shone, Shouldst rest among the Dead, And bade me wait thee here! XIV “So when, this morn, I met thee in Thy Sovereign's Council-room, I asked myself or why, or how, Thou couldst have nerve or will to win Thy way to this far tomb, And hence my wondering brow. XV “Enough! Thus end all earthly dreams Of Riches and Renown!”— . . . His hand just touched his victim's face, And in an hour the moon's blue beams Were glancing coldly down On Ibrahim's burial-place. TO MIHRI. (From the Persian.) My starlight, my moonlight, my midnight, my noonlight, Unveil not, unveil not! or millions must pine. Ah, didst thou lay bare those dark tresses of thine, Even night would seem bright To the hue of thy hair, Which is black as despair! My starlight, my moonlight, my midnight, my noonlight, Unveil not, unveil not! or millions must pine. Ah, didst thou disclose those bright features of thine, The Red Vale would look pale By thy cheek which so glows That it shames the rich rose! My starlight, my moonlight, my midnight, my noonlight, Unveil not, unveil not! or millions must pine. Ah, didst thou lay bare that white bosom of thine, The bright sun would grow dim Nigh a rival so rare And so radiantly fair! My starlight, my moonlight, my midnight, my noonlight. Unveil not! Unveil not! THE WORLD—A GHAZEL. (From the Ottoman.) To this Khan, and from this Khan, How many pilgrims came and went, too! In this Khan—and by this Khan What arts were spent—what hearts were rent, to! To this Khan—and from this Khan Which for penance man is sent to, Many a van and caravan Crowded came—and shrouded went, too! Christian man and Moslem man, Guebre, Heathen, Jew, and Gentoo, To this Khan—and from this Khan Weeping came and weeping went, too! A riddle this since time began Which many a sage his mind hath bent to. All came and went, but never man Knew whence they came or where they went to. HEAVEN FIRST OF ALL WITHIN OURSELVES. (From the Ottoman.) I stood where the home of my boyhood had been, In the Bellflower Vale, by the Lake of Bir-ból; And I pensively gazed on the wreck of a scene Which the dreams of the Past made so dear to my soul. For its light had grown dim while I wandered afar, And its glories had vanished, like leaves on the gale, And the frenzy of Man and the tempests of War Had laid prostrate the pride of my Bellflower Vale. I thought how long years of disaster and woe Scarce woke in my bosom one sigh for the Past, How my hopes, like the home of my childhood, lay low, While the spirit within remained calm to the last. Then I looked on the lake that lay deep in the dell As pellucidly fair as in summers gone by, And amid the sad ruins of cottage and cell Still mirrored the beautiful face of the sky. And I said, So may Ruin o'ertake all we love, And our minds like Bir-ból, abide bright evermore; So the heart that in grief looks to Allah above, Still reflects the same heaven from its depths as before! LEARNING. (From the Ottoman.) See how those worlds that roll afar Serenely beam on one another! There nowhere burns a sun or star But helps to cheer some darker brother. Wouldst thou, O man! be good and wise, Share thus thy light among thy neighbours: In giving, not in hoarding, lies The truest meed of Learning's labours! GOOD COUNSEL. (From the Ottoman.) Tutor not thyself in science: go to masters for perfection; Also speak thy thoughts aloud: Whoso in the glass beholdeth nought besides his own reflection Bides both ignorant and proud. Study not in one book only: bee-like, rather, at a hundred Sources gather honeyed lore: Thou art else that helpless bird which, when her nest has once been plundered, Ne'er can build another more. AN EPITAPH. (From the Persian.) Rests within this lonely mausoléum, After Life's distractions and fatigue, Leeh Rewáán, a man to hear and see whom Monks and Meerzas journeyed many a league. Yet not Leeh Rewáán himself, but rather Leeh Rewáán's worn-out and cast-off dress; He, the Man, dwells with his Heavenly Father In a land of light and loveliness. Shah of Song he was, and fond of laughter, Sweet sharaab, and silver-spangled shawls. Stranger! mayest thou quaff with him hereafter Life's red wine in Eden's palace-halls! RELIC OF SULTAN AMURATH II. (From the Ottoman.) A score and ten fleeting years I swayed This world as its Master, And mine was the Palace thereof, with its halls: I deemed them eternal—but now, dismayed, I see arch and pilaster Evanish in mist, while the cupola falls, And is blent with the dust where my slain hopes are laid, And the rotting pilaster Drops piecemeal away from the naked walls!— O wretched, saith Amurad Abuzade, The man whom Disaster, Unlooked for and fierce, in the Night-time befals! LINES ON THE LAUNCHING OF THE BASHTARDAH. (From the Ottoman.) “Weigh anchor!” cried the Padishah, “Quick! ere the day be a moment older, And launch the peerless Bashtardah! No nobler vessel sails, or bolder.” Who hear the order must obey: they get the Proud one under weigh, And along her dark blue road she sweeps— The Jewel of the world—behold her! Walking the Bosphorus like a queen, Unparalleled and uncontrolled, her Green flag will centuries hence be seen When kiosks and mosques and deereks moulder. Let Venice' galleys menace now—armed all and manned from poop to prow; There goes the empress of the seas! The Jewel of the World—behold her! Long as her gallant main-mast towers, Long as the joyous waves uphold her, So long her crew will dare the Giaours, Will meet them shoulder up to shoulder— O the days of Selim shall return—again the Moslem's breast shall burn, Pondering what Marmora was of yore When rich in such—our boast—behold her! Cold is the Captain-Pasha's lay, But may his heart be even colder, May his eyes and mouth be filled with clay, And a winding-sheet be his enfolder, When he shall see, with heedless eye, yon glorious pennon flout the sky! It is her pennon—there she goes! The Jewel of the World—behold her! GHAZEL. (From the Poems of Ahmedi. Ob. 1412.) Red are her cheeks like rubies, so red that every night, Despairing to outglow them, the sun withdraws from sight. All day I drink this ruby wine, those rubies rich and bright, But these distil in pearls that fill my dim eyes every night. The nightingale rebukes me; he says my song is trite; But can I sing when tortures wring my bosom night by night? While others woo her in their dreams and slumbers of delight, I groan and weep, I cannot sleep, I weep the livelong night. Oh! I am slain with deadly pain—slain, slain with pain outright, That on her breast her locks should rest so softly all the night. Of Ahmed's tears and torments, and love's unhappy blight The lamp will tell that in his cell burns lower night by night. VOLTO SCIOLTO E PENSIERI STRETTI. Lock up thy heart within thy breast alway, And wear it not as bait upon thy face, For there be more devouring beasts of prey Than haunt the woods among the human race. WHAT IS LOVE? What is Love? I asked a lover— Liken it, he answered, weeping, To a flood unchained and sweeping Over shell-strewn grottoes, over Beds of roses, lilies, tulips, O'er all flowers that most enrich the Garden, in one headlong torrent, Till they shew a wreck from which the Eye and mind recoil abhorrent. Hearts may woo hearts, lips may woo lips, And gay days be spent in gladness, Dancing, feasting, lilting, luting, But the end of all is Sadness, Desolation, Devastation, Spoliation and Uprooting! JEALOUSY. (From the Ottoman.) “My darling, tiny, little girl, I'll give thee jewelled shoes and dresses, I'll give thee zones of silk and pearl: And tell me who has combed thy hair? I'll give thee kisses and caresses, And say, what youth has combed thy hair?” “O, by my word! O, by my truth! O, by the life of Ali Shah! Aminah knows no other youth. By all the times that thou hast kissed her, Her hair was combed by Zillalah, Her own beloved sister!” “My own, my whitest girl, I vow I'll bring thee sweetmeats sugared newly; And tell me, only tell me now, Who over-darked thine eyes with kohl?” My white Aminah, tell me truly, Who over-darked thine eyes with kohl?” “O, by my word! O, by my soul! O, by the soul of Ali Shah! Myself o'er-darked mine eyes with kohl! 'Twas given me by my own dear mother, My whitest mother, Fatimah: I had it from none other.” “My playful girl, I'll give thee rings, And gold, and gems beyond comparing; I'll give thee thousand costly things! And say, who bit those lips of thine? Come, tell what Kuzzilbash so daring Hath bitten those red lips of thine?” “O, by my love! O, by my life! 'Twas by a bright red rose this morn Give me by Zayde, my brother's wife, These guiltless lips of mine were bitten. (For brightest rose hath sharpest thorn: This, as thou knowest, is written).” “Thou crafty girl, I know thine art! Dread thou my wrath: I give thee warning. But if thou wouldst regain my heart Speak, tell me who has torn thy shawl! Say what young Galionjee this morning Tore thus in twain thy scarlet shawl? “O faithless, truthless, worthless jade! I have tracked thee, then, thro' all thy lying. Away! No jewels, no brocade, No sweetmeats shalt thou have of me. Away, false girl! thy tears and sighing Seem worse than even thy lies to be!” TRANSORANIAN PHILOSOPHY. Make the round world thy Book of Examples! Man and his mind are a study for sages: He who would mount to the firmament tramples Under his feet the experience of ages. Love what thou hast with a willing devotion! Drink of the stream, if thou meet not the fountain! Though the best pearls lie low in the ocean, Gold is at hand in the mines of the mountain! A NEW MOON. (From the Ottoman.) Darksome through the Night of Separation Unto two fond hearts must ever prove, Those twin sorcerers, Hope—Imagination— Raise a moon up from the Well of Love. LAMII'S APOLOGY FOR HIS NONSENSE. (From the Ottoman.) I was a parrot mute and happy, till Once on a time, The fowlers pierced the wood and caught me. Then blame me not; for I but echo still In wayward rhyme The melancholy wit they taught me. TO SULTAN MURAD II. (From the Ottoman.) Earth sees in thee Her Destiny: Thou standest as the Pole—and she Resembles The Needle, for she turns to thee, And trembles. TO AMINE, ON SEEING HER ABOUT TO VEIL HER MIRROR. (From the Ottoman.) Veil not thy mirror, sweet Amine, Till Night shall also veil each star; Thou see'st a two-fold marvel there— The only face as fair as thine, The only eyes that near or far Can gaze on thine without despair! SAYING OF NEDSCHATI. (From the Ottoman.) ob. 1508. The world is one vast caravanserai, Where none may stay, But where each guest writes on the wall this word, O Mighty Lord! FOUR PROVERBS. (From the Ottoman.) I An hour of Good, a day of Ill, This is the lot of mourning Man, Who leaves the world whene'er he will, But goes to Heaven whene'er he—can. II The steed to the man who bestrides it newly, The sabre to him who best can wield it, The damsel to him who has wooed her truly, And the province to him who refuses to yield it. III Thy thoughts are but Silver when told; Locked up in thy breast they are Gold. IV Nought, I hear thee say, Can fill the greedy eye; Yet a little clay Will fill it by and by. SAYINGS OF DJELIM. (From the Fazel-Nameh of Schinasi, or the Knowing One. ob. 1627.) (From the Ottoman.) I, too, was reared in Djelim's house; and thus his precepts run and are: When Folly sells thee Wisdom's crown, 'tis idly gained and dearly bought: O! foremost man of all his race, born under some diviner star, Who, early trained, self-reined, self-chained, can practise all that Lokman taught, The joys and cares of Earth are snares: Heed lest thy soul too late deplore The power of Sin to wile and win her vision from the Eight and Four. Lock up thyself within thyself; distrust the Stranger and the Fair; The fool is blown from whim to whim by every gust of Passion's gales; Bide where the lute and song are mute; and—as thy soul would shun despair— Avert thine eyes from Woman's face when Twilight falls and she unveils. Be circumspect; be watchmanlike; put pebbles in thy mouth each day; Pause long ere thou panegyrise; pause doubly long ere thou condemn. Thy thoughts are Tartars, vagabonds; imprison all thou canst not slay. Of many million drops of rain perchance but one turns out a gem. RELIC OF PRINCE BAYAZEED SHAHI. (From the Ottoman.) Slow through my bosom's veins their last cold blood is flowing, Above my heart even now I feel the rank grass growing. Hence to the Land of Nought! the caravan is starting— Its bell already tolls the signal of departing. Rejoice, my soul! Poor bird, thou art at last delivered! Thy cage is crumbling fast; its bars will soon be shivered. Farewell, thou troubled world, where Sin and Crime run riot, For Shahi henceforth rests in God's own House of Quiet! DOUBLE TROUBLE. (From the Ottoman.) I am blinded by thy hair and by thy tears together— The dark night and the rain come down on me together. ARCHERS AND ARCHES. (From the Ottoman.) Turn away those eye-brows, Archer of the glossy ebon bow! Look not thus on my brows! Mine are clouds that dull the orbs below, Or deserted bridges, Underneath whose dreary arches flow, In unresting ridges, Evermore the waters of deep woe. RELIC OF YUSUF SHEICKI. (From the Ottoman.) What a senseless dream of the reason of Man, To think it can rifle the Great Caravan Of Allah's inscrutable Will and Existence; When the tinkling tones of the Caravan-bell, As the Caravan moves through the misty Dell Of the world, are themselves half-lost in the Distance, A NONDESCRIPT. (From the Ottoman.) I scarce know how, in verse or prose, For listener's ear or eye of reader, To give my Lulu's form its merit; For when she sits, she seems a Rose, And when she stands, a queenly Cedar, And when she moves, a Peri-spirit. EFFECTS OF LAZINESS. (From the Ottoman.) I left the Fabric of my Hopes to other hands to rear; It fell, and then I wept for grief, and wondered at its fall. Be wiser thou, one Hand hath framed the Universal All; That wrought alone; do thou the same, or swift Decay is near! JUSTICE ALONE IS ETERNAL. (From the Ottoman.) Tyrant! With sweat of man, with widows' tears, With orphans' blood Thou moistenest the accursed clay Of the proud palace walls thine avarice rears. And callest thou thine evil good! Yet what avail thy triumphs? Look at the decay Of the serais of Afrazeeb! Long years Hath darkness wrapped these in a ten-fold hood; And owls hoot in their chambers night and day! Only those Gates which no soul nears Except by Penance' road and over Sorrow's flood, Those Gates through which thou canst not find thy way Those only, and the burning marble piers Of Iblis' halls—as they have stood From immemorial time—shall stand for aye! RELIC OF SERVI. When the mourner sits at the Feast of Woe, The wine is gall and the lights burn low. How bounded my heart in my younger years, Ere Grief had unlocked the fount of my tears! Now dead are the roses of Hope and their bloom, And those that I loved are dust in the tomb; And of all that gave Servi pleasure or pain, His songs and his sorrows alone remain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART V. OVERSETTINGS FROM THE GERMAN. ALEXANDER AND THE TREE. (De La Motte Fouqué.) The sun is bright, the air is bland, The heavens wear that stainless blue, Which only in an Orient land The eye of man may view; And lo! around, and all abroad, A glittering host, a mighty horde— And at their head a demigod Who slays with lightning sword! The bright noon burns, but idly now Those warriors rest by copse and hill, And shadows on their Leader's brow Seem ominous of ill. Spell-bound, he stands beside a tree, And well he may, for through its leaves, Unstirred by wind, come brokenly Moans, as of one that grieves! How strange! he thought—Life is a boon Given, and resumed—but how? and when? But now I asked myself how soon I should go home agen! How soon I might once more behold My mourning mother's tearful face; How soon my kindred might enfold Me in their dear embrace! There was an Indian Magian there— And, stepping forth, he bent his knee: “O king!” he said, “be wise!—beware This too prophetic tree!” “Ha!” cried the king, “thou knowest then, Seer, What yon strange oracle reveals?” “Alas!” the Magian said, “I hear Deep words, like thunder peals! “I hear the groans of more than Man, Hear tones that warn, denounce, beseech; Hear—woe is me!—how darkly ran That stream of thrilling speech! ‘O king,’ it spake, ‘all-trampling king! Thou leadest legions from afar; But Battle droops his clotted wing! Night menaces thy star! “‘Fond visions of thy boyhood's years Dawn like dim light upon thy soul; Thou seest again thy mother's tears, Which Love could not control! Ah! thy career, in sooth, is run! Ah! thou indeed returnest home! The Mother waits to clasp her son Low in her lampless dome! “‘Yet go, rejoicing! He who reigns O'er Earth alone leaves worlds unscanned; Life binds the spirit as with chains; Seek thou the Phantom Land! Leave Conquest all it looks for here, Leave willing slaves a bloody throne; Thine henceforth is another sphere, Death's realm, the dark Unknown!’” The Magian paused; the leaves were hushed, But wailings broke from all around, Until the Chief, whose red blood flushed His cheek with hotter bound, Asked, in the tones of one with whom Fear never yet had been a guest— “And when doth Fate achieve my doom? And where shall be my rest?” “Oh, noble heart!” the Magian said, And tears unbidden filled his eyes, “We should not weep for thee!—the Dead Change but their home and skies: The moon shall beam, the myrtles bloom For thee no more—yet sorrow not! The immortal pomp of Hades' gloom Best consecrates thy lot.” NOON-DAY DREAMING. (Müller.) There danceth adown the mountain The Child of a lofty race, A Streamlet fresh from its Fountain Hies towards the valley apace. Some Fairy hath whispered “Follow!” And I have obeyed her well: I thread the Blossomy Hollow With my pilgrim-staff and shell. On, on, behold me straying, And ever beside the stream, As I list its murmurous playing And mark how its wavelets gleam. Can this be the path I intended? O, Sorceress! what shall I say? Thy dazzle and music blended Have wiled my reason away! No mortal sounds are winging Their wonted way along; Oh, no! some Naiad is singing A flattering Summer-song! TO THE BELOVED ONE. (Heine.) O, why are the roses so drooping and pale? My sweet, wilt thou whisper me why? O, why, my beloved, in the heart of the vale, Do the violets languish and die? And why with so plaintive and wailing a sound Goes singing the lark in the skies? Or why from the odorous blossoms around Should the scents of the charnel arise? And why will the sun the green valley below Thus wanly and dully illume? O, why should the earth like a wilderness show? And as vacant of soul as a tomb? And why am I, too, so dejected and lone? O, loved of my bosom, canst tell? My richest of treasures, my beautiful one, O, why dost thou bid me farewell? THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER. (Eichendorff.) The mill wheel turns with a saddening sound— I hear it each morning early, When the sun arises red and round, And the flower cups glisten so pearly. The miller's daughter is gone away, And oh! most bodeful wonder, The ring she gave me on Valentine's day Sprang yestereven asunder! No longer now may I linger here; I'll don the willow, and till grim Death shall at length arrest my career I'll wander about as a pilgrim. I'll wander with lute from bower unto hall, From shepherd's dell unto city, Compelling tears from the eyes of all Who shall hearken my doleful ditty. The mill wheel turns in the early morn, I hear both wheel and water; And I turn, too—away, forlorn, For I think of the miller's daughter. That wheel shall turn and turn again, Re-turn, re-turn, forever; But the miller's faithless daughter, when Shall she return? Ah, never! BREADTH AND DEPTH. (Schiller) Gentry there be who don't figure in History; Yet they are clever, too—deucedly!— All that is puzzling, all tissues of mystery They will unravel you lucidly. Hear their oracular dicta but thrown out, You'd fancy these Wise Men of Gotham must find the Philosophers' Stone out! Yet they quit Earth without signal and voicelessly; All their existence was vanity. He seldom speaks—he deports himself noiselessly Who would enlighten Humanity: Lone, unbeheld, he by slow, but incessant Exertion, extracts for the Future the pith of the Past and the Present. Look at yon tree, spreading like a pavilion! See How it shines, shadows and flourishes! Not in its leaves, though all odour and brilliancy, Seek we the sweet fruit that nourishes. No! a dark prison encloses the kernel Whence shoots with round bole and broad boughs the green giant whose youth looks eternal! THE RIDE ROUND THE PARAPET. (Rückert.) She said, “I was not born to mope at home in loneliness,”— The Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. She said, “I was not born to mope at home in loneliness, When the heart is throbbing sorest there is balsam in the forest, There is balsam in the forest for its pain,” Said the Lady Eleanora, Said the Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. She doffed her silks and pearls, and donned instead her hunting-gear, The Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. She doffed her silks and pearls, and donned instead her hunting-gear, And, till Summer-time was over, as a huntress and a rover, Did she couch upon the mountain and the plain, She, the Lady Eleanora, Noble Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. Returning home again, she viewed with scorn the tournaments— The Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. Returning home again, she viewed with scorn the tournaments; She saw the morions cloven and the crowning chaplets woven, And the sight awakened only the disdain Of the Lady Eleanora, Of the Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. “My feeling towards Man is one of utter scornfulness,” Said Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. “My feeling towards Man is one of utter scornfulness, And he that would o'ercome it, let him ride around the summit Of my battlemented Castle by the Maine,” Said the Lady Eleanora, Said the Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. So came a knight anon to ride around the parapet, For Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. So came a knight anon to ride around the parapet, Man and horse were hurled together o'er the crags that beetled nether— Said the Lady, “There, I fancy, they'll remain!” Said the Lady Eleanora, Queenly Lady Eleanora von Alleyne! Then came another knight to ride around the parapet, For Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. Then came another knight to ride around the parapet, Man and horse fell down, asunder, o'er the crags that beetled under— Said the Lady, “They'll not leap the leap again!” Said the Lady Eleanora, Lovely Lady Eleanora von Alleyne! Came other knights anon to ride around the parapet, For Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. Came other knights anon to ride around the parapet, Till six-and-thirty corses of both mangled men and horses Had been sacrificed as victims at the fane Of the Lady Eleanora, Stately Lady Eleanora von Alleyne! That woeful year went by, and Ritter none came afterwards To Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. That woeful year was by, and Ritter none came afterwards; The Castle's lonely basscourt looked a wild o'ergrown-with-grasscourt; 'Twas abandoned by the Ritters and their train To the Lady Eleanora, Haughty Lady Eleanora von Alleyne! She clomb the silent wall, she gazed around her sovran-like, The Lady Eleanora von Alleyne! She clomb the silent wall, she gazed around her sovran-like; “And wherefore have departed all the Brave, the Lion-hearted, Who have left me here to play the Castellain?” Said the Lady Eleanora, Said the Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. “And is it fled for aye, the palmy time of Chivalry?” Cried Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. “And is it fled for aye, the palmy time of Chivalry? Shame light upon the cravens! May their corses gorge the ravens, Since they tremble thus to wear a woman's chain!” Said the Lady Eleanora, Said the Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. The story reached at Gratz the gallant Margrave Gondibert Of Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. The story reached at Gratz the gallant Margrave Gondibert. Quoth he, “I trow the woman must be more or less than human; She is worth a little peaceable campaign, Is the Lady Eleanora, Is the Lady Eleanora von Alleyne!” He trained a horse to pace round narrow stones laid merlonwise, For Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. He trained a horse to pace round narrow stones laid merlonwise— “Good Grey! do thou thy duty, and this rocky-bosomed beauty Shall be taught that all the vauntings are in vain Of the Lady Eleanora, Of the Lady Eleanora von Alleyne!” He left his castle-halls, he came to Lady Eleanor's, The Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. He left his castle-halls, he came to Lady Eleanor's. “O lady, best and fairest, here am I,—and, if thou carest, I will gallop round the parapet amain, Noble Lady Eleanora, Noble Lady Eleanora von Alleyne.” She saw him spring to horse, that gallant Margrave Gondibert, The Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. She saw him spring to horse, that gallant Margrave Gondibert. “O, bitter, bitter sorrow! I shall weep for this to-morrow! It were better that in battle he were slain,” Said the Lady Eleanora, Said the Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. Then rode he round and round the battlemented parapet, For Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. Then rode he round and round the battlemented parapet; The Lady wept and trembled, and her paly face resembled, As she looked away, a lily wet with rain; Hapless Lady Eleanora! Hapless Lady Eleanora von Alleyne! So rode he round and round the battlemented parapet, For Lady Eleanora von Alleyne! So rode he round and round the battlemented parapet; “Accurst be my ambition! He but rideth to perdition, He but rideth to perdition without rein!” Wept the Lady Eleanora, Wept the Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. Yet rode he round and round the battlemented parapet, For Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. Yet rode he round and round the battlemented parapet. Meanwhile her terror shook her—yea, her breath well-nigh forsook her, Fire was burning in the bosom and the brain Of the Lady Eleanora, Of the Lady Eleanora von Alleyne! Then rode he round and off the battlemented parapet To Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. Then rode he round and off the battlemented parapet. “Now blest be God for ever! This is marvellous! I never Cherished hope of laying eyes on thee again!” Cried the Lady Eleanora, Joyous Lady Eleanora von Alleyne! “The Man of Men thou art, for thou hast truly conquered me, The Lady Eleanora von Alleyne! The Man of Men thou art, for thou hast fairly conquered me. I greet thee as my lover, and, ere many days be over, Thou shalt wed me and be Lord of my domain,” Said the Lady Eleanora, Said the Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. Then bowed the graceful knight, the gallant Margrave Gondibert, To Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. Then bowed that graceful knight, the gallant Margrave Gondibert, And thus he answered coldly, “There be many who as boldly Will adventure an achievement they disdain, For the Lady Eleanora, For the Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. “Mayest bide until they come, O stately Lady Eleanor! O Lady Eleanora von Alleyne! Mayest bide until they come, O stately Lady Eleanor! And thou and they may marry, but, for me, I must not tarry; I have won a wife already out of Spain, Virgin Lady Eleanora, Virgin Lady Eleanora von Alleyne!” Thereon he rode away, the gallant Margrave Gondibert. From Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. Thereon he rode away, the gallant Margrave Gondibert. And long in shame and anguish did that haughty Lady languish, Did she languish without pity for her pain She the Lady Eleanora, She the Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. And year went after year, and still in barren maidenhood Lived Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. And wrinkled Eld crept on, and still her lot was maidenhood, And, woe! her end was tragic; she was changed, at length, by magic, To an ugly wooden image, they maintain; She, the Lady Eleanora, She, the Lady Eleanora von Alleyne! And now before the gate, in sight of all, transmogrified, Stands Lady Eleanora von Alleyne. Before her castle-gate, in sight of all, transmogrified, And he that won't salute her must be fined in foaming pewter, If a boor—but if a burgher, in champagne, For the Lady Eleanora, Wooden Lady Eleanora von Alleyne! NATURE MORE THAN SCIENCE. (Rückert.) I have a thousand thousand lays, Compact of myriad myriad words, And so can sing a million ways, Can play at pleasure on the chords Of tunèd harp or heart; Yet is there one sweet song For which in vain I pine and long; I cannot reach that song, with all my minstrel art. A shepherd sits within a dell, O'er-canopied from rain and heat; A shallow but pellucid well Doth ever bubble at his feet. His pipe is but a leaf, Yet there above that stream, He plays and plays, as in a dream, One air that steals away the senses like a thief. A simple air it seems in truth, And who begins will end it soon; Yet when that hidden shepherd youth So pours it in the ear of Noon, Tears flow from those anear. All songs of yours and mine Condensed in one were less divine Than that sweet air to sing, that sweet, sweet air to hear! 'Twas yesternoon he played it last; The hummings of a hundred bees Were in mine ears, yet, as I passed, I heard him through the myrtle trees. Stretched all along he lay, 'Mid foliage half-decayed. His lambs were feeding while he played, And sleepily wore on the stilly Summer day. AND THEN NO MORE. (Rückert.) I saw her once, one little while, and then no more: 'Twas Eden's light on Earth awhile, and then no more. Amid the throng she passed along the meadow-floor: Spring seemed to smile on Earth awhile, and then no more; But whence she came, which way she went, what garb she wore I noted not; I gazed awhile, and then no more! I saw her once, one little while, and then no more: 'Twas Paradise on Earth awhile, and then no more. Ah! what avail my vigils pale, my magic lore? She shone before mine eyes awhile, and then no more. The shallop of my peace is wrecked on Beauty's shore. Near Hope's fair isle it rode awhile, and then no more! I saw her once, one little while, and then no more: Earth looked like Heaven a little while, and then no more. Her presence thrilled and lighted to its inner core My desert breast a little while, and then no more. So may, perchance, a meteor glance at midnight o'er Some ruined pile a little while, and then no more! I saw her once, one little while, and then no more: The earth was Peri-land awhile, and then no more. Oh, might I see but once again, as once before, Through chance or wile, that shape awhile, and then no more! Death soon would heal my griefs! This heart, now sad and sore, Would beat anew a little while, and then no more. GONE IN THE WIND. (Rückert.) Solomon! where is thy throne? It is gone in the wind. Babylon! where is thy might? It is gone in the wind. Like the swift shadows of Noon, like the dreams of the Blind, Vanish the glories and pomps of the earth in the wind. Man! canst thou build upon aught in the pride of thy mind? Wisdom will teach thee that nothing can tarry behind; Though there be thousand bright actions embalmed and enshrined, Myriads and millions of brighter are snow in the wind. Solomon! where is thy throne? It is gone in the wind. Babylon! where is thy might? It is gone in the wind. All that the genius of Man hath achieved or designed Waits but its hour to be dealt with as dust by the wind. Say, what is Pleasure? A phantom, a mask undefined; Science? An almond, whereof we can pierce but the rind; Honour and Affluence? Firmans that Fortune hath signed Only to glitter and pass on the wings of the wind. Solomon! where is thy throne? It is gone in the wind. Babylon! where is thy might? It is gone in the wind. Who is the Fortunate? He who in anguish hath pined! He shall rejoice when his relics are dust in the wind! Mortal! be careful with what thy best hopes are entwined; Woe to the miners for Truth—where the Lampless have mined! Woe to the seekers on earth for—what none ever find! They and their trust shall be scattered like leaves on the wind. Solomon! where is thy throne? It is gone in the wind. Babylon! where is thy might? It is gone in the wind. Happy in death are they only whose hearts have consigned All Earth's affections and longings and cares to the wind. Pity, thou, reader! the madness of poor Humankind, Raving of Knowledge,—and Satan so busy to blind! Raving of Glory,—like me,—for the garlands I bind (Garlands of song) are but gathered, and—strewn in the wind! Solomon! where is thy throne? It is gone in the wind. Babylon! where is thy might? It is gone in the wind. I, Abul-Namez, must rest; for my fire hath declined, And I hear voices from Hades like bells on the wind. THE POET. (Rückert.) Yes! true Poetry is wizard power; 'Tis the felt enchantment of the heart— But the Poet, what is he? Enchanted Or Enchanter? Master of his art Or but Slave? Haunts he the World soul Tower? Or is he himself the world soul haunted? DISAPPOINTMENT. (Rückert.) Because a chance hath overset Thy House of Cards, thou grievest!—why so? Since thou thyself art standing yet, Thou hast no cause to sigh and cry so. Besides, thou mayest, if thou but will, Construct a nobler dome at leisure: The cards are on the table still, And only wait the builder's pleasure! THE FAIRIES' PASSAGE. (Kopisch.) I Tap, tap! Rap, rap! “Get up, Gaffer Ferryman!” —“Eh? Who is there?”—The clock strikes three.— “Get up—do, Gaffer! You are the very man We have been long, long, longing to see.” The Ferryman rises, growling and grumbling, And goes fum-fumbling, and stumbling—and tumbling Over the wares in his way to the door; But he sees no more Than he saw before, Till a voice is heard—“O, Ferryman, dear! Here we are waiting, all of us, here! We are a wee, wee colony, we, Some two hundred in all, or three— Ferry us over the River Spree Ere dawn of day, And we will pay The most we may In our own wee way!” II “Who are you? Whence came you? What place are you going to?” —“Oh, we have dwelt overlong in this land. The people get cross, and are growing so knowing, too! Nothing at all but they now understand. We are daily vanishing under the thunder Of some huge engine or iron wonder— That iron—oh, it has entered our souls!” —“Your souls? O Goles! You queer little drolls! Do you mean—?” “Good Gaffer, do aid us with speed, For our time, like our stature, is short indeed! And a very long way we have to go, Eight or ten thousand miles or so, Hither and thither, and to and fro, With our pots and pans, And little gold cans; But our light caravans Run swifter than Man's!” III “Well, well, you may come!” said the Ferryman affably; —“Peter! turn out and get ready the barge!” Then again to the Little Folks—“Though you seem laughably Small, I don't mind, if your hellers be large!” Oh, dear! what a rushing, what pushing, what crushing (The Waterman making vain efforts at hushing The hubbub the while) there followed these words! What clappings of boards! What strappings of cords! What stowings away of children and wives, And platters, and mugs, and spoons, and knives! Till all had been safely got into the boat, And the Ferryman, clad in his ten-caped coat, And his wee little farers were fairly afloat. Then ding! ding! ding! And kling! kling! kling! How the hellers did ring In the tin pitcherling! IV Off then went the boat, at first very pleasantly, Smoothly and so forth, but after a while It swayed and it swagged this and that way, and presently Chest after chest, and pile after pile, Of the Little Folks' goods began tossing and rolling And pitching like fun, beyond fairy controlling! O Mab! if the hubbub was great before, It was now some two or three million times more; Crash went the wee crocks, and the clocks—and the locks Of each little box were stove in by hard knocks. And then there were oaths, and prayers and cries— “Take care!”—“See there!”—“Oh, dear! my eyes!” “I am killed”—“I am drowned”—with groans and sighs.— Till the land is in view— “Yeo, ho! Pull to!— Tiller rope thro' and thro'!” —And all's right anew. V “Now, jump upon shore, ye queer little oddities!— . . . Eh! What is this? Where are they at all? Where are they, and where are their tiny commodities? Well! as I live!” He looks blank as a wall, The poor Ferryman! Round him and round him he gazes, But only gets deeplier lost in the mazes Of utter bewilderment! All, all are gone— And he stands alone, Like a statue of stone, In a doldrum of wonder! He turns to steer, And a tinkling laugh salutes his ear With other odd sounds—“Ha! ha! ha! ha! Tol, lol, zid—ziddle—quee—quee—bah! bah! Fizzigigiggidy—psha—sha! sha!” —“O ye thieves! ye thieves! ye rascally thieves!” The good man cries. He turns to his pitcher, And there, alas! to his horror perceives That the Little Folks' mode of making him richer Has been, to pay him with—withered leaves! GRABBE. (Freiligrath.) There stood I in the Camp. 'Twas when the setting sun Was crimsoning the tents of the Hussars. The booming of the Evening-gun Broke on mine ear. A few stray stars Shone out, like silverblank medallions Paving a sapphire floor. Then flowed in unison the tones Of many hautboys, bugles, drums, trombones, And fifes, from twenty-two battalions. They played, “Give glory unto God our Lord!” A solemn strain of music and sublime, That bade Imagination hail a coming time, When universal Mind shall break the slaying sword, And Sin and Wrong and Suffering shall depart An Earth which Christian love shall turn to Heaven. A dream!—yet still I listened, and my heart Grew tranquil as that Summer-even. But soon uprose pale Hecate—she who trances The skies with deathly light. Her beams fell wan, but mild, On the long lines of tents, on swords and lances, And on the pyramids of musquets piled Around. Then sped from rank to rank The signal-order, “Tzako ab!” The music ceased to play. The stillness of the grave ensued. I turned away. Again my memory's tablets showed a saddening blank! Meanwhile another sort of scene Was acted at the Outposts. Carelessly I strolled, In quest of certain faces, into the Canteen. Here wine and brandy, hot or cold, Passed round. At one long table Fredericks-d'or Glittered à qui mieux mieux with epaulettes, And, heedless of the constant call, “Who sets?” Harpwomen played and sang old ballads by the score. I sought an inner chamber. Here sat some Dragoons and Yagers, who conversed, or gambled, Or drank. The dice-box rattled on a drum. I chose a seat apart. My speculations rambled. Scarce even a passive listener or beholder, I mused: “Give glory—” “Qui en veut?”—The sound Came from the drum-head. I had half turned round When some one touched me on the shoulder. “Ha!—is it you?” “None other.” “Well!—what news? How goes it in Mulhausen?” Queries without end Succeed, and I reply as briefly as I chuse. An hour flies by. “Now then, adieu, my friend!” “Stay!—tell me—” “Quick! I am off to Rouge et Noir.”— “Well—one short word, and then Good Night!— Grabbe?”—“Grabbe? He is dead. Wait: let me see. Ay, right! We buried him on Friday last. Bon soir!” An icy thrill ran through my veins. Dead! Buried! Friday last!—and here!—His grave Profaned by vulgar feet! Oh, Noble, Gifted, Brave! Bard of The Hundred Days—was this to be thy fate indeed? I wept; yet not because Life's galling chains No longer bound thy spirit to this barren earth; I wept to think of thy transcendent worth And genius—and of what had been their meed! I wandered forth into the spacious Night, Till the first feelings of my heart had spent Their bitterness. Hours passed. There was an Uhlan tent At hand. I entered. By the moon's blue light I saw some arms and baggage and a heap Of straw. Upon this last I threw My weary limbs. In vain! The moanful night-winds blew About my head and face, and Memory banished Sleep. All night he stood, as I had seen him last, Beside my couch. Had he indeed forsaken The tomb? Or, did I dream, and should I waken? My thoughts flowed like a river, dark and fast. Again I gazed on that columnar brow: “Deserted House! of late so bright with vividest flashes Of Intellect and Passion, can it be that thou Art now a mass of sparkless ashes? “Those ashes once were watch-fires, by whose gleams The glories of the Hohenstauffen race, And Italy's shrines, and Greece's hallowed streams Stood variously revealed—now, softly, as the face Of Night illumined by her silver Lamp— Now, burning with a deep and living lustre, Like the high beacon-lights that stud this Camp, Here, far apart,—there, in a circular cluster. “This Camp! Ah, yes! methinks it images well What thou hast been, thou lonely Tower!— Moonbeams and lamplight mingled—the deep choral swell Of Music in her peals of proudest power, And then—the tavern dice-box rattle! The Grand and the Familiar fought Within thee for the mastery; and thy depth of thought And play of wit made every conflict a drawn battle! “And, oh! that such a mind, so rich, so overflowing With ancient lore and modern phantasy, And prodigal of its treasures as a tree Of golden leaves when Autumn winds are blowing, That such a mind, made to illume and glad All minds, all hearts, should have itself become Affliction's chosen Sanctuary and Home!— This is in truth most marvellous and sad! “Alone the Poet lives—alone he dies. Cain-like, he bears the isolating brand Upon his brow of sorrow. True, his hand Is pure from blood-guilt, but in human eyes His is a darker crime than that of Cain,— Rebellion against Social Wrong and Law!” Groaning, at length I slept, and in my dreams I saw The ruins of a Temple on a desolate plain. MY THEMES. To My Readers. (Freiligrath.) “Most weary man!—why wreathest thou Again and yet again,” methinks I hear you ask, “The turban on thy sunburnt brow? Wilt never vary Thy tristful task, But sing, still sing, of sands and seas as now, Housed in thy willow zumbul on the Dromedary? “Thy tent has now o'ermany times Been pitched in treeless places on old Ammon's plains! We long to greet in blander climes The Love and Laughter Thy soul disdains. Why wanderest ever thus in prolix rhymes Through snows and stony wastes, while we come toiling after? “Awake! Thou art as one who dreams; Thy quiver overflows with melancholy sand! Thou faintest in the noontide beams! Thy crystal beaker Of Song is banned! Filled with the juice of poppies from dull streams In sleepy Indian dells, it can but make thee weaker! “O! cast away the deadly draught, And glance around thee then with an awakened eye! The waters healthier bards have quaffed At Europe's Fountains Still babble by, Bright now as when the Grecian Summer laughed, And Poesy's first flowers bloomed on Apollo's mountains! “So many a voice thine era hath, And thou art deaf to all! O, study Mankind! Probe The heart! Lay bare its Love and Wrath, Its Joy and Sorrow! Not round the globe, O'er flood and field and dreary desert-path, But into thine own bosom look, and thence thy marvels borrow. “Weep! Let us hear thy tears resound From the dark iron concave of Life's Cup of Woe! Weep for the souls of Mankind, bound In chains of Error! Our tears will flow In sympathy with thine when thou hast wound Our feelings up to the proper pitch of Grief or Terror! “Unlock the life-gates of the flood That rushes through thy veins! Like Vultures we delight To glut our appetites with blood! Remorse, Fear, Torment, The blackening blight Love smites young hearts withal—these be the food For us! Without such stimulants our dull souls lie dormant! “But no long voyagings—oh, no more Of the weary East or South—no more of the Simoom— No apples from the Dead Sea shore— No fierce volcanoes, All fire and gloom! Or else, at most, sing basso, we implore, Of Orient sands, while Europe's flowers monopolise thy Sopranos!” Thanks, friends, for this your kind advice! Would I could follow it—could bide in balmier lands! But those far arctic tracts of ice, Those wildernesses Of wavy sands, Are the only home I have. They must suffice For one whose lonely hearth no smiling Peri blesses. Yet, count me not the more forlorn For my barbarian tastes. Pity me not. Oh, no! The heart laid waste by Grief or Scorn, Which inly knoweth Its own deep woe, Is the only Desert. There no spring is born Amid the sands—in that no shady Palm-tree groweth! ICHABOD! THY GLORY HAS DEPARTED. (Uhland.) I ride through a dark, dark Land by night, Where moon is none and no stars lend light, And rueful winds are blowing; Yet oft have I trodden this way ere now, With summer zephyrs a-fanning my brow, And the gold of the sunshine glowing. I roam by a gloomy garden wall; The death-stricken leaves around me fall; And the night-blast wails its dolours; How oft with my love I have hitherward strayed When the roses flowered, and all I surveyed Was radiant with Hope's own colours! But the gold of the sunshine is shed and gone And the once bright roses are dead and wan, And my love in her low grave moulders, And I ride through a dark, dark land by night With never a star to bless me with light, And the Mantle of Age on my shoulders. HOLINESS TO THE LORD. (Runge.) There blooms a beautiful Flower; it blooms in a far-off land; Its life has a mystic meaning, for few to understand. Its leaves illumine the valley, its odour scents the wood; And if evil men come near it they grow for the moment good. When the winds are tranced in slumber, the rays of this luminous Flower Shed glory more than earthly o'er lake, and hill, and bower; The hut, the hall, the palace, yea, Earth's forsakenest sod, Shine out in the wondrous lustre that fills the Heaven of God. Three kings came once to a hostel, wherein lay the Flower so rare: A star shone over its roof, and they knelt adoring there. Whenever thou seest a damsel, whose young eyes dazzle and win, O, pray that her heart may cherish this Flower of Flowers within! SONG. (Hölty.) O, strew the way with rosy flowers, And dupe with smiles thy grief and gloom, For tarnished wreaths and songless hours Await thee in the tomb. Lo! in the brilliant festal hall How lightly Youth and Beauty tread! Yet, gaze again—the grass is tall Above their charnel bed! In blaze of noon the jewelled bride Before the altar plights her faith: Ere weep the skies of eventide Her eyes are dulled in death! Then sigh no more—if life is brief So are its woes; and why repine? Pavilioned by the linden leaf We'll quaff the chaliced wine. Wild music from the nightingale Comes floating on the loaded breeze, To mingle in the bowery vale With hum of summer bees: Then taste the joys that God bestows, The beaded wine, the faithful kiss, For while the tide of Pleasure flows, Death bares his black abyss. In vain the Zephyr's breath perfumes The House of Death—in vain its tones Shall mourn at midnight round the tombs Where sleep our blackening bones. The star-bright bowl is broken there, The witchery of the lute is o'er, And—wreck of wrecks!—there lie the Fair, Whose beauty wins no more! A SONG FROM THE COPTIC. (Goethe.) Quarrels have long been in vogue among sages; Still, though in many things wranglers and rancorous, All the philosopher-scribes of all ages Join, una voce, on one point to anchor us. Here is the gist of their mystified pages, Here is the wisdom we purchase with gold— Children of Light, leave the world to its mulishness, Things to their natures, and fools to their foolishness; Berries were bitter in forests of old. Hoary old Merlin, that great necromancer, Made me, a student, a similar answer, When I besought him for light and for lore: Toiler in vain! leave the world to its mulishness, Things to their natures, and fools to their foolishness; Granite was hard in the quarries of yore. And on the ice-crested heights of Armenia, And in the valleys of broad Abyssinia, Still spake the Oracle just as before: Wouldst thou have peace, leave the world to its mulishness, Things to their natures and fools to their foolishness; Beetles were blind in the ages of yore. ANOTHER SONG FROM THE SAME COPTIC. (Goethe.) Go!—but heed and understand This my last and best command: Turn thine Youth to such advantage As that no reverse shall daunt Age. Learn the serpent's wisdom early; And contemn what Time destroys; Also, wouldst thou creep or climb, Chuse thy rôle, and chuse in time, Since the scales of Fortune rarely Show a liberal equipoise. Thou must either soar or stoop, Fall or triumph, stand or droop; Thou must either serve or govern, Must be slave, or must be sovereign, Must in fine, be block or wedge, Must be anvil or be sledge. SONG. (Tieck.) Yes, cherish Pleasure! To him alone 'Tis given to measure Time's jewelled zone. As over meadows Cloud-masses throng, So sweep the Shadows Of Earth along. The years are hasting To swift decay; Life's lamp is wasting By day and day. Yet cherish Pleasure! To him alone 'Tis given to measure Time's jewelled zone. For him the hours are Enamelled years; His laughing flowers are Undulled by tears. With him the starry And regal wine Best loves to tarry Where sun-rays shine. And when Night closes Around his sky, In graves of roses His Buried lie. Then cherish Pleasure! To him alone 'Tis given to measure Time's jewelled zone. LIGHT AND SHADOW. (Tieck.) The gayest lot beneath By Grief is shaded; Pale Evening sees the wreath Of Morning faded. Pain slays, or Pleasure cloys; All mortal morrows But waken hollow joys Or lasting sorrows. Hope yesternoon was bright, Earth beamed with Beauty; But soon came conquering Night, And claimed his booty. Life's billows as they roll Would fain look sunward; But ever must the soul Drift darkly onward. The sun forsakes the sky, Sad stars are sovereigns, Long shadows mount on high, And Darkness governs. So Love deserts his throne, Weary of reigning; Ah! would he but rule on Young and unwaning! Pain slays, or Pleasure cloys; And all our morrows But waken hollow joys Or lasting sorrows. LOVE AND LIGHT. (Tieck.) All who live of Loved and Beauteous, Sigh to Think how soon the trellised bowers Fade away with all their flowers, While the nightingales, unduteous, Also fly to Sing their soulful songs in far lands, And the wasted Summer dies, with all its odours, hues and garlands. Sooth to sing, it seems a dreamy Vision. Lavishly from silver fountains Fall diffused o'er lakes and mountains, Light and Life; when lo! the beamy Face elysian Of the heavens is darkened wholly, And the false enchantress flies, and leaves her dupes to melancholy. All that blooms but blooms to wither. Gladly Would the shrinking foliage flourish, Would the flowers their petals nourish In the beams that wander hither; But too sadly Sweepeth change; and Flora's garnish Scarcely pranks her infant minions ere, alas! they droop and tarnish. Love! and art thou fled, Consoler? Weary Feels my heart to see returning Sombre-vested months of mourning, While the spent year sinks with dolor, And so dreary Seem the woods I cannot haunt less, Even though bare of all their beauty, scentless, rayless, leafless, chauntless. LIFE IS THE DESERT AND THE SOLITUDE. Whence this fever? Whence this burning Love and Longing? Ah! forever, Ever turning, Ever thronging Tow'rds the Distance, Roams each fonder Yearning yonder, There, where wander Golden stars in blest existence! Thence what fragrant Airs are blowing! What rich vagrant Music flowing! Angel voices Tones wherein the Heart rejoices, Call from thence from Earth to win thee! How yearns and burns for evermore My heart for thee, thou blessèd shore! And shall I never see thy fairy Bowers and palace-gardens near? Will no enchanted skiff so airy, Sail from thee to seek me here? O! undeveloped Land, Whereto I fain would flee, What mighty hand shall break each band That keeps my soul from thee? In vain I pine and sigh To trace thy dells and streams: They gleam but by the spectral sky That lights my shifting dreams. Ah! what fair form, flitting through yon green glades, Dazes mine eye? Spirit, oh! rive my chain! Woe is my soul! Swiftly the vision fades, And I start up—waking—to weep in vain! Hence this fever; Hence this burning Love and Longing: Hence forever, Ever turning, Ever thronging, Tow'rds the Distance, Roams each fonder Yearning yonder, There, where wander Golden stars in blest existence! BE MERRY AND WISE. (Kotzebue.) No beauty, no glory remaineth Below the unbribable skies; All beauty but winneth and waneth— All glory but dazzles and dies. Since multitudes cast in a gay mould Before us have lived and have laughed— To the slumberers under the claymould Let goblet on goblet be quaffed! For millions in centuries after Decay shall have crumbled our bones, As lightly with revel and laughter Will fill their progenitors' thrones. Here banded together in union Our bosoms are joyous and gay, How blest, could our festive communion Remain to enchant us for aye! But Change is omnipotent ever; Thus knitted we cannot remain; Wide waves and high hills will soon sever The links of our brotherly chain. Yet even though far disunited Our hearts are in fellowship still, And all, if but one be delighted, Will hear it with sympathy's thrill. And if, after years have gone o'er us, Fate brings us together once more, Who knows but the mirth of our chorus May yet be as loud as before! THE SAW-MILL. (From the German.) My path lay towards the Mourne again, But I stopped to rest by the hillside That glanced adown o'er the sunken glen, Where the Saw- and Water-mills hide, Which now, as then, The Saw- and Water-mills hide. And there, as I lay reclined on the hill, Like a man made by sudden qualm ill, I heard the water in the Water-mill, And I saw the saw in the Saw-mill! As I thus lay still, I saw the saw in the Saw-mill! The saw, the breeze, and the humming bees, Lulled me into a dreamy reverie, Till the objects round me, hills, mills, trees, Seemed grown alive all and every, By slow degrees Took life as it were, all and every! Anon the sound of the waters grew To a very Mourne-ful ditty, And the song of the tree that the saw sawed through, Disturbed my spirit with pity, Began to subdue My spirit with tenderest pity! “O, wand'rer! the hour that brings thee back Is of all meet hours the meetest. Thou now, in sooth, art on the Track, Art nigher to Home than thou weetest; Thou hast thought Time slack, But his flight has been of the fleetest! “For thee it is that I dree such pain As, when wounded, even a plank will; My bosom is pierced, is rent in twain, That thine may ever bide tranquil, May ever remain Henceforward untroubled and tranquil. “In a few days more, most Lonely One! Shall I, as a narrow ark, veil Thine eyes from the glare of the world and sun 'Mong the urns in yonder dark vale, In the cold and dun Recesses of yonder dark vale! “For this grieve not! Thou knowest what thanks The Weary-souled and Meek owe To Death!”—I awoke, and heard four planks Fall down with a saddening echo. I heard four planks Fall down with a hollow echo. CHILDHOOD. (Salis.) And where is now the golden hour When Earth was as a fairy realm, When Fancy revelled Within her own enchanted bower, Which Sorrow came to overwhelm, Which Reason levelled; When Life was new and Hope was young, And sought and saw no other chart Than rose where'er We turned—the crystal joy that sprung Up from the ever-bubbling heart? O! tell us where! Man, like the leaf that swims the wave, A wanderer down that rushing river Whose torchless shore Is spectre-peopled from the grave, Can scarce, amid his whirl and fever Of soul, explore The treasures infant-bosoms cherish; Yet feelings of celestial birth To these are given, Whose Iris hues, too deep to perish, Surviving Life, outlasting Earth, Shall glow in Heaven. I see thy willow-darkened stream, Thy sunny lake, thy sunless grove, Before me glassed In many a dimly-gorgeous dream, And wake to love, to doubly love The magic Past! Or Fiction lifts her dazzling wand, And lo! her buried wonders rise On Slumber's view, Till all Arabia's genii-land Shines out, the mimic Paradise Thy pencil drew! Youth burns: we run the blind career Which they who run but run to rue; Too fleetly flies The witchery of that maddening year; Yet will we not the track pursue Where Wisdom lies, For Manhood lours, and all the cares And toils and ills of Manhood born Consume the soul, Till withered Age's whitened hairs, The symbols of his Winter, warn Us to the goal. But thou, lost vision! Memory clings To all of bright and pure and fond By thee enrolled! Mementos as of times and things Antique, remote, far, far beyond The Flood of old! Yet oh! the spell itself how brief! How sadly brief! how swiftly broken! We witness how The freshness of the lily's leaf Ere Autumn dies, and leaves no token— And where art thou? THE GRAVE. (Mahlmann.) Blest are the dormant In death: they repose From bondage and torment, From passions and woes, From the yoke of the world and the snares of the traitor— The grave, the grave is the true liberator! Griefs chase one another Around the earth's dome; In the arms of the mother Alone is our home. Woo pleasure, ye triflers! The thoughtful are wiser; The grave, the grave is their one tranquilliser! Is the good man unfriended On life's ocean path, When storms have expended Their turbulent wrath? Are his labours requited by slander and rancour? The grave, the grave is his sure bower-anchor! To gaze on the faces Of lost ones anew, To lock in embraces The loved and the true, Were a rapture to make even Paradise brighter. The grave, the grave is the great re-uniter! Crown the corpse, then, with laurels, The conqueror's wreath, Make joyous with carols The chamber of death, And welcome the victor with cymbal and psalter: The grave, the grave is the only exalter! MY THREE TORMENTORS. (Song of a Maniac.) Three spirits there be who haunt me always, Plaguing my spirit in sundry small ways. One is apparelled in purple and red; He sits on a barrel—a chaplet of laurel Which ought to be mine, and was before he Robbed me of brains, and bread, and glory, Wreathèd around his globular head, And a royal and richly bubbling cup Of the blood that he drains from his victims' veins In his hand, that shakes as he lifts it up! Oh, woe, woe, And sorrow, To me, to be His slave, Through every coming morrow, Till years lay me low, Low in an honourless grave! My second tormentor, a weazened old pigmy, Delves in a mine, as though he would dig my Grave, or his own—I'd hardly care which! His visage is wrinkled and dust-besprinkled, His clothes are in rags, yet he heaps together Bright gold by the bushel; one scarce knows whether The hateful old hunks be poor or be rich! His gold is ever before his view; He worships it, he, and alas! makes me In spite of my conscience, worship it too! Oh, woe, woe, And sorrow, To me, to be His slave, Through every coming morrow, Till years lay me low, Low in an honourless grave! The third—oh! the third is a marvellous creature, Infant-like, and of heavenly feature! His voice is rich as the song of the spheres; But ah! what tragic unrest its magic Doth bring to the bosom who shall tell of? To me that voice has been as the knell of Death and Despair through bitterest years! And then, his bright but mischievous eyes! Their mildest glance is the wound of a lance, 'Neath which the heart's blank innocence dies! Oh, woe, woe, And sorrow, To me, to be A slave To these through every morrow, Till years lay me low, Low in mine honourless grave! O MARIA, REGINA MISERICORDIÆ! (Karl Simrock.) There lived a Knight long years ago, Proud, carnal, vain, devotionless. Of God above, or Hell below, He took no thought, but undismayed Pursued his course of wickedness. His heart was rock; he never prayed To be forgiven for all his treasons; He only said at certain seasons, “O Mary, Queen of Mercy!” Years rolled, and found him still the same, Still draining Pleasure's poison-bowl; Yet felt he now and then some shame; The torment of the Undying Worm At whiles woke in his trembling soul; And then, though powerless to reform, Would he, in hope to appease that sternest Avenger, cry, and more in earnest, “O Mary, Queen of Mercy!” At last Youth's riotous time was gone, And Loathing now came after Sin. With locks yet brown, he felt as one Grown grey at heart; and oft with tears, He tried, but all in vain, to win From the dark desert of his years One flower of hope; yet morn and e'ening, He still cried, but with deeper meaning, “O Mary, Queen of Mercy!” A happier mind, a holier mood, A purer spirit, ruled him now: No more in thrall to flesh and blood, He took a pilgrim staff in hand, And under a religious vow, Travailed his way to Pommerland. There entered he an humble cloister, Exclaiming, while his eyes grew moister, “O Mary, Queen of Mercy!” Here, shorn and cowled, he laid his cares Aside, and wrought for God alone. Albeit, he sang no choral prayers, Nor matin hymn nor laud could learn, He mortified his flesh to stone; For him no penance was too stern; And often prayed he on his lonely Cell couch at night, but still said only, “O Mary, Queen of Mercy!” And thus he lived, long, long; and, when God's angels called him, thus he died. Confession made he none to men, Yet when they anointed him with oil, He seemed already glorified. His penances, his tears, his toil Were past; and now with passionate sighing, Praise thus broke from his lips while dying, “O Mary, Queen of Mercy!” They buried him with mass and song Aneath a little knoll so green: But, lo! a wonder sight!—Ere long Rose blooming from that verdant mound, The fairest lily ever seen; And on its petal-edges round, Relieving their translucent whiteness, Did shine these words in gold-hued brightness, “O Mary, Queen of Mercy!” And would God's angels give thee power, Thou, dearest reader, might'st behold The fibres of this holy flower, Upspringing from the dead man's heart In tremulous threads of light and gold: Then wouldst thou choose the better part! And thenceforth flee Sin's foul suggestions; Thy sole response to mocking questions, “O Mary, Queen of Mercy!” THE LOVER'S FAREWELL. (Kerner.) Slowly through the tomb-still streets I go— Morn is dark, save one swart streak of gold— Sullen rolls the far-off river's flow, And the moon is very thin and cold. Long and long before the house I stand Where sleeps she, the dear, dear one I love— All undreaming that I leave my land, Mute and mourning, like the moon above! Wishfully I stretch abroad mine arms Towards the well-remembered casement-cell— Fare thee well! Farewell thy virgin charms! And thou stilly, stilly house, farewell! And farewell the dear dusk little room, Redolent of roses as a dell, And the lattice that relieved its gloom— And its pictured lilac walls, farewell! Forth upon my path! I must not wait— Bitter blows the fretful morning wind: Warden, wilt thou softly close the gate When thou knowest I leave my heart behind? TO THE SPIRIT-SEERESS OF PREVORST. As She Lay on Her Death-bed (Kerner.) Yet lingerest thou!—but I have ceased repining; Through thy long nights I see God's brightness shining; For, though our Sceneworld vanish from thy sight, Within thee radiates more than starry light! To thee have been revealed—bared for thy seeing— The Inner Life—the Mystery of Being— Heaven, Hades, Hell—the eternal How and Where— The glory of the Dead—and their despair! Tears darkened long thy bodily vision nightly, Yet then, even then, the Interior Eye saw brightly, Saw, too, how Truth itself spake by His voice Who bade men weep, that so they might rejoice! Well hast thou borne thy Cross, like Him, thy Master, Though griefs, like snares, waylaid thee fast and faster. While that hard-minded world which knew thee not Found only food for mockery in thy lot! And now, rejoice, thou Faithfullest and Meekest! It lies in sight, the Quiet Home thou seekest; And gently wilt thou pass to it, for thou Art all but disembodied even now! TO THE GHOST-SEERESS OF PREVORST, AFTER HER DECEASE. (Kerner.) Farewell!—the all I owe to thee This breast enshrined shall ever keep; Mine Inner Sense upwakes to see The Ghostworld's clear and wondrous Deep. Where'er thy home—in Light or Shade— A spirit still thou wert and art; Oh! if my faith shall fail or fade, Send thou a sign to cheer my heart! And, since thou soon shalt share the power Of purer spirits, blessèd, bright, Sustain me in that fateful hour When Death shall rob mine eyes of light! Above the grave-mound blooms and blows Of all dear flowers the dearest one, Mute witness of the Saviour's woes, Thine own beloved Hypericon. And that lone flower, blood-hued at heart, And gold without, from every leaf Shall nightly to my soul impart The memory of thy faith and grief. Farewell!—the world may mock, may rave; Me little move its words or ways; Men's idle scorn he well can brave Who never wooed their idler praise. MY ADIEU TO THE MUSE. (Kerner.) 1830.Winter is nearing my dark threshold fast, Already in low knells and broken wailings, Ever austerer, menaces the blast Which, soon a tempest, with its fierce assailings Will swoop down on its unresistant prey. The Iris-coloured firmament, whereto Imagination turned, weeps day by day, For some lost fragment of its gold and blue, And the dun clouds are mustering thick that soon Will overdark the little of the beams Of that unfaithful and most wasted Moon Of hope, that yet with pallid face (as gleams A dying lamp amid grey ruins), wins The cozened spirit o'er its flowerless path. So be it! When the wanderer's night begins, And the hoarse winds are heard afar in wrath, He gazes on the curtained West with tears, And lists disturbedly each sound, nor sees Aught but dismay in the vague Night, nor hears Aught but funereal voices on the breeze, But when—his hour of gloom and slumber done— He looks forth on the re-awakened globe, Freshly apparelled in her virgin robe Of morning light and crownèd with the sun, His heart bounds like the light roe from its lair. And shall it not be thus with me—the trance Of death once conquered and o'erpast?—Perchance I know not, but I cannot all despair. I have grieved enough to bid Man's world farewell Without one pang—and let not this be turned To my disparagement what time my unurned Ashes lie trodden in the churchyard dell. For is not Grief the deepest, purest love? Were not the tears that I have wept alone Beside the midnight river, in the grove, Under the yew, or o'er the burial-stone, The outpourings of a heart that overflowed With an affection worlds beyond control, The pleasurable anguish of a soul That, while it suffered, fondly loved and glowed? It may be that my love was foolishness, And yet it was not wholly objectless In mine own fancy, which in soulless things, Fountains and wildwood blossoms, rills and bowers, Read words of mystic lore, and found in flowers, And birds, and clouds, and winds, and gushing springs, Histories from ancient spheres like the dim wanderers Whose path is in the great Inane of Blue, And which, though voiceless, utter to the few Of Earth, whom Heaven and Poesy make ponderers Apocalyptic oracles and true. My Fatherland! My Mother-Earth! I owe Ye much, and would not seem ungrateful now; And if the laurel decorate my brow, Be that a set-off against so much woe As Man's applause hath power to mitigate; If I have won, but may not wear it yet, The wreath is but unculled, and soon or late Will constitute my vernal coronet, Fadeless—at least till some unlooked-for blight fall— For, thanks to Knowledge, fair Desert, though sometimes Repulsed and baffled, wins its meed at last, And the reveil-call which on Fame's deep drum Time's Hands beat for some lost hero of the Past, If mute at morn and noon, will sound ere nightfall, Hard though the struggle oft be which is made, Not against Power throned in its proud pavilions, Not against Wealth in trumpery sheen arrayed, But against those who speed as the Postillions Of Mind before the world, and, in their grade Of teachers, can exalt or prostrate millions. I have said I would not be an ingrate—No! 'Twere unavailing now to examine whence The tide of my calamities may flow— Enough that in my heart its residence Is permanent and bitter:—let me not Perhaps rebelliously arraign my lot. If I have looked for nobleness and truth, In souls where Treachery's brood of scorpions dwelt, And felt the awakening shock as few have felt, And found, alas! no anodyne to soothe, I murmur not; to me was overdealt, No doubt, the strong and wrong romance of Youth. Less blame I for each lacerating error, For all the javelin memories that pierce Me now, that world wherein I willed to mirror The visions of my boyhood, than the fierce Impulses of a breast that scarce would curb One ardent feeling, even when all was gone Which makes Life dear, and ever frowned upon Such monitors as ventured to disturb Its baleful happiness. Of this no more. My benison be on my native hills! And when the sun shall shine upon the tomb Where I and the remembrance of mine ills Alike shall slumber, may his beams illume Scenes happy as they oft illumed before, Scenes happier than these feet have ever trod! May the green Earth glow in the smile of God! May the unwearying stars as mildly twinkle As now—the rose and jessamine exhale Their frankincense—the moon be still as pale— The pebbled rivulets as lightly tinkle— The singing-birds in Summer fill the vale With lays whose diapasons never cloy! May Love still garland his young votaries' brows! May the fond husband and his faithful spouse List to the pleasant nightingale with joy! May radiant Hope for the soft souls that dream Of golden hours long, long continue brightening An alas! traitorous Future with her beam, When in forgotten dust my bones lie whitening! And, for myself, all I would care to claim Is kindness to my memory—and to those Whom I have tried, and trusted to the close, Would I speak thus: Let Truth but give to Fame My virtues with my failings; if this be, Not all may weep but none will blush for me; And—whatsoever chronicle of Good, Attempted or achieved, may stand to speak For what I was, when kindred souls shall seek To unveil a life but darkly understood,— Men will not, cannot, write it on my grave That I, like myriads, was a mindless clod, And trod with fettered will the course they trod, Crouched to a world whose habitudes deprave And sink the loftiest nature to a slave, Slunk from my standard and renounced my God. They will not, cannot tell, when I am cold, That I betrayed, even once, a plighted trust, Wrote but a single vow in Summer dust, Or, weakly blinded by the glitter, sold The best affections of my heart for gold, And died as fickle as the wind or wave; No! they will not write this upon my grave. HOME-SICKNESS. (Justinus Kerner.) There calleth me ever a marvellous Horn, “Come away! Come away!” Is it earthly music faring astray, Or is it air-born? Oh, whether it be a spirit-wile Or a forest-voice, It biddeth mine ailing heart rejoice, Yet sorrow the while! In the greenwood glades—o'er the garlanded bowl— Night, Noontide and Morn, The summoning call of that marvellous Horn Tones home to my soul! In vain have I sought for it east and west, But I darkly feel That so soon as its music shall cease to peal I go to my rest! MY HOME. (Wetzel.) Morn and eve a star invites me, One imploring, silver star, Woos me, calls me, lures me, lights me, O'er the desert deep afar To a lovely Orient land, Where the sun at morning early Rises fresh and young and glowing, Where the air is light and bland, And the rain-drops fall so pearly. Therefore am I going, going Home to this, my lovely land, Where the sun at morning early Rises fresh and young and glowing, Where the airs are light and bland, And the rain is warm and pearly! All unheeding, all unknowing, I am speeding, I am going— Going home to my—to my land, To my only lonely island In the desert deep afar. Yet, unknowing and undreaming, Why I go, or how, or whither, Save that one imploring star, Ever burning, ever beaming, Woos me, lures me, lights me thither! WHEN THE ROSES BLOW. (Wetzel.) When the roses blow Man looks out for brighter hours; When the roses glow Hope relights her lampless bowers. Much that seemed in Winter's gloom Dark with heavy woe Wears a gladsome hue and bloom When the roses blow— When the roses blow— Wears a gladsome hue and bloom When the roses blow. When the roses blow Love that slept shall wake anew: Merrier blood shall flow Through the springalds' veins of blue: And if sorrow wring the heart, Even that shall go— Pain and mourning must depart When the roses blow— When the roses blow— Pain and mourning must depart When the roses blow. When the roses blow Look to Heaven, my fainting soul! There in stainless show Spreads the veil that shrouds thy goal. Not while Winter breathes his blight, Burst thy bonds below! Let the earth look proud and bright! Let the roses blow! Let the roses blow! O, let Earth look proud and bright! Let the roses blow!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART VI MISCELLANEOUS VERSIONS LIFE, DEATH, ETERNITY. (From the Castilian.) Arise, my soul! awake! arise! Shake off thine idle earthly dreams, And think how soon The longest human lifetime flies— How soon the Hand which gave, redeems Its mystic boon!— How swiftly Pleasure's gorgeous cheats And Power's colossal pomps and lures Are lost in gloom, Till even their faintest memory fleets, And Man first finds that nought endures But God and Doom! Time summons, and our nights and days, With all their hollow hopes and joys, Their tears and mirth, Go home by dark and trackless ways, And join the years that rolled ere Troy's Renown had birth. Forth flow the moments, dusk or bright, And, as their unresounding stream Departs away, With each successive wavelet's flight Some fragment of Life's glittering dream Grows dim for aye! Like silent rivers hurrying on Through storm and calm, through ebb and flow, To Ocean's breast, Illusions leave us one by one, Long ere the heart itself lies low In dreamless rest. Youth, Pleasure, Glory, Genius, Love, Burn bright awhile, then wane and die, Like those long trains Of meteor lights that flash above, And starless blackness, as on high, Alone remains! This world is but a thoroughfare, A road by which we all must go To reach our Home; Some dance along, some droop in care, But All wend on, both high and low, Both sage and mome. Our pilgrimage begins in tears, And sorrows throng our thorny way Even from our birth, Till, having reached the Vale of Years, We bow to Death, who blends our clay With that of Earth. Yet this vain world, which so controls And fills the hearts of Adam's race, If used aright Might serve to sanctify our souls, And prove a fruitful means of Grace, And source of Might. As boundless love to wretched Man Brought down the Son of God from Heaven, Winged by that love Our souls might spurn Life's prisoning span, And, purified from earthly leaven, Ascend above. The bright cerulean Gothic blood, The royal names, the lords of old, Are gone and past; So all that breathe of Base and Good, Of Strong and Frail, of Mean and Bold, Sink, too, at last. Some fall by Craft, more yield to Strength, Disease, Want, War, and broken hearts Sweep off the mass, But All meet in that House at length, To which, despite of arms and arts, Even kings must pass. The social joys, the hallowed loves, That gird Life's twilight pathway round, Are cloister walls. Woe then to him who madly roves Beyond!—he treads forbidden ground, Where Virtue falls! And oh! if even the Just would flee That last dread hour for human dust Too oft forgot, What must the sinner's death-bed be? Yet, saints or sinners, die we must, Absolved or not. O, Man, thou self-deluder! canst Thou dupe thy soul in Youth with hope Of golden years? Alas! ere more than half advanced On Life's rough road, thou hast to grope Thy way in tears! A faint light glimmers now and then Through Manhood's hour perchance, to cheer Thy pilgrimage, But Darkness clouds the scene agen, And tenfold night anon draws near In palsied Age! How shalt thou, then, find best escape From all the ills that so beset Life's drear exile? Gold, Glory, even the tempting grape, At most but aid thee to forget Thy state awhile— Where, when the warring world's alarms Ring loud around thee, shalt thou find True peace of soul? Oh, where, but in Religion's arms? Where, but with Faith, which wings the mind To Heaven, its goal? For me, no formal tome I cite, No grave, elaborate moralist, No poet-lays. For he who turns to such for light Meets but at best a dazzling mist That mocks his gaze. I raise my thoughts in prayer to God, I look for help to Him alone Who shared our lot, The Mighty One of Heaven, who trod Life's path as Man, though Earth, His own, Received Him not! I turn to Him, and ask for nought Save knowledge of His heavenly will, Whate'er it be: I seek no doubtful blessings, fraught With present good, but final ill And agony. Come Death or Life, come Woe or Weal, Whate'er my God elects to send I here embrace; Blest while, though tortured on the wheel, I forfeit not, or worse, misspend His holy grace. THE MARINER'S BRIDE. (From the Spanish.) Look, Mother! the Mariner's rowing His galley a-down the tide; I'll go where the mariner's going, And be the mariner's bride! I saw him one day through the wicket, I opened the gate and we met— As a bird in the fowler's net Was I caught in my own green thicket. O mother, my tears are flowing, I've lost my maidenly pride— I'll go if the mariner's going, And be the mariner's bride! This Love the tyrant evinces, Alas! an omnipotent might, He darkens the mind like night, He treads on the necks of Princes! O mother, my bosom is glowing, I'll go whatever betide; I'll go where the mariner's going, And be the mariner's bride! Yes! mother, the spoiler has reft me Of reason and self-control; Gone, gone is my wretched soul, And only my body is left me! The winds, O mother, are blowing, The ocean is bright and wide; I'll go where the mariner's going; And be the mariner's bride. THE MASS OF THE BIRDS. (From the Welsh of Davyth Ap Gwylynn, an Anglesea Bard of the Fourteenth Century.) This morning, lying couched amid the grass In the deep deep dingle south of Llangwyth's Pass, While it was yet neither quite bright nor dark, I heard a new and wonderful High Mass. The Chief Priest was the nightingale: the Lark And Thrush assisted him; and some small bird (I do not weet his name) acted as Clerk. My spirit was lapt in ecstasy: each word, Word after word, thrilled through me like the deep Rich music of a dream: not wholly asleep Nor all awake was I, but, as it were, Tranced somewhere between one state and the other. All heavy thoughts that through the long day smother Man's heart and soul with weariness and care Were gone, and in their place reigned pure delight. The nightingale, sent from a far and bright Land by my golden sister, prophesied Of blessèd days to come, in a sweet voice; And the small Bird responding, sang, “Rejoice! Rejoice!” I heard his little bell tinkle and jingle With a clear silver sound that filled the dingle. Heaven is a state wherein Bliss and Devotion mingle, And such was mine this morn: I could have died Of rapture! Never knelt upon his hassock Bishop or deacon with a holier feeling. How beautifully shone the Thrush's cassock, Covered all over with a thousand strange And lovely flowers, like those upon an Arabesque ceiling! The altar seemed of such resplendent gold As no man, even a miser, would exchange For all the jewels in the East of old. Two hours I lay admiring all I saw, Yet those two hours appeared to me no more Than as a moment: I look back with awe And wonder at what then I thought and felt, And would give all my fame, and all my lore, Yea, even almost my life, but to restore The rapturous emotions that then dwelt Within my bosom! Ah! this may not be— But glory unto God, who in His infinite love Created Man to enjoy to eternity Even greater happiness in His own Heaven above!</field>

That's it! Come, Jean, put on his fetters! A FAST KEEPER. My friend, Tom Bentley, borrowed from me lately A score of yellow shiners. Subsequently I met the cove, and dunned him rather gently; Immediately he stood extremely stately, And swore, 'pon honour, that he wondered greatly. We parted coolly. Well! (exclaimed I ment'lly) I calculate this isn't acting straightly; You're what slangwhangers call a scamp, Tom Bentley. In sooth, I thought his impudence prodigious, And so I told Jack Spratt a few days after; But Jack burst into such a fit of laughter. “Fact is,” said he, “poor Tom has turned religious.” I stared, and asked him what he meant— “Why, don't you see,” quoth Jack, “he keeps the Lent.” A THOUGHT. Though Laughter seems, it never is, the antithesis to Tears; The gayest births of Circumstance or Fancy But minister in masquerade to Sovereign Grief, who rears Her temple by that moral necromancy Which fuses down to one dark mass all passions of Life's years; And, as from even adverse facts Vallancey Proved us mere Irish to be Orientals, Nature makes Grinning Schools turn men out Sentimentals. THE WAYFARING TREE. We Old bachelor bards, having none to mind us, Are seized at seasons with such a heart-aching That, leaving home and its wants behind us, We hie elsewhither, the spirit's car taking Us east and west, and aloft and nether, And thus I, also, both night and day faring From Hartz to Hellas, pass weeks together (In vision) under mine old Wayfaring Tree, My childhood's dearly belovèd Wayfaring Tree! Free Of pinion then, like the lonely pewit, I watch through Autumn its golden leaves dropping, And list the sighs of the winds that woo it— A somewhat silly but sinless eavesdropping!— And sadly ponder those rosy dream-hours When Boyhood's fancies went first a-May-Fairing. Ah! we may smile, but the joys that seem ours Soon leave us mourners beneath our Wayfaring Tree, Insolvent mourners beneath our Wayfaring Tree! Me No Muse amuses or flatters longer, No couplet cozens, no trashy trope bubbles, Yet, though my judgment grows daily stronger, I love this blowing of psychic soap-bubbles. The soul tends always in one direction, Its course is homeward: and, like a fay faring Through airy space, even each deflection But brings it nearer its destined Wayfaring Tree. Its way is short to its final Wayfaring Tree. See, Oh, see to your ways then, my mad young masters, Blind pleasure-chasers and headstrong high-fliers, Nor tempt your fate for those dark disasters Which make, alas! the best hopes of Life liars. And you, ye grubbers of dirt and dollars, Whose dungeoned hearts fear a fresh and safe airing, Think how Experience plants all her scholars Alone at last under Age's Wayfaring Tree! Alone at Night under Age's Wayfaring Tree! TO BAKKI. O Bakki, Bakki! Necromancer! Sun and Soul of Poetry! What bosom not of granite but is melted at thy song? Even as the Storm with equal ease will waft a leaf or blow a tree From North to South, thy spell can move the weak heart and the strong. I know of nothing vast enough to liken thy bold verses to, Except Iskander's mighty hosts, and those of Artaxerxes too, Or some enormous river, spouting now colossal columns, Now thundering over jaggèd rocks, now holding a calm course Between two banks of golden sands (the margins of thy volumes), But everywhere and ever the same Giant in its force. O Bakki, Bakki! in my days of joy and juvenility, Armed with my silver-bowled tchibook and all I had of thee, My glory was to revel in the wonderful fertility Of thy luxuriant genius underneath a citron-tree: But now that years have conquered me, and sicknesses have shaken me, And Fancy hath forsaken me, and Age hath overtaken me, I find some stiffer harness indispensable for yoking My spirit to the Plough of Life—in short I must resign My silver bowls for china cups, my Poetry and Smoking, My snaky pipes and bakki-leaves for fiery Madjar wine. GENUINE ETHEREALITY. (From the Ottoman.) Mine eyes, of old the beamiest of the beamy, Are now, alas! the filmiest of the filmy: So meagre am I, too, no lath is like me; Death, for my shadowy thinness, cannot see me, And when he enters my sad cell to kill me, His lance will not know how or when to strike me! THE DYING FATHER. (From the German.) A father had two children, Will and Christy— The last a bright young lad, the first a dull humdrum. One day, perceiving that his hour was come, Stretched on the bed of death he glanced with misty Eye around the room in search of Christy— “My son,” he said, “sad thoughts begin to darken My mind. You are a genius. What a task it Will be for you to face the world! But hearken! Inside my desk there lies a little casket Of jewels. Take them all, my son, And lock them up, and give your brother none.” The youth was wonder-struck. He thought this droll, And looking in his father's face, he said— “But, bless me, father! if I take the whole, What is poor Will to do? I greatly dread—” “Dread nothing, Christy,” interrupted t'other; “There's not the slightest ground for this timidity; I'll warrant you your booby of a brother Will make his way through life by sheer stupidity!” WHERE'S MY MONEY? (Franz Gaudy.) Ay! where's my money? That's a puzzling query. It vanishes. Yet neither in my purse Nor pocket are there any holes. 'Tis very Incomprehensible. I don't disburse For superfluities. I wear plain clothes. I seldom buy jam tarts, preserves, or honey; And no one overlooks what debts he owes More steadily than I. Where is my money? I never tipple. Folks don't see me staggering, Sans cane and castor, in the public street. I sport no ornaments—not even a bague (ring). I have a notion that my own two feet Are much superior to a horse's four, So never call a jarvey. It is funny. The longer I investigate, the more Astoundedly I ask, Where is my money? My money, mind you! Other people's dollars Cohere together nobly. Only mine Cut one another. There's that pink of scholars Von Doppeldronk, he spends as much on wine As I on—every thing. Yet he seems rich, He laughs, and waxes plumper than a bunny, While I grow slim as a divining-switch, And search for gold as vainly. Where's my money? I can't complain that editors don't pay me; I get for every sheet One Pound Sixteen; And well I may! My articles are flamy Enough to blow up any Magazine. What's queerest in the affair though is, that at The same time I miss nothing but the one. He That watches me will find I don't lose hat, Gloves, fogle, stick, or cloak. 'Tis always money! Were I a rake I'd say so. Where one roysters Beyond the rules, of course his cash must go. 'Tis true I regularly sup on oysters, Cheese, brandy, and all that. But even so? What signifies a ducat of a night? “The barmaids,” you may fancy. No. The sunny Loadstar that draws my tin is not the light From their eyes anyhow. Where then's my money? However, àpropos of eyes and maidens, I own I do make presents to the Sex— Books, watches, trinkets, music, too (not Haydn's), Combs, shawls, veils, bonnets—things that might perplex A man to count. But still I gain by what I lose in this way. 'Tis experience won—eh? I think so. My acquaintances think not. No matter. I grow tedious. Where's my money? THE METEMPSYCHOSIS. (Castelli.) I've studied sundry treatises by spectacled old sages Anent the capabilities and nature of the soul, and Its vagabond propensities from even the earliest ages, As harped on by Spinosa, Plato, Leibnitz, Chubb and Toland; But of all systems I've yet met, or p'rhaps shall ever meet with, Not one can hold a candle to (videlicet, compete with) The theory of theories Pythagoras proposes, And called by that profound old snudge (in Greek) Metempsychosis. It seems to me a pos'tive truth, admitting of no modi- Fication, that the human soul, accustomed to a lodging Inside a carnal tenement, must, when it quits one body, Instead of sailing to and fro, and profitlessly dodging About from post to pillar without either pause or purpose, Seek out a habitation in some other cozy corpus, And when, by luck, it pops on one with which its habits match, box Itself therein instanter, like a sentry in a watch-box. This may be snapped at, sneered at, sneezed at. Deuce may care for cavils. Reason is reason. Credit me, I've met at least one myriad Of instances to prop me up. I've seen (upon my travels) Foxes who had been lawyers at (no doubt) some former period. Innumerable apes, who, though they'd lost their patronymics, I recognised immediately as mountebanks and mimics, And asses, calves, etcet'ra, whose rough bodies gave asylum To certain souls, the property of learn'd professors whilome. To go on with my catalogue: what will you bet I've seen a Goose, that was reckoned in her day a pretty-faced young woman? But more than that, I knew at once a bloody-lipped hyena To've been a Russian Marshal, or an ancient Emperor (Roman) All snakes and vipers, toads and reptiles, crocodiles and crawlers I set down as court sycophants or hypocritic bawlers, And there I may've been right or wrong—but nothing can be truer Than this, that in a scorpion I beheld a vile reviewer. So far we've had no stumbling-block. But now a puzzling question Arises: all the afore-named souls were souls of stunted stature, Contemptible or cubbish—but Pythag. has no suggestion Concerning whither transmigrate souls noble in their nature, As Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Schiller—these now, for example, What temple can be found for such appropriately ample? Where lodge they now? Not, certes, in our present ninnyhammers, Who mumble rhymes that seem to've been concocted by their Gammers. Well, then, you see, it comes to this—and after huge reflection Here's what I say: A soul that gains, by many transmigrations, The summit, apex, pinnacle, or acmé of perfection, There ends, concludes and terminates its earthly per'grinations. Then, like an air-balloon, it mounts through high Olympus' portals, And cuts its old connections with Mortality and mortals; And evidence to back me here I don't know any stronger Than that the truly Great and Good are found on Earth no longer. THE KING OF THE FRANKS. All night and day lie the gates unbarred, The King of the Franks gives a dinner and ball; The henchmen and vassals bask in the yard, The knights and the nobles dine in the hall. The lamps shed a light Indescribably bright From the arabesque roof to the floor of the palace, And, to-and-fro wending, go menials, attending The gobblers and bibbers with platter and chalice. Gay dancing follows the dinner and wine— His Majesty's daughter, an awful beauty, Has waltzed with a Duke from the banks of the Rhine, And she leans on the arm he proffers in duty. So courtly is she, So portly is he, That they gaze on each other astounded together, And now the Grand Duke leads the lass to a nook Where they talk in low tones on the broiling hot weather. Sir Hildebrand foots it with maid and dame, Now this, now that, as a partner he takes; And all who inspect him, charmed, exclaim— “The darling! Such nice pirouettes as he makes!” Said the King, “By the powers But this long Pole of ours Takes the rag off the bush as the pink of a Ritter!” But the Nymph of the Nook never deigns him a look And praise from all others is barren or bitter. At last she sails out, and he begs the favour Of whirling in turn with the fairest of all; 'Tis granted, and he and his dear enslaver Exhibit their paces and shapes through the hall. So grand and so soft Mounts the music aloft That anon the brain of Sir Hildebrand reels, And he dares to begin a confession to Minna, In catalogue form, of the pangs that he feels. But woe is my soul for your triste young lispers Of love into ears that disdain to listen! Despite of his glances, his groaning whispers, His eyes that half tearfully wink and glisten, And gesture emphatic, Her looks grow erratic And turn from her suitor with ill-suppressed loathing To where the Grand Duke, boxed up in his nook, Sits plunged in profound meditation on nothing. That one brief glance, full of love for another, Sped daggers and death to the heart of the Pole; In vain his philosophy strove to smother The serpents that jealousy bred in his soul; As backward he staggered, With countenance haggard, And feelings as acid as beer after thunder, 'Twas plain that the dart that had entered his heart Was rending his physical system asunder. THE DEVIL AND THE WIND. (From the Rheinsagen.) A LEGEND. I Before the Jesuits' House at Bonn the Wind pipes high and shrill, It pipes all day, it wails all night—'tis never, never still: It shrieketh like a woman who hath not—or hath—her will. II And why thus pipes, and why thus wails it, wails it night and day? The cause is told in many an old and wizard monkish lay. For ancient is that holy House, now falling to decay. III The Devil, sadly tired of Hell, went once a-pleasuring forth, And with him went his chosen chum, the wild Wind of the North— When thus he spake—I give ye his words for what ye deem them worth: IV “Good friend and faithful crony mine!—you mark that high House yon— That is the Jesuits' Cloister-house, the far-famed House of Bonn; And well and dearly love I, Wind, its dwellers every one! V “So, you, my trump, just tarry here before the gate a space, Just wait while I step in a bit, and glance about the place; I want to see the Father Prior anent a conscience-case.” VI “Ha!” laughed the Wind, “that must be a Case of real Distress, no doubt! However, you yourself know best—so, in with you, old Trout! I'm safe to wait and whistle here until you again come out.” VII So said, so done: the Wind began its whistling there and then, And in the Arch-Deceiver stole, to tempt the holy men— Filled with all wiles and subtleties was he that hour, ye ken! VIII “Hail, pious friends!” quoth he—“I've got a conscience-case to moot. Pray, can I see your Prior's face?”—“Ay! and much more to boot,” A monk replied, “if he, in turn, may only see thy foot. IX “Avaunt, foul fiend! I know thee well! I guess thy crafty plot! Begone!—But no!—thou shalt not hence: I chain thee to this spot! Here shalt thou, till this House be dust, dree thine avenging lot!” X The monk then chained Old Clootie down, despite his yells and cries, And from that day—the Bonnsmen say—in thraldom thus he lies, Because, from dread of direr dole, he dares not try to rise. XI Meanwhile the Wind still waits without, and pipes in woful strain— It whistles now—it howls anon—it storms, but all in vain. Three hundred years have rolled, but Satan comes not forth again! XII And Time and Hell go on to swell the victories both have won, And many a generation since of monks has come and gone, But still before that Cloister wails the wonder-wind of Bonn! PATHETIC HYPATHETICS. (Schubart.) Were Hope all my eye, 'Tis a fact I should die— Her light is much brighter than ten tallow candles; When crotchets and cares are consuming Some fanciful spooney, she takes him Where cowslips and daisies are blooming, And never entirely forsakes him, Till Death lays him down in the box without handles. Handles, handles, The box without handles, Till Death lays him down in the box without handles. Were Friendship a hum I could weep o'er my rum, For I hate to be mixing companionless tumblers, Even mules, quoth Buffon, are gregarious, And cats when they turn caterwaulers; Et moi, I like various contrarious Assemblies—both punch-drinking bawlers And sighers of sighs—both your grinners and grumblers. Grumblers, grumblers, Your grinners and grumblers, I have grins for your grinners and growls for your grumblers. Were Love all a hoax, So that no one could coax A rich widow to wed, what could well be forlorner? To be wheedling some innocent charmer, Who reckons her thousands by thirties, And hasn't the heart to wear armour Against Cupid's arrows is, certes, Far better than moping alone in a corner. Corner, corner, Alone in a corner, More pleasant than kicking your heels in a corner! Were Music a bam I might chatter and cram, But a seal would be clapped on my Fountains of Feeling. Oh! nothing melts bosoms at all like The exquisite tones of a fiddle! I hop round the room at a ball, like A hen on a scorching hot griddle! Good lack! I could bound from the floor to the ceiling. Ceiling, ceiling, The floor to the ceiling, Next night, faith, I'll bob my big head through the ceiling. Were Wine all a quiz, I should wear a long phiz As I mounted each night to my ninth-story garret. Though Friendship, the traitress, deceives me, Though Hope may have long ceased to flatter, Though Music, sweet infidel, leaves me, Though Love is my torment, what matter! I've still such a thing as a rummer of claret. Claret, claret, A rummer of claret, I laugh and grow fat on my rummer of claret. A COUPLET. My heart is a monk, and thy bosom its cloister— So sleeps the bright pearl in the shell of the oyster! HAROUN AL-RASHID AND THE DUST. (From the Ottoman.) I am but dust, said Hassan, as he bowed His face to earth abashéd; And in my Khalif's glance I flourish or I wither! Since you are only dust, replied aloud The great Haroun Al-Rashid, Be good enough to say what wind has blown you hither! LOVE AND MADNESS. (From the Ottoman.) Il babeeb! thy heart's a rock; I must put my helm a-lee, Or my bark will soon be wrecked, if Love refuse to stay the shock. Ah, relent! for thee and me Life's but a brief perspective! Think how soon on Death's dark shore She who plagues and they who pine, Both Despoiler and Despoiled meet! Why must Medjnims evermore Drink their tears as wormwood wine, And devour their hearts as broiled meat? Thy fair face, whose light might guide Ships by night, is as a book Which Love's hand has writ at large in; And thy locks on either side, In their ink-black lustre look Like the glosses down its margin! Such a face, with such a heart!— Oh, 'tis ghastly! We men may Mourn our nature when we scan it; But let none take woman's part! Man at most is made of clay— Woman seems a block of granite! All day long I sulk and sculk To and fro till night, and then Slumber flies mine eye and eyelid. I must hire some cobbler's bulk, Watchman's box, or jackal's den, Where I may remain a while hid! I, once plump as Shiraz grape, Am, like Thalbh of thin renown, Grown most chasmy, most phantasmy, Yea, most razor-sharp in shape!— Fact! And if I'm—blown through town, I'll—cut all the sumphs who pass me!</field>
