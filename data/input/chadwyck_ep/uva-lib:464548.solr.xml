      <field name="fulltext">The Pearl. I. Perle plesaunte to prynces paye, To clanly clos in golde so clere, Oute of oryent I hardyly saye, Ne proued I neuer her precios pere, So rounde, so reken in vche araye, So smal, so smoþe her syde? were. Quere-so-euer I lugged gemme? gaye, I sette hyr sengeley in synglure; Allas! I leste hyr in on erbere, Þur? gresse to grounde hit fro me yot; I dewyne for-dolked of luf daungere, Of þat pryuy perle with-outen spot. Syþen in þat spote hit fro me sprange, Ofte haf I wayted wyschande þat wele, Þat wont wat? whyle deuoyde my wrange, &amp; heuen my happ &amp; al my hele, Þat dot? bot þrych my hert þrange, My breste in bale bot bolne &amp; bele. ?et þo?t me neuer so swete a sange, As stylle stounde let to me stele, For-soþe þer fleten to me fele, To þenke hir color so clad in clot; O moul þou marre? a myry mele. My priuy perle with-outen spotte, Þat spot of spyse? my?t nede? sprede, Þer such ryche? to rot is runnen; Blome? blayke &amp; blwe &amp; rede, Þer schyne? ful schyr agayn þe sunne. Flor &amp; fryte may not be fede, Þer hit doun drof in molde? dunne, For vch gresse mot grow of grayne? dede, No whete were elle? to wone? wonne; Of goud vche goude is ay by-gonne. So semly a sede mo?t fayly not, Þat spryngande spyce? vp ne sponne, Of þat precios perle wyth-outen spotte. To þat spot þat I in spech expoun I entred in þat erber grene, In augoste in a hy? seysoun, Quen corne is coruen wyth croke? kene. On huyle þer perle hit trendeled doun, Schadowed þis worte? ful schyre &amp; schene Gilofre, gyngure &amp; gromylyoun, &amp; pyonys powdered ay by-twene. ?if hit wat? semly on to sene, A fayre reflayr ?et fro hit flot, Þer wonys þat worþyly I wot &amp; wene, My precious perle, wyth-outen spot. Bifore þat spot my honde I spenn[e]d, For care ful colde þat to me ca?t[e]; A denely dele in my hert denned, Þa? resoun sette my seluen sa?t[e]. I playned my perl þat þer wat? spenned Wyth fyrte skylle? þat faste fa?t[e], Þa? kynde of kryst me comfort kenned, My wreched sylle in we ay wra?te. I felle vpon þat floury fla?t[e], Suche odour to my herne? schot; I slode vpon a slepyng sla?te, On þat prec[i]os perle with-outen spot. II. Fro spot my spyryt þer sprang in space, My body on balke þer bod in sweuen, My goste is gon in gode? grace, In auenture þer meruayle? meuen; I ne wyste in þis worlde quere þat hit wace, Bot I knew me keste þer klyfe? cleuen; Towarde a foreste I bere þe face, Where rych rokke? wer to dyscreuen; Þe ly?t of hem my?t no mon leuen, Þe glemande glory þar of hem glent; For wern neuer webbe? þat wy?e? weuen, Of half so dere adubmente. Dubbed wern alle þo downe? syde? With crystal klyffe? so cler of dynde, Holte-wode? bry?t aboute hem byde?; Of bolle? as blwe as ble of ynde, As bornyst syluer þe lef onslyde?, Þat þike con trylle on vch a tynde, Quen glem of glode? agayn? hem glyde?, Wyth schymeryng schene ful schrylle þay schynde. Þe grauayl þat on grounde con grynde Wern precious perle? of oryente; Þe sunne beme? bot blo &amp; blynde, In respecte of þat adubbement. The adubbemente of þo downe? dere Garten my goste al greffe for-?ete So frech flauore of fryte? were, As fode hit con ma fayre refete. Fowle? þer flowen in fryth in fere, Of flaumbande hwe?, 1boþe smale &amp; grete, Bot sytole stryng &amp; gyternere, Her reken myrþe mo?t not retrete, For quen þose brydde? her wynge? bete Þay songen sryth a swete asent; So grace [i]os gle couþe no mon gete As here &amp; se her adubbement. So al wat? dubbet on dere asyse; Þat fryth þer fortwne forth me fere?; Þe derþe þer-of for to deuyse Nis no wy? worþe þat tonge bere?. I welke ay forth in wely wyse, No bonk so byg þat did me dere?, Þe fyrre in þe fryth þe feier con ryse, Þe playn, þe plontte?, þe Spyse, þe pere? &amp; rawe? &amp; rande? &amp; rych reuere?, As fyldor fyn her b[o]nkes brent. I wan to a water by schore þat schere?, Lorde! dere wat? hit adubbement ! The Dubbemente of þo derworth depe Wern bonke? bene of beryl bry?t; Swangeande swete þe water con swepe Wyth a rownande rourde raykande ary?t; In þe founce þer stonden stone? stepe, As glente þur? glas þat glowed &amp; gly?t, A stremande sterne? quen stroþe men slepe, Staren in welkyn in wynter ny?t; For vche a pobbel in pole þer py?t Wat? Emerad, saffer, oþer gemme gente, Þat alle þe lo?e lemed of ly?t, So dere wat? hit adubbement. III. The dubbement dere of doun &amp; dale?; Of wod &amp; water &amp; wlonk playne?, Bylde in me blys, abated my bale?, For-didden my [dis]tresse, dystryed my payne?. Doun after a strem þat dry?ly hale?, I bowed in blys, bred ful my brayne?; Þe fyrre I fol?ed þose floty vale?, Þ more strenghþe of ioye myn herte strayne?, As fortune fares þer as ho frayne?, Wheþer solace ho sende oþer elle? sore, Þe wy?, to wham her wylle ho wayne?, Hytte? to haue ay more &amp; more. More of wele wat? in þat wyse Þen I cowþe telle þa? I tom hade, For vrþely herte my?t not suffyse To þe tenþe dole of þo gladne? glade; For-þy I þo?t þat paradyse Wat? þer oþer gayn þo bonke brade; I hoped þe water were a deuyse By-twene myrþe? by mere? made, By-?onde þe broke by slante oþer slade, I hope[de] þat mote merked wore. Bot þe water wat? depe I dorst not wade &amp; euer me longed a more &amp; more. More &amp; more, &amp; ?et wel mare, Me lyste to se þe broke by-?onde, For if hit wat? fayr þer I con fare, Wel loueloker wat? þe fyrre londe. Abowte me con I stote &amp; stare To fynde a forþe, faste con I fonde, Bot woþe? mo i-wysse þer ware, Þe fyrre I stalked by þe stronde, &amp; euer me þo?t I schulde not wonde For wo, þer wele? so wynne wore. Þenne nwe note me com on honde Þat meued my mynde ay more &amp; more, More meruayle con my dom adaunt; I se? by-?onde þat myry mere, A crystal clyffe ful relusaunt, Mony ryal ray con fro hit rere; At þe fote þer-of þer sete a faunt, A mayden of menske, ful debonere; Blysnande whyt wat? hyr bleaunt, (I knew hyr wel, I hade sen hyr ere) As glysnande golde þat man con schere, So schon þat schene an vnder schore; On lenghe I loked to hyr þer, Þe lenger I knew hyr more &amp; more The more I frayste hyr fayre face. Her fygure fyn, quen I had fonte, Suche gladande glory con to me glace, As lyttel byfore þerto wat? wonte; To calle hyr lyste con me enchace, Bot baysment gef myn hert a brunt, I se? hyr in so strange a place, Such a burre my?t make myn herte blunt Þenne vere? ho vp her fayre frount, Hyr vysayge whyt as playn yuore, Þat stonge myn hert ful stray atount, &amp; euer þe lenger, þe more &amp; more. IV. More þen me lyste my drede aros, I stod ful stylle &amp; dorste not calle, Wyth y?en open &amp; mouth ful clos, I stod as hende as hawk in halle; I hope þat gostly wat? þat porpose, I dred on ende quat schulde byfalle, Lest ho me eschaped þat I þer chos, Er I at steuen hir mo?t stalle. Þat gracios gay with-outen galle, So smoþe, so smal, so seme sly?t, Ryse? vp in hir araye ryalle, A prec[i]os pyece in perle? py?t Perle? py?te of ryal prys, Þere mo?t mon by grace haf sene, Quen þat frech as flor-de-lys, Doun þe bonke con bo?e by-dene. Al blysnande whyt wat? hir beau uiys, Vpon at syde? &amp; bounden bene Wyth þe myryeste margarys at my deuyse, Þat euer I se? ?et with myn y?en; Wyth lappe? large I wot &amp; I wene, Dubbed with double perle &amp; dy?te, Her cortel of self sute schene, With precios perle? al vmbe-py?te. A py?t coroune ?et wer þat gyrle, Of mariorys &amp; non oþer ston, Hi?e pynakled of cler quyt perle, Wyth flurted flowre? perfet vpon; To hed hade ho non oþer werle, Her here heke al hyr vmbe-gon; Her semblaunt sade, for doc oþer erle, Her ble more bla?t þen whalle? bon; As schorne golde schyr her fax þenne schon, On schyldere? þat leghe vnlapped ly?te; Her depe colour ?et wonted non, Of precios perle in porfyl py?te, Py?t wat? poyned &amp; vche a hemme, At honde, at syde?, at ouerture, Wyth whyte perle &amp; non oþer gemme, &amp; bornyste quyte wat? hyr uesture. Bot a wonder perle with-outen wemme, In mydde? hyr breste wat? sette so sure; A manne? dom mo?t dry?ly demme, Er mynde mo?t malte in hit mesure; I hope no tong mo?t endure No sauerly saghe say of þat sy?t, So wat? hit clene &amp; cler &amp; pure, Þat precios perl þer hit wat? py?t, Py?t in perle þat precios p[r]yse. On wyþer half water com doun þe shore, No gladder gome heþen in to grece, Þen I, quen he on brymme wore; Ho wat? me nerre þen aunte or nece, My Ioy for-þy wat? much þe more. Ho profered me speche þat special spyce, Enclynande lowe in wommon lore, Ca?te of her coroun of grete tresore, &amp; haylsed me wyth a lote ly?te. Wel wat? me þat euer I wat? bore, To sware þat swete in perle? py?te! V. “On perle,” quod I, “in perle? py?t, Art þou my perle þat I haf playned, Regretted by myn one, on ny?te? Much longeyng haf I for ?e layned, Syþen into gresse þou me agly?te; Pensyf, payred, I am for-payned, &amp; þou in a lyf of lykyng ly?te In paradys erde, of stryf vnstrayned. What wyrde hat? hyder my iuel vayned, &amp; don me in þys del &amp; gret daunger? Fro we in twynne wern towen &amp; twayned, I haf ben a Ioyle? Iuelere” That Iuel þenne in gemmy? gente, Vered vp her vyse with y?en graye, Set on hyr coroun of perle orient, &amp; soberly after þenne con ho say: “Sir ?e haf your tale myse-tente, To say your perle is al awaye, Þat is in cofer, so comly clente, As un þis gardyn gracios gaye, Here-inne to lenge for euer &amp; play. Þer mys nee mornyng com neuer here, Her were a forser for þe in faye, If þou were a gentyl Iucler. Bot Iueler gente if þou schal lose Þy ioy for a gemme þat þe wat? lef, Me þynk þe put in a mad porpose, &amp; busye? þe aboute a raysoun bref, For þat þou leste? wat? bot a rose, Þat flowred &amp; rayled as kynde hyt gef; Now þur? kynde of þe kyste þat hyt con close, To a perle of prys hit is put in pref; &amp; þou hat? called þy wyrde a þef, Þat o?t of mo?t hat? mad þe cler; Þou blame? þe bote of þy meschef, Þou art no kynde Iueler.” A Iuel to me þen wat? þys geste, &amp; iuele? wern hyr gentyl sawe?” “I-wyse,” quod I, “my blysfol beste, My grete dystresse þou al to-drawe?, To be excused I make requeste; I trawed my perle don out of dawe?, Now haf I fonde hyt I schal ma feste, &amp; wony with hyt in schyr wod schawe?, &amp; loue my lorde &amp; al his lawe?, Þat hat? me bro?[t] þys blys ner; Now were I at yow by-?onde þise wawe?, I were a ioyfol Iueler.” “Iueler,” sayde þat gemme clene, “Wy borde ?e men, so madde ?e be? Þre worde? hat? þou spoken at ene, Vn-avysed, for soþe, wern alle þre, Þou ne woste in worlde quat on dot? mene, Þy worde byfore þy wytte con fle. Þou says þou Trawe? me in þis dene, By cawse þou may with y?en me se; Anoþer þou says, in þys countre Þy self schal won with me ry?t here; Þe þrydde, to passe þys water fre, Þat may no ioyfol Iueler. VI. I halde þat iueler lyttel to prayse, Þat loue? wel þot he se? wyth y?e, &amp; much to blame &amp; vn-cortoyse, Þat loue? oure lorde wolde make a ly?e, Þat lelly hy?te your lyf to rayse, Þa? fortune dyd your flesch to dy?e; ?e setten hys worde? ful westernays Þat loue? no þynk bot ?e hit sy?e, &amp; þat is a poynt o sorquydry?e, Þat vche god mon may euel byseme To leue no tale be true to try?e, Bot ?at hys one skyl may dem[e].

Thenne demed I to þat damyselle Ne worþe no wrath þe vnto my lorde, If rapely raue spornande in spelle.

In blysse I se þe blyþely blent &amp; I a man al mornyf mate, ?e take þer-on ful lyttel tente, Þa? I hente ofte harme? hate. Bot now I am here in your presente, I wolde bysech wythouten debate, ?e wolde me say in sobre asente, What lyf ?e lede, erly &amp; late, For I am ful fayn þat your astate Is worþen to worschyp &amp; wele Iwysse, Of alle my Ioy þe hy?e gate Hit is in grounde of alle my blysse.” “Now blysse burne mot þe bytyde;” Þen sayde þat lufsoum of lyth &amp; lere “&amp; welcum here to walk &amp; byde, For now þy speche is to me dere; Maysterful mod &amp; hy?e pryde I hete þe arn heterly hated here; My lorde ne loue? not forto chyde, For meke arn alle þat wone? hym nere, &amp; when in hys place þou schal apere, Be dep deuote in hol mekenesse; My lorde þe lamb, loue? ay such chere, Þat is þe grounde of alle my blysse. A blysful lyf þou says I lede, Þou wolde? knaw þer-of þe stage; Þow wost wel when þy perle con schede, I wat? ful ?ong &amp; tender of age, Bot my lorde þe lombe, þur? hys god-hede, He toke my self to hys maryage, Corounde me quene in blysse to brede, In lenghe of daye? þat euer schal wage, &amp; sesed in alle hys herytage Hys lef is, I am holy hysse; Hys prese, hys prys &amp; hys parage, Is rote &amp; grounde of alle my blysse.” VIII. “Blysful,” quod I, “may þys be trwe, Dysplese? not if I speke errour; Art þou þe quene of heuene? blwe, Þat al þys worlds schal do honour? We leuen on marye þat grace of grewe, Þat ber a barne of vyrgyn flour, Þe croune fro hyr quo mo?t remwe, Bot ho hir passed in sum fauour? Now for synglerty o hyr dousour, We calle hyr fenyx of arraby, Þat freles fle?e of hyr fasor, Lyk to þe quen of cortaysye.” “Cortayse quen” þenne s[a]yde þat gaye, Knelande to grounde, folde vp hyr face, “Makele? moder &amp; myryest may, Blessed bygynner of vch a grace!” Þenne ros ho vp &amp; con restay, &amp; speke me towarde in þat space: “Sir fele here porchase? &amp; fonge? pray Bot supplantore? none with-inne þys place; Þat emperise al heuen? hat?, &amp; vrþe &amp; helle in her bayly; Of erytage ?et non wyl ho chace, For ho is quen of cortaysye.

Bot my lady of quom Iesu con spryng, Ho halde? þe empyre ouer vus ful hy?e, &amp; þat dysplese? non of oure gyng, For ho is quene of cortaysye. Of courtaysye, as sayt? saynt poule, Al arn we membre? of ihesu kryst, As heued &amp; arme &amp; legg &amp; naule, Temen to hys body ful trwe &amp; t[r]yste; Ry?t so is vch a krysten sawle, A longande lym to þe mayster of myste; Þenne loke what hate oþer any gawle, Is tached oþer ty?ed þy lymme? by-twyste, Þy heued hat? nauþer greme ne gryste, On arme oþer fynger, þa? þou ber by?e; So fare we alle wyth luf &amp; lyste, To kyng &amp; quene by cortaysye.” “Cortayse,” quod I, “I leue &amp; charyte grete be yow among, Bot my speche þat yow ne greue, Þy self in heuen ouer hy? þou heue, To make þe quen þat wat? so ?onge, What more-hond mo?te he acheue Þat hade endured in worlde stronge, &amp; lyued in penaunce hys lyue? longe, With bodyly bale hym blysse to byye?

That cortayse is to fre of dede, ?yf hyt be soth þat þou cone? saye, Þou lyfed not two ?er in oure þede, Þou cowþe? neuer god nauþer plese ne pray, Ne neuer nawþer pater ne crede, &amp; quen mad on þe fyrst day!

X. The date of þe daye þe lorde con knaw, Called to þe reue “lede pay þe meyny, Gyf hem þe hyre þat I hem owe, &amp; fyrre, þat non me may repreue, Set hem alle vpon a rawe, &amp; gyf vehon in-lyche a peny.

The ry?twys man also sertayn Aproche he schal þat proper pyle, Þat take? not her lyf in vayne Ne glauere? her nie?bor wyth no gyle; Of þys ry?t-wys sa? salamon playn, How kyntly oure con aquyle By waye? ful stre?t he con hym strayn, &amp; scheued hym þe rengne of god a whyle, As quo says “lo ?on louely yle, Þou may hit wynne if þou be wy?te,” Bot hardyly with-oute peryle, Þe innosent is ay saue by ry?te! An-ende ry?twys men, ?et sayt? a gome Dauid in sauter, if euer ?e se? hit, “Lorde þy seruaunt dra? neuer to dome, For non lyuyande to þe is Iustyfyet.” For-þy to corte quen þou schal com, Þer alle oure cause? schal be tryed, Alegge þe ry?t þou may be in-nome, By þys ilke spech I haue asspyed; Bot he on rode þat blody dyed, Delfully þur? honde? þry?t Gyue þe to passe when þou arte tryed By innocens &amp; not by ry?te.

His dessypele? with blame let be hym bede, &amp; wyth her resoune? ful fele restayed; Ihesuc þenne hem swetely sayde, “Do way, let chylder vnto me ty?t, To suche is heuen-ryche arayed,” Þe innocent is ay saf by ry?t.

Þat wro?t þy wede, he wat? ful wys; Þy beaute com neuer of nature, Pymalyon paynted neuer þy vys, Ne arystotel nawþer by hys lettrure Of carpe þe kynde þese properte?.

In Ierusalem wat? my lemman slayn &amp; rent on rode with boye? bolde; Al oure bale? to bere ful bayn, He toke on hym self oure care? colde, With boffete? wat? hys face flayn, Þat wat? so fayr on to byholde; For synne he set hym self in vayn, Þat neuer hade non hym self to wolde, For vus he lette hym fly?e &amp; folde &amp; brede vpon a bostwys bem, As meke as lomb þat no playnt tolde. For vus he swalt in Ierusalem: Ierusalem, Iordan &amp; galalye, Þer as baptysed þe goude saynt Ion, His worde? acorded to ysaye; When Ihesuc con to hym warde gon He sayde of hym þys professye, “Lo gode? lombe as trwe as ston, Þat dot? away þe synne? dry?e!” Þat alle þys worlde hat? wro?t vpon, Hym self ne wro?t neuer ?et non, Wheþer on hym self he con al clem, Hys generacyoun quo recen con, Þat dy?ed for vus in Ierusalem? In Ierusalem þus my lemman swatte, Twye?, for lombe wat? taken þere, By trw recorde of ayþer prophete, For mode so meke &amp; al hys fare, Þe þryde tyme is þer-to ful mete In apokalype? wryten ful ?are.

As Iohan þe apostel hit sy? with sy?t I sy?e þat cyty of gret renoun, Ierusalem so nwe &amp; ryally dy?t, As hit wat? ly?t fro þe heuen adoun. Þe bor? wat? al of brende golde bry?t, As glemande glas burnist broun, With gentyl gemme? an-vnder py?t; With bantele? twelue on basyng boun, Þe foundemente? twelue of riche tenoun; Vch tabelment wat? a serlype? ston, As derely deuyse? þis ilk toun, In apocalyppe? þe apostel Iohan.

As Iohan hym wryte? ?et more I sy?e Vch pane of þat place had þre ?ate?, So twelue in poursent I con asspye Þe portale? pyked of rych plate? &amp; vch ?ate of a margyrye, A parfyt perle þat neuer fate?; Vchon in scrypture a name con plye, Of israel barne? folewande her date?, Þat is to say as her byrþ whate?; Þe aldest ay fyrst þer-on wat? done. Such ly?t þer lemed in alle þe strate? Hem nedde nawþer sunne ne mone. Of sunne ne mone had þay no nede Þe self god wat? her lompe ly?t, Þe lombe her lantyrne with-outen drede, Þur? hym blysned þe bor? al bry?t.

Sunne ne mone schon neuer so swete; A! þat foysoun flode out of þat flet, Swyþe hit swange þur? vch a strete, With-outen fylþe oþer galle oþer glet.

An-vnder mone so gret merwayle No fleschly hert ne my?t endeure, As quen I blusched vpon þat baly, So ferly þer-of wat? þe falure.

Ry?t as þe maynful mone con rys, Er þenne þe day-glem dryue al doun, So sodanly on a wonder wyse, I wat? war of a prosessyoun. Þis noble cite of ryche enpresse Wat? sodanly ful with-outen sommoun Of such vergyne? in þe same gyse Þat wat? my blysful an-vnder croun, &amp; coronde wern alle of þe same fasoun Depaynt in perle? &amp; wede? qwyte, In vchone? breste war? bounden boun, Þe blysful perle with gret delyt. With gret delyt þay glod in fere, On golden gate? þat glent as glasse; Hundreth þowsande? I wot þer were, &amp; alle in sute her liure? wasse, Tor to knaw þe gladdest chere. Þe lombe byfore con proudly passe, Wyth horne? seuen of red golde cler, As praysed perle? his wede? wasse; Towarde þe throne þay trone a tras. Þa? þay wern fele no pres in plyt, Bot mylde as maydene? seme at mas, So dro? þay forth with gret delyt. Delyt þat hys come encroched, To much hit were of for to melle; Þise alder men quen he aproched, Grouelyng to his fete þay felle; Legyounes of aungele? togeder uoched, Þer kesten ensens of swete smelle, Þen glory &amp; gle wat? nwe abroched. Al songe to loue þat gay Iuelle, Þe steuen mo?t stryke þur? þe vrþe to helle, Þat þe vertues of heuen of Ioye endyte, To loue þe lombe his meyny in melle, I-wysse I la?t a gret delyt; Delit þe lombe forto deuise, With much meruayle in mynde went. Best wat? he, blyþest &amp; moste to pryse, Þat euer I herde of speche spent, So worþly whyt wern wede? hys; His loke? symple, hym self so gent, Bot a wounde ful wyde &amp; weete con wyse An-ende hys hert þur? hyde to-rente; Of his quyte syde his blod out-sprent, A-las þo?t I, who did þat spyt? Ani breste for bale a?t haf for-brent, Er he þer-to hade had delyt. The lombe delyt non lyste to wene, Þa? he were hurt &amp; wounde hade, In his sembelaunt wat? neuer sene, So wern his glente? gloryous glade. I loked among his meyny schene, How þay wyth lyf wern laste &amp; lade, Þen sa?

Þat sy?t me gart to þenk to wade, For luf longyng in gret delyt. XXI. Delyt me drof in y?e &amp; ere, My mane? mynde to maddyng malte; Quen I se? my frely I wolde be þere, By?onde þe water, þa? ho were walte, I þo?t þat no þyng my?t me dere To fech me bur &amp; take me halte; &amp; to start in þe strem schulde non me stere, To swymme þe remnaunt, þa?

A longeyng heuy me strok in swone, &amp; rewfully þenne I con to reme; “O perle,” quod I, “of rych renoun, So wat? hit me dere þat þou con deme, In þys veray avysyoun; If hit be ueray &amp; soth sermoun, Þat þou so styke? in garlande gay, So wel is me in þys doel doungoun, Þat þou art to þat prynse? paye.” To þat prynce? paye hade I ay bente, &amp; ?erned no more þen wat? me geuen, &amp; halden me þer in trwe entent, As þe perle me prayed þat wat? so þryuen, As helde drawen to godde? present, To mo of his mysterys I hade ben dryuen. Bot ay wolde man of happe more hente Þen mo?ten by ry?t vpon hem clyuen; Þer-fore my ioye wat? sone to-riuen, &amp; I kaste of kythe? þat laste? aye. Lorde! mad hit arn þat agayn þa stryuen, Oþer proferen þe o?t agayn þy paye; To pay þe prince oþer sete sa?te, Hit is ful eþe to þe god krystyin; For I haf founden hym boþe day &amp; na?te, A god, a lorde, a frende ful fyin. Ouer þis hyl þis lote I la?te, For pyty of my perle enclyin, &amp; syþen to god I hit by-ta?te, In kryste? dere blessyng &amp; myn, Þat in þe forme of bred &amp; wyn, Þe preste vus schewe? vch a daye; He gef vus to be his homly hyne, Ande precious perle? vnto his pay.

Þen laled Loth, “lorde what is best?

Þise aungele? hade hem by hande out at þe ?ate?, Prechande hem þe perile, &amp; beden hem passe fast, “Lest ?e be taken in þe teche of tyraunte? here, Loke ?e bowe now bi bot, bowe? fast hence!” &amp; þay kayre-ne con &amp; kenely flowen; Erly, er any heuen glem, þay to a hil comen.

Clowdde? clustered bytwene kesten vp torres, Þat þe þik þunder þrast þirled hem ofte. Þe rayn rueled adoun, ridlande þikke, Of felle flaunkes of fyr &amp; flakes of soufre, Al in smolderande smoke smachande ful ille, Swe aboute Sodamas &amp; hit syde? alle, Gorde to Gomorra þat þe grounde laused; Abdama and Syboym, þise ceteis alle faure, Al bi-rolled wyth þe rayn, rostted &amp; brenned, &amp; ferly flayed þat folk þat in þose fees lenged; For when þat þe helle herde þe hounde? of heuen He wat? ferlyly fayn, vnfolded by lyue.

He sete on Salamones solie, on solemne wyse, Bot of leaute he wat? lat to his lorde hende; He vsed abominaciones of idolatrye, &amp; lette ly?t bi þe lawe þat he was lege tylle; For-þi oure fader vpon folde a foman hym wakned, Nabigo-de-no?ar nuyed hym swyþe. He pursued in to Palastyn with proude men mony, &amp; þer he wast wyth with werre þe wones of þorpes. He her?ed vp al Israel &amp; hent of þe beste, &amp; þe gentylest of Iudee in Ierusalem biseged, Vmbe-walt alle þe walles wyth wy?es ful stronge, At vche a dor a do?ty duk, and dutte hem wyth-inne; For þe bor? wat? so bygge baytayled alofte, &amp; stoffed wyth-inne with stout men to stalle hem þer-oute. Þenne wat? þe sege sette þe Cete aboute, Skete skarmoch skelt, much skaþe lached; At vch brugge a berfray on basteles wyse, Þat seuen syþe vch a day asayled þe ?ates, Trwe tulkkes in toures teneled wyth-inne, In bigge brutage of borde, bulde on þe walles; Þay fe?t &amp; þay fende of, &amp; fylter togeder Til two ?er ouer-torned, ?et tok þay hit neuer. At þe laste vpon longe, þo ledes wyth-inne, Faste fayled hem þe fode, enfaminied monie; Þe hote hunger wythinne hert hem wel sarre, Þen any dunt of þat douthe þat dowelled þer-oute. Þenne wern þo rowtes redeles in þo ryche wones, Fro þat mete wat? myst, megre þay wexen, &amp; þay stoken so strayt, þat þay ne stray my?t A fote fro þat forselet to forray no goudes. Þenne þe kyng of þe kyth a counsayl hym takes, Wyth þe best of his burnes, a blench for to make; Þay stel out on a stylle ny?t er any steuen rysed, &amp; harde hurles þur? þe oste, er enmies hit wyste, Bot er þay at-wappe ne mo?t þe wach wyth oute, Hi?e skelt wat? þe askry þe skewes an-vnder, Loude alarom vpon launde lulted was þenne; Ryche, ruþed of her rest, ran to here wedes, Hard hattes þay hent &amp; on hors lepes; Cler claryoun crak cryed on-lofte.

Þe kynges sunnes in his sy?t he slow euer vchone, &amp; holkked out his auen y?en heterly boþe &amp; bede þe burne to be bro?t to Babyloyn þe ryche, &amp; þere in dongoun be don to dre?e þer his wyrdes. Now se, so þe soueray[n] set hat? his wrake; Nas hit not for Nabugo ne his noble nauther, Þat oþer depryued wat? of pryde with paynes stronge, Bot for his beryng so badde agayn his blyþe lorde; For hade þe fader ben his frende þat hym bifore keped, Ne neuer trepast to him in teche of mysseleue. To Colde wer alle Calde &amp; kythes of Ynde, ?et take Torkye hem wyth her tene hade ben little; ?et nolde neuer Nabugo þis ilke note leue, Er he hade tuyred þis toun &amp; torne hit to grounde; He ioyned vnto Ierusalem a gentyle duc þenne, His name wat?

Þay slowen of swettest semlych burdes, Baþed barnes in blod &amp; her brayn spylled; Prestes &amp; prelates þay presed to deþe, Wyues &amp; wenches her wombes to-coruen, Þat her boweles out-borst aboute þe diches, &amp; al wat? carfully kylde þat þay cach my?t, &amp; alle [þat] swypped vn-swol?ed of þe sworde kene, Þay wer cagged and ka?t on capeles al bare, Festned fettres to her fete vnder fole wombes, &amp; broþely bro?t to Babyloyn þer bale to suffer, To sytte in seruage &amp; syte; þat sumtyme wer gentyle, Now ar chaunged to chorles &amp; charged wyth werkkes, Boþe to cayre at þe kart &amp; þe kuy mylke, Þat sumtyme sete in her sale syres &amp; burdes. &amp; ?et Nabu?ardan nyl neuer stynt, Er he to þe tempple tee wyth his tulkkes alle; Betes on þe barers, brestes vp þe ?ates, Slouen alle at a slyp þat serued þer-inne, Pulden prestes by þe polle &amp; plat of her hedes, Di?ten dekenes to deþe, dungen doun clerkkes, &amp; alle þe maydenes of þe munster ma?tyly hokyllen Wyth þe swayf of þe sworde þat swol?ed hem alle. Þenne ran þay to þe relykes as robbors wylde, &amp; pyled alle þe apparement þat pented to þe kyrke, Þe pure pyleres [o]f bras pourtrayd in golde, &amp; þe chef chaundeler charged with þe ly?t, Þat ber þe lamp vpon lofte, þat lemed euer more, Bifore þ[e] sancta sanctorum þer selcouth wat? ofte.

Alle he spoyled spytously in a sped whyle, Þat Salomon so mony a sadde ?er so?t to make, Wyth alle þe coyntyse þat he cowþe clene to wyrke; Deuised he þe vesselment, þe vestures clene, Wyth sly?t of his ciences, his souerayn to loue, Þe hous &amp; þe anournementes he hy?tled togeder. Now hat? Nabu?ardan numnend hit al samen, &amp; syþen bet doun þe bur? &amp; brend hit in askes; Þenne wyth legiounes of ledes ouer londes he rydes, Her?e? of Israel þe hyrne aboute. Wyth charged chariotes þe cheftayne he fynde[?], Bikennes þe catel to þe kyng, þat he ca?t hade, Presented him þe prisoneres in pray þat þay token, Moni a worþly wy?e whil her worlde laste, Moni semly syre soun, &amp; swyþe rych maydenes, Þe pruddest of þe province, &amp; prophetes childer; As Ananie &amp; A?arie &amp; als Mi?ael, &amp; dere Daniel also, þat wat? deuine noble, With moni a modey moder chylde mo þen innoghe. &amp; Nabu-go-de-no?ar makes much ioye, Nov he þe kyng hat? conquest &amp; þe kyth wunnen, &amp; dreped alle þe do?tyest &amp; derrest in armes, &amp; þe lederes of her lawe layd to þe grounde, &amp; þe pryce of þe profecie prisoners maked; Bot þe ioy of þe iuelrye so gentyle &amp; ryche, When hit wat? schewed hym so schene, scharp wat? his wonder, Of such vessel auayed þat vayled so huge, Neuer ?et nas Nabugo-de-no?ar er þenne. He sesed hem with solemneté, þe souerayn he praysed, Þat wat? aþel ouer alle, Israel dry?tyn; Such god, such gomes, such gay vesselles Comen neuer out of kyth, to Caldee reames. He trussed hem in his tresorye in a tryed place Rekenly wyth reuerens, as he ry?t hade; &amp; þer he wro?t as þe wyse, as ?e may wyt here-after, For hade he let of hem ly?t, hym mo?t haf lumpen worse. Þat ryche in gret rialté rengned his lyue, As conquerour of vche a cost he cayser wat? hatte, Emperour of alle þe erþe &amp; also þe saudan, &amp; als þe god of þe grounde wat? grauen his name &amp; al þur? dome of Daniel, fro he deuised hade, Þat alle goudes com of god, &amp; gef hit hym bi samples, Þat he ful clanly bi-cuv-er his carp bi þe laste, &amp; ofte hit mekned his mynde, his maysterful werkkes. Bot al drawes to dy?e with doel vp[o]n ende; Bi a haþel neuer so hy?e he heldes to grounde, &amp; so Nabugo-de-no?ar as he nedes moste; For alle his empire so hi?e in erþe is he grauen.

Bot honoured he not hym þat in heuen wonies, Bot fals fantummes of fendes, formed with handes Wyth tool out of harde tre, &amp; telded on lofte, &amp; of stokkes &amp; stones, he stoute goddes call?

For if þou redes hit by ry?t &amp; hit to resoun brynges, Fyrst telle me þe tyxte of þe tede lettres, &amp; syþen þe mater of þe mode, mene me þer-after, &amp; I schal halde þe þe hest þat I þe hy?t haue; Apyke þe in porpre cloþe, palle alþer-fynest, &amp; þe by?e of bry?t golde abowte þyn nekke, &amp; þe þryd þryuenest þat þrynges me after, Þou schal be baroun vpon benche, bede I þe no lasse.” Derfly þenne Danyel deles þyse wordes: “Ryche kyng of þis rengne rede þe oure lorde, Hit is surely soþe, þe souerayn of heuen Fylsened euer þy fader &amp; vpon folde cheryched, Gart hym grattest to be of gouernores alle, &amp; alle þe worlde in his wylle welde as hym lykes. Who-so wolde wel do, wel hym bityde, &amp; quos deth so he de?yre he dreped als faste; Who-so hym lyked to lyfte, on lofte wat? he sone, &amp; quo-so hym lyked to lay, wat? lo?ed bylyue. So wat? noted þe note of Nabugo-de-no?ar, Styfly stabled þe rengne bi þe stronge dry?tyn, For of þe hy?est he hade a hope in his hert, Þat vche pouer past out of þat prynce euen; &amp; whyle þat wat? cle?t clos in his hert, Þere wat? no mon vpon molde of my?t as hym seluen, Til it bitide on a tyme, towched hym pryde For his lordeschyp so large, &amp; his lyf ryche; He hade so huge an insy?t to his aune dedes, Þat þe power of þe hy?e prynce he purely for?etes. Þenne blynnes he not of blasfemy on to blame þe dry?tyn, His my?t mete to goddes he made with his wordes: “I am God of þe grounde, to gye as me lykes, As he þat hy?e is in heuen his aungels þat weldes; If he hat? formed þe folde &amp; folk þer vpone, I haf bigged Babiloyne, bur? alþer-rychest, Stabled þer-inne vche a ston in strenkþe of myn armes, Mo?t neuer my?t bot myn make such anoþer.” Wat? not þis ilke worde wonnen of his mowþe one, Er þenne þe souerayn sa?e souned in his eres, “Now Nabugo-de-no?ar inno?e hat? spoken, Now is alle þy pryncipalté past at ones, &amp; þou, remued fro monnes sunnes, on mor most abide, &amp; in wasterne walk &amp; wyth þe wylde dowelle, As best, byte on þe bent of braken &amp; erbes, With wroþe wolfes to won &amp; wyth wylde asses.” In mydde þe poynt of his pryde departed he þere, Fro þe soly of his solempneté, his solace he leues, &amp; carfully is out-kast to contré vnknawen, Fer into a fyr fryth þere frekes neuer comen. His hert heldet vnhole, he hoped non oþer Bot a best þat he be, a bol oþer an oxe. He fares forth on alle faure, fogge wat? his mete, &amp; ete ay as a horce when erbes were fallen, Þus he countes hym a kow, þat wat? a kyng ryche, Quyle seuen syþe? were ouer-seyed someres I trawe. By þat, mony þik þy?e þry?t vmbe his lyre, Þat alle wat? dubbed and dy?t in þe dew of heuen; Faxe fyltered, &amp; felt flosed hym vmbe, Þat schad fro his schulderes to his schyre wykes, &amp; twenty-folde twynande hit to his tos ra?t Þer mony clyuy as clyde hit cly?t togeder. His berde I-brad alle his breste to þe bare vrþe, His browes bresed as breres aboute his brode chekes; Hol?e were his y?en &amp; vnder campe hores, &amp; al wat? gray as þe glede, with ful grymme clawres Þat were croked and kene as þe kyte panne; Erne hwed he wat? &amp; al ouer-brawden, Til he wyst ful wel who wro?t alle my?tes, &amp; cowþe vche kyndam to-kerue &amp; keuer when hym lyked; Þenne he wayned hym his wyt þat hade wo soffered, Þat he com to knawlach &amp; kenned hym seluen, Þenne he laued þat lorde &amp; leued in trawþe, Hit wat? non oþer þen he þat hade al in honde. Þenne sone wat? he sende agayn, his sete restored; His barounes bo?ed hym to, blyþe of his come, Ha?erly in his aune hwe his heued was couered, &amp; so ?eply wat? ?arked &amp; ?olden his state. Bot þou Balta?ar his barne &amp; his bolde ayre, Se? þese syngnes with sy?t &amp; set hem at lyttel, Bot ay hat? hofen þy hert agaynes þe hy?e dry?tyn, With bobaunce &amp; with blasfamye bost at hym kest, &amp; now his vessayles avyled in vanyté vnclene, Þat in his hows hym to honour were heuened of fyrst; Bifore þe baroun? hat? hom bro?t, &amp; byrled þerinne Wale wyne to þy wenches in waryed stoundes; Bifore þy borde hat? þou bro?t beuerage in þede, Þat blyþely were fyrst blest with bischopes hondes, Louande þer-on lese godde?, þat lyf haden neuer, Made of stokkes &amp; stone? þat neuer styry mo?t. &amp; for þat froþande fylþe, þe fader of heuen Hat? sende, hat? sende in-to þis sale þise sy?tes vncowþe, Þe fyste with þe fyngeres þat flayed þi hert, Þat rasped renyschly þe wo?e with þe ro? penne. Þise ar þe wordes here wryten with-oute werk more, By vch fygure, as I fynde, as oure fader lykes. “Mane, Techal, Phare?, merked in þrynne, Þat þretes þe of þyn vnþryfte vpon þre wyse; Now expowne þe þis speche spedly I þenk. Mane menes als-much-as, maynful Gode Hat? counted þy kyndam bi a clene noumbre, &amp; ful-fylled hit in fayth to þe fyrre ende.

Pacience is a poynt, þa? hit displease ofte, When heuy herttes ben hurt wyth heþyng oþer elles, Suffraunce may aswagen hem &amp; þe swelme leþe, For ho quelles vche a qued, &amp; quenches malyce; For quo-so suffer cowþe syt, sele wolde fol?e, &amp; quo for þro may no?t þole, þe þikker he sufferes; Þen is better ot abyde þe bur vmbe-stoundes, Þen ay þrow forth my þro, þa? me þynk ylle. I herde on a halyday at a hy?e masse, Howw mathew melede, þat hiw mayster his meyny con teche, A?t happes he hem hy?t &amp; vche on a mede, Sunderlupes for hit dissert vpon a ser wyse: Thay arn hapen þat han in hert pouerté, For hores is þe heuen-ryche to holde for euer; Þay ar happen also þat haunte mekenesse, For þay schal welde þis worlde &amp; alle her wylle haue; Thay ar happen also þat for her harme wepes, For þay schal comfort encroche in kythes ful mony; Þay ar happen also þat hungeres after ry?t, For þay schal frely be refete ful of alle gode; Thay ar happen also þat han in hert rauþe, For mercy in alle maneres her mede schal worþe; Þay ar happen also þat arn of hert clene, For þay her sauyour in sete schal se with her y?en; Thay ar happen also þat halden her pese, For þay þe gracious godes sunes schal godly be called; Þay ar happen also þat con her hert stere, For hores is þe heuen-ryche, as I er sayde. These arn þe happes alle a?t þat vus bihy?t weren, If we þyse ladyes wolde lof in lyknyng of þewes; Dame pouert, Dame pitee, Dame penaunce þe þrydde, Dame Mekenesse, Dame mercy &amp; Miry clanesse, &amp; þenne Dame þes &amp; pacyance prt in þer-after. He were happen þat hade one, alle were þe better, Bot syn I am put to a poynt þat pouerte hatte, I schal me poruay pacyence, &amp; play me with boþe; For in þe tyxte, þere þyse two arn in teme layde, Hit arn fettled in on forme, þe forme &amp; þe laste, &amp; by quest of her quoyntyse enquylen on mede, &amp; als in myn vpnyoun hit arn of on kynde; For þer as pouert hir proferes ho nyl be put vtter, Bot lenge where-so-euer hir lyst oþer greme, &amp; þere as pouert enpresses, þa? mon pyne þynk, Much maugre his mun, he mot nede suffer, Thus pouerte &amp; pacyence arn nedes play-feres. Syþhen I am sette with hem samen, suffer me by-houes, Þenne is me ly?tloker hit lyke &amp; her lotes prayse, Þenne wyþer wyth &amp; be wroth &amp; þe wers haue. ?if me be dy?t a destyne due to haue, What dowes me þe dedayn, oþer dispit make? Oþer ?if my lege lorde lyst on lyue me to bidde, Oþer to ryde, oþer ot renne, to rome in his ernde, What grayþed me þe grychchyng bot grame more seche? Much ?if he me ne made, maugref my chekes, &amp; þenne þrat moste I þole, &amp; vnþonk to mede, Þe[t] had bowed to his bode, bongre my hyure. Did not Ionas in Iude suche Iape sum-whyle, To sette hym to sewrte, vnsounde he hym feches? Wyl ?e tary a lyttel tyme &amp; tent me a whyle, I schal wysse yow þer-wyth as holy wryt telles. II. Hit bi-tydde sum-tyme in þe termes of Iude, Ionas ioyned wat? þer-inne ientyle prophete; Goddes glam to hym glod, þat hym vnglad made, With a roghlych rurd rowned in his ere; “Rys radly,” he says,“&amp; rayke forth euen, Nym þe way to nynyue, wyth-outen oþer speche, &amp; in þat cete my sa?es soghe alle aboute, Þat, in þat place at þe poynt, I put in þi hert; For I wysse hit arn so wykke þat in þat won dowelle?, &amp; her malys is so much I may not abide, Bot venge me on her vilanye &amp; venym bilyue; Now swe?e me þider swyftly &amp; say me þis arende.” When þat steuen wat? stynt, þat stowned his mynde, Al he wrathed in his wyt &amp; wyperly he þo?t, If I bowe to his bode &amp; bryng hem þis tale, &amp; I be Nummen in Nuniue, my nyes begynes; He telles me þose traytoures arn typped schrewes, I com wyth þose tyþynges, þay ta me bylyue, Pyne? me in a prysoun, put me in stokkes, Wryþe me in a warlok, wrast out myn y?en. Þis is a meruayl message a man for to preche, Amonge enmyes so mony &amp; mansed fendes; Bot if my gaynlych god such gref to me wolde, For desert of sum sake þat I slayn were, At alle peryles, quod þe prophete, I aproche hit no nerre, I wyl me sum oþer waye, þat he ne wayte after; I schal tee in-to taree, &amp; tary þere a whyle, &amp; ly?tly, when I am lest, he letes me alone. Þenne he ryses radly, &amp; raykes bilyue Ionas toward port Iaph, ay Ianglande for tene, Þat he nolde þole, for no-þyng, non of þose pynes, Þa? þe fader þat hym formed were fale of his hele. “Ouro syro syttes,” he says, “on sege so hy?e In his g[l]wande glorye, &amp; gloumbes ful lyttel, Þa? I be nummen in nuniue &amp; naked dispoyled, On rode rwyly to-rent, with rybaudes mony.” Þus he passes to þat port, his passage to seche, Fyndes he a fayr schyp to þe fare redy; Maches hym with þe maryneres, makes her paye, For to towe hym in-to tarce, as tyd as þay my?t. Then he tron on þo tres &amp; þay her tramme ruchen, Cachen vp þe crossayl, cables þay fasten, Wi?t at þe wyndas we?en her ankres, Sprude spak to þe sprete þe spare bawe-lyne Gederen to þe gyde ropes, þe grete cloþ falles; Þay layden in on ladde-borde &amp; þe lofe wynnes. Þe blyþe breþe at her bak þe bosum he fyndes, He swenges me þys swete schip swefte fro þe hauen. Wat? neuer so Ioyful a Iue, as Ionas wat? þenne, Þat þe daunger of dry?tyn so derfly ascaped; He wende wel þat þat wy? þat al þe world planted, Hade no ma?t in þat mere no man forto greue. Lo! þe wytles wrechche, for he wolde no?t suffer, Now hat? he put hym in plyt of peril wel more; Hit wat? a wenyng vn-war þat welt in his mynde, Þa? he were so?t fro samarye þat god se? no fyrre, ?ise he blusched ful brode, þat burde hym by sure, Þat ofte kyd hym þe carpe þat kyng sayde, Dynge dauid on des, þat demed þis speche, In a psalme þat he set þe sauter with-inne; O Fole? in folk fere? oþer whyle, &amp; vndersondes vmbe-stounde, þa? he be stape fole, Hope ?e þat he heres not þat eres alle made? Hit may not be þat he is blynde þat bigged vche y?e. Bot he dredes no dynt þat dotes for elde, For he wat? fer in þe flod foundande to tarce; Bot, I trow, ful tyd, ouer-tan þat he were, So þat schomely to schort he schote of his ame. For þe welder of wyt, þat wot alle þynges, Þat ay wakes &amp; waytes, at wylle hat? he sly?tes; He calde on þat ilk crafte he carf with his hondes, Þay wakened wel þe wroþeloker, for wroþely he cleped: “Erwus &amp; aquiloun, þat on est sittes, Blowes boþe at my bode vpon blo watteres.” Þenne wat? no tom þer bytwene his tale &amp; her dede, So bayn wer þay boþe two, his bone for to wyrk. An-on out of þe norþ est þe noys bigynes, When boþe breþes con blowe vpon blo watteres; Ro? rakkes þer ros with rudnyng an-vnder, Þe see sou?ed ful sore, gret selly to here; Þe wyndes on þe wonne water so wrastel to-geder, Þat þe wawes ful wode waltered so hi?e, &amp; efte busched to þe abyme þat breed fysches; Durst nowhere for ro? arest at þe bothem. When þe breth &amp; þe brok &amp; þe bote metten, Hit wat? a ioyles gyn þat Ionas wat? inne, For hit reled on roun[d] vpon þe ro?e yþes. Þe bur ber to hit baft þat braste alle her gere, Þen hurled on a hepe þe helme &amp; þe sterne, Furst to murte mony rop &amp; þe mast after. Þe sayl sweyed on þe see, þenne suppe bihoued Þe coge of þe colde water, &amp; þenne þe cry ryses; ?et coruen þay þe cordes &amp; kest al þer-oute. Mony ladde þer forth-lep to laue &amp; kest, Scopen out þe scalpel water, þat fayn scape wolde; For be monnes lode neuer so luþer, þe lyf is ay swete. Þer wat? busy ouer-borde bale to kest Her bagges, &amp; her feþer beddes, &amp; bryst wedes, Her kysttes, &amp; her coferes, here caraldes alle, &amp; al to ly?ten þat lome, ?if leþe wolde schape; Bot eyer wat? ilyche loud þe lot of þe wyndes, &amp; euer wroþer þe water, &amp; wodder þe stremes. Þen þo wery for-wro?t wyst no bote, Bot vehon glewed on his god þat gayned hym beste; Summe to vernagu þer vouched a-vowes solemne, Summe to diana deuout, &amp; derf nepturne, To mahoun &amp; to mergot, þe mone &amp; þe sunne, &amp; vehe lede as he loued &amp; layde had his hert. Þenne bispeke þe spakest dispayred wil nere: I leue here be sum losynger, sum lawles wrech, Þat hat? greued his god &amp; got? here amonge vus; Lo al synkes in his synne &amp; for his sake marres! I lovne þat we lay lotes on ledes vchone, &amp; who-so lympes þe losse, lay hym þer-oute; &amp; quen þe gulty is gon what may gome trawe, Bot he þat rules þe rak may rwe on þose oþer? Þis wat? sette in asent, &amp; sembled þay were, Her?ed out of vche hyrne to hent þat falles. A lodes-mon ly?tly lep vnder hachches, For to layte mogledes &amp; hem to lote bryng, Bot hym fayled no freke þat he fynde my?t, Saf Ionas þe Iwe þat Iowked in derne. He wat? flowen for ferde of þe flode lotes In-to þe boþem of þe bot, &amp; on a brede lyggede, On helde by þe hurrok, for þe heuen wrache, Slypped vpon a sloumbe, selepe, &amp; sloberande he routes. Þe freke hym frunt with his fot &amp; bede hym ferk vp, Þer ragnel in his rakentes hym rere of his dremes; Bi þe haspede he hentes hym þenne, &amp; bro?t hym vp by þe brest &amp; vpon borde sette, Arayned hym ful runyschly what raysoun he hade In such sla?tes of sor?e to slepe so faste; Sone haf þay her sortes sette &amp; serelych deled, &amp; ay þe lote, vpon laste, lymped on Ionas. Þenne ascryed þay hym sekete, &amp; asked ful loude, “What þe deuel hat? þou don, doted wrech? What seches þoue on see, synful schrewe, With þy lastes so luþer to lose vus vchone?

Lorde! colde wat? his cumfort &amp; his care huge, For he knew vehe a cace &amp; kark þat hym lymped; How fro þe bot in-to þe blober wat? with a best lachched, &amp; þrwe in at hit þrote, with-outen þret more, As mote in at a munster dor, so mukel wern his chawle?, He glydes in by þe giles, þur? glaymande glette, Relande in by a rop, a rode þat hym þo?t, Ay hele ouer hed, hourlande aboute, Til he blunt in a blok as brod as a halle; &amp; þer he festnes þe fete &amp; fathme? aboute, &amp; stod vp in his stomak, þat stank as þe deuel; Þer in saym &amp; in sor?e þat sauoured as helle, Þer wat? bylded his bour, þat wyl no bale suffer; &amp; þenne he lurkkes &amp; laytes where wat? le best, In vehe a nok of his nauel, bot nowhere he fynde? No rest ne recouerer, bot ramelande myre, In wych gut so euer he got?; bot euer is god swete; &amp; þer he lenged at þe last &amp; to þe lede called. “Now prynce, of þy prophete pité þou haue! Þa? I be fol, &amp; fykel, &amp; falce of my hert, De-woyde now þy vengaunce, þur? vertu of rauthe; Tha? I be gulty of gyle as gaule of prophetes, Þou art god, &amp; alle gowde? ar grayþely þyn owen; Haf now mercy of þy man &amp; his mys-dedes, &amp; preue þe ly?tly a lorde, in londe &amp; in water.” With þat he hitte to a hyrne &amp; helde hym þer-inne, Þer no de-foule of no fylþe wat? fest hym abute; Þer he sete also sounde, saf for merk one, As in þe bulk of þe bote, þer he by-fore sleped. So in a bouel of þat best he bide? on lyue, Þre dayes &amp; þ[r]e ny?t ay þenkande on dry?tyn, His my?t &amp; his merci, his mesure þenne; Now he knawe? hym in care þat couþe not in sele. Ande euer walteres þis whal bi wyldren depe, Þur? mony a regioun ful ro?e, þur? ronk of his wylle, For þat mote in his mawe mad hym, I trowe, Þa? hit lyttel were, hym wyth to wamel at his hert, Ande assayled þe segge; ay sykerly he herde Þe bygge borne on his bak &amp; bete on his sydes; Þen a prater ful prest þe prophete þer maked On þis wyse, as I wene, his worde? were mony: IV. “Lorde to þe haf I eleped, in care? ful stronge, Out of þe hole þou me herde, of hellen wombe I calde, &amp; þou knew myn vncler steuen; Þou dipte? me of þe depe se, in-to þe dymme hert, Þe grete flem of þy flod folded me vmbe; Alle þe gote? of þy guferes, &amp; groundele? powle?, &amp; þy stryuande streme? of strynde? so mony, In on daschande dam, dryue? me ouer; &amp; ?et I say, as I seet in þe se boþem, ‘Care-ful am I kest out fro þy cler y?en &amp; deseuered fro þy sy?t; ?et surely I hope, Efte to trede on þy temple &amp; teme to þy seluen. I am wrapped in water to my wo stounde?, Þe abyme byndes þe body þat I byde inne; Þe pure poplande hourle playes on my heued, To laste mere of Vche a mount man am I fallen; Þe barre? of vche a bonk ful bigly me haldes, Þat I may lachche no lont &amp; þou my lyf weldes; Þou schal releue me renk, whil þy ry?t slepe?, Þur? my?t of þy mercy þat mukel is to tryste. For when pacces of anguych wat? hid in my sawle, Þenne I remembred me ry?t of my rych lorde, Prayande him for petè his prophete to here, Þat in-to his holy hous myn orisoun mo?t entre. I haf meled with þy maystres mony longe day, Bot now I wot wyterly, þat þose vnwyse ledes Þat affyen hym in vanyté &amp; in vayne þynges, For þink þat mountes to no?t, her mercy forsaken; Bot I dewoutly awowe þat verray bet? halden, Soberly to do þe sacrafyse when I schal saue worþe, &amp; offer þe for my hele a ful hol gyfte, &amp; halde goud þat þou me hetes; haf here my trauthe.” Thenne oure fader to þe fysch ferslych bidde?, Þat he hym sput spakly vpon spare drye; Þe whal wende? at his wylle &amp; warþe fynde?, &amp; þer he brake? vp þe buryne, as bede hym oure lorde. Þenne he swepe to þe sonde in sluchched cloþes, Hit may wel be þat mester were his mantyle to wasche; Þe bonk þat he blosched to &amp; bode hym bisyde, Wern of þe regiounes ry?t þat he renayed hade; Þenne a wynde of godde? worde efte þe wy?e bruxle?, “Nylt þou neuer to nuniue bi no-kynne? waye??” “?isse lorde,” quod þe lede, “lene me þy grace For to go at þi gre, me gayne? non oþer.” “Ris, aproche þen to prech, lo þe place here! Lo! my lore is in þe loke, lance hit þer-inne.” Þenne þe renk radly ros as he my?t, &amp; to niniue þat ma?t he ne?ed ful euen; Hit wat? a ceté ful syde &amp; selly of brede, On to þrenge þer-þurze wat? þre dayes dede. Þat on Iournay ful Ioynt Ionas hym ?ede, Er euer he warpped any worde to wy?e þat he mette, &amp; þenne he cryed so cler, þat kenne my?t alle; Þe trwe tenor of his teme he tolde on þis wyse: “?et schal forty daye? fully fare to an ende, &amp; þenne schal Niniue be nomen &amp; to no?t worþe; Truly þis ilk toun schal tylte to grounde, Vp-so-doun schal ?e dumpe depe to þe abyme, To be swol?ed swyftly wyth þe swart erþe, &amp; alle þat lyuyes here-inne lose þe swete.” Þis speche sprang in þat space &amp; spradde alle aboute, To borges &amp; to bacheleres, þat in þat bur? lenged; Such a hidor hem hent &amp; hatel drede, Þat al chaunged her chere &amp; chylled at þe hert. Þe segge sesed not ?et, bot sayde euer ilyche “Þe verray vengaunce of god schal voyde þis place.” Þenne þe peple pitosly pleyned ful stylle, &amp; for þe drede of dry?tyn doured in hert; Heter hayre? þay hent þat asperly bited, &amp; þose þay bounden to her bak &amp; to her bare syde?, Dropped dust on her hede &amp; dymly biso?ten, Þat þat penaunce plesed him þat playne? on her wronge. &amp; ay he cryes in þat kyth tyl þe kyng herde; &amp; he radly vp-ros &amp; ran fro his chayer, His ryche robe he to-rof of his rigge naked, &amp; of a hep of askes he hitte in þe mydde?; He aske? heterly a hayre &amp; hasped hym vmbe, Sewed a sekke þer abof, &amp; syked ful colde; Þer he dased in þat duste, with droppande teres, Wepande ful wonderly alle his wrange dedes. Þenne sayde he to his seriauntes, “samnes yow bilyue, Do dryue out a decre demed of my seluen, Þat alle þe bodyes þat ben with-inne þis bor? quyk, Boþe burnes &amp; bestes, burde? &amp; childer, Vch prynce, vche prest &amp; prelates alle, Alle faste frely for her falce werkes; Sese? childer of her sok, soghe hem so neuer, Ne best bite on no brom, ne no bent nauþer, Passe to no pasture, ne pike non erbes, Ne non oxe to no hay, ne no horse to water; Al schal crye for-clemmed, with alle oure clere strenþe, Þe rurd schal ryse to hym þat rawþe schal haue; What wote oþer wyte may ?if þe wy?e lykes, Þat is hende in þe hy?t of his gentryse? I wot his my?t is so much, þa? he be mysse-payed, Þat in his mylde amesyng he mercy may fynde; &amp; if we leuen þe layk of oure layth synnes, &amp; stylle steppen in þe sty?e he sty?tle? hym seluen, He wyl wende of his wodschip, &amp; his wrath leue, &amp; for-gif vus þis gult ?if we hym god leuen.” Þenne al leued on his lawe &amp; laften her synnes, Par-formed alle þe penaunce þat þe prynce radde; &amp; god þur? his godnesse forgef as he sayde, Þa? he oþer bihy?t, [&amp;] with-helde his vengaunce. V. Muche sor?e þenne satteled vpon segge Ionas, He wex as wroth as þe wynde towarde oure lorde, So hat? anger onhit his hert; he calle? A prayer to þe hy?e prynce, for pyne, on þys wyse: “I bische þe syre now þou self iugge, Wat? not þis ilk my worde þat worþen is nouþe, Þat I kest in my cuntre, when þou þy carp sende?, Þat I schulde tee to þys toun, þi talent to preche? Wel knew I þi cortaysye, þy quoynt soffraunce. Þy bounté of debonerté &amp; þy bene grace, Þy longe abydyng wyth lur, þy late vengaunce, &amp; ay þy mercy is mete, be mysse neuer so huge. I wyst wel when I hade worded quatsoeuer I cowþe, To manace alle þise mody men þat in þis mote dowelle?, Wyth a prayer &amp; a pyne þay my?t her pese gete, &amp; þer-fore I wolde haf flowen fer in-to tarce. Now lorde lach out my lyf, hit lastes to longe, Bed me bilyue my bale stour, &amp; bryng me on ende, For me were swetter to swelt, as swyþe as me þynk, Þen lede lenger þi lore, þat þus me les make?.” Þe soun of oure souerayn þen swey in his ere, Þat vpbraydes þis burne vpon a breme wyse: “Herk renk! is þis ry?t so ronkly to wrath, For any dede þat I haf don oþer demed þe ?et?” Ionas al Ioyles &amp; Ianglande vp-ryses &amp; halde? out on est half of þe hy?e place, &amp; farandely on a felde he fettele? hym to bide, For to wayte on þat won what schulde worþe after. Þer he busked hym a bour, þe best þat he my?t, Of hay &amp; of euer-ferne &amp; erbe? a fewe, For hit wat? playn in þat place for plyande greue? For to schylde fro þe schene, oþer any schade keste. He bowed vnder his lyttel boþe, his bak to þe sunne, &amp; þer he swowed &amp; slept sadly al ny?t, Þe whyle god of his grace ded growe of þat soyle, Þe fayrest bynde hym abof þat euer burne wyste. When þe dawande day dry?tyn con sende, Þenne wakened þe wy? vnder wodbynde, Loked alofte on þe lef þat lylled grene; Such a lefsel of lof neuer lede hade, For hit wat? brod at þe boþem, bo?ted onlofte, Happed vpon ayþer half a hous as hit were, A nos on þe norþ syde &amp; nowhere non elle?, Bot al schet in a scha?e þat schaded ful cole. Þe gome gly?t on þe grene graciouse leues, Þat euer wayued a wynde so wyþe &amp; so cole; Þe schyre sunne hit vmbe-schon, þa? no schafte my?t Þe mountaunce of a lyttel mote, vpon þat man schyne, Þenne wat? þe gome so glad of his gay logge, Lys loltrande þer-inne, lokande to toune, So blyþe of his wodbynde he balteres þer vnde[r], Þat of no diete þat day þe deuel haf, he ro?t; &amp; euer he la?ed as he loked þe loge alle aboute, &amp; wysched hit were in his kyth, þer he wony schulde, On he?e vpon Effraym oþer enmonnes hille?, “I-wysse a worþloker won to welde I neuer keped.” &amp; quen hit ne?ed to na?t nappe hym bihoued; He slyde? on a sloumbe, slep sloghe vnder leues, Whil god wayned a worme þat wrot vpe þe rote, &amp; wyddered wat? þe wodbynde bi þat þe wy?e wakned; &amp; syþen he warne? þe west to waken ful softe, &amp; saye? vnte ?eferus þat he syfle warme, Þat þer quikken no cloude bi-fore þe cler sunne, &amp; ho schal busch vp ful brode &amp; brenne as a candel. Þen wakened þe wy?e of his wyl dremes, &amp; blusched to his wodbynde þat broþely wat? marred, Al welwed &amp; wasted þo worþelych leues; Þe schyre sunne hade hem schent, er euer þe schalk wyst, &amp; þen hef vp þe hete &amp; heterly brenned; Þe warm wynde of þe weste wertes he swyþe?. Þe man marred on þe molde þat mo?t hym not hyde, His wodbynde wat? away, he weped for sor?e, With hatel anger &amp; hot, heterly he calle?: A! þou maker of man, what maystery þe þynke? Þus þy freke to forfare forbi alle oþer, With alle meschef þat þou may, neuer þou me spare?? I keuered me a cumfort þat now is ca?t fro me, My wod-bynde so wlonk þat wered my heued, Bot now I se þou art sette my solace to reue; Why ne dy?tte? þou me to di?e; I dure to longe?” ?et oure lorde to þe lede lansed a speche: “Is þis ry?t-wys þou renk, alle þy ronk noyse, So wroth for a wodbynde to wax so sone, Why art þou so waymot wy?e for so lyttel?” “Hit is not lyttel,” quod þe lede, “bot lykker to ry?t, I wolde I were of þis worlde wrapped in molde?.” “Þenne byþenk þe mon, if þe for-þynk sore, If I wolde help my honde werk, haf þou no wonder; Þou art waxen so wroth for þy wod-bynde, &amp; trauaylede? neuer to tent hit þe tyme of an howre, Bot at a wap hit here wax &amp; away at an oþer, &amp; ?et lyke? þe so luþer, þi lyf wolde? þou tyne; Þenne wyte not me for þe werk þat I hit wolde help, &amp; rwe on þo redles þat remen fpr synne.

Wer I as hastif a[s] þou, heere were harme lumpen, Couþe I not þole bot as þou þer þryued ful fewe; I may not be so mal[i]cious &amp; mylde be halden, For malyse is no?[t] mayntyne boute mercy withinne; Be no?t so gryndel god man, bot go forth þy wayes.” Be preue &amp; be pacient, in payne &amp; in Ioye, For he þat is to rakel to renden his cloþe?, Mot efte sitte with more vn-sounde to sewe hem togeder. For-þy when pouerte me enprece? &amp; payne? in-no?e, Ful softly with suffraunce sa?ttel me bihoue?, For þe penaunce &amp; payne to preue hit in sy?t, Þat pacience is a nobel poynt, þa? hit displese ofte.
