      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. WITH Explanatory Notes and Additions never before printed. Hæc studia adolescentiam alunt, senectutem oblectant; secundas res ornant, adversis perfugium &amp; solatium præbent; delectant domi, non impediunt foris; pernoctant nobiscum, peregrinantur, rusticantur. Tully. On Mr. Pope and his Poems, By his Grace JOHN SHEFFIELD, Duke of Buckingham. With Age decay'd, with Courts and bus'ness tir'd, Caring for nothing but what Ease requir'd; Too dully serious for the Muse's sport, And from the Critics safe arriv'd in Port; I little thought of launching forth agen, Amidst advent'rous Rovers of the Pen; And after so much undeserv'd success, Thus hazarding at last to make it less. Encomiums suit not this censorious time, Itself a subject for satyric rhime; Ignorance honour'd, Wit and Worth defam'd, Folly triumphant, and ev'n Homer blam'd! But to this Genius, join'd with so much Art, Such various Learning mix'd in ev'ry part, Poets are bound a loud applause to pay; Apollo bids it, and they must obey. And yet so wonderful, sublime a thing, As the great Iliad, scarce could make me sing; Except I justly could at once commend A good Companion, and as firm a Friend. One moral, or a meer well-natur'd deed, Can all desert in Sciences exceed. 'Tis great delight to laugh at some men's ways, But a much greater to give Merit praise. To Mr. Pope, on his Pastorals. In these more dull, as more censorious days, When few dare give, and fewer merit Praise; A Muse sincere, that never Flatt'ry knew, Pays what to friendship and desert is due. Young, yet judicious; in your verse are found Art strengthning Nature, Sense improv'd by Sound. Unlike those Wits, whose numbers glide along So smooth, no thought e'er interrupts the song: Laboriously enervate they appear, And write not to the head, but to the ear: Our minds unmov'd and unconcern'd they lull, And are at best most musically dull; So purling streams with even murmurs creep, And hush the heavy hearers into sleep. As smoothest speech is most deceitful found, The smoothest numbers oft' are empty sound. But Wit and Judgment join at once in you, Sprightly as Youth, as Age consummate too: Your strains are regularly bold, and please With unforc'd care, and unaffected ease, With proper thoughts, and lively images: Such as by Nature to the Ancients shown, Fancy improves, and Judgment makes your own: For great men's fashions to be follow'd are, Altho' disgraceful 'tis their clothes to wear. Some in a polish'd style write Pastoral, Arcadia speaks the language of the Mall; Like some fair Shepherdess, the Sylvan Muse, Should wear those flow'rs her native fields produce; And the true measure of the shepherd's wit Should, like his garb, be for the country fit: Yet must his pure and unaffected thought More nicely than the common swains be wrought. So, with becoming art, the Players dress In silks, the shepherd, and the shepherdess; Yet still unchang'd the form and mode remain, Shap'd like the homely russet of the swain. Your rural Muse appears to justify The long-lost graces of Simplicity: So rural beauties captivate our sense With virgin charms, and native excellence. Yet long her Modesty those charms conceal'd, 'Till by men's Envy to the world reveal'd; For Wits industrious to their trouble seem, And needs will envy what they must esteem. Live and enjoy their spite! nor mourn that fate, Which wou'd, if Virgil liv'd, on Virgil wait; Whose Muse did once, like thine, in plains delight; Thine shall, like his, soon take a higher flight; So Larks, which first from lowly fields arise, Mount by degrees, and reach at last the skies. W. WYCHERLEY. TO Mr. Pope, on his Windsor-Forest. Hail, sacred Bard! a Muse unknown before Salutes thee from the bleak Atlantic shore. To our dark world thy shining page is shown, And Windsor's gay retreat becomes our own. The Eastern pomp had just bespoke our care, And India pour'd her gaudy treasures here: A various spoil adorn'd our naked land, The pride of Persia glitter'd on our strand, And China's Earth was cast on common sand: Toss'd up and down the glossy fragments lay, And dress'd the rocky shelves, and pav'd the painted bay. Thy treasures next arriv'd: and now we boast A nobler Cargo on our barren coast: From thy luxuriant Forest we receive More lasting glories than the East can give. Where-e'er we dip in thy delightful page, What pompous scenes our busy thoughts engage! The pompous scenes in all their pride appear, Fresh in the page, as in the grove they were. Nor half so true the fair Lodona shows The sylvan state that on her border grows, While she the wond'ring shepherd entertains With a new Windsor in her wat'ry plains: Thy juster lays the lucid wave surpass, The living scene is in the Muse's glass. Nor sweeter notes the echoing Forests chear, When Philomela sits and warbles there, Than when you sing the greens, and opening glades, And give us Harmony as well as Shades: A Titian's hand might draw the grove, but you Can paint the grove, and add the Music too. With vast variety thy pages shine; A new creation starts in ev'ry line. How sudden trees rise to the reader's sight, And make a doubtful scene of shade and light, And give at once the day, at once the night! And here again what sweet confusion reigns, In dreary deserts mix'd with painted plains! And see! the deserts cast a pleasing gloom; And shrubby heaths rejoice in purple bloom: Whilst fruitful crops rise by their barren side, And bearded groves display their annual pride. Happy the Man, who strings his tuneful lyre, Where woods, and brooks, and breathing fields inspire! Thrice happy you! and worthy best to dwell Amidst the rural joys you sing so well. I in a cold, and in a barren clime, Cold as my thought, and barren as my rhime, Here on the Western beach attempt to chime. O joyless flood! O rough tempestuous main! Border'd with weeds, and solitudes obscene! Snatch me, ye Gods! from these Atlantic shores, And shelter me in Windsor's fragrant bow'rs; Or to my much-lov'd Isis' walks convey, And on her flow'ry banks for ever lay. Thence let me view the venerable scene, The awful dome, the groves eternal green: Where sacred Hough long found his fam'd retreat, And brought the Muses to the sylvan seat, Reform'd the wits, unlock'd the Classic store, And made that Music which was Noise before. There with illustrious Bards I spent my days, Nor free from censure, nor unknown to praise, Enjoy'd the blessings that his reign bestow'd, Nor envy'd Windsor in the soft abode. The golden minutes smoothly danc'd away, And tuneful Bards beguil'd the tedious day: They sung, nor sung in vain, with numbers fir'd That Maro taught, or Addison inspir'd. Ev'n I essay'd to touch the trembling string: Who cou'd hear them, and not attempt to sing? Rouz'd from these dreams by thy commanding strain, I rise, and wander thro' the field or plain; Led by thy Muse from sport to sport I run, Mark the stretch'd line, or hear the thund'ring gun. Ah! how I melt with pity, when I spy On the cold earth the flutt'ring Pheasant lie; His gaudy robes in dazling lines appear, And ev'ry feather shines and varies there. Nor can I pass the gen'rous courser by, But while the prancing steed allures my eye, He starts, he's gone! and now I see him fly O'er hills and dales, and now I lose the course, Nor can the rapid sight pursue the flying horse. Oh cou'd thy Virgil from his orb look down, He'd view a courser that might match his own! Fir'd with the sport, and eager for the chace, Lodona's murmurs stop me in the race. Who can refuse Lodona's melting tale? The soft complaint shall over time prevail; The Tale be told, when shades forsake her shore, The Nymph be sung, when she can flow no more. Nor shall thy song, old Thames! forbear to shine, At once the subject and the song divine. Peace, sung by thee, shall please ev'n Britons more Than all their shouts for Victory before. Oh! cou'd Britannia imitate thy stream, The world should tremble at her awful name: From various springs divided waters glide, In diff'rent colours roll a diff'rent tyde, Murmur along their crooked banks a while, At once they murmur and enrich the Isle, A while distinct thro' many channels run, But meet at last, and sweetly flow in one; There joy to lose their long-distinguish'd names, And make one glorious, and immortal Thames. FR. KNAPP. To Mr. Pope, In imitation of a Greek Epigram on Homer. When Phœbus, and the nine harmonious maids, Of old assembled in the Thespian shades; What theme, they cry'd, what high immortal air, Befit these harps to sound, and thee to hear? Reply'd the God; “Your loftiest notes employ, “To sing young Peleus, and the fall of Troy. The wond'rous song with rapture they rehearse; Then ask who wrought that miracle of verse? He answer'd with a frown; “I now reveal “A truth, that Envy bids me not conceal: “Retiring frequent to this Laureat vale, “I warbled to the Lyre that fav'rite tale, “Which, unobserv'd, a wand'ring Greek and blind, “Heard me repeat, and treasur'd in his mind; “And fir'd with thirst of more than mortal praise, “From me, the God of Wit, usurp'd the bays. But let vain Greece indulge her growing fame, Proud with celestial spoils to grace her name; Yet when my Arts shall triumph in the West, And the White Isle with female pow'r is blest; Fame, I foresee, will make reprizals there, And the Translator's Palm to me transfer. With less regret my claim I now decline, The World will think his English Iliad mine. E. FENTON. To Mr. Pope. To praise, and still with just respect to praise A Bard triumphant in immortal bays, The Learn'd to show, the Sensible commend, Yet still preserve the province of the Friend; What life, what vigour must the lines require? What Music tune them, what Affection fire? O might thy Genius in my bosom shine! Thou should'st not fail of numbers worthy thine; The brightest Ancients might at once agree To sing within my lays, and sing of thee. Horace himself wou'd own thou dost excell In candid arts to play the Critic well. Ovid himself might wish to sing the Dame Whom Windsor-Forest sees a gliding stream: On silver feet, with annual Osier crown'd, She runs for ever thro' Poetic ground. How flame the glories of Belinda's Hair, Made by thy Muse the envy of the Fair? Less shone the tresses Ægypt's Princess wore, Which sweet Callimachus so sung before. Here courtly trifles set the world at odds; Belles war with Beaus, and Whims descend for Gods. The new Machines, in names of ridicule, Mock the grave frenzy of the Chimic fool. But know, ye Fair, a point conceal'd with art, The Sylphs and Gnomes are but a Woman's heart. The Graces stand in sight; a Satyr-train Peeps o'er their head, and laughs behind the scene. In Fame's fair Temple, o'er the boldest wits Inshrin'd on high, the sacred Virgil sits; And sits in measures, such as Virgil's Muse To place thee near him, might be fond to chuse. How might he tune th'alternate reed with thee, Perhaps a Strephon thou, a Daphnis he; While some old Damon, o'er the vulgar wise, Thinks he deserves, and thou deserv'st the Prize. Rapt with the thought, my fancy seeks the plains, And turns me shepherd while I hear the strains. Indulgent nurse of ev'ry tender gale, Parent of flowrets, old Arcadia hail! Here in the cool my limbs at ease I spread, Here let thy Poplars whisper o'er my head! Still slide thy waters, soft among the trees, Thy Aspins quiver in a breathing breeze! Smile all ye valleys, in eternal spring, Be hush'd, ye winds, while Pope and Virgil sing. In English lays, and all sublimely great, Thy Homer warms with all his ancient heat; He shines in Council, thunders in the Fight, And flames with ev'ry sense of great delight. Long has that Poet reign'd, and long unknown, Like Monarchs sparkling on a distant throne; In all the Majesty of Greek retir'd, Himself unknown, his mighty name admir'd; His language failing, wrapt him round with night; Thine, rais'd by thee, recalls the work to light. So wealthy Mines, that ages long before Fed the large realms around with golden Ore, When choak'd by sinking banks, no more appear, And shepherds only say, The mines were here: Should some rich youth (if nature warm his heart, And all his projects stand inform'd with art) Here clear the caves, there ope the leading vein; The mines detected flame with gold again. How vast, how copious, are thy new designs! How ev'ry Music varies in thy lines! Still, as I read, I feel my bosom beat, And rise in raptures by another's heat. Thus in the wood, when summer dress'd the days While Windsor lent us tuneful hours of ease, Our ears the lark, the thrush, the turtle blest, And Philomela sweetest o'er the rest: The shades resound with song—O softly tread, While a whole season warbles round my head. This to my friend—and when a friend inspires, My silent harp its master's hand requires, Shakes off the dust, and makes these rocks resound; For fortune plac'd me in unfertile ground: Far from the joys that with my soul agree, From wit, from learning—very far from thee. Here moss-grown trees expand the smallest leaf; Here half an Acre's corn is half a sheaf; Here hills with naked heads the tempest meet, Rocks at their sides, and torrents at their feet; Or lazy lakes, unconscious of a flood, Whose dull brown Naiads ever sleep in mud. Yet here Content can dwell, and learned Ease, A Friend delight me, and an Author please; Ev'n here I sing, when Pope supplies the theme, Shew my own love, tho' not increase his fame. T. PARNELL. To Mr. Pope. Let vulgar souls triumphal arches raise, Or speaking marbles to record their praise; And picture (to the voice of Fame unknown) The mimic feature on the breathing stone; Mere mortals! subject to death's total sway, Reptiles of earth, and beings of a day! 'Tis thine, on ev'ry heart to grave thy praise, A monument which Worth alone can raise: Sure to survive, when time shall whelm in dust The arch, the marble, and the mimic bust: Nor 'till the volumes of th'expanded sky Blaze in one flame, shalt thou and Homer die: Then sink together, in the world's last fires, What heav'n created, and what heav'n inspires. If aught on earth, when once this breath is fled, With human transport touch the mighty dead, Shakespear, rejoice! his hand thy page refines; Now ev'ry scene with native brightness shines; Just to thy fame, he gives thy genuine thought; So Tully publish'd what Lucretius wrote; Prun'd by his care, thy laurels loftier grow, And bloom afresh on thy immortal brow. Thus when thy draughts, O Raphael! time invades, And the bold figure from the canvass fades, A rival hand recalls from ev'ry part Some latent grace, and equals art with art; Transported we survey the dubious strife, While each fair image starts again to life. How long, untun'd, had Homer's sacred lyre Jarr'd grating discord, all extinct his fire? This you beheld; and taught by heav'n to sing Call'd the loud music from the sounding string. Now wak'd from slumbers of three thousand years, Once more Achilles in dread pomp appears, Tow'rs o'er the field of death; as fierce he turns, Keen flash his arms, and all the Hero burns; With martial stalk, and more than mortal might, He strides along, and meets the Gods in fight: Then the pale Titans, chain'd on burning floors, Start at the din that rends th'infernal shores, Tremble the tow'rs of heav'n, earth rocks her coasts, And gloomy Pluto shakes with all his ghosts. To ev'ry theme responds thy various lay; Here rowls a torrent, there Meanders play; Sonorous as the storm thy numbers rise, Toss the wild waves, and thunder in the skies; Or softer than a yielding virgin's sigh, The gentle breezes breathe away and die. Thus, like the radiant God who sheds the day, You paint the vale, or gild the azure way; And while with ev'ry theme the verse complies, Sink without groveling, without rashness rise. Proceed, great Bard! awake th'harmonious string, Be ours all Homer! still Ulysses sing. How long Odyssey, lib. 16. that Hero, by unskilful hands, Stript of his robes, a Beggar trod our lands? Such as he wander'd o'er his native coast, Shrunk by the wand, and all the warrior lost: O'er his smooth skin a bark of wrinkles spread; Old age disgrac'd the honours of his head; Nor longer in his heavy eye-ball shin'd The glance divine, forth-beaming from the mind. But you, like Pallas, ev'ry limb infold With royal robes, and bid him shine in gold; Touch'd by your hand, his manly frame improves With grace divine, and like a God he moves. Ev'n I, the meanest of the Muses train, Inflam'd by thee, attempt a nobler strain; Advent'rous waken the Mæolian lyre, Tun'd by your hand, and sing as you inspire: So arm'd by great Achilles for the fight, Patroclus conquer'd in Achilles' right: Like theirs, our Friendship! and I boast my name To thine united—for thy Friendship's Fame. This labour past, of heav'nly subjects sing, While hov'ring angels listen on the wing, To hear from earth such heart-felt raptures rise, As, when they sing, suspended hold the skies: Or nobly rising in fair Virtue's cause, From thy own Life transcribe th'unerring laws: Teach a bad world beneath her sway to bend; To verse like thine fierce savages attend, And men more fierce: when Orpheus tunes the lay, Ev'n fiends relenting hear their rage away. W. BROOME. To Mr. Pope, on the publishing his Works. He comes, he comes! bid ev'ry Bard prepare The song of triumph, and attend his Car. Great Sheffield's Muse the long procession heads, And throws a lustre o'er the pomp she leads, First gives the Palm she fir'd him to obtain, Crowns his gay brow, and shows him how to reign. Thus young Alcides, by old Chiron taught, Was form'd for all the miracles he wrought: Thus Chiron did the youth he taught applaud, Pleas'd to behold the earnest of a God. But hark what shouts, what gath'ring crouds rejoice! Unstain'd their praise by any venal voice, Such as th'Ambitious vainly think their due, When Prostitutes, or needy Flatt'rers sue. And see the Chief! before him laurels born; Trophies from undeserving temples torn; Here Rage enchain'd reluctant raves, and there Pale Envy dumb, and sickning with despair, Prone to the earth she bends her loathing eye, Weak to support the blaze of majesty. But what are they that turn the sacred page? Three lovely Virgins, and of equal age; Intent they read, and all-enamour'd seem, As he that met his Likeness in the stream: The Graces these; and see how they contend, Who most shall praise, who best shall recommend? The Chariot now the painful steep ascends; The Pæans cease; thy glorious labour ends. Here fix'd, the bright eternal Temple stands, Its prospect an unbounded view commands: Say, wond'rous youth, what Column wilt thou chuse, What laurell'd Arch for thy triumphant Muse? Tho' each great Ancient court thee to his shrine, Tho' ev'ry Laurel thro' the dome be thine, (From the proud Epic, down to those that shade The gentler brow of the soft Lesbian maid) Go to the Good and Just, an awful train, Thy soul's delight, and glory of the Fane: While thro' the earth thy dear remembrance flies, “Sweet to the world, and grateful to the skies. SIMON HARCOURT. To Mr. Pope. From Rome, 1730. Immortal Bard! for whom each Muse has wove The fairest garlands of th'Aonian Grove; Preserv'd, our drooping Genius to restore, When Addison and Congreve are no more; After so many stars extinct in night, The darken'd Age's last remaining light! To thee from Latian realms this verse is writ, Inspir'd by memory of antient Wit; For now no more these climes their influence boast, Fall'n is their Glory, and their Virtue lost; From Tyrants, and from Priests, the Muses fly, Daughters of Reason and of Liberty. Nor Baiæ now, nor Umbria's plain they love, Nor on the banks of Nar, or Mincio rove; To Thames's flow'ry borders they retire, And kindle in thy breast the Roman fire. So in the shades, where chear'd with summer rays Melodious linnets warbled sprightly lays, Soon as the faded, falling leaves complain Of gloomy winter's unauspicious reign, No tuneful voice is heard of joy or love, But mournful silence saddens all the grove. Unhappy Italy! whose alter'd state Has felt the worst severity of Fate: Not that Barbarian hands her Fasces broke, And bow'd her haughty neck beneath their yoke; Not that her palaces to earth are thrown, Her cities desart, and her fields unsown; But that her ancient Spirit is decay'd, That sacred Wisdom from her bounds is fled, That there the source of Science flows no more, Whence its rich streams supply'd the world before. Illustrious Names! that once in Latium shin'd, Born to instruct, and to command Mankind; Chiefs, by whose Virtue mighty Rome was rais'd, And Poets, who those chiefs sublimely prais'd! Oft' I the traces you have left explore, Your ashes visit, and your urns adore; Oft' kiss, with lips devout, some mouldring stone, With ivy's venerable shade o'ergrown; Those hallow'd ruins better pleas'd to see, Than all the Pomp of modern Luxury. As late on Virgil's tomb fresh flow'rs I strow'd, While with th'inspiring Muse my bosom glow'd, Crown'd with eternal bays, my ravish'd eyes Beheld the Poet's awful Form arise; Stranger, he said, whose pious hand has paid These grateful rites to my attentive shade, When thou shalt breathe thy happy native air, To Pope this message from his Master bear: Great Bard, whose numbers I myself inspire, To whom I gave my own harmonious lyre, If high exalted on the Throne of Wit, Near Me and Homer thou aspire to sit, No more let meaner Satire dim the rays That flow majestic from thy nobler Bays; In all the flow'ry paths of Pindus stray, But shun that thorny, that unpleasing way; Nor when each soft engaging Muse is thine, Address the least attractive of the Nine. Of thee more worthy were the task, to raise A lasting Column to thy Country's Praise, To sing the Land, which yet, alone can boast That Liberty corrupted Rome has lost; Where Science in the arms of Peace is laid, And plants her Palm beneath the Olive's shade. Such was the Theme for which my lyre I strung, Such was the People whose exploits I sung; Brave, yet refin'd, for Arms and Arts renown'd, With different bays by Mars and Phœbus crown'd, Dauntless opposers of Tyrannic Sway, But pleas'd, a mild Augustus to obey. If these commands submissive thou receive, Immortal and unblam'd thy Name shall live, Envy to black Cocytus shall retire, And houl with Furies in tormenting fire; Approving Time shall consecrate thy Lays, And join the Patriot's to the Poet's Praise. GEORGE LYTTELTON. PASTORALS, WITH A Discourse on Pastoral. Written in the Year 1704. Remarks. These Pastorals were written at the age of sixteen, and then past thro' the hands of Mr. Walsh, Mr. Wycherley, G. Granville, afterwards Lord Lansdown, Sir William Trumbal, Dr. Garth, Lord Halifax, Lord Somers, Mr. Mainwaring, and others. Notwithstanding the early time of their production, the Author esteem'd these as the most correct in the versification, and musical in the numbers, of all his works. The reason for his labouring them into so much softness, was, that this sort of poetry derives almost its whole beauty from a natural ease of thought and smoothness of verse; whereas that of most other kinds consists in the Strength and fulness of both. In a Letter of his to Mr. Walsh about this time, we find an enumeration of several Niceties in Versification, which perhaps have never been strictly observ'd in any English poem, except in these Pastorals. They were not printed till 1709. Rura mihi &amp; rigui placeant in vallibus amnes, Flumina amem, sylvasque, inglorius! Virg. SPRING. THE FIRST PASTORAL. To Sir William Trumbal. Ver. 1. Prima Syracosio dignata est ludere versu, Nostra nec erubuit sylvas habitare Thalia. This is the general Exordium and opening of the Pastorals, in imitation of the 6th of Virgil, which some have therefore not improbably thought to have been the first originally. In the beginnings of the other three Pastorals, he imitates expressly those of the three chief Poets in this kind, Theocritus, Virgil, Spenser; A Shepherd's Boy (he seeks no better name)— Beneath the shade a spreading Beech displays,— Thyrsis, the Musick of that murm'ring Spring,— are manifestly imitations of A Shepherd's Boy (no better do him call)— Tityre, tu patulæ recubans sub tegmine fagi.— ????? ?? ????????? ??? ??????, ?????? ????.— First in these fields I try the sylvan strains, Nor blush to sport on Windsor's blissful plains: Fair Thames flow gently from thy sacred spring, While on thy banks Sicilian Muses sing; Let vernal airs thro' trembling osiers play, And Albion's cliffs resound the rural lay. You, that too wise for pride, too good for pow'r, Enjoy the glory to be great no more, And carrying with you all the world can boast, To all the world illustriously are lost! O let my Muse her slender reed inspire, Ver. 12. In your native shades.] Sir W. Trumbal was born in Windsor-Forest, to which he retreated after he had resign'd the post of Secretary of State to King William III.Till in your native shades you tune the lyre: So when the Nightingale to rest removes, The Thrush may chant to the forsaken groves, But, charm'd to silence, listens while she sings, And all th'aerial audience clap their wings. Ver. 17, &amp;c. The Scene of this Pastoral a Vally, the Time the Morning. It stood originally thus; Daphnis and Strephon to the shades retir'd, Both warm'd by Love, and by the Muse inspir'd; Fresh as the morn, and as the season fair, In flow'ry vales they fed their fleecy care; And while Aurora gilds the mountain's side, Thus Daphnis spoke, and Strephon thus reply'd.Soon as the flocks shook off the nightly dews, Two Swains, whom Love kept wakeful, and the Muse, Pour'd o'er the whitening vale their fleecy care, Fresh as the morn, and as the season fair: The dawn now blushing on the mountain's side, Thus Daphnis spoke, and Strephon thus reply'd. Daphnis. Hear how the birds, on ev'ry bloomy spray, With joyous music wake the dawning day! Why sit we mute when early linnets sing, When warbling Philomel salutes the spring? Why sit we sad when Phosphor shines so clear, And lavish nature paints the purple year? Strephon. Sing then, and Damon shall attend the strain, While yon' slow oxen turn the furrow'd plain. Here on green banks the blushing vi'lets glow; Here western winds on breathing roses blow. I'll stake yon' lamb, that near the fountain plays, Ver. 34. The first reading was, And his own Image from the bank surveys.And from the brink his dancing shade surveys. Daphnis. 35, 36. Lenta quibus torno facili superaddita vitis, Diffusos edera vestit pallenti corymbos. Virg.And I this bowl, where wanton ivy twines, Ver. 36. And clusters lurk beneath the curling vines.And swelling clusters bend the curling vines: Four figures rising from the work appear, 38. The various Seasons.] The Subject of these Pastorals engraven on the bowl is not without its propriety. The Shepherd's hesitation at the name of the Zodiac, imitates that in Virgil, ? Et quis fuit alter? Descripsit radio totam qui gentibus orbem.The various seasons of the rowling year; And what is that, which binds the radiant sky, Where twelve bright Signs in beauteous order lie? Damon. Ver. 41. Then sing by turns.] Literally from Virgil, Alternis dicetis, amant alterna Camœnæ: Et nunc omnis ager, nunc omnis parturit arbos, Nunc frondent sylvæ, nunc formosissimus annus.Then sing by turns, by turns the Muses sing, Now hawthorns blossom, now the daisies spring, Now leaves the trees, and flow'rs adorn the ground; Begin, the vales shall ev'ry note rebound. Strephon. Inspire me, Phœbus, in my Delia's praise Ver. 46. Granville—] George Granville, afterwards Lord Lansdown, known for his Poems, most of which he compos'd very young, and propos'd Waller as his model.With Waller's strains, or Granville's moving lays! Ver. 47. A milk-white bull.] Virg. ? Pascite taurum, Qui cornu petat, &amp; pedibus jam spargat arenam.A milk-white bull shall at your altars stand, That threats a fight, and spurns the rising sand. Daphnis. O Love! for Sylvia let me gain the prize, And make my tongue victorious as her eyes; No lambs or sheep for victims I'll impart, Thy victim, Love, shall be the shepherds heart. Strephon. Me gentle Delia beckons from the plain, Then hid in shades, eludes her eager swain; But feigns a laugh, to see me search around, And by that laugh the willing fair is found. Daphnis. The sprightly Sylvia trips along the green, Ver. 58. She runs, but hopes.] Imitation of Virgil, Malo me Galatea petit, lasciva puella, Et fugit ad salices, sed se cupit ante videri.She runs, but hopes she does not run unseen; While a kind glance at her pursuer flies, How much at variance are her feet and eyes! Strephon. Ver. 61. It stood thus at first, Let rich Iberia golden fleeces boast, Her purple wool the proud Assyrian coast, Blest Thames's shores, &amp;c.O'er golden sands let rich Pactolus flow, And trees weep amber on the banks of Po; Blest Thames's shores the brightest beauties yield, Feed here my lambs, I'll seek no distant field. Daphnis. Celestial Venus haunts Idalia's groves; Diana Cynthus, Ceres Hybla loves; If Windsor-shades delight the matchless maid, Cynthus and Hybla yield to Windsor-shade. Strephon. Ver. 69. All nature mourns.] Virg. Aret ager, vitio moriens sitit aëris herba, &amp;c. Phyllidis adventu nostræ nemus omne virebit ? Ver. 69, &amp;c. These verses were thus at first; All nature mourns, the birds their songs deny, Nor wasted brooks the thirsty flow'rs supply; If Delia smile, the flow'rs begin to spring, The brooks to murmur, and the birds to sing.All nature mourns, the skies relent in show'rs, Hush'd are the birds, and clos'd the drooping flow'rs; If Delia smile, the flow'rs begin to spring, The skies to brighten, and the birds to sing. Daphnis. All nature laughs, the groves are fresh and fair, The Sun's mild lustre warms the vital air; If Sylvia smiles, new glories gild the shore, And vanquish'd nature seems to charm no more. Strephon. In spring the fields, in autumn hills I love, At morn the plains, at noon the shady grove, But Delia always; absent from her sight, Nor plains at morn, nor groves at noon delight. Daphnis. Sylvia's like autumn ripe, yet mild as May, More bright than noon, yet fresh as early day; Ev'n spring displeases, when she shines not here; But blest with her, 'tis spring throughout the year. Strephon. Say, shepherd, say, in what glad soil appears Ver. 86. A wond'rous Tree that sacred Monarchs bears.] An allusion to the Royal Oak, in which Charles the second had been hid from the pursuit after the battle of Worcester.A wond'rous Tree that sacred Monarchs bears? Tell me but this, and I'll disclaim the prize, And give the conquest to thy Sylvia's eyes. Daphnis. Nay tell me first, in what more happy fields Ver. 90. The Thistle springs, to which the Lilly yields,] alludes to the Device of the Scots Monarchs, the Thistle, worn by Queen Anne; and to the Arms of France, the Fleur de Lys. The two Riddles are in imitation of those in Virg. Ecl. 3. Dic quibus in terris inscripti nomina Regum Nascuntur Flores, &amp; Phyllida solus habebis.The Thistle springs, to which the Lilly yields? And then a nobler prize I will resign; For Sylvia, charming Sylvia, shall be thine. Damon. Cease to contend, for (Daphnis) I decree The bowl to Strephon, and the lamb to thee: Blest Swains, whose nymphs in ev'ry grace excel, Blest Nymphs, whose swains those graces sing so well! Now rise and haste to yonder woodbine bow'rs, A soft retreat from sudden vernal show'rs; Ver. 99. was originally, The turf with country dainties shall be spread, And trees with twining branches shade your head.The turf with rural dainties shall be crown'd, While opening blooms diffuse their sweets around. For see! the gath'ring flocks to shelter tend, And from the Pleiads fruitful show'rs descend. SUMMER. THE SECOND PASTORAL. To Dr. Garth. A shepherd's Boy (he seeks no better name) Led forth his flocks along the silver Thame, Ver. 3. The Scene of this Pastoral by the River's side; suitable to the heat of the season; the Time, Noon.Where dancing sun-beams on the waters play'd, And verdant alders form'd a quiv'ring shade. Ver. 1, 2, 3, 4. were thus printed in the first edition; A faithfull swain, whom Love had taught to sing, Bewail'd his fate beside a silver spring; Where gentle Thames his winding waters leads, Thro' verdant forests, and thro' flow'ry meads. There while he mourn'd, the streams forgot to flow, The flocks around a dumb compassion show, The Naiads wept in ev'ry wat'ry bow'r, Ver. 8. And Jove consented.] Virg. Jupiter &amp; læto descendet plurimus imbri.And Jove consented in a silent show'r. Ver. 9.] Dr. Samuel Garth, Author of the Dispensary, was one of the first friends of the author, whose acquaintance with him began at fourteen or fifteen. Their friendship continu'd from the year 1703, to 1718, which was that of his death.Accept, O Garth, the Muse's early lays, That adds this wreath of Ivy to thy Bays; Hear what from Love unpractis'd hearts endure, From Love, the sole disease thou canst not cure. Ye shady beeches, and ye cooling streams, Defence from Phœbus, not from Cupid's beams, Ver. 15.—Nor to the deaf I sing—] Non canimus surdis, respondent omnia sylvæ. Virg.To you I mourn, nor to the deaf I sing, Ver. 16. The woods shall answer, and their echo ring, is a line out of Spenser's Epithalamion.The woods shall answer, and their echo ring. The hills and rocks attend my doleful lay, Why art thou prouder and more hard than they? The bleating sheep with my complaints agree, They parch'd with heat, and I enflam'd by thee. The sultry Sirius burns the thirsty plains, While in thy heart eternal winter reigns. Ver. 23. Where stray ye Muses, &amp;c.] Quæ nemora, aut qui vos saltus habuere, puellæ Naiades, indigno cum Gallus amore periret? Nam neque Parnassi vobis juga, nam neque Pindi Ulla moram fecere, neque Aonia Aganippe. Virg. out of Theoc.Where stray ye Muses, in what lawn or grove, While your Alexis pines in hopeless love? In those fair fields where sacred Isis glides, Or else where Cam his winding vales divides? Ver. 27. Oft in the crystal spring I cast a view, And equal'd Hylas, if the glass be true; But since those graces meet my eyes no more, I shun, &amp;c. Virgil again from the Cyclops of Theocritus, ? nuper me in littore vidi Cum placidum ventis staret mare, non ego Daphnim Judice te, metuam, si nunquam fallat imago.As in the crystal spring I view my face, Fresh rising blushes paint the wat'ry glass; But since those graces please thy eyes no more, I shun the fountains which I sought before. Once I was skill'd in ev'ry herb that grew, And ev'ry plant that drinks the morning dew; Ah wretched shepherd, what avails thy art, To cure thy lambs, but not to heal thy heart! Let other swains attend the rural care, Feed fairer flocks, or richer fleeces share: But nigh yon' mountain let me tune my lays, Embrace my Love, and bind my brows with bays. Ver. 39. Colin.] The name taken by Spenser in his Eclogues, where his mistress is celebrated under that of Rosalinda.That flute is mine which Colin's tuneful breath Ver. 40. Virg. Ecl. 2. Est mihi disparibus septem compacta cicutis Fistula, Damætas dono mihi quam dedit olim Et dixit moriens, Te nunc habet ista secundum.Inspir'd when living, and bequeath'd in death; He said; Alexis, take this pipe, the same That taught the groves my Rosalinda's name: But now the reeds shall hang on yonder tree, For ever silent, since despis'd by thee. Oh! were I made by some transforming pow'r The captive bird that sings within thy bow'r! Then might my voice thy listning ears employ, And I those kisses he receives, enjoy. And yet my numbers please the rural throng, Rough Satyrs dance, and Pan applauds the song: The Nymphs forsaking ev'ry cave and spring, Their early fruit, and milk-white turtles bring; Each am'rous nymph prefers her gifts in vain, On you their gifts are all bestow'd again. For you the swains the fairest flow'rs design, And in one garland all their beauties join; Accept the wreath which you deserve alone, In whom all beauties are compriz'd in one. See what delights in sylvan scenes appear! Ver. 60. Descending Gods have found Elyzium here.] ? Habitarunt Di quoque sylvas ? Virg. Et formosus oves ad flumina pavit Adonis. Idem.Descending Gods have found Elyzium here. In woods bright Venus with Adonis stray'd, And chaste Diana haunts the forest-shade. Come, lovely nymph, and bless the silent hours, When swains from sheering seek their nightly bow'rs; When weary reapers quit the sultry field, And crown'd with corn, their thanks to Ceres yield. This harmless grove no lurking viper hides, But in my breast the serpent Love abides. Here bees from blossoms sip the rosy dew, But your Alexis knows no sweet but you. Oh deign to visit our forsaken seats, The mossy fountains, and the green retreats! Where-e'er you walk, cool gales shall fan the glade, Trees, where you sit, shall croud into a shade; Where-e'er you tread, the blushing flow'rs shall rise, And all things flourish where you turn your eyes. Oh! how I long with you to pass my days, Invoke the Muses, and resound your praise! Ver. 79, 80. Your praise the tuneful birds to heav'n shall bear, And list'ning wolves grow milder as they hear.Your praise the birds shall chant in ev'ry grove, Ver. 80. And winds shall waft—] Partem aliquam, venti, divúm referatis ad aures! Virg.And winds shall waft it to the pow'rs above. But would you sing, and rival Orpheus' strain, The wond'ring forests soon should dance again, The moving mountains hear the pow'rful call, And headlong streams hang list'ning in their fall! But see, the shepherds shun the noon-day heat, The lowing herds to murm'ring brooks retreat, To closer shades the panting flocks remove; Ver. 88. Me tamen urit amor, quis enim modus adsit amori? Id.Ye Gods! and is there no relief for Love? But soon the sun with milder rays descends To the cool ocean, where his journey ends: Ver. 91. Me love inflames, nor will his fires allay.On me love's fiercer flames for ever prey, By night he scorches, as he burns by day. AUTUMN. THE THIRD PASTORAL. To Mr. Wycherley. This Pastoral consists of two parts, like the 8th of Virgil: The Scene, a Hill; the Time, at Sun-set. Beneath the shade a spreading Beech displays, Hylas and Ægon sung their rural lays, This mourn'd a faithless, that an absent Love, And Delia's name and Doris fill'd the Grove. Ye Mantuan nymphs, your sacred succour bring; Hylas and Ægon's rural lays I sing. Thou, whom the Nine with Plautus' wit inspire, The art of Terence, and Menander's fire; Whose sense instructs us, and whose humour charms, Whose judgment sways us, and whose spirit warms! Oh, skill'd in Nature! see the hearts of Swains, Their artless passions, and their tender pains. Now setting Phœbus shone serenely bright, And fleecy clouds were streak'd with purple light; When tuneful Hylas with melodious moan Taught rocks to weep, and made the mountains groan. Go, gentle gales, and bear my sighs away! To Delia's ear the tender notes convey. As some sad Turtle his lost love deplores, And with deep murmurs fills the sounding shores; Thus, far from Delia, to the winds I mourn, Alike unheard, unpity'd, and forlorn. Go, gentle gales, and bear my sighs along! For her, the feather'd quires neglect their song; For her, the lymes their pleasing shades deny; For her, the lillies hang their heads and die. Ye flow'rs that droop, forsaken by the spring, Ye birds, that left by summer, cease to sing, Ye trees that fade when autumn-heats remove, Say, is not absence death to those who love? Go, gentle gales, and bear my sighs away! Curs'd be the fields that cause my Delia's stay; Fade ev'ry blossom, wither ev'ry tree, Die ev'ry flow'r, and perish all, but she. What have I said? where'er my Delia flies, Let spring attend, and sudden flow'rs arise; Ver. 37. ? Aurea duræ Mala ferent quercus, narcisso floreat alnus, Pinguia corticibus sudant electra myricæ. Virg. Ecl. 8.Let opening roses knotted oaks adorn, And liquid amber drop from ev'ry thorn. Go, gentle gales, and bear my sighs along! The birds shall cease to tune their ev'ning song, The winds to breathe, the waving woods to move, And streams to murmur, e'er I cease to love. Ver. 43, &amp;c.] Quale sopor fessis in gramine, quale per æstum Dulcis aqua saliente sitim restinguere rivo. Ecl. 5.Not bubling fountains to the thirsty swain, Not balmy sleep to lab'rers faint with pain, Not show'rs to larks, or sunshine to the bee, Are half so charming, as thy sight to me. Go, gentle gales, and bear my sighs away! Come, Delia, come; ah, why this long delay? Thro' rocks and caves the name of Delia sounds, Delia, each cave and echoing rock rebounds. Ye pow'rs, what pleasing frenzy sooths my mind! Ver. 52. —An qui amant, ipsi sibi somnia fingunt? Id. 8.Do lovers dream, or is my Delia kind? She comes, my Delia comes!—Now cease my lay, And cease, ye gales, to bear my sighs away! Next Ægon sung, while Windsor groves admir'd, Rehearse, ye Muses, what yourselves inspir'd. Resound, ye hills, resound my mournful strain! Of perjur'd Doris, dying I complain: Here where the mountains less'ning as they rise Lose the low vales, and steal into the skies: While lab'ring oxen, spent with toil and heat, In their loose traces from the field retreat: While curling smoaks from village-tops are seen, Ver. 64. And the fleet shades fly gliding o'er the green.And the fleet shades glide o'er the dusky green. Resound, ye hills, resound my mournful lay! Beneath yon' poplar oft we past the day: Oft' on the rind I carv'd her am'rous vows, While she with garlands hung the bending boughs: The garlands fade, the vows are worn away; So dies her love, and so my hopes decay. Resound, ye hills, resound my mournful strain! Now bright Arcturus glads the teeming grain, Now golden fruits on loaded branches shine, And grateful clusters swell with floods of wine; Now blushing berries paint the yellow grove; Just Gods! shall all things yield returns but love? Resound, ye hills, resound my mournful lay! The shepherds cry, “Thy flocks are left a prey— Ah! what avails it me, the flocks to keep, Who lost my heart while I preserv'd my sheep. Pan came, and ask'd, what magic caus'd my smart, Ver. 82. Or what ill eyes.] Nescio quis teneros oculus mihi fascinat agnos.Or what ill eyes malignant glances dart? Ver. 83. What eyes but hers, alas, have pow'er on me! Oh mighty Love! what magic is like thee!What eyes but hers, alas, have pow'r to move! And is there magic but what dwells in love? Resound, ye hills, resound my mournful strains! I'll fly from shepherds, flocks, and flow'ry plains.— From shepherds, flocks, and plains, I may remove, Forsake mankind, and all the world—but love! Ver. 89. Nunc scio quid sit amor, duris in cotibus illum, &amp;c.I know thee, Love! wild as the raging main, More fell than tygers on the Lybian plain: Thou wert from Ætna's burning entrails torn, Got by fierce whirlwinds, and in thunder born! Resound, ye hills, resound my mournful lay! Farewell, ye woods! adieu the light of day! One leap from yonder cliff shall end my pains. No more, ye hills, no more resound my strains! Thus sung the shepherds till th'approach of night, The skies yet blushing with departing light, When falling dews with spangles deck'd the glade, And the low sun had lengthen'd ev'ry shade. WINTER. THE FOURTH PASTORAL. To the Memory of Mrs. This Lady was particularly admired by the Author's friend Mr. Walsh, who having celebrated her in a Pastoral Elegy, desired his friend to do the same. Her death happening on the night of the great storm in 1702, gave a propriety to this eclogue, which in its general turn alludes to it. The Scene of this Pastoral lies in a grove, the Time at midnight. Tempest. Lycidas. Thyrsis, the music of that murm'ring spring, Is not so mournful as the strains you sing. Nor rivers winding thro' the vales below, So sweetly warble, or so smoothly flow. Ver. 5, 6. In the warm folds the tender flocks remain, The cattle slumber on the silent plain, While silent birds neglect their tuneful lays, Let us, dear Thyrsis, sing of Daphne's praise.Now sleeping flocks on their soft fleeces lie, The moon, serene in glory, mounts the sky, While silent birds forget their tuneful lays, Oh sing of Daphne's fate, and Daphne's praise! Thyrsis. Behold the groves that shine with silver frost, Their beauty wither'd, and their verdure lost. Here shall I try the sweet Alexis' strain, That call'd the list'ning Dryads to the plain? Ver. 13. Thames heard.] Audiit Eurotas, jussitque ediscere lauros. Virg. Thames heard the numbers as he flow'd along, And bade his willows learn the moving song. Lycidas. So may kind rains their vital moisture yield, And swell the future harvest of thy field. Begin; this charge the dying Daphne gave, And said; “Ye shepherds, sing around my grave! Sing, while beside the shaded tomb I mourn, And with fresh bays her rural shrine adorn. Thyrsis. Ye gentle Muses leave your crystal spring, Let Nymphs and Sylvans cypress garlands bring; Ver. 23, 24, 25. ? Inducite fontibus umbras ? Et tumulum facite, &amp; tumulo superaddite carmen.Ye weeping Loves, the stream with myrtles hide, And break your bows, as when Adonis dy'd; And with your golden darts, now useless grown, Inscribe a verse on this relenting stone: “Let nature change, let heav'n and earth deplore, “Fair Daphne's dead, and love is now no more! 'Tis done, and nature's various charms decay; See gloomy clouds obscure the chearful day! Now hung with pearls the dropping trees appear, Their faded honours scatter'd on her bier. See, where on earth the flow'ry glories lie, With her they flourish'd, and with her they die. Ah what avail the beauties nature wore? Fair Daphne's dead, and beauty is no more! For her, the flocks refuse their verdant food, Ver. 38. For her the flocks the dewy herbs disdain, Nor hungry heifers graze the tender plain.Nor thirsty heifers seek the gliding flood. The silver swans her hapless fate bemoan, In notes more sad than when they sing their own; In hollow caves sweet Echo silent lies, Silent, or only to her name replies, Her name with pleasure once she taught the shore, Now Daphne's dead, and pleasure is no more! No grateful dews descend from ev'ning skies, Nor morning odours from the flow'rs arise; No rich perfumes refresh the fruitful field, Nor fragrant herbs their native incense yield. The balmy Zephyrs, silent since her death, Lament the ceasing of a sweeter breath; Th'industrious bees neglect their golden store; Fair Daphne's dead, and sweetness is no more! No more the mounting larks, while Daphne sings, Shall list'ning in mid air suspend their wings; No more the nightingales repeat her lays, Or hush'd with wonder, hearken from the sprays: No more the streams their murmurs shall forbear, A sweeter music than their own to hear, But tell the reeds, and tell the vocal shore, Fair Daphne's dead, and music is no more! Her fate is whisper'd by the gentle breeze, And told in sighs to all the trembling trees; The trembling trees, in ev'ry plain and wood, Her fate remurmur to the silver flood; The silver flood, so lately calm, appears Swell'd with new passion, and o'erflows with tears; The winds and trees and floods her death deplore, Daphne, our grief! our glory now no more! Ver. 69, 70. ? miratur limen Olympi, Sub pedibusque vidit nubes &amp; sydera Daphnis.But see! where Daphne wond'ring mounts on high, Above the clouds, above the starry sky! Eternal beauties grace the shining scene, Fields ever fresh, and groves for ever green! There while you rest in Amaranthine bow'rs, Or from those meads select unfading flow'rs, Behold us kindly who your name implore, Daphne, our Goddess, and our grief no more! Lycidas. How all things listen, while thy Muse complains! Such silence waits on Philomela's strains, In some still ev'ning, when the whisp'ring breeze Pants on the leaves, and dies upon the trees. Ver. 81. ? illius aram Sæpe tener nostris ab ovilibus imbuet agnus. Virg.To thee, bright goddess, oft' a lamb shall bleed, If teeming ewes encrease my fleecy breed. While plants their shade, or flow'rs their odours give, Thy name, thy honour, and thy praise shall live! Thyrsis. See pale Orion sheds unwholesome dews, Ver. 86. ? solet esse gravis cantantibus umbra, Juniperi gravis umbra, ? Virg.Arise, the pines a noxious shade diffuse; Sharp Boreas blows, and Nature feels decay, Time conquers all, and we must Time obey. Ver. 89, &amp;c.] These four last lines allude to the several Subjects of the four Pastorals, and to the several Scenes of them, particularized before in each.Adieu ye vales, ye mountains, streams and groves, Adieu ye shepherd's rural lays and loves; Adieu my flocks, farewell ye sylvan crew, Daphne farewell, and all the world adieu! MESSIAH. A Sacred Eclogue, In imitation of VIRGIL's POLLIO. ADVERTISEMENT. In reading several passages of the Prophet Isaiah, which foretell the coming of Christ and the felicities attending it, I could not but observe a remarkable parity between many of the thoughts, and those in the Pollio of Virgil. This will not seem surprizing, when we reflect, that the Eclogue was taken from a Sibylline prophecy on the same subject. One may judge that Virgil did not copy it line by line, but selected such ideas as best agreed with the nature of pastoral poetry, and disposed them in that manner which serv'd most to beautify his piece. I have endeavour'd the same in this imitation of him, tho' without admitting any thing of my own; since it was written with this particular view, that the reader by comparing the several thoughts, might see how far the images and descriptions of the Prophet are superior to those of the Poet. But as I fear I have prejudiced them by my management, I shall subjoin the passages of Isaiah, and those of Virgil, under the same disadvantage of a literal translation. Ye Nymphs of Solyma! begin the song: To heav'nly themes sublimer strains belong. The mossy fountains, and the sylvan shades, The dreams of Pindus and th'Aonian maids, Delight no more—O thou my voice inspire Who touch'd Isaiah's hallow'd lips with fire! Rapt into future times, the Bard begun, Ver. 8. A Virgin shall conceive—All crimes shall cease, &amp;c.] Virg. E. 4. v. 6. Jam redit &amp; Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna, Jam nova progenies cælo demittitur alto ? Te duce, si qua manent sceleris vestigia nostri. Irrita perpetua solvent formidine terras— Pacatumque reget patriis virtutibus orbem. Now the Virgin returns, now the kingdom of Saturn returns, now a new Progeny is sent down from high heaven. By means of thee, whatever reliques of our crimes remain, shall be wiped away, and free the world from perpetual fears. He shall govern the earth in peace, with the virtues of his Father. Isaiah, Ch. 7. v. 14. Behold a Virgin shall conceive, and bear a Son— Ch. 9. v. 6, 7. Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; the Prince of Peace: of the increase of his government, and of his peace, there shall be no end: Upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order and to stablish it, with judgment, and with justice, for ever and ever.A Virgin shall conceive, a Virgin bear a Son! From Isaiah, ch. 11. v. 1. Jesse's root behold a branch arise, Whose sacred flow'r with fragrance fills the skies: Th'Æthereal spirit o'er its leaves shall move, And on its top descends the mystic Dove. Ye Ch. 45. v. 8. heav'ns! from high the dewy nectar pour, And in soft silence shed the kindly show'r! The Ch. 25. v. 4. sick and weak the healing plant shall aid, From storms a shelter, and from heat a shade. All crimes shall cease, and ancient fraud shall fail; Returning Ch. 9. v. 7. Justice lift aloft her scale; Peace o'er the world her olive wand extend, And white-rob'd Innocence from heav'n descend. Swift fly the years, and rise th'expected morn! Oh spring to light, auspicious Babe, be born! Ver. 23. See Nature hastes, &amp;c.] Virg. E. 4. v. 18. At tibi prima, puer, nullo munuscula cultu, Errantes hederas passim cum baccare tellus, Mixtaque ridenti colocasia fundet acantho ? Ipsa tibi blandos fundent cunabula flores. For thee, O Child, shall the earth, without being tilled, produce her early offerings; winding ivy mixed with Baccar, and Colocasia with smiling Acanthus. Thy cradle shall pour forth pleasing flowers about thee. Isaiah, Ch. 35. v. 1. The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad, and the desart shall rejoice and blossom as the rose. Ch. 60. v. 13. The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir-tree, the pine-tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of thy Sanctuary.See Nature hastes her earliest wreaths to bring, With all the incense of the breathing spring: See lofty Ch. 35. v. 2. Lebanon his head advance, See nodding forests on the mountains dance; See spicy clouds from lowly Saron rise, And Carmel's flow'ry top perfumes the skies! Ver. 29. Hark! a glad voice, &amp;c.] Virg. E. 4. v. 46. Aggredere ô magnos, aderit jam tempus, honores, Cara deûm soboles, magnum Jovis incrementum— Ipsi latitia voces ad sydera jactant Intonsi montes, ipsæ jam carmina rupes, Ipsa sonant arbusta, Deus, deus ille Menalca! E. 5. v. 62. Oh come and receive the mighty honours: the time draws nigh, O beloved offspring of the Gods, O great encrease of Jove! The uncultivated mountains send shouts of joy to the stars, the very rocks sing in verse, the very shrubs cry out, A God, a God! Isaiah, Ch. 40. v. 3, 4. The voice of him that crieth the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord! make strait in the desart a high way for our God! Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall be made strait, and the rough places plain. Ch. 4. v. 23. Break forth into singing, ye mountains! O forest, and every tree therein! for the Lord hath redeemed Israel.Hark! a glad voice the lonely desart chears; Prepare the Ch. 40. v. 3, 4. way! a God, a God appears: A God; a God! the vocal hills reply, The rocks proclaim th'approaching Deity. Lo, earth receives him from the bending skies! Sink down ye mountains, and ye valleys rise, With heads declin'd, ye cedars, homage pay; Be smooth ye rocks, ye rapid floods give way! The Saviour comes! by ancient bards foretold; Hear Ch. 42. v. 18. Ch. 35. v. 5, 6. him, ye deaf, and all ye blind, behold! He from thick films shall purge the visual ray, And on the sightless eye ball pour the day: 'Tis he th'obstructed paths of sound shall clear, And bid new music charm th'unfolding ear: The dumb shall sing, the lame his crutch forego, And leap exulting like the bounding roe. No sigh, no murmur the wide world shall hear, From ev'ry face he wipes off ev'ry tear, In Ch. 25. v. 8. adamantine chains shall Death be bound, And Hell's grim Tyrant feel th'eternal wound. As the good Ch. 40 v. 11. shepherd tends his fleecy care, Seeks freshest pasture and the purest air, Explores the lost, the wand'ring sheep directs, By day o'ersees them, and by night protects, The tender lambs he raises in his arms, Feeds from his hand, and in his bosom warms; Thus shall mankind his guardian care engage, The promis'd Ch. 9. v. 6. father of the future age. No more shall Ch. 2. v. 4. nation against nation rise, Nor ardent warriors meet with hateful eyes, Nor fields with gleaming steel be cover'd o'er, The brazen trumpets kindle rage no more; But useless lances into scythes shall bend, And the broad faulchion in a plow-share end. Then palaces shall rise; the joyful Ch. 65. v. 21, 22. Son Shall finish what his short-liv'd Sire begun; Their vines a shadow to their race shall yield, And the same hand that sow'd, shall reap the field. Ver. 67. The swain in barren desarts, &amp;c.] Virg. E. 4. v. 28. Molli paulatim flavescit campus arista, Incultisque rubens pendebit sentibus uva, Et duræ quercus sudabunt roscida mella. The field shall grow yellow with ripen'd ears, and the red grape shall hang upon the wild brambles, and the hard oaks shall distill honey like dew. Isaiah, Ch. 35. v. 7. The parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: In the habitations where dragons lay, shall be grass, and reeds, and rushes. Ch. 55. v. 13. Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir-tree, and instead of the briar shall come up the myrtle-tree.The swain in barren Ch. 35. v. 1, 7. desarts with surprize See lillies spring, and sudden verdure rise; And starts, amidst the thirsty wilds to hear New falls of water murm'ring in his ear. On rifted rocks, the dragon's late abodes, The green reed trembles, and the bulrush nods. Waste sandy Ch. 41. v. 19. and Ch. 55. v. 13. valleys, once perplex'd with thorn, The spiry fir and shapely box adorn; To leafless shrubs the flow'ring palms succeed, And od'rous myrtle to the noisom weed. Ver. 77. The lambs with wolves, &amp;c.] Virg. E. 4. v. 21.Ipsæ lacte domum referent distenta capellæ Ubera, nec magnos metuent armenta leones— Occidet &amp; serpens, &amp; fallax herba veneni Occidet. ? The goats shall bear to the fold their udders distended with milk: nor shall the herds be afraid of the greatest lions. The serpent shall die, and the herb that conceals poison shall die. Isaiah, Ch. 11. v. 16, &amp;c. The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them—And the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the den of the cockatrice. The Ch. 11. v. 6, 7, 8. lambs with wolves shall graze the verdant mead, And boys in flow'ry bands the tyger lead; The steer and lion at one crib shall meet, And harmless Ch. 65. v. 25. serpents lick the pilgrim's feet. The smiling infant in his hand shall take The crested basilisk and speckled snake, Pleas'd the green lustre of the scales survey, And with their forky tongue shall innocently play. Ver. 85. Rise crown'd with light, &amp;c.] The thoughts of Isaiah, which compose the latter part of the poem, are wonderfully elevated, and much above those general exclamations of Virgil, which make the loftiest parts of his Pollio. Magnus ab integro sæclorum nascitur ordo! ? toto surget gens aurea mundo! ? incipient magni procedere menses! Aspice, venturo lætentur ut omnia sæclo! &amp;c. The reader needs only turn to the passages of Isaiah, here cited.Rise, crown'd with light, imperial Ch. 60. v. 1. Salem rise! Exalt thy tow'ry head, and lift thy eyes! See, a long Ch. 60. v. 4. race thy spacious courts adorn; See future sons, and daughters yet unborn, In crouding ranks on ev'ry side arise, Demanding life, impatient for the skies! See barb'rous Ch. 60. v. 3. nations at thy gates attend, Walk in thy light, and in thy temple bend; See thy bright altars throng'd with prostrate kings, And heap'd with products of Ch. 60. v. 6. Sabæan springs! For thee Idume's spicy forests blow, And seeds of gold in Ophyr's mountains glow. See heav'n its sparkling portals wide display, And break upon thee in a flood of day! No more the rising Ch. 60. v. 19, 20. Sun shall gild the morn, Nor ev'ning Cynthia fill her silver horn, But lost, dissolv'd in thy superior rays, One tyde of glory, one unclouded blaze O'erflow thy courts: The Light himself shall shine Reveal'd, and God's eternal day be thine! The Ch. 51. v. 6. and Ch. 54. v. 10. seas shall waste, the skies in smoke decay, Rocks fall to dust, and mountains melt away; But fix'd his word, his saving pow'r remains; Thy realm for ever lasts, thy own Messiah reigns! WINDSOR-FOREST. To the Right Honourable GEORGE Lord Lansdown. This Poem was written at two different times: the first part of it which relates to the country, in the year 1704, at the same time with the Pastorals: the latter part was not added till the year 1710, in which it was publish'd. Non injussa cano: Te nostræ Vare myricæ Te Nemus omne canet; nec Phœbo gratior ulla est Quam sibi quæ Vari præscripsit pagina nomen. Virg. Thy forests, Windsor! and thy green retreats, At once the Monarch's and the Muse's seats, Ver. 3, &amp;c. originally thus, ? Chaste Goddess of the woods, Nymphs of the vales, and Naiads of the floods, Lead me thro' arching bow'rs, and glimm'ring glades.Invite my lays. Be present, sylvan maids! Unlock your springs, and open all your shades. Granville commands; your aid O Muses bring! What Muse for Granville can refuse to sing? The groves of Eden, vanish'd now so long, Live in description, and look green in song: These, were my breast inspir'd with equal flame, Like them in beauty, should be like in fame. Here hills and vales, the woodland and the plain, Here earth and water, seem to strive again; Not Chaos like together crush'd and bruis'd, But as the world, harmoniously confus'd: Where order in variety we see, And where, tho' all things differ, all agree. Here waving groves a checquer'd scene display, And part admit, and part exclude the day; As some coy nymph her lover's warm address Nor quite indulges, nor can quite repress. There, interspers'd in lawns and opening glades, Thin trees arise that shun each other's shades. Here in full light the russet plains extend; There wrapt in clouds the blueish hills ascend. Ver. 25. Why should I sing our better suns or air, Whose vital draughts prevent the leach's care, While thro' fresh fields th'enliv'ning odours breathe, Or spread with vernal blooms the purple heath.Ev'n the wild heath displays her purple dyes, And 'midst the desart fruitful fields arise, That crown'd with tufted trees and springing corn, Like verdant isles the sable waste adorn. Let India boast her plants, nor envy we The weeping amber or the balmy tree, While by our oaks the precious loads are born, And realms commanded which those trees adorn. Not proud Olympus yields a nobler sight, Tho' Gods assembled grace his tow'ring height, Than what more humble mountains offer here, Where, in their blessings, all those Gods appear. See Pan with flocks, with fruits Pomona crown'd, Here blushing Flora paints th'enamel'd ground, Here Ceres' gifts in waving prospect stand, And nodding tempt the joyful reaper's hand; Rich Industry sits smiling on the plains, And peace and plenty tell, a Stuart reigns. Not thus the land appear'd in ages past, A dreary desart and a gloomy waste, To savage beasts and The Forest Laws. savage laws a prey, And kings more furious and severe than they; Who claim'd the skies, dispeopled air and floods, The lonely lords of empty wilds and woods: Cities laid waste, they storm'd the dens and caves, (For wiser brutes were backward to be slaves.) What could be free, when lawless beasts obey'd, And ev'n the elements a Tyrant sway'd? In vain kind seasons swell'd the teeming grain, Soft show'rs distill'd, and suns grew warm in vain; The swain with tears his frustrate labour yields, And famish'd dies amidst his ripen'd fields. Ver. 57, &amp;c. No wonder savages or subjects slain— But subjects starv'd while savages were fed. It was originally thus, but the word Savages is not so properly apply'd to beasts as to men; which occasion'd the alteration.What wonder then, a beast or subject slain Were equal crimes in a despotick reign? Both doom'd alike, for sportive Tyrants bled, But that the subject starv'd, the beast was fed. Proud Nimrod first the bloody chace began, A mighty hunter, and his prey was man: Our haughty Norman boasts that barb'rous name, And makes his trembling slaves the royal game. The Alluding to the new forest, and the tyrannies exercis'd there by William the first. fields are ravish'd from th'industrious swains, From men their cities, and from Gods their fanes: The levell'd towns with weeds lie cover'd o'er; The hollow winds thro' naked temples roar; Round broken columns clasping ivy twin'd; O'er heaps of ruin stalk'd the stately hind; The fox obscene to gaping tombs retires, Ver. 72. And wolves with howling fill, &amp;c.] The Author thought this an error, wolves not being common in England at the time of the Conqueror.And savage howlings fill the sacred quires. Aw'd by his Nobles, by his Commons curst, Th'Oppressor rul'd tyrannic where he durst, Stretch'd o'er the Poor and Church his iron rod, And serv'd alike his Vassals and his God. Whom ev'n the Saxon spar'd, and bloody Dane, The wanton victims of his sport remain. But see, the man who spacious regions gave A waste for beasts, himself deny'd a grave! Stretch'd on the lawn, his Richard, second son of William the Conqueror. second hope survey, At once the chaser, and at once the prey: Lo Rufus, tugging at the deadly dart, Bleeds in the forest, like a wounded hart. Succeeding Monarchs heard the subjects cries, Nor saw displeas'd the peaceful cottage rise. Then gath'ring flocks on unknown mountains fed, O'er sandy wilds were yellow harvests spread, The forests wonder'd at th'unusual grain, And secret transport touch'd the conscious swain. Ver. 91. Oh may no more a foreign master's rage With wrongs yet legal, curse a future age! Still spread, fair Liberty! thy heav'nly wings, Breath plenty on the fields, and fragrance on the springs.Fair Liberty, Britannia's Goddess, rears Her chearful head, and leads the golden years. Ye vig'rous swains! while youth ferments your blood, And purer spirits swell the sprightly flood, Now range the hills, the thickest woods beset, Wind the shrill horn, or spread the waving net. Ver. 97. When yellow autumn summer's heat succeeds, And into wine the purple harvest bleeds, The partridge feeding in the new-shorn fields Both morning sports and ev'ning pleasures yields.When milder autumn summer's heat succeeds, And in the new-shorn field the partridge feeds, Before his lord the ready spaniel bounds, Panting with hope, he tries the furrow'd grounds; But when the tainted gales the game betray, Couch'd close he lies, and meditates the prey: Secure they trust th'unfaithful field, beset, Till hov'ring o'er 'em sweeps the swelling net. Thus (if small things we may with great compare) When Albion sends her eager sons to war, Some thoughtless Town, with ease and plenty blest, Near, and more near, the closing lines invest; Sudden they seize th'amaz'd, defenceless prize, And high in air Britannia's standard flies. See! from the brake the whirring pheasant springs, And mounts exulting on triumphant wings: Short is his joy; he feels the fiery wound, Flutters in blood, and panting beats the ground. Ah! what avail his glossy, varying dyes, His purple crest, and scarlet-circled eyes, The vivid green his shining plumes unfold, His painted wings, and breast that flames with gold? Ver. 119. When hoary winter cloaths the year in white, The woods and fields to pleasing toils invite.Nor yet, when moist Arcturus clouds the sky, The woods and fields their pleasing toils deny. To plains with well-breath'd beagles we repair, And trace the mazes of the circling hare: (Beasts, urg'd by us, their fellow-beasts pursue, And learn of man each other to undo.) With slaught'ring guns th'unweary'd fowler roves, When frosts have whiten'd all the naked groves; Where doves in flocks the leafless trees o'ershade, And lonely woodcocks haunt the wat'ry glade. Ver. 129. The fowler lifts his level'd tube on high.He lifts the tube, and levels with his eye; Strait a short thunder breaks the frozen sky: Oft', as in airy rings they skim the heath, The clam'rous plovers feel the leaden death: Oft', as the mounting larks their notes prepare, They fall, and leave their little lives in air. In genial spring, beneath the quiv'ring shade, Where cooling vapours breathe along the mead, The patient fisher takes his silent stand, Intent, his angle trembling in his hand; With looks unmov'd, he hopes the scaly breed, And eyes the dancing cork, and bending reed. Our plenteous streams a various race supply, The bright-ey'd perch with fins of Tyrian dye, The silver eel, in shining volumes roll'd, The yellow carp, in scales bedrop'd with gold, Swift trouts, diversify'd with crimson stains, And pykes, the tyrants of the watry plains. Ver. 147. But when bright Phœbus from the twins invites Our active genius to more free delights, With springing day we range the lawns around.Now Cancer glows with Phœbus' fiery car; The youth rush eager to the sylvan war, Swarm o'er the lawns, the forest walks surround, Rouze the fleet hart, and chear the opening hound. Th'impatient courser pants in ev'ry vein, And pawing, seems to beat the distant plain; Hills, vales, and floods appear already cross'd, And e'er he starts, a thousand steps are lost. See! the bold youth strain up the threat'ning steep, Rush thro' the thickets, down the valleys sweep, Hang o'er their coursers heads with eager speed, And earth rolls back beneath the flying steed. Let old Arcadia boast her ample plain, Th'immortal huntress, and her virgin-train; Nor envy, Windsor! since thy shades have seen As bright a Goddess, and as chaste a Queen; Whose care, like hers, protects the sylvan reign, The Earth's fair light, and Empress of the main. Ver. 165. Yet here, 'tis sung, of old Diana stray'd: And Cynthus' top forsook for Windsor-shade. Here was she seen o'er sunny heaths to rove, Seek the clear spring, or haunt the pathless grove.Here, as old bards have sung, Diana stray'd, Bath'd in the springs, or sought the cooling shade; Here arm'd with silver bows, in early dawn, Her buskin'd Virgins trac'd the dewy lawn. Above the rest a rural nymph was fam'd, Thy offspring, Thames! the fair Lodona nam'd; (Lodona's fate, in long oblivion cast, The Muse shall sing, and what she sings shall last.) Scarce could the Goddess from her nymph be known, But by the crescent and the golden zone. She scorn'd the praise of beauty, and the care, A belt her waist, a fillet binds her hair, A painted quiver on her shoulder sounds, And with her dart the flying deer she wounds. It chanc'd, as eager of the chace, the maid Beyond the forest's verdant limits stray'd, Pan saw and lov'd, and burning with desire Pursu'd her flight, her flight increas'd his fire. Not half so swift the trembling doves can fly, When the fierce eagle cleaves the liquid sky; Not half so swiftly the fierce eagle moves, When thro' the clouds he drives the trembling doves; As from the God she flew with furious pace, Or as the God, more furious, urg'd the chace. Now fainting, sinking, pale, the nymph appears; Now close behind, his sounding steps she hears; And now his shadow reach'd her as she run, His shadow lengthen'd by the setting sun; And now his shorter breath, with sultry air, Pants on her neck, and fans her parting hair. In vain on father Thames she call'd for aid, Nor could Diana help her injur'd maid. Faint, breathless, thus she pray'd, nor pray'd in vain; “Ah Cynthia! ah—tho' banish'd from thy train, “Let me, O let me, to the shades repair, “My native shades—there weep, and murmur there. She said, and melting as in tears she lay, In a soft, silver stream dissolv'd away. The silver stream her virgin coldness keeps, For ever murmurs, and for ever weeps; Still bears the The river Loddon. name the hapless virgin bore, And bathes the forest where she rang'd before. In her chaste current oft' the Goddess laves, And with celestial tears augments the waves. Oft' in her glass the musing shepherd spies The headlong mountains and the downward skies, The watry landskip of the pendant woods, And absent trees that tremble in the floods; In the clear azure gleam the flocks are seen, And floating forests paint the waves with green. Thro' the fair scene rowl slow the ling'ring streams, Then foaming pour along, and rush into the Thames. Thou too, great father of the British floods! With joyful pride survey'st our lofty woods; Where tow'ring oaks their spreading honours rear, And future navies on thy shores appear. Not Neptune's self from all his streams receives A wealthier tribute, than to thine he gives. No seas so rich, so gay no banks appear, No lake so gentle, and no spring so clear. Not fabled Po more swells the poet's lays, While thro' the skies his shining current strays, Than thine, which visits Windsor's fam'd abodes, To grace the mansion of our earthly Gods: Nor all his stars a brighter lustre show, Than the fair nymphs that grace thy side below: Here Jove himself, subdu'd by beauty still, Might change Olympus for a nobler hill. Ver. 233. Happy the man who to the shades retires, But doubly happy, if the Muse inspires! Blest whom the sweets of home-felt quiet please; But far more blest, who study joins with ease.Happy the man whom this bright Court approves, His Sov'reign favours, and his Country loves: Happy next him, who to these shades retires, Whom Nature charms, and whom the Muse inspires; Whom humbler joys of home-felt quiet please, Successive study, exercise, and ease. He gathers health from herbs the forest yields, And of their fragrant physic spoils the fields: With chymic art exalts the min'ral pow'rs, And draws the aromatic souls of flow'rs: Now marks the course of rolling orbs on high; O'er figur'd worlds now travels with his eye: Of ancient writ unlocks the learned store, Consults the dead, and lives past ages o'er: Or wand'ring thoughtful in the silent wood, Attends the duties of the wise and good, T'observe a mean, be to himself a friend, To follow nature, and regard his end; Or looks on heav'n with more than mortal eyes, Bids his free soul expatiate in the skies, Amid her kindred stars familiar roam, Survey the region, and confess her home! Such was the life great Scipio once admir'd, Thus Atticus, and Trumbal thus retir'd. Ye sacred Nine! that all my soul possess, Whose raptures fire me, and whose visions bless, Bear me, oh bear me to sequester'd scenes, The bow'ry mazes, and surrounding greens; To Thames's banks which fragrant breezes fill, Or where ye Muses sport on Cooper's hill. (On Cooper's hill eternal wreaths shall grow, While lasts the mountain, or while Thames shall flow) I seem thro' consecrated walks to rove, I hear soft music die along the grove; Led by the sound, I roam from shade to shade, By god-like Poets venerable made: Here his first lays majestic Denham sung; There the last numbers flow'd from Mr. Cowley died at Chertsey, on the borders of the Forest, and was from thence convey'd to Westminster. Cowley's tongue. O early lost! what tears the river shed, When the sad pomp along his banks was led? Ver. 273. What sighs, what murmurs fill'd the vocal shore! His tuneful swans were heard to sing no more.His drooping swans on ev'ry note expire, And on his willows hung each Muse's lyre. Since fate relentless stop'd their heav'nly voice, No more the forests ring, or groves rejoice; Who now shall charm the shades, where Cowley strung His living harp, and lofty Denham sung? But hark! the groves rejoice, the forest rings! Are these reviv'd? or is it Granville sings? 'Tis yours, my Lord, to bless our soft retreats, And call the Muses to their ancient seats; To paint anew the flow'ry sylvan scenes, To crown the forests with immortal greens, Make Windsor-hills in lofty numbers rise, And lift her turrets nearer to the skies; To sing those honours you deserve to wear, And add new lustre to her silver star. All the lines that follow, till within eight of the conclusion, were not added to the poem till the year 1710. The 425th verse, My humble Muse in unambitious strains, &amp;c. immediately follow'd this. Here noble Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, one of the first refiners of the English poetry; who flourish'd in the time of Henry VIII. Surrey felt the sacred rage, Surrey, the Granville of a former age: Matchless his pen, victorious was his lance, Bold in the lists, and graceful in the dance: In the same shades the Cupids tun'd his lyre, To the same notes, of love, and soft desire: Fair Geraldine, bright object of his vow, Then fill'd the groves, as heav'nly Myra now. Oh would'st thou sing what Heroes Windsor bore, What Kings first breath'd upon her winding shore, Or raise old warriours, whose ador'd remains In weeping vaults her hallow'd earth contains! With Edward III. born here. Edward's acts adorn the shining page, Stretch his long triumphs down thro' ev'ry age, Draw Monarchs chain'd, and Cressi's glorious field, The lillies blazing on the regal shield: Then, from her roofs when Verrio's colours fall, And leave inanimate the naked wall, Still in thy song should vanquish'd France appear, And bleed for ever under Britain's spear. Let softer strains ill-fated Henry VI. Henry mourn, And palms eternal flourish round his urn. Here o'er the martyr-King the marble weeps, And fast beside him, once-fear'd Edward IV. Edward sleeps: Whom not th'extended Albion could contain, From old Belerium to the northern main, The grave unites; where ev'n the Great find rest, And blended lie th'oppressor and th'opprest! Make sacred Charles's tomb for ever known, (Obscure the place, and un-inscrib'd the stone) Oh fact accurst! what tears has Albion shed, Heav'ns, what new wounds! and how her old have bled? She saw her sons with purple deaths expire, Her sacred domes involv'd in rolling fire, A dreadful series of intestine wars, Inglorious triumphs, and dishonest scars. At length great Anna said—“Let Discord cease!” She said, the World obey'd, and all was Peace! In that blest moment, from his oozy bed Between Verse 328 and 329 originally stood these lines, From shore to shore exulting shouts he heard, O'er all his banks a lambent light appear'd, With sparkling flames heav'ns glowing concave shone, Fictitious stars, and glories not her own. He saw, and gently rose above the stream; His shining horns diffus'd a golden gleam: With pearl and gold his tow'ry front was drest, The tributes of the distant East and West.Old father Thames advanc'd his rev'rend head. His tresses drop'd with dews, and o'er the stream His shining horns diffus'd a golden gleam: Grav'd on his urn, appear'd the Moon that guides His swelling waters, and alternate tydes; The figur'd streams in waves of silver roll'd, And on their banks Augusta rose in gold. Around his throne the sea-born brothers stood, Who swell with tributary urns his flood: First the fam'd authors of his ancient name, The winding Isis and the fruitful Tame: The Kennet swift, for silver eels renown'd; The Loddon slow, with verdant alders crown'd; Cole, whose clear streams his flow'ry islands lave; And chalky Wey, that rolls a milky wave: The blue, transparent Vandalis appears; The gulphy Lee his sedgy tresses rears; And sullen Mole, that hides his diving flood; And silent Darent, stain'd with Danish blood. High in the midst, upon his urn reclin'd, (His sea-green mantle waving with the wind) The God appear'd: he turn'd his azure eyes Where Windsor-domes and pompous turrets rise; Then bow'd and spoke; the winds forget to roar, And the hush'd waves glide softly to the shore. Hail, sacred Peace! hail long-expected days, That Thames's glory to the stars shall raise! Tho' Tyber's streams immortal Rome behold, Tho' foaming Hermus swells with tydes of gold, From heav'n itself tho' sev'n-fold Nilus flows, And harvests on a hundred realms bestows; These now no more shall be the Muse's themes, Lost in my fame, as in the sea their streams. Let Volga's banks with iron squadrons shine, And groves of lances glitter on the Rhine, Let barb'rous Ganges arm a servile train; Be mine the blessings of a peaceful reign. No more my sons shall dye with British blood Red Iber's sands, or Ister's foaming flood; Safe on my shore each unmolested swain Shall tend the flocks, or reap the bearded grain; The shady empire shall retain no trace Of war or blood, but in the sylvan chace; The trumpet sleep, while chearful horns are blown, And arms employ'd on birds and beasts alone. Behold! th'ascending Villa's on my side, Project long shadows o'er the crystal tyde. Behold! Augusta's glitt'ring spires increase, And temples rise, the beauteous works of Peace. I see, I see where two fair cities bend Their ample bow, a new White-ball ascend! There mighty nations shall enquire their doom, The world's great Oracle in times to come; There Kings shall sue, and suppliant States be seen Once more to bend before a British Queen. Ver. 383, &amp;c. were originally thus; Now shall our fleets the bloody Cross display To the rich regions of the rising day, Or those green isles, where headlong Titan steeps His hissing axle in th'Atlantic deeps. Tempt icy seas, &amp;c.Thy trees, fair Windsor! now shall leave their woods, And half thy forests rush into my floods, Bear Britain's thunder, and her Cross display, To the bright regions of the rising day; Tempt icy seas, where scarce the waters roll, Where clearer flames glow round the frozen Pole; Or under southern skies exalt their sails, Led by new stars, and borne by spicy gales! For me the balm shall bleed, and amber flow, The coral redden, and the ruby glow, The pearly shell its lucid globe infold, And Phœbus warm the ripening ore to gold. The time shall come, when free as seas or wind Unbounded Thames shall flow for all mankind, Whole nations enter with each swelling tyde, And seas but join the regions they divide; Earth's distant ends our glory shall behold, And the new world launch forth to seek the old. Then ships of uncouth form shall stem the tyde, And feather'd people croud my wealthy side, And naked youths and painted chiefs admire Our speech, our colour, and our strange attire! Oh stretch thy reign, fair Peace! from shore to shore, 'Till Conquest cease, and slav'ry be no more; 'Till the freed Indians in their native groves Reap their own fruits, and woo their sable loves, Peru once more a race of Kings behold, And other Mexico's be roof'd with gold. Exil'd by thee from earth to deepest hell, In brazen bonds shall barb'rous Discord dwell: Gigantic Pride, pale Terror, gloomy Care, And mad Ambition, shall attend her there: There purple Vengeance bath'd in gore retires, Her weapons blunted, and extinct her fires: There hateful Envy her own snakes shall feel, And Persecution mourn her broken wheel: There Faction roar, Rebellion bite her chain, And gasping Furies thirst for blood in vain. Here cease thy flight, nor with unhallow'd lays Touch the fair fame of Albion's golden days: The thoughts of Gods let Granville's verse recite, And bring the scenes of opening fate to light. My humble Muse, in unambitious strains, Paints the green forests and the flow'ry plains, Where Peace descending bids her olives spring, And scatters blessings from her dove-like wing. Ev'n I more sweetly pass my careless days, Pleas'd in the silent shade with empty praise; Enough for me, that to the list'ning swains First in these fields I sung the sylvan strains. ODE ON St. CECILIA's Day, 1708. AND OTHER PIECES for MUSIC. ODE for MUSIC ON St. CECILIA's Day. I. Descend ye Nine! descend and sing; The breathing instruments inspire, Wake into voice each silent string, And sweep the sounding lyre! In a sadly-pleasing strain Let the warbling lute complain: Let the loud trumpet sound, 'Till the roofs all around The shrill echo's rebound: While in more lengthen'd notes and slow, The deep, majestic, solemn organs blow. Hark! the numbers, soft and clear, Gently steal upon the ear; Now louder, and yet louder rise, And fill with spreading sounds the skies; Exulting in triumph now swell the bold notes, In broken air, trembling, the wild music floats; 'Till, by degrees, remote and small, The strains decay, And melt away, In a dying, dying fall. II. By Music, minds an equal temper know, Nor swell too high, nor sink too low. If in the breast tumultuous joys arise, Music her soft, assuasive voice applies; Or when the soul is press'd with cares, Exalts her in enlivening airs. Warriors she fires with animated sounds; Pours balm into the bleeding lover's wounds: Melancholy lifts her head, Morpheus rouzes from his bed, Sloth unfolds her arms and wakes, List'ning Envy drops her snakes; Intestine war no more our Passions wage, And giddy Factions hear away their rage. III. But when our Country's cause provokes to Arms, How martial music ev'ry bosom warms! So when the first bold vessel dar'd the seas, High on the stern the Thracian rais'd his strain, While Argo saw her kindred trees Descend from Pelion to the main. Transported demi-gods stood round, And men grew heroes at the sound, Enflam'd with glory's charms: Each chief his sev'nfold shield display'd, And half unsheath'd the shining blade: And seas, and rocks, and skies rebound To arms, to arms, to arms! IV. But when thro' all th'infernal bounds Which flaming Phlegeton surrounds, Love, strong as Death, the Poet led To the pale nations of the dead, What sounds were heard, What scenes appear'd, O'er all the dreary coasts! Dreadful gleams, Dismal screams, Fires that glow, Shrieks of woe, Sullen moans, Hollow groans, And cries of tortur'd ghosts! But hark! he strikes the golden lyre; And see! the tortur'd ghosts respire, See, shady forms advance! Thy stone, O Sysiphus, stands still, Ixion rests upon his wheel, And the pale spectres dance! The Furies sink upon their iron beds, And snakes uncurl'd hang list'ning round their heads. V. By the streams that ever flow, By the fragrant winds that blow O'er th'Elysian flow'rs, By those happy souls who dwell In yellow meads of Asphodel, Or Amaranthine bow'rs, By the hero's armed shades, Glitt'ring thro' the gloomy glades, By the youths that dy'd for love, Wand'ring in the myrtle grove, Restore, restore Eurydice to life; Oh take the husband, or return the wife! He sung, and hell consented To hear the Poet's pray'r; Stern Proserpine relented, And gave him back the fair. Thus song could prevail O'er death and o'er hell, A conquest how hard and how glorious? Tho' fate had fast bound her With Styx nine times round her, Yet music and love were victorious. VI. But soon, too soon, the lover turns his eyes: Again she falls, again she dies, she dies! How wilt thou now the fatal sisters move? No crime was thine, if 'tis no crime to love. Now under hanging mountains, Beside the falls of fountains, Or where Hebrus wanders, Rolling in Mæanders, All alone, Unheard, unknown, He makes his moan; And calls her ghost, For ever, ever, ever lost! Now with Furies surrounded, Despairing, confounded, He trembles, he glows, Amidst Rhodope's snows: See, wild as the winds, o'er the desart he flies; Hark! Hæmus resounds with the Bacchanals cries— —Ah see, he dies! Yet ev'n in death Eurydice he sung, Eurydice still trembled on his tongue, Eurydice the woods, Eurydice the floods, Eurydice the rocks, and hollow mountains rung. VII. Music the fiercest grief can charm, And fate's severest rage disarm: Music can soften pain to ease, And make despair and madness please: Our joys below it can improve, And antedate the bliss above. This the divine Cecilia found, And to her Maker's praise confin'd the sound. When the full organ joins the tuneful quire, Th'immortal pow'rs incline their ear; Borne on the swelling notes our souls aspire, While solemn airs improve the sacred fire; And Angels lean from heav'n to hear. Of Orpheus now no more let Poets tell, To bright Cecilia greater pow'r is giv'n; His numbers rais'd a shade from hell, Hers lift the soul to heav'n. Two CHORUS's to the Tragedy of Brutus. Chorus of Athenians. Strophe 1. Ye shades, where sacred truth is sought; Groves, where immortal Sages taught; Where heav'nly visions Plato fir'd, And Epicurus lay inspir'd! In vain your guiltless laurels stood Unspotted long with human blood. War, horrid war, your thoughtful walks invades, And steel now glitters in the Muses shades. Antistrophe 1 Oh heav'n-born sisters! source of art! Who charm the sense, or mend the heart; Who lead fair Virtue's train along, Moral Truth, and mystic Song! To what new clime, what distant sky, Forsaken, friendless, shall ye fly? Say, will ye bless the bleak Atlantic shore? Or bid the furious Gaul be rude no more? Strophe 2. When Athens sinks by fates unjust, When wild Barbarians spurn her dust; Perhaps ev'n Britain's utmost shore Shall cease to blush with stranger's gore, See Arts her savage sons controul, An Athens rising near the pole! 'Till some new Tyrant lifts his purple hand, And civil madness tears them from the land. Antistrophe 2. Ye Gods! what justice rules the ball? Freedom and Arts together fall; Fools grant whate'er Ambition craves, And men, once ignorant, are slaves. Oh curs'd effects of civil hate, In ev'ry age, in ev'ry state! Still, when the lust of tyrant pow'r succeeds, Some Athens perishes, some Tully bleeds. Chorus of Youths and Virgins. Semichorus. Oh Tyrant Love! hast thou possest The prudent, learn'd, and virtuous breast? Wisdom and wit in vain reclaim, And Arts but soften us to feel thy flame. Love, soft intruder, enters here, But entring learns to be sincere. Marcus with blushes owns he loves, And Brutus tenderly reproves. Why, Virtue, dost thou blame desire, Which nature has imprest? Why, Nature, dost thou soonest fire The mild and gen'rous breast? Chorus. Love's purer flames the Gods approve; The Gods and Brutus bend to love: Brutus for absent Portia sighs, And sterner Cassius melts at Junia's eyes. What is loose love? a transient gust, Spent in a sudden storm of lust, A vapour fed from wild desire, A wand'ring, self-consuming fire. But Hymen's kinder flames unite; And burn for ever one; Chaste as cold Cynthia's virgin light, Productive as the Sun. Semichorus. Oh source of ev'ry social tye, United wish, and mutual joy! What various joys on one attend, As son, as father, brother, husband, friend? Whether his hoary sire he spies, While thousand grateful thoughts arise; Or meets his spouse's fonder eye; Or views his smiling progeny; What tender passions take their turns, What home felt raptures move? His heart now melts, now leaps, now burns, With rev'rence, hope, and love. Chorus. Hence guilty joys, distastes, surmizes, Hence false tears, deceits, disguises, Dangers, doubts, delays, surprizes; Fires that scorch, yet dare not shine: Purest love's unwasting treasure, Constant faith, fair hope, long leisure, Days of ease, and nights of pleasure; Sacred Hymen! these are thine. ODE on Solitude. Happy the man, whose wish and care A few paternal acres bound, Content to breathe his native air, In his own ground. Whose herds with milk, whose fields with bread, Whose flocks supply him with attire, Whose trees in summer yield him shade, In winter fire. Blest, who can unconcern'dly find, Hours, days and years slide soft away, In health of body, peace of mind, Quiet by day, Sound sleep by night; study and ease, Together mixt; sweet recreation; And innocence which most does please, With meditation. Thus let me live, unseen, unknown, Thus unlamented let me die, Steal from the world, and not a stone Tell where I lie. The Dying Christian to his Soul, ODE. I Vital spark of heav'nly flame! Quit, oh quit this mortal frame: Trembling, hoping, ling'ring, flying, Oh the pain, the bliss of dying! Cease, fond Nature, cease thy strife, And let me languish into life. II Hark! they whisper; Angels say, Sister Spirit, come away. What is this absorbs me quite? Steals my senses, shuts my sight, Drowns my spirits, draws my breath? Tell me, my Soul, can this be Death? III The world recedes; it disappears! Heav'n opens on my eyes! my ears With sounds seraphic ring: Lend, lend your wings! I mount! I fly! O Grave! where is thy Victory? O Death! where is thy Sting? AN ESSAY ON CRITICISM. Written in the Year 1709. THE CONTENTS OF THE Essay on Criticism. PART I. 1. That 'tis as great a fault to judge ill, as to write-ill, and a more dangerous one to the public. 2. The variety of men's Tastes; of a true Taste, how rare to be found. 3. That most men are born with some Taste, but spoil'd by false education. 4. The multitude of Critics, and causes of 'em. 5. That we are to study our own Taste, and know the limits of it. 6. Nature the best guide of Judgment. 7. Improv'd by Art, and Rules, which are but methodiz'd Nature. 8. Rules deriv'd from the Practice of the ancient Poets. 9. That therefore the Ancients are necessary to be study'd by a Critic, particularly Homer and Virgil. 10. Of Licenses, and the use of 'em by the Ancients. 11. Reverence due to the Ancients, and praise of 'em. PART II. Ver. 204, &amp;c. Causes hind'ring a true Judgment, 1. Pride. 2. Imperfect Learning. 3. Judging by parts, and not by the whole: Critics in Wit, Language, Versification, only. 4. Being too hard to please, or too apt to admire. 5. Too much Love to a Sect,—to the Ancients or Moderns. 6. Prejudice, or Prevention. 7. Singularity. 8. Inconstancy. 9. Partiality. 10. Envy. Against Envy, and in praise of Good-nature. When Severity is chiefly to be used by Critics? Against Immorality and Obscenity. PART III. Ver. 565, &amp;c. Rules for the Conduct of Manners in a Critic. Candour, Modesty, Good-breeding, Sincerity and Freedom of Advice. When one's Counsel is to be restrain'd? Character of an incorrigible Poet.—And of an impertinent Critic. The Character of a good Critic. The History of Criticism, and Characters of the best Critics. Aristotle, Horace, Dionysius, Petronius, Quintilian, Longinus. Of the Decay of Criticism, and its Revival.— Erasmus, Vida, Boileau, Lord Roscommon, &amp;c.— Conclusion. 'Tis hard to say, if greater want of skill Appear in writing or in judging ill; But, of the two, less dang'rous is th'offence To tire our patience, than mislead our sense. Some few in that, but numbers err in this, Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss; A fool might once himself alone expose, Now one in verse makes many more in prose. 'Tis with our judgments as our watches, none Go just alike, yet each believes his own. In Poets as true Genius is but rare, True Taste as seldom is the Critic's share; Both must alike from heav'n derive their light, These born to judge, as well as those to write. Let Qui scribit artificiosè, ab aliis commodè scripta facile intelligere poterit. Cic. ad Herenn. lib. 4. such teach others who themselves excel, And censure freely who have written well. Authors are partial to their wit, 'tis true, But are not Critics to their judgment too? Yet if we look more closely, we shall find Most Omnes tacito quodam sensu, sine ulla arte, aut ratione, quæ sint in artibus ac rationibus recta ac prava dijudicant. Cic. de Orat. lib. 3. have the seeds of judgment in their mind: Nature affords at least a glimm'ring light; The lines, tho' touch'd but faintly, are drawn right. But as the slightest sketch, if justly trac'd, Is by ill-colouring but the more disgrac'd, Between Verse 25 and 26, were these lines, Many are spoil'd by that pedantic throng, Who with great pains teach youth to reason wrong. Tutors, like Virtuoso's, oft inclin'd By strange transfusion to improve the mind, Draw off the sense we have, to pour in new; Which yet with all their skill, they ne'er could do.So by false learning is good sense defac'd: Some are bewilder'd in the maze of schools, And some made coxcombs Nature meant but fools. In search of wit these lose their common sense, And then turn Critics in their own defence: Each burns alike, who can, or cannot write, Or with a Rival's, or an Eunuch's spite. All fools have still an itching to deride, And fain would be upon the laughing side. If Mævius scribble in Apollo's spight, There are, who judge still worse than he can write. Some have at first for Wits, then Poets past, Turn'd Critics next, and prov'd plain fools at last. Some neither can for Wits nor Critics pass, As heavy mules are neither horse nor ass. Those half-learn'd witlings, num'rous in our isle, As half-form'd insects on the banks of Nile; Unfinish'd things, one knows not what to call, Their generation's so equivocal: To tell 'em, would a hundred tongues require, Or one vain wit's, that might a hundred tire. But you who seek to give and merit fame, And justly bear a Critic's noble name, Be sure yourself and your own reach to know, How far your genius, taste, and learning go; Launch not beyond your depth, but be discreet, And mark that point where sense and dulness meet. Nature to all things fix'd the limits fit, And wisely curb'd proud man's pretending wit. As on the land while here the Ocean gains, In other parts it leaves wide sandy plains; Thus in the soul while memory prevails, The solid pow'r of understanding fails; Where beams of warm imagination play, The memory's soft figures melt away. One science only will one genius fit; So vast is art, so narrow human wit: Not only bounded to peculiar arts, But oft' in those confin'd to single parts. Like Kings we lose the conquests gain'd before, By vain ambition still to make them more; Each might his sev'ral province well command, Would all but stoop to what they understand. First follow Nature, and your judgment frame By her just standard, which is still the same: Unerring Nature, still divinely bright, One clear, unchang'd, and universal light, Life, force, and beauty, must to all impart, At once the source, and end, and test of art. Art from that fund each just supply provides, Works without show, and without pomp presides: In some fair body thus th'informing soul With spirits feeds, with vigour fills the whole, Each motion guides, and ev'ry nerve sustains; Itself unseen, but in th'effects, remains. There are whom heav'n has blest with store of wit, Yet want as much again to manage it; For wit and judgment ever are at strife, Tho' meant each other's aid, like man and wife. 'Tis more to guide, than spur the Muse's steed; Restrain his fury, than provoke his speed; The winged courser, like a gen'rous horse, Shows most true mettle when you check his course. Those Rules of old discover'd, not devis'd, Are nature still, but nature methodiz'd; Nature, like Monarchy, is but restrain'd By the same laws which first herself ordain'd. Hear how learn'd Greece her useful rules indites, When to repress, and when indulge our flights! High on Parnassus' top her sons she show'd, And pointed out those arduous paths they trod, Held from afar, aloft, th'immortal prize, And urg'd the rest by equal steps to rise. Just Nec enim artibus editis factum est ut argumenta inveniremus, sed dicta sunt omnia antequam præciperentur, mox ea scriptores observata &amp; collecta ediderunt. Quintil. precepts thus from great examples giv'n, She drew from them what they deriv'd from heav'n. The gen'rous Critic fann'd the Poet's fire, And taught the world with reason to admire. Then Criticism the Muses handmaid prov'd, To dress her charms, and make her more belov'd: But following wits from that intention stray'd, Who cou'd not win the mistress, woo'd the maid; Against the Poets their own arms they turn'd, Sure to hate most the men from whom they learn'd. So modern 'Pothecaries, taught the art By Doctor's bills to play the Doctor's part, Bold in the practice of mistaken rules, Prescribe, apply, and call their masters fools. Some on the leaves of antient authors prey, Nor time nor moths e'er spoil'd so much as they. Some drily plain, without invention's aid, Write dull receits how poems may be made. These lose the sense, their learning to display, And those explain the meaning quite away. You then whose judgment the right course would steer, Know well each Ancient's proper character; His Fable, Subject, scope in every page; Religion, Country, genius of his Age: Without all these at once before your eyes, Cavil you may, but never criticize. Between Verse 124 and 125; Zoilus, had these been known, without a name Had dy'd, and Perault ne'er been damn'd to fame; The sense of sound Antiquity had reign'd, And sacred Homer yet been unprophan'd. None e'er had thought his comprehensive mind To modern Customs, modern Rules confin'd; Who for all Ages writ and all Mankind.Be Homer's works your study, and delight, Read them by day, and meditate by night; Thence form your judgment, thence your notions bring, And trace the Muses upward to their spring. Still with itself compar'd, his text peruse; Or let your comment be the Mantuan Muse. Virgil, Eclog 6. Cum canerem Reges &amp; Prælia, Cynthius aurem Vellit ?When first young Maro sung of Kings and wars, Ver. 131. When first great Maro in his boundless mind A work t'outlast Immortal Rome design'd.E'er warning Phœbus touch'd his trembling ears, Perhaps he seem'd above the Critic's law, And but from Nature's fountains scorn'd to draw: But when t'examine ev'ry part he came, Nature and Homer were, he found, the same: Convinc'd, amaz'd, he checks the bold design; And rules as strict his labour'd work confine, Ver. 138. And did his work to rules as strict confine.As if the Stagyrite o'erlook'd each line. Learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem; To copy nature is to copy them. Some beauties yet no precepts can declare, For there's a happiness as well as care. Music resembles Poetry, in each Are nameless graces which no methods teach, And which a master-hand alone can reach. If, Neque tam sancta sunt ista Præcepta, sed hoc quicquid est, Utilitas excogitavit; Non negabo autem sic utile esse plerunque; verum si eadem illa nobis aliud suadebit utilitas, hanc, relictis magistrorum autoritatibus, sequemur. Quintil. lib. 2. cap. 13. where the rules not far enough extend, (Since rules were made but to promote their end) Some lucky Licence answers to the full Th'intent propos'd, that Licence is a rule. Thus Pegasus, a nearer way to take, May boldly deviate from the common track. Great Wits sometimes may gloriously offend, And rise to faults true Critics dare not mend, From vulgar bounds with brave disorder part, And snatch a grace beyond the reach of art, Which without passing thro' the judgment, gains The heart, and all its end at once attains. In prospects, thus, some objects please our eyes, Which out of nature's common order rise, The shapeless rock, or hanging precipice. But care in poetry must still be had, It asks discretion ev'n in running mad: And tho' the Ancients thus their rules invade, (As Kings dispense with laws themselves have made) Moderns beware! or if you must offend Against the precept, ne'er trangress its end: Let it be seldom, and compell'd by need; And have, at least, their precedent to plead. The Critic else proceeds without remorse, Seizes your fame, and puts his laws in force. I know there are, to whose presumptuous thoughts Those freer beauties, ev'n in them, seem faults. Some figures monstrous and mishap'd appear, Consider'd singly, or beheld too near, Which, but proportion'd to their light, or place, Due distance reconciles to form and grace. A prudent chief not always must display His pow'rs in equal ranks, and fair array, But with th'occasion and the place comply, Conceal his force, nay seem sometimes to fly. Those oft' are stratagems which errors seem, Nor is it Homer nods, but we that dream. Still green with bays each ancient Altar stands, Above the reach of sacrilegious hands; Secure from flames, from envy's fiercer rage, Destructive war, and all-devouring age. See, from each clime the learn'd their incense bring: Hear, in all tongues consenting Pæans ring! In praise so just let ev'ry voice be join'd, And fill the gen'ral Chorus of mankind! Hail, Bards triumphant! born in happier days; Immortal heirs of universal praise! Whose honours with increase of ages grow, As streams roll down, enlarging as they flow! Nations unborn your mighty names shall sound, And worlds applaud that must not yet be found! Oh may some spark of your celestial fire, The last, the meanest of your sons inspire, (That on weak wings, from far, pursues your flights; Glows while he reads, but trembles as he writes) To teach vain Wits a science little known, T'admire superiour sense, and doubt their own! Of all the causes which conspire to blind Man's erring judgment, and misguide the mind, What the weak head with strongest biass rules, Is Pride, the never-failing vice of fools. Whatever nature has in worth deny'd, She gives in large recr[illeg.]s of needful pride; For as in bodies, thus in souls we find What wants in blood and spirits, swell'd with wind: Pride, where Wit fails, steps in to our defence, And fills up all the mighty void of sense. If once right reason drives that cloud away, Truth breaks upon us with resistless day. Trust not yourself; but your defects to know, Make use of ev'ry friend—and ev'ry foe. A little Learning is a dang'rous thing; Drink deep, or taste not the Piërian spring: There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain, And drinking largely sobers us again. Fir'd at first sight with what the Muse imparts, In fearless youth we tempt the heights of Arts, While from the bounded level of our mind, Short views we take, nor see the lengths behind, But more advanc'd, behold with strange surprize New distant scenes of endless science rise! Ver. 227. So pleas'd at first the tow'ring Alps to try, Fill'd with ideas of fair Italy, The traveller beholds with chearful eyes The less'ning vales, and seems to tread the skies.So pleas'd at first the tow'ring Alps we try, Mount o'er the vales, and seem to tread the sky, Th'eternal snows appear already past, And the first clouds and mountains seem the last: But those attain'd, we tremble to survey The growing labours of the lengthen'd way, Th'increasing prospect tires our wand'ring eyes, Hills peep o'er hills, and Alps on Alps arise! Diligenter legendum est, ac pæne ad scribendi sollicitudinem: Nec per partes modo scrutanda sunt omnia, sed perlectus liber utique ex integro rosumendus. Quintil.A perfect Judge will read each work of wit, With the same spirit that its author writ, Survey the Whole, nor seek slight faults to find Where nature moves, and rapture warms the mind; Nor lose, for that malignant dull delight, The gen'rous pleasure to be charm'd with wit. But in such lays as neither ebb, nor flow, Correctly cold, and regularly low, That shunning faults, one quiet tenour keep; We cannot blame indeed—but we may sleep. In wit, as nature, what affects our hearts Is not th'exactness of peculiar parts; 'Tis not a lip, or eye, we beauty call, But the joint force and full result of all. Thus when we view some well-proportion'd dome, (The world's just wonder, and ev'n thine, O Rome!) No single parts unequally surprize, All comes united to th'admiring eyes; No monstrous height, or breadth, or length appear; The Whole at once is bold, and regular. Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see, Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er shall be. In ev'ry work regard the writer's End, Since none can compass more than they intend; And if the means be just, the conduct true, Applause, in spight of trivial faults, is due. As men of breeding, sometimes men of wit, T'avoid great errors, must the less commit. Neglect the rules each verbal Critic lays, For not to know some trifles, is a praise. Most Critics, fond of some subservient art, Still make the whole depend upon a part: They talk of principles, but notions prize, And all to one lov'd Folly sacrifice. Once on a time, La Mancha's Knight, they say, A certain Bard encount'ring on the way, Discours'd in terms as just, with looks as sage, As e'er could Dennis, of the laws o'th' stage; Concluding all were desp'rate sots and fools, Who durst depart from Aristotle's rules. Our author, happy in a judge so nice, Produc'd his Play, and begg'd the Knight's advice; Made him observe the subject and the plot, The manners, passions, unities; what not? All which, exact to rule, were brought about, Were but a Combate in the lists left out. “What! leave the combate out?” exclaims the knight; Yes, or we must renounce the Stagyrite. “Not so by heav'n” (he answers in a rage) “Knights, squires, and steeds, must enter on the stage.” The stage can ne'er so vast a throng contain. “Then build a new, or act it in a Plain. Thus Critics, of less judgment than caprice, Curious, not knowing, not exact, but nice, Form short Ideas; and offend in arts (As most in manners) by a love to parts. Some to Conceit alone their taste confine, And glitt'ring thoughts struck out at ev'ry line; Pleas'd with a work where nothing's just or fit; One glaring Chaos and wild heap of wit. Poets like painters, thus, unskill'd to trace The naked nature and the living grace, With gold and jewels cover ev'ry part, And hide with Ornaments their want of art. True Naturam intueamur, hanc sequamur: id facillimè accipiunt animi quod agnoscunt. Quintil. lib. 8. c. 3. wit is nature to advantage dress'd, What oft' was thought, but ne'er so well express'd; Something, whose truth convinc'd at sight we find, That gives us back the image of our mind. As shades more sweetly recommend the light, So modest plainness sets off sprightly wit: For works may have more wit than does 'em good, As bodies perish thro' excess of blood. Others for Language all their care express, And value books, as women men, for Dress: Their praise is still, the Style is excellent: The Sense, they humbly take upon content. Words are like leaves; and where they most abound, Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found. False Eloquence, like the Prismatic glass, Its gaudy colours spreads on ev'ry place; The face of nature we no more survey, All glares alike, without distinction gay: But true Expression, like th'unchanging Sun, Clears, and improves whate'er it shines upon, It gilds all objects, but it alters none. Expression is the dress of thought, and still Appears more decent, as more suitable; A vile conceit in pompous words express'd, Is like a clown in regal purple dress'd: For diff'rent styles with diff'rent subjects sort, As several garbs with country, town, and court. Some Abolita &amp; abrogata retinere, insolentiæ cujusdam est, &amp; frivolæ in parvis jactantiæ. Quintil. lib. 1. c. 6. Opus est ut verba à vetustate repetita neque crebra sint, neque manifesta quia nil est odiosius affectatione, nec utique ab ultimis repetita temporibus. Oratio cujus summa virtus est perspicuitas, quam sit vitiosa si egeat interprete? Ergo ut novorum optima erunt maximè vetera, ita veterum maximè nova. Idem. by old words to fame have made pretence: Ancients in phrase, meer moderns in their sense! Such labour'd nothings, in so strange a style, Amaze th'unlearn'd, and make the learned smile. Unlucky, as Fungoso in the Ben. Johnson's Every Man in his Humour. Play, These sparks with aukward vanity display What the fine Gentleman wore yesterday, And but so mimic ancient wits at best, As apes our grandsires, in their doublets drest. In words, as fashions, the same rule will hold; Alike fantastic, if too new, or old; Be not the first by whom the new are try'd, Nor yet the last to lay the old aside. Quis populi sermo est? quis enim? nisi carmine molli Nunc demum numero fluere ut per læve severos Effugit junctura ungues: scit tendere versum, Non secus ac si oculo rubricam dirigat uno. Persius, Sat. 1.But most by Numbers judge a Poet's song, And smooth or rough, with them, is right or wrong; In the bright Muse tho' thousand charms conspire, Her Voice is all these tuneful fools admire; Who haunt Parnassus but to please their ear, Not mend their minds; as some to Church repair, Not for the doctrine, but the music there. These equal syllables alone require, Tho' Fugiemus crebras vocalium concursiones, quæ vastam atque hiantem orationem reddunt. Cic. ad Herenn. lib. 4. Vide etiam Quintil. lib. 9. c. 4. oft' the ear the open vowels tire; While expletives their feeble aid do join; And ten low words oft' creep in one dull line; While they ring round the same unvary'd chimes, With sure returns of still-expected rhymes. Where-e'er you find the cooling western breeze, In the next line, it whispers thro' the trees; If crystal streams with pleasing murmurs creep, The reader's threaten'd (not in vain) with sleep. Then, at the last and only couplet fraught With some unmeaning thing they call a thought, A needless Alexandrine ends the song, That like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along. Leave such to tune their own dull rhimes, and know What's roundly smooth, or languishingly slow; And praise the easy vigour of a line, Where Denham's strength, and Waller's sweetness join. True ease in writing comes from art, not chance, As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance. 'Tis not enough no harshness gives offence, The sound must seem an echo to the sense. Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows, And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows; But when loud surges lash the sounding shore, The hoarse, rough verse should like the torrent roar. When Ajax strives, some rock's vast weight to throw, The line too labours, and the words move slow; Not so, when swift Camilla scours the plain, Flies o'er th'unbending corn, and skims along the main. Hear how Alexander's Feast, or the Power of Music; An Ode by Mr. Dryden. Timotheus' vary'd lays surprize, And bid alternate passions fall and rise! While, at each change, the son of Libyan Jove Now burns with glory, and then melts with love: Now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow, Now sighs steal out, and tears begin to flow: Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found, And the World's victor stood subdu'd by Sound! The pow'r of Music all our hearts allow; And what Timotheus was, is Dryden now. Avoid Extremes; and shun the fault of such, Who still are pleas'd too little or too much. At ev'ry trifle scorn to take offence, That always shows great pride, or little sense; Those heads, as stomachs, are not sure the best, Which nauseate all, and nothing can digest. Yet let not each gay Turn thy rapture move, For fools admire, but men of sense approve. As things seem large which we thro' mists descry, Dulness is ever apt to magnify. Some the French writers, some our own despise; The Ancients only, or the Moderns prize. (Thus Wit, like Faith, by each man is apply'd To one small sect, and all are damn'd beside.) Meanly they seek the blessing to confine, And force that sun but on a part to shine, Which not alone the southern wit sublimes, But ripens spirits in cold northern climes; Which from the first has shone on ages past, Enlights the present, and shall warm the last: (Tho' each may feel encreases and decays, And see now clearer and now darker days) Regard not then if wit be old or new, But blame the false, and value still the true. Some ne'er advance a judgment of their own, But catch the spreading notion of the town; They reason and conclude by precedent, And own stale nonsense which they ne'er invent. Some judge of authors names, not works, and then Nor praise nor blame the writings, but the men. Of all this servile herd, the worst is he That in proud dulness joins with Quality, A constant Critic at the great man's board, To fetch and carry nonsense for my Lord. What woful stuff this madrigal would be, In some starv'd hackney sonneteer, or me? But let a Lord once own the happy lines, How the wit brightens! how the style refines! Before his sacred name flies ev'ry fault, And each exalted stanza teems with thought! The Vulgar thus through Imitation err; As oft' the Learn'd by being singular; So much they scorn the croud, that if the throng By chance go right, they purposely go wrong: So Schismatics the plain believers quit, And are but damn'd for having too much wit. Some praise at morning what they blame at night; But always think the last opinion right. A Muse by these is like a mistress us'd, This hour she's idoliz'd, the next abus'd; While their weak heads, like towns unfortify'd, 'Twixt sense and nonsense daily change their side. Ask them the cause; they're wiser still, they say; And still to-morrow's wiser than to-day. We think our fathers fools, so wise we grow; Our wiser sons, no doubt, will think us so. Once School-divines this zealous isle o'er-spread; Who knew most Sentences, was deepest read; Faith, Gospel, all, seem'd made to be disputed, And none had sense enough to be confuted: Scotists and Thomists, now, in peace remain, Ver. 447. Duck-lane.] A place where old and secondhand books were sold formerly, near Smithfield.Amidst their kindred cobwebs in Duck-lane. If Faith itself has diff'rent dresses worn, Between Verse 449 and 450; The rhyming Clowns that gladded Shakespear's age, No more with crambo entertain the stage. Who now in Anagrams their Patron praise, Or sing their Mistress in Acrostic lays? Ev'n pulpits pleas'd with merry puns of yore; Now all are banish'd to the Hibernian shore! Thus leaving what was natural and fit, The current folly prov'd their ready wit; And authors thought their reputation safe, Which liv'd as long as fools were pleas'd to laugh.What wonder Modes in Wit should take their turn? Oft', leaving what is natural and fit, The current folly proves the ready wit; And authors think their reputation safe, Which lives as long as fools are pleas'd to laugh. Some valuing those of their own side or mind, Still make themselves the measure of mankind: Fondly we think we honour merit then, When we but praise our selves in other men. Parties in Wit attend on those of State, And publick faction doubles private hate. Pride, Malice, Folly, against Dryden rose, In various shapes of Parsons, Critics, Beaus; But sense surviv'd, when merry jests were past; For rising merit will buoy up at last. Might he return, and bless once more our eyes, New Blackmores and new Milbourns must arise: Nay should great Homer lift his awful head, Zoilus again would start up from the dead. Envy will merit, as its shade, pursue; But like a shadow, proves the substance true; For envy'd Wit, like Sol eclips'd, makes known Th'opposing body's grossness, not its own. When first that sun too pow'rful beams displays, It draws up vapours which obscure its rays; But ev'n those clouds at last adorn its way, Reflect new glories, and augment the day. Be thou the first true merit to befriend, His praise is lost, who stays 'till all commend. Short is the date, alas, of modern rhymes, And 'tis but just to let 'em live betimes. No longer now that golden age appears, When Patriarch-wits surviv'd a thousand years: Now length of fame (our second life) is lost, And bare threescore is all ev'n that can boast: Our sons their fathers failing language see, And such as Chaucer is, shall Dryden be. So when the faithful pencil has design'd Some bright Idea of the master's mind, Where a new world leaps out at his command, And ready nature waits upon his hand; When the ripe colours soften and unite, And sweetly melt into just shade and light, When mellowing years their full perfection give, And each bold figure just begins to live; Ver. 494. The treach'rous colours in few years decay.The treach'rous colours the fair art betray, And all the bright creation fades away! Unhappy Wit, like most mistaken things, Attones not for that envy which it brings. In youth alone its empty praise we boast, But soon the short-liv'd vanity is lost! Ver. 500. Like some fair flow'r that in the spring does rise.Like some fair flow'r the early spring supplies, That gayly blooms, but ev'n in blooming dies. What is this wit, which must our cares employ? The owner's wife, that other men enjoy; The most our trouble still when most admir'd; The more we give, the more is still requir'd; The fame with pains we gain, but lose with ease; Sure some to vex, but never all to please; 'Tis what the vicious fear, the virtuous shun, By fools 'tis hated, and by knaves undone! If wit so much from ign'rance undergo, Ah let not learning too commence its foe! Of old, those met rewards who could excel, And such were prais'd who but endeavour'd well: Tho' Triumphs were to Gen'rals only due, Crowns were reserv'd to grace the soldiers too. Now, they who reach Parnassus' lofty crown, Employ their pains to spurn some others down; And while self-love each jealous writer rules, Contending wits become the sport of fools. But still the worst with most regret commend, For each ill Author is as bad a Friend. To what base ends, and by what abject ways, Are mortals urg'd thro' sacred Lust of praise! Ah ne'er so dire a thirst of glory boast, Nor in the Critic let the Man be lost! Good-nature and good-sense must ever join; To err is humane, to forgive, divine. But if in noble minds some dregs remain, Not yet purg'd off, of spleen and sour disdain; Discharge that rage on more provoking crimes, Nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times. No pardon vile Obscenity should find, Tho' wit and art conspire to move your mind; But Dulness with obscenity must prove As shameful sure as Impotence in love. In the fat age of pleasure, wealth, and ease, Sprung the rank weed, and thriv'd with large increase; When Love was all an easy Monarch's care; Seldom at council, never in a war: Jilts rul'd the state, and statesmen Farces writ; Nay wits had pensions, and young Lords had wit: The Fair sate panting at a Courtier's play, And not a Mask went unimprov'd away: The modest fan was lifted up no more, And Virgins smil'd at what they blush'd before. The following licence of a Foreign reign Did all the dregs of bold Socinus drain; Ver. 548. The Author has omitted two lines which stood here, as containing a National Reflection, which in his stricter judgment he could not but disapprove, on any People whatever.Then unbelieving Priests reform'd the nation, And taught more pleasant methods of salvation; Where heav'ns free subjects might their rights dispute, Lest God himself should seem too Absolute: Pulpits their sacred satire learn'd to spare, And Vice admir'd to find a flatt'rer there! Encourag'd thus, Wit's Titans brav'd the skies, And the Press groan'd with licens'd blasphemies. These monsters, Critics! with your darts engage, Here point your thunder, and exhaust your rage! Yet shun their fault, who, scandalously nice, Will needs mistake an author into vice; All seems infected that th'infected spy, As all looks yellow to the jaundic'd eye. Learn then what Morals Critics ought to show, For 'tis but half a judge's task, to know. 'Tis not enough, wit, art, and learning join; In all you speak, let truth and candour shine: That not alone what to your judgment's due All may allow; but seek your friendship too. Be silent always when you doubt your sense; And speak, tho' sure, with seeming diffidence: Some positive, persisting fops we know, That, if once wrong, will needs be always so; But you, with pleasure own your errors past, And make each day a Critic on the last. 'Tis not enough, your counsel still be true; Blunt truths more mischief than nice falshoods do; Men must be taught as if you taught them not, And things unknown propos'd as things forgot. Without good-breeding, truth is disapprov'd; That only makes superiour sense belov'd. Be niggards of advice on no pretence; For the worst avarice is that of sense. With mean complacence ne'er betray your trust, Nor be so civil as to prove unjust. Fear not the anger of the wise to raise; Those best can bear reproof, who merit praise. 'Twere well might Critics still this freedom take; But Appius reddens at each word you speak, And stares, tremendous, with a threat'ning eye, Like some fierce Tyrant in old Tapestry. Fear most to tax an Honourable fool, Whose right it is, uncensur'd to be dull; Such without wit are Poets when they please, As without learning they can take Degrees. Leave dang'rous truths to unsuccessful Satyrs, And flattery to fulsome Dedicators, Whom, when they praise, the world believes no more, Than when they promise to give scribling o'er. 'Tis best sometimes your censure to restrain, And charitably let the dull be vain: Your silence there is better than your spite, For who can rail so long as they can write? Still humming on, their drouzy course they keep, And lash'd so long, like Tops, are lash'd asleep. False steps but help them to renew the race, As after stumbling, Jades will mend their pace. What crouds of these, impenitently bold, In sounds and jingling syllables grown old, Still run on Poets, in a raging vein, Ev'n to the dregs and squeezings of the brain, Strain out the last dull droppings of their sense, And rhyme with all the rage of Impotence. Such shameless Bards we have; and yet 'tis true, There are as mad, abandon'd Critics too. The bookful blockhead, ignorantly read, With loads of learned lumber in his head, With his own tongue still edifies his ears, And always list'ning to himself appears. All books he reads, and all he reads assails, From Dryden's Fables down to Durfey's Tales. With him, most authors steal their works, or buy; Garth did not write his own Dispensary. Name a new Play, and he's the Poet's friend, Nay show'd his faults—but when wou'd Poets mend? No place so sacred from such fops is barr'd, Between Verse 625 and 626; In vain you shrug, and sweat, and strive to fly, These know no Manners, but in Poetry: They'll stop a hungry Chaplain in his Grace, To treat of Unities of Time and Place.Nor is Paul's church more safe than Paul's church-yard: Nay, fly to altars; there they'll talk you dead; For Fools rush in where Angels fear to tread. Distrustful sense with modest caution speaks, It still looks home, and short excursions makes; But rattling nonsense in full vollies breaks, And never shock'd, and never turn'd aside, Bursts out, resistless, with a thund'ring tyde. But where's the man, who counsel can bestow, Still pleas'd to teach, and yet not proud to know? Unbiass'd, or by favour, or by spite; Not dully prepossess'd; or blindly right; Tho' learn'd, well-bred; and tho' well-bred, sincere; Modestly bold, and humanly severe: Who to a friend his faults can freely show, And gladly praise the merit of a foe? Blest with a taste exact, yet unconfin'd; A knowledge both of books and human-kind; Gen'rous converse; a soul exempt from pride; And love to praise, with reason on his side? Such once were Critics; such the happy few, Athens and Rome in better ages knew. The mighty Stagyrite first left the shore, Spread all his sails, and durst the deeps explore; He steer'd securely, and discover'd far, Between Verse 650 and 651; He when all Nature was subdu'd before, Like his great pupil, sigh'd, and long'd for more: Fancy's wild regions yet unvanquish'd lay, A boundless empire, and that own'd no sway. Poets, &amp;c.Led by the light of the Mæonian Star. Poets, a race long unconfin'd, and free, Still fond and proud of savage liberty, Receiv'd his laws; and stood convinc'd 'twas fit Who conquer'd Nature, should preside o'er Wit. Horace still charms with graceful negligence, And without method talks us into sense, Will like a friend, familiarly convey The truest notions in the easiest way. He, who supreme in judgment, as in wit, Might boldly censure, as he boldly writ, Yet judg'd with coolness, tho' he sung with fire, His Precepts teach but what his works inspire. Our Critics take a contrary extreme, They judge with fury, but they write with fle'me: Nor suffers Horace more in wrong Translations By Wits, than Critics in as wrong Quotations. See Dionysius of Halicarnassus. Dionysius Homer's thoughts refine, And call new beauties forth from ev'ry line! Fancy and art in gay Petronius meet, The scholar's learning, with the courtier's wit. In grave Quintilian's copious work, we find The justest rules, and clearest method join'd: Thus useful arms in magazines we place, All rang'd in order, and dispos'd with grace; Nor thus alone the curious eye to please, But to be found, when need requires, with ease. Ver. 677. The Muses sure Longinus did inspire.Thee, bold Longinus! all the Nine inspire, And bless their Critic with a Poet's fire. An ardent judge, who zealous in his trust, With warmth gives sentence, yet is always just; Whose own example strengthens all his laws, And is himself that great Sublime he draws. Thus long succeeding Critics justly reign'd, Licence repress'd, and useful laws ordain'd. Learning and Rome alike in empire grew, And Arts still follow'd where her Eagles flew. From the same foes, at last, both felt their doom, And the same age saw Learning fall, and Rome. With Tyranny, then Superstition join'd, As that the body, this enslav'd the mind; Ver. 691. All was believ'd, but nothing understood.Much was believ'd, but little understood, And to be dull was constru'd to be good; Between Verse 692 and 693; Vain Wits and Critics were no more allow'd, When none but Saints had licence to be proud.A second deluge learning thus o'er-run, And the Monks finish'd what the Goths begun. At length Erasmus, that great, injur'd name, (The glory of the Priesthood, and the shame!) Stem'd the wild torrent of a barb'rous age, And drove those holy Vandals off the stage. But see! each Muse, in Leo's golden days, Starts from her trance, and trims her wither'd bays! Rome's ancient Genius, o'er its ruins spread, Shakes off the dust, and rears his rev'rend head. Then Sculpture and her sister-arts revive; Stones leap'd to form, and rocks began to live; With sweeter notes each rising Temple rung; A Raphael painted, and a M. Hieronymus Vida, an excellent Latin Poet, who writ an Art of Poetry in verse. He flourish'd in the time of Leo the tenth. Vida sung. Immortal Vida! on whose honour'd brow The Poet's bays and Critic's ivy grow: Cremona now shall ever boast thy name, As next in place to Mantua, next in fame! But soon by impious arms from Latium chas'd, Their ancient bounds the banish'd Muses pass'd; Thence arts o'er all the northern world advance; But critic learning flourish'd most in France: The rules, a nation born to serve, obeys; And Boileau still in right of Horace sways. But we, brave Britons, foreign laws despis'd, And kept unconquer'd, and unciviliz'd, Fierce for the liberties of wit, and bold, We still defy'd the Romans, as of old. Yet some there were, among the sounder few Of those who less presum'd, and better knew, Who durst assert the juster ancient cause, And here restor'd Wit's fundamental laws. Such was the Muse, whose rules and practice tell, Nature's Essay on Poetry, by the Duke of Buckingham. chief Master-piece is writing well. Such was Roscommon—not more learn'd than good, With manners gen'rous as his noble blood; To him the wit of Greece and Rome was known, And ev'ry author's merit but his own. Such late was Walsh,—the Muse's judge and friend, Who justly knew to blame or to commend; To failings mild, but zealous for desert; The clearest Head, and the sincerest Heart. This humble praise, lamented Shade! receive, This praise at least a grateful Muse may give: The Muse, whose early voice you taught to sing, Prescrib'd her heights, and prun'd her tender wing, (Her guide now lost) no more attempts to rise, But in low numbers short excursions tries: Content, if hence th'unlearn'd their wants may view, The learn'd reflect on what before they knew: Careless of censure, nor too fond of fame; Still pleas'd to praise, yet not afraid to blame; Averse alike to flatter, or offend; Not free from faults, nor yet too vain to mend. THE RAPE of the LOCK. AN HEROI-COMICAL POEM. Written in the Year 1712. The first sketch of this Poem was written in less than a fortnight's time, in 1711, in two Canto's, and so printed in a Miscellany, without the name of the Author. The Machines were not inserted till a year after, when he publish'd it, and annex'd the foregoing Dedication. Nolueram, Belinda, tuos violare capillos; Sed juvat hoc precibus me tribuisse tuis. Martial. TO Mrs. Arabella Fermor. CANTO I. What dire offence from am'rous causes springs, What mighty contests rise from trivial things, I sing—This verse to C?, Muse! is due: This, ev'n Belinda may vouchsafe to view: Slight is the subject, but not so the praise, If She inspire, and He approve my lays. Say what strange motive, Goddess! could compel A well-bred Lord t'assault a gentle Belle? Oh say what stranger cause, yet unexplor'd, Cou'd make a gentle Belle reject a Lord? Ver. 11, 12. It was in the first editions, And dwells such rage in softest bosoms then, And lodge such daring Souls in little Men?In tasks so bold, can little men engage, And in soft bosoms dwells such mighty Rage? Ver. 13, &amp;c. Sol thro' white curtains did his beams display, And ope'd those eyes which brighter shine than they, Shock just had giv'n himself the rousing shake, And Nymphs prepar'd their Chocolate to take; Thrice the wrought slipper knock'd against the ground, And striking watches the tenth hour resound. Sol thro' white curtains shot a tim'rous ray, And ope'd those eyes that must eclipse the day; Now lap-dogs give themselves the rousing shake, And sleepless lovers, just at twelve, awake: Thrice rung the bell, the slipper knock'd the ground, And the press'd watch return'd a silver sound. Belinda still her downy pillow prest, Her guardian Sylph prolong'd the balmy rest: 'Twas he had summon'd to her silent bed The morning-dream that hover'd o'er her head. A Youth more glitt'ring than a Birth-night Beau, (That ev'n in slumber caus'd her cheek to glow) Seem'd to her ear his winning lips to lay, And thus in whispers said, or seem'd to say. Fairest of mortals, thou distinguish'd care Of thousand bright Inhabitants of Air! If e'er one Vision touch'd thy infant thought, Of all the Nurse and all the Priest have taught; Of airy Elves by moonlight shadows seen, The silver token, and the circled green, Or virgins visited by Angel-pow'rs, With golden crowns and wreaths of heav'nly flow'rs; Hear and believe! thy own importance know, Nor bound thy narrow views to things below. Some secret truths, from learned pride conceal'd, To Maids alone and Children are reveal'd: What tho' no credit doubting Wits may give? The Fair and Innocent shall still believe. Know then, unnumber'd Spirits round thee fly, The light Militia of the lower sky; These, tho' unseen, are ever on the wing, Hang o'er the Box, and hover round the Ring: Think what an Equipage thou hast in Air, And view with scorn two Pages and a Chair. As now your own, our beings were of old, And once inclos'd in Woman's beauteous mold; Thence, by a soft transition, we repair From earthly Vehicles to these of air. Think not, when Woman's transient breath is fled, That all her vanities at once are dead: Succeeding vanities she still regards, Ver. 54, 55. ? Quæ gratia currûm Armorumque fuit vivis, quæ cura nitentes Pascere equos, eadem sequitur tellure repostos. Virg. Æn. 6.And tho' she plays no more, o'erlooks the cards. Her joy in gilded Chariots, when alive, And love of Ombre, after death survive. For when the Fair in all their pride expire, To their first Elements the Souls retire: The Sprites of fiery Termagants in Flame Mount up, and take a Salamander's name. Soft yielding minds to Water glide away, And sip, with Nymphs, their elemental Tea. The graver Prude sinks downward to a Gnome, In search of mischief still on Earth to roam. The light Coquettes in Sylphs aloft repair, And sport and flutter in the fields of Air. Know farther yet; whoever fair and chaste Rejects mankind, is by some Sylph embrac'd: For Spirits, freed from mortal laws, with ease Assume what sexes and what shapes they please. What guards the purity of melting Maids In courtly balls, and midnight masquerades, Safe from the treach'rous friend, the daring spark, The glance by day, the whisper in the dark, When kind occasion prompts their warm desires, When music softens, and when dancing fires? 'Tis but their Sylph, the wise Celestials know, Tho' Honour is the word with Men below. Some nymphs there are, too conscious of their face, For life predestin'd to the Gnomes embrace. These swell their prospects and exalt their pride, When offers are disdain'd, and love deny'd: Then gay Ideas croud the vacant brain, While Peers and Dukes, and all their sweeping train, And Garters, Stars, and Coronets appear, And in soft sounds, Your Grace salutes their ear. 'Tis these that early taint the female soul, Instruct the eyes of young Coquettes to roll, Teach Infants cheeks a bidden blush to know, And little hearts to flutter at a Beau. Oft' when the world imagine women stray, The Sylphs thro' mystic mazes guide their way, Thro' all the giddy circle they pursue, And old impertinence expel by new. What tender maid but must a victim fall To one man's treat, but for another's ball? When Florio speaks, what virgin could withstand, If gentle Damon did not squeeze her hand? With varying vanities, from ev'ry part, They shift the moving Toyshop of their heart; Where wigs with wigs, with sword-knots sword-knots strive, Beaus banish beaus, and coaches coaches drive. This erring mortals Levity may call, Oh blind to truth! the Sylphs contrive it all. Of these am I, who thy protection claim, A watchful sprite, and Ariel is my name. Late, as I rang'd the crystal wilds of air, In the clear Mirror of thy ruling Star I saw, alas! some dread event impend, E'er to the main this morning sun descend. But heav'n reveals not what, or how, or where: Warn'd by thy Sylph, oh pious maid, beware! This to disclose is all thy guardian can. Beware of all, but most beware of Man! He said; when Shock, who thought she slept too long, Leap'd up, and wak'd his mistress with his tongue. 'Twas then Belinda, if report say true, Thy eyes first open'd on a Billet-doux; Wounds, Charms, and Ardors, were no sooner read, But all the Vision vanish'd from thy head. And now, unveil'd, the Toilet stands display'd, Each silver Vase in mystic order laid. First, robe'd in white, the nymph intent adores With head uncover'd, the Cosmetic pow'rs. A heav'nly Image in the glass appears, To that she bends, to that her eyes she rears; Th'inferior Priestess, at her altar's side, Trembling, begins the sacred rites of Pride. Unnumber'd treasures ope at once, and here The various off'rings of the world appear; From each she nicely culls with curious toil, And decks the Goddess with the glitt'ring spoil. This casket India's glowing gems unlocks, And all Arabia breathes from yonder box. The Tortoise here and Elephant unite, Transform'd to combs, the speckled, and the white. Here files of pins extend their shining rows, Puffs, Powders, Patches, Bibles, Billet-doux. Now awful Beauty puts on all its arms; The fair each moment rises in her charms, Repairs her smiles, awakens ev'ry grace, And calls forth all the wonders of her face; Sees by degrees a purer blush arise, And keener lightnings quicken in her eyes. Ver. 145. The busy Sylphs, &amp;c.] Ancient Traditions of the Rabbi's relate, that several of the fallen Angels became amorous of Women, and particularize some; among the rest Asael, who lay with Naamah, the wife of Noah, or of Ham; and who continuing impenitent, still presides over the Women's Toilets. Bereshi Rabbi in Genes. 6. 2.The busy Sylphs surround their darling care, These set the head, and those divide the hair, Some fold the sleeve, whilst others plait the gown; And Betty's prais'd for labours not her own. CANTO II. Not with more glories, in th'etherial plain, The Sun first rises o'er the purpled main, Than issuing forth, the rival of his beams Lanch'd on the bosom of the silver Thames. Fair Nymphs, and well-drest Youths around her shone, But ev'ry eye was fix'd on her alone. On her white breast a sparkling Cross she wore, Which Jews might kiss, and Infidels adore. Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose, Quick as her eyes, and as unfix'd as those: Favours to none, to all she smiles extends, Oft' she rejects, but never once offends. Bright as the sun, her eyes the gazers strike, And, like the sun, they shine on all alike. Yet graceful ease, and sweetness void of pride Might hide her faults, if Belles had faults to hide: If to her share some female errors fall, Look on her face, and you'll forget 'em all. This Nymph, to the destruction of mankind, Nourish'd two Locks, which graceful hung behind In equal curls, and well conspir'd to deck With shining ringlets the smooth iv'ry neck: Love in these labyrinths his slaves detains, And mighty hearts are held in slender chains. With hairy sprindges we the birds betray, Slight lines of hair surprize the finny prey, Fair tresses man's imperial race insnare, And beauty draws us with a single hair. Th'advent'rous Baron the bright locks admir'd, He saw, he wish'd, and to the prize aspir'd. Resolv'd to win, he meditates the way, By force to ravish, or by fraud betray; For when success a Lover's toil attends, Few ask, if fraud or force attain'd his ends. For this, e'er Phœbus rose, he had implor'd Propitious heav'n, and ev'ry pow'r ador'd, But chiefly Love—to Love an altar built, Of twelve vast French Romances, neatly gilt. There lay three garters, half a pair of gloves; And all the trophies of his former loves. With tender Billet-doux he lights the pyre, And breathes three am'rous sighs to raise the fire. Then prostrate falls, and begs with ardent eyes Soon to obtain, and long possess the prize: Virg. Æn. 11.The Pow'rs gave ear, and granted half his pray'r, The rest, the winds dispers'd in empty air. But now secure the painted vessel glides, The sun-beams trembling on the floating tydes; While melting music steals upon the sky, And soften'd sounds along the waters die; Smooth flow the waves, the Zephyrs gently play, Belinda smil'd, and all the world was gay. All but the Sylph—with careful thoughts opprest, Th'impending woe sate heavy on his breast. He summons strait his Denizens of air; The lucid squadrons round the sails repair: Soft o'er the shrouds aerial whispers breathe, That seem'd but Zephyrs to the train beneath. Some to the sun their insect-wings unfold, Waft on the breeze, or sink in clouds of gold; Transparent forms, too fine for mortal sight, Their fluid bodies half dissolv'd in light. Loose to the wind their airy garments flew, Thin glitt'ring textures of the filmy dew, Dipt in the richest tincture of the skies, Where light disports in ever-mingling dyes, While ev'ry beam new transient colours flings, Colours that change whene'er they wave their wings. Amid the circle, on the gilded mast, Superior by the head, was Ariel plac'd; His purple pinions opening to the sun, He rais'd his azure wand, and thus begun. Ye Sylphs and Sylphids, to your chief give ear, Fays, Fairies, Genii, Elves, and Dæmons hear! Ye know the spheres and various tasks assign'd By laws eternal to th'aerial kind. Some in the fields of purest Æther play, And bask and whiten in the blaze of day. Some guide the course of wand'ring orbs on high, Or roll the planets thro' the boundless sky. Some less refin'd, beneath the moon's pale light Pursue the stars that shoot athwart the night, Or suck the mists in grosser air below, Or dip their pinions in the painted bow, Or brew fierce tempests on the wintry main, Or o'er the glebe distill the kindly rain. Others on earth o'er human race preside, Watch all their ways, and all their actions guide: Of these the chief the care of Nations own, And guard with Arms divine the British Throne. Our humbler province is to tend the Fair; Not a less pleasing, tho' less glorious care: To save the powder from too rude a gale, Nor let th'imprison'd essences exhale; To draw fresh colours from the vernal flow'rs; To steal from rainbows e'er they drop in show'rs A brighter wash; to curl their waving hairs, Assist their blushes, and inspire their airs; Nay oft', in dreams, invention we bestow, To change a Flounce, or add a Furbelow. This day, black Omens threat the brightest Fair That e'er deserv'd a watchful spirit's care; Some dire disaster, or by force, or slight; But what, or where, the fates have wrapt in night. Whether the nymph shall break Diana's law, Or some frail China jar receive a flaw, Or stain her honour, or her new brocade, Forget her pray'rs, or miss a masquerade, Or lose her heart, or necklace, at a ball; Or whether Heav'n has doom'd that Shock must fall. Haste then, ye spirits! to your charge repair; The flutt'ring fan be Zephyretta's care; The drops to thee, Brillante, we consign; And, Momentilla, let the watch be thine; Do thou, Crispissa, tend her fav'rite Lock; Ariel himself shall be the guard of Shock. To fifty chosen Sylphs, of special note, We trust th'important charge, the Petticoat: Oft' have we known that seven-fold fence to fail, Tho' stiff with hoops, and arm'd with ribs of whale. Form a strong line about the silver bound, And guard the wide circumference around. Whatever spirit, careless of his charge, His post neglects, or leaves the fair at large, Shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins, Be stop'd in vials, or transfix'd with pins; Or plung'd in lakes of bitter washes lie, Or wedg'd whole ages in a bodkin's eye: Gums and Pomatums shall his flight restrain, While clog'd he beats his silken wings in vain; Or Alom stypticks with contracting pow'r Shrink his thin essence like a rivell'd flow'r: Or as Ixion fix'd, the wretch shall feel The giddy motion of the whirling Mill, In fumes of burning Chocolate shall glow, And tremble at the sea that froaths below! He spoke; the spirits from the sails descend; Some, orb in orb, around the nymph extend; Some thrid the mazy ringlets of her hair; Some hang upon the pendants of her ear; With beating hearts the dire event they wait, Anxious, and trembling for the birth of Fate. CANTO III. Close by those meads, for ever crown'd with flow'rs, Where Thames with pride surveys his rising tow'rs, There stands a structure of majestic frame, Which from the neighb'ring Hampton takes its name. Here Britain's statesmen oft' the fall foredoom Of foreign Tyrants, and of Nymphs at home; Here thou, great Anna! whom three realms obey, Dost sometimes counsel take—and sometimes Tea. Hither the heroes and the nymphs resort, To taste a while the pleasures of a Court; Ver. 11. 12. Originally in the first edition, In various talk the chearful hours they past, Of, who was bitt, or who capotted last.In various talk th'instructive hours they past, Who gave the ball, or paid the visit last; One speaks the glory of the British Queen, And one describes a charming Indian screen; A third interprets motions, looks, and eyes; At ev'ry word a reputation dies. Snuff, or the fan, supply each pause of chat, With singing, laughing, ogling, and all that. Mean while declining from the noon of day, The sun obliquely shoots his burning ray; The hungry Judges soon the sentence sign, And wretches hang that jury-men may dine; The merchant from th'Exchange returns in peace, And the long labours of the Toilet cease. Belinda now, whom thirst of fame invites, Burns to encounter two advent'rous Knights, At Ombre singly to decide their doom; And swells her breast with conquests yet to come. Strait the three bands prepare in arms to join, Each band the number of the sacred nine. Soon as she spreads her hand, th'aerial guard Descend, and sit on each important card: First Ariel perch'd upon a Matadore, Then each, according to the rank they bore; For Sylphs, yet mindful of their ancient race, Are, as when women, wondrous fond of place. Behold, four Kings in majesty rever'd, With hoary whiskers and a forky beard; And four fair Queens whose hands sustain a flow'r, Th'expressive emblem of their softer pow'r; Four Knaves in garbs succinct, a trusty band, Caps on their heads, and halberts in their hand; And particolour'd troops, a shining train, Draw forth to combat on the velvet plain. The skilful Nymph reviews her force with care: Let Spades be trumps! she said, and trumps they were. Now move to war her sable Matadores, In show like leaders of the swarthy Moors. Spadillio first, unconquerable Lord! Led off two captive trumps, and swept the board. As many more Manillio forc'd to yield, And march'd a victor from the verdant field. Him Basto follow'd, but his fate more hard Gain'd but one trump and one Plebeian card. With his broad sabre next, a chief in years, The hoary Majesty of Spades appears, Puts forth one manly leg, to sight reveal'd, The rest, his many-colour'd robe conceal'd. The rebel Knave, who dares his prince engage, Proves the just victim of his royal rage. Ev'n mighty Pam, that Kings and Queens o'erthrew, And mow'd down armies in the fights of Lu, Sad chance of war! now destitute of aid, Falls undistinguish'd by the victor Spade! Thus far both armies to Belinda yield; Now to the Baron fate inclines the field. His warlike Amazon her host invades, Th'imperial consort of the crown of Spades. The Club's black Tyrant first her victim dy'd, Spite of his haughty mien, and barb'rous pride: What boots the regal circle on his head, His giant limbs, in state unwieldly spread; That long behind he trails his pompous robe, And, of all monarchs, only grasps the globe? The Baron now his Diamonds pours apace; Th'embroider'd King who shows but half his face, And his refulgent Queen, with pow'rs combin'd, Of broken troops an easy conquest find. Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, in wild disorder seen, With throngs promiscuous strow the level green. Thus when dispers'd a routed army runs, Of Asia's troops, and Afric's sable sons, With like confusion different nations fly, Of various habit, and of various dye, The pierc'd battalions dis-united fall, In heaps on heaps; one fate o'erwhelms them all. The Knave of Diamonds tries his wily arts, And wins (oh shameful chance!) the Queen of Hearts. At this, the blood the virgin's cheek forsook, A livid paleness spreads o'er all her look; She sees, and trembles at th'approaching ill, Just in the jaws of ruin, and Codille. And now, (as oft' in some distemper'd State) On one nice Trick depends the gen'ral fate. An Ace of Hearts steps forth: The King unseen Lurk'd in her hand, and mourn'd his captive Queen: He springs to vengeance with an eager pace, And falls like thunder on the prostrate Ace. The nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky; The walls, the woods, and long canals reply. Oh thoughtless mortals! ever blind to fate, Too soon dejected, and too soon elate! Sudden, these honours shall be snatch'd away, And curs'd for ever this victorious day. For lo! the board with cups and spoons is crown'd, The berries crackle, and the mill turns round; On shining Altars of Japan they raise The silver lamp; the fiery spirits blaze: From silver spouts the grateful liquors glide, While China's earth receives the smoaking tyde: At once they gratify their scent and taste, And frequent cups prolong the rich repaste. Strait hover round the Fair her airy band; Some, as she sipp'd, the fuming liquor fann'd, Some o'er her lap their careful plumes display'd, Trembling, and conscious of the rich brocade. Coffee, (which makes the politician wise, And see thro' all things with his half-shut eyes) Sent up in vapours to the Baron's brain New stratagems, the radiant Lock to gain. Ah cease, rash youth! desist e'er 'tis too late, Fear the just Gods, and think of Vide Ovid. Metam. 8. Scylla's Fate! Chang'd to a bird, and sent to flit in air, She dearly pays for Nisus' injur'd hair! But when to mischief mortals bend their will, How soon they find fit instruments of ill? Just then, Clarissa drew with tempting grace A two-edg'd weapon from her shining case; So Ladies in Romance assist their Knight, Present the spear, and arm him for the fight. He takes the gift with rev'rence, and extends The little engine on his finger's ends; This just behind Belinda's neck he spread, As o'er the fragrant steams she bends her head. Swift to the Lock a thousand Sprites repair, A thousand wings, by turns, blow back the hair; And thrice they twitch'd the diamond in her ear; Thrice she look'd back, and thrice the foe drew near. Just in that instant, anxious Ariel sought The close recesses of the Virgin's thought; As on the nosegay in her breast reclin'd, He watch'd th'Ideas rising in her mind, Sudden he view'd, in spite of all her art, An earthly Lover lurking at her heart. Amaz'd, confus'd, he found his pow'r expir'd, Resign'd to fate, and with a sigh retir'd. The Peer now spreads the glitt'ring Forfex wide, T'inclose the Lock; now joins it, to divide. Ev'n then, before the fatal engine clos'd, A wretched Sylph too fondly interpos'd; Fate urg'd the sheers, and cut the Sylph in twain, ( See Milton, lib. 6. of Satan cut asunder by the Angel Michael.But airy substance soon unites again) The meeting points the sacred hair dissever From the fair head, for ever, and for ever! Then flash'd the living lightning from her eyes, And screams of horror rend th'affrighted skies. Not louder shrieks to pitying heav'n are cast, When husbands or when lapdogs breathe their last; Or when rich China vessels fall'n from high, In glitt'ring dust, and painted fragments lie! Let wreaths of triumph now my temples twine, (The Victor cry'd) the glorious Prize is mine! While fish in streams, or birds delight in air, Or in a Coach and six the British Fair, As long as Atalantis shall be read, Or the small pillow grace a Lady's bed, While visits shall be paid on solemn days, When num'rous wax-lights in bright order blaze, While nymphs take treats, or assignations give, So long my honour, name, and praise shall live! What Time wou'd spare, from Steel receives its date, And monuments, like men, submit to fate! Steel could the labour of the Gods destroy, And strike to dust th'imperial tow'rs of Troy; Steel could the works of mortal pride confound, And hew triumphal arches to the ground. What wonder then, fair nymph! thy hairs shou'd feel The conqu'ring force of unresisted steel? CANTO IV. Ver. 1. Virg. Æn. 4. At regina gravi, &amp;c. But anxious cares the pensive nymph oppress'd, And secret passions labour'd in her breast. Not youthful kings in battle seiz'd alive, Not scornful virgins who their charms survive, Not ardent lovers robb'd of all their bliss, Not ancient ladies when refus'd a kiss, Not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die, Not Cynthia when her manteau's pinn'd awry, E'er felt such rage, resentment, and despair, As thou, sad Virgin! for thy ravish'd Hair. For, that sad moment, when the Sylphs withdrew, And Ariel weeping from Belinda flew, Umbriel, a dusky, melancholy sprite, As ever sully'd the fair-face of light, Down to the central earth, his proper scene, Repair'd to search the gloomy Cave of Spleen. Swift on his sooty pinions flits the Gnome, And in a vapour reach'd the dismal dome. No chearful breeze this sullen region knows, The dreaded East is all the wind that blows. Here in a grotto, shelter'd close from air, And screen'd in shades from day's detested glare, She sighs for ever on her pensive bed, Pain at her side, and Megrim at her head. Two handmaids wait the throne: alike in place, But diff'ring far in figure and in face. Here stood Ill-nature like an ancient maid, Her wrinkled form in black and white array'd; With store of pray'rs, for mornings, nights, and noons, Her hand is fill'd; her bosom with lampoons. There Affectation, with a sickly mien, Shows in her cheek the roses of eighteen, Practis'd to lisp, and hang the head aside, Faints into airs and languishes with pride, On the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe, Wrapt in a gown, for sickness, and for show. The fair-ones feel such maladies as these, When each new night-dress gives a new disease. A constant Vapour o'er the palace flies; Strange phantoms rising as the mists arise; Dreadful, as hermit's dreams in haunted shades, Or bright, as visions of expiring maids. Now glaring fiends, and snakes on rolling spires, Pale spectres, gaping tombs, and purple fires: Now lakes of liquid gold, Elysian scenes, And crystal domes, and Angels in machines. Unnumber'd throngs on ev'ry side are seen, Of bodies chang'd to various forms by Spleen. Here living Tea-pots stand, one arm held out, One bent; the handle this, and that the spout: A Pipkin there, like See Hom. Iliad 18. of Vulcan's walking Tripods. Homer's Tripod walks; Here sighs a Jar, and there a Alludes to a real fact, a Lady of distinction imagin'd herself in this condition. Goose-pye talks; Men prove with child, as pow'rful fancy works, And maids turn'd bottles, call aloud for corks. Safe past the Gnome thro' this fantastic band, A branch of healing Spleenwort in his hand. Then thus address'd the pow'r—Hail wayward Queen! Who rule the sex to fifty from fifteen: Parent of vapours and of female wit, Who give th'hysteric, or poetic fit, On various tempers act by various ways, Make some take physic, others scribble plays; Who cause the proud their visits to delay, And send the godly in a pett, to pray. A Nymph there is, that all thy pow'r disdains, And thousands more in equal mirth maintains. But oh! if e'er thy Gnome could spoil a grace, Or raise a pimple on a beauteous face, Like Citron-waters matrons cheeks inflame, Or change complexions at a losing game; If e'er with airy horns I planted heads, Or rumpled petticoats, or tumbled beds, Or caus'd suspicion when no soul was rude, Or discompos'd the head-dress of a Prude, Or e'er to costive lap-dog gave disease, Which not the tears of brightest eyes could ease: Hear me, and touch Belinda with chagrin: That single act gives half the world the spleen. The Goddess with a discontented air Seems to reject him, tho' she grants his pray'r. A wond'rous Bag with both her hands she binds, Like that where once Ulysses held the winds; There she collects the force of female lungs, Sighs, sobs, and passions, and the war of tongues. A Vial next she fills with fainting fears, Soft sorrows, melting griefs, and flowing tears. The Gnome rejoicing bears her gifts away, Spreads his black wings, and slowly mounts to day. Sunk in Thalestris' arms the nymph he found, Her eyes dejected and her hair unbound. Full o'er their heads the swelling bag he rent, And all the Furies issued at the vent. Belinda burns with more than mortal ire, And fierce Thalestris fans the rising fire. O wretched maid! she spread her hands, and cry'd, (While Hampton's echoes, wretched maid! reply'd) Was it for this you took such constant care The bodkin, comb, and essence to prepare? For this your locks in paper durance bound, For this with tort'ring irons wreath'd around? For this with fillets strain'd your tender head, And bravely bore the double loads of lead? Gods! shall the ravisher display your hair, While the Fops envy, and the Ladies stare! Honour forbid! at whose unrival'd shrine Ease, pleasure, virtue, all our sex resign. Methinks already I your tears survey, Already hear the horrid things they say, Already see you a degraded toast, And all your honour in a whisper lost! How shall I, then, your helpless fame defend? 'Twill then be infamy to seem your friend! And shall this prize, th'inestimable prize, Expos'd thro' crystal to the gazing eyes, And heighten'd by the diamond's circling rays, On that rapacious hand for ever blaze? Sooner shall grass in Hyde-park Circus grow, And wits take lodgings in the sound of Bow; Sooner let earth, air, sea, to Chaos fall, Men, monkeys, lap-dogs, parrots, perish all! She said; then raging to Sir Plume repairs, And bids her Beau demand the precious hairs: (Sir Plume, of amber Snuff-box justly vain, And the nice conduct of a clouded cane) With earnest eyes, and round unthinking face, He first the snuff-box open'd, then the case, And thus broke out—“My Lord, why, what the devil? “Z?ds! damn the lock! 'fore Gad, you must be civil! “Plague on't! 'tis past a jest—nay prithee, pox! “Give her the hair”—he spoke, and rapp'd his box. It grieves me much (reply'd the Peer again) Who speaks so well should ever speak in vain. But In allusion to Achilles's oath in Homer. Il. 1. by this Lock, this sacred Lock I swear, (Which never more shall join its parted hair; Which never more its honours shall renew, Clip'd from the lovely head where late it grew) That while my nostrils draw the vital air, This hand which won it, shall for ever wear. He spoke, and speaking, in proud triumph spread The long-contended honours of her head. But Umbriel, hateful Gnome! forbears not so; He breaks the Vial whence the sorrows flow. Then see! the nymph in beauteous grief appears, Her eyes half-languishing, half-drown'd in tears; On her heav'd bosom hung her drooping head, Which, with a sigh, she rais'd; and thus she said. For ever curs'd be this detested day, Which snatch'd my best, my fav'rite curl away! Happy! ah ten times happy had I been, If Hampton-Court these eyes had never seen! Yet am not I the first mistaken maid, By love of Courts to num'rous ills betray'd. Oh had I rather un-admir'd remain'd In some lone isle, or distant Northern land; Where the gilt Chariot never marks the way, Where none learn Ombre, none e'er taste Bohea! There kept my charms conceal'd from mortal eye, Like roses, that in desarts bloom and die. What mov'd my mind with youthful Lords to roam? O had I stay'd, and said my pray'rs at home! 'Twas this, the morning omens seem'd to tell; Thrice from my trembling hand the patch-box fell; The tott'ring China shook without a wind, Nay Poll sate mute, and Shock was most unkind! A Sylph too warn'd me of the threats of fate, In mystic visions, now believ'd too late! See the poor remnants of these slighted hairs! My hands shall rend what ev'n thy rapine spares: These, in two sable ringlets taught to break, Once gave new beauties to the snowy neck; The sister-lock now sits uncouth, alone, And in its fellow's fate foresees its own; Uncurl'd it hangs, the fatal sheers demands, And tempts once more thy sacrilegious hands. Oh hadst thou, cruel! been content to seize Hairs less in sight, or any hairs but these! CANTO V. She said: the pitying audience melt in tears. But Fate and Jove had stopp'd the Baron's ears. In vain Thalestris with reproach assails, For who can move when fair Belinda fails? Not half so fix'd the Trojan could remain, While Anna begg'd and Dido rage'd in vain. Then grave Clarissa graceful wav'd her fan; Silence ensu'd, and thus the nymph began. Ver. 9, &amp;c. Parody of the Speech of Sarpedon to Glaucus in Homer.Say why are Beauties prais'd and honour'd most, The wise man's passion, and the vain man's toast? Why deck'd with all that land and sea afford, Why Angels call'd, and Angel-like ador'd? Why round our coaches croud the white-glov'd Beaus, Why bows the side-box from its inmost rows? How vain are all these glories, all our pains, Unless good sense preserve what beauty gains: That men may say, when we the front-box grace, Behold the first in virtue, as in face! Oh! if to dance all night, and dress all day, Charm'd the small-pox, or chas'd old-age away; Who would not scorn what houswife's cares produce, Or who would learn one earthly thing of use? To patch, nay ogle, might become a Saint, Nor could it sure be such a sin to paint. But since, alas! frail beauty must decay, Curl'd or uncurl'd, since Locks will turn to grey; Since painted, or not painted, all shall fade, And she who scorns a man, must die a maid; What then remains but well our pow'r to use, And keep good-humour still whate'er we lose? And trust me, dear! good-humour can prevail, When airs, and flights, and screams, and scolding fail. Beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll; Charms strike the sight, but merit wins the soul. It is a verse frequently repeated in Homer after any speech, So spoke ? and all the Heroes applauded.So spoke the Dame, but no applause ensu'd; Belinda frown'd, Thalestris call'd her Prude. To arms, to arms! the fierce Virago cries, And swift as lightning to the combat flies. All side in parties, and begin th'attack; Fans clap, silks russle, and tough whalebones crack; Heroes and Heroines shouts confus'dly rise, And base, and treble voices strike the skies. No common weapons in their hands are found, Like Gods they fight, nor dread a mortal wound. Homer, Il. 20.So when bold Homer makes the Gods engage, And heav'nly breasts with human passions rage; 'Gainst Pallas, Mars; Latona, Hermes arms; And all Olympus rings with loud alarms: Jove's thunder roars, heav'n trembles all around; Blue Neptune storms, the bellowing deeps resound; Earth shakes her nodding tow'rs, the ground gives way, And the pale ghosts start at the flash of day! Minerva in like manner, during the Battle of Ulysses with the Suitors in Odyss. perches on a beam of the roof to behold it.Triumphant Umbriel on a sconce's height Clap'd his glad wings, and sate to view the fight: Prop'd on their bodkin spears, the Sprites survey The growing combat, or assist the fray. While thro' the press enrag'd Thalestris flies, And scatters deaths around from both her eyes, A Beau and Witling perish'd in the throng, One dy'd in metaphor, and one in song. “O cruel nymph! a living death I bear,” Cry'd Dapperwit, and sunk beside his chair. A mournful glance Sir Fopling upwards cast, The Words of a Song in the Opera of Camilla.Those eyes are made so killing—was his last. Ov. Ep. Sic ubi fata vocant, udis abjectus in herbis, Ad vada Mæandri concinit albus olor.Thus on Mæander's flow'ry margin lies Th'expiring Swan, and as he sings he dies. When bold Sir Plume had drawn Clarissa down, Chloe stepp'd in, and kill'd him with a frown; She smil'd to see the doughty hero slain, But, at her smile, the Beau reviv'd again. Vid. Homer Il. 8. &amp; Virg. Æn. 12.Now Jove suspends his golden scales in air, Weighs the Men's wits against the Lady's hair; The doubtful beam long nods from side to side; At length the wits mount up, the hairs subside. See fierce Belinda on the Baron flies, With more than usual lightning in her eyes: Nor fear'd the Chief th'unequal fight to try, Who sought no more than on his foe to die. But this bold Lord with manly strength endu'd, She with one finger and a thumb subdu'd: Just where the breath of life his nostrils drew, A charge of Snuff the wily virgin threw; The Gnomes direct, to ev'ry atome just, The pungent grains of titillating dust. Sudden, with starting tears each eye o'erflows, And the high dome re-echoes to his nose. Now meet thy fate, incens'd Belinda cry'd, And drew a deadly bodkin from her side. ( In imitation of the progress of Agamemnon's sceptre in Homer, Il. 2.The same, his ancient personage to deck, Her great great grandsire wore about his neck, In three seal-rings; which after, melted down, Form'd a vast buckle for his widow's gown: Her infant grandame's whistle next it grew, The bells she jingled, and the whistle blew; Then in a bodkin grac'd her mother's hairs, Which long she wore, and now Belinda wears.) Boast not my fall (he cry'd) insulting foe! Thou by some other shalt be laid as low. Nor think, to die dejects my lofty mind: All that I dread is leaving you behind! Rather than so, ah let me still survive, And burn in Cupid's flames,—but burn alive. Restore the Lock! she cries; and all around Restore the Lock! the vaulted roofs rebound. Not fierce Othello in so loud a strain Roar'd for the handkerchief that caus'd his pain. But see how oft' ambitious aims are cross'd, And chiefs contend 'till all the prize is lost! The Lock, obtain'd with guilt, and kept with pain, In ev'ry place is sought, but sought in vain: With such a prize no mortal must be blest, So heav'n decrees! with heav'n who can contest? Some thought it mounted to the Lunar sphere, Vid. Ariosto, Canto 34.Since all things lost on earth are treasur'd there. There Hero's wits are kept in pond'rous vases; And Beau's in snuff-boxes and tweezer-cases. There broken vows, and death-bed alms are found; And lover's hearts with ends of ribband bound, The courtier's promises, and sick man's pray'rs, The smiles of harlots, and the tears of heirs, Cages for gnats, and chains to yoak a flea, Dry'd butterflies, and tomes of casuistry. But trust the Muse—she saw it upward rise, Tho' mark'd by none but quick, poetic eyes: (So Rome's great founder to the heav'ns withdrew, To Proculus alone confess'd in view) A sudden Star, it shot thro' liquid air, And drew behind a radiant trail of hair. Not Berenice's Locks first rose so bright, The heav'ns bespangling with dishevel'd light. The Sylphs behold it kindling as it flies, And pleas'd pursue its progress thro' the skies. This the Beau-monde shall from the Mall survey, And hail with music its propitious ray. This the blest Lover shall for Venus take, And send up vows from Rosamonda's lake. Ver. 137. John Partridge was a ridiculous Stargazer, who in his Almanacks every year, never fail'd to predict the downfall of the Pope, and the King of France, then at war with the English.This Partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies, When next he looks thro' Galilæo's eyes; And hence th'egregious wizard shall foredoom The fate of Louis, and the fall of Rome. Then cease, bright Nymph! to mourn thy ravish'd hair, Which adds new glory to the shining sphere! Not all the tresses that fair head can boast, Shall draw such envy as the Lock you lost. For, after all the murders of your eye, When, after millions slain, yourself shall die; When those fair suns shall set, as set they must, And all those tresses shall be laid in dust; This Lock, the Muse shall consecrate to fame, And 'midst the stars inscribe Belinda's name. ELOISA TO ABELARD. The ARGUMENT. Abelard and Eloisa flourish'd in the twelfth Century; they were two of the most distinguish'd persons of their age in learning and beauty, but for nothing more famous than for their unfortunate passion. After a long course of Calamities, they retired each to a several Convent, and consecrated the remainder of their days to religion. It was many years after this separation, that a letter of Abelard's to a Friend, which contain'd the history of his misfortune, fell into the hands of Eloisa. This awakening all her tenderness, occasion'd those celebrated letters (out of which the following is partly extracted) which give so lively a picture of the struggles of grace and nature, virtue and passion. In these deep solitudes and awful cells, Where heav'nly-pensive, contemplation dwells, And ever-musing melancholy reigns; What means this tumult in a Vestal's veins? Why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat? Why feels my heart its long-forgotten heat? Yet, yet I love!—From Abelard it came, And Eloïsa yet must kiss the name. Dear fatal name! rest ever unreveal'd, Nor pass these lips in holy silence seal'd: Hide it, my heart, within that close disguise, Where mix'd with God's, his lov'd Idea lies: Oh write it not, my hand—the name appears Already written—wash it out, my tears! In vain lost Eloïsa weeps and prays, Her heart still dictates, and her hand obeys. Relentless walls! whose darksom round contains Repentant sighs, and voluntary pains: Ye rugged rocks! which holy knees have worn; Ye grots and caverns shagg'd with horrid thorn! Shrines! where their vigils pale-ey'd virgins keep, And pitying saints, whose statues learn to weep! Tho' cold like you, unmov'd and silent grown, I have not yet forgot my self to stone. Heav'n claims me all in vain, while he has part, Still rebel nature holds out half my heart; Nor pray'rs nor fasts its stubborn pulse restrain, Nor tears, for ages, taught to flow in vain. Soon as thy letters trembling I unclose, That well-known name awakens all my woes. Oh name for ever sad! for ever dear! Still breath'd in sighs, still usher'd with a tear. I tremble too where'er my own I find, Some dire misfortune follows close behind. Line after line my gushing eyes o'erflow, Led thro' a sad variety of woe: Now warm in love, now with'ring in thy bloom, Lost in a convent's solitary gloom! There stern Religion quench'd th'unwilling flame, There dy'd the best of passions, Love and Fame. Yet write, oh write me all, that I may join Griefs to thy griefs, and echo sighs to thine. Nor foes nor fortune take this pow'r away; And is my Abelard less kind than they? Tears still are mine, and those I need not spare, Love but demands what else were shed in pray'r; No happier task these faded eyes pursue; To read and weep is all they now can do. Then share thy pain, allow that sad relief; Ah, more than share it! give me all thy grief. Heav'n first taught letters for some wretch's aid, Some banish'd lover, or some captive maid; They live, they speak, they breathe what love inspires, Warm from the soul, and faithful to its fires, The virgin's wish without her fears impart, Excuse the blush, and pour out all the heart, Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul, And waft a sigh from Indus to the Pole. Thou know'st how guiltless first I met thy flame, When Love approach'd me under Friendship's name; My fancy form'd thee of angelick kind, Some Emanation of th'all-beauteous Mind. Those smiling eyes, attemp'ring ev'ry ray, Shone sweetly lambent with celestial day. Guiltless I gaz'd; heav'n listen'd while you sung; And truths He was her Preceptor in Philosophy and Divinity. divine came mended from that tongue. From lips like those what precept fail'd to move? Too soon they taught me 'twas no sin to love: Back thro' the paths of pleasing sense I ran, Nor wish'd an Angel whom I lov'd a Man. Dim and remote the joys of saints I see; Nor envy them that heav'n I lose for thee. How oft', when prest to marriage, have I said, Curse on all laws but those which love has made? Love, free as air, at sight of human ties, Spreads his light wings, and in a moment flies. Let wealth, let honour, wait the wedded dame, August her deed, and sacred be her fame; Before true passion all those views remove, Fame, wealth, and honour! what are you to Love? The jealous God, when we profane his fires, Those restless passions in revenge inspires, And bids them make mistaken mortals groan, Who seek in love for ought but love alone. Should at my feet the world's great master fall, Himself, his throne, his world, I'd scorn 'em all: Not Cæsar's empress wou'd I deign to prove; No, make me mistress to the man I love; If there be yet another name, more free, More fond than mistress, make me that to thee! Oh happy state! when souls each other draw, When love is liberty, and nature, law: All then is full, possessing, and possess'd, No craving void left aking in the breast: Ev'n thought meets thought, e'er from the lips it part, And each warm wish springs mutual from the heart. This sure is bliss (if bliss on earth there be) And once the lot of Abelard and me. Alas how chang'd! what sudden horrors rise? A naked Lover bound and bleeding lies! Where, where was Eloïse? her voice, her hand, Her ponyard, had oppos'd the dire command. Barbarian stay! that bloody stroke restrain; The crime was common, common be the pain. I can no more; by shame, by rage suppress'd, Let tears, and burning blushes speak the rest. Canst thou forget that sad, that solemn day, When victims at yon' altar's foot we lay? Canst thou forget what tears that moment fell, When, warm in youth, I bade the world farewell? As with cold lips I kiss'd the sacred veil, The shrines all trembled, and the lamps grew pale: Heav'n scarce believ'd the conquest it survey'd, And Saints with wonder heard the vows I made. Yet then, to those dread altars as I drew, Not on the Cross my eyes were fix'd, but you: Not grace, or zeal, love only was my call, And if I lose thy love, I lose my all. Come! with thy looks, thy words, relieve my woe; Those still at least are left thee to bestow. Still on that breast enamour'd let me lie, Still drink delicious poison from thy eye, Pant on thy lip, and to thy heart be press'd; Give all thou canst—and let me dream the rest. Ah no! instruct me other joys to prize, With other beauties charm my partial eyes, Full in my view set all the bright abode, And make my soul quit Abelard for God. Ah think at least thy flock deserves thy care, Plants of thy hand, and children of thy pray'r. From the false world in early youth they fled, By thee to mountains, wilds, and deserts led. You He founded the Monastery. rais'd these hallow'd walls; the desert smil'd, And Paradise was open'd in the Wild. No weeping orphan saw his father's stores Our shrines irradiate, or emblaze the floors; No silver saints, by dying misers given, Here bribe'd the rage of ill-requited heav'n: But such plain roofs as Piety could raise, And only vocal with the Maker's praise. In these lone walls (their day's eternal bound) These moss-grown domes with spiry turrets crown'd, Where awful arches make a noon-day night, And the dim windows shed a solemn light; Thy eyes diffus'd a reconciling ray, And gleams of glory brighten'd all the day. But now no face divine contentment wears, 'Tis all blank sadness, or continual tears. See how the force of others pray'rs I try, (Oh pious fraud of am'rous charity!) But why should I on others pray'rs depend? Come thou, my father, brother, husband, friend! Ah let thy handmaid, sister, daughter move, And, all those tender names in one, thy love! The darksome pines that o'er yon' rocks reclin'd Wave high, and murmur to the hollow wind, The wand'ring streams that shine between the hills, The grots that echo to the tinkling rills, The dying gales that pant upon the trees, The lakes that quiver to the curling breeze; No more these scenes my meditation aid, Or lull to rest the visionary maid. But o'er the twilight groves, and dusky caves, Long-sounding isles, and intermingled graves, Black Melancholy sits, and round her throws A death-like silence, and a dread repose: Her gloomy presence saddens all the scene, Shades ev'ry flow'r, and darkens ev'ry green, Deepens the murmur of the falling floods, And breathes a browner horror on the woods. Yet here for ever, ever must I stay; Sad proof how well a lover can obey! Death, only death, can break the lasting chain; And here ev'n then, shall my cold dust remain, Here all its frailties, all its flames resign, And wait, 'till 'tis no sin to mix with thine. Ah wretch! believ'd the spouse of God in vain, Confess'd within the slave of love and man. Assist me heav'n! but whence arose that pray'r? Sprung it from piety, or from despair? Ev'n here, where frozen chastity retires, Love finds an altar for forbidden fires. I ought to grieve, but cannot what I ought; I mourn the lover, not lament the fault; I view my crime, but kindle at the view, Repent old pleasures, and sollicit new; Now turn'd to heav'n, I weep my past offence, Now think of thee, and curse my innocence. Of all affliction taught a lover yet, 'Tis sure the hardest science, to forget! How shall I lose the sin, yet keep the sense, And love th'offender, yet detest th'offence? How the dear object from the crime remove, Or how distinguish penitence from love? Unequal task! a passion to resign, For hearts so touch'd, so pierc'd, so lost as mine. E'er such a soul regains its peaceful state, How often must it love, how often hate! How often hope, despair, resent, regret, Conceal, disdain—do all things but forget. But let heav'n seize it, all at once 'tis fir'd, Not touch'd, but rapt; not waken'd, but inspir'd! Oh come! oh teach me nature to subdue, Renounce my love, my life, my self—and you. Fill my fond heart with God alone, for he Alone, can rival, can succeed to thee. How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot? The world forgetting, by the world forgot: Eternal sun-shine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd; Labour and rest, that equal periods keep; ‘Obedient slumbers that can wake and weep; Desires compos'd, affections ever even; Tears that delight, and sighs that waft to heav'n. Grace shines around her with serenest beams, And whisp'ring Angels prompt her golden dreams. For her the Spouse prepares the bridal ring, For her white virgins Hymenæals sing, For her th'unfading rose of Eden blooms, And wings of Seraphs shed divine perfumes, To sounds of heav'nly harps she dies away, And melts in visions of eternal day. Far other dreams my erring soul employ, Far other raptures, of unholy joy: When at the close of each sad, sorrowing day, Fancy restores what vengeance snatch'd away, Then conscience sleeps, and leaving nature free, All my loose soul unbounded springs to thee. O curst, dear horrors of all-conscious night! How glowing guilt exalts the keen delight! Provoking Dæmons all restraint remove, And stir within me ev'ry source of love. I hear thee, view thee, gaze o'er all thy charms, And round thy phantom glue my clasping arms. I wake:—no more I hear, no more I view, The phantom flies me, as unkind as you. I call aloud; it hears not what I say; I stretch my empty arms; it glides away. To dream once more I close my willing eyes; Ye soft illusions, dear deceits, arise! Alas, no more!—methinks we wand'ring go Thro' dreary wastes, and weep each other's woe, Where round some mould'ring tow'r pale ivy creeps, And low-brow'd rocks hang nodding o'er the deeps. Sudden you mount, you beckon from the skies; Clouds interpose, waves roar, and winds arise. I shriek, start up, the same sad prospect find, And wake to all the griefs I left behind. For thee the fates, severely kind, ordain A cool suspense from pleasure and from pain; Thy life a long, dead calm of fix'd repose; No pulse that riots, and no blood that glows. Still as the sea, e'er winds were taught to blow, Or moving spirit bade the waters flow; Soft as the slumbers of a saint forgiv'n, And mild as opening gleams of promis'd heav'n. Come Abelard! for what hast thou to dread? The torch of Venus burns not for the dead. Nature stands check'd; Religion disapproves; Ev'n thou art cold—yet Eloïsa loves. Ah hopeless, lasting flames! like those that burn To light the dead, and warm th'unfruitful urn. What scenes appear, where-e'er I turn my view, The dear Ideas where I fly, pursue, Rise in the grove, before the altar rise, Stain all my soul, and wanton in my eyes. I waste the Matin lamp in sighs for thee, Thy image steals between my God and me, Thy voice I seem in ev'ry hymn to hear, With ev'ry bead I drop too soft a tear. When from the censer clouds of fragrance roll, And swelling organs lift the rising soul, One thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight, Priests, tapers, temples, swim before my sight: In seas of flame my plunging soul is drown'd, While Altars blaze, and Angels tremble round. While prostrate here in humble grief I lie, Kind, virtuous drops just gath'ring in my eye, While praying, trembling, in the dust I roll, And dawning grace is opening on my soul: Come, if thou dar'st, all charming as thou art! Oppose thy self to heav'n; dispute my heart; Come, with one glance of those deluding eyes Blot out each bright Idea of the skies; Take back that grace, those sorrows, and those tears; Take back my fruitless penitence and pray'rs; Snatch me, just mounting, from the blest abode; Assist the fiends, and tear me from my God! No, fly me, fly me! far as Pole from Pole; Rise Alps between us! and whole oceans roll! Ah, come not, write not, think not once of me, Nor share one pang of all I felt for thee. Thy oaths I quit, thy memory resign; Forget, renounce me, hate whate'er was mine. Fair eyes, and tempting looks (which yet I view!) Long lov'd, ador'd ideas, all adieu! O grace serene! oh virtue heav'nly fair! Divine oblivion of low-thoughted care! Fresh blooming hope, gay daughter of the sky! And faith, our early immortality! Enter, each mild, each amicable guest; Receive, and wrap me in eternal rest! See in her cell sad Eloïsa spread, Propt on some tomb, a neighbour of the dead! In each low wind methinks a Spirit calls, And more than Echoes talk along the walls. Here, as I watch'd the dying lamps around, From yonder shrine I heard a hollow sound. ‘Come, sister, come! (it said, or seem'd to say) ‘Thy place is here, sad sister, come away! ‘Once like thy self, I trembled, wept, and pray'd, ‘Love's victim then, tho' now a sainted maid: ‘But all is calm in this eternal sleep; ‘Here grief forgets to groan, and love to weep, ‘Ev'n Superstition loses ev'ry fear: ‘For God, not man, absolves our frailties here.’ I come, I come! prepare your roseate bow'rs, Celestial palms, and ever-blooming flow'rs. Thither, where sinners may have rest, I go, Where flames refin'd in breasts seraphic glow: Thou, Abelard! the last sad office pay, And smooth my passage to the realms of day; See my lips tremble, and my eye-balls roll, Suck my last breath, and catch the flying soul! Ah no—in sacred vestments may'st thou stand, The hallow'd taper trembling in thy hand, Present the Cross before my lifted eye, Teach me at once, and learn of me to die. Ah then, thy once lov'd Eloïsa see! It will be then no crime to gaze on me. See from my cheek the transient roses fly! See the last sparkle languish in my eye! 'Till ev'ry motion, pulse, and breath, be o'er; And ev'n my Abelard belov'd no more. O Death all-eloquent! you only prove What dust we doat on, when 'tis man we love. Then too, when fate shall thy fair frame destroy, (That cause of all my guilt, and all my joy) In trance extatic may thy pangs be drown'd, Bright clouds descend, and Angels watch thee round, From opening skies may streaming glories shine, And Saints embrace thee with a love like mine. May Abelard and Eloïsa were interr'd in the same grave, or in monuments adjoining, in the Monastery of the Paraclete: He died in the year 1142, she in 1163. one kind grave unite each hapless name, And graft my love immortal on thy fame! Then, ages hence, when all my woes are o'er, When this rebellious heart shall beat no more; If ever chance two wand'ring lovers brings To Paraclete's white walls and silver springs, O'er the pale marble shall they join their heads, And drink the falling tears each other sheds; Then sadly say, with mutual pity mov'd, “Oh may we never love as these have lov'd! From the full quire when loud Hosanna's rise, And swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice, Amid that scene, if some relenting eye Glance on the stone where our cold relicks lie, Devotion's self shall steal a thought from heav'n, One human tear shall drop, and be forgiv'n. And sure if fate some future bard shall join In sad similitude of griefs to mine, Condemn'd whole years in absence to deplore, And image charms he must behold no more; Such if there be, who loves so long, so well; Let him our sad, our tender story tell; The well-sung woes will sooth my pensive ghost; He best can paint 'em, who shall feel 'em most. ELEGY To the Memory of an UNFORTUNATE LADY. What beck'ning ghost, along the moonlight shade Invites my step, and points to yonder glade? 'Tis she!—but why that bleeding bosom gor'd, Why dimly gleams the visionary sword? Oh ever beauteous, ever friendly! tell, Is it, in heav'n, a crime to love too well? To bear too tender, or too firm a heart, To act a Lover's or a Roman's part? Is there no bright reversion in the sky, For those who greatly think, or bravely die? Why bad ye else, ye Pow'rs! her soul aspire Above the vulgar flight of low desire? Ambition first sprung from your blest abodes; The glorious fault of Angels and of Gods: Thence to their images on earth it flows, And in the breasts of Kings and Heroes glows! Most souls, 'tis true, but peep out once an age, Dull sullen pris'ners in the body's cage: Dim lights of life that burn a length of years, Useless, unseen, as lamps in sepulchres; Like Eastern Kings a lazy state they keep, And close confin'd in their own palace sleep. From these perhaps (e'er nature bade her die) Fate snatch'd her early to the pitying sky. As into air the purer spirits flow, And sep'rate from their kindred dregs below; So flew the soul to its congenial place, Nor left one virtue to redeem her Race. But thou, false guardian of a charge too good, Thou, mean deserter of thy brother's blood! See on these ruby lips the trembling breath, These cheeks, now fading at the blast of death; Cold is that breast which warm'd the world before, And those love-darting eyes must roll no more. Thus, if Eternal justice rules the ball, Thus shall your wives, and thus your children fall: On all the line a sudden vengeance waits, And frequent herses shall besiege your gates. There passengers shall stand, and pointing say, (While the long fun'rals blacken all the way) Lo these were they, whose souls the Furies steel'd, And curs'd with hearts unknowing how to yield. Thus unlamented pass the proud away, The gaze of fools, and pageant of a day! So perish all, whose breast ne'er learn'd to glow For others good, or melt at others woe. What can atone (oh ever-injur'd shade!) Thy fate unpity'd, and thy rites unpaid? No friend's complaint, no kind domestic tear Pleas'd thy pale ghost, or grac'd thy mournful bier. By foreign hands thy dying eyes were clos'd, By foreign hands thy decent limbs compos'd, By foreign hands thy humble grave adorn'd, By strangers honour'd, and by strangers mourn'd! What tho' no friends in sable weeds appear, Grieve for an hour, perhaps, then mourn a year, And bear about the mockery of woe To midnight dances, and the publick show? What tho' no weeping Loves thy ashes grace, Nor polish'd marble emulate thy face? What tho' no sacred earth allow thee room, Nor hallow'd dirge be mutter'd o'er thy tomb? Yet shall thy grave with rising flow'rs be drest, And the green turf lie lightly on thy breast: There shall the Morn her earliest tears bestow, There the first roses of the year shall blow; While Angels with their silver wings o'ershade The ground, now sacred by thy reliques made. So peaceful rests, without a stone, a name, What once had beauty, titles, wealth, and fame. How lov'd, how honour'd once, avails thee not, To whom related, or by whom begot; A heap of dust alone remains of thee, 'Tis all thou art, and all the proud shall be! Poets themselves must fall, like those they sung, Deaf the prais'd ear, and mute the tuneful tongue. Ev'n he, whose soul now melts in mournful lays, Shall shortly want the gen'rous tear he pays; Then from his closing eyes thy form shall part, And the last pang shall tear thee from his heart, Life's idle business at one gasp be o'er, The Muse forgot, and thou belov'd no more! PROLOGUE TO Mr. ADDISON's Tragedy OF CATO. To wake the soul by tender strokes of art, To raise the genius, and to mend the heart; To make mankind, in conscious virtue bold, Live o'er each scene, and be what they behold: For this the Tragic Muse first trod the stage, Commanding tears to stream thro' ev'ry age; Tyrants no more their savage nature kept, And foes to virtue wonder'd how they wept. Our author shuns by vulgar springs to move, The hero's glory, or the virgin's love; In pitying Love, we but our weakness show, And wild Ambition well deserves its woe. Here tears shall flow from a more gen'rous cause, Such Tears as Patriots shed for dying Laws: He bids your breasts with ancient ardour rise, And calls forth Roman drops from British eyes. Virtue confess'd in human shape he draws, What Plato thought, and godlike Cato was: No common object to your sight displays, But what with pleasure Heav'n itself surveys, A brave man struggling in the storms of fate, And greatly falling with a falling state. While Cato gives his little Senate laws, What bosom beats not in his Country's cause? Who sees him act, but envies ev'ry deed? Who hears him groan, and does not wish to bleed? E'vn when proud Cæsar 'midst triumphal cars, The spoils of nations, and the pomp of wars, Ignobly vain and impotently great, Show'd Rome her Cato's figure drawn in state; As her dead Father's rev'rend image past, The pomp was darken'd, and the day o'ercast; The Triumph ceas'd, tears gush'd from ev'ry eye; The World's great Victor pass'd unheeded by; Her last good man dejected Rome ador'd, And honour'd Cæsar's less than Cato's sword. Britons attend: be worth like this approv'd, And show, you have the virtue to be mov'd. With honest scorn the first fam'd Cato view'd Rome learning arts from Greece, whom she subdu'd; Our scene precariously subsists too long On French translation, and Italian song. Dare to have sense your selves; assert the stage, Be justly warm'd with your own native rage: Such Plays alone should please a British ear, As Cato's self had not disdain'd to hear. EPILOGUE TO Mr. Rowe's JANESHORE, Design'd for Mrs. Oldfield. Prodigious this! the Frail-one of our play From her own Sex should mercy find to-day! You might have held the pretty head aside, Peep'd in your fans, been serious, thus, and cry'd, The Play may pass—but that strange creature, Shore, I can't—indeed now—I so hate a whore— Just as a blockhead rubs his thoughtless skull, And thanks his stars he was not born a fool; So from a sister sinner you shall hear, “How strangely you expose your self, my dear?” But let me die, all raillery apart, Our sex are still forgiving at their heart; And did not wicked custom so contrive, We'd be the best, good-natur'd things alive. There are, 'tis true, who tell another tale, That virtuous ladies envy while they rail: Such rage without betrays the fire within; In some close corner of the soul, they sin, Still hoarding up, most scandalously nice, Amidst their virtues a reserve of vice. The godly dame, who fleshly failings damns, Scolds with her maid, or with her chaplain crams. Wou'd you enjoy soft nights and solid dinners? Faith, gallants, board with saints, and bed with sinners. Well, if our Author in the Wife offends, He has a Husband that will make amends: He draws him gentle, tender, and forgiving, And sure such kind good creatures may be living. In days of old, they pardon'd breach of vows, Stern Cato's self was no relentless spouse: Plu—Plutarch, what's his name, that writes his life? Tells us, that Cato dearly lov'd his wife: Yet if a friend, a night or so, should need her, He'd recommend her, as a special breeder. To lend a wife, few here would scruple make, But pray which of you all would take her back? Tho' with the Stoick Chief our stage may ring, The Stoick Husband was the glorious thing. The man had courage, was a sage, 'tis true, And lov'd his country—but what's that to you? Those strange examples ne'er were made to fit ye, But the kind cuckold might instruct the City: There, many an honest man may copy Cato, Who ne'er saw naked sword, or look'd in Plato. If, after all, you think it a disgrace, That Edward's Miss thus perks it in your face; To see a piece of failing flesh and blood, In all the rest so impudently good; Faith, let the modest Matrons of the town, Come here in crouds, and stare the strumpet down. The END of the First Volume.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. Containing his EPISTLES and SATIRES. AN ESSAY on MAN, Being the First Book of ETHIC EPISTLES. TO HENRY St. JOHN L. BOLINGBROKE. Written in the Year 1732. THE DESIGN. Having proposed to write some pieces on Human Life and Manners, such as (to use my Lord Bacon's expression) come home to Men's business and bosoms, I thought it more satisfactory to begin with considering Man in the Abstract, his Nature and his State: since to prove any moral Duty, to enforce any moral Precept, or to examine the Perfection or Imperfection of any Creature whatsoever, it is necessary first to know what condition and relation it is placed in, and what is the proper end and purpose of its Being. The Science of Human Nature is, like all other Sciences, reduced to a few, clear points: There are not many certain Truths in this World. It is therefore in the Anatomy of the Mind, as in that of the Body; more good will accrue to mankind by attending to the large, open, and perceptible parts, than by studying too much such finer nerves and vessels as will for ever escape our observation. The Disputes are all upon these last, and I will venture to say, they have less sharpen'd the Wits than the Hearts of Men against each other, and have diminish'd the Practice, more than advanced the Theory, of Morality. If I could flatter myself that this Essay has any merit, it is in steering betwixt Doctrines seemingly opposite, in passing over Terms utterly unintelligible, and in forming out of all, a temperate yet not inconsistent, and a short yet not imperfect System of Ethics. This I might have done in Prose; but I chose Verse, and even Rhyme, for two reasons. The one will appear obvious; that Principles, maxims, or precepts so written, both strike the reader more strongly at first, and are more easily retain'd by him afterwards. The other may seem odd, but is true; I found I could express them more shortly this way than in Prose it self; and nothing is truer than that much of the Force as well as Grace of Arguments or Instructions depends on their Conciseness. I was unable to treat this part of my subject more in detail, without becoming dry and tedious: or more poetically, without sacrificing Perspicuity to Ornament, without wandring from the Precision, or breaking the Chain of Reasoning. If any man can unite all these without diminution of any of them, I freely confess he will compass a thing above my capacity. What is now publish'd, is only to be considered as a general Map of Man, marking out no more than the Greater Parts, their Extents, their Limits, and their Connection, but leaving the particular to be more fully delineated in the Charts which are to follow. Consequently these Epistles in their progress (if I have health and leisure to make any progress) will become less dry, and more susceptible of Ornament. I am here only opening the Fountains and clearing the passage; To deduce the Rivers, to follow them in their course, and to observe their effects, would be a task more agreeable. THE CONTENTS. EPISTLE I. Of the Nature and State of Man, with respect to the Universe. Of Man, in the Abstract.—That we can judge only with regard to our own System, being ignorant of the Relations of Systems and Things, Ver. 17, &amp;c. to 69. That Man is not to be deemed Imperfect, but a Being suited to his Place and Rank in the Creation, agreeable to the General Order of things, and conformable to Ends and Relations to him unknown, 69, &amp;c. That it is partly upon his Ignorance of future Events, and partly upon the Hope of a Future State, that all his Happiness in the present depends, 73, &amp;c. The Pride of aiming at more Knowledge, and pretending to more Perfection, the cause of man's Error and Misery. The impiety of putting himself in the Place of God, and judging of the fitness or unfitness, perfection or imperfection, justice or injustice of his dispensations, 109 to 120. The Absurdity of conceiting himself the final Cause of the Creation, or expecting that Perfection in the moral world which is not in the natural, 127 to 164. The Unreasonableness of his complaints against Providence, while on the one hand he demands the perfections of the Angels, on the other the bodily qualifications of the Brutes, 165. That to possess any of the sensitive faculties in a higher degree, would render him miserable, 181 to 198. That throughout the whole visible world, an universal Order and Gradation in the sensual and mental Faculties is observed, which causes a subordination of creature to creature, and of all creatures to man. The gradations of sense, instinct, thought, reflection, reason; that Reason alone countervails all the other faculties, 199 to 224. How much farther this Order and subordination of living creatures may extend, above and below us? were any part of which broken, not that part only, but the whole connected Creation must be destroyed. The Extravagance, Madness, and Pride of such a desire, 225 to 260. The Consequence of all, the absolute Submission due to Providence, both as to our Present and future state, 273, &amp;c. EPISTLE II. Of the Nature and State of Man, with respect to Himself as an Individual. The business of Man not to pry into God, but to study himself. His Middle Nature; his Powers and Frailties, and the Limits of his Capacity. 43. The two Principles of Man, Self-love and Reason, both necessary; Self-love the Stronger, and why? their End the same, 83. The Passions, and their Use, 83, to 120. The Predominant Passion, and its force, 122 to 150. its necessity, in directing men to different purposes, 153, &amp;c. its providential use, in fixing our principle and ascertaining our virtue, 167. Virtue and Vice joined in our mixt nature; the limits near, yet the things separate, and evident. What is the office of Reason? 187, &amp;c. How odious Vice in itself, and how we deceive ourselves into it, 209. That however, the Ends of Providence and general Good are answered in our Passions, and Imperfections, 230, &amp;c. How usefully they are distributed to all Orders of Men, 233. how useful they are to Society, 241. and to the Individuals, 253. In every State, and in every Age of life, 263. &amp;c.EPISTLE III. Of the Nature and State of Man, with respect to Society. The whole Universe one System of Society, Ver. 7. &amp;c. Nothing is made wholly for itself, nor yet wholly for another, 27. The happiness of Animals mutual, 53. Reason or Instinct operate alike to the good of each Individual, 83. Reason or Instinct operate also to Society, in all animals, 109. How far Society, carry'd by Instinct. 119. how much farther by Reason, 132. Of that which is called the State of Nature. 148. Reason instructed by Instinct in the invention of Arts, 150 and in the Forms of Society, 180. Origin of political Societies, 199. Origin of Monarchy, 211. Patriarchal government, 216. Origin of true Religion and Government, from the same principle, of Love. 235, &amp;c. Origin of Superstition and Tyranny, from the same principle, of Fear, 241, &amp;c. The influence of Self-love operating to the social and publick good, 269. Restoration of true Religion and Government on their first principle, 285. Mixt Government, 289. Various Forms of each, and the true End of all. 303. &amp;c.EPISTLE IV. Of the Nature and State of Man, with respect to Happiness. Happiness ill defined by the Philosophers, Ver. 19. That it is the End of all men, and attainable by all, 28. God governs by general, not particular Laws: intends Happiness to be equal; and to be so it must be social, since all particular happiness depends on general, 35. As it is necessary for Order, and the peace and welfare of Society, that External goods should be unequal. Happiness is not made to consist in these, 47. But, notwithstanding that inequality, the Balance of Happiness among mankind is kept even by Providence, by the two Passions of Hope and Fear, 66. What the happiness of Individuals is, as far as is consistent with the Constitution of this World: and that the good man has here the Advantage, 76. The error of imputing to Virtue what are only the calamities of Nature, or of Fortune, 92. The folly of expecting God should alter his General Laws in favour of particulars, 118. That we are not judges who are good? but that whoever they are, they must be happiest, 130, &amp;c. That external goods are not the proper rewards, but often inconsistent with, or destructive of Virtue, 166. That even these can make no man happy without Virtue. Instanced in Riches, 176. Honours, 184. Birth, 203. Greatness, 213. Fame, 233. Superior Talents, 257. with Pictures of human Infelicity in men possest of them all, 275, &amp;c. That Virtue only constitutes a Happiness, whose Object is Universal, and whose Prospect Eternal, 304, &amp;c. That the Perfection of Virtue and Happiness consists in a Conformity to the Order of Providence here, and a Resignation to it here, and hereafter, 326, &amp;c. EPISTLE I. Awake! my St. John! leave all meaner things To low ambition and the pride of Kings. Let us (since Life can little more supply Than just to look about us and to die) Expatiate free o'er all this scene of Man: A mighty maze! but not without a plan; A wild, where weeds and flow'rs promiscuous shoot, Or garden, tempting with forbidden fruit. Together let us beat this ample field, Try what the open, what the covert yield, The latent tracts, the giddy heights explore Of all who blindly creep, or sightless soar, Eye Nature's walks, shoot folly as it flies, And catch the manners living as they rise, Laugh where we must, be candid where we can, But vindicate the ways of God to man. Of the Nature and State of Man with respect to the Universe. V. 17. &amp;c.] He can reason only from Things known, and judge only with regard to his own System.Say first, of God above, or Man below, What can we reason, but from what we know? Of Man, what see we but his Station here, From which to reason, or to which refer? Thro' worlds unnumber'd tho' the God be known, 'Tis ours to trace him, only in our own. He who thro' vast immensity can pierce, See worlds on worlds compose one universe, Observe how system into system runs, What other plannets and what other suns? What vary'd being peoples ev'ry star? May tell, why heav'n made all things as they are. But of this frame the bearings, and the ties, The strong connections, nice dependencies, Gradations just, has thy pervading soul Look'd thro'? or can a part contain the whole? Is the great Chain that draws all to agree, And drawn supports, upheld by God, or thee? Presumptuous man! the reason wouldst thou find Ver. 36, &amp;c.] He is not therefore a Judge of his own perfection or imperfection, but is certainly such a Being as is suited to his Place and Rank in the Creation.Why form'd so weak, so little and so blind? First, if thou canst, the harder reason guess Why form'd no weaker, blinder, and no less? Ask of thy mother earth, why oaks are made Taller or stronger than the weeds they shade? Or ask of yonder argent fields above, Why Jove's Satellites are less than Jove? Of Systems possible, if 'tis confest That Wisdom infinite must form the best, Where all must full or not coherent be, And all that rises, rise in due degree; Then, in the scale of life and sense, 'tis plain There must be, some where, such a rank as Man; And all the question (wrangle 'ere so long) Is only this, if God has plac'd him wrong? Respecting man whatever wrong we call, May, must be right, as relative to all. In human works though labour'd on with pain, A thousand movements scarce one purpose gain; In God's, one single can its end produce, Yet serves to second too some other use. So man, who here seems principal alone, Perhaps acts second to some sphere unknown, Touches some wheel, or verges to some gole; 'Tis but a part we see, and not a whole. When the proud steed shall know, why man restrains His fiery course, or drives him o'er the plains; When the dull ox, why now he breaks the clod, Now wears a Garland, an Ægyptian god; Then shall man's pride and dulness comprehend His action's, passion's, being's, use and end; Why doing suff'ring, check'd, impell'd; and why This hour a slave, the next a deity? Then say not Man's imperfect, Heav'n in fault; Say rather, man's as perfect as he ought; His being measur'd to his state and place, His time a moment, and a point his space. Ver. 73.] His happiness depends on his Ignorance to a certain degree.Heav'n from all creatures hides the book of fate, All but the page prescrib'd, their present state, Ver. 75, &amp;c.] See this pursued in Epist. 3. vers. 70, &amp;c. 83, &amp;c.From brutes what men, from men what spirits know, Or who could suffer Being here below? The Lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to day, Had he thy reason, would he skip and play? Pleas'd to the last, he crops the flow'ry food, And licks the hand just rais'd to shed his blood. Oh blindness to the future! kindly giv'n, That each may fill the circle mark'd by heav'n, Who sees with equal eye, as God of all, A hero perish or a sparrow fall, Atoms, or Systems, into ruin hurl'd, And now a bubble burst, and now a world! Ver. 87.]—And on his Hope of a Relation to a future State.Hope humbly then; with trembling pinions soar; Wait the great teacher, Death, and God adore! What future bliss, he gives not thee to know, Ver. 90.] Further open'd in Epist. 2. vers. 265.—Epist. 3. vers. 78.—Epist. 4. vers. 336, &amp;c.But gives that Hope to be thy blessing now. Hope springs eternal in the human breast; Man never is, but always to be blest; The soul uneasy, and confin'd at home, Rests, and expatiates, in a life to come. Lo! the poor Indian, whose untutor'd mind Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind; His soul, proud science never taught to stray Far as the solar walk, or milky way: Yet simple nature to his hope has giv'n Behind the cloud-topt hill, an humbler heav'n, Some safer world, in depth of woods embrac'd, Some happier island in the watry waste, Where slaves once more their native land behold, No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold, To be, contents his natural desire, He asks no angel's wing, nor seraph's fire, But thinks, admitted to that equal sky, His faithful dog shall bear him company. Ver. 109.] The Pride of aiming at more Knowledge and Perfection, and the Impiety of pretending to judge of the Dispensations of Providence, the causes of his Error and Misery.Go, wiser thou! and in thy scale of sense Weigh thy Opinion against Providence: Call Imperfection what thou fancy'st such, Say, here he gives too little there too much; Destroy all creatures for thy sport or gust, Yet cry, if man's unhappy, Gods unjust, If man, alone engross not heav'n's high care, Alone made perfect here, immortal there; Snatch from his hand the balance and the rod, Re-judge his justice, be the God of God! In reas'ning Pride (my friend) our error lies; All quit their sphere, and rush into the skies. Pride still is aiming at the blest abodes, Men would be Angels, Angels would be Gods. Aspiring to be Gods, if angels fell, Aspiring to be angels, men rebel: And who but wishes to invert the laws Of Order, sins against th'Eternal Cause. Ver. 127.] The Absurdity of conceiting himself the Final Cause of the Creation, or expecting that Perfection in the moral world which is not in the natural.Ask for what end the heav'nly bodies shine? Earth for whose use? Pride answers, “'Tis for mine: “For me kind Nature wakes her genial pow'r, “Suckles each herb, and spreads out every flow'r; “Annual for me, the grape, the rose renew “The juice nectareous, and the balmy dew; “For me, the mine a thousand treasures brings; “For me, health gushes from a thousand springs; “Seas roll to waft me, suns to light me rise: “My footstool earth, my canopy the skies. But errs not Nature from this gracions end, From burning suns when livid deaths descend, When earthquakes swallow, or when tempests sweep Towns to one grave, or nations to the deep? No ('tis reply'd) the first Almighty Cause “Acts not by partial, but by gen'ral laws; “Th'exceptions few; some change since all began, “And what created perfect?” Why then Man? If the great end be human happiness, Then Nature deviates, and can Man do less? As much that end a constant course requires Of show'rs and sunshine, as of man's desires, As much eternal springs and cloudless skies, As men for ever temp'rate, calm, and wise. If plagues or earthquakes break not heav'n's design, Why then a Borgia or a Catiline? From pride, from pride, our very reas'ning springs? Account for moral, as for nat'ral things: Why charge we heav'n in those, in these acquit? In both, to reason right, is to submit. Better for Us, perhaps, it might appear, Were there all harmony, all virtue here; That never air or ocean felt the wind; That never passion discompos'd the mind: But All subsists by elemental strife; Ver. 162.] See this subject extended in Epist. 2. from vers. 90, to 112, 155, &amp;c.And Passions are the Elements of life. The gen'ral Order, since the whole began Is kept in Nature, and is kept in Man. What would this man? now upward will he soar, Ver. 166.] The unreasonableness of the Complaints against Providence, and that to possess more Faculties would make us miserable.And little less than Angel, would be more; Now looking downward, just as griev'd appears. To want the strength of bulls, the fur of bears. Made for his use all creatures if he call, Say what their use, had he the pow'rs of all? Nature to these, without profusion kind, The proper organs, proper pow'rs assign'd; Each seeming want compensated of course Ver. 174. Here, with degrees of swiftness, there of force.] It is a certain axiom in the Anatomy of creatures, that in proportion as they are form'd for strength, their swiftness is lessen'd; or as they are form'd for swiftness, their strength is abated.Here, with degrees of swiftness, there, of force; All in exact proportion to the state, Nothing to add, and nothing to abate. Ver. 177.] Vid. Epist. 3. vers. 83, &amp;c. and 110, &amp;c.Each beast, each insect, happy in its own, Is heav'n unkind to man, and man alone? Shall he alone whom rational we call, Be pleas'd with nothing, if not bless'd with all? The bliss of man (could pride that blessing find) Is, not to act, or think, beyond mankind; No pow'rs of body or of soul to share; But what his nature and his state can bare. Why has not man a microscopic eye? For this plain reason, man is not a fly. Say what the use, were finer optics giv'n, T'inspect a mite, not comprehend the heav'n? The touch, if tremblingly alive all o'er, To smart and agonize at ev'ry pore? Or quick effluvia darting thro' the brain, Dye of a rose in aromatic pain? If nature thunder'd in his opening ears, And stunn'd him with the musick of the spheres, How would he wish, that heav'n had left him still The whispering zephyr, and the purling rill? Who finds not Providence all-good and wise, Alike in what it gives and what denies? Far as Creation's ample range extends, Ver. 200.] There is an universal Order and Gradation thro' the whole visible world, of the sensible and mental Faculties, which causes the Subordination of Creature to Creature, and of all Creatures to Man, whose Reason alone countervails all the other Faculties.The scale of sensual, mental pow'rs ascends: Mark how it mounts, to man's imperial race From the green myriads in the peopled grass! What modes of sight, betwixt each wide extreme, The mole's dim curtain, and the lynx's beam: Ver. 205.—the headlong Lioness—The manner of the Lions hunting their prey in the deserts of Africa is this; at their first going out in the night-time they set up a loud roar, and then listen to the noise made by the Beasts in their flight, pursuing them by the ear, and not by the nostril. It is probable, the story of the Jackall's hunting for the Lion was occasion'd by observing the defect of Scent in that terrible Animal.Of smell, the headlong lioness between, And hound sagacious on the tainted green: Of hearing, from the life that fills the flood, To that which warbles thro' the vernal wood: The spider's touch, how exquisitely fine, Feels at each thread, and lives along the line: In the nice bee, what sense so subtly true From pois'nous herbs extracts the healing dew. How Instinct varies, in the groveling swine, Compar'd, half reas'ning elephant! with thine; 'Twixt that, and Reason, what a nice barrier, For ever sep'rate, yet for ever near; Remembrance and Reflection, how ally'd; What thin partitions Sense from Thought divide: And Middle natures, how they long to join, Yet never pass th'insuperable line! Without this just Gradation could they be Subjected these to those, or all to thee? The pow'rs of all subdu'd by thee alone, Is not thy reason all those pow'rs in one? Ver. 225.] How much farther this Gradation and Subordination may extend? were any part of which broken, the whole connected Creation must be destroy'd.See, thro' this air, this ocean, and this earth, All matter quick, and bursting into birth. Above, how high progressive life may go? Around how wide? how deep extend below? Vast chain of Being! which from God began, Natures æthereal, human, angel, man, Beast, bird, fish, insect! what no eye can see, No glass can reach! from infinite to thee, From thee to Nothing! On superior pow'rs Were we to press, inferior might on ours: Or in the full creation leave a Void, Where one step broken the great scale's destroy'd; From nature's chain whatever link you strike, Tenth or ten thousandth, breaks the chain alike. And if each System in gradation roll, Alike essential to th'amazing whole; The least confusion but in one, not all That System only, but the whole must fall. Let Earth unbalanc'd from her orbit fly, Planets and suns rush lawless thro' the sky, Let ruling Angels from their spheres be hurl'd, Being on being wreck'd, and world on world, Heav'n's whole foundations to their centre nod, And Nature tremble, to the throne of God! All this dread Order break!—For whom? For thee? Ver. 250.] The Extravagance, Impiety, and Pride of such a desire.Vile worm!—O Madness! Pride! Impiety! What if the foot, ordain'd the dust to tread, Or hand to toil, aspir'd to be the head? What if the head, the eye or ear repin'd To serve mere engines to the ruling Mind? Just as absurd, for any part to claim To be another in this gen'ral frame: Ver. 257.] Vid. the prosecution and application of this in Epist. 4. ver 160.Just as absurd, to mourn the task or pains, The great directing Mind of All ordains. All are but parts of one stupendous whole, Whose body Nature is, and God the soul; That, chang'd thro' all, and yet in all the same, Great in the earth as in the æthereal frame, Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze, Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees, Lives thro' all life, extends thro' all extent, Spreads undivided, operates unspent, Breaths in our soul, informs our mortal part, As full, as perfect, in a hair as heart, As full, as perfect in vile man that mourns, As the rapt Seraph that adores and burns; To him, no high, no low, no great, no small: He fills, he bounds; connects, and equals all. Ver. 273.] The Consequence of all, the absolute Submission due to Providence, both as to our present and future State.Cease then, nor Order Imperfection name: Our proper bliss depends on what we blame. Know thy own point: this kind, this due degree Of blindness, weakness, heav'n bestows on thee. Submit—in this, or any other sphere, Secure to be as blest as thou canst bear: Safe in the hand of one disposing Pow'r, Or in the natal, or the mortal hour. All nature is but art, unknown to thee; All chance, direction which thou canst not see: All discord, harmony not understood: All partial evil, universal good: And spight of pride, in erring reason's spight, One truth is clear; Whatever Is, is Right.” EPISTLE II. Of the Nature and State of Man as an Individual. The business of Man not to pry into God, but to study himself. His Middle Nature, his Power, Frailties, and the Limits of his Capacity. Know then thy self, presume not God to scan; The proper study of mankind is Man. Plac'd on this Isthmus of a middle state, A being darkly wise, and rudely great: With too much knowledge for the Sceptic side, With too much weakness for the Stoic's pride, He hangs between; in doubt to act, or rest, In doubt to deem himself a God, or beast; In doubt, his mind or body to prefer, Born but to die, and reas'ning but to err; Alike in ignorance, his reason such, Whether he thinks too little, or too much: Chaos of thought and passion, all confus'd; Still by himself abus'd, or disabus'd; Created half to rise, and half to fall; Great Lord of all things, yet a prey to all; Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurl'd: The glory, jest, and riddle, of the world! Go wondrous creature! mount where Science guides, Go measure earth, weigh air, and state the tides, Show by what laws the wandring Planets stray, Correct old Time, and teach the Sun his way. Go soar with Plato to th'empyreal sphere, To the first good, first perfect, and first fair; Or tread the mazy round his follow'rs trod, And quitting sense call imitating God; As eastern priests in giddy circles run, And turn their heads to imitate the Sun. Go teach Eternal Wisdom how to rule— Then drop into thyself, and be a fool! Superior Beings, when of late they saw A mortal man unfold all Nature's law, Admir'd such wisdom in an earthly shape, And shew'd a Newton as we show an Ape. Could he, whose rules the whirling Comet bind, Describe, or fix, one movement of the Mind? Who saw the Stars here rise, and there descend, Explain his own beginning, or his end? Alas what wonder! Man's superior part? Uncheck'd may rise, and climb from Art to art; But when his own great work is but begun, What Reason waves, by Passion is undone. Ver. 43.] The Two Principles of Man, Self-love and Reason, both Necessary, 49. Self love the stronger, and why? 57. their End the same, 71.Two Principles in human nature reign; Self-love, to urge, and Reason, to restrain; Nor this a good nor that a bad we call, Each works its end, to move, or govern all: And to their proper operation still Ascribe all Good, to their improper, Ill. Self-Love, the spring of motion, acts the soul: Reason's comparing balance rules the whole. Man but for that, no action could attend, And but for this, were active to no end, Fix'd like a plant on his peculiar spot, To draw nutrition, propagate, and rot; Or meteor-like, flame lawless thro' the void, Destroying others, by himself destroy'd. Most strength the moving Principle requires; Active its task, it prompts, impels, inspires: Sedate and quiet the comparing lies, Form'd but to check, delib'rate, and advise. Self-love still stronger, as its objects nigh; Reason's at distance, and in prospect lie; That sees immediate good, by present sense, Reason the future, and the consequence; Thicker than arguments, temptations throng, At best more watchful this, but that more strong. The action of the stronger to suspend, Reason still use, to reason still attend: Attention, habit and experience gains, Each strengthens Reason, and Self-love restrains. Let subtile Schoolmen teach these friends to fight, More studious to divide, than to unite, And grace and virtue, sense and reason split, With all the rash dexterity of wit. Wits, just like fools, at war about a name, Have full as oft, no meaning, or the same. Self-love and Reason to one end aspire, Pain their aversion, pleasure their desire: But greedy that its object would devour, This taste the honey, and not wound the flower: Pleasure, or wrong or rightly understood, Our greatest evil, or our greatest good. Ver. 83.] The Passions, and their Use. Modes of Self love the Passions we may call; 'Tis real good, or seeming, moves them all: But since not every good we can divide, And reason bids us for our own provide; Passions tho' selfish, if their means be fair, List under Reason, and deserve her care: Those that imparted, court a nobler aim, Exalt their kind, and take some Virtue's name. In lazy Apathy let Stoics boast Their virtue fix'd; 'tis fix'd as in a frost, Contracted all, retiring to the breast; But strength of mind is exercise, not rest: The rising tempest puts in act the soul, Parts it may ravage, but preserves the whole. On Life's vast ocean diversely we sail, Reason the card, but Passion is the gale: Nor God alone in the still calm we find; He mounts the storm, and walks upon the Wind. Passions, like Elements, tho' born to fight, Yet mix'd and softned, in his work unite: These, 'tis enough to temper and employ; But what composes man, can man destroy? Suffice that Reason keep to Nature's road, Subject, compound them, follow her and God. Love, hope, and joy, fair pleasure's smiling train, Hate, fear, and grief, the family of pain, These mix'd with art, and to due bounds confin'd, Make, and maintain, the balance of the mind: The lights and shades, whose well-accorded strife Gives all the strength and colour of our life. Pleasures are ever in our hands or eyes, And when in act they cease, in prospect rise; Present to grasp, and future still to find, The whole employ of body and of mind. All spread their charms, but charm not all alike, On diff'rent Senses diff'rent objects strike; Hence diff'rent Passions more or less inflame, As strong, or weak, the organs of the frame; And hence one Master Passion in the breast, Ver. 122, &amp;c.] The Predominant Passion, and its Force. The Use of this doctrine, as apply'd to the Knowledge of mankind, is one of the subjects of the second book.Like Aaron's serpent, swallows up the rest. As man, perhaps, the moment of his breath, Receives the lurking principle of death; The young disease that must subdue at length, Grows with his growth, and strengthens with his strength: So, cast and mingled with his very frame, The mind's disease, its ruling passion came: Each vital humour which should feed the whole, Soon flows to this, in body and in soul; Whatever warms the heart, or fills the head, As the mind opens, and its functions spread, Imagination plies her dang'rous art, And pours it all upon the peccant part. Nature its mother, Habit is its nurse; Wit, spirit, faculties, but make it worse; Reason itself but gives it edge and pow'r, As heav'n's blest beam turns vinegar more sow'r; We, wretched subjects tho' to lawful sway, In this weak Queen, some Fav'rite still obey. Ah! if she lend not arms as well as rules, What can she more, than tell us we are fools? Teach us to mourn our nature, not to mend, A sharp accuser but a helpless friend! Or from a judge, turn pleader, to persuade The choice we make, or justify it made: Proud of an easy conquest all along. She but removes weak passions for the strong; So, when small humours gather to a gout, The Doctor fancies he has driv'n 'em out. Yes, Natures road must ever be prefer'd; Reason is here no guide, but still a guard; 'Tis her's to rectify, not overthrow, And treat this passion more as friend than foe: Ver. 155.] Its Necessity, in directing men to different purposes. The particular application of this to the several Pursuits of Men, and the General Good resulting thence, falls also into the succeeding books.A mightier Pow'r the strong direction sends, And sev'ral men impells to sev'ral Ends. Like varying winds, by other passions tost, This drives them constant to a certain coast. Let Pow'r or Knowledge, Gold or Glory please. Or (oft more strong than all) the love of Ease: Thro' life 'tis follow'd, ev'n at life's expence: The merchant's toil, the sage's indolence, The monk's humility, the hero's pride, All, all alike, find Reason on their side. Ver. 165.] Its providential use, in fixing our Principle, and ascertaining our Virtue.Th'Eternal Art, educing good from ill, Grafts on this Passion our best Principle; 'Tis thus, the Mercury of man is fix'd, Strong grows the virtue with his nature mix'd, The dross cements what else were too refin'd, And in one int'rest Body acts with Mind. As fruits ungrateful to the planter's care, On savage stocks inserted, learn to bear; The surest virtues thus from passions shoot, Wild nature's vigour working at the root. What crops of wit and honesty appear, From spleen, from obstinacy, hate, or fear! See anger, zeal and fortitude supply; Ev'n av'rice, prudence; sloth, philosophy; Lust, thro' some certain strainers well refin'd Is gentle love, and charms all womankind: Envy, to which th'ignoble mind's a slave, Is emulation in the learn'd or brave: Nor virtue, male or female, can we name, But what will grow on Pride, or grow on Shame. Ver. 185, &amp;c.] Virtue and Vice join'd in our Mixt Nature; the Limits near, yet the things separate, and evident. The Office of Reason.Thus Nature gives us (let it check our pride) The virtue nearest to our vice ally'd; Reason the byass turns to good from ill, And Nero reigns a Titus if he will. The fiery soul abhor'd in Catiline, In Decius charms, in Curtius is divine. The same ambition can destroy or save, And makes a patriot, as it makes a knave. This light and darkness in our chaos join'd, What shall divide? The God within the Mind. Extremes in nature equal ends produce, In man, they join to some mysterious use: Tho' each by turns the other's bound invade, As in some well-wrought picture, light and shade, And oft so mix, the diff'rence is too nice Where ends the virtue, or begins the vice. Fools! who from hence into the notion fall, That vice or virtue there is none at all. If white and black, blend, soften, and unite A thousand ways, is there no black or white? Ask your own heart; and nothing is so plain; 'Tis to mistake them, costs the time and pain. Ver. 207.] Vice odious in itself, and how we deceive ourselves into it.Vice is a monster of so frightful mien, As, to be hated, needs but to be seen; Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face, We first endure, then pity, then embrace. But where th'Extreme of vice, was ne'er agreed: Ask, where's the North? at York 'tis on the Tweed, In Scotland at the Orcades, and there At Greenland, Zembla, or the lord knows where. No creature owns it in the first degree, But thinks his neighbour farther gone than he. Ev'n those who dwell beneath its very zone. Or never feel the rage, or never own; What happier natures shrink at with affright, The hard inhabitant contends is right Ver. 221, &amp;c.] The Ends of Providence and General Good answer'd in our Passions and Imperfections. How usefully these are distributed to all Orders of men.Virtuous and vicious ev'ry man must be, Few in th'extreme but all in the degree; The rogue and fool by fits is fair and wise, And ev'n the best by fits what they despise. 'Tis but by parts we follow good or ill. For, vice or virtue, Self directs it still; Each individual seeks a sev'ral goal: But Heav'n's great view is one, and that the Whole: That counter-works each folly and caprice; That disappoints th'effect of ev'ry vice: That, happy frailties to all ranks apply'd, Shame to the virgin, to the matron pride, Fear to the statesman, rashness to the chief, To Kings presumption, and to crowds belief. That, Virtue's ends from Vanity can raise, Which seeks no int'rest, no reward but praise; And build on wants, and on defects of mind, The joy, the peace, the glory of mankind. Ver. 239.] How useful these are to Society in general, and to Individuals in particular, in every State, 250. and ev'ry Age of Life, 260.Heav'n, forming each on other to depend, A master, or a servant, or a friend, Bids each on other for assistance call, Till one man's weakness grows the strength of all. Wants, frailties, passions, closer still ally The common int'rest, or endear the tye: To these we owe true friendship, love sincere, Each home-felt joy that life inherits here: Yet from the same we learn, in its decline, Those joys, those loves, those int'rests to resign; Taught half by reason, half by mere decay, To welcome death, and calmly pass away. Whate'er the Passion, knowledge, fame, or pelf, Not one will change his neighbour with himself: Thel earn'd is happy, nature to explore; The fool is happy, that he knows no more; The rich is happy in the plenty given; The poor contented with the care of heaven. See the blind beggar dance, the cripple sing, The sot a hero, lunatic a King, The starving Chymist in his golden views Supremely blest, the Poet in his muse. See! Some strange Comfort ev'ry state attend, And Pride bestow'd on all, a common friend; See! some fit Passion ev'ry age supply, Hope travels thro', nor quits us when we die. Till then, Opinion gilds with varying rays Those painted clouds that beautify our days; Each want of happiness by Hope supply'd, And each vacuity of sense by Pride. These build as fast as knowledge can destroy: In folly's cup still laughs the bubble, joy; One prospect lost, another still we gain; And not a Vanity is giv'n in vain; Ver. 273. See farther, of the Use of this Principle in Man. Epist. 3. ver. 121, 124, 135, 145, 200, &amp;c. 270, &amp;c. 316, &amp;c. And Epist. 4. ver. 348, and 358.Ev'n mean Self-Love becomes, by force divine, The scale to measure others wants by thine. See! and confess, one comfort still must rise, 'Tis this, tho' Man's a fool, yet God is wise. EPISTLE III. Of the Nature and State of Man with respect to Society. The whole Universe one System of Society. Here then we rest; “The Universal cause “Acts to one end, but acts by various laws.” In all the madness of superfluous health, The trim of pride, the impudence of wealth, Let this great truth be present night and day; But most be present, if we preach, or pray. Look round our world: behold the chain of love Combining all below, and all above. See, plastic Nature working to this end, The single atoms each to other tend, Attract, attracted to, the next in place, Form'd and impell'd, its neighbour to embrace. See matter next, with various life endu'd, Press to one centre still, the general good. See dying vegetables life sustain, See life dissolving vegetate again. All forms that perish other forms supply, By turns they catch the vital breath, and die; Like bubbles on the sea of matter born, They rise, they break, and to that sea return. Nothing is foreign: parts relate to whole: One all-extending, all-preserving soul Connects each being, greatest with the least; Made beast in aid of man, and man of beast: All serv'd, all serving! nothing stands alone; The chain holds on, and where it ends, unknown. V. 27. Nothing made wholly for Itself, nor yet wholly for another, but the happiness of all animals mutual.Has God, thou fool! work'd solely for thy good, Thy joy, thy pastime, thy attire, thy food? Who for thy table feeds the wanton fawn, For him as kindly spread the flow'ry lawn. Is it for thee the lark ascends and sings? Joy tunes his voice, joy elevates his wings. Is it for thee the linnet pours his throat? Loves of his own, and raptures swell the note. The bounding steed you pompously bestride, Shares with his lord the pleasure and the pride. Is thine alone the seed that strows the plain? The birds of heav'n shall vindicate their grain. Thine the full harvest of the golden year? Part pays, and justly, the deserving steer. The hog that plows not, nor obeys thy call, Lives on the labours of this lord of all. Know, Nature's children all divide her care; The fur that warms a Monarch, warm'd a bear. While man exclaims, “see all things for my use! “See man for mine,” replies a pamper'd goose; What care to tend, to lodge, to cram, to treat him? All this he knows, but not that 'tis to eat him: And just as short of reason, Man will fall, Who thinks all made for one, not one for all. Grant, that the pow'rful still the weak controul, Be man the wit, and tyrant of the whole: Nature that Tyrant checks; he only knows And helps, another creature's wants and woes. Say will the falcon, stooping from above, Smit with her varying plumage, spare the dove: Admires the jay the insect's gilded wings, Or hears the hawk, when Philomela sings? Man cares for all: to birds he gives his woods, To beasts his pastures, and to fish his floods; For some, his int'rest prompts him to provide, For more his pleasure, yet for more his pride: All feed on one vain patron, and enjoy Th'extensive blessing of his luxury. That very life his learned hunger craves, He saves from famine, from the savage saves; Nay feasts the animal he dooms his feast, And till he ends the being, makes it blest, Which sees no more the stroke, or feels the pain, Than favour'd man, by touch æthereal slain. The creature had his feast of life before; Ver. 72.] Several of the Ancients, and many of the Orientals since, esteem'd those who were struck by Lightning as sacred persons, and the particular favourites of Heaven.Thou two must perish, when thy feast is o'er. To each unthinking being Heav'n a friend, Gives not the useless knowledge of its End; To Man imparts it; but with such a view As, while he dreads it, makes him hope it too: The hour conceal'd, and so remote the fear, Death still draws nearer, never seeming near. Great standing Miracle! that heav'n assign'd Its only thinking thing, this turn of mind. Whether with Reason, or with Instinct blest, Know, all enjoy that pow'r which suits 'em best, Ver. 83.] Reason or Instinct alike operate to the good of each Individual, and they operate also to Society, in all Animals.To bliss, alike, by that direction tend, And find the means proportion'd to their end. Say, where full Instinct is the unerring guide, What Pope or Council can they need beside? Reason, however able, cool at best, Cares not for service, or but serves when prest, Stays still we call, and then not often near; But honest Instinct comes a Volunteer. This too serves always, reason never long; One must go right the other may go wrong. See then the acting and comparing pow'rs One in their nature, which are two in ours; And Reason raise o'er Instinct, as you can, In this 'tis God directs, in that 'tis Man. Who taught the nations of the field and wood To shun their poison, and to choose their food? Præscient, the tides or tempests to withstand, Build on the wave, or arch beneath the sand? Who made the spider parallels design, Sure as Demoivre, without rule or line? Who bid the stork, Columbus like, explore Heav'ns not his own, and worlds unknown before? Who calls the council, states the certain day, Who forms the phalanx, and who points the way? God, in the nature of each being, founds Its proper bliss, and sets its proper bounds: But as he fram'd a Whole, the whole to bless On mutual Wants built mutual Happiness: So from the first eternal Order ran, And Creature link'd to creature, Man to man. Whate'er of life all-quickening Æther keeps, Or breaths thro' air, or shoots beneath the deeps, Ver. 115.] How far Society carry'd by Instinct.Or pours profuse on earth; one nature feeds The vital flame, and swells the genial seeds. Not man alone, but all that roam the wood, Or wing the sky, or roll along the flood, Each loves itself, but not itself alone, Each Sex desires alike, till two are one: Nor ends the pleasure with the fierce embrace; They love themselves, a third time, in their race. Thus beast and bird their common charge attend, The mothers nurse it, and the sires defend; The young dismiss'd to wander earth or air, There stops the Instinct, and there ends the care; The link dissolves, each seeks a fresh embrace; Another love succeds, another race. A longer care Man's helpless kind demands; That longer care contracts more lasting bands: Reflection, Reason, still the ties improve, Ver. 132.] How much farther Society is carry'd by Reason.At once extend the int'rest, and the love: With Choice we fix, with Sympathy we burn; Each Virtue in each Passion takes it turn; And still new needs, new helps, new habits rise, That graft benevolence on charities. Still as one brood, and as another rose, These nat'ral love maintaind, habitual those; The last scarce ripen'd into perfect man, Saw helpless him from whom their life began: Mem'ry and forecast, just returns engage, That pointed back to youth, this on to age; While pleasure, gratitude, and hope combin'd Still spread the int'rest, and preserv'd the kind. Nor think, in Nature's State they blindly trod; The State of Nature was the Reign of God: Self Love, and Social, at her birth began, Ver. 148.] Of the State of Nature: That it was Social.Union the bond of all things, and of Man. Pride then was not; nor Arts, that pride to aid; Man walk'd with beast, joint tenant of the shade; The same his table, and the same his bed; No murder cloath'd him, and no murder fed. In the same Temple, the resounding wood, All vocal beings hymn'd their equal God: The shrine with gore unstain'd, with gold undrest, Unbrib'd, unbloody, stood the blameless Priest: Heav'ns Attribute was Universal care, And Man's Prerogative to rule, but spare. Ah how unlike the man of times to come! Of half that live, the Butcher, and the Tomb; Who, foe to nature, hears the gen'ral groan, Murders their species, and betrays his own. But just disease to luxury succeeds, And ev'ry death its own avenger breeds; The Fury-passions from that blood began, And turn'd on man a fiercer savage, Man. See him from Nature rising slow to Art! To copy instinct then was reason's part; Thus then to man the voice of Nature spake— Ver. 170.] Reason instructed by Instinct in the Invention of Arts, and in the Forms of Society.“Go! from the creatures thy instructions take; “Learn from the birds what food the thickets yield; “Learn from the beasts, the physick of the field: “Thy arts of building from the bee receive; “Learn of the mole to plow, the worm to weave; “Learn of the little Nautilus to sail, “Spread the thin oar, and catch the driving gale. “Here too all Forms of social union find, Ver. 178.] Oppian. Halieut. Lib. I. describes this Fish in the following manner. They swim on the surface of the Sea, on the back of their Shells, which exactly resemble the bulk of a Ship; they raise two feet like Masts, and extend a Membrane between, which serves as a Sail; the other two feet they employ as Oars at the side. They are usually seen in the Mediterranean“And hence let Reason, late, instruct mankind: “Here subterranean works and cities see, “Their Towns aerial on the waving tree. “Learn each small people's Genius, Policies; “The ants Republic, and the Realm of bees; “How those in common all their stores bestow, “And Anarchy without confusion know, “And these for ever, tho' a Monarch reign, “Their sep'rate cells and properties maintain. “Mark what unvary'd laws preserve their state, “Laws wise as nature, and as fix'd as fate. “In vain thy reason finer webs shall draw, “Entangle Justice in her net of law, “And right too rigid harden into wrong, “Still for the strong too weak, the weak too strong. “Yet go! and thus o'er all the creatures sway, “Thus let the wiser make the rest obey, “And for those arts meer Instinct could afford, “Be crown'd as Monarchs, or as Gods ador'd. Great Nature spoke; observant men obey'd; Cities were built, Societies were made: Here rose one little State; another near Ver. 200.] Origine of Political Societies.Grew by like means, and join'd thro' Love, or Fear. Did here the trees with ruddier burdens bend, And there the streams in purer rills descend? What War could ravish, Commerce could bestow, And he return'd a friend, who came a foe. Converse and Love mankind might strongly draw, When Love was Liberty, and Nature Law. Thus States were form'd; the name of King unknown, Till common int'rest plac'd the sway in one. 'Twas Virtue only (or in arts, or arms, Diffusing blessings, or averting harms) Ver. 211.] Origine of Monarchy.The same which in a Sire the sons obey'd, A Prince the father of a people made. Till then, by nature crown'd, each Patriarch sate, King, Priest, and Parent of his growing State: On him, their second Providence, they hung, Ver. 216.]? of Patriarchal Government.Their law his eye; their oracle, his tongue: He, from the wond'ring furrow call'd their food, Taught to command the Fire, controul the Flood, Draw forth the monsters of th'Abyss profound, Or fetch th'aerial Eagle to the ground. Till drooping, sickning, dying, they began Whom they rever'd as God, to mourn as Man: Then, looking up from sire to sire, explor'd One great, first father, and that first ador'd. Or plain Tradition that this All begun, Convey'd unbroken faith from sire to son, The Worker from the work distinct was known, And simple reason never sought but one: E're Wit oblique had broke that steady light, Man, like his Maker, saw, that all was right, To virtue in the paths of pleasure trod, And own'd a Father when he ownd a God. Love all the Faith, and all th'Allegiance then; For Nature knew no right divine in Men. No Ill could fear in God; and understood Ver. 236] Origine of True Religion and Government, from the Principle of Love; and of Superstition and Tyranny, from that of Fear.A sovereign Being but a sovereign Good. True Faith, true Policy, united ran, That was but Love of God, and this of Man. Who first taught souls enslav'd, and realms undone, Th'enormous faith of Many made for one? That proud exception to all nature's laws, T'invert the world, and counterwork its Cause? Force first made Conquest, and that conquest, Law; Till Superstition taught the tyrant awe, Then shar'd the tyranny, and lent it aid, And Gods of Conqu'rors, Slaves of subjects made: She, midst the lightning's blaze and thunder's sound, When rock'd the mountains and when groan'd the ground, She taught the weak to bend, the proud to pray To Pow'r unseen, and mightier far than they: She, from the rendring earth, and bursting skies, Saw Gods descend, and fiends infernal rise; Here fix'd the dreadful, there the blest abodes; Fear made her Devils, and weak Hope her Gods: Gods partial, changeful, passionate, unjust, Whose attributes were rage, revenge, or lust; Such as the souls of Cowards might conceive, And form'd like Tyrants, tyrants would believe. Zeal then, not Charity, became the guide, And Hell was built on spite, and Heav'n on pride. Then sacred seem'd th'æthereal vault no more; Alters grew marble then, and reek'd with gore: Then first the Flamen tasted living food, Next his grim idol smear'd with human blood; With heav'n's own thunders shook the world below, And play'd the God an engine on his foe. So drives Self-Love, thro' just and thro' unjust, To one man's pow'r, ambition, lucre, lust: The same Self-love, in all, becomes the cause Ver. 270.] The Influence of Self-Love operating to the Social and Public GoodOf what restrains him, Government and Laws. For what one likes, if others like as well, What serves one will, when many wills rebel? How shall he keep what sleeping or awake A weaker may surprize, a stronger take? His Safety must his Liberty restrain; All join to guard what each desires to gain. Forc'd into virtue thus by self-defence, Ev'n Kings learn'd justice and benevolence: Self-love forsook the path it first pursu'd, And found the private in the public good. 'Twas then, the studious head, or gen'rous mind, Foll'wer of God, of friend of human kind, Poet or Patriot, rose, but to restore Ver. 284.] Restoration of True Religion and Government on their first Principle. Mixt Governments; with the various Forms of each, and the True Use of All.The Faith and Moral Nature gave before; Re-lum'd her ancient light, not kindled new; If not God's image, yet his shadow drew: Taught pow'rs due use to People and to Kings, Taught, nor to slack nor strain its tender strings; The less and greater set so justly true, That touching one must strike the other too; Till jarring Int'rests of themselves create Th'according Music of a well-mix'd State. Such is the World's great harmony, that springs From Union, Order, full Consent of things; Where small and great, where weak and mighty, made To serve, not suffer, strengthen, not invade, More pow'rful each, as needful to the rest, And in proportion as it blesses, blest, Draw to one point, and to one centre bring Beast, Man, or Angel, Servant, Lord, or King. For Forms of Goverment let fools contest, Whate'er is best administred, is best: For Modes of Faith let graceless zealots fight, His can't be wrong, whose life is in the right: All must be false, that thwart this one, great End, And all of God, that bless mankind, or mend. Man, like the gen'rous vine supported lives, The strength he gains is from the embrace he gives. On their own Axis, as the Plannets run, Yet make at once their circle round the Sun; So two consistent motions act the soul, And one regards Itself, and one the Whole. Thus God and Nature link'd the gen'ral frame, And bade Self-love and Social be the same. EPISTLE IV. Of the Nature and State of Man, with respect to Happiness. O Happiness! our being's end and aim! Good, pleasure, ease, content! whate'er thy name: That something still which prompts th'eternal sigh, For which we bear to live, and dare to die; Which still so near us, yet beyond us lies, O'erlook'd, seen double, by the fool, and wise. Plant of Cælestial seed! if dropt below, Say, in what mortal soil thou deign'st to grow? Fair-opening to some Court's propitious shine, Or deep with diamonds in the flaming mine, Twin'd with the wreaths Parnassion laurels yield, Or reap'd in Iron harvests of the Field? Where grows—where grows it not? if vain our toil, We ought to blame the Culture, not the Soil: Fix'd to no spot is Happiness sincere, 'Tis no where to be found, or ev'ry where, 'Tis never to be bought, but always free, And fled from Monarchs, St. John! dwells with thee. Ask of the Learn'd the way, the Learn'd are blind, This bids to serve, and that to shun mankind; Some place the bliss in action, some in ease; Those call it pleasure, and contentment these: Who thus define it, say they more or less Than this, that Happiness is Happiness? One grants his pleasure is but rest from pain; One doubts of all; one owns ev'n Virtue vain. Ver. 27.] Happiness the End of all Men, and attainable by all.Take Nature's path, and mad Opinion's leave, All states can reach it, and all heads conceive; Obvious her goods, in no extreme they dwell, There needs but thinking right and meaning well; And mourn our various portions as we please, Ver. 32.] God governs by general not particular Laws; intends Happiness to be equal, and to be so, it must be social, since all particular Happiness depends on general.Equal is common Sense, and common Ease. Remember, Man, “the Universal Cause “Acts not by partial but by gen'ral laws; And makes what Happiness we justly call, Subsist not in the good of one, but all. There's not a blessing Individuals find, But some way leans and hearkens to the Kind. No Bandit fierce, no Tyrant mad with pride, No cavern'd Hermit, rest self-satisfy'd; Who most to shun or hate mankind pretend, Seek and admirer, or wou'd fix a friend. Abstract what others feel, what others think, All pleasures sicken, and all Glories sink. Each has his share; and who wou'd more obtain, Shall find, the pleasure pays not half the pain. Ver. 47.] It is necessary for Order and the common Peace, that External Goods be unequal, therefore Happiness is not constituted in these. Order is Heav'n's great Law; and this confest, Some are and must be, mightier than the rest, More rich, more wise: but who infers from hence That such are happier, shocks all common sense. Heav'n to mankind impartial we confess, If all are equal in their Happiness: But mutual wants this happiness increase, All Nature's diff'rence keeps all nature's peace. Condition, Circumstance is not the thing: Bliss is the same, in Subject, or in King, In who obtain defence, or who defend, In him who is, or him who finds, a friend. Heav'n breathes thro' ev'ry member of the whole One common blessing, as one common soul. But Fortune's gifts if each alike possest, And each were equal, must not all contest? If then to all men happiness was meant, God in Externals could not place content. Ver. 65.] The balance of human happiness kept equal (notwithstanding Externals) by Hope and Fear.Fortune her gifts may variously dispose, And these be happy call'd, unhappy those: But Heav'n's just balance equal will appear, While those are plac'd in Hope, and these in Fear: Not present Good or Ill, the joy or curse, But future views, of better, or of worse. Oh Sons of earth! attempt ye still to rise By mountains pil'd on mountains to the Skies? Heav'n still with laughter the vain toil surveys, And buries madmen in the heaps they raise. Ver. 75.] In what the Happiness of Individuals consists, and that the Good Man has the Advantage, even in this world.Know all the good that individuals find, Or God and nature meant to meer mankind, Reason's whole pleasures, all the joys of sense, Lie in three words, Health, Peace, and Competence. But Health consists with temperance alone, And Peace, O Virtue! Peace is all thy own; The good or bad the gifts of Fortune gain; But these less taste them, as they worse obtain. Say, in pursuit of profit or delight, Who risque the most, that take wrong means or right? Of vice or virtue, whether blest or curst, Which meets contempt, or which compassion first? Count all th'advantage prosp'rous vice attains, 'Tis but what virtue flies from, and disdains; And grant the bad what happiness they wou'd, One they must want, which is, to pass for good. Ver. 91.] That no man is unhappy thro' Virtue.Oh blind to truth, and God's whole scheme below! Who fancy bliss to vice, to virtue woe: Who sees, and follows, that great scheme the best, Best knows the blessing, and will most be blest. But fools the Good alone unhappy call, For ills or accidents that chance to All. See Falkland dies, the virtuous and the just! See godlike Turenne prostrate on the dust! See Sidney bleeds amid the martial strife! Was this their Virtue, or Contempt of life? Say was it Virtue, more tho' heav'n ne'er gave, Lamented Digby! sunk thee to the grave? Tell me, if Virtue made the Son expire, Why, full of days and honour, lives the Sire? Why drew Marseille's good bishop purer breath, When nature sicken'd and each gale was death? Or why so long (in life if long can be) Lent heav'n a Parent to the Poor, and me? What makes all Physical or Moral ill? There deviates Nature, and here wanders Will. God sends not Ill; if rightly understood, Or partial ill is universal good, Or Change admits, or Nature lets it fall, Short and but rare, till Man improv'd it all. We just as wisely might of heav'n complain, That righteous Abel was destroy'd by Cain, As that the virtuous son is ill at ease, When his lewd father gave the dire disease. Think we like some weak Prince th'Eternal Cause, Prone for his Fav'rites to reverse his laws? Shall burning Ætna, if a sage requires, Forget to thunder, and recall her fires? On Air or Sea new motions be imprest, O blameless Bethel! to relieve thy breast? When the loose mountain trembles from on high, Shall gravitation cease if you go by? Or some old temple nodding to its fall, For Chartres' head reserve the hanging wall? But still this world (so fitted for the knave) Contents us not. A better shall we have? A kingdom of the just then let it be: But first consider how those just agree? The good must merit God's peculiar care; But who but God can tell us which they are? One thinks on Calvin heav'n's own spirit fell, Another deems him Instrument of hell? If Calvin feel heav'n's blessing, or its rod, This cries there is, and that, “there is no God.” What shocks one part will edify the rest, Nor with one system can they all be blest. The very best will variously incline, And what rewards your Virtue, punish mine. “Whatever is, is right.” This world, 'tis true, Was made for Cæsar—but for Titus too: And which more blest? who chain'd his Country, say, Or he, whose virtue sigh'd to lose a day? “But sometimes Virtue starves while Vice is fed.” What then? is the reward of virtue, bread? That, Vice may merit; 'tis the price of Toil: The knave deserves it when he tills the soil; The knave deserves it when he tempts the main, Where Folly fights, for Tyrants, or for Gain. The good man may be weak, be indolent, Nor is his claim to Plenty, but Content. But grant him Riches, your demand is o'er? “No—shall the good want Health, the good want Pow'r? Add health, and pow'r, and ev'ry earthly thing: “Why bounded pow'r? why private? why no King? Nay, why external for internal giv'n, Why is not Man a God, and Earth a Heav'n? Who ask and reason thus, will scarce conceive God gives enough while he has more to give: Immense the pow'r, immense were the demand; Say, at what part of nature will they stand? What nothing earthly gives, or can destroy, The soul's calm sun-shine, and the heart-felt joy, Ver. 167.] That External Goods are not the proper Rewards of Virtue, often inconsistent with, or destructive of it; but that all these can make no man happy without Virtue. Instanced in each of them.Is Virtue's prize: a better would you fix? Then give Humility a Coach and six, Justice a Conqu'ror's sword, or Truth a Gown, Or publick Spirit its great cure, a Crown: Rewards, that either would to virtue bring No joy, or be destructive of the thing. How oft by these at sixty are undone The virtues of a Saint at twenty one! Ver. 175.] Riches.For Riches, can they give, but to the Just, His own contentment, or another's trust? Judges and Senates have been bought for gold, Esteem and love were never to be sold. O fool! to think, God hates the worthy mind, The Lover, and the Love, of Human kind, Whose life is healthful, and whose conscience clear; Because he wants a thousand pounds a year! Ver. 183. Honours,Honour and shame from no Condition rise; Act well your part, there all the Honour lies. Fortune in men has some small diff'rence made, One flaunts in rags, one flutters in brocade. The Cobler apron'd, and the Parson gown'd, The Fryar hooded, and the Monarch crown'd. “What differ more (you cry) than crown and cowl?” I'll tell you, friend: a Wise man and a fool. You'll find, if once the monarch acts the monk, Or cobler-like, the parson will be drunk, Worth makes the Man, and want of it the Fellow; The rest, is all but Leather or Prunella. 195. Titles,Stuck o'er with Titles, and hung round with strings, That thou may'st be, by Kings, or Whores of kings. 197. Birth,Thy boasted blood, a thousand years or so, May from Lucretia to Lucretia flow; But by your Father's worth if yours you rate, Count me those only who were good and great. Go! if your antient but ignoble blood Has crept thro' scoundrels ever since the Flood, Go! and pretend your family is young; Not own your fathers have been fools so long. What can ennoble sots, or slaves, or cowards? Alas! not all the blood of all the Howards. 207. Greatness.Look next on Greatness, say where Greatness lies? “Where, but among the Heroes, and the Wise? Heroes are much the same, the point's agreed, From Macedonia's Madman to the Swede; The whole strange purpose of their lives, to find Or make, an enemy of all mankind; Not one looks backward, onward still he goes, Yet ne'er looks forward farther than his nose. No less alike the Politick and wise, All sly, slow things, with circumspective eyes; Men in their loose, unguarded hours they take, Nor that themselves are wife, but others weak. But grant that those can conquer, these can cheat, 'Tis phrase absurd to call a Villain Great: Who wickedly is wise, or madly brave, Is but the more a fool, the more a knave. Who noble ends by noble means obtains, Or failing, smiles in Exile or in chains, Like good Aurelius let him reign, or bleed Like Socrates, that man is great indeed, Ver. 227. Fame.What's Fame? that fancy'd life in others breath, A thing beyond us, ev'n before our death. Just what you hear, you have, and what's unknown The same (my Lord) if Tully's, or your own. All that we feel of it begins and ends In the small circle of our foes or friends; To all beside, as much an empty shade An Eugene living, as a Cæsar dead, Alike, or when or where, they shone or shine, Or on the Rubicon, or on the Rhine. A Wit's a feather, and a Chief a rod; An honest man's the noblest work of God: Fame but from death a villain's name can save, As Justice tears his body from the grave; When what t'oblivion better were resign'd Is hung on high, to poison half mankind. All fame is foreign, but of true Desert, Plays round the head, but comes not to the heart. One self-approving hour whole years out-weighs Of stupid starers, and of loud huzza's; And more true joy Marcellus exil'd feels, Than Cæsar with a Senate at his heels. Ver. 249. Superior Parts.In Parts superior what advantage lies! Tell (for You can) what is it to be wise? 'Tis but to know, how little can be known; To see all others faults, and feel our own; Condemn'd, in business or in arts, to drudge Without a Second, or without a Judge: Truths would you teach, or save a sinking land? All fear, none aid you, and few understand. Painful Preheminence! your self to view Above Life's weakness, and its Comforts too. Bring then these blessings to a strict account, Make fair deductions, see to what they mount? How much of other each is sure to cost? How each for other oft is wholly lost? How inconsistent greater goods with these? How sometimes Life is risqu'd, and always Ease? Think, and if still the things thy envy call, Say, wouldst thou be the Man to whom they fall? To sigh for ribbands if thou art so silly, Mark how they grace Lord Umbra, or Sir Billy: Is yellow dirt the passion of thy life? Look but on Gripus, or on Gripus' wife: If parts allure thee, think how Bacon shin'd, The wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind, Or ravish'd with the whistling of a name, See Cromwell, damn'd to everlasting fame! If all, united, thy ambition call, From ancient Story learn to scorn them all. There, in the rich, the honour'd, fam'd, and great, See the false scale of Happiness compleat! In hearts of Kings or arms of Queens who lay, (How happy!) those to ruin, these betray: Mark by what wretched steps their glory grows, From dirt and sea-weed as proud Venice rose; In each, how guilt and greatness equal ran, And all that rais'd the Hero, sunk the Man. Now Europe's laurels on their brows behold, But stain'd with blood, or ill exchang'd for gold: Then see them broke with Toils, or sunk in Ease, Or infamous for plunder'd Provinces. Oh wealth ill-fated! which no act of fame E'er taught to shine, or sanctify'd from shame! What greater bliss attends their close of life? Some greedy Minion, or imperious Wife, The trophy'd Arches, story'd Halls invade, And haunt their slumbers in the pompous shade. Alas! not dazled with their noontide ray, Compute the morn and evening to the day: The whole amount of that enormous fame, A Tale! that blends their Glory with their Shame. Know then this truth (enough for man to know) Ver. 300.] That Virtue only constitutes a Happiness, whose Object is Universal, and whose Prospect Eternal.“Virtue alone is Happiness below: The only point where human bliss stands still, And tastes the good without the fall to ill; Where only, merit constant pay receives, Is bless'd in what it takes, and what it gives; The joy unequal'd, if its end it gain, And if it lose, attended with no pain; Without satiety, tho' e'er so bless'd, And but more relish'd as the more distress'd; The broadest mirth unfeeling Folly wears, Less pleasing far than Virtue's very tears: Good, from each object, from each place acquir'd; For ever exercis'd, yet never tir'd; Never elated, while one man's oppress'd, Never dejected, while another's bless'd; And where no wants, no wishes can remain, Since but to wish more virtue, is to gain. See! the sole bliss Heav'n could on All bestow, Ver. 318, &amp;c.] That the Perfection of Happiness consists in a Conformity to the Order of Providence here, and a Resignation to it, here and hereafter.Which who but feels, can taste, but thinks, can know: Yet poor with Fortune, and with Learning blind, The bad must miss, the good untaught will find; Slave to no sect, who takes no private road, But looks thro' Nature up to Nature's God; Pursues that chain which links th'immense design, Joins Heav'n and Earth, and mortal, and divine; Sees, that no being any bliss can know; But touches some above, and some below; Learns, from this Union of the rising Whole, The first, last purpose of the human soul; And knows, where Faith, Law, Morals all began, All end, in Love of God, and Love of Man. For him alone, Hope leads from gole to gole, And opens still, and opens on his soul; Till lengthen'd on to Faith, and unconfin'd, It pours the bliss that fills up all the mind. He sees, why Nature plants in Man alone Hope of known bliss, and Faith in bliss unknown: (Nature, whose dictates to no other kind Are giv'n in vain, but what they seek, they find) Wise in the Present: she connects in this His greatest Virtue with his greatest Bliss, At once his own bright prospect to be blest, And strongest motive to assist the rest. Self-love thus push'd to social, to divine, Gives thee to make thy neighbour's blessing thine: Is this too little for the boundless heart? Extend it, let thy Enemies have part: Grasp the whole worlds, of reason, life, and sense, In one close system of Benevolence. Happier, as kinder! in whate'er degree, And height of Bliss but height of Charity. God loves from whole to parts: but human soul Must rise from individual to the whole. Self-love but serves the virtuous mind to wake, As the small pebble stirs the peaceful lake; The centre mov'd, a circle strait succeeds; Another still, and still another spreads; Friend, parent, neighbour, first it will embrace, His country next, and next all human-race; Wide, and more wide, th'o'erflowings of the mind Take ev'ry creature in, of ev'ry kind; Earth smiles around, with boundless bounty blest, And Heav'n beholds its image in his breast. Come then, my Friend! my Genius come along, Oh master of the Poet, and the Song! And while the Muse now stoops, or now ascends, To Man's low passions, or their glorious Ends, Teach me like thee, in various nature wise, To fall with dignity, with temper rise; Form'd by thy converse, happily to steer From grave to gay, from lively to severe; Correct with spirit, eloquent with ease, Intent to reason, or polite to please. O! while along the stream of Time, thy name Expanded flies, and gathers all its fame, Say, shall my little bark attendant sail, Pursue the triumph, and partake the gale? When Statesmen, Heroes, Kings, in dust repose, Whose sons shall blush their fathers were thy foes. Shall then this verse to future age pretend Thou wert my Guide, Philosopher, and Friend? That urg'd by thee, I turn'd the tuneful art From sounds to things, from Fancy to the Heart; For Wit's false mirror held up Nature's light; Shew'd erring Pride, whatever Is, is Right; That Reason, Passion, answer one great Aim; That true Self-love and Social are the same; That Virtue only makes our Bliss below; And all our Knowledge is, Ourselves to know. End of the First Book. ETHIC EPISTLES, THE SECOND BOOK. THE CONTENTS. EPISTLE I. Of the Knowledge and Characters of Men, To Sir Richard Temple, Lord Viscount Cobham. That for this Knowledge it is not sufficient to consider Man in the Abstract: Books will not serve the purpose, nor yet our own Observation, singly, Ver. 1. General Maxims, unless they be form'd upon both, will be but notional, 10. Some Peculiarity in every Man, characteristic to himself, yet varying from himself, 15; the further difficulty of separating and fixing this, arising from our own Passions, Fancies, Faculties, &amp;c. 23. The shortness of life, to observe in, and the uncertainty of the Principles of Action in Men, to observe by, 29. Our own Principle of Action often hid from ourselves, 41. No judging of the Motives from the Actions: the same Actions proceeding from contrary Motives, and the same Motives influencing contrary Actions, 51 to 70. Yet to form Characters, we can only take the strongest Actions of a man's life, and try to make them agree: The utter Uncertainty of this, from Nature itself, and from Policy, 71. Characters given according to the Rank of Men in the World, and some Reason for it, 87. Education alters the Nature, or at least Character of many, 101. Some few Characters plain, but in general confounded, dissembled, or inconsistent, 122. The same Man utterly different in different places and seasons, 130. Unimaginable Weakness in the Greatest, 140. Nothing constant and certain but God and Nature. Of Man we cannot judge, by his Nature, his Actions, his Passions, his Opinions, his Manners, Humours, or Principles, all subject to change, 160, &amp;c. It only remains to find (if we can) his Ruling Passion. That will certainly influence all the rest, and only can reconcile the seeming or real Inconsistency of his Actions, 176. Instanced in the extraordinary Character of Clodio, 181. A Caution against mistaking second Qualities for first, which will destroy all possibility of the Knowledge of Mankind, 212. Examples of the Strength of the Ruling Passion, and its Continuation to the last breath, 224, &amp;c. EPISTLE II. Of the Characters of Women. To a Lday. Of the Characters of Women (consider'd only as contradistinguished from the other Sex.) That these are yet more incosistent and incomprehensible than those of Men, of which Instances are given even from such Characters as are plainest, and most strongly mark'd; as in the Affected, Ver. 7, &amp;c. The Soft-natur'd. 29. the Cunning, 45. the Whimsical, 50. the Wits and Refiners, 69. the Stupid and Silly. 80. How Contrarieties run thro' them all. But tho' the Particular Characters of this Sex are more various than those of Men, the General Characteristick, as to the Ruling Passion, is more uniform and confin'd. In what That lies, and whence it proceeds, 109, &amp;c. Men are best known in public Life, Women in private, 110. What are the Aims, and the Fate of the Sex, both as to Power and Pleasure? 121, 133, &amp;c. Advice for their true Interest, 151. The Picture of an esteemable Woman, made up of the best Kind of Contrarieties. 171, &amp;c. EPISTLE III. Of the Use of Riches, To Allen Lord Bathurst. The true Use of Riches known to few, most falling into one of the Extremes, Avarice or Profusion, Ver. 1, &amp;c. The Point discuss'd whether the Invention of Money was more commodious or pernicious to Mankind, 21 to 28. Riches can scarce afford Necessaries either to the Avaritious or Prodigal, much less any happiness, 81, &amp;c. It is never for their own Families, or for the Poor, that Misers covet Wealth, but a direct Phrensy without an end or purpose, 100. Conjectures about the Motives of avaricious men, to 152. That it can only be accounted for by the Order of Providence, which works General Good out of Extremes, and brings all to its Great End by perpetual Revolutions, 153 to 178. A Picture of a Miser acting upon Principles which appear to him reasonable, 179. Another of a Prodigal acting on the contrary Principles, which seem to him equally right, 199. The due Medium and true Use of Riches, 219 to 248. The Character and Praises of the Man of Ross, 250. The Fate of the Covetous, and of the Profuse, in Two Examples, 298, and 315. That both are miserable, in Life and in Death. The Tale of Sir Balaam, the Degrees of Corruption by Riches, and the Consequences, 339, &amp;c. EPISTLE IV. Of the same, To Richard E. of Burlington. The Extremes of Avarice and Profusion being treated of in the foregoing Epistle, this takes up one particular Branch of the latter; the Vanity of Expence in People of Wealth and Quality. The abuse of the word Taste, Ver. 13. that the First Principle and Foundation, in this as in every thing else, is Good Sense, 40. The chief proof of it is to follow Nature, even in works of mere Luxury and Elegance. Instanced in Architecture and Gardening, where all must be adapted to the Genius and Use of the Place, and the Beauties not forced into it, but resulting from it, 50. How men are disappointed in their most expensive Undertakings for want of this true Foundation, without which nothing can please long, if at all; and the best Examples and Rules will but be perverted into something burdensome or ridiculous, 65, &amp;c. to 90. A Description of the False Taste of Magnificence; the first grand Error of which is to imagine that Greatness consists in the Size and Dimension, instead of the Proportion and Harmony, of the Whole, 93. and the second, either in joining together Parts incoherent, or too minutely resembling, or in the Repetition of the same too frequently, 103, &amp;c. A word or two of False Taste in Books, in Musick, in Painting, even in Preaching and Prayer, and lastly in Entertainments, 125, &amp;c. Yet Providence is justified in giving Wealth to be squandered in this manner, since it is dispersed to the Poor and Laborious part of mankind, 161. (recurring to what is laid down in the first book, Epist. 2. and in the Epistle preceding this, V. 165) What are the proper Objects of Magnificence, and a proper Field for the Expence of Great Men, 169, &amp;c. and finally the Great and Publick Works which become a Prince, 187 to the End. EPISTLE I. TO Sir Richard Temple, Lord Viscount Cobham. Ver. 1. &amp;c. Of the Knowledge and Characters of Men. That it is not sufficient for this Knowledge to consider Man in the Abstract. Yes, you despise the Man to books confin'd, Who from his Study rails at human kind; Tho' what he learns he speaks, and may advance Some gen'ral maxims, or be right by chance. The coxcomb bird, so talkative and grave, That from his cage cries cuckold, whore, and knave, Tho' many a passenger he rightly call, You hold him no Philosopher at all. And yet the fate of all Extremes is such, V. 10. Not to be learn'd either by Books or our own Observation singly, but by both.Men may be read, as well as books, too much, To observations which ourselves we make, We grow more partial for th'Observer's sake; To written wisdom, as another's, less: Maxims are drawn from Notions, these from Guess. V. 15. General Maxims notional, a Peculiarity in ev'ry Man.There's some Peculiar in each Leaf and Grain; Some unmark'd fibre, or some varying vein: Shall only Man be taken in the gross? V. 18. There are above 300 Sorts of Moss observed by Naturalists.Grant but as many sorts of mind, as Moss. V. 19. The difficulties of discovering and fixing this Peculiarity.That each from other differs, first confess; Next, that he varies from himself no less: Add Nature's, Custom's, Reason's, Passion's strife, And all Opinion's colours cast on Life. Yet more; the diff'rence is as great between The Optics seeing, as the objects seen. All Manners take a tincture from our own, Or come discolour'd thro' our Passions shown, Or Fancy's beam inlarges, multiplies, Contracts, inverts, and gives ten thousand dyes. V. 29. The Uncertainty of the Principles of Action in Men.Our Depths who fathoms, or our Shallows finds? Quick Whirls, and shifting Eddies, of our minds? Life's stream for observation will not stay, It hurries all too fast to mark their way: In vain sedate reflections we would make, When half our knowledge we must snatch, not take. On human actions reason tho' you can, It may be Reason, but it is not Man; His Principle of action once explore, That instant, 'tis his principle no more; Like following life thro' Creatures you dissect, You lose it, in the moment you detect. V. 41. Our own Principle of Action, often unknown to ourselves.Oft, in the Passions wild rotation tost, Our Spring of action to ourselves is lost: Tir'd, not determin'd, to the last we yield, And what comes then is master of the field. As the last Image of that troubled heap When sense subsides, and Fancy sports in sleep, (Tho' past the recollection of the thought) Becomes the stuff of which our Dream is wrought; Something, as dim to our internal view, Is thus perhaps the cause of all we do. V. 51, &amp;c. to 70. No judging of the Motives from the Actions, the same Actions proceeding from contrary Motives, and contrary Actions from the same Motives.In vain the grave, with retrospective eye, Would from th'apparent what conclude the why, Infer the Motive from the Deed, and show That what we chanc'd, was what we meant to do. Behold! if Fortune, or a Mistress frowns, Some plunge in bus'ness, others shave their crowns: To ease the soul of one oppressive weight, This quits an Empire, that embroils a State: The same adust complexion has impell'd V. 60. Charles V. Philip. II. Charles to the Convent, Philip to the Field. Not always Actions shew the Man: we find, Who does a kindness is not therefore kind; Perhaps Prospertity becalm'd his breast; Perhaps the Wind just shifted from the east. Not therefore humble he who seeks retreat, Pride guides his steps, and bids him shun the Great. Who combats bravely, is not therefore brave; He dreads a death-bed like the meanest slave. Who reasons wisely, is not therefore wise; His pride in reas'ning, not in acting lies. V. 71. To form Characters, we can only take the strongest and most shining Actions of a man's Life, and try to make them consistent. The Uncertainty of this!But grant that Actions best discover man; Take the most strong, and sort them as you can: The few that glare, each Character must mark, You balance not the many in the dark. What will you do with such as disagree? Suppress them, or miscall them Policy? Must then at once (the character to save) A plain, rough Hero turn a crafty knave? Alas! in truth the man but chang'd his mind, Perhaps was sick, in love, or had not din'd. Ask why from Britain, Cæsar made retreat? Cæsar perhaps had told you, he was beat. The mighty Czar what mov'd to wed a punk? The mighty Czar might answer, he was drunk. But sage Historians! 'tis your task to prove One action Conduct, one Heroic love. V. 87. Characters given meerly according to the Rank of men in the world.'Tis from high Life high Characters are drawn; A Saint in crape, is twice a Saint in lawn; A Judge is just, a Chanc'lor juster still; A Gownman learn'd; a Bishop, what you will; Wise, if a Minister; but if a King, More wise, more learn'd, more just, more ev'ry thing. Court-virtues bear, like gems, the highest rate, Born where heav'n's influence scarce can penetrate. In life's low vale, (the soil the Virtues like) They please as beauties, here as wonders strike. Tho' the same Sun with all diffusive rays Blush in the rose, and in the diamond blaze, We prize the stronger effort of his pow'r, And always set the gem above the flow'r. V. 101. Education alters the Character of most men.'Tis Education forms the vulgar mind: Just as the Twig is bent, the Tree's inclin'd. Boastful and rough, your first son is a Squire; The next a Tradesman, meek, and much a liar: Tom struts a Soldier, open, bold, and brave; Will sneaks a Scriv'ner, an exceeding knave: Is he a Churchman? then he's fond of pow'r; A Quaker? sly; a Presbyterian? sour; A smart Free thinker? all things in an hour. V. 110. Of plain Characters.True, some are open and to all Men known; Others so very close, they're hid from none; (So darkness fills the Eye no less than Light) Thus gracious Chandos is belov'd at sight: And ev'ry child hates Shylock, tho' his Soul Still sits at squat, and peeps not from its hole. At half mankind when gen'rous Manly raves, All know 'tis Virtue, for he thinks them knaves. When universal homage Umbra pays, All see 'tis Vice, and itch of vulgar praise. Who but detests th'Endearments of Courtine? While One there is, who charms us with his Spleen. V. 122. Of the Causes confounding Characters.But these plain Characters we rarely find, Tho' strong the bent, yet quick the turns of mind: Or puzzling Contraries confound the whole, Or Affectations quite reverse the Soul: The dull, flat Falsehood serves for policy, And in the cunning, Truth itself's a lye: Unthought of Frailties cheat us in the Wise; The Fool lies hid in Inconsistencies. V. 130. Of the Inconsistency of a Man with himself.See the same man, in vigour, in the gout; Alone, in company; in place, or out; Early at bus'ness, and at Hazard late; Mad at a fox-chase, wise at a debate; Drunk at a borough, civil at a ball; Friendly at Hackney, faithless at Whitehall. V. 136. Unimaginable Weaknesses in the best or greatest Men. Catius is ever moral, ever grave, Thinks who endures a knave, is next a knave; Save just at Dinner—then prefers no doubt, A rogue with Ven'son to a saint without. Who would not praise Patritio's high desert? His hand unstain'd, his uncorrupted heart, His comprehensive head; all Int'rests weigh'd, All Europe sav'd, yet Britain not betray'd. He thanks you not; his pride was in Piquette, Newmarket-fame, and judgment at a bett. Triumphant Leaders, at an Army's head, Hemm'd round with glories, pilfer cloth or bread, As meanly plunder, as they bravely fought, Now save a People, and now save a groat. What made (say Montagne, or more sage Charron!) Otho a Warrior, Cromwell a Buffoon? V. 152. A perjur'd Prince, &amp;c. Lewis XI. of France.A perjur'd Prince a leaden Saint revere? A god-less Regent tremble at a Star? The throne a Bigot keep, a Genius quit, V. 155. &amp;c. Victor Amadeo II. King of Sardinia, who resign'd his Crown to his Son, and afterwards being inclin'd to resume it, was Imprisoned till he died.Faithless thro' Piety, and dup'd thro' Wit? Europe, a Woman, child, or dotard rule; And just her ablest Monarch made a fool? V. 158. Nothing constant and certain, but God and Nature.Know, God and Nature only are the same: In Man, the judgment shoots at flying game; A bird of passage! lost, as soon as found; Now in the Moon perhaps, now under ground! V. 162, &amp;c. No judgement to be made of Men by their Opinions, Manners, Humours, Principles, Constitution, Actions, Affections, Passions—only by the Ruling Passion.Ask mens Opinions: Scoto now shall tell How trade increases, and the world goes well; Strike off his pension by the setting sun, And Britain, if not Europe, is undone. Manners with Fortunes, Humours change with Climes, Tenets with Books, and Principles with Times. Judge we by Nature? Habit can efface, Int'rest o'ercome, or Policy take place: By Actions? those Uncertainty divides: By Passions? these Dissimulation hides: Affections? they still take a wider range: Find, if you can, in what you cannot change? 'Tis in the ruling Passion: there alone, V. 175. This, if to be found, reconciles the seeming, or real Inconsistencies of Men's Actions. An Example, in a Character of the strongest Contradictions.The wild are constant, and the cunning known, The fool consistent, and the false sincere; Priests, Princes, Women, no dissemblers here. This clue once found, unravels all the rest; The prospect clears, and Clodio stands confest. Clodio, the Scorn and Wonder of our days, Whose ruling passion was the Lust of Praise; Born with whate'er could win it from the wise, Women and fools must like him, or he dies. Tho' wond'ring Senates hung on all he spoke, The Club must hail him Master of the Joke. Shall parts so various aim at nothing new? He'll shine a Tully, and a Wilmot too: Then turns repentant, and his God adores With the same spirit that he drinks and whores: Enough, if all around him but admire, And now the Punk applaud, and now the Fry'r. Thus, with each gift of Nature and of Art, And wanting nothing but an honest heart; Grown all to all, from no one vice exempt, And most contemptible to shun contempt; His Passion still to covet gen'ral praise; His Life, to forfeit it a thousand ways; A constant Bounty, which no friend has made; An Angel Tongue which no man can persuade; A Fool, with more of Wit than half mankind; Too rash for Thought, for Action too refin'd; A Tyrant to the Wife his heart approves; A Rebel to the very King he loves; He dies, sad out-cast of each Church and State! And (harder still) flagitious, yet not great. Ask you why Clodio broke thro' every rule? 'Twas all for fear, the Knaves should call him fool. Nature well known, no Miracles remain, Comets are regular, and Clodio plain. V. 210. A caution against the mistake of second Qualities for first, which will destroy all possibility of the Knowledge of Mankind.Yet in the search, the wisest may mistake, If second Qualities for first they take. When Catiline by rapine swell'd his store, When Cæsar made a noble dame a whore, In this the Lust, in that the Avarice Were means, not ends; Ambition was the vice. That very Cæsar, born in Scipio's days, Had aim'd, like him, by Chastity at praise: Lucullus, when Frugality could charm, Had roasted turnips in the Sabin farm. In vain th'Observer eyes the builder's toil, But quite mistakes the Scaffold for the Pile. V. 222, &amp;c. Examples of the strength, and certain continuance of the Ruling Passion till Death.In this one Passion man can strength enjoy, As Fits give vigour, just when they destroy. Time, that on all things lays his lenient hand, Yet tames not this: it sticks to our last sand. Consistent in our follies, and our sins, Here honest Nature ends as she begins. Behold a rev'rend Sire, whom want of grace Has made the father of a nameless race, Crawl thro' the street, shov'd on, or rudely press'd By his own sons that pass him by unbless'd! Still to his Wench he creeps on knocking knees, And envies ev'ry Sparrow that he sees. A Salmon's belly, Helluo, was thy fate: The Doctor call'd declares all help too late. Mercy! cries Helluo, mercy on my soul! Is there no hope? alas?—then bring the Jowl. “Odious! in Woollen! 'twou'd a Saint provoke, (Were the last words that poor Narcissa spoke) “No, let a charming Chintz, and Brussels lace “Wrap my cold limbs, and shade my lifeless face: “One would not, sure, be frightful when one's dead— “And, Betty! gives this cheek a little red. Old Politicians chew on Wisdom past, And blunder on in bus'ness to the last; As weak as earnest; and as gravely out, V. 247. An ancient Nobleman who continued this practise long after his legs were disabled by the Gout. Upon the death of Prince George of Denmark, he demanded an Audience of the Queen, to advise her to preserve her health, and dispell her grief by Dancing. The rest of these Instances are strictly true, tho' the Persons are not named.As sober Lanesb'row, dancing in the Gout. The Courtier smooth, who forty years had shin'd An humble servant to all human kind, Just brought out this, when scarce his tongue could stir, “If—where I'm going—I could serve you, Sir.” “I give and I devise (old Euclio said, And sigh'd) “my Lands and Tenements to Ned.” Your Money, sir? “My Money, sir! what all? “Why—if I must—(then wept) I give it Paul.” The Mannor, Sir? “The Mannor! hold, he cry'd, “Not that—I cannot part with that”—and dy'd. And you! brave Cobham, to the latest breath, Shall feel your ruling Passion strong in death: Such in those moments, as in all the past, “Oh save my Country, Heav'n!” shall be your last. EPISTLE III. To the Right Honourable Allen Lord Bathurst. Of the use of Riches. That the true use of Riches is known to few, most falling into one of the Extremes, Avarice or Profusion. V. 1. &amp;c. Who shall decide, when Doctors disagree, And soundest Casuists doubt like you and me? You hold the Word, from Jove to Momus giv'n, That man was made the standing jest of heav'n, And Gold but sent to keep the fools in play, For half to heap, and half to throw away. But I, who think more highly of our kind, (And surely Heav'n and I are of a mind) Opine, that Nature, as in duty bound, Deep hid the shining mischief under ground: But when, by Man's audacious labour won, Flam'd forth this rival to its sire, the Sun, Then, in plain prose, were made two sorts of men, To squander some, and some to hide agen. Like Doctors thus, when much dispute has past, We find our Tenets just the same at last. Both fairly owning, Riches in effect No grace of Heav'n, or token of th'Elect; Giv'n to the Fool, the mad, the vain, the evil. V. 20. John Ward of Hackney, Esq; Member of Parliament, being prosecuted by the Duchess of Buckingham and convicted of Forgery, was first expelled the House, and then stood in the Pillory on the 17th of March 1727. He was suspected of joining in a Conveyance with Sir John Blunt to secrete fifty thousand pounds of that Director's estate, forfeited to the South-Sea company by act of Parliament. The Company recovered the fifty thousand pounds against Ward, but he set up prior conveyances of his real Estate to his Brother and Son, and conceal'd all his personal, which was computed to be one hundred and fifty thousand pounds: These Conveyances being also set aside by a Bill in Chancery, Ward was imprisoned, and hazarded the forfeiture of his life by not giving in his effects till the last day, which was that of his Examination. During his confinement, his amusement was to give poison to Dogs and Cats, and see them expire by slower or quicker torments. To sum up the Worth of this Gentleman at the several Æra's of his life: At his standing in the Pillory he was worth above two hundred thousand pounds; at his commitment to prison, he was worth one hundred and fifty thousand, but has been since so far diminished in his Reputation, as to be thought a worse man by fifty or sixty thousand. Fr. Chartres, a man infamous for all manner of vices. When he was an Ensign in the Army, he was drumm'd out of the regiment for a Cheat; he was next banish'd Brussels, and drumm'd out of Ghent on the same account. After a hundred tricks at the Gaming-tables, he took to lending of money at exorbitant interest and on great penalties, accumulating premium, interest, and capital into a new Capital, and seizing to a minute when the payments became due; in a word, by a constant attention to the Vices, Wants, and Follies of mankind, he acquired an immense fortune. His house was a perpetual Bawdy-house. He was twice condemn'd for Rapes, and pardoned; but the last time not without Imprisonment in Newgate, and large Confiscations. He died in Scotland in 1731, aged 62. The populace at his Funeral rais'd a great riot, almost tore the body out of the Coffin, and cast dead Dogs, &amp;c. into the grave with it. The following Epitaph contains his character very justly drawn by Dr. Arbuthnot. HERE continueth to rot/ The Body of FRANCIS CHARTRES/ Who with an Inflexible Constancy, and/ Inimitable Uniformity of Life,/ Persisted,/ In spite of Age and Infirmities,/ In the Practice of Every Humane Vice;/ Excepting Prodigality and Hypocrisy:/ His insatiable Avarice exempted him from the first,/ His matchless Impudence from the second./ Nor was he more singular in the un-deviating Pravity/ of his Manners, than successful in/ Accumulating Wealth,/ For, without Trade or Profession,/ Without Trust of Publick Money,/ And without Bribe-Worthy Service,/ He acquired, or more properly Created,/ A Ministerial Estate./ He was the only Person of his Time,/ Who cou'd Cheat without the Mask of Honesty,/ Retain his Primæval Meanness when possess'd of/ Ten Thousand a Year,/ And having daily deserv'd the Gibbet for what he did,/ Was at last condemn'd to it for what he could not do./ Oh Indignant Reader!/ Think not his Life useless to Mankind!/ Providence conniv'd at his execrable designs,/ To give to After-Ages a conspicuous/ Proof, and Example,/ Of how small estimation is Exorbitant Wealth/ in the sight of GOD, by his bestowing it on/ The most Unworthy of All Mortals./ This Gentleman was worth seven thousand pounds a year Estate in land, and about one hundred thousand in money. Mr. Waters, the third of these Worthies, was a man no way resembling the former in his military, but extremely so in his civil capacity; his great fortune having been rais'd by the like diligent attendance on the Necessities of others. But this Gentleman's History must be deferred till his death, when his Worth may be known more certainly.To Ward, to Waters, Chartres, and the Devil. V. 21. What Nature wants, &amp;c.] The Point discuss'd, whether the Invention of Money has been more commodious, or more pernicious to mankind?What Nature wants, commodious Gold bestows, 'Tis thus we eat the bread another sows: But how unequal it bestows, observe, 'Tis thus we riot, while who sow it starve. What Nature wants (a phrase I much distrust) Extends to Luxury, extends to Lust; And if we count among the needs of life Another's Toil, why not another's Wife? Useful, we grant, it serves what life requires, But dreadful too, the dark Assassin hires: Trade it may help, Society extend; But lures the Pyrate, and corrupts the Friend: It raises armies in a Nation's aid, But bribes a Senate, and the land's betray'd. Oh! that such bulky Bribes as all might see Still, as of old, encumber'd Villainy! In vain may Heroes fight, and Patriots rave, If secret Gold saps on from knave to knave. Could France or Rome divert our brave designs, With all their brandies, or with all their wines? What could they more than knights and squires confound, Or water all the Quorum ten miles round? A Statesman's slumbers how this speech would spoil! “Sir, Spain has sent a thousand jars of oyl; “Huge bales of British cloth blockade the door; “A hundred Oxon at your Levee roar. Poor Avarice one torment more would find, Nor could Profusion squander all, in kind. Astride his cheese Sir Morgan might we meet, V. 50. Some Misers of great wealth, proprietors of the Coal-mines, had enter'd at this time into an association to keep up coals to an extravagant price, whereby the Poor were reduced almost to starve; till one of them taking the advantage of underselling the rest, defeated the design. One of these Misers was worth ten thousand, another seven thousand a year.And Worldly crying coals from street to street, (Whom with a wig so wild, and mien so maz'd, Pity mistakes for some poor Tradesman craz'd.) V. 53. Colepeper.] Sir William Colepeper, Bart. a person of an ancient family and ample fortune without one other quaility of a Gentleman; who after ruining himself at the Gaming-table, past the rest of his days in sitting there to see the ruin of others; preferring to subsist upon borrowing and being, rather than to enter into any reputable method of life, and refusing a Post in the Army which was offer'd him.Had Colepeper's whole wealth been hops and hogs Could he himself have sent it to the dogs? His Grace will game: to White's a Bull be led, With spurning heels, and with a butting head; To White's be carry'd, as to ancient Games, Fair Coursers, Vases, and alluring Dames. Shall then Uxorio, if the stakes he sweep, Bear home six whores, and make his Lady weep? Or soft Adonis, so perfum'd and fine, Drive to St. James's a whole herd of Swine? Oh filthy check on all industrious skill, To spoil the Nation's last great Trade Quadrille! V. 65.—beneath the Patriot's Cloak.] This is a true story which happened in the reign of William III. to an unsuspected old Patriot, who coming out at the back-door from having been closeted by the King, where he had received a large bag of Guineas, the bursting of the bag discovered his business there.Once, we confess, beneath the Patriot's cloak, From the crack'd bagg the dropping Guinea spoke, And gingling down the back stairs, told the crew, “Old Cato is as great a rogue as you.” Blest Paper-credit! that advanc'd so high, Now lends Corruption lighter wings to fly! Gold, imp'd with this, can compass hardest things, V. 72.—fetch or carry Kings.] In our Author's time, many Princes had been sent about the world, and great Changes of Kings projected in Europe. The Partition-Treaty had dispos'd of Spain; France had set up a King for England, who was sent to Scotland, and back again; King Stanislaus was sent to Poland, and back again; the Duke of Anjou was sent to Spain; and Don Carlos to Italy.Can pocket States, or fetch or carry Kings; A single leaf can waft an Army o'er, V. 74. Or ship off Senates to some distant shore.] Alludes to several Ministers, Counsellors, and Patriots banished in our times to Siberia, and to that more glorious Fate of the Parliament of Paris, banished to Pontoise in the year 1720.Or ship off Senates to some distant shore; V. 75. A Leaf like Sybils. —Virg. Æn. 6.A leaf like Sybil's, scatters to and fro Our fates and fortunes as the winds shall blow; Pregnant with thousands flits the scrap unseen, And silent sells a King, or buys a Queen. Well then, since with the world we stand or fall, Come take it as we find it, Gold and all. V. 81. What Riches give us, &amp;c.] That Riches, either to the Avaricious or the Prodigal, cannot afford Necessaries, much less Happiness.What Riches give us, let us first enquire; Meat, fire, and cloaths. What more? meat, cloaths, and fire Is this too little? wou'd you more than live? V. 84. Turner.] One, who being possessed of three hundred thousand pounds, laid down his coach because Interest was reduced from 5 to 4 per cent. and then put seventy thousand into the Charitable Corporation for better interest: which sum having lost, he took it so much to heart, that he kept his chamber ever after. It is thought he would not have outliv'd it, but that he was Heir to another considerable Estate which he daily expected, and that by this course of life he sav'd both clothes and all other expences.Alas! 'tis more than Turner finds they give. Alas 'tis more than (all his Visions past) V. 86. Unhappy Wharton!] A Nobleman of great qualities, but as unfortunate in the application of them, as if they had been Vices and Follies. See his Character in the first Epistle of the second book.Unhappy Wharton, waking, found at last! V. 87. Hopkins.] A Citizen whose rapacity obtain'd him the name of Vultur Hopkins. He lived worthless, but died worth three hundred thousand pounds: which he would give to no person living, but left it so as not to be inherited till after the second Generation. His Counsel representing to him how many years it must be, before this could take effect, and that his money could only lie at interest all that time, he exprest great joy thereat, and said, “They would then be “as long in spending, as he had been in getting it.” But the Chancery afterwards set aside the Will, and gave it to the heir at law.What can they give? to dying Hopkins Heirs? V. 88. Japhet, Nose and Ears.] Japhet Crook, alias Sir Peter Stranger, was punished with the loss of those parts, for having forged a Conveyance of an Estate to himself, upon which he took up several thousand pounds. He was at the same time sued in chancery for having fraudulently obtain'd a Will, by which he possess'd another considerable Estate, in wrong of the Brother of the deceas'd. By these means he was worth a great sum, which (in reward for the small loss of his Ears) he enjoy'd in prison till his death, and quietly left to his Executor.To Chartres Vigour, Japhet Nose and ears? Can they in gems bid pallid Hippia glow, In Fulvia's buckle ease the throbs below, Or heal, old Narses, thy obscener ail, With all th'embroid'ry plaister'd at thy tail? They might, (were Harpax not too wise to spend) Give Harpax self the blessing of a Friend; Or find some Doctor that would save the life Of wretched Shylock, spite of Shylock's Wife; But thousands die, without or this or that, V. 98. Die, and endow a College, or a Cat.] A famous Dutchess of R. in her last Will left considerable legacies and annuities to her Cats.Die, and endow a College, or a Cat: To some indeed heav'n grants the happier fate T'enrich a bastard, or a son they hate. Perhaps you think the Poor might have their part? V. 102. Bond damns the Poor— But Reverend S??n with a softer air Admits, and leaves them, Providence's care. In the year 1730, a Corporation was established to lend money to the Poor upon pledges, by the name of the Charitable Corporation. It was under the direction of the Right Honourable Sir R. S. Sir Arch. Grant, Mr. Denis Bond, Mr. Burroughs, &amp;c. But the whole was turned only to an iniquitous method of enriching particular people, to the ruin of such numbers, that it became a Parliamentray concern to endeavour the relief of those unhappy sufferers, and three of the Managers, who were Members of the House, were expelled. That “God hates the Poor, and That every man in want is Knave or Fool, &amp;c.” were the genuine Apothegmes of some of the persons here mentioned. Bond damns the poor, and hates them from his heart: The grave Sir Gilbert holds it for a rule, That “every man in want is knave or fool: “God cannot love (says Blunt, with lifted eyes) “The wretch he starves”—and piously denies: But rev'rend S??n with a softer air, Admits, and leaves them, Providence's care. Yet, to be just to these poor men of pelf, V. 110. Each does but hate, &amp;c.] That Avarice is an absolute Frenzy, without an End or Purpose. Conjectures about the Motives of avaricious Men.Each does but hate his Neighbour as himself: Damn'd to the Mines, and equal fate betides The slave that digs it, and the slave that hides. Who suffer thus, meer charity should own Must act on motives pow'rful tho' unknown: Some War, some Plague, some Famine they foresee, Some Revelation, hid from you and me. Why Shylock wants a meal, the cause is found, He thinks a loaf will rise to fifty pound. What made Directors cheat in South-sea year? V. 120. To live on Ven'son,] In the extravagance and luxury of the South-sea year, the price of a haunch of venison was from three to five pounds.To live on ven'son when it sold so dear. As you why Phryne the whole Auction buys? V. 122.—A General Excise.] Many people about the year 1733, had a conceit that such a thing was intended, of which it is not improbable this Lady might have some intimation. Phryne foresees a General Excise, Why she and Sapho raise that monstrous sum? Alas! they fear a Man will cost a plum. V. 125. Wise Peter.] Peter Walter, a person not only eminent in the Wisdom of his Profession, as a dextrous Attorney, but allow'd to be a good, if not a safe, Conveyancer; extremely respected by the Nobility of this land, tho' free from all manner of Luxury and Ostenation: His Wealth was never seen, and his Bounty never heard of; except to his own son, for whom he procur'd an Employment of considerable profit, of which he gave him as much as was necessary. Therefore the taxing this Gentleman with any Ambition, is certainly a great wrong to him.Wise Peter sees the World's respect for Gold, And therefore hopes this Nation may be sold: Glorious Ambition! Peter, swell thy store, V. 128. Rome's great Didius.] A Roman Lawyer, so rich as to purchase the Empire when it was set to sale upon the death of Pertinax.And be what Rome's great, Didius was before. V. 129. The Crown of Poland, &amp;c.] The two Persons here mentioned were of Quality, each of whom in the time of the Missisipi despis'd to realize above three hundred thousand pounds: The Gentleman with a view to the purchase of the Crown of Poland, the Lady on a Vision of the like Royal nature. They since retired into Spain, where they are still in search of Gold in the mines of the Asturies.The Crown of Poland, venal twice an age, To just three millions stinted modest Gage. But nobler scenes Maria's dreams unfold, Hereditary Realms, and worlds of gold. Congenial souls! whose life one Av'rice joins, And one fate buries in th'Asturian Mines. V. 135. Much injur'd Blunt.] Sir John Blunt, originally a Scrivener, was one of the first Projectors of the South-sea Company, and afterwards one of the Directors and chief Managers of the famous Scheme in 1720. He was also one of those who suffer'd most severely by the Bill of Pains and Penalties on the said Directors. He was a Dissenter of a most religious deportment, and profess'd to be a great Believer. Whether he did really credit the Prophecy here mentioned is not certain, but it was constantly in this style he declaimed against the Corruption and Luxury of the Age, the partiality of Parliaments, and the misery of Party-Spirit. He was particularly eloquent against Avarice in Great and Noble Persons, of which he had indeed liv'd to see many miserable Examples. He died in the year 1732.Much injur'd Blunt! why bears he Britain's hate? A Wizard told him in these words our fate. “At length, Corruption, like a gen'ral flood, “(So long by watchful Ministers withstood) “Shall deluge all; and Av'rice creeping on “Spread like a low-born mist, and blot the Sun: “Statesman and Patriot ply alike the stocks; “Peeress and Butler share alike the Box; “The Judge shall job, the Bishop bite the town, “And mighty Dukes pack cards for half a crown: “See Britain sunk in Lucre's sordid charms, “And France reveng'd of Anne's and Edward's Arms!” No gay Court-badge, great Scriv'ner! fir'd thy brain, Nor Lordly Luxury, nor City Gain: No, 'twas thy righteous end, asham'd to see Senates degen'rate, Patriots disagree, And nobly wishing Party-rage to cease, To buy both sides, and give thy Country peace. All this is madness, cries a sober Sage: But who, my friend, has reason in his Rage? “The ruling Passion, be it what it will, “The ruling Passion conquers reason still. Less mad the wildest whimsey we can frame, Than ev'n that passion, if it has no aim; For tho' such motives folly you may call, The folly's greater to have none at all. V. 161, &amp;c. That the Conduct of Men with respect to Riches, can only be accounted for by the Order of Providence, which works the General Good out of Extremes, and brings all to its Great End by perpetual Revolutions. See Book 1. Epist. 2. V. 155, &amp;c. 197.Hear then the truth: “'Tis Heav'n each Passion sends, “And diff'rent men directs to diff'rent ends. “Extremes in Nature equal good produce, “Extremes in Man concur to genral use. Ask we what makes one keep, and one bestow? That Pow'r who bids the Ocean ebb and flow, Bids seed-time, harvest, equal course maintain, Thro' reconcil'd extremes of drought and rain, Builds Life on death, on Change duration founds, And gives th'eternal wheels to know their rounds. Riches, like Insects, when conceal'd they lie, Wait but for wings, and in their season, fly. Who sees pale Mammon pine amidst his store, Sees but a backward Steward for the poor; This year a Reservoir, to keep and spare, The next, a Fountain spouting thro' his Heir, In lavish streams to quench a Country's thirst, And men, and dogs, shall drink him till they burst. Old Cotta sham'd his Fortune, and his Birth, V. 180, &amp;c. How a Miser acts upon Principles which appear to him reasonable.Yet was not Cotta void of wit, or worth: What tho' (the use of barb'rous spits forgot) His kitchen vy'd in coolness with his Grot? His court with nettles, moat with cresses stor'd, V. 184. With soups unbought.] ? dapibus mensas onerabat inemptis. Virg.With soups unbought, and sallads, blest his board. If Cotta liv'd on pulse, it was no more Than Bramins, Saints, and Sages did before; To cram the rich, was prodigal expence, And who would take the poor from Providence? Like some lone Chartreuse stands the good old hall, Silence without, and fasts within the wall; No rafter'd roofs with dance and tabor sound; No noontide-bell invites the country round; Tenants with sights the smoakless towr's survey, And turn th'unwilling Steed another way: Benighted wanderers, the forest o'er, Curse the sav'd candle, and unopening door; While the gaunt mastiff, growling at the gate, Affrights the beggar whom he longs to eat. V. 199. How a Prodigal does the same.Not so his Son; he mark'd this oversight, And then mistook reverse of wrong for right; For what to shun will no great knowledge need, But what to follow, is a task indeed. Whole slaughter'd hecatombs, and floods of wine, Fill the capacious Squire, and deep Divine. Yet no mean motive this profusion draws, His Oxen perish in his Country's cause: 'Tis George and Liberty that crowns the cup, And Zeal for that great House which eats him up. The woods recede around the naked seat, The Sylvans groan—no matter—for the Fleet. Next goes his wool, to clothe our valiant bands, Last, for his Country's love, he sells his lands. To town he comes, compleats the nation's hope, And heads the bold Train-bands, and burns a Pope. And shall not Britain now reward his toils? (Britain, that pays her Patriots with her Spoils?) In vain at Court the Bankrupt pleads his cause, His thankless country leaves him to her Laws. V. 219. The due Medium and true Use of Riches.The Sense to value riches, with the Art T'enjoy them, and the Virtue to impart, Not meanly, nor ambitiously persu'd Not sunk by sloth, nor rais'd by servitude; To balance Fortune by a just expence, Join with Oeconomy, Magnificence, With splendor, charity, with plenty, health; Oh teach us, Bathurst! yet unspoild by wealth! That secret rare, between th'extremes to move Of mad Good-nature, and of mean Self-love. To Want, or Worth, well-weigh'd, be bounty giv'n, And ease, or emulate, the care of Heav'n. Whose measure full o'erflows on human race, Mends fortune's fault, and justifies her grace. Wealth in the gross is death, but life diffus'd, As Poison heals, in just proportion us'd: In heaps, like Ambergrise, a stink it lies, But well dispers'd, is Incence to the skies. Who starves by Nobles, or with Nobles eats? The Wretch that trusts them, and the Rogue that cheats. Is there a Lord, who knows a chearful noon Without a Fidler, Flatt'rer, or Buffoon? Whose table, Wit, or modest Merit share, Un-elbow'd by a Gamester, Pimp, or Play'r? V. 243. Oxford's better part.] Edward Harley Earl of Oxford, the Son of Robert, created Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer by Queen Anne.Who copies Yours, or Oxford's better part, To ease th'oppress'd, and raise the sinking heart? Where-e'er he shines, oh Fortune gild the scene, And Angels guard him in the Golden Mean! There, English Bounty yet a while may stand, And Honour linger, e're it leaves the land. But all our praises why should Lords engross? V. 250, &amp;c. The Man of Ross.] The Person here celebrated, who with so small an estate actually performed all these good works, and whose true Name was almost lost (partly by the Title of the Man of Ross given him by way of eminence, and partly by being buried without so much as an Inscription) was called Mr. John Kyrle. He died in the year 1724, aged 90, and lies interr'd in the Chancel of the Church of Ross in Herefordshire. Rise honest Muse! and sing the Man of Ross: Pleas'd Vaga ecchoes thro' her winding bounds, And rapid Severn hoarse applause resounds. Who hung with woods yon mountain's sultry brow? From the dry rock who bade the waters flow? Not to the skies in useless columns tost, Or in proud falls magnificently lost, But clear and artless, pouring thro' the plain Health to the sick, and solace to the swain. Whose cause-way parts the vale with shady rows? Whose seats the weary Traveller repose? Who taught that heav'n directed Spire to rise? The Man of Ross, each lisping babe replies. Behold the Market-place with poor o'erspread! The Man of Ross divides the weekly bread: He feeds yon Alms-house, neat, but void of state, Where Age and Want sit smiling at the gate: Him portion'd maids, apprentic'd orphans blest, The young who labour, and the old who rest. Is any sick? the Man of Ross relieves, Prescribes, attends, the med'cine makes, and gives. Is there a variance? enter but his door, Balk'd are the Courts, and contest is no more. Despairing Quacks with curses fled the place, And vile Attornies, now an useless race. “Thrice happy man! enabled to persue “What all so wish, but want the pow'r to do. “Oh say, what sums that gen'rous hand supply? “What mines, to swell that boundless charity? Of debts and taxes, wife and children clear, This man possest—five hundred pounds a year, Blush Grandeur, blush! proud Courts withdraw your blaze! Ye little Stars! hide your diminished rays. “And what? no monument, inscription, stone? “His race, his form, his name almost unknown? Who builds a Church to God, and not to Fame, Will never mark the marble with his name: Go search it there The Parish Register., where to be born and die, Of rich and poor makes all the history; Enough, that Virtue fill'd the space between; Prov'd, by the Ends of Being, to have been. When Hopkins dies, a thousand lights attend The wretch, who living sav'd a candle's end: Should'ring God's alter a vile image stands, Belies his features, nay extends his hands, That live-long wig which Gorgon's self might own, V. 296. Eternal buckle takes in Parian stone.] ridicules the wretched taste of carving large perriwigs on Busto's, of which there are several vile examples in the Tombs at Westminster and elsewhere.Eternal buckle takes in Parian stone. Behold what blessings Wealth to life can lend! And see, what comfort it affords our end. V. 299, &amp;c. The Fate of the Profuse and the Covetous, in two Examples: both miserable, in Life, and in Death.In the worst Inn's worst room, with mat half-hung The floors of plaister, and the walls of dung. On once a flockbed, but repair'd with straw, With tape-ty'd curtains never meant to draw, The George and Garter dangling from that bed Where tawdry yellow strove with dirty red, V. 305. George Villers, Duke of Buckingham, who died in this manner.Great Villers lies—alas! how chang'd from him, That life of pleasure, and that soul of whim! Gallant and gay, in Cliveden's proud alcove, The bow'r of wanton Shrewsbury and love; Or just as gay, at Council, in a ring Of mimick'd Statesmen, and their merry King. No Wit to flatter, left of all his store! No Fool to laugh at, which he valued more. There, victor of his health, of fortune, friends, And fame, this lord of useless thousands ends. His Grace's fate sage Cutler could foresee, And well (he thought) advis'd him, “Live like me.” As well his Grace reply'd, “Like you, Sir John? “That I can do, when all I have is gone.” Resolve me, Reason, which of these is worse, Want with a full, or with an empty purse? Thy life more wretched, Cutler, was confess'd, Arise and tell me, was thy death more bless'd? Cutler saw tenants break, and houses fall, For very want; he could not build a wall. His only daughter in a stranger's pow'r, For very want; he could not pay a dow'r. A few grey hairs his rev'rend temples crown'd, For very want, he sold them for two pound. What ev'n deny'd a cordial at his end, Banish'd the doctor, and expell'd the friend? What but a want, which you perhaps think mad Yet numbers feel, the want of what he had. Cutler and Brutus, dying both exclaim, “Virtue! and Wealth! what are ye but a name? Say, for such worth are other worlds prepar'd? Or are they both, in this, their own reward? That knotty point, my Lord, shall I discuss, Or tell a Tale?—A Tale—it follows thus. V. 339. Where London's Column.] The Monument built in memory of the Fire of London, with an Inscription importing that City to have been burnt by the Papists.Where London's Column pointing at the skies, Like a tall bully, lifts the head and lyes; There dwelt a Citizen of sober fame, A plain good man, and Balaam was his name. Religious, punctal, frugal, and so forth; His word would pass for more than he was worth. One solid dish his week-day meal affords, An added pudding solemniz'd the Lord's, Constant at Church, and Change; his gains were sure, His givings rare, save farthings to the poor. The Dev'l was piqu'd, such saintship to behold, And long'd to tempt him like good Job of old: But Satan now is wiser than of yore, And tempts by making rich, not making poor. Rouz'd by the Prince of Air, the whirlwinds sweep The surge, and plunge, his Father in the deep; Then full against his Cornish lands they roar, And two rich ship-wrecks blest the lucky shore. Sir Balaam now, he lives like other folks. He takes his chirping pint, he cracks his jokes: “Live like your self,” was soon my Lady's word; And lo! two puddings smoak'd upon the board. Asleep and naked as an Indian lay, An honest Factor stole a Gem away: He pledg'd it to the knight; the knight had wit, So kept the Diamond, and the rogue was bit. Some Scruple rose, but thus he eas'd his thought, “I'll now give six-pence where I gave a groat, “Where once I went to church, I'll now go twice— “And am so clear too of all other vice.” The Tempter saw his time? the work he ply'd; Stocks and Subscriptions pour on ev'ry side, Till all the Dæmon makes his full descent In one abundant show'r of Cent. per Cent, Sinks deep within him, and possesses whole, Then dubs Director, and secures his soul. Behold Sir Balaam, now a man of spirit, Ascribes his gettings to his parts and merit; What late he call'd a Blessing, now was Wit, And God's good Providence, a lucky Hit. Things change their titles, as our manners turn: His Compting-house imploy'd the sunday-morn; Seldom at Church, (twas such a busy life) But duly sent his family and Wife. There (so the Dev'l ordain'd) one Christmas-tide My good old Lady catch'd a cold, and dy'd. A Nymph of Quality admires our Knight; He marries, bows at Court, and grows polite: Leaves the dull cits, and joins (to please the fair) The well-bred cuckolds in St. James's Air: First, for his Son a gay Commission buys, Who drinks, whores, fights, and in a duel dies. His Daughter flaunts a Viscount's tawdry wife, She bears a Coronet and p?x for life. In Britain's Senate he a seat obtains, V. 358. And one more Pensioner St. Stephen gains.] ? atque unum civem donare Sybillæ. Juv.And one more Pensioner St. Stephen gains. My Lady falls to Play: so bad her chance, He must repair it; takes a bribe from France; The House impeach him, Conningsby harangues, The Court forsake him, and Sir Balaam hangs: Wife, son, and daughter, Satan are thy own; His wealth, yet dearer, forfeit to the Crown; The Devil and the King divide the prize, And sad Sir Balaam curses God and dies. EPISTLE IV. TO Richard Earl of Burlington. This Epistle is a Corollary to the preceding; As that treated of the Extremes of Avarice and Profusion, this takes up one branch of the latter, the Vanity of Expence in people of Quality or Fortune. 'Tis strange, the Miser should his cares employ, To gain those Riches he can ne'er enjoy. Is it less strange, the Prodigal should waste His wealth, to purchase what he ne'er can taste? Not for himself he sees, or hears, or eats; Artists must chuse his Pictures, Music, Meats: V. 7. Topham.] A Gentleman famous for a judicious collection of drawings.He buys for Topham Drawings and designs, For Fountain Statues, and for Pembroke Coins, Rare monkish Manuscripts for Hearne alone, V. 10. And Books for Mead, and Rarities for Sloane.] Two eminent Physicians; the one had an excellent Library, the other the finest Collection in Europe of natural curiosities; both men of great learning and humanity.And Books for Mead, and Rarities for Sloane. Think we all these are for himself? no more Than his fine Wife, alas! or finer Whore. For what has Virro painted, built, and planted? Only to show, how many Tastes he wanted. V. 15. The abuse of the word Taste.What brought Sir Visto's ill-got wealth to waste? Some Dæmon whisper'd, “Visto! have a Taste. Heav'n visits with a Taste the wealthy fool, And needs no rod but Ripley with a Rule. See! sportive fate, to punish aukward pride, Bids Bubo build, and sends him such a guide: A standing sermon, at each year's expence, That never Coxcomb reach'd Magnificence! V. 23. The Earl of Burlington was then publishing the designs of Inigo Jones, and the Antiquities of Rome by Palladio.You show us, Rome was glorious, not profuse, And pompous buildings once were things of Use. Yet shall (my Lord) your just, your noble rules Fill half the land with Imitating Fools: Who random drawings from your sheets shall take, And of one beauty many blunders make; Load some vain Church with old Theatric state, Turn Arcs of triumph to a Garden-gate; Reverse your ornaments and hang them all On some patch'd dog-hole ek'd with ends of wall, Then clap four slices of Pilaster on't, That, lac'd with bits of rustic, makes a Front. Shall call the winds thro' long Arcades to roar, V. 36. A Door or window, so call'd, from being much practised at Venice, by Palladio and others.Proud to catch cold at a Venetian door; Conscious they act a true Palladian part, And if they starve, they starve by rules of art. V. 39, &amp;c. That the first principle and foundation of all Taste, is Good Sense.Oft have you hinted to your brother Peer, A certain truth, which many buy too dear: Something there is, more needful than Expence, And something previous ev'n to Taste—'Tis Sense: Good Sense, which only is the gift of heav'n, And tho' no science, fairly worth the seven: A light, which in yourself you must perceive; V. 46. Inigo Jones, the celebrated Architect, and M. Le Nôtre, the Designer of the best Gardens of France. Jones and Le Nôtre have it not to give. V. 47, &amp;c. The chief proof of good Sense in this, as in every thing else, is to follow Nature, but with Judgment, and Choice.To build, to plant, to whatever you intend, To rear the Column, or the Arch to bend, To swell the Terras, or to sink the Grot; In all let Nature, never be forgot. But treat the Goddess like a modest fair, Nor over-dress, nor leave her wholly bare; Let not each beauty ev'ry where be spy'd, Where half the skill is decently to hide. He gains all points, who pleasingly confounds, Surprizes, varies, and conceals the Bounds. V. 57, &amp;c. The first Rule, to adapt all to the Nature and Use of the Place, and the beauties not forced into it but resulting from it.Consult the Genius of the place in all; That tells the Waters or to rise, or fall, Or helps th'ambitious Hill the heav'ns to scale, Or scoops in circling Theatres the Vale, Calls in the Country, catches opening glades, Joins willing woods, and varies shades from shades, Now breaks, or now directs, th'intending lines; Paints as you plant, and as you work, designs. Begin with Sense, of ev'ry Art the soul, Parts answ'ring parts shall slide into a Whole, Spontaneous beauties all around advance, Start ev'n from Difficulty, strike from Chance; Nature shall join you, Time shall make it grow V. 70. The Seat and Gardens of the Lord Viscount Cobham in Buckinghamshire.A Work to wonder at—perhaps a Stow. V. 71, &amp;c. For want of this Sense, and thro' neglect of this Rule, men are disappointed in the most expensive undertakings. Nothing without this will ever please long, if it pleases at all.Without it, proud Versailles! thy glory falls, And Nero's Terraces desert their walls: The vast Parterres a thousand hands shall make, Lo! Cobham comes, and floats them with a Lake: V. 75. Or cut wide views thro' Mountains.] This was done in Hertfordshire by a wealthy Citizen, at the expence of above 5000]. by which means (meerly to overlook a dead Plain) he let in the Northwind upon his House and Parterre, which were before adorned and defended by beautiful woods.Or cut wide views thro' mountains to the plain, You'll wish your hill or shelter'd seat again. Behold Villario's ten-years toil compleat, His Arbours darken, his Espaliers meet, The Wood supports the Plain, the parts unite, And strength of shade contends with strength of light; A waving glow the bloomy beds display, Blushing in bright diversities of day, With silver-quiv'ring rills mæander'd o'er— Enjoy them, you! Villario can no more; Tir'd of the scene parterres and fountains yield, He finds at last he better likes a Field. Thro' his young woods how pleas'd Sabinus stray'd, Or sate delighted in the thick'ning shade, With annual joy the red'ning shoots to greet, Or see the stretching branches long to meet! His Son's fine taste an op'ner vista loves, Foe to the Dryads of his Father's groves, V. 93. The two Extremes in Parterre which are equally faulty, a boundless Green large and naked as a field, or a flourish'd Carpet where the greatness and nobleness of the piece is lessened by being divided into too many parts, which scroll'd works and beds; of both which the examples are frequent.One boundless Green, or flourish'd Carpet views, V. 94.—mournful family of Yews.] Touches upon the ill taste of those who are so fond of Evergreens (particularly Yews which are the most tonsile) as to destroy the nobler Forest-trees, to make way for such little ornaments as Pyramids of dark green, continually repeated, not unlike a Funeral procession.With all the mournful family of Yews; The thriving plants ignoble broomsticks made, Now sweep those alleys they were born to shade. V. 97. At Timon's Villa.] This description is intended to comprize the Principles of a false Taste of Magnificence, and to exemplify what was said before, that nothing but good Sense can attain it.At Timon's Villa let us pass a day, Where all cry out, “what sums are thrown away! So proud, so grand, of that stupendous air, V. 100, &amp;c. The first wrong Principle, is to imagine true Greatness consists in size and dimension: whereas, let the work be ever so vast, unless the parts cohere in one harmony, it will be but a great many littlenesses put together. Soft and Agreeable come never there. Greatness, with Timon, dwells in such a draught As brings all Brobdignag before your thought. To compass this, his building is a Town, His pond an Ocean, his parterre a Down: Who but must laugh, the Master when he sees; A puny insect, shiv'ring at a breeze. Lo! what huge heaps of littleness around! The whole, a labour'd Quarry above ground. V. 109. The second Error, Disproportion, small things joined to large ones.Two Cupids squirt before: a Lake behind Improves the keenness of the Northern wind. His Gardens next your admiration call, V. 112. The Ends and Bouuds being seen at once, which however large, will diminish both of the Grandeur and the Surprize.On ev'ry side you look, behold the Wall! No pleasing intricacies intervene, No artful wildness to perplex the scene; V. 115. Too exact Resemblance of part to part, and Repetition of the same Objects.Grove nods at grove, each alley has a brother, And half the platform just reflects the other. V. 117. Figuers unnatural, stiff and formal, or such as cannot be made perfect.The suff'ring eye inverted nature sees, Trees cut to Statues, Statues thick as trees, V. 119, &amp;c. Ornaments of building or sculpture, either too much multiplied, or ill-placed, or where Nature does not favour 'em. All the examples are taken from some known Gardens.With here a Fountain never to be play'd, And there a Summer-house, that knows no shade. Here Amphitrite sails thro' myrtle bow'rs; V. 122. The two Statues, of the Gladiator pugnans, and Gladiator moriens.There Gladiators fight, or die in flow'rs; Un-water'd see the drooping sea-horse mourn, And swallows rooft in Nilus' dusty urn. My Lord advances with majestic mien, Smit with the mighty pleasure, to be seen: But soft—by regular approach—not yet— V. 128. The Approaches and Communications of House with Garden, or of one part with another, ill judged and inconvenient.First thro' the length of yon hot Terrace sweat, And when up ten steep slopes you've dragg'd your thighs, Just at his Study-door he'll bless your eyes. V. 131. His Study, &amp;c.] The false Taste in Books, a satire on the vanity in collecting them, more frequent in men of fortune, than the study to understand them. Many delight chiefly in the elegance of the print, or of the binding; some have carry'd it so far, as to cause the upper shelves to be filled with painted books of wood: others pipue themselves so much upon books in a language they do not understand, as to exclude the most useful in one they do.His Study? with what Authors is it stor'd? In Books, not Authors, curious is my Lord; To all their dated Backs he turns you round, These Aldus printed, those Du Suëil has bound. Lo some are Vellom, and the rest as good For all his Lordship knows, but they are Wood. For Lock or Milton 'tis in vain to look, These shelves admit not any modern book. And now the Chappel's silver bell you hear, V. 140. The false Taste in Music, improper to the subjects, as of light Airs in Churches, often practised by the Organists, &amp;c.That summons you to all the Pride of Pray'r: Light quirks of Musick, broken and uneven, Make the soul dance upon a jig to heaven. V. 143.—And in Painting (from which even Italy is not free) of naked Figures in churches, &amp;c. which has obliged some Popes to put Draperies on some of those of the best Masters.On painted Cielings you devoutly stare, V. 144. Verrio (Antonio) painted many Cielings, &amp;c. at Windsor, Hampton Court, &amp;c. and Laguerre at Blenheim-Castle, and other places.Where sprawl the faints of Verrio, or Laguerre, On gilded clouds in fair expansion lie, And bring all Paradise before your eye. V. 147. This is a fact, a Reverend Dean preaching at Court, threatned the Sinner with punishment in “a place which he thought it not decent to name in so polite an assembly.”To rest, the Cushion and soft Dean invite, Who never mentions Hell to ears polite. But hark! the chiming clocks to dinner call; A hundred footsteps scrape the marble hall: V. 151. taxes the Incongruity of Ornaments (tho' sometimes practised by the Ancients) where a distorted mouth ejects the water into a Fountain, or where the shocking images of Serpents, &amp;c. are introduced in Grottos, or Buffets.The rich Buffet well-colour'd Serpents grace, And gaping Tritons spew to wash your face. V. 153. Is this a Dinner? &amp;c.] The proud Festivals of some men are here set forth to ridicule, where the Pride destroys the ease, and the formal Regularity all the pleasurable enjoyment of the entertainment.Is this a dinner? this a genial room? No, 'tis a Temple, and a hecatomb; A solemn sacrifice, perform'd in state, You drink by measure, and to minutes eat. So quick retires each flying course, you'd swear V. 158. Sancho's dread Doctor.] See Don Quixote, Vol. 4. Chap. 6. Sancho's dread Doctor and his wand were there. Between each act the trembling salvers ring, From soup to sweetwine, and God bless the King. In plenty starving, tantaliz'd in state, And complaisantly help'd to all I hate, Treated, caress'd, and tir'd, I take my leave, Sick of his civil Pride from morn to eve! I curse such lavish cost, and little skill, And swear no day was ever past so ill. V. 167, &amp;c. The Moral of the whole, where Providence is justified in giving wealth to those who squander it in this manner. A bad Taste employs more hands, and diffuses expence, more than a good one. This recurs to what is laid down in Book 1. Epist. 2. v. 230–7, and in the Epistle preceding this, v. 161, &amp;c.Yet hence the Poor are cloath'd, the Hungry fed; Health to himself, and to his Infants bread The Lab'rer bears: What his hard heart denies, His charitable Vanity supplies. Another age shall see the golden ear Imbrown the slope, and nod on the Parterre. Deep harvests bury all his pride has plann'd, And laughing Ceres re-assume the land. Who then shall grace, or who improve the Soil? Who plants like Bathurst, or who builds like Boyle. 'Tis Use alone that sanctifies Expence, And Splendor borrows all her rays from Sense. His Father's Acres who enjoys in peace, Or makes his Neighbours glad, if he encrease; Whose chearful Tenants bless their yearly toil, Yet to their lord owe more than to the soil; Whose ample Lawns are not asham'd to feed The milky heifer and deserving steed; Whose rising Forests, not for pride or show, But future buildings, future Navies grow; Let His plantations stretch from down to down, First shade a Country, and then raise a Town. You too proceed! make falling Arts your care, Erect new wonders, and the old repair, Jones and Palladio to themselves restore, And be whate'er Vitruvius was before: V. 193. 195, &amp;c. Till Kings.—Bid Harbors open, &amp;c.] The Poet after having touched upon the proper objects of Magnificence and Expence, in the private Works of Great Men, comes to those great and publick Works which become a Prince. This Poem was published in the year 1732: when some of the new built Churches, by the Act of Q. Anne, were ready to fall, being founded in boggy land, and others vilely executed, thro' fraudulent cabals between Undertakers, Officers, &amp;c. when Dagenham-Breach had done very great mischiefs; when the Proposal of building a Bridge at Westminster had been petitioned against, and rejected; when many of the High-ways throughout England were hardly passable, and most of those which were repaired by Turnpikes, made Jobbs for private Lucre, and infamously executed, even to the Entrances of London itself. There had, at this time, been an uninterrupted Peace in Europe for above twenty years.Till Kings call forth th'Idea's of your mind, Proud to accomplish what such hands design'd, Bid Harbors open, public Ways extend, Bid Temples, worthier of the God, ascend, Bid the broad Arch the dang'rous flood contain, The Mole projected break the roaring Main; Back to his bounds their subject Sea command, And roll obedient Rivers thro' the Land: These Honours, Peace to happy Britain brings, These are Imperial Works, and worthy Kings. EPISTLES, THE Third Book. TO SEVERAL PERSONS. EPISTLE I. TO ROBERT Earl of OXFORD AND Earl Mortimer. Such were the notes thy once-lov'd Poet sung, This Epistle was sent to the Earl of Oxford with Dr. Parnelle's Poems published by our Author, after the said Earl's Imprisonment in the Tower, and Retreat into the Country. 'Till death untimely stop'd his tuneful tongue. Oh just beheld, and lost! admir'd and mourn'd! With softest manners, gentlest arts ardorn'd! Blest in each science, blest in ev'ry strain! Dear to the Muse! to Harley dear—in vain! For him, thou oft has bid the world attend, Fond to forget the statesman in the friend; For Swift and him, despise the farce of state, The sober follies of the wise and great; Dextrous, the craving, fawning croud to quit, And pleas'd escape from Flattery to Wit. Absent or dead, still let a friend be dear, (A sigh the absent claims, the dead a tear) Recall those nights that clos'd thy toilsome days, Still hear thy Parnell in his living lays, Who careless now of Interest, fame, or fate, Perhaps forgets that Oxford e'er was great; Or deeming meanest what we greatest call, Behold thee glorious only in thy Fall. And sure, if ought below the seats divine Can touch Immortals, 'tis a soul like thine: A soul supreme, in each hard instance try'd, Above all pain, all Passion, and all Pride, The rage of Pow'r, the blast of publick breath, The lust of Lucre, and the dread of Death. In vain to desarts thy retreat is made; The Muse attends thee to the silent shade: 'Tis hers, the brave man's latest steps to trace, Rejudge his acts and dignify disgrace. When Int'rest calls off all her sneaking train, And all th'oblig'd desert, and all the vain; She waits, or to the scaffold, or the cell, When the last ling'ring friend has bid farewel. Ev'n now, she shades thy Ev'ning walk with bays, (No hireling she, no prostitute to praise) Ev'n now, observant of the parting ray, Eyes the calm sun-set of thy various day, Thro' Fortune's cloud one truly great can see, Nor fears to tell, that Mortimer is he. EPISTLE II. TO James Craggs, Esq; Secretary of State. A soul as full of Worth, as void of Pride, Which nothing seeks to show, or needs to hide, Which nor to guilt, nor fear, its Caution owes, And boasts a Warmth that from no passion flows: A Face untaught to feign! a judging eye, That darts severe upon a rising lye, And strikes a blush thro' frontless Flattery. All this thou wert; and being this before, Know, Kings and Fortune cannot make thee more. Then scorn to gain a Friend by servile ways Nor wish to lose a Foe these virtues raise; But candid, free, sincere, as you began, Proceed—a Minister, but still a Man; Be not (exalted to whate'er degree) Asham'd of any Friend, not ev'n of Me. The Patriot's plain, but untrod path pursue; If not, 'tis I must be asham'd of You. EPISTLE III. TO Mr. Addison. See the wild waste of all devouring years! This was written in 1715, at which time Mr. Addison intended to publish his Book of Medals. It was some time before he was Secretary of State, but not printed till Mr. Tickell's Edition of his Works, at which time the Verses on Mr. Craggs, which conclude the poem, were added, viz. in 1720. How Rome her own sad Sepulchre appears, With nodding arches, broken temples spread, The very tombs now vanish'd like their dead! Imperial wonders, rais'd on Nations spoil'd, Where mix'd with slaves the groaning Martyr toil'd: Huge Theatres, that now unpeopled woods, Now drain'd a distant country of her floods; Fanes, which admiring Gods with pride survey; Statues of men, scarce less alive than they; Some felt the silent stroke of mould'ring age. Some hostile fury, some religious rage; Barbarian blindness, Christian zeal conspire, And Papal piety, and Gothic fire, Perhaps, by its own ruins sav'd from flame, Some bury'd marble half preserves a Name, That name, the learn'd with fierce disputes pursue, And give to Titus old Vespasian's due. Ambition sigh'd: She found it vain to trust The faithless column and the crumbling bust; Huge Moles, whose shadow stretch'd from shore to shore, Their ruins ruin'd, and their place no more! Convinc'd, she now contracts her vast design, And all her triumphs shrink into a Coin: A narrow orb each crouded conquest keeps, Beneath her palm here sad Judæa weeps. Now scantier limits the proud Arch confine, And scarce are seen the prostrate Nile or Rhine, A small Euphrates thro' the piece is roll'd, And little Eagles wave their wings in gold. The Medal, faithful to its charge of fame, Thro' climes and ages bears each form and name: In one short view subjected to our eye Gods, Emp'rors, Heroes, Sages, Beauties lie. With sharpen'd sight pale Antiquaries pore, Th'inscription value, but the rust adore; This the blue varnish, that the green endears, The sacred rust of twice ten hundred years! To gain Pescennius one employs his schemes, One grasps a Cecrops in ecstatic dreams; Poor Vadius, long with learned spleen devour'd, Can taste no pleasure since his Shield was scour'd; And Curio, restless by the fair one's side, Sighs for an Otho, and neglects his Bride. Theirs is the Vanity, the Learning thine: Touch'd by thy hand, again Rome's glories shine, Her Gods, and god-like Heroes rise to view, And all her faded garlands bloom a-new. Nor blush, these studies thy regard engage; These pleas'd the Fathers of poetic rage; The verse and sculpture bore an equal part, And Art reflected images to art. Oh when shall Britain, conscious of her claim, Stand emulous of Greek and Roman fame, In living Medals see her wars enroll'd, And vanquish'd realms supply recording gold? Here, rising bold, the Patriot's honest face; There Warriers frowning in historic brass: Then future ages with delight shall see How Plato's, Bacon's, Newton's looks agree; Or in fair series laurell'd bards be shown, A Virgil there, and here an Addison. Then shall thy Craggs (and let me call him mine) On the cast Ore, another Pollio shine; With aspect open, shall erect his head, And round the orb in lasting notes be read, “Statesman, yet friend to Truth! of soul sincere, “In action faithful, and in honour clear; “Who broke no promise, serv'd no private end, “Who gain'd no title, and who lost no friend, “Ennobled by himself, by all approv'd, “And prais'd, unenvy'd, by the Muse he lov'd, EPISTLE IV. TO Mr. Jervas, With Dryden's Translation of Fresnoy's Art of Painting. This Verse be thine, my friend, nor thou refuse This, from no venal or ungrateful Muse. Whether thy hand strike out some free design, Where life awakes, and dawns at ev'ry line; Or blend in beauteous tints the colour'd mass, And from the canvas call the mimic face: Read these instructive leaves, in which conspire Fresnoy's close Art, and Dryden's native fire: And reading wish, like theirs our fate and fame, So mix'd our studies, and so join'd our name? Like them to shine thro' long succeeding age, So just thy skill, so regular my rage. Smit with the love of sister-arts we came, And met congenial, mingling flame with flame; Like friendly colours found them both unite, And each from each contract new strength and light. How oft' in pleasing tasks we wear the day, While summer-suns roll unperceiv'd away? How oft' our slowly-growing works impart, While images reflect from art to art? How oft' review; each finding like a friend Something to blame, and something to commend? What flatt'ring scenes our wondr'ring fancy wrought, Rome's pompous glories rising to our thought! Together o'er the Alps methinks we fly, Fir'd with ideas of fair Italy. With thee, on Raphael's Monument I mourn, Or wait inspiring dreams at Maro's Urn: With thee repose, where Tully once was laid, Or seek some Ruin's formidable shade; While fancy brings the vanish'd piles to view, And builds imaginary Rome a-new. Here thy well study'd marbles fix our eye; A fading Fresco here demands a sigh: Each heav'nly piece unweary'd we compare, Match Raphael's grace with thy lov'd Guido's air, Carracci's strength, Corregio's softer line, Paulo's free stroke, and Titian's warmth divine. How finish'd with illustrious toil appears This small, well-polish'd gem, the Fresnoy employed above twenty years in finishing this Poem. work of years! Yet still how faint by precept is exprest The living image in the painter's breast? Thence endless streams of fair Ideas flow, Strike in the sketch, or in the picture glow; Thence Beauty waking all her forms, supplies An Angel's sweetness, or Bridgwater's eyes. Muse! at that name thy sacred sorrows shed, Those tears eternal, that embalm the dead: Call round her tomb each object of defire, Each purer frame inform'd with purer fire: Bid her be all that chears or softens life, The tender sister, daughter, friend, and wife: Bid her be all that makes mankind adore; Then view this Marble, and be vain no more! Yet still her charms in breathing paint engage; Her modest cheek shall warm a future age. Beauty, frail flow'r that every season sears, Blooms in thy colours for a thousand years. Thus Churchill's race shall other hearts surprize, And other Beauties envy Worsley's eyes; Each pleasing Blount shall endless smiles bestow, And soft Belinda's blush for ever glow. Oh lasting as those colours may they shine, Free as thy stroke, yet faultless as thy line! New graces yearly like thy works display, Soft without weakness, without glaring gay; Led by some rule, that guides, but not constrains; And finish'd more thro' happiness than pains! The kindred Arts shall in their praise conspire, One dip the pencil, and one string the lyre. Yet should the Graces all thy figures place, And breathe an air divine on ev'ry face; Yet should the Muses bid my numbers roll, Strong as their charms, and gentle as their soul; With Zeuxis' Helen thy Bridgwater vie, And these be sung 'till Granville's Myra die: Alas! how little from the grave we claim? Thou but preserv'st a Face, and I a Name. EPISTLE V. TO Miss Blount, With the Works of VOITURE. Written at 17 years old. In these gay thoughts the Loves and graces shine, And all the Writer lives in ev'ry line; His easy art may happy Nature seem, Trifles themselves are elegant in him. Sure to charm all was his peculiar fate, Who without flatt'ry pleas'd the fair and great; Still with esteem no less convers'd than read; With wit well-natur'd, and with books well-bred: His heart, his mistress, and his friend did share His time, the Muse, the witty, and the fair. Thus wisely careless, innocently gay, Chearful he play'd the trifle, life, away. 'Till fate scarce felt his gentle breath supprest, As smiling infants sport themselves to rest. Ev'n rival Wits did Voiture's death deplore, And the gay mourn'd who never mourn'd before; The truest hearts for Voiture heav'd with sighs, Voiture was wept by all the brightest eyes; The Smiles and Loves had dy'd in Voiture's death, But that for ever in his lines they breathe. Let the strict life of graver mortals be A long, exact, and serious Comedy, In every scene some Moral let it teach, And, if it can, at once both please and preach. Let mine, an innocent gay farce appear, And more diverting still than regular, Have humour, wit, a native ease and grace, Tho' not too strictly bound to Time and Place: Critics in wit, or life, are hard to please, Few write to those, and none can live to these. Too much your Sex is by their forms confin'd, Severe to all, but most to womankind; Custom, grown blind with Age, must be your guide; Your pleasure is a vice, but not your pride; By nature yielding, stubborn but for fame; Made Slaves by honour, and made Fools by shame. Marriage may all those petty tyrants chase, But sets up one, a greater in their place; Well might you wish for change, by those accurst, But the last Tyrant ever proves the worst. Still in constraint your suff'ring Sex remains, Or bound in formal, or in real chains: Whole years neglected, for some months ador'd, The fawning servant turns a haughty Lord. Ah quit not the free innocence of life, For the dull glory of a virtuous Wife; Nor let false shews, or empty Titles please: Aim not at joy, but rest content with ease. The Gods, to curse Pamela with her pray'rs, Gave the gilt coach and dappled Flanders Mares, The shining robes, rich jewels, beds of state, And, to compleat her bliss, a Fool for mate. She glares in Balls, front boxes, and the Ring, A vain, unquiet, glitt'ring, wretched Thing! Pride, pomp, and state but reach her outward part, She sighs, and is no Duchess at her heart. But, Madam, if the fates withstand, and you Are destin'd Hymen's willing victim too; Trust not too much your now resistles charms, Those, Age or Sickness, soon or late, disarms; Good humour only teaches charms to last, Still makes new conquests, and maintains the past; Love, rais'd on Beauty, will like that decay, Our Hearts may bear its slender chain a day; As flow'ry bands in wantonness are worn, A morning's pleasure, and at ev'ning torn: This binds in ties more easy, yet more strong, The willing heart, and only holds it long. Thus Madamoiselle Paulet. Voiture's early care still shone the same, And Montausier was only chang'd in name: By this, ev'n now they live, ev'n now they charm, Their Wit still sparkling, and their Flame still warm. Now crown'd with myrtle, on th'Elysian coast, Amid those Lovers, joys his gentle Ghost: Pleas'd, while with smiles his happy lines you view, And finds a fairer Ramboüillet in you. The brightest eyes of France inspir'd his muse; The brightest eyes of Britain now peruse; And dead, as living, 'tis our Author's pride Still to charm those who charm the world beside. EPISTLE VI. To the same on her leaving the Town, after the Coronation. As some fond Virgin, whom her mother's care Draggs from the town to wholesome country air, Just when she learns to roll a melting eye, And hear a spark, yet think no danger nigh; From the dear man unwilling she must sever, Yet takes one kiss before she parts for ever: Thus from the world fair Zephalinda slew, Saw others happy, and with sighs withdrew; Not that their pleasures caus'd her discontent, She sigh'd not that they stay'd, but that she went. She went, to plain-work, and to purling brooks, Old-fashion'd halls, dull aunts, and croaking rooks: She went from Op'ra, park, assembly, play, To morning walks, and pray'r three hours a day: To part her time 'twixt reading and bohea, To muse, and spill her solitary tea, Or o'er cold coffee trifle with the spoon, Count the slow clock, and dine exact at noon: Divert her eyes with pictures in the fire, Hum half a tune, tell stories to the squire; Up to her godly garret after sev'n, There starve and pray, for that's the way to heav'n. Some Squires, perhaps, you take delight to rack; Whose game is whisk, whose treat a toast in sack; Who visits with a Gun, presents you birds, Then gives a smacking buss, and cries,—No words! Or with his hound comes hallowing from the stable, Makes love with nods, and knees beneath a table; Whose laughs are hearty, tho' his jests are coarse, And loves you best of all things—but his horse. In some fair ev'ning, on your elbow laid, You dream of Triumphs in the rural shade; In pensive thought recall the fancy'd scene, See Coronations rise on ev'ry green: Before you pass th'imaginary sights Of lords, and earls, and dukes, and garter'd knights: While the spread fan o'ershades your closing eyes; Then give one flirt, and all the vision flies. Thus vanish scepters, coronets, and balls, And leave you in lone woods, or empty walls! So when your slave, at some, dear idle time, (Not plagu'd with head-achs, or the want of ryme) Stands in the streets, abstracted from the crew, And while he seems to study, thinks of you: Just when his fancy points your sprightly eyes, Or sees the blush of soft Parthenia rise, Gay pats my shoulder, and you vanish quite; Streets, chairs, and coxcombs, rush upon my fight: Vext to be still in town, I knit my brow, Look sour, and hum a song—as you may now. EPISTLE VII. TO Dr. Arbuthnot. This Epistle contains an Apology for the Author and his Writings. It was drawn up at several times, as the several occasions offered. He had no thought of publishing it, till it pleas'd some persons of Rank and Fortune to attack, in a very extraordinary manner, not only his Writings, but his Morals, Person, and Family: of which he therefore thought himself obliged to give some account. Shut, shut the door, good John! fatigu'd I said, Tye up the knocker, say I'm sick, I'm dead. The Dog-star rages! nay 'tis past a doubt, All Bedlam, or Parnassus, is let out: Fire in each eye, and papers in each hand, They rave, recite, and madden round the land. What walls can guard me, or what shades can hide? They pierce my thickets, thro' my Grot they glide, By land, by water, they renew the charge, They stop the chariot, and they board the barge. No place is sacred, not the Church is free, Ev'n Sunday shines no Sabbath-day to me: Then from the Mint walks forth the man of rhyme, Happy! to catch me, just at dinner-time. Is there a parson, much be-mus'd in beer, A maudling poetess, a ryming peer, A clerk, foredoom'd his father's soul to cross, Who pens a stanza when he should engross? Is there, who lock'd from ink and paper, scrawls With desp'rate charcoal round his darken'd walls? All fly to Twit'nam and in humble strain Apply to me, to keep them mad, or vain. Arthur, whose giddy son neglects the laws, Imputes to me and my damn'd works the cause: Poor Cornus sees his frantic wife elope, And curses wit, and poetry, and Pope. Friend to my Life! (which did not you prolong, The world had wanted many an idle song) What Drop or Nostrum can this plague remove? Or which must end me, a fool's wrath or love? A dire dilemma! either way I'm sped, If foes, they write, if friends, they read me dead. Seiz'd and ty'd down to judge, how wretched I, Who can't be silent, and who will not lye; To laugh, were want of goodness-and-of-grace, And to be grave, exceeds all pow'r of face. I sit with sad civility, I read With honest anguish, and an aching head; And drop at last, but in unwilling ears, This saving council, “Keep your piece nine years.” Nine years! cries he, who high in Drury-lane Lull'd by soft Zephyrs thro' the broken pane, Rymes 'ere he wakes, and prints before Term ends, Oblig'd by hunger, and request of friends: “The piece you think is incorrect? why take it, “I'm all submission, what you'd have it, make it.” Three things another's modest wishes bound, My friendship, and a Prologue, and ten pound. The name taken from a foolish Poet of Rhodes, who pretended much to Greek. Schol. in Horat. lib. 1. Pitholeon sends to me: “You know his Grace, “I want a patron; ask him for a place.” Pitholeon libell'd me—“but here's a letter “Informs you, sir, 'twas when he knew no better. “Dare you refuse him? Curl invites to dine! “He'll write a Journal, or he'll turn Divine.” Bless me! a packet.—“'Tis a stranger sues, “A Virgin Tragedy, an Orphan Muse.” If I dislike it, “Furies, death and rage! If I approve, “commend it to the Stage.” There (thank my stars) my whole commission ends, The Players and I are, luckily, no friends. Fir'd that the house reject him, “'Sdeath I'll print it “And shame the fools—your int'rest, sir, with Lintot.” Lintot, dull rogue! will think your price too much. “Not sir, if you revise it, and retouch.” All my demurs but double his attacks, At last he whispers, “do, and we go snacks. Glad of a quarrel, strait I clap the door, Sir, let me see your works and you no more. 'Tis sung, when Midas' Ears began to spring, (Midas, a sacred person and a King) His very Minister who spy'd them first, (Some say his The story is told by some of his Barber, but by Chaucer of his Queen. See Wife of Bath's Tale in Dryden's Fables. Queens) was forc'd to speak, or burst. And is not mine, my friend, a sorer case, When ev'ry coxcomb perks them in my face, “Good friend forbear! you deal in dang'rous things, “I'd never name Queens, ministers or kings; “Keep close to ears, and those let asses prick, “'Tis nothing”—Nothing if they bite and kick? Out with it, Dunciad! let the secret pass, That secret to each fool, that he's an ass: The truth once told, (and wherefore should we lie?) The Queen of Midas slept, and so may I. You think this cruel? take it for a rule, No creature smarts so little as a fool. Let peals of laughter, Codrus! round thee break, Thou unconcern'd canst hear the mighty crak: Pit, box, and gall'ry in convulsions hurl'd, V. 88.—Alluding to Horace, —Si fractus illabatur Orbis Impavidum ferient ruinæ.Thou stand'st unshook amidst a bursting world. Who shames a Scribler? break one cobweb thro', He spins the slight, self-pleasing thread anew: Destroy his fib, or sophistry, in vain, The creature's at his dirty work again; Thron'd in the centre of his thin designs, Proud of a vast extent of flimzy lines! Whom have I hurt? has Poet yet, or Peer, Lost the arch'd eye-brow, or Parnassian sneer? And has not Colly still his lord, and whore? His butchers Henley, his free-masons Moore? Does not one table Arnall still admit? Still to one Bishop Phillips seem a wit? Still Sappho—“Hold! for God-sake—you'll offend, “No names—be calm—learn prudence of a friend: “I too could write, and I am twice as tall, “But foes like these!—One Flatt'rers worse than all; Of all mad creatures, if the learn'd are right, It is the slaver kills, and not the bite. A fool quite angry is quite innocent; Alas! 'tis ten times worse when they repent. One dedicates in high heroic prose, And ridicules beyond a hundred foes; One from all Grub-street will my fame defend, And, more abusive, calls himself my friend. This prints my Letters, or expects a bribe, And others roar aloud, “Subscribe, subscribe.” There are, who to my person pay their court, I cough like Horace, and tho' lean, am short, Ammon's great son one shoulder had too high, Such Ovid's nose, and Sir! you have an Eye— Go on, obliging creatures, make me see All that disgrac'd my betters, met in me. Say for my comfort, languishing in bed, “Just so immortal Maro held his head: And when I die, be sure you let me know, Great Homer dy'd three thousand years ago. Why did I write? what sin to me unknown Dipt me in Ink, my parents, or my own? As yet a child, nor yet a fool to fame, I lisp'd in numbers, for the numbers came. I left no calling for this idle trade. No duty broke, no father disobey'd. The Muse but serv'd to ease some friend, not Wife, To help me thro' this long disease, my life, To second, Arbuthnot! thy Art and care, And teach, the Being you preserv'd, to bear. But why then publish? Granville the polite, And knowing Walsh, would tell me I could write, Well-natur'd Garth inflam'd with early praise, And Congreve lov'd, and Swift endur'd my lays; The courtly Talbot, All these were Patrons or Admirers of Mr. Dryden, tho' a scandalous libel against him, entituled, Dryden's Satyr to his Muse, has been printed in the name of the Lord Somers, of which he was wholly ignorant. These are the persons to whose account the Author charges the publication of his first pieces: persons with whom he was conversant (and he adds belov'd) at 16 or 17 years of age; an early period for such acquaintance. The catalogue might be made yet more illustrious, had he not confined it to that time when he writ the Pastorals and Windsor Forest, on which he passes a sort of censure in the lines following, While pure Description held the place of Sense, &amp;c Somers, Sheffield read, Ev'n mitred Rochester would nod the head, And St. John's self (great Dryden's friend before) With open arms receiv'd one Poet more. Happy my studies, when by these approv'd! Happier their author, when by these belov'd! From these the world will judge of men and books, Not from the Authors of secret and scandalous History. Burnets, Oldmixons, and Cooks. Soft were my numbers, who could take offence While pure Description held the place of sense; Like gentle Fanny's was my flow'ry theme, A painted mistress, or a purling stream. Yet then did Gildon draw his venal quill; I wish'd the man a dinner, and fate still: Yet then did Dennis rave in furious fret; I never answer'd, I was not in debt: If want provok'd, or madness made them print, I wag'd no war with Bedlam or the Mint. Did some more sober Critics come abroad? If wrong, I smil'd; if right, I kiss'd the rod. Pains, reading, study, are their just pretence, And all they want is spirit, taste, and sense. Comma's and points they set exactly right. And 'twere a sin to rob them of their mite. Yet ne'er one sprig of laurel grac'd these ribalds, From slashing Bentley down to pidling Tibalds. Each wight who reads not, only scans and spells, Each word-catcher who lives on syllables, Ev'n such small critics some regard may claim, Preserv'd in Milton's or in Shakespear's name. Pretty! in amber to observe the forms Of hairs, or straws, or dirt, or grubs, or worms! The things, we know, are neither rich nor rare, But wonder how the devil they got there? Were others angry? I excus'd them too; Well might they rage, I gave them but their due. A man's true merit 'tis not hard to find, But each man's secret standard in his mind, That casting-weight pride adds to emptiness, This, who can gratify? For who can guess? The Bard whom pilf'red Pastorels renown, Who turns a Persian tale for half a crown, Just writes to make his barrenness appear, And strains, from hard-bound brains, eight lines a year: He, who still wanting, tho' he lives on theft, Steals much, spends little, yet has nothing left: And he, who now to sense, now nonsense leaning, Means not, but blunders round about a meaning: And he, whose sustian's so sublimely bad, It is not poetry, but prose run mad: All these, my modest satire bad translate, And own'd, that nine such poets made a Tate. How did they fume, and stamp, and roar, and chafe? And swear, not Addison himself was safe. Peace to all such! but were there one whose fires True Genius kindles, and fair Fame inspires, Blest with each talent, and each art to please, And born to write, converse, and live with ease: Shou'd such a man, too fond to rule alone, Bear, like the Turk, no brother near the throne, View him with scornful, yet with jealous eyes, And hate for arts that caus'd himself to rise; Damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer, And without sneering, teach the rest to sneer; Willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike, Just hint a fault, and hesitate dislike; Alike reserv'd to blame, or to commend, A tim'rous foe, and a suspicious friend; Dreading ev'n fools, by Flatterers besieg'd, And so obliging that he ne'er oblig'd; Like Cato, give his little Senate laws, And sit attentive to his own applause; While Wits and Templers ev'ry sentence raise, And wonder with a foolish face of praise: Who but must laugh if such a man there be? Who would not weep, if Atticus were he? What tho' my Name stood rubric on the walls? Or plaster'd posts, with claps in capitals? Or smoaking forth, a hundred hawkers load, On wings of winds came flying all abroad, I sought no homage from the race that write; I kept, like Asian monarchs, from their sight; Poems I heeded (now be rym'd so long) No more than thou, great George! a birth-day song. I ne'er with wits nor witlings past my days, To spread about the itch of verse and praise; Nor like a puppy, daggled through the town, To fetch and carry sing-song up and down; Nor at Rehearsals sweat, and mouth'd, and cry'd, With handkerchief and orange at my side; But sick of fops, and poetry, and prate, To Bufo left the whole Castalian state. Proud, as Apollo on his forked hill, Sate full blown Bufo puff'd by ev'ry quill; Fed with soft Dedication all day long, Horace and he went hand in hand in song. His Library, (where busts of poets dead V. 236.—a true Pindar stood without a head.] ridicules the affectation of Antiquaries, who frequently exhibit the headless Trunks and Terms of Statues, for Plato, Homer, Pindar, &amp;c. Vide Fulv. Ursin, &amp;c.And a true Pindar stood without a head) Receiv'd of wits an undistinguish'd race, Who first his judgment ask'd, and then a place: Much they extoll'd his pictures, much his seat, And flatter'd ev'ry day, and some days eat: Till grown more frugal in his riper days, He pay'd some bards with port, and some with praise, To some a dry rehearsal was assign'd, And others (harder still) he paid in kind. Dryden alone (what wonder?) came not nigh, Dryden alone escap'd this judging eye. But still the great have kindness in reserve, V. 248.—help'd to bury.] Mr. Dryden, after having liv'd in exigencies, had a magnificent Funeral bestow'd upon him by the contribution of several Persons of Quality.He help'd to bury him he help'd to starve. May some choice Patron bless each gray goose quill! May ev'ry Bavius have his Bufo still! So, when a Statesman wants a day's defence, Or Envy holds a whole week's war with sense, Or simple pride for flatt'ry makes demands, May dunce by dunce be whistled off my hands! Blest be the Great, for those they take away, And those they left me—For they left me Gay; Left me to see neglected genius bloom, Neglected die, and tell it on his tomb: Of all thy blameless life the sole return, My Verse, and Queensb'ry weeping o'er thy urn! Oh, let me live my own, and die so too! (“To live and die is all I have to do) Maintain a Poet's dignity and ease, And see what friends, and read what books I please: Above a Patron, tho' I condescend Sometimes to call a Minister my friend. I was not born for courts or great affairs: I pay my debts, believe, and say my pray'rs; Can sleep without a poem in my head, Nor know, if Dennis be alive or dead. Why am I ask'd, what next shall see the light? Heav'ns! was I born for nothing but to write? Has life no joys for me? or, to be grave, Have I no friend to serve, no soul to save? “I found him close with Swift—Indeed? no doubt “(Cries prating Balbus) something will come out. 'Tis all in vain, deny it as I will. “No, such a Genius never can lie still.” And then for mine obligingly mistakes The first lampoon Sir Will. or Bubo makes, Poor guiltless I! and can I chuse but smile, When ev'ry coxcomb knows me by my Style? Curst be the verse, how well soe'er it flow, That tends to make one worthy man my foe, Give Virtue scandal, Innocence a fear, Or from the soft-ey'd virgin steal a tear! But he who hurts a harmless neighbour's peace, Insults fall'n worth, or beauty in distress, Who loves a lye, lame slander helps about, Who writes a libel, or who copies out: That fop, whose pride affects a patron's name, Yet absent, wounds an author's honest fame; Who can your merit selfishly approve, And show the sense of it without the love; Who has the vanity to call you friend, Yet wants the honour injur'd to defend: Who tells whate'er you think, whate'er you say, And, if he lye not, must at least betray: V. 299. See the Epistle to the Earl of Burlington.Who to the Dean and silver bell can swear, And sees at Cannon's what was never there; Who reads, but with a lust to misapply, Make Satire a lampoon, and Fiction lye. A lash like mine no honest man shall dread, But all such babling blockheads in his stead. Let Sporus tremble—“What? that thing of silk, “Sporus, that mere white curd of Ass's milk? “Satire or sense alas! can Sporus feel? “Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?” Yet let me flap this bug with gilded wings, This painted child of dirt, that stinks and stings, Whose buzz the witty and the fair annoys, Yet wit ne'er tastes, and beauty ne'er enjoys: So well-bred spaniels civilly delight In mumbling of the game they dare not bite. Eternal smiles his emptiness betray, As shallow streams run dimpling all the way. Whether in florid impotence he speaks, And, as the prompter breathes, the puppet squeaks; V. 319. See Milton. Book 4.Or at the ear of Eve, familiar toad, Half froth, half venom, spits himself abroad, In puns, or politicks, or tales, or lyes, Or spite, or smut, or rymes, or blasphemies. His wit all see-saw between that and this, Now high, now low, now master up, now miss, And he himself one vile Antithesis. Amphibious thing! that acting either part, The trifling head, or the corrupted heart, Fop at the toilet, flat'trer at the board, Now trips a Lady, and now struts a Lord. Eve's tempter thus the Rabbins have exprest, A Cherub's face, a reptile all the rest, Beauty that shocks you, parts that none can trust, Wit that can creep, and Pride that licks the dust. Not Fortune's worshipper, nor Fashion's fool, Nor Lucre's madman, nor Ambition's tool, Not proud, nor servile; be one Poet's praise, That, if he pleas'd, he pleas'd by manly ways; That Flatt'ry, ev'n to Kings, he held a shame, And thought a Lye in verse or prose the same: That not in Fancy's maze he wander'd long, But stoop'd to Truth, and moraliz'd his song: That not for Fame, but Virtue's better end, He stood the furious foe, the timid friend, The damning critic, half approving wit, The coxcomb hit, or fearing to be hit; Laugh'd at the loss of friends he never had, The dull, the proud, the wicked, or the mad; The distant threats of vengeance on his head, The blow unfelt, the tear he never shed?

Th'imputed trash.] Such as profane Psalms, Court-Poems, and other scandalous things, printed in his Name by Curl and others.Th'imputed trash, and dulness not his own, The morals blacken'd when the writings scape, The libel'd person, and the pictur'd shape; Ver. 354. Abuse, on all he lov'd, or lov'd him.] Namely on the Duke of Buckingham, the Earl of Burlington, Ld. Bathurst, Ld. Bolingbroke, Bishop Atterbury, Dr. Swift, Dr. Arbuthnot, Mr. Gay, his Friends, his Parents, and his very Nurse, aspersed in printed papers, by James Moore, G. Ducket, L. Welsted, Tho.

Yet soft by nature, more a dupe than wit, Sapho can tell you how this man was bit: This dreaded Sat'rist Dennis will confess Foe to his pride, but friend to his distress: So humble, he has knock'd at Tibbald's door, Has drunk with Cibber, nay has rhym'd for Moor: Ver. 374. Ten Years.] It was so long before the Author of the Dunciad published that poem, till when, he never writ a word in answer to the many scurrilities and Falshoods concerning him.Full ten years slander'd, did he once reply? Ver. 375. Welsted's Lye.] This Man had the impudence to tell in print, that Mr. P. had occasion'd a Lady's death, and to name a person he never heard of. He also publish'd that he libel'd the Duke of Chandos; with whom (it was added) that he had liv'd in familiarity, and receiv'd from him a present of five hundred Pounds: the falsehood of both which is known to his Grace. Mr. P. never receiv'd any present, farther than the Subscrption for Homer, from him, or from Any Great Man whatsoever. Budgel in a weekly pamphlet call'd the Bee, bestow'd much abuse on him, in the imagination that he writ some things about the Last Will of Dr. Tindal, in the Grubstreet Journal; a paper wherein he never had the least hand, direction, or supervisal, nor the least knowledge of its Authors.Three thousand suns went down on Welsted's lye: To please a mistress one aspers'd his life, He lash'd him not, but let her be his wife: Let Budgel charge low Grubstreet on his quill, Ann write whate'er he pleas'd except his will; Let the two Curls of Town and Court, abuse Ver. 381. His Father, Mother, &amp;c.] In some of Curl's and other pamphlets, Mr. Pope's Father was said to be a mechanic, a hatter, a farmer, nay a bankrupt. But what is stranger, a Nobleman (if such a Reflection could be thought to come from a Nobleman) had dropt an allusion to that pitiful untruth, in a paper called an Epistle to a Doctor of Divinity: and the following line, Hard as thy Heart, and as thy Birth obscure, had fallen from a like Courtly pen, in certain Verses to the Imitator of Horace. Mr. Pope's Father was of a Gentleman's family in of Oxfordshire, the head of which was the Earl of Downe, whose sole Heiress married the Earl of Lindsey.—His mother was the daughter of William Turnor Esq; of York: She had three Brothers, one of whom was kill'd, another died in the service of King Charles; the eldest following his fortunes, and becoming a general Officer in Spain, left her what estate remain'd after the sequestrations and forfeitures of her Family.—Mr. Pope died in 1717, aged 75; She in 1733, aged 93, a very few weeks after this poem was finished. The following Inscription was placed by their son on their Monument in the parish of Twickenham, in Middlesex. D. O. M./ Alexandro Pope, Viro Innocuo, Probo, Pio,/ Qui vixit annos LXXV, ob. MDCCXVII./ Et Edithae Conjugi Inculpabili,/ Pientissimae, Quae vixit annos/ XCIII, ob. MDCCXXXIII./ Parentibus Benemerentibus Filius Fecit,/ Et Sibi./His father, mother, body, soul, and muse. Yet why? that Father held it for a rule It was a sin to call our neighbour fool, That harmless Mother thought no wife a whore; Hear this, and spare his family, James More! Unspotted names, and memorable long, If there be force in Virtue, or in Song. Of gentle blood (part shed in Honour's cause, While yet in Britain Honour had applause) Each parent sprang—“What fortune, pray?—their own, And better got than Bestia's from the Throne. Born to no Pride, inheriting no Strife, Nor marrying discord in a noble wife, Stranger to civil and religious rage, The good man walk'd inoxious thro' his age: No Courts he saw, no suits would ever try, Nor dar'd an Oath, nor hazarded a lye: Un-learn'd, he knew no schoolman's subtile art, No language, but the language of the heart: By nature honest, by experience wise, Healthy by temp'rance, and by exercise, His life, tho' long, to sickness past unknown, His death was instant, and without a groan. O grant me thus to live, and thus to die! Who sprung from Kings shall know less joy than I. O Friend! may each domestic bliss be thine! Be no unpleasing Melancholy mine: Me, let the tender office long engage To rock the cradle of reposing Age, With lenient arts extend a Mother's breath, Make languor smile, and smooth the bed of death, Explore the thought, explain the asking eye, And keep a while one parent from the sky! On cares like these if length of days attend, May heav'n, to bless those days, preserve my friend, Preserve him social, chearful, and serene, And just as rich as when he serv'd a Queen. Whether that blessing be deny'd or giv'n, Thus far was right, the rest belongs to Heav'n. SATIRES OF HORACE IMITATED, With Satires of Dr. DONNE, VERSIFY'D ADVERTISEMENT. The Occasion of publishing these Imitations was the Clamour raised on some of my Epistles. An Answer from Horace was both more full, and of more Dignity, than any I could have made in my own person; and the Example of so much greater Freedom in so eminent a Divine as Dr. Donne, seem'd a proof with what indignation and contempt a Christian may treat Vice or Folly, in ever so low, or ever so high, a Station. Both these Authors were acceptable to the Princes and Ministers under whom they lived. The Satires of Dr. Donne I versifyed at the desire of the Earl of Oxford while he was Lord Treasurer, and of the Duke of Shrewsbury who had been Secretary of State; neither of them look'd upon a Satire on Vicious Courts as any Reflection on those they serv'd in. And indeed there is not in the world a greater error, than that which Fools are so apt to fall into, and Knaves with good reason to incourage, the mistaking a Satyrist for a Libeller; whereas to a true Satyrist nothing is so odious as a Libeller, for the same reason as to a man truly virtuous nothing is so hateful as a Hypocrite. SATIRE I. P. There are (I scarce can think it, but am told) There are to whom my Satire seems too bold: Scarce to wise Peter complaisant enough, And something said of Chartres much too rough. The lines are weak, another's pleas'd to say, Lord Fanny spins a thousand such a day. Tim'rous by nature, of the Rich in awe, I come to Council learned in the Law. You'll give me, like a friend both sage and free, Advice; and (as you use) without a Fee. F. I'd write no more. P. Not write? but then I think, And for my soul I cannot sleep a wink. I nod in company, I wake at night, Fools rush into my head, and so I write. F. You could not do a worse thing for your life. Why, if the nights seem tedious—take a wife: Or rather truly, if your point be rest, Lettuce and cowslip wine: Probatum est. But talk with Celsus, Celsus will advise Hartshorn, or something that shall close your eyes. Or, if you needs must write, write Caesar's praise: You'll gain at least a Knighthood, or the Bays. P. What? like Sir Richard, rumbling, rough, and fierce, With Arms, and George, and Brunswick, crowd the verse, Rend with tremendous sound your ears asunder, With Gun, drum, trumpet, blunderbuss, and thunder? Or nobly wild, with Budgell's fire and force, Paint Angels trembling round his falling Horse? F. Then all your Muse's softer art display, Let Carolina smooth the tuneful lay, Lull with Amelia's liquid name the nine, And sweetly flow through all the Royal Line. P. Alas! few verses touch their nicer ear; They scarce can bear their Laureate twice a year: And justly Caesar scorns the Poet's lays, It is to History he trusts for Praise. F. Better be Cibber, I'll maintain it still, Than ridicule all Taste, blaspheme Quadrille, Abuse the City's best good men in metre, And laugh at Peers that put their trust in Peter. Ev'n those you touch not, hate you. P. What should ail 'em? F. A hundred smart in Timon and in Balaam: The fewer still you name, you wound the more; Bond is but one, but Harpax is a score. P. Each mortal has his pleasure: none deny Sc?le his bottle, D?ty his Ham-pye; Ridotta sips and dances, till she see The doubling Lustres dance as fast as she; F? loves the Senate, Hockley-hole his brother, Like in all else, as one egg to another. I love to pour out all my self, as plain As downright Shippen, or as old Montagne. In them, as certain to be lov'd as seen, The Soul stood forth, not kept a thought within; In me, what spots (for spots I have) appear, Will prove at least the Medium must be clear. In this impartial glass, my Muse intends Fair to expose my self, my foes, my friends; Publish the present age; but where my text Is vice too high, reserve it for the next: My foes shall wish my life a longer date, And ev'ry friend the less lament my fate. My head and heart thus flowing thro' my quill, Verse-man or Prose-man, term me which you will, Papist or Protestant, or both between, Like good Erasmus in an honest mean, In moderation placing all my glory, While Tories call me Whig, and Whigs a Tory. Satire's my weapon, but I'm too discreet To run a muck, and tilt at all I meet; I only wear it in a land of Hectors, Thieves, Supercargoes, Sharpers, and Directors, Save but our Army! and let Jove incrust Swords, pikes, and guns, with everlasting rust! Peace is my dear delight—not Fleury's more: But touch me, and no Minister so sore. Whoe'er offends, at some unlucky time Slides into verse, and hitches in a rhyme, Sacred to ridicule his whole life long, And the sad burthen of some merry song. Slander or poyson dread from Delia's rage, Hard words or hanging, if your Judge be From furious Sappho scarce a milder fate, P-x'd by her love, or libell'd by her hate. Its proper pow'r to hurt, each creature feels, Bulls aim their horns, and asses lift their heels, 'Tis a bear's talent not to kick but hug, And no man wonders he's not stung by Pug: So drink with Waters, or with Chartres eat, They'll never poyson you, they'll only cheat. Then, learned Sir! (to cut the matter short) Whate'er my fate, or well or ill at Court, Whether old age with faint, but chearful ray, Attends to gild the Evening of my day, Or death's black wing already be display'd To wrap me in the universal shade; Whether the darken'd room to muse invite, Or whiten'd wall provoke the skew'r to write; In durance, exile, Bedlam, or the Mint, Like Lee or Budgell, I will rhyme, and print. F. Alas young man! your days can ne'er be long, In flow'r of age you perish for a song! Plums and Directors, Shylock and his Wife, Will club their testers, now, to take your life! P. What? arm'd for Virtue when I point the pen, Brand the bold front of shameless, guilty men, Dash the proud Gamester in his gilded car, Bare the mean heart that lurks beneath a Star; Can there be wanting, to defend Her cause, Lights of the Church, or Guardians of the Laws? Could pension'd Boileau lash in honest strain Flatt'rers and bigots ev'n in Louis' reign? Could Laureate Dryden Pimp and Fry'r engage, Yet neither Charles nor James be in a rage? And I not strip the gilding off a Knave, Unplac'd, unpension'd, no man's heir, or slave? I will, or perish in the gen'rous cause: Hear this and tremble! you who 'scape the laws. Yes, while I live, no rich or noble knave Shall walk in peace, and credit, to his grave. To Virtue only and her friends a friend, The World beside may murmur, or commend. Know, all the distant din that world can keep Rolls o'er my Grotto, and but sooths my sleep. There, my retreat the best companions grace, Chiefs out of war, and Statesmen out of place. There St. John mingles with my friendly bowl, The Feast of Reason and the Flow of soul: And Charles Mordaunt Earl of Peterborough, who in the year 1705 took Barcelona, and in the winter following with only 280 horse and 900 foot enterprized and accomplish'd the Conquest of Valentia. He, whose lightning pierc'd th'Iberian lines, Now forms my Quincunx, and now ranks my Vines, Or tames the Genius of the stubborn plain, Almost as quickly, as he conquer'd Spain. Envy must own, I live among the Great, No Pimp of pleasure, and no Spy of state, With eyes that pry not, tongue that ne'er repeats, Fond to spread friendships, but to cover heats, To help who want, to forward who excel; This, all who know me, know; who love me, tell; And who unknown defame me, let them be Scriblers or Peers, alike are Mob to me. This is my plea, on this I rest my cause— What saith my Council learned in the laws? F. Your Plea is good; but still, I say, beware! Laws are explain'd by Men—so have a care. It stands on record, that in Richard's times A man was hang'd for very honest rhymes. Consult the Statute: quart. I think it is, Edwardi sext. or prim. &amp; quint. Eliz. See Libels, Satires—here you have it—read. P. Libels and Satires! lawless things indeed! But grave Epistles, bringing vice to light, Such as a King might read, a Bishop write, Such as Sir Robert would approve— F. Indeed? The Case is alter'd—you may then proceed; In such a cause the Plaintiff will be hiss'd, My Lords the Judges laugh, and you're dismiss'd. SATIRE II. What, and how great, the Virtue and the Art To live on little with a chearful heart, (A doctrine sage, but truly none of mine) Let's talk, my friends, but talk before we dine: Not when a gilt Buffet's reflected pride Turns you from sound Philosophy aside: Not when from plate to plate your eyeballs roll, And the brain dances to the mantling bowl. Hear Bethel's Sermon, one not vers'd in schools, But strong in sense, and wise without the rules. Go work, hunt, exercise! (he thus began) Then scorn a homely dinner if you can. Your wine lock'd up, your Butler stroll'd abroad, Or kept from fish, (the river yet unthaw'd) If then plain bread and milk will do the feat, The pleasure lies in you, and not the meat. Preach as I please, I doubt our curious men Will chuse a pheasant still before a hen; Yet hens of Guinea full as good I hold, Except you eat the feathers green and gold. Of Carps and Mullets why prefer the great, (Tho' cut in pieces 'ere my Lord can eat) Yet for small Turbots such esteem profess? Because God made these large, the other less. Oldfield, with more than Harpy throat endu'd, Cries, “Send me, Gods! a whole Hog A West Indian term of gluttony, a hog roasted whole, stuff'd with spice, and basted with Madera wine. barbecu'd! Oh blast it, south-winds! till a stench exhale Rank as the ripeness of a rabbit's tail. By what Criterion do ye eat, d'ye think, If this is priz'd for sweetness, that for stink? When the tir'd glutton labours thro' a treat, He'll find no relish in the sweetest meat, He calls for something bitter, something sour, And the rich feast concludes extremely poor: Cheap eggs, and herbs, and olives, still we see, Thus much is left of old Simplicity! The Robin-red-breast till of late had rest, And children sacred held a Martin's nest, Till Becca-ficos sold so dev'lish dear, To one that was, and would have been, a Peer. Let me extoll a Cat, on oysters fed, I'll have a party at the Bedford-Head, Or ev'n to crack live crawfish recommend, I'd never doubt at Court to make a friend. 'Tis yet in vain, I own, to keep a pother About one vice, and fall into the other: Between excess and famine lies a mean, Plain, but not sordid; tho' not splendid, clean. Avidien, or his Wife (no matter which, For him you'll call a dog, and her a bitch) Sell their presented partridges, and fruits, And humbly live on rabbits and on roots: One half-point bottle serves them both to dine, And is at once their vinegar and wine. But on some lucky day (as when they found A lost bank-bill, or heard their Son was drown'd) At such a feast, old vinegar to spare, Is what two souls so gen'rous cannot bear; Oyl, tho' it stink, they drop by drop impart, But sowse the cabbage with a bounteous heart. He knows to live, who keeps the middle state, And neither leans on this side, nor on that: Nor stops, for one bad cork, his butler's pay, Swears, like Albutius, a good Cook away; Nor lets, like Nævius, ev'ry error pass, The musty wine, foul cloth, or greasy glass. Now hear what blessings Temperance can bring: (Thus said our friend, and what he said I sing) First Health: The stomach (cramm'd from ev'ry dish, A tomb of boil'd, and roast, and flesh, and fish, Where bile, and wind, and phlegm, and acid jar, And all the man is one intestine war) Remembers oft the school-boys simple fare, The temp'rate sleeps, and spirits light as air. How pale, each worshipful and rev'rend guest Rise from a clergy, or a city feast! What life in all that ample body, say, What heav'nly particle inspires the clay? The soul subsides, and wickedly inclines To seem but mortal, ev'n in sound divines. On morning wings how active springs the mind That leaves the load of yesterday behind? How easy ev'ry labour it pursues? How coming to the Poet ev'ry Muse? Not but we may exceed, some holy time, Or tir'd in search of Truth, or search of rhyme; Ill health some just indulgence may engage, And more, the sickness of long life, old age; For fainting age what cordial drop remains, If our intemp'rate youth the vessel drains? Our fathers prais'd rank Ven'son. You suppose Perhaps, young men! our fathers had no nose? Not so: a Buck was then a week's repast, And 'twas their point, I ween, to make it last: More pleas'd to keep it till their friends could come, Than eat the sweetest by themselves at home. Why had not I in those good times my birth, Ere coxcomb pyes or coxcombs were on earth? Unworthy he, the voice of Fame to hear, That sweetest musick to an honest ear; For faith Lord Fanny! you are in the wrong, The world's good word is better than a song) Who has not learn'd, fresh sturgeon and ham-pye Are no rewards for want, and infamy! When luxury has lick'd up all thy pelf, Curs'd by thy neighbours, thy trustees, thyself, To friends, to fortune, to mankind a shame, Think how posterity will treat thy name; And buy a rope, that future times may tell Thou hast at least bestow'd one penny well. “Right, cries his Lordship, for a rogue in need “To have a Taste, is insolence indeed: “In me 'tis noble, suits my birth and state, “My wealth unwieldy, and my heap too great. Then, like the Sun, let Bounty spread her ray, And shine that superfluity away. Oh impudence of wealth! with all thy store, How dar'st thou let one worthy man be poor? Shall half the new-built churches round thee fall? Make Keys, build Bridges, or repair White-hall: Or to thy country let that heap be lent, As M??o's was, but not a five per cent. Who thinks that Fortune cannot change her mind, Prepares a dreadful jest for all mankind! And who stands safest, tell me? is it he That spreads and swells in puff'd prosperity, Or blest with little, whose preventing care In peace provides fit arms against a war? Thus Bethel spoke, who always speaks his thought, And always thinks the very thing he ought. His equal mind I copy what I can, And as I love, would imitate the man. In South-sea days not happier, when surmis'd The Lord of thousands, than if now Excis'd; In forests planted by a Father's hand, Than in five acres now of rented land. Content with little, I can piddle here On brocoli and mutton, round the year; But ancient friends (tho' poor, or out of play) That touch my bell, I cannot turn away. 'Tis true, no Turbots dignify my boards, But gudgeons, flounders, what my Thames affords: To Hounslow-heath I point, and Bansted-down, Thence comes your mutton, and these chicks my own: From yon old walnut-tree, a show'r shall fall? And grapes, long-lingring on my only wall, And figs, from standard and espalier join: The dev'l is in you if you cannot dine. Then chearful healths (your Mistress shall have place) And, what's more rare, a Poet shall say Grace. Fortune not much of humbling me can boast; Tho' double tax'd, how little have I lost? My life's amusements have been just the same, Before, and after Standing Armies came. My lands are sold, my father's house is gone; I'll hire another's: is not that my own? And yours, my friends? thro' whose free-opening gate None comes too early, none departs too late; (For I, who hold sage Homer's rule the best, Welcome the coming, speed the going guest.) “Pray heav'n it last! (cries Swift) as you go on; “I wish to God this house had been your own. “Pity! to build, without a son or wife: “Why, you'll enjoy it only all your life.”— Well, if the use be mine, can it concern one Whether the name belong to Pope or Vernon? What's Property? dear Swift! you see it alter From you to me, from me to Peter Walter, Or, in a mortgage, prove the Lawyer's share, Or, in a jointure, vanish from the heir, Or in pure equity (the case not clear) The Chanc'ry takes your rents for twenty year: At best, it falls to some ungracious son, Who cries, my father's damn'd, and all's my own. Shades, that to Ba??n could retreat afford, Are now the portion of a booby lord; And Hemsley, once proud Villers Duke of Buckingham, Buckingham's delight, Slides to a Scriv'ner or a city Knight. Let lands and houses have what lords they will, Let Us be fix'd, and our own masters still. SATIRES OF Dr. JOHN DONNE, Dean of St. Paul's. Quid vetat, ut nosmet Lucili scripta legentes Quærere, num illius, num rerum dura negarit Versiculos natura magis factos, &amp; euntes Mollius? Hor. THE SECOND SATIRE OF Dr. JOHN DONNE. Yes; thank my stars! as early as I knew This Town, I had the sense to hate it too: Yet here, as ev'n in Hell, there must be still One Giant-Vice, so excellently ill, That all beside one pities, not abhors; As who knows Sapho, smiles at other whores. I grant that Poetry's a crying sin; It brought (no doubt) th'Excise and Army in: Catch'd like the Plague, or Love, the lord knows how, But that the cure is starving, all allow. Yet like the Papists, is the Poets state, Poor and disarm'd, and hardly worth your hate. Here a lean Bard whose wit could never give Himself a dinner, makes an Actor live: The Thief condemn'd, in law already dead, So prompts, and saves a rogue who cannot read. Thus as the pipes of some carv'd Organ move, The gilded puppets dance and mount above, Heav'd by the breath th'inspiring bellows blow: Th'inspiring bellows lie and pant below. One sings the Fair; but songs no longer move, No rat is rhym'd to death, nor maid to love: In love's, in nature's spite, the siege they hold, And scorn the flesh, the dev'l, and all but gold. These write to Lords, some mean reward to get, As needy beggars sing at doors for meat. Those write because all write, and so have still Excuse for writing and for writing ill. Wretched indeed but far more wretched yet Is he who makes his meal on others wit: 'Tis chang'd indeed from what it was before, His rank digestion makes it wit no more: Sense, past thro' him, no longer is the same, For food digested takes another name. I pass o'er all those Confessors and Martyrs Who live like S?tt?n, or who die like Chartres, Out-cant old Esdras, or out-drink his heir, Out-usure Jews, or Irishmen out-swear; Wicked as pages, who in early years Act sins which Prisca's Confessor scarce hears: Ev'n those I pardon, for whose sinful sake Schoolmen new tenements in hell must make; Of whose strange crimes no Canonist can tell In what Commandment's large contents they dwell. One, one man only breeds my just offence; Whom crimes gave wealth, and wealth gave Impudence: Time, that at last, matures a clap to pox, Whose gentle progress makes a calf an ox, And brings all natural events to pass, Hath made him an Attorney of an Ass. No young divine, new-benefic'd, can be More pert, more proud, more positive than he. What further could I wish the fop to do, But turn a wit, and scribble verses too? Pierce the soft lab'rinth of a Lady's ear With rhymes of this per cent. and that per year? To court a wife, and spread his wily parts, Like nets or lime-twiggs, for rich widows hearts? Call himself Barrister to ev'ry wench, And wooe in language of the Pleas and Bench? Language, which Boreas might to Auster hold, More rough than forty Germans when they scold. Curs'd be the wretch so venal and so vain; Paltry and proud, as drabs in Drury-lane. 'Tis such a bounty as was never known, If Peter deigns to help you to your own: What thanks, what praise, if Peter but supplies! And what a solemn face if he denies! Grave, as when pris'ners shake the head, and swear 'Twas only Suretyship that brought 'em there. His Office keeps your Parchment-fates entire, He starves with cold to save them from the fire; For you, he walks the streets thro' rain or dust, For not in Chariots Peter puts his trust; For you he sweats and labours at the laws, Takes God to witness he affects your cause, And lies to every Lord in every thing, Like a King's Favourite—or like a King. These are the talents that adorn them all, From wicked Waters ev'n to godly— Not more of Simony beneath black gowns, Nor more of bastardy in heirs to Crowns. In shillings and in pence at first they deal, And steal so little, few perceive they steal; Till like the sea, they compass all the land, From Scots to Wight, from Mount to Dover strand. And when rank widows purchase luscious nights, Or when a Duke to Jansen punts at White's, Or city heir in mortagage melts away, Satan himself feels far less joy than they. Piecemeal they win this acre first, then that, Glean on, and gather up the whole estate. Then strongly fencing ill-got wealth by law, Indentures, Cov'nants, Articles they draw, Large as the fields themselves, and larger far Than civil Codes, with all their glosses are; So vast, our new Divines, we must confess, Are fathers of the Church for writing less. But let them write for you, each rogue impairs The deeds, and dextrously omits, ses heires: No commentator can more slily pass O'er a learn'd, unintelligible place; Or, in quotation, shrew'd divines leave out Those words, that would against them clear the doubt. So Luther thought the Pater noster long, When doom'd to say his beads and Evensong; But having cast his cowle, and left those laws, Adds to Christ's prayer, the Pow'r and Glory clause. The lands are bought; but where are to be found Those ancient woods, that shaded all the ground? We see no new-built palaces aspire, No kitchens emulate the vestal fire. Where are those troops of Poor, that throng'd of yore The good old landlord's hospitable door? Well, I could wish, that still in lordly domes Some beasts were kill'd, tho' not whole hecatombs; That both extremes were banish'd from their walls, Carthusian fasts, and fulsome Bacchanals; And all mankind might that just Mean observe, In which none e'er could surfeit, none could starve. These as good works 'tis true we all allow; But, oh! these works are not in fashion now: Like rich old wardrobes, things extremely rare, Extremely fine, but what no man will wear. Thus much I've said, I trust without offence; Let no Court Sycophant pervert my sense, Nor sly Informer watch these words to draw Within the reach of Treason, or the Law. THE FOURTH SATIRE OF Dr. JOHN DONNE. Well, if it be my time to quit the stage, Adieu to all the follies of the age! I die in charity with fool and knave, Secure of peace at least beyond the grave. I've had my purgatory here betimes, And paid for all my satires, all my rhymes. The Poet's hell, its tortures, fiends, and flames, To this were trifles, toys, and empty names. With foolish pride my heart was never fir'd, Nor the vain itch t'admire, or be admir'd; I hop'd for no commission from his Grace; I bought no benefice, I begg'd no place; Had no new verses, or new suit to show; Yet went to Court!—the Dev'l would have it so. But, as the fool that in reforming days Wou'd go to Mass in jest, (as story says) Could not but think, to pay his fine was odd, Since 'twas no form'd design of serving God: So was I punish'd, as if full as proud As prone to ill, as negligent of good, As deep in debt, without a thought to pay, As vain, as idle, and as false, as they Who live at Court, for going once that way! Scarce was I enter'd, when, behold! there came A thing which Adam had been pos'd to name; Noah had refus'd it lodging in his Ark, Where all the race of Reptiles might embark: A verier monster than on Africk's shore, The sun e'er got, or slimy Nilus bore, Or Sloane, or Woodward's wondrous shelves contain; Nay, all that lying Travellers can feign. The watch would hardly let him pass at noon; At night, wou'd swear him dropt out of the moon: One whom the mob, when next we find or make A Popish plot, shall for a Jesuit take; And the wise Justice starting from his chair Cry, by your Priesthood tell me what you are? Such was the wight: Th'apparel on his back Tho' coarse, was rev'rend, and tho' bare, was black: The suit, if by the fashion one might guess, Was velvet in the youth of good queen Bess, But mere tuff-taffety what now remain'd; So time that changes all things, had ordain'd! Our sons shall see it leisurely decay, First turn plain rash, then vanish quite away. This thing has travel'd, speaks each language too, And knows what's fit for every state to do; Of whose best phrase and courtly accent join'd, He forms one tongue, exotic and refin'd. Talkers, I've learn'd to bear; Motteux I knew, Henley himself I've heard, and Budgel too: The Doctor's Wormwood style, the Hash of tongues A Pedant makes, the storm of Gonson's lungs, The whole Artill'ry of the terms of War, And (all those plagues in one) the bawling Bar: These I cou'd bear; but not a rogue so civil, Whose tongue will complement you to the devil. A tongue that can cheat widows, cancel scores, Make Scots speak treason, cozen subtlest whores, With royal Favourites in flatt'ry vie, And Oldmixon and Burnet both out-lie. He spies me out, I whisper, gracious God! What sin of mine cou'd merit such a rod? That all the shot of dulness now must be From this thy blunderbuss discharg'd on me! Permit (he cries) no stranger to your fame To crave your sentiment, if ?'s your name. What Speech esteem you most?—“The King's, said I. But the best words?—“O Sir, the Dictionary. You miss my aim; I mean the most acute And perfect Speaker?—“Onslow, past dispute. But Sir, of writers? “Swift, for closer style, “But Ho??y for a period of a mile. Why yes, 'tis granted, these indeed may pass; Good common linguists, and so Panurge was; Nay, troth, th'Apostles (tho' perhaps too rough) Had once a pretty gift of tongues enough: Yet these were all poor Gentlemen! I dare Affirm, 'twas Travel made them what they were. Thus others talents having nicely shown, He came by sure transition to his own: Till I cry'd out, You prove your self so able, Pity! you was not Druggerman at Bable; For had they found a linguist half so good, I make no question but the Tow'r had stood. “Obliging Sir! for Courts you sure were made: “Why then for ever buried in the shade? “Spirits like you, should see and shou'd be seen, “The King would smile on you—at least the Queen. Ah gentle Sir! you Courtiers so cajol us— But Tully has it, Nunquam minus solus: And as for Courts, forgive me if I say No lessons now are taught the Spartan way: Tho' in his pictures Lust be full display'd, Few are the Converts Aretine has made; And tho' the Court show Vice exceeding clear, None shou'd, by my advice, learn Virtue there. At this entranc'd, he lifts his hands and eyes, Squeaks like a high-stretch'd lutestring, and replies: “Oh 'tis the sweetest of all earthly things “To gaze on Princes, and to talk of Kings! Then happy Man who shows the Tombs! said I, He dwells amidst the royal Family; He ev'ry day, from King to King can walk, Of all our Harries, all our Edwards talk, And get by speaking truth of monarchs dead, What few can of the living, Ease and Bread. “Lord, Sir, a meer mechanic! strangely low, “And coarse of phrase—your English all are so. “How elegant the Frenchman?—Mine, d'ye mean? I have but one, I hope the fellow's clean. “Oh! Sir, politely well! nay, let me die, “Your only wearing is your Padua-soy.” Not Sir my only, I have better still, And this you see is but my dishabille— Wild to get loose, his Patience I provoke, Mistake, confound, object at all he spoke. But as coarse iron, sharpen'd, mangles more, And itch most hurts when anger'd to a sore; So when you plague a fool, 'tis still the curse, You only make the matter worse and worse. He past it o'er; affects an easy smile At all my peevishness, and turns his style. He asks, “what News? I tell him of new Plays, New Eunuchs, Harlequins, and Operas. He hears, and as a Still with simples in it, Between each drop it gives, stays half a minute, Loth to enrich me with too quick replies, By little, and by little, drops his lies. Meer houshold trash! of birth-nights, balls, and shows, More than ten Hollingsheads, or Halls, or Stows. When the Queen frown'd, or smil'd, he knows; and what A subtle Minister may make of that? Who sins with whom? who got his Pension rug, Or quicken'd a Reversion by a drug? Whose place is quarter'd out, three parts in four, And whether to a Bishop or a Whore? Who, having lost his credit, pawn'd his rent, Is therefore fit to have a Government? Who in the secret, deals in Stocks secure, And cheats th'unknowing Widow and the Poor? Who makes a Trust, or Charity a Job, And gets an Act of Parliament to rob? Why Turnpikes rose, and now no Cit nor clown Can gratis see the country, or the town? Shortly no lad shall chuck, or lady vole, But some excising Courtier will have toll. He tells what strumpet places sells for life, What 'Squire his lands, what citizen his wife? And last (which proves him wiser still than all) What Lady's face is not a whited wall? As one of Woodward's patients, sick and sore, I puke, I nauseate,—yet he thrusts in more: Trims Europe's balance, tops the statesman's part, And talks Gazettes and Post-boys o'er by heart. Like a big wife, at sight of loathsome meat Ready to cast, I yawn, I sigh, I sweat. Then as a licens'd spy, whom nothing can Silence or hurt, he libels the great Man; Swears every place entail'd for years to come, In sure succession to the day of doom: He names the price for ev'ry office paid, And says our wars thrive ill, because delay'd: Nay hints, 'tis by connivance of the Court, That Spain robs on, and Dunkirk's still a Port. Not more amazement seiz'd on Circe's guests, To see themselves fall endlong into beasts, Than mine, to find a subject stay'd and wise Already half turn'd traytor by surprize. I felt th'infection slide from him to me, As in the pox, some give it to get free; And quick to swallow me, methought I saw One of our Giant Statutes ope its jaw! In that nice moment, as another lye Stood just a-tilt, the Minister came by. To him he flies, and bows, and bows again— Then close as Umbra, joins the dirty train. Not Fannius self more impudently near, When half his nose is in his Prince's ear. I quak'd at heart; and still afraid to see All the court fill'd with stranger things than he, Ran out as fast, as one that pays his bail And dreads more actions, hurries from a jail. Bear me, some God! oh quickly bear me hence To wholsome Solitude, the nurse of sense: There Contemplation prunes her ruffled wings, And the free soul looks down to pity Kings. There sober thought pursu'd th'amusing theme, Till Fancy colour'd it, and form'd a Dream. A vision hermits can to Hell transport, And force ev'n me to see the damn'd at Court. Not Dante dreaming all th'infernal state, Beheld such scenes of envy, sin, and hate. Base Fear becomes the guilty, not the free; Suits Tyrants, Plunderers, but suits not me: Shall I, the Terror of this sinful town, Care, if a livery'd Lord or smile or frown? Who cannot flatter, and detest who can, Tremble before a noble Serving-man? O my fair mistress, Truth! shall I quit thee, For huffing, braggart, puft Nobility? Thou who since yesterday hast roll'd o'er all The busy, idle blockheads of the ball, Hast thou, oh sun! beheld an emptier sort, Than such as swell this bladder of a court? Now pox on those who shew a A famous show of the Court of France in Waxwork. Court in wax! It ought to bring all courtiers on their backs: Such painted puppets, such a varnish'd race Of hollow gewgaws, only dress and face, Such waxen noses, stately staring things— No wonder some folks bow, and think them Kings. See! where the British youth, engag'd no more At Fig's Fig's, a Prize-fighter's Academy, where the young Nobility receiv'd instruction in those days: White's was a noted gaming-house: it was also customary for the nobility and gentry to visit the condemned criminals in Newgate. or White's, with felons, or a whore, Pay their last duty to the Court! and come All fresh and fragrant, to the drawing-room; In hues as gay, and odours as divine, As the fair fields they sold to look so fine. “That's velvet for a King!” the flatt'rer swears; 'Tis true, for ten days hence 'twill be King Lear's. Our court may justly to our stage give rules, That helps it both to fools-coats and to fools. And why not players strut in courtier's cloaths? For these are actors too, as well as those: Wants reach all states; they beg but better drest, And all is splendid poverty at best. Painted for sight, and essenc'd for the smell, Like frigates fraught with spice and cochine'l, Sail in the Ladies: How each pyrate eyes So weak a vessel, and so rich a prize! Top-gallant he, and she in all her trim, He boarding her, she striking sail to him: “Dear Countess! you have charms all hearts to hit! And “sweet Sir Fopling! you have so much wit! Such wits and beauties are not prais'd for nought, For both the beauty and the wit are bought. 'Twou'd burst ev'n Heraclitus with the spleen, To see those anticks, Fopling and Courtin: The Presence seems, with things so richly odd, The mosque of Mahound, or some queer Pa-god. See them survey their limbs by Durer's rules, Of all beau-kind the best-proportion'd fools! Adjust their cloaths, and to confession draw Those venial sins, an atom, or a straw: But, oh! what terrors must distract the soul Convicted of that mortal crime, a hole; Or should one pound of powder less bespread Those monkey-tails that wag behind their head! Thus finish'd, and corrected to a hair, They march, to prate their hour before the fair, So first to preach a white-glov'd Chaplain goes, With band of Lilly, and with cheek of Rose, Sweeter than Sharon, in immac'late trim, Neatness itself impertinent in him. Let but the Ladies smile, and they are blest: Prodigious! how the things protest, protest: Peace fools, or Gonson will for Papists seize you, If once he catch you at your Jesu! Jesu! Nature made ev'ry Fop to plague his brother, Just as one Beauty mortifies another. But here's the Captain that will plague them both, Whose air cries arm! whose very look's an oath: The Captain's honest, Sirs, and that's enough, Tho' his soul's bullet, and his body buff: He spits fore-right; his haughty chest before Like batt'ring rams, beats open ev'ry door; And with a face as red, and as awry, As Herod's hang-dogs in old Tapestry, Scarecrow to boys, the breeding woman's curse, Has yet a strange ambition to look worse; Confounds the civil, keeps the rude in awe, Jests like a licens'd fool, commands like law. Frighted I quit the room, but leave it so As men from Jayls to execution go; For hung with deadly Sins I see the wall, And lin'd with Giants, deadlier than 'em all: Each man an Askapart, of strength to toss For Quoits, both Temple-bar and Charing-cross. Scar'd at the grizly forms, I sweat, I fly, And shake all o'er, like a discover'd spy. Courts are no match for wits so weak as mine: Charge them with Heaven's Artill'ry, bold Divine! From such alone the Great rebukes endure, Whose satyr's sacred, and whose rage secure: 'Tis mine to wash a few slight stains, but theirs To deluge sin, and drown a Court in tears. Howe'er what's now Apocrypha, my Wit, In time to come, may pass for holy writ. EPITAPHS. His saltem accumulem donis, &amp; fungar inani Munere! Virg. I. On Sir William Trumbal, One of the Principal Secretaries of State to King William III. who having resigned his place, dyed in his Retirement at Easthamsted in Berkshire, 1716. A pleasing form; a firm, yet cautious Mind, Sincere, tho' prudent, constant, yet resign'd; Honour unchang'd, a Principle profest, Fix'd to one side, but mod'rate to the rest: An honest Courtier, yet a Patriot too, Just to his Prince, and to his Country true. Fill'd with the sense of Age, the fire of Youth, A Scorn of wrangling, yet a Zeal for truth, A gen'rous Faith, from superstition free; A love to Peace, and hate of Tyranny; Such this man was; who now from earth remov'd, At length enjoys that Liberty he lov'd. II. On Charles Earl of Dorset, In the Church of Withyham in Sussex. Dorset, the Grace of Courts, the Muses Pride, Patron of Arts, and Judge of Nature, dy'd! The Scourge of Pride, tho' sanctify'd or great, Of Fops in learning, and of Knaves in state: Yet soft his Nature, tho' severe his lay, His Anger moral, and his Wisdom gay. Blest Satyrist! who touch'd the mean so true, As show'd, vice had his hate and pity too. Blest Courtier! who could King and Country please, Yet sacred keep his Friendships, and his Ease. Blest Peer! his great Forefathers ev'ry grace Reflecting, and reflected in his Race; Where other Buckhursts, other Dorsets shine, And Patriots still, or Poets, deck the line. III. On the Hon??? Simon Harcouut, Only Son of the Lord Chancellor Harcourt: at the Church of Stanton-Harcourt in Oxfordshire. 1720. To this sad shrine, whoe'er thou art! draw near, Here lies the Friend most lov'd, the Son most dear: Who ne'er knew joy, but Friendship might divide, Or gave his Father grief but when he dy'd. How vain is Reason, Eloquence how weak! If Pope must tell what Harcourt cannot speak! Oh let thy once lov'd friend inscribe thy Stone, And, with a Father's sorrows, mix his own! IV. Intended for Mr. Rowe, In Westminster-Abby. Thy reliques, Rowe, to this fair tomb we trust, And sacred, place by Dryden's awful dust: Beneath a The Tomb of Mr. Dryden was erected upon this hint by the Duke of Buckingham; to which was originally intended this Epitaph, This Sheffield rais'd. The sacred Dust below Was Dryden once: The rest who does not know? which the Author since chang'd into the plain Inscription now upon it, being only the Name of that great Poet, DRYDEN./ Natus, Aug. 9. 1631./ Mortuus, Maij 1. 1701./ Johannes Sheffield. Dux Buckinghamiensis, fecit. rude and nameless stone he lies, To which thy Urn shall guide inquiring eyes. Peace to thy gentle shade, and endless rest, Blest in thy Genius, in thy Love too blest! One grateful woman to thy fame supplies What a whole thankless land to his denies. V. On Mrs. Corbet, Who dyed of a Cancer in her Breast. Here rests a Woman, good without pretence, Blest with plain Reason, and with sober Sense; No Conquest she, but o'er herself desir'd, No Arts essay'd, but not to be admir'd. Passion and Pride were to her soul unknown, Convinc'd that virtue only is our own. So unaffected, so compos'd a mind, So firm, yet soft; so strong, yet so refin'd; Heav'n as its purest gold, by Tortures try'd; The Saint sustain'd it, but the Woman dy'd. VI. On the Monument of the Honourable Robert Digby, and of his Sister Mary, erected by their Father the Lord Didby in the Church of Sherborne in Dorsetshine, 1727. Go! fair Example of untainted youth, Of modest wisdom, and pacifick truth; Compos'd in suff'rings, and in joy sedate, Good without noise, without pretension great! Just of thy word, in ev'ry thought sincere, Who knew no wish but what the world might hear: Of softest manners, unaffected mind, Lover of peace, and friend of human kind. Go live! for Heav'n's Eternal year is thine, Go, and exalt thy Moral to Divine. And thou blest Maid! attendant on his doom, Pensive hast follow'd to the silent tomb, Steer'd the same course to the same quiet shore, Not parted long, and now to part no more! Go then! where only bliss sincere is known, Go! where to love and to enjoy are one. Yet take these Tears, Mortality's relief, And till we share your joys, forgive our grief: These little rites, a Stone, a Verse, receive, 'Tis all a Father, all a Friend can give! VII. On Sir Godfrey Kneller, In Westminster-Abby, 1723. Kneller, by Heav'n and not a Master taught, Whose Art was Nature, and whose Pictures thought; Now for two ages having snatch'd from fate Whate'er was beauteous, or whate'er was great, Lies crown'd with Princes honours, Poets lays, Due to his Merit, and brave Thirst of praise. Imitated from the famous Epitaph on Raphael. —Raphael, timuit quo sospite, vinci Rerum magna parens, &amp; moriente, mori.Living, great Nature fear'd he might outvie Her works; and dying, fears herself may die. VIII. On General Henry Withers, In Westminster-Abbey, 1729. Here Withers rest! thou bravest, gentlest mind, Thy Country's friend, but more of Human kind. Oh born to Arms! O Worth in youth approv'd! Oh soft Humanity, in Age belov'd! For thee the hardy Vet'ran drops a tear, And the gay Courtier feels the sigh sincere. Withers adieu! yet not with thee remove Thy Martial spirit, or thy Social love! Amidst Corruption, Luxury, and Rage, Still leave some ancient virtues to our age: Nor let us say, (those English glories gone) The last true Briton lies beneath this stone. IX. On Mr. Elijah Fenton, At Easthamstead in Berks, 1730. This modest stone what few vain Marbles can May truly say, here lies an honest Man. A Poet, blest beyond the Poet's fate, Whom Heav'n kept sacred from the Proud and Great: Foe to loud praise, and Friend to learned ease, Content with science in the Vale of Peace. Calmly he look'd on either Life, and here Saw nothing to regret, or there to fear; From Nature's temp'rate feast rose satisfy'd, Thank'd heav'n that he had liv'd, and that he dy'd. X. On Mr. Gay, In Westminster-Abbey, 1732. Of Manners gentle, of Affections mild; In Wit, a Man; Simplicity, a Child: With native Humour temp'ring virtuous Rage, Form'd to delight, at once, and lash the age: Above Temptation, in a low estate, And uncorrupted, ev'n among the Great; A safe Companion, and an easy Friend, Unblam'd thro' life, lamented in thy end. These are Thy Honours! not that here thy Bust Is mix'd with Heroes, or with Kings thy dust; But that the Worthy and the Good shall say, Striking their pensive bosoms—Here lies Gay. XI. Intended for Sir Isaac Newton in Westminster-Abbey. ISAACUS NEWTONIUS:/ Quem Immortalem/ Testantur Tempus, Natura, Coelum:/ Mortalem Hoc marmor fatetur. Nature and Nature's Laws lay hid in Night: GOD said, Let Newton be! And all was Light.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. III. Consisting of FABLES, TRANSLATIONS, and IMITATIONS. ADVERTISEMENT. The following Translations were selected from many others done by the Author in his Youth; for the most part indeed but a sort of Exercises, while he was improving himself in the Languages, and carried by his early Bent to Poetry to perform them rather in Verse than Prose. Mr. Dryden's Fables came out about that time, which occasion'd the Translations from Chaucer. They were first separately printed in Miscellanies by J. Tonson and B. Lintot, and afterwards collected in the Quarto Edition of 1717. The Imitations of English Authors which are added at the end, were done as early, some of them at fourteen or fifteen Years old; but having also got into Miscellanies, we have put them here together to complete this Juvenile Volume. THE TEMPLE OF FAME. Written in the Year 1711. ADVERTISEMENT. The hint of the following piece was taken from Chaucer's House of Fame. The design is in a manner entirely alter'd, the descriptions and most of the particular thoughts my own: Yet I could not suffer it to be printed without this acknowledgment. The reader who would compare this with Chaucer, may begin with his third book of Fame, there being nothing in the two first books that answers to their title: Wherever any hint is taken from him, the passage itself is set down in the marginal notes. Ver. 1. In that soft season, &amp;c.] This Poem is introduced in the manner of the Provencial Poets, whose works were for the most part Visions, or pieces of imagination, and constantly descriptive. From these, Petrarch and Chaucer frequently borrow the idea of their poems. See the Trionfi of the former, and the Dream, Flower and the Leaf, &amp;c. of the latter. The Author of this therefore chose the same sort of Exordium. In that soft season when descending show'rs Call forth the greens, and wake the rising flow'rs; When opening buds salute the welcome day, And earth relenting feels the genial ray; As balmy sleep had charm'd my cares to rest, And love itself was banish'd from my breast, (What time the morn mysterious visions brings, While purer slumbers spread their golden wings) A train of phantoms in wild order rose, And, join'd, this intellectual scene compose. Ver. 11, &amp;c.] These verses are hinted from the following of Chaucer, Book 2. Tho beheld I fields and plains, Now hills, and now mountains, Now valeis, and now forestes, And now unneth great bestes, Now rivers, now citees, Now towns, now great trees, Now shippes sayling in the see.I stood, methought, betwixt earth, seas, and skies; The whole creation open to my eyes: In air self-ballanc'd hung the globe below, Where mountains rise, and circling oceans flow; Here naked rocks, and empty wastes were seen, There tow'ry cities, and the forests green: Here sailing ships delight the wand'ring eyes: There trees, and intermingl'd temples rise; Now a clear sun the shining scene displays, The transient landscape now in clouds decays. O'er the wide prospect as I gaz'd around, Sudden I heard a wild promiscuous sound, Like broken thunders that at distance roar, Or billows murm'ring on the hollow shore: Then gazing up, a glorious pile beheld, Whose tow'ring summit ambient clouds conceal'd. Ver. 27. High on a rock of ice, &amp;c.] Chaucer third book of Fame. It stood upon so high a rock, Higher standeth none in Spayne— What manner stone this rock was, For it was like a lymed glass, But that it shone full more clere; But of what congeled matere It was, I niste redily; But at the last espied I, And found that it was every dele, A rock of ise, and not of stele.High on a rock of Ice the structure lay, Steep its ascent, and slipp'ry was the way; The wond'rous rock like Parian marble shone, And seem'd, to distant sight, of solid stone. Ver. 31. Inscriptions here, &amp;c.] Tho saw I all the hill y-grave With famous folkes names fele, That had been in much wele And her fames wide y-blow; But well unneth might I know, Any letters for to rede Ther names by, for out of drede They weren almost off-thawen so, That of the letters one or two Were molte away of every name, So unfamous was woxe her fame; But men said, what may ever last.Inscriptions here of various Names I view'd, The greater part by hostile time subdu'd; Yet wide was spread their fame in ages past, And Poets once had promis'd they should last. Some fresh engrav'd appear'd of Wits renown'd; I look'd again, nor could their trace be found. Critics I saw, that other names deface, And fix their own, with labour, in their place: Their own, like others, soon their place resign'd, Or disappear'd, and left the first behind. Ver. 41. Nor was the work impair'd, &amp;c.] Tho' gan I in myne harte cast, That they were molte away for heate, And not away with stormes beate.Nor was the work impair'd by storms alone, But felt th'approaches of too warm a sun; For Fame, impatient of extreams, decays Not more by Envy than excess of Praise. Ver. 45. Yet part no injuries, &amp;c.] For on that other side I sey Of that hill which northward ley, How it was written full of names Of folke, that had afore great fames, Of old time, and yet they were As fresh, as men had written hem there The self day, or that houre That I on hem gan to poure: But well I wiste what it made; It was conserved with the shade (All the writing that I sye) Of the castle that stoode on high, And stood eke in so cold a place, That heate might it not deface.Yet part no injuries of heav'n could feel, Like crystal faithful to the graving steel: The rock's high summit, in the temple's shade, Nor heat could melt, nor beating storm invade. There names inscrib'd unnumber'd ages past From time's first birth, with time itself shall last; These ever new, nor subject to decays, Spread, and grow brighter with the length of days. So Zembla's rocks (the beauteous work of frost) Rise white in air, and glitter o'er the coast; Pale suns, unfelt, at distance roll away, And on th'impassive ice the lightnings play; Eternal snows the growing mass supply, 'Till the bright mountains prop th'incumbent sky: As Atlas fix'd, each hoary pile appears, The gather'd winter of a thousand years. On this foundation Fame's high temple stands; Stupendous pile! not rear'd by mortal hands. Whate'er proud Rome, or artful Greece beheld, Or elder Babylon, its frame excell'd. Ver. 65. Four faces had the dome, &amp;c.] The Temple is describ'd to be square, the four fronts with open gates facing the different quarters of the world, as an intimation that all nations of the earth may alike be receiv'd into it. The western front is of Grecian architecture: the Doric order was peculiarly sacred to Heroes and Worthies. Those whose statues are after mention'd, were the first names of old Greece in arms and arts.Four faces had the dome, and ev'ry face Of various structure, but of equal grace: Four brazen gates, on columns lifted high, Salute the different quarters of the sky. Here fabled Chiefs in darker ages born, Or Worthies old, whom arms or arts adorn, Who cities rais'd, or tam'd a monstrous race; The walls in venerable order grace: Heroes in animated marble frown, And Legislators seem to think in stone. Westward, a sumptuous frontispiece appear'd, On Doric pillars of white marble rear'd, Crown'd with an architrave of antique mold, And sculpture rising on the roughen'd gold. In shaggy spoils here Theseus was beheld, And Perseus dreadful with Minerva's shield: Ver. 81. There great Alcides, &amp;c.] This figure of Hercules is drawn with an eye to the position of the famous statue of Farnese.There great Alcides stooping with his toil, Rests on his club, and holds th'Hesperian spoil. Here Orpheus sings; trees moving to the sound Start from their roots, and form a shade around: Amphion there the loud creating lyre Strikes, and behold a sudden Thebes aspire! Cythæron's echoes answer to his call, And half the mountain rolls into a wall: There might you see the length'ning spires ascend, The domes swell up, the widening arches bend, The growing tow'rs like exhalations rise, And the huge columns heave into the skies. The Eastern front was glorious to behold, With diamond flaming, and Barbaric gold. There Ninus shone, who spread th'Assyrian fame, Ver. 96. And the great Founder of the Persian, Name.] Cyrus was the beginner of the Persian, as Ninus was of the Assyrian Monarchy. The Magi and Chaldeans (the chief of whom was Zoroaster) employ'd their studies upon magic and astrology, which was in a manner almost all the learning of the antient Asian people. We have scarce any account of a moral philosopher except Confucius, the great law-giver of the Chinese, who liv'd about two thousand years ago.And the great founder of the Persian name: There in long robes the royal Magi stand, Grave Zoroaster waves the circling wand, The sage Chaldæans robe'd in white appear'd, And Brachmans, deep in desart woods rever'd. These stop'd the moon, and call'd th'unbody'd shades To midnight banquets in the glimmering glades; Made visionary fabricks round them rise, And airy spectres skim before their eyes; Of Talismans and Sigils knew the pow'r, And careful watch'd the Planetary hour. Superior, and alone, Confucius stood, Who taught that useful science, to be good. But on the south, a long, majestic race Ver. 110. Ægypt's Priests, &amp;c.] The learning of the old Ægyptian Priests consisted for the most part in geometry and astronomy: They also preserv'd the History of their nation. Their greatest Hero upon record is Sesostris, whose actions and conquests may be seen at large in Diodorus, &amp;c. He is said to have caus'd the Kings he vanquish'd to draw him in his Chariot. The posture of his statue, in these verses, is correspondent to the description which Herodotus gives of one of them remaining in his own time.Of Ægypt's Priests the gilded niches grace, Who measur'd earth, describ'd the starry spheres, And trac'd the long records of lunar years. High on his car Sesostris struck my view, Whom scepter'd slaves in golden harness drew: His hands a bow and pointed javelin hold; His giant limbs are arm'd in scales of gold. Between the statues Obelisks were plac'd, And the learn'd walls with Hieroglyphics grac'd. Ver. 119. Of Gothic structure was the Northern side.] The Architecture is agreeable to that part of the world. The learning of the Northern nations lay more obscure than that of the rest; Zamolxis was the disciple of Pythagoras, who taught the immortality of the soul to the Scythians. Odin, or Woden, was the great legislator and hero of the Goths. They tell us of him, that being subject to fits, he persuaded his followers that during those trances he receiv'd inspirations, from whence he dictated his laws: he is said to have been the inventor of the Runic characters.Of Gothic structure was the northern side, O'er-wrought with ornaments of barb'rous pride. There huge Colosses rose, with trophies crown'd, And Runic characters were grav'd around. There sate Zamolxis with erected eyes, And Odin here in mimic trances dies. There on rude iron columns smear'd with blood, The horrid forms of Scythian heroes stood, Ver. 127. Druids and Bards, &amp;c.] These were the priests and poets of those people, so celebrated for their savage virtue. Those heroic barbarians accounted it a dishonour to die in their beds, and rush'd on to certain death in the prospect of an after-life, and for the glory of a song from their bards in praise of their actions.Druids and Bards (their once loud harps unstrung) And youths that dy'd to be by Poets sung. These and a thousand more of doubtful fame, To whom old fables gave a lasting name, In ranks adorn'd the temples outward face; Ver. 132. The wall in lustre, &amp;c.] It shone lighter than a glass, And made well more than it was, As kind thing of Fame is.The wall in lustre and effect like Glass, Which o'er each object casting various dyes, Enlarges some, and others multiplies: Nor void of emblem was the mystic wall, For thus romantic Fame increases all. The Temple shakes, the sounding gates unfold, Wide vaults appear, and roofs of fretted gold: Rais'd on a thousand pillars, wreath'd around With laurel-foliage, and with eagles crown'd: Of bright, transparent beryl were the walls, The freezes gold, and gold the capitals: As heav'n with stars, the roof with jewels glows, And ever-living lamps depend in rows. Full in the passage of each spacious gate, The sage Historians in white garments wait; Grav'd o'er their seats the form of Time was found, His scythe revers'd, and both his pinions bound. Within, stood Heroes who thro' loud alarms In bloody fields pursu'd renown in arms. High on a throne with trophies charg'd, I view'd Ver. 152. The youth that all things but himself subdu'd.] Alexander the Great: The Tiara was the crown peculiar to the Asian Princes: his desire to be thought the son of Jupiter Ammon, caus'd him to wear the horns of that God, and to represent the same upon his coins; which was continued by several of his successors.The Youth that all things but himself subdu'd; His feet on sceptres and Tiara's trod, And his horn'd head bely'd the Lybian God. There Cæsar, grac'd with both Minerva's, shone; Cæsar, the world's great master, and his own; Unmov'd, superior still in ev'ry state, And scarce detested in his Country's fate. But chief were those, who not for empire fought, But with their toils their people's safety bought: High o'er the rest Epaminondas stood; Ver. 162. Timoleon, glorious in his brother's blood.] Timoleon had sav'd the life of his brother Timophanes in the battle between the Argives and Corinthians; but afterwards kill'd him when he affected the tyranny, preferring his duty to his country to all the obligations of blood. Timoleon, glorious in his brother's blood; Bold Scipio, saviour of the Roman state, Great in his triumphs, in retirement great; And wise Aurelius, in whose well-taught mind With boundless pow'r unbounded virtue join'd, His own strict judge, and patron of mankind. Much-suff'ring heroes next their honours claim, Those of less noisy, and less guilty fame, Fair Virtue's silent train: supreme of these Here ever shines the godlike Socrates: Ver. 172. He whom ungrateful Athens, &amp;c.] Aristides, who for his great integrity was distinguish'd by the appellation of the Just. When his countrymen would have banish'd him by the Ostracism, where it was the custom for every man to sign the name of the person he voted to exile in an oyster-shell; a peasant, who could not write, came to Aristides to do it for him, who readily sign'd his own name.He whom ungrateful Athens could expel, At all times just, but when he sign'd the Shell: Here his abode the martyr'd Phocion claims, With Agis, not the last of Spartan names: Unconquer'd Cato shews the wound he tore, And Brutus his ill Genius meets no more. Ver. 178. But in the centre of the hallow'd quire, &amp;c.] In the midst of the temple, nearest the throne of Fame, are plac'd the greatest names in learning of all antiquity. These are describ'd in such attitudes as express their different characters: The columns on which they are rais'd are adorn'd with sculptures, taken from the most striking subjects of their works; which sculpture bears a resemblance in its manner and character, to the manner and character of their writings.But in the centre of the hallow'd quire, Ver. 179. Six pompous columns, &amp;c.] From the dees many a pillere, Of metal that shone not full clere, &amp;c. Upon a pillere saw I stonde That was of lede and iron fine, Him of the sect Saturnine, The Ebraicke Josephus the old, &amp;c. Upon an iron piller strong, That painted was all endlong, With tygers blood in every place, The Tholosan that hight Stace, That bare of Thebes up the name, &amp;c.Six pompous columns o'er the rest aspire; Around the shrine itself of Fame they stand, Hold the chief honours, and the fane command. Ver. 182.] Full wonder hye on a pillere Of iron, he the great Omer, And with him Dares and Titus, &amp;c.High on the first, the mighty Homer shone; Eternal Adamant compos'd his throne; Father of verse! in holy fillets drest, His silver beard wav'd gently o'er his breast; Tho' blind, a boldness in his looks appears; In years he seem'd, but not impair'd by years. The wars of Troy were round the pillar seen: Here fierce Tydides wounds the Cyprian Queen; Here Hector glorious from Patroclus' fall, Here dragg'd in triumph round the Trojan wall. Motion and life did ev'ry part inspire, Bold was the work, and prov'd the master's fire; A strong expression most he seem'd t'affect, And here and there disclos'd a brave neglect. Ver. 196, &amp;c.] There saw I stand on a pillere That was of tinned iron clere, The Latin Poet Virgyle, That hath bore up a great while The fame of pius Eneas: And next him on a pillere was Of copper, Venus clerke Ovide, That hath sowen wondrous wide The great God of Love's fame— Tho saw I on a pillere by Of iron wrought full sternly, The great Poet Dan Lucan, That on his shoulders bore up then As hye as that I might see, The fame of Julius and Pompee. And next him on a pillere stode Of sulphur, like as he were wode, Dan Claudian, sothe for to tell, That bare up all the fame of hell, &amp;c.A golden column next in rank appear'd, On which a shrine of purest gold was rear'd; Finish'd the whole, and labour'd ev'ry part, With patient touches of unweary'd art: The Mantuan there in sober triumph sate, Compos'd his posture, and his look sedate; On Homer still he fix'd a rev'rend eye, Great without pride, in modest majesty. In living sculpture on the sides were spread The Latian wars, and haughty Turnus dead; Eliza stretch'd upon the fun'ral pyre, Æneas bending with his aged fire: Troy flam'd in burnish'd gold, and o'er the throne Arms and the man in golden cyphers shone. Ver. 210. Four Swans sustain, &amp;c.] Pindar being seated in a chariot, alludes to the chariot-races he celebrated in the Grecian games. The swans are emblems of Poetry, their soaring posture intimates the sublimity and activity of his genius. Neptune presided over the Isthmian, and Jupiter over the Olympian games.Four swans sustain a car of silver bright, With heads advanc'd, and pinions stretch'd for flight: Here, like some furious prophet, Pindar rode, And seem'd to labour with th'inspiring God. Across the harp a careless hand he flings, And boldly sinks into the sounding strings. The figur'd games of Greece the column grace, Neptune and Jove survey the rapid race: The youths hang o'er their chariots as they run; The fiery steeds seem starting from the stone; The champions in distorted postures threat; And all appear'd irregularly great. Here happy Horace tun'd th'Ausonian lyre To sweeter sounds, and temper'd Pindar's fire: Ver. 224. Pleas'd with Alcæus' manly rage t'infuse The softer spirit of the Saphic Muse. This expresses the mixt character of the odes of Horace: the second of these verses alludes to that line of his, Spiritum Graiæ tenuem camœnæ. As another which follows, to Exegi monumentum ære perennius. The action of the Doves hints at a passage in the 4th ode of his third book, Me fabulosæ vulture in Appulo, Altricis extra limen Apuliæ, Ludo fatigatumque somno, Fronde nova puerum palumbes Texére; mirum quod foret omnibus— Ut tuto ab atris corpore viperis Dormirem &amp; ursis; ut premerer sacra Lauroque, collataque myrto, Non sine Dis animosus infans. Which may be thus english'd; While yet a child, I chanc'd to stray, And in a desart sleeping lay; The savage race withdrew, nor dar'd To touch the Muses future bard: But Cytheræa's gentle dove Myrtles and Bays around me spread, And crown'd your infant Poet's head, Sacred to Music and to Love.Pleas'd with Alcæus' manly rage t'infuse The softer spirit of the Saphic Muse. The polish'd pillar different sculptures grace; A work outlasting monumental brass. Here smiling Loves and Bacchanals appear, The Julian star and great Augustus here. The Doves that round the infant Poet spread Myrtles and bays, hung hov'ring o'er his head. Here in a shrine that cast a dazling light, Sate fix'd in thought the mighty Stagyrite; His sacred head a radiant Zodiac crown'd, And various Animals his sides surround; His piercing eyes, erect, appear to view Superiour worlds, and look all Nature thro'. With equal rays immortal Tully shone, The Roman Rostra deck'd the Consul's throne: Gath'ring his flowing robe, he seem'd to stand In act to speak, and graceful stretch'd his hand. Behind, Rome's Genius waits with Civic crowns, And the great Father of his country owns. These massy columns in a circle rise, O'er which a pompous dome invades the skies: Scarce to the top I stretch'd my aking sight, So large it spread, and swell'd to such a height. Full in the midst proud Fame's imperial seat With jewels blaz'd, magnificently great; The vivid em'ralds there revive the eye, The flaming rubies shew their sanguine dye, Bright azure rays from lively saphyrs stream, And lucid amber casts a golden gleam. With various-colour'd light the pavement shone, And all on fire appear'd the glowing throne; The dome's high arch reflects the mingled blaze, And forms a rainbow of alternate rays. When on the Goddess first I cast my sight, Ver. 259. Scarce seem'd her stature, &amp;c.] Methought that she was so lite, That the length of a cubite, Was longer than she seemed be; But thus soone in a while she, Her selfe tho wonderly straight, That with her feet she th'earth reight, And with her head she touchyd heaven—Scarce seem'd her stature of a cubit's height; But swell'd to larger size, the more I gaz'd, Till to the roof her tow'ring front she rais'd. With her, the Temple ev'ry moment grew, And ampler Vista's open'd to my view: Upward the columns shoot, the roofs ascend, And arches widen, and long iles extend. Such was her form, as antient bards have told, Wings raise her arms, and wings her feet infold; A thousand busy tongues the Goddess bears, And thousand open eyes, and thousand list'ning ears. Ver. 270. Beneath, in order rang'd, &amp;c.] I heard about her throne y-sung That all the palays walls rung, So sung the mighty muse, she That cleped is Calliope, And her seven sisters eke—Beneath, in order rang'd, the tuneful Nine (Her virgin handmaids) still attend the shrine: With eyes on Fame for ever fix'd, they sing; For Fame they raise the voice, and tune the string; With time's first birth began the heav'nly lays, And last, eternal, thro' the length of days. Ver. 276. Around these wonders, &amp;c.] I heard a noise approchen blive, That far'd as bees done in a hive, Against her time of out flying; Right such a manere murmuring, For all the world it seemed me. Tho gan I look about and see That there came entring into th'hall, A right great company withal; And that of sondry regions, Of all kind of conditions,—&amp;c.Around these wonders as I cast a look, The trumpet sounded, and the Temple shook, And all the Nations summon'd at the call, From diff'rent quarters fill the crouded hall: Of various tongues the mingled sounds were heard; In various garbs promiscuous throngs appear'd; Thick as the bees, that with the spring renew Their flow'ry toils, and sip the fragrant dew, When the wing'd colonies first tempt the sky, O'er dusky fields and shaded waters fly, Or settling, seize the sweets the blossoms yield, And a low murmur runs along the field. Millions of suppliant crouds the shrine attend, And all degrees before the Goddess bend; The poor, the rich, the valiant, and the sage, And boasting youth, and narrative old-age. Their pleas were diff'rent, their request the same; For good and bad alike are fond of Fame. Ver. 294. Some she disgrac'd, &amp;c.] And some of them she granted sone, And some she warned well and fair, And some she granted the contrair— Right as her sister dame Fortune Is wont to serve in commune.Some she disgrac'd, and some with honours crown'd; Unlike successes equal merits found. Thus her blind sister, sickle Fortune reigns, And undiscerning, scatters crowns and chains. First at the shrine the Learned world appear, And to the Goddess thus prefer their pray'r. Long have we sought t'instruct and please mankind, With studies pale, with midnight vigils blind; But thank'd by few, rewarded yet by none, We here appeal to thy superior throne: On wit and learning the just prize bestow, For Fame is all we must expect below. The Goddess heard, and bade the Muses raise The golden Trumpet of eternal Praise: From pole to pole the winds diffuse the sound, That fills the circuit of the world around; Not all at once, as thunder breaks the cloud; The notes at first were rather sweet than loud: By just degrees they ev'ry moment rise, Fill the wide earth, and gain upon the skies. At ev'ry breath were balmy odours shed, Which still grew sweeter as they wider spread: Less fragrant scents th'unfolding rose exhales, Or spices breathing in Arabian gales. Ver. 318. The good and just, &amp;c.] Tho came the third companye, And gan up to the dees to hye, And down on knees they fell anone, And saiden: We ben everichone Folke that han full truely Deserved Fame right-fully, And prayen you it might be knowe Right as it is, and forth blowe. I grant, quoth she, for now me list That your good works shall be wist, And yet ye shall have better loos, Right in despite of all your foos, Than worthy is, and that anone. Let now (quoth she) thy trump gone— And certes all the breath that went Out of his trump's mouth smel'd As men a pot of baume held Among a basket full of roses—Next these the good and just, an awful train, Thus on their knees address'd the sacred fane. Since living virtue is with envy curs'd, And the best men are treated like the worst, Do thou, just Goddess, call our merits forth, And give each deed th'exact, intrinsic worth. Not with bare justice shall your act be crown'd, (Said Fame) but high above desert renown'd: Let fuller notes th'applauding world amaze, And the loud clarion labour in your praise. Ver. 328. Behold another croud, &amp;c.] 338. From the blank trumpet's rusty, &amp;c.] Therewithal there came anone Another huge companye, Of goode folke— What did this Eolus, but he Tooke out his trump of brass, That fouler than the devil was: And gan this trump for to blowe, As all the world should overthrowe. Throughout every regione Went this foul trumpet's soune, Swift as a pellet out of a gunne When fire is in the powder runne. And suche a smoke gan out wende, Out of the foul trumpes ende,—&amp;c.This band dismiss'd, behold another croud Prefer'd the same request, and lowly bow'd; The constant tenour of whose well-spent days No less deserv'd a just return of praise. But strait the direful Trump of Slander sounds; Thro' the big dome the doubling thunder bounds; Loud as the burst of cannon rends the skies, The dire report thro' ev'ry region flies: In ev'ry ear incessant rumours rung, And gath'ring scandals grew on ev'ry tongue. From the black trumpet's rusty concave broke Sulphureous flames, and clouds of rolling smoke: The pois'nous vapour blots the purple skies, And withers all before it as it flies. A troop came next, who crowns and armour wore, And proud defiance in their looks they bore: For thee (they cry'd) amidst alarms and strife, We sail'd in tempests down the stream of life; For thee whole nations fill'd with flames and blood, And swam to empire thro' the purple flood. Those ills we dar'd, thy inspiration own, What virtue seem'd, was done for thee alone. Ambitious fools! (the Queen reply'd, and frown'd) Be all your acts in dark oblivion drown'd; There sleep forgot, with mighty tyrants gone, Your statues moulder'd, and your names unknown! A sudden cloud strait snatch'd them from my sight, And each majestic phantom sunk in night. Ver. 356. Then came the smallest, &amp;c.] I saw anone the fifth route That to this lady gan loute, And downe on knees anon to fall, And to her they besoughten all, To hiden their good workes eke; And said, they yeve not a leke For no fame ne such renowne; For they for contemplacyoune, And Goddes love had it wrought, Ne of fame would they ought. What, quoth she, and be ye wood? And ween ye for to do good, And for to have of it no fame? Have ye despite to have my name? Nay ye shall lien everichone: Blowe thy trump, and that anone (Quoth she) thou Eolus, I hote, And ring these folkes workes by rote, That all the world may of it heare; And he gan blow their loos so cleare, In his golden clarioune, Through the world went the soune, All so kindly, and eke so soft, That their fame was blowen aloft.Then came the smallest tribe I yet had seen; Plain was their dress, and modest was their mien. Great idol of mankind! we neither claim The praise of merit, nor aspire to fame! But safe in desarts from th'applause of men, Would die unheard of, as we liv'd unseen. 'Tis all we beg thee, to conceal from sight Those acts of goodness, which themselves requite. O let us still the secret joy partake, To follow virtue ev'n for virtue's sake. And live there men who slight immortal fame? Who then with incense shall adore our name? But mortals! know, 'tis still our greatest pride To blaze those virtues which the good would hide. Rise! Muses, rise, add all your tuneful breath, These must not sleep in darkness and in death. She said: in air the trembling music floats, And on the winds triumphant swell the notes; So soft, tho' high, so loud, and yet so clear, Ev'n list'ning Angels lean'd from heav'n to hear: To farthest shores th'Ambrosial spirit flies, Sweet to the world, and grateful to the skies. Ver. 378. Next these a youthful train, &amp;c.] The reader may compare these twenty eight lines following, which contain the same matter with eighty four of Tho came the sixth companye, And gan faste to Fame crye, &amp;c. being too prolix to be here inserted.Next these a youthful train their vows express'd, With feathers crown'd, with gay embroidery dress'd; Hither, they cry'd, direct your eyes, and see The men of pleasure, dress, and gallantry; Ours is the place at banquets, balls, and plays, Sprightly our nights, polite are all our days; Courts we frequent, where 'tis our pleasing care To pay due visits, and address the fair: In fact, 'tis true, no nymph we could persuade, But still in fancy vanquish'd ev'ry maid; Of unknown Duchesses leud tales we tell, Yet would the world believe us, all were well. The joy let others have, and we the name, And what we want in pleasure, grant in fame. The Queen assents, the trumpet rends the skies, And at each blast a Lady's honour dies. Pleas'd with the strange success, vast numbers prest Around the shrine, and made the same request: What you (she cry'd) unlearn'd in arts to please, Slaves to yourselves, and ev'n fatigu'd with ease, Who lose a length of undeserving days, Would you usurp the lover's dear-bought praise? To just contempt, ye vain pretenders, fall, The people's fable, and the scorn of all. Strait the black clarion sends a horrid sound, Loud laughs burst out, and bitter scoffs fly round, Whispers are heard, with taunts reviling loud, And scornful hisses run thro' all the croud. Ver. 406. Last, those who boast of mighty, &amp;c.] Tho came another companye, That had y-done the treachery, &amp;c.Last, those who boast of mighty mischiefs done, Enslave their country, or usurp a throne; Or who their glory's dire foundation lay'd On Sov'reigns ruin'd, or on friends betray'd: Calm, thinking villains, whom no faith could fix, Of crooked counsels and dark politicks; Of these, a gloomy tribe surround the throne, And beg to make th'immortal treasons known. The trumpet roars, long flaky flames expire, With sparks, that seem'd to set the world on fire. At the dread sound, pale mortals stood aghast, And startled nature trembled with the blast. Ver. 418. Thus having heard and seen, &amp;c.] The Scene here changes from the temple of Fame to that of Rumour, which is almost entirely Chaucer's. The particulars follow. Tho saw I stonde in a valey, Under the castle fast by A house, that Domus Dedali That Labyrinthus cleped is, Nas made so wonderly, I wis, Ne half so queintly y-wrought; And evermo, as swift as thought, This queint house about went, That nevermore it still stent— And eke this house hath of entrees As many as leaves are on trees, In summer, when they ben grene; And in the roof yet men may sene A thousand holes and well mo, To letten the soune out go; And by day in every tide Ben all the doors open wide, And by night each one unshet; No porter is there one to let, No maner tydings in to pace; Ne never rest is in that place.This having heard and seen, some pow'r unknown Strait chang'd the scene, and snatch'd me from the throne. Before my view appear'd a structure fair, Its site uncertain, if in earth or air; With rapid motion turn'd the mansion round; With ceaseless noise the ringing walls resound: Not less in number were the spacious doors, Than leaves on trees, or sands upon the shores; Which still unfolded stand, by night, by day, Pervious to winds, and open ev'ry way. Ver. 428. As Flames by nature to the, &amp;c.] This thought is transferr'd hither out of the third book of Fame, where it takes up no less than 120 Verses, beginning thus, Geffray, thou wottest well this, &amp;c.As flames by nature to the skies ascend, As weighty bodies to the centre tend, As to the sea returning rivers roll, And the touch'd needle trembles to the pole; Hither, as to their proper place, arise All various sounds from earth, and seas, and skies, Or spoke aloud, or whisper'd in the ear; Nor ever silence, rest, or peace is here. As on the smooth expanse of crystal lakes, The sinking stone at first a circle makes; The trembling surface, by the motion stir'd, Spreads in a second circle, then a third; Wide, and more wide, the floating rings advance, Fill all the wat'ry plain, and to the margin dance. Thus ev'ry voice and sound, when first they break, On neighb'ring air a soft impression make; Another ambient circle then they move; That, in its turn, impels the next above; Thro' undulating air the sounds are sent, And spread o'er all the fluid element. Ver. 448. These various news I heard, &amp;c.] Of werres, of peace, of marriages, Of rest, of labour, of voyages, Of abode, of dethe, and of life, Of love and hate, accord and strife, Of loss, of lore, and of winnings, Of hele, of sickness, and lessings, Of divers transmutations Of estates and eke of regions, Of trust, of drede, of jealousy, Of witt, of winning, of folly, Of good, or bad government, Of fire, and of divers accident.There various news I heard, of love and strife, Of peace and war, health, sickness, death, and life, Of loss and gain, of famine and of store, Of storms at sea, and travels on the shore, Of prodigies, and portents seen in air, Of fires and plagues, and stars with blazing hair, Of turns of fortune, changes in the state, The falls of fav'rites, projects of the great, Of old mismanagements, taxations new: All neither wholly false, nor wholly true. Ver. 458. Above, below, without, within, &amp;c.] But such a grete Congregation Of folke as I saw rome about, Some within, and some without, Was never seen, ne shall be eft— And every wight that I saw there Rowned everich in others ear A new tyding privily, Or else he told it openly Right thus, and said, Knowst not thou That is betide to night now? No, quoth he, tell me what? And then he told him this and that, &amp;c. —Thus north and south Went every tiding fro mouth to mouth, And that encreasing evermo, As fire is wont to quicken and go From a sparkle sprong amiss, Till all the citee brent up is.Above, below, without, within, around, Confus'd, unnumber'd multitudes are found, Who pass, repass, advance, and glide away; Hosts rais'd by fear, and phantoms of a day: Astrologers, that future fates foreshew, Projectors, quacks, and lawyers not a few; And priests, and party-zealots, num'rous bands With home-born lyes, or tales from foreign lands; Each talk'd aloud, or in some secret place, And wild impatience star'd in ev'ry face. The flying rumors gather'd as they roll'd, Scarce any tale was sooner heard than told; And all who told it, added something new, And all who heard it, made enlargements too, In ev'ry ear it spread, on ev'ry tongue it grew. Thus flying east and west, and north and south, News travell'd with encrease from mouth to mouth. So from a spark, that kindled first by chance, With gath'ring force the quick'ning flames advance; Till to the clouds their curling heads aspire, And tow'rs and temples sink in floods of fire. When thus ripe lyes are to perfection sprung, Full grown, and sit to grace a mortal tongue, Thro' thousand vents, impatient forth they flow, And rush in millions on the world below. Fame sits aloft, and points them out their course, Their date determines, and prescribes their force: Some to remain, and some to perish soon; Or wane and wax alternate like the moon. Around, a thousand winged wonders fly, Born by the trumpet's blast, and scatter'd thro' the sky. Ver. 489. There at one passage, &amp;c.] And sometime I saw there at once, A lesing and a sad sooth saw That gonnen at adventure draw Out of a window forth to pace— And no man, be he ever so wrothe, Shall have one of these two, but bothe, &amp;c.There, at one passage, oft' you might survey A lye and truth contending for the way; And long 'twas doubtful, both so closely pent, Which first should issue thro' the narrow vent: At last agreed, together out they fly, Inseparable now, the truth and lye; The strict companions are for ever join'd, And this or that unmix'd, no mortal e'er shall find. Ver. 497. While thus I stood, &amp;c.] The hint is taken from a passage in another part of the third book, but here more naturally made the conclusion, with the addition of a Moral to the whole. In Chaucer, he only answers “he came to see the place; and the book ends abruptly, with his being surprized at the sight of a Man of great Authority, and awaking in a fright.While thus I stood, intent to see and hear, One came, methought, and whisper'd in my ear: What could thus high thy rash ambition raise? Art thou, fond youth, a candidate for praise? 'Tis true, said I, not void of hopes I came, For who so fond as youthful bards of Fame? But few, alas! the casual blessing boast, So hard to gain, so easy to be lost. How vain that second life in others breath, Th'estate which wits inherit after death! Ease, health, and life, for this they must resign, (Unsure the tenure, but how vast the fine!) The great man's curse, without the gains, endure, Be envy'd, wretched, and be flatter'd, poor; All luckless wits their enemies profest, And all successful, jealous friends at best. Nor Fame I slight, nor for her favours call; She comes unlook'd for, if she comes at all. But if the purchase costs so dear a price, As soothing Folly, or exalting Vice: Oh! if the Muse must flatter lawless sway, And follow still where fortune leads the way; Or if no basis bear my rising name, But the fall'n ruins of another's fame: Then teach me, heav'n! to scorn the guilty bays, Drive from my breast that wretched lust of praise, Unblemish'd let me live, or die unknown; Oh grant an honest fame, or grant me none! SAPHO TO PHAON. From OVID. Say, lovely youth, that do'st my heart command, Can Phaon's eyes forget his Sapho's hand? Must then her Name the wretched writer prove, To thy remembrance lost, as to thy love? Ask not the cause that I new numbers chuse, The Lute neglected, and the Lyric muse; Love taught my tears in sadder notes to flow, And tun'd my heart to Elegies of woe. I burn, I burn, as when thro' ripen'd corn By driving winds the spreading flames are born! Phaon to Ætna's scorching fields retires, While I consume with more than Ætna's fires! No more my soul a charm in music finds, Music has charms alone for peaceful minds. Soft scenes of solitude no more can please, Love enters there, and I'm my own disease. No more the Lesbian dames my passion move, Once the dear objects of my guilty love; All other loves are lost in only thine, Ah youth ungrateful to a flame like mine! Whom would not all those blooming charms surprize, Those heav'nly looks, and dear, deluding eyes? The harp and bow would you like Phœbus bear, A brighter Phœbus, Phaon might appear; Would you with ivy wreath your flowing hair, Not Bacchus' self with Phaon could compare: Yet Phœbus lov'd, and Bacchus felt the flame, One Daphne warm'd, and one the Cretan dame, Nymphs that in verse no more could rival me, Than ev'n those Gods contend in charms with thee. The Muses teach me all their softest lays, And the wide world resounds with Sapho's praise. Tho' great Alcæus more sublimely sings, And strikes with bolder rage the sounding strings, No less renown attends the moving lyre, Which Venus tunes, and all her loves inspire. To me what nature has in charms deny'd, Is well by wit's more lasting charms supply'd. Tho' short my stature, yet my name extends To heav'n itself, and earth's remotest ends. Brown as I am, an Æthiopian dame Inspir'd young Perseus with a gen'rous flame. Turtles and doves of diff'ring hues, unite, And glossy jett is pair'd with shining white. If to no charms thou wilt thy heart resign, But such as merit, such as equal thine, By none alas! by none thou can'st be mov'd, Phaon alone by Phaon must be lov'd! Yet once thy Sapho could thy cares employ, Once in her arms you center'd all your joy: Still all those joys to my remembrance move, For oh! how vast a memory has Love? My music, then, you could for ever hear, And all my words were music to your ear. You stop'd with kisses my inchanting tongue, And found my kisses sweeter than my song. In all I pleas'd, but most in what was best; And the last joy was dearer than the rest. Then with each word, each glance, each motion fir'd, You still enjoy'd, and yet you still desir'd, Till all dissolving in the trance we lay, And in tumultuous raptures dy'd away. The fair Sicilians now thy soul inflame; Why was I born, ye Gods, a Lesbian dame? But ah beware, Sicilian nymphs! nor boast That wandring heart which I so lately lost; Nor be with all those tempting words abus'd, Those tempting words were all to Sapho us'd. And you that rule Sicilia's happy plains, Have pity, Venus, on your Poet's pains! Shall fortune still in one sad tenor run, And still increase the woes so soon begun? Enur'd to sorrows from my tender years, My parent's ashes drank my early tears: My brother next, neglecting wealth and fame, Ignobly burn'd in a destructive flame: An infant daughter late my griefs increas'd, And all a mother's cares distract my breast. Alas, what more could fate itself impose, But thee, the last and greatest of my woes? No more my robes in waving purple flow, Nor on my hand the sparkling diamonds glow; No more my locks in ringlets curl'd diffuse The costly sweetness of Arabian dews, Nor braids of gold the vary'd tresses bind, That fly disorder'd with the wanton wind: For whom should Sapho use such arts as these? He's gone, whom only she desir'd to please! Cupid's light darts my tender bosom move, Still is there cause for Sapho still to love: So from my birth the Sisters fix'd my doom, And gave to Venus all my life to come; Or while my Muse in melting notes complains, My yielding heart keeps measure to my strains. By charms like thine which all my soul have won, Who might not—ah! who would not be undone? For those Aurora Cephalus might scorn, And with fresh blushes paint the conscious morn. For those might Cynthia lengthen Phaon's sleep, And bid Endymion nightly tend his sheep. Venus for those had rapt thee to the skies, But Mars on thee might look with Venus' eyes. O scarce a youth, yet scarce a tender boy! O useful time for lovers to employ! Pride of thy age, and glory of thy race, Come to these arms, and melt in this embrace! The vows you never will return, receive; And take at least the love you will not give. See, while I write, my words are lost in tears; The less my sense, the more my love appears. Sure 'twas not much to bid one kind adieu, (At least to feign was never hard to you) Farewel my Lesbian love, you might have said, Or coldly thus, farewel oh Lesbian maid! No tear did you, no parting kiss receive, Nor knew I then how much I was to grieve. No lover's gift your Sapho could confer, And wrongs and woes were all you left with her. No charge I gave you, and no charge could give, But this; be mindful of our loves, and live. Now by the Nine, those pow'rs ador'd by me, And Love, the God that ever waits on thee, When first I heard (from whom I hardly knew) That you were fled, and all my joys with you, Like some sad statue, speechless, pale, I stood, Grief chill'd my breast, and stop'd my freezing blood, No sigh to rise, no tear had pow'r to flow, Fix'd in a stupid lethargy of woe: But when its way th'impetuous passion found, I rend my tresses, and my breast I wound, I rave, then weep, I curse, and then complain, Now swell to rage, now melt in tears again. Not fiercer pangs distract the mournful dame, Whose first-born infant feeds the fun'ral flame. My scornful brother with a smile appears, Insults my woes, and triumphs in my tears, His hated image ever haunts my eyes, And why this grief? thy daughter lives, he cries. Stung with my love, and furious with despair, All torn my garments, and my bosom bare, My woes, thy crimes, I to the world proclaim; Such inconsistent things are love and shame! 'Tis thou art all my care and my delight, My daily longing, and my dream by night: Oh night more pleasing than the brightest day, When fancy gives what absence takes away, And dress'd in all its visionary charms, Restores my fair deserter to my arms! Then round your neck in wanton wreaths I twine, Then you, methinks, as fondly circle mine: A thousand tender words, I hear and speak; A thousand melting kisses, give, and take: Then fiercer joys—I blush to mention these, Yet while I blush, confess how much they please. But when, with day, the sweet delusions fly, And all things wake to life and joy, but I, As if once more forsaken, I complain, And close my eyes, to dream of you again: Then frantic rise, and like some Fury rove Thro' lonely plains, and thro' the silent grove, As if the silent grove, and lonely plains That knew my pleasures, could relieve my pains. I view the Grotto, once the scene of love, The rocks around, the hanging roofs above, That charm'd me more, with native moss o'ergrown, Than Phrygian marble, or the Parian stone. I find the shades that veil'd our joys before, But, Phaon gone, those shades delight no more. Here the press'd herbs with bending tops betray Where oft' entwin'd in am'rous folds we lay; I kiss that earth which once was press'd by you, And all with tears the with'ring herbs bedew. For thee the fading trees appear to mourn, And birds defer their songs till thy return: Night shades the groves, and all in silence lie, All, but the mournful Philomel and I: With mournful Philomel I join my strain, Of Tereus she, of Phaon I complain. A spring there is, whose silver waters show Clear as a glass, the shining sands below; A flow'ry Lotos spreads its arms above, Shades all the banks, and seems itself a grove; Eternal greens the mossy margin grace, Watch'd by the sylvan Genius of the place. Here as I lay, and swell'd with tears the flood, Before my sight a wat'ry Virgin stood, She stood and cry'd, “O you that love in vain! “Fly hence, and seek the fair Leucadian main; “There stands a rock from whose impending steep “Apollo's fane surveys the rolling deep; “There injur'd lovers leaping from above, “Their flames extinguish, and forget to love. “Deucalion once with hopeless fury burn'd, “In vain he lov'd, relentless Pyrrha scorn'd; “But when from hence he plung'd into the main, “Deucalion scorn'd, and Pyrrha lov'd in vain. “Haste Sapho, haste, from high Leucadia throw “Thy wretched weight, nor dread the deeps below! She spoke, and vanish'd with the voice—I rise, And silent tears fall trickling from my eyes. I go, ye Nymphs! those rocks and seas to prove; How much I fear, but ah, how much I love! I go, ye nymphs! where furious love inspires; Let female fears submit to female fires. To rocks and seas I fly from Phaon's hate, And hope from seas and rocks a milder fate. Ye gentle gales, beneath my body blow, And softly lay me on the waves below! And thou, kind Love, my sinking limbs sustain, Spread thy soft wings, and waft me o'er the main, Nor let a Lover's death the guiltless flood profane! On Phœbus' shrine my harp I'll then bestow, And this inscription shall be plac'd below. “Here she who sung, to him that did inspire, “Sapho to Phœbus consecrates her Lyre; “What suits with Sapho, Phœbus, suits with thee; “The gift, the giver, and the God agree. But why, alas, relentless youth, ah why To distant seas must tender Sapho fly? Thy charms than those may far more pow'rful be, And Phœbus' self is less a God to me. Ah! can'st thou doom me to the rocks and sea, O far more faithless and more hard than they? Ah! can'st thou rather see this tender breast Dash'd on those rocks, than to thy bosom prest? This breast which once, in vain! you lik'd so well; Where the Loves play'd, and where the Muses dwell. Alas! the Muses now no more inspire, Untun'd my lute, and silent is my lyre, My languid numbers have forgot to flow, And fancy sinks beneath a weight of woe. Ye Lesbian virgins, and ye Lesbian dames, Themes of my verse, and objects of my flames, No more your groves with my glad songs shall ring, No more these hands shall touch the trembling string: My Phaon's fled, and I those arts resign, (Wretch that I am, to call that Phaon mine!) Return, fair youth, return, and bring along Joy to my soul, and vigour to my song: Absent from thee, the Poet's flame expires, But ah! how fiercely burn the Lover's fires? Gods! can no pray'rs, no sighs, no numbers move One savage heart, or teach it how to love? The winds my pray'rs, my sighs, my numbers bear, The flying winds have lost them all in air! Oh when, alas! shall more auspicious gales To these fond eyes restore thy welcome sails? If you return—ah why these long delays? Poor Sapho dies, while careless Phaon stays. O launch thy bark, nor fear the watry plain; Venus for thee shall smooth her native main. O launch thy bark, secure of prosp'rous gales; Cupid for thee shall spread the swelling sails. If you will fly—(yet ah! what cause can be, Too cruel youth, that you should fly from me?) If not from Phaon I must hope for ease, Ah let me seek it from the raging seas: To raging seas unpity'd I'll remove, And either cease to live, or cease to love! VERTUMNUS AND POMONA: From the Fourteenth Book of Ovid's Metamorphoses. The fair Pomona flourish'd in his reign; Of all the Virgins of the sylvan train, None taught the trees a nobler race to bear, Or more improv'd the vegetable care. To her the shady grove, the flow'ry field, The streams and fountains, no delights could yield; 'Twas all her joy the ripening fruits to tend, And see the boughs with happy burthens bend. The hook she bore, instead of Cynthia's spear, To lop the growth of the luxuriant year, To decent form the lawless shoots to bring, And teach th'obedient branches where to spring. Now the cleft rind inserted graffs receives, And yields an offspring more than nature gives; Now sliding streams the thirsty plants renew, And feed their fibres with reviving dew. These cares alone her virgin breast employ, Averse from Venus and the nuptial joy. Her private orchards, wall'd on ev'ry side, To lawless sylvans all access deny'd. How oft' the Satyrs and the wanton Fawns, Who haunt the forests, or frequent the lawns, The God whose ensign scares the birds of prey, And old Silenus, youthful in decay, Employ'd their wiles, and unavailing care, To pass the fences, and surprize the fair? Like these, Vertumnus own'd his faithful flame, Like these, rejected by the scornful dame. To gain her sight, a thousand forms he wears, And first a reaper from the field appears, Sweating he walks, while loads of golden grain O'ercharge the shoulders of the seeming swain. Oft o'er his back a crooked scythe is laid, And wreaths of hay his sun-burnt temples shade: Oft' in his harden'd hand a goad he bears, Like one who late unyok'd the sweating steers. Sometimes his pruning-hook corrects the vines, And the loose straglers to their ranks confines. Now gath'ring what the bounteous year allows, He pulls ripe apples from the bending boughs. A soldier now, he with his sword appears; A fisher next, his trembling angle bears; Each shape he varies, and each art he tries, On her bright charms to feast his longing eyes. A female form at last Vertumnus wears, With all the marks of rev'rend age appears, His temples thinly spread with silver hairs; Prop'd on his staff, and stooping as he goes, A painted mitre shades his furrow'd brows. The God, in this decrepit form array'd, The gardens enter'd, and the fruits survey'd, And “Happy you! (he thus address'd the maid) “Whose charms as far all other nymphs out-shine, “As other gardens are excell'd by thine! Then kiss'd the fair; (his kisses warmer grow Than such as women on their sex bestow.) Then plac'd beside her on the flow'ry ground, Beheld the trees with autumn's bounty crown'd. An Elm was near, to whose embraces led, The curling vine her swelling clusters spread: He view'd their twining branches with delight, And prais'd the beauty of the pleasing sight. Yet this tall elm, but for his vine (he said) Had stood neglected, and a barren shade; And this fair vine, but that her arms surround Her marry'd elm, had crept along the ground. Ah beauteous maid, let this example move Your mind, averse from all the joys of love. Deign to be lov'd, and ev'ry heart subdue! What nymph cou'd e'er attract such crouds as you? Not she whose beauty urg'd the Centaurs arms, Ulysses' Queen, nor Helen's fatal charms. Ev'n now, when silent scorn is all they gain, A thousand court you, tho' they court in vain, A thousand sylvans, demigods, and gods, That haunt our mountains and our Alban woods. But if you'll prosper, mark what I advise, Whom age, and long experience render wise, And one whose tender care is far above All that these lovers ever felt of love, (Far more than e'er can by your self be guest) Fix on Vertumnus, and reject the rest. For his firm faith I dare engage my own; Scarce to himself, himself is better known. To distant lands Vertumnus never roves; Like you, contented with his native groves; Nor at first sight, like most, admires the fair; For you he lives; and you alone shall share His last affection, as his early care. Besides, he's lovely far above the rest, With youth immortal, and with beauty blest. Add, that he varies ev'ry shape with ease, And tries all forms that may Pomona please. But what should most excite a mutual flame, Your rural cares, and pleasures, are the same: To him your orchards early fruits are due, (A pleasing off'ring when 'tis made by you) He values these; but yet (alas) complains, That still the best and dearest gift remains. Not the fair fruit that on yon' branches glows With that ripe red th'autumnal sun bestows; Nor tasteful herbs that in these gardens rise, Which the kind soil with milky sap supplies; You, only you, can move the God's desire: Oh crown so constant and so pure a fire! Let soft compassion touch your gentle mind; Think, 'tis Vertumnus begs you to be kind! So may no frost, when early buds appear, Destroy the promise of the youthful year; Nor winds, when first your florid orchard blows, Shake the light blossoms from their blasted boughs! This when the various God had urg'd in vain, He strait assum'd his native form again; Such, and so bright an aspect now he bears, As when thro' clouds th'emerging sun appears, And thence exerting his refulgent ray, Dispels the darkness, and reveals the day. Force he prepar'd, but check'd the rash design; For when, appearing in a form divine, The Nymph surveys him, and beholds the grace Of charming features, and a youthful face; In her soft breast consenting passions move, And the warm maid confess'd a mutual love. THE FABLE OF DRYOPE: From the Ninth Book of Ovid's Metamorphoses. Upon occasion of the death of Hercules, his mother Alemena recounts her misfortunes to Iole, who answers with a relation of those of her own family, in particular the transformation of her sister Dryope, which is the subject of the ensuing Fable. She said, and for her lost Galanthis sighs, When the fair Consort of her son replies. Since you a servant's ravish'd form bemoan, And kindly sigh for sorrows not your own; Let me (if tears and grief permit) relate A nearer woe, a Sister's stranger fate. No Nymph of all Oechalia could compare For beauteous form with Dryope the fair, Her tender mother's only hope and pride, (My self the offspring of a second bride.) This Nymph compress'd by him who rules the day, Whom Delphi and the Delian isle obey, Andræmon lov'd; and bless'd in all those charms That pleas'd a God, succeeded to her arms. A lake there was, with shelving banks around, Whose verdant summit fragrant myrtles crown'd. These shades, unknowing of the fates, she sought, And to the Naiads flow'ry garlands brought; Her smiling babe (a pleasing charge) she prest Within her arms, and nourish'd at her breast. Not distant far, a watry Lotos grows, The spring was new, and all the verdant boughs Adorn'd with blossoms promis'd fruits that vie In glowing colours with the Tyrian dye: Of these she crop'd, to please her infant son, And I my self the same rash act had done: But lo! I saw, (as near her side I stood) The violated blossoms drop with blood; Upon the tree I cast a frightful look; The trembling tree with sudden horror shook. Lotis the nymph (if rural tales be true) As from Priapus' lawless lust she flew, Forsook her form; and fixing here became A flow'ry plant, which still preserves her name. This change unknown, astonish'd at the sight My trembling sister strove to urge her flight, And first the pardon of the nymphs implor'd, And those offended sylvan pow'rs ador'd: But when she backward wou'd have fled, she found Her stiff'ning feet were rooted in the ground: In vain to free her fasten'd feet she strove, And as she struggles, only moves above; She feels th'encroaching bark around her grow By quick degrees, and cover all below: Surpriz'd at this, her trembling hand she heaves To rend her hair; her hand is fill'd with leaves; Where late was hair, the shooting leaves are seen To rise, and shade her with a sudden green. The child Amphisus, to her bosom prest, Perceiv'd a colder and a harder breast, And found the springs that ne'er till then deny'd Their milky moisture, on a sudden dry'd. I saw, unhappy! what I now relate, And stood the helpless witness of thy fate, Embrac'd thy boughs, the rising bark delay'd, There wish'd to grow, and mingle shade with shade. Behold Andræmon and th'unhappy Sire Appear, and for their Dryope enquire; A springing tree for Dryope they find, A print warm kisses on the panting rind, Prostrate, with tears their kindred plant bedew, And close embrace, as to the roots they grew. The face was all that now remain'd of thee, No more a woman, nor yet quite a tree; Thy branches hung with humid pearls appear, From ev'ry leaf distills a trickling tear, And strait a voice, while yet a voice remains, Thus thro' the trembling boughs in sighs complains. If to the wretched any faith be giv'n, I swear by all th'unpitying pow'rs of heav'n, No wilful crime this heavy vengeance bred; In mutual innocence our lives we led: If this be false, let these new greens decay, Let sounding axes lop my limbs away, And crackling flames on all my honours prey. But from my branching arms this infant bear, Let some kind nurse supply a mother's care: And to his mother let him oft' be led, Sport in her shades, and in her shades be fed; Teach him, when first his infant voice shall frame Imperfect words, and lisp his mother's name, To hail this tree; and say, with weeping eyes, Within this plant my hapless parent lies: And when in youth he seeks the shady woods, Oh, let him fly the crystal lakes and floods, Nor touch the fatal flow'rs; but, warn'd by me, Believe a Goddess shrin'd in ev'ry tree. My sire, my sister, and my spouse farewell! If in your breasts or love or pity dwell, Protect your plant, nor let my branches feel The browzing cattel or the piercing steel. Farewell! and since I cannot bend to join My lips to yours, advance at least to mine. My son, thy mother's parting kiss receive, While yet thy mother has a kiss to give. I can no more; the creeping rind invades My closing lips, and hides my head in shades: Remove your hands, the bark shall soon suffice Without their aid to seal these dying eyes. She ceas'd at once to speak, and ceas'd to be; And all the nymph was lost within the Tree: Yet latent life thro' her new branches reign'd, And long the plant a human heat retain'd. THE FIRST BOOK OF STATIUS HIS THEBAIS. Translated in the Year 1703. ARGUMENT. Oedipus King of Thebes having by mistake slain his father Laius, and marry'd his mother Jocasta, put out his own eyes, and resign'd the realm to his sons Etheocles and Polynices. Being neglected by them, he makes his prayer to the fury Tisiphone, to sow debate betwixt the brothers. They agree at last to reign singly, each a year by turns, and the first lot is obtain'd by Etheocles. Jupiter, in a council of the Gods, declares his resolution of punishing the Thebans, and Argives also, by means of a marriage betwixt Polynices and one of the daughters of Adrastus King of Argos. Juno opposes, but to no effect; and Mercury is sent on a message to the shades, to the ghost of Laius, who is to appear to Etheocles, and provoke him to break the agreement. Polynices in the mean time departs from Thebes by night, is overtaken by a storm, and arrives at Argos; where he meets with Tydeus, who had fled from Calydon, having kill'd his brother. Adrastus entertains them, having receiv'd an oracle from Apollo that his daughters should be marry'd to a Boar and a Lion, which he understands to be meant of these strangers by whom the hides of those beasts were worn, and who arriv'd at the time when he kept an annual feast in honour of that God. The rise of this solemnity he relates to his guests, the loves of Phœbus and Psamathe, and the story of Choræbus. He enquires, and is made acquainted with their descent and quality: The sacrifice is renew'd, and the book concludes with a Hymn to Apollo. The Translator hopes he needs not apologize for his Choice of this piece, which was made almost in his Childhood. But finding the Version better than he expected, he gave it some Correction a few years afterwards. Fraternal Rage, the guilty Thebes alarms, Th'alternate reign destroy'd by impious arms, Demand our song; a sacred fury fires My ravish'd breast, and all the Muse inspires. O Goddess, say, shall I deduce my rhimes From the dire nation in its early times, Europa's rape, Agenor's stern decree, And Cadmus searching round the spacious sea? How with the serpent's teeth he sow'd the soil, And reap'd an Iron harvest of his toil? Or how from joining stones the city sprung, While to his harp divine Amphion sung? Or shall I Juno's hate to Thebes resound, Whose fatal rage th'unhappy Monarch found; The sire against the son his arrows drew, O'er the wide fields the furious mother flew, And while her arms her second hope contain, Sprung from the rocks and plung'd into the main. But wave whate'er to Cadmus may belong, And fix, O Muse! the barrier of thy song At Oedipus—from his disasters trace The long confusions of his guilty race. Nor yet attempt to stretch thy bolder wing, And mighty Cæsar's conqu'ring eagles sing; How twice he tam'd proud Ister's rapid flood, While Dacian mountains stream'd with barb'rous blood, Twice taught the Rhine beneath his laws to roll, And stretch'd his empire to the frozen Pole, Or long before, with early valour strove In youthful arms t'assert the cause of Jove. And Thou, great Heir of all thy father's fame, Encrease of glory to the Latian name! Oh bless thy Rome with an eternal reign, Nor let desiring worlds intreat in vain. What tho' the stars contract their heav'nly space, And croud their shining ranks to yield thee place; Tho' all the skies, ambitious of thy sway, Conspire to court thee from our world away; Tho' Phœbus longs to mix his rays with thine, And in thy glories more serenely shine; Tho' Jove himself no less content would be, To part his throne and share his heav'n with thee; Yet stay, great Cæsar! and vouchsafe to reign O'er the wide earth, and o'er the watry main; Resign to Jove his empire of the skies, And people heav'n with Roman Deities. The time will come, when a diviner flame Shall warm my breast to sing of Cæsar's fame: Meanwhile permit, that my preluding Muse In Theban wars an humbler theme may chuse: Of furious hate surviving death, she sings, A fatal throne to two contending Kings, A fun'ral flames, that parting wide in air Express the discord of the souls they bear: Of towns dispeopled, and the wand'ring ghosts Of Kings unbury'd on the wasted coasts; When Dirce's fountain blush'd with Grecian blood, And Thetis, near Ismenos' swelling flood, With dread beheld the rolling surges sweep In heaps, his slaughter'd sons into the deep. What Hero, Clio! wilt thou first relate? The Rage of Tydeus, or the Prophet's fate? Or how with hills of slain on ev'ry side, Hippomedon repell'd the hostile tyde? Or how the Parthenopæus. Youth with ev'ry grace adorn'd, Untimely fell, to be for ever mourn'd? Then to fierce Capaneus thy verse extend, And sing, with horror, his prodigious end. Now wretched Oedipus, depriv'd of sight, Led a long death in everlasting night; But while he dwells where not a chearful ray Can pierce the darkness, and abhors the day; The clear, reflecting mind, presents his sin In frightful views, and makes it day within; Returning thoughts in endless circles roll, And thousand furies haunt his guilty soul. The wretch then lifted to th'unpitying skies Those empty orbs from whence he tore his eyes, Whose wounds yet fresh, with bloody hands he strook, While from his breast these dreadful accents broke. Ye Gods that o'er the gloomy regions reign Where guilty spirits feel eternal pain; Thou, sable Styx! whose livid streams are roll'd Thro' dreary coasts, which I tho' blind behold: Tisiphone, that oft' hast heard my pray'r, Assist, if Oedipus deserve thy care! If you receiv'd me from Jocasta's womb, And nurs'd the hope of mischiefs yet to come: If leaving Polybus, I took my way To Cyrrha's temple, on that fatal day, When by the son the trembling father dy'd, Where the three roads the Phocian fields divide: If I the Sphynx's riddles durst explain, Taught by thy self to win the promis'd reign: If wretched I, by baleful furies led, With monstrous mixture stain'd my mother's bed, For hell and thee begot an impious brood, And with full lust those horrid joys renew'd: Then self-condemn'd to shades of endless night, Forc'd from these orbs the bleeding balls of sight. Oh hear, and aid the vengeance I require, If worthy thee, and what thou might'st inspire! My sons their old, unhappy sire despise, Spoil'd of his kingdom, and depriv'd of eyes; Guideless I wander, unregarded mourn, While these exalt their sceptres o'er my urn, These sons, ye Gods! who with flagitious pride, Insult my darkness, and my groans deride. Art thou a Father, unregarding Jove! And sleeps thy thunder in the realms above? Thou Fury, then, some lasting curse entail, Which o'er their childrens children shall prevail: Place on their heads that crown distain'd with gore, Which these dire hands from my slain father tore; Go, and a parent's heavy curses bear; Break all the bonds of nature, and prepare Their kindred souls to mutual hate and war. Give them to dare, what I might wish to see Blind as I am, some glorious villany! Soon shalt thou find, if thou but arm their hands, Their ready guilt preventing thy commands: Could'st thou some great, proportion'd mischief frame, They'd prove the father from whose loins they came. The Fury heard, while on Cacytus' brink Her snakes unty'd, sulphureous waters drink; But at the summons, roll'd her eyes around, And snatch'd the starting serpents from the ground. Not half so swiftly shoots along in air, The gliding light'ning, or descending star. Thro' crouds of airy shades she wing'd her flight, And dark dominions of the silent night; Swift as she pass'd, the flitting ghosts withdrew, And the pale spectres trembled at her view: To th'iron gates of Tenarus she flies, There spreads her dusky pinions to the skies. The day beheld, and sickning at the sight, Veil'd her fair glories in the shades of night. Affrighted Atlas, on the distant shore, Trembl'd, and shook the heav'ns and gods he bore. Now from beneath Malea's airy height Aloft she sprung, and steer'd to Thebes her flight; With eager speed the well-known journey took, Nor here regrets the hell she late forsook. A hundred snakes her gloomy visage shade, A hundred serpents guard her horrid head, In her sunk eye-balls dreadful meteors glow, Such rays from Phœbe's bloody circle flow, When lab'ring with strong charms, she shoots from high A fiery gleam, and reddens all the sky. Blood stain'd her cheeks, and from her mouth there came Blue steaming poisons, and a length of flame; From ev'ry blast of her contagious breath, Famine and drought proceed, and plagues, and death: A robe obscene was o'er her shoulders thrown, A dress by Fates and Furies worn alone: She toss'd her meagre arms; her better hand In waving circles whirl'd a fun'ral brand; A serpent from her left was seen to rear His flaming crest, and lash the yielding air. But when the Fury took her stand on high, Where vast Cythæron's top salutes the sky, A hiss from all the snaky tire went round: The dreadful signal all the rocks rebound, And thro' th'Achaian cities send the sound. Oete, with high Parnassus, heard the voice; Eurota's banks remurmur'd to the noise; Again Leucothoë shook at these alarms, And press'd Palæmon closer in her arms. Headlong from thence the glowing Fury springs, And o'er the Theban palace spreads her wings, Once more invades the guilty dome, and shrouds Its bright pavilions in a veil of clouds. Strait with the Gentilisque animos fubit furor, seems to me a better reading than gentilesque. rage of all their race possess'd, Stung to the soul, the brothers start from rest, And all the furies wake within their breast. Their tortur'd minds repining Envy tears, And Hate, engender'd by suspicious fears; And sacred Thirst of sway; and all the ties Of Nature broke; and royal Perjuries; And impotent Desire to reign alone, That scorns the dull reversion of a throne; Each would the sweets of sovereign rule devour, While Discord waits upon divided pow'r. As stubborn steers by brawny plowmen broke, And join'd reluctant to the galling yoke, Alike disdain with servile necks to bear Th'unwonted weight, or drag the crooked share, But rend the reins, and bound a diff'rent way, And all the furrows in confusion lay: Such was the discord of the royal pair, Whom fury drove precipitate to war. In vain the chiefs contriv'd a specious way, To govern Thebes by their alternate sway; Unjust decree! while this enjoys the state, That mourns in exile his unequal fate, And the short monarch of a hasty year Foresees with anguish his returning heir. Thus did the league their impious arms restrain, But scarce subsisted to the second reign. Yet then, no proud aspiring piles were rais'd, No fretted roofs with polish'd metals blaz'd, No labour'd columns in long order plac'd, No Grecian stone the pompous arches grac'd; No nightly bands in glitt'ring armour wait Before the sleepless Tyrant's guarded gate: No chargers then were wrought in burnish'd gold, Nor silver vases took the forming mold, Nor gems on bowls emboss'd were seen to shine, Blaze on the brims, and sparkle in the wine— Say, wretched rivals! what provokes your rage? Say to what end your impious arms engage? Not all bright Phœbus views in early morn, Or when his evening beams the west adorn, When the south glows with his meridian ray, And the cold north receives a fainter day; For crimes like these, not all those realms suffice, Were all those realms the guilty victor's prize! But fortune now (the lots of empire thrown) Decrees to proud Etheocles the crown: What joys, oh Tyrant! swell'd thy soul that day, When all were slaves thou could'st around survey, Pleas'd to behold unbounded pow'r thy own, And singly fill a fear'd and envy'd throne! But the vile Vulgar, ever discontent, Their growing fears in secret murmurs vent; Still prone to change, tho' still the slaves of state, And sure the monarch whom they have, to hate; New lords they madly make, then tamely bear, And softly curse the Tyrants whom they fear. And one of those who groan beneath the sway Of Kings impos'd, and grudgingly obey, (Whom envy to the great, and vulgar spight With scandal arm'd, th'ignoble mind's delight,) Exclaim'd—O Thebes! for thee what fates remain, What woes attend this inauspicious reign? Must we, alas! our doubtful necks prepare, Each haughty master's yoke by turns to bear, And still to change whom chang'd we still must fear? These now controul a wretched people's fate, These can divide, and these reverse the state: Ev'n Fortune rules no more:—O servile land, Where exil'd tyrants still by turns command! Thou Sire of Gods and men, imperial Jove! Is this th'eternal doom decreed above? On thy own offspring hast thou fix'd this fate, From the first birth of our unhappy state; When banish'd Cadmus wand'ring o'er the main, For lost Europa search'd the world in vain, And fated in Bœotian fields to found A rising empire on a foreign ground, First rais'd our walls on that ill-omen'd plain, Where earth-born brothers were by brothers slain? What lofty looks th'unrival'd monarch bears! How all the tyrant in his face appears! What sullen fury clouds his scornful brow! Gods! how his eyes with threatning ardour glow! Can this imperious lord forget to reign, Quit all his state, descend, and serve again? Yet, who, before, more popularly bow'd, Who more propitious to the suppliant croud, Patient of right, familiar in the throne? What wonder then? he was not then alone. Oh wretched we, a vile, submissive train, Fortune's tame fools, and slaves in ev'ry reign! As when two winds with rival force contend, This way and that, the wav'ring sails they bend, While freezing Boreas and black Eurus blow, Now here, now there, the reeling vessel throw: Thus on each side, alas! our tott'ring state Feels all the fury of resistless fate, And doubtful still, and still distracted stands, While that Prince threatens, and while this commands. And now th'almighty Father of the Gods Convenes a council in the blest abodes: Far in the bright recesses of the skies, High o'er the rowling heav'ns, a mansion lies, Whence, far below, the Gods at once survey The realms of rising and declining day, And all th'extended space of earth, and air, and sea. Full in the midst, and on a starry throne, The Majesty of heav'n superior shone; Serene he look'd, and gave an awful Placido quatiens tamen omnia vultu, is the common reading; I believe it should be nutu, with reference to the word quatiens. nod. And all the trembling spheres confess'd the God. At Jove's assent, the deities around In solemn state the consistory crown'd: Next a long order of inferior pow'rs Ascend from hills, and plains, and shady bow'rs; Those from whose urns the rowling rivers flow; And those that give the wand'ring winds to blow; Here all their rage, and ev'n their murmurs cease, And sacred silence reigns, and universal peace. A shining synod of majestic Gods Gilds with new lustre the divine abodes, Heav'n seems improv'd with a superior ray, And the bright arch reflects a double day. The Monarch then his solemn silence broke, The still creation listen'd while he spoke, Each sacred accent bears eternal weight, And each irrevocable word is Fate. How long shall man the wrath of heav'n defy, And force unwilling vengeance from the sky! Oh race confed'rate into crimes, that prove Triumphant o'er th'eluded rage of Jove! This weary'd arm can scarce the bolt sustain, And unregarded thunder rolls in vain: Th'o'erlabour'd Cyclop from his task retires; Th'Æolian forge exhausted of its fires. For this, I suffer'd Phœbus' steeds to stray, And the mad ruler to misguide the day, When the wide earth to heaps of ashes turn'd, And heav'n itself the wand'ring chariot burn'd. For this, my brother of the wat'ry reign Releas'd th'impetuous sluices of the main: But flames consum'd, and billows rag'd in vain. Two races now, ally'd to Jove, offend; To punish these, see Jove himself descend! The Theban Kings their line from Cadmus trace, From godlike Perseus those of Argive race. Unhappy Cadmus' fate who does not know? And the long series of succeeding woe: How oft' the Furies, from the deeps of night, Arose, and mix'd with men in mortal fight: Th'exulting mother, stain'd with filial blood; The savage hunter, and the haunted wood; The direful banquet why should I proclaim, And crimes that grieve the trembling Gods to name? E'er I recount the sins of these profane, The sun would sink into the western main, And rising gild the radiant east again. Have we not seen (the blood of Laius shed) The murd'ring son ascend his parent's bed, Thro' violated nature force his way, And stain the sacred womb where once he lay? Yet now in darkness and despair he groans, And for the crimes of guilty fate attones; His sons with scorn their eyeless father view, Insult his wounds, and make them bleed anew. Thy curse, oh Oedipus, just heav'n alarms, And sets th'avenging thunderer in arms. I from the root thy guilty race will tear, And give the nations to the waste of war. Adrastus soon, with Gods averse, shall join, In dire alliance with the Theban line; Hence strife shall rise, and mortal war succeed; The guilty realms of Tantalus shall bleed; Fix'd is their doom; this all-remembring breast Yet harbours vengeance for the tyrant's feast. He said; and thus the Queen of heav'n return'd; (With sudden grief her lab'ring bosom burn'd) Must I whose cares Phoroneus' tow'rs defend, Must I, oh Jove, in bloody wars contend? Thou know'st those regions my protection claim, Glorious in arms, in riches, and in fame: Tho' there the fair Ægyptian heifer fed, And there deluded Argus slept, and bled; Tho' there the braz'n tow'r was storm'd of old, When Jove descended in almighty gold. Yet I can pardon those obscurer rapes, Those bashful crimes disguis'd in borrow'd shapes; But Thebes, where shining in cœlestial charms: Thou cam'st triumphant to a mortal's arms, When all my glories o'er her limbs were spread, And blazing light'nings danc'd around her bed; Curs'd Thebes the vengeance it deserves, may prove— Ah why shou'd Argos feel the rage of Jove? Yet since thou wilt thy sister-Queen controul, Since still the lust of discord fires thy soul, Go, rase my Samos, let Mycenè fall, And level with the dust the Spartan wall; No more let mortals Juno's pow'r invoke, Her fanes no more with eastern incense smoke, Nor victims sink beneath the sacred stroke; But to your Isis all my rites transfer, Let altars blaze and temples smoke for her; For her, thro' Ægypt's fruitful clime renown'd, Let weeping Nilus hear the timbrel sound. But if thou must reform the stubborn times, Avenging on the sons the father's crimes, And from the long records of distant age Derive incitements to renew thy rage; Say, from what period then has Jove design'd To date his vengeance; to what bounds confin'd? Begin from thence, where first Alphëus hides His wand'ring stream, and thro' the briny tides Unmix'd, to his Sicilian river glides. Thy own Arcadians there the thunder claim, Whose impious rites disgrace thy mighty name; Who raise thy temples where the chariot stood Of fierce Oenomäus, defil'd with blood; Where once his steeds their savage banquet found, And human bones yet whiten all the ground. Say, can those honours please? and can'st thou love Presumptuous Crete, that boasts the tomb of Jove? And shall not Tantalus his kingdoms share Thy wife and sister's tutelary care? Reverse, O Jove, thy too severe decree, Nor doom to war a race deriv'd from thee; On impious realms, and barb'rous Kings, impose Thy plagues, and curse 'em with such Etheocles and Polynices. Sons as those. Thus, in reproach and pray'r, the Queen express'd The rage and grief contending in her breast; Unmov'd remain'd the ruler of the sky, And from his throne return'd this stern reply. 'Twas thus I deem'd thy haughty soul would bear The dire, tho' just, revenge which I prepare Against a nation thy peculiar care: No less Dione might for Thebes contend, Nor Bacchus less his native town defend, Yet these in silence see the fates fulfil Their work, and reverence our superior will. For by the black infernal Styx I swear, (That dreadful oath which binds the Thunderer) 'Tis fix'd; th'irrevocable doom of Jove; No force can bend me, no persuasion move. Haste then, Cyllenius, thro' the liquid air; Go mount the winds, and to the shades repair; Bid hell's black monarch my commands obey, And give up Laius to the realms of day, Whose ghost yet shiv'ring on Cocytus' sand, Expects its passage to the farther strand: Let the pale sire revisit Thebes, and bear These pleasing orders to the tyrant's ear; That, from his exil'd brother, swell'd with pride Of foreign forces, and his Argive bride, Almighty Jove commands him to detain The promis'd empire, and alternate reign: Be this the cause of more than mortal hate; The rest, succeeding times shall ripen into Fate. The God obeys, and to his feet applies Those golden wings that cut the yielding skies; His ample hat his beamy locks o'erspread, And veil'd the starry glories of his head! He seiz'd the wand that causes sleep to fly, Or in soft slumbers seals the wakeful eye; That drives the dead to dark Tartarean coasts, Or back to life compels the wond'ring ghosts. Thus, thro' the parting clouds, the son of May Wings on the whistling winds his rapid way, Now smoothly steers thro' air his equal flight, Now springs aloft, and tow'rs th'ethereal height; Then wheeling down the steep of heav'n he flies, And draws a radiant circle o'er the skies. Meantime the banish'd Polynices roves (His Thebes abandon'd) thro' th'Aonian groves, While future realms his wand'ring thoughts delight, His daily vision and his dream by night; Forbidden Thebes appears before his eye, From whence he sees his absent brother fly, With transport views the airy rule his own, And swells on an imaginary throne. Fain would he cast a tedious age away, And live out all in one triumphant day. He chides the lazy progress of the sun, And bids the year with swifter motion run. With anxious hopes his craving mind is tost, And all his joys in length of wishes lost. The hero then resolves his course to bend Where ancient Danaus' fruitful fields extend, And fam'd Mycene's lofty tow'rs ascend, (Where late the sun did Atreus' crimes detest, And disappear'd in horror of the feast.) And now by chance, by fate, or furies led, From Bacchus' consecrated caves he fled, Where the shrill cries of frantic matrons sound, And Pentheus' blood enrich'd the rising ground. Then sees Cythæron tow'ring o'er the plain, And thence declining gently to the main. Next to the bounds of Nisus' realm repairs, Where treach'rous Scylla cut the purple hairs: The hanging cliffs of Scyron's rock explores, And hears the murmurs of the diff'rent shores: Passes the strait that parts the foaming seas, And stately Corinth's pleasing site surveys. 'Twas now the time when Phœbus yields to night, And rising Cynthia sheds her silver light, Wide o'er the world in solemn pomp she drew Her airy chariot hung with pearly dew; All birds and beasts lie hush'd; sleep steals away The wild desires of men, and toils of day, And brings, descending thro' the silent air, A sweet forgetfulness of human care. Yet no red clouds, with golden borders gay, Promise the skies the bright return of day; No faint reflections of the distant light Streak with long gleams the scatt'ring shades of night; From the damp earth impervious vapours rise, Encrease the darkness and involve the skies. At once the rushing winds with roaring sound Burst from th'Æolian caves, and rend the ground, With equal rage their airy quarrel try, And win by turns the kingdom of the sky: But with a thicker night black Auster shrouds The heav'ns, and drives on heaps the rolling clouds, From whose dark womb a ratling tempest pours, Which the cold north congeals to haily show'rs. From pole to pole the thunder roars aloud, And broken lightnings flash from ev'ry cloud. Now smoaks with show'rs the misty mountain-ground, And floated fields lie undistinguish'd round: Th'Inachian streams with headlong fury run, And Erasinus rolls a deluge on: The foaming Lerna swells above its bounds, And spreads its ancient poisons o'er the grounds: Where late was dust, now rapid torrents play, Rush thro' the mounds, and bear the damms away: Old limbs of trees from crackling forests torn, Are whirl'd in air, and on the winds are born; The storm the dark Lycæan groves display'd, And first to light expos'd the sacred shade. Th'intrepid Theban hears the bursting sky, Sees yawning rocks in massy fragments fly, And views astonish'd from the hills afar, The floods descending and the watry war, That driv'n by storms, and pouring o'er the plain, Swept herds, and hinds, and houses to the main. Thro' the brown horrors of the night he fled, Nor knows, amaz'd, what doubtful path to tread, His brother's image to his mind appears, Inflames his heart with rage, and wings his feet with fears. So fares a sailor on the stormy main, When clouds conceal Boötes' golden wain, When not a star its friendly lustre keeps, Nor trembling Cynthia glimmers on the deeps; He dreads the rocks, and shoals, and seas, and skies, While thunder roars, and light'ning round him flies. Thus strove the chief on ev'ry side distress'd, Thus still his courage, with his toils encreas'd; With his broad shield oppos'd, he forc'd his way Thro' thickest woods, and rouz'd the beasts of prey. Till he beheld, where from Larissa's height The shelving walls reflect a glancing light: Thither with haste the Theban hero flies; On this side Lerna's pois'nous water lies, On that, Prosymna's grove and temple rise: He pass'd the gates which then unguarded lay, And to the regal palace bent his way; On the cold marble spent with toil he lies, And waits till pleasing slumbers seal his eyes. Adrastus here his happy people sways, Bless'd with calm peace in his declining days, By both his parents of descent divine, Great Jove and Phœbus grac'd his noble line; Heav'n had not crown'd his wishes with a son, But two fair daughters heir'd his state and throne. To him Apollo (wondrous to relate! But who can pierce into the depths of fate?) Had sung—“Expect thy sons on Argos' shore, “A yellow lion and a bristly boar. This, long revolv'd in his paternal breast, Sate heavy on his heart, and broke his rest; This, great Amphiaraus, lay hid from thee, Tho' skill'd in fate, and dark futurity. The father's care and prophet's art were vain, For thus did the predicting God ordain. Lo hapless Tydeus, whose ill-fated hand Had slain his brother, leaves his native land, And seiz'd with horror, in the shades of night, Thro' the thick desarts headlong urg'd his flight: Now by the fury of the tempests driv'n, He seeks a shelter from th'inclement heav'n, Till led by fate, the Theban's steps he treads, And to fair Argos' open court succeeds. When thus the chiefs from diff'rent lands resort T'Adrastus' realms, and hospitable court; The King surveys his guests with curious eyes, And views their arms and habit with surprize. A lion's yellow skin the Theban wears, Horrid his mane, and rough with curling hairs; Such once employ'd Alcides' youthful toils, E'er yet adorn'd with Nemea's dreadful spoils. A boar's stiff hide, of Calydonian breed, Oenides' manly shoulders overspread, Oblique his tusks, erect his bristles stood, Alive, the pride and terror of the wood. Struck with the sight, and fix'd in deep amaze, The King th'accomplish'd Oracle surveys, Reveres Apollo's vocal caves, and owns The guiding Godhead, and his future sons. O'er all his bosom secret transports reign, And a glad horror shoots thro' ev'ry vein. To heav'n he lifts his hands, erects his sight, And thus invokes the silent Queen of night. Goddess of shades, beneath whose gloomy reign Yon' spangled arch glows with the starry train: You who the cares of heav'n and earth allay, Till nature quickned by th'inspiring ray Wakes to new vigour with the rising day. Oh thou who freest me from my doubtful state, Long lost and wilder'd in the maze of Fate! Be present still, oh Goddess! in our aid; Proceed, and firm those omens thou hast made. We to thy name our annual rites will pay, And on thy altars sacrifices lay; The sable flock shall fall beneath the stroke, And fill thy temples with a grateful smoke. Hail, faithful Tripos! hail, ye dark abodes Of awful Phœbus: I confess the Gods! Thus, seiz'd with sacred fear, the Monarch pray'd; Then to his inner court the guests convey'd; Where yet thin fumes from dying sparks arise, And dust yet white upon each altar lies, The relicks of a former sacrifice. The King once more the solemn rites requires, And bids renew the feasts, and wake the fires. His train obey, while all the courts around With noisy care and various tumult sound. Embroider'd purple clothes the golden beds; This slave the floor, and that the table spreads; A third dispels the darkness of the night, And fills depending lamps with beams of light; Here loaves in canisters are pile'd on high, And there, in flames the slaughter'd victims fry. Sublime in regal state, Adrastus shone, Stretch'd on rich carpets, on his iv'ry throne; A lofty couch receives each princely guest; Around, at awful distance, wait the rest. And now the King, his royal feast to grace, Acestis calls, the guardian of his race, Who first their youth in arts of virtue train'd, And their ripe years in modest grace maintain'd. Then softly whisper'd in her faithful ear, And bade his daughters at the rites appear. When from the close apartments of the night, The royal Nymphs approach divinely bright; Such was Diana's, such Minerva's face; Nor shine their beauties with superior grace, But that in these a milder charm endears, And less of terror in their looks appears. As on the heroes first they cast their eyes, O'er their fair cheeks the glowing blushes rise, Their down-cast looks a decent shame confess'd, Then, on their father's rev'rend features rest. The banquet done, the Monarch gives the sign, To fill the goblet high with sparkling wine, Which Danaus us'd in sacred rites of old, With sculpture grac'd, and rough with rising gold. Here to the clouds victorious Perseus flies; Medusa seems to move her languid eyes, And ev'n in gold, turns paler as she dies. There from the chace Jove's tow'ring eagle bears On golden wings, the Phrygian to the stars; Still as he rises in th'æthereal height, His native mountains lessen to his sight; While all his sad companions upward gaze, Fix'd on the glorious scene in wild amaze; And the swift hounds, affrighted as he flies, Run to the shade, and bark against the skies. This golden bowl with gen'rous juice was crown'd, The first libations sprinkled on the ground: By turns on each celestial pow'r they call; With Phœbus' name resounds the vaulted hall. The courtly train, the strangers, and the rest, Crown'd with chaste laurel, and with garlands dress'd, While with rich gums the fuming altars blaze Salute the God in num'rous hymns of praise. Then thus the King: Perhaps, my noble guests, These honour'd altars, and these annual feasts To bright Apollo's awful name design'd, Unknown, with wonder may perplex your mind. Great was the cause; our old solemnities From no blind zeal or fond tradition rise; But sav'd from death, our Argives yearly pay These grateful honours to the God of Day. When by a thousand darts the Python slain With orbs unroll'd lay covering all the plain, (Transfix'd as o'er Castalia's streams he hung, And suck'd new poisons with his triple tongue) To Argos' realms the Victor god resorts, And enters old Crotopus' humble courts. This rural prince one only daughter blest, That all the charms of blooming youth possess'd; Fair was her face, and spotless was her mind, Where filial love with virgin sweetness join'd. Happy! and happy still she might have prov'd, Were she less beautiful, or less belov'd! But Phœbus lov'd, and on the flow'ry side Of Nemea's stream, the yielding fair enjoy'd; Now, e'er ten moons their orb with light adorn, Th'illustrious offspring of the God was born. The Nymph, her father's anger to evade, Retires from Argos to the sylvan shade, To woods and wilds the pleasing burden bears, And trusts her infant to a shepherd's cares. How mean a fate, unhappy child! is thine? Ah how unworthy those of race divine? On flow'ry herbs in some green covert laid, His bed the ground, his canopy the shade, He mixes with the bleating lambs his cries, While the rude swain his rural music tries, To call soft slumbers on his infant eyes. Yet ev'n in those obscure abodes to live, Was more, alas! than cruel fate would give, For on the grassy verdure as he lay, And breath'd the freshness of the early day, Devouring dogs the helpless infant tore, Fed on his trembling limbs, and lapp'd the gore. Th'astonish'd mother, when the rumour came, Forgets her father, and neglects her fame, With loud complaints she fills the yielding air, And beats her breast, and rends her flowing hair; Then wild with anguish to her Sire she flies: Demands the sentence, and contented dies. But touch'd with sorrow for the dead, too late, The raging God prepares t'avenge her fate. He sends a monster, horrible and fell, Begot by furies in the depths of hell. The pest a virgin's face and bosom bears; High on her crown a rising snake appears, Guards her black front, and hisses in her hairs: About the realm she walks her dreadful round, When night with sable wings o'erspreads the ground, Devours young babes before their parents eyes, And feeds and thrives on publick miseries. But gen'rous rage the bold Chorœbus warms, Chorœbus, fam'd for virtue, as for arms; Some few like him, inspir'd with martial flame, Thought a short life well lost for endless fame. These, where two ways in equal parts divide, The direful monster from afar descry'd; Two bleeding babes depending at her side; Whose panting vitals, warm with life, she draws, And in their hearts embrues her cruel claws. The youth surround her with extended spears; But brave Chorœbus in the front appears, Deep in her breast he plung'd his shining sword, And hell's dire monster back to hell restor'd. Th'Inachians view the slain with vast surprize, Her twisting volumes, and her rolling eyes, Her spotted breast, and gaping womb embru'd With livid poison, and our childrens blood. The croud in stupid wonder fix'd appear, Pale ev'n in joy, nor yet forget to fear. Some with vast beams the squalid corps engage, And weary all the wild efforts of rage. The birds obscene, that nightly flock'd to taste, With hollow screeches fled the dire repast; And ravenous dogs, allur'd by scented blood, And starving wolves, ran howling to the wood. But fir'd with rage, from cleft Parnassus' brow Avenging Phœbus' bent his deadly bow, And hissing flew the feather'd fates below; A night of sultry clouds involv'd around The tow'rs, the fields, and the devoted ground: And now a thousand lives together fled, Death with his scythe cut off the fatal thread, And a whole province in his triumph led. But Phœbus, ask'd why noxious fires appear, And raging Sirius blasts the sickly year; Demands their lives by whom his monster fell, And dooms a dreadful sacrifice to hell. Bless'd be thy dust, and let eternal fame Attend thy Manes, and preserve thy name; Undaunted Hero! who, divinely brave, In such a cause disdain'd thy life to save; But view'd the shrine with a superior look, And its upbraided Godhead thus bespoke. With piety, the soul's securest guard, And conscious virtue, still its own reward, Willing I come, unknowing how to fear; Nor shalt thou, Phœbus, find a suppliant here. Thy monster's death to me was ow'd alone, And 'tis a deed too glorious to disown. Behold him here, for whom, so many days, Impervious clouds conceal'd thy sullen rays; For whom, as Man no longer claim'd thy care, Such numbers fell by pestilential air! But if th'abandon'd race of human kind From Gods above no more compassion find; If such inclemency in heav'n can dwell, Yet why must un-offending Argos feel The vengeance due to this unluckly steel? On me, on me, let all thy fury fall, Nor err from me, since I deserve it all: Unless our desart cities please thy sight, Our fun'ral flames reflect a grateful light. Discharge thy shafts, this ready bosom rend, And to the shades a ghost triumphant send; But for my Country let my fate atone, Be mine the vengeance, as the crime my own. Merit distress'd, impartial heav'n relieves; Unwelcome life relenting Phœbus gives; For not the vengeful pow'r, that glow'd with rage, With such amazing virtue durst engage. The clouds dispers'd, Apollo's wrath expir'd, And from the wondring God th'unwilling youth retir'd. Thence we these altars in his temple raise, And offer annual honours, feasts, and praise; These solemn feasts propitious Phœbus please, These honours, still renew'd, his antient wrath appease. But say, illustrious guest (adjoin'd the King) What name you bear, from what high race you spring? The noble Tydeus stands confess'd, and known Our neighbour Prince, and heir of Calydon. Relate your fortunes, while the friendly night And silent hours to various talk invite. The Theban bends on earth his gloomy eyes, Confus'd, and sadly thus at length replies: Before these altars how shall I proclaim (Oh gen'rous prince) my nation or my name, Or thro' what veins our antient blood has roll'd? Let the sad tale for ever rest untold! Yet if propitious to a wretch unknown, You seek to share in sorrows not your own; Know then, from Cadmus I derive my race, Jocasta's son, and Thebes my native place. To whom the King, (who felt his gen'rous breast Touch'd with concern for his unhappy guest) Replies—Ah why forbears the son to name His wretched father, known too well by fame? Fame, that delights around the world to stray, Scorns not to take our Argos in her way. Ev'n those who dwell where suns at distance roll, In northern wilds, and freeze beneath the pole; And those who tread the burning Libyan lands, The faithless Syrtes and the moving sands; Who view the western sea's extremest bounds, Or drink of Ganges in their eastern grounds; All these the woes of Oedipus have known, Your fates, your furies, and your haunted town. If on the sons the parents crimes descend, What Prince from those his lineage can defend? Be this thy comfort, that 'tis thine t'efface With virtuous acts thy ancestor's disgrace, And be thy self the honour of thy race. But see! the stars begin to steal away, And shine more faintly at approaching day; Now pour the wine; and in your tuneful lays, Once more resound the great Apollo's praise. Oh father Phœbus! whether Lycia's coast And snowy mountains, thy bright presence boast; Whether to sweet Castalia thou repair, And bathe in silver dews thy yellow hair; Or pleas'd to find fair Delos float no more, Delight in Cynthus, and the shady shore; Or chuse thy seat in Ilion's proud abodes, The shining structures rais'd by lab'ring Gods. By thee the bow and mortal shafts are born; Eternal charms thy blooming youth adorn: Skill'd in the laws of secret fate above, And the dark counsels of almighty Jove, 'Tis thine the seeds of future war to know, The change of scepters, and impending woe; When direful meteors spread thro' glowing air Long trails of light, and shake their blazing hair. Thy rage the Phrygian felt, who durst aspire T'excel the music of thy heav'nly lyre; Thy shafts aveng'd leud Tityus' guilty flame, Th'immortal victim of thy mother's fame; Thy hand slew Python, and the dame who lost Her num'rous off-spring for a fatal boast. In Phlegias' doom thy just revenge appears, Condemn'd to furies and eternal fears; He views his food, but dreads, with lifted eye, The mouldring rock that trembles from on high. Propitious hear our pray'r, O Pow'r divine! And on thy hospitable Argos shine. Whether the style of Titan please thee more, Whose purple rays th'Achæmenes adore; Or great Osyris, who first taught the swain In Pharian fields to sow the golden grain; Or Mitra, to whose beams the Persian bows, And pays, in hollow rocks, his awful vows; Mitra, whose head the blaze of light adorns, Who grasps the struggling heifer's lunar horns. JANUARY and MAY: OR, The Merchant's Tale. FROM CHAUCER. This Translation was done at sixteen or seventeen Years of Age. There liv'd in Lombardy, as authors write, In days of old, a wise and worthy Knight; Of gentle manners, as of gen'rous race, Bless'd with much sense, more riches, and some grace. Yet led astray by Venus' soft delights, He scarce could rule some idle appetites: For long ago, let Priests say what they cou'd, Weak sinful laymen were but flesh and blood. But in due time, when sixty years were o'er, He vow'd to lead this vicious life no more; Whether pure holiness inspir'd his mind, Or dotage turn'd his brain, is hard to find; But his high courage prick'd him forth to wed, And try the pleasures of a lawful bed. This was his nightly dream, his daily care, And to the heav'nly pow'rs his constant pray'r, Once, e'er he dy'd, to taste the blissful life Of a kind husband and a loving wife. These thoughts he fortify'd with reasons still, (For none want reasons to confirm their will.) Grave authors say, and witty poets sing, That honest wedlock is a glorious thing: But depth of judgment most in him appears, Who wisely weds in his maturer years. Then let him chuse a damsel young and fair, To bless his age, and bring a worthy heir; To sooth his cares, and free from noise and strife Conduct him gently to the verge of life. Let sinful batchelors their woes deplore, Full well they merit all they feel, and more: Unaw'd by precepts, human or divine, Like birds and beasts, promiscuously they join: Nor know to make the present blessing last, To hope the future, or esteem the past; But vainly boast the joys they never try'd, And find divulg'd the secrets they would hide. The marry'd man may bear his yoke with ease, Secure at once himself and heav'n to please; And pass his inoffensive hours away, In bliss all night, and innocence all day: Tho' fortune change, his constant spouse remains, Augments his joys, or mitigates his pains. But what so pure, which envious tongues will spare? Some wicked wits have libell'd all the fair. With matchless impudence they stile a wife The dear-bought curse, and lawful plague of life; A bosom-serpent, a domestic evil, A night-invasion, and a mid-day-devil. Let not the wise these sland'rous words regard, But curse the bones of ev'ry lying bard. All other goods by fortune's hand are giv'n, A Wife is the peculiar gift of heav'n: Vain fortune's favours, never at a stay, Like empty shadows, pass, and glide away; One solid comfort, our eternal wife, Abundantly supplies us all our life: This blessing lasts, (if those who try, say true) As long as heart can wish—and longer too. Our grandsire Adam, e'er of Eve possess'd, Alone, and ev'n in Paradise unbless'd, With mournful looks the blissful scenes survey'd, And wander'd in the solitary shade: The Maker saw, took pity, and bestow'd Woman, the last, the best reserve of God. A Wife! ah gentle deities, can he That has a wife, e'er feel adversity? Would men but follow what the sex advise, All things would prosper, all the world grow wise. 'Twas by Rebecca's aid that Jacob won His father's blessing from an elder son: Abusive Nabal ow'd his forfeit life To the wise conduct of a prudent wife: Heroic Judith, as old Hebrews show, Preserv'd the Jews, and slew th'Assyrian foe: At Hester's suit, the persecuting sword Was sheath'd, and Israel liv'd to bless the Lord. These weighty motives, January the sage Maturely ponder'd in his riper age; And charm'd with virtuous joys, and sober life, Would try that christian comfort, call'd a wife. His friends were summon'd on a point so nice, To pass their judgment, and to give advice; But fix'd before, and well resolv'd was he; (As men that ask advice are wont to be.) My friends, he cry'd, (and cast a mournful look Around the room, and sigh'd before he spoke:) Beneath the weight of threescore years I bend, And worn with cares, am hast'ning to my end; How I have liv'd, alas! you know too well, In worldly follies, which I blush to tell; But gracious heav'n has ope'd my eyes at last, With due regret I view my vices past, And as the precept of the Church decrees, Will take a wife, and live in holy ease. But since by counsel all things should be done, And many heads are wiser still than one; Chuse you for me, who best shall be content When my desire's approv'd by your consent. One caution yet is needful to be told, To guide your choice; this wife must not be old: There goes a saying, and 'twas shrewdly said, Old fish at table, but young flesh in bed. My soul abhors the tastless, dry embrace Of a stale virgin with a winter face; In that cold season Love but treats his guest With bean-straw, and tough forage at the best. No crafty widows shall approach my bed; Those are too wise for batchelors to wed; As subtle clerks by many schools are made, Twice-marry'd dames are mistresses o'th' trade: But young and tender virgins, rul'd with ease, We form like wax, and mold them as we please. Conceive me, Sirs, nor take my sense amiss; 'Tis what concerns my soul's eternal bliss; Since if I found no pleasure in my spouse, As flesh is frail, and who (God help me) knows? Then should I live in leud adultery, And sink downright to Satan when I die. Or were I curs'd with an unfruitful bed, The righteous end were lost, for which I wed; To raise up seed to bless the pow'rs above, And not for pleasure only, or for love. Think not I doat; 'tis time to take a wife, When vig'rous blood forbids a chaster life: Those that are blest with store of grace divine, May live like saints, by heav'ns consent, and mine. And since I speak of wedlock, let me say, (As, thank my stars, in modest truth I may) My limbs are active, still I'm sound at heart, And a new vigour springs in ev'ry part. Think not my virtue lost, tho' time has shed These rev'rend honours on my hoary head; Thus trees are crown'd with blossoms white as snow, The vital sap then rising from below: Old as I am, my lusty limbs appear Like winter greens, that flourish all the year. Now, Sirs, you know to what I stand inclin'd, Let ev'ry friend with freedom speak his mind. He said; the rest in diff'rent parts divide, The knotty point was urg'd on either side; Marriage, the theme on which they all declaim'd, Some prais'd with wit, and some with reason blam'd. Till, what with proofs, objections, and replies, Each wondrous positive, and wondrous wise, There fell between his brothers a debate, Placebo this was call'd, and Justin that. First to the Knight Placebo thus begun, (Mild were his looks, and pleasing was his tone) Such prudence, Sir, in all your words appears, As plainly proves, experience dwells with years! Yet you pursue sage Solomon's advice, To work by counsel when affairs are nice: But, with the Wiseman's leave, I must protest, So may my soul arrive at ease and rest, As still I hold your own advice the best. Sir, I have liv'd a Courtier all my days, And study'd men, their manners, and their ways; And have observ'd this useful maxim still, To let my betters always have their will. Nay, if my Lord affirm'd that black was white, My word was this, Your honour's in the right. Th'assuming Wit, who deems himself so wise As his mistaken patron to advise, Let him not dare to vent his dang'rous thought; A noble fool was never in a fault. This, Sir, affects not you, whose ev'ry word Is weigh'd with judgment, and befits a Lord: Your will is mine; and is (I will maintain) Pleasing to God, and should be so to Man; At least, your courage all the world must praise, Who dare to wed in your declining days. Indulge the vigour of your mounting blood, And let grey fools be indolently good, Who past all pleasure, damn the joys of sense, With rev'rend dulness, and grave impotence. Justin, who silent sate, and heard the man, Thus, with a philosophic frown, began. A heathen author, of the first degree, (Who, tho' not Faith, had Sense as well as we) Bids us be certain our concerns to trust To those of gen'rous principles, and just. The venture's greater, I'll presume to say, To give your person, than your goods away: And therefore, Sir, as you regard your rest, First learn your Lady's qualities at least: Whether she's chaste or rampant, proud or civil; Meek as a saint, or haughty as the devil; Whether an easy, fond, familiar fool, Or such a wit as no man e'er can rule? 'Tis true, perfection none must hope to find In all this world, much less in woman-kind; But if her virtues prove the larger share, Bless the kind fates, and think your fortune rare. Ah, gentle Sir, take warning of a friend, Who knows too well the state you thus commend; And, spight of all its praises, must declare, All he can find is bondage, cost, and care. Heav'n knows, I shed full many a private tear, And sigh in silence, lest the world should hear: While all my friends applaud my blissful life, And swear no mortal's happier in a wife; Demure and chaste as any vestal Nun, The meekest creature that beholds the sun! But, by the immortal pow'rs, I feel the pain, And he that smarts has reason to complain. Do what you list, for me; you must be sage, And cautious sure; for wisdom is in Age: But, at these years, to venture on the fair! By him, who made the ocean, earth, and air, To please a wife, when her occasions call, Would busy the most vig'rous of us all. And trust me, Sir, the chastest you can chuse Will ask observance, and exact her dues. If what I speak my noble Lord offend, My tedious sermon here is at an end. 'Tis well, 'tis wond'rous well, the Knight replies, Most worthy kinsman, faith you're mighty wise! We, Sirs, are fools; and must resign the cause To heath'nish authors, proverbs, and old saws. He spoke with scorn, and turn'd another way;— What does my friend, my dear Placebo say? I say, quoth he, by heav'n the man's to blame, To slander wives, and wedlock's holy name. At this, the council rose, without delay; Each, in his own opinion, went his way; With full consent, that all disputes appeas'd, The Knight should marry, when and where he pleas'd. Who now but January exults with joy? The charms of wedlock all his soul employ: Each nymph by turns his wav'ring mind possest, And reign'd the short-liv'd tyrant of his breast; While fancy pictur'd ev'ry lively part, And each bright image wander'd o'er his heart. Thus, in some publick Forum fix'd on high, A Mirrour shows the figures moving by; Still one by one, in swift succession, pass The gliding shadows o'er the polish'd glass. This Lady's charms the nicest cou'd not blame, But vile suspicions had aspers'd her fame; That was with sense, but not with virtue, blest; And one had grace, that wanted all the rest. Thus doubting long what nymph he shou'd obey, He fix'd at last upon the youthful May. Her faults he knew not, Love is always blind, But ev'ry charm revolv'd within his mind: Her tender age, her form divinely fair, Her easy motion, her attractive air, Her sweet behaviour, her enchanting face, Her moving softness, and majestic grace. Much in his prudence did our Knight rejoice, And thought no mortal could dispute this choice: Once more in haste he summon'd ev'ry friend, And told them all, their pains were at an end. Heav'n, that (said he) inspir'd me first to wed, Provides a consort worthy of my bed; Let none oppose th'election, since on this Depends my quiet, and my future bliss. A dame there is, the darling of my eyes, Young, beauteous, artless, innocent and wise; Chaste, tho' not rich, and tho' not nobly born, Of honest parents, and may serve my turn. Her will I wed: if gracious heav'n so please; To pass my age in sanctity and ease: And thank the pow'rs, I may possess alone The lovely prize, and share my bliss with none! If you, my friends, this virgin can procure, My joys are full, my happiness is sure. One only doubt remains; Full oft' I've heard, By casuists grave, and deep divines averr'd; That 'tis too much for human race to know The bliss of heav'n above, and earth below. Now should the nuptial pleasures prove so great, To match the blessings of the future state, Those endless joys were ill exchang'd for these; Then clear this doubt, and set my mind at ease. This Justin heard, nor could his spleen controul, Touch'd to the quick, and tickled at the soul. Sir Knight, he cry'd, if this be all you dread, Heav'n put it past your doubt, whene'er you wed; And to my fervent pray'rs so far consent, That e'er the rites are o'er, you may repent! Good heav'n no doubt the nuptial state approves, Since it chastises still what best it loves. Then be not, Sir, abandon'd to despair; Seek, and perhaps you'll find, among the fair, One, that may do your business to a hair; Not ev'n in wish, your happiness delay, But prove the scourge to lash you on your way: Then to the skies your mounting soul shall go, Swift, as an arrow soaring from the bow! Provided still, you moderate your joy, Nor in your pleasures all your might enjoy, Let reason's rule your strong desires abate: Nor please too lavishly your gentle mate. Old wives there are, of judgment most acute, Who solve these questions beyond all dispute; Consult with those, and be of better chear; Marry, do penance, and dismiss your fear. So said, they rose, nor more the work delay'd; The match was offer'd, the proposals made. The parents, you may think, would soon comply; The Old have int'rest ever in their eye. Nor was it hard to move the Lady's mind, When fortune favours, still the Fair are kind. I pass each previous settlement and deed, Too long for me to write, or you to read; Nor will with quaint impertinence display The pomp, the pageantry, the proud array. The time approach'd, to Church the parties went, At once with carnal and devout intent: Forth came the Priest, and bade th'obedient wife Like Sarah or Rebecca, lead her life: Then pray'd the pow'rs the fruitful bed to bless, And made all sure enough with holiness. And now the palace-gates are open'd wide, The guests appear in order, side by side, And plac'd in state, the bridegroom and the bride. The breathing flute's soft notes are heard around, And the shrill trumpets mix their silver sound; The vaulted roofs with echoing music ring, These touch the vocal stops, and those the trembling string. Not thus Amphion tun'd the warbling lyre, Nor Joab the sounding clarion could inspire, Nor fierce Theodamas, whose sprightly strain Cou'd swell the soul to rage, and fire the martial train. Bacchus himself, the nuptial feast to grace, (So Poets sing) was present on the place: And lovely Venus, Goddess of delight, Shook high her flaming torch in open sight, And danc'd around, and smil'd on ev'ry Knight: Pleas'd her best servant wou'd his courage try, No less in wedlock, than in liberty. Full many an age old Hymen had not spy'd So kind a bridegroom, or so bright a bride. Ye bards! renown'd among the tuneful throng For gentle lays, and joyous nuptial song; Think not your softest numbers can display The matchless glories of this blissful day: The joys are such, as far transcend your rage, When tender youth has wedded stooping age. The beauteous dame sate smiling at the board, And darted am'rous glances at her Lord. Not Hester's self, whose charms the Hebrews sing, E'er look'd so lovely on her Persian King: Bright as the rising sun, in summer's day, And fresh and blooming as the month of May! The joyful Knight survey'd her by his side, Nor envy'd Paris with the Spartan bride: Still as his mind revolv'd with vast delight Th'entrancing raptures of th'approaching night: Restless he sate, invoking ev'ry pow'r, To speed his bliss, and haste the happy hour. Meantime the vig'rous dancers beat the ground, And songs were sung, and flowing bowls went round, With od'rous spices they perfum'd the place, And mirth and pleasure shone in ev'ry face. Damian alone, of all the menial train, Sad in the midst of triumphs, sigh'd for pain; Damian alone, the Knight's obsequious squire, Consum'd at heart, and fed a secret fire. His lovely mistress all his soul possess'd, He look'd, he languish'd, and cou'd take no rest: His task perform'd, he sadly went his way, Fell on his bed, and loath'd the light of day: There let him lie; till his relenting dame Weep in her turn, and waste in equal flame. The weary sun, as learned Poets write, Forsook th'horizon, and roll'd down the light; While glitt'ring stars his absent beams supply, And night's dark mantle overspread the sky. Then rose the guests; and as the time requir'd, Each paid his thanks, and decently retir'd. The foe once gone, our Knight prepar'd t'undress, So keen he was, and eager to possess: But first thought fit th'assistance to receive, Which grave Physicians scruple not to give; Satyrion near, with hot Eringo's stood, Cantharides, to fire the lazy blood, Whose use old Bards describe in luscious rhymes, And Critics learn'd explain to modern times. By this the sheets were spread, the bride undress'd, The room was sprinkled, and the bed was bless'd. What next ensu'd beseems not me to say; 'Tis sung, he labour'd till the dawning day, Then briskly sprung from bed, with heart so light, As all were nothing he had done by night; And sipp'd his cordial as he sate upright: He kiss'd his balmy spouse with wanton play, And feebly sung a lusty roundelay: Then on the couch his weary limbs he cast; For every labour must have rest at last. But anxious cares the pensive Squire oppress'd, Sleep fled his eyes, and peace forsook his breast; The raging flames that in his bosom dwell, He wanted art to hide, and means to tell. Yet hoping time th'occasion might betray, Compos'd a sonnet to the lovely May; Which writ and folded with the nicest art, He wrapp'd in silk, and laid upon his heart. When now the fourth revolving day was run, ('Twas June, and Cancer had receiv'd the sun) Forth from her chamber came the beauteous bride; The good old knight mov'd slowly by her side. High Mass was sung; they feasted in the hall; The servants round stood ready at their call. The squire alone was absent from the board, And much his sickness griev'd his worthy Lord, Who pray'd his spouse attended by her train, To visit Damian, and divert his pain. Th'obliging dames obey'd with one consent; They left the hall, and to his lodging went. The female tribe surround him as he lay, And close beside him sate the gentle May: Where, as she try'd his pulse, he softly drew A speaking sigh, and cast a mournful view; Then gave his bill, and brib'd the pow'rs divine With secret vows, to favour his design. Who studies now but discontented May? On her soft couch uneasily she lay: The lumpish husband snoar'd away the night, Till coughs awak'd him near the morning light. What then he did, I not presume to tell, Nor if she thought herself in heav'n or hell: Honest and dull, in nuptial bed they lay, Till the bell toll'd, and all arose to pray. Were it by forceful destiny decreed, Or did from chance, or nature's pow'r proceed; Or that some star, with aspect kind to love, Shed its selectest influence from above; Whatever was the cause, the tender dame Felt the first motions of an infant flame; Receiv'd the impressions of the love-sick squire And wasted in the soft, infectious fire. Ye fair, draw near, let May's example move Your gentle minds to pity those who love! Had some fierce tyrant in her stead been found, The poor adorer sure had hang'd, or drown'd: But she, your sex's mirrour, free from pride, Was much too meek to prove a homicide. But to my tale: Some Sages have defin'd Pleasure the sov'reign bliss of human-kind: Our Knight (who study'd much, we may suppose) Deriv'd this high philosophy from those; For, like a Prince, he bore the vast expence Of lavish pomp and proud magnificence: His house was stately, his retinue gay, Large was his train, and gorgeous his array. His spacious garden made to yield to none, Was compass'd round with walls of solid stone; Priapus could not half describe the grace (Tho' God of gardens) of this charming place: A place to tire the rambling wits of France In long descriptions, and exceed Romance; Enough to shame the gentlest bard that sings Of painted meadows, and of purling springs. Full in the centre of the flow'ry ground, A crystal fountain spread its streams around, The fruitful banks with verdant laurels crown'd: About this spring (if ancient fame say true) The dapper Elves their moon-light sports pursue: Their pigmy king, and little fairy queen, In circling dances gambol'd on the green, While tuneful sprites a merry consort made, And airy music warbled thro' the shade. Hither the noble knight would oft' repair, (His scene of pleasure, and peculiar care) For this he held it dear, and always bore The silver key that lock'd the garden-door. To this sweet place, in summer's sultry heat, He us'd from noise and bus'ness to retreat; And here in dalliance spend the live-long day, Solus cum sola, with his sprightly May. For whate'er work was undischarg'd a-bed, The duteous knight in this fair garden sped. But ah! what mortal lives of bliss secure, How short a space our worldly joys endure? O Fortune, fair, like all thy treach'rous kind, But faithless still, and wav'ring as the wind! O painted monster, form'd mankind to cheat, With pleasing poison, and with soft deceit! This rich, this am'rous, venerable knight, Amidst his ease, his solace, and delight, Struck blind by thee, resigns his days to grief, And calls on death, the wretch's last relief. The rage of jealousy then seiz'd his mind, For much he fear'd the faith of woman-kind. His wife not suffer'd from his side to stray, Was captive kept, he watch'd her night and day, Abridg'd her pleasures, and confin'd her sway. Full oft' in tears did hapless May complain, And sigh'd full oft'; but sigh'd and wept in vain; She look'd on Damian with a lover's eye, For oh, 'twas fix'd; she must possess or die! Nor less impatience vex'd her am'rous squire, Wild with delay, and burning with desire. Watch'd as she was, yet could he not refrain By secret writing to disclose his pain; The dame by signs reveal'd her kind intent, Till both were conscious what each other meant. Ah, gentle knight, what would thy eyes avail, Tho' they could see as far as ships can sail? 'Tis better sure, when blind, deceiv'd to be, Than be deluded when a man can see! Argus himself, so cautious and so wise, Was over-watch'd, for all his hundred eyes: So many an honest husband may, 'tis known, Who, wisely, never thinks the case his own. The dame at last, by diligence and care, Procur'd the key her knight was wont to bear; She took the wards in wax before the fire, And gave th'impression to the trusty squire. By means of this, some wonder shall appear, Which in due place and season, you may hear. Well sung sweet Ovid in the days of yore, What slight is that, which Love will not explore? And Pyramus and Thisbe plainly show The feats true lovers, when they list, can do: Tho' watch'd and captive, yet in spite of all, They found the art of kissing thro' a wall. But now no longer from our tale to stray; It happ'd, that once upon a summer's day, Our rev'rend knight was urg'd to am'rous play: He rais'd his spouse, e'er Matin-bell was rung, And thus his morning canticle he sung. Awake, my love, disclose thy radiant eyes; Arise, my wife, my beauteous Lady, rise! Hear how the doves with pensive notes complain, And in soft murmurs tell the trees their pain; The winter's past; the clouds and tempests fly; The sun adorns the fields, and brightens all the sky. Fair without spot, whose ev'ry charming part My bosom wounds, and captivates my heart; Come, and in mutual pleasures let's engage, Joy of my life, and comfort of my age. This heard, to Damian strait a sign she made, To haste before; the gentle squire obey'd: Secret, and undescry'd, he took his way, And ambush'd close behind an arbour lay. It was not long e'er January came, And hand in hand with him his lovely dame; Blind as he was, not doubting all was sure, He turn'd the key, and made the gate secure. Here let us walk, he said, observ'd by none, Conscious of pleasures to the world unknown: So may my soul have joy, as thou, my wife, Art far the dearest solace of my life; And rather wou'd I chuse, by heav'n above, To die this instant, than to lose thy love. Reflect what truth was in my passion shown, When un-endow'd, I took thee for my own, And sought no treasure but thy heart alone. Old as I am, and now depriv'd of sight, While thou art faithful to thy own true knight, Nor age, nor blindness, rob me of delight. Each other loss with patience I can bear, The loss of thee is what I only fear. Consider then, my Lady, and my wife, The solid comforts of a virtuous life. As first, the love of Christ himself you gain; Next, your own honour undefil'd maintain; And lastly, that which sure your mind must move, My whole estate shall gratify your love: Make your own terms, and e'er to-morrow's sun Displays his light, by heav'n it shall be done. I seal the contract with a holy kiss, And will perform, by this—my dear, and this.— Have comfort, spouse, nor think thy Lord unkind; 'Tis love, not jealousy that fires my mind. For when thy charms my sober thoughts engage, And join'd to them, my own unequal age; From thy dear side I have no pow'r to part, Such secret transports warm my melting heart. For who that once possess'd those heav'nly charms, Cou'd live one moment, absent from thy arms? He ceas'd, and May with modest grace reply'd; (Weak was her voice, as while she spoke she cry'd:) Heav'n knows, (with that, a tender sigh she drew) I have a soul to save as well as you; And, what no less you to my charge commend, My dearest honour, will to death defend. To you in holy Church I gave my hand, And join'd my heart in wedlock's sacred band: Yet after this, if you distrust my care, Then hear, my Lord, and witness what I swear: First may the yawning earth her bosom rend, And let me hence to hell alive descend; Or die the death I dread no less than hell, Sow'd in a sack, and plung'd into a well: E'er I my fame by one leud act disgrace, Or once renounce the honour of my race. For know, sir knight, of gentle blood I came, I loath a whore, and startle at the name. But jealous men on their own crimes reflect, And learn from thence their Ladies to suspect: Else why these needless cautions, Sir, to me? These doubts and fears of female constancy? This chime still rings in ev'ry Lady's ear, The only strain a wife must hope to hear. Thus while she spoke, a sidelong glance she cast, Where Damian kneeling, worshipp'd as she past. She saw him watch the motions of her eye, And singled out a Pear-tree planted nigh: 'Twas charg'd with fruit that made a goodly show, And hung with dangling pears was ev'ry bough. Thither th'obsequious squire address'd his pace, And climbing, in the summit took his place; The Knight and Lady walk'd beneath in view, Where let us leave them, and our tale pursue. 'Twas now the season when the glorious sun His heav'nly progress thro' the Twins had run; And Jove, exalted, his mild influence yields, To glad the glebe, and paint the flow'ry fields. Clear was the day, and Phœbus rising bright, Had streak'd the azure firmament with light; He pierc'd the glitt'ring clouds with golden streams, And warm'd the womb of earth with genial beams. It so befel, in that fair morning-tide, The Fairies sported on the garden's side, And, in the midst, their Monarch and his bride. So featly tripp'd the lightfoot Ladies round, The knights so nimbly o'er the greensword bound, That scarce they bent the flow'rs, or touch'd the ground. The dances ended, all the fairy train For pinks and daisies search'd the flow'ry plain; While on a bank reclin'd of rising green, Thus, with a frown, the King bespoke his Queen. 'Tis too apparent, argue what you can, The treachery you women use to man: A thousand authors have this truth made out, And sad experience leaves no room for doubt. Heav'n rest thy spirit, noble Solomon, A wiser monarch never saw the sun: All wealth, all honours, the supreme degree Of earthly bliss, was well bestow'd on thee! For sagely hast thou said; Of all mankind, One only just, and righteous, hope to find: But should'st thou search the spacious world around, Yet one good woman is not to be found. Thus says the King who knew your wickedness; The son of Sirach testifies no less. So may some wildfire on your bodies fall, Or some devouring plague consume you all; As well you view the Leacher in the tree, And well this honourable Knight you see: But since he's blind and old, (a helpless case) His squire shall cuckold him before your face. Now by my own dread majesty I swear, And by this awful sceptre which I bear, No impious wretch shall 'scape unpunish'd long, That in my presence offers such a wrong. I will this instant undeceive the knight, And, in the very act, restore his sight: And set the strumpet here in open view, A warning to these Ladies, and to you, And all the faithless sex, for ever to be true. And will you so, reply'd the Queen indeed? Now, by my mother's soul, it is decreed, She shall not want an answer at her need. For her, and for her daughters, I'll engage, And all the sex in each succeeding age; Art shall be theirs to varnish an offence, And fortify their crimes with confidence. Nay, were they taken in a strict embrace, Seen with both eyes, and pinion'd on the place; All they shall need is to protest, and swear, Breath a soft sigh, and drop a tender tear; Till their wise husbands, gull'd by arts like these, Grow gentle, tractable, and tame as geese. What tho' this sland'rous Jew, this Solomon, Call'd women fools, and knew full many a one? The wiser wits of later times declare, How constant, chaste, and virtuous, women are: Witness the martyrs, who resign'd their breath, Serene in torments, unconcern'd in death; And witness next what Roman authors tell, How Arria, Portia, and Lucretia fell. But since the sacred leaves to all are free, And men interpret texts, why shou'd not we? By this no more was meant, than to have shown, That sov'reign goodness dwells in Him alone Who only Is, and is but only One. But grant the worst; shall women then be weigh'd By ev'ry word that Solomon has said? What tho' this King (as ancient story boasts) Built a fair temple to the Lord of hosts; He ceas'd at last his Maker to adore, And did as much for Idol-gods, or more. Beware what lavish praises you confer On a rank leacher and idolater; Whose reign indulgent God, says holy writ, Did but for David's righteous sake permit; David, the monarch after heav'ns own mind, Who lov'd our sex, and honour'd all our kind. Well, I'm a woman, and as such must speak; Silence would swell me, and my heart would break. Know then, I scorn your dull authorities, Your idle wits, and all their learned lyes. By heav'n, those authors are our sex's foes, Whom, in our right, I must, and will oppose. Nay (quoth the King) dear Madam, be not wroth: I yield it up; but since I gave my oath, That this much-injur'd knight again shou'd see; It must be done—I am a King, said he, And one, whose faith has ever sacred been. And so has mine, (she said)—I am a Queen; Her answer she shall have, I undertake; And thus an end of all dispute I make: Try when you list; and you shall find, my Lord, It is not in our sex to break our word. We leave them here in this heroick strain, And to the knight our story turns again; Who in the garden, with his lovely May, Sung merrier than the Cuckow or the Jay: This was his song; “Oh kind and constant be, “Constant and kind I'll ever prove to thee. Thus singing as he went, at last he drew By easy steps to where the Peartree grew: The longing dame look'd up, and spy'd her Love Full fairly perch'd among the boughs above. She stopp'd, and sighing: Oh good Gods, she cry'd, What pangs, what sudden shoots distend my side? O for that tempting fruit, so fresh, so green; Help, for the love of heav'ns immortal Queen! Help, dearest lord, and save at once the life Of thy poor infant, and thy longing wife! Sore sigh'd the knight to hear his Lady's cry, But cou'd not climb, and had no servant nigh: Old as he was, and void of eye-sight too, What cou'd, alas! the helpless husband do? And must I languish then, she said, and die, Yet view the lovely fruit before my eye? At least, kind Sir, for charity's sweet sake, Vouchsafe the trunk between your arms to take; Then from your back I might ascend the tree; Do you but stoop, and leave the rest to me. With all my soul, he thus reply'd again, I'd spend my dearest blood to ease thy pain; With that, his back against the trunk he bent, She seiz'd a twig, and up the tree she went. Now prove your patience, gentle Ladies all! Nor let on me your heavy anger fall: 'Tis truth I tell, tho' not in phrase refin'd; Tho' blunt my tale, yet honest is my mind. What feats the Lady in the tree might do, I pass, as gambols never known to you; But sure it was a merrier fit, she swore, Than in her life she ever felt before. In that nice moment, lo! the wond'ring knight Look'd out, and stood restor'd to sudden sight. Strait on the tree his eager eyes he bent, As one whose thoughts were on his spouse intent; But when he saw his bosom-wife so dress'd, His rage was such as cannot be express'd: Not frantic mothers when their infants die, With louder clamours rend the vaulted sky: He cry'd, he roar'd, he storm'd, he tore his hair; Death! hell! and furies! what dost thou do there? What ails my lord? the trembling dame reply'd; I thought your patience had been better try'd: Is this your love, ungrateful and unkind, This my reward, for having cur'd the blind? Why was I taught to make my husband see, By struggling with a Man upon a Tree? Did I, for this, the pow'r of magic prove? Unhappy wife, whose crime was too much love! If this be struggling, by this holy light, 'Tis struggling with a vengeance, (quoth the knight) So heav'n preserve the sight it has restor'd, As with these eyes I plainly saw thee whor'd; Whor'd by my slave—perfidious wretch! may hell As surely seize thee, as I saw too well. Guard me, good angels! cry'd the gentle May, Pray heav'n, this magic work the proper way! Alas, my love! 'tis certain, could you see, You ne'er had us'd these killing words to me: So help me fates, as 'tis no perfect sight, But some faint glimm'ring of a doubtful light. What I have said, (quoth he) I must maintain, For by th'immortal pow'rs, it seem'd too plain— By all those pow'rs, some frenzy seiz'd your mind, (Reply'd the dame) are these the thanks I find? Wretch that I am, that e'er I was so kind! She said; a rising sigh express'd her woe, The ready tears apace began to flow, And as they fell, she wip'd from either eye The drops, (for women, when they list, can cry.) The knight was touch'd, and in his looks appear'd Signs of remorse, while thus his spouse he chear'd. Madam, 'tis past, and my short anger o'er; Come down, and vex your tender heart no more: Excuse me, dear, if aught amiss was said, For, on my soul, amends shall soon be made: Let my repentance your forgiveness draw, By heav'n, I swore but what I thought I saw. Ah my lov'd lord! 'twas much unkind (she cry'd) On bare suspicion thus to treat your bride. But till your sight's establish'd, for a while, Imperfect objects may your sense beguile. Thus when from sleep we first our eyes display, The balls are wounded with the piercing ray, And dusky vapours rise, and intercept the day. So just recov'ring from the shades of night, Your swimming eyes are drunk with sudden light, Strange phantoms dance around, and skim before your sight. Then, Sir, be cautious, nor too rashly deem; Heav'n knows how seldom things are what they seem! Consult your reason, and you soon shall find 'Twas you were jealous, not your wife unkind: Jove ne'er spoke Oracle more true than this, None judge so wrong as those who think amiss. With that, she leap'd into her Lord's embrace, With well-dissembled virtue in her face. He hugg'd her close, and kiss'd her o'er and o'er, Disturb'd with doubts and jealousies no more: Both, pleas'd and bless'd, renew'd their mutual vows, A fruitful wife, and a believing spouse. Thus ends our tale, whose moral next to make, Let all wise husbands hence example take; And pray, to crown the pleasure of their lives, To be so well deluded by their wives. THE WIFE of BATH HER PROLOGUE, FROM CHAUCER. Behold the woes of matrimonial life, And hear with rev'rence an experienc'd wife! To dear-bought wisdom give the credit due, And think, for once, a woman tells you true. In all these trials I have born a part, I was myself the scourge that caus'd the smart; For, since fifteen, in triumph have I led Five captive husbands from the church to bed. Christ saw a wedding once, the scripture says, And saw but one, 'tis thought, in all his days; Whence some infer, whose conscience is too nice, No pious Christian ought to marry twice. But let them read, and solve me, if they can, The words address'd to the Samaritan: Five times in lawful wedlock she was join'd; And sure the certain stint was ne'er defin'd. Encrease and multiply was heav'ns command, And that's a text I clearly understand. This too, “Let men their sires and mothers leave, “And to their dearer wives for ever cleave. More wives than one by Solomon were try'd, Or else the wisest of mankind's bely'd. I've had myself full many a merry fit; And trust in heav'n I may have many yet. For when my transitory spouse, unkind, Shall die, and leave his woeful wife behind, I'll take the next good Christian I can find. Paul, knowing one could never serve our turn, Declar'd 'twas better far to wed, than burn. There's danger in assembling fire and tow; I grant 'em that, and what it means you know. The same Apostle too has elsewhere own'd, No precept for Virginity he found: 'Tis but a counsel—and we women still Take which we like, the counsel, or our will. I envy not their bliss, if he or she Think fit to live in perfect chastity; Pure let them be, and free from taint of vice; I, for a few slight spots, am not so nice. Heav'n calls us diff'rent ways, on these bestows One proper gift, another grants to those: Not ev'ry man's oblig'd to sell his store, And give up all his substance to the poor; Such as are perfect, may, I can't deny; But, by your leave, Divines, so am not I. Full many a Saint, since first the world began, Liv'd an unspotted maid, in spite of man: Let such (a God's name) with fine wheat be fed, And let us honest wives eat barley-bread. For me, I'll keep the post assign'd by heav'n, And use the copious talent it has giv'n: Let my good spouse pay tribute, do me right, And keep an equal reck'ning ev'ry night: His proper body is not his, but mine; For so said Paul, and Paul's a sound divine. Know then, of those five husbands I have had, Three were just tolerable, two were bad. The three were old, but rich and fond beside, And toil'd most piteously to please their bride: But since their wealth (the best they had) was mine, The rest, without much loss, I could resign. Sure to be lov'd, I took no pains to please, Yet had more pleasure far than they had Ease. Presents flow'd in apace: with show'rs of gold, They made their court, like Jupiter of old. If I but smil'd, a sudden youth they found, And a new palsy seiz'd them when I frown'd. Ye sov'reign wives! give ear, and understand; Thus shall ye speak, and exercise command. For never was it giv'n to mortal man, To lye so boldly as we women can. Forswear the fact, tho' seen with both his eyes, And call your maids to witness how he lyes. Hark, old Sir Paul! ('twas thus I us'd to say) Whence is our neighbour's wife so rich and gay? Treated, caress'd, where'er she's pleas'd to roam— I sit in tatters, and immur'd at home. Why to her house dost thou so oft repair? Art thou so am'rous? and is she so fair? If I but see a cousin, or a friend, Lord! how you swell, and rage like any fiend! But you reel home, a drunken beastly bear, Then preach till midnight in your easy chair, Cry, wives are false, and ev'ry woman evil, And give up all that's female to the devil. If poor (you say) she drains her husband's purse; If rich, she keeps her priest, or something worse; If highly born, intolerably vain, Vapours and pride by turns possess her brain, Now gayly mad, now sourly splenetick, Freakish when well, and fretful when she's sick. If fair, then chaste she cannot long abide, By pressing youth attack'd on ev'ry side. If foul, her wealth the lusty lover lures, Or else her wit some fool-gallant procures, Or else she dances with becoming grace, Or shape excuses the defects of face. There swims no goose so grey, but, soon or late, She finds some honest gander for her mate. Horses (thou say'st) and asses, men may try, And ring suspected vessels e'er they buy: But wives, a random choice, untry'd they take, They dream in courtship, but in wedlock wake: Then, nor till then, the veil's remov'd away, And all the woman glares in open day. You tell me, to preserve your wife's good grace, Your eyes must always languish on my face, Your tongue with constant flatt'ries feed my ear, And tag each sentence with, My life! my dear! If, by strange chance, a modest blush be rais'd, Be sure my fine complexion must be prais'd. My garments always must be new and gay, And feasts still kept upon my wedding-day. Then must my Nurse be pleas'd, and fav'rite maid; And endless treats, and endless visits paid, To a long train of kindred, friends, allies; All this thou say'st, and all thou say'st are lyes. On Jenkin too you cast a squinting eye: What? can your Prentice raise your jealousy? Fresh are his ruddy cheeks, his forehead fair, And like the burnish'd gold his curling hair. But clear thy wrinkled brow, and quit thy sorrow, I'd scorn your prentice, should you die to-morrow. Why are thy chests all lock'd? on what design? Are not thy worldly goods and treasure mine? Sir, I'm no fool: nor shall you, by St. John, Have goods and body to your self alone. One you shall quit, in spite of both your eyes— I heed not, I, the bolts, the locks, the spies. If you had wit, you'd say, “Go where you will, “Dear spouse, I credit not the tales they tell: “Take all the freedoms of a married life; “I know thee for a virtuous, faithful wife. Lord! when you have enough, what need you care How merrily soever others fare? Tho' all the day I give and take delight, Doubt not, sufficient will be left at night. 'Tis but a just and rational desire, To light a taper at a neighbour's fire. There's danger too, you think, in rich array, And none can long be modest that are gay: The Cat, if you but singe her tabby skin, The chimney keeps, and sits content within; But once grown sleek, will from her corner run, Sport with her tail, and wanton in the sun; She licks her fair round face, and frisks abroad, To show her furr, and to be catterwaw'd. Lo thus, my friends, I wrought to my desires These three right ancient venerable sires. I told 'em, thus you say, and thus you do— And told 'em false, but Jenkin swore 'twas true. I, like a dog, could bite as well as whine, And first complain'd, whene'er the guilt was mine. I tax'd them oft' with wenching and amours, When their weak legs scarce dragg'd 'em out of doors; And swore the rambles that I took by night, Were all to spy what damsels they bedight. That colour brought me many hours of mirth; For all this wit is giv'n us from our birth. Heav'n gave to woman the peculiar grace To spin, to weep, and cully human race. By this nice conduct, and this prudent course, By murm'ring, wheedling, stratagem, and force, I still prevail'd, and would be in the right, Or curtain-lectures made a restless night. If once my husband's arm was o'er my side, What! so familiar with your spouse? I cry'd: I levied first a tax upon his need; Then let him—'twas a Nicety indeed! Let all mankind this certain maxim hold, Marry who will, our Sex is to be sold. With empty hands no tassels you can lure, But fulsom love for gain we can endure; For gold we love the impotent and old, And heave, and pant, and kiss, and cling, for gold. Yet with embraces, curses oft' I mixt, Then kiss'd again, and chid and rail'd betwixt. Well, I may make my will in peace, and die, For not one word in man's arrears am I. To drop a dear Dispute I was unable, Ev'n tho' the Pope himself had set at table. But when my point was gain'd, then thus I spoke, “Billy, my dear, how sheepishly you look? “Approach, my spouse, and let me kiss thy cheek; “Thou should'st be always thus, resign'd and meek! “Of Job's great patience since so oft' you preach, “Well should you practise, who so well can teach. “'Tis difficult to do, I must allow, “But I, my dearest, will instruct you how. “Great is the blessing of a prudent wife, “Who puts a period to domestic strife. “One of us two must rule, and one obey; “And since in man right reason bears the sway, “Let that frail thing, weak woman, have her way. “The wives of all my family have rul'd “Their tender husbands, and their passions cool'd. “Fye, 'tis unmanly thus to sigh and groan; “What! would you have me to your self alone? “Why take me, Love! take all and ev'ry part! “Here's your revenge! you love it at your heart. “Would I vouchsafe to sell what nature gave, “You little think what custom I could have? “But see! I'm all your own—nay hold—for shame! “What means my dear—indeed—you are to blame. Thus with my first three Lords I past my life; A very woman, and a very wife. What sums from these old spouses I could raise, Procur'd young husbands in my riper days. Tho' past my bloom, not yet decay'd was I, Wanton and wild, and chatter'd like a pye. In country dances still I bore the bell, And sung as sweet as evening Philomel. To clear my quail-pipe, and refresh my soul, Full oft' I drain'd the spicy nut-brown bowl; Rich luscious wines, that youthful blood improve, And warm the swelling veins to feats of love: For 'tis as sure, as cold ingenders hail, A liqu'rish mouth must have a lech'rous tail; Wine lets no lover unrewarded go, As all true gamesters by experience know. But oh good Gods! whene'er a thought I cast On all the joys of youth and beauty past, To find in pleasures I have had my part, Still warms me to the bottom of my heart. This wicked world was once my dear delight; Now all my conquests, all my charms good night! The flour consum'd, the best that now I can, Is e'en to make my market of the bran. My fourth dear spouse was not exceeding true; He kept, 'twas thought, a private miss or two: But all that score I paid—as how? you'll say, Not with my body, in a filthy way: But I so dress'd, and danc'd, and drank, and din'd; And view'd a friend, with eyes so very kind, As stung his heart, and made his marrow fry With burning rage, and frantick jealousy. His soul, I hope, enjoys eternal glory, For here on earth I was his purgatory. Oft', when his shoe the most severely wrung, He put on careless airs, and sat and sung. How sore I gall'd him, only heav'n could know, And he that felt, and I that caus'd the woe. He dy'd, when last from pilgrimage I came, With other gossips, from Jerusalem; And now lies buried underneath a Rood, Fair to be seen, and rear'd of honest wood. A tomb, indeed, with fewer sculptures grac'd, Than that Mausolus' pious widow plac'd, Or where inshrin'd the great Darius lay; But cost on graves is merely thrown away. The pit fill'd up, with turf we cover'd o'er; So bless the good man's soul, I say no more. Now for my fifth lov'd Lord, the last and best; (Kind heav'n afford him everlasting rest) Full hearty was his love, and I can shew The tokens on my ribs, in black and blue; Yet, with a knack, my heart he could have won, While yet the smart was shooting in the bone. How quaint an appetite in women reigns! Free gifts we scorn, and love what costs us pains: Let men avoid us, and on them we leap; A glutted market makes provision cheap. In pure good will I took this jovial spark, Of Oxford he, a most egregious clerk. He boarded with a widow in the town, A trusty gossip, one dame Alison. Full well the secrets of my soul she knew, Better than e'er our parish Priest could do. To her I told whatever could befall; Had but my husband piss'd against a wall, Or done a thing that might have cost his life, She—and my niece—and one more worthy wife, Had known it all: what most he would conceal, To these I made no scruple to reveal. Oft' has he blush'd from ear to ear for shame, That e'er he told a secret to his dame. It so befel, in holy time of Lent, That oft' a day I to this gossip went; (My husband, thank my stars, was out of town) From house to house we rambled up and down, This clerk, my self, and my good neighbour Alce, To see, be seen, to tell, and gather tales. Visits to ev'ry Church we daily paid, And march'd in ev'ry holy Masquerade, The Stations duly, and the Vigils kept; Not much we fasted, but scarce ever slept. At Sermons too I shone in scarlet gay; The wasting moth ne'er spoil'd my best array, The cause was this, I wore it ev'ry day. 'Twas when fresh May her early blossoms yields, This Clerk and I were walking in the fields. We grew so intimate, I can't tell how, I pawn'd my honour, and engag'd my vow, If e'er I laid my husband in his urn, That he, and only he, should serve my turn. We strait struck hands, the bargain was agreed; I still have shifts against a time of need: The mouse that always trusts to one poor hole, Can never be a mouse of any soul. I vow'd, I scarce could sleep since first I knew him, And durst be sworn he had bewitch'd me to him; If e'er I slept, I dream'd of him alone, And dreams foretel, as learned men have shown; All this I said; but dream, sirs, I had none: I follow'd but my crafty Crony's lore, Who bid me tell this lye—and twenty more. Thus day by day, and month by month we past; It pleas'd the Lord to take my spouse at last. I tore my gown, I soil'd my locks with dust, And beat my breasts, as wretched widows—must. Before my face my handkerchief I spread, To hide the flood of tears I did—not shed. The good man's coffin to the Church was born; Around, the neighbours, and my clerk too, mourn. But as he march'd, good Gods! he show'd a pair Of legs and feet, so clean, so strong, so fair! Of twenty winters age he seem'd to be; I (to say truth) was twenty more than he; But vig'rous still, a lively buxom dame; And had a wond'rous gift to quench a flame. A Conj'rer once, that deeply could divine, Assur'd me, Mars in Taurus was my sign. As the stars order'd, such my life has been: Alas, alas, that ever love was sin! Fair Venus gave me fire, and sprightly grace, And Mars assurance, and a dauntless face. By virtue of this pow'rful constellation, I follow'd always my own inclination. But to my tale: A month scarce pass'd away, With dance and song we kept the nuptial day. All I possess'd I gave to his command, My goods and chattels, mony, house, and land: But oft' repented, and repent it still; He prov'd a rebel to my sov'reign will: Nay once by heav'n he struck me on the face; Hear but the fact, and judge yourselves the case. Stubborn as any Lioness was I; And knew full well to raise my voice on high; As true a rambler as I was before, And would be so, in spite of all he swore. He, against this right sagely would advise, And old examples set before my eyes; Tell how the Roman matrons led their life, Of Gracchus' mother, and Duilius' wife; And chose the sermon, as beseem'd his wit, With some grave sentence out of holy writ. Oft' would he say, Who builds his house on sands, Pricks his blind horse across the fallow lands, Or lets his wife abroad with pilgrims roam, Deserves a fool's-cap and long ears at home. All this avail'd not; for whoe'er he be That tells my faults, I hate him mortally: And so do numbers more, I'll boldly say, Men, women, clergy, regular, and lay. My spouse (who was, you know, to learning bred) A certain treatise oft' at evening read, Where divers Authors (whom the dev'l confound For all their lyes) were in one volume bound. Valerius, whole; and of St. Jerome, part; Chrysippus and Tertullian, Ovid's Art, Solomon's proverbs, Eloïsa's loves; And many more than sure the Church approves. More legends were there here, of wicked wives, Than good, in all the Bible and Saints-lives. Who drew the Lion vanquish'd? 'Twas a Man. But cou'd we women write as scholars can, Men should stand mark'd with far more wickedness, Than all the sons of Adam could redress. Love seldom haunts the breast where Learning lies, And Venus sets e'er Mercury can rise. Those play the scholars who can't play the men, And use that weapon which they have, their pen; When old, and past the relish of delight, Then down they sit, and in their dotage write, That not one woman keeps her marriage-vow. (This by the way, but to my purpose now.) It chanc'd my husband, on a winter's night, Read in this book, aloud, with strange delight, How the first female (as the scriptures show) Brought her own spouse and all his race to woe. How Sampson fell; and he whom Dejanire Wrap'd in th'envenom'd shirt, and set on fire. How curs'd Eryphile her Lord betray'd, And the dire ambush Clytemnestra laid. But what most pleas'd him was the Cretan dame, And husband-bull—oh monstrous! fie for shame! He had by heart, the whole detail of woe Xantippe made her good man undergo; How oft' she scolded in a day, he knew, How many piss-pots on the sage she threw; Who took it patiently, and wipe'd his head; Rain follows thunder, that was all he said. He read, how Arius to his friend complain'd, A fatal Tree was growing in his land, On which three wives successively had twin'd A sliding noose, and waver'd in the wind. Where grows this plant (reply'd the friend) oh where? For better fruit did never orchard bear. Give me some slip of this most blissful tree, And in my garden planted shall it be. Then how two wives their lord's destruction prove, Thro' hatred one, and one thro' too much love; That for her husband mix'd a pois'nous draught, And this for lust an am'rous philtre bought, The nimble juice soon seiz'd his giddy head, Frantic at night, and in the morning dead. How some with swords their sleeping lords have slain, And some have hammer'd nails into their brain, And some have drench'd them with a deadly potion; All this he read, and read with great devotion. Long time I heard, and swell'd, and blush'd, and frown'd; But when no end of these vile tales I found, When still he read, and laugh'd, and read again, And half the night was thus consum'd in vain; Provok'd to vengeance, three large leaves I tore, And with one buffet fell'd him on the floor. With that, my husband in a fury rose, And down he settled me with hearty blows. I groan'd, and lay extended on my side; Oh! thou hast slain me for my wealth (I cry'd) Yet I forgive thee—take my last embrace— He wept, kind soul! and stoop'd to kiss my face; I took him such a box as turn'd him blue, Then sigh'd and cry'd, Adieu, my dear, adieu! But after many a hearty struggle past, I condescended to be pleas'd at last. Soon as he said, My mistress and my wife, Do what you list, the term of all your life: I took to heart the merits of the cause, And stood content to rule by wholesome laws; Receiv'd the Reins of absolute command, With all the government of house and land, And empire o'er his tongue, and o'er his hand. As for the volume that revil'd the dames, 'Twas torn to fragments, and condemn'd to flames. Now heav'n on all my husbands gone, bestow Pleasures above, for tortures felt below: That rest they wish'd for, grant them in the grave, And bless those souls my conduct help'd to save! IMITATIONS OF ENGLISH POETS: Done by the Author in his Youth. I. CHAUCER. [Women ben full of Ragerie] Women ben full of Ragerie, Yet swinken nat sans secresie. Thilke moral shall ye understond, From Schole-boy's Tale of fayre Irelond: Which to the Fennes hath him betake, To filch the gray Ducke fro the Lake. Right then, there passen by the Way His Aunt, and eke her Daughters tway. Ducke in his Trowses hath he hent, Not to be spied of Ladies gent. “But ho! our Nephew, (crieth one,) “Ho! quoth another, Cozen John; And stoppen, and lough, and callen out,— This sely Clerk full low doth lout: They asken that, and talken this, “Lo here is Coz, and here is Miss. But, as he glozeth with Speeches soote, The Ducke sore tickleth his Erse roote: Fore-piece and buttons all-to-brest, Forth thrust a white neck, and red crest. Te-he cry'd Ladies; Clerke nought spake: Miss star'd; and gray Ducke crieth Quaake. “O Moder, Moder, (quoth the daughter,) “Be thilke same thing Maids longer a'ter? “Bette is to pyne on Coals and chalke, “Then trust on Mon, whose yerde can talke. II. SPENSER. The Alley. I In ev'ry Town, where Thamis rolls his Tyde, A narrow Pass there is, with Houses low; Where ever and anon, the Stream is ey'd, And many a Boat soft sliding to and fro. There oft' are heard the notes of Infant Woe, The short thick Sob, loud Scream, and shriller Squall: How can ye, Mothers, vex your Children so? Some play, some eat, some cack against the wall, And as they crouchen low, for bread and butter call. II And on the broken pavement, here and there, Doth many a stinking sprat and herring lie; A brandy and tobacco shop is near, And hens, and dogs, and hogs are feeding by; And here a sailor's jacket hangs to dry. At ev'ry door are sun-burnt Matrons seen, Mending old nets to catch the scaly fry; Now singing shrill, and scolding eft between; Scolds answer foul-mouth'd scolds; bad neighbourhood I ween. III The snappish cur, (the passengers annoy) Close at my heel with yelping treble flies; The whimp'ring girl, and hoarser-screaming boy, Join to the yelping treble, shrilling cries; The scolding Quean to louder notes doth rise, And her full pipes those shrilling cries confound; To her full pipes the grunting hog replies; The grunting hogs alarm the Neighbours round, And curs, girls, boys, and scolds, in the deep base are drown'd. IV Hard by a Sty, beneath a roof of thatch, Dwelt Obloquy, who in her early days Baskets of fish at Billinsgate did watch, Cod, whiting, oyster, mackrel, sprat, or plaice: There learn'd she speech from tongues that never cease. Slander beside her, like a Magpie, chatters, With Envy, (spitting Cat) dread foe to peace; Like a curs'd Cur, Malice before her clatters, And vexing ev'ry wight, tears clothes and all to tatters. V Her dugs were mark'd by ev'ry Collier's hand, Her mouth was black as bull-dogs at the stall: She scratched, bit, and spar'd ne lace ne band, And bitch and rogue her answer was to all; Nay, e'en the parts of shame by name would call: Yea when she passed by or lane or nook, Would greet the man who turn'd him to the Wall, And by his hand obscene the porter took, Nor ever did askance like modest Virgin look. VI Such place hath Deptford, navy-building town, Woolwich and Wapping, smelling strong of pitch; Such Lambeth, envy of each band and gown, And Twick'nam such, which fairer scenes enrich Grots, statues, urns, and Jo?n's Dog and bitch, Ne village is without, on either side, All up the silver Thames, or all adown; Ne Richmond's self, from whose tall front are ey'd Vales, spires, meandring streams, and Windsor's tow'ry pride. III. WALLER. Of a Lady singing to her Lute. Fair Charmer cease, nor make your voice's prize A heart resign'd the conquest of your eyes: Well might, alas! that threatned vessel fail, Which winds and lightning both at once assail. We were too blest with these inchanting lays, Which must be heav'nly when an Angel plays: But killing charms your lover's death contrive, Lest heav'nly music shou'd be heard alive. Orpheus cou'd charm the trees, but thus a tree, Taught by your hand, can charm no less than he; A Poet made the silent wood pursue, This vocal wood had drawn the Poet too. IV. COWLEY. The Garden. Fain would my Muse the flow'ry Treasures sing, And humble glories of the youthful Spring; Where opening Roses breathing sweets diffuse, And soft Carnations show'r their balmy dews; Where Lillies smile in virgin robes of white, The thin Undress of superficial Light, And vary'd Tulips show so dazling gay, Blushing in bright diversities of day. Each painted flouret in the lake below Surveys its beauties, whence its beauties grow; And pale Narcissus on the bank, in vain Transformed, gazes on himself again. Here aged trees Cathedral walks compose, And mount the Hill in venerable rows: There the green Infants in their beds are laid, The Garden's Hope, and its expected shade. Here Orange-trees with blooms and pendants shine, And vernal honours to their autumn join; Exceed their promise in the ripen'd store, Yet in the rising blossom promise more. There in bright drops the crystal Fountains play, By Laurels shielded from the piercing Day: Where Daphne, now a tree as once a maid, Still from Apollo vindicates her shade, Still turns her beauties from th'invading beam, Nor seeks in vain for succour to the Stream. The stream at once preserves her virgin leaves, At once a shelter from her boughs receives, Where Summer's beauty midst of Winter stays, And Winter's Coolness spite of Summer's rays. Weeping. While Celia's Tears make sorrow bright, Proud Grief sits swelling in her eyes; The Sun, next those the fairest light, Thus from the Ocean first did rise: And thus thro' Mists we see the Sun, Which else we durst not gaze upon. These silver drops, like morning dew, Foretell the fervour of the day: So from one Cloud soft show'rs we view, And blasting lightnings burst away. The Stars that fall from Celia's eye, Declare, our Doom is drawing nigh. The Baby in that sunny Sphere So like a Phaëton appears, That Heav'n, the threaten'd World to spare, Though fit to drown him in her tears: Else might th'ambitious Nymph aspire, To set, like him, Heav'n too on fire. V. E. of ROCHESTER. On Silence. I Silence! coeval with Eternity; Thou wert, e'er Nature's self began to be, 'Twas one vast Nothing, all, and all slept fast in thee. II Thine was the sway, e'er heav'n was form'd, or earth, E'er fruitful Thought conceiv'd creation's birth, Or midwife Word gave aid, and spoke the infant forth. III Then various elements, against thee join'd, In one more various animal combin'd, And fram'd the clam'rous race of busy Human-kind. IV The tongue mov'd gently first, and speech was low, 'Till wrangling Science taught it noise and show, And wicked Wit arose, thy most abusive foe. V But rebel Wit deserts thee oft' in vain; Lost in the maze of words, he turns again, And seeks a surer state, and courts thy gentler reign. VI Afflicted Sense thou kindly dost set free, Oppress'd with argumental tyranny, And routed Reason finds a safe retreat in thee. VII With thee in private modest Dulness lies, And in thy bosom lurks in Thought's disguise; Thou varnisher of Fools, and cheat of all the Wife! VIII Yet thy indulgence is by both confest; Folly by thee lies sleeping in the breast, And 'tis in thee at last that Wisdom seeks for rest. IX Silence, the knave's repute, the whore's good name, The only honour of the wishing dame; Thy very want of tongue makes thee a kind of Fame. X But could'st thou seize some tongues that now are free, How Church and State would be oblig'd to thee? At Senate, and at Bar, how welcome would'st thou be? XI Yet speech ev'n there, submissively withdraws From rights of subjects, and the poor man's cause: Then pompous Silence reigns, and stills the noisy Laws. XII Past services of friends, good deeds of foes, What Fav'rites gain, and what the Nation owes, Fly the forgetful world, and in thy arms repose. XIII The country wit, religion of the town, The courtier's learning, policy o'th' gown, Are best by thee express'd, and shine in thee alone. XIV The parson's cant, the lawyer's sophistry, Lord's quibble, critic's jest; all end in thee, All rest in peace at last, and sleep eternally. VI. E. of DORSET. Artimesia. Tho' Artimesia talks, by fits, Of councils, classics, fathers, wits; Reads Malbranche, Boyle, and Locke: Yet in some things methinks she fails, 'Twere well if she would pare her nails, And wear a cleaner smock. Haughty and huge as High-Dutch bride, Such nastiness, and so much pride Are odly join'd by fate: On her large squab you find her spread, Like a fat corpse upon a bed, That lies and stinks in state. She wears no colours (sign of grace) On any part except her face; All white and black beside: Dauntless her look, her gesture proud, Her voice theatrically loud, And masculine her stride. So have I seen, in black and white A prating thing, a Magpy hight, Majestically stalk; A stately, worthless animal, That plies the tongue, and wags the tail, All flutter, pride, and talk. Phryne. Phryne had talents for mankind, Open she was, and unconfin'd, Like some free port of trade: Merchants unloaded here their freight, And Agents from each foreign state, Here first their entry made. Her learning and good breeding such, Whether th'Italian or the Dutch, Spaniard or French came to her; To all obliging she'd appear: 'Twas si Signior, 'twas yaw Mynheer, 'Twas s'il vous plaist, Monsieur. Obscure by birth, renown'd by crimes, Still changing names, religions, climes, At length she turns a Bride: In di'monds, pearls, and rich brocades, She shines the first of batter'd jades, And flutters in her pride. So have I known those Insects fair (Which curious Germans hold so rare,) Still vary shapes and dyes; Still gain new Titles with new forms; First grubs obscene, then wriggling worms, Then painted butterflies. VII. Dr. SWIFT. The Happy Life of a Country Parson. Parson, these things in thy possessing, Are better than the Bishop's blessing. A Wife that makes conserves; a Steed That carries double when there's need: October, store, and best Virginia, Tythe-Pig, and mortuary Guinea: Gazettes sent gratis down, and frank'd, For which thy Patron's weekly thank'd: A large Concordance, bound long since: Sermons to Charles the First, when Prince; A Chronicle of ancient standing; A Chrysostom to smooth thy band in. The Polyglott—three parts,—my text, Howbeit,—likewise—now to my next, Lo here the Septuagint,—and Paul, To sum the whole,—the close of all. He that has these, may pass his life, Drink with the 'Squire, and kiss his wife; On Sundays preach, and eat his fill; And fast on Fridays,—if he will; Toast Church and Queen, explain the News, Talk with Church-Wardens about Pews, Pray heartily for some new Gift, And shake his head at Doctor S?t.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. IV. Containing the DUNCIAD, WITH THE Prolegomena of Scriblerus, AND Notes Variorum. THE DUNCIAD: TO Dr. JONATHAN SWIFT. [Book I.] Argument to Book the First. The Proposition, the Invocation, and the Inscription. Then the Original of the great Empire of Dulness, and cause of the continuance thereof. The beloved seat of the Goddess is described, with her chief attendants and officers, her functions, operations, and effects. Then the poem hastes into the midst of things, presenting her on the evening of a Lord Mayor's day, revolving the long succession of her sons, and the glories past and to come. She fixes her eye on Tibbald to be the instrument of that great event which is the Subject of the poem. He is described pensive in his study, giving up the cause, and apprehending the period of her empire from the old age of the present monarch Settle: Wherefore debating whether to betake himself to Law or Politicks, he raises an altar of proper books, and (making first his solemn prayer and declaration) purposes thereon to sacrifice all his unsuccessful writings. As the pile is kindled, the Goddess beholding the flame from her seat, flies in person and puts it out, by casting upon it the poem of Thule. She forthwith reveals herself to him, transports him to her Temple, unfolds her arts, and initiates him into her mysteries; then announcing the death of Settle that night, anoints, and proclaims him Successor. Remarks on Book the First. This Poem was writ in 1726. In the next year an imperfect Edition was published at Dublin, and reprinted at London in 120. another at Dublin, and another at London in 8vo, and three others in 120. the same year. But there was no perfect Edition before that of London in 4to 1728, which was attended with the following Notes. We are willing to acquaint Posterity that this Poem (as it here stands) was presented to King George the Second and his Queen, by the hands of Sir Robert Walpole, on the 12th of March, 1728–9 The Dunciad, Sic M. S. It may be well disputed whether this be a right reading? Ought it not rather to be spelled Dunceiad, as the Etimology, evidently demands? Dunce with an e. therefore Dunceiad with an e. That accurate and punctual Man of Letters, the Restorer of Shakespeare, constantly observes the preservation of this very letter e, in spelling the name of his beloved Author, and not like his common careless Editors, with the omission of one, nay sometimes of two ee's [as Shak'spear] which is utterly unpardonable. Nor is the neglect of a Single Letter so trivial as to some it may appear; the alteration whereof in a learned language is an Atchievement that brings honour to the Critic who advances it; and Dr. B. will be remembred to posterity for his performances of this sort, as long as the world shall have any esteem for the Remains of Menander and Philemon. Theobald. I have a just value for the letter E, and the same affection for the name of this poem, as the forecited Critic for that of his author; yet cannot it induce me to agree with those who would add yet another e to it, and call it the Dunceiade; which being a French and foreign termination, is no way proper to a word entirely English, and vernacular. One e therefore in this case is right, and two e's wrong. Yet upon the whole I shall follow the Manuscript, and print it without any e at all; mov'd thereto by Authority, at all times with Critics, equal if not superior to Reason. In which method of proceeding, I can never enough praise my very good friend, the exact Mr. Tho. Hearne; who, if any word occur which to him and all mankind is evidently wrong, yet keeps he it in the Text with due reverence, and only remarks in the Margin, sic M. S. In like manner we shall not amend this error in the Title itself, but only note it obiter, to evince to the learned that it was not our fault, nor any effect of our ignorance or inattention. Scriblerus. Remarks. V. 1. Books and the Man I sing, the first who brings The Smithfield Muses to the Ear of Kings. ] Wonderful is the stupidity of all the former Critics and Commentators on this work! it breaks forth at the very first line. The author of the Critique prefix'd to Sawney, a Poem, p. 5. hath been so dull as to explain The Man who brings, &amp;c. not of the Hero of the piece, but of our Poet himself, as if he vaunted that Kings were to be his readers (an honour which tho' this Poem hath had, yet knoweth how to receive it with more modestly.) We remit this ignorant to the first lines of the Æneid; assuring him, that Virgil there speaketh not of himself, but of Æneas. Arma virumque cano, Trojæ qui primus ab oris, Italian sato profugus, Lavinaque venit Litora: multum ille &amp; terris jactatus &amp; alto, &amp;c. I cite the whole three verses, that I may by the way offer a Conjectural Emendation, purely my own, upon each: First, oris should be read aris, it being as we see Æn. 2. 513. from the altar of Jupiter Hercæus that Æneas fled as soon as he saw Priam slain. In the second line I would read statu for sato, since it is most clear it was by Winds that he arrived at the shore of Italy. Jactatus in the third, is surely as improperly apply'd to terris, as proper to alto: to say a man is tost on land, is much at one with saying he walks at sea. Risum teneatis amici? Correct it, as I doubt not it ought to be, vexatus. Scriblerus. Books and the Man I sing, the first who brings Remarks. V. 2. The Smithfield Muses.] Smithfield is the place where Bartholomew Fair was kept, whose shews, machines, and dramatical entertainments, formerly agreeable only to the taste of the Rabble, were, by the Hero of this poem and others of equal genius, brought to the Theatres of Covent-Garden, Lincolns-Inn-Fields, and the Hay-Market, to be the reigning pleasures of the Court and Town. This happened in the year 1725, and continued many years. See Book 3. Verse 227, &amp;c.The Smithfield Muses to the Ear of Kings. Imitations.V. 3 Say great Patricians! since your selves inspire These wond'rous Works—] Ovid. Met 1. ? Dü cæptis (nam vos mutastis &amp; illas.)Say great Patricians! (since your selves inspire These wond'rous works: so Jove and Fate require) Say from what cause, in vain decry'd and curst, Imitations. V. 6. Alluding to a verse of Mr. Dryden, And Tom the second reigns like Tom the first.Still Dunce the second reigns like Dunce the first. In eldest time, e'er mortals writ or read, E're Pallas issu'd from the Thund'rer's head, Dulness o'er all possess'd her antient right, Remarks. V. 10. Daughter of Chaos, &amp;c.] The beauty of this whole Allegory being purely of the poetical kind, we think it not our proper business as a Scholiast to meddle with it, but to leave it (as we shall in general all such) to the reader: remarking only, that Chaos (according to Hesiod's ???????) was the Progenitor of all the Gods. Scribl.Daughter of Chaos and eternal Night: Fate in their dotage this fair ideot gave, Gross as her sire, and as her mother grave, Laborious, heavy, busy, bold, and blind, She rul'd in native Anarchy, the mind. Still her old empire to confirm, she tries, For born a Goddess, Dulness never dies. O Thou! whatever Title please thine ear, Dean, Drapier, Bickerstaff, or Gulliver, Whether thou chuse Cervantes' serious air, Or laugh and shake in Rab'lais easy Chair, Remarks. V. 21. Or praise the Court, or magnify Mankind.] Ironice, alluding to Gulliver's representations of both— The next line relates to the papers of the Drapier against the currency of Wood's Copper Coin in Ireland, which upon the great discontent of the people, his Majesty was graciously pleased to recal.Or praise the Court, or magnify Mankind, Or thy griev'd Country's copper chains unbind; Remarks. V. 23. From thy Bæotia.] Bæotia of old lay under the raillery of the neighbouring Wits, as Ireland does now; tho' each of those nations produced one of the greatest Wits, and greatest Generals, of their age.From thy Bæotia tho' Her Pow'r retires, Remarks. V. 24. Grieve not my Swift! at ought our realm acquires.] Ironicè iterum. The politicks of England and Ireland were at this time thought to be opposite, or interfering with each other: Dr. Swift of course was in the interest of the latter, our Author of the former.Grieve not, my Swift at ought our realm acquires, Here pleas'd behold her mighty wings out-spread, Remarks. V. 26. A new Saturnian Age of Lead.] The ancient golden Age is by Poets stiled Saturnian; but in the chymical language, Saturn is Lead.To hatch a new Saturnian Age of Lead. Remarks. V. 27 Where wave the tatter'd Ensigns of Rag-fair.] Rag-fair is a place near the Tower of London, where old cloaths and frippery are sold.Where wave the tatter'd ensigns of Rag-fair, Remarks. V. 28, 31. A yawning ruin hangs and nods in air— Here in one Bed two shiv'ring Sisters lie, The Cave of Poverty and Poetry. ] Hear upon this place the forecited Critic on the Dunciad. “These lines (saith he) have no construction or are nonsense. The two shivering sisters must be the sister-caves of Poverty and Poetry, or the bed and cave of Poverty and Poetry must be the same, (questionless, if they lie in one bed) and the two sisters the lord knows who?” O the construction of grammatical heads! Virgil writeth thus: Æn. 1. Fronte sub adversa scopulis pendentibus antrum: Intus aquæ dulces, vivoque sedilia saxo; Nympharum domus. ? May we not say in like manner, “The nymphs must be the waters and the stones, or the waters and the stones must be the houses of the nymphs?” Insulse! The second line, Intus aquæ, &amp;c. is in a parenthesis (as are the two lines of our Author, Keen hollow winds, &amp;c.) and it is the Antrum, and the yawning ruin, in the line before that parenthesis, which are the Domus and the Cave. Let me again, I beseech thee, Reader, present thee with another Conjectural Emendation on Virgil's scopulis pendentibus: He is here describing a place, whither the weary Marriners of Æneas repaired to dress their dinner.—Fessi—frugesq; receptas Et torrere parant flammis: What has scopulis pendentibus here to do? indeed the aquæ dulces and sedilia are something; sweet waters to drink, and seats to rest on: the other is surely an error of the Copyists. Restore it, without the least scruple, Populis prandentibus. Scriblerus.A yawning ruin hangs and nods in air; Keen, hollow winds howl thro' the bleak recess, Emblem of Music caus'd by Emptiness. Here in one bed two shiv'ring Sisters lye, The Cave of Poverty and Poetry. Remarks. V. 33. The Great Mother.] Magna mater, here apply'd to Dulness. The Quidnunc's, a name given to the ancient members of certain political clubs, who were constantly enquiring, quid nunc? what news? Imitations. V. 33 This the Great Mother, &amp;c.] Æn. 1. Urbs antiqua fuit ? Quam Juno fertur terris magis omnibus unam Posthabita coluisse Samo; hic illius arma, Hic currus fuit: hic regnum Dea gentibus esse (Siqua fata sinant) jam tum tenditq; sovetq;This, the Great Mother dearer held than all The clubs of Quidnunc's, or her own Guild-hall. Here stood her Opium, here she nurs'd her Owls, And destin'd here the imperial seat of fools. Hence springs each weekly Muse, the living boast Remarks. V. 38. Curl's chaste press, and Lintot's rubrick post.] Two Booksellers, of whom see Book 2. The former was fined by the Court of King's Bench for publishing obscene books; the latter usually adorn'd his shop with titles in red letters.Of Curl's chaste press, and Lintot's rubric post, Remarks. V. 39. Hence hymning Tyburn's elegiac lay.] It is an ancient English custom for the Malefactors to sing a Psalm at their execution at Tyburn; and no less customary to print Elegies on their deaths, at the same time, or before. Imitations. V. 39. Hence hymning Tyburn—Hence, &amp;c.] ?Genus unde Latinum Albaniq; patres, atq; altæ mœnia Romæ. Virg. ibid.Hence hymning Tyburn's elegiac lay, Remarks. V. 40. and 42. allude to the annual songs composed to music on St. Cecilia's Feast, and those made by the Poet-Laureat for the time being, to be sung at Court on every New-years-day, the words of which are happily drown'd in the voices and instruments.Hence the soft sing-song on Cecilia's day, Remarks. V. 41. Is a just satire on the Flatteries and Falsehoods admitted to be inscribed on the walls of Churches in Epitaphs. I must not here omit a Reflection, which will occur perpetually through this poem, and cannot but greatly endear the Author to every attentive observer of it: I mean that Candour and Humanity which every where appears in him to those unhappy objects of the ridicule of all mankind, the bad poets. He here imputes all scandalous rhimes, scurrilous weekly papers, lying news, base flatteries, wretched elegies, songs and verses (even from those sung at Court, to ballads in the streets) not so much to malice or servility, as to dulness; and not so much to dulness, as to necessity; And thus at the very commencement of his satire, makes an apology for all that are to be satirized.Sepulchral Lyes, our holy walls to grace, And New-year Odes, and all the Grubstreet race.

Within the chambers of the globe they spy The beds where sleeping vegetables lie, 'Till the glad summons of a genial ray Unbinds the glebe, and calls them out to dayHere she beholds the Chaos dark and deep, Where, nameless Somethings in their causes sleep, Till genial Jacob, or a warm Third-day Call forth each mass, a poem, or a play: How hints, like spawn, scarce quick in embryo lie, How new-born nonsense first is taught to cry, Maggots half-form'd, in rhyme exactly meet, And learn to crawl upon poetic feet. Remarks. V. 61. Here one poor Word a hundred clenches makes.] It may not be amiss to give an instance or two of these operations of Dulness out of the works of her Sons celebrated in the poem. A great Critic formerly held these clenches in such abhorrence, that he declared, “he that would pun, would pick a pocket.” Yet Mr. Dennis's works affords us notable examples in this kind. “Alexander Pope hath sent abroad into the world as many Bulls as his namesake Pope Alexander.”—Let us take the initial and final letters of his Name, viz. A. P?E, and they give you the idea of an Ape.—Pope comes from the Latin word Popa, which signifies a little Wart; or from poppysma, because he was continually popping out squibs of wit, or rather Popysmata, or Po-pisms,” Dennis on Hom. and Daily Journal June 11, 1728.Here one poor word a hundred clenches makes, Imitations.

Remarks. V. 71. Ægypt glads with show'rs.] In the lower Ægypt Rain is of no use, the overflowing of the Nile being sufficient to impregnate the soil.—These six verses represent the inconsistencies in the description of poets, who heap together all glittering and gawdy images, tho' incompatible in one season, or in one scene.—See the Guardian, No. 40. parag. 6.

But liv'd, in Settle's numbers, one day more.] A beautiful manner of speaking, usual with poets in praise of poetry, in which kind nothing is finer than those lines of Mr. Addison. Sometimes misguided by the tuneful throng, I look for streams immortaliz'd in song, That lost in silence and oblivion lye, Dumb are their fountains, and their channels dry, Yet run for ever by the Muses skill, And in the smooth description murmur still. Remarks. V. 88. But liv'd in Settle's numbers one day more.] Settle was alive at this time, and poet to the City of London. His office was to compose yearly panegyricks upon the Lord Mayors, and verses to be spoken in the Pageants: but that part of the shows being frugally at length abolish'd, the employment of City-Poet ceas'd; so that upon Settle's demise, there was no successor to that place. This important point of time our Poet has chosen as the Crisis of the Kingdom of Dulness, who thereupon decrees to remove her Imperial Seat; To which great enterprize, all things being now ripe, she calls the Hero of this poem. Mr. Settle was once a writer in some vogue, particularly with his party; for he was the Author or publisher of many noted pamphlets in the time of King Charles the second. He answer'd all Dryden's political poems; and being cry'd up on one side, succeeded not a little in his Tragedy of the empress of Morocco (the first that was ever printed with cuts.) “Upon this he grew insolent, the Wits writ against his Play, he replied, and the Town judged he had the better. In short Settle was then thought a formidable rival to Mr. Dryden; and not only the Town, but the University of Cambridge was divided which to prefer; and in both places the younger sort inclined to Elkanab.” Dennis, Pref. to Rem. on Hom. For the latter part of his history, see the Note on the third Book, verse 279.But liv'd, in Settle's numbers, one day more. Now May'rs and Shrieves all hush'd and satiate lay, Yet eat, in dreams, the custard of the day; While pensive Poets painful vigils keep, Sleepless themselves to give their readers sleep.

Old Pryn in restless Daniel.] The first edition had it, She saw in Norton all his father shine; a great mistake! for Daniel de Foe had parts, but Norton de Foe was a wretched writer, and never attempted Poetry. Much more justly is Daniel himself made successor to W. Pryn, both of whom wrote Verses as well as Politicks; as appears by the poem De jure divino, &amp;c. of De Foe, and by these lines in Cowley's Miscellanies of the other. ?

And Eusden eke out, &amp;c.] Lawrence Eusden, Poet Laureate: Mr. Jacob gives a catalogue of some few only of his works, which were very numerous. Mr. Cook in his Battle of Poets, saith of him. Eusden, a laurel'd Bard, by fortune rais'd, By very few was read, by fewer prais'd. Mr. Oldmixon in his Arts of Logic and Rhetoric, p. 413, 414. affirms, “That of all the Galimatia's he ever met with, none comes up to some verses of this Poet, which have as much of the Ridiculum and the Fustian in 'em as can well be jumbled together, and are of that sort of nonsense which so perfectly confounds all Idea's, that there is no distinct one left in the mind. Further he says of him, that he hath prophecy'd his own poetry shall be sweeter than Catullus, Ovid, and Tibullus, but we have little hope of the accomplishment of it from what he hath lately publish'd.” Upon which Mr. Oldmixon has not spar'd a reflection, “That the putting the Laurel on the head of one who writ such verses, will give futurity a very lively idea of the Judgment and justice of those who bestow'd it.” Ibid. p. 417. But the well-known learning of that Noble Person who was then Lord Chamberlain, might have screen'd him from this unmannerly reflection. Mr. Eusden was made Laureate for the same reason that Mr. Tibbald was made Hero of This Poem, because there was no better to be had. Nor ought Mr. Oldmixon to complain, so long after, that the Laurel would better have become his own brows, or any other's: It were more decent to acquiesce in the opinion of the Duke of Buckingham upon this matter. —In rush'd Eusden, and cry'd, Who shall have it, But I the true Laureate to whom the King gave it? Apollo begg'd pardon, and granted his claim, But vow'd, that till then he ne'er heard of his name. Session of Poets. Of Blackmoore, see book 2. verse 256. Of Philips, book 3. verse 322. Nabum Tate was Poet-Laureate, a cold writer, of no invention, but sometimes translated tolerably when befriended by Mr. Dryden. In his second part of Absalom and Achitophel are above two hundred admirable lines together of that great hand, which strongly shine through the insipidity of the rest. Something parallel may be observed of another Author here mention'd.And Eusden eke out Blackmore's endless line; She saw slow Philips creep like Tate's poor page, Remarks. V. 104. And all the Mighty Mad.] This is by no means to be understood literally, as if Mr. Dennis were really mad, according to the Narrative of Dr. Norris in Swift and Pope's Miscellanies, vol. 3. No—it is spoken of that Excellent and Divine Madness, so often mention'd by Plato, that poetical rage and enthusiasm, with which Mr. D. hath, in his time, been highly possessed; and of those extraordinary hints and motions whereof he himself so feelingly treats in his preface to the Rem. on Pr. Arth. [See notes on book 2. verse 256.] Scribl. Remarks. V. 104. And all the Mighty Mad in Dennis rage.] Mr. Theobald in the Censor, vol. 2, No 33. calls Mr. Dennis by the name of Furius. “The modern Furius is to be look'd on as more the object of pity, than of that which he daily provokes, laughter and contempt. Did we really know how much this poor man (I wish that reflection on poverty had been spared) suffers by being contradicted, or which is the same thing in effect, by hearing another praised: we should in compassion sometimes attend to him with a silent nod, and let him go away with the triumphs of his ill nature.—Poor Furius (again) when any of his contemporaries are spoken well of, quitting the ground of the present dispute, steps back a thousand years to call in the succour of the Ancients. His very panegyrick is spiteful, and he uses it for the same reason as some Ladies do their commendations of a dead beauty, who never would have had their good word, but that a living one happened to be mentiond in their company. His applause is not the tribute of his Heart, but the sacrifice of his Revenge,” &amp;c. Indeed his pieces against our Poet are somewhat of an angry character, and as they are now scarce extant, a taste of his stile may be satisfactory to the curious. “A young squab, short gentleman, whose outward form though it should be that of downright monkey, would not differ so much from human shape, as his unthinking immaterial part does from human understanding.—He is as stupid and as venomous as a hunchbacked toad—A book through which folly and ignorance, those brethren so lame and impotent, do ridiculously look very big, and very dull, and strut, and hobble cheek by jowl, with their arms on kimbo, being led and supported, and bully-backed by that blind Hector, Impudence.” Reflect. on the Essay on Crit. pag. 26, 29, 30. It would be unjust not to add his reasons for this Fury, they are so strong and so coercive. “I regard him (saith he) as an Enemy, not so much to me, as to my King, to my Country, to my Religion, and to that Liberty which has been the sole felicity of my life. A vagary of fortune, who is sometimes pleased to be frolicksome, and the epidemic Madness of the times, have given him Reputation, and Reputation (as Hobbs says) is Power, and that has made him dangerous. Therefore I look on it as my duty to King George, whose faithful subject I am; to my Country, of which I have appeared a constant lover; to the Laws, under whose protection I have so long lived; and to the Liberty of my Country, more dear than life to me, of which I have now for forty years been a constant asserter, &amp;c. I look upon it as my duty, I say, to do—you shall see what—to pull the lion's skin from this little Ass, which popular error has thrown round him; and to shew, that this Author who has been lately so much in vogue, has neither sense in his thoughts, nor english in his expressions.” Dennis. Rem. on Hom. Pref. p. 2. and p. 91, &amp;c. Besides these publick-spirited reasons, Mr. D. had a private one; which by his manner of expressing it in page 92, appears to have been equally strong. He was even in bodily fear of his life from the machinations of the said, Mr. P. “The story (says he) is too long to be told, but who would be acquainted with it, may hear it from Mr. Curl my Bookseller.—However, what my reason has suggested to me, that I have with a just confidence said, in defiance of his two clandestine weapons, his Slander and his Poyson.” Which last words of his book plainly discover, Mr. D. his suspicion was that of being poysoned, in like manner as Mr. Curl had been before him. Of which fact, see A full and true account of a horrid and barbarous revenge by poyson on the body of Edmund Curl; printed in 1716, the year antecedent to that wherein these Remarks of Mr. Dennis were published. But what puts it beyond all question, is a passage in a very warm treatise in which Mr. D. was also concerned, price two-pence, called, A true character of Mr. Pope and his writings, printed for S. Popping, 1716, in the tenth page whereof he is said, “to have insulted people on those calamities and diseases, which he himself gave them by administring Poyson to them:” and is called (p. 4.) “a lurking way-laying coward, and a stabber in the dark.” Which (with many other things most lively set forth in that piece) must have render'd him a terror, not to Mr. Dennis only, but to all christian people. For the rest, Mr. John Dennis was the son of a Sadler in London, born in 1657. He paid court to Mr. Dryden; and having obtained some correspondence with Mr. Wycherly and Mr. Congreve, he immediately obliged the publick with their Letters. He made himself known to the Government by many admirable schemes and projects; which the Ministry, for reasons best known to themselves, constantly kept private. For his character as a writer, it is given us as follows. “Mr. Dennis is excellent at pindarick writings, perfectly regular in all his performances, and a person of sound Learning. That he is master of a great deal of Penetration and Judgment, his criticisms (particularly on Prince Arthur) do sufficiently demonstrate.” From the same account it also appears, that he writ Plays “more to get Reputation than Money.” Dennis of himself. See Giles Jacob's Lives of Dram. Poets, page 68, 69. compared with page 286.And all the mighty Mad in Dennis rage. In each she marks her image full exprest, Remarks. V. 106. But chief in Tibbald.] Lewis Tibbald (as pronounced) or Theobald (as written) was bred an Attorney, and son to an Attorney (says Mr. Jacob) of Sittenburn in Kent. He was Author of many forgotten Plays, Poems, and other pieces, and of several anonymous Letters in praise of them in Mist's Journal, He was concern'd in a Paper call'd the Censor, and a translation of Ovid, as we find from Dennis's remarks on Pope's Homer, p. 9. 10. “There is a notorious Idiot, one hight Whachum, who from an-under-spur-leather to the Law, is become an understrapper to the Play-house, who has lately burlesqu'd the Metamorphoses of Ovid by a vile translation, &amp;c. This fellow is concern'd in an impertinent Paper called the Censor.” But notwithstanding this severe character, another Critic says of him, “That he has given us some pieces which met with approbation: and that the Cave of Poverty is an excellent Poem.” Jacob Lives of the Poets, vol. 2. p. 211. He had once a mind to translate the Odyssey, the first book whereof was printed in 1717, by B. Lintot, and probably may yet be seen at his shop. What is still in memory is a piece printed in 4to, 1726; it had the title of Shakspear Restored: Of this he was so proud himself, as to say in one of Mist's Journals, June 8. “That to expose any errors in it was impracticable.” And in another, April 27. “That whatever care might for the future be taken either by Mr. P. or any other assistants, he would still give above 500 emendations that shall escape them all.” During two whole years while Mr. Pope was preparing his edition, he publish'd Advertisements, requesting assistance, and promising satisfaction to any who could contribute to its greater perfection. But this Restorer, who was at that time solliciting favours of him by letters, did wholly conceal that he had any such design, till after its publication: (which he was since not asham'd to own, in a Daily Journal of Nov. 26. 1728.) And then an outcry was made in the Prints, that our Author had joined with the Bookseller to raise an extravagant subscription; in which he had no share, of which he had no knowledge, and against which he had publickly advertised in his own Proposals for Homer. Probably that proceeding elevated Tibbald to the dignity he holds in this Poem, which he seems to deserve no other way better than his brethren; unless we impute it to the share he had in the Journals, cited among the Testimonies of Authors prefix'd to this work. Remarks. V. 106.—monster-breeding breast.] This alludes to the extravagancy of the Farces of that author; in which he alone could properly be represented as successor to Settle, who had written Pope Joan, St. George for England, and other pieces for Bartlemew-Fair. See book 3. p. 279.But chief, in Tibbald's monster-breeding breast; Sees Gods with Dæmons in strange league ingage, And earth, and heav'n, and hell her battles wage. Remarks.V. 109.—supperless he sate.] It is amazing how the sense of this has been mistaken by all the former Commentators, who most idly suppose it to imply that the Hero of the Poem wanted a supper. In truth a great absurdity! Not that we are ignorant that the Hero of Homer's Odyssey is frequently in that circumstance, and therefore it can no way derogate from the grandeur of Epic Poem to represent such Hero under a calamity, to which the greatest not only of Critics and Poets, but of Kings and Warriors, have been subject. But much more refin'd, I will venture to say, is the meaning of our author: It was to give us obliquely a curious precept, or what Bossu calls a disguised sentence, that “Temperance is the life of Study.” The language of Poesy brings all into action; and to represent a Critic encompass'd with books, but without a supper, is a picture which lively expresseth how much the true Critic prefers the diet of the mind to that of the body, one of which he always castigates and often totally neglects, for the greater improvement of the other. Scriblerus.She ey'd the Bard, where supperless he sate, And pin'd, unconscious of his rising fate; Studious he sate, with all his books around, Sinking from thought to thought, a vast profound!

Round he throws his eyes That witness'd huge affliction and dismay.

V. 117. Volumes, whose size, &amp;c.] This library is divided into two parts; the one (his polite learning) consists of those books which seem to be the models of his poetry, and are prefer'd for one of these three reasons (usual with collectors of Libraries) that they fitted the shelves, or were gilded for shew, or adorned with pictures: The other class our author calls solid learning: old bodies of Philosophy, old Commentators, old english Printers, or old english Translations; all very voluminous, and fit to erect Altars to Dulness.Volumes, whose size the space exactly fill'd, Or which fond authors were so good to gild, Or where, by sculpture made for ever known, Imitations.V. 120.—admires new beauties not its own.] Virg.

He since published an edition of Shakespear, with alterations of the Text, upon bare conjectures either of his own, or any others who sent them to him, to which Mr. Mallet alludes in these verses of his excellent Poem on Verbal Criticism, He with low industry goes gleaning on, From good, from bad, from mean, neglecting none: His brother Bookworm so, on shelf or stall, Will feed alike on Woolston and on Paul— Such the grave bird in northern seas is found, (Whose name a Dutchman only knows to sound) Where'er the king of fish moves on before, This humble friend attends from shore to shore; With eye still earnest, and with bill declin'd, He picks up what his patron drops behind; With such choice cates his palate to regale, And is the careful Tibbald of a whale.And crucify poor Shakespear once a week. For thee I dim these eves, and stuff this head, Remarks. V. 166. With all such reading as was never read] Such as Caxton above-mention'd, the three destructions of Troy by Wynkin, and other like classicks.With all such reading as was never read; For thee supplying, in the worst of days, Remarks. V. 168. Notes to dull books, and prologues to dull plays.] As to Cook's Hesiod, where sometimes a note, and sometimes even half a note, are carefully owned by him: And to Moore's Comedy of the Rival Modes, and other authors of the same rank: These were people who writ about the year 1726.Notes to dull books, and prologues to dull plays; For thee explain a thing till all men doubt it, And write about it, Goddess, and about it; So spins the silk-worm small its slender store, And labours, 'till it clouds itself all o'er. Not that my quill to Critiques was confin'd, My Verse gave ampler lessons to mankind; So gravest precepts may successless prove, But sad examples never fail to move. Remarks. V. 177. As forc'd from wind-guns.] The Thought of these four verses is found in a poem of our author's of a very early date (namely writ at fourteen years old, and soon alter printed, To the author of a poem call'd Successio,) where they stand thus, The heaviest Muse the swiftest course has gone, As clocks run fastest when most lead is on. —So forc'd from engines lead itself can fly, And pond'rous slugs move nimbly thro' the sky.As forc'd from wind-guns, lead itself can fly, And pond'rous slugs cut swiftly thro' the sky: As clocks to weight their nimble motion owe, The wheels above urg'd by the load below; Me, emptiness and dulness could inspire, And were my clasticity and fire. Imitations.V. 183. Had heav'n decreed such works a longer date, &amp;c.] Virg. Æn. 2.

But see great Settle to the dust descend, And all thy cause and empire at an end! Imitations. V. 187. Could Troy be sav'd—His gray-goose weapon.] Virg. ibid ? Si Pergama dextra Defendi possent, etiam hac defensa fuissent.Cou'd Troy be sav'd by any single hand, His gray-goose weapon must have made her stand. Remarks. V. 189. My Flaccus.] A familiar manner of speaking used by modern critics of a favourite author. Mr. T. might as justly speak thus of Horace, as a French wit did of Tully, seeing his works in a library. Ah! mon cher Ciceron! Je le connois bien: o'est le meme qut Marc Tulle.But what can I? my Flaccus cast aside, Remarks. V. 190. Take up th'Attorney's Guide.] In allusion to his first profession of an Attorney.Take up th'Attorney's (once my better) guide? Remarks. V. 191. Or rob the Roman geese, &amp;c.] Relates to the well-known story of the geese that saved the Capitol, of which Virgil, Æn. 8. Atque hic auratis volitans argenteus anser Porticibus, Gallos in limine adesse canebat. a passage I have always suspected. Who sees not the antithesis of auratis and argenteus to be unworthy the Virgilian majesty? and what absurdity to say a goose sings? canebat. Virgil gives a contrary Character of the voice of this silly bird in Ec. 9. ? argutos interstrepere anser olores Read it therefore adesse strepebat. And why auratis porticibus? does not the very verse preceding this inform us, Romuleoque recens horrebat regia culmo. Is this thatch in one line, and gold in another, consistent? I scruple not (repugnantibus omnibus manuscriptis) to correct it, auritis. Horace uses the same epithet in the same sense, ? Auritas fidibus canoris Ducere quercus. And to say that walls have ears is common even to a proverb. Scribl.Or rob the Roman geese of all their glories, And save the state by cackling to the Tories? Yes, to my Country I my pen consign, Remarks. V. 194. Mighty Mist!] Nathaniel Mist was publisher of a famous Tory paper (see notes on 1.3) in which this author was sometimes permitted to have a part.Yes, from this moment, mighty Mist! am thine, And rival, Curtius! of thy fame and zeal, O'er head and ears plunge for the publick weal.

Adieu my children!] This is a tender and passionate apostrophe to his own works which he is going to sacrifice, agreeable to the nature of man in great affliction, and reflecting like a parent on the many miserable fates to which they would otherwise be subject.Adieu my children! better thus expire Unstall'd, unsold, thus glorious mount in fire Fair without spot; than greas'd by grocer's hands, Remarks.V. 200. Or ship'd with Ward to ape and monkey lands.] “Edward Ward, a very voluminous poet in hudibrastic verse, but best known by the London Spy, in prose. He has of late years kept a publick house in the City (but in a genteel way) and with his wit, humour, and good liquor (Ale) afforded his guests a pleasurable entertainment, especially those of the high-church party.” Jacob Lives of Poets, vol. 2 p. 225. Great numbers of his works were yearly sold into the plantations. Ward in a book call'd Apollo's Maggot, declar'd this account to be a great falsity, protesting that his publick house was not in the City, but in Moorfields.Or ship'd with Ward to ape and monkey lands, Or wafting ginger, round the streets to go, Imitations.

Now flames old Memnon, now Rodrigo burns, In one quick flash see Proserpine expire.] Memnon, a hero in the Persian Princess, very apt to take fire, as appears by these lines with which he begins the play, By heav'n it fires my frozen blood with rage, And makes it scald my aged trunk ? Rodrigo, the chief personage of the Perfidious Brother (a play written between T. and a Watchmaker.)

And last, his own cold Æschylus took fire.] He had been (to use an expression of our poet) about Æschylus for ten years, and had received subscriptions for the same, but then went about other books. The character of this tragic poet is fire and boldness in a high degree, but our author supposes it very much cooled by the translation: upon sight of a specimen of which was made this Epigram, Alas! poor Æschylus! unlucky dog! Whom once a lobster kill'd, and now a log. But this is a grievous error, for Æschylus was not slain by the fall of a lobster on his head, but of a tortoise. Teste Val. Max. l. 9. cap. 12. Scribl.And last, his own cold Æschylus took fire. Then gush'd the tears, as from the Trojan's eyes Remarks. V. 212. When the last blaze sent Ilion to the skies.] See Virgil Æn. 2. where I would advise the reader to peruse the story of Troy's destruction, rather than in Wynkin. But I caution him alike in both, to beware of a most grievous error, that of thinking it was brought about by I know not what Trojan Horse; there never having been any such thing. For first it was not Trojan, being made by the Greeks, and secondly it was not a horse, but a mare. This is clear from many verses in Virgil, Uterum armato milite complent ? Inclusos utero Danaos ? Can a horse be said Utero gerere? Again, Uteroque recusso Insonuere cavæ ? Atque utero sonitum quater arma dedere. Nay is it not expresly said, Scandit fatalis machina muros Fœta armis ? How is it possible the word fœta can agree with a horse? and indeed can it be conceived, that the chaste and virgin Goddess Pallas would employ her self in forming and fashioning the Male of that species? But this shall be prov'd to a demonstration in our Virgil Restored. Scribler.When the last blaze sent Ilion to the skies. Rowz'd by the light, old Dulness heav'd the head; Remarks. V. 214. Thulè] An unfinished poem of that name, of which one sheet was printed fifteen years ago; by Amb. Phillips, a northern author. It is an usual memethod of putting out a fire, to cast wet sheets upon it: Some critics have been of opinion, that this sheet was of the nature of the Asbestos, which cannot be consumed by fire; but I rather think it only an allegorical allusion to the coldness and heaviness of the writing.Then snatch'd a sheet of Thulè from her bed, Sudden she flies, and whelms it o're the pyre.

V. 221.—the sacred dome.] The Cave of Poverty above-mention'd; where he no sooner enters, but he reconnoitres the place of his original; as Plato says the spirits shall do, at their entrance into the celestial regions. His dialogue of the Immortality of the soul was translated by T. In the familiar modern stile of Prithee Phædo, and For God's sake Socrates: printed for B. Lintot, 1713.She bids him wait her to the sacred Dome; Well-pleas'd he enter'd, and confess'd his home: So Spirits ending their terrestrial race, Ascend and recognize their native place. Raptur'd, he gazes round the dear retreat, Remarks. V. 226. And in sweet numbers celebrates the seat.] He writ a poem call'd the Cave of Poverty, which concludes with a very extraordinary wish, “That some great genius, or man of distinguish'd merit may be starved, in order to celebrate her power, and describe her cave.” It was printed in octavo, 1715.And in sweet numbers celebrates the seat. Here to her Chosen all her works she shews; Prose swell'd to verse, Verse loitring into prose; How random thoughts now meaning chance to find, Now leave all memory of sense behind: How prologues into prefaces decay, And these to notes are fritter'd quite away. How index-learning turns no student pale, Yet holds the eel of science by the tail. How, with less reading than makes felons 'scape, Less human genius than God gives an ape, Small thanks to France, and none to Rome or Greece, A past, vamp'd, future, old, reviv'd, new piece, 'Twixt Plautus, Fletcher, Congreve, and Corneille, Remarks. V. 240. Can make a Cibber.] “Mr. Colly Cibber, an author and actor of a good share of wit, and uncommon vivacity, which are much improved by the conversation he enjoys, which is of the best.” Jacob Lives of Dram. Poets, p. 38. Besides two volumes of plays in 4to, he has made up and translated several others. Mr. Jacob omitted to remark, that he is particularly admirable in Tragedy. Remarks. V. 240.—Johnson.] “Charles Johnson, famous for writing a play every season, and for being at Button's every day: he had probably thriven better in his vocation, had he been a small matter leaner: he may justly be called a martyr to obesity, and to have fallen a victim to the rotundity of his parts:” Charact. of the Times, p. 19. Some of his plays are, Love in a Forest (Shakespear's As you like it) Wife's Relief (Shirley's Gamester) The Victim (Racine's Iphigenia) The Sultaness (Racine's Bajazet, the prologue to which abused Dr. Arbuthnot, Mr. Pope, and Mr. Gay) The Cobler of Preston, his own. Remarks. V. 240.—Or Ozell.] “Mr. John Ozell, if we credit Mr. Jacob, did go to school in Leicestershire, where somebody left him something to live on, when he shall retire from business. He was designed to be sent to Cambridge in order for priesthood: but he chose rather to be placed in an office of accounts in the City, being qualified for the same by his skill in arithmetick, and writing the necessary hands. He has oblig'd the world with many translations of French plays.” Jacob Lives of Dram. Poets, p. 198. Mr. Jacob's character of Mr. Ozell, seems vastly short of his merits; and he ought to have further justice done him, having since fully confuted all Sarcasms on his learning and genius, by an advertisment of Sept. 20. 1729. in a paper call'd the Weekly Medley, &amp;c. “As to my learning, this envious wretch knew, and every body knows, that the whole bench of Bishops, not long ago, were pleas'd to give me a purse of guineas, for discovering the erroneous translations of the common-prayer in Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian, &amp;c. As for my genius, let Mr. Cleland shew better verses in all Pope's works than Ozell's version of Boileau's Latrin, which the late Lord Halifax was so pleas'd with, that he complimented him with leave to dedicate it to him, &amp;c. &amp;c. Let him shew better and truer poetry in the Rape of the Lock, than in Ozell's Rape of the Bucket, (la Secchia rapita) which, because an ingenious author happen'd to mention in the same breath with Pope's, viz. Let Ozell sing the Bucket, Pope the Lock, the little Gentleman had like to run mad.—And Mr. Toland and Mr. Gildon publickly declar'd, Ozell's translation of Homer to be, as it was prior, so likewise superior to Pope's.—Surely, surely, every man is free to deserve well of his country!

Gildon.] Charles Gildon, a writer of criticisms and libels of the last age, bred at St. Omer's with the Jesuits, but renouncing popery, he publish'd Blount's books against the divinity of Christ, the Oracles of Reason, &amp;c. He signaliz'd himself as a critic, having written some very bad plays; abused Mr. P. very scandalously in an anonymous pamphlet of the Life of Mr. Wycherley printed by Curl, in another called the New Rehearsal printed in 1714, in a third entitled the Compleat Art of English Poetry in two volumes, and others.Where wretched Withers, Banks, and Gildon rest, Remarks.

[These 6 verses were added in the latter Editions.]Impatient waits, till ? grace the quire. I see a Chief, who leads my chosen sons, All arm'd with points, antitheses and puns!

Schools, courts, and senates shall my laws obey, Till Albion, as Hibernia, bless my sway. She ceas'd: her owls responsive clap the wing, And Grubstreet garrets roar, God save the king. So when Jove's block descended from on high, Remarks. V. 262. As sings thy great fore-father, Ogilby.] See his Æsop. Fab. where this excellent hemystic is to be found. Our author manifests here and elsewhere, a prodigious tenderness for the bad writers. We see he selects the only good passage perhaps in all that ever Ogylby writ; which shows how candid and patient a reader he must have been. What can be more kind and affectionate than these words in the preface to his Poems, 4to. 1717. where he labours to call up all our humanity and forgiveness toward these unlucky men, by the most moderate representation of their case that has ever been given by any author? “Much may be said to extenuate the fault of bad poets: What we call a Genius is hard to be distinguish'd, by a man himself, from a prevalent inclination: And if it be never so great, he can at first discover it no other way than by that strong propensity, which renders him the more liable to be mistaken. He has no other method but to make the experiment by writing, and so appealing to the judgment of others: And if he happens to write ill (which is certainly no sin in itself) he is immediately made the object of ridicule! I wish we had the humanity to reflect, that even the worst authors might endeavour to please us, and in that endeavour, deserve something at our hands. We have no cause to quarrel with them, but for their obstinacy in persisting, and even that may admit of alleviating circumstances: For their particular friends may be either ignorant, or unsincere; and the rest of the world too well-bred to shock them with a truth which generally their booksellers are the first that inform them of.” But how much all indulgence is lost upon these people, may appear from the just reflection made on their constant conduct, and constant fate, in the following Epigram. Ye little wits, that gleam'd a while, When Pope vouchsaf'd a ray, Alas! depriv'd of his kind smile, How soon ye fade away! To compass Phœbus car about, Thus empty vapours rise; Each lends his cloud, to put him out That rear'd him to the Skies. Alas! those Skies are not your sphere; There, He shall ever burn: Weep, weep and fall! for Earth ye were, And must to Earth return.(As sings thy great forefather, Ogilby,) Loud thunder to its bottom shook the bog, And the hoarse nation croak'd, God save King Log The End of the First Book. [Book II.] Argument to Book the Second. The King being proclaimed, the solemnity is graced with publick games and sports of various kinds; not instituted by the Hero, as by Æneas in Virgil, but for greater honour by the Goddess in person (in like manner as the games Pythia, Isthmia, &amp;c. were anciently said to be by the Gods, and as Thetis herself appearing according to Homer Odyss. 24. proposed the prizes in honour of her son Achilles.) Hither flock the Poets and Criticks, attended, as is but just, with their Patrons and Booksellers. The Goddess is first pleased for her disport to propose games to the Booksellers, and setteth up the phantom of a Poet which they contend to overtake. The Races described, with their divers accidents: next, the Game for a Poetess: then follow the exercises for the Poets, of tickling, vociferating, diving: the first holds forth the arts and practices of Dedicators, the second of Disputants and fustian poets, the third of profound, dark, and dirty authors. Lastly, for the Critics, the Goddess proposes (with great propriety) an exercise not of their parts, but their patience; in hearing the works of two voluminous authors, one in verse and the other in prose, deliberately read, without sleeping: The various effects of which, with the several degrees and manners of their operation, are here set forth: till the whole number, not of critics only, but of spectators, actors, and all present fall fast asleep, which naturally and necessarily ends the games. Remarks on Book the Second. Two things there are, upon the supposition of which the very basis of all Verbal criticism is founded and supported: The first, that an Author could never fail to use the best word, on every occasion: The second, that a Critic cannot chuse but know, which that is? This being granted, whenever any word doth not fully content us, we take upon us to conclude, first that the author could never have us'd it, and secondly, that he must have used that very one which we conjecture in its stead. We cannot therefore enough admire the learned Scriblerus, for his alteration of the text in the two last verses of the preceding book, which in all the former editions stood thus, Hoarse thunder to the bottom shook the bog. And the loud nation croak'd, God save King Log! He has with great judgment transposed these two epithets, putting hoarse to the nation, and loud to the thunder: and this being evidently the true reading, he vouchsafed not so much as to mention the former; for which assertion of the just right of a Critic, he merits the acknowledgment of all sound commentators.

Henley's gilt Tub.] The pulpit of a dissenter is usually called a tub; but that of Mr. Orator Henley was covered with velvet, and adorned with gold. He had also a fair altar, and over it this extraordinary inscription, The Primitive Eucharist. See the history of this person, book 3. verse 195. Remarks. V. 2. Or Fleckno's Irish Throne.] Richard Fleckno was an Irish priest, but had laid aside (as himself expressed it) the mechanic part of priesthood. He printed some plays, poems, letters and travels. I doubt not our author took occasion to mention him in respect to the poem of Mr. Dryden, to which this bears some resemblance; tho' of a character more different from it than that of the Æneid from the Iliad, or the Lutrin of Boileau from the Defaits des Bouts rimeès of Sarazin. Henley's gilt tub, or Fleckno's Irish throne, Remarks. V. 3. Or that, where on her Curls the public pours.] Edm. Curl stood in the pillory at Charing-Cross, in March, 1727–8. Mr. Curl loudly complain'd of this note as an untruth, protesting, “that he stood in the pillory not in March but in February;” And of another on verse 144. “saying, he was not tost in a blanket, but a rug” Curliad in 120. 1729. p. 19 and 25.Or that, where on her Curls the public pours, All-bounteous, fragrant grains, and golden show'rs: Great Tibbald nods: The proud Parnassian sneer, The conscious simper, and the jealous leer, Mix on his look. All eyes direct their rays On him, and crowds grow foolish as they gaze. Not with more glee, by hands pontific crown'd, With scarlet hats, wide waving, circled round, Remarks.V. 11. Rome in her capitol saw Querno sit.] Camillo Querno was of Apulia, who hearing the great encouragement which Leo the tenth gave to poets, travell'd to Rome with a harp in his hand, and sung to it twenty thousand verses of a poem call'd Alexias. He was introduc'd as a buffoon to Leo, and promoted to the honour of the laurel; a jest, which the court of Rome and the pope himself enter'd into so far, as to cause him to ride on an elephant to the Capitol, and to hold a solemn festival on his coronation; at which it is recorded the poet himself was so transported, as to weep for joy. He was ever after a constant frequenter of the Pope's table, drank abundantly, and poured forth verses without number. Paulus Jovius, Elog. Virg. doct. ch. 82. Some idea of his poetry is given by Fam. Strada in his Prolusions. Rome in her capitol saw Querno sit, Thron'd on sev'n hills, the Antichrist of wit. To grace this honour'd day, the Queen proclaims By herald hawkers, high heroic games. She summons all her sons: An endless band Pours forth, and leaves unpeopled half the land; A motley mixture! in long wigs, in bags, In silks, in crapes, in garters, and in rags, From drawing rooms, from colleges, from garrets, On horse, on foot, in hacks, and gilded chariots, All who true dunces in her cause appear'd, And all who knew those dunces to reward. Amid that Area wide she took her stand, Where the tall May-pole once o'er look'd the Strand. But now, so Anne and Piety ordain, A church collects the saints of Drury-lane. With authors, Sationers obey'd the call, The field of glory is a field for all; Glory, and gain, th'industrious tribe provoke; And gentle Dulness ever loves a joke. Imitations. V. 31. A poet's form she plac'd before their eyes.] This is what Juno does to deceive Turnus, Æn. 10. Tum dea nube cava, tenuem sine viribus umbram, In faciem Æneæ (visu mirabile monstrum) Dardanii's ornat telis, clypeumque jubasque Divini assimilat capitis—Dat inania verba, Dat sine mente sonum ? The reader will observe how exactly some of these verses suit with their allegorical application here to a plagiary: There seems to me a great propriety in this Episode, where such an one is imag'd by a phantom that deludes the grasp of the expecting Bookseller.A Poet's form she plac'd before their eyes, And bad the nimblest racer seize the prize; No meagre, muse-rid mope, adust and thin, In a dun night-gown of his own loose skin, Imitations. V. 35. But such a bulk as no twelve bards.] Virg. 12. Vix illud lecti bis sex ? Qualia nunc hominum producit corporatellus.But such a bulk as no twelve bards could raise, Twelve starveling bards of these degen'rate days. All as a partridge plump, full-fed, and fair, She form'd this image of well-bodied air, With pert flat eyes she window'd well its head, A brain of feathers, and a heart of lead, And empty words she gave, and sounding strain, But senseless, lifeless! idol void and vain! Remarks. V. 43. Never was dash'd out, at one lucky hit.] Our author here seems willing to give some account of the possibility of Dulness making a Wit, (which could be done no other way than by chance.) The fiction is the more reconcil'd to probability by the known story of Apelles, who being at a loss to express the foam of Alexander's horse, dash'd his pencil in despair at the picture, and happen'd to do it by that fortunate stroke.Never was dash'd out, at one lucky hit, A fool, so just a copy of a wit; So like, that critics said, and courtiers swore, Remarks. V. 46. And call'd the phantom, More.] Curl in his key to the Dunciad, affirm'd this to be James Moore Smith, Esq; and it is probable (considering what is said of him in the Testimonies) that some might fancy our author obliged to represent this gentleman as a plagiary, or to pass for one himself. His case indeed was like that of a man I have heard of, who as he was sitting in company, perceived his next neighbour had stolen his handkerchief. “Sir (said the thief, finding himself detected) “do not expose me, I did it for mere want: be so good but to take it privately out of my pocket again, and say nothing.” The honest man did so, but the other cry'd out, “See gentlemen! what a thief we have among us! look, he is stealing my handkerchief.” The plagiarisms of this person gave occasion to the following Epigram: M?re always smiles whenever he recites; He smiles (you think) approving what he writes; And yet in this no Vanity is shown; A modest man may like what's not his own. His only work was a comedy call'd the Rival Modes; the town condemn'd it in the action, but he printed it in 1726–7 with this modest Motto, Hic cæstus, artemque repono. The smaller pieces which we have heard attributed to this author, are, An Epigram on the bridge at Blenheim, by Dr. Evans: Cosmelia, by Mr. Pit, Mr. Jones, &amp;c. The Saw-pit, a simile, by a Friend, and some unown'd letters, advertisements and epigrams against our author in the Daily Journal. Notwithstanding what is here collected of the person imagin'd by Curl to be meant in this place, we cannot be of that opinion; since our poet had certainly no need of vindicating half a dozen verses to himself which every reader had done for him; since the name itself is not spell'd Moore but More; and lastly, since the learned Scriblerus has so well prov'd the contrary. Remarks. V. 46. The phantom, More.] It appears from hence that this is not the name of a real person, but fictitious. More from ?????, stultus, ?????, stultitia, to represent the folly of a plagiary. Thus Erasmus: Admonuit me Mori cognomen tibi, quod tam ad Moriæ vocabulum accedit quam es ipse a re alienus. Dedication of Moriæ Encomion to Sir Tho. More; the farewel of which may be our author's to his plagiary, Vale More! &amp; Moriam tuam gnaviter defende. Adieu More, and be sure strongly to defend thy own folly. Scriblerus.A Wit it was, and call'd the phantom More. All gaze with ardour: some, a poet's name, Others, a sword-knot and lac'd suit inflame. Remarks. V. 49. But lofty Lintot.] We enter here upon the episode of the Booksellers: persons, whose names being more known and famous in the learned world than those of the Authors in this poem, do therefore need less explanation. The action of Mr. Lintot here imitates that of Dares in Virgil, rising just in this manner to lay hold on a Bull. This eminent Bookseller printed the Rival Modes above-mentioned.But lofty Lintot in the circle rose; “This prize is mine; who tempt it, are my foes: “With me began this genius, and shall end.” He spoke, and who with Lintot shall contend! Fear held them mute. Alone untaught to fear Remarks. V. 54. Stood dauntless Curl, &amp;c.] We come now to a character of much respect, that of Mr. Edmond Curl. As a plain repetition of great actions is the best praise of them, we shall only say of this eminent man, that he carried the Trade many lengths beyond what it ever before had arrived at, and that he was the envy and admiration of all his profession. He possess'd himself of a command over all authors whatever; he caus'd them to write what he pleas'd; they could not call their very names their own. He was not only famous among these; he was taken notice of by the State, the Church, and the Law, and received particular marks of distinction from each. It will be own'd that he is here introduc'd with all possible dignity; he speaks like the intrepid Diomed; he runs like the swift-footed Achilles; if he falls, 'tis like the beloved Nisus; and (what Homer makes to be the chief of all praises) he is favour'd of the Gods: He says but three words, and his prayer is heard; a Goddess conveys it to the seat of Jupiter: tho' he loses the prize, he gains the victory; the great Mother her self comforts him, she inspires him with expedients, she honours him with an immortal present (such as Achilles receives from Thetis and Æneas from Venus) at once instructive and prophetical: After this, he is unrival'd and triumphant. The tribute our author here pays him, is a grateful return for several unmerited obligations: Many weighty animadversions on the publick affairs, and many excellent and diverting pieces on private persons, has he given to his name. If ever he ow'd two verses to any other, he ow'd Mr. Curl some thousands. He was every day extending his fame, and enlarging his writings: witness innumerable instances! but it shall suffice only to mention the Court-Poems, which he meant to publish as the work of the true writer, a Lady of quality; but being first threaten'd, and afterwards punish'd for it by Mr. Pope, he generously transfer'd it from her to him, and ever since printed it in his name. The single time that ever he spoke to C. was on that affair, and to that happy incident he owes all the favours since received from him: So true is the saying of Dr. Sydenham, that “any one shall be, at some time or other, the better or the worse, for having but seen or spoken to a good or a bad man.” Imitations. V. 54. &amp;c. Something like this is in Homer Il. 10. ver. 220. of Diomed. Two different manners of the same author in his similies are also imitated in the two following; the first of the Bailiff is short, unadorn'd, and (as the Critics well know) from familiar life; the second of the Water-fowl more extended, picturesque, and from rural life. The 55th verse is likewise a literal translation of one in Homer.Stood dauntless Curl, “Behold that rival here! “The race by vigor, not by vaunts is won; Imitations. V. 56. So take the hindmost Hell.] Horace de Art. Occupet extremum scabies; mihi turpe relinqui est.“So take the hindmost Hell—He said, and run. Swift as a bard the bailiff leaves behind, He left huge Lintot, and out-strip'd the wind. As when a dab-chick waddles thro' the copse, Imitations. V. 60.] On feet, and wings, and flies, and wades, and hops; So lab'ring on, with shoulders, hands, and head. Milton, lib. 2. ? So eagerly the fiend O'er bog, o'er steep, thro' strait, rough, dense or rare, With head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way, And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.On feet, and wings, and flies, and wades, and hops; So lab'ring on, with shoulders, hands, and head, Wide as a windmill all his figure spread, With legs expanded Bernard urg'd the race, And seem'd to emulate great Jacob's pace. Full in the middle way there stood a lake, Remarks. V. 66. Curl's Corinna.] This name it seems was taken by one Mrs. T?, who procur'd some private letters of Mr. Pope's, while almost a boy, to Mr. Cromwell, and sold them without the consent of either of those gentlemen to Curl, who printed them in 120. 1727. He has discover'd her to be the publisher in his Key, p. 11. We only take this opportunity of mentioning the manner in which those letters got abroad, which the author was asham'd of as very trivial things, full not only of levities, but of wrong judgments of men and books, and only excusable from the youth and inexperience of the writer.Which Curl's Corinna chanc'd that morn to make: (Such was her won't, at early drawn to drop Her evening cates before his neighbour's shop,) Imitations. V. 69. Here fortun'd Curl to slide.] Virg. Æn. 5. of Nisus. Labitur infelix, cæsis ut forte juvencis Fusus humum viridesque supe, madefecer at herbas— Concidit, immundoque fimo, sacroque cruore.Here fortun'd Curl to slide; loud shout the band, Imitations. V. 70. And Bernard! Bernard!] Virg. Ecl. 6. ? Ut littus, Hyla, Hyla, omne sonaret.And Bernard! Bernard! rings thro' all the Strand. Remarks. V. 71. Obscene with filth, &amp;c.] Tho' this incident may seem too low and base for the dignity of an Epic poem, the learned very well know it to be but a copy of Homer and Virgil; the very words ????? and Fimus are used by them, tho' our poet (in compliance to modern nicety) has remarkably enrich'd and colour'd his language, as well as rais'd the versification in this Episode, and in the following one of Eliza. Mr. Dryden in Mack-Fleckno, has not scrupled to mention the Morning Toast at which the fishes bite in the Thames, Pissing-Alley, Reliques of the Bum, &amp;c. but our author is more grave, and (as a fine writer says of Virgil in his Georgics) tosses about his Dung with an air of majesty. If we consider that the exercises of his Authors could with justice be higher than tickling, chatt'ring, braying, or diving, it was no easy matter to invent such games as were proportion'd to the meaner degree of Booksellers. In Homer and Virgil, Ajax, and Nisus, the persons drawn in this plight are Heroes; whereas here they are such with whom it had been great impropriety to have join'd any but vile ideas; besides the natural connection there is between Libellers and common nusances. Nevertheless I have often heard our author own, that this part of his Poem was (as it frequently happens) what cost him most trouble and pleas'd him least: but that he hoped 'twas excusable, since levell'd at such as understand no delicate satire: Thus the politest men are sometimes obliged to swear, when they happen to have to do with porters and oyster-wenches.Obscene with filth the miscreant lies bewray'd, Fal'n in the plash his wickedness had laid: Then first (if poets aught of truth declare) The caitiff Vaticide conceiv'd a prayer. Hear Jove! whose name my bards and I adore, As much at least as any God's, or more; And him and his if more devotion warms, Remarks. V. 78.

There in his seat two spacious vents appear, On this he sits to that he leans his ear, And hears the various vows of fond mankind, Some beg an eastern; some a western wind: All vain petitions, mounting to the sky; With reams abundant this abode supply; Amus'd he reads, and then returns the bills Imitations.

See note on verse 46.His papers light, fly diverse, tost in air: Songs, sonnets, epigrams the winds uplift, And whisk 'em back to Evans, Younge, and Swift. Th'embroider'd suit, at least, he deem'd his prey; Remarks. V. 110. And unpay'd Taylor.] This line has been loudly complain'd of in Mist, June. 8. Dedic. to Sawney, and others, as a most inhuman satire on the poverty of poets: but it is thought our author would be acquitted by a jury of Taylors. To me this instance seems unluckily chosen; if it be a satire on any body, it must be on a bad paymaster, since the person to whom they have here apply'd it was a man of fortune. Not but poets may well be jealous of so great a prerogative as non-payment: which Mr. Dennis so far asserts: as boldly to pronounce, that “if Homer himself was not in debt, it was because no body would trust him. (Pref. to Rem. on the Rape of the Lock, p. 15.)That suit, an unpay'd taylor snatch'd away! No rag, no scrap, of all the beau, or wit, That once so flutter'd, and that once so writ. Heav'n rings with laughter: Of the laughter vain, Dulness, good Queen, repeats the jest again. Three wicked imps of her own Grubstreet choir Remarks. V. 116. Like Congreve, Addison, and Prior.] These authors being such whose names will reach posterity, we shall not give any account of them but proceed to those of whom it is necessary.—Besaleel Morris was author of some satires on the translators of Homer, with many, other things printed in news-papers.— “Bond writ a satire against Mr. P— Capt. Breval was author of The Confederates, an ingenious dramatic performance to expose Mr. P. Mr. Gay, Dr. Arb. and some ladies of quality, says Curl, Key, p. 11.She deck'd like Congreve, Addison and Prior; Remarks. V. 117. Mears, Warner, Wilkins.] Booksellers and Printers of much anonymous stuff. Mears, Warner, Wilkins run: delusive thought! Remarks. V. 118. Breval, Besaleel, Bond.] I foresee it will be objected from this line, that we were in an error in our assertion on verse 46. of this book, that More was a fictitious name, since these persons are equally represented, by the poet as phantoms. So at first sight it may seem; but be not deceived, reader! these also are not real persons. 'Tis true Curl declares Breval, a captain, author of a piece calld The Confederates: But the same Curl first said it was written by Joseph Gay: Is his second assertion to be credited any more than his first? He likewise affirms Bond to be one who writ a satire on our poet; but where is such a satire to be found? where was such a writer ever heard of? As for Besaleel, it carries forgery in the very name nor is it, as the others are, a surname. Thou may'st depend on it no such authors ever lived: all phantoms! Scriblerus. Breval, Besaleel, Bond, the varlets caught. Curl stretches after Gay, but Gay is gone, Remarks. V. 120. Joseph Gay, a fictitious name put by Curl before several pamphlets, which made them pass with many for Mr. Gay's.He grasps an empty Joseph for a John: So Proteus, hunted in a nobler shape, Became, when seiz'd, a puppy, or an ape. To him the Goddess. Son! thy grief lay down, Remarks. V. 124. And turn this whole illusion on the town.] It was a common practice of this bookseller, to publish vile pieces of obscure hands under the names of eminent authors.And turn this whole illusion on the town. As the sage dame, experienc'd in her trade, By names of Toasts retails each batter'd jade, (Whence hapless Monsieur much complains at Paris Of wrongs from Duchesses and Lady Mary's) Be thine, my stationer! this magic gift; Remarks. V. 130. Cook shall be Prior.] The man here specify'd was the son of a Muggletonian, who kept a publick house at Braintree in Essex. He writ a thing call'd The Battle of Poets, of which Philips and Welsted were the heroes, and wherein our author was attack'd in his moral character, in relation to his Homer and Shakespear: He writ moreover a Farce of Penelope, in the preface of which also he was squinted at, and some malevolent things in the British, London and Daily Journals. At the same time the honest gentleman wrote letters to Mr. Pope in the strongest terms protesting his innocence. His chief work was a translation of Hesiod, to which Theobald writ notes, and half-notes, as hath already been said. Remarks. V. ibid. And Concanen, Swift.] In the first edition of this poem there were only Asterisks in this place, but the names were since inserted, merely to fill up the verse, and give ease to the ear of the reader. Cook shall be Prior, and Concanen, Swift; So shall each hostile name become our own, Remarks. V. 132. And we too boast our Garth and Addison.] Nothing is more remarkable than our author's love of praising good writers. He has celebrated Sir Isaac Newton, Mr. Dryden, Mr. Congreve, Mr. Wycherley, Dr. Garth, Mr. Walsh, Duke of Buckingham, Mr. Addison, Lord Lansdown; in a word, almost every man of his time that deserv'd it. It was very difficult to have that pleasure in a poem on this subject, yet he found means to insert their panegyrick, and has made even dulness out of her own mouth pronounce it. It must have been particularly agreeable to him to celebrate Dr. Garth; both as his constant friend, and as he was his Predecessor in this kind of satire. The Dispensary attack'd the whole body of Apothecaries, a much more useful one undoubtedly than that of the bad poets (if in truth this can be call'd a body, of which no two members ever agreed.) It also did what Mr. Theobald says is unpardonable, drew in parts of private character, and introduced persons independent of his subject. Much more would Boileau have incurr'd his censure, who left all subjects whatever on all occasions, to fall upon the bad poets; (which it is to be fear'd would have been more immediately his concern.) But certainly next to commending good writers, the greatest service to learning is to expose the bad, who can only that one way be made of any use to it. This truth is very well set forth in these lines, address'd to our author. The craven Rook, and pert Jackdaw, (Tho' neither birds of moral kind) Yet serve, if hang'd, or stuff'd with straw, To show us, which way blows the wind.And we too boast our Garth and Addison. Imitations. V. 133.—piteous of his case, Yet smiling at his ruful length of face.) Virg. Æn. 5. ? Risit pater optimus illi. Me liceat casum miserare insontis amici ? Sic fatus, Gætuli tergum immane leonis, &amp;c. Thus dirty knaves, or chatt'ring fools, Strung up by dozens in thy lay, Teach more by half than Dennis' rules, And point instruction every way. With Ægypt's art thy pen may strive, One potent drop let this but shed, And ev'ry Rogue that stunk alive Becomes a precious Mummy dead.With that, she gave him (piteous of his case, Remarks. V. 134. Ruful length of face.] “The decrepid person or figure of a man are no reflections upon his Genius: An honest mind will love and esteem a man of worth, tho' he be deform'd or poor. Yet the author of the Dunciad hath libell'd a person for his ruful length of face!” Mist's Journ. June 8. This Genius and man of worth whom an honest mind should love, is Mr. Curl. True it is, he stood in the Pillory, an incident which will lengthen the face of any man tho' it were ever so comely, therefore is no reflection on the natural beauty of Mr. Curl. But as to reflections on any man's face, or figure, Mr. Dennis saith excellently; “Natural deformity comes not by our fault; 'tis often occasion'd by calamities and diseases, which a man can no more help, than a monster can his deformity. There is no one misfortune, and no one disease, but what all the rest of mankind are subject to.—But the deformity of this Author is visible, present, lasting, unalterable, and peculiar to himself. 'Tis the mark of God and Nature upon him, to give us warning that we should hold no society with him, as a creature not of our original, nor of our species: And they who have refused to take this warning which God and Nature have given them, and have in spite of it by a senseless presumption ventur'd to be familiar with him, have severely suffer'd, &amp;c. 'Tis certain his original is not from Adam, but from the Devil,” &amp;c. Dennis Charact. of Mr. P. 8vo. 1716. Admirably is it observ'd by Mr. Dennis against Mr. Law, p. 33. “That the language of Billingsgate can never be the language of Charity, nor consequently of Christianity.” I should else be tempted to use the language of a Critic: For what is more provoking to a commentator, than to behold his author thus portrayed? Yet I consider it really hurts not him; whereas maliciously to call some others dull, might do them prejudice with a world too apt to believe it. Therefore tho' Mr. D. may call another a little ass or a young toad, far be it from us to call him a toothless lion, or an old serpent. Indeed, had I written these notes, (as was once my intent) in the learned language, I might have given him the appellations of Balatro, Calceatum caput, Scurra in triviis, being phrases in good esteem and frequent usage among the best learned: But in our mother tongue, were I to tax any gentleman of the Dunciad, surely it should be in words not to the vulgar intelligible; whereby christian charity, decency, and good accord among authors, might be preserved. Scriblerus. The good Scriblerus here, as on all occasions, eminently shews his humanity. But it was far otherwise with the gentleman of the Dunciad, whose scurrilities were always personal, and of that nature which provoked every honest man but Mr. Pope, yet never to be lamented, since they occasion'd the following Amiable Verses. While Malice, Pope, denies thy page It's own celestial fire, While Critics, and while Bards in rage Admiring won't admire; While wayward pens thy worth assail, And envious tongues decry, These times tho' many a Friend bewail, These times bewail not I. But when the World's loud praise is thine, And spleen no more shall blame, When with thy Homer thou shalt shine In one establish'd fame. When none shall rail, and ev'ry lay Devote a wreath to thee; That day (for come it will) that day Shall I lament to see.Yet smiling at his ruful length of face.) Remarks. V. 135. A shaggy Tapst'ry.] A sorry kind of Tapestry frequent in old Inns, made of worsted or some coarser stuff: like that which is spoken of by Donne— Faces as frightful as theirs who whip Christ in old hangings. The imagery woven in it alludes to the mantle of Cloanthus, in Æn. 5.A shaggy tap'stry, worthy to be spread Remarks. V. 136 On Codrus' old, or Dunton's modern bed.] Of Codrus the poet's bed see Juvenal, describing his poverty very copiously. Sat. 3. v. 103, &amp;c. Lectus erat Codro, &amp;c. Codrus had but one bed, so short too boot, That his short Wife's short legs hung dangling out: His cupboard's head six earthen pitchers grac'd, Beneath them was his trusty tankard plac'd; And to support this noble plate, there lay A bending Chiron, cast from honest clay. His few Greek books a rotten chest contain'd, Whose covers much of mouldiness complain'd, Where mice and rats devour'd poetic bread, And on heroic Verse luxuriously were fed. 'Tis true, poor Codrus nothing had to boast, And yet poor Codrus all that nothing lost. Dryd. But Concanen in his dedication of the letters, advertisements, &amp;c. to the author of the Dunciad, assures us, that “Juvenal never satirized the poverty of Codrus. John Dunton was a broken bookseller and abusive scribler: he writ Neck or Nothing, a violent satire on some ministers of state; The danger of a death bed repentance, a libel on the Duke of Devonshire and on the Rt. Rev. Bishop of Peterborough, &amp;c.On Codrus' old, or Dunton's modern bed; Instructive work! whose wry mouth'd portraiture Display'd the sates her confessors endure.

He lived to the time of Queen Anne.And Tuchin flagrant from the scourge, below: Remarks. V. 141.

See in the circle next, Eliza plac'd.] In this game is expos'd in the most contemptuous manner the profligate licentiousness of those shameless scriblers (for the most part of that Sex, which ought least to be capable of such malice or impudence) who in libellous Memoirs and Novels, reveal the faults or misfortunes of both sexes, to the ruin of publick fame, or disturbance of private happiness. Our good poet, (by the whole cast of his work being obliged not to take off the Irony) where he could not shew his indignation, hath shewn his contempt, as much as possible: having here drawn as Vile a picture as could be represented in the colours of Epic poesy. Scriblerus. Remarks. V. 149. Eliza Haywood.] This woman was authoress of those most scandalous books, call'd The Court of Carimania, and The New Utopia. For the two Babes of Love, See Curl, Key, p. 22: But whatever reflection he is pleas'd to throw upon this Lady, surely 'twas what from him she little deserv'd, who had celebrated Curl's undertakings for Reformation of Manners, and declared her self “to be so perfectly acquainted with the sweetness of his disposition, and that tenderness with which he considered the errors of his fellow-creatures; that tho' she should find the little inadvertencies of her own life recorded in his papers, she was certain it would be done in such a manner as she could not but approve.” Mrs. Haywood, Hist. of Clar. printed in the Female Dunciad, p. 18.See in the circle next, Eliza plac'd; Imitations.

Heav'n her Eridanus no more shall boast, Whose fame like thine in lesser currents lost, Thy nobler stream shall visit Jove's abodes, To shine among the stars, and bathe the Gods.So, (fam'd like thee for turbulence and horns,) Eridanus his humble fountain scorns; Remarks. V. 175. Thro' half the Heavn's he pours th'exalted urn.] In a manuscript Dunciad (where are some marginal corrections of some gentlemen some time deceas'd) I have found another reading of these lines thus, And lifts his urn, thro' half the heav'ns to flow; His rapid waters in their passage glow. This I cannot but think the right: For first, tho' the difference between burn and glow may seem not very material to others, to me I confess the latter has an elegance, a Jenesçay quoy, which is much easier to be conceived than explained. Secondly, every reader of our Poet must have observed how frequently he uses this word glow in other parts of his works: To instance only in his Homer, (1) Iliad 9. v. 726.—With one resentment glows. (2.) Iliad 11. v. 626.—There the battle glows. (3.) Ibid. 985.—The closing flesh that instant ceas'd to glow. (4.) Il. 12. v. 45.—Encompass'd Hector glows. (5.)

I am afraid of growing too luxuriant in examples, or I could stretch this catalogue to a great extent, but these are enough to prove his fondness for this beautiful word, which therefore, let all future editions replace here. I am aware after all, that burn is the proper word to convey an idea of what was said to be Mr. Curl's condition at this time: But from that very reason I infer the direct contrary. For surely every lover of our author will conclude he had more humanity, than to insult a man on such a misfortune or calamity which could never befal him purely by his own fault, but from an unhappy communication with another. This Note is half Mr. Theobald, half Scriblerus.Thro' half the heav'ns he pours th'exalted urn; His rapid waters in their passage burn. Swift as it mounts, all follow with their eyes; Still happy Impudence obtains the prize. Remarks. V. 179. The high-wrought day.] Some affirm, this was originally—the well-p?st day: but the Poet's decency would not suffer it. Here the learned Scriblerus manifests great anger: he exclaims against all such Conjectural Emendations in this manner. “Let it suffice, O Pallas! that every noble ancient, Greek or Roman, hath suffer'd the impertinent correction of every Dutch, German, and Switz Schoolmaster! Let our English at least escape, whose intrinsic is scarce of marble so solid, as not to be impaired or foiled by such rude and dirty hands. Suffer them to call their works their own, and after death at least to find rest and sanctuary from Critics! When these men have ceased to rail, let them not begin to do worse, to comment! let them, not conjecture into nonsense, correct out of all correctness, and restore into obscurity and confusion. Miserable fate! which can befal only the sprightliest wits that have written, and will befall them only from such dull ones as could never write! Scriblerus.Thou triumph'st, Victor of the high-wrought day, And the pleas'd dame, soft-smiling leads away. Chapman, thro' perfect modesty o'ercome, Crown'd with the Jordan, walks contented home. But now for Authors nobler palms remain; Room for my Lord! three Jockeys in his train: Six huntsmen with a shout precede his chair; He grins, and looks broad nonsense with a stare. His honour'd meaning Dulness thus exprest; “He wins this Patron who can tickle best. He chinks his purse, and takes his seat of state: With ready quills the Dedicators wait, Now at his head the dext'rous task commence, And instant, fancy feels th'imputed sense; Now gentle touches wanton o'er his face, He struts Adonis, and affects grimace: Remarks. V. 195. Paolo Antonio Rolli, an Italian Poet, and writer of many Opera's in that language, which, partly by the help of his genius, prevail'd in England near twenty years. He taught Italian to some fine Gentlemen who affected to direct the Opera's. Rolli the feather to his ear conveys, Then his nice taste directs our Opera's: Remarks. V. 197. Bentley his mouth, &amp;c.] Not spoken of the famous Dr. Richard Bentley, but of one Thom. Bentley, a small critick, who aped his Uncle in a little Horace. The great one was intended to be dedicated to the Lord Hallifax, but (on a change of the Ministry) was given to the Earl of Oxford; for which reason the little one was dedicated to his son the Lord Harley. A Taste of his Classic Elocution may be seen in this following Panegyrick on the Peace of Utretht. Cupimus Patrem tuum, fulgentissimum illud Orbis Anglicani jubar, adorare. O ingens Reipublicae nostræ columen! O fortunatam tanto Heroe Britanniam! Illi tali tantoque viro, Deum per Omnia adfuisse, manumque ejus &amp; mentem direxisse, Certissimum est. Hujus enim Unius fermè opera, Æquissimis &amp; perhonorificis conditionibus, diuturno heu nimium! bello, finem impositum videmus. Oh Diem æterna memoria dignissimam! qua terrores Patriæ omnes excidit, Pacem que diu exoptatam toti ferè Europæ restituit, ille Populi Anglicani Amor, Harleius. Thus critically (that is verbally) translated. “Thy Father, that most refulgent star of the Anglican Orb, we much desire to adore! oh mighty Column of our Republick! Oh Britain fortunate in such an Hero! That to such and so great a Man God was ever present, in every thing, and all along directed both his Hand and his Heart, is a Most Absolute Certainty! For, it is in a manner by the operation of this Man Alone, that we behold a War (alas! how much too long an one!) brought at length to an end, on the most just and the most honourable Conditions. Oh Day eternally to be memorated! wherein All the Terrors of this Country were ended; and a Peace (long wished for by almost all Europe) restored by Harley, the Love and Delight of the People of England. But that this Gentleman can write in a different Style, may be seen in a Letter to Mr. Pope, occasion'd by Sober Advice from Horace, wherein several Noble Lords are treated in a most extraordinary language, particularly the Lord Bolingbroke abused for that very Peace, which he here makes the single work of the Earl of Oxford, directed by God Almighty. Bentley his mouth with classic flatt'ry opes, And the puff'd orator bursts out in tropes. Remarks. V. 199. Welsted.] Leonard Welsted, author of the Triumvirate, or a Letter in verse from Palæmon to Celia at Bath, which was meant for a Satire on Mr. P. and some of his friends, about the year 1718. He writ other things which we cannot remember. Smedley in his Metamorphosis of Scriblerus mentions one, the Hymn of a Gentleman to his Creator: and there was another in praise either of a Cellar, or a Garret. L. W. characteris'd in the treatise ???? ?????? or the Art of Sinking, as a Didapper, and after as an Eel, is said to be this person, by Dennis, Daily Journal of May 11, 1728. He was also characteris'd under another animal, a Mole, by the author of the ensuing Simile which was handed about at the same time. Dear Welsted, mark, in dirty hole, That painful animal, a Mole: Above-ground never born to go, What mighty stir it keeps below? To make a Molehill all this strife! It digs, pokes, undermines for life. How proud, a little Dirt to spread! Conscious of nothing o'er its head. Till, lab'ring on for want of eyes, It blunders into Light—and dies. You have him again in book 3. v. 163.But Welsted most the poet's healing balm Strives to extract, from his soft, giving palm; Unlucky Welsted! thy unfeeling master, The more thou ticklest, gripes his fist the faster. While thus each hand promotes the pleasing pain, And quick sensations skip from vein to vein, Remarks.V. 205. A youth unknown to Phœbus, &amp;c.] The satire of this Episode being levelled at the base flatteries of authors to worthless wealth or greatness, concludes here with an excellent lesson to such men; That altho' their pens and praises were as exquisite as they conceit of themselves, yet (even in their own mercenary views) a creature unletter'd, who serveth the passions, or pimpeth to the pleasures, of such vain, braggart, puft Nobility, shall with those patrons be much more inward, and of them much higher rewarded. Scriblerus.A youth unknown to Phœbus, in despair, Puts his last refuge all in heav'n and pray'r. What force have pious vows? the Queen of Love His Sister sends, her vot'ress, from above. As taught by Venus, Paris learnt the art To touch Achilles' only tender part; Secure, thro' her, the noble prize to carry, He marches off, his Grace's Secretary, Now turn to diff'rent sports (the Goddess cries) And learn, my sons, the wond'rous pow'r of Noise.

V. 218. With thunder rumbling from the mustard-bowl.] The old way of making Thunder and Mustard were the same; but since, it is more advantageously performed by troughs of wood with stops in them. Whether Mr. Dennis was the inventor of that improvement, I know not; but it is certain, that being once at a Tragedy of a new Author, he fell into a great passion at hearing some, and cry'd, “S'death! that is my Thunder.With Thunder rumbling from the mustard bowl, With horns and trumpets now to madness swell, Remarks. V. 220. With a tolling Bell.] A mechanical help to the Pathetic not unuseful to the modern writers of Tragedy.Now sink in sorrows with a tolling Bell.

Three Cat-calls.] Certain musical instruments used by one sort of Critics to confound the Poets of the Theatre.Improve we these. Three Cat-calls be the bribe, Of him, whose chatt'ring shames the Monkey tribe, And his this Drum, whose hoarse heroic base Drowns the loud clarion of the braying Ass.

A Simile with a long tail, in the manner of Homer.As when the long-ear'd milky mothers wait At some sick miser's triple-bolted gate, For their defrauded, absent foals they make A moan so loud, that all the Guild awake; Sore sighs Sir Gilbert, starting, at the bray, From dreams of millions, and three groats to pay! So swells each wind-pipe; Ass intones to Ass, Harmonic twang, of leather, horn, and brass; Such, as from lab'ring lungs th'Enthusiast blows, High sounds, attempted to the vocal nose. But far o'er all, sonorous Blackmore's strain; Imitations. V. 248.—bray back to him again.] A figure of speech taken from Virgil, Et vox assensu nemorum ingeminata remugit. Geor. 3. He hears his num'rous herds low o'er the plain, While neighb'ring hills low back to them again. Cowley. The poet here celebrated, Sir R.

The progress of the sound from place to place, and the scenary here of the bordering regions, Tot'nam-fields, Chanc'ry-lane, the Thames, Westminster-hall, and Hungerford-stairs, are imitated from Virg. Æn. 7. on the sounding the horn of Alecto. Audiit &amp; Triviæ longe lacus, audiit amnis Sulphurea Nar albus aqua, fontesque Velini, &amp;c.Prick all their ears up, and forget to graze; Remarks. V. 251. Long Chanc'ry-lane.] The place where the offices of Chancery are kept: The long detention of Clients in that Court, and the difficulty of getting out, in humourously allegoriz'd in these lines.Long Chanc'ry-lane retentive rolls the sound, And courts to courts return it round and round: Thames wasts it thence to Rufus' roaring hall, And Hungerford re-ecchoes bawl for bawl. All hail him victor in both gifts of song, Remarks. V. 256. Who sings so loudly, and who sings so long.] A just character of Sir Richard Blackmore, Knt. who (as Mr. Dryden express'd it.) Writ to the rumbling of his Coach's wheels, and whose indefatigable Muse produced no less than six Epic poems: Prince and King Arthur, 20 Books; Eliza, 10; Alfred, 12; The Redeemer, 6: besides Job in folio, the whole Book of Psalms, The Creation, 7 Books; Nature of Man, 3 Books, and many more. 'Tis in this sense he is stiled afterwards, the Everlasting Blackmore. Notwithstanding all which, Mr. Gildon seems assured, that “this admirable author did not think himself upon the same foot with Homer. Comp. Art of Poetry, Vol. 1. p. 108. But how different is the judgment of the author of Characters of the Times? p. 25. who says, “Sir Richard is unfortunate in happening to mistake his proper talents, and that he has not for many years been so much as named or even thought of among writers. Even Mr. Dennis differs greatly from his friend Mr. Gildon; “Blackmore's Actions (saith he) has neither unity, nor integrity, nor morality, nor universality; and consequently he can have no Fable, and no Heroic Poem: His Narration is neither probable, delightful, nor wonderful: His Characters have none of the necessary qualifications. The things contain'd in his Narration are neither in their own nature delightful, nor numerous enough, nor rightly disposed, nor surprising, nor pathetick.—Nay he proceeds so far as to say Sir Richard has no Genius; first laying down, that Genius is caused by a furious joy and pride of soul, on the conception of an extraordinrry Hint. Many Men (says he) have their Hints, without these motions of fury and pride of soul, because they want fire enough to agitate their spirits; and these we call cold writers: Others who have a great deal of fire, but have not excellent organs, feel the foremention'd motions, without the extraordinary hints; And these we call fustian writers. But he declares that Sir Richard had neither the Hints, nor the Motions. Remarks on Pr. Arth. 8vo. 1696. Preface. This gentleman in his first works abused the character of Mr. Dryden, and in his last of Mr. Pope, accusing him in very high and sober terms of prophaneness and immorality (Essay on polite writing, Vol. 2. p. 270.) on a meer report from Edm. Curl, that he was author of a Traverstie on the first Psalm. Mr. Dennis took up the same report, but with the addition of what Sir Richard had neglected, an Argument to prove it; which being very curious, we shall here transcribe. (Remarks on Homer, 8vo. p. 27.) “It was he who burlesqu'd the Psalm of David. It is apparent to me that Psalm was burlesqu'd by a Popish rhymester, Let rhymeing persons who have been brought up Protestants be otherwise what they will, let them be rakes, let 'em be scoundrels, let 'em be Atheists, yet education has made an invincible impression on them in behalf of the sacred writings. But a Popish rhymester has been brought up with a contempt for those sacred writings. Now show me another Popish rhymester but he. This manner of argumentation is usual with Mr. Dennis; he has employ'd the same against Sir Richard himself in a like charge of Impiety and Irreligion. “All Mr. Blackmore's celestial Machines, as they cannot be defended so much as by common receiv'd opinion, so are directly contrary to the doctrine of the Church of England: For the visible descent of an Angel must be a miracle. Now it is the doctrine of the Church of England that miracles had ceas'd a long time before Prince Arthur came into the world. Now if the doctrine of the Church of England be true, as we are obliged to believe, then are all the celestial machines in Prince Arthur unsufferable, as wanting not only human but divine probability. But if the machines are sufferable, that is if they have so much as divine probability, then it follows of necessity that the doctrine of the Church is false: So I leave it to every impartial Clergyman to consider, &amp;c. Preface to the Remarks on Prince Arthur.Who sings so loudly, and who sings so long. This labour past, by Bridewell all descend, Remarks. V. 258. As morning-pray'r and flagellation end.] It is between eleven and twelve in the morning, after church service, that the criminals are whipt in Bridewell. —This is to mark punctually the Time of the day: Homer does it by the circumstance of the Judges rising from court, or of the Labourer's dinner; our author by one very proper both to the Persons and the Scene of his Poem; which we may remember commenc'd in the evening of the Lord mayor's day: The first book passed in that night; the next morning the games begin in the Strand, thence along Fleet-street (places inhabited by Booksellers) then they proceed by Bridewell toward Fleetditch, and lastly thro' Ludgate to the City and the Temple of the Goddess.(As morning-pray'r and flagellation end) To where Fleet-ditch with disemboguing streams Rolls the large tribute of dead dogs to Thames, Imitations.

V. 270. A peck of coals a-piece] Our indulgent Poet, whenever he has spoken of any dirty or low work, constantly puts us in mind of the poverty of the offenders, as the only extenuation of such practices. Let any one but remark, when a Theif, a Pickpocket, a Highwayman, or a Knight of the Post is spoken of, how much our hatred to those characters is lessen'd, if they add a needy Theif, a poor Pickpocket, a hungry Highwayman, a starving Knight of the post, &amp;c.“A peck of coals a-piece shall glad the rest. Remarks. V. 271. In naked majesty Oldmixon stands.] Mr. John Oldmixon, next to Mr. Dennis the most ancient Critic of our Nation: an unjust censurer of Mr. Addison in his Prose Essay on Criticism, whom also in his imitation of Bouhours (call'd the Arts of Logick and Rhetorick) he misrepresents in plain matter of fact: for in p. 45, he cites the Spectator as abusing Dr. Swift by name, where there is not the least hint of it; And in p. 304, is so injurious as to suggest, that Mr. Addison himself writ that Tatler, No. 43, which says of his own Simile, that “'tis as great as ever entered into the mind of man. In Poetry, he was not so happy as laborious, and therefore characteriz'd by the Tatler, No. 62, by the name of Omicron the Unborn Poet. Curl, Key, p. 13. He writ Dramatic works, and a volume of Poetry, consisting of heroic Epistles, &amp;c. some whereof are very well done, saith that great Judge Mr. Jacob, in his Lives of Poets, V. 2. p. 303. In his Essay on Criticism, and the Arts of Logick and Rhetorick, he frequently reflects on our Author. But the top of his character was a Perverter of History, in that scandalous one of the Stuarts in folio, and his Critical History of England, 2 vol. 8vo. Being imployed by Bishop Kennet in publishing the Historians in his Collection, he falsified Daniel's Cronicle in numberless places. Yet this very man, in the preface to the first of these, advanced a particular Fact to charge three eminent Persons of falsifying the Lord Clarendon's History; which Fact has been disproved by the Bishop of Rochester, then the only survivor of them; and the particular part he pretended to be falsifyed, produced since, after almost ninety years, in that nople Author's own hand. He was all his life a virulent Party-writer for hire, and received his reward in a small place which he yet enjoys. He is here likened to Milo, in allusion to that verse of Ovid, ? Fletque Milon senior, cum spectat inanes Herculeis similes, fluidos pendere lacertos; either with regard to his Age, or because he was undone by trying to pull to pieces an Oak that was too strong for him. ? Remember Milo's end, Wedg'd in that timber which he strove to rend. Lord Rosc.In naked majesty Oldmixon stands, And Milo-like, surveys his arms and hands, Then sighing, thus. “And am I now threescore? “Ah why, ye Gods! should two and two make four? He said, and climb'd a stranded Lighter's height, Shot to the black abyss, and plung'd down-right. The Senior's judgment all the crowd admire, Who but to sink the deeper, rose the higher. Remarks. V. 279. Next Smedley div'd.] In the surreptitious editions, this whole Episode was applied to an initial letter E?, by whom if they meant the Laureate, nothing was more absurd, no part agreeing with his character. The Allegory evidently demands a person dipp'd in scandal, and deeply immers'd in dirty-work: whereas Mr. Eusden's writings rarely offended but by their length and multitude, and accordingly are tax'd of nothing else in book 1. verse 102. But the person here mention'd, an Irishman, was author and publisher of many scurrilous pieces, a weekly Whitehall Journal in the year 1722, in the name of Sir James Baker, and particularly whole volumes of Billingsgate against Dr. Swift and Mr. Pope, call'd Gulliveriana and Alexandriana, printed in 8vo. 1728.Next Smedley div'd; slow circles dimpled o'er The quaking mud, that clos'd, and op'd no more.

Then ? essay'd.] A Gentleman of genius and spirit, who was secretly dipt in some papers of this kind, on whom our Poet bestows a panegyric instead of a Satire, as deserving to be better imployed than in party-quarrels and Personal invectives.Then ? essay'd; scarce vanish'd out of sight, He buoys up instant, and returns to light: He bears no token of the sabler streams, And mounts far off among the Swans of Thames, Remarks. V. 287. Concanen.] Matthew Concanen, an Irishman bred to the law: he abused Dr. Swift, to whom he had obligations, to which Smedley (one of his brethren in enmity to Swift) alludes in his Metamorphosis of Scriblerus, p. 7. accusing him of having “boasted of what he had not written, but others had revised and done for him. He was author of several dull and dead scurrilities in the British and London Journals, and in a paper call'd the Speculatist. In a pamphlet call'd a Supplement to the Profund, he dealt very unfairly with our poet, not only frequently imputing to him Mr. Broome's verses, (for which he might indeed seem in some degree accountable, having corrected what that gentleman did) but those of the Duke of Bukingham, and others. To this rare piece, some body humourously caus'd him to take for his motto, De profundis clamavi. He was since a hired Scribler in the Daily Courant, where he pour'd forth much Billingsgate against the Lord Bolingbroke and others; after which this man was surprizingly promoted to administer Justice and Law in Jamaica.True to the bottom, see Concanen creep, A cold, long-winded, native of the deep! If perseverance gain the Diver's prize, Imitations.V. 290. Not everlasting Blackmore.] Virg. Æn. 5.

Ver. 293. Arnall.] William Arnall bred an Attorney, was a perfect Genius in this Art: He began under twenty with furious Party-papers: then succeeded Concanen in the British Journal. At the first publication of the Dunciad, he prevail'd on the Author not to give him his due place in it, by a letter professing his detestation of all such practises as his predecessor's: but since, by the most unexampled insolence, impudent Billingsgate language, and personal abuse of several great men the Poet's particular friends, he hath most amply deserved a Niche in the Temple of Infamy. Witness a paper call'd the Free Briton, a Dedication intitled, To the Genuine Blunderer, 1732, and many others. He writ for hire, and valued himself upon it; but frequently thro' his fury, or folly, exceeded all the bounds of his Commission, and obliged his honourable Patron to disavow his scurrilities.Not so bold Arnall; with a weight of scull, Furious he sinks, precipitately dull. Whirlpools and storms his circling arm invest, With all the might of gravitation blest. No crab more active in the dirty dance, Downward to climb, and backward to advance.

Boyer the State, and Law the Stage gave o'er.] A. Boyer, a voluminous compiler of Annals, Political Collections, &amp;c.—William Law, A. M. wrote with great zeal against the Stage, Mr. Dennis answer'd with as great. Their books were printed in 1726. Mr. Law affirm'd that “the Playhouse is the Temple of the Devil, the peculiar pleasure of the Devil, where all they who go, yield to the Devil, where all the Laughter is a laughter among Devils, and that all who are there are hearing Musick in the very Porch of Hell. To which Mr. Dennis replied, that “there is every jot as much difference between a true Play, and one made by a Poetaster, as between Two religious books, the Bible and the Alcoran. Then he demonstrates that “All those who had written against the Stage were Jacobites and Nonjurors, and did it always at a time when something was to be done for the Pretender. Mr. Collier publish'd his Short View, when France declar'd for the Chevalier; and his Dissuasive just at the great Storm, when the devastation which that Hurricane wrought had amazed and astonished the minds of men, and made them obnoxious to melancholly and desponding thoughts: Mr. Law took the opportunity to attack the Stage upon the great preparations he heard were making abroad, and which the Jacobites flatter'd themselves were design'd in their favour: And as for Mr. Bedford's Serious Remonstrance, tho' I know nothing of the time of publishing it, yet I dare to lay odds it was either upon the Duke D'Aumont's being at Somerset-house, or upon the late Rebellion.

Norton, from Daniel and Ostræa sprung, Bless'd with his father's front, and mother's tongue, Hung silent down his never-blushing head; Imitations. V. 386. And all was hush'd, as Folly's self lay dead.] Alludes to Dryden's verse in the Indian Emperor, All things are hush'd, as Nature's self lay dead.And all was hush'd, as Folly's self lay dead. Thus the soft gifts of Sleep conclude the day, And stretch'd on bulks, as usual, Poets lay. Why should I sing what bards the nightly Muse Did slumbring visit, and convey to stews: Who prouder march'd, with magistrates in state, To some fam'd round-house, ever open gate: How Laurus lay inspir'd beside a sink, Remarks.V. 394. And to mere mortals seem'd a Priest in drink.] This line presents us with an excellent moral, that we are never to pass judgment merely by appearances; a lessen to all men who may happen to see a reverend person in the like situation, not to determine too rashly: since not only the Poets frequently describe a Bard inspir'd in this posture, (On Cam's fair bank where Chaucer lay inspir'd, and the like) but an eminent casuist tells us, that if a Priest be seen in any indecent action, we ought to account it a deception of sight, or illusion of the Devil, who sometimes takes upon him the shape of holy men on purpose to cause scandal. How little the prophane author of the Characters of the Times printed 1728, regarded this admonition, appears from these words pag. 26. (speaking of the reverend Mr. Laurence Eusden) “A most worthy successor of Tate in the Laureatship, a man of insuperable modesty, since certainly it was not his Ambition that led him to seek this illustrious post, but his Affection to the Perquisite of Sack. Scriblerus.And to mere mortals seem'd a Priest in drink: Remarks. V. 395. Fleet.] A prison for insolvent Debtors on the bank of the Ditch.While others, timely, to the neighbouring Fleet (Haunt of the Muses) made their safe retreat. End of the Second Book. [Book III.] Argument to Book the Third. After the other persons are disposed in their proper places of rest, the Goddess transports the King to her Temple, and there lays him to slumber with his head on her lap; a position of marvellous virtue, which causes all the visions of wild enthusiasts, projectors, politicians, inamorato's, castle-builders, chymists and poets. He is immediately carry'd on the wings of Fancy to the Elyzian shade, where on the banks of Lethe the souls of the dull are dipp'd by Bavius, before their entrance into this world. There he is met by the ghost of Settle, and by him made acquainted with the wonders of the place, and with those which he is himself destin'd to perform. He takes him to a Mount of Vision, from whence he shews him the past triumphs of the Empire of Dulness, then the present, and lastly the future: How small a part of the world was ever conquer'd by Science, how soon those conquests were stop'd, and those very nations again reduced to her dominion. Then distinguishing the Island of Great Britain, shews by what aids, and by what persons, it shall be forthwith brought to her empire. These he causes to pass in review before his eyes, describing each by his proper figure, character, and qualifications. On a sudden the Scene shifts, and a vast number of Miracles and prodigies appear, utterly surprizing and unknown to the King himself, till they are explained to be the wonders of his own reign now commencing. On this subject Settle breaks into a congratulation, yet not unmix'd with concern, that his own times were but the types of these; He prophecies how first the nation shall be over-run with Farces, Opera's, and Shows; and the throne of Dulness advanced over both the Theatres; Then how her sons shall preside in the seats of Arts and sciences, till in conclusion all shall return to their original Chaos: A scene, of which the present Action of the Dunciad is but a Type on Foretaste, giving a Glimpse or Pisgah-sight of the promis'd Fulness of her Glory; the Accomplishment whereof will, in all probability, hereafter be the Theme of many other and greater Dunciads. But in her Temple's last recess inclos'd, On Dulness lap th'Anointed head repos'd. Him close she curtain'd round with vapours blue, And soft besprinkled with Cimmerian dew. Remarks on Book the Third.V. 5, 6, &amp;c.] Hereby is intimated that the following Vision is no more than the chimera of the dreamer's brain, and not a real or intended satire on the present Age, doubtless more learned, more inlighten'd, and more abounding with great Genius's in Divinity, Politics, and whatever arts and sciences, than all the preceding. For fear of any such mistake of our Poet's honest meaning, he hath again at the end of the Vision repeated this monition, saying that it all past thro' the Ivory gate, which according to the Ancients) denoteth Falsity. Scriblerus.Then raptures high the seat of sense o'erflow, Which only heads refin'd from reason know. Hence, from the straw where Bedlam's Prophet nods, Imitations. V. 8.

Et varias audit voces, fruiturque deorum Colloquio ?He hears loud Oracles, and talks with Gods: Hence the Fool's paradise, the Statesman's scheme, The air-built Castle, and the golden Dream, The Maid's romantic wish, the Chymist's flame, And Poet's vision of eternal fame. And now, on Fancy's easy wing convey'd, The King descended to th'Elyzian Shade. Imitations. V. 15. There in a dusky vale, &amp;c.] Virg. Æn. 6. ? Videt Æneas in valle reducta Seclusum nemus ? Lethæumque domos placidas qui prænatat amnem, &amp;c. Hunc circum innumeræ gentes, &amp;c.There, in a dusky vale where Lethe rolls, Remarks. V. 16. Old Bavius sits.] Bavius was an ancient Poet, celebrated by Virgil for the like cause as Tibbald by our author, tho' not in so christian-like a manner: For heathenishly it is declar'd by Virgil of Bavius, that he ought to be hated and detested for his evil works; Qui Bavium non odit; whereas we have often had occasion to observe our Poet's great good nature and mercifulness, thro' the whole course of this poem. Mr. Dennis warmly contends that Bavius was no inconsiderable author; nay, that “he and Mævius had (even in Augstus's days) a very formidable Party at Rome, who thought them much superior to Virgil and Horace: For (saith he) “I cannot believe they would have fixed that eternal brand upon them, if they had not been coxcombs in more than ordinary credit. Rem. on Pr. Arthur, part 2. c. 1. (An argument which if this Poem should last, will conduce to the honour of the Gentlemen of the Dunciad.) In like manner he tells us of Settle, that he was once a formidable Rival to Mr. Dryden, and that in the University of Cambridge there were those who gave him the preference. Mr. Welsted goes yet farther in his behalf. “Poor Settle was formerly the Mighty rival of Dryden: nay, for many years, bore his reputation above him. Pref. to his Poems, 8vo. p. 51.] And Mr. Milbourn cried out, “How little was Dryden able, even when his blood run high, to defend himself against Mr. Settle Notes on Dryd. Virg. p. 175. These are comfortable opinions! and no wonder some authors indulge them. Scriblerus. Imitations. V. 16.

Brown and Mears.] Booksellers, Printers for Tibbald, Mrs. Haywood, or any body—The Allegory of the souls of the dull coming forth in the form of books, drest in calve's leather, and being let abroad in vast numbers by Booksellers, is sufficiently intelligible.

V. 26. Ward in Pillory.] John Ward of Hackney, Esq; Member of Parliament, being convicted of Forgery, was first expelled the House, and then sentenc'd to the Pillory on the 17th of Febr. 1727. Mr. Curl (having likewise stood there) looks upon the mention of such a Gentleman in a satire, as a great act of Barbarity, Key to the Dunc. 3d Edit. p. 16. And another Author thus reasons upon it. Durgen. 8vo. pag. 11, 12. “How unworthy is it of Christian Charity to animate the rabble to abuse a worthy man in such a situation? What could move the Poet thus to mention a brave Sufferer, a gallant Prisoner, exposed to the view of all mankind! It was laying aside his Senses, it was committing a Crime for which the Law is deficient not to punish him! nay a Crime which Man can scarce forgive, nor Time efface! Nothing surely could have induced him to it but being bribed by a great Lady, (to whom this brave, honest, worthy Gentleman was guilty of no offence but Forgery proved in open Court, &amp;c.) But it is evident this verse could not be meant of him; it being notorious, that no Eggs were thrown at that Gentleman: Perhaps therefore it might be intended of Mr. Edward Ward the Poet.As thick as eggs at Ward in Pillory. Wond'ring he gaz'd: When lo! a Sage appears, Remarks. V. 28. And length of Ears.] This is a sophisticated reading. I think I may venture to affirm all the Copyists are mistaken here: I believe I may say the same of the Critics; Dennis, Oldmixon, Welsted, have pass'd it in silence: I have also stumbled at it, and wonder'd how an error so manifest could escape such accurate persons? I dare assert it proceeded originally from the inadvertency of some Transcriber, whose head run on the Pillory mention'd two lines before: It is therefore amazing that Mr. Curl himself should overlook it! Yet that Scholiast takes not the least notice hereof. That the learned Mist also read it thus, is plain, from his ranging this passage among those in which our Author was blamed for personal Satire on a Man's Face (whereof doubtless he might take the Ear to be a part;) So likewise Concanen, Ralph, the Flying Post and all the Herd of Commentators.—Tota armenta sequuntur. A very little Sagacity (which all these Gentlemen therefore wanted) will restore to us the true sense of the Poet, thus, By his broad shoulders known, and length of years. See how easy a change! of one single letter! That Mr. Settle was old is most certain, but he was (happily) a stranger to the Pillory. This note partly Mr. Theobald, partly Scriblerus.By his broad shoulders known, and length of ears, Known by the band and suit which Settle wore, (His only suit) for twice three years before: All as the vest, appear'd the wearers frame, Old in new state, another yet the same.

As man's mæanders to the vital spring Roll all their tydes, then back their circles bring; Or whirligigs, twirl'd round by skilful swain, Suck the thread in, then yield it out again: All nonsense thus, of old or modern date, Shall in thee center, from thee circulate. Imitations. V. 53. For this, our Queen unfolds to vision true Thy mental eye, for thou hast much to view.] This has a resemblance to that passage in Milton, l. 11. where the Angel To nobler sights from Adam's eye remov'd The film; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue The visual nerve—For he had much to see. There is a general allusion in what follows to that whole Episode.For this, our Queen unfolds to vision true Thy mental eye, for thou hast much to view: Old scenes of glory, times long cast behind Shall first recall'd, rush forward to thy mind; Then stretch thy sight o'er all her rising reign, And let the past and future fire thy brain. Ascend this hill, whose cloudy point commands Her boundless empire over seas and lands. Remarks. V. 61, 62. See round the Poles, &amp;c.] Almost the whole Southern and Northern Continent wrapt in Ignorance.See round the Poles where keener spangles shine, Where spices smoke beneath the burning Line, (Earth's wide extreams) her sable flag display'd; And all the nations cover'd in her shade! Remarks. V. 65.] Our author favours the opinion that all Sciences came from the Eastern nations.Far eastward cast thine eye, from whence the Sun And orient Science at a birth begun. One god-like Monarch all that pride confounds, He, whose long wall the wand'ring Tartar bounds. Remarks. V. 69.] Chi Ho-am-ti, Emperor of China, the same who built the great wall between China and Tartary, destroy'd all the books and learned men of that empire.Heav'ns! what a pile? whole ages perish there: And one bright blaze turns Learning into air. Thence to the south extend thy gladden'd eyes; There rival flames with equal glory rise, Remarks.

How little, mark! that portion of the ball, Where, faint at best, the beams of Science fall; Soon as they dawn, from Hyperborean skies, Embody'd dark, what clouds of Vandals rise! Lo where Mœotis sleeps, and hardly flows The freezing Tanais thro' a waste of snows, The North by myriads pours her mighty sons, Great nurse of Goths, of Alans, and of Huns.

See, where the morning gilds the palmy shore Remarks. V. 88. The Soil that arts and infant letters bore.] Phœnicia, Syria, &amp;c. where Letters are said to have been invented. In these countries Mahomet began his conquests.(The soil that arts and infant letters bore) His conqu'ring tribes th'Arabian prophet draws, And saving Ignorance enthrones by Laws. See Christians, Jews, one heavy sabbath keep; And all the Western world believe and sleep. Remarks. V. 93. Thund'ring against heathen lore.] A strong instance of this pious rage is plac'd to Pope Gregory's account. John of Salisbury gives a very odd Encomium to this Pope, at the same time that he mentions one of the strangest effects of this excess of zeal in him. Doctor sanctissimus ille Gregorius, qui melleo prædicationis imbre totam rigavit &amp; inebriavit ecclesiam, non modo Mathesin jussit ab aulâ; sed, ut traditur a majoribus, incendio dedit probatæ lectionis scripta, Palatinus quæcunque tenebat Apollo. And in another place: Fertur beatus Gregorius bibliothecam combussisse gentilem; quo divinæ paginæ gratior esset locus, &amp; major authoritas, &amp; diligentia studiosior. Desiderius Archbishop of Vienna was sharply reproved by him for teaching Grammar and Literature, and explaining the Poets: Because (says this Pope) in uno se ore cum Jovis laudibus, Christi laudes non capiunt: Et quam grave nefandumque sit, Episcopis canere quod nec Laico religioso conveniat, ipse considera. He is said, among the rest to have burn'd Livy; Quia in superstitionibus &amp; sacris Romanorum perpetuô versatur. The same Pope is accused by Vossius and others of having caus'd the noble monuments of the old Roman magnificence to be destroyed, lest those who came to Rome should give more attention to Triumphal Arches, &amp;c. than to holy things. Bayle, Dict.Lo Rome her self, proud mistress now no more Of arts, but thund'ring against heathen lore; Her gray-hair'd Synods damning books unread, And Bacon trembling for his brazen head; Padua with sighs beholds her Livy burn, And ev'n th'Antipodes Vigilius mourn. See, the Cirque falls, th'unpillar'd Temple nods, Streets pav'd with Heroes, Tyber choak'd with Gods: Remarks. V. 101. Till Peter's keys some christen'd Jove adorn, &amp;c.] After the Government of Rome devolved to the Popes, their zeal was for some time exerted in demolishing the heathen Temples and Statues, so that the Goths scarce destroyed more monuments of Antiquity out of rage, than these out of devotion. At length they spared some of the Temples by converting them to Churches, and some of the Statues, by modifying them into images of Saints. In much later times, it was thought necessary to change the statues of Apollo and Pallas on the tomb of Sannazarius, into David and Judith; the Lyre easily became a Harp, and the Gorgon's head turn'd to that of Holofernes.Till Peter's keys some christen'd Jove adorn, And Pan to Moses lends his pagan horn; See graceless Venus to a Virgin turn'd, Or Phidias broken, and Apelles burn'd. Behold yon' Isle, by Palmers, Pilgrims trod, Men bearded, bald, cowl'd, uncowl'd, shod, unshod, Peel'd, patch'd, and pyebald, linsey-woolsey brothers, Grave mummers! sleeveless some, and shirtless others.

At the same time promising to “do the like to any other who could give him the same assurance, of having never writ scurrilously against him. Imitations. V. 146. Horneck and Roome.] These two are worthily coupled, being both virulent Party-writers; and one would think prophetically, since immediately after the publishing of this piece, the former dying, the latter succeeded him in Honour and Employment. The first was Philip Horneck, Author of a Billingsgate paper call'd The High German Doctor, in the 2d Vol. of which No. 14. you may see the regard he had for our Author. Edward Roome, son of an Undertaker for Funerals in Fleetstreet, writ some of the papers call'd Pasquin, and Mr. Ducket others; where by malicious Innuendos it was endeavour'd to represent him guilty of malevolent practices with a great man then under prosecution of Parliament. He since reflected on his, and Dr. Swift's Miscellanies, in his paper call'd the Senator. Of this Man was made the following Epigram, You ask why Roome diverts you with his jokes, Yet, if he writes, is dull as other folks? You wonder at it—This Sir is the case, The jest is lost, unless he prints his Face.Lo Horneck's fierce, and Room's funereal face; Imitations. V. 147.

There may seem some Error in these verses, Mr. Jacob having proved our Author to have a Respect for him, by this undeniable Argument. “He had once a Regard for my Judgment; otherwise he would never have subscribed Two Guinea's to me, for one small Book in octavo. [Jacob's Letter to Dennis, in his Remarks on the Dunciad, pag. 49] Therefore I should think the Appellation of Blunderbuss to Mr. Jacob, like that of Thunderbolt to Scipio, was meant in his honour. Mr. Dennis argues the same way. “My writings having made great impression on the minds of all sensible men, Mr. P. repented, and to give proof of his Repentance, subscribed to my two volumes of select Works, and afterward to my two volumes of Letters. [Ibid pag. 40.] We should hence believe, the Name of Mr. Dennis hath also crept into this poem by some mistake. But from hence, gentle reader! thou may'st beware, when thou givest thy money to such Authors, not to flatter thy self that thy motives are good nature, or Charity. Jacob, the scourge of Grammar, mark with awe, Imitations. V. 150.] Virg. Æn. 6. ? duo fulmina belli Scipiadas, cladem Lybiæ!Nor less revere him, blunderbuss of Law. Remarks. V. 151. Bond and Foxton.] Two inoffensive offenders against our Poet; persons unknown, but by being mentioned by Curl.Lo Bond and Foxton, ev'ry nameless name, All crowd, who foremost shall be damn'd to fame. Some strain in rhyme; the Muses, on their racks, Scream like the winding of ten thousand jacks: Some free from rhyme or reason, rule or check, Break Priscian's head, and Pegasus's neck; Down, down they larum, with impetuous whirl, The Pindars, and the Miltons of a Curl. Remarks. V. 159. Ralph.] James Ralph, a name inserted after the first editions, not known to our author till he writ a swearing-piece call'd Sawney, very abusive of Dr. Swift, Mr. Gay, and himself. These lines allude to a thing of his, intitled, Night, a Poem. Shakespear, Hamlet. ? Visit thus the glimpses of the Moon, Making Night hideous ? This low writer constantly attended his own works with panegyricks in the Journals, and once in particular praised himself highly above Mr. Addison, in wretched remarks upon that Author's account of English Poets, printed in a London Journal, Sept. 1728. He was wholly illiterate, and knew no language, not even French. Being advised to read the rules of dramatic poetry before he began a Play, he smiled and reply'd, Shakespear writ without rules. He ended at last in the common Sink of all such writers, a political Newspaper, to which he was recommended by his friend Arnall and received a small pittance for pay.Silence, ye Wolves! while Ralph to Cynthia howls. And makes Night hideous—Answer him ye Owls! Sense, speech, and measure, living tongues and dead, Remarks. V. 162. Morris.] Besaleel, See Book 2. ver. 118.Let all give way—and Morris may be read.

Tho' deep yet clear; tho' gentle yet not dull; Strong without rage; without o'erflowing, full. Remarks. V. 163. Flow Welsted, &amp;c.] Of this Author see the Remark on Book 2. v. 199. But (to be impartial) add to it the following different character of him, Mr. Welsted had, in his youth, rais'd so great expectations of his future genius, that there was a kind of struggle between the most eminent in the two Universities, which should have the honour of his educaion? To compound this, he (civilly) became a member of both, and after having pass'd some time at the one, he removed to the other. From thence he return'd to town, where he became the darling Expectation of all the polite Writers, whose encouragement he acknowleg'd in his occasional poems, in a manner that will make no small part of the Fame of his protectors. It also appears, from his Works, that he was happy in the patronage of the most illustrious characters of the present age—Incourag'd by such a Combination in his favour, he—publish'd a book of poems, some in the Ovidian, some in the Horatian manner, in both which the most exquisit Judges pronounce he even rival'd his masters—His Love-verses have rescued that way of writing from contempt—In his Translations, he has given us the very soul and spirit of his author. His Ode—his Epistle—his Verses—his Love tale—all, are the most perfect things in all poetry, &amp;c. Welsted of Himself. Char. of the Times, 8vo. 1728. pag. 23, 24.Flow Welsted, flow! like thine inspirer Beer, Tho' stale, not ripe; tho' thin, yet never clear; So sweetly mawkish, and so smoothly dull; Heady, not strong; and foaming, tho' not full. Remarks. V. 167. Ah Dennis, &amp;c.] The reader, who has seen thro' the course of these notes, what a constant attendance Mr. Dennis paid to our Author and all his works, may perhaps wonder he should be mention'd but twice, and so slightly touch'd, in this poem. But in truth he look'd upon him with some esteem, for having (more generously than all the rest) set his Name to such writings. He was also a very old man at this time. By his own account of himself in Mr. Jacob's Lives, he must have been above threescore in the mayoralty of Sir George Thorold in 1720, and hath since happily lived ten years more. So that he is already senior to Mr. Dursey, who hitherto of all our Poets enjoy'd the longest Bodily life.Ah Dennis! Gildon ah! what ill-starr'd rage Divides a friendship long confirm'd by age? Blockheads with reason wicked wits abhor, But fool with fool is barb'rous civil war. Imitations. V. 171. Embrace, embrace my Sons! be foes no more.] Virg. Æn. 6. ?

And in the fifth, Euryalus, forma insignis viridique juventa, Nisus amere pio pueri.Behold yon Pair, in strict embraces join'd; How like in manners, and how like in mind! Remarks. V. 175.] Fam'd for good nature, Burnet, &amp;c. Ducket for pious passion to the youth. The first of these was son of the late bishop of S. Author of a weekly paper called The Grumbler, as the other was concerned in another call'd Pasquin, in which Mr. Pope was abused with the late Duke of Buckingham and Bishop of Rochester. They also joined in a piece against his first undertaking to translate the Iliad, intitled Homerides, by Sir Iliad Dogrel, printed 1715. Mr. Curl gives us this further account of Mr. Burnet. “He did himself write a Letter to the E. of Hallifax, informing his Lordship (as he tells him) of what he knew much better before. And he published in his own name several political pamphlets, A certain information of a certain discourse, A second Tale of a Tub, &amp;c. All which it is strongly affirmed were written by Colonel Ducket. Curl, Key. p. 17. But the author of the Characters of the Times tells us, these political pieces were not approv'd of by his own Father, the Reverend Bishop. Of the other works of these Gentlemen, the world has heard no more than it would of Mr. Pope's, had their united laudable endeavours discourag'd him from his undertaking. How few good works had ever appear'd (since men of true merit are always the least presuming) had there been always such champions to stifle them in their conception? And were it not better for the publick, that a million of monsters should come into the world, which are sure to die as soon as born, than that the Serpents should strangle one Hercules in his cradle? The Union of these two Authors gave occasion to this Epigram. Burnet and Ducket, friends in spite, Came hissing forth in Verse; Both were so forward, each would write, So dull, each hung an A? Thus Amphisbœna (I have read) At either end assails; None knows which leads, or which is led, For both Heads are but Tails.Fam'd for good nature, Burnet, and for truth: Remarks. V. 167.—for pious passion to the youth.] The verse is a literal translation of Virgil, Nisus amore pio pueri—and here, as in the original, apply'd to Friendship: That between Nisus and Euryalus is allowed to make one of the most amiable Episodes in the world, and surely was never interpreted in a perverse sense. But it will astonish the reader to hear, that on no other occasion than this line, a Dedication was written to this Gentleman to induce him to think something further. “Sir, you are known to have all that affection for the beautiful part of the creation which God and Nature design'd.—Sir, you have a very fine Lady—and, Sir, you have eight very fine Children,” —&amp;c. [Dedic. to Dennis Rem. on the Rape of the Lock.] The truth is, the poor Dedicator's brain was turn'd upon this article; he had taken into his head that ever since some books were written against the Stage, and since the Italian Opera had prevail'd, the nation was infected with a vice not fit to be nam'd: He went so far as to print upon the subject, and concludes his argument with this remark, “that he cannot help thinking the Obscenity of Plays excusable at this juncture; since, when that execrable sin is spread so wide, it may be of use to the reducing mens minds to the natural desire of women. Dennis, Stage defended against Mr. Law, p. 20. Our author solemnly declared, he never heard any creature but the Dedicator mention that Vice and this Gentleman together. Ducket for pious passion to the youth. Equal in wit, and equally polite, Shall this a Pasquin, that a Grumbler write; Like are their merits, like rewards they share, That shines a Consul, this Commissioner. Imitations. V. 181.

Remarks. V. 183. Arede] Read or peruse; tho' sometimes used for counsel, “Reade thy read, take thy counsaile. Thomas Sternholde in his translation of the first Psalm into English metre, hath wisely made use of this word, The man is blest that hath not bent To wicked read his ear. But in the last spurious editions of the singing Psalms the word read is changed into men. I say spurious editions, because not only here, but quite throughout the whole book of Psalms, are strange alterations, all for the worse! And yet the title-page stands as it used to do! and all (which is abominable in any book, much more in a sacred work) is ascribed to Thomas Sternhold, John Hopkins, and others! I am confident, were Sternhold and Hopkins now living, they would proceed against the innovators as cheats—A liberty which, to say no more of their intolerable alterations, ought by no means to be permitted or approved of, by such as are for Uniformity and have any regard for the old English Saxon tongue. Hearne, Gloss. on. Rob. of Gloc. Art. rede. I do herein agree with Mr. Hearn: Little is it of avail to object, that such words are become unintelligible, since they are truly English, men ought to understand them; and such as are for Uniformity should think all alterations in a language, strange, abominable, and unwarrantable. Rightly therefore, I say again, hath our Poet used ancient words, and poured them forth as a precious ointment upon good old Wormius in this place. Scriblerus. Remarks. V. ibid. Myster wight.] uncouth mortal.Right well mine eyes arede the myster wight, Remarks. V. 184.

Most rightly are ancient Words here employed, in speaking of such who so greatly delight in the same: We may say not only rightly, but wisely, yea excellently, inasmuch as for the like practise the like praise is given to Hopkins and Sternhold by Mr. Herne himself.

Wits, who like Owls, &amp;c.] These few lines exactly describe the right verbal Critic: He is to his author as a Quack to his patients, the more they suffer and complain, the better he is pleas'd; like the famous Doctor of that sort, who put up in his bills. He delighted in matters of difficulty. Some-body said well of these men, that their heads were Libraries out of order.Wits, who like owls see only in the dark, A Lumberhouse of books in ev'ry head, For ever reading, never to be read! But, where each Science lifts its modern type, Hist'ry her Pot, Divinity his Pipe, While proud Philosophy repines to show Dishonest sight! his breeches rent below; Remarks. V. 195.—Lo! Henley stands, &amp;c.] J. Henley, the Orator; he preach'd on the sundays upon Theological matters, and on the wednesdays upon all other sciences. Each auditor paid one shilling. He declaim'd some years unpunish'd against the greatest persons, and occasionally did our Author that honour. Welsted, in Oratory Transactions, No. 1. published by Henley himself, gives the following account of him. “He was born at Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire. From his own Parish school he went to St. John's College in Cambridge. He began there to be uneasy; for it shock'd him to find he was commanded to believe against his judgment in points of Religion, Philosophy, &amp;c. for his genius leading him freely to dispute all propositions, and call all points to account, he was impatient under those fetters of the free-born mind.—Being admitted to Priest's orders, he found the examination very short and superficial, and that it was not necessary to conform to the Christian Religion in order either to Deaconship, or Priesthood. He came to town, and after having for some years been a writer for Booksellers, he had an ambition to be so for Ministers of state. The only reason he did not rise in the Church we are told, “was the envy of others, and a disrelish entertain'd of him because he was not qualify'd to be a compleat Spaniel. However he offer'd the service of his pen, in one morning, to two great men of opinions and interests directly opposite; by both of whom being rejected, he set up a new Project, and stiled himself the Restorer of ancient Eloquence. He thought “it as lawful to take a licence from the King and Parliament at one place, as another; at Hick's hall, as at Doctors-Commons; so set up his Oratory in Newport-Market, Butcher-row. There (says his friend) “he had the assurance to form a Plan, which no mortal ever thought of; he had success against all opposition; challenged his adversaries to fair disputations, and none would dispute with him; writ, read and studied twelve hours a day; compos'd three dissertations a week on all subjects; undertook to teach in one year what Schools and Universities teach in five; was not terrify'd by menaces, insults or satires, but still proceeded, matured his bold scheme, and put the Church and all that, in danger. Welsted, Narrative, in Orat. Transact. No. 1. After having stood some Prosecutions, he turned his rhetoric to Buffoonry upon all publick and private occurrences. All this passed in the same room; where sometimes he broke jests, and sometimes that bread which he called the Primitive Eucharist—This wonderful person struck Medals, which he dispersed as Tickets to his subscribers: The device, a Star rising to the meridian, with this motto, Ad Summa; and below, Inveniam Viam aut faciam.Imbrown'd with native bronze, lo Henley stands, Tuning his voice, and balancing his hands, How fluent nonsense trickles from his tongue! How sweet the periods, neither said nor sung! Still break the benches, Henley! with thy strain, While Kennet, Hare, and Gibson preach in vain. Oh great Restorer of the good old Stage, Preacher at once, and Zany of thy age! Oh worthy thou of Ægypt's wise abodes, A decent priest, where monkeys were the gods! But fate with butchers plac'd thy priestly stall, Meek modern faith to murder, hack, and mawl; And bade thee live, to crown Britannia's praise, Remarks. V. 208. Of Toland and Tindal, see book 2. Tho.

Thus he, for then a ray of Reason stole, Half thro' the solid darkness of his soul; But soon the cloud return'd—and thus the Sire: See now, what Dulness and her sons admire! See what the charms that smite the simple heart, Not touch'd by nature, and not reach'd by art. Remarks. V. 227.—a sable Sorc'rer.] Dr. Faustus, the subject of a sett of Farces, which lasted in vogue two or three seasons, in which both Play-houses strove to outdo each other in the Years 1726, 1727. All the extravagancies in the sixteen lines following were introduced on the Stage, and frequented by persons of the first quality in England, to the twentieth and thirtieth time.He look'd, and saw a sable Sorc'rer rise, Swift to whose hand a winged volume flies: All sudden, Gorgons hiss, and dragons glare, And ten-horn'd fiends and Giants rush to war.

None but thy self can be thy parallel.] A marvellous line of Theobald; unless the Play call'd the Double Falshood be (as he would have it believ'd) Shakespear's: But whether this line be his or not, he proves Shakespear to have written as bad, (which methinks in an author for whom he has a veneration almost rising to idolatry, might have been concealed) as for example, Try what Repentance can: what can it not? But what can it, when one cannot repent? —For Cogitation Resides not in the man who does not think, &amp;c. Mist's Journ. But this last line is no man's nonsense but Tibbald's, as he might have found, had he read the Context— ? who does not think My wife is slippery ? Cymbeline. Remarks. V. id.] The former Annotator seeming to be of opinion that the Double Falshood is not Shakespear's; it is but justice to give Mr. Theobald's Arguments to the contrary, in his preface to that play. First that the MS. was above sixty years old: secondly that once Mr. Betterton had it, or he hath heard so: thirdly, that somebody told him the author gave it to a bastard-daughter of his: but fourthly and above all, “that he has a great mind every thing that is good in our tongue should be Shakespear's.” I allow these reasons to be truly critical; but what I am infinitely concern'd at is, that so many Errors have escaped the learned Editor: a few whereof we shall here amend out of a much greater number, as an instance of our regard to this dear relick. Double Falshood. Act I. Scene I. I have his letters of a modern date, Wherein by Julio, good Camillo's son (Who as he says, [] shall follow hard upon, And whom I with the growing hour [] expect) He doth sollicit the return of gold, To purchase certain horse that like him well. This place is corrupted: the epithet good is a meer insignificant expletive, but the alteration of that single word restores a clear light to the whole context, thus, I have his letters of a modern date, Wherein by July, (by Camillo's son, Who, as he saith, shall follow hard upon, And whom I with the growing hours expect) He doth sollicit the return of gold. Here you have not only the Person specify'd, by whose hands the return was to be made, but the most necessary part, the Time in which it was required. Camillo's son was to follow hard upon—what? why upon July.—Horse that like him well, is very absurd: Read it, without contradiction. ? Horse, that he likes well. Act I.at the end. ? I must stoop to gain her, Throw all my gay Comparisons aside And turn my proud additions out of service: Saith Henriques of a maiden of low condition, objecting his high quality: What have his Comparisons here to do? Correct it boldly, Throw all my gay Caparisons aside, And turn my proud additions out of service. Act 2. Scene I All the verse of this Scene is confounded with prose. ? O that a man Could reason down this Feaver of the blood, Or sooth with words the tumult in his heart! Then Julio, I might be indeed thy friend. Read—this fervor of the blood, Then Julio, I might be in deed thy friend. marking the just opposition of deeds and words. Act 4. Scene 1. How his eyes shake fire!—said by Violante, observing how the lustful shepherd looks at her. It must be, as the sense plainly demands, ? How his eyes take fire! And measure every piece of youth about me! Ibid. That, tho' I wore disguises for some ends. She had but one disguise, and wore it but for one end. Restore it, with the alteration but of two letters, therefore, That, tho' I were disguised for some end. Act 4. Scene 2. —To oaths no more give credit, To tears, to vows; false both! False Grammar I'm sure. Both can relate but to two things: And see! how easy a change sets it right? To tears, to vows, false troth ? I could shew you that very word Troth, in Shakespear a hundred times. Ib. For there is nothing left thee now to look for, That can bring comfort, but a quiet grave. This I fear is of a piece with None but itself can be its parallel: for the grave puts an end to all sorrow, it can then need no comfort. Yet let us vindicate Shakespear where we can: I make no doubt but he wrote thus, For there is nothing left thee now to look for. Nothing, that can bring quiet, but the grave. Which reduplication of the word gives a much stronger emphasis to Violante's concern. This figure is call'd Anadyplosis. I could shew you a hundred just such in him, if I had nothing else to do.

After the Revolution he kept a Booth at Bartlemew fair, where in the Droll call'd St. George for England, he acted in his old age in a Dragon of green leather of his own invention.

Tibbald is translating this author: he printed a specimen of him many years ago, of which we only remember that the first note contained some comparison between Prometheus and Christ crucify'd.Another Æschylus appears! prepare For new abortions, all ye pregnant fair! In flames, like Semeles, be brought to bed, While opening Hell spouts wild-fire at your head. Imitations. V. 315—Like Semeles—] See Ovid, Met. 3.Now Bavius take the poppy from thy brow, And place it here! here all ye Heroes bow! Remarks. V. 317. Eusden wear the bays.] See Book 1. verse 102. I have before observ'd something like prophecy in our author. Eusden, whom he here couples with Cibber, no sooner died, but his place of Laureate was supply'd by Cibber, in the year 1730, on which was made the ensuing epigram. In merry old England it once was a rule, The King had his poet, and also his fool: But now we're so frugal, I'd have you to know it, That Cibber can serve both for fool and for poet. Imitations. V. 317. This, this is he, foretold by ancient rhymes, Th'Augustus, &amp;c.] Virg. Æn. 6. Hic vir, hic est! tibi quem promitti sæpius audis, Augustus Cæsar, divum genus; aurea condet Sæcula qui rursus Latio, regnata per arva Saturno quondam ? Saturnian here relates to the age of Lead, mention'd book 1. ver. 26.This, this is he, foretold by ancient rhymes: Th'Augustus, born to bring Saturnian times: Beneath his reign, shall Eusden wear the bays, Cibber preside, Lord-Chancellor of Plays. Remarks. V. 321. Benson sole judge of architecture sit.] W?m Benson (late surveyor of the buildings to his Majesty King George I.) gave in a report to the Lords, that their house and the painted chamber adjoining were in immediate danger of falling. Whereupon the Lords met in a committee, to appoint some other place to sit in, while the house should be taken down. But it being proposed to cause some other builders first to inspect it, they found it in very good condition. The Lords, upon this, were going upon an address to the King against Benson, for such a misrepresentation; but the Earl of Sunderland, then secretary, gave them an assurance that his Majesty would remove him, which was done accordingly. In favour of this man, the famous Sir Christopher Wren, who had been architect to the crown for above fifty years, who built most of the Churches in London, laid the first stone of St. Paul's, and lived to finish it, had been diplac'd from his employment at the age of near ninety years. Benson sole judge of architecture sit, Remarks. V. 322. And Ambrose Philips.] He was (saith Mr. Jacob) “one of the wits at Button's, and a justice of the peace. But since he hath met with higher preferment in Ireland: and a much greater character we have of him in Mr. Gildon's compleat Art of poetry, V. 1. p. 157. “Indeed he confesses, he dares not set him quite on the same foot with Virgil, lest it should seem flattery: but he is much mistaken if posterity does not afford him a greater esteem than he at present enjoys. He endeavour'd to create some mis-understanding between our author and Mr. Addison, whom also soon after he abused as much. His constant cry was, that Mr. P. was an Enemy to the government; and in particular he was the avowed author of a report very industriously spread, that he had a hand in a party-paper call'd the Examiner: A falshood well known to those yet living, who had the direction and publication of it. Qui meprise Cotin, n'estime point son Roy, Et n'a, (selon Cotin,) ni Dieu, ni Foy, ni Loy.And Ambrose Philips be preferr'd for wit! Remarks. V. 323. Dormitory wall.] The dormitory in Westminster was a building intended for the lodging of the King's scholars; toward which a sum was left by Dr. Edw. Hannes, the rest was raised by contributions procured from several eminent persons by the interest of Francis late Bishop of Rochester, and Dean of Westminster. He requested the Earl of Burlington to be the Architect, who carry'd on the work till the bill against that learned prelate was brought in, which ended in his banishment. The shell being finished according to his design, the succeding Dean and Chapter employ'd a common builder to do the inside, which is perform'd accordingly.While naked mourns the Dormitory wall, Remarks. V. 324. And Jones and Boyle's united labours fall.] At the time when this poem was written, the banqueting-house of White-hall, the church and piazza of Covent-garden, and the palace and chappel of Somerset-house, the works of the famous Inigo Jones, had been for many years so neglected as to be in danger of ruin. The portico of Covent Garden church had been just then restor'd and beautify'd at the expence of the Earl of Burlington; who, at the same time, by his publication of the designs of that great Master and Palladio, as well as by many noble buildings of his own, revived the true taste of Architecture in this Kingdom.And Jones and Boyle's united labours fall, While Wren with sorrow to the grave descends, Remarks. V. 326. Gay dies unpension'd, &amp;c.] See Mr. Gay's fable of the Hare and Many Friends. This gentleman was early in the friendship of our author, which continued to his death. He wrote several works of humour with great success, the Shepherd's Week, Trivia, the What-d'ye-call-it, Fables, and lastly, the celebrated Beggars Opera; a piece of satire which hit all tastes and degrees of men, from those of the highest quality to the very rabble: That verse of Horace Primores populi arripuit, populumque tributim, could never be so justly apply'd as to this. The vast success of it was unprecedented, and almost incredible: What is related of the wonderful effects of the ancient music or tragedy hardly came up to it: Sophocles and Euripides were less follow'd and famous. It was acted in London sixty-three days, uninterrupted; and renew'd the next season with equal applauses. It spread into all the great towns of England, was play'd in many places to the 30th, and 40th time, at Bath and Bristol 50, &amp;c. It made its progress into Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, where it it was performed 24 days together. It was lastly acted in Minorca. The fame of it was not confin'd to the author only; the ladies carry'd about with 'em the favourite songs of it in fans; and houses were furnish'd with it in screens. The person who acted Polly, till then obscure, became all at once the favourite of the town; her pictures were ingraved and sold in great numbers, her life written, books of letters and verses to her publish'd, and pamphlets made even of her sayings and jests. Furthermore, it drove out of England for that season the Italian Opera, which had carry'd all before it for ten years: That idol of the Nobility and the people, which the great Critic Mr. Dennis by the labours and outcries of a whole life could not overthrow, was demolish'd by a single stroke of this gentleman's pen. This remarkable period happen'd in the years 1728. Yet so great was his modesty, that he constantly prefixed to all the editions of it this motto, Nos hæc novimus esse nihil. Gay dies unpension'd with a hundred friends, Remarks. V. 327. Hibernian politicks, O Swift! thy fate,] See book. 1. vers. 24. Hibernian politicks, O Swift, thy fate, Remarks. V. 328. And Pope's whole years to comment and translate, &amp;c.] The Author here plainly laments that he was so long employed in translating and commenting. He began the Iliad in 1713 and finish'd it in 1719. The Edition of Shakespear, (which he undertook merely because he thought no body else would) took up near two years more, in the drudgery of comparing Impressions, rectifying the Scenary, &amp;c. and the translation of half the Odyssey employ'd him from that time to 1725.And Pope's whole years to comment and translate. Imitations. V. 329. Proceed great days.] Virg. Ecl. 4. ? Incipiunt magni procedere menses.Proceed great days! till learning fly the shore, Till birch shall blush with noble blood no more, Till Thames see Eton's sons for ever play, Till Westminster's whole year be holiday; Till Isis' elders reel, their pupils sport; And Alma Mater lye dissolv'd in port! Signs following signs lead on the mighty year; See! the dull star roll round and re-appear. Remarks. V. 337. She comes! the cloud compelling Pow'r, behold! With Night primæval, and with Chaos old. Here the Muse, like Jove's eagle, after a sudden stoop at ignoble game, soareth again to the skies. As prophecy hath ever been one of the chief provinces of poesy, our poet here foretells from what we feel, what we are to fear; and in the style of other prophets, hath used the future tense for the preterit; since what he says shall be, is already to be seen, in the writings of some even of our most admired authors, in divinity, philosophy, physics, metaphysics, &amp;c. (who are too good indeed to be named in such company.) Do not gentle reader, rest too secure in thy contempt of the Instruments for such a revolution in learning, or despise such weak agents as have been described in our poem; but remember what the Dutch stories somewhere relate, that a great part of their Provinces was once overflow'd, by a small opening made in one of their dykes by a single water-rat. However, that such is not seriously the judgment of our Poet, but that he conceiveth better hopes from the diligence of our Schools, from the regularity of our Universities, the discernment of our Great men, the encouragement of our Patrons, and the genius of our Writers in all kinds, (notwithstanding some few exceptions in each) may plainly be seen from his conclusion; where by causing all this vision to pass thro' the Ivory gate, he expresly in the language of poesy declares all such imaginations to be wild, ungrounded and fictitious. Scriblerus.She comes! the cloud-compelling Pow'r, behold! With Night primæval, and with Chaos old. Lo! the great Anarch's ancient reign restor'd; Light dies before her uncreating word. As one by one, at dread Medæa's strain, The sick'ning stars fade off th'æthereal plain; Imitations. V. 343. As Argus' eyes by Hermes wand opprest.] Ovid. Met. 2. Et quamvis sopor est oculorum parte receptus, Parte tamen vigilat—Vidit Cyllenius omnes Succubuisse oculos, &amp;c. ibid.As Argus' eyes, by Hermes wand opprest, Clos'd one by one to everlasting rest; Thus at her felt approach, and secret might, Art after art goes out, and all is night. Remarks. V. 347. Truth in her old Cavern lye.] Alludes to the saying of Democritus, that truth lay at the bottom of a deep well.See sculking Truth in her old cavern lye, Secur'd by mountains of heap'd casuistry: Philosophy, that touch'd the heav'ns before, Shrinks to her hidden cause, and is no more: See Physic beg the Stagyrite's defence! See Metaphysic call for aid on sense! See mystery to Mathematics fly; In vain! they gaze, turn giddy, rave, and die. Thy hand, great Dulness! lets the curtain fall, And universal darkness buries all. Enough! enough! the raptur'd monarch cries; Imitations. V. 358. And thro' the Ivory gate the vision flies.] Virg. Æn. 6. Sunt geminæ somni portæ; quarum altera fertur Cornea, qua veris facilis datur exitus umbris; Altera, candenti perfecta nitens elephanto, Sed falsa ad cœlum mittunt insomnia manes.And thro' the Ivory gate the vision flies.
