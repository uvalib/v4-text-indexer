      <field name="fulltext">The fyrst Psalme of Dauid. That man is happy and blessed, that hath not gone astraye: In the counsel of wycked men, nor stande in synners waye. The man is blest, I say, that hath not sate in companye: With scorneful men that thyncke wysedom, to reste in them onelye. But hath in the lawe of the Lorde set hys onely delyght: And will in the same exercise, hym selfe both daye and nyght. He shalbe like a tree planted, faste by the ryuerssyde: That doeth bringe forth and geue her fruite in her due tyme and tyde. And as the leafe therof doeth not fall, but florishe and stande: So shall all thynges prospere ryght well, that he doeth take in hande. The wicked shalbe nothinge like, but as leaues that are drye: And as the chaffe and thynges of naught, that with the wynde do flye, Therfore the wicked shall not ryse, and stande in the iudgement: Neyther synners emonge the iuste, that seke Goddes testament. For the Lord knoweth the iust mans way, and hath it allowed: But the way of the wicked men, shalbe quite destroyed. The .ij. Psalme. Why do the Gentiles runne on heapes, with suche rage and tumult? Why do the people syt and muse, &amp; on vayne thinges consult? The kynges and rulars of the earth, do cluster and conuent: Agaynst the Lorde and are agaynste his annoynted full bent. Shall we be bounde to them (say they) let al their bondes be broke: And of their doctrine and their lawes, let vs reiect the yoke. But he that dwelleth in heauen, doeth their doynges deryde: And maketh th? al mocking stockes, through oute the worlde so wyde. And in hys wrath the Lorde wyl speake to them vpon a daye: And in hys furye trouble them, and then the Lord wyll saye. Upon myne holy hyll Syon, my kynge I haue poynted: And ouer all my chosen flocke I haue hym annoynted. Then shall the kynge saye thus agayne, hys wyl I wyll declare: And eke recyte al maner thynges, that in his decrees are. For vnto me the Lorde him selfe, sayde in thys wyse I wote: Thou arte my deare and only sonne, to daye I the begotte. At thy requeste I wyll geue the (as heyres) all nacyons: And al the borders of the earth for thy possessyons. Wyth a scepter a mase of stele, thou shalte rule them I saye: And shalt breake them into peces, as a potte made of claye. O ye kinges and ye rulars al, get ye wysedome therfore: And eke ye iudges of the earth, of learnynge get ye store. Se that ye serue the Lorde aboue, in tremblynge and in feare: And wyth reuerence se ye do reioyce in lyke maner. Se that ye kysse and eke embrace, hys only sonne I saye: Leaste in his wrath ye peryshe all, and wander from hys waye. For his wrath shall ful sodenly, be kendled in hys breste: But all that put their trust in hym shall certaynely be bleste. The .iij. Psalme. O Lorde howe many be my foes, that agaynst me do ryse? And howe manye saye to my soule, God doeth hym quite despyse. But thou O Lorde arte my target, when I am harde besteade: Myne honoure and my glorye both, and holdeste vp mine heade. And with my voyce vpon the Lorde, I wil both call and crye: And he oute of hys holy hyll, wyll heare me by and by. I layed me doune and quyetly, I slept and rose agayne: For why, I knowe assuredly, the Lord doeth me sustayne. I do not feare ten thousande men, that compasse me about: Aryse (O Lorde) my God I saye, saue me and bringe me oute. Thou smytest all thine enemies, euen on the heard cheke bone: And thou hast broken all the teeth, of ech vngodly one. Saluacyon doeth alonelye, belonge to God aboue: Bestowe therfore vpon thy flocke, thy blessinge and thy loue. The .iiij. Psalme. O God (my iustyce) that doest heare me, when I on the crye: And doest set me fre from trouble, heare me mercyfully. O mortall men, how longe wyll ye brynge my glory to shame? Howe longe will you loue vanitye, and seke lyes and false fame? And knowe that the Lorde hath chosen for hymselfe the godly: And that he wyll geue eare to me, when I shall to him crye. Synne not, but stande in awe therfore, &amp; examine your herte: And in your secrete chamber se, you do youre selfe conuert. Offer to God the sacrifice of righteousnes I saye: And loke that in the lyuyng God ye put your truste alwaye. Many men saye, who wyl geue vs wordly goodes and substaunce? And for to se good fortune &amp; also prosperouse chaunce? But vpon vs thy poore seruauntes, Lorde lyfte thou vp a sygne: The lyght Lorde of thy countynaunce that doeth so clearly shyne. Yet when I sawe the greate encrease, of their corne and newe wyne. Thou madeste me reioyce in herte, and not there at repyne. In peace I shall bothe reste and slepe, I shalbe ful quyete: Because thou only art he that doeste me in salftie set. The .v. Psalme. Lord marcke my wordes and vnderstand, all my styl whisperynge: Heare me, for I wil pray to the that arte my God and kynge. Lorde thou wilt heare my voyce by tyme, and I will me applye: Unto the earlye in the morne, and loke on the onlye. For thou art not the God that doeth in wyckednes delyght: Neyther shal anye wycked thynge remayne wythin thy syght. The rageynge foles shal not consiste and stande before thyne eyes: For thou hast hated all suche men, as worcke iniquities. Suche as speake lyes thou shalt destroy, for the Lorde doeth withstande: The man that shedeth bloude, and that taketh disceyte in hande. But I wylcome into thyne house trusting vpon thy grace: And in thy feare wyll honoure the euen at thyne holy place. Lorde leade me forth in thy iustice for feare of myne enmies: And thyne owne waye defende thou Lorde before thy seruauntes eyes. For in their mouth ther is no truth, their inwardes are but dounge: Their throte is like an open graue, they flatter wyth their tonge. Proue them giltye (O God) and let them falle from their counselles: For their greate synnes dryue them awaye, for they haue bene rebelles. And let suche as do truste in the, synge &amp; reioyce alwaye: Let suche as loue thy name reioyce in thy defence I saye. For thou (O Lorde) doest blesse the iuste &amp; geue hym good thynges styll: And as a speare thy goodnes doeth enclose hym from all ylle. The .vi. Psalme. Lorde checke thou not thy pore seruaunt in thine hasty furie: Neyther correcte me in the heate of thy melancholye. Be mercyful to me! (O Lorde) for I am deformed: Heale thou me Lorde, because my bones are made sore abashed. But my soule is abashed sore: yea, &amp; ryght sore troubled: And thou (O Lorde) howe longe wilt thou se me so afflicted? Returne (O Lorde) set my soule cleare, saue me for thy mercye: For in death and the graue there is, of the no memorye. In my sorowfull mornynge I am weryed oute ryght: And with my teares my bed &amp; couch I make to flowe al nyght. My face is wrynckled throughe anger, &amp; indignacyon: And it is made exceadinge olde, throughe myne enmyes eche one. Departe from me all ye that be worckers of wyckednes: For the Lorde hathe hearde the voyce of my sorowfull dystresse. The Lorde hathe hearde hys seruauntes prayer and supplicacyon: The Lorde hath receyued my suite, and mine oracyon. Let all myne enemies take shame, and be caste doune greatlye: Let them be turned backe agayne, and take shame sodenlye. The .vij. Psalme. O Lorde my God I put my trust, and confidence in the: Kepe me from al that persecute me and delyuer me. Let not thys man snalch vp my soule, lyke a lyon rageynge: Neyther teare it when no man shall come to my rescuynge. Oh Lorde my God, I haue not done the thinge that they surmyse: Myne handes to any frowardnes I do not exercyse. Yf I haue done hurte vnto hym, that did peace wyth me take: Yea, wh? he vexed me causlesse, yf I did him forsake. Then let hym persecute my soule, and lay handes on the same: And let hym treade my lyfe to dyrte, and dyminyshe my fame. Aryse (O Lord) in thy fury, when my foes be styrred: Aryse to me wyth the iudgement that thou haste commaunded. And let the companye of al people stande the aboute: And therfore to go vp agayne do thou not stande in doubt. Let the Lorde iudge the nacyons, O Lord iudge me also: And after myne vpryght dealynge, so let it with me go. O ryghteouse God that arte searcher, of the hertes and the luste: Let the vngodlye mens synne cease, and gouerne thou the iuste. My shilde, my tergat and defence in God alone I fynde: That is the sauiour of th?, that are of godly mynde. God is a iust and vpright iudge, he is righteouse I saye: And God is moued wyth anger, and that euery daye. Yf Saule will not returne but make hys swerde ready to fyght: Yf he will bende hys bowe I saye and hym selfe to warres dyght: Yf he wyll prepare hym suche dartes, as wyl kyl presently: And frame his burnynge arrowes, that will pearse so myghtely: Lo, then he shall trauayle ryght sore, to brynge forth vanitye: For he hath conceyued greate gryefe, &amp; shall brynge out a lye. He hath trenched and dygged out, a dych for me to falle: But into the pytte that he made, he slyppeth fyrste of all. The care that he bent towarde me, shal lyght on his heade certayne: So shal y? force, wherwith he would oppresse me, turne agayne. After his righteousnes I will prayse the Lorde most myghtye: And right so wyll I synge to the name of the Lorde most hye. The .viij. Psalme. O Lorde, our Lorde, howe wonderfull is thy most holy name: Throughout the earth? that aboue heau?s thou spreadest out thy fame Thou haste brought strength oute of the mouth of babes and sucklinges yonge: For thy foes sakes, to weken them, that reuenge their owne wronge. But thyne heauens I wyl behold, thyne handiworckes I saye: The mone and starres that thou hast made, and prepared for aye. What thynge is mortall man that thou doest him neuer forget: And the sonne of man what is he, that thou doest him vyset? For vnto God thou hast made him litle inferiour: Thou hast compassed hym wyth suche glory, and suche honour. Thou hast made him lord of y? worckes that thyne handes haue formed: And eke all thinges vnder hys fete thou hast constytuted. Al flockes of shepe and droues of beastes, thou diddest to him geue: And eke the labouryng beastes that in the feldes do lyue. The foules that lyue in the ayre, with fyshes great and smalle: That lyue by the sea, and all thynges that passe by the sea walle. O Lorde that arte our Lorde I saye, oure mayster and our guyde: How wonderfull (Lord) is thy name, through oute the earth so wyde? The .ix. Psalme. I wyll set forth and prayse the Lorde with al myne herte in dede: And al hys wonderful worckes shal by my be declared. I wyll be glad &amp; eke reioyce in the (O thou most hye:) And to thyne holy name I wyl synge moste reioyceyngly. Whylse my foes shall be driuen backe, and caused to recoyle: They shall fal and peryshe before the, as m? made a spoyle. For thou art my iudgement and haste iudged all my debate: Thou ryghteouse iudge I saye thou hast sate on thy iudgement seate. Thou haste blamed the Heathen, and destroyed the wycked: And for euer also thou haste theyr name abolyshed. Now are thiwastes all at an ende, O thou fierse enemye: Wyth the cytyes that thou cuntest doune, gone is their memorye. But the Lorde doeth reygne for euer, hys kyngedome hath no ende: Hys iudgement seate is made ready, to iudge them that offende. And he shall iudge the rounde compas of the worlde by iustice: And emonge the people he shall geue vpryght sentences. The Lorde shalbe asure refuge vnto the oppressed: He shalbe a salfegarde I saye, when men be afflycted. Suche as haue knowne thyne holye name styke vnto the only: For thou (Lorde) doest not forsake them that seke the studyously. Synge to the Lorde that doeth abyde in the cyty Syon: Shewe hys counselles in eche people, and in eche nacyon. For he that doeth reuenge the slayne, shall none of them forget: Neyther the crye of suche men as are wyth troubles bysette. Be mercyfull to me (O Lorde) and do my trouble se: That of mine enmies I suffer, and fr? death lyfte vp me. That I maye tel all thy prayses in the gates of Syon: And I shalbe glad and reioyce in thy saluacyon. The Heathen stycke fast in the pytte that they haue prepared: And in the net that they haue hyd, their fote is entangled. The Lord is knowne by his iustice and the wycked tangled: Wyth the worckes of hys wycked handes, a thynge to be noted. The wycked and vngodly men shal slyde doune into hell: And all the Heathen that forget the God of Israell. For neyther shall the indigent be forgott? for aye: Nor the hope of the afflicted be alway vayne I saye. Aryse (O Lord) least mortal man, preuayle by mayne and myght: And let the heathen nacyons be iudged in thy syght. Lorde set a mayster ouer them, that maye kepe them styll thraulle: And let the heathen nacyons learne, that they be mortalle. The .x. Psalme. Lorde why standest thou so farre of? why doest thou not drawe nye? Why doest thou hide thy selfe in the tyme of our myserye? When the vngodly waxeth proud, the afflycted doeth smart: Let them be taken in the wycked counselles of their herte. For he prayseth the wicked man, for that he desyreth: The couetouse he calleth bleste, the Lorde he blasphemeth. In hys haute lokes the wycked man, setteth all thynges at nought: The God of myght is neuer founde in his vngodly thought. The lawes and constytucyons of God do greue him styl: At all ceasons they do wythstande his moste vngodly wyll. Thy iudgementes Lord are lifted vp, far hygh aboue hys syght: And agaynst all his enemies, he threateneth to fyght. He wyl thincke and saye in his herte, I wyll not bowe nor bende: From discommodities I wil my selfe euer defende. Hys mouth is ful of periurye, disceyte and vsurie: Oppressyon and vanitye do vnder hys tonge lye. In the courtes he layeth awayte, to kyll the innocent: And agaynste the multytude of the pore hys eyes be bent. Lyke as a lyon in hys denne, he wayteth in secrete: To take the afflycted, that is wyth myserye besette. That he maye take the poore I saye, that is in myserie: By drawynge hym into his net by crafte and subtyltie. Throughe hys force and hys violence is broken and opprest: The multytude of them that haue in mysery no reste. And in hys herte thus hath he sayde, God forgetteth certayne: Turnynge asyde hys face that he myght not se them agayne. O Lorde and God, aryse I saye, lyft vp thine hande and power: Forget thou not the afflycted, but do thou them succour. For why shoulde the vngodly men God in such sort blaspheme: And in their herte say that thou wylt not requyre it of them? But thou hast sene, for thou doest marcke vngodlynes and wronge: To put the same into thine hande, so myghtye and so stronge. The myserable multytude committe them selfes to the: For thou art wont to succour suche as wythoute succour be. Breake the vngodlyes arme, &amp; thou shalt seke the wycked man: And hys vngodlynes, and shalt fynde neyther of them than. The Lorde is kyng for euer more, and wh? all is ended: And from hys lande all the heathen people haue peryshed. Lord thou haste heard the poore mens cry, and wylt gouerne their hert: And vnto them thyne eare thou wilt dilig?tly conuert. That thou mayst reuenge the pupyl, and the poore oppressed: That h?seforth the lyke be not by mortal m? attempted. The .xi. Psalme. In the Lorde haue I put my truste, how to my soule saye ye: Oute of youre mount euen as the byrd, se that thou awaye flee? For lo, the wycked bent their bowe, and set their shaftes therin: That in the darcke they myght shote them, that in herte do not synne. Seynge the nettes be broke therfore, and the lawes set at nought: What coulde the iust man do therin, though he toke care and thought? But the Lorde in his holy place hath hys throne in heauen: His eyes beholde, and his eye leddes do serch the sonnes of men. The Lorde alloweth the iuste man, but he hateth deadly: The wycked, and suche as do loue force and iniquitie. Upon the wycked he wyll rayne snares, fyre and brymstone: And eke a stormye burninge wynde, thys is their lotte eche one. Because the Lorde him selfe is iuste, he loueth ryghteousnes: And with hys countenaunce he wyl loke vpon the gitles. The .xij. Psalme. O Lorde do thou saue and kepe nowe, for frendshyppe theris none: The true and faythfull of promyse are from emonge men gone. Wyth his neyghbour eche man speaketh wordes disceytfull and vayne: Wyth smoth lyppes, but with double hertes they speake to them certayne: The Lorde shall cut of al suche lyppes as speake fayre, but falsly: And the tonge that speaketh greate thinges her selfe to magnifye. All suche (I say) as do saye thus, let oure tonges be walkinge: Our lyppes are on oure syde, and who is our Lorde or our Kynge? The Lorde shall saye, now wyll I ryse, for the destruccyon: Of the oppressed, and the nedies lamentacyon. And them I will restore to healthe, they shal not be oppreste: I wyl geue them a breathynge tyme, &amp; eke a quyete reste. The Lordes sayinges are pure sayinges, as syluer well tryed: That in an earth? coffen hath ben seuen tymes wyll fyned. O Lorde do thou saue and kepe them, kepe backe the flatterar: Oute of thys generacyon kepe hym backe for euer. For when m? of most wicked lyfe do reigne and rule the route: Then do the vngodly wander on eche syde rounde aboute. The .xiij. Psalme. Lorde howe longe wylt thou forget me? what for euer and aye: Lorde how long wylt thou hyde thy face from thy seruaunt I saye? How longe shall I consult in mynde, and in myne hert trauayle? Howe longe shall myne enmies agaynst thy poore seruaunt preuayle? Loke backe and answere me (O Lorde) illumyne thou myne eyes: And suffer me not in the death to sleape in any wyse. Leste myne enmye shoulde say, I haue agaynste him preuayled: And suche as vexe me, should reioyce, yf I were weakened. But I truste in thy greate goodnes, and bountiful mercy: And in thine health mine hert therfore reioyceth certaynely. I will synge to the Lorde I saye, with hert vnfaynedly: Because he doeth requyte to me all thynges aboundantly. The .xiiij. Psalme. The folyshe and Insipient, whose thoughtes are euer vayne: Do in their hert saye folishly, there is no God certayne. They folowe wayes that are corrupt and abhomynable: There is none that doeth the thinge that is good and laudable. The Lorde loked doune from heauen vpon the sonnes of men: To se, yf there were anye wyse or to seke God geuen. But al had fallen and were corrupt together in their waye: There was no man that woulde do good, no not one man I saye. What knewe they nought? al are wicked, they eate my flocke as breade: And on the Lorde they do not call, in them there is no dreade: There shall they be cast doune with feare the Lorde wyll them affraye: For God is in the nacyon of the iuste men for aye: Ye do deryde and laugh to scorne, the co?sell of the poore. Because the Lord is his whole trust, his help and his succour. Oh woulde to God Israell myghte haue health out of Syon: Woulde God, I saye, the tyme were come of their saluacyon. That God myght bryng his flocke againe oute of captyuytie: That Iacob myght reioyce, and eke Israell be mery. The .xv. Psalme. Lorde, who shall haue hys dwelling place, in thy tabernacle? Who shall, I saye, fynde quyete rest in thy most holy hyll? That shall the man that walketh ryght, and doeth that vpryght is: And he that in his hert to speake the trueth do neuer mysse. He doeth not slaunder with hys tonge, nor do hys neyghbour ylle: Neyther doeth suffer him to be reuyled by his wyll. The wicked and the reprobate, are aye vyle in hys syght: But suche as feare the Lorde, he doeth honoure both daye and nyght. And yf heswe are or make promyse concernynge any thinge: Thoughe it shoulde be hys hynderaunce, to passe he wyll it brynge: He setteth not hys money out, to vsury or gayne: Nor taketh anye brybe to put the innocent to payne. Who so he be that wyll these thinges diligently apply: The same shal neuer threat to falle, but st?d vp styll stoutly. The .xvi. Psalme. Saue me (O God) do thou vouchsalfe my defender to be: Saue me I say, because I haue put my whole trust in the. Unto the Lorde thus haste thou sayde (O my soule within me:) Thou arte my Lorde, and my goodnes nothinge can be lyke the. Wyth the sainctes that dwel in the earth and men of noble fame: I am delyted, and wyth al myne hert I loue the same. Thoughe men do encrease their Idoles &amp; multiplye them styl: And gredily seke for to haue other mens godes at wyl: Yet will I not tast the cup of their bloudy sacryfyce: Nor with my mouth reherse the name of th? in any wyse. The Lorde is the porcyon of my part and cuppe certayne: O Lorde, my lot and heritage, thou doest alwaye sustayne. The coardes that measured my parte, in pleasaunt places fell: Yea and a noble heritage chaunced to me ryght well. The Lorde that hath ben my succour and counsell will I prayse: For my verye reynes do enstructe me in the night alwayes. I do prepone and set the Lord alwaye before myne eyes: He is styll at my right hande, leaste I fall in anye wyse. Wherfore myne herte shalbe ryght glad, so shall my tonge reioyce: And my fleshe shal reste in safetye, wythoute tumult or noyse. For thou shalt not forsake my soule at the sepulcherssyde: Nor suffer that thine holy one do into the pit flyde. The path of lyfe thou wylt shewe me, and full ioy in thy syght: And the pleasures at thy ryght h?d for euer daye and nyght. The .xvij. Psalme. Lorde heare the thynge that rightuouse is, geue eare vnto my crye: Marcke wel y? prayer that I make to the vnfaynedly. Let my iudgment procede from the, iudge me Lorde in thy syght: And let thyne eies consyder well, all suche thynges as are ryght. Thou hast searched myne hert throughly, and visyte me by nyght: Thou haste tryed me, yet canste thou not, blame any thynge by ryght. For the secret thoughtes of myne herte, &amp; my wordes do agre: The secrete thoughtes &amp; open wordes, are all one thinge in me. In the affayres of mortall men, I haue taken good hede: Of the wayes of the destroyer, for that thou haste preached. Grounde thou my steppes therfore, I say, Lorde in thy fote pathes all: Leste that my fete should siyp and I shoulde be redy to falle. On the I call (O God) for thou arte wout to graunt to me: Geue eare to me and heare my worde, Lorde God I beseche the. O thou that by thy powr kepeste, suche as do trust in the: From theyr enmyes, make thy mercies wonderfull vpon me. Kepe me as the eie apple, and vnder thy wynges me hyde: From the wicked that vse to waste, and my foes on eche syde. Wyth theyr fatnes and greate richesse, my wayes they haue stopped: And wyth theyr mouth presumptuouselye, proude wordes they haue framed. Euen nowe they do beset our wayes and eke compasse them rounde: And ernestly they do seke to stake theyr nettes to the grownde. Myne enmye is as the ly?, that rampeth for hys praye: And as the lyons whelpe that doeth lurcke in his den I saye. Arise (O Lord) preuent thou hym, cast him downe by thy myght: Set my soule free from the wycked, that is thy swerde to fyght. Set me free from these mortall men, that are thy powre and hand: Lord set me free from them whose mynde, to worldly thynges doeth stande. Set me free from them that do seke theyr portion in this lyfe: Out of thy storehouse fyll theyr mawse, therby to ende theyr stryfe. That theyr chyldr? maye haue wherwith them selues to satisfie: And that there maye be some what lefte to theyr posteritie. But I wyll loke vpon thy face in ryghtuousnes in dede: And when I shall ryselyke to the, I shall be satisfied. The .xviij. Psalme. Out of myne in moste bowelles Lord and from my verie herte: I wyl loue the, for my whole powre and only strength thou art. The Lorde is my castell of stone, and eke my fyghtynge toure: My rescuar and eke my God, and my rocke of succour. To hym I wyll cleaue and styke faste, he is my shylde in dede: And also the horue of my health, &amp; sure castel at nede. The Lorde that is worthy of prayse, I wyl aye calle vpon: And I shall be preserued from, myne enimies ech one. The bandes &amp; great sorowes of death had compaste me about: And the swifte streames of wycked men, had fearde me wyth theyr route. The cordes and sorowes of the deade, had gyrded me certen: So had the snares of death it selfe, me sone ouertaken. Whylse I therfore stode this in doubt and knewe no remedye: Wyth herte I dyd call on the Lorde, and to God dyd I crye. And out of his holy temple, he hearde my voyce streyght waye: Euen as sone as my crye was entred his eares I saye. He was moued and then the earth dyd shake excedyngly: The bottomes of hylles were shaken, because he was angry. At hys nosthyrles there yshued smoke, and at hys mouth fyre hotte: In such maner that at the same, coles were kenled I wotte. He bowed the heauens and so came downe by hys wonderfull myght: And vnder hys feete was dearcknes, &amp; the daseynge of syght. On Cherub he was caried, &amp; flewe forth as I fynde: Beynge borne vp and sustayned, by the wynges of the wynde. Lyke a tent, for hys closet he set dearcknes on eche syde: Nygh vnto hym, and blacke waters, wyth cloudes boeth thycke and wyde. Through the excedyng greate bryghtnes, that in hys presence was: Great hayle and burnynge coles also, dyd thorowe hys clowdes passe. The Lorde dyd thunder from heau?, and the moste hygh dyd speake: Great hayle and also burnynge coles, out of hys cloudes dyd breake. He shot forth shaftes &amp; scattered, hys foes and dyd them wounde: And moch lyghtnynge wherwith he dyd cast them flatte to the grounde. Then were the moste depe places, of the seas made ryght open: The wonderfull depe seas, I saye, whither the waters renne. And at the checke thou gauest them, Lord when thou waste angred: The bases and grownd worckes of the earth were vncouered. But from heau? the Lorde sent downe his hande and set me free: And out of most myghtie waters, by force he dyd drawe me. He set me free from deadly foes that were myghtye and stronge: And from my spytfull enimies, that were my maysters longe. These dyd preuent me in the tyme, of my calamitie: But the Lorde was my leaneynge staffe, and sure poste to stand by. He brought me forth into a place, wyde &amp; full of pleasure: And set me free because he dyd beare to me greate fauour. The Lord requited me my mede, after my ryghtuousenes: And gaue to me rewarde after myne h?des vngyltines. For the ways of the Lorde I dyd, alwayes kepe and obserue: And fr? my God I dyd neuer declyne a syde nor swarue. For in my syght all his decrees, and lawes I do holde faste: And the maners that he doeth teach, from me I do not caste. Before hym do I leade my lyfe pure and vndefiled: And so I kepe myself that I do nought that is wycked. The Lorde therfore requiteth me, as my lyfe is vpryght: And as myne handes are innocent, and gyltlesse in his syght. Thou wylt shewe mercie vnto hym, that doeth studie mercie: And wylt be faythfull to suche as do in dede faythfully. To the curteise thou art gentyll, but vnto the frowarde: That walke crokedly, thou also geuest alyke rewarde. For people that be afflicted, thou doest preserue and kepe: And eies that are loftie thou doest pul downe and cause to wepe. And thou (O Lord) arte he that doest geue my candle hir lyght: And my Lord God is he that doeth make all my dearcknes bryght. For in the do I breake thorowe the armed armayes all: And in my God (I say) I do, leape quite ouer the walle. The waye of God is wythout spot, and the Lordes worde is pure: And to all them that trust in hym it is a targate sure. For whoe is it bysydes the Lorde, that is a God of myght? Or who is it bysydes our God, that is a rocke sure pyght? The same is God that teacheth me, to be myghtie in wars: And maketh my waye expedite, in martiall affares. He maketh my fete lyke the fete, of the hyndes that are swyfte: And he it is that placeth me on hygh in my stepe clyfte. He doeth enstructe myne handes to warre and teacheth me that skyll: He geueth me strenght in myne armes, to breake a bowe of stele: Thou hydst me wyth thy shylde of health, thy powre doeth me sustayne. And of thy goodnes causest me ouer many to reygne. My steppes and my path vnder me, thou haste made large and wyde: Leste my ioynctes should stacker and then it myght chaunce me to slyde. I persecuted myne enemyes, and dyd th? apprehende: And dyd neuer returne tyll I, had brought them to theyr ende. I wounde them in such sort that they can neuer ryse agayne: And vnder my fete they do fall, as men that are quyte slayne. Thou doest enstruct me vnto warre, wyth the powre martiall: And when any ryse agaynst me, thou castest them downe all. Thou causest that my deadly foes, do turne theyr backe to me: And that I maye destroy al them that myne enimyes be. They cald and cryed but ther was none, that would them kepe or saue: Unto the Lord they cryed, I saye, and he no answere gaue. I pounde them lyke vnto the duste, that wyth the wynde doeth flye: So do I breake them lyke the dyrt, that in the streate doeth lye. From the peoples contentions, Lord thou doest set me free: Thou makest me heade of nations, strange people do serue me. So sone as they heard wyth theyr eares they dyd to me apply: Strayngars sonnes submitted them selfe vnto me faynedly. The strayngars wythered awaye, theyr freshe courage dyd fall: And in theyr secrete closettes they were sore amased all. Let the Lorde lyue and let hym be praysed that is my staye: And let the God of my soule health, be extolled I saye. It is God that geueth me powre, for to reuenge my wronge: And that doeth subdue vnto me, peoples mightie and stronge. It is God that doeth leade me out from my deadly enmies: Lord thou doest brynge me vp from th? that do agaynste me ryse. And from the man that doeth purpose me wronge and violence: Thou doest deliuer me I saye wyth carefull diligence. And for this cause (O Lorde) I wyll, in the Heathen prayse the: And wyll synge to thyne holy name, wherso euer I be. And for the greatnes of the healthe, and prosperouse lyueynge: Wherwyth thou doest enrych Dauid, thyne owne anoynted kynge. And for the health wherby thou doest with benefites applye: Thyne annoynted Dauid and eke his seede eternally. The .xix. Psalme. To vs the heauens dooe declare, goddes wonderfull glorie: And the c?passe therof doeth shewe hys handworcke trulye. The daye that succedeth shal teach vs yet a lytle more: And the nyght folowynge shall shewe more then that went before. They haue no maner of language, nor wordes sowndynge wyth noyse. They speake not as men vse to speake, no m? doeth heare theyr voyce. Yet went theyr rule through out y? world, all men haue heard theyr sounde: And theyr wordes went into the coastes, of all the worlde sorownde. In these heauens the Lorde hath sette, a dwellynge place and tent: For the sunne that wyth his bryght beames, is alwaye resplendent. And as a brydgrowme he commeth out of his bower bryght: Ryght cherfully to renne his rase, lyke to a man of myght. At the vtmost parte of the easte, he doeth his rase begynne: And in the vtmoste of the weste, is hys returnynge in. And vnder the heauens that be so wonderfull and wyde: There is not one that from his heate may hym absent or hyde. The Lordes lawe is pure and perfect, turnynge the soule to it: Sois hys testimonye true, geueynge the simple wytte. The decrees of the Lord are streyght, and make a mans herte lyght: So is the Lordes precept most pure, &amp; maketh the eies bryght. The feare of the Lorde is right pure, and doeth euer excell: So are his iudgmentes true and iuste, this do I knowe right well. They are more to be desyred, then plentie of pure goulde: And sweter then the honie combe, that droppeth many folde. Yea in them thy pore seruant is chiefly admonished: And in the obseruance of them, much hyre is promised. Whoeis able to marke his fautes, &amp; them to vnderstande? To purge me from my secrete fautes, Lorde do thou take in hande. And put from me all greate mischiefes, leste they ouercome me: And then from all greate treaspases, I shall innocent be. O Lorde that art my sure defence, &amp; doest reuenge my ryght: Let my wordes and thought of myne herte be pleasant in thy syght. The .xx. Psalme. I besech God the Lord heare the, in all thy miserie: And that the name of Iacobs God do place the in safetie. And that he helpe and succour the, from his sanctuarie: And that out of Sion he do vnderset the surely. And that he do remember all thy gyftes or sacrifice: And that thy fat br?t offeringes, be pleasant in hys eies. God graunt he geue the thy desyre, euen as thyne hert doeth wyll And that all thy mynde and counsell he do throughly fulfyll. Then wyth syngynge we wyll reioyce in thy saluation: And wyth triumphe set vp bannars in oure goddes name anone. For the Lord wyll fulfyll al thy requestes, this is no naye: And then shall eche man in his herte breake out in wordes and saye. Nowe I acknowledge that the Lord, hath preserued hys kynge: And hath heard hym out of heauen where he is abydynge. I acknowledge he hath heard hym out of hys holy place: By the saueynge strength of his powre, and his plentifull grace. Let some put theyr trust in charettes, and some in horses hye: Yet the name of the Lorde our God wyll we speake of trulye. They fell vnderneth theyr burden, &amp; were quite destroyed: But we stode styfly vnder it, and were styll strengthened. The Lorde shall aye preserue and kepe his owne anoyted kynge: And in the daye when we shall call he shall geue vs hearynge. The .xxj. Psalme. Lorde in thy myght and powre the kynge shall be glad and merie: And in thy saueyng health he shall reioyce excedyngly. Thou haste geuen hym his hertes desyre, wythout any delay: And of the thynges he hath asked thou hast not sayde hym naye. Wyth the beste and most pleasaunt gyftes thou haste hym preuented: And ryght so wyth a crowne of goulde, hys heade thou hast crowned. He asked lyfe of the and thou haste geuen to hym certayne: Such lenght of dayes that he shall be, when no tyme shall remayne. Through the health that thou gaueste hym, ryght great is hys glorye: Upon him thou hast set honour, &amp; bryghtnes great plentie. Thou haste set hym that he hath aye plentye and aboundaunce: Of all good thynges, so doest thou chere him wyth thy comtenaunce. For in the Lord the kyng putteth, his trust vnfaynedly: And shall stande stydfastly through the goodnes of God most hye. Thyne hande hath founde all suche men as, thy deadly enmies be: And thy ryght hande hath founde all such, as euer hated the. Lyke a fornayce in thyne anger, thou hast them all kenled: The Lorde hath eate them in hys Ire, fyre hath them consumed. The fruyte of theyr bodies thou haste rowted out of the land: And haste not suffered theyr seede emonge men for to stand. For they went obout to noye the, and for to do the yll: They inuented suche wyckednes, as they could not fulfyll. But thou madest them as a but, to shote at wyth thy bowe: And wyth thy strynge thou leuelledste euen at theyr face I knowe. Extolle thy selfe Lorde in thy powre, set vp thy selfe on hye: Then shall we synge and celebrate thy powr most worthyly. The .xxij. Psalme. My God, my God, why dydest thou, forsake thy pore seruant? From myne health &amp; my roreynge crye, howe far art thou distant? By daye I call on the my God, but no answere I heare: And eke by night, but vnto me no silence doeth appere. Yet art thou the holye rular of prayse in Israell: Thou art, I saye, the holy one that emonge them doeth dwell. Our fathers haue trusted in the, thou haste ben all theyr staye: They haue trusted in the and thou haste set them free I saye. They haue cried to the I saye, and are deliuered: They haue put all theyr trust in the, and are not ashamed. As for me I am but a worme, I am no m? in dede: I am an opprobrye of men, of people despised. So manye as do loke on me, do laugh at me alwaye: They mocke, they mowe and moue theyr heades, and with them selfe they saye. He hath lette all thinges to the Lorde, let hym set him at large: And for the loue he beareth hym, let the same him discharge. But thou art he (O Lorde) that haste oute of the wombe drawne me: And in my suckynge dayes I dyd put all my trust in the. From the daye of my byrthe I haue bene lefte to the onlye: And from my mothers wombe thou hast ben my God certaynely. Do not withdraw thy selfe farre of, be not from me absent: For there is no man for to helpe and trouble is present. Greate bulles haue compassed me rounde wyth an vnruly route: And myghtye men of Basan haue beset me round aboute. Against me haue they opened their mouth wonderfull wyde: Lyke as a lyon that rampeth and roreth in hys pryde. I am poured out like water, my bones are set aparte: And as the wax that is molten, so is in me myne herte. My strength dryeth vp lyke a shell, and my tonge cleaueth faste: To my chekes, and into the duste of deathe brought me to haste. Dogges and ylle men haue me byset, and bounde me in their bandes: And as a lyon they haue gnawen my fete, &amp; eke myne handes. I myght haue numbred al my bones, they were sene so planely: But these men loke vpon me, and are delyted greatly. They haue diuided emonge them all my garmentes I wotte: And whyche of them shoulde haue my cote, they haue tryed by lotte. But thou (O Lorde) be not farre of, O my strength and my powre: Make haste (O Lorde) thy poore seruaunt for to helpe and succoure. Delyuer my soule from the sworde, and let not me be torne: Wyth madde dogges, nor with lyons teeth, nor wyth vnicornes horne. Thyne holy name will I declare to my brethren eche one: And prayse the in the middle of the congregacyon. All ye that feare the Lorde, prayse hym, prayse him all Iacobs seede: And all the seede of Israel, feare ye the Lord in deede. For the poore mans afflyctyon he hath not neglected: Neyther turned away hys face, but hearde, when he cryed. Beynge in a great concyon, I prayse the Lorde onely: And in their syghte that do feare hym, my vowes perfourme will I. The poore &amp; the abiect shal eate, they shal al haue their fyll: Suche as seke the Lorde, shal prayse hym, &amp; their herte shall lyue styll. And all the quartars of the earth, shall haue remors of mynde: And shal conuert them to the Lord, as reasone doeth them bynde. All the housholdes and families that on the earth be founde: Shall humble them before hys face, and lye flat on the grounde. For vnto the Lord only al kingedom doeth appertayne: And emonge the heathen people the Lorde hym selfe doeth raygne. The fat and welthy of the earth, shal eate and do worshype: And all mysers shal bowe to hym, because he doeth them kepe. All such shal bowe their knees to hym, as do fall in the duste: Because he kept their lyfe, when that they sayed, nedes dye we muste. The ofspringe and posteritie shal him serue and obeye: And for euer more vnto him their trybute shal they paye. To the people that is not borne, they shall resort and tell: Hys iustyce and hys equyte because it doeth excell. The .xxiij. Psalme. The Lord is my sheperde, and I shall neuer stand in nede: For in pasture exceadinge good, he leadeth me to fede. He causeth me to laye me doune in pasture full of grasse: And dryueth me to caulme waters, that be so cleare as glasse. He calleth my soule backe agayn, and causeth me to make: My iourney in the waye of ryght, for his holy names sake. Thoughe I shoulde go through the valey of the shadowe of death: I wilbe withoute feare of yll, all the dayes of my breath. For thou arte aye present with me, thou doest me not forsake: Thy rodde and staffe do comforte me, and do me merye make. Ouer agaynst my foes thou wylt spreade a table for me: Annoynte myne heade wyth oyle, and fyl my cuppe with greate plentie: But let thy mercyfull goodnes folowe me all my lyfe: And then shall I dwel in thyne house wythoute debate or stryfe. The .xxiiij. Psalme. The earth and al that it holdeth, do to the lorde belonge: The world and al that dwel therin as wel the olde as yonge. For it is he that aboue al the seas hath it founded: And that aboue the freshe waters hathe the same prepared. Who is it, that shal ascend vp, into the lordes mountayne? And who shal in his holy place abyde styl and remayne? That shall the man with giltlesse handes and hert pourged throughly: Who doeth not geue his mynde, nor swere to fraude nor vanitye. The same shall receyue of the Lorde blessinge and al encrease: And of hys God and sauyoure he shal haue ryghteousnes. This is the nacion of them, that seke the Lorde I saye: It is the seede of Iacob, that seketh his face alwaye. Lyfte vp youre heades and ope ye gates, and ye dores eternall: And then that moste gloriouse kynge shall passe in at you all. Who is that kynge so gloryouse? the Lorde stronge and myghtye: The Lord that is moste noble in the powre of chyualrye. Lyfte vp your heades and ope ye gates, &amp; ye dores eternall: And then that moste gloryouse kynge shall passe in at you all. Who is that kynge so gloryouse? let vs knowe whiche is he: The Lorde of Hostes is that same kynge, so gloriouse to se. The .xxv. Psalme. O Lorde, to the I lyfte myne herte, my God I truste in the: Let me not take shame, leste my foes shoulde reioyce ouer me. Yea, Lorde let none that truste in the, be put to open shame: But let them that do fall from the, be put in all the blame. O Lorde, make thy wayes knowne to me, teache me thy lawes I saye: Do thou vse me vnto thy pathes, and trayne me in thy waye. Lorde, leade thou me forth in thy trueth, and by vse make me stronge: For thou arte God my Sauioure, whome I seke al daye longe. Remember thy mercyes (O Lorde) &amp; eke thy greate goodnes: For sence the worlde was fyrste create, they dyd yet neuer cease. Lorde beare not the synnes of my youthe any longer in mynde: But forget al the wickednes, that thou doest in me fynde. But for thy goodnes sake (O Lorde) I h?bly beseche the: Accordynge to thy greate mercye, be thou myndfull of me. The Lorde is good and eke rightwyse, no man can this denye: And therfore wyll enstruct synners in the waye certaynelye. He wil guyde the meke in iudgement, they shall do ryght I saye: And the lowly in spyryte he wyl accustome to hys waye. Al the wayes of the Lorde are founde mercye and trueth certes. To them that kepe his couenaunt, and hys testymonyes. O Lorde forgeue my wyckednes, for thine holy names sake: For myne iniquitie is greate, do not thou me forsake. Whoso feareth the Lorde, the same he wyl leade in the waye: That he hym selfe shall chuse, and wylbe his succoure and staye. Hys mynd shal tarye in good thinges, euer wythoute greuaunce. Hys seede also shall haue the earth for their enherytaunce. The Lorde shall make hys secrete knowne to them that do him feare: In lyke maner his couenaunt, shal vnto th? appeare. Upon the Lorde my God myne eyes are alwaye surely set: For he it is that doeth styll louse, my fete oute of the nette. Loke backe on thy seruaunt (O Lord) and take on me mercie: For I am succourlesse I saye, and in greate myserye. The sorowes and cares of myne hert are made moste large in deede: To leade me out of my trouble, Lord God do thou make spede. Lorde be holde myne afflyction, and eke mine heauynes: And take awaye from me my synnes and all my wyckednes. Consyder thou myne enemies, for they are ryght many: And wythall vyolent despyte they do hate me deadly. O Lorde, I saye, kepe thou my soule, and eke delyuer me: Let me neuer be put to shame, for I do truste in the. O Lorde, let perfectnes of lyfe, and equitie kepe me: Because I tarye for thy grace, and put my truste in the. O God redeme thou Israell and thy people eche one: From al their trouble and fr? al their greate afflyctyon. The .xxvi. Psalme. Iudge me (O Lord) because I haue walked innocently: And trusting in the Lorde, I shall stande vp moste stedfastly. O Lorde, do thou searche &amp; proue me, trye thou my renes and herte: For I beholdinge thy mercye will not from thy trueth stert. I do not syt emonge suche men as walke in vanitie: Neyther go I in vnto them that worcke disceytfully. The companye of wycked men I do hate moste deadly: And wyth the vngodly I wyll not sytin company. In innocencye wyll I washe myne handes wythoutten doubt And then thyne holy aultare (Lorde) I wyll compasse about. That I may speake the wordes of prayse and magnyfye thy name: And eke declare thy w?ders al, and thy w?derfull fame. The dwellynge of thyne house I haue loued most entierely: And the place of the tavernacle of thy great glorye. Gather thou not my soule emonge them, that dosynne in dede: Neyther my lyfe emonge suche men as loue bloude for to shede. In whose handes wyckednes is styll studied for before: And whose ryght hande is neuer voyde of brybynge gyftes great store: But I do walke innocentlye, I studie no mans ylle: Redeme me Lorde, and shewe mercye to thy poore seruaunt styll. My fote standeth in the streyght waye, I do not go astraye: In all companies I wyll prayse the Lorde of myght for aye. The .xxvij. Psalme. The Lord is my lyght &amp; mine health, of whome shoulde I feare take? The Lord is the strength of my life, who shoulde cause me to quake? Whylse ylle men set their men in raye, my fleshe for to deuour: Myne enmyes dyd stumble and fall, none coulde be their succoure. Thoughe whole armyes shoulde bysydge me, myne herte shall nothinge feare: And though warres shoulde growe agaynst me, yet woulde I not despeare. I haue axte one thynge of the Lorde, and wyll requyre the same: That I maye dwell all my lyfe tyme in hys house wythoute blame. That I may se the Lordes beautie, so w?derfull in syght: And walke about all hys temple, that is so goodly dyght. For in hys tent he wyll hyde me in tyme of myserie: He will hyde me in the secrete of hys tent pryuelye. He wyl lyfte me vp on the rocke, he wyll lyfte vp myne heade: Aboue my deadly enimyes, that haue me c?passed. I wyll offer sacryfyces in hys tente with syngynge: I wyl synge and reherse an hymne vnto the Lorde our kynge. O Lorde heare thou my voyce, wherwyth I do vpon thy call: Be mercyfull to me I saye, and heare my prayers all. For thy sake hath myne herte sayde thus, seke the Lorde, O my face: For I will endeuour (O Lorde) thy fauoure to purchase. Hyde not nor turne thy face from me, for thou art my succour: Leaue me not of nor forsake me, O God my sauiour. For when my father and mother forsake me vtterly: Then doeth the Lorde gather me vp, and kepe me in salfetie. Teache me thy waye Lorde, and lead me in a path that is ryght: For their sakes that lay wayte for me, to take me yf they myght. Geue me not vp to their pleasure, that wyth me be angry: For false wytnes stode agaynst me, &amp; threate me iniurie. Saue that I truste to se the pleasure of the Lorde of myght: In the lande of the lyuyng, I had dispeared out ryght. Loke for the Lord, truste in hym styl, make thyne herte stoute and stronge: And tarye for the Lorde I saye, reuenge not thyne owne wronge. The .xxviij. Psalme. O Lord my strength I crye to the., be not deafe, leste I be: Made lyke them that fall in the pyt, yf thou speake not to me. Heare the voyce of all my prayers, whilse I do on the crye: And lyfte vp myne handes towarde the dore of thy sanctuarye. Do not repute or reken me emonge the vngodly: Neyther emonge suche men as do commytte iniquytie. Numbre me not with them, I saye, that do speake peaceably: Wyth their neyghbours, but in their herte, do al myschiefe studie. Geue them accordynge to their worcke, let them be rewarded: Accordyng to the wyckednes that they haue studyed. Accordynge to their handy worckes so requite them their mede: And geue to them the iust rewarde that they haue deserued: Because they marckt not the Lordes workes, nor thynges made by his myght: He wyll caste them all doune agayne, and not buylde them out ryght. The Lorde of myght is moste worthy, to be alwaye praysed Because he hath hearde my request, &amp; hathe it accepted. The Lorde is my strength and my shylde, in him mine herte trusted: And I receyued helpe, wherfore myne herte is delyted. And with my songe I will prayse him, and eke his holy name: I will remembre his goodnes, and teache other the same. The Lorde is the strength of them all that to Dauid dyd clynge: Ryght so is he the saueyng health, of hys annoynted kynge. Preserue and kepe the people Lorde, and blesse thyne herytaunce: Feede them (O Lorde) and promote them, do them euer aduaunce. The .xxix. Psalme. Ascrybe vnto the Lorde all ye, that in strength do excell: Ascrybe glorye and honoure to the Lorde of Israel. Ascrybe all glorye to the name of the Lorde moste myghtye: Honour the Lorde in comlynes, most decent, and holy. The Lordes voyce is vpon waters , the gloryouse God thundreth: Wonders vpon many waters, the Lorde him selfe worcketh. The voyce of the Lord is in powre, without hym there is none: The Lordes voyce is magnificence, he doeth great thinges alone. The Lordes voyce breaketh Cedre trees, it breaketh them in twayne: The Lorde I saye breaketh the greate Cedre trees of Lybane: And he causeth them for to leape, lyke a stere or bullocke: Lybaine and Sirion as coltes of the vnicornes flocke. Greate flammes of fyre slyt insunder, the Lordes voyce shuteth oute: The manyfolde kyndes of lyghnynge are, the Lordes worcke no doubt. The Lordes voyce maketh the desert as of chylde to trauayle. The Lord maketh Cades deserte, to trauayl wythoute fayle. The Lordes voyce causeth hyndes trauayle, and maketh the wodes bare: But in his temple all men do prayse him with al theyr care. The Lorde sytteth in the deludge, that ouerfloweth wyde: He sytteth Lorde and kynge, I saye, &amp; doeth euer abyde. The Lord geueth hys people powre, them selfe for to defende: Mercye and peace to hys people, the Lorde doeth euer sende. The .xxx. Psalme. I wyl prayse the (O Lorde) because thou haste me broke and worne: But haste not suffered my foes, for to laugh me to scorne. O Lorde my God, in my sycknes I haue cryed to the: I haue called on the, I saye, and thou haste healed me. Lorde thou haste called my soule backe, fr? the brym of the pyt: And haste restored me, that I shoulde not fal into it. Ye that haue felt the Lordes mercye, synge a Psalme vnto hym: Set forth the memorye of hys holynes with an hymne. For his anger bydeth not longe, and when he is pleased: He geueth lyfe vnto ech man, that hath on hym trusted. Though they come home wepeynge at nyght wyth a sorowefull voyce: Yett in the morne cometh gladnes, they shal agayne reioyce. Certenly I sayde in this wyse in my prosperitie: I wyll neuer bowe nor yet bend, but stande vp styll stoutly. For thou (O Lorde) hadst placed strength on thy seruantes mountayne: But as sone as thy face was hyd, I was troubled agayne. Unto the my Lorde dyd I calle, in this myne heauie case: And dyd wyth moste erneste prayar, fall downe before thy face. What should my bloude profyte if I should go downe to the pyt? Shall dust prayse the? or shall thy trueth be declared by it? O Lorde, heare and graunt my requeste, be mercifull to me: O Lorde I saye be thou myne helpe I h?bly besech the. My wepynd and waylyng thou hast into a dawnce turned: So haste thou loosed my sakcloth, &amp; me wyth ioye clothed. Wherfore ech man shal synge to the, glorie wythouten staye: O Lorde my God for euer more I wyll prayse the I saye. The .xxxj. Psalme. O Lorde I trust in the alone, let me neuer haue naye: Delyuer me in thy iustice, when I do to the praye. Bowe downe thyne eare to me I saye, delyuer me outryght: Be my defence and sure castell, to saue me by thy myght. For thou art my rocke and sure ground &amp; my defence at nede: Wherfore for thy names sake leade me, and dryue me forth to fede. Brynge me out of the net that they haue layed and hyd for me: Because my myght and eke my strength, remayneth whole in the. Into thyne handes I do c?mitte my soule vnfaynedly: Thou haste redemed me, O Lorde, the God of veritie. I haue hated all suche men as do folowe vanitie: But in the Lorde I haue alwaye trusted vnfaynedly. Of thy mercie I wyll reioyce, thou that lokest on my payne: And that in my great miserie doeste not my soule disdayne. Neyther haste shette me in the hande or powre of myne enmie: But haste set my fote all at large, and at full libertie. Be mercifull to me (O Lorde) for I am sore oppreste: Myne eies dasle, and eke my soule and bealy take small reste. Sorowe freateth my lyfe awaye, mournynge bryngth my laste daye: My strength fayleth through wyckednes, al my bones waste awaye. All my foes and enmies haue made, a raylynge stocke of me: But chyeflye suche in verie dede as of my neyghbours be. My fryndes &amp; my famyliars haue hated me outright: And when they sawe me come abroade, they fled out of my syght. I was forgotten vtterly, as a man that is deade: So was I made lyke a vessell, that longe sence perished. I heard that many blamed me, and layde faultes to my charge Feare and tremblyng stode aboute I myght not walcke at large. Whylse they consulted togither, and dyd theyr wyttes employe: Howe to inuent awaye to take my pore soule subtylly. But I haue put my truste in y? (O Lorde) vnfaynedly: And wyth myne herte thus haue I sayde, thou arte my God truly. Lorde my lyfe dayes are in thyne hand, let me neuer be thrall: Set thou me free from myne enmies &amp; persequutours all. Lyghten thy countenaunce vp?, thy pore seruant I saye: And for thy mercifull goodnes, saue me wyth out delaye. O Lorde let me not aske in vayne, because I call on the: But let the wycked haue that shame, in the graue let them be. Let lyeynge lyppes haue nought to saye, which speake most craftily: And eke proudly agaynste the iuste, and most dispytfully. Ryght large are the good thynges that thou dost kepe for them that be: In thy feare, and that thou dydst in theyr syght that truste in the. Under thy face thou shalt hyde them, fr? all mens conspyrynge: From the debate of tonges thou shalt hyde them in thy dwellynge. The Lorde is worthy for to be praysed of olde and yonge: For notably he shewed me hys mercie in a towne stronge. When I fled hastily, I thought, I am caste of surely: But thou heardst the voyce of my prayer, when I dyd to the crye. All ye true seruantes of the Lorde, loue hym vnfaynedly: Whoe doeth defende the faythfull and plage the proude plentuousely. Be stronge and myghtie, for the Lorde wyl cause your herte be stronge: So many of you as do trust in hym boeth olde and yonge. The .xxxij. Psalme. That man is blest that is lyghted of hys transgression: And whose synne is hydde in the hope of hys saluation. The man is bleste to wh? the Lord doeth not impute hys synne: So is he bleste wythin whose breaste no disceyte doeth begyn. Whylse I do dayly with my self, sometyme thyncke secretly: And some tyme breake out wyth wepyng, my bones consume greatly. For nyght and daye thyne hande &amp; powre, lyeth vpon me heauie: My iuse and moysture are made lyke thynges that sommer doeth drye. But when I had tolde she my fault &amp; had not hyd my synne: And after that I had this thought, it is best I begynne: For to confesse vnto the Lord, all my transgression: Forth wyth thou dydst geue me of all my synnes remission. Wherfore ech goodman wyll praye the dureynge the tyme of grace: And the floude of the ragynge waues shall not come to hys place. Thou arte myne hydynge place and wylt, kepe me from miserie: And wylt beset me wyth the myrth of men that scape hardly. Thou hast sayde, I wyll teach the, in the waye thou shouldest go: And wyth myne eie and cleare knowledge, I wyll helpe the also. Be not lyke to the horsse or mule, that do nought vnderstande: Whose chawes thou must bynd wyth a bytte ere they folowe thyne hande. The sorowes of the wycked men, are ryght many in dede: But he that doeth stycke to the Lorde shall neuer stande in nede. Be glad in the Lorde (O ye iuste) &amp; reioyce in hys syght: Synge vnto hym so many as are in youre hertes vpright. The .xxxiij. Psalme. Reioyce ye iust men in y? Lord, prayse doeth good men beseme: Prayse ye the Lord wyth harppe &amp; lute, play on ten strynges to hym. Synge a newe songe, synge swete musick wyth blowynge of trumpet: For the worde of the Lorde is ryght, and all hys worckes sure set. He loueth iustice &amp; iudgment, these thynges please hym greatly: And the earth is replenished, and full of hys mercie. At his worde were the heauens made by hys wonderfull myght: And at the breathynge of hys mouth, all theyr armies so bryght. The waters of the sea he doeth, congregate as an heape: Right so in moste secrete closettes, he doeth laye vp the deape. Let all the earth and all that dwell in the worlde prayse the Lorde: Because all that he sayeth is done, all is made at hys worde. He disapoynteth the counselles of y? Heathen ech one: And doeth differ the subtyle thoughtes, of ech greate nation. But the Lordes counsell standeth styll, &amp; the thoughtes of hys herte: Do not decay but are fully fulfylled in eche parte. The people that hath the Lorde for theyr God hath ryght good chaunce: So hath the flocke that he hath chose for his enheritaunce. The Lorde loketh downe from heauen, &amp; doeth all men behold: He loketh downe from his dwellynge boeth vpon yonge and olde. He hath made the hertes of all men togyther in hys powre: And vnderstandeth all theyr worckes, euerie daye and houre. The kynge is not kept in saulftie, thorowe hys greate armye: Nor the strong man doeth scape daynger, because he is myghtye. The horse is a disceytfull thynge to be preserued by: Though he be stronge, for he shall not deliuer certaynely. Beholde the Lordes eye loketh on such m? as do him feare: So doeth it on suche as trust on hys mercye so tender. That he might delyuer their soules, out of the handes of death: And nouryshe them at suche time, as honger them oppresseth. Let oure soules (therfore) loke for him with all obedience: For he is oure helpe, and also the shylde of our defence. For in him shall our herte reioyce, because we do cleaue faste: Vnto hys holy name, whiche is our comforte and repaste. Lorde, let thy mercyful goodnes vpon thy seruauntes be: Euen as by truste and confydence we do depende of the. The .xxxiiij. Psalme. At all tymes and ceasons I wyll prayse the Lorde God certayne: For in my mouthe hys holy prayse doeth euer more remayne. My soule shal glorye in the Lorde, and in none other thynge: Whych when the afflicted shall heare, they shall make reioyceynge. Se that wyth me you magnifie, the Lord that is aboue: Let vs prayse hys name togither, as reasone doeth vs moue. I sought the Lorde diligently, &amp; he heard my requeste: And from al feare that I was in, he hath set me at reste. Men shall loke backe to hym &amp; shall renne to hys companie: Theyr faces shal not blushe for he wyll none of them denie. The Lord hearde this afflicted man when he dyd on him crye: And then he dyd preserue and kepe hym fr? hys miserye. The angell of the Lorde doeth pytch hys tentes about them all: That ieare the Lorde and doeth set cleare, such men as erste were thrall. Taste and see that the Lorde is good, and full of all mercie: The man is blessed that doeth truste in hym vnfaynedly. O ye saynctes of the Lorde feare him, and do hym reuerence: For to such as feare hym ther is no nede nor indigence. The yonge lions, and fierse tyrannes, suffer honger and nede: But such as seke the Lorde shall haue, good thynges plentie in dede. Drawe nere my sonnes, drawe nere I saye and geue to me good eare: Come vnto me, I saye, for I wyll teach you the Lordes feare. Whoe so thou be that doeste desyre to lyue and good dayes see: Loke that in thy tonge and thy lyppes, none ylle or disceyte be. Flee from yll and do that good is, where of commeth no blame: Seke thou for peace diligently, &amp; then ensue the same. Upon the iuste man the lordes eies are ful fyxed and bent: And hys eares to the prayars of such as be innocent. But his sterne lokes are bent on th?, that do worcke wyckedly: That out of the arth he maye cutte theyr fame and memorie, The iuste men crye, and the Lorde doeth heare and graunt theyr prayer: And out of all theyr myseries he doeth them deliuer. The Lord is styll redie at hande with them that do repent: And kepeth them, whose spirite is to repentaunce styll bent: Many yuelles &amp; misfortunes do the ryghteouse man befall: But the Lorde doeth delyuer him, and ryd hym of them all. And all the bones of his bodye the Lord kepeth certayne: So that not one emonge them al can be broken in twayne. But yll chaunce and mysfortune shall destroye the vngodly: And suche as hate the iuste, shalbe destroyed vtterly. And the Lorde shall redeme the lyfe of hys true seruauntes all: And of them that do trust in hym none shall peryshe or fall. The .xxxv. Psalme. Take thou my stryfe in hande (O Lorde) assaute them that saute me: Take the to shylde and speare and ryse myne helper for to be. Pull out thy speare, come out to mete my persecutours fel; Saye to my soule, I am thyne health, thy matters shall go well: Let th? that seke my lyfe, take shame, and eke ignominie: Let them be dryuen backe wyth shame, that thyncke euyll vnto me. Let them be made lyke to the dust, that with the winde doeth flye: And let the aungell of the Lorde dryue them vyolently. Let their waye be darcke and slyprye, that they may slyde and fall: And let the aungell of the Lorde persequute them wyth all. For wythoute cause the pytte of their net haue they for me hyd: Ryght so a great trenghe for my soule, causeles they haue digged. Let the mysery that they did not fore se on them fall: And let the net, they hyd, take them, and let them be made thraule. But my soule shall greatly reioyce in the Lorde God for aye: She shall reioyce in hys salfe garde, and all my bones shall saye: O Lorde who is lyke the? that doest rescue the conquyred: And take the poore and nedye from him that hath hym forced? There dyd aryse fierse wytnesses, men violent in dede: And asked me of thynges, that I neuer Imagyned. They requited me euel for good, such was theyr cruell wyll: And for y? helpe they had of me, they sought me for to kyll. But when I hearde that they were sycke, and wyth disease greued: I ware sacke cloth, and wyth fastynge my soule I afflicted. The prayer that I made for them when they were in distresse: I woulde should lyght vpon myselfe in tyme of heauines. I went as though my faythfull frende or brother had dyed: As one that mourneth hys mother in blacke I was clothed. But in the tyme of myne haltynge when I was weakened: They dyd reioyce excedyngly and were congregated. The lame flocked agaynste me when I dyd thyncke nothynge lesse: And fr? theyr bytter raylynge wordes, they dyd then neuer cease. And the dissemblynge hypocrites, that do serue theyr bealy: Dyd grenne and gnashe theyr teeth at me, as men full of enuie. O Lorde howe longe wylt thou beholde, thys and suffer them styll? Rydde me from theyr oppression, and from theyr cruell wyll. Then wyl I celebrate thy name, in a grat companie: And will prayse the in a people that is strong and myghtie. Let them not reioyce ouer me, that causelesse my foes be: Neyther let them wyncke wyles wyth me, that wythout cause hate me. They speake no worde that shoulde brede peace, peace is not theyr intent: But agaynste the quiete they do disceytefull wordes inuent. They thruste out the mouth agaynste me, and storne fully they saye: Haha haha, our eie hath sene, this mans vtter decaye. And thou (O Lorde) haste sene this thyng do thou not dissemble: Neyther be thou far of from me, when they do assemble. Aryse, awake, that thou mayste iudge my cause as ryght doeth stande: My God &amp; Lorde, arise that thou maiste take my cause in hande. O Lorde my God, for thy iustice do thou geue me my right: And suffer them not to reioyce, ouer me in thy syght. Let them not saye thus in their hert, haha we haue our mynde: Let them not saye, we haue eate hym, let th? no suche cause fynde. Let them all take shame and rebuke, that of myne ylle reioyce: Cloth them wyth shame that speake againste me with a braggynge voyce. Let suche as woulde I had my ryght, reioyce greatly, and saye The Lorde that woulde hys serua?tes peace be magnifyed alwaye. And on my tong (Lord) thy iustyce shal sowne dylygently: And vpon thy most worthy prayse my tonge shal runne dayly. The .xxxvi. Psalme. The vngodlye mans wyckednesse testyfye thin myne herte: That of the feare of God there is in him no maner parte. For in hys owne conceyte he doeth stande wonderfully well: Tyll suche tyme as hys wyckednes doeth all hatered excel. Uniuste and disceytfull are the wordes of hys mouth eche one: And of the doctryne that doeth teache to do good, he wyl none. In hys bed he inuenteth synne, and doeth himselfe addresse: To walke forth in a wycked waye, he doeth no vice represse. O Lorde thy mercie is aboue in the heauens so hye: And aboue all the elementes thy trueth and veritie. Thy iustice is lyke great mountaynes, &amp; thy iudgmentes ryght depe: Boeth man and beaste thou wylt (O Lorde) alwaye preserue and kepe. Thy mercifull goodnes (O God) is ryght, famouse in dede: And to thy charge the sonnes of men haue them selfe committed. Through the greate pl?tie of thyne house they shall be druncke I thyncke: Of the streame of thy delicates, thou wylt geue them to dryncke. For the vene or fountayne of lyfe is in thyn hande or myght: And in thy bryghtnes thy seruauntes shall alwaye perceyue lyght. Spreade out thy mercie ouer them that do acknowledge the: And eke thy ryghtuousenes on them, that of vpright herte be. Let no fote of pryde come to me, make proude men from me flye: Let me not be moued by the powre of the vngodly. For em?g them such men as haue wrought wyckednes dyd fall: They were driuen magre a theyr heade, they had no staye at all. The .xxxvij. Psalme. Though thou se many wycked men, be not therfore angry, Neither do thou enuie them that do worcke iniquitie. For as the heye they are cut downe, full sodenly in dede: And as the florishyng grene grasse they shalbe sone dryed. Put thou thy truste in the Lorde and do the thynge that good is: Dwell in the lande and nourishe fayth, doynge no thynge amysse. And se thou do delyght thy selfe, in y? Lord God alone: And then shall he geue vnto the, thyne hertes petition. Caste thou thy waye vpon the Lorde, lett him gouernest styll: Leaue vpon him that he may do by the after hys wyll. Then shall he brynge thy ryghtuousenes abroade lyke a cleare lyght: And thy iudgementes and perfectlyfe, lyke as the myddaye bryght. Kepe thy thought secrete to the Lord, and wayte vpon hys wyll: Do not stomake the good successe, of the man that doeth ylle. Remitte anger wythout delaye, and let thy furie passe: Let not thyne anger be so greate, that thou committe trespas. For such as do euell shall perishe, &amp; be cut out doubtlesse: But they that wayte on the Lordes wyl, shal the earthe aye possesse. Yet a litle whyle and then the wycked shal be nowhere: And when thou lokeste toward hys place, ther shall no man appeare. In the meane tyme the afflycted, shall all the earth possesse: And shalbe throughly delited wyth prosperouse successe. Agaynste the iuste and godlye man, the wycked doeth inuent: And gnasheth at hym wyth hys teeth, hys wrath is so feruent. But the Lord laugheth hym to scorne, because he doeth forese: Hys laste daye &amp; destruction nygh at hande for to be. The wycked do drawe out theyr swerde and bende theyr bowe wyth myght: To cast downe the pore nedie slocke, and kyll them that go ryght. But theyr owne sworde shall pearse theyr herte, and stryke it thorowe quite: And all theyr bowes shalbe broken, they shal do vs no spyte. The lytle that the iuste man hath, is much better doubtlesse: Then the great richesse that the noble wycked men possesse. For the armes of the vngodly, shalbe brok? in twayne: But the iuste men the Lorde hym selfe, wyll vnderset certayne. The tyme also of innocentes, the Lorde knoweth right sure; And the enheritaunce of th? shall euermore endure. In the tyme of aduersitie, they shall suffer none ylle: And when the honger is moste greate, they shall aye haue theyr fyll. For the vngodly shall perishe, the Lordes enimies shall: Be wasted lyke preciouse lambes, smoke shall consume them all. The vngodlye renneth in det &amp; doeth not paye agayne: But the iuste man is liberall, and geueth muche certayne. For hys blessed chyldren shall haue, the earth by heritage: And hys curssed sorte shalbe cut out ere they come to age. The Lord ruleth a mans fotesteppes, and lyketh well hys waye: When he slydeth he falleth not, for the Lord doeth hym staye. I haue bene yonge and am nowe olde, yet the eies in myne heade: Dyd neuer se the iuste deserte, nor hys seede begge theyr breade. For he is dayly lyberall, &amp; doeth lend with good wyll: And his seede and posteritie, haue of al thynges theyr fyll. Flye thou from yll and do the thynge that is good and godly: And then thou maiste be sure thou shalt euer dwell pleasantly. For the Lorde loueth iuste iudgment, he doeth therin delyght: The wayes of them that do iustly are pleasante in hys syght. Hys saynctes he doeth neuer forsake, but kepeth them for aye: But the seede of the vngodly, he routeth out I saye. The iuste men shall possesse the earth by ryght of heritage: And shall inhabyte vpon it to the ende of all age. The iuste mans mouth doeth commune of wysedome and sapience: So doeth his tonge speake iuste iudgment wyth carefull diligence. In his hert the lawe of his God, is grounded and faste pyght: His fote steppes shall not bende nor bowe his lyfe shalbe vpright. The vngodly man layeth wayte and watcheth the iust styll: He seketh oportunitie hym to murther and kyll. But the Lorde wyll not suffer hym to fall into his hand: Nor to be founde wycked wh? he doeth at his triall stande. Truste in the Lord and marcke his waye, se that thou do not rage: And he shall the promote to haue the earth by heritage. And wh? the vngodly men shall be clearly routed out: Thou shalt se and beholde the same wyth reioycynge no doubt. I my selfe sawe a wycked man, full violent was he: And dyd sprede forth hym selfe as doeth the freshe buddynge baye tree. And the same passed by, and lo, he dyd no more remayne: I sought hym, but after that tyme he was not founde agayne. Obserue and kepe a perfect lyfe, and trust for that is ryght: For that man onlye that doeth so, shall haue peace in goddes syght. But the vngraciouse sorte shall all be destroyed no doubt: And at the laste the vngodly shalbe all routed out. The health &amp; salfgard of the iuste, is from the Lorde alone: Whoe is all theyr strength in the tyme of theyr affliction. The Lord shall helpe &amp; deliuer them from the vngodly: And shall kepe them, for in hym they haue trusted certenly. The .xxxviij. Psalme. Lorde checke thou not thy pore seruaunt in thyne hastie furie: Neyther correct me in the heate, of thy melancholie. For thy shaftes be fastned in me, they styck faste in my syde: And thy powre is more heauie on me then I maye abyde. Thorowe thy displeasure ther is in my fleshe nothynge sownde: And by meanes of my synne no peace to my bones can be fownde. For myne inequities do clyme ouer myne heade certayne: And as an heauye burden are more then I can sustayne. And through myne owne fonde folyshnes my byles are rankelled: And flowe out wyth matter that was in th? putrified. I go croked, well moste two folde, and am preste downe greatly: Euerie daye I walcke aboute wonderfull heauyly. For a fowle and moste fylthy byle, doeth couer myne hyppe bone: And in all the partes of my flesh, whole place do I fynde none. I am turmoyled and tossed and broken passynge sore: And the great sorowe of myne herte, maketh me crye and rore. O Lord thou doest all my desyre ryght wel perceyue and se: And the depe syghynges of myne herte, are not vnknowne to the. Myne herte beateth wythin my brest my strength hath me fayled: And the verie lyght of myne eies, is greatly decayed. My frendes and my famyliars, stand on the other syde: Ouer agaynste my wounde, and my neyghbours afarre of byde. In the meane tyme such as do seke my lyf laye snares warelye: And such as seke myne euell, speake euell, &amp; do disceyte applye. But I am lyke one that is deafe, and do heare nought at all: And lyke the dombe that doeth not ope his mouth to crye or call. I am lyke vnto the man that doeth heare nothynge certayne: Nor hath ought in hys mouth to make for him answere agayne. For I tarie for the (O Lorde) I put my truste in the: And thou (O Lorde) my God I saye, shalt make answere for me. For thus I thought (O Lorde) let not so great reioyceyng be: Emonge them that do when I slyde, make suche bragges agaynst me. For nowe it standeth so wyth me, that I muste lyue lame aye: And my sorowe can neuer go fr? me by nyght nor daye. For I do styll confesse my faute, and myne iniquitie: And for my synne I am troubled in herte excedyngly. But in the meane tyme myne enmies do lyue and be made stronge: And they encrease that wythout cause, hate me and do me wronge. And they that requite euell for good are agaynst me sore bent: Because I folowe the thynge that is good wyth full consent. Forsake me not (O Lorde my God) stande not for of from me: Make thou haste to helpe me (O Lorde) for myne health lyeth in the. The .xxxix. Psalme. Thus sayde I wyth my selfe &amp; thus I haue purposed longe: I wyll obserue my wayes that I offende not wyth my tonge. And whylse the wycked is present, I wyll my mouth restrayne: Euen as with a right stronge halter, or with a brydle rayne. Through longe silence I was so dombe that I coulde speake nothynge: Of good nor bad, yet in the meane tyme my sorowe dyd sprynge. Myne herte waxed hotte wythin me whylse I thus murmured: A certen fyre burned outryght, and then my tonge lowsed. Myne ende &amp; measure of my dayes (Lord) shewe to me playnly: That I maye knowe howe longe I, muste lyue in this miserie. Lo, thou haste appoynted my tyme much shorter for to be: Then an hand breadth, yea it is nought, compared vnto the. Certes the stouteste man of all, is of ryght small valure: Though to mens syght he seme to stande neuer so firme and sure. Man foloweth hys fantacie, and doeth folyshly rage: He heapeth vp not knowynge who shal haue his heritage. And nowe (O Lord) what thinge is it, that I loke for to haue? For truly myne hope lyeth on the, of the only I craue. Deliuer me from al vices and all thynges vngodly: And make me not a mockynge stocke to men full of follye. I was made dombe and spake no worde, my mouth I opened not: For thou thy selfe haste made me so (O my Lorde God) I wot. Take thou from me thy scorge therfore, plage thy seruant no more: For at the styrynge of thyne hande, I am amased sore. For when thou doest wyth chydynge wordes, chastise a man for synne Forthwyth all hys goodly beawtie to c?sume doeth begynne. And as the moth wasteth the cloth, ryght so Lorde doest thou than: Waste all that is comlye in hym, so vayne a thinge is man. O Lord hearken to my prayar, and geue eare to my crye: Be not deafe when I wepe to the, heare me mercifully. For I am a strainger wyth the, my dwellynge is not here: I am onlye a sogenar, as all oure fathers were. Turne a syde yet a whyle from me, that I maye recouer: Before I do departe from hense, &amp; be as one no where. The .xl. Psalme. After I had long loked for the Lord ryght carefully: At laste he dyd geue hede to me &amp; hearken to my crye. From that wretched pyt and thycke myre, he hath pulled me out: He hath set me vpon the stone, and made my fote steppes stoute. And in my mouth he hath set a newe songe prayse to our God: Which thynge many shall se and feare, and shall trust in the Lorde. That man is bleste that euer shall make the Lorde his defence: And shall not paue vpon the proude, nor men of lyght credence. O Lorde my God, thou hast wrought and done many thynges in dede: Thy wonderfull worckes done for vs, can not be numbered. Which if I shoulde once take in hande, to set forth and declare: Many moe then I can n?bre I knowe ryght well they are. Sacrifice and meate offeryng, thou doest not loue I knowe: But hast bored myne eares thorow, makyng me base and lowe. Thou haste made me thy bonde seruant, and haste not required: Brent offeringe nor sacrifice for synne to be offred. Then dyd I saye, beholde I am redie at hand wyth the: In the first pagine of the boke it is wrytten of me. I assent (O my God) to do all that thou doeste allowe: And in the myddes of my bowelles thy lawe is placed nowe. I haue preached thy rightuousnes, in a greate companie: Lo, I neuer forbade my lyppes, this knowste thou certenly. Thy rightuousnes I haue not kept, wyth in myne herte secret: Thy sure promises and thy health, I haue styll abroade set. I haue not ceased to declare, in a great concion: Thy goodnes and thy veritie, thy mercies Lorde ech one. Neyther doest thou kepe backe (O Lorde) from me thy mercies free: Thy goodnes and thy veritie, do euermore kepe me: Because innumerable euelles, had so oppressed me: My synnes dyd so possesse me that I coulde none of them see. They were many moe in number then the heares of myne heade: Wherfore myne herte hath fayled me, I became lyke one deade. Letit please the therfore (O Lorde) to set thy seruant fre: Make haste (O Lorde) do not tarie but come and succour me. Let them suffer shame and reproufe that seke my soule to kyll: And let them be dryuen backe wyth shame, that delyte in myne yll. Let them that saye haha, haha, to me in scornefull wyse: Be quite wasted because they dyd my rebuke enterpryse. Let such as do seke the, reioyse and eke be glad in the: And let them that loue thyne health saye, praysed myght the Lorde be. But I am afflicted and pore, the Lord careth for me: Thou art myne helpe and redemer, my God do not tarie. The .xli. Psalme. Happie is he that wyth the pore vseth hym selfe wisely: For the Lorde shall deliuer hym in tyme of miserie. The Lorde shall kepe hym, and to hym, he shall hys health restore: That on the earthe he may enioye pleasures yet a whyle more. For thou (O Lorde) doest not fauour thy pore seruant so yll: As to permitte hys enimyes to vse hym at theyr wyll. And lyinge in hys sycknes bed, thou shalt hym styll sustayne: And in hys weaknes thou shalt change all hys whole bed certayne. Wherfore do I also saye thus. O Lorde be good to me: Heale thou my soule, for I also haue synned agaynst the. Myne enmies curssed me and sayde, when shall we se hym dye? When shall hys name perishe and be put out of memorie? And when any of them came to me, full vaynely he spake: And thought euell in herte, but wh? he came abroade out it brake. Emonge them selues myne enimies, dyd whysper togither: Agaynste me, and thus dyd they thyncke on my mischiefe euer. Some greate myschyfe is fallen on hym, he shall perishe certayne: Syth he is layed sycke in his bed he shall not ryse agayne. Yea and my most familiar, whome I trusted greatly: And he that fed at my table, spurned me sodenly. Thou therfore Lord be good to me, shewe me mercie in dede: Set me vp on my fete that I maye requite them theyr mede. By thys thynge do I knowe my selfe in thy fauoure to be: Because my foes do not reioyce nor try?phe ouer me. And because I am innocent of lyfe thou wylt me staye: And wylt sette &amp; appoynt me in thyne owne presence alwaye. Let the Lord God of Israel be praised euermore: From tyme to tyme praysed be he, Am? saye we therfore. The .xlij. Psalme. Lyke as the hynde doeth crye after the swifte renneynge water: So doeth my soule crye vnto the (O God my redemer) My soule is thyrstie after God, the God that lyueth aye: Wh? at the laste shal I appeare before goddes face I saye? My teares haue bene my sustina?ce boeth by daye and by nyght: Whylse they haue dayly sayde to me, where is thy God of myght? So sone as I remembre howe I led them in a route: To the house of the Lord my God, my soule I do poure out. When I remember howe I led forth a greate companie: Syngynge and praysynge God, then doeth myne herte reioyce greately. O my soule why arte thou so sadde, and in me, so troubled? Truste in God, for I wyll thancke hym, for myne health receyued. O my God, my soule in my breste doeth dispear vtterly: Because I am compelled in the wyldernes to lye. Because I do rem?bre the beynge agaynst my wyll: In the land beyonde Iordayne and Hermonims lyttle hyll. One depenes calleth an other, as lowde as thy stremes renne: All thy floudes and thy stormes do passe ouer myne heade often. His mercifull goodnes the Lorde sheweth to me by daye: And by nyght I do syng &amp; praye to God that lyueth aye. Thus wyl I saye to God my strength why doest thou me forget? Why do I go in mournynge robes when my foes me byset? When my foes saye, where is thy God? &amp; reuile me dayly: It is as though they thrast a sworde into my bones fiersly. O my soule, why art thou so sadde, &amp; in me so troubled? Trust in God for I wyll prayse him, for myne health receyued. I wyll celebrate him I saye yet a whyle for myne health: And for that he seweth him to be, the God of all my wealthe. The .xliij. Psalme. Iudge me (O God) &amp; take my cause in hand and do me rydde: From a wycked people and from a man false and wycked. For thou my God, arte my whole powre, why haste thou put me by? Whye do I mourne when myne enmies do frete me cruely? Sende me thy lyght &amp; veritie, let them leade me the waye: Unto thyne holye hyll, and to thy dwellynge place I saye. That to goddes aultare &amp; to God, my ioye and reioyceynge: I maye enter, &amp; to my God I maye on myne harppe synge. O my soule whye arte thou so sadde, and in me so troubled? Truste in God for I wil prayse hym for myne health receyued. I wyl I saye celebrate him, for the health wherwyth he: Shall make me gladde and eke declare hym selfe my God to be. The .xliiij. Psalme. O God we haue hearde wyth oure eares our fathers haue vs tolde: The worckes y? thou dydest in theyr tymes, and in the verneyers olde. To plant them in, thou haste by force, dryuen the heathen out: Thou haste afflicted nations, but hast made these men stoute. They dyd not wynne the lande neither theyr health by theyr owne myght: But by thy powre &amp; thy fauoure that hadste in them delyght. And thou thyselfe (O God I saye) arte my Lorde and my kynge: Let the health of Iacob him selfe be at thy disposeynge. Through the we shall shake them of that vex vs in any wyse: And through thy name we shal neglect them that agaynste vs rise. I wyl not put my confidence, nor my trust in my bowe: For my sword or other weapon shall not saue me I knowe. But thou doest preserue and kepe vs from our aduersaries: And doest make them ashamed that do hate vs in such wise. In God we do dayly reioyce, in God we do glorie: And thy name do we celebrate (O God) eternallye. But thou hast caste vs of and hast brought vs to open shame: Thou goest not forth wyth our armies, nor doest prospere the same. Thou turnest vs to flyght before our enimies I saye: And they that hate vs moste deadly do carie home the praye. Thou haste appoynted vs as shepe, chosen to be kylled: And emonge Heathen nations thou haste vs scattered. Thou hast solde thy people for nought this do we se full well: Thou doest not reyse the price of th? settyng them out to sell. To be reuiled of oure neyghbours, thou doest set vs out: And makest vs a mockynge stocke, to them that dwell about. Thou makest vs a matter for the heathen to talke of: And a worthy matter wherat all nations maye scoffe. Myne ignominie &amp; reproch, is dayly in my syght: And shame hath couered my face, to thyncke on theyr despyght. I blushe I saye to heare the talke of them that rayle at me: And for my foes and such as would so fayne reuenged be. All these thynges do happen to vs, yet we forget the not: Neyther be we founde vnfaythfull, in thy comnaunt I wot. Our herte returneth not backe warde, we fauour thy wayes styll: Neither do our steppes swarue a syde, from thy pathes and thy wyll. When thou dydste waste vs in the place where the greate dragons were: And couer vs wyth the shadowe of death whych man doeth feare: If we had then forgote the name of our God and our kynge: Declareynge our hertes to a straynge God of mans inuentynge: Thyncke ye God woulde not haue required it in continent? For he knoweth the secretes of the hert and the intent. But for thy sake we are kylled dayly, this is certayne: And are estemed as a flocke appoynted to be slayne. Awake, whye doest thou sheepe (O Lorde) awake (O Lorde) I saye: Do not caste of thy pore seruantes &amp; forsake them for aye. Whye doeste thou hyde thy face from vs and thy bryght countenaunce? Forgettynge our affliction and oure deadly greauaunce? For our lyfe is made very base, no better then the duste: Our bealy cleaneth to the grownde, to lyue we haue no luste. Arise, helpe vs (O Lord I saye) in this our great distresse: Redeme vs for thy greate mercie and for thy greate goodnes. The .xlv. Psalme. Some goodnes doeth myne herte belche out, my meanynge is godly: My worckes and dedes vnto the kynge playnly declare wyll I. My tonge is lyke the penne of one that wryteth most swyftely: And in my talke I speake my wordes verie expeditely. But emonge mortall men thou arte, most eloquent of all: Thou haste a grace in wordes, for God gaue the gyftes eternall. O thou myghtie man gyrde thy sword vp? thy thygh I saye: Thy glorie and magnificence put on and the araye. And in thyne owne magnific?ce ryde thou prosperousely: Upon the worde of trueth, mekenes, &amp; that dealeth truly. And thy right hande and myghtie powre shall the enstructe and teache: To do thynges that are wonderfull, and beyoude all mens reache. Thy shaftes excedynge sharpe shal pearse the herte of such as be: The kinges enmies, and much people shalbe subiect to the. Thy princely seate shall stande for aye, O God stronge and myghtie: The scepter of thy kyngdome is the mase of equitie. Thou loueste ryght and hateste wronge, because God annoynted: The wyth the oyle of gladnes more th? other elected. All thy garmentes do sauour of, Mirre, Aloies, and gynger: Brought out of house of Iuory, to make the myrier. Emonge thy noble women are kynges daughters most demure: And thy wyfe is at thy ryght hande, decked in gould moste pure. Geue eare daughter and marcke me wel, bowe downe thyne eare I saye: Thou doste forget thy people &amp; thy fathers house for aye. For the kyng doeth verie greatly lust after thy beautie: And for because he is thy Lord, honoure thou hym onely. The daughter of Tirus also, shall wyth gyftes sue to the: And in lyke maner shall they that of the richest sorte be. All the kynges daughters glorie is within forth conteyned: Hir garm?tes are of most pure gould, ryght conyngly weaued. In robes embrothered she shal be brought vnto the kynge: Hir handmaydes and companions men shal vnto the brynge. They shall be brought to the I saye, wyth ioye and reioyceynge: And after that they shall come to the palaice of the kynge. And in the stede of thy fathers, chyldren shall the succede: By whome thou shalt appoynt the whole earth to be gouerned. I wyll be myndefull of thy name for euer more I saye: And therfore shall the nations celebrate the for aye. The .xlvi. Psalme. God is our refuge and our str?gth in all our miserie: And a moste present succour in our great aduersitie. Wherfore we wyll not feare thoughe the earth moue out of hir place: And though the hylles emydde the sea, do threate to falle apase. Yea though the waues therof shoulde rage and forowe vp the slyme: And make the greate hylles tremble when they do agaynst them clyme: Yet shal the streames of the ryuer styll refreshe goddes Citie: And the holye place of the tentes, of the Lord God moste hye. God is in the myddle therof, wherfore it shall not fall: He shall helpe it before it do take any harme at all. Let the heath? styr vp tumultes, &amp; kyngdomes make styrrynges: And let the earth breake in sunder, wyth passynge greate criynges: Yet doth the Lorde of hostes styll stande faste by vs at oure nede: Iacobs God is our stronge tower and oure defence in dede. Come hyther and beholde the worckes of the Lorde wyth your eyne: What wonders he hath wrought on earth, thorowe his powre diuine. To the vtmost partes of the earth, all warres he appeaseth: He breaketh bowes, he shreddeth speares, &amp; charettes he burneth. Send backe and acknowledge that I am the Lorde God alone: Moste hygh emonge the nations, on earth lyke me is none. The Lord of hostes is on our syde, he doeth styll take our parte: Iacobs God is our high castell, he wyll not from vs starte. The .xlvij. Psalme. Ye people all, clappe wyth your handes, declare your herte therby: Syng vnto God wyth merie voyce reioyce most hertily. For the Lorde is moste hygh I saye, &amp; eke to be feared: A ryght greate kynge he is by whome al the earth is ruled. He subdueth whole contreys of people vs to obeye: So doeth he ryght greate nations vnder our fete I saye. He hath chosen and pyked out for vs oure heritage: The worthynes of Iacob whome he loued in yonge age. God ascendeth wyth freshe syngynge, and wyth greate melodie: Wyth the blasse and sowne of trumpettes, the Lorde goeth vpon hye. Synge vnto God, synge vnto hym, synge ye vnto our kynge: Synge to our God and kyng I saye, alwaye wythout ceaseynge. For God is kynge of all the earth, and ruleth in the same: Synge vnto him, synge conynglye vnto his holy name. God reygneth ouer nations and the Heathen alone: God sytteth on hys pryncely seate and in hys holy throne. To the people of Habrams God, great rulars are ioyned: Because he doeth excell them that haue the earth defended. The .xlviij. Psalme. The Lorde is greate and much praysed, and magnified styll: Wythin the citie of our God, and in hys holy hyll. The mount Sion on whose north syde the greate kynges towne standeth: Is a goodly c?trey &amp; is the ioye of the whole earth. God is knowne and acknowledged in hys owne palaices: To be a castell of defence, to such men as are his. For lo, kynges came togither and so passed by alonge: And were amased at the syght, and dryuen forth headlonge. This feare and sorowe taketh them euen as vehemently As the throwes of a woman that should trauayle by and by. And as the easterne wynde that doteh blowe wyth greate stormes of hayle: Is wont to breake the shippes that do vpon the salte sea sayle. As we haue hearde so haue we sene, in the Lorde of hostes towne: In oure goddes citie whyche he hath made sure for fallynge downe. O God let vs conceyue in mynd, thy goodnes and mercie: In the myddle of thy temple and thy saynctuarie. Lyke as thy name, so doeth thy prayse (O God) go through the lande: And aboundaunce of iustice is in thy powre and right hande. Let the mount of Sion be glad, let Iudes daughters reioyce: For thy iudgmentes, when they shal heare, thyne holy worde and voyce. Se that ye go aboute Sion, compasse it about rounde: Number all the lettle turrettes, that in hir walles be founde. Marcke hir forefence diligently, and hir palaices hye: That you maye make reporte of it to youre posteritie. For this is God, and our God is for euer &amp; for aye: He shall direct and gouerne vs euen to oure dyeinge daye. The .xlix. Psalme. All people hearken and geue eare to that, that I shall tell: Boeth hygh and lowe boeth riche &amp; pore, that in the worlde do dwell. For whye my mouth shall make discourse, of many thynges ryght wyse: In vnderstandynge shall myne herte hys studie exercise. I wyll enclyne myne eare to knowe thynges full dearckely spoken: And eke vpon myne harpe I wyll make my dearcke speach open. In the tyme of aduersitie, whye should I stande in doubt? If the wyckednes of my steppes should compasse me about. Emonge them that haue greate richesse, and do trust therin moste: And in the multitude therof, do aye glorie &amp; boaste: There is not one that any waye can hys brother redeme: Nor paye to God y? raunsome that, he doeth for hym esteme. For, to redeme theyr soules from death the price would be to hye: To make them so perfect that they myght lyue eternally. And to make them that in them selfe they should no such cause haue: But that they myght lyue euer and neuer come to the graue. For it is playne that as well the wise as the folysh dye: And leaue theyr goodes to other men, but foles die vtterly. Theyr graue shalbe theyr house for aye, &amp; eke theyr dwellynge place: Though lyueynge here they studied vayne glorie for a space. But man doeth neuer longe abyde in estimation: But shalbe lyke a beaste fallynge into destruction. Thys theyr purpose and waye they walke is theyr follye in dede: And yet of theyr posteritie, theyr worddes are alowed. They are placed emonge the deade, as they were flockes of shepe: And death is he that feadeth th?, and hath them for to kepe. And at the iudgment daye the iuste, shall rule them as a kynge: Theyr beawtie shall decaye, &amp; the pyt shalbe theyr dwellynge. But God shall deliuer my soule out of the powre of hell: Because he hath receyued me, in his house for to dwell. When any man is enriched, be not afeard therfore: Or when the glorie of hys house encreaseth more and more. For when he dyeth he shall not, all these thynges wyth him take: His glorie shall not go wyth him, but shal him quite forsake. Because they compt them selues happye, in this vayne lyfe only: When a man is good to him self, then prayse they him greatly. Unto theyr fathers nation, lett all these men go ryght: Let them not haue fruition of confortable lyght. But man doeth not expende and waygh, his owne nobilitie: Wherfore he shalbe lyke the beast that dieth vtterly. The .l. Psalme. God that is Lorde of iudges, spake, and dyd togither cal: As many as do dwelle fr? the sunne rysynge to his falle. The moste noble &amp; famouse God, out of Sion shall shyne: And geue a perfecte presidente of beautie in mens eiene. Our God shall come vnfainedly, wyth fyre before his face: And on eche syde a fierse hurle wynde, his enimies to chase. The heauen aboue and earth byneth, he shall vnto hym call: That wyth iudgm?t he maye c?tend against his people all. Gather to me myne holy ones, that woulde seme so presyse: And that made me a couena?te concernynge sacrifice. Brynge them hyther &amp; the heauens shall theyr iustice declare: And God himselfe shall be theyr iudge whoe knoweth what they are. Geue eare (O ye that wyll be my people) for nowe speake I: O Israel geue eare for nowe I wyll thy matter trye. Geue eare to me I saye for I am God of powre myghtie: I am thy God (O Israell) I tell the certenlye. I wyll not blame the for the lacke of doynge sacrifice: For I se thye brent offeringes daylye before myne eies. I haue no nede to take of the a calfe or a bullocke: Neither the gote that feadeth in thy cote or in thy flocke. For all the wylde beastes of the earth are myne owne good in dede: So are al the beastes that do on a thousand mountaynes fede. I knowe the foules of the mountaynes, I saye I knowe them all: And in my powre are all the beastes, that in the fieldes do cralle. If I should chaunce to be hungry, I nede not to tell the: Syth the rounde worlde is myne wyth al the thynges that therin be. What, do you thyncke that I wyll eate the fleshe of bulles myghtie? Or dryncke the bloude of gotes that ye do shede so plentuousely? Sacrifice thou prayse vnto God, and paye in any wyse: Unto the moste hygh thy vowes and thynges that thou dost promise. When thou arte in aduersitie, then on me se thou crye: And when I shall deliuer the, then set forth my glorie. But God sayeth to the vngodlye, what cometh in thy brayne? That to rehearse my sacramentes, thou doest neuer refrayne. Whye doest thou bragge of my comnante, wyth wordes to none effect? Seynge thou hateste all knoledge, and doest my wordes reiect. If it chaunce the to se a thefe, in him thou haste delyght. And wyth the shamelesse whore hunttars, thy parte is also pyght. Thy mouth thou haste addyct to euel and for to speake amysse: And thy tonge doeth styll frame the thynge, that moste disceytfull is. Thou sytteste in iudgm?t and doest speake agaynst thy brother: And doest reuile moste spitfully, the sonne of thy mother. Thus haste thou done, and wh? I do, let as I dyd not se: Thou doeste I magyne that I am in al poyntes lyke to the. I wyl therfore contende wyth the, and declare thy trespase: And in order I wyl set forth, thy faultes before thy face. I praye you vnderstande this thynge, you that haue forgotte God: Whether ther be any that can preserue you from my rodde. Who so maketh sacrifice of prayse doeth glorifie me: And this is y? way wherby he shall Godes saueynge health see. The .lj. Psalme. Lord God for thy great goodnes sake, be mercifull to me: And for thy passyng great mercie, purge myne iniquitie. From myne iniquitie good Lord, wash thou me plentuously: And fr? my synnes and trespases do thou me mundifie. For myne offences I confesse, and do none of them hyde: My synnes Lorde &amp; my wyckednes do in my syght abyde, I haue offended the alone, &amp; sinned in thy syght: wherfore thy wordes shalbe founde true, &amp; thy iudgmentes vpright. Behold Lord in iniquitie, was I made &amp; formed:: And was not fre from wyckednes, when I was conceiued. For lo, Lorde thou louest the truth, euen from the verie herte: And hast shewed me of thy wysedome, euen the secrete parte. Purge me wyth I sope &amp; I shall, be pure and cleane I knowe: Washe thou me, &amp; then shall I be more whyt then is the snowe. Brynge thou to passe that I maye heare great ioye and reioyceynge: And that they whome thou haste brought lowe, may thy great prayses synge. Turne thy face from my wickednes &amp; loke not on my synne: To blot out myne iniquities, Lorde God do thou begynne. Create, Lorde God wythin my breste, an vndefiled herte: And in my bowelles Lorde renewe, a spirite that wyll not starte. Caste thou me not out of thy syght, ne do thou me forget: Neyther do thou thyne holy spirite, from thy pore seruant fet. Restore to me the reioyceynge, Lorde of thy saueynge helth: And with thy principall sprite Lord, stablishe thy seruantes welthe. To the transgressers of thy lawes, thy wayes I wyll declare: And to the shalbe conuerted, men that great synnes are. O God, the God of my soule helth, deliuer me from bloud: And my tonge shall wyth ioye declare, the boeth ryghtwise and good. Open thou my lyppes good Lorde, &amp; teach my tonge to speake: And then my mouth wythout ceasyng, shall in thy prayse out breake. For if sacrifice dyd please the, I would geue the such thynges: But thou delitest not good Lord, in the brent offerynges. A pensiefe and a troubled spirite, is to God sacrifice: A broken and a contrite hert, God thou wylt not despyse. Lorde God, of thy bountuousnes, do thou fauour Sion: That the walles of Ierusalem, may be buylded anon. Then shall please the brent offerynges, &amp; sacrifice of right: And on thyne holy aultare Lorde, men shall fatte bullockes dyght. The .lij. Psalme. Thou tyrant why reioycest thou, in that thou doest amysse: Sence the goodnes of God oure Lorde dayly amonge vs is. Wayes to corrupt &amp; to destroye, thy tonge doeth styll inuent: Euen as it were a sharp rasour, that to cut is styll bent. Thou dost delyght rather to hurt, &amp; thyne anger to wreake: Then do to well, &amp; for to lye then ryght and trueth to speake. All wordes that brynge destruction, &amp; do therto belonge: Thou loueste for to spreade abroade wyth a disceytfull tonge. Wherfore God shall scatter thy stocke, &amp; take it cleane awaye: He shal cut the out of thy tent, and make thy rote decaye. Whych thynge when the rightwise shall se, then shall they stand in awe: And shall laugh and make reioyceynge, at the syght that they sawe. They shall saye, lo, this is the man, that in God hath not trust: But in the heape of hys riches, and in hys wicked lust. But I lyke a grene olyue tree in the Lordes house I saye: Haue put my trust in hys goodnes, for euer and a day. Because thou haste me made good Lorde, thy preases wyll I tell: And wyl trust in thy name because thy sanctes do lyke it well. The .liij. Psalme. The folysh &amp; insipi?t, whose thoughtes are euer vayne: Do in theyr herte saye folyshlye, theris no God certayne. Corrupt they are in all theyr wayes, made abominable: To fynde one good amonge them all, ther is no man able. Upon the sonnes of mortal men, God loked downe from heauen: To se if ther were any wyse, or for to seeke God geuen. They haue gone astraye togither, and are corrupt ech one: That hath done the thynge that is good, there can not be founde one. Howe can they haue knowledge (saith God) that worcke iniquitie: And lyke breade eate vp my people, &amp; do not on me crye? There feared they excedynglye, where feare in dede was none: Because God doeth all them destroye, that besiege the, Sion. Because God is theyr enmie thou haste made them ashamed: Woulde God that out of the (Sion) Iacob myght be saued. That God myght once make an ende of, his peoples seruitude: That wyth great ioye &amp; reioycynge, Iacob myght be endude. The .liiij. Psalme. For thy names sake helpe me (O God) in thy strength deliuer: Thy seruant (O God) heare my prayer, do my wordes consyder. For strayngars and straynge nations agaynst me do arise: And tyrantes that seke my soule haue no God before theyr eyes. Behold (I saye) it is the Lord, that doeth myne enimies let: And he is styll present wyth them, that do me vnderset. Myne aduersaries and my foes, he shall wyth iuell rewarde: And shall them all destroye because, he doeth his trueth regarde. I shall make to the sacrifice, wyth fre and wyllyng mode: And wyll set forth thy name wyth prayse, because thou art so good. For out of all afliction, thou haste deliuered me: And my desyre vp? my foes, Lord God, myne eies do see. The .lv. Psalme. Geue eare to my praier (O God) and do not thy selfe hyde: From the humble petition, that I make at this tyde. Geue eare I saye to me (O God) &amp; answere me againe: For in my praier I make mone and greuously complayne. And that through the outragiouse crie of enimies in dede: And through the great vexati?, of men that are wicked. Which wicked men do against me practise theyr wickednes: And in theyr passynge great anger, put me to great distresse. Pensife &amp; heauie is myne herte (Lord God) wythin my breste: And the horrors and feares of death, haue me greatly oppreste. Excedynge great feare &amp; tremblyng haue lighted on my lot: And most horrible dread also, hath quelled me I wot. Wherfore I saye, would God I had, wynges lyke vnto a doue: For then would I flye hence where none of these thynges should me moue. Lo then would I get me far hence, and dwell in wildernes: And would make haste for to escape this tempest of distresse. Destroy them Lorde and slit theyr tonges take on them no pitie: For I haue sene vnrightuousnes &amp; strife in the citie. These thynges compasse the walles ther of, boeth by daye and by nyght: And in the myddes therof greuaunce, and wyckednes are pight. In it I saye is wyckednes, euen in the inner parte: At no tyme do gyle and deceyte, out of hir stretes departe. Of a man that had hated me, or that myne enmie were: The proude checkes and the reuilynges, I could suffer and beare. But sence thou art my capitayne, my felowe and my frend: Thy reuylynges and threatenynge, do my mynd sore offende. For we haue had swete and secrete, communication: In the house of the Lord our God, and haue togither gone. Lorde, let death strike them sodenlye, let them be buried, quicke: For in theyr secrete houses, Lorde great wickednes doeth sticke. As for me, I wyll crie to God, and will his mercie craue: And then the Lord I am right sure, wyll his pore seruant saue. At euenynge, at morne and none tyde, I wyll mourne and complayne: And then to heare his seruantes voyce, the Lorde wyll not disdayne. It is he that delyuereth, his seruauntes soule in peace: From all that lye in wayte for it, who are many doubles. That God I saye that lyueth aye, shall heare his seruauntes prayer: And shall plage them of whose mendment, men maye iustly dispayer. They feare not God, but laye handes on, such as cleaue vnto hym: And so they breake hys couenaunt, and do it not esteme. Theyr mouthes are softer then butter, yet are warres in theyr mynde: Their wordes are muche more smoth then oyle, yet swerdes ye shall them fynde. O caste thy burden on the Lorde, and he shall the sustayne: For he wyll not suffer the iuste, in troubles to remayne. In the meane tyme (O God) thou shalt thrust headlynge in to hell: The bloud thyrsty and disceyuers, that are fiers and cruell. They shall not lyue out halfe theyr tyme, nor halfe theyr lyfe dayes see: But as for me (good Lorde) I wyll styll put my trust in the. The .lvj. Psalme. Be mercifull to me (O God) for men wyll treade me downe: They fyght agaynste, and trouble me dayly in fielde and towne. Vnder theyr feete myne enimies, do treade me downe dayly: For they that proudly fyght agaynst, thy seruaunt are many. Neuerthelesse, at euerie tyde, when feare inuadeth me: Then do I put my confid?ce and trust onely in the. In God I wyll set forth his worde, and in hym put my trust: And as for men I do not passe, let them do what they luste. They are offended at my wordes, and do them dayly carpe: All theyr studye is to hurt me, on this one strynge they harpe. They cluster &amp; renne togither, they spye on euerie syde: They watch my steppes because my death, of them is desyred. They haue a trust for to escape, but that is all in vayne: For God wyll not in his anger whole nati?s, retrayne. My rennynges from myne enimies, in persecution: Thou haste by numbre in thy boke, and eke my teares eche one. So ofte as I call on thy name, myne enimies do flye: Wherby that thou arte God my Lorde, I do knowe certenlye. Whatso euer God sendeth me, I wyl take in good parte: And in the worde of God my Lorde, I shall conforte myne herte. In God my Lorde my confidence, &amp; onlye trust shalbe: I wyll not stande in dreade nor feare what man can do to me. To the wyll I paye al my vowes (O God) and wyll be hyght: And paye to the boeth laude and prayse with all my mayne and myght. For thou sauest my soule from death, and my feete from fallynge: That I maye walke before the in the lyght of the lyueynge. The .lvij. Psalme. Be mercifull to me (O God) be mercifull to me: For the soule of thy pore seruant putteth hir trust in the. Under the shadowe of thy wynges, my hope is pytched faste: Where myne onlye refuge shalbe, tyll wyckednes be paste. I shal call &amp; crie vnto God, that is highest of all: To God I saye that doeth helpe me vp agayne when I fall. The same shall send from heauen down &amp; shall deliuer me: From the reprofe of him that would my confusion see. He shall, I saye, send vnto me euen for his mercies sake: And for the faythfull promise that, it pleased hym to make. My soule is set in the myddes of the lions full of Ire: And I my selfe am layed amonge men that do flame wyth fyre. Theyr teeth are sharpe and persynge speres, and sharpe arowes I wene: Theyr tonges are swerdes wel made to cute and are excedyng kene. Set vp thy selfe (O God) aboue the heauens that are so hye: And aboue all the earth exalte thy prayse &amp; thy glorie. A net they haue layed for my fete, and put my soule to blame: They haue dygged a pyt for me, &amp; are fallen in the same. To synge and geue the prayse (O God) myne hert is euer prest: To set forth thy greate prayse, I saye, my mynd is redye dreste. Awake my tonge and strength to speake, for thou arte my glorie: Awake my lute and eke my harpe, for I wyll rise erlye. Amonge the people wyll I geue thankes vnto the O Lord: And amonge the heathen my tonge shall thy prayses recorde. For the greatnes of thy mercie reacheth vp to the skye: And thy faythfulnes &amp; thy trueth, toucheth the starres so hye. Set vp thy selfe (O God) aboue, the heauens that are so hye: And aboue al the earth exalte, thy prayse &amp; thy glorie. The .lviij. Psalme. O ye the sonnes of mortall men, ye goddes and men of myght: Do ye geue rightuouse sentences, and iudge mens matters right? Nay, but rather you Imagyne mischiefe wythin your brest: And by your violence men are sore laden and oppreste. So sone as these vngodly men were borne they went astraye: And fr? theyr mothers wombe they learned vntrueth for to saye. Theyr poysens are lyke the poysens that in fell serpentes are: They are lyke the deafe Adder that doth vse to stop hir eare. For the adder doeth stop hir eare lest she should heare haply: The voyce of the charmar that doeth by charmes worcke skylfully. Of these mens mouthes breake thou the teeth (O God) and smyte in twayne: The chafte bones of the lyons whelppes who are cruell certayne. That they may fall awaye lyke the water that faste doeth ren: And that when they shote theyr arrowes, the same may be broken. Let them consume as doth a snayle, that turneth into slyme: And as the fruite that a woman, beareth before hir tyme. Yeare that your sharpe and prickynge thornes, shall be redie to pricke: Gooddes wrath lyke to a stormye wynde, shall take you awaye quicke. When the rightwise shall se these thynges they shall reioyse greatly: And they shal wash theyr feete in the bloude of the vngodly. Then shall men saye the rightuouse are certayne to haue rewarde: For the Lorde God iudgeth the earth who doeth iustice regarde. The .lix. Psalme. My God, delyuer me from th? that be myne enimies: And defend me from them that do agaynst thy seruant rise. Delyuer me (O God) from them that do worcke wyckedly: And saue thy pore seruant from such men as are bloude thriftie. For lo they laye wayte for my soule, and conspyre agaynste me: Not for any offence or fault (Lord) that in me they see. Not prouoked by me, they do hastly them selfes prepare: Wherfore arise thou and helpe me, and loke vpon my care. O Lord of hostes, O Iacobs God, awake, visite the heathen: Shewe thou no mercie, to them that to wickednes are geuen. Let them returne emptie at nyght, and let them hole lyke houndes: And make them wander rounde about, the cities and the townes. Beholde they speake agaynste me wyth their mouthes, and swerdes are hyd: Under theyr lyppes, for they are not for such thynges reproued. But thou (O Lorde) shalt euer haue them in derision: The heathen (Lorde) thou shalt deride, and laugh them all to skorne. I do ascribe to the (O God) all my str?gth and my power: For thou art my falfegard (good Lorde) and only defender. Thy goodnes to thy pore seruant thou shewest plentuousely: And lettest me se my desyer vpon myne enimie. Lorde destroy not them sodenlye, leste my people forget: But as thou art oure defender, do them in sunder sette. For theyr proude and statly wordes Lorde take thou them in theyr pride: And for theyr periurie and lyes, suffer them not to byde. Consume them Lord in thy furie, consume them cleane awaye: That they may knowe that God ruleth in all the earth this daye. Let them returne emptie at nyght, &amp; let them howle lyke houndes: And make them wander rounde about the cities and the townes. Let them wander about I saye, and seke whereon to feede: And let them not fynd sustinaunce, to satisfie theyr nede. Wyth reioyceynge I shall declare thy myght and greate goodnes: Because thou arte my tower of strength, &amp; refuge in distres. To the I saye (O God my strength) wyll I reioyce and synge: Because thou arte my whole defence, and most mercifull kynge. The .lx. Psalme. O God thou dydest vs forsake, reiect, &amp; waste moued: But nowe thou arte pleased agayn and hast vs receyued. Thou dashedest the earth together, and brakest it in twayne: But nowe repare the brackes therof, for it shaketh certayne. Hard chaunce and misse fortune thou hast layed on thy peoples lot: And haste geuen vs such wyne to dryncke, as is deadly I wot. Yet haste thou geuen a sygne to them that do walke in thy feare: That they should triumph in thy trueth, &amp; in no wise dispeare. Let thy power saue thy beloued that they do not dispeare. Shewe forth thy powre I saye good Lord, &amp; heare thy seruantes prayer. Because God hath spoken the worde wyth in hys holy place: I shal wyth ioye diuide Sichem and Sochothes vale by pase. Galaad and eke Manasses are myne, but Ephraim: Is the key of my kyngdome, and Iuda my lawes doeth deme. In Moab wyll I laye my fylth, and ouer Edom skyppe: And thou palastine sue to me for fauour and frendshyppe. Who shall leade me into that forte, that myghtie stronge citie? Who shal conducte me to Edom and my salfe conduct be? Shalt not thou do it (O my God) who didest vs forsake: And wouldest not walke wyth our men wh? we dyd the wars take? O God, helpe thou in al distresse, for mans helpe is but vayne: But we shall fyght stoutly through God, by whom our foes are slayne. The .lxj. Psalme. Oh God heare thy pore seruantes crye, and hearcken to my prayer: And let not my voyce and my crye in vayne trouble the ayer. From the vtmost partes of the earth I shall crye vnto the: In the distres of mynde when myn herte amased shalbe. Then shall I saye, Oh Lorde set me vpon thy rocke so hye: For thou arte my refuge &amp; strength agaynste myne enimie. In thy tente wyll I dwell for aye that I maye dwell salfly: Vnder the shadowe of thy wynges is my desyre holye. For thou (O God) hast heard my vowes &amp; pondered my desyres: And such men as do feare thy name, Lorde thou hast made thyne heyers. To the kynge do thou geue long lyfe, that hys yeres maye enduer: Through many generations, to thy wyll &amp; pleasure. Let the kyng syt before the (Lord) for euer and a daye: And let thy mercie and thy trueth preserue the same alwaye. Then shall I neuer sease to synge, vnto thy holy name: That I maye performe all my vowes dayly vnto the same. The .lxij. Psalme. Only on God my soule loketh &amp; hath to hym respect: For in hym and in none other, myne health taketh effect. For he onelye is my sure grownde, my salfgard and defence: So that my fall can not be greate through fleshly violence. How longe wil you studie disceyte agaynst all maner men? Ye shal al perishe as the walle, or hedge that is broken. Lord, these men woulde blot out my lyfe, they play the lyars parte: Wyth the mouth they do praye for me, but cursse me wyth theyr herte. Neuerthelesse (O thou my soule) do thou to God enclyne: For fr? him only doeth thy truste and thyne onely hope shyne. For he only is my sure grounde, &amp; my saluation: I shall not fall, he is my strength, and my tuition. Myne health lyeth in God alone, my glorie and my myght: And in the Lord my confidence, &amp; only trust is pyght. O put your trust in him alwaye, ye people of the land: Pour out your hertes before the Lord, in whome our hope doeth stande. As for men they are all but vayne, and delyted to lye: And are as lyght in a balance as is vayne vanitie. Put no truste in mysse gotten goodes, ne serue you vanitie: And when you do flowe in richesse, set not to much therby. God hath spoken this one thyng twyse, wherfore it is certayne: And I my selfe haue heard him saye, that in him strength doeth raygne. He sayde also that in the Lord, is goodnes and mercie: And that he doeth reward eche man, after as his worckes be. The .lxiij. Psalme. O God thou arte my myghtie God, my salfe gard &amp; defence: Wherfore I wyl seke the ech daye wyth carfull diligence. My soule thyrsteth for the (O Lord) &amp; my fleshe hath a luste: To taste of the in this drye lande, where for water is duste. Thus do I that I maye behold the in thy holy place: That I maye se thy mightie power &amp; glorie of thy face. For lyfe it selfe is not so swete, as thy loueyng kyndnes: Wherfore to shewe thy worthy prayse, my lyppes shall neuer sease. And so shall I duryng my lyfe, alwaye magnifie the: And in thy name lyfte vp myne handes, as it becommeth me. Then shall my soule be satisfied, as wyth most swete fatnes And therfore shall my lyppes reioyce, and my mouth shewe thy prayse. O Lord, when I lye in my bed, I shall remembre the: And wh? I wake out of my slepe, on the my thought shall be. For thou only art he from whom, all myne helpe doeth procede: And in the shadowe of whose wynges, my soule is delited. O Lorde, my soule cleaueth to the, thy right hand is my staye: Let th? that would destroye my soule, syncke downe to hell for aye. Make them of force to fall vpon the edge of the sharpeswerde: And of the rauenyng woulfes Lorde, let th? be deuoured. But the kynge shall reioyce in God, &amp; eche man be praysed: That swereth by his holy name, and lyars mouthes stopped. The .lxiiij. Psalme. In my complaynt Lorde heare my voyce, &amp; hearken to my crie: And preserue my lyfe fr? the feare, of the fierce enimie. Lorde, hyde me from the counsell of men that are vngodly: And fr? the vprores of such men, as do worcke wyckedly. For these men do sharpen theyr tonges, euen as they were sharpe swordes: And as wyth a bowe that is bent, they shote forth bytter wordes. That they may hurte men priuily whose lyfe is innocent: And stryke and wounde them sodenly, not feareynge to be shent. They make themselfe stronge in mischiefe and studie snares to hyde: And then they saye thus wyth themselues, howe can these thynges be spyed. They do imagyne wyckenes, &amp; kepe it in couerte: Eche man hydeth hys mischiefe in the bott? of hys herte. But God shall stryke them sodenly, euen wyth a sharpe arrowe: Wherby they shall be sore wounded, &amp; pearsed quite thorowe. Yea theyr owne tonges shall make them fall, and be as men forlorne: Then shall as many asse them laugh and dryue them to scorne. All men shall se this thynge I saye, &amp; shall boldly confesse: That goddes owne hande hath done this dede, to punishe wyckednes. But the iuste shall reioyse &amp; trust, in God the Lord only: And all that be of vpright hert, shall ioye excedyngly. The .lxv. Psalme. O God, thou only art worthy to haue prayse in Sion: And that all y? people do paye, theyr vowes to the alone. For thou hearest y? prayers of thy people in theyr nede: Wherfore all men resorte to the, wyth full trust for to spede. The reckenynge of our wyckednes, was more then we coulde paye: But thou Lorde for thy great mercy haste put our synnes awaye. The man that is chosen of the, is happy &amp; right sure: That in thy courte and temple he, shal dwell in greate pleasure. O God oure health, O the refuge, of all coastes of the land: And of them that do dwel far of, in the seas &amp; sea sand. O thou I saye, that by thy power, haste set the hyll so sure: And art euer gyrded about, wyth strenght that wyll endure. O thou that doest quiete the seas, and the rude peoples rage: In thy iustice thou hast sharplye threatned thyne heritage. So that all they that dwell far of, shall feare when they shall se: Thy tokens, for thou makeste boeth euen &amp; morne to prayse the. Thou haste caused the earth to chappe for lacke of hir due rayne: And haste wyth plentie of water, shotte vp hir chappes agayne. O God thy riuer is brymme full, wherby thou doest prepare: All maner grayne for man, whych thou causest the earth to beare. Thou doeste water hir forowes &amp; causete hir cloddes to fall: Thou supplest hir wyth water dropes, and geuest encrease wyth all. Thou doest crowne and set forth the yere of thy passyng goodnes: And to poure downe dropes of plentie, thy cloudes do neuer sease. The pastures of the desert are fayre and full of plentie: And the litle hylles are beset wyth all fertylytie. The fieldes and valleys of the earth haue for theyr couerynge: Such flockes of shipe and plottes of grayne, that they reioyce and synge. The .lxvj. Psalme. All earthly men reioyce to God, and prayse hys holy name: Set forth hys praise I saye &amp; geue glorie vnto the same. Saye vnto God, Oh in thy worckes howe wonderfull art thou? For the pl?tie of thy power doeth cause thyne enmies to bowe. All they that dwell vpon the earth, shall honour the, O Lorde: And shall all synge to the and to thy name wyth one accord. Oh come hither and se the worckes of God and tell me then. Howe farre his co?selles do excede the wytte of mortall men. The sea he turned to drye lande and gaue passage therby: Wherfore our fathers dyd reioyce in him excedyngly. By his power he hath aye ruled the world and doeth beholde: All contreys wyth his eie so that no rebelles dare be bolde. O ye people, preach ye our God, and make his name be knowne: By you let the voyce of his prayse, throughout the earth be blowne. For this is he that doeth preserue our soules euer on lyue: And suffereth not our fete to slyp when we wyth Satan stryue. O God, though thou do proue &amp; trye vs a syluer is tryed: And doeste leade vs into prison and make vs ther be tyed: Though thou, I saye, doest suffer men ouer our heades to ryde: And that most fiers and sharppe tormentes we do suffer and byde. Yet doest thou bryng vs out agayne into a place of reste: And doest not suffer thy serua?tes for aye to be oppreste. I wyl therfore into thy house, Lorde God wyth sacrifice: And wyll not leaue my vowes vnpayed to the in any wise. For when I was in trouble Lorde, then wyth my mouth I spake: And in the doloures of myne herte all these vowes dyd I make. Brunt offeringes that are ryght fat I wyll offer to the: Of the swete smoke of rammes, bullockes, &amp; gotes the same shall be. Come hither and geue eare al ye in whom goddes feare doeth dwell: For of the thynges that he hath done to my soule, I shall tell. Wyth my mouth I dyd crye to him &amp; call on him alone: Wherin my tonge declared that lyke him ther is founde none. If in myne hert I would haue had respect to wyckednes: No doubt the Lord would not haue heard me in my great distres. But nowe God hath geuen eare to me &amp; heard hys seruantes praier: And hath graunted my whole request euen as I dyd desyre. God is to be praysed therfore, which neyther dyd put backe: My prayer neither suffer me hys mercie for for to lacke. The .lxvij. Psalme. Be mercifull to vs (O God) &amp; blesse vs at thy wyll: And lyght? thy bright counten?ce amonge thy seruauntes styll. That through the earth thyne holy waye maye be certenly knowe: And thyne health through out all contreys for all they are thyne owne. Let the people prayse the (O God) let all people prayse the: And let th? al reioyce because they be iudged by the. Let them reioyce in the I saye, &amp; be mery and glad: Because all nations of the earth by thy iustice are ladde. Let the people prayse the (O God) let all people prayse the: And let the earth bryng forth hir fruite, as thy pleasure shall be. Blesse vs (O God) I saye our god, blesse vs in verite: That all that dwell vpon the earth maye stand in awe of the. The .lxviij. Psalme. The vpriseyng of God putteth his enimies to flyght: And causeth al them that hate him to flye out of his syght. For as smoke vanisheth awaye and wax is molt wyth fyre: So doeth the wycked perish from goddes syght in his great Ire. As for the iuste, they do reioyce before God And are glad: They are delyghted inwardly, &amp; can neuer be sad. Synge vnto God, synge to his name, &amp; make a perfect waye: To him that rideth in hygh heauen, whose name is Lorde for aye. Reioyce before him for he is father to fatherlesse: And in his holy house he doeth, the wydowes cause redresse. He is the God that maketh peace, and breaketh prisoners band: And causeth traytours for to dwell, in an vnfruitfull land. When he went out through wyldernes before his peoples face: The earth shoke &amp; the heauens molt before him in his place. God of his goodnes sent downe rayne vpon his heritaunce. And fylled all the barrant plottes therof wyth aboundaunce. That his people myght dwel therin, thus dyd the Lorde prepare: For his pore flocke and gaue his worde to such as for them care. The kynges that had great armies fled, they fled and toke the foyle: And such men as sate styll at home, haue diuided the spoyle. What though no doues fether haue bene more vyle then they in syght? Yet shall they be as preciouse nowe, as gould that shyneth bryght. When the almightie had scattred, the kynges that ther dyd raygne: Th? dyd it glist? lyke the snowe, on zalmon that mountayne. Goddes hil Sion, is lyke Basan for w?derfull plentie: An hyll it is that aboundeth wyth all fertilitie. O ye great hylles, ye myghtie kynges, whye do ye hate this hyll: Syth it pleaseth the Lorde and he wyll dwel therupon styll? His horsmen are twentie thousand, and his angelles many In whom he is as in Sinai, in hys sanctuarie. He is gone vp on hygh and hath wyth him men that where thrall He hath receyued gyftes for men, yea for his foes and all. Thus hath he done that he myght be the Lord praysed for aye: For as the God of our health he geueth vs gyftes eche daye. Our God (I say) and sauiour he is whilse we haue breath: And by him alone we escape, the sharppe passage of deathe. Yet doeth he wound the heades of them that are his enimies: And the crowne of the heade of them that from synne wyll not ryse. Thus sayde the Lord, I wyll restore my people home agayne: From Basan and from the depe sea, they shal not there remayne. Therfore I saye (O my people) thou shalt not fayle to treade: In thy foes bloud and thy dogges tonges shallbe therwyth made redde. The maner of the goynge of my God, my Lord and kynge: Is well sene in his holy place, where he is abydyng. The syngyng m? do go before, then folowe the mynstrelles: And laste of all the fayer maydens playinge vpon tymbrelles. O ye that descend of the flocke of mightie Israell: Prayse ye the Lorde in such order as ye haue hearde me tell. Fyrst lyttle Beniamin ruleth, and Iuda is your strength: Then Sebulon and Neptali, are captaynes good at length. It is god that hath geu? you this strength you maye be sure: O God confirme the same in vs that it may styll endure. For the kynges do offer to the mo gyftes in sacrifice: Then be made at Ierusalem after the temples guise. Rebuke the myghtie men of armes, that in armes can do well: And the stronge men of euerie land, that for lucre rebell. Disparse them that delyght in warres &amp; let messengers come: Out of Egypt and Ethiope, and sue to thy kyngdome. Synge to the Lord (O ye kyngdomes of the earth) and reioyse: To him that rideth on the heauens, &amp; stretcheth out his voyce. Ascribe to hym all myght and power, for his glorie doeth raygne: Ouer Israell &amp; his powre, aboue the cloudes certayne. O God thou arte to be feared, in thy sanctuarie: For thou geuest powre to thy flocke, and arte of prayse worthy. The .lxix. Psalme. Helpe me (O God) for I am lyke to perishe out of hand: For I do syncke into the myer, where is no place to stande. Into depe waters I am fallen, which do me ouer flowe: I am werie wyth lowde criynge, my throte wareth drye nowe. Wyth ofte lokynge vp to my God, myne eies begyne to fayle: And they that hate me wythout cause, are now lyke to preuayle. For they are moe in numbre then the heyres are on myne head: Wherby they cause me to paye that I neuer receiued. What ignoraunce hath caused me, to do Lord thou doeste see: My synnes Lorde and my wyckednes, are not vnknowne to the. O God of hostes, let not them that to the wyth fayth repare: Haue cause by that they see in me, to fall into dispeare. For in thy cause do I suffer, all this rebuke and shame: And am caste out from my kynred, &amp; made straynge to the same. The thought that I take for thy house, is greate breakynge to me: And I take all such wordes to herte, as men speake agaynst the. If I dyd euer faste or wepe, my bodye for to tame: The same hathe ben caste in my teeth, as a thynge worthy blame. I lapte my bodie in sack cloth, and ware it for a coate: And then began they sor to skoffe and ieste at me I wotte. Yea they that sate in the towne gates the rulars and the kynges: Iested at me, and the drunckardes made th? songes of these thynges. But I make my prayer to the (O Lorde) that I ne mysse: Of helpe through thy goodnes and trueth, when thy good pleasure is. Pulle me out of the depe myer, and from drownynge me kepe: Deliuer me from enimies &amp; from the waters depe. Leste the surges do ouerflowe, and the syncke swalowe me: And the depe pytte shutte vp his mouth, wh? I shall therin be. O Lorde graunt my requeste to me, euen for thy goodnes sake: And as thy mercies are man y, oon me pitie take. Hyde not thy face from thy seruant, for I am nowe troubled: Make haste (O God) &amp; shortly let my request be graunted. O Lorde drawe nygh vnto my soule, let it be salfe through the: And because of myne enimies, Lord God deliuer me. Thou knowest what rebuke I do byde, what shame and dishonour: For all they that do trouble me, are in thy syght ech houre. Through the rebuke myne herte is broke and heauie is my mynde: I loke for some to pitie me, but no conforte I fynde. They dyd geue me gall in my meate, and when I was thyrsty: They gaue me vinager to dryncke, such was theyr crueltie. Let theyr table be made a snare, to take themselfes wyth all: And where they trust to lyue in peace, ther let them take a fall. Darken the eies of theyr iudgment, lest they would loke and see: Make theyr loynes weake and breake theyr backes, that thus haue done to me. Poure out thy wrath on them &amp; let thyne hotte anger them quell: Let theyr houses be made deserte, and none therin to dwell. For when thou hast striken a man, they persecute hym styll: And suche men as thou haste wounded, they endeuour to kyll. Let them encrease in wyckednes, &amp; neuer se iustice: Wype them out of the boke lyfe, from em?ge the rightwise. As for me, syth I am afflict and sorowfull of mynd: His salfgard in thyne health (O God) let thy pore seruant fynd. Then shall I prayse goddes; holy name, wyth most ioyfull syngynge: and shall magnifie the same with most hertie thanckes geuynge. This thynge is more accepted, wyth the Lorde and doeth hym moue: Much more then to offer a calfe that hath boeth horne and houe. O yet that lyue in miserie, se thys thynge and be glad: For ye that seke God ernestly, shal not in hert be sad. For the Lorde heareth the nedie, in most mercifull wyse: Hys bondmen and hys prisoners, he doeth neuer despise. The heauens, the earth, and eke the seas, and all that therin crepe: Shall prayse the Lord in his doynges, and of his wordes take kepe. For the Lord shall preserue Sion, &amp; Iudes cities restore: That men may dwell ther, and possesse that land for euer more. The neuiews of his seruauntes shall enherite it I saye: And all that loue his holy name shall dwell therin for aye. The .lxx. Psalme. O God make haste to deliuer, thy seruant at hys nede: And let me haue thyne helpe good Lorde, wyth al haste &amp; quicke spede. Let them suffer shame and rebuke, that beare my soule such spyght: And let them be put backe wyth shame that in myne hurtes delyght. Let them be dryuen backe (I saye) because they seke my shame: And do behold my myseries, and reioyse in the same. But let th? reioyse &amp; be glad, that ernestly seke the: And let them that loue thyne health saye, let goddes prayse in vs be. Make haste to me (O God) for I am pore in myserie: Myne helpar and my pledge thou arte, O Lorde do not tarie. The .lxxj. Psalme. In the (O Lorde) haue I trusted, &amp; thought my selfe certayne: Wherfore let me neuer haue cause to saye this truste was vayne. But for thy iustice sake rydde me, and do me deliuer: Bowe downe thyne eare to me, O Lord, and be my defender. Be thou my fort whyther to flye, I may alwayes be bolde: Thou intendest to saue me Lord, for thou art my stronge holde. Pulle me out of the power of them that are wyckedly bent: And out of the grypynge of the peruers and violent. For thou arte he on whom only I do trust and depend: Lorde God my truste hath euer bene, that thou shouldest me defend. Sence the tyme that thou drewest me out of my mothers wome: I haue trusted on the, fr? whom al my glorie doeth come. Many take me for a monster, but thou arte my defence: And my mouth shall not lacke thy praise, nor thy magnificence. In the tyme of myne olde age, when my weake membres shall shake: then caste me not out of thy syght, ne do thou me forsake. For they that be myne enimies, haue had much talke of me: And they that laye wayte for my soule, often in counsell be. Persecute and laye handes on him (saye they) you shall him take: Ther shall no man delyuer him, for God doeth him forsake. O God, my God, be not far of from me when I shall nede: And for to helpe thy pore seruant, Lord God make thou good spede. Let them perishe wyth shame inough, that do my lyfe enuie: And let them be hyd wyth rebuke, that do myne hurt studie. As for me I shall paciently, abyd thy good pleasure: And shall encrease thy prayses styll, wyle my lyfe shall enduer. Thy iustice and thy saueyng healthe my mouth shall dayly shewe: The ende wherof or iuste numbre neuer yet could I knowe. I wyll therfore begyne to speake, only of thy greate might: And only thy iustice shall be present wyth me in syght. From my youth to this present tyme thou haste me enstructed: Wherfore thy wonderfull worckes shall by me be declared. Forsake me not tyll I be olde, and haue preached thy power: To them that be, and thy strength to them that shall come after. O God that haste wrought so greate thynges, who can be lyke to the? I shall extoll thy iustice Lorde, as it becommeth me. Many and greate are the troubles, that through the on me fell: But thou shalt restore me to lyfe, &amp; brynge me out of hell. Thou shalt augment myne honour and encrease my dignitie: And after all my troubles I shal haue c?fort of the. Wherfore (my God) vpon my lute I wyll synge and prayse the: And all my songes vpon myne harpe, shall prayse thy veritie. O holy one of Israel, when I shall to the synge: My lyppes and soule that thou hast bought, shall flowe wyth reioyseynge. Yea and my tonge shall daylye speake (Lord) of thy rightuousnes: When rebuke and shame shall lyght on th? that dome oppresse. The .lxxij. Psalme. O God geue to the kynge knowledge to iudge matters aright: And in y? hert of the kynges sonne, let thy iustice be pyght. That he may gouerne the people accordynge to iustice: And defend the cause of the pore, in iudgm?t and assice. Let the mountaynes &amp; myghtie kynges geue all theyr people peace: And let the lyttle hylles be iuste, to all men more and lesse. Let them reuenge the oppressed, &amp; kepe the pore from wronge: And punishe the wronge doars that are for the pore to stronge. Let them feare the so longe as the sunne and the mone shall shyne: And let thy feare alwayes abyde before the rulars eiene. Let the kynge be to the people, lyke rayne to a medowe: And as the dropes of rayne are to, the earth that men do plowe. Let the iust florish in his tyme, much peace be therin found: Tyl such tyme as the mone shal cease to kepe hir compasse rownde. Let him beare rule from sea to sea, and fr? the water syd: Euen to the vttermost lymettes, of all the earth so wyde. Let them that dwell in wyldernes, fall downe before his face: And let his foes and enimies, lycke the duste of the place. Let the kynges that rule the Ilandes that are in the mydse as: And kynges of Arabie and Saba, brynge him gyftes of prease. Let all kynges &amp; all nations, him honour and obeie: For he shall heare the pore mans crie, when all helpe is awaye. He shall be mercifull to them, that be pore and nedie: And shall preserue the lyues of th? that lyue in pouertie. From disceyte and from iniurie, he shall theyr lyues redeme: And in hys syght theyr bloud he shall, as preciouse esteme. The pore shall lyue and shall geue goulde of Saba to the kynge: They shall alwaye praye for hym and dayly geue hym blessynge. The hygh mountaynes of hys lande shall beare corne in such plentie: That they shall loke lyke Libanus to men in the citie. His name shall continue for aye, and in it shall reioyce: All nations, &amp; the Heathen shall prayse hym wyth one voyce. Let the Lorde our God be blessed, the God of Israell: For he alone worcketh wonders in heauen earth and in hell. Blessed be the holy name of hys glorie for aie: Let his maiestie fyll the earth, amen, amen I saye. The .lxxiij. Psalme. Howe good is God to such as be, of hert perfect and pure: Yet were my fete lyke for to slyp, my steppes were nothyng sure. And why? Because I fondly fall, in enuie and disdayne: To se that foles and wicked men haue peace and byde no payne. They are in no daynger of deathe, nor lykely for to dye: But do remayne excedyng strong and excedynge myghtie. They are free fr? aduersitie, when other men be shent: And wyth the reste they take no parte, of plage or punishment. Wherby they be full gloriously in pride so high extold: And are in wronge and violence, wrapped so manyfold. Theyr eies are solne for verie fat, they are so fallen awaye: The vayne thoughtes of theyr wycked hert, they practise night and daye By theyr wycked exemple are other men corrupted: And the most myghti and high God, by them is blasphemed. For they stretch out theyr mouth to heau? and do agaynst it crie: But on the earth theyr wycked tonge, walketh most pleasantly. The flocke therfore of flaterars, do furnish vp theyr trayne: For there they be full sure to sucke some profite and some gayne. Tush, tush say they, vnto them selues, is ther a God aboue? That doth knowe and suffer this yll, &amp; wyll vs not reproue? Looe, ye maye se howe wycked men in richesse styll encrease: Rewarded well wyth worldly goode, &amp; lyue in rest and peace. Than whye do I from wyckednes my fantasie refrayne? And wash myne handes wyth innocentes, &amp; clense myne hert in vayne? And whye am I scourged ech daye, as subiect to all blame: Or why should I euerie morne, sustayne rebuke and shame? Than had I almost sayed as they, mislykyng myne estate: But that I should thy chyldren iudge, as folke infortunate. I me bethought (therfore) howe I myght thys thynge vnderstand: But yet the laboure was to great, for me to take in hand. Untyll the tyme I went into thyne holye place, and then: I vnderstode right perfectly the ende of all these men. And namely howe thou settest them vpon a slyppry place: And at thy pleasure and thy wyll thou doest them all deface. Than Lorde howe sone do they consume, and fearfully decaye: Euen as a dreame when one waketh, their Image goeth awaye. Thus greued was myne hert full sore, my mynde was much appreste: So fonde was I and ignorant, and in thy syght a beaste. Yet am I styll by the, and thou holdeste my right hand faste: And wyth thy counsell doest guid me to glorie at the laste. Bysyde thy selfe what thynge haue I, in all the heauens aboue: To delyte in, syth in the earth I do the only loue. My flesh and eke myne herte fayle me, so doeth my God neuer: For of myne hert God is the strength, and my parte for euer. And loe all such as the forsake, shal perishe euerichone: And they that trust in any thynge saueynge in the alone. But it is good for me (O God) to holde me faste by the: And to put my full trust in the, and tell what thy worckes be. The .lxxiiij. Psalme. O God why art thou styl absente from vs what displeasure: Hath made thy wrath so hotte against, y? shep of thy pasture? Oh thyncke vp? the church y? hath of aunci?t bene thyne: And that thou hast redemed (Lorde) euen besore our eine. Thyncke on the kynred that is thyne by right succession: And on the place where thou hast dwelt, the holy mount Sion. Lyfte vp thy fote and destroye all the enimies for aye: That haue wrought wyckednes wyth in thyne holy place thys daye. Thyne enimies haue roared in thy c?gregations: And haue erected theyr oxone sygnes, to be sygnes and tokens. Theyr axes are sene glytter as when men hewe wodde on hylles: The selynge of the holye place they breake downe wyth theyr bylles. They haue broken thyne holy thynges &amp; set fyre on the same: They haue broke downe and poluted the dwellyng of thy name. Thus sayd they in theyr herte, let vs all vex them in one bande: So brent they all goddes synagoges, that were found in the land. Our sygnes and tokens we se not, no Prophete doeth remayne: Ther is none emonge vs that can tell vs ought for certayne. O God howe longe shall thyne enmy do the dispyte and shame? Dylt thou suffer him euer to blaspheme thyne holy name? Lord, whye wythdrawest thou thy powre? Why doeth thy right hand byd Styll in thy bosome? pulle it out and let thy foes destryed. O God thou arte my kynge for aye, &amp; haste bene euer more: Ther is none health in all the earth that is not of thy store. In thy great power thou dydest diuide the seas and brakest the head: Of Pharoo that great dragon, who of that wounde is dead. The heades (Lord) of the whale that was, of excedyng greatnes: Thou hast broken and made hym meate to men of wyldernes. A welsprynge and a rennynge streame, thou haste made in drye land: And haste made the great riuers drye, by the power of thyne hand. The day &amp; eke the nyght are thyne thou haste them in thy power: Thou hast prepared lyght &amp; sunne, to serue vs at theyr houre. Thou hast set &amp; appoynted al the limettes of the lande: The sommer &amp; wynter also, are the worcke of thyne hand. Rem?ber this (O Lorde) because, thy foes do the reuile: And the braynsicke and folyshe folke, thyne holy name defyle. Geue not the lyfe of thy turtle into thyne enmies hand: Neyther forget thy churche for aye, that of the pore doeth stande. Be myndfull of thy couenaunt, for all the earth is hyd: Wyth the dwellynges of men that are most cruell and wycked. O suffer not the simple to returne agayne wyth shame: For the pore and the indigent are they that prayse thy name. Aryse (O God) and iudge thy cause, &amp; let thy seruauntes see: That thou art myndfull of the checkes that foles vse to geue the. Do not forget the wordes of them, that wythstand the so sore: for theyr pride and presumption, encreaseth more and more. The .lxxv. Psalme. We do acknowledge the (O God we do acknowledge the: And syth thy name is not far of thy worckes declare wyll we. When I shall call a counsell for to iudge thynges in thy syght: Then shall I geue true sentence and iudge all matters aright. As for the earth is lyke to falle and al that therin dwell: But I haue vnderset hir postes, that she may stand right well. Thus sayd I to the folysh men, se that ye be not madde: And to the wicked, be not proude of ought that maye be had. Do not, I saye, you folysh men, lyfte vp your hornes on hye: Neither do you in co?tenaunce declare your greate folye. For high degre cometh to man neither fr? easte nor weste: Nor yet out of the wyldernes from any cruell beaste. For herin God alone is iudge, to sette vp whom he luste: He lyfteth vp one and casteth an other in the duste. For in his hand he hath a cuppe of stronge and myghtie wyne: Wherof he filleth to all m?, such is his power diuine. The lyes &amp; dregges therof also, he doeth not leaue byhynd: But all the wycked of the earth do them in theyr cuppes fynde. As for me I wyll preach for aye, &amp; synge to Iacobes God: I wyll breake all the wycked hornes euen wyth an Iron rodde. I wyll, I saye, destroy the power of them that be wycked: And suche as delyte in iustice, I wyll se exalted. The .lxxvj. Psalme. In Iuda God is surely know?, and eke in Israell: Hys holy name is had in price, and men lyke it full well. Hys tabernacle and his tent, is in Salem pytched: And in Sion his holy seate and dwellynge is builded. Ther hath he broken the arrowes that came forth of the bowe: The shyld, the swerd, &amp; all the raye, he brake also I knowe. O Lorde thou art much more noble, and more magnificent: Then are the robbars of the hylles that to spoylynge are bent. The men that were of haute courage, are nowe become a praye: They are slayne and haue slept theyr slepe, so slender was theyr staye. All men that were stronge and myghtie &amp; able for to fyght: Haue not by strenght optayned ought, but are turned to flyght. When thou rebukest men that fyght on horsse or in charet: Then are they caste into slumber, and do th?selues forget. For thou (O Iacobes God I saye) arte terrible in dede: And who can abyde in thy syght, when thy wrath is moued? Once thy iuste iudgment was shewed downe from heauen vpon man: Then shoke the earth &amp; great sil?ce through out the same began. This thynge was done when God arose to minister iudgment: And to saue them that on the earth were weake and impotent. For when thou doest punish one man and plageste his furie: Then doest thou put the rest in feare to deale so cruelly. Make and performe vowes to your God, all you that nygh him be: Loke that ye brynge gyftes vnto him, for terrible is he. He stoppeth the breath of rulars, and causeth them to die: And the myghtie kynges of the earth feare him excedyngly. The .lxxvij. Psalme. When I dyd lyfte my voyce to God, and dyd vpon him crye: Then dyd he geue eare vnto me &amp; hearde me wyllyngly. In the daye of my trouble I dyd to the Lorde resort: By nyght my power was scatered, my soule toke no confort. When I called God to my mynde, then was my sprite troubled: And I mourned excedyngly, &amp; my courage faynted. O God thou dydest knowe certenly the watches of myne eies: I was amased and coulde not speake out in any wise. Then dyd I call to memorie, the tymes that erst haue bene: And the years that in the old world our fore fathers haue sene. My verses in the nyght dyd I call to my memorie: And wyth myne herte I c?muned, and dyd myne owne sprite trie. Then sayde I, wyll the Lord forsake his pore seruant for aye? Wyll he neuer be pleasa?t but thus terrible alwaye? Is his loueynge kyndnes quitte lost hath he no more in store? Shall the sprite of true prophecie neuer be heard of more? Hath God forgotten vtterly, howe to be mercifull? Wyl he holde in his mercies lyke a man that is irefull? Yet at the laste, thus dyd I thyncke, this is but my weakenes: For the right hand of the high God, maye chaunge all thynges certes. The worckes of the Lorde wyll I call to memorie therfore: And wyll not forget the w?ders that he dyd heretofore. I wyll also (O God) thyncke on all thy worckes secretly: And to speake of thy counselles Lorde, I wyll my selfe applye. For all thy wayes and thy counselles, are holy and vpright: No God therfore can be so great, as art thou God of myght. For thou alone hast brought to passe thynges straynge and wonderfull: And emonge the people thou hast made thy power notable. For thy people are reuenged by thy great poure full well: That is to saye the chyldren of Iosephe and Israell. The waters dyd se the (O God) the waters dyd se the: And loste theyr strength, and the depe gan amased for to be. The darcke cloudes sent downe showeres of rayne in wonderfull plentie: And the cloudes sent forth thunder clappes, and thy arrowes gan flye. The noyse of thy thunderclappes and the flashes of lyghtnynge: Appeared round about, and the earth fell in a tremblynge. Thy wayes are in the sea and thy pathes in waters full stronge: And thy fote steppes are not espyed, either of olde or yonge. Thou dydeste leade thy people lyke a simple flocke of shepe: And by the hand of Moses and Aaron thou dydest them kepe. The .lxxviij. Psalme. Attend my people to my lawe, and to my wordes enclyne: My mouthe shall speake strange parables, and sentences diuine. Which we our selues haue heard &amp; seene, emonge men that are olde: And that for our enstructi? our fathers haue vs told. We wyll not therfore hyde these thynges from theyr posteritie: But to them that shall come after, we wyll tell them playnly. We wyll (I saye) tell the Lordes prayse, his strength and hys glorie: And eke all hys wonderfull workes, to oure posteritie. For wyth a certen charge he gaue a lawe in Israell Whiche was that all fathers shoulde these thynges to theyr chyldren tell. That theyr posteritie, that is, theyr sonnes yonge and tender: Myght when they come to age knowe them and teache them theyr chylder. That they myght haue the better hope in God that is aboue: And haue his holy worckes in mynde, &amp; kepe his lawes, for loue. And not be lyke theyr fathers that were false and of such sprite: That would not frame theyr wycked hertes to credite God aright. The sonnes of Ephraim w?t out in armes and thought to spoyle: Shothyng theyr dartes, yet in the daye of warre they toke the foyle. For whye? they dyd not kepe wyth God, the promise that was made: Nor yet would walke or leade theyr lyfe accordynge to his trade. But they forgate his worckes &amp; eke they smally estemed: The wonderfull and noble actes, that to th? he shewed. Wythin the land of Egypt and, in the field of Tanim: In the syght of theyr fathers were great wonders wrought by him. He dyd diuide and cut the sea, and brought them through it drye: And bade the waters stand as styll as thynges heaped on hye. He led th? secret in a cloude, by daye when it was bryght: And all the nyght when it was darcke, wyth fyer he gaue them lyght. He brake the rockes in wyldernes &amp; gaue the people dryncke: As plentifull as when the welles do flowe vp to the bryncke. Out of the rocke of stone he brought fresh water streames at nede: And made the waters for to r?ne lyke great riuers in dede. Yet for all this agaynst the Lord, theyr synne dyd styll encrease: And styrred him that is most hygh to wrath in wyldernes. They tempted God wythin theyr hertes, lyke people of mistruste: When they cried to haue such meate as serued to theyr luste. Then sayde they thus, agaynst the Lorde in theyr vnfaythfullnes: How can this God prepare for vs a feaste in wyldernes? Beholde he strake the stony rocke, &amp; floudes furthwyth dyd flowe: But can he geue to his people, boeth bread and fleshe also? When God heard thys, he waxed wrath wyth Iacob and hys sede: So dyd his indignation, on Israell procede. Because they dyd not faythfully, beleue &amp; hope that he: Coulde alwayes helpe and succour them in theyr necessitie. He gaue charge to the cloudes aboue, and they brake in sunder: And rayned them Manna to eate, a meate of great wonder. He gaue them heauenly grayne, I saye, man fed on stronge mens foede: He sent vitayles downe vnto th?, much more then dyd them good. He caused the easte wynde to cease vnder the heauens hye: And the southwest wynde he brought in by hys power by and by. Then fell downe flesh as thycke as dust, &amp; foule, lyke the sea sande: Which he dyd caste a mydde the place, wher all theyr tentes dyd stande. Then dyd they eate excedyngly, &amp; all men had theyr fylles: He fatisfied theyr appetites, accordynge to theyr wylles. But as the meate was in theyr mouthes, hys wrath vpon them fell: And slewe the floure of all the youth and choyse of Israell. Yet fell they to theyr wonted synne, and styll they dyd him greue: For all the wonders that he wrought they had no faste beleue. Theyr dayes therfore he shortened, and would not let them raigne: And all theyr yeres he finished, in right shot space certayne. But euer wh? he plaged them, they sought him by and by: Rem?brynge then he was theyr strength &amp; helpe as God most hye. Though wyth theyr mouthes they dyd but glose, and flatter wyth the Lorde: And wyth theyr tonges dyd faynedly diss?ble euerie worde. For whye? theyr hertes were nothynge bent to him nor to his trade: Nor yet to kepe or to performe, the promise that was made. Yet was he styll so merciful, to th? worthy to dye: That he forgaue theyr wyckednes, &amp; would not them destroye. Yea ofte tymes he turned his wrath and dyd himselfe aduise: And would not suffer al his whole displeasure to arise. Remembryng that they were but flesh, and euen as a wynde: That passeth awaye and cannot returne by it owne kynde. Howe often tymes in wyldernes, dyd they theyr Lorde prouoke? Howe dyd they moue and styr theyr Lorde, to plage them wyth his stroke? And how ofte dyd they turne awaye, from God him forto proue? Teachyng Israelse holy one what thynges dyd him behoue. They were not myedfull of his power nor of the daye when he: Redemed them from strayte bondage and great captiuitie. Neither had they in memorie, y? wonders wrought by him: In Egypt, and in the contrey, that lyeth about Tanim. When by his greate power he turned theyr waters into bloud: That no man myght receyue his drincke at riuer ne at floud. A multitude of flyes also, he sent them to deuoure: And paddockes that should them destroye, such was his myghtie power. Theyr fruites and theyr encrease he gaue, to the caterpyller: And al the laboure of theyr handes, vnto the grasse hopper. Wyth hayle he dyd he stroye theyr vynes, so that they were all loste: And beate downe theyr mubberie tres wyth stones made by the froste. And yet wyth haylstones once agayne, the Lorde theyr cattell smote: And all theyr flockes and herbes lykewise, wyth thunder boltes full hote. He caste on th? his hote anger, his wrath and furie stronge: Greate sorowe of herte and angelles yll, to trouble them emonge. Th? to his wrath he made awaye, &amp; spared not the leaste: But gaue vnto the pestilence, the man &amp; eke the beaste. He strake also all the fyrst borne, that vp in Egypt came: And all the eldest or fyrste borne wythin the tentes of Cham. But as for all his owne deare flocke, he dyd preserue and kepe: And caried them through wyldernes, euen lyke a flocke of shepe. Wythout all feare boeth safe and sounde, he brought them out of thrall Whereas his foes wyth rage of seas, were ouerwhelmed all. And he led them into the boundes of hys sanctuarie: Euen to this hyll which hys right hande and myghtie power dyd bye. Thense caste he forth the Heathen flocke, and dyd theyr land diuide: And in theyr tentes hath he caused Iacobs kynred to byde. Yet dyd they for all this prouoke, and styr vp theyr God styll: And would not kepe his testament, nor yet obeye hys wyll. But as theyr fathers turned backe, euen so they went a straye: Much lyke a bowe that woulde not bende, but breake and starte awaye. Wyth the aultares that they buylded on hylles that were so hye: And wyth theyr ymages they dyd, prouoke God to enuie. This heard God, and his wrath began to kyndle in hys breste: And for theyr wyckednes he dyd them much hate and deteste. In so much that he lefte Silo, the tent or dwellyng place: Wherin before he had dwelled amonge men for aspace. He let them take the arcke also, wherin his powre doeth stand: And gaue vp his magnificence into hys enmies hande. His people he gaue to the swerde, wrath wyth his heritage: Fyer eate the yonge men and the maydes came not to mariage. And wyth the swerd y? priestes dyd, perishe euerychone: And not a wydowe lefte on lyue, theyr hard chaunce to bemone. Wyth that the Lorde began to wake, as slepe had helde hys eiene: Or as a myghtie champi? reioyseynge after wyne. The plage of pyles he sent his foes euen in the fundement: And put vp? them such a shame, as shoulde be permanent. This not wythstandynge, Iosephes rent he dyd franckly refuse: And the kynred of Ephraim, he woulde in no wyse chuse. But the kynred of Iude he hathe, chosen therin to dwell: Euen the holy mounte Sion, whiche he dyd loue so well. Ther dyd he buyld vp his temple boeth sumptuously and sure: Lyke to the grounde that he hath made for euer to endure. Than chose he Dauid hym to serue, hys people for to kepe: And hym he toke and brought awaye, euen from the foldes of shepe. As he went after bagged ewes, the Lorde dyd hym aduaunce: To fede his people Israell, and hys enheritaunce. Then Dauid wyth a faythfull herte dyd them pasture and fede: And dyd prudentlye to hys power, gouerne them all in dede. The .lxxix. Psalme. Into thyne heritage (O God) the Heathen are entred: The palayce of thyne holye place, Lorde they haue defyled. They haue also brought thy citie, holye Hierusalem: Into an hudge and moste rude heape, as it hath pleased them. Wyth thy seruantes deade bodies they haue fed the foules that flye: And the beastes of the earth wyth fleshe of men that lyued godly. They shed theyr bloude, lyke as water about Hierusalem: And ther is none remaynynge that myght take and burie them. Our neighbours haue reuiled vs as men that are forlorne: And they that dwell rownde about vs, haue laughed vs to scorne. Howe longe (O Lorde) how longe I saye? wilt thou be wrath for aye? Shall thyne enuie burne lyke fyer, whose heate doeth not decaye? Pour out thy wrath on the heathen that do not the confesse: And on the kyngdomes that do not call on the in distresse. For they haue deuoured Iacob, and eaten hym vp quite: And haue destroyed all his dwellyng howses in dispyte. Remember not our former synnes, but forgeue vs quickly: For we are weakened (good Lorde) and that excedyngly. O the God of our health helpe vs, for the prayse of thy name: Deliuer vs, and take mercie on our synnes, for the same. Why should the Heathen saye, where is theyr God whom they do prayse? Reuenge the bloude of thy seruantes on th? (Lorde) in our dayes. Let the gronynges of the captyue ascend vp in thy syght: And them that be iudged to dye, kepe on lyue by thy myght. O Lorde requite oure neyghbours wyth seuen tymes the open shame: That they haue gone about to laye vpon thyne holy name. So we that be thy people and the flocke of thy pasture: Shall setforth &amp; declare thy prayse, whylse the world shall endure. The .lxxx. Psalme. O thou shepeherd of Israell, of my wordes take good kepe: Thou that doest leade forth Ioseph as he were a flocke of shepe. O thou I saye that haste thy seate vpon the Cherubim: Shyne forth vpon thy pore seruant, &amp; shewe thyselfe to him. Before Ephraim Beniamim, &amp; Manasses also: Styr vp thy power and come to saue thy pore seruauntes from wo. O God, restore vs once agayne, and make thy face to shyne: And then shall thy seruauntes be salfe in thy presence diuine. O Lord and God of hostes, howe longe wylt thou be angerie? And how longe wylt thou the requestes of thy people denie? Thou hast fed them wyth dolfoull teares, euen as wyth bread I thyncke: And hast droncke to th? of a cup, full of teares to the bryncke. Thou haste appoynted vs to be our neighbours mockynge stockes: And to suffer our enimes, to lade vs wyth theyr mockes. O God restore vs once agayne, and make thy face to shyne: And then shall thy seruauntes be safe, in thy presence diuine. Out of Egypt (Lord) thou hast brought the vyne of Israell: And for place to plant it in thou, dydste the heathen expell. Thou dydeste purge the rynde ther of and that diligently: And wh? it was roted it dyd, the whole earth occupie. The shadowe therof dyd couer the hylles that be so hye: And hir bowes the great Ceder trees, that be stronge and myghtie. She stretched furth to the sea syde, hir braunches that were stoute: And vnto the fresh water syde, hir buddes she dyd shote out. Why hast thou broken downe hir hedge, that whoe so passeth by: Maye plucke and break of hir braunches, and cause hir rote to die? The wylde bore of the foreste doeth, hir vtterly destroye: And all wyld beastes of the field, do eate hir gredily. O God of hostes we the besech, returne, loke out from hye: Loke hyther &amp; come downe to se, thys vyneyard by and by. Uiset, I saye, the vineyard that, thy right hand hath planted: And this ofsprynge whych to thy selfe thou haste so assured. It is burned vp wyth fyer, and is hewen downe quite: They muste nedes perishe if thou do, loke on them wyth despyte. Wyth the man of thy ryght hand let, thy power and strength remayne: And wyth the sonne of man whom thou doest wyth the entertayne. Then shall we not returne from the, that doest our lyfe restore: But wyll call on thyne holy name, for aye &amp; euermore. Restore vs (O Lord God of hostes) &amp; make thy face to shyne: And then shall thy seruauntes be salfe in thy presence diuine. The .lxxxj. Psalme. Synge vnto God with reioyseynge, who is our force and myght: And endeuour wyth lowde trompettes Iacobs God to delyght. Begyne a Psalme and playe to it, with tabrete and wyth harpe: And wyth the swete and solemne lute wyth notes pleasaunt and sharp. Blowe wyth the horne the blastes that are vsed at the newe mone: The tyme wherin our sacrifice is poynted to be done. For this is a rite and custome of strength in Israell: And a lawe that wyth Iacobs God hath bene accepted well. And thys remembraunce dyd he leaue emonge Iosephes kynred: Wh? by his myghtie power they were, salfly from Egypt led. O Israell my thyncke I heare, a voyce worthy regard: The language is but strange to me, such as I haue not hearde. Thus sayeth the voyce. I haue pulled his shoulder from burden: And hys hande dyd leaue the labour, of the great breke ouen. In trouble I dyd set the quyte, when thou dydste on me crye: And gaue an answere vnto the, by thunder secretly. And when thou dydste contend wyth me, at the waters of stryfe: I had a suer triall of the maner of thy lyfe. But hearken O my people, for my worde shall the assure: If thou wylt hearken to my voyce, my wyll and my pleasure. There shalbe no straynge God in the, se thou do them not kepe: Take hede that in nowyse thou do, any str?g God worshype. Thy Lorde and God am I that haue the out of Egypt brought Open thy mouth &amp; aske of me, I wyll denie the nougth. But my people heard not my voyce, Iacob dyd me forsake: Wherfore I gaue them libertie, theyr hertes desyre to take. Oh if my people had heard me, &amp; walked in my waye: Howe sone should I haue brought all theyr enimies to decaye? And howe sone should I haue turned, my powre agaynst them all: That do infest and trouble them, as people bond and thrall? All such men as do hate the Lorde, theyr bond slaues should haue bene: But the ende of my peoples dayes neuer man should haue sene. I would haue fed them wyth the floure, and fyneste of the wheate: Out of the rocke they shoulde haue had, honye whylse they would eate. The .lxxxij. Psalme. In the c?panie of iudges, God stode amyd them all And gaue sentence on them that were in iudgment partiall. Howe longe, sayde he, wyll you deserne &amp; iudge matters awrye? Howe longe wyll you pervert iudgment, and iudge thynges contrarie? Reuenge the rore &amp; fatherlesse, discharge the wretch of bandes: Ryd the weake &amp; the nedie out of the wycked mens handes. But they ne know nor vnderstand ought, but walke in the waye: Of dearknes, wherby the whole earth is lykly to decaye. Certes, I sayde you are all goddes, and sonnes of the moste hye: But yet as men and eke tyrannes, ye shall falle downe and die. Arise (O God) and iudge the earth, for to the do belonge: (By thy byrth ryght) all nations, be they neuer so stronge. The .lxxxiij. Psalme. O God, behold thou kepest in thy selfe in silence styll: Dissemble not (O God) ne cease to worcke after thy wyll. Forlo, thyne enmies make vprores, &amp; they that do the hate: Lyfte vp theyr heades, and do nothynge of theyr courage debate. They haue c?sulted subtyly, Lord agaynst thy people: And agaynste thyne electe these men haue holden a counsell. Come on (sayde they) let vs destroye them and theyr nation: Let there remayne of Iacobs name, no maner mention. For wyth consent of herte these haue conspired together: And made a couenaunt agaynste the that lyueste euer. That is to saye the Edomites and eke the Ismalites: The Moabites, the Hagarenes, and eke the Gebalites. The Amonites, Amalekites, and eke the palestines. And they that dwell in Tiria, and in all the confines. To them also are ioyned the assirians I wotte: Who were the chiefe ayed and succoure vnto the sonnes of lot. As thou dydst to Madianites, at the riuer Kison: And to Siser, and to Labin, so do to these echone. For they were broken at Endor, &amp; therby brought so lowe: That from the donghill of the earth, no man could them well knowe. Let these men and theyr rulars haue the thynge that Oreb had: And as Seeb, Sebah and Salumna do th? rewarde. These men haue sayed, let vs calendge &amp; cleym to vs and ours: Al the tabernacles of God, his dwellynges &amp; his bowres. O my God, make th? lyke a wheele, that no sure rest doeth fynd: And as the stubble of the earth, that rouleth wyth the wynde. Let them be lyke the fyer that causeth great woodes to frye: And lyke the flamme that burneth vp, the mountaynes greate and hye. So persecute them with thy stormes that they do no rest fynde: And cast them flatte vpon the grounde, with thy myghtie whyrlwynde: Lord, dashe al theyr faces ful of ignominie and shame: That they maye be forced to seke after thyne holy name. Let theyr shame and confusion be more &amp; more dayly: Let them be shamed &amp; then let them perishe vtterly. That they maye knowe that thou (whose name is Lorde) art he only: That beaxeste rule through all the earth, as Lorde and God most hye. The .lxxxiiij. Psalme. O Lorde of hostes, how bewtifull and howe goodly in syght: Are the tabernacles &amp; tentes, that in thy champe are pight? To dwel in the Lordes courtes, my soule doeth longe excedynglye: And to be wyth the lyueynge God, myne herte and fleshe do crye. For the verie sparowe hath founde a place wherin to dwell: And the swallowe a neste where she maye kepe hir yonge ones well. O Lord of myght, that arte my kyng and eke my God for aye: Thyne altares are the place wheron these byrdes do fynde theyr staye. Happie and blessed are all they that in thyne house do dwell: For they shall styll extoll thy name and thy great prayses tell. Happie are the men that do put theyr confidence in the: And in whose hertes thyne holy wayes are euident to se. When they passe through the vale of teares, wyth welles they shall it store: And the rayne shall fyll the fyshe pondes tyll they wyll hold no more. From heape to heape they shall procede, in greate possession: Eche of them shal playnly appeare before god in Sion. Lord God of hostes, heare my prayer, O Iacobs God take hede: O God our shild behold the face of Christ thyne anoynted. For in thy courtes one daye passeth, a thousand dayes elsewhere: At thy dore, then in wycked tentes, I would dwelle much rather. For the Lord God is a cleare sunne, &amp; eke a tergat sure: And geueth grace, honour, and all good thynges vnto the pure. O Lorde of hostes, that man is bleste and must nedes happye be: That putteth hys only trust &amp; his c?fidence in the. The .lxxxv. Psalme. O Lorde thou wylt be mercifull to thyne owne lande doubtlesse: And wylt ryd all Iacobs kynred, from thrauldome and distresse. The wyckednes of thy people, Lorde thou wylt take awaye: And all theyr synnes &amp; trespases, thou wylt hyde I dare saye. Thou wylt take awaye all thyne heate &amp; furiouse feruour: And wylt asswage thyne hotte anger and wrathfull displeasure. Restore vs, O God of our health and our saluation: Restore vs, and leaue of thy wrath and indignation. What? Wylt thou be styll wrath wyth vs, shall thyne Ire haue none ende: Wylt thou thy furie to the laste of all ages extende? Arte thou not he that wyll returne and vs to lyfe restore? That thy people maye be praysed in the for euermore? O Lorde shewe vs thy greate goodnes, and excedynge mercie: And of thy saueynge health let thy pore seruantes haue plentie. I wyll heare what the Lorde sayeth, for al hys wordes doubtlesse: Do byd his people and his saynctes, declyne from wyckednes: Certes his health is not far of, from them that do hym feare: So that our contrey nedeth not, of honoure to despeare. Mercie and trueth are met in one and are come togither: So haue iustice and peace ioyned, kyssynge one the other. Fayeth shall sprynge vp out of the earth, hir rote shall not decaye: And iustice shall loke downe from far, out of the heauens graye. The Lorde also shall geue mercie, and our land hir encrease: And iustice shall walke before God, &amp; treade in the playne wayes. The .lxxxvj. Psalme. O Lorde geue eare to thy seruant, and graunt me my request: For I (a pore and simple wretch) am vexed and oppreste. Preserue my lyfe (O Lord) because, my lyueynge is vpright Do thou saue thy seruant (O God) who trusteth in thy myght. Be good to me (O Lord) because, I call on the dayly: There thou my mynde, for vnto the (O Lord) I lyfte it hye. For thou (O Lorde) arte good in dede, and eke full of mercie: Thy bountifull goodnes is large, towardes all that on the crie. Geue eare (O Lord) to my prayer, &amp; ponder my request: In my trouble I call on the, for to heare thou arte prest. Ther is not one amonge the goddes (O Lord) lyke vnto the: Neither is there any that doeth such worckes as thy worckes be. All nations that thou haste made, shall come and honour the: And shall setforth thy name (O Lorde) wyth prayse and wyth glorie. And that because thou alone arte great and stronge in theyr syght: And doest wonderfull actes, and arte alone the God of myght. Direct me in thy wayes and I shall in thy trueth procede: O Lorde constrayne myne herte to feare thyne holy name in dede. I wyll prayse the (O Lord my God) &amp; that wyth all myne herte: And from the prayses of thy name, my mynde shall neuer sterte. For doubtlesse thy mercie towardes me doeth in greatnes excell: For thou haste rydde my soule out of the lougher pyt of hell. The proude &amp; arrogant (O God) are risen agaynst me: And the cruell sorte seke my soule, and haue no feare of the. But thou (Lorde God) arte redie to mercie and forgeuenes: Slowe to anger, longe sufferyng, and full of faythfullnes. Loke backe and take mercie on me, Lorde after thyne olde wonne: Geue thy strength to thy pore seruaunte, &amp; saue thyne handmaydes sonne. Shewe some signe of thy loue toward me, that such as do me hate: Maye shame to se that thou Lorde dost me helpe and consolate. The .lxxxvij. Psalme. The bases and foundations of Sion are faste set: In the mountaynes and hylles that are boeth holye and sacrete. The Lorde beareth more fauour to the cities of Sion: Then he doeth to the residue of Iacobs nation. Ryght noble thynges (O goddes citie) are reported of the: Reported in the (O Sion) right noble thynges there be. Rahab, and such of Babilon as haue knowen my name: I wyll haue kepte in memorie, as right worthy of fame. Loe palestine is worthy prayse, because therin were borne: Boeth Zor and they of Ethiope, of whom I thyncke no scorne. But of Sion it shall be sayed, that many of greate fame: Haue bene borne there, &amp; the high God shall eke confirme the same. In his writtynges the Lord shall cyte the peoples euerie one: And of them all, the chyefest man was borne in this Sion. In the (Sion) are all my welles where out all they do sprynge: That in my trase do leade the daunce, &amp; do my praises synge. The .lxxxviij. Psalme. Lorde God myne health, before thy face I crye boeth daye and nyght: Let my request, I the besech, be present in thy syght. Bowe downe thyne eare vnto my cry, for my soule hath hir fyll: And my lyfe is brought to y? graue, through the plentie of ill. But now am I compted wyth them, that go into the pyt: And am compared to a man, that of strength hath no whyt. As one fre from all maner thynges that to thys lyfe belonge: I am accompted emonge them, whom fatall death hath stonge. I am I saye lyke to the deade, that in the graue do slepe: Of wh? there is no memorie, ne doeth thyne hand them kepe. In the lower pyt of troubles, Lord thou hast placed me: In places that are darcke &amp; depe so hath it, pleased the. Thy feruent indignation, hath quelled me well most: Thou hast cast out thy pore seruaunt, in troubles to be toste. Thou haste caused myne acquayntaunce, to flye far of from me: And through thy meanes they do abhor, thy pore seruant to se. I am enclosed in suche wyse and hedged rounde about: That I ne can by any meanes, fynde ishue or waye out. Through sore payne and afliction, myne eye syght fayleth me: O Lorde I call and crie all daye, and lyfte myne handes to the. And doest thou shewe wonders to them that in the graue do lye? Or shall the deade arise agayne, and prayse the worthyly? And shall thy mercie and goodnes be preached in the graue? Or thy fayth in destruction, wher none hath mynde to craue? Or shall thy wonders be well knowen in places darke and blynd? Or thy iustice in such a place, where nothing is in mynde? But I (thy pore seruant) haue cried to the (O Lorde) I saye: And my prayer shall the preu?t in the spryng of the daye. O Lord whye doest thou put me backe, and my pore soule repell? Wylt thou (Lord) hyde thy face from me, and shewe thy selfe cruell? Wretched am I, and from my youth haue ben styll at deathes dore: And wyth perplex and doubtfull mynde I sustayne thy terrour. Thy furies and rageynge angers, haue gone ouer me quite: And thy terrours and great threatnynges, haue kylled me downryght. They haue dayly enuironed, and beset me about: And to gyrd me in togither, they haue not stand in doubt. My friendes thou haste set far from me, &amp; eke my neyghbours all: And haste caused myne acquayntaunce into darcknes to fall. The .lxxxix. Psalme. Thy mercies and thy goodnes Lorde I wyll synge wythout staye And wyth my mouth (Lord) wyll I cause, thy truth be knowe for aye. For wyth my selfe, thus haue I thought Goddes mercie lasteth aye: And in the hygh heauens his trueth he hath set wyth sure staye. Thus hath he sayd, wyth mynde elect I haue made a commaunt: And wyth anothe I promised, to Dauid my seruant. Thy seede I wyll confirme for aye, &amp; make it to enduer: And in all ages that shall come, thy throne shall remayne sure. The heauens (O Lord) celebrate, &amp; prayse thy wonders all: So do the sanctes thyne holy trueth, when they theyr counselles call. In heauen, who is it that maye be the Lordes felowe right? And which of the stronge men shalbe, lyke vnto him in myght? For God muste be greatly feared in holy mens counsell: And must be had in reuerence of them that nygh hym dwell. Lorde God of hostes, who is lyke the? Oh thou that art myghtie: All thynges that are about the Lorde, are truth and veritie. Lord thou doest rule the greate furies and rages of the seas: And when they do lyft vp their waues, thou doest them all appease. Proude Pharao thou dydest beate, euen as a deade bodie: And wyth the force of thy great strength, thou dydst thy foes destroye. The heauens are thyne, so is the earth, none can thys thynge denie: The whole worlde and all thynges therin, thou haste made certenly. The north parte and the south also, thou haste made and formed: Thabor and Hermon shall reioyce, wh? they heare the named. Thou haste an arme full of all powre, all myght doeth therin stande: Lorde thou doest fortifie thy strength, &amp; lyfte vp thy ryght hande. Thy pryncelyke throne is vndersette, with equitie and right: Mercie and trueth go before the, and are styl in thy syght. O happie people that confesse, the sygnes of goddes presence: For in thy lyght (O Lorde) suche shall walke wyth greate reuerence. They shall dayly ioye and reioyce, Lorde in thyne holy name: And in thy ryghtuousenes they shall, purchase them selfe greate fame. For of theyr force &amp; strength (O God) thou only arte the floure: And of thy mere goodnes thou wylt extolle our myght and power. For our shyld of defence is a thynge of the lordes geuynge: And the holy one of Iacob, hath geuen vs our kynge. Then to thy prophetes (by a dreame) thus saydest thou, in effect: I wyll supporte &amp; ayde Dauid, for he is myne elect. I haue found Dauid my seruant, &amp; haue hym anoynted: Wyth holy oyle that by my power he myght be strengthened. The enimie shall neuer be, able hym to deceyue: Neither shall the froward haue powre, my seruant for to greue. I wyl braye all his enimies, euen before his face: And suche as do hym hate I wyll destroye wyth outen grace. My trueth &amp; eke my mercie shall be wyth hym at his nede: And in my name his power shal be excedyng great in dede. I wyll put his hand in the sea, his power shall thyther reach: And ouer the rennynge riuers, he shall hys ryght hand stretche. He shall call on me at his nede and shall saye in this sorte: Thou arte my father and my God, and of my health the forte. Myne he yer wyll I ordeyne hym, aboue the kynges all: My mercie and promise to him, for euer kepe I shall. I wyll make hys sede eternall his stocke shall neuer die: And his royall seate wyll I make, lyke the tyme of the skye. If hys sonnes wyll forsake my lawe and not walke in my steppes: If they wyll breake myne ordina?ce and not kepe my preceptes Then wyth roddes wyll I visyte them, for theyr goynge astraye: And wyll wyth scourges punish the wyckednes of theyr waye. Yet my mercie and greate goodnes wyll I not take from hym: Ne breake my couenaunt wyth hym, for my trueth I esteme. I wyll not breake my couenaunt, neither my wordes denie: I wyll not chaunge but be the same, &amp; neuer contrarie. I sware once by myne holinesse, &amp; therto wyll I cleaue: I wyll kepe promise wyth Dauid, I wyl hym not deceyue. His sede shall be perpetuall, it shall neuer decaye: His royall seate shall continue as longe as nyght and daye. It shall be as fyrme and as sure, as the mone in the skye: Which is a most certen wytnes in the heau? so hye. But thou haste forsaken Dauid, and arte turned awaye: Thou burnest wyth anger agaynste thy Christe and kynge I saye. The promisse that thou madeste wyth thy seruante thou haste broke: And hast caste his crowne to the grownde by the force of thy stroke. All his hedges thou haste pulde vp, &amp; lefte him wyde open: His fences and his suer moundes, thou hast torne and broken. Eche man that passeth by the way, taketh at him a snatch: His neighbours do laugh him to scorne, and vse him lyke a patche. Thou haste set vp the powre of them that do him sore infeste: And haste made them that be his foes, to reioyce and to ieste. Yea the edge of his swerde thou hast made so dull as a barre: Thou haste not geuen him uictorie, ne thupper hand in warre. Thou haste caused his dignitie, to cease &amp; not be founde: His royall throne and princely seate, thou haste caste to the grownde. His yonge &amp; lustie dayes thou haste cutte of and shortened: Wyth shame, reprofe and dishonour, thou haste him couered. Howe longe wylt thou be hyd (O Lorde) wylt thou be hyd for aye? Shal thyne hote indignati? burne lyke fyre wythout staye? Remembre howe smal tyme I haue lyued, and saye certayne: Whether thou haste created and, made all mankynd in vayne. For what man is he that lyueth, and that none ende shall haue? And that is able to preserue, his lyfe out of the graue? O Lorde, where be thyne olde mercies, and auncient goodnes: Which thou swarest vnto Dauid euen of thy faithfulnes. Be myndfull Lorde of the rebuke that thy seruantes sustayne: All the rebukes of muche people in my bosome remayne. They are thyne enimies (O Lorde) that haue vs reuiled: And haue checked the tariaunce, of Christe thyne annoynted. For euer ought the Lorde to be praysed emonge all men: Praysed be he therfore I saye, for aye. Amen Amen. The .xc. Psalme O Lorde thou haste bene oure refuge, and place wherin to dwell: In all the tyme that erste hath bene, so longe as tonge can tell. Before the mountaynes were vp spronge and the rownde earth formed: From all ages that euer were, thou haste bene God in dede. Thou leadest man backe tyll he be well most grownde in sunder: And then thou sayest (O mortall men) retourne agayne hither. For in thy syght a thousand yere are as the daye laste paste: And as the quarters of the nyght, that passe awaye in haste. Thou makest them to passe awaye hastly as doeth a sure: They are lyke dreames and as the grasse, they do not longe endure. As in the morne the grasse is grene, and gathereth him myght: So doeth it drye &amp; is cut downe agayne ere it be nyght. For thyne anger maketh vs faynte, and as weake as a strawe: And when thy wrath is kendeled, then do we stande in awe. Thou haste set oure iniquities playnly before thy syght: And all our secrete synnes thou haste, made open in the lyght. When thou art wrath, then all our dayes do passe and slyde awaye: We ende our yeres in shortter space, th? any man can saye. The yeres that we vse to lyue here, are but three score and ten: And if any lyue to toure score, they are verie olde men. Nowe the verie beste of this tyme, is but labour and payne: And yet it passeth sone awaye, and wee are gone agayne. Who knoweth the force of thy wrathe, and of thy displeasure? For on him that feareth the moste, thy wrath lyghteth most sure. Tell vs playnly therfore that we maye knowe the certen summe: Of our lyfe dayes, &amp; then apply our myndes to get wisedome. Returne (O Lorde) howe far, I saye, shall thy furie extend? Be pleased with thy pore seruantes, let them not the offende. Satisfie vs wyth thy mercie, erly before the prime: Then shall we reioyce and be glad, all the dayes of our tyme. For the dayes in the which we dyd thy punishment sustayne: And for the yeres of miserie, make vs reioyce agayne. Let thy worcke shyne in thy seruantes, let them be knowne for thyne: And in the chyldren of them all, Lord let thy glorie shyne. Thy decor and thy comlynes, Lord God be in vs aye: Confirme thou the worckes of oure handes, confirme thou them I saye. The .xcj. Psalme. Whoso resteth in the secrete, counsel of the most hye: The same abydeth in the shadowe of the most myghtie. Unto the Lorde thus wyll I saye: Thou arte my sanctuarie: Thou arte my castell of defence, to my God cleaue wyll I. For he wyl kepe his seruant from the snare of the hunttar: And from the deadly plage that is, the commune distroyar. With his wynges wyl he couer the, ryght false shalt thou be there: Thou shalt be hyd vnder hys trueth, as vnder shylde and spere. Thou shalt not nede to stande in feare, of soden feares by nyght: Neither of the sharp arrowe that doeth flye by the day lyght. Thou shalt not nede to feare the plage, that woundeth in the darcke: Nor that destroyeth when the sunne, passeth by the none marcke. For though one thousand fall by the and ten at thy right hand: Yet shall there no hurte come at the, thou shalt in saftie stande. Thou shalt see lyke for lyke geuen, only to the wycked: And wyth thyne owne eies shalt thou see, these thynges executed. For thou (O Lord) arte my refuge, wherin my trust doeth lye: Thy dwellynge place thou hast pytched, in a place verie hye. No maner yll shall come at the, thou shalt be in saftie: Neither shal anye plage approch, or to thyne house drawe nye. For he shall geue commaundement to his angelles for thy sake: That they shall kepe the in thy wayes, and the charge of the take. In theyr handes shall they carie, the and sa fly the conueis: That thou ne dashe thy foete agaynste, any stone in the waye. Thou shalt tread on the Leopard, and eke the adder fell: So shalt thou spurne the Lions whelpe &amp; the dragon cruell. Because he hath embraced me, he shall not suffer shame: I wyll geue him the vpper hand, for he c?fest my name. He shall call on me and I wyll, heare and succour his nede: I wyll deliuer him and make, him gloriouse in dede. His lyfe shall be so longe that he shall wysh to lyue no more: Myne health and my saluation, I wyll geue him in store. The .xcij. Psalme. Nowe is it mete (O thou most high) to synge vnto thy name: And for to celebrate the Lorde, and to encrease his fame. To preach his mercie and goodnes erly before the pryme: And also to declare his sayth, and trueth in the nyght tyme. On the instrument of ten strynges and lute wyth notes sharppe: And eke on the lowde instrumentes, and also on the harppe. For thou (O Lorde) haste wyth thy worckes, made me merie and glad: In the worckes of thyne handes I wyll reioyce and not be sadde. O Lorde, howe greate and myghtie are thy worckes in this worlde rownde? Thy counselles are excedynge depe, and eke passynge profounde. A grosse heade and one of dull wytte doeth not perceyue this thynge: Neither hath the fole in this case any vnderstandynge. That is, that where the wycked do lyke grasse growe and florishe: They floryshe to none other ende, but for aye to perishe. But thou (O Lorde) art high for aye, forlo thy foes do die: So manye as delyte to synne, do perishe vtterly. But myne horne and my strength shall be lyfte vp and set on hye Lyke the horne of an Unicorne, a beaste stronge and myghtie. I shall be annoynted wyth oyle that is boeth newe and freshe: There shall no cause of feblenes, remayne wyth in my fleshe Myne eie shall se his onwe desyre, vpon myne enimies: And myne eare shal heare lyke of them, that do agaynst me rise. The iuste shal florish lyke the palme whose leafe is euer grene: And shall growe vp lyke ceder trees, that in Libane be sene. For they beynge set and planted, in the house of the Lorde: Shall flourishe in the courtes of our God &amp; spreade out abrode. Yea they shall budde and brynge forth fruite when they are far in age They shall be full of sappe and iuse, theyr colour shall not swage. That they maye preach the Lord (that is my strength) to deale iustly: And that in him is no deceyte, he doeth nothynge awrye. The .xciij. Psalme. The Lord is kynge and hath put on magificence princely: The Lorde I saye hath put on strength, and made himselfe redie. Yea the rounde compasse of the earth is made so firme and sure: That it shall not threathen to fall, but shall stand and endure. Thy throne (O Lorde) and princely seate, was appoynted before: From the begymynge, and thy selfe haste bene for euermore. The freshe waters lyfte vp theyr noyse, they lyfte it vp on hye: Theyr surges &amp; theyr waues they do, lyfte vp towarde the skye. Yea more then the wylde waters and the greate stormes of the sea: Such is the great powre of the Lorde, that in heauen hath the swea. For that thou (Lord) haste spoken of thyne house fayre and holy: The same shall remayne firme &amp; true, tyme out of memorie. The .xciiij. Psalme. Oh Lorde God, thou that plagest them that do lyue wyckedly: O thou reuengeynge God I saye, shewe thy selfe openly. Auaunce thy selfe, O thou y? arte iudge ouer all the land: And let the proude haue theyr iuste hyer, &amp; rewarde at thyne hand. Howe longe? howe longe (O Lord) shall the wycked reioice proudly? Shall they all scape, and bragge and boste themselues outragiousely? O Lord they do freate thy people, &amp; weare them cleane awaye: Such as thou cleymest by byrth ryght, they vexe and greue, I saye. They do kyl wydowes and strangers, and murder fatherlesse: And then they saye the Lorde seeth not, Iacobs God hath no gesse. Ye doltysh sorte of the people, to learne I you aduise: Ye foles I saye, what tyme shall we, se you prudent and wyse? Howe should he that hath made the eare, lacke the powre of hearynge? And how shoulde he that made the eie, lacke the sence of seynge. He that doeth checke whole nations, and teacheth men science: Shoulde not the same rebuke you for such force and violence? The Lorde hath knowen that all the thoughtes of mans herte are but vayne: As are all the inuentions of an inconstante brayne. Happie is the man (O Lorde) whom thou wylt kepe in awe: Right so is he whom thou wylt trayne and enstruct in thy lawe. That thou maist ordeyne rest for him, agaynst the troublouse tyme: Whylse the pyte maye be dygged for, the vngodly mans crime. The Lorde wyl not his owne people, reiect or cast awaye: And such as he hath made his ow ne he wyll not leaue for aye. Tyll he haue restored iudgment, to the rule of iustice. Which all that be of pure herte, shall folowe in theyr guise. Who could haue risen vp for me against the vngodly? Or who could stand wyth me agaynst them that lyue wyckedly? Except the Lord had holpen me, &amp; succoured my nede: My soule (no doubt) should haue dwelled, emonge the dead wyth spede. When I sayde (Lorde) my fote doeth slyp then dydst thou me sustayne And when my thoughtes dyd trouble me, thou confortedste agayne. Lorde, arte thou lyke in any poynte, to men of cruell sawe? That do inuent wayes to oppresse, vnder coloure of lawe? They renne togither agaynst the soule of a man gyltlesse: And do pronownce innocent bloud gyltie of wyckednes. But vnto me the Lorde standeth for a forte and defence: And my God is the strength wherin I put my confidence. And he shall requite them theyr synne, &amp; stroy them vtterly: In theyr malice, the Lord (I saye) our God shall them destroye. The .xcv. Psalme. Come, let vs all reioyce and synge to the Lord that is one. Let vs synge to the suer grownde of our saluation. Let vs preuent him &amp; falle downe before his face wyth prease: Let vs synge vnto him wyth psalmes, and studie him to please. For the Lord is a myghtie God, a rular &amp; a kynge: A myghtie kynge aboue all Goddes that in earth haue rulynge. In whose hand are the most secrete, and darcke dennes of the grownde: And eke the hygh toppes of the hylles, where euer they be fownde. The sea also is his for he dyd it facion and frame: So dyd his hand the continent, that lyeth wythin the same. Come on therfore let vs honour and fall downe in his syght: Let vs knele before our maker, that is the Lorde of myght. For he is our God and we the people of his pasture: And the flocke of his myghtie hand, of whom he taketh cure. If ye wyll hede his voyce this daye, ye shall haue no hard hert. As in the tyme when ye stroue &amp; tempted me in desert. When tyme your fathers tempted me, they dyd me throughly trye. So dyd theyse my worckes also set out before theyr eie. This nation dyd I forbeare wyth payne fourty yeres daye: So that I sayde, they erre in herte and do not knowe my waye. Then sware I to them in the Ire &amp; greate heate of my breste: That they should neuer enter in to dwel wythin my reste. The .xcvj. Psalme. Synge a newe songe vnto the Lord, in faythse ye accorde All ye that dwell vpon the earth, synge this songe to the Lorde. Synge to the Lorde, and prayse his name preach his saluation: Tell his glorie and wondrouse worckes in euerie nation. For greate and myghtie is the Lord, and of much prayse worthy. And to be feared aboue all the goddes that are so hye. For all the goddes of the people, are nothynge of valure: But the Lorde hath made the heauens that are stydfaste and sure. Honour and glorie are present before him in his syght Myght &amp; magnificence are in his sanctuarie pyght. O ye housholdes of nations, ascribe vnto the Lorde. Glorie &amp; powre, I saye ascribe all suche thynges to the Lorde. Ascribe I saye vnto y? Lorde, glorie worthy his name: Brynge sacrifice and enter in, to hys courtes wyth the same. Bowe your selfe to the Lorde in hys most goodly sacrarie: As many as dwell on the earth, feare ye the Lorde on hye. Tell the Heathen, the Lord doeth reygne, the earth shall stande stidie: For he shall minister the lawes wyth right and equitie. Let the heauens be merie and glad, and let the earth reioyce Let the sea and all thynges therin geue out asoundynge voyce. Let the corne field and all that is therin reioyce I saye: Then all the trees of the foreste, let them, synge out for ioye. Let this be done before the Lorde, because he is comeynge: For he cometh to iudge the earth, and trye ech mans doynge. He shall iudge the round worlde I saye in right and equitie: And all the people of the same, he shall rule faythfully. The .xcvij. Psalme. Let the earth and the Ilandes all, reioyce and be merie: For only the Lorde God reigneth, and hath the imperie. About him are cloudes and darcknes, no man can hym beholde. Right and equitie are the stayes that do hys throne vpholde. The fyer of extreme iudgment shall, go out before his face: And shall on eche syde burne hys foes wyth out fauour or grace. His lyghtnynges haue lyghtned the world on eche syde rounde about: Whiche thynge wh? the earth sawe she dyd for sorowe stand in doubt. The hylles molt at the Lordes presence, euen as the wax melteth: At the presence I saye of him, that all the worlde ruleth. The heauens haue declared his iustice manifestly And all peoples haue playnly sene, his honour and glorie. Let all that worshyp Imagies, and in vayne Goddes delyte: Be confounded, ye Goddes, I saye, falle downe in the Lordes syght. Sion heard this and was right glad and Iudes daughters (O Lord) Reioyced for thy iuste iudgementes, and dyd the same record. For thou (O Lord) arte aboue all, that vp? the earth are: Aboue all the Goddes and rulars, thou art exalted far. Hate vice all ye that loue the Lord, for his, who seke goodnes: He doeth kepe and deliuer from, wycked mens cruelnes. To them that be rightwise &amp; iuste, lyght is sowne and doeth sprynge: And vnto men of a sownde herte, groweth vp reioyceynge. Be merie in the Lorde ye that are full of rightuousnes: And reioyce wh? ye be myndfull, of his great holines. The .xcviij. Psalme. Synge a newe songe vnto the Lord, for he hath wonders wrought. By hys holy arme &amp; owne strength health to him selfe he brought. His health and his saluati?, hath he made knowne and sene: He hathe reueyled his iustice, before the heathens eien. He hath had mynd of his mercie, &amp; trueth towards Israell: All the coastes of the earth haue sene, oure goddes saueynge health well. All ye that dwell vpon the earth synge prayses to the Lorde: Breake out in voyce and eke reioyce, &amp; synge in musickes corde. Synge to the Lord vpon the harppe syng Psalmes to your harppynge Make swete noyse wyth trumpettes and shawmes, before the Lorde and kynge. Let the sea and all thynges therin, geue out a sowndyng voyce. Let all that dwell vpon the earth, in lyke maner reioyce. Let the freshe waters clap wyth handes, as pleased wyth the thynge. And let the mountaynes so reioyce, that they sease not to synge. Let this be done before the Lord, because he is comeynge. For he cometh to iudge the earth, and trye ech mans doynge He shall iudge the rownde world I saye in right and equitie: And all the people of the same, he shall rule faythfully. The .xcix. Psalme. Euen when the Lord reigned alone, the people made vprore: Whylse he sate vpon Cherubim, the earth was moued sore. The Lorde is great &amp; myghtie in his owne citie Sion: So is he high and aboue eche people and nation. Let them set forth &amp; celebrate thy name (Lord) worthyly: For it is greate &amp; worthy fear, &amp; eke passynge holye. A Kynge loueth ryghtwise dealynge, but thou preparedst it And in Iacob thou dost the thynge that is boeth iuste and fyt. Exalt I saye exalt the Lord our God that is on hye: And fall downe at his fete for he is sacret and holye. Amonge his priestes was Moses, and hys brother Aaron: And of them that dyd crie on hym, good Samuell was one. They cried to hym and he hearde them, &amp; spake to them agayne: Out of a cloude, &amp; to kepe all his lawes they were ryght fayne. O Lorde our God, thou heardest them, &amp; dydst them not denye: Thou wast to them a loueynge God, plagegeynge theyr vayne studie. Exalt the Lorde our God, and caste your selfe prostrate on grownde: At the hyll of hys holynes, for holye is he fownde. The .C. Psalme. All earthly men synge to the Lorde &amp; worshyp hym gladly: Come merily into his syght, reioyceynge hertily. Acknowledge that the Lord is God, for he is our maker: And not we ours, but hys people and flocke no doubt we are. Enter his gates to geue him thanckes &amp; his courtes to synge prayse: Set him forth wyth prayses and laude his name all maner wayes. For the Lord is right mercifull, &amp; eke right good I saye: His mercie shall neuer haue ende, neither his trueth decaye. The .Cj. Psalme. Mercie and iudgment wyll I synge, of them my songe shall be: Of mercie and iudgment (O Lord) I wyll synge vnto the. I wyll walke wysely in sure waye, tyl thou do come to me: Wythout spotte or blemysh of herte, in myne house wyll I be. I wyll purpose no wyckednes, ne dede worthy of blame: All wycked doars wyll I hate, and put from me the same. The peruerse and the froward herte shall not abyde wyth me: Neither shall the maliciouse, of myne acquayntaunce be. Such as theyr neighbours mysse reporte in secrete, I wyll stroye: I wyll not abyde such one as, wyth proude herte loketh hye. Such wyll I seke to dwell wyth me, as be faythfull in dede: And such as walke innocently, shall serue me at my nede. He shall not dwel wythin myne house that worcketh any gyle: And he that speaketh lyes shall not, dwell wyth me any whyle. All the vngodly of y? earth I wyll destroye quickly: That the wycked doars may be put out of the citie. The .Cij. Psalme. O Lord, heare and graunt my prayer, and do it not denie: And let my greate &amp; lowde cryinge, come vp to the on hye. Hyde not thy face from me (O Lord) but heare me in distresse: And when I call to the for helpe, graunt it wyth redines. For my dayes be wasted lyke smoke, and my bones brentlyke fyre: Myne herte is wythered lyke heye, to eate I ne desyre. My bones and fleshe cleaue togither, through sorowe of myne herte: I am made lyke the pellicane, and howlet of desert. I haue watched and am become, lyke a sparowe alone: Syttyng on the rydge of the house in whom confort is none. I was dayly reuiled of, such as myne enmies were: And they reioyced ouer me, and gan by me to swere. I dyd eate asshes lyke as breade, &amp; blende teares in my cup: For thy greate wrath because to plage me thou dydst lyfte me vp. My dayes are gone lyke a shadowe, and I am dryed lyke haye: But thou Lord shalt continew styll, and be in mynde for aye. Ryse vp (O Lorde) &amp; take mercie, &amp; pitie on Sion. Because the tyme poynted therto, doeth nowe drawe fast vpon. For thy seruantes beare fauour to, the stones of that citie: And to caste out the duste therof, they do desyer greatly. And let the heathen feare the name, of the Lord in lyke case: And all the kynges of the earth the maiestie of his face. For the Lord built Sion and was sene in his maiestie. And regardyng the pores requeste, he dyd it not denie. This thynge shall be lefte in wryttynge, to our posteritie: And people that shall then be borne, shall prayse God certenly. For the Lord loketh from aboue, from his sanctuarie: And he shall loke vpon the earth, out of the heauen hye. That he maye heare the waylynge of menin captiuitie. And deliuer them out of bondes, that are iudged to die. That men maye celebrate and prayse, the Lordes name in Sion: And hys prayse in Ierusalem, hys habitacion. When the peoples and kyngdomes all, shall be brought into one: To honoure and worshyp the Lorde, the Lord I saye, alone. But he hath afflicted and broke, my strenght vpon the waye: And hath cut of and shortened my tyme and fatalle daye. I wyll therfore saye (O my God) take me not at myd age: For thyne yers continue for aye, and shall neuer aswage. For thou dydst fyrste laye the grownde worcke of the earth that is rownde: And the worckes of thyne handes also, the hygh heauens are founde. Which all shall perishe but thou shalt remayne styll vnmoued; All thynges shal wax olde lyke a cote, and be by the chaynged. But thou bydest the same for aye, thyne yeres shall haue none ende: Let the sonnes of thy seruantes byde, and do theyr sede defend. The .ciij. Psalme. My soule preach &amp; declare the Lord, preach and spreade out his fame: And eke my bowelles euerye one preach ye hys holy name. Preach and declare the Lorde, I saye, my soule, and kepe in mynde: The benifites &amp; great goodnes, that in him thou dydst fynde. He forgeueth the all thy fautes, and thyne iniquities: And healeth all thy syknesses and thyne infirmities. From the powre of the destroyer he setteth thy lyfe free: His benifites &amp; mercies all, he heapeth vpon the. With thynges that are dulcet and swete, he doeth aye fyll thy mouth: That lyke as doeth the egle thou mayest recouer thyne youth. The Lorde wyth iustice doeth reuenge, all such as are oppreste: And to deliuer innocentes, he is redie and preste. His lawes and his commaundementes, to Moses dyd he tell: So dyd he to Iacobs chyldren hys studies &amp; counsell. The Lorde is kynd and mercifull, when synnars do hym greue: Longe sufferynge wyth patience, and redie to forgeue. He vseth not to chyde &amp; braule wyth worddes continually: Neither to be styll myndfull of a wr?ge or iniurie. He doeth not vse to handle vs accordynge to our synne: He rewardeth the wickednes that we haue lyued in. For as the space is wondrouse great, twyxt earth and heauen aboue: So is hys goodnes muche more large, to th? that do hym loue. He doeth remoue our synnes from vs and our offences all: As far as is the sunne risynge full distant from his fall. And loke what pitie parentes deare vnto theyr chyldren beare: Lyke pitie doeth the Lorde beare to, all such as do hym feare. For our state and condicion, he knoweth certenly: And that we be nought else but duste, he hath in memorie. He knoweth also that mans tyme is, lyke to the wydderynge haye: Or lyke the fayre floure of the field, that fadeth sone awaye. Whose fayre beautie the stormie wyndes, do vtterly disgrace: And brynge him out of knowledge wyth men that dwell in that place. But yet the goodnes of the Lorde towardes them that do him feare: Shall dure for aye, and his justice, towardes theyr nephewes so deare. Towarde such, I saye, as kepe his hestes and beare in memorie: His lawes and institutions, to do them perfectly. The Lorde hath prepared &amp; set, his throne in heauen so hye: And hys kyngdome ruleth all thynges that are vnder the skye. Ye angelles of the Lorde, preach hym, ye myghtie men I saye: Put the Lordes busines in vre, and to hys worde obey. Preach the Lord, O hys armies all, preach and set hym forth styll: For whylse ye be hys mynisters, ye do performe his wyll. O ye worckes of the Lorde preach hym, throughout his imperie: Preach him my soule, cease not my soule, to preach the Lorde boldly. The .ciiij. Psalme. My soule preach &amp; set forth the Lord, O my Lord God saye I: Thou arte myghtie in noble actes, &amp; clad w? bryght glorye. For my God is clothed wyth lyght, eu? as wyth a garm?t: And hath spredde forth the heauens as, the curten of a tent. He hath builded his parlars in, the waters vp on hye And hath made the cloudes hys charet, and doeth wyth the wynde flye. All such he hath made spirites as, doon his message go: So hath he made his ministers hotte flameynge fyre also. The earth also he hath buylded vpon grownd worcke so sure: That for the perfect worcke therof, it myght euer endure. In lyke maner he hath hyd the depe as wyth a garment: To make the waters stand aboue the hylles was his intent. But they flye and dare not abyde when thou byddest them staye: And at the sowne of thy thunder, they renne hastly awaye. They renne, I saye, ouer the hylles, and eke the valeys wyde. Untyl they come vnto the place, where thou wylt they shall byde. A marcke thou hast set, ouer whych they may not passe certayne: Leste they should ouer flowe the earth and couer it agayne. Then sendest thou forth springynge welles, whose stremes do rore &amp; crie: That they may renne betwene the hylles, that on ech syde are hye. That all the wylde beastes of the field, myght dryncke therof plentie: And that the wylde asses also, myght drynck when they be drye. And that the foules of the ayer, that on the trees do synge: Myght lyue nygh them haueynge fast by, theyr abode and dwellynge. Out of the cloudes (his dwellynge place) he geueth the hylles rayne: Wyth the fruite of hys worckes he doeth fyll the earthfull certayne. He bryngeth forth haye for catell, &amp; grasse for mans tyllage That bread myght sprynge out of the earth mans honger to asswage. And wyne to make mans herte merie, &amp; oyle his face to chere: And bread that maketh the hert stronge, at all tymes of the yere. And the Lordes trees are full of sappe, as Ceders in Libane: Where byrddes brede and storckes make theyr nestes in fyr trees to remayne. To the gotes he hath geuen the hylles to serue for theyr refuge: And to the conies and the hares, the clyffes and rockes so huge. The mone he made, that she myght aye diuide the tyme aright And the sunne knoweth certenly his goynge downe at nyght. It is nyght (Lorde) so sone as thou, doest brynge in the darcknes: And then do all the beastes raynge, that lyue in wyldernes. Euen as the Lions whelppes that do, rore and crye at theyr praye: And that they maye seke for theyr meate, that God prouideth aye. And when the sunne is vp they do get th? selues home certayne: And then they go into theyr dennes and laye them downe agayne. But man taketh his worcke in hand, and doeth him therto dyght And doeth applye his busines, tyll it be almost nyght. O Lorde, howe greate are all thy worckes which thy wisedome hathe made? Thy richesse and possession, do the earth ouerlade. The sea it selfe is wyde and broade, where, of beastes that do crall: The mumbre is excedynge greate, as well of greate as small. There go the shyppes and that greate fyshe, and sea monster I saye: That casteth forth floudes of water, whom thou madeste there to playe. But all these thynges do put theyr trust &amp; confidence in the. That thou wylt geue them theyr fedynge, when theyr due tyme shall be. And when thou geuest, they gather, thynges mete for theyr fedeynges: And when thyne hande is open, they are fylled wyth Good thynges. But if thou hyde thy face from them they are troubled certayne: And if thou take theyr breath, they dye, and turne to duste agayne. Agayne, on the contrarie parte, beastes are create certayne: If thou sende forth thy breath and doest refreshe the earthe agayne. Let the maiestie of the Lord, neuer come to an ende: And let him reioyce in his worckes, which can not be emende. If he behold the earth far of, then doeth it shake for feare. And if he do but tutch the hylles, they smoke vp in the ayer. So longe as I shall lyue therfore, to the Lorde wyll I synge: To my God wyll I synge, I saye, whylse I shall be lyueynge. Ind all my talke concernynge him, shall be dulcet and swete: And I wyll reioyce in the Lorde, as forme it is mete. As for the synnars shall be slayne, and perishe of the grownde: And the vngodly shall no more, remayne for to be founde. My soule preach and set forth the Lord, prayse him wythouten staye: Haleluia, praise the Lorde all faythfull men I saye. The .cv. Psalme. Confesse &amp; acknowledge the Lord, and call vpon hys name: Teach his studies to the people, &amp; make them learne the same. Describe the Lorde and synge to hym, and talke of hys wonders. Reioyse in hys moste holy name, and be hys glad sekears. Let them all haue a merie herte, that seke the Lorde I saye: Seke ye the Lorde and eke hys powre, seke the Lordes face alwaye. Remembre the wonderfull thynges, that by the Lorde are wrought: And eke his signes and the iudgmentes, that his mouth hath forth brought. O sede of Habraham I saye, that worshypt God truly. O chyldren of Iacob, that was chosen most certenly. O ye chyldren of goddes chosen, our Lord and God is he: Whose iudgem?tes are in all the earth, most euident to se. For he is euer myndfull of hys faythfull promises: And of the worde he would haue kept, in thousandes of ages. This dyd he confyrme by promise, to Habraham truly: And by an oth to Isaac, byndynge hym selfe therby. To make this a lawe to Iacob, he set it in sure staye: And to make it a couenaunt, to Israell for aye: And thus he sayde. To the wyl I geue the Cananites landes To make them thyne enheritaunce, I put them in thyne handes. When they therfore were verie fewe and an household full small And were strangers in that c?trey and had no grounde at all. And when they from one nation, to an other dyd flyt: And eke from kyngdome to kyngdome, and dyd in no place sytte. Yet dyd the Lord suffer no man, his people to oppresse: But for theyr sakes he plaged kynges, &amp; put them to distresse. Tuche not (sayde he) myne annoynted, men dedicate to me: Ne hurte any of my prophetes, that preach my veritie. Then caused he a greate famen vpon the earth to rise. And made all maner vitales scant, beyonde all maner syse. And before them he sent a man, for to prepare theyr waye: Iosephe was solde into bondage, and seruitude I saye. They bounde his fete in fetters strong, he was there lyke to dye: Untyll the tyme his cause was knowne, and Goddes worde dyd him trye. Then sent the kyng and toke him out, the rular of that lande: He that had rule of much people, dyd relesse Iosephes bande. And in his house he gaue him rule, ouer boeth greate and smalle: And in all his possessions, he gaue him rule of all. That he myght rule his officers, after hys owne deuise: And that he myght teach the elders, wisedome to make them wise. Then Israell (Iosephes father) downe into Egypt came: And Iacob lyued a straynger, in the contrey of Cham. And the numbre of hys people God dyd encrease greatly: And made them for theyr enimies, to stronge and to myghtie. Then turned he Thegyptians hertes, to hate his people all: That they myght studie by disceyte, to make his seruantes thralle. Then sent he Moses his seruant, a man faythfull in dede: And Aaron whom he had chosen, his busines to spede. These men wrought his wonderfull worckes, emonge his enimies: And his sygnes in the land of Cham before his peoples eies. Then sent he suche a dearckenes that it made all thynges obscure: Yet dyd these men neuer repugne, his worde nor his pleasure. Theyr waters he turned to bloude, and slewe theyr fyshes all: And the earth brought forth frogges that dyd in their kynges closetes crall. And at his commaundment ther came on them all maner flyes: And into all theyr coastes there came lysse far beyonde all syse. And in steade of theyr swete suers, he gaue them stormes of hayle: And in theyr lande there rayned downe, flammynge fier wythout faile. He strake and destroyed theyr vynes, and eke theyr fygge trees all: And all the trees of theyr contreys, wheron those stormes dyd falle. At his commaundement also, there came grassehoppars fell: And many moe caterpyllars, th? any man coulde tell. These dyd deuour and eate vp quite al the grasse of theyr lande: They dyd suffer no maner fruite vpon their grounde to stande. In fyne he slewe al the first borne, of theyr contrey certayne: That is to saye euen the first fruites, of all theyr myght and mayne. Then led he forth his flocke loded wyth syluer and wyth golde: And in theyr kynreddes none was weake, were he neuer so olde. And all Egypt reioyced much, when they gan to departe: For the feare of the Lordes people, had stryke them to the herte. He spred abroade a cloude in steade, of a veyle them to hyde. Ryght so dyd he a flameynge fyre, to shyne in the nyght tyde, And when the people cried to him, he gaue them quayles plentie: And with breade that fell from heau? he dyd them satisfie. And laste of al the greate rocke brake, and waters gan flowe out: Through places that were passynge drye, lyke a riuerfull stoute. For he retayned styll in myde, hys promise moste holy: Made to his seruaunt Abraham, whoe worshipt him trulye. And he led forth his owne people, with ioye and reioyceynge: So dyd he his beloued men, with most ioyful syngynge. And to them he gaue the contreis, of men that were Heathen: That they myght possesse thynges that were by theyr laboure gotten. To the ende that they myght obserue hys lawes and holde hys laye: Wherfore I saye prayse ye the Lorde, prayse ye the Lorde I saye. The .cvi. Psalme. Confesse, confesse vnto the Lorde, for he is good I saye: Confesse to hym for hys mercie, continueth for aye. Who can be able to declare, the stronge worckes of the Lorde? Or to speake of all hys prayses, and the same to recorde? Oh happie are they that do kepe, iudgm?t and therin staye: Right so are they happie that do worcke rightuousnes alwaye. Lord for the loue thou bearest to thy flocke remembre me: And visite me Lorde for the health, that remayneth in the. That I may se thy chosen sorte, lyue in felicitie: And maye reioyce wyth thy people, and with thy stocke glorie. He haue synned as greatly as euer our fathers dyd: We haue done vniustly and haue wrought thynges that are wycked. Thy wonders in Egypt they dyd not weygh and scanne wysly: Ne kept thy greateste benifites, in perfect memorie. And when they came vnto the sea, there were they vnruly At the red sea, I saye, they were rebelles stoute and sturdie. Yet dyd the Lorde preserue them all, for his names sake only That hys strength and hys myghtie powre myght be more knowne therby. And he rebuked the red sea, and forthwyth it was drye: And then he led them through the depe, as through desert saflye. And he saued them pullynge them, out of theyr enmyes powre. And eke from theyr enimies handes, he dyd them deliuer. But the waters ouerwhelmed, theyr enmies in such sorte: That none of them was lefte on lyue, to make therof report. Then gaue they credite to his wordes, &amp; gan his prayse to synge: But streyght waye they forgate his worckes myndynge his lawes nothynge. They burned wyth concupiscence, in the desert doubtlesse: So they tempted and proued God, in the rude wyldernes. And he gaue the thynge that they dyd so ernestly desyre: But wythall he gaue them a plage, for theyr rewarde and hyre. More ouer in theyr tentes they dyd Moses enuie and hate. And so dyd they Aaron that was to the Lord consecrate. Wherfore the earth dyd open hir, &amp; dyd Dathan swalowe: And all Abirase companye, it dyd ouerwallowe. The fyre also burned full hotte in these mens companie: The flameynge fyre that burned vp, men that were vngodly. More ouer they made them a calfe, at Oreb that montayne: And gaue honour to an Image that fyre had molt certayne. So chaunged they the maiestie, of theyr God most myghtie: For an Image of oxe or cowe, that eateth grasse dayly. And they forgate God vtterly, that had them falsly kept: And that had wrought so noble thynges in the land of Egypt. They forgate him I saye, that had, at Cham greate wonders wrought: And fearefull thynges at the, red sea, through which he had them brought. He had decreed to destroye them, tyll Moses his chosen: Had made request in theyr behalfe, and his anger broken. They dyd also forsake the land, that they had desyred: Geueyng no credite to the worde, of him that promised. And in theyr tentes they murmured, and dyd in herte repyne: Neither were they obedient, vnto goddes worde diuine. Then sware he to them that he would, destroye them in deserte: And theyr seede emonge the heathen, and scatter them aparte. Then dyd they ioyne them selues vnto Ball Peor, as theyr heade: And then they eate of thynges offred, vnto goddes that were deade. And by theyr owne studies and wayes, they dyd kendle Goddes Ire: That most cruel destruction, myght be theyr worthy hyre. As when good Phine has stode vp, and thought good to destroye: The shamlesse worckar of his wil, that plage myght cease therby. Which thynge was imputed to him, for iustice right and true: And in lyke maner shall it be, whylse tyme shall continue. At the water of stryfe also, theyr Lorde they prouoked. And for theyr sakes good Moses was, at Goddes hande punished. For they had so vexed his mynde, and eke his pacience: That he spake some thynge wyth his mouth that lacked reuerence. More ouer, they spared such men, as the Lorde bade them stroye: They occupied wyth the Heathen, and learned theyr worckes therby. So that they worshypt theyr Idoles, which were to them a snare: For to deuelles they kylled theyr sonnes, and daugthers wythout care. The gyltlesse bloude of theyr childr?, they shed in sacrifice: To the Chananites Images, in most vngodly wise. And in theyr dedes they were vncleane, &amp; wycked was theyr waye: And in theyr owne intentions, they wandered astraye. And the Lorde was excedynge wrath, wyth his people therfore: And hated his enheritaunce, that had synned so sore. In so much that he gaue them vp, into the heathens handes: And would theyr enimies shoulde rule, boeth them and eke theyr landes. Yea theyr enimies vexed them, and dyd them sore agreue: And caused them magre theyr heade vnder theyr powre to lyue. Sometyme he set them free but they, by theyr wayes that were vayne: Prouoked him, and theyr mysse lyfe, made them styll pore agayne: Yet when he sawe theyr miseries, and hearde theyr dolefull crye. Myndfull of his promes to them, he shewed his greate mercie. He pitied them, I saye, after his plentie of mercies And made them fynde fauour in the syght of theyr enimies, Kepe vs (O Lord that arte our God) and gather thyne elect From emonge the heathen that do, not loue the nor thy secte. Kepe vs, I saye, that we maye styll thyne holy name confesse. And celebrate the wyth prayses, after thy worthines. The Lord God of Israel is, to be praysed for aye Let all the people saye Amen, prayse ye the Lord I saye. The .cvij. Psalme. Confesse, c?fesse vnto the Lord, for he is good I saye: Confesse to him, for his mercie continueth for aye. Let such as y? lord hath made fre, saye nowe vnfaynedly That he hath set them fre from the powre of the enimie. And that he hath gathered them out of all regions: From east, from west, &amp; from the north, and the south nations. And wh? they wandred in desert, through wayes in wyldernes. Wherin they founde no dwellynge place, in theyr nede and destres. And when through great honger and thurste, they faynted in theyr mynde: They cried to hym in theyr dayngers, &amp; dyd hym redie fynd. He dyd deliuer them I saye, and led them the ryght waye: To a towne of inhabitaunce, and gaue it th? for aye. Let them confesse then and ascrybe, to the Lorde his mercies: And eke the miracles that he hath done before mens eies. For he glutteh the hungry soule, &amp; fylleth wyth good thynges: The soule that is lyke to perishe for lacke of norishynges. Such as sate in vtter darckenes, and extreme miserie. Because they dyd wythstand goddes worde, and set nothynge therby. The same he made ryght pensyfe and eke of mynde desperate: That they myght falle and no man shoulde helpe them in that estate. Yet when they cried in theyr dayngers, he pulde them out of payne: He ledde them out of thycke darckenes, and set them fre agayne. Let them confesse them and ascribe to the Lorde hys mercies: And eke the miracles that he hath done before mens eies. For he brake downe the brasen gates, and caste them wydde open: And the greate barres of Iron he hath in sunder broken. The foles that by theyr wycked lyfe, haue gote sycknes plentie. So that theyr soule abhorred meate, &amp; they were lyke to die. Yet when they cryed in theyr dayngers he pulde them out of payne. And his word sent he healed them, and made them cleane agayne. Let them confesse them and ascribe, to the Lorde his mercies And eke the miracles that he, hath wrought before mens eies. And let them offer sacrifice of hertie confessynge: And let them tell forth all hys dedes, wyth most ioyfull syngynge. Such as in shyppes go to the sea, and do theyr busynes there: Haue sene goddes worckes and hys wonders that in the depthe appeare. For his word the stormie wyndes, lyfte vp the waues on hye: Nowe vp to heauen, &amp; then they falle, downe to hell by and by. In these troubles theyr hertes do faile, &amp; they are turned rounde. And wander lyke men that are dr?cke, theyr wyttes are nothynge sownde. These also cried in theyr dayngers, and he brought them from payne: He layd, the storme and eke the waues, and made all caulme agayne. Then they reioyce because God hath brought them to quiete reste: And set th? in such an hauen as lyketh theyr herte beste. Let them confesse then and ascribe, to the Lorde hys mercies: And eke the miracles that he hath wrought before mens eies. And let them extolle him in the companye of people: And prayse hym emonge the elders, when they do assemble. For he turneth the rennynge streames into a deserte grounde: And dryeth vp the water sprynges, where muche water was founde. So doeth he turne che fruitfull grownde, into barante and drye: Because they that do dwell theron, do lyue so vitiousely. And full of water he causeth, the wyldernes to stande: And eke great plentie of welsprynges, where erste was most drye lande. And there he placeth the hongry, and such as lacked foode: To build a noble citie there, and a dwellyng ryght good. And that they myght ther tyll come fieldes, and eke great vinyardes plant: That myght beare fruite in such plentie, that there should be no want. Further he doeth them prospere so, that they encrease greatly: And theyr cattell he saueth so, that none of them do dye. Yet are they minished also, and do somethynge decaye: Sore vexed and oppressed of theyr owne rulars, I saye. For God despyseth the rulars, sometyme, and that greatly: Makynge them wander in desert, through whych no waye doeth lye. But the pore he preserueth aye, out of all miserie: And theyr housholdes he handleth, as they were shepe truly. Which thynges when the good sorte dose, they reioyce and be fayne: And the wycked haue nought to blame, or wherof to complayne. Who so (therfore) is wise, let him kepe these thynges in his mynde: And consyder what benifites he doeth in the Lorde fynde. The. cviij. Psalme. Myne herte is made redie to synge (O God) and eke to playe: On instrumentes melodiouse, O my glorie I saye, My lute and eke myne harppe arise, for I wyll wake erlye: In the mornynge wyth the daye sprynge, my Lorde to magnifie. And vnto the wyll I confesse, throughout all regions: And wyll synge and set forth thy name, emonge all nations. For thy mercie Lord) is so greate, that the heauens it doeth passe: And thy trueth reacheth to the skye, that doeth the earth compasse. Be thou more high then heauen (O God) and let thy maiestie: Be hygher then the earth that is, vnder thyne imperie. And that thyne elect and chosen, maye be deliuered: By thyne owne powre saue vs, and let our request be graunted. Because God hath spoken the worde, wythin his holy place: I wyll wyth ioye diuide Sichem &amp; Sucoths vale by passe. Gilead and eke Manesses are myne, but Ephraim: Is the key of my kyngdome, and Iuda my lawes doeth deme. As for Moah, is my washe pan, on Edomwyll I walke: And ouer Palestine wyll I, synge and pleasantly talke. Who shall leade me into stronge holdes, into townes of defence? Who shall leade me into I dume, full of magnificence? Shalt not thou do it (O my God) whoe dyddest vs forsake: And wouldest not walke wyth our men, wh? we dyd the warres take? O God, helpe thou in all distres, for mans helpe is but vayne: But we shall fyght stoutly through God, by whom our foes are slayne. The .cix. Psalme. O God whom only I do prayse, whose name I magnifie: Holde the not styll, but speake (O Lorde) and shewe thy selfe therby. For the mouth of the wycked man, and the mouth disceythfull: Are open agaynste me, and talke, wyth a tongue right gylefull. And wordes that do sprynge of hatered, haue compassed me rownde: And wythout cause they assault me, &amp; beate me to the grounde. For the loue that I beare to them, they are myne enimies And yet do I praye for them all, in my moste hertie wyse. And for the good I do to th?, they render euell to me: So do they hatered for my loue &amp; my greate charitie. Agaynst suche one (O Lorde) styr vp, the wycked of the lande: And let his aduersarie stande, sty flye at hys ryght hand. When he shal be brought to iudgment, let hym be founde wicked And when he prayeth, let hym then wyth synne be infected. Make hys lyfe dayes fewe and geue hys office to another: Make his children fatherlesse, &amp; an wydowe theyr mother. Let his chyldren wander and begge and seke foed ouer all: When they come out of theyr houses, that are lykely to fall. Let the vsurar bygyle hym, of all he doeth possesse: And the enmie take all that doeth by hys labour encrease. Let ther none chaunce to hym that would take vpon him pitie: Ne that woulde worcke a benifite to hys posteritie. Let his ofsprynge be in daynger, of the destruction: And his name haue an ende in the next generation. Let the Lorde call to memorie, his fathers wyckednes: And not forgette his mothers synne, his plages for to encrease. And let them be styll in the syght, of the Lorde God most hye: That out of all the earth he maye blotte these mens memorie. For this man coulde shewe no mercie, but persecuted styll: The pore abiecte of dolfull herte, hym to murther and kyll. And curssynge he loued which dyd, cha?ce vnto him in dede: But blessynge he forsoke which is, far from him seuered. He put on curssynge as a cote, which into him is gone: As water goeth into the flesh, and oyle into the bone. Let it be his garment therfore, for euer &amp; for aye: And eke the gyrdle wherwyth he maye gyrd himselfe eche daye. These thynges hath the Lord prepared for myne aduersaries. And for suche as speake yl agaynste my soule in any wise. But thou (O my Lord God) be styll wyth me redie and preste. And for thy name deliuer me, for thy mercie is beste. As for me, I am vyle and pore, and myne herte is wounded: I vanishe as a shadowe and, am sharply tormented. My knees do faynte for lacke of foode my fleshe is abated: And nowe my bodies habite, and beautie is altered. I am to them a raylynge stocke, they shake theyr heades at me: Helpe me O Lord my God, and saue me for thy greate mercie. And let them vnderstande &amp; knowe that this greate powre is thyne: And that thou beynge the Lord doeste these thynges by powre diuine. As for them, let them cursse and ban, but do thou blesse agayne: Let them rebell and be shamed, but make thy seruante fayne. Let myne aduersaries put on, ignominie and shame: Let them weare reproch as a cloke, and decke them wyth the same. I wyll confesse vnto the Lorde wyth my mouth plentuousely: I wyll praye and magnifie him in a great companie. For he stode at the pores ryght hand, to saue his soule from them: That boasted them to haue the power, him to saue and condemne. The .cx. Psalme. Thus sayde the Lorde vnto my Lorde, at my ryght h?de syt thou. Tyll I make all thyne enimies, vnder thy fote to bowe. The rodde of thy powre the Lord shal send forth, out of Sion: Ouer thy foes thou shalt therfore, haue the dominion. Thou haste a people moste redie, when thou shalt gyn to raygne: And thy byrth is right noble and eke ryght holy certayne. The Lorde hath sworne that thou shalt be a prieste euerlastynge: As was Melchise dech, &amp; he repenteth him nothynge. The Lorde standeth at thy ryght hande, as a defence myghtie: Whoe beate downe myghtie kynges in the daye when he was angrie. Messias the redemar shall iudge in most vpright wise: The heathen, &amp; then al shal be fylled wyth deade bodies. He shall I saye iudge the heathen, when he shall the heades breake: In many regions and shall, his wrath vpon them wreake. He shall dryncke of the swyfte riuer that renneth in the waye: And for that cause he shall lyfte vp, his heade on high I saye. The .cxj. Psalme. Wyth herte and mynde I wyll confesse vnto the Lorde of myght. In the counsell and companie, of men that are vpryght. For the worckes of the Lorde are greate, and wonderfull in syght: Which are sought of as manye as do in the same delyght. His worckes are glorie and honoure, he is praysed therby. And his iustice doeth styl remayne, and byde eternally. His miracles and wonders he, hath lefte in memorie. He is a Lorde so bountuouse, and full of all mercie: To such as feared him he gaue, meate prepared by praye: And hath in mynde his couenaunte, and his promesse for aye. The powre of his owne worckes he dyd, to his people aduaunce: In that he gaue them the heathen, for theyr enheritaunce. And the worckes of his handes are trueth and eke iudgment vpright: And all his constitutions, are firme &amp; surely pyght. Yea they are establyshed that, they maye continue aye. In trueth and eke in ryght iudgment, they are all done I saye. He sent such men to his people, as should them deliuer. And bade them that his couenaunt, shoulde be kept foreuer. The Lord, I saye, hath geu? this charge, vnto his owne people: Whose name no doubt, is most holy, and eke most terrible. Goddes feare is the rote of wisedome, and such as therin staye: Do attayne to holesome knowledge and are praysed for aye. The .cxij. Psalme. The man is blessed that doeth feare the Lorde and doeth delyght: In hys holy commaundementes, to walke therin vpright. For his sede shall be founde myghtie, in the earth euerie where And the nation of the good, shall luckyly prospere. Greate plentie of goodes and riches shall in his house remayue: And his iustice shall continue for euer more certayne. Lyght doeth arise vnto good men, when they syt in darcknes. To the bountuouse, &amp; mercifull, that folowe ryghtuousenes. The good man heapeth benifites, and lendeth plentuousely. And doeth all hys owne busines, excedynge equally. For he shall neuer be moued, tyll tyme of tymes be paste: And for euer hys rightuousnes, &amp; hys iustice shall laste. And when he heareth heauy newes, feare shall hym nothynge prycke: Because his herte is stablished, and doeth to the Lorde stycke. His herte, I saye, is stablished, so that he can not feare: Tyll vpon all hys enimies, hys wyshes do appeare. He geueth to the pore ech where, his iustice shall byde aye: His powre shal be set vp on hyghe with great glorie I saye. That seynge thys the wycked may, be wrath and gnashe his teethe: And eke consume hym selfe and get nought that he desyrethe. The .cxiij. Psalme. O ye that do honour the Lord, prayse ye his name I saye For hys name is to be preached, nowe and hense forth for aye. From the vpriseynge of the sunne, to the place of hys falle: The holy name of the Lorde is of prayse worthyest of all. For the Lorde is hygher then are all nations truly: And so is he higher then the, heauen that is so hye. Who is lyke vnto our Lorde God, that ruleth thynges on hye: And yet loketh on thynges in heauen, and that on the earth do lye? He lyfteth vp the weake out of the duste to stand vpright: And eke the pore out of the dounge, he bryngeth by hys myght. And that to the entent he myght, hym emonge princes place: Emonge princes of his people, I saye, to geue hym grace. He maketh the wyfe of the housse, that was barren before: A ioyfull mother of chyldren, prayse ye the Lorde therfore. The .cxiiij. Psalme. When Israell shoulde go forth of Egypt from seruitude: And Iacobs house from a people, boeth Barbarouse and rude. Then was Iuda cert?ly made, the lordes sanctuarie: And in lyke maner Israell was made hys Imperie. The whych thynge when the sea had sene it fled backward certayne: And the great riuer Iordayne was returned backe agayne. As for the mountaynes ceased not, lyke wanton rammes to skyppe: And the little hylles gan to playe, as do the lambes of shype. O thou sea, what is the bytyd, that thou goest backe agayne: And thou I ordayne what thynge is it, that doeth thy course restrayne? And ye mountaynes what causeth you, lyke wanton rammes to shyn: And you little hylles for to playe, as do the lambes of shype? And thou earth se thou quake also, in the lordes feare alwaye: Se that thou tremble in the feare of Iacobs God I saye. For he maketh a standynge pole of the rocke that was drye: And of the flynt a spryngynge well, rennyng out plentuousely. The .cxv. Psalme. For thy mercie Lord and thy trueth vouchsafe to amplifie: The glorie of thy blessed name, &amp; not our vayne glorie. For whye should the Heathen saye thus, wyth a disdayne full mynde? I praye you where or in what place, should we these mens God fynde? Whye should they speake such wordes I saye, wyth thoughtes excedyng isle? Syth our God is in heauen and doeth all thynges that he wyll? But these mens Images are made, of gould and syluer vayne: And are the vayne worckes of mans hande, fruites of an idle brayne. For they haue a mouth and speake not, &amp; eies that do not se: So haue they eares and do not heare, such worthy thynges they be. They haue a nose and do not smelle, and handes that do not fele: So haue they fete &amp; do not walke, neyther once moue theyr hele. And wyth theyr throte they do brynge forth no maner voyce at all: And for helpe in theyr daynger they, can neither crye nor calle. Lyke vnto whome such shall be made, as do make them certayne: And so shall all that put theyr truste, in thynges that are so vayne. O Israell, trust in the Lorde, O faythfull men I saye: Truste in the Lorde that is your helpe, and your bucklar for aye. O ye that be of Aharons house, and the hygh priestes kynne: Truste in the Lord that is your helpe, and targate to truste in. All ye that feare the Lorde, I saye, haue in him confidence: For he it is that is your helpe, and targate of defence. The Lorde that maketh the houshold of Israell happy. And eke the houshold of Aharon, hath vs in memorie. And he maketh all that feare him, happie and fortunate Aswell such as are verie smalle, as y? myghtie and greate. He shall also heape vnto you, good turne vpon good turne. Not only vnto you I saye, but eke to your chyldren. And you he hath alredie made, happy &amp; fortunate: Euen he, I saye, that dyd the heauen &amp; eke the earth create. And the heauen is reserued, for the Lord God alone But the earth he hath geuen to men, for th? to dwell vpon. As for the dead they prayse not God, they do no mercie craue: No more doeth any emonge them that go downe to the graue. But we shall preach and set forth God fr? henseforth euer more: We shal declare his myghtie worckes, prayse ye the Lorde therfore. The .cxvj. Psalme. I loue the Lord because he heard myne humble voyce and crie: And because he gaue eare I wyll, calle on him tyll I dye. The cordes of death had gyrded me, &amp; eke the straytes of hell: Had caught me and I was fallen into daynger cruell. But I called on the Lordes name &amp; thus I sayde in dede: Lorde for thy mercie delyuer, thy seruantes soule at nede. The Lorde is full of benifites, and eke of iustice all: And our God is right mercifull, when we do on him call. The Lorde that vseth to defende, the sylley simple sorte: Preserued me when I was weake, and was all my consorte. My soule, returne into the place, of thy quiete and reste: For the Lorde hath done good to the. euen as thou desyreste. Thou hast plucked my soule from death, Lorde, and his cruell stynge: So haste thou done myne eyes from teares, and my fete from slydynge. Wherfore I wyll lyue holyly, before the Lorde I saye: In the contreys and regions of men that lyue for aye. My fayth and promise vnto God, I helde most constantly Euen when I was forced to saye, I am decayed greatly. Yea when I sayd in my swyfte chase, and when I fled in haste: All men are false, ther is none true, or that of trueth doeth taste. What worthy thanckes therfore shall I, geue to the Lorde saye ye: For all the benifites that he, hath shewed vnto me? The cup wherwyth men vse to geue thanckes for health receyued: The same wyll I take &amp; call on the Lordes name so blessed. And nowe before all his people, to the Lord wyll I paye: All vowes that I haue made to him, or else shall make for aye. For wyth the Lorde the death of suche, as serue hym loue yngely: Is of such price that none of them, shal suffer death vaynely. Ah Lorde I am thy pore seruant, thy pore seruant am I: And the sonne of thyne handmayden whoe dydeste my bondes vntie. To the therfore I wyll confesse, and that wyth sacrifice: And wyll call vpon the Lordes name in my most faythfull wise Nowe before all the Lordes people, all my vowes wyll I paye: In his courtes at Ierusalem, prayse ye the Lorde I saye. The .cxvij. Psalme. All nations prayse ye the Lorde, prayse and extolle his name: All people of the worlde preach him let your lyfe do the same. For his mercie towardes vs I saye, doeth excell euer more: And his trueth abydeth for aye, praise ye the Lorde therfore. The .cxviij. Psalme. Confesse, confesse vnto the Lorde, for he is good I saye: Confesse to hym for hys mercie, continueth for aye. Nowe let Israell saye that his mercie dureth for aye: And let Ahar?s house saye that his goodnes doeth not decay. Yea let all them that feare the Lorde, eu? nowe stand forth and saye: That his moste mercifull goodnes, c?tinueth for aye. When I was in affliction, on God then called I: And he graunted all my requeste, and that aboundauntly. Wherfore the Lorde takynge my parte, I wyll not stand in feare: Of anythyng that mans wytte can inuent to do me deare. For when the Lorde is one of them, that cometh to helpe me: Then shall I se all my desyre vpon myne enimie. For it is better to trust in the Lorde then in man vayne. So is it to truste in the Lorde then in princes certayne. If all nations dyd hedge me, in compasse rownde about: Yet do I trust by the Lordes name, to cutte me a waye out. If they should compasse me aboute, I say, and hedge me in: I do not doubt, by the Lordes name, awaye out for to wynne. And though they compasse me about, lyke bees when they do swarme: Yet shall they faynt lyke fyre in thornes, and do me little harme. And I truste that through the Lordes name, wheron I do styll call: I shall cutte a waye out and set myselfe fre from them all. Oh thou that waste myne enimie, thou madest me fall certayne: But yet the Lorde hath holpen me, and set me vp agayne. For God it is that is my strength, my salfgard and my wealthe: So is he my reioyceynge songe, &amp; eke myne only health. In the dwellynges of the ryghtuouse are ioyfull reioyceynges: For theyr health receyued when the Lordes powre hath done greate thynges. The Lordes ryght hand gate the better, the Lordes power dyd great thynges: I shall not dye but lyue &amp; shewe forth goddes myghtie doynges. For God hath chastened me wel, &amp; brought my stoute herte lowe: But yet he hath not suffered, that I shoulde dye I knowe. Oh open vnto me the gates, of rightuousnes that I: Maye enter in ther at (I saye) by the lordes free mercie. For other wyse none can enter by any holines: When I am entred in therfore, to God wyll I confesse. This gate (I saye) of fre mercie, is the lordes gate therfore. In at the which the rightuouse men, shal enter euer more. To the therfore (O Lorde) I wyll, confesse wyth herte and mynde: Because thou haste hearde me and I, doin the myne health fynde, For the stone that buildars caste out, is made the heade corner: which thynge no doubt the Lord hath done, and we compt it wonder. That daye therfore is it that the Lorde hath made at his wyll: Let vs therfore in it reioyce, and be gladde in hert styll. Ah Lorde kepe me, I the beseche, Ah Lord I besech the: Geue thou a prosperouse successe, and good fortune to me. To him that cometh in the Lordes name we wyshe all good thynge. And luckye thynges to you that are, in hys house abydynge. God is the Lorde that bryngeth vs, lyght of prosperitie: Wherfore to the aultare couers, do ye sacrifice tye. Thou arte my God, and vnto the, wyll I confesse alwaye: And the wyll I extolle, for thou arte my lorde God I saye. Confesse, confesse vnto the Lorde, for he is good I saye: Confesse to him for his mercie continueth for aye. The .cxix. Psalme. I. O happie are they that do kepe, of lyfe the vpright waye: And that walke in the prescript path of the Lordes lawe I saye. O happie are they that do kepe, all the Lordes wytnesses And do seke him wyth all the herte that is in theyr brestes For such as walke (Lorde) in thy waies, do nothynge wyckedly. For thou badeste that men should kepe thy lawes diligently. Oh that my wayes were guided so, to kepe thy lawes aright: That I were not ashamed to haue thy preceptes in syght. And vnto the wyl I confesse, and that vnfaynedly: When I shall learne the iudgmentes of thy iustice perfectly. And if thou do not forsake me, but helpe thy seruant styll: Wyth erneste studie shal I kepe, thy decrees and thy wyll. ij. If Howe should a yonge man lead his lyfe wythouten spotte or blame: Namely if he should kepe it as thy worde teacheth the same. But seynge that I do seke the, wyth all my verie herte: O Lorde do thou not suffer me, from thy preceptes to sterte. And seynge that I haue layed vp thy worde wythin my breste: To the entent I would not do, ought that thou forbyddest. O Lorde thou oughtest for to haue thy prayse preached I saye: Teach me thy decrees and thy lawes, thy path Lorde and thy waye. For all the iudgmentes of thy mouth, I do vse to reherse: And thy waye doeth delyte me more, then all worldly riches. And of thy constitutions and lawes I do reasone: So do I inwardly beholde, thy pathes at eche season. In thyne holy decrees also, my delyte do I set: And wyll neuer by negligence, thyne holy worde forget. iij. Shewe thou this benifite to me, thy seruant that I maye: Lyue and kepe thy most holy worde, and my lyfe therin staye. And from myne eies drawe thou the veyle that I maye once espie: The wonderfull wisedome that lyeth in thy lawe secretely. And when I am in a strange lande, hyde not from me thy wyll: For my soule doeth wonderfully, desyre thy iudgmentes styll. But thou rebukest the proude that they be execrable: Strayeynge from thy preceptes in wayes most abhominable. Remoue from me all rebuke Lorde, and right so all despyte: Because to kepe all thy wyttnes, is myne only delyte. For the verie princes consulte, and speake euell agaynst me: Because I reasone of such thynges, as in thy decrees be. And because that thy wyttenesses are myne only delyte: And eke myne only consellours boeth by daye and by nyght. iiij. When my soule lyeth vp? the gro?de and is had in disdayne: Then accordynge to thy promise, refreshe thou it agayne. I haue told the my busines, &amp; thou gauest eare to me: Wherfore to teach me thy decrees, I h?bly besech the. Graunte me to knowe the waye of thy lawes and thyne ordinaunce: And then to talke of thy w?ders, I wyl take nogrenaunce. For feare when I was left alone, my soule is much wasted: Refreshe thou me agayne therfore, as thou haste promised. Turne thou from me the waye of lyes, inuented by mans brayne: And wyth mercie set before me, thy lawe that is certayne. For I haue chose the certayne waye, and haue therin delyght: And right so haue I thy iudgmentes euer before my syght. And syth I stycke to thy wyttnes, and fle the waye of blame: O Lorde put not thy pore seruant, to vilanie or shame. And after thou hast set myne herte, at large in libertie: In the highe waye of thy preceptes, I wyll renne lustily. v. Leade me forth (Lord) into the waye, of thy decrees and wyll: That I may walke forth in y? same durynge my lyfe dayes styll. Teach me to kepe thy lawe and I, shall kepe it wyllyngly. Leade me the path of thy preceptes, for theri delyte I. Bowe downe myne herte vnto thy wyll, &amp; not to auarise: And from all vayne and Idle thynges lorde turne awaye myne eies. Lorde make me lyuely in thy waye, and graunte the thynge to me: That thy worde promiseth to them, that st?d in feare of the. And put from me rebuke, the feare wherof chaungeth my moode: For thy iudgmentes Lord are vpright &amp; also passynge good. Beholde thy constitutions, I do desyer greatly: By thy iustice do thou therfore, make thy seruant lyuely. vj. Let thy gyftes and thy benifites, chaunce vnto me, (O Lorde: And eke thyne owne saluation, as thy worde doeth recorde. That I maye haue wordes to answere such as do on me rayle: And tell them that I trust thy worde, which doeth me neuer faile. And from my mouth take not the worde of trueth, for I tarie: For thy iudgmentes, and wyll obserue, thy lawes eternally. And I wyll walke at libertie, and stand in feare of nought: Because thy constitutions, I haue busily sought. And I wyll speake of thy wyttnes, in the presence of kynges. And wyll not be ashamed of so good and godly thynges. And in thy preceptes which I loue, I do my selfe delyte: I loue to haue thyne holy lawes styll pres?t in my syght. And to thy preceptes which I loue, Lord wyll put myne hande: And wyll dispute of thy decrees, and eke in thy trueth stande. vij. Be myndfull of the worde that thou spakeste to they seruant: Wherwyth thou broughtest me in hope as by a sure warrant. For this is myne only solace, in all my miseries: That thy worde doeth me recreate, in c?fortable wise. And when the proude laugh me to skorne, and that excedyngly: Yet do not I turne fr? thy lawe, but walke therin dulie. And when I call to memorie, the mercies by the wrought: From the begynnynge of the worlde, they do conforte my thought. But when I thyncke on the wicked that do thy lawe forsake: Suche soden feare falleth on me, that I tremble and quake. As for me wh? I am at home in my house where I dwell: My delyte is to synge thy lawes, and thy decrees to tell. And in the nyght I am myndfull, Lorde of thy blessed name: And do endeuoure for to walke, in thy lawe wythout blame. Whyche lawe is nowe become my lawe, and waye wherin to go: Because I kepe thyne ordinaunce, both in weale and in wooe. viij. O Lorde thus sayde I wythout fayle I sayde for a suretie: That to kepe thy most holy worde, is my bounden duitie. Wyth all humilitie of herte, I do thy face beholde: Wherefore be mercifull to me, as thy worde hath me tolde. My wayes I haue consydered, and that diligently: And haue brought my fete backe agayne, thy wyttnes to applye. I haue hasted wythout delaye, or slowthfull tariaunce: That I myght kepe all thy preceptes, wyth faythfull obeysaunce. The cordes of the wycked haue gone about to drawe me backe: But the rem?braunce of thy lawe, my mynde dyd neuer lacke. In the mydest of the nyght I dyd arise for to confesse: To the because of the iudgmentes (Lorde) of thy rightuousnes. And I am a companion, to al that do feare the. And kepe the constitutions, that thou (Lord) doeste decre. And let myne herte be pure and cleane in thyne holy decrees: Kepe myne herte cleane and I shal not take shame in any wyse. xj. My soule faynteth whylse doubtfully it doeth desyre thyne health. For in thy worde haue I my truste and confidence of wealthe. Myne eies haue fayled whylse I loke thy promise for tose: In so much that I maye well saye, when wilt thou confort me? For I am nowe lyke a bottel, that in smoke hath hanged. Yet thy decrees and eke thy lawes, I haue styll remembred. Howe longe Lord shall thy seruant wayte, howe longe shall he tarie? When wylt thou punishe them that do vex me so cruelly? The proude haue dygged me trenches, &amp; caues to fall into Wherin agaynste thyne holy lawe and thy decrees they do. All thy preceptes are fayth and truethe, none can thys thynge deny: Helpe me therfore at such tyme as, they vex me vniustly. They had welmost destroyed me, in the lande where I dwell: Yet I forsoke none of thy lawes, as thou knowest full well. Lord for thy mercie quicken me, &amp; make me be lyuely: And then the wytnes of thy mouth I shall kepe certenly. xij. Thy worde standeth Lord in heauen, for euer and for aye: And thy promise thorowe all tyme, who makeste the earth staye. And those thynges abyde to thys daye, at thy commaundement: For ther is nothynge that is not to the obedient. And except (Lord) thy lawe had ben, my delyte and pleasure: In my distres and miserie, I had perished sure. Neither wyll I euer forget, thy constitutions: Syth by them thou dyddeste confort my lamentations. And seynge that I am thyne owne, to kepe me take thou thought: For all thy constitutions, I haue ernestly sought. The wycked men laye wayte for me, that they maye me destroy When to weygh thy testimonies, I do my selfe employ. I se that al thynges haue an ende, though they be most perfect: But thy preceptes we se to be, most largely abroade set, xiij. Oh Lorde howe excedyng great loue vnto thy lawe be are I? Syth my communication, is of the same dayly. By thy precept thou haste made me, more wise then myne enmies For that is styll all my studie, and eke myne exercise. I am also wiser them they, that do thy seruant teache: And about thy testimonies, I do spend al my speache. I do perpende and weygh all thynges, better then men of age: Because thy constitutions, I kepe wythout? rage. My fete I do kepe backe from all, wayes that do leade to vice: Because I kepe thyne holy worde, in my most faythfull wise. I do not parte from thy iudgmentes, ne go from them astraye: Because thou haste prescribed me a rule and perfect waye. Oh howe swete is thyne holy worde to my taste and iudgment? Certes there is no swete hony can my mouth so content Out of thy constitutions, I do weyghe thynges iustly: And haue therfore hated eche waye, that dealeth not truly. xiiij. Thy worde is a burnynge candle, vnto thy seruantes fete. So is it a lyght to my waye, my pathe is lyght by it. I haue sworne and wyll constantly, do &amp; performe the same: That I maye kepe the iudgmentes of thy iustice wythout blame. I am deiect excedyngly, and cast downe to the grownde: Wherfore do thou refresh me lord, as thy promise doeth sownde. Accept thou such oblations Lorde as I frely name: And enstruct me in thy iudgmentes, and make me learne the same. I am styll in daynger of death, my lyfe is sore beset: Yet do I not thyne holye lawe at any tyme forget. The wycked and vngodly men, haue bent a snare for me: Yet from thy constitutions, I swarue in no degre. Thy wyttnesses are vnto me enherita?ce for aye: For they are the ioye of myne hert, my c?fort and my staye. I am addict to thy decrees, my mynd to them I bende. That I maye execute the same for euer to the ende. xv. I hate the thoughtes wherby my mynde is drawne awaye frome the: But thy lawe and commaundementes are beloued of me. Thou arte my succoure and refuge, my shylde and my target. And in thyne holy worde myne hope, is pygh &amp; surly set. Departe from me ye wycked men, kepe me no companie: For I kepe the commandementes of my God ernestly. Underset me wyth thy worde Lorde, and I shall lyue certayne And make me not ashamed &amp; to haue hoped in vayne. Establish me (O Lorde) and then, shall I be false in dede: And shal by the syght of thy lawes be alwaye belited. Thou wylt spurne at all such as go, from thy decrees astraye: For theyr wyles and theyr subtiltie is founde disceyte alwaye. All the wicked men of the earth, lyke drosse thou doeste destroye: Wherfore I loue thy wyttnesses, and thy testimonie. For feare of the my bodie doethe, tremble excedyngly. And thy iudgmentes thy seruant doeth feare moste reuerently. xvi. I haue done iudgment and iustice, I haue done no man wronge. Geue me not vp therfore to myne oppressers that are stronge. Delyte thy seruant wyth good thynges let him lacke no goodnes And suffer not such as are proude, me to greue and oppresse. Myne eies haue fayled whylse I loke, for thyne health doubtfully. And for thy rightuouse promise that thou madeste certenly. Accordynge to thy greate goodnes, Lorde deale wyth thy seruant: And enstruct me in thy decrees, and eke thy conuenaunte. I am thy pore seruaunt I saye, wherfore enstructe thou me: To vnderstande all such thynges as, in thy wyttnesses be. And nowe is it a mete tyme for the Lorde to worcke his feate: For they haue broken thy lawe Lorde, and do thy wyll forgete. Wherefore I haue loued thy lawe, &amp; thy preceptes eche one: More then I haue loued fyne goulde, or most preciouse stone. And for this cause I do defende, all thy lawes as most ryght: But all disceytfull wayes I hate, and owe them moste dispight. xvij. Because thy lawes and wyttnesses, are wonderfull to me: Therfore, I saye, my soule hath kept them in simplicitie. The verie entraunce of thy wordes, and the firste openynge: Bryngeth lyght and enstructeth the simples vnderstandynge. And for this cause do I open, my mouth &amp; my breath drawe: Because I do greatly desyre the preceptes of thy lawe. Loke backe to thy seruant and deale wyth me mercifully: As thou arte wont wyth them that loue, thy name vnfaynedly. Forme thou my steppes Lorde wyth thy worde, let them therwyth agree: And let no maner of vayne thynge, haue the rule ouer me. O Lorde redeme thou me from al humane oppressions: That I maye kepe thyne holy lawes, and constitutions. And shewe thy chereful countena?ce vnto thy pore seruant: And teach me thy decrees and eke, thy holy couenaunt. Greate streames of water do descend, downe from thy seruauntes eies: For theyr sakes that kepe not thy lawes, nor thy testimonies. xviij. Lorde thou arte iuste &amp; thy iudgm?t is streight before our eies: And thou hast geuen strayght charge to kepe all thy testimonies. My wrath and indignation, doeth me deadly greauaunce: Because myne enimies haue not, thy wordes in remembraunce. Thy worde (Lorde) is a thynge moste pure and purged of all fylth: And it is the onely thynge that, thy pore seruant louethe. I am in dede but verie base, and also despised: Yet do I not forget the thynges, that thou haste ordeined. Thy iustice is such a iustice, that it doeth styll endure: And thy lawe is the veritie, most sincere and most pure. Greate daynger and greate miserie, haue me deprehended: Yet wyth thyne holy preceptes Lorde I am styll delited. The iustice of thy wyttnesses, is eternall I saye: Teache me therfore that I maye lyue, for euer and for aye. Because I crye with all myne herte, Lord graunt thou my requeste: That I maye well obserue and kepe, all that thou decreeste. xix. Because I crye to the I saye, do thou saue me at nede: That I maye well obserue all thy, testimonies in dede. The dawnynge and the breake of daye, I do preuent and crie: And in thy worde and sure promise, a faythfull truste haue I. Myne eies do preuent the vigilles and makynge tyme of nyght. That of thyne holye worde I maye dispute some what aright. Heare thou my voyce (O Lorde) I saye, euen for thy mercie sake. And accordynge to thy iudgment, do thou me lustie make. Suche men as folowe wyckednes, nygh vnto me do drawe: Suche men (I saye) as nowe are gone, a greate waye from thy lawe. But thou also (Lorde) arte at hande, wyth me prest and redie: And all thyne holy preceptes are, moste sincere veritie. Whych thynge I knewe by thy wyttenes longe tyme before thys daye: For thy testimonies haue bene for euer and for aye. xx. Loke backe vpon my miserie, and set thy seruant free: For I haue not yet forgotten, the lawe thou gaueste me. Pleade thou my cause and let me be, by the deliuered: And offer me thy worde that I maye be recreated. Thyne health is far fr? the wycked, they shall not it enioye: Because to seke out thy decrees, none of th? doeth employe. Thy mercie (Lord) is manifolde, to it thou arte styll bent: Wherfore refreshe thy pore seruant, after thyne owne iudgment. I haue erred as doeth a shepe, that goeth head longe to dye: But seke thou me because I haue thy lawes in memorie. The .cxx. Psalme. In my greate perile and daynger, to the Lorde dyd I crye: And he gaue eare &amp; eke graunted my requeste by and by. O Lorde deliuer thou my soule, fr? lyppes that vse to lye: And eke from a disceytful tonge, which cause the soule to dye. O thou disceytfull tonge I saye, what can be lyke to the? Or what thynge maye God to the adde, whereby thou mayste worse be? Thou arte lyke vnto the arrowes, that from a stronge man flee: And also lyke the burnynge coles of the Iuniper tree. Woes me that I am a straynger, emonge men of Nesech: And that I dwell in Cedars tentes, lyke a miser and wreche. My soule hath lyued longe emonge men that hate quietnes For when I that loue peace do speake, to warres they do them dresse. The .cxxj. Psalme. Myne eies lyfte I vp to the hylles, to God that is on hye: For thens my confort and my hope, and only helpe haue I. Myne only helpe cometh to me, downe from the Lorde aboue: From him I saye that made heauen &amp; earth that doeth not moue. When the Lord taketh charge of the, thou shall treade stydfastly: And thy kepar shal not desyre to slepe or close his eie. For lo, he is nothynge slepy, neither shall slepe at all. That hath Israel in kepynge, as rular ouer all. It is the Lorde that kepeth the, and shadoweth the from ille: It is the Lord that is present euen at thy right hande styll. The sunne therfore shal not stryke the, by daye wyth his beames bright: No more shall the contagiouse mone, in the tyme of the nyght. The Lorde shal kepe the salfe and sownde, none euell shall come the nye: And he shall kepe thy lyfe also, thy soule shall neuer die. The Lorde shall kepe the salfe I saye and be thy defender: In all thynges that thou goest aboute, from hense forth for euer. The .cxxij. Psalme. When men saye in this wise to me, go we to the Lordes house: Then am I made right glad I say and excedynge ioyouse. In thy gates (O Ierusalem) in thy gates so goodly: Oure fete haue stand and there haue we, bene a great companie. Ierusalem was firste builded, for to be a citie: And a place where men myght be knyt, in a societie. Up to the whych kynreddes do go that of goddes stocke are founde: To confesse him out of the lawe wherwyth Iacob is bounde. For there are seates of right iudgment &amp; iustice appoynted: That is to saye the seate of the house &amp; stocke of Dauid. Oh wyshe you to Ierusalem, peace and prosperitie: And that all maye go well wyth them that do loue that citie. Peace be wythin thyne vtter walles and eke prosperitie: In all thy goodly palaices wherin thy princes lye. For my brethren and my frendes sake, I wyll speake all suche thynge: As vnto thy felicitie, and wealth is belongynge. And for the loue of the house of the Lorde our God I saye: Thynges profitable vnto the, I wyll seke for alway. The .cxxiij. Psalme. Oh thou that dwellest in heauens, and arte there styll present: To the do I lyfte vp myne eies, my mynde to the is bent. Lo as the seruantes eyes are fyxte vpon theyr maisters hande: So do we loke on our Lord God, &amp; do before him stande. And as the handmaydes eyes behold the hande of hir mestres. So are our eies turned to him, tyll we fele his goodnes. Deale mercifully wyth vs Lorde, deale thou mercifully: For wyth contempt we are fylled, and that in great plentie. Longe tyme nowe hath our soule ben full, of the rych mens mockynge: So hath it ben longe satisfied, wyth proude euens despysynge. The .cxxiiij. Psalme. Nowe maye Israell salfly saye, we had all dyed in dede: Had not the lord that is redye with vs holpen at nede. Excepte the lord had holpen vs, when m? agaynst vs rose: In theyr Ire they had eaten vs, alyue as I suppose. By this tyme they had drowned vs, as waters that do slowe: And as a swyfte streme they had gone, quite ouer our heades nowe. By thys tyme, I saye, the waters, that swell excedyngly. Had ouercome oursyly soule, and caused vs to dye. We muste preach and set forth the Lorde, we most prayse him I saye: That hath not geuen vs to theyr teeth, that we should be theyr praye. For our soule hath scaped theyr snare, and is nowe at large set Euen as the sparowe that breaketh out of the foulars net. The net is broken nowe I saye, &amp; we are escaped: Our helpe therfore is in his name, that hath all thynges formed. The .cxxv. Psalme. All such as do truste in the Lorde, shall neuer be moued. More then the holy hyll Sion, that is surly founded. And as aboute Ierusal?, are hyghe hylles on eche syde So shall the Lorde compasse hys floke from hense forth at eche tyde. For the parte of wyckednes shall not wyth the iuste remayne: Leste from doynge iniquitie, theyr handes shoulde not refrayne. O Lord do thou good vnto them, in whom thou doest good fynde And to all suche as thou knowest to be of a good mynde. And let suche as do wyckedlye, haue the wyckedes rewarde At the Lordes hande, that Israel maye lyue nowe in salfegarde. The .cxxvj. Psalme. When the Lorde shall restore Sion, out of bondage agayne: Th? shal we be lyke men y? dreame that they haue lyued in payne. Our mouth and tonge shall be full wyth laughter and syngynge then And the Heathen shall saye the Lorde, hath done much for these men. The Lorde (no doubt) hath done wyth vs, thynges that are greate in dede: And we are made merie therby, and greatly conforted. Oh Lorde, leade thou vs home agayne, out of captiuitie: Euen as thou causeste the riuers of the south parte to drye. Let them that sowe theyr seede wyth teares, and water of thyre eies: Reioyce when they shall reape the same, in moste plentifull wise. The man that beareth the seedlepe, shall go on styll wepynge: But when he shall carie the sheaues, he shal returne syngynge. The .cxxvij. Psalme. Vnlesse the Lorde do builde the house, y? buildars lose theyr payne: And except he kepe the citie, the kepars watch in vayne. It is in vayne that you do rise, so sone and reste so late: And that you get your vitayles wyth payn and sorowes so greate. Syth in the meane ceasone God doeth graunte slepe and quiete reste: To his dearlynges and all such men, as his herte lyketh beste. Beholde the byrthryght of the Lorde, is chylder and younge frye: And the wages that he geueth, the fruite of the bealye. The chyldren that be borne in youth, whylse boeth parentes be yonge: Are lyke the arrowes that are shotte, by a man that is stronge. And happie is he that fylleth his quiuer wyth the same: For when they shal stryue wyth theyre lyke, they shall sustayne no shame. The .cxxviij. Psalme. Happye and blessed is that man, that feareth God aryght: And walketh forward in his wayes, w? all his mayne &amp; myght. Thynges gotten wyth his labour he shall eate of at his nede: He shal be blessed &amp; shal lyue, moste welthyly in dede. In his house sydes his wyfe shall be as a vyne most fruitfull: And his sonnes lyke Olyue branches rownd aboute his table. For lo, in this sorte is the man made blessed and happie: That doeth stande in dreade and feare of the Lorde vnfaynedly. Out of Sion the Lord shall geue, to him this good blessynge: To se Ierusalem in peace, all dayes of his lyueynge. And to se the sonnes of his sonnes, descendynge of hys bloud: And eke the state of Israell, boeth fortunate and good. The .cxxix. Psalme. Nowe may Israell saye they haue fought ryght sore agaynst me: Uerie oft? from my youth vp, that myne enimies be. Ryght ofte they haue fought against me from my yougth (may he saye) Yet agaynst me could they neuer, preuayle ne haue theyr waye. The plowmen haue plowed my backe and made ther forowes longe: But the iuste Lorde hath cut the bandes, of men wicked and stronge. Let all that hate Sion take shame and be dryuen backe and made: Lyke grasse that groweth on houses, and doeth sodenly fade. So that the reapar can not fynde enough to fyll hys hande. Neither the byndar hys arme full, to laye wythin hys bande. Neither do they that passe by saye, the Lorde geue you blessynge: In the Lordes name we wyshe you good and encrease of all thynge. The .cxxx. Psalme. From the deapth of all miserie, O Lord on the call I Lorde heare my voyce &amp; let thyne eares, geue hede, vnto my crye. For if thou (Lord God) wouldeste marcke synnes, who coulde then be saued? But thou arte full of clemencie, and arte therfore feared. For the haue I loked (O Lorde) so hath my soule also: And in the do I put my truste, boeth in well and in wo. My soule doeth loke &amp; tarie for, the Lorde from the morne tyde. From morne to morne I saye my soule doeth for the Lorde abyde. Let Israell waite on the Lorde, for wyth him is mercie: And wyth the Lorde redemption, is wonderfull plentie. For he redemeth Israel, from al his wyckednes: And setteth all his people free, from theyr iniquities. The .cxxxi. Psalme. O Lorde, myne hert hath not bene proude, neither myne eies loftie: I haue not sought prayse in great thynges, neither clymed to hye. Ille myght I speed if I haue not, though myselfe none other: Then the yonge chylde that is weaned, at home wyth his mother. And the soule or the mynde that doeth, wythin my bodie reste: Is lyke the chyld that lately hath bene tak? from the breste. Oh Israell, waite on the Lorde, truste styl in him I saye: Put all thy confidence in him for euer and foraye. The .cxxxij. Psalme. O Lorde be myndfull of all thynges that haue vexed Dauid: That to his good, all his trouble, maye be alwaye turned. For he hath sworne vnto the Lorde, and vowed solemnely: To the myghtie God of Iacob, and sayed for certentie. Ille myght I spede, if I enter my tent or clyme my bedde: Or if I shall graunte any slepe, to the eies of myne heade. Or if I suffer myne eie leddes, to wyncke or do once nodde: Tyll I fynde a place for the Lorde, and house for Iacobs God. Him haue we hearde in Ephrata, there haue we heard his sounde: And in the fieldes of wyldernes, present we haue him founde. Go we therfor to his dwellynges, &amp; throne where he doeth sitte: And let vs fall downe and worshyp, the stole vnder his fete. Arise (O Lorde) thou that shalt come, into thy quiete reste: Arise thou, I saye, and let the arcke of thy powre be preste. Let thy priestes put on rightuousenes, &amp; let thy good mensynge: And for thy seruant Dauids sake, saye not naye to thy kynge. The Lorde sware trueth vnto Dauid, and wyll it not denie: That he would set vpon his throne, some fruite of his bealy. If thy sonnes shal kepe my comnaunt and lawes that I shall teache: Theyr sonnes also shall weare the crowne, so longe as tyme doeth reache. For the Lorde hath chosen Sion, to be his seate, sayeinge: This is myne euerlastynge rest, here shall be my dwellynge. For I haue chosen hir and wyll geue hir vitailes plentie: And wyth breade wyll I fede hir pore, and them all satisfie. Hir priestes I wyll indue wyth health they shall be in salftie: And the good m? that dwel in hir, shal synge reioyceyngly. In hir wyll I make Dauids horne, &amp; his power for to springe: And in hir I haue prepared, a candle for my kynge. Whose enimies I wil endue, wyth rebuke and wyth shame. But vpon him shall aye florish, his crowne &amp; diadeame, The .cxxxiij. Psalme. Behold howe good a thynge it is, &amp; howe pleasaunt to see: If brothers can dwell togither, &amp; in all pointes agree. It is lyke as if good oyntm?t, that smelleth moste swetely: Beynge shed on the heade should drope, on the bearde by and by. The beard I saye of the hygh priest, that was named Aharon: And should drope on y? cape of the garmentes that he had on. Lyke the dewe of mounte Hermon that, on Stons hille doeth falle: Where the Lorde bade blessynge should be, and lyfe sempiternall. The .cxxxiiij. Psalme. Beholde ye seruantes of the Lorde preach ye the Lorde of myght: All ye, I saye: that stande present, in the Lordes house by nyght. Lyfte vp your handes wyth holines, towarde his sanctuarie. And preach the Lord, shewe forth hys prayse, and eke hys greate mercie. The Lorde geue the out of Sion welth &amp; felicitie: The Lorde I saye that made the earth, and eke the heauen hye. The .cxxxv. Psalme. Oh ye y? be the Lordes seru?tes, prayse his name without staye Al ye y? st?de in y? Lordes house &amp; our goddes courtes I saye. Prayse God (for whye? y? Lord is good) &amp; syng vnto his name: For it is full pleasaunt and good, wherfore prayse ye the same. For God hath chosen vnto hym, Iacob &amp; Israell: To be hys people and hys flocke, thys do I knowe right well. For I knowe that the lorde is greate, and doeth all goddes excell And doeth all thynges at hys pleasure, in heauen, earth, and in hell. Fr? al the borders of the earth, he draweth vp clowdes I knowe: He turneth lyghtnynges into rayne, and maketh the wyndes blowe. He strake and slewe all the fyrste borne, aswell of man as beaste: That were of the frye of Egypt where his flocke was oppreste. He sent forth signes and eke w?ders, amyd Thegyptians lande: So dyd he to kynge Pharao, wyth all his garde or band. Manye and sundrye nations, he dyd also destroye: So dyd he kyll right many kynges, moste puisaunt and myghtie. He destroyed Sichon himselfe, the kynge of Amorrites: And Og kynge of Basan, wyth all kyngdomes of Chananites. And he gaue theyr enheritaunce, &amp; theyr byrthright, I saye: To his people that it myght be, theyr heritage foraye. O Lorde thy name is eternall, so is thy: memorie: Thou shalt neuer be forgotten, thy name shall neuer die. For the Lorde shall iudge his people, he shall reuenge theyr wronge: And from his flocke he shall returne wyth a reioyceynge songe. The Images of the heathen, are of gould and syluer: The worcke that mans hand hath brought forth, and molten togither. For they haue mouthes and do not speake, and eies and do not see: So haue they eares and do not heare, suche worthy thynges they be. They haue a nose, yet in theyr mouth ther is no breath at all: They haue no breath to speake to such as do vpon them call. Lyke whom all such men shall be made, as do make them certayne: And so shall they that put theyr trust in thynges that are so vayne. Ye house of Israell, I saye, preach ye the Lorde therfore: And ye house and stocke of Aharon, preache the Lorde euer more. Ye house and kynred of Leuie, ye priestlye nation: Preache ye the Lorde, O ye that feare the Lorde preach hym eche one. The Lorde that hath hys dwellynge in Ierusalem for aye: Must haue his prayse out of Sion, prayse ye the Lorde I saye. The .cxxxvj. Psalme. Confesse, confesse vnto the Lorde for he is good I saye: Confesse to him for hys goodnes continueth for aye. Confesse vnto the God of goddes, whose goodnes doeth styll laste: Confesse vnto the Lord of lordes, whose mercie is not paste. Because hys goodnes hath no ende, he doeth wonders alone And by hys wisedome he hath made the heauens euerychone. Because his mercie is endlesse, he hath lyfted vp grownde: Aboue the waters, &amp; hath made, two lyghtes boeth greate and rownde. Because hys goodnes hath no ende, he made the sunne so bryght: To rule the daye, &amp; eke the mone &amp; starres to rule the nyght. Because his mercie is endlesse he slewe the fyrste borne all: Of the Egyptians and brought Israell out of thralle. Because his goodnes hath none ende, he dyd this wyth greate myght: And wyth an arme that was styfly stretched out in theyr syght. Because hys mercie is endlesse he dyd the red sea slyt: In sunder and brought Israell, salfe and sounde thorowe it. Because hys goodnes hath none ende, he drowned Pharao Subuertynge hym in the red sea, and hys armie also. Because hys mercie is endlesse, he led through desert lande His owne people, and slewe greate kynges, that dyd hys flocke wythstande. Because his goodnes hath none ende, he slewe kynges moste myghtie: Sichon hym selfe that was the kynge, of Thamorrites Citie. Because hys mercie is endlesse, he slewe Og Basans kynge: And gaue theyr lande &amp; heritage, from them and theyr of sprynge. Because hys goodnes hath none ende he gaue Ogges lande I saye: Unto hys seruaunt Israell, foreuer and for aye. Because hys mercie is endlesse, he had vs remembred: At such tyme as we were but vyle, and were sore oppressed. Because hys goodnes hath none ende, he hath set vs all cleare: From them that were oure enimies, as well far of as nere. Because hys mercie is endelesse, he doeth all beastes feede: And geueth to eche lyueynge thynge, suche fode as it doeth nede. Confesse, confesse, I saye vnto the God celestiall Whose bountifull goodnes shall laste and be sempiternall. The .cxxxvij. Psalme. Vpon the riuers sides we sytte, and wepe moste bytterly. In Babylon, when Sion doeth come to our memorie. And vpon the grene wyllowe tres, that growe in Babilon: We haue hanged vp our swete harpes, and instrumentes echone. For there, they that made heapes of vs, required vs to synge: And to make myrth, sayinge let vs, heare of Sion somethynge. But howe shoulde we synge the Lordes hymnes wyth myrth and melodie: In a straynge lande where we are kept in such captiuitie? But (Oh Ierusalem) if I forget the in myne herte: I praye God that my right hand maye forget all musyckes arte. And that to the roufe of my mouth my tonge maye be set faste If I be not myndfull of the, in tyme of my repaste. Remembre Lorde howe Edomes sonnes haue them selues behaued: At such tyme as Ierusalem, was wasted and spoyled. Make it euacuate (sayed they) remoue euerie stone: Tyll ye come to the verie base &amp; firste foundation. Oh thou daughter of Babylon, that art nowe wasted thus: The man is bleste that maye requite, thynges that thou dydst to vs. The man is bleste that maye laye hande vpon thy little ones: And dashe them hard agaynste the rocke, &amp; agaynste the hard stones. The .cxxxviij. Psalme. I wyll confesse to the (O Lord) wyth herte vnfaynedly. And wyll synge vnto the before the iudges openly. In thyne holy temple I wyll honour and eke confesse: Thyne holy name for thy truethes sake, and eke for thy goodnes. For thou haste made thyne holye worde more excellent in dede: Then all the thynges that euer haue ben of the declared. In the daye when I called the, thou grauntedst vnto me. And by that meane thou dyddest make my mynde stronger in the. Wherfore all the kynges of the earth (Lord) to the shall confesse: Because they haue hearde thyne owne wordes and thy faythfull wyttenes. And they shall synge of and describe the Lordes wayes and his wyll. Because hys maiestie is greate, in all hys doynges styll. For the Lorde of hymselfe is hye, and seeth thynges that be lowe: And such thynges as be haute and hye, he doeth afarre of knowe. When I shall be amydde daynger, then shalt thou refreshe me: And dashe my foes vpon the nose, and set thy seruaunt free. The thynge that the Lord hath be gone in me, he wyll no doubt: Fully finish and make perfect, and brynge it well about. O Lorde thy bountifull goodnes, is eternall in dede: Neither doeth thy worke passe thyne hande, tyll it be finisshed. The .cxxxix. Psalme. Lorde thou hast searched &amp; knowen me, thou doest knowe when I syt: And when I ryse, &amp; longe ago thou knoweste my thought eche whitte. My goynge and my syttyng downe, thou hast throughly tryed And all my wayes thou haste foreseene, and them thoroughly searched. For on my tonge ther is no word, but thou haste knowne it well: I neuer spake one worde (good Lord) wherof thou couldst not tell. Before and eke behynde thou haste made me in fassion: And to me thou haste put thy hande, in my creation. Wonderfull science thou dydste shewe, when thou dydeste me frame. Which was more hyghe, then that I coulde euer attayne the same. Whyther shall I go from thy spirite, or from thy presence flee? For if I clyme vp into heau?, thou arte there before me. And if I make my bed in hell, or go downe to the graue: Thou art present ther &amp; seeste all the corners of the caue. If I should take flyght toward the easte, and dwell be youde all seas. thy power shall reach and rule me there, as it shall the beste please. And if I shal saye with my selfe, the dearcknes shall me hyde: The nyght it selfe is a bryght lyght about me on eche syde. Dearcknes doeth hyde nothynge from the, fornyght lyke daye doeth shyne: And the dearckenes and eke the lyght, are boeth one in thyne eien. And thou haste my reines in thyne hande, and thy possession: And in my mothers wombe thou haste, made me in facion. I wil c?fesse to the because, I am wrought wondrousely: And because thy worckes doe excell, whiche my soule knoweth chiefly. My styffnes and my bones (good Lorde) were not vnknowne to the: When I was formed in the place, where is no lyght to se. And when I was framed and wrought, euen in the longhest parte: Of all the earth, euen as it had ben by the Phrigians arte. Thyne eies sawe me beynge but seed, conceyued wythout shape: And to be written in thy boke none of my partes dyd scape. Thys was done many daies before, my membres were formed: And not one of all those dayes was from thy fore knowledge hyd. But (Oh Lorde God) howe fewe of thy thoughtes do I vnderstande? And yet growe they not to greate summes &amp; many a thousande? Whych if I would rehearse by tale, many mo would they be: Then the sande &amp; when I awake, I do styll thyncke on the. But if thou kyll the wycked man (Lorde God) for his deserte: Then let the man that doth sheade bloude, from thy seruant departe. For they beynge thyne enimies, do speake moste hardily. And do rashly vsurpe thy name committyng blasphemie. Oh Lorde should I not hate thy foes and cruell enimies: And vexe my selfe when they resyste the and agaynste the rise? Yea wyth most deadly hate I wyll, persecute them I saye: And wyll take them as enimies, and deadly foes for aye. Search me (O God) &amp; knowe myne herte, let nought be therin hyd: Do thou proue me &amp; knowe my thoughtes, whether they be wycked. And loke if any thynge be ille, that I do Imagyn: And leade me forth into the waye that all men must go in. The .cxl. Psalme. Lorde set me free from the man that to wyckednes is bent: And preserue thy seruant from the man that is violent. And from such men as Imagyne, all myschiefe in theyr herte: And do dayly renne togither in wars to play theyr parte. And from all such as whett theyr tonges, as doeth the serpent fell: And haue lyke poyson in theyr lyppes as the adder cruell. Lord kepe me out of the powre of him that is vngodly: And saue me from the viol?t, for these would me destroye. For the proude men haue secretlye, layed snares and cordes for me: So haue they stretched out theyre nettes &amp; snares where my wayes be. And thus haue I sayde to the Lorde, thou arte my God I saye: O Lord receyue thou wyth thyne eares, my voyce when I do pray. O Lorde, Lorde, thou arte al the strength that muste be my succoure: Thou doest defende myne heade fr? strypes, when I muste take armoure. Lord, make thou not the wycked man, his desyres to optayne: Ne prospere thou his diligence, in victorie to reigne. Let the mischiefe that wyth theyr lyppes they haue builded, as well: Lyght on the reste, as on the heade, of them that do me quell. Let burnynge coles be caste on them, let them lacke for no payne: Let God sone caste them downe wyth fyre, leste they should ryse agayne. Oh let the man that hath muche talke, haue no sure dwellynge place: And let euell huntte the violent, tyll he falle on hys face. I knowe, that in the abiectes cause, the Lorde wyll do iudgment: And wyll reuenge theyr cause that be, boeth pore and impotent. Certes the iuste men wylt confesse, and acknowledge thy name And the good men shall styll abyde, in thy syght wythout blame. The .cxlj. Psalme. O Lorde, vpon the do I cal, wherfore haste the to me: And with thyne eares receyue my voyce, when I do to the crye. Lorde, let my prayar stande in stede of incense in thy syght: And the lyftynge vp of myne handes, for sacrifice at nyght. O Lorde appoynte thou to my mouth, a garde and custodie: And a thynge that maye kepe the dore of my lyppes in saftie. Do not enclyne or bowe myne herte to any wycked thynge: Leste by wycked mens helpe I do thynges therto belongeynge. Neiter do thou suffer me Lord to vse theyr deyntye thynges: Nor to be geuen to theyr waste, and to their bancketynges. Let the iust stryke me wyth good wyll, and tell me of my misse: Let not myne heade refuse oyntment, that most preciouse is. For so shall I remayne and praye, for them that my foes be: Whylse they imagyne &amp; inuent, all yll thynges agaynst me. Let theyr iudges be sent downe by stonie places and heare: My wordes, for they shall be pleasa?t, &amp; full of hertie chere. Our bones are scattered nygh death and the mouth of the graue: Lyke as where one hath clouen wodde, or dygged vp a caue. But vnto the (O Lorde, O Lorde) myne eies do I styll caste: And haue my trust in the, wherefore, turne not my soule to waste. Kepe me that I fal not into the snare they spred for me: Neither into the snares or gynes of men that wycked be. And let the vngodly and the wycked fall togyther: Into theyr owne nettes, but let me, walke on styll yet further. The .cxlij. Psalme. Wyth my voyce &amp; moste hertie wordes, to the Lorde wyll I crye: And wyth my voyce also I wyll praye to him busily. In his presence I wyll poure out, my wordes and tell my mynde: And wyll open to hym all the dainger that doeth me bynde. And when the spirite that is in me doeth faynte for verie wo Then doest thou knowe my path, &amp; that they hyde snares where I go. When I do loke on the ryght syde, no guide there do I see: All wayes to scape are closed vp, none taketh thought for me. Wherefore (O Lorde) I crie to the and on this wyse I saye. Thou art myne helpe and portion, emonge them that lyue aye. Geue eare and hearcken to my crie, for I am pore in dede: And set me fre from them that haue agaynst me preuayled. Rydde me, I saye, from them that be my persecutours fell: And leade my soule out of prisone, wherin they do me quell. That I may acknowledge thy name, and that the iuste maye be: Full of ioye for the benifites, that thou haste shewed me. The .cxliij. Psalme. Lorde heare my supplication, and perceyue my desyre: And for thy trueth and thy iustice, graunt that I do requyre. Lorde enter not wyth thy seruant, into iudgment and right: For no lyueynge man can be founde, that is iuste in thy syght. For the enmie doeth persecute, my soule most cruelly: And hath dashed my lyfe agaynst, the gro?d most spytefully. And into dearcke places he hath, thruste me headlonge also: Euen as I were lyke to the men that, were deade longe ago. And my spyrite wythin me doeth faynte, &amp; doeth begyne to sayle: And myne herte wythin my bodie, is striken wyth meruayle. Yet do I calle to memorie, the tymes that earste haue ben: And to comment and treate of al thy deedes I do begynne. I do c?ment and speake (I saye) of all that thou haste done: And of the worcke of thyne handes (Lorde) I do talke and reasone. Myne handes I haue opened to the, and lyfte them vp on hye: And my soule doeth wishe after the as the earth that is drye. O Lorde do thou heare me shortlye, and graunt me my request: For my sprite is allredy faynte, and fayleth in my breaste. vnto the synge. For God geueth health vnto kynges, and hath deliuered: Hys seruant Dauid from the swerde that would haue him kylled. Deliuer me, and set me free, from strayngers powre and myght: Whose mouth speaketh vayne thynges and eke theyr hande do nothynge right. That in theyr youth oure sonnes maye sprynge, and growe vp lyke yonge trees: And our daughters lyke embossementes, decked lyke palaices. And let our store houses be full, yeldynge vitayle for aye: And our ewes yeane eleauen thousande in our streates and highwaye. Let our oxen learne to labour, let not our walles fall downe: Let ther be none exyle of men, nor out crye in our towne. That people is happye and bleste, that lyueth in this sorte: Bleste is the people whose God is, the Lorde of all confort. The .cxlv. Psalme. Oh thou that arte my God &amp; kynge, I wyll the magnifie: And thyne holy name wil I preach tyme out of memorie. I wyll preach the dayly I saye, my worckes shall do the same: And wythout ende of tyme I wyll prayse thy moste holy name. Greate is the Lorde and most worthy of all prayse wythout doubt: Whose magnitude is such that it can not be searched out. Al tymes doe prayse thy worckes (O Lord) they are allwaye praysed: And right so are thy noble actes, euermore declared. I wyll talke of the decore of thy maiesties glorie: And of the thynges that thy handes haue, wrought so wonderfully. The strength of thy wonderfull worckes, men shall declare and preache: And thy magnitude and greatnes, I wyll declare and teache. The memorie of thy goodnes, &amp; passeynge great mercie. Men shall brynge forth and celebrate, thy iustice merily. The Lorde is good and mercifull, and also patient: Not hastie to be reuenged, but to much mercie bent. Towardes all men is the Lord right good, none can this thynge denye: And vpon all hys h?dye worckes, he sheweth his mercie. All the worckes of thyne holy h?des (Lord) do to the confesse. And men that be thy loueynge frendes, do the preach and wytnes. The maiestie of thy kyngdome men do declare and preache: And of thy strength and fortitude they do frame all their speache. That vnto men they maye expounde, thy doynges so myghtie: And eke the maiestie of all thy noble imperie. Thy kyngdome is sempiternall, it had no begynnynge: And thy rule lasteth through all tymes, and shall haue no endynge. All that are lyke to falle, the Lorde doeth holde vp and sustayne: And such as are alredie downe, he lyfteth vp agayne. The eies of all thynges loke on the, and do thy wyll abyde: And thou doeste geue them theyr due foode, in the proue tyme and tyde. Thyne hand thou settest wyde vpon, and doest full satisfie: The appetite of all the thynges that lyue vnder the skye. The Lorde is iuste in all hys wayes, vniustly doeth he nought: So is he benigne and gentle, in all that he hath wrought. The Lord is preste and styll at hande, with all that on hym crye To all I saye that call on hym, wyth herte vnfaynedly. And to all such as do hym feare, he doeth all that they wyll: He doeth he are theyr clamour and crye, and eke kepe them from the. The Lorde kepeth all that loue hym, none ille shall come them nye But he destroyeth all that be wycked and vngodly. By mouth shall speake the Lordes praises and all flesh shall declare Hys holy name from tyme to tyme tyll no tyme be to spare. The .cxlvj. Psalme. My soule prayse thou the Lord for I, wyll prayse him my lyfe longe. And whylse I lyue vnto my God, I wyll aye make my songe: Put not your truste or confidence, in princes or in man That hath no maner powre to saue, though he do what he can. Whose bodie when the breath is gone, shal turne to earth agayne: And then shall all hys thoughtes decaye, as moste foleyshe and vayne. The man is bleste that hath the God, of Iacobbe for hys ayde. And whose hope and only truste is, vpon hys Lorde God stayed. For he made boeth heauen and earth and all thynges in the same: And hath kept hys true couenant, for euer wythout blame. So doeth he reuenge the oppreste, and nourishe the hungrye: And the Lord lowseth the captyue, that lyue in miserie. The Lorde doeth open the blyndes eies, &amp; lyfte vp such as falle: And the iust (that walke in hys wayes) he loueth aboue all. He kepeth strayngers &amp; maketh Orphantes and wydowes hye: But he depraueth men that are wycked and vngodly. The Lorde thy God, I saye, Sion, shall reigne for euer more: Through all ages and tymes I saye, prayse ye the Lorde therfore. The .cxlvij. Psalme. Prayse God, for it is verie good, and pleasaunt for to synge: To our God, and to geue hym prayse, is also besemeynge. For the citie Ierusalem, the Lorde doeth buylde certayne: And wyll gather suche as are fledde, and brynge them home agayne. He healeth the broken herted, &amp; eke theyr sorowes all He hath the number of the starres, &amp; doeth them by name calle. Our Lord is greate, and eke of powre excedynge greate in dede: Whose wisedome and intellygence, can not be numbered. For he doeth brynge vp to honour m? that are oppressed: And to the grounde he doeth caste downe, such men as are wycked. Synge to the Lorde wyth verse for verse, and thanckes geueynge also: And synge to our God wyth the harppe, that so swetly doeth go. For he doeth hyde the skye wyth clowdes, and make rayne for the grounde: And causeth great plentie of grasse on hygh hylles to be founde. He geueth pasture and fedynge, vnto the beastes all: And to the rauens yonge chyckenes, that do vpon hym call. That he delyteth in is not the force of horses stronge. Nor yet the legges of myghtie men, be they neuer so longe. And in such men as do feare hym, the Lord hath his delyte: And in such as do tarie for hys mercie daye &amp; nyght. O thou citie Ierusalem, prayse the Lorde wythout staye And thou Sion prayse thou thy God, and walke forth in hys waye. For he doeth fortifie thy gates, and make thy dore barres stronge. So doeth he geue felicitie, vnto thy chyldr? yonge. And he hath ordeyned that peace, should in all thy coastes be: And wyth the fatnes of the wheate, he hath satisfied the. He sendeth downe hys holye worde, vnto the earth so lowe. That it myght renne forth spedilye, and that men myght hym knowe. He geueth snowe as whyte as woule, such is hys powre and myght. And lyke asshes he sprinckeleth, the hore froste in the nyght. He casteth out his Isse lyke plates, who can his colde sustayne? And sendynge downe his holy worde, he melteth them agayne. He melteth them agayne I saye, and maketh the wynde blowe: Upon them that the waters myght, take theyr ryght course and flowe. But vnto Iacob he geueth, his worde and his precept And to Israell his decres and iudgmentes to be kept. He hath not dealed on this sorte wyth any nation; Nor shewed hys iudgmentes vnto them, prayse the Lorde, O Son. The .cxlviij. Psalme. Oh you heauenly citisens, prayse ye the Lorde on hye: Prayse him in the hygh places and do hys name magnifie. Prayse ye him (Oh his angelles all) that are his messengers: Prayse hym also all ye that be hys heauenly souldiers. Oh sunne and mone, prayse ye the Lorde, and all ye starres so cleare. prayse ye the Lord, Oh ye heauens, that most hygh do appeare. Ye hygh heauens I saye prayse hym, and ye waters that be: Heaped togither in the cloudes, the Lorde your God prayse ye: Let these thynges prayse the Lorde I saye and eke his holy name: For at hys only worde he hath create &amp; made the same. And them he hath established, for euer to abyde: And appoynted them an order from whiche they can not slyde. Prayse ye the Lorde ye lyueynge thynges that on the earth do go. Ye dragons and ye deapnesses, prayse ye the Lorde also. The fyre, the hayle, the snowe and myste, and eke the wynde stormie. That foloweth the Lordes precept, let it prayse hym on hye. The mountaynes and al little hylles, the tree that fruitfull is: And all the Ceders of the wodde, prayse ye the kynge of blysse. Let all bruite beastes and crepeynge thynges, and all the byrdes that flye. Let the kynges of the earth &amp; their peoples prayse hym truly. Let the princes and all iudges, that rule the earth by myght: All yonge men and eke all virgynes, prayse hym boeth daye and nyght. Let all men that are of yeres olde, and of tyme auncient: And also men of growynge age, to the lordes prayse be bent. Let these I saye, prayse the Lordes name, for it only is hye: And doeth excede the earth and eke the heauen in glorie. And he hath made his people stronge, and hys frendes prayse worthy The sonnes of Iacob, a people that he setteth store by. The .cxlix. Psalme. Synge a newe songe vnto the Lorde reioyce in hym alone: And synge hys prayse in hys deare church and congregation. Let Israeli reioyse in hym, that made him of nothynge: And let the chyldr? of Sion, reioyce in theyr owne kynge. Let them prayse his name wyth the pype, and eke wyth the tymbrelle: And synge to hym vpon the harppe, that sowneth swete and well. For the Lorde doeth fauour his flocke, and eke hys people all And doeth sett forth all such wyth health, as are captyue and thralle. Let them that be gentle and good, reioyce wyth great honour: And in theyr beddes let them reioyce, and synge wyth greate pleasure. Let goddes prayse be styll in theyr throte, let them speak: no vayne worde. And let goddes worde be in theyr hande, as a two edged sword. That on the Heathen they maye be reuenged of theyr wronge: And right so correct the peoples that they shall dwell emonge. And that with manicles they maye bynde theyr princes ech one: And eke theyr Lordes and maiestrates, with fetters of Iron. That as it is written, God maye, reuenge hym on them all: Whiche shall be prayse to hys dearlynges. that on hys name do call. The .Cl. Psalme. Prayse ye God in his holy place, &amp; congregation: And prayse hym in the sure grownde of hys dominion. Prayse hym for hys myghtie powres sake and hys valiauntnes: And right so do ye prayse hym for, hys excedynge greatnes. Prayse hym wyth the sowne of trumpet, prayse hym wyth harppe and lute: Prayse hym, I saye, wyth the tymbrel and wyth the pype or flute. Prayse hym with organnes and rebecke, and cymballes of lowde sownde. Prayse hym, I saye, wyth such cymballes, as make the voyce rebownde. Let eche spirite and lyueynge thynge, prayse God boeth night and daye: Let them all worcke hys holy wyll, prayse ye the Lorde I saye. The ende of the Psalter. Magnificat &amp;c. Luce .i. My soule doeth magnifie the Lorde euery daye and houre: And my sprite doeth reioyce in God that is my sauiour. Because he hath loked vp? hys h?dmaides lowe degree: For loe, hense sorth men shal reporte me right happie to be. For he that is myghtie hath done right noble thynges to me; And therfore is hys name holy &amp; euer more shalbe. And his mercie is stretched forth vpon all progenies: From age to age, on th? that haue hys feare before theyr eies. By the powre of his myghtie arme, he hath worthyly wrought: He hath scattered the proude men, in theyr owne secrete thought. He hath deposed the myghtie out of their royall place: And promoted them to honour, whose degre was but base. The hungry he hath fylled wyth, good thynges in greate plentie: So hath he sent the ryche awaye, wythout and quite emptie. He hath taken into fauour Israell his seruante: That he myght be myndfull of hys mercie &amp; couenaunt. Euen as he hath spoken vnto our fathers heretofore: That is to saye Habraham and his seede for euermore. Nunc dimittis &amp;c. Luc. ij. Lord, nowe letteste thou thy seru?t, departe from hense in peace: Accordynge to thyne holy worde, &amp; thy faythfull promesse. For nowe myne eies haue sene thyne health and thy saluation: Before the face of euerie people and nation. Alyght to lyghten the Heathen through out the worlde so wyde: And the glorie of thy people Israell on eche syde. Benedictus &amp;c. Luc. i. The Lorde the God of Israell, is for to be praysed: For he visited his people, and hath them redemed. And in the house of Dauid his seruant he hath erect: The home of health for vs that be his chosen and electe. As he hath spoken by the mouth of his prophetes holye: That from the begynnynge haue bene preachars of veritie. Declareynge that we should be made false from our enimies: And from the powre of all them that hate vs in anye wise. That towardes our fathers he myght vse his bountifull mercie: And call hys holy testament into hys memorie. And that he myght performe the othe that he had firmely sworne: Unto our father Habraham longe before we were borne. And that he myght geue vs the powr to serue hym wythout feare: Beynge free from our enmies powre, whose heauie yocke we beare. And that in holynes of lyfe and iustice in his syght: All the tyme that we shall lyue here, as well by daye as nyght. And thou chylde shalt be called the prophete of the moste hye: For thou shalt go before hys face, hys wayes to make redie. To geue his people knowledge that they shall theyr soule health wynne: Only by the forgeuenes of theyr trespasse &amp; their synne. By the bowelles of the mercie of our God most myghtie: Where wyth the bryght daye springe hath nowe visited vs from hye. To shyne to them that sate in deathes shadowe and in dearcknes: To set our fete strayght in the waye that leadeth vnto peace. Benedicite &amp;c. Daniel .iij. All ye worckes of the Lorde, prayse hym, speake well of hym I saye: Prayse and extole his holye name for euer and for aye. O ye that be the Lordes angelles and messengers at nede: Speake euer well of hym, prayse hym, and extole hym in dede. Ye heauens speake wel of the Lord, prayse and extole hym aye: All ye waters that are aboue, do ye the same I saye. All ye powres of the Lord, se that ye speake good of hym styll Prayse and extole him euermore accordynge to his wyll. Sunne &amp; moone speake good of the Lord, prayse and extole him aye: And ye starres of the hygh heauen, do ye right so I saye. All rayne and swete dewe blesse the Lord, prayse and exalte hym hye: And ye wyndes of God se ye do the same eternally. Fyre and heate speake good of the Lorde, laude and prayse hym euer. Colde wynter and hote somerse ye do in lyke maner. Ye dewes and hore froste, blesse the Lord, prayse and extole hys name Froste and extreme rigoure of colde, do ye alwaye the same. Ise and snowe, speake good of the Lorde, extole him euer more. And ye nyghtes and dayes se ye do walke after the same lore. Lygh and darckenes blesse ye the Lorde, laude and extole hym aye: Lyghtnynge and cloudes do ye the same, wythouten stoppe or staye. Let the earth speake good of the Lorde, &amp; blesse hym for hir store: Let hir laude and extolle hys name wyth prayses euer more. Ye mountaynes &amp; ye little hylles, se that ye blesse the Lorde: Laude &amp; extole his holy name alwaye wyth one accorde All ye thynges that budde on the earthe, the Lorde your God blesse ye: And let hys laude &amp; extollynge euer emonge you be. Ye sprynges, speake ye good of the Lorde, laude and extole him styll: Ye seas and freshe riuers also, do the same wyth good wyll. Ye whalles and all thynges that moue in the waters, blesse the Lorde. Laude and extole hys holye name alwayes wyth one accorde. All foules of the ayre blesse the Lord, prayse and extole hym aye: All beastes (wylde and tame) se that ye dothe same thynge alwaye. Ye sonnes of men blesse ye the Lord, laude and extole hym styll And let Israell do the same with full consent of wyll. Ye priestes of the Lorde, prayse the Lorde, extole hym euermore: And all ye seruantes of the Lorde, folowe ye the same lore. Ye spirites and soules of iuste men, blesse ye the Lorde alwaye. Ye saynctes and ye of humble herte, do the same wythout staye. O Ananie, O Azarie, and thou O Misael Se y? ye cease not to extole y? Lord of Israell. Te Deum laudamus &amp;c. We prayse the as God, and confesse the, the Lorde for to be: And as father euerlastynge, all men do worshyppe the. To the crie all angelles, the heauens with all the powres therin: Wythout ceaseynge crie vnto the, Cherub &amp; Seraphin. Holy, holy, holy, Lorde God of Sabaoth, they crye: Heauen and earth are full with thy maiestie and glorie. The gloriouse company of Apostles do praise the: So do the number of prophetes that so prayse worthy be. The noble armie of martyrs prayse the wyth theyr wytnes: And the holy church through the worlde, doeth the alwaye confesse. They do confesse the, father of infinite maiestie: Wyth thyne honourable and true sonne, whome thou haste onlye. The holye goste the confortoure they do also confesse: And thou (O Christe) arte the kyng of glorie that is endlesse. Thou arte the euerlastynge sonne of the father certayne. Who to deliuer man dydste not the virgynes wombe disdayne. When thou hadste ouercome the stynge of death thou dydste open: Unto all faythfull beleuers, the kyngdome of heauen. Thou sytest at the ryght hande of God, in thy fathers glorie: And to come thense to iudge thou arte loked for certenly. To helpe thy pore seruantes therfore we humbly besech the: Whom wyth thy preciouse bloude thou haste redemed and made free. Cause thou them to be numbered and had in memorie Wyth thy chosen and holy saynctes, in eternall glorie. Lorde make thou thyne owne people salfe, blesse thyne enheritaunce: Gouerne them and set them on hye, do them euer aduaunce. We do dayly blesse &amp; prayse the, we prayse thy name, I saye: From tyme to tyme for euermore, from age to age for aye. Uouchesafe (O Lorde) this daye to kepe thy seruantes from all synne: To take mercie on vs (O Lorde) to take mercie begyne. Shewe thy mercie on vs (O Lorde) let it vpon vs be: As we haue put our c?fid?ce &amp; only trust in y? I haue trusted in the (O Lord) in the haue I trusted: Graunt therfore Lorde that thy seruasit be neuer confounded. Quicumque vult &amp;c. Athanatius. Who so wylbe saued muste kepe before all other thynge. The Catholycke &amp; c?mune fayth that of the trueth doeth sprynge. Which fayth vnlesse a man do kepe whole and vndefiled: No doubt he shall for euer more perishe and be dampned. And the fayth catholycke is this, that we worshippe truly; One God in three persons &amp; the same three in vnitie. And that neither confoundynge the persons makynge them one Nor yet diuidyng the substaunce that is but one alone. For the father and sonne are two distynct persons in dede: And fr? th? boeth y? holy goste is also diuided. Yet of these three persons ther is but one diuinitie: Equale glorie &amp; in lyke sorte eternal maiestie. For loke what one the father is, the sonne is of that sorte: And right so is the holy goste, the authour of conforte. The father is increate &amp; was neuer made certayne: No more was sonne nor holy goste that togither do reygne. The father is immense and can neuer be measured: So are the sonne &amp; holy goste immense, not conteyned. The father is eternall and had neuer begynynge: So are the sonne and holye goste and shall haue no endynge. Yet are there not three eternall, wyth outen begynnynge: But only one eternall God, that shall haue no endynge. Euen as there be not three vnmade, nor three vnmeasured: But one God that was neuer made and one vnconteyned. In lyke maner the father is euermore almightie. So are the sonne and holye goste in theyr diuinitie. Yet are ther not three in substaunce that be omnipotent: But one only almyghtie God that hath the regiment. The father is God and so is his only s?ne also Wyth the holy goste, yet not three, but one God and no moe. So is euerie one of them Lorde by hym selfe alone: Yet are they not three Lordes I saye, they are all three but one. For as trueth causeth vs to calle eche persone God and Lorde: So to calle th? three goddes or lordes, doeth not ther wyth accorde. The father hath not bene made nor created of any: Neyther begotte at any tyme the trueth to testifie. The only sonne of the father, commeth fr? hym only: Not made neither created but begote eternally. And from the father and the sonne, the holy goste doeth springe Not made, create, neither begote, but only procedynge. One father and not three therfore, we acknowledge to be: One sonne and eke one holy goste, we c?fesse and not three. And in this holy trinitie, ther is no thynge in dede: That in tyme is more auncient, or else that doeth succede. There is nothynge greater or lesse, but the three persons all: Are of lyke tyme and are also emonge them selues equale. So that in all poyntes (as is sayde) boeth one in trinitie: And also three muste be worshypt in one sole vnitie. Whoso euer therfore wyll be saued eternally, Let not the same fayle for to thyncke thus of the trinitie. It is also necessarie vnto saluation: That he beleue most stedfastly, Christes incarnation. The vpright fayth therfore, is to beleue and to confesse. That our Lorde Iesu Christe, goddes sonne, is God and man doubtlesse. God of hys fathers substaunce and gote ere the worlde began: And borne in the worlde he is of his mothers substa?ce, man. He is perfect God in substaunce, so is he perfect man Consistynge of a reasonable soule and of flesh humane. He is equale wyth hys father touchynge diuinitie But hys fathers inferiour in hys humanitie. Who though he be boeth God and man, yet is he neuer twayne: But one only Lorde Iesus Christ, boeth God and man certayne. One not by turnynge the godheade into mans vile nature. But by takeynge humanitie vnto the godheade pure. In conclusion he is one, not by confution: Of the substaunce, but by the vnitie of the persone. For as the reasonable soule and, flesh are one man only: So is God &amp; man but one Christ, the trueth to testifie. Who suffryng for our health went downe to the sprites infernall: And the thyrde daye he rose agayne from emonge dead men all. He went vp to heauens and sytteth at his fathers ryght hande: Whense he shall come to iudge boeth quicke and deade by sea and lande. At whose comeynge all men muste rise agayne in theyr bodies: And geue a compt of theyr owne dedes, and that in moste strayte wyse. And suche as haue done well shall go into lyfe eternall: But the euell doars shall into eternall fyer fall. This is the commune fayth which muste be firmely beleued: Of all suche men as certenly do truste to be saued. Glorie be to God the father, the sonne and holy goste: As hath bene, is, and eke shalbe, tyll mynde of tyme be loste. FINIS.</field>
