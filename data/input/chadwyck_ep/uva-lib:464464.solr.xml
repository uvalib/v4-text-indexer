      <field name="fulltext">In his Temple doth every man speak of his honour. Psal. 29.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Dedication. Lord, my first fruits present themselves to thee; Yet not mine neither: for from thee they came, And must return. Accept of them and me, And make us strive, who shall sing best thy name. Turn their eyes hither, who shall make a gain: Theirs, who shall hurt themselves or me, refrain, The Church-porch. Perirrhanterium. Thou, whose sweet youth and early hopes inhance Thy rate and price, and mark thee for a treasure; Hearken unto a Verser, who may chance Ryme thee to good, and make a bait of pleasure. A verse may finde him, who a sermon flies, And turn delight into a sacrifice. Beware of lust: it doth pollute and foul Whom God in Baptisme washt with his own blood. It blots thy lesson written in thy soul; The holy lines cannot be understood. How dare those eyes upon a Bible look, Much lesse towards God, whose lust is all their book? Abstain wholly, or wed. Thy bounteous Lord Allows thee choise of paths: take no by-wayes; But gladly welcome what he doth afford; Not grudging, that thy lust hath bounds and staies. Continence hath his joy: weigh both; and so If rottennesse have more, let Heaven go. If God had laid all common, certainly Man would have been th'incloser: but since now God hath impal'd us, on the contrarie Man breaks the fence, and every ground will plough. O what were man, might he himself misplace! Sure to be crosse he would shift feet and face. Drink not the third glasse, which thou canst not tame, When once it is within thee; but before Mayst rule it, as thou list; and poure the shame, Which it would poure on thee, upon the floore. It is most just to throw that on the ground, Which would throw me there, if I keep the round. He that is drunken, may his mother kill Bigge with his sister: he hath lost the reins, Is outlawd by himself: all kinde of ill Did with his liquour slide into his veins. The drunkard forfets Man, and doth devest All worldly right, save what he hath by beast. Shall I, to please anothers wine-sprung minde, Lose all mine own? God hath giv'n me a measure Short of his canne, and bodie; must I finde A pain in that, wherein he findes a pleasure? Stay at the third glasse: if thou lose thy hold, Then thou art modest, and the wine grows bold. If reason move not Gallants, quit the room, (All in a shipwrack shift their severall way) Let not a common ruine thee intombe: Be not a beast in courtesie; but stay, Stay at the third cup, or forgo the place. Wine above all things doth Gods stamp deface. Yet, if thou sinne in wine or wantonnesse, Boast not thereof; nor make thy shame thy glorie. Frailtie gets pardon by submissivenesse; But he that boasts, shuts that out of his storie. He makes flat warre with God, and doth defie With his poore clod of earth the spacious sky. Take not his name, who made thy mouth, in vain: It gets thee nothing, and hath no excuse. Lust and wine plead a pleasure, avarice gain: But the cheap swearer through his open sluce Lets his soul runne for nought, as little fearing. Were I an Epicure, I could bate swearing. When thou dost tell anothers jest, therein Omit the oathes, which true wit cannot need: Pick out of tales the mirth, but not the sinne. He pares his apple, that will cleanly feed. Play not away the vertue of that name, Which is thy best stake, when griefs make thee tame. The cheapest sinnes most dearely punisht are; Because to shun them also is so cheap: For we have wit to mark them, and to spare. O crumble not away thy souls fair heap. If thou wilt die, the gates of hell are broad: Pride and full sinnes have made the way a road. Lie not; but let thy heart be true to God, Thy mouth to it, thy actions to them both: Cowards tell lies, and those that fear the rod; The stormie working soul spits lies and froth. Dare to be true. Nothing can need a ly: A fault, which needs it most, grows two thereby. Flie idlenesse, which yet thou canst not flie By dressing, mistressing, and complement. If those take up thy day, the sunne will crie Against thee: for his light was onely lent. God gave thy soul brave wings; put not those feathers Into a bed, to sleep out all ill weathers. Art thou a Magistrate? then be severe: If studious; copie fair, what time hath blurr'd; Redeem truth from his jawes: if souldier, Chase brave employments with a naked sword Throughout the world. Fool not: for all may have, If they dare try, a glorious life, or grave. O England! full of sinne, but most of sloth; Spit out thy flegme, and fill thy brest with glorie: Thy Gentrie bleats, as if thy native cloth Transfus'd a sheepishnesse into thy storie: Not that they all are so; but that the most Are gone to grasse, and in the pasture lost. This losse springs chiefly from our education. Some till their ground, but let weeds choke their sonne: Some mark a partridge, never their childes fashion: Some ship them over, and the thing is done. Studie this art, make it thy great designe; And if Gods image move thee not, let thine. Some great estates provide, but doe not breed A mast'ring minde; so both are lost thereby: Or els they breed them tender, make them need All that they leave: this is flat povertie. For he, that needs five thousand pound to live, Is full as poore as he, that needs but five. The way to make thy sonne rich, is to fill His minde with rest, before his trunk with riches: For wealth without contentment, climbes a hill To feel those tempests, which fly over ditches. But if thy sonne can make ten pound his measure, Then all thou addest may be call'd his treasure. When thou dost purpose ought, (within thy power) Be sure to doe it, though it be but small: Constancie knits the bones, and makes us stowre, When wanton pleasures becken us to thrall. Who breaks his own bond, forfeiteth himself: What nature made a ship, he makes a shelf. Doe all things like a man, not sneakingly: Think the king sees thee still; for his King does. Simpring is but a lay-hypocrisie: Give it a corner, and the clue undoes. Who fears to do ill, sets himself to task: Who fears to do well, sure should wear a mask. Look to thy mouth; diseases enter there. Thou hast two sconses, if thy stomack call; Carve, or discourse; do not a famine fear. Who carves, is kind to two; who talks, to all. Look on meat, think it dirt, then eat a bit; And say withall, Earth to earth I commit. Slight those who say amidst their sickly healths, Thou liv'st by rule. What doth not so, but man? Houses are built by rule, and common-wealths. Entice the trusty sunne, if that you can, From his Ecliptick line: becken the skie. Who lives by rule then, keeps good companie. Who keeps no guard upon himself, is slack, And rots to nothing at the next great thaw. Man is a shop of rules, a well truss'd pack, Whose every parcell under-writes a law. Lose not thy self, nor give thy humours way: God gave them to thee under lock and key. By all means use sometimes to be alone. Salute thy self: see what thy soul doth wear. Dare to look in thy chest; for'tis thine own: And tumble up and down what thou find'st there. Who cannot rest till hee good fellows finde, He breaks up house, turns out of doores his minde. Be thriftie, but not covetous: therefore give Thy need, thine honour, and thy friend his due. Never was scraper brave man. Get to live; Then live, and use it: els, it is not true That thou hast gotten. Surely use alone Makes money not a contemptible stone. Never exceed thy income. Youth may make Ev'n with the yeare: but age, if it will hit, Shoots a bow short, and lessens still his stake, As the day lessens, and his life with it. Thy children, kindred, friends upon thee call; Before thy journey fairly part with all. Yet in thy thriving still misdoubt some evil; Left gaining gain on thee, and make thee dimme To all things els. Wealth is the conjurers devil; Whom when he thinks he hath, the devil hath him. Gold thou mayst safely touch, but if it stick Unto thy hands, it woundeth to the quick. What skills it, if a bag of stones or gold About thy neck do drown thee? raise thy head; Take starres for money; starres not to be told By any art, yet to be purchased. None is so wastefull as the scraping dame. She loseth three for one; her soul, rest, fame. By no means runne in debt: take thine own measure. Who cannot live on twentie pound a yeare, Cannot on fourtie: he's a man of pleasure, A kinde of thing that's for it self too deere. The curious unthrift makes his cloth too wide, And spares himself, but would his taylor chide. Spend not on hopes. They that by pleading clothes Do fortunes seek, when worth and service fail, Would have their tale beleeved for their oathes, And are like empty vessels undersail. Old courtiers know this; therefore set out so, As all the day thou mayst hold out to go. In clothes, cheap handsomnesse doth bear the bell. Wisedome's a trimmer thing, then shop e're gave. Say not then, This with that lace will do well; But, This with my discretion will be brave. Much curiousnesse is a perpetuall wooing Nothing with labour; folly long a doing. Play not for gain, but sport. Who playes for more, Then he can lose with pleasure, stakes his heart; Perhaps his wives too, and whom she hath bore: Servants and churches also play their part. Onely a herauld, who that way doth passe, Findes his crackt name at length in the church-glasse. If yet thou love game at so deere a rate, Learn this, that hath old gamesters deerely cost: Dost lose? rise up: dost winne? rise in that state. Who strive to sit out losing hands, are lost. Game is a civil gunpowder, in peace Blowing up houses with their whole increase. In conversation boldnesse now bears sway. But know, that nothing can so foolish be, As empty boldnesse: therefore first assay To stuffe thy minde with solid braverie; Then march on gallant: get substantiall worth. Boldnesse guilds finely, and will set it forth. Be sweet to all. Is thy complexion sowre? Then keep such companie; make them thy allay: Get a sharp wife, a servant that will lowre. A stumbler stumbles least in rugged way. Command thy self in chief. He lifes warre knows, Whom all his passions follow, as he goes. Catch not at quarrels. He that dares not speak Plainly and home, is coward of the two. Think not thy fame at ev'ry twitch will break: By great deeds shew, that thou canst little do; And do them not: that shall thy wisdome be; And change thy temperance into braverie. If that thy fame with ev'ry toy be pos'd, 'Tis a thinne webbe, which poysonous fancies make! But the great souldiers honour was compos'd Of thicker stuffe, which would endure a shake. Wisdome picks friends; civilitie playes the rest. A toy shunn'd cleanly passeth with the best. Laugh not too much: the wittie man laughs least: For wit is newes onely to ignorance. Lesse at thine own things laugh; lest in the jest Thy person share, and the conceit advance. Make not thy sport, abuses: for the fly That feeds on dung, is coloured thereby. Pick out of mirth, like stones out of thy ground, Profanenesse, filthinesse, abusivenesse. These are the scumme, with which course wits abound: The fine may spare these well, yet not go lesse. All things are bigge with jest: nothing that's plain, But may be wittie, if thou hast the vein. Wit's an unruly engine, wildly striking Sometimes a friend, sometimes the engineer. Hast thou the knack? pamper it not with liking: But if thou want it, buy it not too deere. Many affecting wit beyond their power, Have got to be a deare fool for an houre. A sad wise valour is the brave complexion, That leads the van, and swallows up the cities. The gigler is a milk-maid, whom infection, Or a fir'd beacon frighteth from his ditties. Then he's the sport: the mirth then in him rests, And the sad man is cock of all his jests. Towards great persons use respective boldnesse: That temper gives them theirs, and yet doth take Nothing from thine: in service, care, or coldnesse Doth ratably thy fortunes marre or make. Feed no man in his sinnes: for adulation Doth make thee parcell-devil in damnation. Envie not greatnesse: for thou mak'st thereby Thy self the worse, and so the distance greater. Be not thine own worm: yet such jealousie, As hurts not others, but may make thee better, Is a good spurre. Correct thy passions spite; Then may the beasts draw thee to happy light. When basenesse is exalted, do not bate The place its honour, for the persons sake. The shrine is that which thou dost venerate; And not the beast, that bears it on his back. I care not though the cloth of state should be Not of rich arras, but mean tapestrie. Thy friend put in thy bosome: wear his eies Still in thy heart, that he may see what's there. If cause require, thou art his sacrifice; Thy drops of bloud must pay down all his fear: But love is lost; the way of friendship's gone, Though David had his Jonathan, Christ his John. Yet be not surety, if thou be a father. Love is a personall debt. I cannot give My childrens right, nor ought he take it: rather Both friends should die, then hinder them to live. Fathers first enter bonds to natures ends; And are her sureties, ere they are a friends. If thou be single, all thy goods and ground Submit to love; but yet not more then all. Give one estate, as one life. None is bound To work for two, who brought himself to thrall. God made me one man; love makes me no more, Till labour come, and make my weaknesse score. In thy discourse, if thou desire to please: All such is courteous, usefull, new, or wittie. Usefulnesse comes by labour, wit by ease; Courtesie grows in court; news in the citie. Get a good stock of these, then draw the card; That suites him best, of whom thy speech is heard. Entice all neatly to what they know best; For so thou dost thy self and him a pleasure: (But a proud ignorance will lose his rest, Rather then shew his cards) steal from his treasure What to ask further. Doubts well rais'd do lock The speaker to thee, and preserve thy stock. If thou be Master-gunner, spend not all That thou canst speak, at once; but husband it, And give men turns of speech: do not forestall By lavishnesse thine own, and others wit, As if thou mad'st thy will. A civil guest Will no more talk all, then eat all the feast. Be calm in arguing: for fiercenesse makes Errour a fault, and truth discourtesie. Why should I feel another mans mistakes More, then his sicknesses or povertie? In love I should: but anger is not love, Nor wisdome neither: therefore gently move: Calmnesse is great advantage: he that lets Another chafe, may warm him at his fire: Mark all his wandrings, and enjoy his frets; As cunning fencers suffer heat to tire. Truth dwels not in the clouds: the bow that's there, Doth often aim at, never hit the sphere. Mark what another sayes: for many are Full of themselves, and answer their own notion. Take all into thee; then with equall care Ballance each dramme of reason, like a potion. If truth be with thy friend, be with them both: Share in the conquest, and confesse a troth. Be usefull where thou livest, that they may Both want, and wish thy pleasing presence still. Kindnesse, good parts, great places are the way To compasse this. Finde out mens wants and will, And meet them there. All worldly joyes go lesse To the one joy of doing kindnesses. Pitch thy behaviour low, thy projects high; So shalt thou humble and magnanimous be: Sink not in spirit: who aimeth at the sky, Shoots higher much then he that means a tree. A grain of glorie mixt with humblenesse Cures both a fever and lethargicknesse. Let thy minde still be bent, still plotting where, And when, and how the businesse may be done. Slacknesse breeds worms; but the sure traveller, Though he alight sometimes, still goeth on. Active and stirring spirits live alone. Write on the others, Here lies such a one. Slight not the smallest losse, whether it be In love or honour: take account of all; Shine like the sunne in every corner: see Whether thy stock of credit swell, or fall. Who say, I care not, those I give for lost; And to instruct them, 'twill not quit the cost. Scorn no mans love, though of a mean degree; (Love is a present for a mightie king) Much lesse make any one thine enemie. As gunnes destroy, so may a little sling. The cunning workman never doth refuse The meanest tool, that he may chance to use. All forrain wisdome doth amount to this, To take all that is given; whether wealth, Or love, or language; nothing comes amisse: A good digestion turneth all to health: And then as farre as fair behaviour may, Strike off all scores; none are so cleare as they. Keep all thy native good, and naturalize All forrain of that name; but scorn their ill: Embrace their activenesse, not vanities. Who follows all things, forfeiteth his will. If thou observest strangers in each fit, In time they'l runne thee out of all thy wit. Affect in things about thee cleanlinesse, That all may gladly board thee, as a flowre. Slovens take up their stock of noisomnesse Beforehand, and anticipate their last houre. Let thy mindes sweetnesse have his operation Upon thy body, clothes, and habitation. In Almes regard thy means, and others merit. Think heav'n a better bargain, then to give Onely thy single market-money for it. Joyn hands with God to make a man to live. Give to all something; to a good poore man, Till thou change names, and be where he began. Man is Gods image; but a poore man is Christs stamp to boot: both images regard. God reckons for him, counts the favour his: Write, So much giv'n to God; thou shalt be heard. Let thy almes go before, and keep heav'ns gate Open for thee; or both may come too late. Restore to God his due in tithe and time: A tithe purloin'd cankers the whole estate. Sundaies observe: think when the bells do chime, 'Tis angels musick; therefore come not late. God then deals blessings: If a king did so, Who would not haste, nay give, to see the show? Twice on the day his due is understood; For all the week thy food so oft he gave thee. Thy cheere is mended; bate not of the food, Because 'tis better, and perhaps may save thee. Thwart not th'Almighty God: O be not crosse. Fast when thou wilt; but then 'tis gain, not losse. Though private prayer be a brave designe, Yet publick hath more promises, more love: And love's a weight to hearts, to eies a signe. We all are but cold suitours; let us move Where it is warmest. Leave thy six and seven; Pray with the most: for where most pray, is heaven. When once thy foot enters the church, be bare. God is more there, then thou: for thou art there Onely by his permission. Then beware, And make thy self all reverence and fear. Kneeling ne're spoil'd silk stocking: quit thy state. All equall are within the churches gate. Resort to sermons, but to prayers most: Praying's the end of preaching. O be drest; Stay not for th'other pin: why thou hast lost A joy for it worth worlds. Thus hell doth jest Away thy blessings, and extreamly flout thee, Thy clothes being fast, but thy soul loose about thee. In time of service seal up both thine eies, And send them to thine heart; that spying sinne, They may weep out the stains by them did rise: Those doores being shut, all by the eare comes in. Who marks in church-time others symmetrie, Makes all their beautie his deformitie. Let vain or busie thoughts have there no part: Bring not thy plough, thy plots, thy pleasures thither. Christ purg'd his temple; so must thou thy heart. All worldly thoughts are but theeves met together To couzin thee. Look to thy actions well: For churches are either our heav'n or hell. Judge not the preacher; for he is thy Judge: If thou mislike him, thou conceiv'st him not. God calleth preaching folly. Do not grudge To pick out treasures from an earthen pot. The worst speak something good: if all want sense, God takes a text, and preacheth patience. He that gets patience, and the blessing which Preachers conclude with, hath not lost his pains. He that by being at church escapes the ditch, Which he might fall in by companions, gains. He that loves Gods abode, and to combine With saints on earth, shall one day with them shine. Jest not at preachers language, or expression: How know'st thou, but thy sinnes made him miscarrie? Then turn thy faults and his into confession: God sent him, whatsoe're he be: O tarry, And love him for his Master: his condition, Though it be ill, makes him no ill Physician. None shall in hell such bitter pangs endure, As those, who mock at Gods way of salvation. Whom oil and balsames kill, what salve can cure? They drink with greedinesse a full damnation. The Jews refused thunder; and we, folly. Though God do hedge us in, yet who is holy? Summe up at night, what thou hast done by day; And in the morning, what thou hast to do. Dresse and undresse thy soul: mark the decay And growth of it: if with thy watch, that too Be down, then winde up both; since we shall be Most surely judg'd, make thy accounts agree. In brief, acquit thee bravely; play the man. Look not on pleasures as they come, but go. Deferre not the least vertue: lifes poore span Make not an ell, by trifling in thy wo. If thou do ill; the joy fades, not the pains: If well; the pain doth fade, the joy remains. [The Church.] Superliminare. Thou, whom the former precepts have Sprinkled and taught, how to behave Thy self in church; approach, and taste The churches mysticall repast. [Avoid profanenesse; come not here] Avoid profanenesse; come not here: Nothing but holy, pure, and cleare, Or that which groneth to be so, May at his perill further go. The Altar. A broken Altar, Lord, thy servant rears, Made of a heart, and cemented with tears, Whose parts are as thy hand did frame; No workmans tool hath touch'd the same. A Heart alone Is such a stone, As nothing but Thy pow'r doth cut. Wherefore each part Of my hard heart Meets in this frame, To praise thy name. That if I chance to hold my peace, These stones to praise thee may not cease. O let thy blessed Sacrifice be mine And sanctifie this Altar to be thine. The Sacrifice. Oh all ye, who passe by, whose eyes and minde To worldly things are sharp, but to me blinde; To me, who took eyes that I might you finde: Was ever grief like mine? The Princes of my people make a head Against their Maker: they do wish me dead, Who cannot wish, except I give them bread: Was ever grief like mine? Without me each one, who doth now me brave, Had to this day been an Egyptian slave. They use that power against me, which I gave: Was ever grief like mine? Mine own Apostle, who the bag did beare, Though he had all I had, did not forbeare To sell me also, and to put me there: Was ever grief, &amp;c. For thirtie pence he did my death devise, Who at three hundred did the ointment prize, Not half so sweet as my sweet sacrifice: Was ever grief, &amp;c. Therefore my soul melts, and my hearts deare treasure Drops bloud (the onely beads) my words to measure: O let this cup passe, if it be thy pleasure: Was ever grief, &amp;c. These drops being temper'd with a sinners tears, A Balsome are for both the Hemispheres: Curing all wounds, but mine; all, but my fears: Was ever grief, &amp;c. Yet my Disciples sleep: I cannot gain One houre of watching; but their drowsie brain Comforts not me, and doth my doctrine stain: Was ever grief like mine? Arise, arise, they come. Look how they runne. Alas! what haste they make to be undone! How with their lanterns do they seek the sunne! Was ever grief, &amp;c. With clubs and staves they seek me, as a thief, Who am the way of truth, the true relief; Most true to those, who are my greatest grief: Was ever grief, &amp;c. Judas, dost thou betray me with a kisse? Canst thou finde hell about my lips? and misse Of life, just as the gates of life and blisse? Was ever grief, &amp;c. See, they lay hold on me, not with the hands Of faith, but furie: yet at their commands I suffer binding, who have loos'd their bands: Was ever grief, &amp;c. All my Disciples flie; fear puts a barre Betwixt my friends and me. They leave the starre, That brought the wise men of the East from farre. Was ever grief, &amp;c. Then from one ruler to another bound They leade me; urging, that it was not sound What I taught: Comments would the text confound Was ever grief, &amp;c. The Priest and rulers all false witnesse seek 'Gainst him, who seeks not life, but is the meek And readie Paschal Lambe of this great week: Was ever grief, &amp;c. Then they accuse me of great blasphemie, That I did thrust into the Deitie, Who never thought that any robberie: Was ever grief like mine? Some said, that I the Temple to the floore In three dayes raz'd, and raised as before. Why, he that built the world can do much more: Was ever grief, &amp;c. Then they condemne me all with that same breath, Which I do give them daily, unto death. Thus Adam my first breathing rendereth: Was ever grief, &amp;c. They binde, and leade me unto Herod: he Sends me to Pilate. This makes them agree; But yet their friendship is my enmitie: Was ever grief, &amp;c. Herod and all his bands do set me light, Who teach all hands to warre, fingers to fight, And onely am the Lord of hosts and might: Was ever grief, &amp;c. Herod in judgement sits, while I do stand; Examines me with a censorious hand: I him obey, who all things else command: Was ever grief, &amp;c. The Jews accuse me with despitefulnesse; And vying malice with my gentlenesse, Pick quarrels with their onely happinesse: Was ever grief, &amp;c. I answer nothing, but with patience prove If stonie hearts will melt with gentle love. But who does hawk at eagles with a dove? Was ever grief, &amp;c. My silence rather doth augment their crie; My dove doth back into my bosome flie, Because the raging waters still are high: Was ever grief like mine? Heark how they crie aloud still, Crucifie: It is not fit he live a day, they crie, Who cannot live lesse then eternally: Was ever grief, &amp;c. Pilate a stranger holdeth off; but they, Mine own deare people, cry, Away, away, With noises confused frighting the day: Was ever grief, &amp;c. Yet still they shout, and crie, and stop their eares, Putting my life among their sinnes and fears, And therefore wish my bloud on them and theirs: Was ever grief, &amp;c. See how spite cankers things. These words aright Used, and wished, are the whole worlds light: But hony is their gall, brightnesse their night: Was ever grief, &amp;c. They choose a murderer, and all agree In him to do themselves a courtesie: For it was their own cause who killed me: Was ever grief, &amp;c. And a seditious murderer he was: But I the Prince of peace; peace that doth passe All understanding, more then heav'n doth glasse: Was ever grief, &amp;c. Why, Cesar is their onely King, not I: He clave the stonie rock, when they were drie; But surely not their hearts, as I well trie: Was ever grief, &amp;c. Ah! how they scourge me! yet my tendernesse Doubles each lash: and yet their bitternesse Windes up my grief to a mysteriousnesse. Was ever grief like mine? They buffet me, and box me as they list, Who grasp the earth and heaven with my fist, And never yet, whom I would punish, miss'd; Was ever grief, &amp;c. Behold, they spit on me in scornfull wise, Who by my spittle gave the blinde man eies, Leaving his blindnesse to mine enemies: Was ever grief, &amp;c. My face they cover, though it be divine. As Moses face was vailed, so is mine, Lest on their double-dark souls either shine: Was ever grief, &amp;c. Servants and abjects flout me; they are wittie: Now prophesie who strikes thee, is their dittie. So they in me denie themselves all pitie: Was ever grief, &amp;c. And now I am deliver'd unto death, Which each one cals for so with utmost breath, That he before me well nigh suffereth: Was ever grief, &amp;c. Weep not, deare friends, since I for both have wept When all my tears were bloud, the while you slept: Your tears for your own fortunes should be kept: Was ever grief, &amp;c. The souldiers lead me to the common hall; There they deride me, they abuse me all: Yet for twelve heav'nly legions I could call: Was ever grief, &amp;c. Then with a scarlet robe they me aray; Which shews my bloud to be the onely way, And cordiall left to repair mans decay: Was ever grief like mine? Then on my head a crown of thorns I wear: For these are all the grapes Sion doth bear, Though I my vine planted and watred there: Was ever grief, &amp;c. So sits the earths great curse in Adams fall Upon my head: so I remove it all From th'earth unto my brows, and bear the thrall: Was ever grief, &amp;c. Then with the reed they gave to me before, They strike my head, the rock from whence all store Of heav'nly blessings issue evermore: Was ever grief, &amp;c. They bow their knees to me, and cry, Hail king: What ever scoffes or scornfulnesse can bring, I am the floore, the sink, where they it fling: Was ever grief, &amp;c. Yet since mans scepters are as frail as reeds, And thorny all their crowns, bloudie their weeds; I, who am Truth, turn into truth their deeds: Was ever grief, &amp;c. The souldiers also spit upon that face, Which Angels did desire to have the grace, And Prophets once to see, but found no place: Was ever grief, &amp;c. Thus trimmed forth they bring me to the rout, Who Crucifie him, crie with one strong shout. God holds his peace at man, and man cries out: Was ever grief, &amp;c. They leade me in once more, and putting then Mine own clothes on, they leade me out agen. Whom devils flie, thus is he toss'd of men: Was ever grief like mine? And now wearie of sport, glad to ingrosse All spite in one, counting my life their losse, They carrie me to my most bitter crosse: Was ever grief, &amp;c. My crosse I bear my self, untill I faint: Then Simon bears it for me by constraint, The decreed burden of each mortall Saint: Was ever grief, &amp;c. O all ye who passe by, behold and see; Man stole the fruit, but I must climbe the tree; The tree of life to all, but onely me: Was ever grief, &amp;c. Lo, here I hang, charg'd with a world of sinne, The greater world o'th' two; for that came in By words, but this by sorrow I must win: Was ever grief, &amp;c. Such sorrow, as if sinfull man could feel, Or feel his part, he would not cease to kneel, Till all were melted, though he were all steel: Was ever grief, &amp;c. But, O my God, my God! why leav'st thou me, The sonne, in whom thou dost delight to be? My God, my Godâ Never was grief like mine. Shame tears my soul, my bodie many a wound; Sharp nails pierce this, but sharper that confound; Reproches, which are free, while I am bound. Was ever grief, &amp;c. Now heal thy self, Physician; now come down, Alas! I did so, when I left my crown And fathers smile for you, to feel his frown: Was ever grief like mine? In healing not my self, there doth consist All that salvation, which ye now resist; Your safetie in my sicknesse doth subsist: Was ever grief, &amp;c. Betwixt two theeves I spend my utmost breath, As he that for some robberie suffereth. Alas! what have I stollen from you? death: Was ever grief, &amp;c. A king my title is, prefixt on high; Yet by my subjects am condemn'd to die A servile death in servile companie: Was ever grief, &amp;c. They gave me vineger mingled with gall, But more with malice: yet, when they did call, With Manna, Angels food, I fed them all: Was ever grief, &amp;c. They part my garments, and by lot dispose My coat, the type of love, which once cur'd those Who sought for help, never malicious foes: Was ever grief, &amp;c. Nay, after death their spite shall further go; For they will pierce my side, I full well know; That as sinne came, so Sacraments might flow: Was ever grief, &amp;c. But now I die; now all is finished. My wo, mans weal: and now I bow my head. Onely let others say, when I am dead, Never was grief like mine? The Thanksgiving. Oh King of grief! (a title strange, yet true, To thee of all kings onely due) Oh King of wounds! how shall I grieve for thee, Who in all grief preventest me? Shall I weep bloud? why thou hast wept such store That all thy body was one doore. Shall I be scourged, flouted, boxed, sold? 'Tis but to tell the tale is told. My God, my God, why dost thou part from me? Was such a grief as cannot be. Shall I then sing, skipping, thy dolefull storie, And side with thy triumphant glorie? Shall thy strokes be my stroking? thorns, my flower? Thy rod, my posie? crosse, my bower? But how then shall I imitate thee, and Copie thy fair, though bloudie hand? Surely I will reuenge me on thy love, And trie who shall victorious prove. If thou dost give me wealth; I will restore All back unto thee by the poore. If thou dost give me honour; men shall see, The honour doth belong to thee. I will not marry; or, if she be mine, She and her children shall be thine. My bosome friend, if he blaspheme thy name, I will tear thence his love and fame. One half of me being gone, the rest I give Unto some Chappell, die or live. As for thy passionâBut of that anon, When with the other I have done. For thy predestination I'le contrive, That three yeares hence, if I survive, I'le build a spittle, or mend common wayes, But mend mine own without delayes. Then I will use the works of thy creation, As if I us'd them but for fashion. The world and I will quarrell; and the yeare Shall not perceive, that I am here. My musick shall finde thee, and ev'ry string Shall have his attribute to sing; That all together may accord in thee, And prove one God, one harmonie. If thou shalt give me wit, it shall appeare, If thou hast giv'n it me, 'tis here. Nay, I will reade thy book, and never move Till I have found therein thy love; Thy art of love, which I'le turn back on thee, O my deare Saviour, Victorie! Then for thy passionâI will do for thatâ Alas, my God, I know not what. The Reprisall. I have consider'd it, and finde There is no dealing with thy mighty passion: For though I die for thee, I am behinde; My sinnes deserve the condemnation. O make me innocent, that I May give a disentangled state and free: And yet thy wounds still my attempts defie, For by thy death I die for thee. Ah! was it not enough that thou By thy eternall glorie didst outgo me? Couldst thou not griefs sad conquests me allow, But in all vict'ries overthrow me? Yet by confession will I come Into the conquest. Though I can do nought Against thee, in thee I will overcome The man, who once against thee fought. The Agonie. Philosophers have measur'd mountains, Fathom'd the depths of seas, of states, and kings, Walk'd with a staffe to heav'n, and traced fountains: But there are two vast, spacious things, The which to measure it doth more behove: Yet few there are that sound them; Sinne and Love. Who would know Sinne, let him repair Unto mount Olivet; there shall he see A man so wrung with pains, that all his hair, His skinne, his garments bloudie be. Sinne is that presse and vice, which forceth pain To hunt his cruell food through ev'ry vein. Who knows not Love, let him assay And taste that juice, which on the crosse a pike Did set again abroach; then let him say If ever he did taste the like. Love is that liquour sweet and most divine, Which my God feels as bloud; but I, as wine. The Sinner. Lord, how I am all ague, when I seek What I have treasur'd in my memorie! Since, if my soul make even with the week, Each seventh note by right is due to thee. I finde there quarries of pil'd vanities, But shreds of holinesse, that dare not venture To shew their face, since crosse to thy decrees. There the circumference earth is, heav'n the centre. In so much dregs the quintessence is small: The spirit and good extract of my heart Comes to about the many hundredth part. Yet Lord restore thine image, heare my call: And though my hard heart scarce to thee can grone, Remember that thou once didst write in stone. Good Friday. O my chief good, How shall I measure out thy bloud? How shall I count what thee befell, And each grief tell? Shall I thy woes Number according to thy foes? Or, since one starre show'd thy first breath, Shall all thy death? Or shall each leaf, Which falls in Autumne, score a grief? Or cannot leaves, but fruit, be signe Of the true vine? Then let each houre Of my whole life one grief devoure; That thy distresse through all may runne, And be my sunne. Or rather let My severall sinnes their sorrows get; That as each beast his cure doth know, Each sinne may so. Since bloud is fittest, Lord, to write Thy sorrows in, and bloudie fight; My heart hath store, write there, where in One box doth lie both ink and sinne: That when sinne spies so many foes, Thy whips, thy nails, thy wounds, thy woes, All come to lodge there, sinne may say, No room for me, and flie away. Sinne being gone, oh fill the place, And keep possession with thy grace; Lest sinne take courage and return, And all the writings blot or burn. Redemption. Having been tenant long to a rich Lord, Not thriving, I resolved to be bold, And make a suit unto him, to afford A new small-rented lease, and cancell th'old. In heaven at his manour I him sought: They told me there, that he was lately gone About some land, which he had dearly bought Long since on earth, to take possession. I straight return'd, and knowing his great birth, Sought him accordingly in great resorts; In cities, theatres, gardens, parks, and courts: At length I heard a ragged noise and mirth Of theeves and murderers: there I him espied, Who straight, Your suit is granted, said, &amp; died. Sepulchre. O blessed bodie! Whither art thou thrown? No lodging for thee, but a cold hard stone? So many hearts on earth, and yet not one Receive thee? Sure there is room within our hearts good store; For they can lodge transgressions by the score: Thousands of toyes dwell there, yet out of doore They leave thee. But that which shews them large, shews them unfit. What ever sinne did this pure rock commit, Which holds thee now? Who hath indited it Of murder? Where our hard hearts have took up stones to brain thee, And missing this, most falsly did arraigne thee; Onely these stones in quiet entertain thee, And order. And as of old, the law by heav'nly art Was writ in stone; so thou, which also art The letter of the word, find'st no fit heart To hold thee. Yet do we still persist as we began, And so should perish, but that nothing can, Though it be cold, hard, foul, from loving man Withold thee. Easter. Rise heart; thy Lord is risen. Sing his praise Without delayes, Who takes thee by the hand, that thou likewise With him mayst rise: That, as his death calcined thee to dust, His life may make thee gold, and much more just. Awake, my lute, and struggle for thy part With all thy art. The crosse taught all wood to resound his name, Who bore the same. His streched sinews taught all strings, what key Is best to celebrate this most high day. Consort both heart and lute, and twist a song Pleasant and long: Or since all musick is but three parts vied And multiplied; O let thy blessed Spirit bear a part, And make up our defects with his sweet art. I got me flowers to straw thy way; I got me boughs off many a tree: But thou wast up by break of day, And brought'st thy sweets along with thee. The Sunne arising in the East, Though he give light, &amp; th'East perfume; If they should offer to contest With thy arising, they presume. Can there be any day but this, Though many sunnes to shine endeavour? We count three hundred, but we misse: There is but one, and that one ever. Easter wings. My tender age in sorrow did beginne And still with sicknesses and shame Thou didst so punish sinne, That I became Most thinne. With thee Let me combine, And feel this day thy victorie: For, if I imp my wing on thine, Affliction shall advance the flight in me. Lord, who createdst man in wealth and store, Though foolishly he lost the same, Decaying more and more, Till he became Most poore: With thee O let me rise As larks, harmoniously, And sing this day thy victories: Then shall the fall further the flight in me. H. Baptisme. As he that sees a dark and shadie grove, Stayes not, but looks beyond it on the skie; So when I view my sinnes, mine eyes remove More backward still, and to that water flie, Which is above the heav'ns, whose spring and rent Is in my deare Redeemers pierced side. O blessed streams! either ye do prevent And stop our sinnes from growing thick and wide, Or else give tears to drown them, as they grow. In you Redemption measures all my time, And spreads the plaister equall to the crime: You taught the book of life my name, that so What ever future sinnes should me miscall, Your first acquaintance might discredit all. H. Baptisme. Since, Lord, to thee A narrow way and little gate Is all the passage, on my infancie Thou didst lay hold, and antedate My faith in me. O let me still Write thee great God, and me a childe: Let me be soft and supple to thy will, Small to my self, to others milde, Behither ill. Although by stealth My flesh get on, yet let her sister My soul bid nothing, but preserve her wealth: The growth of flesh is but a blister; Childhood is health. Nature. Full of rebellion, I would die, Or fight, or travell, or denie That thou hast ought to do with me. O tame my heart; It is thy highest art To captivate strong holds to thee. If thou shalt let this venome lurk, And in suggestions fume and work, My soul will turn to bubbles straight, And thence by kinde Vanish into a winde, Making thy workmanship deceit. O smooth my rugged heart, and there Engrave thy rev'rend law and fear; Or make a new one, since the old Is saplesse grown, And a much fitter stone To hide my dust, then thee to hold. Sinne. Lord, with what care hast thou begirt us round! Parents first season us: then schoolmasters Deliver us to laws; they send us bound To rules of reason, holy messengers, Pulpits and sundayes, sorrow dogging sinne, Afflictions sorted, anguish of all sizes, Fine nets and stratagems to catch us in, Bibles laid open, millions of surprises, Blessings beforehand, tyes of gratefulnesse, The sound of glorie ringing in our eares: Without, our shame; within, our consciences; Angels and grace, eternall hopes and fears. Yet all these fences and their whole aray One cunning bosome-sinne blows quite away. Affliction. When first thou didst entice to thee my heart, I thought the service brave: So many joyes I writ down for my part, Besides what I might have Out of my stock of naturall delights, Augmented with thy gracious benefits. I looked on thy furniture so fine, And made it fine to me: Thy glorious houshold-stuffe did me entwine, And 'tice me unto thee. Such starres I counted mine: both heav'n and earth Payd me my wages in a world of mirth. What pleasures could I want, whose King I served? Where joyes my fellows were. Thus argu'd into hopes, my thoughts reserved No place for grief or fear. Therefore my sudden soul caught at the place, And made her youth and fiercenesse seek thy face. At first thou gav'st me milk and sweetnesses; I had my wish and way: My dayes were straw'd with flow'rs and happinesse; There was no moneth but May. But with my yeares sorrow did twist and grow, And made a partie unawares for wo. My flesh began unto my soul in pain, Sicknesses cleave my bones; Consuming agues dwell in ev'ry vein, And tune my breath to grones. Sorrow was all my soul; I scarce beleeved, Till grief did tell me roundly, that I lived. When I got health, thou took'st away my life, And more; for my friends die: My mirth and edge was lost; a blunted knife Was of more use then I. Thus thinne and lean without a fence or friend, I was blown through with ev'ry storm and winde. Whereas my birth and spirit rather took The way that takes the town; Thou didst betray me to a lingring book, And wrap me in a gown. I was entangled in the world of strife, Before I had the power to change my life. Yet, for I threatned oft the siege to raise, Not simpring all mine age, Thou often didst with Academick praise Melt and dissolve my rage. I took thy sweetned pill, till I came neare; I could not go away, nor persevere. Yet left perchance I should too happie be In my unhappinesse, Turning my purge to food, thou throwest me Into more sicknesses. Thus doth thy power crosse-bias me, not making Thine own gift good, yet me from my wayes taking. Now I am here, what thou wilt do with me None of my books will show I reade, and sigh, and wish I were a tree; For sure then I should grow To fruit or shade: at least some bird would trust Her houshold to me, and I should be just. Yet, though thou troublest me, I must be meek; In weaknesse must be stout. Well, I will change the service, and go seek Some other master out. Ah my deare God! though I am clean forgot, Let me not love thee, if I love thee not. Repentance. Lord, I confesse my sinne is great; Great is my sinne. Oh! gently treat With thy quick flow'r, thy momentanie bloom; Whose life still pressing Is one undressing, A steadie aiming at a tombe. Mans age is two houres work, or three: Each day doth round about us see. Thus are we to delights: but we are all To sorrows old, If life be told From what life feeleth, Adams fall. O let thy height of mercie then Compassionate short-breathed men. Cut me not off for my most foul transgression: I do confesse My foolishnesse; My God, accept of my confession. Sweeten at length this bitter bowl, Which thou hast pour'd into my soul; Thy wormwood turn to health, windes to fair weather: For if thou stay, I and this day, As we did rise, we die together. When thou for sinne rebukest man, Forthwith he waxeth wo and wan: Bitternesse fills our bowels; all our hearts Pine, and decay, And drop away, And carrie with them th'other parts. But thou wilt sinne and grief destroy; That so the broken bones may joy, And tune together in a well-set song, Full of his praises, Who dead men raises. Fractures well cur'd make us more strong. Faith. Lord, how couldst thou so much appease Thy wrath for sinne, as when mans sight was dimme, And could see little, to regard his ease, And bring by Faith all things to him? Hungrie I was, and had no meat: I did conceit a most delicious feast; I had it straight, and did as truly eat, As ever did a welcome guest. There is a rare outlandish root, Which when I could not get, I thought it here: That apprehension cur'd so well my foot, That I can walk to heav'n well neare. I owed thousands and much more: I did beleeve that I did nothing owe, And liv'd accordingly; my creditor Beleeves so too, and lets me go. Faith makes me any thing, or all That I beleeve is in the sacred storie: And where sinne placeth me in Adams fall, Faith sets me higher in his glorie. If I go lower in the book, What can be lower then the common manger? Faith puts me there with him, who sweetly took Our flesh and frailtie, death and danger. If blisse had lien in art or strength, None but the wise or strong had gained it: Where now by Faith all arms are of a length; One size doth all conditions fit. A peasant may beleeve as much As a great Clerk, and reach the highest stature. Thus dost thou make proud knowledge bend &amp; crouch While grace fills up uneven nature. When creatures had no reall light Inherent in them, thou didst make the sunne, Impute a lustre, and allow them bright; And in this shew, what Christ hath done. That which before was darkned clean With bushie groves, pricking the lookers eie, Vanisht away, when Faith did change the scene: And then appear'd a glorious skie. What though my bodie runne to dust? Faith cleaves unto it, counting evr'y grain With an exact and most particular trust, Reserving all for flesh again. Prayer. Prayer the Churches banquet, Angels age, Gods breath in man returning to his birth, The soul in paraphrase, heart in pilgrimage, The Christian plummet sounding heav'n and earth; Engine against th'Almightie, sinners towre, Reversed thunder, Christ-side-piercing spear, The six-daies world-transposing in an houre, A kinde of tune, which all things heare and fear; Softnesse, and peace, and joy, and love, and blisse, Exalted Manna, gladnesse of the best, Heaven in ordinarie, man well drest, The milkie way, the bird of Paradise, Church-bels beyond the starres heard, the souls bloud, The land of spices; something understood. The H. Communion. Not in rich furniture, or fine aray, Nor in a wedge of gold, Thou, who from me wast sold, To me dost now thy self convey; For so thou should'st without me still have been, Leaving within mesinne: But by the way of nourishment and strengh Thou creep'st into my breast; Making thy way my rest, And thy small quantities my length; Which spread their forces into every part, Meeting sinnes force and art. Yet can these not get over to my soul, Leaping the wall that parts Our souls and fleshly hearts; But as th'outworks, they may controll My rebel-flesh, and carrying thy name, Affright both sinne and shame. Onely thy grace, which with these elements comes, Knoweth the ready way, And hath the privie key, Op'ning the souls most subtile rooms; While those to spirits refin'd, at doore attend Dispatches from their friend. Give me my captive soul, or take My bodie also thither. Another lift like this will make Them both to be together. Before that sinne turn'd flesh to stone, And all our lump to leaven; A fervent sigh might well have blown Our innocent earth to heaven. For sure when Adam did not know To sinne, or sinne to smother; He might to heav'n from Paradise go, As from one room t'another. Thou hast restor'd us to this ease By this thy heav'nly bloud; Which I can go to, when I please, And leave th'earth to their food. Antiphon. Cho. Let all the world in ev'ry corner sing, My God and King. Vers. The heav'ns are not too high, His praise may thither flie: The earth is not too low, His praises there may grow. Cho. Let all the world in ev'ry corner sing, My God and King. Vers. The church with psalms must shout No doore can keep them out: But above all, the heart Must bear the longest part. Cho. Let all the world in ev'ry corner sing, My God and King. Love I. Immortall Love, authour of this great frame, Sprung from that beautie which can never fade; How hath man parcel'd out thy glorious name, And thrown it on that dust which thou hast made, While mortall love doth all the title gain! Which siding with invention, they together Bear all the sway, possessing heart and brain, (Thy workmanship) and give thee share in neither. Wit fancies beautie, beautie raiseth wit: The world is theirs; they two play out the game, Thou standing by: and though thy glorious name, Wrought our deliverance from th'infernall pit, Who sings thy praise? onely a skarf or glove Doth warm our hands, and make them write of love. [Love] II. Immortall Heat, O let thy greater flame Attract the lesser to it: let those fires, Which shall consume the world, first make it tame, And kindle in our hearts such true desires, As may consume our lusts, and make thee way. Then shall our hearts pant thee; then shall our brain, All her invention on thine Altar lay, And there in hymnes send back thy fire again: Our eies shall see thee, which before saw dust; Dust blown by wit, till that they both were blinde, Thou shalt recover all thy goods in kinde, Who wert disseized by usurping lust: All knees shall bow to thee; all wits shall rise, And praise him who did make and mend our eies. The Temper. How should I praise thee, Lord! how should my rymes Gladly engrave thy love in steel, If what my soul doth feel sometimes, My soul might ever feel! Although there were some fourtie heav'ns, or more, Sometimes I peere above them all; Sometimes I hardly reach a score, Sometimes to hell I fall. O rack me not to such a vast extent; Those distances belong to thee: The world's too little for thy tent, A grave too big for me. Wilt thou meet arms with man, that thou dost stretch A crumme of dust from heav'n to hell? Will great God measure with a wretch? Shall he thy stature spell? O let me, when thy roof my soul hath hid, O let me roost and nestle there: Then of a sinner thou art rid, And I of hope and fear. Yet take thy way; for sure thy way is best: Stretch or contract me thy poore debter: This is but tuning of my breast, To make the musick better. Whether I flie with angels, fall with dust, Thy hands made both, and I am there: Thy power and love, my love and trust Make one place ev'ry where. The Temper. It cannot be. Where is that mightie joy, Which just now took up all my heart? Lord, if thou must needs use thy dart, Save that, and me; or sin for both destroy. The grosser world stands to thy word and art; But thy diviner world of grace Thou suddenly dost raise and race, And ev'ry day a new Creatour art. O fix thy chair of grace, that all my powers May also fix their reverence: For when thou dost depart from hence, They grow unruly, and sit in thy bowers. Scatter, or binde them all to bend to thee: Though elements change, and heaven move, Let not thy higher Court remove, But keep a standing Majestie in me. Jordan. Who sayes that fictions onely and false hair Become a verse? Is there in truth no beautie? Is all good structure in a winding stair? May no lines passe, except they do their dutie Not to a true, but painted chair? Is it no verse, except enchanted groves And sudden arbours shadow course-spunne lines? Must purling streams refresh a lovers loves? Must all be vail'd, while he that reades, divines, Catching the sense at two removes? Shepherds are honest people; let them sing: Riddle who list, for me, and pull for Prime: I envie no mans nightingale or spring; Nor let them punish me with losse of ryme, Who plainly say, My God, My King. Employment. If as a flowre doth spread and die, Thou wouldst extend me to some good, Before I were by frosts extremitie Nipt in the bud; The sweetnesse and the praise were thine; But the extension and the room, Which in thy garland I should fill, were mine At thy great doom. For as thou dost impart thy grace, The greater shall our glorie be. The measure of our joyes is in this place, The stuffe with thee. Let me not languish then, and spend A life as barren to thy praise, As is the dust, to which that life doth tend, But with delaies. All things are busie; onely I Neither bring hony with the bees, Nor flowres to make that, nor the husbandrie To water these. I am no link of thy great chain, But all my companie is a weed. Lord place me in thy consort; give one strain To my poore reed. The H. Scriptures. I. Oh Book! infinite sweetnesse! let my heart Suck ev'ry letter, and a hony gain, Precious for any grief in any part; To cleare the breast, to mollifie all pain. Thou art all health, health thriving, till it make A full eternitie: thou art a masse Of strange delights, where we may wish &amp; take Ladies, look here; this is the thankfull glasse, That mends the lookers eyes: this is the well That washes what it shows. Who can indear Thy praise too much? thou art heav'ns lieger here Working against the states of death and hell. Thou art joyes handsell: heav'n lies flat in thee, Subject to ev'ry mounters bended knee. [The H. Scriptures.] II. Oh that I knew how all thy lights combine, And the configurations of their glorie! Seeing not onely how each verse doth shine, But all the constellations of the storie. This verse marks that, and both do make a motion Unto a third, that ten leaves off doth lie: Then as dispersed herbs do watch a potion, These three make up some Christians destinie: Such are thy secrets, which my life makes good, And comments on thee: for in ev'ry thing Thy words do finde me out, &amp; parallels bring, And in another make me understood. Starres are poore books, &amp; oftentimes do misse: This book of starres lights to eternall blisse. Whitsunday. Listen sweet Dove unto my song, And spread thy golden wings in me; Hatching my tender heart so long, Till it get wing, and flie away with thee. Where is that fire which once descended On thy Apostles? thou didst then Keep open house, richly attended, Feasting all comers by twelve chosen men. Such glorious gifts thou didst bestow, That th'earth did like a heav'n appeare; The starres were coming down to know If they might mend their wages, and serve here. The sunne, which once did shine alone, Hung down his head, and wisht for night, When he beheld twelve sunnes for one Going about the world, and giving light. But since those pipes of gold, which brought That cordiall water to our ground, Were cut and martyr'd by the fault Of those, who did themselves through their side wound Thou shutt'st the doore, and keep'st within; Scarce a good joy creeps through the chink: And if the braves of conqu'ring sinne Did not excite thee, we should wholly sink. Lord, though we change, thou art the same; The same sweet God of love and light: Restore this day, for thy great name, Unto his ancient and miraculous right. Grace. My stock lies dead, and no increase Doth my dull husbandrie improve: O let thy graces without cease Drop from above! If still the sunne should hide his face, Thy house would but a dungeon prove, Thy works nights captives: O let grace Drop from above! The dew doth ev'ry morning fall; And shall the dew out-strip thy dove? The dew, for which grasse cannot call, Drop from above. Death is still working like a mole, And digs my grave at each remove: Let grace work too, and on my soul Drop from above. Sinne is still hammering my heart Unto a hardnesse, void of love: Let suppling grace, to crosse his art, Drop from above. O come! for thou dost know the way. Or if to me thou wilt not move, Remove me, where I need not say, Drop from above. Praise. To write a verse or two, is all the praise, That I can raise: Mend my estate in any wayes, Thou shalt have more. I go to Church; help me to wings, and I Will thither flie; Or, if I mount unto the skie, I will do more. Man is all weaknesse; there is no such thing As Prince or King: His arm is short; yet with a sling He may do more. An herb destill'd, and drunk, may dwell next doore, On the same floore, To a brave soul: Exalt the poore, They can do more. O raise me then! poore bees, that work all day, Sting my delay, Who have a work, as well as they, And much, much more. Affliction. Kill me not ev'ry day, Thou Lord of life; since thy one death for me Is more then all my deaths can be, Though I in broken pay Die over each houre of Methusalems stay. If all mens tears were let Into one common sewer, sea, and brine; What were they all, compar'd to thine? Wherein if they were set, They would discolour thy most bloudy sweat. Thou art my grief alone, Thou Lord conceal it not: and as thou art All my delight, so all my smart: Thy crosse took up in one, By way of imprest, all my future mone. Mattens. I cannot ope mine eyes, But thou art ready there to catch My morning-soul and sacrifice: Then we must needs for that day make a match. My God, what is a heart? Silver, or gold, or precious stone, Or starre, or rainbow, or a part Of all these things, or all of them in one? My God, what is a heart, That thou shouldst it so eye, and wooe, Powring upon it all thy art, As if that thou hadst nothing els to do? Indeed mans whole estate Amounts (and richly) to serve thee: He did not heav'n and earth create, Yet studies them, not him by whom they be. Teach me thy love to know; That this new light, which now I see, May both the work and workman show: Then by a sunne-beam I will climbe to thee. Sinne. O that I could a sinne once see! We paint the devil foul, yet he Hath some good in him, all agree. Sinne is flat opposite to th'Almighty, seeing It wants the good of vertue, and of being. But God more care of us hath had: If apparitions make us sad, By sight of sinne we should grow mad. Yet as in sleep we see foul death, and live: So devils are our sinnes in perspective. Even-song. Blest be the God of love, Who gave me eyes, and light, and power this day, Both to be busie, and to play. But much more blest be God above, Who gave me sight alone, Which to himself he did denie: For when he sees my waies, I dy: But I have got his sonne, and he hath none. What have I brought thee home For this thy love? have I discharg'd the debt, Which this dayes favour did beget? I ranne; but all I brought, was fonie. Thy diet, care, and cost Do end in bubbles, balls of winde; Of winde to thee whom I have crost, But balls of wilde-fire to my troubled minde. Yet still thou goest on, And now with darknesse closest wearie eyes, Saying to man, It doth suffice: Henceforth repose; your work is done. Thus in thy Ebony box Thou dost inclose us, till the day Put our amendment in our way, And give new wheels to our disorder'd clocks. I muse, which shows more love, The day or night: that is the gale, this th'harbour; That is the walk, and this the arbour; Or that the garden, this the grove. My God, thou art all love. Not one poore minute scapes thy breast, But brings a favour from above; And in this love, more then in bed, I rest. Church-monuments. While that my soul repairs to her devotion, Here I intombe my flesh, that it betimes May take acquaintance of this heap of dust; To which the blast of deaths incessant motion, Fed with the exhalation of our crimes, Drives all at last. Therefore I gladly trust My bodie to this school, that it may learn To spell his elements, and finde his birth Written in dustie heraldrie and lines; Which dissolution sure doth best discern, Comparing dust with dust, and earth with earth. These laugh at Ieat, and Marble put for signes, To sever the good fellowship of dust, And spoil the meeting. What shall point out them, When they shall bow, and kneel, and fall down flat To kisse those heaps, which now they have in trust? Deare flesh, while I do pray, learn here thy stemme And true descent; that when thou shalt grow fat, And wanton in thy cravings, thou mayst know, That flesh is but the glasse, which holds the dust That measures all our time; which also shall Be crumbled into dust. Mark here below How tame these ashes are, how free from lust, That thou mayst fit thy self against thy fall. Church-musick. Sweetest of sweets, I thank you: when displeasure Did through my bodie wound my minde, You took me thence, and in your house of pleasure And daintie lodging me assign'd. Now I in you without a bodie move, Rising and falling with your wings: We both together sweetly live and love, Yet say sometimes, God help poore Kings. Comfort, 'Ile die; for if you poste from me, Sure I shall do so, and much more: But if I travell in your companie, You know the way to heavens doore. Church-lock and key. I know it is my sinne, which locks thine eares, And bindes thy hands, Out-crying my requests, drowning my tears; Or else the chilnesse of my faint demands. But as cold hands are angrie with the fire, And mend it still; So I do lay the want of my desire, Not on my sinnes, or coldnesse, but thy will. Yet heare, O God, onely for his blouds sake Which pleads for me: For though sinnes plead too, yet like stones they make, His blouds sweet current much more loud to be. The Church-floore. Mark you the floore? that square &amp; speckled stone Which looks so firm and strong, Is Patience: And th'other black and grave, wherewith each one Is checker'd all along, Humilitie: The gentle rising, which on either hand Leads to the Quire above, Is Confidence: But the sweet cement, which in one sure band Ties the whole frame, is Love And Charitie. Hither sometimes Sinne steals, and stains The marbles neat and curious veins: But all is cleansed when the marble weeps. Sometimes Death, puffing at the doore, Blows all the dust about the floore: But while he thinks to spoil the room, he sweeps. Blest be the Architect, whose art Could build so strong in a weak heart. The Windows. Lord, how can man preach thy eternall word? He is a brittle crazie glasse: Yet in thy temple thou dost him afford This glorious and transcendent place, To be a window, through thy grace. But when thou dost anneal in glasse thy storie, Making thy life to shine within The holy Preachers; then the light and glorie More rev'rend grows, &amp; more doth wine Which else shows watrish, bleak, &amp; thin. Doctrine and life, colours and light, in one When they combine and mingle, bring A strong regard and aw: but speech alone Doth vanish like a staring thing, And in the eare, not conscience ring. Trinitie Sunday. Lord, who hast form'd me out of mud, And hast redeem'd me through thy bloud, And sanctifi'd me to do good; Purge all my sinnes done heretofore: For I confesse my heavie score, And I will strive to sinne no more. Enrich my heart, mouth, hands in me, With faith, with hope, with charitie; That I may runne, rise, rest with thee. Content. Peace mutt'ring thoughts, and do not grudge to keep Within the walls of your own breast: Who cannot on his own bed sweetly sleep, Can on anothers hardly rest. Gad not abroad at ev'ry quest and call Of an untrained hope or passion. To court each place or fortune that doth fall, Is wantonnesse in contemplation. Mark how the fire in flints doth quiet lie, Content and warm t'it self alone: But when it would appeare to others eye, Without a knock it never shone. Give me the pliant minde, whose gentle measure Complies and suits with all estates; Which can let loose to a crown, and yet with pleasure Take up within a cloisters gates. This soul doth span the world, and hang content From either pole unto the centre: Where in each room of the well-furnisht tent He lies warm, and without adventure. The brags of life are but a nine dayes wonder; And after death the fumes that spring From private bodies, make as big a thunder, As those which rise from a huge King. Onely thy Chronicle is lost; and yet Better by worms be all once spent, Then to have hellish moths still gnaw and fret Thy name in books, which may not rent. When all thy deeds, whose brunt thou feel'st alone, Are chaw'd by others pens and tongue; And as their wit is, their digestion, Thy nourisht fame is weak or strong. Then cease discoursing soul, till thine own ground, Do not thy self or friends importune. He that by seeking hath himself once found, Hath euer found a happie fortune. The Quidditie. My God, a verse is not a crown, No point of honour, or gay suit, No hawk, or banquet, or renown, Nor a good sword, nor yet a lute: It cannot vault, or dance, or play; It never was in France or Spain; Nor can it entertain the day With a great stable or demain: It is no office, art, or news, Nor the Exchange, or busie Hall; But it is that which while I use I am with thee, and Most take all. Humilitie. I saw the Vertues sitting hand in hand In sev'rall ranks upon an azure throne, Where all the beasts and fowls by their command Presented tokens of submission. Humilitie, who sat the lowest there To execute their call, When by the beasts the presents tendred were, Gave them about to all. The angrie Lion did present his paw, Which by consent was giv'n to Mansuetude. The fearfull Hare her eares, which by their law Humilitie did reach to Fortitude. The jealous Turkie brought his corall-chain; That went to Temperance, On Justice was bestow'd the Foxes brain, Kill'd in the way by chance. At length the Crow bringing the Peacocks plume, (For he would not) as they beheld the grace Of that brave gift, each one began to fume, And challenge it, as proper to his place, Till they fell out: which when the beasts espied, They leapt upon the throne; And if the Fox had liv'd to rule their side, They had depos'd each one. Humilitie, who held the plume, at this Did weep so fast, that the tears trickling down Spoil'd all the train: then saying, Here it is For which ye wrangle, made them turn their frown Against the beasts: so joyntly bandying, They drive them soon away, And then amerc'd them, double gifts to bring At the next Session-day. Frailtie. Lord, in my silence how do I despise What upon trust Is styled honour, riches, or fair eyes; But is fair dust! I surname them guilded clay, Deare earth, fine grasse or hay; In all, I think my foot doth ever tread Upon their head. But when I view abroad both Regiments; The worlds, and thine: Thine clad with simplenesse, and sad events; The other fine, Full of glorie and gay weeds, Brave language, braver deeds: That which was dust before, doth quickly rise, And prick mine eyes. O brook not this, lest if what even now My foot did tread, Affront those joyes, wherewith thou didst endow, And long since wed My poore soul, ev'n sick of love: It may a Babel prove Commodious to conquer heav'n and thee Planted in me. Constancie. Who is the honest man? He that doth still and strongly good pursue, To God, his neighbour, and himself most true: Whom neither force nor fawning can Unpinne, or wrench from giving all their due. Whose honestie is not So loose or easie, that a ruffling winde Can blow away, or glittering look it blinde: Who rides his sure and even trot, While the world now rides by, now lags behinde. Who, when great trials come, Nor seeks, nor shunnes them; but doth calmly stay, Till he the thing and the example weigh: All being brought into a summe, What place or person calls for, he doth pay. Whom none can work or wooe To use in any thing a trick or sleight, For above all things he abhorres deceit: His words and works and fashion too All of a piece, and all are cleare and straight. Who never melts or thaws At close tentations: when the day is done, His goodnesse sets not, but in dark can runne: The sunne to others writeth laws, And is their vertue; Vertue is his Sunne. Who, when he is to treat With sick folks, women, those whom passions sway, Allows for that, and keeps his constant way: Whom others faults do not defeat; But though men fail him, yet his part doth play. Whom nothing can procure, When the wide world runnes bias, from his will To writhe his limbes, and share, not mend the ill. This is the Mark-man, safe and sure, Who still is right, and prayes to be so still. Affliction. My heart did heave, and there came forth, O God, By that I knew that thou wast in the grief, To guide and govern it to my relief, Making a scepter of the rod: Hadst thou not had thy part, Sure the unruly sigh had broke my heart. But since thy breath gave me both life and shape, Thou knowst my tallies; and when there's assign'd So much breath to a sigh, what's then behinde? Or if some yeares with it escape, The sigh then onely is A gale to bring me sooner to my blisse. Thy life on earth was grief, and thou art still Constant unto it, making it to be A point of honour, now to grieve in me, And in thy members suffer ill. They who lament one crosse, Thou dying dayly, praise thee to thy losse. The Starre. Bright spark, shot from a brighter place, Where beams surround my Saviours face, Canst thou be any where So well as there? Yet, if thou wilt from thence depart, Take a bad lodging in my heart; For thou canst make a debter, And make it better. First with thy fire-work burn to dust Folly, and worse then folly, lust: Then with thy light refine, And make it shine: So disengag'd from sinne and sicknesse, Touch it with thy celestiall quicknesse, That it may hang and move After thy love. Then with our trinitie of light, Motion, and heat, let's take our flight Unto the place where thou Before didst bow. Get me a standing there, and place Among the beams, which crown the face Of him, who dy'd to part Sinne and my heart: That so among the rest I may Glitter, and curle, and winde as they: That winding is their fashion Of adoration. Sure thou wilt joy, by gaining me To flie home like a laden bee Unto that hive of beams And garland-streams. Sunday. O day most calm, most bright, The fruit of this, the next worlds bud, Th'indorsement of supreme delight, Writ by a friend, and with his bloud; The couch of time; cares balm and bay: The week were dark, but for thy light: Thy torch doth show the way. The other dayes and thou Make up one man; whose face thou art, Knocking at heaven with thy brow: The worky-daies are the back-part; The burden of the week lies there, Making the whole to stoup and bow, Till thy release appeare. Man had straight forward gone To endlesse death: but thou dost pull And turn us round to look on one, Whom, if we were not very dull, We could not choose but look on still; Since there is no place so alone, The which he doth not fill. Sundaies the pillars are, On which heav'ns palace arched lies: The other dayes fill up the spare And hollow room with vanities. They are the fruitfull beds and borders In Gods rich garden: that is bare, Which parts their ranks and orders. The Sundaies of mans life, Thredded together on times string, Make bracelets to adorn the wife Of the eternall glorious King. On Sunday heavens gate stands ope; Blessings are plentifull and rife, More plentifull then hope. This day my Saviour rose, And did inclose this light for his: That, as each beast his manger knows, Man might not of his fodder misse. Christ hath took in this piece of ground, And made a garden there for those Who want herbs for their wound. The rest of our Creation Our great Redeemer did remove With the same shake, which at his passion Did th'earth and all things with it move: As Samson bore the doores away, Christs hands, though nail'd, wrought our salvation, And did unhinge that day. The brightnesse of that day We sullied by our foul offence: Wherefore that robe we cast away, Having a new at his expence, Whose drops of bloud paid the full price, That was requir'd to make us gay, And fit for Paradise. Thou art a day of mirth: And where the week-dayes trail on ground, Thy flight is higher, as thy birth. O let me take thee at the bound, Leaping with thee from sev'n to sev'n, Till that we both, being toss'd from earth, Flie hand in hand to heav'n! Avarice. Money, thou bane of blisse, &amp; sourse of wo, Whence com'st thou, that thou art so fresh and fine? I know thy parentage is base and low: Man found thee poore and dirtie in a mine. Surely thou didst so little contribute To this great kingdome, which thou now hast got, That he was fain, when thou wert destitute, To digge thee out of thy dark cave and grot: Then forcing thee, by fire he made thee bright: Nay, thou hast got the face of man; for we Have with our stamp and seal transferr'd our right; Thou art the man, and man but drosse to thee. Man calleth thee his wealth, who made thee rich; And while he digs out thee, falls in the ditch. Anagram. MARY/ARMY How well her name an Army doth present, In whom the Lord of hosts did pitch his tent To all Angels and Saints. Oh glorious spirits, who after all your bands See the smooth face of God, without a frown Or strict commands; Where ev'ry one is king, and hath his crown, If not upon his head, yet in his hands: Not out of envie or maliciousnesse Do I forbear to crave your speciall aid: I would addresse My vows to thee most gladly, blessed Maid, And Mother of my God, in my distresse. Thou art the holy mine, whence came the gold, The great restorative for all decay In young and old; Thou art the cabinet where the jewell lay: Chiefly to thee would I my soul unfold: But now (alas!) I dare not; for our King, Whom we do all joyntly adore and praise, Bids no such thing: And where his pleasure no injunction layes, ('Tis your own case) ye never move a wing. All worship is prerogative, and a flower Of his rich crown, from whom lyes no appeal At the last houre: Therefore we dare not from his garland steal, To make a posie for inferiour power. Although then others court you, if ye know What's done on earth, we shall not fare the worse, Who do not so; Since we are ever ready to disburse, If any one our Masters hand can show. Employment. He that is weary, let him sit. My soul would stirre And trade in courtesies and wit, Quitting the furre To cold complexions needing it. Man is not starre, but a quick coal Of mortall fire: Who blows it not, nor doth controll A faint desire, Let his own ashes choke his soul. When th'elements did for place contest With him, whose will Ordain'd the highest to be best; The earth sat still, And by the others is opprest. Life is a businesse, not good cheer; Ever in warres. The sunne still shineth there or here, Whereas the starres Watch an advantage to appeare. Oh that I were an Orenge-tree, That busie plant! Then should I ever laden be, And never want Some fruit for him that dressed me. But we are still too young or old; The man is gone, Before we do our wares unfold: So we freeze on, Untill the grave increase our cold. Deniall. When my devotions could not pierce Thy silent eares; Then was my heart broken, as was my verse: My breast was full of fears And disorder: My bent thoughts, like a brittle bow, Did flie asunder: Each took his way; some would to pleasures go, Some to the warres and thunder Of alarms. As good go any where, they say, As to benumme Both knees and heart, in crying night and day, Come, come, my God, O come, But no hearing. O that thou shouldst give dust a tongue To crie to thee, And then not heare it crying! all day long My heart was in my knee, But no hearing. Therefore my soul lay out of sight, Untun'd, unstrung: My feeble spirit, unable to look right, Like a nipt blossome, hung Discontented. O cheer and tune my heartlesse breast, Deferre no time; That so thy favours granting my request, They and my minde may chime, And mend my ryme. Christmas. All after pleasures as I rid one day, My horse and I, both tir'd, bodie and minde, With full crie of affections, quite astray; I took up in the next inne I could finde. There when I came, whom found I but my deare, My dearest Lord, expecting till the grief Of pleasures brought me to him, readie there To be all passengers most sweet relief? Thou, whose glorious, yet contracted light, Wrapt in nights mantle, stole into a manger; Since my dark soul and brutish is thy right, Man of all beasts be not thou a stranger: Furnish &amp; deck my soul, that thou mayst have A better lodging, then a rack, or grave. The shepherds sing; and shall I silent be? My God, no hymne for thee? My soul's a shepherd too; a flock it feeds Of thoughts, and words, and deeds, The pasture is thy word: the streams, thy grace Enriching all the place. Shepherd and flock shall sing, and all my powers Out-sing the day-light houres. Then we will chide the sunne for letting night Take up his place and right: We sing one common Lord; wherefore he should Himself the candle hold. I will go searching, till I finde a sunne Shall stay, till we have done; A willing shiner, that shall shine as gladly, As frost-nipt sunnes look sadly. Then we will sing, and shine all our own day, And one another pay: His beams shall cheer my breast, and both so twine, Till ev'n his beams sing, and my musick shine. Ungratefulnesse. Lord, with what bountie and rare clemencie Hast thou redeem'd us from the grave! If thou hadst let us runne, Gladly had man ador'd the sunne, And thought his god most brave; Where now we shall be better gods then he. Thou hast but two rare cabinets full of treasure, The Trinitie, and Incarnation: Thou hast unlockt them both, And made them jewels to betroth The work of thy creation Unto thy self in everlasting pleasure. The statelier cabinet is the Trinitie, Whose sparkling light accesse denies: Therefore thou dost not show This fully to us, till death blow The dust into our eyes: For by that powder thou wilt make us see. But all thy sweets are packt up in the other; Thy mercies thither flock and flow: That as the first affrights, This may allure us with delights; Because this box we know; For we have all of us just such another. But man is close, reserv'd, and dark to thee: When thou demandest but a heart, He cavils instantly. In his poore cabinet of bone Sinnes have their box apart, Defrauding thee, who gavest two for one. Sighs and Grones. O do not use me After my sinnes! look not on my desert, But on thy glorie! then thou wilt reform And not refuse me: for thou onely art The mightie God, but I a sillie worm; O do not bruise me! O do not urge me! For what account can thy ill steward make? I have abus'd thy stock, destroy'd thy woods, Suckt all thy magazens: my head did ake, Till it found out how to consume thy goods: O do not scourge me! O do not blinde me! I have deserv'd that an Egyptian night Should thicken all my powers; because my lust Hath still sow'd fig-leaves to exclude thy light: But I am frailtie, and already dust; O do not grinde me! O do not fill me With the turn'd viall of thy bitter wrath! For thou hast other vessels full of bloud, A part wherof my Saviour empti'd hath, Ev'n unto death: since he di'd for my good, O do not kill me! But O reprieve me! For thou hast life and death at thy command; Thou art both Judge and Saviour, feast and rod, Cordiall and Corrosive: put not thy hand Into the bitter box; but O my God, My God, relieve me! The World. Love built a stately house; where Fortune came, And spinning phansies, she was heard to say, That her fine cobwebs did support the frame, Whereas they were supported by the same: But Wisdome quickly swept them all away. Then Pleasure came, who liking not the fashion, Began to make Balcones, Terraces, Till she had weakned all by alteration: But rev'rend laws, and many a proclamation Reformed all at length with menaces. Then enter'd Sinne, and with that Sycomore, Whose leaves first sheltred man from drought &amp; dew, Working and winding slily evermore, The inward walls and Sommers cleft and tore: But Grace shor'd these, and cut that as it grew. Then Sinne combin'd with Death in a firm band To rase the building to the very floore: Which they effected, none could them withstand. But Love and Grace took Glorie by the hand, And built a braver Palace then before. Our life is hid with Christ in God. Coloss. 3. 3. My words &amp; thoughts do both expresse this notion, That Life hath with the sun a double motion. The first Is straight, and our diurnall friend, The other Hid, and doth obliquely bend. One life is wrapt In flesh, and tends to earth. The other winds towards Him, whose happie birth Taught me to live here so, That still one eye Should aim and shoot at that which Is on high: Quitting with daily labour all My pleasure, To gain at harvest an eternall Treasure. Vanitie. The fleet Astronomer can bore, And thred the spheres with his quick-piercing minde: He views their stations, walks from doore to doore, Surveys, as if he had design'd To make a purchase there: he sees their dances, And knoweth long before, Both their full-ey'd aspects, and secret glances. The nimble Diver with his side Cuts through the working waves, that he may fetch His dearely-earned pearl, which God did hide On purpose from the ventrous wretch; That he might save his life, and also hers, Who with excessive pride Her own destruction and his danger wears. The subtil Chymick can devest And strip the creature naked, till he finde The callow principles within their nest: There he imparts to them his minde, Admitted to their bed-chamber, before They appeare trim and drest To ordinarie suitours at the doore. What hath not man sought out and found, But his deare God? who yet his glorious law Embosomes in us, mellowing the ground With showres and frosts, with love &amp; aw, So that we need not say, Where's this command? Poore man, thou searchest round To finde out death, but missest life at hand. Lent. Welcome deare feast of Lent: who loves not thee, He loves not Temperance, or Authoritie, But is compos'd of passion. The Scriptures bid us fast; the Church sayes, now: Give to thy Mother, what thou wouldst allow To ev'ry Corporation. The humble soul compos'd of love and fear Begins at home, and layes the burden there, When doctrines disagree. He sayes, in things which use hath justly got, I am a scandall to the Church, and not The Church is so to me. True Christians should be glad of an occasion To use their temperance, seeking no evasion, When good is seasonable; Unlesse Authoritie, which should increase The obligation in us, make it lesse, And Power it self disable. Besides the cleannesse of sweet abstinence, Quick thoughts and motions at a small expense, A face not fearing light: Whereas in fulnesse there are sluttish fumes, Sowre exhalations, and dishonest rheumes, Revenging the delight. Then those same pendant profits, which the spring And Easter intimate, enlarge the thing, And goodnesse of the deed. Neither ought other mens abuse of Lent Spoil the good use; left by that argument We forfeit all our Creed. It's true, we cannot reach Christs forti'th day; Yet to go part of that religious way, Is better then to rest: We cannot reach our Saviours puritie; Yet are we bid, Be holy ev'n as he. In both let's do our best. Who goeth in the way which Christ hath gone, Is much more sure to meet with him, then one That travelleth by-wayes; Perhaps my God, though he be farre before, May turn, and take me by the hand, and more May strengthen my decayes. Yet Lord instruct us to improve our fast By starving sinne and taking such repast, As may our faults controll: That ev'ry man may revell at his doore, Not in his parlour; banquetting the poore, And among those his soul. Vertue. Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright, The bridall of the earth and skie: The dew shall weep thy fall to night; For thou must die. Sweet rose, whose hue angrie and brave Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye: Thy root is ever in its grave, And thou must die. Sweet spring, full of sweet dayes and roses, A box where sweets compacted lie; My musick shows ye have your closes, And all must die. Onely a sweet and vertuous soul, Like season'd timber, never gives; But though the whole world turn to coal, Then chiefly lives. The Pearl. Matth. 13. I know the wayes of learning; both the head And pipes that feed the presse, and make it runne; What reason hath from nature borrowed, Or of it self, like a good huswife, spunne In laws and policie; what the starres conspire, What willing nature speaks, what forc'd by fire; Both th'old discoveries, and the new-found seas, The stock and surplus, cause and historie: All these stand open, or I have the keyes: Yet I love thee. I know the wayes of honour, what maintains The quick returns of courtesie and wit: In vies of favours whether partie gains, When glorie swells the heart, and moldeth it To all expressions both of hand and eye, Which on the world a true-love-knot may tie, And bear the bundle, wheresoe're it goes: How many drammes of spirit there must be To sell my life unto my friends or foes: Yet I love thee. I know the wayes of pleasure, the sweet strains, The lullings and the relishes of it; The propositions of hot bloud and brains; What mirth and musick mean; what love and wit Have done these twentie hundred yeares, and more: I know the projects of unbridled store: My stuffe is flesh, not brasse; my senses live, And grumble oft, that they have more in me Then he that curbs them, being but one to five: Yet I love thee. I know all these, and have them in my hand: Therefore not sealed, but with open eyes I flie to thee, and fully understand Both the main sale, and the commodities; And at what rate and price I have thy love; With all the circumstances that may move: Yet through the labyrinths, not my groveling wit, But thy silk twist let down from heav'n to me, Did both conduct and teach me, how by it To climbe to thee. Affliction. Broken in pieces all asunder, Lord, hunt me not, A thing forgot, Once a poore creature, now a wonder, A wonder tortur'd in the space Betwixt this world and that of grace. My thoughts are all a case of knives, Wounding my heart With scatter'd smart, As watring pots give flowers their lives. Nothing their furie can controll, While they do wound and prick my soul. All my attendants are at strife, Quitting their place Unto my face: Nothing performs the task of life: The elements are let loose to fight, And while I live, trie out their right. Oh help, my God! let not their plot Kill them and me, And also thee, Who art my life: dissolve the knot, As the sunne scatters by his light All the rebellions of the night. Then shall those powers, which work for grief, Enter thy pay, And day by day Labour thy praise, and my relief, With care and courage building me, Till I reach heav'n, and much more thee. Man. My God, I heard this day, That none doth build a stately habitation, But he that means to dwell therein. What house more stately hath there been, Or can be, then is Man? to whose creation All things are in decay. For Man is ev'ry thing, And more: He is a tree, yet bears no fruit; A beast, yet is, or should be more: Reason and speech we onely bring. Parrats may thank us, if they are not mute, They go upon the score. Man is all symmetrie, Full of proportions, one limbe to another, And all to all the world besides: Each part may call the farthest, brother: For head with foot hath private amitie, And both with moons and tides. Nothing hath got so farre, But Man hath caught and kept it, as his prey. His eyes dismount the highest starre: He is in little all the sphere. Herbs gladly cure our flesh; because that they Finde their acquaintance there. For us the windes do blow, The earth doth rest, heav'n move, and fountains flow. Nothing we see, but means our good, As our delight, or as our treasure: The whole is, either our cupboard of food, Or cabinet of pleasure. The starres have us to bed; Night draws the curtain, which the sunne withdraws; Musick and light attend our head. All things unto our flesh are kinde In their descent and being; to our minde In their ascent and cause. Each thing is full of dutie: Waters united are our navigation; Distinguished, our habitation; Below, our drink; above, our meat; Both are our cleanlinesse. Hath one such beautie? Then how are all things neat? More servants wait on Man, Then he'l take notice of: in ev'ry path He treads down that which doth befriend him, When sicknesse makes him pale and wan. Oh mightie love! Man is one world, and hath Another to attend him. Since then, my God, thou hast So brave a Palace built; O dwell in it, That it may dwell with thee at last! Till then, afford us so much wit; That, as the world serves us, we may serve thee, And both thy servants be. Antiphon. Chor. Praised be the God of love, Men. Here below, Angels. And here above: Cho. Who hath dealt his mercies so, Ang. To his friend, Men. And to his foe; Cho. That both grace and glorie tend Ang. Us of old, Men. And us in th'end. Cho. The great shepherd of the fold Ang. Us did make, Men. For us was sold. Cho. He our foes in pieces brake; Ang. Him we touch; Men. And him we take. Cho. Wherefore since that he is such, Ang. We adore, Men. And we do crouch. Cho. Lord, thy praises should be more. Men. We have none, Ang. And we no store. Cho. Praised be the God alone, Who hath made of two folds one. Unkindnesse. Lord, make me coy and tender to offend: In friendship, first I think, if that agree, Which I intend, Unto my friends intent and end. I would not use a friend, as I use Thee. If any touch my friend, or his good name; It is my honour and my love to free His blasted fame From the least spot or thought of blame, I could not use a friend, as I use Thee. My friend may spit upon my curious floore: Would he have gold? I lend it instantly; But let the poore, And thou within them starve at doore, I cannot use a friend, as I use Thee. When that my friend pretendeth to a place, I quit my interest, and leave it free: But when thy grace Sues for my heart, I thee displace, Nor would I use a friend, as I use Thee. Yet can a friend what thou hast done fulfill? O write in brasse, My God upon a tree His bloud did spill Onely to purchase my good-will: Yet use I not my foes, as I use thee. Life. I made a posie, while the day ran by: Here will I smell my remnant out, and tie My life within this band. But time did becken to the flowers, and they By noon most cunningly did steal away, And wither'd in my hand. My hand was next to them, and then my heart: I took, without more thinking, in good part Times gentle admonition: Who did so sweetly deaths sad taste convey, Making my minde to smell my fatall day; Yet sugring the suspicion. Farewell deare flowers, sweetly your time ye spent, Fit, while ye liv'd, for smell or ornament, And after death for cures. I follow straight without complaints or grief, Since if my sent be good, I care not, if It be as short as yours. Submission. But that thou art my wisdome, Lord, And both mine eyes are thine, My minde would be extreamly stirr'd For missing my designe. Were it not better to bestow Some place and power on me? Then should thy praises with me grow, And share in my degree. But when I thus dispute and grieve, I do resume my sight, And pilfring what I once did give, Disseize thee of thy right. How know I, if thou shouldst me raise, That I should then raise thee? Perhaps great places and thy praise Do not so well agree. Wherefore unto my gift I stand; I will no more advise: Onely do thou lend me a hand, Since thou hast both mine eyes. Justice. I cannot skill of these thy wayes. Lord, thou didst make me, yet thou woundest me; Lord, thou dost wound me, yet thou dost relieve me: Lord, thou relievest, yet I die by thee: Lord, thou dost kill me, yet thou dost reprieve me. But when I mark my life and praise, Thy justice me most fitly payes: For, I do praise thee, yet I praise thee not: My prayers mean thee, yet my prayers stray: I would do well, yet sinne the hand hath got: My soul doth love thee, yet it loves delay. I cannot skill of these my wayes. Charms and Knots. Who reade a chapter when they rise, Shall ne're be troubled with ill eyes. A poore mans rod, when thou dost ride, Is both a weapon and a guide. Who shuts his hand, hath lost his gold: Who opens it, hath it twice told. Who goes to bed and doth not pray, Maketh two nights to ev'ry day. Who by aspersions throw a stone At th'head of others, hit their own. Who looks on ground with humble eyes, Findes himself there, and seeks to rise. When th'hair is sweet through pride or lust, The powder doth forget the dust. Take one from ten, and what remains? Ten still, if sermons go for gains. In shallow waters heav'n doth show; But who drinks on, to hell may go. Affliction. My God, I read this day, That planted Paradise was not so firm, As was and is thy floting Ark; whose stay And anchor thou art onely, to confirm And strengthen it in ev'ry age, When waves do rise, and tempests rage. At first we liv'd in pleasure; Thine own delights thou didst to us impart: When we grew wanton, thou didst use displeasure To make us thine: yet that we might not part, As we at first did board with thee, Now thou wouldst taste our miserie. There is but joy and grief; If either will convert us, we are thine: Some Angels us'd the first; if our relief Take up the second, then thy double line And sev'rall baits in either kinde Furnish thy table to thy minde. Affliction then is ours; We are the trees, whom shaking fastens more, While blustring windes destroy the wanton bowres, And ruffle all their curious knots and store. My God, so temper joy and wo, That thy bright beams may tame thy bow. Mortification. How soon doth man decay! When clothes are taken from a chest of sweets To swaddle infants, whose young breath Scarce knows the way; Those clouts are little winding sheets, Which do consigne and send them unto death. When boyes go first to bed, They step into their voluntarie graves, Sleep bindes them fast; onely their breath Makes them not dead: Successive nights, like rolling waves, Convey them quickly, who are bound for death. When youth is frank and free, And calls for musick, while his veins do swell, All day exchanging mirth and breath In companie; That musick summons to the knell, Which shall befriend him at the house of death. When man grows staid and wise, Getting a house and home, where he may move Within the circle of his breath, Schooling his eyes; That dumbe inclosure maketh love Unto the coffin, that attends his death. When age grows low and weak, Marking his grave, and thawing ev'ry yeare, Till all do melt, and drown his breath When he would speak; A chair or litter shows the biere, Which shall convey him to the house of death. Man, ere he is aware, Hath put together a solemnitie, And drest his herse, while he has breath As yet to spare: Yet Lord; instruct us so to die, That all these dyings may be life in death. Decay. Sweet were the dayes, when thou didst lodge with Lot, Struggle with Jacob, sit with Gideon, Advise with Abraham, when thy power could not Encounter Moses strong complaints and mone: Thy words were then, Let me alone. One might have sought and found thee presently At some fair oak, or bush, or cave, or well: Is my God this way? No, they would reply: He is to Sinai gone, as we heard tell: List, ye may heare great Aarons bell. But now thou dost thy self immure and close In some one corner of a feeble heart: Where yet both Sinne and Satan, thy old foes, Do pinch and straiten thee, and use much art To gain thy thirds and little part. I see the world grows old, when as the heat Of thy great love once spread, as in an urn Doth closet up it self, and still retreat, Cold sinne still forcing it, till it return, And calling Justice, all things burn. Miserie. Lord, let the Angels praise thy name. Man is a foolish thing, a foolish thing, Folly and Sinne play all his game. His house still burns, and yet he still doth sing, Man is but grasse, He knows it, fill the glasse. How canst thou brook his foolishnesse? Why he'l not lose a cup of drink for thee: Bid him but temper his excesse; Not he: he knows, where he can better be, As he will swear, Then to serve thee in fear. What strange pollutions doth he wed, And make his own? as if none knew, but he. No man shall beat into his head, That thou within his curtains drawn canst see: They are of cloth, Where never yet came moth. The best of men, turn but thy hand For one poore minute, stumble at a pinne: They would not have their actions scann'd, Nor any sorrow tell them that they sinne, Though it be small, And measure not their fall. They quarrell thee, and would give over The bargain made to serve thee: but thy love Holds them unto it, and doth cover Their follies with the wing of thy milde Dove, Not suff'ring those Who would, to be thy foes. My God, Man cannot praise thy name: Thou art all brightnesse, perfect puritie; The sunne holds down his head for shame, Dead with eclipses, when we speak of thee: How shall infection Presume on thy perfection? As dirtie hands foul all they touch, And those things most, which are most pure and fine: So our clay hearts, ev'n when we crouch To sing thy praises, make them lesse divine. Yet either this, Or none thy portion is. Man cannot serve thee; let him go, And serve the swine: there, there is his delight: He doth not like this vertue, no; Give him his dirt to wallow in all night: These Preachers make His head to shoot and ake. Oh foolish man! where are thine eyes? How hast thou lost them in a croud of eares? Thou pull'st the rug, and wilt not rise, No not to purchase the whole pack of starres: There let them shine, Thou must go sleep, or dine. The bird that sees a daintie bowre Made in the tree, where she was wont to sit, Wonders and sings, but not his power Who made the arbour: this exceeds her wit. But Man doth know The spring, whence all things flow: And yet as though he knew it not, His knowledge winks, and lets his humours reigne; They make his life a constant blot, And all the bloud of God to run in vain. Ah wretch! what verse Can thy strange wayes rehearse? Indeed at first Man was a treasure, A box of jewels, shop of rarities, A ring, whose posie was, My pleasure: He was a garden in a Paradise: Glorie and grace Did crown his heart and face. But sinne hath fool'd him. Now he is A lump of flesh, without a foot or wing To raise him to the glimpse of blisse: A sick toss'd vessel, dashing on each thing; Nay, his own shelf: My God, I mean my self. Jordan. When first my lines of heav'nly joyes made mention, Such was their lustre, they did so excell, That I sought out quaint words, and trim invention; My thoughts began to burnish, sprout, and swell, Curling with metaphors a plain intention, Decking the sense, as if it were to sell. Thousands of notions in my brain did runne, Off'ring their service, if I were not sped: I often blotted what I had begunne; This was not quick enough, and that was dead. Nothing could seem too rich to clothe the sunne, Much lesse those joyes which trample on his head. As flames do work and winde, when they ascend, So did I weave my self into the sense. But while I bustled, I might heare a friend Whisper, How wide is all this long pretence? There is in love a sweetnesse readie penn'd: Copie out onely that, and save expense. Prayer. Of what an easie quick accesse, My blessed Lord, art thou! how suddenly May our requests thine eare invade! To shew that state dislikes not easinesse. If I but lift mine eyes, my suit is made: Thou canst no more not heare, then thou canst die. Of what supreme almightie power Is thy great arm which spans the east and west, And tacks the centre to the sphere! By it do all things live their measur'd houre: We cannot ask the thing, which is not there, Blaming the shallownesse of our request. Of what unmeasurable love Art thou possest, who; when thou couldst not die, Wert fain to take our flesh and curse, And for our sakes in person sinne reprove, That by destroying that which ty'd thy purse, Thou mightst make way for liberalitie! Since then these three wait on thy throne, Ease, Power, and Love; I value prayer so, That were I to leave all but one, Wealth, fame, endowments, vertues, all should go; I and deare prayer would together dwell, And quickly gain, for each inch lost, an ell. Obedience. My God, if writings may Convey a Lordship any way Whither the buyer and the seller please; Let it not thee displease, If this poore paper do as much as they. On it my heart doth bleed As many lines, as there doth need To passe it self and all it hath to thee. To which I do agree, And here present it as my speciall deed. If that hereafter Pleasure Cavill, and claim her part and measure, As if this passed with a reservation, Or some such words in fashion; I here exclude the wrangler from thy treasure. O let thy sacred will All thy delight in me fulfill! Let me not think an action mine own way, But as thy love shall sway, Resigning up the rudder to thy skill. Lord, what is man to thee, That thou shouldst minde a rotten tree? Yet since thou canst not choose but see my actions; So great are thy perfections, Thou mayst as well my actions guide, as see. Besides, thy death and bloud Show'd a strange love to all our good: Thy sorrows were in earnest; no faint proffer, Or superficiall offer Of what we might not take, or be withstood. Wherefore I all forgo: To one word onely I say, No: Where in the deed there was an intimation Of a gift or donation, Lord, let it now by way of purchase go. He that will passe his land, As I have mine, may set his hand And heart unto this deed, when he hath read; And make the purchase spread To both our goods, if he to it will stand. How happie were my part, If some kinde man would thrust his heart Into these lines; till in heav'ns court of rolls They were by winged souls Entred for both, farre above their desert! Conscience. Peace pratler, do not lowre: Not a fair look, but thou dost call it foul: Not a sweet dish, but thou dost call it sowre: Musick to thee doth howl. By listning to thy chatting fears I have both lost mine eyes and eares. Pratler, no more, I say: My thoughts must work, but like a noiselesse sphere; Harmonious peace must rock them all the day: No room for pratlers there. If thou persistest, I will tell thee, That I have physick to expell thee. And the receit shall be My Saviours bloud: when ever at his board I do but taste it, straight it cleanseth me, And leaves thee not a word; No, not a tooth or nail to scratch, And at my actions carp, or catch. Yet if thou talkest still, Besides my physick, know there's some for thee: Some wood and nails to make a staffe or bill For those that trouble me: The bloudie crosse of my deare Lord Is both my physick and my sword. Sion. Lord, with what glorie wast thou serv'd of old, When Solomons temple stood and flourished! Where most things were of purest gold; The wood was all embellished With flowers and carvings, mysticall and rare: All show'd the builders, crav'd the seers care. Yet all this glorie, all this pomp and state Did not affect thee much, was not thy aim; Something there was, that sow'd debate: Wherefore thou quitt'st thy ancient claim: And now thy Architecture meets with sinne; For all thy frame and fabrick is within. There thou art struggling with a peevish heart, Which sometimes crosseth thee, thou sometimes it: The fight is hard on either part. Great God doth fight, he doth submit. All Solomons sea of brasse and world of stone Is not so deare to thee as one good grone. And truly brasse and stones are heavie things, Tombes for the dead, not temples fit for thee: But grones are quick, and full of wings, And all their motions upward be; And ever as they mount, like larks they sing; The note is sad, yet musick for a king. Home. Come Lord, my head doth burn, my heart is sick, While thou dost ever, ever stay: Thy long deferrings wound me to the quick, My spirit gaspeth night and day. O shew thy self to me, Or take me up to thee! How canst thou stay, considering the pace The bloud did make, which thou didst waste? When I behold it trickling down thy face, I never saw thing make such haste. O show thy self to me, Or take me up to thee! When man was lost, thy pitie lookt about To see what help in th'earth or skie: But there was none; at least no help without: The help did in thy bosome lie. O show thy, &amp;c. There lay thy sonne: and must he leave that nest, That hive of sweetnesse, to remove Thraldome from those, who would not at a feast Leave one poore apple for thy love? O show thy, &amp;c. He did, he came: O my Redeemer deare, After all this canst thou be strange? So many yeares baptiz'd, and not appeare? As if thy love could fail or change. O show thy, &amp;c. Yet if thou stayest still, why must I stay? My God, what is this world to me? This world of wo? hence all ye clouds, away, Away; I must get up and see. O show thy, &amp;c. What is this weary world; this meat and drink, That chains us by the teeth so fast? What is this woman-kinde, which I can wink Into a blacknesse and distaste? O show thy, &amp;c. With one small sigh thou gav'st me th'other day I blasted all the joyes about me: And scouling on them as they pin'd away, Now come again, said I, and flout me. O show thy self to me, Or take me up to thee! Nothing but drought and dearth, but bush and brake, Which way so-e're I look, I see. Some may dream merrily, but when they wake, They dresse themselves and come to thee. O show thy, &amp;c. We talk of harvests; there are no such things, But when we leave our corn and hay: There is no fruitfull yeare, but that which brings The last and lov'd, though dreadfull day. O show thy, &amp;c. Oh loose this frame, this knot of man untie! That my free soul may use her wing, Which now is pinion'd with mortalitie, As an intangled, hamper'd thing. O show thy, &amp;c. What have I left, that I should stay and grone? The most of me to heav'n is fled: My thoughts and joyes are all packt up and gone, And for their old acquaintance plead. O show thy, &amp;c. Come dearest Lord, passe not this holy season, My flesh and bones and joynts do pray: And ev'n my verse, when by the ryme and reason The word is, Stay, sayes ever, Come. O show thy, &amp;c. The British Church. I joy, deare Mother, when I view Thy perfect lineaments, and hue Both sweet and bright. Beautie in thee takes up her place, And dates her letters from thy face, When she doth write. A fine aspect in fit aray, Neither too mean, nor yet too gay, Shows who is best. Outlandish looks may not compare: For all they either painted are, Or else undrest. She on the hills, which wantonly Allureth all in hope to be By her preferr'd, Hath kiss'd so long her painted shrines, That ev'n her face by kissing shines, For her reward. She in the valley is so shie Of dressing, that her hair doth lie About her eares: While she avoids her neighbours pride, She wholly goes on th'other side, And nothing wears. But dearest Mother, (what those misse) The mean thy praise and glorie is, And long may be. Blessed be God, whose love it was To double-moat thee with his grace, And none but thee. The Quip. The merrie world did on a day With his train-bands and mates agree To meet together, where I lay, And all in sport to geere at me. First, Beautie crept into a rose, Which when I pluckt not, Sir, said she, Tell me, I pray, Whose hands are those? But thou shalt answer, Lord, for me. Then Money came, and chinking still, What tune is this, poore man? said he: I heard in Musick you had skill. But thou shalt answer, Lord, for me. Then came brave Glorie puffing by In silks that whistled, who but he? He scarce allow'd me half an eie. But thou shalt answer, Lord, for me. Then came quick Wit and Conversation And he would needs a comfort be, And, to be short, make an oration. But thou shalt answer, Lord, for me. Yet when the houre of thy designe To answer these fine things shall come; Speak not at large, say, I am thine: And then they have their answer home. Vanitie. Poore silly soul, whose hope and head lies low; Whose flat delights on earth do creep and grow; To whom the starres shine not so fair, as eyes; Nor solid work, as false embroyderies; Heark and beware, lest what you now do measure And write for sweet, prove a most sowre displeasure. O heare betimes, left thy relenting May come too late! To purchase heaven for repenting, Is no hard rate. If souls be made of earthly mold, Let them love gold; If born on high, Let them unto their kindred flie: For they can never be at rest, Till they regain their ancient nest. Then silly soul take heed; for earthly joy Is but a bubble, and makes thee a boy. The Dawning. Awake sad heart, whom sorrow ever drowns; Take up thine eyes, which feed on earth; Unfold thy forehead gather'd into frowns: Thy Saviour comes, and with him mirth: Awake, awake; And with a thankfull heart his comforts take. But thou dost still lament, and pine, and crie; And feel his death, but not his victorie. Arise sad heart; if thou dost not withstand, Christs resurrection thine may be: Do not by hanging down break from the hand, Which as it riseth, raiseth thee: Arise, arise; And with his buriall-linen drie thine eyes: Christ left his grave-clothes, that we might, when grief Draws tears, or bloud, not want an handkerchief. Jesu. Jesu is in my heart, his sacred name Is deeply carved there: but th'other week A great affliction broke the little frame, Ev'n all to pieces: which I went to seek: And first I found the corner, where wasJ, After, where ES, and next where U was graved. When I had got these parcels, instantly I sat me down to spell them, and perceived That to my broken heart he was please you, And to my whole is JESU. Businesse. Canst be idle? canst thou play, Foolish soul who sinn'd to day? Rivers run, and springs each one Know their home, and get them gone: Hast thou tears, or hast thou none? If, poore soul, thou hast no tears; Would thou hadst no faults or fears! Who hath these, those ill forbears. Windes still work: it is their plot, Be the season cold, or hot: Hast thou sighs, or hast thou not? If thou hast no sighs or grones, Would thou hadst no flesh and bones! Lesser pains scape greater ones. But if yet thou idle be, Foolish soul, Who di'd for thee? Who did leave his Fathers throne, To assume thy flesh and bone; Had he life, or had he none? If he had not liv'd for thee, Thou hadst di'd most wretchedly; And two deaths had been thy fee. He so farre thy good did plot, That his own self he forgot. Did he die, or did he not? If he had not di'd for thee, Thou hadst liv'd in miserie. Two lives worse then ten deaths be. And hath any space of breath 'Twixt his sinnes and Saviours death? He that loseth gold, though drosse, Tells to all he meets, his crosse: He that sinnes, hath he no losse? He that findes a silver vein, Thinks on it, and thinks again: Brings thy Saviours death no gain? Who in heart not ever kneels, Neither sinne nor Saviour feels. Dialogue. Sweetest Saviour, if my soul Were but worth the having, Quickly should I then controll Any thought of waving. But when all my care and pains Cannot give the name of gains To thy wretch so full of stains; What delight or hope remains? What (childe) is the ballance thine, Thine the poise and measure? If I say, Thou shalt be mine; Finger not my treasure. What the gains in having thee Do amount to, onely he, Who for man was sold, can see; That transferr'd th'accounts to me. But as I can see no merit, Leading to this favour: So the way to fit me for it, Is beyond my favour. As the reason then is thine; So the way is none of mine: I disclaim the whole designe: Sinne disclaims and I resigne. That is all, if that I could Get without repining; And my clay my creature would Follow my resigning. That as I did freely part With my glorie and desert, Left all joyes to feel all smartâ Ah! no more: thou break'st my heart. Dulnesse. VVhy do I languish thus, drooping and dull, As if I were all earth? O give me quicknesse, that I may with mirth Praise thee brim-full! The wanton lover in a curious strain Can praise his fairest fair; And with quaint metaphors her curled hair Curl o're again. Thou art my lovelinesse, my life, my light, Beautie alone to me: Thy bloudy death and undeserv'd, makes thee Pure red and white. When all perfections as but one appeare, That those thy form doth show, The very dust, where thou dost tread and go, Makes beauties here; Where are my lines then? my approaches? views? Where are my window-songs? Lovers are still pretending, &amp; ev'n wrongs Sharpen their Muse: But I am lost in flesh, whose sugred lyes Still mock me, and grow bold: Sure thou didst put a minde there, if I could Finde where it lies. Lord, cleare thy gift, that with a constant wit I may but look towards thee: Look onely; for to love thee, who can be, What angel fit? Love-joy. As on a window late I cast mine eye, I saw a vine drop grapes with J and C Anneal'd on every bunch. One standing by Ask'd what it meant. I (who am never loth To spend my iudgement) said, It seem'd to me To be the bodie and the letters both Of Joy and Charitie. Sir, you have not miss'd, The man reply'd; It figures JESUS CHRIST. Providence. O sacred Providence, who from end to end Strongly and sweetly movest! shall I write, And not of thee, through whom my fingers bend To hold my quill? shall they not do thee right? Of all the creatures both in sea and land Onely to Man thou hast made known thy wayes, And put the penne alone into his hand, And made him Secretarie of thy praise. Beasts fain would sing; birds dittie to their notes; Trees would be tuning on their native lute To thy renown: but all their hands and throats Are brought to Man, while they are lame and mute. Man is the worlds high-Priest: he doth present The sacrifice for all; while they below Unto the service mutter an assent, Such as springs use that fall, and windes that blow. He that to praise and laud thee doth refrain, Doth not refrain unto himself alone, But robs a thousand who would praise thee fain, And doth commit a world of sinne in one. The beasts say, Eat me: but, if beasts must teach, The tongue is yours to eat, but mine to praise. The trees say, Pull me: but the hand you stretch, Is mine to write, as it is yours to raise. Wherefore, most sacred Spirit, I here present For me and all my fellows praise to thee: And just it is that I should pay the rent, Because the benefit accrues to me. We all acknowledge both thy power and love To be exact; transcendent, and divine; Who dost so strongly and so sweetly move, While all things have their will, yet none but thine. For either thy command, or thy permission Lay hands on all: they are thy right and left. The first puts on with speed and expedition; The other curbs sinnes stealing pace and theft. Nothing escapes them both; all must appeare, And be dispos'd, and dress'd, and tun'd by thee, Who sweetly temper'st all. If we could heare Thy skill and art, what musick would it be! Thou art in small things great, not small in any. Thy even praise can neither rise, nor fall. Thou art in all things one, in each thing many: For thou art infinite in one and all. Tempests are calm to thee; they know thy hand, And hold it fast, as children do their fathers, Which crie and follow. Thou hast made poore sand Check the proud sea, ev'n when it swells and gathers. Thy cupboard serves the world: the meat is set, Where all may reach: no beast but knows his feed. Birds teach us hawking; fishes have their net: The great prey on the lesse, they on some weed. Nothing ingendred doth prevent his meat: Flies have their table spread, ere they appeare. Some creatures have in winter what to eat; Others do sleep, and envie not their cheer. How finely dost thou times and seasons spin, And make a twist checker'd with night and day! Which as it lengthens windes, and windes us in, As bouls go on, but turning all the way. Each creature hath a wisdome for his good. The pigeons feed their tender off-spring, crying, When they are callow; but withdraw their food When they are fledge, that need may teach th? flying. Bees work for man; and yet they never bruise Their masters flower, but leave it, having done, As fair as ever, and as fit to use; So both the flower doth stay, and hony run. Sheep eat the grasse, and dung the ground for more: Trees after bearing drop their leaves for soil: Springs vent their streams, and by expense get store: Clouds cool by heat, and baths by cooling boil. Who hath the vertue to expresse the rare And curious vertues both of herbs and stones? Is there an herb for that? O that thy care Would show a root, that gives expressions! And if an herb hath power, what have the starres? A rose, besides his beautie, is a cure. Doubtlesse our plagues and plentie, peace and warres Are there much surer then our art is sure. Thou hast hid metals: man may take them thence; But at his perill: when he digs the place, He makes a grave; as if the thing had sense, And threatned man, that he should fill the space. Ev'n poysons praise thee. Should a thing be lost? Should creatures want for want of heed their due? Since where are poysons, antidots are most: The help stands close, and keeps the fear in view. The sea, which seems to stop the traveller, Is by a ship the speedier passage made. The windes, who think they rule the mariner, Are rul'd by him, and taught to serve his trade. And as thy house is full, so I adore Thy curious art in marshalling thy goods. The hills with health abound; the vales with store; The South with marble; North with furres &amp; woods. Hard things are glorious; easie things good cheap. The common all men have; that which is rare, Men therefore seek to have, and care to keep. The healthy frosts with summer-fruits compare. Light without winde is glasse: warm without weight Is wooll and furres: cool without closenesse, shade: Speed without pains, a horse: tall without height, A servile hawk: low without losse, a spade. All countreys have enough to serve their need: If they seek fine things, thou dost make them run For their offence; and then dost turn their speed To be commerce and trade from sunne to sunne. Nothing wears clothes, but Man; nothing doth need But he to wear them. Nothing useth fire, But Man alone, to show his heav'nly breed: And onely he hath fuell in desire. When th'earth was dry, thou mad'st a sea of wet: Wh? that lay gather'd, thou didst broach the mo?tains: When yet some places could no moisture get, The windes grew gard'ners, and the clouds good fountains. Rain, do not hurt my flowers; but gently spend Your hony drops: presse not to smell them here: When they are ripe, their odour will ascend, And at your lodging with their thanks appeare. How harsh are thorns to pears! and yet they make A better hedge, and need lesse reparation. How smooth are silks compared with a stake, Or with a stone! yet make no good foundation. Sometimes thou dost divide thy gifts to man, Sometimes unite. The Indian nut alone Is clothing, meat and trencher, drink and kan, Boat, cable, sail and needle, all in one. Most herbs that grow in brooks, are hot and dry. Cold fruits warm kernells help against the winde. The lemmons juice and rinde cure mutually. The whey of milk doth loose, the milk doth binde. Thy creatures leap not, but expresse a feast, Where all the guests sit close, and nothing wants. Frogs marry fish and flesh; bats, bird and beast; Sponges, non-sense and sense; mines, th'earth &amp; plants. To show thou art not bound, as if thy lot Were worse then ours; sometimes thou shiftest hands. Most things move th'under-jaw; the Crocodile not. Most things sleep lying; th'Elephant leans or stands. But who hath praise enough? nay who hath any? None can expresse thy works, but he that knows them: And none can know thy works, which are so many, And so complete, but onely he that owes them. All things that are, though they have sev'rall wayes, Yet in their being joyn with one advise To honour thee: and so I give thee praise In all my other hymnes, but in this twice. Each thing that is, although in use and name It go for one, hath many wayes in store To honour thee; and so each hymne thy fame Extolleth many wayes, yet this one more. Hope. I gave to Hope a watch of mine: but he An anchor gave to me. Then an old prayer-book I did present: And he an optick sent. With that I gave a viall full of tears: But he a few green eares: Ah Loyterer! I'le no more, no more I'le bring: I did expect a ring. Sinnes round. Sorrie I am, my God, sorrie I am, That my offences course it in a ring. My thoughts are working like a busie flame, Untill their cockatrice they hatch and bring: And when they once have perfected their draughts, My words take fire from my inflamed thoughts. My words take fire from my inflamed thoughts, Which spit it forth like the Sicilian hill. They vent the wares, and passe them with their faults, And by their breathing ventilate the ill. But words suffice not, where are lewd intentions: My hands do joyn to finish the inventions. My hands do joyn to finish the inventions: And so my sinnes ascend three stories high, As Babel grew, before there were dissentions. Yet ill deeds loyter not: for they supplie New thoughts of sinning: wherefore, to my shame, Sorrie I am, my God, sorrie I am. Time. Meeting with Time, slack thing, said I, Thy sithe is dull; whet it for shame. No marvell Sir, he did replie, If it at length deserve some blame: But where one man would have me grinde it, Twentie for one too sharp do finde it. Perhaps some such of old did passe, Who above all things lov'd this life; To whom thy sithe a hatchet was, Which now is but a pruning-knife. Christs coming hath made man thy debter, Since by thy cutting he grows better. And in his blessing thou art blest: For where thou onely wert before An executioner at best; Thou art a gard'ner now, and more, An usher to convey our souls Beyond the utmost starres and poles. And this is that makes life so long, While it detains us from our God. Ev'n pleasures here increase the wrong, And length of dayes lengthen the rod. Who wants the place, where God doth dwell, Partakes already half of hell. Of what strange length must that needs be, Which ev'n eternitie excludes! Thus farre Time heard me patiently: Then chasing said, This man deludes: What do I here before his doore? He doth not crave lesse time, but more. Gratefulnesse. Thou that hast giv'n so much to me, Give one thing more, a gratefull heart. See how thy beggar works on thee By art. He makes thy gifts occasion more, And sayes, If he in this be crost, All thou hast giv'n him heretofore Is lost. But thou didst reckon, when at first Thy word our hearts and hands did crave, What it would come to at the worst To save. Perpetuall knockings at thy doore, Tears sullying thy transparent rooms, Gift upon gift, much would have more, And comes. This not withstanding, thou wentst on, And didst allow us all our noise: Nay thou hast made a sigh and grone Thy joyes. Not that thou hast not still above Much better tunes, then grones can make; But that these countrey-aires thy love Did take. Wherefore I crie, and crie again; And in no quiet canst thou be, Till I a thankfull heart obtain Of thee: Not thankfull, when it pleaseth me; As if thy blessings had spare dayes: But such a heart, whose pulse may be Thy praise. Peace. Sweet Peace, where dost thou dwell? I humbly crave, Let me once know. I sought thee in a secret cave, And ask'd, if Peace were there. A hollow winde did seem to answer, No: Go seek elsewhere. I did; and going did a rainbow note: Surely, thought I, This is the lace of Peaces coat: I will search out the matter. But while I lookt, the clouds immediately Did break and scatter. Then went I to a garden, and did spy A gallant flower, The crown Imperiall: Sure, said I, Peace at the root must dwell. But when I digg'd, I saw a worm devoure What show'd so well. At length I met a rev'rend good old man, Whom when for Peace I did demand; he thus began: There was a Prince of old At Salem dwelt, who liv'd with good increase Of flock and fold. He sweetly liv'd; yet sweetnesse did not save His life from foes. But after death out of his grave There sprang twelve stalks of wheat: Which many wondring at, got some of those To plant and set. It prosper'd strangely, and did soon disperse Through all the earth: For they that taste it do rehearse, That vertue lies therein, A secret vertue bringing peace and mirth By flight of sinne. Take of this grain, which in my garden grows, And grows for you; Make bread of it: and that repose And peace which ev'ry where With so much earnestnesse you do pursue, Is onely there. Confession. O what a cunning guest Is this same grief! within my heart I made Closets; and in them many a chest; And like a master in my trade, In those chests, boxes; in each box, a till: Yet grief knows all, and enters when he will. No scrue, no piercer can Into a piece of timber work and winde, As Gods afflictions into man, When he a torture hath design'd. They are too subtill for the subt'llest hearts; And fall, like rheumes, upon the tendrest parts. We are the earth; and they, Like moles within us, heave, and cast about: And till they foot and clutch their prey, They never cool, much lesse give out. No smith can make such locks, but they have keyes: Closets are halls to them; and hearts, high-wayes. Onely an open breast Doth shut them out, so that they cannot enter; Or, if they enter, cannot rest, But quickly seek some new adventure. Smooth open hearts no fastning have; but fiction Doth give a hold and handle to affliction. Wherefore my faults and sinnes, Lord, I acknowledge; take thy plagues away: For since confession pardon winnes, I challenge here the brightest day, The clearest diamond: let them do their best, They shall be thick and cloudie to my breast. Giddinesse. Oh, what a thing is man! how farre from power, From setled peace and rest! He is some twentie sev'rall men at least Each sev'rall houre. One while he counts of heav'n, as of his treasure: But then a thought creeps in, And calls him coward, who for fear of sinne Will lose a pleasure. Now he will fight it out, and to the warres; Now eat his bread in peace, And snudge in quiet: now he scorns increase; Now all day spares. He builds a house, which quickly down must go, As if a whirlwinde blew And crusht the building: and it's partly true, His minde is so. O what a sight were Man, if his attires Did alter with his minde; And like a Dolphins skinne, his clothes combin'd With his desires! Surely if each one saw anothers heart, There would be no commerce, No sale or bargain passe: all would disperse, And live apart. Lord, mend or rather make us: one creation Will not suffice our turn: Except thou make us dayly, we shall spurn Our own salvation. The bunch of grapes. Joy, I did lock thee up: but some bad man Hath let thee out again: And now, me thinks, I am where I began Sev'n yeares ago: one vogue and vein, One aire of thoughts usurps my brain. I did toward Canaan draw; but now I am Brought back to the Red sea, the sea of shame. For as the Jews of old by Gods command Travell'd, and saw no town: So now each Christian hath his journeys spann'd: Their storie pennes and sets us down. A single deed is small renown. Gods works are wide, and let in future times; His ancient justice overflows our crimes. Then have we too our guardian fires and clouds; Our Scripture-dew drops fast: We have our sands and serpents, tents and shrowds; Alas! our murmurings come not last. But where's the cluster? where's the taste Of mine inheritance? Lord, if I must borrow, Let me as well take up their joy, as sorrow. But can he want the grape, who hath the wine? I have their fruit and more. Blessed be God, who prosper'd Noahs vine, And made it bring forth grapes good store. But much more him I must adore, Who of the laws sowre juice sweet wine did make, Ev'n God himself, being pressed for my sake. Love unknown. Deare Friend, sit down, the tale is long and sad: And in my faintings I presume your loue Will more complie, then help. A Lord I had, And have, of whom some grounds which may improve, I hold for two lives, aud both lives in me. To him I brought a dish of fruit one day, And in the middle plac'd my heart. But he (I sigh to say) Lookt on a seruant, who did know his eye Better then you know me, or (which is one) Then I my self. The servant instantly Quitting the fruit, seiz'd on my heart alone, And threw it in a font, wherein did fall A stream of bloud, which issu'd from the side Of a great rock: I well remember all, And have good cause: there it was dipt and di'd, And washt, and wrung: the very wringing yet Enforceth tears. Your heart was foul, I fear. Indeed 'tis true. I did and do commit Many a fault more then my lease will bear; Yet still askt pardon, and was not deni'd. But you shall heare. After my heart was well, And clean and fair, as I one even-tide (I sigh to tell) Walkt by my self abroad, I saw a large And spacious fornace flaming, and thereon A boyling caldron, round about whose verge Was in great letters set AFFLICTION. The greatnesse shew'd the owner. So I went To fetch a sacrifice out of my fold, Thinking with that, which I did thus present, To warm his love, which I did fear grew cold. But as my heart did tender it, the man Who was to take it from me, slipt his hand, And threw my heart into the scalding pan; My heart, that brought it (do you understand?) The offerers heart. Your heart was hard, I fear, Indeed 'tis true. I found a callous matter Began to spread and to expatiate there: But with a richer drug, then scalding water, I bath'd it often, ev'n with holy bloud, Which at a board, while many drunk bare wine, A friend did steal into my cup for good, Ev'n taken inwardly, and most divine To supple hardnesses. But at the length Out of the caldron getting, soon I fled Unto my house, where to repair the strength Which I had lost, I hasted to my bed. But when I thought to sleep cut all these faults (I sigh to speak) I found that some had stuff'd the bed with thoughts, I would say thorns. Deare, could my heart not break, When with my pleasures ev'n my rest was gone? Full well I understood, who had been there: For I had giv'n the key to none, but one: It must be he. Your heart was dull, I fear. Indeed a slack and sleepie state of minde Did oft possesse me, so that when I pray'd, Though my lips went, my heart did stay behinde: But all my scores were by another paid, Who took the debt upon him. Truly, Friend, For ought I heare, your Master shows to you More favour then you wot of. Mark the end. The Font did onely, what was old, renew: The Caldron suppled, what was grown too hard: The Thorns did quicken, what was grown too dulls All did but strive to mend, what you had marr'd. Wherefore be cheer'd, and praise him to the full Each day, each houre, each moment of the weeks Who fain would have you be, new, tender, quick. Mans medley. Heark, how the birds do sing, And woods do ring. All creatures have their joy: and man hath his. Yet if we rightly measure, Mans joy and pleasure Rather hereafter, then in present, is. To this life things of sense Make their pretence: In th'other Angels have a right by birth: Man ties them both alone, And makes them one, With th'one hand touching heav'n, with th'other earth. In soul he mounts and flies, In flesh he dies. He wears a stuffe whose thread is course and round, But trimm'd with curious lace, And should take place After the trimming, not the stuffe and ground. Not, that he may not here Taste of the cheer, But as birds drink, and straight lift up their head, So must he sip and think Of better drink He may attain to, after he is dead. But as his joyes are double; So is his trouble. He hath two winters, other things but one: Both frosts and thoughts do nip, And bite his lip; And he of all things fears two deaths alone. Yet ev'n the greatest griefs May be reliefs, Could he but take them right, and in their wayes. Happie is he, whose heart Hath found the art To turn his double pains to double praise. The Storm. If as the windes and waters here below Do flie and flow, My sighs and tears as busie were above; Sure they would move And much affect thee, as tempestuous times Amaze poore mortals, and object their crimes. Starres have their storms, ev'n in a high degree, As well as we. A throbbing conscience spurred by remorse Hath a strange force: It quits the earth, and mounting more and more. Dares to assault thee, and besiege thy doore. There it stands knocking, to thy musicks wrong, And drowns the song. Glorie and honour are set by till it An answer get. Poets have wrong'd poore storms: such dayes are best; They purge the aire without, within the breast. Paradise. I blesse thee, Lord, because I grow Among thy trees, which in a row To thee both fruit and order ow. What open force, or hidden charm Can blast my fruit, or bring me harm, While the inclosure is thine arm? Inclose me still for fear I start, Be to me rather sharp and tart, Then let me want thy hand &amp; art. When thou dost greater judgements spare, And with thy knife but prune and pare, Ev'n fruitfull trees more fruitfull are. Such sharpnes shows the sweetest frend: Such cuttings rather heal then rend: And such beginnings touch their end. The Method. Poore heart, lament. For since thy God refuseth still, There is some rub, some discontent, Which cools his will. Thy Father could Quickly effect, what thou dost move; For he is Power: and sure he would; For he is Love. Go search this thing, Tumble thy breast, and turn thy book. If thou hadst lost a glove or ring, Wouldst thou not look? What do I see Written above there? Yesterday I did behave me carelesly, When I did pray. And should Gods eare To such indifferents chained be, Who do not their own motions heare? Is God lesse free? But stay! what's there? Late when I would have something done, I had a motion to forbear, Yet I went on. And should Gods eare, Which needs not man, be ty'd to those Who heare not him, but quickly heare His utter foes? Then once more pray: Down with thy knees, up with thy voice, Seek pardon first, and God will say, Glad heart rejoyce. Divinitie. As men, for fear the starres should sleep and nod, And trip at night, have spheres suppli'd; As if a starre were duller then a clod, Which knows his way without a guide: Just so the other heav'n they also serve, Divinities transcendent skie: Which with the edge of wit they cut and carve. Reason triumphs, and faith lies by. Could not that wisdome, which first broacht the wine, Have thicken'd it with definitions? And jagg'd his seamlesse coat, had that been fine, With curious questions and divisions? But all the doctrine, which he taught and gave, Was cleare as heav'n, from whence it came. At least those beams of truth, which onely save, Surpasse in brightnesse any flame. Love God, and love your neighbour. Watch and pray. Do as ye would be done unto. O dark instructions; ev'n as dark as day! Who can these Gordian knots undo? But he doth bid us take his bloud for wine. Bid what he please; yet I am sure, To take and taste what he doth there designe, Is all that saves, and not obscure. Then burn thy Epicycles, foolish man; Break all thy spheres, and save thy head. Faith needs no staffe of flesh, but stoutly can To heav'n alone both go, and leade. Grieve not the Holy Spirit, &amp;c. Ephes. 4. 30. And art thou grieved, sweet and sacred Dove, When I am sowre, And crosse thy love? Grieved for me? the God of strength and power Griev'd for a worm, which when I tread, I passe away and leave it dead? Then weep mine eyes, the God of love doth grieve: Weep foolish heart, And weeping live: For death is drie as dust. Yet if ye part, End as the night, whose sable hue Your sinnes expresse; melt into dew. When sawcie mirth shall knock or call at doore, Cry out, Get hence, Or cry no more. Almightie God doth grieve, he puts on sense: I sinne not to my grief alone, But to my Gods too; he doth grone. Oh take thy lute, and tune it to a strain, Which may with thee All day complain. There can no discord but in ceasing be. Marbles can weep; and surely strings More bowels have, then such hard things. Lord, I adjudge my self to tears and grief, Ev'n endlesse tears Without relief. If a cleare spring for me no time forbears, But runnes, although I be not drie; I am no Crystall, what shall I? Yet if I wail not still, since still to wail Nature denies; And flesh would fail, If my deserts were masters of mine eyes: Lord, pardon, for thy sonne makes good My want of tears with store of bloud. The Familie. What doth this noise of thoughts within my heart As if they had a part? What do these loud complaints and pulling fears, As if there were no rule or eares? But, Lord, the house and familie are thine, Though some of them repine. Turn out these wranglers, which defile thy seat: For where thou dwellest all is neat. First Peace and Silence all disputes controll, Then Order plaies the soul; And giving all things their set forms and houres, Makes of wilde woods sweet walks and bowres. Humble Obedience neare the doore doth stand, Expecting a command: Then whom in waiting nothing seems more slow, Nothing more quick when she doth go. Joyes oft are there, and griefs as oft as joyes; But griefs without a noise: Yet speak they louder, then distemper'd fears. What is so shrill as silent tears? This is thy house, with these it doth abound: And where these are not found, Perhaps thou com'st sometimes, and for a day; But not to make a constant stay. The Size. Content thee, greedie heart. Modest and moderate joyes to those, that have Title to more hereafter when they part, Are passing brave. Let th'upper springs into the low Descend and fall, and thou dost flow. What though some have a fraught Of cloves and nutmegs, and in cinamon sail; If thou hast where withall to spice a draught, When griefs prevail; And for the future time art heir To th'Isle of spices? Is't not fair? To be in both worlds full Is more then God was, who was hungrie here. Wouldst thou his laws of fasting disanull? Enact good cheer? Lay out thy joy, yet hope to save it? Wouldst thou both eat thy cake, and have it? Great joyes are all at once; But little do reserve themselves for more: Those have their hopes; these what they have renounce, And live on score: Those are at home; these journey still, And meet the rest on Sions hill. Thy Saviour sentenc'd joy, And in the flesh condemn'd it as unfit, At least in lump: for such doth oft destroy; Whereas a bit Doth tice us on to hopes of more, And for the present health restore. A Christians state and case Is not a corpulent, but a thinne and spare, Yet active strength: whose long and bonie face Content and care Do seem to equally divide, Like a pretender, not a bride. Wherefore sit down, good heart; Grasp not at much, for fear thou losest all. If comforts fell according to desert, They would great frosts and snows destroy: For we should count, Since the last joy. Then close again the seam, Which thou hast open'd: do not spread thy robe In hope of great things. Call to minde thy dream, An earthly globe, On whose meridian was engraven, These seas are tears, and heav'n the haven. Artillerie. As I one ev'ning sat before my cell, Me thoughts a starre did shoot into my lap. I rose, and shook my clothes, as knowing well, That from small fires comes oft no small mishap. When suddenly I heard one say, Do as thou usest, disobey, Expell good motions from thy breast, Which have the face of fire, but end in rest. I, who had heard of musick in the spheres, But not of speech in starres, began to muse: But turning to my God, whose ministers The starres and all things are; If I refuse, Dread Lord, said I, so oft my good; Then I refuse not ev'n with bloud To wash away my stubborn thought: For I will do, or suffer what I ought. But I have also starres and shooters too, Born where thy servants both artilleries use. My tears and prayers night and day do wooe, And work up to thee; yet thou dost refuse. Nor, but I am (I must say still) Much more oblig'd to do thy will, Then thou to grant mine: but because Thy promise now hath ev'n set thee thy laws. Then we are shooters both, and thou dost deigne To enter combate with us, and contest With thine own clay. But I would parley fain: Shunne not my arrows, and behold my breast. Yet if thou shunnest, I am thine: I must be so, if I am mine. There is no articling with thee: I am but finite, yet thine infinitely. Church-rents and schismes. Brave rose, (alas!) where art thou? in the chair Where thou didst lately so triumph and shine, A worm doth sit, whose many feet and hair Are the more foul, the more thou wert divine. This, this hath done it, this did bite the root And bottome of the leaves: which when the winde Did once perceive, it blew them under foot, Where rude unhallow'd steps do crush and grinde Their beauteous glories. Onely shreds of thee, And those all bitten, in thy chair I see. Why doth my Mother blush? is she the rose, And shows it so? Indeed Christs precious bloud Gave you a colour once; which when your foes Thought to let out, the bleeding did you good, And made you look much fresher then before. But when debates and fretting jealousies Did worm and work within you more and more, Your colour faded, and calamities Turned your ruddie into pale and bleak: Your health and beautie both began to break. Then did your sev'rall parts unloose and start: Which when your neighbours saw, like a north-winde, They rushed in, and cast them in the dirt Where Pagans tread. O Mother deare and kinde, Where shall I get me eyes enough to weep, As many eyes as starres? since it is night, And much of Asia and Europe fast asleep, And ev'n all Africk; would at least I might With these two poore ones lick up all the dew, Which falls by night, and poure it out for you! Justice. O dreadfull Justice, what a fright and terrour Wast thou of old, When sinne and errour Did show and shape thy looks to me, And through their glasse discolour thee! He that did but look up, was proud and bold. The dishes of thy ballance seem'd to gape, Like two great pits; The beam and scape Did like some tort'ring engine show: Thy hand above did burn and glow, Danting the stoutest hearts, the proudest wits. But now that Christs pure vail presents the sight, I see no fears: Thy hand is white, Thy scales like buckets, which attend And interchangeably descend, Lifting to heaven from this well of tears. For where before thou still didst call on me, Now I still touch And harp on thee. Gods promises have made thee mine; Why should I justice now decline? Against me there is none, but for me much. The Pilgrimage. I travell'd on, seeing the hill, where lay My expectation. A long it was and weary way. The gloomy cave of Desperation I left on th'one, and on the other side The rock of Pride, And so I came to phansies medow strow'd With many a flower: Fain would I here have made abode, But I was quicken'd by my houre. So to cares cops I came, and there got through With much ado. That led me to the wilde of passion, which Some call the wold; A wasted place, but sometimes rich. Here I was robb'd of all my gold, Save one good Angell, which a friend had ti'd Close to my side. At length I got unto the gladsome hill, Where lay my hope, Where lay my heart; and climbing still, When I had gain'd the brow and top, A lake of brackish waters on the ground Was all I found. With that abash'd and struck with many a sting Of swarming fears, I fell, and cry'd, Alas my King; Can both the way and end be tears? Yet taking heart I rose, and then perceiv'd I was deceiv'd: My hill was further: so I flung away, Yet heard a crie Just as I went, None goes that way And lives: If that be all, said I, After so foul a journey death is fair, And but a chair. The Holdfast. I threatned to observe the strict decree Of my deare God with all my power &amp; might. But I was told by one, it could not be; Yet I might trust in God to be my light. Then will I trust, said I, in him alone. Nay, ev'n to trust in him, was also his: We must confesse, that nothing is our own. Then I confesse that he my succour is: But to have nought is ours, not to confesse That we have nought. I stood amaz'd at this, Much troubled, till I heard a friend expresse, That all things were more ours by being his. What Adam had, and forfeited for all, Christ keepeth now, who cannot fail or fall. Complaining. Do not beguile my heart, Because thou art My power and wisdome. Put me not to shame, Because I am Thy clay that weeps, thy dust that calls. Thou art the Lord of glorie; The deed and storie Are both thy due: but I a silly flie, That live or die According as the weather falls. Art thou all justice, Lord? Shows not thy word More attributes? Am I all throat or eye, To weep or crie? Have I no parts but those of grief? Let not thy wrathfull power Afflict my houre, My inch of life: or let thy gracious power Contract my houre, That I may climbe and finde relief. The Discharge. Busie enquiring heart, what wouldst thou know? Why dost thou prie, And turn, and leer, and with a licorous eye Look high and low; And in thy lookings stretch and grow? Hast thou not made thy counts, and summ'd up all? Did not thy heart Give up the whole, and with the whole depart? Let what will fall: That which is past who can recall? Thy life is Gods, thy time to come is gone, And is his right. He is thy night at noon: he is at night Thy noon alone. The crop is his, for he hath sown. And well it was for thee, when this befell, That God did make Thy businesse his, and in thy life partake: For thou canst tell, If it be his once, all is well. Onely the present is thy part and fee. And happy thou, If, though thou didst not beat thy future brow, Thou couldst well see What present things requir'd of thee. They ask enough; why shouldst thou further go? Raise not the mudde Of future depths, but drink the cleare and good. Dig not for wo In times to come; for it will grow. Man and the present fit: if he provide, He breaks the square. This houre is mine: if for the next I care, I grow too wide, And do encroach upon deaths side. For death each houre environs and surrounds. He that would knew And care for future chances, cannot go Unto those grounds, But through a Church-yard which th? bo?ds. Things present shrink and die: but they that spend Their thoughts and sense On future grief, do not remove it thence, But it extend, And draw the bottome out an end. God chains the dog till night: wilt loose the chain, And wake thy sorrow? Wilt thou forestall it, and now grieve to morrow, And then again Greive over freshly all thy pain? Either grief will not come: or if it must, Do not forecast. And while it cometh, it is almost past. Away distrust: My God hath promis'd, he is just. Praise. King of Glorie, King of Peace, I will love thee: And that love may never cease, I will move thee. Thou hast granted my request, Thou hast heard me: Thou didst note my working breast, Thou hast spar'd me. Wherefore with my utmost art I will sing thee, And the cream of all my heart I will bring thee. Though my sinnes against me cried, Thou didst cleare me; And alone, when they replied, Thou didst heare me. Sev'n whole dayes, not one in seven, I will praise thee. In my heart, though not in heaven, I can raise thee. Thou grew'st soft and moist with tears, Thou relentedst: And when Justice call'd for fears, Thou dissentedst. Small it is, in this poore sort To enroll thee: Ev'n eternitie is too short To extoll thee. An Offering. Come, bring thy gift. If blessings were as slow As mens returns, what would become of fools? What hast thou there? a heart? but is it pure? Search well and see; for hearts have many holes. Yet one pure heart is nothing to bestow: In Christ two natures met to be thy cure. O that within us hearts had propagation, Since many gifts do challenge many hearts! Yet one, if good, may title to a number; And single things grow fruitfull by deserts. In publick judgements one may be a nation, And fence a plague, while others sleep and slumber. But all I fear is lest thy heart displease, As neither good, nor one: so oft divisions Thy lusts have made, and not thy lusts alone; Thy passions also have their set partitions. These parcell out thy heart: recover these, And thou mayst offer many gifts in one. There is a balsome, or indeed a bloud, Dropping from heav'n, which doth both cleanse and close All sorts of wounds; of such strange force it is. Seek out this All-heal, and seek no repose, Untill thou finde and use it to thy good: Then bring thy gift; and let thy hymne be this; Since my sadnesse Into gladnesse, Lord thou dost convert, O accept What thou hast kept, As thy due desert. Had I many, Had I any, (For this heart is none) All were thine And none of mine: Surely thine alone. Yet thy favour May give savour To this poore oblation; And it raise To be thy praise, And be my salvation. Longing. With sick and famisht eyes, With doubling knees and weary bones, To thee my cries, To thee my grones, To thee my sighs, my tears ascend: No end? My throat, my soul is hoarse; My heart is wither'd like a ground Which thou dost curse. My thoughts turn round, And make me giddie; Lord, I fall, Yet call. From thee all pitie flows. Mothers are kinde, because thou art, And dost dispose To them a part: Their infants, them; and they suck thee More free. Bowels of pitie, heare! Lord of my soul, love of my minde, Bow down thine eare! Let not the winde Scatter my words, and in the same Thy name! Look on my sorrows round! Mark well my furnace! O what flames, What heats abound! What griefs, what shames! Consider, Lord; Lord, bow thine eare, And heare! Lord Jesu, thou didst bow Thy dying head upon the tree: O be not now More dead to me! Lord heare! Shall he that made the eare, Not heare? Behold, thy dust doth stirre, It moves, it creeps, it aims at thee: Wilt thou deferre To succour me, Thy pile of dust, wherein each crumme Sayes, Come? To thee help appertains. Hast thou left all things to their course, And laid the reins Upon the horse? Is all lockt? hath a sinners plea No key? Indeed the world's thy book, Where all things have their leafe assign'd: Yet a meek look Hath interlin'd. Thy board is full, yet humble guests Finde nests. Thou tarriest, while I die, And fall to nothing: thou dost reigne, And rule on high, While I remain In bitter grief: yet am I stil'd Thy childe. Lord, didst thou leave thy throne, Not to relieve? how can it be, That thou art grown Thus hard to me? Were sinne alive, good cause there were To bear. But now both sinne is dead, And all thy promises live and bide. That wants his head; These speak and chide, And in thy bosome poure my tears, As theirs. Lord Jesu, heare my heart, Which hath been broken now so long, That ev'ry part Hath got a tongue! Thy beggars grow; rid them away To day. My love, my sweetnesse, heare! By these thy feet, at which my heart Lies all the yeare, Pluck out thy dart, And heal my troubled breast which cryes, Which dyes. The Bag. Away despair; my gracious Lord doth heare. Though windes and waves assault my keel, He doth preserve it: he doth steer, Ev'n when the boat seems most to reel. Storms are the triumph of his art: Well may he close his eyes, but not his heart. Hast thou not heard, that my Lord Jesus di'd? Then let me tell thee a strange storie. The God of power, as he did ride In his majestick robes of glorie, Resolv'd to light; and so one day He did descend, undressing all the way. The starres his tire of light and rings obtain'd, The cloud his bow, the fire his spear, The sky his azure mantle gain'd. And when they ask'd, what he would wear; He smil'd and said as he did go, He had new clothes a making here below. When he was come, as travellers are wont, He did repair unto an inne. Both then, and after, many a brunt He did endure to cancell sinne: And having giv'n the rest before, Here he gave up his life to pay our score. But as he was returning, there came one That ran upon him with a spear. He, who came hither all alone, Bringing nor man, nor arms, nor fear, Receiv'd the blow upon his side, And straight he turn'd, and to his brethren cry'd, If ye have any thing to send or write, (I have no bag, but here is room) Unto my fathers hands and sight (Beleeve me) it shall safely come. That I shall minde, what you impart; Look, you may put it very neare my heart. Or if hereafter any of my friends Will use me in this kinde, the doore Shall still be open; what he sends I will present, and somewhat more, Not to his hurt. Sighs will convey Any thing to me. Heark despair, away. The Jews. Poore nation, whose sweet sap, and juice. Our cyens have purloin'd, and left you drie: Whose streams we got by the Apostles sluce, And use in baptisme, while ye pine and die: Who by not keeping once, became a debter; And now by keeping lose the letter: Oh that my prayers! mine, alas! Oh that some Angel might a trumpet sound; At which the Church falling upon her face Should crie so loud, untill the trump were drown'd, And by that crie of her deare Lord obtain, That your sweet sap might come again! The Collar. I struck the board, and cry'd, No more, I will abroad. What? shall I ever sigh and pine? My lines and life are free; free as the rode, Loose as the winde, as large as store. Shall I be still in suit? Have I no harvest but a thorn To let me bloud, and not restore What I have lost with cordiall fruit? Sure there was wine Before my sighs did drie it: there was corn Before my tears did drown it. Is the yeare onely lost to me? Have I no bayes to crown it? No flowers, no garlands gay? all blasted? All wasted? Not so, my heart: but there is fruit, And thou hast hands. Recover all thy sigh-blown age On double pleasures: leave thy cold dispute Of what is fit, and not forsake thy cage, Thy rope of sands, Which pettie thoughts have made, and made to thee Good cable, to enforce and draw, And be thy law, While thou didst wink and wouldst not see. Away; take heed: I will abroad. Call in thy deaths head there: tie up thy fears. He that forbears To suit and serve his need, Deserves his load. But as I rav'd and grew more fierce and wilde At every word, Me thoughts I heard one calling, Childe: And I reply'd, My Lord. The Glimpse. Whither away delight? Thou cam'st but now; wilt thou so soon depart, And give me up to night? For many weeks of lingring pain and smart But one half houre of comfort for my heart? Me thinks delight should have More skill in musick, and keep better time. Wert thou a winde or wave, They quickly go and come with lesser crime: Flowers look about, and die not in their prime. Thy short abode and stay Feeds not, but addes to the desire of meat. Lime begg'd of old (they say) A neighbour spring to cool his inward heat; Which by the srpings accesse grew much more great. In hope of thee my heart Pickt here and there a crumme, and would not die; But constant to his part When as my fears foretold this, did replie, A slender thread a gentle guest will tie. Yet if the heart that wept Must let thee go, return when it doth knock. Although thy heap be kept For future times, the droppings of the stock May oft break forth, and never break the lock. If I have more to spinne, The wheel shall go, so that thy stay be short, Thou knowst how grief and sinne Disturb the work. O make me not their sport, Who by thy coming may be made a court! Assurance. O spitefull bitter thought! Bitterly spitefull thought! Couldst thou invent So high a torture? Is such poyson bought? Doubtlesse, but in the way of punishment, When wit contrives to meet with thee, No such rank poyson can there be. Thou said'st but even now, That all was not so fair, as I conceiv'd, Betwixt my God and me; that I allow And coin large hopes; but, that I was deceiv'd: Either the league was broke, or neare it; And, that I had great cause to fear it. And what to this? what more Could poyson, if it had a tongue, expresse? What is thy aim? wouldst thou unlock the doore To cold despairs, and gnawing pensivenesse? Wouldst thou raise devils? I see, I know, I writ thy purpose long ago. But I will to my Father, Who heard thee say it. O most gracious Lord, If all the hope and comfort that I gather, Were from my self, I had not half a word, Not half a letter to oppose What is objected by my foes. But thou art my desert: And in this league, which now my foes invade, Thou art not onely to perform thy part, But also mine; as when the league was made Thou didst at once thy self indite, And hold my hand, while I did write. Wherefore if thou canst fail, Then can thy truth and I: but while rocks stand, And rivers stirre, thou canst not shrink or quail: Yea, when both rocks and all things shall disband, Then shalt thou be my rock and tower, And make their ruine praise thy power. Now foolish thought go on, Spin out thy thread, and make thereof a coat To hide thy shame: for thou hast cast a bone Which bounds on thee, and will not down thy throat: What for itself love once began, Now love and truth will end in man. The Call. Come, my Way, my Truth, my Life: Such a Way, as gives us breath: Such a Truth, as ends all strife: And such a Life, as killeth death. Come, my Light, my Feast, my Strength: Such a Light, as shows a feast: Such a Feast, as mends in length: Such a Strength, as makes his guest. Come, my Joy, my Love, my Heart: Such a Joy, as none can move: Such a Love, as none can part: Such a Heart, as joyes in love. Clasping of hands. Lord, thou art mine, and I am thine, If mine I am: and thine much more, Then I or ought, or can be mine. Yet to be thine, doth me restore; So that again I now am mine, And with advantage mine the more. Since this being mine, brings with it thine, And thou with me dost thee restore. If I without thee would be mine, I neither should be mine nor thine. Lord, I am thine, and thou art mine: So mine thou art, that something more I may presume thee mine, then thine. For thou didst suffer to restore Not thee, but me, and to be mine: And with advantage mine the more, Since thou in death wast none of thine, Yet then as mine didst me restore. O be mine still! still make me thine! Or rather make no Thine and Mine! Praise. Lord, I will mean and speak thy praise, Thy praise alone. My busie heart shall spin it all my dayes: And when it stops for want of store, Then will I wring it with a sigh or grone, That thou mayst yet have more. When thou dost favour any action, It runnes, it flies: All things concurre to give it a perfection. That which had but two legs before, When thou dost blesse, hath twelve: one wheel doth rise To twentie then, or more. But when thou dost on businesse blow, It hangs, it clogs: Not all the teams of Albion in a row Can hale or draw it out of doore. Legs are but stumps, and Pharaohs wheels but logs, And struggling hinders more. Thousands of things do thee employ In ruling all This spacious globe: Angels must have their joy, Devils their rod, the sea his shore, The windes their stint: and yet when I did call, Thou heardst my call, and more. I have not lost one single tear: But when mine eyes. Did weep to heav'n, they found a bottle there. (As we have boxes for the poore) Readie to take them in; yet of a size That would contain much more. But after thou hadst slipt a drop From thy right eye, (Which there did hang like streamers neare the top Of some fair church to show the sore And bloudie battell which thou once didst trie) The glasse was full and more. Wherefore I sing. Yet since my heart, Though press'd, runnes thin; O that I might some other hearts convert, And so take up at use good store: That to thy chests there might be coming in Both all my praise, and more! Josephs coat. Wounded I sing, tormented I indite, Thrown down I fall into a bed, and rest: Sorrow hath chang'd its note: such is his will, Who changeth all things, as him pleaseth best. For well he knows, if but one grief and smart. Among my many had his full career, Sure it would carrie with it ev'n my heart, And both would runne untill they found a biere To fetch the bodie; both being due to grief. But he hath spoil'd the race; and giv'n to anguish One of Joyes coats, ticing it with relief To linger in me, and together languish. I live to shew his power, who once did bring My joyes to weep, and now my griefs to sing. The Pulley. VVhen God at first made man, Having a glasse of blessings standing by; Let us (said he) poure on him all we can: Let the worlds riches, which dispersed lie, Contract into a span. So strength first made a way; Then beautie flow'd, then wisdome, honour, pleasure: When almost all was out, God made a stay, Perceiving that alone of all his treasure Rest in the bottome lay. For if I should (said he) Bestow this jewell also on my creature, He would adore my gifts in stead of me, And rest in Nature, not the God of Nature. So both should losers be. Yet let him keep the rest, But keep them with repining restlesnesse: Let him be rich and wearie, that at least, If goodnesse leade him not, yet wearinesse May tosse him to my breast. The Priesthood. Blest Order, which in power dost so excell, That with th'one hand thou liftest to the sky, And with the other throwest down to hell In thy just censures; fain would I draw nigh, Fain put thee on, exchanging my lay-sword For that of th'holy word. But thou art fire, sacred and hallow'd fire; And I but earth and clay: should I presume To wear thy habit, the severe attire My slender compositions might consume. I am both foul and brittle; much unfit To deal in holy Writ. Yet have I often seen, by cunning hand And force of fire, what curious things are made Of wretched earth. Where once I scorn'd to stand, That earth is fitted by the fire and trade Of skilfull artists, for the boards of those Who make the bravest shows. But since those great ones, be they ne're so great, Come from the earth, from whence those vessels come; So that at once both feeder, dish, and meat Have one beginning and one finall summe: I do not greatly wonder at the sight, If earth in earth delight. But th'holy men of God such vessels are, As serve him up, who all the world commands: When God vouchsafeth to become our fare, Their hands conuey him, who conveys their hands. O what pure things, most pure must those things be, Who bring my God to me! Wherefore I dare not, I, put forth my hand To hold the Ark, although it seem to shake Through th'old sinnes and new doctrines of our land Onely, since God doth often vessels make Of lowly matter for high uses meet, I throw me at his feet. There will I lie, untill my Maker seek For some mean stuffe whereon to show his skill: Then is my time. The distance of the meek Doth flatter power. Left good come short of ill In praising might, the poore do by submission What pride by opposition. The Search. Whither, O, whither art thou fled, My Lord, my Love? My searches are my daily bread; Yet never prove. My knees pierce th'earth, mine eies the skie; And yet the sphere And centre both to me denie That thou art there. Yet can I mark how herbs below Grow green and gay, As if to meet thee they did know, While I decay. Yet can I mark how starres above Simper and shine, As having keyes unto thy love, While poore I pine. I sent a sigh to seek thee out, Deep drawn in pain, Wing'd like an arrow: but my scout Returns in vain. I tun'd another (having store) Into a grone; Because the search was dumbe before: But all was one. Lord, dost thou some new fabrick mold Which favour winnes, And keeps thee present, leaving th'old Unto their sinnes? Where is my God? what hidden place Conceals thee still? What covert dare eclipse thy face? Is it thy will? O let not that of any thing; Let rather brasse, Or steel, or mountains be thy ring, And I will passe. Thy will such an intrenching is, As passeth thought: To it all strength, all subtilties Are things of nought. Thy will such a strange distance is, As that to it East and West touch, the poles do kisse, And parallels meet. Since then my grief must be as large, As is thy space, Thy distance from me; see my charge, Lord, see my case. O take these barres, these lengths away; Turn, and restore me: Be not Almightie, let me say, Against, but for me. When thou dost turn, and wilt be neare; What edge so keen, What point so piercing can appeare To come between? For as thy absence doth excell All distance known: So doth thy nearenesse bear the bell, Making two one. Grief. O who will give me tears? Come all ye springs, Dwell in my head &amp; eyes: come clouds, &amp; rain: My grief hath need of all the watry things, That nature hath produc'd. Let ev'ry vein Suck up a river to supply mine eyes, My weary weeping eyes too drie for me, Unlesse they get new conduits, new supplies To bear them out, and with my state agree. What are two shallow foords, two little spouts Of a lesse world? the greater is but small, A narrow cupboard for my griefs and doubts, Which want provision in the midst of all. Verses, ye are too fine a thing, too wise For my rough sorrows: cease, be dumbe and mute, Give up your feet and running to mine eyes, And keep your measures for some lovers lute, Whose grief allows him musick and a ryme: For mine excludes both measure, tune, and time. Alas, my God! The Crosse. What is this strange and uncouth thing? To make me sigh, and seek, and faint, and die, Untill I had some place, where I might sing, And serve thee; and not onely I, But all my wealth, and familie might combine. To set thy honour up, as our designe. And then when after much delay, Much wrastling, many a combate, this deare end, So much desir'd, is giv'n, to take away My power to serve thee; to unbend All my abilities, my designes confound, And lay my threatnings bleeding on the ground. One ague dwelleth in my bones, Another in my soul (the memorie What I would do for thee, if once my grones Could be allow'd for harmonie) I am in all a weak disabled thing, Save in the sight thereof, where strength doth sting. Besides, things sort not to my will, Ev'n when my will doth studie thy renown: Thou turnest th'edge of all things on me still, Taking me up to throw me down: So that, ev'n when my hopes seem to be sped, I am to grief alive, to them as dead. To have my aim, and yet to be Farther from it then when I bent my bow; To make my hopes my torture, and the fee Of all my woes another wo, Is in the midst of delicates to need, And ev'n in Paradise to be a weed. Ah my deare Father, ease my smart! These contrarieties crush me: these crosse actions Doe winde a rope about, and cut my heart: And yet since these thy contradictions Are properly a crosse felt by thy sonne, With but foure words, my words, Thy will be done. The Flower. How fresh, O Lord, how sweet and clean Are thy returns! ev'n as the flowers in spring; To which, besides their own demean, The late-past frosts tributes of pleasure bring. Grief melts away Like snow in May, As if there were no such cold thing. Who would have thought my shrivel'd heart Could have recover'd greennesse? It was gone Quite underground; as flowers depart To see their mother-root, when they have blown; Where they together All the hard weather, Dead to the world, keep house unknown. These are thy wonders, Lord of power, Killing and quickning, bringing down to hell And up to heaven in an houre; Making a chiming of a passing-bell, We say amisse, This or that is: Thy word is all, if we could spell. O that I once past changing were, Fast in thy Paradise, where no flower can wither! Many a spring I shoot up fair, Offring at heav'n, growing and groning thither: Nor doth my flower Want a spring-showre, My sinnes and I joining together: But while I grow in a straight line, Still upwards bent, as if heav'n were mine own, Thy anger comes, and I decline: What frost to that? what pole is not the zone, Where all things burn, When thou dost turn, And the least frown of thine is shown? And now in age I bud again, After so many deaths I live and write; I once more smell the dew and rain, And relish versing: O my onely light, It cannot be That I am he On whom thy tempests fell all night. These are thy wonders, Lord of love, To make us see we are but flowers that glide: Which when we once can finde and prove, Thou hast a garden for us, where to bide. Who would be more, Swelling through store, Forfeit their Paradise by their pride. Dotage. False glozing pleasures, casks of happinesse, Foolish night-fires, womens and childrens wishes, Chases in Arras, guilded emptinesse, Shadows well mounted, dreams in a career, Embroider'd lyes, nothing between two dishes; These are the pleasures here. True earnest sorrows, rooted miseries, Anguish in grain, vexations ripe and blown, Sure-footed griefs, solid calamities, Plain demonstrations, evident and cleare, Fetching their proofs ev'n from the very bone; These are the sorrows here. But oh the folly of distracted men, Who griefs in earnest, joyes in jest pursue; Preferring, like brute beasts, a lothsome den Before a court, ev'n that above so cleare, Where are no sorrows, but delights more true, Then miseries are here! The Sonne. Let forrain nations of their language boast, What fine varietie each tongue affords: I like our language, as our men and coast: Who cannot dresse it well, want wit, not words. How neatly doe we give one onely name To parents issue and the sunnes bright starre! A sonne is light and fruit; a fruitfull flame Chasing the fathers dimnesse, carri'd farre From the first man in th'East, to fresh and new Western discov'ries of posteritie. So in one word our Lords humilitie We turn upon him in a sense most true: For what Christ once in humblenesse began, We him in glorie call, The Sonne of Man. A true Hymne. My joy, my life, my crown! My heart was meaning all the day, Somewhat it fain would say: And still it runneth mutt'ring up and down With onely this, My joy, my life, my crown. Yet slight not these few words: If truly said, they may take part Among the best in art. The finenesse which a hymne or psalme affords, Is, when the soul unto the lines accords. He who craves all the minde, And all the soul, and strength, and time, If the words onely ryme, Justly complains, that somewhat is behinde To make his verse, or write a hymne in kinde. Whereas if th'heart be moved, Although the verse be somewhat scant, God doth supplie the want. As when th'heart sayes (sighing to be approved) O, could I love! and stops: God writeth, Loved. The Answer. My comforts drop and melt away like snow: I shake my head, and all the thoughts and ends, Which my fierce youth did bandie, fall and flow Like leaves about me; or like summer friends, Flyes of estates and sunne-shine. But to all, Who think me eager, hot, and undertaking, But in my prosecutions slack and small; As a young exhalation, newly waking, Scorns his first bed of dirt, and means the sky; But cooling by the way, grows pursie and slow, And setling to a cloud, doth live and die In that dark state of tears: to all, that so Show me, and set me, I have one reply, Which they that know the rest, know more then I. A Dialogue-Antheme. Christian. Death. Chr. Alas, poore Death, where is thy glorie? Where is thy famous force, thy ancient sting? Dea. Alas poore mortall, void of storie, Go spell and reade how I have kill'd thy King. Chr. Poore death and who was hurt thereby? Thy curse being laid on him, makes thee accurst. Dea. Let losers talk: yet thou shalt die; These arms shall crush thee. Chr. Spare not, do thy worst, I shall be one day better then before: Thou so much worse, that thou shalt be no more. The Water-course. Thou who dost dwell and linger here below, Since the condition of this world is frail, Where of all plants afflictions soonest grow; If troubles overtake thee, do not wail: For who can look for lesse, that loveth Life./Strife. But rather turn the pipe, and waters course To serve thy sinnes, and furnish thee with store Of sov'raigne tears, springing from true remorse: That so in purenesse thou mayst him adore, Who gives to man, as he sees fit Salvation./Damnation. Self-condemnation. Thou who condemnest Jewish hate, For choosing Barabbas a murderer Before the Lord of glorie; Look back upon thine own estate, Call home thine eye (that busie wanderer) That choice may be thy storie. He that doth love, and love amisse This worlds delights before true Christian joy, Hath made a Jewish choice: The world an ancient murderer is; Thousands of souls it hath and doth destroy With her enchanting voice. He that hath made a sorrie wedding Between his soul and gold, and hath preferr'd False gain before the true, Hath done what he condemnes in reading: For he hath sold for money his deare Lord, And is a Judas-Jew. Thus we prevent the last great day, And judge our selves. That light, which sin &amp; passion Did before dimme and choke, When once those snuffes are ta'ne away, Shines bright and cleare, ev'n unto condemnation, Without excuse or cloke. Bitter-sweet. Ah my deare angrie Lord, Since thou dost love, yet strike; Cast down, yet help afford; Sure I will do the like. I will complain, yet praise; I will bewail, approve: And all my sowre-sweet dayes I will lament, and love. The Glance. When first thy sweet and gracious eye Vouchsaf'd ev'n in the midst of youth and night To look upon me, who before did lie Weltring in sinne; I felt a sugred strange delight, Passing all cordials made by any art, Bedew, embalme, and overrunne my heart, And take it in. Since that time many a bitter storm My soul hath felt, ev'n able to destroy, Had the malicious and ill-meaning harm His swing and sway: But still thy sweet originall joy Sprung from thine eye, did work within my soul, And surging griefs, when they grew bold, controll, And got the day. If thy first glance so powerfull be, A mirth but open'd and seal'd up again; What wonders shall we feel, when we shall see Thy full-ey'd love! When thou shalt look us out of pain, And one aspect of thine spend in delight More then a thousand sunnes disburse in light, In heav'n above. The 23 Psalme. The God of love my shepherd is, And he that doth me feed: While he is mine, and I am his, What can I want or need? He leads me to the tender grasse, Where I both feed and rest; Then to the streams that gently passe; In both I have the best. Or if I stray, he doth convert And bring my minde in frame: And all this not for my desert, But for his holy name. Yea, in deaths shadie black abode Well may I walk, not fear: For thou art with me; and thy rod To guide, thy staffe to bear. Nay, thou dost make me sit and dine, Ev'n in my enemies sight: My head with oyl, my cup with wine Runnes over day and night. Surely thy sweet and wondrous love Shall measure all my dayes; And as it never shall remove, So neither shall my praise. Marie Magdalene. When blessed Marie wip'd her Saviours feet, (Whose precepts she had trampled on before) And wore them for a jewell on her head, Shewing his steps should be the street, Wherein she thenceforth evermore With pensive humblenesse would live and tread: She being stain'd her self, why did she strive To make him clean, who could not be defil'd? Why kept she not her tears for her own faults, And not his feet? Though we could dive In tears like seas, our sinnes are pil'd Deeper then they, in words, and works, and thoughts. Deare soul, she knew who did vouchsafe and deigne To bear her filth; and that her sinnes did dash Ev'n God himself: wherefore she was not loth, As she had brought wherewith to stain, So to bring in wherewith to wash: And yet in washing one, she washed both. Aaron. Holinesse on the head, Light and perfections on the breast, Harmonious bells below, raising the dead To leade them unto life and rest. Thus are true Aarons drest. Profanenesse in my head, Defects and darknesse in my breast, A noise of passions ringing me for dead Unto a place where is no rest. Poore priest thus am I drest. Onely another head I have, another heart and breast, Another musick, making live not dead, Without whom I could have no rest: In him I am well drest. Christ is my onely head, My alone onely heart and breast, My onely musick, striking me ev'n dead; That to the old man I may rest, And be in him new drest. So holy in my head, Perfect and light in my deare breast, My doctrine tun'd by Christ, (who is not dead, But lives in me while I do rest) Come people; Aaron's drest. The Odour, 2. Cor. 2. How sweetly doth My Master sound! My Master! As Amber-greese leaves a rich sent Unto the taster: So do these words a sweet content, An orientall fragrancie, My Master. With these all day I do perfume my minde, My minde ev'n thrust into them both; That I might finde What cordials make this curious broth, This broth of smells, that feeds and fats my minde. My Master, shall I speak? O that to thee My servant were a little so, As flesh may be; That these two words might creep &amp; grow To some degree of spicinesse to thee! Then should the Pomander, which was before A speaking sweet, mend by reflection, And tell me more: For pardon of my imperfection Would warm and work it sweeter then before. For when My Master, which alone is sweet, And ev'n in my unworthinesse pleasing, Shall call and meet, My servant, as thee not displeasing, That call is but the breathing of the sweet. This breathing would with gains by sweetning me (As sweet things traffick when they meet) Return to thee. And so this new commerce and sweet Should all my life employ, and busie me. The Foil. If we could see below The sphere of vertue, and each shining grace As plainly as that above doth show; This were the better skie, the brighter place. God hath made starres the foil To set off vertues; griefs to set off sinning: Yet in this wretched world we toil, As if grief were not foul, nor vertue winning. The Forerunners. The harbingers are come. See, see their mark; White is their colour, and behold my head. But must they have my brain? must they dispark Those sparkling notions, which therein were bred? Must dulnesse turn me to a clod? Yet have they left me, Thou art still my God. Good men ye be, to leave me my best room, Ev'n all my heart, and what is lodged there: I passe not, I, what of the rest become, So Thou art still my God, be out of fear. He will be pleased with that dittie; And if I please him, I write fine and wittie. Farewell sweet phrases, lovely metaphors. But will ye leave me thus? when ye before Of stews and brothels onely knew the doores, Then did I wash you with my tears, and more, Brought you to Church well drest and clad; My God must have my best, ev'n all I had. Louely enchanting language, sugar-cane, Hony of roses, whither wilt thou flie? Hath some fond lover tic'd thee to thy bane? And wilt thou leave the Church, and love a stie? Fie, thou wilt soil thy broider'd coat, And hurt thy self, and him that sings the note. Let foolish lovers, if they will love dung, With canvas, not with arras clothe their shame: Let follie speak in her own native tongue. True beautie dwells on high: ours is a flame But borrow'd thence to light us thither. Beautie and beauteous words should go together. Yet if you go, I passe not; take your way: For, Thou art still my God, is all that ye Perhaps with more embellishment can say, Go birds of spring: let winter have his fee, Let a bleak palenesse chalk the doore, So all within be livelier then before. The Rose. Presse me not to take more pleasure In this world of sugred lies, And to use a larger measure Then my strict, yet welcome size. First, there is no pleasure here: Colour'd griefs indeed there are, Blushing woes, that look as cleare As if they could beautie spare. Or if such deceits there be, Such delights I meant to say; There are no such things to me, Who have pass'd my right away. But I will not much oppose Unto what you now advise; Onely take this gentle rose, And therein my answer lies. What is fairer then a rose? What is sweeter? yet it purgeth. Purgings enmitie disclose, Enmitie forbearance urgeth. If then all that worldlings prize Be contracted to a rose; Sweetly there indeed it lies, But it biteth in the close. So this flower doth judge and sentence Worldly joyes to be a scourge: For they all produce repentance, And repentance is a purge. But I health, not physick choose: Onely though I you oppose, Say that fairly I refuse, For my answer is a rose. Discipline. Throw away thy rod, Throw away thy wrath: O my God, Take the gentle path. For my hearts desire Unto thine is bent: I aspire To a full consent. Not a word or look I affect to own, But by book, And thy book alone. Though I fail, I weep: Though I halt in pace, Yet I creep To the throne of grace. Then let wrath remove; Love will do the deed: For with love Stonie hearts will bleed. Love is swift of foot; Love's a man of warre, And can shoot, And can hit from farre. Who can scape his bow? That which wrought on thee, Brought thee low, Needs must work on me. Throw away thy rod; Though man frailties hath, Thou art God: Throw away thy wrath. The Invitation. Come ye hither all, whose taste Is your waste; Save your cost, and mend your fare. God is here prepar'd and drest, And the feast, God, in whom all dainties are. Come ye hither all, whom wine Doth define, Naming you not to your good: Weep what ye have drunk amisse, And drink this, Which before ye drink is bloud. Come ye hither all, whom pain Doth arraigne, Bringing all your sinnes to sight: Taste and fear not: God is here In this cheer, And on sinne doth cast the fright. Come ye hither all, whom joy Doth destroy, While ye graze without your bounds: Here is joy that drowneth quite Your delight, As a floud the lower grounds. Come ye hither all, whose love Is your dove, And exalts you to the skie: Here is love, which having breath Ev'n in death, After death can never die. Lord I have invited all, And I shall Still invite, still call to thee: For it seems but just and right In my sight, Where is all, there all should be. The Banquet. Welcome sweet and sacred cheer, Welcome deare; With me, in me, live and dwell: For thy neatnesse passeth sight, Thy delight Passeth tongue to taste or tell. O what sweetnesse from the bowl Fills my soul, Such as is, and makes divine! Is some starre (fled from the sphere) Melted there, As we sugar melt in wine? Or hath sweetnesse in the bread Made a head To subdue the smell of sinne; Flowers, and gummes, and powders giving All their living, Lest the enemie should winne? Doubtlesse, neither starre nor flower Hath the power Such a sweetnesse to impart: Onely God, who gives perfumes, Flesh assumes, And with it perfumes my heart. But as Pomanders and wood Still are good, Yet being bruis'd are better sented: God, to show how farre his love Could improve, Here, as broken, is presented. When I had forgot my birth, And on earth In delights of earth was drown'd; God took bloud, and needs would be Spilt with me, And so found me on the ground. Having rais'd me to look up, In a cup Sweetly he doth meet my taste. But I still being low and short, Farre from court, Wine becomes a wing at last. For with it alone I flie To the skie: Where I wipe mine eyes, and see What I seek, for what I sue; Him I view, Who hath done so much for me. Let the wonder of this pitie Be my dittie, And take up my lines and life: Hearken under pain of death, Hands and breath; Strive in this, and love the strife. The Posie. Let wits contest, And with their words and posies windows fill: Lesse then the least Of all thy mercies, is my posie still. This on my ring, This by my picture, in my book I write; Whether I sing, Or say, or dictate, this is my delight. Invention rest, Comparisons go play, wit use thy will: Lesse then the least Of all Gods mercies, is my posie still. A Parodie. Souls joy, when thou art gone, And I alone, Which cannot be, Because thou dost abide with me, And I depend on thee; Yet when thou dost suppresse The cheerfulnesse Of thy abode, And in my powers not stirre abroad, But leave me to my load: O what a damp and shade Doth me invade! No stormie night Can so afflict or so affright, As thy eclipsed light. Ah Lord! do not withdraw, Lest want of aw Make Sinne appeare; And when thou dost but shine lesse cleare, Say, that thou art not here. And then what life I have, While Sinne doth rave, And falsly boast, That I may seek, but thou art lost; Thou and alone thou know'st. O what a deadly cold Doth me infold! I half beleeve, That Sinne sayes true: but while I grieve, Thou com'st and dost relieve. The Elixer. Teach me, my God and King, In all things thee to see, And what I do in any thing, To do it as for thee: Not rudely, as a beast, To runne into an action; But still to make thee prepossest, And give it his perfection. A man that looks on glasse, On it may stay his eye; Or if he pleaseth, through it passe, And then the heav'n espie. All may of thee partake: Nothing can be so mean, Which with his tincture (for thy sake) Will not grow bright and clean. A servant with this clause Makes drudgerie divine: Who sweeps a room, as for thy laws, Makes that and th'action fine. This is the famous stone That turneth all to gold: For that which God doth touch and own Cannot for lesse be told. A Wreath. A wreathed garland of deserved praise, Of praise deserved, unto thee I give, I give to thee, who knowest all my wayes, My crooked winding wayes, wherein I live, Wherein I die, not live: for life is straight, Straight as a line, and ever tends to thee, To thee, who art more farre above deceit, Then deceit seems above simplicitie. Give me simplicitie, that I may live, So live and like, that I may know thy wayes, Know them and practise them: then shall I give For this poore wreath, give thee a crown of praise. Death. Death, thou wast once an uncouth hideous thing, Nothing but bones, The sad effect of sadder grones: Thy mouth was open, but thou couldst not sing. For we consider'd thee as at some six Or ten yeares hence, After the losse of life and sense, Flesh being turn'd to dust, and bones to sticks. We lookt on this side of thee, shooting short; Where we did finde The shells of fledge souls left behinde, Dry dust, which sheds no tears, but may extort. But since our Saviours death did put some bloud Into thy face; Thou art grown fair and full of grace, Much in request, much sought for, as a good. For we do now behold thee gay and glad, As at dooms-day; When souls shall wear their new aray, And all thy bones with beautie shall be clad. Therefore we can go die as sleep, and trust Half that we have Unto an honest faithfull grave; Making our pillows either down, or dust. Dooms-day. Come away, Make no delay. Summon all the dust to rise, Till it stirre, and rubbe the eyes; While this member jogs the other, Each one whispring, Live you brother? Come away, Make this the day. Dust, alas, no musick feels, But thy trumpet: then it kneels, As peculiar notes and strains Cure Tarantulaes raging pains. Come away, O make no stay! Let the graves make their confession, Lest at length they plead possession: Fleshes stubbornnesse may have Read that lesson to the grave. Come away, Thy flock doth stray. Some to windes their bodie lend, And in them may drown a friend: Some in noisome vapours grow To a plague and publick wo. Come away, Help our decay. Man is out of order hurl'd, Parcel'd out to all the world. Lord, thy broken consort raise, And the musick shall be praise. Judgement. Almightie Judge, how shall poore wretches brook Thy dreadfull look, Able a heart of iron to appall, When thou shalt call For ev'ry mans peculiar book? What others mean to do, I know not well; Yet I heare tell, That some will turn thee to some leaves therein So void of sinne, That they in merit shall excell. But I resolve, when thou shalt call for mine, That to decline, And thrust a Testament into thy hand: Let that be scann'd. There thou shalt finde my faults are thine. Heaven. O who will show me those delights on high? Echo. I. Thou Echo, thou art mortall, all men know. Echo. No. Wert thou not born among the trees and leaves? Echo. Leaves. And are there any leaves, that still abide? Echo. Bide. What leaves are they? impart the matter wholly. Echo. Holy. Are holy leaves the Echo then of blisse? Echo. Yes. Then tell me, what is that supreme delight? Echo. Light. Light to the minde: what shall the will enjoy? Echo. Joy. But are there cares and businesse with the pleasure? Echo. Leisure. Light, joy, and leisure; but shall they persever? Echo. Ever. Love. Love bade me welcome: yet my soul drew back, Guiltie of dust and sinne. But quick-ey'd Love, observing me grow slack From my first entrance in, Drew nearer to me, sweetly questioning, If I lack'd any thing. A guest, I answer'd, worthy to be here: Love said, you shall be he. I the unkinde, ungratefull? Ah my deare, I cannot look on thee. Love took my hand, and smiling did reply, Who made the eyes but I? Truth Lord, but I have marr'd them: let my shame Go where it doth deserve. And know you not, sayes Love, who bore the blame? My deare, then I will serve. You must sit down, sayes Love, and taste my meat: So I did sit and eat. FINIS. Glorie be to God on high, and on earth peace, good will towards men. The Church Militant. Almightie Lord, who from thy glorious throne Seest and rulest all things ev'n as one: The smallest ant or atome knows thy power, Known also to each minute of an houre: Much more do Common-weals acknowledge thee, And wrap their policies in thy decree, Complying with thy counsels, doing nought Which doth not meet with an eternall thought. But above all, thy Church and Spouse doth prove Not the decrees of power, but bands of love. Early didst thou arise to plant this vine, Which might the more indeare it to be thine. Spices come from the East; so did thy Spouse, Trimme as the light, sweet as the laden boughs Of Noahs shadie vine, chaste as the dove; Prepar'd and fitted to receive thy love. The course was westward, that the sunne might light As well our understanding as our sight. Where th'Ark did rest, there Abraham began To bring the other Ark from Canaan. Moses pursu'd this: but King Solomon Finish'd and fixt the old religion. When it grew loose, the Jews did hope in vain By nailing Christ to fasten it again. But to the Gentiles he bore crosse and all, Rending with earthquakes the partition-wall: Onely whereas the Ark in glorie shone, Now with the crosse, as with a staffe, alone, Religion, like a pilgrime, westward bent, Knocking at all doores, ever as she went. Yet as the sunne, though forward be his flight, Listens behinde him, and allows some light, Till all depart: so went the Church her way, Letting, while one foot stept, the other stay Among the eastern nations for a time, Till both removed to the western clime. To Egypt first she came, where they did prove Wonders of anger once, but now of love. The ten Commandments there did flourish more Then the ten bitter plagues had done before. Holy Macarius and great Anthonie Made Pharaoh Moses, changing th'historie. Goshen was darknesse, Egypt full of lights, Nilus for monsters brought forth Israelites. Such power hath mightie Baptisme to produce For things misshapen, things of highest use. How deare to me, O God, thy counsels are! Who may with thee compare? Religion thence fled into Greece, where arts Gave her the highest place in all mens hearts. Learning was pos'd, Philosophie was set, Sophisters taken in a fishers net. Plato and Aristotle were at a losse, And wheel'd about again to spell Christ-Crosse. Prayers chas'd syllogismes into their den, And Ergo was transform'd into Amen. Though Greece took horse as soon as Egypt did, And Rome as both; yet Egypt faster rid, And spent her period and prefixed time Before the other. Greece being past her prime, Religion went to Rome, subduing those, Who, that they might subdue, made all their foes. The Warrier his deere skarres no more resounds, But seems to yeeld Christ hath the greater wounds, Wounds willingly endur'd to work his blisse, Who by an ambush lost his Paradise. The great heart stoops, and taketh from the dust A sad repentance, not the spoils of lust: Quitting his spear, lest it should pierce again Him in his members, who for him was slain. The Shepherds hook grew to a scepter here, Giving new names and numbers to the yeare. But th'Empire dwelt in Greece, to comfort them Who were cut short in Alexanders stemme. In both of these Prowesse and Arts did tame And tune mens hearts against the Gospel came. Which using, and not fearing skill in th'one, Or strength in th'other, did erect her throne. Many a rent and struggling th'Empire knew, (As dying things are wont) untill it flew At length to Germanie, still westward bending, And there the Churches festivall attending: That as before Empire and Arts made way, (For no lesse Harbingers would serve then they) So they might still, and point us out the place Where first the Church should raise her down-cast face, Strength levels grounds, Art makes a garden there; Then showres Religion, and makes all to bear. Spain in the Empire shar'd with Germanie, But England in the higher victorie: Giving the Church a crown to keep her state, And not go lesse then she had done of late. Constantines British line meant this of old, And did this mysterie wrap up and fold Within a sheet of paper, which was rent From times great Chronicle, and hither sent. Thus both the Church and Sunne together ran Unto the farthest old meridian. How deare to me, O God, thy counsels are! Who may with thee compare? Much about one and the same time and place, Both where and when the Church began her race, Sinne did set out of Eastern Babylon, And travell'd westward also: journeying on He chid the Church away, where e're he came, Breaking her peace, and tainting her good name. At first he got to Egypt, and did sow Gardens of gods, which ev'ry yeare did grow, Fresh and fine deities. They were at great cost, Who for a god clearely a sallet lost. Ah, what a thing is man devoid of grace, Adoring garlick with an humble face, Begging his food of that which he may eat, Starving the while he worshippeth his meat! Who makes a root his god, how low is he, If God and man be sever'd infinitely! What wretchednesse can give him any room, Whose house is foul, while he adores his broom? None will beleeve this now, though money be In us the same transplanted foolerie. Thus Sinne in Egypt sneaked for a while; His highest was an ox or crocodile, And such poore game. Thence he to Greece doth passe, And being craftier much then Goodnesse was, He left behinde him garrisons of sinnes To make good that which ev'ry day he winnes. Here Sinne took heart, and for a garden-bed Rich shrines and oracles he purchased: He grew a gallant, and would needs foretell As well what should befall, as what befell. Nay, he became a poet, and would serve His pills of sublimate in that conserve. The world came both with hands and purses full To this great lotterie, and all would pull. But all was glorious cheating, brave deceit, Where some poore truths were shuffled for a bait To credit him, and to discredit those Who after him should braver truths disclose. From Greece he went to Rome: and as before He was a God, now he's an Emperour. Nero and others lodg'd him bravely there, Put him in trust to rule the Romane sphere. Glorie was his chief instrument of old: Pleasure succeeded straight, when that grew cold. Which soon was blown to such a mightie flame, That though our Saviour did destroy the game, Disparking oracles, and all their treasure, Setting affliction to encounter pleasure; Yet did a rogue with hope of carnall joy Cheat the most subtill nations. Who so coy, So trimme, as Greece and Egypt? yet their hearts Are given over, for their curious arts, To such Mahometan stupidities, As the old heathen would deem prodigies, How deare to me, O God, thy counsels are! Who may with thee compare? Onely the West and Rome do keep them free From this contagious infidelitie. And this is all the Rock, whereof they boast, As Rome will one day finde unto her cost. Sinne being not able to extirpate quite The Churches here, bravely resolv'd one night To be a Church-man too, and wear a Mitre: The old debauched ruffian would turn writer. I saw him in his studie, where he sate Busie in controversies sprung of late. A gown and pen became him wondrous well: His grave aspect had more of heav'n then hell: Onely there was a handsome picture by, To which he lent a corner of his eye. As Sinne in Greece a Prophet was before, And in old Rome a mightie Emperour; So now being Priest he plainly did professe To make a jest of Christs three offices: The father since his scatter'd jugglings were United now in one both time and sphere. From Egypt he took pettie deities, From Greece oracular infallibilities, And from old Rome the libertie of pleasure, By free dispensings of the Churches treasure. Then in memoriall of his ancient throne He did surname his palace, Babylon. Yet that he might the better gain all nations, And make that name good by their transmigrations, From all these places, but at divers times, He took fine vizards to conceal his crimes: From Egypt Anchorisme and retirednesse, Learning from Greece, from old Rome statelinesse: And blending these he carri'd all mens eyes, While Truth sat by, counting his victories: Whereby he grew apace and scorn'd to use Such force as once did captivate the Jews; But did bewitch, and finely work each nation Into a voluntarie transmigration. All poste to Rome: Princes submit their necks Either t'his publick foot or private tricks. It did not fit his gravitie to stirre, Nor his long journey, nor his gout and furre. Therefore he sent out able ministers, Statesmen within, without doores cloisterers: Who without spear, or sword, or other drumme Then what was in their tongue, did overcome; And having conquer'd, did so strangely rule, That the whole world did seem but the Popes mule. As new and old Rome did one Empire twist; So both together are one Antichrist, Yet with two faces, as their Janus was; Being in this their old crackt looking-glasse. How deare to me, O God, thy counsels are! Who may with thee compare? Thus Sinne triumphs in Western Babylon; Yet not as Sinne, but as Religion. Of his two thrones he made the latter best, And to defray his journey from the east. Old and new Babylon are to hell and night, As is the moon and sunne to heav'n and light. When th'one did set, the other did take place, Confronting equally the law and grace. They are hells land-marks, Satans double crest: They are Sinnes nipples, feeding th'east and west. But as in vice the copie still exceeds The pattern, but not so in vertuous deeds; So though Sinne made his latter seat the better, The latter Church is to the first a debter. The second Temple could not reach the first: And the late reformation never durst Compare with ancient times and purer yeares; But in the Jews and us deserveth tears. Nay, it shall ev'ry yeare decrease and fade, Till such a darknesse do the world invade At Christs last coming, as his first did finde: Yet must there such proportions be assign'd To these diminishings, as is between The spacious world and Jurie to be seen. Religion stands on tip-toe in our land, Readie to passe to the American strand. When height of malice, and prodigious lusts, Impudent sinning, witchcrafts, and distrusts (The marks of future bane) shall fill our cup Unto the brimme, and make our measure up; When Sein shall swallow Tiber, and the Thames By letting in them both, pollutes her streams: When Italie of us shall have her will, And all her calender of sinnes fulfill; Whereby one may fortell, what sinnes next yeare Shall both in France and England domineer: Then shall Religion to America flee: They have their times of Gospel, ev'n as we. My God, thou dost prepare for them a way By carrying first their gold from them away: For gold and grace did never yet agree: Religion alwaies sides with povertie. We think we rob them, but we think amisse: We are more poore, and they more rich by this. Thou wilt revenge their quarrell, making grace To pay our debts, and leave our ancient place To go to them, while that which now their nation But lends to us, shall be our desolation. Yet as the Church shall thither westward flie, So Sinne shall trace and dog her instantly: They have their period also and set times Both for their vertuous actions and their crimes. And where of old the Empire and the Arts Usher'd the Gospel ever in mens hearts, Spain hath done one; when Arts perform the other, The Church shall come, &amp; Sinne the Church shall smother: That when they haue accomplished the round, And met in th'east their first and ancient sound, Judgement may meet them both &amp; search them round Thus do both lights, as well in Church as Sunne, Light one another, and together runne. Thus also Sinne and Darknesse follow still The Church and Sunne with all their power and skill. But as the Sunne still goes both west and east; So also did the Church by going west Still eastward go; because it drew more neare To time and place, where judgement shall appeare. How deare to me, O God, thy counsels are! Who may with thee compare? L' Envoy. King of glorie, King of peace, With the one make warre to cease; With the other blesse thy sheep, Thee to love, in thee to sleep. Let not Sinne devoure thy fold, Bragging that thy bloud is cold, That thy death is also dead, While his conquests dayly spread; That thy flesh hath lost his food, And thy Crosse is common wood. Choke him, let him say no more, But reserve his breath in store, Till thy conquests and his fall Make his sighs to use it all, And then bargain with the winde To discharge what is behinde. Blessed be God alone, Thrice blessed Three in One. FINIS.</field>
