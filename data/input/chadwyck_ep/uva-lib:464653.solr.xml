Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. [This way with God's word will not agree.] [Begins Imperfectly.] This way with God's word will not agree. Wherfore, good Father, in time heere repent, And haue a respect vnto Christ's Testament. Father. What, Robin, me thinks thov hast little wit; Doost thov think scorne to come to promotion: For to marry with gentills I trow it is fit, Hauing with them of money a good portion; What thovgh it be gotten by craft and extortion, By the Masse, it is all my delight and pleasvre Beware of extorcion. To haue heere abovndance of worldly treasvre. Robin. By extortion, Father? mary, God it forefend, That any Christian man therin shovld delight: Father, giue me no stolne goods my welth to amend, Vnlesse I doo liue by the poore man's right, As I feare that some doo, both Lorde and Knight. Wherfore, good Father, in time heere repent, And haue a respect vnto Christ's Testament. Father. Ah, Robin, I perceiue now, so God me saue, That thov wilt be bvt a meane gentleman, Seeing yov be svch a Conscionable knaue; A shameless answer for a Parent.Goe seeke thov thy liuing where that thov can; Tvsh, what care I, thovgh the people me ban. By the Masse, it is all my delight and pleasvre To haue heere abovndance of worldly treasvre. Robin. Oh! Father, seeke first heere the kingdome of Heauen, And gather yov vp of God's treasvre therin to lay: And not wicked Mammon to fvlfill the sinnes seuen, For that were a uery right damnable way; Remember, father, that yov be bvt earth and clay. Wherfore, good father, I pray yov yet repent, And haue a respect vnto Christ's Testament. Father. Robin, wovldst thov not haue me to bvy and sell? Nor yet to keepe in store for to doo me good? By the masse, if I follow thee or the gospell, Men may buy and sell and keepe in store, so it be doon lawfully, and in a right caus. At the length I might chance to lye in my hood. Tvsh, I will be covnted heere for a lvsty blood, Seeing it is all my delight and pleasvre: I will haue abovndance of worldly treasvre. Robin. Father, yov haue enovgh, if yov haue not too mvch, Be liberal vnto the poore. For this I dare be bolde heere to auow: Yo haue ten times more grovnd and money in yovr hvtch, Then euer had my Grand-sire, yov will this allow; Yet he kept a better hovse then euer did yov. Wherfore, good father, amend and repent, And haue a respect vnto Christ's Testament. Father. Tvsh, Robin, thy talke is foolish and fond, I know thy minde what thov goest abovt: Thov wovldst haue me to liue only by my land, And to keepe open hovse for euery Jack lovt; No, I will feast none bvt the rvfling rovt. For it is all my delight and pleasvre To haue heere abovndance of worldly treasvre. Robin. Father, I wovld haue yov liue so that God may be pleased, And for yovr good life God will giue yov meede: Father, spend yovr goods so that the poore may be eased, For yovr riches be lent yov to doo svch a deede, And not to spende all on the rich, for they haue no neede. Wherfore, good father, in time yet repent, And haue a respect vnto Christ's Testament. Father. By the masse, Robin, I think thov art mad, Shovld I feast beggers? mary, fie for shame, The bread of the needfull is the life of the poore. Eccles. 34.I dare say it wovld make some gentlemen sad, That all rich men shovld haue svch a name. Yea, I my selfe will confesse the same, Seeing it is my whole delight and pleasvre, To haue heere abovndance of worldely treasvre. Robin. Father. What gvppe, Robin, gvppe boy, gvppe hereticke and fole! Now Goddes dere cvrse I geve the and mine. Mary, syr, ye haue gone to longe to schole A gaynst my riches and welth to repyn; By the masse, yf thov to the Scriptvre incline, The rebuke and admonicion of the generacyon of Satan. Be svre that I wyll neuer do the pleasor Nor yet neuer helpe the, with none of my treasor. Robin. O father, father, yet arise vp and awake Ovt of thys slepe of cvrsed couetovs snare. God wyllynge, I wyll neuer Godes worde forsake, Nether for yov, nor for worldlye welfare, Good father, now leaue here yovr carpe and care: For you haue ynovgh; wherfore be content, Onles yov [wyll] be dampned at the daye of ivdgement. Father. What, dampned, Robin? mary, that were a toye. Tvsshe, a dewe, farwell: for I mvst departe. Ah, Robin, Robin, thov art a shrovd boy, For thy wordes pearceth me euen to the hart: Well, yet I wyll go walke downe vnto my cart, Where a mans hart is, there is his God. For [I do] nothyng, Robin, bvt for my pleasor, Oh, howe my hart is styll vpon worldlye treasor. Robin. Repent, father, repent, for yovr goodes is yovr God: Repent, or els yov be for euer in a dampnable case. Be ware, father, for our Lorde wyll stryke wyth his rod, God knoweth how, or in what time or space. Father, God wyllynge, I will home to yovr place, To covnsell my mother also to repent, For bothe of yov be neye uoyde of all grace, Wherfore applye yov in tyme to be penytent. [And to haue a respect vnto Christ's Testament.] Finis. Here endeth Robin and his Father. Heere beginneth Mother Newgise to talk with Robin her Sonne, onely for the ease and pleasvre of this world. Uery necessary to be read and marked of all newfangled women, that they may auoide the desires therof. Mother. Soone Robert, I heard say that yovr father and yov Haue had, since yov went, great commvnication Concerning ovr welth, which yov will not allow; Yov are of svch a strange holy fashion; Bvt this shalbe only my preparation, To liue and goe gentle-like, gallant and gay, Seeing it is my cheefe desire alway. Robin. Mother, like as I said of late vnto my father, Euen so I say now vnto yov certaine: I wovld wish yov to desire God's kingdome rather, Then either welth, ease, pleasvre or gaine; Mother, beware of apparell, for it is bvt uaine; Wherfore, good Mother, marke this thing well: Yet liue and goe Christian like after the Gospell. Mother. Sonne, I will liue easily now in mine olde age, A wicked desire of new fangled women. And also goe as gallantly as I can deuise: What, thovgh the people doo raile and rage, And say, that I goe painted vp like bvtter-flyes, I will haue my clothes made of the new gise. To liue and goe gentle like, gallant and gay, Oh, Sonne, it is my cheefe desire alway. Robin. Yet, mother, remember the uertvovs good wiues, As Sara, Rebecca and Rachell, with many other moe: Which clothed them-selues all the dayes of their liues With shamefastnes, chastitie and sobrietie also, Which contrary to their hvsband's minde wovld not goe; Wherfor, good mother, marke this thing well, To liue and goe Christian like after the gospell. Mother. Sonne, what thovgh yovr father wovld not haue me goe clad Now after my minde by him in gorgiovs apparrell: Women of an euil condition.Shovld I be rvled by him? nay, then I were mad, Yet had I rather with him pick a qvarrell, Thovgh I for my labovr had straight of the barrell. For to liue and goe gentle like, gallant and gay, By the masse, it is my cheefe desire alway. Robin. O mother, ye be now in a wicked minde. Seeing yov will disobay yovr hvsband for this: Yov show yovr selfe to be vnnatvrall and vnkinde, And that yov haue giuen him many a Jvdas kisse, Yovr act will declare how yov haue doon amisse. Wherfore, good mother, marke this thing well, Yet liue and goe Christian like after the Gospell. Mother. Sonne, I will liue gentle like and goe at my pleasvre, Seeing thy father for his svbstance might be a gentleman: And thovgh he were poore and had bvt little treasvre, Yet wovld I goe gallantly, say he what he can, For I wovld borrow, or els pledge pot, kettle or pan, To liue and goe gentle like, gallant and gay, A pointe of an vnthriftye Huswife. Seeing it is my cheefe desire alway. Robin. O mother, I think yov are past all shame, Yov wovld make a right good man to fret: Think yov by yovr pledging to get yov good name? Or by bringing yovr hvsband into danger or det? Fye, that either rich or poore their mindes thvs shovld set, To maintaine their pride: wherfore marke this thing well: Liue and goe Christian like after the gospell. Mother. Am I past shame, thov peelde apish boy? The brag of affinity that commeth of Nobility.Thov malapert knaue, controlest thov me? Thov shalt fare the worsse, I swere by Saint Loy, Or any that are of thy sect or propertie; Wilt thov be against my estate or degre? I come of the stocke to goe gallant and gay: Wherfore it is my cheefe desire alway. Robin. Mother, I doo not dispraise yovr stocke, Nor yet yovr owne person will I discommend, Bvt I wovld haue yov so liue to be of Christ's flocke, And so aske God mercy, with pride whom ye offend; This is the hvrt that I yov pretend. Wherfore, good mother, marke this thing well, Liue and goe Christian like after the Gospell. Mother. I pray thee, Sonne Robert, tell me no svch tale, A proude enterprise of the base sorte of some women now a dayes.For I will goe frocked and in a french hood: I will haue my fine Cassockes and my rovnd Uerdingale, Like one that came of a noble borne blood; By the masse, to think of it, it dooth my hart good, To liue and goe gentle like, gallant and gay: Oh, it is my cheefe desire alway. Robin. With Nobilitie, mother, yov may not compare, Althovgh ye be rich heere in wordly svbstance: Neither with apparrell nor yet ordinary fare, To be eqvall with them yov may not yovrselfe inhavnce; For they haue their uocation, and yov haue bvt yovr chance. Wherfore, good mother, marke this thing well: Liue and goe Christian like after the Gospell. Mother. Sonne, liue they not Christian like that banket at the wine? And goeth in their billaments of fine pearle and golde? Also with broadered haire whervnto they incline, Spending mvch yeerly this trade to vpholde, Thvs setting foorth them selues, both yong and olde. Is not this Christian like, gallant and gay? Sonne, this doo I cheefly desire alway. Robin. Christian like, mother? no, I will not so say, Bvt heathen indeed svch pompe doo vse: Marke well. Saint Pavle and Saint Peter dooth set foorth the array, What Christian women shovld take and refvse, Weare sober apparrell bvt desire no newes. Wherfore, good mother, marke this thing well: Liue and goe Christian like after the Gospell. Mother. To weare sober apparrell, what meanest thou by that? My clothes are not drunke, I wovld thou shovldst knowe: I think thov speakest by my red silk hat, Bvt and I liue another yeer, I will haue a better showe; I will not goe thvs slvttishly, I trowe. To liue and goe gentle like, gallant and gay, Seeing it is my cheefe desire alway. Robin. Mother, the sober apparrell that I do meane, Apparell for wom? both holy dayes and woorking dayes. Is sadnes, wisdome, uertve and learning: Also yovr bodily apparell is comely to be seene, For yovr degree euen now in yovr going. It is not svmptvovs apparrell that is to God's pleasing, Bvt a decent order; wherfore marke this thing well; Liue and goe Christian like after the gospell. Mother. Sonne, holde thy peace, for thy talke makes me weary; The desperat minde of wicked women.A, Robin, Robin, thov art a shrowd toward Childe: If thy father were of thy minde, I covld not be merry, Nay, I had rather be dead, by sweet Mary milde. Farwell, if thov proouest not a knaue I am begvilde. If I do not liue gentle like, to goe gallant and gay, By the masse, I wovld I were hanged vp ovt of the way. Robin. Svch a tree, svch frvte from it dooth proceed. Fye, mother, fye, that yov wish yov svch ill! Repent yovr speaking and beware of the deed, Vnlesse both yovr sovle and body yov doo kill: I feare that the deuill with yov hath wrovght his will. Now will I to my Sister to giue her some covnsell, For she hath many tricks to bring her vnto hell. Finis. She deuils are hard to tvrne. Heere Prowd Beautye beginneth to talke with Robin her Brother, for her proud fancye and wanton dallying: Very necessary to be read and marked of all Maydens that seeke the vaine glory of this world, and the vncomly trickes therin, that they may auoide the dangers therof: for feare of condemnation. The Maide. Brother Robert, yesterday, as I vnderstand, With my father and mother yov were offended: The name of Gods woord to the blasphemie therof. With her for her apparrell, and with him for his land; Thov wovldst by the gospell haue them amended; Mary, I with my selfe haue thvs pretended To be faire and feate, nice and neate, is a gay thing: To colly and kis, my pleasvre it is, for all yovr new learning. Robin. New learning, Sister? What, yov be uery bolde Thvs disdainfvlly to giue it svch a name: God's woord indeed is both new and olde, To set a woorke all things in right frame; Bvt yov boast of knackes that will bring yov to shame. Wherfore, measvre yovr pleasvre by God's woord and will, And yov shall finde that yovr minde is whorish and ill. Maide. What, whorish? yov knaue, by the blessed masse, Whore I am thvs to sweare, God giue the sorrow! Dovt not if I can bring my matters to passe, I will haue knacks indeed (yov knaue) by to morrow; Euill woords corrupt good maners. Yet will I for them neither beg, steale, nor borrow. Oh, to be faire and feate, nice and neate, is a gay thing: To colly and kis, my pleasvre it is, for all yovr new learning. Robin. Sister, it becommeth maides to be gentle of speach, Both to man, wife, and childe, whersoeuer they goe: That yovr woords and woorkes yovr children may teache To liue in the feare of God heerafter also; Wovld yov be and doo as yov list? No, sister, no. Bvt measvre yovr pleasvre by God's woord and will, And yov shall finde that yovr minde is whorish and ill. Maide. Jack savce (I say) thov lovt, thov hoddie peake, I defie thy teaching I wovld thov know: Doost thov take vpon thee to learne me speake? By the masse, bvt for shame thov shovldst beare me a blow; As I am of person so my behaviovr shall show. Oh, to be faire and feate, nice and neate, is a gay thing: To colly and kis, my pleasvre it is, for all yovr new learning. Robin. Salomon declareth this by the beavtifvll rovt, A faire woman withovt discrete manners (saith he) Is like a ring of golde on a Swines snovt, The which is a thing, sister, vncomely to see, And now svrely by yov it well may spoken be; If yov measvre yovr pleasvre by God's woord and will, Yov shall finde that yovr minde is whorish and ill. Maide. By my troth, for a knaue I will thee allow: All the dayes of thy life thov shalt be none other: Doost thov liken me and my maners vnto a sow? Mary, I defie thee, thovgh thov art my brother. Sir, my fashions doo please my father and mother. Oh, to be faire and feate, nice and neate, is a gay thing: To colly and kis, my pleasvre it is, for all yovr new learning. Robin. Sister, can yov be fayrer then God hath yov made, Feater or neater, by policye or wit? I aske yov, becavse yovr covlovr oft dooth fade, And yovr clothes uery grossely abovt yov do sit, If yov vse anything not honest and fit; Then measvre yovr pleasvre by God's woord and will, And yov shall finde that yovr minde is whorish and ill. Maide. If God make my face as browne as a berry, The prattises and motions of Sathan and are vsed of those that be his fathers darlings now a dayes. I can painte it white and rvddish withall; And if God make me looke as red as a Cherry, I can drie vp my blood with Chalke in a wall; If God make me grosse, I can pent my selfe small. To be faire and feate, nice and neate, is a gay thing: To colly and kisse, my pleasvre it is, for all yovr new learning. Robin. Oh, what a damnable euill, that either Christian or Tvrke Shovld trans-forme them selues from their first creation: What Lvcifer woman will amend God's woorke. They farre excell the Sodomites in this abomination: O pride ovt of measvre! O sathans generation! Measvre this pleasvre by God's woord and will, And yov shall finde that yovr minde is whorish and ill. Maide. The workes of the euill.Tvsh, I can dye my haire; be it neuer so black, I can make it shine like golde in a little space: Also to tire vp my head I haue svch a knack, That some maides will delight to follow my trace. I can lay ovt my haire to set ovt my face: Oh, to be faire and feate, nice and neate, is a gay thing: To colly and kisse, my pleasvre it is, for all yovr new learning. Robin. To dye and to fleare yovr haire so abroad, Svrely, sister, yov doo it shamfvlly vse: For with the Scriptvres it dooth not accord, That maides nor wiues their haire shovld so abvse; Couer it for shame: it is the vse of the stves. Therfore measvre yovr pleasvre by God's woord and will, And yov shall finde that yovr minde is whorish and ill. Maide. Brother, thov art bvt a foole me thvs to checke, The decking and balming of proud liuing Idols. For I will haue my Pomanders of most sweet smell: Also my Chaines of golde to hang abovt my necke, And my broadered haire while I at home dwell; Stomachers of golde becommeth me well. To be faire and feate, nice and neate, is a gay thing: To colly and kis, my pleasvre it is, for all yovr new learning. Robin. Sister, in the third of Esay, the Lord saith plaine, For yovr broadered hairs yov shall haue baldnes: For yovr Chaines of golde yov shall haue halters certaine For yovr Pomanders and mvske, yov shal haue stink dovtles: And for yovr stomachers, sack-cloth; this he dooth confes. Wherfore measvre yovr pleasvre by God's woord and will, And yov shall finde that yovr minde is whorish and ill. Maide. Feare and shame much sin doth tame.If the Lord plagve all those that so leade their liues, With halters and stinkings and with baldnes of head: Great shame it will be both for maidens and wiues, That so tire them selues dayly till they goe to bed; To be thvs plagved, marry, I had rather to be dead. To be faire and feate, nice and neate, is a gay thing: To colly and kis, my pleasvre it is, for all yovr new learning. Robin. Sister, yovr colling and kissing will haue an euill end; To clatter and flatter is no maidenlike way: Yovr gladnes and madnes doth God sore offend, To intice men to uice is all yovr cheefest play: In their sight yovr delight is for to goe gay. Wherfore measvre yovr pleasvre by God's woord and will, And yov shall finde that yovr minde is whorish and ill. Maide. I perceiue that thov wovldst haue me liue like a mome I will talke no more with thee, for I mvst depart; By the masse, if thov shovldst dwell long at home, My mother and I might beshrew thy hart. If thov by thy talking shovldst my father conuert, Then his welth, her pleasvre, my pastime and dallying, Were clene dispatched by this new learning. Robin. Sister, God haue yov and saue yov, if it be his pleasvre, And pretend to amend, for yovr life is now euill: Look in God's book to haue heauenly treasvre; There seek to be meek yovr provd hart to kill; Make haste for to taste of God's holy will, For it is health and welth to those that be penitent: Wherfore yet euermore delight in Christ's Testament. Finis. To talke well with some women dooth as mvch good, As a sicke man to eate vp a loade of greene wood.</field>
