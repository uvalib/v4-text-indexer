      <field name="fulltext">HOBBINOL, OR THE RURAL GAMES. Canto I. Argument of the first Canto. Proposition. Invocation address'd to Mr. John Philips Author of the Cyder Poem and Splendid Shilling. Description of the Vale of Evesham. The Seat of Hobbinol; Hobbinol a great Man in his Village, seated in his Wicker smoking his Pipe, has one only Son. Young Hobbinol's Education, bred up with Ganderetta his near Relation. Young Hobbinol and Ganderetta chosen King and Queen of May. Her Dress and Attendants. The May-Games. Twangdillo the Fidler, his Character. The Dancing. Ganderetta's extraordinary Performance. Bag-pipes good Music in the High-Lands. Milonides Master of the Ring, disciplines the Mob; proclaims the feveral Prizes. His Speech. Pastorel takes up the Belt. His Character, his Heroic Figure, his Confidence. Hobbinol, by Permission of Ganderetta, accepts the Challenge, vaults into the Ring. His honourable Behaviour, escapes a Scow'ring. Ganderetta' s Agony. Pastorel foil'd. Ganderetta not a little pleas'd. What old Menalcas at his Feast reveal'd I sing, strange Feats of antient Prowess, Deeds Of high Renown, while all his list'ning Guests With eager Joy receiv'd the pleasing Tale. O Thou! Mr. John Philips, Author of the Cyder-Poem. who late on Vaga's flow'ry Banks Slumb'ring secure, with Stirom Strong Herefordshire Cyder. well bedew'd, Fallacious Cask, in sacred Dreams wert taught By antient Seers, and Merlin Prophet old, To raise ignoble Themes with Strains sublime, Be thou my Guide! while I thy Tract pursue With Wing unequal, thro' the wide Expanse Advent'rous range, and emulate thy Flights. In that rich Vale, Vale of Evesham. where with Dobunian Fields Glocestershire. Cornavian Borders Worcestershire. meet, far fam'd of old For Montfort's Simon de Montfort kill'd at the Battle of Evesham. hapless Fate, undaunted Earl; Where from her fruitful Urn Avona pours Her kindly Torrent on the thirsty Glebe, And pillages the Hills t'inrich the Plains; On whose luxuriant Banks, Flow'rs of all Hues Start up spontaneous; and the teeming Soil With hasty Shoots prevents it's Owner's Pray'r: The pamper'd wanton Steer, of the sharp Ax Regardless, that o'er his devoted Head Hangs menacing, crops his delicious Bane, Nor knows the Price is Life; with envious Eye His lab'ring Yoke-fellow beholds his Plight, And deems him blest, while on his languid Neck In solemn Sloth he tugs the ling'ring Plough. So blind are Mortals, of each other's State Misjudging, self-deceiv'd. Here as Supreme. Stern Hobbinol in rural Plenty reigns O'er wide-extended Fields, his large Domain. Th' obsequious Villagers, with Look submiss Observant of his Eye, or when with Seed T'impregnate Earth's fat Womb, or when to bring With clam'rous Joy the bearded Harvest home. Here, when the distant Sun lengthens the Nights, When the keen Frosts the shiv'ring Farmer warn To broach his mellow Cask, and frequent Blasts Instruct the crackling Billets how to blaze, In his warm Wicker-Chair, whose pliant Twigs In close Embraces joyn'd, with spacious Arch Vault the thick-woven Roof, the bloated Churl Loiters in State, each Arm reclin'd is prop'd With yielding Pillows of the softest Down. In Mind compos'd, from short coeval Tube He sucks the Vapours bland, thick curling Clouds Of Smoak around his reeking Temples play; Joyous he sits, and impotent of Thought Puffs away Care, and Sorrow from his Heart. How vain the Pomp of Kings! Look down, ye And wiew with envious Eye the downy Nest, Where soft Repose, and calm Contentment dwell, Unbrib'd by Wealth, and unrestrain'd by Pow'r. One Son alone had blest his bridal Bed, Whom good Calista bore, nor long surviv'd To share a Mother's Joy, but left the Babe To his paternal Care. An Orphan Niece Near the same Time his dying Brother sent, To claim his kind Support. The helpless Pair In the same Cradle slept, nurs'd up with Care By the same tender Hand, on the same Breasts Alternate hung with Joy; 'till Reason dawn'd, And a new Light broke out by slow Degrees: Then on the Floor the pretty Wantons play'd, Gladding the Farmer's Heart with growing Hopes, And Pleasures erst unfelt. When e'er with Cares Oppress'd, when wearied, or alone he doz'd, Their harmless Prattle sooth'd his troubled Soul. Say, Hobbinol, What Extasies of Joy Trill'd thro' thy Veins, when climbing for a Kiss With little Palms they strok'd thy grizly Beard, Or round thy Wicker whirl'd their ratt'ling Cars? Thus from their earliest Days bred up, and train'd To mutual Fondness, with their Stature grew The thriving Passion. What Love can decay That roots so deep! Now rip'ning Manhood curl'd On the gay Stripling's Chin; her panting Breasts, And trembling Blushes glowing on her Cheeks Her secret Wish betray'd. She at each Mart All Eyes attracted; but her faithful Shade, Young Hobbinol, ne'er wander'd from her Side. A Frown from him dash'd every Rival's Hopes. For he, like Peleus Son, was prone to Rage, Inexorable, swift like him of Foot With Ease cou'd overtake his dastard Foe, Nor spar'd the suppliant Wretch. And now approach'd Those merry Days, when all the Nymphs and Swains, In folemn Festivals and rural Sports, Pay their glad Homage to the blooming Spring. Young Hobbinol by joint Consent is rais'd T'imperial Dignity, and in his Hand Bright Ganderetta tripp'd, the jovial Queen Of Maia's gaudy Month, profuse of Flow'rs. From each enamel'd Mead th' attendant Nymphs Loaded with od'rous Spoils, from these select Each Flow'r of gorgeous Die, and Garlands weave Of party-colour'd Sweets; each busy Hand Adorns the jocund Queen: In her loose Hair, That to the Winds in wanton Ringlets plays, The tufted Cowslips breath their faint Perfumes. On her refulgent Brow, as Crystal clear, As Parian Marble smooth, Narcissus hangs His drooping Head, and views his Image there, Unhappy Flow'r! Pansies of various Hue, Iris, and Hyacinth, and Asphodel, To deck the Nymph, their richest Liv'ries wear, And lavish all their Pride. Not Flora's self More lovely smiles, when to the dawning Year Her op'ning Bosom heav'nly Fragrance breaths. See on yon verdant Lawn, the gath'ring Crowd Thickens amain; the buxom Nymphs advance Usher'd by jolly Clowns; Distinctions cease Lost in the common Joy, and the bold Slave Leans on his wealthy Master, unreprov'd: The Sick no Pains can feel, no Wants the Poor. Round his fond Mother's Neck the smiling Babe Exulting clings; hard by decrepit Age Prop'd on his Staff, with anxious Thought revolves His Pleasures past, and casts his grave Remarks Among the heedless Throng. The vig'rous Youth Strips for the Combat hopeful to subdue The Fair One's long Disdain, by Valour now Glad to convince her coy erroneous Heart, And prove his Merit equal to her Charms. Soft Pity pleads his Cause; blushing she views His brawny Limbs, and his undaunted Eye, That looks a proud Defiance on his Foes. Resolv'd, and obstinately firm he stands; Danger, nor Death he fears, while the rich Prize Is Victory and Love. On the large Bough Of a thick-spreading Elm Twangdillo sits: One Leg on Ister's Banks the hardy Swain Left undismay'd, Bellona's Light'ning scorch'd His manly Visage, but in Pity left One Eye secure. He many a painful Bruise Intrepid felt, and many a gaping Wound, For brown Kate's Sake, and for his Country's Yet still the merry Bard without Regret Bears his own Ills, and with his sounding Shell, And comic Phyz, relieves his drooping Friends. Hark, from aloft his tortur'd Cat-gut squeals, He tickles ev'ry String, to ev'ry Note He bends his pliant Neck, his single Eye Twinkles with Joy, his active Stump beats Time. Let but this subtle Artist softly touch The trembling Chords, the faint expiring Swain Trembles no less, and the fond yielding Maid Is tweedled into Love. See with what Pomp The gaudy Bands advance in trim Array! Love beats in ev'ry Vein, from ev'ry Eye Darts his contagious Flames. They frisk, they bound: Now to brisk Airs, and to the speaking Strings Attentive, in Mid-way the Sexes meet; Joyous their adverse Fronts they close, and press To strict Embrace, as resolute to force And storm a Passage to each others Heart: 'Till by the varying Notes forewarn'd, back they Recoil disparted: Each with longing Eyes Pursues his Mate retiring, 'till again The blended Sexes mix; then Hand in Hand Fast lock'd, around they fly, or nimbly wheel In Mazes intricate. The jocund Troop Pleas'd with their grateful Toil, incessant shake Their uncouth brawny Limbs, and knock their Heels Sonorous; down each Brow the trickling Balm In Torrents flows, exhaling Sweets refresh The gazing Croud, and heav'nly Fragrance fills The Circuit wide. So danc'd in Days of Yore, When Orpheus play'd a Lesson to the Brutes, The list'ning Savages; the speckled Pard Dandled the Kid, and with the bounding Roe The Lion gambol'd. But what heav'nly Muse With equal Lays shall Ganderetta sing, When Goddess-like she skims the verdant Plain, Gracefully gliding? Ev'ry ravish'd Eye The Nymph attracts, and ev'ry Heart she wounds, Thee most, transported Hobbinol! Lo, now, Now to thy op'ning Arms she skuds along, With yielding Blushes glowing on her Cheeks, And Eyes that sweetly languish; but too soon, Too soon, alas! she flies thy vain Embrace, But flies to be pursu'd; nimbly she trips, And darts a Glance so tender, as she turns, That with new Hopes reliev'd, thy Joys revive, Thy Stature's rais'd, and thou art more than Man. Thy stately Port, and more majestic Air, And ev'ry sprightly Motion speaks thy Love. To the loud Bag-pipe's solemn Voice attend, Whose rising Winds proclaim a Storm is nigh. Harmonious Blasts! that warm the frozen Blood Of Caledonia's Sons to Love, or War, And chear their drooping Hearts, rob'd of the Sun's Enliv'ning Ray, that o'er the snowy Alps Reluctant peeps, and speeds to better Climes. Forthwith in hoary Majesty appears One of gigantic Size, but Visage wan, Milonides the Strong, renown'd of old For Feats of Arms, but, bending now with Years, His Trunk unwieldy from the verdant Turf He rears deliberate, and with his Plant Of toughest Virgin Oak in rising aids His trembling Limbs; his bald and wrinkled Front, Entrench'd with many a glorious Scar, bespeaks Submissive Rev'rence. He with Count'nance grim Boasts his past Deeds, and with redoubled Strokes Marshalls the Croud, and forms the Circle wide. Stern Arbiter! like some huge Rock he stands, That breaks th'incumbent Waves; they thronging press In Troops confus'd, and rear their foaming Heads Each above each, but from superior Force Shrinking repell'd, compose of stateliest View A liquid Theatre. With Hands uplift, And Voice Stentorian, he proclaims aloud Each rural Prize. “To him whose active Foot “Foils his bold Foe, and rivets him to Earth, “This Pair of Gloves, by curious Virgin Hands “Embroider'd, seam'd with Silk, and fring'd with “Gold. “To him, who best the stubborn Hilts can wield, “And bloody Marks of his Displeasure leave. “On his Opponent's Head, this Beaver white “With Silver Edging grac'd, and Scarlet Plume. “Ye taper Maidens! whose impetuous Speed “Outflies the Roe, nor bends the tender Grass, “See here this Prize, this rich lac'd Smock behold, “White as your Bosoms, as your Kisses soft. “Blest Nymph! whom bounteous Heav'n's peculiar Grace “Allots this pompous Vest, and worthy deems “To win a Virgin, and to wear a Bride.” The Gifts refulgent dazzle all the Croud, In speechless Admiration fix'd, unmov'd. Ev'n he who now each glorious Palm displays, In sullen Silence views his batter'd Limbs, And sighs his Vigour spent. Not so appall'd Young Pastorel, for active Strength renown'd: Him Ida bore, a Mountain Shepperdess; On the bleak Woald the new-born Infant lay, Expos'd to Winter Snows, and Northern Blasts Severe. As Heroes old, who from great Jove Derive their proud Descent, so might he boast His Line paternal: But be thou, my Muse! No leaky Blab, nor painful Umbrage give To wealthy 'Squire, or doughty Knight, or Peer Of high Degree. Him ev'ry shouting Ring In Triumph crown'd, him ev'ry Champion fear'd, From Kiftsgate to remotest Henbury. Two Hundreds in Glocestershire. High in the Midst the brawny Wrestler stands, A stately tow'ring Object; the tough Belt Measures his ample Breast, and shades around His Shoulders broad; proudly secure he kens The tempting Prize, in his presumptuous Thought Alre dy gain'd; with partial Look the Croud Approve his Claim: But Hobbinol enrag'd To see th'important Gifts so cheaply won, And uncontested Honours tamely lost, With lowly Rev'rence thus accosts his Queen. “Fair Goddess! be propitious to my Vows; “Smile on thy Slave, nor Hercules himself “Shall rob us of this Palm: That Boaster vain “Far other Port shall learn.” She, with a Look That pierc'd his inmost Soul, smiling applauds His gen'rous Ardour, with aspiring Hope Distends his Breast, and stirs the Man within: Yet much, alas! she fears, for much she loves. So from her Arms the Paphian Queen dismiss'd The Warriour God, on glorious Slaughter bent, Provok'd his Rage, and with her Eyes inflam'd Her haughty Paramour. Swift as the Winds Dispel the fleeting Mists, at once he strips His Royal Robes; and with a Frown that chill'd The Blood of the proud Youth, active he bounds High o'er the Heads of Multitudes reclin'd: But as beseem'd one, whose plain honest Heart, Nor Passion foul, nor Malice dark as Hell, But Honour pure, and Love divine had fir'd. His Hand presenting, on his sturdy Foe Disdainfully he smiles; then, quick as Thought, With his Left-hand the Belt, and with his Right His Shoulder seiz'd fast griping; his Right-foot Essay'd the Champion's Strength, but firm he stood, Fix'd as a Mountain-Ash, and in his Turn Repaid the bold Affront; his horny Fist Fast on his Back he clos'd, and shook in Air The cumb'rous Load. Nor Rest, nor Pause allow'd, Their watchful Eyes instruct their busy Feet; They pant, they heave, each Nerve, each Sinew's strain'd. Grasping they close, beneath each painful Gripe The livid Tumours rise, in briny Streams The Sweat distils, and from their batter'd Shins The clotted Gore distains the beaten Ground. Each Swain his Wish, each trembling Nymph conceals Her secret Dread; while ev'ry panting Breast Alternate Fears, and Hopes, depress or raise. Thus long in dubious Scale the Contest hung, 'Till Pastorel impatient of Delay, Collecting all his Force, a furious Stroke At his Left-ancle aim'd; 'twas Death to fall, To stand impossible. O Ganderetta! What Horrors seize thy Soul! on thy pale Cheeks The Roses fade. But wav'ring long in Air, Nor firm on Foot, nor as yet wholly fall'n, On his right Knee he slip'd, and nimbly 'scap'd The foul Disgrace. Thus on the slacken'd Rope The wingy-footed Artist, frail Support! Stands tott'ring; now in dreadful Shrieks the Croud Lament his sudden Fate, and yield him lost: He on his Hams, or on his brawny Rump Sliding secure, derides their vain Distress. Up starts the vig'rous Hobb'nol undismay'd, From Mother Earth like old Antæus rais'd, With Might redoubled. Clamour and Applause Shake all the neighb'ring Hills, Avona's Banks Return him loud Acclaim: With ardent Eyes, Fierce as a Tyger rushing from his Lair, He grasp'd the Wrist of his insulting Foe. Then with quick Wheel oblique, his Shoulder-Point Beneath his Breast he fix'd, and whirl'd aloft, High o'er his Head the sprawling Youth he flung: The hollow Ground rebellow'd as he fell. The Croud press forward with tumultuous Din; Those to relieve their faint expiring Friend, With Gratulations these. Hands, Tongues, and Caps, Outragious Joy proclaim, shrill Fiddles squeak, Hoarse Bag-pipes roar, and Ganderetta smiles. The End of the first Canto. CANTO II. Argument of the Second Canto. The Fray. Tonsorio, Collin, Hildebrand, Cuddy, Cindaraxa, Talgol, Avaro, Cubbin, Collakin, Mundungo. Sir Rhadamanth the Justice attended with his Guards, comes to quell the Fray. Rhadamanth' s Speech. Tumult appeas'd. Gorgonius the Butcher takes up the Hilts, his Character. The Kiftsgatians Consternation, look wistfully on Hobbinol; his Speech. The Cudgel-playing, Gorgonius knock'd down, falls upon Twangdidlo; his Distress; his Lamentation over his broken Fiddle. Long while an universal Hubbub loud, Deaf'ning each Ear, had drown'd each Accent mild; 'Till biting Taunts, and harsh opprobrious Words Vile Utt'rance found. How weak are human Minds! How impotent to stem the swelling Tide, And without Insolence enjoy Success! The Vale-Inhabitants, proud, and elate With Victory, know no Restraint, but give A Loose to Joy. Their Champion Hobbinol Vaunting they raise, above that Earth-born Race Of Giants old, who piling Hills on Hills, Pelion on Ossa, with rebellious Aim Made War on Jove. The sturdy Mountaineers, Who saw their Mightiest fall'n, and in his Fall Their Honours past impair'd, their Trophies, won By their proud Fathers, who with Scorn look'd down Upon the subject Vale, sullied, despoil'd, And level'd with the Dust, no longer bear The keen Reproach. But as when sudden Fire Seizes the ripen'd Grain, whose bending Ears Invite the Reaper's Hand, the furious God In sooty Triumph rides dreadful, upborn On Wings of Wind, that with destructive Breath Feed the fierce Flames, from Ridge to Ridge he bounds Wide-wasting, and pernicious Ruin spreads: So thro' the Croud from Breast to Breast swift flew The propagated Rage; loud vollied Oaths, Like Thunder bursting from a Cloud, gave Signs Of Wrath awak'd. Prompt Fury soon supplied With Arms uncouth; tough well-seafon'd Plants, Weighty with Lead infus'd, on either Host Fall thick, and heavy; Stools in Pieces rent, And Chairs, and Forms, and batter'd Bowls are hurl'd With fell Intent; like Bombs the Bottles fly Hissing in Air, their sharp-edg'd Fragments drench'd In the warm spouting Gore; Heaps driv'n on Heaps Promiscuous lie. Tonsorio now advanc'd On the rough Edge of Battle: His broad Front Beneath his shining Helm secure, as erst Was thine, Mambrino, stout Iberian Knight! Defied the rattling Storm, that on his Head Fell innocent. A Table's ragged Frame In his Right-hand he bore, Herculean Club! Crouds, push'd on Crouds, before his potent Arm Fled ignominious; Havock, and Dismay, Hung on their Rear. Collin a merry Swain, Blithe as the soaring Lark, as sweet the Strains Of his soft warbling Lips, that whistling chear His lab'ring Team, they toss their Heads well pleas'd, In gaudy Plumage deck'd, with stern Disdain Beheld this Victor proud; his gen'rous Soul Brook'd not the foul Disgrace. High o'er his Head His pond'rous Plough-Staff in both Hands he rais'd; Erect he stood, and stretching ev'ry Nerve, As from a forceful Engine, down it fell Upon his hollow'd Helm, that yielding sunk Beneath the Blow, and with it's sharpen'd Edge Shear'd both his Ears, they on his Shoulders broad Hung ragged. Quick as Thought the vig'rous Youth Short'ning his Staff, the other End he darts Into his gaping Jaws. Tonsorio fled Sore maim'd; with pounded Teeth and clotted Gore Half choak'd, he fled; with him the Host retir'd Companions of his Shame; all but the stout, And erst unconquer'd Hildebrand, brave Man! Bold Champion of the Hills! thy weighty Blows Our Fathers felt dismay'd; to keep thy Post Unmov'd, whilom thy Valour's Choice, now sad Necessity compels; decrepit now With Age, and stiff with honourable Wounds, He stands unterrify'd; one Crutch sustains His Frame Majestic, th'other in his Hand He wields tremendous; like a Mountain Boar In Toils inclos'd, he dares his circling Foes. They shrink aloof, or soon with Shame repent The rash Assault, the Rustic Heroes fall In Heaps around. Cuddy, a dextrous Youth, When Force was vain, on fraudful Art rely'd: Close to the Ground low cow'ring, unperceiv'd, Cautious he crept, and with his crooked Bill Cut sheer the frail Support, Prop of his Age: Reeling awhile he stood, and menac'd fierce Th'insidious Swain, reluctant now at Length Fell prone and plough'd the Dust. So the tall Oak, Old Monarch of the Groves, that long had stood The Shock of warring Winds, and the red Bolts Of angry Jove, shorn of his leafy Shade At last, and inwardly decay'd, if chance The cruel Woodman spy the friendly Spur, His only Hold; that sever'd, soon he nods, And shakes th'incumber'd Mountain as he falls. When Manly-Valour fail'd, a Female Arm Restor'd the Fight. As in th' adjacent Booth Black Cindaraxa's busy Hand prepar'd The smoaky Viands, she beheld, abash'd, The routed Host, and all her dastard Friends Far scatter'd o'er the Plain; their shameful Flight Griev'd her proud Heart, for hurry'd with the Stream Ev'n Talgol too had fled, her darling Boy. A flaming Brand from off the glowing Hearth The greasy Heroine snatch'd; o'er her pale Foes The threat'ning Meteor shone, brandish'd in Air, Or round their Heads in ruddy Circles play'd. Across the prostrate Hildebrand she strode, Dreadfully bright: The Multitude appall'd Fled diff'rent Ways, their Beards, their Hair in Flames. Imprudent she pursu'd, 'till on the Brink Of the next Pool, with Force united press'd, And waving round with huge two-handed Sway Her blazing Arms, into the muddy Lake The bold Virago fell. Dire was the Fray Between the warring Elements, of old Thus Mulciber, and Xanthus Dardan Stream In hideous Battle join'd. Just sinking now Into the boiling Deep, with suppliant Hands She beg'd for Life; black Ouse and Filth obscene Hung in her matted Hair: The shouting Croud Insult her Woes, and proud of their Success, The dripping Amazon in Triumph lead. Now, like a gath'ring Storm, the rally'd Troops Blacken'd the Plain. Young Talgol from their Front, With a fond Lover's Haste, swift as the Hind, That, by the Huntsman's Voice alarm'd, had fled, Panting returns, and seeks the gloomy Brake, Where her dear Fawn lay hid, into the Booth Impatient rush'd. But when the fatal Tale He heard, the dearest Treasure of his Soul Purloin'd, his Cindy lost; stiff'ned and pale Awhile he stood, his kindling Ire at length Burst forth implacable, and injur'd Love Shot Lightning from his Eyes; a Spit he seiz'd, Just reeking from the fat Surloyn, a long, Unweildy Spear; then with impetuous Rage Press'd forward on th'embattled Host, that shrunk At his Approach. The rich Avaro first, His fleshy Rump bor'd with dishonest Wounds, Fled bellowing; nor could his num'rous Flocks, Nor all th'aspiring Pyramids, that grace His Yard well stor'd, save the penurious Clown. Here Cubbin fell, and there young Collakin, Nor his fond Mother's Pray'rs, nor ardent Vows Of Love-sick Maids could move relentless Fate. Where e'er he raged, with his far beaming Lance He thin'd their Ranks, and all their Battle swerv'd With many an Inroad gor'd. Then cast around His furious Eyes, if haply he might find The captive Fair; her in the Dust he spy'd Grov'ling, disconsolate; those Locks, that erst So bright, shone like the polish'd Jet, defil'd With Mire impure; thither with eager Haste He ran, he flew. But when the wretched Maid Prostrate he view'd, deform'd with gaping Wounds And welt'ring in her Blood, his trembling Hand Soon drop'd the dreaded Lance; on her pale Cheeks Ghastly he gaz'd, nor felt the pealing Storm, That on his bare defenceless Brow fell thick From ev'ry Arm: O'erpower'd at last, down sunk His drooping Head, on her cold Breast reclin'd. Hail, faithful Pair! if ought my Verse avail, Nor Envy's Spite, nor Time shall e'er efface The Records of your Fame; blind British Bards, In Ages yet to come, on festal Days Shall chant this mournful Tale, while list'ning Nymphs Lament around, and ev'ry gen'rous Heart With active Valour glows, and virtuous Love. How blind is pop'lar Fury! how perverse, When Broils intestine rage, and Force controuls Reason and Law! As the torn Vessel sinks Between the Burst of adverse Waves o'erwhelm'd; So fares it with the neutral Head, between Contending Parties bruis'd, incessant peal'd With random Strokes that undiscerning fall; Guiltless he suffers most, who least offends. Mundungo from the bloody Field retir'd, Close in a Corner plied the peaceful Bowl; Incurious he, and thoughtless of Events, Now deem'd himself conceal'd, wrapt in the Cloud That issu'd from his Mouth, and the thick Fogs That hung upon his Brows; but hostile Rage Inquisitive found out the rusty Swain. His short black Tube, down his furr'd Throat impell'd, Stagg'ring he reel'd, and with tenacious Gripe The bulky Jordan, that before him stood, Seiz'd falling; that its liquid Freight disgorg'd Upon the prostrate Clown, flound'ring he lay Beneath the muddy Bev'rage whelm'd, so late His prime Delight. Thus the luxurious Wasp, Voracious Insect, by the fragrant Dregs Allur'd, and in the viscous Nectar plung'd, His filmy Pennons struggling flaps in vain, Lost in a Flood of Sweets. Still o'er the Plain Fierce Onset, and tumultuous Battle spread; And now they fall, and now they rise, incens'd With animated Rage, while nought around Is heard, but Clamour, Shout, and Female Cries, And Curses mix'd with Groans. Discord on high Shook her infernal Scourge, and o'er their Heads Scream'd with malignant Joy; when lo! between The warring Hosts appear'd Sage Rhadamanth, A Knight of high Renown. Nor Quixot bold, Nor Amadis of Gaul, nor Hudibras, Mirror of Knighthood, e'er cou'd vie with thee, Great Sultan of the Vale! Thy Front severe, As humble Indians to their Pagods bow, The Clowns submiss approach. Themis to thee Commits her golden Balance, where she weighs Th' abandon'd Orphan's Sighs, the Widows Tears; By thee gives sure Redress, comforts the Heart Oppress'd with Woe, and rears the suppliant Knee. Each bold Offender hides his guilty Head, Astonish'd, when thy delegated Arm Draws her vindictive Sword; at thy Command, Stern Minister of Power Supreme! each Ward Sends forth her brawny Myrmidons, their Clubs Blazon'd with Royal Arms; dispatchful Haste Sits earnest on each Brow, and public Care. Encompass'd round with these his dreadful Guards, He spur'd his sober Steed, grizled with Age, And venerably dull; his Stirrups stretch'd Beneath the Knightly Load; one Hand he fix'd Upon his Saddle Bow, the other Palm Before him spread, like some grave Orator In Athens, or free Rome, when Eloquence Subdu'd Mankind, and all the list'ning Croud Hung by their Ears on his persuasive Tongue. He thus the jarring Multitude address'd. “Neighbours, and Friends, and Countrymen, “the Flow'r “Of Kiftsgate! ah! what means this impious “Broil? “Is then the haughty Gaul no more your Care? “Are Landen's Plains so soon forgot, that thus “Ye spill that Blood inglorious, waste that Strength, “Which well employ'd, once more might have “compell'd “The Stripling Anjou to a shameful Flight? “Or by your great Forefathers taught, have fix'd “The British Standard on Lutetian Tow'rs? “O Sight odious, detestable! O Times “Degenerate, of ancient Honour void! “This Fact so foul, so riotous, insults “All Law, all Sov'reign Pow'r, and calls aloud “For Vengeance; but, my Friends! too well ye “know, “How slow this Arm to punish, and how bleeds “This Heart, when forc'd on rigorous Extremes. “O Countrymen! All, all, can testify “My Vigilance, my Care for public Good. “I am the Man, who by your own free Choice “Select from all the Tribes, in Senates rul'd “Each warm Debate, and emptied all my Stores “Of ancient Science in my Country's Cause. “Wise Tacitus, of Penetration deep, “Each secret Spring reveal'd, Thuanus bold “Breath'd Liberty, and all the mighty Dead, “Rais'd at my Call, the British Rights confirm'd; “While Musgrave, How, and Seymour sneer'd “in vain. “I am the Man, who from the Bench exalt “This Voice, still grateful to your Ears, this Voice “Which breaths for you alone. Where is the “Wretch “Distress'd, who in the Cobwebs of the Law “Entangl'd, and in subtil Problems lost, “Seeks not to me for Aid! In Shoals they come “Neglected, feeless Clients, nor return “Unedify'd; scarce greater Multitudes “At Delphi sought the God, to learn their Fate “From his dark Oracles. I am the Man, “Whose watchful Providence, beyond the Date “Of this frail Life extends, to future Times “Beneficent, my useful Schemes shall steer “The Common-Weal in Ages yet to come. “Your Childrens Children, taught by me, shall “keep “Their Rights inviolable: And as Rome “The Sibyl's sacred Books, tho' wrote on Leaves “And Scatter'd o'er the Ground, with pious Awe “Collected; so your Sons shall glean with Care “My hallow'd Fragments, ev'ry Scrip divine “Consult intent, of more intrinsic Worth “Than half a Vatican. Hear me, my Friends! “Hear me, my Countrymen! Oh suffer not “This hoary Head, employ'd for you alone, “To sink with Sorrow to the Grave.” He spake, And veil'd his Bonnet to the Croud. As when The Sov'reign of the Floods o'er the rough Deep His awful Trident shakes, its Fury falls, The warring Billows on each Hand retire, And foam, and rage no more. All now is hush'd, The Multitude appeas'd; a chearful Dawn Smiles on the Fields, the waving Throng subsides, And the loud Tempest sinks, becalm'd in Peace. Gorgonius now with haughty Strides advanc'd, A Gauntlet seiz'd, firm on his Guard he stood A formidable Foe, and dealt in Air His empty Blows, a Prelude to the Fight. Slaughter his Trade; full many a pamper'd Ox Fell by his fatal Hand, the bulky Beast Drag'd by his Horns, oft at one deadly Blow, His Iron Fist descending crush'd his Skull, And left him spurning on the bloody Floor, While at his Feet the guiltless Axe was laid. In dubious Fight of late one Eye he lost, Bor'd from its Orb, and the next glancing Stroke Bruis'd sore the rising Arch, and bent his Nose: Nathless he triumph'd on the well-fought Stage, Hockleian Hero! Nor was more deform'd The Cyclops blind, nor of more monstrous Size, Nor his void Orb more dreadful to behold, Weeping the putrid Gore, severe Revenge Of subtil Ithacus. Terribly gay In his Buff Doublet, larded o'er with Fat Of slaughter'd Brutes, the well-oil'd Champion shone. Sternly he gaz'd around, with many a Frown Fierce menacing, provok'd the tardy Foe. For now each Combatant, that erst so bold Vaunted his manly Deeds, in pensive Mood Hung down his Head, and fix'd on Earth his Eyes, Pale and dismay'd. On Hobbinol at last Intent they gaze, in him alone their Hope, Each Eye sollicits him, each panting Heart Joyns in the silent Suit. Soon he perceiv'd Their secret Wish, and eas'd their doubting Minds. “Ye Men of Kiftsgate! whose wide-spreading “Fame “In ancient Days were sung from Shore to Shore, “To British Bards of old a copious Theme; “Too well, alas! in your pale Cheeks I view “Your dastard Souls. O mean, degen'rate Race! “But since on me ye call, each suppliant Eye “Invites my sov'reign Aid, lo! here I come, “The Bulwark of your Fame, tho' scarce my “Brows “Are dry from glorious Toils, just now atchiev'd, “To vindicate your Worth. Lo! here I swear, “By all my great Forefathers fair Renown, “By that illustrious Wicker, where they sate “In comely Pride, and in triumphant Sloth “Gave Law to passive Clowns; or on this Spot “In Glory's Prime, your Hobbinol expires, “And from his dearest Ganderetta's Arms “Sinks to Death's cold Embrace; or by this Hand “That Stranger, big with Insolence, shall fall “Prone on the Ground, and do your Honour “Right.” Forthwith the Hilts he seiz'd, but on his Arm Fond Ganderetta hung, and round his Neck Curl'd in a soft Embrace. Honour and Love A doubtful Contest wag'd, but from her soon He sprung relentless, all her Tears were vain, Yet oft he turn'd, oft sigh'd, thus pleading mild: “Ill should I merit these imperial Robes, “Ensigns of Majesty, by gen'ral Voice “Conferr'd, should Pain, or Death itself avail “To shake the steddy Purpose of my Soul. “Peace, Fair One! Heaven will protect the Man, “By thee held dear, and crown thy gen'rous Love.” Her from the listed Field the Matrons sage Reluctant drew, and with fair Speeches sooth'd. Now Front to Front the fearless Champions meet; Gorgonius like a Tow'r, whose cloudy Top Invades the Skies, stood low'ring; far beneath The Strippling Hobbinol, with careful Eye Each Op'ning scans, and each unguarded Space Measures intent. While negligently bold, The bulky Combatant, whose Heart elate Disdain'd his puny Foe, now fondly deem'd At one decisive Stroke to win, unhurt, An easy Victory; down came at once The pond'rous Plant, with fell malicious Rage, Aim'd at his Head direct; but the tough Hilts, Swift interpos'd elude his Effort vain. The cautious Hobbinol, with ready Feet Now shifts his Ground, retreating; then again Advances bold, and his unguarded Shins Batters secure; each well-directed Blow Bites to the Quick; thick as the falling Hail, The Strokes redoubled peal his hollow Sides. The Multitude amaz'd with Horror view The rattling Storm, shrink back at ev'ry Blow, And seem to feel his Wounds; inly he groan'd, And gnash'd his Teeth, and from his Blood-shot Eye Red Lightning flash'd, the fierce tumultuous Rage Shook all his mighty Fabric; once again Erect he stands, collected, and resolv'd To conquer, or to die: Swift as the Bolt Of angry Jove, the weighty Plant descends. But wary Hobbinol, whose watchful Eye Perceiv'd his kind Intent, slip'd on one Side Declining; the vain Stroke from such an Height, With such a Force impell'd, headlong drew down Th' unweildy Champion: On the solid Ground He fell rebounding; breathless, and astunn'd, His Trunk extended lay; sore maim'd, from out His heaving Breast, he belch'd a crimson Flood. Full leisurely he rose, but conscious Shame Of Honour lost his failing Strength renew'd. Rage, and Revenge, and ever-during Hate, Blacken'd his stormy Front; rash, furious, blind, And lavish of his Blood, of random Strokes He laid on Load; without Design or Art Onward he press'd outragious, while his Foe Encircling wheels, or Inch by Inch retires, Wise Niggard of his Strength. Yet all thy Care, O Hobbinol! avail'd not to prevent One hapless Blow; o'er his strong Guard the Plant Lapp'd pliant, and its knotty Point impress'd His nervous Chine; he wreath'd him to and fro Convolv'd, yet thus distress'd, intrepid bore His Hilts aloft, and guarded well his Head. So when th' unwary Clown, with hasty Step, Crushes the folded Snake, her wounded Parts Grov'ling she trails along, but her high Crest Erect she bears; in all its speckled Pride, She swells inflam'd, and with her forky Tongue Threatens Destruction. With like eager Haste, Th' impatient Hobbinol, whose excessive Pain Stung to his Heart, a speedy Vengeance vow'd, Nor wanted long the Means; a Feint he made With well dissembled Guile, his batter'd Shins Mark'd with his Eyes, and menac'd with his Plant. Gorgonius, whose long-suff'ring Legs scarce bore His cumb'rous Bulk, to his Supporters frail Indulgent, soon the friendly Hilts oppos'd; Betray'd, deceiv'd, on his unguarded Crest The Stroke delusive fell; a dismal Groan Burst from his hollow Chest, his trembling Hands Forsook the Hilts, across the spacious Ring Backward he reel'd, the Croud affrighted fly T' escape the falling Ruin. But, alas! 'Twas thy hard Fate, Twangdillo! to receive His pond'rous Trunk; on thee, on helpless thee, Headlong, and heavy, the foul Monster fell. Beneath a Mountain's Weight, th' unhappy Bard Lay prostrate, nor was more renown'd thy Song, O Seer of Thrace! nor more severe thy Fate. His vocal Shell, the Solace and Support Of wretched Age, gave one melodious Scream, And in a thousand Fragments strow'd the Plain. The Nymphs, sure Friends to his harmonious Mirth, Fly to his Aid, his hairy Breast expose To each refreshing Gale and with soft Hands His Temples chafe; at their persuasive Touch His fleeting Soul returns, upon his Rump He sate disconsolate; but when, alas! He view'd the shatter'd Fragments, down again He sunk expiring; by their friendly Care Once more reviv'd, he thrice assay'd to speak, And thrice the rising Sobs his Voice subdu'd: 'Till thus at last his wretched Plight he mourn'd. “Sweet Instrument of Mirth! sole Comfort left “To my declining Years! whose sprightly Notes “Restor'd my Vigour, and renew'd my Bloom, “Soft healing Balm to ev'ry wounded Heart! “Despairing, dying Swains, from the cold Ground “Uprais'd by thee, at thy melodious Call, “With ravish'd Ears receiv'd the flowing Joy. “Gay Pleasantry, and Care beguiling Joke, “Thy sure Attendants were, and at thy Voice “All Nature smil'd. But, oh! this Hand no more “Shall touch thy wanton Strings, no more with Lays “Alternate, from Oblivion dark redeem “The mighty Dead, and vindicate their Fame. “Vain are thy Toils, O Hobbinol! and all “Thy Triumphs vain. Who shall record, brave “Man! “Thy bold Exploits? Who shall thy Grandeur tell, “Supreme of Kiftsgate? See thy faithful Bard, “Despoil'd, undone. O cover me, ye Hills! “Whose vocal Clifts were taught my joyous Song. “Or thou, fair Nymph, Avona! on whose Banks “The frolic Croud, led by my num'rous Strains “Their Orgies kept, and frisk'd it o'er the Green, “Jocund, and gay, while thy remurm'ring Streams “Danc'd by, well pleas'd. Oh! let thy friendly Waves “O'erwhelm a Wretch, and hide this Head accurs'd.” So plains the restless Philomel, her Nest, And callow Young, the tender growing Hope Of future Harmony, and frail Return For all her Cares, to barb'rous Churls a Prey; Darkling she sings, the Woods repeat her Moan. The End of the second Canto. CANTO III. Argument of the Third Canto. Good Eating expedient for Heroes. Homer prais'd for keeping a Table. Hobbinol triumphant. Ganderetta' s Bill of Fare. Panegyrick upon Ale. Gossipping over a Bottle. Compliment to Mr John Philips. Ganderetta' s Perplexity discover'd by Hobbinol; his consolatory Speech, compares himself to Guy Earl of Warwick. Ganderetta encouraged, strips for the Race; her amiable Figure. Fusca the Gypsy, her dirty Figure. Tabitha, her great Reputation for Speed; hired to the dissenting Academy at Tewksbury. A short Account of Gamaliel the Master, and his hopeful Scholars. Tabitha carries Weight. The Smock-Race. Tabitha' s Fall. Fusca' s short Triumph, her Humiliation. Ganderetta' s matchless Speed. Hobbinol lays the Prize at her Feet. Their mutual Triumph. The Vicissitude of human Affairs, experienc'd by Hobbinol. Mopsa, formerly his Servant, with her two Children appears to him. Mopsa' s Speech; assaults Ganderetta; her Flight. Hobbinol' s prodigious Fright, is taken into Custody by Constables, and drag'd to Sir Rhadamanth' s. Tho' some of old, and some of modern Date, Penurious their victorious Heroes fed With barren Praise alone; yet thou, my Muse! Benevolent, with more indulgent Eyes Behold th'Immortal Hobbinol; reward With due Regalement his triumphant Toils. Let Quixot's hardy Courage, and Renown, With Sancho's prudent Care be meetly join'd. O thou of Bards supreme, Mæonides! What well-fed Heroes grace thy hallow'd Page! Laden with glorious Spoils, and gay with Blood Of slaughter'd Hosts, the Victor Chief returns. Whole Troy before him fled, and Men, and Gods, Oppos'd in vain. For the brave Man, whose Arm Repell'd his Country's Wrong, ev'n he, the great Atrides, King of Kings, ev'n he prepares With his own Royal Hand the sumptuous Feast. Full to the Brim, the brazen Cauldrons smoke, Thro' all the busy Camp the rising Blaze Attest their Joy; Heroes, and Kings forego Their State, and Pride, and at his Elbow wait Obsequious. On a polish'd Charger plac'd, The bulky Chine, with plenteous Fat inlaid, Of golden Hue, magnificently shines. The choicest Morsels sever'd to the Gods, The Hero next, well-paid for all his Wounds, The rich Repast divides with Jove; from out The sparkling Bowl he draws the gen'rous Wine, Unmix'd, unmeasur'd; with unstinted Joy His Heart o'erflows. In like triumphant Port Sate the victorious Hobbinol; the Croud Transported view, and bless their glorious Chief: All Kiftsgate sounds his Praise with joint Acclaim. Him ev'ry Voice, him ev'ry Knee confess'd, In Merit, as in Right, their King. Upon The flow'ry Turf, Earth's painted Lap, are spread The rural Dainties; such as Nature boon Presents with lavish Hand, or such as owe To Ganderetta's Care their grateful Taste, Delicious. For she long since prepar'd To celebrate this Day, and with good Chear To grace his Triumphs. Crystal Gooseberries Are pil'd on Heaps; in vain the Parent-Tree Defends her luscious Fruit with pointed Spears. The ruby-tinctur'd Corinth clust'ring hangs, And emulates the Grape; green Codlings float In dulcet Creams; nor wants the last Year's Store, The hardy Nut, in solid Mail secure, Impregnable to Winter Frosts, repays Its Hoarder's Care. The Custard's gellied Flood Impatient Youth, with greedy Joy, devours. Cheesecakes and Pyes, in various Forms uprais'd, In well built Pyramids, aspiring stand. Black Hams, and Tongues, that speechless can persuade To ply the brisk Carouse, and chear the Soul With jovial Draughts. Nor does the jolly God Deny his precious Gifts; here jocund Swains, In uncouth Mirth delighted, sporting, quaff Their native Bev'rage; in the brimming Glass The liquid Amber smiles. Britons, no more Dread your invading Foes; let the false Gaul, Of Rule insatiate, potent to deceive, And great by subtil Wiles, from th'adverse Shore Pour fourth his num'rous Hosts; Iberia! join Thy tow'rings Fleets, once more aloft display Thy consecrated Banners, fill thy Sails With Pray'rs and Vows, most formidably strong In holy Trump'ry, let old Ocean groan Beneath thy proud Armada vainly deem'd Invincible; yet fruitless all their Toils, Vain ev'ry rash Effort, while our fat Glebe, Of Barley-Grain productive, still supplies The flowing Treasure, and with Sums immense Supports the Throne; while this rich Cordial warms The Farmer's Courage, arms his stubborn Soul With native Honour, and resistless Rage. Thus vaunt the Croud, each free-born Heart o'erflows With Britains Glory, and his Country's Love. Here, in a merry Knot combin'd, the Nymphs Pour out melifluous Streams, the balmy Spoils Of the laborious Bee. The modest Maid But coyly sips, and blushing drinks, abash'd: Each Lover, with observant Eye beholds Her graceful Shame, and at her glowing Cheeks Rekindles all his Fires, but Matrons sage, Better experienc'd, and instructed well In midnight Mysteries, and Feast-rites old, Grasp the capacious Bowl; nor cease to draw The spumy Nectar. Healths of gay Import Fly merrily about; now Scandal fly Insinuating gilds the specious Tale With treach'rous Praise, and with a double Face Ambiguous Wantonness demurely sneers. 'Till circling Brimmers ev'ry Veil withdraw, And dauntless Impudence appears unmask'd. Others apart, in the cool Shade retir'd, Silurian Cyder quaff, by that great Bard Ennobled, who first taught my grov'ling Muse To mount aerial. O! could I but raise My feeble Voice to his exalted Strains, Or to the Height of this great Argument, The gen'rous Liquid in each Line shou'd bounce Spirit'ous, nor oppressive Cork subdue Its foaming Rage; but to the lofty Theme Unequal, Muse, decline the pleasing Task. Thus they luxurious, on the grassy Turf, Revell'd at large: While nought around was heard But Mirth confus'd, and undistinguish'd Joy, And Laughter far resounding; serious Care Found here no Place, to Ganderetta's Breast Retiring; there with Hopes, and Fears perplex'd Her fluctuating Mind. Hence the soft Sigh Escapes unheeded, Spight of all her Art; The trembling Blushes, on her lovely Cheeks, Alternate ebb, and flow; from the full Glass She flies abstemious, shuns th'untasted Feast, But careful Hobbinol, whose am'rous Eye From hers ne'er wander'd, haunting still the Place Where his dear Treasure lay, discover'd soon Her secret Woe, and bore a Lover's Part. Compassion melts his Soul, her glowing Cheeks He kiss'd, enamour'd, and her panting Heart He press'd to his; then with these soothing Words, Tenderly smiling, her faint Hopes reviv'd. “Courage, my Fair! the splendid Prize is thine “Indulgent Fortune will not damp our Joys, “Nor blast the Glories of this happy Day. “Hear me, ye Swains! Ye Men of Kiftsgate! hear: “Tho' great the Honours by your Hands conferr'd, “These royal Ornaments, tho' great the Force “Of this puissant Arm, as all must own, “Who saw this Day the bold Gorgonius fall; “Yet were I more renown'd for Feats of Arms, “And knightly Prowess, than that mighty Guy, “So fam'd in antique Song, Warwick's great Earl “Who slew the Giant Colbrand, in fierce Fight “Maintain'd a Summer's Day, and freed this Realm “From Danish Vassalage; his pond'rous Sword, “And massy Spear, attest the glorious Deed; “Nor less his hospitable Soul is seen “In that capacious Cauldron, whose large Freight “Might feast a Province: Yet were I like him “The Nation's Pride, like him I cou'd forego “All earthly Grandeur, wander thro' the World “A jocund Pilgrim, in the lonesome Den, “And rocky Cave, with these my royal Hands “Scoop the cold Streams, with Herbs, and Roots content, “Mean Sustenance; could by this but gain, “For the dear Fair, the Prize her Heart desires. “Believe me, charming Maid! I'd be a Worm, “The meanest Insect, and the lowest Thing “The World despises, to enhance thy Fame.” So chear'd he his fair Queen, and she was chear'd. Now with a noble Confidence inspir'd, Her Looks assure Success, now strip'd of all Her cumb'rous Vestments, Beauty's vain Disguise, She shines unclouded in her native Charms. Her plaited Hair behind her in a Brede Hung careless, with becoming Grace each Blush Varied her Cheeks, than the gay rising Dawn More lovely, when the new-born Light salutes The joyful Earth, impurpling half the Skies. Her heaving Breast, thro' the thin Cov'ring view'd, Fix'd each Beholder's Eye; her taper Thighs, And Lineaments exact, wou'd mock the Skill Of Phidias; Nature alone can form Such due Proportion. To compare with her Oread, or Dryad, or of Delia's Train, Fair Virgin Huntress, for the Chace array'd With painted Quiver, and unerring Bow, Were but to lessen her superior Mien, And Goddess-like Deport. The Master's Hand Rare Artisan! with proper Shades improves His liv'ly Colouring; so here, to grace Her brighter Charms, next her upon the Plain Fusca the Brown appears, with greedy Eye Views the rich Prize, her tawny Front erects Audacious, and with her Legs unclean, Booted with Grime, and with her freckled Skin Offends the Croud. She of the Gypsy Train. Had wander'd long, and the Sun's scorching Rays Imbrown'd her Visage grim; artful to view The spreading Palm, and with vile Cant deceive The Love-sick Maid, who barters all her Store, For airy Visions and fallacious Hope. Gorgonius, if the current Fame say true, Her Comrade once, they many a merry Prank Together play'd, and many a Mile had strol'd, For him fit Mate. Next Tabitha the tall Strode o'er the Plain, with huge Gigantic Pace, And overlook'd the Croud, known far and near For matchless Speed; she many a Prize had won, Pride of that neighb'ring Tewksbury in the Vale of Evesham, where the Avon runs into the Severn. Mart, for Mustard fam'd, Sharp-biting Grain, where amicably join The Sister Floods, and with their liquid Arms Greeting embrace. Here Gamaliel sage, Of Cameronian Brood, with ruling Rod Trains up his Babes of Grace, instructed well In all the gainful Discipline of Pray'r, To point the holy Leer, by just Degrees To close the twingling Eye, t'expand the Palms, T'expose the Whites, and with the sightless Ball To glare upon the Croud, to raise, or sink The docile Voice, now murm'ring soft and low With inward Accent calm, and then again In soaming Floods of rapt'rous Eloquence, Let loose the Storm, and thunder thro' the Nose The threat'ned Vengeance: Ev'ry Muse profane Is banish'd hence, and Heliconian Streams Deserted, the fam'd Leman Lake supplies More plenteous Draughts, of more divine Import. Hail, happy Youths! on whom indulgent Heav'n Each Grace divine bestows, nor yet denies Carnal Beatitudes, sweet Privilege Of Saints elect! Royal Prerogative! Here in domestic Cares employ'd and bound To annual Servitude, frail Tabitha Her pristin Vigour lost, now mourns in vain Her sharpen'd Visage, and the sickly Qualms That grieve her Soul; a Prey to Love, while Grace Slept heedless by: Yet her undaunted Mind Still meditates the Prize, and still she hopes, Beneath th'unweildy Load, her wonted Speed. Others of meaner Fame the stately Muse Records not, on more lofty Flights intent She spurns the Ground, and mounts her native Skies. Room for the Master of the Ring; ye Swains! Divide your crouded Ranks. See! there on high The glitt'ring Prize, on the tall Standard born, Waving in Air; before him march in Files The rural Minstrilsy, the rattling Drum Of solemn Sound, and th' animating Horn, Each Huntsman's Joy; the Tabor and the Pipe, Companion dear at Feasts, whose chearful Notes Give Life, and Motion to th'unweildy Clown. Ev'n Age revives, and the pale puking Maid Feels ruddy Health rekindling on her Cheeks, And with new Vigour trips it o'er the Plain. Counting each careful Step, he paces o'er Th' allotted Ground, and fixes at the Goal His Standard, there himself majestic swells. Stretch'd in a Line, the panting Rivals wait Th'expected Signal, with impatient Eyes Measure the Space between, and in Conceit Already grasp the warm-contested Prize. Now all at once rush forward to the Goal, And Step by Step, and Side by Side, they ply Their busy Feet, and leave the Croud behind. Quick heaves each Breast, and quick they shoot along, Thro' the divided Air, and bound it o'er the Plain. To this, to that, capricious Fortune deals Short Hopes, short Fears, and momentary Joy. The breathless Throng, with open Throats pursue, And broken Accents shout imperfect Praise. Such Noise confus'd is heard, such wild Uproar, When on the Main the swelling Surges rise, Dash o'er the Rocks, and hurrying thro' the Flood, Drive on each others Backs, and croud the Strand. Before the rest tall Tabitha was seen, Stretching amain, and whirling o'er the Field; Swift as the shooting Star, that gilds the Night With rapid transient Blaze, she runs, she flies; Sudden she stops, nor longer can endure The painful Course, but drooping sinks away, And like that falling Meteor, there she lyes A Jelly cold on Earth. Fusca with Joy, Beheld her wretched Plight; o'er the pale Corse Insulting bounds; Hope gave her Wings, and now Exerting all her Speed, Step after Step, At Ganderetta's Elbow urg'd her Way, Her Shoulder pressing, and with pois'nous Breath Tainting her Iv'ry Neck. Long while had held The sharp Contest, had not propitious Heav'n With partial Hands to such transcendent Charms Dispens'd its Favours. For as o'er the Green The careless Gypsy, with incautious Speed, Push'd forward, and her Rival Fair had reach'd With equal Pace, and only not o'erpass'd: Haply she treads, where late the merry Train, In wasteful Luxury, and wanton Joy Lavish had spilt the Cyder's frothy Flood, And Mead with Custard mix'd. Surpriz'd appall'd, And in the treach'rous Puddle struggling long, She slip'd, she fell, upon her Back supine Extended lay; the laughing Multitude With noisy Scorn approve her just Disgrace. As the slick Lev'ret skims before the Pack, So flies the Nymph, and so the Croud pursue. Born on the Wings of Wind the Dear One flies, Swift as the various Goddess, nor less bright In Beauty's Prime; when thro' the yielding Air She darts along, and with refracted Rays Paints the gay Clouds; celestial Messenger, Charg'd with the high Behests of Heav'n's great Queen! Her at the Goal with open Arms receiv'd Fond Hobbinol; with active Leap he seiz'd The costly Prize, and laid it at her Feet. Then pausing stood, dumb with Excess of Joy, Expressive Silence! for each tender Glance Betray'd the Raptures, that his Tongue conceal'd. Less mute the Croud, in echoing Shouts, applaud Her Speed, her Beauty, his obsequious Love, Upon a little Eminence, whose Top O'erlook'd the Plain, a steep, but short Ascent, Plac'd in a Chair of State, with Garlands crown'd, And loaded with the Fragrance of the Spring, Fair Ganderetta shone; like Mother Eve In her gay Sylvan Lodge, delicious Bow'r! Where Nature's wanton Hand, above the Reach Of Rule, or Art, had lavish'd all her Store, To deck the flow'ry Roof; and at her Side, Imperial Hobbinol, with Front sublime, Great as a Roman Consul, just return'd From Cities sack'd, and Provinces laid waste, In his paternal Wicker sate, enthron'd, With eager Eyes the Croud about them press, Ambitious to behold the happy Pair. Each Voice, each Instrument, proclaims their Joy With loudest Vehemence: Such Noise is heard, Such a tumultuous Din, when, at the Call Of Britain's Sovereign, the Rustic Bands O'erspread the Fields; the subtil Candidates Dissembled Homage pay, and court the Fools Whom they despise; each proud majestic Clown Looks big, and shouts amain, mad with the Taste Of Pow'r Supreme, frail Empire of a Day! That with the setting Sun extinct is lost. Nor is thy Grandeur, mighty Hobbinol! Of longer Date. Short is alas! the Reign Of mortal Pride: We play our Parts a while, And strut upon the Stage; the Scene is chang'd, And offers us a Dungeon for a Throne. Wretched Vicissitude! for after all His tinsel Dreams of Empire and Renown, Fortune, capricious Dame, withdraws at once The goodly Prospect, to his Eyes presents Her, whom his conscious Soul abhorr'd and fear'd. Lo! pushing thro' the Croud, a meagre Form, With hasty Step, and Visage incompos'd! Wildly she star'd; Rage sparkled in her Eyes, And Proverty sate shrinking on her Cheeks. Yet thro' the Cloud that hung upon her Brows, A faded Lustre broke, that dimly shone Shorn of its Beams, the Ruins of a Face, Impair'd by Time, and shatter'd by Misfortunes. A froward Babe hung at her flabby Breast, And tug'd for Life; but wept, with hideous Moan, His frustrate Hopes, and unavailing Pains. Another o'er her bending Shoulder peep'd, Swaddled around with Rags of various Hue. He kens his Comrade-Twin with envious Eye, As of his Share defrauded; then amain He also screams, and to his Brother's Cries, In doleful Consort joins his loud Laments. O dire Effect of lawless Love! O Sting Of Pleasures past! As when a full-freight Ship, Blest in a rich Return of Pearl, or Gold, Or fragrant Spice, or Silks of costly Die, Makes to the wish'd-for Port with swelling Sails, And all her gaudy Trim display'd; o'erjoy'd The Master smiles; but if from some small Creek, A lurking Corsair the rich Quarry spies, With all her Sails bears down upon her Prey, And Peals of Thunder from her hollow Sides Check his triumphant Course; agast he stands, Stiffen'd with Fear, unable to resist, And impotent to fly; all his fond Hopes Are dash'd at once; nought now, alas! remains But the sad Choice of Slavery, or Death. So far'd it with the hapless Hobbinol, In the full Blaze of his triumphant Joy Surpris'd by her, whose dreadful Face alone Cou'd shake his stedfast Soul. In vain he turns, And shifts his Place averse; she haunts him still, And glares upon him with her haggard Eyes, That fiercely spoke her Wrongs. Words swell'd with Sighs At length burst forth, and thus she storms enrag'd. “Know'st thou not me? false Man! not to “know me “Argues thyself unknowing of thyself, “Puff'd up with Pride, and bloated with Success. “Is injur'd Mopsa then so soon forgot? “Thou knew'st me once, ah! woe is me! thou did'st. “But if labourious Days, and sleepless Nights, “If Hunger, Cold, Contempt, and Penury, “Inseparable Guests, have thus disguis'd “Thy once belov'd, thy Hand-maid dear; if thine “And Fortune's Frowns have blasted all my Charms; “If here no Roses grow, no Lillies bloom, “Nor rear their Heads on this neglected Face; “If thro' the World I range a flighted Shade, “The Ghost of what I was, forlorn, unknown; “At least know these. See! this sweet-simp'ring Babe, “Dear Image of thyself; see! how it sprunts “With Joy at thy Approach! see, how it gilds “Its soft smooth Face, with false paternal Smiles! “Native Deceit, from thee, base Man, deriv'd! “Or view this other Elf, in ev'ry Art “Of smiling Fraud, in ev'ry treach'rous Leer, “The very Hobbinol! Ah! cruel Man! “Wicked, ingrate! And cou'd'st thou then so soon, “So soon forget that pleasing fatal Night, “When me beneath the flow'ry Thorn surpriz'd, “Thy artful Wiles betray'd? Was there a Star, “By which thou didst not swear? Was there a Curse, “A Plague on Earth, thou didst not then invoke “On that devoted Head; if e'er thy Heart “Prov'd haggard to my Love, if e'er thy Hand “Declin'd the nuptial Bond? But, oh! too well, “Too well alas! my throbbing Breast perceiv'd “The black impending Storm; the conscious Moon “Veil'd in a sable Cloud her modest Face, “And boding Owls proclaim'd the dire Event. “And yet I love thee,—Oh! cou'd'st thou behold “That Image dwelling in my Heart! But why? “Why waste I here these unavailing Tears? “On this thy Minion, on this tawdry Thing, “On this gay Victim, thus with Garlands crown'd, “All, all, my Vengeance fall! Ye Lightnings blast “That Face accurs'd, the Source of all my Woe! “Arm, arm, ye Furies! arm; all Hell break loose! “While thus I lead you to my just Revenge, “And thus”—Upstarts th'astonish'd Hobbinol To save his better Half. “Fly, fly, he cries, “Fly, my dear Life, the Fiend's malicious Rage.” Born on the Wings of Fear away she bounds, And in the neighb'ring Village pants forlorn. So the cours'd Hare to the close Covert flies, Still trembling, tho' secure. Poor Hobbinol More grievous Ills attend, around him press A Multitude, with huge Herculean Clubs, Terrific Band! the Royal Mandate these Insulting shew: Arrested, and amaz'd, Half dead he stands; no Friends dare interpose But bow dejected to th' Imperial Scroll. Such is the Force of Law. While conscious Shame Sits heavy on his Brow, they view the Wretch To Rhadamanth's august Tribunal drag'd. Good Rhadamanth! to ev'ry wanton Clown Severe, indulgent to himself alone. FINIS.</field>
