Every where/the mischefe of you all. Ferre and nere/breaketh oute very fast Godde will nedes be revenged at the last. Howe longe haue ye the worlde captyued In sore bondage/of mennes tradiciones? Kynges and Emperoures/ye haue depryued Lewedly vsurpynge/their chefe possessiones. Muche misery ye make/in all regiones. Nowe youre fraudes/almoste at the latter cast Of godde sore to be revenged at the last. Poore people to oppresse/ye haue no shame O wakynge for feare/of your doubble tyranny. Rightfull iustice ye haue put out of frame Sekynge the lust of youre godde/the belly. Therfore I dare you boldely certifye. Very litle though ye be therof a gast Yet god will be revenged ar the last. [O Christen reder/from rashnes refraine] O Christen reder/from rashnes refraine Of hastye iudgem?t/&amp; lyght sentence. though s? reck? it frowardnes of brayne Thus to detecte y? clergyes inc?ueni?ce. Vnto christes wordes geue/thou aduertence Which saieth nothinge to be done so secretly But it shall be knowen manifestly. Where as men discerne no grefe of darcknes Full litle is desyred the confortable lyght The daye is restrayned to shewe his clerenes Tyll the clowdes be expelled of the night As longe as we perceyue not wronge fr? right Nether holynes from false hypocrisye The truthe can not be knowen manifestly. Cursed they are/as Esaye dothe expresse Which presume the euyll for good to comm?de Sayenge that swete is soure/&amp; light darcknes As nowe in the clergye/we may perpende. Whos disguysed madnes in the later ende As seynt Paule to Timothe did prophesye Shall be knowen to all men manifestly. Example of twayne he dothe there recyte Whos names were called J?nes &amp; Iambres Which by enchauntm?t/through deuels might Strongely resisted the prophete Moyses. Doynge lyke merueyles and wonderfulnes So that none could the very trouth espye Tyll their Iugglynge was knowen manifestly Christe/like wise/with his predicacion The phariseyes shewynge outwarde holynes Was a counted of small reputacion Vyce cloked vnder shone of vertuousnes. Vntill at the last their furiousnes Accusyng the woman taken in aduoutery They sawe their fautes detecte manifestly. Their vyces opened/they could not abyde Shame drevynge them to confusyon Which afore season through pope holy pryde They bolstred out vnder abusyon It is the practyse of their collusyon. Zele of rightuousnes to fayne outwardly Tyll their fautes be detecte manifestly/ Which in oure clergye is evidently sene Fayned godlynes falsly pretendynge Wherby moste parte of people do wene That they seke goddes honour in all thinge How be it/men shuld se that their sekynge Is to confounde christes gospell vtterly Were their fautes detecte manifestly. What greater despyte can they ymagine/ Agaynst god his hye honour to deface Than to vsurpe on them his power diuine Abhominably sittinge in holy place? Which hath continued longe tyme &amp; space And shall with outragious blasphemy Till their fautes be detecte manifestly. Scripture vnto them was first proferyd Mekely without any prouocacion. Which to receyue when it was offeryd They refused with indignacion. Wherfore touchinge their reformacion. Litle trust is to be had certaynly Tyll their fautes be detecte manifestly. Thus to conclude/o christen reder Vnto pacience/I the exhorte. Aduertesynge/howe &amp; in what maner Christe rebuked this pharisaycall sorte. Whom as Mathew in the .xxiij. doth reporte. With fearefull sentence he cursed ernestly Their wicked fautes detectynge manifestly. Nihil est opertum ? n? reueletur. Mtah. x. Here foloweth the Dialoge/the Gentillm? beg?n?ge first his c?playnte. Gentillman. With soroufull harte/maye I c?playne C?cerninge the chaunce/of my misery Although parau?ture it is but vayne Trueth oporessyd/with open tyranny. My enheritaunce and patrimony. Agaynst right/from me they kepe awaye Which saye/for my frendes soules they praye. Myne aunceteres of worthy progeny With rentes and lyuelood largely endued Mayntayned their estates honorably Aydynge the poore/indigence to exclude. Tyll at the last/the clergy to them sued. Pretendinge godlynes/vnder a fals waye Sayenge they wold for their soules praye. Stoutely they alleged before their syght Howe after this lyfe is a purgatory. Wherin their soules both daye &amp; night Shuld be tormented with out memory Excepte of their substaunce transitory. Vnto their seactes/they wold some what paye Sayenge that they wold for their soules praye. They bare them in hande that they had myght Synners to bynde &amp; loose at their owne plesure Takynge vpon them to leade thyem a right Vnto ioye/that euer shuld endure. Of popes pardones they boosted the treasure. Chalengynge of heuene &amp; hell the kaye Sayenge/that they wold for their soules praye. To trust wife or childern/they did disswade Eyther any frendes or persones temporall. Affermynge/that oure loue shuld a way vade Without any memory of them at all Onely to hope in their seactes spirituall. They entyced/with persuasiones gaye Sayenge that they wold for their soules praye. Thus with wylines and argumentes vayne Myne aunceters brought in to perplexite Partely thorough feare of eternall payne And partely for desyre of felicite. They consented makynge no difficulte To graunte their requestes without delaye Sayenge that they wold for their soules praye Their chefe lordshippes and londes principall With c?modytes of their possessyon Vnto the clergye they gaue forthe with all Dysheretinge their right successyon. Which to receiue without excepcion The couetous clergy made no denay Sayenge that they wold for their soules pray By the meanes wherof/I and suche other Suffrynge the extremyte of indigence Are occasioned to theft or mourder Fallynge in to moche inconuenience. Because the clergye agaynst conscience Deuoureth oure possessiones nighte and daye Sayeng y? for oure frendes soules they praye. I haue wife and childern vpon my hande Wantinge substaunce/their lifes to sustayne Wherfore to the clergy that haue my lande Sometyme I come and pituously complayne Whos statelines/to helpe me hauyng disdayne With oute any comforte to me they saye That for my frendes soules they dayly praye. Shuld I and my houshold for houngre dye They wold not an halfe peny with vs parte So that they lyue in welthe aboundantly Full litle they regarde oure woofull smerte. To waste oure goodes they nothinge aduerte In vicious lustes and pompous araye Sayenge y? for our frendes soules they praye. They take vpon them apostles auctorite But they folowe nothinge their profession Often tymes they preache of christes pouerte Howe be it towarde it they haue no affeccion. Yf so be they pleate ones in possession Harde it is to get ought fro them awaye Sayenge/that for our fr?des soules they praye. Thus must we beare their oppression Whiles to complayne there is no remedye The worlde they haue brought in subiection Vnder their ambicious tyranny. No respecte they haue to the mysery Of vs poore gentillmen that be laye Sayenge that for our fr?des soules they praye. Alas/is it not a myserable case? To se ydle persones voyde of pyte Occupyenge the landes before oure face Which shuld pertayne vnto vs of duete. They haue richesse/and we calamyte Their honour encreaced/oures must dekaye Sayenge that for our fr?des soules they praye. The husbandman. Syr/god geue you good morowe I perceiue the cause of youre sorowe And most lamentable calamyte. Is for the oppression intollerable Of thes monstres so vncharitable Whom men call the spiritualte. Trouthe it is/ye poore gentillmen are By their craftynes made nedy and bare Your landes with holdinge by violence How be it we husbandmen euery where Are nowe in worsse condicion ferre As it may be marked by experience. Gentillman. In worse caas? nay/that can not be so For loke ouer the hoole worlde to and fro Namely here in oure owne region. And thou shalt fynde that in their handes Remayneth the chefe lordeshippes and landes Of poore gentillmens possession. They haue oure aunceters lyuelood and rentes Their principall fearmes and teneamentes With temporall fredomes and libertees. They haue gotten vnto their kingdomes Many noble baronries and erldomes With esquyres landes and knightes fees. Husbondeman. Notwithstondinge yet they saye precysely That your Aunceters gaue to theym freely Soche worldly dominion and lyuelood. Gentillman. Freely quod a?nay/that is but fayned For they ware certeynly therto constreyned By their couetous disceite and falshod Husbondman. Howe dyd they youre aunceteres compell? Gentillman. Mary in threatnynge the paynes of hell And sharpe punishment of purgatorye. Wher to brenne/they made them beleue Excepte they wolde vnto them geue Parte of their substaunce &amp; patrimony. Husbondeman. But howe wold they delyuer them fro thence? Gentillman. As they saide by their prayers assistence Which with boostynge wordes they dyd alowe Husbondman. Prayer? god geue her a shamefull reprefe For it is the moost briberynge thefe. That euer was/I make god a vowe. For by her the clergy without dowte Robbeth the hole countre rounde aboute Bothe comones and estates none excepte. I wote they haue prayed so longe all redy That they haue brought the lande to beggery And all thryftynes clene awaye swepte. What soeuer we get with sweate and labour That prolle they awaye with their prayour Sayenge they praye for oure soules allwaye But is their prayer not more avaylynge To the deade soules/than to the lyuynge So is it not worthe a rotten aye. Gentillman. To the soules departed it is not profitable For whye/thos that are in case dampnable No assistence of prayour can attayne. And as for purgatory ther is none All though there be clerkes many one Which to seke it take moche payne. Husbondman. Than I wold their prayenge were at an ende For yf they pray longe thus so god me mende They shall make y? lande worsse than nought. But nowe I will rehearce seriously Howe we husbandemen full pituously Vnto miserable wrechednes are brought. Fyrst whan englonde was in his floures Ordred by the temporall gouernoures Knowenge no spirituall iurisdiccion. Than was ther in eche state and degre Haboundance and plentuous prosperite Peaceable welthe without affliccion. Noblenes of blood/was had in price Vertuousnes avaunced/hated was vyce Princes obeyd/with due reuerence. Artificers and men of occupacion Quietly wanne their sustentacion Without any grefe of nedy indigence. We husband men lyke wise prosperously Occupyenge the feates of husbandry Hyerd fearmes of pryce competent. Wherby oure lyuinge honestly we wanne And had ynough to paye euery manne Helpinge other that were indigent. Tyll at the last the rauenous clergye Through their craftynes and hypocrisye Gate to theym worldly dominacion. Than were we ouercharged very sore Oure fearmes set vp dayly more and more With shamefull pryce in soche a fasshyon. That we paye more nowe by halfe the sume Than a fore tymes we dyd of custome Holdinge ought of their possession. Besyde this/other contentes of brybery As payenge of tythes/open and preuy And for herynge of confession. Also prestes dueties and clerkes wages Byenge of perdones and freres quarterages With chirches and aultares reparacion. All oure charges can not be nombred Wherwith we are greatly acombred Ouer whelmyd with desolacion. We tourmoyle oure selfes nyght and daye And are fayne to dryncke whygge and whaye For to maynteyne the clargyes facciones Gentillman. This were a great shame to be knowen Seynge halfe the realme is their owne That they charge you with soche exaccions. Me thyncketh so to do is no small cryme For they kepte as good houses a foretyme Whiles theyr fearme hyers was ferre lesse. Husbandman. Ye/more plentuous houses a great deale How be yt in hyndrynge the comone weale They vse also this practyse doutles. Where as poore husband men afore season Accordinge vnto equite and reason House or lande to fearme dyd desyre. Without any difficulte they might it get And yet no hygher price was ther vp set Than good conscience did require. But nowe their ambicious suttlete Maketh one fearme of two or thre Ye some tyme they bringe .vi. to one. Which to gentillmen they let in farmage Or elles to ryche marchauntes for avauntage To the vndoynge of husbandeman ech one. Wherby the comones sufferinge damage The hole lande is brought in to rerage As by experience ye may well see. Thus is the wealth of village and towne With the fame of honorable renowne Fallen in to myserable pouerte. Plentnous housholdes hereby ar dekayde Relefe of poore people is awaye strayde Allmes exyled with hospitalyte. By soche meanes/all thinge waxeth dere Complaynte of subiectes cryenge ferre and nere Oppressed with greuous calamyte. Gentillman. Truely thou shewest the very abuse Neuerthelesse concernynge oure excuse Why we gentillmen fearmes occupye. The principall occasion is onely this That oure patrimony geuen awaye is Vnto thes wolffes of the clergye. By whos oppression we are so beggeryd That necessite hath vs compellyd With fearmes soche shyft to make. For as ye husbandmen can well vnderstande Touchinge expences and charges of the lande They disdayne any parte with vs to take. Husbandman. Ye by seynte Marye/I you warrante In soche cases/their ayde is very scant Makinge curtesye to do any goode. Let the realme go what way it wull They hauynge ease/and their belyes full Regarde litle the comone weale by the rode Yf princes demaunde their succour or ayde This answere of them is comonely saide We are pore bedemen of youre grace. We praye for your disceaced auncetryes For whom we synge masses and dirigees To succour their soules in nedefull case. Gentillman. Oh/they afoorde prayers good cheape Sayenge rather many masses by heape Than to geue a poore man his dyner. Wherfore as thou saydest/so god helpe me I se of their prayenge no comodyte Nether avauntage in any maner. For whye with in thes .iiij. hundred yere Thorough oute christendome was not a freer Of thes/whom we mendicantes call. And syth that tyme dyuers facciones Of collegianes/monkes and chanones Haue spred this region ouer all. Also of prestes/were not the tenthe parte Which as they saye/haue none other arte But for vs worldly people to praye. And yet the worlde is nowe farre worsse As euery man felyth in his poorsse Than it was at that tyme I dare saye. Wherfore the trueth openly to betryde I wolde they shuld laye their prayenge a syde And geue theym selfes to labour bodely. Husbandman. It were harde to bringe theym therto Vtterly refusynge any labour to do Because they are people gostely. Gentillman. Were not the apostles gostely also? Husbandman. Yes syr/but it is so longe ago That their lyuynge is oute of memorye. Gentillman. We fynde it well in the newe testament. Husbandman. The clargye saye/it is not conuenyent For laye men therwith to be busye. Gentillman. Wotest thou wherfore they do that? Husbondman. In fayth syr I coniecture some what And I suppose I do not moche erre. Might men the scripture in Englishe rede We secular people shuld than se in dede What Christ and the apostles lyues were. Which I dout nothinge are contrarye Vnto the lyuynge of oure clargye Geuyn to pompous ydlenes euery where. Whos abhominacion ones knowen Their pryde shuld be sone ouer throwen And fewe wold their statelynes for beare. Gentyllman. Thou hyttest the nayle vpon the heed For that is the thinge that they dreed Least scripture shuld come vnto light. God commaundyd man in the begynnynge With sweat of vysage to wynne his lyuynge As Moses in his fyrst boke dothe wryte. And as Marcke sayeth in the .vi. chapter Christe here vpon erthe was a carpenter Not dysdayninge an occupacion. Also the disciples vniuersally With their handes laboured busyly Exchewynge ydle conuersacion. Husbandman. Oure clargye lyue nothynge after their rate Gentillman. No/they seke ydelly to auaunce their estate And to be had in reputacyon. Husbondman. Are they worldly or gostely to saye the trothe? Gentyllman. So god helpe me I trowe none of bothe As it apperyth by their fasshion. For in matters of worldly busynes The clergye haue moche more entresse Than temporall men I ensure the. The landes of lordes and dukes to possesse Thei abasshe not a whit the seculernes Chalengynge tytles of worldly honour But is the realme in any necessyte Where as they shuld condescend of duete To stande by their prince with succour Than to be of the world they denye Sayenge that their helpe is spiritually From the worlde makinge a separacion. Husbandman. Whiles they vse soche craftynes to contryue The temporalte ought theym to depryue Of their worldly dominacyon. And euen as they saye that they are gostely So without any assistence worldly To lyue gostely they shuld haue no let. Gentillman. That were an expedyent medicyne Accordinge vnto saynt Paules doctryne Qui non laborat/non manducet. Nowithstonding their power is so stronge That whether they do ryght or wronge They haue their owne will without fayle. Their enormytees so ferre out breaketh That all the worlde agaynst theym speaketh But alas man what dothe it avayle? Husbondman. The remedy that I can ymagyne Were best that we together determyne To get vs to london incontynent. Where as it is here for a surete tolde The kinge with his nobles dothe holde A generall counsell or parlament. Gentillman. What woldest thou that we shuld do there? Husbondman. The constraynte of oure myserye to declare Vnder a meke forme of lamentacion. Gentillman. So shuld we be sure of soche answeres As were made vnto the poore beggers For their pituous supplicacyon. Against wh? y? clergyes resons nought worthe The soules of purgatory they brought forthe The beggers complaynte to discomfyte. Wherfore against oure peticion I the tell They wold bringe out all the deuells in hell For to do vs some shamefull despyte. Husbondman. And was ther none other waye at all But the soules of purgatory to call In ayde and assistence of the clergye. Gentillman. It was the suerest waye by seynt Ihone For had they to playne scripture gone I wousse they hadde be taken tardye. The beggers complaynte was so grounded That the clargye hadde be confounded Had they not to purgatory hasted. Husbondman. Where sayd they purgatorye shuld be? Gentillman. By scripture they shewed no certente Albeit with stowte wordes they it faced. Euen like vnto the man/which went A certeyne straunge ylonde to inuent But whan he sawe he could it not fynde, Least his wit &amp; travaile shuld seme in vayne Reporte of other men he beganne to fayne The symplicite of rude people to blynde. But touchinge oure communicacion Ther is a nother consideracion Which somewhat more troubleth my mynde. Thou knowest that in the parlament The chefe of y? clergye are resident In a maruelous great multitude. Whos fearce displeasure is so terrible That I iudge it were not possible Any cause against them to conclude. As for this ones we shall not be herde And great men I tell the are a ferde With them to haue any doynge. Whosoeuer will agaynst them contende Shall be sure of a mischefe in the ende Is he gentillman lorde or kynge. And that vnto kynge Ihon I me reporte With other princes &amp; lordes a great sorte Whom the cronycles expresse by name. Whiles they were a lyue they did them trouble And after their deathe with cruelnes double They ceased not their honour to diffame. Dyd not they so longe striue &amp; wrastle Against the good knight syr Ihon oldecastle Other wise called lorde of Cobham. That from hyghe heresye vnto treasone They brought him to fynall destruction With other many a noble man. Moreouer at seynt Edm?des bury some saye That the famous prince duke Humfray By them of his lyfe was abreuiate. Sythe that tyme I coulde recken mo Whom they caused to be dispatched so Parauenture some of no lowe estate. The husbandman. Their tyranny is great without fayle Neuerthelesse yf we wold them assayle With argumentes of the holy gospell. They shuld not be ones able to resiste For the wordes of oure sauiour christe Shuld stoppe them were they neuer so fell. Who in the .xxiij. chapter of seynt Luke To their great confusyon and rebuke Forbydeth secular ambicion. Wherin he himselfe example gaue Contempnynge worldly honour to haue Of this world claymynge no kingdome. Also when his disciples forthe he sent He commaunded them to be content With foode and apparayle necessary. Wherto saint Paules doctrine accordinge Saieth: hauynge meate drinke and clothinge We shuld no thinge couet superfluously. Gentillman. Yf the holy gospell allege we shuld As stronge heretike stake vs they would Vnto their churche disobedient. For why they haue commaunded straytely That none vnder great payne be so hardye To haue in englishe the testament. Which as thou knowest at London The bisshop makinge ther a sermon With shamefull blasphemy was brent. Husbondeman. Alas that cruelte goeth to my hert Wherfor I feare me we shall all smert At lengthe with bitter punisshment. Gentillman. Vndouted it is greatly to be fearyd Least the hole region shalbe plagyd For their outragious blasphemy. In kynge Henryes dayes of that name y? fyft The clergye their pride aboue to lyft Persecuted christen brothers haynously. The gospell of Christ a syde to cast Which at that tyme prospered fast. With all their puysa?ce they dyd conspyre. Euery where they threwe theym in presones In sharpe gayles/and horrible doungeones Causynge many to be brent in fyre. Their furious malice neuer stentyd Tyll they had the light oute quenchyd Of the gospell and holy scripture. Wherof all bokes that they could get They caused on a fayre fyre to be set To expell goddes worde doynge their cure. But consyder what ther of did chaunce Moste terrible plages of fearfull vengeaunce And endles sorowe to oure nacion. For within shorte season after they lost Which many a mans lyfe dyd cost In fraunce their dominacion. Amonge them selfes moste hatefull mourdre Many stronge batayles/one after a nother With great effusyon of englisshe bloode. Frende against fr?de/brother against brother. Euery man at variaunce with other The realme longe season in myschefe stoode Husbondman. This is nowe a dayes clene oute of mynde Gentillman. I praye god/hereafter we do not fynde The same vengeaunce for like offence For as it is in the byble playnely red God left neuer lande yet vnpunished Which agaynst his worde made resistence. Husbondman. Well syr/yf scripture ye; forthe bringe I beseche you/what is their answeringe Are they so bolde goddes worde to denye? Gentillman. Naye but after their ymaginacion They make there of an interpretacion Vnto the texte clene contrary They allege the popes auctorite Customes of auncyent antiquite With diuers counseiles approbacion. Also the holynes of religious fathers With the bloode sheadinge of marters For their chirches preservacion. Besyde that contynuaunce of yeres Myracles of bishoppes/monkes and freres Whom for speciall patrones they holde. And fynally to make a conclusion In fortefyenge their abusion Other practyses they vse manyfolde. They resorte to lordes and great estates With whom they are dayly checke mates Ye to saye the trouthe their soueraynes. Where amonge other communicacion They admonishe them with protestacion To beware of thes heretikes Lutheranes. Whom they saye is a secte newe fangled With execrable heresyes entangled Sekinge the chirches perdicion. Which oure fore fathers as wise as we Were contente with humble simplicite To honour/obeynge their tuycion. Also none presumed till nowe a late Against the clergye to beare any hate Or grudged at their possession. Husbondman. By seynt mary syr/that is a starcke lye I can shewe you a worcke by and by Against that poynte makinge obiection. Which of warantyse I dare be bolde That it is aboue an hundred yere olde As the englishe selfe dothe testifye. Wherin the auctour with argumentes Speaketh a gainst the lordshippes &amp; rentes Of the clergye possessed wrongfully. Gentillman. Is it so olde as thou doest here expresse Reprouynge their pompous lordlynes So is it than no newe found heresy. Husbondman. No/ but alas/halfe the boke we want Hauynge no more left than a remenant From the begynnynge of the .vi. chapter verely. Gentillman. As for that it maketh no matter Begynne hardely at the sixte chapter Redynge forthe to the ende seriously. For though old writinges a pere to be rude Yet notwithstandinge they do include The pithe of a matter most fructuously. Husbondman. To rede it I shall be diligent Though the style be nothinge eloquent With ornate speache set out curiously. Here foloweth an olde treatyse made aboute the tyme of kynge Rycharde the seconde. The husbandman. Loo/nowe by this treatyse may ye well se That aforetymes against the spiritualte Men dyd invey/shewinge their vyces. Also here after this auctour dothe tell What great Ieoparde it is and perell For priestes to be in secular offices. Ye/and to lordes which against right Suffre them therein or therto excyte Prouynge it by their owne doctours &amp; lawes Gentillman. I beseche the rede forthe the processe That the people may se their vnhappenesse Which make all the world foles &amp; dawes. Husbandman. Syr howe lyke ye nowe this olde treatyse Yf so be noble men wold it aduertyse Puttynge a parte pryuate affeccion. Shuld they not perceyue here euydently That the clergye dothe theym great iniury Retaynynge thus temporall possessyon? Gentyllman. Nowe I promyse the after my iudgement I haue not hard of soche an olde fragment Better groundyd on reason with scripture. Yf soche auncy?t thynges myght come to lyght That noble men hadde ones of theym a syght The world yet wolde chaunge perauenture For here agaynst the clergye can not bercke Sayenge as they do/thys is a newe wercke Of heretykes contryued lately. And by thys treatyse it apperyth playne That before oure dayes men dyd compleyne Agaynst clerkes ambycyon so stately Husbandman. Concernynge thys treatyse and lyke matters I haue hard saye of my forefathers Howe in kynge henry the .v. raygne. What tyme as ye dyd specyfye The clergye persecutyd the gospell fercely Causynge moche chryst? people to be slayne The kynge at the last hauynge informacyon Thourough seryous consyderacyon Of soche proper matters as thys is. Beganne to note the clergyes tyranny And what temporaltees/they dyd occupye Their spirituall state ferre a mysse. Wherfore he determyned certeynly To depryue theym temporally Of all theyr worldly gouuernaunce. Whos pretence/as sone as they perceyued Amonge theym selfes they Imagyned To get the kynge ouer in to fraunce. That whyles he conqueryd ther his ryght In england do what they lyst they myght Theyr froward tyranny to fulfyll. Which counseil/thus brought to passe The kynge euer after so busyed wasse That he could not performe hys sayde wyll. Gentyllman. So moote I the/it was happye for the kynge That by soche a colour they could hym brynge From medlynge with that case any more. For hadde he it ones ernestly begonne They had put hym to a confusyon Euene as they dyd other kynges before. Husbandman. What suppose ye they wold haue done? Gentyllman. Mary/fyrst with a fayre interdyccion To coursse the lande as blacke as pytche. Than to inhybyt sayenge and syngynge Of mattyns/masse/and belles ryngynge With christen buryall of poore and ryche. Besyde that precheres euery where Shuld haue brought men in soche fere By theyr threatnynge exclamacyon. That their malycyous partye to take Subgettes shuld theyr prynce forsake Contrary to goddes ordynacyon. Euene as they dyd in hygh Germany To the Emperour lewes of Bauerye Whom Pope Ihone sought to confounde And so dyd the clergy as I vnderstande Vnto kynge Ihon here in Englande To kynge Steuen/&amp; henry the secounde. Husbandman. They saye kynge Ihone was poysoned Because an halfe peny lofe of breed He sayde/he wold make worthe .xij. pence. Gentillman. Tushe that is a cast of theyr comon gyse Soche infamy of prynces to deuyse To cloke theyr oune tyrannous vyolence. For hadde not kynge Ihon gone aboute From their temporaltees to put theym owt He hadde bene longe after a lyues man. But murder they neuer so shamefully They can geue it a cloke full craftely Sayenge/nobis non licet occidere quenqu?. Whan they brennyd the newe testament They pretendyd a zele very feruent To maynteyne onely goddes honour. Which they sayde with protestacyon Was obscured by translacyon In englysshe/causynge moche errour. But the trueth playnly to be sayde Thys was the cause why they were a frayde Least laye men shuld knowe theyr iniquite. Which through goddes worde is so vttred That it were not possyble to be suffred Yf to rede scripture men had lyberte. Also after the same maner a fasshyon Subtelly to colour theyr abhomynacyon They destroyed cronicles not longe a gone. Which for certeyne poyntes vnreuerently Soundynge a gaynst the kynges auncetrye As they saye/were brent euerychone. But for all that/they shulde haue been spared From burnynge: had they not so declared The clergyes abhomynable excesse. Husbandman. I suppose then/that they vse the same wayes In burnynge of heretykes nowe a dayes Whom they pursue with great furyousnes. Gentillman. No fayle/they perswade temporall menne Thes heretykes (as they saye) to brenne Least other good christians they shuld ?fecte But y? cause why they wolde haue theim rydde Is onely that theyr vnhappynes nowe hydde They dreede least they shuld openly detecte Husbandman. By my trouth it is nothinge vnlickly. For let one lyue neuer so wyckedly In abhominable scandalisacion. As longe as he will their church obaye Not refusynge his tithes duely to paye They shall make of him no accusacion. Howbeyt let him ones begynne to pynche Or withdrawe their tithinge an ynche For an heretike they will him aseite. Wherfore I wonder moche of the temporalte That in performynge the clargyes cruelte To burne soche parsones they haue delyte. Gentillman It is no merueil yf thou marcke well The clargye sayenge y? it is goddes quarrell Their mischeuous murdre to execute. Husbandman. So they are not a knowen by their wyll That it is their cause christen men to kyll But the faute vnto other they impute. Gentyllman. Touchinge that/another tyme at leyser I shall shewe the more of their maner But nowe I can not tary verely. Husbandman. Well syr/yf ye may no longer abyde Oure lorde be your continuall gyde Grauntinge y? trouth to be knowen openly. A comp?dious olde treatyse/shewynge/howe that we ought to haue the scripture in Englysshe. Thexcusacyon of y? treatyse Though I am olde/clothed ? barbarous wede Nothynge garnysshed with gaye eloquency Yet I tell the trouth/yf ye lyst to take hede Agaynst theyr frowarde/furious frenesy Which recken it for a great heresy And vnto laye people greuous outrage To haue goddes worde in their natyfe langage Enemyes I shall haue/many a shoren crowne With forked cappes and gaye croosys of golde Which to maynteyne ther ambicious renowne Are glad laye people in ignorance to holde Yet to shewe the verite/one maye be bolde All though it be a prouerbe daylye spoken Who that tellyth trouth/his head shalbe brok?. Unto the Reader Thys treatyse more than an .C. yere olde Declareth howe owre prelatis do ferre a mysse Which of frowarde presumpcion are so bolde To forbede the worde of god in englishe For as the prophete saieth blessed he is That exercyseth him selfe diligently Psal. i. In scripture night and daye continually.</field>
