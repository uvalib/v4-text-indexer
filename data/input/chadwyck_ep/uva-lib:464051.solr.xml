      <field name="fulltext">KING HORN From MS. Gg. 4. 27. 2. University Library, Cambridge. Alle beon he bliþe þat to my song lyþe: A sang ihc schal ?ou singe Of Murry þe kinge. King he was biweste So longe so hit laste. Godhild het his quen, Faire ne mi?te non ben. He hadde a sone þat het horn, Fairer ne miste non beo born. Ne no rein vpon birine, Ne sunne vpon bischine: Fairer nis non þane he was, He was bri?t so þe glas, He was whit so þe flur, Rose red was his colur. In none kinge riche Nas non his iliche. Twelf feren he hadde Þat he alle wiþ him ladde; Alle riche mannes sones &amp; alle hi were faire gomes, Wiþ him for to pleie, &amp; mest he luuede tweie; Þat on him het haþulf child, &amp; þat oþer ffikenild: Aþulf was þe beste &amp; fikenylde þe werste. Hit was vpon a someres day, Also ihc ?ou telle may, Murri þe gode king Rod on his pleing Bi þe se side, Ase he was woned ride: He fond bi þe stronde ariued on his londe Schipes fiftene wiþ sarazins kene. He axede what iso?te Oþer to londe bro?te. A payn hit ofherde &amp; hym wel sone answarede: ‘Þi lond folk we schulle slon And alle þat Crist luueþ vpon And þe selue ri?t anon, Ne schaltu todai henne gon.’ Þe kyng ali?te of his stede, For þo he hauede nede, &amp; his gode kni?tes two; Al to fewe he hadde þo. Swerd hi gunne gripe &amp; togadere smite; Hy smyten vnder schelde Þat sume hit yfelde. Þe king hadde al to fewe To?enes so vele schrewe; So fele mi?ten yþe Bringe hem þre to diþe. Þe pains come to londe &amp; neme hit in here honde: Þat folc hi gunne quelle &amp; churchen for to felle. Þer ne moste libbe Þe fremde ne þe sibbe, Bute hi here la?e asoke &amp; to here toke. Of alle wymmanne Wurst was godhild þanne; For Murri heo weop sore &amp; for horn ?ute more. He wenten vt of halle Fram hire Maidenes alle; Vnder a roche of stone, Þer heo liuede alone, Þer heo seruede gode A?enes þe paynes forbode; Þer he seruede criste Þat no payn hit ne wiste: Eure heo bad for horn child Þat Jesu crist him beo myld. Horn was in paynes honde Wiþ his feren of þe londe. Muchel was his fairhede, for ihesu crist him makede Payns him wolde slen Oþer al quic flen, ?ef his fairnesse nere, Þe children alle asla?e were. Þanne spak on Admirad, Of wordes he was bald, ‘Horn, þu art wel kene, &amp; þat is wel isene; Þu art gret &amp; strong, fair &amp; euene long; Þu schalt waxe more Bi fulle seue ?ere: ?ef þu mote to liue go &amp; þine feren also, ?ef hit so bi falle ?e scholde slen vs alle: Þaruore þu most to stere, Þu &amp; þine ifere; To schupe schulle ?e funde &amp; sinke to þe grunde, Þe se ?ou schal adrenche, Ne schal hit us no?t ofþinche; For if þu were aliue, Wiþ swerd oþer wiþ kniue, We scholden alle deie &amp; þi fader deþ abeie.’ Þe children hi bro?te to stronde Wringinde here honde In to schupes borde At þe furste worde. Ofte hadde horn beo wo At neure wurs þan him was þo. Þe se bigan to flowe &amp; horn child to rowe; Þe se þat schup so fasste drof Þe children dradde þerof. Hi wenden to wisse of here lif to misse, Al þe day &amp; al þe ni?t, Til hit sprang dai li?t Til Horn sa? on þe stronde Men gon in þe londe. ‘Feren’ quaþ he ‘?onge, Ihc telle ?ou tiþinge, Ihc here fo?eles singe &amp; þat gras him springe. Bliþe beo we on lyue, Vre schup is on ryue.’ Of schup hi gunne funde &amp; setten fout to grunde, Bi þe se side hi leten þat schup ride. Þanne spak him child horn, In suddene he was iborn, ‘Schup, bi þe se flode Daies haue þu gode: Bi þe se brinke No water þe nadrinke. ?ef þu cume to Suddenne, Gret þu wel of myne kenne, Gret þu wel my moder, Godhild quen þe gode; &amp; seie þe paene kyng, Jesucristes wiþering, Þat ihc am hol &amp; fer On þis lond ariued her; And seie þat hei schal fonde Þe dent of myne honde.’ Þe children ?ede to Tune Bi dales &amp; bi dune. Hy metten wiþ almair king, Crist ?euen him his blessing, King of Westernesse, Crist ?iue him Muchel blisse, He him spac to horn child Wordes þat were Mild: ‘Whannes beo ?e, faire gumes, Þat her to londe beoþ icume, Alle þrottene Of bodie swiþe kene? Bigod þat me makede, A swihc fair verade Ne sau? ihc in none stunde Bi westene londe: Seie me wat ?e seche.’ Horn spak here speche, He spak for hem alle, vor so hit moste biualle; He was þe faireste &amp; of wit þe beste. ‘We beoþ of Suddenne, Icome of gode kenne, Of Cristene blode &amp; kynges suþe gode. Payns þer gunne ariue &amp; duden hem of lyue: Hi slo?en &amp; todro?e Cristenemen ino?e. So crist me mote rede Vs he dude lede In to a galeie, wiþ þe se to pleie, Dai hit is igon &amp; oþer: Wiþute sail &amp; roþer Vre schip bigan to swymme To þis londes brymme. Nu þu mi?t vs slen &amp; binde, Ore honde bihynde, Bute ?ef hit beo þi wille, Helpe þat we ne spille.’ Þanne spak þe gode kyng, Iwis he nas no Niþing: ‘Seie me, child, what is þi name, Ne schaltu haue bute game.’ Þe child him answerde Sone so he hit herde: ‘Horn ihc am ihote, Icomen vt of þe bote Fram þe se side: Kyng, wel mote þe tide.’ Þanne hym spak þe gode kyng, ‘Wel bruc þu þin euening, Horn þu go wel schulle Bi dales &amp; bi hulle; Horn þu lude sune Bi dales &amp; bi dune, So schal þi name springe Fram kynge to kynge, &amp; þi fairnesse Abute Westernesse, Þe strengþe of þine honde In to Eurech londe: Horn, þu art so swete Ne may ihc þe forlete.’ Hom rod Aylmar þe kyng &amp; horn mid him his fundyng &amp; alle his ifere Þat were him so dere. Þe kyng com in to halle Among his kni?tes alle: Forþ he clupede aþelbrus, Þat was stiward of his hus: ‘Stiward, tak nu here Mi fundlyng for to lere Of þine mestere, of wude &amp; of riuere; &amp; tech him to harpe Wiþ his nayles scharpe, Biuore me to kerue &amp; of þe cupe serue; Þu tech him of alle þe liste Þat þu eure of wiste, In his feiren þou wise In to oþere seruise: Horn þu vnderuonge &amp; tech him of harpe &amp; songe.’ Ailbrus gan lere Horn &amp; his yfere: Horn in herte la?te Al þat he him ta?te. In þe curt &amp; vte &amp; elles al abute Luuede men horn child, &amp; mest him louede Rymenhild, Þe kynges o?ene doster, He was mest in þo?te: Heo louede so horn child Þat ne? heo gan wexe wild: For heo ne mi?te at borde Wiþ him speke no worde, Ne no?t in þe halle Among þe kni?tes alle, Ne nowhar in non oþere stede: Of folk heo hadde drede: Bi daie ne bi ni?te Wiþ him speke ne mi?te; Hire sore?e ne hire pine Ne mi?te neure fine: In heorte heo hadde wo, &amp; þus hire biþo?te þo, Heo sende hire sonde Aþelbrus to honde Þat he come hire to, &amp; also scholde horn do Al in to bure, ffor heo gan to lure; &amp; þe sonde seide Þat sik lai þat maide, &amp; bad him come swiþe, For heo nas noþing bliþe, Þe stuard was in herte wo, For he nuste what to do; Wat Rymenhild hure þo?te Gret wunder him þu?te, Abute horn þe ?onge To bure for to bringe; He þo?te vpon his mode Hit nas for none gode. He tok him anoþer, Athulf, hornes broþer. ‘Aþulf,’ he sede, ‘ri?t anon Þu schalt wiþ me to bure gon, To speke wiþ Rymenhild stille &amp; witen hure wille. In hornes ilike þu schalt hure biswike: Sore ihc me ofdrede He wolde horn misrede.’ Aþelbrus gan Aþulf lede &amp; in to bure wiþ him ?ede. Anon vpon Aþulf child Rymenhild gan wexe wild: He wende þat horn hit were þat heo hauede þere. Heo sette him on bedde; Wiþ Aþulf child he wedde. On hire armes tweie Aþulf heo gan leie. ‘Horn,’ quaþ heo, ‘wel longe Ihc habbe þe luued stronge. Þu schalt þi trewþe pli?te On myn hond her ri?te Me to spuse holde, &amp; ihc þe lord to wolde.’ Aþulf sede on hire ire So stille so hit were: ‘Þi tale nu þu lynne, For horn nis no?t her inne. Ne beo we no?t iliche: Horn is sairer &amp; riche, Fairer bi one ribbe Þane eni Man þat libbe: Þe? horn were vnder Molde Oþer elles wher he wolde Oþer henne a þusend Mile, Ihc nolde him ne þe bigile.’ Rymenhild hire biwente &amp; Aþelbrus fule heo schente. ‘Hennes þu go, þu fule þeof, Ne wurstu me neure more leof; Went vt of my bur Wiþ muchel mesauentur. Schame mote þu fonge &amp; on hi?e rode anhonge. Ne spek ihc no?t wiþ horn Nis he no?t so vnorn; Horn is fairer þane beo he: Wiþ muchel schame mote þu deie.’ Aþelbrus in a stunde Fel anon to grunde: ‘Lefdi Min o?e, Liþe me a litel þro?e. Lust whi ihc wonde Bringe þe horn to honde. For horn is fair &amp; riche, Nis no whar his iliche: Aylmar þe gode kyng Dude him on mi lokyng; ?ef horn were her abute, Sore y me dute Wiþ him ?e wolden pleie Bitwex ?ou selue tweie: Þanne scholde wiþuten oþe Þe kyng maken vs wroþe. Rymenhild, for?ef me þi tene, Lefdi, my quene, &amp; horn ihc schal þe fecche, Wham so hit recche.’ Rymenhild ?ef he cuþe Gan lynne wiþ hire Muþe: Heo makede hire wel bliþe; Wel was hire þat siþe: ‘Go nu,’ quaþ heo, ‘sone &amp; send him after none, Whane þe kyng arise, On a squieres wise, To wude for to pleie: Nis non þat him biwreie. He schal wiþ me bileue Til hit beo nir eue, To hauen of him mi wille, After ne recchecche what me telle.’ Aylbrus wende hire fro, Horn in halle fond he þo Bifore þe kyng on benche Wyn for to schenche. ‘Horn,’ quaþ he, ‘so hende, To bure nu þu wende After mete stille Wiþ Rymenhild to duelle: Wordes suþe bolde In herte þu hem holde: Horn, beo me wel trewe, Ne schal hit þe neure rewe.’ Horn in herte leide Al þat he him seide: He ?eode in wel ri?te To Rymenhild þe bri?te, On knes he him sette &amp; sweteliche hure grette. Of his feire si?te Al þe bur gan li?te. He spac faire speche, Ne dorte him noman teche: ‘Wel þu sitte &amp; softe, Rymenhild þe bri?te, Wiþ þine Maidenes sixe Þat þe sitteþ nixte. Kinges stuard vre Sende me in to bure Wiþ þe speke ihc scholde; Seie me what þu woldest, Seie &amp; ihc schal here What þi wille were.’ Rymenhild vp gan stonde &amp; tok him bi þe honde: Heo sette him on pelle Of wyn to drinke his fulle: Heo makede him faire chere &amp; tok him abute þe swere. Ofte heo him custe So wel so hire luste. ‘Horn,’ heo sede, ‘wiþute strif Þu schalt haue me to þi wif; Horn, haue of me rewþe &amp; plist me þi trewþe.’ Horn þo him biþo?te What he speke mi?te. ‘Crist,’ quaþ he, ‘þe wisse &amp; ?iue þe heuene blisse Of þine husebonde Wher he beo in londe. Ihc am ibore to lowe Such wimman to knowe. Ihc am icome of þralle &amp; fundling bifalle. Ne feolle hit þe of cunde To spuse beo me bunde: Hit nere no fair wedding Bitwexe a þral &amp; a king.’ Þo gan Rymenhild mis lyke &amp; sore gan to sike: Armes heo gan bu?e, Adun he feol iswo?e. Horn in herte was ful wo, &amp; tok hire on his armes two: He gan hire for to kesse Wel ofte mid ywisse. ‘Lemman,’ he sede, ‘dere, Þin herte nu þu stere. Help me to kni?te Bi al þine mi?te, To my lord þe king, Þat he me ?iue dubbing. Þanne is mi þralhod Iwent in to kni?thod, &amp; ischal wexe more &amp; do, lemman, þi lore.’ Rymenhild, þat swete þing Wakede of hire swo?ning: ‘Horn,’ quaþ heo, ‘vel sone Þat schal beon idone: Þu schalt beo dubbed kni?t Are come seue ni?t. Haue her þis cuppe &amp; þis Ryng þer vppe To Aylbrus &amp; stuard, &amp; se he holde foreward: Seie ihc him biseche Wiþ loueliche speche Þat he adun falle Bifore þe king in halle, &amp; bidde þe king ari?te Dubbe þe to kni?te. Wiþ seluer &amp; wiþ golde Hit wurþ him wel i?olde. Crist him lene spede Þin erende to bede.’ Horn tok his leue, For hit was ne? eue. Aþelbrus he so?te &amp; ?af him þat he bro?te, &amp; tolde him ful ?are Hu he hadde ifare, &amp; sede him his nede, &amp; bihet him his mede. Aþelbrus also swiþe Wente to halle bliue: ‘Kyng,’ he sede, ‘þu leste A tale mid þe beste; Þu schalt bere crune Tomore?e in þis tune; Tomore?e is þi feste: Þer bihoueþ geste. Hit nere no?t for loren For to kni?ti child horn, Þine armes for to welde, God kni?t he schal ?elde.’ Þe king sede sone, ‘Þat is wel idone. Horn me wel iquemeþ, God kni?t him bisemeþ. He schal haue mi dubbing &amp; afterward mi derling. &amp; alle his feren twelf He schal kni?ten him self: Alle he schal hem kni?te Bifore me þis ni?te.’ Til þe li?t of day sprang Ailmar him þu?te lang.

And sire Aþulf, þi broþer, He schal haue anoþer. Horn, ihc þe biseche, Wiþ loueliche speche, Crist ?eue god erndinge Þe a?en to bringe.’ Þe kni?t hire gan kesse, &amp; heo him to blesse: Leue at hire he nam, &amp; in to halle cam.

Hour king haþ boden him gold &amp; fe, Wiþ þat he wil wiþ him be At þis ich nede, &amp; Horn ful trewely haþ him hi?t For to stond in stede of kni?t, In herd is nou?t to hide.’ In yrlond was þer nan, Þat alle þai be to malkan gan, So michel was his pouste; Bot finlak king him al an Has þe batayl vnder tan, ?if crist wil þat it be. King malkan dede bede out here, Opon þe king finlak to were; ‘Now þan schal we se, ?if he wil fi?t, he schal be slan, ?if he wil bide, he schal be tan: Y trowe best he wil fle.’ Bot þre woukes were þer sett, Þat alle þis folk schal be mett, &amp; batayle schal þer be. Þe Walis king hadde gret lett Wiþ windes &amp; wiþ watres bett, Sir elidan þe fre; He no mi?t in to irlond come, For to helpen his sone, For stormes on þe se. King finlak seyd, ‘is nou?t to hide, Þis batayl dar y nou?t abide; Mi rede is tan to fle.’ &amp; þan was Horn as fain o fi?t, As is þe foule of þe li?t, When it ginneþ dawe: ‘Sir king, forto held þi ri?t, Y rede þou bede riche ?ift: Þe folk wil to þe drawe; Geder to þe folk þat þou may, &amp; baldliche hold þi day, Batail schal we schawe: To fle me þink it is gret schame, Ar dintes be smiten or ani man slan, For drede of wordes awe.’ Þe kinges sones wer kni?tes bold, &amp; seyd þai wald þe batail hold, Her liues forto lete; Finlac king, þei he war ald, Bleþeli he seyd fi?t he wald, To hold þat he bi-hete. Þus þai riden out of toun Wiþ spere oloft &amp; goinfaynoun, Malkan king to mete; Wiþ speres scharp &amp; swerdes gode Þai slou? mani afrely fode, So grimli gun þai grete. Þer Horn sei?e þe mest þrang, In he rides hem a-mang &amp; lays on wel gode won; It was no man of yrland, Mi?t stond adint of his hand, At ich stroke he slou? on Maiden &amp; wiif gret sorwe gan make For þe kinges sones sake, Þat were apoint to dye. Finlac king o?aines him come, &amp; his armes of him nome; Þe blod ran ouer his ei?e. He cleped his douhter Acula, &amp; bad sche schuld a plaster ta; Of woundes was sche slei?e. Þe maiden tast Hornes wounde, Þe kinges douhter, in þat stounde; Of him hye is ful fain: ‘Þou schalt be sone hole &amp; sounde; Hastow Malkan brou?t to grounde?’ He seyd, ‘?a,’ o?ain. ‘King Malkan was mi faders ban, &amp; now for soþe ich haue him slan, Þe soþe for to sain.

Finlac king him bi þou?t, Hou he Horn ?eld mou?t, To ?if him his warisoun; He tok malkan kinges lond, &amp; sesed it in to Hornnes hond, Boþe tour &amp; toun. Erles, barouns, euerichon, In Irlond was þer non, Þat no com to his somoun. Þe kinges douhter Acula Loued hende Horn so Sche durst it nou?t kiþe; Wheþer sche sei?e him ride or go, Hir þou?t hir hert brak atvo, Þat sche no spac wiþ þat bliþe. On aday sche made hir seke, Horn com &amp; wiþ hir speke, Sche mi?t no lenger miþe; To him spac þat maiden fre &amp; seyd, ‘horn, y loue þe, Man most oliue.’ Ouer al horn þe priis him wan, He seyd it was for owiman, Þat was him leue &amp; dere: Acula wende for þan, Þat horn hir loued &amp; most gode an Of ani woman þat were. Of anoþer was al his þou?t, Maiden Rimnild for?at he nou?t, Sche lay his hert ful nere. Þe ring to schewen haþ he tan, Þe hewe was chaunged of þe stan, For gon is seuen ?ere. Horn wald no lenger abide; He busked him for to ride &amp; gedred folk eueraware, An hundred kni?tes bi his side, Wiþ stedes fele &amp; michel pride, Her schippes were ful ?are. Þai sayled ouer þe flode so gray, In Inglond ariued were þay, Þer hem leuest ware; Vnder awode þer þai gan lende, Horn sei?e abegger wende, &amp; after he is fare. Horn fast after him gan ride &amp; bad þe begger schuld abide, For to here his speche. Þe begger answerd in þat tide, ‘Vilaine, canestow nou?t ride? Fairer þou mi?t me grete; Haddestow cleped me gode man, Y wold haue teld þe wennes y cam &amp; whom y go to seche: Horn to seke haue y gon Þurch out londes mani on, &amp; ay schal while we mete. &amp; now be min robes riuen, &amp; me no was no noþer ?euen Of alle þis seuen ?ere.

To day is moging þe king Wiþ rimnild at spouseing, Þe kinges douhter dere; Mani sides schuld be bi bled, Er he bring hir to his bed, ?if horn in lond were. Wiard schaltow calle me; Gentil man, ?if þou be fre, Tel me þi name; Þi knaue wald y fain be, Þat fair fest forto se, Me þenke þatow hast nane.’ Horn answerd him o?ain, ‘Ich hat Horn, is nou?t to lain, &amp; elles were me schame; Bot ?if ich held þat þou hast seyd, Er þat þai ben in bed layd, Fiue þousende schal be slain. Wiard, o?ain schaltow ride To mi folk &amp; þere abide, Haue here mi robe to mede; &amp; y wil to court gon, Forto loke what þai don, In þi pouer wede; Bring hem vnder ?on wode side, Al so ?ern astow may ride, Þe way þou canst hem lede; &amp; y schal hei?e me wel sone, Y com o?ain, er it be none, ?if crist me wil spede.’ When horn fro fer herd glewe, Wiþ tabournes bete &amp; trumppes blewe, O?aines hem he ?ede.

Wiþ þi þou lat mi bridel be, What so þou wilt aski me, Bleþelich ?iue y þe.’ ‘Peter!’ quaþ Horn, ‘þatow wilt ?iue me maiden Rimnild, Þat is so fair &amp; fre.’ Þe king was wroþ &amp; rewe his ?ift: ‘Þou askest wrong &amp; no þing ri?t, Sche may nou?t þine be.’ Horn seyd, ‘Y sett a nett otime: ?if ani fische is taken þer inne Of al þis seuen ?ere, No schal it neuer more be mine, Y wold it were sonken in helle pine, Wiþ fendes fele on fere; &amp; ?if it haþ ytaken nou?t, Y schal it loue in hertþou?t, &amp; be me leue &amp; dere.’ Þus þai went alle ysame Vnto þe castel wiþ gle &amp; game; A fole þai wende he were. ‘Of beggers mo þan sexti,’ Horn seyd, ‘maister am y, &amp; aske þe þe mete, Þat y mote &amp; oþer þre To day in þine halle be, When folk is gon to sete; Þan y wil folwe þe ham, &amp; þat y mot wiþ þe gan In atte castel ?ete.’ Þe king him hi?t sikerly: ‘Þou schalt in þe halle by To haue þere þi mete.’ Þer was mani riche gest Di?t vnto þat frely fest Of douhti folk in lond; Atte ?ate was strong þrast, Horn wald nou?t be þe last In for to gange. Þe porter cald him herlot swain, &amp; he put him o?ain, Þer out for to stand. Horn brust opon him so, His scholder bon he brak ato, &amp; in anon he þrange. Kokes hadde þe mete grayd, Þe bord was sett, þe cloþ was layd; To benche ?ede þe bold; Þe trompes blewe, þeglewemenpleyd, Þe bischopes had þe grace y seyd, As miri men of molde.

Þan was þe lawe, soþe to say, Þe bride schuld þe first day Seruen atte mete; Hendelich þan serued scho, As a maiden schuld do; Horn bigan to speke: ‘Maiden, ?if þi wille be, To godes men schultow se, Þou no ou?test hem nou?t for?ete; &amp; seþþen þe kni?tes schul turnay, For to loke who so may Þe maistri of hem ?ete.’ Forþ sche went, þat maiden fre, &amp; feched drink, þat men mi?t se, To þat beggere: ‘For hornnes loue y pray þe, Go nou?t, ar þis drunken be, ?if euer he was þe dere.’ Þe maiden bi him stille stode, To here of horn hir þou?t it gode, He lay hir hert ful nere; Of þe coppe he drank þe wine, Þe ring of gold he kest þer inne: ‘Bi tokening, lo, it here!’ ‘A, sely man, þe þrestes sare, Þou schalt haue a drink mare, Gode wine schal it be.’ Anoþer drank sche him bare, Sche asked ?if horn þer in ware; ‘?a, certes,’ þan seyd he. Nas sche bot alitel fram him gon, Þat sche ne fel adoun anon, Now swoneþ þat fre. Kni?tes her to chaumber ledde; When sche lay opon hir bedde, Sche seyd, ‘clepe haþerof to me.’ ‘Kni?tes, goþ in to halle swiþe, &amp; bid þe kinges make hem bliþe, Þat y wold wel fain; Haþerof, go in to þe erber swiþe &amp; geder paruink &amp; iue, Greses þat ben of main.

Forþ þai ?ede, þo kni?tes bold; Haþerof þe maidens erand told, Of trewe loue Horn was wiis: ‘Y schal com in to þe feld wiþ pride, An hundred kni?tes bi mi side, Milke white is mi queintise.’ ‘Bot, haþerof, þou most me schawe, Whar bi y schal Wikard knawe, His buffeyt schal be bou?t.’ ‘He haþ queintise white so snawe, Wiþ foules blac as ani crawe, Wiþ silke werk it is wrou?t. Moioun queintise is ?alu &amp; wan, Sett wiþ pekok &amp; wiþ swan, Þat he wiþ him haþ brou?t; Wikeles queintise is ?alu &amp; grene, Floure de liis sett bi tvene, Him for ?ete þou nou?t.’ Now if haþerof comen o?ain, &amp; seyd he haþ Horn sain, &amp; what folk he haþ brou?t; &amp; after wisarmes he gan frain; Was neuer Rimnild ere so fain In hert no in þou?t: ‘Haþerof, go in to halle swiþe &amp; bid mi fader make him bliþe &amp; say icham sike nou?t.
