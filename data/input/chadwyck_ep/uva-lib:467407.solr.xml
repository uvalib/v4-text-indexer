Afore the woodwele, owre the brere, Shall lanely toot, âSic' bodies were,â Foreslow they daft unmaklye loons, Wha're fettled weel to chow their spoons: Owre fat for wark, too lang they steal Fra' sair-toil'd folk their claes and meal. Old Ballad. YOUNG POETS' PLAINT. 1 God, release our dying sister! Beauteous blight hath sadly kiss'd her: Whiter than the wild, white roses, Famine in her face discloses Mute submission, patience holy, Passing fair! but passing slowly. 2 Though she said, âYou know I'm dying,â In her heart green trees are sighing; Not of them hath pain bereft her, In the city, where we left her: âBring,â she said, âa hedgeside blossom!â Love shall lay it on her bosom. THE POOR MAN'S DAY. Grahame. 1 Sabbath holy! To the lowly Still art thou a welcome day. When thou comest, earth and ocean, Shade and brightness, rest and motion, Help the poor man's heart to pray. 2 Sun-wak'd forest! Bird, that soarest O'er the mute, empurpled moor! Throstle's song, that stream-like flowest! Wind, that over dewdrop goest! Welcome now the woe-worn poor. 3 Little river, Young for ever! Cloud, gold-bright with thankful glee! Happy woodbine, gladly weeping! Gnat, within the wild rose keeping! Oh, that they were bless'd as ye! 4 Sabbath holy! For the lowly Paint with flowers thy glittering sod; For affliction's sons and daughters, Bid thy mountains, woods, and waters, Pray to God, the poor man's God! 5 From the fever, (Idle never Where on Hope Want bars the door,) From the gloom of airless alleys, Lead thou to green hills and valleys Weary Lordland's trampled poor! 6 Pale young mother! Gasping brother! Sister, toiling in despair! Grief-bow'd sire, that life-long diest! White-lipp'd child, that sleeping sighest! Come, and drink the light and air. 7 Still God liveth; Still he giveth What no law can take away; And, oh, Sabbath! bringing gladness Unto hearts of weary sadness, Still art thou âThe Poor Man's Day!â CHORUS. 1 These pauper-kings, these tax-fed things, What say these murderous robber-kings? To man with labour bow'd, âReceive thy parish shroud!â To woman, âSeek the homeless street, Or prayerless grave, where four roads meet!â To enterprise, âBe bold in vain!â To failing strength, âStill toil for pain!â To youth, âThou shalt not hope!â to age, âThou shalt not rest!â To care-worn skill, âThou shalt not thrive!â to genius, âDie, unbless'd!â 2 Cain! Cain! the murder'd and the just Speak to their brother from the dust: âCain!â saith scath'd Hope, ârestore The smile that once I wore.â âReplant,â saith Love, âmy rose replant!â âReclothe my bones!â saith buried want; Thy convicts cry, âRecal our youth! Oh, bring us back its trust in truth!â And all cry, âUncreate the pangs thou yet may'st share, In millions of yet living hearts, law-wedded to despair!â DIRGE. 1 God said to man, âArise, and toil, To fill thy soul with good:â But men said, âNo! nor food, nor work:â I toil'd, and wanted food. 2 All ills that man can bear I bore, With none to see me nigh; For pain I toil'd, of want I died; God only saw me die! 3 âBread, bread for toil!â I ask'd of man, But death for toil he gave: And now I ask âA little earth! For famish'd man a grave!â 4 Of God I ask, what God will give, âRest! till the end shall be:â Safe in his hands, oh, sweet is rest To woe-worn men like me! HYMN. [To live in vain! to live in pain!] 1 To live in vain! to live in pain! To toil in hopeless sadness! Is this the doom of godlike man, Oh, God of Love and Gladness? Not so the rose in summer blows, Not so the moon her changes knows, Not so the storm his madness. 2 From storms that rock the oak to sleep, Thy woods their beauty borrow; And flowers, to-day, unheeded weep, Whose seeds will live to-morrow: So man, by painful ages taught, Will build, at last, on truthful thought, And wisdom, won from sorrow. 3 Else, what a lie were written wide, By thy right hand, my Father, O'er all thy seas, in crimson dyed When Morning is a bather; O'er all thy vales of growing gold; Or where, on mountains black with cold, Thy clouds to battle gather. YOUNG POET. Round the rascal-beggar's bed, Who all mortal troubles bore, Whom the wicked vex no more,â Let us pray. Where the hasty prayer was said, And poor mortals equal are, Mocking marble mockeries! there Let us pray. Thereâwhere lowly lie the dead! Lest we, too, be as the clay, Unto God, for bread to-day, Let us pray. MISCELLANIES. [If hard and tough grow butchers' bums] QUEER BOBBY IN 1837. BUT NOT THE BOBBY OF 1846. âNews! news!â âWhat news?â âThe skin of a butcher's a?e Would sole a pair of shoes.â Old Ballad. 1 If hard and tough grow butchers' bums, Because they often ride; If thick with cant, as both my thumbs, Is meek Saint Agnew's hide; If consciences grow thick and foul With quibbles that men use; The skin of sweet Sir Robert's soul Would sole a pair of shoes. 2 If greedy men, with eating ducks, Web-footed ne'er have grown, The landed leech, our blood that sucks, Wont bring us beef from stone; But if backsides, once soft as down, Have tough as teak become, Sir Robert, bobbing up and down, Is like a butcher's bum. 3 And if his soul's thin skin grows tough With bobbing up and down; And nought but leather's tough enough To save a leagur'd town; What need we do, our foes to ban, Our country's wounds to heal, But get some practis'd hand to tan The well-bobb'd soul of Peel? 4 And since the man won't think it sin To save a soul from hellâ But which his soul, and which his skin, May find it hard to tellâ What need we do, I fain would learn, If such a case befal, But lime and soak the whole concern, And tan him, soul and all? 5 But where a tanner shall we get, Not squeamish in his wame? For Brougham no longer tans such ket; My lords, it were a shame! Unless our Queen would musk the scum Of bobbers, as is fit, And send him, nick-nam'd âBaron Bum,â Up to the civet-pit. What a knitter of stockings is in a family, since the invention of the stocking-loom, Peel is in Parliament. The improved machinery of the human mind has, to this hour, wrought no beneficial effect upon him. He is still a knitter, painfully taking up spinster's stitches, worth, in a pair of stockings, fourpence! Place him in his natural position, take the pins from his fingers, force into his hand a book containing the alphabet of political science, and before the close of another year, he will cease to be overtopped in mental stature by any mechanic's apprentice. He is not a goose, and if he were, plucking one does not enable it to fly better; why, then, does he pluck himself? He is blinded by the glare of the cruel sunshine which fortune has cast upon him. Strip him of his artificial advantages, and you give him an eagle's wing. Sprung from the people, why does he not lead public opinion? The reek of the aristocratic dunghill covers him, like a nightmare, forcing on him a dream of vulgarity hostile to his noble nature. Why should such a man wish to be a Stanley? By no possible process can the healthy verjuice of humanity be turned into aromatic vinegar, acceptable in Puppydom. Upperthorpe, 3rd Feb., 1837. THE IMITATED LANE. Now, Landscape-Maker, that with living trees Createst Painting! thou should'st hither come, And here learn how the town-sick heart to please. Can'st thou not, in thy tiny wild, find room For a wild lane, that with capricious ease Shading or brightening self-taught branch or flower, Will saunter gently to a seated bower? Or lead thee through a cloudlet of green gloom, Cheer'd by the music of its hidden rills, To sudden sunburst? where the hunter's cot Looks down on rivers, and the distant hills Climb to the firmament, yet marry not Their purple to the orange-blaze, that fills O'er-arching heav'n with pomp, And peace, and power! ODE ON THE MARRIAGE OF VICTORIA THE FIRST. 1 Queen of our Hearts! true marriage Is made of solid bread; Not so, that Many-Childed Plague Which curseth board and bed: The ghastly league of woe with crime, To which starv'd men are driv'n, Though marriage call'd by law-made saints, Hath other names in heav'n. 2 Lady! may all the blessings Which thou would'st give to all Who call thee queen, or God their lord, On thee, thrice blessed, fall! If 'tis thy wish that every pair Should live in love for ever, May God return thee good for good, And love desert thee never! 3 But want and crime, Victoria, Law-wedded in this land, Are curses, million-multiplied, That frown on every hand; And thou wilt wake, with him thou lov'st, From brief and troubled slumbers, If law of thine deal lessening loaves To famine's doubling numbers. 4 Where'er they are, thy kinglings Sow baseness, cant, and pride; The name of their feudality By wretched men is sigh'd: Deep hatred of their race accurs'd Gaunt orphan-victims cherish; At home, abroad, the millions groan, The hopeless millions perish. 5 Then, be a Man, Victoria, If thou would'st reign, a Queen! Wise must thou be, and brave, and all That honour's best have been, If thou would'st tame the Feudal Beast, Whose hydra-headed howling Appals the devils whom he serves, And Ruin, o'er him scowling. 6 Remember Austria's daughter! And lest thy true heart fail, Ask what were they for whom she died, When banded kings turn'd pale? Around her, throne and altar fell, In thousand fragments shiver'd, Because she hearken'd unto men Who would not be deliver'd! 7 Beautiful as the cistus, That o'er the stonechat's nest Stoops, when the moorland clouds lie down On evening's lap to rest, Art thou, my Queen! the morning dews Upon the orchard blossom, Are not more pure than is the heart Within thy royal bosom. 8 But can the Queen be happy, If millions round her weep? In love's elysium, while hope faints, Can Hope's Victoria sleep? No. Bringer of Redemption! thou, In love's elysium sleeping, Would'st wake, to grieve with starving men, And worth in dungeons weeping. 9 The woodbine's cluster'd beauty, That hides the brooding thrush, And weds the wild hedgerose, when Morn Shakes pearls from tree and bush, All trembling like the skylark's wing, Would dread his voice of gladness, And hate the marriages of Spring, If dower'd with hate and sadness. 10 Behold that silent captive, Apprentic'd to the tomb! His heart-worn features glimmering through The dull damp prison-gloom! Roden? or Bradshaw? is he call'd; Shaw? Oastler? Greg? O'Connor? No. What his crime? Say, hath he sold His memory to dishonour? 11 Hath he traduc'd a nation, Because three hundred years Have seen her trampled people drink Subjection's poison'd tears? All other shame hath he eclips'd, Barbarian, Greek, and Roman, Blaspheming all bless'd names in one, The sacred name of woman? 12 Hath he betray'd the people Unto the people's foes? Mean triumphs given to paltriest men, Whose gods are bonds and blows? Deceived the poor, the everwrong'd? And factious, noisy, froward, Urg'd them to unpartaken deathâ A cruel, skulking coward? 13 No. He whose spirit dieth Beneath that dungeon's pall, Proclaim'd that all men equal are, For God is sire of all! Oh, Lady, if thy heart were stone, His tale of tears would move it! The man thou see'st is guileless, brave; Kind, childlike William Lovett. 14 And names of crimeless sorrow Are whisper'd, aye, and heard, When wide-wing'd Trouble hovers o'er Doom'd empires, like a bird; Till wildly old subverted states, While tears of blood are gushing, Create the Force that crusheth Powerâ Like upturn'd ocean's rushing. 15 At voluntary tumult Misrule may safely frown: Not mobs that will, but mobs that must, Bring thron'd Oppression down! And wise are they who timely hear The gentle voice, which pleadeth That self-endanger'd Pomp would grant The safeguards it most needeth. THE SUN'S BIRD. 1 The cloud of the rain is beneath thee. Thou singest, Palac'd in glory; but Morn hath begun A dark day for man, while the sunbeams thou wingest, Bird of the Sun! Bird of the Sun! 2 They hear thee, but see thee notâsleepy bees hear thee, While under sad boughs the sad rivulets run; But thou art all music! care cannot get near thee, Bird of the Sun! Bird of the Sun! 3 And when from Light's fields thou descendest, and over Thy nest the wide gloom spreads its canopy dun, How sweet will thy sleep be among the sweet clover, Bird of the Sun! Bird of the Sun! 4 And, there, a white network of dewdrops the fairies, To chain leaf and flower, in a frolic have spun; While nigh thy dear home the tipp'd ear of the hare is, Bird of the Sun! Bird of the Sun! TOM AND JOHN. 1 While eager faces at his door Still bid the cripple welcome home; How bless'd is Tom, though blind and poor, And forc'd, in age, to beg and roam! But John, though young, is curs'd with cares Which biggen as his years encrease; And home prepares for his grey hairs The forest's gloom, without its peace! 2 While wranglers curse John's race and name, His father's grave, his sister's plea; To soothe Tom's heart, kind words proclaim The gentle looks he cannot see; And still his dog will lead the blind, To hear his tale, his daughter bend; Nor shall her father live, to find That faithful dog his only friend. 3 On John his liveried menials wait, As pompous plumes wave o'er the dead; He dines in state, and oft on plate, But still with aching heart and head: Tom smiles and pines, yet sometimes dines Where angels have their house of call, And God his feast for fowl and beast Spreads, in their common banquet-hall. 4 But John's full board no feast affords; He turns his much to more, in vain; For household-fiends their cruel words Still sharpen on his heart and brain: Deep in his shuddering soul they plant White-blossom'd sorrow's root unbless'd; While, envying blindness, age, and want, He woos the worm, and longs for rest. This poem is founded on some incidents in the life of a late breadtaxing palaced-pauper, who unable to give vast estates to each of his many sons, (and though succeeding pretty well, yet not so well as they wished, in quartering them on the public purse,) was constantly hectored by them, and told that he had better have sent them to plough; as if they could not have tried ploughing, without leave asked of him, and with a clear saving of all the bluster! SCOTSMEN TO SCOTLAND, WRITTEN FOR THE SCOTSMEN OF SHEFFIELD. Thy Men of Men shall we forget, Old Scotland? No. Where'er we be, All lonely, or in exile met, We think of them and thee. Mother of Knox! âhast thou a charmâ That gives to all thy name who bear Thoughts which unnerve the despot's arm, And Will, to do and dare? Thou bad'st him build on tyrant's bones An altar to the Lord of Lords; Thou gav'st him power to shatter thrones, And vanquish kings, with words. Stern Mother of the deathless dead! Where stands a Scot, a freeman stands, Self-stay'd, if poorâself-cloth'd, self-fed, Mind-mighty, in all lands. No mitred pleader need thy sons, To save the wretch whom Mercy spurns; No classic lore thy little ones, Who find a Bard in Burns. Their path, though dark, they will not miss; Secure, they tread on danger's brink; They say, âThis shall be!â and it is; For, ere they act, they think. Mother of Burns! thy woe-nurs'd bard Not always wisely thought or said; He err'd, he sinn'dâbut, oh, 'tis hard To ban the voiceless dead! Mother! thy doric speech hath power The heart with passions thrill to move; But none could sing, in hall or bower, Like him, thy Bard of Love. Who dipp'd his words in lightning? Who With thunder arm'd his stormy rhyme? Who made his music tender, true, Terse, terrible, sublime? Who bade thy bard, in thrall, maintain A freeman's port, where'er he trod? Who taught the peasant to disdain Proud Fashion's Minstrels? God. Who gave the child of toil a lyre, With living sunbeams wildly strung? And taught his soul of living fire Truth's universal tongue? God. See Coleridge's Hymn to Sunrise. But with torture Faction fill'd The cup he drain'd in gloomy pride: What marvel, if the poison kill'd? What marvel, if he died? Few were his days, his fortunes foul; Bravely he struggled, though not long; And with a poet's glowing soul, Drew near to God in song. For Conscience to thy poet said, âBurns! be a martyr!â âFor the truth, I will,â he criedâand bow'd his head, And died, grey-hair'd in youth. With little men he might not stay, But hasted from a world unkind: Oh, guess the worth he threw away, By what he left behind! And what a wreath his fame had worn, Amid a world's immortal tears, Had he, like England's Milton, borne The fruit of sixty years! But shall it of our sires be told That they their âbrother poorâ forsook? No! for they gave him more than gold; They bought the brave man's Book! Scotland! thy sonsâand not unearn'd This day of pleasing tears returnsâ Are met to mourn thy trampled, spurn'd, Poor, broken-hearted Burns. And oft' again, the kind, the brave, Who sorrow's feast, like him, have shar'd, Will meet, to honour in his grave Thy glorious rustic bard. Oh, spare his frailties!âwrite them not On mute Misfortune's coffin-lid!â Ev'n Bacon err'd, and greater Scott Not always greatly did. A fearful gift is flame from heav'n, To him who bears it in his breast: Self-fir'd, and blasted, but forgiv'n, Let Robert's ashes rest. HYMN. [Men! ye, who sow the earth with good!] 1 Men! ye, who sow the earth with good! Men! ye who earn the price of food; Strong Toil, and mightier Skill! God's Chosen! do his will; Save from himself man's deadliest foe, Ere Ruin mock his overthrow, His life of wrong, his death of shame, His shroud and grave of blood and flame! Haste! cry aloud to all, âBy good for good men live! Build not on broken hearts! nor take unless ye give!â 2 Shall savage drones, in baseness blind, Breathe plagues, beneath the light of mind? And curse the foodful soil, To famish Skill and Toil? Are the philosophers of the Gun and Standard, who pray for the destruction of trade, aware that six adults are sufficient for the cultivation of one hundred arable acres, and that, if the profits of trade failed to furnish other consumers with an equivalent for the produce, the only cultivated portion of every cultivable hundred acres in Britain would be that alone which is required for the maintenance of six adults and their families? It is of little importance to us what becomes of Messrs. Gun and Standard, but it might be well for them to take into their sapient consideration the possibility, in such a case, of the surplus of victims taking possession of the land, and the certainty that, without capital, they could not cultivate it. What, then, would happen, oh, sages of the Gun and Standard? Before the inventions of Watt and Arkwright, the people depended on the land for subsistence; they have since depended on the profits of those inventions, the landlords pocketing the surplus profits both of trade and agriculture. Destroy the profits of trade, and the landlords, with two-thirds of the people, must perish, unless the displaced population, seizing the land, can also appropriate capital previously amassed. But perhaps Messrs. Gun and Standard have really nothing to lose? Where grows the vine, the thistle dies; From cultur'd man the savage flies; Then, peasant, merchant, artisan, Transform the biped-brute to man! Bid truth, bid knowledge turn his mindless night to day! Bid love and mercy drive the human wolf away! 3 Men! not allow'd to earn your bread; Men! feeding all, yourselves half-fed; Why ask for work in vain? Or toil for death and pain? Shall brutal things, in human form, Feed on your souls like rat and worm? Say to your wives, âYe shall not eat?â Bid son with sire for graves compete? My late fellow-townsmen, having discovered that it is the unemployed workman who brings wages down, will, I trust, soon experience that where free trade is an unemployed workman is a prodigy. And mothers kill their babes, in flight from law and life, Till lawless law become th' assassin's match and knife? 4 Tool-Making Man! whose foodful mind I say not that man's hand is his mind; but, had he not possessed that thumbed implement, I doubt whether his mind, with his powers of communicating and accumulating ideas, could have raised him to his present intellectual eminence. Given a jack-plane, he might have stuck it in his mouth, and worked with it; but what sort of a jack-plane could he have made with his teeth? To his hand principally he is indebted for his success in tool making; and it is as a toolmaker, or manufacturer of such things as spades, ploughs, steam-engines, and railroads, that he has wrought all his wonders. One of our most reverend doctors calls the population of such towns as Sheffield extrinsic; not seeming to know that till there was a manufacturer there could be no agriculture, unless finger-grubbing for pignuts deserve that name. The first toolmaker was the first gardener; he put an end to finger-grubbing for pignuts, and called agriculture into existence. He, and subsequent toolmakers, may truly be said to have created every ounce of food which industrial skill has since produced. If any population deserves to be called intrinsic, it is that which can enable a hundred acres of land, cultivated commercially, to maintain more people than any ten thousand acres, cultivated agriculturally, ever yet did. About eight hundred acres of land at Leeds, cultivated commercially, maintain a hundred and forty thousand persons;âwhere shall we find a hundred thousand acres, cultivated agriculturally, maintaining an equal number? Had there never been a manufacturer, a few hordes of savages, fighting with the bears for roots, would now have constituted the words intrinsic population. With harvest freights the wave and wind, And thoughtfully creates The bread and life of states! Say to the fed on tears and blood, âProduction is the root of good!â And starve ye them who all produce, Ye costliest things of smallest use? Live ye in barren pomp, worst, bloodiest sons of Cain! To shake your fists at God, and turn his good to bane? 5 The child, that vainly toils, to aid Parents, death-doom'd by fetter'd trade; The sire, whose hopeless son Lives, but to be undone; The townsman, paid with less and less; The homeless thrall of hopelessness; The peasant, spurn'd, starv'd, hunted, jail'd, Because his law-made doom prevail'd; Still shall they feed with pangs the Moloch of the land, That Rapine o'er crush'd hearts may drive his four-in-hand? 6 Barbarians, no! in vain ye strive To keep a world's despair alive: Your baseness is our might, Your smitten darkness light: Mend! ere your crimes set bondage free: Christ said, Let children come to me! And shall ye curse the marriage-bed? No! men shall wed, and babes be fed: Our daughters shall not bring forth slaves; Nor childless sons seek workhouse graves! Nor idlers say to Toil, âThou shalt not love and live!â Nor blind brutes say to Skill, âWe take, and thou shalt give!â December, 1844. ENGLAND IN 1844. 1 Rascaldom, Parsondom, Lazy big Beggardom, Playing the fool! Helping with less and less Fast-growing wretchedness! Catch'd Cayley creakingly, âYoung Englandâ sneakingly Shearing calves' wool! 2 Breadtaxers stealing rates; John thinking Church-and-state's Hell is broke loose! Brassface and Timberface Half-fac'd by Doubleface! Foul things, with mouths and legs, Brawling o'er broken eggs! Killing the goose! 3 Four thousand poachers caught; The cream of this dismal jest is that the aristocracy are incurring the odium of the gamelaws, chiefly for the benefit of their imitators! The Puppydom of a town or district establishes a shooting-club; that of another a fishing-club; and in both prosecution is persecutionâ to the glory of the squires! It sometimes happens that a Hunt is got up in a manufacturing village; and this is as it should be. The magistracy, called upon to make good the broken fences of the farmer, are not a little betwittered. And if the hedgegapper happens to beânot a red or green-back, belonging to his whipper-inâbut some filth of a filesmith, or glueboiler, or other âlow varment,â Tomkins blusters tremendously! Rascalry's statute-taught Doctors of laws! Richmondites next to be? Teaching philosophy! Cunning, sans intellect, Sworn to deny th' effect, Aiding the cause. 4 Rusbrooke and Sotheron, Kept loobies, duller none, Not telling lies! Benett's slaves full of cheer, âExcept when food is dear!â Benett, to keep it dear, Talking of cheaper beerâ Juice, and no pies! 5 Law working ruin well; Saints gladly bound for hell, Ticketed âLiars;â Gamblers employing us; Idlers destroying us; Squires cursing Manchester! Rickburning Lankester Wise as the squires. 6 Whigs, for th' exchequer's good, Lauding restricted food; Cheer'd by the House! Dead-alive Peasantry Lov'd by the Pheasantry! Colville exhorting them; Rous for exporting them! Why not ship Rous? 7 Young Wodehouse crustily, Old Wodehouse fustily, Crying dear wares; Married life dog and cat; Fat rascals scar'd and fat; Richmond to hawk his fish, Knatchbull to beg a dish Doom'dâAnd who cares? 8 Jacky Finality Still, for the âquality,â Trying to mend; Lords cracking Stithy's cup; Locking his smithys up; Vow'd to keep hare and quail Sacred to church and jail; Blind to the end! 9 Fast-and-Loose almost fast; Crack'd Stanley sent at last Where he'll seem wise; Plenty the farmer's hell, Sliding scale works so well! Radnor, and Common Sense, (Confound their impudence!) Calling lies lies. 10 Daily a stinted store Dooming its thousand more Hopeless to strive, Till mind o'er might prevail; Or till endurance fail? Till the oppressor die, By gaunt Extremity Eaten alive! 11 Man against man array'd, Famine their battle blade, Struggling for doom! Starv'd Erin's catholic, Mining in Bishoprick; Brimless hat, lacking crown, Starving the saxon down, Till the end come! 12 Gunpowder quenching flame; Jesus a hated name, Worship a breath; Inglis sublime as Thom; Government Peeping Tom; Hunger the only Power! Scowling round town and tower, Darker than death! 13 Toil earning wretchedness; Capital profitless, Eating his teeth! Grim mis'ry's tongue of fire Seen o'er the famine-spire! Sorrow and verity Sobbing, âProsperity Moulders beneath!â 14 Cobden, our âMan of Men,â Doing the work of ten, Each worth a score!

Who wins prize, but he that's reeking With the taint of souls unclean? Shall I, on my kind's prostration Waste the hour that should be bless'd? Hoarded for mute conversation With the best thoughts of the best! If my trust in man is shaken, By thy trust in wrong-divine, Vilely is thy greed mistaken In this gold-edg'd gift of thine. âBorn-thralls are we?â The blood rushes To my forehead.âWhen wilt thou Pay me for these burning blushes, And the heart's pang on my brow? Criticise thee? Let them praise thee Who praise turncoats, turn'd anew. None could lower, and I can't raise thee; Turncoat Yellow! Turncoat Blue! Backward go to worse from better They alone whom badness feeds: Steal ye fire, to forge a fetter? Roses would ye turn to weeds? Sloe to plum improv'd not rashly: Time bears blessings on his flood! Honour, then, thy go-back Ashley, While we grow the greatest good. The magnum bonum, a plum bigger and better than his ancestors, if he is descended from the sloes, as Mr. Adams suggests, in his masterly article on Human Progress. Lives in every leaf and blossom Might that mocks Romanzoff's power: Worship thou his barren bosom! I will tend my little flower. Spite of thee, on this I anchor: Man by Man shall still be bless'd! Man, and Man's! till strife and rancour Sink, in love, to endless rest. SUNDERLAND'S GLORY. Printed some years before the fall, in honour of Monopoly's greatest and worthiest champion. 1 God, save King Hum the Fifth! If he give Numb a lift, Great is George Hum! Richmond's not wholly done; Thanks to Numb's holy one, Humbug's Napoleon, Buckingham's bum! 2 If he pay Well-content Ten out of two per cent., Hey for George Hum! Luck is not wholly gone, Thimblerig's holy one, Humbug's Napoleon, Buckingham's bum! 3 If out of Underfed Calfhead get Featherbed, Welcome George Hum! Miracle's solely done Now, by George Wholly Gone; Humbug's Napoleon, Buckingham's bum! JOINT-STOCK IN DECEMBER 1845. 1 Dupe sells his all for lies! Work thinks Sir Swindle wiseâ Pays, and departs, Signing for fifties ten: Swindle wastes Millions, then! Rabbit-Skin Railways thrive! Bus-ma-cu's monkey's drive Jobs o'er crush'd hearts! 2 What, now, are land and gold? Gambler's bets, bought and sold! Clerk means M.P.! Lords knee George Hum the Fifth: Hum gives lord Numb a lift: Greedy's âGreat Godâ is Hum! God! what a day will come, When the blind see? They who could, and do not, prevent an evil, are, in part, its authors. Our law-making class, who are said to have gained more by the late Railway-Madness than any other class, could have prevented that madness, without leaving us one railway too few, by enacting that no projector of a Railway should cease to be a shareholder until the work was finished; and that no share in any unfinished railway (such shares being mere bets in writing,) should be saleable, or legally depositable as a security for money lent. But a further enactment is necessary for the safety of good-faith shareholders in all joint-stock companies. No deviation from an obtained Act of Parliament, if it would involve an additional outlay of twenty-five per cent. or more, should take place without the consent first had in writing of two-thirds of the shareholders in number and value; their consent to be afterwards confirmed by the majority of a public meeting, specially called. DOGGREL FOR DUPES. Who's a dead canal to sell, Worth a skinn'd cat's clothing? Who will buy a dead canal, Dog cheap, and worth nothing? Rig off-hand your dead canal, Worth a skinn'd cat's clothing; Rig off-hand, and lump the lot, Dog cheap, and worth nothing. At five hundred thousand pounds, Where pluck'd geese, are cry it; Wink at Railway Shareholders! And the dolts will buy it. It is a fact, that on the third of December 1845, the good-faith shareholders in a job-of-jobs which will cost eight millionsâand which I will call The Gorse, Ling, Rabbit-Skin, and Shrimp Railwayâwere induced by their directors to guarantee forever the interest of about six hundred thousand pounds, to the proprietors of sundry dead canals, not worth sixpence! the vendors of one of which publicly feted the secretary of the purchasers! Need we wonder, if, some three years later, the shareholders of this Railway were urged by their directors to oppose government surveillance? If the history of the concern were truly written, I believe, such a plica polonica of folly or wickedness would be laid bare, as never yet met public exposure. WAS IT A DREAM? When Hum the Fourth (that woolpack of a man, Dubb'd Whale of Victory,) had clos'd the feast Of carnage, which his blood-burst sire began, And his humm'd people from rejoicing ceas'd, (As well they might, while reading in dismay The bill for bloodshed which they had to pay,) I dream'd a vision that had come to pass! Lo! near a pool, whence thick black slime did glide, Graz'd a huge, fat, blind, many-headed ass; And while with plenty flow'd the champain wide, The blind ass shook his ears, and prophesied That winds would blow, streams run, and oceans roll! Then, from the pool arose, with dogged stare, A babbler, famed for minimum of soul, His face like one half of a trencher square Set corner-wise upon a barber's pole; A wooden visage, that look'd somewhat droll With its best corner, like a snout, before. âBe still, ye troubled ears, and thou, Ass, peace!â Exclaim'd the ligneous feature: âWhy this roar? Wage war on nature, and thy fears will cease: Then, worst misrule will but encrease thy store, And make each truss thou hast worth two or more. War, War! wage War! and leave to me the Fates.â Thereat long bray'd the mighty many-ear'd, And shook the wood of ears on all his pates; Wide gaped his plural gab; and stiff he rear'd His fundamental plume! for much he fear'd (And now detests,) all bums that are not tail'd. âLet there be war!â he bray'd, and war there was. But still the rivers ran, the winds prevail'd, The seas roll'd, as before. What then? the ass Thought he grew fatter. But it chanc'd, alas, That men began to think it would be worse For them, if war should bring down the old sky; Some groan'd o'er emptied pouch, and some did curse; Some ask'd how ducks would swim when ponds were dry? But Ass in Wooden-Head's divinity Firmly believ'dâand doth so to this day. âPerish the future! let the present thrive!â Said then th' omnific Word; and 'gan display, While trembled every short-ear'd soul alive, A cobweb flag! This wav'd he o'er the hive Of workers, who deplor'd their riches gone. They shudder'd, when they saw his fingers foul, From which dropp'd hungry maggots, one by one, Into their porridge, or potatoe-bowl. But mighty Many-Ears, an ass of soul, Though born stone-blind, and with a smelless nose, Declar'd that grubs are manna from the sky. Nor was this all. Though still the tides arose; Though rivers did not leave their channels dry; And though the golden words of God on high Brightly denied th' Omnipotence of Ears; Yet prov'd the cobweb-flag a magic wand, That shook the boldest with resistless fears; And while that wooden statesman's putrid hand Fann'd it, in viewless wafture, o'er the land, None smil'd, save Knaves; but loudly laugh'd the mad, Ev'n at their prayersâand then they hang'd the sad! Meantime, the Ass, kicking the sick and thin, Through all his ever-gaping throats drank in The venomous air, and swelling like a whale, Bade the bright sun adore his rump and tail; And eke the scroll which did his rump adorn, Whereon a word of power was written black, Appalling her who limp'd, with garments torn, And famish'd baby dying on her back; While she, afraid to beg, still sobb'd âAlack!â This scene beheld a stern old wight, who chose To wear odd legs, whereof the one was small, And did not look like flesh and blood: Heav'n knows, Right fond he was of wounds, and cannon ball, And dev'lish loath to have a head at all! Yet ill thought he of certain honour'd knobs; For he had bled beyond the eastern foam, Where people die with dollars in their fobs; And now and then, your blockhead, forc'd to roam, Grows wiser than your dunce who stays at home: He was a war-worn and a woe-worn wight, Whom some call'd âGlory!â and he tried to reach, With hand thrown back, red rags (a sorry sight,) That hung behind, and once conceal'd his breech. His soul, too proud compassion to beseech, Turn'd from his own, to weep for others' woe; But he was one whom caution could not teach; He stump'd, with strange short jerkings, to and fro, And cried, with sudden gape, âMay God confound The thief, who sells ten shillings for a pound, And thrives by seething blotted rags in gore!â Next, lo, methought, around the monster's door, A mob of asses broken-back'd and grey, Bellow'd like billows on a rocky shore, With harmless kick, and multitudinous bray, âThat they were cheated in their daily hay!â But Many-Ears, to whom belong'd the land, Call'd one truss three, and would for three be paid! He curs'd the dolts who could not understand That One was Three; and ask'd them why they bray'd? Before them all a single truss he laid, And âLo, three trusses of sound hay!â said he: âThree! that they are three, thus, I prove, with easeâ Your fathers toil'd from morn to eve for three, And you shall toil from morn to eve for these! And Rascals! straw is hay, and chaff is corn.â TRUTH MORE STRANGE THAN FICTION. SceneâA wide plain, covered with skeletons and snow. Enter Payall and Allbelly. Payall. Heart of mud, and brain of steel! What hast thou been doing? Allbelly. Calming tumult, curing ruinâ Eating children, fathers, mothers, Nieces, nephews, sisters, brothers; Heap'd thousands at a meal. Payall. All-maw! all-cursing! all-accurs'd! Thou'rt loathsome as thy food. Allbelly. I eat them up, to do them good; To do them good, I starve them first. To plunder is to bless, To murder is to save: What could men less, in thankfulness, Than feed this living grave? But not their flesh alone Doth my vast hunger need; On torture's groan, on famine's moan, On mute despair I feed: My fateless greed Their all of life controls; I eat their souls. The plain is suddenly darkened, and a gigantic Shadow enters, deepening the gloom. Shadow. [To Allbelly.] Eternal Stink! where are my children? Allbelly. Here. Shadow. Where? Allbelly. I am they. Shadow. Maggot! hast thou no fear of me? Allbelly. Thee? I am Maggot. Shadow. [To Payall.] Misery! Hast thou no hope? Payall. None, none,ânor trust in thee: Why should I have, if thou permitt'st to be That loathsome monster? or a thing like me? I am indebted for this drama to T. et P. of L., near Sheffield, Esq.; for it originated in a conversation which I lately had with that gentleman in a railway carriage, when Landlordism in Ireland was destroying its victims by hundreds of thousands! he asserting the worn-out and infernal blasphemy, That the Cornlaws were enacted to benefit the consumers! One would think that our Protectionists (if they are, as they seem never tired of proving, at once, the worst and the most insolent of criminals,) might be satisfied with having escaped hanging; yet they continue to act as if they thought themselves still privileged to outrage the common sense of every victim whom they have not yet quite succeeded in stamping into the grave! August 21st, 1847. ERIN, A DIRGE, FOR APRIL, 1847. 1 Oh, for snow, strange April snow, Cold and cheap! a shroud of woe For pale dead Erin's nakedness! Snow-clad Broom, oh, drooping broom, Hearse of snow, of plumes a plume, Weep over Erin coffinless! 2 There are colder things than snow, Sadder things than death and woe, Proud Rapine's cold hardheartedness! And that saddest, helpless pain Which, when struck, strikes not again! Now wordless, lifeless, coffinless. 3 Insect, that would'st God enthrall! Earning nought, and taking all! Art thou thy country's nothingness? Man! whom that vile insect's will Yet may torture, starve, and kill! Remember Erin coffinless. 4 How men treat subjected man, When they may do what they can, Well knows scourg'd India's wofulness; Well, Bengal, thy famish'd dead (Victim-myriads o'er thee spread!) Forespoke of Erin coffinless. 5 Oh, thou snow-clad forest-bough! In thy sun-lit glory now, Laugh not at death's wide wastefulness; But lament, while brightly glows April's noon o'er Winter snows, A nation dead and coffinless! 6 Andâoh! pale unshrouded one, Cover'd by the heav'ns alone! A white sheet now shall cover thee: Help is vain, but help is nigh; And thy friend, the pitying sky Shall throw a cold sheet over thee. TO THE DEVIL. Sir! Parson Meek saysâand I'm bamm'd If that shows Christian spiritâ That save as flogger of the damn'd, You've not a spark of merit. â'Tis well,â your honour's thinking now, âWhen such as he despise you?â Give us your hand, then! and allow An old friend to advise you. Do not, as godliest souls require, Be always scalding, skelping; And pickling sinful souls in fire, Or listening to their yelping. If when you dance, your merriest hops Wheel round the young beginner; If when you choose your whipping tops, You pick the weakest sinner; If such sad doings are your jokes, You'd best relax your rigour, Or in the eyes of decent folks, You'll cut a sorry figure; And by and by, the imps who run, Through every grade of curship, And thrive by drowning cats for fun, Will scorn your honour's worship. SAY âNO!â AND LIE. Said he that we are loath'd, abhorr'd? That Britain's name is now a word For scorn to spit on? Can it be true, that for the right Poles, Germans, Romans, Magyars fight, And not one Briton? To wrong the right, and raise the wrong, Against the weak, we aid the strong!</field>
