      <field name="fulltext">Poems of Ms. Tiber. E VIISquare brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. (by William Nassyngton?). 1. (St. Mary's lamentation to St. Bernard on the passion of Christ).The attribution of this poem is questionable. Fader and sun and hali gaste, almighti god in trinite, þurgh bisekeing of Mari chaste, maiden and moder of pete, als I am sinful, help in haste, lorde, þou send sum grace to me sum word to say þat be noght waste, bot þat oure saules þe better be. It es grete dole to tel or say or forto think in mannes mode how Crist opon þe gude friday for vs sched his blissed blude; al his desiples fled oway, for drede of ded þai war nere wode; it es no tung þat tel þam may þe sorowes of Mari, his moder gude. For scho him bare bath god and man, and seþin þai cald his name Ihesu; þai offerd him to sir Simion— þat prophet wele his louerd knew; an angel sun warned þam þan of king Herod þat was vntrew, and bad Mari til Egipt gane for drede of ded of mani a Iew. Mari euer had ioy inogh whils sho was hir dere sun neghe; into what stede so euer he drogh come he neuer out of hir eghe. seþin men did him mekel wogh and mekil dole scho saw him dreghe: his handes nayled þai til a bogh and on a tre hanged him heghe. Of sorows sere myght scho noght sese when he was bludi bak and croune, and scho wist þat he was sakles; of bodi and bak þe blude ran doun; to se his pine was ful grete prese of folk þat folowed him out of toun; wemen wepid, withowten lese, and pleined mekil his passioun. Ihesus turned him to þam þare and spak þir wordes of grete pete: wemen, wepes for me no mare, bot for ?owre-seluen wepe mai ?e, and for ?owre childer ?e mai haue care, þat dose me shame als ?e may se”. no wonder if hir hert was sare þat saw hir sun so pined be. When he was (beten) with scourges st(rang), his frendes to fle war ful wight; þan oure trowth al hally hang in Mari milde both day and nyght. Saint Bernard beres witnes omang, so dose saint Iohn hir cosyn right, þat sorow so to hir hert thrang þat blude ran of hir eghen bright. Þe blude out of hir eghen so ran; for care hir hert nere clefe in two. Saint Bernard, þat haly man, beres witnes þat it was so. for til a kirk wightly he wan whare he might wit more of hir wo; scho schewed hir þare, and asked him þan what he wald, or scho went him fro. He sayd: “if þat it war þi will, tell me, lady, heuyn quene, how þou for wo wepyd þi fill when þai did þi sun slike tene, band him ful fast &amp; bet him ill, and corond him with thornes kene, and gert him bere vnto a hill a cros, and toyled him þam bitwene. A, lady, whare wastou for wo when þai him band and bet so fast? I wote þou wald noght fle him fro, so was þi hert stif and stedfast. allas, he said, whi was it so and my hert noght alto-brast or els for care to-cleue in two, or wepe whils þat my life may last? Lady, he said, þou had grete pyne when þat þou saw þat freli fode his heuyd doun so law enclyne when he was hanged on þe (rode); al-if he war goddes sun and þine, his faire fless famed al of bl(ode). allas, whine had þat bale be (mine)? I wald haue standen wha(re þou stode)”. “Bernard, scho said, who (list to loke) when my dere sun to ded (was dight)? he bowed his heuyd and (leue toke) thankand his fader (ful of might). þe stones brak als (sais þe boke), þe son also with (drogh his light); þe temple clef, (þe erthe quoke), þe ded to lyfe (ras ful right)”. “(Ladi, he s)ayd, tak noght (to grefe) (if I) speke of his paynes strang; (of) þam to lere war me ful lefe more graythli, or þou fro me gang. þou saw þi sun hing als a thefe wounded sare and al with wrang; to wit him haue so grete meschefe no wonder if þou murned omang. Now, lady, quene of heuen-blis, sen þat no gamyn to me may gayn, out of my wo þe bus me wis, al-if I b[e] sin(ful) for sertayn. als þou ert mayden and moder his: what did my lord in al his payne? when he was pined and did no mys, whilk war his wordes? þis wald I frayne”. “Bernard, scho said, þi bousom bede into mi hert has smeten a spere: for who so neuyns my dere sun ded, vnto me do þai þan grete dere, (fo)r wepeing mase me wil of rede. and ?it I may none wise forbere, what so þou fraynes here in þis stede (þi) wepeing gers me gif answere”. “(I tha)nk þe, lady faire and fre, (þat) þou wil cumforth me of care (and s)ogat schew þi hert to me (and) tel me of his paines sare. (wald) god þat I had bene with þe (and) sene þe sorow þat þou saw þare! (þan mig)ht I euer in wepeing be (and þi)nk þaron for euer mare. (Þou has sene) lordes vntil him lout euer þai might him seghe; (of his) dedes þai had grete dout, haly and highe. (when þat) þai presed so him obout, (whi sufferd he) þam so forto leghe, (in his face) to spit and spout, (how might he al þir) doles dreghe?” “(Mekeli he sufferd) þat mischefe— (and wald haue sufferd m)ekil mare— (for mannes saul was) him so lefe; (for him he sufferd) þo paines sare. (I saw him hang he)ghe als a thefe, (he saw I stud in sorow a)nd care; (?it did mi weping him m)ore grefe (þan al þe paines he suffe)rd þare. And sertainly þat (was wel sene) when he bitoke me vnto (I)on; ful meke he was withowten wene when þat him liked to luke me on, for wa I wex both gul and grene, of murnig may I mak my mone.— I sal þe tell hali bydene þe paines he sufferd euerilkone”. Þan Bernard toke to hir rewarde and thanked hir with hert ful sare; forto here of his lufli larde him thoght it was a like and lare. Sho said: “sen I þis space haue spared to tell þe sorow þat I sau þare, here efterward sal be declared paines a thowsand tymes mare. Bernard, i saw mi dere son hang als he had bene a maister-thef, with sides blo als þai him dang þat are war white and me ful lefe, corund he was with thornes strang; ful gern þai soght to do him grefe: þai drogh him out with rapes olang opon þe cros, til his fless clefe. When þat he was so straitli sted, þe cursed Iewes liked ful wele! al with blude his cors was cled and with spiting fro heuid to hele. opon þe cros so was he spred, and nailed with thre nailes of stele; þus was he drawen &amp; laithli led— and for mans dedis was ilkadele. I saw als it foure welles ware, fro ilka naile a streme of blude; al þus with dole þai dight him þare þe Iews þat war wilde and wode. I had grete blis when I him bare, so war his maners milde &amp; gude: seþen was al turned to sorow sare when he was rugged &amp; rent on rode. So faire a fode was neuer nane, and þat beres witnes hali writ; þare was his fairhed fro him tane, with filthes fouly was he smyt. and sertes I was so wil of wane me wanted hali welth and wit; I had no gates graithli to gane, with sorowes so mi hert was hit. (I wald þai had me han)ged him by, to ses my paynes in þat plas; no wonder if I war sary (t)o tharn mi ioy and my solace. (þ)e Iewes bad I sold me hy (þ)eþin oway tyte better pase: bot fast efter him folowed I and saw al paines þat he in was. Ful fast I cried on my manere to lat him gang and get his pese: bot my crying wald þai noght here ne in his paynes do no relese; for al my site and sighing sere his sorow wald þai no thing sese. I said: ‘Ihesu my sun so dere, whi lattes þou þam merk me þis mese?’ Wit þou wele ful wa me was when þai him nailed thurgh hend &amp; fete; ful loud I cried and said ‘allas’, when þat I saw his wowndes wete, ‘my lord, mi sun and my solase, þat euer has bene so mylde &amp; swete, haue mercy on me or þou pas, or els no blis mi bales may bete’. I said: ‘my sun þat euer was hende and blith to do what I þe bad, whi leues þou me þus at þe ende to dwell in site and sorow sad? lord, lat ded now in me lende— of his cumyng wald I be glad; so sone he may noght with me wende þat I ne wald soner þat he me had’. I made my mane to þe Maudelayne me forto cumforth in þat case; ‘þou pray for me with might &amp; mayne vnto him þat þe helpid hase, so þat I might alsone be slayne with pain or euer I pas þis place, for I wald be ded ferly fayne: and þou for me na murnig mase?’ Þe Maudelain said: ‘I can no rede, for sorow es set in me so sare; þi colure þat was white and rede es now al wan with dole and care; I se my souerayn draw to ded, and ?it [þi] murnig greues me mare. I wald we went out of þis stede, into þe tempil I rede we fare’. (I askid hir whar was) swilk (place) oþer in dale or els on hill whare I migh be sperd in þis space so þat no care sold cum me tyll; my ioy, mi blis and my solace despitusli I se þam spill; my welth al halely in him was: now es no wight in werld so will’. I cried vnto my sun so hende, and said: ‘in werld me es ful wo! I may noght help þe als þi frende to ger þi famen fle þe fro. ful lang in sorow here we lende, þe Maudelayn &amp; oþer mani mo: wele better vs war oway to wende: bot sertes I may noght fra þe go’. Þe Maudlayn cumforth me of care, to wende oway scho sayd war best, it helpid noght oure dwelling þare, for of rewth myght we haue no rest. I said to hir: ‘whider sold we fare or walk for wo by est or west? ded with him I wald we ware, allas, whine wald oure hertes brest? I se my sun twa theues bytwene naked &amp; nayled opon a tre; ful blith &amp; blissed euer has he bene, and now has ded tane him fro me. slike sorow sertes was neuer sene als we now on my sun may se: I war noght kind, þat wele [I] wene, when he þus hinges if I suld fle. Vnder þe cros here bide I will, I wate in werld no better w(on); of murnig might I haue (mi fill) so forto sit and se him on. here will I hald me on þis (hill), if þat ?e wende oway ilkon; with mi sun sal I bide her (still), and fle I will for (Iewis non)’”. Bernard þan answerd (hir ogaine) and til hir softly gan (he sai): “ful grete mater had þ(e Maudelain), it es no man þat þi bale was I ful bot þeder I durst how þat þai more forto þou has ferdenes als þou þam fand, my hert es ful hard to holde and al þi wordes to vnderstand. bot what my lord to þe say wolde to aske þe ?it will I noght wande, when þe Iews so breme and balde nayled him thurgh fute and hand, And when þai corond him with thorn þat newly war tane of þe tre. þou was ay redy him byforn, I wate [mare] might none euer be. þai hailsed him with many a scorn, als oþer men has tald to me: what answerd he on euyn and morn? to tell me, lady, pray I þe”. Sho sayd: “I haue talde þe my thoght, what wald þou now wit of me mare? ay when þat sorow es furth soght it mase my hert in sighing sare. bot if it may amend þe oght (?it forto) knaw more of mi care, (vnto) þe sal I nyte right noght (a)t tell þe fully or þou fare. (Mi sun) þat died at þe houre of none (he) said to me on þis manere: ‘(wo)man, be noght will of wone, (biha)ld þi sun bisid þe here’. (þan) said he to my cosin Iohn: ‘(bihald) þi moder lefe and dere’. (ay)þer luked we oþer opon (sari)ly with symple chere. (He said: ‘Ion, als) þou ert hende, (be ay) redy vntil hir bone; (luke to) hir whare scho will wende (als I bifor wa)s won to done. (here I mai) no lenger lende (for my time) es cumand sone, (heþin now bihou)es me wende (on hegh vnto my) fader in trone. (Moder þat mi) bodi bare, (it es hard pined) als þou mai se, (for al man-kind als I) said are (fra ded to lif suld) raised be. (I sek a schep, suld els) forfare, (þat with wrang was stolen) fro me; (I sal it bring þar it was are) (and of his þraldom mak it) fre. Þat schepe bitakens (mannis kinde), my fader will þat it be soght; oþer þan I may none it finde, for with mi blude it bus be boght; out of þe place whare it es pynide to bigly blis it sal be broght’. he said I suld leue him bihinde; þarfore ful dreri was my thoght. Þus war his wordes more and myn þat Ion my cosyn to me suld luke. al-if he war nere of my kyn, for my sun þare I him toke. al with swilk talking gan we twin, and my solace so I forsoke. þir wordes þat þus gan bygin ful wide þai sal be wreten in buke. Bot a thing, Bernard, did me wo: when my sun said ‘me thristes sare’. to get him drink fast gan þai go with grete despite wald þai noght spare, aysell and gal þai menged so, and in a spounge þai hid it þare; þai bad him baldely þareof to and drink on fast, he sold haue mare. I cried þan: ‘dere sun, drink it noght! for hething wald þai þou it had; of aysell and gall es it wroght, sune of þe sauore þou mai be sad’. ful mildly þan he me bysoght so þat I suld be blith and glad; ‘for with þis drink man-kind es boght, it bus be als my fader bad. Þarfor, moder, þi murnig mend, and for me murn þou now nomare! vnto mi fader bihoues me wend and lede ogayn þat lost was are. and sune efter þe sal I send— bot me byhoues bifor þe fare; and seþin saltou with me lend in ioy and mirth for euermare’. Þe Iews ful of pomp and pride hanged two theues despitusly bi mi dere sun on ayther side; þe tone to him gan merci cri, þe toþer answerd in þat tyde: ‘he hinges hegher þan þou or I, and es wete with wondes wide: to ask him help þou dose foli’. (Þe t)oþer answerd with milde mode: ‘he es dampned with fals rede, for he did neuer no thing bot gude, and we haue wele serued oure ded. haue mercy on me, mayster gude, when þou cums vp in þi stede; thurgh vertu of þi blissed blude þe way to blis, lord, þou me lede!’ My sun said: ‘þou askes rightwisly, for þine asking blissed þou be; þis day grante I þe forþi in paradis to won with me’. I saw þat sight, and was sary when þat þai died so on þe tre; þe gude thefe went to heuyn in hi, and þe ill to hell went he. To se þat sight I had solace how tyte þe tone vnto heuyn wan; for wele I knew þan by þat case my sun was verray god &amp; man. and als I stode still in þat place, to cry ful loud my sun bygan: ‘ely ely’, his criyng was, ‘lamazabatany’ efter þan”. þir wordes er als men may se in ynglis tung to vnderstand: “‘fader, whi forsoke þou me, þus to be bun in [b]itter band? heder I come thurgh rede of þe: mi saul I send into þi hand. for man þus am I pined on tre: now es fulfild als þou cumand.’” Bernard þan to hir answerd: “Lady, blissed mot þou be; of schere-thursday now haue I herd how þi dere sun was tane fro þe, and on gude friday how it ferd, how þat he died opon a tre; bot now, how he in graue was sperd, ladi, þat tale now tell þou me. And how þat he was taken doun tel me, moder &amp; mayden mylde, of þe cros efter his passioune, and how þai wroght þan with [þi] childe, and how þat Ioseph come to toune þi sun bodi for he wald bilde; he wan it with his orysoune fro Pelat and þe Iewes wilde. (And how he was laid in þe ston) tell me, mayden and moder fre; whilk of his frendes euerilkone walde þare at his beriyng be; þe murnyg of þe and of Iohn, mayden mylde, mene vnto me— for wele I leue ?e left allone with-owten mo of ?owre men?e”. “Bernard, scho said, allas allas, þir wordes dose me mikell wo; to tel al halely how it was my hert for bale might brest in two. Ioseph gan vnto Pilate pas, and asked þe bodi þat hanged so; and both Pilat and sir Cayphas gaf him leue it doun forto to. Pelates knyghtes sterne and stout furth with Iosep gan þai wende, and oþer folk a ful grete rout— sum was his fa &amp; sum his frende; þai brak þe theues the-banes obout, to luke if þaire life had made ende. þat þai sold do so had I dout with my sun þat was so hende. I foloud fast with al my myght, with Ion and with my systers two. omang þam þare þan stode a knyght, blind he was and lame also, and al þai said Longius he hight; vnder þe cros þai gert him go— and sertes þan I saw a sight þat was þe werst of al my wo. Þai gaf þe knyght a spere ful gude, and set it to my dere sun side, þai bad him sting fast þare he (stode) for any thing þat might bi-(tide). he put it up with eger mode, to my sun hert he gert it (glide): and sune brast out both (water &amp; blude) of þat wound þat was (so wide). Þe blude ran doun vntil hi(s hand), and þarwith wiped þe knight so gat he sight als he and luked brade with e and thanked god of (al his sand), liftand his hert to þat sight saw (I þar I gan stand), and oþer mo (Þan wex mi hert heui als led) (when) I saw þat rewful sight, þe water clere and þe blude rede þat ran out of þe wownde ful right; þan fel I doun als I war ded, langer to stand had I no might. Ion me comfort in þat stede, so did Ioseph þat nobil knyght. Þan went þe knyghtes to sir Pilate, and I left þare ligand in swowne: and when I couerd out of þat state, I prayed Iosep to tak him doune and get him þeþin by any gate fro þe Iews fals and felowne. Ioseph said: ‘lat be þi late; to bring him þe er we ful boun’. Nichodemus þe nayles out drogh, and Ioseph lapped him in his arme— both þai lufed him wele inogh, and toke him doun withowten harme. (þai) lesed mi barn þus fro þat bogh and broght him euyn vnto my barme: I kissed his mowth with mekil wogh— cald it was and nothing warme. (An) hundreth siþes gan I kis his mowth and als his eghen two, (and said): ‘dere sun, sen I þe mys (gla)d now sal I neuer go, (&amp; Ioseph) ful fast oboutward is (þat þou) war in þi graue me fro. (now in þis) werld who sal me wis? (whine) war I grauen with þe also?’ (To wepe) might I nothing forbere, (so was mi) hert enclosed with care; (his wou)ndes did me slyke dere (whilk I saw) on his body bare (mad of þe na)yles and of þe spere, (þat it wou)nded my hert ful sare; (all men sorow)ed þat þar were, (bot mi sorow) was mekil mare. (Slike sorow þar in) me was cast (þat I most wepe) on alkins wise; (bot ?it my hope ay) was stedfast he sold vp rise war past, (s)eruise; (ful wele wist I a)t þe last (I suld him se omang al hi)se. Had I noght and trowed þat he suld ris up right, Bernard, mi hert had brusten bene when mi dere sun to ded was dight. Ioseph &amp; Nichodeme þam bitwene to beriyng bare þat bodi bright; þai lapped it in clathes clene, and closed in a stane þat night”. “Now lady, quene of heuyn and hell, als þou him bare þat vs dere boght I pray þe þat þou wald me tell more of þi murnig if þou moght: whare wastou whe[n] þai did him dwell in Ierusalem, whare he was soght and taken with þe Iewes fell and byfor sir Cayphas broght?” “Bernard, þat sight I saw also, mi blissed barn how þai him band, and led him furth ful fast me fro; I folowd him ful sare wepeand. no wonder was if me war wo, bot more meruail how I might stand, at se mi sun to paynes go; to folow and wepe might I noght wand. On schere-thursday within þe night þai soght him, Iewes ful grete plente, with lanternes &amp; with swerdes bright, and ilkone asked ‘whore es he?’ ‘I am here’, he said ful right, ‘bot dose my men no harm for me’— he wist what dole to him was dight, þarfore he wald his frendes went fre. Al-if him-self to paynes ?ede, he wald none oþer þe wers ware; þat schewd he by his speche gud spede both in þat stede and els whare. Peter gan his swerde out lede and Malkus ere sune of he schare; my sun him blamed for þat dede and hastily he (he)lid it þare. Iudas þat was (ful) of þe fende, al-if mi sun his treson wist, at his cumyng he cald him frende and curtaisli þare he him kist. þan knew þai wele my sun so hend, þai laid hand on him als þam list; omang þam al no man him mende. on þis manere my mirth I mist. and seþin (to Pilat), him to spill; my dere sun was noght ferd forþi, bot þeder went he with gude will; he kid noght þat he was myghty, bot bare him euer simpil and still. Pilate sayd he suld noght dy, for in him fand he none kins ill. Þai hid his eghen and band him fast and bet him þan with buffettes sare, and bad him rede wha smate him last, a trew prophet if þat he ware. two of my sisters þeder past forto se þat sorow and care, and þe Maudelaine was noght last— scho lufed him lely and his lare. Hir luf to him was euer new, to wirschip him als was worthy. ful strang es luf of frendes trew, and of þe moder maste namly. he was so faire of hide and hew, my murnig was þe more forþi; al men him lufed þat euer him knew, slike blis it was to beld him by. Þai nakend him þan in þa stoundes and till a peler band him al bare, and bet him þan þare in þaire boundes despitusly wald þai noght spare; foure thowsand and sex hundreth woundes dight þai on his sydes ful sare, and cried on him on heght als houndes: ‘þi propheci mendes þe nomare’. Bernard, I was ful will of rede when þat I herd þam sogat say þat Ihesu sold be done to dede and Baraban go quite for ay. it was þe custum in þat stede to saue ane on þaire sabot-day; god sun þai slogh with wikked red, and lete a thef go quie oway. Þus þe Iewes ful sterne and stout held my sun in ful hard band. Pilat had of þam more dout þan of him þat was alweldand: he rase up right omang þat rout and liuerd him into þaire hand. þan presed þai bremely him obout, and euer ful mekeli gan he stand. (When he was dampned þan þai went) with him out of þe tun ful tite, þe cros opon his bac þai bent and waited to do him despite. allas þat lamb þat innocent þat neuer was worþi to wite, omang þa wolues was to-rent. I folowed fast with sorow and site. Þe Iewes war fayn when he fore ill, and fast þai logh, both moste and leste: ‘if þou be king tell vs vntill, so þat þi payn may be relest’. he answerd noght bot held him still, with countynance fayre and rest, and bare þe cros vp to þe hill ful bousumly als any beste. I swouned þan ful many a sith, so did wemen þat war with me; I cried loud, for he suld me lith, when I for prese might him noght se: ‘A sun, whi hies þou þe so swith sen þat þou beres so heuy a tre, and lattes þi moder be vnblith, and oþer frendes þat folowes þe?’ Sen heuyn was and erth also and Adam merked efter man, had neuer woman so mekil wo ne care in hert als I had þan. now haue I tald bitwen vs two of grete greuance sen I bygan; ?it may I mene of many ane mo, fro his graueing how þat we wan”. Þan wald Bernard no speking spare bot til hir said he sone onone: “I thank þe, ladi, of þi lare, þat þou to me will mak þis (mone). when he was ded als þou said are and stalworthli stoken in ston, forþermare how gan ?e fare, þe Maudlayne and þi cos(yn Ion)?” “Sertes, Bernard, þe soth grete hardnes þan in h when þai þe stone wal for wa þan wex I al þe heuynes might I ouer him hertly g I wend to were þe so þat my so þai gan me (win), (ilka)ne at oþer leue þai toke and led me home vntill owre in. for sorow I might speke ne luke, and al þai murned more and myn. no wight in werld might write in buke oure bitter bale þat might noght blin. Intill a chamber þai gert me go whare mi dere barn was won to be; Ion and þe Maudelayn went also, for no thing wald þai wend fro me. I wayted obout in ilka wro bot of my sun kouth I noght se; omang vs was so mekill wo þat in swounyg we fell al thre. Þus war we set in sorows sare, and out of bale might none vs bring, til þat we wist how he sold fare þat was oure conforth ouer althing. now haue I tald þe of my care, (wh)at pain I had in his parting; bot efter I was ful redi þare to luke efter his vprising”. (Saint) Bernard said: “my ladi fre, I thank þe, moder and maiden milde, þat þou wald þus mene vnto me (þe) sorow of þe and of þi childe. (now) am I seker, whare so I be, (þat) his passioun sal me schilde (fra þe fend) and his powste, (and also) fro al werkes wylde.” (Now, ladi,) for þat mekyll wo (and þe murn)yg þat þou made omell, (þe pas)sioun of þi sun also (&amp; his d)ed so foule and fell, (lat vs neu)er depart þe fro, (bot grant vs) euer with [þe] to dwell, (and heþen owai) when we sall go (schild vs fro) þe paynes of hell. AMEN. 2. (R. Rolle's Form of living, in verse).The attribution of this poem is questionable. (Ilka man þat bunden es) (in dedli sin), has (thre wrechednes), þat bringes þam to þe ded of hell; and whilk þai er I sal ?ow tell. Þe first es defaut of gastly strenkith þat þai sold haue þaire liue to lenkith; þat mase þam so wayk in al thinges þat þai may noght gainstand fandinges, ne þai may noght lift vp þaire will þe luf of god at ?erne vntyll. Þe toþer es vse of flesli syn and a desire to dwell þare-in, and for þai haue no will to stand in lustes er þai lightly falland, and [in] þaire lustes so will þai lend many vnto þaire liues end. Þe thrid wrechednes es chanieing of lastand gudes for pasand thing, als when þai leue þe ioy endles for vaine ioy here þat pasand es. and if þai turn þam ald or ?ing, god will ordaine þaire wonyng with angels and with hali men, þaire wrechidnes if þai wil ken; bot for þai folow þe filth of sin and likes more to lend þarein þan in þe grete fairehed of heuyn, both it and þe werld lose þai euyn. For he þat has noght Ihesu Criste, al gude thing es fro him rauist; al creatures sal uengance cry on him in dome, als es worthi.— Þir wrechidnes er noght anly in þam þat luffes here licheri and glotony and oþer sines þat þaire luf oft fro god twines: bot þai er in sum man and wife þat semes in penance and gude life. For when þe fende ful of enui can parcayue here preueli þat man or woman, ald or ?ing, wald turn þam vnto gude lifing and forsake werldly vanite, a hundereth wiles þan has he to put þam fro swilk purpose sune, and ger þam leue yf oght be done; and so warly oft will he wait þat þai sal noght se his desayt. Sum (he desaiues) thurgh þe syn of erroure þat he puttes þam in; and sum with singulere wittes here, when þai think on þis manere, whare so þai walk by est or west þat þaire owin wit euer es best, and þarfore will þai no counsayle al-if it might þam mekil avayle, his a wit think him best of all— þat gers him oft in folis fall; þis es a stinkand sin of pride, þat þe fend gers walk ful wide. Sum he desaiues thurgh vain glori, þat es idel ioy, als when any has pride in hert on ill manere of penance þat þai suffer here, or els of gude dedes þat þai do, or uertus þat er gifen þam to; and er sari when men þam lackes, and meri when men rose of þam maks; þam think þaire werkes &amp; þaire gude dedes fer passes þe lif þat oþer ledes; þam think þat no man, ald no ?ing, suld reprehend þam in no thing; þai despise al sinful men þat will noght wirk als þai þam ken. how suld men find more sinful here þan he þat lifes on þis manere? and more sinful þarfore he es þat he wate noght his wrechidnes. Sum er desayued in lust &amp; liking of mete and drink outrage taking, when þai haue grete delite þarin and wenes þat þai do no syn, þarfore þai amend þam noght, and so þai er in bondage broght; al gude vertus þai put byhind, in þaire wittes er þai made so blind. Sum er bigiled thurgh abstinens fro mete and drink and oþer spens; þat es desayueing of þe fende to ger þam faile and þam-self schende, þat if þai bigin any thing, þai sall noght bring it to ending; and þusgat es þaire mede made les thurgh foli of þaire frawardnes. Þis gilder þe fende vntill man merkes when he bigins to luf gude werkes; he suffers of hert and (hend) Þat þai bring no gude werk till end; he gers þam wene at þai sall do more þan þai may atteyn vnto, and gers þam wene þaire werkes er lele, when þai do harm to þaire saul hele. For, als þir clerkes may knaw ful euyn, we haue a lang way vnto heuyn, and ay when we a gude dede do, a pase þan mak we heuyn vnto, and when we think gude thoghtes or pray, vnto heuen we mak vs way; þan, if we mak vs here so wayke þat vs list nowþer lif ne (l)ayke ne nowþir gude werkes forto wirk ne forto pray ne go to kirk— we er so febill we may noght rise ne be lastand in goddes seruise: me think we er worthi to blame, and aght forto think mekill shame, þat in oure werkes er failand when we had moste mister to stand. and sertes it es [noght] goddes will; þat proues þe prophet by þis scill: he said, “lord, I sal kepe mi might vnto þe both day and nyght”— his meneing was þan on þis wise, þat he suld maintene goddes seruis lastandly to his ded-day, and noght sune waste his strenkith (oway) and seþin lig waneand by þe waw. þat es more perill þan we knaw; Saint Ierom sais, to vnderstand, þat he makes of rauyn ofrand þat here will turment his body fro mete and slepe outrageusly. And saint Bernard sais þat f(asting) ne wakeing lettes noght g(astli thing) bot helpes it in ilk sesoune if it be done with discrecioune, and if discrecioun be n(oght) þan er þai tald vices al Þarfore to pine vs es (na nede) and þan haue vnth(ank for our dede). Bot þar er sum me(n þat wenes) þat þaire life es (noght al þai menes) bot if þai vse (swa mikil fasting) þat all (men spek þarof, ald &amp; ?ing): (bot oft þe mo ioy þai haue þen) (withow)ten of þe speche of men, þe les ioy haue þai within of þe luf of god þat neuer sal blyn. It war wele more to goddes honore to sustine þaire bodis in mesure and forto tak with gude talent what sustinance so god þam sent, forto maintene his seruyse, þan forto wirk on oþer wise, thurgh penance &amp; ypocrisy to ger þam be halden haly. for þe les þat men þaire gudnes neuyn, þe more it es with god of heuyn. What helpes it to more or les to haue þe abit of halines and be noght so, bot couer pride and ire and enuy on ilk side, and hide so many wikked dede vnder þe clothes of Cristes barnhede? (A) foul lust es it unparfite (of) oþer mens wordes to haue delite, (þat) of oure dedes may deme right noght namore þan þai may of oure thoght; (þ)arfore weþer þai say gude or ill, (a) man sold gif no tent þartill; (an)d if we hide oure werkes þen (fro) þe loueing of werldly men, (þan) will god for oure gudenes (sche)w vs ioy þat es endles. (For his) ioy es when alde and ?ing (has) strenkith to fell þe fendes fanding (and sekes) no thing forto haue (bot lu)f of god his saul to saue: (and þis de)sire of his luf smert (ay sul)d kyndel in oure hert, (and þe swetn)es of his grace (be oure comfo)rt and oure solace. (Lo þus hau)e I talde here now fende decayues &amp; how (men &amp; women) þat er noght quainte be ataynt; (if þou wil do bi gu)de counsayle (and folow lare þat mig)ht availe, (his malis sal turn him til) anoy (and al his trappis þou sal) destruy. God suffers þ(e fend to temp gud men) for þaire profit, als clerkes ken, þat þai sal be hegher in blis when [þai] haue ouercumen him and his. Þe fende on thre wise has powere forto dwell in a man here: Ane es, hurtand þe gudes of kind, als reuand men speche, wit &amp; mynde. Anoþer es thurgh þe gudes of grace, þat he makes men in many place to haue swilk delite and liking in werldli gudes þat es vain thing þat þai forget god euer omell and wendes with þe fende to hell. Þe thrid maner es, turmentand a mans body by water or land, als Iob was turment lifand here with maladies and sekenes sere. Bot wit þou wele, for ani gyn if he may noght temp þe within nowþer with his worde ne dede, withowten thar þe noght him drede; for vnto no man may he greue ferrer þan god will gif him leue. Þe fende, als hali writ witnes, transfigures him in sere liknes: sum tyme als ane angell of light tempes he men both day and night, and hides ill to ald and ?ing vnder þe liknes of gude thing. and þat es on two maners done: Ane es when he at morn or none egges men till esse of body and forto kepe þam tenderly; he sais if þat þaire fless be pinde, þai may sustyne [noght] wele þaire kinde, and þat es nede on alkins wise forto mai[n]tene goddes seruise; on þis wise makes he vs to think, bot if we ett wele and wele drink and lig soft and sit warm, els may we lightly haue grete harm, and els till end bese it noght won þe trauail þat we haue bygun; þus bringes he men both more &amp; les to lust and liking of þaire fless. Anoþer es when he thurg chance entices vs to grete penance of gastly gudes, and þusgat sais: “He þat moste hard life wil lede for goddes luf, sal haue most mede: þarfore ett lityl and febil mete, and thinest drink þat þou may gete, vse litel slepe, and were þe hayre, and fast mekill þi fless to payre, þat þare be none for nokins chance þat may pass þe in penance”. þus sais þe fende in þi conciens to sla þe with grete abstinens, right als he said þe toþer thing to sla þe with outrage etting. and þarfore, if we right lif wald, a gude mene bihoued vs hald, þar-thurgh we may gett oure saul bute and hald oure fless ay vnder fote, and suffer it to haue strenkith þarto at serue god als it suld do. Also oure [enmy] wil noght sese ne suffer vs here to rest in pese onightes, when we suld slepe a while: bot þan he sekes vs to bigile with uanitese, to mak vs glad, and sumtyme sightes to mak vs rad and ger vs lathe with oure awin state— for al oure febilles wele he wate. with faire sightes he makkes vs fain forto ger vs be glad in vaine, to ger vs wene so þat we er better þan we may be bi fer. sumtyme he puttes intil oure mode þat we er halden hali and gude, to mak vs proud of oure gude dede and so to ger vs lose oure mede; sumtyme he sais we er werst of all, at gerr vs into wan-hope fall and so forto di in despaire. Þus colures he his falshedes faire. bot god ful kindely wil vs kepe and saue, wheþer we wake or slepe, if we rewle vs efter his will, þat þe fende noght dere vs till. Þou sinnes noght slepeand, sais þir clerkes, if þou be wakeand with gude werkes, withowten outrage of mete and drink, and euil thoghtes on none wise think.

At þe biginnig enterely turn þe to god almighty. and þat es to mene on þis wise: turn þe fro al couatise and fro liking and bisines both of þe werld and of þi fless, so þat þi hert, þat was dounward whils þi hert in þe erth was harde, be vpward now als fire ful euyn, sekeand þe heghest place in heuyn, til þi spous whare he beldes in blis, and ?eren to won with him &amp; his. þi hert to god wele turned es when it forsakes sins more and les and fleis al felischippes of schrewes, and confouroms it to gude thewes and to debonerte and mekenes, and in goddes loueing lastand es, and es noght with nonkins strife, ne irkes noght with hardnes of life. Bot foure thinges bus him haue in thoght þat to parfite luf will be broght. Ane es, of þis life þe mesure, þat so schort time mai endure, þat vnnethes es oght forto tell, for als in a point here we dwell— þat es þe leste thing þat mai be; ?it es oure life wele les to se, if þat we haue rewarde alway vnto þat life þat lastes ay. Anoþer es þe vnsertainte of oure ending when it sal be; for we wate neuer when we sal deghe ne what dole þat we þan sal drighe, ne we wate neuer into what stede þat we sal turn when we er dede; god will lat vs no sertaine se for þat we suld ay redy be (in) what e we þus suld a man ay think in thoght. Þe thrid, þat we acount sal ?elde of al oure dedes in ?owth and elde bifor Ihesu, þe domes-man dere, and of al þe time þat we had here, and what oure bisines has bene. for þare sal all þe soth be sene; al euil dedes þat we here hid sal þare plainly be knawen &amp; kyd, and what gude werkes we might haue wroght when we war ydell and did noght. þarfore þe prophet sais sertayne: “Lorde, þou has calde þe time ogayne, to wreghe vs of oure wikkednes in al oure lifing more and les”. for ilkaday þat god has send in his seruise forto despend, in wikked werkes if we it waste, þarfore in bale we mun be braste and by it dere on domesday, bot if we mend it whils we may; and al þe time we waste to noght whils god es al-out of oure thoght. þarfore on him we suld think ay, and also on þat dredeful day. Þe ferth thing folowand es þis: forto think what ioy and blis þat þaire hertes er to rauiste þat lendes in þe luf of Criste lastandly ai whils þai lif, and al þaire hertes vnto him gif; for þai sal be, als clerkes ken, breþer with angels and hali men, in heuyn whare þai sall plainly se god in his grete maieste. þat sight ouer all es souerayn blis, and þareof sal þai neuer mis; it sal be to þam mete and drink and all þat þai will efter think. þare sal be more ioy þam omell þan ani man with tong mai tell; and to þat welth wele mai þai win þat here will kepe þam clene of sin. Also to think with gude entent what sorow and care and hard turment þat þai sal haue withowten ende, þe sinfull þat to hell sall wende, (þat lufed noght god whils) þai liued here bot filed þaire thoght with folies sere, als pride and ire and oþer syn. þarfore in bale-fire sal þai brin, þat es in þe fire of hell, with deuils þat þarein sal dwell; for þai sal dwell ay with þe fende right als gudemen with god sal lende. Þarfore luf god, als I said are, with all þi might and main euermare; and lat þi luf ay in him stand and more and more ay be waxand, and bigin þi luf so lawe þat þou may ai god better knawe, and set þi luf so sad in him þat þou may euermore upward clim; and noght bigin so highe thurgh ruse and cum dounward, als sum men dose þat ouer-grete penance wil bigin þat þai may noght til ending win, wharfore þai fail in goddes seruise— wha wirkes þus þai er noght wise. þi merit mai be neuer þe les if þou do noght so grete destrese vnto þi fles, at ger it faile; bot kepe þe klene, es my counsaile, and vmthink þe at morn and none to luf god more þan þou has done; þan sal þi luf be more and more, and þi mede ay waxand þarfore. He þat here will leli lyf and his luf all to god gif, stabilly sall he vnderstand þir foure thinges þat er folowand: Ane es what thing files a man; anoþer what thing clenses (him þan); þe thrid when þat he clensed es, what thing þan haldes him (in clennes); þe ferth what thing may a (man bring) at ordain him to goddes li(king).

Þe thrid, of satisfaccioun may rise; and þat es done opon thre wise: in fasting, prayers, and almusdedes— noght (anly to gif) pouer men þat nedes mete &amp; drink to þaire releues, bot to forgif þam þat þe greues and pray for þam with gude entent þat god bring þam vnto mendement, and enfourom both ald and ?ing (þat) er in poynt of perising. He þat clennes more wil kepe, within his hert to goddes wurschipe (it) bus kepe on maners thre; I sal þe tell how þat sall be. (Ane) es waker thoght and stabill, (þat) he to god be euermore abill. (An)oþer es besines to ?eme (þi fiue) wittes als best will seme, (so þat) ilkone in his degre (be rewli)de als him aw to be (&amp; wickid) stiringe þat in þam es (be closed cle)ne out of þi fless.

(Clennes of mouth bus keped) be (on) maners thre: (t)hoght (spe)ke oght, d nayd. Anoþer es þis, (als I þe teche), to be noght ouermekil (of speche); for he þat mikell carpand is sum tyme sall he say omis. Þe thrid es þat þou for no thing, ne for no mekenes, mak lesing on þi-self ne on none els, bot luke it be trew þat þou telles. Clennes of werk with ald and ?ing of thre thinges also has kepeing: Ane es assiduele thoght of ded þat maystris makes in mani a stede, and on his paynes þat er so (fell) and more þan any man mai tell; for þus men heres þe wiseman say: “vmthink þe, man, of þi last day, how þou out of þis werld sal twin, and þan, he says, þou sal noght syn”. Anoþer: he þat clennes will kepe byhoues fle all ill felaghschipe, þat more ensampill will to him neuyn to luf þe werld þan god of heuyn, and more to luf esse of bodi þan forto plese god almighty. Þe thrid es right disrecioune to ete and drink yn gude musoune, þat it pas noght right ordinance ne want of skilwis sustinance; for both es demid to ane ending, outrage, and ouer-mikell fasting; for nowþer es till goddes pay— þat will sum noght wene by no way. if þou tak sustinance of swilk gude als god þe sendes vnto þi fode, and out-tak no maner of mete þat cristen men vses fortill ette, and vse mesure in ilkadele and ett and drink: þan dose þou wele; on þat maner did Crist him-selue (in) erth here, and his apostels twelue. Bot if þou in þi-seluen se þat þou haue strenkith &amp; stalworth be in goddes seruise to pray and wake, and þou will fast þan for goddes sake, so þat þou no faintise fele to serue god þan dose þou wele; and if þou fast vntill þou fayle, þou sins and it sal noght availe. (For wit þou wele þat rightwi)snes nowþer in etting ne fasting es, bot if þou tak here with gude hert illike both riches and pouert, hunger, nede, catell to lese als gladli als delices and dayntese; if þou tak al þir ilyke wele, and loue god euer of ilkadele, and gruche noght for nokin thing, þan ertou rightwis in lifing. Also ?it may men forþer knawe oþer thre thinges, þat will vs draw forto confourme all oure will goddes liking forto fulfill. Ane es ensampill of halimen þat lely lifed, als clerkes ken, þat war ententyue night &amp; day at serue god euer vnto pay, and to luf him with al þaire might and to drede him both day &amp; night. þarfore now er þai hegh in heuyn, in more mirth þan men may neuyn; and if we folow here þaire trace, we sal won with þam in þat place. Anoþer es gudenes of god allane, þat al lufes and despises nane bot gladli takes and with gude will al þat in time will turn him till, and his mercy will to vs bede als oft-siþes als we haue nede, and hamlier he will vs take what time so we oure sin forsake, and angels of vs er more glad, þan ani frende þat euer we had; þan aght vs forto be ful fayne at gif oure willes to god ogaine. Þe thrid es noteful forto neuyn, þat es, for endles ioy in heuyn, þat es gretter &amp; more plente þan eres may here or eghen se or hertes think or tonges tell— wele es þam þat þare may dwell; and þat has god al hallely hight vnto al þa þat lufes him right and honors him in stede and stall. vnto þat blis he bring vs all. A.M.E.N. 3. Spiritus Guydonis.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Saint Michael goddes angell (clere), and saint Austin þe doctur dere, and oþer maisters mare &amp; myn, sais þat men grete mede may wyn and nameli clerkes þat can of lare, if þai þaire cunyng will declare vnto þe laude men þat can les, and namely thinges þat nedeful es, þe whilk may ger þam sese of sin and help þam vnto heuin at win. And saint Paul Cristes apostell dere sais till vs on þis manere: all þat þir clerkes in bukes rede er wretin anely for mans mede, so þat men may ensaumpill take to saue þaire saules and sins forsake and lede þaire liues more and les als haly bukes beres witnes. And for þat god of his grete grace will þat his pople in ilka place trow in thinges þat er to cum, als in ded and þe day of dome, and how ilk man sall haue his mede, be saued or dampned efter þaire dede: þarfore he schewes ensamples sere on þis molde omang vs here, to ger vs in oure trowth be stabill and lif in faith with-owten fabill, and so he will vs wisely wis at kepe vs clene and cum to blis. Þarfore who so will lyke to lere, a soth ensampill sall ?e here how it byfell byfor þis day; and þarfore beres it wele oway. It bifell in a faire sesowne, efter Cristes incarnaciowne a thowsand winter, be ?e bald, and thre hunderet, als clerkes (tald), and þarto thre and twenti (?er), þan byfell on þis maner. In Alexty þat nobil towne, þat threti mile es fro Ba(ioune), þe XII. kalend, als clerk(es tell), of decembre, als þan (bifell): A gude buriace þ(at hight Gy) in þat same (cete gan dy); (and when þe bodi in graue was laid), (vnto þe) saul slike grace was (graide), (vn)-till his wife it went ogayne and schewed hir porcioun of his paine; he did hir dole both day and night, bot of him might scho haue no sight; and in hir chamber oft might sho here mikil noyse and hidos bere, and oft scho was so rugged and rent þat for sorow sho was nere shent. þus was scho turment in þat stede egtene(!) dayes efter þat he was dede, and scho ne wist noght weterly wheþer it war þe gaste of Gy or it war funding of sum fende þat so pursuyd hir forto shende. Þarfore sone efter opon a day vnto þe freres scho toke þe way þat prechures war in þat cete, (we)le lifand men of gude degre, and to þe prior gan scho tell all þis ferly how it bifell, (i)n saint Iohn day þe euangeliste, þe thrid day efter þe birth of Criste; (þan) tald scho þe prior lest &amp; maste (how) sho was greued with þat gaste (and) how scho was sted in þat stede (sen) þe tyme þat hir lord was dede; (“Sir), scho said, right wele hope I (þat it) be þe spirit of Gy; (&amp; in) þat chamber moste es he (whar) mi lord was won to be, (&amp; in) þat bed will he noght blin (þat) mi lord and I lay in”. (and þan) scho said with simpel chere: “ r I namore cum nere, ?e me cownsaile (what best) might in þis case auaile”. (When þe prior) had herd þis case, in his hert he mase, noght be affrayde, (þu)s he sayde: (dr)ede þe noght, þe boght. in þi minde g mankinde clerkes werkes , and wele I hope ordain sum point profe and schew omang his seruandes dere to þaire helping als men sal here; and þarfore, dame, gif þe noght ill, bot be right blith, and hald þe still. vnto my breþer I will a space to ask þaire counsail in þis case; for omang many witty men sum gude kounsayl may men ken, and sekerer may it so be tane þan of a man by him allane. þarfor, he said, dame, hald þe here, and vnto god mak þi praiere; for lang sall I noght fra þe dwell”. Þan gert he ring þe chapetil bell to geder þe couent al togeder; and hastily when þai come þeder, he declared þam al þis case als þe woman said it wase, and praied þam forto tell him to þarof what þam thoght best to do. Þan ilka man sais his avise and laytes whare moste medcin lise; and graythly þan with gude entent þai ordaynd by þaire aller assent þat þe Pryor sone suld ga, and with him oþer maisters twa, þe tone maister of geomettri(!) and þe toþer of philisophi, samen sold þai wende al thre vnto þe mayre of þat cete and tell þis same tale him vntill, and pray him, if it war his will, þat he wald vouche-safe forto send sum sertain men with þam to wend to Gy hows þat was newli ded, to se þa wonders in þat stede and to bere witnes of þaire dede, and to mayntene þam, if it war nede. and þus þai did with al þaire maine; þe woman was þareof ful fayne. Sune when þe maire had herd þis thing, twa hundreth men he bad forth bring, and armed þam fra top to ta, and bad þam with þe Prior ga and baldely do what he wald bid. and als he demid right so þai did. (Þe prior þan bad þam al) bidene þat þai sulde be schreuen clene and here mes with deuocioune, and seþen baldli mak þam boune. And of Requiem he sang a mes— for cristen saules it ordand es; and þarin made minde of Gy and prayed for him ful specialli, and þat god suld gif þam grace forto haue knawing in þat case; and efter mes þan wald howseld he al þe men þat wald howseld be, for þat þe fende suld þam noght fere ne in þaire dedes do þam no dere. Þe prior þan ful preuely in a buste toke goddes body vnder his gere with gude entent— bot no man wist þat with him went. He and þe men and þe maisters twa to Gies hows þan gan þai ga, and þe wife went with þam in-fere, sighand with ful simpil chere. Þe armed men þan ordand he al obout þe hows to be wele vmset on ilka side, to se what auentures wald bitide, sum in window, and sum in dore, with wapins þat war strang &amp; store, and sum in gardines gert he lig, &amp; sum in bretice obout þe rig; and euer in ilka place thre, in takining of þe trinite. and when þai war þus sett obout, þe prior bad þam haue no dout. He enterd þan in þat place, and his twa breþer with him gase, and þir wordes þan he saide in hi: Pax sit huic domui, þat es in inglis þus to say: “pese be to þis hows alway”. to chamber he went with-outen rest, and haliwater obout he kest, with vidi aquam; þan said he þus: Veni creator spiritus, with þe colet þat sal efter cum: Deus qui corda fidelium, askand help of þe haly gaste al wikkednes oway to waste; (hali)water eftsones kest he and said asperges me domine. Þan cald he þe wife with-outen mare, and sho com wepeand wonder sare; he said: “dame, teche me to þe stede and to bed ware Gy was dede”. Þe woman was ful mased and mad, scho trembild þan so was scho rad, for care hir hert bigan to calde; bot to þe bed sone scho him talde; and in hir wa so als scho was, scho said: “Sir prior, or ?e pas I prai ?ow for mending of me and als in dede of charite þat ?e wald bid sum hali bede and mak ?owre prayers in þis stede for his saul þat was husband here”; and when scho had said on þis manere, down scho fell als scho wald dy, opon a noþer bed þar-bi, for dole and wa scho wex al wan. and þan þe prior þus bigan and said: dominus vobiscum, his breþer answerd all and sum; And efter þan he said onone þe first godspell of saint Ione, In principio clerkes it call; when þat was said, þan sat þai all opon a burd þe bed biside, and said þe seruise in þat tyde þat for þe ded aw for to be, Placebo with þe dirige; and efter laudes þai said in hi seuen spalmes with þe letany. and agnus dei when þai said (thrise), þai herd ane answer on þis (wise), a febill voyce þare might (þai ken) als of a childe, saiand amen. þarfore þai war all ful a(ffrayd). and þan þe prior þusga(te said): “I coniore þe, þou creat(ure), in þe vertu of oure (saueure), þat es a god of mig(htes mast), fader and sun and h(ali gast), þat was and es þat þou me ans(wer) and tell me als fer als ” (It answe)rd hym on þis manere: “(Syr) prior, aske sune what þou will, and I sal tell it þe vntill als fer als I haue might or minde or als I may haue leue by kinde”. Þis ilk voice þan herd þai all þe armed men obout þe hall, and in þai come ful fast rinand, ilkone with wapin in þaire hand, for wele it was in þaire trowing þat þai suld se sum gastely thing. bot neuer-þe-lese þare saw þai nane ne noght herd bot a voyce allane. Þe prior bad þai suld stand still, &amp; þus he spak þe voyce vntill: “Whether ertou ane ill gaste or a gude?” Þe voyce answerd with eger mode and said: “Sir, I am a gude gaste; þat may I proue þe here in haste. for hali writ þus beres wittnes: when god had made both more &amp; les, (he luk)ed his werkes in ilka wane (and) þai war wonder gude ilkane.

Gy: ” le by iugement and for euil dedis þat þai did here; bot neuer-þe-les þe pain es ill to þam þat it es gifen vntill. so es mine ill to me allane, for me it pines and oþer nane. and sen I haue swilk euyl payne for mi sins, als es sertayne, ane euill spirite men may cal me, vntill time þat I clensed be of euil þat I haue done”. Þan al þus said þe prior sone: “Tell vs apertly, or þou pas, whilk mans spirite þat þou was”. Þe voice answerd to him in hy and said: “I am [þe] spirit of Gy, þe whilk ?e wate was newly dede and was husband here in þis stede”. Þe prior said: “Þan wele I finde by reson þat þou ert vnkinde, þat þou makes slike sclander &amp; strife vnto Gies bodi and to his wife. for ay whils Gy was lifand man, ful rightwis was he halden þan and trew in faith, of nobill fame, and his wif was halden þe same; and for þir meruailes þat þou mase now will men say in ilka place þat Gy was man of wikked life and þarfore turmentes he his wife; for laud folk in ilka land sais euyll men er oft walkand. and Gy was halden gude alway, wharfore þou ert vnkind, I say”. Þe voice answerd þan als him thoght and said: “vnkinde ne am I noght nowþer to mi wif ne to my bodi. enchesun sal I say þe why, by sause þat þou sal noght forsake, for swilk a scill here I þe make. if þou had gifen a man to were kote or hode or oþer gere, and he þat so þi cote had tane wald suffer for þi luf allane in gude and ill to lif and dy, war he noght kinde to þe forþi?” Þe prior said: “?is, for sertayne”. and þan answerd þe voyce ogayne &amp; said: “(right so bi me bifell). here in þis erth wils I gan dewell, of Gy I toke none oþer thing bot his cors vnto my clething; and þat cors þat I dedli call, gert vs both in folies fall, and for þe wikkednes þat it wroght am I in all þir bales broght, and his doing was ilkadele; als haly writ witnes ful wele and sais þat liking here of fless contrari vnto þe saule es. and if I sufferd noght þis payne, Gyes bodi and als his saul sertaine sul suffer paine with-outen ende in fire of hell with mani a fende. For ilka man both more and myn sall suffer penance for þaire syn ouþer in þis erth whare þai dwell, or els in purgari, or in hell; and ilka man might better here suffer pain thurgh seuen ?ere als mekill als ani man suffer may, þan in purgatori a day; and a day here to suffer care may of a ?ere relese him þare. Gyes bodi has now no skathe and I am pined to saue vs bathe; and efter when we cum to blis, what ioy so I haue sall be his, for bath togeder sall be þan bodi and saul of ilka man. and sen I haue þir paines grim noght anly for me bot for him, till he of all filthes be finde, þan am I noght [to] him vnkinde. And, sir Prior, also þou sais þat I of Gy suld sclander rais. þat will I answer on þis wise and say þat I ger no sclander rise. for þat es sklander kindely kend þat sownes in ill or has ill end; wha so it dose mun dere aby, for haly writ sais weterly Vnto þat man sall wa be wroght thurgh wham sclander first vp es broght. and all if answer þus for Gy I do to him no vilany. my spekeing es all for his spede þat I haue neuynd to ?ow his nede, and als my speche may gretly gayn till oþer saules þat suffers payn. and þat may þou þi-seluen se: for mani folk of þis cete cums to þis hows ful hastily, and ilkone pray þai fast for Gy þat god deliuer him out of care, als þou and þi breþer did are; and in þaire praiers þat þai say, for al cristen saules þai prai, and þe prayers þat men makes for ane may help to oþer saules ilkane. And also þai þat er on liue sall suner of þaire sins þam schriue and gif þam vnto penance hard, þat þai be noght pined efterward als I am pined now for my plight þat Gy amended noght whils he might. I say I sklander noght forþi nowþer Gyes wife ne his body, bot all þir sauwes þat I say now er for þaire honore and for þaire prow”. Þe Prior said: “þan ask I þe how any man may euill be when he es ded, sen þat he was schreuen clene or he gan pas, and was in will gude werkes to wirk and ended in trowth of haly kirk and had his sacramentes ilkane?” Þe voice answerd sone onane and said: “þat men may euyl be on two maners, þat proue I þe, when þai er ded and heþin gane. þat may on þis maner be tane: for þai er ill whare so þai wend, þat dampned er, with-owten end; and þai er euill for sertayn (space) þat suffers pains in any p(lace) for þaire sins, þat es to sai till tyme þat it be wasted (owai). þis same right in mi for I was schreuen ?it am I euill, þis es till I haue sufferd For als men clerkes sais here syn was. (þar)fore fully it suffices noght forto be schreuen in will and thoght, bot if men may in dede fulfill þe penance þat es gifen þam till; for þat þai do noght or þai dy, sall fulfillde be in porgatory; and a day þare to suffer paine semes als a ?ere here for sertayne. þarfore es gude þat men þam schriue, and suffer penance in þaire liue”. Þe Prior þan of him gan craue if þat he wist oght wha war saue or whilk men war dampned bidene, in þe stedes whare he had bene. Þe voyce answerd sone þartill and sayd: “it es noght goddes will þat I suld swilk thinges ascri; I will þe say encheson why. all þat in purgatori er dwelland to blis of heuin er þai ordand, þarfore þam au nothing to say bot þat þai may warand alway. and þe soth of þis may no man tell bot he had bene in heuyn and in hell and sene what sorow es in þe tane, and ioy in þe toþer þat neuer bese gane; (þu)s in þam bath wha so had bene, (might) say þe soth als he had sene. (and) sen I am þe gaste of Gy (and) suffers pain in purgatori, (pain)es in hell may I noght se— (I was) neuer þare ne neuer sal be; (and to he)uin may I noght win (till I be clen)sed clene of sin; (þarfor þe) soth may I noght say (wha sal be saue)d or damned for ay”. (Þe prior sai)d: “þou ert noght stabill, (bot a spirit) fals and desayueabill, noght here, þis manere. kes k[n]awe in þe ald lawe resowne oune (incar))nacioune, in Mari þe mayden milde of mode; and als þai talde in mani a stede how he in erth suld suffer dede, and of his rising talde þai right: and ?it þai saw him neuer in sight. And sen þai war men bodily and said slike thinges thurgh prophecy and kend þe folk how þai might knaw swilk thing als þai neuer saw, of more force þan thinkes me a clene spirit, als þou suld be, sold haue more might swilk thinges to tell þan þai þat lifed in fless and fell; and þan aght þe to wit by þis whilk er in bale and whilk in blis”. Þe voyce answerd to him in haste and said: “forsoth þir wordes er wast; I may wele proue þe in þis place, it es no liknes þat þou mase by-twix prophetes þat standes in stori, and saules þat er in purgatori. Þe prophettes had, whils þai wond here, of god and of his angels clere and of gift of þe haly gaste al þaire maters leste and maste þat þai might tell and preche ouerall byfore als it sold efter fall; swilk grete grace was gifen þam till, and all was for þis sertayn scill: for laud folk in ilka land by þaire steuyns might vnderstand and better trow how Criste was born, by saus þat þai had said biforn; for sen þaire saus fra god war sent, men sal þam trow with gude entent. And I am set for sertaine space, to time þat god will grante me grace, þus for my sins to suffer paine, and, sir, I say þe for sertayne þat I may now none angels se bot þam þat has kepeing of me, and to me will þai tell right noght till I out of mi paines be broght. Þarfor I may noght say sertaine whilk er in ioy or wlik in payne”. Þan said þe Prior sone onane: “right in þi saus þou sall be tane. (þou) sais no spi(rit mai sai to) me whilk saules sal saued or dampned be; and bukes beres witnes, be balde, þat fendes sum tyme to men has talde and said þe soth haly bydene of þam þat saued or dampned has bene”. Þe voice answ[e]rd and said ogayne þat no spirite þat dwelles in paine ne none of fendes þat er in hell may haue no power forto tell ne any thing to man at neuyn þat toches to preuetes of heuyn, bot it [be] thurgh goddes sufrance, or oþer angels þam tell thurgh chance; and vnto me þai tell no thing, þarfore I may noght haue knawyng of heuinly blis how it es þare; ne in hell how þe fendes fare. bot saules þat þare sall suffer pyne, þaire penance es wele more þan mine; for I haue hope to cum till blis, and þareof sall þai euer mis. þarfore es no liknes to tell bitwix me and þe paines of hell”. Þan said þe Prior: “I pray þe now, tell me in what stede ertou”. Þe voice answerd and sayd in hy: “I am here in purgatori”. Þan said þe Prior: “proued þou hase þat purgari es in þis place; for if þat þou be pyned here þan may so oþer saules in fere; and þare whare saules be purged sall, purgatori men may þare call. þarfore by þir saues þat þou sais purgatori es þare always”. Þan said þe voice on þis manere: “Sir, þare er purgatories sere: Ane es comun to more and les, and departabill anoþer es”. Þe prior said: “now se I wele þat þou ert fals in ilkadele. a saul may noght in a time ga forto be pyned in places twa, for whils he sall be in þe tane, of þe toþer he may haue nane. In a stede bihoues him suffer paine”. Þan said þe voice: “þis es sertayne. I am now (pined, þis) es na fabill, in purgatory departabill ilka day, als god vowches saue; bot oþer paynes byhoues me haue, for ilka night bihoues me in comun purgatory pined be, forto suffer paynes sare with oþer sawles þat dwelles þare”. Þe pryor sayd þan: “can þou ges in what stede comun purgatory es whare paine es [to] saules puruaide?” Þe spirite answerd þan and said: “in middes of al þe erth ful right es comun purgatori dyght, and þare es pain ordand for vs”. And þe Prior answerd þus: he said, “me think bi alkins ways it may noght be suth þat þou says. þe middes of erth es a sertaine space, and þe purgatori a noþer place, and twa stedes may noght be in ane. þarfore me think þou has mistane; if purgatori whare sawles dwelles war in middes erth als þou telles, twa stedes in ane þan bud be þare, and þat saltou se neuermare. þarfore so es it noght arrayd”. Þe voyce þan answerd sune and said þat places er ordand ful rathe bodily and gastly bathe. “a saul es gastly, and forþi it ocupies no stede bodily, þat es to say by it allane, when mans bodi þarfro es tane. þis ilk how[s] als þou may se haldes both þi saul and þe, and ?it here er noght stede(s twa). and hereby may þou se als(wa) how haile and raine &amp; sle(t &amp; snaw) er in þe ayre klerely to (knaw), and ilkone has his cours so es þat place whare ” Þe Prior said: “tell vs (now mare) whi þat þou ert pin(ed þare) more þan in anoþer (stede), sen þe tyme (þat þou was dede)”. Þe voice answ(erd : “for in þis I gan me (&amp; made no) penance in mi liue; þarfore here sall I penance haue for þat sin till I be saue”. Þe Prior said: “now, if þou can, tell vs what thing moste noyes man, wit paynes of ded when he es tane”. Þe voice answerd and said onane þat vgly sightes sall moste him dere of foule fendes þat him sal fere; “ful many sall obout him be defigured all in foule degre, and grisly sall þai grin &amp; gnaiste, out of þaire wit þam forto wrayste, and als byfor him sall be broght al wikkednes þat euer he wroght; so will þai fande with any gin thurgh wanhope if þai might him win”. Þe prior sayd: “þat wald I frayne what remedy war þare-ogayne and thing þat might help men maste in (band)es of ded when þai er braste”. (Þe) vo[i]ce sayd: “þare es sum man (þat) may hope for no helping þan: (for) if a man lede all his lyue (in) sin and seþin wil him noght schriue (and in) his hert will haue no care (for) ill dedes he has done are, (þan s)all his angell to him tell (how Cr)iste for him had paines fell (and ho)w he died for his byhoue, (bot þat) sall be to his reproue; (&amp; sai als) how he was vnkinde (vnto god) whils he had minde (and als þa)t he was mys-avised (þe sacra)mentes when he despised (&amp; wald noght) schriue him of his sin and ended þarin. (when his wer)kes er thusgat sayd, (þe fendes sall) obout him braid (and him take) with all þaire might (and sai to him): ‘þou weried wight, (cum with vs now in) to hell, (þare withowten ende) to dwell’. (Bot if a man be schreuen) clene bydene ilkane (g)ane, all-if his penance be noght done his gude angell says to him (sone): ‘cumfort þe wele, I sall þe were þat þe deuils sall þe noght dere’; and vnto þe fendes þan sal he say: ‘?e weried wightes, wendes oway, for ?e haue no part in þis man’. and þe fendes sall answer þan and say on þis wise: ‘oures he es by resun and by rightwisnes’, and þarto sall þai schew full sone all euell dedes þat he has done both in eld and als in ?owth, sen first he kind[l]y wittes kowth, and say: ‘he sinned þus and þus, þarfore him aw to wend with vs’. His gude angell will mak debate and say: ‘he sined, wele I wate, all on þis wise als ?e haue talde; bot he es borowed, be ?e balde, for with schrift was he clensed clene and toke his sacramentes bidene, and he had sorow for his sinyng; to clensing fire þat sal him bring, and þe merit of Cristes passion now sal [be mene] bitwyx him and ?ow and serue him both for sheld and spere, þat ?owre desaytes sal him noght dere. and Cristes hend and als his side, þat thirled war with wowndes wide, sal be bitwix him and ?owre hend and fro ?owre felnes him defend; and Cristes face þat buffet was, bitwix him and ?owre face sal pas, so þat he sall, if he ?ow se, for ?owre boste noght abaist be; Al Cristes bodi spred on rode sal be vnto him armure gude, so þat ?e sall haue no powere him forto dere on no manere; and þe lims of Ihesu fre þat for mankind was pined on tre, sall clens him now of his foly he did whith lyms of his body; þe saul of Crist, als we wele ken, þat ?olden was for erthly men, sall purge him now of all þe plight þat þis saule did with his awin myght. so þat in him (sal leue no gilt) (whar)fore he (suld) with . . (be) spilt, ne no pain vnto him sall stand bot purgatori þat (es) passand; he sall be purged in þat place and suffer pain a sertayne space, and seþin with vs sall he wende and won in welth with-owten ende’. Þus sall þe gude angell help him ogaynes þe deuils griseli and grim, and þus es Cristes passioune set bifor vs redy boune forto defend vs fra þe fende out of þis werld when we sall wende. and þarfore aw ilk man bi kinde to haue þat passioun most in minde, and namely in þe tyme of dede, for þan it standes man moste in stede. Also men sall haue helping gude of Mari mayden mild of mode; if we here oght for hir haue done, baldeli may we ask hyr bone and vs to help scho will hir haste in ded when oure mister es maste. For if a man, or he hethen fare, be schreuen clene, als I said are, oure lady þan will be ful boune to socore him in þat sesoune, and fend him fro þe fendes in fere, and say to [þam] on þis manere: ‘Moder and mayden both am I of Ihesu mi sun, god almighty, and of heuyn am I coronde quene, and lady of all erth bydene, and I am emperise of hell, whare ?e and oþer deuils dwell. And sen þat I am quene of heuyn, vnto my sun þus sall I neuyn þat he sall wine for luf of me þis saul in purgatori to be till he be clensed clene of sin, and so to heuyn I sall him win; he serued me in word and dede, in heuyn sall he haue his mede. And also sen I am lady of all þe erth, þarfore [will] I, thurgh þe will of my sun dere, þat ilk gude dede and ilk prayere (þat owhar in þis) werlde er (said), vnto his profet be puruayd, messes and oþer almus-dede sall turn þis man to mekel mede, and thurgh þe merite of þe mes sal his penance be made les þat him es ordand for his syn, whilk ?owre falshede gert him fal in. And sen I am emperyce of hell, þarfore ?owre force now sall I fell: I cumand ?ow ?e heþin fare, so þat ?e noy þis man nomare þat es ded in my suns seruyse’. And when scho has said on þis wise, all þe halows in heuyn on hight will help hir halely with þaire might; to Ihesu will þai call in-fere, and þus þai will mak þaire prayere: ‘Lord Ihesu god almighty, fader of heuyn, man of mercy, haue mercy on þis man þat es oure awin broþer and oure liknes; sen þou wald wend fro heuyn on hight and suffer payn for mans plight, þou meng þi mercy with þis man’. Þus sal his saul be saued þan, and his gude angell sall him take to clensing fire aseth to make and vnto him he sall take tent till he haue sufferd his turment; and þan þe weked gastes sall ga þeþin oway with mekill wa. In þis manere may gude pr(ayere) and almus-dedes þat men dose (here), and merit of Cristes pascioun, and of halows gude orisown, help a man here in his (dede) and vnto clensing fire (him lede)”. Þe prior (sayd vnto) him (þan) and asked if þat any (man) of Ihesu may haue (in ded a sight) and of Mari his moder (bright) or of þe halows in þaire right (forme) Þe voice ans(werd and said nay); “bot on þis wise if any be so þat has may se þam (bot sin)ful men may noght þam se”. (Þe) prior sayd: “þan thinkes me (þat) þou sais now þi-self to scorne (ogai)nes þe saws þou said biforne; (for) þou said angels suld be boune þare to reherce Cristes pascioune, and þou said Mari suld be þare and oþer halows les and mare in sight bifor þe saules ful euyn, praiand for þam to god of heuyn; þan semes it þat he se þam may”. Þe voice answerd and said: “nay; þai sal be þare I grante þe wele, bot he sall se of þam no dele in þaire lyknes verrayli; and þis es þe enchesoun whi. for þe most blis in heuyn it es forto se Crist in his liknes, þat es to say in his godhede; (þa)n neded saules none oþer mede (bo)t in þaire dying him to se, and in þat blis þan solde þai be (sod)ainly in þaire passing, (and) þat war vn(ak)ordand thing (þat sin)ful men suld se þat sight. (if men) be puried of all þaire plight þan sall þai se god als he es, (hali) writ so beris witnes”. (And þan) þe prior frained him fast (if spirit)es þat es heþin past (wist) what dedes er for þam done (on þis) molde at morn or none, (and þe) praiers men for þam ma. (Þe voice) answerd and said: ?a. se wele by þis thing es has saules helping. (Þe prior said: “þan) can þou say (wharof I sang) mess to-day?” (Þe voice answerd) þarto ful tite: (“þou sang mess) of saint spirite”. (Þe prior said þan) als he knew: “ noght trew, (for I sang mess, þis) es sertayne, (for cristen saules þat) suffers paine; (þarfore þou sais noght) suthfastly”. (Þe voice þan answerd him) in hy and said: (“I wat wele) for cristen (saules þat) þou sang; bot ?it I (said soth) neuer-þe-les þat of saint spirite was þi mes. þat saltou by ensameple se. for wele þou knawes in ilk cuntre, if ani man oþer alde or ?ing of a noþer suld ask a thing, and he hoped wele forto haue þat ilk thing þat he walde craue, first to ask he walde him haste þe thing þat might amend him mast, and what so his hert lai moste nere þat suld first in his speche apere and first be in his wordes alwayse, als god þus in his gospell sayse: Ex habundancia cordis os loquitur: Of þe fulnes of þe hert spekes þe mowth þe wordes smert. and messes sungen of saint spirite vnto me er most profite, and next þan of þe trinite— þir messes moste amendes me. and here now þe encheson whi. for whils I lifed here bodily, I spended my wit and mi powere ful oft-siþes in sinnes sere, when I sold þam haue spended right to goddes honour with al mi might. Þe fader I suld haue mensked with main, for of him cumes al power plaine þat men has here ai whils þai lif, efter his grace als he will gif; þarfore what man so dose vnright bi his power or by his might or by his strenkith if þat it be, ogaines þe fader of heuyn sins he, for al power he weldes always, als Dauid in þe sauter sais: Omnia quecunque uoluit dominus fecit, he sais: þe fader mai fulfill in heuyn and erth what so he will. To Crist, god sun, es gifen ful right wit and wisdom dai &amp; night, to mesure it till erthli men, als þir clerkes mai clereli ken; þarfore godes sun þai sin ogain þat here despendes þaire wittes in vain (and) settes þam so (on erthly) gude (þat) reches es more in þaire mode þan Crist god sun þat boght þam dere. and my-self on þis same manere sined in þis werld whare ?e won both ogaines þe fader &amp; þe sun. To þe haligast es gifen al grace and beaute plain in ilka place, at his liking to dele and dight in þis werld to ilka wight; ogaines him oft-siþes sinned I when þat I vsed in foul foly swilk giftes als he me gaf bi kinde, and honord him noght in mi minde; for mi fauore and my fairehede haue I done many sinful dede, and vertus haue I turned to vice thurgh wekid werkes als wreche vnwise. wharfore aseth byhoues me make to thre persons for my sin sake; þarfore messes of þe trinite er mekill medeful vnto me for greuance þat to me es graide, als my gude angell has me saide. Bot for þat I haue sined maste ogaynes þe giftes of þe hali gaste, couaytand here more reches þan he me gaf of his gudenes or þan he vowched safe me to send, and wrangwisli his gudes despend and honord him noght for þaire sake, þarefore, of þis amendes to make, messes sungen of saint spirite may tittest saue me out of site. and þarfore, sir, sothli I say of saint spirite þou sang to-day; al-if þine office ordand ware for cristen saules als þou said are, þou toke with gude deuocioune of saint spirite ane orisoune, and þat ilk orisoun sertaine aleged me more of my paine þan al þe oþer þat þou sayd, for till all saules war þai puruaid; And sen þat helpid me allane more þan all þe oþer ilkane, of saint spirit I say þou sang— if þou me wites þou has þe wrang”. (Þe prior asked) þan þ(is thing): for how mani saules a prest may s(ing) in a tyme and in a stede, wheþer it be for quik or ded, and ilkone haue in lyke gudenes and in like merite of þat mes. Þe voice answerd and gan say þat a preste anely on a day for all saules may sing and rede and ilkone of his mes haue mede, thurgh vertu of þe sacrament; “þat proue I þe, if þou tak tent. Ihesus Crist with Iewes uoice was anes offerd on þe croyce, and þare he died and gaf þe gaste vntill his fader of mightes maste for saluacioune of all man-kin, and noght anly for a man sin: right so þe preste in ilka mes offers Criste right als he es in hale godhede, als clerkes mai ken, in mendment of all cristen men; and so in a mes may be tane al cristen saules als wele als ane, and plainli mai (it) part þam till. þat proue I þe bi proper skill. Ful grete deference may men fele bitwene spiritual thing and tem(porele); for temporal thing, þat þou sese here, if it be parted in places sere, in þe ma partyes þat it es it-self leues ay wele þe (les), þat es for porcion partes þarfra; als if þat þou an appell ta and parte it into many hend, with þi-self sall litell lend. On þe toþer side þou vnder(stand) þat spiritual thing es ay (wexand); þarto I may gude liknes (ma): þis orisoune if þat þ(ou ta), þe pater noster, and (teche it þen) here on þis molde to (mani men), when it vnto all te(ched es), in itself it es noght (þe les), bot to knawing when mo it (sais þan ane or twa). so er messes þat ordand it es in þat degre wham so it ordand es, (þaire) merit may noght be þe les, (b)ot mare ioy sall þai haue þat tide þat oþer er helped þam biside”. On þis wise þan þe prior sais: “haly writ wittnes always þat saules er helpid for sertaine and oft deliuerd out of payne thurgh speciall praier and special dede þat frendes dose here for þaire mede, and þa frendes dose þa dedes allane for a saul and for oþer nane. (þan þi)nk me þat his mede sall fall þan it war done for all and more alege him of his payne”. Þe voice answerd and said ogayne þat all þe prestes þat messes singes nedes forto do twa thinges: (f)irst his praiers forto make specialli for þat saul sake þat he es most halden vntill, (þ)at god deliuer him of all ill; (and) when he has so praied for ane, (þan) sall he pray for oþer ilkane. (so) ilkane has mede of þat mes, (and) þai for wham it ordand es (er he)lpid maste fro bale þarby. (And on) þis same maner am I (deliuerd) of mi penance here lasted bi foure ?ere (m)isdedes als it was det. frende here has it sett þat þou wele knew þat I find trew; when he had nede þe scoles ?ede d most mister here fiue ?ere. wele I wroght forgetes he noght has me maste in haste passe payne, and if þou here no(ght) þan of me sothly sertayne may þou be þat I in (blis) of heuen am stad”.— Þe prior did right als he bad, at þe pase efter he him soght: bot of þe voice he herd right noght; þarfore in heuyn he hopid he ware.— bot in þat time ?it asked he mare. He said: “can þou oght trewli tell if þou in þat ilk heuyn sal dwell þat for goddes halows es puruaid?” Þe voice answerd sune and sayd: “Sir, I tald þe are ful euyn þat I come neuer ?it in heuyn, þarfore I may tell þe nomare of thinges þat er ordaind þare. Bot of þat blis I mai be balde, for þus myne angell has me talde, þat I to passe in paine sold be and þan, he said, þat I sall se þe king of heuyn in his godhede with his angels all on brede and with his halows euerilk-ane. and I answerd to him onane and said: ‘lord, ful lang think me þat semely sight vntill I se’. bot he be loued in ilka place þat vnto me has gifen swilk grace, for trewly mai I trow by þis þat I sall be in þat ilk blis whare god and his angels sal be, sen þat I sall þam þusgat se”. Þan said þe prior: “what helpes maste a saul vp into heuyn at haste out of þe paynes of purgatori?” Þe voice answerd to him in hy: “messes may moste help þam þen þat here er said of hali men, and ordand of milde Mari fre”. Þe prior said: “þan thinkes me þe office þat es for saules sertain, of Requiem, was made in vayn, sen oþer helpes þam more þan it”. Þe voice answerd vnto him ?it and said: “þat office es gude to say when a man for al saules will pray þat saued sall be efter þaire paine; þan may þat office gretely gaine. and for þat laud men here in land can noght graythli vnderstand þat saules has mede of oþer mes, þarfore þat office ordand es”. Þe prior said: “sen þou has kend þat speciall messes may moste amend: whilk oþer praiers withowten þa may tittest saules fro penance ta?” Þe voyce sayd þan: “Syr, sertaynly, seuyn psalmes with þe letany”. Þe prior said: “þat war noght right; þe pater noster es more of might, for it was made of Criste god sun vntill all crysten folk to kun, als prise of praiers, als men telles, and þe Aue made angels vnto Mari for manes mede, and XII. apostels made þe crede; and þe seuyn psalmes er erthli werkes, ordand of bisshopes and oþer clerkes men for to say for sin allane, and Dauid made þam euerilkane; and nowþer Dauid, wele we ken, ne bisshoppes, ne none oþer men, vnto Criste þai [er] noght at neuyn ne ?it vnto angels of heuyn ne till apostels er þai noght pere. þarfore me think þat þaire prayere may noght of swilk merit be als þe pater noster and þe Aue, ne als þe Crede, for þam it wroght”. Þe voice answerd þan als him thoght: “Þir praiers er ful mekill of mede and ful hali, if we tak hede, in þam-self, þis es sertayne, and þaire makers er mekill of mayne; men sal þam honore als worthy es bifore al oþer, out-tane þe mes.

Sone þan þe prior him assailes: “tell me, he said, what it availes or if saules oght þe better be to pray placebo and þe dirige, with office þat for þe ded es dight?” Þe voyce answerd and said on hight— with grete force out gan he bryst, and said: “a, prior, and þou wist how gretely þat it may þam gayne, þan hope I þou wald be ful fayne oft forto bid þat blisced bede for þi frendes hat heþen er dede! and for þou sall it better knawe, I sall þe rekin right on rawe þe preuetese þat falles þarto and what prophit þat it may do.

Þe twa antyms þat er puruaid with þir psalmes forto be sayd, may be cald þe gude cumpany of angels on þe to party, and of halows on þe toþer side, whare þe saules in blis sal bide.

Þarfore, sir prior, þir prayers helpes saules þus als þou heres”. When he had þus declared þis thing, all þat it herd had grete liking and meri made þai ilka man. bot þan þe gaste ful sone bigan to morn and mak ful simpil chere, and said to þam on þis manere: “askes hastily what so ?e will, my time es fast cumand me till þat me bus gang, als es mi grace, to suffer paynes in oþer place”. Þe prior said: “sen þou sais swa þat þe bus till slike greuance ga: þis wald I wit now, or þou wend, if we might oght to þe amend”. With simpill voice þan answerd he and said: “if ?e wald say for me fyue sithes right specialli þe fiue ioyes of oure lady, þat might help mekil me vntill”. Þai granted him with ful gude will, and on þaire knese þai set þam doune and said with gude deuocioune Gaude uirgo mater Christi, with fiue verses folowand fully, bowsomly als he þam bad. and þarof was þe gaste ful glad, and said: “wele haue ?e . . ., my pain es sumdele pasand now, þat I may better speke with ?ow”. Þan said þe prior: “can þou oght tell what deres moste þe deuill of hell?” Þe voice answerd and said in hy: “þe sacrament of goddes body; for in what stede goddes bodi ware, and þe fendes of hell war þare, vnto it bud þam do honowre; and so sall ilka creatoure”. Þe prior said: “þan thinkes me þat al spirites suld it se when it es on þe auter grayd”. Þe voice answerd sone and said: þat all gude spirites may it ken more verraily þan erthly men. Þe prior asked þan þis skill: if deuils might do ani dere þartill or destourb it by ani way. Þe voice answerd and said: “nay, bot if þat þe preste be vnclene, in dedly sin þat es to mene or oþer sins if þat it be; in swilk prestes has þe fende powste forto mer þam in þaire mes, if þai won in þaire wikkednes. And ?it he cums noght comunly to ger þam be abaiste þarby, bot when he wate þat þai lif wrang þe ofter wald he þat þai sang, and þat es to encrese þaire paine— for of þaire ill fare es he fayne”. Þe prior asked withowten lett if þare war any angell sett to ?eme þe auter fra euyl thing whils goddes bodi es in offering, and þe preste in þat tyme to wis. Þe voice answerd and said: “?is; if gude angels war noght present, with euyl spirites might al be shent, for þai wald sone desturb þe preste and put vain thoghtes into his breste, so þat he suld noght worthily haue might forto mak goddes body with honore als it aw to be, so suld he think on vanite”. (Þe prior þan bigan to frain) what remedy war þare(-ogayn), forto defend þe fendes fell. Þan said þe voice: “I sall þe tell. If þat þe preste in goddes presens be clene in his awin conciens, and mak his praiers with clene thoght, þan þe deuils may dere him noght”. Þan þe prior said þir saus: “es þare no prayer þat þou knaws a preste to say bifor he sing, þat might fordo swilk euil thing?” Þan said þe voice: “sir, he þat hade þe praier þat saint Austin made þe whilk Summe sacerdos es (tald), and he with gude deuocioune (wald) say it ilkday or he sang, to mes þan might he baldli gang; fro wathes it will so wele him were, vnnethes suld any thing him dere”. Þe prior fraynde him þan ful right if he saw euer þat solempne sight, of goddes bodi þe sacrament, out of þis werld sen þat he went. Þe voyce said: “sir, I se it ?it: for on þi breste þou beres it, in a box þou has it broght, als it was on þe auter wroght”. Þan al þe folk awonderd ware, for of þat thing wist þai no(ght are) þat þe prior had goddes body, bot resayued in his mes anely. Þe prior said: “þan wald I wit whi þat þou noght honord (it), sen þou sais þat ilk a creat(ure) to goddes body sall do hon(oure), and þou wate wele þat (it es here)”. Þe voice answerd on þis (manere): “I haue it honord in my (kinde) with all mi might (and all my minde) sen first þat þou it (hider broght), (al-if) þat þou parsa(iued it noght)”. Þe prior þan with (gude entent) toke þat solemp(ne sacrament) out of his clath (þar it was hid), and to þe (spirit þus gan he bid): “If þou trow (þe soth þarbi) þat þis (es goddis awin bodi), to bow it es of swilk pouste, (in uer)tu þareof I cumand þe (þat þou) wend with me a plain pase (to þe) vterest end of all þis place”. (Þan said) þe voice: “sir, I am boune, (bot noght) to folow þi persoune, bot with mi lord fain will I wend þat þou haldes bitwix þi hend”. Sune þan þe prior toke þe gate fast toward þe vtterest ?ate; with him went his breþer twa, and so did ful many ma. of þe spirite he saw right noght; bot in his hereing wele him thoght þat a noyce efter him come like a besom made of brome þat war swepeand on a pament; swilk a noyse ay with þam went. and þarto said þe prior þus: “Þou spirit, shew þe vntill vs (als cle)rly als þou ert wroght”. Þareto þe voice answerd right noght. (Þe) prior þan ogain gan pas (vnti)ll þe wedow whare sho was (liggand) seke sare on a bed, (&amp; had) sho lang bene euill sted; (þe no)yes folowd als it did are. (and whan þai) in þe chamber ware bigin, (þe woman bigan) to gnayst and grin (and for) to cri als sho war wode, (þat al war) stonaid þat þare stode, þai had þat sight to se was grete pete. (Þe pople þan) with al þaire might se þat sight, vnto þat place (þa)t wonder case. (lik) vnto lede sho war ded. are come þare, stode he still till “ (pa)scioune ne þat þi w(if mas slike) murnig”. Þan sayd þe voyce ful sarili: “sho wate þe cause als wele als I”. Þe prior þan in þaire present sone to þe woman he went and vnto hir þus gan he say: “In þe name of god, dame, I þe pray tel vnto me al þi thoght”. sho lay ful still and answerd noght. So still obout þe bed þai stode, to luke if oght might mend hir mode, and for hir wa fast gan þai wepe. Sone efter sho bigan to crepe vpon hir knese so als sho may, and cried loud and þus gan say: “Ihesu mi lord, als þou boght me, of my paynes þou haue pete, and grante me of þi help in haste to bete þis bale þat me has braste”. Þe prior saw hir sorow and site and to þe voice þus said he tite: “Whi es þi wife þus trauailed here?” Þe uoice answerd on þis manere: “I talde right now here þe vntill þat hir-self wate for what scill, and if þou will wit more alway, ask hir-self, sho kan þe say”. Þan eft þe prior to hir gase and mekill mane to hir he mase, he said: “to salue þi-self of sare, tell me þe cause of al þi care, and out of bale I sall þe bring”. sho lay and answerd him no thing. And þan he stode als man amaid, and to þe voice eft-sones he said: “Þou creature, I coniure þe by goddes might and his pete, and bi vertu of his body and of his moder mild Mari, and by þe milk he souk swete, and þe teres þat sho for him grete when sho saw hir sun be slane, and by þe halows euerilkane: þe sertain soth þat þou me say of þis meruail, if þou may, whi þi wife has all þis payne”. And þan þe voice answerd ogayne &amp; said: “syr, (it es) all for an vnkindly syn þe whilk was done bifor my dede bitwix vs twa here in þis stede; þareof we bath war shreuen sone, bot þe penance was noght done, þarfore penance vs bus fulfill now als fer forth (als) falles þartill”. (Þan said þe) prior: “or þou pas, say to me what sin it was, þat wedded men may warned be to do swilk thinges in þat degre, or like to it in dede or thoght”. Þe voice sayd: “nay, god will it noght þat I þat sin vnto ?ow say þat thurgh shrift es done oway; and of þat sin we bath war schreuyn, þarfore of god it es forgifen als to þe blame, þat be þou balde, (bot tochand) þe penance, I þe talde aseth bus be made for þat sin or we to any welth may wyn. and sen it es done fra goddes sight, at tell it to men war noght right, bot if it war, als god forbede, þat men eft-sones did þe same dede. Bot warn wedded men &amp; to þam say þat þai wisely kepe alway þe rewl of weding with þaire might, and duly do both day and night; for þare er many commun case in whilk weded men may trispase, and þa cases er kindli to ken in þis werld omang witty men. Þis was þe soueraine point, sais he, whi þat god lete me speke with þe, for þou suld trow þis stedfastly and oþer men be mended þarby, so þat þai may þaire sins forsake and in þaire liues amendes make”. Þe woman wepeand als scho lay, with sari hert þus gan sho say: “Gude Gy, mi lord, for luf of me say if I sall saued be or I sall dwell in dole euermare for þat dede þat we did are, whareof I wate god was noght payd”. Þe voice answerd ful sune and sayd: “ þi penance nere till end es broght, (þou sal be) saued for sertayne”. and þan þe woman was ful fayne, and said þare kneleand on hir kne ane pater noster and ane Aue, and loued god in word and will. and þan þe prior sayd hir till: “Dame, whils þou þis life sall lede, luke þou ilk day do almus-dede; for almusdedes may sines waste”. Þarto þe voice answerd in haste: “dame, he said, par charite, when þou dose almus, think on me, forto alege sum of my payne”. And þan þe prior gan him frayne whi he come noght in þat sesoune vnto men of religioune, forto tell to þam his life, titter þan vntill his wife, sen þat he wist þai war more nere at pray to god, þan wemen were, and more wi(seli) þai kowth him wis. Þe voice answerd þan to þis and said: “I lufed more my wife þan any man þat beres life, and þarfore first to hir I went, and when me was gifen bi iugement to suffer penance in þis place, I asked god of his grete grace þat my wife might warned be forto amend hir mis bi me, and of his grace he gaf me leue on þis manere mi wife to greue and forto turment hir biforne, so þat sho efter might be for(borne) and þat sho sold noght haue (þe pyne) for hir sins als I haue for (mine), bot fulfill it in hir life-day”. And alsone þan þe prior (gan say): “Kan þou oght þat sho(!) sal haue ”. Þe voce said: “sho sal als lang als my bot weterly ful þat hastily it ” Þe prior said: “ how þou to (ins)trumentes of spekeing”. Þe prior said þan on þis manere: “(Ne) sese þou noght, a carpentere, (þat) diuers werkes oft-siþes has wroght, withouten ax may he do noght, and ay þe ax will redi be to hew with him on ilka tre, and it may nowther stir ne stand withowten help of mans hand? Right so a man here ?ow omell with-owten tung may no thing tell, and with his tung ?it sais he noght (bot it be) ordande of þe thoght, (and) þat es of þe saul alwais, þat ordans all þat þe tong sais. And by þis tale þou may tak tent þe body es bot ane instrument of þe saul, als þou may se, and þe saul in himself has fre (powere) of vertuse, might and minde, (þat god) has gifen to him bi kinde; (and) so he may speke properly (with-o)wten help of þe body. (and) if þou say a man mai noght (speke) þe thing þat cumes of thoght (but) if he haue mowth &amp; tung als, (I say to þe þi) saus er fals: (for hali writ) bers witnes ful right (þat go)d and al his angels bright (spak graiþeli) to ald and ?ung (and ?it had) nowþer mowth ne tung. (right so) may ilka gude spirite voices ful parfite, (and I may) at mine awin will (speke) with-ou)ten tong ?ow till”. (Þe prior asked) him in þat stede (whar saules) dwelles when men er dede þe dome be done sold wele sune payne. (Þe voice answerd &amp; said) ogayne: “ forn be lorn nd bright plight whider þat he sall iuged be to comun purgatori þat es stabill, or vnto purgatori departabill, or els vnto þe paynes of hell, or vnto heuyn in blis to dwell”. Þe prior þan with wordes hende asked how sone a saul mal (wende) when it es past fra þe body to heuyn or hell or purgatori. Þe voice answerd and said: “it may in litill space wende all þat way, sone es it broght whare it sal be. þat mai þou bi ensampill se. Þou sese when þe sun es riseand, þe light gase sone ouer ilka land, ouer al þis werld it passes playne, bot if þare stand oght þarogaine. right so þe saules, when men es ded, alsone er in þaire sertain stede, to heuyn or hell þai wend in hy; and if þai pas to purgatori, sum-tyme wend þai noght so sone, and þat es for þaire profet done. If þai haue any faithful frende in þis werld here, when þai wende, þat for þam will ger sing and rede or els do ani almus-dede, þai may so do for þam þat tide þat in þe ayre þe saul sall bide vntill it haue þe merit tane of þaire prayers euerilkane, and so by help of þaire gudenes may his penance be made les; þe dedes þat þan er done in haste vnto mens saules amendes maste. on þis same maner als I say in þis cete was done þis day: a frere died and demed was to comun purgatori at pas; bot in þe time of his transing of his breþer he asked þis thing: þat þai sold do in dede and saw for him als þai war bunden by law and messes þat þam aght to say, par charite he gan þam pray þat þai suld be said in hy, and euerilkone of oure lady, (and) afterward þan þus bitid: when he was ded, þan þus bifell: his angel demed him forto dwell in comun purgatori playne thre monethes to suffer payne als worthi was, efter his dede; bot þan oure lady ful sune ?ede vntill hir sun and prayed þat tide þat þe saul suld in þe aire abide vnto it had þe merit clere of dedes þat war done for it here. and twa owres so dwelled it still in þe aire, als was goddes will; and mercy of god had he thurgh praier of his moder fre and thurgh þe dedes þat here war done, þat he sal be in blis ful sone; in pain he has no langer tyme bot fra now till to-morn at prime”. Þan said þe prior till hym sone: “Whilk dedes of all þat here er done may titest help a saul to heuyn?” Þe voice answerd and said ful euyn: “Þe parfite werkes of charite þat er done als þam aw to be, þat es to say till goddes bihoue and oure euin-cristen if we lufe, þan of oure werkes will god be paid”. Þe prior answerd ful sone and sayd: “If þat þou can, tell vs in haste what maner of men þat now er maiste in purgatori to suffer paine?” Þe voice answerd and said ogain: “no men cumes þat place within bot anli þai þat haue done sin; and al þat sines &amp; saued sall be er pined þare of ilk degre efter þe dedes þat þai haue done”. And þan þe prior asked sone what maner of folk þat he here fand þat in þaire life war best lifand. Þe voice said: “sir, soth it es, and hali writ wele beres witnes, þat noman aw oþer to praise wheþer he do ill or wele alwaise, for mans lif es to prais nothing bot he may haue gud ending; wheþer [he] be worthi luf or (hate), (ne) wheþer his werkes er ill (or lele), vntill þe dome be done ilk dele; þan sal he se him-self sertayne wheþer he es worthi ioy or paine”. Þe prior said: “þan ask I þe, whilk es most parfite degre of all þat on þis grownd er grayd?” Þe voice answerd ful sone &amp; said: “In ilka state I se, he sais, sum thinges to lac, &amp; sum to prayse, þarfore I will prais no degre ne none sall be empaired bi me; bot neuer-þe-les ?it wald I rede þat all fulli in ilk a stede serue god with all þaire might, in what degre so þai be dight”. Þe prior asked with wordes stabill if þat god war oght merciabill to sawles þat er in purgatori. Þe voice said: “?a, sir, sertanli; vnto sum saulles, þis es sertaine, releses he forth part of þaire paine, of sum þe thrid part he releses, of sum þe secund part he seses; and þat es for gude praiers (sere) þat lifand frendes for þam (dos here); if mani dedes for þam be done þan mai þai pas fro pai(nes sone). lifand frendes þus mai þam (ses) of paines þat þai suld (haue les); and praiers helpes þam (of angels) and of halous þat in (heuyn dwells)”. Þe prior said: “þan wald I whatkin pain þi-selfe in purgatori wills (þou sal dwell)”. Þe voice said: “I sall þe tell; in flaume of fir þat all þir and haue no ” Þe prior said þ(an: “it es na fabil) þat þou ert (a spirit deceyuabil); þat sall I proue þis wate þou god dose no for his w es a gaste spirituall, (and bodili) thing mai haue no might (in spiritual) thing bi dai ne night. (and by) þis resoun may þou se (þat) fire may haue no might in þe, (al)-if þou þarin sit or gang”. Þe voice said: “sir, þou has þe wrang þat þou me haldes so decaiuabill, and þou has fun in me no fabill. Bot neuer-þe-les, sir, whare þou sais þat bodili thing bi nokins wais in gastli thing mai haue powere, I answer þe on þis manere. Þou wate wele þat þe deuils sal lend in fire of hell with-owten end, and þat fire es als bodily als þe fire of purgatori and ?it pines it þe fendes in hell; als god witnes in his godspell (ho)w he to þe fendes sal say and to þe dampned on domes-day: ‘(?e) weried wightes, I bid ?ow wende (to þe fir) þat l(ast)es withouten ende (þat ordand) es for nothing els (bot) to þe deuill and his angels’. (And) whare þou sais þat god duse noght (ogay)nes kind in þe werkes he wroght, (I sai god) dose, als men mai finde, (m)irakill oft ogaines kinde, (als sum)-time fell of childer thre (þat in fir war set) brint forto be— (þair nam)es er þai named so: (Sidrak, Mi)sac and Abdenago; with ful grete yre ful of fire, (bot als it was) oure lordes will, (þe fir did) no harm þam till. ” “ (sen þat) it es so hate and kene”. Þe voice said: “now es wele sene þat in þe es ful litil scill. (but right) now tald I þe vntill þat god may mesure thurgh his might þe strenkit of fire both dai &amp; night so þat it no harm (mai do) till thing þat it es put vnto, als he did to þe childer thre of wham I haue tald vnto þe. Also þou sese fire of leuening wendes obout in alkins thing, clereli als clerkes declare it can, and nowþer brines it hows ne man, bot if it be thurgh ani chance þat it brin bi goddes sufrance. and als þou ses þe sun mai pas thurgh windows þat er made of glas, and þe glas noght empaired þarby; so may a spirit sekerli in ilka place cum in and out and brin noght þat es him about, howses ne clathes ne oþer atyre, al-if him-self be flaumd in fire. right so þis hows mai resaiue me and it-self noght empaired be. Bot, sir, þis saltou vnderstand, if all howses in ilka land in a stede war brinand shire, it might noght be so hate a fire als I now suffer night and day”. Þe prior þan to him gan say and asked of him þis questiowne: if he trowed þe incarnacioune, how Ihesus Criste toke fless &amp; blude. Þe voice answerd with eger mode a(ls it) war greued inwardli, with loud voice þus gan he cri: “A, sir, he said, whilk er þa men þat þe incarnacioun wil noght ken? whilk er þai þat will noght knaw how angels said it in þaire saw, and deuels trowes it wonder wele, and saules in pain þai mai it fele? ful mekill wa þai er worþi þat will noght trow it stedfastli. (and all þat trowes it noght) in ded, (in) hali writ þe (soth) may rede how þat þe godspell sais of Crist: ‘wha trewli trowes and es baptist, to endles blis þai sall be broght’, and als he sais: ‘wha trowes it noght þat Crist of Mari toke oure manhede, þai sal be dampned withouten drede and euer haue bale, and neuer blis’”. Þan said þe prior: “(tell me) þis: sen þat þe Sar?ins and þe Iowes and þe paienes it noght trowes: whi god lattes þam dwell so lang in þaire trowth, sen it es wrang, and sen þai will for no resoune trow Cristes incarnacioune?” Þan þe voice said þus him till: “no questioune es it of goddes will, and þarfor (falles) it noght þe to (to) ask whi god dose so or so or thing þat towches his godhede, bot fande to do his will in dede. I wate noght whi þam life es lent, bot if it be to þis entent þat cristenmen mai on þam fight, in trowth forto defend þaire right; for batell on þam forto bede may cristen men encrese þaire mede, If faith be fulli in þaire fare”. And þan þe prior asked mare: “Kan þou oght tell whilk maner of syn es vsed moste omang man-kyn?” Þe voice þan answerd on þis wise: “Pride, Licheri, and Couatise, and Vsuri, þir foure in fere, with þair branches many and sere, þai er ful foul both day and night bifor god and his angels bright. Thre sins þare er if þai be done, for whilk god will tak vengance sone: Ane es, if man and woman here won samyn als þai wedded were and wandes noght þaire will to wirk out of þe sacrament of haly kirk, or if both be wedded þat tide and ouþer do sin on oþer side and brek þaire sposaile in þat space— to god þis es a grete trispase. kindly sodom þe sin es cald— unkindli sin men sall it hald. Þe thrid sin es ful euyl thing, þat es manslaghter with mainsuering; þis greues gretly to god mighty, whare it es done wilfully”. Sone when al þir saus war said, þe woman to þe prior prayde þat he wald speke þat gaste vntill so þat he did hir namore ill, for goddes luf of mightes maste. Þe prior þan spak to þe gaste: “I coniore þe by god allane, and bi his halows euerilkane, if þou may, þat þou will sese and lat þi wife now lif in pese, and pursu hir nomare with paine”. And þan þe voice answerd ogayne: “Þat mai I noght do, for no nede, bot sho lif chaste in widowhede, and also ger (sing for vs twa) thre hundreth messes withouten ma; a hundreth of þe haligast sal be or els of þe hali trinite, and a hundreth of oure lady, and of Requiem fifty, and oþer fifti all in-fere of saint Peter þe apostell dere”.

Þe voice answerd with wordes bald: “hali writ þus telles vs till: Þe spirit enspires whare so he will, and his voice well may þou here, bot þou may noght on no manere wit what place þat he cumes fra, ne vnto what place he will ga— Spiritus ubi uult spirat &amp; uocem eius audis: sed nescis unde ueniat aut quo uadat”.

And þan þe prior to him sais: “Lo how þat I haue gederd here freres and oþer folk in fere of þi wordes to bere witnes and of þi meruailes more &amp; les, þat we mai al þis case declare bifor þe pape, when we cum þare; and þarfore tell vs sum meruaile þat we mai tell with-owten faile”.

Þe voice said: “I can tell no thing what sall bitide in time cumyng; þarfor þou may noght wit of me how many papes of Rome sal be, ne meruailes of me wit ?e nane. and þarfore I kownsail ?ow ilkane, whare so ?e will wend forth ?owre way. bot prayes for me more, if ?e may, and for all saules þat suffers pain; for þis I say ?ow for sertayne: hali kirk praies noght so fast for cristen saules þat heþin er past als þai war won, right wele I ken, ne namore dose none oþer men. þarfore I rede þai mend þam sone, or any euill to þam be done”.

Sythene was þoue demede at þe Iewes voyce Thurghe Pilate, to be hynged one þe croyce, The wilke þou bare to-warde þe stede Whare þou was ordeynede to be done to dede.

At noune of þe daye þou cried “Hely”, &amp; ?eldide þi gaste to þi fadir Almyghty. Thus þou diede to make vs free Fra þe grett thraldome in whilke ware we. Bot mekill payne &amp; mekill reprefe Þou tholed be-fore þi dede fore oure lufe: And noghte for to bye vs agayne anely, For why þi dede moghte suffice vs all to bye, But for we sulde þare-by Ensampill take To be pacyente in angers for þi sake, And for the to thole all þat harde es, Alls þou tholede for vs thurghe þi gudnes; Ells thurte þe hafe tholede nane oþer payne Bot þe dede anely, for to bye vs agayne. Sythene was þou smetyne in þi reghte syde With a spere þat till þi herte gune glide, Fra whilke owt rane to oure saluacyone The precyous blode of owre raunso?e, With þe water of baptyme clere &amp; thyne, For to wesche vs here of þe Oregynall synne.

A, Lorde Ihesu Criste, ?it thanke I the Þat all þis &amp; mare hase done for me And for saluacyone of mankynde For whayme þou was swa bitterly pynede And sufferde dede, als I befor saide, And lett þi body be in sepulcre layde: Thow ?ernede sa mekill agayne to wyne All þas þat þou hade loste for syne, That whene þow was dede &amp; ?eldede þe gaste, Als tyte till hell þou gun þe haste, In saule &amp; godhede, als was þi will, Thy body whils in þe sepulcre lay styll; Till þou at hell come þou walde noghte stynte &amp; ware sesede of þas þat þou hade tynte. Thow spoylede hell whene þou come þare, And tuke owt with þe all þat thyne ware. Bot þou lefte þas þare þat walde noghte trowe In þi lawe, ne in þi biddynge bewe.

For sekere of mercy nane getes he, In þis life bot he turne hym till þe; And nane may þat daye be saffe, Bot he þi mercy In þis lyfe hafe, Of whilke þou erte large &amp; leberall To grante it bathe grete &amp; smalle That mercy askes &amp; folowes þare-to, And dos þare-fore þat þeme falles to doo. Whare-fore, Lorde, sene þou arte ay redy To graunte till ilke a mane þi mercy That sekes þar-to whils þay here lyffe, Swilke grace in þis lyfe þou me gyffe To turne me &amp; to fle syne, Þat I may here þi mercy wyne, Thurghe whilke I may at þe dredfull day Be led to þe blyse þat sall last ay. Amen.</field>
