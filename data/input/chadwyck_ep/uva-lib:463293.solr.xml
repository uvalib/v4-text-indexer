      <field name="fulltext">Alli verifiglioli delle Muse. Ye moderne Lawreats famousd for your writ, VVho for your pregnance may in Delos dwelt, On your sweete lines eternitie doth sit, Their browes enobling with applause and lawrell. Triumph and honor ay inuest your writ, Ye fett your penns from wing of singing swanne, VVhen sweetely warbling to her selfe she flotes Adowne Meander streames, and like to Organ Imparts into her quils melodious notes. Ye from the father of delicious phrases, Borrow such hymns as make your mistresse liue VVhen time is dead, nay Hermes tunes the praises, VVhich ye in sonnets to your mistresse giue. Report throughout our westerne Isle doth ring, The sweete tun'd accents of your Delian sonnetrie, VVhich to Apollos violine ye sing, Oh then your high straines drowne his melodie. From forth dead sleepe of euerlasting darke, Fame with her trumps shrill summon hath awakt The Romayne Naso and the Tuskan Petrarch, Your spirit-rauishing lines to wonder at. Oh theame befitting high mus'd Astrophil, He to your siluerie songs lent sweetest touch, Your songs the immortall spirit of your quill, Oh pardon, for my artlesse pen to much Doth dimme your glories through his infant skill. Though may J not with you the spoyles deuide (Ye sacred of-spring of Mnemosyne) Of endlesse praise which haue your pens atchiu'd, (Your pens the trumps to immortallitie) Yet be it leyfull that like maymes I bide Like brunts and skarres in your loues warfare, And here though in my home-spun verse of them declare. Canzon. 1. [Lvld in an heauenly Charme of pleasing passions] Lvld in an heauenly Charme of pleasing passions, Many their well thewd rimes doe fayre attemper Vnto their amours, while another fashions Loue to his lines, and he on fame doth venter. And some againe in mercinary writ Belch forth desire, making reward their Mistresse: And though it chaunce some Lais Patron it, At least they sell her prayses to the presse. The Muses Nurse I reade is Euphemie, And who but honor makes his lines reward, Comes not by my consent within my petigree, 'Mongst true borne sonnes enherit may no bastard. All in the humble accent of my Muse, Whose wing may not aspire the pitch of fame, My grieues I here vnto ombe, sweete them peruse. Though low he flye, yet honor is his game, All while my pen quests on Zepherias name, Whom when it sprung thy wing did thee releeue, Now flowne to marke, thus doth desire thee retreeue. Canzon. 2. [Though be thou limn'd in these discoloured lines] Though be thou limn'd in these discoloured lines, Delicious model of my spirits portraict, Though be thou sable pencild, these deseygnes Shadow not beautie but a sorrowes extract. When I empris'd though in my loues affections, The siluer lustre of thy brow to vnmaske Though hath my Muse hyberboliz'd traiections: Yet stands it aye deficient to such taske. My slubbring pencil casts too grosse a matter, Thy beauties pure deuinitie to blaze: For when my smoothed tongue hath sought to flatter, Thy worth hath deartht his words for thy due praise: Then though my pencil glaunce here on thine eyes, Sweet thinke thy fayre it doth but portionize. Canzon. 3. [When from the towre whence I deriue loues heauen] When from the towre whence I deriue loues heauen, Mine eyes (quick Purseuants) the sight attached, Of thee all splendent I as out of sweauen, My selfe gan rowse, like one from sleepe awaked. Coueting eyes control'd my slowly gate, And wood desire to wing my feete for flight: Yet vnresolu'd, feare did with eyes debate, And sayd, t'was but tralucence of the light: But when approacht where thou thy stand didst take, At gaze I stood like Deere when gast he spyes Some white in thicke, ah then the arrow strake Thorough mine heart sent from thy tiller eyes: Dead in thine ayme, thou seazd what long'd to thee, Mine heart, (Zepheria) then became thy fee. Canzon. 4. [Oh then Desire, father of iouisance] Oh then Desire, father of iouisance, The life of loue, the death of dastard feare, The kindest Nurse to true perseuerance, Mine heart enherited with thy loues reuere. Beautie peculiar parent of conceite, Prosperous Midwife to a trauelling Muse, The sweete of life Nepenthe eyes receite, Thee into me distild oh sweete infuse. Loue then the spirit of a generous sprite, An infant euer drawing Natures brest, The summe of life that Chaos did vnnight Dismist mine heart from me with thee to rest. And now incites me cry double or quit, Giue back my heart, or take his body to it. Canzon. 5. [Anon Feare, Centinell of sad discretion] Anon Feare, Centinell of sad discretion, Strangling Repentance in his cradle age, Cares Vsher, Tenant to his owne oppression, Forst my thoughts quest vpon an idle rage. Enraged passion, skout to loue vntrue, Commenting gloses on each smile and frowne, Christning the Heauens, and Erebus anew, Intollerable yoke to loue and reason. Footstoole to all affects, Beauties sowre handmayd, The harts hermophrodite passiue in action: Hope now serenes his brow, anon dismayd, A pleasing death, a life in pleasd distraction. Thou on thy mother Feare begot Despayre, To whom my fate conuayes me sonne and heyre. Canzon. 6. [My fate, oh not my fault hath me debard] My fate, oh not my fault hath me debard From forth thy fauors sunny Sanctuary, Vnto the deare applause of thy regard, Witnesse the world how I my gest did marry. My teares, my sighs, all haue I summ'd in thee: Conceyt the totall, doe not partialize, And then accept of their infinitie, As part of payment to exacting eyes. And yet thy trophey to enoble more, My heart prepares anew to Thezaurize Sighs and loue options sike as it sent of yore, Saue number they, faith only these englories: Yet though I thus enwealthy thy exchequer, Seeme it not strange, I liue Zepherias debter. Canzon. 7. [More fayre, but yet more cruell I thee deeme] More fayre, but yet more cruell I thee deeme, (Though by how much the more thou beautious art, So much of pitie shouldst thou more esteeme) Fayrer then PhÅbe, yet a harder hart. Her when ActÃ¦on viewd with priuie eye, She doom'd him but a death, (a death he ow'd) While he pursu'd before his dogs did flye: Here was the worst of ill (good Queene) she show'd: But when a start mine eye had thee espyed, (Though at discouert) yet stand I sentenced, Not to one death to which I would haue hyed: For since vnarmed and to eye vnfenced, Thy PhÅbe fayrer parts were mine eyes prospectiue (Oh griefe) vnto my selfe disgrac'd I liue. Canzon. 8. [Illuminating Lamps, ye Orbs christallite] Illuminating Lamps, ye Orbs christallite, Transparant mirrolds, globes deuining beautie, How haue I ioyd to wanton in your light? (Though was I slayne by your artillerie.) Ye blithsome starres, (like Ledas louely twins, When cleare they twinckle in the firmament, Promise esperance to the Sea-mens wandrings) So haue your shine made ripe mine hearts content: Or as the light which Sestyan Hero show'd, Arme-finnd Leander to direct in waues, When through the raging Hellespont he row'd, Steering to Loues port: so by thine eyes cleere rayes Blest were my wayes: but since no light was found, Thy poore Leander in the deepe is drownd. Canzon. 9. [When as the golden Waggoner had frayd] When as the golden Waggoner had frayd Black winters outrage with his brighter shine, And that in mansion of the twins he stayd His teeme, then gan my heart to twin with thine. Euen when his gorgeous mantell he had spred, Wherewith he wip't wept teares from Tellus bosome, Wantoning here with her, leaues Thetis bed, Like daintie Midwife Flora to vnwoombe Sweet babes of Tellus and Hiperion. When ye full soom'd in winters mew doon mooting, Oh then the seedes of loue by thine eyes sown Downe through mine eyes within mine heart took rooting. This difference left twixt me, and natures store, Her spring returnes, my flowre may spred no more. Canzon. 10. [How made I then attempt in courtly fashion] How made I then attempt in courtly fashion To gayne the virgin conquest of thy loue? How did my sighs decypher inward passion When they to kind regard thy heart did moue? When thou voutsafst to grace the euening ayre, How haue I layne in ambush to betray thee? Our eyes haue skirmisht: but my tongue would pray thee To ioyne thy pitie partner with thy fayre. Since that, how often haue they sent wept Elegies To beg remorse at thy obdurat hart? How often hath my muse in Comick poesies (To feed thy humor) playd a Comick part? But now the pastime of my pen is silenced, To act in Tragick vayne alone is licensed. Canzon. 11. [How wert thou pleased with my pastorall Ode] How wert thou pleased with my pastorall Ode, (Which late I sent thee) wherein I thy Swayne In rurall tune on pipe did chaunt abroad Thee for the loueliest lasse that trac'd the playne? There on thy head I Floras chaplet placed, There did my pipe proclayme thee Sommers Queene: Each heard-groome with that honor held thee graced, When lawnie white did checker with thy greene. There did I bargayne all my Kids to thee, My spotted Lambkins choysest of my fold, So thou wouldst sit and keepe thy flock by me: So much I ioy'd thy beautie to behold. How many Cantons then sent I to thee? Who though on two strings only rays'd their strayne, To wit my griefe, and thy vnmatched beautie: Yet well their harmonie couth please thy vayne, Well couth they please thee, &amp; thou terme th? wittie: But now as fortunes change, so change my dittie. Canzon. 12. [How often haue mine eyes, thine eyes apprentises] How often haue mine eyes, thine eyes apprentises (Bound by the earnest of a sunny looke) Tane a iudiciall view of all thy graces? Which here are registred in lasting booke. How oft haue I thy precious cheyne bin fingring, That ninefold circles thy delicious neck, While they the orb-like spheares of heauen resembling, Thy face the globe which men clepe Empereick? How oft with wanton touches haue I prest Those breasts, more soft then siluer downe of Swans, When they by Alcidelian Springs doe rest, Of which pure substance are thy lillie hands? But now, though eyes ne see, nor armes embrace thee, Who yet shall let in thought me chiefe to place thee? Canzon. 13. [Proud in thy loue, how many haue I cited] Proud in thy loue, how many haue I cited (Impartiall) thee to view? whose eyes haue lauisht Sweet beautious obiects oft haue men delighted: But thou aboue delight their sense hast rauisht. They amorous artists thee pronounc'd loues Queene, And vnto thy supremacie did sweare, Uenus at Paphos keepe, no more be seene, Now Cupid after thee his shafts shall beare. How haue I spent my spirit of inuention, In penning amorous Stanza's to thy beautie? But heauenly graces may not brooke dimension, No more may thine, for infinite they be. But now in harsh tune I of amours sing, My pipe for them growes hoarse, but shrill to playning. Canzon. 14. [Though like an exile from thine eyes diuorc'd] Though like an exile from thine eyes diuorc'd, In solitarie dungeon of refuse I liue (impatient that I liue perforc'd From thee deare obiect of mine eyes a recluse: Yet that deuine JdÃ¦a of thy grace, The life-immagerie of thy loues sweet souenance Within mine heart shall raigne in soueraigne place: Nay shall it euer pourtray other semblance? No neuer shall that face so fayre depaynted Within the loue-limn'd tablet of mine hart Emblemisht be, defaced or vnsaynted, Till death shall blot it with his pencill dart: Yet then in these limn'd lines enobled more, Thou shalt suruiue richer accomplisht then before. Canzon. 15. [Neare were the siluerie wings of my desire] Neare were the siluerie wings of my desire Taynted with thought of black impuritie: The modest blush that did my cheekes attire Was to thy virgin feares statute securitie. When to a fauours sweete promotion My ioylesse thoughts thou hast aduanced hier, Oh then sighs sacrifice of my loues deuotion, I sent repurified in holy fier. My feares how oft haue I engeminated? Oh black recite of passed miserie! Thy heart for to entender they haue intimated (Besides what thou hast seene) what I haue suffred for thee: But see, since eyes were aliens to thy beautie, I sing mine owne faith, and neglect loues dutie. Canzon. 16. [How haue I forfaited thy kind regard?] How haue I forfaited thy kind regard? That thy disdaine should thus enage my brow, Which whilome was the scripture and the card Whereon thou made thy game and seal'd thy vow. Which whilome thou with lawrell vaticall Enobled hast, (high signall of renowne) Marrying my voyce with thine hast sayd withall, Be thou alone, alonely thou Amphion. Oh how hath black night welked vp this day? My wasted hopes why are they turn'd to graze? In pastures of despayre, Zepheria say, Wherein haue I on loue committed trespasse? Oh if in iustice thou must needes acquit me, Reward me with thy loue, sweete heale me with thy pitie Canzon. 17. [How shall I deck my loue in loues habiliment] How shall I deck my loue in loues habiliment, And her embellish in a right depaint? Sith now is left nor Rose, nor Hyacint, Each one their beauties with their hue acquaint. The golden seeling of thy browes rich frame Designes the proud pomp of thy faces architure: Chrystall transparant casements to the same Are thine eyes sunne, which doe the world depure, Whose siluerie canopie gold wier fringes: Thy brow the bowling place for Cupids eye, Loues true-loue knots, and lilly-lozenges Thy cheekes depaynten in an immortall dye. If well thou limn'd art now by face immagerie, Iudge how by life I then should pencill thee. Canzon. 18. [Exacter should it fortune I should pencill thee] Exacter should it fortune I should pencill thee, What glorie may attend though on my skill? Euen such as him befals, whose pen doth coppie The sweet inuention of anothers quill. My muse yet neuer iournied to the Inds Thy fayre to purple in Alchermyan dye, All on the weake spred of his eyess wings Sufficeth that thou mount, though not so hye: Yet should it hap, that in a kind voutsafe The feature of my pen some grace do win, There of Zepheria all the honor hath, The coppying Scribe may clayme no right therein: But if more nice wits censure my lines crooked, Thus I excuse, I writ my light remoued. Canzon. 19. [No no Zepheria, fame is too rich a prize] No no Zepheria, fame is too rich a prize My all vnmeriting lines for to attend on The best applause of my muse; on thine eyes Depends, it craues but smiles his paynes to guerdon, Be thine the glorie of this weake emprise, Well wote I his demerit is but bare: Dutious respect then will not that I portionize To me in loues respect equall like care. Louely respectiue equall thou this care, And with thine heauens calme smiles mine heart imparadize: Shine forth thy comforts sunne, my feares dismayer, Oh well it fits louers to simpathize. Hold thou the spoyles of fame for thine enheritance, Thy loue to me is sweetest cheuisance. Canzon. 20. [How often hath my pen mine hearts solicitour] How often hath my pen mine hearts solicitour Instructed thee in breuiat of my case? While fancie pleading eyes (thy beauties visitour) Haue patternd to my quill an angels face. How haue my Sonnets (faithfull counsellers) Thee without ceasing mou'd for day of hearing? While they my plaintiue cause (my faiths reuealers) Thy long delay, my patience in thine eare-ring. How haue I stood at barre of thine owne conscience? When in requesting court my suite I brought. How haue thy long adiournments slow'd the sentence, Which I through much expence of teares besought? Through many difficulties haue I run, Ah sooner wert thou lost (I wis) then wonne. Canzon. 21. [And is it by immutable decree] And is it by immutable decree (Immutable, yet cruell ordenance) Ordayn'd (still forst I cry oh strange impietie) On true-loue to impose such tyrant penance? That we vnto each other shall surrender The seal'd indentures of our loue compacted, And that thereof we make such loyall tender, As best shall seeme to them that so enacted. Then list while I aduertise once againe, Though we yeeld vp our charters so ensealed: Yet see that thou safe-guard my counterpane, And I in heart shall keepe thy bond vncanceled: And so hereafter (if at least you please) 'Weele plead this redeliuerie was by duresse. Canzon. 22. [It was not long agoe since like a wanton] It was not long agoe since like a wanton Froward displeas'd with that it loues (I wis) (Improuid) I did write to thee a Canton, Wherein I seem'd to turne loue out of seruice. Well sayd I herein that I did but seeme it, (Loth to depart) he still retayn'd to me: (Although displeas'd) yet each one well might deeme He was my seruant while he wore my liuerie. Pensiuely grieu'd with that, that I had done, I writ a Sonnet, which by sillable Eate vp the former, and withall crau'd pardon, Vowing a large amends as time should able. But who beyond his power vowes, he offends, Presumptuous as thou art to name amends. Canzon. 23. [Thy corall coloured lips how should I pourtray] Thy corall coloured lips how should I pourtray Vnto the vnmatchable patterne of their sweet? A draught of blessednesse I stole away From them when last I kist, I tast it yet: So did that sugrie touch my lips en-sucket: On them Mineruas hunny birds doe hiue Mellifluous words when so thou please to frame Thy speech to entertainment, thence I deriue My hearts sole paradize and my lips sweet gaine. Ye are the corall gates of temples Clarion, Where out the Pithyus preacht Diuinitie, Vnto thy voyce bequeath'd the good Arion His siluerie lire, such PÃ¦an melodie Thy voyce the organ pipe of Angels quire Trebles, yet one kisse and Ile raise them hier. Canzon. 24. [Vnto the Muses I resigne my skroule] Vnto the Muses I resigne my skroule, Who sing with voyce vnto the spheares proportionable Sing ye, oh write ye of my loues pure soule, Vnbody it, in words inimitable. In high spheare then see ye her name inrold, On her heart throne sits the deuine AstrÃ¦a, Who doth the ballance of her fauors hold, Which she imparts in iustice and demerit: For virgin puritie white GalatÃ¦a Doth type the sanctitie of her purer spirit, She the fourth grace hight PasithÃ¦a Only recorded by our first borne sonne, Whom after long sleepe we shall now vntoombe, And her translate into Zepheria, Amidst the Charites possesse thy roome, Thia in heart, zealous Vrania, The soules Musition sweete Thelxione, Daughter of loue and admiration. A vayle immortall shall we put on thee, And on thy head instarre the gnosian Crowne: Ariadne doth her selfe vndeifie, Yeelding her coronall to thine installation. Now liue in starry stage of heauen a deitie, And sing we Io Zepheria all in a rowne: Hold take thy skroule with wing of immortallitie, Thy loue is clad, nay ought may her vnsanctifie But proud disdaine; thanks sweet Caliope. Canzon. 25. [Let not disdayne thy soule vnsanctifie] Let not disdayne thy soule vnsanctifie, Disdayne the pasport for a louers vow, Vnsieging where it seekes to fortifie. With deadly frownes the canons of the brow. Let not disdayne the herse of virgin graces, The counterpoyson to vnchastitie, The leauen that doth sowre the sweetest faces, Stayne thy new purchast immortalitie. 'Mongst Delian Nymphs in Angels vniuersitie Thou my Zepheria liu'st matriculated, The daughters of ethereall Ioue thy deitie On holy hill haue aye perpetuated. Oh then retire thy browes artillerie, Loue more, and more blisse yet shall honor thee. Canzon. 26. [When we in kind embracements had agre'd] When we in kind embracements had agre'd To keepe a royall banquet on our lips, How soone haue we another feast decreed? And how at parting haue we mourn'd by fits? Eftsoones in absence haue we wayld much more, Till those voyd houres of intermission Were spent, that we might reuell as before, How haue we bribed time for expedition? And when remitted to our former loue-playes, How haue we (ouerweening in deligth) Accus'd the father Sexten of the dayes? That then with Eagles wings he tooke his flight. But now (old man) flye on, as swift as thought, Sith eyes from loue and hope from heart is wrought. Canzon. 27. [Neare from a loftie pitch, hath made more speed] Neare from a loftie pitch, hath made more speed The feather-sayling Faulcon to the lure, Nor fayrer stoopt, when he on fist would feede, Then I (Zepheria) to thine eyes allure. Neare from the deepe, when winds declare a tempest, Posts with more haste the little Halcion, Nor faster hyes him to some safer rest, Then I haue fled from thy death-threatning frown. Nere did the Sunnes loue-mate, the gold Hetropion Smile more resplendent lustre on her deere, Nay euer was his shine to her more welcome Then thine to me, when smiling was thy cheere. But now my sunne it fits thou take thy set, And vayle thy face with frownes as with a frontlet. Canzon. 28. [When cleere hath bin thy brow &amp; free from wrinckle] When cleere hath bin thy brow &amp; free from wrinckle, (Thy smoothed brow my soules sole Hyrarchy) When sweetly hath appear'd in cheeke the dimple (Their loue enthron'd swayes powrefull Monarchy) Glad, haue I then rich statues to his deitie Erected, then haue I his altar hallowed, His rites I held with hie solemnitie, His trophey deckt, and it with rosebuds strowed. I kist thy cheeke, then thou with gold artillerie Hast him engyrt, tasseld with purple twine Featly contriu'd to hang his quiuer by, Besides a crimson scarfe to vayle his eyne: But see, no sooner was he gay apparelled But that (false boy) away from vs he fled. Canzon. 29. [How many golden dayes haue I set free] How many golden dayes haue I set free From tedious trauell in a sadder muse? While I of amours haue conferd with thee, While I long absence neuer need excuse. Sweet was occasion, and for sweet inexplicable That eyes inuited guests vnto thine eyes fare, When by thy daintie leaue on Corall table I fed, oh there I suckt celestiall ayre. Amidst these sugrie iunkets thirstie I Haue thy delicious hand with my lips prest, I drew for wine, but found twas Ambrosie, Oh how my spirits inly that refresht: Yet aye me since I relisht this delight, I eare more thirsted with a hotter appetite. Canzon. 30. [What shall I neare more see those Halcion dayes] What shall I neare more see those Halcion dayes, Those sunny Sabboths, dayes of Jubilee? Wherein I carold merrie Roundelayes, Odes, and loue-songs, which being viewd by thee, Receau'd allowance worthie better writ. When we on Shepherds holy-dayes haue hyed Downe to the flowrie pastures; flowres for thy treading Holy the day when thou it sanctified, When thou (Zepheria) wouldst but dayne to blesse it. How haue I (iealous ouer PhÅbus rayes) Clouded thy fayre? then fearing he would gesse it By thy white brow, it haue I cinct with bayes: But woe is me, that I haue fenst thy beautie, Sith other must enioy it, and not I. Canzon. 31. [Yet none shall equall me in my demerit] Yet none shall equall me in my demerit, Though happier (may it fortune) he may court it: Nor shall more faithfull loue his suite enherit, Ne paynt like passion, though he shew more wit. Admit he write, my quill hath done as much: Admit he sigh, that haue I done and more: Admit he weepe, these eyes haue wept euen such Their teares as heartie, and in greater store: Yet neerer may he presse, and sweare he dyes, Joue (thinks he) smiles at louers iurament: Proue him, then shalt thou finde he falsely lyes: Many so threaten death, that nil experiment; Repulst, then will he sue to doe thee seruice: Sayd not I well now, that he falsely lyes? Canzon. 32. [Nature (I finde) doth once a yeare hold market] Nature (I finde) doth once a yeare hold market A gawdie fayre of Brooches and of Babies, And bounteously to all doth she impart it, Yet chiefly to true louers, and fayre Ladies. There may you see her dappart Com'naltie Clad some in purple, some in scarlet dye, Whiles she (rich Queene) in all her royaltie Commands them spred their chaffer to the eye. The buyer payes no impost nor no fees, But rather to inuite with wealthier pleasure, She booths her faire with shade of broad-brancht trees, Wherin (good Queene) hir care doth match hir treasure With wealth of more cost Nature doth thee beautifie, Saue careles she hath left no shelter gaynst thine eye. Canzon. 33. [Hether chast PhÅbes Nymphs flockt in procession] Hether chast PhÅbes Nymphs flockt in procession, Whose beauties attractiue all eyes so exercis'd With maz'd admire, that for some late transgression Men ween'd heauens angels were vnparadiz'd. Such Saints heauens paradize containes but few, Their rose at beauties Natures wealth distaynd, Compar'd their lustre, checkt her verdant hew, They euen her purest quintessence engraynd. Anemone there stood with Daffadilly, The purple Hyacinth and the Musk-rose, Red Amaranthus and the milk-bred Lilly, I came in quest, yet would I none of those: Vnto Hyperions Bride my choyse I knit, There in her goldie leaues my loue is writ. Canzon. 34. [Since from the full feed of thy fauors lease] Since from the full feed of thy fauors lease, My thoughts (oh times accursed memorie) Were forst (such shift alas did ill them please) To crop on sedge sowre and vnsauorie: Since from their sweet refresh all pined, they Haue spent a lustre in sad widdowhood, Since when sorrow to them hath seru'd in pay Outlawes to hope, immur'd from euery good: Since from thy brow the pompous gallerie, Wherein were storiz'd to mine eye sweet obiects, Embroydred all with rare immagerie, Whose Iuorie floore enameld azure frets Mine eye, oh woe the while hath bin sequestred, My heart his griefe therefore in face hath registred. Canzon. 35. [Since from the flowred sweetes of euery blessednesse] Since from the flowred sweetes of euery blessednesse Which from thy beauties delicate peruse Incessantly doth flow, mine heart like Ancresse I cloystred liues to sad and cheerelesse muse. If any smiling ioy fortune to fawne on me, Suggesting to my spirit sweet content, Anon I article with his felicitie, And ere mine heart voutsafes him entertaynment, I him depose on these Intergatories. First, if he came from my Zepheria, Then if he may to light restore mine eyes Which long haue dwelt in darke: if then he say Nay, but thy thoughts to vnbend from of her beauties I come, eftsoones I strangle him while in his infancie, Better slay him then he doe thee to dye. Canzon. 36. [But if with error and vniust suspect] But if with error and vniust suspect Thou shalt the burden of my grieuance aggrauate, Laying vnto my charge thy loues neglect, A lode which patience cannot tolerate: First to be Atlas to mine owne desire, Then to depresse me with vnkind construction, While to mine owne grieues may I scarce respire: This is to heape Ossa on Pelion. Oh would the reach yet of vnequall censure Might here but date his partialitie: Mistrust, who neare is ripe till worst be thought on, Hath my crime rackt, yet to more hye extensure, And now tis drawne to flat Apostacie: So straight beset, best I lay hold on pardon. Why then sith better i'st a penitentiarie To saue then to expose to shames confusion: Thy face being vayld, this pennance I award, Clad in white sheet thou stand in Paules Churchyard. Canzon. 37. [When last mine eyes dislodged from thy beautie] When last mine eyes dislodged from thy beautie, Though seru'd with proces of a parents writ, A Supersedeas countermanding dutie Euen then I saw vpon thy smiles to sit. Those smiles which me inuited to a partie, Disperpling clowdes of faint respecting feare Agaynst the summons which was seru'd on me, A larger priuiledge of dispence did beare. Thine eyes edict the statute of repeale Doth other duties wholly abrogate, Saue such as thee endeere in heartie zeale: Then be it farre from me that I should derogate From natures law enregistred in thee: So might my loue encur a premunire. Canzon. 38. [From the reuenew of thine eyes exchequer] From the reuenew of thine eyes exchequer, My faith his subsidie did neare detract, Though in thy fauours booke I rest thy debter, Yet' mongst accomptants who their faith haue crackt, My name thou findest not irrotulat: I list not stand indebted to infame; Fowle them befall who pay in counterfaite; Be they recogniz'd in black booke of shame. But if the rent which wont was of assise Thou shalt enhaunce, through pride and coy disdayne, Exacting double tribute to thine eyes, And yet encrochest on my hearts demayne: Needes must I wish, though gaynst my foyaltie, That thou vnsceptred be of natures royaltie. Canzon. 39. [And now thou wing'd Embassador of wonder] And now thou wing'd Embassador of wonder, Liberall dispenser of reproachfull act, Who neuer whisperst, but in voyce of thunder, Explor'st what secresie would fayne haue darkt. Tell my Zepheria, sith thou nil be silenced, My hopes on her calme smiles did them embarke, Whose sunny shine seem'd to haue licenced From them all feare of tempest or of wracke. Now on the shelfe of her browes proud disdayne, A harbor where they looked for azile, The Pilot who fore now did expert rayne, His barke, in seas are all ydrencht, alack the while. Tell if at least she all through feare excordiat, Command thee not to peace ere thou exordiat. Canzon. 40. [But if she shall attend what fortunes sequeld] But if she shall attend what fortunes sequeld The naufrage of my poore afflicted barke, Then tell, but tell in words vnsillabled, In sighs vntuned accents moue her to harke Vnto the tenor of thy sadder processe: Say then his teares (his hearts intelligencers) Did intimate the grieues did him possesse, Crying, Zepheria vnto thee these messengers I send, oh these my loues my faith shall witnesse: Oh these shall record loues and faith vnfayned, Looke how my soule bathes in their innocencie, Whose dying confidence him designes vnstayned Of guiltie blush note of impuritie, Oh death high way to life, when loue 'is disdayned. This sayd, if cruell she no grace voutsafe, Dead, may her graues stone be her Epitaph Troppo Sperar inganna. FINIS.</field>
