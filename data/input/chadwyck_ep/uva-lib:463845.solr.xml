For lo, thy monting Muse with Verse-wrought-wings, Detombs, Intomb'd long since, thy Countrie Kings. THE THEATRE OF THE Scotish Kings. Fergus the First, King of SCOTLAND, Rang the Yeer befoir Christ 330, and Rang 5 Yeers. The first Foundator and the lawfull Lord, The Roiall Roote, Stock and th'Imperial Stemme, First gave our Lawis, this Countrie first decoird, And did adorne It with a Diadem: The boasting Britons, with his Force, he frights, Boece 3 Book of his Chronicles p. 3. And first Contracts and Comprimitts with Pights. WITH Favoring, and with a friendlie Fate, His Deeds, his Foes from his Dominions dreave: His Sword secuir'd, his Sceptre and Estate, And muche enlarg'd, It, to his Line, did leave: Io. Maior de Gestis Scot. l. 1. f. 18. Ihon Ionst. in Inscrip. Reg. Scot. fol. 1. Yet whom no Pow're nor Practeis, could supprise, Undone and drownd, in th'Irish Deeph, he dies. Ferithare, 2? King, Rang the Yeer befoir Christ 305, fra the begining of the Kingdome 26, and Rang 15 Yeers. King FERGUS Valor and his Vertues rare, Great Fortitude, Wit, Justice and Ingine, Now maks thy Fame, more famous, FERITHARE, Since in thy Actions, thay assembled shine: Hee rulde befoir, by Right, be Reason Thou The Scepter swayes, and dois governe it now. THOU Rang in Rest, and holilie Thou held Thy vowed-Word, and when th'Invious wold True Vertue wrong, Thy Power thairs Repeld: Vertue, in vane, is curbed or controld: For when it is molested most, the more It waxes then, it dois extend and store. Mainus, 3? King, Rang befoir Christ 291, frome the begining of the Kingdome 41, and Rang 25 Yeers. O noble Prince, Preordain'd to Impire, Come move the Mace now of thy banisht Brother: Whose Naughtie and Inordinat Desire, Tint him his Crowne and Countrie both together. How different is, to his unatural Deeds, Thy quiet Course, that to his Seat succeeds. THOU came with Peace, and into Rest thou Rang, Thou lov'de Religione, tho' thou lackit Light: Thou Cherish'd Vertue, and thou chasteisd Wrang, And ruld thy Regne, according to the Right: So as into thy Days appeired plane, The golden Aige, to be return'd agane. Dornadilla, 4?? King, Rang befoir Christ 262, fra the begining of the Kingdome 70, and Rang 28 Yeers. A prince to Peace, and Quietness inclinde He sceptered with Pleasure and with Peace, But all Ambitioun or a mounting Mind, He calmly did command in euerie Case; No foraigne Foe, no home-bred Limmer left That in his Raigne, the common Rest bereft. AMIDS the Peace, to Hunt and Pastime prone For Hunting-laws and Ordors he ordains: Which nought the les, so many Aiges gone, As yet among our Montane Men remains: In that same force, full Vigor and Effect As when King DORNADILL did thame direct. O HAPPY Regne, O King more happy Thou Who Peace possesd and stird thy State but strife; To th'auntient Kings, to be preferred now, That in excesse, but labours, led their Life. From which corrupt, excessive Pleasure springs, Confusioun of Countries, and of Kings: Nothak, 5?? King, Rang befoir Christ 233, fra the begining of the Kingdom 98, and Rang 20 Years. When first he got the Helm into his Hand, And was Elect, and calld into the Crowne: He did deface the Laws into his Land, His subjects slew, dispatched, and pat downe: His mightie men, or thame in Prison putts, And with thair Goods, his Greedines he glutts. THIS leprous Life with Perfidie he fand, Th'Eternal Truth, unpunish'd spaird not than Nor suffred suche, a State-distroier stand, That plaide much more, the Monstre nor the Man: For as his Life was loathsome that he Leiv'de, So more reproachful his Departure preiv'de. Rewther, 6?? King, Rang befoir Christ 213, fra the begining of the Kingdom 118, and Rang 26 Yeers. A prince as young, so he imprudent proov'de, Before his Knowledge, to his Crowne he came: Be Dovalus, a Man ambitious moov'd, Who all infested with a factious flame: And bred a bloodie and intestine Strife, Where Dowall died, and many lost their Life. THIS Prince near sunck in those seditious Seas: Faught contrare both his Fortune and his Foes: And after oft times tried Extremities To th'Isles and Ireland, for Refuge he gois: From whence he comes, with his confedrat Pights, And gainst his Foes, with better Forton, fights. Revda, 7?? King, Rang befoir Christ 187, fra the begining of the Kingdome 144, and Rang 14 Yeers. This Peacible, Just and Politick Prence, His Countrie-men to Honor first invents: Who stoutlie fought, or deit for her Defence, With Obelisks and Marble Monuments: No Writt, nor Letters, wes Invenit then, For to preserve thame, be the Press or Pen. H' abhor'd Debait, Thingis ruin'd he erects And Lator was, of many sindrie Lawes: He grac'd the good Men and the wicked wrecks, Then to his Countrie cunning Crafts-men drawes: To teach her skill in Artificial Things, And then the Crowne to THEREUS he resigns. Thereus, 8?? King, Rang befoir Christ 171, fra the begining of the Kingdome 158, and Rang 12 Yeers. A prince appeiring good when he began, But Hipocreit, soon after six Months He: With ane louse Raine, t'Unrighteousnes he Ran And plainly practeis'd all Impietie: Drunk with Desire of Murder and Mischiefe, And with Delight, of Lust, beyonde Beleefe. BUT lo his Lords, that could not byde nor beare, The burden of his Tirraneis extreame: That pitiles he practeis'd heir and theare, But sense of Sinne, or ony sight of Sheame: Thay caught the Croune, and he affraied flies In Britane, whair exild, distres'd he dies. Josine, 9?? King, Rang befoir Christ 161, fra the begining of the Kingdome 170, and Rang 24 Yeers. A gentle King, addicted and dispois'd To come to Knowledge in the Phisick Arte, Whairin he much delighted and rejoisde, And (thought a Prince) by Practeis proovde exparte: And likewise those in Veneratioun hild, That then war known, into that Calling, skil'd. WHILL he Impires, his People Peace possest, And wes not with, tempestuous Troubles tost: Whairfoir amidst this Quietnes and Rest, His Subjects us'd, his Exercise almost: A Prince that did deserve farr better daies, Then those vnlearned to express his praise. Finnane, 10?? King, Rang befoir Christ 137, fra the begining of the Kingdome 194, and Rang 30 Yeers. No wracking Warr, no Battell, nor Debate, Oppressioun, Hostilitie, nor Wrong Did once disturb this Countreis quiet State, Whill as the Fortunate King FINNANE Rang: The Citie, Court, the Cloun and Common-Weell, Alike they did, this Heav'nlie Favor feele. THE former Princelie Power he impaires, And limitats it, to perpetuall Lawes: That no King shall, that dois succeed his Heyres Conclude but Counsall in the common Cause: Tak Peace, nor Battell bid, upon Debates, Without a Statute of the Thrie Estates. Durstus, 11?? King, Rang befoir Christ 107, fra the begining of the Kingdome 224, and Rang 9 Yeers. O what a Pest, and Prince profane he proved This dissolute King DURSTUS in his Daies: For all the Lords his Father FINNANE loved He carcerats, or inhumanelie Slaies. And Butcheour-like, his Subjects kind he kills, So all his Land, with Facts infamous, fills. THIS wicked Sone of such a Virtuous Sire, Knowne for a King, by nothing but the Name: Unworthie of Advancement or Impire, Or t'have the Dignit' of a Diademe: Is for his Life, polluted and profane, Be Insurrection of his Subjects, slane. Ewin I. 12?? King, Rang befoir Christ 38, fra the begining of the Kingdome 233, and Rang 19 Yeers. Howsone he was installed in his Throne, He was the first, that sought this Subjects Oathe; Into his Castell called Beregone, Of thair Alleageance, Loialtie and Trothe: Yit laugh-ful wes, and loving his Desire But purpose by plane Power to Impire. HIS Life he led, conforme unto the Law, He woundit Vice, and Vertue he advanc't: He lov'de his Lords, and yet held them in aw, All Knaverie he correctit as it chaunc't: And never yit the great Trespassour spair'd, Nor left the wise and worthie but Rewaird. HE did supplie and help the Poor-mans Harmes, Support the Pights and beat the Britons bold: And so he was both excellent in Armes, (As wes his Princelie Predicessors old) And into Peace and Government to None, (To be postpon'd) preceiding him and gone. Bastard Gillus 13?? King, Rang befoir Christ 109, fra the begining of the Kingdome 252, and Rang 2 Yeers. A bloodie Beast, who be his Fraude and Force, With EWIN's Goods, unto the Throne attanes: Which got with Wrong, he hes Governed worse, And gave, to Rancor and his Rage, the Raines: For on the Prince Posteritie he praies, And under Trust, two Innocents Betraies. BUT look how for his Levdness at the lengthe, Th'Estates concludes, and err he knew Inclosde Him in Dunstaffage, his esteemed Strengthe, And thair him from all Princelie Pow'r depos'd: But he escapes, and is to Ireland hounded, Whair he is follow'd, Foughten and Confounded. Ewin II. 14?? King, Rang befoir Christ 77, fra the begining of the Kingdome 254, and Rang 17 Yeers. The Hebrid Iles, that with Debaites abounded, My Powar pacified, and pat to Rest: And Balus that his Easterne Orchards hounded, To Sack and Spoile my Province, I Represt: In fine, himselfe I urg'd and straited so, That he became his proper Burreo. THEN when I had those Orcadens subdew'd, And Balus Bands disperst and put to Chace, And Fedracie with Nightbours I Renew'd, And then my Principalitie and Place: To EDERE DURSTUS NEPOT I dimitt, The neirest Heire and laughful Lord of it. Eder, 15?? King, Rang befoir Christ 60, fra the begining of the Kingdome 271, and Rang 48 Yeers. Through marvallous and maine Perrills past, Preserv'd be secret Powars it appeer'd: Calamities orecum he cam at last, And worthlie the Roiall State he steer'd: Ane Excellent, a Stout and Prudent Prence At Home the Hope, a Fielde the firm Defence. TH'unquiet Iylls yit boasting to rebell He boldlie beats, and to obedience brings: And prudentlie with Powar did propell From his, Incursions of the Nighbour King's. So, as of CÃ¦sar, weel of EDER, than, It might be said, he Went, he View'd, he Wan. Ewin III. 16?? King, Rang befoir Christ 12, fra the begining of the Kingdome 319, and Rang 7 Yeers. How far deflecting from his Father's forme, (A continent and uncorrupted King) His leachrous Son lievde lawless and enorm, And proov'de a Pump, Ponde and polluted Spring. Of sensual and every other kynd Of loathsome Lust, that filthy Flesh can fynd. A HUNDREDTH Hours, seems insufficient, Most horrible and inhumane to heir His carnal Concupiscence to content, Whairby his Disposition did appear: Detestable, and Doggish into that Oft surfetting, yit never saciat. WHO ever red of suche a monstrous Man Who monstrously, maid many monstrous Lawes: Which manie Yeers, nor Skill nor Cvning can Get abrogate, suche Sinne, so sweetlie schawes: Yet Vertue once, purg'd of those Lawes this Land, And he in blood, deit by a childish Hand. Metellane, 17?? King, Rang befoir Christ 14, frome the begining of the Kingdome 326, and Rang 39 Yeers. A humble Prince, Just, Merciful and Meek, Preast to repaire, Abuse born with befoir; And all his Time most seriouslie did seeke, All notabill Enormities, to smoir: This happie Prince, in all blot that was then, Resisted by Lewde and Licentious Men. YIT still those Laws of Lust he dissallowed, And punish'de Vice, Impietie and Wrong: Notorious and sensual Sinns h' eschewed, And when the World, had Rest all where, he Rang. More fortunate, nor anie King beforne For in his Days, the great King Christ was borne. Caratack, 18?? King, Rang the 35 Yeer of Christ, fra the begining of the Kingdome 365, and Rang 20 Yeers. This painful Prince, Adwentrous and Wise, (If fortunate,) most full of Fortitude: The Romans Pride and Power did despise And thair Attempts with stoutness still withstood: Whill Treacherie in Trust that oftimes stands Betraide, and puts him in Ostorious hands. CARRIED to Rome, betraied, not o'rethrown, Whair greater grew the Greatness of his Glorie; Thair, for a King of Courage, he was knowne, And so renouned in the Roman Storie. Tane as a Foe returned as a Frend, At Home, with Honour had a happie End. Corbred, 19?? King, Rang the 55 Yeer of Christ, fra the begining of the Kingdome 385, and Rang 18 Yeers. This Knightly CORBRED to the Crown elected, His Ilanders unquiet, fierce and bold; Rebelling then Couragiouslie Corrected And all their Courses, crossed and controld: Justiciars and Good Men he regarded, And Villanous, ay as they wrong'd, Rewarded. THE Romans, Robbers of all wthers Right, And whilst they Rang, the Conquerors of Kings; They fand his Force and Furie in the Fight Thought Fates, from Him, to Thame th'Advantage Vrings: His provess yit, so stout a part it playes, That he in Peace did leave his leatter Dayes. Dardan, the Gross, 20?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 72, fra the begining of the Kingdome 402, and Rang 4 Yeers. Whill honestlie this Hipocreit behav'd, And bure himselfe, or like a Lamb did looke: A good Conceat his Countrie hes conceav'd But lo the same, it suddantly forsooke: When Nero like, regardless he did rin, And sank himself in ev'ry sort of Sinne. TO Traittors, all his Treasure he betaks And robs his rich Men of thair righteous Goods: Amongs his great Men Martyrdom he macks; And cannot be contented but thair Bloods: Bot seeking to Erute the Roial Seed, He's slain and syne dishonor'd, being deed. Corbred II. Sir-named Gald, 21?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 76, fra the begining of the Kingdome 406, and Rang 35 Years. Incomparable, thou Great &amp; Gallant GALD, Prudent in Peace, and Valerous in Warre: Of th'Ylanders, thou forced for to fald, Such as deboir'd from thy Obedience darre: Thy State-effairs, with Forton fair th'effect's, And some bad Laws, abolishes and brecks. VICTORIOUSLIE with Valour oft Thou Wan, When in the Fielde with Roman Force thou fought; Thou dreave thame from thy Merches ev'rie Man And lastlie Brockin, to this Bay them brought: To pray for Peace, to thy Triumphant Troupe, And to thy Terror-striking-Standard stoup. Luctack, 22? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 110, fra the begining of the Kingdome 440, and Rang 3 Yeers. Degener'd muche, frome his Forgoers Graces, A leacher Luctack, most polluted prooves: All kinde of Lawes he flouted and defaces, Martyrs the Best, and Murderers promoves: Incestuous and for his Vices hated, As Galdus gone, was by Goode regrated. WITH Tigirish Hairte and with a Tyrans Hand, For greed of Geer, his Princes Blood he spilles: The loathsome Loade and Leproase' of the Land, With Infamie the Air h' inflicts and fills: But in effecting of his foullest Facts, A bloodie End this matchless Monarch macks. Mogald, 23? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 113, fra the begining of the Kingdome 443, and Rang 36 Yeers. A prince right stout, he studied to restoir, And to the pristine Dignitie reduce; What, LUCTAK leude, confouded haid befoir And brought into, abhominable Abuse: And then the Romans in a famous Fight, He has defaited by his Martial Might. BOT new-bred Vice his old-born Virtues banish'd, And he to all Uncleannes did decline: His vounted Vertues and his Valor Vanish'd, And then profest all Filthines in Fin: Yet such an End he suffered and receav'd, As his Deserts were worthie of and crav'd. Conar, 24?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 149, fra the begining of the Kingdome 479, Rang 14 Yeers. Severus Wall or Adrians some say, King CONAR unabschedly did brack: Thair furneish'd Forts and Forces did effray, And in their Tents no little Terror strack: This active Prince praise worthie was, had nought His Vices vrong'd the virtuous Warks he wrought. BOT Luxurie, and many other Ill, And unto all Debosherie a Desire, The Graces good unto this King did kill, And to the Prison pull'd him from Impire. Where he with shame and sorrow did consoume, Whill ARGADUS Regented in his Rowm. Ethod, 25?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 163, fra the begining of the Kingdome 493, and Rang 33 Yeers. Th' unquiet Ylls, to Insurrection us'd ETHODIUS to danton him addresses, And no Pains spair'd, no Forton he refus'd, Whill all thair Pride and Powar he represses. Thair sawadgness, foul Formes and Feritie, He salv'd with Sharpness and Severitie. TO fight his Foes he on no Perrill panc'd, And muche the Roman Powars he Impair'd: The Worthie, Wise and Vertuouss he advanc'd, And muche to cross State-comberers he cair'd: A Judge seveir and yet a clement King He wes in all his Regiment and Regne. Satrahell, 26?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 195, fra the begining of the Kingdome 525, and Rang 4 Yeers. King SATRAHELL when be immodrat Meens He sought t'assure the Scepter in his Seed: Made them his Foes that were befoir his Freens, And great Disgrace hes gained for his Greed: His Nobles all, this his Ambitioun haites, So stood ill stirrde, the Kingdome and Estaites. THIS Hate breeds Harme, and much Commotion macks, The King commands be Furie and be Force: Whairby the Bulwark of Obedience bracks, And what wes well is verted into Worss: But lo! thir Broills the Crown and Countrie herries, And in thame too, the Prince dispatch'd dois perreis. Donald the I. 27?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 199, fra the begining of the Kingdome 529, Rang 18 Yeers. Thrise Happie, that the Lord to thee allots (A Benefite above Beleef) to be, The first commanding King above the SCOTS Converted into Christianetie: Which constantlie thou studied to extend And propogat, unto thy Lives End, THOU, gratious Prince, with Gravetie, govern'd, Yet magnanime and full of martiall Might: For to secure and saiff all that concern'd Thy Countries State, againes thy Foes in Fight: The Romans felt, that oft bereft thy Rest, What Boldness born was in thy baptiz'd Brest. Ethod the II. 28?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 216, fra the begining of the Kingdome 546, and Rang 16 Years. A spritles Prence, a Man without a Mind Incapable of such a Prencelie Place: (As never came of anie Kingly Kind) He had no Pairt to proove his Roiall Race: And yet to hoord up Substance he Essayes, By villanous and manie wicked Wayes. WHEREFORE th'Estaits to help thair Losses large, With Approbatioun, they this Prince deposde: And took thameself the Governement and Charge, When he was once incarcerate and closde. Whair for his Goods and his ungodlie Gaine, His Guardians, this pusill Prince hes slain. Athirco, 29?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 231, fra the begining of the Kingdome 561, and Rang 12 Years. This Prince in his Promotion did appeer, Enritch'd with Guifts and Roiall Graces rare: Bot soon this Doubt dissolv'd, this Cloud did cleer, And they as vaine, evanish'd with the Aere: And he became both brutish and Prophane, Unto all Kings, and to thair States, a Staine. LIKE Floods renforc'd, in Ribaldrie he rag'd, A filthie Beast, effeminate, deflour'd, Unlaughfullie the Young Ones and the Aig'd, And forcibly the honestest behour'd: But lo, the Lord upon this Tirran tacks Revenge, and he himself the Murder macks. Nathalack, 30?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 242, fra the begining of the Kingdome 572, and Rang 11 Yeers. A cruell King, be Craft and be Constrent (Nought of the Blood) unto the Kingdome claime: And got in Schoe his Senators Consent Who in thair Hearts did disallow the same: For they his Platts and Policie suspect, The whilk in Fine they fand into Effect. IN monstruous Sins, without all Faith he fell, To Witches then and Sorcerers he send, Who could be Cunning (as he took it) tell How both his Life and Regiment should End: He should be slaine, they to his Servand schew, And be the same it after tryed Trew. Findock, 31??. King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 253, fra the begining of the Kingdome 583, and Rang 11 Yeers. Disposed well, with all accomplesh'd Parts This Prince had Prudence, Fortitude and Faeth: Which drew to him, and did exhale the Harts Of all that right Respect to Honor haeth: Of Graces Store, with great and godlie Guifts Above the Clouds, King FINDOCKS Laude uplifts. WITH awfull Arms he daunts the Donaldanes, And drowns the Flames of that Seditious Fire: With Courage and with Knowledge he contanes In pleasant Peace, all Partes of his Empire: Yet he, whom Valour never circumveen'd, Is falselie murdered by a secret Freind. Donald, the II. 32?. King, Rang the 264 Yeer of Christ, fra the begining of the Kingdome 594, and Rang 1 Yeer. A pregnant Prence and of a Stomak strong With changing Chance, that oft unstabill stands: Resisting Force, and in revenging Wrong, Wnhappilie fell in rebellious Hands: A Fortune far repugnant to the Merite, Of his Heroick and his Princelie Sperite. NO Martial Might but Multitude of Men, No honest Warrs, nor any Prowess plaine O'recame this Knightly King: how and what then Suppris'd unvarrs, not vanquished nor slain; And yet how soone his owne Constraint he sees, Subdu'd with Dolor he depairts and dies. Donald the III. 33? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 265, fra the begining of the Kingdome 595, and Rang 12 Yeers. Most truculent and tirranouse the Time, Before he rest and did usurpe the Regne, Contaminate with manie cruell Crime, And so unworthy to be call'd a King. A Persecuter of the Prence before, Did then the Peers and Plebeans devore. HIS Mind still mus'de on Murder and Mischeef, Ay fraught with Feare for many foul Offence, Tormented for his Guiltiness with Greef, And gnawing of a corrupt Conscience. Whill CRATHALINT with an vindictive Hand, From his Oppression did releive the Land. Crathalint, 34?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 265, fra the begining of the Kingdome 607, and Rang 24 Yeers. This civill Prence, religious and good, A fatal Foe, unto all Feritie: First boldlie took a beastlie Tirran's Blood, And next dispatched his Posteritie: Then he for Wise and Men of Courage cairs, For to be Judges in his Countr' Effairs. BOT whill he hounting his Contentment taks, The Pights thay bred (bot for a Beast) Debait: Which much Mischief and manie Murders maks, That troubled thairs, and efter this Estait: Yet Wisdom stayit, and did restrane this Strife: And then he led Religious-like his Life. Fincormack, 35?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 301, fra the begining of the Kingdome 631, and Rang 47 Yeers. A spritfull Prence, illustreous in Armes: Defate the Rage of Romans in his Ire: He hap'lie helpit all Octavius Harmes, And that perpetuate to his Empire: Which CRATHALINT his Fortone got before, Bot by his Martiall Means secured more. TH'afflicted and confined Christeane, (So much this Prince did Pietie respect:) Be that most monstrous Man Domitiane, He be his Prencelie Powar did protect: And yet th'illustreous Prince his Storie sayes, He past in Peace, and leiv'de his laitter Dayes. Romack, 36?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 348, fra the begining of the Kingdome 678, and Rang 3 Yeers. Be Pictish Strength he strove for the Estate, Acquir'd with Wrong, did wickedly governe: Envy to Armes, he adds to Blood Debate, To make the Troubles of his Time eterne: Yet faultie he, his futur Fall so fears, That in Exile he hounds the Roiall Heyres. THE fained Face of Justice he did schaw, And did pretend to play the prudent Prence: Yet sacrafeiz'd his Lords without a Law, And wasted all Things with his Violence: He th'Earthlie did, and Pow'rs Divine dispise, In Pentland slane, thairfore condignely dies. Angusean, 37?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 321, fra the beginning of the Kingdome 681, and Rang 3 Yeers. At Rest the Realme, put from King ROMACK's Rage The Regne by Right got this ANGUSEANE: Prone unto Peace, and singularlie sage, A Martiall yet, and mightie Myndit Man: Not raschelie rais'd, bot justlie if commov'd His Patience, implacable it prov'd. THE Pights, throw Pride, they did perturbe his Peace, Whom he was loath to fight withall: bot when Refused was the Offer of his Grace: H' orecam thair King, and manie of thair Men: They nought content with this, would fight againe, Whair much was lost, &amp; both the Kings war slaine. Fethelmack, 38?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 354, fra the begining of the Kingdome 684, and Rang 3 Yeers. King FETHELMACK prepairde vpoun the Pights The Prence his Daeth and wther Vrongs t'avenge Thair King he slayes, defates with whome he fights, And all from thair Incursiones does Clenge: Whereby he bett, and thame o'resett so sore, That thay thairafter Match with him no more. WHEN force did faell, than they to fraud did flit, What Might may not, by subtill Meanes thay mint: And great effects, thair fell and followes It, For lo the Prence, thus be thair Traens wes tint: A constant King, that never had declin'de From the Conditiones of a Kinglie kinde. Eugenius the I. 39?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 357, fra the begining of the Kingdome 687, and Rang 3 Yeers. With confident and with a furious Force, The Romans, Brittons, and the Pights conspire: T'eradicat, but Mercie or Remorss, And pull from thee a long preserv'd Impire: And have (thy Name) but Fauor in thair Furie, All banded, in Oblivioun, to burie. YET fearslie fought, thou with those Fureis fell, And all thair Strength, so stoupified and straitts: That they amaz'd, doubt more with thee to mell, Whill nought thair Force, but thy vnfreindly Fates O'rewhelm'd thee fightand with thy hardie Host, Whairby all lay, and looked as if lost. Fergus the II. 40?? King, The second Restorer of the Kingdome. Rang the Yeer of Christ 404, fra the begining of the Kingdome 734, and Rang 16 Yeers. Most peerles Prence, all Things defac'd thou fand, Thy Subjects slaine, and all thy Cities sack'd: By Fates and Foes, depopulat the Land, (Wofull to view) all wasted, vrong'd, and wrack'd: Yet all thow to the former State restoir'd, That ruin'd wes, and Rage of Warre devoird. THOU the renowned Romanes pat to rowt, And thame constraind for Terror Trues to tak: With strengthie strokes, and with a Stomack stowt, Thrise in thrie fights, the Britons bold thow brak: The Danow, Poo, the Rhene, and Rhodanus, Haue hard, and knew, thy Virtue Valorus. THE fates proov'de Friends, to stable the Estates, When Fergus first, the Crowne together grost: Bot thow, againes both Fortune, and the Fates, Beconquest IT, deserted, left, and lost: And spent thy Sprit, to thy Immortal Fame, Into the Knightlie Conquess of the same. Eugenius II. 41?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 420, fra the begining of the Kingdome 750, and Rang 32 Yeers. A prudent Prince in Peace, a Wise in Warre, Deforc't all Foes, the Peace preserv'd with Pights: The Britons strest, and took thame Tributarr, And be Conduct of Grahame, and gallant Knights: The vondrous Walls, that then our Nation noyit, The Keepars kill'd, he dang doune and destroyit. WHAT Fergus last, with Providence did plant, With Policie and Powar he perfects: Then in his Throne, but truble Triumphant, In Rest his Realme, he ruleth and directs: The Germane-Saxons and the Cimbre rood, He valeantlie all thair Attempts withstood. Dongard, 42?. King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 451, fra the beginning of the Kingdome 781, and Rang 5 Yeers. In Counsall quick, a Prince in fight but feare, Dispos'd to Peace, yet bold, and Bellicall: Wnto his Brothers Seat, succeeds, and Heire, Is to his Valor and his Virtues all: In Peace provides for Varre, the word advances, And stuffs his Strengths, for after-coming chances. HIS Tributars, the Britons thay Rebell, With Constantine, come to relieve thair Thrall: His cutting Sword, thair Courage yet doth quell, Thought too too fierslie fighting he did fall: To him, and his, that Days great Glorie goes: Yet dearlie bought, both unto Friends and Foes. Constantine the I. 43? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 475, fra the begining of the Kingdome 787, and Rang 22 Yeers. A wicked King, be nather Facts nor Fame, For Vertue Noble, Notted nor Renound: A sensual Sott, to his Auncestors shame Addicted unto Dronkennes: and Dround: (As can not be reported) into Pleasure, Immodestlie, but any Meane or Measure. THE Britons Bonde, he like a fool has fred, Without adwise, or wote of wiser Witts: Restorde thair Strengths, that stood his State in sted, And careleslie, all Crueltie commits: But this his Life, in Pleasure spent profane, It made an End, in punishment and paine. Congall, 44?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 479, fra the begining of the Kingdome 809, and Rang 22 Years.

THE bloodie Britons, and the Saxons set, To stress thy State, ay as thair Greatnes grew: Those gallantlie thou in two Battels bet, And then of thir, thou many thousands slew: Preserv'd thy Crowne, from forder thair offences, Then Livde and Deit a Paterne unto Prences. Goran, 45?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 501, fra the begining of the Kingdome 831, and Rang 34 Years. For Justice great, for Wisdome and for Worthe, This Noble Prince, is not the least nor last: Of virtuoss Kings, Renovned in the Northe, For to be plac'd, and but his Praiss, be past: With Pow're and Prudence, Roborate his Lawes, And so himself, a scharpe Justiciare schawes. HE with the Pights, and Britons bold did band, For Saxons sake, he made his Foes his Friends: Then with Heroick Hardines of hand, Defate and shamde, thame home to Saxon sends: And yet at home, O plague, he be his owne, Betray'de in Trust, is Murdred and o'rethrowne. Eugenius the III. 46?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 335, fra the begining of the Kingdome 865, and Rang 23 Yeers. This Just, most Careful, and Couragious King, Too raschlie some of Pariceede suspects: And yet his Life, his Good and Godlie Reigne, From the imputed Pariceede protects: Such schew his Faeth, and 's Actions exellent, That he, is known, and counted Innocent. THE Saxon-Seed he mightelie molests, Aganes the Britons he the Pights supplies: And in the fields, thair Forces he infefts; Whair both King Mordred and King Arthur dies: In Peace and Warre, he prompt and prudent prov'd, Fear'd of the Bad, and of the Best beloved. Congal the II. 47?? King, Rang the 558 Yeer of Christ, fra the begining of the Kingdome 888, and Rang 11 Yeers. A zealous Prince, Religious and Wise, Most Pitieful, most Provident and Just, His panes, to Peace and Pietie, applyes, Insuperable, with Awarice and Lust: Faeth and Religion in his Land no les, Nor plenteous Peace, did be his Care, incres. HE bounteouslie vponn the Church bestowde, He Pastors, Priests and Preachors did promove: Offences that his Countries Face o'reflow'de, He did reforme, more (than with Lawes) be love: And, as his Priests, led als austere his Life, Frie from Intestine, and all wther Strife. Kinnatell, 48?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 569, fra the begining of the Kingdome 899, and Rang 1 Yeer. This Prince by old, Experience expert, (When nought a King) with manie change of things: Was worthie and deserv'de to be insert, Enroll'd and booked with the best of Kings: Altho the Fates, so doing, did him wrong, Allow't him nought to Guide nor Gowerne long. HE willingly, and uncompelde deposde, And set himself beside the Roial Seat: And unto Aidan (invardlie reiosde) Resignde the whole Constructionn of the State. And vnperturbed in a priuate Place, He died, and departed into Peace. Aidan, 49?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 570, fra the begining of the Kingdome 900, and Rang 35 Yeers. The good of him, that many Signes presaigde, And nottable denunced in his Name: He nather yet a Young Man nor an Aigde, Did dissappoint th'assureance of the same: Bot to his Honor, and his greater Glore, He hes accomplish'd and performed more. THE Saxons that, to overthrow him thrists, His nighbour Pights, to Warre on him inveits: Bot scharplie he, all thair Assaults resists, And Hostill Mints, with Martial Might he meits: So like a Prince, as Valorous, so Wise, His People in Peace, he Governs whill he dyes. Kenneth the I. 50?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 605, fra the begining of the Kingdome 939, and Rang 1 Yeer. Not like a Prince, bot like a Prisoner, Or an Immurde, among Monastick Men: Thow seldome to thy People did appear, And when thow did, thow had no doing then; That worthie wes, to blek a Book, or be, Penn'd and presented to Posteritie. IF suche as leivs and lurks, leivs well, then thou, A happie Prence, hes and a blissed bene: For mongst the Numbers of our Nobles now, Alone Thou lurkt, and was the latent ane: Yet better lurk, nor be levd Life, to leave, A Record of Disgrace vponn the Grave.

HIS banish'd Foes, he pleasantlie recepts, Though they were Hethnish Worshippers of gods: Taught thame the Trueth, and tenderlie Intreats, O're Tirrannie, Triumphantlie he trode. And all his owne State-crosses he conjures, The common Weell, from Cumber, so secures. Ferchard the I. 52? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 621, fra the begining of the Kingdome 951, and Rang 12 Yeers.

THE Peoples plague, the poisone of the Peers, The Perditor, and Pest of all Empires: Most like a Devile, dispairdlie, Domineer's, And all the Land, with Tirranie attires: Bot mark, this Tirrane, torture dois attend, His brutish Life, bred him a beastlie End. Donald IV. 53? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 632, fra the begining of the Kingdome 962, and Rang 14 Yeers.

INTO his Bounds, h' abolishes abuses, And Justefies, all the Injurious: North-humber-Saxons, to the Faeth, h' adduces, A naughtie Nation, fierce and furious: O worthie Prince, lost by a meer Mischance, Thy Deeds deserve, a deir Remembrance. Ferchard II. 54?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 646, fra the beginning of the Kingdome 976, and Rang 18 Yeers.

CURST for those Crimes, he but Remorse remaind, Impenitent, all proudly he Opprest: Bot by a Visitation straunge, constraind, He come to knowledge, and his Faults confest: Whill yet in him, his Wickedness and Vice, Is punish't with, devoreing Wormes and Lice. Maledvine, 55?? King, Rang the 664 Yeer of Christ, fra the begining of the Kingdome 994, and Rang 20 Yeers.

HIS Nighbours thus, to Reason framed conforme, His States thay strive, and greatlie then disgrees: Yet with his Trident he did stay that Storme, And suages soone, the swelling of those Sees; Forc't by no Foes, but in his bosome lyes, Whairby this Daunter of Misdoers dyes. Eugenius V. 56?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 684, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1014, and Rang 4 Yeers.

TH'insulting Saxones, brakers of thare Trues Be Prudencie, and Provess in the Plane: (Tho' Pights disperst) he dantones, and subdues, And then, thair faithless cruell King, hes slane; And so Triumphant, ov're the Pights, and thame, In peace possest, to deathe, his Diadem.

In Albion are strange and stupendious things, Seene in his Time, all ill presageing signs. Ambirkilleth, 58?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 697, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1027, and Rang 2 Yeers. This King before he come vnto the Crowne, Appeer'd profest Protector of the Poor: Bot O how sone, into the Seat set down, He does that Goode, and calling Just, abjure: And then into, all filthines does fall, Drownd into Lust, marrs and mischieveth all. BOT now the Pights, by his ill rewled Regne, To truble his State, as fit, this time, they tak: And in his bounds, thare bloodie Bands they bring, With violence, all to devoure, and wrak: Bot lo, he sees no Issue of those Ills, For in his Campe, one yet unknowne, him Kills.

REBELLIOUS Bane, the Captain of Kintire, He does Debell, and in Subjection bring, That by a vane Presumption did aspire, Wnlaughfullie for to become a King.

Forgetful quite, of his Awncestors all, And of himself, more sensles as it seems: H' in greater faults, and filthines did fall, Nor goodlie can, be publishd or expreem'd: This fleshlie Prince, that nought his place respects, His Lieges with, his filthines infects. YET forst to fight, aganes the English Armes, Once with good fortune did their Pow're Repell: Bot lo this Luck, the Victor Host more harmes, Then thame Defaited in the field that fell: His Companies, with Courage overcame, Bot nather could nor wold, he vse the same.

THE Cimber-Danes drawne heir into his dayes, Dispoilde his Poore, depopulate his Lands: Yet he thair furie, with distruction stayes, Ay whill himselfe, fell in thair Hethnish hand: And shortlie slane, by Sauadgnes of sum, By him befoir, Commanded, and o'recum.

HE batters Berwick, and that Toune he taks, And th'Ireland Force, that did afflict his Fields: (Sought throw the Seas) this Bellicose, he braks, Whill Dubline danger'd, to his mercie yeelds: The King, and Croune, in his protectionn put, And Concord bot, as he commands, wes knut.

ANE Danishe flott, out of his Deephs he drave, How soone thair coming, to his Coast was knowne: He th'Englishe aides, that his Concurrenss craves, And punishes, all uproars of his owne: Trivmphant then, Redoubted, and Renovnd, Hee rests decoird, and with the Lawrell Cround. Constantine the III. 75?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 904, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1234, and Rang 40 Yeers.

THIS Friendschip fond, confermed with a foe, Bot waiting vauntage, to revolt and change: Brought Britone Varrs, they brought with thame thair Voe, A foull Defaitt, and vonderful Revenge: Whill to lament, the largenes of this loss, His Croune, he with, a frierish Coull, did coss. Malcolme I. 76?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 943, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1273, and Rang 9 Yeers. A prince whose Virtue, famous made his Facts, His Territors, he but a stroake extends: All Bands with Danes, h' abolishes and bracks, And Englishmen, of Foes, he made his Friends: So Fortone flows, her Gloab, so rolling goes, That now, new Friends, prove now, anone, new foes. IN the English aide, he does the Danes defait, Without respect, or sparing of his Panes: He castigates, and with correctionn strait, His Countries youth, from rage, of Error Ranes: And yet this good King, Ministring his Laws, His Throat got cutted for his Justice caus. Indulph, 77?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 952, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1282, and Rang 9 Yeers.

THARE Landing long, I letted whill at last, Be fraudulent, a fals, and faingzeit flight: They come to Colene, and there Anchors cast, Where I perforce, defate thame in a Fight: Bot too too bold, without my Bands, or Bak, Adventring valiantlie, I went to Wrak. Duffus, 78?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 961, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1291, and Rang 5 Yeers.

HE th'insolent, and wantone Vagabounds, To tak thame too a Calling, does constrane: Or punished, or banished thame his bounds, Whill savagelie, in secreit he is slane: And yet behold, continuall Darkness did, Mak manifest, his horrid Murder hid. Cullen, 79?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 966, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1296, and Rang 4 Yeers. This Princelie Parte, allone my Spr'ite possest, That I the Countrie from King-killars clengde: And so that Donald with his Doers drest, That worthelie, I Duffus wrong Revengde: Bot no mo princelie Properties hade I, To guard me from a greatter Infamie. FOR all the Ills, that could infect the fleshe, A World of Vice, all sort of sensual Sinne: Bvt offring once, vnto my Brest a Breshe, I Greedilie, both sought, and soukit In: Which so polluts, my Persone, and my Sperit, And maid me last, be Murdered for my Merit. Kenneth III. 80?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 970, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1300, and Rang 24 Yeers.

AT Loncartie he did destroy the Danes, There where the Hayes thair first great Honor had: His Kingdome he, in Concord all Contanes, And did vndoe, thame that Rebellione Bred: Bot yet a Womans Witt, (the waikest thing,) Confounds with cvnning this courageous King. Constantine IV. 81?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 994, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1324, and Rang 2 Yeers. As blind Ambition, did induce Desire, And causde him crave, and covet to be Cround: So Petitors, did punische his Empire, And it (divided) in distructionn drounde: Plague, Famen, Force, (this Realme thus Raizde and Rent,) Vnhappie Prince, his People, both spoilde, &amp; spent. IN this Intesteine, and no straunger Strife, There Countrie Friends, wes to thare furie Food: No Straunger, nor, Outlandishe, lost his Life, Nor then wes sched, a Dane, nor Britons Blood: No all wes thares, and thairfor Justlie all, Both King, and Clamers, for thair Faults did fall. Grimmus, 82? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 996, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1326, and Rang 8 Yeers. A martial Mind, placde in a Person Strong, A pleasant Prince, and liberall no less: By Argadus, his godlie Labors long, Contendants quarrels, for the Croune, quiesce: And he his time, at ease in pleasure past, Whill those Delights, lost him his Life, at last. HIS idle Life, allurde him wnto Lust, Deflecting frome his former Faschionnes All: He is become, Injurious and Unjust, And onlie, to his thriftles Thoughts, is thrall: Whill Malcolme Kenneths Sone, this Tirane taks: (His Eyes puld out,) then like a Wretche he wraks. Malcolmus II. 83? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 1004, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1334, and Rang 30 Yeers.

THRICE in thrie Fights, the Danes defated fled, And left vnto, his Victor Force, the fielde: He in thair Blood thrice boldlie bath'd his Bleid, And thrise orethrowne, they to his Mercie yeild: And forc'd, be Battel right and bloodie wounds, To rander (Rest) all his Foirbears Bounds. NO Prince preceeding, past, before his dayes, For Policie, nor Maters Martiall: More worthelie, depostulats a Praise, Had not his greedines disgraced all: Which in his Age, S' insatiat did schoe, Whill he at Glamms, fell for his Countrie foe. Duncane I. 84?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 1034, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1364, and Rang 6 Yeers. A knightlie King, whill he his Isles corrects, The spightfull Danes, to spoill him of Empire: Cam on his Coasts, and thairin boldlie Brecks, And where they went, all waists with Force and Fire: Bot soone thair Pride, he hes Represt, in Parte, By his Activitie in Armes and Arte. THE Sea, and Sands, the rest of Wrongs Reveng'de: And maid his Raigne, from thair Irruptionnes frie: From Forraigne Foes, his Countrie he hes Clengde, Bot could not from Cognat Enemie, Relieve his Life, that looked like a Friend: Bot proovde a Foe, and Murdred him in End. Mackbeth, 85?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 1040, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1370, and Rang 17 Years. His cowsing King, he Murdred and Betrayed, So caught the Crowne, &amp; thus his Greatnes got: And yet eschamde, vncessanntlie Essayed, To burie in Obliuionn that Bloot: By well Governing, and by holsome Lawes, Some little signes of satisfactionn schawes. BOT Nurture, Nature past, and he, Repents, His good, and to his vomited vomeit turns: He slayes the saikles, and the Innocents, And still his Brest, for blood it boills and burns: Blood wes the Schott, and Butt of his Desires, By blood he came, by blood his Spirit Expires. Malcolme Canmore, 86?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 1057, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1387, and Rang 36 Yeers. A prince whose Valore, did his Visdome war, And yet his Witts, his Courage did decore: His Wit and Valore still Companions ar, This followed fast, when the wther went before: Both Witt and Valor, in this King concurres, To preache his Praise, in stabled State, and Sturrs. THE Spiritual he, Promotes, and he Reproves, Intemperance, and all Excessiue Diot: He measurs by Example and Remowes, Be practeisd Precepts, from his Realme, all Riot: The Cursed Lawes, that cursd King Ewne, proclamde, He Cancellat, Annvlled, and Condamnde. FOUR Times he fought, and four times foild his Foes, Four times Trivmphde, and four times on his Tresses: A Glorious quadruplet Garland goes, And four times too, home-bred vproars, Represses: Yet this Trivmphant, by a Traittour trusted, In desp'rat forme, out through the head is thrusted. Donald Bane VII. 87?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 1093, fra the beginning of the Kingdome 1423, and Rang 1 Yeer.

BOT Violence and Wrong a Varrand wants, For what he haid, vsurped bot of late: More puissant Powre, perverteth and supplants, And reft his Life, his Honor and Estate: Ill satled Bases, thus are brascht and schakin, And Tirranes ar, be greater strength oretakin. Duncane II. 88?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 1094, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1424, and Rang 1 Yeer. A prompt, and Pregnant Prince for Interprise, Nought Peaceable, nor of politick Spreit: More fierce in fight, nor in the Counsall Wise, And more for Mars, nor for Minerua meit: A King, that thought, no Causs decidit right, Bot onlie by, the Fortonne of a Fight. INCITED by, his Soveraigne Lords desire, Concomitat, with Companies, he Came: And did expell, th'Vsurper the Empire, And then assumde, wnto himself the same: Bot his disloiall Deeds, receavde thair due, He wes betraied, becaus he tryed vntrue. Edgare, 89?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 1098, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1428, and Rang 9 Years.

THOW double Bands, with nighbour Kings concludes, So Peace abroad, and thow at home Possesses: Religion lieves, and in her Beawtie Budes, And still abowe, all Credit it incresses: The mightie Marss, great god of Warr gewes place, To Thee the Parent, and the Prince of Peace. Alexander, called the Fierce, I. 90?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 1107, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1437, and Rang 17 Yeers.

WHO to the Church, more bountefull hes bene, He mightelie, her former Means augments: That scarce he could his Princelie State susteene, So muche diminishde he, the Roial Rents: He raised Her, to Ritches and Renoune, She Sancted him (a sore One) for the Croune.

WITH diuers Foes, This doubted had to doe; With ciuill Cummars, and Commotionnes most: In Nighbour Broills, sumtimes entangled too, And Captive tane, once by a Callide host: Yet spight of Fates, and Fortone, Foes or Friende, His Enterprises, had a happie End. HE Founded Perthe, when Taye oreflowing drounde, His building Bertha, statelie, strong and faire: He built Arbrothe, and Haddingtoune did found, And many Lands, on Prelacies did spair.

THERE Men a Land, at Larges, thay ar lost, Thair Schippes the Vinds and Waters did devore: So be two Great, calamities, thus crost, King Magnus is compelled to restore: And quite the Isles, and Boote, and Arrane left, Which laitlie Acho, but a Right, had reft. THUS by his Sworde, securde, and setled so, From Straungers stres, his Standing and Estate: He did conforme his Friends, and forst his Foe, Bot could not Frame, to his effect, his Fate: For be a Fall, He perishes, perforce, Born doune a Hewche, with an vnhandsom Horse.

WHAT Fortone did not to thy Fate Befall, A Fortunate, and most misforton's Man: And yet Thow wes, Invincible in All, No Well nor Woe, orecome thy Courage can: In spight of Foes, and of thy Fortones frowne, Thy Knight-hoode hes, Reconquished thy Crowne. THY Brethers blood, defectionn of thy Friends, Force of thy Foes, nor straightnes of thy State: The Lione-boldnes, of thy brest disbends, Nor Magnanimit' of thy Mind could Mate: Fates, Foes, and Fortone forcde, thy Spreit surpast, And wan thy selfe Victorious Lord at last. David Bruce, 98?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 1330, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1660, and Rang 40 Yeers.

THE Englishe King, tho by Connuball Bands, And Alliance, he, wnto Thee was bound; Perfidiouslie, Depopulates thy Lands, And all thy Parts, with wrongous Warrs, does wound: Thy owne Revolts, thy Fates &amp; Foes, infests Thee, And Milionnes of Miseries molests Thee. TWICE thow Exilde, and twise Returnde thow Try'de, T'awenge thy Wrongs, by Manfull Meanes and Might, Bot ay thy Weirds, thy Valour thay Invyde, And crosd thee with Misfortunes in the Fight: Yet Fortone fasht, to vex thee with all Ills, Content at last, thy Storme and Tempest stills. Eduard Baleoll, 99?? King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 1332, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1662, and Rang 40 Yeers. By Forrane Force, and by a banishd Band, Thy State vsurped, and thy Standing stood: Wnhappie Prince, thow with a Hostill hand, Bereft the Raigne due to the Bruces Blood: Thy bloodie Blade, nor Peer nor Plebane spairs, As Bervicks Fight, and Dupline Field declairs. THE Kingdom frie, (thow Traittor) did Betray, And swore thy selfe, a Slave with thy consent: Thow maide thy Countrie, to thy Pride a Pray, A Tigre-harted-Tirrane to content: Bot all for nought, thy Fathers Fate, thow fand, Disgras'de, Exilde, thow lost, and left the Land. Robert Steuart II. 100. King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 1371, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1701, and Rang 19 Years. The first King STEWART that the Croune possest, Of Bancho's Blood and of the Bruces Borne: The Roote wnto the Race, of all the Rest, That since the same most worthely hes Vorne: A Prince in whom in full Perfection Spir'd, All Royall Wirtues, whill the State he steer'd. HIS frequent Foes, that in his Precincts svarme, And this his Realme, with thair Direptions Rent: They felt the weght of his Wictorious Arme, And heard with Horror of his Hardiment: His Worth in Warre, and Policie in Peace, Him-selfe, and his, ev'r gloriously shall Grace. HIS Princely Spirit the Place, his Soul the Seat, Of Prudence, Prowes, Measure and Remors: His Mercie much, his Justice Good, as Great, His Courage Constant, kyth'd wnfring'd in Force And all his Guifts, Great, Kingly, Cardinall, The Graces better, back't and blest Them all. Robert III. 101. King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 1390, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1720, and Rang 14 Yeers. A prince for Peace, that had for Mars no Mind, Abhorring Warrs, and all Intestine Strife: Noght to be Cross'd, with Kingly Cares Inclind, Bot loving more, a calme and quiet Life: A King indeed, and yet in Sho bott sitts, For to his Brother he the Care Committs. WHO alwise on his awne Preferment panc'd, And muche more Pains on his Partic'lars spent: Nor (gif applyed well) had well adwancd, The Countries common Good and Government: Bot his Attempts, all aymed at this End, How s'ewer to, the Soveraigne Seat t'ascend. BOT this Calme King (cross'd with his Childrings Chance, Of which the Prince in Prison strait, wes starv'd: The Second sent, with safe Conduct to France, For feare at Home, So to be Shent, and Serv'd: Is tane and Intercepted on the Seas) In Silent Sorrow he Consumes and Dies. James the I. 102. King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 1406, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1736, and Rang 31 Yeers. Great Prince, thy Prudence, prowes and thy Sprit, O're reatch'd all Those, that reigned, when Thow Raigne: Thow made Thy might, with Measur'd Mercie, meet, And sharplie did, revenge Thy Subjects wrang: In time of Trues, thow wes (that Peace profainde) In England, long a Captive taen, detain'd. THE Clanns conjurde, Thow danton'd and dejects, The Altitude, of mony mightie Mindes: The Colledge, Court of Reason, Thow Erected, And Seminarie Scooles, of sindrie kindes: And th'English than, that with thair Swords, Thee shoirs, Thow Fights, Defaets, and wasts thair Territors. THY Fate, conformes, with CÃ¦sar's in thy Fall, Tho muche discordant were your Qualities: Thy Raigne but Terror, his Tyranicall, No Tyrranie Thow, tho Truculent he Tryis: Yet wrong'd alike, Both Violat, and Vounded, Lay by your fierce &amp; faethles friends confounded. James the II. 103. King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 1437, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1767, and Rang 24 Yeers. Braue Sprited Prince, Thy too too tender Yeers, Wnrype to Rule, and such a Birth, to Beare: Into Thy Stats, such Strife Intestene Steers, That It o'reflowde with Strife, with Force, with Feare: The Strong contend, yit th'Innocent and Poore, The Dolor, and, the Damnage, they indure. THE Governours, and Guiders of the States, Of greatest Poure, thy Peers and Palladines: They for thair Place of Honor other hates, Then These beleiving to brak Both, Combines: And Thee as Captive kept, betuixt These two, And all thair Doing, proves disorder so. NOUGHT by thy Fault, bot by these Princes Pride, A thowsand Ills, into thy Raigne arose: And skarsh wes stopt, the Torrent of that Tide, When it afflicted wes with forrane Foes: And thow, too neir falls, be a fattall Stroake, Gevne by a Gun that over-burden'd Bracke. James III. 104. King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 1460, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1790, and Rang 29 Yeers. A noble Prince, borne doune with Ciuil Broills, Whill th'Earth, for greatnes of his Greefe, does grone: Rage and Rebellion in the Bosome boills, Of his proud Peers, to his Perdition prone: For what Enormitie and Wrong was nought, Bot in the woodnes of these Warrs wes wrought. BASS, corrupt Counsalours, and ill Inclind, The Noble Nature of this Prince abus'd: Which bred to Men, (bot of Tumultous Mind) A fitting Means, had it beene wiselie vs'd: For to Re-Reare, that Threatned then to fall: Bot Rage in Reformation Rvines all. DISCORD, Envy, th'Intestene Suord and Fire, Rap, Sacriledge, Imprisonments and Bands: Was plainly Practiz'd in there angrie Ire, Whill that this Prince, hes perishde in thair hands. Bot this is Pitie, that his Sonne wes sought, And, bot to cloak thair bold Rebellion, brought. James IV. 105. King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 1489, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1819, and Rang 25 Yeers. A prince, of all the most Renovn'd that Ragne, Or euer Dominerd before his Dayes: A matchles Mirror, Magestrats amang, That past all Princes in this Poynt of Prais: Ne're better Justice, had the Poor Mans Cause, Nor neuer better Execute the Laws. THE prÃ¦appointed Providence Divine, By Mariage Right, decreed he should acquire: Once to the most Illustrious of his Line, (As now appears) the Southpart of th'Impire. And yet that Band, not such a Concord breeds, That could prevent the Sorrows that succeeds. IN Floddon-Feild, betwixt the Tweed and Tine, This Great King JAMES with mony Lords was lost: Inconstant Forton be a fault of Thine, An best of Kings, thare but compare wes crost: Whose Mausole, must, be all the Earth and aer, For Fame to Sing, and Circome-sound him there. James V. 106. King, Rang the Yeer of Christ 1514, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1844, and Rang 29 Yeers. A prince Seveir, Just, and exceeding Sage, To Pleasurs proan, and yet Politique Vise, Began his Regne in Morning of his Age, When all his Lands, to be lamented, lyes: Bathed in Blood, all springing from despyte, And strong Contending Factions of the Greate. WITH Storms of State, distempred still, and toss't, He made his Knoledge and his Courage knowne: With Muteneis, and with Commotions most, Of Stats-men strong, stifnecked of his owne: Yet be his Justice singular Sevear, He Chastiz'd some, and some Reform'd, for Feare. BOT never could, (tho many tims he try'd,) Deleit, the long Dislikings of his Lords: Of whom the Cheefe, what he desir'd, deny'd, And from thair bund Obedience debords: So in this worthie, thair vn-wise Envye, Made him in Merror, and in dolor Dye. Queene Marie, Rang the Yeer of Christ 1543, fra the begining of the Kingdome 1873, and Rang 16 Yeers.

HER Life, but Jarrs, her Daeth begat her Joyes, The Coyners of her Cares, her Crosses cur'd: Short Suffring soone, annulled her annoyes, And to be Crovnd, and Re-inthrond assurd: From Earth to Heaw'ne, from Prison to Repose, To spire in Paradise, up sprang this Rose. IT helped not, to be a Prince Supreame, Her Hops, tho hudge, without effecting faild: Noght cared wes, to mony Crouns her Clame, Prevaricat Opinions prewaild: Vn-Truths, ill Try'd, a Forme deform'd did find, True Maiestie, to marre and vndermind. James VI. 107. King, Rangs, and has begane his Rang in Scotland, the Yeer 1567. and over all Britan, &amp;c. the Yeer 1603. now with all Reigning this Year 1625. Wise matchles Monarch whome the World admires, And God aboue hes Beavtefied and Blest, With Plentifull, and full of Pow'r Impires, Past Reasons reatche, (and yet thy Right) with Rest: Incress thy Crouns, and with thy Courage clame, Prophaned Judas, and Jerusalem. BRING that to pass, that Pietie expects, Rise and Erotte the Errors of the East: The force of Faeth, from greater Facts effects, Nor beat doune Babell and debell the Beast: That with her Errors all the Earth enchannts, That soukis the Blood that snares and slayes the Sancts, AND since you haue all Happines from Heaven, Good Gracious King, a great and glorious Sage: In Earth all Greatnes, and all Graces gevne, Give us againe a Good and Golden Age: And mack us by the Greatnes of thy Grace, Thy Loyal Lieges Parteners of thy Peace. Henrie Frederick, Installed Prince of Wales, &amp;c. Born in the Castell of Sterling the 19. of February 1593, an Heroick Prince, departed in London at St. James, 6. Nov. 1612. The Grace, Delight, and Glorie of this Age, The Hope of all, the haut' and hardie Youth: The Atlas of the Old, Sheeld of the Sage, The vnpeerd Prince, in Guifts, in Grace, in Grouth: The Excellencie in Earth, of Earthly Things, And Quintescence of mony hundred Kings. THE Church her Cheeftan, and Republicts Treasur, The Godleis Glaidness erst, and now thair Greef: His Princelie Parents, and the Peoples Pleasure, Thrie Kingdomes Care, and thair Contentment cheef: The first borne Blessing of the best King James, Whose Worth the World, with Britans Kingdoms Fames, MORE truly Tytus, nor Vespatians Heire, More nor that Wittie Greek Vlisses Wise: More nor Hyppolit Chaist, nor Paris faire, And stout like Hector, heir Prince Henrie lyes. Scotlands Health, Englands Hope, Europs Mirror, The Popish, Spanish, and the Turkish Terror. FINIS.</field>
