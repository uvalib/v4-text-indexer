TO THE RIGHT REVERENDE FATHER IN GOD, the Right honourable and my very good Lorde, TO BIE (by the grace of God) Bishop and Counte Palatine of Duresme and Sadberge: Increase of all true zeale, honour &amp; perpetuall consolation of mind and bodye. INVOCATION To the Diuine Father of sacred Muses. Sonnet. I. [No more lewde laies of Lighter loues I sing] No more lewde laies of Lighter loues I sing, Nor teach my lustfull Muse abus'de to flie, With Sparrowes plumes and for compassion crie, To mortall beauties which no succour bring. But my Muse fethered with an Angels wing, Diuinely mounts aloft vnto the skie. Where her loues subiects with my hopes doe lie: For Cupids darts prefigurate hell's sting. His quenchlesse Torch foreshowes hell's quenchles fire, Kindling mens wits with lustfull laies of sinne: Thy wounds my Cure deare Sauiour I desire To pearce my thoughts thy fierie Cherubinne, (By kindling my desires) true zeale t'infuse, Thy loue my theame and holy Ghost my Muse. Sonnet. II. [Sweete Sauiour from whose fiuefold bleeding wound] Sweete Sauiour from whose fiuefold bleeding wound, That comfortable Antidote distilde: Which that rancke poyson hath expeld and kild, In our old wretched father Adam found. In Paradise when he desertlesse crown'd, Receau'd it as th' enuenomde Serpent willde, In steede of lustfull eyes with arrowes fillde: Of sinfull loues which from their beames abound. Let those sweete blessed wounds with streames of grace, Aboundantly sollicite my poore spirite: Rauish'de with loue of thee that didst debase Thy selfe on earth that I might heauen inherite, O blessed sweete wounds fountaines of electre, My wounded soules balme, and saluations nectre. Sonnet. III. [Sacred redeemer, let my praiers pearce] Sacred redeemer, let my praiers pearce Thine eares to contrite sinners open still At my harts altar made, where (to fulfill My vowes) I sacrifice in humble verse. Which doe with troubled penitence rehearse My ceaselesse sinnes repugnant to thy will: Let mercie mittigate the large blacke bill Of my dead sinnes: Deare iudge the doome reuerse Which with foule guilt agrieu'de my conscience gaue, By iustice iustly damn'd to quenchlesse fire: Oh my deare Sauiour crucifi'd, mee saue! Let my contricions incense vp aspire (With true zeale kindled on my Altar hart) And of thy sweete saluation purchase part. Sonnet. IIII. [Deare comforter (with whose deare precious blood] Deare comforter (with whose deare precious blood, The costly ransome of my sinnes was paide, For my redemption murthered and betraide, Sole spotlesse Lambe before the throane which stoode Opening the seuen sealde Booke: who for pure foode Thy precious selfe in sacrifice had'st laide To my soules sustenance: which had decaide If thou hadst not beene lifted on the roode) O let my soule (thy Temple) be perfum'de With sacred incense of thy vertuous grace: Which hauing with repentant sighes presum'de (Though charg'de with sinne) to kneele before thy face, Yet for like Almes (in mercy) doth implore, Though last in worke, with those which wrought before. Sonnet. V. [Blessed creatour let thine onley sonne] Blessed creatour let thine onley sonne (Sweete blossome stocke and roote of Dauids line The cleare bright morning starre) giue light and shine On my poore spirit, which hath new begunne With his loues praise and with vaine loues hath donne: to my poore Muse let him his eares incline, Thirsting to tast of that celestiall wine Whose purple streame hath our saluation wonne. O gracious bridegroome, and thricelouely bride Which come and fill who will for euer crie, Water of life to no man is deny'de: Fill still who will if any man be drye. O heauenly voice! I thirst, I thirst and come For life, with other sinners to get some. Sonnet. VI. [Pvre sacrifice, once offred for vs all] Pvre sacrifice, once offred for vs all, Euen all which were defilde with deadly sinne: Let me poore deadly sinner, who beginne With voice and hart repentant thee to call, And cry that finde my selfe about to fall Into that quenchlesse lake, repleate within With howling fiends which euer gnash and grin, Haue Audience from thy throane celestiall. Deere spotlesse sacrifice (which didst discend And as a man for mankindes safetie dy'de, And ransackt Hels foule dungeon without end: Enlarging sinners which therein were ty'de) Since thou didst die that sinners sau'de might bee, I am a wicked sinner (Lord) saue mee. Sonnet. VII. [White spotlesse Lambe (whose precious sweete bloudshed] White spotlesse Lambe (whose precious sweete bloudshed The whole worlds sinnefull Debt hath satisfied: For sinners scorn'd, whipp'de, wounded, crucified, Beholde my sinfull soule by Sathan led Euen to the gates of Hell: where will be red My consciences blacke booke: vnlesse suppli'de Be (to those leaues past number) thy wounds wide: Whose purple issue which for sinners bled, Shall wash the Register of my foule sin, And thence blot out the vile memoriall: Then let thy blessed Angell enter in My temple purg'd, and that historiall (Of my sinnes numberlesse) in deepe Seas cast: So shall I be new borne, and sau'd at last. Sonnet. VIII. [Lyon of Iudah (which dost iudge and fight] Lyon of Iudah (which dost iudge and fight With endlesse iustice, whose annointed head Was once with wounding thornes inuironed, But now with sacred Crownes by glorious right: Whose glorious hoast succeedes in armour white, Before whose face so many millions fled, And whose Imperiall name, no man could read) Illuminate my thoughts, with the beames bright Of that white powrefull and celestiall Doue: Kindle my spirit with that sacred heate, Which me may rauish with an heauenly Loue: Whil'st I thy ceaselesse graces doe repeate, Downe powrde in full aboundance to mankind, Which comfort in my soule (poore wretch) I find. Sonnet. IX. [O gracious shephearde (for thy simple flocke] O gracious shephearde (for thy simple flocke By guilefull Goates to rauening Wolues misled,) Who thine owne deare harts precious bloud didst shed, And Lambelike offered to the butchers blocke; O gracious shepheard (vnremouing rocke Of succour to such all as thither fled) Respect one of thy flocke which followed These cursed Goates, and doth repentant knocke. To be with mercy taken to thy folde, I know thy grace doth still for wanderers looke, I was a lost sheepe once (deare Lord) beholde, And in compassion take me with thy hooke: In one lost sheepe new found thou dost reioyce, Then know thy sheepe, which knowes his shepheards voice. Sonnet. X. [Heauenly Messias (sweete annointed King] Heauenly Messias (sweete annointed King, Whose glorie round about the world doth reach, Which euerie beast, plant, rocke, and riuer teach, And aerie birds like Angels euer sing, And euery gale of winde in gustes doth bring, And euery man with reason euer preach) Behold, behold that lamentable breach: Which (my distressed conscience to sting) False spitefull Sathan in my soule doth make: Oh (sweete Messias) lend some gracious oyle To cure that wound, euen for thy mercies sake: Least (by that breach) thy temple he dispoyle. Helpe, helpe, my conscience thether him doth leade, And hee will come, if thou bruse not his head. Sonnet. XI. [Mercifull Iesus thine eyeliddes of grace] Mercifull Iesus thine eyeliddes of grace Decline vnto a wicked sory sinner Humbly prostrate, who (but a new beginner) Begges that thine holy Ghost might Sathan chase From his foule soule, ordaind for thy pallace: as it did Mary Mag'daline saue, and winne her From seuen foule spirits which did raigne within her: But now behold a more contagious place, A place where the seuen mortall sinnes roote take, From whence beside all ougly crimes braunch out, With each of these seuen legions doe pertake Of vncleane spirits raging round about: Oh now deare Iesus, Iesus shew thy power, And driue them forth, least they my soule deuoure. Sonnet. XII. [Bountifull Lord Christ (whose hand liberall] Bountifull Lord Christ (whose hand liberall Is still out stretched for mans sustenance Which wee much thankelesse with small souenance recount, when in such larges it doth fall: But that which all men in especiall Ought to maintaine in high rememberance, (Naylde feete and hands, and hart pearc'de with a Launce For our redemption from the sinfull thrall) With feruent zeale, true Loue, feare reuerent, Is quite forgot of most: and yet these bee The chiefe deare signes for our saluation sent: Oh blessed Chist, bestow thy grace on mee Bestow this blessed grace (deare Christ) that I May hope new life by thy death, when I die. Sonnet. XIII. [Deare Dauids sonne (whom thy forefathers haue] Deare Dauids sonne (whom thy forefathers haue In Psalmes and prophecies vnborne foretolde, That hell in Adamantine chaines should holde, And thence poore sinners both inlarge and saue Whom former blindnes to damnation gaue) Mee swallowed in the gulfe of sinne behold: A Lambe amongst wilde wolues (once of thy fold) Whom Sathan now doth for his porcion craue: Deare sonne of Dauid helpe, yet helpe with speede. Thy wounds bleede fresh in my remembrance yet, Which blessed wounds did for offenders bleede: These wounds I will not in distresse forget, For all cheefe hope of my saluation, grounds In Nectre of those comfortable wounds. Sonnet. XIIII. [O benigne Father let my sutes ascend] O benigne Father let my sutes ascend, And please thy gracious eares from my soule sent; Euen as those sweete perfumes of incense went From our forefathers altars: who didst lend Thy nosthrils to that mirrh which they did send, Euen as I now craue thine eares to be lent. My soule, my soule, is wholy, wholy bent To doe thee condigne seruice, and amend, To flie for refuge to thy wounded brest; To sucke the balme of my saluation thence, In sweete repose to take eternall rest, As thy childe folded in thine armes defence: But then my flesh me thought (by Sathan fir'de) Said my proud sinfull soule in vaine aspirde. Sonnet. XV. [Pittifull Lord (whose endles mercy reacheth] Pittifull Lord (whose endles mercy reacheth From East to West and the worlds compasse filleth, Whose charge imperious (as thy spirit willeth) Things sencelesse as in life obedience teacheth: Whose bright omnipotence the Dumbe borne preacheth: Whose grace in full aboundance downe distilleth To contrite sinners, which olde Sathan killeth, And wounded spirits heales, whome sinne appeacheth) With those bright eyes of mercy me respect, From my soule (made thy temple) Sathan driue, That my pure spirit may thy praise detect, And from death by thy liuely grace reuiue: That (sinne and Hell suppress'd) I might appeare After deaths conquest, by thy mercies cleare. Sonnet. XVI. [Svre corner stone of that rocke firme and hie] Svre corner stone of that rocke firme and hie, (Where of eternall life the fountaine springs, Whose vertue to the soule such comfort brings That he which tasteth neuer shall be drie, Nor euer slaue of death againe shall die) Oh let thy blessed Angell carrie wings And arme my soule: which loathing earthly things For liuely water to that rocke would flie: There neuer dare approch my Ghostly foe, Which would from number of thy Saints exempt My silly soule: sweete Christ let him forgoe That deare soules purchase: which he doth attempt. Remember (my deare Lord) thou dy'd to saue it Then neuer shall the roaring Lyon haue it. Sonnet. XVII. [Mylde King of Salem Lord of louely peace] Mylde King of Salem Lord of louely peace, (Who do'st in brother like agreement ioy, In mercy mourning when thou do'st destroy, Where iustice condigne anger doth encrease) Behold a wretch, whose sinnes doe neuer cease With haynous guilt his conscience to annoy: Who by that meanes cannot calme rest enioy Behold deare Christ, and for my free release (Vpon contrition) those offences blot Out of those large inditements, which be giu'n By my iust conscience: let them be forgot. Forget, forgiue (deare Lord) for I am driu'n (By their remembrance) almost to dispaire: Which my soules ruine ready would prepare. Sonnet. XVIII. [Hye priest of Syon (whose eternall throne] Hye priest of Syon (whose eternall throne With endlesse right, and mercy seated is: Which all knees (when his name repeated is) Adore: whose rule hath times swift wings outgone, Whose Scepter is an euerlasting one, Whose Monarchie neuer compleated is) This humble Alter see, which heated is With feruent zeale I beare to thee alone: Which from the Syon of my soule aspireth, Euen from this zealous hart vnto the chayre Of euerlasting power, where it desireth (Through pleasing incense) for me to prepayre A glorious Crowne, which neuer will take rust: Which graunt (Deare Sauiour) in whose helpe I trust. Sonnet. XIX. [Louely Samaritane, draw neere, and view] Louely Samaritane, draw neere, and view The mangled obiect of a wretched soule, Afflicted deadly with a conscience foule: The iust sting of such sinnes as my soule slew, Whose faults be numberlesse though yeeres bee few. Oh note them not sweete Lord in thy blacke scroule Which may my deare saluations hope controle, When breath and body shall be changed new: But these foule desperate wounds (deare Christ) vp bind, Cherishd with oyle of mercies and sweete grace: And let thy Gospell minister each kind Of heau'nly foode, and bee thy Church the place Where I may mee repose to purchase cure, That (when thou com'st) I may be sound and pure. Sonnet. XX.

So let faith, hope and loue make ouerture Of new saluation (which themselues conceale In this base mortall stable sinnes foule place) Whereof eternall ioyes, they may present To my saluation (borne of thy deare grace) Such rich Propines: As from thy Gospell sent By precious incense may my spirit bring The tearmelesse praises of my God to sing.

Make thou my soule cleere like white Salmons snow, Or like a siluer winged Doue appeare, Where diuers glorious golden fethers show: Conuert thy foemens forces into feare, Like Iaben make them, and like Cysara, Like Seba, Zeb, Horeb and Salmana.
