      <field name="fulltext">Volume I, [Volume II] THE COUNTESSE OF PEMBROKES ARCADIA TO MY DEARE LADIE AND SISTER, THE COUNTESSE OF PEMBROKE. [THE FIRST BOOKE OF THE COUNTESSE OF PEMBROKES ARCADIA.] [What length of verse can serve brave Mopsas good to show?] What length of verse can serve brave Mopsas good to show? Whose vertues strange, &amp; beuties such, as no m? th? may know Thus shrewdly burdned th?, how c? my Muse escape? The gods must help, and pretious things must serve to shew her shape. Like great god Saturn faire, and like faire Venus chaste: As smothe as Pan, as Juno milde, like goddesse Iris faste. With Cupid she fore-sees, and goes god Vulcans pace: And for a tast of all these gifts, she steales god Momus grace. Her forhead jacinth like, her cheekes of opall hue, Her twinkling eies bedeckt with pearle, her lips as Saphir blew: Her haire like Crapal-stone; her mouth O heavenly wyde; Her skin like burnisht gold, her hands like silver ure untryde. As for her parts unknowne, which hidden sure are best: Happie be they which well beleeve, &amp; never seeke the rest. [Transformd in shew, but more transformd in minde] [Pyrocles.] Transformd in shew, but more transformd in minde, I cease to strive with double conquest foild: For (woe is me) my powers all I finde With outward force, and inward treason spoild. For from without came to mine eyes the blowe, Whereto mine inward thoughts did faintly yeeld; Both these conspird poore Reasons overthrowe; False in my selfe, thus have I lost the field. Thus are my eyes still Captive to one sight: Thus all my thoughts are slaves to one thought still: Thus Reason to his servants yeelds his right; Thus is my power transformed to your will. What marvaile then I take a womans hew, Since what I see, thinke, know is all but you? [Come shepheards weedes, become your masters minde] [Musidorus.] Come shepheards weedes, become your masters minde: Yeld outward shew, what inward chance he tryes: Nor be abasht, since such a guest you finde, Whose strongest hope in your weake comfort lyes. Come shepheards weedes, attend my woefull cryes: Disuse your selves from sweete Menalcas voice: For other be those tunes which sorrow tyes, From those cleere notes which freely may rejoyce. Then power out plaint, and in one word say this: Helples his plaint, who spoyles himselfe of blisse. [Now thanked be the great God Pan] Now thanked be the great God Pan, which thus preserves my loved life: Thanked be I that keepe a man, who ended hath this fearefull strife: For if my man must praises have, what then must I that keepe the knave? For as the Moone the eies doth please, with gentle beames not hurting sight: Yet hath sir Sunne the greatest praise, because from him doth come her light: So if my man must praises have, what then must I that keepe the knave? The first Eclogues. [We love, and have our loves rewarded.] [The Shepheards.] We love, and have our loves rewarded. We love, and are no whit regarded. We finde most sweete affections snare, That sweete, but sower despairefull care. Who can despaire, whom hope doth beare? And who can hope, that feeles despaire? As without breath, no pipe doth move, No musike kindly without love. [Come Dorus, come, let songs thy sorowes signifie] Lalus and Dorus. Lalus. Come Dorus, come, let songs thy sorowes signifie: And if for want of use thy minde ashamed is, That verie shame with Loves high title dignifie. No stile is held for base, where Love well named is: Ech eare suckes up the words, a true love scattereth, And plaine speach oft, then quaint phrase, better framed is. Dorus. Nightingales seldome sing, the Pie still chattereth: The wood cries most, before it throughly kindled be, Deadly wounds inward bleed, ech sleight sore mattereth. Hardly they heard, which by good hunters singled be. Shallow brookes murmure most, deep silent slide away; Nor true love loves those loves with others mingled be. Lalus. If thou wilt not be seene, thy face goe hide away, Be none of us, or els maintaine our fashion: Who frownes at others feastes, dooth better bide away. But if thou hast a Love, in that Loves passion, I challenge thee by shew of her perfection, Which of us two deserveth most compassion. Dorus. Thy challenge great, but greater my protection: Sing then, and see (for now thou hast inflamed me) Thy health too meane a match for my infection. No, though the heav'ns for high attempts have blamed me, Yet high is my attempt, O Muse historifie Her praise, whose praise to learne your skill hath framed me. Lalus. Muse hold your peace: but thou, my God Pan, glorifie My Kalas giftes: who with all good gifts filled is. Thy pipe, Ã´ Pan, shall helpe, though I sing sorilie. A heape of sweetes she is, where nothing spilled is; Who though she be no Bee, yet full of honie is: A Lillie field, with plowe of Rose which tilled is. Milde as a Lambe, more daintie then a Conie is; Her eyes my eyesight is, her conversation More gladde to me, then to a miser monie is. What coye account she makes of estimation? How nice to touch, how all her speeches peized be? A Nimph thus turnde, but mended in translation. Dorus. Such Kala is: but ah, my fancies raysed be In one, whose name to name were high presumption, Since vertues all, to make her title, pleased be. O happie Gods, which by inward assumption Enjoy her soule, in bodies faire possession, And keep it joynde, fearing your seates consumption. How oft with raine of teares skies make confession, Their dwellers rapt with sight of her perfection From heav'nly throne to her heav'n use digression? Of best things then what world can yeeld confection To liken her? Decke yours with your comparison: She is her selfe, of best things the collection. Lalus. How oft my dolefull Sire cried to me, tarrie sonne When first he spied my love? how oft he said to me, Thou art no souldier fitte for Cupids garrison? My sonne, keepe this, that my long toyle hath laide to me: Love well thine owne: me thinkes, woolles whitenes passeth all: I never found long love such wealth hath paide to me. This winde he spent: but when my Kala glasseth all My sight in her faire limmes, I then assure my selfe, Not rotten sheepe, but high crownes she surpasseth all. Can I be poore, that her golde haire procure my selfe? Want I white wooll, whose eyes her white skinne garnished? Till I get her, shall I to keepe enure my selfe? Dorus How oft, when reason saw, love of her harnised With armour of my hart, he cried, O vanitie, To set a pearle in steele so meanely varnished? Looke to thy selfe; reach not beyond humanitie: Her minde, beames, state farre from thy weake wings banished: And Love, which lover hurts is inhumanitie. Thus Reason said: but she came, Reason vanished; Her eyes so maistering me, that such objection Seemde but to spoyle the foode of thoughts long famished. Her peereles height my minde to high erection Drawes up; and if hope-fayling ende lives pleasure, Of fayrer death how can I make election? Lalus. Once my well-waiting eyes espied my treasure, With sleeves turnde up, loose haire, and brest enlarged, Her fathers corne (moving her faire limmes) measure. O cried I, of so meane worke be discharged: Measure my case, how by thy beauties filling With seede of woes my hart brimme-full is charged. Thy father bids thee save, and chides for spilling. Save then my soule, spill not my thoughts well heaped, No lovely praise was ever got by killing. These bolde words she did heare, this fruite I reaped, That she, whose looke alone might make me blessed, Did smile on me, and then away she leaped. Dorus. Once, Ã´ sweete once, I saw with dread oppressed Her whom I dread; so that with prostrate lying Her length the earth in Loves chiefe clothing dressed. I saw that riches fall, and fell a crying; Let not dead earth enjoy so deare a cover, But deck therewith my soule for your sake dying. Lay all your feare upon your fearefull lover: Shine eyes on me, that both our lives be guarded; So I your sight, you shall your selves recover. I cried, and was with open rayes rewarded: But straight they fledde, summond by cruell honor, Honor, the cause, desart is not regarded. Lalus. This mayde, thus made for joyes, Ã´ Pan bemone her, That without love she spends her yeares of love: So faire a fielde would well become an owner. And if enchantment can a harde hart move, Teach me what circle may acquaint her sprite, Affections charmes in my behalfe to prove. The circle is my (round about her) sight: The power I will invoke dwelles in her eyes: My charme should be, she haunt me day and night. Dorus. Farre other care, Ã´ Muse, my sorrow tries, Bent to such one, in whom, my selfe must say, Nothing can mend that point that in her lies. What circle then in so rare force beares swaye? Whose sprite all sprites can spoile, raise, damne, or save: No charme holdes her, but well possesse she may; Possesse she doth, and makes my soule her slave: My eyes the bandes, my thoughts the fatall knot. No thralles like them that inward bondage have. Lalus. Kala at length conclude my lingring lotte: Disdaine me not, although I be not faire. Who is an heire of many hundred sheep Doth beauties keep, which never Sunne can burne, Nor stormes doo turne: fairenes serves oft to wealth. Yet all my health I place in your good-will. Which if you will (Ã´ doo) bestow on me, Such as you see, such still you shall me finde. Constant and kind: my sheep your foode shall breed, Their wooll your weede, I will you Musique yeeld In flowrie fielde; and as the day begins With twenty ginnes we will the small birds take, And pastimes make, as Nature things hath made. But when in shade we meet of mirtle bowes, Then Love allowes, our pleasures to enrich, The thought of which doth passe all worldly pelfe. Dorus. Lady your selfe, whom nether name I dare, And titles are but spots to such a worthe, Heare plaints come forth from dungeon of my minde. The noblest kinde rejects not others woes. I have no shewes of wealth: my wealth is you, My beauties hewe your beames, my health your deeds; My minde for weeds your vertues liverie weares. My foode is teares; my tunes waymenting yeeld: Despaire my fielde; the flowers spirits warrs: My day newe cares; my ginnes my daily sight, In which do light small birds of thoughts orethrowne: My pastimes none: time passeth on my fall: Nature made all, but me of dolours made: I finde no shade, but where my Sunne doth burne: No place to turne; without, within it fryes: Nor helpe by life or death who living dyes. Lalus. But if my Kala this my suite denies, Which so much reason beares, Let crowes picke out mine eyes, which saw too much: If still her minde be such, My earthy moulde will melte in watrie teares. Dorus. My earthy moulde doth melte in watrie teares, And they againe resolve To aire of sighes, sighes to the hartes fire turne, Which doth to ashes burne: So doth my life within it selfe dissolve, Lalus. So doth my life within it selfe dissolve, That I am like a flower New plucked from the place where it did breed, Life showing, dead indeed: Such force hath Love above poore Natures power. Dorus. Such force hath Love above poore Natures power, That I growe like a shade, Which being nought seems somewhat to the eyen, While that one body shine. Oh he is mard that is for others made. Lalus. Oh he is mard that is for others made. Which thought doth marre my piping declaration, Thinking how it hath mard my shepheards trade. Now my hoarse voice doth faile this occupation, And others long to tell their loves condition: Of singing take to thee the reputation. Dorus. Of singing take to thee the reputation New friend of mine; I yeeld to thy habilitie: My soule doth seeke another estimation. But ah my Muse I would thou hadst agilitie, To worke my Goddesse so by thy invention, On me to cast those eyes, where shine nobilitie. Seen, and unknowne; heard, but without attention. [As I my little flocke on Ister banke] [A yong Shepheard.] As I my little flocke on Ister banke (A little flocke; but well my pipe they couthe) Did piping leade, the Sunne already sanke Beyond our worlde, and ere I got my boothe Each thing with mantle black the night doth scothe; Saving the glowe worme, which would curteous be Of that small light oft watching shepheards see. The welkin had full niggardly enclosed In cofer of dimme clowdes his silver groates, Icleped starres; each thing to rest disposed: The caves were full, the mountaines voide of goates: The birds eyes closde closed their chirping notes. As for the Nightingale woodmusiques King, It August was, he daynde not then to sing. Amid my sheepe, though I sawe nought to feare Yet (for I nothing sawe) I feared sore; Then fonde I which thing is a charge to beare As for my sheepe I dradded mickle more Then ever for my selfe since I was bore: I sate me downe: for see to goe ne could, And sange unto my sheepe lest stray they should. The songe I sange old Lanquet had me taught, Lanquet, the shepheard best swift Ister knewe, For clerkly reed, and hating what is naught, For faithfull hart, cleane hands, and mouth as true: With his sweet skill my skillesse youth he drewe, To have a feeling tast of him that sitts Beyond the heaven, far more beyond your witts. He said, the Musique best thilke powers pleasd Was jumpe concorde betweene our wit and will: Where highest notes to godlines are raisd, And lowest sinke not downe to jote of ill: With old true tales he woont mine eares to fill, How sheepheards did of yore, how now they thrive, Spoiling their flock, or while twixt th? they strive. He liked me, but pitied lustfull youth: His good strong staffe my slippry yeares upbore: He still hop'd well, because he loved truth; Till forste to parte, with harte and eyes even sore, To worthy Coriden he gave me ore. But thus in okes true shade recounted he Which now in nights deepe shade sheep heard of me. Such maner time there was (what time I n'ot) When all this Earth, this damme or mould of ours Was onely won'd with such as beastes begot: Unknowne as then were they that builded towers: The cattell wild, or tame, in natures bowers Might freely rome, or rest, as seemed them: Man was not man their dwellings in to hem. The beastes had sure some beastly pollicie: For nothing can endure where order n'is. For once the Lion by the Lambe did lie; The fearefull Hinde the Leopard did kisse: Hurtles was Tygers pawe and Serpents hisse. This thinke I well, the beasts with courage clad Like Senators a harmeles empire had. At which whether the others did repine, (For envie harbreth most in feeblest hartes) Or that they all to chaunging did encline, (As even in beasts their d?mes leave chaunging parts) The multitude to Jove a suite empartes, With neighing, blaying, braying, and barking, Roring, and howling for to have a King. A King, in language theirs they said they would: (For then their language was a perfect speech) The birdes likewise with chirpes, and puing could Cackling, and chattring, that of Jove beseech. Onely the owle still warnde them not to seech So hastily that which they would repent: But sawe they would, and he to deserts went. Jove wisely said (for wisedome wisely sayes) O beasts, take heed what you of me desire. Rulers will thinke all things made them to please, And soone forget the swincke due to their hire. But since you will, part of my heav'nly fire I will you lende; the rest your selves must give, That it both seene and felte may with you live. Full glad they were and tooke the naked sprite, Which streight the Earth yclothed in his claye: The Lion, harte; the Ounce gave active might; The Horse, good shape; the Sparrow, lust to playe; Nightingale, voice, entising songes to saye. Elephant gave a perfect memorie: And Parot, ready tongue, that to applie. The Foxe gave crafte; the Dog gave flatterie; Asse, pacience; the Mole, a working thought; Eagle, high looke; Wolfe secrete crueltie: Monkie, sweet breath; the Cow, her faire eyes brought; The Ermion, whitest skinne, spotted with nought; The sheep, mild-seeming face; climing, the Beare; The Stagge did give the harme eschewing feare. The Hare, her sleights; the Cat, his melancholie; Ante, industrie; and Connie, skill to builde; Cranes, order; Storkes, to be appearing holie; CamÅleon, ease to chaunge; Ducke, ease to yelde; Crocodile, teares, which might be falsely spilde: Ape great thing gave, though he did mowing stand, The instrument of instruments, the hand. Ech other beast likewise his present brings: And (but they drad their Prince they ought should want) They all consented were to give him wings: And aye more awe towards him for to plant, To their owne worke this priviledge they graunt, That from thenceforth to all eternitie, No beast should freely speake, but onely he. Thus Man was made; thus Man their Lord became: Who at the first, wanting, or hiding pride, He did to beastes best use his cunning frame; With water drinke, herbes meate, and naked hide, And fellow-like let his dominion slide; Not in his sayings saying I, but we: As if he meant his lordship common be. But when his seate so rooted he had found, That they now skilld not, how from him to wend; Then gan in guiltlesse earth full many a wound, Iron to seeke, which gainst it selfe should bend, To teare the bowels, that good corne should send. But yet the common Damme none did bemone; Because (though hurt) they never heard her grone. Then gan the factions in the beastes to breed; Where helping weaker sort, the nobler beastes, (As Tygers, leopards, beares, and Lions seed) Disdaind with this, in deserts sought their restes; Where famine ravine taught their hungrie chestes, That craftily he forst them to do ill, Which being done he afterwards would kill. For murthers done, which never erst was seene, By those great beastes, as for the weakers good, He chose themselves his guarders for to bene, Gainst those of might, of whom in feare they stood, As horse and dogge, not great, but gentle blood: Blith were the commons cattell of the fielde, Tho when they saw their foen of greatnes kilde. But they or spent, or made of slender might, Then quickly did the meaner cattell finde, The great beames gone, the house on shoulders light: For by and by the horse faire bitts did binde: The dogge was in a coller taught his kinde. As for the gentle birds like case might rewe When falcon they, and gossehauke saw in mewe. Worst fell to smallest birds, and meanest heard, Whom now his owne, full like his owne he used. Yet first but wooll, or fethers off he teard: And when they were well us'de to be abused, For hungrie teeth their flesh with teeth he brused: At length for glutton taste he did them kill: At last for sport their sillie lives did spill. But yet Ã´ man, rage not beyond thy neede: Deeme it no gloire to swell in tyrannie. Thou art of blood; joy not to see things bleede: Thou fearest death; thinke they are loth to die. A plaint of guiltlesse hurt doth pierce the skie. And you poore beastes, in patience bide your hell, Or know your strengths, and then you shall do well. Thus did I sing, and pipe eight sullen houres To sheepe, whom love, not knowledge, made to heare, Now fancies fits, now fortunes balefull stowers: But then I homewards call'd my lambkins deare: For to my dimmed eyes beganne t'appeare The night growne old, her blacke head waxen gray, Sure shepherds signe, that morne should soone fetch day. [In faith, good Histor, long is your delay] Geron. Histor. Geron. In faith, good Histor, long is your delay, From holy marriage sweete and surest meane: Our foolish lust in honest rules to stay. I pray thee doo to Lalus sample leane: Thou seest, how friske, and jolly now he is, That last day seem'd, he could not chew a beane. Beleeve me man, there is no greater blisse, Then is the quiet joy of loving wife; Which who so wants, halfe of himselfe doth misse. Friend without change, playfellow without strife, Foode without fulnes, counsaile without pride, Is this sweet doubling of our single life. Histor. No doubt to whom so good chance did betide, As for to finde a pasture strawed with golde, He were a foole, if there he did not bide. Who would not have a PhÅnix if he could? The humming Waspe, if it had not a stinge, Before all flies the Waspe accept I would. But this bad world, few golden fieldes doth bring, PhÅnix but one, of Crowes we millions have: The Waspe seemes gay, but is a combrous thing. If many Kalaes our Arcadia gave, Lalus example I would soone ensue, And thinke, I did my selfe from sorrow save. But of such wives we finde a slender crew; Shrewdnes so stirres, pride so puffes up the hart, They seldome ponder what to them is due. With meager lookes, as if they still did smart; Puiling, and whimpring, or else scolding flat, Make home more paine then following of the cart. Ether dull silence, or eternall chat; Still contrarie to what her husband sayes; If he do praise the dog, she likes the cat. Austere she is, when he would honest playes; And gamesome then, when he thinkes on his sheepe; She bids him goe, and yet from jorney stayes. She warre doth ever with his kinsfolke keepe, And makes them fremb'd, who frinds by nature are, Envying shallow toyes with malice deepe. And if forsooth there come some new found ware, The little coine his sweating browes have got, Must goe for that, if for her lowres he care: Or els; Nay faith, mine is the lucklest lot, That ever fell to honest woman yet: No wife but I hath such a man, God wot. Such is their speech, who be of sober wit; But who doo let their tongues shew well their rage, Lord, what bywords they speake, what spite they spit? The house is made a very lothsome cage, Wherein the birde doth never sing but cry; With such a will as nothing can asswage. Dearely the servants doo their wages buy, Revil'd for ech small fault, sometimes for none: They better live that in a gaile doo lie. Let other fowler spots away be blowne; For I seeke not their shame, but still me thinkes, A better life it is to lye alone. Geron. Who for ech fickle feare from vertue shrinkes, Shall in his life embrace no worthy thing: No mortall man the cuppe of suretie drinkes. The heav'ns doo not good haps in handfuls bring, But let us pike our good from out much bad: That still our little world may know his king. But certainly so long we may be glad, While that we doo what nature doth require, And for th'event we never ought be sad. Man oft is plag'de with aire, is burnt with fire, In water dround, in earth his buriall is; And shall we not therefore their use desire? Nature above all things requireth this, That we our kind doo labour to maintaine; Which drawne-out line doth hold all humane blisse. Thy father justly may of thee complaine, If thou doo not repay his deeds for thee, In granting unto him a grandsires gaine. Thy common-wealth may rightly grieved be, Which must by this immortall be preserved, If thus thou murther thy posteritie. His very being he hath not deserved, Who for a selfe-conceipt will that forbeare, Whereby that being aye must be conserved. And God forbid, women such cattell were, As you paint them: but well in you I finde, No man doth speake aright, who speakes in feare. Who onely sees the ill is worse then blind. These fiftie winters maried have I beene; And yet finde no such faults in womankind. I have a wife worthie to be a Queene, So well she can command, and yet obay; In ruling of a house so well shee's seene. And yet in all this time, betwixt us tway, We beare our double yoke with such consent, That never past foule word, I dare well say. But these be your love-toyes, which still are spent In lawlesse games, and love not as you should, But with much studie learne late to repent. How well last day before our Prince you could Blinde Cupids workes with wonder testifie? Yet now the roote of him abase you would. Goe to, goe to, and Cupid now applie To that where thou thy Cupid maist avowe, And thou shalt finde, in women vertues lie. Sweete supple mindes which soone to wisdome bowe Where they by wisdomes rule directed are, And are not forst fonde thraldome to allow. As we to get are fram'd, so they to spare: We made for paine, our paines they made to cherish: We care abroad, and they of home have care. O Histor, seeke within thy selfe to flourish: Thy house by thee must live, or els be gone: And then who shall the name of Histor nourish? Riches of children passe a Princes throne; Which touch the fathers hart with secret joy, When without shame he saith, these be mine owne. Marrie therefore; for marriage will destroy Those passions which to youthfull head doo clime Mothers and Nurses of all vaine annoy. [You Gote-heard Gods, that love the grassie mountaines] Strephon. Klaius. Strephon. You Gote-heard Gods, that love the grassie mountaines, You Nimphes that haunt the springs in pleasant vallies, You Satyrs joyde with free and quiet forrests, Vouchsafe your silent eares to playning musique, Which to my woes gives still an early morning: And drawes the dolor on till wery evening. Klaius. O Mercurie, foregoer to the evening, O heavenlie huntresse of the savage mountaines, O lovelie starre, entitled of the morning, While that my voice doth fill these wofull vallies, Vouchsafe your silent eares to plaining musique, Which oft hath Echo tir'd in secrete forrests. Strephon. I that was once free-burges of the forrests, Where shade from Sunne, and sports I sought at evening, I that was once esteem'd for pleasant musique, Am banisht now among the monstrous mountaines Of huge despaire, and foule afflictions vallies, Am growne a shrich-owle to my selfe each morning. Klaius. I that was once delighted every morning, Hunting the wilde inhabiters of forrests, I that was once the musique of these vallies, So darkened am, that all my day is evening, Hart-broken so, that molehilles seeme high mountaines, And fill the vales with cries in steed of musique. Strephon Long since alas, my deadly Swannish musique Hath made it selfe a crier of the morning, And hath with wailing str?gth clim'd highest mountaines: Long since my thoughts more desert be then forrests: Long since I see my joyes come to their evening, And state throwen downe to over-troden vallies. Klaius. Long since the happie dwellers of these vallies, Have praide me leave my strange exclaiming musique, Which troubles their dayes worke, and joyes of evening: Long since I hate the night, more hate the morning: Long since my thoughts chase me like beasts in forrests, And make me wish my selfe layd under mountaines. Strephon. Me seemes I see the high and stately mountaines, Transforme themselves to lowe dejected vallies: Me seemes I heare in these ill-changed forrests, The Nightingales doo learne of Owles their musique: Me seemes I feele the comfort of the morning Turnde to the mortall serene of an evening. Klaius. Me seemes I see a filthie clowdie evening, As soon as Sunne begins to clime the mountaines: Me seemes I feele a noysome sent, the morning When I doo smell the flowers of these vallies: Me seemes I heare, when I doo heare sweete musique, The dreadfull cries of murdred men in forrests. Strephon. I wish to fire the trees of all these forrests; I give the Sunne a last farewell each evening; I curse the fidling finders out of Musicke: With envie I doo hate the loftie mountaines; And with despite despise the humble vallies: I doo detest night, evening, day, and morning. Klaius. Curse to my selfe my prayer is, the morning: My fire is more, then can be made with forrests; My state more base, then are the basest vallies: I wish no evenings more to see, each evening; Shamed I have my selfe in sight of mountaines, And stoppe mine eares, lest I growe mad with Musicke. Strephon. For she, whose parts maintainde a perfect musique, Whose beautie shin'de more then the blushing morning, Who much did passe in state the stately mountaines, In straightnes past the Cedars of the forrests, Hath cast me wretch into eternall evening, By taking her two Sunnes from these darke vallies. Klaius. For she, to whom compar'd, the Alpes are vallies, She, whose lest word brings from the spheares their musique, At whose approach the Sunne rose in the evening, Who, where she went, bare in her forhead morning, Is gone, is gone from these our spoyled forrests, Turning to desarts our best pastur'de mountaines. Strephon. Klaius. These mountaines witnesse shall, so shall these vallies, These forrests eke, made wretched by our musique, Our morning hymne is this, and song at evening. [If mine eyes can speake to doo harty errande] [Zelmane.] If mine eyes can speake to doo harty errande, Or mine eyes language she doo hap to judge of, So that eyes message be of her receaved, Hope we do live yet. But if eyes faile then, when I most doo need them, Or if eyes language be not unto her knowne, So that eyes message doo returne rejected, Hope we doo both dye. Yet dying, and dead, doo we sing her honour; So become our tombes monuments of her praise; So becomes our losse the triumph of her gayne; Hers be the glory. If the spheares senselesse doo yet hold a musique, If the Swannes sweet voice be not heard, but at death, If the mute timber when it hath the life lost, Yeldeth a lutes tune. Are then humane mindes priviledg'd so meanly, As that hatefull death can abridge them of powre, With the vowe of truth to recorde to all worldes, That we be her spoiles? Thus not ending, endes the due praise of her praise; Fleshly vaile consumes; but a soule hath his life, Which is helde in love, love it is, that hath joynde Life to this our soule. But if eyes can speake to doo harty errande, Or mine eyes language she doo hap to judge of, So that eyes message be of her receaved, Hope we doo live yet. The end of the first Booke. THE SECOND BOOKE OF THE COUNTESSE OF PEMBROKES ARCADIA. [In vaine, mine Eyes, you labour to amende] [Zelmane.] In vaine, mine Eyes, you labour to amende With flowing teares your fault of hasty sight: Since to my hart her shape you so did sende; That her I see, though you did lose your light. In vaine, my Hart, now you with sight are burnd, With sighes you seeke to coole your hotte desire: Since sighes (into mine inward fornace turnd) For bellowes serve to kindle more the fire. Reason, in vaine (now you have lost my hart) My head you seeke, as to your strongest forte: Since there mine eyes have played so false a parte, That to your strength your foes have sure resorte. Then since in vaine I find were all my strife, To this strange death I vainely yeeld my life. [Let not old age disgrace my high desire] [Zelmane.] Let not old age disgrace my high desire, O heavenly soule, in humaine shape conteind: Old wood inflam'de, doth yeeld the bravest fire, When yonger dooth in smoke his vertue spend. Ne let white haires, which on my face doo grow, Seeme to your eyes of a disgracefull hewe: Since whitenesse doth present the sweetest show, Which makes all eyes doo honour unto you. Old age is wise and full of constant truth; Old age well stayed from raunging humor lives: Old age hath knowne what ever was in youth: Old age orecome, the greater honour gives. And to old age since you your selfe aspire, Let not old age disgrace my high desire. [Since so mine eyes are subject to your sight] [Dorus.] Since so mine eyes are subject to your sight, That in your sight they fixed have my braine; Since so my harte is filled with that light, That onely light doth all my life maintaine; Since in sweete you all goods so richly raigne, That where you are no wished good can want; Since so your living image lives in me, That in my selfe your selfe true love doth plant; How can you him unworthy then decree, In whose chiefe parte your worthes implanted be? [My sheepe are thoughts, which I both guide and serve] [Dorus.] My sheepe are thoughts, which I both guide and serve: Their pasture is faire hilles of fruitlesse Love: On barren sweetes they feede, and feeding sterve: I waile their lotte, but will not other prove. My sheepehooke is wanne hope, which all upholdes: My weedes, Desire, cut out in endlesse foldes. What wooll my sheepe shall beare, whiles thus they live, In you it is, you must the judgement give. [You living powres enclosed in stately shrine] You living powres enclosed in stately shrine Of growing trees; you rurall Gods that wield Your scepters here, if to your eares divine A voice may come, which troubled soule doth yeld: This vowe receave, this vowe Ã´ Gods maintaine; My virgin life no spotted thought shall staine. Thou purest stone, whose purenesse doth present My purest minde; whose temper hard doth showe My tempred hart; by thee my promise sent Unto my selfe let after-livers know. No fancy mine, nor others wronge suspect Make me, Ã´ vertuous Shame, thy lawes neglect. O Chastitie, the chiefe of heavenly lightes, Which makst us most immortall shape to weare, Holde thou my hart, establish thou my sprights: To onely thee my constant course I beare. Till spotlesse soule unto thy bosome flye, Such life to leade, such death I vow to dye. [My words, in hope to blaze my stedfast minde] My words, in hope to blaze my stedfast minde, This marble chose, as of like temper knowne: But loe, my words defaste, my fancies blinde, Blots to the stone, shame to my selfe I finde: And witnesse am, how ill agree in one, A womans hand with constant marble stone. My words full weake, the marble full of might; My words in store, the marble all alone; My words blacke inke, the marble kindly white; My words unseene, the marble still in sight, May witnesse beare, how ill agree in one, A womans hand, with constant marble stone. [What toong can her perfections tell] [Zelmane.] What toong can her perfections tell In whose each part all pens may dwell? Her haire fine threeds of finest gould In curled knots mans thought to hold: But that her fore-head sayes in me A whiter beautie you may see. Whiter indeed; more white then snow, Which on cold winters face doth grow. That doth present those even browes, Whose equall line their angles bowes, Like to the Moone when after chaunge Her horned head abroad doth raunge: And arches be to heavenly lids, Whose winke ech bold attempt forbids. For the blacke starres those Spheares containe, The matchlesse paire, even praise doth staine. No lampe, whose light by Art is got, No Sunne, which shines, and seeth not, Can liken them without all peere, Save one as much as other cleere: Which onely thus unhappie be, Because themselves they cannot see. Her cheekes with kindly claret spred. Aurora like new out of bed, Or like the fresh Queene-apples side, Blushing at sight of PhÅbus pride. Her nose, her chinne pure ivorie weares: No purer then the pretie eares. So that therein appeares some blood, Like wine and milke that mingled stood In whose Incirclets if ye gaze, Your eyes may tread a Lovers maze. But with such turnes the voice to stray, No talke untaught can finde the way. The tippe no jewell needes to weare: The tippe is jewell of the eare. But who those ruddie lippes can misse? Which blessed still themselves doo kisse. Rubies, Cherries, and Roses new, In worth, in taste, in perfitte hewe: Which never part but that they showe Of pretious pearle the double rowe, The second sweetly-fenced warde, Her heav'nly-dewed tongue to garde. Whence never word in vaine did flowe. Faire under these doth stately growe, The handle of this pretious worke, The neck, in which strange graces lurke. Such be I thinke the sumptuous towers Which skill dooth make in Princes bowers. So good a say invites the eye, A little downward to espie, The livelie clusters of her brests, Of Venus babe the wanton nests: Like pomels round of Marble cleere: Where azurde veines well mixt appeere. With dearest tops of porphyrie. Betwixt these two a way doth lie, A way more worthie beauties fame, Then that which beares the Milkie name. This leades into the joyous field, Which onely still doth Lillies yeeld: But Lillies such whose native smell The Indian odours doth excell. Waste it is calde, for it doth waste Mens lives, untill it be imbraste. There may one see, and yet not see Her ribbes in white all armed be. More white then Neptunes fomie face, When strugling rocks he would imbrace. In those delights the wandring thought Might of each side astray be brought, But that her navel doth unite, In curious circle, busie sight: A daintie seale of virgin-waxe, Where nothing but impression lackes. Her bellie then gladde sight doth fill, Justly entitled Cupids hill. A hill most fitte for such a master, A spotlesse mine of Alablaster. Like Alablaster faire and sleeke, But soft and supple satten like. In that sweete seate the Boy doth sport: Loath, I must leave his chiefe resort. âFor such a use the world hath gotten, âThe best things still must be forgotten. Yet never shall my song omitte Thighes, for Ovids song more fitte; Which flanked with two sugred flankes, Lift up their stately swelling bankes; That Albion clives in whitenes passe: With hanches smooth as looking glasse. But bow all knees, now of her knees My tongue doth tell what fancie sees. The knottes of joy, the gemmes of love, Whose motion makes all graces move. Whose bought incav'd doth yeeld such sight, Like cunning Painter shadowing white. The gartring place with child-like signe, Shewes easie print in mettall fine. But then againe the flesh doth rise In her brave calves, like christall skies. Whose Atlas is a smallest small, More white then whitest bone of all. Thereout steales out that round cleane foote This noble Cedars pretious roote: In shewe and sent pale violets, Whose steppe on earth all beautie sets. But back unto her back, my Muse, Where Ledas swanne his feathers mewes, Along whose ridge such bones are met, Like comfits round in marchpane set. Her shoulders be like two white Doves, Pearching within square royall rooves, Which leaded are with silver skinne, Passing the hate-sport Ermelin. And thence those armes derived are; The PhÅnix wings are not so rare For faultlesse length, and stainelesse hewe, Ah woe is me, my woes renewe; Now course doth leade me to her hand, Of my first love the fatall band. Where whitenes dooth for ever sitte: Nature her selfe enameld it. For there with strange compact dooth lie Warme snow, moyst pearle, softe ivorie. There fall those Saphir-coloured brookes, Which conduit-like with curious crookes, Sweete Ilands make in that sweete land. As for the fingers of the hand, The bloudy shaftes of Cupids warre, With amatists they headed are. Thus hath each part his beauties part, But how the Graces doo impart To all her limmes a spetiall grace, Becomming every time and place. Which doth even beautie beautifie, And most bewitch the wretched eye. How all this is but a faire Inne Of fairer guestes, which dwell within. Of whose high praise, and praisefull blisse, Goodnes the penne, heaven paper is. The inke immortall fame dooth lende: As I began, so must I ende. No tongue can her perfections tell, In whose each part all tongues may dwell. [Alas how long this pilgrimage doth last?] Plangus. Basilius. Plangus. Alas how long this pilgrimage doth last? What greater ills have now the heavens in store, To couple comming harmes with sorrowes past? Long since my voice is hoarce, and throte is sore, With cries to skies, and curses to the ground, But more I plaine, I feele my woes the more. Ah where was first that cruell cunning found, To frame of Earth a vessell of the minde, Where it should be to selfe-destruction bound? What needed so high sprites such mansions blind? Or wrapt in flesh what do they here obtaine, But glorious name of wretched humaine-kind? Balles to the starres, and thralles to Fortunes raigne; Turnd from themselves, infected with their cage, Where death is feard, and life is held with paine. Like players pla'st to fill a filthy stage, Where chaunge of thoughts one foole to other shewes, And all but jests, save onely sorrowes rage. The child feeles that; the man that feeling knowes, With cries first borne, the presage of his life, Where wit but serves, to have true tast of woes. A Shop of shame, a Booke where blots be rife This bodie is: this bodie so composed, As in it selfe to nourish mortall strife. So divers be the Elements disposed In this weake worke, that it can never be Made uniforme to any state reposed. Griefe onely makes his wretched state to see (Even like a toppe which nought but whipping moves) This man, this talking beast, this walking tree. Griefe is the stone which finest judgement proves: For who grieves not hath but a blockish braine, Since cause of griefe no cause from life removes. Basilius. How long wilt thou with monefull musicke staine The cheerefull notes these pleasant places yeeld, Where all good haps a perfect state maintaine? Plangus. Curst be good haps, and curst be they that build Their hopes on haps, and do not make despaire For all these certaine blowes the surest shield. Shall I that saw Eronaes shining haire Torne with her hands, and those same hands of snow With losse of purest blood themselves to teare? Shall I that saw those brests, where beauties flow, Swelling with sighes, made pale with mindes disease, And saw those eyes (those Sonnes) such shoures to shew, Shall I, whose eares her mournefull words did seaze, Her words in syrup laid of sweetest breath, Relent those thoughts, which then did so displease? No, no: Despaire my dayly lesson saith, And saith, although I seeke my life to flie, Plangus must live to see Eronaes death. Plangus must live some helpe for her to trie Though in despaire, so Love enforceth me; Plangus doth live, and must Erona dye? Erona dye? O heaven (if heaven there be) Hath all thy whirling course so small effect? Serve all thy starrie eyes this shame to see? Let doltes in haste some altars faire erect To those high powers, which idly sit above, And vertue do in greatest need neglect. Basilius. O man, take heed, how thou the Gods do move To irefull wrath, which thou canst not resist. Blasphemous words the speaker vaine do prove. Alas while we are wrapt in foggie mist Of our selfe-love (so passions do deceave) We thinke they hurt, when most they do assist. To harme us wormes should that high Justice leave His nature? nay, himselfe? for so it is. What glorie from our losse can he receave? But still our dazeled eyes their way do misse, While that we do at his sweete scourge repine, The kindly way to beate us to our blisse. If she must dye, then hath she past the line Of lothsome dayes, whose losse how canst thou mone, That doost so well their miseries define? But such we are with inward tempest blowne Of mindes quite contrarie in waves of will: We mone that lost, which had we did bemone. Plangus. And shall shee dye? shall cruell fier spill Those beames that set so many harts on fire? Hath she not force even death with love to kill? Nay even cold Death enflamde with hot desire Her to enjoy, where joy it selfe is thrall, Will spoile the earth of his most rich attire. Thus Death becomes a rivall to us all, And hopes with foule embracements her to get, In whose decay Vertues faire shrine must fall. O Vertue weake, shall death his triumph set Upon thy spoiles, which never should lye waste? Let Death first dye; be thou his worthy let. By what eclipse shall that Sonne be defaste? What myne hath erst throwne downe so faire a tower? What sacriledge hath such a saint disgra'st? The world the garden is, she is the flower That sweetens all the place; she is the guest Of rarest price, both heav'n and earth her bower. And shall (Ã´ me) all this in ashes rest? Alas, if you a PhÅnix new will have Burnt by the Sunne, she first must build her nest. But well you know, the gentle Sunne would save Such beames so like his owne, which might have might In him, the thoughts of PhaÃ«tons damme to grave. Therefore, alas, you use vile Vulcans spight, Which nothing spares, to melt that Virgin-waxe Which while it is, it is all Asias light. O Mars, for what doth serve thy armed axe? To let that wit-old beast consume in flame Thy Venus child, whose beautie Venus lackes? O Venus (if her praise no envy frames, In thy high minde) get her thy husbands grace. Sweete speaking oft a currish hart reclaimes. O eyes of mine, where once she saw her face, Her face which was more lively in my hart; O braine, where thought of her hath onely place; O hand, which toucht her hand when she did part; O lippes, that kist her hand with my teares sprent; O toonge, then dumbe, not daring tell my smart; O soule, whose love in her is onely spent, What ere you see, thinke, touch, kisse, speake, or love, Let all for her, and unto her be bent. Basilius. Thy wailing words do much my spirits move, They uttred are in such a feeling fashion, That sorrowes worke against my will I prove. Me-thinkes I am partaker of thy passion, And in thy case do glasse mine owne debilitie: Selfe-guiltie folke most prone to feele compassion. Yet Reason saith, Reason should have abilitie, To hold these worldly things in such proportion, As let them come or go with even facilitie. But our Desires tyrannicall extortion Doth force us there to set our chiefe delightfulnes, Where but a baiting place is all our portion. But still, although we faile of perfect rightfulnes, Seeke we to tame the childish superfluities: Let us not winke though void of purest sightfulnes. For what can breed more peevish incongruities, Then man to yeeld to female lamentations? Let us some grammar learne of more congruities. Plangus. If through mine eares pearce any consolation By wise discourse, sweete tunes, or Poets fiction; If ought I cease these hideous exclamations, While that my soule, she, she lives in affliction; Then let my life long time on earth maintained be, To wretched me, the last worst malediction. Can I, that know her sacred parts restrained be, For any joy, know fortunes vile displacing her, In morall rules let raging woes contained be? Can I forget, when they in prison placing her, With swelling hart in spite and due disdainfulnes She lay for dead, till I helpt with unlasing her? Can I forget, from how much mourning plainfulnes With Diamond in window-glasse she graved, Erona dye, and end thy ougly painefulnes? Can I forget in how straunge phrase she craved That quickly they would her burne, drowne, or smother, As if by death she onely might be saved? Then let me eke forget one hand from other: Let me forget that Plangus I am called: Let me forget I am sonne to my mother, But if my memory must thus be thralled To that strange stroke which conquer'd all my senses, Can thoughts still thinking so rest unappalled? Basilius. Who still doth seeke against himselfe offences, What pardon can availe? or who employes him To hurt himselfe, what shields can be defenses? Woe to poore man: ech outward thing annoyes him In divers kinds; yet as he were not filled, He heapes in inward griefe, which most destroyes him. Thus is our thought with paine for thistles tilled: Thus be our noblest parts dryed up with sorrow: Thus is our mind with too much minding spilled. One day layes up stuffe of griefe for the morrow: And whose good haps do leave him unprovided, Condoling cause of friendship he will borrow. Betwixt the good and shade of good divided, We pittie deeme that which but weakenes is: So are we from our high creation slided. But Plangus lest I may your sicknesse misse Or rubbing hurt the sore, I here doo end. The asse did hurt when he did thinke to kisse. [Poore Painters oft with silly Poets joyne] Poore Painters oft with silly Poets joyne, To fill the world with strange but vaine conceits: One brings the stuffe, the other stamps the coine, Which breeds nought else but gloses of deceits. Thus Painters Cupid paint, thus Poets do A naked god, young blind, with arrowes two. Is he a God, that ever flies the light? Or naked he, disguis'd in all untruth? If he be blind, how hitteth he so right? How is he young, that tam'de old PhÅbus youth? But arrowes two, and tipt with gold or leade: Some hurt accuse a third with horny head. No, nothing so; an old false knave he is By Argus got on Io, then a cow: What time for her Juno her Jove did misse, And charge of her to Argus did allow. Mercury kill'd his false sire for this act, His damme a beast was pardon'd beastly fact. With fathers death, and mothers guiltie shame, With Joves disdaine at such a rivals seed, The wretch compell'd a runnagate became, And learn'd what ill a miser state doth breed, To lye, faine, gloze, to steale, pry, and accuse, Naught in himselfe ech other to abuse. Yet beares he still his parents stately gifts, A horned head, cloven foote, and thousand eyes, Some gazing still, some winking wilye shiftes, With long large eares where never rumour dyes. His horned head doth seeme the heaven to spight: His cloven foote doth never treade aright. Thus halfe a man, with man he dayly haunts, Cloth'd in the shape which soonest may deceave: Thus halfe a beast, ech beastly vice he plants, In those weake harts that his advice receave. He proules ech place stil in new colours deckt, Sucking ones ill, another to infect. To narrow brests he comes all wrapt in gaine: To swelling harts he shines in honours fire: To open eyes all beauties he doth raine; Creeping to ech with flattering of desire. But for that Loves desire most rules the eyes, Therein his name, there his chiefe triumph lyes. Millions of yeares this old drivell Cupid lives; While still more wretch, more wicked he doth prove: Till now at length that Jove him office gives, (At Junos suite who much did Argus love) In this our world a hang-man for to be, Of all those fooles that will have all they see. [Loved I am, and yet complaine of Love] [Zelmane.] Loved I am, and yet complaine of Love: As loving not, accus'd, in Love I die. When pittie most I crave, I cruell prove: Still seeking Love, love found as much I flie. Burnt in my selfe, I muse at others fire: What I call wrong, I doo the same, and more: Bard of my will, I have beyond desire: I waile for want, and yet am chokte with store. This is thy worke, thou God for ever blinde: Though thousands old, a Boy entit'led still. Thus children doo the silly birds they finde, With stroking hurt, and too much cramming kill. Yet thus much Love, O Love, I crave of thee: Let me be lov'd, or els not loved be. [Over these brookes trusting to ease mine eyes] [Zelmane.] Over these brookes trusting to ease mine eyes, (Mine eyes even great in labour with their teares) I layde my face; my face wherein there lyes Clusters of clowdes, which no Sunne ever cleares. In watry glasse my watrie eyes I see: Sorrowes ill easde, where sorrowes painted be. My thoughts imprisonde in my secreat woes, With flamie breathes doo issue oft in sound: The sound to this strange aier no sooner goes, But that it dooth with Echoes force rebound. And make me heare the plaints I would refraine: Thus outward helps my inward griefes maintaine. Now in this sande I would discharge my minde, And cast from me part of my burdnous cares: But in the sand my tales foretolde I finde, And see therein how well the writer fares. Since streame, aier, sand, mine eyes and eares conspire: What hope to quench, where each thing blowes the fire? [Me thought some staves he mist: if so, not much amisse] [The Shepherds.] Me thought some staves he mist: if so, not much amisse: For where he most would hit, he ever yet did misse. One said he brake acrosse; full well it so might be: For never was there man more crossely crost then he. But most cryed, O well broke: O foole full gaily blest: Where failing is a shame, and breaking is his best. [Wyth two strange fires of equall heate possest] [Philoclea.] Wyth two strange fires of equall heate possest, The one of Love, the other Jealousie, Both still do worke, in neither finde I rest: For both, alas, their strengthes together tie: The one aloft doth holde, the other hie. Love wakes the jealous eye least thence it moves: The jealous eye, the more it lookes, it loves. These fires increase: in these I dayly burne: They feede on me, and with my wings do flie: My lovely joyes to dolefull ashes turne: Their flames mount up, my powers prostrate lie: They live in force, I quite consumed die. One wonder yet farre passeth my conceate: The fuell small: how be the fires so great? [A hatefull cure with hate to heale] A hatefull cure with hate to heale: A blooddy helpe with blood to save: A foolish thing with fooles to deale: Let him be bold that bobs will have. But who by meanes of wisdome hie Hath sav'd his charge? it is even I. Let other deck their pride with skarres, And of their wounds make brave lame showes: First let them die, then passe the starres, When rotten Fame will tell their blowes. But eye from blade, and eare from crie: Who hath sav'd all? it is even I. [Thy elder care shall from thy carefull face] [Basilius.] Thy elder care shall from thy carefull face By princely meane be stolne, and yet not lost. Thy yonger shall with Natures blisse embrace An uncouth love, which Nature hateth most. Both they themselves unto such two shall wed, Who at thy beer, as at a barre, shall plead; Why thee (a living man) they had made dead. In thy owne seate a forraine state shall sit. And ere that all these blowes thy head doo hit, Thou, with thy wife, adultry shall commit. [Apollo great, whose beames the greater world do light] [Basilius.] Apollo great, whose beames the greater world do light, And in our little world do cleare our inward sight, Which ever shine, though hid from earth by earthly shade, Whose lights do ever live, but in our darkenesse fade; Thou God, whose youth was deckt with spoiles of Pyth?s skin: â(So humble knowledge can throw downe the snakish kinne) Latonas sonne, whose birth in paine and travaile long Doth teach, to learne the good what travailes do belong: âIn travaile of our life (a short but tedious space) While brickle houreglas runnes, guide thou our panting pace: Give us foresightfull mindes: give us minds to obaye What foresight tels; our thoughts upon thy knowledge staye. Let so our fruites grow up, that nature be maintainde: But so our hartes keepe downe, with vice they be not stainde. Let this assured holde our judgements overtake, âThat nothing winnes the heaven, but what doth earth forsake. The second Eclogues. [Thou Rebell vile, come, to thy master yelde] R. Thou Rebell vile, come, to thy master yelde. P. No, Tyrant, no: mine, mine shall be the fielde. Reason. Can Reason then a Tyraunt counted be? Passion. If Reason will, that Passions be not free. R. But Reason will, that Reason governe most. P. And Passion will, that Passion rule the rost. R. Your will is will; but Reason reason is. P. Will hath his will, when Reasons will doth misse. R. Whom Passion leades unto his death is bent. P. And let him die, so that he die content. R. By nature you to Reason faith have sworne. P. Not so, but fellowlike together borne. R. Who Passion doth ensue, lives in annoy. P. Who Passion doth forsake, lives void of joy. R. Passion is blinde, and treades an unknowne trace. P. Reason hath eyes to see his owne ill case. R. Dare Passions then abide in Reasons light? P. And is not Reason dimde with Passions might? R. O foolish thing, which glory doth destroye. P. O glorious title of a foolish toye. R. Weakenes you are, dare you with our strength fight? P. Because our weaknes weakeneth all your might. R. O sacred Reason, helpe our vertuous toiles. P. O Passion, passe on feeble Reasons spoiles. R. We with ourselves abide a daily strife. P. We gladly use the sweetnes of our life. R. But yet our strife sure peace in end doth breede. P. We now have peace, your peace we doo not neede. R. We are too strong: but Reason seekes no blood. P. Who be too weake, do feigne they be too good. R. Though we cannot orecome, our cause is just. P. Let us orecome, and let us be unjust. R. Yet Passion, yeeld at length to Reasons stroke. P. What shall we winne by taking Reasons yoke? R. The joyes you have shall be made permanent. P. But so we shall with griefe learne to repent. R. Repent indeed, but that shall be your blisse. P. How know we that, since present joyes we misse? R. You know it not: of Reason therefore know it. P. No Reason yet had ever skill to show it. R. P. Then let us both to heavenly rules give place, Which Passions skill, and Reason do deface. [Dorus, tell me, where is thy wonted motion] Dicus. Dorus Dicus. Dorus, tell me, where is thy wonted motion To make these woods resounde thy lamentation? Thy sainte is dead, or dead is thy devotion. For who doth holde his love in estimation, To witnes, that he thinkes his thoughts delicious, Thinks to make ech thing badge of his sweet passion. Dorus. But what doth make thee Dicus so suspicious Of my due faith, which needs must be immutable? Who others vertue doubt, themselves are vicious. Not so; although my mettall were most mutable, Her beames have wrought therin most faire impression: To such a force some chaunge were nothing sutable. Dicus. The harte well set doth never shunne confession: If noble be thy bandes, make them notorious: Silence doth seeme the maske of base oppression. Who glories in his love, doth make Love glorious: But who doth feare, or bideth muet wilfully, Showes, guilty harte doth deeme his state opprobrious. Thou then, that framste both words &amp; voice most skilfully, Yeeld to our eares a sweet and sound relation, If Love tooke thee by force, or caught thee guilefully. Dorus. If Sunnie beames shame heav'nly habitation; If three-leav'd grasse seeme to the sheepe unsavorie, Then base and sower is Loves most high vocation. Or if sheepes cries can helpe the Sunnes owne braverie, Then may I hope, my pipe may have abilitie, To helpe her praise, who decks me in her slaverie. No, no: no wordes ennoble selfe-nobilitie. As for your doubts; her voice was it deceaved me, Her eye the force beyond all possibilitie. Dicus. Thy words well voic'd, well gra'ste had almost heaved me Quite from my selfe to love Loves contemplation; Till of these thoughts thy sodaine ende bereaved me. Goe on therefore, and tell us, by what fashion In thy owne proofe he gets so straunge possession, And how possest he strengthens his invasion? Dorus. Sight is his roote, in thought is his progression, His childhood woonder, prenticeship attention, His youth delight, his age the soules oppression: Doubte is his sleepe, he waketh in invention; Fancie his foode, his clothing is of carefulnes; Beautie his boote, his play lovers dissention: His eyes are curious search, but vailde with warefulnesse: His wings desire oft clipt with desperation: Largesse his hands could never skill of sparefulnesse. But how he doth by might, or by persuasion To conquere, and his conquest how to ratifie, Experience doubts, and schooles holde disputation. Dicus. But so thy sheepe may thy good wishes satisfie With large encrease, and wooll of fine perfection, So she thy love, her eyes thy eyes may gratifie, As thou wilt give our soules a deare refection, By telling how she was, how now she framed is To helpe, or hurt in thee her owne infection. Dorus. Blest be the name, wherewith my mistres named is: Whose wounds are salves, whose yokes please more then pleasure doth: Her staines are beames; vertue the fault she blamed is. The hart, eye, eare here onely find his treasure doth: All numbring artes her endlesse graces number not: Time, place, life, wit scarcely her rare gifts measure doth. Is she in rage? so is the Sunne in sommer hot, Yet harvest brings. Doth she alas absent herselfe? The Sunne is hid; his kindly shadows cumber not. But when to give some grace she doth content herselfe, O then it shines; then are the heav'ns distributed, And Venus seemes, to make up her, she spent herselfe. Thus then (I say) my mischiefes have contributed A greater good by her divine reflection; My harmes to me, my blisse to her attributed, Thus she is framde: her eyes are my direction; Her love my life; her anger my destruction. Lastly what so she is, that's my protection. Dicus. Thy safetie sure is wrapped in destruction: For that construction thine owne wordes do beare. A man to feare a womans moodie eye, Makes Reason lie a slave to servile Sense. A weake defence where weakenesse is thy force: So is remorse in follie dearely bought. Dorus. If I had thought to heare blasphemous wordes, My brest to swords, my soule to hell have solde I rather would, then thus mine eares defile With words so vile, which viler breath doth breed. O heards take heed; for I a woolfe have found; Who hunting round the strongest for to kill, His breast doth fill with earth of others joyes, And loden so puls downe, puld downe destroyes. O sheepheards boyes, eschue these tongues of venome, Which do envenome both the soule and senses. Our best defenses are to flie these adders. O tongues like ladders made to clime dishonour, Who judge that honour, which hath scope to slander. Dicus. Dorus you wander farre in great reproches; So love encroches on your charmed reason, But it is season for to end our singing. Such anger bringing: as for me, my fancie In sicke-mans frenzie rather takes compassion, Then rage for rage: rather my wish I send to thee, Thou soone may have some helpe, or change of passion. She oft her lookes, the starres her favour bend to thee: Fortune store, Nature health, Love grant perswasion. A quiet mind none but thy selfe can lend to thee, Thus I commend to thee all our former love, Dorus. Well do I prove, errour lies oft in zeale, Yet it is seale, though errour, of true hart. Nought could impart such heates to friendly mind. But for to find thy words did her disgrace, Whose onely face the little heaven is, Which who doth misse his eyes are but delusions, Barr'd from their chiefest object of delightfulnesse, Throwne on this earth the Chaos of confusions. As for thy wish to my enraged spitefulnesse, The lovely blowne with rare reward, my prayer is Thou mayest love her that I may see thy sightfulnesse. The quiet mind (whereof my selfe empairer is, As thou doest thinke) should most of all disquiet me Without her love, then any mind who fairer is. Her onely cure from surfet-woes can diet me: She holdes the ballance of my contentation: Her cleared eyes, nought els, in stormes can quiet me. Nay rather then my ease discontentation Should breed to her, let me for aye dejected be From any joy, which might her griefe occasion. With so sweete plagues my happie harmes infected be: Paine willes me die, yet will of death I mortifie: For though life irkes, in life my loves protected be. Thus for ech change my changelesse hart I fortifie. [And are you there old Pas? in troth I ever thought] Nico. Dorus. Nico. And are you there old Pas? in troth I ever thought, Among us all we should find out some thing of nought. Pas. And I am here the same, so mote I thrive and thee, Despairde in all this flocke to find a knave, but thee. Nico. Ah now I see, why thou art in thy selfe so blind: Thy gray-hood hides the thing, that thou despairst to find. Pas. My gray-hood is mine owne, all be it be but gray, Not like the scrippe thou stol'ste, while Dorcas sleeping lay. Nico. Mine was the scrippe: but thou, that seeming raid with love, Didst snatch from Cosmas hand her greeny wrought? glove. Pas. Ah foole; so Courtiers do. But who did lively skippe, When for a treene-dish stolne, thy father did thee whippe? Nico. In deed the witch thy dam her crouch from shoulder spred, For pilfring Lalus lambe, with crouch to blesse thy head. Pas. My voice the lambe did winne, Menalcas was our judge: Of singing match was made, whence he with shame did trudge. Nico. Couldst thou make Lalus flie? so nightingales avoide, When with the kawing crowes their musicke is annoide. Pas. Nay like to nightingales the other birds give eare: My pipe and song made him both pipe and song forsweare. Nico. I thinke it well: such voice would make one musicke hate: But if I had bene there, th'adst met another mate. Pas. Another sure as is a gander from a goose: But still when thou dost sing, me thinkes a colt is loose. Nico. Well aimed by my hat: for as thou sangst last day; The neighbours all did crie, alas what asse doth bray? Pas. But here is Dicus old; let him then speake the woord, To whether with best cause the Nymphes faire flowers affoord. Nico. Content: but I will lay a wager hereunto, That profit may ensue to him that best can do. I have (and long shall have) a white great nimble cat, A king upon a mouse, a strong foe to the rat, Fine eares, long taile he hath, with Lions curbed clawe, Which oft he lifteth up, and stayes his lifted pawe, Deepe musing to himselfe, which after-mewing showes, Till with lickt beard, his eye of fire espie his foes. If thou (alas poore if) do winne, then winne thou this, And if I better sing, let me thy Cosma kisse. Pas. Kisse her? now mayst thou kisse. I have a better match; A prettie curre it is; his name iwis is Catch, No eare nor taile he hath, least they should him disgrace, A ruddie haire his cote, with fine long spectled face: He never musing standes, but with himselfe will play Leaping at every flie, and angrie with a flea: He eft would kill a mouse, but he disdaines to fight, And makes our home good sport with dauncing bolt upright. This is my pawne; the price let Dicus judgement show: Such oddes I willing lay; for him and you I know. Dicus. Sing then my lads, but sing with better vaine then yet, Or else who singeth worst, my skill will hardly hit. Nico. Who doubts but Pas fine pipe againe will bring The auncient prayse to Arcad shepheards skill? Pan is not dead, since Pas beginnes to sing. Pas. Who evermore will love Apollos quill, Since Nico doth to sing so widely gape? Nico his place farre better furnish will. Nico. Was not this he, who did for Syrinx scape Raging in woes teach pastors first to plaine? Do you not heare his voice, and see his shape? Pas. This is not he that failed her to gaine, Which made a Bay, made Bay a holy tree: But this is one that doth his musicke staine. Nico. O Faunes, O Fairies all, and do you see, And suffer such a wrong? a wrong I trowe, That Nico must with Pas compared be? Pas. O Nymphes, I tell you newes, for Pas you knowe: While I was warbling out your woonted praise, Nico would needes with Pas his bagpipe blowe. Nico. If never I did faile your holy-dayes, With daunces, carols, or with barlybreake: Let Pas now know, how Nico makes the layes. Pas. If each day hath bene holy for your sake, Unto my pipe, O Nimphes, helpe now my pipe, For Pas well knowes what layes can Nico make. Nico. Alas how oft I looke on cherries ripe, Me thinkes I see the lippes my Leuca hath, And wanting her, my weeping eyes I wipe. Pas. Alas, when I in spring meete roses rathe, And thinke from Cosmas sweet red lips I live, I leave mine eyes unwipte my cheekes to bathe. Nico. As I of late, neer bushes usde my sive, I spied a thrush where she did make her nest, That will I take, and to my Leuca give. Pas. But long have I a sparrow gailie drest, As white as milke, and comming to the call, To put it with my hand in Cosmas brest. Nico. I oft doo sue, and Leuca saith, I shall, But when I did come neere with heate and hope, She ranne away, and threw at me a ball. Pas. Cosma once said, she left the wicket ope, For me to come, and so she did: I came, But in the place found nothing but a rope. Nico. When Leuca dooth appeare, the Sunne for shame Dooth hide himselfe: for to himselfe he sayes, If Leuca live, she darken will my fame. Pas. When Cosma doth come forth, the Sun displaies His utmost light: for well his witte doth know, Cosmas faire beames emblemish much his raies. Nico. Leuca to me did yester-morning showe In perfect light, which could not me deceave, Her naked legge, more white then whitest snowe. Pas. But yesternight by light I did receave From Cosmas eyes, which full in darkenes shine, I sawe her arme, where purest Lillies cleave. Nico. She once starke nak'd did bathe a little tine; But still (me thought) with beauties from her fell, She did the waters wash, and make more fine. Pas. She once, to coole her selfe, stood in a well, But ever since that well is well besought, And for Rose-water sould of rarest smell. Nico. To rivers banke, being on walking brought, She bad me spie her babie in the brooke, Alas (said I) this babe dooth nurce my thought. Pas. As in a glasse I held she once did looke, I said, my hands well paide her for mine eyes, Since in my hands selfe goodly sight she tooke. Nico. O if I had a ladder for the skies, I would climbe up, and bring a prettie starre, To weare upon her neck, that open lies. Pas. O if I had Apollos golden carre, I would come downe, and yeeld to her my place, That (shining now) she then might shine more farre. Nico. Nothing (O Leuca) shall thy fame deface, While shepheards tunes be heard, or rimes be read, Or while that shepheards love a lovely face. Pas. Thy name (O Cosma) shall with praise be spread, As farre as any shepheards piping be: As farre as Love possesseth any head. Nico. Thy monument is layd in many a tree, With name engrav'd: so though thy bodie die, The after-folkes shall wonder still at thee. Pas. So oft these woods have heard me Cosma crie, That after death, to heav'n in woods resound, With Echoes help, shall Cosma, Cosma flie. Nico. Peace, peace good Pas, thou weeriest even the ground With sluttish song: I pray thee learne to blea, For good thou mayst yet proove in sheepish sound. Pas. My father hath at home a prettie Jay, Goe winne of him (for chattering) praise or shame: For so yet of a conquest speake thou may. Nico. Tell me (and be my Pan) the monsters name, That hath foure legs, and with two onely goes, That hath foure eyes, and onely two can frame. Pas. Tell me (and PhÅbus be) what monster growes With so strong lives, that bodie cannot rest In ease, untill that bodie life forgoes. Dicus. Enough, enough: so ill hath done the best, That since the having them to neither's due, Let cat and dog fight which shall have both you. [I joye in griefe, and doo detest all joyes] Strephon. Klaius. Strephon. I joye in griefe, and doo detest all joyes: Despise delight, and tyrde with thought of ease I turne my minde to all formes of annoyes, And with the chaunge of them my fancie please. I studie that which may me most displease, And in despite of that displeasures might, Embrace that most, that most my soule destroyes. Blinded with beames, fell darkenes is my sight: Dole on my ruine feedes, with sucking smarte, I thinke from me, not from my woes to parte. Klaius. I thinke from me, not from my woes to parte, And loth this time, calld life, nay thinke, that life Nature to me for torment did emparte; Thinke, my harde haps have blunted deaths sharpe knife, Not sparing me, in whom his workes be rife: And thinking this, thinke Nature, Life, and Death Place Sorrowes triumph on my conquered brest: Whereto I yeeld, and seeke none other breath, But from the sent of some infectious grave: Nor of my fortune ought, but mischieve crave. Strephon. Nor of my fortune ought but mischiefe crave, And seeke to nourish that, which now contaynes All what I am: if I my selfe will save, Then must I save, what in me chiefly raignes, Which is the hatefull web of Sorowes paines. Sorow then cherish me, for I am sorowe: No being now, but sorowe I can have: Then decke me as thine owne; thy helpe I borowe, Since thou my riches arte, and that thou haste Enough to make a fertill minde lie waste. Klaius. Enough to make a fertill minde lie waste Is that huge storme, which powres it selfe on me: Hailestones of teares, of sighes a monstrous blast, Thunders of cries; lightnings my wilde lookes be, The darkened heav'n my soule which nought can see; The flying sprites which trees by rootes up teare Be those despaires, which have my hopes quite wast. The diffrence is; all folkes those stormes forbeare: But I cannot; who then my selfe should flie So close unto my selfe my wrackes doo lie. Strephon. So close unto my selfe my wrackes doo lie; Both cause, effect, beginning, and the ende Are all in me: what helpe then can I trie? My ship, my selfe; whose course to love doth bende, Sore beaten doth her mast of Comforte spende: Her cable, Reason, breakes from anchor, Hope: Fancie, her tackling, torne away doth flie: Ruine, the winde, hath blowne her from her scope: Brused with waves of Cares, but broken is On rocke, Despaire, the buriall of my blisse. Klaius. On rocke, Despaire, the buriall of my blisse I long doo plowe with plough of deepe Desire: The seed Fast-meaning is, no truth to misse: I harowe it with Thoughts, which all conspire Favour to make my chiefe and onely hire. But, woe is me, the yeare is gone about, And now I faine would reape, I reape but this, Hate fully growne, Absence new sprongen out. So that I see, although my sight empaire, Vaine is their paine, who labour in Despaire. Strephon. Vaine is their paine, who labour in Despaire. For so did I, when with my angle, Will, I sought to catch the fish Torpedo faire. Ev'n then Despaire did Hope already kill: Yet Fancie would perforce employ his skill, And this hath got; the catcher now is caught, Lamde with the angle, which it selfe did beare, And unto death, quite drownde in Dolours, brought To death, as then disguisde in her faire face. Thus, thus I had, alas, my losse in chase. Klaius Thus, thus I had, alas, my losse in chase, When first that crowned Basiliske I knewe, Whose footesteps I with kisses oft did trace, Till by such hap, as I must ever rewe, Mine eyes did light upon her shining hewe, And hers on me, astonisht with that sight. Since then my harte did loose his wonted place, Infected so with her sweet poysons might, That, leaving me for dead, to her it went: But ah her flight hath my dead reliques spent. Strephon. But ah her flight hath my dead reliques spent, Her flight from me, from me, though dead to me, Yet living still in her, while her beames lent Such vitall sparke, that her mine eyes might see. But now those living lights absented be, Full dead before, I now to dust should fall, But that eternall paines my soule should hent, And keepe it still within this body thrall: That thus I must, while in this death I dwell, In earthly fetters feele a lasting hell. Klaius. In earthly fetters feele a lasting hell Alas I doo; from which to finde release, I would the earth, I would the heavens fell. But vaine it is to thinke these paines should cease, Where life is death, and death cannot breed peace. O faire, Ã´ onely faire, from thee, alas, These foule, most foule, distresses to me fell; Since thou from me (Ã´ me) Ã´ Sunne didst passe. Therefore esteeming all good blessings toyes I joy in griefe, and doo detest all joyes. Strephon I joye in griefe, and doo detest all joyes. And now an ende, (Ã´ Claius) now an ende For even the hearbes our mournefull musique stroyes, And from our burning breath the trees doo bende.

[THE THIRD BOOKE OF THE COUNTESSE OF PEMBROKES ARCADIA.] [Unto a caitife wretch, whom long affliction holdeth] Unto a caitife wretch, whom long affliction holdeth, and now fully beleeves helpe to be quite perished; Grant yet, grant yet a looke, to the last monum?t of his anguish, O you (alas so I find) cause of his onely ruine. Dread not a whit (O goodly cruell) that pittie may enter into thy hart by the sight of this Epistle I send: And so refuse to behold of these strange wounds the recitall, least it might th'allure home to thy selfe to returne, (Unto thy selfe I do meane those graces dwell so within thee, gratefulnes, sweetnes, holy love, hartie regard) Such thing cannot I seeke (Despaire hath giv'n me my answer despaire most tragicall clause to a deadly request) Such thing c?not he hope, that knowes thy determinat hardnes; hard like a rich marble: hard, but a faire Diamond. Can those eyes that of eyes drownd in most harty flowing teares, (teares and teares of a man) had no returne to remorse; Can those eyes now yeeld to the kind conceit of a sorow, which inke onely relates, but ne laments, ne replies? Ah, that, that I do I not conceive (though that to my blisse were) more then Nestors yeares, more then a Kings diademe. Ah, that, that I do not c?ceive; to the heav? when a mouse climes then may I hope t'atchieve grace of a heavenly tiger. But, but alas, like a man c?demn'd doth crave to be heard speake not that he hopes for amends of the desaster he feeles, But finding th'approch of death with an ougly relenting, gives an adieu to the world, as to his onely delight: Right so my boiling hart, enflam'de with fire of a faire eye, bubling out doth breath signes of his hugie dolours: Now that he finds to what end his life and love be reserved, and that he hence must part where to live onely he lov'd. O faire, O fairest, are such thy triumphs to thy fairnesse? can death beautie become? must be such a monument? Must I be onely the marke, shall prove that Vertue is angrie? shall prove that fiercenes can with a white dove abide? Shall to the world appeare that faith and love be rewarded with mortall disdaine, bent to unendly revenge? Unto revenge? O sweete, on a wretch wilt thou be revenged? shall such high Plannets ende to the losse of a worme? And to revenge who doo bend, would in that kind be revenged, as th'offence was done, and goe beyond if he can. All my' offence was Love: with Love then must I be chastned, and with more, by the lawes that to Revenge doo belong. If that love be a fault, more fault in you to be lovely: Love never had me opprest, but that I saw to be lov'd. You be the cause that I lov'd: what Reason blameth a shadowe, that with a body't goes? since by a body it is. If that Love you did hate, you should your beautie have hidden: you should those faire eyes have with a veile covered. But foole, foole that I am, those eyes would shine fr? a dark cave. what veiles then doo prevaile, but to a more miracle? Or those golden lockes, those lockes which lock me to bondage, torne you should disperse unto the blasts of a winde. But foole, foole that I am, tho I had but a hair of her head fo?d, ev'n as I am, so I should unto that haire be a thrall. Or with fair h?ds-nailes (Ã´ h?d which nailes me to this death) you should have your face (since Love is ill) blemished. O wretch, what do I say? should that faire face be defaced? should my too-much sight cause so true a Sunne to be lost? First let Cimmerian darknes be my onel' habitacion: first be mine eyes pulde out, first be my braine perished; Ere that I should consent to doo such excessive a dammage unto the earth, by the hurt of this her heavenly jewell. O no: but such love you say you could have afoorded, as might learne Temp'rance voyde of a rages events. O sweet simplicitie: from whence should Love so be learned? unto Cupid that boy shall Pedante be found? Well: but faultie I was: Reason to my Passion yeelded, Passion unto my rage, Rage to a hastie revenge. But what's this for a fault, for which such fault is abolisht, such faith, so staineles, inviolate, violent? Shall I not? Ã´ may I not thus yet refresh the remembrance, what sweete joyes I had once, and what a place I did hold? Shall I not once object, that you, you graunted a favour unto the man, whom now such miseries you awarde? B?d your thoghts to the dear sweet words which th? to me giv'n were: think what a world is now, think who hath altred her hart. What? was I then worthie such good, now worthie such evill? now fled, then cherished? then so nie, now so remote? Did not a rosed breath, from lips more rosie proceeding, say, that I should well finde in what a care I was had? With much more: now what doo I finde, but Care to abhor me, Care that I sinke in griefe, Care that I live banished? And banished doo I live, nor now will seeke a recov'rie, since so she will, whose will is to me more then a lawe. If then a man in most ill case may give you a farewell; farewell, long farewell, all my woe, all my delight. [Amphialus song to Philoclea.] Now was our heav'nly vaulte deprived of the light With Sunnes depart: and now the darkenes of the night Did light those beamye stars which greater light did darke: Now each thing that enjoy'd that firie quickning sparke (Which life is cald) were mov'd their spirits to repose, And wanting use of eyes their eyes began to close: A silence sweet each where with one consent embraste (A musique sweet to one in carefull musing plaste) And mother Earth, now clad in mourning weeds, did breath A dull desire to kisse the image of our death: When I, disgraced wretch, not wretched then, did give My senses such reliefe, as they which quiet live, Whose braines broile not in woes, nor brests with beatings ake, With natures praise are wont in safest home to take. Far from my thoughts was ought, whereto their minds aspire, Who under courtly pompes doo hatch a base desire. Free all my powers were from those captiving snares, Which heav'nly purest gifts defile in muddy cares. Ne could my soule it selfe accuse of such a faulte, As tender conscience might with furious panges assaulte. But like the feeble flower (whose stalke cannot sustaine His weighty top) his top doth downeward drooping leane: Or as the silly birde in well acquainted nest Doth hide his head with cares but onely how to rest: So I in simple course, and unentangled minde Did suffer drousie lids mine eyes then cleare to blinde; And laying downe my head, did natures rule observe, Which senses up doth shut the senses to preserve. They first their use forgot, then fancies lost their force; Till deadly sleepe at length possest my living coarse. A living coarse I lay: but ah, my wakefull minde (Which made of heav'nly stuffe no mortal cha?ge doth blind) Flew up with freer wings of fleshly bondage free; And having plaste my thoughts, my thoughts thus placed me. Me thought, nay sure I was, I was in fairest wood Of Samothea lande; a lande, which whilom stood An honour to the world, while Honour was their ende, And while their line of yeares they did in vertue spende. But there I was, and there my calmie thoughts I fedd On Natures sweet repast, as healthfull senses ledd. Her giftes my study was, her beauties were my sporte: My worke her workes to know, her dwelling my resorte. Those lampes of heav'nly fire to fixed motion bound, The ever-turning spheares, the never-moving ground; What essence dest'nie hath; if fortune be or no; Whence our immortall soules to mortall earth doo flowe: What life it is, and how that all these lives doo gather, With outward makers force, or like an inward father. Such thoughts, me thought, I thought, and straind my single mind Then void of neerer cares, the depth of things to find. When lo with hugest noise (such noise a tower makes When it blowne downe with winde a fall of ruine takes) (Or such a noise it was, as highest thunders sende, Or canons thunder-like, all shot togither, lende) The Moone a sunder rent; whereout with sodaine fall (More swift then falcons stoope to feeding Falconers call) There came a chariot faire by doves and sparrowes guided: Whose stormelike course staid not till hard by me it bided. I wretch astonisht was, and thought the deathfull doome Of heaven, of earth, of hell, of time and place was come. But streight there issued forth two Ladies (Ladies sure They seemd to me) on whom did waite a Virgin pure: Straunge were the Ladies weeds; yet more unfit then strange. The first with cloth's tuckt up as Nymphes in woods do range; Tuckt up even with the knees, with bowe and arrowes prest: Her right arme naked was, discovered was her brest. But heavy was her pace, and such a meagre cheere, As little hunting minde (God knowes) did there appeere. The other had with arte (more then our women knowe, As stuffe meant for the sale set out to glaring showe) A wanton womans face, and with curld knots had twinde Her haire, which by the helpe of painters cunning, shinde. When I such guests did see come out of such a house, The mountaines great with childe I thought brought foorth a mouse. But walking forth, the first thus to the second saide, Venus come on: said she, Diane you are obaide. Those names abasht me much, wh? those great names I hard: Although their fame (me seemd) from truth had greatly jard. As I thus musing stood, Diana cald to her The waiting Nymphe, a Nymphe that did excell as farr All things that earst I sawe, as orient pearles exceed, That which their mother hight, or els their silly seed. Indeed a perfect hewe, indeed a sweet consent Of all those Graces giftes the heavens have ever lent. And so she was attirde, as one that did not prize Too much her peerles parts, nor yet could them despise. But cald, she came apace; a pace wherein did move The bande of beauties all, the little world of Love. And bending humbled eyes (Ã´ eyes the Sunne of sight) She waited mistresse will: who thus disclosd her spright. Sweet Mira mine (quoth she) the pleasure of my minde, In whom of all my rules the perfect proofe I finde, To onely thee thou seest we graunt this speciall grace Us to attend, in this most private time and place. Be silent therefore now, and so be silent still Of that thou seest: close up in secrete knot thy will. She answer'd was with looke, and well perform'd behest: And Mira I admirde: her shape sonke in my brest. But thus with irefull eyes, and face that shooke with spite Diana did begin. What mov'd me to invite Your presence (sister deare) first to my Moony spheare, And hither now, vouchsafe to take with willing eare. I know full well you know, what discord long hath raign'd Betwixt us two; how much that discord foule hath stain'd Both our estates, while each the other did deprave, Proofe speakes too much to us that feeling triall have. Our names are quite forgot, our temples are defac'd: Our offrings spoil'd, our priest from priesthood are displac'd Is this the fruite of strife? those thousand churches hie, Those thousand altars faire now in the dust to lie? In mortall mindes our mindes but planets names preserve: No knees once bowed, forsooth, for them they say we serve. Are we their servants growne? no doubt a noble staye: Celestiall powers to wormes, Joves children serve to claye. But such they say we be: this praise our discord bred, While we for mutuall spight a striving passion fed. But let us wiser be; and what foule discorde brake, So much more strong againe let fastest concorde make. Our yeares doo it require: you see we both doo feele The weakning worke of Times for ever-whirling wheele. Although we be divine, our grandsire Saturne is With ages force decay'd, yet once the heaven was his. And now before we seeke by wise Apollos skill Our young yeares to renew (for so he saith he will) Let us a perfect peace betweene us two resolve: Which lest the ruinous want of government dissolve; Let one the Princesse be, to her the other yeeld: For vaine equalitie is but contentions field. And let her have the giftes that should in both remaine: In her let beautie both, and chastnesse fully raigne. So as if I prevaile, you give your giftes to me: If you, on you I lay what in my office be. Now resteth onely this, which of us two is she, To whom precedence shall of both accorded be. For that (so that you like) hereby doth lie a youth (She beckned unto me) as yet of spotlesse truth, Who may this doubt discerne: for better, witt, then lot Becommeth us: in us fortune determines not. This crowne of amber faire (an amber crowne she held) To worthiest let him give, when both he hath beheld: And be it as he saith. Venus was glad to heare Such proffer made, which she well showd with smiling cheere. As though she were the same, as when by Paris doome She had chiefe Goddesses in beautie overcome. And smirkly thus gan say. I never sought debate Diana deare; my minde to love and not to hate Was ever apt: but you my pastimes did despise. I never spited you, but thought you overwise. Now kindnesse profred is, none kinder is then I: And so most ready am this meane of peace to trie. And let him be our judge: the lad doth please me well. Thus both did come to me, and both began to tell (For both togither spake, each loth to be behinde) That they by solemne oth their Deities would binde To stand unto my will: their will they made me know. I that was first agast, when first I saw their showe: Now bolder waxt, waxt prowde, that I such sway must beare: For neere acquaintance dooth diminish reverent feare. And having bound them fast by Styx, they should obaye To all what I decreed, did thus my verdict saye. How ill both you can rule, well hath your discord taught: Ne yet for ought I see, your beauties merite ought. To yonder Nymphe therefore (to Mira I did point) The crowne above you both for ever I appoint. I would have spoken out: but out they both did crie; Fie, fie, what have we done? ungodly rebell fie. But now we needs must yeelde, to that our othes require. Yet thou shalt not go free (quoth Venus) such a fire Her beautie kindle shall within thy foolish minde, That thou full oft shalt wish thy judging eyes were blinde. Nay then (Diana said) the chastnesse I will give In ashes of despaire (though burnt) shall make thee live. Nay thou (said both) shalt see such beames shine in her face That thou shalt never dare seeke helpe of wretched case. And with that cursed curse away to heaven they fled, First having all their giftes upon faire Mira spred. The rest I cannot tell, for therewithall I wak'd And found with deadly feare that all my sinewes shak'd. Was it a dreame? O dreame, how hast thou wrought in me, That I things erst unseene should first in dreaming see? And thou Ã´ traytour Sleepe, made for to be our rest, How hast thou framde the paine wherewith I am opprest? O cowarde Cupid thus doost thou thy honour keepe, Unarmde (alas) unwares to take a man asleepe? [The Fire to see my woes for anger burneth] The Fire to see my woes for anger burneth: The Aire in raine for my affliction weepeth: The Sea to ebbe for griefe his flowing turneth: The Earth with pitie dull his center turneth. Fame is with wonder blazed: Time runnes away for sorrow: Place standeth still amazed, To see my night of ils, which hath no morrowe. Alas all onely she no pitie taketh To know my miseries, but chaste and cruell My fall her glory maketh; Yet still her eyes give to my flames their fuell. Fire, burne me quite till sense of burning leave me: Aire, let me drawe thy breath no more in anguish: Sea, drown'd in thee of tedious life bereave me: Earth, take this earth wherein my spirits languish. Fame, say I was not borne: Time, hast my dying hower: Place, see my grave uptorne: Fire, aire, sea, earth, fame, time, place show your power. Alas from all their helpe I am exiled: For hers am I, and Death feares her displeasure. Fie Death thou art beguiled: Though I be hers, she sets by me no treasure. [Since that to death is gone the shepheard hie] Since that to death is gone the shepheard hie, Whom most the silly shepheards pipe did pryse, Your dolefull tunes sweete Muses now applie. And you Ã´ trees (if any life there lies In trees) now through your porous barkes receave The straunge resounde of these my causefull cries: And let my breath upon your braunches leave, My breath distinguish'd into wordes of woe, That so I may signes of my sorrowe leave. But if among yourselves some one tree growe, That aptest is to figure miserie, Let it embassage beare your grieves to showe. The weeping Myrrhe I thinke will not denie Her helpe to this, this justest cause of plaint. Your dolefull tunes sweet Muses now applie. And thou poore Earth, whom fortune doth attaint In Natures name to suffer such a harme, As for to loose thy gemme, and such a Sainct, Upon thy face let coaly Ravens swarme: Let all the Sea thy teares accounted be: Thy bowels with all killing mettals arme. Let golde now rust, let Diamonds waste in thee: Let pearls be wan with woe their damme doth beare: Thy selfe henceforth the light doo never see. And you, Ã´ flowers, which sometimes Princes were, Till these straunge altrings you did hap to trie, Of Princes losse your selves for tokens reare. Lilly in mourning blacke thy whitenes die: O Hiacinthe let Ai be on thee still. Your dolefull tunes sweet Muses now applie. O Echo, all these woods with roaring fill, And doo not onely marke the accents last, But all, for all reach out my wailefull will: One Echo to another Echo cast Sounde of my griefes, and let it never ende, Till that it hath all woods and waters past. Nay to the heav'ns your just complaining sende, And stay the starrs inconstant constant race, Till that they doo unto our dolours bende: And aske the reason of that speciall grace, That they, which have no lives, should live so long, And vertuous soules so soone should loose their place? Aske, if in great men good men doo so thronge, That he for want of elbowe roome must die? Or if that they be skante, if this be wronge? Did Wisedome this our wretched time espie In one true chest to rob all Vertues treasure? Your dolefull tunes sweete Muses now applie. And if that any counsell you to measure Your dolefull tunes, to them still playning say, To well felte griefe, plainte is the onely pleasure. O light of Sunne, which is entit'led day, O well thou doost that thou no longer bidest; For mourning light her blacke weedes may display. O PhÅbus with good cause thy face thou hidest, Rather then have thy all-beholding eye Fould with this sight, while thou thy chariot guidest. And well (me thinks) becomes this vaultie skie A stately tombe to cover him deceased. Your dolefull tunes sweet Muses now applie. O Philomela with thy brest oppressed By shame and griefe, helpe, helpe me to lament Such cursed harmes as cannot be redressed. Or if thy mourning notes be fully spent, Then give a quiet eare unto my playning: For I to teach the world complainte am bent. You dimmy clowdes, which well employ your stayning This cheerefull aire with your obscured cheere, Witnesse your wofull teares with daily rayning. And if, Ã´ Sunne, thou ever didst appeare, In shape, which by mans eye might be perceived; Vertue is dead, now set thy triumph here. Now set thy triumph in this world, bereaved Of what was good, where now no good doth lie; And by thy pompe our losse will be conceaved. O notes of mine your selves together tie: With too much griefe me thinkes you are dissolved. Your dolefull tunes sweete Muses now applie. Time ever old, and yonge is still revolved Within it selfe, and never tasteth ende: But mankind is for aye to nought resolved. The filthy snake her aged coate can mende, And getting youth againe, in youth doth flourish: But unto Man, age ever death doth sende. The very trees with grafting we can cherish, So that we can long time produce their time: But Man which helpeth them, helplesse must perish. Thus, thus the mindes, which over all doo clime, When they by yeares experience get best graces, Must finish then by deaths detested crime. We last short while, and build long lasting places: Ah let us all against foule Nature crie: We Natures workes doo helpe, she us defaces. For how can Nature unto this reply? That she her child, I say, her best child killeth? Your dolefull tunes sweete Muses now apply. Alas, me thinkes, my weakned voice but spilleth, The vehement course of this just lamentation: Me thinkes, my sound no place with sorrow filleth. I know not I, but once in detestation I have my selfe, and all what life containeth, Since Death on Vertues fort hath made invasion. One word of woe another after traineth: Ne doo I care how rude be my invention, So it be seene what sorrow in me raigneth. O Elements, by whose (men say) contention, Our bodies be in living power maintained, Was this mans death the fruite of your dissention? O Phisickes power, which (some say) hath restrained Approch of death, alas thou helpest meagerly, When once one is for Atropos distrained. Great be Physitions brags, but aid is beggerly, When rooted moisture failes, or groweth drie, They leave off al, and say, death comes too eagerlie. They are but words therefore that men do buy, Of any since God AEsculapius ceased. Your dolefull tunes sweete Muses now applie. Justice, justice is now (alas) oppressed: Bountifulnes hath made his last conclusion: Goodnes for best attire in dust is dressed. Shepheards bewaile your uttermost confusion; And see by this picture to you presented, Death is our home, life is but a delusion. For see alas, who is from you absented? Absented? nay I say for ever banished From such as were to dye for him contented? Out of our sight in turne of hand is vanished Shepherd of shepherds, whose well setled order Private with welth, publike with quiet garnished. While he did live, farre, farre was all disorder; Example more prevailing then direction, Far was homestrife, and far was foe from border. His life a law, his looke a full correction: As in his health we healthfull were preserved, So in his sicknesse grew our sure infection. His death our death. But ah; my Muse hath swarved, From such deepe plaint as should such woes descrie, Which he of us for ever hath deserved. The stile of heavie hart can never flie So high, as should make such a paine notorious: Cease Muse therfore: thy dart Ã´ Death applie; And farewell Prince, whom goodnesse hath made glorious. THE LAST PART OF SIR PHILIP SIDNEY'S ARCADIA FROM THE FOLIO OF 1593 [PhÃ¦bus farewell, a sweeter Saint I serve] PhÃ¦bus farewell, a sweeter Saint I serve, The high conceits thy heav'nly wisedomes breed My thoughts forget: my thoughts, which never swerve From her, in whome is sowne their freedomes seede, And in whose eyes my dayly doome I reede. PhÃ¦bus farewell, a sweeter Saint I serve. Thou art farre off, thy kingdome is above: She heav'n on earth with beauties doth preserve. Thy beames I like, but her cleare rayes I love: Thy force I feare, her force I still do prove. PhÃ¦bus yeelde up thy title in my minde. She doth possesse, thy Image is defaste, But if thy rage some brave revenge will finde, On her, who hath in me thy temple raste, Employ thy might, that she my fires may taste. And how much more her worth surmounteth thee, Make her as much more base by loving me. [Since that the stormy rage of passions darcke] Since that the stormy rage of passions darcke (Of passions darke, made darke of beauties light) Whith rebell force, hath closde in dungeon darke My minde ere now led foorth by reasons light: Since all the thinges which give mine eyes their light Do foster still, the fruites of fancies darke: So that the windowes of my inward light Do serve, to make my inward powers darke: Since, as I say, both minde and sences darke Are hurt, not helpt, with piercing of the light: While that the light may shewe the horrors darke But cannot make resolved darkenes lighte: I like this place, whereat the least the darke May keepe my thoughtes, from thought of wonted light. [Harke plaintfull ghostes, infernall furies harke] Harke plaintfull ghostes, infernall furies harke Unto my woes the hatefull heavens do sende, The heavens conspir'd, to make my vitall sparke A wreched wracke, a glasse of Ruines ende. Seeing, Alas; so mightie powers bende Their ireful shotte against so weake a marke, Come cave, become my grave, come death, and lende Receipte to me, within thy bosome darke. For what is life to dayly dieng minde, Where drawing breath, I sucke the aire of woe: Where too much sight, makes all the bodie blinde, And highest thoughts, downeward most headlong throw? Thus then my forme, and thus my state I finde, Death wrapt in flesh, to living grave assign'd. Like those sicke folkes, in whome strange humors flowe, Can taste no sweetes, the sower onely please: So to my minde, while passions daylie growe, Whose fyrie chaines, uppon his freedome seaze, Joies strangers seeme, I cannot bide their showe, Nor brooke oughte els but well acquainted woe. Bitter griefe tastes me best paine is my ease, Sicke to the death, still loving my disease. [Howe is my Sunn, whose beames are shining bright] Howe is my Sunn, whose beames are shining bright Become the cause of my darke ouglie night? Or howe do I captiv'd in this darke plight, Bewaile the case, and in the cause delight? My mangled mind huge horrors still doe fright, With sense possest, and claim'd by reasons right: Betwixt which two in me I have this fight, Wher who so wynns, I put my selfe to flight. Come clowdie feares close up my daseled sight, Sorrowes suck up the marowe of my might, Due sighes blowe out all sparkes of joyfull light, Tyre on despaier uppon my tyred sprite. An ende, an ende, my dulde penn cannot write, Nor mas'de head thinke, nor faltring tonge recite. This cave is darke, but it had never light. This waxe doth waste it selfe, yet painelesse dyes. These wordes are full of woes, yet feele they none. I darkned am, who once had clearest sight. I waste my harte, which still newe torment tryes. I plaine with cause, my woes are all myne owne, No cave, no wasting waxe, no wordes of griefe, Can holde, shew, tell, my paines without reliefe. [A banisht man, long bard from his desire] A banisht man, long bard from his desire By inward letts, of them his state possest, Hid heere his hopes, by which he might aspire To have his harmes with wisdomes helpe redrest. Seeke then and see, what man esteemeth best, All is but this, this is our labours hire, Of this we live, in this wee finde our rest, Who hold this fast no greater wealth require. Looke further then, so shalt thou finde at least, A baite most fit, for hungrie minded guest. [My true love hath my hart, and I have his] My true love hath my hart, and I have his, By just exchange, one for the other giv'ne. I holde his deare, and myne he cannot misse: There never was a better bargaine driv'ne. His hart in me, keepes me and him in one, My hart in him, his thoughtes and senses guides: He loves my hart, for once it was his owne: I cherish his, because in me it bides. His hart his wound receaved from my sight: My hart was wounded, with his wounded hart, For as from me, on him his hurt did light, So still me thought in me his hurt did smart: Both equall hurt, in this change sought our blisse: My true love hath my hart and I have his. [O words which fall like sommer deaw on me] O words which fall like sommer deaw on me, O breath more sweete, then is the growing beane, O toong in which, all honyed likoures bee, O voice that doth, the Thrush in shrilnes staine, Do you say still, this is her promise due, That she is myne, as I to her am true. Gay haire more gaie then straw when harvest lyes, Lips red and plum, as cherries ruddy side, Eyes faire and great, like faire great oxes eyes, O brest in which two white sheepe swell in pride: Joyne you with me, to seale this promise due, That she be myne, as I to her am true. But thou white skinne, as white as cruddes well prest, So smooth as sleekestone-like, it smoothes each parte, And thou deare flesh, as soft as wooll new drest, And yet as hard, as brawne made hard by arte: First fower but say, next fowr their saying seale, But you must pay, the gage of promist weale. [Do not disdaine, Ã´ streight up raised Pine] Do not disdaine, Ã´ streight up raised Pine That wounding thee, my thoughtes in thee I grave: Since that my thoughtes, as streight as streightnes thine No smaller wound, alas! farr deeper have. Deeper engrav'd, which salve nor time can save, Giv'ne to my harte, by my fore wounded eyne: Thus cruell to my selfe how canst thou crave My inward hurte should spare thy outward rine? Yet still faire tree, lifte up thy stately line, Live long, and long witnesse my chosen smarte, Which barde desires, (barde by my selfe) imparte And in this growing barke growe verses myne. My harte my worde, my worde hath giv'ne my harte. The giver giv'n from gifte shall never parte. [Sweete roote say thou, the roote of my desire] Sweete roote say thou, the roote of my desire Was vertue cladde in constant loves attire. [You goodly pines, which still with brave assent] You goodly pines, which still with brave assent In natures pride your heads to heav'nwarde heave, Though you besides such graces earth hath lent, Of some late grace a greater grace receave, By her who was (O blessed you) content, With her faire hande, your tender barkes to cleave, And so by you (O blessed you) hath sent, Such pearcing wordes as no thoughts els conceave: Yet yeeld your graunt, a baser hand may leave His thoughtes in you, where so sweete thoughtes were spent, For how would you the mistresse thoughts bereave Of waiting thoughts all to her service ment? Nay higher thoughtes (though thralled thoughtes) I call My thoughtes then hers, who first your ryne did rente. Then hers, to whom my thoughts a lonely thrall Rysing from lowe, are to the highest bente; Where hers, whom worth makes highest over all Comming from her, cannot but downewarde fall. [Like divers flowers, whose divers beauties serve] Pamela. Like divers flowers, whose divers beauties serve To decke the earth with his well-colourde weede, Though each of them, his private forme preserve, Yet joyning formes one sight of beautie breede. Right so my thoughts, where on my hart I feede: Right so my inwarde partes, and outward glasse, Though each possesse a divers working kinde, Yet all well knit to one faire end do passe: That he to whome, these sondrie giftes I binde All what I am, still one, his owne, doe finde. Musidorus. All what you are still one, his owne to finde, You that are borne to be the worldes eye, What were it els, but to make each thing blinde? And to the sunne with waxen winges to flie? No no, such force with my small force to trye Is not my skill, or reach of mortall minde. Call me but yours, my title is most hye: Holde me most yours, then my longe suite is signde. You none can clayme but you your selfe aright, For you do passe your selfe, in vertues might. So both are yours: I, bound with gaged harte: You onely yours, too farr beyond desarte. [Locke up, faire liddes, the treasure of my harte] Locke up, faire liddes, the treasure of my harte: Preserve those beames, this ages onely lighte: To her sweete sence, sweete sleepe some ease imparte, Her sence too weake to beare her spirits mighte. And while Ã´ sleepe thou closest up her sight, (Her sight where love did forge his fayrest darte) Ã´ harbour all her partes in easefull plighte: Let no strange dreme make her fayre body starte. But yet Ã´ dreame, if thou wilt not departe In this rare subject from the common right: But wilt thy selfe in such a seate delighte, Then take my shape, and play a lovers parte: Kisse her from me, and say unto her spirite, Till her eyes shine, I live in darkest night. [Why doost thou haste away] Why doost thou haste away O Titan faire the giver of the daie? Is it to carry newes To Westerne wightes, what starres in East appeare? Or doost thou thinke that heare Is left a Sunne, whose beames thy place may use? Yet stay and well peruse, What be her giftes, that make her equall thee, Bend all thy light to see In earthly clothes enclosde a heavenly sparke. Thy running course cannot such beawties marke: No, no, thy motions bee Hastened from us with barre of shadow darke, Because that thou the author of our sight Disdainst we see thee staind with others light. [O stealing time the subject of delaie] O stealing time the subject of delaie, (Delay, the racke of unrefrain'd desire) What strange dessein hast thou my hopes to staie My hopes which do but to mine owne aspire? Mine owne? Ã´ word on whose sweete sound doth pray My greedy soule, with gripe of inward fire: Thy title great, I justlie chalenge may, Since in such phrase his faith he did attire. O time, become the chariot of my joyes: As thou drawest on, so let my blisse draw neere. Each moment lost, part of my hap destroyes: Thou art the father of occasion deare: Joyne with thy sonne, to ease my long annoy's. In speedie helpe, thanke worthie frends appeare. [My Lute which in thy selfe thy tunes enclose] My Lute which in thy selfe thy tunes enclose, Thy mistresse song is now a sorrow's crie, Her hand benumde with fortunes daylie blows, Her minde amaz'de can neithers helpe applie. Weare these my words as mourning weede of woes, Blacke incke becommes the state wherein I dye. And though my mones be not in musicke bound, Of written greefes, yet be the silent ground. The world doth yeeld such ill consorted shows, With circkled course, which no wise stay can trye, That childish stuffe which knowes not frendes from foes, (Better despisde) bewondre gasing eye. Thus noble golde, downe to the bottome goes, When worthlesse corke, aloft doth floting lye. Thus in thy selfe, least strings are loudest founde, And lowest stops doo yeeld the hyest sounde. [When two Sunnes do appeare] When two Sunnes do appeare Some say it doth betoken wonders neare As Princes losse or change: Two gleaming Sunnes of splendour like I see, And seeing feele in me Of Princes harte quite lost the ruine strange. But nowe each where doth range With ouglie cloke the darke envious night: Who full of guiltie spite, Such living beames should her black seate assaile, Too weake for them our weaker sighte doth vaile. No saies faire moone, my lighte Shall barr that wrong, and though it not prevaile Like to my brothers raise, yet those I sende Hurte not the face, which nothing can amende. [Aurora now thou shewst thy blushing light] Aurora now thou shewst thy blushing light (Which oft to hope laies out a guilefull baite, That trusts in time, to finde the way aright To ease those paines, which on desire do waite) Blush on for shame: that still with thee do light On pensive soules (in steede of restfull baite) Care upon care (in steede of doing right) To over pressed brestes, more greevous waight. As oh! my selfe, whose woes are never lighte (Tide to the stake of doubt) strange passions baite, While thy known course, observing natures right Sturres me to thinke what dangers lye in waite. For mischeefes greate, daye after day doth showe: Make me still feare, thy faire appearing showe. [Beautie hath force to catche the humane sight.] Beautie hath force to catche the humane sight. Sight doth bewitch, the fancie evill awaked. Fancie we feele, encludes all passions mighte, Passion rebelde, oft reasons strength hath shaked. No wondre then, though sighte my sighte did tainte, And though thereby my fancie was infected, Though (yoked so) my minde with sicknes fainte, Had reasons weight for passions ease rejected. But now the fitt is past: and time hath giv'ne Leasure to weigh what due deserte requireth. All thoughts so spronge, are from their dwelling driv'n, And wisdome to his wonted seate aspireth. Crying in me: eye hopes deceitefull prove. Thinges rightelie prizde, love is the bande of love. [Let him drinke this, whome long in armes to folde] Let him drinke this, whome long in armes to folde Thou doest desire, and with free power to holde. [Get hence foule Griefe, the canker of the minde] Get hence foule Griefe, the canker of the minde: Farewell Complaint, the misers only pleasure: Away vayne Cares, by which fewe men do finde Their sought-for treasure. Ye helplesse Sighes, blowe out your breath to nought, Teares, drowne your selves, for woe (your cause) is wasted, Thought, thinke to ende, too long the frute of thought My minde hath tasted. But thou, sure Hope, tickle my leaping heart. Comfort, step thou in place of wonted sadnes. Fore-felt Desire, begin to savour parts Of comming gladnes. Let voice of Sighes into cleare musike runne, Eyes, let your Teares with gazing now be mended, In stede of Thought, true pleasure be begunne, And never ended. [Vertue, beawtie, and speach, did strike, wound, charme] Vertue, beawtie, and speach, did strike, wound, charme, My harte, eyes, eares, with wonder, love, delight: First, second, last, did binde, enforce, and arme, His workes, showes, suites, with wit, grace, and vow's might. Thus honour, liking, trust, much, farre, and deepe, Held, pearst, possest, my judgement, sence, and will, Till wrong, contempt, deceipt, did growe, steale, creepe, Bandes, favour, faith, to breake, defile, and kill. Then greefe, unkindnes, proofe, tooke, kindled, tought, Well grounded, noble, due, spite, rage, disdaine, But ah, alas! (In vayne) my minde, sight, thought, Doth him, his face, his words, leave, shunne, refraine, For no thing, time, nor place, can loose, quench, ease, Mine owne, embraced, sought, knot, fire, desease. [The love which is imprinted in my soule] The love which is imprinted in my soule With beauties seale, and vertue faire disguis'de, With inward cries putts up a bitter role Of huge complaintes, that now it is despis'de. Thus thus the more I love, the wronge the more Monstrous appeares, long trueth receaved late, Wrong sturres remorsed greefe, griefes deadly sore Unkindnes breedes, unkindnes fostreth hath. But ah the more I hate, the more I thinke Whome I doe hate, the more I thinke on him, The more his matchlesse giftes do deepely sinck Into my breste, and loves renewed swimme. What medicin then, can such desease remove Where love draws hate, and hate engendreth love? [Let mother earth now decke her selfe in flowers] Let mother earth now decke her selfe in flowers, To see her ofspring seeke a good increase, Where justest love doth vanquish Cupids powers And ware of thoughts is swallow'd up in peace Which never may decrease But like the turtells faire Live one in two, a well united paire, Which that no chaunce may staine, O Himen long their coupled joyes maintaine. O heav'n awake shewe forth thy stately face, Let not these slumbring clowds thy beawties hide, But with thy cheerefull presence helpe to grace The honest Bridegroome, and the bashfull Bride, Whose loves may ever bide, Like to the Elme and Vyne, With mutuall embracements them to twyne: In which delightfull paine, O Himen long their coupled joyes maintaine. Yee Muses all which chaste affects allow, And have to Thyrsis shewd your secret skill, To this chaste love your sacred favours bow, And so to him and her your giftes distill, That they all vice may kill: And like to lillies pure May please all eyes, and spotlesse may endure. Where that all blisse may raigne, O Himen long their coupled joyes maintaine. Yee Nymphes which in the waters empire have, Since Thyrsis musick oft doth yeeld you praise, Graunt to the thing which we for Thyrsis crave. Let one time (but long first) close up their daies, One grave their bodies seaze: And like two rivers sweete, When they though divers do together meete: One streame both streames containe, O Himen long their coupled joyes maintaine. Pan, father Pan, the god of silly sheepe, Whose care is cause that they in number growe, Have much more care of them that them do keepe, Since from these good the others good doth flowe, And make their issue showe In number like the hearde Of yonglings, which thy selfe with love hast rearde. Or like the drops of raine. O Himen long their coupled joyes maintaine. Vertue (if not a God) yet Gods chiefe parte, Be thou the knot of this their open vowe, That still he be her head, she be his harte, He leane to her, she unto him do bow: Each other still allow: Like Oke and Mistletoe. Her strength from him, his praise from her do growe. In which most lovely traine, O Himen long their coupled joyes maintaine. But thou foule Cupid syre to lawlesse lust, Be thou farre hence with thy empoyson'd darte, Which though of glittring golde, shall heere take rust Where simple love, which chastnesse doth imparte, Avoydes thy hurtfull arte, Not needing charming skill, Such mindes with sweet affections for to fill, Which being pure and plaine, O Himen long their coupled joyes maintaine. All churlish wordes, shrewd answeres, crabbed lookes, All privatenes, selfe-seeking, inward spite, All waywardnes, which nothing kindly brookes, All strife for toyes, and clayming masters right: Be hence aye put to flight, All sturring husbands hate Gainst neighbors good for womanish debate Be fled as things most vaine, O Himen long their coupled joyes maintaine. All peacock pride, and fruites of peacocks pride Longing to be with losse of substance gay With retchlesnes what may thy house betide, So that you may on hyer slippers stay For ever hence awaye: Yet let not sluttery, The sinke of filth, be counted huswifery: But keeping holesome meane, O Himen long their coupled joyes maintaine. But above all away vile jealousie, The evill of evils just cause to be unjust, (How can he love suspecting treacherie? How can she love where love cannot win trust?) Goe snake hide thee in dust, Ne dare once shew thy face, Where open hartes do holde so constant place, That they thy sting restraine, O Himen long their coupled joyes maintaine. The earth is deckt with flowers, the heav'ns displaid, Muses graunt guiftes, Nymphes long and joyned life, Pan store of babes, vertue their thoughts well staid, Cupids lust gone, and gone is bitter strife, Happy man, happy wife. No pride shall them oppresse, Nor yet shall yeeld to loathsome sluttishnes, And jealousie is slaine: For Himen will their coupled joyes maintaine. [A neighbor mine not long agoe there was] A neighbor mine not long agoe there was, (But namelesse he, for blamelesse he shall be) That married had a trick and bonny lasse As in a sommer day a man might see: But he himselfe a foule unhansome groome, And farre unfit to hold so good a roome. Now whether mov'd with selfe unworthines, Or with her beawtie fit to make a pray, Fell jealousie did so his braine oppresse, That if he absent were but halfe a day, He gest the worst (you wot what is the worst) And in himselfe new doubting causes nurst. While thus he fear'd the silly innocent, Who yet was good, because she knewe none ill, Unto his house a jollie shepeheard went, To whome our prince did beare a great good will, Because in wrestling and in pastorall He farre did passe the rest of Shepheards all. And therefore he a courtier was benamed, And as a courtier was with cheere receaved, (For they have toongs to make a poore man blamed. If he to them his dutie misconceaved) And for this Courtier should well like his table, The goodman bad his wife be serviceable. And so she was, and all with good intent, But fewe dayes past while she good maner us'de, But that her husband thought her service bent To such an end as he might be abus'de. Yet like a coward fearing strangers pride, He made the simple wench his wrath abide. With chumpish lookes, hard words, and secret nips, Grumbling at her when she his kindnes sought, Asking her how she tasted Courtiers lips, He forst her thinke that which she never thought. In fine he made her gesse, there was some sweet In that which he so fear'd that she should meet. When once this entred was, in womans hart, And that it had enflam'd a new desire, There rested then, to play a womans part, Fuell to seeke and not to quench the fire: But (for his jealous eye she well did finde) She studied cunning how the same to blinde. And thus she did. One day to him she came, And (though against his will) on him she leand, And out gan cry, ah well away for shame, If you helpe not our wedlocke will be staind, The goodman starting, askt what did her move? She sigh'd and sayd, the bad guest sought her love. He little looking that she should complaine Of that, whereto he feard she was enclinde, Bussing her oft, and in his hart full faine, He did demaunde what remedy to finde; How they might get that guest, from them to wend, And yet the prince (that lov'd him) not offend. Husband, quoth she, go to him by and by, And tell him you do finde I doo him love, And therefore pray him that of courtesie He will absent himselfe, least he should move A young girles hart, to that were shame for both, Whereto you knowe, his honest harte were loath. Thus shall you show that him you do not doubt, And as for me (sweete husband) I must beare. Glad was the man when he had heard her out, And did the same, although with mickle feare. For feare he did, least he the young man might In choller put, with whom he would not fight. The Courtlie shepheard much agast at this, Not seeing earst such token in the wife, Though full of scorne, would not his duty misse, Knowing that evill becommes a houshold strife, Did goe his way, but sojourn'd neere thereby, That yet the ground hereof he might espie. The wife thus having settled husbands braine, Who would have sworne his spowse Diana was, Watched when she a furder point might gaine, Which little time did fitlie bring to passe. For to the Courte her man was calld by name, Whither he needes must goe for feare of blame. Three dayes before that he must sure depart, She written had (but in a hand disguisde) A letter such which might from either part Seeme to proceede, so well it was devisde. She seald it first, then she the sealing brake, And to her jealous husband did it take. With weeping eyes (her eyes she taught to weepe) She told him that the Courtier had it sent: Alas, quoth she, thus womens shame doth creepe. The goodman read on both sides the content, It title had, Unto my only love, Subscription was, Yours most, if you will prove. The pistle selfe, such kinde of wordes it had, My sweetest joy, the comfort of my sprite, So may thy flockes encrease thy deere hart glad, So may each thing, even as thou wishest lighte, As thou wilt deigne to reade and gentlie reede This mourning inck, in which my hart doth bleede. Long have I lov'd, (alas thou worthy arte) Long have I lov'd, (alas love craveth love) Long have I lov'd thy selfe, alas my harte Doth breake, now toong unto thy name doth move, And thinke not that thy answere answere is, But that it is my doome of bale or blisse. The jealous wretch must now to Courte be gone: Ne can he faile, for prince hath for him sent: Now is the time we may be here alone, And geve a long desire a sweet content. Thus shall you both reward a lover true, And eke revenge his wrong suspecting you. And this was all, and this the husband read With chafe enough, till she him pacified: Desiring, that no griefe in him he bread Now that he had her words so truely tried: But that he would, to him the letter show That with his fault he might her goodnes know. That streight was done with many a boistrous threat, That to the King, he would his sinne declare, But now the Courtier gan to smell the feate, And with some words which shewed little care, He stayd untill the goodman was departed, Then gave he him the blow which never smarted. Thus may you see, the jealous wretch was made The Pandare of the thing, he most did feare, Take heed therefore, how you ensue that trade, Least the same markes of jealousie you beare. For sure, no jealousie can that prevent, Whereto two parties once be full content. [Who doth desire that chaste his wife should be] Who doth desire that chaste his wife should be, First be he true, for truth doth truth deserve: Then such be he, as she his worth may see, And one man still credit with her preserve. Not toying kinde, nor causlesly unkinde, Not sturring thoughts, nor yet denying right Not spying faults, nor in plaine errors blinde, Never hard hand, nor ever raines too light. As farre from want, as farre from vaine expence, (The one doth force, the later doth entise) Allow good company, but kepe from thence Al filthy mouth's that glory in their vice. This done, thou hast no more, but leave the rest To vertue, fortune, time &amp; womans brest. [The ladd Philisides] The ladd Philisides Lay by a rivers side, In flowry fielde a gladder eye to please: His pipe was at his foote His lambs were him besides, A widow turtle neere on bared rootes Sate wailing without bootes. Each thing both sweet &amp; sadd Did draw his boyling braine To thinke, &amp; thinke with paine Of Miras beames eclipst by absence bad. And thus, with eyes made dimme With teares, he saide, or sorrow said for him. O earth, once answere give, So may thy stately grace By north, or south still rich adorned live: So Mira Long may be On thy then blessed face, Whose foote doth set a heav'n on cursed thee, I aske, now answere me. If th'author of thy blisse PhÅbus, that shepheard high Do turne from thee his eye, Doth not thy selfe, when he long absent is, Like Rogue, all ragged goe, And pine away with daily wasting woe? Tell me you wanton brooke, So may your sliding race Shunn lothed-loving bankes with conning crooke: So in you ever new Mira may looke her face, And make you faire with shadow of her hue: So when to pay your due To mother sea you come, She chide you not for stay, Nor beat you for your play, Tell me if your diverted springs become Absented quite from you, Are you not dried? Can you your selves renew? Tell me you flowers faire Cowslipp &amp; Columbine, So may your Make this wholsome springtime aire With you embraced lie, And lately thence untwine: But with dew dropps engendre children hy: So may you never dy, But pulld by Miras hande Dresse bosome hers or hedd, Or scatter on her bedd, Tell me, if husband springtime leave your lande, When he from you is sent, Whither not you, languisht with discontent? Tell me my seely pipe, So may thee still betide A clenly cloth thy moistnes for to wipe: So may the cheries redd Of Miras lipps divide Their sugred selves to kisse thy happy hedd: So may her eares be ledd, Her eares where Musique lives, To heare, &amp; not despise The liribliring cries, Tell, if that breath, which thee thy sounding gives, Be absent farre from thee, Absent alone canst thou then piping be? Tell me my lamb of gold, So maist thou long abide The day well fed; the night in faithfull folde: So grow thy wooll of note, In time that richly di'de It may be part of Miras peticoate, Tell me, if wolves the throte Have cought of thy deare damme, Or she from thee be staide, Or thou from her be straide, Canst thou, poore lamme, become anothers lamme? Or rather till thou die Still for thy Dam with bea-waymenting crie? Tell me Ã´ Turtle true, So may no fortune breed To make thee nor thy better-loved rue: So may thy blessings swarme That Mira may thee feede With hand &amp; mouth, with lapp &amp; brest keepe warme, Tell me if greedy arme, Do fondly take away With traitor lime the one, The other left alone, Tell me poore wretch, parted from wretched pray Disdaine not you the greene, Wayling till death shun you not to be seene? Earth, brooke, flowr's, pipe, lambe, Dove Say all, &amp; I with them, Absence is death, or worse, to them that love. So I unlucky lad Whome hills from her do hemme, What fitts me now but teares, &amp; sighings sadd? O fortune too too badd, I rather would my sheepe Thad'st killed with a stroke, Burnt Caban lost my cloke, When want one hower those eyes which my joyes keepe. Oh! what doth wailing winne? Speeche without ende were better not begin. My song clime thou the winde Which holland sweet now gently sendeth in, That on his wings the leavell thou maist finde To hit, but Kissing hit Her ear's the weights of wit. If thou know not for whome thy Master dies, These markes shall make thee wise: She is the heardesse faire that shines in darke And gives her kidds no food, but willow's barke. This said, at length he ended, His oft sigh-broken dittie, Then raise, but raise on leggs: which faintnes bended, With skinne in sorrow died, With face the plot of pittie, With thoughts which thoughts their owne tormentors tried, He rase, &amp; streight espied His Ramme, who to recover The Ewe another loved, With him proud battell proved. He envied such a death in sight of lover, And alwaies westward eying More envied PhÅbus for his westerne flyinge. [As I my little flocke on Ister banke] As I my little flocke on Ister banke (A little flocke; but well my pipe the couthe) Did piping leade, the Sunne already sanke Beyond our worlde, and ere I got my boothe Each thing with mantle black the night doth scothe; Saving the glowe worme, which would curteous be Of that small light oft watching shepheards see. The welkin had full niggardly enclosed In cofer of dimme clowdes his silver groates, Icleped starres; each thing to rest disposed: The caves were full, the mountaines voide of goates: The birds eyes closd closed their chirping notes. As for the Nightingale woodmusiques King, It August was, he daynde not then to sing. Amid my sheepe, though I sawe nought to feare Yet (for I nothing sawe) I feared sore; Then founde I which thing is a charge to beare As for my sheepe I dradded mickle more Then ever for my selfe since I was bore. I sate me downe: for see to goe ne could, And sange unto my sheepe lest stray they should. The songe I sange old Lanquet had me taught, Lanquet, the shepheard best swift Ister knewe, For clerkly reed, and hating what is naught, For faithfull hart, cleane hands, and mouth as true: With his sweet skill my skillesse youth he drewe, To have a feeling tast of him that sitts Beyond the heaven, far more beyond your witts. He said, the Musique best thilke powers pleasd Was jumpe concorde betweene our wit and will: Where highest notes to godlines are raisd, And lowest sinke not downe to jote of ill: With old true tales: he woont mine eares to fill, How sheepheards did of yore, how now they thrive, Spoiling their flock, or while twixt them they strive. He liked me, but pitied lustfull youth: His good strong staffe my slippry yeares upbore: He still hop'd well, because he loved truth; Till forste to parte, with harte and eyes even sore, To worthy Coriden he gave me ore, But thus in okes true shade recounted he Which now in nights deepe shade sheep heard of me. Such maner time there was (what time I n'ot) When all this Earth, this damme or mould of ours Was onely won'd with such as beastes begot: Unknowne as then were they that builded towers: The cattell wild, or tame, in natures bowers Might freely rome, or rest, as seemed them: Man was not man their dwellings into hem. The beastes had sure some beastly pollicie: For nothing can endure where order n'is. For once the Lion by the Lambe did lie; The fearefull Hinde the Leopard did kisse: Hurtles was Tygers pawe and Serpents hisse. This thinke I well, the beasts with courage clad Like Senators a harmeles empire had. At which whether the others did repine, (For envie harbreth most in feeblest hartes) Or that they all to chaunging did encline, (As even in beasts their dammes leave chaunging partes) The multitude to Jove a suite empartes, With neighing, blaying, braying, and barking, Roring, and howling for to have a King. A King, in language theirs they said they would: (For then their language was a perfect speech) The birdes likewise with chirpes, and puing could Cackling, and chattering, that of Jove beseech. Onely the owle still warnde them not to seech So hastily that which they would repent: But sawe they would, and he to deserts went. Jove wisely said (for wisedome wisely sayes) O beasts, take heed what you of me desire. Rulers will thinke all things made them to please, And soone forget the swincke due to their hire, But since you will, part of my heav'nly fire I will you lende; the rest your selves must give, That it both seene and felte may with you live. Full glad they were and tooke the naked sprite, Which streight the Earth yclothed in his claye: The Lion, harte; the Ounce gave active might; The Horse, good shape; the Sparrow, lust to playe; Nightingale, voice, entising songes to saye. Elephant gave a perfect memorie: And Parot, ready tongue, that to applie. The Foxe gave crafte; the Dog gave flatterie; Asse, pacience; the Mole, a working thought; Eagle, high looke; Wolfe secrete crueltie: Monkie, sweet breath; the Cow, her faire eyes brought; The Ermion, whitest skinne, spotted with nought; The sheep, mild-seeming face; climing, the Beare; The Stagge did give the harme eschewing feare. The Hare, her sleights; the Cat, his melancholie; Ante, industrie; and Connie, skill to builde; Cranes, order; Storkes, to be appearing holie; CamÃ¦leon, ease to chaunge; Ducke, ease to yelde; Crocodile, teares, which might be falsely spilde: Ape great thing gave, though he did mowing stand, The instrument of instruments, the hand. Ech other beast likewise his present brings: And (but they drad their Prince they ought should want) They all consented were to give him wings: And aye more awe towards him for to plant, To their owne worke this priviledge they graunt, That from thenceforth to all eternitie, No beast should freely speake, but onely he. Thus Man was made; thus Man their Lord became: Who at the first, wanting, or hiding pride, He did to beastes best use his cunning frame; With water drinke, herbes meate, and naked hide, And fellow-like let his dominion slide; Not in his sayings saying I, but we: As if he meant his lordship common be. But when his seate so rooted he had found, That they now skilld not, how from him to wend; Then gan in guiltlesse earth full many a wound, Iron to seeke, which gainst it selfe should bend, To teare the bowels, that good corne should send. But yet the common Damme none did bemone; Because (though hurt) they never heard her grone. Then gan the factions in the beastes to breed; Where helping weaker sort, the nobler beastes, (As Tygers, Leopards, Beares, and Lions seed) Disdaind with this, in deserts sought their restes; Where famine ravine taught their hungrie chestes, That craftily he forst them to do ill, Which being done he afterwards would kill. For murthers done, which never erst was seene, By those great beastes, as for the weakers good, He chose themselves his guarders for to bene, Gainst those of might, of whom in feare they stood, As horse and dogge, not great, but gentle blood: Blith were the commons cattell of the fielde, Tho when they saw their foen of greatnes kilde. But they or spent, or made of slender might, Then quickly did the meaner cattell finde, The great beames gone, the house on shoulders light: For by and by the horse faire bitts did binde: The dogge was in a coller taught his kinde. As for the gentle birds like case might rewe When falcon they, and gossehauke saw in mewe. Worst fell to smallest birds, and meanest heard, Whom now his owne, full like his owne he used. Yet first but wooll, or fethers off he teard: And when they were well us'de to be abused, For hungrie teeth their flesh with teeth he brused: At length for glutton taste he did them kill: At last for sport their sillie lives did spill. But yet Ã´ man, rage not beyond thy neede: Deeme it no glorie to swell in tyrannie. Thou art of blood; joy not to see things bleede: Thou fearest death; thinke they are lothe to die. A plaint of guiltlesse hurt doth pierce the skie. And you poore beastes, in patience bide your hell, Or know your strengths, and then you shall do well. Thus did I sing, and pipe eight sullen houres To sheepe, whom love, not knowledge, made to heare, Now fancies fits, now fortunes balefull flowers: But then I homewards call'd my lambkins deare: For to my dimmed eyes began t'appeare The night growne old, her blacke head waxen gray, Sure shepherds signe, that morne should soone fetch day. [In faith, good Histor, long is your delay] Geron. Histor. Geron. In faith, good Histor, long is your delay, From holy marriage sweete and surest meane: Our foolish lust in honest rules to stay. I pray thee doo to Lalus sample leane: Thou seest, how friske, and jolly now he is, That last day seem'd, he could not chew a beane. Beleeve me man, there is no greater blisse, Then is the quiet joy of loving wife; Which who so wants, halfe of himselfe doth misse. Friend without change, playfellow without strife, Foode without fulnes, counsaile without pride, Is this sweet doubling of our single life. Histor. No doubt to whom so good chance did betide, As for to finde a pasture strawed with golde, He were a foole, if there he did not bide. Who would not have a PhÅnix if he could? The humming Waspe, if it had not a sting, Before all flies the Waspe accept I would. But this bad world, few golden fieldes doth bring, PhÅnix but one, of Crowes we millions have: The Waspe seemes gay, but is a combrous thing. If many Kalaes our Arcadia gave, Lalus example I would soone ensue, And thinke, I did my selfe from sorrow save. But of such wives we finde a slender crew; Shrewdnes so stirres, pride so puffes up the hart, They seldome ponder what to them is due. With meager lookes, as if they still did smart; Puiling, and whimpring, or else scolding flat, Make home more paine then following of the cart. Either dull silence, or eternall chat; Still contrarie to what her husband sayes; If he do praise the dog, she likes the cat. Austere she is, when he would honest playes; And gamesome then, when he thinkes on his sheepe; She bids him goe, and yet from jorney stayes. She warre doth ever with his kinsfolke keepe, And makes them fremb'd, who friends by nature are, Envying shallow toyes with malice deepe. And if forsooth there come some new found ware, The little coine his sweating browes have got, Must goe for that, if for her lowres he care: Or els; Nay faith, mine is the lucklest lot, That ever fell to honest woman yet: No wife but I hath such a man, God wot. Such is their speech, who be of sober wit; But who doo let their tongues shew well their rage, Lord, what bywords they speake, what spite they spit? The house is made a very lothsome cage, Wherein the birde doth never sing but cry; With such a will as nothing can asswage. Dearely the servants doo their wages buy, Revil'd for ech small fault, sometimes for none: They better live that in a gaile doo lie. Let other fowler spots away be blowne; For I seeke not their shame, but still me thinkes, A better life it is to lye alone. Geron. Who for ech fickle feare from vertue shrinkes, Shall in his life embrace no worthy thing: No mortall man the cuppe of suretie drinkes. The heav'ns doo not good haps in handfuls bring, But let us pike our good from out much bad: That still our little world may know his king. But certainly so long we may be glad, While that we doo what nature doth require, And for th'event we never ought be sad. Man oft is plag'de with aire, is burnt with fire, In water drownd, in earth his buriall is; And shall we not therefore their use desire? Nature above all things requireth this, That we our kind doo labour to maintaine; Which drawne-out line doth hold all humane blisse. Thy father justly may of thee complaine, If thou doo not repay his deeds for thee, In granting unto him a grandsires gaine. Thy common-wealth may rightly grieved be, Which must by this immortall be preserved, If thus thou murther thy posteritie. His very being he hath not deserved, Who for a selfe-conceipt will that forbeare, Whereby that being aye must be conserved. And God forbid, women such cattell were, As you paint them: but well in you I finde, No man doth speake aright, who speakes in feare. Who onely sees the ill is worse then blind. These fiftie winters maried have I beene; And yet finde no such faults in womankind. I have a wife worthie to be a Queene, So well she can command, and yet obay; In ruling of a house so well shee's seene. And yet in all this time betwixt us tway, We beare our double yoke with such consent, That never past foule word, I dare well say. But these be your love-toyes, which still are spent In lawlesse games, and love not as you should, But with much studie learne late to repent. How well last day before our Prince you could Blinde Cupids workes with wonder testifie? Yet now the roote of him abase you would. Goe to, goe to, and Cupid now applie To that where thou thy Cupid maist avowe, And thou shalt finde, in women vertues lie. Sweete supple mindes which soone to wisdome bowe Where they by wisdomes rule directed are, And are not forst fonde thraldome to allow. As we to get are fram'd, so they to spare: We made for paine, our paines they made to cherish: We care abroad, and they of home have care. O Histor, seeke within thy selfe to flourish: Thy house by thee must live, or els be gone: And then who shall the name of Histor nourish? Riches of children passe a Princes throne; Which touch the fathers hart with secret joy, When without shame he saith, these be mine owne. Marrie therefore; for marriage will destroy Those passions which to youthfull head doo clime, Mothers and Nurses of all vaine annoy. The ende of the third Booke. THE FOURTH BOOKE OF THE COUNTESSE OF PEMBROKES ARCADIA. [Who hath his hire, hath well his labour plast] Who hath his hire, hath well his labour plast: Earth thou didst seeke, and store of earth thou hast. [O night the ease of care the pledge of pleasure] O night the ease of care the pledge of pleasure, Desires best meane, harnest of hartes affected, The seate of peace, the throne which is erected Of humane life to be the quiet measure, Be victor still of PhÅbus golden treasure: Who hath our sight with too much sight infected, Whose light is cause we have our lives neglected Turning all natures course to selfe displeasure. These stately starrs in their now shining faces, With sinlesse sleepe, and silence wisdomes mother, Witnesse his wrong which by thy helpe is eased: Thou arte therefore of these our desart places The sure refuge, by thee and by no other My soule is bliste, sence joyde, and fortune raysed. [Since wayling is a bud of causefull sorowe] Since wayling is a bud of causefull sorowe, Since sorow is the follower of evill fortune, Since no evill fortune equalls publique damage: Now Princes losse hath made our damage publique, Sorow, pay we to thee the rights of Nature, And inward griefe seale up with outward wailing. Why should we spare our voice from endlesse wailing, Who justly make our hearts the seate of sorow? In such a case where it appeares that nature Doth add her force unto the sting of fortune: Choosing alas! this our theatre publique, Where they would leave trophees of cruell damage, Then since such pow'rs conspir'd unto our damage (Which may be know'n, but never help't with wailing) Yet let us leave a monument in publique Of willing teares, torne haires, &amp; cries of sorrow. For lost, lost is by blowe of cruell fortune Arcadias gemme the noblest childe of nature, O nature doting olde, Ã´ blinded nature, How hast thou torne thy selfe! sought thine owne damage! In graunting such a scope to filthy fortune, By thy impes losse to fill the world with wai'ling. Cast thy stepmother eyes upon our sorowe, Publique our losse: so, see, thy shame is publique. O that we had, to make our woes more publique, Seas in our eyes, &amp; brasen tongues by nature, A yelling voice, &amp; heartes compos'd of sorow, Breath made of flames, wits knowing nought but damage, Our sports murdering our selves, our musiques wailing, Our studies fixt upon the falles of fortune. No, no, our mischiefe growes in this vile fortune, That private paines can not breath out in publique The furious inward griefes with hellish wailing: But forced are to burthen feeble nature With secret sense of our eternall damage, And sorow feede, feeding our soules with sorow. Since sorow then concludeth all our fortune With all our deathes shew we this damage publique. His nature feares to die who lives still wailing. [Since that to death is gone the shepheard hie] Since that to death is gone the shepheard hie, Who most the silly shepheards pipe did pryse, Your dolefull tunes sweete Muses now applie. And you Ã´ trees (if any life there lies In trees) now through your porous barkes receave The straunge resounde of these my causefull cries: And let my breath upon your braunches cleave, My breath distinguish'd into wordes of woe, That so I may signes of my sorrowe leave. But if among your selves some one tree growe, That aptest is to figure miserie, Let it embassage beare your grieves to showe. The weeping Mirrhe I thinke will not denie Her helpe to this, this justest cause of plaint. Your dolefull tunes sweet Muses now applie. And thou poore Earth, whom fortune doth attaint In Natures name to suffer such a harme, As for to loose thy gemme, and such a Sainct, Upon thy face let coaly Ravens swarme: Let all the Sea thy teares accounted be: Thy bowels with all killing mettals arme. Let golde now rust, let Diamonds waste in thee: Let pearls be wan with woe their damme doth beare: Thy selfe henceforth the light doo never see. And you, Ã´ flowers, which sometimes Princes were, Till these straunge altrings you did hap to trie, Of Princes losse your selves for tokens reare, Lilly in mourning blacke thy whitenes die: O Hyacinthe let Ai be on thee still. Your dolefull tunes sweet Muses now applie. O Echo, all these woods with roaring fill, And doo not onely marke the accents last, But all, for all reach out my wailefull will: One Echo to another Echo cast Sounde of my griefes, and let it never ende, Till that it hath all woods and waters past. Nay to the heav'ns your just complaining sende, And stay the starrs inconstant constant race, Till that they doo unto our dolours bende: And aske the reason of that speciall grace, That they, which have no lives, should live so long, And vertuous soules so soone should loose their place? Aske, if in great men good men doo so thronge, That he for want of elbowe roome must die? Or if that they be skante, if this be wronge? Did Wisedome this our wretched time espie In our true chest to rob all Vertues treasure? Your dolefull tunes sweete Muses now applie. And if that any counsell you to measure Your dolefull tunes, to them still playning say, To well felte griefe, plainte is the onely pleasure. O light of Sunne, which is entit'led day, O well thou doost that thou no longer bidest; For mourning light her blacke weedes may display. O PhÅbus with good cause thy face thou hidest, Rather then have thy all-beholding eye Fould with this sight, while thou thy chariot guidest. And well (me thinks) becomes this vaultie skie A stately tombe to cover him deceased. Your dolefull tunes sweet Muses now applie. O Philomela with thy brest oppressed By shame and griefe, helpe, helpe me to lament Such cursed harmes as cannot be redressed. Or if thy mourning notes be fully spent, Then give a quiet eare unto my playning: For I to teach the world complainte am bent. You dimmy clowdes, which well employ your stayning This cheerefull aire with your obscured cheere, Witnesse your wofull teares with dayly rayning. And if, Ã´ Sinne, thou ever didst appeare, In shape, which by mans eye might be perceaved; Vertue is dead, now set the triumph here. Now set thy triumph in this world, bereaved Of what was good, where now no good doth lie; And by the pompe our losse will be conceaved. O notes of mine your selves together tie: With too much griefe me thinkes you are dissolved. Your dolefull tunes sweet Muses now applie, Time ever old, and yong is still revolved Within it selfe, and never tasteth ende: But mankind is for aye to nought resolved. The filthy snake her aged coate can mende, And getting youth againe, in youth doth flourish: But unto Man, age ever death doth sende. The very trees with grafting we can cherish, So that we can long time produce their time: But Man which helpeth them, helplesse must perish. Thus, thus the mindes, which over all doo clime, When they by yeares experience get best graces, Must finish then by deaths detested crime. We last short while, and build long lasting places: Ah let us all against foule Nature crie: We Natures workes doo helpe, she us defaces. For how can Nature unto this reply? That she her child, I say, her best child killeth? Your dolefull tunes sweete Muses now apply. Alas, me thinkes, my weakned voice but spilleth, The vehement course of this just lamentation: Me thinkes, my sound no place with sorrow filleth. I know not I, but once in detestation I have my selfe, and all what life containeth, Since Death on Vertues fort hath made invasion. One word of woe another after traineth: Ne doo I care how rude be my invention, So it be seene what sorrow in me raigneth. O Elements, by whose (men say) contention, Our bodies be in living power maintained, Was this mans death the fruite of your dissention? O Phisickes power, which (some say) hath restrained Approch of death, alas thou helpest meagerly, When once one is for Atropos distrained. Great be Physitions brags, but aid is beggerly, When rooted moisture failes, or groweth drie, They leave off all, and say, death commes too eagerlie. They are but words therefore that men do buy Of any, since God Ãsculapius ceased. Your dolefull tunes sweete Muses now apply. Justice, justice is now (alas) oppressed: Bountifulnes hath made his last conclusion: Goodnes for best attire in dust is dressed. Shepheards bewaile your uttermost confusion; And see by this picture to you presented, Death is our home, life is but a delusion. For see alas, who is from you absented? Absented? nay I say for ever banished From such as were to dye for him contented? Out of our sight in turne of hand is vanished Shepherd of shepherds, whose well setled order Private with welth, publike with quiet garnished. While he did live, farre, farre was all disorder; Example more prevailing then direction, Far was homestrife, and far was foe from border. His life a law, his looke a full correction: And in his health we healthfull were preserved, So in his sicknesse grew our sure infection. His death our death. But ah; my Muse hath swarved, From such deepe plaint as should such woes descrie, Which he of us for ever hath deserved. The stile of heavie hart can never flie So high, as should make such a paine notorious: Cease Muse therfore: thy dart Ã´ Death applie; And farewell Prince, whom goodnesse hath made glorious. [Farewell Ã´ Sunn, Arcadias clearest light] Farewell Ã´ Sunn, Arcadias clearest light: Farewell Ã´ pearl, the poore mans plenteous treasure: Farewell Ã´ golden staffe, the weake mans might: Farewell Ã´ Joy, the joyfulls onely pleasure. Wisdome farewell, the skillesse mans direction: Farewell with thee, farewell all our affection. For what place now is lefte for our affection, Now that of purest lampe is quench'd the light, Which to our darkned mindes was best direction? Now that the mine is lost of all our treasure? Now death hath swallow'd up our worldly pleasure, We Orphans made, void of all publique might? Orphans indeede, depriv'd of fathers might: For he our father was in all affection, In our well-doing placing all his pleasure, Still studying how to us to be a light. As well he was in peace a safest treasure: In warr his wit &amp; word was our direction. Whence, whence alas, shall we seeke our direction! When that we feare our hatefull neighbours might, Who long have gap't to get Arcadians treasure. Shall we now finde a guide of such affection, Who for our sakes will thinke all travaile light, And make his paine to keepe us safe his pleasure? No, no, for ever gone is all our pleasure; For ever wandring from all good direction; For ever blinded of our clearest light; For ever lamed of our sured might; For ever banish'd from well plac'd affection; For ever robd of all our royall treasure. Let teares for him therefore be all our treasure, And in our wailfull naming him our pleasure: Let hating of our selves be our affection, And unto death bend still our thoughts direction. Let us against our selves employ our might, And putting out our eyes seeke we our light. Farewell our light, farewell our spoiled treasure: Farewell our might, farewell our daunted pleasure: Farewell direction, farewell all affection. The ende of the fourth Booke.

[Since natures workes be good, and death doth serve] Since natures workes be good, and death doth serve As natures worke: why should we feare to dye? Since feare is vaine, but when it may preserve, Why should we feare, that which we cannot flye? Feare is more paine, then is the paine it feares, Disarming humane mindes, of native might: While each conceate, an ouglie figure beares, Which were not evill, well vew'd in reasons light. Our owly eyes, which dimm'd with passions bee, And scarce discerne the dawne of comming day, Let them be clearde, and now begin to see, Our life is but a step, in dustie way.

[âFortune, Nature, Love, long have contended about me] Dorus. âFortune, Nature, Love, long have contended about me, Which should most miseries, cast on a worme that I am. âFortune thus gan say; misery and misfortune is all one, And of misfortune, fortune hath only the gift. âWith strong foes on land, on seas with contrary tempests Still doo I crosse this wretch, what so he taketh in hand. âTush, tush, said nature, this is all but a trifle, a mans selfe Gives happs or mishapps, ev'n as he ordreth his hearte. âBut so his humor I frame, in a mould of choller adusted, That the delights of life shall be to him dolorouse. âLove smiled, and thus said; Want joynd to desire is unhappy. But if he nought do desire, what can Heraclitus aile? âNone but I, workes by desire: by desire have I kindled in his soule Infernall agonies unto a bewtye divine, âWhere thou poore nature left'st all thy due glory, to fortune Her vertue is soveraine, fortune a vassal of hers. âNature abasht went back: fortune blusht: yet she replide thus: And ev'n in that love, shall I reserve him a spite. âThus, thus, alas! wofull in nature, unhappy by fortune, But most wretched I am, now love awakes my desire. Dorus. Zelmane. Dorus. Lady reservd by the heav'ns to do pastors company honnor, Joyning your sweete voice to the rurall muse of a deserte, Here you fully do finde this strange operation of love, How to the woods love runnes as well as rydes to the Pallace, Neither he beares reverence to a Prince nor pittie to begger, But (like a point in midst of a circle) is still of a neernesse, All to a lesson he draw's, nether hills nor caves can avoide him. Zelmane Worthy shepeheard by my song to my selfe all favor is happned, That to the sacred Muse my anoyes somewhat be revealed, Sacred Muse, who in one contaynes what nine do in all them. But Ã´ happy be you, which safe from fyry reflection Of PhÅbus violence in shade of sweet Cyparissus, Or pleasant mirtell, may teach th'unfortunate Echo In these woods to resounde the renowmed name of a goddesse. Happy be you that may to the saint, your onely Idea, (Although simply atyrde) your manly affection utter. Happy be those mishapps which justly proportion holding Give right sound to the eares, and enter aright to the judgement, But wretched be the soules, which vaild in a contrary subject: How much more we do love, so the lesse our loves be beleeved. What skill salveth a soare of a wrong infirmity judged? What can justice availe, to a man that tells not his owne case? You though feares do abash, in you still possible hopes be: Nature against we do seeme to rebell, seeme fooles in a vaine sute. But so unheard, condemn'd, kept thence we do seeke to abide in, Selfe-lost in wandring, banished that place we doe come from, What meane is there, alas, we can hope our losse to recover? What place is there left, we may hope our woes to recomfort? Unto the heav'ns? our wings be too short: earth thinks us a burden. Aire we do still with sighes encrease, to the fire? we do want none. And yet his outward heate our teares would quench, but an inward Fire no liquor can coole: Neptunes realme would not availe us. Happy shepheard, with thanks to the Gods, still thinke to be thankfull, That to thy advauncement their wisdomes have thee abased. Dorus. Unto the Gods with a thanckfull heart all thankes I do render, That to my advauncement their wisdomes have me abased. But yet, alas! O but yet alas! our happs be but hard happs, Which must frame contempt to the fittest purchase of honnour. Well may a Pastor plaine, but alas his plaints be not esteem'de Silly shepheards poore pype, when his harsh sound testifi's anguish, Into the faire looker on, pastime, not passion, enters. And to the woods or brookes, who do make such dreery recitall What be the pangs they beare, and whence those pangs be derived, Pleasd to receave that name by rebounding answere of Echo, May hope therby to ease their inward horrible anguish, When trees daunce to the pype, and swift streames stay by the musicke, Or when an Echo begins unmov'd to sing them a love song. Say then what vantage do we get, by the trade of a Pastor? (Since no estates be so base, but love vouchsafeth his arrow, Since no refuge doth serve from woundes we do carry about us, Since outward pleasures be but halting helpes to decayd soules) Save that dayly we may discerne what fire we do burne in. Farre more happy be you, whose greatnes gets a free accesse, Whose faire bodily gifts are fram'd most lovely to each ey. Vertue you have, of vertue you have left proofe to the whole world. And vertue is gratefull with bewty and richnes adorned, Neither doubt you awhit, time will your passion utter. Hardly remains fyer hid, where skill is bent to the hiding, But in a minde that would his flames should not be repressed, Nature worketh enough with a small help for the revealing. Give therefore to the Muse great praise in whose very likenes You doo approch to the fruite your onely desir's be to gather. Zelmane. First shall fertill grounds not yeeld increase of a good seed: First the rivers shall ceasse to repay their fludds to the Occean: First may a trusty Greyhounde transforme himselfe to a Tigre: First shall vertue be vice, and bewty be counted a blemishe, Ere that I leave with song of praise her praise to solemnize, Her praise, whence to the world all praise hath his only beginning: But yet well I doo finde each man most wise in his owne case. None can speake of a wound with skill, if he have not a wound felt. Great to thee my state seemes, thy state is blest by my judgement: And yet neither of us great or blest deemeth his owne selfe. For yet (weigh this alas!) great is not great to the greater. What judge you doth a hillocke shew, by the lofty Olympus? Such my minute greatnes, doth seeme compar'd to the greatest. When Cedars to the ground fall downe by the weight of an emmott, Or when a rich rubies just price be the worth of a walnut, Or to the Sun for wonders seeme small sparks of a candle: Then by my high Cedar, rich Ruby, and only shining Sunne, Vertue, richesse, beawties of mine shall great be reputed. Oh no, no, worthy shepeheard, worth can never enter a title, Where proofes justly do teach, thus matcht, such worth to be nought worth, Let not a puppet abuse thy sprite, Kings Crownes do not helpe them From the cruell headache, nor shooes of golde doo the gowt heale, And preciouse couches full oft are shak't with a feaver. If then a boddily evill in a boddily gloze be not hidden, Shall such morning deaws be an ease to the heate of a loves fire? Dorus. O glittring miseries of man, if this be the fortune Of those fortune lulls? so small rest rests in a kingdome? What marvaile tho a Prince transforme himselfe to a Pastor? Come from marble bowres many times the gay harbor of anguish, Unto a silly caban, though weake, yet stronger against woes. Now by thy words I begin, most famous Lady, to gather Comfort into my soule I do finde, I do find what a blessing Is chaunced to my life, that from such muddy abundance Of carking agonies (to states which still be adherent) Desteny keepes me aloofe, for if all this state to thy vertue Joyn'd, by thy beauty adorn'd be no meanes these greefes to abolish: If neither by that helpe, thou canst clime up to thy fancie, Nor yet fancy so drest do receive more plausible hearing: Then do I thinke in deed, that better it is to be private In sorrows torments, then, tyed to the pompes of a pallace, Nurse inwarde maladyes, which have not scope to be breath'd out. But perforce disgest, all bitter joyces of horror In silence, from a mans owne selfe with company robbed. Better yet do I live, that though by my thoughts I be plunged Into my lives bondage, yet may disburden a passion (Opprest with ruinouse conceites) by the helpe of an outcrye: Not limited to a whispringe note, the Lament of a Courtier. But sometimes to the woods somtimes to the heav'n do decyphire With bolde clamor unheard, unmarckt, what I seeke what I suffer: And when I meete these trees, in the earths faire livory clothed, Ease I do feele (such ease as falls to one wholy diseased) For that I finde in them parte of my state represented. Lawrell shew's what I seeke, by the Mirre is show'd how I seeke it, Olive paintes me the peace that I must aspire to by the conquest: Mirtle makes my request, my request is crown'd with a willowe? Cyprus promiseth helpe, but a helpe where comes no recomforte Sweete Juniper, saith this, thoh I burne, yet I burne in a sweete fire. Ewe doth make me thinke what kind of bow the boy holdeth Which shootes strongly with out any noyse and deadly without smarte. Firr trees great and greene, fixt on a hye hill but a barrein, Lyke to my noble thoughtes, still new, well plac'd, to me fruteles. Figge that yeeldes most pleasante fru'te, his shaddow is hurtefull Thus be her giftes most sweet, thus more danger to be neere her, Now in a palme when I marke, how he doth rise under a burden, And may I not (say I then) gett up though griefs be so weightie? Pine is a maste to a shippe, to my shippe shall hope for a maste serve, Pine is hye, hope is as hie, sharpe leav'd, sharpe yet be my hopes budds. Elme embraste by a vine, embracing fancy reviveth Popler changeth his hew from a rising sunne to a setting: Thus to my sonne do I yeeld, such lookes her beames do aforde me Olde aged oke cutt downe, of newe works serves to the building: So my desires by my feare, cutt downe, be the frames of her honour. Ashe makes speares which shieldes do resist, her force no repulse takes. Palmes do rejoyce to be joynd by the match of a male to a female, And shall sensive things be so sencelesse as to resist sence? Thus be my thoughts disperst, thus thinking nurseth a thinking, Thus both trees and each thing ells, be the bookes of a fancy. But to the Cedar Queene of woods when I lifte my beteard eyes, Then do I shape to my selfe that forme which raign's so with in me, And thinke ther she do dwell &amp; heare what plants I do utter: When that noble toppe doth nodd, I beleeve she salutes me; When by the winde it maketh a noyse, I do thinke she doth answer. Then kneling to the ground, oft thus do I speake to that Image: Onely Juell, O only Juell, which only deservest That mens harts be thy seate and endlesse fame be thy servant, O descende for a while, from this greate height to behold me, But nought els do, behold (else is nought worth the beholding) Save what a worke, by thy selfe is wrought: &amp; since I am altred Thus by thy worke, disdaine not that which is by thy selfe done. In meane caves oft treasure abides, to an hostry a king comes. And so behinde foule clowdes full oft faire starres do ly hidden. Zelmane. Hardy shephearde, such as thy meritts, such may be her insight Justely to graunt thee rewarde, such envie I beare to thy fortune. But to my selfe what wish can I make for a salve to my sorrowes, Whom both nature seemes to debarr from meanes to be helped, And if a meane were found, fortune th'whole course of it hinders. This plag'de how can I frame to my soare any hope of amendemente? Whence may I show to my minde any light of possible escape? Bownd &amp; bownd by so noble bandes, as loth to be unbownd, Jaylor I am to my selfe, prison &amp; prisoner to myne owne selfe. Yet be my hopes thus plast, here fix'd lives all my recomforte, That that deare Dyamond, where wisdome holdeth a sure seate, Whose force had such force so to transforme, nay to reforme me, Will at length perceave these flames by her beames to be kindled, And will pitty the wound festred so strangely within me. O be it so, graunte such an event, O Gods, that event give. And for a sure sacrifice I do dayly oblation offer Of mine owne harte, where thoughts be the temple, sighte is a aultar. But ceasse worthy shepheard, nowe ceasse we to weery the hearers With monefull melodies, for enough our greefes be revealed, If by the parties ment our meanings rightly be marked, And sorrow's do require some respitt unto the sences. [A shepheards tale no height of stile desires] A shepheards tale no height of stile desires To raise in words what in effect is lowe: A plaining songe plaine-singing voice requires, For warbling notes from inward chearing flow. I then, whose burd'ned brest but thus aspires Of shepheards two the seely case to show, Nede not the stately Muses helpe invoke For creeping rimes, which often sighings choke. But you, Ã´ you, that thinke not teares to deare To spend for harms, although they touch you not: And deigne to deeme your neighbors mischefe neare, Although they be of meaner parents gott: You I invite with easie eares to heare The poore-clad truth of loves wrong-ordred lot. Who may be glad, be glad you be not such: Who share in woe, weygh others have as much. Ther was (Ã´ seldome blessed word of was!) A paire of frends, or rather one cal'd two, Train'd in the life which on short-bitten grasse In shine or storme must sett the doubted shoe: He, that the other in some yeares did passe, And in those gifts that years distribute doe, Was Klaius cald, (ah Klaius, wofull wight!) The later borne, yet too soone, Strephon hight. Epeirus high, was honest Klaius nest, To Strephon Ãoles land first breathing lent: But East &amp; West were join'd by frendships hest. As Strephons eare &amp; heart to Klaius bent: So Klaius soule did in his Strephon rest. Still both their flocks flocking togither went, As if they would of owners humour be, And eke their pipes did well, as frends agree. Klaius for skill of hearb's &amp; shepheards art Among the wisest was accounted wise, Yet not so wise, as of unstained harte: Strephon was yonge, yet markt with humble eies How elder rul'd their flocks, &amp; cur'd their smart, So that the grave did not his words despise. Both free of minde, both did clear-dealing love, And both had skill in verse their voice to move. Their chearfull minds, till pois'ned was their cheare, The honest sports of earthy lodging prove; Now for a clod-like hare in fourm they peere, Now bolt &amp; cudgill squirrels leape do move. Now the ambitiouse Larke with mirror cleare They catch, while he (foole!) to himself makes love: And now at keels they trie a harmles chaunce, And now their curr they teach to fetch &amp; daunce. When mery May first early calls the morne, With mery maids a mayeng they do go, Then do they pull from sharpe &amp; niggard thorne The plenteous sweets, (can sweets so sharply grow?) Then some grene gowns are by the lasses worne In chastest plaies, till home they walke a rowe, While daunce about the may-pole is begun, When, if nede were, they could at quintain run: While thus they ran a low, but leaveld race, While thus they liv'd, (this was indede a life) With nature pleas'd, content with present case. Free of proud feares, brave begg'ry, smiling strife Of clime-fall Court, the envy-hatching place: While those restles desires in great men rife To visite so low folkes did much disdaine, This while, though poore, they in themselves did raigne. One day (Ã´ day, that shin'de to make them darke!) While they did ward sun-beames with shady bay, And Klaius taking for his yongling carke, (Lest greedy eies to them might challenge lay) Busy with oker did their shoulders marke, (His marke a Piller was devoid of stay, As bragging that free of all passions mone Well might he others beare, but leane to none) Strephon with leavy twiggs of Laurell tree A garland made on temples for to weare, For he then chosen was the dignitie Of village-Lord that whitsontide to beare: And full, poore foole of boyish bravery With triumphs shews would shew he nought did feare. But fore-accounting oft makes builders misse, They found, they felt, they had no lease of blisse. For ere that either had his purpose done, Behold (beholding well it doth deserve) They saw a maid who thitherward did runne, To catch hir sparrow which from hir did swerve, As she a black-silke cap on him begunne To sett, for foile of his milke-white to serve. She chirping ran, he peeping flew away, Till hard by them both he &amp; she did stay. Well for to see they kept themselves unsene, And saw this fairest maid of fairer minde, By, fortune meare, in Nature borne a Queene, How well apaid she was hir birde to finde: How tenderly hir tender hands betweene In ivory cage she did the micher binde: How rosy moist'ned lipps about his beake Moving, she seem'd at once to kisse, &amp; speake. Chastned but thus, &amp; thus his lesson tought The happy wretch she putt into hir breast, Which to their eies the bowles of Venus brought, For they seem'd made even of skie-mettall best, And that the bias of hir bloud was wrought. Betwixt them two the peeper tooke his nest, Where snugging well he well appear'd content So to have done amisse, so to be shent. This done, but done with captive-killing grace, Each motion seeming shott from beauties bow, With length laid downe she deckt the lonely place. Proud grew the grasse that under hir did growe, The trees spred out their armes to shade hir face, But she on elbow lean'd with sigh's did show No grasse, no trees, nor yet hir sparrow might To long-perplexed minde breed long delight. She troubled was (alas that it mought be!) With tedious brawlings of her parents deare, Who would have hir in will &amp; worde agree To wedd Antaxius their neighbour neare. A heardman rich of much account was he In whome no evill did raigne, nor good appeare. In some such one she lik'd not his desire, Faine would be free, but dreadeth parents ire. Kindly, sweete soule, she did unkindnes take That bagged baggage of a misers mudd, Should price of her, as in a market, make. But golde can guild a rotten piece of wood, To yeeld she found hir noble heart did ake: To strive she fear'd how it with vertue stoode. This doubting clouds ore-casting heav'nly braine, At length in rowes of Kisse-cheeke teares they raine. Cupid the wagg, that lately conquer'd had Wise Counsellors, stout Captaines puissant Kings, And ti'de them fast to leade his triumph badd, Glutted with them now plaies with meanest things. So oft in feasts with costly chaunges cladd To crammed mawes a spratt new Stomake brings. So Lords with sport of Stagg &amp; Hearon full Sometimes we use small birds from nests do pull. So now for pray these shepheards two he tooke Whose mettall stiff he knew he could not bende With hear-say, pictures, or a window looke, With one good dawnce, or letter finely pend, That were in Court a well proportion'd hooke, Where piercing witts do quickly apprehend, Their sences rude plaine objects only move, And so must see great cause before they love. Therfore Love arm'd in hir now takes the fielde, Making hir beames his bravery &amp; might: Hir hands which pierc'd the soules seav'n-double shield, Were now his darts leaving his wonted fight. Brave crest to him hir scorn-gold haire did yeeld, His compleat harneis was hir purest white. But fearing lest all white might seeme too good, In cheeks &amp; lipps the Tyran threatens bloud. Besides this force within hir eies he kept A fire, to burne the prisoners he gaines, Whose boiling heat encreased as she wept: For ev'n in forge colde water fire maintaines. Thus proud &amp; fierce unto the hearts he stept Of them poore soules: &amp; cutting Reasons raines, Made them his owne before they had it wist. But if they had, could shephookes this resist? Klaius streight felt, &amp; groned at the blowe, And cal'd, now wounded, purpose to his aide: Strephon, fond boy, delighted did not knowe, That it was Love that shin'de in shining maid: But lickrous, Poison'd, faine to her would goe, If him new-learned manners had not stai'd. For then Urania homeward did arise, Leaving in paine their wel-fed hungry eies. She went, they staid; or rightly for to say, She staid in them, they went in thought with hyr: Klaius in deede would faine have puld a way This mote from out his eye, this inward burre, And now, proud Rebell gan for to gainsay The lesson which but late he learn'd too furre: Meaning with absence to refresh the thought To which hir presence such a feaver brought. Strephon did leape with joy &amp; jolitie, Thinking it just more therein to delight Then in good Dog, faire field, or shading tree. So have I sene trim bookes in velvet dight With golden leaves, &amp; painted babery Of seely boies please unacquainted sight: But when the rod began to play his part, Faine would, but could not fly from golden smart. He quickly learn'd Urania was her name, And streight for failing, grav'd it in his heart: He knew hir haunt, &amp; haunted in the same, And taught his shepe hir shepe in food to thwart. Which soone as it did batefull question frame, He might on knees confesse his faulty part, And yeeld himselfe unto hir punishment, While nought but game, the selfe-hurt wanton ment. Nay ev'n unto hir home he oft would go, Where bold and hurtles many play he tries, Her parents liking well it should be so, For simple goodnes shined in his eyes. There did he make hir laugh in spite of woe, So as good thoughts of him in all arise, While into none doubt of his love did sinke, For not himselfe to be in love did thinke. But glad Desire, his late embosom'd guest, Yet but a babe, with milke of Sight he nurst: Desire the more he suckt, more sought the brest, Like dropsy folke still drinke to be a thyrst. Till one faire eav'n an howr ere Sun did rest, Who then in Lions cave did enter fyrst, By neighbors prai'd she went abroad therby. At Barly brake hir swete swift foot to trie. Never the earth on his round shoulders bare A maid train'd up from high or low degree, That in her doings better could compare Mirth with respect, few words with curtesy, A careles comelines with comely care, Self-gard with mildnes, Sport with Majesty: Which made hir yeeld to deck this shepheards band, And still, beleve me, Strephon was at hand. A field they goe, where many lookers be, And thou seke-sorow Klaius them among: In dede thou said'st it was thy frend to see Strephon, whose absence seem'd unto thee long, While most with hir he lesse did kepe with thee. No, no, it was in spite of wisdomes song Which absence wisht: love plai'd a victors part: The heav'n-love lodestone drew thy iron hart. Then couples three be streight allotted there, They of both ends the middle two doe flie, The two that in mid place, Hell called were, Must strive with waiting foot, and watching eye To catch of them, and them to hell to beare, That they, as well as they, Hell may supplie: Like some which seeke to salve their blotted name With others blott, till all do tast of shame. There may you see, soone as the middle two Do coupled towards either couple make, They false and fearfull do their hands undoe, Brother his brother, frend doth frend forsake, Heeding himselfe, cares not how fellow doe, But of a straunger mutuall help doth take: As perjur'd cowards in adversity With sight of feare from frends to fremb'd do flie. These sports shepheards deviz'd such faults to show. Geron, though olde yet gamesome, kept one ende With Cosma, for whose love Pas past in woe. Faire Nous with Pas the lott to hell did sende: Pas thought it hell, while he was Cosma fro. At other end Uran did Strephon lend Her happy-making hand, of whome one looke From Nous and Cosma all their beauty tooke. The play began: Pas durst not Cosma chace, But did entend next bout with her to meete, So he with Nous to Geron turn'd their race, With whome to joyne fast ran Urania sweet: But light-legd Pas had gott the middle space. Geron strave hard, but aged were his feet, And therfore finding force now faint to be, He thought gray haires afforded subtletie. And so when Pas hand reached him to take, The fox on knees and elbowes tombled downe: Pas could not stay, but over him did rake, And crown'd the earth with his first touching crowne: His heels grow'n proud did seme at heav'n to shake. But Nous that slipt from Pas, did catch the clowne. So laughing all, yet Pas to ease some dell Geron with Uran were condemn'd to hell. Cosma this while to Strephon safely came, And all to second barly-brake are bent: The two in hell did toward Cosma frame, Who should to Pas, but they would her prevent. Pas mad with fall, and madder with the shame, Most mad with beames which he thought Cosma sent, With such mad haste he did to Cosma goe, That to hir breast he gave a noysome blowe. She quick, and proud, and who did Pas despise, Up with hir fist, and tooke him on the face, Another time, quoth she, become more wise. Thus Pas did kisse hir hand with little grace, And each way luckles, yet in humble guise Did hold hir fast for feare of more disgrace, While Strephon might with preatie Nous have met, But all this while another course he fet. For as Urania after Cosma ran, He ravished with sight how gracefully She mov'd hir lims, and drew the aged man, Left Nous to coast the loved beauty ny. Nous cri'de, and chafd, but he no other can. Till Uran seing Pas to Cosma fly, And Strephon single, turned after him. Strephon so chas'd did seme in milke to swimme. He ran, but ran with eye ore shoulder cast, More marking hir, then how himselfe did goe, Like Numid Lions by the hunters chas'd, Though they do fly, yet backwardly do glowe With proud aspect, disdaining greater hast. What rage in them, that love in him did show. But God gives them instinct the man to shun, And he by law of Barly-brake must run. But as his heate with running did augment, Much more his sight encreast his hote desire: So is in her the best of Nature spent, The aire hir swete race mov'd doth blow the fire. Hir feet be Pursevants from Cupid sent, With whose fine stepps all loves and joyes conspire. The hidden beauties seem'd in waite to lye, To downe proud hearts that would not willing dye. Thus, fast he fled from her he follow'd sore, Still shunning Nous to lengthen pleasing race, Till that he spied old Geron could no more, Then did he slack his love-enstructed pace. So that UrÃ¡n, whose arme old Geron bore, Laid hold on him with most lay-holding grace. So caught, him seem'd he caught of joyes the bell, And thought it heav'n so to be drawn to hell. To hell he goes, and Nous with him must dwell. Nous sware it was no right; for his default Who would be caught, that she should go to hell: But so she must. And now the third assault Of Barly-brake among the six befell. Pas Cosma matcht, yet angry with his fault, The other end Geron with UrÃ¡n garde. I thinke you thinke Strephon bent thitherward. Nous counseld Strephon Geron to pursue, For he was olde, and easly would be cought: But he drew hir as love his fancy drew, And so to take the gemme Urania sought. While Geron olde came safe to Cosma true, Though him to meete at all she sturred nought. For Pas, whither it were for feare, or love, Mov'd not himselfe, nor suffred hir to move. So they three did togither idly stay, While deare UrÃ¡n, whose course was Pas to meet, (He staying thus) was faine abroad to stray With larger round, to shun the folowing feet. Strephon, whose eies on hir back-parts did play, With love drawne on, so fast with pace unmeet Drew dainty Nous, that she not able so To runne, brake from his hands, and let him goe. He single thus, hop'd soone with hir to be, Who nothing earthly, but of fire and aire, Though with soft leggs, did run as fast as he. He thrise reacht, thrise deceiv'd, when hir to beare He hopes, with dainty turns she doth him flee. So on the down's we see, neere Wilton faire, A hast'ned Hare from greedy Grayhound goe, And past all hope his chapps to frustrate so. But this straunge race more straunge conceits did yeeld: Who victor seem'd, was to his ruine brought: Who seem'd orethrown was mistresse of the field: She fled, and tooke: he folow'd, and was cought. So have I heard to pierce pursuing shield By Parents train'd the Tartars wilde are tought, With shafts shott out from their back-turned bow. But, ah! hir darts did farre more depely goe. As Venus bird the white, swift, lovely Dove (O happy Dove that art compar'd to hir!) Doth on hir wings hir utmost swiftnes prove, Finding the gripe of Falcon fierce not furr: So did Uran, the narr the swifter move, (Yet beauty still as fast as she did sturre) Till with long race deare she was breathles brought, And then the PhÅnix feared to be cought. Among the rest that there did take delight To see the sportes of double-shining day, And did the tribute of their wondring sight To Natures heir, the faire Urania, pay, I tolde you Klaius was the haples wight Who earnest found what they accounted play. He did not there doe homage of his eies, But on his eies his heart did sacrifise. With gazing looks, short sighs, unsettled feet, He stood, but turn'd, as Girosol, to Sun: His fancies still did hir in half-way meet, His soule did fly as she was seen to run. In sum proud Boreas never ruled fleet (Who Neptunes webb on daungers distaff spun) With greater powr, then she did make them wend Each way, as she, that ages praise, did bend. Till spieng well she welnigh weary was, And surely taught by his love-open eye, His eye, that ev'n did marke hir troden grasse, That she would faine the catch of Strephon flie, Giving his reason pasport for to passe Whither it would, so it would let him dy, He that before shund hir to shun such harmes, Now runnes, and takes hir in his clipping armes. For with pretence from Strephon hir to garde, He met hir full, but full of warefulnes, With inbow'd bosome well for hir prepar'd, When Strephon cursing his owne backwardnes Came to hir back, and so with double warde Emprison hir, who both them did possesse As heart-bound slaves: and happy then embrace Vertues proofe, fortunes victor, beauties place. Hir race did not hir beauties beames augment, For they were ever in the best degree, But yet a setting foorth it some way lent: As rubies lustre, when they rubbed be. The dainty dew on face and body went As on sweet flowrs when mornings drops we see. Her breath then short seem'd loth from home to pas, Which more it mov'd, the more it sweeter was. Happy, Ã´ happy! if they so might bide, To see hir eies, with how true humblenes They looked down to triumph over pride: With how sweet sawes she blam'd their sawcines: To feele the panting heart, which through hir syde Did beate their hands, which durst so neere to presse. To see, to feele, to heare, to tast, to know More then, besides hir, all the earth could show. But never did Medeas golden weed On Creons child his poison sooner throw, Then those delights through all their sinews breed A creeping serpentlike of mortall woe. Till she brake from their armes (although indeed Going from them, from them she could not go) And fare-welling the flocke did homeward wend, And so that even the barly-brake did end. It ended, but the others woe began, Began at least to be conceiv'd as woe, For then wise Klaius found no absence can Help him, who can no more hir sight foregoe. He found mans vertue is but part of man, And part must folowe where whole man doth goe. He found that Reasons self now reasons found To fasten knotts, which fancy first had bound. So doth he yeeld, so takes he on his yoke, Not knowing who did draw with him therin; Strephon, poore youth, because he saw no smoke Did not conceive what fire he had within. But after this to greater rage it broke, Till of his life it did full conquest win, First killing mirth, then banishing all rest, Filling his eies with teares, with sighs his brest. Then sports grew paines, all talking tediouse, On thoughts he feeds, his lookes their figure chaunge, The day seemes long, but night is odious, No sleeps, but dream's, no dream's, but visions straunge, Till finding still his evill encreasing thus, One day he with his flock abroad did raunge: And comming where he hop'd to be alone, Thus on a hillock set, he made his mone. Alas! what weights are these that lode my heart! I am as dull as winter-sterved sheep, Tir'de as a jade in overloden carte, Yet thoughts do flie, though I can scarcely creep. All visions seeme, at every bush I start: Drowsy am I, and yet can rarely slepe. Sure I bewitched am, it is even that: Late neere a crosse I met an ougly Cat. For, but by charms, how fall these things on me, That from those eies where heav'nly apples bene, Those eies, which nothing like themselves can see, Of faire Urania, fairer then a greene, Proudly bedeckt in Aprills livory, A shot unheard gave me a wound unseene? He was invisible that hurt me so, And none unvisible, but Spirites, can goe. When I see her, my sinewes shake for feare, And yet, deare soule, I know she hurteth none: Amid my flock with woe my voice I teare, And, but bewitch'd, who to his flock would mone? Her chery lipps, milke hands, and golden haire I still do see, though I be still alone. Now make me thinke that there is not a fende, Who hid in Angels shape my life would ende. The sportes wherin I wonted to do well, Come she, and sweet the aire with open brest, Then so I faile, when most I would do well, That at me so amaz'd my fellowes jest: Sometimes to her newes of my selfe to tell I go about, but then is all my best Wry words, and stam'ring, or els doltish dombe, Say then, can this but of enchantment come? Nay each thing is bewitcht to know my case: The Nightingales for woe their songs refraine: In river as I look'd my pining face, As pin'd a face as mine I saw againe. The courteous mountaines griev'd at my disgrace Their snowy haire teare of in melting paine. And now the dropping trees do wepe for me, And now faire evenings blush my shame to see. But you my pipe, whilome my chief delight, Till straunge delight, delight to nothing ware; And you my flock, care of my carefull sight, While I was I, &amp; so had cause to care; And thou my dogg, whose truth &amp; valiant might Made wolves (not inward wolves) my ewes to spare; Go you not from your master in his woe: Let it suffise that he himselfe forgoe. For though like waxe, this magique makes me waste, Or like a lambe whose dam away is fet, (Stolne from her yoong by theeves unchoosing hast) He treble beas for helpe, but none can get: Though thus, and worse, though now I am at last, Of all the games that here ere now I met: Do you remember still you once were mine, Till my eies had their curse from blessed eine. Be you with me while I unheard do cry, While I do score my losses on the winde, While I in heart my will write ere I die. In which by will, my will and wits I binde: Still to be hers, about her aye to flie, As this same sprite about my fancies blinde, Doth daily haunt: but so, that mine become As much more loving, as lesse combersome. Alas! a cloud hath overcast mine eies: And yet I see her shine amid the cloud. Alas! of ghostes I heare the gastly cries: Yet there, me seemes, I heare her singing loud. This song she singes in most commaunding wise: Come shepheards boy, let now thy heart be bowd To make it selfe to my least looke a slave: Leave sheepe, leave all, I will no piecing have. I will, I will, alas! alas! I will: Wilt thou have more? more have, if more I be. Away ragg'd rams, care I what murraine kill? Out shreaking pipe made of some witched tree. Go bawling curre, thy hungry maw go fill, On yond foule flocke belonging not to me. With that his dogge he henst his flocke he curst: With that (yet kissed first) his pipe he burst. This said, this done, he rase even tir'd with rest, With heart as carefull, as with carelesse grace, With shrinking legges, but with a swelling brest, With eyes which threatned they would drowne his face, Fearing the worst, not knowing what were best, And giving to his sight a wandring race, He saw behind a bush where Klaius sate: His well know'ne friend, but yet his unknowne mate, Klaius the wretch, who lately yelden was To beare the bondes which Time nor wit could breake, (With blushing soule at sight of judgements glasse, While guilty thoughts accus'd his Reason weake) This morne alone to lonely walke did passe, Within himselfe of hir deare selfe to speake, Till Strephons planing voice him nearer drew, Where by his words his self-like cause he knew. For hearing him so oft with wordes of woe Urania name, whose force he knew so well, He quickly knew what witchcraft gave the blow Which made his Strephon think himselfe in hell. Which when he did in perfect image show, To his owne witt, thought upon thought did swell, Breeding huge stormes within his inward parte, Which thus breath'd out with earthquake of his hart. The Second Eclogues. [Up, up Philisides, let sorrowes goe] Geron. Philisides. Geron. Up, up Philisides, let sorrowes goe, Who yelds to woe, doth but encrease his smart. Do not thy hart, to plaintfull custome bring, But let us sing, sweet tunes do passions ease, An olde man heare, who would thy fancies raise. Philisides. Who minds to please the minde drownd in annoyes With outward joyes, which inly cannot sincke, As well may thincke with oyle to coole the fire: Or with desire to make such foe a frend, Who doth his soule to endlesse malice bend. Geron. Yet sure an end, to each thing time doth give, Though woes now live, at length thy woes must dye. Then vertue try, if she can worke in thee That which we see in many time hath wrought, And weakest harts to constant temper brought. Philisides. Who ever taught a skillesse man to teach, Or stop a breach, that never Cannon sawe? Sweet vertues lawe barres not a causefull mone. Time shall in one my life and sorrowes end, And me perchaunce your constant temper lend. Geron. What can amend where physick is refusde? The witts abusde with will no counsayle take. Yet for my sake discover us thy griefe. Oft comes reliefe when most we seeme in trappe. The starres thy state, fortune may change thy happe. Philisides. If fortunes lappe became my dwelling place, And all the starres conspired to my good, Still were I one, this still should be my case, Ruines relique, cares web, and sorrowes foode: Since she faire fierce to such a state me calls, Whose wit the starres, whose fortune fortune thralls. Geron. Alas what falls are falne unto thy minde? That there where thou confest thy mischiefe lyes Thy wit dost use still still more harmes to finde. Whome wit makes vaine, or blinded with his eyes, What counsell can prevaile, or light give light? Since all his force against himselfe he tries. Then each conceit that enters in his sight, Is made, forsooth, a Jurate of his woes, Earth, sea, ayre, fire, heav'n, hell, and gastly sprite. Then cries to sencelesse things, which neither knowes What ayleth thee, and if they knew thy minde Would scorne in man (their king) such feeble show's. Rebell, Rebell, in golden fetters binde This tyran Love; or rather do suppresse Those rebell thoughts which are thy slaves by kinde. Let not a glittring name thy fancie dresse In painted clothes, because they call it love. There is no hate that can thee more oppresse. Begin (and halfe the worke is done) to prove By rising up, upon thy selfe to stand. And thinck she is a she, that doth thee move. He water plowes, and soweth in the sand, And hopes the flickring winde with net to holde Who hath his hopes laid up in womans hand. What man is he that hath his freedome solde? Is he a manlike man, that doth not know man Hath power that Sex with bridle to withhold? A fickle Sex, and trew in trust to no man, A servant Sex, soone prowde if they be coi'de And to conclude thy mistresse is a woman. Philisides. O gods, how long this old foole hath annoi'd My wearied eares! O gods yet graunt me this, That soone the world of his false tong be void. O noble age who place their only blisse In being heard untill the hearer dye Uttring a serpents minde with serpents hisse. Then who will heare a well autoris'd lye, (And pacience hath) let him goe learne of him What swarmes of vertues did in his youth flye Such hartes of brasse, wise heads, and garments trim Were in his dayes: which heard, one nothing heares, If from his words the falshood he do skim. And herein most their folly vaine appeares That since they still alledge, When they were yong: It shews they fetch their wit from youthfull yeares Like beast for sacrifice, where save the tong And belly nought is left, such sure is he, This life-deadman in this old dungeon flong. Olde houses are throwne downe for new we see: The oldest Rammes are culled from the flocke: No man doth wish his horse should aged bee. The ancient oke well makes a fired blocke: Old men themselves, doe love young wives to choose: Only fond youth admires a rotten stocke. Who once a white long beard, well handle does, (As his beard him, not he his beard did beare) Though cradle witted, must not honnor loose. Oh when will men leave off to judge by haire, And thinke them olde, that have the oldest minde, With vertue fraught and full of holy feare! Geron. If that thy face were hid, or I were blinde, I yet should know a young man speaketh now, Such wandring reasons in thy speech I finde. He is a beast, that beastes use will allowe For proofe of man, who sprong of heav'nly fire Hath strongest soule, when most his raynes do bowe. But fondlings fonde, know not your owne desire Loth to dye young, and then you must be olde, Fondly blame that to which your selves aspire. But this light choller that doth make you bolde, Rather to wrong then unto just defence, Is past with me, my bloud is waxen colde. Thy words, though full of malapert offence, I way them not, but still will thee advize How thou from foolish love maist purge thy sense. First thinke they erre, that thinke them gayly wise, Who well can set a passion out to show: Such sight have they that see with goggling eyes. Passion beares high when puffing with doth blowe, But is indeed a toy, if not a toy, True cause of evils, and cause of causelesse woe. If once thou maist that fancie glosse destroy Within thy selfe, thou soone wilt be ashamed To be a player of thine owne annoy. Then let thy minde with better bookes be tamed, Seeke to espie her faultes as well as praise, And let thine eyes to other sports be framed. In hunting fearefull beastes, do spend some dayes, Or catch the birds with pitfalls, or with lyme, Or trayne the fox that traines so crafty laies. Ly but to sleepe, and in the earely prime Seeke skill of hearbes in hills, haunt brookes neere night, And try with bayt how fish will bite sometime. Goe graft againe, and seeke to graft them right, Those pleasant plants, those sweete and frutefull trees, Which both the pallate, and the eyes delight. Cherish the hives of wisely painfull Bees: Let speciall care upon thy flock be staid, Such active minde but seldome passion sees. Philisides. Hath any man heard what this old man said? Truly not I, who did my thoughts engage, Where all my paines one looke of her hath paid. [Downe, downe Melampus; what? your fellow bite?] Geron. Mastix. Geron. Downe, downe Melampus; what? your fellow bite? I set you ore the flock I dearly love, Them to defend, not with your selves to fight. Do you not thincke this will the wolves remove From former feare, they had of your good mindes, When they shall such devided weakenesse prove? What if LÃ¦laps a better morsell finde? Then you earst knew? rather take part with him Then jarle: lo, lo, even these how envie blindes. And then LÃ¦laps let not pride make thee brim Because thou hast thy fellow overgone, But thanke the cause, thou seest, where he is dim. Here LÃ¦laps, here, in deed against the foen Of my good sheepe, thou never trew's time tooke: Be as thou art, but be with mine at one. For though Melampus like a wolfe doo looke, (For age doth make him of a wolvish hew) Yet have I seene when well a wolfe he shooke. Foole that I am that with my dogges speake grewe. Come neere good Mastix, tis now full tway score Of yeeres (alas) since I good Mastix knewe. Thou heardst even now a yong man snebb me sore, Because I red him, as I would my son. Youth will have will: Age must to age therefore. Mastix. What marvaile if in youth such faults be done, Since that we see our saddest Shepheards out Who have their lesson so long time begonne? Quickly secure, and easilie in doubt, Either a sleepe be all if nought assaile, Or all abroade if but a Cubb start out. We shepeheards are like them that under saile Doe speake high wordes, when all the coaste is cleare, Yet to a passenger will bonnet vaile. I con thee thanke to whom thy dogges be deare, But commonly like currs we them entreate, Save when great need of them perforce apeare. Then him we kisse, whom late before we beatt With such intemperance, that each way grows Hate of the firste, contempt of later feate: And such discord twixt greatest shepheards flowes, That sport it is to see with howe greate art By justice worke they their owne faultes disclose: Like busie boyes, to winne their tutors harte, One saith, He mockes; the other saith, he playes; The third his lesson mist, till all do smarte. As for the rest, howe shepeheardes spend their daies, At blowe point, hotcocles, or els at keeles While, Let us passe our time each shepeheard saies. So small accompt of time the shepeheard feeles And doth not feele, that life is nought but time And when that time is paste, death holdes his heeles. To age thus doe they draw there youthfull pryme, Knowing no more, then what poore tryall showes, As fishe sure tryall hath of muddy slyme. This paterne good, unto our children goes, For what they see, their parents love or hate Their first caught sence prefers to teachers blowes. These cocklinges cockred we bewaile to late, When that we see our ofspring gaily bent, Wemen man-wood, &amp; men effeminate. Geron. Fy man, fy man, what wordes hath thy tonge lent? Yet thou art mickle warse then ere was I, Thy too much zeale, I feare thy braine hath spent. We oft are angrier, with the feeble flie For busines, where it pertaines him not, Then with the poisno'us todes that quiet lie. I pray thee what hath ere the Parret gott, And yet they say he talkes in greate mens bowers? A Cage (guilded perchaunce) is all his lott. Who of his tongue the lickowr gladly powrs, A good foole call'd with paine, perhapps may be, But even for that shall suffer mightie Lowers. Let swannes example siker serve for thee, Who once all birdes, in sweetly-singing past, But now to silence turn'd his minstralsie. For he woulde sing, but others were defaste; The peacockes pride, the pyes pild stattery, Cormoraunts glutt, Kites spoile, king fishers waste. The Falcons fercenes, Sparrows letchery The Cockows shame, the Gooses good intent, Even turtle toutcht he with hypocrisie. And worse of other more, till by assent Of all the birdes, but namely those were grieved, Of fowles there called was a parliament. There was the swan of dignitie deprived, And statute made he never shoulde have voice, Since when I thinke he hath in silence lived. I warne thee therefore (since thou maist have choice) Let not thy tonge become a firy matche, No sword soe bytes as that evill toole annoyes. Lett our unpartiall eyes a litle watche Our owne demeane, and soone we wondre shall That huntinge faultes, our selves we did not catch. Into our mindes let us a little fall, And we shall find more spottes then Leopards skinne. Then who makes us such judges over all? But farewell nowe, thy fault is no great sinne, Come, come my currs, tis late I will goe in. [My muse what ail's this ardour] My muse what ail's this ardour To blase my onely secretts? Alas it is no glory To sing my owne decaid state. Alas it is no comfort, To speake without an answere. Alas it is no wisdome To shew the wound without cure, My muse what ail's this ardour? Mine eys be dym, my lyms shake, My voice is hoarse, my throte scerchte, My tong to this my roofe cleaves, My fancy amazde, my thought dull'd, My harte doth ake, my life faints, My sowle beginnes to take leave. So greate a passion all feele, To think a soare so deadly I should so rashly ripp up. My muse what ail's this ardour? If that to sing thou arte bent Go sing the fall of old, Thebes The warres of ougly Centaurs, The life, the death of Hector So may the songe be famous, Or if to love thou art bent, Recount the rape of Europe, Adonis end, Venus nett The sleepy kisse the moone stale: So may thy song be pleasant. My muse what ail's this ardour To blase my onely secretts? Wherein do only flowrish The sorry fruites of anguish. The song thereof a last will, The tunes be cryes, the words plaints, The singer is the songs theame When no eare can have joy, Nor ey receave due object Ne pleasure here, ne fame gett. My muse what ail's this ardour? Alas she saith I am thine, So are thy pains my pains too. Thy heated harte my seat is Wherein I burne thy breath is My voice, too hott to keepe in, Besides lo here the auther Of all thy harmes: Lo here she, That only can redresse thee, Of her I will demaund helpe. My muse I yeeld, my muse singe, But all thy songe herein knitt, The life we leade is all love: The love we holde is all death, Nor ought I crave to feede life, Nor ought I seeke to shun death, But onely that my goddesse My life my death do counte hers. [Reason, tell me thy mind, if here be reason] Reason, tell me thy mind, if here be reason In this strange violence, to make resistance. Where sweet graces erect the stately banner Of vertues regiment, shining in harnesse Of fortunes Diademes, by beauty mustred. Say then Reason, I say what is thy counsell? Her loose haire be the shott, the breaste the pykes be, Skowts each motion is, the hands be horsmen, Her lipps are the riches the warres to maintaine, Where well couched abides a coffer of pearle, Her legges carriage is of all the sweet campe: Say then Reason I say what is thy counsell? Her cannons be her eys, myne eys the walls be, Which at firste voly gave too open entry, Nor ramper did abide; my braine was up blowne, Undermin'd with a speech the pearcer of thoughts. Thus weakned by my selfe, no helpe remaineth Say then Reason; I say, what is thy counsell? And now fame the herald of her true honour, Doth proclaime with a sound made all by mens mouths That nature soverayne of earthly dwellers, Commands all creatures, to yeeld obeysance Under this, this her owne, her only dearling. Say then Reason I say what is thy counsell? Reason sighes but in end he thus doth answere. Nought can reason availe in heav'nly matters. Thus natures Diamond receaves thy conquest, Thus pure pearle, I do yeeld, my senses and soule. Thus sweete paine, I do yeeld, what ere I can yeelde, Reason looke to thy selfe, I serve a goddesse. [O sweet woods the delight of solitarines!] O sweet woods the delight of solitarines! O how much I do like your solitarines! Where mans mind hath a freed consideration Of goodnes to receive lovely direction. Where senses do behold th'order of heav'nly hoste, And wise thoughts do behold what the creator is: Contemplation here holdeth his only seate: Bownded with no limitts, borne with a wing of hope Clymes even unto the starres, Nature is under it. Nought disturbs thy quiet, all to thy service yeelds Each sight draws on a thought, thought mother of science, Sweet birds kindly do graunt harmony unto thee, Faire trees shade is enough fortification, Nor danger to thy selfe if be not in thy selfe. O sweete woods the delight of solitarines! O how much I do like your solitarines! Here nor treason is hidd, vailed in innocence, Nor envies snaky ey, finds any harbor here, Nor flatterers venomous insinuations, Nor comming humorists puddled opinions, Nor courteous ruin of proffered usury, Nor time pratled away, cradle of ignorance, Nor causelesse duty, nor comber of arrogance, Nor trifling title of vanity dazleth us, Nor golden manacles, stand for a paradise, Here wrongs name is unheard: slander a monster is Keepe thy sprite from abuse, here no abuse doth haunte. What man grafts in a tree dissimulation? O sweete woods the delight of solitarines! O how well I do like your solitarines! Yet deare soile, if a soule closed in a mansion As sweete as violetts, faire as lilly is, Streight as Cedar, a voice staines the Cannary birds, Whose shade safely doth hold, danger avoideth her: Such wisedome, that in her lives speculation: Such goodnes that in her simplicitie triumphs: Where envies snaky ey, winketh or els dyeth, Slander wants a pretext, flattery gone beyond: Oh! if such a one have bent, to a lonely life, Her stepps gladd we receave, gladd we receave her eys. And thinke not she doth hurt our solitarines, For such company decks such solitarines.

S. His Astrophel and Stella. Wherein the excellence of sweete Poesie is concluded To the end of which are added, sundry other rare Sonnets of diuers Noble men and Gentlemen. SIR P. S. HIS ASTROPHEL AND STELLA. I Loving in trueth, and fayne my love in verse to show, That the deere Shee, might take some pleasure of my paine: Pleasure might cause her reade, reading might make her know, Knowledge might pittie winne, and pittie grace obtaine. I sought fit wordes, to paint the blackest face of woe, Studying inventions fine, her wittes to entertaine, Oft turning others leaves, to see if thence would flowe, Some fresh and fruitfull showre, upon my Sunne-burnt braine. But wordes came halting out, wanting inventions stay, Invention Natures childe, fledde Stepdames studies blowes: And others feete, still seem'de but straungers in my way, Thus great with Childe to speake, and helplesse in my throwes, Byting my tongue and penne, beating my selfe for spite: Foole saide My muse to mee, looke in thy heart and write. II Not at first sight, nor with a dribbing shot, Love gave the wound, which while I breath will bleede: But knowne, worth did in tract of time proceede, Till by degrees it had full conquest got. I sawe and lik'd, I lik'd but loved not, I lov'd, but did not straight what Love decreede: At length to Loves decrees, I first agreede. Yet with repining at so partiall lot. Now even that foot-steppe of lost libertie Is gone, and now like slave borne Muscovite: I call it praise to suffer tyrannie, And nowe imploy the remnant of my wit To make my selfe beleeve that all is well, While with a feling skill I paint my hell. III Let Dainty wittes cry, on the Sisters nine, That bravely maskt, their fancies may be tolde: Or Pinders Apes flaunt in their phrases fine, Enameling their pride with flowers of golde. Or els let them in stately glorie shine, Ennobling new founde tropes, with problemes old: Or with straunge similes, inricht each line, Of hearbes or beastes, which Inde or Affricke hold. For me in sooth, no Muse but one I know, Phrases and Problemes from my reach doe growe, And straunge things cost too deere for my poore sprites, How then? even thus, in Stellas face I reede, What love and beauty be, then all my deede. But coppying is, what in her nature writes. IV Vertue (alas) now let me take some rest, Thou set'st a bate betweene my love and me: If vaine love have my simple soule opprest, Leave what thou lik'st, and deale thou not with it. Thy Scepter use in some olde Catoes brest, Churches and Schooles are for thy seat most fit: I doe confes, (pardon a fault confest,) My mouth too tender is for thy hard bit. But if that needes, thou wilt usurping bee That little reason that is left in mee. And still the effect of thy perswasions proove, I sweare, my heart such one shall shew to thee, That shrines in flesh so true a deitie. That Vertue, thou thy selfe shalt be in love. V It is most true, what wee call Cupids dart An Image is, which for our selves we carve: And fooles adore, in Temple of our hart, Till that good God make church and Church-men starve. It is most true, that eyes are bound to serve The inward part: and that the heavenly part Ought to be King, from whose rules who doth swerve, Rebels to nature, strive for their owne smart. True that true beautie vertue is indeede, Whereof this beautie can but be a shade: Which Elements with mortall mixture breede, True that on earth we are but Pilgrimes made. And should in soule, up to our Country move: True and most true, that I must Stella love. VI Some Lovers speake, when they their Muses entertaine Of hopes begott, by feare, of wot not what desires, Of force of heavenly beames, infusing hellish paine; Of lyving deathes deere woundes, faire storms and flashing fyres. Some one his songes in Jove and Joves straunge tales attyres, Bordered with Bulles and Swannes, poudered with golden raine: An other humbler witte to shepheards pipe retyres, Yet hiding royall blood, full oft in Rurall vaine. To some a sweetest plaint a sweetest stile affordes, Whiles teares poure out his inke, and sighes breath out his wordes. His paper pale despaire, and paine his penne doth move. I can speake what I feele, and feele as much as they, But thinke that all the mappe of my state, I display. When trembling voice bringes forth, that I do Stella love. VII When nature made her chiefe worke, Stellas eyes, In collour blacke, why wrapt she beames so bright? Would she in beamy blacke like Painter wise, Frame daintiest lustre mixte with shaddowes light? Or did she els that sober hewe devise, In object best, to strength and knitt our sight: Least if no vaile these brave beames did disguise, They Sun-like would more dazell than delight. Or would she her miraculous power shewe, That whereas blacke seemes Beauties contrarie, Shee even in blacke doth make all Beauties flowe: But so and thus, she minding Love should bee Plaste ever there, gave him this mourning weede: To honour all their deathes, who for her bleede. VIII Love borne in Greece, of late fled from his native place, Forst by a tedious proofe, that Turkish hardned harts Were no fit markes, to pearce with his fine pointed darts: And pleasd with our soft peace, staide here his fleeting race. But finding these colde climes, too coldlie him imbrace, Not usde to frosen lippes, he strave to finde some part Where with most ease and warmth, he might imploy his art. At length himselfe he pearch'd in Stellas face, Whose faire skinne, beamie eyes, like morning Sunne in snowe: Deceiv'd the quaking boy, who thought from so pure light, Effects of livelie heate in nature needes must growe. But she most faire, most colde; made him there take his flight To my close hart; where while some fire brands he did lay, He burnt unwares his winges, and cannot fly away. IX Queene Vertues Court, which some call Stellas face, Prepar'd by Natures cheefest furniture: Hath his front built of Alablaster pure, Golde is the covering of that statelie place. The doore, by which sometimes runnes forth her grace Red Porphire is, which locke of Pearle makes sure: Whose Porches rich, with name of chekes indure, Marble mixt red and white, doe enterlace. The Windowes now, through which this heavenly guest Lookes on the world, and can finde nothing such, Which dare claime from those sightes the name of best, Of touch they are, that without touch doe touch, Which Cupids selfe, from Beauties mine did drawe: Of touch they are, and poore I am their strawe. X Reason, in faith thou art well serv'd, that still Would'st brabling be, with sence and love in me: I rather wish thee climbe the Muses hill, Or reach the fruite of Natures chiefest tree; Or seeke heavens course, or heavens unusde to thee: Why should'st thou toyle, our thornie grounde to till? Leave sence and those that sences objectes be, Deale thou with powers, of thoughts leave thou to will. But thou wouldst needes fight both with Love and sence, With sworde of witte, giving woundes of dispraise: Till downe right blowes did foyle thy cunning fence, So soone as they strake thee with Stellas rayes. Reason, thou knewst, and offered straight to prove By reason good, good reason her to love. XI In truth oh Love: with what a boyish kinde Thou doost proceede, in thy most serious waies; That when thy heaven to thee his best displaies, Yet of that best thou leav'st the best behinde. That like a Childe that some faire booke doth finde With gilden leaves of colloured Velom, playes; Or at the most on some faire picture staies, But never heedes the fruite of Writers minde. So when thou sawest in Natures cabinet, Stella, thou straight lokest babies in her eyes: In her chekes pit, thou didst thy pitfall set, And in her brest to peepe, a lowting lyes. Playing and shining in each outward part: But foole seekst not to get into her hart. XII Cupid because thou shin'st in Stellas eyes, That from her lookes thy dimnesse nowe scapes free: That those lips swelde so full of thee they be. That sweet breath maketh oft the flames to rise, That in her brest thy pap well sugred lyes, That grace even makes thy gracious wrongs; that she, What word so ere shee speakes, perswades for thee: That her cleere voice, lifteth the Sunne to Skyes. Thou countest Stella thine, like those whose powres Having got up a breach, (by fighting well) Cry victory, this happy day is ours: Oh no, her heart is such a Cytadell. So fortified with wit, stor'd with disdaine: That to winne it, is all the skill and paine. XIII Phoebus was Judge, twixt Jove and Mars in love, Of those three Gods whose armes the fairest weare: Joves golden shielde, did Eagle Sables beare. Whose talents holde young Ganimede above. But in verde fieldes, Mars beares a golden Speare, Which through a bleeding heart, his point did shove: Each had his Crest, Mars carried Venus glove. Jove on his Helme the Thunder bolte did reare. Cupid then smiles, for on his crest there lyes Stellas fayre haire, her face he makes his shielde: Where Roses gules, are borne in silver fielde. Phoebus drewe wide the Curtaine of the skyes To blase the last, and swore devoutly then: The first thus macht, were scarcely Gentlemen. XIV Alas, have I not paine enough my friend, Uppon whose breast, a fiercer gripe doth tyre, Than did on him, who first stole downe the fyre; While Love on me, doth all his quiver spend, But with your rubarbe wordes you must contend, To greeve me worse in saying, that desier Doth plunge my well form'd soule, even in the mier Of sinfull thoughtes, which doe in ruine end. If that be sinne which doth the manners frame, Well stayed with trueth, in worde and faith of deede, Readie of wit, and fearing nought but shame; If it be sin which in fixt hart dooth breede, A loathing of all loost true chastitie; Then love is sin, and let me sinfull bee. XV You that doe search for every purling spring, Which from the rybs of old Pernassus flowes, And every flower (not sweete perhaps) which growes Neere there about, into your Poems wring. You that doe dictionary method bring Into your rymes, running in ratling rowes, You that old Petrarchs long deceased woes With new borne sighes, and wit disguised sing; You take wrong wayes, those far-fet helps be such, As doe bewray a want of inward tutch, And sure at length stolne goods doe come to light. But if both for your love and skill you name, You seeke to nurse at fullest brest of Fame, Stella behold and then begin to write. XVI In nature apt to like, when I did see Beauties which were of many Carrects fine, My boyling spirits did thether then incline, And Love I thought that I was full of thee; But finding not those restles flames in me Which others said did make theyr soules to pyne, I thought those babes of some pins hurt did whine: By my love judging what loves pains might be. But while I thus with this young Lyon plaid, Myne eyes (shall I say curst or blest) beheld Stella: now she is nam'de, neede more be sayd? In her sight I a lesson new have speld. I now have learnd love right, and learnd even so, As they that beeing poysoned, poyson know. XVII His mother deere Cupid offended late, Because that Mars grew slacker in her love, With pricking shot he did not throughly move To keepe the place of their first loving state: The boy refusde, for feare of Marses hate; Who thretned stripes, if he his wrath did prove: But she, in chafe him from her lappe did shove, Broke bowe, broke shaftes, where Cupid weeping sate, Till that his Grandam Nature pittying it, Of Stellas browes, made him two better bowes: And in her eyes of arrowes infinit. O how for joye he leapes, Ã´ how he crowes; And straight therewith, like wagges new got to play: Falls to shrewde turnes, and I was in his way. XVIII With what strange checkes I in my selfe am shent, When into Reasons Audit I doe goe: And by such counts my selfe a Banckerowt know Of all those goods which heaven to me hath lent, Unable quite, to pay even Natures rent, Which unto it by birth-right I doe owe: And which is worse, no good excuse can showe, But that my wealth I have most idly spent, My wit doth waste, my knowledge bringes forth toyes, My wit doth strive, those passions to defende With my rewarde, the spoile of vaine annoyes; I see my course, to loose my selfe doth bende. I see and yet no greater sorrowe take Than that I loose no more for Stellas sake. XIX On Cupids bowe, how are my hart strings bent? That see my wracke, and yet imbrace the same: When most I glory, then I feele most shame; I willing run, yet when I runne repent; My best wittes still their owne disgrace invent, My verie yncke, turnes straight to Stellas name: And yet my wordes (as them my penne doth frame) [Against themselves that they are vainely spent.] For though she passe all things, yet what is all That unto me, that fare like him that both Lookes to the skyes and in a ditch doth fall, O let me prove my mind yet in his grouth And not in nature, for best fruites unfit; Scholler saith Love bend hitherward thy wit. XX Flye, flye my friendes, I have my deathes wound, flye; See there that boy, that murthering boy I say, Who like a thiefe hid in a bush doth lye, Tyll blooddy bullet get him wrongfull pray. So, tyrant he no fitter place could spy, Nor so farre levell in so secrete stay: As that sweete blacke which walles thy heavenly eye, There he himselfe with his shot close doth laye. Poore passenger, passe now thereby I did, And staid to see the prospect of the place, While that black hue from me the bad guest hid, But straight I saw motions of lightnings grace, And there discried the glisterings of his dart: But ere I could flie thence, it pearst my hart. XXI Your words my freends me causelesly doe blame, My young minde marde wh? Love doth menace so: That my owne writings like bad servants shew My wits, quick in vaine thoughts, in vertue lame; That Plato I have reade for nought, but if he tame Such coltish yeeres; that to my birth I owe Nobler desires: least els that to my foe Great expectation were a trayne of shame. For since mad Mars great promise made to me, If now the May of my yeeres much decline, What can be hop'd my harvest time will be, Well said, your wit in vertues golden myne Digs deepe with learnings spade: now tell me this, Hath this world ought so faire as Stella is? XXII In highest way of heaven the Sunne did ride, Progressing from fayre Twynns in golden place, Having no maske of Clowdes before his face, But streaming forth his heate in chiefest pride, When some faire Ladies by hard promise tyde, On horsebacke met him in his furious race, Yet each prepar'de with Fannes well shading grace, From that foes wounds their tender skinnes to hide. Stella alone, with face unarmed marcht, Either to doe like him, as carelesse showne: Or carelesse of the welth, because her owne. Yet were their hid and meaner beauties parcht, Her daintiest bare went free; the cause was this, The Sunne that others burnt, did her but kisse. XXIII The curious wits, seeing dull pensivenes Bewray it selfe in my long setled eyes: When these same fumes and mellancholie rise, With idle paines and missing paines doth gesse; Some that know how, my spring I did addresse, Deeme that my Muse some fruite of knowledge plyes: Others, because the Prince my service tryes, Thinke that I think, State errors to redresse; But harder Judges, judge ambitious rage, (Scourge of it selfe, till clyming slippery place) Holds my young braine captiv'd in golden cage. O fooles, farre otherwise alas the case; For all my thoughts have neither stop nor start, But onely Stellas eyes, and Stellas hart. XXIV Rich fooles there be, whose base and filthy hart, Lyes hatching still the goods wherein they flow: Damning themselves to Tantalus his smart, Welth breeding want, more rich, more wretched grow. Yet to those fooles, heaven doth such wit impart, As what their hands doe hold, their heads doe know. And knowing love, and loving lay apart, As scattered things, farre from all dangers show. But that rich foole, whom by blinde Fortunes lot, The richest gem of love and life enjoyes, And can with foule abuse such beauties blot: Let him deprived of sweet, but unfelt joyes Exilde for aye, from those high treasures which He knowes not grow, in onely follie rich. XXV The wisest scholler of the wight most wise, By Phoebus doome, with sugred sentence sayes: That vertue if it once meete with our eyes, Strange flames of love it in our soules would rayse. But for that man with paine this truth discries, While he each thing in sences ballance wayes, And so, nor will nor can behold those skyes, Which inward Summe to heroicke mindes displaies. Vertue of late with vertuous care to stir Love of himselfe, take Stellas shape, that hee To mortal eyes might sweetly shine in her. It is most true, for since I did her see, Vertues great beautie in her face I prove, And finde defect; for I doe burne in love. XXVI Though duskie wits doe scorne Astrologie, And fooles can thinke those lampes of purest light, Whose number waies greatnes eternitie. Promising wondrous wonders to invite, To have for no cause birth-right in the skyes. But for to spangle the blacke weedes of Night, Or for some braue within that Chamber hie, They shold still daunce to please a gazers sight. For me I nature every deale doe know, And know great causes, great effects procure, And know those bodies high, raigne on the low. And if these rules did fall, proofe makes me sure, Who oft bewraies my after following case, By onely those two starres in Stellas face. XXVII Because I oft in darke abstracted guise, Seeme most alone in greatest company, With dearth of words, and aunswers quite awry, To them that would make naked speech arise; They deeme, and of their doome the rumor flies, That poyson foule of bubling pride doth lie So in my swelling brest, that onely I Faune on my selfe, all others doe dispise: Yet pride (I thinke) doth not my soule possesse, (Which lookes too oft in this unflattering glasse) But one worse fault, ambition I confesse, That makes me oft my best freendes over-passe, Unseene unheard, while thought to highest place Bends all his powers, even unto Stellas grace. XXVIII You that with allegories curious frame Of others children changlings use to make, With me those paines for God-sake doe not take, I list not dig so deepe for brasen fame. When I say Stella, I doe meane the same Princesse of beautie, for whose onely sake, The raynes of love I love, though never slake; And joy therin, though Nations count it shame: I begge no subject to use eloquence, Nor hidden waies to guide Philosophie, Looke at my hands for no such quintessence, But know that I in pure simplicitie, Breathe out the flames which burne within my hart, Love onely leading me into this arte. XXIX Like some weake Lords neighbours by mighty kings, To keepe themselves and their chiefe Citties free Doe easily yeelde, that all theyr coast may be Readie to serve their Campe of needfull things: So Stellas hart finding what power Love brings, To keepe it selfe in life and libertie, Doth willing graunt that in the Frontire he Use all to helpe his other conquerings. And thus her hart escapes, but thus her eyes Serve him with shot, her lips his Herralds are, Her brests his Tents, legges his tryumphall Chare, Herselfe his foode, her skin his Armor brave. But for because my chiefest prospect lyes Upon the coast, I am given up for a slave. XXX Whether the Turkish new Moone minded be, To fill her hornes uppon the Christian coast, How Polands king mindes without leave of hoast, To warme with ill made fire cold Muscovie, If French can yet three parts in one agree, What now the Dutch in their full diets boast, How Holland harts, now so good Townes are lost [Trust in the shade of pleasing Orange tree. How Ulster likes of the same goldenbitt,] Wherewith my Father made it once halfe tame, If in the Scottish Court be weltering yet; These questions busie wits to me do frame: I combered with good manners, aunswere doe, But know not how, for still I thinke on you. XXXI With how sad steps Ã´ Moone thou clim'st the skyes, How silently, and with how wan a face, What may it be, that even in heavenly place, That busie Archer his sharpe Arrowes tryes? Sure if that long with love acquainted eyes Can judge of love, thou feelst of Lovers case, I reade within thy lookes thy languisht grace. To mee that feele the like, my state discries. Then even of fellowship Ã´ Moone tell me, Is constant love deemde there but want of wit? Are beauties there, as proude as heere there be? Doe they above, love to be lov'd, and yet Those Lovers scorne, whom that love doth possesse? Doe they call vertue there ungratefulnesse? XXXII Morpheus the lively sonne of deadlie Sleepe, Witnes of life to them that living die: A Prophet oft of hidden mysterie; A Poet eake as humors flye and creepe: Since thou in me so sure a hold doost keepe, That never I with clos'd up sence doe lye, But by thy worke, my Stella I discry, Teaching blind eyes both how to smile and weepe; Vouchsafe of all acquaintance this to tell, Whence hast thou Ivorie, Rubies, Pearle, and Golde, To shew her skin, lips, teeth, and head so well? (Foole aunswers he) no Indes such treasures hold, But from thy hart, while my Sire charmeth thee, Sweete Stellas Image I doe steale to me. XXXIII I might, unhappy word, (woe me) I might, And then would not, nor could not see my blisse: Tyll now, wrapt in a most infernall Night, I finde, how heavenly day (wretch) did I misse; Hart rent thy selfe, thou doost thy selfe but right. No lovely Paris made thy Helen his, No force, no fraude, robd thee of thy delight, No Fortune of thy fortune Author is; But to my selfe, my selfe did give the blow, While too much wit forsooth so troubled me, That I respects for both our sakes must showe. And could I not by rysing morne fore-see, How faire a day was neere, (Ã´ punisht eyes) That I had beene more foolish, or more wise. XXXIV Come let me write, and to what end? to ease A burthened hart, (how can words ease, which are The glasses of thy daily vexing care?) Oh, cruell fights well pictured forth doe please. Art not asham'd to publish thy disease? Nay, that may breede my fame, it is so rare, But will not wise men thinke thy words fonde ware? Then be they close, and they shall none displease, What idler thing than speake and not be heard? What harder thing than smart and not to speake? Peace foolish wit, with wit my wit is marde; Thus write I while I doubt to write, and wreake My harmes in ynkes poore losse, perhaps some finde Stellas great power, that so confus'd my minde. XXXV What may words say? or what may words not say, Where truth it selfe must speake like flattery? Within what boundes can one his lyking stay, Where Nature doth with excellence agree? What Nestors counsell can my flames allay, Since Reasons selfe doth blow the coles to me? And ah, what hope that hope should once see day, Where Cupid is sworne page to Chastitie; Honour is honoured, that thou dost possesse Him as thy slave, and now long needie Fame Doth even grow rich, meaning my Stellas name; Wit learnes in thee perfection to expresse, Not thou by praise, but praise in thee is raised, It is a praise, to praise where thou art praysed. XXXVI Stella, whence doth these newe assaults arise, A conquerd, yeelding, ransackt hart to win? Whereto long since, through my long battred eyes, Whole Armies of thy beauties entred in, And there long since, Love thy Lievetenant lyes, My forces raz'd, thy banners rais'd within; Of conquest what doe these effects suffise, But wilt new warre uppon thine owne begin, With so sweet voyce, and by sweet nature so, In sweetest strength, so sweetly skild withall, In all sweet stratagems sweete Arte can shew: That not my soule which at thy foote did fall Long sithence forst by thy beames; but stone nor tree By sences priviledge can scape from thee. XXXVIII Thus night while sleepe begins, with heavie wings To close mine eyes, and that my troubled thought Doth fall to stray, and my chiefe powers are brought To leave the scepter of all subject things, The first that straight my fancies errour brings Unto my minde, is Stellas image, wrought By Loves owne selfe, but with so curious draught, That she mee thinks not onely shines but sings: I start, looke hart, harke, but what inclos'd up sence Was helde, in open view it flyes away, Leaving me nought but wayling eloquence. I seeing bitter sights in sighes decay, Cald it anew, and woed Sleepe againe, But him her hoast her unkind guest had slaine. XXXIX Come Sleepe, Ã´ Sleepe, the certaine knot of peace, The bathing place of wits, the balme of woe, The poore mans wealth, the prysoners release, The indifferent Judge betweene the hie and lowe, With shielde of proofe, shielde me from out the presse Of these fierce dartes, Dispayre at me doth throw; O make in me those civill warres to cease: I will good trybute pay if thou doe soe. Take thou of me smooth pillowes, sweetest bed, A chamber deafe of noyse, and blinde of light, A rosie garland, and a wearie head. And if these things (as being thine in right) Moove not thy heavie grace, thou shalt in mee, (Livelier then els) rare Stellas Image see. XL As good to write, as for to lie and groane, O Stella deere, how much thy power hath wrought, That hast my minde now of the basest brought, My still kept course while others sleepe to moane; Alas if thou, the height of Vertues throane, Canst but vouchsafe the influence of a thought, Upon a wretch which long thy grace hath sought. Way then by thee how I am overthrowne; And then thinke thus, although thy beautie be Made manifest, by such a victorie, Yet noblest Conquerers doe wreaks avoide; Since then thou hast so farre subdued me, That in my hart I offer still to thee, O doe not let thy Temple be destroide. XLI Having this day, my horse, my hand, my Launce Guided so well, that I obtaind the prize, Both by the judgement of the English eyes, And of some sent by that sweet enmie Fraunce, Horsmen my skill in horsmanship advaunce, Towne folke my strength: a daintier Judge applies His praise to slight, which from good use doth rise: Some luckie wits, impute it but to chaunce: Others, because from both sides I doe take My blood, from them that doe excell in this, Thinke Nature me a man at Armes did make. How farre they shoote awry; the true cause is, Stella lookt on, and from her heavenly face, Sent forth her beames, which made so faire a race. XLII O eyes, which doe the Spheres of beautie move, Whose beames all joyes, whose joyes all vertues be: Who while they make Love conquer, conquer Love, The Schooles where Venus hath learnd Chastitie; O eyes, where humble lookes most glorious prove, Onely love tasting of your crueltie. Doe not, doe not, from me, poore me, remove, Keepe still my Zenith, ever shine on me; For thoughts eye never sees them, but straight waies My life forgets to nourish languisht sprights: Yet still on me (Ã´ eyes) dart downe your rayes; And if from Majestie of sacred Lights Oppressing mortall sence, my death proceede: Wreckes tryumphs best, which Love hie set doth breed. XLIII Faire eyes, sweet lips, deere hart, that foolish I Could hope by Cupids helpe, on you to pray: Since to himselfe he doth your gifts apply, As his maine force, chiefe sport, and easefull stay. For when he will see who dare him gainesay, Then with those eyes he lookes, loe by and by, Each soule doth at Loves feete his weapons lay, Glad if for her he give them leave to die. When he will play, then in her lips his eye, Where blushing red, that Loves selfe them doe love, With either lip he doth the other kisse; But when he will for quiets sake remove From all the world, her hart in then his roome: Where well he knowes, no man to him can come. XLIV My words I know doe well sette forth my minde, My minde, bemones his sence of inward smart: Such smart may pittie claime of any hart; Her hart, sweete hart, is of no Tygers kinde, And yet she heares, and I no pittie finde, But more I cry, lesse grace she doth impart; Alas, what cause is there so overthwart, That Noblenes it selfe makes thus unkinde? I much doe gesse, yet finde no truth but this, That when the breath of my complaints doe touch Those daintie doores unto the Court of Blisse, [The heavenly nature of that place is such:] That once come there, the sobs of my annoyes, Are metamorphos'd straight to tunes of joyes. XLV Stella oft sees the very face of woes Painted in my bewrinckled stormie face: But cannot skill to pittie my disgrace; No though the cause heereof herselfe she knowes. Yet Hermes late, a fable who did show, Of Lovers never knowne, (a pittious case) Pittie thereof got in her breast such place, As from her eyes, a Spring of teares did flow. Alas, if Fancie drawne by fained things, Though false, yet with free store more grace doth breede Then Servants wreck, where new doubt honor bringes, Than thinke my Deere, that in me you doe reede Of Lovers ruine some sad TragÃ¦die: And if not me, pittie the tale of me. XLVI I curst thee oft, I pittie now thy case, Blinde hitting Boy, since shee that thee and me Rules with a becke, so tyranniseth thee, That thou must want or foode or dwelling place; For she protests to bannish thee her face. Her face (Ã´ Love) a roge then should'st thou bee, If Love learne not alone to love and see, Without desire to feede of further grace. Alas poore wagge, that now a Scholler art To such a Schoole-mistris, whose lessons new Thou needes must misse, and so thou needes must smart; Yet deere, let me this pardon get of you, That he so long may sport him with desire, Till without Fuell, thou can make hote fire. XLVII What, have I thus betraide my libertie, Can those blacke beames, such burning markes engrave In my free side, or am I borne a slave, Whose necke becomes such yoke of tyrannie? Or want I sence to feele my miserie, Or spirit, disdaine of such disdaine to have, Who for long faith some gentle pittie crave, Yet get no almes, but scorne of beggerie. Vertue awake, beautie but beautie is; I may, I must, I can, I will, I doe Leave following that which it is gaine to misse, Let her goe: soft, but there she comes, goe to, Unkind I love you, not, (woe me) that I Must make my hart thus give my tongue the lye. XLVIII Soules joy, bend not those morning starres from me, Where vertue is made strong by beauties might, Where love is chastnes, scorning youthes delight, And humblenes is linckt with majestie; What ever may ensue, ah let me be Copartner of the ritches of that sight: Let not mine eyes be blinded from that light; Oh looke, oh shine, Ã´ let me die and see, For though I oft my selfe of them bemone, That through my hart their beamie darts be gone, Whose curelesse woundes even nowe most freshly bleede; Yet since my deaths wound is already got, Deere killer, spare not thy sweete cruell shot, A kind of grace it is to kill with speede. XLIX I on my horse, and Love on me doth trie Our horsmanship, while two strong works I prove, A horsman to my horse, a horse to Love; And now mans wrongs in me poore beast discry. The raines wherewith the ryder doth me tie Are reverent thoughts, which bit of reverence move, Curbde in with feare, but with gilt bosse above Of hope, which makes it seeme faire to the eye: The wande is will, thou fancie saddle art, Girt fast by memory; and while I spurre My horse, he spurres with sharpe desires my hart, He sits me fast how ever I do sturre, And now hath made me to his hand so right, That in the manage I my selfe delight. L Stella, the fulnes cannot staied be Of hidden thoughts, within my panting brest: But they doe swell and struggle forth of me, Till that in words thy figure be exprest; And yet as soone as they thus formed be, According to my Lord Loves owne behest, With sad eyes I their weake proportion see To portract what within this world is blest. So that I cannot chuse but write my minde, And cannot chuse but put out that I write, While those poore babes their death in birth doe find; And now my penne these lynes had dashed quite, But that they stop his furie from the same: Because their fore-front beares sweet Stellas name. LI Pardon mine eares, both I and they doe pray, So may your tongue still flauntingly proceede, To them that doe such entertainments neede; So may you still have something new to say On sillie me, doe not your burthen lay Of all the grave conceipts your braine doth breede: But find some Hercules, to beare (in steede Of Atlas tyrde) your wisedomes heavenly sway, For me while you discourse of courtly tydes, Of cunningst Fishers in most troubled streames, Of straying waves when valiant errour guides; Meane while my hart confers with Stellas beames, As pittie tis so sweete a Comedie, By such unfitted speech, should hindered be. LII A strife is growne betweene Vertue and Love, While each pretends, that Stella may be his: Her eyes, her lips, Love saith that he owes this, Since they doe weare his badge, most firmely prove; But Vertue thus, that title doth disprove. That Stella, (Ã´ deere name) that Stella is, That vertuous Soule, sure heyre of heavenly Blisse: Not this faire outside, which our hart doth move; And therefore, though her beauty and her grace, Be Loves indeede, in Stellas selfe he may By no pretence claime any manner place. Well Love, since this Demurre our sute doth staie, Let Vertue have that Stellas selfe, yet thus, That Vertue but that body graunt to us. LIII In Martiall sports I had my cunning tryde, And yet to breake more Staves I did adresse While people shoutes: indeede I must confesse, Youth, luck, and praise, filled my vaines with pride; When Cupid having me his slave discride, In Mars his liverie, prauncing in the presse, Now what sir foole said he (I would no lesse) Looke heere I say, I lookt, and Stella spide: Who hard by, through a window sent her light; My hart then quakt, then daz'led were my eyes, One hand forgot to rule, th'other to fight, No Trumpet sound I heard, nor freendly cries; My foe came on, and beate the ayre for mee, Till that her blush, taught me my shame to see. LIV Because I breathe not love to every one, Nor doe not use sette Colours for to weare: Nor nourish speciall locks with vowed haire, Nor give each speech a full point of a grone, The Courtly Nymphes acquainted with the mone Of them, which in their lips Loves Standard beare: What he, (say they of me) no I dare sweare, He cannot love: no, no, let him alone. And thinke so still, so Stella know my minde. Protest indeede, I know not Cupids dart: But how faire Maides, at length this true shall find, That his right badge, is learned in the hart. Dumbe Swans, not chattering Pyes doe Lovers prove, They love indeede, who dare not say they love. LV Fie schoole of Patience, fie, your Lesson is Far far too long, to learne it without booke: What, a whole weeke, and get not halfe a looke? And thinke I should not your large precepts misse, When I might reade these Letters fayre of blisse, Within her face each vertue I could brooke, From what the leaden counsels that I tooke: As of a freende which meant not much amisse. But now alas, that I doe want her sight, What doost thou thinke that I can evertake, In thy colde strife, a phlegmatick delight? No Patience, if thou wilt my good, then make Her come, and heere with patience my desire: And then with patience bid me beare my fire. LVI Muses, I oft have crav'd your holy ayde, With choisest flowres, my speech t'engarland so, That it disguisde, in true (but naked) show, Might winne some grace in your sweet skill arraide; And oft whole troupes of saddest words I said, Striving abroade; a forraging to goe, Untill by your inspiring I might know, How the blacke banners might be best displaid. But I meane now no more your helpe to prove. No other sugering of speech to try, But on her name uncessantly to cry. For let me but name her whom I doe love, So sweete sounde straight my eares and hart doe hit, That I well finde no eloquence to it. LVII Woe having made with many sighs his owne Each sence of mine; each gift, each power of minde Growne now his slaves, he forst them out to finde The throwest words, fit for Woes selfe to grone Hoping that when they might finde Stella alone, Before she could prepare to be unkind, Her soule (armed with such a daintie rinde,) Should soone be hurt with sharpnes of the mone. She heard my plaints, and did not onely heare, But them so sweet, she did most sweetly sing, With that faire brest, making Woes darknes cleere, My privie cares I holpe to her to bring, To tell my griefe, and she with face and voice, So sweetes my paines, that my paines me rejoyce. LVIII Doubt there hath beene, when with his golden chaine The Orator so farre mens harts doth bind: That no place els their giddie steps could find; But as he them more slacker short did raine, Whether with words his sov'raigntie he gaine, Clothed with fine tropes as his strongest linde, Or els pronouncing grace, wherewith his minde Prints his owne forme lively, in rudest braine. Now judge by this, in pearcing phrases late The Anatomie of all my woes I wrate, Stellas sweete breath the same to me did reede. Oh voyce, oh face, mauger my speeches might, Which wooed words, most ravishing delight, Even those sad words a joy to me did breede. LIX Deere, why make you more of a dogge than me? If he doe love, alas I burne in love; If he waite well, I never thence would move; If he be faire, yet but a dogge can be; Little he is, so little worth is he: He barkes, my songs in one voice oft doth prove; Bidden, (perhaps) he fetcheth thee a glove; But I unbid, fetch even my soule to thee. Yet while I languish, him that bosome clips, That lap doth lap, nay lets in spight of spight This fauning mate tast of those sugred lips; Alas, if you graunt onely such delight To witles things, then Love I hope, (since wit Becomes a clogge) will soone ease me of it. LX When my good Angell guides me to the place Where's al my good; I doe in Stella see, That Heavenly joyes throwes onely downe on me Thundred disdaines, and Lightning of disgrace; But when the ruggedst step of Fortunes race Makes me fall from her sight, then sweetly she With words, wherein the Muses Treasures be, Shewes love and pittie to my absent case. Now I (with beating long, by hardest fate) So dull am, that I cannot looke into The ground of this fierce love, and loving hate; Then some good body tell me how to do, Whose presence absence, absence presence is: Blest in my curse, and curssed in my blisse. LXI Oft with true sighes, oft with uncalled teares, Now with slow words, now with dumbe eloquence, I Stellas eyes assailde, I closde her eares, But this at last is her sweetest defence; That who indeede a sound affection beares, So captives to his Saint both soule and mind, That wholie Hers, all selfnes hee forbeares. Thence his desire he learnes, his lives course thence, Now since this chast love, hates this love in mee; With chastned minde I needes must shew, that shee Shall quickly me from what she hates remove. O Doctor Cupid, thou for me reply: Driven else to graunt by Angell Sophistry, That I love not, without I leave to love. LXII Late tyr'd with woe, even ready for to pine With rage of love, I call my Love unkinde. Shee in whose eyes, loves fyres unfelt doe shine, Sweetlie saide; I true love in her shoulde finde. I joy, but straight thus watred was my wine: That love she did, but with a love not blinde. Which would not let me, whome she lov'd decline, From Nobler course, fit for my birth and minde. And therefore by her loves Authoritie; Wilde me these Tempests of vaine love to flee: And Anchor fast my selfe on vertues shore. Alas if this the onelie mettall be, Of love newe coyn'd to helpe my beggery: Deere, love me not, that you may love me more. LXIII Oh Grammer rules, oh now your vertues showe, So Children still read you with awfull eyes, As my younge Dove may in your precepts wise, Her graunt to me by her owne vertue knowe. For late with hart most hie, with eyes most lowe; I crav'd the thing which ever she denies. Shee lightening Love, displaying Venus skyes, Least one should not be heard twise, said no no. [Sing then my Muse, now I do PÃ¦an sing.] Harken Envy not at my high triumphing: But Grammers force with sweete successe confirme, For Grammer sayes ah (this deere Stella way) For Grammer sayes (to Grammer who sayes nay) That in one speech, two negatives affirme. LXIV No more my deere, no more these Counsels try, O give my passions leave to runne their race: Let Fortune lay on me her worst disgrace. Let Folke orechargde with braine against me cry, Let Cloudes be dimme, my fate bereaves myne eyes, Let me no steps but of lost labour try, Let all the earth in scorne recount my race; But doe not will me from my love to fly. I doe not envye Aristotles wit, Nor doe aspire to CÃ¦sars bleeding fame: Nor ought to care though some above me sit; Nor hope nor wish an other course to frame: But that which once may winne thy cruell hart, Thou art my wit; and thou my vertue art. LXV Love, by sure proofe I may call thee unkinde, That gives no better eares to my just cryes: Thou whom to me, such my good turnes shouldst binde, As I may well account, but cannot prise. For when nak'd boy, thou couldst no harbour finde In this olde world, (growne now so too too wise) I lodg'de thee in my heart; and being blinde By nature borne, I gave to thee my eyes. Mine eyes, my light, my life, my hart alas, If so great services may scorned be: Yet let this thought thy Tygirsh courage passe, That I perhaps am somewhat kin to thee; Since in thine armes, of Fame most truely spred, Thou bearst the Arrowe, I the Arrowhed. LXVI And doe I see some cause of hope to finde? Or doth the tedious burthen of long woe In weakned mindes, quicke apprehension breede Of every Image which may comfort showe. I cannot brag of word, much lesse of deede, Fortunes windes still with me in one sorte blowe: My wealth no more, and no whit lesse my neede, Desier, still on stilts of feare doth goe. And yet amids all feares, a hope there is Stolne to my hart: since last faire night (nay day) Stellas eyes sent to me the beames of blisse, Looking on mee, I looke an other way: But when mine eyes blacke to their heaven did move: They fled with blush, which guiltie seem'd of love. LXVII Hope art thou true or doost thou flatter me? Doth Stella now beginne, with pitteous eye The raigne of this her conquest to espie? Will she take time before all wracked be? Her eye speech is translated thus by thee. But failste thou not in phrase so heavenly hye? Looke ore againe, the faire text better prie; What blushing notes dost thou in Margent see? What sighes stolne out, or kild before full borne Hast thou found such and such like arguments? Or art thou els to comfort me forsworne? Well how so ere thou doost interpret my contents, I am resolv'd thy error to maintaine: Rather than by more trueth to get more paine. LXVIII Stella, the onely Plannet of my light, Light of my life, and life of my desire, Cheife good, whereto my hope doth sole aspire; World of my wealth and heaven of my delight. Why doost thou spend the Treasure of thy sprite With voice more fit to wed Amphyons Lyre? Seeking to quench in me the noble fyre, Set by thy wrath and kindled by thy sight. And all in vaine, for while thy breath so sweete With choisest words; thy wordes with reasons rare: Thy reasons firmely set, are vertues feete, Labour to kill in me this killing care O thinke I then, what Paradise of joy It is, so faire a vertue to annoy. LXIX Oh joy, too high for my Love still to showe, Oh blisse, fit for a nobler seat than mee, Envie put out thine eyes, least thou doe see What Oceans of delight, in me doth flowe. My friend that oft saw'st through all maskes, my woe, Come, come, and let me poure my selfe in thee: Gone is the winter of my miserie. My Spring appeares, loe see what heere doth growe, For Stella hath with wordes (where faith doth shine) Of her high hart given me the Monarchie: And Io, I may say that she is mine. And though she give but this condicionally, This Realme of blisse, while vertues course I take; No Kings be Crownd, but they some covenant make. LXX My Muse may well grudge at my heavenly joy, Yf still I force her thus in woe to weepe; She oft hath drunke my teares, now hopes t'enjoy Nectar of mirth; since I Joves Cupid keepe. Sonnets be not bound Prentice to annoy, Trebbles sing high, so well as bases deepe: Griefe but Loves winter liverie, the boy Hath cheekes to smile, so well as eyes to weepe. Come then my Muse, shewe the force of delight In well raisde noates; my pen the best it may Shall paint out joy, though but in blacke and white. Cease eager Muse, peace pen, for my sake stay, I give you heere my hand, for truth of this: Wise silence is best Musique unto blisse. LXXI Who will in fayrest booke of nature knowe, How Vertue may best lodgde in Beautie bee, Let him but learne of love to read in thee Stella, those faire lines which true Beautie showe. There shall he finde all vices overthrowe; Not by rude force, but sweetest soveraigntie Of reason, from whose light, the night birdes flie; That inward Sunne in thine eyes shineth so. And not content to be perfections heir, Thy selfe dost strive all mindes that way to move: Who marking thee, which art indeede most faire, See while thy beautie drives my hart to love, As fast thy vertue bends that love to good: But ah, Desire still cries, give me some food. LXXII Desire, though thou my olde commpanion art, And oft so clinges to my pure Love; that I One from the other scarcely can discry: While each doe blowe the fier of my hart; Now from thy fellowship I needes must part. Venus is taught with Dians wings to flye, I must no more in thy sweet passions lye: Vertues golde now, must head my Cupids dart, Service and honour wonder with delight, Feare to offend, well worthy to appeare: Care shining in mine eyes, faith in my spright, These thinges are left me by my onely deare. But thou Desire, because thou wouldst have all: Now banisht art, but yet within my call. LXXIII Love still a Boy, and oft a wanton is, Schoolde only by his Mothers tender eye: What wonder then if he his lesson misse, When for so soft a rod deare play he trye. And yet my starre, because a sugred kisse, In sport I sucke, while she a sleepe doth lye: Doth lowre, naye chide, nay threat for onely this: Sweet it was saucy love, that prest so nye. But no scuse serves, she makes her wrath appeare In Beauties throne, see now who dares come neere Those scarlet Judges, threatning blooddie paine. O heavenly Foole, thy most kisse worthy face Anger invests with such a lovely grace, That Angers selfe I needes must kisse againe. LXXIV I never dranke of Aganippe well, Nor never did in shade of Tempe sit: And Muses scorne with vulgar braines to dwell, Poore Lay-man I, for sacred rites unfit. Some doe I heare of Poets fury tell, But God wot, wot not what they meane by it: And this I sweare by blackest brooke of hell, I am no Pickepurse of an others wit. How fals it than, that with so smooth an ease My thoughts I speake? And what I speake I showe In verse; and that my verse best wittes doth please, Gesse we the cause. What is it this? fie no. Or so? much lesse. How then? sure thus it is; My lips are sure inspir'd with Stellas kisse. LXXV Of all the Kings that ever heere did raigne, Edward namde fourth, as first in praise I name: Not for his faire outside, nor well linde braine, Although lesse guift, are fethers of high fame. Nor that he could young wise, wise valliant frame His Syres revenge, joynde with a kingdomes gaine: And gaind by Mars, could yet make Mars so tame, That ballance waide what sword did late obtaine. Nor that he made the Flower deluce so fraide, Though strongly hedgd of bloody Lyons pawes: That wittie Lewes to him a tribuite paide; Nor this nor that, nor any such small cause, But onely, for this worthy King durst prove, To loose his Crowne, rather then loose his Love. LXXVI Shee comes, and straight therewith her shining twins do move Their raies to me: who in her tedious absence lay Bath'de in cold woe; but now appeares my shining day, The onely light of joy, the onely warmth of Love. Shee comes with light and warmth, which like Aurora prove; Of gentle face, so that my eyes dare gladly play With such a rosy Morne: whose beames both fresh and gay Scorch not; but onely doe darke chillinge spirits remove. But loe, while I doe speake it groweth noone with me, Her flamy glittering lights increase with time and place: My heart cryes oh it burnes, mine eyes now dazled be: No winde, no shade, no coole: what helpe then in my case? But with short breath, long lookes, staide feete and waking hed, Pray that my Sunne goe downe with meeker beames to bed. LXXVII Those lookes, whose beames my joy, whose motion is delight, That face whose lecture shewes what perfect Beautie is: That presence which doth give darke hearts a living light, That grace, which Venus weepes that she her selfe did misse. That hand, which without touch, holdes more than Atlas might, Those lips, which makes deathes pay a meane prise for a kisse: That skin, whose passing hue scornes this poore tearme of white, Those words that doe sublime the quintessence of blisse. That voice which makes the soule plant himselfe in the eares, That conversation sweet, where such high comforts be: As constru'd in true speech, the name of heaven it beares. Makes me in my best thoughts, and quiet judgements see, That in no more but this I mightt be fully blest: Yet ah, my mayden Muse doth blush to tell the best. LXXVIII Oh how the pleasant ayres, of true Love bee Infected by those vapours, which arise From out that noysome gulfe: which gaping lies Betweene the jawes of hellish Jelousey. A Monster, others harmes, selfe misery. Beauties plague, Vertues scurdge, succour of lyes: Who his owne joy to his owne heart applyes, And onely cherrish doth with injuries: Who since he hath by natures speciall grace, So pearsing pawes as spoyle when they embrace, So nimble feete as stirre though still on thornes, So manie eyes as seeking their owne woe. So ample eares, that never good newes knowe, Is it not ill that such a beast wants hornes? LXXIX Sweete kisse, thy sweetes I faine would sweetely indite, Which even of sweetnes, sweetest sweeter art; Pleasing consort, where each sense holdeth part, With coopling Doves guides Venus chariot right, Best charge and brav'st retraite in Cupids fight, A double key which openeth to the harts, Most ritch when most his ritches it impartes. Nest of yong joyes, Scholemaster of delight, Teaching the meanes at once to take and give, The friendly fray where blows do wound and heale, The prettie death while each in other live, Poore haps first wealth a pledge of promised weale, Breakfast of love, but loe, loe where shee is, Cease we to praise, now praie wee for a kisse. LXXX Sweet swelling lip well maist thou swell in pride, Since best wittes thinke it best thee to admire, Natures praise, vertues stall, Cupids cold fire, Whence words, not words but heavenly graces slyde, The newe Pernassus where the Graces byde: Sweetnes of Musique, Wisedomes beautifier, Breather of life, and fastnesse of desire, Where Beauties blush in Honors graine is dyde. Thus much my heart my mouth compeld to say: But now, spite of my heart my tongue will stay, Loathing all lyes, doubting this flattrie is, And no spurre can this restie race refraine; Wherefore to trie if that I said be true, How can I better prove then with a kisse? LXXXI O kisse which doth those ruddie gems impart, Or joyes or fruits of new found Parradise, Breathing all blisse and sweetnes to the hart, Teaching dumbe lips a nobler exercise. O kisse which soules even soules together ties By linkes of love, and onely natures Art, How faine would I paint thee to all mens eies, Or of thy gifts at least set out some part? But shee forbids, with blushing words shee saies, Shee builds hir fame on higher seated praise: But my heart burnes, I cannot silent be, Then since deare kisse you faine would have me peace, And I (mad with delight) want wit to cease, Stop you my mouth with still still kissing me. LXXXII Nymph of the garden where all beauties be, Beauties which doe in excellence surpasse, His whose till death lockt in a watry glasse, Or hir whom nak'd the Troian boy did see. Sweete garden Nymph which keepes the Cherry tree, Whose fruit doth far the Hesperian tast surpasse, Most sweete faire, most faire sweete, doe not alasse From comming neere these Cherries banish mee, For though full of desire, emptie of wit, Admitted late by your best graced grace, I caught at one of them a hungry bit, Pardon that fault, once more graunt me the place, And so I sweare by the selfe same delite, I will but kisse, I never more will bite. LXXXIII Good brother Phillip I have forborne you long, I was content you should in favour creepe, While craftely you seemed your Cut to keepe, As though that faire soft hand did you great wrong: I beare with envy, yet I heare your song, When in hir necke you did love ditties peepe, Nay, (more foole I) oft suffred you to sleepe, In lillies nest where Loves selfe lies along, What? doth high place ambitious thoughts augment? Is saucines reward of curtesie? Cannot such grace your silly selfe content, But you must needes with those lips billing be? And through those lips drinke Nectar from that tung, Leave that Syr Phillip lest your necke be wrung. LXXXIV High way since you my chiefe Pernassus be, And that my Muse to some eares not unmeete, Tempers hir words to trampling horses feete, More often than a Chamber mellodie, Now blessed you beare onwards blessed me, To hir where my heart safeliest shall meete, My Muse and I must you of duety greete, With thanks and wishes wishing thankfully; Be you still carefull kept by publike heede, By no encrochment wrongd, nor time forgot, Nor blam'd for bloud, nor sham'd for sinfull deede, And that you know I envie you no whit, Of highest wish, I wish you so much blisse, Hundreds of yeares you Stellas feete may kisse. LXXXV Behold my heart the house that thee contains, Beware full Sailes drown not thy tottering Barge, Least joy by nature apt (spirites to enlarge) Thee to thy wracke beyond thy limits straines, Nor doe like Lords whose weake confused braines, Not pointing to fit folks each undercharge, Strive in themselves each office to discharge, With doing all leave nothing done but paine, But give apt servants their due place; let eies See beauties totall sum found in their face, Let eares heare speach which will to wonder tyes, Let breath sucke up those sweets, let armes imbrace. [The Globe of weale, lipps Lov's Indentures make. Thou but of all the kingly tribute take.] LXXXVI Alas whence comes this change of lookes? If I Have chang'd deserts, let mine owne conscience be A still felt plague to selfe condemning mee. Let woe grype on my heart, shame load mine eyes: But if all faith like spotles Ermine lye Safe in my soule (which onely doth to thee As his sole object to felicitie With wings of Love in aire of wonder flie.) Cease your hard hand, threat not so hard your slave, In Justice, paines come not till faults do call: Or if I needes (sweet Judge) must torments have, Seeke some thing else to chasten mee withall, Than those blest eyes where all my hopes do dwell, No doome shall make ones Heaven become his Hell. LXXXVII When I was forst from Stella ever deare, Stella, foode of my thoughts, hurt of my heart: Stella, whose eyes make all my temples cleare, By Stellaes lawes, of duetie to impart, Alas I found that shee with mee did smart: I sawe that teares did in her eyes appeare: I sawe that sighes her sweetest lips did part: And her sad wordes my sad deare sense did heare. For mee, I weepe to see Pearles scattered so: I sighd her sighes, and wailed for her woe: Yet swamme in joy such love in her was seene. Thus while the effect most bitter was to mee, And than the cause nothing more sweet could be, I had beene vext, if vext I had not beene. LXXXVIII Out Traytour absence dar'st thou counsell mee From my deare Conquerour to runne awaie, Because in brave arraye here marcheth shee That to entice mee profers present paye. Is Faith so weake, or is such force in thee? When Sunne is hid, can Starres such beames displaie? Cannot Heavens foode once felt keepe stomacks free From base desire on earthly cates to praie? When absence with her mistes obscures her light, My Orphan sense slides to the inward sight: Where memorie feeds foorth the beames of Love, That where before heart lov'd and eyes did see, In heart my sight and Love both coupled be, United powres make eche the stronger prove. LXXXIX Now that of absence the most yrksome night, With darkest shade doth overcome the daie: Since Stellaes eyes that wont give mee my daie, Leaving my Hemisphere o'recast with night, Each day seemes long, and longs for long staied night: The night as tedious, wooes th'approch of day: Toyled with dustie toyles of busie day, Languisht with horrors of the silent night, Suffering the evils both of daie and night, While no night is more darke than is my daie, Nor no daie hath lesse quiet than my night: With such bad mixture of my night and daie, That living thus in blackest Winter night, I feele the gleames of hottest Sommers daie. XC Stella, thinke not that I by verse seeke fame, Who seeke, who hope, who love, who like, but thee: Thine eyes my pride, thy lips my historie, If thou praise mee, all other praise is shame. Nor so ambitious am I, as to frame A nest for my yong praise in Lawrell tree, In trueth I sweare, I wish not there should be Graved in my Epitaph a Poets name. Nor if I would could I just title make That anie laud thereof to me should growe Without my Payns from others wings I take; For nothing from my wit or will doth flowe: Since all my wordes thy beautie doth indite, And Love doth hold my hand, &amp; makes me write. XCI Stella, while now by honours cruell might, I am from you (light of my light) misled, And whiles faire you, my Sunne thus overspred With absence vale I live in sorrowes night. If this darke place yet shewe by candle light Some Beauties peece, as amber collourd hed, Milke hands, rose cheekes, or lips more sweet more red, Or seeming jett black, yet in blacknes bright. They please I do confesse, they please mine eyes, But whie? because of you they moddels be; Moddels such be wood globes of glistering skyes: Deare therefore be not jealous over me, If you heare that they seeme my heart to move, Not them, no no, but you in them I love. XCII Be your wordes made (good sir) of Indian ware, That you allowe them mee by so small rate, Or do you the Caconians imitate, Or do you meane my tender eares to spare, That to my questions you so totall are? When I demaund of Phoenix Stellaes state, You saie (forsooth) you left her well too late. O God, thinke you that satisfies my care? I would know whether shee did sit or walke: How cloathd: how waited on: sighd shee or smilde: Whereof: with whome: how often did shee talke: With what pastimes, times jorneys shee beguild? If her lips daine to sweeten my poore name? Saie all: and all well said: saie still the same. XCIII O fate or fault, O curst child of my blisse, What sobs can give wordes grace my griefe to show? What inke is black enough to paint my woe? Through mee, wretch mee, even Stella vexed is: Yet Trueth, if Caitives brath might call thee his, Witnes with mee, that I foole stumbling fell: For carelesnes did in no manner growe, But wit confusd with too much care did misse. And do I then my selfe this vaine scuse give: I do sweete Love, and knowe this harmed thee. The world quit mee, shal I my selfe forgive? Onely with paines thy paines thus eased be: That all thy hurtes in my hearts wracke I reed I crye thy sighs (my deare) thy teares I bleed. XCIV Greefe find the words, for thou hast made my vaine So darke with mistie vapours which arise From out thy heavie mould, that even mine eyes Can scarce discerne the shape of mine owne paine: Do thou then (for thou canst) do thou complaine For my poore soule which wit that sicknes tries, Which even to sense, sense of it selfe denies. Though harbengers of death and of his traine, The execution of my fate forbeares, As of a Caitife not vouchsaft to die: Yet shewe thy hate of life in living teares: That though in wretchednes thy life doth lie, Thou maist more wretched be than nature beares: As being plast in such a wretch as I. XCV Yet sighes, deare sighes, indeede true friends you are, That do not leave your best friend at the wurst: But as you with my brest I oft have nurst: So gratefull now you wait upon my care. Faint coward Joye, no longer tarrie dare, Seeing hope did yeeld when this woe strake him first, Delight exclaims he is for my fault curst, Although my mate in Armes himselfe he sware, Nay Sorrow in as great a rage as hee, Kills his owne children Teares, finding that they By Love were made apt to consort with mee, Onely true Sighes, you do not go away: Thank may you have for such a thankfull part: Thank worthiest yet, when you shall breake my heart. XCVI Though with good cause thou lik'st so well the night, Since kind or chaunce gives both one libertie, Both sadly blacke, both blackly darkned be: Night bard from Sunne, thou from thine own Sunnes light Silence in both displaies his sullen might: Slowe Heavens in both do hold the one degree, That full of doubts, thou of perplexitie: Thy teares expresse nights native moysture right, In both a wofull solitarines: In night of Spirits the gastly power sturr, And in our sprites are Spirits gastlines: But but (alas) nights sights the ods hath furr, For that at length invites us to some rest, Thou though still tyr'd, yet still dost it detest. XCVII Dian that faine would cheare her friend the Night, Doth shewe her oft at full her fairest face, Bringing with her those starrie Nymphs, whose chace From heavenly standing hurts eche mortall wight. But ah poore Night in love with Phoebus light, And endlesly dispairing of his grace, Her selfe to shewe no other joy hath place, Sylent and sad in moorning weeds doth dight: Even so (alas) a Ladie Dians peere, With choise delight and rarest company, Would faine drive clouds from out my heavie cheere: But woe is mee, though joy her selfe were shee, Shee could not shewe my blind braine waies of joy While I dispaire my Sunnes light to enjoy. XCVIII Ah bed the feeld where joyes peace some do see: The feeld where al my thoughts to war be traind, How is thy grace by my strange fortune staind? How thy low shrowdes by my sighs stormed be? With sweet soft shades thou oft invitest mee To steale some rest, but wretch I am constrained, Spurd with Loves spurr, this held &amp; shortly rained With Cares hard hand, to turne and tosse in thee, While the black horrors of the silent night, Paint Woes black face so lively in my sight, That tedious leasure markes eche wrinckled line: But when Aurora leades out PhÅbus daunce, Mine eyes then onely winke for spite perchaunce, That wormes should have their Sunne &amp; I want mine. XCIX When farre spent night perswades each mortal eie To whome nor Art nor Nature graunted light: To laye his then marke wanting shaftes of sight, Clos'd with their quivers in Sleeps armorie; With windowes ope then most my heart doth lye Viewing the shape of darknes and delight, And takes that sad hue, with which inward might Of his mazde powres he keepes just harmony: But when birds chirpe and aire, sweete aire which is Mornes messenger with rose enameld skyes Calls each wight to salute the heaven of blisse; Intombd of lids then buried are mine eies, Forst by their Lord who is ashamd to find Such light in sense with such a darkned mind. C Oh teares, no teares, but shoures from beauties skies, Making those Lilies and those Roses growe, Which aie most faire now fairer needs must show, While grateful pitty Beauty beautifies, Oh minded sighs that from that breast doe rise, Whose pants doe make unspilling Creame to flow, Winged with woes breath so doth Zephire blow As might refresh the hel where my soule fries, Oh plaints conserv'd in such a sugred phrase, That eloquence envies, and yet doth praise, While sightd out words a perfect musicke give: Such teares, sighs, plaints, no sorrow is, but joy: Or if such heavenly sighs must prove annoy, All mirth farewel, let me in sorrow live. CI Stella is sicke, and in that sick-bed lyes Sweetenes, that breathes and pants as oft as she: And Grace sicke too, such fine conclusions tries, That Sicknes brings it selfe best grac'd to bee. Beautie is sicke, but sicke in such faire guise, That in that palenes Beauties white we see, And Joy which is unsever'd from those eyes. Stella now learnes, (strange case) to weepe with me, Love moves thy paine and like a faithful page, As thy looks sturre, runs up and downe to make All folkes prest at thy wil thy paine to swage, Nature with care seeks for hir darlings sake, Knowing worlds passe, ere she enough can finde Of such heaven stuffe to cloath so heavenly minde. CII Where be those Roses, which so sweetned earst our eies? Where be those red cheekes, which fair increase did frame No hight of honor in the kindly badge of shame, Who hath the crimson weeds stoln fr? the morning skies? How doth the coullor fade of those vermillion eies, Which Nature self did make and self engrave the same? I would know by what right this palenes overcame That hue, whose force my heart in so great thraldome ties? Gallens adopted sonnes, who by a beaten way Their judgements hackney on, the fault of sicknes lay: But feeling proofe makes me say, they mistake it sure, It is but love that makes this paper perfect white, To write therein more fresh the storie of Delight, Whiles Beauties reddest incke Venus for him doth stir. CIII O happie Thames that didst my Stella beare, I saw thee with full many a smiling line Upon thy cheereful face Joves Livery weare: While those faire Plannets on thy streames did shine, The boat for joy could not to dance forbeare, While wanton winds with beautie so divine Ravisht, staid not, til in her golden haire They did themselves (Ã´ sweetest prison) twine. But faine those friendly windes there would their stay Have made, but forst by Nature still to flie, First did with puffing kisse those Lockes display: She so discovered, blusht. From window I With sight thereof cride out; Ah faire disgrace, Let honours selfe to thee graunt highest place. CIV Envious wits what hath beene mine offence, That with such poisoned care my wits you marke, That to each word, nay sigh of mine you harke, As grudging me my sorrows eloquence? Ah, is it not enough, that I am thence: Thence, so farre thence, that scantly anie sparke Of comfort dare come to this dungeon darke Where rigorous exile lockes up al my sense: But if I by a happie window passe, If I but Starres upon mine Armour beare Sicke, thirstie, glad (though but of empty glasse) Your morals note straight my hid meaning there, From out my ribs a whirlewind proves that I Doe Stella love fooles, who doth it denie? CV Unhappie sight and hath shee vanisht by, So neere, in so good time so free a place, Dead glasse dost thou thine object so imbrace, As what my heart still sees thou canst not spie, I sweare by hir Love and my lacke, that I Was not in fault that bent my dazling race Onely unto the heaven of Stellaes face, Counting but dust that in hir way did lie: But cease mine eies, your teares doe witnes well, That you guiltles therefore your necklace mist, Curst be the Page from whom the bad torch fell, Curst be the night which did your will resist, Curst be the Cochman that did drive so fast, With no lesse curse then absence makes me tast. CVI O absent presence Stella is not here, False flattering hope that with so faire a face, Bare me in hand that in this Orphane place, Stella I saw, my Stella should appeare, What saist thou now, where is that daintie cleare Thou wouldst mine eies should helpe their famisht case: But how art thou? now that selfe felt disgrace Doth make me most to wish thy comfort nere. But heere I doe store of faire Ladies meete, Who may with charme of conversation sweete Make in my heavie mould new thoughts to grow: Sure they prevaile as much with me, as he That bad his friend but then new maimed to be Merrie with him, and so forget his woe. CVII Stella since thou so right a Princesse art Of all the Powers which life bestowe on me, That ere by them ought undertaken be, They first resort unto that soveraigne part; Sweete for a time give respite to my heart, Which pants as though it stil should leape to thee: And on my thought give the Lievetenancie To this great cause, which needes both wit and Art, And as a Queene who from hir presence sends Whom shee emploies, dismisse from thee my wit, Still to have wrought that thy owne will attends, For servants shame of Maisters blame doth sit. O let not Fooles in me thy works approve, And scorning say, see what it is to love. CVIII When sorrow (using my owne Siers might) Melts downe his lead into my boyling brest, Through that darke Furnace of my heart opprest, There shines a joy from thee my onely light: But soone as thought of thee breeds my delight, And my young soule once flutters to hir nest, Most dead dispaire my daily unbidden guest Clips strait my wings, strait wraps me in his night, And makes me then bow downe my head and say, Ah what doth PhÅbus gold that wretch availe Whom Iron darts doth keepe from use of daie, So strangely (alas) thy works on me prevaile, That in my woes for thee, thou art my joy; And in my joyes for thee, my onel' anoy. OTHER SONNETS OF VARIABLE VERSE. First Sonnet. [Doubt you to whom my Muse these notes intendeth] [1] Doubt you to whom my Muse these notes intendeth, Which now my brest surchargd with musick lendeth? To you, to you all song of praise is due, Onely in you my song begins and endeth. 2 Who hath the eyes which marrie state with pleasure, Who keepes the key of Natures chiefest treasure: To you, to you al song of praise be due, Onely for you the heavens forget all measure. 3 Who hath the lips where wit with fairenes raigneth, Who womenkinde at once both decks and staineth: To you, to you all song of praise is due, Onely by you Cupid his crowne maintaineth. 4 Who hath the feet whose steps al sweetnes planteth, Who els for whom Fame worthie trumpets wanteth: To you, to you all song of praise be due, Onely to you her scepter Venus granteth. 5 Who hath the brest whose milk doth patience nurish, Whose grace is such, that when it chides doth cherish: To you, to you al song of praise be due, Onely through you the tree of life doth flourish. 6 Who hath the hand which without stroke subdueth Who long hid beautie with encrease reneueth: To you, to you al song of praise is due, Onely at you al envie hopelesse endeth. 7 Who hath the haire which most loose most fast tieth, Who makes a man live then glad when he dieth: To you, to you al song of praise is due, Onely of you the flattrer never lieth. 8 Who hath the voyce which soule from senses sunders, Whose force but yours the bolt of beautie thunders? To you, to you al song of praise is due, Onely with you no miracles are wonders. 9 Doubt you to whom my Muse these notes intendeth, Which now my breast orechargd with musicke lendeth? To you, to you al song of praise is due, Onely in you my song begins and endeth. Second Sonnet. [Have I caught my heavenly Juel] [1] Have I caught my heavenly Juel Teaching Sleepe most faire to be: Now wil I teach her, that she When she wakes is too too cruel. 2 Since sweete Sleep her eyes hath charmed, The two onely darts of Love: Now will I with that Boy prove Some play while he is disarmed. 3 Her tongue waking stil refuseth, Giving franklie niggard no: Now wil I attempt to knowe, What no her tongue sleeping useth. 4 See the hand that waking gardeth, Sleeping grants a free resort: Now I wil invade the fort, Cowards Love with losse rewardeth. 5 But (O foole) thinke of the danger Of her just and high disdaine, Now will I (alas) refraine Love feares nothing else but anger. 6 Yet those lippes so sweetly swelling, Do invite a stealing kisse; Now but venture will I this, Who will read must first learne spelling. 7 Oh sweet kisse, but ah shee is waking, Lowring beautie chastens mee. Now will I for feare hence flee, Foole, more Foole for no more taking. Third Sonnet. [If Orpheus voyce had force to breathe such musicks Love] [1] If Orpheus voyce had force to breathe such musicks Love Through pores of senseles trees, as it could make them move; If stones good measure daunst the Thebane walls to builde, To cadence of the tunes which Amphions Lyre did yeeld, More cause a like effect at least wise bringeth. O stones, Ã´ trees, learne hearing, Stella singeth, 2 If Love might sweeten so a boy of Shepheards brood, To make a Lyzard dull to taste Loves food: If Eagle fierce could so in Grecian maide delight, As her eyes were his light, her death his endlesse night: Earth gave that Love, heaven (I trow) Love refineth. O Beasts, Ã´ Birds, looke Love; for Stella shineth. 3 The beasts, birds, stones, &amp; trees feele this, &amp; feeling love: And if the trees, nor stones stirre not the same to prove, Nor beasts, nor birds doo come unto this blessed gaze; Know that smal Love is quick, and great Love doth amaze; They are amaz'd, but you with reason armed, O eies O eares of men, how are you charmed? Fourth Sonnet. [Onely Joy, now here you are] [1] Onely Joy, now here you are, Fit to heare and ease my care; Let my whispering voyce obtaine Sweete rewards for sharpest paine: Take me to thee, and thee to mee: No no no no, my Deare let bee. 2 Night hath closde all in her cloke, Twinckling starres love thoughts provoke, Danger hence good care doth keepe, Jealozie himselfe doth sleepe: Take mee to thee, and thee to mee: No no no no, my Deare let bee. 3 Better place no wit can finde Cupids knot to loose or binde, These sweete flowers, our fine bed too, Us in their best language wooe: Take me to thee, and thee to mee: No no no no, my Deare let be. 4 This smal light the Moone bestoes, Serves thy beames for to disclose, So to raise my heart more hie; Feare not, els none can us spie: Take me to thee and thee to mee. No no no no, my Deare let bee. 5 That you heard was but a mouse, Dumbe Sleepe holdeth all the house, Yet a sleepe (me thinkes) they say, Yong fooles, take time while you may: Take me to thee, and thee to mee. No no no no, my Deare let bee. 6 Niggard time threates if we misse This large offer of our blisse, Long stay ere she graunt the same: Sweet then, while ech thing doth frame Take me to thee and thee to mee. No no no no, my Deare let bee. 7 Your faire Mother is a bed, Candles out, and curtaines spred; She thinkes you doo letters write: Write, but first let me endite. Take mee to thee, and thee to mee: No no no no, my Deare let be. 8 Sweete, alas why strive you thus? Concord better fitteth us; Leave to Mars the force of hands, Your power in your beautie stands. Take me to thee, and thee to mee. No no no no, my Deare let bee. 9 Woe to mee, and doo you sweare Me to hate but I forbeare? Curst be my destnies all, That brought mee so high to fall: Soone with my death Ile please thee. No no no no, my Deare let bee. The fifth Sonnet. [While favour fed my hope, delight with hope was brought] [1] While favour fed my hope, delight with hope was brought, Thought waited on delight, &amp; speach did folow thought. Then drew my tongue and pen records unto thy glorie; I thought all words were lost that were not spent of thee, I thought each place was darke but where thy lights would be, And all eares worse then deaffe, that hard not out thy storie. 2 I said thou wert most faire, and so indeed thou art; I said thou wert most sweete, sweete poyson to my hart; I said my soule was thine, Ã´ would I then had lied; I said thy eyes were starres, thy breasts the milken way, Thy fingers Cupids shafts, thy voyce the Angels lay: And all is said so well, that no man it denied. 3 But now that hope is lost, unkindnes kils delight, Yet thought and speach do live, thought metamorphisde quite, For rage now rules the reynes, which guided were by pleasure, I thinke now of thy faults, who late wrote of thy praise, That speech falls now to blame which did thy honour raise: The same key open can, which can locke up a treasure. 4 Then thou whom partiall heavens conspir'd in one to frame The proofe of beauties worke, the inheritance of fame, The mansion state of blisse, and just excuse of lovers: See now those feathers pluckt wherewith thou flewst most hie, See what cloudes of reproach shall darke thy honours skie; Whome fault once casteth downe, hardly high state recovers. 5 And Ã´ my Muse, though oft you luld her in your lap, And then a heavenly Childe gave her Ambrosian pap, And to that braine of hers your highest gifts infused; Since she disdaining me, doth you in me disdaine, Suffer not her to laugh, and both we suffer paine: Princes in subjects wrongs must deeme themselves abused. 6 Your client poore, my selfe, shall Stella handle so, Revenge, revenge, my Muse defiance trumpet blowe, Threate, threat, what may be done; yet do no more but threaten: Ah, my sute granted is, I feele my breast doth swell; Now Childe, a lesson new you shall begin to spell, Sweet babes must babies have, but shrewd girles must be beaten. 7 Thinke now no more to heare of warme fine shining snow, Nor blushing Lillyes, nor pearles Rubie hidden row, Nor of that golden sea, whose waves in curles are broken: But of thy soule fraught with such ungratefulnesse, As where thou soone mightst help, most there thou dost oppresse Ungrateful who is cald, the worst of ills is spoken. 8 Yet worse then worse, I say thou art a Thiefe. A thiefe? Now God forbid: a thiefe, and of worst thieves a thiefe; Thieves steale for need, &amp; steale for goods, which pain recovers But thou, rich in all joyes, dost rob my goods from mee, Which cannot be restorde by time nor industrie: Of foes the spoyle is evill, farre more of constant lovers. 9 Yet gentle English thieves doo rob, and will not slay; Thou English murdring thiefe, wilt have hearts for thy pray. The name of murdrer now on thy faire forhead sitteth, And even while I do speake my death wounds bleeding bee, Which I protest proceed from onely cruell thee, Who may and will not save, murther in trueth committeth. 10 But murthers private fault seemes but a toy to thee. I lay then to thy charge unjustice Tirannie, If rule by force without all claime, a Tyrant sheweth; For thou art my hearts Lord, who am not borne thy slave, And which is worse makes me most guiltles torments have, A rightfull Prince by unrightfull deeds a Tyrant groweth. 11 Loe you grow proud with this, for Tyrants makes folk bow: Of foule rebellion then I do appeach thee now, Rebels by Natures lawes rebel by way of reason; Thou sweetest subject wert borne in the Realme of Love, And yet against thy Prince, thy force dost daily prove, No vertue merits praise, once toucht with blot of Treason. 12 But valiant Rebels oft in fooles mouths purchase fame, I now then staine thy white with blackest blot of shame, Both Rebel to the Sonne, and vagrant from the Mother; For wearing Venus badge, in every part of thee, Unto Dianaes traine thou runnaway didst flie: Who faileth one is false, though trustie to another. 13 What is not this enough, nay farre worse commeth here: A Witch I say thou art, though thou so faire appeare. For I protest, mine eyes never thy sight enjoyeth, But I in mee am chang'd, I am alive and dead. My feete are turn'd to rootes, my heart becommeth lead, No witchcraft is so ill, as which mans minde destroyeth, 14 Yet Witches may repent, thou art farre worse than they: Alas, that I am forst such evill of thee to say: I say thou art a Divel though cloathd in Angels shining: For thy face tempts my soule to leave the heavens for thee, And thy words of refuse doo powre even hell on mee: Who tempts, and tempted plagues are Divels in true defining. 15 You then ungrateful theefe, you murthering Tyrant you, You Rebel runnaway to Lord and Lady untrue, You witch, you Divel (alas) you still of me beloved, You see what I can say; mend yet your froward minde, And such skill in my Muse you reconcil'd shall finde, That by these cruell words your praises shalbe proved. The sixth Sonnet. [O you that heare this voice] [1] O you that heare this voice, O you that see this face, Say whether of the choice, Deserves the better place, Feare not to judge this bate, For it is voide of hate. 2 This side doth Beautie take, For that doth Musicke speake, Fit Orators to make, The strongest judgements weake, The barre to plead the right, Is onely true delight. 3 Thus doth the voice and face, The gentle Lawiers wage, Like loving brothers case, For Father's heritage, That each while each contends, It selfe to other lends. 4 For Beautie beautifies With heavenly view and grace, The heavenly harmonies; And in this faultles face The perfect beauties bee, A perfect harmonie. 5 Musicke more lustie swels In speeches noblie placed, Beautie as farre excels In actions aptly graced. A friend each partie drawes, To countenance his cause. 6 Love more affected seemes To Beauties lovely light, And Wonder more esteemes Of Musicks wondrous might; But both to both so bent, As both in both are spent. 7 Musicke doth witnes call The eare, his truth to trie: Beauty brings to the hall The judgement of the eie: Both in their objects such, As no exceptions tuch. 8 The common Sense which might Be arbitrer of this, To be forsooth upright, To both sides partiall is: He laies on this chiefe praise, Chiefe praise on that he laies. 9 Then reason Princesse hie, Whose throne is in the minde; Which Musicke can in skie, And hidden Beauties finde: Say, whether thou wilt crowne With limitlesse renowne. The seventh Sonnet. [Whose senses in so evill comfort their stepdame Nature laies] [1] Whose senses in so evill comfort their stepdame Nature laies, That ravishing delight in them most sweete tunes doth not raise, Or if they doe delight therein yet are so cloid with wit, As with sententious lips to set a little vaine on it: O let them hear these sacred tunes, &amp; learn in wonders scholes, To be (in things past bo?ds of wit) fooles, if they be not fooles. [2] Who have so leaden eyes, as not to see sweete Beauties showe: Or seeing, have so wooden wits as not that worth to knowe; Or knowing, have so muddie mindes, as not to be in love; Or loving, have so frothie hearts, as easie thence to move: O, let them see these heavenly beames, and in faire letters reed A lesson, fit both sight and skill, Love &amp; firme Love to breed. 3 Hear then, but then with wonder hear; see, but admiring see; No mortal gifts, no earthly frutes now here discerned bee: See, doo you see this face: a face, nay image of the skyes, Of which, the two life-giving lights are figured in her eyes: Heare you this soule-invading voyce, &amp; count it but a voyce, The verie essence of their tunes, when Angels doo rejoyce. The eighth. [In a grove most rich of shade] [1] In a grove most rich of shade; Where birds wanton Musicke made: Maie then young his pide weeds shewing, New perfumes with flowrs fresh growing. 2 Astrophel with Stella sweete, Did for mutual comfort meete: Both within themselves oppressed, But either in each other blessed. 3 Him great harmes had taught much care, Her faire necke a foule yoke bare: But hir sight his cares did banish, In his sight hir yoke did vanish. 4 Wept they had, alas the while: But now teares themselves did smile, While their eyes by Love directed, Interchangeablie reflected. 5 Sighd they had: but now betwixt Sighs of woe were glad sighs mixt: With armes crost, yet testifying Restles rest, and living dying. 6 Their eares hungrie of each word Which the deare tongue would afford, But their tongues restraind from walking, Till their harts had ended talking. 7 But when their tongues could not speak, Love it selfe did silence breake: Love did set his lips asunder, Thus to speake in love and wonder. 8 Stella, Sovereigne of my joy, Fair Triumphres in annoy: Stella, Starre of heavenly fire, Stella, loadstarre of desire. 9 Stella, in whose shining eyes Are the lights of Cupids skyes, Whose beames where they are once darted Love therewith is straight imparted. 10 Stella, whose voyce when it speakes, Senses all asunder breakes: Stella, whose voyce when it singeth, Angels to acquaintance bringeth. 11 Stella, in whose bodie is Writ the caracters of blis: Whose sweete face all beauty passeth, Save the minde which it surpasseth. 12 Graunt, Ã´ graunt, but speach (alas) Failes me, fearing on to passe: Graunt to me, what am I saying? But no sinne there is in praying. 13 Graunt (Ã´ Deare) on knees I pray (Knees on ground he then did stay) That not I, but since I prove you, Time and place for me nere move you. 14 Never season was more fit, Never roome more apt for it: Smiling aire allowes my reason: These birds sing; now use the season. 15 This small winde which so sweete is, See how it the leaves doth kis; Each tree in his best attyring, Sense of Love to Love inspiring. 16 Love makes earth the water drinke, Love to earth makes water sinke: And if dumb things be so wittie, Shall a heavenly Grace want pittie? 17 There his hands (in their speach) faine Would have made tongues language plaine: But her hands his hands compelling, Gave repulse, all grace expelling. 18 Therewithall, away she went, Leaving him with passion rent, With what she had done and spoken, That therewith my song is broken. The ninth Sonnet. [Goe my Flocke, goe get you hence] [1] Goe my Flocke, goe get you hence, Seeke a better place of feeding, Where you may have some defence From the stormes in my breast bleeding, And showers from mine eyes proceeding. 2 Leave a wretch in whom all woe, Can abide to keepe no measure; Merrie Flocke, such one forgoe Unto whom mirth is displeasure, Onely rich in measures treasure. 3 Yet alas before you goe, Heare your wofull Masters storie, Which to stones I else would showe; Sorrow onely then hath glorie, When tis excellently sorie. 4 Stella, fairest Shepheardesse, Fairest, but yet cruelst ever; Stella, whom the heavens still blesse, Though against me she persever, Though I blisse inherit never. 5 Stella hath refused mee, Stella, who more love hath proved In this caitiffe hart to bee, Than can in good to us be moved Towards Lambkins best beloved, 6 Stella hath refused mee Astrophel that so well served. In this pleasant Spring (Muse) see, While in pride flowers be preserved, Himselfe onely, winter starved. 7 Why (alas) then doth she sweare That she loveth me so deerly; Seeing me so long to beare Coales of love that burne so cleerly: And yet leave me hopelesse meerly. 8 Is that love? forsooth I trow, If I saw my good dogg grieved, And a helpe for him did know, My love should not be beleeved, But he were by me releeved. 9 No, she hates me (welaway) Faining love, somewhat to please me; Knowing, if she should display All her hate, death soone would seaze me, And of hideous torments ease me. 10 Then my deare Flocke now adieu: But alas, if in your straying Heavenly Stella meete with you Tell her in your piteous blaying, Her poore Slaves just decaying. The tenth Sonnet. [O deere Life, when shall it bee] [1] O deere Life, when shall it bee, That mine eyes thine eyes shall see, And in them thy minde discover, Whether absense have had force Thy remembrance to divorce From the image of thy Lover? 2 O if I my selfe finde not By thine absence oft forgot, Nor debard from Beauties treasure, Let no tongue aspire to tell In what high joyes I shall dwell, Onely thought aimes at the pleasure. 3 Thought therefore will I send thee To take up the place for mee, Long I will not after tarrie: There unseene, thou maist be bold Those faire wonders to behold, Which in them my hopes doo carrie. 4 Thought, see thou no place forbeare, Enter bravely everie where, Seaze on all to her belonging: But if thou wouldst garded bee, Fearing her beames, take with thee Strength of liking, rage of longing. 5 O my Thoughts, my Thoughts surcease, Your delights my woes encrease, My life fleetes with too much thinking: Thinke no more, but die in mee, Till thou shalt received bee, At her lips my Nectar drinking. Finis Syr P. S. SONNET XXXVII. [My mouth doth water, and my breast doth swell] [First published in the Folio of 1598.] My mouth doth water, and my breast doth swell, My tongue doth itch, my thoughts in labour be: Listen then Lordings with good eare to me, For of my life I must a riddle tell. Toward Auroras Court a Nymph doth dwell, Rich in all beauties which mans eye can see: Beauties so farre from reach of words, that we Abase her praise, saying she doth excell: Rich in the treasure of deserv'd renowne, Rich in the riches of a royall hart, Rich in those gifts which give th'eternall crowne; Who though most rich in these and everie part, Which make the patents of true worldly blisse, Hath no misfortune, but that Rich she is. ELEVENTH SONG. [Who is it that this darke night] [First published in the Folio of 1598.] Who is it that this darke night, Underneath my window playneth? It is one who from thy sight, Being (ah) exild, disdayneth Every other vulgar light. Why alas, and are you he? Be not yet those fancies changed? Deere when you find change in me, Though from me you be estranged, Let my chaunge to ruine be. Well in absence this will dy, Leave to see, and leave to wonder: Absence sure will helpe, if I Can learne, how my selfe to sunder From what in my hart doth ly. But time will these thoughts remove: Time doth worke what no man knoweth, Time doth as the subject prove, With time still the affection groweth In the faithfull Turtle dove. What if you new beauties see, Will not they stir new affection? I will thinke thy pictures be, (Image like of Saints perfection) Poorely counterfeting thee. But your reasons purest light, Bids you leave such minds to nourish? Deere, do reason no such spite, Never doth thy beauty florish More, then in my reasons sight. But the wrongs love beares, will make Love at length leave undertaking; No the more fooles it do shake, In a ground of so firme making, Deeper still they drive the stake. Peace, I thinke that some give eare: Come no more, least I get anger. Blisse, I will my blisse forbeare, Fearing (sweete) you to endanger, But my soule shall harbour thee. Well, be gone, be gone I say, Lest that Argus eyes perceive you, O unjust fortunes sway, Which can make me thus to leave you, And from lowts to run away. CERTAINE SONETS WRITTEN BY SIR PHILIP SIDNEY: Never before printed. [First published in the Folio in 1598.] [Since shunning paine, I ease can never find] Since shunning paine, I ease can never find: Since bashfull dread seekes where he knowes me harmed: Since will is won, and stopped eares are charmed: Since force doth faint, and sight doth make me blind. Since loosing long, the faster still I bind: Since naked sence can conquer reason armed: Since heart in chilling feare with yce is warmed: In fine, since strife of thought but marres the mind, I yeeld, Ã´ Love, unto thy loathed yoke, Yet craving law of armes, whose rule doth teach, That hardly usde, who ever prison broke, In justice quit, of honour made no breach: Whereas if I a gratefull gardien have, Thou art my Lord, and I thy vowed slave. [When Love puft up with rage of hy disdaine] When Love puft up with rage of hy disdaine, Resolv'd to make me patterne of his might, Like foe, whose wits inclin'd to deadly spite, Would often kill to breed more feeling paine. He would not arm'd with beautie, only raigne On those affectes which easily yeeld to sight, But vertue sets so high, that reasons light, For all his strife can onlie bondage gaine. So that I live to pay a mortall fee, Dead palsie sicke of all my chiefest parts: Like those whom dreames make uglie monsters see, And can crie helpe with nought but grones and starts: Longing to have, having no wit to wish, To starving minds such is God Cupids dish. [The fire to see my wrongs for anger burneth] To the tune of Non credo gia che piu infelice amante. The fire to see my wrongs for anger burneth: The aire in raine for my affliction weepeth: The sea to ebbe for griefe his flowing turneth: The earth with pitie dull the center keepeth: Fame is with wonder blazed: Time runnes away for sorow: Place standeth still amazed To see my night of evils, which hath no morow. Alas, a lovely she no pitie taketh, To know my miseries, but chaste and cruell: My fall her glorie maketh, Yet still her eyes give to my flames their fuell. Fire burne me quite, till sense of burning leave me: Aire let me draw no more thy breath in anguish: Sea drownd in thee, of tedious life bereave me: Earth take this earth, wherein my spirits languish. Fame say I was not borne: Time haste my dying hower: Place see my grave uptorne: Fire, aire, sea, earth, fame, time, place, shew your power. Alas, from all their helpe I am exiled, For hers am I, and death feares her displeasure. Fie death, thou art beguiled, Though I be hers, she makes of me no treasure. [The Nightingale as soone as Aprill bringeth] To the same tune. The Nightingale as soone as Aprill bringeth Unto her rested sense a perfect waking, While late bare earth, proud of new clothing springeth, Sings out her woes, a thorne her song-booke making: And mournfully bewailing, Her throate in tunes expresseth What griefe her breast oppresseth, For Thereus force on her chaste will prevailing. O Philomela faire, Ã´ take some gladnesse, That here is juster cause of plaintfull sadnesse: Thine earth now springs, mine fadeth, Thy thorne without, my thorne my heart invadeth. Alas she hath no other cause of anguish But Thereus love, on her by strong hand wrokne, Wherein she suffring all her spirits languish, Full womanlike complaines her will was brokne. But I who dayly craving, Cannot have to content me, Have more cause to lament me, Since wanting is more woe then too much having. O Philomela faire, Ã´ take some gladnesse, That here is juster cause of plaintfull sadnesse: Thine earth now springs, mine fadeth: Thy thorne without, my thorne my heart invadeth. [Sleepe Babie mine, Desire nurse Beautie singeth] To the tune of Basciami vita mia. Sleepe Babie mine, Desire nurse Beautie singeth: Thy cries, Ã´ Babie, set mine head on aking: The Babe cries way, thy love doth keepe me waking. Lully, lully, my babe, hope cradle bringeth Unto my children alway good rest taking: The babe cries way, thy love doth keepe me waking. Since babie mine, from me thy watching springeth, Sleepe then a litle, pap content is making: The babe cries nay, for that abide I waking. [O faire, Ã´ sweet, when I do looke on thee] To the tune of the Spanish song, Se tu se?ora no dueles de mi. O faire, Ã´ sweet, when I do looke on thee, In Whom all joyes so well agree, Heart and soule do sing in me. This you heare is not my tongue, Which once said what I conceaved, For it was of use bereaved, With a cruell answer stong. No, though tongue to roofe be cleaved, Fearing least he chastisde be, Heart and soule do sing in me. O faire, O sweete, &amp;c. Just accord all musike makes; In thee just accord excelleth, Where each part in such peace dwelleth, One of other beautie takes. Since then truth to all minds telleth, That in thee lives harmonie, Heart and soule do sing in me. O faire, O sweet, &amp;c. They that heav'n have knowne, do say That who so that grace obtaineth, To see what faire sight there raigneth, Forced are to sing alway; So then since that heaven ramaineth, In thy face I plainly see, Heart and soule do sing in me. O faire, O sweete, &amp;c. Sweete thinke not I am at ease, For because my cheefe part singeth, This song from deathes sorrow springeth: As to Swanne in last disease: For no dumbnesse nor death bringeth Stay to true loves melody: Heart and soule do sing in me. [The scourge of life, and deaths extreame disgrace] These foure following Sonnets were made when his Ladie had paine in her face. The scourge of life, and deaths extreame disgrace, The smoke of hell, the monster called paine, Long sham'd to be accurst in every place, By them who of his rude resort complaine. Lyke crafty wretch by time and travell tought, His ugly evill in others good to hide, Late harbers in her face whom nature wrought, As treasure house where her best gifts do bide. And so by priviledge of sacred seate, A seate where beauty shines and vertue raignes, He hopes for some small praise since she hath great, Within her beames wrapping his cruell staines. Ah saucy paine let not thy errour last, More loving eyes she draws, more hate thou hast. Wo, wo, to me, on me returne the smart: My burning tongue hath bred my mistresse paine, For oft in paine to paine my painefull heart With her due praise did of my state complaine. I praisde her eyes whom never chance doth move, Her breath which makes a sower answer sweete, Her milken breasts the nurse of child-like love, Her legges (O legges) her ay well stepping feete. Paine heard her praise, and full of inward fire, (First sealing up my heart as pray of his) He flies to her, and boldned with desire, Her face (this ages praise) the thiefe doth kisse. O paine I now recant the praise I gave, And sweare she is not worthy thee to have. Thou paine the onely guest of loath'd constraint, The child of curse, mans weaknesse foster-child, Brother to woe, and father of complaint: Thou paine, thou hated paine, from heav'n exilde, How holdst thou her, whose eyes constraint doth feare, Whom curst do blesse, whose weakenesse vertues arme, Who others woes and plaints can chastly beare: In whose sweete heav'n Angels of high thoughts swarme. What courage strange hath caught thy caitife hart, Fear'st not a face that oft whole harts devowres, Or art thou from above bid play this part, And so no helpe gainst envy of those powers? If thus alas: yet while those partes have wo, So stay her toung, that she no more say no. And have I heard her say? Ã´ cruell paine! And doth she know what mould her beautie beares? Mournes she in truth, and thinks that others faine? Feares she to feele, and feeles not others feares? Or doth she thinke all paine the minde forbeares? That heavie earth, not fierie sprites may plaine? That eyes weepe worse then hart in bloodie teares? That sense feeles more then what doth sense containe? No, no, she is too wise, she knowes her face Hath not such paine as it makes others have: She knows the sicknesse of that perfect place Hath yet such health, as it my life can save. But this she thinks, our paine hye cause excuseth, Where her who should rule paine, false paine abuseth. [You better sure shall live, not evermore] Translated out of Horace, which beginnes Rectius vives. You better sure shall live, not evermore Trying high seas, nor while seas rage you flee, Pressing too much upon ill harbourd shore. The golden meane who loves, lives safely free From filth of foreworne house, and quiet lives, Releast from Court, where envie needes must be. The windes most oft the hugest Pine-tree greeves: The stately towers come downe with greater fall: The highest hills the bolt of thunder cleeves: Evill happes do fill with hope, good happes appall With feare of change, the courage well preparde: Fowle Winters as they come, away they shall. Though present times and past with evils be snarde, They shall not last: with Citherne silent muse, Apollo wakes, and bow hath sometime sparde. In hard estate with stowt shew valor use, The same man still in whom wise doome prevailes, In too full winde draw in thy swelling sailes. [Unto no body my woman saith she had rather a wife be] Out of Catullus. Unto no body my woman saith she had rather a wife be, Then to my selfe, not though Jove grew a suter of hers. These be her words, but a womans words to a love that is eager, In wind or waters streame do require to be writ. [Faire seeke not to be feard, most lovely beloved by thy servants] Faire seeke not to be feard, most lovely beloved by thy servants, For true it is, that they feare many whom many feare. [Like as the Dove which seeled up doth flie] Like as the Dove which seeled up doth flie, Is neither freed, nor yet to service bound, But hopes to gaine some helpe by mounting hie, Till want of force do force her fall to ground. Right so my minde caught by his guiding eye, And thence cast off, where his sweete hurt he found, Hath never leave to live, nor doome to dye, Nor held in evill, nor suffered to be sound. But with his wings of fancies up he goes, To hie conceits whose fruits are oft but small, Till wounded, blind, and wearied spirite, lose Both force to flie and knowledge where to fall. O happie Dove if she no bondage tried: More happie I, might I in bondage bide. E. D. Prometheus when first from heaven hie, He brought downe fire, ere then on earth not seene, Fond of Delight, a Satyre standing by, Gave it a kisse, as it like sweete had beene. Feeling forthwith the other burning power, Wood with the smart with showts and shryking shrill, He sought his ease in river, field, and bower, But for the time his griefe went with him still. So silly I with that unwonted sight In humane shape an Angell from above, Feeding mine eyes, the impression there did light, That since I runne and rest as pleaseth love, The difference is, the Satires lippes, my hart, He for a while I evermore have smart. A Satyre once did runne away for dread, With sound of horne, which he himselfe did blow, Fearing and feared thus from himselfe he fled, Deeming strange evill in that he did not know. Such causelesse feares when coward minds do take, It makes them flie that which they faine would have: As this poore beast who did his rest forsake, Thinking not why, but how himselfe to save. Even thus might I for doubts which I conceave Of mine owne wordes, my owne good hap betray, And thus might I for feare of may be, leave The sweete pursute of my desired pray. Better like I thy Satyre deerest Dyer, Who burnt his lips to kisse faire shining fire. [My mistresse lowers and saith I do not love] My mistresse lowers and saith I do not love: I do protest and seeke with service due, In humble mind a constant faith to prove, But for all this I can not her remove From deepe vaine thought that I may not be true. If othes might serve, even by the Stygian lake, Which Poets say, the gods them selves do feare, I never did my vowed word forsake: For why should I, whom free choise slave doth make? Else what in face, then in my fancie beare. My Muse therefore for onely thou canst tell, Tell me the cause of this my causelesse woe, Tell how ill thought disgrac'd my doing well: Tell how my joyes and hopes thus fowly fell To so lowe ebbe that wonted were to flowe. O this it is, the knotted straw is found In tender harts, small things engender hate: A horses worth laid wast the Troyan ground: A three foote stoole in Greece, made Trumpets sound, An Asses shade ere now hath bred debate. If Greekes themselves were mov'd with so small cause, To twist those broyles, which hardly would untwine: Should Ladies faire be tyed to such hard lawes, As in their moodes to take a lingring pawse? I would it not, their mettall is too fine. My hand doth not beare witnesse with my hart, She saith, because I make no wofull laies, To paint my living death, and endlesse smart: And so for one that felt god Cupids dart, She thinks I leade and live too merrie daies. Are Poets then the onely lovers true? Whose hearts are set on measuring a verse: Who thinke themselves well blest, if they renew Some good old dumpe, that Chaucers mistresse knew, And use but you for matters to rehearse. Then good Apollo do away thy bowe: Take harp and sing in this our versing time: And in my braine some sacred humour flowe: That all the earth my woes, sighes, teares may know, And see you not that I fall now to ryme. As for my mirth, how could I but be glad, Whilst that me thought I justly made my bost That onely I the onely Mistresse had: But now, if ere my face with joy be clad: Thinke Hanniball did laugh when Carthage lost. Sweet Ladie, as for those whose sullen cheare, Compar'd to me, made me in lightnesse found: Who Stoick-like in clowdie hew appeare: Who silence force to make their words more deare: Whose eyes seeme chaste, because they looke on ground: Beleeve them not for Phisicke true doth finde, Choler adust is joyed in woman-kinde. [In wonted walkes, since wonted fancies change] In wonted walkes, since wonted fancies change, Some cause there is, which of strange cause doth rise: For in each thing wherto mine eye doth range, Part of my paine me seemes engraved lyes. The Rockes which were of constant mind, the marke In clyming steepe, now hard refusall show: The shading woods seeme now my Sunne to darke, And stately hilles disdaine to looke so low. The restfull Caves now restlesse visions give, In Dales I see each way a hard assent: Like late mowne meades, late cut from joy I live. Alas sweete Brookes do in my teares augment: Rockes, woods, hilles, caves, dales, meads, brookes, answere me, Infected mindes infect each thing they see. [If I could thinke how these my thoughts to leave] If I could thinke how these my thoughts to leave, Or thinking still my thoughts might have good end: If rebell sence would reasons law receave; Or reason foyld would not in vaine contend: Then might I thinke what thoughts were best to thinke: Then might I wisely swimme or gladly sinke. If either you would change your cruell hart, Or cruell (still) time did your beautie staine: If from my soule this love would once depart, Or for my love some love I might obtaine, Then might I hope a change or ease of minde, By your good helpe, or in my selfe to finde. But since my thoughts in thinking still are spent, With reasons strife, by senses overthrowne, You fairer still, and still more cruell bent, I loving still a love that loveth none. I yeeld and strive, I kisse and curse the paine: Thought, reason, sense, time, you, and I, maintaine. A Farewell. Oft have I musde, but now at length I finde, Why those that die, men say they do depart: Depart, a word so gentle to my minde, Weakely did seeme to paint deaths ougly dart. But now the starres with their strange course do binde Me one to leave, with whome I leave my hart. I heare a crye of spirits faint and blinde, That parting thus my chiefest part I part. Part of my life, the loathed part to me, Lives to impart my wearie clay some breath. But that good part, wherein all comforts be, Now dead, doth shew departure is a death, Yea worse then death, death parts both woe and joy, From joy I part still living in annoy. [Finding those beames, which I must ever love] Finding those beames, which I must ever love, To marre my minde, and with my hurt to please, I deemd it best some absence for to prove, If further place might further me to ease. My eyes thence drawne, where lived all their light, Blinded forthwith in darke dispaire did lye, Like to the Molde with want of guiding sight, Deepe plunged in earth, deprived of the skie. In absence blind, and wearied with that woe, To greater woes by presence I returne, Even as the flye, which to the flame doth goe, Pleased with the light, that his small corse doth burne: Faire choice I have, either to live or dye A blinded Molde, or else a burned flye. The 7. Wonders of England. Neere Wilton sweete, huge heapes of stones are found, But so confusde, that neither any eye Can count them just, nor reason reason trye, What force brought them to so unlikely ground. To stranger weights my mindes waste soile is bound, Of passion hilles reaching to reasons skie, From fancies earth passing all numbers bound, Passing all ghesse, whence into me should fly So mazde a masse, or if in me it growes, A simple soule should breed so mixed woes. The Bruertons have a Lake, which when the Sunne, Approching warmes (not else) dead logges up sends, From hideous depth, which tribute when it ends, Sore signe it is, the Lords last thred is spun. My lake is sense, whose still streames never runne, But when my Sunne her shining twinnes there bends, Then from his depth with force in her begunne, Long drowned hopes to watrie eyes it lends: But when that failes, my dead hopes up to take, Their master is faire warn'd his will to make. We have a fish, by strangers much admirde, Which caught, to cruell search yeelds his chiefe part: (With gall cut out) closde up againe by art, Yet lives untill his life be new requirde. A stranger fish, my selfe not yet expirde, Though rapt with beauties hooke, I did impart My selfe unto th'Anatomy desirde, In steed of gall, leaving to her my hart: Yet live with thoughts closde up, till that she will By conquests right in steed of searching kill. Peake hath a Cave, whose narrow entries finde, Large roomes within, where droppes distill amaine: Till knit with cold, though there unknowne remaine, Decke that poore place with Alablaster linde. Mine eyes the streight, the roomie cave, my minde, Whose clowdie thoughts, let fall an inward raine Of sorrowes droppes till colder reason binde Their running fall into a constant vaine Of trueth, farre more then Alablaster pure, Which though despisde, yet still doth truth endure. A field there is, where if a stake be prest, Deepe in the earth, what hath in earth receipt, Is chang'd to stone, in hardnesse, cold, and weight, The wood, above doth soone consuming rest. The earth, her eares: the stake is my request: Of which, how much may pierce to that sweet seate, To honor turnd, doth dwell in honors nest, Keeping that forme, though void of wonted heate: But all the rest, which feare durst not applie, Failing themselves, with withered conscience dye. Of ships, by shipwrack cast on Albion coast, Which rotting on the rockes, their death do dye: From wodden bones, and bloud of pitch doth flie A bird which gets more life then ship had lost. My ship, desire, with winde of lust long tost, Brake on faire cleeves of constant chastitie: Where plagu'd for rash attempt, gives up his ghost, So deepe in seas of vertue beauties ly. But of this death flies up a purest love, Which seeming lesse, yet nobler life doth move. These wonders England breedes, the last remaines, A Ladie in despite of nature chaste. On whome all love, in whom no love is plaste, Where fairenesse yeelds to wisdomes shortest raines. An humble pride, a skorne that favour staines: A womans mould, but like an Angell graste, An Angells mind, but in a woman caste: A heaven on earth, or earth that heaven containes: Now thus this wonder to myselfe I frame, She is the cause that all the rest I am. [Who hath his fancie pleased] To the tune of Wilhemus van Nassaw, &amp;c. Who hath his fancie pleased, With fruits of happie sight, Let here his eyes be raised On natures sweetest light. A light which doth dissever, And yet unite the eyes, A light which dying never, Is cause the looker dyes. She never dies but lasteth In life of lovers hart, He ever dies that wasteth In love, his chiefest part. Thus is her life still guarded, In never dying faith: Thus is his death rewarded, Since she lives in his death. Looke then and dye, the pleasure Doth answere well the paine: Small losse of mortall treasure, Who may immortall gaine. Immortall be her graces, Immortall is her minde: They fit for heavenly places, This heaven in it doth binde. But eyes these beauties see not, Nor sence that grace descryes: Yet eyes deprived be not, From sight of her faire eyes: Which as of inward glorie They are the outward seale: So may they live still sorie Which die not in that weale. But who hath fancies pleased, With fruits of happie sight, Let here his eyes be raysed On natures sweetest light. The smokes of Melancholy. Who hath ever felt the change of love, And knowne those pangs that the loosers prove, May paint my face without seeing mee, And write the state how my fancies bee, The lothsome buds growne on sorrowes tree. But who by hearesay speakes, and hath not fully felt What kind of fires they be in which those spirits melt, Shall gesse, and faile, what doth displease, Feeling my pulse, misse my disease. O no, O no, tryall onely shewse The bitter juice of forsaken woes, Where former blisse present evils do staine, Nay former blisse addes to present paine, While remembrance doth both states containe. Come learners then to me, the modell of mishappe, Engulfed in despaire, slid downe from fortunes lappe: And as you like my double lot, Tread in my steppes, or follow not. For me alas I am full resolv'd, Those bands alas shall not be dissolv'd, Nor breake my word though reward come late, Nor faile my faith in my failing fate, Nor change in change, though change change my state. But alwayes one my selfe with eagle eyde trueth to flie, Up to the sunne, although the sunne my wings do frie: For if those flames burne my desire, Yet shall I die in PhÃ¦nix fire. [When to my deadlie pleasure] When to my deadlie pleasure, When to my livelie torment, Ladie mine eyes remained, Joyned alas to your beames. With violence of heav'nly Beautie tied, to vertue, Reason abasht retyred, Gladly my senses yeelded. Gladly my senses yeelding, Thus to betray my harts fort, Left me devoid of all life. They to the beamie Sunnes went, Where by the death of all deaths, Finde to what harme they hastned. Like to the silly Sylvan, Burn'd by the light he best liked, When with a fire he first met. Yet, yet, a life to their death, Lady you have reserved, Lady the life of all love. For though my sense be from me, And I be dead who want sense, Yet do we both live in you. Turned anew by your meanes, Unto the flowre that ay turnes, As you, alas, my Sunne bends. Thus do I fall to rise thus, Thus do I dye to live thus, Changed to a change, I change not. Thus may I not be from you: Thus be my senses on you: Thus what I thinke is of you: Thus what I seeke is in you: All what I am, it is you. [No, no, no, no, I cannot hate my foe] To the tune of a Neapolitan song, which beginneth: No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, I cannot hate my foe, Although with cruell fire, First throwne on my desire, She sackes my rendred sprite. For so a faire, a flame embraces All the places, Where that heat of all heates springeth, That it bringeth To my dying heart some pleasure, Since his treasure Burneth bright in fairest light. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, I cannot hate my foe, Although, &amp;c. Since our lives be not immortall, But to mortall Fetters tyed, do waite the hower Of deathes power. They have no cause to be sorie, Who with glorie End the way, where all men stay. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, I cannot hate my foe, Although, &amp;c. No man doubts, whom beautie killeth, Faire death feeleth, And in whome faire death proceedeth, Glorie breedeth: So that I in her beames dying, Glorie trying, Though in paine, cannot complaine. No, no, no, no. [Al my sense thy sweetnesse gained] To the tune of a Neapolitan Villanell. Al my sense thy sweetnesse gained, Thy faire haire my heart enchained, My poore reason thy words moved, So that thee like heaven I loved. Fa la la leridan, dan dan dan deridan: Dan dan dan deridan deridan dei: While to my minde the out side stood, For messenger of inward good. Now thy sweetnesse sowre is deemed, Thy haire not worth a haire esteemed: Reason hath thy words removed, Finding that but words they proved. Fa la la leridan dan dan dan deridan, Dan dan dan deridan deridan dei, For no faire signe can credit winne, If that the substance faile within. No more in thy sweetnesse glorie, For thy knitting haire be sorie: Use thy words but to bewaile thee, That no more thy beames availe thee. Dan, dan, Dan, dan, Lay not thy colours more to view, Without the picture be found true. Wo to me, alas she weepeth! Foole in me, what follie creepeth, Was I to blaspheme enraged, Where my soule I have engaged. Dan, dan, Dan, dan, And wretched I must yeeld to this, The fault I blame her chastnesse is. Sweetnesse sweetly pardon folly, Ty me haire your captive holly, Words, Ã´ words of heavenlie knowledge, Know my words their faults acknowledge. Dan, dan, Dan, dan. And all my life I will confesse, The lesse I love, I live the lesse. [What changes here, Ã´ haire] Translated out of the Diana of Montemaior in Spanish. Where Sireno a shepheard pulling out a litle of his Mistresse Dianas haire, wrapt about with greene silke, who now had utterlie forsaken him: to the haire he thus bewaild himselfe. What changes here, Ã´ haire, I see since I saw you: How ill fits you this greene to weare, For hope the colour due. Indeed I well did hope, Though hope were mixt with feare, No other shepheard should have scope, Once to approch this heare. Ah haire, how many dayes, My Diane made me shew, With thousand prety childish plaies, If I ware you or no, Alas how oft with teares, O teares of guilefull breast, She seemed full of jealous feares, Whereat I did but jeast. Tell me Ã´ haire of gold, If I then faultie be, That trust those killing eyes, I would, Since they did warrant me. Have you not seene her mood, What streames of teares she spent, Till that I sware my faith so stood, As her words had it bent? Who hath such beautie seene In one that changeth so? Or where ones love so constant bene? Who ever saw such woe? Ah haire are you not griev'd, To come from whence you be, Seeing how once you saw I liv'd, To see me as you see? On sandie banke of late, I saw this woman sit, Where sooner die then change my state, She with her finger writ: Thus my beleefe was staid, Behold Loves mightie hand On things, were by a woman said, And written in the sand. [Of this high grace with blisse conjoyn'd] The same Sireno in Montemaior holding his mistresse glasse before her, looking upon her while she viewed her selfe, thus sang: Of this high grace with blisse conjoyn'd No further debt on me is laid, Since that in selfe same mettall coin'd, Sweet Ladie you remaine well paid. For if my place give me great pleasure, Having before me Natures treasure, In face and eyes unmatched being, You have the same in my hands seeing, What in your face mine eyes do measure. Nor thinke the match unev'nly made, That of those beames in you do tarie: The glasse to you but gives a shade, To me mine eyes the true shape carie. For such a thought most highlie prized, Which ever hath Loves yoke despised: Better then one captiv'd perceiveth, Though he the lively forme receiveth: The other sees it but disguised. [Ring out your belles, let mourning shewes be spread] Ring out your belles, let mourning shewes be spread, For love is dead: All Love is dead, infected With plague of deepe disdaine: Worth as nought worth rejected, And Faith faire scorne doth gaine. From so ungratefull fancie, From such a femall franzie, From them that use men thus, Good Lord deliver us. Weepe neighbours, weepe, do you not heare it said, That Love is dead: His death-bed peacocks follie, His winding sheete is shame, His will false-seeming holie, His sole exectour blame. From so ungratefull, &amp;c. Let Dirge be sung, and Trentals rightly read, For Love is dead: Sir wrong his tombe ordaineth: My mistresse Marble-heart, Which Epitaph containeth, Her eyes were once his dart. From so ungratefull, &amp;c. Alas, I lie: rage hath this errour bred, Love is not dead. Love is not dead, but sleepeth In her unmatched mind: Where she his counsell keepeth, Till due desert she find. Therefore from so vile fancie, To call such wit a franzie, Who love can temper thus, Good Lord deliver us. [Thou blind mans marke, thou fooles selfe chosen snare] Thou blind mans marke, thou fooles selfe chosen snare, Fond fancies scum, and dregs of scattred thought, Band of all evils, cradle of causelesse care, Thou web of will, whose end is never wrought. Desire, desire I have too dearely bought, With prise of mangled mind thy worthlesse ware, Too long, too long asleepe thou hast me brought, Who should my mind to higher things prepare. But yet in vaine thou hast my ruine sought, In vaine thou madest me to vaine things aspire, In vaine thou kindlest all thy smokie fire. For vertue hath this better lesson taught, Within my selfe to seeke my onelie hire: Desiring nought but how to kill desire. [Leave me Ã´ Love, which reachest but to dust] Leave me Ã´ Love, which reachest but to dust, And thou my mind aspire to higher things: Grow rich in that which never taketh rust: What ever fades, but fading pleasure brings. Draw in thy beames, and humble all thy might, To that sweet yoke, where lasting freedomes be: Which breakes the clowdes and opens forth the light. That doth both shine and give us sight to see. O take fast hold, let that light be thy guide, In this small course which birth drawes out to death, And thinke how evill becommeth him to slide, Who seeketh heav'n, and comes of heav'nly breath. Then farewell world, thy uttermost I see, Eternall Love maintaine thy life in me. Splendidis longum valedico nugis. A DIALOGUE BETWEENE TWO SHEPHERDS, utterd in a pastorall shew, at Wilton. [First published in the Folio of 1613.] Will. Dick, since we cannot dance, come let a chearefull voyce Shew that we do not grudge at all when others do rejoyce. Dick. Ah Will, though I grudge not, I count it feeble glee With sight made dymme with dayly teares anothers sport to see. Who ever Lambkins saw (yet lambkins love to play) To play when that their loved dammes, are stoln or gone astray? If this in them be true, as true in men think I A lustles song for sooth thinks hee that hath more lust to cry. Will. A tyme there is for all, my Mother often sayes, When she with skirts tuckt very hy, with girles at stoolball playes. When thou hast mynd to weepe, seeke out som smoky room: Now let those lightsomme sights we see thy darknes overcome. Dick. What joy the joyfull sunne gives unto bleared eyes: That comfort in these sports you like, my mynde his comfort tryes. Will. What? is thy Bagpipe broke, or are thy lambs miswent; Thy wallet or thy Tarbox lost, or thy new rayment rent? Dick. I would it were but thus, for thus it were too well. Will. Thou seest my eares do itch at it: good Dick thy sorow tell. Dick. Here then and learne to sigh: a mistress I doo serve, Whose wages makes me beg the more, who feeds me till I sterve, Whose lyverie is such, as most I freeze apparelled most, And lookes so neere unto my cure that I must needes be lost. Will. What? these are riddles sure, art thou then bound to her? Dick. Bound as I neither power have, nor would have power to stir. W. Who bound thee? D. Love my Lord. W. What witnesses therto? Dick. Faith in my self and worth in her, which no proofe can undoo. W. What seale? D. my hart deepe graven. W. who made the band so fast? D. Wonder that by two so black eyes the glittring stars be past. Will. What keepeth safe thy band? D. Remembrance is the Chest Lockt fast with knowing that she is, of worldly things the best. Will. Thou late of wages playn'dst: what wages mayst thou have? D. Her heavenly looks, which more and more do give me cause to crave. W. If wages make you want, what food is that she gives? D. Teares drink, sorowes meat, wherewith, not I, but in me my death lives. Will. What living get you then? D. Disdayne; but just disdayne. So have I cause my selfe to plaine, but no cause to complayne. Will. What care takes shee for thee? D. Hir care is to prevent My freedom, with show of hir beames, with virtue my content. Will. God shield us from such Dames. If so our Downes be sped, The shepheards will grow leane I trow, their sheep will ill be fed. But Dick my counsell marke: run from the place of wo: The Arrow being shot from far, doth give the smaller blowe. Dick. Good Will, I cannot take thy good advice, before That Foxes leave to steale, because they finde they dy therefore. Will. Then Dick let us go hence lest wee great folkes annoy. For nothing can more tedious bee, then plaint, in time of joy. Dick. Oh hence! o cruell word! which even doggs do hate: But hence, even hence, I must needes goe; such is my dogged fate. TWO PASTORELS, MADE BY SIR PHILLIP SIDNEY. Upon his meeting with his two worthy Friends, and fellow Poets, Sir Edward Dier, and M. Fulke Grevill. [Joyne mates in mirth to me] Joyne mates in mirth to me, Grant pleasure to our meeting: Let Pan our good God see, How gratefull is our greeting. Joyne hearts and hands, so let it be, Make but one minde in bodies three. Ye Hymnes and singing skill Of God Apolloes giving, Be prest our reeds to fill, With sound of musicke living. Joyne hearts and hands, &amp;c. Sweet Orpheus Harpe, whose sound The stedfast mountaines moved, Let here thy skill abound, To joyne sweete friends beloved. Joyne hearts and hands, &amp;c. My two and I be met, A happy blessed Trinitie, As three most joyntly set, In firmest band of unity. Joyne hands, &amp;c. Welcome my two to me, E.D. F.G. P.S. The number best beloved, Within my heart you be In friendship unremooved. Joyne hands, &amp;c. Give leave your flocks to range, Let us the while be playing, Within the Elmy grange, Your flockes will not be straying. Joyne hands, &amp;c. Cause all the mirth you can, Since I am now come hether, Who never joy but when I am with you together. Joyne hands, &amp;c. Like lovers doe their love, So joy I, in you seeing: Let nothing me remove From alwaies with you being. Joyne hands, &amp;c. And as the turtle Dove To mate with whom he liveth, Such comfort, fervent love Of you to my heart giveth. Joyne hands, &amp;c. Now joyned be our hands, Let them be ne're asunder, But linkt in binding bands By metamorphoz'd wonder. So should our severed bodies three As one for ever joyned be. Sir Ph. Sidney. Dispraise of a Courtly life. Walking in bright Phoebus blaze, Where with heate opprest I was, I got to a shady wood, Where greene leaves did newly bud And of grasse was plenty dwelling, Deckt with pide flowers sweetly smelling. In this wood a man I met, On lamenting wholy set: Ruing change of wonted state, Whence he was transformed late, Once to Shepheards God retaining, Now in servile Court remaining. There he wandring malcontent, Up and downe perplexed went, Daring not to tell to me, Spake unto a senselesse tree, One amongst the rest electing These same words, or this effecting. My old mates I grieve to see, Voyde of me in field to be, Where we once our lovely sheepe, Lovingly like friends did keepe, Oft each others friendship proving, Never striving, but in loving. But may Love abiding be In poore shepheards base degree? It belongs to such alone To whom art of Love is knowne: Seely shepheards are not witting What in art of Love is fitting. Nay what need the art to those, To whom we our love disclose? It is to be used then, When we doe but flatter men: Friendship true in heart assured, Is by natures gifts procured. Therefore shepheards wanting skil, Can Loves duties best fulfill, Since they know not how to faine, Nor with Love to cloake Disdaine: Like the wiser sort, whose learning Hides their inward will of harming. Well was I, while under shade Oaten Reeds me musick made, Striving with my mates in Song: Mixing mirth our Songs among, Greater was the shepheards treasure, Then this false, fine, courtly pleasure. Where, how many Creatures be, So many puft in mind I see, Like to Junoes birds of pride, Scarce each other can abide: Friends like to black Swans apearing Sooner these than those in hearing. Therefore Pan, if thou mayest be, Made to listen unto me, Grant I say (if seely man May make treaty to God Pan) That I, without thy denying, May be still to thee relying. Only for my two loves sake, Sir Ed. D. &amp; M.F.G. In whose love I pleasure take, Onely two do me delight With their ever pleasing sight, Of all men to thee retaining. Grant me with those two remaining. So shall I to thee alwaies, With my reeds sound mighty praise, And first Lambe that shall befall, Yearely decke thine Altar shall, If it please thee to be reflected, And I from thee not rejected. So I left him in that place, Taking pittie on his case, Learning this among the rest That the meane estate is best, Better filled with contenting Void of wishing and repenting. Sir Ph. Sidney. [THE LADY OF MAY] SUPPLICATION. Most gracious Soveraigne, To one whose state is raised over all, Whose face doth oft the bravest sort enchaunt, Whose mind is such, as wisest minds appall, Who in one selfe these diverse gifts can plant; How dare I wretch seeke there my woes to rest, Where eares be burnt, eyes dazled, harts opprest? Your state is great, your greatnesse is our shield, Your face hurts oft, but still it doth delight, Your mind is wise, your wisedome makes you mild, Such planted gifts enrich even beggers sight: So dare I wretch, my bashfull feare subdue, And feede mine eares, mine eyes, my hart in you. [Come Espilus, come now declare thy skill] Therion. Come Espilus, come now declare thy skill, Shew how thou canst deserve so brave desire, Warme well thy wits, if thou wilt win her will, For water cold did never promise fire: Great sure is she, on whom our hopes do live, Greater is she who must the judgement give. Espilus. Tune up my voice, a higher note I yeeld, To high conceipts the song must needes be high, More high then stars, more firme then flintie field Are all my thoughts, on which I live or die: Sweete soule, to whom I vowed am a slave, Let not wild woods so great a treasure have. Therion. The highest note comes oft from basest mind, As shallow brookes do yeeld the greatest sound, Seeke other thoughts thy life or death to find; Thy stars be fal'n, plowed is thy flintie ground: Sweete soule let not a wretch that serveth sheepe, Among his flocke so sweete a treasure keepe. Espilus. Two thousand sheepe I have as white as milke, Though not so white as is thy lovely face, The pasture rich, the wooll as soft as silke, All this I give, let me possesse thy grace, But still take heede least thou thy selfe submit To one that hath no wealth, and wants his wit. Therion. Two thousand deere is wildest woods I have, Them can I take, but you I cannot hold: He is not poore who can his freedome save, Bound but to you, no wealth but you I would: But take this beast, if beasts you feare to misse, For of his beasts the greatest beast he is. [Silvanus long in love, and long in vaine] Silvanus long in love, and long in vaine, At length obtaind the point of his desire, When being askt, now that he did obtaine His wished weale, what more he could require: Nothing sayd he, for most I joy in this, That Goddesse mine, my blessed being sees. When wanton Pan deceiv'd with Lions skin, Came to the bed, where wound for kisse he got, To wo and shame the wretch did enter in, Till this he tooke for comfort of his lot, Poore Pan (he sayd) although thou beaten be, It is no shame, since Hercules was he. Thus joyfully in chosen tunes rejoyce, That such a one is witnesse of my hart, Whose cleerest eyes I blisse, and sweetest voyce, That see my good, and judgeth my desert: Thus wofully I in wo this salve do find, My foule mishap came yet from fairest mind.

      <field name="fulltext">Volume III TRANSLATIONS. THE PSALMS OF DAVID. Psalm I. Beatus vir. He blessed is, who neither loosely treads The straying stepps as wicked counsel leades, Ne for bad mates in way of sinning wayteth, Nor yet himself with idle scorners seateth; But on Gods law his hearts delight doth bind, Which night &amp; day he calls to marking mind. He shall be like a freshly planted tree, To which sweet springs of waters neighbours be. Whose braunches faile not timely fruite to nourish, Nor with red leafe shall make yt faile to flourish. So all the things whereto that man doth bend, Shall prosper still, with well succeeding end. Such blessings shall not wicked wretches see: But lyke vyle chaff with wind shal scattred be; For neither shall the men in sin delighted Consist, when they to highest doome are cited. Ne yet shall suffred be a place to take, Where godly men do their assembly make. For God doth know, &amp; knowing doth approve The trade of them, that just proceeding love But they that sinne, in sinfull breast do cherish The way they go shall be their way to perish. Psalm II. Quare fremuerunt gentes. What ayles this heathenish rage? What do thes people meane To mutter murmures vaine? Why do these earthly kings &amp; lords such meeting make, And councel joyntly take, Against the Lord of Lords, the lord of every thing, And his anoynted king? Come, let us break their bonds, say they, &amp; fondly say: And cast their yoakes away. But he shall them deride, who by the heavns is borne, He shall laugh them to scorn, And after speake to them, with breath of wrathful fire, And vex them in his ire. And say (O kings) yet have I set my King upon My Holy Hill Syon; And I will (sayeth His king) the Lords decree display, And say that he did say: Thou art my Son indeed, this day begott by me: Ask I will give to thee, The Heathen for thy Childs right, &amp; will thy realme extend Farr as Worlds farthest end. With Iron scepter bruse thou shalt, &amp; peece meale breake These men like potshards weake. Therefore (O kings), be wise, O rulers rule your mind, That knowledg you may finde. Serve God, serve him with feare: Rejoyce in him but so, That joy with trembling go. With loving homage kisse that only son he hath, Least you enflame his wrath. Whereof if but a sparke once kindled be, you all From your way perish shall And then they that in him their only trust do rest, O they be rightly blest. Psalm III. Domine quid multiplic Lord how do they encrease That hatefull never cease To breed my grievous trouble How many Ones there be That all against poore me Their numbrous strength redouble. Even multitudes be they That to my Soul do say No help for you remaineth In God on whom you build Yet Lord thou art my shield In thee my glory raigneth. The Lord lifts up my head To him my voice I spread From Holy hill he heard me I layd me down &amp; slept While he me safely kept, And safe from sleep I reard me. I will not be afraid Though legions round be layd, Which all against me gather: I say no more but this: Up Lord now time it is: Help me my God &amp; Father! For thou with cruel blowes On jawbones of my foes, My causeless wrongs hast wroken: Thou those mens teeth which byte, Venom'd with godless spight, Hast in their malice broken. Salvation doth belong Unto the Lord most strong: He is he that defendeth: And on those blessed same Which beare his peoples name, His blessing he extendeth. Psalm IV. Cum invocarem. Heare me, O heare me, when I call, O God God of my equity: Thou sett'st me free when I was thrall, Have mercy therefore still on me, And harken how I pray to thee. O men, whose fathers were but men, Till when will ye my honor high Stain with your blasphemies? till when Such pleasure take in vanity, And only hunt where lies do ly? Yet know this to, that God did take When he chose me, a godly one: Such one, I say, that when I make My cryeng plaintes to him alone, He will give good eare to my moane. O tremble then with awfull will: Sinne from all rule in you depose, Talk with your harts and yet be still: And when your chamber you do close, Your selves, yet to your selves disclose. The sacrifices sacrifie Of just desires, on justice staid Trust in that Lord that cannot ly. Indeed full many folkes have said, From whence shall come to us such aid? But Lord lift thou upon our sight The shining cleerenes of thy face: Where I have found more hartes delight, Then they whose store in harvests space Of grain and wine fills stoaring place. So I in peace and peacefull blisse Will lay me down and take my rest: For it is thou Lord, thou it is, By pow'r of whose own onely brest I dwell, laid up in safest neast. Psalm V. Verba mea auribus. Ponder the wordes O Lord that I doe say, Consider what I meditate in me: O harken to my voice which calls on thee, My king, my God, for I to thee will pray. Soe shall my voice clime to thine eares betime: For unto thee I will my praier send With earliest entry of the morning prime, And will my waiting eies to thee-ward bend. For thou art that same God, farre from delight In that which of fowle wickednes doth smell: No, nor with thee the naughty ones shall dwell, Nor glorious fooles stand in thy awfull sight. Thou hatest all whose workes in ill are plac'd, And shalt roote out the tongues to lyeng bent: For thou, the Lord, in endles hatred hast The murdrous man and soe the fraudulent. But I my self will to thy howse addresse With pasport of thy graces manifold: And in thy feare, knees of my hart will fold, Towardes the temple of thy hollinesse. Thou Lord, thou Lord, the saver of thine owne! Guide me, Ã´ in thy justice be my guide: And make thy waies to me more plainly known, For all I need, that with such foes do bide. For in their mouth not one cleare word is spent, Mischief their soules for inmost lyning have: Their throate it is an open swallowing grave, Whereto their tong, is flattring instrument. Give them their due unto their guiltinesse Let their vile thoughts the thinckers ruine be: With heaped weights, of their own sinns oppresse These most ungratefull rebells unto thee. So shal all they that trust on thee doe bend, And love the sweete sound of thy name, rejoyce: They ever shall send thee their praising voice; Since ever thou to them wilt succour send. Thy work it is to blesse, thou blessedst them The just in thee, on thee and justice build: Thy work it is such men safe in to hemm With kindest care, as with a certain shield. Psalm VI. Domine ne in furore. Lord lett not mee a worm by thee be shent While thou art in the heate of thy displeasure: Ne let thy rage; of my due punnishment Become the measure. But mercy Lord, lett mercy thine descend, For I am weake, and in my weaknes languish: Lord help, for ev'n my bones their marrow spend With cruell anguish. Nay ev'n my soule fell troubles do appall. Alas how long my God wilt thou delay me? Turn thee, sweete Lord, and from this ougly fall My deere God stay me. Mercy, Ã´ mercy Lord, for mercies sake, For death doth kill the wittnes of thy glory, Can of thy praise the tongues entombed make A heav'nly story? Loe I am tir'd while still I sigh and grone: My moistned bed proofes of my sorrow showeth: My bed (while I with black night moorn alone) With my teares floweth. Woe, like a Moth, my faces beutie eates, And age pul'd on with paines all freshnes fretteth; The while a swarm of foes with vexing feates My life besetteth. Gett hence you evill, who in my ill rejoice, In all whose works vainenesse is ever raigning: For God hath heard the weeping sobbing voice Of my complayning. The Lord my suite did heare, and gently heare They shall be sham'd and vext, that breed my cryeng: And turn their backs, and straight on backs appeare Their shamfull flyeng. Psalm VII. Domine, Deus meus. O Lord, my God, thou art my trustfull stay: O save me from this persecutions show'r: Deliver me in my endangerd way. Least Lion-like, he doe my soule devoure; And cruelly in many peeces teare, While I am voide of any helping pow'r. O Lord, my God, if I did not forbeare Ever from deede of any such desert: If ought my handes of wickednes do beare: If I have byn unkinde for frendly part: Nay if I wrought not for his freedoms sake, Who causlesse now, yeeldes me a hatefull hart: Then let my foe chase me, and chasing take: Then lett his foote upon my neck be set: Then in the dust lett hym my honor rake. Arise, Ã´ Lord, in wrath thy self up sett Against such rage of foes; awake for me To that high doom, which I by thee must gett. So shall all men with laudes inviron thee Therefore Ã´ Lord lift up thy throne on high That ev'ry folk thy wondrous acts may see. Thou Lord, the people shalt in judgment try: Then Lord, my Lord give sentence on my side After my clearnesse, and my equity. O let their wickednes no longer bide From comming to the well deserved end: But still be thou to just men justest guide. Thou righteous proofes to hartes and reines dost send: And all my helpe from none but thee is sent, Who dost thy saving-health to true men bend. Thou righteous art, thou strong, thou pacient: And each day art provok'd thyne ire to show: And if this man will not learn to repent, For hym thou whettst thy sword and bend'st thy bow, And hast thy deadly armes in order brought, And ready art to lett thyne Arrowes go. Lo he that first conceav'd a wretched thought, And greate with child of mischief travel'd long, Now brought a bed, hath brought nought foorth but nought. A pitt was digg'd by this man vainly strong, But in the pitt he ruin'd first did fall, Which fall he made, to doe his neighbour wrong. He against me doth throw, but down it shall Upon his pate; his paine emploied thus And his own ill, his own head shall appall. I will give thancks unto the Lord of us According to his heav'nly equity, And will to highest name yeeld praises high. Psalm VIII. Domine, Dominus. O Lord that rul'st our mortall lyne How through the world thy name doth shine: That hast of thine unmatched glory Upon the heav'ns engrav'n the story. From sucklings hath thy honor sprong, Thy force hath flow'd from babies tongue: Whereby thou stopp'st thine en'mies prating Bent to revenge and over-hating. When I upon the heav'ns do look, Which all from thee their essence took; When Moon and Starrs, my thoughts beholdeth Whose life no life but of thee holdeth: Then thinck I: Ah, what is this man: Whom that greate God remember can? And what the race of him descended, It should be ought of God attended. For though in lesse then Angells state Thou planted hast this earthly mate: Yet hast thou made ev'n hym an owner Of glorious crown, and crowning honor. Thou placest hym upon all landes To rule the workes of thine own handes: And so thou hast all things ordained, That ev'n his feete, have on them raigned. Thou under his dominion plac't Both sheepe and oxen wholy hast: And all the beastes for ever breeding, Which in the fertill fieldes be feeding. The Bird, free-burgesse of the Aire, The Fish, of sea the native heire: And what things els of waters traceth The unworn pathes, his rule embraceth. O Lord that rul'st our mortall lyne, How through the world thi name doth shine. Psalm IX. Confitebor tibi. With all my hart, Ã´ Lord I will praise thee, My speaches all thy mervailes shall discry: In thee my joyes and comfortes ever be Yea ev'n my songs thy name shall magnify, Ã´ Lord most hie. Because my foes to fly are now constrain'd, And they are fall'n, nay perisht at thy sight: For thou my cause, my right thou hast maintain'd, Setting thy self, in throne which shined bright, Of judging right. The Gentiles thou rebuked sorely hast, And wicked folks, from thee to wrack do wend: And their renown, which seem'd so like to last; Thou dost put out, and quite consuming send To endles end. O bragging foe, where is the endles wast Of conquer'd states, whereby such fame you gott? What? doth their memory no longer last? Both ruines, ruiners, and ruin'd plott Be quite forgott. But God shall sitt in his eternall Chaire, Which he prepar'd to give his judgmentes high: Thither the world for justice shall repaire: Thence he to all, his judgments shall apply Perpetually. Thou Lord also th'oppressed wilt defend, That they to thee in troublous tyme may flee: They that know thee, on thee their trust will bend, For thou Lord found by them wilt ever be, That seake to thee. O praise the Lord, this Syon-dweller good, Shew foorth his actes, and this as act most high: That he enquiring, doth require just blood, Which he forgetteth not, nor letteth dy Th'afflicted cry. Have mercy, mercy Lord, I once did say, Ponder the paines which on me loaden be By them whose mindes on hatefull thoughts do stray: Thou Lord that from death-gates hast lifted me, I call to thee. That I within the portes most bewtifull Of Sions daughter may sound foorth thi praise: That I, ev'n I, of heav'nly comfort full May only joy in all thy saving waies Through out my daies. No sooner said, but lo mine enymies sinck Down in the pitt which they them selves had wrought: And in that nett which they well hidden think, Is their own foote, led by their own ill thought, Most surely caught. For then the Lord in judgment showes to raign, When godlesse men be snar'd in their own snares: When wicked soules be turned to hellish pain, And that forgettfull sort, which never cares What God prepares. But on the other side, the poore in sprite Shall not be scrapt, from out of heav'nly score: Nor meeke abiding of the pacient wight Yet perish shall (although his paine be sore) For evermore. Up Lord and judg the Gentiles in thy right, And lett not man have upper hand of thee: With terrors greate, Ã´ Lord, doe thou them fright: That by sharp proofes, the heathen them selves may see But men to be. Psalm X. Ut quid Domine? Why standest thou soe farre O God, our only starre, In time most fitt for thee To help who vexed be! For lo with pride the wicked man Still plagues the poore the most he can: O lett proud hym be throughly caught In craft of his own crafty thought. For he him self doth praise When he his lust doth ease: Extolling rav'nous gaine, But doth God's self disdaine. Nay so proud is his puffed thought, That after God he never sought: But rather much he fancies this; The name of God a fable is. For while his waies doe prove, On them he setts his love: Thy judgments are to hie, He can them not espy. Therefore he doth defy all those; That dare them selves to him oppose: And saieth in his bragging hart, This gotten blisse, shall never part. Nor he removed be, Nor danger ever see: Yet from his mouth doth spring Cursing, and cosening Under his tongue do harbour'd ly Both mischief and iniquity. For proof, ofte laine in wait he is In secrete by-way villages. In such a place unknown To slay the hurtlesse one; With wincking eies ay bent Against the innocent. Like lurking Lion in his den, He waites to spoile the simple men: Whom to their losse he still doth gett, When once he draw'th his wily nett. O with how simple look, He ofte laieth out his hooke! And with how humble showes To trapp poore soules he goes! Thus freely saieth he in his sprite: God sleepes, or hath forgotten quite, His farr-of sight now hud-winck is, He leisure wants to mark all this. Then rise and come abroad, O Lord, our only God: Lift up thy heav'nly hand And by the silly stand. Why should the evill, so evill despise The pow'r of thy through-seeing eyes? And why should he in hart soe hard Say, thou dost not thine own regard? But nak'd before thin eyes All wrong and mischief lies: For of them in thy handes The ballance ev'nly standes. But who aright poore-minded be Committ their cause, them selves to thee, The succour of the succourles The father of the fatherles. Breake thou the wicked arme, Whose fury bendes to harme: Search them, and wicked he Will straight way nothing be. O Lord we shall thy title sing, Ever and ever, to be king Who hast the heath'ny folk destroi'd From out thy land by them anoi'd. Thou op'nest heav'nly dore To praiers of the poore: Thou first prepar'd their mind, Then eare to them enclind. O be thou still the Orphans aid, That poore from ruyne may be staid: Least we should ever feare the lust Of earthly man, a lord of dust. Psalm XI. In Domino confido. Since I do trust Jehova still, Your fearfull wordes why do you spill That like a bird to some strong hill I now should fall a flyeng. Behould the evill have bent their bow, And sett their arrowes in a row, To give unwares a mortall blow To hartes that hate all lyeng. But that in building they begunn With ground-plotts fall, shalbe undunn: For what, alas, have just men donn? In them no cause is growing. God in his holy temple is: The throne of heav'n is only his Naught his all-seeing sight can misse; His ey-lidds peise our going. The Lord doth search the just mans reynes, But hates, abhorrs, the wicked braines, On them stormes, brimstone, coales he raines: That is their share assigned. But so of happy other side His lovely face on them doth bide In race of life their feete to guide Who be to God enclined. Psalm XII. Salvum me fac. Lord helpe it is hygh tyme for me to call, No men are left that charity doth love: Nay ev'n the race, of good men are decai'd. Of things vaine with vaine mates they babble all Their abject lipps, no breath but flattry move Sent from false hart on double meaning staid. But thou (Ã´ Lord) give them a thorough fall: Those lyeng lipps, from cosoning head remove, In falshood wrapt, but in their pride displaid. Our tongues, say they, beyond them all shall goe: We both have pow'r, and will our tales to tell: For what lord rules our brave emboldned brest? Ah now ev'n for their sakes, that tast of wo, Whom troubles tosse, whose natures need doth quell Ev'n for the sighes, true sighes of man distrest: I will gett up saith God, and my help show Against all them, that against hym do swell, Maugre his foes, I will him sett at rest. These are Gods wordes, Gods words are ever pure: Pure, purer then the silver throughly tride, When fire seav'n tymes hath spent his earthy parts. Then thou (Ã´ Lord) shalt keepe the good still sure: By thee preserv'd, in thee they shall abide: Yea in no age, thy blisse from them departes. Thou seest each side the walking doth endure Of these badd folks, more lifted up with pride, Which if it last, wo to all simple hartes. Psalm XIII. Usque quo, Domine? How long (Ã´ Lord) shall I forgotten be? What? ever? How long wilt thou thi hidden face from me Dissever? How long shall I consult with carefull sprite In anguish? How long shall I with foes triumphant might Thus languish? Behold me Lord, let to thy hearing creep My crying. Nay give me eyes, and light, least that I sleep In dying. Least my foe bragg, that in my ruyne he Prevailed: And at my fall they joy that, troublous, me Assailed. Noe, noe, I trust on thee, and joy in thy Greate pitty: Still therefore of thy graces shalbe my Songs ditty. Psalm XIV. Dixit insipiens. The foolish man by flesh and fancy ledd, His guilty hart with this fond thought hath fed: There is noe God that raigneth. And so thereafter he and all his mates Do workes, which earth corrupt, and Heaven hates: Not one that good remaineth. Even God him self sent down his piercing ey, If of this clayy race he could espy One, that his wisdome learneth. And loe, he findes that all a strayeng went: All plung'd in stincking filth, not one well bent, Not one that God discerneth. O maddnes of these folkes, thus loosly ledd! These Caniballs, who, as if they were bread Gods people do devower. Nor ever call on God; but they shall quake More then they now do bragg, when he shall take The just into his power. Indeede the poore, opprest by you, you mock: Their councells are your common jesting stock: But God is their recomfort. Ah, when from Syon shall the saver come That Jacob freed by thee, may glad become And Israel full of comfort? Psalm XV. Domine, quis habitabit? In tabernacle thine Ã´ Lord who shall remaine? Lord of thy holy hill, who shall the rest, obtaine? Ev'n he that leades a life of uncorrupted traine, Whose deedes of righteous hart, whose harty wordes be plain: Who with deceitfull tongue, hath never us'd to faine, Nor neighboure hurtes by deede nor doth with slander stain: Whose eyes a parson vile, doth hold in vile disdaine, But doth with honor greate, the godly entertaine: Who othe and promise given, doth faithfully maintain, Although some worldly losse thereby he may sustain: From bityng Usury who ever doth refraine: Who sells not guiltlesse cause for filthy love of gain: Who thus proceedes for ay in sacred mount shall raign. Psalm XVI. Conserva me. Save me Lord, for why thou art All the hope of all my hart: Wittnesse thou my soule with me, That to God, my God I say; Thou my Lord, thou art my stay, Though my workes reach not to thee. This is all the best I prove: Good and godly men I love: And forsee their wretched paine, Who to other gods doe runne: Their blood offrings I do shunne, Nay to name their names disdaine. God my only portion is, And of my childes part the blisse: He then shall maintaine my lott. Say then is not my lott found In a goodly pleasant ground? Have not I faire partage gott? Ever Lord I will blesse thee, Who dost ever councell me, Ev'n when night with his black wing Sleepy darknes doth orecast, In my inward raines I tast Of my faultes and chastening. My eyes still my God reguard, And he my right hand doth guard; So can I not be opprest, So my hart is fully gladd, So in joy my glory cladd, Yea my flesh in hope shall rest. For I know the deadly grave On my soule noe pow'r shall have: For I know thou wilt defend Even the body of thine own Deare beloved holy one, From a fowle corrupting end. Thou lifes path wilt make me knowe In whose view doth plenty growe All delights that soules can crave And whose bodies placed stand On thy blessed-making hand They all joies like-endless have. Psalm XVII. Exaudi Domine justitiam. My suite is just, just Lord, to my suite hark I plaine: sweete Lord, my plaint for pitty mark. And since my lipps faine not to thee, Thine eares vouchsave to bend to me. O let my sentence passe from thine own face: Shew that thine eyes respect a faithfull case. Thou that by proofe accquainted art With inward secretts of my hart. Where silent night might seeme all faultes to hide, Then was I, by thy searching insight tride: And then by thee, was guiltlesse found From ill word, and ill meaning sound. Not waighing ought how fleshly fancies runn, Ledd by thy word, the rav'ners stepps I shunn; And pray that still you guide my way, Least yet I slipp, or goe astray. I say againe that I have cal'd on thee, And boldly saie thou wilt give eare to me: Then let my wordes, my cries ascend Which to thy self my soule will send. Show then Ã´ Lord, thy wondrous kindnesse show: Make us in mervailes of thy mercy know, That thou by faithfull men wilt stand, And save them from rebellious hand. Then keepe me as the Aple of an ey: In thy wings shade then lett me hidden ly, From my destroyeng wicked foes Who for my death do me enclose. Their eies doe swimme, their face doth shine in fatt, And cruell wordes their swelling tongues do chatt; And yet their high hartes looke so low As how to watch our overthrow. Now like a Lion, gaping to make praies Now like his whelpe, in denne, that lurking staies: Up Lord, prevent those gaping jawes, And bring to naught those watching pawes. Save me from them, thou usest as thy blade, From men I say, and from mens worldly trade: Whose life doth seeme most greatly blest, And count this life their portion best. Whose bellies soe with dainties thou dost fill, And so with hidden treasures graunt their will: That they in ritches floorish doe, And children have to leave it to. What would they more? And I would not their case: My joy shalbe pure; to enjoy thy face, When waking of this sleepe of mine I shall see thee in liknesse thine. Psalm XVIII. Diligam te. Thee will I love, O Lord, with all my hartes delight, My strength, my strongest Rock which my defence hast born: My God, and helping God, my might, and trustfull might, My never-pierced shield, my ever-saving horne, My refuge, refuge then, when moste I am forlorne: Whom then shall I invoke, but thee most worthy praise, On whom (against my foes) my only safty staies? On me the paines of death allready gan to pray: The fludds of wickednesse on me did horrors throw: Like in a winding sheete, wretch, I already lay, All-ready, ready to my snaring grave to goe. This my distresse to God, with wailefull cries I show: My cries climb'd up, and he bent down from sacred thron His eyes unto my case, his eares unto my moane. And so the earth did fall to tremble and to quake, The Mountaines proudly high, and their foundations bent With motion of his rage, did to the bottome shake. He came, but came with smoake, from out his nostrells sent: Flames issu'd from his mouth, and burning coales out went; He bow'd the heav'ns, and from the bow'd heav'ns did descend With hugy darknes, which aboute his feete did wend. The Cherubins their backs, the windes did yeeld their wings To beare his sacred flight; in secrete place then clos'd; About which he dimme cloudes, like a pavillion brings Cloudes ev'n of waters dark, and thickest aire compos'd. But streight his shining eyes this misty masse disclos'd, Then haile, then firy coales, then thundred heav'nly sire, Then spake he his lowd voice, then hailstones, coles, and fire. Then out his Arrowes fly; and streight they scattred been: Lightning on lightning he did for their wrack augment: The gulphes of waters then were through their chanells seen: The Worldes foundations then lay bare; because he shent With blasting breath Ã´ Lord, that in thy chiding went. Then sent he from above, and tooke me from below, Ev'n from the waters depth, my God preserv'd me soe. So did he save me, from my mighty furious foe, So did he save me, from their then prevailing hate: For they had caught me up, when I was weake in wo: But he staff of my age: he staid my stumbling state: This much: yet more, when I by him this freedom gate, By him because I did find in his ey-sight grace He lifted me, unto a largely noble place. My Justice, my just handes thus did the Lord reward, Because I walk'd his waies, nor gainst him evilly went: Still to his Judgmentes look't: still for his statutes car'd: Sound and upright with him, to wickednes not bent. Therefore I say again, this goodnes he me sent, As he before his eyes, did see my justice stand: According as he saw the purenes of my hand. Meeke to the meeke thou art, the good thy goodnes tast: Pure, to the pure, thou deal'st with crooked crookedly: Up then; thou lifts the poore, and downe the proud wilt cast: Up, thou dost light, my light, and cleare my darkned ey. I hoastes orecome by thee: by thee ore walles I fly: Thy way is soundly sure, thy word is purely tride: To them that trust in thee, a shild thou dost abide. For who is God besides this greate Jehova oures? And so besides our God, who is indu'd with might? This God then girded me in his all-mighty pow'rs, He made my combrous way, to me most plainly right: To match with lightfoote Staggs, he made my foote so light, That I climb'd highest hill; he me warre-pointes did show, Strength'ning mine armes, that they could breake an Iron bow. Thou gav'st me saving shield: thy right hand was my stay, Me in encreasing still, thy kindnesse did maintaine: Unto my strengthned stepps, thou didst enlardge the way, My heeles, and plantes, thou didst from stumbling slip sustain: What foes I did pursue, my force did them attain That I ere I retorn'd, destroi'd them utterly, With such brave woundes, as they under my feete did ly. For why my fighting strength, by thy strength, strengthned was: Not I, but thou throwst down those, who gainst me do rise, Thou gavest me their necks, on them thou mad'st me passe: Behold they cry, but who to them his helpe applies? Nay unto thee they cri'd, but thou heardst not their cries: I bett those folkes as small as dust, which wind doth raise, I bett them as the clay, is bett, in beaten waies. Thus freed from mutinn men, thou makest me to raign; Yea thou dost make me serv'd by folks I never knew: My name their eares, their eares their harts to me enchain'd: Ev'n feare makes strangers shew much love, though much untrue. But they do faile, and in their mazed corners rue: Then live Jehova still, my Rock still blessed be: Lett hym be lifted up, that hath preserved me. He that is my reveng, in whom I Realmes subdue; Who freed me from my foes, from Rebells garded me: And ridd me from the wronges which cruell witts did brew. Among the Gentiles then I (Lord) yeeld thancks to thee, I to thy name will sing, and this my song shall be: He nobly saves his king, and kindnes keepes in store, For David his anoint and his seed evermore. Psalm XIX. CÅli enarrant. The heav'nly frame, setts foorth the fame Of him that only thunders: The firmament so strangly bent Showes his hand-working wonders. Day unto day, it doth display, Their course doth it acknowledg: And night to night succeeding right In darknes teach cleare knowledg. There is no speach, nor language, which Is soe of skill bereaved: But of the skies the teaching cries They have heard and conceaved. There be no eyne, but read the line From soe faire booke proceeding: Their wordes be sett in letters greate For ev'ry bodies reading. Is not he blind that doth not find The tabernacle builded There by his grace, for sunnes faire face In beames of beuty guilded! Who foorth doth come, like a bridgroome From out his vailing places: As gladd is hee, as Giantes be To runne their mighty races. His race is ev'n, from endes of heav'n About that vault he goeth: There be no Reames hid from his beames His heate to all he throweth. O law of his, how perfect tis The very soule amending Gods wittnes sure, for ay doth dure To simplest, wisdome lending. Gods doomes be right, and cheere the sprite: All his commandments being So purely wise, as give the eies Both light, and force of seeing. Of him the feare, doth cleannes beare And soe endures for ever: His Judgments be self verity They are unrighteous never. Then what man would, so soone seeke gold Or glittring golden money? By them is past, in sweetest tast Honny, or combe of honny. By them is made, thy servantes trade Most circumspetly guarded: And who doth frame, to keepe the same Shall fully be rewarded. Who is the man, that ever can His faultes know and acknowledg! O Lord clense me, from faultes that be Most secret from all knowledg. Thy servant keepe, lest in him creepe Presumptuous sinnes offences: Let them not have, me for their slave, Nor raigne upon my sences. Soe shall my sprite be still upright In thought and conversation; Soe shall I bide, well purifide From much abhomination. Soe lett wordes sproong, from my weake tongue And my hartes meditation, My saving might, Lord, in thy sight Receave good acceptation. Psalm XX. Exaudiat te Dominus. Lett God, the Lord heare thee, Even in the day, when most thy troubles be: Let name of Jacobs God, When thou on it dost cry, Defend thee still from all thy foes abroad. From sanctuary hy Let him come downe, and helpe to thee apply From Sions holy topp Thence lett him undertake With heav'nly strength thy earthly strength to propp. Lett him notorious make, That in good part he did thy offrings take. Let fire for triall burne (Yea fire from him self sent) Thy offrings, soe, that they to ashes turne. And soe lett him consent To graunt thy will, and perfect thy entent That in thy saving we May joy, and banners raise Up to our God, when thy suites graunted be. Now in me knowledg saies, That God from fall his own annointed staies. From heav'nly holy land I know that he heares thee; Yea heares with powres, and helps of helpfull hand. Lett trust of some men be In Charriotts arm'd, others in Chivalry: But lett all our conceite Upon Gods holy name, Who is our Lord, with due remembrance waite. Behold their broken shame! We stand upright, while they their fall did frame. Assist us Saviour deere; Lett that king daine to heare, When as to him our praiers do appeare. Psalm XXI. Domine in virtute. New joy, new joy unto our king, Lord, from thy strength is growing: Lord what delight to him doth bring His safty, from thee flowing! Thou hast giv'n what his hart woulde have, Nay soone as he but moved, His lipps to crave, what he would crave, He had as him behoved. Yea thou prevent'st ere aske he could, With many lib'rall blessing. Crown of his head with Crown of gold Of purest mettall dressing. He did but aske a life of thee, Thou him a long life gavest: Loe ev'n unto eternity The life of hym thou savest. We may well call his glory greate, That springs from thy salvation: Thou, thou it is, that hast hym sett In soe high estimation. Like storehouse thou of blessings mad'st This man of everlasting: Unspekably his hart thou gladst, On hym thy count'naunce casting. And why all this? because our king In heav'n, his trust hath laied: He only leanes on highest thing, Soe from base slipp is staid. Thy hand thy foes shall overtake, That thee so evill hated: Thou as in fyery ov'n shalt make These mates to be amated. The Lord on them with causfull ire Shall use destroyeng power: And flames of never-quenched fire Shall these badd wightes devower. Their fruite shalt thou from earthly face Send unto desolation: And from among the humane race Roote out their generation. For they to overthrow thy will Full wilyly entended: But all their bad mischevous skill Shall fruitlessly be ended. For like a mark thou shalt a row Sett them in pointed places: And ready make thy vengfull bow Against their guilty faces. Lord in thy strength, Lord in thy might, Thy honor high be raised And so shall in our songs delight Thy power still be praised. Psalm XXII. Deus Deus meus. My God, my God, why hast thou me forsaken? Wo me, from me, why is thy presence taken? Soe farre from seeing, mine unhealthfull eyes: Soe farre from hearing to my roaring cries. O God, my God, I crie while day appeareth: But God thy eare, my cryeng never heareth. O God the night, is privie to my plaint Yet to my plaint, thou hast no audience lent. But thou art holy and dost hold thy dwelling Where Israell thy lawdes is ever telling Our fathers still to thee their trust did beare; They trusted, and by thee delivered were. They were sett free, when they upon thee called, They hop'd on thee, and they were not appalled. But I a worme not I of mannkind am, Nay shame of men, the peoples scorning game. The lookers now at me, poore wretch, be mocking, With mowes, and nodds, they stand about me flocking. Let God help him (say they) whom he did trust: Lett God save hym in whom was all his lust. And yet even from the wombe thy selfe did'st take me: At mothers brests, thou did'st good hope betake me. No sooner my child eyes could looke abroade, Then I was giv'n to thee, thou wert my God. O be not farre, since paine so neerly presseth, And since there is not one, who it redresseth. I am enclos'd with yong Bulls madded rowt Nay Basan mighty Bulls close me about. With gaping mouthes, these folkes, on me have chardged, Like Lions fierce, with roaring jawes enlarged. On me all this, who do like water slide, Whose loosed boanes quite out of joynt be wri'd. Whose hart, with these huge flames, like wax oreheated Doth melt away, though it be inmost seated: My moist'ning strength is like a pottsherd dride, My cleaving tongue, close to my roofe doth bide. And now am brought, alas, brought by thy power Unto the dust of my deathes running hower: For bawling doggs, have compast me about, Yea worse then doggs, a naughty wicked rowt. My humble handes, my fainting feete they pearced: They looke, they gaze, my boanes might be rehearsed Of my poore weedes they do partition make, And doe cast lotts, who should my vesture take. But be not farre Ã´ Lord, my strength my comfort, Hasten to help me, in this deepe discomfort. Ah from the sword, yet save my vitall sprite, My desolated life from dogged might. From Lions mouth (Ã´ help) and show to heare me By aiding, when fierce Unicornes come neere me To brethern then, I will declare thy fame, And with these wordes, when they meete, praise thi name. Who feare the Lord, all praise and glory beare hym You Israells seed, you come of Jacob, feare hym. For Hee hath not abhor'd, nor yet disdain'd The silly wretch, with fowle affliction stain'd. Nor hid from him his faces faire appearing. But when he cal'd, this Lord did give hym hearing: In congregation greate, I will praise thee: Who feare thee shall my vowes performed see. Th'afflicted then shall eate, and be well pleased: And God shalbe, by those his seakers praised. Indeede Ã´ you, you that be such of mind, You shall the life, that ever-liveth find. But what? I say from earthes remotedst border Unto due thoughts, mannkind his thoughts shall order And turne to God, and all the Nations be Made worshippers, before allmighty thee. And reason, since the Crowne to God pertaineth, And that by right upon all Realmes he raigneth. They that be made, ev'n fatt, with earthes fatt good Shall feede, and laud the giver of their food. To him shall kneele even who to dust bee stricken, Even hee whose life, no helpe of man can quicken His service shall from child to child descend, His doomes one age shall to another send. Psalm XXIII. Dominus regit me. The Lord, the Lord my shepheard is, And so can never I Tast missery. He rests me in greene pasture his: By waters still, and sweete Hee guides my feete. Hee me revives: leades me the way, Which righteousnesse doth take, For his names sake. Yea though I should through valleys stray, Of deathes dark shade, I will Noe whitt feare ill. For thou deere Lord, thou me besett'st: Thy rodd, and thy staff be To comfort me Before me thou a table sett'st, Even when foes envious ey Doth it espy. Thou oil'st my head thou fill'st my cupp: Nay more thou endlesse good, Shalt give me food. To thee, I say, ascended up, Where thou, the Lord of all, Dost hold thy hall. Psalm XXIV. Domini est terra. The Earth is Gods, and what the globe of earth containeth, And all who in that globe doe dwell: For by his pow'r, the land upon the Ocean raigneth, Through him the fludds to their bedds fell. Who shall clime to the hill, which Gods own hill is named? Who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath hurtles handes, whose inward hart is framed All purnesse ever to embrace. Who shunning vanity and workes of vainenesse leaving Vainly doth not puff upp his mind, Who never doth deceave, and much lesse his deceaving With perjury doth falsly bind. A blessing from the Lord, from God of his salvation Sweete rightuousnesse shall he receave, Jacob this is thy seede, God seeking generation, Who search of Gods face never leave. Lift up your heades you gates; and you dores ever biding: In comes the king of glory bright. Who is this glorious king? in might and power riding? The Lord, whose strength makes battailes fight. Lift up your heades you gates, and you dores ever biding: In comes the king of glory bright. Who is this glorious king? the lord of armies guiding Even he the king of glory hight. Psalm XXV. Ad te, Domine. To thee Ã´ Lord most just; I lift my inward sight: My God in thee I trust Lett me not ruine quight: Lett not those foes, that me annoy, On my complaint build up their joy. Sure, sure, who hope in thee, Shall never suffer shame: Lett them confounded be That causlesse wrongs doe frame. Yea Lord to me thy waies doe show; Teach me, thus vext, what path to goe. Guide me as thy truth guides; Teach me for why thou art The God in whom abides The saving me from smart. For never day such changing wrought, That I from trust in thee was brought. Remember, only king, Thy mercies tendernesse: To thy remembrance bring, Thy kindnesse, lovingnesse. Let those things thy remembraunce grave, Since they eternall essence have. But Lord remember not Sinns brew'd in youthfull glasse: Nor my rebellions blott, Since youth and they do passe. But in thy kindnes me record Ev'n for thy mercies sake, Ã´ Lord. Of grace and righteousnesse The Lord such plenty hath: That he deignes to expresse To sinning men his path. The meeke he doth in judgment leade, And teach the humble how to tread. And what thinck you, may be The pathes of my greate God? Ev'n spottlesse verity And mercy spredd abroad, To such as keepe his covenaunt And on his testimonies plant. O Lord for thy name sake, Lett my iniquity Of thee some mercy take, Though it be greate in me: Oh, is there one with his feare fraught? He shalbe by best teacher taught. Lo how his blessing budds Inward, an inward rest; Outward, all outward goodes By his seede eke possest. For such he makes his secrett know, To such hee doth his cov'nant show. Where then should my eyes be, But still on this Lord sett? Who doth and will sett free My feete from tangling nett. O look, Ã´ help lett mercy fall, For I am poore, and least of all. My woes are still encreast; Shield me from these assaultes: See how I am opprest, And pardon all my faultes. Behold my foes, what stoare they be, Who hate, yea hate me cruelly. My soule which thou didst make, Now made, Ã´ Lord, maintaine: And me from these ills take, Lest I rebuke sustaine. For thou, the Lord, thou only art Of whom the trust lives in my hart. Lett my uprightnes gaine Some safty unto me: I say, and say againe, My hope is all in thee. In fine, deliver Israel O Lord, from all his troubles fell. Psalm XXVI. Judica me, Domine. Lord judge me and my case For I have made my race Within the boundes of innocence to bide: And setting thee for scope Of all my trustfull hope; I held for sure; that I should never slide. Prove me Ã´ Lord most high, Me with thy touch-stone try: Yea sound my reynes, and inmost of my hart. For so thy loving hand Before my eyes did stand, That from thy truth will not depart. I did not them frequent, Who be to vainesse bent, Nor kept with base dissemblers company. Nay I did ev'n detest Of wicked wights the neast, And from the haunts of such bad folks did fly. In th'innocence of me My handes shall washed be; And with those handes, about thy Alter waite. That I may still expresse With voice of thanckfullnes The works perform'd by thee, most wondrous greate. Lord, I have loved well The howse where thou dost dwell, Ev'n where thou mak'st thy honnors biding place. Sweete Lord, write not my soule, Within the sinners rowle: Nor my lifes cause, match with blood-seekers case. With handes of wicked shifts With right hands stain'd with gifts But while I walk in my unspotted waies Redeeme and show mee grace So I in publique place Sett on plaine ground will thee Jehovah praise. Psalm XXVII. Dominus illuminatio. The shining Lord he is my light: The strong God my salvation is. Who shall be able me to fright? This Lord with strength my life doth blisse: And shall I then Feare might of men! When wicked folke even they that be, My foes, to uttmost of their pow'r With raging jawes inviron me, My very flesh for to devow'r: They stumble so, That down they go. Then though against me armies were, My courage should not be dismaid: Though battailes brunt, I needes must beare, While battailes brunt, on me were laid, In this I would My trust still hold. One thing in-deede I did, and will For ever crave: that dwell I may In howse of high Jehova still, On beuty his mine eyes to stay, And looke into His temple too. For when greate griefes to me be ment, In tabernacle his he will Hide me, ev'n closly in his tent: Yea noble height of rocky hill He makes to be A seate for me. Now, now, shall he lift up my head On my beseeging enimies: So shall I sacrifices spread; Offrings of joy in temple his: And song accord, To praise the Lord. Heare Lord when I my voice display, Heare to have mercy eake of me. Seeke yee my face, when thou did'st say, In truth of hart I answr'd thee, O Lord I will Seeke thy face still. Hide not therefore from me that face; Since all my aid in thee I gott: In rage, thy servaunt doe not chase; Forsake not me, Ã´ leave me not, O God of my Salvation hy. Though fathers care and mothers love Abandon'd me, yet my decay Should be restor'd by hym above. Teach Lord, Lord leade me thy right way, Because of those That be my foes. Unto whose ever-hating lust Oh! give me not; for there are sprong Against me wittnesses unjust, Even such I say whose lyeng tongue Fiercely affordes, Most cruell wordes. What had I been, except I had Beleev'd Gods goodnes for to see, In land with living creatures cladd? Hope, trust in God, be strong, and hee Unto thy hart Shall joy impart. Psalm XXVIII. Ad te Domine. To thee, Lord, my cry I send: O my strength stopp not thine eare: Least if answeare thou forbeare; I be like them that descend To the pitt, where flesh doth end. Therefore while that I may cry, While I that way hold my handes Where thy Sanctuary standes: To thy self those wordes apply, Which from suing voice do fly. Linck not me in self same chaine, With the wicked working folk: Who their spotted thoughtes to cloak, Neighbours frendly entertaine, When in hartes they malice meane. Spare not them, give them reward, As their deedes have purchas'd it, As deserves their wicked witt: Fare they, as their handes have far'd: Ev'n so be their guerdon shar'd. To thy workes they give no ey: Lett them be thrown down by thee: Lett them not restored be. But lett me give praises hy To the Lord, that heares my cry. That God is my strength, my shield: All my trust on him was sett, And soe I did safely gett. Soe shall I with joy be fil'd, Soe my songues his laudes shall yeeld. God on them his strength doth lay, Who his annointed helped have. Lord then still thy people save; Blesse thine heritage I say, Feede and lift them up for ay. Psalm XXIX. Afferte Domino. Ascribe unto the Lord of light, Yee men of pow'r ev'n by birth-right Ascribe all glory and all might. Ascribe due glory to his name; And in his ever-glorious frame Of Sanctuary doe the same. Hys voice is on the waters found, His voice doth threatning thunders sound, Yea through the waters doth resound. The voice of that Lord ruling us Is strong, though hee be gratious, And ever, ever glorioues. By voice of high Jehova we The highest Cedars broken see, Ev'n Cedars which on Liban be. Nay like yong Calves, in leapes are born; And Liban self with natures skorn: And Shirion, like yong Unicorn. His voice doth flashing flames devide; His voice have trembling desertes tride; Ev'n deserts, where the Arabs bide. His voice makes hindes their calves to cast: His voice makes bald, the forrest wast: But in his Church his fame is plast. He sitts on seas, he endlesse raignes His strength his peoples strength maintaines, Which blest by him in peace remaines. Psalm XXX. Exaltabo te Domine. O Lord thou hast exalted me; And sav'd me from foes laughing scorn: I ow thee praise, I will praise thee. For when my hart with woes was torn, In cries to thee, I shew'd my cause: And was from ill by thee upborne. Yea from the Graves most hungry jawes Thou would'st not sett me on their scoare, Whom death to his cold boozome drawes. Praise, praise this Lord then evermore Ye saints of his, remembring still With thancks his holinesse therefore. For quickly endes his wrathfull will, But his deere favour where it lies, From age to age life joyes doth fill. Well may the evening cloath the eies In cloudes of teares, but soone as sunne Doth rise againe, new joyes shall rise. For proof, while I my race did runne Full of successe, fond I did say, That I should never be undonne, For then my hill good God did stay: But ah, he straight his face did hide, And what was I but wretched clay? Then thus to thee I prayeng cride, What serves alas, the blood of me When I with in the pitt doe bide? Shall ever earth give thancks to thee? Or shall thy truth on mannkind laid In deadly dust declared be? Lord heare, lett mercy thine be staid On me, from me helpe this annoy. This much I said, this beeing said, Lo I that wail'd, now daunce for joy: Thou did'st ungird my dolefull sack, And mad'st me gladsome weedes enjoy. Therefore my tongue shall never lack Thy endless praise: Ã´ God my king I will thee thancks for ever sing. Psalm XXXI. In te Domine speravi. All, all my trust, Lord, I have putt in thee, Never therefore, lett me confounded be, But save me, save me in thy righteousnes. Bow down thine eare; to heare how much I need: Deliver me, deliver me in speed: Bee my strong Rock, be thou my fortresse. In deede thou art my Rock, my fortresse: Then since my tongue, delights, that name to blesse, Direct me how to goe, and guide me right. Preserve me from the wyly wrapping nett, Which they for me, with privie craft have sett: For still I say thou art my only might. Into thy handes, I doe commend my spright: For it is thou, that hast restor'd my light: O Lord that art the God of verity. I hated have those men, whose thoughtes do cleave To vanities: which most trust, most deceave: For all my hope fixt upon God doth ly. Thy mercy shall fill me with jolity, For my annoies have come before thine ey: Thou well hast known what plung my soule was in. And thou hast not for ay enclosed me Within the hand of hatefull enmity: But hast enlarg'd my feete from mortall ginn. O Lord of thee, lett me still mercy wynne; For troubles, of all sides, have me within: My ey, my gutts, yea my soule grief doth wast. My life with heavines, my yeares with moane. Doe pine: my strength with paine is wholy gon: And ev'n my boanes consume, where they be plast. All my feirce foes reproach on me did cast: Yea neighbours more, my mates were so agast, That in the streetes from sight of me they fledd: Now I, now I my self forgotten find, Even like a dead man, dreamed out of mind, Or like a broken pott, in myre tredd. I understand what railing greate men spredd: Feare was each where, while they their councells ledd All to this pointe, how my poore life to take But I did trust in thee, Lord I did say, Thou art my God, my time on thee doth stay: Save me from foes, who seeke my bane to bake. Thy face to shine upon thy servaunt make, And save me in, and for thy mercies sake; Lett me not tast of shame, Ã´ Lord most hy. For I have cal'd on thee; let wicked folk Confounded be; and passe away like smoak; Lett them in bedd of endlesse silence dy. Lett those lipps be made dumb, which love to ly: Which full of spight, of pride, and cruelty Doe throw their wordes against the most upright. Oh, of thy grace what endlesse pleasure flowes To whom feare thee? what thou hast donne for those That trust in thee, ev'n in most open sight? And when neede were, from pride in privie plight Thou hast hidd them; yet leaving them thy light From strife of tongues, in thy pavilions plast. Then praise, then praise I doe the Lord of us Who was to me more then most gratious Farre farre more sure, then walls most firmly fast. Yet I confesse in that tempestious hast, I said, that I from out thy sight was cast: But thou didst heare, when I to thee did moane Then love the Lord all ye that feele his grace: Who paires the proud, preserves the faithfull race, Be strong in hope, his strength shall you supply. Psalm XXXII. Beati, quorum. Blessed is hee whose filthy staine The Lord with pardon doth make cleane, Whose fault well hidden lieth. Blessed in deede to whom the Lord Imputes not sinnes to be abhord, Whose spirit falshood flieth. Thus I prest down with weight of paine, Whether I silent did remaine, Or roar'd, my boanes still wasted. For soe both day and night did stand On wretched me, thy heavie hand, My life hott tormentes tasted. Till my self did my faultes confesse; And opened mine own wickednes, Whereto my hart did give me: So I my self accus'd to God, And his sweete grace streight eas'd the rodd, And dyd due paine forgive me. Therefore shall every godly one In fitt time make to thee his moane, When thou wilt deigne to heare hym. Sure, sure the flood of strayeng streames, How ever they putt in their claimes, Shall never dare come neere hym. Thou art my safe and secrett place, Who savest me from troublous case, To songs and joyfull biding. But who so will instructed be, Come, come the way I will teach thee; Guide thee by my eyes guiding. Oh, be not like a horse, or Mule Wholy devoide of reasons rule; Whose mouthes thy self dost bridle: Knowing full well, that beastes they be, And therefore soone would mischief thee, If thou remained'st idle. Woes, woes shall come to wicked folkes. But who on God, his trust, invokes, All mercies shalbe swarmed. Be gladd you good, in God have joy, Joy be to you, who doe enjoy Your hartes with cleernesse armed. Psalm XXXIII. Exultate justi. Rejoyce in God, O ye That righteous be: For cheerefull thanckfullnesse It is a comly part In them, whose hart Doth cherish rightfullnesse. O praise with hart the Lord, O now accord Vialls with singing voice: Lett tenne string'd instrument O now be bent To wittnes you rejoice. A new, sing a new song To him most strong, Sing lowd and merrily: Because that word of his, Most righteous is And his deedes faithfull be. Hee righteousnesse approves And judgment loves: Gods goodnesse fills all landes. His word made heav'nly coast, And all that hoast By breath of his mouth stands. The waters of the seas In heapes he laies, And depthes in treasure his, Lett all the earth feare God: And who abroad Of world a dweller is. For he spake not more soone: Then it was done: He bade, and it did stand. He doth heathen councell breake, And maketh weake The might of peoples hand. But ever, ever shall His counsells all Through-out all ages last. The thinckings of that mind No end shall find When Times, tymes shalbe past. That Realme indeede hath blisse, Whose God he is, Who him for their Lord take: Even people that, ev'n those, Whom this Lord chose His heritage to make. The Lorde lookes from the sky: Full well his ey Beholdes our mortall race. Even where he dwelleth he, Through-out doth see Who dwell in dusty place. Since he their hartes doth frame, He knowes the same: Their workes hee understandes. Hoasts doe the king not save; Nor strong men have Their help from mighty handes. Of quick strength is an horse And yet his force, Is but a succour vaine: Who trusts hym sooner shall Catch harmefull fall Then true deliveraunce gayn. But lo, Jehovas sight On them doth light Who him do truly feare: And them who do the scope Of all their hope Upon his mercy beare. His sight is them to save Ev'n from the grave, And keepe from famynes paine. Then on that Lord most kind Fix we our mynd, Whose shield shall us maintayne. Our hartes sure shall enjoy In hym much joy Who hope on his name just. O lett thy mercy greate On us be sett, We have no plea, but trust. Psalm XXXIV. Benedicam Domino. I, even I will allwaies Give harty thancks to hym on high And in my mouth contynnually Inhabit shall his praise. My soule shall glory still In that deere Lord with true delight: That hearing it the hartes contrite May learne their joyes to fill. Come then and joyne with me; Somwhat to speake of his due praise: Strive we, that in some worthy phraze His name may honor'd be. Thus I beginne; I sought This Lord, and he did heare my cry: Yea and from dreadfull missery He me, he only brought. This shall menns fancies frame To looke and runne to hym for aide, Whose faces on his comfort staid Shall never blush for shame. For lo this wretch did call, And lo his call, the skies did clime: And God freed hym in his worst tyme From out his troubles all. His Angells armies round Aboute them pitch, who hym do feare: And watch, and ward for such do beare, To keepe them safe and sounde. I say but tast and see, How sweete how gratious is his grace: Lord hee is in thrice blessed case Whose trust is all on thee. Feare God, ye saintes of his, For nothing they can ever want Who faithfull feares in hym do plant: They have, and shall have blisse. The Lions ofte lack foode, Those raveners whelpes oft starved be: But who seeke God with constancy Shall neede nought that is good. Come children lend your eare To me and mark what I do say: For I will teach to you the way How this our Lord to feare Among you, who is heere, That life and length of life requires And blessing such, with length desires, As life may good appeare. Keepe well thi lipps and tongue; Least inward ills doe them defile: Or that by wordes, enwrapt in guile Another man be stong. Doe good, from faultes declyne, Seeke peace, and follow after it: For Gods own eyes on good-men sitt, And eares to them enclyne. Soe his high heavenly face Is bent, but bent, against those same That wicked be, their very name From earth quite to displace. The just when harmes app[r]oach, Do cry, their cry of hym is heard: And by his care from them is barr'd All trouble, all reproach. To humble broken myndes, This Lord is ever, ever neere: And will save whome his sight cleere In spirit afflicted findes. Indeede the very best Most greate and greevous paines doth beare: But God shall him to safty reare, When most hee seemes opprest. His boanes he keepeth all, So that not one of them is broke; But malice shall the wicked choak, Who hate the good shall fall. God doth all soules redeeme Who weare his blessed livery: None I say still, shall ruin'd be, Who hym their trust esteeme. Psalm XXXV. Judica, Domine. Speake thou for me, against wrong speaking foes: Thy force O Lord against their force oppose. Take upp thy shield and for my succour stand Yea take thy launce and stoppe the way of those That seeke my bane; O make me understand In sprite, that I shall have thy helping hand. Confounde those folks, thrust them in shamfull hoale That hunt so poore a pray, as is my soule. Rebuke, and wrack, on those wrong-doers throw Who for my hurt, each way their thoughtes did roule. And as vile chaff, away the wind doth blow, Lett Angell thine, a scatt'ring make them goe. Lett Angell thine pursue them as they fly But lett their flight be dark, and slippery For causles they, both pitt, and nett did sett: For causles they, did seeke to make me dy: Lett their sly witts unwares destruction gett: Fall in self pitt, be caught in their own nett. Then shall I joy in thee, then sav'd by thee I both in mind, and boanes shall gladded be. Ev'n boanes shall say (Ã´ God) who is thy peere? Who poore and weake, from ritch, and strong dost free. Who helpest those, whose ruine was so neere, From him whose force did in their spoiles appeere. Who did me wrong, against me wittnesse beare, Layeng such things, as never in me weare: So my good deedes they pay, with evill share With cruell mindes, my very soule to teare. And whose? ev'n his, who when they sicknes bare, With inward woe, an outward sack-cloth ware. I did pull down my self, fasting for such, I praid, with praiers, which my brest did touch: In summe I shew'd, that I to them was bent As brothers, or as freendes beloved much. Still, still, for them I humbly moorning went, Like one that should, his mothers death lament. But lo, soone as they did me stagg'ring see, Who joy but thei, when they assembled be? Then abjects, while I was unwitting quite Against me swarme, ceaslesse to raile at me With scoffers false, I was theyr feasts delight, Even gnashing teeth, to wittnesse more their spight. Lord wilt thou see, and wilt thou suffer it? Oh; on my soule, let not these tumults hitt. Save me distrest, from Lions cruell kind. I will thanck thee, where congregations sitt, Even where I do most store of people find, Most to thy laudes will I my speeches bind. Then, then lett not my foes unjustly joy: Let them not fleere, who me would causles stroy. Who never word of peace yet utter would, But hunt with craft the quiett mans annoy. And said to me, wide mowing, as they could: A, ha: Sir, now we see you, where we should. This thou hast seene: and wilt thou silent be? O Lord doe not absent thi self from me: But rise, but wake, that I may judgment gett. My Lord, my God, ev'n to my equity, Judg Lord: judge, God, ev'n in thy justice greate: Lett not their joy, upon my woes be sett. Lett them not, Lord, within their harts thus say: O soule rejoyce, we made this wretch our pray. But throw them down, put them to endles blame, Who make a cause to joy, of my decay. Lett them be cloth'd, with most confounding shame, That lift them selves my ruine, for to frame. But make such gladd and full of joyfullnesse; That yet beare love, unto my righteousnesse: Yet, let them say, laud be to God allwaies, Who loves with good, his servaunts good to blesse. As for my tongue, while I have any daies, Thy justice wittnesse shall, and speake thy praise. Psalm XXXVI. Dixit injustus. Me thincks amidd my hart I heare; What guilty wickednes doth say, Which wicked folkes doe holde soe deare: Even thus it self, it doth display, No feare of God, doth once appeare, Before his eyes that soe doth stray. For those same eies, his flatterers be, Till his known ill do hatred gett: His wordes, deceipt, iniquity His deedes: yea thoughts all good forgett. A bedd on mischief, muzeth he, Abroad his stepps be wrongly sett. Lord how the heav'ns thy mercy fills? Thy truth above the cloudes most hy: Thy righteousnesse like hugest hills, Thy judgments like the deepes do ly. Thy grace with safty man fulfills, Yea beastes, made safe, thy goodenesse try. O Lord how excellent a thing Thy mercy is; which makes mannkind Trust in the shadow of thy wing. Who shall in thy house fattnesse find, And drinck from out thy pleasures spring Of pleasures past, the reach of mind. For why, the well of life thou art And in thy light, we shall see light. O then extend thy loving hart To them, that know thee, and thy might: O then thy righteousnes impart To them, that be in soules upright. Lett not proud feete make me their thrall; Lett not ill handes, disscomfit me; Lo there, I now foresee their fall; Who doe ill workes: loe I do see They are cast down, and never shall Have powre againe, to raised be. Psalm XXXVII. Noli Ã¦mulari. Frett not thy self, if thou do see That wicked men do seeme to flourish: Nor envy in thy bozome nourish Though ill deedes well succeeding be. They soone shalbe cutt down like grasse; And wither like greene hearb or flower: Do well, and trust on heav'nly power, Thou shalt have both good food and place. Delight in God, and he shall breede The fullnesse of thy own hartes lusting: Guide thee by him, lay all thy trusting On hym, and he will make it speed. For like the light he shall display Thy Justice, in most shining lustre: And of thy judgment make a mustre Like to the glory of noone day. Waite on the Lord with patient hope; Chafe not at some manns greate good fortune: Though all his plotts without misfortune, Attaine unto their wished scope. Fume not, rage not, frett not I say; Least such thinges synne in thy self cherish: For those bad folks, at last shall perish: Who stay for Godd, in blisse shall stay. Watch but a while, and thou shalt see The wicked by his own pride banisht: Looke after him, he shalbe vanisht, And never found againe shalbe. But meeke men shall the earth possesse; In quiett home they shalbe planted: And this delight to them is granted, They shall have peace in plenteousnesse. Evill men, work ill to uttmost right, Gnashing their teeth full of disdayning: But God shall scorne, their moody meaning For their short time is in his sight. The evill bent bowes, and swordes they drew, To have their hate on good soules wroken: But lo, their bowes they shalbe broken, Their swordes, shall their own hartes embrew. Small goodes in good men better is, Then of bad folkes the wealthy wonder: For wicked armes shall breake asunder, But God upholdes the just in blisse. God keepes accompt of good menns daies, Their heritage shall last for ever: In perill they shall perish never, Nor want in dearth, their want to ease. Badd folkes shall fall, and fall for ay: Who to make warre, with God presumed, Like fatt of lambes shalbe consumed: Ev'n with the smoake shall wast away. The naughty borrowes, payeng not; The good is kind, and freely giveth. Loe, whom God blest, hee blessed liveth: Whom he doth curse, to naught shall rott. The mann whom God directs, doth stand Firme on his way, his way God loveth: Though he doth fall no wrack he proveth: He is upheld by heav'nly hand. I have beene yong now old I am, Yet I the man that was betaken To Justice, never saw forsaken: Nor that his seede a begging came. He lendes, he gives, more he doth spend, The more his seede in blessing flourish: Then fly all ill, and goodnes nourish, And thy good state, shall never end. God loving right doth not forsake His holy ones; they are preserved From tyme to tyme, but who be swarved To ill, both they and theirs shall wrack. I say, I say the righteous mindes Shall have the land in their possessing, Shall dwell thereon, and this their blessing No time within his limitts bindes. The good mouth will in wisdome bide, His tongue of heav'nly Judgments telleth: For Gods high law in his hart dwelleth, What coms thereof? he shall not slide. The wicked watch the righteous much, And seeke of life for to bereave him: But in their hand God will not leave him, Nor lett him be condempn'd by such. Waite thou on God, and keepe his way, He will exalt thee unto honor: And of the earth make thee an owner, Yea thou shalt see the evill decay. I have the wicked seene full sound, Like lawrell fresh him self out-spreading: Lo hee was gon, print of his treading, Though I did seeke, I never found. Marke the upright, the just attend: His ende shalbe in peace enjoyed: But straiers vile, shalbe destroied, And quite cutt of with helplesse end. Still, still the godly shalbe staid By Gods most sure, and sweete salvation: In time of greatest tribulation He shalbe their true strength and aid. He shalbe their true strength and aid, He shall save them from all the fetches Against them us'd, by wicked wretches: Because on him their trust is laid. Psalm XXXVIII. Domine ne in furore. Lord, while that thy rage doth bide, Do not chide: Nor in anger chastise me, For thy shafts have peirc'd me sore; And yet more Still thy hands upon me be. No sound part caus'd by thy wrath My flesh hath: Nor my synns lett my boanes rest. For my faults are highly spredd On my hedd, Whose foule weights have me opprest. My woundes putrify, and stinck, In the sinck Of my filthy folly laid: Earthly I do bow and crook, With a look Still in moorning cheere araid. In my Reynes hott torments raignes, There remaines Nothing in my bodie sound. I am weake and broken sore, Yea I roare, In my hart such griefe is found. Lord before thee I do lay What I pray: My sighes are not hid from thee My hart pants, gon is my might, Even the light Of myne eyes abandons me. From my plague, kinne, neighbour, frend Farre of wend: But who for my life do waite, They lay snares, they nimble be, Who hunt me, Speaking evill, thincking deceite. But I like, a mann become, Deafe and dumb, Little hearing, speaking lesse, I even as such kind of wight, Senclesse quite, Word with word do not represse. For on the, Lord, without end I attend: My God, thou wilt heare my voice For I said, heare, least they be Gladd on me, Whome my fall doth make rejoyce. Sure I do but halting goe, And my woe Still my orethwart neighbour is. Lo I now to moorne beginne For my sinne, Telling mine iniquities. But the while, they live and grow In greate show. Many, mighty, wrongfull foes: Who do evill for good, to me Enimies be, Why? because I vertue chose. Do not Lord, then me forsake, Doe not take Thy deere presence farre from me, Haste Ã´ Lord, that I be staid By thy aid, My salvation is in thee. Psalm XXXIX. Dixi custodiam. Thus did I thinck, I well will marke my way, Least by my tongue I happ to stray. I musle will my mouth, while in the sight I do abide of wicked wight. And so I nothing said, but muett stood, I silence kept, even in the good. But still the more that I did hold my peace, The more my sorrow did encrease. The more me thought, my hart was hott in me, And as I mus'd such world to see, The fire, tooke fire, and forcibly out brake; My tongue would needes and thus I spake: Lord unto me my times just measure give, Show me how long, I have to live: Lo thou a spanns length, mad'st my living line. A spanne? nay nothing in thine eyne. What do we seeke? the greatest state I see, At best is meerly vanity. They are but shades, not true things where we live: Vaine shades, and vaine, in vaine to grive. Looke but on this: man still doth ritches heape, And knowes not, who the fruite shall reape. This beeing thus, for what Ã´ Lord waite I? I wait on thee, with hopefull ey. O helpe, Ã´ helpe me; this farre yet I crave, From my transgressions me to save. Lett me not be throwne down, to so base shame, That fooles of me, maie make their game. But I doe hush, why do I say thus much? Since it is thou that mak'st one such. Ah! yet from me lett thy plagues be displac'd, For with thy handy stroakes I wast. I know that manns fowle sinne doth cause thy wrath For when his sinne thy scourging hath, Thou moath-like makes his bewty fading be; Soe what is manne, but vanity? Heare Lord my suites, and cries: stopp not thine eares At these my wordes all cloth'd in teares: For I with thee; on earth a stranger am, But baiting, as my fathers came. Stay then thy wrath, that I maie strength receave, Ere I my earthly beeing leave. Psalm XL. Expectans expectavi. While long I did with patient constancy, The pleasure of my God attend, He did him self to me-ward bend, And harkned how and why that I did cry. And me from pitt bemired From dungeon he retired, Where I, in horrors lay: Setting my feete upon A steedfast rocky stone; And my weake stepps did stay. Soe in my mouth he did a song affoord, New song unto our God of praise: Which many seeing hartes shall raise To feare with trust, and trust with feare the Lord. Oh, he indeede is blessed Whose trust is so addressed: Who bendes not wandring eyes To greate mens pecock pride, Nor ever turnes a side To follow after lies. My God thy wondrous workes how manyfold! What manne thy thoughts can count to thee? I faine of them would speaking be; But they are more then can by me be told. Thou sacrifice nor offring Burnt offring, nor sinne offring Didst like much lesse did'st crave: But thou didst peirce my eare; Which should thie leassons beare; And wittnesse me thy slave. Thus bound I sayd loe Lord I am at hand For in thy bookes rowle, I am writt. And sought with deedes, thy will to hitt, Yea Lord thy law within my hart doth stand: I to greate congregation, Thou know'st, made declaration Of this sweete righteousnes: My lipps shall still reveale, My hart shall not conceale Thy truth, health, gratiousnes. Then, Lord from me, draw not thy tender grace: Me still in truth, and mercy save. For endlesse woes, me compast have, So prest with synnes, I cannott see my case. But triall well doth teach me; Fowle faultes sore paines do reach me; More then my head hath heares. So that my surest part, My life-maintaining hart, Failes me, with ougly feares. Vouchsave me helpe Ã´ Lord and helpe with hast: Lett them have shame, yea blush for shame; Who joyntly sought, my bale to frame: Lett them be curst away that would me wast. Lett them with shame be cloied, Yea lett them be destroied, For guerdon of their shame: Who-so unpittious be; As now to say to me; A ha! this is good game. But fill their hartes with joy, who bend their waies, To seeke thy bewty past conceite, Lett them that love thy saving seate, Still gladly say, unto our God be praise. Though I in want be shrincking, Yet God on me is thincking. Thou art my help for ay, Thou only thou art he, That dost deliver me; My God, Ã´ make noe stay. Psalm XLI. Beatus qui intelligit. Hee blessed is who with wise temper can Judg of th'afflicted man. For God shall him deliver in the tyme, When most his troubles clime. The Lord will keepe his life yet safe &amp; sound With blessings of the ground. And will not him unto the will expose, Of them that be his foes. When bedd from rest becoms his seate of woe, In God his strength shall grow: And turne his couch, where sick he couched late, To well recovered state. Therefore I said in most infirmity, Have mercy Lord on me: O heale my soule lett there thy cure beginne, Where gainst thee lay my sinne. My foes evill wordes, their hate of me display, While thus alas they say: When, when will death oretake this wretched wight, And his name perish quite? Their curteous vissittings, are courting lyes They inward evills disgise, Even heapes of wicked thoughts, which streight they show As soone as out they goe. For then their hatefull heades, close whispring be, With hurtfull thoughts to me Now he is wrackt, say they, loe there he lies, Who never more must rise. O, yea my frend, to whome I did impart The secretts of my hart. My freend, I say, who at my table sate, Did kick against my state. Therefore Ã´ Lord, abandon'd thus of all, On me lett mercy fall: And raise me up, that I may once have might, Their meritts to requite: But what? this doth already well appeare That I to thee am deere: Since foes, nor have, nor shall have cause to be Triumphing over me. But triumph well may I, whome thou do'st stay In my sound rightfull way: Whom thou (Ã´ place of places all) do'st place For ay before thy face. Soe then be blest now, then, at home, abroad, Of Israell the god: World without end, lett this his blessing flow, Oh soe; oh be it soe. Psalm XLII. Quemadmodum. As the chafed hart which braieth, Seeking some refreshing brooke: So my soule in panting plaieth, Thirsting on my God to looke. My soule thirsts indeede in mee After ever-lyving thee. Ah when comes my blessed beeing, Of thy face to have a seeing! Day and night my teares out-flowing Have been my ill feeding food: With their daily questions throwing; Where is now, thy God soe good? My hart melts remembring soe, How in troupes I woont to goe: Leading them, his praises singing, Holy daunce to Gods howse bringing. Why art thou my soule soe sory, And in me soe much dismaid? Waite on God for yet his glory In my songue shalbe displaid. When but with one looke of his He shall me restore to blisse: Ah my soule it self appalleth; In such longing thoughtes it falleth. For my mynd on my God bideth, Ev'n from Hermons dwelling ledd, From the groundes where Jordan slideth, And from Myzars hilly hedd. One deepe with noise of his fall Other deepes of woes doth call: While my God, with wasting wonders On me wretch his tempest thunders. All thy floodes on me abounded, Over me all thy waves went: Yet thus still my hope is grounded, That thy anger beeing spent, I by day thy love shall tast: I by night shall singing last: Prayeng, praiers still bequeathing To my God, that gave me breathing. I will say Ã´ Lord my tower, Why am I forgott by thee? Why should griefe my hart devower While the foe oppresseth me? Those vile scoffs of naughty ones Wound and rent me to the bones: When foes aske with fowle deriding Where is now your God abiding? Why art thou my soule soe sory, And in me soe much dismaid? Waite on God for yet his glory In my songe shalbe displaid. To him my thancks shalbe said, Who is still my present aid: And in fine my soule be raised, God is my God, by me praised. Psalm XLIII. Judica me Deus. Judge of all, judge me And protector be Of my cause oppressed By most cruell sprites; Save me from bad wights, In false coullers dressed. For my God thy sight Giveth me my might, Why then hast thou left me? Why walk I in woes? While prevailing foes Have of joyes bereft me? Send thi truth and light, Let them guid mee right From the pathes of folly: Bringing me to thy Tabernacle hy, In thy hill most holly. To Godds Alters tho Will I boldly goe; Shaking of all saddnes; To that God that is God of all my blisse, God of all my gladdnes. Then loe, then I will With sweete musicks skill Gratfull meaning show thee: Then God, yea my God, I will sing abroade What greate thancks I ow thee. Why art thou my soule Cast down in such dole? What ailes thy discomfort? Waite on God, for still Thanck my God, I will, Sure aid, present comfort.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Volume IV The First Booke or Acte of the Countess of Pembrookes ARCADIA [Thy Elder care shall from thy carefull face] Thy Elder care shall from thy carefull face By Princely meane bee stolne, and yet not lost; Thy Younger shall with Natures bliss embrace An uncouth Love, whiche Nature hateth moste: Thow with thy Wyffe adultery shalt committ, And in thy Throne, a forreyn State shall sitt, All this on thee this fatall yeare shall hitt. [Transformde in shewe, but more transformde in mynde] Transformde in shewe, but more transformde in mynde, I cease to stryve, with duble Conquest foylde; For, woe ys mee, my powers all (I fynde) With owtewarde force, and inward treason spoylde. For, from withoute, came to myne eyes the blowe, Whereto, myne Inwarde thoughtes did faintly yeelde: Bothe these conspirde pore Reasons overthrowe, False in my self, thus have I lost the feelde. And thus myne eyes are plaste still in one sighte, And thus my thoughtes can thinck but one thing still: Thus, reason to his servantes gives his righte, Thus ys my power transformed to youre will. What marvell then I take a Womans hewe? Since, what I see, thincke, knowe, ys all but yow? [What lengthe of verse can serve, brave Mopsas good to showe] What lengthe of verse can serve, brave Mopsas good to showe, Whose vertues strange, &amp; beutyes suche, as no man them may knowe: Thus shrewdly burdened then, how can my Muse escape; The godds must help, and precyous thinges must serve to shew her shape. Like great god Saturne, faire, and like faire Venus chaste, As smoothe as Pan, as Juno, mylde, lyke goddess Iris faste. With Cupid shee foresees, and goes god Vulcans pace, And for a taste of all these giftes shee borowes Momus grace. Her forehead Jacincth lyke, her cheekes of Opall hewe, Her twinckling eyes bedect w?? perle, her lippes of Saphire blewe. Her heare pure Crapall stone, her Mouthe, O heavenly wyde, Her skinne like burnisht golde, her handes like silver Owir untryde. As for those partes unknowne, whiche hidden sure are best Happy bee they w?? well beleeve, and never seeke the rest. [Come Shepearde weedes become youre Masters mynde] Come Shepearde weedes become youre Masters mynde, Yeelde owteward shewe, what Inwarde chaunge hee tryes: Nor bee abashed, synce suche a guest yow fynde, Whose strongest hope in youre weyke comforte lyes. Come Shepeard weedes attend my woofull Cryes, Disuse youre selves from sweete Menalcas voyce: For others bee those Tunes w?? sorrowes tyes, From those clere notes w?? freely may rejoyce. Then powre oute pleynte, and in one worde say this: Helples his pleynte, who spoyles him self of blis. [Now thancked bee the great god Pan] Now thancked bee the great god Pan, That thus preserves my loved lyfe: Thancked bee I that keepe A man, Who ended hathe this fearefull stryfe. So, yf my Man must prayses have; What then must I, that keepe the knave? For, as the Moone the eye dothe please, With gentle beames not hurting sighte: Yet hathe Sir Sunn the greatest prayse, Bycause from him dothe come her lighte. So, yf my man must prayses have; What then must I, that keepe the knave? [Come Dorus come, Let Songes thy sorrowes signify] Lalus. Come Dorus come, Let Songes thy sorrowes signify, And, yf for want of use thy mynde ashamed ys, That very shame, with Loves hye tytle Dignify: No style ys helde for base, where Love well named ys. Eche eare suckes up the wordes a true Love scattereth, And playne speeche ofte, then quaynte phrase better framed ys. Dorus. Nightingales sildome singe, the Pye still chattereth, The wood cryes moste, before yt throwly kindled bee, Deadly woundes inward bleede, eche sleight sore mattereth: Hardly they hearde, w?? by good Hunters singled bee, Shallow brookes murmer moste, Depe sylent slyde away, Nor true Love Loves, his Loves with others mingled bee. Lalus. Yf thow wilt not bee seene, thy face goo hyde away, Bee none of us, or else meynteyne oure fashyon, Who frownes at others feastes, dothe better byde away, But yf thow haste a Love in that Loves passyon I Challenge thee by shewe of her perfection Whiche of us Twoo deserveth moste Compassyon. Dorus. Thy Chalenge greate, but greater my protection, Singe then, and see, for now thow haste enflamed mee, Thy healthe to meane a Matche for my infection, No though the Heavens for highe Attempt have blamed mee Yet, highe ys myne Attempt (O Muse) historify Her prayse, whose prayse to learne, youre skill hathe framed mee. Lalus. Muse, holde youre peace, but thow my God Pan glorify, My Kalas giftes, who with all good giftes filled ys. Thy Pype (O Pan) shall help, thoughe I singe sorily, A heape of sweetes shee ys where no thing spilled ys; Who, thoughe shee bee no Bee, yet full of hony ys A Litle feelde, with plowe of Rose w?? tilled ys. idem. Mylde as a Lambe, more deynty than a Cony ys, Her eyes my eye sighte ys, her Conversacyon, More glad to mee, then to a Myser mony ys: What Coy accoumpte shee makes of estimacyon, Howe nice to tuche, how all her speeches peized bee, A Nimphe thus turned, but mended in translation. Dorus. Suche Kala ys, but, Ah, my fancyes raysed bee, In one whose name, to name were highe presumption, Synce vertues all to make her Tytle pleased bee, O happy goddes, w?? by Inward assumption; Enjoy her sowle, in bodyes fayre possession, And keepe yt joyned fearing youre Seates consumption. idem. Howe ofte with rayne of teares, Skyes make Confession, Theyre Duellers rapt with sighte of her perfection, From heavenly throane to her heaven use digression: Of best thinges then, what worlde can yeelde confection, To licken her, deck youres with youre Comparyson She ys herself of best thinges the Collection. Lalus. Howe ofte my Dolefull Sire, cryed to mee, tarry, sonne, (When firste hee spyde my Love) howe ofte hee saide to mee, Thow arte no Souldyer fitt for Cupides guarryson, My sonne keepe this, that my long toyle hathe layde to mee, Love well thyne owne (mee thincke) wolles whitenes passeth all. I never founde longe Love, suche wealthe hathe payde to mee, idem. This wynde, hee spent, but when my Kala glasseth all My sighte, in her faire Ly?es, I then assure my self, Not rotten sheepe, but hye Crownes, shee surpasseth all, Can I bee pore, that her golde hayer procure my self. Want I white woolle, whose eyes her white skinne garnished? Till I gett her, shall I to keepe enure my self? Dorus. Howe ofte when reason sawe Love of her harnished, With Armor of my harte hee cryed, O, vanitye? To sett a Perle in steele, so meanely varnished? Looke to thy self, reache not beyonde humanity? Her mynde, beames, state, farr from thy weyke winges banished And Love whiche Lover hurtes ys inhumanity. idem. Thus reason sayde, but shee came, reason vanished, Her eyes so mastering mee, that suche objection Seemde but to spoyle the foode of thought longe famished; Her pereles heighte, my mynde to hye erection, Drawes up, and yf (hope fayling) ende lyves pleasure, Of fayrer Deathe how can I make election. Lalus. Once my well wayting eyes espyed my treasure With sleeves turnde up, loose hayer, and brestes enlarged, Her Fathers Corne mooving, her fayres Ly?es measure, O (Cryed I) of so meane worcke bee discharged? Measure my Case, how by thy Beutyes fillinge With seede of woes, my harte bry?full ys charged. idem. Thy Father biddes thee save, and Chydes for spilling, Save then my sowle, spill not my thoughtes well heaped, No Lovely prayse was ever gott by killinge, These bolde wordes shee did heare, this fruite I reaped, That shee whose Looke alone mighte make mee blessed Did smyle on mee, and then away shee leaped. Dorus. O sweete, once, I sawe with Drede oppressed, Her whome I Drede, so that, with prostrate lying, Her Lengthe the earthe in Loves cheef Clothing dressed, I sawe that Riches falle, and fell a Cryinge, Lett not deade Earthe enjoy so deare a Cover, But Deck there with my sowle, for youre sake dyinge. Idem. Lay all youre feare uppon youre Fearefull Lover; Shyne eyes on mee, that bothe oure Lyves bee guarded; So I youre sighte, yo? shall youre selves recover, I cryed, and was with open Rayes, rewarded, But, streight they fledd, summond' by crewell honor, Honor, the Cause, Desert ys not regarded. Lalus. This Mayde thus made for joyes, (O Pan) bemone her, That withoute Love, shee spendes her yeares of Love, So fayre a feelde woulde well become an Owner, And yf enchauntement can a hard harte moove, Teache mee what Circle can acquaynte her spirite Affections charmes in my behalf to proove. The Circle ys my (Rounde aboute her) sighte The power I will Invoke dwelles in her eyes My Charme shoulde bee, shee haunte mee day and nighte. Dorus. Farr other Case, (O Muse) my sorrowe tryes, Bent to suche one in whome my self must saye, No thing can mende one poynte, that in her lyes: What Circle then in so rare force beares sway, Whose spirit all Spirites can spoyle, rayse, dampne or save, No Charme holdes her, but well possess shee may Possess shee dothe and makes my sowle her Slave, My eyes the bandes, my thoughtes the fatall knott, No thralles like them, that Inwarde bondage have. Lalus. Kala, at lengthe conclude my Lingering Lott, Disdayne mee not, allthoughe I bee not fayre, Who ys an heyre, of many hundred sheepe Dothe beutyes kepe, whiche never sone can burne, Nor stormes do turne, fayrenes serves ofte to wealthe. Yet, all my healthe, I place in youre good will. idem. Whiche, yf yow will, (O Doo) bestowe on mee, Suche as yow see, suche still yow shall mee fynde, Constant, and kynde, my sheepe youre foode shall breede, Theyre woolle youre weede, I will yo? musick yeelde, In flowery fielde, and as the day beginnes, With Twenty ginnes, wee will the smalle Byrdes take, And pastymes make, as Nature thinges hathe made, But when in shade, wee meete of Mirtle bowes, Then Love allowes, Oure pleasures to enriche, The thoughte of whiche, dothe pass all worldly pelf. Dorus. Lady youre self, whome neyther name I dare, And tytles are, but spottes to suche a worthe, Her playntes come forthe, from Dongeon of my mynde, The Noblest kynde, rejectes not others woes, I have no shewes of welthe, my Wealthe ys yow, My Beutyes hew, youre beames, my healthe youre Deedes, My mynde for weedes, youre vertuous Livery weares, My foode ys teares, my Tunes Weymenting yeelde. Idem. Dispayre my feelde, the flowers, Spirittes, Warres My day newe Cares, my ginnes my daily sighte, In whiche do lighte, smalle Byrdes of thoughtes overthrown My Pastymes none, Tyme passeth on my falle, Nature made all, But mee of Doloures made I fynde no shade, But where my sunne dothe burne, No place to turne, Withowte, Within yt fryes, Nor help by lyfe, or Deathe who living dyes. Lalus. But yf my Kala, this my suite denyes, Whiche so muche reason beares: Let Crowes pick owte myne eyes, Whiche to muche sawe, Yf shee still hate loves Lawe, my earthy moulde dothe melt in watery teares. Dorus. My earthy moulde do melt in watery teares, And they ageane resolve, to ayer of sighes, Sighes to the hartes fyer turne, w?? dothe to Asshes burne, Thus dothe my lyfe within yt self dissolve. Lalus. Thus dothe my Lyfe within yt self Dissolve, That I growe like the Beaste, Whiche beares the Bitt: A weyker force dothe guyde: Yet pacyence must abyde. Suche weight yt hathe, whiche once ys full possest. Dorus. Suche weighte yt hathe, whiche once ys full possest, That I became a Vision, Whiche hathe in others hed his onely beeyng, And lives in Francyes seeyng, O wretched state of man, in self Division? Lalus. O wretched state of man in self Division? O, well thow sayest, a feeling declaracion? Thy tongue hathe made of Cupides deepe incision, But now hoÃ¢rse voyce dothe fayle this occupacyon. And others longe to tell theyre Loves Condicion, Of singing, thow haste gott the Reputacyon. Dorus. Of singing, thow haste gott the Reputacyon, Good Lalus myne, I yeelde to thy habillity My harte dothe seeke an other estimacyon, But, Ah (my Muse) I woulde thow hadst facility? To worcke my Goddess so by thy Invention; On mee to cast those eyes, where shyne Nobility, Seene &amp; knowne, hearde, but, withoute attention. [Pore Paynters ofte, with silly Poettes joyne] Pore Paynters ofte, with silly Poettes joyne, To fill the worlde w?? straunge but vayne Conceyptes: One bringes the Stuff, the other stampes the Coyne, Whiche breedes nought else but glosses of Deceiptes: Thus Paynters Cupid paynte, thus Poettes doo, A naked god, blynde, younge, with Arrowes twoo. Is hee a God, that ever flies the Lighte? Or naked hee disguysd' in all untruthe: Yf hee bee blynde how hitteth hee so righte, Or ys hee younge, that tamed oulde Phebus youthe. But, Arrowes twoo and tipt w?? golde or leade, Some hurt accuse a thirde with horned heade. No, no thinge so; an oulde false knave hee ys, By Argus gott on Io, then a Cowe: What tyme for her Juno her Jove did misse, And charge of her to Argus did allowe. Mercury killed his false Syre for this Acte: His Damme a Beast was pardoned beastly facte. With fathers Deathe, and Mothers guilty shame, With Joves disdayne, at suche a Rivalls seede, The wretche compelde, a Rouneagate became; And learned what evell a miser state dothe breede, To lye, to steale, to prye and to accuse, Nought in him self eche other to abuse. Yet, beares hee still his Parentes stately giftes, A horned head Cloven feete, and thowsand eyes, Some gasing still some winckinge wyly shiftes, With longe large eares where never Rumor dyes, His horned heade dothe seeme the heaven to spighte: His Cloven feete dothe never treade arighte, Thus half a Man, with many easily hauntes, Clothde in the shape w?? soonest may deceyve, Thus half a Beast, eche beastly vyce hee plantes, In those weyke hartes, that his advyce receyve. Hee proulles eche place, still in newe Coloures deckt, Sucking ones evill, an other to infect. To narrow brestes hee comes all wrapte in gayne, To swelling hartes hee shynes in honors fyer, To open eyes all Beutyes hee dothe Rayne, Creeping to eche, with flatering of Desyer, But, for that Love ys worste w?? Rules the eyes, Thereon his Name, there his cheef tryumphe lyes. Millions of yeares this oulde Drivell Cupid lives, While still more wretche, more wicked hee dothe prove; Till nowe at lengthe, that Jove him office gives, At Junos sute, who muche did Argus love: In this oure worlde, a hangman for to bee: Of all those fooles, that will have all they see. [Upp, upp Philisides, Let sorowes goo] Geron. Philisides. Histor. Geron. Upp, upp Philisides, Let sorowes goo, Who yeeldes to woo, dothe but encrease his smarte. Doo not thy hart, to playntfull Custome bringe, But, let us singe, sweete tunes doo passyons ease, And olde man heare, who woulde thy fancyes rayse. Philisides. Who myndes to please the mynde drownde in Annoyes? With outeward Joyes, whiche inlie can not sincke, As well may thinck, with Oyle to coole the fyer, Or with desyer, to make suche foe a frende, Who dothe his sowle to endles mallice bend. Geron. Yet sure, an ende, to eche thing tyme dothe give, Thoughe woes now live, at length thy woes must dye, Then vertue trye, yf shee can worcke in thee, That whiche wee see, in many tyme hathe wroughte And weykest hartes to Constant temper broughte. Philisides. Who ever taughte a skilless man to teache, Or stopp a breache, that never Canon sawe, Sweete vertues Lawe, barres not a Causefull moane, Tyme shall in one, my lyfe and sorowes ende, And mee perchaunce youre Constant temper lende. Geron. What can amend, where Phisick ys refused, The wittes abusde, with will, no Counsell take, Yet, for my sake, Discover us thy greef Ofte comes Releef when moste wee seeme in trapp, The starres thy state, fortune may chaunge thy happ. Philisides. Yf fortunes Lapp became my duelling place, And all the starres conspired to my good Still were I one, this still shoulde bee my Case, Ruyns Relique, Cares webb, and sorowes foode, Synce shee faire fierce to suche estate mee Galles Whose witt the starres, whose fortune fortune thralles. Geron. Alas what falles are fallen unto thy mynde, That there where thow confest thy mischeef lyes, Thy witt doste use still, still more harmes to fynde, Whome witt makes vayne or blynded with his eyes, What Counsell can preveyle, or Lighte give lighte, Synce all his force ageanst him self hee tryes, Then eche Conceypt that enters in by sighte, Ys made forsoothe a Jurate of his woes, Earthe, sea, Aire, heaven, hell and gastly spirit, Then cryes to senceles thinges w?? neither knowes, What eyleth thee, and yf they know thy mynde Woulde scorne (in man) theyre kinge, suche feeble shewes. Rebell, rebell in golden fetters bynde, This tyrant Love or rather do suppress, Those rebell thoughtes w?? are thy slaves by kynde, Let not a glittering name thy fancy dresse, In paynted Clothes because they calle yt love There ys no hate that can thee more oppresse. Begin, and half the worcke ys done, to proove, By raysing up, uppon thy self to stande, And thincke shee ys a Shee that dothe thee moove Hee water plowes, and soweth in the sande, And hopes the flickering wynde with nett to holde Who hathe his hopes layde up in womans hande. What man ys hee that hathe his freedome soulde? Ys hee a manlike man, that dothe not knowe a Man? Hathe power that sexe with brydle to withholde, A ficle sex and true in trust to no man. A servant sex, soone prowde yf they bee coyde And to Conclude, thy Mistris ys a woman. Those wordes did once the Lovelyest Shepearde use, That erste I knewe and with moste playnefull Muse Yet not of woemen Judging, as hee sayde, But forste with rage, his Rage on them obrayde. Philisides. O Godds how longe this oulde foole hathe anoyde? My wearyed eares, O gods yet graunte mee this, That, soone the worlde of his false tongue bee voyde, O Noble aige who past theyre onely blisse In beeyng hearde, untill the hearer dye, Uttering a Serpentes mynde, with Serpentes hisse. Then, who will heare a well authorized lye? And patience hathe, let him go learne of him, What swarmes of vertues did in his youthe flie Suche hartes of brass, wyse heddes, and garmentes try?, Were in his dayes, whiche hearde, one no thing heares, Yf from his wordes the falsehoodes hee do skym. And here in moste theyre folly vayne appeares, That since they still alledge when they were younge, Yt shewes they fetche theyre witt from yowthfull yeares, Lyke beaste for sacrifice, where (save the tongue, And Belly) noughte ys lefte, suche sure ys hee, This lyfe Deade man in this oulde Dongeon flonge. Oulde howses are throwne Downe, for newe wee see, The Ouldest Rammes are called from the flock, No man dothe wishe his Horse shoulde aged bee, The Auncyent Oke well makes a fyered block, Olde men them selves do love younge wyves to choose, Onely fond youthe admires a Rotten stock. Who once a white long bearde well handle Doose, (As his bearde him, not hee his bearde did beare) Thoughe Cradle witted must not honor loose, O, when will men leave of to judge by heare, And thinck them Oulde, that have the Ouldest mynde, With vertue fraughte, and full of holy feare. [Geron.] Yf that thy face were hidd, or I were blynde, I yet shoulde knowe, a young man speaketh now? Suche wandering reasons in thy speeche I fynde, Hee ys a Beaste, that Beastes use will allowe, For proof of man, who spronge of heavenly fyer Hathe strongest sowle, when moste his Raynes do bowe. But fondlinges fonde knowe not youre owne desyer, Loathe to dye younge, and then yo? must bee oulde, Fondly blame that to whiche youre selves aspier, But, this lighte Choler, that dothe make yow bolde, Rather to wronge, then unto just Defence, Ys past with mee, my blood ys waxen colde. Thy wordes, though full of malapert offence, I weyghe them not, but still will thee advise, How thow from foolish Love mayste purge thy sence, First, thincke they err, that thinck them gayly wyse, Who well can sett a passion oute to shewe, Suche sighte have they that see with gogling eyes, Passyon beares hye, when puffing witt dothe blowe, But ys in deede a Toye, yf not a Toye, Trewe Cause of evills, and Cause of Causeles woe, Yf once thow mayste that fancyes glosse destroy, Within thy self thow soone wilt bee asshamed, To bee a Player of thyne owne Anoy. Then let thy mynde with better Bookes bee tamed, Seeke to espye her faultes aswell as prayse, And let thy eyes to other sportes bee framed, In hunting Fearefull Beastes, do spende some dayes, Or catche the Byrdes with Pittfoldes, or with Lyme, Or trayne the foxe, that traynes so Crafty layes. Lye but to sleepe, and in the earthly Prime, Seeke skill of herbes in hilles, haunte brookes nere nighte, And trye with bayte, howe fish will byte some tyme, Go grafte ageane, and seeke to grafte them righte, Those pleasant plantes, those sweete and fruitfull trees, Whiche bothe the Pallat, and the eyes delighte, Cherish the hyves of wysely paynfull Bees, Let speciall Care uppon thy flock bee stayde, Suche Active mynde, but sildome passyon sees. Philisides. Hathe any man hearde, what this Oulde man sayde? Truely not, I, who did my thoughtes engage? Where all my paynes, one Looke of hers hathe payde. Histor. Thus may yow see howe youthe esteemeth aige, And never hathe therof a rightly deemde While hott desyers do raigne in fancyes rage, Till Age yt self do make yt self esteemed. [Downe, Downe Melampus, what? youre fellowe byte?] Geron. Mastix. Geron. Downe, Downe Melampus, what? youre fellowe byte? I sett yow ore the Flock I dearely Love, Them to Defend, not with youre selves to feighte, Do yow not thinck this will the wolves remove? From former feare they had of youre good myndes? When they shall suche devyded weykenes prove? What yf Lelanx a better morsell fyndes? Then thow erste knowe, rather take parte w?? him, Then jarle, Loo, Loo, even these how envy blyndes? And thow Lelanx, let not pryde make thee brym, Bycause thow haste thy fellowe overgo?, But thanck the Cause thow seest, when hee ys Dy?. Here Lelanx here, in deede ageanst thy foen, Of my good sheepe, thow never truce tyme tooke, Bee as thow arte, but bee with myne at one, For thoughe Melampus though a wolfe do looke, (For Age dothe make him of a wolvish hewe) Yet have I seene, when well a wolfe hee shooke. Foole, that I am, that with my Dogges speake grewe, Come nere good Mastix tis now full tway score, Of yeares alas, synce I good Mastix knewe, Thow heardest even now a young man snebb mee sore, Bycause I redd him, as I woulde my sone. Yowthe will have will, Aige must to age therefore. Mastix. What merveyle yf in youthe suche faultes bee done? Synce that wee see oure saddest Shepeardes oute, Who have theyre Lesson so longe tyme begun, Quickly secure, and easily in doubte. Eyther a sleepe bee all, yf noughte assayle, Or all abroade, yf but a Cubb start oute. Wee Shepeardes are like them that under sayle, Do speake hye wordes, when all the Coaste ys clere, Yet, to a Passinger, will Bonnett vayle, I Con thee thanck to whome, thy Dogges bee dere, But comonly like Curres wee do them intreate, Save, when greate neede of them perforce appeare. Then him wee kiss, whome late before wee beate, With suche Intemperance, that eche way growes, Hate of the first, Contempt of Later feate. And suche discord tuixt greatest Shepeardes flowes That, sporte yt ys, to see, with how greate Arte, By Justice worcke they, theyre owne faultes disclose. Like buysy boyes to wynn theyre Tutors harte, One saythe hee mockes, the other saythe hee playes, The Thirde his lesson myst, till all doo smart, As for the rest, how Shepeardes spend theyre dayes At Blow-poynte, Hott Cockles, or Keles (Whyle let us pass oure tyme, eche Shepeheardes sayes) So smalle accoumpte of tyme, the Shepearde feeles, And dothe not feele, that lyfe ys noughte but tyme, And when that tyme ys past, dethe holde his heeles, To age, thus do they drawe theyre youthfull pryme Knowyng no more, then what pore Tryall showes, As fish sure tryall hathe of muddy slyme. This Pattern good unto oure Children goes, For, what they see, theyre Parentes love or hate, Theyre first taughte sence preferrs to Teachers blowes, These Cocklinges cokered, wee bewayle too late, When that wee see oure ofspring gayly bent, Woemen, Manwood, and men effeminate. [Geron.] Fye Man, Fye man what wordes hathe thy toungue lent? Yet, thow arte mickle worse, than ere was I, Thy too muche zeale, I feare thy Brayne hathe spent, Wee ofte are angryer with the feeble flie, For buysynes, where yt perteynes him not, Then with the poysonous toades, that quyett lye. I pray thee, what hathe ere the Parrett gott, And yet (, they say) hee talkes in great mens bowers, A Cage, (Gylded perchance) ys all his Lott, Who, of his toungue the licoure gladly powers, A good foole calde, with payne perhaps may bee, But even for that shall suffer mighty Lowers. Let Swanns example, siker serve for thee, Who once all Byrdes in sweetly singing past, But, now to scylence turnde his Minstrelsy, For, hee woulde singe, that others were defaste, The Peacockes pryde, The Pyes pilde flatery, Cormorauntes glutt, Kytes spoile, Kinges fishers waste, The faulcons fiercenes, Sparowes lechery, The Cocowes shame, the gooses good intent, Even Turtle toughte hee with hypocrisy, And worse of other more, till by assent, Of all the Byrdes, but namely these were greeved: Of Fowles there called was a Parlement. There, was the swan? of dignity deprived, And statutes made, hee never shoulde have voyce, Synce, when I thinck, hee hathe in sylence lived, I warne thee therefore, synce thow mayste have choyse, Let not thy toungue become a fyery matche? No sworde so bytes, as that evill Toole anoyes. Let oure unparciall eyes, a litle watche, Oure owne Demeane, and soone wee wonder shall, That, hunting faultes, oure selves wee did not Catche, Into oure myndes, let us a litle falle, And wee shall fynde more faultes then Leoperdes skyn?, Then who makes us suche Judges over all, But, farewell nowe, thy faulte ys no greate sinne, Come, Come, my Curres, tis late, I will goo in. [Fortune, Nature, Love, longe hathe contended aboute mee] Dorus. Fortune, Nature, Love, longe hathe contended aboute mee, Whiche shoulde moste misery Cast on A worme y? I am; Fortune thus can say, Misery &amp; misfortune ys al one, And of mysfortune, Fortune hathe onely the gifte, With stronge Foes on Lande, on Seas w?? contrary tempestes Still doo I Crosse this wretche, what so hee taketh in hand. Tush, Tush, saide Nature, this ys all but a Tryfle, a mans lyfe Gives happes or Misshapps, eeven as hee ordereth his harte, But, so his humor I frame in a Molde of Choler adusted, That the Delightes of lyfe shall bee to him dolorus. Love smyled, and thus sayde, want, joyned to desyer ys unhappy, But yf hee noughte doo desyer, what can Heraclitus ayle? None, but I worckes by desyer, by desyer have I kindled in his sowle, Infernall Agonyes unto a Bewty Devyne. Where thow pore Nature lefte all thy due glory to fortune, Her vertue ys Soveraigne, Fortune a vassall of hers, Nature abasht went back, Fortune blusht, yet, shee replyed thus, And even in that Love shall I reserve him a spyte, Thus, Thus alas wofull in Nature, happy by Fortune, But moste wretched I am nowe Love wakes my desyer. [Yf myne eyes can speake to doo harty Arrant] Cleophila. Yf myne eyes can speake to doo harty Arrant, Or myne eyes Language, shee doo happ to judge of, So that eyes Message bee of her receyved, Hope, wee do live yet? But, yf eyes fayle then, when I moste do neede them, Or yf eyes language bee not unto her knowne, So that eyes Message do returne rejected, Hope, wee do bothe dye. Yet, Dying, and Deade, do wee singe her Honor, So become oure Tombes, Monumentes of her prayse, So becomes oure Losse the Tryumph of her game, Hers bee the glory. Yf the senceles Spheares do yet holde a Musick, Yf the Swanns sweete voyce bee not hearde, but at deathe, Yf Mute Tymber when yt hathe the lyfe loste, Yeeldeth a Lutes tune. Are then humane myndes priviledged so meanely? As that hatefull Deathe can abridge them of power, With the voyce of Truthe, to recorde to all worldes, That wee bee her spoyles. Thus not ending endes the due prayse of her prayse, Fleshly vaile Consumes, but a Sowle hathe his lyfe, Whiche ys helde in Love, Love yt ys that hathe joynde, Lyfe to this oure sowle. But yf eyes can speake to doo harty Arraunt, Or myne eyes Language shee dothe happ to judge of, So that eyes Message bee of her receyved, Hope, wee do live yet. [Lady reserved by the heavens to doo Pastors Company, honor?] Dorus. Cleophila. Dorus. Lady reserved by the heavens to doo Pastors Company, honor? Joyning youre sweete voyce to the Rurall Muse of a Dezart, Here, yow fully do fynde this straunge operacyon of Love, Howe, to the woodes Love ronnes, aswell, as ryde to the Pallace, Neyther hee beares reverence to a Prince, nor pity to a Begger. But like a poynte in mydst of a Circle, ys still of a nerenes, All, to a Lesson hee drawes, Nor hilles, nor Caves can avoyde him. Cleophila. Worthy Shepearde, by my Songe, to my self all favoure ys hapned, That to the sacred Muse, my anoyes somewhat bee reveiled, Sacred Muse, who, in one conteynes, what Nyne doo in all them? But, O happy bee yow, whiche safe from fyery reflection, Of Phebus vyolence, in shade of stately Cypres tree, Or pleasant Mirtle may teache the unfortunate Eccho, In these woodes to resounde the renoumed Name of a Goddess. Happy bee yow that may to the Sainte youre onely Idea, Allthough (simply attyrde) youre manly affections utter. Happy bee those mysshapps, whiche justly proportion holding, Give righte sounde to the eares, and enter arighte to y? judgment. But wretched bee the sowles whiche vaylde in a Contrary subject, Howe muche more wee do Love, so the less oure Loves bee beleeved. What skill serveth a Sore, of a wrong infirmity judged, What can Justice availe to a Man that telles not his owne Case? Yow, thoughe feares do abashe, in youre still possible hopes, bee, Nature ageanst, wee do seeme to rebell, seeme fooles in a vayne sute, But, (so unhearde) Condempnd, kept thence, wee doo seeke to abyde in, Self lost, and wandering, banisshed that place wee do come from. What meane ys there, alas, wee can hope oure Losse to recover. What place ys there lefte, wee may hope oure Woes to recomfort? Unto the heavens, oure winges bee to shorte; The earthe thinckes us a burden. Ayer wee do still with sighes encrease to the fyer, wee do want none, And yet, his outeward heate oure teares woulde quenche, but an inward, Fyer, no Liquor allwayes, Neptunes seate woulde bee dryed up there. Happy Shepeardes with thanckes to the Goddes, still thinck to bee thanckfull That to thy advauncement, theyre wisdomes have thee abased. Dorus.

Synce no estates bee so base, but love vouchsafeth his Arrowe, Synce no Refuge dothe serve from woundes wee do carry aboute us, Synce owteward pleasures bee but halting helps to decayed sowles, Synce that dayly wee may discerne, what fyer wee do burne in, Farre more happy bee yo?, whose greatnes gettes a free Access, Whose fayre bodily giftes are framed moste Lovely to eche eye, Vertue yow have, of vertue yo? have lefte proof to y? whole worlde, And vertue ys gratefull with beuty and Richenes adurned, Neyther Doubt yow a whitt, Tyme will youre passion utter, Hardly remaynes fyer hidd, where skill ys bent to the hyding, But in a mynde, that woulde his flames shoulde not bee expressed Nature worcketh ynoughe with a small help, for the Reveiling, Give therefore to the Muse greate prayse, in whose very likenes, Yow do aproache to the fruite, youre onely Desyers bee, to gather.

Whence may I shewe to my mynde, any lighte of a possible escape, Bounde and bounde by so noble bandes, as lothe to bee unbounde, Jaylor I am to my self, Prison and Prisoner to my owne self, Yet bee my hopes thus plaste, here fixed lives all my recomforte, That that dere Dyamond where wisdome holdeth a sure seate, (Whose force had suche force so to transforme, nay to reforme mee,) Will at lengthe perceyve these flames by her beames to bee kyndled, And will pity the wounde festered so straungely within mee, O bee yt so, graunte suche an event O goddes that event give.

Thow purest stone, whose purenes dothe present, My purest mynde, whose Temper, hardd dothe shewe: My Tempered hart, by thee my promyse sent Unto my self; Lett after Livers knowe; No fancy myne, nor others wronge suspect, Make mee (O vertuous shame,) thy Lawes neglect. O Chastity the cheef of Heavenly Lightes, Whiche makes us moste Immortall shape to beare, Holde thow my Harte, establish thow my Spirites To onely thee, my Constant Course I beare, Till spottles sowle unto thy bosome flye, Suche lyfe to leade, suche Deathe I vowe to dye.

And witnes am, how yll agree in one, A womans hand with constant Marble stone. My wordes full weyke, the Marble full of mighte, My wordes in store, the Marble all alone, My wordes black Inck, the Marble kyndly white, My wordes unseene, The Marble still in sighte May witnes beare how yll agree in one, A womans hande with constant Marble stone. [Loved I am, and yet Complayne of Love] Loved I am, and yet Complayne of Love, As Loving not, accusde, in Love I dye, When pitty moste I Crave, I Cruell proove, Still seeking Love, Love founde, as muche I dye. Burnde in my self, I muse at others fyer, What I calle wronge, I do the same and more, Barrd of my will, I doo beyonde desyer. I wayle for want, and yet am chookt with store, This ys thy worcke, thow God for ever blynde: Thoughe thousandes olde a Boy entiteled still; Thus Children do the silly byrdes they fynde, With stroking, hurte, and too muche Cramming kyll. Yet thus muche Love, (O Love) I crave of thee? Let mee bee Loved, or els not Loved bee? [Over these Brookes trusting to ease myne eyes] Over these Brookes trusting to ease myne eyes, (Myne eyes even greate in laboure with theyre teares) I layed my face, my face wherein there lyes, Clusters of Cloudes w?? no Sunne ever cleares, In watery glass my watery eyes I see: Sorrowes yll easde, where Sorrowes paynted bee. My thoughtes imprisond, in my secrett woes, With flamy breath dothe issue ofte in sounde: The sounde to this straunge Ayer no sooner goes, But that yt dothe with Echos force rebounde, And makes mee heare, the playntes I wolde refrayne Thus owteward helps my inward greef menteyne. Now in this Sande, I woulde discharge my mynde, And Cast from mee parte of my Burdenous Cares: But in the Sandes my paynes foretolde I fynde, And see therein, howe well the wryter fares. Synce streame, ayer, sand, myne eyes &amp; eares conspire What hope to quenche, where eche thing blowes y? fyer?

One wonder yet farr passeth my Conceipt? The fewell smalle, howe bee the fyers so greate? [Feede on my sheepe, my Charge, my Comforte, feede?] Feede on my sheepe, my Charge, my Comforte, feede?

Enjoy my Joyes as yow did taste my payne, While oure sonne shynes, no Cloudy greeves assayle. Feede on my Sheepe, youre Native Joyes meynteyne, Youre wolle ys riche, no toungue can tell my gayne. [Leave of my sheepe, yt ys no tyme to feede] Leave of my sheepe, yt ys no tyme to feede, My Sunne ys go?, youre pasture bareyn growes, O Crewell Sunne thy hate this harme dothe breede, Leave of my Sheepe, my shower of Teres oreflowes Youre sweetest flowers youre herbes no service yeelde My Sunne, alas, from mee for ever gooes. Leave of my Sheepe my sighes burne up youre feelde, My Playntes calle wolves, my plagues in yo? prevayle, My Sunne ys gon?, from stormes that shoulde us shielde: Leave of my Sheepe, sorowe hathe hoysed saile.

But, who by meanes of wysdome hye: Hathe saved his Charge? yt ys even I. Lett other deck theyre pryde with scarres, And of theyre woundes make brave lame showes, First lett them dye, then passe the starres, When rotten fame will tell theyre Blowes. But eye from blood, and eare frome Crye, Who hathe saved all? It ys even I.

Can Reason, then a Tyrant coumpted bee? P. Yf Reason will that Passyons bee not free. R. But Reason will, that Reason governe moste: P. And Passyon will that passyon rule the Roste. R. Youre will ys will but Reason, Reason ys: P. Will hathe his will, when Reasons will dothe mysse. R. Whome passyon leades unto his deathe, ys bent: P. And lett hym dye, so that hee dye content. R. By Nature yow, to Reason faythe hathe sworne: P. Not so; but Fellowlike together borne. R. Who passyon dothe ensewe lives in anoye; P. Who passyon dothe forsake, lives voyde of Joye. R. Passyon ys blynde, and treades an unknowne trace: P. Reason hathe eyes, to see his owne evell Case. Reason. Dare passyons then abyde in Reasons lighte? Passyon. And ys not Reason dy?ed with passyons mighte? R. O Foolish thinge, whiche glory doest destroy. P. O gloryous Tytle of a Foolish Toye. R. Weykenes yow are, dare yo? with oure strengthe feighte? P.

Dicus. Dorus tell mee, where ys thy wonted Motyon? To make these woodes resound thy Lamentacyon: Thy Sainte ys Deade, or Deade ys thy Devotyon, For, who dothe holde his Love in estimatyon, (To witnes that hee thinckes his thoughtes Delicious) Seekes to make eche thing Badge of his sweet passyon. Dorus. But what dothe make thee Dicus, so suspicyous? Of my due faythe whiche needes must bee Immutable, Who others vertue doubtes, them selves are vicyous? Not so, allthoughe my mettle were moste mutable, Her Beames hathe wroughte therein moste sure impressyon. To suche a force, soone Chaunge were nothing sutable. Dicus. The hart well sett, dothe never shonne Confessyon, Yf Noble bee thy Bandes, make them Notoryous, Sylence dothe seeme the Maske of base oppressyon. Who gloryes in his Love dothe make Love gloryous, But who dothe beare, or bydes mute willfully, Shewes guylty hart dothe deeme his state opprobrious. Then thow that framest bothe wordes and voyce moste skillfully Yeelde to oure eares a sweete &amp; sounde Relacyon, Yf Love tooke thee by force, or caughte thee guylefully: Dorus. Yf Sunnye Beames shame Heavenly habitatyon, Yf Three leaved grasse seeme to the Sheepe unsavery, Then base and sowre ys Loves moste hye vocatyon, Or yf sheepes Cryes can help the Sunnes owne bravery, Then may I hope, my pype may have abillity, To help her prayes, who deckes mee in her slavery. No, No, No wordes enoble self Nobility. As for youre Doubtes, her voyce was yt deceyved mee, Her eyes the force beyonde my possibility. Dicus. Thy wordes, well voyste, well graste, had allmoste heaved mee, Quite from my self to Love Loves Contemplacyon, Till of these thoughtes thy soeden end bereved mee, Go on therefore, and tell us by what fashyon, In thy owne proof hee gettes so straunge possession, And howe possest, hee strengthens the Invasyon? Dorus. Sighte ys his Roote, in thoughte ys his progressyon, His Chyldehood wonder, Prentiship, attention, His youthe Delighte, his Age the sowles oppressyon. Doubt ys his sleepe, hee waketh in Inventyon, Fancy ys his foode, his Cloathing all of Carefullnes, Beuty his Booke, his play Lovers Discention, His eyes are curyous searche, but wylde with warefullnes. His wynges Desyer ofte Clipte with Desperatyon, Largess his handes coulde never skill of sparefullnes, But howe hee dothe by mighte, or by perswasyon, To Conquer and his Conquest howe to ratify, Experyence Doubtes, and Schooles holde Disputatyon. Dicus. But so thy Sheepe may thy good wisshes satisfy, With large encrease, and woolle of fyne perfection, So shee thy Love, her eyes, thy eyes may gratify, As thow wilte give oure sowles a dere refection, By telling how shee was, howe nowe shee framed ys, To help oure hurte in thee her owne infection. Dorus. Blessed bee the Name, wherewith my Mistris named ys, Whose woundes are salves, whose yokes please more then plesure dothe Her staynes are beames vertue the faulte shee blamed ys, The harte, eye, eare, here onely fynde his treasures dothe All Nombring Artes her endles graces nomber not, Tyme, Place, lyfe witt scarcely her rare giftes mesure dothe, Ys shee in rage? So ys the Sunne is Somer hott, Yet harvest bringes, Dothe shee (alas) absent her self? The Sun? ys hidd his kyndely shadowe Combers nott. But when to give some grace shee dothe content her self, O then yt shynes, then are the heavens distributed, And Venus seemes to make up her, shee spent her self, Thus then I say, my myscheefes have contributed, A greater good by her devyne Reflection, My harmes to mee my Bliss to her attributed, Thus shee ys framed, her eyes are my direction, Her Love my Lyfe, her Anger my Instruction, Lastly what so shee bee ys my protection. Dicus. Thy saftye sure ys wrapped in Destruction, For that Construction thy owne wordes do beare, A Man to feare a Womans muddy eye, Or Reason lye, a slave to servyle sence, There seeke defence, where weykenes ys the force, Ys Late Remorse, in folly dearely boughte, Dorus. If I had thoughte, to heare Blaspheymous wordes, My Brest to swordes, My sowle to hell have soulde, I sooner woulde, then thus my eares defyle, With wordes too vyle, whiche vyler breath dothe brede. O Hearde, take heede, for I a wolffe have founde, Who hunting rounde the strongest for to kill, His Chest dothe fill with earthe of others woe, And Loden so, pulles downe, pulde downe destroyes. O Shepeheardes boyes, eschewe these toungues of venym Whiche doo envenym, bothe the Sowle and senses, Oure best Defences, are to flee theyre adders, O tungues, even Ladders, made to clyme Dishonour. Who judge that Honor, whiche hathe scoape to slaunder? Dicus. Dorus, yow wander, farr in greate Reproches, So Love encroaches, in youre charmed reason, But yt ys season, for to ende oure singinge, Suche Anger bringing, as for my fancy In sicke mans franzy, rather takes Compassyon, Then Rage for Rage, rather my wish I send to thee, Thow soone may have some help, or chaunge of passyon, Shee ofte her Lookes the starres theyre favoure bend to thee, Fortune, store, Nature, healthe, Love graunte perswasyon, A Quyet mynde, none but thy self can lend to thee, Thus I commend all oure Former Love. Dorus. Well doo I prove, error lyes ofte in zeale, Yet ys yt zeale, thoughe error of true harte, Noughte coulde Imparte, suche heates to frendly mynde, But for to fynde, thy wordes did her disgrace, Whose onely face, the litle heaven ys, Whiche whoo dothe myss his eyes are but Dilusyons, Barred from his cheefest object of Delightfullnes, Throwne on this earthe the Chaos of Confusyons, As for thy wish, to my enraged spytefullnes, The Lovely blowe with rare Rewarde my prayer ys, Thow mayste Love her, that I may see thy spytefullnes, The quyet mynde wherof my self ympairer ys, As thow doest thincke, shoulde moste of all disquyet mee, Withoute her Love, then any mynde who fayrer ys, Her onely Care, from surfett woes can dyet mee, Shee holdes the Ballance of my Contentacyon, Her cleared lookes (nought ellse) in stormes can quyet mee Nay, rather then my ease, Discontentatyon Shoulde breede to her, Lett mee for aye dejected bee, From my Joye whiche might her greef occasyon, With so sweete plaigues my happy harmes infected bee, Payne willes mee dye, yet payne of Deathe I mortify, For thoughe lyfe yrckes, in lyfe my Loves protected bee, Thus for eche Chaunge, my Chaungeles harte I fortify. [And are yow there oulde Pas? in trouthe I ever thoughte] Nico. Pas. Dicus. Nico. And are yow there oulde Pas? in trouthe I ever thoughte, Amongst us all wee should fynde oute some thing of noughte. Pas. And I am here the same, so mote I thryving bee, Dispayrde, in all this flock, to fynde a knave, but thee, Nico. A, nowe I see why thow arte in thy self so blynde? Thy gray hoode hydes the thinge that thow dispayrst to fynde. Pas. My gray hood ys myne owne, all bee yt bee but graye, Nott as the scripp thow stolest while Dorus sleeping lay. Nico. Myne was the scripp but thow that seeming rayed w?? Love, Did snatche from Hyppas hand her greeny wroughten glove, Pas. Ah foole, so Courtyers doo, but, who did lyvely skipp? When for a Treene dish stollen the father did thee whipp, Nico. In deed the witche thy Dame her Crouche from shoulder spredd, For pillfering Lalus lambe w?? Crouche to bless thy hedd. Pas. My voyce the Lambe did wyn?, Menalchas was the Judge, Of singing Matche wee made, when hee w?? shame did trudge, Nico. Couldest thow make Lalus flee, so Nightingales avoyde, When with the Cawyng Crowes theyre musick ys anoyde, Pas. Na, like to Nightingales, the other byrdes give eare, My pype and songe made hym bothe songe &amp; pype forsweare. Nico. I thincke yt well suche voyce woulde make one Musick hate, But yf I had bene there thaddst founde an other Mate. Pas. An other sure as ys a Gander from a Goose, But still when thow doest singe mee thinckes a Coulte ys loose. Nico. Well aymed by my hatt, for as thow sangest last day, The Neighboures all did crye, Alas what Asse dothe bray, Pas. But here ys Dicus oulde, Lett hym then speake the worde, To whither with best Cause the Nymphes fayre flowers afforde, Nico. Content, but I will Lay a wager thereunto, That, proffett may ensue to hym that best can doo. I have, and longe shall have a white greate Nymble Catt, A Kinge uppon a Mowse a strong foe to a Ratt. Fyne eares, Longe tayle hee hathe with lyons curbed Clawe, Whiche ofte hee lifteth up and stayes his lifted pawe. Deepe musing to hym self, w?? (after mewyng) showes, Till with likt berde his eye of fyer, espyes his foes. Yf yow (alas pore yf) doo wyn?, then wyn? yow this, And yf I better singe lett mee thy Hyppa kisse. Pas. Kisse her, now mayste thow kiss, I have a fitter Matche, A prity Curr yt ys, his name, I wus ys Catche. No eare nor taile hee hathe, least they shoulde hym disgrace, A Ruddy hayer his Coate with fyne longe speckled face Hee never musing standes, but, with hym self will playe, Leaping at every flee, and angry with a Flea. Hee efte woulde kill a Mouse, but hee disdaynes the feighte, And makes oure home good sporte w?? dauncing bolte uprighte, This ys my Pawne, the pryce, let Dicus Judgment showe, Suche Oddes I willing laye, for hym and yo? I knowe. Dicus. Singe then my Laddes, and singe, w?? better vayne, then yett, Or else with singing worse, my skill may hardly hitt. Nico. Who doubtes but Pas fyne pype, ageane will bringe, The auncyent prayse to Arcadia Shepeheardes skill, Pan ys not deade synce Pas begyns to singe. Pas. Who ever more will love Appollos quyll? Synce Nico dothe to singe, so wydely gape, Nico his place farr better furnish will. Nico. Was this not hee, who for Siringas scape, Raging in woes, first pastors tought to play, Do yow not heare his voyce, and see his shape. Pas. This ys not hee, that fayled her to gayne, (Whiche made a Bay) made Bay a holly tree But this ys one that doth his Musick stayne. Nico. O Faunes, O Fayries all, and doo yow see? And suffer suche a wronge, a wronge, I trowe, That Nico must with Pas compared bee. Pas. O Nymphes, I tell yow newes, for Pas yow knowe, Whyle I was warbling oute youre wonted prayse, Nico woulde needes with Pas his baggpype blowe. Nico. Yf never I did fayle youre holy dayes, With Daunces, Carrolls, or with Barley breake, Let Pas now knowe how Nico maketh layes. Pas. Yf eche day hathe bene holly for youre sake, Unto my Pype, O Nymphes now help my pype, For Pas well knowes what Layes can Nico make. Nico. Alas, howe ofte I looke on Cheryes rype, Mee thinckes I see the Lippes my Leuca hathe, And wanting her, my weeping eyes I wype. Pas. Alas when I in springe mete Roses rathe, And thinck from Hyppas sweete redd Lippes I live, I leave my eyes unwypte, my Cheekes to bathe, Nico. As I of late, nere Busshes used my sive, I spyde my Thrush, where shee did make her Nest, That will I take, and to my Leuca give. Pas. But, longe have I a Sparrowe gayly drest As white as Milke, and comming to the Calle, To putt yt with my hande in Hyppas brest. Nico. I ofte doo sue, and Leuca saythe, I shall, But, when I did come nere with heate and hope Shee ranne away, and threwe at mee a Balle. Pas. Hyppa once sayde, shee lefte the wickett ope, For mee to come, and so shee did, I came, But in the place founde no thinge, but a Rope. Nico. When Leuca dothe appeare, the Sunne for shame, Dothe hyde hym self, for to hym self hee sayes, Yf Leuca live, shee darcken will my fame, Pas. When Hyppa dothe come forthe, the Sunne displayes, His uttmoste Lighte, for well his witt dothe knowe, Hyppas fayre Beames emblemish muche his Rayes. Nico. Leuca to mee, did yester morninge shewe, In perfect Lighte, whiche coulde mee not deceyve, Her naked Legg, more whyte then snowe. Pas. But, yester nighte by Lighte I did receyve, From Hyppas eyes w?? full in Darckenes shyne, I sawe her Arme, where purest Lillyes cleave. Nico. Shee once starcke nakte did bathe a litle tyne, But still mee thoughte with Beutyes from her fell Shee did the water washe and make more fyne. Pas. Shee once to coole her self stoode in a well, But ever synce, that well ys well besoughte, And for Rose water soulde of rarest smell. Nico. To Rivers bancke, beeyng a wallking broughte, Shee bid mee spye her Baby in the brooke, Alas sayde I, this Babe dothe nurse my thoughte. Pas. As in a glasse I helde, shee once did looke, I sayde my handes well payde her for myne eyes, Synce in my handes self goodly sighte shee tooke. Nico. O yf I had a Ladder for the skyes, I woulde clyme upp and bringe a prety starr, To weare uppon her neck that open lyes. Pas. O yf I had Appolloes golden Carre, I woulde come downe, and yeelde to her my place, That shyning now shee then might shyne more farr. Nico. No thinge O Leuca, shall thy fame deface, Whyles Shepeheardes Tunes bee hearde or Rhymes bee redd, Or while that Shepeheardes love a Lovely face, Pas. Thy Name O Hyppa shall with prayse bee spredd As farr as any Shepeheardes pyping bee. As farr as Love possesseth any hedd. Nico. Thy Monument ys layde in many a Tree, With Name engraved so thoughe thy body dye, The after Folckes shall wonder still at thee. Pas. So ofte these woodes have hearde my Hyppa crye, That after deathe, to heaven in woodes resounde, With Ecchos help shall Hyppa, hippa flye. Nico. Peace, peace good Pas, thow wearest eeven the grounde, With sluttish songe, I pray thee learne to blea? For, good thow mayest yet prove in Sheepish sounde. Pas. My father hathe at home a prety Jay, Goo wynne of hym for chattering prayse or shame, For so yet of a Conquest, speake thow may. Nico. Tell mee, (and, bee my Pan) the Monsters name? That hathe fowre Legges and with twoo onely goes? That hathe fowre eyes, and onely Twoo can frame? Pas. Tell this (and Phebus bee,) what Monster growes? With so strange Lyves, that body can not rest? In ease, untill that body lyfe forgoes? Dicus. Inuff, inuff, so evell hathe done the best, That since the having of them to neyther ys due, Lett Catt and Dogg feight whiche shall have bothe yow. [As I behynde a Busshe did sitt] Histor. As I behynde a Busshe did sitt, I sylent hearde more Wordes of witt, Then earst I knew, but first did playne, The one whiche tother woulde refrayne. [Alas how longe this Pillgrimage dothe last] Plangus. Boulon. Plangus. Alas how longe this Pillgrimage dothe last, What greater evills have now the Heavens in store? To cupple co?yng harmes with sorrowes past, Longe synce my voyce ys hoarse, and throate ys sore With Cryes to skyes, and Curses to the grounde, But, more I playne, I feele my woes the more. Ah where was first, that Crewell Cunning founde, To frame of earthe a vessell of the mynde Where yt shoulde bee the self destruction bounde, What needed so hye spirites suche Mansions blynde? Or wrapt in flessh, what doo they here obtayne? But gloryous Name of wretched humane kynde, Balles to the starres, and Thralles to fortunes raigne, Turned from them selves infected with theyre Cage Where deathe ys fearde, and lyfe ys helde w?? payne, Lyke Players placed to fill a filthy stage, Where Chaunge of thoughtes one foole to other shewes And all but Jestes, save onely sorowes rage? The Chylde feeles that the Man that feeling knowes, With Cryes first borne, the presage of his lyfe, Where witt butt serves to have true taste of woes, A Shopp of shame, a Booke where Blottes are ryfe, This Body ys, this Body so composde, As in yt self, to nourish mortall stryfe. So dyvers bee the Elementes disposde, In this weyke worcke, that yt can never bee, Made uniforme to any estate reposde, Greef onely makes his wretched state to see, Even lyke a Topp, w?? noughte, but whipping mooves, This Man, this talking beaste, this walking Tree. Greef ys the Stone whiche fynest Judgment prooves, For, who greeves not hathe but a blockish brayne, Synce Cause of greef, no Cause from lyfe remooves, Boulon. Howe longe wilt thow with monefull Musick stayne? The Cherefull Notes, these pleasaunt places yeelde, Where as good happes a perfect state meynteyne. Plangus. Curste bee good happes, and Curst bee they that buylde, Theyre hopes on happes, and do not make dispayre, For all these certeyne Blowes, the surest sheelde, Shall I that sawe Eronas shyning hayre? Torne with her handes, and those same handes of snowe, With Losse of purest blood, them selves to teare. Shall I that sawe those Brestes, where Beutyes flowe Swelling with sighes made pale, w?? myndes diseaze And sawe those eyes (those sunnes) suche showers to showe Shall I whose eares her mornefull wordes do seaze, (Her wordes in Syrop layde of sweetest breathe) Relent those thoughtes w?? then did so displease. No, no, Dispayre, my daily Lesson sayeth, And saythe allthoughe I seeke my Lyfe to flye, Plangus must live to see Eronas deathe, Plangus must live some help for her to trye, Thoughe Dispayre (for love so forceth mee) Plangus dothe Lyve, and shall Erona dye? Erona dye? O heaven, yf heaven there bee, Hathe all the whirling Course so smalle effect? Serve all thy Starry eyes this shame to see, Lett Doltes in haste some Alters fayre erect, To those hye powers w?? idely sitt above, And vertue doo in greatest neede neglect. Boulon. O Man take heede, how thow the goddes do moove, To Causefull Wrathe, whiche thow canst not resist, Blaspheymous wordes the Speaker vayne dothe prove, Alas, whyle wee are wrapt in Foggy Myst, Of oure self Love, (so passyons doo deceyve) Wee thincke they hurte, where moste they doo assist. To harme us wormes, shoulde they by Justice leave, His Nature, nay, hym self for so yt ys, What glory from oure Losse can wee receyve, But still oure daseled eyes theyre way do myss, Whyle that wee doo at his sweete scourge repyne, The kyndely way to beate us on to bliss. Yf shee must dye then hathe shee lost the lyne, Of loathsome dayes, whose losse how canst thow mone, That doest so well theyre myseryes defyne, But, suche wee are with inward Tempest blowne, Of wyndes cleane Contrary, in waves of will, Wee moane that Losse, (w?? had) wee did bemone. Plangus. And shall shee dye, shall crewell fyer spill? Those Beames that sett so many hartes on fyer. Hathe shee not force eeven deathe with Love to kyll, Nay, eeven coulde Deathe enflamde with whott desyer? Her to enjoy, where Joy yt self ys thralle? Will spoyle the Earthe of his moste riche attyre. Thus, Deathe becomes a Rivall to us all, And hopes with fowle embracementes her to gett, In whose decay, vertues fayre shryne must falle, O vertue weyke, shall Deathe his Tryumphe sett? Uppon thy spoyles whiche never shoulde lye waste Lett Deathe first dye, bee thow his worthy Lett. By what Eclips shall that Sunne bee defaste? What Myne hathe earst throwne downe so fayre a Tower? What Sacriledg hathe suche a Sainte disgraste? The worlde the garden ys, shee ys the Flower? That sweetens all the place, shee ys the guest, Of rarest pryce, bothe heaven &amp; earth her Bower. And shall (O, mee) all this in Asshes rest? Alas yf yow a Phenix now will have, Burnt by the Sunne, shee first must buyld her Nest, But well yo? knowe, the gentle Sunne woulde save, Suche Beames so like his owne w?? mighte have Myghte, In him the thoughtes of Phaetons Da? to grave. Therefore alas, yo? use vyle Vulcans spyte, Whiche nothing spares to melt that virgin waxe, Whiche while yt ys, yt ys all Asias lighte, O Mars for what dothe serve thy armed Axe, To let that witoulde Beast consume in flames, Thy Venus Chylde, whose Beuty Venus lackes. O Venus, yf her prayse, no Envy frames, In thy hye mynde gett her thy husbandes grace, Sweete speaking ofte, a Currish harte reclaymes, O Eyes of myne, where once shee sawe her face, (Her face whiche was more lyvely in her hart) O Brayne, where thoughte of her hathe onely place? O hande w?? tuched her hande when wee did parte, O Lyppes that kist that hand with my Teares sprent. O Toungue then dumbe, not daring tell my smarte, O Sowle whose Love, in her ys onely spent? What ere yow see thincke, tuche, kisse, speake or Love, Let all for her, and unto her bee bent. Boulon. Thy wayling wordes doo muche my Spirites moove, They uttered are in suche a feeling fashion, That sorowes worcke ageanst my will I prove, Mee thinckes I am partaker of youre passyon, And in thy Case do glasse myne owne debility, Self guylty folcke, must proove to feele Compassyon. Yet Reason saythe, Reason shoulde have hability, To holde these worldly thinges in suche proportion, As let them come or goo with even facility. But, oure Desyers Tyrannicall extortion, Dothe force us there, to sett oure cheef Delightfullnes, Where, but a Bayting place, ys all oure portion. But still allthoughe wee faile of perfect Rightfullnes, Seeke wee to tame these Chyldish Superfluityes, Let us not wincke, thoughe voyde of purest sightfullnes. For, what can breede more peevish Incongruityes, Then Man to yeelde to female Lamentacyons. Let us some Gra?er learne of oure Congruityes? Plangus. Yf throughe myne eares perse any Consolacyons, By wyse Discourse, sweete Tunes or Poettes fiction, Yf oughte I cease these Odyous exclamacyons, Whyle that my sowle, shee shee Lives in affliction, Then lett my Lyfe on earthe longe tyme maynteyned bee, To wretched mee, the last worste Malediction. Can I that knewe her sacred partes restrayned bee? From any Joye, knowe fortunes vyle displacing her? In morrall Rules, Lett raging woes conteyned bee, Can I forgett, when they in prison placing her, With swelling hart in spyte, and due Disdeynfullnes, Shee lay for Deade, till I helpt with unlasing her. Can I forgett from howe muche mourning playnfullnes? With Dyamond in wyndow glasse shee graved Erona dye, and ende this ougly paynefullnes, Can I forgett, in how strange phrase shee craved? That quickly they woulde her burne downe or smother. As yf by deathe shee onely mighte bee saved. Then lett mee eke forgett my hande from other, Lett mee forgett that Plangus I am called, Lett me forgett I am sonne to my Mother, But, yf my memory thus must bee thralled, To that straunge stroke w?? conquerd all my sences, Can thoughte still thincking so rest unappalled? Boulon. Who still dothe seeke ageanst hym self Offences, What pardon can avayle, or who employes hym? To hurt hym self what sheeldes can bee defences. Woo to pore Man, eche owteward thing anoyes hym, In dyvers kyndes, yet, as hee were not filled, Hee heapes in Inward greef, that moste destroyes hym. Thus ys oure Thoughte (with payne) for Thistells tilled, Thus bee oure noblest partes dryed up with sorrowe, Thus ys oure mynde, with too muche mynding spilled, One daye layes up store of greef for the morowe. And whose good happ dothe leave hym unprovyded Condoling Cause, of Frendship hee will borrowe. Betuixt the good, and shade of good denyed, Wee pity deeme that, whiche but weykenes ys, So are wee from oure hye Creation slyded, But Plangus leste I may youre sicknes mysse, Or Rubbing hurt the sore I here do ende, The Asse did hurt when hee did thincke to kisse. Thus did they say, and then away did wende, Hye tyme for mee, for scattered were my Sheepe, While I theyre speeche in my Rude Ryming pend, Yet for that Nighte my Cabban did them keepe, Whyle Plangus did a Story straunge declare, But, hoarse and Drye, my Pypes I now must spare.

Or doest thow thincke that heare Ys lefte a Sunne, whose Beames thy place may use, Yet stay, and well peruse, What bee her giftes, that make her Ã¦quall thee, Bend all thy Lighte to see, In Earthly Clothes enclosed a Heavenly sparcke, Thy Ronning Course can not suche Beutyes marck. No, No, thy motyons bee Hastened from us with Barr of shadowe darck, Bycause that thow the Author of thy sighte, Disdaynes wee see, thee stayned with others Lighte. [O, Stealing tyme, the Subject of Delay] O, Stealing tyme, the Subject of Delay, Delay the rack of unrefraynde Desyer, What straunge desyer, haste thow my hopes to stay?

Thy Mistris Songe ys now a Sorowes Crye, Her hande benomde with Fortunes dayly blowes. Her mynde amasde can neythers help apply, Weare these my wordes, as Mourning weedes of woes? Black Incke become the State wherein I Dye. And thoughe not my moanes bee not in Musick bounde Of written greefes yet bee the sylent grounde.

Thus Noble golde downe to the bottome goes, When worthles Corck alofte dothe floating lye. Thus in thy self, Leste stringes are Lowdest founde, And Lowest Stoppes doo yeelde the highest sounde.

[The Love whiche ys imprinted in my sowle] The Love whiche ys imprinted in my sowle, With Bewtyes sealle and vertue fayre disguysde, With Inward Cryes puttes forthe a bitter Rowle, Of huge Complayntes, that nowe yt ys despysde, Thus thus, the more I Love, the wronge the more, Monstruous appeares, Long truthe receyved late, Wrong sturres remorced greef, greefes deadly sore, Unkyndenes breedes, unkyndenes fostereth hate. But ah, the more I hate, the more I thincke, Whome I doo hate, the more I thinck on hym, The more his Matcheles giftes doo deepely sincke, Into my Brest, and Loves renewed swy?, What Medicyn then can suche Disease remoove? Where Love drawes hate, and hate engendereth Love. [What Toungue can her perfections tell?] What Toungue can her perfections tell? In whose eche parte all pen?s may dwell. Her hayre fyne Laces made of golde, In Curled knottes Mans thoughte to holde, But that her forehead sayes in mee, A whiter Bewty yow may see, Whiter in deede, more white then snowe, Whiche on Colde wynters face dothe growe. That dothe present those prety Browes, Whose equall Lynes theyre Angles bowes, Lyke to the Moone when after Change, Her Horned face in Heaven dothe Range, And Arches bee to those fayre Lyddes, Whose wincke eche Bolde attempt forbiddes. As for the Starres, whose spheares contayne The Matcheles prayse even prayse dothe stayne, No Lampe whose Lighte by arte ys gott, No Sunne whiche shynes and seeth nott, Can Liken them withoute all pere, Save one asmuche as other Clere. Whiche onely thus unhappy bee, Bycause them selves they can not see, Her Cheekes with kyndly Clarett spredd Like Christall, underlayde with Redd, Her Nose and Chyn? suche Ivory weares, No Elephant so perfect beares. But who those Ruddy Lippes can mysse, Whiche Blessed still them selves do kisse, Rubyes, Cheryes, and Roses newe, In worthe, in Taste, in perfect Hewe, Whiche never parte but that they showe, Of precyous partes the Duble Rowe, The second sweetely fenced warde, Her hevenly dewed Toungue to garde. Whence never worde in vayne dothe flowe, Fayre under these dothe stately growe, The handle of this pleasaunt worcke, The Neck in whiche strange graces lurcke, Suche bee I thincke the sumptuous Towers, Whiche skill dothe make in Princely Bowers. So true a Taste invites the Eye, A litle Downeward to espye, The Lovely Clusters of her Brestes, Of Venus Babb the wanton Nestes, Lyke Pummells Rounde of Marble Clere, Where Azured vaynes well mixte appeare, With Lycoras stalkes of Porphiry, Betwixt these Twoo a way dothe lye, A way, more worthy Beutyes fame, Then that w?? beares the Milcken Name, These Leades unto the Joyous feelde, Whiche onely still dothe Lillyes yeelde. But Lillyes suche, whose Native smell The Indyan Odoures doo excell. Waste yt ys callde, for, yt dothe waste, Menns Lyves untill yt bee embraste, There may one see, and yet not see, Her tender Ribbes well armed bee, Like Whitest Snowe, in silver Brooke, Fayre, thorow fayre strykes of heedefull Looke. In these Delightes the Wandering thoughte, Mighte of eche syde a stray bee broughte, But, that her Navell dothe unite, The Curyous Circle buysy sighte, A Daynty sealle of virgyn waxe, Where no thing but Impressyon lackes. The Belly theyre glad sighte dothe fyll, Justly entituled Cupids Hill. A Hill moste fitt for suche a Master, A spottles Myne of Alablaster; Lyke Alablaster fayre and slyke, But softe and supple, Sattyn like, For, suche an use the worlde hathe gotten, The best thinges still must bee forgotten. Yet never shall my Songe, omitt, Those thighes for Ovids songe more fitt, Whiche flancked with twoo sugred flanckes, Lifte up theyre stately swelling Banckes, That Albyon Cleeves in whitenes passe, With hanches smoothe as Looking glasse. But, bowe all knees, now of her knees, My toungue dothe tell what fancy sees, The knottes of Joye, the Gynnes of Love, Whose motyon makes all graces moove, Whose boughte enchaynde dothe yeeld suche sighte, Like Cunning paynters shadowyng white, The gartering place dothe Chyldelike signe, Shewes easy Printe in Mettall fyne. But, there ageane, the flesh dothe ryse, In her brave Calves, lyke morning skyes, That Limittes have in smallest smalle, Whose eeven descent makes equall falle, There ofte steales oute that Round cleane foote, This Noble Cedars precyous Roote. In shewe and sente pale vyolettes Whose stepp on earthe all Beuty settes, But, Back unto her Back my Muse, Where Ledas Swann his fethers [mewes], Alonge whose Ridge suche Bones are mett Lyke Comfettes Rounde in Marchepane sett. Her shoulders bee like twoo white Doves, Pearching uppon square Royall Rooves Whose gentle rayes suche Luster fynde, Lyke thynnest Lawne with Tynsell lynde, And thence those Armes deryved are, The Phenix wynges bee not so Rare. For faulteles lengthe, and stayneles Hewe, Ah, woe ys mee, my woes Renewe, Nowe Course dothe Leade mee to her hande, Of my first Love, the fatall Band, Where whitenes dothe for ever sitt, Nature her self enameld yt. For, there with straunge Compact dothe lye, Warme snowe, moyste perle, softe Ivory, There falle those Saphyre Coloured Brookes, Whiche Conduyt like with Curyous Crookes, Sweete Ilandes makes in that sweete Lande, As for the fyngers of the Hande, The Bloody shaftes of Cupids warr, With Amatistes they headed are. Thus hathe eche parte his Bewtyes parte, But, howe the Graces doo Imparte, To all her Lymmes especiall grace, Becomming every tyme and place Whiche dothe even Buty butify, And moste bewitche the wretched ey. Howe all this ys but a fayre Inne, Of fayrer Guest whiche dwelles therein, Of whose hye prayse, and praysefull Blisse Goodnes the penn, Heaven Paper ys, The Incke Immortall fame dothe lende, As I beg?n, so must I ende, No toungue can her perfections tell, In whose eche parte all pennes may dwell. Here endes the Thirde Booke or Acte. THE THIRDE EGLOGUES. [Lett Mother Earthe, now deck her self in flowers] Lett Mother Earthe, now deck her self in flowers, To see her Ofspring seeke a good encrease, Where justest Love dothe vanquish Cupids powers, And Warre of thoughtes ys swallowed up in peace, Whiche never may decrease: But like the Turtles fayre Live One in Twoo, a well united payre, Whiche, that no Chaunce may stayne, O Hymen longe theyre Cupled joyes mentayne. O Heaven awake, shewe forthe thy stately face, Lett not these slombering Clowdes thy Beutyes hyde, But with thy Cherefull presence help to grace, The honest Brydegrome and the basshfull Bryde, Whose loves may ever byde. Like to the Elme and Vyne, With mutuall embracementes them to twyne, In whiche delightfull payne, O Himen, long theyre Cupled Joyes mentayne. Yee Muses all whiche Chaste effectes allowe, And have to Lalus shewed youre secrett skill, To this Chaste Love your sacred favoures bowe, And so to hym and her youre giftes distill, That they all Vyce may kill, And like as Lillyes Pure, Do please all eyes and spottles do endure, Where, that, all Blisse may Raygne O Himen long theyre Cupled Joyes mentayne. Yee Nymphes whiche in the Waters empyres have, Since Lalus Musick ofte dothe yeelde yo? prayse, Graunt to the thinge w?? we for Lalus crave Lett one tyme (but longe firste) Close upp theyre dayes, One grave theyre bodyes sease And like to Rivers sweete, When they through dyvers do togethers meete, One streame bothe streames conteyne, O Himen long theyre Cupled Joyes mentayne. Pan, father Pan, the god of silly Sheepe, Whose Care ys Cause that they in nomber growe, Have muche more Care of them w?? them do keepe Synce from these good, the others good dothe flowe. And make theyre Issue showe, In nomber like the hearde, Of younglinges w?? thy self with love hast reard Or like the Droppes of Rayne, O Himen longe theyre Cupled Joyes mentayne. Vertue (yf not a God) yet Goddes cheefe parte, Bee thow the Knott of this theyre open vowe, That still hee bee her heade, shee bee his harte, Hee cleave to her, shee unto hym do bowe.

But thow fowle Cupid, syer, to Lawless lust Bee thow farre hence with thy impoysoned Darte, Which thoughe of glittering golde shall here take Rust, Where simple Love, whiche Chastenes dothe imparte, Avoydes the hurtfull Arte That needing Charming still, Suche myndes w?? sweete affections for to kill Whiche beeyng pure and playne, O Himen long theyre Cupled Joyes mentayne. All Churlish wordes, shrewde answers, Crabbed Lookes, All privatenes self seeking Inward spite, All waywardnes w?? nothing kyndely brookes, All stryfe for Toyes and Clayming Masters Righte, Bee hence ay putt to flighte, All sturring Husbandes hate, Geanst Neighboures good for womanysh debate Bee fledd, as thinges moste vayne, O Himen longe theyre Cupled Joyes mentayne. All Peacockes pryde, and frutes of Peacockes pryde, Longing to bee with losse of Substance gay, With Recklessnes what may thy howse betyde, So that yowe may on her sure slippers stay For ever hence away. Yet lett not Sluttery, The Sincke of filthe bee Counted huswyfry, But keeping wholesome meane, O Himen long theyre Cupled Joyes meyntayne. But above all away vyle Jelosy, The evill of evills just Cause to bee unjust Howe can hee Love suspecting Treachery? Howe can shee Love where Love can not wynn trust?

The Earthe ys deckt with flowers, the Heavens displayed, Muses graunt giftes; Nymphes longe and joyned lyfe, Pan, store of Babes, Vertue theyre thoughtes well stayde, Cupids Lust g?n, and, gonn ys bitter stryffe, Happy Man, Happy Wyfe, No pryde shall them oppress, Nor yet shall yeeld to Lothsome sluttishnes, And Jelosy ys slayne, For Himen will theyre Cupled Joyes mentayne. [A Neighboure myne, not longe agoo there was] A Neighboure myne, not longe agoo there was, (But Nameless hee, for Blameless hee shall bee) That marryed had a Trick and Bony Lass, As in a Somer day a Man mighte see, But hee hym self a fowle unhandsome groome, And farr unfitt to holde so good a Rowme, Nowe whether mooved with self unworthynes, Or whether Beuty fitt to make a pray, Fell Jelosy did so his Braynes oppress, That yf hee absent were but half a day, Hee gest the worst, (yo? wott what ys the worste) And in hym self newe Doubting Causes nurste. While thus hee fearde, the silly Innocent, Who yet, was good, bycause shee knewe none yll, Unto his Howse a Jolly Shepeheard went, To whome oure Prince did beare a great good will, Bycause in Wrastling and in Pastorall, Hee farr did passe the rest of Shepeherdes all, And therefore hee a Courtyer was benamed, And as a Courtyer was with Chere receyved, (For they have toungues to make a pore man blamed) Yf hee to them his Duety mysconceyved, And for this Courtyer shoulde well like this Table, The goodman bad his wyfe bee servisable. And so shee was, and all with good Intent, But fewe dayes past, while shee good maners usde, But that her Husband thought her service bent, To suche an ende, as hee mighte bee abusde, Yet, like a Coward, fearing Straungers pryde, Hee made the simple wenche his worthe abyde. With Clumpish Lookes, harde wordes and secrett Nippes, Grumbling at her when shee his kyndenes soughte, Asking her howe shee tasted Courtyers Lippes, Hee forste her thincke, that w?? shee never thoughte, In fyne yt made her gess there was some sweete, In that w?? hee so fearde that shee shoulde meete. When once this entred was in womans harte, And that yt had inflamde a newe desyer, There rested then to play a Womans parte, Fwell to seeke, and not to quenche the fyer, But, for his Jelous eye shee well did fynde, Shee studyed Cunning, howe the same to blynde. And thus shee did, one day to hym shee came, And (thoughe ageanst his will) on hym shee leande, And oute gan Crye, ah, well away, for shame, Yf yow help not oure Wedlock will bee staynde, The goodman starting askte what did her moove, She sighed and sayde the bad guest sought her love. Hee litle looking that shee shoulde Complayne, Of that whereto hee fearde shee was enclynde, Bussing her ofte, and in his harte full fayne, Hee did demaunde what Remedy to fynde, Howe they might gett that Guest from them to wende, And yet the Prince (that loved hym) not offend. Husband, (quoth shee) goo to hym by and by, And tell hym that yow fynde I do hym love, And therefore pray hym, that of Curtesy, Hee will absent hym self least hee shoulde moove, A younge Gyrles hart, to that were shame for bothe, Whereto, yow knowe, this Honest harte were Lothe, Thus shall yow shewe, that hym yow doo not Doubte, And as for mee, (sweete Husband) I must beare. Gladd was the Man when hee had hearde her oute, And did the same, allthoughe with mickle feare, For feare hee did, least hee the young man mighte, In Choller putt, with whome hee woulde not feighte. The Courtly Shepehearde muche agast at this, Not seeynge earste suche Token in the wyfe, Thoughe full of scorne woulde not his Duty miss, Knowyng, that evell becomes a Howseholde stryffe Did goo his way, but sojournd nere there, by, That yet, the grounde therof hee mighte espy, The wyfe thus having settled Husbandes Brayne, Who woulde have sworne his wyfe Diana was, Watched when shee a furder poynte mighte gayne, W?? Litle tyme did fittly bringe to pass, For, to the Courte her Man was calde by name, Whether hee needes must goo for feare of blame. Three dayes before that hee must sure departe; Shee written had (but in a hand disguysde) A Letter suche whiche mighte from eyther parte, Seeme to proceede, so well yt was devysde, Shee sealled yt first, then shee the sealling brake, And to her Jelous husband did yt take. With weeping eyes, her eyes shee toughte to weepe, Shee tolde hym that the Courtyer had yt sent, Alas (quoth shee) thus woemens shame dothe Creepe. The goodman Redd on bothe sydes the Content, Yt Tytle had unto my onely Love Subscription was youres moste yf yo? will proove. The Pistle self suche kynde of wordes yt had, My Sweetest Joy the Comfort of my Sprite, So may thy Flockes encrease, thy deare hart glad, So may eche thing (even as thow wisshest) light, As thow wilt digne to reede and gently Reede, This Mourning Incke in w?? my harte dothe bleede. Longe have I Loved, (alas thow worthy arte,) Longe have I Loved (alas Love craveth Love,) Longe have I Loved thy self (alas my harte) Dothe breake, now toungue unto thy Name dothe moove, And thincke not that thy answer, answer ys, But that yt ys my Doome of Bale or Blisse. The Jelous Wretche must nowe to Courte bee g?n, Ne can hee fayle, for Prince hathe for him sent Nowe ys the tyme wee may bee here alone, And give a Longe desyer a sweete Content, Thus shall yo? bothe rewarde a Lover true, And eke revenge his wronge suspecting yow. And this was all and this the Husband Redd, With Chafe ynoughe, till shee hym pacyfyed, Desyering that no greefe in hym bee bredd, Now that hee had her wordes so truely tryed, But that shee woulde to hym the Letter showe, That with his faulte hee might her goodnes knowe. That streight was done, with a many a boysterus threate, That to the Duke hee woulde his synne declare, But now the Courtyer g?n to smell the feate, And with some wordes w?? shewed litle Care, Hee stayed untill the goodman was departed, Then gave hee hym the Blowe w?? never smarted. Thus may yow see the Jelous wreche was made, The Pander of the thinge hee moste did feare, Take heede therefore, how yo? ensue that trade, Least that some Marckes of Jelosy yow beare, For, sure, no Jelosy can that prevent, Whereto twoo partyes once bee full Content. [Who, dothe Desyer that Chaste his wyfe shoulde bee] Who, dothe Desyer that Chaste his wyfe shoulde bee, First, bee hee True, for Truthe, dothe Truthe deserve, Then suche bee hee, as shee his worthe may see, And one man still Credit with her preserve, Not toying kynde, nor Causelesly unkynde, Not sturring thoughtes, nor yet denying Righte, Not spying faultes, nor in playne Errors blynde, Never hard hand, nor never Raynes too lighte. As farr from want, as farr from vayne expense, (The one dothe force, the Later dothe entyse) Allowe good Company, but keeping from thence, All filthy Mowthes, that glory in theyre vyce. Thus done, thow haste no more, but leave y? Rest, To Vertue, Fortune, Tyme and Womans brest. [As I my litle Flock on Ister Bancke] As I my litle Flock on Ister Bancke, (A Litle Flock, but well my Pype they couthe) Did pyping Leade, the Sunne allredy sancke, Beyonde oure Worlde, and ere I gatt my Boothe, Eche thinge with Mantle black, the Night did soothe. Saving the Glowe worme whiche woulde Curteous bee, Of that smalle Lighte ofte watching Sheepeherdes see. The Wellkyn had full nigardly inclosde, In Coffer of Dymme Clowdes his sillver groates, (Yclipped Starres) eche thing to Rest disposde, The Caves were full, the Mountaynes voyde of Goates, The Byrdes eyes closde, closde up theyre Chirping Notes, As for the Nightingale, wood Musick Kinge, (Yt August was) hee daynde not then to singe. Amydd my Sheepe, thoughe I sawe noughte to feare, Yet, (for I no thing sawe) I feared sore, Then founde I whiche thinge ys a charge to beare, For, for my Sheepe I feared mickle more, Then ever for my self, synce I was bore, I satt mee downe, (for so to goo ne coulde) And sange unto my Sheepe, least stray they shoulde. The Songe I sange oulde Languette had mee taughte, Languette the Shepehearde best swifte Ister knewe, For Clerckly reade, and hating what ys naughte, His faythfull harte, Cleane mowthe and handes as trewe, With his sweete skill, my skilless youthe hee drewe, To have a feeling Taste of hym that sittes, Beyonde the Heaven, farre more beyonde oure wittes. Hee sayde the Musick best thilke Powers pleasde, Was Jumpp Concorde betweene oure witt and will, Where Highest notes to godlynes are Raysde, And Lowest sinck not downe to Jott of yll, With oulde true Tales hee wonte my eares to fille, Howe Shepeherdes did of yore, howe nowe they thryve, Spoylling theyre Flock, or while tuixt them they stryve. Hee lyked mee, butt pittyed Lustfull yowthe, His good stronge Staffe my slippery yeares up bore, Hee still hopte well, bycause I Loved truthe, Till forste to parte, with harte and eyes even sore, The worthy Coredens hee gave mee ore, But thus in Okes trewe shade recoumpted hee, Whiche now in Nightes deepe shade Sheepe, hearde of mee, Suche maner tyme there was, what tyme I nott, When all this Earthe this D?m or Moulde of oures, Was onely won'de with suche as Beastes begott Unknowne as then were they that buylden Towers, The Cattell wylde or tame in natures Bowers, Might freely Ronne, or Rest as seemed them. Man was not Man theyre Dwellinges in to hemm, The Beastes had sure some Beastly pollicy, For, no thinge can Indure where order nys; For once the Lyon by the Lambe did lye, The fearefull Hynde the Leoperd did kisse, Hurtles was Tygers pawe, and Serpentes hisse, This thincke I well the Beastes with Corage cladd, Lyke Senators a harmeles Empire had. At whiche whether the others did repyne, (For Envye harboureth moste in feeblest hartes) Or that they all to Chaunging did enclyne, (As even in Beastes theyre D?mes leave Chaunging partes) The Multitude to Jove a Sute impartes, With Naying, Blaying, Braying and Barking, Roaring and Howling, for to have a Kinge. A Kinge, in Language theyres they sayde they woulde, (For then theyre Language was a perfect speeche) The Byrdes likewyse with Chirpes and pyinge coulde, Chackling and Chattering that of Jove beseeche, Onely the Owle warnde them not to seeche So hastely that, whiche they woulde Repent But, sawe they woulde, and hee to Dezertes went. Jove, wysely sayde, (For wysdome wysely sayes) O Beastes take heede what yow of mee desyer, Rulers will thincke all thinges made them to please, And soone forgett the Swincke Due to theyre hyer, But, (synce yow will) parte of my Heavenly fyer, I will yow lende, The Rest youre selves must give, That yt bothe seene and felt may with yo? live. Full glad they were, and tooke the Naked Sprite, Whiche streight the earthe yclothed in his Clay, The Lyon, Harte, the Ounce gave active Mighte, The Horse good shape, The Sparrow Lust to play, Nightingale voyce, entysing Songes to say, Elephant gave a perfect memory, And Parret redy toungue that to apply. The Foxe gave Crafte, the Dogg gave flattery, Asse, patience, the Moulle a worcking thoughte, Ãgle hye Looke, Wolffe secrett Crewelty, Monkye sweete Breathe, the Cowe her fayre eyes broughte, The Ermion whitest skynne spotted with noughte. The Sheepe mylde seeming face, Clyming the Beare, The Stagg did give the harme eschewing feare. The Beare her sleightes the Catt his Melancholy, Ante Industry, and Cony skill to buylde, Cranes Order, Storckes to bee apearing Holy, Cameleon ease to Chaunge, Duck ease to yeelde, Crockadile teares whiche mighte bee falsly speelde, Ape greate thinge gave, thoughe hee did mooving stand, The Instrument of Instrumentes the hand. Eche other Beast lykewyse his present bringes, And (but they Drad theyre Prince they ofte should want,) They all Consented were to give hym winges, And ay more Awe towardes hym for to plante, To theyre owne Worcke this priviledg they graunte, That from thence forthe to all eternity, No Beaste shoulde freely speake, but onely hee. Thus Man was made, thus Man theyre Lorde became, Who at the first wanting or hyding pryde, Hee did to Beastes best use his Cunning frame, With water, Drincke, herbes, meate, and naked hyde, And Fellowlyke lett his Dominyon slyde, Not in his sayinge (saying I.) but Wee.

But when his seate so Rooted hee had founde, That they now skilde not, howe from hym to wende, Then gan in giltles Earthe full many a wounde, Iron to seeke, whiche ageanst yt self shoulde bende, To teare the Bowells that good Corne should sende, But yet the Com?n Dam? none did bemone, Bycause (thoughe hurt) they never heard her grone. Then ga? hee factions in the Beastes to breede, Where helping weyker sorte, the Nobler Beastes, As Tygres, Leoperdes, Beares and Lyons seede, Disdaynd with this in Dezertes soughte theyre Restes, Where famyn, Raven, toughte theyre hongry Chestes, Thus Craftely hee forced them to do yll, Whiche beeyng done hee afterwardes woulde kill. For Murder done, whiche never earst was seene, By those greate Beastes, as for the weykers good, Hee Chose them selves his Guarders for to bee, Geanst those of mighte of whome in feare they stood, As Horse and Dogg not greate but gentle blood, Blythe were the Co?ons Cattle of the Feelde, Tho, when they sawe theyre Foen of greatnes kilde. But, they or spent, or made of sclender mighte, Then quickly did theyre meaner Cattell fynde, The greate Beames go? the Howse on shoulders lighte, For by and by, the Horse fayre Bittes did bynde, The Dogg was in a Collar toughte his kynde, As for the gentle Byrdes like Case mighte Rewe, When Faulcon they and Gosshauke sawe in Mewe. Worste fell to smallest Byrdes, and meanest Hearde, Who now his owne full like his owne hee usde, Yet first but woolle, or Fethers of hee tearde, And when they were well usde to bee abusde, For hongry Throate theyre flessh with Teethe hee brusde At Lengthe for glutton taste hee did them kill, At last for sporte theyre silly Lyves did spill. But, yet, O Man, Rage not beyond thy neede, Deeme yt no prayse to swell in Tyranny, Thow arte of Blood, Joye not to make thinges bleede. Thow fearest Deathe, thincke they are loathe to dye A Playnte of guiltles Hurte dothe pearse the skye, And yow pore Beastes in pacyence byde youre hell, Or know youre strengthes and then yo? shall doo well. Thus did I singe and pype Eighte solempne howers, To Sheepe whome Love, not knowledge made to heare, Now Fancyes Fittes, now Fortunes balefull stowers. But then I homeward Calde my Lambkyns Dere, For to my Dymmed Eyes began to appeare, The Night, growne oulde, her Black heade waxen graye Sure Sheepeheardes signe, that Morne woulde soone fetch day.

[Synce wayling ys a budd of Causefull Sorrowe] Synce wayling ys a budd of Causefull Sorrowe, Synce sorrowe ys the follower of yll Fortune, Synce no yll Fortune equalles publique Damage, Nowe Princess Losse hathe made oure Damage publique, Sorrowe pay wee unto the Rightes of Nature, And Inward greeffe seale up with outeward waylinge. Why shoulde wee spare oure voyce from endles waylinge? Who Justly make oure hartes the seates of Sorowe, In suche a Case, where yt apeares that Nature, Dothe add her force unto the stinge of Fortune, Chosing alas, this oure Theater publique, Where they woulde Leave Tropheys of cruell Damage. Then since suche powers conspire unto oure Damage, Whiche may bee knowne, but never helpt w?? wayling, Yet let us leave a Monument in publique, Of willing teares, torne here, and Cryes of Sorrowe. For lost, lost, ys by Blowe of Crewell Fortune, Arcadias gemme the Noblest Chylde of Nature. O Nature Doting olde, O blynded Nature? Howe haste thow torne thy self, soughte thyne owne Damage? In graunting suche a Scope to filthy Fortune. By thy Impes loss, to fill the worlde with wayling? Cast thy Stepp mother eyes uppon oure Sorowe, Publique oure Loss, to see thy shame ys publick. O that wee had, (to make oure woes more publique) Seays in oure eyes, and brazen Toungues by Nature, A yelling voyce, and Hartes compost of Sorowe, Breathe made of flames with knowing noughte but Damage. Oure Sportes murdering oure selves, oure Musickes wayling Oure studyes fixte uppon the falles of Fortune. No, no, oure myscheef growes in this vyle Fortune, That private panges, can not breathe oute in publique, The furyous Inward greeffes with hellish wayling. But forced are to burden feeble Nature With secrett sence of oure eternall Damage, And sorowe feede feeding oure Sowles with sorowe. Synce Sorowe then concludeth all oure Fortune, With all oure deathes, shewe wee this Damage publique His Nature feares to dye who lives still Wayling. HERE BEGIN THE FOURTHE EGLOGUES.

Klaius. O Mercury, foregoer to the Eevening, O heavenly Huntress of the Savage Mountaynes, O Lovely Starr, entytled of the Morning, (While that my voyce dothe fill these wofull valleys) Vouchsafe youre silent eares to playing Musick, W?? ofte hathe Echo tyred in secrett Forestes. Strephon. I that was once free Burgess of the Forestes (Where shade from Sun? and sporte I sought in Eevening) I that was once esteemd for pleasaunt Musick, And banisht now amongst the Monsterus Mountaynes, Of huge Dispayre and fowle afflictions valleyes, Am growne a Scriche Owle to my self eche morning. Klaius. I that was once delighted every morning, Hunting the wylde Inhabiters of the Forestes, I that was once the Musick of the valleyes, So Darckened am, that all my day ys Eevening, Hart broken so, that Mole hilles seeme hye Mounteynes, And fill the valleyes w?? Cryes in steade of Musick. Strephon. Longe synce, alas, my Deadly Swannish Musick, Hathe made yt self a Cryer of the Morning, And hathe with wayling strengthe clymed hyest Mountaynes, Longe synce my thoughtes more Dezert bee then Forestes, Longe synce I see my Joyes come to theyre Eevening, And State throwne downe to every trodden valleys. Klaius. Longe synce the happy dwellers of these valleyes, Have prayde mee leave my straunge exclaming Musick, Whiche trubles theyre dayes worcke and Joyes of Eevening, Longe since I hate the Nighte, more hate the Morning, Longe synce my thoughtes chase mee like Beastes in Forestes And make mee wish my self layde under Mountaynes. Strephon.

Mee seemes I see a filthy Clowdy Eevening, Assoone as Sun? begyns to clyme the Mountaynes, Mee seemes I feele a Noysome sent the Morninge, When I do smell the Flowers of the valleyes, Mee seemes I heare (when I do heare sweete Musick) The Dreadfull Cryes of Murdered men in Forestes. Strephon. I wish to fyre the trees of all these Forestes, I give the Sunne a Last farewell eche eevening, I Curse the fidling fynders oute of Musick, With Envy I do hate the lofty Mountaynes, And with Despyte do spyte the humble valleyes. I Do detest Nighte, Eevening day and Morning. Klaius. Curse to myself my Prayer ys the Morninge, My fyer ys more then can bee made with Forestes, My estate more base, then ys the basest valleyes, I wish no Eevening, more, to see eche eevening. Shamed, I hate my self in sighte of Mountaynes, And stopp myne Eares lest I growe Madd w?? Musik. Strephon. For shee whose partes meyntayne a perfect Musick, Whose bewtyes shyne more then the blusshing morninge, Who muche did pass in state, the Stately Mountaynes, In streightnes past the Caedars of the forrestes, Hathe cast mee wretche into Eternall Eevening, By taking her twoo Sunnes from these darck valleyes. Klaius. For shee with whome Comparde the Alpes are valleyes, Shee whose Least worde bringes from the Spheares theyre Musick, At whose approche the Sunne rase in the Eevening, Who where shee went bare in her forehead Morning, Ys go? ys go? from these oure spoyled Forestes, Turning to Dezartes oure best pastured Mountaynes. Strephon. These Mountaynes witnes shall, so shall these valleyes, Klaius. These Forestes eeke made wretched by oure Musick, Oure Morning Hymne this ys and Songe at Eevening. Strephon.

Klaius. I thincke from mee, not from my woes to parte, And lo this tyme calde Lyfe may thinck that lyfe, Nature to mee, for Tormentes did imparte, Thinck my hard happes have blunted Deathes sharp knyfe, Not sparing mee in whome his worcke bee ryfe, And thincking this thincke Nature lyfe and deathe, Place, sorowes tryumphe, on my Conquerd hart, Whereto I yeelde, and seeke no other breathe, But from the sent of some infectious grave, Nor of my fortune, oughte but mischeef crave. Strephon. Nor of my Fortune oughte but myscheef Crave, And seeke to nourish that w?? now contaynes, All what I am, yf I my self will save, Then must I save what in mee cheefly raynes, Whiche ys the hatefull webb of sorowes paynes Sorow then Cherish mee for I am Sorowe, No beeyng now but Sorow I can have, Then deck mee as thyne owne, thy help I borowe, Synce thow Joy reckles arte, and that thow haste, Inoughe to make a fertyle mynde lye waste. Klaius. Inoughe to make a fertile mynde lye waste, Ys that huge storme w?? powers yt self on mee, Hayle stones of teares, of Sighes a Monsterus blast, Thunders of Cryes, Lightninges my wylde Lookes bee. The Darckened Heaven my Sowle w?? nought can see, The Flying spirites w??

Strephon. So close unto my self my wrackes do lye, Bothe Cause, Effect beginning and the ende, All are in mee, what help then can I trye My Shipp my self whose Course to Love dothe bend, Sore beaten dothe her mast of Comfort spend Her Cable Reason, breakes from Ancker Hope, Fancy her Tackling, Torne away dothe flye, Rwyn the wynde hathe blowne mee from her scope, Brused with waves of Care, but broken ys On Rock Dispayre the Buryall of my Blisse. Klaius. On Rock Dispayre, the Buryall of my Blisse, I longe do plowe with plowe of Depe Desyer, The seede fast meanyng ys no truthe to misse, I harrowe yt with thoughtes w?? all Conspyre, Favoure to make my Cheef and onely hyer, But woe ys mee the yeare ys go? aboute, And now I fayne woulde reape, I reape but this, Hate fully growne, absence new spronge oute, So that I see allthoughe my sighte empayre, Vayne ys theyre payne, who Laboure in Dispayre. Strephon. Vayne ys theyre payne, who Laboure in Dispayre For so did I when with myne Angle will, I sought to catche the Fish Torpedo fayre Even then Dispayre did hope all redy kill, Yet Fancy wolde perforce employ his skill, And this hathe gott the Catcher now hathe caught Lamed with the Angle w?? yt self did beare, And unto Deathe, quite Drownde in Doloures brought, To Deathe as then Disguysde in her fayre face, Thus, thus, alas I had my Losse in Chace. Klaius. Thus, thus alas, I had my Losse in Chace, When first that Crowned Basilik I knewe, Whose Footsteppes I with kisses ofte did trace, Till (by suche happ, as I must ever Rue) Myne eyes did lighte uppon her shyning Hue, And thus on mee astonisht with her sight, Synce then my hart did Lose hys wonted place, Infected so with her sweete poysons mighte That Leaving mee for Deade to her yt went But ah her flight hathe my Dead Reliques spent. Strephon. But ah her flight hathe my Deade Reliques spent, Her flight from mee, from mee, though Dead to mee, Yet Living still in her while her beames lent, Suche vitall sparck, that her myne eyes might see, But nowe these Living lightes absented bee, (Full Deade before) I nowe to dust should falle But that eternall paynes my sowle have hent, And keepe yt still within this Body thralle. That thus I must while in this Deathe I dwell, In earthly fetters feele a Lasting hell. Klaius. In earthely fetters feele a Lasting hell, Alas, I doo, from w?? to fynde release, I woulde the Earthe, I woulde the Heavens fell, But vayne yt ys, to thincke those paynes shoulde Cease, Wheare lyfe ys Deathe, and Deathe can not bringe peace, O fayre, O onely fayre from thee alas, These fowle moste fowle Desasters to my falle, Since thow from mee, (O mee) O Sun? didst pass. Therefore esteeming all good blessinges Toyes, I joyed in greef and do Detest all Joyes. Strephon. I joy in greef and do Detest all Joyes, But now an ende, O Klaius now an ende, For even the herbes oure hatefull Musick stroyes, And from oure burning Breath the Trees doo bend. [Now was oure Heavenly vaulte deprived of the Lighte] Now was oure Heavenly vaulte deprived of the Lighte With Sunnes Departe, and nowe the Darcknes of the Nighte, Did light those Beamy starres w?? greater light did Darcke, Nowe eche thinge w?? enjoyed that fyery quickning sparcke, Whiche lyfe ys calde were mooved theyre Spirites to repose, And wanting use of eyes, theyre eyes began to Close, And silence sweete eche where with one Consent embraste, (A Musick sweete to one in Carefull Musick plaste) And Mother Earthe now cladd in Morning weedes did breathe, A Dull desyer to kisse the Image of oure Deathe. When I Disgraced wretche, not wretched then did give, My sences suche Release, as they w?? quyett live, Whose braynes boyle not in woes, nor brestes w?? beatinges ake, With Natures prayse are wonte in safty home to take. Farr from my thoughtes was oughte whereto theyre myndes aspire, Who under Courtly pompes do hatche a base desyer. Free all my powers were, from those Captiving snares, W?? Heavenly purest giftes defyle in muddy Cares. Ne coulde my sowle yt self accuse of suche a faulte, As tender Conscyence mighte w?? furyous panges assault, But like the feeble Flower (whose stalke can not sustayne, His weighty Topp) his Topp dothe downeward dropping leane. Or as the silly Byrde in well acquaynted Nest Dothe hyde his heade w?? Cares, but onely howe to Rest. So I in simple Course, and unitangled mynde, Did suffer drowsy liddes myne eyes (then clere) to blynde. And laying downe my heade, did natures Rule observe, Whiche sences up dothe shutt, the senses to preserve. They first theyre use forgatt, then fancy lost theyre force, Till Deadly sleepe at lengthe possest my Living Corse. A Living Corse I lay, but, ah my Wakefull mynde, (W?? made of heavenly stuff, no mortall chaunge dothe bynde). Flewe up with Freer winges, of Flesshly bondage free. And having plaste my thoughtes, my thoughtes thus placed mee, Mee thoughte, nay, sure I was, I was in fayrest wood, Of Samothea Land, a Lande w?? whilome stood, An Honor to the Worlde, while Honor was theyre ende, And while theyre Lyne of yeares they did in vertue spend. But there I was; and there my Callmy thoughtes I fedd, On Natures sweete repast, as helthfull sences ledd. Her giftes my study was, her beutyes were my sporte, My worcke her worckes to knowe, her Dwelling my Resort. Those Lampes of Heavenly fyer to fixed motion bounde, For ever turning Spheres the never mooving grounde. What essence destny hathe yf fortune bee or no, Whence oure Immortall sowles, to mortall Earthe doo flowe. What Lyfe yt ys, and howe that all these Lyves do gather, With owteward Makers force, or like an Inward Father. Suche thoughtes (mee thought) I thought, and straynd my single mynde, Then voyde of nerer Cares, the Depthes of thinges to fynde. Who, Loe, w?? hugest Noyse, suche noyse as Tower makes, When yt (blowne up with myne) a falle of Rwyn takes. Or suche a Noyse yt was, as hyest Thunders sende, Or Canons thunder like all shott together lend. The Moone a sunder rent (O Gods) o pardon mee, That forste w?? greef revayles what greeved eyes did see. The Moone a sonder rent, whereat with sodeyn falle, (More swifte then Faulcons stoope, to feeding Falconers calle). There came a Charyott fayre by Doves and Sparowes guyded Whose stormelike Course stayde not, till hard by mee yt byded I wretche astonisht was, and thought the Deathfull Doome, Of heaven of Earthe of hell of tyme and place was come. But streight there issued forthe twoo Ladyes, (Ladyes sure, They seemde to mee) on whome did wayte a virgyn pure, Straunge were the Ladyes Weedes, yet more unfitt then straunge, The first with Clothes tuckt up, as Nimphes in woodes do Range. Tuckt upp even to the Knees, with Bowe and Arrowes prest, Her Right arme naked was, discovered was her brest. But hevy was her pace, and suche a Maigre cheare, As litle hunting mynde (god knowes) did there appeare. The other had with Arte (more then oure woemen knowe) As stuff ment for the sale sett oute to glaring showe, A wanton womans face, and w?? Curlde knottes had twynde, Her hayer w?? by the help of Paynters Cunning shynde, When I suche guests did see come oute of suche a howse, The Mountaynes great w?? Chylde I thought brought forthe a mowse. But walking forthe, the first, thus to the seconde sayde, Venus come on, (sayde shee) Diana yow are obayde, Those Names abasht mee muche, when those great names I hearde, All thoughe theyre fame (mee seemd) from truth had greatly jarrd. As I thus musing stoode, Diana calde to her, Her wayting Nymphe, a Nymphe, that did excell as farr, All thinges that earst I sawe, as Oryent Perles exceede, That w?? theyre Mother highte, or else theyre silly seede. In Deede a perfect Hue, in deede a sweete Consent, Of all those graces giftes the Heavens have ever lent. And so shee was attyrde, as one that did not pryze, So muche her pereles partes, nor yet coulde them despize. But calde she came apace, a pace wherein did moove, The Band of Beutyes all the litle worlde of Love. And bending humbled eyes (O eyes the Sunne of Lighte) Shee wayted Mistrys will, who thus disclosde her spright Sweete Mira myne (quoth shee) the pleasures of my mynde, In whome of all my Rules the perfect proof I fynde, To onely thee, (thow seest) wee graunt this speciall grace, Us to attend in this moste private tyme and place. Bee silent therefore, nowe, and so bee silent still, Of what thow seest close up in secrett knott thy will. Shee answerd was with looke and well performed behest, And Mira I admirde, her shape, sancke in my brest. But thus with Irefull eyes, and face that shoke with spyte, Diana did begy?: What mooved mee to invite Youre presence, Sister Dere, first to my moovy spheare, And hether now vouchsafe to take with willing eare. I knowe full well yow knowe, what discord long hathe raignd, Betwixt us twoo how muche that discord fowle hathe stainde, Bothe oure estates while eache the other did deprave, Prooff speakes to muche to us, that feeling tryall have. Oure names are quite forgott, oure Temples are Defaste Oure offeringes spoylde, oure Preestes from Preesthood are displaste? Ys this the fruite of stryfe, those thowsand Churches hye, Those thowsand Alters fayre, now in the Dust to lye? In mortall myndes oure myndes but Planetes names preserve, No knee once bowed forsoothe, for them they say wee serve, Are wee theyre Servauntes growne? no Doubt a Noble stay, Celestiall powers to wormes Joves Children serve to play, But suche they say wee bee, this prayse oure Discord bredd, While wee for mutuall stryfe, a stryving passyon fedd. But let us wyser bee, and what fowle discorde brake, Somuche more stronge ageane let safest Concord make. Oure yeares do yet requyer, yow see wee bothe doo feele, The weykning work of tymes for ever whirling wheele. All thoughe wee bee Devyne, oure Graundsire Saturn ys, With ages force decayde, yet once the heve? was his. And now before wee seeke by wyse Appollos skill, Oure younge yeares to renewe (for so hee saithe hee will) Lett us a perfect peace betuixt us twoo Resolve, Whiche lest the Ruynous want of government dissolve, Let one the Princes bee, to her the other yeelde, (For vayne Equality ys but Contentions feelde) And let her have the giftes that shoulde in bothe remayne, In her lett Beuty bothe and Chastenes fully raigne. So as yf I prevayle, yow give youre giftes to mee, Yf yow, on yow I lay, what in my office bee. Now resteth onely this, w?? of us Twoo ys shee, To whome precedentes shall of bothe accorded bee. For that (so that yow like) hereby dothe lye a youthe, (Shee beckened unto mee) as yet of spottless truthe. Who may this Doubt discerne for better witt then Lott Becometh us, in us, Fortune determyns nott. This Crowne of Amber fayre, (an Amber Crowne shee helde) To worthyest lett hym give, when bothe hee hathe beheld. And bee yt as hee saythe, Venus was glad to heare, Suche proffer made w?? shee well shewde w?? smyling chere, As thoughe shee were the same, as when by Paris doome, Shee had cheef Goddesses in beuty overcome. And surely thus gan say, I never soughte debate, Diana dere, my mynde to love and not to hate, Was ever apte, but yo? my pastymes did despyse, I never spyted yow, but thought yo? overwyse. Nowe kyndenes proffered ys, none kynder ys then I, And so moste redy am, this meane of peace to try. And lett hym bee oure Judge: The Ladd dothe please mee well, Thus bothe did come to mee and bothe began to tell. (For bothe, together spake, eche lothe to bee behynde) That they by solempne oathe theyre Deityes wold bynde, To stand unto my will, theyre will they made mee knowe, I that was first agast, when first I sawe theyre shawe (Now boulder waxte) waxt prowde that I suche sway might beare, For, nere acquayntance dothe diminish reverent feare. And having bounde them fast by Stix, they shoulde obay, To all what I decreed, did thus my verdict say. How yll bothe yow can Rule, well hathe youre Discorde taughte, Ne yet, (for oughte I see) youre Beutyes merit oughte. To yonder Nymphe therefore, to Mira, I did poynt, The Crowne above yo? bothe, for ever I appoynt, I woulde have spoken owte but oute they bothe did Crye, Fye, Fye what have wee done, ungodly Rebell fye, But nowe wee must needes yeelde to what oure Oathes requyre, Yet thow shalt not goo free, (quoth Venus) suche a fyer, Her Beuty kyndle shall within thy foolish mynde, That thow full ofte shalt wish thy Judging eyes were blynde, Nay, then (Diana sayde) thee Chastenes I will give, In asshes of Dispayre, though burnt shall make thee live. Nay, thow (sayde bothe) shalt see suche beames shyne in her face, That thow shalt never dare seeke help of wretched Case. And with that Cursed Curse, away to heavens they fledd, First having all theyre giftes uppon fayre Mira spredd. The Rest I can not tell, for therewithall I wakte, And founde with Deadly feare that all my synewes shakte. Was yt a Dreame? O Dreame how haste thow wrought in mee? That I thinges earst unseene, shoulde first in Dreaming see. And then (O Traytor sleepe) made for to bee oure Rest Howe haste thow framde the payne wherewith I am opprest. O Cowarde Cupide thus doest thow thy honor keepe? Unarmde, alas unarmde to take a Man asleepe? [Unto the Caytiff wretche whome long affliction holdeth] Unto the Caytiff wretche whome long affliction holdeth; And now fully beleeves help to bee quyte perisshed. Graunt yet graunt yet a looke to the last monument of his anguish. O, yow (alas so I fynde) Cause of his onely Rewyn. Dread not a whitt (o goodly crewell) that pitty may enter, Into thy hart by the sighte of this Epistle I sende. And so refuse to beholde of these straunge woundes the Recitall, Least yt might thee allure home to thy self to returne, (Unto thyself I do meane those graces dwell so within thee, Gratefullnes, sweetenes, Holylove, Harty regarde,) Suche thinge can not I seeke, Dispayre hathe given mee my answer, Despayre, moste tragicall Clause to a Deadly Request. Suche thinge can not hee hope that knowes thy determinate hardnes, Hard lyfe, a Riche Marble, hard, (but a fayre) Dyamond. Can those eyes (that of eyes drownde in moste harty flowing teares, Teares and Teares of a man had no returne to remorse,) Can those eyes now yeelde to the kynde Conceypt of a Sorowe? Whiche Inck onely Relates, but ne lamentes, ne Replyes, Ah that I do not Conceyve, though that to mee Leefe were More then Nestors yeares, more then a Kinges Dyadem. Ah that I do not conceyve to the Heaven when a Mowse clymes Then may I hope to atcheeve grace of a Heavenly Tygre. But but alas like a Man Condempned dothe crave to bee heard speake, Not that hee hopes for amendes of the Disaster hee feeles. But, fynding thapproche of Deathe with an Inly relenting, Gives an Adieu to the worlde, as to his onely delighte. Right so my boyling harte enflamed w?? fyre of a fayre eye, Bubbling oute dothe breathe signes of his huge doloures Nowe that hee fyndes to what ende his lyfe and love bee reserved And that hee hence must parte, where, to Live, onely I lived, O fayre, O fayrest, are suche the Tryumphes to thy fayrenes? Can Deathe Bewty become? must I bee suche Monument? Must I bee onely the Marck shall proove that Vertue ys angry? Shall prove the fiercenes can with a white Dove abyde? Shall to the worlde appeare, that faythe and Love bee Rewarded? With mortall disdayne bent to unendly Revenge? Unto Revenge, O sweete, on a wretch wilt thow bee Revenged, As the offence ys done? and goo beyonde, yf hee can, All my offence was Love, with Love then must I bee chastened, And with more by the Lawes that to revenge do belonge. Yf that Love bee a faulte, more faulte in yo? to bee Lovely, Love never had mee opprest, but that I sawe to bee Loved, Yow bee the Cause that I love, what reason blameth a shadowe? That with a Body yt goes, synce by a Body yt ys? Yf the Love hate yo? did, yo? shoulde youre Beuty have hidden, Yow shoulde those fayre eyes have w?? a vayle covered. But, Foole, Foole that I am, those eyes wolde shyne from a dark Cave? What vailes then do prevayle, but to a more Mirackle? Or those golden Lockes (those Lockes w?? lock mee to bondage, Torne), yow shoulde disperse unto the blastes of a wynde, But, Foole, Foole that I am, tho I had but a hayer of her hed founde, Eeven as I am, so I shoulde, unto that hayer bee a thrall, Or with a fayre handes nayles (Oh hande w?? nayles mee to deathe) Yo? shoulde have youre face (synce Love ys evell) blemysshed. O, wretche, what did I say, shoulde that fayre face bee defaced? Shoulde my too muche sight cause so true a Sun? to bee lost? First let Cymmerian Darcknes bee my only habitation, First bee myne Eyes pulde oute, first bee my brayne perished Ere I shoulde consent to doo suche excessive a Damage, Unto the Earthe by the hurt of this her heavenly evell. Oh, not. But suche Love yo? say yow coulde have afforded, As mighte learne Temperance voyde of outragius eventes O sweete Simplicity, from whence shoulde Love bee so learned? Unto Cupide that Boy shoulde a pendaunt bee founde? Well, but faulty I was reason to my passyon yeelded, Passyon unto my Rage, Rage to a hasty Revenge? But, whatts this for a fault? for w?? such faithe bee abolished? Suche faythe so stayneless Inviolate, violent. Shall I not Oh may I not thus yet refresh the Remembrance? What sweete Joyes I had once, and what a place I did holde? Shall I not once object that, yo?, yo? graunted a favoure? Unto the Man whome now suche myseryes yo? awarde? Bende youre thoughtes to the Dere sweete wordes w?? then to mee given were. Thincke what a worlde ys now, thinck who hathe altered her hart. What? was I then worthy of suche good? now worthy somuche evell? Now fledd, then cherished, then so nye, now so remote? Did not a Rosed Breathe from Lippes more Rosy proceeding, Say, that I well shoulde fynde in what a Care I was hadd? With muche more: Now, what do I fynde, but Care to abhorr mee? Care, that I sinck in greef, Care, that I live banisshed. And banisshed, doo I live? nor nowe wee seeke a Recovery, Synce so shee will whose will ys to mee more then a Lawe, Yf then a Man in moste evell Case may give yo? a farewell, Farewell, longe Farewell all my wooe all my Delighte. [Since that to deathe ys go? the Shepeheara hye] Since that to deathe ys go? the Shepeheara hye, Who moste the silly Shepeheards pype did pryze, Youre Dolefull Tunes sweete Muses now applye, And yow (O Trees) yf any lyfe there lyes In Trees, nowe throughe youre proved parckes receyve The straunge Resounde of these my Cawsefull Cryes. And lett my Breath uppon youre Braunches cleave, (My Breath distinguisht into wordes of woe) That so I may signes of my sorowes Leave, But yf among your selves some one Tree growe That aptest ys to figure misery, Lett yt (embraced) beare youre greeves to showe. The weeping Mirhe I thincke will not denye, Her help to this, this justest Cause of playnte, Youre Dolefull Tunes sweete Muses now apply, And thow pore Earthe whome fortune dothe attaynt, In natures name to suffer suche a harme, As for to loose thy gemm, or earthly Sainte, Uppon thy face, let Cooly Ravens swarme, Lett all the sea thy teares accoumpted bee, Thy Bowells with all killing Mettals arme. Let golde now Rust lett Dyamondes waste in thee, Let Perles bee wan? with woe theyre Da? dothe beare, Thy self henceforthe the Light do never see, And yow (O Flowers) w?? sometymes Princes were, (Till these Straunge Alteringes yo? did happ to trye,) Of Princes Losse youre selves Foretokens reare, Lilly in Morning black, thy whitenes dye, O Hyacinth lett ai bee on thee still, Youre Dolefull tunes sweete muses now apply O Echo all these woodes with Roaring fill. And do not onely marcke the accentes Last, But all, for all, reache not my wailefull will, One Echo, to an other Echo cast, Sounde of my greeves: and lett yt never ende, Till that yt hathe all woodes and waters past, Nay, to the Heavens youre just Complayninges send, And stay the Starres unconstant Constant race, Till that they do unto oure Doloures bend, And aske the Reason of that speciall grace, That they w?? have no Lyves shoulde live so longe, And vertuous sowles shoulde so soone leave theyre place, Aske yf in great Men, good men so do thronge, That hee (for want of Ellbowe roome must Dye, Or yf that they bee scant) yf this bee wronge, Did wisdome this oure wretched tyme espy? In one true Chest, to Robbe all vertuous treasure, Youre Dolefull Tunes sweete Muses now apply, And yf that any counseile yo? to measure, Youre Dolefull Tunes, to them still playing say, To well felt greef, playnt ys the onely pleasure, O Lighte of Sunne, whiche ys entitled Day, O well thow doest, that thow no longer buydest, For mourning Night, her black weedes may display, O Phebus with good Cause thy face thow hydest, Rather then have thy all beholding eye, Fowlde with this sighte while thow the Charyott guydest And well meethinckes becomes this vaulty skye, A stately Tombe to cover hym deceassed, Youre Dolefull Tunes sweete Muses now apply. O Philomela with thy Brest oppressed, By shame and greef, help, help, mee to Lament Suche Cursed harmes as can not bee redressed, Or yf thy mourning Notes bee fully spent, Then give a quyett eare unto my playning, For I to teache the worlde Complaynt am bent, Yee Dimmy Clowdes whiche well employ youre stayning, This Cherefull Ayer with youre obscured cheare, Witnes youre wofull teares with dayly rayning, And yf o Sunne, thow ever didst apeare, In shape w?? by mans eye mighte bee perceyved, Vertue ys Deade, now sett thy Tryumphe here, Now sett thy Tryumphe in this Worlde bereaved, Of what was good, wheare now no good dothe lye, And by the Pompe âorâ Losse will bee conceyved, All notes of myne, youre selves together tye, With too muche greef mee thinckes yo? are dissolved, Youre Dollefull tunes sweete Muses now apply, Tyme ever oulde and younge ys still revollved, Within yt self and never taketh ende, But Mankynde ys for ay to noughte resolved, The filthy snake her aged Cote can mend, And getting yowthe, in yowth ageane can florish. But unto Man Age ever deathe dothe sende, The very Trees with grafting wee can Cherish, So that wee can longe tyme produce theyre tyme, But Man w?? helpeth them must helples perish, Thus thus the Myndes w?? over all do clyme, When they by yeares experience gett best graces, Must finish then by Deathes detested Cryme, Wee last short while, and buylde long lasting places, Ah lett us all ageanst fowle Nature Crye, Wee Natures worckes do help, shee us defaces, For howe can Nature unto this apply? That shee her Chylde I say her best Childe killeth, Youre Dolefull Tunes, sweete Muses now apply, Alas mee thinckes my weykened voyce but spilleth, The vehement Course of this just Lamentation, Mee thinckes my sounde no place w?? sorrow filleth. I knowe not I, but once in Detestation, I have my self and all what lyfe conteyneth, Synce Deathe on vertues forte hathe made invasyon, One worde of woe, an other after trayneth, Ne doo I Care howe Rude bee my Invention, So yt bee seene what sorowe in mee rayneth O Elementes by whose (they say) Contention, Owre Bodyes bee in living power meyntayned Was this Mans Deathe the fruite of youre Dissention, O Phisickes powre whiche (some say) hathe restrayned Approche of Deathe; alas thow helpest meigerly, Whenn once one ys for Atropos distrayned, Greate bee Phisicions bragges, but ayde ys beggerly, When Rooted moysture fayles or groweth dry, They leave of all and say Deathe comes too aegerly, They are but wordes therefore w?? men do bwye, Of any synce Esculapius ceassed, Youre Dolefull tunes, sweete Muses now apply, Justice, Justice, ys now (alas) oppressed, Bountyfullnes hathe made his last Conclusyon, Goodnes for best attyre in Dust ys dressed, Shepeheardes bewayle youre uttermoste Confusion, And see by this Picture to yow presented, Deathe ys oure Home, Lyfe ys but a Delusion. For, see, (alas) who ys from yow absented, Absented, Nay, I say, for ever banisshed, From suche as were to dye for hym, contented, Oute of oure sight in turne of hand ys vanished Shepeheard of Shepeheardes whose well settled order, Private with wealthe, Publique with quyet garnisshed, While hee did Live, farr, farr was all Disorder, Example more prevayling then Direction. Farr was Home stryfe, and farr was fooe from border, His Lyfe a Lawe, his Looke a full Correction, As in his healthe wee healthfull were preserved, So in his sicknes grewe oure sure infection. His Deathe our Deathe, but ah my Muse hathe swerved, Frome suche deepe playnte, as shoulde oure woes discrye, Whiche hee of us for ever hathe deserved, The style of heavy harte can never Flye, So hye as shoulde make suche a fame notoryous, Cease Muse therefore, thy Dart O Deathe apply? And Farewell Prince whome goodnes hathe made gloryous. [Farewell O Sunne, Arcadias clearest Lighte] Farewell O Sunne, Arcadias clearest Lighte, Farewell O Perle the Pore mans plenteous treasure, Farewell O golden staff the Weyke mans mighte, Farewell O Joy the Woofulles onely pleasure, Wisdome, Farewell, the skilles mans direction, Farewell with thee, Farewell all oure affection. For what place now ys lefte for oure affection, Now that of purest Lampe ys queynte the Lighte Whiche to oure Darckned myndes was best Direction, Nowe, that the Mynde ys Lost of all oure Treasure, Now Deathe hathe swallowed up oure worldly pleasure, Wee Orphantes lefte voyde of all publique mighte, Orphantes in deede deprived of Fathers mighte, For hee oure Father was in all affection, In oure well dooynge placing all his pleasure, Still studdying howe to us to bee a Lighte, As well in peace hee was a safest treasure, In warr his witt and worde was oure direction. Whence, whence, alas shall wee seeke oure Direction? When that wee feare oure hatefull Neighboures mighte Who longe have gapte to gett Arcadian treasure, Shall wee now fynde a Guyde of suche affection, Who for oure sakes will thincke oure travell lighte, And make his payne [to keepe us safe his] pleasure. No; no, for ever go? ys all oure Pleasure, For ever wandering from all good direction, For ever blynded of oure Clearest sighte, For ever lamed, of oure surest mighte. For ever banisht from well plaste Affection For ever robbed of oure Royall Treasure. Lett Teares for hym, therefore bee all oure Treasure And in oure wailefull naming hym, oure pleasure, Lett Hating of oure selves bee oure affection, And unto deathe bend still oure thoughtes direction. Lett us ageanst oure selves employ oure Might, And putting oute of eyes seeke wee oure Lighte. Farewell oure Lighte, Farewell oure spoyled treasure, Farewell oure Mighte, Farewell oure Daynted pleasure, Farewell Direction, Farewell all affection. Here ende the Fourthe Eglogues, and the Fourthe Booke or Acte. The Fifte and Last Booke or Acte. [Since Natures worckes bee good and Deathe dothe serve] Since Natures worckes bee good and Deathe dothe serve, As Natures worckes, why shoulde wee feare to dye? Synce Feare ys vayne, but when yt may preserve? Why shoulde wee feare that w?? wee can not flye? Feare ys more payne, then ys the Payne yt feares, Disarming humane myndes of Native mighte, While eache Conceipt, an ugly Figure beares, Whiche were not evill well wayed in Reasons light. Oure Owly Eyes w?? dymmd with passions bee, And scarce discerne the Dawne of Coming Day, Lett them bee Clearde, and nowe begin to See, Oure Lyfe ys butt a Stepp in Dusty Way. Then lett us holde the Bliss of peacefull Mynde, Since this wee feele, great Loss we can not Fynde. APPENDIX I O my thoughtes, sweete foode my onely owner (From Clifford MS, f? 217 r. and v.) O my thoughtes, sweete foode my onely owner, O my heavens for taste by the heavenly pleasure, O the fayre Nymphe borne to doo woemen honor, Lady, my Treasure, Where bee now those Joyes, that I lately tasted? Where bee nowe those eyes ever inly persers? Where bee now those wordes never idelly wasted? Woundes to Rehersers, Where ys ay that face, that a Sunne defaceth? Where bee those wellcomes by no worthe deserved? Where bee those mooving the Delightes, the graces? Howe bee wee swerved? O hideous absence, by thee I am thralled? O my vayne worde go?, Ruyn of my glory? O dere allegiance, by thee am I called Still to bee sory. But no more wordes, thoughe a worde bee spoken, Nor no more wording with a worde to spill mee? Peace due alledgeance, Duty must bee broken, Yf Duety kill mee. Then come, O come, then I do come, receyve, Slay mee not, for stay, doo not hyde thy blisses; But betweene those armes, never else do leave mee Give mee my kisses. O my thoughtes, sweete foode, my onely owner? O my heavens for Taste, by the heavenly pleasure? O the fayre Nymphe borne to doo woemen honor? Lady, my Treasure.</field>
