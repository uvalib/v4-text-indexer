      <field name="fulltext">[I Pasqwin long haue dwelt in Rome] Pasquin is the Image of Herculus the sonne of Iupiter, and is commonly vsed in Rome for to set writinges vppon: the which writinges hath so disclosed the abuses of the Pope and his College of Cardinalls, that the picture made of stone hath Excommunication set vppon it, against all those which eyther write or read any thing which is set vp. But euen as the stone doth feare the exc?munication, so doth the most part of the Romaines. I Pasqwin long haue dwelt in Rome, before the Pope was borne: I knew y? time wh? twas a shame, for priestes crownes to be shorne. I knew also when not a Frier, in Rome could be espied: Untill sixe hundreth yeares were past, that Iesus Christ here died. The Gospell of our Sauiour Christ, eche man sought to aduaunce: Untill such time that Bishops of Rome, did long abide in Fraunce. And so when they returned againe, vnto their natiue soyle: For to maintaine superbiousnes, Gods word they sought to spoyle. Then Images and Idols huge, for filthy lukers sake: The Pope commaunded presently, that euery Church should take. Not onely this was suffered, but it more to abuse: The Popes owne person straight alowed, the setting vp of stewes. The which for troth doth bring such gaine, vnto the Church of Rome: That all mischiefe, which was or is, by whoredome it doth come. For Purgatory inuented was, euen at that present time: For to perswade that Popes had power, to pardon euery crime. Not onely here when men doth liue, but also after death: Some holde the Pope can pardon sinne, but he can geue no breath. But I poore Pasqwin long haue sayd, and so say still I can: That he which by right pardoneth sinne, may also make a man. But that the Pope can make a man, I meane not so to say: But thus I know destroy he hath, ten thousand in a day. Yet as for me I will not speake, nor yet against it spurne: For feare they do me inquisite, and so my body burne. Excommunication they did set vp, against me and all men: That would once seeme by any meanes, to take in hand the pen: To write how they by subtile craft, doth take both care and paine: Euen contrary vnto Gods word, their lawes for to maintaine. And therefore now recant I will, with all possible speede: Pachecco is the great Inquisitor of Rome.For feare least that Pachecco come, and burne me vp in deede. For he it is which I do feare, and so doth many a man: For if a man denie not God, he burnth him if he can. But rather then I will be burned, it shall so come to passe: That if Pachecco come this way, he shall heare me at Masse. And for no small foole will I pray, but for some man of honor: The which shall be as great a man, as euer was olde Boner. Euen for him will I go say, the Masse of dayly rest: For thus I know that Boner hath, made many man bene blest. For God made him a minister, that he might try of those: Who were elect and chosen ones, and who then were Gods foes. Therfore sure I will go forward, my Masse now for to say: There shall but one thing in y? world, me onely cause to stay. And that is this: I am in doubt, I must say Masse alone: For in all England Papistes now, I know there is not one. And yet there were not twelue monethes past, yea thousandes here and there: But if a man will seeke them now, he shall finde them no where. For since these rebells late did rise, thus doth the Papist packe: To get the cloth of some stout man, Papistes to maintayne their Poperye, weare the liueryes of Lordes, Gentelm? and Lawyers. to put vpon his backe. But true subiectes should still beware, what men they entertaine: And not to catch all Papistes vp, to make a mightie traine. For Christ the Lord him selfe hath sayd, this text to verefie: That where soeuer the caren dies, the Egles thether flie. And so must I needes iudge that m?, where euer that he dwell: That fostereth Papistes in his house, he mindeth to rebell. And a proued saying it is, and so it will be euer: That like to like will alwaies seeke, some meanes to come together. And therfore now good gentlemen, be circumspect and wise: Let no Papist amongst them all, your liueries disguise. Wrap not a Wolfe in a Lambes cote, nor a Goate in a Sheepes skin: Try your seruantes religion, and what fayth they are in. For now if any man doth say, a Papist, a Papist is: Then straight waies will the Papist say, my Lord shall know of this. But if the statute for retaine, were sought as it should bee: He that now geueth thirtie coates, should neede to geue but three. And Papistes should not boast them selues, as they do vie to do: If so twere that our godly lawes, were better looked vnto. But as for me I beare no rule, but dayly will I pray: That neuer proud olde Popishe Priest, may see his golden day. Except it be as Boner doth, which lieth deepe vnder grasse: For whose good rest I will in hast, now say my Requiem Masse. In troibo ad altare dei, Thinking on Boner by the wei. Confiteor deo, and to our good Lady, Et omnibus Sanctis quia peccani, In homicide and lechery, In sacrilege and glotony, And in all kinde of knauery. Et Iddio precor beatÃ¦ maria, That thou wilt not thinke I euer did lia, Nor that Gods people I caused to fria, Because that the truth they semed to tria. Mesereatur vestri let the Pope haue, For he is starcke honest take away the knaue. He vseth many times to forgeue sinne, But y? more he forgeueth the more you are in. Absolutionem &amp; remission? omnum peccator? vestror?, So that all your life still be in reprobum. Otherwise blessed father hath nothing to do, For he him selfe wholy is inclined therunto. Kirieleyson, Christeeleyson, Kirieleyson, Pater noster, For olde Sauage bloudy Boner the Butcher. Requiem eternam Lord let him haue, For he was a great man, sage, and graue. Te decet himnus in Sion, Boner playde the ramping Lion. Therefore sweete Lady let him haue rest, For he was a man of the Pope blest. Oremus. O most vngracious Pope, Which was olde Boners hope, Now send helpe with a rope, Your old frendes wanteth scope. And all your olde traine, Be risen in vaine, And hanging shall be the gaine, That they shall haue for paine. For it is right and reason, That h?ging vp should be no geyson, To those which long inu?ted treason, In euery place and at ech season. Lexio libri macalebeorum. Indiebus illis vir fortissimus Boner. colatione facta, Of a n?ber of his deare frendes with a racha: And when he had collected them all, He swore a great oth by his holy pall: If they would against Popery spurne, And all olde Popish Priestes seeke for to burne: He would geue them benefices &amp; great pension, So y? they would do it with singular deuotion. For I know (sayth he) it will so fall, That we shall be plagued with these Priestes of Ball. For in euery corner they bring it so to passe, That they be a m?bling of Mattens or Masse. So thus they dissemble w? their fained hipocrisy, They still maintaine their wonted Idolatry: Which I neuer in all my life could once abide, No more then can the Tanner the hide. And that ech man doth surely know, For in life and doctrine I did it show. Grad. Si ambulem in medio vmbre mortis, non timebo mala: For my body is cleane from keping of scortis in parler and in halla But not in chamber.. Tractus. Sicut ceruus desiderat ad fontes aquarum, So haue I desired to strike vp a larum. To feede &amp; to nourish al those which pretended, Preaching Gods prouid?ce or life to be am?ded. Fuerunt michi lachrimÃ¦ meÃ¦ penes die ac nocta, That all those were not burned which were in Colehouse lockt a. For I did so loue that race and that knot, That I sent them to heauen would I or not. Initium Sancti euangelij Secundum Consistorium Romanorum. In illo tempore. Boner came to Rome in post, And did defie all the host. Pope and Cardinalls euery chone, In the time of K. Henry the viij. Boner renounced the Pope to his face in the open Consistory at Rome remaining there yet in recorde. Which supreme head would take them on, In Consistory he did declare, And by Gods lawe he there did sweare: That no man ought in any thing, To be supreme aboue the king. For God had chosen him alone, In English land to rule the throne. When Boner had his message ended, The Cardinalls then to speake intended. Holy father if we suffer this, Our vsurping will go amisse. Therefore this is our consent, That he be called incontinent. When that we haue with him i?gled, Let him then vp in prison be hanged. By this example men will be afraid, And all shall be troth y? we haue said. Non demittitur peccatum, Nisi restituatur ablatum. For if he escape, Coledges &amp; Scholes, Will count vs as doltes, idiots, and fooles. Thus they conciuded that famous Boner, Boner scaped hanging.Should then at Rome hang for his honor. But Boner perceauing wherto they were bent, Made hast vnto Ienua incontinent. And so by trauaile and with little paine, He passed by Sea straight into Spaine. The Pope in meane while curriors sent out, Here tenne, there twentie, all in a route. Some vnto Neaples to the sea side, Some vnto Milleine other waies as wide. But all was in vaine, for Boner at ease, Was well at his rest, and passed the seas. And vnto King Henry he then declared, How he with the Pope in Rome had fared. And when the king his message hard, He made him Bishop for his reward. Thus Boner a while had faith, and did well, But at the last from troth he fell. How farre he fell I can not tell, But some say pride causde him to swell. Hostias &amp; prÃ¦ces tibi Papa offerimus, For thy superstition doth still defend vs. Lauabo manus meas. Boner washed his handes. From Iustice and equitie, Mercy and pitie, Humblenes &amp; humilitie, Troth and veritie, Faith and fidelitie, Grace and gracilitie, Loue and charitie, From vertuous innocencie, And fr? all kind of honestie. Orate fratres &amp; sorores, That Boners frendes may mend their mores: Or els twill happe ere it be long, That God will punish very strong, This realme of Engl?d in eche place, For suffering of this impious race. Treason still they do inuent, And to mischiefe they are bent: Yet they fast all the whole lent, A good cause why their money spent. Looke to the route that rose of late, What Princes they haue set at bate. Iame of Scotland can testifie, Papistes delight in murther. For he was slaine traiterously. Fie for shame fie, fie, fie, fie, fie, Oh holy Cakeholickes perdie. Requiem eternam dona eis Domine, For surely it is time, That traitors bodies were buried. That seeke so hie to clime. Hanging were to good, Quartering would be seene: Upon those traitors which do resist, So mercifull a Queene. Offetorij. Seuen charitable Oes. O Pie Pater, that is y? author, of man slaughter. O sure and good, is that red hoode, which sucketh lambes bloud. O faythfull and true, is all that hew, which Christes flocke subdue. O wise and wittie, is all that citie, that wanteth pitie. O blessed Pope, that geueth scope, that men in thee hope. O worthy restation, which seeketh saluation, in place of damnation. O louing charitie, and sweete sinceritie, that burnes men for veritie. These be those which of late dayes, Deserued honor and worthy prayse. Suscipe papÃ¦ oblationem quam tibi offerimus, For the soule of Boner, Which was a worthy man deseruing honor. He liued in repentaunce long for his sin, He could scarce see out his cheekes were so thin. His meat was water, his drincke was bread, When he was aliue, he thought he was dead. He fasted and prayed all day and all night, His body was worne for sorrow so light, That scarce he could go, sit, stand, or lie, But straight he must drink his throte was drie. Many times ashes he vsed to eate, When that he could get no other meate. Well was that seene when that he was dead, He looked like a Bore which in stie had ben fed. Thus led he his life as you heard before, In fasting and praying, and whipping full sore. And in burning of those which either pretended, Once preaching of truth or life to be mended. Per omnia secula seculorum. Boner playde the Iustice of Corum. Dominus vobiscum. For he scapte well, when he came fr? Rome. From sursing in a cord a, He made good hast O Lord a. Vere dignum &amp; Iustum est, That the winde stoode in the west, When Boner was buried in the night, Or els we had had a maruelous fight. For y? Louainestes would faine haue come ouer, But they could not well land at Douer. Although some Papistes for him were faint, Yet the reast would make him a saint. If they could but to a bone of his come, They would make a shift to send it to Rome. For nothing of such a man may once be lost, For surely he was a man of great cost. Many a Papist was vndone by Boners death. Yea both cost and costly, as I do heare say, For some butchers Papistical did hope for a day. But now that their hope is turned to dust, They are become beggars, &amp; lost is their lust. Bruers and Bakers the like of that sort, May now with the Pope go play for a sport. Chaundlers &amp; Poticaries, Phisitions and all, Must not vnto Boner for any debt call. For when he is Bishop of London agayne, He meanes to pay ech man that hoped in vaine. Shomakers and Taylors, and of euery arte, Of his poore Bishoppricke shall haue a part. I my selfe once some gaynes should haue had, If that continually I would haue bene mad. A great many fooles Boner did make, Which now become beggers all for his sake. But they right well deserued it that are so stiffe minded, That w? his blind sophistry stil they are blinded. He is blind y? c? not see, yet he would if he could: He is more blind that will not see, yet could if he would. But blind are all those that sayes that Boner, Did not die like a Bishop in state and in honor. And was buried in p?pe &amp; with as much praise, As euer was Bishop in the night dayes. Men of great state beside him to lie, Which at S. Thomas a watering did die. And as sure as they still theft refused, So Boner of treason could not be accused. Wherefore Sanctus, Sanctus, holy was that man, Accuse hym now if any man can. Come, come, goodwife Clone did he loue you, Or you Cate Darbishire tell vs now true. If he did as he did: what remedie, Care that care will I care not I. Benedictus qui venit in nomine domini, Blessed are those which commeth in the name of the Lord, Unblessed are they which w? it doth not accord. A petition to the Pope. Te Igitur Impiissime pater, That for the loue of thy sonne the Frater. Thou wilt condemne knaue nor lyer, Neither Sodomit, Monke, nor Fryer. Neither Queane, Curtisan, nor Baude, Nor any of them which liueth by fraude. For if thou do, a great part must thou leese, Of thy reuenues and of thy fees. The court of Sauellus must needes be mayned, If al kind of leudnes should not be maintained. Wherfore geue Harding some stipend by y? yeare, For he defendeth your cause to be cleare. And sure he sayth true, if I do lie, But after in memento the truth shall ye spie. Wherefore in primis quam tibi offerimus, pro ecclesiÃ¦ tua romana. We commend to thee, of ech degree, not sparing Cortisana. But first of all, we to thee call, for holy father the Pope: In whom all we, of ech degree, still haue a seruent hope. He is our proctor, yet no doctor, except it be in sedition: A Papist right, an hypocrite, a further of Inquisition. Both neare and farre he rayseth warre, no peace can he abide: If he may proue, it commeth for loue, on Iesus Christes side. Memento domine Cardinall Auguste, how sober a man he is: Which euer doth quafe, but neuer doth laufe, vntill his breech he pisse. Cardinall of Trent, vseth in Lent, to fast and keepe good diet: But most men sayes, for forty dayes, he is dronke and out of quiet. The cause why Morone was not Pope, was because he once tasted of the truth: And that was the cause why neither Steph. Gardiner, nor Boner were Cardinals in the time of Queene Mary.Cardinall Morone, maketh great mone, because he was not Pope: Seing honesty, did put him by, he now no more doth hope. Cardinall Pulchan, a stout Romayne, which hath two bastardes braue: Was had in the lurch, euen by the Church, to be a very knaue. Cardinall Phernes, let nothing displease, a man seuere in life: But for one toy, he loued a Boy, better then mayde or wife. Cardinall Aracely, not kin to Helly, for this is a lying Fryer: Which came to honor, not like to Boner, yet this is a common lier. Cardinall Farrare, a man full of care, to make gardens of pleasure: Where as Cortisans vse, themselues to abuse, withouten meane or measure. Cardinall Hosius, with his dronken nolus, maintayner of Idolatrie: Is commonly fed, by the romish hed, for to defend hypocrisie. Cardinall Arogone, slue a man at Verone, and for that godly deede: The Pope in hast, professed him chast, and made him bishop with speede. Cardinall Pachecco, Inquisitor the gretto, and Bucheron of Spaine: Doth wholy delight, ech day and night, Christes flocke to put to payne. Cardinall Vitello, a right frend and fellow, now Chamberlaine of Rome: As I do heare tell, loues a whoore well, when he may to them come. Cardinall of Lorein, a proud Prince forein, he commeth fro the Guise: All rancor and hate, all malice and debate, against Christes flocke doth rise. Cardinall Granueale, loues mutton well, as goeth the common report: For being in Flaunders, he so caught y? glanders, his heare fell away in sport. Cardinall Columny, a Romayne princely, stoute, braue, and also proude: Of late was a meane, that ech Baud &amp; queane, in Rome should be alowed. Cardinall Muola, no Asse nor Fose a, but in one point he was vnwise: For his being Cardinall, the Venitians all, doth him as Traytor despise. Cardinall de Medicy, a trimme yong m? surely, of Florence Cardinall sure: With wanton eye, doth prig and pry, ech louer to alure. Cardinall Alshiatta, a Cardinall made of late a, and a Spainyard proud for life: Is sure and trusty, and marueilous lusty, with many a Romaines wife. Cardinall Borome, the honestes I dare say, that is amongst the race: Was so entangled, that he had bene hanged, if had not riden a pace. Cardinall Sauellus, with Michaell Bowellus, which now is the Popes Sonne: As he is a lier, and a Dominicke Fryer, shall end where as we begonne. Et omnium circumstanti? quor? tibi mores cognita est: Which be very simple, when they be at the best. As Ruffana, Putana, Cortisana, Concubina, Bardassina: As Baroni, Pultroni, Manigoldi, Goffi, Asarsina. All this race belong vnto Sodomites, Wherein the Romish priestes chiefly delightes. Hanc igiter oblationem seruitutis noster, Friers &amp; Monkes haunt more the stewes then their cloyster. Quam oblationem the Pope doth most desier, For his good Lordship was once a Fryer. Benedictam a scriptam by Daniel the Prophet, That the Citie of Rome is Antichristes soccet. And sure by their deedes they shew it so plaine, That for to describe it, it were but vaine. Yet to defend it I am surely bound, For in Citie of Rome I spent many a po?d. The first day of Lent called ashe wensday, All masking robes be layd away. Eche man in forenoone ashes doth take, Which makes th? remember who did th? make. But at afternoone straight with abhomination, They go to Saint Sabin vnto the stacion. Both old men and young deuoutly doth pray, That they may meete their whoores by y? way. If they do not meete th? do not much care, They know where they dwell and how well they fare. But yet one matter I must needes disclose, Without any forging or seeking to glose. For ech day in Lent a stacion there is, And the people in no h?d must seme for to mis. For if they do, tis true this fault are they in, They lose their pardon for all their sinne. The bandes that be beaten so oft on the side, Against this holy tyme, yong ware wil prouide. The which shall be trimme and fayre to see, Curteous and gentle, and marueilous free. With Satin and Ueluet and fine cloth of golde, Thus whoores in the Lent is set to be solde. Now Italians &amp; Spainyardes be quickly alured, And causeth these hoores straight to be procured. And thus for a space they lurke in transgression, The hope which they haue to make satisfaction, is the chiefe cause of their sinne. Hoping in the end to make satisfaction. And so against Easter they come and confesse, Unto a pilde Fryer how they did transgresse. The Fryer then hoping some money to haue, Asketh what penaunce he lusteth to craue. The gentleman for ease craueth penance light, But so the Fryer will not him quite: But whip him he must on maundy thursday, Or els he is no Christian right. Except he do so entreat the fryer, That some man for money he may hier, The Fryer at the length entreated will be, So that their Cloyster may haue a fee. A man in Rome may hyre a man to do penaunce for hym. A three quarters of wheat, &amp; two buts of wine, Shall make vs to pray for that sinne of thine. And so I do not doubt but all shalbe well, Untill an other yeare like sinne shall compell. Thus yeare, by yeare and day by day, Sinne causeth vertue to decay. A number of these stories true could I wright, But thereunto I am not pight. It is a masse for Boner which I am about, Hoc est enim corpus of a lout, Ten bushells of meale if twere in a cake, Such a body as Boners it would not make. For he was a great man of much honor, Hic est enim calix sanguinis of olde Boner. Malmesey and Muscadine, good Ale and double Beere, But euer he hated to be at good cheere. Brawne &amp; Mustard, fat Uenson and Capon, Had almost made him as leane as a Bacon. For like a Porkehog which long had bene fed, So looked this Boner before he was dead. Memento etiam Domine, Boner that is dead, His sonne that is fled, Kate Darbishire and mother Clone, Doctor Darbishire his second sonne, His sonnes and daughters euery chone, Not forgetting any one. Remember also Boners frendes, Where that they be in Alehouse or Indes. These be Louanistes. Harding, Saunders, or Dorman, Story, Rastall, or Horman. Taylor, Butler, and Knot, Cope, Allen, and Scot. Marshall, Giblet, and Bullocke, Kirton, Harris, and Clenocke. Griffen, Henshow, and Wilson, Goldwell, Inglefield, and Morton. Stapleton, Iohnson, and Pillinges, Shackloc, Powlot, and Pinninges. Elis Haywood, and Wiles, Geasper Haywood, and Giles. Iohn Haywood, and Brooke, Morbred, Freman, and Hooke. Wikes, Young, Wiles, and Wilkin, Peto, Price, and Pirkin. Shely, Dygby, and Parker, Pridiockes, Alway, and Fowler. Haruy, Daniell, and Filames. Shepheard, Smith, and Fuwilliams, Preston, Purpoynt, and Peter, S. Simon, S. Wright, and S. Oliuer. These with the rest beares Boner goodwill, And these be those which thinke Pope no ill. Yet they are true subiectes as they say, But I maruell why they ran away. Some of them had licence to passe to Spayne, But their yeares are out, they come not agayne. Where in I will not say they do rebell, But of my conscience they do not well. No, no, these be none of those which shewed to the Pope, To keepe Abby landes for a day of hope. No, no, these be none of those which mony haue spent, To haue the Popes licence to eat flesh in Lent. No, no, these be none of those, nor of that guise, Which caused the rebels of late to rise. These be true subiectes of English soyle, These seeke dayly to betray their Countrey.Which neuer sought their countrey to spoyle. But this I know they pray night and day, That Spainyardes in Engla?d might haue a pray. These are no traytors: what are they then? Louainistes and Catholickes, goodly men. Many an olde wife her purse doth enlarge, To helpe to beare some part of their charge. Many a popish priest his money doth geue, This sect of sophistry to relieue. Many officers in England there are, That of this rout doth take some care. Yea and I feare me there are a great sort, Which do to their power these rebels comfort. But these be worse then traytors be, For all their treason we plainly see. And for the other they are wholy bent, All malice and mischiefe to inuent. O England, England, couldst thou spue out those, Which vnto God and their Queene be foes, Then thousands I thinke should be spued out, And Gods word should be preached sincere without doubt, For hath it at any tyme euer bene seene, That he can loue God, that hateth his Queene: Especially when she is all the chiefe cause, That God is preferred, and his holy lawes? The Pope is suppressed, Idolatry put downe, In euery Uillage, Citie, and Towne. Whereat the Deuill doth so rage and rore, That the Papistes bleede at the hart therefore. And therefore now into corners they passe, To haue superstition and Idolatrous Masse. And in the same corners the Deuill is at hand, To make th? with treas? their Prince to w?st?d. And this he perswads th? I know it most sure, If that you do suffer this law to endure. The Pope and all Popery will soone decay, And all your dominion shall vade away. The which I pray God may sone haue an end, And ech Christi? &amp; papist their liues may am?d. Now to my memento agayne will I come, Wherein I will touch some sort of Rome. And a few wil I shew which Boner maintained. When that in tyme of Queene Mary he raigned. A wilde Roge and a Ruffeler, A Paylyard and a proud Pedler. A tame Roge and a Tynker, A Abraham man and a Frater. A Iackman and a Patrico, A Whipiack and a Kitchinco, A Dell and a Antemorte, A Counterfait Cranke &amp; a Doxe. A demaunder for Glymar, A Baudy Basket and a Domerar, A Kitchin mort and a fresh Mariner. These be those which Boner did hate, More I thinke then mother Clonnes Kate, No he did hate euen all this whole summe, Euen as he did the Popes grace of Rome. Wherfore honest Roges where euer ye go, The hores of Rome pay their tribute to the Court of Sauellus, which Court maintayneth the officers of Rome, as Sarge?ts, Balies, &amp;c. Haue Boner your Saint in memento. Remember Sauellus that Cardinall alway, The honestes of Rome to him tribute doth pay. He is the Popes Uicar, and Uicar of Rome, For which he doth pay a prety round summe. Yet what he doth pay I know not the ground, But tis knowen he receiueth xx. thousand po?d. For once a decree was made in the Citie, That publike queanes should auoid w?out pitie. When number was tak? not yet thre yeare past. Tw?ty thousand whoores were found in y? last. Now when they were sumned so many did appeare, The Pope well considered his gaynes by the yeare. And so wisely withdrew his former pretence, And forced no Cortisan to go from thence. Neither did he any by any meanes forbed, But they might be whoores which ment not to wed. So if ech whoore her knaue from Rome should beare, Streets would be void, houses would be clere. The Pope and his Cardinals with all of their kinde, In Rome might you seke, but none should you finde, Ne Bishop nor Abbot, ne Dolt, Foole, ne Sot, Would tary in Rome the countries so hote. Neyther Benedictes nor Barnardines, Iesuhwites nor Capechines, Carthusians nor Theretines, Sexsterians nor Celestines, Dominicans nor Carmelines, Nor Coniurer nor Pardonor, Except it were the Bugeror. All would follow the troupe and trayne, Euen of the whoores if they went to Spayne. Rome is full of Sodomits.If all their trayne from Rome were gone, And Sodomites were left alone. Yet thousand thousandes should still remaine, The vilder Citie, the more to their paine. A fewe honest men yet left there are, Which lie in prison in paine and care: And preach vnto them so farre as they dare, God spareth Rome for the elect sake. And for their sakes God doth it spare. Other wayes no man by reason can say, Why God his iust iudgement of vengeaunce doth stay. Yet this was that Citie which Edmund Boner, Did holde in reuerence and in great honor. In so much that euen vntill he was dead, He tooke the Pope for supreame head. Such a father such a sonne, such a head such a foote, As the body was rotten so was the hart roote. Nobis quo? peccatoribus, From straunge beastes defend vs. Per ip ? sum, et cum ip ? so, et in ip ? so, The blessing of the Chalice. Boner was a Gentelman who sayes no, His mother had as many at her becke, As euer had the Clerke of the checke. His father was a Priest and vsed to pray, Both for quicke and dead euery day. But about in procession he neuer was caried, Nor yet euer to any woman was he maried. Yet in procession he vsed to goe, And so would his children, some hie, some low, Which were nurste commonly at eche mans boorde, Euen as the goodwife her selfe could afforde. But Boner of this seede was not sowne, For his mother was a mayde and a woman knowne, Which Syr Sauage did kepe his bed for to make, And sometimes paines with himself for to take. Oremus. As Boner liued and taught vs to pray, A prayer for his Lordship let vs say. For surely he deserued no lesse for to haue, He was a holy man, wise, sage, and graue. He dreamed of a Purgatory, but where it did stand, No m? could tell, by sea or by land. The Scripture of y? place no menti? doth make, Where soules be both broyld, rost, sod, &amp; bake. Except it be in hell where faithlesse men lye, Where euer they remayne and neuer shall dye, Purgatory is the greatest gaynes that the Pope hath.Yet Purgatory bringes Rome more golde a day, Then two horse well loden will cary away. And therfore swete wormes feede wel of Boner. Spare not his flesh though he were of honor. We know that he stonke before he was dead, We know that his body was fat and well fed, Therfore spare not his body I hartily you pray, But for his soule nothing will I say. For the Iudge of iudges his s?tence doth geue, Euen of his mercy as the man doth beleue. Though Boner were a reprobate to ech mans iudgement, Yet no man doth know but y? God omnipot?t. Who iudgeth all men and is our refuge, And c?maunds vs straitly y? we shal not iudge. Therefore I thinke those doth not well, Which iudgeth men soules to be in hell. Except they know of this abhomination, That men do die in state of damnation. From the which I pray God deliuer vs all, Which with a true faith vnto him doth call. Pax domini sit semper vobiscum, And def?d you alwayes from y? Pope of Rome, For Agnus dei by him is forsaken, And Agnus dei by him is mistaken. Et verbum dei with fire was shaken, By those vilde lawes which Popes can maken. They made vs worship ech stock and stone, Which can not goe nor stand alone. Gratias agamus tibi domine, That all Christes enemies do decay. The kingdome of Poole, Denmarke, &amp; Hungary, The greatest part of Christendome hath forsaken the Pope. The kingdome of Boheme, most part of y? Emprie. With most of the states &amp; Princes of Germanie. Sweidland, Norwhei, &amp; Scotl?d, England, &amp; Irel?d, Hath tooke the word of God in hand, And against Idolatry stout doth stand. With many a region and kingdome beside, Which for want of memory I ouerslide. And I do not doubt but in a short space, God wil geue Fraunce and Flaunders such grace, That they will forsake the Romish race. And turne vnto Christ our Sauiour most good Which shed for vs all his most precious bloud. If they will do this and former life mend, The Turke &amp; the Pope wil soone haue an end. For Italy and Spayne for their leud lust, Must needes in short tyme turned to dust. Except they amend and repent them in tyme, Their Idolatry &amp; Lechery &amp; Sodomits crime. Wherefore once agayne dominus vobiscum, And y? Lord defend you fr? traditions of Rome. Oremus. Offerimus tibi papÃ¦ oblation? nostrÃ¦ seruitutis. Pro animabus famulorum tuor? Boner. Who was As mercifull as Nero, Who was As pitifull as Pluto, Who was As humble as Pharao, Who was Lowly as Pope Leo, Who was As faithfull as Cayphas, Who was As trustie as Iudas, Who was As holy as Saint Lambert, Read the life of S. Lambert in the Legendary. Who was As iust as Pilate, Who was As gracious as Pope Sigismond, Who was As vertuous as Turke Mahound, Commonly called Constance.Who was As credible as th'whole Co?cel of Constate, Who was As subiect as rebells which rose of late, Who was As louing as Caine, euen such an other, Who was Which Gods worde slue his brother. Who was That can testifie Darbishire his sonne, Who was And so can his bedfellow mother Clone, Who was With all the reast which he kept in Corum. Per omnia secula seculorum. Amen. Dominus vobiscum. And beware of treason from Rome. Requiescant in pace, With Frier Forest and Chace. Ita missa est, Mery may you rest, Untill more newes come, From the Citie of Rome. Absolutionem I Pasqwin geue you all, Hoping shortly it shall so fall: That I shall shew the Romish guise, How that by murder, theft, and lies, Their Church maintained long hath bene, Which is the authour of all sinne. FINIS quoth Petrus Pasqwinus. R. W.</field>
