      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. GASTON DE BLONDEVILLE. [Verse extracted from prose narrative.] THE BRIDAL. Lightly, lightly, bounded the roe, The hind o'er the forest was fleeing; The small birds tuned on every bough, In sun and shade their gleeing. And purple cups, and silver bells From the green leaves were peeping; The wild-rose smiled in the mossy dells: Nought but the thorn was weeping. And so bright in the sun its tears did shine, They showed like tears of pleasure; And the airs of May, through the budding spray, Breathed joyance, without measure. For this was Isabel's bridal morn Who loved each bud and flower, The wild-wood shade, the mountain head, The deep vale's mead and bower. And now was her festival gaily kept By hagled brook and fountain, From the low green bank, where the violet slept, To the blue hill-top and mountain. And lightly, lightly, bounded the roe, His footstep wing'd with pleasure, And small birds sang from every bough, Welcomes beyond all measure. [O'er the high western wolds afar] I. O'er the high western wolds afar, Glimmer'd some lights of yesterday; And there, one bright, but trembling star Among the streaky shadows lay, The traveller's lonely warning. But soon the winds, that sing day's dirge, Did o'er that star the shadows urge, And hung the night with mourning! II. “What steps on the waste are beating?” He listened not long on the ground, 'Ere he fearfully heard a sound, As of trampling hoofs retreating: And a dismal cry and a foot draw nigh; “Stand ho!” 'twas an armed man passed by: But he spoke no sound of greeting, And seemed like a death-shade fleeting. III. O'er the lone mountains riding, He gallop'd by gloomsome ways, Where night-mists were abiding, Round the witch of evil days: Her name is written on the wind, That speaks in cliffs and caves confin'd. List there when the waning moon goes down, And thou'lt hear the call her spirits own; But as they pass, hold a chrystal glass, Or thou'lt sorely rue the wild witch-tone. IV. O'er the lone mountains riding, From a distant land he came, No step his dark step guiding; But he thought he saw a flame, That bright, or dim, would sport awhile; Then vanish, as in very guile; He heard, as he passed, the witch-name sound; And his startled steed, at a single bound, Bore him away from that evil ground. V. But o'er the mountains pacing As fast as he can flee, Strange steps his steps are tracing, And a shape he cannot see; And, though he flee away, so prest, Whether to north, or south or west, Toward the past, or coming day, (So dim the night he may not say) Still oft by fits did ghastly gleam, A corpse-light, all unknown to him. VI. He followed the light o'er deserts wide, Down in deep glens, where wild becks wail; He followed by darkened forest side; He followed with dread, though link'd in mail; Till it stayed before an iron gate, Where battled turrets kept their state, O'er towers so high and massy strong, They seemed to giant-king belong. VII. Sir Adomar looked him all around: Turret on turret hung on high, Shaping black lines on the dim sky; Sir Adomar looked him all around; Nought, save this castle, could he spy, Though, heavily clanged a death-bell's sound; And in each pause of the shuddering blast, Moans were heard as of one from 'neath the ground! VIII. He struck on the gate with his good sword: “Ho! wardour, ho!” but never a word Return'd the wardour from within. “The storm is loud, the night is dark, I hear from the woods the dog-wolf bark. Up, wardour, up! it were a sin To turn a traveller from your tower, At such a lone and dreary hour; A Saracen would let me in!” IX. The wardour was watching through the loop, How many were of the stranger's troop. He had left his torch in the cullis' bar, And it let down a light on the lonely night, That showed him harnessed, as for war. His coat was mail, his helm was steel; His visor did his look reveal; Yet o'er his brow it cast a shade, That made the wardour more afraid, Than did the crimsoned plume above, Or the mighty grasp of his iron glove. He would not let the stranger in, Till one, awakened by the din— One whom the wardour need obey— Seeing a lonely knight stand there, Bade the wardour nought to fear: He feared still, but he said not Nay: Yet he would not ope the portal gate To an unknown knight, without his state; For neither squire, nor page, he saw: He bade him then to the postern draw. X. The knight dismounted at the call; The porter let him through the wall; He turned the weary steed to stall, And led the knight to the lordly hall. I' the lordly hall, so wide and dim, One drowsy squire awaited him. The ashy wood lay, white and cold, On the raised hearth, where late was told, With fiery eye and accent loud, The deed of martial prowess proud; Where late was told, in whispers low, Some tale of terror and of woe, The while each listener bent his head, Nor lost a word the trouveur said: Till fear crept o'er each nerve and vein, That late had swell'd to martial strain; And shadows crept along the wall, Such as the sinful soul appal: Till each, who heard, look'd round with dread, And saw some phantom of the dead. XI. Now silent was the hearth and lone, Save that a stag-hound slumber'd there. The tables in disorder were, With relics of the evening fare; The household to their rest were gone, And now no light was seen but one, The light that led the stranger on; That show'd above steel armour gleaming, And many a dusky banner streaming, From the black rafters of the roof, In the night-wind, far aloof, Like to some flitting phantom seeming; And, stalking o'er the rushy floor, It showed the knight where steps of gore Had stain'd its green, with foot-prints red. And the stag-hound, as the knight passed by, Sent forth a mournful fearful cry. XII. The drowsy squire the stranger led; (The wardour to his post was sped.) They traversed the hall in silent march: At the end was a door in a mitred arch. The knight stood before that mitred door, And gazed on a warrior shape above, That seem'd to watch the passage o'er. In his altered look strange passions strove! The armoured shape leaned on its sword, And downward bent its steely face, As jealous who below might pace, Or about to speak the challenge-word; And it seemed the very form of one, The knight perforce must look upon. XIII. Thus, while he stood in wonder-trance, The squire upheld the torch on high, Viewing the guest with watchful eye; And marvelling what strange mischance So check'd his step, and fix'd his glance:— “Sir knight, why gaze you on that steel? It is a baron's good and bold; Had he been here, no welcome cold Would he have shown a stranger-knight, Who trusted to his towers at night.” XIV. The spell of fant'sie loos'd awhile, The knight return'd a grateful smile, With thanks for this so courteous style; And, then with thoughtful accent said, While yet he stood, that shape before, “The armour some resemblance had To that of a dear friend no more! A friend!”—he paus'd,—“a friend long dead!” This, while he said, his colour fled. The squire seem'd not to note his pain, But, with fair speech, began again Excuse to make for slender fare, That it was night, and, not aware Of honour'd guest approaching there, The menials to their rest had gone; A chamber should be fitted soon. His squire and page should welcom'd be; Right well he longed that squire to see. XV. The wearied knight a gesture made, And looked his thanks, but nothing said; Save that, for rest alone he prayed. He sighed, as through that guarded arch, And vaulted gloom, he held his march; And there, before his doubting sight, Glided again a pale sad light, Full often he had seen with fear, Yet more he felt to meet it here. Then came they to an iron door, And the knight beheld that flame no more. It opened to a second hall, Where warriors frowned upon the wall; And ladies smiled in portraiture, With downcast eye and look demure. An umbered flash the red torch threw, Athwart each warrior's steadfast brow; And hardly might the gleam declare A baron grim from lady fair. XVI. There is no need that I should tell, What hasty fare the stranger took; Nor how the squire, with silent look, Watched, wondering, what had him befell; So strangely gleamed his hollow eyes, From forth the lifted beaver's shade So wan his lips, like one that dies, So few the words and thanks he paid! XVII. Though round the hall his looks would steal, Not well did torch or lamp reveal The portraiture of warriors grim, Or noble dames hung there so dim; Their frowns and smiles were lost to him. But once, when that he turned his head Where the fix'd torch a gleaming shed, A sable form, ill seen at most, Went gliding up a stair, on high, Passed through an open gallery, And through a door-way there was lost, That seemed to lead to antient rooms, Such as where silence dwells, and glooms. The knight, he felt a sudden chill, Though nought he said of what had sped; But the spicy draught he deeply quaff'd, Whenever the page his cup did fill. And from his spirits chaced the ill. XVIII. The night-cheer o'er, the page led on The stranger to his resting-place. He led the way, that form had gone: On the high stair he stood a space, Waiting the knight's reluctant pace, Then, with mute reverence, marshalled him Through many a gallery, long and dim, Where helmets watched, in order grim; Through many a chamber, wide and lorn, Where wint'ry damps had half withdrawn The storied paintings on the wall. Electra, o'er her brother's urn, There bent the head, and seemed to mourn; There, too, as meet in room and hall, Troy's tale The “Tale of Troy” appears to have been a very favourite subject in ancient tapestry. It occurs often in old castles, and is mentioned twice in this “Trew Chronique,” as adorning the walls of stately chambers. and Hector's piteous fall: Here Priam's Court, in purple and pall, Its golden splendour now had lost; But Helen, on the rampart stood, And pointed to the Grecian host, Out-stretching to the briny flood. Here Hector's wife sat in her bower, Waiting her lord's returning hour; And 'broidering 'midst her maiden train, While her infant played with silken skein. There—but it boots not that I say, What stories once, in long array, Lived on those walls, now ghastly clay. XIX. The knight would oft, as he strode by, Cast on their shade a searching eye; And pause, as list'ning some drear sound, That rose within the glimmering bound: And start, as though some fearful sight Passed along this gloom of night; But, at a lesser winding stair, (The long drawn chambers ended there,) When to that narrow stair he drew, He thought a robe of mourning hue Went fleeting up that winding way; No glimpse had he of shape or ray; No foot he heard the stair ascend. Yet still that seeming garment passed, As though some fiend, with evil haste, Did up that lonely tower wend. XX. The knight, he stood on the step below— “Whither, my young page, dost thou go? Who dwells within this lonely tower, Passing with speed, in sable weed— Passing with speed, at this dead hour?” “Nobody, save the raven-crow, Dwells within this lonely tower; And here, Sir knight, is your resting-bower!” “But in this tower I may not rest, Till I know who that stair has pressed; Did you not see that black weed wave?” “Yes, knight, I saw the raven's wing, Glint up that wall with sudden spring: And hark! you now may hear him crave!” XXI. “It is not courteous, that my bower Should be within this ruin'd tower!” “But see, knight, 'tis not in decay; The storm hath blown a bar away, And the raven through the loop doth stray; His nest is wet on the battlement grey: Your chamber is a stately room, Hung round with work of choicest loom; And erst it was the resting-place Of our dear Lady Baroness, Before she went to stranger-land. My lord yet strays on foreign strand. The chamber has another stair, Leading to many chambers fair; But no step goes by night so far, Since my lord baron went to war.” XXII. The page stept on with torch before, Far as that stately chamber's door. “Page! lift that light—fain would I know, Whither that second flight doth go?” “It goes to a battlement up on high, And to a turret perching by.” “Doth none keep watch on that turret high?” “None, but the raven with his cry! Your rest, Sir knight, he will not break; To traitors only doth he speak. They say he scents the new spilt blood.” Upon the stair the raven stood! He turn'd his dark eye on the knight, And, screaming, upward winged his flight. The wondering page looked back with fright, And met the stranger's fiery glance; Then, hardly daring to advance, Lingered he at that chamber-door; “On,” said the knight, “with torch before!” Scarce was the page the threshhold o'er, When check he made, and pale he turn'd; Dim and more dim the torch-flame burn'd. The knight look'd on, but nothing saw, That might explain this sudden awe. XXIII. A spacious chamber there was spread, And, for his rest, a stately bed; Fresh rushes on the floor were strewn; Faint on the arras'd walls were shown The heroes of some antient story, Now faded, like their mortal glory. Another form, as dark as doom, Stood within that chamber's gloom, Unseen by those who entered there. His cause of dread the page thus said: “Methought I saw, within that chair, The baron's self, my very lord; I saw it, on a true man's word: I saw my lord return'd from far, Arrayed, as he went forth to war! He fixed his very eyes on me, But looked not, as he wont to look. Yet now no living shape I see, And know that here he could not be; For, long since, he these walls forsook: Yet is it strange such visions pale, Should o'er my waking sight prevail.” XXIV. “Whose are these antient walls, I pray?” The sullen stranger 'gan to say: “Sir, know you not these towers and halls Watch where the foaming Conway falls? Who should these walls and towers own? And the wide woods and forest round, Even to Snowdon's utmost bound, Save the brave lord of Eglamore?” The knight explained his ignorance, He was a wanderer late from France. The page surveyed him o'er again; He thought the wily knight did feign: A deadly hue was on his cheek; His looks spoke more than words may speak. Yet to the page, though much it told, He read not all it might unfold. XXV. The knight perceived his doubting thought, And drew a badge forth from his breast; Some noble Order's golden crest, Upon a field of silver wrought. “This badge,” he said, “with blood was bought.” He turn'd with haughty frown away. The page did not more doubt betray; But service offered to undo His casque and linked harness true; But the stranger gravely said him Nay, And refused that night to disarray. XXVI. Wondering, yet fearing to demand, Why to these towers from distant land, The knight had come, without his train, Pondered the youth his doubts again; Again, as though his thoughts he read, The knight look'd sternly down and said, “My squire and my foot-page I missed At night-fall, when the woods betwixt. But they perchance may shelter find, From this bitter-blowing wind, In the deep hollow of some hill, Till the dawn break, and the storm be still.” XXVII. “But the wolf bays in the blast afar; Sir knight, how may they scape such war? I hear him now—he nearer howls! Mercy! mercy! save their souls!” “Hark!” said the knight, and stood aghast; It was no wolf-howl in the blast; It was a blood-hound's dreadful bay, The stranger heard, with such dismay— The blood-hound at the tower below; That over pathless hill and dale, Had tracked a murderer in the gale, And came to claim his master's foe. While listening to the lengthen'd yell, The stranger seemed to hear his knell. “A blood-hound loose, and at this hour! Your rest, sir knight, had ill been kept; Nor one within these gates had slept, Had I been in my distant tower.” The page he lighted a lamp on high; The stranger stifled scarce a sigh, That heavily for utterance pressed. He heard the page's steps descend, And go where the long chambers bend, Down to the halls, and th' outer walls. The page knew not the chance he ran; He was marked with the blood of a murder'd man! XXVIII. The knight, he listened in silent dread, Till now, the blood-hound's voice was stilled; But soon a low voice near him sped, That every nerve with horror thrilled. He looked the way that lone voice came, And saw, by the lamp's tall spiring flame, A portraiture on the wall beneath, Of noble dame, that seemed to breathe. Robed in sable weeds was she: The gleam fell on that lady's brow; There, written dimly, you might see, The characters of hopeless woe. XXIX. Soon as that lady's face he saw, All other dread his heart forsook; He gazed with fixt and frenzied awe, And vainly tried away to look: For to his fearful sight it seemed, As though her eyes on his were bent; And, where the pale flame wavering gleamed, As if her varying cheek were blent With lights and shades of death; While round her lips a grim smile drew, And the rose paled that on them blew; And, with faint lingering breath, “Prepare,” she said, “thy hour is nigh! Unpitying, thou hast seen me die; Unpitied be thy mortal sigh!” XXX. He heard the words—the words alone; He heard not that deep solemn groan; He heard not the clang of the 'larum bell, Nor from the gates that horn-blast swell; Nor heard the many-trampling hoofs, Nor voices calling in the gale, And ringing round the castle roofs, Till they made the 'battled raven quail; Nor heard the funeral shriek, that broke Through every hall and lofty tower; He heard alone the words she spoke. XXXI. Nor saw he in the court below, By the torches' umbered glow, Borne upon his bleeding bier, With wounds unclosed and open eyes, A warrior stretched in death draw near; Nor heard the loud and louder cries, This piteous sight of horror drew From every friend and vassal true. But he knew that voice at his chamber-door, And straight the witch-veil of glamour Falls, and his wonder-trance is o'er. He hears his summons in that sound; It is the bark of the true blood-hound. True to his murdered lord is he; He has traced the steps he could not see— Traced them o'er darkened miles and miles, O'er glen and mountain, wood and moor, Through all their swift and winding wiles, Till he stopped before his master's door, And bayed the murderer in his bower. XXXII. The castle gates were strait unbarred, And he sprang before his bleeding lord; He passed the page unheeded by, And tracked the stranger's steps on high; Till at the door, that closed him in, Loud and dread became his din. The doors are burst, and the spectre-light Betrayeth the form of the blood-tracked knight: He was armed all over in coat of mail, But nothing did steel that night avail; He fell a torn corpse, beside that chair, Whereunto the page did late appear, By the dark glamour-art revealed, His murdered lord with lance and shield. The murderer fell, and his death-wound found In the terrible fangs of the true blood-hound.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL III, IV. ST. ALBAN'S ABBEY: A POETICAL ROMANCE. Spirit of ancient days! who o'er these walls, Unseen and silent, hold'st thy solemn state, Thy presence known where the gloom deepest falls, And by th' unearthly thoughts that on thee wait: Descend, and touch my heart with thine own fire, And nerve my trembling fancy to aspire To the dread scenes that thou hast witnessed here! Teach me, in language simple and severe, (Such best may harmonize with ruder times) With place and circumstance of awful crimes, To paint th' awakening vision thou hast spread Before mine eyes—tale of the mighty dead! And let not modern polish throw the light Of living ray within thy vaults of night, But give thy elder words, whose sober glow, Like to th' illumined gloom of thine own aisles, Touching the mind with more than light may show, Wakes highest rapture while it darkly smiles. Presumptuous wish! Ah! not to me are given Those antients keys, that ope the Poet's heaven, Golden and rustless! Not to me are given! But, if not mine the prize, not mine the crime Lightly to scorn them, nor the simple chime, Though tuneless oft, when to the scene more true Than flowing verse, bright with Castalian dew. Like Grecian goddess, placed in Saxon choir, Is the false union of the cadenced rhime And measured sweetness of the tempered lyre With subjects darkened by the shroud of Time. As Gothic saint sleeping in Grecian fane Is ancient story, shrined in polished strain; Truth views th' incongruous scene with stern farewell, And startled Fancy weeps and breaks her spell. CANTO I. THE ABBEY. I. Know ye that pale and ancient choir, Whose Norman tower lifts it's pinnacled spire? Where the long Abbey-aisle extends And battled roof o'er roof ascends; Cornered with buttresses, shapely and small, That sheltered the Saint in canopied stall; And, lightened with hanging turrets fair, That so proudly their dental coronals wear, They blend with a holy, a warlike air; While they guard the Martyr's tomb beneath, And patient warriors, laid in death? II. Know ye that transept's far-stretched line, Where stately turrets, more slenderly fine, Each with a battlement round it's brow, Win the uplifted eye below? How lovely peers the soft blue sky Through their small double arch on high! Deepening the darkness of it's shade, And seeming holier peace to spread. More grandly those turrets, mossed and hoar, Upon the crimson evening soar. Yet lovelier far their forms appear When they lift their heads in the moonlight air; And softening beams of languid white Tip their shadowy crowns with light. But most holy their look, when a fleecy cloud O'er them throws it's trembling shroud, Then palely thinly dies away, And leaves them to the full bright ray. Thus Sorrow fleets from Resignation's smile; The virtue lives—the suffering dies the while. III. And, as these moonlight-towers we trace, A living look, a saintly grace Beams o'er them, when we seem to hear The midnight-hymn breathe soft and clear, As from this choir of old it rose. Each hallowed thought they seem to own, Expressed by music's heavenly tone; And patient, sad, and pale and still, As if resign'd to wait Time's will. Such choral swell and dying close Stole on the Abbot's hour of rest, Like solemn air from spirit blest, And shaped his vision of repose. The pious instinct of his soul, Not even slumber might control: Soon as he caught the distant lay, His gathering thoughts half woke to pray; Celestial smile came o'er his brow, Though sealed in sleep the lid below; And, when in silence died the strain, The lingering prayer His lips forbear, And deep his slumbers fall again. IV. Bold is this Abbey's front, and plain; The walls no shrined saint sustain, Nor tower, nor airy pinnet crown; But broadly sweeps the Norman arch Where once in brightened shadow shone King Offa, on his pilgrim-march And proudly points the mouldered stone Of the high-vaulted porch beneath, Where Norman beauty hangs a wreath Of simple elegance and grace; Where slender columns guard the space On every side, in clustered row, The triple arch through arch disclose, And lightly o'er the vaulting throw The thwart-rib and the fretted rose. Beside this porch, on either hand, Giant buttresses darkly stand, And still their silent vanguard hold For bleeding Knights, laid here of old; And The busts of Offa and his Queen are at the springs of the arch of the great porch. Mercian Offa and his Queen The portal's guard and grace are seen. This western front shows various style, Less ancient than the central pile. No furrows deep upon its brow The frown of seven stern centuries show; Yet the sad grandeur of the whole Gives it such a look of soul, That, when upon it's silent walls The silvered grey of moonlight falls, And the fixed image dim appears, It seems some shade of parted years Left watching o'er the mouldering dead, Who here for pious Henry bled, And here, beneath the wide-stretched ground Of nave, of choir, of chapels round, For ever—ever, rest the head. V. Now know ye this pale and ancient Choir, Where the massy tower lifts a slender spire? Here forty abbots have ruled and one, Twenty with pall and mitre on, And bowed them to the Pope alone. Their hundred monks, in black arrayed, The Benedictine rules obeyed; O'er distant lands they held their sway; Freed from Peter's-pence were they; The gift of palle from Pope they claimed, And Cardinal-Abbots were they named; And even old Canterbury's lord Was long refused the premier board; For this was the first British Martyr's bier, And the Pope said “His priest shall have no peer:” Now know ye St. Alban's bones rest here. VI. Kings and heroes here were guests In stately halls, at solemn feasts. But now, nor dais, nor halls remain; Nor fretted window's gorgeous pane Twilight illuminated throws Where once the high-served banquet rose. VII. No fragment of a roof remains To echo back their wassail strains; But the long aisles, whose holy gloom Still mourns and veils the martyr's tomb. The broad grey tower, the turrets wide, Scattered o'er tower and transept, guide The distant traveller to their throne, Where they high-seated watch alone, And seem, with aspect sad, to tell, That they of all their Abbey's power Remain to point, where heroes fell, And monarch met his evil hour, And guileless, meek, and pious, bowed To doubtful right's victorious crowd. VIII. Now, if this cloister, fallen and gone, Ye fain would view, as once it shone, Pace ye, with reverend step, I pray, The grass-grown and forgotten way, While murmurs low the fitful wind, Winning to peace the meeken'd mind; And Evening, in her solemn stole, With stillness o'er those woods afar, Leads in blue shade her brightening star, As spreads the slow gloom from the pole, And these old towers their watch more awful keep, (Where once the Curfew spoke with solemn rule) And the faint hills and all the valley sleep In misty grey beneath the “dewy cool.” Yet, if a worldly heart ye wear, These visioned-shades forbear—forbear! To thee no dim-seen halls may gleam, For thee no hallowed tapers beam On the pale visage through the gloom Bending in prayer by shrine, or tomb. Turn thou thy wearied step away; Go thou where dance and song are gay, Or where the sun is flaming high, And leave these scenes to Evening's sigh. IX. But ye, with measured step and slow, Whose smile is shaded soft with woe; And ye, who holy joy can know, The glow beyond all other glow,— Ye, whose high spirit dares to dwell Beyond the reach of earthly spell, And tread upon the dizzy verge Of unknown worlds; or downward urge, Through ages dim, your steadfast sight, And trace their shapes of shadowed light, O come “with meek submitted thought,” With lifted eye, by Rapture taught, And o'er your head the gloom shall rise Of monkish chambers, still and wide, As once they stood; and to your eyes Group after group shall slowly glide, And here again their duties ply, As they were wont, long ages by. The twilight broods not yet so deep, But we may trace where now they sleep Beneath the sullen turf, aloof, And where each solemn chamber's roof Drew it's strong vaulting o'er their frames, But urged on human praise no claims, Nor always bore their living names. X. On yonder brow, that fronts the West, Where glimmering beams in stillness rest, Once rose the Abbot's Hall of Right, That wont to view Ver's stream below And shallow valley westward go To farthest hills, that owned his might; And from those farthest hills were seen, Through oaken boughs of stretching green, The fretted window of that hall, The pinnacle, that crowned it's wall, And seemed to watch it's portal grey, With crimson light tinged by the setting ray. XI. Thus rose the Abbot's vaulted Hall, Where he, in virtue of the palle, Spoke doom to all his vassal throng; For life and death were on his tongue, And scarce less ready to fulfill His worldly, than his better will, Were peasant, vavasour, and knight, From London's wall to Beechwood's height. His weighty robe of velvet fold Was 'broidered round, and clasped with gold A Prior helped his office to sustain, A hundred monks did dignify his reign. Pale were they and closely shorn, Heedless they were of human scorn And arts that wait on human pride; In patience each with other vied. 'Mong such had Matthew Paris stood, Pious, learned, wise and good, Though shrouded in a bigot's hood. XII. Here, where the deeper shadows fall, Once echoed o'er the paved hall The weary step and staff of him, Who, at this lonely hour and dim, The last chill hour of eventide, Had heard from yonder bleak hill side, Where once stood Roman Verulam, Faint o'er the wintry waters come The bell of Compline, chiming slow From forth this Abbey's unseen tower, And spied, amid the shades below, The hearth-blaze in the stranger's bower; For here the Pilgrim's Lodge arose, Whose porch and hall and parlour warm And well-closed chambers of repose Received him from the rushing storm. XIII. And, when he reached the cheering blaze, How sweet to think upon those ways, As the shrill wind and sleety rain Against the casements strove in vain. But crowding thoughts soon chased repose, And nigh to sacred rapture rose, As now he knew himself so near The object of his long career, And, safely placed, where all around Was ancient, consecrated ground; The precinct sought o'er sea and shore,— The grave of him, whose sufferings o'er Had now their glorious triumph found! XIV. There the Scriptorium spread it's gloom, To dead and living, like one tomb; The living there like dead might show, So mutely sat they, ranged in row; Scarce seen to move, from hour to hour, Copying the written folio rare, Or tracing bird, or curious flower, Round blessed Mary in her bower, In splendid gold and colours fair, On missal leaf, with painful care, Or portraiture of Donor good, That, closely kept and seldom viewed, Still fresh and glorious should be For century following century. XV. Others there were, who volumes bound In silk, or velvet, 'broidered round And 'bossed with gold and gems of price, Enclasped with emerald palm-leaf thrice. On the high window near would shine, Transparent, the memorial line Of him, who once had wrought below, With patient hand and earnest brow; Him, whose small pencil thus enshrined In book of Golden Record true, The image and the noble mind, And thanks to benefactor due. There shadowed Kings and Abbots pass, In crowned pomp, or sweeping palle, Like spectres o'er some wizard's glass. There, as the lifted pages fall, They rise to view and disappear, As year steals silent after year, Till came the blank leaf, turned o'er all! Even o'er him, while here he wrought On the dull page the living thought. In after-time were here impressed Those wondrous characters combined, That stamp upon the paper vest At once, the image of the mind. The second Abbey this in all the land, That stretched to learning a preserving hand. XVI. Here cloister-walks, in spacious square, Showed sacred story, painted fair, And portraiture of famous men, Who seemed to live and speak again, In golden maxims from the walls. Nobly these cloisters ranged along By chapels, chambers, courts and halls, Dividing from the cowled throng, As with a dim and pillared aisle, The Royal lodging's stately pile. There the Queen's parlour, and her bower, Hung o'er the sunny southern glade; And here the place of monarch-power Gleamed through the Abbey's farther shade. The foliaged arch, the well-carved door Of chamber, hung from vault to floor With storied scene, or cloth of gold, Or 'broidered velvet's purple fold, Rose beauteous to the taste of yore. And slender shafts, entwined with flowers, Lifted their high o'er-arching bowers, Traced forth with mimic skill so true, Kings seemed their Windsor's groves to view. XVII. The high-carved chimney's canopy Spread broad o'er half a blazing tree, With pinnacle and mitre wrought And shielded arms of Mercia's court, Three royal crowns; and blazonry Of many an abbot lying near In choir, or cloister, on his bier. High in the midst a marble form Stood in it's tabernacle shade, Pale as the gleam of April storm; Oft was the passing monk afraid; So sternly watched the downcast eye! Yet hardly might such monk know why. On the brow a kingly crown it wore, In it's hand a Mercian sceptre bore; 'Twas Offa stood there on his fretted throne, Whom these holy walls for their founder own, Who Charlemagne for foe and friend had known. And in that chamber, not in vain, With mullions light and roial pane, Rose th' oriel window's triple arch, That pictured forth the solemn march Of Offa, with his pilgrim train. XVIII. Within these walls there was one scene, Where worldly matters were discussed; It was the Prior's cloister-green; There ruled he, by the Abbot's trust. For not amid the noise of men, Disturbed by their familiar ken, Dwelt the Lord Abbot; his recess Was little easy of access; No; by the southern transept rose (The shelves with store of learning fraught) His Lodge and Cloister of repose, His bower, where all apart he sought, From convent-state and homage free, Leisure and learned dignity. XIX. Lost now that Study's farther shade, Whose peace no stray step might invade, Nor any sound of breathing life, Save when the Choir, in faint, sweet strife Of voice and citole offering Praise, such as Angel-bands might sing, In lessening chorus, on their way, Ascending to Eternal Day, Were heard with joyful murmuring, Their pure, harmonious strains to bring. It's deep, perspective shade is gone, That led, where the rich oriel shone, Where golden gloom the stained glass shed O'er the lone Abbot's bended head, As, sitting in his ebon chair, Lulled by sweet harmonies afar, He mused on death and life to come, The dawn of peace beyond the tomb, Or called back years, that o'er his head had rolled, And knew himself for one, whose tale is told! So still his form, so fixed his look, As dwelt his pale eyes o'er his book, So true, so clearly might you trace The lines of thought upon his face, He seemed some shade, that loves to dwell Where late it's mortal substance fell— To linger in the living scene, Where erst it's cares, it's joys had been; The while each shuddering sigh of air, That breathed upon the ivy near, Passed o'er the Vision's patient head, Like whisper of the spirit fled. XX. Far distant rose those walls upon the light, The stately walls, with tapestry richly dight, Of th' Abbot's Banquet-hall, where, as on throne, He sat at the high dais, like prince, alone, Save when a Royal guest came here, Or Papal Legate claimed a chair. Here marble platforms, flight o'er flight, Slow rising through the long-lined view, Showed tables, spread at different height, Where each for different rank he knew. And, with pleased glance, adown the hall, Saw Bishops in their far-sought palle, The Abbey's noble Seneschal, Barons and Earls, in gold array, And warrior Knights, in harneys grey. There was the Prior's delegated sway. The grave Archdeacon sat below, And th' hundred Monks, in row and row; Not robed in dismal sable they Upon a high and festal day, But all in copes most costly and most gay. There, too, the Abbey-Marshal shone, And there, beside the Abbot's throne, Chaplain of Honour from the Pope, alone. XXI. Thus the Lord-Abbot, were he proud, Might muse upon the chequered crowd; Nor always did his mind disdain The worldly honours, though so vain. His board with massive plate was laid, And rare inventions it displayed; Each sewer-monk his homage paid With bended knee and bowed head, And Latin verse, half sung, half said On every platform, as he rose Through the long hall to it's high close, Where frankincense from golden urns In light wreath round the Abbot burns. The chaunted Latin grace was sung With pomp of instruments, that rung The arched roofs and screens among. And, when a Royal guest was there, The Abbot, rising from his chair, Blessed, with spread hands, the ordered feast, While reverend stood each princely guest, And far adown the hall might see Knights, Bishops, Earls, on bended knee.XXII. And when came up, at old Yule-tide, The boar's head, trimmed with garlands gay, With shining holly's scarlet pride, And the sweet-scented rosemary, O! then what merry carols rung, What choral lays the minstrels sung! Marching before it through the hall, Led by the stately Seneschal. This was the joyous minstrel's call, In Leonine with English strung: “Caput Apri defero. “The boar's head in hand bring I “With garlands gay and rosemary; “I pray you, all sing merrily, “Qui estis in convivio.” XXIII. Then, every voice in chorus joined Of those who sat in festal row. You might have heard it on the wind— Heard it o'er hills of desert snow. Thence might be seen, in vale below, Through windows of that Banquet-hall, The mighty Yule-Clough blazing clear, And the Yule-Tapers, huge and tall, Lighting the roofs with timely cheer. But, ere a few brief hours were sped, The blaze was gone—the guests were fled. And heavy was the Winter's sigh, As those lone walls it passed by. XXIV. Now, ere the Abbot's feast began, Or yet appeared the crane and swan, The solemn Carver, with his keen Knife, and well armed with napkins clean, Scarf-wise athwart his shoulder placed, And on each arm and round his waist, Came, led by Marshal, to the dais. There every trencher he assays, O'er the Great Salt makes flourishes, Touches each spoon and napkin fair, Assaying whether ill lurk there, Ere he present it to his lord, Or offer it at the Rewarde. The Sewer, half-kneeling on his way, Of every dish receives assaye At the high board, as guard from guile, The Marshal waiting by the while, And ancient carols rising slow From the young Choir and Monks below. And thus, as every course came on, These pomps an awful reverence won. XXV. Soon as the last high course was o'er, The Chaplain from the cupboard bore, With viands from the tables stored, The Alms-Dish to the Abbot's board, And ample loaf, and gave it thence, With due form and good countenance, That th' Almoner might it dispense. Next came the Cup-bearers, with wine, Malmsey and golden metheglin, With spice-cake and with wafers fine. This o'er, when surnaps all were drawn, And solemn grace again was sung, Came golden ewer and bason, borne In state to the high board along. XXVI. But, at high tide, ere all was past, Marched the huge Wassail-bowl the last, Obedient to the Abbot's call, Borne by the Steward of the hall; The Marshal with his wand before And streamers gay and rosemary, And choral carols sounding o'er. 'Twas set beside the father's dais, Where oft the Deacon, in his place, Who bearer of the grace-cup was, Filled high the cordial Hippocras From out that bowl of spicery, And served the Abbot on his knee; Then, sent around to every board This farewell-wassail from his lord. The Abbot, tasting of the wine, Rose from his chair, in wonted sign The feast was o'er; yet stood awhile In cheerful converse with high guest, Who from the tables round him pressed Then, with a kind and gracious smile, The wassail and the board he blessed, Ere yet he left the gorgeous scene, And sought the tranquil shade within. XXVII. Here, with proud grace, did Wolsey stand, Signing forth blessings with his hand, And oft the grace-cup had allowed To move among the willing crowd. Grandeur sat on his steadfast brow, 'Mid high Imagination's glow; He seemed to feel himself the lord Of all who sat beside his board, And, whether Peer, or Prince, or King, 'Twas meet to him they homage bring; And homage willed they, since his pride Had genius, judgement, taste, for guide. Which held it in such fine control, Pride seemed sublimity of soul. XXVIII. Short while the Abbot did repose, When he had left the Banquet-hall; For soon, where his arched chamber rose, Would other pageant-scenes disclose On days of convent festival. Here, on the Martyr's annual feast When Obits at his shrine had ceased; When Give-Ale and the Dole were o'er; When Robin Hood had left his bower, And in the Convent's spacious court The morrice-dancers ceased their sport, And on the rout was closed the Abbey-door; Then torch and taper, blazing clear Within the Abbot's evening room, Banished the heavy, wintry gloom; And Mysteries were acted here. Then, Chronicle of Kings, pourtrayed From England's story, long gone by, In mimic garb and scene arrayed Awoke the brethren's solemn sigh; Such as we breathe o'er these, our theme, Whelmed in the ever-passing stream. XXIX. Here, too, the Minstrels' chaunted song Told of their sainted Alban's fate; But, oft the measure wound along With tales of Chivalry's high state, Of knights, of ladies and of love, Ambition's eagle, Beauty's dove, And many a lay of Holy Land, Of Richard's and of Edward's band. The harpers, in the noble train Of Abbey guest, oft joined the strain; And, as they woke with fire the lay, Or bade it's moving grief decay, Each silent monk, with look attent, His head, unhooded, thoughtful, bent. Then might you watch, in the stern eye, The busy, fretful passions die, Such as in gloom and loneness dwell, Gnawing the bosom's vital cell, And spreading poison through the soul, That yields to their malign control. XXX. 'Twas sweet the softened mind to trace Beaming upon time-hardened face, Won by still harmony to rest; And all unconscious of the tear, That, stranger to such brow severe, Upon the closing eyelid pressed. But sweeter 'twas to mark the smile Of the blind Minstrel o'er the strings; Darkness, nor want, he knows the while, As wide the storied verse he flings; For Music can all wants beguile, With bright perception chase his night, And can awake that glow of heart, Affection's dearest smiles impart; For Music is—the blind man's light! The beam, that does to mental ray Image and sentiment display, The world of passion, living thought, All that the mind through sight ere sought. Then sigh not, that he dwells in night, For he hath Music for his light! XXXI. This vaulted chamber once was lined With arras rich, where stood combined The story of Cologne's Three Kings, With other far-famed ancient things. Yet oft, on solemn festival, A deeper tale spoke from the wall, Such as might aid the mimic show Enacted on the scene below; Where the raised platform, near the Bay, Served well for stage. That oriel gay Rose with light leaves and columns tall, Mid roial glass and fretwork small; While tripod lamps from the coved roof Showed well each painted mask aloof, Lanfranc and Saxon Edward there, Watching the scene they once could share. XXXII. That oriel shed bright influence And charm, by its magnificence, On all there told by eye, or tongue, Morality, or Mystery, Or Founder's boon, or History. In front, the velvet curtain, flung In folds aside, not then for shade, Or shelter, as when winds invade, Made graceful ornament between The roof and the fictitious scene. How different from this festal grace, How fit it's blandishments to chase, Were the long vistas, ranging here Of the Great Cloister's pillared square. XXXIII. And when could festal joy e'er vie With the calm rapture of the sigh Breathed in that Cloister's solemn shade, When the lone monk would muse and read, And meditate on ancient lore, Or view the warrior on his tomb, With raised hands seeming to implore Of Heaven a mitigated doom? So shaded would such figure lie, Tall arches pointing o'er the head, That, though a window, placed on high, It's gleam through distant colours shed,— So dim would lie in shades below, That, whether living shape, or dead, The monk, who gazed, might hardly know. And often, at the midnight-watch, (The shrine-watch in the aisle beside) His ear attent low sound would catch, That stole along the tomb and died, As though he had some holy word In whisper from the marble heard! Followed a stillness all profound; Was it some spirit from the ground That breathed a spell of death around? If the monk watched some little space, Life would seem trembling o'er the face! The pallid stone would change it's hue, And tremble to his doubting view! XXXIV. Gone is that Cloister's shadowy walk, Where the more aged would pace and talk, Or, resting in the well-carved nook, Leisurely read the rare lent book, Turning each page with reverend care. Th' illuminator's work to spare; Or tell some legend of a saint, Or allegory, little worth, Of monkish virtues pictured forth In leonine, of Latin quaint. Whate'er it were, 'twas fine repose, In cloister-shade, at evening close, To lean along that oaken seat, And, all enwrapt in quiet gloom, Hear the still Vesper, rising sweet From sainted Oswyn's shrine and tomb, Or Obit from the chantry near Of the good Abbot Delamere, Swell faint and die upon the ear. And solemn 'twas and sweet, the while, To mark upon some distant aisle, Seen through deep arch of transept-door, The streaming torch-light break the shade, Strike the tall arches over head, Or, slanting low that long aisle o'er, Show, some dim sepulchre before, The lonely, duteous mourner there, Kneeling and veiled in watch of prayer. XXXV. There, ranged around in silent guard, Seventeen kings yet watch and ward The good Duke Humphrey's mouldering form, Here rescued from the earthly storm, Raised by a rival—now a worm! And, when the midnight chaunts were still, Strange sounds the vault below would fill. A ghastly shade, with mitred head, Has stalked, that lonely tomb around, And knelt upon the honoured ground, With hands upon its white palle spread, In seeming prayer and penance lost; 'Twas guessed this was a murderer's ghost, Condemned to wander round the grave Of him, whom kindness could not save. There were, who in that shade could see (Or 'twas the moonbeam's mockery) Beaufort of cruel memory! Such look as dying he had shown, When hope of Heaven he did not own, And Horror stared beside his bed; Such grisly look this visage had. XXVI. And, at such hour, was sometimes seen, Veiled in thin shadowy weeds of woe, The image of a stately Queen, Near the cold marble pacing slow. The crown upon her hair gleamed faint, And more of heroine than saint Was drawn upon her lofty brow. The proud, heroic graces there, The grandeur of her step and air, No softer charms of pity share. Alas! that such commanding mind Were not with truth and mercy joined! Now, were her look, her eye of fire, That once could warlike bands inspire, Dimmed with the tear of vain remorse: Far less had been a kingdom's loss, Than loss of holy innocence; So said her fixed and anguished countenance. XXXVII. But Margaret's moan, nor Beaufort's word, Was heard at Vesper's hallowed hour To musing monk, in cloister-bower; Pious sounds alone he heard, And listened oft, with saintly smile, When Autumn's gale swept o'er the aisle, And bore the swelling hymn away Up to the realms of heavenly day! But, when the fitful gust was gone, Rose that strain with a sweeter tone; The hymn of Peace it seemed to be— Her hushed and meekest minstrelsy— Her welcome to the Just, when free From this short world of misery. The monk, who listened, many a still tear shed, By trembling Hope and blessed Pity fed; The listener's self how soon among the dead! XXXVIII. But who the changing scenes may tell This Abbey's ancient walls have known! When London tolled the Plague's death-bell, Justice here held her courts alone; Here, in this nave, was placed her throne. An earlier age showed scenes more dread, For shrines and tombs around were spread With bleeding knights and nobles dead. Next age, the latter Henry's bands Each consecrated altar spoiled, Seized on the Abbey's ample lands, And recklessly for plunder toiled. Then, nearer to the living day, Here other spoilers bore the sway, Who, feigning Reason for their guide, Indulged an impious, bigot pride. All arrogant in their chicane, They dared these reverend walls profane. Then Cromwell's bands on grave-stones lay, And storied brasses tore away; The sculptured marble tombs defaced Of those, who, nameless, sleep below; That the tall arch, with web-work traced That shadowed form of Prophet graced, Was shattered by their impious blow. XXXIX. Of all this Abbey's ample bound One outer arch alone is found, To mark the Convent's stately port, The entrance of the western court, Beneath whose arch have passed the trains Of Kings succeeding Kings, when strains From trump and clarion, as from fort, Have shook the massy walls around, And startled with the warrior-sound The penanced monk, in distant cell, (He had his long beads twice to tell, Nor knew what form he muttered then,)— While forth, to meet their Sovereign, The Abbot and his convent paced, With time-worn banners, ranged in haste. XL. Then from the convent-hall within Faint might be heard the joyous din Of minstrel-harp and choral voice, That for the royal-guest rejoice; And then the painted window bright, Lighting, on high, the murky night, And showing portraiture of Saint, Kind signal to the Pilgrim faint; But to the robber, in his cell Of giant-oak, it told too well, That richly-dight and jewelled guest Would late return to distant rest. The darkened vale and subject-town Viewed such bright vision with a frown, And murmured, that the tyrant knell Of iron Curfew should compel Their homes to sink in sudden night, When e'en the turret, whence it spoke, Insulting those who owned the yoke, Lifted it's brow, all ruddy bright, Flushed from the Abbey-Hall's strong light. XLI. But, though these lighted halls are gone, And darkly stands that tower and lone, The sacred temple still endures; A truer worship it secures. And, though the gorgeous shrines are o'er, And their pale watch-monks now no more; Though torch, nor voice, from chantry-tomb, Break, solemn, through the distant gloom; Though pilgrim-trains no more ascend Where far-seen arches dimly bend, And fix in awe th' admiring eye Upon the Martyr's crown, on high, And watch upon his funeral-bed; Nor hundred Monks, by Abbot led, Through aisle and choir, by tomb and shrine, Display the long-devolving line, To notes of solemn minstrelsy, And hymns, that o'er the vaulting die Yet, we here feel the inward peace, That in long-reverenced places dwells; Our earthly cares here learn to cease; The Future all the Past expels. And still, so solemn falls the shade, Where once the weeping Palmer prayed, We feel, as o'er the graves we tread, His thrill of reverential dread. XLII. Thou silent Choir, whose only sound Is whispering step o'er graves around, Or echo faint from vault, on high, Of the poor redbreast's minstrelsy, Who, perched on some carved mask of stone, By lofty gallery dim and lone, Sends sweet, short note, but sparely heard, That sounds e'en like the farewell word Of some dear friend, whose smile in vain We seek through tears to view again! Thou holy shade—unearthly gloom! That hoverest o'er the Martyr's tomb; Ye awful vaults, whose aspect wears The ghastliness of parted years! The very look, the steadfast frown, That ye on ages past sent down, Strange, solemn, wonderful and dread, Pageant of living and of dead;— Thou silent Choir! thou holy shade! Ye walls, that guard the Martyr's head, Meet agents are ye to inspire The lone enthusiast's thought of fire; High ministers of Alban's fame, Ye are his tomb, and breathe his name. XLIII. And when, enthroned on field of war, This Abbey's walls are seen afar, When it's old dark-drawn aisles extend Upon the light; and, bold and broad, The central tower is seen t' ascend, And sternly look their sovereign lord, We feel again such transports rise, As fixed that way-worn Palmer's eyes, When, gaining first the toilsome brow, Rose to his sight the Shrine below, When, as he caught it's aspect pale, He shouted “Alban! Martyr! hail!” And knelt and wept, and kissed the long-sought ground. END OF THE FIRST CANTO. CANTO II. THE NIGHT BEFORE THE FIRST BATTLE. I. Amidst these old abodes of peace Did War his crimson banner rear, And bid the heavenly anthem cease, While his stern trumpets rent the air? Here, in each cloister, hall and walk, Where sandalled feet unheard went by, And voices low, in reverend talk, Feared to disturb it's sanctity, Did here the Warrior's iron tread Shake the cold slumber of the dead, Call murmurs from the vaults below And the long whispered sigh of woe; Stalk o'er the helpless and the good, And print the hermit's vest with blood? Yes; blood the hallowed pavement stained; And blood the shrine of peace prophaned! The ring of mail—the clash of steel Through choir and cloister sent their peal To chambers dim, where Silence slept, And pious men their sabbath kept, Who, long secure from sense of ill, And well subdued in mind and will, Pondered Futurity's high theme And this world's strange and fleeting dream. II. O day of guilt and bleeding woe! Year after year shall mourn in vain The countless ills, that from ye flow, And hardly hope for peace again— The day, when York and Lancaster First loosed the tide of civil war; When hostile brothers of the land Met face to face, and hand to hand, And sunk each other's lance beneath, And breathed each other's dying breath! III. The eve before that battle day, The camp of either army lay Beyond where now the straining sight Can reach from Alban's utmost height. 'Twas leaning on this very tower, That Alban's Monks watched hour by hour. They, who lie dark in death below Yon fallen walls, in silent row Gazed, as you gaze, from this high brow. The cowl and helmet, side by side, Watched from this height the bannered pride, And marked the gathering storm of war Hang dark o'er all those hills afar; And, in dread stillness of the soul, Heard the low, threatening thunder roll, That soon would, in it's cloudy course, Burst round their walls with lightning-force. IV. Camped o'er those green and northern lands, There lay Duke Richard's way-worn bands; The pale rose on their ensigns stood. Southward, where now the clear sun shines, Watched Royal Henry's warrior-lines, Surmounted with the rose of blood. His vanguard lay beneath these halls, And round St. Stephen's neighbouring walls. To Cashio's vale his centre spread, Where the King pressed a thorny bed. His legions stretched toward Stanmore's brow And Harrow's lofty sanctuary, Whose spiry top you just may know, Crowned with many a stately tree, Where now the gleam falls fleetingly. The lights and shades of Fortune's power Fell not as Nature's at this hour. Her storm frowned on the southern scene; Her smile shone o'er yon flowery green. Those distant downs, now dim and grey, Those misty woods received her ray. V. While the Monks from this battlement Their glance o'er the wide prospect sent, They watched the western sun go down 'Mid clouds of amber, edged with gold, That did their splendid wings unfold, And seemed to wait around his throne. A monk, who marked them, dared foretell, That gentle Peace would here still dwell; But the bold guess and flattering ray Sunk alike in gloom away. One crimson streak of parted day Lingered where Henry's army lay; Till o'er it spread the night's dark hue, That veiled awhile each camp from view. VI. Then, gradual, through the deepening gloom, Torch and signal-fires relume The war-lines on the hills and dells, Leaving wide shadowy intervals; Yet marking to the distant eye How broad and close those camp-lines lie: Gleaming as does the Ocean's bed, When sun has set in stormy red, And surge on surge rolls crested bright, Beneath the glance of parting light. VII. The other camp, of smaller force, Concealed it's boundary by the course Of heights, save where one hill retired; There was the dusk with redness fired By casual watch-torch through the gloom; And there lay York, like hidden doom, Waiting to send forth nameless woes. High o'er that hill the blaze uprose Upon the darkly-sullen sky, Here reddening on a livid cloud, There glancing like the fancied crowd, That ride the northern lights on high. Duke Richard watched upon this hill, While his camp-field was dark and still; But that a guard-fire, here and there, Lifted it's lonely fitful glare, Where steeds and warriors lay around In harness for the battle-day, Half-slumbering to the frequent sound Of steps and weapons on the ground, Preparing for the morrow's fray. His scouts near Henry's army strolled, And to his gathered Council told Where lay it's weakness, where it's hold. But Henry, trusting to his force, Scorned such dark cares and secret course. VIII. So near the outer posts approached, That each on each at times encroach'd, And speech of taunt, or civil cheer, Mixed with the clink of harness-gear, Was heard; and each might view the flare From Alban's topmost round in air, That made the tower, in lurid gloom, A more gigantic port assume. And, silent, on the rocky steep Their watch o'er hill and valley keep. Each, too, might see dim forms on high, Glide, where the beacon touched the sky: For there it's flame of sullen red Flashed on a cowled monk's sable head, Glanced on the Abbey-knight beside, And showed his plumy crest of pride, On the night-breezes dancing gay, As though in sun and chivalry. IX. That monk and knight, with steady gaze, Watched where the far-off signals blaze, O'er many a ridge of wood and down, From heath and camp, from tower and town; From ancient Hadley's cresset-flame, That peered o'er hills, an eastern star, (The beacon-turret still the same) Bearing this sign of iron war To Cashio's close-surrounded vale And Gorhambury's turrets pale, And nameless lands, in shade unknown. The nearer scene they looked upon, Glimmer'd in varying shade and light, Thrown from the Abbey's beacon bright. X. It gleamed on stately bowers below, Tinged porch and transept's dusky brow, Glared on broad courts and humble cell, Glanced on the crystal Oriel, And cast deep shadow on the ground From gates and turrets ranged around. There, Abbey Lance-men slowly paced, Where scarce the portal-arch was traced, As flashed the blaze along the air, And quivered on each Warrior's spear; Long, shaded walks it showed, that led Where cloister-plat and gardens spread, And monks, wrapt close in sable weed, Passed to and fro, with fearful speed. The gloomy light was thrown so far, It reddened dark St. Michael's brow, Frowning on Roman foss below, And tinged the bridge and streams of Ver. XI. St. Alban's town, with wakeful eyes, Viewed the red beacon sink and rise, And, sought to spell each signal sent To good King Henry's distant tent. And, while they gazed, the changing glare, Broad on each roof and lattice-bar, Showed every visage watching there For tiding of the threatened war. Upon Queen Ellen's pile of state, That crowned the town and mourned her fate, The trembling gleam touched shrine and saint With light and shade, so finely faint, The form beneath each canopy Appeared to lean so patiently, As if it bent o'er the loved bier, That, once for short time placed here, Had made the spot to Edward dear, And listened, while the Requiem's flow Shed stillness o'er the mourner's woe. XII. Patient upon the Abbey-Tower, From Vesper to the Matin hour, The knight and monk the first watch kept, While few beneath their vigil slept. Later, within the turret-head, The monk from the chill night-wind fled; But never from that platform's height Strayed the due footstep of the knight. With patient eye and measured pace, He turned upon the narrow space, And listened each imperfect sound, That rose from camp, or road, around, Or noise of preparation made Below in porch and arch-way shade. The massy bolts and ponderous bars Of studded gates, that, in old wars, Against the rebel townsmen closed, Had now so long in peace reposed, So long had been unmoved by hand, They now the Warder's might withstand. Often was heard the mingled din From clink of smith and voice within, From footsteps heavy with the weight Of chest, that bore from shrines a freight, And altar-tombs, to secret hold Of jewels rich and cups of gold; Though yet was left some little show To check, if need, the plunderer's blow. XIII. And, when such busy sounds were o'er, That Abbey-knight might hear once more From the still street, in echoing swell, The watch-word of each sentinel Pass on it's far-extending range From post to post, with ordered change, Now low, now sullen, and now high, “Health to the King!”—then “So say I.” And sometimes, too, a distant drum, With stealthy murmur seemed to come, Then rolled away, and sunk afar Where slept the thunder-cloud of war. From roads was heard and doubted ground The watch-cry of patrols around, Mingled, at times, with one slow note, Swelled solemn from the cornet's throat, And answered faint and fainter still, Like echo from the distant hill. And, when such solemn sounds were past, When slumbered e'en the midnight blast, The due hymn from the choir below Through the high tower ascended slow, While round the bands of Havock lay, Waiting but for the morn of May To light War, Death, and Treason to their prey. XIV. The Knight sent frequent message down, That all was still, No sign of ill Drew nearer to St. Alban's town. The while the Abbot, in debate, Sat with his officers of State, And Seneschal, Judge of his Court, Discussing every new report And message, sent from scouts afar, That told the visage of the war. Vainly for some they waited long, Perplexed Duke Richard's hosts among; Others came, horse on horse, so fast, That every quarter-watch that passed, Brought rumour fresh and wond'rous tale, Bidding now hope, now fear, prevail, And still most wond'rous ever was the last. XV. The pious Abbot, Whetehampsted, Of learned men the learned head, Closed a late council, and withdrew, Needful, though short repose to woo; But still the Prior and Seneschal Waited the worst, that might befall, Ready, if enemy approach, For council at the Abbot's couch. He, wakeful long and anxious still, Lost not in sleep his sense of ill, For then, in slumbers, touched with sorrow, He saw dim visions of the morrow, Saw round those walls the battle bleed; Heard the fierce trump and neigh of steed; Saw wounded Henry, in the strife, Borne down and pleading for his life, And, starting at the piteous view, He woke, with chill brow bathed in dew. XVI. That night, few monks their pallets pressed, And scarce an eye was closed in rest; Most were from slumber held away By terror of the coming day; Yet some there were, who, fond of change And slaves to envy, wished to see The battle take it's direst range, Though round their walls it chanced to be; And some, who, fired with worldly zeal, Would fain, with casque and sword of steel, Mingle in royal Henry's train; And others Richard's plea maintain. But each, by prudent council swayed, Or policy, their chief obeyed. The ordered chime was hourly rung; Each mass was duly said and sung; And, at each gate, though armed band Obeyed an Abbey-knight's command, And o'er the posterns had control, Yet, at each station watched a cowl, And still on tower, half hid in hood, The pale Monk with the Warrior stood. XVII. That Monk had heard the Vesper-bell Call every brother from his cell; Had heard the bell of Compline sound, And followed every service round; And as he heard each chaunt ascend, Silent and meek, his head would bend; Each word th' accustomed mind supplied, That distance to his ear denied; Though absent he, by painful need, He joined the prayer and dropped the bead. And oft, in silent orison, He prayed, that war might spare this town; That all who dwelt within these walls Might duly own Religion's calls On the unknown to-morrow's night, Now trembling on his darkened sight. He prayed, too, that no blood-stained grave Might wait that watching Warrior brave, Whose spirit frank and free and kind Had calmed and cheered his boding mind. XVIII. Still Jerome leaned on Alban's tower, And thoughtful watched the solemn hour; All things lay wrapt in fearful gloom; Time passed in silence toward the tomb. Nor watch-dog's bark, nor charger's neigh, Nor pass-word went the distant way; Nor swept a breeze upon a bough Of the high leafy walks below. The holy hymn had sunk in peace; Now Nature's breathings almost cease. In the deep pause alone might come The sullen, faltering pant of drum; So faint th' uncertain sound in air, It seemed like pulse within the ear. XIX. He viewed the dawn steal o'er the wold, Paling each beacon-fire afar, Till, wan and dim as twilight star, The warning tale no more it told. On the green woods that dewy light Shed sleepy hues all chill and white. That cold fresh light, that tender green, Dawning through all the lonely scene, A sweet and quiet sadness wore To palmer, journeying at such hour Through the wild path of forest-bower, Well suiting with his humbled mind, In holy grief to Heaven resigned. If it recalled the long-past thought, It soothed to smile the woe it brought: Like touch of some fine harmony To one endued with sympathy. XX. With pious thought and tranced eye, St. Alban's Monk, from turret high, Beheld in silent order rise Tint after tint on th' eastern skies: First, cold rays edged the night's black shroud; Then rose, then amber, changed the hue; Then slowly purpled the soft cloud, That stretched along the upper blue; Where, hanging o'er its shadowy throne, The star of Morning watched alone; But soon more gorgeous tints appear, And tell the mighty Sun is near; Till he looked joyous o'er yon brow, While slumbering War lay stretched below, Whose shrine shall dying thousands stain, Ere that gay Sun look up again! XXI. War's grisly visage there was seen, Engarlanded with May's fair buds; His couch—her meads of springing green, His canopy—her fresh-leaved woods! Her fragrant airs around him breathe, Her music soothes his dream beneath. But soon May's blooms their snows shall yield, By hostile struggle lowly laid; And soon her young and lightsome shade Shall hide the blood-stained casque and shield, Now thrown in wilder'd flight away: And many a tortured wretch that day, 'Scaped from the battle's mortal strife, To scenes of Nature's peace shall hie; And, while all round is breathing life, Sink on some flowery bank and die! XXII. The Monk might, at this hour of dawn, Have traced each army faintly drawn, Through dewy veil, on hills around; And viewed St. Alban's glimmering bound All rich with blooming orchard ground, Where crowded roofs and turrets lay Obscurely on the brightening grey. How dark and still the Martyr's tower Stood on the reddening dawn on high; How solemn was the look it wore, The peace of age and sanctity! Till each dark line stood sharp and clear, On gold and crimson streaks of air. Flowing upon the early breeze, The Royal banner Warwick sees Wave homage to the rising beams! And, while that banner lightly streams, With scornful eyes he viewed the town, “There will I rule ere sun go down!” XXIII. The Knight and Monk, who watched on high, Beheld these rising beams with joy; And lost, with joy, the beacon's flame, For now relief of Warder came. Scarce would the warrior pause to tell, That all near Alban's wall was well; Or change a word of what had been From his high station heard, or seen. And, with the chilling hour oppressed, Jerome, too, sought some welcome rest, And left, exchanged, a monk behind, To shiver in the breezy wind. END OF THE SECOND CANTO. CANTO III. THE DAY OF THE FIRST BATTLE. I. The day had risen; the song of Prime Swelled soft, as ceased the second chime; When now was heard a distant drum Through the wood-lands high to come; And, fierce though faint, one trumpet-blast Hurrying upon the light wind passed. It was not fancy—'twas not fear, That caused those glittering helms appear, And triple-glance of marshalled spear, Upon the high wood's shadowy side; 'Tis there the barbed coursers ride; And, mid the light-leaved shadows go The battle-axe and lance and bow; And banners bright and pennons fair Bicker upon the fretful air. Now, down St. Stephen's woody steep, The warlike bands due order keep, Winding in glimpses to his eye Who watched from under hood, on high, And sadly lost all doubt, in fear; While now the 'larum-bell he rung, And now o'er battlement he hung, Viewing the lengthened train draw near; “Ten thousand,—less there could not be; Ten thousand of the enemy;” And thousands yet he might not see! II. His glad companion smiling heard The panic marvels of his word; But all in vain he promised good, Though, as they flashed from Julian's wood, The knight well knew those armed bands, And brandished high his gauntlet-hands, And shouted welcomes on the gale, “Live—live King Henry—Henry hail!” And waved his banner on the wall, Urging the loud, rejoicing call, “Live—live King Henry—Henry hail!” Till his parched lips and utterance fail. III. And then was heard the various pace Of young and old, in toilsome race Up galleried wall and winding flight, Aiming to reach this topmost height. But soon th' embattled roofs below Proclaim, that few may gain this brow; For, resting there in sable row, Many a brother breathless stood With pointing hand and falling hood, Gazing upon the vision dread Of warlike force, that hither sped. IV. Now, loud King Henry's clarions sound, The many-trampling hoofs rebound, As, issuing from St. Stephen's shade Upon the near and sunny glade, Blazoned shields and helmets gleam, While light the red-rose banners stream; And knights on barbed coursers bear Their monarch's standard through the air. And gentle Henry might you know, Though harnessed close from top to toe. Before him, herald-trumpets sound, Proud chiefs and nobles press the ground; And, where his ordered thousands throng, Winding the woods and vale along, Each bannered knight, as he drew nigh, Was seen to lead his vassal-band, With statelier march and aspect high, Expressive of supreme command, Though courting kindly gesture from his Sovereign's hand. V. Loud and more loud the trumpets call, As they draw nigh St. Alban's wall; And other trumpets answer clear, And “Live King Henry!” rends the air From every guarded barrier. Straight, at the sound, in street below, The thronging shield and helmet go, While busy knights their men array, To line their Monarch's onward way, The van-guard, that, on yesternight, Watched here, upon St. Alban's height. Above, each roof and lattice showed A fearful and a curious crowd, Though forced within their homes to stay, Hoping for glorious wonders, on that day. VI. And now adown the street appear, With better banners, high on air, The Martyr's sons in wondering fear, With chaunted anthems, grave and sweet, Pacing their Sovereign lord to meet. The Abbot is not now arrayed, As he was wont, to meet his lord; His brow no jewelled pomp displayed, Nor from his shoulders now floats broad The scarlet cope, nor robe of gold, Nor the rich velvet's shadowy fold. But he, enwrapt in woeful weed, Suiting his habit to the time, In sorrowing penance seems to plead Forgiveness for some hidden crime, That threatened to draw judgment down Even on St. Alban's shrine and town. But pages hold his mourning train, As when arrayed in robe more vain, And all his officers of state In order due around him wait; While, marching on the crowded way, His Abbey-knights their band display. VII. Far down the steep of Holywell, The chaunted anthem rose and fell. Soon as was heard the solemn song, And seen the dark advancing throng; That busy street, then closely pressed, With bow and pike and demi-lance, Where charger reared, where waved high crest, Was hushed, at once, as if in trance; The crowd fell back, in order grave, Ere Abbot's guard the signal gave, And, as the Abbey-Choir went by, In reverend row you there might see Each warrior on his bended knee, With upward and beseeching eye. And thus, through files of lance and spear, The pious fathers, without fear, On to the southern barrier move Safe in due reverence and love. VIII. And now within the barrier wall St. Alban's sons await their King. And hark! what nearer clarions ring! What shouts around each turret call “King Henry live!—King Henry live! Every Saint a blessing give; King Henry live!—King Henry live! Abbot and Prior blessings give.” Then burst the loud, acclaiming voice From battlements and towers aloof, From cottage-thatch and lordly roof, Of all, who in due rule rejoice. IX. Then, first from forth the barrier-arch Deep and dark, in solemn march, The Herald-trumpets come; Their blazoned coats and pageantry And banners beam upon the eye, Like sudden blaze of witchery From depth of midnight gloom. Behind, a pale and gleaming band, As if by glance of moonlight shown, Stalked, in silence, hand by hand, With threatening crest and visor's frown; The stately forms of men unknown, In cold dead steel anatomized, As in Death's very image 'guised. X. Following this heavy march were seen, On the armed charger's stately sheen, Many a Baron's youthful son, By lofty Somerset led on. With stately step his courser trod; His casque the British lion strode; The triple plume was nodding by; Through the barred visor might you spy The warrior's dark and fiery eye, Though not the mien his visage bore. Proud was his air, his stature high. Above his ringed mail he wore Coat-armour, blazoned bright with sign Of princely birth and Henry's line, And 'broidered with devices fair; Portcullis-bars in gold were there. Two Squires, beside his stirrups, bear His shield and axe and new-shod spear. There marched in stately grace before, With trumpets that high summons gave, His Poursuivant, Portcullis grave, And Henchmen next, some demi-score. Fearless, he sought the battle-hour; Here he beheld not castle-tower, And well he knew the prophecy, That under Castle he must die. XI. Behind, as far as eye might go, Paced barbed steeds and banners slow, Till Henry's standard stooped below The barrier-arch, and borne along By royal Banner Knights a throng; So heavy was the ample fold, That hardly could the knights unfold The crimson silk and blazoned gold. Again came Heralds, four abreast, With blazoned arms and yellow vest, Sounding their silver trumpets sweet, While silver drums before them beat. Followed a gorgeous stately train, Who scarcely might their coursers rein, Esquires and Yeomen, two and two, Accoutred at all points, most true; Knights of the Body, brave and gay, Who ushered Henry on his way, While 'compassing, on all sides, came Chiefs and Nobles, high in fame. XII. Thronged lofty spears and shields around, Where the King's charger trod the ground, And, deep behind the barrier-arch, Plume behind plume, in solemn march, And eyes that seemed to frown with fate, Upon their monarch's progress wait. “Then gentle Henry might you know, Though harnessed close from head to toe;” For, though arrayed for warrior-deed, He sat not cheerly on his steed; Though England's lion on his brow Claimed homage of a Nation's bow. XIII. Soon as St. Alban's sons he spied He drew his rein, and “Halt!” was cried; And when the reverend father kneeled, He pressed his iron beaver down, And would not let his visor frown, But all his countenance revealed, And stretched his gracious hand to raise The aged man with gentle praise. And when the blessed anthems pealed, He would himself have stept to ground, And with the Abbot, side by side, Have yielded up all kingly pride, To pace the Martyr's tomb around. But fiery Tudor near him rode, And instant close beside him strode, And whisper'd somewhat to his ear; Which Henry, faltering, seem'd to hear, And slow and silently obey. Yet, though his stately seat he kept, He bade the father lead the way; And patient, as they stept, he stept, Listening to their slow chaunted lay, With due respect and bended head, While toward the Abbey-gate they led. XIV. On as that martial pageant drew, The Knight on watch would point to view, Each banner and each chief he knew. “There rides the high Northumberland, Leading his hardy northern band, The son of Hotspur, whose bold hand So oft the prize of victory won. There pass the Cliffords, sire and son; And more of truly noble fire Ne'er glowed than in the hoary sire! There Stafford goes; there Buckingham; And fiery Tudor, still the same. Sir John de Grooby you may see, With new-worn honours vain and brave; Just knighted by King Henry he, O may he 'scape an early grave! Whate'er his fate, he cares not now; The plume exults upon his brow.” XV. Now Clement flies right speedily, And, mounting on a turret-way, Through narrow loop begins to spy, The varying struggle of that day; For, figured underneath his eye, While fearless he of spear and dart, Lay street and road, as on a chart. Close looked this Saxon turret down Upon the four ways of the town, And on Queen Ellen's shrine and green, (The garden-plat alone between) And, broad and straight, the way then spread To old St. Peter's towered head; Closing the far perspective there, His battlements were drawn on air. XVI. Below, the roads, and streets, and green, So crowded were with shield and pike, That scarcely was there room between For lance to poise, or sword to strike; But the chief turmoil of the scene Was on St. Peter's spacious way, Where, in the centre of the green, King Henry and his knights were seen, Around his banner floating gay. 'Twas planted for the battle-hour, With the full pomp of warlike power; 'Mid clarion's and trumpet's sound, And shouts, that rent the air far round, Making old Alban's shrines to shake, And tremble deep her crystal lake. On Peter's street that standard stood, Summoning hill and vale and wood. While the King's orders went, to keep The wards and barriers of the place With strong watch; for, near Alban's steep, York now advanced, in quickened pace.— XVII. Advanced so fast, that, when the King One moment at the shrine would spend, His chiefs arranged themselves in ring Around, and urged him to suspend His pious purpose, till that day Were ended, and that battle-fray. Meek Henry yielded with a sigh, And something like a frown Came darkening o'er his tearful eye; But soon, with patient look on high, It died in smile of piety, Such as blest saint might own. Then, turned he to the humble door Of Edmund Westby, th' Hundredor; There his head-quarters were prepared By those, who with him more than shared His power; there he resolved to wait Whate'er might be the battle's fate, Or welcome peace, or lengthened hate. XVIII. In terror from the turret-arch, Was now seen Richard's rapid march, And signal given and 'larum call, Rang round about the Abbey wall. Now all are up on gallery-tower, To scan the enemy's dread power O'er the wide fields advancing round From meadow-slopes, where woods had been, But now no sign of oak is seen; Archers and pikemen step the ground; And down the glade, that spreads below, Arrayed in many a gleaming row, They stand beneath St. Alban's brow. But chiefly on the eastern side Key's Field displayed their bannered pride. There most St. Alban's feared their blow; St. Alban's—ill prepared for war, Though thronged with arms and warriors bold; For no broad bulwark seen afar, Nor stretching rampart, proudly told Defiance and a mighty hold; But simple wall and barrier-gate Warded for old St. Alban's fate. XIX. Wide o'er the northern fields afar Still marched Duke Richard's lines of war, Whose white-rose banners, gathering nigh, Gave silent signal to the eye Of more than he had dared to claim— Richard of York's yet secret aim. White blossoms in each cap were seen, For unblown rose, the sweet may-thorn, From banks of freshly-blushing green By gauntlet-fingers rudely torn, And placed on high, a smiling crest, O'er brows by iron vizor pressed; Device, at once, for the pale rose, And for the name that gave him sway, Who gaily on his warrior-brows Bore the bright bloom Plant-a-genèt. XX. The warders scanned the outspread force From tower and turret still in vain; Richard of York, in double course, To shrouding woods extends his train: And who may guess what numbers there In silence wait and watchful care, Ready the battle to sustain? To inexperienced eyes, and fear, His hundreds, thousands thus appear, Now lost and seen in grove and field; While Henry's thousands cooped in street, Seem but to threaten self-defeat, Incapable their strength to wield. XXI. Morning on day had far advanced, And not a spear in onset glanced; But lingering messages were sent To Lancaster by York, the while, Who, trusting less in arms than guile, By aid of gold was still intent Some captains of his foe to gain; His numbers might, he judged, be vain, Though the great Warwick ruled their course, To grapple Henry's loyal force. XXII. Unawed by sense of treachery, Richard now dared, irreverently, To call on Alban, as his saint, To hear him vouch his true intent— “In verie knowledge of his trothe To witness to his loyal oath, To honour Henry as his king, Should he to instant justice bring Those false suggesters of his will, Who wrought his kingdom only ill.” Yet Henry's oath he would not take, That speedy justice should awake; But, on the moment, made his claim That every noble he might name Should to his camp in fetters come, And there receive their final doom: This done, he would disperse his men. And bow to Henry's power again. But well he guessed such claim would wring Only defiance from the King. XXIII. And this was Lancaster's reply, That rather than to him betray His faithful servants, he, this day, Would for their sakes, fight—live or die! And, though long pressed by “great disease” And heaviness of heart, He swore by sainted Edward's peace, He would not thence depart Till every traitor of that hour, Who should persist in strife, If placed by battle in his power, Should forfeit there his life. This while the virtuous Henry said, A tear of anxious grief he shed. XXIV. The morn was gone, noon nearly come, Yet was not heard the 'larum-drum; Still Richard held a double course, And Henry still restrained his force. Now, while full many a fearful eye From Alban's tower looked eagerly, And none knew what delayed the blow, They marked again, in street below, A white-rose Herald blindfold led, Where high the bannered rose of red Waved duteous o'er the monarch's brow. King Henry, ever duly slow To draw the desolating sword, Piteous and mindful of the woe, That might ensue from slighted word, Greeted the wily parl once more, And long the message pondered o'er; For show of hope and peace it bore. XXV. And now a guileful sound of peace Swells faint to those, who watch on high, Bidding their care and terror cease. But wherefore, to their straining eye, Yon shifting glance of helm and lance? And why those sudden trumpet-sounds, Mingled with tremour of the drum, Gathering in loud and louder rounds, Like burst of gaunt and ravenous hounds? 'Twas those without St. Alban's wall, Raising the treacherous onset-call, While yet for peace their Herald treats And “Peace!” is shouted through the streets. And now St. Alban's monks descry A shower of arrows falling nigh To Key's Field, o'er that barrier-lane, Where the besiegers strive in vain To burst into the guarded town; While doubling and redoubling come The trumpet's shriek and roll of drum, And shouts that rage and havock own. XXVI. In street below raged to and fro, In wild disorder, men-at-arms; And heralds sounding loud alarms; And knights, close braced from head to toe, Uncertain where to meet the foe; Whom, though they heard, they might not see For houses and for orchard-tree, Till signal from St. Alban's tower Pointed where pressed the threatening power. Then Somerset, with brief command, In order ranged each 'wildered band. The noblest and the bravest stood By the East barrier, near the wood, That led to Sopewell's Priory, Where watched, in sad consistory, That fair and trembling sisterhood; For thence the loudest turmoil came. But noble chiefs and knights of fame Crowded St. Peter's high broad way, Where their liege-lord, King Henry, lay. XXVII. And soon from other quarters blew Clarion and trump without the walls; But even on tower they had scant view Of those whose 'larum thus appals. Those sounds called every foot to climb To battlement and tower sublime. Then not a brother stayed below, Whom age did not forbid to go; Or who around the shrine kept ward; Or some sad priest, at Chantry-tomb, Saying long Obits in the gloom, Pale with expectance of his doom; While, listening to dread sounds abroad, His station in the aisle denied To view the course of battle-tide: And oft the blast in turret nigh Mocked his impatience with it's sigh, As if some whispering friend drew near To share with him his half-told fear. XXVIII. Fiercer and fiercer rose the bray, Till, every shrine (save Alban's) left, The chantry of it's priest bereft, The silent dead forsaken lay. Even he, who, worn with last night's watch, Would fain some little slumber snatch, Now startled by the trumpet's breath, Calling as with the voice of death, Uprose and sought the turret grey, That eastward o'er the Chancel lay. The strength of battle pressed that way. This little watch-nook hung in air O'er the great window of the Shrine, Forming a canopy most fair For the carved cell and image fine, That knelt with upward aspect there— St. Clement, in his fretted cove, The namesake of the Monk above. This 'battled summit seemed his crown, Who had for ages knelt thereon, Seeming to feel with those below, Whose choral voices, murmuring slow Round those sad mansions of the dead, Would strive a saintly peace to shed. XXIX. While Clement thus his fears obeyed, And sought this barbican so high— This raven's nest so near the sky— More awful rose the battle cry; Steel clashed, and trump and clarion brayed. It seemed as though the deafening sound Rose straight below on Abbey-ground; But distant was the place of war, Beyond the Eastern barrier, And partial seen, by glimpse aloof, O'er many a high and crowded roof; For thwart the Abbey stretched the way Of Holywell, and screened the fray. Yet was Duke Richard's farther host In spreading shock of battle traced, By the near, unseen, impulse tossed, Like circles from a centre chaced. XXX. And o'er this swaying of the storm, Incessant hissed the viewless form Of arrows, shadowing the air, Or lightning glance of hurled spear; While keen, below, the restless rays Of shield and casque and corslet blaze; And Key's Field broad displayed the course Of Richard's and of Warwick's force. Neville of Salisbury fought near, Unseen, close at the barrier; But firm-set pike and arrowy shower Failed to make passage for his power; For aged Clifford stemmed his way, And scattering, as he went, dismay, Fired young and aged, knight and lord, And every hand that held a sword. XXXI. But whence the shouts so thrilling now? Why do the townsmen, on each roof, Rise earnestly, even on the toe, And rashly hurry to and fro, As if on level ground they go, And mount the chimney-tops aloof, And bend far o'er the depth below? Those ridgy roofs and chimneys tall, Crowded with heads, like leaves on tree, From Clement's anxious gaze hid all He climbed this lofty perch to see. But soon the arrows fell so near, The gazers shrunk below with fear, And left each summit-station clear; He then, in safe and shrouded nook, Upon the place of war could look. XXXII. There yet a narrow Green is shown, That eastward runs behind the town— The place where Richard pitched his tent; Small part of the broad space, that went By name of Key's Field; close it bent To Sopewell lane. The barrier nigh Did long the enemy defy. The princely Somerset fought here; And, had his spirit e'er known fear, That fear it would not now have owned, For here no fateful castle frowned; And well he knew the prophecy, “That under castle he must die.” While the stress lay round that barrier, (Clifford within and York without) So often swerved th' assailing rout, That Richard's overthrow seemed near; But who 'gainst secret aid is sure? What force 'gainst treachery may endure? XXXIII. O'er beds of peaceful flowers he came, The Knight who flew to Richard's need, With helm and shield on barbed steed; Onward he pressed, at utmost speed, Glared on his lance the red war-flame, Knights and spearmen fast succeed. On full six hundred helms appeared His badge in gold or silver wrought— A rampant bear, with staff uprear'd, And this the boastful tale it told— “He wins whom I uphold!” Fierce was the trumpet's blast—the war-cry burst; “A Warwick! a Warwick! Warwick is here!” In Holywell road he was the first Where valiant De Clifford kept barrier. Though grey his locks in his cap of steel, Yet a hero's fire glowed in his eye; His spirit glowed for his country's weal; “In Henry's cause may I live or die!” XXXIV. “My Lord De Clifford, Warwick's foe! Warwick calls on you now to show, Why meet'st thou not the RAGGED STAFF? The Bear would fain thy life-blood quaff. Hast thou forgot thy daring taunt, That thou through life my steps would'st haunt? My Lord De Clifford! here am I, Avouch thy boast, or it deny!” Soon as his voice De Clifford heard, No halt made he for taunting word, But cheered the knights of his command, And rushed to meet him hand to hand. Strong as Disdain his well-nerved arm, Loyal his heart, all true and warm, He sprang to meet his mighty foe; “Who vainly boasts let this day show!” Where was his son at this dread hour, When Rage and Hatred o'er him lour? He fights not in his father's band; Afar he holds some high command. But numbers round De Clifford fought, Who Danger's vanmost heroes sought; Whom zeal and reverence and pride Held close embattled at his side. XXXV. When Clement from his post looked down Close on this quarter of the town, And viewed the fateful turmoil there, Scarce could his mounting spirit bear To loiter here, secure and free, While cries for doubtful victory Pierced to the very vault of air; But monks below, on battlement, Who watched how the fierce contest went, Of these, scarce one but blessed the day When he to Abbey took his way, And bound himself to shun all battle-fray. XXXVI. Hark! Warwick hath burst the barrier, And in the surge of combat there, Which rolled not on, but to and fro, Alternate swayed for friend and foe, Each individual form was lost, So mingled was that mighty host. No eye might now De Clifford trace, Nor eager Warwick's lofty grace; Yet knew where each the conflict held By fall of horse and crash of shield. And oh! what mingled sounds arose Above the trumpet's fiercest call! The yell of havock—shrieking woes Of matrons, from the latticed wall, Watching unseen in houses nigh, Who view a son, or husband fall, And under trampling charger lie, In deep, expiring agony! XXXVII. Now arrows thickening in the air, With hiss incessant, shrill, and near, Warned from each open battlement The crowding monks that o'er it bent. But Clement, in his turret-cell, From evil hap was sheltered well; Yet wounded was his sight by flow Of human blood in streams below. Not so the raven's o'er his head, As mute he watched the slaughtered; Unseen companion! stern and sly, Waiting his banquet of the dead, Impatient while the dying die! XXXVIII. And now, behold the barrier-guard Pressed back into the rising street; Where houses hide their slow retreat From Clement's view, though hitherward The rage of war came nearer still; For, on this steeply-mounting hill The Abbey stood, part screened below By wall and gate and orchard-bough. And, while afar bold Warwick's force Beyond the barrier he could watch, Yet might our Clement sparely catch Glimpse of the nearer battle's course. At times o'er wall, or waving branch, Appeared high plume on helmed brow, Or iron hand upraised to launch The battle axe, or sabre blow; The threatened blow he well might see, But not it's fateful certainty; A falling horseman he might spy, Or a freed charger passing by, Or warrior bleeding on the ground, Even just without the Abbey's round. XXXIX. The battle's strength still slowly pressed Up Holywell, on Warwick's side, When Clement from his secret nest Heard 'larums new and shoutings, wide; And looking northward, whence their course, He marked a troop of Henry's horse Led on by Percy's self, at speed: They came at Clifford's utmost need, With fierce and threatening cries afar, And checked awhile the tide of war. 'Twas Percy of Northumberland, Rode vanmost of the gallant band: And Buckingham and Stafford's earl Led where the crimson flags unfurl; And many a knight and baron bold, In battle and in honours old, And many a youth, who but that morn Had first his knightly emblems worn. XL. To Clement it was dreadful sight, This press of noble chief and knight; For now more deadly raged the fight. And here the place of war outspread, Showed him their armour streaming red, And almost every wound, that bled. And down the charger's panting side He marked the gushing slaughter-tide! In vain the shaffrone guards his face, Or neck the mailed mainfaire shields, Or breast-plate fills it's ample space; Such garniture poor shelter yields. XLI. King Henry's bravest warriors move, Great Warwick's hardiness to prove, While, closely urged by foeman's spear, The wounded coursers plunge and rear, With outspread nostrils raised in air, And fiery eyes, that shoot despair; They trample back the crowd behind, Who, upward on the steep hill forced, Press other troops in street confined; Then chargers fall, and men unhorsed O'er their own dead and dying go, Nor horror, nor even pity know, Conscious of nought but hate and strife, Reckless of quickly-ebbing life, Fighting on foot 'gainst horse and lance, Meeting in vain their foe's advance; Till, on the heaped and nameless dead, They reach their final gory bed. XLII. Now other trumpets, blown with might, North, East, and West, spoke triple fight; But loudest strains swelled from the way Where their liege-lord, King Henry, lay. There York himself the barrier burst, And on St. Peter's Green was first. And now, on summit of the town, Where stood Queen Ellen's shrine alone, King Henry's troops make their firm stand; As if each man thought his sole hand Fought on that spot for the whole land. And from that summit of the town, On the four main-ways looking down, At every bar, save one, they see The archers of the enemy; And crowding helms, and ill-spurred horse, Trampling o'er the new-fallen corse, And forcing back each barrier-guard, Mount where that Shrine had long kept solemn ward. XLIII. That Shrine, where Silence wont to dwell, And listen to the breathing spell Of midnight hymn; or the lone psalm Of monk thus wooing the soul's calm; Or the long sweep of winter's wind, Like sigh of disembodied mind; Or winter wind, or summer shower Falling on leaves of Abbey-bower:— That shrine of Edward's lasting love, Where reverend steps alone might move, Which every eye with tears survey'd, While every head it's homage paid, Where tenderest thoughts still hovered round, And gentle visions blessed the ground, Wearing Queen Ellen's mien and smile again, Who sucked the venom from her husband's vein. XLIV. Upon the steep of Holywell, The strife of death had ceased to swell; 'Twas filled with slayer and with slain, And there alone did Warwick reign: Yet slowly mount his conquering train; For hardly may they make their way, So heaped the bleeding bodies lay. Even the war-horse, when near the dead, Trembles before the life-stream red; Bristles his horror-lifted mane; His tossing nostrils speak his pain. Still, with distorted side-long leer, He views the object of his fear; At last his shuddering feet uprear, At last the spur assails in vain. The warrior on his back feels less, Though better might that warrior know The signs of suffering and woe, And his own doubtful fortune guess. But poor ambition, thoughtless pride, Bear him, scarce moved, through battle's tide. XLV. Then Clement left his raven-nest, And to a Saxon turret pressed That o'er the northern transept rose, Where all around Queen Ellen's bier He wide might view, and all might hear, Even till the battle's close. As he approached that turret-stair, Lone were the Shrines and Chantries near; No shadowed form on Offa's aisle Stole o'er the drear length of the pile, But all so hushed the scene beneath, It seemed the hall and throne of Death. XLVI. Clement had gained the turret-floor, And pressed the massy oaken door: Surprised he found himself among The Abbot and a younger throng Of monks, whose sight could pierce afar, And tell the varying tide of war. From their full window he withdrew, And to the sister-turret hied, That looked on the same northern view, Commanding o'er it far and wide: Here—though a crowd of hooded heads Darkened the double Saxon arch, Fled from high tower and open leads,— Here might he watch the battle's march. XLVII. From blessed Peter's tower on high To Ellen's shrine of sanctity, No thwarting roof-tops then concealed The broad way of that fateful field. The long green vista stretched below, Straight as an arrow from a bow. There, close around that ancient tower, Incessant fell the arrowy shower; O'er graves and charnel vaults it flew, It cleared the streets in Clement's view. Duke Richard's self, commanding there, Had forced the northern barrier; Waged war o'er the long-buried dead And blood upon their homes had shed. And many a youthful warrior brave, In his first armour dressed, Fought even upon his very grave, His morrow's final rest. XLVIII. From that dark tower the long broad way Was thronged with Henry's bands, Close pressing where their monarch lay, And where his banner, floating gay, Richard's full force withstands. Clement could not De Clifford see, Nor Somerset's high blazonry; But Buckingham's pale plume he knew, And his white armour's silvery hue; And, while he gazed, he saw him bow, Then rise and totter in his seat, And rein his charger to retreat. A shaft has pierced his iron brow; He sinks to earth; the dark streams flow. XLIX. Stafford, his noble son, fought near, But saw not when his father fell; And soon the battle's onward swell Checked, though not turned, his own career. For, vain the terrors of his spear, A fatal dart his gauntlet caught; 'Twas pain, not danger, as he thought, And, heedless of that pain, he fought Till, fainting with the bleeding wound, He falls on henchmen pressing round, Who bear him senseless from the ground. L. But, yonder, on St. Peter's way, With long sweep and resistless sway, The surge of battle rolls along, And threatens even the household throng, Who watch their King, this fateful day. And now, behold his banner there Bow low and totter in the air; And now, from forth his guarded hall, St. Alban's lofty Seneschal, And Henry's self, appear. Yet feebly did the King advance, As bending to some dire mischance, His vizor close, his sword in hand, And guarded by a noble band And crowds of demi-lance. LI. He mounted on his battle-horse, But turned him from the battle's course, Or would have turned; the warrior steed Showed daring high for other deed. Long did his stubborn neck disdain To bend him from the trumpet's strain, With prancing foot and curvet high, With spurning heel and arching mane, He baffled still the guiding rein. He would have borne his lord away, And plunged him in the thickest fray, But that a friend, though loth to yield, With strong arm bore him from the field. LII. Yet hardly through the gory street, So thick the dead and dying lay, Could the guard find a safe retreat For Henry, or pass on their way. Then Lancaster's sad heart sunk low, Ill could he brook such sight of woe; Shuddering he turned aside his head, While his steed stepped among the dead; But still to his averted eyes Other grim shapes of horror rise, And “Peace, O! blessed Peace,” he cried; While knights, who warded at his side, Could scarce restrain their rising pride. And, when their lord secure might lie, Swore round his Rose to live, or die. LIII. And had our sovereign lady, Dame Margaret, the Queen, been here, Her cheek had crimsoned o'er with shame To view her husband's fear; Though sorrow and disease oppressed The princely spirit in his breast. Not thus she fled, when second war Dyed Alban's field with blood, But, high on Victory's iron car, Rushed through the purple flood. But pity tempered not her ire; No tear-drop dewed her eye of fire; No hallowed fear her conscience held, Nor piety her proud heart quelled; These virtues, that ambition thwart, Drew not upon her course the rein; Brought not the pause—the second thought, That passion's impulse may restrain: Rapid and fierce she pressed her way, Though Truth and Mercy bleeding lay. So, Gloucester, thy red grave might tell, When mourned for thee St. Alban's knell. LIV. Danger, when braved, like coward flies, And safety, sought, oft wayward hies; And this King Henry's heart was taught, Even while he humble shelter sought. For, ere he reached a cottage-wall, An arrow-wound had made him fall, But that his band close round him throng, And bear him on his steed along; And, wounded, bleeding, fainting, slow, A thatched roof shrouds a Monarch's woe. LV. Return we now to Ellen's shrine, Where, thronging through the four street-ways, Ensigns and plumes still wave and shine, And falchions flash and helmets blaze, And flights of arrows dim the air, Rattling like hail, On shield and mail, In chorus with the war-shouts there. And still, where blessed Peter's tower O'erlooked Plantagenet's chief power, Still, in Sir Philip Wentworth's care, Proudly the Royal Banner stood. But now, while onward swept the flood, That standard trembled in the air, And foremost fled the traitor-knight, Sworn to maintain that banner's right. He fled, without a single wound, He fled, and cast it on the ground! Then, scarce opposed, York's special guard Made dreadful havock down the street; And, though below their way was barred, 'Twas there their whole force thronged to meet. VI. Long did the noblest of the land Round Ellen's mournful bier withstand The triple-guided force Of Warwick, York, and Salisbury; Oh! it was dreadful truth to see The battle press it's course Up every way to that high place, Where, crushed into a narrow space, The band of heroes fought For him, who meekly wore the crown From sire and grandsire given down, By his own will unsought. It was a gallant, mournful sight To see those warriors few Die for the cause which they thought right, —Allegiance they thought due. LVII. And now the rumour faintly spread, That Henry wounded was, and fled; Nay, lay in humble cottage dead. Then first his faithful knights knew dread. But, transient was such sense of woe, And, “Vengeance! Victory!” they cried; “His son shall triumph, though he died.” Richard of York, the while, had sought Where the King wounded lay, And soon to his low roof was brought, And claimed the prize of that fierce day. Henry, though captive, then might see His conqueror on bending knee, With feigned suit and bold pretence, Protesting truth and reverence. In wily words, with poor deceit, York said he never meant him ill; That he had only armed to meet Those foes, whose dark, ambitious will Had ruled his councils and the realm, And shortly would his throne o'erwhelm. But now, those enemies o'erthrown, If Henry would their acts disown, And rule the English land alone, His true liege-subject he would prove, And henceforth only seek his love. LVIII. And thus swore all York's subtle band; But, adding still a new demand, They claimed to guard the King from foes, Lest evil council should dispose His virtuous will to vengeful deed, And, by retaliation, lead To future discontents and woe. Now, this urged Richard's subtle train; And further “safety to maintain,” They asked he on the morn would go To London, in their duteous care, And choose with them a council fair. LIX. And thus, with humble look and word, The Duke his loftier hope deferred. Though Victory was on his side, He secretly might own, Time had not brought on the spring-tide Might bear him to the throne. To win this venturous battle-day, Such arts had now been tried As could not claim continued sway, Nor long his fortune guide. But, for the moment gratified, He left to future hour his claim, That surer he might work his aim; And therefore did he lowly bow, Though victor, to his captive now. LX. Soon did fair speech King Henry gain, While his heart, filled with grief For others' jeopardy and pain, In words now sought relief. “Spare, spare my people's blood,” he said, “This moment bid the slaughter rest, My will shall then by your's be led; My pardon take for all the past. Lead me within the Abbey walls; This scene of blood my heart appals!” LXI. Straight, Warwick bade the carnage cease, And bleeding strife was hushed in peace. That fateful moment who may paint! Meet instant for the joy of saint! The sword upraised withheld the blow, That might have laid a brother low. Then, sire and son, in armour clasped, While almost cach the other grasped, And strove against the other's life, Heard the low strain, that stills the strife. They pause; the steeled mask they raise; They gaze; they shudder, and they praise! The song of Peace is on the air, Her snowy signal floating there! One moment stopped the woe prepared, And death, remorse, and horror spared. Oh! may that saintly moment be Enshrined in high eternity; And there to blessed Henry give Such joy of Peace as he bade live! END OF THE THIRD CANTO. CANTO IV. THE HOUR AFTER THE BATTLE. I. Now to St. Alban's shrine was led The captive King with royal guard; While Richard at his side kept ward, And Men-at-arms, with stately tread, Encompassing about him went, Beneath the Abbey's battlement. But, who King Henry's woes may tell, As he passed on the blood-stained way, Where half his gallant nobles fell, And yet untouched, uncovered lay, Scarce cold, upon the gory heap, Fixed in their last, unbreathing sleep!— The friends, who on this very morn, Since when but few brief hours had sped, Had high sway in his council borne; Who bent with him the thoughtful head! Whose living eye by his was read!— Now, ever closed their earthly dream; All vanished, like a phantom's gleam; The veil withdrawn—the vision fled! II. The Abbot at the Abbey-gate The victor and the vanquished met; And thence, with bands in formal march, And monks arranged in order long, Led to the farthest eastern arch, With mourning chant from the full throng; Where Henry, on St. Alban's tomb, Sought to disperse his mental gloom. III. Such Vision still is seen to mourn, When evening-twilight falls, By him, who on that day's return Stands silent by these walls— The vanquished Sire, the victor Chief, The mitred Abbot pale in years, Whose cheek seems furrowed o'er by grief, And sanctified by Pity's tears, The pious fathers, side by side, And the whole Convent's choral pride; Three times beneath the Chancel's gloom, They move around St. Alban's tomb, Through open arches that appear, As once they wont above the bier, But, when the dream has passed away, Close, and are seen as at this day. IV. It is a strange and fearful sight— The Vision of that dreary night! —To watch those shadows crowding by, Each moving in his ordered place, Like living form, with deathly face, Distinct, and busy to the eye, With gesture true of solemn rite; Yet not a whisper heard, the while, Of step, or voice, upon the aisle; —It is a strange and fearful sight! V. But other scene, on that midnight, Has shook the sexton with affright, While passing o'er the glimmering nave, By the dim flame his lanthorn gave. Sudden, on each low tomb around, A bleeding bier has seemed to rest, Where stern in death a warrior frowned, With funeral watch-light o'er his crest. Where'er the old man turned his view, Has seemed such face of livid hue. But feeble age has fancies strange! Youth may, on that same midnight, range Through choir and aisle, and nothing see, Save Norman arch and gallery, And the brass-bounden grave of him, Who sang the warrior's dying hymn. But, leave we now such idle dream, To mind the past, yet real theme. VI. Low at St. Alban's tomb they knelt, The Conqueror and his King, The Monarch hushed the pang he felt; Nor did the victor sing Memorial for the battle won, But, decent, mourned the slaughter done. Then solemn, from the Choir below, The hymn of Vespers rose, And, while meek Henry's tears fast flow, Breathed balm upon his woes; But, transient was the sad repose:— It ended with the Vespers' close! VII. Just where the King did lowly bend, Lay Gloucester in his grave! His truest counsellor and friend, Whom yet he failed to save From Margaret's hate and Beaufort's guile,— All unsuspicious he, the while, Of the fell hatred that they bare His kinsman—and their murderous snare, And of his own progressive fate. Had good Duke Humphrey ruled the state, His truth had been his Sovereign's shield Gainst treason, open, or concealed. Good Gloucester slept within this space, And Henry, sufferer in his place, Stood o'er his grave, in sanctuary From his own rebel soldiery! Oh! who may dare unfold The darkening thoughts that o'er his spirit rolled, And from his memory threatened soon to sweep All paler records of long years, that weep, While, thus a captive, with his foe he bent Silent o'er bleeding Gloucester's monument. VIII. When service in the Choir was o'er, The Monarch and his train Passed onward to the cloister-door, Led by the Abbot, as before, With the full chaunted strain, To rest in royal chambers nigh, The honoured Abbot's guarded guest, Beneath the velvet-canopy, Whose couch he oft in peace had pressed. How different is his present state From that he once had known, When Westminster proclaimed his fate Was France and England's throne; When, passing from the tapers' glare, Just cumbered with his crown of care, With infant smile he laughed to see Such crowds and blaze of pageantry! IX. Ah! had he dimly then perceived The secret of the gift received, Stained with the blood of former times, And thickly set with deadly crimes, Gleaming with woes and passions dire From 'mid Ambition's smouldering fire, How had he shrunk, and wished to lie “In shades of quiet privacy!” And, ere he wore it for his own, Renounced at once his father's crown. Now, all it's terrors blazed, confest, And peace for ever left his breast. Yet might he not his path retread, And give from his anointed head The diadem his fathers gave, Which fixed him for a party's slave. X. Hard was the heart, and stern the mind, And to it's own contentment blind, That could unloose a kingdom's woes, Within that painful crown confined, While firm it circled Henry's brows; That could a selfish, slumbering right Rouse from it's lair in Time's dim night; Cry “Havock!” and pursue the prey But for Ambition's holiday! Hard was the heart, and dark the mind! Such his, who Henry's path beside Marched where the convent-train inclined, Beneath the Transept's vaulted pride. XI. And thus was ranged the stately march, When the King passed the Transept-arch:— On his right-hand the Abbot walked, Mitred and in his cope of gold, The pious monarch's gift of old; And on his left Duke Richard stalked. Straight from the place of war came he, Nor moment spared his casque to free; Aloft the white plume proudly rose, But soiled with crimson were it's snows, And Henry paid a bitter tear For every gore-drop speaking there. Beneath, the lion-passant crest His royal lineage professed; And vizor up might darkly show The meaning of his anxious brow; While Richard's form and stately grace, His stature high, and martial pace, Decisive look, and eye of fire, Steady, though keen, and quick and dire, Gave contrast to King Henry's air, Who, wan from wound, from grief and care, Moved with unequal step and slow, With wearied countenance of woe, And weeping, with uplifted eye Of meekness and of piety. XII. The reverend father, by his side, Though pale and bowed with care and age, Still showed an aspect dignified, A look of mildly-tempered pride, Such as doth love and awe engage. As some tall arch, in fretted state, Left lonely 'mid the wrecks of fate, Though perished be each gorgeous stain That coloured high the storied pane; Though broken be the moulded line, That flowed with grandeur of design; Though shades of many a hoary year With lights of silver grey are there; Th' awakened mind yet more supplies Than Time has stolen from our eyes; And o'er the ruin's desert space, That arch throws high and shadowy grace, Wraps us in pleasures almost holy Of reverence, love and melancholy. XIII. Through the great cloister passed the train, Where the carved trefoil windows glowed With many a rich illumined pane, By living Whetehampstede bestowed. Large was the verdant plain within, High the arched walks encompassing. Now darkened was that long-stretched way With Alban's hundred monks; though gay In scarlet copes went Chancellor, The noble Steward, Seneschal, And officers in the rich pall They wore on solemn festival; In snowy state, each Chorister, Chaunting before the mournful King, Till he had reached that guarded door, Where, tall and light, the arches soar That lift the Chapter's vaulted ring. XIV. Then part the King and priestly band, Who, in long line, on either hand Bend lowly, as he moves along, Smiling upon the cowled throng, To the last murmur of their song. Still marched Duke Richard at his side, And still the Abbot was his guide. A different train received the guest, Soon as he moved from his short rest: Soldiers, with helm and pike arrayed, Lined the long walk of cloister-shade, That lay between the abbey aisle And royal lodge, a stately pile. A royal homage still they paid In the meek hymn the trumpets played. How felt the King, when close he viewed Hands drenched with his good people's blood, And looks that said they held in ward, And still would hold, their sovereign lord! XV. In the King's Parlour waited now Poor banquet, served in saddest mood, Where pages round their monarch bow, And captive knights indignant stood, To view their injured King bestow His speech upon his subtle foe, Who wrought this day of blood and woe. With starting tear of gratitude And pity, good King Henry viewed His faithful servants near him stand, And here attend—a prisoner-band. Not Richard's truth, nor courtesy, Had placed them here, but policy. And Henry, though not thus deceived, Such art instead of truth received. Fill not for him the wassail-bowl, Strike not the minstrel-string; These may not o'er his saddened soul Their brief delirium fling: For he has passed among the dead, And Truth's great lesson there has read, As from each face the mask she drew, And showed what phantoms we pursue! While to his wandering troubled eye, Life's strifeful progress seemed one sigh! XVI. But short repose the banquet gave, Ere Warwick and Earl Salisbury crave Audience of him they still call King; And many a wily guest they bring. Straight from the field they came in haste, Informed on all points to the last. Now to the Council-room repaired, With harassed mind, their wounded Lord, To sign his pardons, and reward The traitors, who his life yet spared. The Abbot to his chamber drew (His heart to Henry ever true) To gain a quiet pause, though sad,— Perchance an unseen tear to shed, And lift his thoughts where oft they fled. XVII. Then order to the Steward went, That hospitable cheer Should to the Abbey gates be sent Of bread and meat and beer; And to each soldier, friend or foe, Dole from buttery-hatch should go; But other store of food was small; For thousands thronged in Alban's wall, And every townsman's board was spread For victor, or for conquered. Now, at each postern and low gate, The Monks dispense to all, that wait, What fare they may: but, who can show The groups that, gathering below, Now stood beneath the reverend tower, Emblems of battle's bleeding hour? Wan were their features, fierce, though faint From toil and hunger and dismay, Just 'scaped with life the deadly fray; Their o'erstrained muscles quivered still; Their eager eyes, suspecting ill, Were watchful yet of all around, Even on this consecrated ground. The broken armour's crimson sheen Showed what the owner's lot had been; There grimly did the cap of steel Dint of strong battle-axe reveal, Or cuirass, bearing sign of spear, Proved Death had threatened entrance here. All were so changed with dust and gore, Their nearest friends had passed them o'er; And their strange, rude and broken tone, Not wife, nor courted lass had known. XVIII. While thus beneath St. Alban's shade, Panting, these bands of Havock stayed, Round crowded porch and postern nigh, Some outstretched on the graves are laid, On lower wall some rest the head, They ne'er again may hold on high. And some within the sacred aisle Lean on an altar-tomb the while, And, flinging down the bleeding sword, Instead of offering humbled word, Greet with an oath the watch-monk there, Whose low-breathed hymn and pious care, With kindest awe and gratitude, In all but basest hearts ill passion had subdued. XIX. Some, too, there were, whose evil eye Scowled on the Monks, as they supply, With kindness meek, due sustenance, Sweet'ning the bounty they dispense. “Well may they give of ample store, Wrung from the land and famished poor, To bribe us to forbearance now From plunder of their shrines, I trow! Methinks our swords have something won From lazy Monks, who live i' th' sun And roll in riches of the land; While others, by hard toil of hand, May scantly live from day to day. Yet, listening to their cunning saye, Henry and Richard bid us ‘Nay.’ Let such folks in a convent stay; But, by St. Alban's crown of gold, I would not—I—for them withhold From treasures now within our reach, Though Kings command and Abbots preach.” Then, rousing from his sullen mood, Such soldier snatched his comrade's food; And so displayed to humblest sense The motive of his fair pretence. END OF THE FOURTH CANTO. CANTO V. THE EVENING AFTER THE BATTLE. SCENE—WITHOUT THE WALLS OF ST. ALBAN'S. I. In angry gloom the sun went down Upon St. Alban's bleeding town, While sadly many a Red-rose knight, Escaping from the ruthless fight, Traversed the woods and wild hills round; And ever sought he tangled ground, Pathless and dim and far away From peasant-foe, who might convey Notice to Richard's scouts and bands, Prowling for prey o'er Alban's lands. II. Oft would the lonely Warrior start At glance of arms, shot through the shade, Where bright the western sun-beam played, Judging some foeman watched apart; And strange it was, 'mid brake and bush, Where only might he guess to see Sweet violets sleeping to the hush Of southern breeze, 'neath oaken tree,— Strange there to spy a warrior's casque, Or cuirass gleam, or steely mask; An eyeless horror, stern and still, Amid the peace of leaf and rill. It was but harness, thrown aside, Whose cumbrous weight had stayed the flight Of some sad comrade of the fight, In the late scene of evil-tide. These armour-signs, if spelt aright, Might tell whose footsteps he might trace Along the rude and desert place. III. Oft would he pause on woody hill, Listening if all were lone and still. And oh! how still it seemed and lone To one escaped from battle-bray, From raging and from dying moan To Nature's grand and peaceful sway! How calm her breathings, pure and clear, Among the linden foliage here! How fresh and gay it's blossomed spray; How sweet and good her smiles appear! Sublime her ordered laws and true Moved o'er the landscape's evening-hue, And solemn in the thunder spoke, That, far off, on the hill-tops broke. Sublime her stormy lights and shade, Which all the stretching view pervade. Her storms no moral evil show, To work—like human tempest—woe; But health and goodness from them flow, Quickly and sure as tears of Spring The Summer's fruit and beauty bring. IV. The Red-rose Knight, who from the hill Yet watched where wood and vale were still, Had 'scaped, though wounded, from the strife, And hardly 'scaped with limb and life. He fought, until King Henry's host, By treachery foul, not weakness, lost, Were pressed, at all points, on the town, Deceived, betrayed, and trampled down. This loyal Knight of Lancaster, Though not in Alban's prison bound, Was not yet free from anxious fear For friends, who fought upon that ground; And yet he lingered on the hill With parting look, and listened still, As if his eye, or ear, might glean Tidings of that now distant scene. V. He heard, perchance, faint trumpet-strain Marshal for watch some knightly train; Or neigh of charger, high and shrill, And sounds perplexed and dubious thrill; Or 'larum-drum and shout afar, The dying tremour of the war; Or, deep and full, St. Alban's bell Roll on the breeze the warrior's knell. And he would gaze, with sad farewell, Where yet the gliding splendour falls, Along those ancient towers and walls. VI. Throned in the vale and pomp of wood, The Norman Abbey darkly stood, And frowned upon that place of blood, Beneath the lowering western cloud; Till the sun, from stormy shroud, Looked out, in fierce, yet sullen ire, And touched the towering pile with fire. Below, each battled turret seemed The Martyr's crown of flame to wear; While, through the airy arches there, The sun's red splendour streamed. But transept-roofs and aisles between Lay stretched in darker tint and mien, As if they mourned the slaughtered dead, Laid out in blood, beneath their shade. Slowly the vision changed it's hue, In sullen mists the sun withdrew, A ball of lurid fire, from view. Yet curving lines of burnished gold, (Traced where light clouds their edges fold) Through the red haze, his station told. Then Evening fell o'er all the vale, Faded each tower and turret pale; Till, shapeless, huge, obscure as doom, The Abbey stood in steadfast gloom; Vast, indistinct, and lone, Like Being from a world unknown! VII. While the worn Warrior gazed his last, The death-bell spoke upon the blast. And now, while he beheld afar— Himself secure—that place of war, And heard again that deep death-bell Along the evening breezes swell, Each moment waked a tenderer fear, Each toll made one dear friend more dear. He marvelled how he could have fled, Uncertain of their fate; And back resolved his steps to tread, And seek to know their state. Then, through the gloom he bent his way, Led by the Abbey's solemn lay. High music on the soul it played Of thoughts beyond this earth's low shade. VIII. Though on St. Alban's tower and town The shadows of the tempest frown, In softened shade, along the vale, Peace seemed to dwell in twilight pale. O'er the long, fading forest line, Village and hamlet, hid beneath, Sent up on high their silent sign Of evening cheer, the thin grey wreath; Village and hamlet, that by day Veiled in the sleeping shadows lay, Or, in blue distance, gave faint show Of roofs and social scenes below. Ah! treacherous to their own repose! Such wreath betrays to watchful foes, Scowering the hills and heath-land nigh, Where dear, though humble, treasures lie, And the bright-blazing hearth may share, Though not the crimes, the woes, of war. To other eyes such blaze might speak Of succour, that they vainly seek, For bleeding wound, for ebbing life, For fainting nature's last, last strife. Vain hope, it fades upon his sight; The Warrior's eyes are dim in night! No arm his sinking head may prop, No light hand dry the chilly drop; The damps of death are on his brow, Oh! for some aid—some comfort now! That now is passed, he breathes no more; Unseen—unheard—his pangs are o'er! IX. Where were his friends when he sunk low? Knew they no strange presaging woe? Felt they no instinct of that hour, No touch of sympathy's deep power, Run o'er the shuddering nerves, and wake Tones from the heart, that anguish spake? Like to that lyre's prophetic call, Self-sounding from the lonely wall, Whose only utterance was a sigh, To hint when death, or woe, was nigh. Ah, no! they talked, or laughed, or sang, Unconscious of his dying pang. No eye wept o'er his lowly bier, The dew of heaven his only tear; And sighs of eve alone were here, Rustling the light leaves o'er his head, As if they mourned the Warrior dead; Making his stillness seem more still; More sad the shade of grove and hill. X. Here shall he rest till distant day, In the deep forest's untrod way, Coffined in steely arms alone; And, for carved sepulchre of stone, And foliaged vault of choral-aisle, The living oak, with darker smile, Shall arch it's broad leaves o'er his form, Poor shroud and guard from sun and storm! The woodlark shall his requiem sing, Perched high upon his branchy tomb; And every morn, though morn of Spring, Shall o'er him spread a mournful gloom; And every eve, at twilight pale, His chantry-bird shall sweetly wail; And glow-worms, with their watch-torch clear, Wait mutely round his grassy bier, Keeping aloof from his dark rest Reptiles, that haunt the hour, unblest; Till other Morn her cold tear shed, And 'balm anew the soldier dead. XI. There was, who, from her distant bower, Watched all that day St. Alban's tower, As if its visage could have shown The dreadful tale it looked upon, And told to her the doubted fate Of him, on whom her fears await, Who joined King Henry, on that morn. Oh! shall he to his shades return, And through the oak's broad foliage view, Once more, the vale and mountains blue? May then their peaceful branches wave High welcomes o'er his knightly plume, Or, shedding deep their saddening gloom, Murmur low dirges o'er his grave? XII. Pale with anxiety and fear, She in her silent bower must wait, Her playful infants came not there; Her spirits ill their songs could bear While doubtful of their father's fate. At times came messenger from far, With various rumours of the war, “His lord had late been seen in fight!” So told the fleetest of the flight. Another had beheld him fall, When Warwick burst the barrier wall, A third, report of fell wound brought; A fourth, that vainly he was sought. Slight rumours all—yet each some dread of ill In heart of lovely Florence did instill. XIII. In oriel and in alley green By turns she sat, or walked, unseen. Th' unfolding buds of Spring were there, Breathing delight upon the air. Health, life, and joy, by song of birds As well are told, as if by words. Those opening buds, that breath of joy, That song of birds did but annoy Attention, that for faintest sound Listened from Alban's fearful ground. Oft on the calm there seemed to float Murmur confused—a trumpet's note,— Dull beatings of a charger's hoof— The sharper clash of arms aloof— Tumultuous shout—the onset cry— Signal of some, that meet and die.— Whose summons heard she in that call? Oh! at that moment who might fall! XIV. Attention each fine sound pursued, Till doubt and distance seemed subdued; She listened then, as if her ear Could bring each phantom of her fear In real shape before her sight. There glowed the terrors of the fight! She saw her loved lord wounded sink, And slowly from the battle shrink, With not a hand his arm to stay, Or help him, where he bleeding lay. Farther she dared not—could not, think. XV. Aghast and motionless, in trance, While such terrific visions glance, She rose up from her pale despair, His fate to soften, or to share. And she, who from a summer shower Would fly to covert of a bower; Whom thunder tortured with alarm, Though sheltered in his faithful arm; Who lived in privacy's safe round, And joys in cares domestic found (The cherub-smile of infancy, The look of love, still watching by); Whose heart would to best music move— The music breathed by breath of love, The music of Affection's eye— That varied world of harmony! Even she renounced all feeble fear, Pressed by a danger more severe; And felt the spirit of the brave, When her mind caught the hope to save. XVI. Till near the falling of the sun, It was not known the fight was done; And then, that lady's messenger, With face, that spoke before his tongue, Of horrors, that round Alban throng, Brought heavy news of Lancaster; But tiding of her lord came none! A dreadful silence wrapt his name— The pause, ere falls the lightning's flame, Might be just image of the same. Without a tear, without a sigh, She read dismay in every eye. Unbreathing calmness o'er her face Now veiled, with melancholy grace, Her courage,—moral courage,—love, That soon their truth and strength must prove. XVII. One ancient servant, faithful found, She chose to guide her on her way, And search with her the blood-stained ground, Where dead and wounded still might lay. In vain that humble steward sought To win her from such daring thought, And told the dangers that await Wide round St. Alban's bleeding gate; And she, who ne'er had viewed the face Of slaughtered man, how might she trace, How bear to look upon the field, Where their last breath the vanquished yield! How search for face of her dear lord, Or, finding, live and aid afford! XVIII. Florence a forceful sigh suppressed, “Haste! not a moment may we rest. Such aid even now he needs; away! He bleeds—he dies, while we delay!”— “How, lady, may you reach the town, On public road, unseen, unknown; And seen and known, how, prison-free, Escape the grasp of enemy? A shorter path perchance might lead O'er open ground of heath or mead; But that was viewed by every eye: While through the forest's closer way, The dim paths far and widely stray. How reach the guarded barrier? And, lady, how might you endure The weary path; or how procure The pass of posted warrior!”— “My purse such posted guard shall gain, My palfrey bear me, while he may; My purpose will my steps sustain; Away—to horse! away, away!” XIX. By sense of duty thus upheld, By strong affection thus impelled, Florence must quit her sheltered home, O'er desolated tracks to roam. In chamber, gallery, orieled-hall, Her home was deadly stillness all; But stillness without peace—more drear Such stillness, than the War's career! It seemed, as through the hall she passed, Murmured a mourning trumpet-blast. She turned, as sad it died away, And, while the slanting western ray Played through a casement's ivy wreath, And touched the armoured shape beneath, That stood, like guardian of the hall, By stair, where fearful shadows fall, She thought the corslet heaved, as life Was there beneath, with death at strife. Perhaps, 'tis glance of ivy-leaves Trembling in light her eye deceives. XX. Short pause she made within the court; Her steed received her as in sport, When fresh from cheer of green-wood shade; Though now no soft caress she laid Upon his glossy neck, or face, Nor gave him word of gentle grace. Yet did he know her, though the 'guise Might wrap her from a stranger's eyes; And pawed the ground, in mantling joy, And arched his crest, and turned his eye, And champed the bit, with nostril wide, And laid his playful head aside, As asking welcomes from her hand, And suing for it's light command. XXI. Old Leonard led through forest-way, And pointed where St. Alban's lay, With look of grave and anxious thought. The sun those lofty turrets brought Full on the eye, that, at their sight, Sickened and darkened, as in night. Yes, though she felt the western blaze, Strange gloom, all cheerless, met her gaze. She saw the sun—she knew his beam, Yet seemed in dimness of a dream! With mingled grief and terror filled, Her spirits scarce their task fulfilled; Yet did her will it's purpose hold, As might the boldest of the bold. Right onward, as the path might go, She pressed, to meet the coming woe. The fanning air her frame sustained, And firmly still her steed she reined. Though on the Abbey-tower her eye Was fixed—that tower would seem to fly; For, though at utmost speed she went, More distant seemed it's battlement; And, though she knew her palfrey moved, That he went forward was not proved. XXII. Though true and good the long-loved steed, His weary limbs relaxed their speed. He marvelled at the pace she hied, And would resent the whip she plied, (Unused to feel the goading pain, And fretting with a high disdain,) Had other hand but held the rein. Often would Leonard now implore That, till the forest-shades were o'er, His lady, for his master's sake, Some caution for herself would take, Nor tempt St. Alban's dangerous wall, Ere deepest gloom of evening fall. The sun was yet upon the towers, And lighted yet her roofs and bowers. XXIII. Florence once turned her weary sight, And, in the landscape's beamy light, Viewed the peaked roofs and glittering vane, Where slept, in peace, her infant-train. A sigh—the first she long had known— Burst from her breast, and fell a tear; But 'twas not grief she felt, nor fear: 'Twas desolation, hopeless, drear! She seemed in this vast world alone; 'Reft of her joy, her guide, her might, Even life itself was desert night. XXIV. St. Alban's, onward as they drew, Spoke fearful symptoms of the war; Tumultuous murmurs, cries afar, Wild roar, that distance did subdue; And oft, from path unseen, was heard Horse-tramp, or shout, or solemn word; And heavy sounds of woe and pain Led to the steps of wounded men, Unhorsed and plundered of their arms, And jealous still of new alarms. These Leonard questioned of the fate Of friends within St. Alban's gate, While Florence, with attention dread, Apart, in silence, bent her head. Little he learned; for scant they knew, 'Wildered in tumult of the fight, Of what had passed beyond their view; But in one tale they all unite— The plundering fury of the foe On those whom they o'ertake in flight, And their relentless, coward blow; All urge the strangers to beware, Nor Alban's fatal barrier dare. XXV. Then ancient Leonard urged anew The dangers would her course pursue; And Florence yielded now her ear, By truth warned, not by idle fear. He led where steed might hardly go Under the stretching, beechen bough, A scene of deep repose and gloom, Hushed as some lonely aisle, or tomb— So hushed, that here the bird of May Amid the leaves began her lay; Not the known lay of joyous morn, But midnight hymn, sad, sweet and lorn; Yet sometimes, as her cadence fell, Strange mournful murmurs seemed to swell— Sounds indistinct and dark, to wail, Or darkly hint, some dreadful tale. XXVI. Sudden, where opening branches yield, Florence beheld the tented field, Beneath St. Alban's walls afar, Spread with the various lines of war. Broad, moving masses she might view, And hurrying bands of gleamy hue Preparing for the coming night; And trains of horse, whose armour bright Flashed radiance to the western light; And trumpet-signals faint were heard And far—halloo and shouted word. All that there lived, seemed strong in strife, But 'twas for comforts, not for life— All that there lived!—alas, that thought! What strife of hope and fear it brought! While o'er the scene St. Alban's tower Looked sternly on the passing hour. XXVII. To this wild scene of war's array,— Where busy atoms of a day, Entrusted with brief rule, had proved By what slight springs their force is moved, Opposed—great Nature tranquil lay. Though on the hills, far to the West, Dark thunder-shadows awful rest, There power and grandeur seem combined With stillness, as of brooding mind. The purple gloom lay deep and wide, Save where the umbered splendours glide Broadly and silent o'er the vale, And touch with life the forests pale. XXVIII. While Florence watched, beneath the shade, The camp in Key's-Field now arrayed, She shrunk, as danger seemed more near, Yet found impatience conquering fear; And, urging on a rapid flight, Ere hindered by advancing night, She looked, perchance, upon the way, Where now her dying husband lay! Urged by such thought, she paused no more; And, as the Abbey's guardian roof Might shield him, should the last be o'er, There would she seek her first dread proof. XXIX. She turned her steed, and gave the rein, But checked awhile his course again, As from by-way and near she heard A slow wheel pressing the green-sward. It bore, beneath the veiling shade, Some wounded chieftain lowly laid. In dread attention Florence sees, As the light steals through parted trees, The mute train turn the jutting bank, (Where the high beech, of silver rind, Caught the slant sunbeam ere it sank,) And through the deepening forest wind. The level radiance, shooting far Within the shadows, touched that car; And, glancing o'er a steely crest, Flushed the wan visage in it pressed. Too distant fell the slanting light To bring the features forth to sight; But played on falchions drawn around, Guarding their chief o'er dangerous ground; And gleamed upon the silver badge, Of lofty servitude the pledge. XXX. Florence restrained the impulse strong, That would have forced her to that throng, And Leonard hastened to explore Some signal of the Chief they bore, While she, within the deepest gloom, Watched, as for sentence of her doom. She marked, when he o'ertook the chief, No gesture of surprise, or grief. Soon, where the broader foliage shed It's gloom o'er woodbanks high and steep, Beyond the warriors' way there creep A sandaled group with hooded head, Silently from the umbrage deep. This pilgrim-band might scarce be known, Clad in their amice grey, From tint of boughs with moss o'ergrown; But that some clasp, or chainlet shone, And ruddy tinge their faces own Of the full Western ray. XXXI. As from the pass that shadowy train Sought Alban's sheltering aisles to gain, Unknowing that the war's sad course Had thither brought Duke Richard's force, Sudden, the wounded Chief they meet, And, doubting, wondering, pitying, greet. Leonard, while he drew near, o'erheard The meeting Pilgrim's hailing word, And question, on the spreading war, And who was borne upon the car? There lay Earl Stafford, wounded sore, Whom Buckingham must long deplore: Then prompt good wishes they exchange, State of the roads and pass declare, Give news of war, and counsel fair How best the Pilgrims may arrange Their distant way, through secret path, To gain, ere night, some quiet hearth. XXXII. Leonard asked tidings of his lord From all who, round that bleeding car, Halted with watchful eye and guard. And various rumours of the war They told, of chiefs slain, saved, or fled; Clifford and Henry too were dead: Brief and unsure was all they said. Baron Fitzharding? He was slain— Some told, and some denied again. Leonard, on mention of his death, With eager look and trembling breath, Straight to the Chief himself addressed His question; who, howe'er distressed, Upraised with patient courtesy His languid head, for brief reply:— “'Twas said, that, early in the strife, Fitzharding fell, yielding his life To Richard's sword; but then such tale Should not as certainty prevail; For those engaged in ardent fight Know not who falls beyond their sight.” XXXIII. Ere yet the hasty talk had passed, Swelled on the calm a clarion's blast; Then sudden and near shout thrilled high, And pain and terror's mingled cry. The Earl gave signal to proceed; And wishes warm the conference close For life and health and safe repose. The car then moved with feeble speed. Fixed in dismay the Pilgrims stood, Till Leonard, pointing through the wood, Told where a little dim path wound, Remote from Alban's fatal ground. Then bent he with the fearful tale To Florence. How may he prevail To lead her home? How soothe her woes, When his dire news he shall disclose? XXXIV. While she had watched his steps with doubt, She heard the faint pursuing shout, And marked where trailed the distant rout. But, even here, where all seemed lone, The dreariness was not her own; At times came nearer voice, and yell Of wandering bands, or bugle's swell In signal-call, or laughter loud, Horrid to her, as voice from shroud! Others there were who shunned the road, Anxious to reach some safe abode, Ere yet the brooding tempest fell; For so the gestures seemed to tell Of men, who, on the wild heath turned, And pointing where the red gloom burned, A moment paused, as if to say “How dark the storm comes on our way!” XXXV. Sudden, while Silence slept around, Her courser listened, as if sound Disturbed his watchful ear; With feet outstretched and rising mane, Averted head and eyes, that strain, He gazed, in stiffening fear; Then reared, and, with a restive bound, He bore her from that fearful ground, Ere she had aught perceived for dread, Or sound had heard, that terror spread. Vainly she tried to rein her steed; So docile late, he keeps his speed, Though now they meet a haggard group, Who, with fierce gesture and wild whoop, Would check his rapid flight; Trying, when near, to snatch the rein; To chase, when passed; but still in vain; He bears her from their might. XXXVI. Pencil alone may trace such woe As darkened faithful Leonard's brow, When he had reached the oak's lone gloom Where Florence dared to meet her doom, And found her not! But, while around He searched the close embowered ground, A form terrific fixed his eyes. Sheltered within the thickest shade, There lay a pale and dying head: In blood an armoured warrior lies! It was his lowly, faltering groan! His casque, where a stray light had shone, And might give glimpse of ghastly face, Betrayed him to the startled steed; Who bore his mistress off at speed, Ere she his cause of fear could trace. XXXVII. Ere Leonard, 'neath the darksome bough, Might the dead form, or feature, know, A fearful sound and shrill and high Upon the rushing breeze went nigh. A shriek it seemed—again he hears The voice, that summoned all his fears. Once more he listened, but the breeze Rolled lonely o'er the bended trees, And died, but, as it swelled again, Brought on it's tide that note of pain! Leonard, ere yet the plaint might close, Turned his good steed the way it rose. END OF THE FIFTH CANTO. CANTO VI. THE EVENING AFTER THE BATTLE. SCENE—WITHIN THE TOWN AND ABBEY OF ST. ALBAN'S. I. Though now, within St. Alban's wall, Was hushed the turmoil of the day, The crash of arms, the Chieftain's call, The onset shout, the clarion's bray, The stillness there was scarce less dread Of those, who, looking on the dead, In voice suppressed and trembling spake, As if they feared the very sound, Or, that it might disturb, or wake The victims stretched around. Yet, sometimes, 'mid this calm of fear, Rose sudden cries of woe most drear For friend or kinsman found. But, though the slain filled all the ground, No brother yet dared brother move, Or close his eyes with pious love; And, though amid that ghastly band Lay chiefs and nobles of the land, Yet might no man his pity prove; Nor herald take his fearful course, To know and name the new-made corpse. II. Earl Warwick ruled that woeful hour. What were compassion 'gainst his power? How many, fallen upon that heap, Warm and alive, but succourless, Had there unnoticed found the sleep His will might never more distress! While he disputed, planned, arranged Ambition's little dream of fame, Or with his peers, or knights, exchanged Some narrow points of rival claim. And thus it went till even-tide; And then the mitred fathers' cry, That those who had, on each side, died, Should rest with equal honours here, Was coldly granted; while a tear Of saddest pity filled his eye, Who pleaded for such ministry. The monks, too, asked an armed band Might round their Abbey portals stand, And yet another guard their way, When they their pious dues should pay, And step amid th' unhallowed troop, Who o'er the dead and dying stoop. III. Then went the heralds on their round, Proclaiming forth the dead; And, following on that blood-stained ground, York's plundering lancemen sped. And then, sustained by courage high, Pale brothers of the monastery, Solemn and still and sad went by; Nor shrunk they, with an useless fear, To do their awful office here. IV. Then straight were borne to Alban's aisle, Rescued by guard from wanton spoil, Dead chief and prince and noble knight, High plumed, and harnessed for the fight, To rest, all in their steely gear, In consecrated chapel there; Knights, who that very morning rode Beneath the Abbey's tower, And hardly owned the earth they trod, Or any earthly power. So light in hope, so high in pride, Pranced they to battle, side by side: Now under Death's dim flag enrolled, Their transient story now all told; Still, comrades, side by side, they go, And side by side, though shrined in brass, Must soon into oblivion pass; Scarce word shall live, nor sign, to show What spirit's dust sleeps there below. V. 'Twas well Duke Richard granted guard; Much need had they of warlike ward— Those hooded monks and lay; Since armour rich of men they bear The conquerors might strive to tear From the dead corpse away. And hardly did the guardian sword, Or written sign of Richard's word, Deter from bloody fray. And scarce the palls the Abbot sent To shade the noble slain, While through the open street they went, Could hide bright casque, or chain. Oft would a sullen murmur run From lancemen rude the porch beside, That the rich armour they had won Should be preserved for chieftain's pride; That they, who braved so much of toil, Should share not in the hard-earned spoil. They laughed in scorn, when it was said, Such spoil would in the grave be laid, Fit shrouding for a warrior dead. Forty and nine of dead alone Then bear they through the gate; And many wounded men unknown, Their pious care and pity own, Too oft in dying state. VI. How mournful was the scene and dread Of monks around those warriors dead, Laid out in aisle and nave, When, through the western window's height, The red sun, ere he sunk in night, His last sad farewell gave! His beams a darkened glory threw, Tinged with that gorgeous window's hue, On every vault and arch on high; Glanced on each secret gallery, And half unveiled it's mystery; While shrine and bier and form of woe Lay sunk in shadows deep below. Grand as the closing battle-hour, Yet gloomy as it's fateful power, Hovered that light above the slain, Last light of their last day, and vain. VII. 'Twas at this hour of twilight pale, When curfew-bell gave heavy wail, A Pilgrim to the Abbey came Brief rest and timely aid to claim. While seated in Refectory Thus did he to the warders state, That, trusting to no bravery, But to his honoured weed, his fate, He passed alone the tented line Of Richard's camp, his outer guard, And the town barrier's watch and ward. Now, when the Abbey-band asked sign, And answer due to their watch-word, He ne'er before their pass had heard. Then other means he tried to gain The warders, and tried not in vain; His gift bestowed, he pressed his way, Where dim the convent portal lay. VIII. Lofty and dark that porch arose, By fits the vaulting shown, When the tossed torch a red flash throws O'er thick-ribbed arch and crowning rose, And hooded face of carved stone, While passed the dead and dying through. There watched the Pilgrim, hid from view, Within a turret's dusky stair, Whence he might note what corpse they bear; He watched, with fixed and tearless eye, The warrior's death-march crowding by. IX. Under the gloom of portal door, On bier and shield while soldiers bore The hopeless wounded and the dead, Pale monks with lifted torches led, And Abbey-knights in silence ward; Following came lancemen, as rear-guard. The dying forms, then passing by, Showed every shade of misery, Mingling with warlike pageantry. Some lay in quilted brigandine, Others in polished armour shine, And some in surcoat blazoned high. Some were in 'bossed and damasked steel, With threatening crest and plumed head; These the closed helmet-bars conceal. On others the raised vizor shed A shade athwart the eyes more dread Even than the wounds it might expose. And some there were, whose shroud-like mail, Binding the chin and forehead pale, Would all the dying look disclose! O! that poor look, that sinking eye, When glanced a light from torch on high, Held by some mute o'erbending monk, Of ghastly air and visage shrunk; Whose wanness, though of different hue From his, that lay beneath his view, Yet, seen beside the living tint Of men, who bore the corpse away, Seemed but a fleeting shadowy hint Of one, who had lived yesterday, As with still step he passed along The wounded and the dying throng. X. Once, as the grave's dark guests pass by, The Pilgrim's sad and bursting sigh Betrayed him in that shaded nook; And, as the sound fell on the ear Of monk, attendant on the bier, He raised his torch around to look. It showed him but the portal-roof, The studded gates, long battle-proof, The low-browed door and turret-stair, And not the dark weed resting there. And, had he spied that pilgrim-weed, The form beneath he might not read, Nor guess the world there hid, the fears, The trembling thought, that sees and hears, In every shape, in every sound, Image, or hint of grief profound; The pang, that seeks the worst to know, Yet shrinks, and shuns the meeting woe, Affection's pang, o'er-watching care, And, sickness of the heart! despair. Yes; it was Florence there who stood, Watching each passing corpse, And waiting till a firmer mood Might bear her on her course. XI. And, when the mingled crowd was passed Of living and of dead, And the great portal, closed so fast, Echoed no sound of dread, On noiseless foot pale Florence paced The Abbey-court—and cloister traced And hall and chamber's gloom, Forsaken gallery, dim stair, Remote from steps of ceaseless care, Fast thronging round the tomb. No voice through stillness stole, no sound Through all the widely vacant round. Door after door, in long display, Still led where distant chambers lay, Shown by fixed lamp, or taper's ray. XII. By such ray, trembling on the gloom, She passed through many a vaulted room; In one she paused, flung back her hood, And, with an eager frenzy, viewed What, silent, in the centre stood. The board, that feasted living guest, Behold! was now the dead man's rest! For banquet-cloth—a winding sheet! That, lifted by the face and feet, Veiled, yet made known, some form of death, Laid out, unwatched, unwept, beneath! Honour had watched his living course, Terror and Pity wound his corpse, But Sorrow bends not by his bier! Though now, perchance, her steps are near. XIII. A shuddering instinct yet withheld Florence from seeking, who was veiled; And even the dread uncertainty Whose countenance she here might see— Even this seemed momentary shield From truth, that might be there revealed. With eyes fixed on that winding shroud, Powerless she stood beside the dead; Came o'er her sight a misty cloud; Through all her frame a tremour spread; A stillness of the heart—a trance Held her, like statue in advance; One hand just raised to lift the veil, But checked, as life itself must fail, If one loved face should there lie pale. A moment passed—she raised the shroud, Fell o'er her sight a darker cloud! No cry she uttered; dropped no tear; But sunk beside the Warrior's bier. There by a lay-monk was she found, When passing on his wonted round; There, like a broken lily, laid Half-hid, within her pilgrim-shade; And thence, with hopeless care, conveyed. XIV. Though closed the Abbey's outer gate, Still, through low porch and postern-door, Pikemen the dead and dying bore To the near aisles, where monks await, And watch around th' expiring chief, With aiding pity, silent grief; And every form of horror view, Yet calm their duteous task pursue. Clement, the Monk, was, on this night, Shrine-watcher on the southern aisle, Pacing o'er brass-bound graves the while, By the pale, sickly, waning light Of yellow tapers, ranged in state O'er tombs of the departed great. Under the transept's shrined shade No victim of the war was laid; Yet, as with slow and heavy tread Passed on the bearers of the dead, Clement a prayer of requiem said. XV. From these new relics of War's rage Turning, it did his pain assuage To look on marble sepulchre, And ponder Latin register Of those, who ruled here in past age. He thought of Frederick the Bold, Laid out in monumental brass, Who, casting off his cope of gold, Armed at all points stood in the pass, When Norman William came of old; And, sprung himself from royal race, (Canute, the Dane, spoke in his vein) Defied the Conqueror to his face. Clement now almost saw his form— That warlike Abbot, rising dim From the grave's sleep, as roused by storm Of battle, then approaching him; And could have thought his armour's gleam Did through the chancel-shadows stream; Nay that his very shape stood there, With face all haggard, wan and spare, And plumage staring o'er his crest, As if wild horror it expressed. XVI. Was this a vision that he viewed, Wrought by o'erwatching of the mind? It seemed along the shade to wind, And rest in thoughtful attitude. All in the aisle was lone and still, But from the distant nave a thrill, A murmur deep and stifled broke; Where monks, as they the dead laid out, In voice of strange lamenting spoke, As if half fearing, half devout. Clement, the way that moaning came, One moment turned his eye; What was it shook his lofty frame? What wrung from him that sigh? He drew upon his face his hood, Deep rapt awhile in thoughtful mood;— When able to lift up his mien, On the choir-step that vision stood, That unknown shade, so dimly seen. So woe-begone and stern it's look, The Monk with sudden terror shook. He signed himself, and passed the way Where other shrine-watch yet might stay. XVII. It waved him back with lofty sign, Then trod the aisle alone, In stately step, to Catherine's shrine, And spoke in stifled tone. But Clement, still o'ercome with dread, Before that warlike image fled. It was no phantom that stood there, But a true knight of Lancaster; Who, 'mid a crowd of monks, that bore A warrior through St. Mary's door, Had here a dreadful refuge ta'en Among the dying and the slain. He craved of Clement secrecy, That he might here in shelter be, Having escaped, at midnight hour, From those, who watched around this tower. XVIII. The Monk, well pleased with fear to part, And aid Lancastrian Knight distressed, Welcomed the stranger to his heart, And freely granted all his quest. He pointed to a little stair Wound upward o'er the transept there; He pointed, but they heard, remote, Dull, measured footsteps fall, And saw through Mary's portal float Slowly, a sable pall. Distant, upon the aisle it turned, Where Gloucester's chantry-tapers burned. The stranger stood, with brow intent Upon that mournful vision bent: So pale and still, though stern, his look, Image he seemed, forsook of life, But that his cresting plumage shook, And told of passion's strife. All reckless of himself he stood, While on the bearers drew, Till Clement roused him from his mood, And led him from their view. XIX. Within a little secret door Of this side aisle, they now explore A stair, that goes within the wall To galleries on high; These run behind close arcades small Along the transept nigh. The arches round, the pillars short, (With capitals uncarved and square,) Changing each single arch to pair, Seem by rude hand of Saxon wrought, Or Norman William's earliest train: So massy is their shape and plain. Hid in these galleries, unknown, A stranger long might be, Yet on the shrines and tombs look down, And all there passing see. Such channels run, in double tier, Through every aisle and transept here; Yet goes not one, unchecked, the round And bendings of this mystic ground, But, broke by window, arch, or pier, The narrow way is often found. XX. Within that little secret door, A few steps of the Choir before, Clement the mournful stranger led, While passed, upon his funeral bed, Unwept, unknown, that warrior dead. The pall had shifted from it's hold, And showed a casque of steel and gold, A lion passant crest; And, just beneath the vizor raised, The eyes, for ever fixed and glazed, A warrior's death confessed. Two men-at-arms stepped slowly near A Poursuivant, before the bier; And, as they passed, the Knight could hear The watch-monk, Clement, feebly say, “Who passes to his grave, I pray.” The herald deigned not word to give, Save “Live King Henry! Henry live!—” The Knight then, in his secret cell, No longer might his feelings quell; But stepped upon the aisle to learn, What friend or comrade he must mourn. XXI. The bier had passed away the while, The herald at it's side, And, as he turned upon the aisle, Where nave and choir divide, The stranger did Portcullis know, And princely Somerset laid low. With bended head and downward eye, He mused in grief to see The Chief so oft of victory, Whom last he viewed 'mid banners high And trumpets' pride and shout of joy. While thus the warrior dwelt in thought, The Monk, respectful of his pain, No word of consolation sought, Impertinent and vain; But watched him, with a low-breathed sigh, And look of gentle sympathy: Till the Knight, fearing further stay, Turned round and signed the Monk away; And Clement led him up the flight, That opened on the gallery height. XXII. The beams, that rose from shrine and tomb, Broke on that stair-flight's distant gloom, As now the Knight and Monk ascend; And, seen beyond low arches there, Tall fretted windows rose in air, And with the transept-shadows blend Dim form of warrior and of saint, Traced gloomily by moonbeam faint. These words the Monk at parting gave, “Sir Knight, whatever you may see Within this hidden gallery, Sir Knight, be watchful, mute, and brave; The way is little known, And you are safe from human ill If you shall secret be and still:— “I leave you not alone!” The Stranger yielded to his will, But answer made he none. Yet much he mused on the dark word, That might some inward hint afford Of those he feared, this night, to see Changed by Death's awful mystery. XXIII. Within the pillared arch, unseen, He stood and looked beneath; Transept and aisle lay deep between This angle and the Nave's long scene Of suffering and death. Obscure in that far distance, lay This scene of mortal misery; And, where tall arches rose, Each arch, discovering the way To what beyond might passing be, Did some dread group disclose. Pale phantoms only seemed to glide Among the torches there, And stoop upon the tomb's low side, In busy, silent care: Unseen the deathly form below, Unseen the pale, reflected woe On miens, that each woe share; The sable cowl appeared alone, Or glimpse of helm, or corslet, shown By the red torch's glare. XXI. Distinct, no sound arose, nor word Along the vaults and arches spread, Save that low murmur, shrill and dread, Which in the Choir the Warrior heard; While still the heavy march, afar, Brought on new victims of the war. Down the long south aisle swept his eye, Upon whose verge two hermits lie; Athwart that aisle, in farthest gloom, The frequent torch was seen to glide, Borne by the heralds of the tomb; And, hurrying to the cloister-side, Lay-monks oft bore upon the bier, Into the dormitory near, Bodies where life might yet abide. And, ever as the Knight beheld Those mournful shadows go, Terror and high impatience swelled, The fate of friends to know. XXV. Then sadly he withdrew his eye From scene of Death's dark pageantry, Shaped out in garb so strange, And bent it on the view below, The southern transept's gorgeous show, In long and ordered range Of chantry, chapel, and of shrine, Where lights for ever were to shine, And priests for ever—ever pray For soul of those, whose mortal clay Within the still, cold marble lay. On high, the broad round arches rose, That prop the central tower, Where, north and south, the long roof goes, That either transept grandly shows In full perspective power. Dimly those arches hung in night, Interminable to the sight. While rose the massy piers to view, The distant torch their shadows threw Broad, dark, and far around. Like Warders o'er this gloomy ground, Those Norman pillars stood and frowned. XXVI. On either side, in transept-wall, Where rise four pointed arches small, Now silent, dark and lone, Four dedicated chapels lay, Receding from the open way, Whence rose due orison. Tapers beamed on each altar there, 'Mid image carved and picture fair. In one the priest sang nightly prayer For Tynemouth's Prior, Delamere, Once ruler of the Abbey here. Not that within this chapel's shade, His coffined bones were ever laid; But in the chancel, graved on brass, His stately form, with mitred head, Still guards his low and silent bed, Where he such happy hours did pass. Calm is the countenance and wise, With lids, that shade the thoughtful eyes. So exquisite the graven plate, So fine the form, so old the state, Oh! may it long be spared the fate Of other sad memorials near, Torn ruthlessly from reverend bier Of abbot, knight, of prince and peer. XXVII. As now the Stranger caught some strain, Memorial of the newly slain, Or heard the tender notes that plead For spirit freed from mortal weed, Pity and grief his eyes oppressed, And tears fell on his warrior breast; Such requiem might his father need! He turned him from the moving strain, And paced the gallery dim again; With quick unequal step he paced, And oft that gallery retraced. Once, as he reached the farther end, Another pathway, low and small, Winding within the eastward wall, Seemed far away to bend. END OF THE SIXTH CANTO. CANTO VII. SCENE IN THE MONASTERY. I. The Warrior stood, and marvelled where The secret way he spied might go, Whether to turret high in air, Or to some penance-cell below; When, as he looked, a beam of light Dawned through the gallery's long night. He passed upon that silent way, And came where many a darting ray Through the broad Saxon mouldings stray Of a deep, jealous door, With massy iron studded o'er. Unclosed it stood, yet nought between Of cell, or winding stair was seen. II. He paused, and anxious bent his head, For a faint wailing seemed to rise, Like that of mourner o'er the dead: He would not mourner's tears surprise. But soon the murmur died remote, Nor any sounds on silence float. It might have come from hearse of death, In chancel-aisle, unseen, beneath. He passed the jealous Saxon door, And stepped upon a covered floor! Within appeared a chamber small, Crowned with a vaulting, rich and tall, With slender central staff for stay, Whence the traced branch of leaf and flower Spread, like a shadowing summer-bower, Where evening's slant beams stray. III. A velvet-curtain, drawn aside, Showed bay-recess, of fretwork pride, Where, on the window's stately brow, Vision of angels strove to glow, As waiting orison below; For there an altar was arrayed, And consecrated tapers shone, That such poor feeble homage paid, As mortals pay by forms alone. Beneath that curtain's sweeping fold Were ancient reliques, set in gold; And, open on the altar, see A missal, gold and velvet bound, And on the step, just pressed by knee, A cushion 'broidered round. The down had not regained it's sheen, Where the low bended knee had been, Yet there no living step was seen. IV. The moon kept her still watch on high, 'Mid surges of a stormy sky; And, on the fretted window's pane, Illumined the rich pencilled stain Of groups, that wake and die, As sweeps the varying shadow by. Now, as those angel-forms appear And vanish in the shaded air, Most strangely seemed each transient face Some guardian spirit of the place. V. A moment stood the Knight to gaze Upon this chapel's circling bound; The blazoned walls showed helpful phrase, And the high scenes of holy ground. O'er an arched door, that caught his view, St. Andrew's shielded sign he knew, Carved on the stone, and, close beside, This Abbey's mitre-crest of pride, Another shield, with wheat-sheaf, near, Spelt of the Abbot ruling here, Wheathampstede of the lengthened days. A moment stood the Knight, to gaze Upon the bending form above, As watchful in its fretted cove, The sainted bishop—Bishop Blaize. VI. Another form, of air serene, Above the Saxon door was seen: Saint Dunstan, he, whose harp all lone Sounded in such celestial tone, As if from airy choir, at eve, Whom mortal eyes may not perceive. With careful pause the Stranger viewed That Saint's enraptured attitude. A crystal lamp, suspended high, Touched with keen light his upward eye; As if a beam of heavenly day Fell, while he watched a seraph's way, And listened, in mute ecstasy The slow ascending strains decay. So fine the passion of his eye, It seemed to speak both tear and sigh; And the fallen drop upon his cheek Spoke more than words themselves may speak. VII. He passed the door with cautious tread; It to a vaulted chamber led, With storied tapestry dressed around; A screen of carved oak was it's bound. In lofty oriel, light and rich, O'ercanopied, like mural niche, King Offa, as the moonbeams glide, Glimmered, in pall of purple pride. Above, the trefoil-traced pane Displayed, in bright and varied stain, Th' allusive arms, or cognizance, Of Abbots, long departed thence. This bay looked on the platform green Of Abbot's cloister, that was seen In streamy light and slanting shade, By the tall transept's turret made. From it's bowed roof a silver light Hung, and a trembling radiance shed O'er the worn brow and hoary head (With snow of seventy winters white) Of a lone form, that sat beneath Pallid and still, as shape of death. The Abbot, in his mitred chair, Wearied with grief and watch, slept there. And, from such deep and kind repose, Such seeming peace of heart as now Beams blessedness around his brow, Oh! must he wake to former woes? VIII. To the armed Knight who near him stood, He seemed a Saint in tranced mood, Or who had breathed his soul away, And left below the pallid clay Impressed with sign of heavenly bliss, Instead of mortal happiness. On the high desk beside him lay The blessed Sriptures, shown by light Of waxen tapers, branching there— The study, that had closed his day, And calmed the terrors of the night With heavenward hope and heart-felt prayer. His crown of earthly honour stood Behind him, and a purple hood Half shrouded, in it's stead, the snow That slept, like moonlight, on his brow: His vest and tunicle of gold, His ample train of graceful fold, And all the pomp, that had arrayed His presence, when the King was by, Now dropped as cumbrous pageantry; He wore his robe of evening-shade. IX. The Stranger, careful, watched this vest; Scarce breathed the sigh, that heaved his breast, Nor even the gauntlet-hands ungrasped, That, on his first approach, he clasped; Nor did his lifted step advance, Lest any sound might break the trance, That spread it's blessing veil of peace Upon the sorrows of that face. So rapt the Warrior stood and still, His very plume obeyed his will, Nor waved, nor trembled on the air, But watched, like mourning honours, there. X. Changed were sleep's soothing visions now; A frown shot o'er the father's brow. He breathed a deep, yet feeble moan, As if his dreams had sorrow known; And shuddering with the muttered tone, The fancied grief, his senses own, He starts. A knight in armour there! In silence by his sleeping chair! How has he passed, unheard, unseen, By those, who wait without the screen— The page and chaplain waiting there? An armed knight before his chair! XI. He gazed, with startled, anxious eye, Yet marked, as soared the plume on high, The mimic red-rose, blooming by, And, where the vizor overspread Eyes, whose keen fire, through Pity's tear, A softened, trembling lustre shed, (As stars through fleecy clouds appear.) By that red-rose and gentle tear He knew a knight of Lancaster; And by that glance, those features bold, That gallant air, that warlike mould, He knew his race and lineage old; And, while his knee the Knight had bent, And reverently, with humble head, Craved shelter in his Abbey's nave, Meek from his chair the Father leant, And, with spread hands, his blessing gave And words of kindly import said. “Baron Fitzharding! welcome here.—” The Abbot paused in generous fear. “Welcome! alas! that may not be, In lodgment with your enemy. Ill-come! I fear, in this sad hour, Where you may rue Duke Richard's power; For here, this night, his court he keeps, While royal Henry captive sleeps.” XII. Now, when he heard his King was there, Fitzharding all things well could dare, To see and greet his royal lord. But soon the Father's solemn word Assured him the attempt were vain. Duke Richard's guard and courtier-train So closely hemmed the conquered King, That such adventure might even bring Death on himself, and dread to all Sheltered within the Abbey wall. Nay, if the Baron here were seen, Request and bribe might fail to screen From Richard's sudden rage the life, Sought by him foremost in the strife. XIII. Fitzharding felt a flush o'erspread His cheek—and sternly raised his head, At mention of request to shield His life from him he sought in field; But checked his speech, and quelled his pride, While he stood by the Abbot's side. The Father spoke with pitying sigh, “In secret cell you safe may lie Till the dark storm has passed by; And such a shrouding cell is nigh, But must be sought without delay, For even here 'twere death to stay.” And, while he spoke, he looked behind And listened, in his chair reclined— 'Twas but the hollow moaning wind. And then he asked by what dark way The Knight this chamber did essay? XIV. Again a sound; and now was heard A heavy step draw nigh; He left unsaid th' attempted word, And backward turned his eye, Where, distant, stretched the oaken screen And paler grew his pallid cheek, While his dim eyes the footsteps seek Of one without—unseen. He signed Fitzharding to depart And wait within, till signal made: But the firm Warrior's swelling heart, His lingering footstep stayed. XV. From the carved screen and ante-room A Monk, with countenance of gloom, Came forth with feeble pace and slow, With frequent pause and stated bow; The shaven circlet on his head No scapulary dark o'erspread, Nor dimmed the pale lines on his brow, Or the faint downcast eye below; Yet, as he came with sullen tread, No word of fear or hope he said, Till he had reached the Father's chair, And bent him low in reverence there. Then faint he spoke—“Duke Richard sends; He my Lord Abbot's will attends.” XVI. Scarce had he said, when martial stride, Quick, firm, and true, was heard without; A page the folded door threw wide, And then arose a distant shout Of men exulting in their choice From court beyond; and nearer voice Affecting to restrain the cheer, As ill-timed and unseemly here; Then steps again, and ring of steel From chainlet and from armed heel. That voice burst on Fitzharding near, Like trumpet on the charger's ear. And even the Abbot's warning glance Might scarce restrain the Knight's advance; Till the pale Father waved his hand With look of absolute command, And pointed whither he should go; So panted he to meet the foe, Who held his royal master low. No time for speech, or word, of grace; So near and rapid was the pace, He scarce might close the Chapel door, Ere the Duke trod the Abbot's floor. Such present haste became him well, Whose lengthened councils and debate So long had made the Father wait, And kept him from his nightly cell Beyond the hour himself had named, For urging rights himself had claimed. XVII. Now, where small Gothic window drew It's open tracery in the wall; Fitzharding, all unseen, might view Duke Richard in the Abbot's hall; And, with stern interest, survey How he had borne the battle-day:— He, whom, last seen in narrow space, Fitzharding challenged face to face; And surely had him prisoner made, But for his henchmen's sudden aid. Now by the Abbot's quiet chair He sat, with proud yet troubled air; His plume and casque were laid aside, For lighter cap, of crimson pride, Graced with the budding rose of snow: Dark was his eye, and flushed his brow: Ill pleased he seemed, though conqueror, As if but loftier sufferer; And weariness his face o'erspread. Rough was each word, and hoarse, he said; For loud command, debate and fray Had worn his voice, through that long day. XVIII. He came to claim the Abbot's word, That he would not in secrecy Shield a Lancastrian enemy; And some were even there, he heard,— Some, he well knew, were in these walls, Ready anew to stir up brawls: Each such he claimed for prisoner; They had provoked the cruel war. The Abbot, mild, yet firm, replied,— The Church must shelter those, who sought For sanctuary at her side; Not mock the laws she always taught. He would not, dared not break her laws, However high the temporal cause. If such men were these walls within, Here must they rest, unsought, unseen. He craved the Duke would not profane The rights his duty must maintain. XIX. Richard gave prompt and brief reply, That lightly he would ne'er defy The Church's right of sanctuary; But these were times when such Church law Would loose the chain, that held in awe The guilty and the dangerous man. He would not answer for the end, How strict soe'er his orders ran, If his men found an enemy Were screened in aisle or monastery; Then must the Church herself defend! 'Twere better silently to yield, For once, the sanctuary's shield, And point where foes might lie concealed; Lest blood the Abbey-pavement stain, And all the Church's guard were vain. XX. He paused—the Father silent sate, Reluctant to provoke debate, Though scornful of Duke Richard's threat; And, when his look the threatener's met, His trembling limbs confessed his ire, And, his eyes flashed with transient fire, That glowed an instant on his cheek, And thus his thronging thoughts might speak; “If blood on sacred ground be shed, The punishment is sure and dread.” XXI. The prudent Abbot ceased awhile, And calmed his eye and smoothed his brow; For he had seen Duke Richard's smile— Dark smile of scorn! portending woe. “I will not vouch my soldiers' grace, No, not in Alban's chariest place! His very shrine may be profaned; His very shroud with gore be stained: Yield then my enemies in peace, And then all fear and care may cease.” XXII. The Father, rising from his chair, In horror of Duke Richard's speech, And heedless of such fear or care, Disdained all words, that would beseech; And thus he said, “An instant doom Falls on the wretch, if such there be, Who violates St. Alban's tomb, Or trespasses on sanctuary! Of all St. Alban's sons, not one But would avenge his Saint, or die, And triumph in such glory won, And yield his life without a sigh! And, for the rest, if soldier dare Rive private door or private stair, Or climb, in sordid search of prey,— For the last Ban let him prepare, The Ban I shudder but to say! Think you, my lord, I will betray My church, or break her smallest law? Her thunders still her foes shall awe. To her high power then, yield the sway, The power, that even kings obey! With reverend step tread honoured ground; With proud submission guard her bound.” XXIII. Faintness came o'er the Father's face; He paused; then said with milder grace, “My lord, you granted Abbey-guard; Give us not mockery for ward.— Now, spare my age and wearied state; Spare me yet longer-drawn debate.” XXIV. “Lord Abbot! if, within your walls, By monkish hand one soldier falls, Blood will o'erflow your aisles, your halls: Revenge will then be soldiers' food!” Here Richard curbed his angry mood; Then coldly said “he would not keep The Father from his timely sleep. Doubtless the guard would still prove good, While it was viewed with gratitude; But certain chiefs, whom he would name, It was his firm resolve to claim: They were now hid, as he had proof,” And sheltered 'neath his Abbey's roof: Those dangerous men must be resigned, As the good monks would favour find.” XXV. Fitzharding, in the chapel near, When he Duke Richard's lofty word, Demanding certain chieftains, heard, Felt shuddering dread for kinsman dear. Breathless attention now he paid To hear each claim, that Richard made. At first, as every name went by, This was the Father's prompt reply, “He knew not that such Chief was here; He might be—laid upon his bier.” Duke Richard then Earl D'Arcy named, And the Knight's sire for prisoner claimed. The Abbot paused; then faltering said, “He lies within the Abbey—dead!” XXVI. In sudden shock of grief, the son Clasped his strong gauntlet hands on high, And moved with hasty step of one, Who every fortune would defy. Duke Richard turned a distant glance; His looks his true surmise reveal; “Methought I heard the clash of steel!” That voice recalled the Knight to sense; He checked the footstep in advance. Ill might his dread the Abbot hide, Or the Duke's searching eye abide, As sternly from his chair he rose The lurking danger to expose:— “I pray—Lord Abbot—pardon me, If I suspect an enemy.”— “My Lord, no enemy is near, Whom you have any cause to fear. Pass not into my private cell, Forbear, my Lord!—it were not well.” The Abbot's voice with terror shook, But prudently he ruled his look. XXVII. Duke Richard paused, and turned away, Awed partly by this just reproof; But he had motives, too, aloof From such as on the surface lay, For yielding to the Abbot's sway. “This sudden crash of hidden arms,” He said, “might justify alarms.”— “No hidden arms are here, my lord; And trust, I pray, my solemn word;” (The Abbot spoke to be o'erheard) “Who first that sacred ground assails, Be he or enemy or friend, On him the Ban of Church prevails; And he beneath that scourge shall bend.” XXVIII. Slowly the Duke resumed his chair, “'Tis well!” he said; “so let it fare; For that same chief, whom last I named, In this day's fatal business famed— For him, he rests within your wall, But not beneath the funeral pall; He lives within your Abbey gate; In chamber near, perchance, may wait.”— He viewed the chapel-door, and frowned, Where the son sheltered in it's bound, Thrilled by conflicting hopes and fears, Those words of unmeant comfort hears. XXIX. Vainly the Father might deny Such Chief were here in sanctuary; As vainly Richard spoke of proof, That he now lived beneath this roof. The Abbot told of monks, who viewed The body stretched upon a bier, And borne through aisle and chancel near; Such solemn proof could not delude! The corpse passed Abbot Hugo's tomb, At evening-bell, through twilight gloom, While chantry-priests bewailed his doom! XXX. These words o'erheard, swift to the heart Of the pale son their poison dart. But Richard's accents, once again, Assuaged the keenness of his pain: He almost loved his direst foe, Who thus threw hope upon his woe: “How might they view,” Duke Richard said, “The visage of the warrior dead, If o'er it evening-gloom were spread?”— The Abbot sadly smiled, and sighed, And falteringly, again replied: “The tapers on that chantry-shrine, As solemn witnesses, did shine Full on the dead man's brow; So those who chaunted requiem, know.” XXXI. Duke Richard said, “That might not be. He had himself strange certainty— Strange tale!—he would not farther speak Of that, which made the bravest weak, Of Superstition's gloomy spell; But clear and simple fact would tell.” And then he spoke of “certain men, Pikemen, on guard within the porch, (The curfew-bell was sounding then) Who saw that Knight, in arms all plain, March by and pass beneath the arch, Or saw him rather run than march,— They saw him by their own watch-torch! He went before a warrior dead, Yet heard they not his iron tread, Though clad in arms from heel to head. It might be that he stepped so light To 'scape unknown the pikemen's sight. They did not challenge him, 'twas true; But he passed clearly to their view. His vizor up, his beaver down, Disclosed the fixtness of his frown; Yet could they not his face have seen, Like ghastly shade,” they said, “between, (Richard gave smile of satire keen) But that a warder dropped his pike, Which he might think just raised to strike, And, as he turned a sudden glance, Seeming to couch his demi-lance, Their torch flashed full upon his brow, And showed the frowning eye below. Yet checked they not his path, through dread Of thwarting spirit of the dead! But, fixed by terror of his eye, Watched him in warlike march pass by. Thus to their Knight they story told Of spectre of a warrior cold. Such strange and wayward humours sway Men, who dread nought, on battle day!” XXXII. He ceased, while grave the Abbot sate, As pondering on some tale of fate; And on his face an awful thrill Spoke, more than words, some dread of ill. Duke Richard felt that thrilling look; His mind with wondering doubt was shook; And, though he scorned each monkish spell, A secret dread he might not quell Lay on his soul, like sullen gloom On hills, ere yet the storm is come. He spoke not; all was still around In the wide chamber's dusky bound,— So still, you might have heard the sound, Far off and doubtful to the ear, Of that low, sullen thunder growl, From clouds, that on th' horizon scowl— The herald of the storm's career!— So still, you might have heard a cry Of faint lament from distant aisle; Or step, in secret gallery, Stealing upon some deed of guile; Or whisper in the Chapel nigh Of the lone Knight's heavy sigh. XXXIII. Still mused the Sire in deepest thought, His look with fearful meaning fraught. “'Twas strange!” (at length he raised his face) Such warlike port and silent pace! And strange that soldiers at a glance Should stand appalled, nor step advance To thwart a living warrior, From whom in fight they would not stir.” He mused again, with brow intent; While Richard, silent, forward bent. The Father raised not up his head, While, pausing oft, he slowly said, “If such an image they have seen, I guess it wore not earthly mien. It might be spirit lingering near It's mortal corpse, borne on the bier. And that same hour of curfew, too, Tended to make the tale seem true. That the guard failed to summon, straight, Some reverend priest to th' Abbey gate I marvel much: for such good men Were gathered round the wounded then, Whose presence and whose single word Had stronger proved than pike or sword.” XXXIV. Duke Richard checked a scornful smile, And said, with meaning fraught with guile, “Earl D'Arcy lives; his son, perchance, May rest here in some mortal trance, And, by a strong similitude, Have caused his semblance to delude. But, if he live—that younger Knight, Who sought me in this morning's fight, Baron Fitzharding I would claim, Though fire and sword should thwart my aim. Nay, wife or kinsman I would take, Till he surrendered for their sake!” XXXV. “It could not be such knight, my Lord—” The Abbot checked his thoughtless word, And paused confused; then tried to speak While sudden crimson flushed his cheek; And, when again he raised his brow, He met Duke Richard's searching glance, Fixed, watchful, o'er his silent trance, And reading all his fears might show. “That knight,” said Richard, “in the fray, I drove in headlong flight away—” Guileful he spoke—“He fled my blow, And fell by other hand, they say.” Again the Duke his dark eye bent Upon the Abbot's face, intent. XXXVI. But, ere the Father might reply, The Baron's step in Chapel nigh Confirmed his fearful agony. Not tamely could Fitzharding hear Richard's false tales of flight and fear. His heart and every nerve throbbed high With indignation and disdain Of yielding to so foul a stain. He turned toward the chamber-door (So, for a moment, did he err) To dare his artful slanderer, And grasped his sword—but checked his rage; For shall the Father's chilling age Be shocked with view of human gore, Shed—even his feeble sight before? And—for himself—was this a time To seek a contest, when no crime Could seem so great as victory, Or rouse such fell malignity, Or place him in such jeopardy? XXXVII. But Richard had that footstep heard, And, while his eye with anger burned, He sternly to the Abbot turned, And claimed again his solemn word, Truly and promptly now to tell What footstep paced within his cell. He guessed that place did foe conceal, For surely it was foot of steel. He grasped his dagger while he spoke, So did the thought his rage provoke. The Father, that the Knight might hear, Spoke loud—“My Lord, upon this ground You have not enemy to fear; No man so desperate may be found To threaten life, or draw blood here.” The Duke's dark aspect proved too well He read the Abbot's warning speech, And that he judged within the cell An enemy lay in his reach. He answered, “Ere from hence I go, You must yourself, Lord Abbot, show Who clad in arms, what warrior bold, Makes a monk's cell his secret hold. He bears, perchance, some noble name, And has achieved high deeds of fame; Yet—him for prisoner I claim!” XXXVIII. While to these words his taunting eye Gave double point and energy, He rose, and near the Chapel drew; But with deliberate step he went, And gesture made, as if to sue The Abbot for his full consent; And signed, that he should lead the way, And from his cell dislodge the prey. The Father, seeing it were vain Longer the struggle to maintain, Sought only to ward off the blow, And warn the sheltered Knight to go. Toward the chapel, lingering slow, He paced, and spoke in lofty tone Duke Richard's name, and would alone Have passed; but this increased distrust, And Richard, straight, the portal burst! XXXIX. All sullenly he gazed around The pillared Chapel's lighted bound; A gloomy fire flashed in his eye, The lightning of a stormy sky; Knight, priest, nor warrior, there was found. But, when he saw St. Dunstan's door, He strode athwart the solid floor; And, with a firm, impatient grasp, Struggled to force the iron-clasp. St. Dunstan seemed the pass to guard, The Saxon door held faithful ward. XL. The Abbot, now no more subdued By terrors for the Knight, Quickly regained his tranquil mood, And stood upon his right Of undisturbed possession there, Whether of chamber, cell, or stair. He grieved intrusive step to see, Profane his private sanctuary. Duke Richard coldly said, “'Twas plain His enemies had not been thought That sanctuary to profane, Or here they had not refuge sought.” XLI. He spoke; and pointed to the sword The Knight had laid, with pious word, Upon the altar nigh, When he had there himself resigned, Where only he could comfort find, And balm for misery! Duke Richard held the sword aloof Before the Abbot, in sure proof He there had screened some enemy; That sword the Father might not see But with a mingled agony Of gratitude, respect and fear, For him, who was, alas! too near. XLII. With saintly smile the Abbot viewed This offering of a mind subdued; Duke Richard, in amazement, frowned, And every generous thought disowned. Some way he hoped to find, ere long, Might reach those hid within these walls, Whose shelter he thought bitter wrong. “Lord Abbot! whatsoe'er befalls, Blame not the deeds may hence ensue; These deeds have been provoked by you!” XLIII. With haughty eye and cheek, that burned, Straight to the Abbot's hall he turned, Bearing the falchion of his foe, While vengeance dark sat on his brow. A parting gesture slight he gave; Stately the Abbot stood and grave, Nor sought, by look, or argument, To win his passions to relent. And, as he drew near to the screen, The Abbot's page, with humble mien, Brought message brief from Warwick's lord,— Required Duke Richard's present word On subject high, that might not wait;— The board were sitting in debate. XLIV. Straight, Richard to the council went; And thus, in mutual discontent, Parted the victor and the sire— The victor, with disdainful ire, The Abbot, with a meek desire To save Fitzharding's threatened life, And keep from sacrilegious strife, From envious and irreverend search, His Abbey-precincts and his Church. He sought the Knight; but still his guard, The Saxon door, held sturdy ward. No voice beyond in gallery Gave to his friendly call reply; And, with a weary sigh, he sought His cell, though peopled 'twas with thought, With spectre-cares of many a day, Still thronging where he silent lay: There he resolved awhile to lie, Hoping Fitzharding might be nigh. XLV. Wearied and worn with grief and fears, Vainly he mourned, that at his years He took the burthen up again Of Abbey-honours he thought vain, And had resigned, foreseeing crime And tumult in this fearful time; But, weary of a long repose, He, whom, his grateful monks re-chose, Resumed his honours at life's close, To be the lord and slave of men. And now was come that evil day, When the land bore divided sway. Behold him now, in mitred chair Of rule, of honour and of care; Behold his trembling age reclined On thorny pillows, 'broidered o'er With pageantries, that ceased to blind The vanities of years before; And hear him mourn his comfort lost, Wisdom, o'ercome by love of power, The peace of age by worldly passion tossed. XLVI. Yet kindly conscious was the thought That his last toil had not been vain, To save from rage, or thirst of gain, His Abbey, nigh to ruin brought. His care had rescued her from woe, And bade her former grandeur glow; Repaired her walls and cloisters grey, And o'er them thrown the tinted ray (Through windows traced with legend story) Of tinted lights of Melancholy; Such as she loves to muse beneath, Whether with rose, or cypress wreath, (Rapture and sadness meek, in emblem there) When the last, western gleam Shoots a long, trembling beam O'er the bold Norman arch and walks afar; And Evening's choral hymn, the while, Swells high, and falls along the aisle. END OF THE SEVENTH CANTO. CANTO VIII. SOLEMN WATCH WITHIN THE ABBEY. I. Fitzharding, when his steps withdrew (Hard triumph gained!) from Richard's view, Resolved, while through the gallery's shade Indignantly and sad he strayed, To learn at once his father's fate, Nor the securer hour await; And o'er the aisle he bent to see If there the Monk, his guide, might be. II. Changed was the solemn scene below, Where monks with stillness, to and fro, Had borne the dead to place of rest, Or shrived the spirit, while possest (Though with so transient potency) Of frail home of mortality. Now from the aisles the crowd was gone: By the death-torch, the Watch-monk lone Stood dimly o'er the blood-stained bier, Seeming some shadowy shape of Fear! While that torch strange, a grisly hue O'er the dead warrior's visage threw. Now heavy-falling steps around No more disturbed the distant ground; The bearers from their toil reposed; The cloister's distant door was closed; From chantry-tomb and chapel nigh Was sunk the soothing minstrelsy: All in the aisle was hushed in death, When Clement ventured from beneath. III. He ventured on the secret stair To warn Fitzharding to beware; For, 'mong the bands of Richard's host, Who round the Abbey-porches lay, Short words, o'erheard at whiles and lost, Proved, that they watched Lancastrian prey. Their enemies, they said, had found Refuge within the Abbey-bound. Church-law with taunt of scorn they named; Talked of “good sword” and “Churchman tamed.” Then earnestly he urged the Knight To rest in gallery that night. IV. Fitzharding paused not, ere he said, Too long had he the torture proved Of hope and fear for those he loved, To suffer any weightier dread. Concealed he would no longer stay, But search where dead or wounded lay. Then asked he if the Monk had seen A lifeless warrior-chief borne by St. Hugo's tomb at dusk of e'en, When priest sung in his chantry nigh. But Clement at such hour had slept, Worn out with vigils he had kept. The chantry-monk, who requiem sung, Dwelt in St. Julian's subject-cell; And there had duly gone, when rung That cell's accustomed evening-bell. V. Again the Monk Fitzharding warned, Dangers unseen might not be scorned; And there were brothers in the aisle Would willingly his steps beguile, If a Lancastrian knight they knew; But, if he still the worst must dare, A monkish garment he would spare, Might shade him slightly from their view. The Baron liked not frock and hood, As covering for a spirit brave; But fully spoke his gratitude, And, farther, did the watchword crave. VI. In earnest speech then craved the Knight The counter-signal for the night. “‘Peace be on earth!’ shall be your guide, And shield you through this Abbey wide; But if, as knight, you rashly show Your rank,—though cased from top to toe, You cannot 'scape the secret hate, That dwells in our divided state. Duke Richard's soldiers are abroad; And where, Sir Knight, is your good sword?” VII. Fitzharding, as from dream amazed, On the disarmed scabbard gazed; And now, of weapon's aid bereft, (No other means of safety left) He yielded to a proffered guise; And o'er his stately harness threw The Benedictine draperies Of ample width and sable hue. He doffed the plumage from his brow, But kept the casque of steel below; O'er which a monkish cowl was thrown, That hid his visage in it's frown. VIII. Clement, ere to the aisle he led, These parting words of warning said:— “Now mark the way I bid you go, And step with prudent care and slow, For warrior's step may ill agree With cloistered man's tranquillity. Pass not athwart the nave, I pray, Though there may lie your shortest way; For in the cloister-pier, beside, Darkling, a watch-monk doth abide; Nor pass the choir before the shrine, For, there the wonted tapers shine, And watchers in the gallery wait, And guard that place, with solemn state; But by the shrine of Humphrey march, Then onward, through the eastern arch That leads behind St. Alban's bier; Then through our Lady's Porch, and here Step quietly, like sandalled man, Or charnel-monk thy gait will scan. Our Lady's Shrine go thou not nigh; The chantry of St. Blaize pass by. The Altar of four-wax lights shun, And the East turret's lurking stair; The Abbey's northern porch beware. Without, Duke Richard's soldiers wait— Our guard, or—as may be—our fate!” IX. “Then turn thee on King Offa's aisle, Who, from the roof, shall on thee smile; Pause not, nor look, till thou hast gained The Transept at the western end, Where shrined Amphibalus is laid:— Then, speed thou to the deeper shade. But if thy steps are watched, then wend Where Michael and St. Patern bend, To guard the northern transept's bound; Within a turret-stair is found, That leads to thin arched wall, on high, Where thou, as here, secure may'st lie. So fare thee well! I bless thy way, And will assist thee as I may.” Ere hasty thanks the Knight could pay, Clement upon the aisle looked out; No shape appeared of priest, or scout. He signed Fitzharding swift away. X. Long watched the Monk, where, on the aisle, The Warrior trod in his dark weed; Ill might such stalk his rank beguile, Or figure be for monk's received. He watched him by Duke Humphrey's tomb, Where, from the roof's light filagree, Blazed tapers through the vaulted gloom, While voices sung his obsequy. He watched him through the eastern arch, Where once St. Catherine's story shone;— The Knight has turned on Mary's Porch,— The monk is to his pallet gone. XI. St. Mary's Porch the Knight has turned; 'Twas well the tomb-lights dimly burned; They showed not even the windows tall, That graced, in fretted state, the wall; Nor yet St. Alban's Chapel there, His arches pointing fine in air, Of loftiest grace and beauty rare. Eastward Fitzharding cast his eye, Beyond St. Mary's portal high, That showed her in her distant shrine Of lily and of eglantine; Beneath appeared a dismal sight— Her altar, hung with sable hue, Where yellow tapers ranged to view, Shed forth a melancholy light. Fitzharding sighed, who, all too well, The language of those lights could spell; And that of the faint strain, that rose, With voice of soul, from chapel nigh— The Sequence for the last repose, While yet the dead unburied lie! In silent thought awhile he stood, With folded arms and shading hood, And deep moan rent his breast; Then slowly o'er the gloomy ground He drew, to catch the nearer sound Of “Rest—eternal Rest!” XII. Sudden, from forth a darkened nook A dreary voice spoke near, “Beware!” Then paused, and seemed to say, “Prepare!” It might have come from grave forsook, So strange, so thrilling was the tone. He looked the way that warning came, Low lying waved a dark red flame; He saw that dusky torch alone, Until it's lengthening gleam made known, How thick the new-made graves were strewn Beyond. He trembled at this sight, Musing for whom these graves might wait; What gallant comrades of the fight, What friend, what kinsman, here this night Might come unto his last estate! The grave all still and patient lay, As if it knew, though long their stay, They might not cheat it of it's prey. Sudden, Fitzharding thought, that here Would rest, perchance, his father's bier! With horror struck and deep dismay, He turned him from this scene away. XIII. His step called forth that voice unknown; It muttered in sepulchral tone, “Beware! the earth is heaped around; The graves are opened on this ground!” Sullen and dim a form appeared, And the low-lying torch it reared, Showing a face to him unknown; It reared the torch, and showed it's own. A form so tall, so spare and gaunt Might have been drawn to image Want; And well the ghastly face supplied The look of one for food had died: So livid, pale, so grim, so shrunk, The visage of this charnel-monk! Ardent and haggard were his eyes, And full of evil dark surmise; Yet gleamed, at whiles, all fiery red, Just where the cowl its darkness shed. His figure, draped in weed of woe, Did a bossed symbol grimly show, Bones and an eyeless head. This shape of terror, with no name, (While on their wormy verge he stood) As home and empire seemed to claim The graves, o'er porch and chapel strewed. XIV. He held the torch before the Knight; And, whether glance of helmet bright From forth his veiling hood might stray, Or that the cowl so baffling lay, It seemed suspicion to excite, He claimed the watchword of the night. And when Fitzharding said his say, And from the porch had passed away, That Monk stood on King Offa's aisle, With folded arms and steps astride, And watched him with a lowering smile, As though he muttered, “Ill betide!” The gilded spurs, too sure, I ween, Beneath the Knight's dark skirt were seen. XV. Now when Fitzharding reached the end, Where Mercian Offa from the vault Looked down, and seemed to bid him halt, He turned a backward glance to send. The Monk was gone; but, in his stead, Leaned forward from a pillar's shade, A gauntlet hand and helmet head; Another yet behind stood near, Who in the gloom might scarce appear, And cautious gesture made. Far were they from the guard's last torch, Just where the Abbey's northern porch And Mary's Ante-chapel met; Beyond, Duke Richard's guard was set. XVI. Abrupt, then in the shade they drew, As if to shun Fitzharding's view. The Baron well bethought him then Of the Monk Clement's charge:— “Pause not, nor turn to look again, Till you have gained the marge, Where the north aisle and transept join.” He judged this charge important sign, And, instant, passed upon the way, Where the dread nave and transept lay. As o'er that scene a glance he gave, Where every tomb and lowly grave And altar-slab and dim shrine near, Was now a warrior's bleeding bier, He checked his step, lest suddenly Some face beloved he there might see. XVII. He had been in the front of war, Nor ever feared the deadly scar; Had seen his comrades fall beside, And shrunk not from the battle's tide; Intent alone the foe to stem, He felt not for himself nor them; But now, when zeal, nor passion, bore Their wonted sway his thronged mind o'er; When stilly he might see and know Each written character of woe; And view, perchance, some well-known face, All changed and shrunk from living grace; Unconquerable dread arose, To meet what Death might thus disclose! The animated look—the eye, That had so oft, all smilingly, Dwelt on his with a kindly joy,— How might he view, now stern and dim, Bend not one beam of soul on him; Nor turn, at sound of step, or voice, So oft its signal, to rejoice? XVIII. Scarce could Fitzharding's limbs sustain The burden of his shuddering pain; He stood, and on a pillar leaned, While some brief moments intervened. Brief must they be; for, even then, Behold! far off in Offa's aisle, With stealthy step, those armoured men, Whom he well knew for watchful guile. Mindful then of the turret near, Pointed by Clement's prudent fear, He through the northern transept stept, Where St. Amphibalus long slept. In passing by that gorgeous shrine, He to the watch-monks gave the sign— “Peace be on earth!” He spake no more; But sought that little turret's door Deep in the angle, where it lay And shaded from the shrine's strong ray. XIX. He stood, and watched, some little space, On the sad threshold of the place;— That circling stair was still in shade, By thickness of the old wall made. But, could he gain the gallery, The shrine-lights through the tracery, Darting so high a feeble ray, Would guide him on the narrow way. Fitzharding sought that narrow stair, And trod it's gloomy path with care, Yet, sometimes, 'gainst the narrow bound Struck his steeled foot, with startling sound; His harnessed shoulders broad would graze The strait walls of these secret ways. Twice round the newel had he pressed, When his foot found a level rest. From high poured forth the midnight air, Through loop-hole of the turret-stair. He traced not now the second flight, For, at short distance on the right, Faint ray amid the darkness streamed, And through an arch the gallery gleamed. XX. Soon as Fitzharding passed the arch, He stepped with calm and firmer march, And backward threw his baffling cowl, And looked and breathed with freer soul. But now the narrow gallery Had nigh his venturous footstep stayed; The pillars' base so close did lie, Scarce might he pass behind their shade. That course of pillars still is seen Along the massy wall, With rude, misshapen arch between Each pillar short and small. It fronted then the shrine and tomb Of him, who shared St. Alban's doom. XXI. Here might awhile Fitzharding wait Till Richard's scouts their watch abate; And, from this transept's southern end, Above the nave itself might wend And pass above the western door, Behind the parapet's high breast; Thence glance the long, long vista o'er, To farthest shrine of Mary blessed, Seen through the pointed arches near, That rose above St. Alban's bier. Thus far the Knight may range, and view The death-scene many a heart shall rue, The battle's prey—the mighty slain Stretched out, and watched on marble plain. Whence then that gallery might go Around on high, or deep below; Or leading o'er the cloister walk, Where the unconscious monk may stalk; Or to the Abbot's secret room, Where Richard late decreed his doom; Or to the inmost cell, wrought there; Or to deep winding fatal stair— Few living in the Abbey knew. For, hidden far from searcher's view, Was many a flight and passage dim To vaulted hall and chamber grim; To crypt and sepulchre and shrine; And prison cells, that undermine The cloister-walk, and seem to spread Almost to lowly Ver's old bed. XXII. Just where nave, choir, and transept met, And Death with splendour was beset, Fitzharding stood and looked below O'er all the scene of varied woe. And thus it lay beneath his sight— The western aisles were stretched in night, Save the shrined transept's rays Threw the full splendour of its blaze 'Thwart the choir-steps and 'slant the nave. There, every altar-tomb and grave, As that long line of glory fell, Showed its dead warrior, all too well. Before those steps three altars stood Arranged in row—Oswyn's the good, St. Thomas, and the sad Marie, Now 'reft of pomp and imagery. There priests kept solemn watch around Three knights, in bleeding armour bound. XXIII. The silver censer, burning near, Sent incense o'er each marble bier; And poursuivants, in tabard-pride, Stood mute those warriors beside. No 'scutcheon blazoned high was there; But tattered banners on the air, Sad witness of their master's fate, Now, as mute mourners, seemed to wait. Rose not the stately canopy, With crowded lights, o'er hearse on high; While troops of mourners, watching round, Might creep to hear the Requiem sound. Not such the solemn watch held now, No lofty hearse—no mourners bow; Nor blaze of tapers high in air; Nor likeness of the dead was there. The dead, each in his arms arrayed, Exposed to many an eye was laid, Forsaken save by heralds vain, Nor mourned, but in the death-priests' strain. XXIV. By presence of the state-watch due, The Knight his dead commander knew; But, who are those on either hand, Censed and laid out on altars high? Nobles they seem of Henry's band, Whose poursuivants are watching by. Vainly Fitzharding might assay To read each visage where it lay, Or spell the armour, crest, or shield; Their glimmer only was revealed By the long slanting ray. XXV. The farthest aisles and westward nave, Where only gleamed upon a grave A watch-torch dim and lone, Gave solemn contrast to the choir, Which beamed as with celestial fire, Like to half-clouded sun. From Alban's glorious shrine that light Streamed through the chancel's gloomy night; For, though the Abbot's prudent care Had moved each jewel rich and rare, Brought far, as pilgrim-offering, By noble knight, or prince, or king, Yet, trusting to the love and dread, That blessed Alban's shrine o'erspread, It's pillars, laid with golden plate, Fixed in the pavement, that sustained The crystal canopy of state And golden bier, firm-set remained; And specious show, with truth that vied, And blazed amid the taper's beams, The pendent lamps and torch-light gleams, Was left to soothe the Victor's pride. XXVI. That rich and lofty canopy, With ever-burning lights crowned high, Supported by four golden towers, Seemed all within as crystal bowers Branched o'er his coffin laid beneath; So richly spread each dazzling wreath! Below the centre arch of three, That opened to the chapelry, Were scrolled, in silent eloquence, Lines from the dread hymn of sequence, Where late his golden crown had been; His priests and monks, in band around, Watched, patient, o'er the honoured scene, And Abbey-knights in armour frowned. XXVII. St. Cuthbert's Chapel had not lent Its wide screen then to veil the choir, Where now it bounds the nave's ascent With the carved niche and Gothic spire: Nor rose before St. Alban's shrine, In lofty state, as now is seen, The altar's more elaborate screen; Of fairy-filagree each line, Web-work each canopy and cell, Where many an imaged saint might dwell: Light are the flowery knots, that twine Round slender columns, clustered vine, That to the fretwork cornice go, Where flowers amid the foliage blow And wheaten sheafs and roses spread, Spell of the Abbot and the King Who raised—to guard St. Alban's bed— This rich and glorious offering. XXVIII. Not then this beauteous screen appeared To hide the bier the pilgrim sought, And cause the object of his thought To be more tremblingly revered; But veil of silk, or cloth of gold, Hung high and broad in sweeping fold, On days of chief solemnity. There only this night might you see A mourning drapery, like a pall, With ample grace sweep from the wall, In solemn memory of the dead, And half conceal the Martyr's bed; And seem, like evening-cloud, to throw Its darkness o'er day's gorgeous brow. XXIX. Westward, the nave, in deeper night, Brought little certain to the sight. Yet, where upon its lengthen'd gloom Was seen to glare a fixed torch-light, There lay a corpse upon a tomb, Or on some altar's marble pride; And there a monk sat, close beside. From one the glittering casque was gone, Whose wounds made known his fate, And stood, high-plumed, on altar-stone, Beside the warrior overthrown, As though it mocked his state. And many a dead form, from this height, Seemed semblance but of marble knight Extended in his sculptured weed, With ensigns high of daring deed. Nay, sometimes, side by side were laid The substance and the mimic shade, The marble knight and warrior dead: Now each alike unconscious lay, And which was corpse 'twere hard to say! XXX. There might be seen, too, side by side, The slayer and the slain. Those hostile hands, that shed life's tide, Still crimsoned with the stain Of either combatant's last blood, Now powerless lay, as stone, or wood. Mute now the voice, whose piercing sound Had sent dismay o'er distant ground, Whose high command was loved and feared; Not even its murmur now was heard. XXXI. And there, oh, sight of piteous woe! Lay gallant sire and son below, Who, hand and heart, for Henry's right Did, horse by horse, that morning fight. And there lay son (oh, thrilling view!) And father, who each other slew. Forced by the fate of civil strife, They struck, unknown, each other's life;— And, as they sunk, no more to rise, Each turned on each his dying eyes, Wailed the sad deed, and mixed their last drawn sighs. XXXII. By the north pillars of the nave, Four dedicated altars stood; Each bore a victim for the grave, And now was stained with noble blood: They faced those arches, sharp and tall, Where Offa and his beauteous queen, And Edward of the saintly mien, And mitred Lanfranc still are seen, Bending from carved capital, As watching o'er this mortal scene. Now, listen; for 'tis fearful all— All, that beneath Fitzharding's eye Lay, as he watched in gallery. He saw monks to this spot draw nigh, And o'er a pallid figure bend, And search again, if living breath Might linger in such shape of death; Then, silently, the limbs extend; And—by the glare the torches threw On the gashed face beneath his view, Upon St. Scytha's altar laid— Saw them the countenance compose, O'er the glazed eye the eye-lid close For ever—ever! in Death's shade! And, while he marked that awful sight, It seemed, by thrill of sympathy, As if cold fingers did alight Upon his lids, and on them lie. A horror ran through all his frame; But this more painful pang o'ercame— It seemed to him, that his sight now, While resting on the form below, Might view his father laid in death! With frenzied gaze he sought to know More certainly the face beneath— In vain! The torch's wavering glare To gallery high, through depth of air, Showed but a wan, dead visage there. XXXIII. In very ecstasy of dread He turned away his straining eyes; When, near him, through the gallery's shade, Where faint the altar-beams arise, A face—the phantom of his fear— It seemed his father's face were here. A something like a helmet gleamed, Figure or substance none there seemed Amid those shadows deep; Sad was the look, and ashy pale, As it would speak some dreadful tale, Yet must dread secret keep. Was this a face traced on the eye From the brain's fiery ecstasy? A vision sent to warn him, now, That his dead father lay below? A trace of soul—a look alone— A likeness, but as wrought in stone— So fixed, so absent, and so wan, Was all that met Fitzharding's sight, In glimpse, through shadows of the night; When soft the requiem from afar, Breathed blessedness upon the air, And at the sound it seemed to fade, And vanish in the distant shade. XXXIV. Long gazed the Knight where it had been. Such look of woe he once had seen Dwelling upon his father's mien. Long gazed he on the dusky space; Then drew the cowl upon his face, And closer folded his dark weed, And strove that phantasie to read. Then, bending o'er that gallery, He sought, once more, the face to see, So wan in death, below Features came faintly to his eyes; But memory, more than sight, supplies His father's reverend brow. XXXV. To end, at once, his torturing dread, He straight resolved to quit the shade; When, lo! from forth King Offa's aisle, With look and step of cautious guile, He marked two armoured men draw near, And rest them by that warrior's bier. So frowned the helmets he had seen From shade of that aisle's pillar lean; So bloomed the white-thorn for their crest; So gleamed the badge upon their breast. He knew them for the enemy, And guessed they meant him treachery: But, wherefore by that bier stood they? Was it a Yorkist there that lay? XXXVI. They bent, and gazed some little space Upon the warrior's deathy face. Fitzharding watched if they might show Gesture of triumph, or of woe. Steadfast they stood with bended head, Nor speech, nor gesture ventured. Then did the Baron surely know The warrior had not been their foe. A Yorkist thus, it seemed, lay here; And, losing his most pressing fear, He judged it prudent now to stay, Till passed Duke Richard's scouts away. And oft he marked them watch around, And draw within the shaded ground. XXXVII. In solemn memory of the dead Now from the choir the low notes spread Of midnight dirge and requiem; And to Fitzharding might they seem As hymn of some angelic band, Who on those honoured towers might stand To guide the spirit from below, And soothe with hope the mourner's woe. But, hark! a full and deeper sound Now answers from the cloister's bound! Soon as that mournful chaunt was heard, A gloom o'er all the choir appeared; While slowly o'er the high shrine fell The foldings of the funeral veil, Placed for the warriors' obsequy, And dropped, at midnight Dirige! XXXVIII. Murmuring far, where vaults unclose, The melancholy strain arose. The gallery where Fitzharding stood Fronted that cloister's northern door: Not one of heavy carved wood, With scroll ill-fancied covered o'er; But that most richly carved and light, With slender stems and foliage dight, As 'broidered with true leaf and flower, And traced with Gothic pointings tall, And canopied with fretwork small. Issuing beneath this mitred-arch, The fathers held their solemn march; Where the long vista-walk withdrew, Their taper lights gave them to view, And played upon the vaulted roof, And showed each fretted line aloof; There stood the tabernacled Saint, Blessing the porch. Each corbeil quaint With it's carved visage, looking down On all, who passed the arch below, With smile fantastic, or with frown, From under helmed, or mitred brow,— Was graved in light and shade so strong, Where the gleam waving passed along, That, as the fleeting shadows roved, You would have thought the features moved. XXXIX. The fathers came with solemn dirge And midnight chauntings for the dead; And, as they on the aisle emerge, Sudden their lifted tapers shed Long gleams upon each altar-bier, And showed the warrior resting near. Each monk, as to the choir he passed, A glance on the dead soldier cast. How various was the countenance, Thus lighted by the taper's glance! But, oh! that words each line might trace Of that appealing look of grace, (But words may not that glimpse define,) Which beamed from many a passing eye Of the cowled throng then crowding by— The look, that would to Heaven resign Each object of its sympathy! XL. While the choir-steps the train ascend, The silver censers steam on high; On them with frankincense attend The Prior and Sub-Prior nigh. (The aged Abbot stood not by.) They paused upon the marble bound, Where now St. Cuthbert's screen is found, And, ranging in half-circle round, O'er princely Somerset laid low, Their hundred lights, raised high, appear A curve of flame, wide round the bier; And they, to organ's solemn flow, Sang Dirige and Placebo. Whene'er their mourning voices fell, Stern spoke above the sudden knell, And then the farthest choir's reply Came murmuring, till, with finest swell, The loud notes filled the vaults on high, With grand and mournful harmony; And these the words that hymned by. XLI. THE CHOIR. “In regions of eternal light, Where Truth and Mercy never cease, Oh! may each summoned soul delight, And rest! for ever rest! in peace! I heard a seraph-voice speak nigh, And thus, in thrilling sound it said, ‘For ever blessed are the dead, Who faithful and repentant die!’” After high chorus through the vaulted sphere Had slowly sunk around the warrior's bier, This strain from monks in demi-chaunt arose, With many a solemn pause and touching close. SUNG ROUND THE BIER. To thee I lifted up mine eyes, To thee, upon the mountains throned! To thee, who spread the boundless skies, And hung them with thy worlds around.” The fathers ceased, and, from the choir again Swelled o'er the organ this resounding strain. THE CHOIR. “'Twas mine to hear a seraph-voice, And thus in thrilling words it said, ‘Repentance bids the soul rejoice; Repentance sanctifies the dead.’” The choral sounds sunk tremulously fine, As closed those solemn words—in hushing sign Of tender awe—sorrow by faith subdued— Stillness of spirit—meekest gratitude. Then the full grandeur of the organs rolled, Then soft, as if by pious peace controlled, Low murmured, while the mingled chorus passed From choir and bier, and calmer sadness cast. XLII. While rose this chorus soft and slow, The Knight, in trance of deepest woe, Listened till all was still below. And long, it seemed, that pious strain Lingered below each vaulted roof, And died, in murmurs far aloof, Lulling the first keen sense of pain. Silent, the watching Warrior grieved; Tears dimmed his manly eye, While the close corslet frequent heaved With many a deep-drawn sigh. CANTO IX. AMONG THE DEAD. I. Now when the midnight chaunt was o'er, And through the cloister's mitred door The monks had passed and gone, Came a pale vision on that way, Ill suiting with the morn of May, Ere long about to dawn. It came not, like the lark's gay voice, To waken Nature to rejoice; It came to mourn her perished bloom, Untimely gathered for the tomb, In summer prime, in wintry age, The ruddy youth, the silvered sage; It came the bitter tear to pour, The silent ranks of death t' explore. II. Long had that anxious train, apart, Watched for this hour with fearful heart; The hour when plunder's toil might end, And trembling relative and friend By feeble torch-light might discern The truth they sought, yet feared, to learn. The hour was come;—and where so late The trumpet's thrilling voice spoke fate; And charger's tramp o'er barrier-stones, And rattling arrows and wild groans Fiercely in dreadful chorus rose:— These, that had troubled the long day, This tumult all had died away, And left the town in deep repose. For, not the watch-word heard afar, Nor measured step-of guard of war, Humming the tune he might not sing, While pacing near his captive King, Nor feeble wail borne on the air, Through lattice-bar, from widowed fair,— Not these disturbed the stillness near; They gave it character more drear. And sometimes Horror's self would fling Her death-note from the raven's wing, When, from his watch-tower, perched alone, With ravening eye and ardent frown, Downward he flapped where none was by, To quaff the gory channel nigh. III. 'Twas at this hour of dreary rest, Mourners around the Abbey pressed. Fitzharding viewed those forms of woe Among the slaughtered warriors go; And, with dread sympathy, beheld, Of every age from youth to eld, Those mourners throw the searching glance For friends fled from their mortal trance Of fleeting turmoil here below; Friends, who had felt what these feel now, Ere their stilled hearts were cold, The pang, that friends alone can know, And never may be told! IV. He marked some rush with frenzied haste; So swift from bier to bier they paced, It seemed they had not time to know The wounded form of friend from foe. Yet, where the lawn lay o'er a face, Distorted sore by wounds and death, There would they pause some little space, And shuddering view what slept beneath. Others passed on this solemn scene, With firmer step and calmer mien, With stern fixed brow, where patience lay, As if themselves and Misery, After long strife for mastery, Were old companions on life's way. V. But, who is he in sable weeds, Whose heart in deepest sorrow bleeds? Who o'er yon warrior bends the head, Now laid upon his marble bed, Near princely Somerset outspread? The shading cowl has fallen aside, And shows the mourner's martial pride. He kneels beside a father's bier; While the priest brings the censer near, Takes from his boy in snowy stole The golden-plated incense bowl, And on the burning embers throws Myrrh and nard and eastern rose. The mourner rises from his knee, Prepared what most he dreads to see; He lifts the lawn from off the face; The cap of steel has left its place, And shows the honoured looks of age, Around a visage calm and sage, Profaned with many a gory trace. VI. As bends some sculptured form of woe Upon the twilight-tomb below, And may nor sigh nor tear bestow, Nor any living symptom show,— So viewed the son his father's bier Mutely and fixed, without a tear, While his cheek took the pallid hue Of the lorn face beneath his view. That look, reflected on his brain, Held and possessed him with its pain. His sinking eyes grew pale and dim, Yet still they seemed to gaze on him! Cold dews upon his brow prevail, Tremours his every nerve assail; Till consciousness and sorrow fail; And stupor dwells on all his soul With heavy, terrible control. VII. Fitzharding watched one mourner long, From bier to bier among the throng, Till he paused o'er a warrior dead, Disguised by wounds, distorted, dread, And mangled so that none could know. The helmet was not on his brow, Nor shield upon his breast was laid; It rested 'neath the tomb's low shade. But from that guardian shield beneath, From forth those shadows drear of death, Mute and forlorn, a dog crept near. No antics spoke his grateful cheer; No short quick bark, no stifled cry Pealed, as when step he loved was nigh; But by the stranger sad he stood, And upward looked, in doubting mood. VIII. A little spaniel dog was he, All silver-white his hair, Save some few spots of red-tawney, With forehead high and fair. His lively eyes were hazel bright, And mild and tender, too, And full of sympathy's quick light, Artless and warm and true. Full often gaily had he run In sport o'er field and wood, With his dear lord, round Alban's town, Now—crimsoned with his blood! And, all for sport, had sought this day His master's step afar, Till, coming where he bleeding lay Upon his bed of war, He knew him, through his dead disguise, And owned him promptly with loud cries; Then, silent, crouched him by his side, Faithful the utmost to abide. And when the monks came 'mong the slain, He, with quick paws and angry plain, Half bark, half howl, in efforts vain Still tried to guard his long-loved friend From stranger's foot, from stranger's hand. He saw them bring the gory shroud, And bear that helpless friend away; Then, fearless, 'mid the trampling crowd, He followed close—lamenting loud; Nor threat, nor blow, his steps could stay, Nor fair words his forbearance buy; And now beneath his bleeding bier, Though he might shed no mourner's tear, He paid him sorrow's obsequy. IX. Now, as the stranger turned his view, He his lost son's companion knew, And then the shield, from which he crept, Where he for hours mute watch had kept; Then was the mournful truth made plain A father could not doubt again: He saw his dead son resting here, And checked no more the bitter tear. The dog, who late had drooping stood With fixed and earnest eye, Soon as the stranger changed his mood To sorrow's ecstasy, Owned his dear master's sire in grief, And sprang, as if to give relief By sad responsive cry; And even strove those tears to dry, That now came rolling by. Stronger no human tongue could speak, Soothing and comforting, Than his, who dried the mourner's cheek, With tender minist'ring. The eye, that never tear had shed, Knew well that sign of woe; The heart, that never his pang had, Could sympathy bestow! X. Deem it not trivial that so long Has paused the solemn funeral song For tale of poor and humble friend, Where truth and simple goodness blend; Since gratitude, wherever found, Fidelity, sagacious love, In whatsoever shape they move, Claim praise where griefs abound. And 'mid this scene of mortal fate, Of raging passions, pride and hate, Oh! soothing,—soothing was the sound Of artless love and gratitude! Sweet as, in pause of tempest rude, The warble of some lonely flute, That seems its empire to dispute Awhile—but swells, and dies away At last, beneath the tempest's sway! Thus sweet and sad the memory, O! poor and faithful friend, of thee! XI. Still round the dead the mourners stray, Pause oft, and stoop upon their way, Till some known crest, or visage dear To changeless grief changed hope and fear. Sunk by degrees the moan of woe, From those, who claimed the dead below. Step after step departing fell, Paused at the porch, in last farewell, Till all is lone by tomb and bier, Save that a monk sits shadowy here, Or man-at-arms, at interval, Havock's and Death's grim sentinel, Muttered strange phrase ungenial. Now rolled the thunder, that had broke O'er distant hills, since curfew spoke; Now the forked lightning, passing by, Awoke the angel-form on high, Beneath the crystal tracery, And showed each secret gallery, Where, starting back into the night, Many a visage shrunk from sight. XII. Fitzharding, by the thunder roused, Thought of the sufferers still unhoused, Chased from their ranks to heath and wood, By civil treachery pursued, Plundered of arms and harness gear, And hiding from the murderers near. Then came the fear, that there might stray His father on the wild heath-way, Old and alone, robbed of his arms, Listening each step to new alarms; Till, worn by past and present toil, He sinks upon the bare, damp soil, And, stretched low on earthy bed, This tempest mocks his hoary head. Then came the fear—ah no, the hope Himself might with such evils cope; Then filled his mind this chiefest care— That he his father's fate might share! XIII. These thoughts awoke impatience high; He turned to leave the gallery, His father's fate elsewhere to learn, Though yet below Duke Richard's train, Feigning to guard a warrior slain, Guileful and still, wait his return. As his eyes o'er the gallery glance, Seemed a dim shadow to advance, Scarce shaped upon the twilight pale, And faintly bade Fitzharding hail. 'Twas Clement, who, with ready care, Came to enjoin him yet beware Duke Richard's scouts, on watch below, Where, he had secret cause to know, They stood to give a dagger blow To one, who yet their search had fled— Lancastrian knight—so was it said. And Clement pointed where, in guile, Those men in arms within the gloom, Who traced the Baron down the aisle, Still lingered near St. Scytha's tomb. XIV. Since, then, Fitzharding here must rest, He mournfully the Monk addressed— “Wilt thou, meanwhile, the aisles explore, And make strict search the corpses o'er? These are the signs thy search shall lead; Mark them, and then away, with speed! Tall is my father's form, but age Has bent it with a gentle sway, Drawn on his visage wrinkles sage, And strewn his locks with silver-grey. And this the fashion of the steel, That may, alas! my sire reveal: Plain, plaited steel; no inlaid gold Is graven round each clasping fold; His helmet, all of iron proof, Is golden-damasked; and aloof The leopard for his crest is known. His visor shows three bars alone; His gilded spurs have motto bossed— ‘Loyal, though Field and Hope be lost.’” XV. While thus Fitzharding, with a sigh, Pictured the warrior's pageantry, While each remembered sign he drew Gave his sire's image to his view, He paused, o'ercome with sudden dread, As if he saw his father dead. The Monk in listening silence stood, With look that spoke his mournful mood, And bent his head in meek assent, And on his solemn errand went. XVI. Fitzharding from his station viewed His friend pass slowly on the aisle, Whose steps his anxious eyes pursued, Watched every gesture, attitude, And pause, however slight, the while. The ordered biers he moved among, And o'er each corpse inquiring hung. As slowly on the forms he dwelt, Fitzharding dread impatience felt, Mingled with anger and surprise, As pauses bade new fears arise. “Oh! need he doubt? a single glance Might prove my father's countenance. Even now upon his face, perchance, He looks! Ah! now he seeks the crest, And now the shield upon his breast, And now the golden spur he spells, Still on the motto there he dwells! Would that my eyes their light could lend! Oh! will these moments never end?” He passes to a farther tomb; Fitzharding felt as saved from doom. That farther bier too distant lay To give his doubts and terrors sway; He sought to calm his troubled mind, And wait the truth, with will resigned. XVII. Though now were gone the mourner-train, One weeping form appeared again. A figure, wrapt in pilgrim fold, Passed as with desperation bold; On as she stept, went close beside, A Monk, as guardian and as guide. She glanced on every warrior's face; And, though she passed with frantic pace, Yet was there in her gesture grace, That gave to sorrow dignity, And drew and fixed Fitzharding's eye. He sighed to think, that frame so slight Must meet affliction's rudest blight; That sensibility so keen Had dared to rush upon this scene, Where nerves, that had sustained the fight, Shuddered and shrunk, and shunned the sight. “She seeks, perchance, a husband slain; If found—how may her heart sustain The dreadful truth?” 'Twas thus he said, “How may she view her husband dead?” XVIII. Struck with a solemn sympathy, He groaned, and watched what she might see: A softer pity touched his breast From contrast, as this stranger's woes, And Florence in her home of rest, Upon his fancy rose. He thought what her state might have been, Had she been doomed to this dread scene, And blessed her in repose. Her fears must all aside be cast, If safe his messenger had passed. XIX. Some likeness in their grace and air, On Florence still detained his thought, And, as he marked the stranger's care, A deeper pity for her wrought. She bent upon St. Scytha's tomb, That lay beneath Fitzharding's eye, Viewed the dead warrior through the gloom, And, reading respite of her doom, She looked, in thankfulness, on high:— And, as the light beamed o'er her face, The Baron could her features trace. Upon his mind, like sudden spell, Terror and consternation dwell! 'Tis Florence! 'tis herself! his own Venturing among the dead alone. XX. Short was the spell, that fixed him here: Forgotten every danger near, Save those, that might her steps await: Forgotten even his threatened fate, He rushes on the aisle below, And clasps that pilgrim form of woe. His voice recalls her fleeting sense; She lifts her eyes, but sight is gone! Her trembling lips, that would dispense Affection, comfort, joy alone, Murmur but with a feeble moan. Fitzharding called aloud for aid, And would have borne her from this shade Through every danger of the way, Even where the watchful foeman may Seize on him for his instant prey. XXI. The monk attendant, late her guide, Warned him of ill, that must betide From Richard's bands, these walls between, If there Lancastrian were seen. Then to the cloister straight he hied, And soon his ready zeal supplied Such aid as twice recalled her life, From joy and sorrow's various strife. 'Twas he, who found her senseless laid, Long since, when she a form surveyed, And, having raised the veil of death, Had caught the ghastly glimpse beneath, Which brought to her half-wildered mind The very form she feared to find. XXII. Grief may be painted; 'tis of earth: But joy, which is of heavenly birth, Of spirit all—celestial fire— May not be known, May not be shown, Save in the smile its beams inspire. Such smile spoke thoughts denied to breath; Such smile on Florence' lips was seen; It lightened o'er this world of death, And with its glory veiled the scene! She saw alone her husband saved! Horror and grief had vanished now; Present and future ill she braved, Might but her steps with his steps go. She viewed not shape stand watching by, With curious and with cruel eye. XXIII. How different was Fitzharding's state! No joy beamed on his anxious mind; But terrors for his father's fate, With fears for Florence now combined. Even at that moment, suddenly, Might he his father's image see Stretched on some marble near! Ere Florence might be spared such sight, Or shrouded from Duke Richard's might, How might he seek the bier? XXIV. To save her from this scene of dread And chance of various ill, The cloister gallery he had fled Seemed place of refuge still. But her sole fear on this sad ground, Was loss of him so lately found. Prophetic seemed it to her heart— If now they part—they ever part! All other danger, light as air, Claimed not with her a single care. Sure of his life, her peace was sure; What need of safe retreat for her? 'Twas not in shrouding solitude; Far distant woe might there intrude. 'Twas even at her husband's side, That safety was—whate'er betide; For, come the worst, they share it all, Together live—together fall. XXV. Fitzharding thought not thus:—He dared Meet woe alone—not woe thus shared. But, dreading now again to part, His judgment yielded to his heart; He caught the courage of her love; What she feared not he thought not of. Then, while he bade, with tender care, Florence for dismal sights prepare, Her only answers were a sigh And smile of sadness soon passed by. She drew the dark hood o'er her head, And followed closely where he led. END OF VOL. III. CANTO X. AMONG THE DEAD. I. With even step and shaded eye Florence the tombs now passes by. While near the choir Fitzharding drew, Pausing, he points out to her view Where the three noble warriors lie, With high and solemn obsequy Of torches fixed and priestly ward, And incense-cloud and herald-guard. II. By the first bier he took his stand, And looked on great Northumberland, Kinsman of Hotspur—him, who died Fighting against the new-grown pride Of Bolingbroke, whose wiles and might Usurped the second Richard's right; Kinsman of him, who blazed the deed Of Richard's death in Pomfret tower, Defying the usurper's power. And now had Hotspur's kinsman died, Fighting on that usurper's side; Yet for a meek and blameless king, To whom his unsought honours bring The curse of his progenitor, Disputed right and civil war. III. Dashing aside a soldier's tear, Fitzharding reached the centre bier; Portcullis yet was watchful here. He looked on his commander's face, And thought within how short a space He had himself obeyed his voice, Soon as the battle-hour began, Flattered and honoured, by his choice, With post of danger in the van. Then every limb with life was warm; Now heavy death pressed all his form, Its sullen gloom hung on his brow, And tinged the half-closed lid below, Dwelt in the hollow of his cheek, And seemed, with breathless sign, to speak Of more than human tongue may dare— Of the last pang, that lingered there. IV. His dinted casque, that stood beside, Told whence had rushed the fatal tide; Its high plume, that had waved so gay Beneath St. Alban's tower this day, Mantling like snowy swan, and danced To every step his charger pranced; As jocund at the trumpet's air, And proud the pomps of war to share,— Now broken, stained, and stiff with gore Fell, as in horrors, bristled o'er. The golden lions in his shield Glared on his pulseless breast; And every sign, that rank revealed And royal race professed, Seemed but to mock his rest. His honours now—the pausing eye, The people's tear, the warrior's sigh; For these alone his virtues tell:— Grandson of John o' Gaunt, farewell! V. Fitzharding, with swift step, passed on To the third bier, which stood alone; And here—oh here! the pausing eye— The sudden tear—the bursting sigh, At once De Clifford own. Oh loyal heart! oh brave old man! And hast thou closed thy mortal span, With youthful fire, exhaustless zeal For thy good king and country's weal! And, scorning age and shadowy days, Hast, with the eagle's dauntless gaze, Still soared in Glory's keenest blaze, And won a circlet of her rays!— Awhile Fitzharding bent his head, In mindful stillness, o'er the dead— Then turned upon his dreadful way, To seek if thus his father lay: While the deep thunder's mystic groan Muttered, it seemed, prophetic moan! VI. With eager eye he sought around, Through the black shades of this drear ground, And, while the lightning quivering throws It's pale glance o'er each warrior's brows, Catches each shape and look of death Extended on the graves beneath. How sudden rose each livid face From forth the shadows of the place, And, sudden sunk, was seen no more— The vision with the blue glimpse o'er! And often to his anxious view Thus rose some form in death he knew: One who had close beside him fought, While Richard's fiercest self he sought; Some who had near his father been, When in the throng he last was seen, And when from battle he in vain Had sought to join his band again. VII. On a low stone, lit up by ray Of single torch, a body lay In ringed mail; with umbered gleam Full on the face red flashes stream. Fitzharding paused awhile, and groaned, Again his eye a comrade owned; For whom high danger he had braved; Whose life, that day, he once had saved. His iron van-brace now could show The very dint of sabre blow, Aimed at the life he then preserved, Alas! for speedy fate reserved. VIII. Where spread each graven brass, beyond, Above, below, was death; Above, scarce cold, a warrior's hand, A monk's lay hid beneath, That had for ages mouldered there, Since he had left his cell of care. Such brass-sealed grave showed sculpture rude Of monk, in kneeling attitude. There lay the brave Sir Robert Vere, Whose words yet smote Fitzharding's ear, “Warwick breaks up the Barrier!” With winged speed he urged his way, Then plunged in thickest of the fray. IX. And here, among the loyal slain, Behold! Sir Richard Fortescue; There lay Sir William Chamberlain; There, Sir Ralph Ferrers, brave and true; With many a veteran knight and squire, Whose breast had flamed with patriot fire; And humbler men, whose courage high Had taught them for their prince to die. Who now shall wait at the King's gate, For, here lies faithful Chanselar? Richard Chanselar, porter to Henry VI. Who urge the steed to utmost speed, For Henry Hawlin Henry Hawlin, a messenger of “our lady, Dame Margarett.” sleepeth here? Of all the wide lands he has traced Six feet for him remain; Of all the minutes of his haste Not one to tell his pain! To other tongue he leaves to say Tiding of Alban's bloody fray; To bear unto Queen Margaret's ears The crowded tale of woes and fears— Pressed into hours the fate of years! His course, his toilful bustle done, Now lies he here—his inn is won. X. And who shall to the dais bring, With marshalled state before the King, And train of household squires, And blaze of yeul-clough fires, The boar's head, at that merry tide, When royal halls are opened wide? Not he so mute on yonder grave; The King's chief Sewer he;— Never again his chaunted stave Shall join the minstrelsy! Never again his jocund eye Shall glance where banners wave on high, And where plumed knight and ladies bright Are ranged around, in purple dight— Knights, who no more in gallant state Shall answer to the minstrel's call; Ladies, whom war and cruel fate Have banished from the lighted hall. XI. But who is he, within the shade Of Wulphstan's ancient altar laid? No funeral torch, with lurid glare, Burns o'er the iron warrior there; Nor watch-monk sits in piteous care. But twilight rays from distant tomb Just shape his outline through the gloom.— Whence is the tremour Florence feels? Why does Fitzharding grasp her arm, Silent and shaking with alarm?— He fears dread truth that bier conceals. In vain he bends upon the face, Yet seems his father's form to trace. He signed the monk, attendant still, To hasten where yon glimmers lead, For the lone torch, his fate to read. Yet, while the monk obeyed his will, He feared lest sudden lightning-glance Might show his father's countenance Sunk ghastly in the helm and drear. He turned him from such awful chance, And dimly saw, beside the bier, A form in silence resting near, In other cares so wrapped was he, He guessed not now of treachery. XII. “Oh! will these moments never fleet? Yet for this slow monk must I wait?” He made some hasty steps to meet His lingering messenger of fate; And seized the torch, with desperate hand, And took again his fearful stand. The flame glanced o'er the golden crest; And there the leopard stood confessed! The face!—he turned him from the light, Veiling his eyes from the dread sight, To meet that altered look afraid. Sudden, strong hands the torch invade, And hold it forth upon the corpse. He turned to see what stranger's force Had seized it. There, with bending head, A form looked on the warrior dead; And, as he viewed the corpse below, The torch flashed full upon his brow, And showed his quivering lip, his eye, Fixed as by some dire phantasie. Then, all his father's look was known, Reflecting terrors like his own While that dead form he gazed upon, And feared to find his slaughtered son! The living voice beside him spoke! The long-fixed spell at once was broke! XIII. But who may tell the feelings high Rising from fear to ecstasy, While sire and son each other pressed, And each in other's grasp was blessed. Their joy was as the Morning's smile, With light of heaven upon its brow, The sable wreaths of Night, the while, Frowning upon the world below, Till their dark host, in wide array, Touched with the rising beams of day, Rich tints of rose and gold display, And form, as on the sun they wait, The pomp and triumph of his state. XIV. Short triumph here. In cloud of woe Faded joy's high reflected glow— At D'Arcy's Earl was aimed the blow. Fitzharding, quick as glance of light, The poniard wrenched, with skilful might, And laid its ruffian master low. He, instant, knew the carle he viewed Was one, who late his steps pursued, And watched St. Scytha's shrine. Not with Fitzharding was his strife; His aim was at Earl D'Arcy's life; But, led by knightly sign, He traced the Baron on his way; The gilded spur upon his heel Did shrouded warrior reveal, And marked him forth for prey. But, when Fitzharding left his shade, Hastening to render Florence aid, The cowl fell back, that veiled his face, And his pursuer stayed his pace, Till, guided by strange sounds of joy, He came the father to destroy. XV. Short time had Florence to revive From terror and dismay, Support from tenderness derive, Or tender tear repay; Short time for speech had sire and son, Ere the good monk, her guide, came on. He warmly urged their instant flight; For comrades of the fallen were nigh,— Monks, too, who shelter would deny When they might view this dismal sight. He would a hidden passage show, To serve as screen from menaced woe; Till day should send Duke Richard hence, His march for London to commence, And all his myrmidons of war, Guarding their captive King afar. XVI. Briefly the Knights their thanks repaid; And looked on him, who bore their crest, All lifeless on the marble laid,— Briefly for him their grief expressed: “Richard Fitzharding—kinsman dear! On thee will fall the future tear, When thought may pause upon thy bier!” Swift on the southern aisle they went By many a dim-seen monument; And reached a little shaded door That led the great west entrance o'er; Where gallery, that ran between The crowning battlement, unseen, Received them in its silent space. Well knew the Earl this lonely place, For, even here, at curfew hour, He refuge sought from Richard's power; And here remained, till he in vain Searched for his son among the slain. XVII. Oh! if by care and grief are told The unseen steps of Time; How many hours—nay days—had rolled, Since, lingering in this secret hold, He heard that curfew chime! Since, on the northern gallery His restless steps had strayed, Where he had viewed, unconsciously, His son in monkish shade, Who there the vision of his face Amid the shadows seemed to trace. Now joy told forth the time so fast, The present moment was the past, Ere yet he marked it glide along, Stealing the tale upon his tongue. Full many an hour had D'Arcy passed, Since o'er the Norman Shade He marked the sun its low beam cast, And glow with angry red; Since he had heard St. Alban's knell Sound what had seemed his son's farewell; Since from safe nook he turned away, To seek, where death and danger lay. XVIII. Ere now withdrew the monk, their guide, He bade the warriors here abide Till morning hour, when they might hear Drums and the neigh of steeds draw near. Then, soon as Richard's hosts were gone, He would return, and lead their way To chamber, where the Abbot lay. While grateful words the Knights repay, Florence could only with a tear Thank the good priest for service dear. Time had not yet been lent to tell The acts, on which she fain would dwell: The kindness, that restored her life From grief and horror's mingled strife. Meekly he bowed his aged head, And then on soundless foot he sped. They heard him bar the gallery-door, And soon, upon the paved floor, Watched his dark shadow pass away, Where the high-tombed warriors lay. XIX. And now Fitzharding pressed to hear From Florence all her tale of fear. She told her sorrows, from the hour When first she watched St. Alban's tower; Of her dark path of dread and grief Through forest shade; of pilgrim train, And words exchanged; of wounded chief, She feared had been Fitzharding slain. Told of her courser's sudden flight Through ruffian-troops fresh from the fight, His strength, his courage and his speed, His dexterous course at utmost need; Till, at St. Alban's warded gate, Though courage, skill, nor strength abate, They seized him as a prize of war, And Florence for their prisoner. But, ere they led her to close ward, Her proffered gold to one on guard Aided her through the barrier, (Enfolded in her pilgrim-shroud) Among an anxious, hurrying crowd, Seeking their friends within the town. Words might not tell what she had known, While, by the dying and the dead, She passed to gain this Abbey's shade; Nor, when she sunk, beside the bier Of warrior, laid in chamber near. XX. 'Twere vain to tell Fitzharding's pain, While listening to the fearful strain; How oft he shuddered, oft reproved, And blamed her most, when most he loved, For courage rash, for passage won, And high exploits for his sake done. Scarce might the Earl his wonder speak, That one so gentle and so weak The meed of heroes thus might claim: But greater fear the less o'ercame. Then Sire and Son to other tell What each in yester fight befell; Of nobles slain, and friends that failed At utmost need, though horsed and mailed. But chief their indignation rose 'Gainst Wentworth—traitor to his king, Whose standard basely did he fling To ground, and fled before his foes! XXI. Earl D'Arcy then the story told Of many a fugitive he met, Wounded and lorn, both young and old, Seeking a home ere sun was set. In a close wood near Alban's town, Laid in a wretched cart, alone, Sore wounded Dorset, he, with pain, Saw journeying to his domain— Him must he never see again! Stafford's brave Earl on litter borne, Whose hand by fatal shaft was torn, Already on his look was laid Approaching Death's first warning shade. His gallant father, too, was near, Who to his tomb the scar would bear Received this day for Lancaster; Through vizor closed the arrow sped, That sent him from his steed as dead, And nearly had the life-blood quaffed: Yet fatal was not deemed the shaft. Ah! deeply must the shaft of sorrow Strike to his heart, when, on the morrow, He o'er his only son shall stand, And feel the death-dew on his hand! XXII. As this sad image rose to view, Earl D'Arcy, as in sympathy, Gazed on his son, whose living hue Awoke his grateful fervency. A silent tear stood in his eye, As passed his offered thanks on high. Well read the son his father's care; Rejoiced he in those thanks to share. But hark! a low and measured chime Speaks from the tower the Watch of Prime, Sounding due summons to the knights For some high pomp of funeral rites. O'er that west gallery might they bend And trace nave, choir, from end to end. The lofty vista, crowned with shade, On pillars vast was reared, Where pointed arch, in far arcade, Mixed with rude Saxon was displayed, And double tiers above arrayed, By superstition feared. Broad rose the Norman arch on high, That propped the central tower, And forward led the wondering eye O'er the choir roof's bright canopy, To the east window's bower. XXIII. How solemn swept before their sight This Abbey's inner gloom, Thwarted with gleams of streaming light And shade from pier and tomb, Flung by lone torch, or by the ray Of tapers, sickening at the day. For now, the thunder-clouds o'erpast, May's crystal morn its dawning cast On every window's untraced pane, And touched it with a cold, blue stain. How peaceful dawned that living light O'er eyes for ever set in night! O'er eyes, that, but on yesterday, Viewed distant years in long array, And lovely gleams of shaded joy Upon their evening landscape lie. XXIV. In solemn thought, while Sire and Son Beheld the fate of friends below, Their hearts a various feeling own, That, saved from every mortal blow, For them another morning rose, And brought their wearied limbs repose! Then Pity shed a tender tear For many a warrior sleeping here. And thus, at the first dawn of day, Their duteous orisons they pay. The grateful thoughts ascend on high, Like May's first offerings, to the sky, That sweet and still and full arise 'Mid silent dews and peaceful sighs; Even as the glad lark's soaring trill, Heard, when the thunder's voice is still, Rejoicing in the breath of May:— But, oh! that sweet and jocund lay Now yields to other sounds, and dread— To bell that mourns the slaughtered dead! XXV. But see! a sudden radiance streams From Alban's choir and shrined tomb; The sable veil withdrawn, the beams, Just kindling, break upon the gloom, From torch and taper lifted there, 'Mid burnished gold and image fair. While through the choir the shrine-lights spread, Gleamed each tall column's branching head, Circled with golden blazonry— The shielded arms of abbots dead. These shields, so small and close, like gems Enclasped the columns' clustered stems, That rose in the ribbed arch on high, And spread, in fan-like tracery, Upon the choir's long canopy; Where visioned angels shed their light Upon a vault of mimic night. XXVI. And now the long perspective line Extending through those arches three, Of stately grace, above the shrine, St. Mary's Chapel they might see, Distinct, yet stealing from the sight; And high, beyond the altar there, Her image, shrined in flowers fair, Lessened afar in softer light, While, miniatured, before it glide Her priests, who chaunt at morning-tide. Again that bell, with solemn tongue, Through vault and aisle and gallery rung; Till distant voices, drawing near, Fell, deeply murmuring, on the ear. This was the Requiem-mass of Prime, The Requiem, sung with honours due, Of torch and incense, dirge and chime, When the whole convent, two and two, And the Lord Abbot stately led, In flowing vest, with mitred head— 'Twas the full mass for princes said, When they repose among the dead. XXVII. 'Twas then the aged Abbot came, Obedient to the Monarch's claim. Beneath the cloister's westward arch, By the great porch, he held his march, With all the officers of state, That on the Abbey's greatness wait. Of humbler servants twenty-one, Bearing before him each a torch, Light the high-sweeping Norman porch With dusky glare, like setting sun, When yester battle-day was done. Then paced his monks in double row, Bearing their hundred tapers, slow, That beamed upon each bannered saint And pageant blazoned high and quaint. The Abbot came with ready zeal, Though called from short and needful rest, And with pale age and grief oppressed, To give the Requiem's solemn seal And passport to a quiet grave; And weep the tear due to the brave. XXVIII. A tear! does Glory claim a tear? Weeps he upon a Hero's bier? The maid, as in the tomb she fades; The youth, once 'tranced in Fancy's shades; The wedded pair, whose hearts are one, Who lived each other's world alone; The infant, that had smiled so fair, Like cherub, on its mother's care; The long-loved parent, sinking slow Beneath the weight of winter's snow— O'er these, when in the grave they lie, May fall the tears from Pity's eye; But o'er the warrior's tomb should glance The lightning of a poet's trance. Cold was the reverend Father's mind, By wisdom, or by age, refined To simple truth, that scorns the prize, For which the bard, the hero, dies— A shade, a sound, a pageant gay, A morning cloud of golden May, Glorious with beams of orient hue, That, while they flatter—melt it too! And, for such airy charm, he gives The real world, in which he lives; And, gazing on the lofty show, Sinks in the closing tomb below!— And therefore fell the Abbot's tear O'er Glory and a Hero's bier. XXIX. While these last rites, from Pity due, The Abbot gave, you still might view In his raised eye, the noble mind That suffered much, yet shone resigned:— Calm and unbreathing was his look, As though of all, save soul, forsook; And all his form and air conveyed The aspect of some peaceful shade, Contented tenant of a cell, Who long had bade the world farewell. Still, as he moved, the verse was sung For crowds of dead they passed among; And still the gliding tapers threw A fleeting, gloomy, livid hue On every face, on every grave, Ranged on each side the long wide nave. Though slaughtered men his pathway bound, He shrunk not from this dreadful ground. XXX. Now, where around dead Somerset High pomp of funeral-watch was met, Where o'er his corpse twelve torches blazed, Circle of light, by almsmen raised, And choristers beyond attend; There, slow the Abbey-train ascend, And, ranged in triple crescent-rows, Step above step, the fathers bend, While requiem and blessed repose Are sung, with long-resounding breath, For all in battle slain, beneath. How high and full the organs swell, And roll along the distant aisle, Till, dying on the ear, they fell, And every earthly thought beguile. While finely stole the softened strain, And stately moved the solemn march, The Knights and Florence view with pain The scene beneath the Norman arch. Soon as the chaunted hymn was o'er, Portcullis, on the steps before, Cried out with lofty voice of dole, “Say for the soul—say for the soul Of Somerset, high duke and prince, And for each soul departed since The onset of the battle-fray, The wonted Requiem:—sing and say!” XXXI. It was an awful thrilling sight, Beneath this Abbey's far-drawn flight, To view her dark-robed sons arranged, In memory of those thus changed, Now seen in death laid out below, Even while the Requiem's tender woe Did for each parted spirit flow. And first was seen a mourner pace, His mantle borne with stately grace, His eyes veiled in his hood, Bearing the princely offering Of Henry, his sad lord and king, Where high the Abbot stood— The sword of Somerset he bore: A herald stalked, with casque, before. He stopped below the Abbot's feet, With low-bowed head and gesture meet. Each pious gift the Father took With meekest grace and downward eye; And gave it to his Prior nigh, Who held it, with a reverend look, At the bier's head on high. XXXII. A second mourner pacing grave, Attended by a herald-band, For the mass-penny offering gave An offering for Northumberland. No pomp appeared, when he bent down, Of cushion, or of carpeting; Such stately signs were given alone To greet the Sovereign's offering. Last, for De Clifford offering came; And when the herald called his name, The Abbot, gazing on his bier, Gave bitter offering of a tear! And dignified the warrior's grave, With Virtue's tribute to the brave! Nearer the aged Father drew, Where the chief mourners wait, And sprinkled there the drops held due To Somerset's sad state. These valued rites alike he paid To Percy's and De Clifford's shade, And then, with supplicating eye, Stretched forth his hands upon the air, As if he would a blessing sigh On all the dead and living there. XXXIII. As sunk the service for the dead, Deep sighs of grief and mournful dread, Of pious gratitude and love, In Florence' gentle bosom strove; While on his arm she bowed her head, For whom her thankful tears were shed. The Knights had watched the sad array, Till now the rising beams of May Paled even the torches' yellow flame; And on the vault high overhead, And on the far perspective, came A purer light, a softer shade, Harmonious, and of deep repose, Sweet as the Requiem's dying close! When, sudden, on this calm profound The war-trump sent its brazen sound. XXXIV. Fiercely, though far without the wall, They heard Duke Richard's trumpet call The morning-watch, at rising sun. Then other startling sounds begun, Voices and drums and trampling hoofs, In preparation of their way To London with the King this day. And thus, while all beneath these roofs Were hushed by hopes Religion lent, The brazen shriek of War's fell brood Even to the sepulchre pursued The victims she had thither sent. Profaning, with a ruthless tongue, The holy anthem scarcely sung. XXXV. Soon as the Requiem was said, The Abbot sought the captive King; To mourn with him his warriors dead, And his last sorrowing farewell bring. In contemplation deep, and grief, Meek Henry watched alone, Seeking his only sure relief Before the Highest Throne. Soon as the Sire drew near, and told Names of th' unburied dead, King Henry felt a withering cold O'er all his senses spread:— Scarce could he thank him for the rite He had performed this dreadful night; For pious courage, that pursued And that the Victor had subdued, So far as grant of sepulchre For those, who thanks could ne'er prefer— He would have said,—but utterance failed To speak for those he now bewailed. XXXVI. Yet did he praise the fortitude That Richard's cruel claims withstood, And held the rights of sanctuary For friends o'ercome by misery. Then for himself he thanked him last, For hospitable duty past; For sympathies of look and tone While he had been a captive guest; Such as the broken spirits own, And treasure in the grateful breast. He willed an Anniversary Should of the fatal yesterday Be held within this choir, for those, Whose bodies here find just repose. He had no treasures left to prove How much this place deserved his love; But with meek look he asked, and voice, The Abbot would a gift receive, His only gift—he had no choice— The offering would his heart relieve— Certain rich robes which once he wore, Fit clothing these for him no more! Haply such robes might now aspire To Abbey-use;—he would desire That, for his own sake, there should be A day of Anniversary, To mark the memory of a friend— The day when his poor life should end. XXXVII. The Abbot bent; and bowed his head To hide the tears that dimmed his eye; Faltered the words he would have said— Of reverence, love, and grief—and fled In deep convulsive sigh. Oh! had he viewed in future time The vision of that ghastly crime (Pointing the pathway to the tomb) Which marked the day of Henry's doom, His aged heart at once had failed, And he had died, while he bewailed. Henry one moment o'er him hung, With look more eloquent than tongue— Brief moment of emotion sweet! Ere the King raised him from his feet: But hark! in Abbey-court there rung Flourish of trumpets, cheers of crowd, Shrill steeds and drums all roaring loud. XXXVIII. The Abbot rose, but trembled, too; Yet calm his look of ashy hue. He sighed, but spoke not. Steps are heard; A page and knight approach the King; Message from Richard straight they bring, That all things wait the royal word For London; and the morning wore. Faint smile of scorn the King's face bore At mockery of his princely will, While captive he to Richard still. But the meek Henry was not born To feel, or give, the sting of scorn; Soon did that smile in sadness fade, Tinged soft with resignation's shade— The paleness of a weeping moon, Which clouds and vapours rest upon. XXXIX. Again the trumpets bray; again Ring iron steps, and shouts of men. In armour cased, Duke Richard came; Proudly his warlike form he held, And looked the Spirit of the field, Yet for King Henry's royal name Feigned reverence due. With gentle blame For lingering thus, he urged him hence, While mingled o'er his countenance A milder feeling with his pride— A pity he had fain denied— As he that look of goodness viewed, Beaming in dignity subdued. XL. Following his steps came knight and lord, And filled the royal chamber broad; Yet came not Warwick in the throng, Smitten with consciousness of wrong. There was in Henry's meekened look A silent but a deep rebuke, That smote his heart, and almost drew His vast ambition from its view. But, when that look was seen no more, The pang it caused too soon was o'er, And rashly his career he held 'Gainst him in council and in field; And now was with the vanguard gone To fix the triumph he had won. XLI. By the King's side, mourning his fate, The aged Abbot stept. Through chamber, passage, hall, and gate, Where steeds and squires and lancemen wait, The Abbey's pomp, the Warrior's Their full appointment kept. When the last portal they had gained, Close marshalled bands without were trained; Within, high state the Church maintained. The Abbot paused, and from his brow Dismissed the darker cloud of woe, To bless his parting Lord; With arms outstretched, and look serene, Pity and reverence were seen A farewell to afford. And thus the hundred monks around Bestowed their blessings on his head, While none of all the crowd was found, Rude foes, stern soldiers, marshalled, That did not say, or seem to say, “Blessings attend thee on thy way!” XLII. The farewell Benediction o'er, Duke Richard willed such scene no more, And instant signal made to part; He scorned, yet feared, each trait of heart. A smile, a tear, in Henry's eye Said more than words may e'er supply, As from the portal slow he past And turned a long look—and the last. Loud blew the trumpets, as in scorn Of those they left behind Stretched pale upon these aisles forlorn; Loud blew they in the wind. The fierce yet melancholy call, Which died around each sable pall, Formed but the warrior's wonted knell— The solemn and the last farewell! XLIII. This fearful summons was the last That shook the sainted Alban's shrine; While now the martial pageant past, Arrayed in many a glittering line, From his pale choir and frowning tower, Sad witness of the battle hour. And from that broad tower now was seen Those bands of war, on May's first green, In gleaming pomp and long array Winding by meads and woods away; While Clement viewed them, who, with dread, Had watched their fires on hill outspread; Had seen their white tents, dawning slow On yester-morning's crimsoned brow; And thought how soon his shrines might fall Beneath this poorly-battled wall. He heard their trumpets in the gale Sink fainter; as they seemed to wail That Quiet did o'er War prevail. He heard the tramp of measured tread, The clattering hoofs, that forward sped; The numerous voice in sullen hum; And, last and lone, the hollow drum, Till far its deadened beat decayed, And fell upon the listening ear Soft as the drop through leafy shade, Then trembled into very air. How still the following pause and sweet, While yet the air-pulse seemed to beat! XLIV. Thus passed the warlike vision by; While Alban's turrets, peering high Upon the gold and purpled sky, O'erlooked the way for many a mile, And, touched with May-beams, seemed to smile, —Smile on the flight of War's sad care, That left them to their sleep in air; And left the monks of gentle deed, To blessed thanks from those they speed— Left the poor friend, who watched his lord Wounded, unwitting of reward, To see him to his home restored— The saintly Abbot left to close His gathered years in due repose— The dead unto their honoured tombs; To peace these aisle's and transept's glooms! XLV. When Florence to her home returned The aged servant she had mourned Received her at her gate; And, pawing on the ground again, Behold her steed, who prison-rein Had snapped, and homeward fled amain, And here did watchful wait; And onward to his mistress went, With playing pace and neck low bent. Once more beneath her peaceful bower, Oh! how may words her feelings tell, While now she viewed St. Alban's tower, That, yesterday, even at this hour, She watched beneath dark Terror's power?— One other day had broke his spell! XLVI. Farewell! farewell! thou Norman Shade! The waning Moon slants o'er thy head; Thy humbler turrets, seen below, Uplift the darkly-silvered brow, And point where the broad transepts sweep, Measuring thy grandeur; while they keep In silent state thy watch of night, Communing with each planet bright; And sad and reverendly they stand Beneath thy look of high command. Oh! Shade of ages long gone past, Though sunk their tumult like the blast, Still steals its murmur on my ear; And, once again, before mine eye, The long-forgotten scenes sweep by; Called from their trance, though hearsed in Time, Bursting their shroud, thy forms appear, With darkened step and front sublime, Sadness, that weeps not—strength severe. And still, in solemn ecstasy, I hear afar thy Requiem die; Voices harmonious through thy roofs aspire, The high-souled organ breathes a seraph's fire! Peace be with all beneath thy presence laid: Peace and farewell!—farewell, thou Norman Shade! END OF ST. ALBAN'S ABBEY. MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. SALISBURY PLAINS. STONEHENGE. I. Whose were the hands, that upheaved these stones Standing, like spectres, under the moon, Steadfast and solemn and strange and alone, As raised by a Wizard—a king of bones! And whose was the mind, that willed them reign, The wonder of ages, simply sublime? The purpose is lost in the midnight of time; And shadowy guessings alone remain. II. Yet a tale is told of these vast plains, Which thus the mysterious truth explains: 'Tis set forth in a secret legend old, Whose leaves none living did e'er unfold. Quaint is the measure, and hard to follow, Yet sometimes it flies, like the circling swallow. III. Near unto the western strand, Lies a tract of sullen land, Spreading 'neath the setting light, Spreading, miles and miles around, Which for ages still has frowned: Be the sun all wintry white, Or glowing in his summer ray, Comes he with morning smile so bright, Or sinks in evening peace away, Yet still that land shows no delight! IV. There no forest leaves are seen, Yellow corn, nor meadow green, Glancing casement, grey-mossed roof, Rain and hail and tempest proof; Nor, peering o'er that dreary ground, Is spied along the horizon's bound The distant vane of village spire, Nor far-off smoke from lone inn fire, Where weary traveller might rest With blazing hearth and brown ale blest, Potent the long night to beguile, While loud without raves the bleak wind; No: his dark way he there must shivering find; No signs of rest upon the wide waste smile. V. But the land lies in grievous sweep Of hills not lofty, vales not deep, Or endless plains where the traveller fears No human voice shall reach his ears; Where faintest peal of unknown bells Never along the lone gale swells; Till, folding his flock, some shepherd appear, And Salisbury steeple it's crest uprear; But that's o'er miles yet many to tell, O'er many a hollow, many a swell; And that shepherd sees it, now here now there, Like a Will o'-the wisp in the evening air, As his way winds over each hill and dell, Where once the ban of the Wizard fell! VI. Would you know why this country so desolate lies? Why no sound but the tempest's is heard, as it flies, Or the croak of the raven, or bustard's cries? Why the corn does not spring nor a cottage rise? Why no village-Church is here to raise The blest hymn of humble heart-felt praise, Nor ring for the passing soul a knell, Nor give to the dead a hallowed cell, Nor in wedlock-bonds unite a pair, Nor sound one merry peal through the air? All this and much more would you know? And why, And how, Salisbury spire was built so high, As fairies had meant it to prop the sky? Then listen and watch, and you soon shall hear What never till now hath met mortal ear! VII. It was far, far back in the dusky time, Before Church-bells had learnt to chime, That a Sorcerer ruled these gloomy lands Far as old Ocean's southern sands. He lived under oaks of a thousand years, Where now not the root of an oak appears! On each high bough a dark fiend dwelt, Ready to go, when his name was spelt, Down, down to the caves where the Earthquake slept, Or up to the clouds, where the whirlwind swept. VIII. The Sorcerer never knew joy, or peace, For still with his power did pride increase. He could ride on a wolf from the North to South, With a bridle of serpents held fast by the mouth; And he minded no more the glare of his eyes, That flashed about as the lightning flies, Than the red darting tongue of the snake, that coil'd Round his bridling hand, and for liberty toil'd. He could sail on the clouds from East to West, He rested not, he! nor let others rest; And evil he wrought, wherever he went, For, he worked, with Hela's and Loke's consent. The branch of spectres she gave for his wand, And nine hundred imps were at his command! He could call up a storm from the vast sea-wave, And, when ships were wrecked, not a man would he save! He could call a thunder-bolt down from a cloud, And wrap a whole town in a fiery shroud! IX. He could chase a ghost down the road of the dead, Through valleys of darkness, by snakes' eyes shown, And pass o'er the bridge, that to Hela led, Where afar off was heard the wolf Fenris' groan, While it guarded her halls of pain and grief, Where she nursed her children—Famine and Fear; He could follow a spectre, even here, With the dauntless eye of a Wizard-chief. He could chase a ghost down the road of the dead, Till it passed the halls of Hela the dread. He could chase a ghost down the road of the dead, Till it came where the northern lights flash red. Then the ghost would vanish amid their glow, But the Wizard's bold steps could no farther go! And whether those lights were weal, or woe, The Sorcerer's self might never know. All this and more he full often had done, And changed to an ice-ball the flaming Sun! X. Now Odin had watched from his halls of light This dark Wizard's fell and increasing might; And clearly he knew, that his craft he drew Hela.From the Witch of Death and the Evil Sprite, Loke. Who, though chain'd in darkness, and far below, Sent his shadows on earth, to work it woe. This Wizard had even defied his power, For once, in the dim and lonely hour, When Odin had seen him riding the air, And bid him with his bright glance forbear, Great Odin's look he would not obey, But went, on his cloud, his evil way! He had dared to usurp, when invoking a storm, The likeness of Odin's shadowy form, And, when Odin sang his famed song of Peace, That hushes and bids the wild winds cease, Odin boasts of possessing such a song. Had Milton seen the boast of it in the Edda, when he wrote?— “He, with his soft pipe and smooth-dittied song, Well knew to still the wild waves, when they roar, And hush the waving woods.” While it died the sleepy woods among, And the moon-light vale had owned the song, The Wizard called back the stormy gust, O'er the spell-struck vale, and bade it burst! The woods their murmuring branches tossed, And the song—the song of Peace—was lost— Then Odin heard the groan of thrilling Fear Ascend from all the region, far and near, And, as it slowly gained upon the skies, He heard the solemn call of Pity rise! XI. Then Odin swore, By the hour that is no more! By the twilight hour to come! By the darkness of the tomb! By the flying warrior's doom! Then Odin swore, By the storm-light's lurid glare! By the shape, that watches there! By the battle's deadly field! The shield of Odin was said to be white as snow.By his terrible sword and snow-white shield, The Sorcerer's might to his might should yield. XII. While Odin spoke, the clouds were furled, And those beneath, as stories say, Lost the sight Of our earthly light, And caught a glimpse above the world! But the phantasma did not stay: It passed in the growing gloom away! And from that hour these stories date The fateful strife we now relate. XIII. Now, there was a Hermit, an ancient man, Who oft lay deep in solemn trance, Watching bright dreams of bliss advance; And marvellous things of him there ran; He had lived almost since the world began! The people feared him, day and night, And loved him, too, for they knew that he Abhorred their wizard-enemy, And wished and hoped to do them right. He owned the spell of Minstrelsy! And in the hour of deepest shade, When he would seek his forest-glade, (It was of grey oaks in a gloomy hollow Where never footsteps dared to follow,) And called from his harp a certain sound, Pale shadows would stand in his presence 'round! How this could be known, without a spell, I must briefly own I never could tell. —But, be that as it may—on that note's swell, Whether they sleeping were in halls of light, Or followed the stars down the deeps of night, Or watched the wounded Warrior's mortal sigh, Or after some ill-doing Sprite did fly, On that note's swell they to the Hermit hie; And heed his questions, wait on his command; These were the Spirits white of Odin's band. XIV. Odin had marked this renowned old Seer, And to him, at times, his favour lent; He was the first of the Druids here; And did all their laws and rites invent. Some stories say a Druid never bent At Odin's shrine; and others may have told The self-same tale, that here for truth I hold; He was the first of all the Druid race: Owning the spell serene of Minstrelsy! But though he oft the Runic rhyme did trace, No wizard he! No fiend he called, no fiend he served, And never had from justice swerved. From mystic learning came his power, His name was from his oaken-bower, He was the first of all the Druid race! XV. And Odin had marked this renowned old Seer, And, when the solemn call for pity rose, This goodly man to do his bidding chose, A sage like whom was found not far or near: Upon his head the snows of ages lay, Hung o'er his glowing eyes and waving beard, Touched every wrinkle with a paler grey, And made him marvelled at, and shunned, and feared; Yet, with this awe, love, as I said, appeared. XVI. He was gone to his home of oak; Starlight 'twas and midnight nigh; Not one wistful word he spoke, But his magic harp strung high; As he touched the calling string, Hear it through the branches ring, Till on lower clouds it broke. Straight in his bower dim shapes were seen By the fitful light, that rose within, And reddened the dark boughs above, And chequered all the shadowy grove, And tinged his robe and his beard of snow, And waked in his eyes their early glow! While, as alternate rose and sunk the gleam, The tree itself a bower or cave would seem! XVII. The Druid, wrapt in silence, lay; No need of words; his thoughts were known; “Odin has heard his people's groan,” Spoke a loud voice and passed away. Another rose, of milder tone! “The mighty task is now thine own, To free the land from wizard-guile; If thou hast wisdom to obey, And courage to fulfil the toil, Odin, for ages, to thy sway Gives each long plain and every sloping dell, Now suffering by the sinful Sorcerer's spell.” XVIII. A third voice spoke, and thus it said— “Listen and watch! for thou must brave The wily Wizard's inmost cave; And, while he sleeps, around his head Bind a charm, that shall help thee draw Each fang from his enormous jaw; There lies the force of all his spells. Hundred and forty teeth are there In triple rows; his art they share. Hundred and forty thou must draw, From upper and from under jaw. Quick must thou be; for, if the charm Break, and his bond of sleep is o'er, Ere yet thy task is done, no power Can save thee from his vengeful arm. Thence from his cave, at magic's hour, Speed thou; and close beneath his bower Bury the fangs nine fathom deep, Or ere thine eyelids close in sleep: With them his guile for ever laid, Thine is the land, which late he swayed.” XIX. The voice is passed, and once more stillness reigns: The Druid's trance is o'er; yet he retains A wildered and a haggard look, As pondering still the urgent word, And wonderous call he just had heard. And sure instruction from that call he took! XX. And from this hour he was not seen, Neither on hill, nor yet in dale; By the brown heath, nor forest green, Nor by the rills, where waters wail; By sun-light, nor by moonbeam pale. But his shape was seen, by star-light sheen; Or so the carle dreamt, who thus told the tale! XXI. For many a night and many a day, Close within his bower he lay, For many a day and many a night, Hid from sight, and hid from light, Trying the force of his mystic might; Working the charm should shield him from harm, When he in the Wizard's cave should be, To set the wretched country free. He owned the spell of Minstrelsy. XXII. It boots not that I here should say What arts the Druid did essay: How with the misletoe he wrought, That twined upon his oldest oak, How midnight dew he careful caught From nightshade, nor the words he spoke, When he mixed the charm with a moonbeam cold, To form a web, that should fast enfold The Sorcerer's eyes—vast Warwolf the bold. Nor boots it, that I here should say The dangers and changes, that him befell On his murky course to Warwolf's cell;— For, circled safe with many a subtle charm, Was his dark path along the forest-way; The lamp he bore sent forth its little ray, And sometimes showed around strange shapes of harm Gliding beneath the trees, now close beside; Now distant they would stand, obscurely seen Among the old oaks' deep-withdrawing green. XXIII. But the calm Druid touched th' according string Of the small harp he bore, with skill so true That straight they left their shape and faithless hue! Then voices strange would in the tempest sing, Calling along the wind, now loud, now low, And now, far off, would into silence go: Seeming the very fiends of wail and woe! Again th' enchanting chord the Druid woke, ('Twas as the seraph Peace herself had spoke,) And hushed to silence every wizard-foe. XXIV. The story could unfold much more, That the daring wanderer bore, O'er valley and rock and starless wood, Ere at the Sorcerer's cave he stood. There come, he paused; for even he, I ween, Confessed the secret horrors of the scene. A place like this in all the spreading bound Of these low plains can nowhere now be found. And scarcely will it be, I fear, believed That beetling cliffs did ever rear the head O'er lands as wavy now as ocean's bed. But these huge rocks on rocks by might extinct were heaved. XXV. It was where the high trees withdrew their boughs, And let the midnight-moon behold the scene, That hoary cliffs unlocked their marble jaws, And showed a melancholy cave between, With deadly nightshade hung and aconite, And every plant and shrub, that worketh spite; Upon their shuddering leaves the moonlight fell But left no silver tinges there to tell The winning power of simple Beauty's spell; Nor touched the rocks, that hung in air, With glimpse of lustre, passing fair; A dull and dismal tinge it shed, Such as might gleam on buried dead! And led, as with a harbingering ray, The Druid's steps, where the grim Wizard lay. XXVI. It led his steps; but he, in silent thought, Stood long before th' expected cave; For he beheld what none could brave, Who had not yet with magic weapon fought; He stood, the unknown cave before; High shot the little flame he bore, Then sunk as low, then spired again, And gleamed throughout the Warwolf's den; It glanced on the harp at the Druid's breast; It brightened the folds of his gathered vest! And chased the shade, that hung o'er his brow, Bound with the sacred misletoe; It silvered the snow of his wavy beard, It showed the strong lines of age and care, But the lines of Virtue mingled there, And wisdom benignant, yet stern, appeared. XXVII. Long before that cave he stood, For, hovering near, Dark shapes of fear Among the nightshade seemed to brood, And watchful eyes, between the leaves, Now here, now there, portentous glare, Direful to him, who fears and grieves, As meteors fly Through a troubled sky, When the autumn thunder-storm is near. XXVIII. And thrice he turned him to the east, And sprinkled the juice of the misletoe; And thrice he turned him to the east, And the flame he bore then changed it's glow; And thrice he turned him to the east, And the flame he bore burned high, burned low. Then a solemn strain from his harp arose; 'Mong the leaves the watching eyes 'gan close; One by one, they were closed in night, Till sunk in sleep was the Wizard's might. For, by his art, the Druid knew, That Warwolf, though he lay unseen, His deepest, darkest cave within, Closed his eyes, when these eyes closed, And now in death-like swoon reposed. And the Druid knew, that hitherto The spell of Minstrelsy was true But the Druid knew, that he must rue, If the magic sound of his harping ceased Ere his terrible task was fully done; For Warwolf would wake, and, from spell released, Call from their slumber the fiends it had won. XXIX. The Druid knew this; and he knew moreo'er, That, the moment he trod in the Wizard's den, Other fiends would spring from their sleep within, To clamour and curse, with a horrible din, If he left not his harp at the cave's door; If he left it there, and the winds should deign To call out it's sweet and magic strain, The strain of his harp would with theirs contend; And if theirs were baffled, his toil would end; If their's should triumph, his life was o'er Yet he left his harp at the cavern door; But he traced a just circle where it hung, And high in an oak's green branches swung. XXX. As now the Druid took his way In the untried cave, where the Wizard lay, Often he lingered and listened oft, Still the distant harp was swelling soft; And he paced up the cave, without dismay, Under scowling rocks, between shaggy walls, Where the gleam of his lamp, as it faintly falls, Shows a frowning face, or a beckoning hand, Or a gliding foot, or the glance of a wand. Yet oft at a distance he sweetly hears The joy of his harp, and he nothing fears, Till he comes, where a light now flashed and fled, Which darted, he knew, from the Wizard's bed. There opened the wall to a lofty hall, And he viewed what must mortal heart appal. XXXI. Outstretched and grim on his stony bed, All ghastly-pale, like a giant dead, With eyes half closed the Wizard lay, His half-shut mouth his fangs display. The skin of a dragon unscaled was his shroud; A rock was his bier; his watcher was Fear, And the winds were his mourners shrill and loud, And the caverns groaned their echoes severe. At his couch's foot lay a wolf at length, But harmless in sleep was his sinewy strength, 'Twas the wolf he had ridden from north to south; All uncurled were the serpents, that bridled his mouth, And the black, clotted stains might yet be seen Of his yesterday's prey the teeth between. XXXII. The Druid approached, with caution and dread; The Wizard was pale; but, was he dead? Here waited the Druid his harp's sweet sound. It's note was now changed; like a deep-drawn sigh, He heard it's faint swell, and he heard it die; Then knew he full well, that danger was nigh. He often and steadfastly looked around: No spectre appeared in the dim-seen bound! The Druid approached, with caution and dread; The Wizard was pale; but, was he dead? As the Druid bent o'er that giant form, While his lamp glared pale on the haggard brow, And showed the huge teeth in a triple row, He muttered the words, that will still a storm, That can struggle with Loke and all his swarm. XXXIII. The mourning winds o'er vast Warwolf were still; No breath from the Wizard's pale lips bodes ill, Yet could not the Druid those fangs once view, And know the task he was bidden to do, Without feeling his very heart-blood chill. He hung his lamp on a sharp rock near, He bent again o'er vast Warwolf's bier, And he touched one fang, with prudent fear. XXXIV. But, why does he start, and why does he stand As though he saw Hela's shadowy hand? He has heard the shriek of his harp afar! He has felt the glance of his evil star! And he hastens to fold his charmed band Round the cold damp brows of his foe. But not all the strength of his magic might Can lift the head from its stony bed, Or the strong bandage pass below, To press the Wizard's forehead tight; So he laid it loosely on the brow. XXXV. Then he took from the rock his faithful lamp, And sprinkled the flame on the forehead damp. Straight the head uprose, and the lips unclosed, And each of the terrible fangs exposed. And now he hastened to pass the band; He tied the knot with a shaking hand, But tied it firm—he tied it fast, That it might well and sure outlast The struggle of every mighty pang. And then he seized one hideous fang, And threw it on the ground! No blood escaped the wound. Hark, to the harp's now rising sound! He knew the fiends were fighting round it, But he knew that his charmed circle bound it. XXXVI. And when he had seized the second tooth, He thought that he heard the Wizard sigh! The third required the strength of youth, But he won it, and the Wizard unclosed an eye! Senseless and dim, at first, it showed, But quickly a livid glare outspread, Which changed to a light of enraged red, And strongly as a furnace glowed. But the glow died away in the livid ray; And, touched by the spell, the eyelid fell, Like a storm-cloud over the setting day. XXXVII. At the ninth drawn fang, the Wizard's hair Rose up and began to twine and twist, Like serpents, and like to serpents hissed! Till it curled all on fire, In many a spire, And the bridle-snakes, that lay on the ground, Began to stir, and to coil them around; And the wolf reared up his grisly head, And fiercely bristled his watchful ears; His foamy jaws grinned close and red, And a rolling fire in his eye appears, As he looks back o'er the Wizard's bed. XXXVIII. Is that the harp? or is it the wind, Murmuring from the cave behind? It is the wind! 'tis not the harp! See! Warwolf's face grows long and sharp; About his mouth a grim smile draws, And the fiends know well his dire applause! The charmed band can scarcely bear The struggling of his writhing brow. Watching that horrid strife, the Druid stood, His harp's tones answered to his fearful mood; Then he thought of the deeds of Balder good: He muttered the Helper song of Odin; He faced to the frost, that has fire within; And thrice he bowed him o'er the bier, Sprinkling the mystic misletoe. Now Warwolf's fiendly smile is gone, His brow is steadfast and severe; Slow falls each hair to it's dark lair, Quenched are the fire-snakes every one. The wolf, half-raised on his worn claws, Stands fixed as stone, with grinning jaws And upward eyes, as watchful still To do his Wizard's vengeful will; His bridle of serpents, coiled o'er his head, Remains, and their tongues are yet living-red; But they dart no death, and no malice they shed; And their hisses have ceased; for their venom is dead! XXXIX. Hark! hark! afar what feeble note Begins, like dawn of day, to float? Hark! it is the rejoicing string, Sounding sweetly along the wind! Never did mortal music fling Notes so cheering, notes so kind. The Druid hoped, yet feared and sighed, And then again his task he plied. XL. Three times nine of the fangs he drew, And the Wizard did not change his hue! Three times three and three times nine, And his lamp more dimly gan to shine. When he tried the very last fang of all, Warwolf lifted an arm on high; And faintly waved the hand, That held the Spectre-Wand, As though he would some evil Spirit call. His arm he did but feebly ply, Like one, who, in an agitating dream, Mimicks some action of his waking hour, Pursuing still his often-baffled aim, And struggling with the wish, without the power, To chase the phantoms, that all living seem! XLI. The Spectre-Wand had lurked within The dragon's many-folded skin, That was the Wizard's shroud. Now, firmly grasping that dread wand, Which ne'er disowned its master's hand, He called on Hela loud!— But he called Hela! once alone. Low sunk the muttered spell; No fiends th' imperfect summons own, His lifted arm down fell. Now tried the Seer, but tried in vain, The hateful Spectre-Wand to gain; Which still vast Warwolf's fingers grasped, As though his only hope they clasped, Till every tendon seemed to strain. XLII. The Druid tried to break the wand, But, by its forceful charm secured, And held, as if by iron hand, The mighty struggle it endured. In the long strife the Druid turned, And spoke again dread Hela's name; The Druid's lamp then faintly burned, Quivered again the failing flame. He, by the signal undismayed, Another daring effort made: He tried again the last strong fang: The Wizard started at the pang, But, though his lips moved at his will, His wish they could not now fulfill. The wolf, though standing fixed as stone, Uttered one long and yelling groan; And his kindling eyes began to stream; Then sunk the Druid's lamp's last gleam! XLIII. Oh! what is become of the harp's far sound? Sadder it mourns, and yet more weak; I hear it but faintly, faintly speak; And I see the Druid upon the ground In speechless alarm, Despairing his charm;— The last of his spells had the fiends now found? XLIV. Whence is the light, that 'gins to wave? 'Tis not his lamp, it's beams are shorn. Nor fire, nor flame, through all the cave The Druid sees, aghast, forlorn. But look not on the Wizard's bier, For, the red light is streaming there, That threatens unknown ill; Both, both his glaring eyes unclose! The hall with lurid lightning glows; As if at Warwolf's will. The harp, the harp! where is it's note? I hear no distant music float! He tried to lift his head From off his rocky bed, But the charmed band was true and strong; Vast Warwolf's groans were loud and long, And every mighty limb convulsive heaved. Could I have told the horrors of his face, The tale, too fearful, would not be believed. Th' astonished Druid stood some little space; So hideous and so ghastly was the sight, That e'en his firmness viewed it with affright; What then he thought may ne'er be told; But what his fate this story may unfold. XLV. Then lifting his eyes from off the bier, A pallid shade confronts him near. It surely is the form of Fear! It has her wild red look, her spectre-eye, Her attitude, as in the act to fly; Her backward glance, her face of livid hue, Her quivering lip, dropping with coldest dew; Her breathless pause, as waiting to descry The nameless, shapeless, harm, that must be nigh! He waved the Branch of Spectres o'er the bier; 'Twas Hela's self—the mother of wan Fear! The Druid knew her by that dreadful wand And by the glimpses of her flitting band. When he saw the berried misletoe, Profaned to conjure deeds of woe, Fear was subdued, indignant ire arose, The Druid-soul, disdainful of repose, Knew not to tamper with his Order's foes. XLVI. She waved it o'er the half-gone Wizard's head; A tremour crept upon his bloodless cheek; And see! he turns upon his rocky bed, He moves his lips, that have not strength to speak. She spoke: “Wake, Warwolf, from thy trance; The phantoms of thy fate advance; Or wake not; th' abject plain shall tell The change, that still awaits thy spell. The sun shall set, the moon shall rise; Four and twenty hours shall go; The sun shall set, the moon shall rise; Then each oak of the forest dies! For thy bones shall have rule below.” XLVII. With shaded eyes the Druid stood, Wrapt in dismay and fearful thought; But now, awaking from his mood, The last of all his spells he wrought. Three bands he tore from his night-woven vest, And sprinkled the oil of his failing lamp. The Wizard sunk on his bed in rest! Thrice on the ground did the Prophetess stamp, And shook her streaming hair In dæmon-like despair, And stretched athwart the bier her withering hand, And, shrieking, waved three times the Spectre-Wand. XLVIII. At the first shriek, dark spreading mists appear; And, in the midst, a Spectre, trembling Fear; A wreath of aspin quivered round her hair. More grisly pale than the Prophetess she; More wild and haggard face could never be. At the next shriek, distorted Pain, With rolling eyes, that seemed to strain, Started along th' affrighted ground, With dreadful yell and fitful bound; Even dark Hela shuddered, as he rose, For Hela could not grant him short repose. To the third shriek the Spectre-Branch waved high. A dim Shape came more dread than Pain or Fear; Fell woe was in her eye, but not one tear! A poniard in her breast, but not one sigh! All ghastly was her face, and yet a smile Was wandering on, but owned no thought, the while; Unnoticed blood distilled from her loose hair! She spoke not, wept not, looked not—'twas Despair! XLIX. Hela, as touched by her cold hand, Stood, when she saw these shadows rise To the false summons of her wand, Stood, like a wretch, who guilty dies. “Ye come uncalled. Why are ye here?” “We wait around vast Warwolf's bier.” “Ye come unwelcomed. Hence, away!” But Hela saw, with dire dismay, Her children would no more obey. They gathered round the Wizard's bed, Despair drooped mutely o'er his head, And Hela sunk, in mist, down to the dead! L. Then the flame of the Druid's lamp returned, And as clear as the morning-light it burned, And the harp's triumphant sound Lightly danced the cavern round, And filled the vaulted roof, on high, With the loud song of truth and joy; Through every hollow rock it rung; The Echoes tell not all the notes, For ne'er before had they heard sung Such song as now around them floats. LI. At the first note, round Warwolf's bier, The ghastly shadows disappear, And a dark cloud began to rise, That wrapt him from the Druid's eyes, Who gathered and counted the conquered fangs; Then, thankful, from the cave he hies, To seek the lorn place, where the cymbal clangs Of the Wizard's imp, as it watches his bower; There to bury the teeth, at the magic hour. LII. From the mouth of the cave his harp he took, And hung it near his grateful heart; The wires with answering rapture shook, And hope and courage did impart. But its cautious master, true To the whole task he had to do, Bent, with tempered mind, his way, Whither the Sorcerer's bower lay. Through the forest he heard afar The cymbal's hoarsely-clanging jar, Till he came to a widely-spreading plain, Then ceased the Wizard's threatening strain; All was still as yon setting star. But, for the bower he looked around in vain, Unless that giant-tree be his strange bower, A ruin now like him, and 'reft of power. LIII. In the centre it stood—a withered oak; It's shadow was gone, and it's branches broke; It's mighty trunk, knotted all round and round, And gnarled roots, o'erspreading the ground, Were proofs of summers that on it had shone, And honours of old from the tempests won, In generations all past and gone. And a scant foliage yet was seen, Wreathing it's hoary brows with green; Like to a crown of victory, On some old Warrior's forehead grey. So reverend was it's look, it seemed to speak Of times long buried, that had passed it by And left it there thus desolate to sigh To the wild winter-winds, in murmurs weak; A spectre of the woods, shadeless and pale, A form of vanished ages, whose dark tale It once beheld, and seemed by fits to wail. LIV. Here came the Druid, with firm, silent tread, To bury deep the fangs of Warwolf dread. Now, by the waning Moon's red, slanting ray, By her long, gloomy shadows on the way, Two circles round about the oak he traced, And, as with measured step and slow he paced, And Runic words of secret import drew, The mighty lines wider and wider grew, As watery circles o'er a lake increase; At length they rested, where he bade them cease. Watching the minutes of the downward moon, He walked th' enchanted Celtic circles duly o'er; Dropping, at every bidden step, a fang. One fang to every step he gave, no more, Meanwhile his harp, unsmote, with strange notes rang! The vast circumference he paced not soon; One hundred and forty minute-steps past, Ere was paced the widest circle and last; And the pale moon, behind the forest-shade, Sunk with a small and smaller curve of light; O'er the wood-tops he watched her last glow fade, Till every lingering ray was lost in night. The hour is won!—the spell is done! The Druid to rest in his bower is gone! LV. Now listen and watch, and you shall see What passed around that old oak-tree. The marvellous story must now be told Of the ban's last force of Warwolf bold. When next the midnight-moon was seen, The Druid returned to the forest green; That forest green on yester-night, Now mourned in all its leaves a blight! And now were its branches shattered and bare; Nor tree, nor bough, did the Sorcerer spare, Dire was the hour when he waked from his swoon! O'er all the region, far and nigh, Far as the Druid cast his eye, (Under the glimpses of the low-hung moon) The lands all black and desolate lie! But whither the Wizard his-self was fled, And whether still living in trance, or dead, Or what was become of his horrid den, Were matters not reached by the Druid's ken. Nor cliff, nor rock, was e'er seen from that hour, On wilds, that had owned the Sorcerer's power; Not an oak, or green bank, on hill or dale, That once waved in Summer's and Winter's gale. LVI. The Druid pressed on through the lifeless wood, Till he reached the plain, where the old oak stood. Now listen and watch, and you shall see What was done around that warrior tree. Scarce could the Druid now believe, That phantoms did not his eyes deceive, As he looked o'er this desert land, Far as his vision could command. Is it the light, that mocks his sight? Or shadows, that now the low moon throws? What dark and mighty shapes are those, Standing like dæmons of the night? Nearer and nearer the Seer now goes, Taller and taller the figures arose! Astonished he saw, on the plain around, In the circles he traced on the teeth-sown ground, A hundred and forty figures stand, A lofty and motionless giant-band! He paused in the midst, and calmly viewed Their strange array and their sullen mood. High wonder filled his mind, as this he saw. And wonder still and reverential awe, From age to age, have filled the gazer's mind, With sweet yet melancholy dread combined. Stonehenge is the name of the place this day, But what more it means no man may say. LVII. Who, that beholds these solid masses rude, Could guess they ever were with life endued? And yet, receive the marvel that I tell, These mighty masses held the Wizard's spell! They were his buried fangs, and upward sprung By nerve of magic, which they yet retained, Dilating to enormous size and shape, While from their prison-grave they strove t' escape. But here their effort ceased, and, wildly flung, They in their mighty shapes have since remained. Their effort, but not yet their power, has ceased, For, as the ages of the world increased, Still with the charm of wonder they have bound Whoever stepped in their enchanted ring, And when the learned held the truth was found, The daily and the nightly thought, So long pursued, so closely caught, Has proved a feather dropped from Fancy's wing! And thus have two thousand ages rolled, But the truth till now was never told! Unsuspected it lay, Closely hid from the day, Till some smatterer bold Should the secrets of Druid lore unfold. LVIII. The Hermit, by the wondrous vision won, Felt not the shuddering earth, nor heard the gale O'er the far wilderness come sweeping on, With gathering strength and wildly sweeping yell, Till, like some fiendly voice it burst around, And gradual died along the hollow ground. Then he knew it the Wizard's blast; It was his fiercest and his last, And came for vengeance on the Druid's head; But with his fangs his evil power was fled. And, when rung out the harp's rejoicing swell, The Druid knew that all was once more well. Then to his bowery home his steps he turned, And slept the sleep by conscious virtue earned. His fortitude the Wizard's spell had braved; His patient wisdom a wide land had saved! LIX. From forth that day began the Druid sway O'er all this widely stretching plain, And hamlets few that on their border lay. Still did the Druids long remain In the lone desert, far from vulgar eye, 'Wrapt in high thought and solemn mystery. The circle of the Wizard's fangs, 'tis said, Was their great temple, where, on certain days, In triumph for the tyrant-dæmon fled, They gathered from the country far around, And sang, with nameless rites, their mystic lays, Here on this rescued memorable ground. LX. And thus they ruled, for age succeeding age. There is one later record, which doth spell, But in what scroll, or rhyme, or numbered page, Or letter black, or white, I cannot tell— There is one record, could it now be found, Doth spell the words which, spoken on that ground, By the wan light of the setting moon, When night is far past her highest noon— Words, that make sight so strong and fine, As will the Druids' shadowy figures show, When in their long and stately march they go, Around and round that mighty line, Where yet the Wizard's fangs uprear Their monstrous shapes upon the air. And, as they glide those shapes between, A beam-touched harp does sometimes shine, Or golden fillet's glance is seen; While long devolving robes of snow, Wave on the wind, and round their footsteps flow. And then are heard the wild, fantastic strains, Which Druid-charm has left to dignify these plains. LXI. Such was the scene, and such are the sounds, Linked with the history of these grounds! Nay, 'tis said that, at this very hour, Without aid from any words of power, If mortal has courage to go alone To that remote circle and count each stone, When the midnight-moon doth silently reign Over the pathless and desolate plain, Gliding forms may ev'n yet be viewed, Of lofty port and solemn mood, Performing rites ill understood By people of this latter day! How this may be I cannot say; For nobody of these days can be found To venture alone to that distant ground, When the midnight moon walks over the land, With slow, soundless step and beckoning wand, And cold shadows following her command. LXII. But, not for kindly sprites alone, Is now that haunted region known, Since the antique Seers are gone. 'Tis said that, sometimes, even there Fiendish sprites will ride on the air! To lone shepherd their forms appear. Their forms in the tempest's first gloom he finds; And this is the cause that the hurrying winds Sweep so swiftly, and moan so loud, As o'er those haunted downs they crowd. On the waste's edge they gather and brood; Then, meeting the wild fiend's fiercest mood, They scud o'er the desert, through clouds, through rain, Like ship, with her storm-sail set, on the main. While the Druids lived, these evil bands Kept far aloof from the guarded lands. But, when the last died, the Sorcerer's ban Gained part of the force, with which it began. LXIII. And this is the cause why corn will not spring, Nor a bird of summer will rest his wing, Nor will the cottager here build his home, Nor hospitable mansion spread its dome; Why the plain never hears merry peal, Announcing benefactor's weal, Nor e'en lone bell in village tower Knells the irrevocable hour; Why the dead find not here a hallowed grave, Why the bush will not bud, nor tall tree wave. And why Salisbury steeple was built so high As though fairies had reared it to prop the sky! For the mischievous sprites they once came so nigh, They threatened all the country round, Castles and woods, and meadow-ground, That kindly peer o'er the edge of the plain, Like a sunny shore o'er a stormy main; Nay, they came so near to Salisbury town, The people within feared the walls would down. LXIV. Then they built a tower, as by charmed hands, So grand, yet so simple, its airy form! To guard the good town from all fiendish bands, And avert the dreaded pitiless storm. And they fenced the tower with pinnacles light, And they traced fine open-work all around; It is, at this day, a beautiful sight! And they piled on the tower a spire so high, That it looked o'er all the Sorcerer's ground, And almost it vanished into the sky. So lofty a steeple the world cannot show; Nor, drawn on the air with the truth of a line, A form so majestic, so gracefully fine; Nor a tower more richly adorned below, Where fretted pinnacles attend, The spire's first ascent to defend, And catch the bright purple of evening's glow, While, sinking in shadows, the long roofs go. This spire, viewed by the dawn's blue light, Or rising darkly on the night, As with tall black line to measure the sphere, While stars beside it more glorious appear, Has so holy a look, not of earth it seems, But some vision unknown save in Fancy's dreams. LXV. Now this good spire thus high they made, All the land to watch and ward, That the ill sprites, whene'er they strayed, To their confines might be awed. It could see on the wide horizon's bound Each shade, good or bad, as it walked its round, Whether a fairy or fiend, Whether a foe or a friend. It could see the procession move along With glittering harps, in robes of white; It could hear the responsive far-borne song Faintly swell o'er the wide-stretched plain, Then sink, till all was still again, And sleeping in the clear moonlight. So this beautiful spire did watch and wake, And guarded the land for Innocence' sake. LXVI. And, at this very day, Let but the feeblest ray, Or gleam, of moonshine chance to fall Over this steeple so slenderly tall, Or but glimmer upon the trembling vane; Though the 'nighted traveller on the plain, While he perceives it faintly shine, Peering over upland downs afar,— Though he hails it for the morning-star, Yet all too well the warning sign Know the bands of the Wizard's line! Soon as they spy its watching eye, Whether by moonlight, or by morn, Sullen they sigh, and shrink and fly, Where sun, or moonbeam, never warn. So this beautiful spire does watch and wake, And still guards the land for Innocence' sake. SHAKSPEARE'S CLIFF. Here, all along the high sea-cliff, Oh, how sweet it is to go! When Summer lures the light-winged skiff Over the calm expanse below,— And tints, with shades of sleepy blue, Misty ocean's curving shores; And with a bright and gleaming hue, Dover's high embattled towers. How sweet to watch the blue haze steal Over the whiteness of yon sail; O'er yon fair cliffs, and now conceal Boulogne's walls and turrets pale! Oh! go not near that dizzy brink, Where the mossed hawthorn hangs its root, To look how low the sharp crags sink, Before the tide they overshoot. Nor listen for their hollow sound— Thou canst not hear the surges mourn, Nor see how high the billows bound Among the caves their rage has worn. Yet, yet forbear! thou canst not spring, Like fay, from off this summit high, And perch upon the out-stretched wing Of the sea-mew passing by, And safely with her skirt the clouds; Or, sweeping downward to the tide, Frolic amid the seaman's shrouds, Or on a bounding billow ride. Ah! no; all this I cannot do; Yet I will dare the mountain's height, Seas and shores and skies to view, And cease but with the dim day-light. For fearful-sweet it is to stand On some tall point 'tween earth and heaven, And view, far round, the two worlds blend, And the vast deep by wild winds riven. And fearful-sweet it is to peep Upon the yellow strands below, When on their oars the fishers sleep, And calmer seas their limits know. And bending o'er this jutting ridge, To look adown the steep rock's sides, From crag to crag, from ledge to ledge, Down which the samphire-gatherer glides. Perhaps the blue-bell nods its head, Or poppy trembles o'er the brink, Or there the wild-briar roses shed Their tender leaves of fading pink. Oh fearful-sweet it is, through air To watch their scattered leaves descend, Or mark some pensile sea-weed dare Over the perilous top to bend, And, joyous in its liberty, Wave all its playful tresses wide, Mocking the death, that waits for me, If I but step one foot aside. Yet I can hear the solemn surge Sounding long murmurs on the coast; And the hoarse waves each other urge, And voices mingling now, then lost. The children of the cliffs I hear, Free as the waves, as daring too; They climb the rocky ledges there, To pluck sea-flowers of humble hue. Their calling voices seem to chime; Their choral laughs rise far beneath, While, who the dizziest point can climb, Throws gaily down the gathered wreath. I see their little upward hands, Outspread to catch the falling flowers, While, watching these, the little bands Sing welcomes to the painted showers. And others scramble up the rocks, To share the pride of him, who, throned On jutting crag, at danger mocks, King of the cliffs and regions round. Clinging with hands and feet and knee, How few that envied height attain! Not half-way up those urchins, see, Yet ply their perilous toil in vain. Fearless their hero sports in air, A rival almost of the crows, And weaves fresh-gathered blossoms there, To bind upon his victor-brows. The broad sea-myrtle glossy bright, Mixed with the poppy's scarlet bell, And wall-flowers, dipt in golden light, Twine in his sea-cliff coronal. The breeze has stolen his pageant-crown; He leans to mark how low it falls; Oh, bend not thou! lest, headlong down, Thou paint'st with death these fair sea-walls! Now, o'er the sky's concave I glance, Now o'er the azure deep below, Now on the long-drawn shores of France, And now on England's coast I go, To where old Beachy's beaked head, High peering in the utmost West, Bids the observant seaman dread, Lest he approach his guarded rest. What fairy hand hangs loose that sail In graceful fold of sunny light? Beneath what tiny figures move, Traced darkly on the wave's blue light? It is the patient fisher's sloop, Watching upon the azure calm; They are his wet sea-boys, that stoop, And haul the net with bending arm. But on this southern coast is seen, From Purbeck hills to Dover piers, No foam-tipt wave so clearly green, No rock so dark as Hastings rears. How grand is that indented bay, That sweeps to Romney's sea-beat wall, Whose marshes slowly stretch away, And slope into some green hill small. Now North and East I bend my sight To where the flats of Flanders spread; And now where Calais cliffs are bright, Made brighter by the sunset red. Shows not this towering point so high To him, who in mid-channel sails; For the slant light from western sky Ne'er on its awful front prevails. But mark! on this cliff Shakspeare stood, And waved around him Prosper's wand, When straight from forth the mighty flood The Tempest “rose, at his command!” THE FISHERS. STEEPHILL. Behold this rocky bay! On either hand Cliffs dark and frantic rise and stretch away To yon bold promontories, East and West, Hanging amid the clouds; that shut out all, Save seas and skies and sails dim-moving on Th' horizon's edge, and the rough boat, that skirts, With slow and wary course, this ruinous strand. Far 'mong the waves, are shown gigantic limbs Of these stern shores, whose out-post Terror is, Whose eyes look down on desolation, pain, Shipwreck and death. Yet, half way up the rocks, And scarce beyond the salt spray's reach, when storms Of winter beat, perched where the sea-mew rests In sun-beam, a low fisher's cabin peeps From its green sheltering nook. Wild mountainous shrubs Hang beetling o'er it, and such flowers as grow On rocky ledges, brought by the unseen Air, messengers from off some fertile hill Or dale, or haply from far forest's side; The scarlet poppy and the blue corn-flower, The wild rose and the purple bells, that chime In th' evening breeze to the poor woodlark's notes. Full to the South, the fisher's cottage peeps, And overlooks how many lonely leagues Of ocean, sleeping in its summer haze Of downy blue, or green, or purple, shades, Charming the heart to musing and sweet peace! How solemn, when our autumn's moon goes down, And walks in silence on the farthest waves, (Then sinks, leaving brief radiance in the air,) To measure out a few short moments here, By the sad, dying glow! But sweet, O then, most sweet! when the clear dawn Of June breaks on, and blesses the horizon. In holy stillness it dispels the shades Of night, appearing like the work sublime Of Goodness,—a meek emblem of the Just And Living God! Bending our heads with awe And grateful adoration, we exclaim— “Father of Light! Thou art our Father too; We are Thy creatures; and these glorious beams Attest, that in Thy goodness we are made For bliss eternal.” There stands the fisher's hut, and close beside, A mountain-stream winds round the mossed platform, Singing wild lullaby to the wailing surge, As 'mid resisting brakes and massy crags, It seeks a passage to the shore below. There, hauled above the reach of flowing tides And the high-bounding spray, the sea-boat rests, Huge, sturdy, heavy, almost round, and formed For labour and hard strife with the rough sea; About the fisher's cot, from crag to crag, His nets hang round in many a graceful sweep, 'Midst his long lines and treacherous baits and hooks. Beside his door, the aged fisher weaves New meshes for his sons, and sends, at times, A look far o'er the ocean, where the beam O' the west falls brightest, for the adventurers, Who yester-morn went forth, and all night long Watched patient on the waters, and all day Have hauled the net, or laboured at the oar. More fearful roves his eye, as sinks the sun, While sad he marks September's stormy cloud Fire all the West, and tip with crimson hues, Though less resplendent, ev'n the nearer waves While the broad flush tinges his silver locks And his brown visage and his garments blue. Anxious, he throws aside th' unfinished web, And climbs the higher crag, and thence afar, Turning the western cape, he sees the glance Of oars withdrawing, and the square sail set And swelling to the breeze. With struggling toil The poor bark seeks its home, ere night and tempest Meet on the billows. While she thus, scarce known, Alternate rides the ridge and then is lost Below the shelving wave, widely they steer Athwart the dangerous surge, though not that way Lies their dear home; but well they know where lurk The rocks unseen, and where the currents flow. Suddenly drops the sail, and now again This way they bend, while, as they ply once more The oars, just heard, and turn, with scrupulous eyes, To view their narrow course, a faint ray shows Their sun-burnt features and their ragged locks, Beneath the sea-worn hat. Nearer now they move, And now scarce lift the oar, so cautiously They creep along the strand, and wind their way Among its half-seen rocks. Stays the old fisher on the high crag now? No; yonder down the steep path slow he steps, And his wave-faring children hails afar. Meanwhile upon the beach, patient and cold, Stands the poor horse, with drooping head and eyes Half-shut, and panniers all too wide and deep, Waiting the cargo, that his master, tired And sauntering on the water's edge, shall bring: Then must he bear it up high cliffs and hills, To the far vale, where lies some peopled town. Now slowly grounds the skiff, and the glad fishers, Mounting the beach, the bended grapple cast. “What luck? what luck? my boys!” “Good luck, my father!” And forth they pour the treasure of the main, With many a scaly form unshapely, strange! The dog-fish monstrous, with his high, round back, And look voracious. Oh! ill-named is he, After man's careful, tender, faithful friend! The spotted Seston, So called by the fishermen. dragon-like, with wings And jaws terrific; and the giant skate. Then dark-mailed forms, Lobsters. that die in torture wild, Unfitted, therefore, for the feast of man, To whom abundant guiltless food is given. And last, a shape, the fairy of the wave, Clad in transparent tints of silver comes. Whitings. But see where the last gleam of the day's sun, Far from behind that western promontory, Slants 'thwart the deep curve of this shaded bay, Tinges yon headland of the eastern shore, And goes in stillness down on the fair waves, Seeming to say, “Children of Time, farewell! Your course draws nearer to Eternity; Even thus must fade your glory in this world:— But sure as dark shades of the night lead on To morning, the sun-set of earthly life Leads to the dawn of an eternal day:— Think of that dawn!” Now doth the aged fisher mutely watch, While his stout sons fling o'er their shoulders broad Deep osier baskets hung with pebbles round; Then, wrapt in his blue mantle, stalks away, Beneath the dark cliffs beetling o'er the sea, To those low rocks, that stretch, point after point, Far out amid the tide, crowned with black moss. There, in the waves, safe from rapacious force, And from the eye of plunderer close concealed, He leaves his treasure, for to-morrow's care; Then hies he homeward. There, amidst the friends He loves, reposes. All last night, he watched Upon the rocking main; the arching sky His sole, cold roof; the stars his only guides Through the vast shadow of the lonely deep! This night, how calm his dream, how sweet his sleep, In the safe shelter of his cabin small, With his glad family round him hush'd in peace! IN THE NEW FOREST. Wanderer! if thy path bend o'er these lawns And forest-lands, stay thy rejoicing steps— Though they would fain bound with yon fawns and hinds Down the green slope, and skim the level turf To other slopes, and other pluming groves,— Stay thy intemperate spirit, and mark well Each beauty of the scene, and the strong lights And stormy sunshine, that fall o'er these shades! Pause thou awhile, that, in some future hour, When the long sunless storm of winter broods, And thou sitt'st lonely by thy evening hearth, In melancholy twilight, listening The far-off tempest,—then sweet Memory May come, and with her mirror cheer thy mind, On whose bright surface lovelier scenes shall live Than any shrined within Italian climes; And every graceful form and shaded hue, As now it lives, again shall smile before thee: For England, beauteous England, scarce can boast, Through her green vales and plains and wavy hills, Another landscape of such sylvan grace. 'Twas surely here, that Shakspeare dreamt of fays, And in these shades Titania held her court, And bade her tiny bands in starlight revel. Those tufts of oak, that crown the swelling lawn, Those were her shady halls at high moon-tide; And yon light ash her summer-night pavilion, Lighted by dew-drops and the flickering blaze, That glances from the high electric north. Where'er the groves retire and meadows rise, There were her carpets spread, of various tints From turf and amorous lichen, all combined With soft flowers and transparent azure-bells, On whose pure skin their purple veins appear. And over all these hues a veil is thrown Of silvery dew, oft lighted by the moon. Temper thy joyous spirit, wanderer! And 'gainst the wintry hour, when thorns alone Hold forth their berries, cull sweet summer-buds. Then shall the deep gloom vanish, the storm sink! The balmy air of woods shall soothe thy sense, And their broad leaves thy landscape canopy, E'en in December's melancholy day! And now bound with those fawns down the green slope, Skim the smooth turf to other hills and groves, In the full joy of sunshine and new hopes. ON A FIRST VIEW OF THE GROUP CALLED THE SEVEN MOUNTAINS; IN THE APPROACH TO COLOGNE FROM XANTEN. When first I saw ye, Mountains, the broad sun In cloudy grandeur sunk, and showed, far off, A solemn vision of imperfect shapes Crowding the southward sky and stalking on And pointing us “the way that we should go.” Dark thunder-mists dwelt on ye; and your forms, Obscurely towering, stood before the eye, Like some strange thing portentous and unknown. I watched the coming storm. The sulphurous gloom Clung sullenly round me, and a dull tinge Began to redden through these mournful shades. A low imperfect murmur o'er ye rolled. Doubtful, I listened. On the breathless calm Again I heard it—then, ye Mountains vast, Amid the tenfold darkness ye withdrew, And vanished quite, save that your high tops smoked, And from your clouds the arrowy lightnings burst, While peals resistless shook the trembling world!— A SECOND VIEW OF THE SEVEN MOUNTAINS. Mountains! when next I saw ye it was Noon, And Summer o'er your distant steeps had flung Her veil of misty light: your rock-woods hung Just green and budding, though in pride of June, And pale your many-spiring tops appeared, While, here and there, soft tints of silver grey Marked where some jutting cliff received the ray; Or long-lived precipice its brow upreared. Beyond your tapering pinnacles, a show Of other giant-forms more dimly frowned, Hinting the wonders of that unknown ground, And of deep wizard-vales, unseen below. Thus, o'er the long and level plains ye rose Abrupt and awful, when my raptured eye Beheld ye. Mute I gazed! 'Twas then a sigh Alone could speak the soul's most full repose; For of a grander world ye seemed the dawn, Rising beyond where Time's tired wing can go, As, bending o'er the green Rhine's liquid lawn, Ye watched the ages of the world below. ON ASCENDING A HILL CROWNED WITH A CONVENT. NEAR BONN. Up the mossed steeps of this round hill we climbed, Tracking amid close woods our doubtful way; When, high above, the lonely vesper chimed On the still hour of the declining day. We paused to listen, and to taste awhile The pure air scented with the bruised herb; And catch the distant landscape's parting smile, Ere the light breeze the shadowy boughs disturbed. “Oh verdant foliage! in your dancing play, Hide not those soft blue lines, that northward swell, And of far mountain-regions faintly tell! Wrap not in your high shades those turrets grey, That rear themselves above the Rhine's broad flood, Where the slow bark, with wide, out-stretched wings, Her lengthening shadow o'er the waters flings.” Onward we pass amid the closing wood, Till, once again emerging from the night, O'er a near ridge of darkest pine we spy The peaks of eastward mountains, peering high; Touched with gay colours and with sunshine bright, They draw clear lines on the transparent sky, And lift their many-tinctured forms of light! With weary step a convent's porch we found. What music met us on that holy ground, Swelling the song of peace and praise to Him, Who clad with glory all the prospect round! Our full hearts echoed back the grateful hymn. A turret's utmost height at length we gain, And stand as on a point above the world, Viewing the heaven's vast canopy unfurled, And the great circle's widely-spreading line Sink low, and softly into light decline. There, in far distance, on the western plain, Thy spires, Cologne, gleamed to the setting ray: Thy useless ramparts and thy turrets grey Hinted where still the cowled city lay. Oh melancholy walls! unlike the view, That the sweet poet of Vauclusa drew, When, wreathed with flowers, thy maidens fair advance, With choral songs and steps of airy dance, And to the Rhine's fleet wave, Petrarch notices this ceremony in one of his letters. “The sun was declining: and scarcely was I alighted, when these unknown friends brought me to the bank of the Rhine, to amuse me with a spectacle which is exhibited every year, on the same day, and on the same place. They conducted me to a little hill, from whence I could discover all that passed along the river. An innumerable company of women covered its banks: their air, their faces, their dress struck me ? In the midst of the vast crowd this sight had drawn together, I was surprised to find neither tumult nor confusion; a great joy appeared without licentiousness. How pleasant was it to behold these women; their heads crowned with flowers, their sleeves tucked up above their elbows, with a sprightly air advancing to wash their hands and arms in the river. They pronounced something in their language, which appeared pleasing, but I did not understand it. Happily, I found an interpreter at hand; I desired one who came with me to explain to me this ceremony. He told me it was an ancient opinion spread among the people, and particularly the women, that this lustration was necessary to remove all the calamities with which human beings are threatened in the course of the year; and, when this was done, they had nothing to fear till the following year, at which time the ceremony must be renewed.” on summer's eve, Their blooming garlands and their sorrows give. How changed the scene! Now paler forms appear, Wrapt in black garments and with brow severe; And, as with shaded eyes they stalk along, Receive poor homage from the passing throng. Oh melancholy walls! always, as now, Be seen at distance on the landscape's brow! That stretching landscape various shades o'erspread, Of yellow corn and bowery vineyards green; There the brown orchard reared its tufted head, And there the Rhine's long-winding light was seen, With castles crowned was its rocky shore, And famed for dismal tales in early lore. Northward, the far Westphalian lands withdrew, Line above line, in level tints of blue; While to the West, where forest hills extend, The long perspective lifts a pomp of shade, Mellowed with evening lights, where sweetly blend Convents and spires, as if for peace-marks made. Such were the scenes, that from the falling sun, (When he his bright and blessed course had run) Threw their long shadows, mourners of past day, And then in stillness slept beneath his ray. But other scenes a holier homage paid, Where, eastward, pointing up the heavenly way, Above the thunder's cloud and cloud of Time, Those everlasting mountains stand sublime, And to the sun's Creator lift the head! Steadfast upon the Rhine's tumultuous shore, Ye listened, Mountains, to the distant roar, The battle-shout of nations now no more. Ye viewed the suns of centuries go down, And smiled, as now, beneath their farewell beam; Ye saw the thunder-storms of ages gleam, The elemental and the human frown, And heard afar the mingled strife pass by Into the silence of Eternity! Unchanged amid the ever-changing scene, As in the world's first dawn, ye still appear, With beauty bright, majestic, young, serene, Clothed in the colours of the various year. While rainbow-colours indistinctly lay On the lone summits, till, in slow decay, They seemed like far-hung clouds on Evening's pall, Just purpled with a melancholy ray; While dark we saw the mountain-shadows fall, And steal the valleys and the woods away! Then all in paleness came the twilight-star, And, pensive, seemed to bend upon the West; As though she watched th' expiring sun afar, And bade, with tearful smile, his spirit rest! Oh! then how sweetly and how solemn rose The requiem-strains, that, in the parting hour, Beneath the sacred roof responses pour; While all without was hushed in deep repose. The air's soft breathings scarce were heard to die, Save when among the braided vines it crept, And waked the quivering tendril with its sigh. Thus earth and air their hour of slumber kept! All but the stars! Slumbering too long in light, They now through shade their opening eyes reveal, In trembling glances, to their empress—Night, Keeping high watch till forth the Morning steal, From adverse darkness. Self-supported, great, Ye, tranquil 'mid the louring storms of fate, Rise, like the honest mind, in the dread hour, When stern Adversity tries Virtue's power:— Thus ye, distinguished through the fearful gloom, A steadfast strength and brighter mien assume. Thus, 'mid the changing lights, that life pervade, May we, like you, assailing clouds dispel— Grateful in sunshine—steadfast in the shade! Farewell! ye awful monitors, farewell! THE SNOW-FIEND. Hark! to the Snow-Fiend's voice afar That shrieks upon the troubled air! Him by that shrilly call I know— Though yet unseen, unfelt below— And by the mist of livid grey, That steals upon his onward way. He from the ice-peaks of the North In sounding majesty comes forth; Dark amidst the wondrous light, That streams o'er all the northern night. A wan rime through the airy waste Marks where unseen his car has past; And veils the spectre-shapes, his train, That wait upon his vengeful reign. Disease and Want and shuddering Fear Danger and Woe and Death are there. Around his head for ever raves A whirlwind cold of misty waves. But oft, the parting surge between, His visage, keen and white, is seen; His savage eye and paly glare Beneath a helm of ice appear; A snowy plume waves o'er the crest, And wings of snow his form invest. Aloft he bears a frozen wand; The ice-bolt trembles in his hand; And ever, when on sea he rides, An iceberg for his throne provides. As, fierce, he drives his distant way, Agents remote his call obey, From half-known Greenland's snow-piled shore To Newfoundland and Labrador; O'er solid seas, where nought is scanned To mark a difference from land, And sound itself does but explain The desolation of his reign; The moaning querulous and deep, And the wild howl's infuriate sweep Where'er he moves, some note of woe Proclaims the presence of the foe; While he, relentless, round him flings The white shower from his flaky wings. Hark! 'tis his voice:—I shun his call, And shuddering seek the blazing hall. O! speak of mirth; O! raise the song! Hear not the fiends, that round him throng Of curtained rooms and firesides tell, Bid Fancy work her genial spell, That wraps in marvel and delight December's long tempestuous night; Makes courtly groups in summer bowers Dance through pale Winter's midnight hours; And July's eve its rich glow shed On the hoar wreath, that binds his head; Or knights on strange adventure bent, Or ladies into thraldom sent; Whatever gaiety ideal Can substitute for troubles real. Then let the storms of Winter sing, And his sad veil the Snow-Fiend fling, Though wailing lays are in the wind, They reach not then the 'tranced mind; Nor murky form, nor dismal sound May pass the high, enchanted bound! AN ANCIENT BEECH-TREE. IN THE PARK, AT KNOLE. THE WOODLAND NYMPH. Down in yon glade, that points to the red West, O'erhung with ancient groves, whose shadows fall So darkly on the ground, that the green moss Is hardly known beneath them;—in yon glade, Just where the trees irregularly part In long perspective, and an evening scene Of sylvan grandeur glimmers, stands a beech, Like some gigantic sentinel, advanced On watch to guard the pass to sacred haunts. Approach, and let thy nobler mind prevail; And, as thine eye measures its form, its large Grey limbs upstretching in the air, among The pendent, rich, luxuriant foliage, Over the silvery rind, moss-mottled, showing Like gleams of light 'mid their green shadows; if Grace and grandeur ever touched thine heart, adore And weep—weep tears of deep delight, and tears Of gratitude, that thou canst weep such tears! If thou would'st see in full magnificence This canopy, most surely the domain Of some lone Dryad,—come when Evening casts Her yellow light, and gives its lower shades Their most luxuriant tinge; speak not, but watch And thou 'lt see haply at this dewy hour The Nymph of this deep shade 'rise from her sleep. The scared hind, bounding athwart the glades, Springs not so lightly, nor so graceful turns, When, listening to the step, that startles her, She bends her slender neck and branched head And shows her dark eyes, bright and innocent. Oh, Nymph of graces, playful as these boughs, When gentle airs play o'er them, thee I know, And have, at eve, beheld thy dance of joy In the proud shade, that shields thee from the storm, And guards thy slumbers from the summer rain. Thy noon-tide slumbers, too, I have beheld, And the high canopy of boughs bespread, When, laid in peace upon the twilight moss, Where the green shadows deep and coolest fall, Thy fairy court watched round thee—court of Elves That dwell unseen within the hollow leaves Or inmost foliage, rocked by summer sighs. These have I seen around thy mossy couch, Fanning thy slumber with long leaves of lilies, Scattering the white bells in thy twisted hair, And binding each dark lock with wreaths of flowers. Thy footsteps trod the tender hyacinth, Blue and transparent as the light of Morn, The dark-eyed violet, that weeps perfume, The wild-rose tinted with the Dawn's first blush, And sparkling with the tears and smiles she shed, When, scattered from her hand, it fell to earth. This ancient beech, this sylvan wonder, triumphs Over the oak, whose spreading pomp has crowned him King o' the woods; but his magnificence Is rude and heavy,—while this lonely beech, With all its wealth of green, transparent shadows, (A graceful hill of leaves in the blue air,) Still must be hailed the hero of the forest! SEA-VIEWS. MIDNIGHT. Carolling sweetly to the midnight gale Above the strife of waves, his voice is heard— The sea-boy's voice, who, on some top-sail yard, Bows with the mast, and hangs amid the clouds, Or sweeps the salt foam from the billow's ridge, And mocks its fury. Far around he sees, Beneath the night-gloom, ocean's wondrous fires Flashing from surge to surge—a boding light, That seems the spirit of the troubled realm. Palely it gleams, though bright, now near, now distant, Shapeless, though visible—though threatening, mute: Still, sweet he carols on the dizzy cap. Anon, he hears the storm-bird's slender cry, And scarcely marks her flitting round and round And sheltering in the shrouds. Oh, fearful bird! Herald of warring winds! he heeds thee not; Nor yet those hollow sounds from strand unseen; Nor e'en those sullen lights among the clouds, Whose hue they show more livid; for, behold! Like to a star, which in th' horizon dawns, There gleam those guiding, ever watchful fires, Placed on some low peninsula's long line, Or on some promontory's pointed horn, And spied far on the solitary waves By the poor mariner, who, rocked upon His dark and billowy cradle, thinks of home, His little cabin, sheltered by the cliff, His blazing hearth, bright through the casement seen, And all the dear-loved faces shining round; And knows the smiles of welcome ambushed there. Still cheerly sings the watch-boy; down he goes Through gasping seas; now driving down the gulph, Now rising light in air; while nearer roll The thunders of the shore, reverbed from caves Surge-worn, and cliffs high arching o'er the tide. But now the plunging lead is heard, and now The sullen voice of one below calls out The sounded fathoms; then the master bids His last sail furl; for well-known sands are nigh, And louder sweeps the gale. At last, he nears Those friendly beacon fires, the level line Of distance changes for the rugged shores, Whose tops the horizontal twilight mark; Soon they rise up more bold, solemn, distinct; And wide unfolds the hospitable bay, On whose deep margin spreads the wished-for port, With many dim lamps quivering in the blast. No joyful shout hails th' approaching crew; For Sleep has waved his potent wand on high! The lonely pier receives them; on they steer For quiet depth, and gradually steal Into the silent harbour—silent save The drowsy rippling of the faint sea-tide, Or when the watch-dog, on some neighbouring deck, His honest vigil barks, as strangers pass. And now each heart beats joyfully, as drops The ready anchor; busy footsteps sound; Loud swells the mingled voice; the narrow plank Is hoisted and extends a tottering bridge, That bears them to the quay; there, bounding light Once more they press the firm earth, and once more Each to his long-left home in safety goes. Dark is the way and silent; yet awhile And an awakening voice shall call up hope, And all the poor man's wealth, the wealth of heart! TO THE SWALLOW. O happy bird! thy gay return I hail; For now I see young Spring, with all her train Of sports and joys, borne on the western gale, And hear afar her sweetly warbling strain. Once more the opening clouds shall now disclose The heaven's blue vault—the sun's all-cheering ray: The vales, once more, in tender green repose, The violet wake beneath the breath of May. O happy bird! how playful and how light Thy circling pinions skim the upward air; Exulting, gay and playful in thy flight, Companion of the Summer season fair! Yet, while I welcome thee, and wish thee long, I sigh to think that ere the Autumn fade, Thou'lt seek, in other climes, a vernal song, More gentle gales and renovated shade. Ev'n now I see thee on the light clouds soar, And melt in distant æther from my view; As laughing Summer, to the western shore, Over the seas Biscayan you pursue. Thy policy to us, ah! dost thou lend? Flies thus, with gay prosperity—the friend? FOREST LAWNS. Oh, forest lawns!—Oh, lawns of tender green, That spread in sunshine, crowned with copsy groves, Or, winding in deep glades, retire among The shades of ages, my glad steps receive! Oh! let me, with your fawns, bound o'er these slopes, Fresh with the dew, that melts apace before The morning ray, leaving long level lines Of hoary silver, 'mid the various hues Of lichen, turf and mead-flower. Let me seek, With tempered pace and reverential thought, Your far-seen solitudes and deepest gloom, And often note the monarch of the woods In pious wonder. Oh, ye stern-browed oaks, That raise your giant arms on all the scene, How like your parent Druids ye appear! Lonely, severe and in your grandeur dark, Your fearful shades, like superstitious night, Fall on the awe-struck spirit!— Steadfast ye stand, and ever silent, save Unto the potent, unknown winds, that shake Your grey tops, when a voice of plaint is heard. The traveller, listening this, at even-tide, Thinks 'tis the voice of one departed hence, Prophet of evil, warning him of death! Then to his fancy lours, with deeper gloom, The cloud, which sheds a pale and ghastly light Upon the woods. He pauses oft, and back Through the long forest-glades marks the last gleam The sun has left, far in the lonely West; While shapes uncertain seem to glide athwart The twilight vista, and approach his path; The hollow murmur swells upon his ear! And, shuddering then, he takes his onward way. How oft, ye Druid oaks!— Your voice has sounded, in a distant age, To him, who hears no more; and now it speaks In the same tone to him, who then was not— The passing traveller of the living hour! Thus, ever and anon, it sounds the knell Of fleeting, swift mortality! ON THE RONDEAU, “JUST LIKE LOVE IS YONDER ROSE.” No, ah! no; not just like love, Is yon gay and conscious rose; All its flaunting leaves disclose Sun-shine joy—and fearless prove; Not like love! But yonder little violet-flower, That, folded in its purple veil, And trembling to the lightest gale, Weeps beneath that shadowing bower, Is just like love! Though filled with dew its closing eyes, Though bends its slender stem in air, It breathes perfume and blossoms fair, It feeds on tears, and lives on sighs, Just like love! And should a sun-beam kiss its leaf, How bright the dew-drops would appear! Like beams of hope upon a tear, Like light of smiles through parting grief! And just like love! DECEMBER'S EVE, ABROAD. Awful is Winter's setting sun, When, from beneath a sullen cloud, He eyes his dreary course now run, And shrinks within his lurid shroud— Leaving to Twilight's cold, grey sky Yon Minster's dark and lonely tower, That seems to shun the searching eye, And vanish with the parting hour. Dim is the long roof's sloping line, Whose airy pinnacles I trace, Point over point, and o'er the shrine And eastern window's gothic grace. While loud the winds, in chorus clear, Swell, or in sinking murmurs grieve, The Ministers of Night I hear In requiem o'er December's Eve. Wide o'er the plains and distant wolds I see her pall of darkness flow; And all around, in mighty folds, Her winding sheet of new-fallen snow. Farewell December's dismal night! Appalled I hear thy shrieking breath; And view, aghast, by glimmering light, Thy visage, terrible in death! Farewell December's dismal night! DECEMBER'S EVE, AT HOME. Welcome December's cheerful night, When the taper-lights appear; When the piled hearth blazes bright, And those we love are circled there! And, on the soft rug basking lies, Outstretched at ease, the spotted friend, With glowing coat and half-shut eyes, Where watchfulness and slumber blend. Welcome December's cheerful hour, When books, with converse sweet combined, And music's many-gifted power Exalt, or soothe th' awakened mind. Then, let the snow-wind shriek aloud, And menace oft the guarded sash, And all his diapason crowd, As o'er the frame his white wings dash. He sings of darkness and of storm, Of icy cold, and lonely ways; But, gay the room, the hearth more warm, And brighter is the taper's blaze. Then, let the merry tale go round, And airy songs the hours deceive; And let our heart-felt laughs resound, In welcome to December's Eve! A SEA-VIEW. A breeze is springing up. Mark yon grey cloud, That from th' horizon piles it's Alpy steeps Upon the sky; there the fierce tempest rides. Our vessel owns the gale, and all her sails Are full; the broad and slanted deck cuts with i edge The foaming waves, that roll almost within it, And often bow their curling tops, as if In homage. Not so the onward billows; For while, with steady force, the vexing prow Flings wide the groaning waters, high rise they, Darting their dragon-headed vengeance: now Baffled they burst on either side with rage, And dash their spray in the hard seaman's face. The gale is rising: and the roughening waves Show darker shades of green, with, here and there, Far out, white foamy tops, that rise and fall Incessant. Storm-lights, issuing from the clouds, Mark distances upon the mighty deep; There, in one gleam, a white sail scuds along— Farther, those vessels seem to hang in shade; And, farther still, on the last edge of ocean, Where falls a paler, mistier sun-light, See where some port-town peeps above the tide, With its long, level ramparts, turret-crowned; There a broad tower and there a slender spire Stand high upon the light, while all between, Of intermingled roofs, embattled gates, Quays, ancient halls and smoking chimneys,—sunk Low, and all blended in one common mass, Are undiscerned so far. There, all is calm; The waters slumber; the anchored keels repose; And not a top-mast trembles;— While here the chafing billows mount the deck Dash through the sturdy shrouds, and with their foam Buffet the braced sail. Toward that port Our vessel steers, which from the seas and winds May soon receive us.— But ah! while yet we gaze, the vision fades! The high-piled ramparts, overtopped with turrets, Vanish in shade before the searching eye, Which nought but waves and sky can trace o'er all The lone horizon! So on Calabria's shore, Where the old Reggio spreads its walls Beside the sea, the fairy's wand, at eve, Is lifted—and behold! far on the waters, Another landscape rise! This phænomenon is noticed in Swinburne's Travels in the Two Sicilies. The people of Reggio attribute it, all natural as it is, to the fairy Morgana, and run with shouts to the shore, to witness her wonders. Wood-mantled steeps And shadowy mountains soar, and turrets from Some promontory's point hang o'er the vale, Where sleeps among its palms the hamlet low, Hid from the bustling, ostentatious world, Deep in the bosom of this silent scene. Ah! beauteous work of Fairie! that can paint Unreal visions to th' admiring eye, Charming it with distinct, though faithless forms. The magic sceptre dropt, behold, they vanish! A desert world of water's only there! And thus th' enchantress on the daily path Of Youth attends, known only by her power Unseen, and conjures up Hope, Joy and Bliss, To dance in the fresh bowers of fadeless spring. At Reason's touch the airy dream dissolves; We gaze, and wonder at such wild delusion, Yet weep its loss, and court its forms again. Hail, beauteous scenes of Fairie, Fancy's world! Where Truth, so cold and colourless, comes not, Or far away in lonely grandeur stands, Like the great snowy Alps, whose cloudy shapes And aspect stern (deforming the horizon), Make the still landscape, spread below, appear More green, more gay, more cheering to our view. Hail, beauteous scenes of Fairie, Fancy's world! And now, as if the spell had worked again, The stormy shade far distant floats away. Again the spired city shines in light, Peering beyond the waves, here shadowed yet By the lingering storm. The pier outstretches Its arm to meet us, and the light-house shows Its column, and we see the lanthorn high, Suspended o'er the margin of the tide, The star of the night-wandering mariner. Hail, cheering port, first vision of the land, Vision, but not illusion, hail again! ON HAYLEY'S LIFE OF COWPER. Oh speak no more of Fiction's painted woes! Her laboured scenes are colourless and cold; Her high-wrought sorrows are but dull repose, Beside the tale that simple Truth has told. O'er the sad Poet dead shall Pity weep, Weep tears of anguish, such as mothers shed O'er the poor infant, when its paling lip Moves with a last faint smile; when droops the head, And the imploring eyes look up once more To her, whose fondness can no aid dispense! 'Tis well there is a Higher World, where soar The accepted hopes of suffering Innocence! WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT. Oh! for a cottage on the shady brow Of this green Island, where the Channel flows With less tumultuous wave, and sends abroad The many sails of England to the world, And beareth to his home the mariner, Who shouts to view the light blue hills, that dawn O'er Wight's gay plains; and soon he spies the woods, That shade its shores, and brighter tints of corn And pastoral slopes and all their “green delights.” Advancing gently, 'mid the sleepy tide, Soon he marks some long-left object clear, A lofty watch-tower, or some village church, Or the white parsonage peeping through the trees, To which, when last beheld, he sighed farewell With throbbing grief.—These now he hails with joy, As he steers onward to the well-known shore. Oh! for a cottage on the breezy cliff, That points the crescent of thy harbour, Cowes! And bears the raptured glance o'er seas and shores— A boundless prospect, tinted all around With summer shades of soft ethereal blue!— O'er the wide waters rise the far-famed downs Of Sussex; while thy forests, Hampshire, vast, Spread their dark line, for many a winding mile, By the blue waves, till, failing, the sight rests Where yon dim hill-tops overlook the main. There Purbeck's summits rise, while broader hills, Marking their grey lines on the forest shade, Lead back the eye to where Southampton's vale Pours forth th' abundant wave, and spreads its lawns, Its jutting slopes, with villas gaily crowned, Its sheltered cots, the rough wood's shade, whence peers The village fane 'mid the high foliage:— Southampton's vale, where lurks the twilight glade, Whose ancient oaks their branches stretch austere, And half conceal that Abbey's fretted arch, As if to guard from eye and hand profane The mouldering stones, whose pious founder once Dropped them, green acorns, in this hallowed ground, To shelter and adorn the sainted walls, Whose long-forgotten sons mused 'neath their shade, Blest thoughts of sure Eternity; and now Leave here all that was mortal of themselves. Oh! reverence this ground; for it is holy, Sacred to pious thought; for worldly grace By the high-gifted poet often praised. Here winged steps have passed, and brightest thoughts, Creative as the sun-beam, have up-flown. Here pensive Gray some sad sweet moments passed, And breathed a spell that saved these falling walls; There walks that solemn vision “In the bosom of the woods (concealed from profane eyes) lie the ruins of Nettley Abbey; there may be richer and greater houses, but the abbot is content with his situation. See there, at the top of that hanging meadow, under the shade of those old trees that bend into a half circle about it, he is walking slowly, and bidding his beads for the souls of his benefactors, interred in that venerable pile, that lies beneath him.” Letter of Mr. Gray to Mr. Nichols, Nov. 19, 1764.—Mason's Life of Gray, p. 381., telling his beads; Where 'neath the leafy gloom, the Poet's glance Espied him! Still athwart yon vista dark Shoots the white sail; still in the sun the waves Glitter, as when Gray's musing abbot viewed them, Measuring the moments with his pangs. Oh! pause Awhile, and shed a melancholy tear To the departed shade of him, who sung “The paths of glory lead but to the grave:” Weep o'er the memory of that wondrous Bard, That master of the song, whose full-toned harp Called round him loftiest themes of Fantasy, Whose voice, rolling on the midnight thunder, Waked sublimest awe; or played in cadence, While the Graces danced; or, still oftener, mourned O'er mortal doom and life's brief vanities, While early youth and all the train of joy Would leave their sports, listening the strain that bade Them woo the languishments of Melancholy. Farewell! thou mighty master, who, with high Disdain of vulgar fame, “knew thine own worth And reverenced the lyre,” and kept thy still Footstep far away from the thronged path and Vanity's dull round. Farewell! thou doff'st Thy mortal weeds, and the same strain sublime, That moralized th' unstoried lives and deaths Of villagers, is oft repeated o'er thy grave, With faltering voice, by those, who walk thy path From Eton's shades to Stoke, and view the scene That filled thy youthful eye and charmed thy mind— Where, years ago, thy “careless childhood strayed, A stranger yet to pain.”— Now let us leave the vale, thus dedicate To memory, sweet and melancholy, And trace the landscape o'er yon chalky ridge To Portsdown, shielding in its concave all That tract of greyer land, that banks the sea. On the low point extends the busy port, Its forts and ramparts rising o'er the main, And wide o'erlooking all its anchored fleets. Oh! for the magic pencil of Lorraine! To give the soft perspective, where the waves Fade to thin air in tints of mildest blue, And the dark masts and cobweb-shrouds and lines Of spiry shipping trace themselves in light. Midway the sails of various vessels swell, Gliding their silent course; here the swift-winged Slant cutter skims the sea; and there the skiff, Low on the mighty waters, shows a speck, Invisible, but that its tiny sail Catches the sunbeam, and, wondrous! tells that Human life dwells in the moving atom Amidst the waters. While we gaze, each wave Threatens to whelm it; and the shores appear Too distant for its small and feeble wing; Yet on it goes in safety, and displays Regular purpose, well-considered rules, And skill, which guides its weakness through the strength Of waves, o'er pathless distance, to the sheltering port. Oh! that the old Spirit of Song Would sound his harp from this high aery brow, And bid its sweet tones languish, till the Nymphs, That dwell beneath its waves, wake at the strain, And send up answering music, now scarce heard, Now lost, now heard again with wondering doubt, Till, rising slow, a clearer chorus swells In the soft gale, and makes its voice its own: Then, the full sounds float over woods and rocks; And then, descending on the wave, retire, Die with the 'plaining of the distant tide, And leave a blessed peace o'er all the soul. Raise such a strain, O Nymphs! whose spell may spread A sweeter grace on all the eye beholds, That the fine vision of these seas and shores May paint their living colours on the mind, With charm so forceful, as Time cannot fade. Then Memory with their own truth shall give The blue shades of the main, under these dark And waving boughs upon the steep; the mast Now seen, or lost, in the smooth bay, as choose The dancing leaves; the grey fort on the strand, Its low, round tower o'ercanopied with elms, The pacing sentinel, beneath their gloom, Safe from the noon-day sun. Then would she paint The slopes, that swell beside thy harbour, Cowes, With pasture gay and oft with groves embrowned, That amid veiling leaves, half show the villa, Gay mimic of a cottage, or the trim crest Of some proud castle, falsely old. Thy town Would still be seen to climb the craggy bank; Thy vale, withdrawing from the sunny bay, Would wind beneath these green hills' shade, where droops The sail becalmed, that on Medina's tide Bears the full freight to Newport. Memory then Would give these nearer scenes of gentle beauty, Those spreading waters and the dim-seen coast, Fading into the sky. Then, gentle Nymphs, Borne far upon the winds, my song might tell Of your sweet haunts, perchance in Indian seas— Of them, who dance before the rising sun, With songs of joyance breathing spicy gales. Methinks, I hear their far-off notes complain: “Oh! ne'er yet tripp'd we on the yellow sands, That Fame says base the cliffs of English land; Never yet danced we on those heights, that send Airs from their mantling woods; never yet trod The ridges of her stormy waves, nor watched The tender azure melt into the green, Then deepen to the purple's changing shades, Beneath the sleepy indolence of noon. For such delights we'll leave our splendid clime, Our groves of cassia and our coral bowers, Our diamond-beaming caves and golden beds, 'Broidered with rubies, with transparent pearl, And emeralds, that steal the sea-wave's hue, And shells of rainbow-tint, fairy pavilions: All but our tortoise cars; they shall bear us O'er many a curling surge and chasm deep, Farther than where the blended sea and sky Hide from our sight the cooler, better oceans. That way seek we those temperate islands, now Wearing green Neptune's livery, crowned with oak, And terraced with bright cliffs; such Oberon, The fairy, told of, to win our music. 'Twas a charmful moon-time, and he perched him In a purple shell, he called his mantle, And basked him in the pure light, and then asked A lullaby to soothe his care, for he Was sad and weary, and had, all the day, Toiled on a north-beam; and now Titania, For whom he sought, had left the spicy steeps Of India, on a bat's wing, at twilight. We asked a story of the northern clime To pay our melody, and I remember It told of castles moving on the waves, Of a soft emerald throne upon an isle, Beyond the falling sun, and other wonders, That we, all night, could well have listened him, But that he craved our pity and our song. On that we breathed a soul into our shells, And charmed him into slumber!” SONNET TO THE LARK. Sweet lark! I hear thy thrilling note on high, The note of rapture, that thy bosom pours To Spring's fresh gales, green plains and azure sky, As o'er the mountains steal Morn's blushing hours. With silent step they come and meekened grace, In twilight's veil half-hid from mortal view, Wafting rich fragrance through the crystal space, O'er groves and valleys shedding April dew. Gay bird! now all the woods in silence sleep, How sweet thy music comes upon the air, And dies at distance, as, up heaven's blue steep, Thou, lessening, soar'st to meet Aurora's star! Oh! bird of hope and joy, thou point'st the way That I would go—high o'er life's cloudy day! ON READING THE FOLLOWING BEAUTIFUL LINES, WRITTEN BY THE LATE LADY ELIZABETH LEE, SISTER OF EARL HARCOURT, IN A BOWER CALLED BY HER NAME, AT ST. LEONARD'S HILL, THE SEAT OF THE EARL, IN WINDSOR FOREST; A SEAT WHICH STRANGERS ARE SOMETIMES PERMITTED TO VIEW. “This peaceful shade—this green-roofed bower, Great Maker! all are full of Thee; Thine is the bloom, that decks the flower, And Thine the fruit, that bends the tree. As much Creative Goodness charms In these low shrubs, that humbly creep, As in the oak, whose giant-arms Wave o'er the high romantic steep. The bower, the shade, retired, serene, The grateful heart may most affect; Here, God in every leaf is seen, And man has leisure to reflect! “And I too was once of Arcadia.” From this high lawn, beneath the varied green Of grove and bower, dark oak and blossomed shade, How brightly spreads the vale! how grand the scene Of forest woods and towers, that lift the head Majestic from the strife of ages past! And seem to view, with melancholy smile, The gloom of thought by solemn Pity cast On the world, fleeting to its rest;—the while The fleeting world, all various and gay, Sports in those villas and those hamlets free, Where stretching tints of ripened harvest play Among dark woods and meads of Arcady. There Spires of Peace arise, and straw-roofed farm By village green, from 'mid it's antient grove Sends the high curling smoke, renowned charm Of those, who watch how lights and shadows rove. Embattled Windsor, throned upon the vale, Beneath these boughs displays its bannered state; And learned Eton, o'er its willows pale, Looks stern and sad, as mourning Henry's fate. On this high lawn, where Nature's wealth we view, All is instinct with life and fine delight! Trees of all shades, the flowers of every hue, Shrubs breathing joy The delicious fragrance of the mangolia, which flourishes in great abundance before the colonnade, fills the breakfast-room, and scents all the upper part of the lawn. Its bushes are wide and high, its egg-flowers large, and its foliage broad and glossy, like a bay-leaf. and blooming on the sight. Here bliss may dwell, and never, never die! Vain thought! in that low bower there seems a voice, Breathed, soft as summer winds o'er waters sigh, “I once, like you, could in this scene rejoice. This was my bower of bliss! Approach and read!” It sunk, that solemn sound, and died on air. Within the cell I passed with reverend dread, And found the angel-spirit still was there. Still in “that green-roofed bower,” that “peaceful shade,” Whose changeful prospect seems for ever new, The pomp of forests stretching till they fade, And sleep in softness on the distant blue.— Still in that fine repose—that once-loved bower, Breathe thoughts of heavenly mind, that speak of God! And tell a heart, which, grateful, owned His power In every leaf, that paints the humble sod. Fast fell my tears, as flowed with her's my thought, The living feeling with the voice of Death! The glowing joy by Nature's beauty wrought With proof how transient is even rapture's breath. Here in this shade she sat! fast fell my tears; When my sad mind a hushing music won; Again mild accents seemed to soothe my fears, And murmur, “Grieve not that her race is run! The pious heart, the comprehensive mind, These were of Heaven, and are to Heaven returned!” It was a seraph's voice upon the wind; I heard her song of joy; I heard! nor longer mourned. TO THE RIVER DOVE. Oh! stream beloved by those, With Fancy who repose, And court her dreams 'mid scenes sublimely wild, Lulled by the summer-breeze, Among the drowsy trees Of thy high steeps, and by thy murmurs mild, My lonely footsteps guide, Where thy blue waters glide, Fringed with the Alpine shrub and willow light; 'Mid rocks and mountains rude, Here hung with shaggy wood, And there upreared in points of frantic height. Beneath their awful gloom, Oh! blue-eyed Nymph, resume The mystic spell, that wakes the poet's soul! While all thy caves around In lonely murmur sound, And feeble thunders o'er these summits roll. O shift the wizard scene To banks of pastoral green When mellow sun-set lights up all thy vales; And shows each turf-born flower, That, sparkling from the shower, Its recent fragrance on the air exhales. When Evening's distant hues Their silent grace diffuse In sleepy azure o'er the mountain's head; Or dawn in purple faint, As nearer cliffs they paint, Then lead me 'mid thy slopes and woodland shade. Nor would I wander far, When Twilight lends her star, And o'er thy scenes her doubtful shades repose; Nor when the Moon's first light Steals on each bowery height, Like the winged music o'er the folded rose. Then, on thy winding shore, The fays and elves, once more, Trip in gay ringlets to the reed's light note; Some launch the acorn's ring, Their sail—Papilio's wing, Thus shipped, in chace of moon-beams, gay they float. But, at the midnight hour, I woo thy thrilling power, While silent moves the glow-worm's light along, And o'er the dim hill-tops The gloomy red moon drops, And in the grave of darkness leaves thee long. Even then thy waves I hear, And own a nameless fear, As, 'mid the stillness, the night winds do swell, Or (faint from distance) hark To the lone watch-dog's bark! Answering a melancholy far sheep bell. O! Nymph fain would I trace Thy sweet awakening grace, When summer dawn first breaks upon thy stream; And see thee braid thy hair; And keep thee ever there, Like thought recovered from an antique dream! THE SEA-MEW. Forth from her cliffs sublime the sea-mew goes To meet the storm, rejoicing! To the woods She gives herself; and, borne above the peaks Of highest head-lands, wheels among the clouds, And hears Death's voice in thunder roll around, While the waves far below, driven on the shore, Foaming with pride and rage, make hollow moan. Now, tossed along the gale from cloud to cloud, She turns her silver wings touched by the beam, That through a night of vapours darts its long, Level line; and, vanishing 'mid the gloom, Enters the secret region of the storm; But soon again appearing, forth she moves Out from the mount'nous shapes of other clouds, And, sweeping down them, hastens to new joys. It was the wailing of the deep she heard! No fears repel her: when the tumult swells, Ev'n as the spirit-stirring trumpet glads The neighing war-horse, is the sound to her. O'er the waves hovering, while they lash the rocks, And lift, as though to reach her, their chafed tops, Dashing the salt foam o'er her downy wings, Higher she mounts, and from her feathers shakes The shower, triumphant. As they sink, she sinks, And with her long plumes sweeps them in their fall, As if in mockery; then, as they retreat, She dances o'er them, and with her shrill note Dares them, as in scorn. It is not thus she meets their summer smiles; Then, skimming low along the level tide, She dips the last point of her crescent wings, At measured intervals, with playful grace, And rises, as retreating to her home. High on yon 'pending rock, but poised awhile In air, as though enamoured of the scene, She drops, at once, and settles on the sea. On the green waves, transparent then she rides, And breathes their freshness, trims her plumage white, And, listening to the murmur of the surge, Doth let them bear her wheresoe'er they will. Oh! bird beloved of him, who, absent long From his dear native land, espies thee ere The mountain tops o'er the far waters rise, And hails thee as the harbinger of home! Thou bear'st to him a welcome on thy wings. His white sail o'er th' horizon thou hast seen And hailed it, with thy oft-repeated cry, Announcing England. “England is near!” he cries, And every seaman's heart an echo beats, And “England—England!” sounds along the deck, Mounts to the shrouds, and finds an answering voice, Ev'n at the top-mast head, where, posted long, The “look out” sailor clings, and with keen eye, By long experience finely judging made, Reads the dim characters of air-veiled shores. O happy bird! whom Nature's changing scenes Can ever please; who mount'st upon the wind Of Winter and amid the grandeur soar'st Of tempests, or sinkest to the peaceful deep, And float'st with sunshine on the summer calm! O happy bird! lend me thy pinions now. Thy joys are mine, and I, like thee, would skim Along the pleasant curve of the salt bays, Where the blue seas do now serenely sleep; Or, when they waken to the Evening breeze, And every crisping wave reflects her tints Of rose and amber,—like thee, too, would I Over the mouths of the sea-rivers float, Or watch, majestic, on the tranquil tide, The proud ships follow one another down, And spread themselves upon the mighty main, Freighted for shores that shall not dawn on sight, Till a new sky uplift its burning arch, And half the globe be traversed. Then to him, The home-bound seaman, should my joyous flight Once more the rounding river point,—to him Who comes, perchance, from coasts of darkness, where Grim Ruin, from his throne of hideous rocks, O'ercanopied with pine, or giant larch, Scowls on the mariner, and Terror wild Looks through the parting gloom with ghastly eye, Listens to woods, that groan beneath the storm, And starts to see the river-cedar fall. How sweet to him, who from such strands returns, How sweet to glide along his homeward stream By well-known meads and woods and village cots, That lie in peace around the ivied spire And ancient parsonage, where the small, fresh stream Gives a safe haven to the humbler barks At anchor, just as last he viewed the scene. And soft as then upon the surface lies The sunshine, and as sweet the landscape Smiles, as on that day he sadly bade farewell To those he loved. Just so it smiles, and yet How many other days and months have fled, What shores remote his steps have wandered o'er, What scenes of various life unfolded strange, Since that dim yesterday! The present scene Unchanged, though fresh, appears the only truth, And all the interval a dream! May those He loves still live, as lives the landscape now; And may to-morrow's sun light the thin clouds Of doubt with rainbow-hues of hope and joy! Bird! I would hover with thee o'er the deck, Till a new tide with thronging ships should tremble; Then, frightened at their strife, with thee I'd fly To the free waters and the boundless skies, And drink the light of heaven and living airs; Then with thee haunt the seas and sounding shores, And dwell upon the mountain's beaked top, Where nought should come but thou and the wild winds. There would I listen, sheltered in our cell, The tempest's voice, while midnight wraps the world. But, if a moon-beam pierced the clouds, and shed Its sudden gleam upon the foaming waves, Touching with pale light each sharp line of cliff, Whose head towered darkly, which no eye could trace,— Then downward I would wheel amid the storm, And watch, with untired gaze, the embattled surges Pouring in deep array, line after line, And hear their measured war-note sound along The groaning coast, whereat the winds above Answer the summons, and each secret cave, Untrod by footsteps, and each precipice, That oft had on the unconscious fisher frowned, And every hollow bay and utmost cape Sighs forth a fear for the poor mariner. He, meanwhile, hears the sound o'er waters wide; Lashed to the mast, he hears, and thinks of home. O bird! lend me thy wings, That swifter than the blast I may out-fly Danger, and from yon port the life-boat call. And see! e'en now the guardian bark rides o'er The mountain-billows, and descends through chasms Where lurks Destruction eager for his prey, With eyes of flashing fire and foamy jaws. He, by strange storm-lights shown, uplifts his head, And, from the summit of each rising wave, Darts a grim glance upon the daring crew, And sinks the way their little boat must go! But she, with blessings armed, best shield! as if Immortal, surmounts the abyss, and rides The watery ridge upon her pliant oars, Which conquer the wild, raging element And that dark demon, with angelic power. Wave after wave, he sullenly retreats, With oft repeated menace, and beholds The poor fisherman, with all his fellows, Borne from his grasp in triumph to the shore— There Hope stands watchful, and her call is heard Wafted on wishes of the crowd. Hark! hark! Is that her voice rejoicing? 'Tis her song Swells high upon the gale, and 'tis her smile, That gladdens the thick darkness. They are saved. Bird of the winds and waves and lonely shores, Of loftiest promontories—and clouds, And tempests—Bird of the sun-beam, that seeks Thee through the storm, and glitters on thy wings! Bird of the sun-beam and the azure calm, Of the green cliff, hung with gay summer plants, Who lov'st to sit in stillness on the bough, That leans far o'er the sea, and hearest there The chasing surges and the hushing sounds, That float around thee, when tall shadows tremble, And the rock-weeds stream lightly on the breeze. O bird of joy! what wanderer of air Can vie with thee in grandeur of delights, Whose home is on the precipice, whose sport Is on the waves? O happy, happy bird! Lend me thy wings, and let thy joys be mine! TO THE WINDS. Spirit! who dwellest in the secret clouds, Unseen, unknown, yet heard o'er all the world! Who reign'st in storms and darkness half the year, Yet sometimes lov'st, in Summer's season bright, To breathe soft music through her azure dome: Oft heard art thou amongst the high tree-tops, In mournful and so sweet a melody, As though some Angel, touched with human grief, Soothed the sad mind. Oh, viewless, viewless wind! I love thy potent voice, whether in storms It gives to thunder clouds their impulse dread, Swells the Spring airs, or sighs in Autumn's groves, Mourning the dying leaf. Whate'er the note, Thy power entrances, wins me from low cares, And bears me towards God, who bids you breathe, And bids the morning of a higher world Dawn on my hopes. MOONLIGHT. A SCENE. On the bright margin of Italia's shore, Beneath the glance of summer-noon we stray, And, indolently happy, ask no more Than cooling airs, that o'er the ocean play; And watch the bark, that, on the busy strand, Washed by the sparkling tide, awaits the gale, Till, high among the shrouds, the sailor-band Gallantly shout, and raise the swelling sail. On the broad deck a various group recline, Touched with the moonlight, yet half-hid in shade, Who, silent, watch the bark the coast resign, The Pharos lessen, and the mountains fade. We, indolently happy, ask alone The wandering airs, which o'er the ocean stray, To bring some sad Venetian sonnet's tone, From that lone vessel floating far away! SMILES. I was a smile—a fleeting smile, Like a faint gleam through Autumn's shade, That softly, sweetly, did beguile, As it around her dimples played. What are smiles, and whence their sway? Smiles that, o'er the features stealing, To the gazer's heart convey All the varied world of feeling, What are smiles? Do they dwell in Beauty's eye? No! nor on her playing cheek, Nor on her wavy lip—though nigh Seems the glancing charm they seek. Where do they dwell? Where?—Their home is in the mind; Smiles are light—the light of soul! Light of many tints combined, And of strong and sure control. Smiles are light. There's a smile—the smile of Joy, Bright as glance of May's fresh morn; And one, that gleams but to destroy,— 'Tis the lightning smile of Scorn. There is a smile of glow-worm hue, That glimmers not near scenes of Folly, Pale and strange and transient too,— The smile of awful Melancholy. Like to the sad and silvery showers, Falling in an April sun, Is the smile, that Pity pours O'er the deed, that Fate has done. Dear is Friendship's meeting look, As moonlight on a sleeping vale, Soothing those the sun forsook— So does that o'er Care prevail. But who the first pure tint has seen, That trembles on the edge of Morning, When summer's veil is so serene, Hiding half and half adorning? They, who this have seen, may know, What the smile that's here intended; They, who do to Laura go, See that smile with beauty blended. THE REED OF POESY. Oh! sweet reed, come hither! Never from thee will I part; For oft, like sun-shine weather, Thy music has cheered my heart: Oh! sweet reed, come hither. Many a forest-green mountain In leafless November I've seen; Many a daisy-rimmed fountain In frozen December has been; Many an April bower, And many a valley of May Bright with sunbeam and flower, I've seen on a Winter's day. Oft, in the depth of December, When the night-blast shrieked aloud, And sadly bade me remember, That Death was abroad in his shroud; Thy welcomest note light sounding Has flattered my fears to rest; My lone, lone hearth surrounding With many a fairy guest. And many a scene of wonder, Rising from forth the dark night, In veil thrown but half asunder, Has thrilled me with dread delight. How oft, in some measureless chamber, I have seen the traveller wait, Through the dull night of December, All fearful of some sad fate. And I've heard that voice so hollow Break once on his startled ear; And seen him how sadly follow, And dimly disappear. And, when the grey doubtful morning Has gleamed pale over the waste, I've viewed him all safe returning, And smiling at danger past. So come, sweet reed, come hither! I never from thee will part; For oft, like sunshine weather, Thy music has cheered my heart. Oh! sweet reed, come hither! EDWY. A POEM, IN THREE PARTS. PART I. THE HAZEL TREE. A SUMMER SONG OF FAIRIE. Lightly green with springing buds, The hazel twines her fairy bowers, In yon dell o'erhung with woods, Where the brook its music pours. O'er the margin of the stream Peeps the yellow marygold, And lilies, where the waters gleam, Bend their heads so fair and cold. Know ye why the Elfin-band Watch beneath the hazel-bough? 'Tis to guard its Magic Wand And its blossoms, as they blow. These, gathered at the mid-day hour, To mortal eyes their haunts betray; That has the strange enchanting power To call up a prophetic Fay. Be she down among the rills, In some wild-wood dingle hid; Or dancing on the moonlight hills— She must speed, as she is bid. Or sleep she on the mossy bed, Under the blossom-breathing lime, That sheds sweet freshness over head— The freshness of the morning prime; Or stray she with old Thames serene Through osier-tufts and lofty groves, By royal towers, or cottaged green, Still must she leave what best she loves— Leave the thatched cot, where finest spreads The Princess Elizabeth's late cottage at Old Windsor. The turf, 'mid every choicest flower, And the far-branching chestnut sheds Over the wave its greenest shower. Where, silver-streak'd, that polished wave Glides by with lingering, sweet farewell, While stately swans their proud necks lave, And seem to feel some fairy spell. Then marvel not that Elfins fair Guard the thin wand and hazel bloom; Since these can all their haunts lay bare, By hidden stream, or forest gloom. —Near Windsor's shades there dwelt a youth, Who fast was bound in Cupid's chain; But how to try his lady's truth By mortal means he sought in vain. He to a chamber dim withdrew, Where serpent's skin and head of toad Hinted of themes he must pursue, Ere secret would to him be showed. It was a chamber magical, Where light in partial gleams appeared, And showed strange shapes upon the wall, By his own mystic learning reared. Thence to the hazel-copse he went, When the sun was flaming high; And there the twining branches rent; For then no Fay was watching nigh. Fast asleep in closed flowers, And all unheard, and all unseen, Who, that walked these noontide bowers, Could guess that any Elves had been?— Next, to the forest-hills he hied, To pull the wild thyme's budding bloom, Fresh from some haunted dingle's side; For, it must blow where Fairies come. Just such a dingle still is seen, Hanging upon the Park's high brow, Deep buried in the shadowy green, Where tall o'erarching beeches grow. Here oft the Fairies revel keep, To bless the Castle's moonlight hours, And peep, as winds these branches sweep, At Windsor diadem'd with towers. Grass, that crowns a Fairie's throne, Marygolds—her canopy, Lilies, for her cradle known, These he gathered, three and three. Well prepared with hazel-leaves, Thus the wondrous charm distill, Which, laid on an eye, that grieves, Shows each sprite of grove, or rill. “Three hazel-wands peel smooth and white, Just a twelvemonth old—no more: Thrice on each wand the full name write Of the Fay you would implore. “Then in earth these wands consign; In earth, that elfin footsteps tread, Extract them with well-muttered line, Unheard of man—by man unread. “Next, to the North your visage turn, Invoke her name, with thrice told three, Be she by forest, mead, or bourne, Her on your magic glass you'll see.” With shaking hand he peeled the wand; Then would he trace her name, I wot; Edwy the Love-Fay would command; But Edwy had her name forgot. Full of great flaws to aught but love Is the memory of a lover; Now he must watch where Fairies rove, Or this name he'll ne'er recover. Back o'er the sunny hills he goes To his green home in Windsor shades, To draw the charm, that shall expose The Elfin-Court, when day-light fades. Down by good Clewer's winding mead, And where the silver currents glide, A plume of elms lifts high it's head, And casts it's shadow on the tide. All dark and still the feathery grove Sleeps in the streamy light below; The streamy light with placid love And hushing murmur seems to flow. There Elves, 'twas said, in ringlets went, When chimes sang midnight to the land, If then, on Windsor's battlement, Tip-toe the full-orbed Moon should stand. Duly distilled the flowery charm, Thither Edway must repair, And, that no check the spell might harm, Ere the sun-set he was there. The golden tints of Evening lie Upon the smoothly-flowing stream, Tint the old walls and turrets high, And lower on the wood-tops gleam. And, slanting o'er the willowed vale, The blessed Henry's fane enshrined, It's fretted windows, turrets pale, And pinnacles far ranged behind. And now the soothing hour is come, The star-light hour, when all is still, Save the far-distant village hum, And the lone watch-bark from the hill; And wheels which, far-off travelling, Pass unseen in bowery lane, Like to the sea-tide murmuring, Now loud and lost, then loud again. He laid the charm upon his eyes, And looked with desperate courage round; Alas! no tripping phantoms rise On the shadowy, Fairie ground. Patience is a lover's duty! Here, counting every distant chime, He exalts his lady's beauty, In quaint, or pity-moving rhime. Till, in the East, a shadowy light, Rising behind the Castle-walls, Gives the dim turrets to his sight, And in mute watch his spirit thralls. As slow the unseen Moon ascends, More darkly drawn the towers appear, Till every doubtful mass expands, And lives upon the radiant air; Then, peers she o'er the broad Keep's height, A spreading curve of light serene; And, faithful to her loved Midnight, There, reigns it's pale and pensive Queen. And touches, with her silver ray, Terrace and woody steep below The river's willow-sheltered bay, And waters quivering as they flow. Where'er th' Enchantress points her wand, Forth from the deep of darkness crowd Pale glimmering shapes, and silent stand As waked from Death's unfolding shroud. The landscape lived, clear spread the lawn The groves their shadowy tops unfurled, And airy hills in prospect dawn, Like vision of another world. The chimes sang midnight; Edwy shook, While by the grove of elm he stood, And cast a sly and wistful look Around the turf and o'er the flood. That wrinkled flood, all silver bright, No sail of Fairie pinnace showed, Nor, 'neath the still elm's bowery night, A glimpse of elfin-pageant glowed. St. George's chimes, with falter sweet, Like infants, tried their task to say; But, waked from midnight's slumber meet, Th' imperfect accents died away. And soft they sunk to sleep again, Ere the slow song was duly closed, As seeming feebly to complain Of broken rest, e'en while they dozed. But Fairies met not Edwy's eye; For, here, alas! no more they rove; Some urchins of the College nigh Had surely scared them from the grove; Such as the forest-keepers here Have followed, helter-skelter, round Hills, woods and dales, for tracking deer; Till fond Thames bore the wights to ground; To Eton ground, where, safe from law, And praising oft the helping tide, They peeped, well hid in grass, and saw The foresters on t'other side! Such as the May-pole A Maypole formerly stood on the Green, before the gates of the Long Walk at Windsor, where pranks of this sort have often been played. oft has watched Doff gown and mount the coach on high; Such as the tavern-dinner snatched, The bottle drank and ate the pie, In fifteen minutes and away! And, if an oxen-herd they met, Sprung on their horns, in laughing play, Then gravely joined the school-room set. Oh! those were happy times, I ween, The light of Morning o'er the sky— That touches all the varied scene With life-full gleams of hope and joy. The angered fairies, in revenge, Still, the tale goes, “their tyrants flout;” Plunge them in scrapes and mischief strange, Then leave them to a flogging-bout! But oft good Robin proves their friend, And lays his bandage on the eyes Of the grave Heads, who mildly blend Remembrance with severe surmise. And now, in more removed ground, Up in the high Park's ancient shade, On the grey forest's lonely bound, These fairies dance in secret glade; Where oaks Plantagenet still frown, Great Edward's tree e'en each appears, A warlike ruin, gaunt and lone, The spectre of five hundred years. Nursed by long centuries gone by, Reared in the storms, that wrecked their kings, Oh! could they give the Past a sigh, And speak the tale of vanished things, The peopled scenes they have beheld, In long succession, varied guise, More wonders here had stood revealed, Than aught, that Fairie dream supplies. Thus Edwy, with a face of rue, Returned home for future feat; Thus he, who does adventure woo, Must sometimes disappointment meet. PART II. THE FAIRIE COURT. A SUMMER'S NIGHT IN WINDSOR PARK. Edwy, in his lonely chamber, Plying still his magic lore, Watched, when all was hushed in slumber, The dead planetary hour. Two crystal planes, three inches square, Steeped in the blood of milk-white fowl, With careful skill he did prepare, 'Gainst next should hoot the midnight owl. One would reveal the summoned Fay, Who, by her-divining art Should on the second plane display Scenes to grieve, or cheer, his heart. Thus endowed to conjure fairie, He would fain have conjured sleep, But the god of lovers, wary, Hovers not o'er eyes that weep. Sad and restless all the morning, Sad and restless all the noon, Counting every chime of warning Through the longest day of June: Thus he lingered, thus he wandered, Round about his lady's hall, Till his hopes were nearly foundered— Till a rival spoke his fall. In an oriel he saw her, Chatting, smiling, blooming gay; Doating, maddening, he bewailed her, Doubting his first doubts this day. Breathing lilacs after showers, Bending with the silver drops, Greenest leaves and purple flowers, Waving where the goldfinch hops, And scattering round the scented dew, And sparkling on the sunny air, Not half so fresh as Aura glow, Not half so graceful—half so fair. Too soon she vanished from his eyes, And Evening summoned him afar, Then to the high-browed Park he hies; There, must he meet the twilight-star. With magic mirrors, hazel wand, Eyelids touched with clearing spell, He sought the Court of fairie land, Hidden in their distant dell. Through the shaded walks so wide, That climb about the southern hill, Edwy passed with rapid stride. Nor saw one Elf—though all was still. With toil he gained the airy brow, And, panting, paused to breathe awhile, And throw a lingering look below O'er the still landscape's parting smile. Crowning the long vista's shade, O'ertopped with turrets, terraced high, Windsor all its pomp displayed, Beneath the glowing western sky. Beyond, the low, blue hills repose, Along the far horizon's bound. How soft the hues the forest throws, Its leafy darkness shedding round! Those hills their stretching woods display In faint shade, through the azure veil, While, sweetly bright, the setting ray Bids many a spire once more—farewell. And farewell to the banner proud, That o'er the broad Keep floats on air, Proclaiming, as with trumpet loud, It's royal lord reposes there. Pale and more pale the scene retires, And Windsor's state has vanished now, Save one dim tower, that boldly spires To meet the star on twilight's brow. There stood he tranced, till, in the air, Warbled music passed along; So softly sweet, so finely clear! This was sure a Fairie song. For, now no woodlark waked to sing; Every little eye was closed; On slender foot, with drooping wing, In it's home each bird reposed. Save one, and, where he winged his way, Pleased, Edwy heard his strain advance, On his smooth neck a Fairie lay, Or rather did a Fairie dance. A veil of gossamer she wore, All spangled round with primrose dew; A star-beam for a wand she bore, Which she from Venus slyly drew. This little bird on circling pinions Wantoned over Edwy's head, Then to its shady, loved dominions, With its Fairie Lady sped. The while his Fairie Lady trills “To the beech-woods follow me, Up the lawns and o'er the hills, To the high woods follow me.” In tiny echoes “Follow me” All the hills and glades prolong; From every bush and hollow tree Seemed to rise the choral song. And Edwy, round each hollow tree, Spied the motley Elves at play; While, thick as emmets, “Follow me,” They sang again, and passed away. O'er greenest lawns, through proudest groves, He pursued his feathered guide, O'er scenes, that silent Moonlight loves, To the long lake's mossy side. The little bird flew o'er the lake; Edwy round the turf-banks went, Close where the silver currents break, And lower oaks their branches bent. The stream is there with rocks inlaid; He tripped o'er these, and reached the road, That, broad and turfy 'neath the shade, Leads to the pleasantest abode. Green above green, of every hue, The bordering trees in vista bend, The beautiful lodge at Sandpit Gate opening from the Western side of the Great Park. The scenery about this is of exceeding beauty and sweet repose. Shrubs lay their low leaves on the dew, And pine and larch on light ascend. Galleries of verdure! all is green, Here lawn and bending boughs below; Above 'tis stately shade; the scene Seems made for glancing, Fairie show. But, closer bowered, their noonday haunt Rests in a hollow, beechen dell; It's marge no human hand could plant, It's shadows seem to breathe a spell. Now, would you view the Fairies' scene, Where twilight-dances print the lawn, Where it spreads out in softest green, To gaps, whence distant landscapes dawn, Hie to the western forest-gate; There Claudian beauty melts around; There Elfin-turrets keep their state, And tell, at once, 'tis Fairie ground. Or, at that later Evening-hour; When the turf gladdens with the dew, That almost darkens Windsor's tower, And gives near hills a distant blue. And oh! if Silence could be seen, Thus would she look, so meek, so pale, The image of this very scene, When Evening glances on the vale. Now Edwy reached the wood-walks wild, The beautiful turf-walks, that branch from the Virginia Water, exhibit, perhaps, every known variety of pine and fir on their long, sweeping borders. Their stately forms and the variety of their tints, intermixed, at intervals, with lofty oak and beech, and so closely bowered below with flowering shrubs, that scarcely a spot of earth is visible beneath them, make these broad, green alleys as delightful, when closely viewed, as they are otherwise graceful from their general aspect. That open from the watery glade, Where sweet vale-lilies, violets mild, And primrose tufts the grass inlaid. Climbing the spiky blades and stems, Gathering dews, were Elves a million, Diamond drops and crystal gems, To fringe their Fairie Queen's pavilion. And see what flaming lights appear! Flashed through the foliage arching high; What silver horn winds, sweet and clear, As breathing from the lips of Joy! Sudden the elves, on flower and blade, Forsake their task, and, with a bound, Touch the green turf, and down the glade Take hands and trip a welcome round. But Edwy hears no more the strain Of his fleeting, tiny lady, And watches for her bird, in vain, To lead him through the alleys shady. By him an elfin-courier speeds On grasshopper his forest-ways; Brushing the humble cowslip heads, While each its trembling homage pays. And next, a winged beetle came, Sounding deep his herald-horn, The fairy sovereign to proclaim, And evil sprites away to warn. There, whisked an Indian lanthorn-fly Quick flashing forth it's emerald sheen; Dancing low and dancing high, In many a ring of fiery green. Then came a creeping, stilly breeze, That made the crisped waters live, That shivered all the sleeping trees, And bade the leaves their essence give. But see, the birds on every bough Awake and stretch their ruffled wings; And o'er the dewy turf below His starry glance the glow-worm flings; And the whole woodbank's flowery couch Is sprinkled now with glimmering bands, Waiting their tiny Queen's approach, Her guards and lights to Fairie lands. Again, that horn of Joy breathes fine, Again, the moonlight-light waters shake; Where'er the foaming tips combine, Rises a fairy of the lake. Half veiled within the sparkling strife, His inexperienced eyes scarce see The pale forms changing into life, Till all is glowing pageantry. True to their sovereign's summons they, Upon the lake's enchanted shore, Await her presence proud and gay, Where rides the fleet to waft her o'er. And now a spicy, rare perfume, Such as breathes from Indian dells, Fills all the high-wood's leafy dome, And the fine Fairie presence tells. And faint aërial strains are heard, As through the rich, festooning ways, The Queen in moonlit-pomp appeared, Amongst ten thousand dancing Fays. By gold and purple butterflies Her rose-leaved car was drawn in air; Above, two birds of Paradise Arch o'er her head their plumage rare. While, far around her, dancing beams, That with bright rainbow colours glow, Strike on the gloom in transient gleams, And all her elfin-escort show. All in the busy air around Pert eyes and little wings are seen, And voices whisper, feathers sound, Attendant on their elfin-queen. A robe of silvery snow she wore, Frosted with magic art so true, That the hot breath of Midsummer Could never change it into dew. And, wafted by her happy bird, A courtier-fairy oft proclaims, “Now let the mirthful song be heard; Our lady queen a welcome claims.” The little bird too 'gan to sing, And then the fairy tried her voice; As gaily as the airs of Spring Did that poor little bird rejoice. The measure changed, a languid call, Sweet with sorrow, thrice it sounded, Concluding in a dying fall, Softer than e'er fountain rounded. “O Nightingale! it was thy song Sent through the woods that dying close; I know thee now; the note prolong; Oh! speak again those tender woes!” Under the boughs, the elfin-train Mutely listened to the measure; But, when he trilled his joy again, They beat the ground in antic pleasure. “O bird of feeling, various, sweet! Thee and thy guardian-friend I hail; I know Thee now, and gladly greet The Love-Fay and her nightingale. All fly before the elfin-queen, Toward the lake's high-crowned head, Near where the forest-oaks begin A reverential gloom to spread. With thousand sparks the woodbank swarms: Her glow-worm knights, in long array, Marshalled by Fire-fly—King at Arms, Guard her and light her on her way. Where'er they move, the drowsy flowers Unclose their leafy curtains far; And Fays, asleep within their bowers, Leap forth, and dance before her car; Dance to that crystal lake's green side, That winds through fir-crowned lawns and woods, Whose beeches old, in giant pride, Fling their broad shadows on the floods. And oft they wantoned with the surge, That, flowing near the Fairie court, It's silver line on line did urge, As if to tempt and share their sport; As if to woo the elfin-queen, To float upon its moonlight breast; Pleased to unfold each margent scene, And bear her to her bower of rest. The smile, that played upon it's face, She seemed by magic lore to read; And, with a kind and sportive grace, She bade her tiny sailors speed. A fleet of pleasure-boats lay there, Such vessels as befit a sprite; The water-lilies schooners were, Leaf after leaf out-spreading white. There skiffs, fresh gathered from the lime: There acorn-barges broad and deep; So safe, that, e'en in tempest-time, An Elf upon his oars might sleep, And in his Heart of Oak could go, His tiny Dreadnought, singing gay, Spite of the winds and rocks below, Round every fairy cliff and bay. Sweet wherries of long lavender, Blossoms of every shape and stain, From blue-bell yachts to bird-pepper, Attended for the courtier-train. But their bright Queen more proudly sailed In a pearl-shell ship of the line: By water mouse-ear was she veiled, And she was fanned with eglantine. Her canopy, bedropped with gold, Had floated on the Indian tide; A lotos-leaf, with ample fold, Swelled for her sail, in snowy pride. The cordage was of silver thread Spun of fine bark of ashen tree; The mast of sandal wood; the head A living dolphin seemed to be. Her green knights watched upon the shrouds, Or ranged them far along the prow; Stood round their Queen, in radiant crowds, Or gleamed far on the wave below. And others, ranked as on a cone, Stage above stage, of towery height, Moved on the lake around her throne, Proud, floating pyramids of light. Above them all, then might you spy, In busy care, high o'er the mast, Their king-at-arms, Sir Lanthorn-fly, Ordering the pageant, as it past; And, glancing down the moonlight air, He checked the lily-schooner's way; And, whisking here and whisking there, Recalled each blossom-sail astray. Then, self-triumphant, in the van, In airy circles pleased he danced; Yet, while he led the revel on, Back, for his Queen's applauses glanced. And thus in gliding state she went O'er the long windings of the wave, Where many a watchful eye was bent, From hollow oak and secret cave. The screech-owl and the snake were there, The boding raven, cruel kite, That fill the timid heart with care, And love to prowl in moonless night. But chief on the old Forest's bound, Where the still waters sink away, Such evil agents walk their round, Or lurk within the oaks so grey. Bewildered in the wild-wood glades, Edwy oft lost the long lake's side; Till, through some deep grove's opening shades, He saw the splendid vision glide. Low glanced the silver oars along, Quick came the spires of glow-worm light, That round their Queen's tall galley throng, Shooting long beams aslant the night; These, trembling through the branches' dome, Touching each leaf with transient joy, Now seen, now lost, from gloom to gloom, Showed like the stars, when clouds fleet by. Then, over banks and under woods, Edwy pursued the pageant's way; Till, having reached the smiling floods, The frolick shores his hopes betray. For, winding back, his course they mar, Leaving him on some jutting steep, 'Mid the lone waters, while afar The inmost bay the Fairies sweep. And thus through wilds and woods he toiled, Lured by short glimpse of that bright train, Which through the distant shadows smiled, As if in mockery of his pain. Till, once again, he heard remote That gentle bird, faithful to lovers; And, following the high-warbled note, Again the Fairie fleet discovers: Just as it touched the farther shore, To land the Queen those groves among; When still was every little oar, And every white sail breathless hung. No sound was heard but Music's voice, Roused by the motley elfin-band, Who play in moonshine, and rejoice In choral welcomes o'er the strand. The groves, that hovered o'er the brink, The polished lake more dark returns; And each bright star, in emerald twink, Beneath the wave more keenly burns. And there, the rival of their beams, Reflected by the glass below, A shooting-star Sir Fire-fly seems, While marshalling the Fairie show. Each shroud and sail of Fairie bark, Each glittering oar and image fair, Within that mirror, blue and dark, Lay, like a picture, pencilled fair. But when Sir Fire-fly's knights moved on, And their green torches mutely raised, Then all the Fairie's splendour shone, And shores and woods and waters blazed. Thus, ranged in vista-lines of light, Moving beneath the leafy gloom, Where forest-oaks spread deepest night, They guard her to her sylvan home. Under an ancient beech, that high Out-hung it's spray, her dreams of night Were veiled from every curious eye, Save when with magic virtue bright. It's mighty boughs a circle filled; Like necromantic guard it stood; It's air severe the wanderer chilled, It's frown and haughty attitude. Soon as that beechen shade she reached, Rustled its every leaf for joy; Then gracefully her wand she stretched, And lighted all its leaves on high. Yet flame of torch, or lamp, was none, Nor any glittering sparkle there; It seemed as if the setting sun Tinged the rich spray with rosy air. Her bower through many chambers ranged, And each a different purpose showed; This, oft with mystic shadows changed; That, for the dance, or banquet, glowed. Beyond them all, her cell of rest In verdant shade and silence lay; Save, when the ring-dove in her nest Sung all her gentle cares away: And sleepy leaves, scarce moved in air, Or only swayed by breezes fleet, With the lake's murmuring falls afar, Made melody most sad and sweet. Lime-blossoms strewed the mossy floor, And breathed a dewy fragrance round, Inviting her to slumbers pure, While freshness seemed to bless the ground. Yet here, sometimes, this Queen of dreams Would weave such seeming forms of fate, As, sent upon the still moonbeams, Oft by the midnight sleeper wait. Hid in her cool bower might she view The noontide lake and sunny lawns; The slow sail on the waters blue, And, through the brakes, the fleeting fawns; And watch them on the watery brim, Bending to sip the dainty wave, Then starting at the form so slim, The shadowed crystal truly gave. Unseen, she traced each step that roved Rejoicing on that margent green; Or sought the hills and groves beloved, That crown with pleasant shade the scene. Edwy had joined the Fairie's train, Just as she reached her leafy dome, While full arose the choral strain Of welcome to her beechen home. Her glow-worm knights, wide round the beech, In glimmering circles take their stand; Adder, nor bird of boding speech, Nor step unblest may pass that band. In front, high on the beechen spray, Like Hesper, on the eastern dawn, Sir Fire-fly spreads his watchful ray O'er dell obscure and distant lawn. No shape, among the shadows there, Could glide unseen, nor move, where frowned That beech's wizard brows in air, And shrink not from the mystic ground. Save Edwy, with his magic spell;— Invisible and fearless, he Might pass e'en to the Fairie's cell, Unknown—but of one enemy. She tripped into her vestibule, Arched high with rose and eglantine, Breathing a fragrance light and cool, And bright with dew-drops, crystalline. Here many a bell, that, in the day, Had hung its fainting head awry, Now waked for her in beauty gay, And breathed for her its perfumed sigh. Her pavilion next she entered; Clear the glassy columns shone; To the turf steps Edwy ventured, And beheld her on her throne. Under an ebon arch reclining, With brilliant drops all thickly hung, Where Mimosa's leaves were twining, She listened, while the Love-Fay sung. The thousand dew-drops hanging there And in the swelling dome, on high, Trembled with radiance keen and fair, Poured from her living diamond's eye. Splendour and Joy around her moved, And winning smiles beamed in her face, And every virtue most beloved Gave to her air a tender grace. On the ruby-pavement stealing, Circling Elves their homage gave, Then, in quaint moriscoes reeling, They dance, and airy garlands wave. The silver-triangle, the lute, The tambourine, with tiny bells, Mix with the softly-breathing flute; The mellow horn more distant swells. A quaint and various group arrived: One, fliting on a bat's wing came, No orchard, where he haunted, thrived; Malignant Elfant was his name. One, upon a field-mouse gliding, Oft the traveller appalled, Wondrously his steps misguiding; Sly Elféna she was called. A third, upon a squirrel springing, Never rested, night, or day; Into some droll mischief bringing Solemn heads, as well as gay. On butterfly next sailed a Fairie; She soothes fine ladies in their vapour, Who of unchanging good are weary, And weep, because they've nought to weep for. Winged by an owl, there came an elf, Who loved to haunt the study-table, Where, full of grave, important self, The wisest head he would disable. And make it Pro-and-Con and fight On subjects lofty as the steeple; Or tempt some Witling to endite Long dreams, about the elfin-people! And now, the Fairie Queen demanded Whether her elves the tasks had done, That, at sun-set, she had commanded; And now she called them one by one. She called them, but they came not all; Again, the magic horn was wound, Then thronging sprites obeyed the call; But still some truants wild were found. Yet was this blast so distant heard, That elves, on Windsor's battlement, Mounted the moonbeams at it's word, And o'er the Long Walk gaily went; Nor stayed upon the tufts to dance Of the broad, bowery way, that swept, With utmost pomp, beneath their glance, Though there the yellow moonlight slept; Though many a bird they loved was hid In silent rest, beneath the leaves, Which, if awaked and gently bid, Would sing the song that care deceives— Yet, had they surely waked them, too, And danced a morrice on the trees, Had not the horn complaining blew, Like coming of a tempest breeze. But e'en the Fairie's summons failed, Yielding awhile to Beauty's spell, When Windsor's proudest groves they hailed, Crowning its wildest, deepest dell. They paused a moment on that brow, Under the shading oaks they strayed, To spy, beneath the branches low, The moonlight-towers, beyond their shade. Beyond that shade in peace they lay, Gates, turrets, battlements aloft, Just silvered by the distant ray, That 'neath the dark boughs glimmered oft. It seemed some vision of the air, By magic raised in forest lone, That held entranced some lady fair, Till nodding towers her knight should own. The horn again! but not like breeze Before some gentle summer shower, But rushing through th' affrighted trees, E'en with an angry whirlwind's power. The moonlight-castle sinks and fades, Beneath the tossing boughs afar; And fear the truant elves invades; And swift they mount their beamy car. No banquet in the bower for them; No tripping strains their steps invite; The Fairie sovereign will condemn Their disobedience and their slight. “Hence,” she cries, “a vision weave For the couch of that false lover, Who could a trusting heart deceive; Hence, and o'er his slumber hover. “Dance before him, like a shade; Trace upon his sleeping eye Image of that mournful maid, Whom he won, and left to die; “In my cell of shadows look You will there the semblance see, Of the damsel he forsook All from idle vanity. “Touch his heart with jealousy, Shape a dream to rouse despair; Then to the sad maiden flee, And expel her silly care. “So, when the streaky dawn doth wake, Each shall rise, with changed intent; Each shall the other's fortune take, He, despair—and she, content. “If these dreams ye shadow well, Return, before the lark is up, Or the chime of matin bell; Dance the morrice; sip the cup. “Now farewell.” Scarce had she spoke, when all the bower As in a twilight shadow lay; The dewy lamp on every flower Quivered first, then died away. Her magic diamond warned the Queen Of step unhallowed passing near; It paled its ray to trembling green, And shrunk with sympathetic fear. Then hastily the Queen exclaimed, “Some mortal footsteps press the ground;” For Edwy, when the Elves she named, Had nearer drawn to catch the sound. Just then the little Nightingale, In pity of the lover's pain, Sung from Mimosa's shadowy veil His softest, sweetest, saddest tale. Which, well he knew, his Queen would win From aught ungracious, or severe. With charmed, attentive, brow serene, She smiled, and, dashing off a tear, On Eda called, the Love Fay, thrice, Some tale of mortal truth to tell:— Her name did Edwy's heart rejoice; For, that Fay's name completes his spell! Then straight, the bower began to show Returning light; and, through each bud, From faintness freed to living glow, Circled the bright transparent blood. Now what of chastisement befell This vagrant swain, for his intrusion, Village-tradition does not tell, Or tells with most profound confusion. But this most gossips do relate, That, though he was not held in durance, He gained no knowledge of his fate, And nothing got by his assurance, Unless it be, that he did see What seldom had been seen before, A Fairie Court, in starlight sport, With pleasure squadrons and on shore. But haply, on some other day, We may learn more of his manœuvres, And then we shall not fail to say, What came of Aura and her lovers. PART III. THE MAGIC MIRRORS. A SUMMER NIGHT IN WINDSOR FOREST. Edwy forsook the Fairie Court, And to forest-glades withdrew, Where never yet had elfin-sport Cheered the melancholy view. Upon the hazel-wands he writes Eda's name, with “thrice and three,” Then buries them, with bidden rites, Underneath a forest-tree. It was an oak, whose trunk within A foul and watching spirit lay, Whose night-shrieks in the tempest-din, Filled the traveller with dismay: It was an oak, whose sinewy boughs Threw a dark horror o'er the ground; Whose high, gaunt top and warrior-brows With the storms of ages frowned. Its trunk was never touched with light, So wide and deep the branching shade Of leaves, that, on a starry night, A gleam, like break of morning, shed. But the brook, stealing from the brake, Showed a glimpse of brighter ray, When on it's dewy banks did take Will-o'-the Wisp his mystic way. Round the high roots our Edwy drew, With muttered charm, a magic line; And in the circle heart's ease threw, And briony and eglantine; Then sweets and poisons, three and three, Jess'mine blossoms, violet bud, The deadly nightshade's tresses grey, And the pale Monk's gloomy head. Next, the buried wands he raised, And “Eda! Eda! Eda!” called; Thrice upon the West he gazed, When, hark! a shriek his breast appalled. It was the spirit of the oak, Who, startled by the Love-Fay's name, His dark and secret home forsook. He fled, in haste, whene'er she came. A tongue from Windsor's distant tower Tolled Twelve along the silent wood, When, lo! the planet of the hour Quivered upon the trembling flood. Cheered by the monitory sight, Then Edwy forth his mirrors drew, And by that star's informing light, Upheld them to his searching view. Again he called on Eda's name Mildly and meekly to appear. And round the crystals rolled a flame; While unknown murmurs met his ear. See!—o'er the mirrors mists arise, And strange and fearful shadows throng; Frowning faces, glaring eyes Look and threat and glance along. These gone, a tiny form there bounds, Flitting along the magic glass; Which, in an instant, her surrounds With leaves of Love in Idleness. She seems reclining in a bower, As the green leaves around her spread, The motley-yellow, purple flower Bends in a top-knot o'er her head. As round this cage of wreaths she hies, Forth from her wand a lustre pale Dawns o'er her blue and frolic eyes, And silvers all her dewy veil, Touches the rose upon her cheek, The dimple, that her quaint lip owns, The smile, that now begins to break, Through clouds of wild, capricious frowns. While Edwy gazed, a little strain Of sweet complaint did feebly swell, When, hovering round her leafy chain, Behold! her faithful Nightingale! He perched upon the true-knot there, And tried to break, with slender bill, Her prison-wreath, so flowery fair; But the leaves mocked his puny skill. Too late, she owns the forceful spell The little purple blossom throws. Fixed, as a painting, she must tell Mildly and meekly all she knows! “Fairy Eda! show to me Aura, as she's now employed.”— “On the other glass you'll see;” With pretty lisp the Fay replied. He looked; the colours faintly dawn, And living forms begin to glow: Aura, full-dressed in lace and lawn, Blooms in a ball-room with a beau. And, dancing with a Grace's air, And with the eyes of Venus smiling, Edwy beheld her, with despair, His hated rival's heart beguiling. To atoms he had almost dashed The mirror, and so lost the spell, But warning lights around him flashed, Checked his hand, and all was well, “Who is this Fop, so light and vain?”— Quickly, the magic scene is changed To rivers, woods, a wide domain, With falconers on the banks ranged. All at their head his rival pranced In velvet cap, with feathers gay, And proudly o'er the sward advanced, While men and steeds their lord obey. “O tell me, Eda—loves she him? Can she her promise old forget?”— A flame curled round the mirror's rim; The crystal darkened into jet. And in long moonlight prospect rose Windsor-Terrace, flanked with towers; How soft the lights and shades repose Among the low Park's lawns and bowers! Oh! what an arch the heavens throw Upon the vast horizon round! The stars! how numberless they glow Down to the landscape's dim-seen bound! Some battlements are left in night; Others almost appear to shine Of yonder tower, whose stately height Draws on the sky a tall black line, That measures, on the azure void, Billions of miles, while worlds unknown, Distant howe'er, glow, side by side, Upon it's shadowy profile shown. Down on the terrace, men appear, Gliding along the stately wall, With arms enfolding the tall spear— How still their measured footsteps fall! Voices are heard round that vast shade, Although no talkers meet the sight; But, beyond, where moonbeams spread, Figures steal upon the light. 'Twas Aura, with a lady-friend— 'Twas Aura, with this lover new! Ah! does she to his suit attend? The distance baffled Edwy's view. “Eda! Eda! why torment me With obscure ambiguous truth? Thou to show my fate wast sent me. Say, will she wed this fopling-youth?” Behold! the terrace fades away! And a tap'stried room succeeds; Her sire, with age and wisdom grey, 'Mid lawyer, settlements and deed Again, the charmed picture changed: A gothic porch, with silk all hung; There beaux and ladies fair are ranged, While humbler gazers round them throng. There a happy rival waited With his friends, in trim array: “Aura! what makes thee belated? Aura! why this long delay?” Again, the mirrors were in danger, From our thoughtless Edwy's rage; But a fairie checked his anger— Would she might his grief assuage! Next, dimly on the crystal steals A chamber in her father's home; There, Aura, weeping, pleads and kneels! The father, frowning, quits the room. Again the changeful glass receives The porch—and Edwy, doth he tremble, As smiling Aura there he sees? And whom doth the bridegroom resemble? It is—himself!—He's joyous, frantic, As the glass showed his happy shape; But as he sprung, with gesture antic, It fell, and let the fairie 'scape! Without due homage let her fly! Straight, unknown voices from the ground Wildly exclaimed, “O fie! fie! fie!” And “Fie! fie! fie!” the echoes sound. Unhomaged he had let her fly! From the old oak an owlet hooted; And thence a louder “Fie! fie! fie!” To the spot poor Edwy rooted. But, soon recovered, through the woods, Hopeful and light, away he sprung: The moon peeped through their leafy hoods, And o'er the path her chequers flung. To the forest's-edge he hied, Where the Beech's giant-form Had, for age on age, defied, With his lion-fangs the storm: Where the Lime, with spotted bark— Spots, that old moss on silver weaves, Hung her spray on branches dark Among the light transparent leaves, And fragrant blossoms, forming bowers, That cast, at noon, a twilight green, Where 'twas most sweet to watch the hours Change the highly-tinctured scene. The silvery Aspin quivered nigh, The spiry Pine in darkness rose, The Ash, all airy grace, on high Waved her lightly-feathered boughs. And there the mighty Chesnut reared His massy verdure, deepening night; Whose pale flowers through the dark appeared Like gleams of April's coldest light. Under the low boughs Edwy went. Shade, after shade, in close array, A sadder tint to midnight lent; And thoughtless Edwy lost his way. Now, far beyond the long-drawn gloom, Where a faint, misty moonlight fell, He watched a lonely figure roam, And loud he made the echoes swell. His call was heard, the stranger turned, And paused a moment; but, in vain, Our Edwy would his way have learned, For, not a word in answer came. The vision fled—but soon a cry, Loud, though far-off, alarmed his ear; And a footstep passed him by; Which he followed fast and near. Till a groan of sad affright Almost killed him, with dismay; And to his undoubting sight There a man expiring lay. As, horror-fixed, awhile he stood, A cloud o'erspread it's darkening veil; It suited well his fearful mood; It hid that dreadful visage pale. Now, mark, where yonder high elms crowd, What red lights gleam and pass along! What funeral torches, dirges loud! A bier and mourners round it throng. Down th' avenue of pines they go: All sad and chaunting their despair, Then wind they on in pomp of woe; Then fade and vanish into air! For, yonder, o'er the eastern hill, Morning's crystal tint is seen, Edging the darkness, solemn still, And glimmering o'er the sleeping scene. O best of light! O light of soul! O blessed Dawn, to thee we owe The humbled thought—our mind's best dole, The bliss of praise—Devotion's glow. O blessed Dawn! more sweet to me Thy gradual hues, thy influence fine O'er flying darkness, than the ray And glorious pomp, that doth enshrine The cope of heaven, when the Sun Comes laughing from the joyous East, And bids th' expressive shadows run To tell his coming to the West. At thy first tint the happy lark Awakes, and trills his note of joy; And feebler, warbling murmurs, hark! Break from the woodlands—rise, and die, At thy first tint, O blessed light! Th' observant Elves and spectres fled, And that misguiding, watching sprite Home to her oaken dungeon sped; Elfena then, the mischief-fay, Who with an urchin had combined To 'wilder Edwy thus astray; Now in a Monk's-hood is confined. No dying man was there—no moan, There were no red-lights, near the elms, No funeral torches, dirge's moan, No sable band, whom grief o'erwhelms. Still, doubtful of his homeward way, Our hero watched the rise of dawn, Over a beech-tree's airy spray, That trembles on the Park's high lawn. And soon the glorious Sun was spied, And Windsor, in her pomp of groves, Rose up in battlemented pride, Queen of the vale, that Old Thames loves— From where the far-seen western hill In smiling slumber seems to lie, Upon the azure vault so still As listening heaven's harmony, To where, beneath the eastern ray, With swelling dome and spires aloft, Vast London's lengthened city lay, All miniatured, distinct and soft— To where, upon the northern edge, Learned Harrow points her vane, And Stanmore lifts it's heathy ridge, Sloping to the cultured plain, Which, purpled with the morning's glow, To boundless tints of azure fades, While humbler spires and hamlets show Their sun-lights o'er the woody shades; And gleaming Thames along the vale, 'Midst willowy meads, his waters led, While, here and there, a feeble sail Was to the scarce-felt breeze outspread. The willowy meads and lawns rejoice; And every heath, and warbling wood; The fragrant air, with whispering voice, The golden clouds, the brightened flood, All laugh and sing beneath the morn, The dancing lamb, the springing deer; The wild bee with his humming horn, And, loud and long, Sir Chanticleer. Soon as his joyous clarion calls, Answering notes strike up and swell From rafter dark and loop-holed walls, Where sleep and silence seemed to dwell, Surprising with their clamour clear The passing herdsman and his hound; Thus, far and near, Sir Chanticleer Rouses up all the country round. Edwy so roused, who long had stood Over this scene of morning beauty, Forgetting every other good, And lost to each forgotten duty, Now, bounding lightly down the hills And through the high o'erarching groves, Hied to his home, where Eda wills He soon shall wed the nymph he loves; And grateful for the boon she grants, He now resolves, that, never more, His spell shall shock her quiet haunts; And quite abjures the magic lore. But,—never let impatient wight, When he presumes to woo a fairie, Destroy his glass,—or rouse her spite, But civil be—and very wary. Thus all was well, As watchmen tell, Of fairie sports in Windsor glades, Save that too long A summer-song Once lingered in those witching shades. SCENE ON THE NORTHERN SHORE OF SICILY. Here, from the Castle's terraced site, I view, once more, the varied scene Of hamlets, woods, and pastures green, And vales far stretching from the sight Beneath the tints of coming night; And there is misty ocean seen, With glancing oars and waves serene, And stealing sail of shifting light. Now, let me hear the shepherd's lay, As on some bank he sits alone; That oaten reed, of tender tone, He loves, at setting sun, to play. It speaks in Joy's delightful glee; Then Pity's strains its breath obey— Or Love's soft voice it seems to be— And steals at last the soul away! And now, the village bells afar Their melancholy music sound Mournfully o'er the waters round, Till Twilight sends her trembling star. Oft shall my pensive heart attend, As swell the notes along the breeze, And weep anew the buried friend, In tears, that sadly, softly please; And, when pale moonlight tips the trees, On the dark Castle's tower ascends, Throws o'er it's walls a silvery gleam, And in one soft confusion blends Forest and mountain, plain and stream, I list the drowsy sounds, that creep On night's still air, to soothe the soul; The hollow moan of Ocean's roll, The bleat and bell of wandering sheep, The distant watch-dog's feeble bark, The voice of herdsman pacing home Along the leafy labyrinth dark, And sounds, that from the Castle come Of closing door, that sullen falls, And murmurs, through the chambers high Of half-sung strains from ancient halls, That through the long, long galleries die. And now the taper's flame I spy In antique casement, glimmering pale; And now 'tis vanished from my eye, And all but gloom and silence fail. Once more, I stand in pensive mood, And gaze on forms, that Truth delude; And still, 'mid Fancy's flitting scene, I catch the streaming cottage-light, Twinkling the restless leaves between, And Ocean's flood, in moonbeams bright.
