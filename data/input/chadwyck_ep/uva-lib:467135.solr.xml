      <field name="fulltext">WESSEX POEMS AND OTHER VERSES THE TEMPORARY THE ALL (SAPPHICS) Change and chancefulness in my flowering youthtime, Set me sun by sun near to one unchosen; Wrought us fellowlike, and despite divergence, Fused us in friendship. “Cherish him can I while the true one forthcome— Come the rich fulfiller of my prevision; Life is roomy yet, and the odds unbounded.” So self-communed I. 'Thwart my wistful way did a damsel saunter, Fair, albeit unformed to be all-eclipsing; “Maiden meet,” held I, “till arise my forefelt Wonder of women.” Long a visioned hermitage deep desiring, Tenements uncouth I was fain to house in: “Let such lodging be for a breath-while,” thought I, “Soon a more seemly. “Then high handiwork will I make my life-deed, Truth and Light outshow; but the ripe time pending, Intermissive aim at the thing sufficeth.” Thus I. . . . But lo, me! Mistress, friend, place, aims to be bettered straightway, Bettered not has Fate or my hand's achievement; Sole the showance those of my onward earth-track— Never transcended! AMABEL I marked her ruined hues, Her custom-straitened views, And asked, “Can there indwell My Amabel?” I looked upon her gown, Once rose, now earthen brown; The change was like the knell Of Amabel. Her step's mechanic ways Had lost the life of May's; Her laugh, once sweet in swell, Spoilt Amabel. I mused: “Who sings the strain I sang ere warmth did wane? Who thinks its numbers spell His Amabel?”— Knowing that, though Love cease, Love's race shows no decrease; All find in dorp or dell An Amabel. —I felt that I could creep To some housetop, and weep That Time the tyrant fell Ruled Amabel! I said (the while I sighed That love like ours had died), “Fond things I'll no more tell To Amabel, “But leave her to her fate, And fling across the gate, ‘Till the Last Trump, farewell, O Amabel!’” 1865. HAP If but some vengeful god would call to me From up the sky, and laugh: “Thou suffering thing, Know that thy sorrow is my ecstasy, That thy love's loss is my hate's profiting!” Then would I bear it, clench myself, and die, Steeled by the sense of ire unmerited; Half-eased in that a Powerfuller than I Had willed and meted me the tears I shed. But not so. How arrives it joy lies slain, And why unblooms the best hope ever sown? —Crass Casualty obstructs the sun and rain, And dicing Time for gladness casts a moan. . . . These purblind Doomsters had as readily strown Blisses about my pilgrimage as pain. 1866. “IN VISION I ROAMED” TO ? In vision I roamed the flashing Firmament, So fierce in blazon that the Night waxed wan, As though with awe at orbs of such ostént; And as I thought my spirit ranged on and on In footless traverse through ghast heights of sky, To the last chambers of the monstrous Dome, Where stars the brightest here are lost to the eye: Then, any spot on our own Earth seemed Home! And the sick grief that you were far away Grew pleasant thankfulness that you were near, Who might have been, set on some foreign Sphere, Less than a Want to me, as day by day I lived unware, uncaring all that lay Locked in that Universe taciturn and drear. 1866. AT A BRIDAL NATURE'S INDIFFERENCE When you paced forth, to await maternity, A dream of other offspring held my mind, Compounded of us twain as Love designed; Rare forms, that corporate now will never be! Should I, too, wed as slave to Mode's decree, And each thus found apart, of false desire, A stolid line, whom no high aims will fire As had fired ours could ever have mingled we; And, grieved that lives so matched should miscompose, Each mourn the double waste; and question dare To the Great Dame whence incarnation flows, Why those high-purposed children never were: What will she answer? That she does not care If the race all such sovereign types unknows. 1866. POSTPONEMENT Snow-bound in woodland, a mournful word, Dropt now and then from the bill of a bird, Reached me on wind-wafts; and thus I heard, Wearily waiting:— “I planned her a nest in a leafless tree, But the passers eyed and twitted me, And said: ‘How reckless a bird is he, Cheerily mating!’ “Fear-filled, I stayed me till summer-tide, In lewth of leaves to throne her bride; But alas! her love for me waned and died. Wearily waiting. “Ah, had I been like some I see, Born to an evergreen nesting-tree, None had eyed and twitted me, Cheerily mating!” 1866. A CONFESSION TO A FRIEND IN TROUBLE Your troubles shrink not, though I feel them less Here, far away, than when I tarried near; I even smile old smiles—with listlessness— Yet smiles they are, not ghastly mockeries mere. A thought too strange to house within my brain Haunting its outer precincts I discern: —That I will not show zeal again to learn Your griefs, and, sharing them, renew my pain. . . . It goes, like murky bird or buccaneer That shapes its lawless figure on the main, And staunchness tends to banish utterly The unseemly instinct that had lodgment here; Yet, comrade old, can bitterer knowledge be Than that, though banned, such instinct was in me! 1866. NEUTRAL TONES We stood by a pond that winter day, And the sun was white, as though chidden of God, And a few leaves lay on the starving sod; —They had fallen from an ash, and were gray. Your eyes on me were as eyes that rove Over tedious riddles of years ago; And some words played between us to and fro On which lost the more by our love. The smile on your mouth was the deadest thing Alive enough to have strength to die; And a grin of bitterness swept thereby Like an ominous bird a-wing. . . . Since then, keen lessons that love deceives, And wrings with wrong, have shaped to me Your face, and the God-curst sun, and a tree, And a pond edged with grayish leaves. 1867. SHE AT HIS FUNERAL They bear him to his resting-place— In slow procession sweeping by; I follow at a stranger's space; His kindred they, his sweetheart I. Unchanged my gown of garish dye, Though sable-sad is their attire; But they stand round with griefless eye, Whilst my regret consumes like fire! 187?. HER INITIALS Upon a poet's page I wrote Of old two letters of her name; Part seemed she of the effulgent thought Whence that high singer's rapture came. —When now I turn the leaf the same Immortal light illumes the lay, But from the letters of her name The radiance has waned away! 1869. HER DILEMMA (IN ? CHURCH) The two were silent in a sunless church, Whose mildewed walls, uneven paving-stones, And wasted carvings passed antique research; And nothing broke the clock's dull monotones. Leaning against a wormy poppy-head, So wan and worn that he could scarcely stand, —For he was soon to die,—he softly said, “Tell me you love me!”—holding long her hand. She would have given a world to breathe “yes” truly, So much his life seemed hanging on her mind, And hence she lied, her heart persuaded throughly 'Twas worth her soul to be a moment kind. But the sad need thereof, his nearing death, So mocked humanity that she shamed to prize A world conditioned thus, or care for breath Where Nature such dilemmas could devise. 1866. REVULSION Though I waste watches framing words to fetter Some unknown spirit to mine in clasp and kiss, Out of the night there looms a sense 'twere better To fail obtaining whom one fails to miss. For winning love we win the risk of losing, And losing love is as one's life were riven; It cuts like contumely and keen ill-using To cede what was superfluously given. Let me then never feel the fateful thrilling That devastates the love-worn wooer's frame, The hot ado of fevered hopes, the chilling That agonizes disappointed aim! So may I live no junctive law fulfilling, And my heart's table bear no woman's name. 1866. SHE, TO HIM I When you shall see me in the toils of Time, My lauded beauties carried off from me, My eyes no longer stars as in their prime, My name forgot of Maiden Fair and Free; When, in your being, heart concedes to mind, And judgment, though you scarce its process know, Recalls the excellencies I once enshrined, And you are irked that they have withered so: Remembering mine the loss is, not the blame, That Sportsman Time but rears his brood to kill, Knowing me in my soul the very same— One who would die to spare you touch of ill!— Will you not grant to old affection's claim The hand of friendship down Life's sunless hill? 1866. SHE, TO HIM II Perhaps, long hence, when I have passed away, Some other's feature, accent, thought like mine, Will carry you back to what I used to say, And bring some memory of your love's decline. Then you may pause awhile and think, “Poor jade!” And yield a sigh to me—as ample due, Not as the tittle of a debt unpaid To one who could resign her all to you— And thus reflecting, you will never see That your thin thought, in two small words conveyed, Was no such fleeting phantom-thought to me, But the Whole Life wherein my part was played; And you amid its fitful masquerade A Thought—as I in your life seem to be! 1866. SHE, TO HIM III I will be faithful to thee; aye, I will! And Death shall choose me with a wondering eye That he did not discern and domicile One his by right ever since that last Good-bye! I have no care for friends, or kin, or prime Of manhood who deal gently with me here; Amid the happy people of my time Who work their love's fulfilment, I appear Numb as a vane that cankers on its point, True to the wind that kissed ere canker came: Despised by souls of Now, who would disjoint The mind from memory, making Life all aim, My old dexterities in witchery gone, And nothing left for Love to look upon. 1866. SHE, TO HIM IV This love puts all humanity from me; I can but maledict her, pray her dead, For giving love and getting love of thee— Feeding a heart that else mine own had fed! How much I love I know not, life not known, Save as one unit I would add love by; But this I know, my being is but thine own— Fused from its separateness by ecstasy. And thus I grasp thy amplitudes, of her Ungrasped, though helped by nigh-regarding eyes; Canst thou then hate me as an envier Who see unrecked what I so dearly prize? Believe me, Lost One, Love is lovelier The more it shapes its moan in selfish-wise. 1866. DITTY (E. L. G.) Beneath a knap where flown Nestlings play, Within walls of weathered stone, Far away From the files of formal houses, By the bough the firstling browses, Lives a Sweet: no merchants meet, No man barters, no man sells Where she dwells. Upon that fabric fair “Here is she!” Seems written everywhere Unto me. But to friends and nodding neighbours, Fellow-wights in lot and labours, Who descry the times as I, No such lucid legend tells Where she dwells. Should I lapse to what I was Ere we met; (Such will not be, but because Some forget Let me feign it)—none would notice That where she I know by rote is Spread a strange and withering change. Like a drying of the wells Where she dwells. To feel I might have kissed— Loved as true— Otherwhere, nor Mine have missed My life through, Had I never wandered near her, Is a smart severe—severer In the thought that she is nought, Even as I, beyond the dells Where she dwells. And Devotion droops her glance To recall What bond-servants of Chance We are all. I but found her in that, going On my errant path unknowing, I did not out-skirt the spot That no spot on earth excels, —Where she dwells! 1870. THE SERGEANT'S SONG (1803) When Lawyers strive to heal a breach, And Parsons practise what they preach; Then Boney he'll come pouncing down, And march his men on London town! Rollicum-rorum, tol-lol-lorum, Rollicum-rorum, tol-lol-lay! When Justices hold equal scales, And Rogues are only found in jails; Then Boney he'll come pouncing down, And march his men on London town! Rollicum-rorum, &amp;c. When Rich Men find their wealth a curse, And fill therewith the Poor Man's purse; Then Boney he'll come pouncing down, And march his men on London town! Rollicum-rorum, &amp;c. When Husbands with their Wives agree, And Maids won't wed from modesty; Then Boney he'll come pouncing down, And march his men on London town! Rollicum-rorum, tol-tol-lorum, Rollicum-rorum, tol-lol-lay! 1878. Published in “The Trumpet-Major” 1880. VALENCIENNES (1793) By Corp'l Tullidge, in “The Trumpet Major.” In Memory of S. C. (Pensioner). Died 184? We trenched, we trumpeted and drummed, And from our mortars tons of iron hummed Ath'art the ditch, the month we bombed The Town o' Valencieën. 'Twas in the June o' Ninety-dree (The Duke o' Yark our then Commander been) The German Legion, Guards, and we Laid siege to Valencieën. This was the first time in the war That French and English spilled each other's gore; —Few dreamt how far would roll the roar Begun at Valencieën! 'Twas said that we'd no business there A-topperèn the French for disagreën; However, that's not my affair— We were at Valencieën. Such snocks and slats, since war began Never knew raw recruit or veteràn: Stone-deaf therence went many a man Who served at Valencieën. Into the streets, ath'art the sky, A hundred thousand balls and bombs were fleën; And harmless townsfolk fell to die Each hour at Valencieën! And, sweatèn wi' the bombardiers, A shell was slent to shards anighst my ears: —'Twas nigh the end of hopes and fears For me at Valencieën! They bore my wownded frame to camp, And shut my gapèn skull, and washed en cleän, And jined en wi' a zilver clamp Thik night at Valencieën. “We've fetched en back to quick from dead But never more on earth while rose is red Will drum rouse Corpel!” Doctor said O' me at Valencieën. 'Twer true. No voice o' friend or foe Can reach me now, or any livèn beën; And little have I power to know Since then at Valencieën! I never hear the zummer hums O' bees; and don' know when the cuckoo comes; But night and day I hear the bombs We threw at Valencieën. . . . As for the Duke o' Yark in war, There may be volk whose judgment o' en is meän; But this I say—he was not far From great at Valencieën. O' wild wet nights, when all seems sad, My wownds come back, as though new wownds I'd had; But yet—at times I'm sort o' glad I fout at Valencieën. Well: Heaven wi' its jasper halls Is now the on'y Town I care to be in. . . . Good Lord, if Nick should bomb the walls As we did Valencieën! 1878–1897. SAN SEBASTIAN (August 1813) With Thoughts of Sergeant M? (Pensioner), who died 185? “Why, Sergeant, stray on the Ivel Way, As though at home there were spectres rife? From first to last 'twas a proud career! And your sunny years with a gracious wife Have brought you a daughter dear. “I watched her to-day; a more comely maid, As she danced in her muslin bowed with blue, Round a Hintock maypole never gayed.” —“Aye, aye; I watched her this day, too, As it happens,” the Sergeant said. “My daughter is now,” he again began, “Of just such an age as one I knew When we of the Line, the Forlorn-hope van, On an August morning—a chosen few— Stormed San Sebastian. “She's a score less three; so about was she— The maiden I wronged in Peninsular days. . . . You may prate of your prowess in lusty times, But as years gnaw inward you blink your bays, And see too well your crimes! “We'd stormed it at night, by the flapping light Of burning towers, and the mortar's boom: We'd topped the breach; but had failed to stay, For our files were misled by the baffling gloom; And we said we'd storm by day. “So, out of the trenches, with features set, On that hot, still morning, in measured pace, Our column climbed; climbed higher yet, Past the fauss'bray, scarp, up the curtain-face, And along the parapet. “From the batteried hornwork the cannoneers Hove crashing balls of iron fire; On the shaking gap mount the volunteers In files, and as they mount expire Amid curses, groans, and cheers. “Five hours did we storm, five hours re-form, As Death cooled those hot blood pricked on; Till our cause was helped by a woe within: They were blown from the summit we'd leapt upon, And madly we entered in. “On end for plunder, 'mid rain and thunder That burst with the lull of our cannonade, We vamped the streets in the stifling air— Our hunger unsoothed, our thirst unstayed— And ransacked the buildings there. “From the shady vaults of their walls of white We rolled rich puncheons of Spanish grape, Till at length, with the fire of the wine alight, I saw at a doorway a fair fresh shape— A woman, a sylph, or sprite. “Afeard she fled, and with heated head I pursued to the chamber she called her own; —When might is right no qualms deter, And having her helpless and alone I wreaked my will on her. “She raised her beseeching eyes to me, And I heard the words of prayer she sent In her own soft language. . . . Fatefully I copied those eyes for my punishment In begetting the girl you see! “So, to-day I stand with a God-set brand Like Cain's, when he wandered from kindred's ken. . . . I served through the war that made Europe free; I wived me in peace-year. But, hid from men, I bear that mark on me. “Maybe we shape our offspring's guise From fancy, or we know not what, And that no deep impression dies,— For the mother of my child is not The mother of her eyes. “And I nightly stray on the Ivel Way As though at home there were spectres rife; I delight me not in my proud career; And 'tis coals of fire that a gracious wife Should have brought me a daughter dear!” THE STRANGER'S SONG (As sung by Mr. Charles Charrington in the play of “The Three Wayfarers”) O my trade it is the rarest one, Simple shepherds all— My trade is a sight to see; For my customers I tie, and take 'em up on high, And waft 'em to a far countree! My tools are but common ones, Simple shepherds all— My tools are no sight to see: A little hempen string, and a post whereon to swing. Are implements enough for me! To-morrow is my working day, Simple shepherds all— To-morrow is a working day for me: For the farmer's sheep is slain, and the lad who did it ta'en, And on his soul may God ha' mer-cy! Printed in “The Three Strangers,” 1883. THE BURGHERS (17??) The sun had wheeled from Grey's to Dammer's Crest, And still I mused on that Thing imminent: At length I sought the High-street to the West. The level flare raked pane and pediment And my wrecked face, and shaped my nearing friend Like one of those the Furnace held unshent. “I've news concerning her,” he said. “Attend. They fly to-night at the late moon's first gleam: Watch with thy steel: two righteous thrusts will end Her shameless visions and his passioned dream. I'll watch with thee, to testify thy wrong— To aid, maybe.—Law consecrates the scheme.” I started, and we paced the flags along Till I replied: “Since it has come to this I'll do it! But alone. I can be strong.” Three hours past Curfew, when the Froom's mild hiss Reigned sole, undulled by whirr of merchandize, From Pummery-Tout to where the Gibbet is, I crossed my pleasaunce hard by Glyd'path Rise, And stood beneath the wall. Eleven strokes went, And to the door they came, contrariwise, And met in clasp so close I had but bent My lifted blade on either to have let Their two souls loose upon the firmament. But something held my arm. “A moment yet As pray-time ere you wantons die!” I said; And then they saw me. Swift her gaze was set With eye and cry of love illimited Upon her Heart-king. Never upon me Had she thrown look of love so thoroughsped! . . . At once she flung her faint form shieldingly On his, against the vengeance of my vows; The which o'erruling, her shape shielded he. Blanked by such love, I stood as in a drowse, And the slow moon edged from the upland nigh, My sad thoughts moving thuswise: “I may house And I may husband her, yet what am I But licensed tyrant to this bonded pair? Says Charity, Do as ye would be done by.” . . . Hurling my iron to the bushes there, I bade them stay. And, as if brain and breast Were passive, they walked with me to the stair. Inside the house none watched; and on we prest Before a mirror, in whose gleam I read Her beauty, his,—and mine own mien unblest; Till at her room I turned. “Madam,” I said, “Have you the wherewithal for this? Pray speak. Love fills no cupboard. You'll need daily bread.” “We've nothing, sire,” she lipped; “and nothing seek. 'Twere base in me to rob my lord unware; Our hands will earn a pittance week by week.” And next I saw she had piled her raiment rare Within the garde-robes, and her household purse, Her jewels, her least lace of personal wear; And stood in homespun. Now grown wholly hers, I handed her the gold, her jewels all, And him the choicest of her robes diverse. “I'll take you to the doorway in the wall, And then adieu,” I told them. “Friends, withdraw.” They did so; and she went—beyond recall. And as I paused beneath the arch I saw Their moonlit figures—slow, as in surprise— Descend the slope, and vanish on the haw. “‘Fool,’ some will say,” I thought.—“But who is wise, Save God alone, to weigh my reasons why?” —“Hast thou struck home?” came with the boughs' night-sighs. It was my friend. “I have struck well. They fly, But carry wounds that none can cicatrize.” —“Not mortal?” said he. “Lingering—worse,” said I. LEIPZIG (1813) Scene.—The Master-tradesmen's Parlour at the Old Ship Inn, Casterbridge. Evening. “Old Norbert with the flat blue cap— A German said to be— Why let your pipe die on your lap, Your eyes blink absently?” —“Ah! . . . Well, I had thought till my cheek was wet Of my mother—her voice and mien When she used to sing and pirouette, And tap the tambourine “To the march that yon street-fiddler plies: She told me 'twas the same She'd heard from the trumpets, when the Allies Burst on her home like flame. “My father was one of the German Hussars, My mother of Leipzig; but he, Being quartered here, fetched her at close of the wars, And a Wessex lad reared me. “And as I grew up, again and again She'd tell, after trilling that air, Of her youth, and the battles on Leipzig plain And of all that was suffered there! . . . “—'Twas a time of alarms. Three Chiefs-at-arms Combined them to crush One, And by numbers' might, for in equal fight He stood the matched of none. “Carl Schwarzenberg was of the plot, And Blücher, prompt and prow, And Jean the Crown-Prince Bernadotte: Buonaparte was the foe. “City and plain had felt his reign From the North to the Middle Sea, And he'd now sat down in the noble town Of the King of Saxony. “October's deep dew its wet gossamer threw Upon Leipzig's lawns, leaf-strewn, Where lately each fair avenue Wrought shade for summer noon. “To westward two dull rivers crept Through miles of marsh and slough, Whereover a streak of whiteness swept— The Bridge of Lindenau. “Hard by, in the City, the One, care-tossed, Sat pondering his shrunken power; And without the walls the hemming host Waxed denser every hour. “He had speech that night on the morrow's designs With his chiefs by the bivouac fire, While the belt of flames from the enemy's lines Flared nigher him yet and nigher. “Three rockets then from the girdling trine Told, ‘Ready!’ As they rose Their flashes seemed his Judgment-Sign For bleeding Europe's woes. “'Twas seen how the French watch-fires that night Glowed still and steadily; And the Three rejoiced, for they read in the sight That the One disdained to flee. . . . “—Five hundred guns began the affray On next day morn at nine; Such mad and mangling cannon-play Had never torn human line. “Around the town three battles beat, Contracting like a gin; As nearer marched the million feet Of columns closing in. “The first battle nighed on the low Southern side; The second by the Western way; The nearing of the third on the North was heard; —The French held all at bay. “Against the first band did the Emperor stand; Against the second stood Ney; Marmont against the third gave the order-word: —Thus raged it throughout the day. “Fifty thousand sturdy souls on those trampled plains and knolls, Who met the dawn hopefully, And were lotted their shares in a quarrel not theirs, Dropt then in their agony. “‘O,’ the old folks said, ‘ye Preachers stern! O so-called Christian time! When will men's swords to ploughshares turn? When come the promised prime?’ . . . “—The clash of horse and man which that day began, Closed not as evening wore; And the morrow's armies, rear and van, Still mustered more and more. “From the City towers the Confederate Powers Were eyed in glittering lines, And up from the vast a murmuring passed As from a wood of pines. “‘'Tis well to cover a feeble skill By numbers' might!’ scoffed He; ‘But give me a third of their strength, I'd fill Half Hell with their soldiery!’ “All that day raged the war they waged, And again dumb night held reign, Save that ever upspread from the dank deathbed A miles-wide pant of pain. “Hard had striven brave Ney, the true Bertrand, Victor, and Augereau, Bold Poniatowski, and Lauriston, To stay their overthrow; “But, as in the dream of one sick to death There comes a narrowing room That pens him, body and limbs and breath, To wait a hideous doom, “So to Napoleon, in the hush That held the town and towers Through these dire nights, a creeping crush Seemed borne in with the hours. “One road to the rearward, and but one, Did fitful Chance allow; 'Twas where the Pleiss' and Elster run— The Bridge of Lindenau. “The nineteenth dawned. Down street and Platz The wasted French sank back, Stretching long lines across the Flats And on the bridgeway track: “When there surged on the sky an earthen wave, And stones, and men, as though Some rebel churchyard crew updrave Their sepulchres from below. “To Heaven is blown Bridge Lindenau; Wrecked regiments reel therefrom; And rank and file in masses plough The sullen Elster-Strom. “A gulf was Lindenau; and dead Were fifties, hundreds, tens; And every current rippled red With Marshal's blood and men's. “The smart Macdonald swam therein, And barely won the verge; Bold Poniatowski plunged him in Never to re-emerge. “Then stayed the strife. The remnants wound Their Rhineward way pell-mell; And thus did Leipzig City sound An Empire's passing bell; “While in cavalcade, with band and blade, Came Marshals, Princes, Kings; And the town was theirs. . . . Ay, as simple maid, My mother saw these things! “And whenever those notes in the street begin, I recall her, and that far scene, And her acting of how the Allies marched in, And her tap of the tambourine!” THE PEASANT'S CONFESSION “Si le maréchal Grouchy avait été rejoint par l'officier que Napoléon lui avait expédié la veille à dix heures du soir, toute question eût disparu. Mais cet officier n'était point parvenu à sa destination, ainsi que le maréchal n'a cessé de l'affirmer toute sa vie, et il faut l'en croire, car autrement il n'aurait eu aucune raison pour hésiter. Cet officier avait-il été pris? avait-il passé à l'ennemi? C'est ce qu'on a toujours ignoré.” —Thiers, Histoire de l' Empire. “Waterloo.” Good Father! . . . It was eve in middle June, And war was waged anew By great Napoleon, who for years had strewn Men's bones all Europe through. Three nights ere this, with columned corps he'd cross'd The Sambre at Charleroi, To move on Brussels, where the English host Dallied in Parc and Bois. The yestertide we'd heard the gloomy gun Growl through the long-sunned day From Quatre-Bras and Ligny; till the dun Twilight suppressed the fray; Albeit therein—as lated tongues bespoke— Brunswick's high heart was drained, And Prussia's Line and Landwehr, though unbroke, Stood cornered and constrained. And at next noon-time Grouchy slowly passed With thirty thousand men: We hoped thenceforth no army, small or vast, Would trouble us again. My hut lay deeply in a vale recessed, And never a soul seemed nigh When, reassured at length, we went to rest— My children, wife, and I. But what was this that broke our humble ease? What noise, above the rain, Above the dripping of the poplar trees That smote along the pane? —A call of mastery, bidding me arise, Compelled me to the door, At which a horseman stood in martial guise— Splashed—sweating from every pore. Had I seen Grouchy! Yes? What track took he? Could I lead thither on?— Fulfilment would ensure much gold for me, Perhaps more gifts anon. “I bear the Emperor's mandate,” then he said, “Charging the Marshal straight To strike between the double host ahead Ere they co-operate, “Engaging Blücher till the Emperor put Lord Wellington to flight, And next the Prussians. This to set afoot Is my emprise to-night.” I joined him in the mist; but, pausing, sought To estimate his say. Grouchy had made for Wavre; and yet, on thought, I did not lead that way. I mused: “If Grouchy thus and thus be told, The clash comes sheer hereon; My farm is stript. While, as for gifts of gold, Money the French have none. “Grouchy unwarned, moreo'er, the English win, And mine is left to me— They buy, not borrow.”—Hence did I begin To lead him treacherously. And as we edged Joidoigne with cautious view Dawn pierced the humid air; And still I easted with him, though I knew Never marched Grouchy there. Near Ottignies we passed, across the Dyle (Lim'lette left far aside), And thence direct toward Pervez and Noville Through green grain, till he cried: “I doubt thy conduct, man! no track is here— I doubt thy gagèd word!” Thereat he scowled on me, and prancing near, He pricked me with his sword. “Nay, Captain, hold! We skirt, not trace the course Of Grouchy,” said I then: “As we go, yonder went he, with his force Of thirty thousand men.” —At length noon nighed; when west, from Saint-John's-Mound, A hoarse artillery boomed, And from Saint-Lambert's upland, chapel-crowned, The Prussian squadrons loomed. Then leaping to the wet wild path we had kept, “My mission fails!” he cried; “Too late for Grouchy now to intercept, For, peasant, you have lied!” He turned to pistol me. I sprang, and drew The sabre from his flank, And 'twixt his nape and shoulder, ere he knew, I struck, and dead he sank. I hid him deep in nodding rye and oat— His shroud green stalks and loam; His requiem the corn-blade's husky note— And then I hastened home. . . . —Two armies writhe in coils of red and blue, And brass and iron clang From Goumont, past the front of Waterloo, To Pap'lotte and Smohain. The Guard Imperial wavered on the height; The Emperor's face grew glum; “I sent,” he said, “to Grouchy yesternight, And yet he does not come!” 'Twas then, Good Father, that the French espied, Streaking the summer land, The men of Blücher. But the Emperor cried, “Grouchy is now at hand!” And meanwhile Vand'leur, Vivian, Maitland, Kempt, Met d'Erlon, Friant, Ney; But Grouchy—mis-sent, blamed, yet blame-exempt— Grouchy was far away. By even, slain or struck, Michel the strong, Bold Travers, Dnop, Delord, Smart Guyot, Reil-le, l'Heriter, Friant, Scattered that champaign o'er. Fallen likewise wronged Duhesme, and skilled Lobau Did that red sunset see; Colbert, Legros, Blancard! . . . And of the foe Picton and Ponsonby; With Gordon, Canning, Blackman, Ompteda, L'Estrange, Delancey, Packe, Grose, D'Oyly, Stables, Morice, Howard, Hay, Von Schwerin, Watzdorf, Boek, Smith, Phelips, Fuller, Lind, and Battersby, And hosts of ranksmen round. . . . Memorials linger yet to speak to thee Of those that bit the ground! The Guards' last column yielded; dykes of dead Lay between vale and ridge, As, thinned yet closing, faint yet fierce, they sped In packs to Genappe Bridge. Safe was my stock; my capple cow unslain; Intact each cock and hen; But Grouchy far at Wavre all day had lain, And thirty thousand men. O Saints, had I but lost my earing corn And saved the cause once prized! O Saints, why such false witness had I borne When late I'd sympathized! . . . So now, being old, my children eye askance My slowly dwindling store, And crave my mite; till, worn with tarriance, I care for life no more. To Almighty God henceforth I stand confessed, And Virgin-Saint Marie; O Michael, John, and Holy Ones in rest, Entreat the Lord for me! THE ALARM (TRADITIONAL) In Memory of one of the Writer's Family who was a Volunteer during the War with Napoleon In a ferny byway Near the great South-Wessex Highway, A homestead raised its breakfast-smoke aloft; The dew-damps still lay steamless, for the sun had made no skyway, And twilight cloaked the croft. It was almost past conceiving Here, where woodbines hung inweaving, That quite closely hostile armaments might steer, Save from seeing in the porchway a fair woman mutely grieving, And a harnessed Volunteer. In haste he'd flown there To his comely wife alone there, While marching south hard by, to still her fears, For she soon would be a mother, and few messengers were known there In these campaigning years. 'Twas time to be Good-bying, Since the assembly-hour was nighing In royal George's town at six that morn; And betwixt its wharves and this retreat were ten good miles of hieing Ere ring of bugle-horn. “I've laid in food, Dear, And broached the spiced and brewed, Dear; And if our July hope should antedate, Let the char-wench mount and gallop by the halterpath and wood, Dear, And fetch assistance straight. “As for Buonaparte, forget him; He's not like to land! But let him, Those strike with aim who strike for wives and sons! And the war-boats built to float him; 'twere but wanted to upset him A slat from Nelson's guns! “But, to assure thee, And of creeping fears to cure thee, If he should be rumoured anchoring in the Road, Drive with the nurse to Kingsbere; and let nothing thence allure thee Till we have him safe-bestowed. “Now, to turn to marching matters:— I've my knapsack, firelock, spatters, Crossbelts, priming-horn, stock, bay'net, blackball, clay, Pouch, magazine, and flint-box that at every quick-step clatters;— My heart, Dear; that must stay!” —With breathings broken Farewell was kissed unspoken, And they parted there as morning stroked the panes; And the Volunteer went on, and turned, and twirled his glove for token, And took the coastward lanes. When above He'th Hills he found him, He saw, on gazing round him, The Barrow-Beacon burning—burning low, As if, perhaps, enkindled ever since he'd homeward bound him; And it meant: Expect the Foe! Leaving the byway, He entered on the highway, Where were cars and chariots, faring fast inland; “He's anchored, Soldier!” shouted some: “God save thee, marching thy way, Th'lt front him on the strand!” He slowed; he stopped; he paltered Awhile with self, and faltered, “Why courting misadventure shoreward roam? To Molly, surely! Seek the woods with her till times have altered; Charity favours home. “Else, my denying He'd come, she'll read as lying— Think the Barrow-Beacon must have met my eyes— That my words were not unwareness, but deceit of her, while vying In deeds that jeopardize. “At home is stocked provision, And to-night, without suspicion, We might bear it with us to a covert near; Such sin, to save a childing wife, would earn it Christ's remission, Though none forgive it here!” While he stood thinking, A little bird, perched drinking Among the crowfoot tufts the river bore, Was tangled in their stringy arms and fluttered, almost sinking Near him, upon the moor. He stepped in, reached, and seized it, And, preening, had released it But that a thought of Holy Writ occurred, And Signs Divine ere battle, till it seemed him Heaven had pleased it As guide to send the bird. “O Lord, direct me! . . . Doth Duty now expect me To march a-coast, or guard my weak ones near? Give this bird a flight according, that I thence learn to elect me The southward or the rear.” He loosed his clasp; when, rising, The bird—as if surmising— Bore due to southward, crossing by the Froom, And Durnover Great Field and Fort, the soldier clear advising— Prompted he deemed by Whom. Then on he panted By grim Mai-Don, and slanted Up the steep Ridge-way, hearkening between whiles; Till nearing coast and harbour he beheld the shore-line planted With Foot and Horse for miles. Mistrusting not the omen, He gained the beach, where Yeomen Militia, Fencibles and Pikemen bold, With Regulars in thousands, were enmassed to meet the Foemen, Whose fleet had not yet shoaled. Captain and Colonel, Sere Generals, Ensigns vernal, Were there; of neighbour-natives, Michel, Smith, Meggs, Bingham, Gambier, Cunningham, to face the said nocturnal Swoop on their land and kith. But Buonaparte still tarried: His project had miscarried; At the last hour, equipped for victory, The fleet had paused; his subtle combinations had been parried By British strategy. Homeward returning Anon, no beacons burning, No alarms, the Volunteer, in modest bliss, Te Deum sang with wife and friends: “We praise Thee, Lord, discerning That Thou hast helped in this!” HER DEATH AND AFTER The summons was urgent: and forth I went— By the way of the Western Wall, so drear On that winter night, and sought a gate, Where one, by Fate, Lay dying that I held dear. And there, as I paused by her tenement, And the trees shed on me their rime and hoar, I thought of the man who had left her lone— Him who made her his own When I loved her, long before. The rooms within had the piteous shine That home-things wear when there's aught amiss; From the stairway floated the rise and fall Of an infant's call, Whose birth had brought her to this. Her life was the price she would pay for that whine— For a child by the man she did not love. “But let that rest for ever,” I said, And bent my tread To the bedchamber above. She took my hand in her thin white own, And smiled her thanks—though nigh too weak— And made them a sign to leave us there, Then faltered, ere She could bring herself to speak. “Just to see you—before I go—he'll condone Such a natural thing now my time's not much— When Death is so near it hustles hence All passioned sense Between woman and man as such! “My husband is absent. As heretofore The City detains him. But, in truth, He has not been kind. . . . I will speak no blame, But—the child is lame; O, I pray she may reach his ruth! “Forgive past days—I can say no more— Maybe had we wed you would now repine! . . . But I treated you ill. I was punished. Farewell! —Truth shall I tell? Would the child were yours and mine! “As a wife I was true. But, such my unease That, could I insert a deed back in Time, I'd make her yours, to secure your care; And the scandal bear, And the penalty for the crime!” —When I had left, and the swinging trees Rang above me, as lauding her candid say, Another was I. Her words were enough: Came smooth, came rough, I felt I could live my day. Next night she died; and her obsequies In the Field of Tombs where the earthworks frowned Had her husband's heed. His tendance spent, I often went And pondered by her mound. All that year and the next year whiled, And I still went thitherward in the gloam; But the Town forgot her and her nook, And her husband took Another Love to his home. And the rumour flew that the lame lone child Whom she wished for its safety child of mine, Was treated ill when offspring came Of the new-made dame, And marked a more vigorous line. A smarter grief within me wrought Than even at loss of her so dear— That the being whose soul my soul suffused Had a child ill-used, While I dared not interfere! One eve as I stood at my spot of thought In the white-stoned Garth, brooding thus her wrong, Her husband neared; and to shun his nod By her hallowed sod I went from the tombs among To the Cirque of the Gladiators which faced— That haggard mark of Imperial Rome, Whose Pagan echoes mock the chime Of our Christian time From its hollows of chalk and loam. The sun's gold touch was scarce displaced From the vast Arena where men once bled, When her husband followed; bowed; half-passed With lip upcast; Then halting sullenly said: “It is noised that you visit my first wife's tomb. Now, I gave her an honoured name to bear While living, when dead. So I've claim to ask By what right you task My patience by vigiling there? “There's decency even in death, I assume; Preserve it, sir, and keep away; For the mother of my first-born you Show mind undue! —Sir, I've nothing more to say.” A desperate stroke discerned I then— God pardon—or pardon not—the lie; She had sighed that she wished (lest the child should pine Of slights) 'twere mine, So I said: “But the father I. “That you thought it yours is the way of men; But I won her troth long ere your day: You learnt how, in dying, she summoned me? 'Twas in fealty. —Sir, I've nothing more to say, “Save that, if you'll hand me my little maid, I'll take her, and rear her, and spare you toil. Think it more than a friendly act none can; I'm a lonely man, While you've a large pot to boil. “If not, and you'll put it to ball or blade— To-night, to-morrow night, anywhen— I'll meet you here. . . . But think of it, And in season fit Let me hear from you again.” —Well, I went away, hoping; but nought I heard Of my stroke for the child, till there greeted me A little voice that one day came To my window-frame And babbled innocently: “My father who's not my own, sends word I'm to stay here, sir, where I belong!” Next a writing came: “Since the child was the fruit Of your lawless suit, Pray take her, to right a wrong.” And I did. And I gave the child my love, And the child loved me, and estranged us none. But compunctions loomed; for I'd harmed the dead By what I said For the good of the living one. —Yet though, God wot, I am sinner enough, And unworthy the woman who drew me so, Perhaps this wrong for her darling's good She forgives, or would, If only she could know! THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX To Jenny came a gentle youth From inland leazes lone, His love was fresh as apple-blooth By Parrett, Yeo, or Tone. And duly he entreated her To be his tender minister, And take him for her own. Now Jenny's life had hardly been A life of modesty; And few in Casterbridge had seen More loves of sorts than she From scarcely sixteen years above; Among them sundry troopers of The King's-Own Cavalry. But each with charger, sword, and gun, Had bluffed the Biscay wave; And Jenny prized her rural one For all the love he gave. She vowed to be, if they were wed, His honest wife in heart and head From bride-ale hour to grave. Wedded they were. Her husband's trust In Jenny knew no bound, And Jenny kept her pure and just, Till even malice found No sin or sign of ill to be In one who walked so decently The duteous helpmate's round. Two sons were born, and bloomed to men, And roamed, and were as not: Alone was Jenny left again As ere her mind had sought A solace in domestic joys, And ere the vanished pair of boys Were sent to sun her cot. She numbered near on sixty years, And passed as elderly, When, on a day, with flushing fears, She learnt from shouts of glee, And shine of swords, and thump of drum, Her early loves from war had come, The King's-Own Cavalry. She turned aside, and bowed her head Anigh Saint Peter's door; “Alas for chastened thoughts!” she said; “I'm faded now, and hoar, And yet those notes—they thrill me through, And those gay forms move me anew As they moved me of yore!” . . . 'Twas Christmas, and the Phœnix Inn Was lit with tapers tall, For thirty of the trooper men Had vowed to give a ball As “Theirs” had done ('twas handed down) When lying in the selfsame town Ere Buonaparté's fall. That night the throbbing “Soldier's Joy,” The measured tread and sway Of “Fancy-Lad” and “Maiden Coy,” Reached Jenny as she lay Beside her spouse; till springtide blood Seemed scouring through her like a flood That whisked the years away. She rose, arrayed, and decked her head Where the bleached hairs grew thin; Upon her cap two bows of red She fixed with hasty pin; Unheard descending to the street She trod the flags with tune-led feet, And stood before the Inn. Save for the dancers', not a sound Disturbed the icy air; No watchman on his midnight round Or traveller was there; But over All-Saints', high and bright, Pulsed to the music Sirius white, The Wain by Bullstake Square. She knocked, but found her further stride Checked by a sergeant tall: “Gay Granny, whence come you?” he cried; “This is a private ball.” —“No one has more right here than me! Ere you were born, man,” answered she, “I knew the regiment all!” “Take not the lady's visit ill!” The steward said; “for see, We lack sufficient partners still, So, prithee, let her be!” They seized and whirled her mid the maze, And Jenny felt as in the days Of her immodesty. Hour chased each hour, and night advanced; She sped as shod with wings; Each time and every time she danced— Reels, jigs, poussettes, and flings: They cheered her as she soared and swooped, (She had learnt ere art in dancing drooped From hops to slothful swings). The favourite Quick-step “Speed the Plough”— (Cross hands, cast off, and wheel)— “The Triumph,” “Sylph,” “The Row-dow-dow,” Famed “Major Malley's Reel,” “The Duke of York's,” “The Fairy Dance,” “The Bridge of Lodi” (brought from France), She beat out, toe and heel. The “Fall of Paris” clanged its close, And Peter's chime went four, When Jenny, bosom-beating, rose To seek her silent door. They tiptoed in escorting her, Lest stroke of heel or clink of spur Should break her goodman's snore. The fire that lately burnt fell slack When Ione at last was she; Her nine-and-fifty years came back; She sank upon her knee Beside the durn, and like a dart A something arrowed through her heart In shoots of agony. Their footsteps died as she leant there, Lit by the morning star Hanging above the moorland, where The aged elm-rows are; As overnight, from Pummery Ridge To Maembury Ring and Standfast Bridge No life stirred, near or far. Though inner mischief worked amain, She reached her husband's side; Where, toil-weary, as he had lain Beneath the patchwork pied When forthward yestereve she crept, And as unwitting, still he slept Who did in her confide. A tear sprang as she turned and viewed His features free from guile; She kissed him long, as when, just wooed, She chose his domicile. She felt she would give more than life To be the single-hearted wife That she had been erstwhile. . . . Time wore to six. Her husband rose And struck the steel and stone; He glanced at Jenny, whose repose Seemed deeper than his own. With dumb dismay, on closer sight, He gathered sense that in the night, Or morn, her soul had flown. When told that some too mighty strain For one so many-yeared Had burst her bosom's master-vein, His doubts remained unstirred. His Jenny had not left his side Betwixt the eve and morning-tide: —The King's said not a word. Well! times are not as times were then, Nor fair ones half so free; And truly they were martial men, The King's-Own Cavalry. And when they went from Casterbridge And vanished over Mellstock Ridge, 'Twas saddest morn to see. THE CASTERBRIDGE CAPTAINS (KHYBER PASS, 1842) A Tradition of J. B. L?, T. G. B?, and J. L? Three captains went to Indian wars, And only one returned: Their mate of yore, he singly wore The laurels all had earned. At home he sought the ancient aisle Wherein, untrumped of fame, The three had sat in pupilage, And each had carved his name. The names, rough-hewn, of equal size, Stood on the panel still; Unequal since.—“'Twas theirs to aim, Mine was it to fulfil!” —“Who saves his life shall lose it, friends!” Outspake the preacher then, Unweeting he his listener, who Looked at the names again. That he had come and they had been stayed Was but the chance of war: Another chance, and they had been here. And he had lain afar. Yet saw he something in the lives Of those who had ceased to live That sphered them with a majesty Which living failed to give. Transcendent triumph in return No longer lit his brain; Transcendence rayed the distant urn Where slept the fallen twain. A SIGN-SEEKER I mark the months in liveries dank and dry, The noontides many-shaped and hued; I see the nightfall shades subtrude, And hear the monotonous hours clang negligently by. I view the evening bonfires of the sun On hills where morning rains have hissed; The eyeless countenance of the mist Pallidly rising when the summer droughts are done. I have seen the lightning-blade, the leaping star, The cauldrons of the sea in storm, Have felt the earthquake's lifting arm, And trodden where abysmal fires and snow-cones are. I learn to prophesy the hid eclipse, The coming of eccentric orbs; To mete the dust the sky absorbs, To weigh the sun, and fix the hour each planet dips. I witness fellow earth-men surge and strive; Assemblies meet, and throb, and part; Death's sudden finger, sorrow's smart; —All the vast various moils that mean a world alive. But that I fain would wot of shuns my sense— Those sights of which old prophets tell, Those signs the general word so well As vouchsafed their unheed, denied my long suspense. In graveyard green, where his pale dust lies pent To glimpse a phantom parent, friend, Wearing his smile, and “Not the end!” Outbreathing softly: that were blest enlightenment: Or, if a dead Love's lips, whom dreams reveal When midnight imps of King Decay Delve sly to solve me back to clay, Should leave some print to prove her spirit-kisses real; Or, when Earth's Frail lie bleeding of her Strong, If some Recorder, as in Writ, Near to the weary scene should flit And drop one plume as pledge that Heaven inscrolls the wrong —There are who, rapt to heights of trancelike trust, These tokens claim to feel and see, Read radiant hints of times to be— Of heart to heart returning after dust to dust. Such scope is granted not to lives like mine . . . I have lain in dead men's beds, have walked The tombs of those with whom I had talked, Called many a gone and goodly one to shape a sign, And panted for response. But none replies; No warnings loom, nor whisperings To open out my limitings, And Nescience mutely muses: When a man falls he lies. MY CICELY (17??) “Alive?”—And I leapt in my wonder, Was faint of my joyance, And grasses and grove shone in garments Of glory to me. “She lives, in a plenteous well-being, To-day as aforehand; The dead bore the name—though a rare one— The name that bore she.” She lived . . . I, afar in the city Of frenzy-led factions, Had squandered green years and maturer In bowing the knee To Baals illusive and specious, Till chance had there voiced me That one I loved vainly in nonage Had ceased her to be. The passion the planets had scowled on, And change had let dwindle, Her death-rumour smartly relifted To full apogee. I mounted a steed in the dawning With acheful remembrance, And made for the ancient West Highway To far Exonb'ry. Passing heaths, and the House of Long Sieging, I neared the thin steeple That tops the fair fane of Poore's olden Episcopal see; And, changing anew my blown bearer, I traversed the downland Whereon the bleak hill-graves of Chieftains Bulge barren of tree; And still sadly onward I followed That Highway the Icen, Which trails its pale riband down Wessex By lynchet and lea. Along through the Stour-bordered Forum, Where Legions had wayfared, And where the slow river-face glasses Its green canopy, And by Weatherbury Castle, and thencefrom Through Casterbridge held I Still on, to entomb her my mindsight Saw stretched pallidly. No highwayman's trot blew the night-wind To me so life-weary, But only the creak of a gibbet Or waggoner's jee. Triple-ramparted Maidon gloomed grayly Above me from southward, And north the hill-fortress of Eggar, And square Pummerie. The Nine-Pillared Cromlech, the Bride-streams, The Axe, and the Otter I passed, to the gate of the city Where Exe scents the sea; Till, spent, in the graveacre pausing, I learnt 'twas not my Love To whom Mother Church had just murmured A last lullaby. —“Then, where dwells the Canon's kinswoman, My friend of aforetime?” I asked, to disguise my heart-heavings And new ecstasy. “She wedded.”—“Ah!”—“Wedded beneath her— She keeps the stage-hostel Ten miles hence, beside the great Highway— The famed Lions-Three. “Her spouse was her lackey—no option 'Twixt wedlock and worse things; A lapse over-sad for a lady Of her pedigree!” I shuddered, said nothing, and wandered To shades of green laurel: More ghastly than death were these tidings Of life's irony! For, on my ride down I had halted Awhile at the Lions, And her—her whose name had once opened My heart as a key— I'd looked on, unknowing, and witnessed Her jests with the tapsters, Her liquor-fired face, her thick accents In naming her fee. “O God, why this seeming derision!” I cried in my anguish: “O once Loved, O fair Unforgotten— That Thing—meant it thee! “Inurned and at peace, lost but sainted, Were grief I could compass; Depraved—'tis for Christ's poor dependent A cruel decree!” I backed on the Highway; but passed not The hostel. Within there Too mocking to Love's re-expression Was Time's repartee! Uptracking where Legions had wayfared By cromlechs unstoried, And lynchets, and sepultured Chieftains, In self-colloquy, A feeling stirred in me and strengthened That she was not my Love, But she of the garth, who lay rapt in Her long reverie. And thence till to-day I persuade me That this was the true one; That Death stole intact her young dearness And innocency. Frail-witted, illuded they call me; I may be. Far better To dream than to own the debasement Of sweet Cicely. Moreover I rate it unseemly To hold that kind Heaven Could work such device—to her ruin And my misery. So, lest I disturb my choice vision, I shun the West Highway, Even now, when the knaps ring with rhythms From blackbird and bee; And feel that with slumber half-conscious She rests in the church-hay, Her spirit unsoiled as in youth-time When lovers were we. HER IMMORTALITY Upon a noon I pilgrimed through A pasture, mile by mile, Unto the place where last I saw My dead Love's living smile. And sorrowing I lay me down Upon the heated sod: It seemed as if my body pressed The very ground she trod. I lay, and thought; and in a trance She came and stood thereby— The same, even to the marvellous ray That used to light her eye. “You draw me, and I come to you, My faithful one,” she said, In voice that had the moving tone It bore ere she was wed. “Seven years have circled since I died: Few now remember me; My husband clasps another bride: My children's love has she. “My brethren, sisters, and my friends Care not to meet my sprite: Who prized me most I did not know Till I passed down from sight.” I said: “My days are lonely here; I need thy smile alway: I'll use this night my ball or blade, And join thee ere the day.” A tremor stirred her tender lips, Which parted to dissuade: “That cannot be, O friend,” she cried; “Think, I am but a Shade! “A Shade but in its mindful ones Has immortality; By living, me you keep alive, By dying you slay me. “In you resides my single power Of sweet continuance here; On your fidelity I count Through many a coming year.” —I started through me at her plight, So suddenly confessed: Dismissing late distaste for life, I craved its bleak unrest. “I will not die, my One of all!— To lengthen out thy days I'll guard me from minutest harms That may invest my ways!” She smiled and went. Since then she comes Oft when her birth-moon climbs, Or at the seasons' ingresses, Or anniversary times; But grows my grief. When I surcease, Through whom alone lives she, Her spirit ends its living lease, Never again to be! THE IVY-WIFE I longed to love a full-boughed beech And be as high as he: I stretched an arm within his reach, And signalled unity. But with his drip he forced a breach, And tried to poison me. I gave the grasp of partnership To one of other race— A plane: he barked him strip by strip From upper bough to base; And me therewith; for gone my grip, My arms could not enlace. In new affection next I strove To coll an ash I saw, And he in trust received my love; Till with my soft green claw I cramped and bound him as I wove . . . Such was my love: ha-ha! By this I gained his strength and height Without his rivalry. But in my triumph I lost sight Of afterhaps. Soon he, Being bark-bound, flagged, snapped, fell outright, And in his fall felled me! A MEETING WITH DESPAIR As evening shaped I found me on a moor Sight shunned to entertain: The black lean land, of featureless contour, Was like a tract in pain. “This scene, like my own life,” I said, “is one Where many glooms abide; Toned by its fortune to a deadly dun— Lightless on every side.” I glanced aloft and halted, pleasure-caught To see the contrast there: The ray-lit clouds gleamed glory; and I thought, “There's solace everywhere!” Then bitter self-reproaches as I stood I dealt me silently As one perverse, misrepresenting Good In graceless mutiny. Against the horizon's dim-discernèd wheel A form rose, strange of mould: That he was hideous, hopeless, I could feel Rather than could behold. “'Tis a dead spot, where even the light lies spent To darkness!” croaked the Thing. “Not if you look aloft!” said I, intent On my new reasoning. “Yea—but await awhile!” he cried. “Ho-ho!— Now look aloft and see!” I looked. There, too, sat night: Heaven's radiant show Had gone that heartened me. UNKNOWING When, soul in soul reflected, We breathed an æthered air, When we neglected All things elsewhere, And left the friendly friendless To keep our love aglow, We deemed it endless . . , —We did not know! When panting passion-goaded, We planned to hie away, But, unforeboded, All the long day The storm so pierced and pattered That none could up and go, Our lives seemed shattered . . . —We did not know! When I found you helpless lying, And you waived my long misprise, And swore me, dying, In phantom-guise To wing to me when grieving, And touch away my woe, We kissed, believing . . . —We did not know! But though, your powers outreckoning, You tarry dead and dumb, Or scorn my beckoning, And will not come: And I say, “Why thus inanely Brood on her memory so!” I say it vainly— I feel and know! FRIENDS BEYOND William Dewy, Tranter Reuben, Farmer Ledlow late at plough, Robert's kin, and John's, and Ned's, And the Squire, and Lady Susan, lie in Mellstock churchyard now! “Gone,” I call them, gone for good, that group of local hearts and heads; Yet at mothy curfew-tide, And at midnight when the noon-heat breathes it back from walls and leads, They've a way of whispering to me—fellow-wight who yet abide— In the muted, measured note Of a ripple under archways, or a lone cave's stillicide: “We have triumphed: this achievement turns the bane to antidote, Unsuccesses to success, Many thought-worn eves and morrows to a morrow free of thought. “No more need we corn and clothing, feel of old terrestial stress; Chill detraction stirs no sigh; Fear of death has even bygone us: death gave all that we possess.” W. D.— “Ye mid burn the old bass-viol that I set such value by.”Squire.— “You may hold the manse in fee, You may wed my spouse, may let my children's memory of me die.” Lady S.— “You may have my rich brocades, my laces; take each household key; Ransack coffer, desk, bureau; Quiz the few poor treasures hid there, con the letters kept by me.” Far.— “Ye mid zell my favourite heifer, ye mid let the charlock grow, Foul the grinterns, give up thrift.”Far. Wife.— “If ye break my best blue china, children, I shan't care or ho.” All.— “We've no wish to hear the tidings, how the people's fortunes shift; What your daily doings are; Who are wedded, born, divided; if your lives beat slow or swift. “Curious not the least are we if our intents you make or mar, If you quire to our old tune, If the City stage still passes, if the weirs still roar afar.” —Thus, with very gods' composure, freed those crosses late and soon Which, in life, the Trine allow (Why, none witteth), and ignoring all that haps beneath the moon, William Dewy, Tranter Reuben, Farmer Ledlow late at plough, Robert's kin, and John's, and Ned's, And the Squire, and Lady Susan, murmur mildly to me now. TO OUTER NATURE Show thee as I thought thee When I early sought thee, Omen-scouting, All undoubting Love alone had wrought thee— Wrought thee for my pleasure, Planned thee as a measure For expounding And resounding Glad things that men treasure. O for but a moment Of that old endowment— Light to gaily See thy daily Iris-hued embowment! But such re-adorning Time forbids with scorning— Makes me see things Cease to be things They were in my morning. Fad'st thou, glow-forsaken, Darkness-overtaken! Thy first sweetness, Radiance, meetness, None shall re-awaken. Why not sempiternal Thou and I? Our vernal Brightness keeping, Time outleaping; Passed the hodiernal! THOUGHTS OF PHENA AT NEWS OF HER DEATH Not a line of her writing have I, Not a thread of her hair, No mark of her late time as dame in her dwelling, whereby I may picture her there; And in vain do I urge my unsight To conceive my lost prize At her close, whom I knew when her dreams were upbrimming with light, And with laughter her eyes. What scenes spread around her last days, Sad, shining, or dim? Did her gifts and compassions enray and enarch her sweet ways With an aureate nimb? Or did life-light decline from her years, And mischances control Her full day-star; unease, or regret, or forebodings, or fears Disennoble her soul? Thus I do but the phantom retain Of the maiden of yore As my relic; yet haply the best of her—fined in my brain It may be the more That no line of her writing have I, Nor a thread of her hair, No mark of her late time as dame in her dwelling, whereby I may picture her there. March 1890. MIDDLE-AGE ENTHUSIASMS TO M. H. We passed where flag and flower Signalled a jocund throng; We said: “Go to, the hour Is apt!”—and joined the song; And, kindling, laughed at life and care, Although we knew no laugh lay there. We walked where shy birds stood Watching us, wonder-dumb; Their friendship met our mood; We cried: “We'll often come: We'll come morn, noon, eve, everywhen!” —We doubted we should come again. We joyed to see strange sheens Leap from quaint leaves in shade; A secret light of greens They'd for their pleasure made. We said: “We'll set such sorts as these!” —We knew with night the wish would cease. “So sweet the place,” we said, “Its tacit tales so dear, Our thoughts, when breath has sped, Will meet and mingle here!” . . . “Words!” mused we. “Passed the mortal door Our thoughts will reach this nook no more.” IN A WOOD From “The Woodlanders” Pale beech and pine so blue, Set in one clay, Bough to bough cannot you Live out your day? When the rains skim and skip, Why mar sweet comradeship, Blighting with poison-drip Neighbourly spray? Heart-halt and spirit-lame, City-opprest, Unto this wood I came As to a nest; Dreaming that sylvan peace Offered the harrowed ease— Nature a soft release From men's unrest. But, having entered in, Great growths and small Show them to men akin— Combatants all! Sycamore shoulders oak, Bines the slim sapling yoke, Ivy-spun halters choke Elms stout and tall. Touches from ash, O wych, Sting you like scorn! You, too, brave hollies, twitch Sidelong from thorn. Even the rank poplars bear Lothly a rival's air, Cankering in black despair If overborne. Since, then, no grace I find Taught me of trees, Turn I back to my kind, Worthy as these. There at least smiles abound, There discourse trills around, There, now and then, are found Life-loyalties. 1887: 1896. TO A LADY OFFENDED BY A BOOK OF THE WRITER'S Now that my page is exiled,—doomed, maybe, Never to press thy cosy cushions more, Or wake thy ready Yeas as heretofore, Or stir thy gentle vows of faith in me: Knowing thy natural receptivity, I figure that, as flambeaux banish eve, My sombre image, warped by insidious heave Of those less forthright, must lose place in thee. So be it. I have borne such. Let thy dreams Of me and mine diminish day by day, And yield their space to shine of smugger things; Till I shape to thee but in fitful gleams, And then in far and feeble visitings, And then surcease. Truth will be truth alway. TO A MOTHERLESS CHILD Ah, child, thou art but half thy darling mother's; Hers couldst thou wholly be, My light in thee would outglow all in others; She would relive to me. But niggard Nature's trick of birth Bars, lest she overjoy, Renewal of the loved on earth Save with alloy. The Dame has no regard, alas, my maiden, For love and loss like mine— No sympathy with mindsight memory-laden; Only with fickle eyne. To her mechanic artistry My dreams are all unknown, And why I wish that thou couldst be But One's alone! NATURE'S QUESTIONING When I look forth at dawning, pool, Field, flock, and lonely tree, All seem to gaze at me Like chastened children sitting silent in a school; Their faces dulled, constrained, and worn, As though the master's ways Through the long teaching days Had cowed them till their early zest was overborne. Upon them stirs in lippings mere (As if once clear in call, But now scarce breathed at all)— “We wonder, ever wonder, why we find us here! “Has some Vast Imbecility, Mighty to build and blend, But impotent to tend, Framed us in jest, and left us now to hazardry? “Or come we of an Automaton Unconscious of our pains? . . . Or are we live remains Of Godhead dying downwards, brain and eye now gone? “Or is it that some high Plan betides, As yet not understood, Of Evil stormed by Good, We the Forlorn Hope over which Achievement strides?” Thus things around. No answerer I. . . Meanwhile the winds, and rains, And Earth's old glooms and pains Are still the same, and Life and Death are neighbours nigh. THE IMPERCIPIENT (AT A CATHEDRAL SERVICE) That with this bright believing band I have no claim to be, That faiths by which my comrades stand Seem fantasies to me, And mirage-mists their Shining Land, Is a strange destiny. Why thus my soul should be consigned To infelicity, Why always I must feel as blind To sights my brethren see, Why joys they've found I cannot find, Abides a mystery. Since heart of mine knows not that ease Which they know; since it be That He who breathes All's Well to these Breathes no All's-Well to me, My lack might move their sympathies And Christian charity! I am like a gazer who should mark An inland company Standing upfingered, with, “Hark! hark! The glorious distant sea!” And feel, “Alas, 'tis but yon dark And wind-swept pine to me!” Yet I would bear my shortcomings With meet tranquillity, But for the charge that blessed things I'd liefer not have be. O, doth a bird deprived of wings Go earth-bound wilfully! Enough. As yet disquiet clings About us. Rest shall we. AT AN INN When we as strangers sought Their catering care, Veiled smiles bespoke their thought Of what we were. They warmed as they opined Us more than friends— That we had all resigned For love's dear ends. And that swift sympathy With living love Which quicks the world—maybe The spheres above, Made them our ministers, Moved them to say, “Ah, God, that bliss like theirs Would flush our day!” And we were left alone As Love's own pair; Yet never the love-light shone Between us there! But that which chilled the breath Of afternoon, And palsied unto death The pane-fly's tune. The kiss their zeal foretold, And now deemed come, Came not: within his hold Love lingered numb. Why cast he on our port A bloom not ours? Why shaped us for his sport In after-hours? As we seemed we were not That day afar, And now we seem not what We aching are. O severing sea and land, O laws of men, Ere death, once let us stand As we stood then! THE SLOW NATURE (AN INCIDENT OF FROOM VALLEY) “Thy husband—poor, poor Heart!—is dead— Dead, out by Moreford Rise; A bull escaped the barton-shed, Gored him, and there he lies!” —“Ha, ha—go away! 'Tis a tale, methink, Thou joker Kit!” laughed she. “I've known thee many a year, Kit Twink, And ever hast thou fooled me!” —“But, Mistress Damon—I can swear Thy goodman John is dead! And soon th'lt hear their feet who bear His body to his bed.” So unwontedly sad was the merry man's face— That face which had long deceived— That she gazed and gazed; and then could trace The truth there; and she believed. She laid a hand on the dresser-ledge, And scanned far Egdon-side; And stood; and you heard the wind-swept sedge And the rippling Froom; till she cried: “O my chamber's untidied, unmade my bed, Though the day has begun to wear! ‘What a slovenly hussif!’ it will be said, When they all go up my stair!” She disappeared; and the joker stood Depressed by his neighbour's doom, And amazed that a wife struck to widowhood Thought first of her unkempt room. But a fortnight thence she could take no food, And she pined in a slow decay; While Kit soon lost his mournful mood And laughed in his ancient way. 1894. IN A EWELEAZE NEAR WEATHERBURY The years have gathered grayly Since I danced upon this leaze With one who kindled gaily Love's fitful ecstasies! But despite the term as teacher, I remain what I was then In each essential feature Of the fantasies of men. Yet I note the little chisel Of never-napping Time Defacing wan and grizzel The blazon of my prime. When at night he thinks me sleeping I feel him boring sly Within my bones, and heaping Quaintest pains for by-and-by. Still, I'd go the world with Beauty, I would laugh with her and sing, I would shun divinest duty To resume her worshipping. But she'd scorn my brave endeavour, She would not balm the breeze By murmuring “Thine for ever!” As she did upon this leaze. 1890. THE BRIDE-NIGHT FIRE (A WESSEX TRADITION) They had long met o' Zundays—her true love and she— And at junketings, maypoles, and flings; But she bode wi' a thirtover thirtover, cross. uncle, and he Swore by noon and by night that her goodman should be Naibour Sweatley—a wight often weak at the knee From taking o' sommat more cheerful than tea— Who tranted, tranted, traded as carrier. and moved people's things. She cried, “O pray pity me!” Nought would he hear; Then with wild rainy eyes she obeyed. She chid when her Love was for clinking off wi' her: The pa'son was told, as the season drew near, To throw over pu'pit the names of the pair As fitting one flesh to be made. The wedding-day dawned and the morning drew on; The couple stood bridegroom and bride; The evening was passed, and when midnight had gone The feasters horned, horned, sang loudly. “God save the King,” and anon The pair took their homealong homealong, homeward. ride. The lover Tim Tankens mourned heart-sick and leer leer, empty-stomached. To be thus of his darling deprived: He roamed in the dark ath'art field, mound, and mere, And, a'most without knowing it, found himself near The house of the tranter, and now of his Dear, Where the lantern-light showed 'em arrived. The bride sought her chamber so calm and so pale That a Northern had thought her resigned; But to eyes that had seen her in tidetimes tidetimes, holidays. of weal, Like the white cloud o' smoke, the red battlefield's vail, That look spak' of havoc behind. The bridegroom yet laitered a beaker to drain, Then reeled to the linhay linhay, lean-to building. for more, When the candle-snoff kindled some chaff from his grain— Flames spread, and red vlankers vlankers, fire-flakes. wi' might and wi' main Around beams, thatch, and chimley-tun chimley-tun, chimney-stack. roar. Young Tim away yond, rafted rafted, roused. up by the light, Through brimbles and underwood tears, Till he comes to the orchet, when crooping crooping, squatting down. from sight In the lewth lewth, shelter. of a codlin-tree, bivering bivering, with chattering teeth wi' fright, Wi' on'y her night-rail to cover her plight, His lonesome young Barbree appears. Her cwold little figure half-naked he views Played about by the frolicsome breeze, Her light-tripping totties, totties, feet. her ten little tooes, All bare and besprinkled wi' Fall's Fall, autumn. chilly dews, While her great gallied gallied, frightened. eyes through her hair hanging loose Shone as stars through a tardle tardle, entanglement. o' trees. She eyed him; and, as when a weir-hatch is drawn, Her tears, penned by terror afore, With a rushing of sobs in a shower were strawn, Till her power to pour 'em seemed wasted and gone From the heft heft, weight. o' misfortune she bore. “O Tim, my own Tim I must call 'ee—I will! All the world has turned round on me so! Can you help her who loved 'ee, though acting so ill? Can you pity her misery—feel for her still? When worse than her body so quivering and chill Is her heart in its winter o' woe! “I think I mid mid, might. almost ha' borne it,” she said, “Had my griefs one by one come to hand; But O, to be slave to thik husbird, ihik husbird, that rascal. for bread, And then, upon top o' that, driven to wed, And then, upon top o' that, burnt out o' bed, Is more than my nater can stand!” Like a lion 'ithin en Tim's spirit outsprung— (Tim had a great soul when his feelings were wrung)— “Feel for 'ee, dear Barbree?” he cried; And his warm working-jacket then straightway he flung Round about her, and horsed her by jerks, till she clung Like a chiel on a gipsy, her figure uphung By the sleeves that he tightly had tied. Over piggeries, and mixens, mixens, manure-heaps. and apples, and hay, They lumpered lumpered stumbled. straight into the night; And finding ere long where a halter-path halter-path, bridle-path. lay, Sighted Tim's house by dawn, on'y seen on their way By a naibour or two who were up wi' the day, But who gathered no clue to the sight. Then tender Tim Tankens he searched here and there For some garment to clothe her fair skin; But though he had breeches and waistcoats to spare, He had nothing quite seemly for Barbree to wear, Who, half shrammed shrammed, numbed. to death, stood and cried on a chair At the caddle caddle, quandary. she found herself in. There was one thing to do, and that one thing he did, He lent her some clothes of his own, And she took 'em perforce; and while swiftly she slid Them upon her Tim turned to the winder, as bid, Thinking, “O that the picter my duty keeps hid To the sight o' my eyes mid mid, might. be shown!” In the tallet tallet, loft. he stowed her; there huddied huddied, hidden. she lay, Shortening sleeves, legs, and tails to her limbs; But most o' the time in a mortal bad way, Well knowing that there'd be the divel to pay If 'twere found that, instead o' the element's prey, She was living in lodgings at Tim's. “Where's the tranter?” said men and boys; “where can he be?” “Where's the tranter?” said Barbree alone. “Where on e'th is the tranter?” said everybod-y: They sifted the dust of his perished roof-tree, And all they could find was a bone. Then the uncle cried, “Lord, pray have mercy on me!” And in terror began to repent. But before 'twas complete, and till sure she was free, Barbree drew up her loft-ladder, tight turned her key— Tim bringing up breakfast and dinner and tea— Till the news of her hiding got vent. Then followed the custom-kept rout, shout, and flare Of a skimmity-ride skimmity-ride, satirical procession with effigies. through the naibourhood, ere Folk had proof o' wold wold, old. Sweatley's decay. Whereupon decent people all stood in a stare, Saying Tim and his lodger should risk it, and pair: So he took her to church. An' some laughing lads there Cried to Tim, “After Sweatley!” She said, “I declare I stand as a maiden to-day!” Written 1866; printed 1875. HEIRESS AND ARCHITECT FOR A. W. BLOMFIELD She sought the Studios, beckoning to her side An arch-designer, for she planned to build. He was of wise contrivance, deeply skilled In every intervolve of high and wide— Well fit to be her guide. “Whatever it be,” Responded he, With cold, clear voice, and cold, clear view, “In true accord with prudent fashionings For such vicissitudes as living brings, And thwarting not the law of stable things, That will I do.” “Shape me,” she said, “high halls with tracery And open ogive-work, that scent and hue Of buds, and travelling bees, may come in through, The note of birds, and singings of the sea, For these are much to me.” “An idle whim!” Broke forth from him Whom nought could warm to gallantries: “Cede all these buds and birds, the zephyr's call, And scents, and hues, and things that falter all, And choose as best the close and surly wall, For winters freeze.” “Then frame,” she cried, “wide fronts of crystal glass, That I may show my laughter and my light— Light like the sun's by day, the stars' by night— Till rival heart-queens, envying, wail, ‘Alas, Her glory!’ as they pass.” “O maid misled!” He sternly said Whose facile foresight pierced her dire; “Where shall abide the soul when, sick of glee, It shrinks, and hides, and prays no eye may see? Those house them best who house for secrecy, For you will tire.” “A little chamber, then, with swan and dove Ranged thickly, and engrailed with rare device Of reds and purples, for a Paradise Wherein my Love may greet me, I my Love, When he shall know thereof?” “This, too, is ill,” He answered still, The man who swayed her like a shade. “An hour will come when sight of such sweet nook Would bring a bitterness too sharp to brook, When brighter eyes have won away his look; For you will fade.” Then said she faintly: “O, contrive some way— Some narrow winding turret, quite mine own, To reach a loft where I may grieve alone! It is a slight thing; hence do not, I pray, This last dear fancy slay!” “Such winding ways Fit not your days,” Said he, the man of measuring eye; “I must even fashion as the rule declares, To wit: Give space (since life ends unawares) To hale a coffined corpse adown the stairs; For you will die.” 1867. 8 Adelphi Terrace. THE TWO MEN There were two youths of equal age, Wit, station, strength, and parentage; They studied at the selfsame schools, And shaped their thoughts by common rules. One pondered on the life of man, His hopes, his ending, and began To rate the Market's sordid war As something scarce worth living for. “I'll brace to higher aims,” said he, “I'll further Truth and Purity; Thereby to mend the mortal lot And sweeten sorrow. Thrive I not, “Winning their hearts, my kind will give Enough that I may lowly live, And house my Love in some dim dell, For pleasing them and theirs so well.” Idly attired, with features wan, In secret swift he laboured on: Such press of power had brought much gold Applied to things of meaner mould. Sometimes he wished his aims had been To gather gains like other men; Then thanked his God he'd traced his track Too far for wish to drag him back. He looked down from his loft one day To where his slighted garden lay; Nettles and hemlock hid each lawn, And every flower was starved and gone He fainted in his heart, whereon He rose, and sought his plighted one, Resolved to loose her bond withal, Lest she should perish in his fall. He met her with a careless air, As though he'd ceased to find her fair, And said: “True love is dust to me; I cannot kiss: I tire of thee!” (That she might scorn him was he fain, To put her sooner out of pain; For angered love breathes quick and dies, When famished love long-lingering lies.) Once done, his soul was so betossed, It found no more the force it lost: Hope was his only drink and food, And hope extinct, decay ensued. And, living long so closely penned, He had not kept a single friend; He dwindled thin as phantoms be, And drooped to death in poverty. . . . Meantime his schoolmate had gone out To join the fortune-finding rout; He liked the winnings of the mart, But wearied of the working part. He turned to seek a privy lair, Neglecting note of garb and hair, And day by day reclined and thought How he might live by doing nought. “I plan a valued scheme” he said To some. “But lend me of your bread, And when the vast result looms nigh, In profit you shall stand as I.” Yet they took counsel to restrain Their kindness till they saw the gain; And, since his substance now had run, He rose to do what might be done. He went unto his Love by night, And said: “My Love, I faint in fight: Deserving as thou dost a crown, My cares shall never drag thee down.” (He had descried a maid whose line Would hand her on much corn and wine, And held her far in worth above One who could only pray and love.) But this Fair read him; whence he failed To do the deed so blithely hailed; He saw his projects wholly marred, And gloom and want oppressed him hard; Till, living to so mean an end, Whereby he'd lost his every friend, He perished in the pauper sty Where his old mate lay dying nigh. And moralists, reflecting, said, As “dust to dust” anon was read And echoed from each coffin-lid, “These men were like in all they did.” 1866. LINES Spoken by Miss Ada Rehan at the Lyceum Theatre, July 23, 1890, at a performance on behalf of Lady Jeune's Holiday Fund for City Children. Before we part to alien thoughts and aims, Permit the one brief word the occasion claims: —When mumming and grave motives are allied, Perhaps an Epilogue is justified. Our under-purpose has, in truth, to-day Commanded most our musings; least the play: A purpose futile but for your good-will Swiftly responsive to the cry of ill: A purpose all too limited!—to aid Frail human flowerets, sicklied by the shade, In winning some short spell of upland breeze, Or strengthening sunlight on the level leas. Who has not marked, where the full cheek should be, Incipient lines of lank flaccidity, Lymphatic pallor where the pink should glow, And where the throb of transport, pulses low?— Most tragical of shapes from Pole to Line, O wondering child, unwitting Time's design, Why should Man add to Nature's quandary, And worsen ill by thus immuring thee? —That races do despite unto their own, That Might supernal do indeed condone Wrongs individual for the general ease, Instance the proof in victims such as these. Launched into thoroughfares too thronged before, Mothered by those whose protest is “No more!” Vitalized without option: who shall say That did Life hang on choosing—Yea or Nay— They had not scorned it with such penalty, And nothingness implored of Destiny? And yet behind the horizon smile serene The down, the cornland, and the stretching green— Space—the child's heaven: scenes which at least ensure Some palliative for ill they cannot cure. Dear friends—now moved by this poor show of ours To make your own long joy in buds and bowers For one brief while the joy of infant eyes, Changing their urban murk to paradise— You have our thanks!—may your reward include More than our thanks, far more: their gratitude. Savile Club, Midnight, July 1890. “I LOOK INTO MY GLASS” I look into my glass, And view my wasting skin, And say, “Would God it came to pass My heart had shrunk as thin!” For then, I, undistrest By hearts grown cold to me, Could lonely wait my endless rest With equanimity. But Time, to make me grieve, Part steals, lets part abide; And shakes this fragile frame at eve With throbbings of noontide.</field>

R. 1819–1901 A REVERIE The mightiest moments pass uncalendared, And when the Absolute In backward Time pronounced the deedful word Whereby all life is stirred: “Let one be born and throned whose mould shall constitute The norm of every royal-reckoned attribute,” No mortal knew or heard. But in due days the purposed Life outshone— Serene, sagacious, free; Her waxing seasons bloomed with deeds well done, And the world's heart was won . . .

WAR POEMS EMBARCATION (Southampton Docks: October 1899) Here, where Vespasian's legions struck the sands, And Cerdic with his Saxons entered in, And Henry's army leapt afloat to win Convincing triumphs over neighbour lands, Vaster battalions press for further strands, To argue in the selfsame bloody mode Which this late age of thought, and pact, and code, Still fails to mend.—Now deckward tramp the bands, Yellow as autumn leaves, alive as spring; And as each host draws out upon the sea Beyond which lies the tragical To-be, None dubious of the cause, none murmuring, Wives, sisters, parents, wave white hands and smile, As if they knew not that they weep the while. DEPARTURE (Southampton Docks: October 1899) While the far farewell music thins and fails, And the broad bottoms rip the bearing brine— All smalling slowly to the gray sea-line— And each significant red smoke-shaft pales, Keen sense of severance everywhere prevails, Which shapes the late long tramp of mounting men To seeming words that ask and ask again: “How long, O striving Teutons, Slavs, and Gaels Must your wroth reasonings trade on lives like these, That are as puppets in a playing hand?— When shall the saner softer polities Whereof we dream, have sway in each proud land And patriotism, grown Godlike, scorn to stand Bondslave to realms, but circle earth and seas?” THE COLONEL'S SOLILOQUY (Southampton Docks: October 1899) “The quay recedes. Hurrah! Ahead we go! . . . It's true I've been accustomed now to home, And joints get rusty, and one's limbs may grow More fit to rest than roam. “But I can stand as yet fair stress and strain; There's not a little steel beneath the rust; My years mount somewhat, but here's to't again! And if I fall, I must. “God knows that for myself I have scanty care; Past scrimmages have proved as much to all; In Eastern lands and South I have had my share Both of the blade and ball. “And where those villains ripped me in the flitch With their old iron in my early time, I'm apt at change of wind to feel a twitch, Or at a change of clime. “And what my mirror shows me in the morning Has more of blotch and wrinkle than of bloom; My eyes, too, heretofore all glasses scorning, Have just a touch of rheum. . . . “Now sounds ‘The Girl I've left behind me,’—Ah, The years, the ardours, wakened by that tune! Time was when, with the crowd's farewell ‘Hurrah! 'Twould lift me to the moon. “But now it's late to leave behind me one Who if, poor soul, her man goes underground, Will not recover as she might have done In days when hopes abound. “She's waving from the wharfside, palely grieving, As down we draw. . . . Her tears make little show Yet now she suffers more than at my leaving Some twenty years ago! “I pray those left at home will care for her; I shall come back; I have before; though when The Girl you leave behind you is a grandmother, Things may not be as then.” THE GOING OF THE BATTERY WIVES' LAMENT (November 2, 1899) I O it was sad enough, weak enough, mad enough— Light in their loving as soldiers can be— First to risk choosing them, leave alone losing them Now, in far battle, beyond the South Sea! . . . II —Rain came down drenchingly; but we unblenchingly Trudged on beside them through mirk and through mire, They stepping steadily—only too readily!— Scarce as if stepping brought parting-time nigher. III Great guns were gleaming there, living things seeming there, Cloaked in their tar-cloths, upmouthed to the night; Wheels wet and yellow from axle to felloe, Throats blank of sound, but prophetic to sight. IV Gas-glimmers drearily, blearily, eerily Lit our pale faces outstretched for one kiss, While we stood prest to them, with a last quest to them Not to court perils that honour could miss. V Sharp were those sighs of ours, blinded these eyes of ours, When at last moved away under the arch All we loved. Aid for them each woman prayed for them, Treading back slowly the track of their march. VI Some one said: “Nevermore will they come: evermore Are they now lost to us.” O it was wrong! Though may be hard their ways, some Hand will guard their ways, Bear them through safely, in brief time or long. VII —Yet, voices haunting us, daunting us, taunting us, Hint in the night-time when life beats are low Other and graver things. . . . Hold we to braver things, Wait we, in trust, what Time's fulness shall show. AT THE WAR OFFICE, LONDON Affixing the Lists of Killed and Wounded: December 1899) I Last year I called this world of gaingivings The darkest thinkable, and questioned sadly If my own land could heave its pulse less gladly, So charged it seemed with circumstance that brings The tragedy of things. II Yet at that censured time no heart was rent Or feature blanched of parent, wife, or daughter By hourly posted sheets of scheduled slaughter; Death waited Nature's wont; Peace smiled unshent From Ind to Occident. A CHRISTMAS GHOST-STORY South of the Line, inland from far Durban, A mouldering soldier lies—your countryman. Awry and doubled up are his gray bones, And on the breeze his puzzled phantom moans Nightly to clear Canopus: “I would know By whom and when the All-Earth-gladdening Law Of Peace, brought in by that Man Crucified, Was ruled to be inept, and set aside? And what of logic or of truth appears In tacking ‘Anno Domini’ to the years? Near twenty-hundred liveried thus have hied, But tarries yet the Cause for which He died.” Christmas-eve 1899. DRUMMER HODGE I They throw in Drummer Hodge, to rest Uncoffined—just as found: His landmark is a kopje-crest That breaks the veldt around; And foreign constellations west Each night above his mound. II Young Hodge the Drummer never knew— Fresh from his Wessex home— The meaning of the broad Karoo, The Bush, the dusty loam, And why uprose to nightly view Strange stars amid the gloam. III Yet portion of that unknown plain Will Hodge for ever be; His homely Northern breast and brain Grow to some Southern tree, And strange-eyed constellations reign His stars eternally. A WIFE IN LONDON (December 1899) I She sits in the tawny vapour That the Thames-side lanes have uprolled, Behind whose webby fold on fold Like a waning taper The street-lamp glimmers cold. A messenger's knock cracks smartly, Flashed news is in her hand Of meaning it dazes to understand Though shaped so shortly: He—has fallen—in the far South Land. . . II 'Tis the morrow; the fog hangs thicker, The postman nears and goes: A letter is brought whose lines disclose By the firelight flicker His hand, whom the worm now knows: Fresh—firm—penned in highest feather— Page-full of his hoped return, And of home-planned jaunts by brake and burn In the summer weather, And of new love that they would learn. THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN I The thick lids of Night closed upon me Alone at the Bill Of the Isle by the Race The “Race” is the turbulent sea-area off the Bill of Portland, where contrary tides meet.— Many-caverned, bald, wrinkled of face— And with darkness and silence the spirit was on me To brood and be still. II No wind fanned the flats of the ocean, Or promontory sides, Or the ooze by the strand, Or the bent-bearded slope of the land, Whose base took its rest amid everlong motion Of criss-crossing tides. III Soon from out of the Southward seemed nearing A whirr, as of wings Waved by mighty-vanned flies, Or by night-moths of measureless size, And in softness and smoothness well-nigh beyond hearing Of corporal things. IV And they bore to the bluff, and alighted— A dim-discerned train Of sprites without mould, Frameless souls none might touch or might hold— On the ledge by the turreted lantern, far-sighted By men of the main. V And I heard them say “Home!” and I knew them For souls of the felled On the earth's nether bord Under Capricorn, whither they'd warred, And I neared in my awe, and gave heedfulness to them With breathings inheld. VI Then, it seemed, there approached from the northward A senior soul-flame Of the like filmy hue: And he met them and spake: “Is it you, O my men?” Said they, “Aye! We bear homeward and hearthward To feast on our fame!” VII “I've flown there before you,” he said then: “Your households are well; But—your kin linger less On your glory and war-mightiness Than on dearer things.”—“Dearer?” cried these from the dead then, “Of what do they tell?” VIII “Some mothers muse sadly, and murmur Your doings as boys— Recall the quaint ways Of your babyhood's innocent days. Some pray that, ere dying, your faith had grown firmer, And higher your joys. IX “A father broods: ‘Would I had set him To some humble trade, And so slacked his high fire, And his passionate martial desire; And told him no stories to woo him and whet him To this dire crusade!’” X “And, General, how hold out our sweethearts, Sworn loyal as doves?” —“Many mourn; many think It is not unattractive to prink Them in sables for heroes. Some fickle and fleet hearts Have found them new loves.” XI “And our wives?” quoth another resignedly, “Dwell they on our deeds?” —“Deeds of home; that live yet Fresh as new—deeds of fondness or fret; Ancient words that were kindly expressed or unkindly, These, these have their heeds.” XII —“Alas! then it seems that our glory Weighs less in their thought Than our old homely acts, And the long-ago commonplace facts Of our lives—held by us as scarce part of our story, And rated as nought!” XIII Then bitterly some: “Was it wise now To raise the tomb-door For such knowledge? Away!” But the rest: “Fame we prized till to-day; Yet that hearts keep us green for old kindness we prize now A thousand times more!” XIV Thus speaking, the trooped apparitions Began to disband And resolve them in two: Those whose record was lovely and true Bore to northward for home: those of bitter traditions Again left the land, XV And, towering to seaward in legions, They paused at a spot Overbending the Race— That engulphing, ghast, sinister place— Whither headlong they plunged, to the fathomless regions Of myriads forgot. XVI And the spirits of those who were homing Passed on, rushingly, Like the Pentecost Wind; And the whirr of their wayfaring thinned And surceased on the sky, and but left in the gloaming Sea-mutterings and me. December 1899. SONG OF THE SOLDIERS' WIVES AND SWEETHEARTS I At last! In sight of home again, Of home again; No more to range and roam again As at that bygone time? No more to go away from us And stay from us?— Dawn, hold not long the day from us, But quicken it to prime! II Now all the town shall ring to them, Shall ring to them, And we who love them cling to them And clasp them joyfully; And cry, “O much we'll do for you Anew for you, Dear Loves!—aye, draw and hew for you, Come back from oversea.” III Some told us we should meet no more, Yea, meet no more!— Should wait, and wish, but greet no more Your faces round our fires; That, in a while, uncharily And drearily Men gave their lives—even wearily, Like those whom living tires. IV And now you are nearing home again, Dears, home again; No more, may be, to roam again As at that bygone time, Which took you far away from us To stay from us; Dawn, hold not long the day from us, But quicken it to prime! THE SICK BATTLE-GOD I In days when men found joy in war, A God of Battles sped each mortal jar; The peoples pledged him heart and hand, From Israel's land to isles afar. II His crimson form, with clang and chime, Flashed on each murk and murderous meeting-time, And kings invoked, for rape and raid, His fearsome aid in rune and rhyme. III On bruise and blood-hole, scar and seam, On blade and bolt, he flung his fulgid beam: His haloes rayed the very gore, And corpses wore his glory-gleam. IV Often an early King or Queen, And storied hero onward, caught his sheen; 'Twas glimpsed by Wolfe, by Ney anon, And Nelson on his blue demesne. V But new light spread. That god's gold nimb And blazon have waned dimmer and more dim; Even his flushed form begins to fade, Till but a shade is left of him. VI That modern meditation broke His spell, that penmen's pleadings dealt a stroke, Say some; and some that crimes too dire Did much to mire his crimson cloak. VII Yea, seeds of crescent sympathy Were sown by those more excellent than he, Long known, though long contemned till then— The gods of men in amity. VIII Souls have grown seers, and thought outbrings The mournful many-sidedness of things With foes as friends, enfeebling ires And fury-fires by gaingivings! IX He rarely gladdens champions now; They do and dare, but tensely—pale of brow; And would they fain uplift the arm Of that weak form they know not how. X Yet wars arise, though zest grows cold; Wherefore, at times, as if in ancient mould He looms, bepatched with paint and lath; But never hath he seemed the old! XI Let men rejoice, let men deplore, The lurid Deity of heretofore Succumbs to one of saner nod; The Battle-god is god no more. POEMS OF PILGRIMAGE GENOA AND THE MEDITERRANEAN (March 1887) O epic-famed, god-haunted Central Sea, Heave careless of the deep wrong done to thee When from Torino's track I saw thy face first flash on me. And multimarbled Genova the Proud, Gleam all unconscious how, wide-lipped, up-browed, I first beheld thee clad—not as the Beauty but the Dowd. Out from a deep-delved way my vision lit On housebacks pink, green, ochreous—where a slit Shoreward 'twixt row and row revealed the classic blue through it. And thereacross waved fishwives' high-hung smocks, Chrome kerchiefs, scarlet hose, darned underfrocks; Often since when my dreams of thee, O Queen, that frippery mocks: Whereat I grieve, Superba! . . . Afterhours Within Palazzo Doria's orange bowers Went far to mend these marrings of thy soul-subliming powers. But, Queen, such squalid undress none should see, Those dream-endangering eyewounds no more be Where lovers first behold thy form in pilgrimage to thee. SHELLEY'S SKYLARK (The neighbourhood of Leghorn: March 1887) Somewhere afield here something lies In Earth's oblivious eyeless trust That moved a poet to prophecies— A pinch of unseen, unguarded dust: The dust of the lark that Shelley heard, And made immortal through times to be;— Though it only lived like another bird, And knew not its immortality: Lived its meek life; then, one day, fell— A little ball of feather and bone; And how it perished, when piped farewell, And where it wastes, are alike unknown. Maybe it rests in the loam I view, Maybe it throbs in a myrtle's green, Maybe it sleeps in the coming hue Of a grape on the slopes of yon inland scene. Go find it, faeries, go and find That tiny pinch of priceless dust, And bring a casket silver-lined, And framed of gold that gems encrust; And we will lay it safe therein, And consecrate it to endless time; For it inspired a bard to win Ecstatic heights in thought and rhyme. IN THE OLD THEATRE, FIESOLE (April 1887) I traced the Circus whose gray stones incline Where Rome and dim Etruria interjoin, Till came a child who showed an ancient coin That bore the image of a Constantine. She lightly passed; nor did she once opine How, better than all books, she had raised for me In swift perspective Europe's history Through the vast years of Cæsar's sceptred line. For in my distant plot of English loam 'Twas but to delve, and straightway there to find Coins of like impress. As with one half blind Whom common simples cure, her act flashed home In that mute moment to my opened mind The power, the pride, the reach of perished Rome. ROME: ON THE PALATINE (April 1887) We walked where Victor Jove was shrined awhile, And passed to Livia's rich red mural show, Whence, thridding cave and Criptoportico, We gained Caligula's dissolving pile. And each ranked ruin tended to beguile The outer sense, and shape itself as though It wore its marble gleams, its pristine glow Of scenic frieze and pompous peristyle. When lo, swift hands, on strings nigh overhead, Began to melodize a waltz by Strauss: It stirred me as I stood, in Cæsar's house, Raised the old routs Imperial lyres had led, And blended pulsing life with lives long done, Till Time seemed fiction, Past and Present one. ROME: BUILDING A NEW STREET IN THE ANCIENT QUARTER (April 1887) These umbered cliffs and gnarls of masonry Outskeleton Time's central city, Rome; Whereof each arch, entablature, and dome Lies bare in all its gaunt anatomy. And cracking frieze and rotten metope Express, as though they were an open tome Top-lined with caustic monitory gnome; “Dunces, Learn here to spell Humanity!” And yet within these ruins' very shade The singing workmen shape and set and join Their frail new mansion's stuccoed cove and quoin With no apparent sense that years abrade, Though each rent wall their feeble works invade Once shamed all such in power of pier and groin. ROME: THE VATICAN: SALA DELLE MUSE (1887) I sat in the Muses' Hall at the mid of the day, And it seemed to grow still, and the people to pass away, And the chiselled shapes to combine in a haze of sun, Till beside a Carrara column there gleamed forth One. She looked not this nor that of those beings divine, But each and the whole—an essence of all the Nine; With tentative foot she neared to my halting-place, A pensive smile on her sweet, small, marvellous face. “Regarded so long, we render thee sad?” said she. “Not you,” sighed I, “but my own inconstancy! I worship each and each; in the morning one, And then, alas! another at sink of sun. “To-day my soul clasps Form; but where is my troth Of yesternight with Tune: can one cleave to both?” —“Be not perturbed,” said she. “Though apart in fame, As I and my sisters are one, those, too, are the same.” —“But my love goes further—to Story, and Dance, and Hymn, The lover of all in a sun-sweep is fool to whim— Is swayed like a river-weed as the ripples run!” —“Nay, wooer, thou sway'st not. These are but phases of one; “And that one is I; and I am projected from thee, One that out of thy brain and heart thou causest to be— Extern to thee nothing. Grieve not, nor thyself becall, Woo where thou wilt; and rejoice thou canst love at all!” ROME: AT THE PYRAMID OF CESTIUS NEAR THE GRAVES OF SHELLEY AND KEATS (1887) Who, then, was Cestius, And what is he to me?— Amid thick thoughts and memories multitudinous One thought alone brings he. I can recall no word Of anything he did; For me he is a man who died and was interred To leave a pyramid Whose purpose was exprest Not with its first design, Nor till, far down in Time, beside it found their rest Two countrymen of mine. Cestius in life, maybe, Slew, breathed out threatening; I know not. This I know: in death all silently He does a finer thing, In beckoning pilgrim feet With marble finger high To where, by shadowy wall and history-haunted street, Those matchless singers lie. . . . —Say, then, he lived and died That stones which bear his name Should mark, through Time, where two immortal Shades abide; It is an ample fame. LAUSANNE: IN GIBBON'S OLD GARDEN: 11–12 P. M. June 27, 1897 (The 110th anniversary of the completion of the “Decline and Fall” at the same hour and place) A spirit seems to pass, Formal in pose, but grave withal and grand: He contemplates a volume in his hand, And far lamps fleck him through the thin acacias. Anon the book is closed, With “It is finished!” And at the alley's end He turns, and when on me his glances bend As from the Past comes speech—small, muted, yet composed. “How fares the Truth now?—Ill? —Do pens but slily further her advance? May one not speed her but in phrase askance? Do scribes aver the Comic to be Reverend still? “Still rule those minds on earth At whom sage Milton's wormwood words were hurled: ‘Truth like a bastard comes into the world Never without ill-fame to him who gives her birth’?” ZERMATT TO THE MATTERHORN (June–July 1897) Thirty-two years since, up against the sun, Seven shapes, thin atomies to lower sight, Labouringly leapt and gained thy gabled height, And four lives paid for what the seven had won. They were the first by whom the deed was done, And when I look at thee, my mind takes flight To that day's tragic feat of manly might, As though, till then, of history thou hadst none. Yet ages ere men topped thee, late and soon Thou didst behold the planets lift and lower; Saw'st, maybe, Joshua's pausing sun and moon, And the betokening sky when Cæsar's power Approached its bloody end; yea, even that Noon When darkness filled the earth till the ninth hour THE BRIDGE OF LODI Pronounce “Loddy.’ (Spring 1887) I When of tender mind and body, I was moved by minstrelsy, And that air “The Bridge of Lodi” Brought a strange delight to me. II In the battle-breathing jingle Of its forward-footing tune I could see the armies mingle, And the columns crushed and hewn III On that far-famed spot by Lodi Where Napoleon clove his way To his fame, when like a god he Bent the nations to his sway. IV Hence the tune came capering to me While I traced the Rhone and Po; Nor could Milan's Marvel woo me From the spot englamoured so. V And to-day, sunlit and smiling, Here I stand upon the scene, With its saffron walls, dun tiling, And its meads of maiden green, VI Even as when the trackway thundered With the charge of grenadiers, And the blood of forty hundred Splashed its parapets and piers. . . VII Any ancient crone I'd toady Like a lass in young-eyed prime, Could she tell some tale of Lodi At that moving mighty time. VIII So, I ask the wives of Lodi For traditions of that day; But, alas! not anybody Seems to know of such a fray. IX And they heed but transitory Marketings in cheese and meat, Till I judge that Lodi's story Is extinct in Lodi's street. X Yet while here and there they thrid them In their zest to sell and buy, Let me sit me down amid them And behold those thousands die. . . XI —Not a creature cares in Lodi How Napoleon swept each arch, Or where up and downward trod he, Or for his outmatching march! XII So that wherefore should I be here, Watching Adda lip the lea, When the whole romance to see here Is the dream I bring with me? XIII And why sing “The Bridge of Lodi” As I sit thereon and swing, When none shows by smile or nod he Guesses why or what I sing?. . . XIV Since all Lodi, low and head ones, Seem to pass that story by, It may be the Lodi-bred ones Rate it truly, and not I. XV Once engrossing Bridge of Lodi, Is thy claim to glory gone? Must I pipe a palinody, Or be silent thereupon? XVI And if here, from strand to steeple, Be no stone to fame the fight, Must I say the Lodi people Are but viewing war aright? . . XVII Nay; I'll sing “The Bridge of Lodi”— That long-loved, romantic thing, Though none show by smile or nod he Guesses why and what I sing! ON AN INVITATION TO THE UNITED STATES I My ardours for emprize nigh lost Since Life has bared its bones to me, I shrink to seek a modern coast Whose riper times have yet to be; Where the new regions claim them free From that long drip of human tears Which peoples old in tragedy Have left upon the centuried years. II For, wonning in these ancient lands, Enchased and lettered as a tomb, And scored with prints of perished hands, And chronicled with dates of doom, Though my own Being bear no bloom I trace the lives such scenes enshrine, Give past exemplars present room, And their experience count as mine. MISCELLANEOUS POEMS THE MOTHER MOURNS When mid-autumn's moan shook the night-time, And sedges were horny, And summer's green wonderwork faltered On leaze and in lane, I fared Yell'ham-Firs way, where dimly Came wheeling around me Those phantoms obscure and insistent That shadows unchain. Till airs from the needle-thicks brought me A low lamentation, As though from a tree-god disheartened, Perplexed, or in pain. And, heeding, it awed me to gather That Nature herself there Was breathing in aëry accents, With dirge-like refrain, Weary plaint that Mankind, in these late days, Had grieved her by holding Her ancient high fame of perfection In doubt and disdain. . . . —“I had not proposed me a Creature (She soughed) so excelling All else of my kingdom in compass And brightness of brain “As to read my defects with a god-glance, Uncover each vestige Of old inadvertence, annunciate Each flaw and each stain! “My purpose went not to develop Such insight in Earthland; Such potent appraisements affront me, And sadden my reign! “Why loosened I olden control here To mechanize skywards, Undeeming great scope could outshape in A globe of such grain? “Man's mountings of mindsight I checked not, Till range of his vision Now tops my intent, and finds blemish Throughout my domain. “He holds as inept his own soul-shell— My deftest achievement— Contemns me for fitful inventions Ill-timed and inane: “No more sees my sun as a Sanct-shape, My moon as the Night-queen, My stars as august and sublime ones That influences rain: “Reckons gross and ignoble my teaching, Immoral my story, My love-lights a lure that my species May gather and gain. “‘Give me,’ he has said, ‘but the matter And means the gods lot her, My brain could evolve a creation More seemly, more sane.’ —“If ever a naughtiness seized me To woo adulation From creatures more keen than those crude ones That first formed my train— “If inly a moment I murmured, ‘The simple praise sweetly, But sweetlier the sage’—and did rashly Man's vision unrein, “I rue it! . . . His guileless forerunners, Whose brains I could blandish, To measure the deeps of my mysteries Applied them in vain. “From them my waste aimings and futile I subtly could cover; ‘Every best thing,’ said they, ‘to best purpose Her powers preordain.’— “No more such! . . . My species are dwindling, My forests grow barren, My popinjays fail from their tappings, My larks from their strain. “My leopardine beauties are rarer, My tusky ones vanish, My children have aped mine own slaughters To quicken my wane. “Let me grow, then, but mildews and mandrakes, And slimy distortions, Let nevermore things good and lovely To me appertain; “For Reason is rank in my temples, And Vision unruly, And chivalrous laud of my cunning Is heard not again!” “I SAID TO LOVE” I said to Love, “It is not now as in old days When men adored thee and thy ways All else above; Named thee the Boy, the Bright, the One Who spread a heaven beneath the sun,” I said to Love. I said to him, “We now know more of thee than then; We were but weak in judgment when, With hearts abrim, We clamoured thee that thou would'st please Inflict on us thine agonies,” I said to him. I said to Love, “Thou art not young, thou art not fair, No elfin darts, no cherub air, Nor swan, nor dove Are thine; but features pitiless, And iron daggers of distress,” I said to Love. “Depart then, Love! . . . —Man's race shall perish, threatenest thou, Without thy kindling coupling-vow? The age to come the man of now Know nothing of?— We fear not such a threat from thee; We are too old in apathy! Mankind shall cease.—So let it be,” I said to Love. A COMMONPLACE DAY The day is turning ghost, And scuttles from the kalendar in fits and furtively, To join the anonymous host Of those that throng oblivion; ceding his place, maybe, To one of like degree. I part the fire-gnawed logs, Rake forth the embers, spoil the busy flames, and lay the ends Upon the shining dogs; Further and further from the nooks the twilight's stride extends, And beamless black impends. Nothing of tiniest worth Have I wrought, pondered, planned; no one thing asking blame or praise, Since the pale corpse-like birth Of this diurnal unit, bearing blanks in all its rays— Dullest of dull-hued Days! Wanly upon the panes The rain slides, as have slid since morn my colourless thoughts; and yet Here, while Day's presence wanes, And over him the sepulchre-lid is slowly lowered and set, He wakens my regret. Regret—though nothing dear That I wot of, was toward in the wide world at his prime, Or bloomed elsewhere than here, To die with his decease, and leave a memory sweet, sublime, Or mark him out in Time. . . . —Yet, maybe, in some soul, In some spot undiscerned on sea or land, some impulse rose, Or some intent upstole Of that enkindling ardency from whose maturer glows The world's amendment flows; But which, benumbed at birth By momentary chance or wile, has missed its hope to be Embodied on the earth; And undervoicings of this loss to man's futurity May wake regret in me. AT A LUNAR ECLIPSE Thy shadow, Earth, from Pole to Central Sea, Now steals along upon the Moon's meek shine In even monochrome and curving line Of imperturbable serenity. How shall I link such sun-cast symmetry With the torn troubled form I know as thine, That profile, placid as a brow divine, With continents of moil and misery? And can immense Mortality but throw So small a shade, and Heaven's high human scheme Be hemmed within the coasts yon arc implies? Is such the stellar gauge of earthly show, Nation at war with nation, brains that teem, Heroes, and women fairer than the skies? THE LACKING SENSE Scene.—A sad-coloured landscape, Waddon Vale I “O time, whence comes the Mother's moody look amid her labours, As of one who all unwittingly has wounded where she loves? Why weaves she not her world-webs to according lutes and tabors, With nevermore this too remorseful air upon her face, As of angel fallen from grace?” II —“Her look is but her story: construe not its symbols keenly: In her wonderworks yea surely has she wounded where she loves. The sense of ills misdealt for blisses blanks the mien most queenly, Self-smitings kill self-joys; and everywhere beneath the sun Such deeds her hands have done.” III —“And how explains thy Ancient Mind her crimes upon her creatures, These fallings from her fair beginnings, woundings where she loves, Into her would-be perfect motions, modes, effects, and features Admitting cramps, black humours, wan decay, and baleful blights, Distress into delights?” IV —“Ah! knowest thou not her secret yet, her vainly veiled deficience, Whence it comes that all unwittingly she wounds the lives she loves? That sightless are those orbs of hers?—which bar to her omniscience Brings those fearful unfulfilments, that red ravage through her zones Whereat all creation groans. V “She whispers it in each pathetic strenuous slow endeavour, When in mothering she unwittingly sets wounds on what she loves; Yet her primal doom pursues her, faultful, fatal is she ever; Though so deft and nigh to vision is her facile finger-touch That the seers marvel much. VI “Deal, then, her groping skill no scorn, no note of malediction; Not long on thee will press the hand that hurts the lives it loves; And while she plods dead-reckoning on, in darkness of affliction, Assist her where thy creaturely dependence can or may, For thou art of her clay.” TO LIFE O Life with the sad seared face, I weary of seeing thee, And thy draggled cloak, and thy hobbling pace, And thy too-forced pleasantry! I know what thou would'st tell Of Death, Time, Destiny— I have known it long, and know, too, well What it all means for me. But canst thou not array Thyself in rare disguise, And feign like truth, for one mad day, That Earth is Paradise? I'll tune me to the mood, And mumm with thee till eve; And maybe what as interlude I feign, I shall believe! DOOM AND SHE I There dwells a mighty pair— Slow, statuesque, intense— Amid the vague Immense: None can their chronicle declare, Nor why they be, nor whence. II Mother of all things made, Matchless in artistry, Unlit with sight is she.— And though her ever well-obeyed Vacant of feeling he. III The Matron mildly asks— A throb in every word— “Our clay-made creatures, lord. How fare they in their mortal tasks Upon Earth's bounded bord? IV “The fate of those I bear, Dear lord, pray turn and view. And notify me true; Shapings that eyelessly I dare Maybe I would undo. V “Sometimes from lairs of life Methinks I catch a groan, Or multitudinous moan, As though I had schemed a world of strife, Working by touch alone.” VI “World-weaver!” he replies, “I scan all thy domain; But since nor joy nor pain It lies in me to recognize, Thy questionings are vain. VII “World-weaver! what is Grief? And what are Right, and Wrong, And Feeling, that belong To creatures all who owe thee fief? Why is Weak worse than Strong?” . . . VIII —Unanswered, curious, meek, She broods in sad surmise. . . . —Some say they have heard her sighs On Alpine height or Polar peak When the night tempests rise. THE PROBLEM Shall we conceal the Case, or tell it— We who believe the evidence? Here and there the watch-towers knell it With a sullen significance, Heard of the few who hearken intently and carry an eagerly upstrained sense. Hearts that are happiest hold not by it; Better we let, then, the old view reign: Since there is peace in that, why decry it? Since there is comfort, why disdain? Note not the pigment so long as the painting determines humanity's joy and pain. THE SUBALTERNS I “Poor wanderer,” said the leaden sky, “I fain would lighten thee, But there are laws in force on high Which say it must not be.” II —“I would not freeze thee, shorn one,” cried The North, “knew I but how To warm my breath, to slack my stride; But I am ruled as thou.” III —“To-morrow I attack thee, wight,” Said Sickness. “Yet I swear I bear thy little ark no spite, But am bid enter there.” IV —“Come hither, Son,” I heard Death say; “I did not will a grave Should end thy pilgrimage to-day, But I, too, am a slave!” V We smiled upon each other then, And life to me had less Of that fell look it wore ere when They owned their passiveness. THE SLEEP-WORKER When wilt thou wake, O Mother, wake and see— As one who, held in trance, has laboured long By vacant rote and prepossession strong— The coils that thou hast wrought unwittingly; Wherein have place, unrealized by thee, Fair growths, foul cankers, right enmeshed with wrong, Strange orchestras of victim-shriek and song, And curious blends of ache and ecstasy?— Should that morn come, and show thy opened eyes All that Life's palpitating tissues feel, How wilt thou bear thyself in thy surprise?— Wilt thou destroy, in one wild shock of shame, Thy whole high heaving firmamental frame, Or patiently adjust, amend, and heal? THE BULLFINCHES Brother Bulleys, let us sing From the dawn till evening!— For we know not that we go not When to-day's pale pinions fold Where they be that sang of old. When I flew to Blackmoor Vale, Whence the green-gowned faeries hail, Roosting near them I could hear them Speak of queenly Nature's ways, Means, and moods,—well known to fays. All we creatures, nigh and far (Said they there), the Mother's are; Yet she never shows endeavour To protect from warrings wild Bird or beast she calls her child. Busy in her handsome house Known as Space, she falls a-drowse; Yet, in seeming, works on dreaming, While beneath her groping hands Fiends make havoc in her bands. How her hussif'ry succeeds She unknows or she unheeds, All things making for Death's taking! —So the green-gowned faeries say Living over Blackmoor way. Come then, brethren, let us sing, From the dawn till evening!— For we know not that we go not When the day's pale pinions fold Where those be that sang of old. GOD-FORGOTTEN I towered far, and lo! I stood within The presence of the Lord Most High, Sent thither by the sons of Earth, to win Some answer to their cry. —“The Earth, sayest thou? The Human race? By Me created? Sad its lot? Nay: I have no remembrance of such place: Such world I fashioned not.”— —“O Lord, forgive me when I say Thou spakest the word that made it all.”— “The Earth of men—let me bethink me. . . . Yea! I dimly do recall “Some tiny sphere I built long back (Mid millions of such shapes of mine) So named . . . It perished, surely—not a wrack Remaining, or a sign? “It lost my interest from the first, My aims therefor succeeding ill; Haply it died of doing as it durst?”— “Lord, it existeth still.”— “Dark, then, its life! For not a cry Of aught it bears do I now hear; Of its own act the threads were snapt whereby Its plaints had reached mine ear. “It used to ask for gifts of good, Till came its severance, self-entailed, When sudden silence on that side ensued, And has till now prevailed. “All other orbs have kept in touch; Their voicings reach me speedily: Thy people took upon them overmuch In sundering them from me! “And it is strange—though sad enough— Earth's race should think that one whose call Frames, daily, shining spheres of flawless stuff Must heed their tainted ball! . . . “But sayest it is by pangs distraught, And strife, and silent suffering?— Sore grieved am I that injury should be wrought Even on so poor a thing! “Thou shouldst have learnt that Not to Mend For Me could mean but Not to Know: Hence, Messengers! and straightway put an end To what men undergo.” . . Homing at dawn, I thought to see One of the Messengers standing by. —Oh, childish thought! . . . Yet often it comes to me When trouble hovers nigh. THE BEDRIDDEN PEASANT TO AN UNKNOWING GOD Much wonder I—here long low-laid— That this dead wall should be Betwixt the Maker and the made, Between Thyself and me! For, say one puts a child to nurse, He eyes it now and then To know if better it is, or worse, And if it mourn, and when, But Thou, Lord, giv'st us men our day In helpless bondage thus To Time and Chance, and seem'st straightway To think no more of us! That some disaster cleft Thy scheme And tore us wide apart, So that no cry can cross, I deem; For Thou art mild of heart, And wouldst not shape and shut us in Where voice can not be heard: Plainly Thou meant'st that we should win Thy succour by a word. Might but Thy sense flash down the skies Like man's from clime to clime, Thou wouldst not let me agonize Through my remaining time; But, seeing how much Thy creatures bear— Lame, starved, or maimed, or blind— Wouldst heal the ills with quickest care Of me and all my kind. Then, since Thou mak'st not these things be, But these things dost not know, I'll praise Thee as were shown to me The mercies Thou wouldst show! BY THE EARTH'S CORPSE I “O Lord, why grievest Thou?— Since Life has ceased to be Upon this globe, now cold As lunar land and sea, And humankind, and fowl, and fur Are gone eternally, All is the same to Thee as ere They knew mortality.” II “O Time,” replied the Lord, “Thou readest me ill, I ween; Were all the same, I should not grieve At that late earthly scene, Now blestly past—though planned by me With interest close and keen!— Nay, nay: things now are not the same As they have earlier been. III “Written indelibly On my eternal mind Are all the wrongs endured By Earth's poor patient kind, Which my too oft unconscious hand Let enter undesigned. No god can cancel deeds foredone, Or thy old coils unwind! IV “As when, in Noë's days, I whelmed the plains with sea, So at this last, when flesh And herb but fossils be, And, all extinct, their piteous dust Revolves obliviously, That I made Earth, and life, and man, It still repenteth me!” MUTE OPINION I I traversed a dominion Whose spokesmen spake out strong Their purpose and opinion Through pulpit, press, and song. I scarce had means to note there A large-eyed few, and dumb, Who thought not as those thought there That stirred the heat and hum. II When, grown a Shade, beholding That land in lifetime trode, To learn if its unfolding Fulfilled its clamoured code, I saw, in web unbroken, Its history outwrought Not as the loud had spoken, But as the mute had thought. TO AN UNBORN PAUPER CHILD I Breathe not, hid Heart: cease silently, And though thy birth-hour beckons thee, Sleep the long sleep: The Doomsters heap Travails and teens around us here, And Time-wraiths turn our songsingings to fear. II Hark, how the peoples surge and sigh, And laughters fail, and greetings die: Hopes dwindle; yea, Faiths waste away, Affections and enthusiasms numb; Thou canst not mend these things if thou dost come. III Had I the ear of wombèd souls Ere their terrestrial chart unrolls, And thou wert free To cease, or be, Then would I tell thee all I know, And put it to thee: Wilt thou take Life so? IV Vain vow! No hint of mine may hence To theeward fly: to thy locked sense Explain none can Life's pending plan: Thou wilt thy ignorant entry make Though skies spout fire and blood and nations quake. V Fain would I, dear, find some shut plot Of earth's wide wold for thee, where not One tear, one qualm, Should break the calm. But I am weak as thou and bare; No man can change the common lot to rare. VI Must come and bide. And such are we— Unreasoning, sanguine, visionary— That I can hope Health, love, friends, scope In full for thee; can dream thou'lt find Joys seldom yet attained by humankind! TO FLOWERS FROM ITALY IN WINTER Sunned in the South, and here to-day; —If all organic things Be sentient, Flowers, as some men say, What are your ponderings? How can you stay, nor vanish quite From this bleak spot of thorn, And birch, and fir, and frozen white Expanse of the forlorn? Frail luckless exiles hither brought! Your dust will not regain Old sunny haunts of Classic thought When you shall waste and wane; But mix with alien earth, be lit With frigid Boreal flame, And not a sign remain in it To tell man whence you came. ON A FINE MORNING I Whence comes Solace?—Not from seeing What is doing, suffering, being, Not from noting Life's conditions, Nor from heeding Time's monitions; But in cleaving to the Dream, And in gazing at the gleam Whereby gray things golden seem. II Thus do I this heyday, holding Shadows but as lights unfolding, As no specious show this moment With its iris-hued embowment; But as nothing other than Part of a benignant plan; Proof that earth was made for man. February 1899. TO LIZBIE BROWNE I Dear Lizbie Browne, Where are you now? In sun, in rain?— Or is your brow Past joy, past pain, Dear Lizbie Browne? II Sweet Lizbie Browne, How you could smile, How you could sing!— How archly wile In glance-giving, Sweet Lizbie Browne! III And, Lizbie Browne, Who else had hair Bay-red as yours, Or flesh so fair Bred out of doors, Sweet Lizbie Browne? IV When, Lizbie Browne, You had just begun To be endeared By stealth to one, You disappeared My Lizbie Browne! V Ay, Lizbie Browne, So swift your life, And mine so slow, You were a wife Ere I could show Love, Lizbie Browne. VI Still, Lizbie Browne, You won, they said, The best of men When you were wed. . . Where went you then, O Lizbie Browne? VII Dear Lizbie Browne, I should have thought, “Girls ripen fast,” And coaxed and caught You ere you passed, Dear Lizbie Browne! VIII But, Lizbie Browne, I let you slip; Shaped not a sign; Touched never your lip With lip of mine, Lost Lizbie Browne! IX So, Lizbie Browne, When on a day Men speak of me As not, you'll say, “And who was he?”— Yes, Lizbie Browne! SONG OF HOPE O sweet To-morrow!— After to-day There will away This sense of sorrow. Then let us borrow Hope, for a gleaming Soon will be streaming, Dimmed by no gray— No gray! While the winds wing us Sighs from The Gone, Nearer to dawn Minute-beats bring us; When there will sing us Larks, of a glory Waiting our story Further anon— Anon! Doff the black token, Don the red shoon, Right and retune Viol-strings broken: Null the words spoken In speeches of rueing, The night cloud is hueing, To-morrow shines soon— Shines soon! THE WELL-BELOVED I went by star and planet shine Towards the dear one's home At Kingsbere, there to make her mine When the next sun upclomb. I edged the ancient hill and wood Beside the Ikling Way, Nigh where the Pagan temple stood In the world's earlier day. And as I quick and quicker walked On gravel and on green, I sang to sky, and tree, or talked Of her I called my queen. —“O faultless is her dainty form, And luminous her mind; She is the God-created norm Of perfect womankind!” A shape whereon one star-blink gleamed Slid softly by my side, A woman's; and her motion seemed The motion of my bride. And yet methought she'd drawn erstwhile Out from the ancient leaze, Where once were pile and peristyle For men's idolatries. —“O maiden lithe and lone, what may Thy name and lineage be Who so resemblest by this ray My darling?—Art thou she?” The Shape: “Thy bride remains within Her father's grange and grove” —“Thou speakest rightly,” I broke in, “Thou art not she I love.” —“Nay: though thy bride remains inside Her father's walls,” said she, “The one most dear is with thee here, For thou dost love but me.” Then I: “But she, my only choice, Is now at Kingsbere Grove?” Again her soft mysterious voice “I am thy only Love.” Thus still she vouched, and still I said, “O sprite, that cannot be!” . . . It was as if my bosom bled, So much she troubled me. The sprite resumed: “Thou hast transferred To her dull form awhile My beauty, fame, and deed, and word, My gestures and my smile. “O fatuous man, this truth infer, Brides are not what they seem; Thou lovest what thou dreamest her; I am thy very dream!” —“O then,” I answered miserably, Speaking as scarce I knew, “My loved one, I must wed with thee If what thou sayest be true!” She, proudly, thinning in the gloom: “Though, since troth-plight began, I have ever stood as bride to groom, I wed no mortal man!” Thereat she vanished by the lane Adjoining Kingsbere town, Near where, men say, once stood the Fane To Venus, on the Down. —When I arrived and met my bride Her look was pinched and thin, As if her soul had shrunk and died, And left a waste within. HER REPROACH Con the dead page as 'twere live love: press on! Cold wisdom's words will ease thy track for thee; Aye, go; cast off sweet ways, and leave me wan To biting blasts that are intent on me. But if thy object Fame's far summits be, Whose inclines many a skeleton overlies That missed both dream and substance, stop and see How absence wears these cheeks and dims these eyes! It surely is far sweeter and more wise To water love, than toil to leave anon A name whose glory-gleam will but advise Invidious minds to eclipse it with their own, And over which the kindliest will but stay A moment; musing, “He, too, had his day!” Westbourne Park Villas, 1867. THE INCONSISTENT I say, “She was as good as fair!” When standing by her mound; “Such passing sweetness,” I declare, “No longer treads the ground.” I say, “What living Love can catch Her bloom and bonhomie, And what in recent maidens match Her olden warmth to me!” —There stands within yon vestry-nook Where bonded lovers sign, Her name upon a faded book With one that is not mine. To him she breathed the tender vow She once had breathed to me, But yet I say, “O Love, even now Would I had died for thee!” A BROKEN APPOINTMENT You did not come, And marching Time drew on, and wore me numb.— Yet less for loss of your dear presence there Than that I thus found lacking in your make That high compassion which can overbear Reluctance for pure lovingkindness' sake Grieved I, when, as the hope-hour stroked its sum, You did not come. You love not me, And love alone can lend you loyalty; —I know and knew it. But, unto the store Of human deeds divine in all but name, Was it not worth a little hour or more To add yet this: Once you, a woman, came To soothe a time-torn man; even thought it be You love not me? “BETWEEN US NOW” Between us now and here— Two thrown together Who are not wont to wear Life's flushest feather— Who see the scenes slide past, The daytimes dimming fast, Let there be truth at last, Even if despair. So thoroughly and long Have you now known me, So real in faith and strong Have I now shown me, That nothing needs disguise Further in any wise, Or asks or justifies A guarded tongue. Face unto face, then, say, Eyes my own meeting, Is your heart far away, Or with mine beating? When false things are brought low, And swift things have grown slow, Feigning like froth shall go, Faith be for aye. “HOW GREAT MY GRIEF” (TRIOLET) How great my grief, my joys how few, Since first it was my fate to know thee! —Have the slow years not brought to view How great my grief, my joys how few, Nor memory shaped old times anew, Nor loving-kindness helped to show thee How great my grief, my joys how few, Since first it was my fate to know thee? “I NEED NOT GO” I need not go Through sleet and snow To where I know She waits for me; She will tarry me there Till I find it fair, And have time to spare From company. When I've overgot The world somewhat, When things cost not Such stress and strain, Is soon enough By cypress sough To tell my Love I am come again. And if some day, When none cries nay, I still delay To seek her side, (Though ample measure Of fitting leisure Await my pleasure) She will not chide. What—not upbraid me That I delayed me, Nor ask what stayed me So long? Ah, no!— New cares may claim me, New loves inflame me, She will not blame me, But suffer it so. THE COQUETTE, AND AFTER (TRIOLETS) I For long the cruel wish I knew That your free heart should ache for me While mine should bear no ache for you; For long—the cruel wish!—I knew How men can feel, and craved to view My triumph—fated not to be For long! . . . The cruel wish I knew That your free heart should ache for me! II At last one pays the penalty— The woman—women always do. My farce, I found, was tragedy At last!—One pays the penalty With interest when one, fancy-free, Learns love, learns shame. . . . Of sinners two At last one pays the penalty— The woman—women always do! A SPOT In years defaced and lost, Two sat here, transport-tossed, Lit by a living love The wilted world knew nothing of: Scared momently By gaingivings, Then hoping things That could not be. . . . Of love and us no trace Abides upon the place; The sun and shadows wheel, Season and season sereward steal; Foul days and fair Here, too, prevail, And gust and gale As everywhere. But lonely shepherd souls Who bask amid these knolls May catch a faery sound On sleepy noontides from the ground: “O not again Till Earth outwears Shall love like theirs Suffuse this glen!” LONG PLIGHTED Is it worth while, dear, now, To call for bells, and sally forth arrayed For marriage-rites—discussed, descried, delayed So many years? Is it worth while, dear, now, To stir desire for old fond purposings, By feints that Time still serves for dallyings, Though quittance nears? Is it worth while, dear, when The day being so far spent, so low the sun, The undone thing will soon be as the done, And smiles as tears? Is it worth while, dear, when Our cheeks are worn, our early brown is gray; When, meet or part we, none says yea or nay, Or heeds, or cares? Is it worth while, dear, since We still can climb old Yell'ham's wooded mounds Together, as each season steals its rounds And disappears? Is it worth while, dear, since As mates in Mellstock churchyard we can lie, Till the last crash of all things low and high Shall end the spheres? THE WIDOW BETROTHED I passed the lodge and avenue To her fair tenement, And sunset on her window-panes Reflected our intent. The creeper on the gable nigh Was fired to more than red, And when I came to halt thereby “Bright as my joy!” I said. Of late days it had been her aim To meet me in the hall; Now at my footsteps no one came, And no one to my call. Again I knocked, and tardily An inner tread was heard, And I was shown her presence then With a mere answering word. She met me, and but barely took My proffered warm embrace; Preoccupation weighed her look, And hardened her sweet face. “To-morrow—could you—would you call? Abridge your present stay? My child is ill—my one, my all!— And can't be left to-day.” And then she turns, and gives commands As I were out of sound, Or were no more to her and hers Than any neighbour round. . . . —As maid I loved her; but one came And pleased, and coaxed, and wooed. And when in time he wedded her I deemed her gone for good. He won, I lost her; and my loss I bore I know not how; But I do think I suffered then Less wretchedness than now. For Time, in taking him, unclosed An unexpected door Of bliss for me, which grew to seem Far surer than before. Yet in my haste I overlooked When secondly I sued That then, as not at first, she had learnt The call of motherhood. . . . Her word is steadfast, and I know How firmly pledged are we: But a new love-claim shares her since She smiled as maid on me! AT A HASTY WEDDING (TRIOLET) If hours be years the twain are blest, For now they solace swift desire By bonds of every bond the best, If hours be years. The twain are blest Do eastern stars slope never west, Nor pallid ashes follow fire: If hours be years the twain are blest, For now they solace swift desire. THE DREAM-FOLLOWER A dream of mine flew over the mead To the halls where my old Love reigns; And it drew me on to follow its lead: And I stood at her window-panes; And I saw but a thing of flesh and bone Speeding on to its cleft in the clay; And my dream was scared, and expired on a moan, And I whitely hastened away. HIS IMMORTALITY I I saw a dead man's finer part Shining within each faithful heart Of those bereft. Then said I: “This must be His immortality.” II I looked there as the seasons wore, And still his soul continuously bore A life in theirs. But less its shine excelled Than when I first beheld. III His fellow-yearsmen passed, and then In later hearts I looked for him again; And found him—shrunk, alas! into a thin And spectral mannikin. IV Lastly I ask—now old and chill— If aught of him remain unperished still; And find, in me alone, a feeble spark, Dying amid the dark. February 1899. THE TO-BE-FORGOTTEN I I heard a small sad sound, And stood awhile among the tombs around: “Wherefore, old friends,” said I, “are you distrest, Now, screened from life's unrest?” II —“O not at being here; But that our future second death is near; When, with the living, memory of us numbs, And blank oblivion comes! III “These, our sped ancestry, Lie here embraced by deeper death than we; Nor shape nor thought of theirs can you descry With keenest backward eye. IV “They count as quite forgot; They are as men who have existed not; Theirs is a loss past loss of fitful breath; It is the second death. V “We here, as yet, each day Are blest with dear recall; as yet, can say We hold in some soul loved continuance Of shape and voice and glance. VI “But what has been will be— First memory, then oblivion's swallowing sea; Like men foregone, shall we merge into those Whose story no one knows. VII “For which of us could hope To show in life that world-awakening scope Granted the few whose memory none lets die, But all men magnify? VIII “We were but Fortune's sport; Things true, things lovely, things of good report We neither shunned nor sought . . . We see our bourne, And seeing it we mourn.” WIVES IN THE SERE I Never a careworn wife but shows, If a joy suffuse her, Something beautiful to those Patient to peruse her, Some one charm the world unknows Precious to a muser, Haply what, ere years were foes, Moved her mate to choose her. II But, be it a hint of rose That an instant hues her, Or some early light or pose Wherewith thought renews her— Seen by him at full, ere woes Practised to abuse her— Sparely comes it, swiftly goes, Time again subdues her. THE SUPERSEDED I As newer comers crowd the fore, We drop behind. —We who have laboured long and sore Times out of mind, And keen are yet, must not regret To drop behind. II Yet there are some of us who grieve To go behind; Staunch, strenuous souls who scarce believe Their fires declined, And know none spares, remembers, cares Who go behind. III 'Tis not that we have unforetold The drop behind; We feel the new must oust the old In every kind; But yet we think, must we, must we, Too, drop behind? AN AUGUST MIDNIGHT I A shaded lamp and a waving blind, And the beat of a clock from a distant floor: On this scene enter—winged, horned, and spined— A longlegs, a moth, and a dumbledore; While 'mid my page there idly stands A sleepy fly, that rubs its hands . . . II Thus meet we five, in this still place, At this point of time, at this point in space. —My guests besmear my new-penned line, Or bang at the lamp and fall supine. “God's humblest, they!” I muse. Yet why? They know Earth-secrets that know not I. Max Gate, 1899. THE CAGED THRUSH FREED AND HOME AGAIN (VILLANELLE) “Men know but little more than we, Who count us least of things terrene, How happy days are made to be! “Of such strange tidings what think ye, O birds in brown that peck and preen? Men know but little more than we! “When I was borne from yonder tree In bonds to them, I hoped to glean How happy days are made to be, “And want and wailing turned to glee; Alas, despite their mighty mien Men know but little more than we! “They cannot change the Frost's decree, They cannot keep the skies serene; How happy days are made to be “Eludes great Man's sagacity No less than ours, O tribes in treen! Men know but little more than we How happy days are made to be.” BIRDS AT WINTER NIGHTFALL (TRIOLET) Around the house the flakes fly faster, And all the berries now are gone From holly and cotonea-aster Around the house. The flakes fly!—faster Shutting indoors that crumb-outcaster We used to see upon the lawn Around the house. The flakes fly faster, And all the berries now are gone! Max Gate. THE PUZZLED GAME-BIRDS (TRIOLET) They are not those who used to feed us When we were young—they cannot be— These shapes that now bereave and bleed us? They are not those who used to feed us, For did we then cry, they would heed us. —If hearts can house such treachery They are not those who used to feed us When we were young—they cannot be! WINTER IN DURNOVER FIELD (TRIOLET) Scene.—A wide stretch of fallow ground recently sown with wheat, and frozen to iron hardness. Three large birds walking about thereon, and wistfully eyeing the surface. Wind keen from north-east: sky a dull grey. Rook.— Throughout the field I find no grain; The cruel frost encrusts the cornland! Starling.— Aye: patient pecking now is vain Throughout the field, I find . . . Rook.— No grain! Pigeon.— Nor will be, comrade, till it rain, Or genial thawings loose the lorn land Throughout the field. Rook.— I find no grain: The cruel frost encrusts the cornland! THE LAST CHRYSANTHEMUM Why should this flower delay so long To show its tremulous plumes? Now is the time of plaintive robin-song, When flowers are in their tombs. Through the slow summer, when the sun Called to each frond and whorl That all he could for flowers was being done, Why did it not uncurl? It must have felt that fervid call Although it took no heed, Waking but now, when leaves like corpses fall, And saps all retrocede. Too late its beauty, lonely thing, The season's shine is spent, Nothing remains for it but shivering In tempests turbulent. Had it a reason for delay, Dreaming in witlessness That for a bloom so delicately gay Winter would stay its stress? —I talk as if the thing were born With sense to work its mind; Yet it is but one mask of many worn By the Great Face behind. THE DARKLING THRUSH I leant upon a coppice gate When Frost was spectre-gray, And Winter's dregs made desolate The weakening eye of day. The tangled bine-stems scored the sky Like strings of broken lyres, And all mankind that haunted nigh Had sought their household fires. The land's sharp features seemed to be The Century's corpse outleant, His crypt the cloudy canopy, The wind his death-lament. The ancient pulse of germ and birth Was shrunken hard and dry, And every spirit upon earth Seemed fervourless as I. At once a voice arose among The bleak twigs overhead In a full-hearted evensong Of joy illimited; An aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small, In blast-beruffled plume, Had chosen thus to fling his soul Upon the growing gloom. So little cause for carolings Of such ecstatic sound Was written on terrestrial things Afar or nigh around, That I could think there trembled through His happy good-night air Some blessed Hope, whereof he knew And I was unaware. 31st December 1900. THE COMET AT YELL'HAM I It bends far over Yell'ham Plain, And we, from Yell'ham Height, Stand and regard its fiery train, So soon to swim from sight. II It will return long years hence, when As now its strange swift shine Will fall on Yell'ham; but not then On that sweet form of thine. MAD JUDY When the hamlet hailed a birth Judy used to cry: When she heard our christening mirth She would kneel and sigh. She was crazed, we knew, and we Humoured her infirmity. When the daughters and the sons Gathered them to wed, And we like-intending ones Danced till dawn was red, She would rock and mutter, “More Comers to this stony shore!” When old Headsman Death laid hands On a babe or twain, She would feast, and by her brands Sing her songs again. What she liked we let her do, Judy was insane, we knew. A WASTED ILLNESS Through vaults of pain, Enribbed and wrought with groins of ghastliness, I passed, and garish spectres moved my brain To dire distress. And hammerings, And quakes, and shoots, and stifling hotness, blent With webby waxing things and waning things As on I went. “Where lies the end To this foul way?” I asked with weakening breath. Thereon ahead I saw a door extend— The door to Death. It loomed more clear: “At last!” I cried. “The all-delivering door!” And then, I knew not how, it grew less near Than theretofore. And back slid I Along the galleries by which I came, And tediously the day returned, and sky, And life—the same. And all was well: Old circumstance resumed its former show, And on my head the dews of comfort fell As ere my woe. I roam anew, Scarce conscious of my late distress. . . . And yet Those backward steps to strength I cannot view Without regret. For that dire train Of waxing shapes and waning, passed before, And those grim chambers, must be ranged again To reach that door. A MAN (IN MEMORY OF H. OF M.) I In Casterbridge there stood a noble pile, Wrought with pilaster, bay, and balustrade In tactful times when shrewd Eliza swayed.— On burgher, squire, and clown It smiled the long street down for near a mile. II But evil days beset that domicile; The stately beauties of its roof and wall Passed into sordid hands. Condemned to fall Were cornice, quoin, and cove, And all that art had wove in antique style. III Among the hired dismantlers entered there One till the moment of his task untold. When charged therewith he gazed, and answered bold: “Be needy I or no, I will not help lay low a house so fair! IV “Hunger is hard. But since the terms be such— No wage, or labour stained with the disgrace Of wrecking what our age cannot replace To save its tasteless soul— I'll do without your dole. Life is not much!” V Dismissed with sneers he backed his tools and went, And wandered workless; for it seemed unwise To close with one who dared to criticize And carp on points of taste: Rude men should work where placed, and be content. VI Years whiled. He aged, sank, sickened; and was not. And it was said, “A man intractable And curst is gone.” None sighed to hear his knell, None sought his churchyard-place; His name, his rugged face, were soon forgot. VII The stones of that fair hall lie far and wide, And but a few recall its ancient mould; Yet when I pass the spot I long to hold As truth what fancy saith: “His protest lives where deathless things abide!” THE DAME OF ATHELHALL I “Dear! Shall I see thy face,” she said, “In one brief hour? And away with thee from a loveless bed To a far-off sun, to a vine-wrapt bower, And be thine own unseparated, And challenge the world's white glower?” II She quickened her feet, and met him where They had predesigned: And they clasped, and mounted, and cleft the air Upon whirling wheels; till the will to bind Her life with his made the moments there Efface the years behind. III Miles slid, and the port uprose to view As they sped on; When slipping its bond the bracelet flew From her fondled arm. Replaced anon, Its cameo of the abjured one drew Her musings thereupon. IV The gaud with his image once had been A gift from him: And so it was that its carving keen Refurbished memories wearing dim, Which set in her soul a twinge of teen, And a tear on her lashes' brim. V “I may not go!” she at length outspake, “Thoughts call me back— I would still lose all for your dear, true sake; My heart is thine, friend! But my track Home, home to Athelhall I must take To hinder household wrack!” VI He was wroth. And they parted, weak and wan; And he left the shore; His ship diminished, was low, was gone; And she heard in the waves as the daytide wore, And read in the leer of the sun that shone, That they parted for evermore. VII She homed as she came, at the dip of eve On Athel Coomb Regaining the Hall she had sworn to leave. The house was soundless as a tomb, And she stole to her chamber, there to grieve Lone, kneeling, in the gloom. VIII From the lawn without rose her husband's voice To one his friend: “Another her Love, another my choice, Her going is good. Our conditions mend; In a change of mates we shall both rejoice; I hoped that it thus might end! IX “A quick divorce; she will make him hers, And I wed mine. So Time rights all things in long, long years— Or rather she, by her bold design! I admire a woman no balk deters: She has blessed my life, in fine. X “I shall build new rooms for my new true bride, Let the bygone be: By now, no doubt, she has crossed the tide With the man to her mind. Far happier she In some warm vineland by his side Than ever she was with me.” THE SEASONS OF HER YEAR I Winter is white on turf and tree, And birds are fled; But summer songsters pipe to me, And petals spread, For what I dreamt of secretly His lips have said! II O 'tis a fine May morn, they say, And blooms have blown; But wild and wintry is my day, My song-birds moan; For he who vowed leaves me to pay Alone—alone! THE MILKMAID Under a daisied bank There stands a rich red ruminating cow, And hard against her flank A cotton-hooded milkmaid bends her brow. The flowery river-ooze Upheaves and falls; the milk purrs in the pail; Few pilgrims but would choose The peace of such a life in such a vale. The maid breathes words—to vent, It seems, her sense of Nature's scenery, Of whose life, sentiment, And essence, very part itself is she. She bends a glance of pain, And, at a moment, lets escape a tear; Is it that passing train, Whose alien whirr offends her country ear?— Nay! Phyllis does not dwell On visual and familiar things like these; What moves her is the spell Of inner themes and inner poetries: Could but by Sunday morn Her gay new gown come, meads might dry to dun, Trains shriek till ears were torn, If Fred would not prefer that Other One. THE LEVELLED CHURCHYARD “O Passenger, pray list and catch Our sighs and piteous groans, Half stifled in this jumbled patch Of wrenched memorial stones! “We late-lamented, resting here, Are mixed to human jam, And each to each exclaims in fear, ‘I know not which I am!’ “The wicked people have annexed The verses on the good; A roaring drunkard sports the text Teetotal Tommy should! “Where we are huddled none can trace, And if our names remain, They pave some path or porch or place Where we have never lain! “Here's not a modest maiden elf But dreads the final Trumpet, Lest half of her should rise herself, And half some sturdy strumpet! “From restorations of Thy fane, From smoothings of Thy sward, From zealous Churchmen's pick and plane Deliver us O Lord! Amen!” 1882. THE RUINED MAID “O 'melia, my dear, this does everything crown! Who could have supposed I should meet you in Town? And whence such fair garments, such prosperi-ty?”— “O didn't you know I'd been ruined?” said she. —“You left us in tatters, without shoes or socks, Tired of digging potatoes, and spudding up docks; And now you've gay bracelets and bright feathers three!”— “Yes: that's how we dress when we're ruined,” said she. —“At home in the barton you said ‘thee’ and ‘thou,’ And ‘thik oon,’ and ‘theäs oon,’ and ‘t'other’; but now Your talking quite fits 'ee for high compa-ny!”— “Some polish is gained with one's ruin,” said she. —“Your hands were like paws then, your face blue and bleak But now I'm bewitched by your delicate cheek, And your little gloves fit as on any la-dy!”— “We never do work when we're ruined,” said she. —“You used to call home-life a hag-ridden dream, And you'd sigh, and you'd sock; but at present you seem To know not of megrims or melancho-ly!”— “True. One's pretty lively when ruined,” said she. —“I wish I had feathers, a fine sweeping gown, And a delicate face, and could strut about Town!”— “My dear—a raw country girl, such as you be, Cannot quite expect that. You ain't ruined,” said she. Westbourne Park Villas, 1866. THE RESPECTABLE BURGHER ON “THE HIGHER CRITICISM” Since Reverend Doctors now declare That clerks and people must prepare To doubt if Adam ever were; To hold the flood a local scare; To argue, though the stolid stare, That everything had happened ere The prophets to its happening sware; That David was no giant-slayer, Nor one to call a God-obeyer In certain details we could spare, But rather was a debonair Shrewd bandit, skilled as banjo-player: That Solomon sang the fleshly Fair, And gave the Church no thought whate'er, That Esther with her royal wear, And Mordecai, the son of Jair, And Joshua's triumphs, Job's despair, And Balaam's ass's bitter blare; Nebuchadnezzar's furnace-flare, And Daniel and the den affair, And other stories rich and rare, Were writ to make old doctrine wear Something of a romantic air: That the Nain widow's only heir, And Lazarus with cadaverous glare (As done in oils by Piombo's care) Did not return from Sheol's lair: That Jael set a fiendish snare, That Pontius Pilate acted square, That never a sword cut Malchus' ear; And (but for shame I must forbear) That ? ? did not reappear! . . . —Since thus they hint, nor turn a hair, All churchgoing will I forswear, And sit on Sundays in my chair, And read that moderate man Voltaire. ARCHITECTURAL MASKS I There is a house with ivied walls, And mullioned windows worn and old, And the long dwellers in those halls Have souls that know but sordid calls, And daily dote on gold. II In blazing brick and plated show Not far away a “villa” gleams, And here a family few may know, With book and pencil, viol and bow, Lead inner lives of dreams. III The philosophic passers say, “See that old mansion mossed and fair, Poetic souls therein are they: And O that gaudy box! Away, You vulgar people there.” THE TENANT-FOR-LIFE The sun said, watching my watering-pot: “Some morn you'll pass away; These flowers and plants I parch up hot— Who'll water them that day? “Those banks and beds whose shape your eye Has planned in line so true, New hands will change, unreasoning why Such shape seemed best to you. “Within your house will strangers sit, And wonder how first it came; They'll talk of their schemes for improving it, And will not mention your name. “They'll care not how, or when, or at what You sighed, laughed, suffered here, Though you feel more in an hour of the spot Than they will feel in a year. “As I look on at you here, now, Shall I look on at these; But as to our old times, avow No knowledge—hold my peace! . . . “O friend, it matters not, I say; Bethink ye, I have shined On nobler ones than you, and they Are dead men out of mind!” THE KING'S EXPERIMENT It was a wet wan hour in spring, And Nature met King Doom beside a lane, Wherein Hodge tramped, all blithely ballading The Mother's smiling reign. “Why warbles he that skies are fair And coombs alight,” she cried, “and fallows gay, When I have placed no sunshine in the air Or glow on earth to-day?” “'Tis in the comedy of things That such should be,” returned the one of Doom: “Charge now the scene with brightest blazonings, And he shall call them gloom.” She gave the word: the sunbeams broke, All Froomside shone, the hedgebirds raised a strain; And later Hodge, upon the midday stroke, Returned along the lane, Low murmuring: “O this bitter scene, And thrice accurst horizon hung with gloom! How deadly like this sky, these fields, these treen, To trappings of the tomb!” The Beldame then: “The fool and blind! Such mad perverseness who may apprehend?”— “Nay; there's no madness in it; thou shalt find Thy law there,” said her friend. “When Hodge went forth 'twas to his Love, To make her, ere this eve, his wedded prize, And Earth, despite the heaviness above, Was bright as Paradise. “But I sent on my messenger, With cunning arrows poisonous and keen, To take forthwith her laughing life from her, And dull her little een, “And white her cheek, and still her breath, Ere her too buoyant Hodge had reached her side; So, when he came, he clasped her but in death, And never as his bride. “And there's the humour, as I said; Thy dreary dawn he saw as gleaming gold, And in thy glistening green and radiant red Funereal gloom and cold.” THE TREE AN OLD MAN'S STORY I Its roots are bristling in the air Like some mad Earth-god's spiny hair; The loud south-wester's swell and yell Smote it at midnight, and it fell. Thus ends the tree Where Some One sat with me. II Its boughs, which none but darers trod, A child may step on from the sod, And twigs that earliest met the dawn Are lit the last upon the lawn. Cart off the tree Beneath whose trunk sat we! III Yes, there we sat: she cooed content, And bats ringed round, and daylight went; The gnarl, our seat, is wrenched and sunk, Prone that queer pocket in the trunk Where lay the key To her pale mystery. IV “Years back, within this pocket-hole I found, my Love, a hurried scrawl Meant not for me,” at length said I; “I glanced thereat, and let it lie: The words were three— ‘Beloved, I agree.’ V “Who placed it here; to what request It gave assent, I never guessed. Some prayer of some hot heart, no doubt, To some coy maiden hereabout, Just as, maybe, With you, Sweet Heart, and me.” VI She waited, till with quickened breath She spoke, as one who banisheth Reserves that lovecraft heeds so well, To ease some mighty wish to tell: “'Twas I,” said she, “Who wrote thus clinchingly. VII “My lover's wife—aye, wife—knew nought Of what we felt, and bore, and thought. . . . He'd said: ‘I wed with thee or die: She stands between, 'tis true. But why? Do thou agree, And—she shall cease to be.’ VIII “How I held back, how love supreme Involved me madly in his scheme Why should I say? . . . I wrote assent (You found it hid) to his intent. . . . She—died. . . . But he Came not to wed with me. IX “O shrink not, Love!—Had these eyes seen But once thine own, such had not been! But we were strangers. . . . Thus the plot Cleared passion's path.—Why came he not To wed with me? . . . He wived the gibbet-tree.” X —Under that oak of heretofore Sat Sweetheart mine with me no more: By many a Fiord, and Strom, and Fleuve Have I since wandered. . . . Soon, for love, Distraught went she— 'Twas said for love of me. HER LATE HUSBAND (KING'S HINTOCK, 182?) “No—not where I shall make my own; But dig his grave just by The woman's with the initialed stone— As near as he can lie— After whose death he seemed to ail, Though none considered why. “And when I also claim a nook, And your feet tread me in, Bestow me, in my maiden name, Among my kith and kin, That strangers gazing may not dream I did a husband win.” “Widow, your wish shall be obeyed: Though, thought I, certainly You'd lay him where your folk are laid, And your grave, too, will be, As custom hath it; you to right, And on the left hand he.” “Aye, sexton; such the Hintock rule, And none has said it nay; But now you find a native here Eschews that ancient way . . . And it may be, some Christmas night, When angels walk, they'll say: “‘O strange interment! Civilized lands Afford few types thereof; Here is a man who takes his rest Beside his very Love, Beside the one who was his wife In our sight up above!’” THE SELF-UNSEEING Here is the ancient floor, Footworn and hollowed and thin, Here was the former door Where the dead feet walked in. She sat here in her chair, Smiling into the fire; He who played stood there, Bowing it higher and higher. Childlike, I danced in a dream; Blessings emblazoned that day; Everything glowed with a gleam; Yet we were looking away! IN TENEBRIS I “Percussus sum sicut foenum, et aruit cor meum.” —Ps. ci. Wintertime nighs; But my bereavement-pain It cannot bring again: Twice no one dies. Flower-petals flee; But, since it once hath been, No more that severing scene Can harrow me. Birds faint in dread: I shall not lose old strength In the lone frost's black length: Strength long since fled! Leaves freeze to dun; But friends can not turn cold This season as of old For him with none. Tempests may scath; But love can not make smart Again this year his heart Who no heart hath. Black is night's cope; But death will not appal One who, past doubtings all, Waits in unhope. IN TENEBRIS II “Considerabam ad dexteram, et videbam; et non erat qui cognosceret me. . . . Non est qui requirat animam meam.” —Ps. cxli. When the clouds' swoln bosoms echo back the shouts of the many and strong That things are all as they best may be, save a few to be right ere long, And my eyes have not the vision in them to discern what to these is so clear, The blot seems straightway in me alone; one better he were not here. The stout upstanders say, All's well with us: ruers have nought to rue! And what the potent say so oft, can it fail to be somewhat true? Breezily go they, breezily come; their dust smokes around their career, Till I think I am one born out of due time, who has no calling here. Their dawns bring lusty joys, it seems; their evenings all that is sweet; Our times are blessed times, they cry: Life shapes it as is most meet, And nothing is much the matter; there are many smiles to a tear; Then what is the matter is I, I say. Why should such an one be here? . . . Let him in whose ears the low-voiced Best is killed by the clash of the First, Who holds that if way to the Better there be, it exacts a full look at the Worst, Who feels that delight is a delicate growth cramped by crookedness, custom, and fear, Get him up and be gone as one shaped awry; he disturbs the order here. 1895–96. IN TENEBRIS III “Heu mihi, quia incolatus meus prolongatus est! Habitavi cum habitantibus Cedar; multum incola fuit anima mea.” —Ps. cxix. There have been times when I well might have passed and the ending have come— Points in my path when the dark might have stolen on me, artless, unrueing— Ere I had learnt that the world was a welter of futile doing: Such had been times when I well might have passed, and the ending have come! Say, on the noon when the half-sunny hours told that April was nigh, And I upgathered and cast forth the snow from the crocus-border, Fashioned and furbished the soil into a summer-seeming order, Glowing in gladsome faith that I quickened the year thereby. Or on that loneliest of eves when afar and benighted we stood, She who upheld me and I, in the midmost of Egdon together, Confident I in her watching and ward through the blackening heather, Deeming her matchless in might and with measureless scope endued. Or on that winter-wild night when, reclined by the chimney-nook quoin, Slowly a drowse overgat me, the smallest and feeblest of folk there, Weak from my baptism of pain; when at times and anon I awoke there— Heard of a world wheeling on, with no listing or longing to join. Even then! while unweeting that vision could vex or that knowledge could numb, That sweets to the mouth in the belly are bitter, and tart, and untoward, Then, on some dim-coloured scene should my briefly raised curtain have lowered, Then might the Voice that is law have said “Cease!” and the ending have come. 1896. THE CHURCH-BUILDER I The church flings forth a battled shade Over the moon-blanched sward; The church; my gift; whereto I paid My all in hand and hoard; Lavished my gains With stintless pains To glorify the Lord. II I squared the broad foundations in Of ashlared masonry; I moulded mullions thick and thin, Hewed fillet and ogee: I circleted Each sculptured head With nimb and canopy. III I called in many a craftsmaster To fix emblazoned glass, To figure Cross and Sepulchre On dossal, boss, and brass. My gold all spent, My jewels went To gem the cups of Mass. IV I borrowed deep to carve the screen And raise the ivoried Rood; I parted with my small demesne To make my owings good. Heir-looms unpriced I sacrificed, Until debt-free I stood. V So closed the task. “Deathless the Creed Here substanced!” said my soul: “I heard me bidden to this deed, And straight obeyed the call. Illume this fane, That not in vain I build it, Lord of all!” VI But, as it chanced me, then and there Did dire misfortunes burst; My home went waste for lack of care, My sons rebelled and curst; Till I confessed That aims the best Were looking like the worst. VII Enkindled by my votive work No burning faith I find; The deeper thinkers sneer and smirk, And give my toil no mind; From nod and wink I read they think That I am fool and blind. VIII My gift to God seems futile, quite; The world moves as erstwhile; And powerful Wrong on feeble Right Tramples in olden style. My faith burns down, I see no crown; But Cares, and Griefs, and Guile. IX So now, the remedy? Yea, this: I gently swing the door Here, of my fane—no soul to wis— And cross the patterned floor To the rood-screen That stands between The nave and inner chore. X The rich red windows dim the moon, But little light need I; I mount the prie-dieu, lately hewn From woods of rarest dye; Then from below My garment, so, I draw this cord, and tie XI One end thereof around the beam Midway 'twixt Cross and truss: I noose the nethermost extreme, And in ten seconds thus I journey hence— To that land whence No rumour reaches us. XII Well: Here at morn they'll light on one Dangling in mockery Of what he spent his substance on Blindly and uselessly! . . . “He might,” they'll say, “Have built, some way, A cheaper gallows-tree!” THE LOST PYX A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND On a lonely table-land above the Vale of Blackmore, between High-Stoy and Bubb-Down hills, and commanding in clear weather views that extend from the English to the Bristol Channel, stands a pillar, apparently mediæval, called Cross-and-Hand, or Christ-in-Hand. One tradition of its origin is mentioned in Tess of the d' Urbervilles; another, more detailed, preserves the story here given. Some say the spot is banned: that the pillar Cross-and-Hand Attests to a deed of hell; But of else than of bale is the mystic tale That ancient Vale-folk tell. Ere Cernel's Abbey ceased hereabout there dwelt a priest, (In later life sub-prior Of the brotherhood there, whose bones are now bare In the field that was Cernel choir). One night in his cell at the foot of yon dell The priest heard a frequent cry: “Go, father, in haste to the cot on the waste, And shrive a man waiting to die.” Said the priest in a shout to the caller without, “The night howls, the tree-trunks bow; One may barely by day track so rugged a way, And can I then do so now?” No further word from the dark was heard, And the priest moved never a limb; And he slept and dreamed; till a Visage seemed To frown from Heaven at him. In a sweat he arose; and the storm shrieked shrill, And smote as in savage joy; While High-Stoy trees twanged to Bubb-Down Hill, And Bubb-Down to High-Stoy. There seemed not a holy thing in hail, Nor shape of light or love, From the Abbey north of Blackmore Vale To the Abbey south thereof. Yet he plodded thence through the dark immense, And with many a stumbling stride Through copse and briar climbed nigh and nigher To the cot and the sick man's side. When he would have unslung the Vessels uphung To his arm in the steep ascent, He made loud moan: the Pyx was gone Of the Blessed Sacrament. Then in dolorous dread he beat his head: “No earthly prize or pelf Is the thing I've lost in tempest tossed, But the Body of Christ Himself!” He thought of the Visage his dream revealed, And turned towards whence he came, Hands groping the ground along foot-track and field And head in a heat of shame. Till here on the hill, betwixt vill and vill, He noted a clear straight ray Stretching down from the sky to a spot hard by, Which shone with the light of day. And gathered around the illumined ground Were common beasts and rare, All kneeling at gaze, and in pause profound Attent on an object there. 'Twas the Pyx, unharmed 'mid the circling rows Of Blackmore's hairy throng, Whereof were oxen, sheep, and does, And hares from the brakes among; And badgers grey, and conies keen, And squirrels of the tree, And many a member seldom seen Of Nature's family. The ireful winds that scoured and swept Through coppice, clump, and dell, Within that holy circle slept Calm as in hermit's cell. Then the priest bent likewise to the sod And thanked the Lord of Love, And Blessed Mary, Mother of God, And all the saints above. And turning straight with his priceless freight, He reached the dying one, Whose passing sprite had been stayed for the rite Without which bliss hath none. And when by grace the priest won place, And served the Abbey well, He reared this stone to mark where shone That midnight miracle. TESS'S LAMENT I I would that folk forgot me quite, Forgot me quite! I would that I could shrink from sight, And no more see the sun. Would it were time to say farewell, To claim my nook, to need my knell, Time for them all to stand and tell Of my day's work as done II Ah! dairy where I lived so long, I lived so long; Where I would rise up staunch and strong, And lie down hopefully. 'Twas there within the chimney-seat He watched me to the clock's slow beat— Loved me, and learnt to call me Sweet, And whispered words to me. III And now he's gone; and now he's gone; . . . And now he's gone! The flowers we potted perhaps are thrown To rot upon the farm. And where we had our supper-fire May now grow nettle, dock, and briar, And all the place be mould and mire So cozy once and warm. IV And it was I who did it all, Who did it all; 'Twas I who made the blow to fall On him who thought no guile. Well, it is finished—past, and he Has left me to my misery, And I must take my Cross on me For wronging him awhile. V How gay we looked that day we wed, That day we wed! “May joy be with ye!” they all said A-standing by the durn. I wonder what they say o'us now, And if they know my lot; and how She feels who milks my favourite cow, And takes my place at churn! VI It wears me out to think of it, To think of it; I cannot bear my fate as writ, I'd have my life unbe; Would turn my memory to a blot, Make every relic of me rot, My doings be as they were not, And gone all trace of me! THE SUPPLANTER A TALE I He bends his travel-tarnished feet To where she wastes in clay: From day-dawn until eve he fares Along the wintry way; From day-dawn until eve he bears A wreath of blooms and bay. II “Are these the gravestone shapes that meet My forward-straining view? Or forms that cross a window-blind In circle, knot, and queue: Gay forms, that cross and whirl and wind To music throbbing through?”— III “The Keeper of the Field of Tombs Dwells by its gateway-pier; He celebrates with feast and dance His daughter's twentieth year: He celebrates with wine of France The birthday of his dear.”— IV “The gates are shut when evening glooms: Lay down your wreath, sad wight; To-morrow is a time more fit For placing flowers aright: The morning is the time for it; Come, wake with us to-night!”— V He drops his wreath, and enters in, And sits, and shares their cheer.— ‘I fain would foot with you, young man, Before all others here; I fain would foot it for a span With such a cavalier!” VI She coaxes, clasps, nor fails to win His first-unwilling hand: The merry music strikes its staves, The dancers quickly band; And with the Damsel of the Graves He duly takes his stand. VII “You dance divinely, stranger swain, Such grace I've never known. O longer stay! Breathe not adieu And leave me here alone! O longer stay: to her be true Whose heart is all your own!”— VIII “I mark a phantom through the pane, That beckons in despair, Its mouth all drawn with heavy moan— Her to whom once I sware!”— “Nay; 'tis the lately carven stone Of some strange girl laid there!”— IX “I see white flowers upon the floor Betrodden to a clot; My wreath were they?”—“Nay; love me much, Swear you'll forget me not! 'Twas but a wreath! Full many such Are brought here and forgot.” X The watches of the night grow hoar, He wakens with the sun; “Now could I kill thee here!” he says, “For winning me from one Who ever in her living days Was pure as cloistered nun!” XI She cowers; and, rising, roves he then Afar for many a mile, For evermore to be apart From her who could beguile His senses by her burning heart, And win his love awhile. XII A year beholds him wend again To her who wastes in clay; From day-dawn until eve he fares Along the wintry way, From day-dawn until eve repairs Towards her mound to pray. XIII And there he sets him to fulfil His frustrate first intent: And lay upon her bed, at last, The offering earlier meant: When, on his stooping figure, ghast And haggard eyes are bent. XIV “O surely for a little while You can be kind to me. For do you love her, do you hate, She knows not—cares not she: Only the living feel the weight Of loveless misery! XV “I own my sin; I've paid its cost, Being outcast, shamed, and bare: I give you daily my whole heart, Your child my tender care, I pour you prayers; this life apart Is more than I can bear!” XVI He turns—unpitying, passion-tossed; “I know you not!” he cries, “Nor know your child. I knew this maid, But she's in Paradise!” And he has vanished in the shade From her beseeching eyes. IMITATIONS, ETC. SAPPHIC FRAGMENT “Thou shalt be—Nothing.” —Omar Khayyam. “Tombless, with no remembrance.” W. Shakespeare. Dead shalt thou lie; and nought Be told of thee or thought, For thou hast plucked not of the Muses' tree: And even in Hades' halls Amidst thy fellow-thralls No friendly shade thy shade shall company! CATULLUS: XXXI (After passing Sirmione, April 1887) Sirmio, thou dearest dear of strands That Neptune strokes in lake and sea, With what high joy from stranger lands Doth thy old friend set foot on thee! Yea, barely seems it true to me That no Bithynia holds me now, But calmly and assuringly Around me stretchest homely Thou. Is there a scene more sweet than when Our clinging cares are undercast, And, worn by alien moils and men, The long untrodden sill repassed, We press the pined for couch at last, And find a full repayment there? Then hail, sweet Sirmio; thou that wast, And art, mine own unrivalled Fair! AFTER SCHILLER Knight, a true sister-love This heart retains; Ask me no other love, That way lie pains! Calm must I view thee come, Calm see thee go; Tale-telling tears of thine I must not know! SONG FROM HEINE I scanned her picture, dreaming, Till each dear line and hue Was imaged, to my seeming, As if it lived anew. Her lips began to borrow Their former wondrous smile; Her fair eyes, faint with sorrow, Grew sparkling as erstwhile. Such tears as often ran not Ran then, my love, for thee; And O, believe I cannot That thou art lost to me! FROM VICTOR HUGO Child, were I king, I'd yield my royal rule, My chariot, sceptre, vassal-service due, My crown, my porphyry-basined waters cool, My fleets, whereto the sea is but a pool, For a glance from you! Love, were I God, the earth and its heaving airs, Angels, the demons abject under me, Vast chaos with its teeming womby lairs, Time, space, all would I give—aye, upper spheres, For a kiss from thee! CARDINAL BEMBO'S EPITAPH ON RAPHAEL Here's one in whom Nature feared—faint at such vying— Eclipse while he lived, and decease at his dying. RETROSPECT “I HAVE LIVED WITH SHADES” I I have lived with Shades so long, And talked to them so oft, Since forth from cot and croft I went mankind among, That sometimes they In their dim style Will pause awhile To hear my say; II And take me by the hand, And lead me through their rooms In the To-be, where Dooms Half-wove and shapeless stand: And show from there The dwindled dust And rot and rust Of things that were. III “Now turn,” they said to me One day: “Look whence we came, And signify his name Who gazes thence at thee.”— —“Nor name nor race Know I, or can,” I said, “Of man So commonplace. IV “He moves me not at all; I note no ray or jot Of rareness in his lot, Or star exceptional. Into the dim Dead throngs around He'll sink, nor sound Be left of him.” V “Yet,” said they, “his frail speech, Hath accents pitched like thine— Thy mould and his define A likeness each to each— But go! Deep pain Alas, would be His name to thee, And told in vain!” February 2, 1899. MEMORY AND I “O memory, where is now my youth, Who used to say that life was truth?” “I saw him in a crumbled cot Beneath a tottering tree; That he as phantom lingers there Is only known to me.” “O Memory, where is now my joy, Who lived with me in sweet employ?” “I saw him in gaunt gardens lone, Where laughter used to be; That he as phantom wanders there Is known to none but me.” “O Memory, where is now my hope, Who charged with deeds my skill and scope?’ “I saw her in a tomb of tomes, Where dreams are wont to be; That she as spectre haunteth there Is only known to me.” “O Memory, where is now my faith, One time a champion, now a wraith?” “I saw her in a ravaged aisle, Bowed down on bended knee; That her poor ghost outflickers there Is known to none but me.” “O Memory, where is now my love, That rayed me as a god above?” “I saw her in an ageing shape Where beauty used to be; That her fond phantom lingers there Is only known to me.” ???????? ????. Long have I framed weak phantasies of Thee, O Willer masked and dumb! Who makest Life become,— As though by labouring all-unknowingly, Like one whom reveries numb. How much of consciousness informs Thy will, Thy biddings, as if blind, Of death-inducing kind, Nought shows to us ephemeral ones who fill But moments in Thy mind. Perhaps Thy ancient rote-restricted ways Thy ripening rule transcends; That listless effort tends To grow percipient with advance of days, And with percipience mends. For, in unwonted purlieus, far and nigh, At whiles or short or long, May be discerned a wrong Dying as of self-slaughter; whereat I Would raise my voice in song.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[TIME'S LAUGHING STOCKS AND OTHER VERSES.] TIME'S LAUGHINGSTOCKS THE REVISITATION As I lay awake at night-time In an ancient country barrack known to ancient cannoneers, And recalled the hopes that heralded each seeming brave and bright time Of my primal purple years, Much it haunted me that, nigh there, I had borne my bitterest loss—when One who went, came not again; In a joyless hour of discord, in a joyless-hued July there— A July just such as then. And as thus I brooded longer, With my faint eyes on the feeble square of wan-lit window frame, A quick conviction sprung within me, grew, and grew yet stronger That the month-night was the same, Too, as that which saw her leave me On the rugged ridge of Waterstone, the peewits plaining round: And a lapsing twenty years had ruled that—as it were to grieve me— I should near the once-loved ground. Though but now a war-worn stranger Chance had quartered here, I rose up and descended to the yard. All was soundless, save the troopers' horses tossing at the manger, And the sentry keeping guard. Through the gateway I betook me Down the High Street and beyond the lamps, across the battered bridge, Till the country darkness clasped me and the friendly shine forsook me, And I bore towards the Ridge, With a dim unowned emotion Saying softly: “Small my reason, now at midnight, to be here . . . . Yet a sleepless swain of fifty with a brief romantic notion May retrace a track so dear.” Thus I walked with thoughts half-uttered Up the lane I knew so well, the grey, gaunt, lonely Lane of Slyre; And at whiles behind me, far at sea, a sullen thunder muttered As I mounted high and higher. Till, the upper roadway quitting, I adventured on the open drouthy downland thinly grassed, While the spry white scuts of conies flashed before me, earthward flitting, And an arid wind went past. Round about me bulged the barrows As before, in antique silence—immemorial funeral piles— Where the sleek herds trampled daily the remains of flint-tipt arrows Mid the thyme and chamomiles; And the Sarsen stone there, dateless, On whose breast we had sat and told the zephyrs many a tender vow, Held the heat of yester sun, as sank thereon one fated mateless From those far fond hours till now. Maybe flustered by my presence Rose the peewits, just as all those years back, wailing soft and loud, And revealing their pale pinions like a fitful phosphorescence Up against the cope of cloud, Where their dolesome exclamations Seemed the voicings of the self-same throats I had heard when life was green, Though since that day uncounted frail forgotten generations Of their kind had flecked the scene.— And so, living long and longer In a past that lived no more, my eyes discerned there, suddenly, That a figure broke the skyline—first in vague contour, then stronger, And was crossing near to me. Some long-missed familiar gesture, Something wonted, struck me in the figure's pause to list and heed, Till I fancied from its handling of its loosely wrapping vesture That it might be She indeed. 'Twas not reasonless: below there In the vale, had been her home; the nook might hold her even yet, And the downlands were her father's fief; she still might come and go there;— So I rose, and said, “Agnette!” With a little leap, half-frightened, She withdrew some steps; then letting intuition smother fear In a place so long-accustomed, and as one whom thought enlightened, She replied: “What—that voice?—here!” “Yes, Agnette!—And did the occasion Of our marching hither make you think I might walk where we two—” “O, I often come,” she murmured with a moment's coy evasion, “('Tis not far),—and—think of you.” Then I took her hand, and led her To the ancient people's stone whereon I had sat. There now sat we; And together talked, until the first reluctant shyness fled her, And she spoke confidingly. “It is just as ere we parted!” Said she, brimming high with joy.—“And when, then, came you here, and why?” “—Dear, I could not sleep for thinking of our trystings when twin-hearted.” She responded, “Nor could I. “There are few things I would rather Than be wandering at this spirit-hour—lone-lived, my kindred dead— On this wold of well-known feature I inherit from my father: Night or day, I have no dread . . . . “O I wonder, wonder whether Any heartstring bore a signal-thrill between us twain or no?— Some such influence can, at times, they say, draw severed souls together.” I said, “Dear, we'll dream it so.” Each one's hand the other's grasping, And a mutual forgiveness won, we sank to silent thought, A large content in us that seemed our rended lives reclasping, And contracting years to nought. Till I, maybe overweary From the lateness, and a wayfaring so full of strain and stress For one no longer buoyant, to a peak so steep and eery, Sank to slow unconsciousness . . . . How long I slept I knew not, But the brief warm summer night had slid when, to my swift surprise, A red upedging sun, of glory chambered mortals view not, Was blazing on my eyes, From the Milton Woods to Dole-Hill All the spacious landscape lighting, and around about my feet Flinging tall thin tapering shadows from the meanest mound and mole-hill, And on trails the ewes had beat. She was sitting still beside me, Dozing likewise; and I turned to her, to take her hanging hand; When, the more regarding, that which like a spectre shook and tried me In her image then I scanned; That which Time's transforming chisel Had been tooling night and day for twenty years, and tooled too well, In its rendering of crease where curve was, where was raven, grizzle— Pits, where peonies once did dwell. She had wakened, and perceiving (I surmise) my sigh and shock, my quite involuntary dismay, Up she started, and—her wasted figure all throughout it heaving— Said, “Ah, yes: I am thus by day! “Can you really wince and wonder That the sunlight should reveal you such a thing of skin and bone, As if unaware a Death's-head must of need lie not far under Flesh whose years out-count your own? “Yes: that movement was a warning Of the worth of man's devotion!—Yes, Sir, I am old,” said she, “And the thing which should increase love turns it quickly into scorning— And your new-won heart from me!” Then she went, ere I could call her, With the too proud temper ruling that had parted us before, And I saw her form descend the slopes, and smaller grow and smaller, Till I caught its course no more . . . . True; I might have dogged her downward; —But it may be (though I know not) that this trick on us of Time Disconcerted and confused me.—Soon I bent my footsteps townward, Like to one who had watched a crime. Well I knew my native weakness, Well I know it still. I cherished her reproach like physic-wine, For I saw in that emaciate shape of bitterness and bleakness A nobler soul than mine. Did I not return, then, ever?— Did we meet again?—mend all?—Alas, what greyhead perseveres!— Soon I got the Route elsewhither.—Since that hour I have seen her never: Love is lame at fifty years. A TRAMPWOMAN'S TRAGEDY (182?) I From Wynyard's Gap the livelong day. The livelong day, We beat afoot the northward way We had travelled times before. The sun-blaze burning on our backs, Our shoulders sticking to our packs, By fosseway, fields, and turnpike tracks We skirted sad Sedge-Moor. II Full twenty miles we jaunted on, We jaunted on,— My fancy-man, and jeering John, And Mother Lee, and I. And, as the sun drew down to west, We climbed the toilsome Poldon crest, And saw, of landskip sights the best, The inn that beamed thereby. III For months we had padded side by side, Ay, side by side Through the Great Forest, Blackmoor wide, And where the Parret ran. We'd faced the gusts on Mendip ridge, Had crossed the Yeo unhelped by bridge, Been stung by every Marshwood midge, I and my fancy-man. IV Lone inns we loved, my man and I, My man and I; “King's Stag,” “Windwhistle” The highness and dryness of Windwhistle Inn was impressed upon the writer two or three years ago, when, after climbing on a hot afternoon to the beautiful spot near which it stands and entering the inn for tea, he was informed by the landlady that none could be had, unless he would fetch water from a valley half a mile off, the house containing not a drop, owing to its situation. However, a tantalizing row of full barrels behind her back testified to a wetness of a certain sort, which was not at that time desired. high and dry, “The Horse” on Hintock Green, The cosy house at Wynyard's Gap, “The Hut” renowned on Bredy Knap, And many another wayside tap Where folk might sit unseen. V Now as we trudged—O deadly day, O deadly day!— I teased my fancy-man in play And wanton idleness. I walked alongside jeering John, I laid his hand my waist upon; I would not bend my glances on My lover's dark distress. VI Thus Poldon top at last we won, At last we won, And gained the inn at sink of sun Far-famed as “Marshal's Elm.” “Marshal's Elm”, so picturesquely situated, is no longer an inn, though the house, or part of it, still remains. It used to exhibit a fine old swinging sign. Beneath us figured tor and lea, From Mendip to the western sea— I doubt if finer sight there be Within this royal realm. VII Inside the settle all a-row— All four a-row We sat, I next to John, to show That he had wooed and won. And then he took me on his knee, And swore it was his turn to be My favoured mate, and Mother Lee Passed to my former one. VIII Then in a voice I had never heard, I had never heard, My only Love to me: “One word, My lady, if you please! Whose is the child you are like to bear?— His? After all my months o' care?” God knows 'twas not! But, O despair! I nodded—still to tease. IX Then up he sprung, and with his knife— And with his knife He let out jeering Johnny's life, Yes; there, at set of sun. The slant ray through the window nigh Gilded John's blood and glazing eye, Ere scarcely Mother Lee and I Knew that the deed was done. X The taverns tell the gloomy tale, The gloomy tale, How that at Ivel-chester jail My Love, my sweetheart swung; Though stained till now by no misdeed Save one horse ta'en in time o' need; (Blue Jimmy “Blue Jimmy” was a notorious horse-stealer of Wessex in those days, who appropriated more than a hundred horses before he was caught, among others one belonging to a neighbour of the writer's grandfather. He was hanged at the now demolished Ivel-chester or Ilchester jail above mentioned—that building formerly of so many sinister associations in the minds of the local peasantry, and the continual haunt of fever, which at last led to its condemnation. Its site is now an innocent-looking green meadow. stole right many a steed Ere his last fling he flung.) XI Thereaft I walked the world alone, Alone, alone! On his death-day I gave my groan And dropt his dead-born child. 'Twas nigh the jail, beneath a tree, None tending me; for Mother Lee Had died at Glaston, leaving me Unfriended on the wild. XII And in the night as I lay weak, As I lay weak, The leaves a-falling on my cheek, The red moon low declined— The ghost of him I'd die to kiss Rose up and said: “Ah, tell me this! Was the child mine, or was it his? Speak, that I rest may find!” XIII O doubt not but I told him then, I told him then, That I had kept me from all men Since we joined lips and swore. Whereat he smiled, and thinned away As the wind stirred to call up day . . . —'Tis past! And here alone I stray Haunting the Western Moor. April 1902. THE TWO ROSALINDS I The dubious daylight ended, And I walked the Town alone, unminding whither bound and why, As from each gaunt street and gaping square a mist of light ascended And dispersed upon the sky. II Files of evanescent faces Passed each other without heeding, in their travail, teen, or joy, Some in void unvisioned listlessness inwrought with pallid traces Of keen penury's annoy. III Nebulous flames in crystal cages Leered as if with discontent at city movement, murk, and grime, And as waiting some procession of great ghosts from bygone ages To exalt the ignoble time. IV In a colonnade high-lighted, By a thoroughfare where stern utilitarian traffic dinned, On a red and white emblazonment of players and parts, I sighted The name of “Rosalind,” V And her famous mates of “Arden,”, Who observed no stricter customs than “the seasons' difference” bade, Who lived with running brooks for books in Nature's wildwood garden, And called idleness their trade . . . . VI Now the poster stirred an ember Still remaining from my ardours of some forty years before, When the self-same portal on an eve it thrilled me to remember A like announcement bore; VII And expectantly I had entered, And had first beheld in human mould a Rosalind woo and plead, On whose transcendent figuring my speedy soul had centred As it had been she indeed . . . . VIII So; all other plans discarding, I resolved on entrance, bent on seeing what I once had seen, And approached the gangway of my earlier knowledge, disregarding The tract of time between. IX “The words, sir?” cried a creature Hovering mid the shine and shade as 'twixt the live world and the tomb; But the well-known numbers needed not for me a text or teacher To revive and re-illume. X Then the play. . . . But how unfitted Was this Rosalind!—a mammet quite to me, in memories nurst, And with chilling disappointment soon I sought the street I had quitted, To re-ponder on the first. XI The hag still hawked,—I met her Just without the colonnade. “So you don't like her, sir?” said she. “Ah—I was once that Rosalind!—I acted her—none better— Yes—in eighteen sixty-three. XII “Thus I won Orlando to me In my then triumphant days when I had charm and maidenhood, Now some forty years ago.—I used to say, Come woo me, woo me!” And she struck the attitude. XIII It was when I had gone there nightly; And the voice—though raucous now—was yet the old one.—Clear as noon My Rosalind was here . . . . Thereon the band withinside lightly Beat up a merry tune. A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY (circa 186?) I bore a daughter flower-fair, In Pydel Vale, alas for me; I joyed to mother one so rare, But dead and gone I now would be. Men looked and loved her as she grew, And she was won, alas for me; She told me nothing, but I knew, And saw that sorrow was to be. I knew that one had made her thrall, A thrall to him, alas for me; And then, at last, she told me all, And wondered what her end would be. She owned that she had loved too well, Had loved too well, unhappy she, And bore a secret time would tell, Though in her shroud she'd sooner be. I plodded to her sweetheart's door In Pydel Vale, alas for me: I pleaded with him, pleaded sore, To save her from her misery. He frowned, and swore he could not wed. Seven times he swore it could not be; “Poverty's worse than shame,” he said, Till all my hope went out of me. “I've packed my traps to sail the main”— Roughly he spake, alas did he— “Wessex beholds me not again, 'Tis worse than any jail would be!” —There was a shepherd whom I knew, A subtle man, alas for me: I sought him all the pastures through, Though better I had ceased to be. I traced him by his lantern light, And gave him hint, alas for me, Of how she found her in the plight That is so scorned in Christendie. “Is there an herb. . . .?” I asked. “Or none?” Yes, thus I asked him desperately. “—There is,” he said; “a certain one. . . .” Would he had sworn that none knew he! “To-morrow I will walk your way,” He hinted low, alas for me.— Fieldwards I gazed throughout next day; Now fields I never more would see! The sunset-shine, as curfew strook, As curfew strook beyond the lea, Lit his white smock and gleaming crook, While slowly he drew near to me. He pulled from underneath his smock The herb I sought, my curse to be— “At times I use it in my flock,” He said, and hope waxed strong in me. “'Tis meant to balk ill-motherings”— (Ill-motherings! Why should they be?)— “If not, would God have sent such things?” So spoke the shepherd unto me. That night I watched the poppling brew, With bended back and hand on knee: I stirred it till the dawnlight grew, And the wind whiffled wailfully. “This scandal shall be slain,” said I, “That lours upon her innocency: I'll give all whispering tongues the lie;”— But worse than whispers was to be. “Here's physic for untimely fruit,” I said to her, alas for me, Early that morn in fond salute; And in my grave I now would be. —Next Sunday came, with sweet church chimes In Pydel Vale, alas for me: I went into her room betimes; No more may such a Sunday be! “Mother, instead of rescue nigh,” She faintly breathed, alas for me, “I feel as I were like to die, And underground soon, soon should be.” From church that noon the people walked In twos and threes, alas for me, Showed their new raiment—smiled and talked, Though sackcloth-clad I longed to be. Came to my door her lover's friends, And cheerly cried, alas for me, “Right glad are we he makes amends, For never a sweeter bride can be.” My mouth dried, as 'twere scorched within, Dried at their words, alas for me: More and more neighbours crowded in, (O why should mothers ever be!) “Ha-ha! Such well-kept news!” laughed they, Yes—so they laughed, alas for me. “Whose banns were called in church to-day?”— Christ, how I wished my soul could flee! “Where is she? O the stealthy miss,” Still bantered they, alas for me, “To keep a wedding close as this . . . .” Ay, Fortune worked thus wantonly! “But you are pale—you did not know?” They archly asked, alas for me, I stammered, “Yes—some days—ago,” While coffined clay I wished to be. “'Twas done to please her, we surmise?” (They spoke quite lightly in their glee) “Done by him as a fond surprise?” I thought their words would madden me. Her lover entered. “Where's my bird?— My bird—my flower—my picotee? First time of asking, soon the third!” Ah, in my grave I well may be. To me he whispered: “Since your call— So spoke he then, alas for me— “I've felt for her, and righted all.” —I think of it to agony. “She's faint to-day—tired—nothing more— Thus did I lie, alas for me. . . . I called her at her chamber door As one who scarce had strength to be. No voice replied. I went within— O women! scourged the worst are we. . . . I shrieked. The others hastened in And saw the stroke there dealt on me. There she lay—silent, breathless, dead, Stone dead she lay—wronged, sinless she!— Ghost-white the cheeks once rosy-red: Death had took her. Death took not me. I kissed her colding face and hair, I kissed her corpse—the bride to be!— My punishment I cannot bear, But pray God not to pity me. January 1904. THE HOUSE OF HOSPITALITIES Here we broached the Christmas barrel, Pushed up the charred log-ends; Here we sang the Christmas carol, And called in friends. Time has tired me since we met here When the folk now dead were young Since the viands were outset here And quaint songs sung. And the worm has bored the viol That used to lead the tune, Rust eaten out the dial That struck night's noon. Now no Christmas brings in neighbours, And the New Year comes unlit; Where we sang the mole now labours, And spiders knit. Yet at midnight if here walking, When the moon sheets wall and tree, I see forms of old time talking, Who smile on me. BEREFT In the black winter morning No light will be struck near my eyes While the clock in the stairway is warning For five, when he used to rise. Leave the door unbarred, The clock unwound. Make my lone bed hard— Would 'twere underground! When the summer dawns clearly, And the appletree-tops seem alight, Who will undraw the curtain and cheerly Call out that the morning is bright? When I tarry at market No form will cross Durnover Lea In the gathering darkness, to hark at Grey's Bridge for the pit-pat o' me. When the supper crock's steaming, And the time is the time of his tread, I shall sit by the fire and wait dreaming In a silence as of the dead. Leave the door unbarred, The clock unwound, Make my lone bed hard— Would 'twere underground! 1901. JOHN AND JANE I He sees the world as a boisterous place Where all things bear a laughing face, And humorous scenes go hourly on, Does John. II They find the world a pleasant place Where all is ecstasy and grace, Where a light has risen that cannot wane, Do John and Jane. III They see as a palace their cottage-place, Containing a pearl of the human race, A hero, maybe, hereafter styled, Do John and Jane with a baby-child. IV They rate the world as a gruesome place, Where fair looks fade to a skull's grimace,— As a pilgrimage they would fain get done— Do John and Jane with their worthless son. THE CURATE'S KINDNESS A WORKHOUSE IRONY I I thought they'd be strangers aroun' me, But she's to be there! Let me jump out o' waggon and go back and drown me At Pummery or Ten-Hatches Weir. II I thought: “Well, I've come to the Union— The workhouse at last— After honest hard work all the week, and Communion O' Zundays, these fifty years past. III “'Tis hard; but,” I thought, “never mind it: There's gain in the end: And when I get used to the place I shall find it A home, and may find there a friend. IV “Life there will be better than t'other, For peace is assured. The men in one wing and their wives in another Is strictly the rule of the Board.” V Just then one young Pa'son arriving Steps up out of breath To the side o' the waggon wherein we were driving To Union; and calls out and saith: VI “Old folks, that harsh order is altered, Be not sick of heart! The Guardians they poohed and they pished and they paltered When urged not to keep you apart. VII “‘It is wrong,’ I maintained, ‘to divide them, Near forty years wed.’ ‘Very well, sir. We promise, then, they shall abide them In one wing together,’ they said.” VIII Then I sank—knew 'twas quite a foredone thing That misery should be To the end! . . . To get freed of her there was the one thing Had made the change welcome to me. IX To go there was ending but badly; 'Twas shame and 'twas pain; “But anyhow,” thought I, “thereby I shall gladly Get free of this forty years' chain.” X I thought they'd be strangers aroun' me, But she's to be there! Let me jump out o' waggon and go back and drown me At Pummery or Ten-Hatches Weir. THE FLIRT'S TRAGEDY (17??) Here alone by the logs in my chamber, Deserted, decrepit— Spent flames limning ghosts on the wainscot Of friends I once knew— My drama and hers begins weirdly Its dumb re-enactment, Each scene, sigh, and circumstance passing In spectral review. —Wealth was mine beyond wish when I met her— The pride of the lowland— Embowered in Tintinhull Valley By laurel and yew; And love lit my soul, notwithstanding My features' ill favour, Too obvious beside her perfections Of line and of hue. But it pleased her to play on my passion, And whet me to pleadings That won from her mirthful negations And scornings undue. Then I fled her disdains and derisions To cities of pleasure, And made me the crony of idlers In every purlieu. Of those who lent ear to my story, A needy Adonis Gave hint how to grizzle her garden From roses to rue, Could his price but be paid for so purging My scorner of scornings: Thus tempted, the lust to avenge me Germed inly and grew. I clothed him in sumptuous apparel, Consigned to him coursers, Meet equipage, liveried attendants In full retinue. So dowered, with letters of credit He wayfared to England, And spied out the manor she goddessed, And handy thereto, Set to hire him a tenantless mansion As coign-stone of vantage For testing what gross adulation Of beauty could do. He laboured through mornings and evens. On new moons and sabbaths, By wiles to enmesh her attention In park, path, and pew; And having afar played upon her, Advanced his lines nearer, And boldly outleaping conventions, Bent briskly to woo. His gay godlike face, his rare seeming Anon worked to win her, And later, at noontides and night-tides They held rendezvous. His tarriance full spent, he departed And met me in Venice, And lines from her told that my jilter Was stooping to sue. Not long could be further concealment, She pled to him humbly: “By our love and our sin, O protect me; I fly unto you!” A mighty remorse overgat me, I heard her low anguish, And there in the gloom of the calle My steel ran him through. A swift push engulphed his hot carrion Within the canal there— That still street of waters dividing The city in two. —I wandered awhile all unable To smother my torment, My brain racked by yells as from Tophet Of Satan's whole crew. A month of unrest brought me hovering At home in her precincts, To whose hiding-hole local story Afforded a clue. Exposed, and expelled by her people, Afar off in London I found her alone, in a sombre And soul-stifling mew. Still burning to make reparation I pleaded to wive her, And father her child, and thus faintly My mischief undo. She yielded, and spells of calm weather Succeeded the tempest; And one sprung of him stood as scion Of my bone and thew. . . . But Time unveils sorrows and secrets, And so it befell now: By inches the curtain was twitched at, And slowly undrew. As we lay, she and I, in the night-time, We heard the boy moaning: “O misery mine! My false father Has murdered my true!” She gasped: yea, she heard; understood it. Next day the child fled us; And nevermore sighted was even A print of his shoe. Thenceforward she shunned me, and languished; Till one day the park-pool Embraced her fair form, and extinguished Her eyes' living blue. —So; ask not what blast may account for This aspect of pallor, These bones that just prison within them Life's poor residue; But pass by, and leave unregarded A Cain to his suffering, For vengeance too dark on the woman Whose lover he slew. THE REJECTED MEMBER'S WIFE We shall see her no more On the balcony, Smiling, while hurt, at the roar As of surging sea From the stormy sturdy band Who have doomed her lord's cause, Though she waves her little hand As it were applause. Here will be candidates yet, And candidates' wives, Fervid with zeal to set Their ideals on our lives: Here will come market-men On the market-days, Here will clash now and then More such party assays. And the balcony will fill When such times are renewed, And the throng in the street will thrill With to-day's mettled mood; But she will no more stand In the sunshine there, With that wave of her white-gloved hand, And that chestnut hair. January 1906. THE FARM-WOMAN'S WINTER I If seasons all were summers, And leaves would never fall, And hopping casement-comers Were foodless not at all, And fragile folk might be here That white winds bid depart; Then one I used to see here Would warm my wasted heart! II One frail, who, bravely tilling Long hours in gripping gusts, Was mastered by their chilling, And now his ploughshare rusts. So savage winter catches The breath of limber things, And what I love he snatches, And what I love not, brings. AUTUMN IN KING'S HINTOCK PARK Here by the baring bough Raking up leaves, Often I ponder how Springtime deceives,— I, an old woman now, Raking up leaves. Here in the avenue Raking up leaves, Lords' ladies pass in view, Until one heaves Sighs at life's russet hue, Raking up leaves! Just as my shape you see Raking up leaves, I saw, when fresh and free, Those memory weaves Into grey ghosts by me, Raking up leaves. Yet, Dear, though one may sigh, Raking up leaves, New leaves will dance on high— Earth never grieves!— Will not, when missed am I Raking up leaves. 1901. SHUT OUT THAT MOON Close up the casement, draw the blind, Shut out that stealing moon, She wears too much the guise she wore Before our lutes were strewn With years-deep dust, and names we read On a white stone were hewn. Step not forth on the dew-dashed lawn To view the Lady's Chair, Immense Orion's glittering form, The Less and Greater Bear: Stay in; to such sights we were drawn When faded ones were fair. Brush not the bough for midnight scents That come forth lingeringly, And wake the same sweet sentiments They breathed to you and me When living seemed a laugh, and love All it was said to be. Within the common lamp-lit room Prison my eyes and thought; Let dingy details crudely loom, Mechanic speech be wrought: Too fragrant was Life's early bloom, Too tart the fruit it brought! 1904. REMINISCENCES OF A DANCING MAN I Who now remembers Almack's balls— Willis's sometime named— In those two smooth-floored upper halls For faded ones so famed? Where as we trod to trilling sound The fancied phantoms stood around, Or joined us in the maze, Of the powdered Dears from Georgian years, Whose dust lay in sightless sealed-up biers, The fairest of former days. II Who now remembers gay Cremorne, And all its jaunty jills, And those wild whirling figures born Of Jullien's grand quadrilles? With hats on head and morning coats There footed to his prancing notes Our partner-girls and we; And the gas-jets winked, and the lustres clinked, And the platform throbbed as with arms enlinked We moved to the minstrelsy. III Who now recalls those crowded rooms Of old yclept “The Argyle,” Where to the deep Drum-polka's booms We hopped in standard style? Whither have danced those damsels now! Is Death the partner who doth moue Their wormy chaps and bare? Do their spectres spin like sparks within The smoky halls of the Prince of Sin To a thunderous Jullien air? THE DEAD MAN WALKING They hail me as one living, But don't they know That I have died of late years, Untombed although? I am but a shape that stands here, A pulseless mould, A pale past picture, screening Ashes gone cold. Not at a minute's warning, Not in a loud hour, For me ceased Time's enchantments In hall and bower. There was no tragic transit, No catch of breath, When silent seasons inched me On to this death. . . . —A Troubadour-youth I rambled With Life for lyre, The beats of being raging In me like fire. But when I practised eyeing The goal of men, It iced me, and I perished A little then. When passed my friend, my kinsfolk, Through the Last Door, And left me standing bleakly, I died yet more; And when my Love's heart kindled In hate of me, Wherefore I knew not, died I One more degree. And if when I died fully I cannot say, And changed into the corpse-thing I am to-day, Yet is it that, though whiling The time somehow In walking, talking, smiling, I live not now. MORE LOVE LYRICS 1967 In five-score summers! All new eyes, New minds, new modes, new fools, new wise; New woes to weep, new joys to prize; With nothing left of me and you In that live century's vivid view Beyond a pinch of dust or two; A century which, if not sublime, Will show, I doubt not, at its prime, A scope above this blinkered time. —Yet what to me how far above? For I would only ask thereof That thy worm should be my worm, Love! 16 Westbourne Park Villas, 1867. HER DEFINITION I lingered through the night to break of day, Nor once did sleep extend a wing to me, Intently busied with a vast array Of epithets that should outfigure thee. Full-featured terms—all fitless—hastened by, And this sole speech remained: “That maiden mine!”— Debarred from due description then did I Perceive the indefinite phrase could yet define. As common chests encasing wares of price Are borne with tenderness through halls of state, For what they cover, so the poor device Of homely wording I could tolerate, Knowing its unadornment held as freight The sweetest image outside Paradise. W. P. V., Summer:. 1866. THE DIVISION Rain on the windows, creaking doors, With blasts that besom the green, And I am here, and you are there, And a hundred miles between! O were it but the weather, Dear, O were it but the miles That summed up all our severance, There might be room for smiles. But that thwart thing betwixt us twain, Which nothing cleaves or clears, Is more than distance, Dear, or rain, And longer than the years! 1893. ON THE DEPARTURE PLATFORM We kissed at the barrier; and passing through She left me, and moment by moment got Smaller and smaller, until to my view She was but a spot; A wee white spot of muslin fluff That down the diminishing platform bore Through hustling crowds of gentle and rough To the carriage door. Under the lamplight's fitful glowers, Behind dark groups from far and near, Whose interests were apart from ours, She would disappear, Then show again, till I ceased to see That flexible form, that nebulous white; And she who was more than my life to me Had vanished quite. . . . We have penned new plans since that fair fond day, And in season she will appear again— Perhaps in the same soft white array— But never as then! —“And why, young man, must eternally fly A joy you'll repeat, if you love her well?” —O friend, nought happens twice thus; why, I cannot tell! IN A CATHEDRAL CITY These people have not heard your name; No loungers in this placid place Have helped to bruit your beauty's fame. The grey Cathedral, towards whose face Bend eyes untold, has met not yours; Your shade has never swept its base, Your form has never darked its doors, Nor have your faultless feet once thrown A pensive pit-pat on its floors. Along the street to maids well known Blithe lovers hum their tender airs, But in your praise voice not a tone. . . . —Since nought bespeaks you here, or bears, As I, your imprint through and through, Here might I rest, till my heart shares The spot's unconsciousness of you! Salisbury. “I SAY I'LL SEEK HER” I say, “I'll seek her side Ere hindrance interposes;” But eve in midnight closes, And here I still abide. When darkness wears I see Her sad eyes in a vision; They ask, “What indecision Detains you, Love, from me?— “The creaking hinge is oiled, I have unbarred the backway, But you tread not the trackway And shall the thing be spoiled? “Far cockcrows echo shrill, The shadows are abating, And I am waiting, waiting; But O, you tarry still!” HER FATHER I met her, as we had privily planned, Where passing feet beat busily: She whispered: “Father is at hand! He wished to walk with me.” His presence as he joined us there Banished our words of warmth away; We felt, with cloudings of despair, What Love must lose that day. Her crimson lips remained unkissed, Our fingers kept no tender hold, His lack of feeling made the tryst Embarrassed, stiff, and cold A cynic ghost then rose and said, “But is his love for her so small That, nigh to yours, it may be read As of no worth at all? “You love her for her pink and white; But what when their fresh splendours close? His love will last her in despite Of Time, and wrack, and foes.” Weymouth. AT WAKING When night was lifting, And dawn had crept under its shade, Amid cold clouds drifting Dead-white as a corpse outlaid, With a sudden scare I seemed to behold My Love in bare Hard lines unfold. Yea, in a moment, An insight that would not die Killed her old endowment Of charm that had capped all nigh, Which vanished to none Like the gilt of a cloud, And showed her but one Of the common crowd. She seemed but a sample Of earth's poor average kind, Lit up by no ample Enrichments of mien or mind. I covered my eyes As to cover the thought, And unrecognize What the morn had taught. O vision appalling When the one believed-in thing Is seen falling, falling, With all to which hope can cling. Off: it is not true; For it cannot be That the prize I drew Is a blank to me! Weymouth, 1869. FOUR FOOTPRINTS Here are the tracks upon the sand Where stood last evening she and I— Pressed heart to heart and hand to hand; The morning sun has baked them dry. I kissed her wet face—wet with rain, For arid grief had burnt up tears, While reached us as in sleeping pain The distant gurgling of the weirs. “I have married him—yes; feel that ring; 'Tis a week ago that he put it on. . . . A dutiful daughter does this thing, And resignation succeeds anon! “But that I body and soul was yours Ere he'd possession, he'll never know. He's a confident man. ‘The husband scores,’ He says, ‘in the long run’ . . . Now, Dear, go!” I went. And to-day I pass the spot; It is only a smart the more to endure; And she whom I held is as though she were not, For they have resumed their honeymoon tour. IN THE VAULTED WAY In the vaulted way, where the passage turned To the shadowy corner that none could see, You paused for our parting,—plaintively; Though overnight had come words that burned My fond frail happiness out of me. And then I kissed you,—despite my thought That our spell must end when reflection came On what you had deemed me, whose one long aim Had been to serve you; that what I sought Lay not in a heart that could breathe such blame. But yet I kissed you; whereon you again As of old kissed me. Why, why was it so? Do you cleave to me after that light-tongued blow? If you scorned me at eventide, how love then? The thing is dark, Dear. I do not know. IN THE MIND'S EYE That was once her casement, And the taper nigh, Shining from within there, Beckoned, “Here am I!” Now, as then, I see her Moving at the pane; Ah; 'tis but her phantom Borne within my brain!— Foremost in my vision Everywhere goes she; Change dissolves the landscapes, She abides with me. Shape so sweet and shy, Dear, Who can say thee nay? Never once do I, Dear, Wish thy ghost away. THE END OF THE EPISODE Indulge no more may we In this sweet-bitter pastime: The love-light shines the last time Between you, Dear, and me. There shall remain no trace Of what so closely tied us, And blank as ere love eyed us Will be our meeting-place. The flowers and thymy air, Will they now miss our coming? The dumbles thin their humming To find we haunt not there? Though fervent was our vow, Though ruddily ran our pleasure, Bliss has fulfilled its measure, And sees its sentence now. Ache deep; but make no moans: Smile out; but stilly suffer: The paths of love are rougher Than thoroughfares of stones. THE SIGH Little head against my shoulder, Shy at first, then somewhat bolder, And up-eyed; Till she, with a timid quaver, Yielded to the kiss I gave her; But, she sighed. That there mingled with her feeling Some sad thought she was concealing It implied. —Not that she had ceased to love me, None on earth she set above me; But she sighed. She could not disguise a passion, Dread, or doubt, in weakest fashion If she tried: Nothing seemed to hold us sundered, Hearts were victors; so I wondered Why she sighed. Afterwards I knew her throughly, And she loved me staunchly, truly, Till she died; But she never made confession Why, at that first sweet concession, She had sighed. It was in our May, remember; And though now I near November, And abide Till my appointed change, unfretting, Sometimes I sit half regretting That she sighed. “IN THE NIGHT SHE CAME” I told her when I left one day That whatsoever weight of care Might strain our love, Time's mere assault Would work no changes there. And in the night she came to me, Toothless, and wan, and old, With leaden concaves round her eyes, And wrinkles manifold. I tremblingly exclaimed to her, “O wherefore do you ghost me thus! I have said that dull defacing Time Will bring no dreads to us.” “And is that true of you?” she cried In voice of troubled tune. I faltered: “Well . . . I did not think You would test me quite so soon!” She vanished with a curious smile, Which told me, plainlier than by word, That my staunch pledge could scarce beguile The fear she had averred. Her doubts then wrought their shape in me, And when next day I paid My due caress, we seemed to be Divided by some shade. THE CONFORMERS Yes; we'll wed, my little fay, And you shall write you mine, And in a villa chastely gray We'll house, and sleep, and dine. But those night-screened, divine, Stolen trysts of heretofore, We of choice ecstasies and fine Shall know no more. The formal faced cohue Will then no more upbraid With smiting smiles and whisperings two Who have thrown less loves in shade. We shall no more evade The searching light of the sun, Our game of passion will be played, Our dreaming done. We shall not go in stealth To rendezvous unknown, But friends will ask me of your health, And you about my own. When we abide alone, No leapings each to each, But syllables in frigid tone Of household speech. When down to dust we glide Men will not say askance, As now: “How all the country side Rings with their mad romance!” But as they graveward glance Remark: “In them we lose A worthy pair, who helped advance Sound parish views.” THE DAWN AFTER THE DANCE Here is your parents' dwelling with its curtained windows telling Of no thought of us within it or of our arrival here; Their slumbers have been normal after one day more of formal Matrimonial commonplace and household life's mechanic gear. I would be candid willingly, but dawn draws on so chillingly As to render further cheerlessness intolerable now, So I will not stand endeavouring to declare a day for severing, But will clasp you just as always—just the olden love avow. Through serene and surly weather we have walked the ways together, And this long night's dance this-year's end eve now finishes the spell; Yet we dreamt us but beginning a sweet sempiternal spinning Of a cord we have spun to breaking—too intemperately, too well. Yes; last night we danced I know, Dear, as we did that year ago, Dear, When a new strange bond between our days was formed, and felt, and heard; Would that dancing were the worst thing from the latest to the first thing That the faded year can charge us with; but what avails a word! That which makes man's love the lighter and the woman's burn no brighter Came to pass with us inevitably while slipped the shortening year. . . . And there stands your father's dwelling with its blind bleak windows telling That the vows of man and maid are frail as filmy gossamere. Weymouth, 1869. THE SUN ON THE LETTER I drew the letter out, while gleamed The sloping sun from under a roof Of cloud whose verge rose visibly. The burning ball flung rays that seemed Stretched like a warp without a woof Across the levels of the lea To where I stood, and where they beamed As brightly on the page of proof That she had shown her false to me As if it had shown her true—had teemed With passionate thought for my behoof Expressed with their own ardency! THE NIGHT OF THE DANCE The cold moon hangs to the sky by its horn, And centres its gaze on me; The stars, like eyes in reverie, Their westering as for a while forborne, Quiz downward curiously. Old Robert draws the backbrand in, The green logs steam and spit; The half-awakened sparrows flit From the riddled thatch; and owls begin To whoo from the gable-slit. Yes; far and nigh things seem to know Sweet scenes are impending here; That all is prepared; that the hour is near For welcomes, fellowships, and flow Of sally, song, and cheer; That spigots are pulled and viols strung; That soon will arise the sound Of measures trod to tunes renowned; That She will return in Love's low tongue My vows as we wheel around. MISCONCEPTION I busied myself to find a sure Snug hermitage That should preserve my Love secure From the world's rage; Where no unseemly saturnals, Or strident traffic-roars, Or hum of intervolved cabals Should echo at her doors. I laboured that the diurnal spin Of vanities Should not contrive to suck her in By dark degrees, And cunningly operate to blur Sweet teachings I had begun; And then I went full-heart to her To expound the glad deeds done. She looked at me, and said thereto With a pitying smile, “And this is what has busied you So long a while? O poor exhausted one, I see You have worn you old and thin For naught! Those moils you fear for me I find most pleasure in!” THE VOICE OF THE THORN I When the thorn on the down Quivers naked and cold, And the mid-aged and old Pace the path there to town, In these words dry and drear It seems to them sighing: “O winter is trying To sojourners here!” II When it stands fully tressed On a hot summer day, And the ewes there astray Find its shade a sweet rest, By the breath of the breeze It inquires of each farer: “Who would not be sharer Of shadow with these?” III But by day or by night, And in winter or summer, Should I be the comer Along that lone height, In its voicing to me Only one speech is spoken: “Here once was nigh broken A heart, and by thee.” FROM HER IN THE COUNTRY I thought and thought of thy crass clanging town To folly, till convinced such dreams were ill, I held my heart in bond, and tethered down Fancy to where I was, by force of will. I said: How beautiful are these flowers, this wood, One little bud is far more sweet to me Than all man's urban shows; and then I stood Urging new zest for bird, and bush, and tree; And strove to feel my nature brought it forth Of instinct, or no rural maid was I; But it was vain; for I could not see worth Enough around to charm a midge or fly, And mused again on city din and sin, Longing to madness I might move therein! 16 W. P. V., 1866. HER CONFESSION As some bland soul, to whom a debtor says “I'll now repay the amount I owe to you,” In inward gladness feigns forgetfulness That such a payment ever was his due (His long thought notwithstanding), so did I At our last meeting waive your proffered kiss With quick divergent talk of scenery nigh, By such suspension to enhance my bliss. And as his looks in consternation fall When, gathering that the debt is lightly deemed, The debtor makes as not to pay at all, So faltered I, when your intention seemed Converted by my false uneagerness To putting off for ever the caress. W. P. V., 1865–67. TO AN IMPERSONATOR OF ROSALIND Did he who drew her in the years ago— Till now conceived creator of her grace— With telescopic sight high natures know, Discern remote in Time's untravelled space Your soft sweet mien, your gestures, as do we, And with a copyist's hand but set them down, Glowing yet more to dream our ecstasy When his Original should be forthshown? For, kindled by that animated eye, Whereto all fairnesses about thee brim, And by thy tender tones, what wight can fly The wild conviction welling up in him That he at length beholds woo, parley, plead, The “very, very Rosalind” indeed! 8 Adelphi Terrace, 21st April 1867. TO AN ACTRESS I read your name when you were strange to me, Where it stood blazoned bold with many more; I passed it vacantly, and did not see Any great glory in the shape it wore. O cruelty, the insight barred me then! Why did I not possess me with its sound, And in its cadence catch and catch again Your nature's essence floating therearound? Could that man be this I, unknowing you, When now the knowing you is all of me, And the old world of then is now a new, And purpose no more what it used to be— A thing of formal journeywork, but due To springs that then were sealed up utterly? 1867. THE MINUTE BEFORE MEETING The grey gaunt days dividing us in twain Seemed hopeless hills my strength must faint to climb, But they are gone; and now I would detain The few clock-beats that part us; rein back Time, And live in close expectance never closed In change for far expectance closed at last, So harshly has expectance been imposed On my long need while these slow blank months passed. And knowing that what is now about to be Will all have been in O, so short a space! I read beyond it my despondency When more dividing months shall take its place, Thereby denying to this hour of grace A full-up measure of felicity. 1871. HE ABJURES LOVE At last I put off love, For twice ten years The daysman of my thought, And hope, and doing; Being ashamed thereof, And faint of fears And desolations, wrought In his pursuing, Since first in youthtime those Disquietings That heart-enslavement brings To hale and hoary, Became my housefellows, And, fool and blind, I turned from kith and kind To give him glory. I was as children be Who have no care; I did not shrink or sigh, I did not sicken; But lo, Love beckoned me, And I was bare, And poor, and starved, and dry, And fever-stricken. Too many times ablaze With fatuous fires, Enkindled by his wiles To new embraces, Did I, by wilful ways And baseless ires, Return the anxious smiles Of friendly faces. No more will now rate I The common rare, The midnight drizzle dew, The gray hour golden, The wind a yearning cry, The faulty fair, Things dreamt, of comelier hue Than things beholden! . . . —I speak as one who plumbs Life's dim profound, One who at length can sound Clear views and certain. But—after love what comes? A scene that lours, A few sad vacant hours, And then, the Curtain. 1883. A SET OF COUNTRY SONGS LET ME ENJOY I Let me enjoy the earth no less Because the all-enacting Might That fashioned forth its loveliness Had other aims than my delight. II About my path there flits a Fair, Who throws me not a word or sign; I'll charm me with her ignoring air, And laud the lips not meant for mine. III From manuscripts of moving song Inspired by scenes and dreams unknown I'll pour out raptures that belong To others, as they were my own. IV And some day hence, towards Paradise And all its blest—if such should be— I will lift glad, afar-off eyes, Though it contain no place for me. AT CASTERBRIDGE FAIR I The Ballad-Singer Sing, Ballad-singer, raise a hearty tune; Make me forget that there was ever a one I walked with in the meek light of the moon When the day's work was done. Rhyme, Ballad-rhymer, start a country song; Make me forget that she whom I loved well Swore she would love me dearly, love me long, Then—what I cannot tell! Sing, Ballad-singer, from your little book; Make me forget those heart-breaks, achings, fears; Make me forget her name, her sweet sweet look— Make me forget her tears. II Former Beauties These market-dames, mid-aged, with lips thin-drawn, And tissues sere, Are they the ones we loved in years agone, And courted here? Are these the muslined pink young things to whom We vowed and swore In nooks on summer Sundays by the Froom, Or Budmouth shore? Do they remember those gay tunes we trod Clasped on the green; Aye; trod till moonlight set on the beaten sod A satin sheen? They must forget, forget! They cannot know What once they were, Or memory would transfigure them, and show Them always fair. III After the Club-Dance Black'on frowns east on Maidon, And westward to the sea, But on neither is his frown laden With scorn, as his frown on me! At dawn my heart grew heavy, I could not sip the wine, I left the jocund bevy And that young man o'mine. The roadside elms pass by me,— Why do I sink with shame When the birds a-perch there eye me? They, too, have done the same! IV The Market-Girl Nobody took any notice of her as she stood on the causey kerb, All eager to sell her honey and apples and bunches of garden herb; And if she had offered to give her wares and herself with them too that day, I doubt if a soul would have cared to take a bargain so choice away. But chancing to trace her sunburnt grace that morning as I passed nigh, I went and I said “Poor maidy dear!—and will none of the people buy?” And so it began; and soon we knew what the end of it all must be, And I found that though no others had bid, a prize had been won by me. V The Inquiry And are ye one of Hermitage— Of Hermitage, by Ivel Road, And do ye know, in Hermitage A thatch-roofed house where sengreens grow? And does John Waywood live there still— He of the name that there abode When father hurdled on the hill Some fifteen years ago? Does he now speak o'Patty Beech, The Patty Beech he used to—see, Or ask at all if Patty Beech Is known or heard of out this way? —Ask ever if she's living yet, And where her present home may be, And how she bears life's fag and fret After so long a day? In years agone at Hermitage This faded face was counted fair, None fairer; and at Hermitage We swore to wed when he should thrive. But never a chance had he or I, And waiting made his wish outwear, And Time, that dooms man's love to die, Preserves a maid's alive. VI A Wife Waits Will's at the dance in the Club-room below, Where the tall liquor-cups foam; I on the pavement up here by the Bow, The old name for the curved corner by the cross-streets in the middle of Casterbridge. Wait, wait, to steady him home. Will and his partner are treading a tune, Loving companions they be; Willy, before we were married in June, Said he loved no one but me; Said he would let his old pleasures all go Ever to live with his Dear. Will's at the dance in the Club-room below, Shivering I wait for him here. VII After the Fair The singers are gone from the Cornmarket-place With their broadsheets of rhymes, The street rings no longer in treble and bass With their skits on the times, And the Cross, lately thronged, is a dim naked space That but echoes the stammering chimes. “The Chimes” will be listened for in vain here at midnight now, having been abolished some years ago. From Clock-corner steps, as each quarter ding-dongs, Away the folk roam By the “Hart” and Grey's Bridge into byways and “drongs,” Or across the ridged loam; The younger ones shrilling the lately heard songs, The old saying, “Would we were home.” The shy-seeming maiden so mute in the fair Now rattles and talks, And that one who looked the most swaggering there Grows sad as she walks, And she who seemed eaten by cankering care In statuesque sturdiness stalks. And midnight clears High Street of all but the ghosts Of its buried burghees, From the latest far back to those old Roman hosts Whose remains one yet sees, Who loved, laughed, and fought, hailed their friends, drank their toasts At their meeting-times here, just as these! 1902. THE DARK-EYED GENTLEMAN I I pitched my day's leazings “Leazings”, bundle of gleaned corn. in Crimmercrock Lane, To tie up my garter and jog on again, When a dear dark-eyed gentleman passed there and said, In a way that made all o'me colour rose-red, “What do I see— O pretty knee!” And he came and he tied up my garter for me. II 'Twixt sunset and moonrise it was, I can mind: Ah, 'tis easy to lose what we nevermore find!— Of the dear stranger's home, of his name, I knew nought, But I soon knew his nature and all that it brought. Then bitterly Sobbed I that he Should ever have tied up my garter for me! III Yet now I've beside me a fine lissom lad, And my slip's nigh forgot, and my days are not sad; My own dearest joy is he, comrade, and friend, He it is who safe-guards me, on him I depend; No sorrow brings he, And thankful I be That his daddy once tied up my garter for me! TO CARREY CLAVEL You turn your back, you turn your back, And never your face to me, Alone you take your homeward track, And scorn my company. What will you do when Charley's seen Dewbeating down this way? —You'll turn your back as now, you mean? Nay, Carrey Clavel, nay! You'll see none's looking; put your lip Up like a tulip, so; And he will coll you, bend, and sip: Yes, Carrey, yes; I know! THE ORPHANED OLD MAID I wanted to marry, but father said, “No— 'Tis weakness in women to give themselves so; If you care for your freedom you'll listen to me, Make a spouse in your pocket, and let the men be.” I spake on't again and again: father cried, “Why—if you go husbanding, where shall I bide? For never a home's for me elsewhere than here!” And I yielded; for father had ever been dear. But now father's gone, and I feel growing old, And I'm lonely and poor in this house on the wold, And my sweetheart that was found a partner elsewhere, And nobody flings me a thought or a care. THE SPRING CALL Down Wessex way, when spring's a-shine, The blackbird's “pret-ty de-urr!” In Wessex accents marked as mine Is heard afar and near. He flutes it strong, as if in song No R's of feebler tone Than his appear in “pretty dear,” Have blackbirds ever known. Yet they pipe “prattie deerh!” I glean, Beneath a Scottish sky, And “pehty de-aw!” amid the treen Of Middlesex or nigh. While some folk say—perhaps in play— Who know the Irish isle, 'Tis “purrity dare!” in treeland there When songsters would beguile. Well: I'll say what the listening birds Say, hearing “pret-ty de-urr!”— However strangers sound such words, That's how we sound them here. Yes, in this clime at pairing time, As soon as eyes can see her At dawn of day, the proper way To call is “pret-ty de-urr!” JULIE-JANE Sing; how 'a would sing! How 'a would raise the tune When we rode in the waggon from harvesting By the light o'the moon! Dance; how 'a would dance! If a fiddlestring did but sound She would hold out her coats, “Coats”, old name for petticoats. give a slanting glance, And go round and round. Laugh; how 'a would laugh! Her peony lips would part As if none such a place for a lover to quaff At the deeps of a heart. Julie, O girl of joy, Soon, soon that lover he came. Ah, yes; and gave thee a baby-boy, But never his name. . . . —Tolling for her, as you guess; And the baby too. . . . 'Tis well. You knew her in maidhood likewise?—Yes, That's her burial bell. “I suppose,” with a laugh, she said, “I should blush that I'm not a wife; But how can it matter, so soon to be dead, What one does in life!” When we sat making the mourning By her death-bed side, said she, “Dears, how can you keep from your lovers, adorning In honour of me!” Bubbling and brightsome eyed! But now—O never again. She chose her bearers before she died From her fancy-men. It is, or was, a common custom in Wessex, and probably other country places, to prepare the mourning beside the death-bed, the dying person sometimes assisting, who also selects his or her bearers on such occasions. NEWS FOR HER MOTHER I One mile more is Where your door is, Mother mine!— Harvest's coming, Mills are strumming, Apples fine, And the cider made to-year will be as wine. II Yet, not viewing What's a-doing Here around Is it thrills me, And so fills me That I bound Like a ball or leaf or lamb along the ground. III Tremble not now At your lot now, Silly soul! Hosts have sped them Quick to wed them, Great and small, Since the first two sighing half-hearts made a whole. IV Yet I wonder, Will it sunder Her from me? Will she guess that I said “Yes,”—that His I'd be, Ere I thought she might not see him as I see! V Old brown gable, Granary, stable, Here you are! O my mother, Can another Ever bar Mine from thy heart, make thy nearness seem afar? THE FIDDLER The fiddler knows what's brewing To the lilt of his lyric wiles: The fiddler knows what rueing Will come of this night's smiles! He sees couples join them for dancing, And afterwards joining for life, He sees them pay high for their prancing By a welter of wedded strife. He twangs: “Music hails from the devil, Though vaunted to come from heaven, For it makes people do at a revel What multiplies sins by seven. “There's many a heart now mangled, And waiting its time to go, Whose tendrils were first entangled By my sweet viol and bow!” THE HUSBAND'S VIEW “Can anything avail Beldame, for my hid grief?— Listen: I'll tell the tale, It may bring faint relief!— “I came where I was not known In hope to flee my sin; And walking forth alone A young man said, ‘Good e'en,’ “In gentle voice and true He asked to marry me; ‘You only—only you Fulfil my dream!’ said he. “We married o'Monday morn, In the month of hay and flowers; My cares were nigh forsworn, And perfect love was ours. “But ere the days are long Untimely fruit will show; My Love keeps up his song, Undreaming it is so. “And I awake in the night, And think of months gone by, And of that cause of flight Hidden from my Love's eye. “Discovery borders near, And then! . . . But something stirred?— My husband—he is here! Heaven—has he overheard?”— “Yes; I have heard, sweet Nan; I have known it all the time. I am not a particular man; Misfortunes are no crime: “And what with our serious need Of sons for soldiering, That accident, indeed, To maids, is a useful thing!” ROSE-ANN Why didn't you say you was promised, Rose-Ann? Why didn't you name it to me, Ere ever you tempted me hither, Rose-Ann, So often, so wearifully? O why did you let me be near 'ee, Rose-Ann, Talking things about wedlock so free, And never by nod or by whisper, Rose-Ann, Give a hint that it wasn't to be? Down home I was raising a flock of stock ewes, Cocks and hens, and wee chickens by scores, And lavendered linen all ready to use, A-dreaming that they would be yours. Mother said: “She's a sport-making maiden, my son”; And a pretty sharp quarrel had we; O why do you prove by this wrong you have done That I saw not what mother could see? Never once did you say you was promised, Rose-Ann, Never once did I dream it to be; And it cuts to the heart to be treated, Rose-Ann, As you in your scorning treat me! THE HOMECOMING Gruffly growled the wind on Toller downland broad and bare, And lonesome was the house, and dark; and few came there. “Now don't ye rub your eyes so red; we're home and have no cares; Here's a skimmer-cake for supper, peckled onions, and some pears; I've got a little keg o'summat strong, too, under stairs: —What, slight your husband's victuals? Other brides can tackle theirs!” The wind of winter mooed and mouthed their chimney like a horn, And round the house and past the house 'twas leafless and lorn. “But my dear and tender poppet, then, how came ye to agree In Ivel church this morning? Sure, there-right you married me!” —“Hoo-hoo!—I don't know—I forgot how strange and far 'twould be, An' I wish I was at home again with dear daddee!” Gruffly growled the wind on Toller downland broad and bare, And lonesome was the house and dark; and few came there. “I didn't think such furniture as this was all you'd own, And great black beams for ceiling, and a floor o'wretched stone, And nasty pewter platters, horrid forks of steel and bone, And a monstrous crock in chimney. 'Twas to me quite unbeknown!” Rattle rattle went the door; down flapped a cloud of smoke, As shifting north the wicked wind assayed a smarter stroke. “Now sit ye by the fire, poppet; put yourself at ease: And keep your little thumb out of your mouth, dear, please! And I'll sing to 'ee a pretty song of lovely flowers and bees, And happy lovers taking walks within a grove o'trees.” Gruffly growled the wind on Toller Down, so bleak and bare, And lonesome was the house, and dark; and few came there. “Now, don't ye gnaw your handkercher; 'twill hurt your little tongue, And if you do feel spitish, 'tis because ye are over young; But you'll be getting older, like us all, ere very long, And you'll see me as I am—a man who never did 'ee wrong.” Straight from Whit'sheet Hill to Benvill Lane the blusters pass, Hitting hedges, milestones, handposts, trees, and tufts of grass. “Well, had I only known, my dear, that this was how you'd be, I'd have married her of riper years that was so fond of me. But since I can't, I've half a mind to run away to sea, And leave 'ee to go barefoot to your d?d daddee!” Up one wall and down the other—past each window-pane— Prance the gusts, and then away down Crimmercrock's long lane. “I—I—don't know what to say to't, since your wife I've vowed to be; And as 'tis done, I s'pose here I must bide—poor me! Aye—as you are ki-ki-kind, I'll try to live along with 'ee, Although I'd fain have stayed at home with dear daddee!” Gruffly growled the wind on Toller Down, so bleak and bare, And lonesome was the house and dark; and few came there. “That's right, my Heart! And though on haunted Toller Down we be, And the wind swears things in chimley, we'll to supper merrily! So don't ye tap your shoe so pettish-like; but smile at me, And ye'll soon forget to sock and sigh for dear daddee!” December 1901. PIECES OCCASIONAL AND VARIOUS A CHURCH ROMANCE (Mellstock: circa 1835) She turned in the high pew, until her sight Swept the west gallery, and caught its row Of music-men with viol, book, and bow Against the sinking sad tower-window light. She turned again; and in her pride's despite One strenuous viol's inspirer seemed to throw A message from his string to her below, Which said: “I claim thee as my own forthright!” Thus their hearts' bond began, in due time signed. And long years thence, when Age had scared Romance, At some old attitude of his or glance That gallery-scene would break upon her mind, With him as minstrel, ardent, young, and trim, Bowing “New Sabbath” or “Mount Ephraim.” THE RASH BRIDE An Experience of the Mellstock Quire I We Christmas-carolled down the Vale, and up the Vale, and round the Vale, We played and sang that night as we were yearly wont to do— A carol in a minor key, a carol in the major D, Then at each house: “Good wishes: many Christmas joys to you!” II Next, to the widow's John and I and all the rest drew on. And I Discerned that John could hardly hold the tongue of him for joy. The widow was a sweet young thing whom John was bent on marrying, And quiring at her casement seemed romantic to the boy. III “She'll make reply, I trust,” said he, “to our salute? She must!” said he, “And then I will accost her gently—much to her surprise!— For knowing not I am with you here, when I speak up and call her dear A tenderness will fill her voice, a bashfulness her eyes.” IV So, by her window-square we stood; ay, with our lanterns there we stood, And he along with us,—not singing, waiting for a sign; And when we'd quired her carols three a light was lit and out looked she, A shawl about her bedgown, and her colour red as wine. V And sweetly then she bowed her thanks, and smiled, and spoke aloud her thanks; When lo, behind her back there, in the room, a man appeared. I knew him—one from Woolcomb way—Giles Swetman—honest as the day, But eager, hasty; and I felt that some strange trouble neared. VI “How comes he there? . . . Suppose,” said we, “she's wed of late! Who knows?” said we. —“She married yester-morning—only mother yet has known The secret o't!” shrilled one small boy. “But now I've told, let's wish 'em joy!” A heavy fall aroused us: John had gone down like a stone. VII We rushed to him and caught him round, and lifted him, and brought him round, When, hearing something wrong had happened, oped the window she: “Has one of you fallen ill?” she asked, “by these night labours overtasked?” None answered. That she'd done poor John a cruel turn felt we. VIII Till up spoke Michael: “Fie, young dame! You've broke your promise, sly young dame, By forming this new tie, young dame, and jilting John so true, Who trudged to-night to sing to 'ee because he thought he'd bring to 'ee Good wishes as your coming spouse. May ye such trifling rue!” IX Her man had said no word at all; but being behind had heard it all, And now cried: “Neighbours, on my soul I knew not 'twas like this!” And then to her: “If I had known you'd had in tow not me alone, No wife should you have been of mine. It is a dear bought bliss!” X She changed death-white, and heaved a cry: we'd never heard so grieved a cry As came from her at this from him: heartbroken quite seemed she; And suddenly, as we looked on, she turned, and rushed; and she was gone, Whither, her husband, following after, knew not; nor knew we. XI We searched till dawn about the house; within the house, without the house, We searched among the laurel boughs that grew beneath the wall, And then among the crocks and things, and stores for winter junketings, In linhay, loft, and dairy; but we found her not at all. XII Then John rushed in: “O friends,” he said, “hear this, this, this!” and bends his head: “I've—searched round by the—well, and find the cover open wide! I am fearful that—I can't say what . . . Bring lanterns, and some cords to knot.” We did so, and we went and stood the deep dark hole beside. XIII And then they, ropes in hand, and I—ay, John, and all the band, and I Let down a lantern to the depths—some hundred feet and more; It glimmered like a fog-dimmed star; and there, beside its light, afar, White drapery floated, and we knew the meaning that it bore. XIV The rest is naught. . . . We buried her o'Sunday. Neighbours carried her; And Swetman—he who'd married her—now miserablest of men, Walked mourning first; and then walked John; just quivering, but composed anon; And we the quire formed round the grave, as was the custom then. XV Our old bass player, as I recall—his white hair blown—but why recall!— His viol upstrapped, bent figure—doomed to follow her full soon— Stood bowing, pale and tremulous; and next to him the rest of us. . . . We sang the Ninetieth Psalm to her—set to Saint Stephen's tune. THE DEAD QUIRE I Beside the Mead of Memories, Where Church-way mounts to Moaning Hill, The sad man sighed his phantasies: He seems to sigh them still. II “'Twas the Birth-tide Eve, and the hamleteers Made merry with ancient Mellstock zest, But the Mellstock quire of former years Had entered into rest. III “Old Dewy lay by the gaunt yew tree, And Reuben and Michael a pace behind, And Bowman with his family By the wall that the ivies bind. IV “The singers had followed one by one, Treble, and tenor, and thorough-bass; And the worm that wasteth had begun To mine their mouldering place. V “For two-score years, ere Christ-day light, Mellstock had throbbed to strains from these; But now there echoed on the night No Christmas harmonies. VI “Three meadows off, at a dormered inn, The youth had gathered in high carouse, And, ranged on settles, some therein Had drunk them to a drowse. VII “Loud, lively, reckless, some had grown, Each dandling on his jigging knee Eliza, Dolly, Nance, or Joan— Livers in levity. VIII “The taper flames and hearthfire shine Grew smoke-hazed to a lurid light, And songs on subjects not divine Were warbled forth that night. IX “Yet many were sons and grandsons here Of those who, on such eves gone by, At that still hour had throated clear Their anthems to the sky. X “The clock belled midnight; and ere long One shouted, ‘Now 'tis Christmas morn; Here's to our women old and young, And to John Barleycorn!’ XI “They drink the toast and shout again: The pewter-ware rings back the boom, And for a breath-while follows then A silence in the room. XII “When nigh without, as in old days, The ancient quire of voice and string Seemed singing words of prayer and praise As they had used to sing: XIII “While shepherds watch'd their flocks by night,— Thus swells the long familiar sound In many a quaint symphonic flight— To, Glory shone around. XIV “The sons defined their fathers' tones, The widow his whom she had wed, And others in the minor moans The viols of the dead. XV “Something supernal has the sound As verse by verse the strain proceeds, And stilly staring on the ground Each roysterer holds and heeds. XVI “Towards its chorded closing bar Plaintively, thinly, waned the hymn, Yet lingered, like the notes afar Of banded seraphim. XVII “With brows abashed, and reverent tread, The hearkeners sought the tavern door: But nothing, save wan moonlight, spread The empty highway o'er. XVIII “While on their hearing fixed and tense The aerial music seemed to sink, As it were gently moving thence Along the river brink. XIX “Then did the Quick pursue the Dead By crystal Froom that crinkles there; And still the viewless quire ahead Voiced the old holy air. XX “By Bank-walk wicket, brightly bleached, It passed, and 'twixt the hedges twain, Dogged by the living; till it reached The bottom of Church Lane. XXI “There, at the turning, it was heard Drawing to where the churchyard lay: But when they followed thitherward It smalled, and died away. XXII “Each headstone of the quire, each mound, Confronted them beneath the moon; But no more floated therearound That ancient Birth-night tune. XXIII “There Dewy lay by the gaunt yew tree, There Reuben and Michael, a pace behind, And Bowman with his family By the wall that the ivies bind. . . . XXIV “As from a dream each sobered son Awoke, and musing reached his door: 'Twas said that of them all, not one Sat in a tavern more.” XXV —The sad man ceased; and ceased to heed His listener, and crossed the leaze From Moaning Hill towards the mead— The Mead of Memories. 1897. THE CHRISTENING Whose child is this they bring Into the aisle?— At so superb a thing The congregation smile And turn their heads awhile. Its eyes are blue and bright, Its cheeks like rose; Its simple robes unite Whitest of calicoes With lawn, and satin bows. A pride in the human race At this paragon Of mortals, lights each face While the old rite goes on; But ah, they are shocked anon. What girl is she who peeps From the gallery stair, Smiles palely, redly weeps, With feverish furtive air As though not fitly there? “I am the baby's mother; This gem of the race The decent fain would smother, And for my deep disgrace I am bidden to leave the place.” “Where is the baby's father?”— “In the woods afar. He says there is none he'd rather Meet under moon or star Than me, of all that are. “To clasp me in lovelike weather. Wish fixing when, He says: To be together At will, just now and then, Makes him the blest of men; “But chained and doomed for life To slovening As vulgar man and wife, He says, is another thing: Yea: sweet Love's sepulchring!” 1904. A DREAM QUESTION “It shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine.” Micah iii. 6. I asked the Lord: “Sire, is this true Which hosts of theologians hold, That when we creatures censure you For shaping griefs and ails untold (Deeming them punishments undue) You rage, as Moses wrote of old? When we exlaim: ‘Beneficent He is not, for he orders pain, Or, if so, not omnipotent: To a mere child the thing is plain!’ Those who profess to represent You, cry out: ‘Impious and profane!’” He: “Save me from my friends, who deem That I care what my creatures say! Mouth as you list: sneer, rail, blaspheme, O manikin, the livelong day, Not one grief-groan or pleasure-gleam Will you increase or take away. “Why things are thus, whoso derides, May well remain my secret still . . . . A fourth dimension, say the guides, To matter is conceivable. Think some such mystery resides Within the ethic of my will.” BY THE BARROWS Not far from Mellstock—so tradition saith— Where barrows, bulging as they bosoms were Of Multimammia stretched supinely there, Catch night and noon the tempest's wanton breath, A battle, desperate doubtless unto death, Was one time fought. The outlook, lone and bare, The towering hawk and passing raven share, And all the upland round is called “The He'th.” Here once a woman, in our modern age, Fought singlehandedly to shield a child— One not her own—from a man's senseless rage. And to my mind no patriots' bones there piled So consecrate the silence as her deed Of stoic and devoted self-unheed. A WIFE AND ANOTHER “War ends, and he's returning Early; yea, The evening next to-morrow's!”— —This I say To her, whom I suspiciously survey, Holding my husband's letter To her view.— She glanced at it but lightly, And I knew That one from him that day had reached her too. There was no time for scruple; Secretly I filched her missive, conned it, Learnt that he Would lodge with her ere he came home to me. To reach the port before her, And, unscanned, There wait to intercept them Soon I planned: That, in her stead, I might before him stand. So purposed, so effected; At the inn Assigned, I found her hidden:— O that sin Should bear what she bore when I entered in! Her heavy lids grew laden With despairs, Her lips made soundless movements Unawares, While I peered at the chamber hired as theirs. And as beside its doorway, Deadly hued, One inside, one withoutside We two stood, He came—my husband—as she knew he would. No pleasurable triumph Was that sight! The ghastly disappointment Broke them quite. What love was theirs, to move them with such might! “Madam, forgive me!” said she, Sorrow bent, “A child—I soon shall bear him. . . . Yes—I meant To tell you—that he won me ere he went.” Then, as it were, within me Something snapped, As if my soul had largened: Conscience-capped, I saw myself the snarer—them the trapped. “My hate dies, and I promise, Grace-beguiled,” I said, “to care for you, be Reconciled; And cherish, and take interest in the child.” Without more words I pressed him Through the door Within which she stood, powerless To say more, And closed it on them, and downstairward bore. “He joins his wife—my sister,” I, below, Remarked in going—lightly— Even as though All had come right, and we had arranged it so. . . As I, my road retracing, Left them free, The night alone embracing Childless me, I held I had not stirred God wrothfully. THE ROMAN ROAD The Roman Road runs straight and bare As the pale parting-line in hair Across the heath. And thoughtful men Contrast its days of Now and Then, And delve, and measure, and compare; Visioning on the vacant air Helmed legionaries, who proudly rear The Eagle, as they pace again The Roman Road. But no tall brass-helmed legionnaire Haunts it for me. Uprises there A mother's form upon my ken, Guiding my infant steps, as when We walked that ancient thoroughfare, The Roman Road. THE VAMPIRINE FAIR Gilbert had sailed to India's shore, And I was all alone: My lord came in at my open door And said, “O fairest one!” He leant upon the slant bureau, And sighed, “I am sick for thee!” “My Lord,” said I, “pray speak not so, Since wedded wife I be.” Leaning upon the slant bureau, Bitter his next words came: “So much I know; and likewise know My love burns on the same! “But since you thrust my love away, And since it knows no cure, I must live out as best I may The ache that I endure.” When Michaelmas browned the nether Coomb, And Wingreen Hill above, And made the hollyhocks rags of bloom, My lord grew ill of love. My lord grew ill with love for me; Gilbert was far from port; And—so it was—that time did see Me housed at Manor Court. About the bowers of Manor Court The primrose pushed its head When, on a day at last, report Arrived of him I had wed. “Gilbert, my Lord, is homeward bound, His sloop is drawing near, What shall I do when I am found Not in his house but here?” “O I will heal the injuries I've done to him and thee. I'll give him means to live at ease Afar from Shastonb'ry.” When Gilbert came we both took thought: “Since comfort and good cheer,” Said he, “so readily are bought, He's welcome to thee, Dear.” So when my lord flung liberally His gold in Gilbert's hands, I coaxed and got my brothers three Made stewards of his lands. And then I coaxed him to install My other kith and kin, With aim to benefit them all Before his love ran thin. And next I craved to be possessed Of plate and jewels rare. He groaned: “You give me, Love, no rest, Take all the law will spare!” And so in course of years my wealth Became a goodly hoard, My steward brethren, too, by stealth Had each a fortune stored. Thereafter in the gloom he'd walk, And by and by began To say aloud in absent talk, “I am a ruined man!— “I hardly could have thought,” he said, “When first I looked on thee, That one so soft, so rosy red, Could thus have beggared me!” Seeing his fair estates in pawn, And him in such decline, I knew that his domain had gone To lift up me and mine. Next month upon a Sunday morn A gunshot sounded nigh: By his own hand my lordly born Had doomed himself to die. “Live, my dear Lord, and much of thine Shall be restored to thee!” He smiled, and said 'twixt word and sign, “Alas—that cannot be!” And while I searched his cabinet For letters, keys, or will, 'Twas touching that his gaze was set With love upon me still. And when I burnt each document Before his dying eyes, 'Twas sweet that he did not resent My fear of compromise. The steeple-cock gleamed golden when I watched his spirit go: And I became repentant then That I had wrecked him so. Three weeks at least had come and gone, With many a saddened word, Before I wrote to Gilbert on The stroke that so had stirred. And having worn a mournful gown, I joined, in decent while, My husband at a dashing town To live in dashing style. Yet though I now enjoy my fling, And dine and dance and drive, I'd give my prettiest emerald ring To see my lord alive. And when the meet on hunting-days Is near his churchyard home, I leave my bantering beaux to place A flower upon his tomb; And sometimes say: “Perhaps too late The saints in Heaven deplore That tender time when, moved by Fate, He darked my cottage door.” THE REMINDER While I watch the Christmas blaze Paint the room with ruddy rays, Something makes my vision glide To the frosty scene outside. There, to reach a rotting berry, Toils a thrush,—constrained to very Dregs of food by sharp distress, Taking such with thankfulness. Why, O starving bird, when I One day's joy would justify, And put misery out of view, Do you make me notice you! THE RAMBLER I do not see the hills around, Nor mark the tints the copses wear; I do not note the grassy ground And constellated daisies there. I hear not the contralto note Of cuckoos hid on either hand, The whirr that shakes the nighthawk's throat When eve's brown awning hoods the land. Some say each songster, tree, and mead— All eloquent of love divine— Receives their constant careful heed: Such keen appraisement is not mine. The tones around me that I hear, The aspects, meanings, shapes I see, Are those far back ones missed when near, And now perceived too late by me! NIGHT IN THE OLD HOME When the wasting embers redden the chimney-breast, And Life's bare pathway looms like a desert track to me, And from hall and parlour the living have gone to their rest, My perished people who housed them here come back to me. They come and seat them around in their mouldy places, Now and then bending towards me a glance of wistfulness, A strange upbraiding smile upon all their faces, And in the bearing of each a passive tristfulness. “Do you uphold me, lingering and languishing here, A pale late plant of your once strong stock?” I say to them; “A thinker of crooked thoughts upon Life in the sere, And on That which consigns men to night after showing the day to them?” “—O let be the Wherefore! We fevered our years not thus: Take of Life what it grants, without question!” they answer me seemingly. “Enjoy, suffer, wait: spread the table here freely like us, And, satisfied, placid, unfretting, watch Time away beamingly!” AFTER THE LAST BREATH (J. H. 1813–1904) There's no more to be done, or feared, or hoped; None now need watch, speak low, and list, and tire; No irksome crease outsmoothed, no pillow sloped Does she require. Blankly we gaze. We are free to go or stay; Our morrow's anxious plans have missed their aim; Whether we leave to-night or wait till day Counts as the same. The lettered vessels of medicaments Seem asking wherefore we have set them here; Each palliative its silly face presents As useless gear. And yet we feel that something savours well; We note a numb relief withheld before; Our well-beloved is prisoner in the cell Of Time no more. We see by littles now the deft achievement Whereby she has escaped the Wrongers all, In view of which our momentary bereavement Outshapes but small. 1904. IN CHILDBED In the middle of the night Mother's spirit came and spoke to me, Looking weariful and white— As 'twere untimely news she broke to me. “O my daughter, joyed are you To own the weetless child you mother there; ‘Men may search the wide world through, You think, ‘nor find so fair another there!’ “Dear, this midnight time unwombs Thousands just as rare and beautiful; Thousands whom High Heaven foredooms To be as bright, as good, as dutiful. “Source of ecstatic hopes and fears And innocent maternal vanity, Your fond exploit but shapes for tears New thoroughfares in sad humanity. “Yet as you dream, so dreamt I When Life stretched forth its morning ray to me; Other views for by and by!” . . . . Such strange things did mother say to me. THE PINE PLANTERS (Marty South's Reverie) I We work here together In blast and breeze; He fills the earth in, I hold the trees. He does not notice That what I do Keeps me from moving And chills me through. He has seen one fairer I feel by his eye, Which skims me as though I were not by. And since she passed here He scarce has known But that the woodland Holds him alone. I have worked here with him Since morning shine, He busy with his thoughts And I with mine. I have helped him so many, So many days, But never win any Small word of praise! Shall I not sigh to him That I work on Glad to be nigh to him Though hope is gone? Nay, though he never Knew love like mine, I'll bear it ever And make no sign! II From the bundle at hand here I take each tree, And set it to stand, here Always to be; When, in a second, As if from fear Of Life unreckoned Beginning here, It starts a sighing Through day and night, Though while there lying 'Twas voiceless quite. It will sigh in the morning, Will sigh at noon, At the winter's warning, In wafts of June; Grieving that never Kind Fate decreed It should for ever Remain a seed, And shun the welter Of things without, Unneeding shelter From storm and drought. Thus, all unknowing For whom or what We set it growing In this bleak spot, It still will grieve here Throughout its time, Unable to leave here, Or change its clime; Or tell the story Of us to-day When, halt and hoary, We pass away. THE DEAR I plodded to Fairmile Hill-top, where A maiden one fain would guard From every hazard and every care Advanced on the roadside sward. I wondered how succeeding suns Would shape her wayfarings, And wished some Power might take such ones Under Its warding wings. The busy breeze came up the hill And smartened her cheek to red, And frizzled her hair to a haze. With a will “Good-morning, my Dear!” I said. She glanced from me to the far-off gray, And, with proud severity, “Good-morning to you—though I may say I am not your Dear,” quoth she: “For I am the Dear of one not here— One far from his native land!”— And she passed me by; and I did not try To make her understand. 1901. ONE WE KNEW (M. H. 1772–1857) She told how they used to form for the country dances— “The Triumph,” “The New-rigged Ship”— To the light of the guttering wax in the panelled manses, And in cots to the blink of a dip. She spoke of the wild “poussetting” and “allemanding” On carpet, on oak, and on sod; And the two long rows of ladies and gentlemen standing, And the figures the couples trod. She showed us the spot where the maypole was yearly planted, And where the bandsmen stood While breeched and kerchiefed partners whirled, and panted To choose each other for good. She told of that far-back day when they iearnt astounded Of the death of the King of France: Of the Terror; and then of Bonaparte's unbounded Ambition and arrogance. Of how his threats woke warlike preparations Along the southern strand, And how each night brought tremors and trepidations Lest morning should see him land. She said she had often heard the gibbet creaking As it swayed in the lightning flash, Had caught from the neighbouring town a small child's shrieking At the cart-tail under the lash. . . . With cap-framed face and long gaze into the embers— We seated around her knees— She would dwell on such dead themes, not as one who remembers, But rather as one who sees. She seemed one left behind of a band gone distant So far that no tongue could hail: Past things retold were to her as things existent, Things present but as a tale. May 20, 1902. SHE HEARS THE STORM There was a time in former years— While my roof-tree was his— When I should have been distressed by fears At such a night as this! I should have murmured anxiously, “The pricking rain strikes cold; His road is bare of hedge or tree, And he is getting old.” But now the fitful chimney-roar, The drone of Thorncombe trees, The Froom in flood upon the moor, The mud of Mellstock Leaze, The candle slanting sooty wick'd, The thuds upon the thatch, The eaves-drops on the window flicked, The clacking garden-hatch, And what they mean to wayfarers, I scarcely heed or mind; He has won that storm-tight roof of hers Which Earth grants all her kind. A WET NIGHT I pace along, the rain-shafts riddling me, Mile after mile out by the moorland way, And up the hill, and through the ewe-leaze gray Into the lane, and round the corner tree; Where, as my clothing clams me, mire-bestarred, And the enfeebled light dies out of day, Leaving the liquid shades to reign, I say, “This is a hardship to be calendared!” Yet sires of mine now perished and forgot, When worse beset, ere roads were shapen here, And night and storm were foes indeed to fear, Times numberless have trudged across this spot In sturdy muteness on their strenuous lot, And taking all such toils as trifles mere. BEFORE LIFE AND AFTER A time there was—as one may guess And as, indeed, earth's testimonies tell— Before the birth of consciousness, When all went well. None suffered sickness, love, or loss, None knew regret, starved hope, or heart-burnings; None cared whatever crash or cross Brought wrack to things. If something ceased, no tongue bewailed, If something winced and waned, no heart was wrung; If brightness dimmed, and dark prevailed, No sense was stung. But the disease of feeling germed, And primal rightness took the tinct of wrong; Ere nescience shall be reaffirmed How long, how long? NEW YEAR'S EVE “I have finished another year,” said God, “In grey, green, white, and brown; I have strewn the leaf upon the sod, Sealed up the worm within the clod, And let the last sun down.” “And what's the good of it?” I said, “What reasons made you call From formless void this earth we tread, When nine-and-ninety can be read Why nought should be at all? “Yea, Sire; why shaped you us, ‘who in This tabernacle groan’— If ever a joy be found herein, Such joy no man had wished to win If he had never known!” Then he: “My labours—logicless— You may explain; not I: Sense-sealed I have wrought, without a guess That I evolved a Consciousness To ask for reasons why. “Strange that ephemeral creatures who By my own ordering are, Should see the shortness of my view, Use ethic tests I never knew, Or made provision for!” He sank to raptness as of yore, And opening New Year's Day Wove it by rote as theretofore, And went on working evermore In his unweeting way. 1906. GOD'S EDUCATION I saw him steal the light away That haunted in her eye: It went so gently none could say More than that it was there one day And missing by-and-by. I watched her longer, and he stole Her lily tincts and rose; All her young sprightliness of soul Next fell beneath his cold control, And disappeared like those. I asked: “Why do you serve her so? Do you, for some glad day, Hoard these her sweets—?” He said, “O no, They charm not me; I bid Time throw Them carelessly away.” Said I: “We call that cruelty— We, your poor mortal kind.” He mused. “The thought is new to me. Forsooth, though I men's master be. Theirs is the teaching mind!” TO SINCERITY O sweet sincerity!— Where modern methods be What scope for thine and thee? Life may be sad past saying, Its greens for ever graying, Its faiths to dust decaying; And youth may have foreknown it, And riper seasons shown it, But custom cries: “Disown it: “Say ye rejoice, though grieving, Believe, while unbelieving, Behold, without perceiving!” —Yet, would men look at true things, And unilluded view things, And count to bear undue things, The real might mend the seeming, Facts better their foredeeming, And Life its disesteeming. February 1899. PANTHERA (For other forms of this legend—first met with in the second century—see Origen contra Celsum; the Talmud; Sepher Toldoth Jeschu; quoted fragments of lost Apocryphal gospels; Strauss, Haeckel; etc.) Yea, as I sit here, crutched, and cricked, and bent, I think of Panthera, who underwent Much from insidious aches in his decline; But his aches were not radical like mine; They were the twinges of old wounds—the feel Of the hand he had lost, shorn by barbarian steel, Which came back, so he said, at a change in the air, Fingers and all, as if it still were there. My pains are otherwise: upclosing cramps And stiffened tendons from this country's damps, Where Panthera was never commandant.— The Fates sent him by way of the Levant. He had been blithe in his young manhood's time, And as centurion carried well his prime. In Ethiop, Araby, climes fair and fell, He had seen service and had borne him well. Nought shook him then: he was serene as brave; Yet later knew some shocks, and would grow grave When pondering them; shocks less of corporal kind Than phantom-like, that disarranged his mind; And it was in the way of warning me (By much his junior) against levity That he recounted them; and one in chief Panthera loved to set in bold relief. This was a tragedy of his Eastern days, Personal in touch—though I have sometimes thought That touch a possible delusion—wrought Of half-conviction carried to a craze— His mind at last being stressed by ails and age:— Yet his good faith thereon I well could wage. I had said it long had been a wish with me That I might leave a scion—some small tree As channel for my sap, if not my name— Ay, offspring even of no legitimate claim, In whose advance I secretly could joy. Thereat he warmed. “Cancel such wishes, boy! A son may be a comfort or a curse, A seer, a doer, a coward, a fool; yea, worse— A criminal. . . . That I could testify!” . . . “Panthera has no guilty son!” cried I All unbelieving. “Friend, you do not know,” He darkly dropt: “True, I've none now to show, For the law took him. Ay, in sooth, Jove shaped it so!” “This noon is not unlike,” he again began, “The noon these pricking memories print on me— Yea, that day, when the sun grew copper-red, And I served in Judæa . . . 'Twas a date Of rest for arms. The Pax Romana ruled, To the chagrin of frontier legionaries! Palestine was annexed—though sullen yet,— I, being in age some two-score years and ten, And having the garrison in Jerusalem Part in my hands as acting officer Under the Governor. A tedious time I found it, of routine, amid a folk Restless, contentless, and irascible.— Quelling some riot, sentrying court and hall, Sending men forth on public meeting-days To maintain order, were my duties there. “Then came a morn in spring, and the cheerful sun Whitened the city and the hills around, And every mountain-road that clambered them, Tincturing the greyness of the olives warm, And the rank cacti round the valley's sides. The day was one whereon death-penalties Were put in force, and here and there were set The soldiery for order, as I said, Since one of the condemned had raised some heat, And crowds surged passionately to see him slain. I, mounted on a Cappadocian horse, With some half-company of auxiliaries, Had captained the procession through the streets When it came streaming from the judgment-hall After the verdicts of the Governor. It drew to the great gate of the northern way That bears towards Damascus; and to a knoll Upon the common, just beyond the walls— Whence could be swept a wide horizon round Over the housetops to the remotest heights. Here was the public execution-ground For city crimes, called then and doubtless now Golgotha, Kranion, or Calvaria. “The usual dooms were duly meted out; Some three or four were stript, transfixed, and nailed, And no great stir occurred. A day of wont It was to me, so far, and would have slid Clean from my memory at its squalid close But for an incident that followed these. “Among the tag-rag rabble of either sex That hung around the wretches as they writhed, Till thrust back by our spears, one held my eye— A weeping woman, whose strained countenance, Sharpened against a looming livid cloud, Was mocked by the crude rays of afternoon— The mother of one of those who suffered there I had heard her called when spoken roughly to By my ranged men for pressing forward so. It stole upon me hers was a face I knew; Yet when, or how, I had known it, for a while Eluded me. And then at once it came. “Some thirty years or more before that noon I was sub-captain of a company Drawn from the legion of Calabria, That marched up from Judæa north to Tyre. We had pierced the old flat country of Jezreel, The great Esdraelon Plain and fighting-floor Of Jew with Canaanite, and with the host Of Pharaoh-Necho, king of Egypt, met While crossing there to strike the Assyrian pride. We left behind Gilboa; passed by Nain; Till bulging Tabor rose, embossed to the top With arbute, terebinth, and locust growths. “Encumbering me were sundry sick, so fallen Through drinking from a swamp beside the way; But we pressed on, till, bearing over a ridge, We dipt into a world of pleasantness— A vale, the fairest I had gazed upon— Which lapped a village on its furthest slopes Called Nazareth, brimmed round by uplands nigh. In the midst thereof a fountain bubbled, where, Lime-dry from marching, our glad halt we made To rest our sick ones, and refresh us all. “Here a day onward, towards the eventide, Our men were piping to a Pyrrhic dance Trod by their comrades, when the young women came To fill their pitchers, as their custom was. I proffered help to one—a slim girl, coy Even as a fawn, meek, and as innocent. Her long blue gown, the string of silver coins That hung down by her banded beautiful hair, Symboled in full immaculate modesty. “Well, I was young, and hot, and readily stirred To quick desire. 'Twas tedious timing out The convalescence of the soldiery; And I beguiled the long and empty days By blissful yieldance to her sweet allure, Who had no arts, but what out-arted all, The tremulous tender charm of trustfulness. We met, and met, and under the winking stars That passed which peoples earth—true union, yea, To the pure eye of her simplicity. “Meanwhile the sick found health; and we pricked on I made her no rash promise of return, As some do use; I was sincere in that; I said we sundered never to meet again— And yet I spoke untruth unknowingly!— For meet again we did. Now, guess you aught? The weeping mother on Calvaria Was she I had known—albeit that time and tears Had wasted rudely her once flowerlike form, And her soft eyes, now swollen with sorrowing. “Though I betrayed some qualms, she marked me not; And I was scarce of mood to comrade her And close the silence of so wide a time To claim a malefactor as my son— (For so I guessed him). And inquiry made Brought rumour how at Nazareth long before An old man wedded her for pity's sake On finding she had grown pregnant, none knew how, Cared for her child, and loved her till he died. “Well; there it ended; save that then I learnt That he—the man whose ardent blood was mine— Had waked sedition long among the Jews, And hurled insulting parlance at their god, Whose temple bulked upon the adjoining hill, Vowing that he would raze it, that himself Was god as great as he whom they adored, And by descent, moreover, was their king; With sundry other incitements to misrule. “The impalements done, and done the soldiers' game Of raffling for the clothes, a legionary, Longinus, pierced the young man with his lance At signs from me, moved by his agonies Through naysaying the drug they had offered him. It brought the end. And when he had breathed his last The woman went. I saw her never again. . . . Now glares my moody meaning on you, friend?— That when you talk of offspring as sheer joy So trustingly, you blink contingencies. Fors Fortuna! He who goes fathering Gives frightful hostages to hazardry!” Thus Panthera's tale. 'Twas one he seldom told, But yet it got abroad. He would unfold, At other times, a story of less gloom, Though his was not a heart where jests had room. He would regret discovery of the truth Was made too late to influence to ruth The Procurator who had condemned his son— Or rather him so deemed. For there was none To prove that Panthera erred not: and indeed, When vagueness of identity I would plead, Panther himself would sometimes own as much— Yet lothly. But, assuming fact was such, That the said woman did not recognize Her lover's face, is matter for surprise. However, there's his tale, fantasy or otherwise. Thereafter shone not men of Panthera's kind: The indolent heads at home were ill-inclined To press campaigning that would hoist the star Of their lieutenants valorous afar. Jealousies kept him irked abroad, controlled And stinted by an Empire no more bold. Yet in some actions southward he had share— In Mauretania and Numidia; there With eagle eye, and sword and steed and spur, Quelling uprisings promptly. Some small stir In Parthia next engaged him, until maimed, As I have said; and cynic Time proclaimed His noble spirit broken. What a waste Of such a Roman!—one in youth-time graced With indescribable charm, so I have heard, Yea, magnetism impossible to word When faltering as I saw him. What a fame, O Son of Saturn, had adorned his name, Might the Three so have urged Thee!—Hour by hour His own disorders hampered Panthera's power To brood upon the fate of those he had known, Even of that one he always called his own— Either in morbid dream or memory. . . . He died at no great age, untroublously, An exit rare for ardent soldiers such as he. THE UNBORN I rose at night, and visited The Cave of the Unborn: And crowding shapes surrounded me For tidings of the life to be, Who long had prayed the silent Head To haste its advent morn. Their eyes were lit with artless trust, Hope thrilled their every tone: “A scene the loveliest, is it not? A pure delight, a beauty-spot Where all is gentle, true and just, And darkness is unknown?” My heart was anguished for their sake, I could not frame a word; And they descried my sunken face, And seemed to read therein, and trace The news that pity would not break, Nor truth leave unaverred. And as I silently retired I turned and watched them still, And they came helter-skelter out, Driven forward like a rabble rout Into the world they had so desired, By the all-immanent Will. 1905. THE MAN HE KILLED “Had he and I but met By some old ancient inn, We should have sat us down to wet Right many a nipperkin! “But ranged as infantry, And staring face to face, I shot at him as he at me, And killed him in his place. “I shot him dead because— Because he was my foe, Just so: my foe of course he was; That's clear enough; although “He thought he'd 'list, perhaps, Off-hand like—just as I— Was out of work—had sold his traps— No other reason why. “Yes; quaint and curious war is! You shoot a fellow down You'd treat if met where any bar is, Or help to half-a-crown.” 1902. GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE (A Memory of Christiana C?) Where Blackmoor was, the road that led To Bath, she could not show, Nor point the sky that overspread Towns ten miles off or so. But that Calcutta stood this way, Cape Horn there figured fell, That here was Boston, here Bombay, She could declare full well. Less known to her the track athwart Froom Mead or Yell'ham Wood Than how to make some Austral port In seas of surly mood. She saw the glint of Guinea's shore Behind the plum-tree nigh, Heard old unruly Biscay's roar In the weir's purl hard by. . . . “My son's a sailor, and he knows All seas and many lands, And when he's home he points and shows Each country where it stands. “He's now just there—by Gib's high rock— And when he gets, you see, To Portsmouth here, behind the clock, Then he'll come back to me!” ONE RALPH BLOSSOM SOLILOQUIZES (“It being deposed that vij women who were mayds before he knew them have been brought upon the towne [rates?] by the fornicacions of one Ralph Blossom, Mr. Maior inquired why he should not contribute xiv pence weekly toward their mayntenance. But it being shewn that the sayd R. B. was dying of a purple feaver, no order was made.” —Budmouth Borough Minutes: 16??.) When I am in hell or some such place, A-groaning over my sorry case, What will those seven women say to me Who, when I coaxed them, answered “Aye” to me? “I did not understand your sign!” Will be the words of Caroline; While Jane will cry, “If I'd had proof of you, I should have learnt to hold aloof of you!” “I won't reproach: it was to be!” Will dryly murmur Cicely; And Rosa: “I feel no hostility, For I must own I lent facility.” Lizzy says: “Sharp was my regret, And sometimes it is now! But yet I joy that, though it brought notoriousness, I knew Love once and all its gloriousness!” Says Patience: “Why are we apart? Small harm did you, my poor Sweet Heart! A manchild born, now tall and beautiful, Was worth the ache of days undutiful.” And Anne cries: “O the time was fair, So wherefore should you burn down there? There is a deed under the sun, my Love, And that was ours. What's done is done, my Love. These trumpets here in Heaven are dumb to me With you away. Dear, come, O come to me!” THE NOBLE LADY'S TALE (circa 1790) I “We moved with pensive paces, I and he, And bent our faded faces Wistfully, For something troubled him, and troubled me. “The lanthorn feebly lightened Our grey hall, Where ancient brands had brightened Hearth and wall, And shapes long vanished whither vanish all. “‘O why, Love, nightly, daily, I had said, ‘Dost sigh, and smile so palely, As if shed Were all Life's blossoms, all its dear things dead?’ “‘Since silence sets thee grieving,’ He replied, ‘And I abhor deceiving One so tried, Why, Love, I'll speak, ere time us twain divide. “He held me, I remember, Just as when Our life was June—(September It was then); And we walked on, until he spoke again: “‘Susie, an Irish mummer, Loud-acclaimed Through the gay London summer, Was I; named A master in my art, who would be famed. “‘But lo, there beamed before me Lady Su; God's altar-vow she swore me When none knew, And for her sake I bade the sock adieu. “‘My Lord your father's pardon Thus I won: He let his heart unharden Towards his son, And honourably condoned what we had done; “‘But said—recall you, dearest?— As for Su, I'd see her—ay, though nearest Me unto— Sooner entombed than in a stage purlieu! “‘Just so.—And here he housed us, In this nook, Where Love like balm has drowsed us: Robin, rook, Our chief familiars, next to string and book. “‘Our days here, peace-enshrouded, Followed strange The old stage-joyance, crowded, Rich in range; But never did my soul desire a change, “‘Till now, when far uncertain Lips of yore Call, call me to the curtain, There once more, But once, to tread the boards I trod before. “‘A night—the last and single Ere I die— To face the lights, to mingle As did I Once in the game, and rivet every eye!’ “Such was his wish. He feared it, Feared it though Rare memories so endeared it. I, also, Feared it still more; its outcome who could know? “‘Alas, my Love,’ said I then, ‘Since it be A wish so mastering, why, then, E'en go ye!— Despite your pledge to father and to me . . .’ “'Twas fixed; no more was spoken Thereupon; Our silences were broken Only on The petty items of his needs while gone. “Farewell he bade me, pleading That it meant So little, thus conceding To his bent; And then, as one constrained to go, he went. “Thwart thoughts I let deride me, As, 'twere vain To hope him back beside me Ever again: Could one plunge make a waxing passion wane? “I thought, ‘Some wild stage-woman, Honour-wrecked . . .’ But no: it was inhuman To suspect; Though little cheer could my lone heart affect! II “Yet came it, to my gladness, That, as vowed, He did return.—But sadness Swiftly cowed The joy with which my greeting was endowed. “Some woe was there. Estrangement Marked his mind. Each welcome-warm arrangement I had designed Touched him no more than deeds of careless kind. “‘I—failed!’ escaped him glumly. ‘—I went on In my old part. But dumbly— Memory gone— Advancing, I sank sick; my vision drawn “‘To something drear, distressing As the knell Of all hopes worth possessing!’ . . . —What befell Seemed linked with me, but how I could not tell. “Hours passed; till I implored him, As he knew How faith and frankness toward him Ruled me through, To say what ill I had done, and could undo. “‘Faith—frankness. Ah! Heaven save such!’ Murmured he, ‘They are wedded wealth! I gave such Liberally, But you, Dear, not. For you suspected me.’ “I was about beseeching In hurt haste More meaning, when he, reaching To my waist, Led me to pace the hall as once we paced. “‘I never meant to draw you To own all,’ Declared he, ‘But—I saw you— By the wall, Half-hid. And that was why I failed withal!’ “‘Where? when?’ said I—‘Why, nigh me, At the play That night. That you should spy me, Doubt my fay, And follow, furtive, took my heart away!’ “That I had never been there, But had gone To my locked room—unseen there, Curtains drawn, Long days abiding—told I, wonder-wan. “‘Nay, 'twas your form and vesture, Cloak and gown, Your hooded features—gesture Half in frown, That faced me, pale,’ he urged, ‘that night in town. “‘And when, outside, I handed To her chair (As courtesy demanded Of me there) The leading lady, you peeped from the stair.’ “Straight pleaded I: ‘Forsooth, Love, Had I gone, I must have been in truth, Love, Mad to don Such well-known raiment.’ But he still went on “That he was not mistaken Nor misled.— I felt like one forsaken, Wished me dead, That he could think thus of the wife he had wed! “His going seemed to waste him Like a curse, To wreck what once had graced him; And, averse To my approach, he mused, and moped, and worse. “Till, what no words effected Thought achieved: It was my wraith—projected, He conceived, Thither, by my tense brain at home aggrieved. “Thereon his credence centred Till he died; And, no more tempted, entered Sanctified, The little vault with room for one beside.” III Thus far the lady's story.— Now she, too, Reclines within that hoary Last dark mew In Mellstock Quire with him she loved so true A yellowing marble, placed there Tablet-wise, And two joined hearts enchased there Meet the eyes; And reading their twin names we moralize: Did she, we wonder, follow Jealously? And were those protests hollow?— Or saw he Some semblant dame? Or can wraiths really be? Were it she went, her honour, All may hold, Pressed truth at last upon her Till she told— (Him only—others as these lines unfold.) Riddle death-sealed for ever, Let it rest! . . . One's heart could blame her never If one guessed That go she did. She knew her actor best. UNREALIZED Down comes the winter rain— Spoils my hat and bow— Runs into the poll of me; But mother won't know. We've been out and caught a cold, Knee-deep in snow; Such a lucky thing it is That mother won't know! Rosy lost herself last night— Couldn't tell where to go. Yes—it rather frightened her, But mother didn't know. Somebody made Willy drunk At the Christmas show: O 'twas fun! It's well for him That mother won't know! Howsoever wild we are, Late at school or slow, Mother won't be cross with us Mother won't know. How we cried the day she died! Neighbours whispering low . . . But we now do what we will— Mother won't know. WAGTAIL AND BABY A baby watched a ford, whereto A wagtail came for drinking; A blaring bull went wading through, The wagtail showed no shrinking. A stallion splashed his way across, The birdie nearly sinking; He gave his plumes a twitch and toss, And held his own unblinking. Next saw the baby round the spot A mongrel slowly slinking; The wagtail gazed, but faltered not In dip and sip and prinking. A perfect gentleman then neared; The wagtail, in a winking, With terror rose and disappeared; The baby fell a-thinking. ABERDEEN (April: 1905) “And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times.” —Isaiah xxxiii. 6. I looked and thought, “All is too gray and cold To wake my place-enthusiasms of old!” Till a voice passed: “Behind that granite mien Lurks the imposing beauty of a Queen.” I looked anew; and saw the radiant form Of Her who soothes in stress, who steers in storm, On the grave influence of whose eyes sublime Men count for the stability of the time. GEORGE MEREDITH (1828–1909) Forty years back, when much had place That since has perished out of mind, I heard that voice and saw that face. He spoke as one afoot will wind A morning horn ere men awake; His note was trenchant, turning kind. He was of those whose wit can shake And riddle to the very core The counterfeits that Time will break. . . Of late, when we two met once more, The luminous countenance and rare Shone just as forty years before. So that, when now all tongues declare His shape unseen by his green hill, I scarce believe he sits not there. No matter. Further and further still Through the world's vaporous vitiate air His words wing on—as live words will. May 1909. YELL'HAM-WOOD'S STORY Coomb-Firtrees say that Life is a moan, And Clyffe-hill Clump says “Yea!” But Yell'ham says a thing of its own: It's not “Gray, gray Is Life alway!” That Yell'ham says, Nor that Life is for ends unknown. It says that Life would signify A thwarted purposing: That we come to live, and are called to die. Yes, that's the thing In fall, in spring, That Yell'ham says:— “Life offers—to deny!” 1902.

      <field name="fulltext">SATIRES OF CIRCUMSTANCE LYRICS AND REVERIES LYRICS AND REVERIES IN FRONT OF THE LANDSCAPE Plunging and labouring on in a tide of visions, Dolorous and dear, Forward I pushed my way as amid waste waters Stretching around, Through whose eddies there glimmered the customed landscape Yonder and near Blotted to feeble mist. And the coomb and the upland Coppice-crowned, Ancient chalk-pit, milestone, rills in the grass-flat Stroked by the light, Seemed but a ghost-like gauze, and no substantial Meadow or mound. What were the infinite spectacles featuring foremost Under my sight, Hindering me to discern my paced advancement Lengthening to miles; What were the re-creations killing the daytime As by the night? O they were speechful faces, gazing insistent, Some as with smiles, Some as with slow-born tears that brinily trundled Over the wrecked Cheeks that were fair in their flush-time, ash now with anguish, Harrowed by wiles. Yes, I could see them, feel them, hear them, address them— Halo-bedecked— And, alas, onwards, shaken by fierce unreason, Rigid in hate, Smitten by years-long wryness born of misprision, Dreaded, suspect. Then there would breast me shining sights, sweet seasons Further in date; Instruments of strings with the tenderest passion Vibrant, beside Lamps long extinguished, robes, cheeks, eyes with the earth's crust Now corporate. Also there rose a headland of hoary aspect Gnawed by the tide, Frilled by the nimb of the morning as two friends stood there Guilelessly glad— Wherefore they knew not—touched by the fringe of an ecstasy Scantly descried. Later images too did the day unfurl me, Shadowed and sad, Clay cadavers of those who had shared in the dramas, Laid now at ease, Passions all spent, chiefest the one of the broad brow Sepulture-clad. So did beset me scenes, miscalled of the bygone, Over the leaze, Past the clump, and down to where lay the beheld ones; —Yea, as the rhyme Sung by the sea-swell, so in their pleading dumbness Captured me these. For, their lost revisiting manifestations In their live time Much had I slighted, caring not for their purport, Seeing behind Things more coveted, reckoned the better worth calling Sweet, sad, sublime Thus do they now show hourly before the intenser Stare of the mind As they were ghosts avenging their slights by my bypast Body-borne eyes, Show, too, with fuller translation than rested upon them As living kind. Hence wag the tongues of the passing people, saying In their surmise, “Ah—whose is this dull form that perambulates, seeing nought Round him that looms Whithersoever his footsteps turn in his farings, Save a few tombs?” CHANNEL FIRING That night your great guns, unawares, Shook all our coffins as we lay, And broke the chancel window-squares, We thought it was the Judgment-day And sat upright. While drearisome Arose the howl of wakened hounds: The mouse let fall the altar-crumb, The worms drew back into the mounds, The glebe cow drooled. Till God called, “No; It's gunnery practice out at sea Just as before you went below; The world is as it used to be: “All nations striving strong to make Red war yet redder. Mad as hatters They do no more for Christés sake Than you who are helpless in such matters. “That this is not the judgment-hour For some of them's a blessed thing, For if it were they'd have to scour Hell's floor for so much threatening. . . . “Ha, ha. It will be warmer when I blow the trumpet (if indeed I ever do; for you are men, And rest eternal sorely need).” So down we lay again. “I wonder, Will the world ever saner be,” Said one, “than when He sent us under In our indifferent century!” And many a skeleton shook his head. “Instead of preaching forty year,” My neighbour Parson Thirdly said, “I wish I had stuck to pipes and beer.” Again the guns disturbed the hour, Roaring their readiness to avenge, As far inland as Stourton Tower, And Camelot, and starlit Stonehenge. April 1914. THE CONVERGENCE OF THE TWAIN (Lines on the loss of the “Titanic”) I In a solitude of the sea Deep from human vanity, And the Pride of Life that planned her, stilly couches she. II Steel chambers, late the pyres Of her salamandrine fires, Cold currents thrid, and turn to rhythmic tidal lyres. III Over the mirrors meant To glass the opulent The sea-worm crawls—grotesque, slimed, dumb, indifferent. IV Jewels in joy designed To ravish the sensuous mind Lie lightless, all their sparkles bleared and black and blind. V Dim moon-eyed fishes near Gaze at the gilded gear And query: “What does this vaingloriousness down here?” VI Well: while was fashioning This creature of cleaving wing, The Immanent Will that stirs and urges everything VII Prepared a sinister mate For her—so gaily great— A Shape of Ice, for the time far and dissociate. VIII And as the smart ship grew In stature, grace, and hue, In shadowy silent distance grew the Iceberg too. IX Alien they seemed to be: No mortal eye could see The intimate welding of their later history, X Or sign that they were bent By paths coincident On being anon twin halves of one august event. XI Till the Spinner of the Years Said “Now!” And each one hears, And consummation comes, and jars two hemispheres. THE GHOST OF THE PAST We two kept house, the Past and I, The Past and I; Through all my tasks it hovered nigh, Leaving me never alone. It was a spectral housekeeping Where fell no jarring tone, As strange, as still a housekeeping As ever has been known. As daily I went up the stair And down the stair, I did not mind the Bygone there— The Present once to me; Its moving meek companionship I wished might ever be, There was in that companionship Something of ecstasy. It dwelt with me just as it was, Just as it was When first its prospects gave me pause In wayward wanderings, Before the years had torn old troths As they tear all sweet things, Before gaunt griefs had torn old troths And dulled old rapturings. And then its form began to fade, Began to fade, Its gentle echoes faintlier played At eves upon my ear Than when the autumn's look embrowned The lonely chambers here, When autumn's settling shades embrowned Nooks that it haunted near. And so with time my vision less, Yea, less and less Makes of that Past my housemistress, It dwindles in my eye; It looms a far-off skeleton And not a comrade nigh, A fitful far-off skeleton Dimming as days draw by. AFTER THE VISIT (To F. E. D.) Come again to the place Where your presence was as a leaf that skims Down a drouthy way whose ascent bedims The bloom on the farer's face. Come again, with the feet That were light on the green as a thistledown ball, And those mute ministrations to one and to all Beyond a man's saying sweet. Until then the faint scent Of the bordering flowers swam unheeded away, And I marked not the charm in the changes of day As the cloud-colours came and went. Through the dark corridors Your walk was so soundless I did not know Your form from a phantom's of long ago Said to pass on the ancient floors, Till you drew from the shade, And I saw the large luminous living eyes Regard me in fixed inquiring-wise As those of a soul that weighed, Scarce consciously, The eternal question of what Life was, And why we were there, and by whose strange laws That which mattered most could not be. TO MEET, OR OTHERWISE Whether to sally and see thee, girl of my dreams, Or whether to stay And see thee not! How vast the difference seems Of Yea from Nay Just now. Yet this same sun will slant its beams At no far day On our two mounds, and then what will the difference weigh! Yet I will see thee, maiden dear, and make The most I can Of what remains to us amid this brake Cimmerian Through which we grope, and from whose thorns we ache, While still we scan Round our frail faltering progress for some path or plan. By briefest meeting something sure is won; It will have been: Nor God nor Demon can undo the done, Unsight the seen, Make muted music be as unbegun, Though things terrene Groan in their bondage till oblivion supervene. So, to the one long-sweeping symphony From times remote Till now, of human tenderness, shall we Supply one note, Small and untraced, yet that will ever be Somewhere afloat Amid the spheres, as part of sick Life's antidote. THE DIFFERENCE I Sinking down by the gate I discern the thin moon, And a blackbird tries over old airs in the pine, But the moon is a sorry one, sad the bird's tune, For this spot is unknown to that Heartmate of mine. II Did my Heartmate but haunt here at times such as now, The song would be joyous and cheerful the moon; But she will see never this gate, path, or bough, Nor I find a joy in the scene or the tune. THE SUN ON THE BOOKCASE (Student's Love-song: 1870) Once more the cauldron of the sun Smears the bookcase with winy red, And here my page is, and there my bed, And the apple-tree shadows travel along. Soon their intangible track will be run, And dusk grow strong And they have fled. Yes: now the boiling ball is gone, And I have wasted another day. . . . But wasted—wasted, do I say? Is it a waste to have imaged one Beyond the hills there, who, anon, My great deeds done, Will be mine alway? “WHEN I SET OUT FOR LYONNESSE” (1870) When I set out for Lyonnesse, A hundred miles away, The rime was on the spray, And starlight lit my lonesomeness When I set ouf for Lyonnesse A hundred miles away. What would bechance at Lyonnesse While I should sojourn there No prophet durst declare, Nor did the wisest wizard guess What would bechance at Lyonnesse While I should sojourn there. When I came back from Lyonnesse With magic in my eyes, All marked with mute surmise My radiance rare and fathomless, When I came back from Lyonnesse With magic in my eyes! A THUNDERSTORM IN TOWN (A Reminiscence: 1893) She wore a new “terra-cotta” dress, And we stayed, because of the pelting storm, Within the hansom's dry recess, Though the horse had stopped; yea, motionless We sat on, snug and warm. Then the downpour ceased, to my sharp sad pain And the glass that had screened our forms before Flew up, and out she sprang to her door: I should have kissed her if the rain Had lasted a minute more. THE TORN LETTER I I tore your letter into strips No bigger than the airy feathers That ducks preen out in changing weathers Upon the shifting ripple-tips. II In darkness on my bed alone I seemed to see you in a vision, And hear you say: “Why this derision Of one drawn to you, though unknown?” III Yes, eve's quick mood had run its course, The night had cooled my hasty madness; I suffered a regretful sadness Which deepened into real remorse. IV I thought what pensive patient days A soul must know of grain so tender How much of good must grace the sender Of such sweet words in such bright phrase. V Uprising then, as things unpriced I sought each fragment, patched and mended; The midnight whitened ere I had ended And gathered words I had sacrificed. VI But some, alas, of those I threw Were past my search, destroyed for ever: They were your name and place; and never Did I regain those clues to you. VII I learnt I had missed, by rash unheed, My track; that, so the Will decided, In life, death, we should be divided, And at the sense I ached indeed. VIII That ache for you, born long ago, Throbs on: I never could outgrow it. What a revenge, did you but know it! But that, thank God, you do not know. BEYOND THE LAST LAMP (Near Tooting Common) I While rain, with eve in partnership, Descended darkly, drip, drip, drip, Beyond the last lone lamp I passed Walking slowly, whispering sadly, Two linked loiterers, wan, downcast: Some heavy thought constrained each face, And blinded them to time and place. II The pair seemed lovers, yet absorbed In mental scenes no longer orbed By love's young rays. Each countenance As it slowly, as it sadly Caught the lamplight's yellow glance, Held in suspense a misery At things which had been or might be. III When I retrod that watery way Some hours beyond the droop of day, Still I found pacing there the twain Just as slowly, just as sadly, Heedless of the night and rain. One could but wonder who they were And what wild woe detained them there. IV Though thirty years of blur and blot Have slid since I beheld that spot, And saw in curious converse there Moving slowly, moving sadly That mysterious tragic pair, Its olden look may linger on— All but the couple; they have gone. V Whither? Who knows, indeed. . . . And yet To me, when nights are weird and wet, Without those comrades there at tryst Creeping slowly, creeping sadly, That lone lane does not exist. There they seem brooding on their pain, And will, while such a lane remain. THE FACE AT THE CASEMENT If ever joy leave An abiding sting of sorrow, So befell it on the morrow Of that May eve. . . . The travelled sun dropped To the north-west, low and lower, The pony's trot grew slower, Until we stopped. “This cosy house just by I must call at for a minute, A sick man lies within it Who soon will die. “He wished to—marry me, So I am bound, when I drive near him, To inquire, if but to cheer him, How he may be.” A message was sent in, And wordlessly we waited, Till some one came and stated The bulletin. And that the sufferer said, For her call no words could thank her; As his angel he must rank her Till life's spark fled. Slowly we drove away, When I turned my head, although not Called to: why I turned I know not Even to this day: And lo, there in my view Pressed against an upper lattice Was a white face, gazing at us As we withdrew. And well did I divine It to be the man's there dying, Who but lately had been sighing For her pledged mine. Then I deigned a deed of hell; It was done before I knew it; What devil made me do it I cannot tell! Yes, while he gazed above, I put my arm about her That he might see, nor doubt her My plighted Love. The pale face vanished quick, As if blasted, from the casement, And my shame and self-abasement Began their prick. And they prick on, ceaselessly, For that stab in Love's fierce fashion Which, unfired by lover's passion, Was foreign to me. She smiled at my caress, But why came the soft embowment Of her shoulder at that moment She did not guess. Long long years has he lain In thy garth, O sad Saint Cleather: What tears there, bared to weather, Will cleanse that stain! Love is long-suffering, brave, Sweet, prompt, precious as a jewel; But jealousy is cruel, Cruel as the grave! LOST LOVE I play my sweet old airs— The airs he knew When our love was true— But he does not balk His determined walk, And passes up the stairs. I sing my songs once more, And presently hear His footstep near As if it would stay; But he goes his way, And shuts a distant door. So I wait for another morn, And another night In this soul-sick blight; And I wonder much As I sit, why such A woman as I was born! “MY SPIRIT WILL NOT HAUNT THE MOUND” My spirit will not haunt the mound Above my breast, But travel, memory-possessed, To where my tremulous being found Life largest, best. My phantom-footed shape will go When nightfall grays Hither and thither along the ways I and another used to know In backward days. And there you'll find me, if a jot You still should care For me, and for my curious air; If otherwise, then I shall not, For you, be there. WESSEX HEIGHTS (1896) There are some heights in Wessex, shaped as if by a kindly hand For thinking, dreaming, dying on, and at crises when I stand, Say, on Ingpen Beacon eastward, or on Wylls-Neck westwardly, I seem where I was before my birth, and after death may be. In the lowlands I have no comrade, not even the lone man's friend— Her who suffereth long and is kind; accepts what he is too weak to mend: Down there they are dubious and askance; there nobody thinks as I, But mind-chains do not clank where one's next neighbour is the sky. In the towns I am tracked by phantoms having weird detective ways— Shadows of beings who fellowed with myself of earlier days: They hang about at places, and they say harsh heavy things— Men with a wintry sneer, and women with tart disparagings. Down there I seem to be false to myself, my simple self that was, And is not now, and I see him watching, wondering what crass cause Can have merged him into such a strange continuator as this, Who yet has something in common with himself, my chrysalis. I cannot go to the great grey Plain; there's a figure against the moon, Nobody sees it but I, and it makes my breast beat out of tune; I cannot go to the tall-spired town, being barred by the forms now passed For everybody but me, in whose long vision they stand there fast. There's a ghost at Yell'ham Bottom chiding loud at the fall of the night, There's a ghost in Froom-side Vale, thin-lipped and vague, in a shroud of white, There is one in the railway train whenever I do not want it near, I see its profile against the pane, saying what I would not hear. As for one rare fair woman, I am now but a thought of hers, I enter her mind and another thought succeeds me that she prefers; Yet my love for her in its fulness she herself even did not know; Well, time cures hearts of tenderness, and now I can let her go. So I am found on Ingpen Beacon, or on Wylls-Neck to the west, Or else on homely Bulbarrow, or little Pilsdon Crest, Where men have never cared to haunt, nor women have walked with me, And ghosts then keep their distance; and I know some liberty. IN DEATH DIVIDED I I shall rot here, with those whom in their day You never knew, And alien ones who, ere they chilled to clay, Met not my view, Will in your distant grave-place ever neighbour you. II No shade of pinnacle or tree or tower, While earth endures, Will fall on my mound and within the hour Steal on to yours; One robin never haunt our two green covertures. III Some organ may resound on Sunday noons By where you lie, Some other thrill the panes with other tunes Where moulder I; No selfsame chords compose our common lullaby. IV The simply-cut memorial at my head Perhaps may take A rustic form, and that above your bed A stately make; No linking symbol show thereon for our tale's sake. V And in the monotonous moils of strained, hard-run Humanity, The eternal tie which binds us twain in one No eye will see Stretching across the miles that sever you from me. 189?. THE PLACE ON THE MAP I I look upon the map that hangs by me— Its shires and towns and rivers lined in varnished artistry— And I mark a jutting height Coloured purple, with a margin of blue sea. II —'Twas a day of latter summer, hot and dry; Ay, even the waves seemed drying as we walked on, she and I By this spot where, calmly quite, She unfolded what would happen by and by. III This hanging map depicts the coast and place, And re-creates therewith our unforeboded troublous case All distinctly to my sight, And her tension, and the aspect of her face. IV Weeks and weeks we had loved beneath that blazing blue, Which had lost the art of raining, as her eyes to-day had too, While she told what, as by sleight, Shot our firmament with rays of ruddy hue. V For the wonder and the wormwood of the whole Was that what in realms of reason would have joyed our double soul Wore a torrid tragic light Under order-keeping's rigorous control. VI So, the map revives her words, the spot, the time, And the thing we found we had to face before the next year's prime; The charted coast stares bright, And its episode comes back in pantomime. THE SCHRECKHORN (With thoughts of Leslie Stephen) (June 1897) Aloof, as if a thing of mood and whim; Now that its spare and desolate figure gleams Upon my nearing vision, less it seems A looming Alp-height than a guise of him Who scaled its horn with ventured life and limb, Drawn on by vague imaginings, maybe, Of semblance to his personality In its quaint glooms, keen lights, and rugged trim. At his last change, when Life's dull coils unwind. Will he, in old love, hitherward escape, And the eternal essence of his mind Enter this silent adamantine shape, And his low voicing haunt its slipping snows When dawn that calls the climber dyes them rose? A SINGER ASLEEP (Algernon Charles Swinburne, 1837–1909) I In this fair niche above the unslumbering sea, That sentrys up and down all night, all day, From cove to promontory, from ness to bay, The Fates have fitly bidden that he should be Pillowed eternally. II —It was as though a garland of red roses Had fallen about the hood of some smug nun When irresponsibly dropped as from the sun, In fulth of numbers freaked with musical closes, Upon Victoria's formal middle time His leaves of rhythm and rhyme. III O that far morning of a summer day When, down a terraced street whose pavements lay Glassing the sunshine into my bent eyes, I walked and read with a quick glad surprise New words, in classic guise,— IV The passionate pages of his earlier years, Fraught with hot sighs, sad laughters, kisses, tears; Fresh-fluted notes, yet from a minstrel who Blew them not naïvely, but as one who knew Full well why thus he blew. V I still can hear the brabble and the roar At those thy tunes, O still one, now passed through That fitful fire of tongues then entered new! Their power is spent like spindrift on this shore; Thine swells yet more and more. VI —His singing-mistress verily was no other Than she the Lesbian, she the music-mother Of all the tribe that feel in melodies; Who leapt, love-anguished, from the Leucadian steep Into the rambling world-encircling deep Which hides her where none sees. VII And one can hold in thought that nightly here His phantom may draw down to the water's brim, And hers come up to meet it, as a dim Lone shine upon the heaving hydrosphere, And mariners wonder as they traverse near, Unknowing of her and him. VIII One dreams him sighing to her spectral form: “O teacher, where lies hid thy burning line; Where are those songs, O poetess divine Whose very orts are love incarnadine?” And her smile back: “Disciple true and warm, Sufficient now are thine.” . . . IX So here, beneath the waking constellations, Where the waves peal their everlasting strains, And their dull subterrene reverberations Shake him when storms make mountains of their plains— Him once their peer in sad improvisations, And deft as wind to cleave their frothy manes— I leave him, while the daylight gleam declines Upon the capes and chines. Bonchurch, 1910. A PLAINT TO MAN When you slowly emerged from the den of Time, And gained percipience as you grew, And fleshed you fair out of shapeless slime, Wherefore, O Man, did there come to you The unhappy need of creating me— A form like your own—for praying to? My virtue, power, utility, Within my maker must all abide, Since none in myself can ever be, One thin as a phasm on a lantern-slide Shown forth in the dark upon some dim sheet, And by none but its showman vivified. “Such a forced device,” you may say, “is meet For easing a loaded heart at whiles: Man needs to conceive of a mercy-seat Somewhere above the gloomy aisles Of this wailful world, or he could not bear The irk no local hope beguiles.” —But since I was framed in your first despair The doing without me has had no play In the minds of men when shadows scare; And now that I dwindle day by day Beneath the deicide eyes of seers In a light that will not let me stay, And to-morrow the whole of me disappears, The truth should be told, and the fact be faced That had best been faced in earlier years: The fact of life with dependence placed On the human heart's resource alone, In brotherhood bonded close and graced With loving-kindness fully blown, And visioned help unsought, unknown. 1909–10. GOD'S FUNERAL I I saw a slowly-stepping train— Lined on the brows, scoop-eyed and bent and hoar— Following in files across a twilit plain A strange and mystic form the foremost bore. II And by contagious throbs of thought Or latent knowledge that within me lay And had already stirred me, I was wrought To consciousness of sorrow even as they. III The fore-borne shape, to my blurred eyes, At first seemed man-like, and anon to change To an amorphous cloud of marvellous size, At times endowed with wings of glorious range. IV And this phantasmal variousness Ever possessed it as they drew along: Yet throughout all it symboled none the less Potency vast and loving-kindness strong. V Almost before I knew I bent Towards the moving columns without a word; They, growing in bulk and numbers as they went, Struck out sick thoughts that could be overheard:— VI “O man-projected Figure, of late Imaged as we, thy knell who shall survive? Whence came it we were tempted to create One whom we can no longer keep alive? VII “Framing him jealous, fierce, at first, We gave him justice as the ages rolled, Will to bless those by circumstance accurst, And longsuffering, and mercies manifold. VIII “And, tricked by our own early dream And need of solace, we grew self-deceived, Our making soon our maker did we deem, And what we had imagined we believed. IX “Till, in Time's stayless stealthy swing, Uncompromising rude reality Mangled the Monarch of our fashioning, Who quavered, sank; and now has ceased to be. X “So, toward our myth's oblivion, Darkling, and languid-lipped, we creep and grope Sadlier than those who wept in Babylon, Whose Zion was a still abiding hope. XI “How sweet it was in years far hied To start the wheels of day with trustful prayer, To lie down liegely at the eventide And feel a blest assurance he was there! XII “And who or what shall fill his place? Whither will wanderers turn distracted eyes For some fixed star to stimulate their pace Towards the goal of their enterprise?” . . . XIII Some in the background then I saw, Sweet women, youths, men, all incredulous, Who chimed: “This is a counterfeit of straw, This requiem mockery! Still he lives to us!” XIV I could not buoy their faith: and yet Many I had known: with all I sympathized; And though struck speechless, I did not forget That what was mourned for, I, too, long had prized. XV Still, how to bear such loss I deemed The insistent question for each animate mind, And gazing, to my growing sight there seemed A pale yet positive gleam low down behind, XVI Whereof, to lift the general night, A certain few who stood aloof had said, “See you upon the horizon that small light— Swelling somewhat?” Each mourner shook his head. XVII And they composed a crowd of whom Some were right good, and many nigh the best. . . . Thus dazed and puzzled 'twixt the gleam and gloom Mechanically I followed with the rest. 1908–10. SPECTRES THAT GRIEVE “It is not death that harrows us,” they lipped, “The soundless cell is in itself relief, For life is an unfenced flower, benumbed and nipped At unawares, and at its best but brief.” The speakers, sundry phantoms of the gone, Had risen like filmy flames of phosphor dye, As if the palest of sheet lightnings shone From the sward near me, as from a nether sky. And much surprised was I that, spent and dead, They should not, like the many, be at rest, But stray as apparitions; hence I said, “Why, having slipped life, hark you back distressed?” “We are among the few death sets not free, The hurt, misrepresented names, who come At each year's brink, and cry to History To do them justice, or go past them dumb. “We are stript of rights; our shames lie unredressed, Our deeds in full anatomy are not shown, Our words in morsels merely are expressed On the scriptured page, our motives blurred, unknown.” Then all these shaken slighted visitants sped Into the vague, and left me musing there On fames that well might instance what they had said, Until the New-Year's dawn strode up the air. “AH, ARE YOU DIGGING ON MY GRAVE?” “Ah, are you digging on my grave, My loved one?—planting rue?” —“No: yesterday he went to wed One of the brightest wealth has bred. ‘It cannot hurt her now,’ he said, ‘That I should not be true.’” “Then who is digging on my grave? My nearest dearest kin?” —“Ah, no: they sit and think, ‘What use! What good will planting flowers produce? No tendance of her mound can loose Her spirit from Death's gin.’” “But some one digs upon my grave? My enemy?—prodding sly?” —“Nay: when she heard you had passed the Gate That shuts on all flesh soon or late, She thought you no more worth her hate, And cares not where you lie.” “Then, who is digging on my grave? Say—since I have not guessed!” —“O it is I, my mistress dear, Your little dog, who still lives near, And much I hope my movements here Have not disturbed your rest?” “Ah, yes! You dig upon my grave . . . Why flashed it not on me That one true heart was left behind! What feeling do we ever find To equal among human kind A dog's fidelity!” “Mistress, I dug upon your grave To bury a bone, in case I should be hungry near this spot When passing on my daily trot. I am sorry, but I quite forgot It was your resting-place.” SELF-UNCONSCIOUS Along the way He walked that day, Watching shapes that reveries limn, And seldom he Had eyes to see The moment that encompassed him. Bright yellowhammers Made mirthful clamours, And billed long straws with a bustling air, And bearing their load Flew up the road That he followed, alone, without interest there. From bank to ground And over and round They sidled along the adjoining hedge; Sometimes to the gutter Their yellow flutter Would dip from the nearest slatestone ledge. The smooth sea-line With a metal shine, And flashes of white, and a sail thereon, He would also descry With a half-wrapt eye Between the projects he mused upon. Yes, round him were these Earth's artistries, But specious plans that came to his call Did most engage His pilgrimage, While himself he did not see at all. Dead now as sherds Are the yellow birds, And all that mattered has passed away; Yet God, the Elf, Now shows him that self As he was, and should have been shown, that day. O it would have been good Could he then have stood At a clear-eyed distance, and conned the whole, But now such vision Is mere derision, Nor soothes his body nor saves his soul. Not much, some may Incline to say, To see therein, had it all been seen. Nay! he is aware A thing was there That loomed with an immortal mien. Near Bossiney. THE DISCOVERY I wandered to a crude coast Like a ghost; Upon the hills I saw fires— Funeral pyres Seemingly—and heard breaking Waves like distant cannonades that set the land shaking. And so I never once guessed A Love-nest, Bowered and candle-lit, lay In my way, Till I found a hid hollow, Where I burst on her my heart could not but follow. TOLERANCE “It is a foolish thing,” said I, “To bear with such, and pass it by; Yet so I do, I know not why!” And at each cross I would surmise That if I had willed not in that wise I might have spared me many sighs. But now the only happiness In looking back that I possess— Whose lack would leave me comfortless— Is to remember I refrained From masteries I might have gained, And for my tolerance was disdained; For see, a tomb. And if it were I had bent and broke, I should not dare To linger in the shadows there. BEFORE AND AFTER SUMMER I Looking forward to the spring One puts up with anything. On this February day Though the winds leap down the street Wintry scourgings seem but play, And these later shafts of sleet —Sharper pointed than the first— And these later snows—the worst— Are as a half-transparent blind Riddled by rays from sun behind. II Shadows of the October pine Reach into this room of mine: On the pine there swings a bird; He is shadowed with the tree. Mutely perched he bills no word; Blank as I am even is he. For those happy suns are past, Fore-discerned in winter last. When went by their pleasure, then? I, alas, perceived not when. AT DAY-CLOSE IN NOVEMBER The ten hours' light is abating, And a late bird wings across, Where the pines, like waltzers waiting, Give their black heads a toss. Beech leaves, that yellow the noon-time, Float past like specks in the eye; I set every tree in my June time, And now they obscure the sky. And the children who ramble through here Conceive that there never has been A time when no tall trees grew here, That none will in time be seen. THE YEAR'S AWAKENING How do you know that the pilgrim track Along the belting zodiac Swept by the sun in his seeming rounds Is traced by now to the Fishes' bounds And into the Ram, when weeks of cloud Have wrapt the sky in a clammy shroud, And never as yet a tinct of spring Has shown in the Earth's apparelling; O vespering bird, how do you know, How do you know? How do you know, deep underground, Hid in your bed from sight and sound, Without a turn in temperature, With weather life can scarce endure, That light has won a fraction's strength, And day put on some moments' length, Whereof in merest rote will come, Weeks hence, mild airs that do not numb; O crocus root, how do you know, How do you know? February 1910. UNDER THE WATERFALL “Whenever I plunge my arm, like this, In a basin of water, I never miss The sweet sharp sense of a fugitive day Fetched back from its thickening shroud of gray. Hence the only prime And real love-rhyme That I know by heart, And that leaves no smart, Is the purl of a little valley fall About three spans wide and two spans tall Over a table of solid rock, And into a scoop of the self-same block; The purl of a runlet that never ceases In stir of kingdoms, in wars, in peaces; With a hollow boiling voice it speaks And has spoken since hills were turfless peaks.” “And why gives this the only prime Idea to you of a real love-rhyme? And why does plunging your arm in a bowl Full of spring water, bring throbs to your soul?” “Well, under the fall, in a crease of the stone, Though where precisely none ever has known, Jammed darkly, nothing to show how prized, And by now with its smoothness opalized, Is a drinking-glass: For, down that pass My lover and I Walked under a sky Of blue with a leaf-wove awning of green, In the burn of August, to paint the scene, And we placed our basket of fruit and wine By the runlet's rim, where we sat to dine; And when we had drunk from the glass together, Arched by the oak-copse from the weather, I held the vessel to rinse in the fall, Where it slipped, and sank, and was past recall, Though we stooped and plumbed the little abyss With long bared arms. There the glass still is. And, as said, if I thrust my arm below Cold water in basin or bowl, a throe From the past awakens a sense of that time, And the glass we used, and the cascade's rhyme. The basin seems the pool, and its edge The hard smooth face of the brook-side ledge, And the leafy pattern of china-ware The hanging plants that were bathing there. “By night, by day, when it shines or lours, There lies intact that chalice of ours, And its presence adds to the rhyme of love Persistently sung by the fall above. No lip has touched it since his and mine In turns therefrom sipped lovers' wine.” POEMS OF 1912–13 Veteris vestigia flammae THE GOING Why did you give no hint that night That quickly after the morrow's dawn, And calmly, as if indifferent quite, You would close your term here, up and be gone Where I could not follow With wing of swallow To gain one glimpse of you ever anon! Never to bid good-bye, Or lip me the softest call, Or utter a wish for a word, while I Saw morning harden upon the wall, Unmoved, unknowing That your great going Had place that moment, and altered all. Why do you make me leave the house And think for a breath it is you I see At the end of the alley of bending boughs Where so often at dusk you used to be; Till in darkening dankness The yawning blankness Of the perspective sickens me! You were she who abode By those red-veined rocks far West, You were the swan-necked one who rode Along the beetling Beeny Crest, And, reining nigh me, Would muse and eye me, While Life unrolled us its very best. Why, then, latterly did we not speak, Did we not think of those days long dead, And ere your vanishing strive to seek That time's renewal? We might have said, “In this bright spring weather We'll visit together Those places that once we visited.” Well, well! All's past amend, Unchangeable. It must go. I seem but a dead man held on end To sink down soon. . . . O you could not know That such swift fleeing No soul foreseeing— Not even I—would undo me so! December 1912. YOUR LAST DRIVE Here by the moorway you returned, And saw the borough lights ahead That lit your face—all undiscerned To be in a week the face of the dead, And you told of the charm of that haloed view That never again would beam on you. And on your left you passed the spot Where eight days later you were to lie, And be spoken of as one who was not; Beholding it with a heedless eye As alien from you, though under its tree You soon would halt everlastingly. I drove not with you. . . . Yet had I sat At your side that eve I should not have seen That the countenance I was glancing at Had a last-time look in the flickering sheen, Nor have read the writing upon your face, “I go hence soon to my resting-place; “You may miss me then. But I shall not know How many times you visit me there, Or what your thoughts are, or if you go There never at all. And I shall not care. Should you censure me I shall take no heed, And even your praises no more shall need.” True: never you'll know. And you will not mind. But shall I then slight you because of such? Dear ghost, in the past did you ever find The thought “What profit,” move me much? Yet abides the fact, indeed, the same,— You are past love, praise, indifference, blame. December 1912. THE WALK You did not walk with me Of late to the hill-top tree By the gated ways, As in earlier days; You were weak and lame, So you never came, And I went alone, and I did not mind, Not thinking of you as left behind. I walked up there to-day Just in the former way; Surveyed around The familiar ground By myself again: What difference, then? Only that underlying sense Of the look of a room on returning thence. RAIN ON A GRAVE Clouds spout upon her Their waters amain In ruthless disdain,— Her who but lately Had shivered with pain As at touch of dishonour If there had lit on her So coldly, so straightly Such arrows of rain: One who to shelter Her delicate head Would quicken and quicken Each tentative tread If drops chanced to pelt her That summertime spills In dust-paven rills When thunder-clouds thicken And birds close their bills. Would that I lay there And she were housed here! Or better, together Were folded away there Exposed to one weather We both,—who would stray there When sunny the day there, Or evening was clear At the prime of the year. Soon will be growing Green blades from her mound, And daisies be showing Like stars on the ground, Till she form part of them— Ay—the sweet heart of them, Loved beyond measure With a child's pleasure All her life's round. Jan. 31, 1913. “I FOUND HER OUT THERE” I found her out there On a slope few see, That falls westwardly To the salt-edged air, Where the ocean breaks On the purple strand, And the hurricane shakes The solid land. I brought her here, And have laid her to rest In a noiseless nest No sea beats near. She will never be stirred In her loamy cell By the waves long heard And loved so well. So she does not sleep By those haunted heights The Atlantic smites And the blind gales sweep, Whence she often would gaze At Dundagel's famed head, While the dipping blaze Dyed her face fire-red; And would sigh at the tale Of sunk Lyonnesse, As a wind-tugged tress Flapped her cheek like a flail; Or listen at whiles With a thought-bound brow To the murmuring miles She is far from now. Yet her shade, maybe, Will creep underground Till it catch the sound Of that western sea As it swells and sobs Where she once domiciled, And joy in its throbs With the heart of a child. WITHOUT CEREMONY It was your way, my dear, To vanish without a word When callers, friends, or kin Had left, and I hastened in To rejoin you, as I inferred. And when you'd a mind to career Off anywhere—say to town— You were all on a sudden gone Before I had thought thereon, Or noticed your trunks were down. So, now that you disappear For ever in that swift style, Your meaning seems to me Just as it used to be: “Good-bye is not worth while!” LAMENT How she would have loved A party to-day!— Bright-hatted and gloved, With table and tray And chairs on the lawn Her smiles would have shone With welcomings. . . . But She is shut, she is shut From friendship's spell In the jailing shell Of her tiny cell. Or she would have reigned At a dinner to-night With ardours unfeigned, And a generous delight; All in her abode She'd have freely bestowed On her guests. . . . But alas, She is shut under grass Where no cups flow, Powerless to know That it might be so. And she would have sought With a child's eager glance The shy snowdrops brought By the new year's advance, And peered in the rime Of Candlemas-time For crocuses . . . chanced It that she were not tranced From sights she loved best; Wholly possessed By an infinite rest! And we are here staying Amid these stale things, Who care not for gaying, And those junketings That used so to joy her, And never to cloy her As us they cloy! . . . But She is shut, she is shut From the cheer of them, dead To all done and said In her yew-arched bed. THE HAUNTER He does not think that I haunt here nightly: How shall I let him know That whither his fancy sets him wandering I, too, alertly go?— Hover and hover a few feet from him Just as I used to do, But cannot answer the words he lifts me— Only listen thereto! When I could answer he did not say them: When I could let him know How I would like to join in his journeys Seldom he wished to go. Now that he goes and wants me with him More than he used to do, Never he sees my faithful phantom Though he speaks thereto. Yes, I companion him to places Only dreamers know, Where the shy hares print long paces, Where the night rooks go; Into old aisles where the past is all to him, Close as his shade can do, Always lacking the power to call to him, Near as I reach thereto! What a good haunter I am, O tell him! Quickly make him know If he but sigh since my loss befell him Straight to his side I go. Tell him a faithful one is doing All that love can do Still that his path may be worth pursuing, And to bring peace thereto. THE VOICE Woman much missed, how you call to me, call to me, Saying that now you are not as you were When you had changed from the one who was all to me, But as at first, when our day was fair. Can it be you that I hear? Let me view you, then, Standing as when I drew near to the town Where you would wait for me: yes, as I knew you then, Even to the original air-blue gown! Or is it only the breeze, in its listlessness Travelling across the wet mead to me here, You being ever dissolved to wan wistlessness, Heard no more again far or near? Thus I; faltering forward, Leaves around me falling, Wind oozing thin through the thorn from norward, And the woman calling. December 1912. HIS VISITOR I come across from Mellstock while the moon wastes weaker To behold where I lived with you for twenty years and more: I shall go in the gray, at the passing of the mail-train, And need no setting open of the long familiar door As before. The change I notice in my once own quarters! A formal-fashioned border where the daisies used to be, The rooms new painted, and the pictures altered, And other cups and saucers, and no cosy nook for tea As with me. I discern the dim faces of the sleep-wrapt servants; They are not those who tended me through feeble hours and strong, But strangers quite, who never knew my rule here, Who never saw me painting, never heard my softling song Float along. So I don't want to linger in this re-decked dwelling, I feel too uneasy at the contrasts I behold, And I make again for Mellstock to return here never, And rejoin the roomy silence, and the mute and manifold Souls of old. 1913. A CIRCULAR As “legal representative” I read a missive not my own, On new designs the senders give For clothes, in tints as shown. Here figure blouses, gowns for tea, And presentation-trains of state, Charming ball-dresses, millinery, Warranted up to date. And this gay-pictured, spring-time shout Of Fashion, hails what lady proud? Her who before last year ebbed out Was costumed in a shroud. A DREAM OR NO Why go to Saint-Juliot? What's Juliot to me? Some strange necromancy But charmed me to fancy That much of my life claims the spot as its key. Yes. I have had dreams of that place in the West, And a maiden abiding Thereat as in hiding; Fair-eyed and white-shouldered, broad-browed and brown-tressed. And of how, coastward bound on a night long ago, There lonely I found her, The sea-birds around her, And other than nigh things uncaring to know. So sweet her life there (in my thought has it seemed) That quickly she drew me To take her unto me, And lodge her long years with me. Such have I dreamed. But nought of that maid from Saint-Juliot I see; Can she ever have been here, And shed her life's sheen here, The woman I thought a long housemate with me? Does there even a place like Saint-Juliot exist? Or a Vallency Valley With stream and leafed alley, Or Beeny, or Bos with its flounce flinging mist? February 1913. AFTER A JOURNEY Hereto I come to view a voiceless ghost; Whither, O whither will its whim now draw me? Up the cliff, down, till I'm lonely, lost, And the unseen waters' ejaculations awe me. Where you will next be there's no knowing, Facing round about me everywhere, With your nut-coloured hair, And gray eyes, and rose-flush coming and going. Yes: I have re-entered your olden haunts at last; Through the years, through the dead scenes I have tracked you; What have you now found to say of our past— Scanned across the dark space wherein I have lacked you? Summer gave us sweets, but autumn wrought division? Things were not lastly as firstly well With us twain, you tell? But all's closed now, despite Time's derision. I see what you are doing: you are leading me on To the spots we knew when we haunted here together, The waterfall, above which the mist-bow shone At the then fair hour in the then fair weather, And the cave just under, with a voice still so hollow That it seems to call out to me from forty years ago, When you were all aglow, And not the thin ghost that I now frailly follow! Ignorant of what there is flitting here to see, The waked birds preen and the seals flop lazily; Soon you will have, Dear, to vanish from me, For the stars close their shutters and the dawn whitens hazily. Trust me, I mind not, though Life lours, The bringing me here; nay, bring me here again! I am just the same as when Our days were a joy, and our paths through flowers. Pentargan Bay. A DEATH-DAY RECALLED Beeny did not quiver, Juliot grew not gray, Thin Vallency's river Held its wonted way. Bos seemed not to utter Dimmest note of dirge, Targan mouth a mutter To its creamy surge. Yet though these, unheeding, Listless, passed the hour Of her spirit's speeding, She had, in her flower, Sought and loved the places— Much and often pined For their lonely faces When in towns confined. Why did not Vallency In his purl deplore One whose haunts were whence he Drew his limpid store? Why did Bos not thunder, Targan apprehend Body and Breath were sunder Of their former friend? BEENY CLIFF March 1870–March 1913 I O the opal and the sapphire of that wandering western sea, And the woman riding high above with bright hair flapping free— The woman whom I loved so, and who loyally loved me. II The pale mews plained below us, and the waves seemed far away In a nether sky, engrossed in saying their ceaseless babbling say, As we laughed light-heartedly aloft on that clear-sunned March day. III A little cloud then cloaked us, and there flew an irised rain, And the Atlantic dyed its levels with a dull misfeatured stain, And then the sun burst out again, and purples prinked the main. IV —Still in all its chasmal beauty bulks old Beeny to the sky, And shall she and I not go there once again now March is nigh, And the sweet things said in that March say anew there by and by? V What if still in chasmal beauty looms that wild weird western shore, The woman now is—elsewhere—whom the ambling pony bore, And nor knows nor cares for Beeny, and will laugh there nevermore. AT CASTLE BOTEREL As I drive to the junction of lane and highway, And the drizzle bedrenches the waggonette, I look behind at the fading byway, And see on its slope, now glistening wet, Distinctly yet Myself and a girlish form benighted In dry March weather. We climb the road Beside a chaise. We had just alighted To ease the sturdy pony's load When he sighed and slowed. What we did as we climbed, and what we talked of Matters not much, nor to what it led,— Something that life will not be balked of Without rude reason till hope is dead, And feeling fled. It filled but a minute. But was there ever A time of such quality, since or before, In that hill's story? To one mind never, Though it has been climbed, foot-swift, foot-sore, By thousands more. Primaeval rocks form the road's steep border, And much have they faced there, first and last, Of the transitory in Earth's long order; But what they record in colour and cast Is—that we two passed. And to me, though Time's unflinching rigour, In mindless rote, has ruled from sight The substance now, one phantom figure Remains on the slope, as when that night Saw us alight. I look and see it there, shrinking, shrinking, I look back at it amid the rain For the very last time; for my sand is sinking, And I shall traverse old love's domain Never again. March 1913. PLACES Nobody says: Ah, that is the place Where chanced, in the hollow of years ago, What none of the Three Towns cared to know— The birth of a little girl of grace— The sweetest the house saw, first or last; Yet it was so On that day long past. Nobody thinks: There, there she lay In a room by the Hoe, like the bud of a flower, And listened, just after the bedtime hour, To the stammering chimes that used to play The quaint Old Hundred-and-Thirteenth tune In Saint Andrew's tower Night, morn, and noon. Nobody calls to mind that here Upon Boterel Hill, where the waggoners skid, With cheeks whose airy flush outbid Fresh fruit in bloom, and free of fear, She cantered down, as if she must fall (Though she never did), To the charm of all. Nay: one there is to whom these things, That nobody else's mind calls back, Have a savour that scenes in being lack, And a presence more than the actual brings; To whom to-day is beneaped and stale, And its urgent clack But a vapid tale. Plymouth, March 1913. THE PHANTOM HORSEWOMAN I Queer are the ways of a man I know: He comes and stands In a careworn craze, And looks at the sands And the seaward haze With moveless hands And face and gaze, Then turns to go . . . And what does he see when he gazes so? II They say he sees as an instant thing More clear than to-day, A sweet soft scene That was once in play By that briny green; Yes, notes alway Warm, real, and keen, What his back years bring— A phantom of his own figuring. III Of this vision of his they might say more: Not only there Does he see this sight, But everywhere In his brain—day, night, As if on the air It were drawn rose-bright— Yea, far from that shore Does he carry this vision of heretofore: IV A ghost-girl-rider. And though, toil-tried, He withers daily, Time touches her not, But she still rides gaily In his rapt thought On that shagged and shaly Atlantic spot, And as when first eyed Draws rein and sings to the swing of the tide. 1913. THE SPELL OF THE ROSE “I mean to build a hall anon, And shape two turrets there. And a broad newelled stair, And a cool well for crystal water; Yes; I will build a hall anon, Plant roses love shall feed upon, And apple-trees and pear.” He set to build the manor-hall, And shaped the turrets there, And the broad newelled stair, And the cool well for crystal water; He built for me that manor-hall, And planted many trees withal, But no rose anywhere. And as he planted never a rose That bears the flower of love, Though other flowers throve Some heart-bane moved our souls to sever Since he had planted never a rose; And misconceits raised horrid shows, And agonies came thereof. “I'll mend these miseries,” then said I, And so, at dead of night, I went and, screened from sight, That nought should keep our souls in severance, I set a rose-bush. “This,” said I, “May end divisions dire and wry, And long-drawn days of blight.” But I was called from earth—yea, called Before my rose-bush grew; And would that now I knew What feels he of the tree I planted, And whether, after I was called To be a ghost, he, as of old, Gave me his heart anew! Perhaps now blooms that queen of trees I set but saw not grow, And he, beside its glow— Eyes couched of the mis-vision that blurred me— Ay, there beside that queen of trees He sees me as I was, though sees Too late to tell me so! ST. LAUNCE'S REVISITED Slip back, Time! Yet again I am nearing Castle and keep, uprearing Gray, as in my prime. At the inn Smiling nigh, why is it Not as on my visit When hope and I were twin? Groom and jade Whom I found here, moulder; Strange the tavern-holder, Strange the tap-maid. Here I hired Horse and man for bearing Me on my wayfaring To the door desired. Evening gloomed As I journeyed forward To the faces shoreward, Till their dwelling loomed. If again Towards the Atlantic sea there I should speed, they'd be there Surely now as then? . . . Why waste thought, When I know them vanished Under earth; yea, banished Ever into nought! WHERE THE PICNIC WAS Where we made the fire In the summer time Of branch and briar On the hill to the sea, I slowly climb Through winter mire, And scan and trace The forsaken place Quite readily. Now a cold wind blows, And the grass is gray, But the spot still shows As a burnt circle—aye, And stick-ends, charred, Still strew the sward Whereon I stand, Last relic of the band Who came that day! Yes, I am here Just as last year, And the sea breathes brine From its strange straight line Up hither, the same As when we four came. —But two have wandered far From this grassy rise Into urban roar Where no picnics are, And one—has shut her eyes For evermore. MISCELLANEOUS PIECES THE WISTFUL LADY “Love, while you were away there came to me— From whence I cannot tell— A plaintive lady pale and passionless, Who laid her eyes upon me critically, And weighed me with a wearing wistfulness, As if she knew me well.” “I saw no lady of that wistful sort As I came riding home. Perhaps she was some dame the Fates constrain By memories sadder than she can support, Or by unhappy vacancy of brain, To leave her roof and roam?” “Ah, but she knew me. And before this time I have seen her, lending ear To my light outdoor words, and pondering each, Her frail white finger swayed in pantomime, As if she fain would close with me in speech, And yet would not come near. “And once I saw her beckoning with her hand As I came into sight At an upper window. And I at last went out; But when I reached where she had seemed to stand, And wandered up and down and searched about, I found she had vanished quite.” Then thought I how my dead Love used to say, With a small smile, when she Was waning wan, that she would hover round And show herself after her passing day To any newer Love I might have found, But show her not to me. THE WOMAN IN THE RYE “Why do you stand in the dripping rye, Cold-lipped, unconscious, wet to the knee, When there are firesides near?” said I. “I told him I wished him dead,” said she. “Yea, cried it in my haste to one Whom I had loved, whom I well loved still; And die he did. And I hate the sun, And stand here lonely, aching, chill; “Stand waiting, waiting under skies That blow reproach, the while I see The rooks sheer off to where he lies Wrapt in a peace withheld from me!” THE CHEVAL-GLASS Why do you harbour that great cheval-glass Filling up your narrow room? You never preen or plume Or look in a week at your full-length figure— Picture of bachelor gloom! “Well, when I dwelt in ancient England, Renting the valley farm, Thoughtless of all heart-harm, I used to gaze at the parson's daughter, A creature of nameless charm. “Thither there came a lover and won her Carried her off from my view. O it was then I knew Misery of a cast undreamt of— More than, indeed, my due! “Then far rumours of her ill-usage Came, like a chilling breath When a man languisheth; Followed by news that her mind lost balance, And, in a space, of her death. “Soon sank her father; and next was the auction— Everything to be sold: Mid things new and old Stood this glass in her former chamber, Long in her use, I was told. “Well, I awaited the sale and bought it. . . . There by my bed it stands, And as the dawn expands Often I see her pale-faced form there Brushing her hair's bright bands. “There, too, at pallid midnight moments Quick she will come to my call, Smile from the frame withal Ponderingly, as she used to regard me Passing her father's wall. “So that it was for its revelations I brought it oversea, And drag it about with me. . . . Anon I shall break it and bury its fragments Where my grave is to be.” THE RE-ENACTMENT Between the folding sea-downs, In the gloom Of a wailful wintry nightfall, When the boom Of the ocean, like a hammering in a hollow tomb, Throbbed up the copse-clothed valley From the shore To the chamber where I darkled, Sunk and sore With gray ponderings why my Loved one had not come before To salute me in the dwelling That of late I had hired to waste a while in— Dim of date, Quaint, and remote—wherein I now expectant sate; On the solitude, unsignalled, Broke a man Who, in air as if at home there, Seemed to scan Every fire-flecked nook of the apartment span by span, A stranger's and no lover's Eyes were these, Eyes of a man who measures What he sees But vaguely, as if wrapt in filmy phantasies. Yea, his bearing was so absent As he stood, It bespoke a chord so plaintive In his mood, That soon I judged he would not wrong my quietude. “Ah—the supper is just ready!” Then he said, “And the years'-long-binned Madeira Flashes red!” (There was no wine, no food, no supper-table spread.) “You will forgive my coming, Lady fair? I see you as at that time Rising there, The self-same curious querying in your eyes and air. “Yet no. How so? You wear not The same gown, Your locks show woful difference, Are not brown: What, is it not as when I hither came from town? “And the place. . . . But you seem other— Can it be? What's this that Time is doing Unto me? You dwell here, unknown woman? . . . Whereabouts, then, is she? “And the house-things are much shifted.— Put them where They stood on this night's fellow; Shift her chair: Here was the couch: and the piano should be there.” I indulged him, verily nerve-strained Being alone, And I moved the things as bidden, One by one, And feigned to push the old piano where he had shown. “Aha—now I can see her! Stand aside: Don't thrust her from the table Where, meek-eyed, She makes attempt with matron-manners to preside. “She serves me: now she rises, Goes to play. . . . But you obstruct her, fill her With dismay, And all-embarrassed, scared, she vanishes away!” And, as 'twere useless longer To persist, He sighed, and sought the entry Ere I wist, And retreated, disappearing soundless in the mist. That here some mighty passion Once had burned, Which still the walls enghosted, I discerned, And that by its strong spell mine might be overturned. I sat depressed; till, later, My Love came; But something in the chamber Dimmed our flame,— An emanation, making our due words fall tame. As if the intenser drama Shown me there Of what the walls had witnessed Filled the air, And left no room for later passion anywhere. So came it that our fervours Did quite fail Of future consummation— Being made quail By the weird witchery of the parlour's hidden tale, Which I, as years passed, faintly Learnt to trace,— One of sad love, born full-winged In that place Where the predestined sorrowers first stood face to face. And as that month of winter Circles round, And the evening of the date-day Grows embrowned, I am conscious of those presences, and sit spellbound. There, often—lone, forsaken— Queries breed Within me; whether a phantom Had my heed On that strange night, or was it some wrecked heart indeed? HER SECRET That love's dull smart distressed my heart He shrewdly learnt to see, But that I was in love with a dead man Never suspected he. He searched for the trace of a pictured face, He watched each missive come, And a sheet that seemed like a love-line Wrought his look lurid and numb. He dogged my feet to the city street, He followed me to the sea, But not to the nigh, still churchyard Did he dream of following me! “SHE CHARGED ME” She charged me with having said this and that To another woman long years before, In the very parlour where we sat,— Sat on a night when the endless pour Of rain on the roof and the road below Bent the spring of the spirit more and more. . . —So charged she me; and the Cupid's bow Of her mouth was hard, and her eyes, and her face, And her white forefinger lifted slow. Had she done it gently, or shown a trace That not too curiously would she view A folly flown ere her reign had place, A kiss might have closed it. But I knew From the fall of each word, and the pause between, That the curtain would drop upon us two Ere long, in our play of slave and queen. THE NEWCOMER'S WIFE He paused on the sill of a door ajar That screened a lively liquor-bar, For the name had reached him through the door Of her he had married the week before. “We called her the Hack of the Parade; But she was discreet in the games she played; If slightly worn, she's pretty yet, And gossips, after all, forget: “And he knows nothing of her past; I am glad the girl's in luck at last; Such ones, though stale to native eyes, Newcomers snatch at as a prize.” “Yes, being a stranger he sees her blent Of all that's fresh and innocent, Nor dreams how many a love-campaign She had enjoyed before his reign!” That night there was the splash of a fall Over the slimy harbour-wall: They searched, and at the deepest place Found him with crabs upon his face. A CONVERSATION AT DAWN He lay awake, with a harassed air, And she, in her cloud of loose lank hair, Seemed trouble-tried As the dawn drew in on their faces there. The chamber looked far over the sea From a white hotel on a white-stoned quay, And stepping a stride He parted the window-drapery. Above the level horizon spread The sunrise, firing them foot to head From its smouldering lair, And painting their pillows with dyes of red. “What strange disquiets have stirred you, dear, This dragging night, with starts in fear Of me, as it were, Or of something evil hovering near?” “My husband, can I have fear of you? What should one fear from a man whom few, Or none, had matched In that late long spell of delays undue!” He watched her eyes in the heaving sun: “Then what has kept, O reticent one, Those lids unlatched— Anything promised I've not yet done?” “O it's not a broken promise of yours (For what quite lightly your lip assures The due time brings) That has troubled my sleep, and no waking cures!” . . . “I have shaped my will; 'tis at hand,” said he; “I subscribe it to-day, that no risk there be In the hap of things Of my leaving you menaced by poverty.” “That a boon provision I'm safe to get, Signed, sealed by my lord as it were a debt, I cannot doubt, Or ever this peering sun be set.” “But you flung my arms away from your side, And faced the wall. No month-old bride Ere the tour be out In an air so loth can be justified? “Ah—had you a male friend once loved well, Upon whose suit disaster fell And frustrance swift? Honest you are, and may care to tell.” She lay impassive, and nothing broke The stillness other than, stroke by stroke, The lazy lift Of the tide below them; till she spoke: “I once had a friend—a Love, if you will— Whose wife forsook him, and sank until She was made a thrall In a prison-cell for a deed of ill. . . . “He remained alone; and we met—to love, But barring legitimate joy thereof Stood a doorless wall, Though we prized each other all else above. “And this was why, though I'd touched my prime, I put off suitors from time to time— Yourself with the rest— Till friends, who approved you, called it crime, “And when misgivings weighed on me In my lover's absence, hurriedly, And much distrest, I took you. . . . Ah, that such could be!. . . “Now, saw you when crossing from yonder shore At yesternoon, that the packet bore On a white-wreathed bier A coffined body towards the fore? “Well, while you stood at the other end, The loungers talked, and I couldn't but lend A listening ear, For they named the dead. 'Twas the wife of my friend. “He was there, but did not note me, veiled, Yet I saw that a joy, as of one unjailed, Now shone in his gaze; He knew not his hope of me just had failed! “They had brought her home: she was born in this isle; And he will return to his domicile, And pass his days Alone, and not as he dreamt erstwhile!” “—So you've lost a sprucer spouse than I!” She held her peace, as if fain deny She would indeed For his pleasure's sake, but could lip no lie. “One far less formal and plain and slow!” She let the laconic assertion go As if of need She held the conviction that it was so. “Regard me as his he always should, He had said, and wed me he vowed he would In his prime or sere Most verily do, if ever he could; “And this fulfilment is now his aim, For a letter, addressed in my maiden name, Has dogged me here, Reminding me faithfully of his claim; “And it started a hope like a lightning-streak That I might go to him—say for a week— And afford you right To put me away, and your vows unspeak. “To be sure you have said, as of dim intent, That marriage is a plain event Of black and white, Without any ghost of sentiment, “And my heart has quailed.—But deny it true That you will never this lock undo! No God intends To thwart the yearning He's father to!” The husband hemmed, then blandly bowed In the light of the angry morning cloud. “So my idyll ends, And a drama opens!” he mused aloud; And his features froze. “You may take it as true That I will never this lock undo For so depraved A passion as that which kindles you!” Said she: “I am sorry you see it so; I had hoped you might have let me go, And thus been saved The pain of learning there's more to know.” “More? What may that be? Gad, I think You have told me enough to make me blink! Yet if more remain Then own it to me. I will not shrink!” “Well, it is this. As we could not see That a legal marriage would ever be, To end our pain We united ourselves informally; “And vowed at a chancel-altar nigh, With book and ring, a lifelong tie; A contract vain To the world, but real to Him on High.” “And you became as his wife?”—“I did.”— He stood as stiff as a caryatid, And said, “Indeed! . . . No matter. You're mine, whatever you've hid!” “But is it right! When I only gave My hand to you in a sweat to save, Through desperate need (As I thought), my fame, for I was not brave!” “To save your fame? Your meaning is dim, For nobody knew of your altar-whim?” “I mean—I feared There might be fruit of my tie with him; “And to cloak it by marriage I'm not the first, Though, maybe, morally most accurst Through your unpeered And strict uprightness. That's the worst! “While yesterday his worn contours Convinced me that love like his endures, And that my troth-plight Had been his, in fact, and not truly yours.” “So, my lady, you raise the veil by degrees. . . . I own this last is enough to freeze The warmest wight! Now hear the other side, if you please: “I did say once, though without intent. That marriage is a plain event Of black and white, Whatever may be its sentiment: “I'll act accordingly, none the less That you soiled the contract in time of stress, Thereto induced By the feared results of your wantonness. “But the thing is over, and no one knows, And it's nought to the future what you disclose. That you'll be loosed For such an episode, don't suppose! “No: I'll not free you. And if it appear There was too good ground for your first fear From your amorous tricks, I'll father the child. Yes, by God, my dear! “Even should you fly to his arms, I'll damn Opinion, and fetch you; treat as sham Your mutinous kicks, And whip you home. That's the sort I am!” She whitened. “Enough. . . . Since you disapprove I'll yield in silence, and never move Till my last pulse ticks A footstep from the domestic groove.” “Then swear it,” he said, “and your king uncrown.” He drew her forth in her long white gown, And she knelt and swore. “Good. Now you may go and again lie down. “Since you've played these pranks and given no sign, You shall crave this man of yours; pine and pine With sighings sore, 'Till I've starved your love for him; nailed you mine! “I'm a practical man, and want no tears; You've made a fool of me, it appears; That you don't again Is a lesson I'll teach you in future years.” She answered not, lying listlessly With her dark dry eyes on the coppery sea, That now and then Flung its lazy flounce at the neighbouring quay. 1910. A KING'S SOLILOQUY ON THE NIGHT OF HIS FUNERAL From the slow march and muffled drum, And crowds distrest, And book and bell, at length I have come To my full rest. A ten years' rule beneath the sun Is wound up here, And what I have done, what left undone, Figures out clear. Yet in the estimate of such It grieves me more That I by some was loved so much Than that I bore, From others, judgment of that hue Which over-hope Breeds from a theoretic view Of regal scope. For kingly opportunities Right many have sighed; How best to bear its devilries Those learn who have tried! I have eaten the fat and drunk the sweet, Lived the life out From the first greeting glad drum-beat To the last shout. What pleasure earth affords to kings I have enjoyed Through its long vivid pulse-stirrings Even till it cloyed. What days of drudgery, nights of stress Can cark a throne, Even one maintained in peacefulness, I too have known. And so, I think, could I step back To life again, I should prefer the average track Of average men, Since, as with them, what kingship would It cannot do, Nor to first thoughts however good Hold itself true. Something binds hard the royal hand, As all that be, And it is That has shaped, has planned My acts and me. May 1910. THE CORONATION At Westminster, hid from the light of day, Many who once had shone as monarchs lay. Edward the Pious, and two Edwards more, The second Richard, Henrys three or four; That is to say, those who were called the Third, Fifth, Seventh, and Eighth (the much self-widowered); And James the Scot, and near him Charles the Second, And, too, the second George could there be reckoned. Of women, Mary and Queen Elizabeth, And Anne, all silent in a musing death; And William's Mary, and Mary, Queen of Scots, And consort-queens whose names oblivion blots; And several more whose chronicle one sees Adorning ancient royal pedigrees. —Now, as they drowsed on, freed form Life's old thrall, And heedless, save of things exceptional, Said one: “What means this throbbing thudding sound That reaches to us here from overground; “A sound of chisels, augers, planes, and saws, Infringing all ecclesiastic laws? “And these tons-weight of timber on us pressed, Unfelt here since we entered into rest? “Surely, at least to us, being corpses royal, A meet repose is owing by the loyal?” “—Perhaps a scaffold!” Mary Stuart sighed, “If such still be. It was that way I died.” “—Ods! Far more like,” said he the many-wived, “That for a wedding 'tis this work's contrived. “Ha-ha! I never would bow down to Rimmon, But I had a rare time with those six women!” “Not all at once?” gasped he who loved confession. “Nay, nay!” said Hal. “That would have been transgression.” “—They build a catafalque here, black and tall, Perhaps,” mused Richard, “for some funeral?” And Anne chimed in: “Ah, yes: it may be so!” “Nay!” squeaked Eliza. “Little you seem to know— “Clearly 'tis for some crowning here in state, As they crowned us at our long bygone date; “Though we'd no such a power of carpentry, But let the ancient architecture be; “If I were up there where the parsons sit, In one of my gold robes, I'd see to it!” “But you are not,” Charles chuckled. “You are here, And never will know the sun again, my dear!” “Yea,” whispered those whom no one had addressed; “With slow, sad march, amid a folk distressed, We were brought here, to take our dusty rest. “And here, alas, in darkness laid below, We'll wait and listen, and endure the show. . . . Clamour dogs kingship; afterwards not so!” 1911. AQUAE SULIS The chimes called midnight, just at interlune, And the daytime parle on the Roman investigations Was shut to silence, save for the husky tune The bubbling waters played near the excavations. And a warm air came up from underground, And the flutter of a filmy shape unsepulchred, That collected itself, and waited, and looked around: Nothing was seen, but utterances could be heard: Those of the Goddess whose shrine was beneath the pile Of the God with the baldachined altar overhead: “And what did you win by raising this nave and aisle Close on the site of the temple I tenanted? “The notes of your organ have thrilled down out of view To the earth-clogged wrecks of my edifice many a year, Though stately and shining once—ay, long ere you Had set up crucifix and candle here. “Your priests have trampled the dust of mine without rueing, Despising the joys of man whom I so much loved, Though my springs boil on by your Gothic arcades and pewing, And sculptures crude. . . . Would Jove they could be removed!” “Repress, O lady proud, your traditional ires; You know not by what a frail thread we equally hang; It is said we are images both—twitched by people's desires; And that I, as you, fail like a song men yesterday sang!” “What—a Jumping-jack you, and myself but a poor Jumping-jill, Now worm-eaten, times agone twitched at Humanity's bid? O I cannot endure it!—But, chance to us whatso there will, Let us kiss and be friends! Come, agree you?”—None heard if he did. . . . And the olden dark hid the cavities late laid bare, And all was suspended and soundless as before, Except for a gossamery noise fading off in the air, And the boiling voice of the waters' medicinal pour. Bath. SEVENTY-FOUR AND TWENTY Here goes a man of seventy-four, Who sees not what life means for him, And here another in years a score Who reads its very figure and trim. The one who shall walk to-day with me Is not the youth who gazes far, But the breezy sire who cannot see What Earth's ingrained conditions are. THE ELOPEMENT “A woman never agreed to it!” said my knowing friend to me. “That one thing she'd refuse to do for Solomon's mines in fee: No woman ever will make herself look older than she is.” I did not answer; but I thought, “you err there, ancient Quiz.” It took a rare one, true, to do it; for she was surely rare— As rare a soul at that sweet time of her life as she was fair, And urging heart-heaves, too, were strong, for ours was a passionate case, Yea, passionate enough to lead to freaking with that young face. I have told no one about it, should perhaps make few believe, But I think it over now that life looms dull and years bereave, How blank we stood at our bright wits' end, two blown barks in distress, How self-regard in her was slain by her large tenderness. I said: “The only chance for us in a crisis of this kind Is going it thorough!”—“Yes,” she calmly breathed. “Well, I don't mind.” And we blanched her dark locks ruthlessly: set wrinkles on her brow; Ay—she was a right rare woman then, whatever she may be now. That night we heard a coach drive up, and questions asked below. “A gent with an elderly wife, sir,” was returned from the bureau. And the wheels went rattling on, and free at last from public ken We washed all off in her chamber and restored her youth again. How many years ago it was! Some fifty can it be Since that adventure held us, and she played old wife to me? But in time convention won her, as it wins all women at last, And now she is rich and respectable, and time has buried the past. “I ROSE UP AS MY CUSTOM IS” I rose up as my custom is On the eve of All-Souls' day, And left my grave for an hour or so To call on those I used to know Before I passed away. I visited my former Love As she lay by her husband's side; I asked her if life pleased her, now She was rid of a poet wrung in brow, And crazed with the ills he eyed; Who used to drag her here and there Wherever his fancies led, And point out pale phantasmal things, And talk of vain vague purposings That she discredited. She was quite civil, and replied, “Old comrade, is that you? Well, on the whole, I like my life.— I know I swore I'd be no wife, But what was I to do? “You see, of all men for my sex A poet is the worst; Women are practical, and they Crave the wherewith to pay their way, And slake their social thirst. “You were a poet—quite the ideal That we all love awhile: But look at this man snoring here— He's no romantic chanticleer, Yet keeps me in good style. “He makes no quest into my thoughts, But a poet wants to know What one has felt from earliest days, Why one thought not in other ways, And one's Loves of long ago.” Her words benumbed my fond faint ghost; The nightmares neighed from their stalls, The vampires screeched, the harpies flew, And under the dim dawn I withdrew To Death's inviolate halls. A WEEK On Monday night I closed my door, And thought you were not as heretofore, And little cared if we met no more. I seemed on Tuesday night to trace Something beyond mere commonplace In your ideas, and heart, and face. On Wednesday I did not opine Your life would ever be one with mine, Though if it were we should well combine. On Thursday noon I liked you well, And fondly felt that we must dwell Not far apart, whatever befell. On Friday it was with a thrill In gazing towards your distant vill I owned you were my dear one still. I saw you wholly to my mind On Saturday—even one who shrined All that was best of womankind. As wing-clipt sea-gull for the sea On Sunday night I longed for thee, Without whom life were waste to me! HAD YOU WEPT Had you wept; had you but neared me with a hazed uncertain ray, Dewy as the face of the dawn, in your large and luminous eye, Then would have come back all the joys the tidings had slain that day, And a new beginning, a fresh fair heaven, have smoothed the things awry. But you were less feebly human, and no passionate need for clinging Possessed your soul to overthrow reserve when I came near; Ay, though you suffer as much as I from storms the hours are bringing Upon your heart and mine, I never see you shed a tear. The deep strong woman is weakest, the weak one is the strong; The weapon of all weapons best for winning, you have not used; Have you never been able, or would you not, through the evil times and long? Has not the gift been given you, or such gift have you refused? When I bade me not absolve you on that evening or the morrow, Why did you not make war on me with those who weep like rain? You felt too much, so gained no balm for all your torrid sorrow, And hence our deep division, and our dark undying pain. BEREFT, SHE THINKS SHE DREAMS I dream that the dearest I ever knew Has died and been entombed. I am sure it's a dream that cannot be true, But I am so overgloomed By its persistence, that I would gladly Have quick death take me, Rather than longer think thus sadly; So wake me, wake me! It has lasted days, but minute and hour I expect to get aroused And find him as usual in the bower Where we so happily housed. Yet stays this nightmare too appalling, And like a web shakes me, And piteously I keep on calling, And no one wakes me! IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM “What do you see in that time-touched stone, When nothing is there But ashen blankness, although you give it A rigid stare? “You look not quite as if you saw, But as if you heard, Parting your lips, and treading softly As mouse or bird. “It is only the base of a pillar, they'll tell you, That came to us From a far old hill men used to name Areopagus.” —“I know no art, and I only view A stone from a wall, But I am thinking that stone has echoed The voice of Paul; “Paul as he stood and preached beside it Facing the crowd, A small gaunt figure with wasted features, Calling out loud “Words that in all their intimate accents Pattered upon That marble front, and were wide reflected, And then were gone. “I'm a labouring man, and know but little, Or nothing at all; But I can't help thinking that stone once echoed The voice of Paul.” IN THE SERVANTS' QUARTERS “Man, you too, aren't you, one of these rough followers of the criminal? All hanging hereabout to gather how he's going to bear Examination in the hall.” She flung disdainful glances on The shabby figure standing at the fire with others there, Who warmed them by its flare. “No indeed, my skipping maiden: I know nothing of the trial here, Or criminal, if so he be.—I chanced to come this way, And the fire shone out into the dawn, and morning airs are cold now; I, too, was drawn in part by charms I see before me play, That I see not every day.” “Ha, ha!” then laughed the constables who also stood to warm themselves, The while another maiden scrutinized his features hard, As the blaze threw into contrast every line and knot that wrinkled them, Exclaiming, “Why, last night when he was brought in by the guard, You were with him in the yard!” “Nay, nay, you teasing wench, I say! You know you speak mistakenly. Cannot a tired pedestrian who has legged it long and far Here on his way from northern parts, engrossed in humble marketings, Come in and rest awhile, although judicial doings are Afoot by morning star?” “O, come, come!” laughed the constables. “Why, man, you speak the dialect He uses in his answers; you can hear him up the stairs. So own it. We sha'n't hurt ye. There he's speaking now! His syllables Are those you sound yourself when you are talking unawares, As this pretty girl declares.” “And you shudder when his chain clinks!” she rejoined. “O yes, I noticed it. And you winced, too, when those cuffs they gave him echoed to us here. They'll soon be coming down, and you may then have to defend yourself Unless you hold your tongue, or go away and keep you clear When he's led to judgment near!” “No! I'll be damned in hell if I know anything about the man! No single thing about him more than everybody knows! Must not I even warm my hands but I am charged with blasphemies?” . . . —His face convulses as the morning cock that moment crows, And he droops, and turns, and goes. THE OBLITERATE TOMB “More than half my life long Did they weigh me falsely, to my bitter wrong, But they all have shrunk away into the silence Like a lost song. “And the day has dawned and come For forgiveness, when the past may hold it dumb On the once reverberate words of hatred uttered Half in delirium. . . . “With folded lips and hands They lie and wait what next the Will commands, And doubtless think, if think they can: ‘Let discord Sink with Life's sands!’ “By these late years their names, Their virtues, their hereditary claims, May be as near defacement at their grave-place As are their fames.” —Such thoughts bechanced to seize A traveller's mind—a man of memories— As he set foot within the western city Where had died these Who in their lifetime deemed Him their chief enemy—one whose brain had schemed To get their dingy greatness deeplier dingied And disesteemed. So, sojourning in their town, He mused on them and on their once renown, And said, “I'll seek their resting-place to-morrow Ere I lie down, “And end, lest I forget, Those ires of many years that I regret, Renew their names, that men may see some liegeness Is left them yet.” Duly next night he went And sought the church he had known them to frequent, And wandered, lantern-bearing, in the precincts, Where they lay pent, Till by remembrance led He stood at length beside their slighted bed. Above which, truly, scarce a line or letter Could now be read. “Thus years obliterate Their graven worth, their chronicle, their date! At once I'll garnish and revive the record Of their past state, “That still the sage may say In pensive progress here where they decay, ‘This stone records a luminous line whose talents Told in their day.’” While dreaming thus he turned, For a form shadowed where they lay inurned, And he beheld a stranger in foreign vesture, And tropic-burned. “Sir, I am right pleased to view That ancestors of mine should interest you, For I have fared of purpose here to find them. . . . They are time-worn, true, “But that's a fault, at most, Carvers can cure. On the Pacific coast I have vowed for long that relics of my forbears I'd trace ere lost, “And hitherward I come, Before this same old Time shall strike me numb, To carry it out.”—“Strange, this is!” said the other; “What mind shall plumb “Coincident design! Though these my father's enemies were and mine, I nourished a like purpose—to restore them Each letter and line.” “Such magnanimity Is now not needed, sir; for you will see That since I am here, a thing like this is, plainly, Best done by me.” The other bowed, and left, Crestfallen in sentiment, as one bereft Of some fair object he had been moved to cherish, By hands more deft. And as he slept that night The phantoms of the ensepulchred stood upright Before him, trembling that he had set him seeking Their charnel-site. And, as unknowing his ruth, Asked as with terrors founded not on truth Why he should want them. “Ha,” they hollowly hackered, “You come, forsooth, “By stealth to obliterate Our graven worth, our chronicle, our date, That our descendant may not gild the record Of our past state, “And that no sage may say In pensive progress near where we decay: ‘This stone records a luminous line whose talents Told in their day.’” Upon the morrow he went, And to that town and churchyard never bent His ageing footsteps till, some twelvemonths onward, An accident Once more detained him there; And, stirred by hauntings, he must needs repair To where the tomb was. Lo, it stood still wasting In no man's care. And so the tomb remained Untouched, untended, crumbling, weather-stained, And though the one-time foe was fain to right it He still refrained. “I'll set about it when I am sure he'll come no more. Best wait till then.” But so it was that never the kinsman entered That city again. Till doubts grew keen If it had chanced not that the figure seen Shaped but in dream on that dim doubtful midnight: Such things had been. . . . So, the well-meaner died While waiting tremulously unsatisfied That no return of the family's foreign scion Would still betide. And many years slid by, And active church-restorers cast their eye Upon the ancient garth and hoary building The tomb stood nigh. And when they had scraped each wall, Pulled out the stately pews, and smartened all, “It will be well,” declared the spruce church-warden, “To overhaul “And broaden this path where shown; Nothing prevents it but an old tombstone Pertaining to a family forgotten, Of deeds unknown. “Their names can scarce be read; Depend on't, all who care for them are dead.” So went the tomb, whose shards were as path-paving Distributed. Over it and about Men's footsteps beat, and wind and waterspout, Until the names, aforetime gnawed by weathers, Were quite worn out. So that no sage can say In pensive progress near where they decay, “This stone records a luminous line whose talents Told in their day.” “REGRET NOT ME” Regret not me; Beneath the sunny tree I lie uncaring, slumbering peacefully. Swift as the light I flew my faery flight; Ecstatically I moved, and feared no night. I did not know That heydays fade and go, But deemed that what was would be always so. I skipped at morn Between the yellowing corn, Thinking it good and glorious to be born. I ran at eves Among the piled-up sheaves, Dreaming, “I grieve not, therefore nothing grieves.” Now soon will come The apple, pear, and plum, And hinds will sing, and autumn insects hum. Again you will fare To cider-makings rare, And junketings; but I shall not be there. Yet gaily sing Until the pewter ring Those songs we sang when we went gipsying. And lightly dance Some triple-timed romance In coupled figures, and forget mischance; And mourn not me Beneath the yellowing tree; For I shall mind not, slumbering peacefully. THE RECALCITRANTS Let us off and search, and find a place Where yours and mine can be natural lives, Where no one comes who dissects and dives And proclaims that ours is a curious case, Which its touch of romance can scarcely grace. You would think it strange at first, but then Everything has been strange in its time. When some one said on a day of the prime He would bow to no brazen god again He doubtless dazed the mass of men. None will see in us a pair whose claims To righteous judgment we care not making; Who have doubted if breath be worth the taking, And have no respect for the current fames Whence the savour has flown while abide the names. We have found us already shunned, disdained, And for re-acceptance have not once striven; Whatever offence our course has given The brunt thereof we have long sustained. Well, let us away, scorned, unexplained. STARLINGS ON THE ROOF “No smoke spreads out of this chimney-pot, The people who lived here have left the spot, And others are coming who knew them not. “If you listen anon, with an ear intent, The voices, you'll find, will be different From the well-known ones of those who went.” “Why did they go? Their tones so bland Were quite familiar to our band; The comers we shall not understand.” “They look for a new life, rich and strange; They do not know that, let them range Wherever they may, they will get no change. “They will drag their house-gear ever so far In their search for a home no miseries mar; They will find that as they were they are, “That every hearth has a ghost, alack, And can be but the scene of a bivouac Till they move their last—no care to pack!” THE MOON LOOKS IN I I have risen again, And awhile survey By my chilly ray Through your window pane Your upturned face, As you think, “Ah—she Now dreams of me In her distant place!” II I pierce her blind In her far-off home: She fixes a comb, And says in her mind, “I start in an hour; Whom shall I meet? Won't the men be sweet, And the women sour!” THE SWEET HUSSY In his early days he was quite surprised When she told him she was compromised By meetings and lingerings at his whim, And thinking not of herself but him; While she lifted orbs aggrieved and round That scandal should so soon abound, (As she had raised them to nine or ten Of antecedent nice young men): And in remorse he thought with a sigh, How good she is, and how bad am I!— It was years before he understood That she was the wicked one—he the good. THE TELEGRAM “O he's suffering—maybe dying—and I not there to aid, And smooth his bed and whisper to him! Can I nohow go? Only the nurse's brief twelve words thus hurriedly conveyed, As by stealth, to let me know. “He was the best and brightest!—candour shone upon his brow, And I shall never meet again a soldier such as he, And I loved him ere I knew it, and perhaps he's sinking now, Far, far removed from me!” —The yachts ride mute at anchor and the fulling moon is fair, And the giddy folk are strutting up and down the smooth parade, And in her wild distraction she seems not to be aware That she lives no more a maid, But has vowed and wived herself to one who blessed the ground she trod To and from his scene of ministry, and thought her history known In its last particular to him—aye, almost as to God, And believed her quite his own. So rapt her mind's far-off regard she droops as in a swoon, And a movement of aversion mars her recent spousal grace, And in silence we two sit here in our waning honeymoon At this idle watering-place. . . . What now I see before me is a long lane overhung With lovelessness, and stretching from the present to the grave. And I would I were away from this, with friends I knew when young, Ere a woman held me slave. THE MOTH-SIGNAL (On Egdon Heath) “What are you still, still thinking,” He asked in vague surmise, “That you stare at the wick unblinking With those deep lost luminous eyes?” “O, I see a poor moth burning In the candle flame,” said she, “Its wings and legs are turning To a cinder rapidly.” “Moths fly in from the heather,” He said, “now the days decline.” “I know,” said she. “The weather, I hope, will at last be fine. “I think,” she added lightly, “I'll look out at the door. The ring the moon wears nightly May be visible now no more.” She rose, and, little heeding, Her life-mate then went on With his mute and museful reading In the annals of ages gone. Outside the house a figure Came from the tumulus near, And speedily waxed bigger, And clasped and called her Dear. “I saw the pale-winged token You sent through the crack,” sighed she. “That moth is burnt and broken With which you lured out me. “And were I as the moth is It might be better far For one whose marriage troth is Shattered as potsherds are!” Then grinned the Ancient Briton From the tumulus treed with pine: “So, hearts are thwartly smitten In these days as in mine!” SEEN BY THE WAITS Through snowy woods and shady We went to play a tune To the lonely manor-lady By the light of the Christmas moon. We violed till, upward glancing To where a mirror leaned, It showed her airily dancing, Deeming her movements screened; Dancing alone in the room there, Thin-draped in her robe of night; Her postures, glassed in the gloom there, Were a strange phantasmal sight. She had learnt (we heard when homing) That her roving spouse was dead: Why she had danced in the gloaming We thought, but never said. THE TWO SOLDIERS Just at the corner of the wall We met—yes, he and I— Who had not faced in camp or hall Since we bade home good-bye, And what once happened came back—all— Out of those years gone by; And that strange woman whom we knew And loved—long dead and gone, Whose poor half-perished residue, Tombless and trod, lay yon. But at this moment to our view Rose like a phantom wan! And in his fixed face I could see, Lit by a lurid shine, The drama re-enact which she Had dyed incarnadine For us, and more. And doubtless he Beheld it too in mine. A start, as at one slightly known; And with an indifferent air We passed, without a sign being shown That, as it real were, A memory-acted scene had thrown Its tragic shadow there. THE DEATH OF REGRET I opened my shutter at sunrise, And looked at the hill hard by, And I heartily grieved for the comrade Who wandered up there to die. I let in the morn on the morrow, And failed not to think of him then, As he trod up that rise in the twilight, And never came down again. I undid the shutter a week thence, But not until after I'd turned Did I call back his last departure By the upland there discerned. Uncovering the casement long later, I bent to my toil till the gray, When I said to myself, “Ah—what ails me, To forget him all the day!” As daily I flung back the shutter In the same blank bald routine, He scarcely once rose to remembrance Through a month of my facing the scene. And ah, seldom now do I ponder At the window as heretofore On the long valued one who died yonder, And wastes by the sycamore. IN THE DAYS OF CRINOLINE A plain tilt-bonnet on her head She took the path across the leaze. —Her spouse the vicar, gardening, said, “Too dowdy that, for coquetries, So I can hoe at ease.” But when she had passed into the heath, And gained the wood beyond the flat, She raised her skirts, and from beneath Unpinned and drew as from a sheath An ostrich-feathered hat. And where the hat had hung she now Concealed and pinned the dowdy hood, And set the hat upon her brow, And thus emerging from the wood Tripped on in jaunty mood. The sun was low and crimson-faced As two came that way from the town, And plunged into the wood untraced. . . . When severally therefrom they paced The sun had quite gone down. The hat and feather disappeared, The dowdy hood again was donned, And in the gloom the fair one neared Her home and husband dour, who conned Calmly his blue-eyed blonde. “To-day,” he said, “you have shown good sense, A dress so modest and so meek Should always deck your goings hence Alone.” And as a recompense He kissed her on the cheek. THE ROMAN GRAVEMOUNDS By Rome's dim relics there walks a man, Eyes bent; and he carries a basket and spade; I guess what impels him to scrape and scan; Yea, his dreams of that Empire long decayed. “Vast was Rome,” he must muse, “in the world's regard, Vast it looms there still, vast it ever will be”; And he stoops as to dig and unmine some shard Left by those who are held in such memory. But no; in his basket, see, he has brought A little white furred thing, stiff of limb, Whose life never won from the world a thought; It is this, and not Rome, that is moving him. And to make it a grave he has come to the spot, And he delves in the ancient dead's long home; Their fames, their achievements, the man knows not; The furred thing is all to him—nothing Rome! “Here say you that Cæsar's warriors lie?— But my little white cat was my only friend! Could she but live, might the record die Of Cæsar, his legions, his aims, his end!” Well, Rome's long rule here is oft and again A theme for the sages of history, And the small furred life was worth no one's pen; Yet its mourner's mood has a charm for me. November 1910. THE WORKBOX “See, here's the workbox, little wife, That I made of polished oak.” He was a joiner, of village life; She came of borough folk. He holds the present up to her As with a smile she nears And answers to the profferer, “'Twill last all my sewing years!” “I warrant it will. And longer too. 'Tis a scantling that I got Off poor John Wayward's coffin, who Died of they knew not what. “The shingled pattern that seems to cease Against your box's rim Continues right on in the piece That's underground with him. “And while I worked it made me think Of timber's varied doom; One inch where people eat and drink, The next inch in a tomb. “But why do you look so white, my dear, And turn aside your face? You knew not that good lad, I fear, Though he came from your native place?” “How could I know that good young man, Though he came from my native town, When he must have left far earlier than I was a woman grown?” “Ah, no. I should have understood! It shocked you that I gave To you one end of a piece of wood Whose other is in a grave?” “Don't, dear, despise my intellect, Mere accidental things Of that sort never have effect On my imaginings.” Yet still her lips were limp and wan, Her face still held aside, As if she had known not only John, But known of what he died. THE SACRILEGE A BALLAD-TRAGEDY (Circa 182?) Part I “I have a Love I love too well Where Dunkery frowns on Exon Moor; I have a Love I love too well, To whom, ere she was mine, ‘Such is my love for you,’ I said, ‘That you shall have to hood your head A silken kerchief crimson-red, Wove finest of the fine.’ “And since this Love, for one mad moon, On Exon Wild by Dunkery Tor, Since this my Love for one mad moon Did clasp me as her king, I snatched a silk-piece red and rare From off a stall at Priddy Fair, For handkerchief to hood her hair When we went gallanting. “Full soon the four weeks neared their end Where Dunkery frowns on Exon Moor; And when the four weeks neared their end, And their swift sweets outwore, I said, ‘What shall I do to own Those beauties bright as tulips blown, And keep you here with me alone As mine for evermore?’ “And as she drowsed within my van On Exon Wild by Dunkery Tor— And as she drowsed within my van, And dawning turned to day, She heavily raised her sloe-back eyes And murmured back in softest wise, ‘One more thing, and the charms you prize Are yours henceforth for aye. “‘And swear I will I'll never go While Dunkery frowns on Exon Moor To meet the Cornish Wrestler Joe For dance and dallyings. If you'll to yon cathedral shrine, And finger from the chest divine Treasure to buy me ear-drops fine, And richly jewelled rings.’ “I said: ‘I am one who has gathered gear From Marlbury Downs to Dunkery Tor, Who has gathered gear for many a year From mansion, mart and fair; But at God's house I've stayed my hand, Hearing within me some command— Curbed by a law not of the land From doing damage there!’ “Whereat she pouts, this Love of mine, As Dunkery pouts to Exon Moor, And still she pouts, this Love of mine, So cityward I go. But ere I start to do the thing, And speed my soul's imperilling For one who is my ravishing And all the joy I know, “I come to lay this charge on thee— On Exon Wild by Dunkery Tor— I come to lay this charge on thee With solemn speech and sign: Should things go ill, and my life pay For botchery in this rash assay, You are to take hers likewise—yea, The month the law takes mine. “For should my rival, Wrestler Joe, Where Dunkery frowns on Exon Moor— My reckless rival, Wrestler Joe, My Love's bedwinner be, My rafted spirit would not rest, But wander weary and distrest Throughout the world in wild protest: The thought nigh maddens me!” Part II Thus did he speak—this brother of mine— On Exon Wild by Dunkery Tor, Born at my birth of mother of mine, And forthwith went his way To dare the deed some coming night . . . I kept the watch with shaking sight, The moon at moments breaking bright, At others glooming gray. For three full days I heard no sound Where Dunkery frowns on Exon Moor, I heard no sound at all around Whether his fay prevailed, Or one more foul the master were, Till some afoot did tidings bear How that, for all his practised care, He had been caught and jailed. They had heard a crash when twelve had chimed By Mendip east of Dunkery Tor, When twelve had chimed and moonlight climbed; They watched, and he was tracked By arch and aisle and saint and knight Of sculptured stonework sheeted white In the cathedral's ghostly light, And captured in the act. Yes; for this Love he loved too well Where Dunkery sights the Severn shore, All for this Love he loved too well He burst the holy bars, Seized golden vessels from the chest To buy her ornaments of the best, At her ill-witchery's request And lure of eyes like stars. . . . When blustering March confused the sky In Toneborough Town by Exon Moor, When blustering March confused the sky They stretched him; and he died. Down in the crowd where I, to see The end of him, stood silently, With a set face he lipped to me— “Remember.” “Ay!” I cried. By night and day I shadowed her From Toneborough Deane to Dunkery Tor, I shadowed her asleep, astir, And yet I could not bear— Till Wrestler Joe anon began To figure as her chosen man, And took her to his shining van— To doom a form so fair! He made it handsome for her sake— And Dunkery smiled to Exon Moor— He made it handsome for her sake, Painting it out and in; And on the door of apple-green A bright brass knocker soon was seen, And window-curtains white and clean For her to sit within. And all could see she clave to him As cleaves a cloud to Dunkery Tor, Yea, all could see she clave to him, And every day I said, “A pity it seems to part those two That hourly grow to love more true: Yet she's the wanton woman who Sent one to swing till dead!” That blew to blazing all my hate, While Dunkery frowned on Exon Moor, And when the river swelled, her fate Came to her pitilessly. . . . I dogged her, crying: “Across that plank They use as bridge to reach yon bank A coat and hat lie limp and dank; Your goodman's, can they be?” She paled, and went, I close behind— And Exon frowned to Dunkery Tor, She went, and I came up behind And tipped the plank that bore Her, fleetly flitting across to eye What such might bode. She slid awry; And from the current came a cry, A gurgle; and no more. How that befell no mortal knew From Marlbury Downs to Exon Moor; No mortal knew that deed undue But he who schemed the crime, Which night still covers. . . . But in dream Those ropes of hair upon the stream He sees, and he will hear that scream Until his judgment-time. THE ABBEY MASON INVENTOR OF THE “PERPENDICULAR” STYLE OF GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE (With Memories of John Hicks, Architect) The new-vamped Abbey shaped apace In the fourteenth century of grace; (The church which, at an after date, Acquired cathedral rank and state.) Panel and circumscribing wall Of latest feature, trim and tall, Rose roundabout the Norman core In prouder pose than theretofore, Encasing magically the old With parpend ashlars manifold. The trowels rang out, and tracery Appeared where blanks had used to be. Men toiled for pleasure more than pay, And all went smoothly day by day, Till, in due course, the transept part Engrossed the master-mason's art. —Home-coming thence he tossed and turned Throughout the night till the new sun burned. “What fearful visions have inspired These gaingivings?” his wife inquired; “As if your tools were in your hand You have hammered, fitted, muttered, planned; “You have thumped as you were working hard: I might have found me bruised and scarred. “What then's amiss? What eating care Looms nigh, whereof I am unaware?” He answered not, but churchward went, Viewing his draughts with discontent; And fumbled there the livelong day Till, hollow-eyed, he came away. —'Twas said, “The master-mason's ill!” And all the abbey works stood still. Quoth Abbot Wygmore: “Why, O why Distress yourself? You'll surely die!” The mason answered, trouble-torn, “This long-vogued style is quite outworn! “The upper archmould nohow serves To meet the lower tracery curves: “The ogees bend too far away To give the flexures interplay. “This it is causes my distress. . . . So it will ever be unless “New forms be found to supersede The circle when occasions need. “To carry it out I have tried and toiled, And now perforce must own me foiled! “Jeerers will say: ‘Here was a man Who could not end what he began!’” —So passed that day, the next, the next; The abbot scanned the task, perplexed; The townsmen mustered all their wit To fathom how to compass it, But no raw artistries availed Where practice in the craft had failed. . . . —One night he tossed, all open-eyed, And early left his helpmeet's side. Scattering the rushes of the floor He wandered from the chamber door And sought the sizing pile, whereon Struck dimly a cadaverous dawn Through freezing rain, that drenched the board Of diagram-lines he last had scored— Chalked phantasies in vain begot To knife the architectural knot— In front of which he dully stood, Regarding them in hopeless mood. He closelier looked; then looked again: The chalk-scratched draught-board faced the rain, Whose icicled drops deformed the lines Innumerous of his lame designs, So that they streamed in small white threads From the upper segments to the heads Of arcs below, uniting them Each by a stalactitic stem. —At once, with eyes that struck out sparks, He adds accessory cusping-marks, Then laughs aloud. The thing was done So long assayed from sun to sun. . . . —Now in his joy he grew aware Of one behind him standing there, And, turning, saw the abbot, who The weather's whim was watching too. Onward to Prime the abbot went, Tacit upon the incident. —Men now discerned as days revolved The ogive riddle had been solved; Templates were cut, fresh lines were chalked Where lines had been defaced and balked, And the work swelled and mounted higher, Achievement distancing desire; Here jambs with transoms fixed between, Where never the like before had been— There little mullions thinly sawn Where meeting circles once were drawn. “We knew,” men said, “the thing would go After his craft-wit got aglow, “And, once fulfilled what he has designed, We'll honour him and his great mind!” When matters stood thus poised awhile, And all surroundings shed a smile, The master-mason on an eve Homed to his wife and seemed to grieve. . . . —“The abbot spoke to me to-day; He hangs about the works alway. “He knows the source as well as I Of the new style men magnify. “He said: ‘You pride yourself too much On your creation. Is it such? “‘Surely the hand of God it is That conjured so, and only His!— “‘Disclosing by the frost and rain Forms your invention chased in vain; “‘Hence the devices deemed so great You copied, and did not create.’ “I feel the abbot's words are just, And that all thanks renounce I must. “Can a man welcome praise and pelf For hatching art that hatched itself? . . . “So, I shall own the deft design Is Heaven's outshaping, and not mine.” “What!” said she. “Praise your works ensure To throw away, and quite obscure “Your beaming and beneficent star? Better you leave things as they are! “Why, think awhile. Had not your zest In your loved craft curtailed your rest— “Had you not gone there ere the day The sun had melted all away!” —But, though his good wife argued so, The mason let the people know That not unaided sprang the thought Whereby the glorious fane was wrought, But that by frost when dawn was dim The method was disclosed to him. “Yet,” said the townspeople thereat, “'Tis your own doing, even with that!” But he—chafed, childlike, in extremes— The temperament of men of dreams— Aloofly scrupled to admit That he did aught but borrow it, And diffidently made request That with the abbot all should rest. —As none could doubt the abbot's word, Or question what the church averred, The mason was at length believed Of no more count than he conceived, And soon began to lose the fame That late had gathered round his name. . . —Time passed, and like a living thing The pile went on embodying, And workmen died, and young ones grew, And the old mason sank from view And Abbots Wygmore and Staunton went And Horton sped the embellishment. But not till years had far progressed Chanced it that, one day, much impressed, Standing within the well-graced aisle, He asked who first conceived the style; And some decrepit sage detailed How, when invention nought availed, The cloud-cast waters in their whim Came down, and gave the hint to him Who struck each arc, and made each mould; And how the abbot would not hold As sole begetter him who applied Forms the Almighty sent as guide; And how the master lost renown, And wore in death no artist's crown. —Then Horton, who in inner thought Had more perceptions than he taught, Replied: “Nay; art can but transmute; Invention is not absolute; “Things fail to spring from nought at call, And art-beginnings most of all. “He did but what all artists do, Wait upon Nature for his cue.” —“Had you been here to tell them so, Lord Abbot, sixty years ago, “The mason, now long underground, Doubtless a different fate had found. “He passed into oblivion dim, And none knew what became of him! “His name? 'Twas of some common kind And now has faded out of mind.” The Abbot: “It shall not be hid! I'll trace it.” . . . But he never did. —When longer yet dank death had wormed The brain wherein the style had germed From Gloucester church it flew afar— The style called Perpendicular.— To Winton and to Westminster It ranged, and grew still beautifuller: From Solway Frith to Dover Strand Its fascinations starred the land, Not only on cathedral walls But upon courts and castle halls, Till every edifice in the isle Was patterned to no other style, And till, long having played its part The curtain fell on Gothic art. —Well: when in Wessex on your rounds, Take a brief step beyond its bounds, And enter Gloucester: seek the quoin Where choir and transept interjoin, And, gazing at the forms there flung Against the sky by one unsung— The ogee arches transom-topped, The tracery-stalks by spandrels stopped, Petrified lacework—lightly lined On ancient massiveness behind— Muse that some minds so modest be As to renounce fame's fairest fee, (Like him who crystallized on this spot His visionings, but lies forgot, And many a mediaeval one Whose symmetries salute the sun) While others boom a baseless claim, And upon nothing rear a name. THE JUBILEE OF A MAGAZINE (To the Editor) Yes; your up-dated modern page— All flower-fresh, as it appears— Can claim a time-tried lineage, That reaches backward fifty years (Which, if but short for sleepy squires, Is much in magazines' careers). —Here, on your cover, never tires The sower, reaper, thresher, while As through the seasons of our sires Each wills to work in ancient style With seedlip, sickle, share and flail, Though modes have since moved many a mile! The steel-roped plough now rips the vale, With cog and tooth the sheaves are won, Wired wheels drum out the wheat like hail; But if we ask, what has been done To unify the mortal lot Since your bright leaves first saw the sun, Beyond mechanic furtherance—what Advance can rightness, candour, claim? Truth bends abashed, and answers not. Despite your volumes' gentle aim To straighten visions wry and wrong, Events jar onward much the same! —Had custom tended to prolong, As on your golden page engrained, Old processes of blade and prong, And best invention been retained For high crusades to lessen tears Throughout the race, the world had gained! . . . But too much, this, for fifty years. THE SATIN SHOES “If ever I walk to church to wed, As other maidens use, And face the gathered eyes,” she said “I'll go in satin shoes!” She was as fair as early day Shining on meads unmown, And her sweet syllables seemed to play Like flute-notes softly blown. The time arrived when it was meet That she should be a bride; The satin shoes were on her feet, Her father was at her side. They stood within the dairy door, And gazed across the green; The church loomed on the distant moor, But rain was thick between. “The grass-path hardly can be stepped, The lane is like a pool!”— Her dream is shown to be inept, Her wish they overrule. “To go forth shod in satin soft A coach would be required!” For thickest boots the shoes were doffed— Those shoes her soul desired. . . . All day the bride, as overborne, Was seen to brood apart, And that the shoes had not been worn Sat heavy on her heart. From her wrecked dream, as months flew on, Her thought seemed not to range. “What ails the wife,” they said anon, “That she should be so strange?” . . . Ah—what coach comes with furtive glide— A coach of closed-up kind? It comes to fetch the last year's bride, Who wanders in her mind. She strove with them, and fearfully ran Stairward with one low scream: “Nay—coax her,” said the madhouse man, “With some old household theme.” “If you will go, dear, you must fain Put on those shoes—the pair Meant for your marriage, which the rain Forbade you then to wear.” She clapped her hands, flushed joyous hues; “O yes—I'll up and ride If I am to wear my satin shoes And be a proper bride!” Out then her little foot held she, As to depart with speed; The madhouse man smiled pleasantly To see the wile succeed. She turned to him when all was done, And gave him her thin hand, Exclaiming like an enraptured one, “This time it will be grand!” She mounted with a face elate, Shut was the carriage door; They drove her to the madhouse gate, And she was seen no more. . . . Yet she was fair as early day Shining on meads unmown, And her sweet syllables seemed to play Like flute-notes softly blown. EXEUNT OMNES I Everybody else, then, going, And I still left where the fair was? . . . Much have I seen of neighbour loungers Making a lusty showing, Each now past all knowing. II There is an air of blankness In the street and the littered spaces; Thoroughfare, steeple, bridge and highway Wizen themselves to lankness; Kennels dribble dankness. III Folk all fade. And whither, As I wait alone where the fair was? Into the clammy and numbing night-fog Whence they entered hither. Soon one more goes thither! June 2, 1913. A POET Attentive eyes, fantastic heed, Assessing minds, he does not need, Nor urgent writs to sup or dine, Nor pledges in the rosy wine. For loud acclaim he does not care By the august or rich or fair, Nor for smart pilgrims from afar, Curious on where his hauntings are. But soon or later, when you hear That he has doffed this wrinkled gear, Some evening, at the first star-ray, Come to his graveside, pause and say: “Whatever his message—glad or grim— Two bright-souled women clave to him”; Stand and say that while day decays; It will be word enough of praise. July 1914. SATIRES OF CIRCUMSTANCE IN FIFTEEN GLIMPSES (First published April 1911) I AT TEA The kettle descants in a cosy drone, And the young wife looks in her husband's face, And then at her guest's, and shows in her own Her sense that she fills an envied place; And the visiting lady is all abloom, And says there was never so sweet a room. And the happy young housewife does not know That the woman beside her was first his choice, Till the fates ordained it could not be so. . . . Betraying nothing in look or voice The guest sits smiling and sips her tea, And he throws her a stray glance yearningly. II IN CHURCH “And now to God the Father,” he ends, And his voice thrills up to the topmost tiles: Each listener chokes as he bows and bends, And emotion pervades the crowded aisles. Then the preacher glides to the vestry-door, And shuts it, and thinks he is seen no more. The door swings softly ajar meanwhile, And a pupil of his in the Bible class, Who adores him as one without gloss or guile, Sees her idol stand with a satisfied smile And re-enact at the vestry-glass Each pulpit gesture in deft dumb-show That had moved the congregation so. III BY HER AUNT'S GRAVE “Sixpence a week,” says the girl to her lover, “Aunt used to bring me, for she could confide In me alone, she vowed. 'Twas to cover The cost of her headstone when she died. And that was a year ago last June; I've not yet fixed it. But I must soon.” “And where is the money now, my dear?” “O, snug in my purse . . . Aunt was so slow In saving it—eighty weeks, or near.” . . . “Let's spend it,” he hints. “For she won't know There's a dance to-night at the Load of Hay.” She passively nods. And they go that way. IV IN THE ROOM OF THE BRIDE-ELECT “Would it had been the man of our wish!” Sighs her mother. To whom with vehemence she In the wedding-dress—the wife to be— “Then why were you so mollyish As not to insist on him for me!” The mother, amazed: “Why, dearest one, Because you pleaded for this or none!” “But Father and you should have stood out strong! Since then, to my cost, I have lived to find That you were right and that I was wrong; This man is a dolt to the one declined. . . . Ah!—here he comes with his button-hole rose. Good God—I must marry him I suppose!” V AT A WATERING-PLACE They sit and smoke on the esplanade, The man and his friend, and regard the bay Where the far chalk cliffs, to the left displayed, Smile sallowly in the decline of day. And saunterers pass with laugh and jest— A handsome couple among the rest. “That smart proud pair,” says the man to his friend, “Are to marry next week. . . . How little he thinks That dozens of days and nights on end I have stroked her neck, unhooked the links Of her sleeve to get at her upper arm. . . . Well, bliss is in ignorance: what's the harm!” VI IN THE CEMETERY “You see those mothers squabbling there?” Remarks the man of the cemetery. “One says in tears, ‘'Tis mine lies here!’ Another, ‘Nay, mine, you Pharisee!’ Another, ‘How dare you move my flowers And put your own on this grave of ours!’ But all their children were laid therein At different times, like sprats in a tin. “And then the main drain had to cross, And we moved the lot some nights ago, And packed them away in the general foss With hundreds more. But their folks don't know, And as well cry over a new-laid drain As anything else, to ease your pain!” VII OUTSIDE THE WINDOW “My stick!” he says, and turns in the lane To the house just left, whence a vixen voice Comes out with the firelight through the pane, And he sees within that the girl of his choice Stands rating her mother with eyes aglare For something said while he was there. “At last I behold her soul undraped!” Thinks the man who had loved her more than himself; “My God!—'tis but narrowly I have escaped.— My precious porcelain proves it delf.” His face has reddened like one ashamed, And he steals off, leaving his stick unclaimed. VIII IN THE STUDY He enters, and mute on the edge of a chair Sits a thin-faced lady, a stranger there, A type of decayed gentility; And by some small signs he well can guess That she comes to him almost breakfastless. “I have called—I hope I do not err— I am looking for a purchaser Of some score volumes of the works Of eminent divines I own,— Left by my father—though it irks My patience to offer them.” And she smiles As if necessity were unknown; “But the truth of it is that oftenwhiles I have wished, as I am fond of art, To make my rooms a little smart, And these old books are so in the way.” And lightly still she laughs to him, As if to sell were a mere gay whim, And that, to be frank, Life were indeed To her not vinegar and gall, But fresh and honey-like; and Need No household skeleton at all. IX AT THE ALTAR-RAIL “My bride is not coming, alas!” says the groom, And the telegram shakes in his hand. “I own It was hurried! We met at a dancing-room When I went to the Cattle-Show alone, And then, next night, where the Fountain leaps, And the Street of the Quarter-Circle sweeps. “Ay, she won me to ask her to be my wife— 'Twas foolish perhaps!—to forsake the ways Of the flaring town for a farmer's life. She agreed. And we fixed it. Now she says: ‘It's sweet of you, dear, to prepare me a nest, But a swift, short, gay life suits me best. What I really am you have never gleaned; I had eaten the apple ere you were weaned.’” X IN THE NUPTIAL CHAMBER “O that mastering tune!” And up in the bed Like a lace-robed phantom springs the bride; “And why?” asks the man she had that day wed, With a start, as the band plays on outside. “It's the townsfolk's cheery compliment Because of our marriage, my Innocent.” “O but you don't know! 'Tis the passionate air To which my old Love waltzed with me, And I swore as we spun that none should share My home, my kisses, till death, save he! And he dominates me and thrills me through, And it's he I embrace while embracing you!” XI IN THE RESTAURANT “But hear. If you stay, and the child be born, It will pass as your husband's with the rest, While, if we fly, the teeth of scorn Will be gleaming at us from east to west; And the child will come as a life despised; I feel an elopement is ill-advised!” “O you realize not what it is, my dear, To a woman! Daily and hourly alarms Lest the truth should out. How can I stay here And nightly take him into my arms! Come to the child no name or fame, Let us go, and face it, and bear the shame.” XII AT THE DRAPER'S “I stood at the back of the shop, my dear, But you did not perceive me. Well, when they deliver what you were shown I shall know nothing of it, believe me!” And he coughed and coughed as she paled and said, “O, I didn't see you come in there— Why couldn't you speak?”—“Well, I didn't. I left That you should not notice I'd been there. “You were viewing some lovely things. ‘Soon required For a widow, of latest fashion’; And I knew 'twould upset you to meet the man Who had to be cold and ashen “And screwed in a box before they could dress you ‘In the last new note in mourning,’ As they defined it. So, not to distress you, I left you to your adorning.” XIII ON THE DEATH-BED “I'll tell—being past all praying for— Then promptly die . . . He was out at the war, And got some scent of the intimacy That was under way between her and me; And he stole back home, and appeared like a ghost One night, at the very time almost That I reached her house. Well, I shot him dead, And secretly buried him. Nothing was said. “The news of the battle came next day; He was scheduled missing. I hurried away, Got out there, visited the field, And sent home word that a search revealed He was one of the slain; though, lying alone And stript, his body had not been known. “But she suspected. I lost her love, Yea, my hope of earth, and of Heaven above; And my time's now come, and I'll pay the score, Though it be burning for evermore.” XIV OVER THE COFFIN They stand confronting, the coffin between, His wife of old, and his wife of late, And the dead man whose they both had been Seems listening aloof, as to things past date. —“I have called,” says the first. “Do you marvel or not?” “In truth,” says the second, “I do—somewhat.” “Well, there was a word to be said by me! . . . I divorced that man because of you— It seemed I must do it, boundenly; But now I am older, and tell you true, For life is little, and dead lies he; I would I had let alone you two! And both of us, scorning parochial ways, Had lived like the wives in the patriarchs' days.” XV IN THE MOONLIGHT “O lonely workman, standing there In a dream, why do you stare and stare At her grave, as no other grave there were? “If your great gaunt eyes so importune Her soul by the shine of this corpse-cold moon, Maybe you'll raise her phantom soon!” “Why, fool, it is what I would rather see Than all the living folk there be; But alas, there is no such joy for me!” “Ah—she was one you loved, no doubt, Through good and evil, through rain and drought, And when she passed, all your sun went out?” “Nay: she was the woman I did not love, Whom all the others were ranked above, Whom during her life I thought nothing of.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MOMENTS OF VISION AND MISCELLANEOUS VERSES MOMENTS OF VISION That mirror Which makes of men a transparency, Who holds that mirror And bids us such a breast-bare spectacle see Of you and me? That mirror Whose magic penetrates like a dart, Who lifts that mirror And throws our mind back on us, and our heart, Until we start? That mirror Works well in these night hours of ache; Why in that mirror Are tincts we never see ourselves once take When the world is awake? That mirror Can test each mortal when unaware; Yea, that strange mirror May catch his last thoughts, whole life foul or fair, Glassing it—where? THE VOICE OF THINGS Forty Augusts—aye, and several more—ago, When I paced the headlands loosed from dull employ, The waves huzza'd like a multitude below In the sway of an all-including joy Without cloy. Blankly I walked there a double decade after, When thwarts had flung their toils in front of me, And I heard the waters wagging in a long ironic laughter At the lot of men, and all the vapoury Things that be. Wheeling change has set me again standing where Once I heard the waves huzza at Lammas-tide; But they supplicate now—like a congregation there Who murmur the Confession—I outside, Prayer denied. “WHY BE AT PAINS?” (Wooer's Song) Why be at pains that I should know You sought not me? Do breezes, then, make features glow So rosily? Come, the lit port is at our back, And the tumbling sea; Elsewhere the lampless uphill track To uncertainty! O should not we two waifs join hands? I am alone, You would enrich me more than lands By being my own. Yet, though this facile moment flies, Close is your tone, And ere to-morrow's dewfall dries I plough the unknown. “WE SAT AT THE WINDOW” (Bournemouth, 1875) We sat at the window looking out, And the rain came down like silken strings That Swithin's day. Each gutter and spout Babbled unchecked in the busy way Of witless things: Nothing to read, nothing to see Seemed in that room for her and me On Swithin's day. We were irked by the scene, by our own selves; yes, For I did not know, nor did she infer How much there was to read and guess By her in me, and to see and crown By me in her. Wasted were two souls in their prime, And great was the waste, that July time When the rain came down. AFTERNOON SERVICE AT MELLSTOCK (Circa 1850) On afternoons of drowsy calm We stood in the panelled pew, Singing one-voiced a Tate-and-Brady psalm To the tune of “Cambridge New.” We watched the elms, we watched the rooks, The clouds upon the breeze, Between the whiles of glancing at our books, And swaying like the trees. So mindless were those outpourings!— Though I am not aware That I have gained by subtle thought on things Since we stood psalming there. AT THE WICKET-GATE There floated the sounds of church-chiming, But no one was nigh, Till there came, as a break in the loneness, Her father, she, I. And we slowly moved on to the wicket, And downlooking stood, Till anon people passed, and amid them We parted for good. Greater, wiser, may part there than we three Who parted there then, But never will Fates colder-featured Hold sway there again. Of the churchgoers through the still meadows No single one knew What a play was played under their eyes there As thence we withdrew. IN A MUSEUM I Here's the mould of a musical bird long passed from light, Which over the earth before man came was winging; There's a contralto voice I heard last night, That lodges in me still with its sweet singing. II Such a dream is Time that the coo of this ancient bird Has perished not, but is blent, or will be blending Mid visionless wilds of space with the voice that I heard, In the full-fugued song of the universe unending. Exeter. APOSTROPHE TO AN OLD PSALM TUNE I met you first—ah, when did I first meet you? When I was full of wonder, and innocent, Standing meek-eyed with those of choric bent, While dimming day grew dimmer In the pulpit-glimmer. Much riper in years I met you—in a temple Where summer sunset streamed upon our shapes, And you spread over me like a gauze that drapes, And flapped from floor to rafters, Sweet as angels' laughters. But you had been stripped of some of your old vesture By Monk, or another. Now you wore no frill, And at first you startled me. But I knew you still, Though I missed the minim's waver, And the dotted quaver. I grew accustomed to you thus. And you hailed me Through one who evoked you often. Then at last Your raiser was borne off, and I mourned you had passed From my life with your late outsetter; Till I said, “'Tis better!” But you waylaid me. I rose and went as a ghost goes, And said, eyes-full: “I'll never hear it again! It is overmuch for scathed and memoried men When sitting among strange people Under their steeple.” Now, a new stirrer of tones calls you up before me And wakes your speech, as she of Endor did (When sought by Saul who, in disguises hid, Fell down on the earth to hear it) Samuel's spirit. So, your quired oracles beat till they make me tremble As I discern your mien in the old attire, Here in these turmoiled years of belligerent fire Living still on—and onward, maybe, Till Doom's great day be! Sunday, August 13, 1916. AT THE WORD “FAREWELL” She looked like a bird from a cloud On the clammy lawn, Moving alone, bare-browed In the dim of dawn. The candles alight in the room For my parting meal Made all things withoutdoors loom Strange, ghostly, unreal. The hour itself was a ghost, And it seemed to me then As of chances the chance furthermost I should see her again. I beheld not where all was so fleet That a Plan of the past Which had ruled us from birthtime to meet Was in working at last: No prelude did I there perceive To a drama at all, Or foreshadow what fortune might weave From beginnings so small; But I rose as if quicked by a spur I was bound to obey, And stepped through the casement to her Still alone in the gray. “I am leaving you. . . . Farewell!” I said As I followed her on By an alley bare boughs overspread; “I soon must be gone!” Even then the scale might have been turned Against love by a feather, —But crimson one cheek of hers burned When we came in together. FIRST SIGHT OF HER AND AFTER A day is drawing to its fall I had not dreamed to see; The first of many to enthrall My spirit, will it be? Or is this eve the end of all Such new delight for me? I journey home: the pattern grows Of moonshades on the way: “Soon the first quarter, I suppose,” Sky-glancing travellers say; I realize that it, for those, Has been a common day. THE RIVAL I determined to find out whose it was— The portrait he looked at so, and sighed; Bitterly have I rued my meanness And wept for it since he died! I searched his desk when he was away, And there was the likeness—yes, my own! Taken when I was the season's fairest, And time-lines all unknown. I smiled at my image, and put it back, And he went on cherishing it, until I was chafed that he loved not the me then living, But that past woman still. Well, such was my jealousy at last, I destroyed that face of the former me; Could you ever have dreamed the heart of woman Would work so foolishly! HEREDITY I am the family face; Flesh perishes, I live on, Projecting trait and trace Through time to times anon, And leaping from place to place Over oblivion. The years-heired feature that can In curve and voice and eye Despise the human span Of durance—that is I; The eternal thing in man, That heeds no call to die. “YOU WERE THE SORT THAT MEN FORGET” You were the sort that men forget; Though I—not yet!— Perhaps not ever. Your slighted weakness Adds to the strength of my regret! You'd not the art—you never had For good or bad— To make men see how sweet your meaning, Which, visible, had charmed them glad. You would, by words inept let fall, Offend them all, Even if they saw your warm devotion Would hold your life's blood at their call. . You lacked the eye to understand Those friends offhand Whose mode was crude, though whose dim purport Outpriced the courtesies of the bland. I am now the only being who Remembers you It may be. What a waste that Nature Grudged soul so dear the art its due! SHE, I, AND THEY I was sitting, She was knitting, And the portraits of our fore-folk hung around; When there struck on us a sigh; “Ah—what is that?” said I: “Was it not you?” said she. “A sigh did sound.“ I had not breathed it, Nor the night-wind heaved it, And how it came to us we could not guess; And we looked up at each face Framed and glazed there in its place, Still hearkening; but thenceforth was silentness. Half in dreaming, “Then its meaning,” Said we, “must be surely this; that they repine That we should be the last Of stocks once unsurpassed, And unable to keep up their sturdy line.” 1916. NEAR LANIVET, 1872 There was a stunted handpost just on the crest, Only a few feet high: She was tired, and we stopped in the twilight-time for her rest, At the crossways close thereby. She leant back, being so weary, against its stem, And laid her arms on its own, Each open palm stretched out to each end of them, Her sad face sideways thrown. Her white-clothed form at this dim-lit cease of day Made her look as one crucified In my gaze at her from the midst of the dusty way, And hurriedly “Don't,” I cried. I do not think she heard. Loosing thence she said, As she stepped forth ready to go, “I am rested now.—Something strange came into my head, I wish I had not leant so!” And wordless we moved onward down from the hill In the west cloud's murked obscure, And looking back we could see the handpost still In the solitude of the moor. “It struck her too,” I thought, for as if afraid She heavily breathed as we trailed; Till she said, “I did not think how 'twould look in the shade, When I leant there like one nailed.” I, lightly: “There's nothing in it. For you, anyhow!” —“O I know there is not,” said she. . . “Yet I wonder . . . If no one is bodily crucified now, In spirit one may be!” And we dragged on and on, while we seemed to see In the running of Time's far glass Her crucified, as she had wondered if she might be Some day.—Alas, alas! JOYS OF MEMORY When the spring comes round, and a certain day Looks out from the brume by the eastern copsetrees And says, Remember, I begin again, as if it were new, A day of like date I once lived through, Whiling it hour by hour away; So shall I do till my December, When spring comes round. I take my holiday then and my rest Away from the dun life here about me, Old hours re-greeting With the quiet sense that bring they must Such throbs as at first, till I house with dust. And in the numbness my heartsome zest For things that were, be past repeating When spring comes round. TO THE MOON “What have you looked at, Moon. In your time, Now long past your prime?” “O, I have looked at, often looked at Sweet, sublime, Sore things, shudderful, night and noon In my time.” “What have you mused on, Moon, In your day, So aloof, so far away?” “O, I have mused on, often mused on Growth, decay, Nations alive, dead, mad, aswoon, In my day!” “Have you much wondered, Moon, On your rounds, Self-wrapt, beyond Earth's bounds?” “Yea, I have wondered, often wondered At the sounds Reaching me of the human tune On my rounds.” “What do you think of it, Moon, As you go? Is Life much, or no?” “O, I think of it, often think of it As a show God ought surely to shut up soon, As I go.” COPYING ARCHITECTURE IN AN OLD MINSTER (Wimborne) How smartly the quarters of the hour march by That the jack-o'-clock never forgets; Ding-dong; and before I have traced a cusp's eye, Or got the true twist of the ogee over, A double ding-dong ricochetts. Just so did he clang here before I came, And so will he clang when I'm gone Through the Minster's cavernous hollows—the same Tale of hours never more to be will he deliver To the speechless midnight and dawn. I grow to conceive it a call to ghosts, Whose mould lies below and around. Yes; the next “Come, come,” draws them out from their posts, And they gather, and one shade appears, and another, As the eve-damps creep from the ground. See—a Courtenay stands by his quatre-foiled tomb, And a Duke and his Duchess near; And one Sir Edmund in columned gloom, And a Saxon king by the presbytery chamber; And shapes unknown in the rear. Maybe they have met for a parle on some plan To better ail-stricken mankind; I catch their cheepings, though thinner than The overhead creak of a passager's pinion When leaving land behind. Or perhaps they speak to the yet unborn, And caution them not to come To a world so ancient and trouble-torn, Of foiled intents, vain lovingkindness, And ardours chilled and numb. They waste to fog as I stir and stand, And move from the arched recess, And pick up the drawing that slipped from my hand, And feel for the pencil I dropped in the cranny In a moment's forgetfulness. TO SHAKESPEARE AFTER THREE HUNDRED YEARS Bright baffling Soul, least capturable of themes, Thou, who display'dst a life of commonplace, Leaving no intimate word or personal trace Of high design outside the artistry Of thy penned dreams, Still shalt remain at heart unread eternally. Through human orbits thy discourse to-day, Despite thy formal pilgrimage, throbs on In harmonies that cow Oblivion, And, like the wind, with all-uncared effect Maintain a sway Not fore-desired, in tracks unchosen and unchecked. And yet, at thy last breath, with mindless note The borough clocks but samely tongued the hour The Avon just as always glassed the tower, Thy age was published on thy passing-bell But in due rote With other dwellers' deaths accorded a like knell. And at the strokes some townsman (met, maybe, And thereon queried by some squire's good dame Driving in shopward) may have given thy name, With, “Yes, a worthy man and well-to-do; Though, as for me, I knew him but by just a neighbour's nod, 'tis true. “I'faith, few knew him much here, save by word, He having elsewhere led his busier life; Though to be sure he left with us his wife.” —“Ah, one of the tradesmen's sons, I now recall. . . . Witty, I've heard. . . . We did not know him. . . . Well, good-day. Death comes to all.” So, like a strange bright bird we sometimes find To mingle with the barn-door brood awhile, Then vanish from their homely domicile— Into man's poesy, we wot not whence, Flew thy strange mind, Lodged there a radiant guest, and sped for ever thence. 1916. QUID HIC AGIS? I When I weekly knew An ancient pew, And murmured there The forms of prayer And thanks and praise In the ancient ways, And heard read out During August drought That chapter from Kings Harvest-time brings; —How the prophet, broken By griefs unspoken, Went heavily away To fast and to pray, And, while waiting to die, The Lord passed by, And a whirlwind and fire Drew nigher and nigher, And a small voice anon Bade him up and be gone,— I did not apprehend As I sat to the end And watched for her smile Across the sunned aisle, That this tale of a seer Which came once a year Might, when sands were heaping, Be like a sweat creeping, Or in any degree Bear on her or on me! II When later, by chance Of circumstance, It befel me to read On a hot afternoon At the lectern there The selfsame words As the lesson decreed, To the gathered few From the hamlets near— Folk of flocks and herds Sitting half aswoon, Who listened thereto As women and men Not overmuch Concerned at such— So, like them then, I did not see What drought might be With me, with her, As the Kalendar Moved on, and Time Devoured our prime. III But now, at last, When our glory has passed, And there is no smile From her in the aisle, But where it once shone A marble, men say, With her name thereon Is discerned to-day; And spiritless In the wilderness I shrink from sight And desire the night, (Though, as in old wise, I might still arise, Go forth, and stand And prophesy in the land), I feel the shake Of wind and earthquake, And consuming fire Nigher and nigher, And the voice catch clear, “What doest thou here?” The Spectator: 1916. During the War. ON A MIDSUMMER EVE I idly cut a parsley stalk, And blew therein towards the moon; I had not thought what ghosts would walk With shivering footsteps to my tune. I went, and knelt, and scooped my hand As if to drink, into the brook, And a faint figure seemed to stand Above me, with the bygone look. I lipped rough rhymes of chance, not choice, I thought not what my words might be; There came into my ear a voice That turned a tenderer verse for me. TIMING HER (Written to an old folk-tune) Lalage's coming: Where is she now, O? Turning to bow, O, And smile, is she, Just at parting, Parting, parting, As she is starting To come to me? Where is she now, O, Now, and now, O, Shadowing a bough, O, Of hedge or tree As she is rushing, Rushing, rushing, Gossamers brushing To come to me? Lalage's coming; Where is she now, O; Climbing the brow, O, Of hills I see? Yes, she is nearing, Nearing, nearing, Weather unfearing To come to me. Near is she now, O, Now, and now, O; Milk the rich cow, O, Forward the tea; Shake the down bed for her, Linen sheets spread for her, Drape round the head for her Coming to me. Lalage's coming, She's nearer now, O, End anyhow, O, To-day's husbandry! Would a gilt chair were mine, Slippers of vair were mine, Brushes for hair were mine Of ivory! What will she think, O, She who's so comely, Viewing how homely A sort are we! Nothing resplendent, No prompt attendant, Not one dependent Pertaining to me! Lalage's coming; Where is she now, O? Fain I'd avow, O, Full honestly Nought here's enough for her, All is too rough for her, Even my love for her Poor in degree. She's nearer now, O, Still nearer now, O, She 'tis, I vow, O, Passing the lea. Rush down to meet her there, Call out and greet her there, Never a sweeter there Crossed to me! Lalage's come; aye, Come is she now, O! . . . Does Heaven allow, O, A meeting to be? Yes, she is here now, Here now, here now, Nothing to fear now, Here's Lalage! BEFORE KNOWLEDGE When I walked roseless tracks and wide, Ere dawned your date for meeting me, O why did you not cry Halloo Across the stretch between, and say: “We move, while years as yet divide, On closing lines which—though it be You know me not nor I know you— Will intersect and join some day!” Then well I had borne Each scraping thorn; But the winters froze, And grew no rose; No bridge bestrode The gap at all; No shape you showed, And I heard no call! THE BLINDED BIRD So zestfully canst thou sing? And all this indignity, With God's consent, on thee! Blinded ere yet a-wing By the red-hot needle thou, I stand and wonder how So zestfully thou canst sing! Resenting not such wrong, Thy grievous pain forgot, Eternal dark thy lot, Groping thy whole life long, After that stab of fire; Enjailed in pitiless wire; Resenting not such wrong! Who hath charity? This bird. Who suffereth long and is kind, Is not provoked, though blind And alive ensepulchred? Who hopeth, endureth all things? Who thinketh no evil, but sings? Who is divine? This bird. “THE WIND BLEW WORDS” The wind blew words along the skies, And these it blew to me Through the wide dusk: “Lift up your eyes, Behold this troubled tree, Complaining as it sways and plies; It is a limb of thee. “Yea, too, the creatures sheltering round— Dumb figures, wild and tame, Yea, too, thy fellows who abound— Either of speech the same Or far and strange—black, dwarfed, and browned, They are stuff of thy own frame.” I moved on in a surging awe Of inarticulateness At the pathetic Me I saw In all his huge distress, Making self-slaughter of the law To kill, break, or suppress. THE FADED FACE How was this I did not see Such a look as here was shown Ere its womanhood had blown Past its first felicity?— That I did not know you young, Faded Face, Know you young! Why did Time so ill bestead That I heard no voice of yours Hail from out the curved contours Of those lips when rosy red; Weeted not the songs they sung, Faded Face, Songs they sung! By these blanchings, blooms of old, And the relics of your voice— Leavings rare of rich and choice From your early tone and mould— Let me mourn,—aye, sorrow-wrung. Faded Face, Sorrow-wrung! THE RIDDLE I Stretching eyes west Over the sea, Wind foul or fair, Always stood she Prospect-impressed; Solely out there Did her gaze rest, Never elsewhere Seemed charm to be. II Always eyes east Ponders she now— As in devotion— Hills of blank brow Where no waves plough. Never the least Room for emotion Drawn from the ocean Does she allow. THE DUEL “I am here to time, you see; The glade is well-screened—eh?—against alarm; Fit place to vindicate by my arm The honour of my spotless wife, Who scorns your libel upon her life In boasting intimacy! “‘All hush-offerings you'll spurn, My husband. Two must come; one only go,’ She said. ‘That he'll be you I know; To faith like ours Heaven will be just, And I shall abide in fullest trust Your speedy glad return.’” “Good. Here am also I; And we'll proceed without more waste of words To warm your cockpit. Of the swords Take you your choice. I shall thereby Feel that on me no blame can lie, Whatever Fate accords.” So stripped they there, and fought, And the swords clicked and scraped, and the onsets sped; Till the husband fell; and his shirt was red With streams from his heart's hot cistern. Nought Could save him now; and the other, wrought Maybe to pity, said: “Why did you urge on this? Your wife assured you; and 't had better been That you had let things pass, serene In confidence of long-tried bliss, Holding there could be nought amiss In what my words might mean.” Then, seeing nor ruth nor rage Could move his foeman more—now Death's deaf thrall— He wiped his steel, and, with a call Like turtledove to dove, swift broke Into the copse, where under an oak His horse cropt, held by a page. “All's over, Sweet,” he cried To the wife, thus guised; for the young page was she. “'Tis as we hoped and said 't would be. He never guessed . . . . We mount and ride To where our love can reign uneyed. He's clay, and we are free.” AT MAYFAIR LODGINGS How could I be aware, The opposite window eyeing As I lay listless there, That through its blinds was dying One I had rated rare Before I had set me sighing For another more fair? Had the house-front been glass, My vision unobscuring, Could aught have come to pass More happiness-insuring To her, loved as a lass When spouseless, all-alluring? I reckon not, alas! So, the square window stood, Steadily night-long shining In my close neighbourhood, Who looked forth undivining That soon would go for good One there in pain reclining, Unpardoned, unadieu'd. Silently screened from view Her tragedy was ending That need not have come due Had she been less unbending. How near, near were we two At that last vital rending,— And neither of us knew! TO MY FATHER'S VIOLIN Does he want you down there In the Nether Glooms where The hours may be a dragging load upon him, As he hears the axle grind Round and round Of the great world, in the blind Still profound Of the night-time? He might liven at the sound Of your string, revealing you had not forgone him. In the gallery west the nave, But a few yards from his grave, Did you, tucked beneath his chin, to his bowing Guide the homely harmony Of the quire Who for long years strenuously— Son and sire— Caught the strains that at his fingering low or higher From your four thin threads and eff-holes came outflowing. And, too, what merry tunes He would bow at nights or noons That chanced to find him bent to lute a measure, When he made you speak his heart As in dream, Without book or music-chart, On some theme Elusive as a jack-o'-lanthorn's gleam, And the psalm of duty shelved for trill of pleasure. Well, you can not, alas, The barrier overpass That screens him in those Mournful Meads hereunder, Where no fiddling can be heard In the glades Of silentness, no bird Thrills the shades; Where no viol is touched for songs or serenades, No bowing wakes a congregation's wonder. He must do without you now, Stir you no more anyhow To yearning concords taught you in your glory; While, your strings a tangled wreck, Once smart drawn, Ten worm-wounds in your neck, Purflings wan With dust-hoar, here alone I sadly con Your present dumbness, shape your olden story. 1916. THE STATUE OF LIBERTY This statue of Liberty, busy man, Here erect in the city square, I have watched while your scrubbings, this early morning, Strangely wistful, And half tristful, Have turned her from foul to fair; With your bucket of water, and mop, and brush, Bringing her out of the grime That has smeared her during the smokes of winter With such glumness In her dumbness, And aged her before her time. You have washed her down with motherly care— Head, shoulders, arm, and foot, To the very hem of the robes that drape her— All expertly And alertly, Till a long stream, black with soot, Flows over the pavement to the road, And her shape looms pure as snow: I read you are hired by the City guardians— May be yearly, Or once merely— To treat the statues so? “Oh, I'm not hired by the Councilmen To cleanse the statues here. I do this one as a self-willed duty, Not as paid to, Or at all made to, But because the doing is dear.” Ah, then I hail you brother and friend! Liberty's knight divine. What you have done would have been my doing, Yea, most verily, Well, and thoroughly, Had but your courage been mine! “Oh I care not for Liberty's mould, Liberty charms not me; What's Freedom but an idler's vision, Vain, pernicious, Often vicious, Of things that cannot be! “Memory it is that brings me to this— Of a daughter—my one sweet own. She grew a famous carver's model, One of the fairest And of the rarest:— She sat for the figure as shown. “But alas, she died in this distant place Before I was warned to betake Myself to her side! . . . And in love of my darling, In love of the fame of her, And the good name of her, I do this for her sake.” Answer I gave not. Of that form The carver was I at his side; His child, my model, held so saintly, Grand in feature, Gross in nature, In the dens of vice had died. THE BACKGROUND AND THE FIGURE (Lover's Ditty) I think of the slope where the rabbits fed, Of the periwinks' rockwork lair, Of the fuchsias ringing their bells of red— And the something else seen there. Between the blooms where the sod basked bright, By the bobbing fuchsia trees, Was another and yet more eyesome sight— The sight that richened these. I shall seek those beauties in the spring, When the days are fit and fair, But only as foils to the one more thing That also will flower there! THE CHANGE Out of the past there rises a week— Who shall read the years O!— Out of the past there rises a week Enringed with a purple zone. Out of the past there rises a week When thoughts were strung too thick to speak, And the magic of its lineaments remains with me alone. In that week there was heard a singing— Who shall spell the years, the years!— In that week there was heard a singing, And the white owl wondered why. In that week, yea, a voice was ringing, And forth from the casement were candles flinging Radiance that fell on the deodar and lit up the path thereby. Could that song have a mocking note?— Who shall unroll the years O!— Could that song have a mocking note To the white owl's sense as it fell? Could that song have a mocking note As it trilled out warm from the singer's throat, And who was the mocker and who the mocked when two felt all was well? In a tedious trampling crowd yet later— Who shall bare the years, the years!— In a tedious trampling crowd yet later, When silvery singings were dumb; In a crowd uncaring what time might fate her, Mid murks of night I stood to await her, And the twanging of iron wheels gave out the signal that she was come. She said with a travel-tired smile— Who shall lift the years O!— She said with a travel-tired smile, Half scared by scene so strange; She said, outworn by mile on mile, The blurred lamps wanning her face the while, “O Love, I am here; I am with you!” . . . Ah, that there should have come a change! O the doom by someone spoken— Who shall unseal the years, the years!— O the doom that gave no token, When nothing of bale saw we: O the doom by someone spoken, O the heart by someone broken, The heart whose sweet reverberances are all time leaves to me. Jan.–Feb. 1913. SITTING ON THE BRIDGE (Echo of an old song) Sitting on the bridge Past the barracks, town and ridge, At once the spirit seized us To sing a song that pleased us— As “The Fifth” were much in rumour; It was “Whilst I'm in the humour, Take me, Paddy, will you now?” And a lancer soon drew nigh, And his Royal Irish eye Said, “Willing, faith, am I, O, to take you anyhow, dears, To take you anyhow.” But, lo!—dad walking by, Cried, “What, you lightheels! Fie! Is this the way you roam And mock the sunset gleam?” And he marched us straightway home, Though we said, “We are only, daddy, Singing, ‘Will you take me, Paddy?’” —Well, we never saw from then, If we sang there anywhen, The soldier dear again, Except at night in dream-time, Except at night in dream. Perhaps that soldier's fighting In a land that's far away, Or he may be idly plighting Some foreign hussy gay; Or perhaps his bones are whiting In the wind to their decay! . . . Ah!—does he mind him how The girls he saw that day On the bridge, were sitting singing At the time of curfew-ringing, “Take me, Paddy; will you now, dear? Paddy, will you now?” Grey's Bridge. THE YOUNG CHURCHWARDEN When he lit the candles there, And the light fell on his hand, And it trembled as he scanned Her and me, his vanquished air Hinted that his dream was done, And I saw he had begun To understand. When Love's viol was unstrung, Sore I wished the hand that shook Had been mine that shared her book While that evening hymn was sung, His the victor's, as he lit Candles where he had bidden us sit With vanquished look. Now her dust lies listless there, His afar from tending hand, What avails the victory scanned? Does he smile from upper air: “Ah, my friend, your dream is done; And 'tis you who have begun To understand!” “I TRAVEL AS A PHANTOM NOW” I travel as a phantom now, For people do not wish to see In flesh and blood so bare a bough As Nature makes of me. And thus I visit bodiless Strange gloomy households often at odds, And wonder if Man's consciousness Was a mistake of God's. And next I meet you, and I pause, And think that if mistake it were, As some have said, O then it was One that I well can bear! 1915. LINES TO A MOVEMENT IN MOZART'S E-FLAT SYMPHONY Show me again the time When in the Junetide's prime We flew by meads and mountains northerly!— Yea, to such freshness, fairness, fulness, fineness, freeness, Love lures life on. Show me again the day When from the sandy bay We looked together upon the pestered sea!— Yea, to such surging, swaying, sighing, swelling, shrinking, Love lures life on. Show me again the hour When by the pinnacled tower We eyed each other and feared futurity!— Yea, to such bodings, broodings, beatings, blanchings, blessings, Love lures life on. Show me again just this: The moment of that kiss Away from the prancing folk, by the strawberry-tree!— Yea, to such rashness, ratheness, rareness, ripeness, richness, Love lures life on. Begun November 1898. “IN THE SEVENTIES” “Qui deridetur ab amico suo sicut ego.” —Job. In the seventies I was bearing in my breast, Penned tight, Certain starry thoughts that threw a magic light On the worktimes and the soundless hours of rest In the seventies; aye, I bore them in my breast Penned tight. In the seventies when my neighbours—even my friend— Saw me pass, Heads were shaken, and I heard the words, “Alas, For his onward years and name unless he mend!” In the seventies, when my neighbours and my friend Saw me pass. In the seventies those who met me did not know Of the vision That immuned me from the chillings of misprision And the damps that choked my goings to and fro In the seventies; yea, those nodders did not know Of the vision. In the seventies nought could darken or destroy it, Locked in me, Though as delicate as lamp-worm's lucency; Neither mist nor murk could weaken or alloy it In the seventies!—could not darken or destroy it, Locked in me. THE PEDIGREE I I bent in the deep of night Over a pedigree the chronicler gave As mine; and as I bent there, half-unrobed, The uncurtained panes of my window-square let in the watery light Of the moon in its old age: And green-rheumed clouds were hurrying past where mute and cold it globed Like a drifting dolphin's eye seen through a lapping wave. II So, scanning my sire-sown tree, And the hieroglyphs of this spouse tied to that, With offspring mapped below in lineage, Till the tangles troubled me, The branches seemed to twist into a seared and cynic face Which winked and tokened towards the window like a Mage Enchanting me to gaze again thereat. III It was a mirror now, And in it a long perspective I could trace Of my begetters, dwindling backward each past each All with the kindred look, Whose names had since been inked down in their place On the recorder's book, Generation and generation of my mien, and build, and brow. IV And then did I divine That every heave and coil and move I made Within my brain, and in my mood and speech, Was in the glass portrayed As long forestalled by their so making it; The first of them, the primest fuglemen of my line, Being fogged in far antiqueness past surmise and reason's reach. V Said I then, sunk in tone, “I am merest mimicker and counterfeit!— Though thinking, I am I, And what I do I do myself alone.” —The cynic twist of the page thereat unknit Back to its normal figure, having wrought its purport wry, The Mage's mirror left the window-square, And the stained moon and drift retook their places there. 1916. HIS HEART A WOMAN'S DREAM At midnight, in the room where he lay dead Whom in his life I had never clearly read, I thought if I could peer into that citadel His heart, I should at last know full and well What hereto had been known to him alone, Despite our long sit-out of years foreflown, “And if,” I said, “I do this for his memory's sake, It would not wound him, even if he could wake.” So I bent over him. He seemed to smile With a calm confidence the whole long while That I, withdrawing his heart, held it and, bit by bit, Perused the unguessed things found written on it. It was inscribed like a terrestrial sphere With quaint vermiculations close and clear— His graving. Had I known, would I have risked the stroke Its reading brought, and my own heart nigh broke! Yes, there at last, eyes opened, did I see His whole sincere symmetric history; There were his truth, his simple singlemindedness, Strained, maybe, by time's storms, but there no less. There were the daily deeds from sun to sun In blindness, but good faith, that he had done; There were regrets, at instances wherein he swerved (As he conceived) from cherishings I had deserved. There were old hours all figured down as bliss— Those spent with me—(how little had I thought this!) There those when, at my absence, whether he slept or waked, (Though I knew not 'twas so!) his spirit ached. There that when we were severed, how day dulled Till time joined us anew, was chronicled: And arguments and battlings in defence of me That heart recorded clearly and ruddily. I put it back, and left him as he lay While pierced the morning pink and then the gray Into each dreary room and corridor around, Where I shall wait, but his step will not sound. WHERE THEY LIVED Dishevelled leaves creep down Upon that bank to-day, Some green, some yellow, and some pale brown; The wet bents bob and sway; The once warm slippery turf is sodden Where we laughingly sat or lay. The summerhouse is gone, Leaving a weedy space; The bushes that veiled it once have grown Gaunt trees that interlace, Through whose lank limbs I see too clearly The nakedness of the place. And where were hills of blue, Blind drifts of vapour blow, And the names of former dwellers few, If any, people know, And instead of a voice that called, “Come in, Dears,” Time calls, “Pass below!” THE OCCULTATION When the cloud shut down on the morning shine, And darkened the sun, I said, “So ended that joy of mine Years back begun.” But day continued its lustrous roll In upper air; And did my late irradiate soul Live on somewhere? LIFE LAUGHS ONWARD Rambling I looked for an old abode Where, years back, one had lived I knew; Its site a dwelling duly showed, But it was new. I went where, not so long ago, The sod had riven two breasts asunder; Daisies throve gaily there, as though No grave were under. I walked along a terrace where Loud children gambolled in the sun: The figure that had once sat there Was missed by none. Life laughed and moved on unsubdued, I saw that Old succumbed to Young: 'Twas well. My too regretful mood Died on my tongue. THE PEACE-OFFERING It was but a little thing, Yet I knew it meant to me Ease from what had given a sting To the very birdsinging Latterly. But I would not welcome it; And for all I then declined O the regrettings infinite When the night-processions flit Through the mind! “SOMETHING TAPPED” Something tapped on the pane of my room When there was never a trace Of wind or rain, and I saw in the gloom My weary Belovéd's face. “O I am tired of waiting,” she said, “Night, morn, noon, afternoon; So cold it is in my lonely bed, And I thought you would join me soon!” I rose and neared the window-glass, But vanished thence had she: Only a pallid moth, alas, Tapped at the pane for me. August 1913. THE WOUND I climbed to the crest, And, fog-festooned, The sun lay west Like a crimson wound: Like that wound of mine Of which none knew, For I'd given no sign That it pierced me through. A MERRYMAKING IN QUESTION “I will get a new string for my fiddle, And call to the neighbours to come, And partners shall dance down the middle Until the old pewter-wares hum: And we'll sip the mead, cyder, and rum!” From the night came the oddest of answers: A hollow wind, like a bassoon, And headstones all ranged up as dancers, And cypresses droning a croon, And gurgoyles that mouthed to the tune. “I SAID AND SANG HER EXCELLENCE” (Fickle Lover's Song) I said and sang her excellence: They called it laud undue. (Have your way, my heart, O!) Yet what was homage far above The plain deserts of my olden Love Proved verity of my new. “She moves a sylph in picture-land, Where nothing frosts the air:” (Have your way, my heart, O!) “To all winged pipers overhead She is known by shape and song,” I said, Conscious of licence there. I sang of her in a dim old hall Dream-built too fancifully, (Have your way, my heart, O!) But lo, the ripe months chanced to lead My feet to such a hall indeed, Where stood the very She. Strange, startling, was it then to learn I had glanced down unborn time, (Have your way, my heart, O!) And prophesied, whereby I knew That which the years had planned to do In warranty of my rhyme. By Rushy-Pond. A JANUARY NIGHT (1879) The rain smites more and more, The east wind snarls and sneezes; Through the joints of the quivering door The water wheezes. The tip of each ivy-shoot Writhes on its neighbour's face; There is some hid dread afoot That we cannot trace. Is it the spirit astray Of the man at the house below Whose coffin they took in to-day? We do not know. A KISS By a wall the stranger now calls his, Was born of old a particular kiss, Without forethought in its genesis; Which in a trice took wing on the air. And where that spot is nothing shows: There ivy calmly grows, And no one knows What a birth was there! That kiss is gone where none can tell— Not even those who felt its spell: It cannot have died; that know we well. Somewhere it pursues its flight, One of a long procession of sounds Travelling aethereal rounds Far from earth's bounds In the infinite. THE ANNOUNCEMENT They came, the brothers, and took two chairs In their usual quiet way; And for a time we did not think They had much to say. And they began and talked awhile Of ordinary things, Till spread that silence in the room A pent thought brings. And then they said: “The end has come. Yes: it has come at last.” And we looked down, and knew that day A spirit had passed. THE OXEN Christmas Eve, and twelve of the clock. “Now they are all on their knees,” An elder said as we sat in a flock By the embers in hearthside ease. We pictured the meek mild creatures where They dwelt in their strawy pen, Nor did it occur to one of us there To doubt they were kneeling then. So fair a fancy few would weave In these years! Yet, I feel, If someone said on Christmas Eve, “Come; see the oxen kneel “In the lonely barton by yonder coomb Our childhood used to know,” I should go with him in the gloom, Hoping it might be so. 1915. THE TRESSES “When the air was damp It made my curls hang slack As they kissed my neck and back While I footed the salt-aired track I loved to tramp. “When it was dry They would roll up crisp and tight As I went on in the light Of the sun, which my own sprite Seemed to outvie. “Now I am old; And have not one gay curl As I had when a girl For dampness to unfurl Or sun uphold!” THE PHOTOGRAPH The flame crept up the portrait line by line As it lay on the coals in the silence of night's profound, And over the arm's incline, And along the marge of the silkwork superfine, And gnawed at the delicate bosom's defenceless round. Then I vented a cry of hurt, and averted my eyes; The spectacle was one that I could not bear, To my deep and sad surprise; But, compelled to heed, I again looked furtivewise Till the flame had eaten her breasts, and mouth, and hair. “Thank God, she is out of it now!” I said at last, In a great relief of heart when the thing was done That had set my soul aghast, And nothing was left of the picture unsheathed from the past But the ashen ghost of the card it had figured on. She was a woman long hid amid packs of years, She might have been living or dead; she was lost to my sight, And the deed that had nigh drawn tears Was done in a casual clearance of life's arrears; But I felt as if I had put her to death that night! . . . —Well; she knew nothing thereof did she survive, And suffered nothing if numbered among the dead; Yet—yet—if on earth alive Did she feel a smart, and with vague strange anguish strive? If in heaven, did she smile at me sadly and shake her head? ON A HEATH I could hear a gown-skirt rustling Before I could see her shape, Rustling through the heather That wove the common's drape, On that evening of dark weather When I hearkened, lips agape. And the town-shine in the distance Did but baffle here the sight, And then a voice flew forward: “Dear, is't you? I fear the night!” And the herons flapped to norward In the firs upon my right. There was another looming Whose life we did not see; There was one stilly blooming Full nigh to where walked we; There was a shade entombing All that was bright of me. AN ANNIVERSARY It was at the very date to which we have come, In the month of the matching name, When, at a like minute, the sun had upswum, Its couch-time at night being the same. And the same path stretched here that people now follow, And the same stile crossed their way, And beyond the same green hillock and hollow The same horizon lay; And the same man pilgrims now hereby who pilgrimed here that day. Let so much be said of the date-day's sameness; But the tree that neighbours the track, And stoops like a pedlar afflicted with lameness, Knew of no sogged wound or wind-crack. And the joints of that wall were not enshrouded With mosses of many tones, And the garth up afar was not overcrowded With a multitude of white stones, And the man's eyes then were not so sunk that you saw the socket-bones. Kingston-Maurward Ewelease. “BY THE RUNIC STONE” (Two who became a story) By the Runic Stone They sat, where the grass sloped down, And chattered, he white-hatted, she in brown, Pink-faced, breeze-blown. Rapt there alone In the transport of talking so In such a place, there was nothing to let them know What hours had flown. And the die thrown By them heedlessly there, the dent It was to cut in their encompassment, Were, too, unknown. It might have strown Their zest with qualms to see, As in a glass, Time toss their history From zone to zone! THE PINK FROCK “O my pretty pink frock, I sha'n't be able to wear it! Why is he dying just now? I hardly can bear it! “He might have contrived to live on; But they say there's no hope whatever: And must I shut myself up, And go out never? “O my pretty pink frock? Puff-sleeved and accordion-pleated! He might have passed in July, And not so cheated!” TRANSFORMATIONS Portion of this yew Is a man my grandsire knew, Bosomed here at its foot: This branch may be his wife, A ruddy human life Now turned to a green shoot. These grasses must be made Of her who often prayed, Last century, for repose; And the fair girl long ago Whom I often tried to know May be entering this rose. So, they are not underground, But as nerves and veins abound In the growths of upper air, And they feel the sun and rain, And the energy again That made them what they were! IN HER PRECINCTS Her house looked cold from the foggy lea, And the square of each window a dull black blur Where showed no stir: Yes, her gloom within at the lack of me Seemed matching mine at the lack of her. The black squares grew to be squares of light As the eveshade swathed the house and lawn, And viols gave tone; There was glee within. And I found that night The gloom of severance mine alone. Kingston-Maurward Park. THE LAST SIGNAL (Oct. 11, 1886) A MEMORY OF WILLIAM BARNES Silently I footed by an uphill road That led from my abode to a spot yew-boughed; Yellowly the sun sloped low down to westward, And dark was the east with cloud. Then, amid the shadow of that livid sad east, Where the light was least, and a gate stood wide, Something flashed the fire of the sun that was facing it, Like a brief blaze on that side. Looking hard and harder I knew what it meant— The sudden shine sent from the livid east scene; It meant the west mirrored by the coffin of my friend there, Turning to the road from his green, To take his last journey forth—he who in his prime Trudged so many a time from that gate athwart the land! Thus a farewell to me he signalled on his grave-way, As with a wave of his hand. Winterborne-Came Path. THE HOUSE OF SILENCE “That is a quiet place— That house in the trees with the shady lawn.” “—If, child, you knew what there goes on You would not call it a quiet place. Why, a phantom abides there, the last of its race, And a brain spins there till dawn.” “But I see nobody there,— Nobody moves about the green, Or wanders the heavy trees between.” “—Ah, that's because you do not bear The visioning powers of souls who dare To pierce the material screen. “Morning, noon, and night, Mid those funereal shades that seem The uncanny scenery of a dream, Figures dance to a mind with sight, And music and laughter like floods of light Make all the precincts gleam. “It is a poet's bower, Through which there pass, in fleet arrays, Long teams of all the years and days, Of joys and sorrows, of earth and heaven, That meet mankind in its ages seven, An aion in an hour.” GREAT THINGS Sweet cyder is a great thing, A great thing to me, Spinning down to Weymouth town By Ridgway thirstily, And maid and mistress summoning Who tend the hostelry: O cyder is a great thing, A great thing to me! The dance it is a great thing, A great thing to me, With candles lit and partners fit For night-long revelry; And going home when day-dawning Peeps pale upon the lea: O dancing is a great thing, A great thing to me! Love is, yea, a great thing, A great thing to me, When, having drawn across the lawn In darkness silently, A figure flits like one a-wing Out from the nearest tree: O love is, yes, a great thing, A great thing to me! Will these be always great things, Great things to me? . . . Let it befall that One will call, “Soul, I have need of thee:” What then? Joy-jaunts, impassioned flings, Love, and its ecstasy, Will always have been great things, Great things to me! THE CHIMES That morning when I trod the town The twitching chimes of long renown Played out to me The sweet Sicilian sailors' tune, And I knew not if late or soon My day would be: A day of sunshine beryl-bright And windless; yea, think as I might, I could not say, Even to within years' measure, when One would be at my side who then Was far away. When hard utilitarian times Had stilled the sweet Saint-Peter's chimes I learnt to see That bale may spring where blisses are, And one desired might be afar Though near to me. THE FIGURE IN THE SCENE It pleased her to step in front and sit Where the cragged slope was green, While I stood back that I might pencil it With her amid the scene; Till it gloomed and rained; But I kept on, despite the drifting wet That fell and stained My draught, leaving for curious quizzings yet The blots engrained. And thus I drew her there alone, Seated amid the gauze Of moisture, hooded, only her outline shown, With rainfall marked across. —Soon passed our stay; Yet her rainy form is the Genius still of the spot, Immutable, yea, Though the place now knows her no more, and has known her not Ever since that day. From an old note. “WHY DID I SKETCH” Why did I sketch an upland green, And put the figure in Of one on the spot with me?— For now that one has ceased to be seen The picture waxes akin To a wordless irony. If you go drawing on down or cliff Let no soft curves intrude Of a woman's silhouette, But show the escarpments stark and stiff As in utter solitude; So shall you half forget. Let me sooner pass from sight of the sky Than again on a thoughtless day Limn, laugh, and sing, and rhyme With a woman sitting near, whom I Paint in for love, and who may Be called hence in my time From an old note. CONJECTURE If there were in my kalendar No Emma, Florence, Mary, What would be my existence now— A hermit's?—wanderer's weary?— How should I live, and how Near would be death, or far? Could it have been that other eyes Might have uplit my highway? That fond, sad, retrospective sight Would catch from this dim byway Prized figures different quite From those that now arise? With how strange aspect would there creep The dawn, the night, the daytime, If memory were not what it is In song-time, toil, or pray-time.— O were it else than this, I'd pass to pulseless sleep! THE BLOW That no man schemed it is my hope— Yea, that it fell by will and scope Of That Which some enthrone, And for whose meaning myriads grope. For I would not that of my kind There should, of his unbiassed mind, Have been one known Who such a stroke could have designed; Since it would augur works and ways Below the lowest that man assays To have hurled that stone Into the sunshine of our days! And if it prove that no man did, And that the Inscrutable, the Hid, Was cause alone Of this foul crash our lives amid, I'll go in due time, and forget In some deep graveyard's oubliette The thing whereof I groan, And cease from troubling; thankful yet Time's finger should have stretched to show No aimful author's was the blow That swept us prone, But the Immanent Doer's That doth not know, Which in some age unguessed of us May lift Its blinding incubus, And see, and own: “It grieves me I did thus and thus!” LOVE THE MONOPOLIST (Young Lover's Reverie) The train draws forth from the station-yard, And with it carries me. I rise, and stretch out, and regard The platform left, and see An airy slim blue form there standing, And know that it is she. While with strained vision I watch on, The figure turns round quite To greet friends gaily; then is gone . . . . The import may be slight, But why remained she not hard gazing Till I was out of sight? “O do not chat with others there,” I brood. “They are not I. O strain your thoughts as if they were Gold bands between us; eye All neighbour scenes as so much blankness Till I again am by! “A troubled soughing in the breeze And the sky overhead Let yourself feel; and shadeful trees, Ripe corn, and apples red, Read as things barren and distasteful While we are separated! “When I come back uncloak your gloom. And let in lovely day; Then the long dark as of the tomb Can well be thrust away With sweet things I shall have to practise, And you will have to say!” Begun 1871: finished? AT MIDDLE-FIELD GATE IN FEBRUARY The bars are thick with drops that show As they gather themselves from the fog Like silver buttons ranged in a row, And as evenly spaced as if measured, although They fall at the feeblest jog. They load the leafless hedge hard by, And the blades of last year's grass While the fallow ploughland turned up nigh In raw rolls, clammy and clogging lie— Too clogging for feet to pass. How dry it was on a far-back day When straws hung the hedge and around, When amid the sheaves in amorous play In curtained bonnets and light array Bloomed a bevy now underground! Bockhampton Lane. THE YOUTH WHO CARRIED A LIGHT I saw him pass as the new day dawned, Murmuring some musical phrase; Horses were drinking and floundering in the pond, And the tired stars thinned their gaze; Yet these were not the spectacles at all that he conned, But an inner one, giving out rays. Such was the thing in his eye, walking there, The very and visible thing, A close light, displacing the gray of the morning air, And the tokens that the dark was taking wing; And was it not the radiance of a purpose rare That might ripe to its accomplishing? What became of that light? I wonder still its fate! Was it quenched ere its full apogee? Did it struggle frail and frailer to a beam emaciate? Did it thrive till matured in verity? Or did it travel on, to be a new young dreamer's freight, And thence on infinitely? 1915. THE HEAD ABOVE THE FOG Something do I see Above the fog that sheets the mead, A figure like to life indeed, Moving along with spectre-speed, Seen by none but me. O the vision keen!— Tripping along to me for love As in the flesh it used to move, Only its hat and plume above The evening fog-fleece seen. In the day-fall wan, When nighted birds break off their song, Mere ghostly head it skims along, Just as it did when warm and strong, Body seeming gone. Such it is I see Above the fog that sheets the mead— Yea, that which once could breathe and plead!— Skimming along with spectre-speed To a last tryst with me. OVERLOOKING THE RIVER STOUR The swallows flew in the curves of an eight Above the river-gleam In the wet June's last beam: Like little crossbows animate The swallows flew in the curves of an eight Above the river-gleam. Planing up shavings of crystal spray A moor-hen darted out From the bank thereabout, And through the stream-shine ripped his way; Planing up shavings of crystal spray A moor-hen darted out. Closed were the kingcups; and the mead Dripped in monotonous green, Though the day's morning sheen Had shown it golden and honeybee'd; Closed were the kingcups; and the mead Dripped in monotonous green. And never I turned my head, alack, While these things met my gaze Through the pane's drop-drenched glaze, To see the more behind my back . . . . O never I turned, but let, alack, These less things hold my gaze! THE MUSICAL BOX Lifelong to be Seemed the fair colour of the time; That there was standing shadowed near A spirit who sang to the gentle chime Of the self-struck notes, I did not hear, I did not see. Thus did it sing To the mindless lyre that played indoors As she came to listen for me without: “O value what the nonce outpours— This best of life—that shines about Your welcoming!” I had slowed along After the torrid hours were done, Though still the posts and walls and road Flung back their sense of the hot-faced sun, And had walked by Stourside Mill, where broad Stream-lilies throng. And I descried The dusky house that stood apart, And her, white-muslined, waiting there In the porch with high-expectant heart, While still the thin mechanic air Went on inside. At whiles would flit Swart bats, whose wings, be-webbed and tanned, Whirred like the wheels of ancient clocks: She laughed a hailing as she scanned Me in the gloom, the tuneful box Intoning it. Lifelong to be I thought it. That there watched hard by A spirit who sang to the indoor tune, “O make the most of what is nigh!” I did not hear in my dull soul-swoon— I did not see. ON STURMINSTER FOOT-BRIDGE (Onomatopœic) Reticulations creep upon the slack stream's face When the wind skims irritably past, The current clucks smartly into each hollow place That years of flood have scrabbled in the pier's sodden base; The floating-lily leaves rot fast. On a roof stand the swallows ranged in wistful waiting rows, Till they arrow off and drop like stones Among the eyot-withies at whose foot the river flows: And beneath the roof is she who in the dark world shows As a lattice-gleam when midnight moans. ROYAL SPONSORS “The king and the queen will stand to the child; 'Twill be handed down in song; And it's no more than their deserving, With my lord so faithful at Court so long, And so staunch and strong. “O never before was known such a thing! 'Twill be a grand time for all; And the beef will be a whole-roast bullock, And the servants will have a feast in the hall, And the ladies a ball. “While from Jordan's stream by a traveller, In a flagon of silver wrought, And by caravan, stage-coach, wain, and waggon A precious trickle has been brought, Clear as when caught.” The morning came. To the park of the peer The royal couple bore; And the font was filled with the Jordan water, And the household awaited their guests before The carpeted door. But when they went to the silk-lined cot The child was found to have died. “What's now to be done? We can disappoint not The king and queen!” the family cried With eyes spread wide. “Even now they approach the chestnut-drive! The service must be read.” “Well, since we can't christen the child alive, By God we shall have to christen him dead!” The marquis said. Thus, breath-forsaken, a corpse was taken To the private chapel—yea— And the king knew not, nor the queen, God wot, That they answered for one returned to clay At the font that day. OLD FURNITURE I know not how it may be with others Who sit amid relics of householdry That date from the days of their mothers' mothers, But well I know how it is with me Continually. I see the hands of the generations That owned each shiny familiar thing In play on its knobs and indentations, And with its ancient fashioning Still dallying: Hands behind hands, growing paler and paler, As in a mirror a candle-flame Shows images of itself, each frailer As it recedes, though the eye may frame Its shape the same. On the clock's dull dial a foggy finger, Moving to set the minutes right With tentative touches that lift and linger In the wont of a moth on a summer night, Creeps to my sight. On this old viol, too, fingers are dancing— As whilom—just over the strings by the nut, The tip of a bow receding, advancing In airy quivers, as if it would cut The plaintive gut. And I see a face by that box for tinder, Glowing forth in fits from the dark, And fading again, as the linten cinder Kindles to red at the flinty spark, Or goes out stark. Well, well. It is best to be up and doing, The world has no use for one to-day Who eyes things thus—no aim pursuing! He should not continue in this stay, But sink away. A THOUGHT IN TWO MOODS I saw it—pink and white—revealed Upon the white and green; The white and green was a daisied field, The pink and white Ethleen. And as I looked it seemed in kind That difference they had none; The two fair bodiments combined As varied miens of one. A sense that, in some mouldering year, As one they both would lie, Made me move quickly on to her To pass the pale thought by. She laughed and said: “Out there, to me, You looked so weather-browned, And brown in clothes, you seemed to be Made of the dusty ground!” THE LAST PERFORMANCE “I am playing my oldest tunes,” declared she, “All the old tunes I know,— Those I learnt ever so long ago.” —Why she should think just then she'd play them Silence cloaks like snow. When I returned from the town at nightfall Notes continued to pour As when I had left two hours before: “It's the very last time,” she said in closing; “From now I play no more.” A few morns onward found her fading, And, as her life outflew, I thought of her playing her tunes right through; And I felt she had known of what was coming, And wondered how she knew. 1912. “YOU ON THE TOWER” I “You on the tower of my factory— What do you see up there? Do you see Enjoyment with wide wings Advancing to reach me here?” —“Yea; I see Enjoyment with wide wings Advancing to reach you here.” II “Good. Soon I'll come and ask you To tell me again thereon . . . . Well, what is he doing now? Hoi, there!” —“He still is flying on.” “Ah, waiting till I have full-finished. Good. Tell me again anon . . . . III Hoi, Watchman! I'm here. When comes he? Between my sweats I am chill.” —“Oh, you there, working still? Why, surely he reached you a time back, And took you miles from your mill? He duly came in his winging, And now he has passed out of view How can it be that you missed him? He brushed you by as he flew.” THE INTERLOPER “And I saw the figure and visage of Madness seeking for a home.” There are three folk driving in a quaint old chaise, And the cliff-side track looks green and fair; I view them talking in quiet glee As they drop down towards the puffins' lair By the roughest of ways; But another with the three rides on, I see, Whom I like not to be there! No: it's not anybody you think of. Next A dwelling appears by a slow sweet stream Where two sit happy and half in the dark: They read, helped out by a frail-wick'd gleam, Some rhythmic text; But one sits with them whom they don't mark, One I'm wishing could not be there. No: not whom you knew and name. And now I discern gay diners in a mansion-place, And the guests dropping wit—pert, prim, or choice, And the hostess's tender and laughing face, And the host's bland brow; But I cannot help hearing a hollow voice. And I'd fain not hear it there. No: it's not from the stranger you met once. Ah, Yet a goodlier scene than that succeeds; People on a lawn—quite a crowd of them. Yes, And they chatter and ramble as fancy leads; And they say, “Hurrah!” To a blithe speech made; save one, mirthless, Who ought not to be there. Nay: it's not the pale Form your imagings raise, That waits on us all at a destined time, It is not the Fourth Figure the Furnace showed; O that it were such a shape sublime In these latter days! It is that under which best lives corrode; Would, would it could not be there! LOGS ON THE HEARTH A MEMORY OF A SISTER. The fire advances along the log Of the tree we felled, Which bloomed and bore striped apples by the peck Till its last hour of bearing knelled. The fork that first my hand would reach And then my foot In climbings upward inch by inch, lies now Sawn, sapless, darkening with soot. Where the bark chars is where, one year, It was pruned, and bled— Then overgrew the wound. But now, at last. Its growings all have stagnated. My fellow-climber rises dim From her chilly grave— Just as she was, her foot near mine on the bending limb, Laughing, her young brown hand awave. December 1915. THE SUNSHADE Ah—it's the skeleton of a lady's sunshade, Here at my feet in the hard rock's chink, Merely a naked sheaf of wires!— Twenty years have gone with their livers and diers Since it was silked in its white or pink. Noonshine riddles the ribs of the sunshade, No more a screen from the weakest ray; Nothing to tell us the hue of its dyes, Nothing but rusty bones as it lies In its coffin of stone, unseen till to-day. Where is the woman who carried that sunshade Up and down this seaside place?— Little thumb standing against its stem, Thoughts perhaps bent on a love-stratagem. Softening yet more the already soft face! Is the fair woman who carried that sunshade A skeleton just as her property is, Laid in the chink that none may scan? And does she regret—if regret dust can— The vain things thought when she flourished this? Swanage Cliffs. THE AGEING HOUSE When the walls were red That now are seen To be overspread With a mouldy green, A fresh fair head Would often lean From the sunny casement And scan the scene, While blithely spoke the wind to the little sycamore tree. But storms have raged Those walls about, And the head has aged That once looked out; And zest is suaged And trust grows doubt, And slow effacement Is rife throughout, While fiercely girds the wind at the long-limbed sycamore tree! THE CAGED GOLDFINCH Within a churchyard, on a recent grave, I saw a little cage That jailed a goldfinch. All was silence save Its hops from stage to stage. There was inquiry in its wistful eye, And once it tried to sing; Of him or her who placed it there, and why, No one knew anything. AT MADAME TUSSAUD'S IN VICTORIAN YEARS “That same first fiddler who leads the orchéstra to-night Here fiddled four decades of years ago; He bears the same babe-like smile of self-centred delight, Same trinket on watch-chain, same ring on the hand with the bow. “But his face, if regarded, is woefully wanner, and drier, And his once dark beard has grown straggling and gray; Yet a blissful existence he seems to have led with his lyre, In a trance of his own, where no wearing or tearing had sway. “Mid these wax figures, who nothing can do, it may seem That to do but a little thing counts a great deal; To be watched by kings, councillors, queens, may be flattering to him— With their glass eyes longing they too could wake notes that appeal.” Ah, but he played staunchly—that fiddler—whoever he was, With the innocent heart and the soul-touching string: May he find the Fair Haven! For did he not smile with good cause? Yes; gamuts that graced forty years'-flight were not a small thing! THE BALLET They crush together—a rustling heap of flesh— Of more than flesh, a heap of souls; and then They part, enmesh, And crush together again, Like the pink petals of a too sanguine rose Frightened shut just when it blows. Though all alike in their tinsel livery, And indistinguishable at a sweeping glance, They muster, maybe, As lives wide in irrelevance; A world of her own has each one underneath, Detached as a sword from its sheath. Daughters, wives, mistresses; honest or false, sold, bought; Hearts of all sizes; gay, fond, gushing, or penned, Various in thought Of lover, rival, friend; Links in a one-pulsed chain, all showing one smile, Yet severed so many a mile! THE FIVE STUDENTS The sparrow dips in his wheel-rut bath, The sun grows passionate-eyed, And boils the dew to smoke by the paddock-path; As strenuously we stride,— Five of us; dark He, fair He, dark She, fair She, I, All beating by. The air is shaken, the high-road hot, Shadowless swoons the day, The greens are sobered and cattle at rest; but not We on our urgent way,— Four of us; fair She, dark She, fair He, I, are there, But one—elsewhere. Autumn moulds the hard fruit mellow, And forward still we press Through moors, briar-meshed plantations, clay-pits yellow, As in the spring hours—yes, Three of us; fair He, fair She, I, as heretofore, But—fallen one more. The leaf drops: earthworms draw it in At night-time noiselessly, The fingers of birch and beech are skeleton-thin, And yet on the beat are we,— Two of us; fair She, I. But no more left to go The track we know. Icicles tag the church-aisle leads, The flag-rope gibbers hoarse, The home-bound foot-folk wrap their snow-flaked heads, Yet I still stalk the course— One of us . . . . Dark and fair He, dark and fair She, gone: The rest—anon. THE WIND'S PROPHECY I travel on by barren farms, And gulls glint out like silver flecks Against a cloud that speaks of wrecks, And bellies down with black alarms. I say: “Thus from my lady's arms I go; those arms I love the best!” The wind replies from dip and rise, “Nay; toward her arms thou journeyest.” A distant verge morosely gray Appears, while clots of flying foam Break from its muddy monochrome, And a light blinks up far away. I sigh: “My eyes now as all day Behold her ebon loops of hair!” Like bursting bonds the wind responds, “Nay, wait for tresses flashing fair!” From tides the lofty coastlands screen Come smitings like the slam of doors, Or hammerings on hollow floors, As the swell cleaves through caves unseen. Say I: “Though broad this wild terrene, Her city home is matched of none!” From the hoarse skies the wind replies: “Thou shouldst have said her sea-bord one. The all-prevailing clouds exclude The one quick timorous transient star; The waves outside where breakers are Huzza like a mad multitude. “Where the sun ups it, mist-imbued,” I cry, “there reigns the star for me!” The wind outshrieks from points and peaks: “Here, westward, where it downs, mean ye!” Yonder the headland, vulturine, Snores like old Skrymer in his sleep, And every chasm and every steep Blackens as wakes each pharos-shine “I roam, but one is safely mine,” I say. “God grant she stay my own!” Low laughs the wind as if it grinned: “Thy Love is one thou'st not yet known.’ Rewritten from an old copy. DURING WIND AND RAIN They sing their dearest songs— He, she, all of them—yea, Treble and tenor and bass, And one to play; With the candles mooning each face . . . . Ah, no; the years O! How the sick leaves reel down in throngs! They clear the creeping moss— Elders and juniors—aye, Making the pathways neat And the garden gay; And they build a shady seat . . . . Ah, no; the years, the years; See, the white storm-birds wing across! They are blithely breakfasting all— Men and maidens—yea, Under the summer tree, With a glimpse of the bay, While pet fowl come to the knee . . . . Ah, no; the years O! And the rotten rose is ript from the wall. They change to a high new house, He, she, all of them—aye, Clocks and carpets and chairs On the lawn all day, And brightest things that are theirs . . . . Ah, no; the years, the years; Down their carved names the rain-drop ploughs. HE PREFERS HER EARTHLY This after-sunset is a sight for seeing, Cliff-heads of craggy cloud surrounding it. —And dwell you in that glory-show? You may; for there are strange strange things in being, Stranger than I know. Yet if that chasm of splendour claim your presence Which glows between the ash cloud and the dun, How changed must be your mortal mould! Changed to a firmament-riding earthless essence From what you were of old: All too unlike the fond and fragile creature Then known to me . . . . Well, shall I say it plain? I would not have you thus and there, But still would grieve on, missing you, still feature You as the one you were. THE DOLLS “Whenever you dress me dolls, mammy, Why do you dress them so, And make them gallant soldiers, When never a one I know; And not as gentle ladies With frills and frocks and curls, As people dress the dollies Of other little girls?” Ah—why did she not answer:— “Because your mammy's heed Is always gallant soldiers, As well may be, indeed. One of them was your daddy, His name I must not tell; He's not the dad who lives here, But one I love too well.” MOLLY GONE No more summer for Molly and me; There is snow on the tree, And the blackbirds plump large as the rooks are, almost, And the water is hard Where they used to dip bills at the dawn ere her figure was lost To these coasts, now my prison close-barred. No more planting by Molly and me Where the beds used to be Of sweet-william; no training the clambering rose By the framework of fir Now bowering the pathway, whereon it swings gaily and blows As if calling commendment from her. No more jauntings by Molly and me To the town by the sea, Or along over Whitesheet to Wynyard's green Gap, Catching Montacute Crest To the right against Sedgmoor, and Corton-Hill's far-distant cap, And Pilsdon and Lewsdon to west. No more singing by Molly to me In the evenings when she Was in mood and in voice, and the candles were lit, And past the porch-quoin The rays would spring out on the laurels; and dumbledores hit On the pane, as if wishing to join. Where, then, is Molly, who's no more with me? —As I stand on this lea, Thinking thus, there's a many-flamed star in the air, That tosses a sign That her glance is regarding its face from her home, so that there Her eyes may have meetings with mine. A BACKWARD SPRING The trees are afraid to put forth buds, And there is timidity in the grass; The plots lie gray where gouged by spuds, And whether next week will pass Free of sly sour winds is the fret of each bush Of barberry waiting to bloom. Yet the snowdrop's face betrays no gloom, And the primrose pants in its heedless push, Though the myrtle asks if it's worth the fight This year with frost and rime To venture one more time On delicate leaves and buttons of white From the selfsame bough as at last year's prime, And never to ruminate on or remember What happened to it in mid-December. April 1917. LOOKING ACROSS I It is dark in the sky, And silence is where Our laughs rang high; And recall do I That One is out there. II The dawn is not nigh, And the trees are bare, And the waterways sigh That a year has drawn by, And Two are out there. III The wind drops to die Like the phantom of Care Too frail for a cry, And heart brings to eye That Three are out there. IV This Life runs dry That once ran rare And rosy in dye, And fleet the days fly, And Four are out there. V Tired, tired am I Of this earthly air, And my wraith asks: Why, Since these calm lie, Are not Five out there? December 1915. AT A SEASIDE TOWN IN 1869 (Young Lover's Reverie) I went and stood outside myself, Spelled the dark sky And ship-lights nigh, And grumbling winds that passed thereby. Then next inside myself I looked, And there, above All, shone my Love, That nothing matched the image of. Beyond myself again I ranged; And saw the free Life by the sea, And folk indifferent to me. O 'twas a charm to draw within Thereafter, where But she was; care For one thing only, her hid there. But so it chanced, without myself I had to look, And then I took More heed of what I had long forsook: The boats, the sands, the esplanade, The laughing crowd; Light-hearted, loud Greetings from some not ill-endowed: The evening sunlit cliffs, the talk, Hailings and halts, The keen sea-salts, The band, the Morgenblätter Waltz Still, when at night I drew inside Forward she came, Sad, but the same As when I first had known her name Then rose a time when, as by force, Outwardly wooed By contacts crude, Her image in abeyance stood . . . . At last I said; This outside life Shall not endure; I'll seek the pure Thought-world, and bask in her allure. Myself again I crept within, Scanned with keen care The temple where She'd shone, but could not find her there. I sought and sought. But O her soul Has not since thrown Upon my own One beam! Yea, she is gone, is gone. From an old note. THE GLIMPSE She sped through the door And, following in haste, And stirred to the core, I entered hot-faced; But I could not find her, No sign was behind her. “Where is she?” I said: —“Who?” they asked that sat there; “Not a soul's come in sight.” —“A maid with red hair.” —“Ah.” They paled. “She is dead. People see her at night, But you are the first On whom she has burst In the keen common light.” It was ages ago, When I was quite strong: I have waited since,—O, I have waited so long! —Yea, I set me to own The house, where now lone I dwell in void rooms Booming hollow as tombs! But I never come near her, Though nightly I hear her. And my cheek has grown thin And my hair has grown gray With this waiting therein; But she still keeps away! THE PEDESTRIAN AN INCIDENT OF 1883 “Sir, will you let me give you a ride? Nox venit, and the heath is wide.” —My phaeton-lantern shone on one Young, fair, even fresh, But burdened with flesh: A leathern satchel at his side, His breathings short, his coat undone. 'Twas as if his corpulent figure slopped With the shake of his walking when he stopped, And, though the night's pinch grew acute, He wore but a thin Wind-thridded suit, Yet well-shaped shoes for walking in, Artistic beaver, cane gold-topped. “Alas, my friend,” he said with a smile, “I am daily bound to foot ten mile— Wet, dry, or dark—before I rest. Six months to live My doctors give Me as my prospect here, at best, Unless I vamp my sturdiest!” His voice was that of a man refined, A man, one well could feel, of mind, Quite winning in its musical ease; But in mould maligned By some disease; And I asked again. But he shook his head; Then, as if more were due, he said:— “A student was I—of Schopenhauer, Kant, Hegel,—and the fountained bower Of the Muses, too, knew my regard: But ah—I fear me The grave gapes near me! . . . Would I could this gross sheath discard, And rise an ethereal shape, unmarred!” How I remember him!—his short breath, His aspect, marked for early death, As he dropped into the night for ever; One caught in his prime Of high endeavour; From all philosophies soon to sever Through an unconscienced trick of Time! “WHO'S IN THE NEXT ROOM?” “Who's in the next room?—who? I seemed to see Somebody in the dawning passing through, Unknown to me.” “Nay: you saw nought. He passed invisibly.” “Who's in the next room?—who? I seem to hear Somebody muttering firm in a language new That chills the ear.” “No: you catch not his tongue who has entered there.” “Who's in the next room?—who? I seem to feel His breath like a clammy draught, as if it drew From the Polar Wheel.” “No: none who breathes at all does the door conceal.” “Who's in the next room?—who? A figure wan With a message to one in there of something due? Shall I know him anon?” “Yea he; and he brought such; and you'll know him anon.” AT A COUNTRY FAIR At a bygone Western country fair I saw a giant led by a dwarf With a red string like a long thin scarf; How much he was the stronger there The giant seemed unaware. And then I saw that the giant was blind, And the dwarf a shrewd-eyed little thing; The giant, mild, timid, obeyed the string As if he had no independent mind, Or will of any kind. Wherever the dwarf decided to go At his heels the other trotted meekly, (Perhaps—I know not—reproaching weakly) Like one Fate bade that it must be so, Whether he wished or no. Various sights in various climes I have seen, and more I may see yet, But that sight never shall I forget, And have thought it the sorriest of pantomimes, If once, a hundred times! THE MEMORIAL BRASS: 186? “Why do you weep there, O sweet lady, Why do you weep before that brass?— (I'm a mere student sketching the mediaeval) Is some late death lined there, alas?— Your father's? . . . Well, all pay the debt that paid he!” “Young man, O must I tell!—My husband's! And under His name I set mine, and my death!— Its date left vacant till my heirs should fill it, Stating me faithful till my last breath.” —“Madam, that you are a widow wakes my wonder!” “O wait! For last month I—remarried! And now I fear 'twas a deed amiss. We've just come home. And I am sick and saddened At what the new one will say to this; And will he think—think that I should have tarried? “I may add, surely,—with no wish to harm him— That he's a temper—yes, I fear! And when he comes to church next Sunday morning, And sees that written . . . O dear, O dear!” —“Madam, I swear your beauty will disarm him!” HER LOVE-BIRDS When I looked up at my love-birds That Sunday afternoon, There was in their tiny tune A dying fetch like broken words, When I looked up at my love-birds That Sunday afternoon. When he, too, scanned the love-birds On entering there that day, 'Twas as if he had nought to say Of his long journey citywards, When he, too, scanned the love-birds, On entering there that day. And billed and billed the love-birds, As 'twere in fond despair At the stress of silence where Had once been tones in tenor thirds, And billed and billed the love-birds As 'twere in fond despair. O, his speech that chilled the love-birds, And smote like death on me, As I learnt what was to be, And knew my life was broke in sherds! O, his speech that chilled the love-birds, And smote like death on me! PAYING CALLS I went by footpath and by stile Beyond where bustle ends, Strayed here a mile and there a mile And called upon some friends. On certain ones I had not seen For years past did I call, And then on others who had been The oldest friends of all. It was the time of midsummer When they had used to roam; But now, though tempting was the air, I found them all at home. I spoke to one and other of them By mound and stone and tree Of things we had done ere days were dim, But they spoke not to me. THE UPPER BIRCH-LEAVES Warm yellowy-green In the blue serene, How they skip and sway On this autumn day! They cannot know What has happened below,— That their boughs down there Are already quite bare, That their own will be When a week has passed,— For they jig as in glee To this very last. But no; there lies At times in their tune A note that cries What at first I fear I did not hear: “O we remember At each wind's hollo— Though life holds yet— We go hence soon, For 'tis November; —But that you follow You may forget!” “IT NEVER LOOKS LIKE SUMMER” “It never looks like summer here On Beeny by the sea.” But though she saw its look as drear, Summer it seemed to me. It never looks like summer now Whatever weather's there; But ah, it cannot anyhow, On Beeny or elsewhere! Boscastle. March 8, 1913. EVERYTHING COMES “The house is bleak and cold Built so new for me! All the winds upon the wold Search it through for me; No screening trees abound, And the curious eyes around, Keep on view for me.” “My Love, I am planting trees As a screen for you Both from winds, and eyes that tease And peer in for you. Only wait till they have grown, No such bower will be known As I mean for you.” “Then I will bear it, Love, And will wait,” she said. —So, with years, there grew a grove. “Skill how great!” she said. “As you wished, Dear?”—“Yes, I see! But—I'm dying; and for me 'Tis too late,” she said. THE MAN WITH A PAST There was merry-making When the first dart fell As a heralding,— Till grinned the fully bared thing, And froze like a spell— Like a spell. Innocent was she, Innocent was I, Too simple we! Before us we did not see, Nearing, aught wry— Aught wry! I can tell it not now, It was long ago; And such things cow; But that is why and how Two lives were so— Were so. Yes, the years matured, And the blows were three That time ensured On her, which she dumbly endured; And one on me— One on me. HE FEARS HIS GOOD FORTUNE There was a glorious time At an epoch of my prime; Mornings beryl-bespread, And evenings golden-red; Nothing gray: And in my heart I said, “However this chanced to be, It is too full for me, Too rare, too rapturous, rash, Its spell must close with a crash Some day!” The radiance went on Anon and yet anon, And sweetness fell around Like manna on the ground. “I've no claim,” Said I, “to be thus crowned: I am not worthy this:— Must it not go amiss?— Well . . . let the end foreseen Come duly!—I am serene.” —And it came. HE WONDERS ABOUT HIMSELF No use hoping, or feeling vext, Tugged by a force above or under Like some fantocine, much I wonder What I shall find me doing next! Shall I be rushing where bright eyes be? Shall I be suffering sorrows seven? Shall I be watching the stars of heaven, Thinking one of them looks like thee? Part is mine of the general Will, Cannot my share in the sum of sources Bend a digit the poise of forces, And a fair desire fulfil? Nov. 1893. JUBILATE “The very last time I ever was here,” he said, “I saw much less of the quick than I saw of the dead.” —He was a man I had met with somewhere before, But how or when I now could recall no more. “The hazy mazy moonlight at one in the morning Spread out as a sea across the frozen snow, Glazed to live sparkles like the great breastplate adorning The priest of the Temple, with Urim and Thummim aglow. “The yew-tree arms, glued hard to the stiff stark air, Hung still in the village sky as theatre-scenes When I came by the churchyard wall, and halted there At a shut-in sound of fiddles and tambourines. “And as I stood hearkening, dulcimers, hautboys, and shawms, And violoncellos, and a three-stringed double-bass, Joined in, and were intermixed with a singing of psalms; And I looked over at the dead men's dwelling-place. “Through the shine of the slippery snow I now could see, As it were through a crystal roof, a great company Of the dead minueting in stately step underground To the tune of the instruments I had before heard sound. “It was ‘Eden New,’ and dancing they sang in a chore, ‘We are out of it all!—yea, in Little-Ease cramped no more!” And their shrouded figures pacing with joy I could see As you see the stage from the gallery. And they had no heed of me. “And I lifted my head quite dazed from the churchyard wall And I doubted not that it warned I should soon have my call. But—” . . . Then in the ashes he emptied the dregs of his cup, And onward he went, and the darkness swallowed him up. HE REVISITS HIS FIRST SCHOOL I should not have shown in the flesh, I ought to have gone as a ghost; It was awkward, unseemly almost, Standing solidly there as when fresh, Pink, tiny, crisp-curled, My pinions yet furled From the winds of the world. After waiting so many a year To wait longer, and go as a sprite From the tomb at the mid of some night Was the right, radiant way to appear; Not as one wanzing weak From life's roar and reek, His rest still to seek: Yea, beglimpsed through the quaint quarried glass Of green moonlight, by me greener made, When they'd cry, perhaps, “There sits his shade In his olden haunt—just as he was When in Walkingame he Conned the grand Rule-of-Three With the bent of a bee.” But to show in the afternoon sun, With an aspect of hollow-eyed care, When none wished to see me come there, Was a garish thing, better undone. Yes; wrong was the way; But yet, let me say, I may right it—some day. “I THOUGHT, MY HEART” I thought, my Heart, that you had healed Of those sore smartings of the past, And that the summers had oversealed All mark of them at last. But closely scanning in the night I saw them standing crimson-bright Just as she made them: Nothing could fade them; Yea, I can swear That there they were— They still were there! Then the Vision of her who cut them came, And looking over my shoulder said, “I am sure you deal me all the blame For those sharp smarts and red; But meet me, dearest, to-morrow night, In the churchyard at the moon's half-height, And so strange a kiss Shall be mine, I wis, That you'll cease to know If the wounds you show Be there or no!” FRAGMENT [At last I entered a long dark gallery] At last I entered a long dark gallery, Catacomb-lined; and ranged at the side Were the bodies of men from far and wide Who, motion past, were nevertheless not dead. “The sense of waiting here strikes strong; Everyone's waiting, waiting, it seems to me; What are you waiting for so long?— What is to happen?” I said. “O we are waiting for one called God,” said they, “(Though by some the Will, or Force, or Laws; And, vaguely, by some, the Ultimate Cause;) Waiting for him to see us before we are clay. Yes; waiting, waiting, for God to know it.” . . . “To know what?” questioned I. “To know how things have been going on earth and below it: It is clear he must know some day.” I thereon asked them why. “Since he made us humble pioneers Of himself in consciousness of Life's tears, It needs no mighty prophecy To tell that what he could mindlessly show His creatures, he himself will know. “By some still close-cowled mystery We have reached feeling faster than he, But he will overtake us anon, If the world goes on.” MIDNIGHT ON THE GREAT WESTERN In the third-class seat sat the journeying boy, And the roof-lamp's oily flame Played down on his listless form and face, Bewrapt past knowing to what he was going, Or whence he came. In the band of his hat the journeying boy Had a ticket stuck; and a string Around his neck bore the key of his box, That twinkled gleams of the lamp's sad beams Like a living thing. What past can be yours, O journeying boy Towards a world unknown, Who calmly, as if incurious quite On all at stake, can undertake This plunge alone? Knows your soul a sphere, O journeying boy, Our rude realms far above, Whence with spacious vision you mark and mete This region of sin that you find you in, But are not of? HONEYMOON TIME AT AN INN At the shiver of morning, a little before the false dawn, The moon was at the window-square, Deedily brooding in deformed decay— The curve hewn off her cheek as by an adze; At the shiver of morning a little before the false dawn So the moon looked in there. Her speechless eyeing reached across the chamber, Where lay two souls opprest, One a white lady sighing, “Why am I sad!” To him who sighed back, “Sad, my Love, am I!” And speechlessly the old moon conned the chamber, And these two reft of rest. While their large-pupilled vision swept the scene there, Nought seeming imminent, Something fell sheer, and crashed, and from the floor Lay glittering at the pair with a shattered gaze, While their large-pupilled vision swept the scene there, And the many-eyed thing outleant. With a start they saw that it was an old-time pier-glass Which had stood on the mantel near, Its silvering blemished,—yes, as if worn away By the eyes of the countless dead who had smirked at it Ere these two ever knew that old-time pier-glass And its vague and vacant leer. As he looked, his bride like a moth skimmed forth, and kneeling Quick, with quivering sighs, Gathered the pieces under the moon's sly ray, Unwitting as an automaton what she did; Till he entreated, hasting to where she was kneeling, “Let it stay where it lies!” “Long years of sorrow this means!” breathed the lady As they retired. “Alas!” And she lifted one pale hand across her eyes. “Don't trouble, Love; it's nothing,” the bridegroom said. “Long years of sorrow for us!” murmured the lady, “Or ever this evil pass!” And the Spirits Ironic laughed behind the wainscot, And the Spirits of Pity sighed. “It's good,” said the Spirits Ironic, “to tickle their minds With a portent of their wedlock's aftergrinds.” And the Spirits of Pity sighed behind the wainscot, “It's a portent we cannot abide! “More, what shall happen to prove the truth of the portent?” —“Oh; in brief, they will fade till old, And their loves grow numbed ere death, by the cark of care. —“But nought see we that asks for portents there?— Tis the lot of all.”—“Well, no less true is a portent That it fits all mortal mould.” THE ROBIN When up aloft I fly and fly, I see in pools The shining sky, And a happy bird Am I, am I! When I descend Towards their brink I stand, and look, And stoop, and drink, And bathe my wings, And chink and prink. When winter frost Makes earth as steel I search and search But find no meal, And most unhappy Then I feel. But when it lasts, And snows still fall, I get to feel No grief at all, For I turn to a cold stiff Feathery ball! “I ROSE AND WENT TO ROU'TOR TOWN” (She, alone) I rose and went to Rou'tor Town With gaiety and good heart, And ardour for the start, That morning ere the moon was down That lit me off to Rou'tor Town With gaiety and good heart. When sojourn soon at Rou'tor Town Wrote sorrows on my face, I strove that none should trace The pale and gray, once pink and brown, When sojourn soon at Rou'tor Town Wrote sorrows on my face. The evil wrought at Rou'tor Town On him I'd loved so true I cannot tell anew: But nought can quench, but nought can drown The evil wrought at Rou'tor Town On him I'd loved so true! THE NETTLES This, then, is the grave of my son, Whose heart she won! And nettles grow Upon his mound; and she lives just below. How he upbraided me, and left, And our lives were cleft, because I said She was hard, unfeeling, caring but to wed. Well, to see this sight I have fared these miles, And her firelight smiles from her window there, Whom he left his mother to cherish with tender care! It is enough. I'll turn and go; Yes, nettles grow where lone lies he, Who spurned me for seeing what he could not see. IN A WAITING-ROOM On a morning sick as the day of doom With the drizzling gray Of an English May, There were few in the railway waiting-room. About its walls were framed and varnished Pictures of liners, fly-blown, tarnished. The table bore a Testament For travellers' reading, if suchwise bent. I read it on and on, And, thronging the Gospel of Saint John, Were figures—additions, multiplications— By some one scrawled, with sundry emendations; Not scoffingly designed, But with an absent mind,— Plainly a bagman's counts of cost, What he had profited, what lost; And whilst I wondered if there could have been Any particle of a soul In that poor man at all, To cypher rates of wage Upon that printed page, There joined in the charmless scene And stood over me and the scribbled book (To lend the hour's mean hue A smear of tragedy too) A soldier and wife, with haggard look Subdued to stone by strong endeavour; And then I heard From a casual word They were parting as they believed for ever. But next there came Like the eastern flame Of some high altar, children—a pair— Who laughed at the fly-blown pictures there. “Here are the lovely ships that we, Mother, are by and by going to see! When we get there it's 'most sure to be fine, And the band will play, and the sun will shine!” It rained on the skylight with a din As we waited and still no train came in; But the words of the child in the squalid room Had spread a glory through the gloom. THE CLOCK-WINDER It is dark as a cave, Or a vault in the nave When the iron door Is closed, and the floor Of the church relaid With trowel and spade. But the parish-clerk Cares not for the dark As he winds in the tower At a regular hour The rheumatic clock Whose dilatory knock You can hear when praying At the day's decaying, Or at any lone while From a pew in the aisle. Up, up from the ground Around and around In the turret stair He clambers, to where The wheelwork is, With its tick, click, whizz, Reposefully measuring Each day to its end That mortal men spend In sorrowing and pleasuring. Nightly thus does he climb To the trackway of Time. Him I followed one night To this place without light, And, ere I spoke, heard Him say, word by word, At the end of his winding, The darkness unminding:— “So I wipe out one more, My Dear, of the sore Sad days that still be, Like a drying Dead Sea, Between you and me!” Who she was no man knew: He had long borne him blind To all womankind; And was ever one who Kept his past out of view. OLD EXCURSIONS “What's the good of going to Ridgeway, Cerne, or Sydling Mill, Or to Yell'ham Hill, Blithely bearing Casterbridge-way As we used to do? She will no more climb up there, Or be visible anywhere In those haunts we knew.” But to-night, while walking weary, Near me seemed her shade, Come as 'twere to upbraid This my mood in deeming dreary Scenes that used to please; And, if she did come to me, Still solicitous, there may be Good in going to these. So, I'll care to roam to Ridgeway, Cerne, or Sydling Mill, Or to Yell'ham Hill, Blithely bearing Casterbridge-way As we used to do. Since her phasm may flit out there, And may greet me anywhere In those haunts we knew. April 1913. THE MASKED FACE I found me in a great surging space, At either end a door, And I said: “What is this giddying place, With no firm-fixéd floor, That I knew not of before?” “It is Life,” said a mask-clad face. I asked: “But how do I come here, Who never wished to come; Can the light and air be made more clear, The floor more quietsome, And the doors set wide? They numb Fast-locked, and fill with fear.” The mask put on a bleak smile then, And said, “O vassal-wight, There once complained a goosequill pen To the scribe of the Infinite Of the words it had to write Because they were past its ken.” IN A WHISPERING GALLERY That whisper takes the voice Of a Spirit's compassionings, Close, but invisible, And throws me under a spell At the kindling vision it brings; And for a moment I rejoice, And believe in transcendent things That would mould from this muddy earth A spot for the splendid birth Of everlasting lives, Whereto no night arrives; And this gaunt gray gallery A tabernacle of worth On this drab-aired afternoon, When you can barely see Across its hazed lacune If opposite aught there be Of fleshed humanity Wherewith I may commune; Or if the voice so near Be a soul's voice floating here. THE SOMETHING THAT SAVED HIM It was when Whirls of thick waters laved me Again and again, That something arose and saved me; Yea, it was then. In that day Unseeing the azure went I On my way, And to white winter bent I, Knowing no May. Reft of renown, Under the night clouds beating Up and down, In my needfulness greeting Cit and clown. Long there had been Much of a murky colour In the scene, Dull prospects meeting duller; Nought between. Last, there loomed A closing-in blind alley, Though there boomed A feeble summons to rally Where it gloomed. The clock rang; The hour brought a hand to deliver; I upsprang, And looked back at den, ditch and river, And sang. THE ENEMY'S PORTRAIT He saw the portrait of his enemy, offered At auction in a street he journeyed nigh, That enemy, now late dead, who in his lifetime Had injured deeply him the passer-by. “To get that picture, pleased be God, I'll try, And utterly destroy it; and no more Shall be inflicted on man's mortal eye A countenance so sinister and sore!” And so he bought the painting. Driving homeward, “The frame will come in useful,” he declared, “The rest is fuel.” On his arrival, weary, Asked what he bore with him, and how he fared, He said he had bid for a picture, though he cared For the frame only: on the morrow he Would burn the canvas, which could well be spared, Seeing that it portrayed his enemy. Next day some other duty found him busy: The foe was laid his face against the wall; But on the next he set himself to loosen The straining-strips. And then a casual call Prevented his proceeding therewithal; And thus the picture waited, day by day, Its owner's pleasure, like a wretched thrall, Until a month and more had slipped away. And then upon a morn he found it shifted, Hung in a corner by a servitor. “Why did you take on you to hang that picture? You know it was the frame I bought it for.” “It stood in the way of every visitor, And I just hitched it there.”—“Well, it must go: I don't commemorate men whom I abhor. Remind me 'tis to do. The frame I'll stow.” But things become forgotten. In the shadow Of the dark corner hung it by its string, And there it stayed—once noticed by its owner, Who said, “Ah me—I' must destroy that thing!” But when he died, there, none remembering, It hung, till moved to prominence, as one sees; And comers pause and say, examining, “I thought they were the bitterest enemies?” IMAGININGS She saw herself a lady With fifty frocks in wear, And rolling wheels, and rooms the best, And faithful maidens' care, And open lawns and shady For weathers warm or drear. She found herself a striver, All liberal gifts debarred, With days of gloom, and movements stressed, And early visions marred, And got no man to wive her But one whose lot was hard. Yet in the moony night-time She steals to stile and lea During his heavy slumberous rest When homecome wearily, And dreams of some blest bright-time She knows can never be. ON THE DOORSTEP The rain imprinted the step's wet shine With target-circles that quivered and crossed As I was leaving this porch of mine; When from within there swelled and paused A song's sweet note; And back I turned, and thought, “Here I'll abide.” The step shines wet beneath the rain, Which prints its circles as heretofore: I watch them from the porch again, But no song-notes within the door Now call to me To shun the dripping lea; And forth I stride. Jan. 1914. SIGNS AND TOKENS Said the red-cloaked crone In a whispered moan: “The dead man was limp When laid in his chest; Yea, limp; and why But to signify That the grave will crimp Ere next year's sun Yet another one Of those in that house— It may be the best— For its endless drowse!” Said the brown-shawled dame To confirm the same: “And the slothful flies On the rotting fruit Have been seen to wear While crawling there Crape scarves, by eyes That were quick and acute; As did those that had pitched On the cows by the pails, And with flaps of their tails Were far away switched.” Said the third in plaid, Each word being weighed: “And trotting does In the park, in the lane, And just outside The shuttered pane, Have also been heard— Quick feet as light As the feet of a sprite— And the wise mind knows What things may betide When such has occurred.” Cried the black-craped fourth, Cold faced as the north: “O, though giving such Some head-room, I smile At your falterings When noting those things Round your domicile! For what, what can touch One whom, riven of all That makes life gay, No hints can appal Of more takings away!” PATHS OF FORMER TIME No; no; It must not be so: They are the ways we do not go. Still chew The kine, and moo In the meadows we used to wander through; Still purl The rivulets and curl Towards the weirs with a musical swirl; Haymakers As in former years Rake rolls into heaps that the pitchfork rears; Wheels crack On the turfy track The waggon pursues with its toppling pack. “Why then shun— Since summer's not done— All this because of the lack of one?” Had you been Sharer of that scene You would not ask while it bites in keen Why it is so We can no more go By the summer paths we used to know! 1913. THE CLOCK OF THE YEARS “A spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up.” And the Spirit said, “I can make the clock of the years go backward, But am loth to stop it where you will.” And I cried, “Agreed To that. Proceed: It's better than dead!” He answered, “Peace”; And called her up—as last before me; Then younger, younger she freshed, to the year I first had known Her woman-grown, And I cried, “Cease!— “Thus far is good— It is enough—let her stay thus always!” But alas for me—He shook his head: No stop was there; And she waned child-fair, And to babyhood. Still less in mien To my great sorrow became she slowly, And smalled till she was nought at all In his checkless griff; And it was as if She had never been. “Better,” I plained, “She were dead as before! The memory of her Had lived in me; but it cannot now!” And coldly his voice: “It was your choice To mar the ordained.” 1916. AT THE PIANO A woman was playing, A man looking on; And the mould of her face, And her neck, and her hair, Which the rays fell upon Of the two candles there, Sent him mentally straying In some fancy-place Where pain had no trace. A cowled Apparition Came pushing between; And her notes seemed to sigh; And the lights to burn pale, As a spell numbed the scene. But the maid saw no bale, And the man no monition; And Time laughed awry, And the. Phantom hid nigh. THE SHADOW ON THE STONE I went by the Druid stone That broods in the garden white and lone, And I stopped and looked at the shifting shadows That at some moments fall thereon From the tree hard by with a rhythmic swing, And they shaped in my imagining To the shade that a well-known head and shoulders Threw there when she was gardening. I thought her behind my back, Yea, her I long had learned to lack, And I said: “I am sure you are standing behind me, Though how do you get into this old track?” And there was no sound but the fall of a leaf As a sad response; and to keep down grief I would not turn my head to discover That there was nothing in my belief. Yet I wanted to look and see That nobody stood at the back of me; But I thought once more: “Nay, I'll not unvision A shape which, somehow, there may be.” So I went on softly from the glade, And left her behind me throwing her shade, As she were indeed an apparition— My head unturned lest my dream should fade. Begun 1913: finished 1916. IN THE GARDEN (M. H.) We waited for the sun To break its cloudy prison (For day was not yet done, And night still unbegun) Leaning by the dial. After many a trial— We all silent there— It burst as new-arisen, Throwing a shade to where Time travelled at that minute. Little saw we in it, But this much I know, Of lookers on that shade, Her towards whom it made Soonest had to go. 1915. THE TREE AND THE LADY I have done all I could For that lady I knew! Through the heats I have shaded her, Drawn to her songsters when summer has jaded her, Home from the heath or the wood. At the mirth-time of May, When my shadow first lured her, I'd donned my new bravery Of greenth: 'twas my all. Now I shiver in slavery, Icicles grieving me gray. Plumed to every twig's end I could tempt her chair under me. Much did I treasure her During those days she had nothing to pleasure her; Mutely she used me as friend. I'm a skeleton now, And she's gone, craving warmth. The rime sticks like a skin to me; Through me Arcturus peers; Nor'lights shoot into me; Gone is she, scorning my bough! AN UPBRAIDING Now I am dead you sing to me The songs we used to know, But while I lived you had no wish Or care for doing so. Now I am dead you come to me In the moonlight, comfortless; Ah, what would I have given alive To win such tenderness! When you are dead, and stand to me Not differenced, as now, But like again, will you be cold As when we lived, or how? THE YOUNG GLASS-STAINER These Gothic windows, how they wear me out With cusp and foil, and nothing straight or square, Crude colours, leaden borders roundabout, And fitting in Peter here, and Matthew there! “What a vocation! Here do I draw now The abnormal, loving the Hellenic norm; Martha I paint, and dream of Hera's brow, Mary, and think of Aphrodite's form.” Nov. 1893. LOOKING AT A PICTURE ON AN ANNIVERSARY But don't you know it, my dear, Don't you know it, That this day of the year (What rainbow-rays embow it!) We met, strangers confessed, But parted—blest? Though at this query, my dear, There in your frame Unmoved you still appear, You must be thinking the same, But keep that look demure Just to allure. And now at length a trace I surely vision Upon that wistful face Of old-time recognition, Smiling forth, “Yes, as you say, It is the day.” For this one phase of you Now left on earth This great date must endue With pulsings of rebirth?— I see them vitalize Those two deep eyes! But if this face I con Does not declare Consciousness living on Still in it, little I care To live myself, my dear, Lone-labouring here! Spring 1913. THE CHOIRMASTER'S BURIAL He often would ask us That, when he died, After playing so many To their last rest, If out of us any Should here abide, And it would not task us, We would with our lutes Play over him By his grave-brim The psalm he liked best— The one whose sense suits “Mount Ephraim”— And perhaps we should seem To him, in Death's dream, Like the seraphim. As soon as I knew That his spirit was gone I thought this his due, And spoke thereupon. “I think,” said the vicar, “A read service quicker Than viols out-of-doors In these frosts and hoars. That old-fashioned way Requires a fine day, And it seems to me It had better not be.” Hence, that afternoon, Though never knew he That his wish could not be, To get through it faster They buried the master Without any tune. But 'twas said that, when At the dead of next night The vicar looked out, There struck on his ken Thronged roundabout, Where the frost was graying The headstoned grass, A band all in white Like the saints in church-glass, Singing and playing The ancient stave By the choirmaster's grave. Such the tenor man told When he had grown old. THE MAN WHO FORGOT At a lonely cross where bye-roads met I sat upon a gate; I saw the sun decline and set, And still was fain to wait. A trotting boy passed up the way And roused me from my thought; I called to him, and showed where lay A spot I shyly sought. “A summer-house fair stands hidden where You see the moonlight thrown; Go, tell me if within it there A lady sits alone.’ He half demurred, but took the track, And silence held the scene; I saw his figure rambling back; I asked him if he had been. “I went just where you said, but found No summer-house was there: Beyond the slope 'tis all bare ground; Nothing stands anywhere. “A man asked what my brains were worth; The house, he said, grew rotten, And was pulled down before my birth, And is almost forgotten!” My right mind woke, and I stood dumb; Forty years' frost and flower Had fleeted since I'd used to come To meet her in that bower. WHILE DRAWING IN A CHURCHYARD “It is sad that so many of worth, Still in the flesh,” soughed the yew, “Misjudge their lot whom kindly earth Secludes from view. “They ride their diurnal round Each day-span's sum of hours In peerless ease, without jolt or bound Or ache like ours. “If the living could but hear What is heard by my roots as they creep Round the restful flock, and the things said there No one would weep.” “‘Now set among the wise,’ They say: ‘Enlarged in scope, That no God trumpet us to rise We truly hope.’” I listened to his strange tale In the mood that stillness brings, And I grew to accept as the day wore pale That show of things. “FOR LIFE I HAD NEVER CARED GREATLY” For Life I had never cared greatly, As worth a man's while; Peradventures unsought, Peradventures that finished in nought, Had kept me from youth and through manhood till lately Unwon by its style. In earliest years—why I know not— I viewed it askance; Conditions of doubt, Conditions that leaked slowly out, May haply have bent me to stand and to show not Much zest for its dance. With symphonies soft and sweet colour It courted me then, Till evasions seemed wrong, Till evasions gave in to its song, And I warmed, until living aloofly loomed duller Than life among men. Anew I found nought to set eyes on, When, lifting its hand, It uncloaked a star, Uncloaked it from fog-damps afar, And showed its beams burning from pole to horizon As bright as a brand. And so, the rough highway forgetting, I pace hill and dale Regarding the sky, Regarding the vision on high, And thus re-illumed have no humour for letting My pilgrimage fail. POEMS OF WAR AND PATRIOTISM “MEN WHO MARCH AWAY” (SONG OF THE SOLDIERS) What of the faith and fire within us Men who march away Ere the barn-cocks say Night is growing gray, Leaving all that here can win us; What of the faith and fire within us Men who march away? Is it a purblind prank, O think you, Friend with the musing eye, Who watch us stepping by With doubt and dolorous sigh? Can much pondering so hoodwink you! Is it a purblind prank, O think you, Friend with the musing eye? Nay. We well see what we are doing, Though some may not see— Dalliers as they be— England's need are we; Her distress would leave us rueing: Nay. We well see what we are doing, Though some may not see! In our heart of hearts believing Victory crowns the just, And that braggarts must Surely bite the dust, Press we to the field ungrieving, In our heart of hearts believing Victory crowns the just. Hence the faith and fire within us Men who march away Ere the barn-cocks say Night is growing gray, Leaving all that here can win us; Hence the faith and fire within us Men who march away. September 5, 1914. HIS COUNTRY I journeyed from my native spot Across the south sea shine, And found that people in hall and cot Laboured and suffered each his lot Even as I did mine. He travels southward, and looks around; Thus noting them in meads and marts It did not seem to me That my dear country with its hearts, Minds, yearnings, worse and better parts Had ended with the sea. and cannot discover the boundary I further and further went anon, As such I still surveyed, And further yet—yea, on and on, And all the men I looked upon Had heart-strings fellow-made. of his native country; I traced the whole terrestrial round, Homing the other side; Then said I, “What is there to bound My denizenship? It seems I have found Its scope to be world-wide.” or where his duties to his fellow-creatures end; I asked me: “Whom have I to fight, And whom have I to dare, And whom to weaken, crush, and blight? My country seems to have kept in sight nor who are his enemies.On my way everywhere.” 1913. ENGLAND TO GERMANY IN 1914 “O England, may God punish thee!” —Is it that Teuton genius flowers Only to breathe malignity Upon its friend of earlier hours? —We have eaten your bread, you have eaten ours, We have loved your burgs, your pines' green moan, Fair Rhine-stream, and its storied towers; Your shining souls of deathless dowers Have won us as they were our own: We have nursed no dreams to shed your blood, We have matched your might not rancorously Save a flushed few whose blatant mood You heard and marked as well as we To tongue not in their country's key; But yet you cry with face aflame, “O England, may God punish thee!” And foul in onward history, And present sight, your ancient name. Autumn 1914. ON THE BELGIAN EXPATRIATION I dreamt that people from the Land of Chimes Arrived one autumn morning wih their bells, To hoist them on the towers and citadels Of my own country, that the musical rhymes Rung by them into space at meted times Amid the market's daily stir and stress, And the night's empty star-lit silentness, Might solace souls of this and kindred climes. Then I awoke; and lo, before me stood The visioned ones, but pale and full of fear; From Bruges they came, and Antwerp, and Ostend, No carillons in their train. Foes of mad mood Had shattered these to shards amid the gear Of ravaged roof, and smouldering gable-end. October 18, 1914. AN APPEAL TO AMERICA ON BEHALF OF THE BELGIAN DESTITUTE Seven millions stand Emaciate, in that ancient Delta-land:— We here, full-charged with our own maimed and dead And coiled in throbbing conflicts slow and sore, Can poorly soothe these ails unmerited Of souls forlorn upon the facing shore!— Where naked, gaunt, in endless band on band Seven millions stand. No man can say To your great country that, with scant delay, You must, perforce, ease them in their loud need: We know that nearer first your duty lies; But—is it much to ask that you let plead Your lovingkindness with you—wooing-wise— Albeit that aught you owe, and must repay, No man can say? December 1914. THE PITY OF IT I walked in loamy Wessex lanes, afar From rail-track and from highway, and I heard In field and farmstead many an ancient word Of local lineage like “Thu bist,” “Er war,” “Ich woll,” “Er sholl,” and by-talk similar, Nigh as they speak who in this month's moon gird At England's very loins, thereunto spurred By gangs whose glory threats and slaughters are. Then seemed a Heart crying: “Whosoever they be At root and bottom of this, who flung this flame Between kin folk kin tongued even as are we, “Sinister, ugly, lurid, be their fame; May their familiars grow to shun their name, And their brood perish everlastingly.” April 1915. IN TIME OF WARS AND TUMULTS “Would that I'd not drawn breath here!” some one said, “To stalk upon this stage of evil deeds, Where purposelessly month by month proceeds A play so sorely shaped and blood-bespread.” Yet had his spark not quickened, but lain dead To the gross spectacles of this our day, And never put on the proffered cloak of clay, He had but known not things now manifested; Life would have swirled the same. Morns would have dawned On the uprooting by the night-gun's stroke Of what the yester noonshine brought to flower; Brown martial brows in dying throes have wanned Despite his absence; hearts no fewer been broke By Empery's insatiate lust of power. 1915. IN TIME OF “THE BREAKING OF NATIONS” Jer. li. 20. I Only a man harrowing clods In a slow silent walk With an old horse that stumbles and nods Half asleep as they stalk. II Only thin smoke without flame From the heaps of couch-grass; Yet this will go onward the same Though Dynasties pass. III Yonder a maid and her wight Come whispering by: War's annals will cloud into night Ere their story die. 1915. CRY OF THE HOMELESS AFTER THE PRUSSIAN INVASION OF BELGIUM “Instigator of the ruin— Whichsoever thou mayst be Of the masterful of Europe That contrived our misery— Hear the wormwood-worded greeting From each city, shore, and lea Of thy victims: “Conqueror, all hail to thee!” “Yea: ‘All hail!’ we grimly shout thee That wast author, fount, and head Of these wounds, whoever proven When our times are throughly read ‘May thy loved be slighted, blighted, And forsaken,’ be it said By thy victims, ‘And thy children beg their bread!’ “Nay: a richer malediction!— Rather let this thing befall In time's hurling and unfurling On the night when comes thy call; That compassion dew thy pillow And bedrench thy senses all For thy victims, Till death dark thee with his pall.” August 1915. BEFORE MARCHING AND AFTER (In Memoriam F. W. G.) Orion swung southward aslant Where the starved Egdon pine-trees had thinned, The Pleiads aloft seemed to pant With the heather that twitched in the wind; But he looked on indifferent to sights such as these, Unswayed by love, friendship, home joy or home sorrow, And wondered to what he would march on the morrow. The crazed household-clock with its whirr Rang midnight within as he stood, He heard the low sighing of her Who had striven from his birth for his good; But he still only asked the spring starlight, the breeze, What great thing or small thing his history would borrow From that Game with Death he would play on the morrow. When the heath wore the robe of late summer, And the fuchsia-bells, hot in the sun, Hung red by the door, a quick comer Brought tidings that marching was done For him who had joined in that game over-seas Where Death stood to win, though his name was to borrow A brightness therefrom not to fade on the morrow. September 1915. “OFTEN WHEN WARRING” Often when warring for he wist not what, An enemy-soldier, passing by one weak, Has tendered water, wiped the burning cheek, And cooled the lips so black and clammed and hot; Then gone his way, and maybe quite forgot The deed of grace amid the roar and reek; Yet larger vision than loud arms bespeak He there has reached, although he has known it not. For natural mindsight, triumphing in the act Over the throes of artificial rage, Has thuswise muffled victory's peal of pride, Rended to ribands policy's specious page That deals but with evasion, code, and pact, And war's apology wholly stultified. 1915. THEN AND NOW When battles were fought With a chivalrous sense of Should and Ought, In spirit men said, “End we quick or dead, Honour is some reward! Let us fight fair—for our own best or worst; So, Gentlemen of the Guard, Fire first!” In the open they stood, Man to man in his knightlihood: They would not deign To profit by a stain On the honourable rules, Knowing that practise perfidy no man durst Who in the heroic schools Was nurst. But now, behold, what Is warfare wherein honour is not! Rama laments Its dead innocents: Herod breathes: “Sly slaughter Shall rule! Let us, by modes once called accurst, Overhead, under water, Stab first.” 1915. A CALL TO NATIONAL SERVICE Up and be doing, all who have a hand To lift, a back to bend. It must not be In times like these that vaguely linger we To air our vaunts and hopes; and leave our land Untended as a wild of weeds and sand. —Say, then, “I come!” and go, O women and men Of palace, ploughshare, easel, counter, pen; That scareless, scathless, England still may stand. Would years but let me stir as once I stirred At many a dawn to take the forward track, And with a stride plunged on to enterprize, I now would speed like yester wind that whirred Through yielding pines; and serve with never a slack, So loud for promptness all around outcries! March 1917. THE DEAD AND THE LIVING ONE The dead woman lay in her first night's grave, And twilight fell from the clouds' concave, And those she had asked to forgive forgave. The woman passing came to a pause By the heaped white shapes of wreath and cross, And looked upon where the other was. And as she mused there thus spoke she: “Never your countenance did I see, But you've been a good good friend to me!” Rose a plaintive voice from the sod below: “O woman whose accents I do not know, What is it that makes you approve me so?” “O dead one, ere my soldier went, I heard him saying, with warm intent, To his friend, when won by your blandishment: “‘I would change for that lass here and now! And if I return I may break my vow To my present Love, and contrive somehow “‘To call my own this new-found pearl, Whose eyes have the light, whose lips the curl I always have looked for in a girl!’ “—And this is why that by ceasing to be— Though never your countenance did I see— You prove you a good good friend to me; “And I pray each hour for your soul's repose In gratitude for your joining those No lover will clasp when his campaigns close.” Away she turned, when arose to her eye A martial phantom of gory dye, That said, with a thin and far-off sigh: “O sweetheart, neither shall I clasp you! For the foe this day has pierced me through, And sent me to where she is. Adieu!— “And forget not when the night-wind's whine Calls over this turf where her limbs recline, That it travels on to lament by mine.” There was a cry by the white-flowered mound, There was a laugh from underground, There was a deeper gloom around. 1915. A NEW YEAR'S EVE IN WAR TIME I Phantasmal fears, And the flap of the flame, And the throb of the clock, And a loosened slate, And the blind night's drone, Which tiredly the spectral pines intone: II And the blood in my ears Strumming always the same, And the gable-cock With its fitful grate, And myself, alone. III The twelfth hour nears Hand-hid, as in shame; I undo the lock, And listen, and wait For the Young Unknown. IV In the dark there careers— As if Death astride came To numb all with his knock— A horse at mad rate Over rut and stone. V No figure appears, No call of my name, No sound but “Tic-toc” Without check. Past the gate It clatters—is gone. VI What rider it bears There is none to proclaim; And the Old Year has struck, And, scarce animate. The New makes moan. VII Maybe that “More Tears!— More Famine and Flame— More Severance and Shock!” Is the order from Fate That the Rider speeds on To pale Europe; and tiredly the pines intone. 1915–1916 “I MET A MAN” I met a man when night was nigh, Who said, with shining face and eye Like Moses' after Sinai:— “I have seen the Moulder of Monarchies, Realms, peoples, plains and hills, Sitting upon the sunlit seas!— And, as He sat, soliloquies Fell from Him like an antiphonic breeze That pricks the waves to thrills. “Meseemed that of the maimed and dead Mown down upon the globe,— Their plenteous blooms of promise shed Ere fruiting-time—His words were said, Sitting against the western web of red Wrapt in His crimson robe. “And I could catch them now and then: —‘Why let these gambling clans Of human Cockers, pit liege men From mart and city, dale and glen, In death-mains, but to swell and swell again Their swollen All-Empery plans, “‘When a mere nod (if my malign Compeer but passive keep) Would mend that old mistake of mine I made with Saul, and ever consign All Lords of War whose sanctuaries enshrine Liberticide, to sleep? “‘With violence the lands are spread Even as in Israel's day, And it repenteth me I bred Chartered armipotents lust-led To feuds . . . . Yea, grieves my heart, as then I said, To see their evil way!’ —“The utterance grew, and flapped like flame, And further speech I feared; But no Celestial tongued acclaim, And no huzzas from earthlings came, And the heavens mutely masked as 'twere in shame Till daylight disappeared.” Thus ended he as night rode high— The man of shining face and eye, Like Moses' after Sinai. 1916. “I LOOKED UP FROM MY WRITING” I looked up from my writing, And gave a start to see, As if rapt in my inditing, The moon's full gaze on me. Her meditative misty head Was spectral in its air, And I involuntarily said, “What are you doing there?” “Oh, I've been scanning pond and hole And waterway hereabout For the body of one with a sunken soul Who has put his life-light out. “Did you hear his frenzied tattle? It was sorrow for his son Who is slain in brutish battle, Though he has injured none. “And now I am curious to look Into the blinkered mind Of one who wants to write a book In a world of such a kind.” Her temper overwrought me, And I edged to shun her view, For I felt assured she thought me One who should drown him too. FINALE THE COMING OF THE END How it came to an end! The meeting afar from the crowd, And the love-looks and laughters unpenned. The parting when much was avowed, How it came to an end! It came to an end; Yes, the outgazing over the stream, With the sun on each serpentine bend. Or, later, the luring moon-gleam; It came to an end. It came to an end, The housebuilding, furnishing, planting, As if there were ages to spend In welcoming, feasting, and jaunting; It came to an end. It came to an end, That journey of one day a week: (“It always goes on,” said a friend, “Just the same in bright weathers or bleak;”) But it came to an end. “How will come to an end This orbit so smoothly begun, Unless some convulsion attend?” I often said. “What will be done When it comes to an end?” Well, it came to an end Quite silently—stopped without jerk; Better close no prevision could lend; Working out as One planned it should work Ere it came to an end. AFTERWARDS When the Present has latched its postern behind my tremulous stay, And the May month flaps its glad green leaves like wings, Delicate-filmed as new-spun silk, will the neighbours say, “He was a man who used to notice such things”? If it be in the dusk when, like an eyelid's soundless blink, The dewfall-hawk comes crossing the shades to alight Upon the wind-warped upland thorn, a gazer may think, “To him this must have been a familiar sight.” If I pass during some nocturnal blackness, mothy and warm, When the hedgehog travels furtively over the lawn, One may say, “He strove that such innocent creatures should come to no harm, But he could do little for them; and now he is gone.” If, when hearing that I have been stilled at last, they stand at the door, Watching the full-starred heavens that winter sees, Will this thought rise on those who will meet my face no more, “He was one who had an eye for such mysteries”? And will any say when my bell of quittance is heard in the gloom And a crossing breeze cuts a pause in its outrollings, Till they rise again, as they were a new bell's boom, “He hears it not now, but used to notice such things”?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LATE LYRICS AND EARLIER WEATHERS I This is the weather the cuckoo likes, And so do I; When showers betumble the chestnut spikes, And nestlings fly: And the little brown nightingale bills his best, And they sit outside at “The Travellers' Rest,” And maids come forth sprig-muslin drest, And citizens dream of the south and west, And so do I. II This is the weather the shepherd shuns, And so do I; When beeches drip in browns and duns, And thresh, and ply; And hill-hid tides throb, throe on throe, And meadow rivulets overflow, And drops on gate-bars hang in a row, And rooks in families homeward go, And so do I. THE MAID OF KEINTON MANDEVILLE (A TRIBUTE TO SIR H. BISHOP) I hear that maiden still Of Keinton Mandeville Singing, in flights that played As wind-wafts through us all, Till they made our mood a thrall To their aery rise and fall, “Should he upbraid!” Rose-necked, in sky-gray gown, From a stage in Stower Town Did she sing, and singing smile As she blent that dexterous voice With the ditty of her choice, And banished our annoys Thereawhile. One with such song had power To wing the heaviest hour Of him who housed with her. Who did I never knew When her spoused estate ondrew, And her warble flung its woo In his ear. Ah, she's a beldame now, Time-trenched on cheek and brow, Whom I once heard as a maid From Keinton Mandeville Of matchless scope and skill Sing, with smile and swell and trill. “Should he upbraid!” 1915 or 1916. SUMMER SCHEMES When friendly summer calls again, Calls again Her little fifers to these hills, We'll go—we two—to that arched fane Of leafage where they prime their bills Before they start to flood the plain With quavers, minims, shakes, and trills. “—We'll go,” I sing; but who shall say What may not chance before that day! And we shall see the waters spring, Waters spring From chinks the scrubby copses crown; And we shall trace their oncreeping To where the cascade tumbles down And sends the bobbing growths aswing, And ferns not quite but almost drown. “—We shall,” I say; but who may sing Of what another moon will bring! EPEISODIA I Past the hills that peep Where the leaze is smiling, On and on beguiling Crisply-cropping sheep; Under boughs of brushwood Linking tree and tree In a shade of lushwood, There caressed we! II Hemmed by city walls That outshut the sunlight, In a foggy dun light, Where the footstep falls With a pit-pat wearisome In its cadency On the flagstones drearisome There pressed we! III Where in wild-winged crowds Blown birds show their whiteness Up against the lightness Of the clammy clouds; By the random river Pushing to the sea, Under bents that quiver There shall rest we. FAINTHEART IN A RAILWAY TRAIN At nine in the morning there passed a church, At ten there passed me by the sea, At twelve a town of smoke and smirch, At two a forest of oak and birch, And then, on a platform, she: A radiant stranger, who saw not me. I said, “Get out to her do I dare?” But I kept my seat in my search for a plea, And the wheels moved on. O could it but be That I had alighted there! AT MOONRISE AND ONWARDS I thought you a fire On Heath-Plantation Hill, Dealing out mischief the most dire To the chattels of men of hire There in their vill. But by and by You turned a yellow-green, Like a large glow-worm in the sky; And then I could descry Your mood and mien. How well I know Your furtive feminine shape! As if reluctantly you show You nude of cloud, and but by favour throw Aside its drape . . . . —How many a year Have you kept pace with me, Wan Woman of the waste up there Behind a hedge, or the bare Bough of a tree! No novelty are you, O Lady of all my time, Veering unbid into my view Whether I near Death's mew, Or Life's top cyme! THE GARDEN SEAT Its former green is blue and thin, And its once firm legs sink in and in; Soon it will break down unaware, Soon it will break down unaware. At night when reddest flowers are black Those who once sat thereon come back; Quite a row of them sitting there, Quite a row of them sitting there. With them the seat does not break down, Nor winter freeze them, nor floods drown, For they are as light as upper air, They are as light as upper air! BARTHÉLÉMON AT VAUXHALL François Hippolite Barthélémon, first-fiddler at Vauxhall Gardens, compose what was probably the most popular morning hymn-tune ever written. It was formerly sung, full-voiced, every Sunday in most churches, to Bishop Ken's words, but is now seldom heard. He said: “Awake my soul, and with the sun,” . . . And paused upon the bridge, his eyes due east, Where was emerging like a full-robed priest The irradiate globe that vouched the dark as done. It lit his face—the weary face of one Who in the adjacent gardens charged his string, Nightly, with many a tuneful tender thing, Till stars were weak, and dancing hours outrun. And then were threads of matin music spun In trial tones as he pursued his way: “This is a morn,” he murmured, “well begun: This strain to Ken will count when I am clay!” And count it did; till, caught by echoing lyres, It spread to galleried naves and mighty quires. “I SOMETIMES THINK” (FOR F. E. H.) I sometimes think as here I sit Of things I have done, Which seemed in doing not unfit To face the sun: Yet never a soul has paused a whit On such—not one. There was that eager strenuous press To sow good seed; There was that saving from distress In the nick of need; There were those words in the wilderness: Who cared to heed? Yet can this be full true, or no? For one did care, And, spiriting into my house, to, fro, Like wind on the stair, Cares still, heeds all, and will, even though I may despair. JEZREEL ON ITS SEIZURE BY THE ENGLISH UNDER ALLENBY, SEPTEMBER 1918 Did they catch as it were in a Vision at shut of the day— When their cavalry smote through the ancient Esdraelon Plain, And they crossed where the Tishbite stood forth in his enemy's way— His gaunt mournful Shade as he bade the King haste off amain? On war-men at this end of time—even on Englishmen's eyes— Who slay with their arms of new might in that long-ago place, Flashed he who drove furiously? . . . Ah, did the phantom arise Of that queen, of that proud Tyrian woman who painted her face? Faintly marked they the words “Throw her down!” from the Night eerily, Spectre-spots of the blood of her body on some rotten wall? And the thin note of pity that came: “A King's daughter is she,” As they passed where she trodden was once by the chargers' footfall? Could such be the hauntings of men of to-day, at the cease Of pursuit, at the dusk-hour, ere slumber their senses could seal? Enghosted seers, kings—one on horseback who asked “Is it peace?” . . . Yea, strange things and spectral may men have beheld in Jezreel! September 24, 1918. A JOG-TROT PAIR Who were the twain that trod this track So many times together Hither and back, In spells of certain and uncertain weather? Commonplace in conduct they Who wandered to and fro here Day by day: Two that few dwellers troubled themselves to know here. The very gravel-path was prim That daily they would follow: Borders trim: Never a wayward sprout, or hump, or hollow. Trite usages in tamest style Had tended to their plighting. “It's just worth while, Perhaps,” they had said. “And saves much sad good-nighting.” And petty seemed the happenings That ministered to their joyance: Simple things, Onerous to satiate souls, increased their buoyance Who could those common people be, Of days the plainest, barest? They were we; Yes; happier than the cleverest, smartest, rarest. “THE CURTAINS NOW ARE DRAWN” (SONG) I The curtains now are drawn, And the spindrift strikes the glass, Blown up the jaggèd pass By the surly salt sou'-west, And the sneering glare is gone Behind the yonder crest, While she sings to me: “O the dream that thou art my Love, be it thine, And the dream that I am thy Love, be it mine, And death may come, but loving is divine.” II I stand here in the rain, With its smite upon her stone, And the grasses that have grown Over women, children, men, And their texts that “Life is vain;” But I hear the notes as when Once she sang to me: “O the dream that thou art my Love, be it thine, And the dream that I am thy Love, be it mine, And death may come, but loving is divine.” 1913. “ACCORDING TO THE MIGHTY WORKING” I When moiling seems at cease In the vague void of night-time, And heaven's wide roomage stormless Between the dusk and light-time, And fear at last is formless, We call the allurement Peace. II Peace, this hid riot, Change, This revel of quick-cued mumming, This never truly being, This evermore becoming, This spinner's wheel onfleeing Outside perception's range. 1917. “I WAS NOT HE” (SONG) I was not he—the man Who used to pilgrim to your gate, At whose smart step you grew elate, And rosed, as maidens can, For a brief span. It was not I who sang Beside the keys you touched so true With note-bent eyes, as if with you It counted not whence sprang The voice that rang . . . . Yet though my destiny It was to miss your early sweet, You still, when turned to you my feet, Had sweet enough to be A prize for me! THE WEST-OF-WESSEX GIRL A very West-of-Wessex girl, As blithe as blithe could be, Was once well-known to me, And she would laud her native town, And hope and hope that we Might sometime study up and down Its charms in company. But never I squired my Wessex girl In jaunts to Hoe or street When hearts were high in beat, Nor saw her in the marbled ways Where market-people meet That in her bounding early days Were friendly with her feet. Yet now my West-of-Wessex girl, When midnight hammers slow From Andrew's, blow by blow, As phantom draws me by the hand To the place—Plymouth Hoe— Where side by side in life, as planned, We never were to go! Begun in Plymouth, March 1913. WELCOME HOME Back to my native place Bent upon returning, Bosom all day burning To be where my race Well were known, 'twas keen with me There to dwell in amity. Folk had sought their beds, But I hailed: to view me Under the moon, out to me Several pushed their heads, And to each I told my name, Plans, and that therefrom I came. “Did you? . . . Ah, 'tis true,” Said they, “back a long time, Here had spent his young time, Some such man as you . . . Good-night.” The casement closed again, And I was left in the frosty lane. GOING AND STAYING I The moving sun-shapes on the spray, The sparkles where the brook was flowing, Pink faces, plightings, moonlit May, These were the things we wished would stay; But they were going. II Seasons of blankness as of snow, The silent bleed of a world decaying, The moan of multitudes in woe, These were the things we wished would go; But they were staying. III Then we looked closelier at Time, And saw his ghostly arms revolving To sweep off woeful things with prime, Things sinister with things sublime Alike dissolving. READ BY MOONLIGHT I paused to read a letter of hers By the moon's cold shine, Eyeing it in the tenderest way, And edging it up to catch each ray Upon her light-penned line. I did not know what years would flow Of her life's span and mine Ere I read another letter of hers By the moon's cold shine! I chance now on the last of hers, By the moon's cold shine; It is the one remaining page Out of the many shallow and sage Whereto she set her sign. Who could foresee there were to be Such missives of pain and pine Ere I should read this last of hers By the moon's cold shine! AT A HOUSE IN HAMPSTEAD SOMETIME THE DWELLING OF JOHN KEATS O poet, come you haunting here Where streets have stolen up all around, And never a nightingale pours one Full-throated sound? Drawn from your drowse by the Seven famed Hills, Thought you to find all just the same Here shining, as in hours of old, If you but came? What will you do in your surprise At seeing that changes wrought in Rome Are wrought yet more on the misty slope One time your home? Will you wake wind-wafts on these stairs? Swing the doors open noisily? Show as an umbraged ghost beside Your ancient tree? Or will you, softening, the while You further and yet further look, Learn that a laggard few would fain Preserve your nook? . . . —Where the Piazza steps incline, And catch late light at eventide, I once stood, in that Rome, and thought, “'Twas here he died.” I drew to a violet-sprinkled spot, Where day and night a pyramid keeps Uplifted its white hand, and said, “'Tis there he sleeps.” Pleasanter now it is to hold That here, where sang he, more of him Remains than where he, tuneless, cold, Passed to the dim. July 1920. A WOMAN'S FANCY “Ah, Madam; you've indeed come back here? 'Twas sad—your husband's so swift death, And you away! You shouldn't have left him: It hastened his last breath.” “Dame, I am not the lady you think me; I know not her, nor know her name; I've come to lodge here—a friendless woman; My health my only aim.” She came; she lodged. Wherever she rambled They held her as no other than The lady named; and told how her husband Had died a forsaken man. So often did they call her thuswise Mistakenly, by that man's name, So much did they declare about him, That his past form and fame Grew on her, till she pitied his sorrow As if she truly had been the cause— Yea, his deserter; and came to wonder What mould of man he was. “Tell me my history!” would exclaim she; “Our history,” she said mournfully. “But you know, surely, Ma'am?” they would answer, Much in perplexity. Curious, she crept to his grave one evening, And a second time in the dusk of the morrow; Then a third time, with crescent emotion Like a bereaved wife's sorrow. No gravestone rose by the rounded hillock; —“I marvel why this is?” she said. —“He had no kindred, Ma'am, but you near.” —She set a stone at his head. She learnt to dream of him, and told them: “In slumber often uprises he, And says: ‘I am joyed that, after all, Dear, You've not deserted me!’” At length died too this kinless woman, As he had died she had grown to crave; And at her dying she besought them To bury her in his grave. Such said, she had paused; until she added: “Call me by his name on the stone, As I were, first to last, his dearest, Not she who left him lone!” And this they did. And so it became there That, by the strength of a tender whim, The stranger was she who bore his name there, Not she who wedded him. HER SONG I sang that song on Sunday, To witch an idle while, I sang that song on Monday, As fittest to beguile: I sang it as the year outwore, And the new slid in; I thought not what might shape before Another would begin. I sang that song in summer, All unforeknowingly, To him as a new-comer From regions strange to me: I sang it when in afteryears The shades stretched out, And paths were faint; and flocking fears Brought cup-eyed care and doubt. Sings he that song on Sundays In some dim land afar, On Saturdays, or Mondays, As when the evening star Glimpsed in upon his bending face, And my hanging hair, And time untouched me with a trace Of soul-smart or despair? A WET AUGUST Nine drops of water bead the jessamine, And nine-and-ninety smear the stones and tiles: —'Twas not so in that August—full-rayed, fine— When we lived out-of-doors, sang songs, strode miles. Or was there then no noted radiancy Of summer? Were dun clouds, a dribbling bough, Gilt over by the light I bore in me, And was the waste world just the same as now? It can have been so: yea, that threatenings Of coming down-drip on the sunless gray, By the then golden chances seen in things Were wrought more bright than brightest skies to-day. 1920. THE DISSEMBLERS “It was not you I came to please, Only myself,” flipped she; “I like this spot of phantasies, And thought you far from me.” But O, he was the secret spell That led her to the lea! “It was not she who shaped my ways, Or works, or thoughts,” he said. “I scarcely marked her living days, Or missed her much when dead.” But O, his joyance knew its knell When daisies hid her head! TO A LADY PLAYING AND SINGING IN THE MORNING Joyful lady, sing! And I will lurk here listening, Though nought be done, and nought begun, And work-hours swift are scurrying. Sing, O lady, still! Aye, I will wait each note you trill, Though duties due that press to do This whole day long I unfulfil. “—It is an evening tune; One not designed to waste the noon,” You say. I know: time bids me go— For daytide passes too, too soon! But let indulgence be, This once, to my rash ecstasy: When sounds nowhere that carolled air My idled morn may comfort me! “A MAN WAS DRAWING NEAR TO ME” On that gray night of mournful drone, Apart from aught to hear, to see, I dreamt not that from shires unknown In gloom, alone, By Halworthy, A man was drawing near to me. I'd no concern at anything, No sense of coming pull-heart play; Yet, under the silent outspreading Of even's wing Where Otterham lay, A man was riding up my way. I thought of nobody—not of one, But only of trifles—legends, ghosts— Though, on the moorland dim and dun That travellers shun About these coasts, The man had passed Tresparret Posts. There was no light at all inland, Only the seaward pharos-fire, Nothing to let me understand That hard at hand By Hennett Byre The man was getting nigh and nigher. There was a rumble at the door, A draught disturbed the drapery, And but a minute passed before, With gaze that bore My destiny, The man revealed himself to me. THE STRANGE HOUSE (MAX GATE, A.D. 2000) “I hear the piano playing— Just as a ghost might play.” “—O, but what are you saying? There's no piano to-day; Their old one was sold and broken: Years past it went amiss.” “—I heard it, or shouldn't have spoken: A strange house, this! “I catch some undertone here, From some one out of sight.” “—Impossible; we are alone here, And shall be through the night.” “—The parlour-door—what stirred it?” “—No one: no soul's in range.” “—But, anyhow, I heard it, And it seems strange! “Seek my own room I cannot— A figure is on the stair!” “—What figure? Nay, I scan not Any one lingering there. A bough outside is waving, And that's its shade by the moon.” “—Well, all is strange! I am craving Strength to leave soon.” “—Ah, maybe you've some vision Of showings beyond our sphere; Some sight, sense, intuition Of what once happened here? The house is old; they've hinted It once held two love-thralls, And they may have imprinted Their dreams on its walls? “They were—I think 'twas told me— Queer in their works and ways; The teller would often hold me With weird tales of those days, Some folk can not abide here, But we—we do not care Who loved, laughed, wept, or died here, Knew joy, or despair.” “AS 'TWERE TO-NIGHT” (SONG) As 'twere to-night, in the brief space Of a far eventime, My spirit rang achime At vision of a girl of grace; As 'twere to-night, in the brief space Of a far eventime. As 'twere at noontide of to-morrow I airily walked and talked, And wondered as I walked What it could mean, this soar from sorrow; As 'twere at noontide of to-morrow I airily walked and talked. As 'twere at waning of this week Broke a new life on me; Trancings of bliss to be In some dim dear land soon to seek; As 'twere at waning of this week Broke a new life on me! THE CONTRETEMPS A forward rush by the lamp in the gloom, And we clasped, and almost kissed; But she was not the woman whom I had promised to meet in the thawing brume On that harbour-bridge; nor was I he of her tryst. So loosening from me swift she said: “O why, why feign to be The one I had meant!—to whom I have sped To fly with, being so sorrily wed!” —'Twas thus and thus that she upbraided me. My assignation had struck upon Some others' like it, I found. And her lover rose on the night anon; And then her husband entered on The lamplit, snowflaked, sloppiness around. “Take her and welcome, man!” he cried: “I wash my hands of her. I'll find me twice as good a bride!” —All this to me, whom he had eyed, Plainly, as his wife's planned deliverer. And next the lover: “Little I knew, Madam, you had a third! Kissing here in my very view!” —Husband and lover then withdrew. I let them; and I told them not they erred. Why not? Well, there faced she and I— Two strangers who'd kissed, or near, Chancewise. To see stand weeping by A woman once embraced, will try The tension of a man the most austere. So it began; and I was young, She pretty, by the lamp, As flakes came waltzing down among The waves of her clinging hair, that hung Heavily on her temples, dark and damp. And there alone still stood we two; She one cast off for me, Or so it seemed: while night ondrew, Forcing a parley what should do We twain hearts caught in one catastrophe In stranded souls a common strait Wakes latencies unknown, Whose impulse may precipitate A life-long leap. The hour was late, And there was the Jersey boat with its funnel agroan. “Is wary walking worth much pother?” It grunted, as still it stayed. “One pairing is as good as another Where all is venture! Take each other, And scrap the oaths that you have aforetime made.” —Of the four involved there walks but one On earth at this late day. And what of the chapter so begun? In that odd complex what was done? Well; happiness comes in full to none: Let peace lie on lulled lips: I will not say. Weymouth. A GENTLEMAN'S EPITAPH ON HIMSELF AND A LADY, WHO WERE BURIED TOGETHER I dwelt in the shade of a city, She far by the sea, With folk perhaps good, gracious, witty; But never with me. Her form on the ballroom's smooth flooring I never once met, To guide her with accents adoring Through Weippert's “First Set.” Quadrilles danced early in the nineteenth century. I spent my life's seasons with pale ones In Vanity Fair, And she enjoyed hers among hale ones In salt-smelling air. Maybe she had eyes of deep colour, Maybe they were blue, Maybe as she aged they got duller; That never I knew. She may have had lips like the coral, But I never kissed them, Saw pouting, nor curling in quarrel, Nor sought for, nor missed them. Not a word passed of love all our lifetime, Between us, nor thrill; We'd never a husband-and-wife time, For good or for ill. Yet as one dust, through bleak days and vernal Lie I and lies she, This never-known lady, eternal Companion to me! THE OLD GOWN (SONG) I have seen her in gowns the brightest, Of azure, green, and red, And in the simplest, whitest, Muslined from heel to head; I have watched her walking, riding, Shade-flecked by a leafy tree, Or in fixed thought abiding By the foam-fingered sea. In woodlands I have known her, When boughs were mourning loud, In the rain-reek she has shown her Wild-haired and watery-browed. And once or twice she has cast me As she pomped along the street Court-clad, ere quite she had passed me, A glance from her chariot-seat. But in my memoried passion For evermore stand she In the gown of fading fashion She wore that night when we, Doomed long to part, assembled In the snug small room; yea, when She sang with lips that trembled, “Shall I see his face again?” A NIGHT IN NOVEMBER I marked when the weather changed, And the panes began to quake, And the winds rose up and ranged, That night, lying half-awake. Dead leaves blew into my room, And alighted upon my bed, And a tree declared to the gloom Its sorrow that they were shed. One leaf of them touched my hand, And I thought that it was you There stood as you used to stand, And saying at last you knew! (?) 1913. A DUETTIST TO HER PIANOFORTE SONG OF SILENCE (E. L. H.—H. C. H.) Since every sound moves memories, How can I play you Just as I might if you raised no scene, By your ivory rows, of a form between My vision and your time-worn sheen, As when each day you Answered our fingers with ecstasy? So it's hushed, hushed, hushed, you are for me! And as I am doomed to counterchord Her notes no more In those old things I used to know, In a fashion, when we practised so, “Good-night!—Good-bye!” to your pleated show Of silk, now hoar, Each nodding hammer, and pedal and key, For dead, dead, dead, you are to me! I fain would second her, strike to her stroke, As when she was by, Aye, even from the ancient clamorous “Fall Of Paris,” or “Battle of Prague” withal, To the “Roving Minstrels,” or “Elfin Call” Sung soft as a sigh: But upping ghosts press achefully, And mute, mute, mute, you are for me! Should I fling your polyphones, plaints, and quavers Afresh on the air, Too quick would the small white shapes be here Of the fellow twain of hands so dear; And a black-tressed profile, and pale smooth ear; —Then how shall I bear Such heavily-haunted harmony? Nay: hushed, hushed, hushed, you are for me! “WHERE THREE ROADS JOINED” Where three roads joined it was green and fair, And over a gate was the sun-glazed sea, And life laughed sweet when I halted there; Yet there I never again would be. I am sure those branchways are brooding now, With a wistful blankness upon their face, While the few mute passengers notice how Spectre-beridden is the place; Which nightly sighs like a laden soul, And grieves that a pair, in bliss for a spell Not far from thence, should have let it roll Away from them down a plumbless well While the phasm of him who fared starts up, And of her who was waiting him sobs from near As they haunt there and drink the wormwood cup They filled for themselves when their sky was clear. Yes, I see those roads—now rutted and bare, While over the gate is no sun-glazed sea; And though life laughed when I halted there, It is where I never again would be. “AND THERE WAS A GREAT CALM” (ON THE SIGNING OF THE ARMISTICE, NOV. 11, 1918) I There had been years of Passion—scorching, cold, And much Despair, and Anger heaving high, Care whitely watching, Sorrows manifold, Among the young, among the weak and old, And the pensive Spirit of Pity whispered, “Why?” II Men had not paused to answer. Foes distraught Pierced the thinned peoples in a brute-like blindness, Philosophies that sages long had taught, And Selflessness, were as an unknown thought, And “Hell!” and “Shell!” were yapped at Lovingkindness. III The feeble folk at home had grown full-used To “dug-outs,” “snipers,” “Huns,” from the war-adept In the mornings heard, and at evetides perused; To day-dreamt men in millions, when they mused— To nightmare-men in millions when they slept. IV Waking to wish existence timeless, null, Sirius they watched above where armies fell; He seemed to check his flapping when, in the lull Of night a boom came thencewise, like the dull Plunge of a stone dropped into some deep well. V So, when old hopes that earth was bettering slowly Were dead and damned, there sounded “War is done!” One morrow. Said the bereft, and meek, and lowly, “Will men some day be given to grace? yea, wholly, And in good sooth, as our dreams used to run?” VI Breathless they paused. Out there men raised their glance To where had stood those poplars lank and lopped, As they had raised it through the four years' dance Of Death in the now familiar flats of France; And murmured, “Strange, this! How? All firing stopped?” VII Aye; all was hushed. The about-to-fire fired not, The aimed-at moved away in trance-lipped song. One checkless regiment slung a clinching shot And turned. The Spirit of Irony smirked out, “What? Spoil peradventures woven of Rage and Wrong?” VIII Thenceforth no flying fires inflamed the gray, No hurtlings shook the dewdrop from the thorn, No moan perplexed the mute bird on the spray; Worn horses mused: “We are not whipped to-day”; No weft-winged engines blurred the moon's thin horn. IX Calm fell. From Heaven distilled a clemency; There was peace on earth, and silence in the sky; Some could, some could not, shake off misery: The Sinister Spirit sneered: “It had to be!” And again the Spirit of Pity whispered, “Why?” HAUNTING FINGERS A PHANTASY IN A MUSEUM OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS “Are you awake, Comrades, this silent night? Well 'twere if all of our glossy gluey make Lay in the damp without, and fell to fragments quite!” “O viol, my friend, I watch, though Phosphor nears, And I fain would drowse away to its utter end This dumb dark stowage after our loud melodious years!” And they felt past handlers clutch them, Though none was in the room, Old players' dead fingers touch them, Shrunk in the tomb. “'Cello, good mate, You speak my mind as yours: Doomed to this voiceless, crippled, corpselike state, Who, dear to famed Amphion, trapped here, long endures?” “Once I could thrill The populace through and through, Wake them to passioned pulsings past their will.” . . . (A contra-basso spake so, and the rest sighed anew.) And they felt old muscles travel Over their tense contours, And with long skill unravel Cunningest scores. “The tender pat Of her aery finger-tips Upon me daily—I rejoiced thereat!” (Thuswise a harpsicord, as 'twere from dampered lips.) “My keys' white shine, Now sallow, met a hand Even whiter. . . . Tones of hers fell forth with mine In sowings of sound so sweet no lover could withstand!” And its clavier was filmed with fingers Like tapering flames—wan, cold— Or the nebulous light that lingers In charnel mould. “Gayer than most Was I,” reverbed a drum; “The regiments, marchings, throngs, hurrahs! What a host I stirred—even when crape mufflings gagged me well-nigh dumb! Trilled an aged viol: “Much tune have I set free To spur the dance, since my first timid trial Where I had birth—far hence, in sun-swept Italy!” And he feels apt touches on him From those that pressed him then; Who seem with their glance to con him, Saying, “Not again!” “A holy calm,” Mourned a shawm's voice subdued, “Steeped my Cecilian rhythms when hymn and psalm Poured from devout souls met in Sabbath sanctitude.” “I faced the sock Nightly,” twanged a sick lyre, “Over ranked lights! O charm of life in mock, O scenes that fed love, hope, wit, rapture, mirth, desire!” Thus they, till each past player Stroked thinner and more thin, And the morning sky grew grayer And day crawled in. THE WOMAN I MET A stranger, I threaded sunken-hearted A lamp-lit crowd; And anon there passed me a soul departed, Who mutely bowed. In my far-off youthful years I had met her, Full-pulsed; but now, no more life's debtor, Onward she slid In a shroud that furs half-hid. “Why do you trouble me, dead woman, Trouble me; You whom I knew when warm and human? —How it be That you quitted earth and are yet upon it Is, to any who ponder on it, Past being read!” “Still, it is so,” she said. “These were my haunts in my olden sprightly Hours of breath; Here I went tempting frail youth nightly To their death; But you deemed me chaste—me, a tinselled sinner! How thought you one with pureness in her Could pace this street Eyeing some man to greet? “Well; your very simplicity made me love you Mid such town dross, Till I set not Heaven itself above you, Who grew my Cross; For you'd only nod, despite how I sighed for you; So you tortured me, who fain would have died for you! —What I suffered then Would have paid for the sins of ten! “Thus went the days. I feared you despised me To fling me a nod Each time, no more: till love chastised me As with a rod That a fresh bland boy of no assurance Should fire me with passion beyond endurance, While others all I hated, and loathed their call. “I said: ‘It is his mother's spirit Hovering around To shield him, maybe!’ I used to fear it, As still I found My beauty left no least impression, And remnants of pride withheld confession Of my true trade By speaking; so I delayed. “I said: ‘Perhaps with a costly flower He'll be beguiled.’ I held it, in passing you one late hour, To your face: you smiled, Keeping step with the throng; though you did not see there A single one that rivalled me there! . . . Well: it's all past. I died in the Lock at last.” So walked the dead and I together The quick among, Elbowing our kind of every feather Slowly and long; Yea, long and slowly. That a phantom should stalk there With me seemed nothing strange, and talk there That winter night By flaming jets of light. She showed me Juans who feared their call-time, Guessing their lot; She showed me her sort that cursed their fall-time, And that did not. Till suddenly murmured she: “Now, tell me, Why asked you never, ere death befell me, To have my love, Much as I dreamt thereof?” I could not answer. And she, well weeting All in my heart, Said: “God your guardian kept our fleeting Forms apart!” Sighing and drawing her furs around her Over the shroud that tightly bound her, With wafts as from clay She turned and thinned away. London, 1918. “IF IT'S EVER SPRING AGAIN” (SONG) If it's ever spring again, Spring again, I shall go where went I when Down the moor-cock splashed, and hen, Seeing me not, amid their flounder, Standing with my arm around her; If it's ever spring again, Spring again, I shall go where went I then. If it's ever summer-time, Summer-time, With the hay crop at the prime, And the cuckoos—two—in rhyme, As they used to be, or seemed to, We shall do as long we've dreamed to, If it's ever summer-time, Summer-time, With the hay, and bees achime. THE TWO HOUSES In the heart of night, When farers were not near, The left house said to the house on the right, “I have marked your rise, O smart newcomer here.” Said the right, cold-eyed: “Newcomer here I am, Hence haler than you with your cracked old hide, Loose casements, wormy beams, and doors that jam. “Modern my wood, My hangings fair of hue; While my windows open as they should, And water-pipes thread all my chambers through. “Your gear is gray, Your face wears furrows untold.” “—Yours might,” mourned the other, “if you held, brother, The Presences from aforetime that I hold. “You have not known Men's lives, deaths, toils, and teens; You are but a heap of stick and stone: A new house has no sense of the have-beens. “Void as a drum You stand: I am packed with these, Though, strangely, living dwellers who come See not the phantoms all my substance sees! “Visible in the morning Stand they, when dawn drags in; Visible at night; yet hint or warning Of these thin elbowers few of the inmates win. “Babes new-brought-forth Obsess my rooms; straight-stretched Lank corpses, ere outborne to earth; Yea, throng they as when first from the Byss upfetched. “Dancers and singers Throb in me now as once; Rich-noted throats and gossamered flingers Of heels; the learned in love-lore and the dunce. “Note here within The bridegroom and the bride, Who smile and greet their friends and kin, And down my stairs depart for tracks untried. “Where such inbe, A dwelling's character Takes theirs, and a vague semblancy To them in all its limbs, and light, and atmosphere. “Yet the blind folk My tenants, who come and go In the flesh mid these, with souls unwoke, Of such sylph-like surrounders do not know.” “—Will the day come,” Said the new one, awestruck, faint, “When I shall lodge shades dim and dumb— And with such spectral guests become acquaint?” “—That will it, boy; Such shades will people thee, Each in his misery, irk, or joy, And print on thee their presences as on me.” ON STINSFORD HILL AT MIDNIGHT I glimpsed a woman's muslined form Sing-songing airily Against the moon; and still she sang, And took no heed of me. Another trice, and I beheld What first I had not scanned, That now and then she tapped and shook A timbrel in her hand. So late the hour, so white her drape, So strange the look it lent To that blank hill, I could not guess What phantastry it meant. Then burst I forth: “Why such from you? Are you so happy now?” Her voice swam on; nor did she show Thought of me anyhow. I called again: “Come nearer; much That kind of note I need!” The song kept softening, loudening on, In placid calm unheed. “What home is yours now?” then I said “You seem to have no care.” But the wild wavering tune went forth As if I had not been there. “This world is dark, and where you are,” I said, “I cannot be!” But still the happy one sang on, And had no heed of me. It was said that she belonged to a body of religious enthusiasts. THE FALLOW DEER AT THE LONELY HOUSE One without looks in to-night Through the curtain-chink From the sheet of glistening white; One without looks in to-night As we sit and think By the fender-brink. We do not discern those eyes Watching in the snow; Lit by lamps of rosy dyes We do not discern those eyes Wondering, aglow, Fourfooted, tiptoe. THE SELFSAME SONG A bird sings the selfsame song, With never a fault in its flow, That we listened to here those long Long years ago. A pleasing marvel is how A strain of such rapturous rote Should have gone on thus till now Unchanged in a note! —But it's not the selfsame bird.— No: perished to dust is he. . . . As also are those who heard That song with me. THE WANDERER There is nobody on the road But I, And no beseeming abode I can try For shelter, so abroad I must lie. The stars feel not far up, And to be The lights by which I sup Glimmeringly, Set out in a hollow cup Over me. They wag as though they were Panting for joy Where they shine, above all care. And annoy, And demons of despair— Life's alloy. Sometimes outside the fence Feet swing past, Clock-like, and then go hence, Till at last There is a silence, dense, Deep, and vast. A wanderer, witch-drawn To and fro, To-morrow, at the dawn, On I go, And where I rest anon Do not know! Yet it's meet—this bed of hay And roofless plight; For there's a house of clay, My own, quite, To roof me soon, all day And all night. A WIFE COMES BACK This is the story a man told me Of his life's one day of dreamery. A woman came into his room Between the dawn and the creeping day. She was the years-wed wife from whom He had parted, and who lived far away, As if strangers they. He wondered, and as she stood She put on youth in her look and air, And more was he wonderstruck as he viewed Her form and flesh bloom yet more fair While he watched her there; Till she freshed to the pink and brown That were hers on the night when first they met, When she was the charm of the idle town, And he the pick of the club-fire set. . . . His eyes grew wet, And he stretched his arms: “Stay—rest!—” He cried. “Abide with me so, my own!” But his arms closed in on his hard bare breast; She had vanished with all he had looked upon Of her beauty: gone. He clothed, and drew downstairs, But she was not in the house, he found; And he passed out under the leafy pairs Of the avenue elms, and searched around To the park-pale bound. He mounted, and rode till night To the city to which she had long withdrawn, The vision he bore all day in his sight Being her young self as pondered on In the dim of dawn. “—The lady here long ago— Is she now here?—young—or such age as she is?” “—She is still here.”—“Thank God. Let her know; She'll pardon a comer so late as this Whom she'd fain not miss.” She received him—an ancient dame, Who hemmed, with features frozen and numb, “How strange!—I'd almost forgotten your name!— A call just now—is troublesome; Why did you come?” A YOUNG MAN'S EXHORTATION Call off your eyes from care By some determined deftness; put forth joys Dear as excess without the core that cloys, And charm Life's lourings fair. Exalt and crown the hour That girdles us, and fill it full with glee, Blind glee, excelling aught could ever be Were heedfulness in power. Send up such touching strains That limitless recruits from Fancy's pack Shall rush upon your tongue, and tender back All that your soul contains. For what do we know best? That a fresh love-leaf crumpled soon will dry, And that men moment after moment die, Of all scope dispossest. If I have seen one thing It is the passing preciousness of dreams; That aspects are within us; and who seems Most kingly is the King. 1867: Westbourne Park Villas. AT LULWORTH COVE A CENTURY BACK Had I but lived a hundred years ago I might have gone, as I have gone this year, By Warmwell Cross on to a Cove I know, And Time have placed his finger on me there: “You see that man?”—I might have looked, and said, “O yes: I see him. One that boat has brought Which dropped down Channel round Saint Alban's Head. So commonplace a youth calls not my thought.” “You see that man?”—“Why yes; I told you; yes: Of an idling town-sort; thin; hair brown in hue; And as the evening light scants less and less He looks up at a star, as many do.” “You see that man?”—“Nay, leave me!” then I plead, “I have fifteen miles to vamp across the lea, And it grows dark, and I am weary-kneed: I have said the third time; yes, that man I see!” “Good. That man goes to Rome—to death, despair; And no one notes him now but you and I: A hundred years, and the world will follow him there, And bend with reverence where his ashes lie.” September 1920. In September 1820 Keats, on his way to Rome, landed one day on the Dorset coast, and composed the sonnet, “Bright star! would I were steadfast as thou art.” The spot of his landing is judged to have been Lulworth Cove. A BYGONE OCCASION (SONG) That night, that night, That song, that song! Will such again be evened quite Through lifetimes long? No mirth was shown To outer seers, But mood to match has not been known In modern years. O eyes that smiled, O lips that lured; That such would last was one beguiled To think ensured! That night, that night, That song, that song; O drink to its recalled delight, Though tears may throng! TWO SERENADES I On Christmas Eve Late on Christmas Eve, in the street alone, Outside a house, on the pavement-stone, I sang to her, as we'd sung together On former eves ere I felt her tether.— Above the door of green by me Was she, her casement seen by me; But she would not heed What I melodied In my soul's sore need— She would not heed. Cassiopeia overhead, And the Seven of the Wain, heard what I said As I bent me there, and voiced, and fingered Upon the strings. . . . Long, long I lingered: Only the curtains hid from her One whom caprice had bid from her; But she did not come, And my heart grew numb And dull my strum; She did not come. II A Year Later I skimmed the strings; I sang quite low; I hoped she would not come or know That the house next door was the one now dittied, Not hers, as when I had played unpitied; —Next door, where dwelt a heart fresh stirred, My new Love, of good will to me, Unlike my old Love chill to me, Who had not cared for my notes when heard: Yet that old Love came To the other's name As hers were the claim; Yea, the old Love came. My viol sank-mute, my tongue stood still, I tried to sing on, but vain my will: I prayed she would guess of the later, and leave me; She stayed, as though, were she slain by the smart, She would bear love's burn for a newer heart. The tense-drawn moment wrought to bereave me Of voice, and I turned in a dumb despair At her finding I'd come to another there. Sick I withdrew At love's grim hue Ere my last Love knew; Sick I withdrew. From an old copy. THE WEDDING MORNING Tabitha dressed for her wedding:— “Tabby, why look so sad?” “—O I feel a great gloominess spreading, spreading, Instead of supremely glad! . . . “I called on Carry last night, And he came whilst I was there, Not knowing I'd called. So I kept out of sight, And I heard what he said to her: “‘—Ah, I'd far liefer marry You, Dear, to-morrow!’ he said, ‘But that cannot be.’—O I'd give him to Carry, And willingly see them wed, “But how can I do it when His baby will soon be born? After that I hope I may die. And then She can have him. I shall not mourn!” END OF THE YEAR 1912 You were here at his young beginning, You are not here at his agèd end; Off he coaxed you from Life's mad spinning, Lest you should see his form extend Shivering, sighing, Slowly dying, And a tear on him expend. So it comes that we stand lonely In the star-lit avenue, Dropping broken lipwords only, For we hear no songs from you, Such as flew here For the new year Once, while six bells swung thereto. THE CHIMES PLAY “LIFE'S A BUMPER!” “Awake! I'm off to cities far away,” I said; and rose, on peradventures bent. The chimes played “Life's a Bumper!” long that day To the measure of my walking as I went: Their sweetness frisked and floated on the lea, As they played out “Life's a Bumper!” there to me. “Awake!” I said. “I go to take a bride!” —The sun arose behind me ruby-red As I journeyed townwards from the countryside, The chiming bells saluting near ahead. Their sweetness swelled in tripping tings of glee As they played out “Life's a Bumper!” there to me. “Again arise.” I seek a turfy slope, And go forth slowly on an autumn noon, And there I lay her who has been my hope, And think, “O may I follow hither soon!” While on the wind the chimes come cheerily, Playing out “Life's a Bumper!” there to me. 1913. “I WORKED NO WILE TO MEET YOU” (SONG) I worked no wile to meet you, My sight was set elsewhere, I sheered about to shun you, And lent your life no care. I was unprimed to greet you At such a date and place, Constraint alone had won you Vision of my strange face! You did not seek to see me Then or at all, you said, —Meant passing when you neared me, But stumbling-blocks forbade. You even had thought to flee me, By other mindings moved; No influent star endeared me, Unknown, unrecked, unproved! What, then, was there to tell us The flux of flustering hours Of their own tide would bring us By no device of ours To where the daysprings well us Heart-hydromels that cheer, Till Time enearth and swing us Round with the turning sphere. AT THE RAILWAY STATION, UPWAY “There is not much that I can do, For I've no money that's quite my own!” Spoke up the pitying child— A little boy with a violin At the station before the train came in,— “But I can play my fiddle to you, And a nice one 'tis, and good in tone!” The man in the handcuffs smiled; The constable looked, and he smiled, too, As the fiddle began to twang; And the man in the handcuffs suddenly sang With grimful glee: “This life so free Is the thing for me!” And the constable smiled, and said no word, As if unconscious of what he heard; And so they went on till the train came in— The convict, and boy with the violin. SIDE BY SIDE So there sat they, The estranged two, Thrust in one pew By chance that day; Placed so, breath-nigh, Each comer unwitting Who was to be sitting In touch close by. Thus side by side Blindly alighted, They seemed united As groom and bride, Who'd not communed For many years— Lives from twain spheres With hearts distuned. Her fringes brushed His garment's hem As the harmonies rushed Through each of them: Her lips could be heard In the creed and psalms, And their fingers neared At the giving of alms. And women and men, The matins ended, By looks commended Them, joined again. Quickly said she, “Don't undeceive them— Better thus leave them:” “Quite so,” said he. Slight words!—the last Between them said, Those two, once wed, Who had not stood fast. Diverse their ways From the western door, To meet no more In their span of days. DREAM OF THE CITY SHOPWOMAN 'Twere sweet to have a comrade here, Who'd vow to love this garreteer, By city people's snap and sneer Tried oft and hard! We'd rove a truant cock and hen To some snug solitary glen, And never be seen to haunt again This teeming yard. Within a cot of thatch and clay We'd list the flitting pipers play, Our lives a twine of good and gay Enwreathed discreetly; Our blithest deeds so neighbouring wise That doves should coo in soft surprise, “These must belong to Paradise Who live so sweetly.” Our clock should be the closing flowers, Our sprinkle-bath the passing showers, Our church the alleyed willow bowers, The truth our theme; And infant shapes might soon abound: Their shining heads would dot us round Like mushroom balls on grassy ground. —But all is dream! O God, that creatures framed to feel A yearning nature's strong appeal Should writhe on this eternal wheel In rayless grime; And vainly note, with wan regret, Each star of early promise set; Till Death relieves, and they forget Their one Life's time! Westbourne Park Villas, 1866. A MAIDEN'S PLEDGE (SONG) I do not wish to win your vow To take me soon or late as bride, And lift me from the nook where now I tarry your farings to my side. I am blissful ever to abide In this green labyrinth—let all be, If but, whatever may betide, You do not leave off loving me! Your comet-comings I will wait With patience time shall not wear through; The yellowing years will not abate My largened love and truth to you, Nor drive me to complaint undue Of absence, much as I may pine, If never another 'twixt us two Shall come, and you stand wholly mine. THE CHILD AND THE SAGE You say, O Sage, when weather-checked, “I have been favoured so With cloudless skies, I must expect This dash of rain or snow.” “Since health has been my lot,” you say, “So many months of late, I must not chafe that one short day Of sickness mars my state.” You say, “Such bliss has been my share From Love's unbroken smile, It is but reason I should bear A cross therein awhile.” And thus you do not count upon Continuance of joy; But, when at ease, expect anon A burden of annoy. But, Sage—this Earth—why not a place Where no reprisals reign, Where never a spell of pleasantness Makes reasonable a pain? December 21, 1908. MISMET I He was leaning by a face, He was looking into eyes, And he knew a trysting-place, And he heard seductive sighs; But the face, And the eyes, And the place, And the sighs, Were not, alas, the right ones—the ones meet for him— Though fine and sweet the features, and the feelings all abrim. II She was looking at a form, She was listening for a tread, She could feel a waft of charm When a certain name was said; But the form, And the tread, And the charm, And name said, Were the wrong ones for her, and ever would be so, While the heritor of the right it would have saved her soul to know! AN AUTUMN RAIN-SCENE There trudges one to a merry-making With a sturdy swing, On whom the rain comes down. To fetch the saving medicament Is another bent, On whom the rain comes down. One slowly drives his herd to the stall Ere ill befall, On whom the rain comes down. This bears his missives of life and death With quickening breath, On whom the rain comes down. One watches for signals of wreck or war From the hill afar, On whom the rain comes down. No care if he gain a shelter or none, Unhired moves one, On whom the rain comes down. And another knows nought of its chilling fall Upon him at all, On whom the rain comes down. October 1904. MEDITATIONS ON A HOLIDAY (A NEW THEME TO AN OLD FOLK-MEASURE) 'Tis a May morning, All-adorning, No cloud warning Of rain to-day. Where shall I go to, Go to, go to?— Can I say No to Lyonnesse-way? Well—what reason Now at this season Is there for treason To other shrines? Tristram is not there, Isolt forgot there, New eras blot there Sought-for signs! Stratford-on-Avon— Poesy-paven— I'll find a haven There, somehow!— Nay—I'm but caught of Dreams long thought of, The Swan knows nought of His Avon now! What shall it be, then, I go to see, then, Under the plea, then, Of votary? I'll go to Lakeland, Lakeland, Lakeland, Certainly Lakeland Let it be. But—why to that place, That place, that place, Such a hard come-at place Need I fare? When its bard cheers no more, Loves no more, fears no more, Sees no more, hears no more Anything there! Ah, there is Scotland, Burns's Scotland, And Waverley's. To what land Better can I hie?— Yet—if no whit now Feel those of it now— Care not a bit now For it—why I? I'll seek a town street, Aye, a brick-brown street, Quite a tumbledown street, Drawing no eyes. For a Mary dwelt there, And a Percy felt there Heart of him melt there, A Claire likewise. Why incline to that city, Such a city, that city, Now a mud-bespat city!— Care the lovers who Now live and walk there, Sit there and talk there, Buy there, or hawk there. Or wed, or woo? Laughters in a volley Greet so fond a folly As nursing melancholy In this and that spot, Which, with most endeavour, Those can visit never, But for ever and ever Will now know not! If, on lawns Elysian, With a broadened vision And a faint derision Conscious be they, How they might reprove me That these fancies move me, Think they ill behoove me, Smile, and say: “What!—our hoar old houses, Where the bygone drowses, Nor a child nor spouse is Of our name at all? Such abodes to care for, Inquire about and bear for, And suffer wear and tear for— How weak of you and small!” May 1921. AN EXPERIENCE Wit, weight, or wealth there was not In anything that was said, In anything that was done; All was of scope to cause not A triumph, dazzle, or dread To even the subtlest one, My friend, To even the subtlest one. But there was a new afflation— An aura zephyring round That care infected not: It came as a salutation, And, in my sweet astound, I scarcely witted what Might pend, I scarcely witted what. The hills in samewise to me Spoke, as they grayly gazed, —First hills to speak so yet! The thin-edged breezes blew me What I, though cobwebbed, crazed Was never to forget, My friend, Was never to forget! THE BEAUTY O do not praise my beauty more. In such word-wild degree, And say I am one all eyes adore; For these things harass me! But do for ever softly say: “From now unto the end Come weal, come wanzing, come what may, Dear, I will be your friend.” I hate my beauty in the glass: My beauty is not I: I wear it: none cares whether, alas, Its wearer live or die! The inner I O care for, then, Yea, me and what I am, And shall be at the gray hour when My cheek begins to clam. “The Regent Street beauty, Miss Verrey, the Swiss confectioner's daughter, whose personal attractions have been so mischievously exaggerated, died of fever on Monday evening, brought on by the annoyance she had been for some time subject to.” —London paper, October 1828. THE COLLECTOR CLEANS HIS PICTURE Fili hominis, ecce ego tollo a te desiderabile oculorum tuorum in plaga. —Ezech. xxiv. 16. How I remember cleaning that strange picture! . . . I had been deep in duty for my sick neighbour— His besides my own—over several Sundays, Often, too, in the week; so with parish pressures, Baptisms, burials, doctorings, conjugal counsel— All the whatnots asked of a rural parson— Faith, I was well-nigh broken, should have been fully Saving for one small secret relaxation, One that in mounting manhood had grown my hobby. This was to delve at whiles for easel-lumber, Stowed in the backmost slums of a soon-reached city, Merely on chance to uncloak some worthy canvas, Panel, or plaque, blacked blind by uncouth adventure, Yet under all concealing a precious artfeat. Such I had found not yet. My latest capture Came from the rooms of a trader in ancient house-gear Who had no scent of beauty or soul for brushcraft. Only a tittle cost it—murked with grimefilms, Gatherings of slow years, thick-varnished over, Never a feature manifest of man's painting. So, one Saturday, time ticking hard on midnight Ere an hour subserved, I set me upon it. Long with coiled-up sleeves I cleaned and yet cleaned, Till a first fresh spot, a high light, looked forth, Then another, like fair flesh, and another; Then a curve, a nostril, and next a finger, Tapering, shapely, significantly pointing slantwise. “Flemish?” I said. “Nay, Spanish. . . . But, nay, Italian!” —Then meseemed it the guise of the ranker Venus, Named of some Astarte, of some Cotytto. Down I knelt before it and kissed the panel, Drunk with the lure of love's inhibited dreamings. Till the dawn I rubbed, when there leered up at me A hag, that had slowly emerged from under my hands there, Pointing the slanted finger towards a bosom Eaten away of a rot from the lusts of a lifetime. . . —I could have ended myself at the lashing lesson! Stunned I sat till roused by a clear-voiced bell-chime, Fresh and sweet as the dew-fleece under my luthern. It was the matin service calling to me From the adjacent steeple. THE WOOD FIRE (A FRAGMENT) “This is a brightsome blaze you've lit, good friend, to-night!” “—Aye, it has been the bleakest spring I have felt for years, And nought compares with cloven logs to keep alight: I buy them bargain-cheap of the executioners, As I dwell near; and they wanted the crosses out of sight By Passover, not to affront the eyes of visitors. “Yes, they're from the crucifixions last week-ending At Kranion. We can sometimes use the poles again, But they get split by the nails, and 'tis quicker work than mending To knock together new; though the uprights now and then Serve twice when they're let stand. But if a feast's impending, As lately, you've to tidy up for the comers' ken. “Though only three were impaled, you may know it didn't pass off So quietly as was wont? That Galilee carpenter's son Who boasted he was king, incensed the rabble to scoff: I heard the noise from my garden. This piece is the one he was on. . . . Yes, it blazes up well if lit with a few dry chips and shroff; And it's worthless for much else, what with cuts and stains thereon.” SAYING GOOD-BYE (SONG) We are always saying “Good-bye, good-bye!” In work, in playing, In gloom, in gaying: At many a stage Of pilgrimage From youth to age We say, “Good-bye, Good-bye!” We are undiscerning Which go to sigh, Which will be yearning For soon returning; And which no more Will dark our door, Or tread our shore, But go to die, To die. Some come from roaming With joy again; Some, who come homing By stealth at gloaming, Had better have stopped Till death, and dropped By strange hands propped, Than come so fain, So fain. So, with this saying, “Good-bye, good-bye,” We speed their waying Without betraying Our grief, our fear No more to hear From them, close, clear, Again: “Good-bye, Good-bye!” ON THE TUNE CALLED THE OLD-HUNDRED AND-FOURTH We never sang together Ravenscroft's terse old tune On Sundays or on weekdays, In sharp or summer weather, At night-time or at noon. Why did we never sing it, Why never so incline On Sundays or on weekdays, Even when soft wafts would wing it From your far floor to mine? Shall we that tune, then, never Stand voicing side by side On Sundays or on weekdays? . . . Or shall we, when for ever In Sheol we abide, Sing it in desolation, As we might long have done On Sundays or on weekdays With love and exultation Before our sands had run? THE OPPORTUNITY (FOR H. P.) Forty springs back, I recall, We met at this phase of the Maytime: We might have clung close through all, But we parted when died that daytime. We parted with smallest regret; Perhaps should have cared but slightly, Just then, if we never had met: Strange, strange that we lived so lightly! Had we mused a little space At that critical date in the Maytime, One life had been ours, one place, Perhaps, till our long cold claytime. —This is a bitter thing For thee, O man: what ails it? The tide of chance may bring Its offer; but nought avails it! EVELYN G. OF CHRISTMINSTER I can see the towers In mind quite clear Not many hours' Faring from here; But how up and go, And briskly bear Thither, and know That you are not there? Though the birds sing small, And apple and pear On your trees by the wall Are ripe and rare, Though none excel them, I have no care To taste them or smell them And you not there. Though the College stones Are stroked with the sun, And the gownsmen and Dons Who held you as one Of brightest brow Still think as they did, Why haunt with them now Your candle is hid? Towards the river A pealing swells: They cost me a quiver— Those prayerful bells! How go to God, Who can reprove With so heavy a rod As your swift remove! The chorded keys Wait all in a row, And the bellows wheeze As long ago. And the psalter lingers, And organist's chair; But where are your fingers That once wagged there? Shall I then seek That desert place This or next week, And those tracks trace That fill me with cark And cloy; nowhere Being movement or mark Of you now there! THE RIFT (Song: Minor Mode) 'Twas just at gnat and cobweb-time, When yellow begins to show in the leaf, That your old gamut changed its chime From those true tones—of span so brief!— That met my beats of joy, of grief, As rhyme meets rhyme. So sank I from my high sublime! We faced but chancewise after that, And never I knew or guessed my crime. . . . Yes; 'twas the date—or nigh thereat— Of the yellowing leaf; at moth and gnat And cobweb-time. VOICES FROM THINGS GROWING IN A CHURCHYARD These flowers are I, poor Fanny Hurd, Sir or Madam, A little girl here sepultured. Once I flit-fluttered like a bird Above the grass, as now I wave In daisy shapes above my grave, All day cheerily, All night eerily! —I am one Bachelor Bowring, “Gent,” Sir or Madam; In shingled oak my bones were pent; Hence more than a hundred years I spent In my feat of change from a coffin-thrall To a dancer in green as leaves on a wall, All day cheerily, All night eerily! —I, these berries of juice and gloss, Sir or Madam, Am clean forgotten as Thomas Voss; Thin-urned, I have burrowed away from the moss That covers my sod, and have entered this yew, And turned to clusters ruddy of view, All day cheerily, All night eerily! —The Lady Gertrude, proud, high-bred, Sir or Madam, Am I—this laurel that shades your head; Into its veins I have stilly sped, And made them of me; and my leaves now shine, As did my satins superfine, All day cheerily, All night eerily! —I, who as innocent withwind climb, Sir or Madam, Am one Eve Greensleeves, in olden time Kissed by men from many a clime, Beneath sun, stars, in blaze, in breeze, As now by glowworms and by bees, All day cheerily, All night eerily! It was said her real name was Eve Trevillian or Trevelyan; and that she was the handsome mother of two or three illegitimate children, circa 1784–95. —I'm old Squire Audeley Grey, who grew Sir or Madam, A weary of life, and in scorn withdrew; Till anon I clambered up anew As ivy-green, when my ache was stayed, And in that attire I have longtime gayed All day cheerily, All night eerily! —And so these maskers breathe to each Sir or Madam Who lingers there, and their lively speech Affords an interpreter much to teach, As their murmurous accents seem to come Thence hitheraround in a radiant hum, All day cheerily, All night eerily! ON THE WAY The trees fret fitfully and twist, Shutters rattle and carpets heave, Slime is the dust of yestereve, And in the streaming mist Fishes might seem to fin a passage if they list. But to his feet, Drawing nigh and nigher A hidden seat, The fog is sweet And the wind a lyre. A vacant sameness grays the sky, A moisture gathers on each knop Of the bramble, rounding to a drop, That greets the goer-by With the cold listless lustre of a dead man's eye But to her sight, Drawing nigh and nigher Its deep delight, The fog is bright And the wind a lyre. “SHE DID NOT TURN” She did not turn, But passed foot-faint with averted head In her gown of green, by the bobbing fern, Though I leaned over the gate that led From where we waited with table spread; But she did not turn: Why was she near there if love had fled? She did not turn, Though the gate was whence I had often sped In the mists of morning to meet her, and learn Her heart, when its moving moods I read As a book—she mine, as she sometimes said; But she did not turn, And passed foot-faint with averted head. GROWTH IN MAY I enter a daisy-and-buttercup land, And thence thread a jungle of grass: Hurdles and stiles scarce visible stand Above the lush stems as I pass. Hedges peer over, and try to be seen, And seem to reveal a dim sense That amid such ambitious and elbow-high green They make a mean show as a fence. Elsewhere the mead is possessed of the neats, That range not greatly above The rich rank thicket which brushes their teats, And her gown, as she waits for her Love. Near Chard. THE CHILDREN AND SIR NAMELESS Sir Nameless, once of Athelhall, declared: “These wretched children romping in my park Trample the herbage till the soil is bared, And yap and yell from early morn till dark! Go keep them harnessed to their set routines: Thank God I've none to hasten my decay; For green remembrance there are better means Than offspring, who but wish their sires away.” Sir Nameless of that mansion said anon: “To be perpetuate for my mightiness Sculpture must image me when I am gone.” —He forthwith summoned carvers there express To shape a figure stretching seven-odd feet (For he was tall) in alabaster stone, With shield, and crest, and casque, and sword complete: When done a statelier work was never known. Three hundred years hied; Church-restorers came, And, no one of his lineage being traced, They thought an effigy so large in frame Best fitted for the floor. There it was placed, Under the seats for schoolchildren. And they Kicked out his name, and hobnailed off his nose; And, as they yawn through sermon-time, they say, “Who was this old stone man beneath our toes?” AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY These summer landscapes—clump, and copse, and croft— Woodland and meadowland—here hung aloft, Gay with limp grass and leafery new and soft, Seem caught from the immediate season's yield I saw last noonday shining over the field, By rapid snatch, while still are uncongealed The saps that in their live originals climb; Yester's quick greenage here set forth in mime Just as it stands, now, at our breathing-time. But these young foils so fresh upon each tree, Soft verdures spread in sprouting novelty, Are not this summer's though they feign to be. Last year their May to Michaelmas term was run, Last autumn browned and buried every one, And no more know they sight of any sun. HER TEMPLE Dear, think not that they will forget you: —If craftsmanly art should be mine I will build up a temple, and set you Therein as its shrine. They may say: “Why a woman such honour?” —Be told, “O, so sweet was her fame, That a man heaped this splendour upon her; None now knows his name.” A TWO-YEARS' IDYLL Yes; such it was; Just those two seasons unsought, Sweeping like summertide wind on our ways; Moving, as straws, Hearts quick as ours in those days; Going like wind, too, and rated as nought Save as the prelude to plays Soon to come—larger, life-fraught: Yes; such it was. “Nought” it was called, Even by ourselves—that which springs Out of the years for all flesh, first or last, Commonplace, scrawled Dully on days that go past. Yet, all the while, it upbore us like wings Even in hours overcast: Aye, though this best thing of things, “Nought” it was called! What seems it now? Lost: such beginning was all; Nothing came after: romance straight forsook Quickly somehow Life when we sped from our nook, Primed for new scenes with designs smart and tall. . . . —A preface without any book, A trumpet uplipped, but no call; That seems it now. BY HENSTRIDGE CROSS AT THE YEAR'S END (From this centuries-old cross-road the highway leads east to London, north to Bristol and Bath, west to Exeter and the Land's End, and south to the Channel coast.) Why go the east road now? . . . That way a youth went on a morrow After mirth, and he brought back sorrow Painted upon his brow: Why go the east road now? Why go the north road now? Torn, leaf-strewn, as if scoured by foemen, Once edging fiefs of my forefolk yeomen, Fallows fat to the plough: Why go the north road now? Why go the west road now? Thence to us came she, bosom-burning, Welcome with joyousness returning. . . . She sleeps under the bough: Why go the west road now? Why go the south road now? That way marched they some are forgetting, Stark to the moon left, past regretting Loves who have falsed their vow. . . . Why go the south road now? Why go any road now? White stands the handpost for brisk onbearers, “Halt!” is the word for wan-cheeked farers Musing on Whither, and How. . . . Why go any road now? “Yea: we want new feet now” Answer the stones. “Want chit-chat, laughter: Plenty of such to go hereafter By our tracks, we trow! We are for new feet now.” During the War. PENANCE “Why do you sit, O pale thin man, At the end of the room By that harpsichord, built on the quaint old plan? —It is cold as a tomb, And there's not a spark within the grate; And the jingling wires Are as vain desires That have lagged too late.” “Why do I? Alas, far times ago A woman lyred here In the evenfall; one who fain did so From year to year; And, in loneliness bending wistfully, Would wake each note In sick sad rote, None to listen or see! “I would not join. I would not stay, But drew away, Though the winter fire beamed brightly. . . . Aye! I do to-day What I would not then; and the chill old keys, Like a skull's brown teeth Loose in their sheath, Freeze my touch; yes, freeze.” “I LOOK IN HER FACE” (SONG: Minor) I look in her face and say, “Sing as you used to sing About Love's blossoming”; But she hints not Yea or Nay. “Sing, then, that Love's a pain, If, Dear, you think it so, Whether it be or no;” But dumb her lips remain. I go to a far-off room, A faint song ghosts my ear; Which song I cannot hear, But it seems to come from a tomb. AFTER THE WAR Last Post sounded Across the mead To where he loitered With absent heed. Five years before In the evening there Had flown that call To him and his Dear. “You'll never come back; Good-bye!” she had said; “Here I'll be living, And my Love dead!” Those closing minims Had been as shafts darting Through him and her pressed In that last parting; They thrilled him not now, In the selfsame place With the selfsame sun On his war-seamed face. “Lurks a god's laughter In this?” he said, “That I am the living And she the dead!” “IF YOU HAD KNOWN” If you had known When listening with her to the far-down moan Of the white-selvaged and empurpled sea, And rain came on that did not hinder talk, Or damp your flashing facile gaiety In turning home, despite the slow wet walk By crooked ways, and over stiles of stone; If you had known You would lay roses, Fifty years thence, on her monument, that discloses Its graying shape upon the luxuriant green; Fifty years thence to an hour, by chance led there, What might have moved you?—yea, had you foreseen That on the tomb of the selfsame one, gone where The dawn of every day is as the close is, You would lay roses! 1920. THE CHAPEL-ORGANIST (A.D. 185?) I've been thinking it through, as I play here to-night, to play never again, By the light of that lowering sun peering in at the window-pane, And over the back-street roofs, throwing shades from the boys of the chore In the gallery, right upon me, sitting up to these keys once more. . . . How I used to hear tongues ask, as I sat here when I was new: “Who is she playing the organ? She touches it mightily true!” “She travels from Havenpool Town,” the deacon would softly speak, “The stipend can hardly cover her fare hither twice in the week.” (It fell far short of doing, indeed; but I never told, For I have craved minstrelsy more than lovers, or beauty, or gold.) 'Twas so he answered at first, but the story grew different later: “It cannot go on much longer, from what we hear of her now!” At the meaning wheeze in the words the inquirer would shift his place Till he could see round the curtain that screened me from people below. “A handsome girl,” he would murmur, upstaring (and so I am). “But—too much sex in her build; fine eyes, but eyelids too heavy; A bosom too full for her age; in her lips too voluptuous a dye.” (It may be. But who put it there? Assuredly it was not I.) I went on playing and singing when this I had heard, and more, Though tears half-blinded me; yes, I remained going on and on, Just as I used me to chord and to sing at the selfsame time! . . . For it's a contralto—my voice is; they'll hear it again here to-night In the psalmody notes that I love far beyond every lower delight. Well, the deacon, in fact, that day had learnt new tidings about me; They troubled his mind not a little, for he was a worthy man. (He trades as a chemist in High Street, and during the week he had sought His fellow-deacon, who throve as a bookbinder over the way.) “These are strange rumours,” he said. “We must guard the good name of the chapel. If, sooth, she's of evil report, what else can we do but dismiss her?” “—But get such another to play here we cannot for double the price!” It settled the point for the time, and I triumphed awhile in their strait, And my much-beloved grand semibreves went living on, pending my fate. At length in the congregation more headshakes and murmurs were rife, And my dismissal was ruled, though I was not warned of it then. But a day came when they declared it. The news entered me as a sword; I was broken; so pallid of face that they thought I should faint, they said. I rallied. “O, rather than go, I will play you for nothing!” said I. 'Twas in much desperation I spoke it, for bring me to forfeit I could not Those melodies chorded so richly for which I had laboured and lived. They paused. And for nothing I played at the chapel through Sundays again, Upheld by that art which I loved more than blandishments lavished of men. But it fell that murmurs anew from the flock broke the pastor's peace. Some member had seen me at Havenpool, comrading close a sea-captain. (O yes; I was thereto constrained, lacking means for the fare to and fro.) Yet God knows, if aught He knows ever, I loved the Old-Hundredth, Saint Stephen's, Mount Zion, New Sabbath, Miles-Lane, Holy Rest, and Arabia, and Eaton, Above all embraces of body by wooers who sought me and won! . . . Next week 'twas declared I was seen coming home with a swain ere the sun. The deacons insisted then, strong; and forgiveness I did not implore. I saw all was lost for me, quite, but I made a last bid in my throbs. My bent, finding victual in lust, men's senses had libelled my soul, But the soul should die game, if I knew it! I turned to my masters and said: “I yield, Gentlemen, without parlance. But—let me just hymn you once more! It's a little thing, Sirs, that I ask; and a passion is music with me!” They saw that consent would cost nothing, and show as good grace, as knew I, Though tremble I did, and feel sick, as I paused thereat, dumb for their words. They gloomily nodded assent, saying, “Yes, if you care to. Once more, And only once more, understand.” To that with a bend I agreed. —“You've a fixed and a far-reaching look,” spoke one who had eyed me awhile. “I've a fixed and a far-reaching plan, and my look only showed it,” I smile. This evening of Sunday is come—the last of my functioning here. “She plays as if she were possessed!” they exclaim, glancing upward and round. “Such harmonies I never dreamt the old instrument capable of!” Meantime the sun lowers and goes; shades deepen; the lights are turned up, And the people voice out the last singing: tune Tallis: the Evening Hymn. (I wonder Dissenters sing Ken: it shows them more liberal in spirit At this little chapel down here than at certain new others I know.) I sing as I play. Murmurs some one: “No woman's throat richer than hers!” “True: in these parts,” think I. “But, my man, never more will its richness outspread.” And I sing with them onward: “The grave dread as little do I as my bed.” I lift up my feet from the pedals; and then, while my eyes are still wet From the symphonies born of my fingers, I do that whereon I am set, And draw from my “full round bosom” (their words; how can I help its heave?) A bottle blue-coloured and fluted—a vinaigrette, they may conceive— And before the choir measures my meaning, reads aught in my moves to and fro, I drink from the phial at a draught, and they think it a pick-me-up; so. Then I gather my books as to leave, bend over the keys as to pray. When they come to me motionless, stooping, quick death will have whisked me away. “Sure, nobody meant her to poison herself in her haste, after all!” The deacons will say as they carry me down and the night shadows fall, “Though the charges were true,” they will add. “It's a case red as scarlet withal!” I have never once minced it. Lived chaste I have not. Heaven knows it above! . . . But past all the heavings of passion—it's music has been my life-love! . . . That tune did go well—this last playing! . . . I reckon they'll bury me here. . . . Not a soul from the seaport my birthplace—will come, or bestow me . . . a tear. FETCHING HER An hour before the dawn, My friend, You lit your waiting bedside-lamp, Your breakfast-fire anon, And outing into the dark and damp You saddled, and set on. Thuswise, before the day, My friend, You sought her on her surfy shore, To fetch her thence away Unto your own new-builded door For a staunch lifelong stay. You said: “It seems to be, My friend, That I were bringing to my place The pure brine breeze, the sea, The mews—all her old sky and space, In bringing her with me!” —But time is prompt to expugn, My friend, Such magic-minted conjurings: The brought breeze fainted soon, And then the sense of seamews' wings, And the shore's sibilant tune. So, it had been more due, My friend, Perhaps, had you not pulled this flower From the craggy nook it knew, And set it in an alien bower; But left it where it grew! “COULD I BUT WILL” (Song: Verses 1, 3, key major; verse 2, key minor) Could I but will, Will to my bent, I'd have afar ones near me still, And music of rare ravishment, In strains that move the toes and heels! And when the sweethearts sat for rest The unbetrothed should foot with zest Ecstatic reels. Could I be head, Head-god, “Come, now, Dear girl,” I'd say, “whose flame is fled, Who liest with linen-banded brow, Stirred but by shakes from Earth's deep core—” I'd say to her: “Unshroud and meet That Love who kissed and called thee Sweet!— Yea, come once more!” Even half-god power In spinning dooms Had I, this frozen scene should flower, And sand-swept plains and Arctic glooms Should green them gay with waving leaves, Mid which old friends and I would walk With weightless feet and magic talk Uncounted eves. SHE REVISITS ALONE THE CHURCH OF HER MARRIAGE I have come to the church and chancel, Where all's the same! —Brighter and larger in my dreams Truly it shaped than now, meseems Is its substantial frame. But, anyhow, I made my vow, Whether for praise or blame. Here in this church and chancel Where all's the same. Where touched the check-floored chance My knees and his? The step looks shyly at the sun, And says, “'Twas here the thing was done, For bale or else for bliss!” Of all those there I least was ware Would it be that or this When touched the check-floored chancel My knees and his! Here in this fateful chancel Where all's the same, I thought the culminant crest of life Was reached when I went forth the wife I was not when I came. Each commonplace one of my race, Some say, has such an aim— To go from a fateful chancel As not the same. Here, through this hoary chancel Where all's the same, A thrill, a gaiety even, ranged That morning when it seemed I changed My nature with my name. Though now not fair, though gray my hair, He loved me, past proclaim, Here in this hoary chancel, Where all's the same. AT THE ENTERING OF THE NEW YEAR I (OLD STYLE) Our songs went up and out the chimney, And roused the home-gone husbandmen; Our allemands, our heys, poussettings, Our hands-across and back again, Sent rhythmic throbbings through the casements On to the white highway, Where nighted farers paused and muttered, “Keep it up well, do they!” The contrabasso's measured booming Sped at each bar to the parish bounds, To shepherds at their midnight lambings, To stealthy poachers on their rounds; And everybody caught full duly The notes of our delight, As Time unrobed the Youth of Promise Hailed by our sanguine sight. II (NEW STYLE) We stand in the dusk of a pine-tree limb, As if to give ear to the muffled peal, Brought or withheld at the breeze's whim; But our truest heed is to words that steal From the mantled ghost that looms in the gray, And seems, so far as our sense can see, To feature bereaved Humanity, As it sighs to the imminent year its say:— “O stay without, O stay without, Calm comely Youth, untasked, untired; Though stars irradiate thee about Thy entrance here is undesired. Open the gate not, mystic one; Must we avow what we would close confine? With thee, good friend, we would have converse none, Albeit the fault may not be thine.” December 31. During the War. THEY WOULD NOT COME I travelled to where in her lifetime She'd knelt at morning prayer, To call her up as if there; But she paid no heed to my suing, As though her old haunt could win not A thought from her spirit, or care. I went where my friend had lectioned The prophets in high declaim, That my soul's ear the same Full tones should catch as aforetime; But silenced by gear of the Present Was the voice that once there came! Where the ocean had sprayed our banquet I stood, to recall it as then: The same eluding again! No vision. Shows contingent Affrighted it further from me Even than from my home-den. When I found them no responders, But fugitives prone to flee From where they had used to be, It vouched I had been led hither As by night wisps in bogland, And bruised the heart of me! AFTER A ROMANTIC DAY The railway bore him through An earthen cutting out from a city: There was no scope for view, Though the frail light shed by a slim young moon Fell like a friendly tune. Fell like a liquid ditty, And the blank lack of any charm Of landscape did no harm. The bald steep cutting, rigid, rough, And moon-lit, was enough For poetry of place: its weathered face Formed a convenient sheet whereon The visions of his mind were drawn. THE TWO WIVES (SMOKER'S CLUB-STORY) I waited at home all the while they were boating together— My wife and my near neighbour's wife: Till there entered a woman I loved more than life, And we sat and sat on, and beheld the uprising dark weather, With a sense that some mischief was rife. Tidings came that the boat had capsized, and that one of the ladies Was drowned—which of them was unknown: And I marvelled—my friend's wife?—or was it my own Who had gone in such wise to the land where the sun as the shade is? —We learnt it was his had so gone. Then I cried in unrest: “He is free! But no good is releasing To him as it would be to me!” “—But it is,” said the woman I loved, quietly. “How?” I asked her. “—Because he has long loved me too without ceasing, And it's just the same thing, don't you see.” “I KNEW A LADY” (CLUB SONG) I knew a lady when the days Grew long, and evenings goldened; But I was not emboldened By her prompt eyes and winning ways. And when old Winter nipt the haws, “Another's wife I'll be, And then you'll care for me,” She said, “and think how sweet I was!” And soon she shone as another's wife: As such I often met her, And sighed, “How I regret her! My folly cuts me like a knife!” And then, to-day, her husband came, And moaned, “Why did you flout her? Well could I do without her! For both our burdens you are to blame!” A HOUSE WITH A HISTORY There is a house in a city street Some past ones made their own; Its floors were criss-crossed by their feet, And their babblings beat From ceiling to white hearth-stone. And who are peopling its parlours now? Who talk across its floor? Mere freshlings are they, blank of brow, Who read not how Its prime had passed before Their raw equipments, scenes, and says Afflicted its memoried face, That had seen every larger phase Of human ways Before these filled the place. To them that house's tale is theirs, No former voices call Aloud therein. Its aspect bears Their joys and cares Alone, from wall to wall. A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS I see the ghost of a perished day; I know his face, and the feel of his dawn: 'Twas he who took me far away To a spot strange and gray: Look at me, Day, and then pass on, But come again: yes, come anon! Enters another into view; His features are not cold or white, But rosy as a vein seen through: Too soon he smiles adieu. Adieu, O ghost-day of delight; But come and grace my dying sight. Enters the day that brought the kiss: He brought it in his foggy hand To where the mumbling river is, And the high clematis; It lent new colour to the land, And all the boy within me manned. Ah, this one. Yes, I know his name, He is the day that wrought a shine Even on a precinct common and tame, As 'twere of purposed aim. He shows him as a rainbow sign Of promise made to me and mine. The next stands forth in his morning clothes, And yet, despite their misty blue, They mark no sombre custom-growths That joyous living loathes, But a meteor act, that left in its queue A train of sparks my lifetime through. I almost tremble at his nod— This next in train—who looks at me As I were slave, and he were god Wielding an iron rod. I close my eyes; yet still is he In front there, looking mastery. In semblance of a face averse The phantom of the next one comes: I did not know what better or worse Chancings might bless or curse When his original glossed the thrums Of ivy, bringing that which numbs. Yes; trees were turning in their sleep Upon their windy pillows of gray When he stole in. Silent his creep On the grassed eastern steep. . . . I shall not soon forget that day, And what his third hour took away! HE FOLLOWS HIMSELF In a heavy time I dogged myself Along a louring way, Till my leading self to my following self Said: “Why do you hang on me So harassingly?” “I have watched you, Heart of mine,” I cried, “So often going astray And leaving me, that I have pursued, Feeling such truancy Ought not to be.” He said no more, and I dogged him on From noon to the dun of day By prowling paths, until anew He begged: “Please turn and flee!— What do you see?” “Methinks I see a man,” said I, “Dimming his hours to gray. I will not leave him while I know Part of myself is he Who dreams such dree!” “I go to my old friend's house,” he urged, “So do not watch me, pray!” “Well, I will leave you in peace,” said I, “Though of this poignancy You should fight free: “Your friend, O other me, is dead; You know not what you say.” —“That do I! And at his green-grassed door By night's bright galaxy I bend a knee.” —The yew-plumes moved like mockers' beards Though only boughs were they, And I seemed to go; yet still was there, And am, and there haunt we Thus bootlessly. THE SINGING WOMAN There was a singing woman Came riding across the mead At the time of the mild May weather, Tameless, tireless; This song she sung: “I am fair, I am young!” And many turned to heed. And the same singing woman Sat crooning in her need At the time of the winter weather; Friendless, fireless, She sang this song: “Life, thou'rt too long!” And there was none to heed. WITHOUT, NOT WITHIN HER It was what you bore with you, Woman, Not inly were, That throned you from all else human, However fair! It was that strange freshness you carried Into a soul Whereon no thought of yours tarried Two moments at all. And out from his spirit flew death, And bale, and ban, Like the corn-chaff under the breath Of the winnowing-fan. “O I WON'T LEAD A HOMELY LIFE” (To an old air) “O I won't lead a homely life As father's Jack and mother's Jill, But I will be a fiddler's wife, With music mine at will! Just a little tune, Another one soon, As I merrily fling my fill!” And she became a fiddler's Dear, And merry all day she strove to be; And he played and played afar and near, But never at home played he Any little tune Or late or soon; And sunk and sad was she! IN THE SMALL HOURS I lay in my bed and fiddled With a dreamland viol and bow, And the tunes flew back to my fingers I had melodied years ago. It was two or three in the morning When I fancy-fiddled so Long reels and country-dances, And hornpipes swift and slow. And soon anon came crossing The chamber in the gray Figures of jigging fieldfolk— Saviours of corn and hay— To the air of “Haste to the Wedding,” As after a wedding-day; Yea, up and down the middle In windless whirls went they! There danced the bride and bridegroom, And couples in a train, Gay partners time and travail Had longwhiles stilled amain! . . . It seemed a thing for weeping To find, at slumber's wane And morning's sly increeping, That Now, not Then, held reign. THE LITTLE OLD TABLE Creak, little wood thing, creak, When I touch you with elbow or knee; That is the way you speak Of one who gave you to me! You, little table, she brought— Brought me with her own hand, As she looked at me with a thought That I did not understand. —Whoever owns it anon, And hears it, will never know What a history hangs upon This creak from long ago. VAGG HOLLOW Vagg Hollow is a marshy spot on the old Roman Road near Ilchester, where “things” are seen. Merchandise was formerly fetched inland from the canal-boats at Load-Bridge by waggons this way. “What do you see in Vagg Hollow, Little boy, when you go In the morning at five on your lonely drive?” “—I see men's souls, who follow Till we've passed where the road lies low, When they vanish at our creaking! “They are like white faces speaking Beside and behind the waggon— One just as father's was when here. The waggoner drinks from his flagon, (Or he'd flinch when the Hollow is near) But he does not give me any. “Sometimes the faces are many; But I walk along by the horses, He asleep on the straw as we jog; And I hear the loud water-courses, And the drops from the trees in the fog, And watch till the day is breaking, “And the wind out by Tintinhull waking; I hear in it father's call As he called when I saw him dying, And he sat by the fire last Fall, And mother stood by sighing; But I'm not afraid at all!” THE DREAM IS—WHICH? I am laughing by the brook with her, Splashed in its tumbling stir; And then it is a blankness looms As if I walked not there, Nor she, but found me in haggard rooms, And treading a lonely stair. With radiant cheeks and rapid eyes We sit where none espies; Till a harsh change comes edging in As no such scene were there, But winter, and I were bent and thin, And cinder-gray my hair. We dance in heys around the hall, Weightless as thistleball; And then a curtain drops between, As if I danced not there, But wandered through a mounded green To find her, I knew where. March 1913. THE COUNTRY WEDDING (A FIDDLER'S STORY) Little fogs were gathered in every hollow, But the purple hillocks enjoyed fine weather As we marched with our fiddles over the heather —How it comes back!—to their wedding that day. Our getting there brought our neighbours and all, O! Till, two and two, the couples stood ready. And her father said: “Souls, for God's sake, be steady!” And we strung up our fiddles, and sounded out “A.” The groomsman he stared, and said, “You must follow!” But we'd gone to fiddle in front of the party, (Our feelings as friends being true and hearty) And fiddle in front we did—all the way. Yes, from their door by Mill-tail-Shallow, And up Styles-Lane, and by Front-Street houses, Where stood maids, bachelors, and spouses, Who cheered the songs that we knew how to play. I bowed the treble before her father, Michael the tenor in front of the lady, The bass-viol Reub—and right well played he!— The serpent Jim; ay, to church and back. I thought the bridegroom was flurried rather, As we kept up the tune outside the chancel, While they were swearing things none can cancel Inside the walls to our drumstick's whack. “Too gay!” she pleaded. “Clouds may gather, And sorrow come.” But she gave in, laughing, And by supper-time when we'd got to the quaffing Her fears were forgot, and her smiles weren't slack. A grand wedding 'twas! And what would follow We never thought. Or that we should have buried her On the same day with the man that married her, A day like the first, half hazy, half clear. Yes: little fogs were in every hollow, Though the purple hillocks enjoyed fine weather, When we went to play 'em to church together, And carried 'em there in an after year. FIRST OR LAST (SONG) If grief come early Joy comes late, If joy come early Grief will wait; Aye, my dear and tender! Wise ones joy them early While the cheeks are red, Banish grief till surly Time has dulled their dread. And joy being ours Ere youth has flown, The later hours May find us gone; Aye, my dear and tender! LONELY DAYS Lonely her fate was, Environed from sight In the house where the gate was Past finding at night. None there to share it, No one to tell: Long she'd to bear it, And bore it well. Elsewhere just so she Spent many a day; Wishing to go she Continued to stay. And people without Basked warm in the air, But none sought her out, Or knew she was there. Even birthdays were passed so, Sunny and shady: Years did it last so For this sad lady. Never declaring it, No one to tell, Still she kept bearing it— Bore it well. The days grew chillier, And then she went To a city, familiar In years forespent, When she walked gaily Far to and fro, But now, moving frailly, Could nowhere go. The cheerful colour Of houses she'd known Had died to a duller And dingier tone. Streets were now noisy Where once had rolled A few quiet coaches, Or citizens strolled. Through the party-wall Of the memoried spot They danced at a ball Who recalled her not. Tramlines lay crossing Once gravelled slopes, Metal rods clanked, And electric ropes. So she endured it all, Thin, thinner wrought, Until time cured it all, And she knew nought. Versified from a Diary. “WHAT DID IT MEAN?” What did it mean that noontide, when You bade me pluck the flower Within the other woman's bower, Whom I knew nought of then? I thought the flower blushed deeplier—aye, And as I drew its stalk to me It seemed to breathe: “I am, I see, Made use of in a human play.” And while I plucked, upstarted sheer As phantom from the pane thereby A corpse-like countenance, with eye That iced me by its baleful peer— Silent, as from a bier. . . . When I came back your face had changed, It was no face for me; O did it speak of hearts estranged, And deadly rivalry In times before I darked your door, To seise me of Mere second love, Which still the haunting first deranged? AT THE DINNER-TABLE I sat at dinner in my prime, And glimpsed my face in the sideboard-glass, And started as if I had seen a crime, And prayed the ghastly show might pass. Wrenched wrinkled features met my sight, Grinning back to me as my own; I well-nigh fainted with affright At finding me a haggard crone. My husband laughed. He had slily set A warping mirror there, in whim To startle me. My eyes grew wet; I spoke not all the eve to him. He was sorry, he said, for what he had done, And took away the distorting glass, Uncovering the accustomed one; And so it ended? No, alas, Fifty years later, when he died, I sat me in the selfsame chair, Thinking of him. Till, weary-eyed, I saw the sideboard facing there; And from its mirror looked the lean Thing I'd become, each wrinkle and score The image of me that I had seen In jest there fifty years before. THE MARBLE TABLET There it stands, though alas, what a little of her Shows in its cold white look! Not her glance, glide, or smile; not a tittle of her Voice like the purl of a brook; Not her thoughts, that you read like a book. It may stand for her once in November When first she breathed, witless of all; Or in heavy years she would remember When circumstance held her in thrall; Or at last, when she answered her call! Nothing more. The still marble, date-graven, Gives all that it can, tersely lined; That one has at length found the haven Which every one other will find; With silence on what shone behind. St. Juliot: September 8, 1916. THE MASTER AND THE LEAVES I We are budding, Master, budding, We of your favourite tree; March drought and April flooding Arouse us merrily, Our stemlets newly studding; And yet you do not see! II We are fully woven for summer In stuff of limpest green, The twitterer and the hummer Here rest of nights, unseen, While like a long-roll drummer The nightjar thrills the treen. III We are turning yellow, Master, And next we are turning red, And faster then and faster Shall seek our rooty bed, All wasted in disaster! But you lift not your head. IV —“I mark your early going, And that you'll soon be clay, I have seen your summer showing As in my youthful day; But why I seem unknowing Is too sunk in to say!” 1917. LAST WORDS TO A DUMB FRIEND Pet was never mourned as you, Purrer of the spotless hue, Plumy tail, and wistful gaze While you humoured our queer ways, Or outshrilled your morning call Up the stairs and through the hall— Foot suspended in its fall— While, expectant, you would stand Arched, to meet the stroking hand; Till your way you chose to wend Yonder, to your tragic end. Never another pet for me! Let your place all vacant be; Better blankness day by day Than companion torn away. Better bid his memory fade, Better blot each mark he made, Selfishly escape distress By contrived forgetfulness, Than preserve his prints to make Every morn and eve an ache. From the chair whereon he sat Sweep his fur, nor wince thereat; Rake his little pathways out Mid the bushes roundabout; Smooth away his talons' mark From the claw-worn pine-tree bark, Where he climbed as dusk embrowned, Waiting us who loitered round. Strange it is this speechless thing, Subject to our mastering, Subject for his life and food To our gift, and time, and mood; Timid pensioner of us Powers, His existence ruled by ours, Should—by crossing at a breath Into safe and shielded death, By the merely taking hence Of his insignificance— Loom as largened to the sense, Shape as part, above man's will, Of the Imperturbable. As a prisoner, flight debarred, Exercising in a yard, Still retain I, troubled, shaken, Mean estate, by him forsaken; And this home, which scarcely took Impress from his little look, By his faring to the Dim Grows all eloquent of him. Housemate, I can think you still Bounding to the window-sill, Over which I vaguely see Your small mound beneath the tree, Showing in the autumn shade That you moulder where you played. October 2, 1904. A DRIZZLING EASTER MORNING And he is risen? Well, be it so. . . . And still the pensive lands complain, And dead men wait as long ago, As if, much doubting, they would know What they are ransomed from, before They pass again their sheltering door. I stand amid them in the rain, While blusters vex the yew and vane; And on the road the weary wain Plods forward, laden heavily; And toilers with their aches are fain For endless rest—though risen is he. ON ONE WHO LIVED AND DIED WHERE HE WAS BORN When a night in November Blew forth its bleared airs An infant descended His birth-chamber stairs For the very first time, At the still, midnight chime; All unapprehended His mission, his aim.— Thus, first, one November, An infant descended The stairs. On a night in November Of weariful cares, A frail aged figure Ascended those stairs For the very last time: All gone his life's prime, All vanished his vigour, And fine, forceful frame: Thus, last, one November Ascended that figure Upstairs. On those nights in November— Apart eighty years— The babe and the bent one Who traversed those stairs From the early first time To the last feeble climb— That fresh and that spent one— Were even the same: Yea, who passed in November As infant, as bent one, Those stairs. Wise child of November! From birth to blanched hairs Descending, ascending, Wealth-wantless, those stairs; Who saw quick in time As a vain pantomime Life's tending, its ending, The worth of its fame. Wise child of November, Descending, ascending Those stairs! THE SECOND NIGHT (BALLAD) I missed one night, but the next I went; It was gusty above, and clear; She was there, with the look of one ill-content, And said: “Do not come near!” —“I am sorry last night to have failed you here, And now I have travelled all day; And it's long rowing back to the West-Hoe Pier, So brief must be my stay.” —“O man of mystery, why not say Out plain to me all you mean? Why you missed last night, and must now away Is—another has come between!” —“O woman so mocking in mood and mien, So be it!” I replied: “And if I am due at a differing scene Before the dark has died, “'Tis that, unresting, to wander wide Has ever been my plight, And at least I have met you at Cremyll side If not last eve, to-night.” —“You get small rest—that read I quite; And so do I, maybe; Though there's a rest hid safe from sight Elsewhere awaiting me!” A mad star crossed the sky to the sea, Wasting in sparks as it streamed, And when I looked back at her wistfully She had changed, much changed, it seemed. The sparks of the star in her pupils gleamed, She was vague as a vapour now, And ere of its meaning I had dreamed She'd vanished—I knew not how. I stood on, long; each cliff-top bough, Like a cynic nodding there, Moved up and down, though no man's brow But mine met the wayward air. Still stood I, wholly unaware Of what had come to pass, Or had brought the secret of my new Fair To my old Love, alas! I went down then by crag and grass To the boat wherein I had come. Said the man with the oars: “This news of the lass Of Edgcumbe, is sharp for some! “Yes: found this daybreak, stiff and numb On the shore here, whither she'd sped To meet her lover last night in the glum, And he came not, 'tis said. “And she leapt down, heart-hit. Pity she's dead: So much for the faithful-bent!” . . . I looked, and again a star overhead Shot through the firmament. SHE WHO SAW NOT “Did you see something within the house That made me call you before the red sunsetting? Something that all this common scene endows With a richened impress there can be no forgetting?” “—I have found nothing to see therein, O Sage, that should have made you urge me to enter, Nothing to fire the soul, or the sense to win: I rate you as a rare misrepresenter!” “—Go anew, Lady,—in by the right. . . . Well: why does your face not shine like the face of Moses?” “—I found no moving thing there save the light And shadow flung on the wall by the outside roses.” “—Go yet once more, pray. Look on a seat.” “—I go. . . . O Sage, it's only a man that sits there With eyes on the sun. Mute,—average head to feet.” “—No more?”—“No more. Just one the place befits there, “As the rays reach in through the open door, And he looks at his hand, and the sun glows through his fingers, While he's thinking thoughts whose tenour is no more To me than the swaying rose-tree shade that lingers.” No more. And years drew on and on Till no sun came, dank fogs the house enfolding; And she saw inside, when the form in the flesh had gone, As a vision what she had missed when the real beholding. THE OLD WORKMAN “Why are you so bent down before your time, Old mason? Many have not left their prime So far behind at your age, and can still Stand full upright at will.” He pointed to the mansion-front hard by, And to the stones of the quoin against the sky; “Those upper blocks,” he said, “that there you see, It was that ruined me.” There stood in the air up to the parapet Crowning the corner height, the stones as set By him—ashlar whereon the gales might drum For centuries to come. “I carried them up,” he said, “by a ladder there; The last was as big a load as I could bear; But on I heaved; and something in my back Moved, as 'twere with a crack. “So I got crookt. I never lost that sprain; And those who live there, walled from wind and rain By freestone that I lifted, do not know That my life's ache came so. “They don't know me, or even know my name, But good I think it, somehow, all the same To have kept 'em safe from harm, and right and tight, Though it has broke me quite. ‘Yes; that I fixed it firm up there I am proud, Facing the hail and snow and sun and cloud, And to stand storms for ages, beating round When I lie underground.” THE SAILOR'S MOTHER “O whence do you come, Figure in the night-fog that chills me numb?” “I come to you across from my house up there, And I don't mind the brine-mist clinging to me That blows from the quay, For I heard him in my chamber, and thought you unaware. “But what did you hear, That brought you blindly knocking in this middle-watch so drear?” “My sailor son's voice as 'twere calling at your door, And I don't mind my bare feet clammy on the stones, And the blight to my bones, For he only knows of this house I lived in before.” “Nobody's nigh, Woman like a skeleton, with socket-sunk eye.” “Ah—nobody's nigh! And my life is drearisome, And this is the old home we loved in many a day Before he went away; And the salt fog mops me. And nobody's come!” From “To Please his Wife.” OUTSIDE THE CASEMENT (A REMINISCENCE OF THE WAR) We sat in the room And praised her whom We saw in the portico-shade outside: She could not hear What was said of her, But smiled, for its purport we did not hide. Then in was brought That message, fraught With evil fortune for her out there, Whom we loved that day More than any could say, And would fain have fenced from a waft of care. And the question pressed Like lead on each breast, Should we cloak the tidings, or call her and tell? It was too intense A choice for our sense, As we pondered and watched her we loved so well. Yea, spirit failed us At what assailed us; How long, while seeing what soon must come, Should we counterfeit No knowledge of it, And stay the stroke that would blanch and numb? And thus, before For evermore Joy left her, we practised to beguile Her innocence when She now and again Looked in, and smiled us another smile. THE PASSER-BY (L. H. RECALLS HER ROMANCE) He used to pass, well-trimmed and brushed, My window every day, And when I smiled on him he blushed, That youth, quite as a girl might; aye, In the shyest way. Thus often did he pass hereby, That youth of bounding gait, Until the one who blushed was I, And he became, as here I sate, My joy, my fate. And now he passes by no more, That youth I loved too true! I grieve should he, as here of yore, Pass elsewhere, seated in his view, Some maiden new! If such should be, alas for her! He'll make her feel him dear, Become her daily comforter, Then tire him of her beauteous gear, And disappear! “I WAS THE MIDMOST” I was the midmost of my world When first I frisked me free, For though within its circuit gleamed But a small company, And I was immature, they seemed To bend their looks on me. She was the midmost of my world When I went further forth, And hence it was that, whether I turned To south, east, west, or north, Beams of an all-day Polestar burned From that new axe of earth. Where now is midmost in my world? I trace it not at all: No midmost shows it here, or there, When wistful voices call “We are fain! We are fain!” from everywhere On Earth's bewildering ball! A SOUND IN THE NIGHT (WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17??) “What do I catch upon the night-wind, husband?— What is it sounds in this house so eerily? It seems to be a woman's voice: each little while I hear it, And it much troubles me!” “'Tis but the eaves dripping down upon the plinth-slopes: Letting fancies worry thee!—sure 'tis a foolish thing, When we were on'y coupled half an hour before the noontide, And now it's but evening.” “Yet seems it still a woman's voice outside the castle, husband, And 'tis cold to-night, and rain beats, and this is a lonely place. Didst thou fathom much of womankind in travel or adventure Ere ever thou sawest my face?” “It may be a tree, bride, that rubs his arms acrosswise, If it is not the eaves-drip upon the lower slopes, Or the river at the bend, where it whirls about the hatches Like a creature that sighs and mopes.” “Yet it still seems to me like the crying of a woman, And it saddens me much that so piteous a sound On this my bridal night when I would get agone from sorrow Should so ghost-like wander round!” “To satisfy thee, Love, I will strike the flint-and-steel, then, And set the rush-candle up, and undo the door, And take the new horn-lantern that we bought upon our journey, And throw the light over the moor.” He struck a light, and breeched and booted in the further chamber, And lit the new horn-lantern and went from her sight, And vanished down the turret; and she heard him pass the postern, And go out into the night. She listened as she lay, till she heard his step returning, And his voice as he unclothed him: “'Twas nothing, as I said, But the nor'-west wind a-blowing from the moor ath'art the river, And the tree that taps the gurgoyle-head.” “Nay, husband, you perplex me; for if the noise I heard here, Awaking me from sleep so, were but as you avow, The rain-fall, and the wind, and the tree-bough, and the river, Why is it silent now? “And why is thy hand and thy clasping arm so shaking, And thy sleeve and tags of hair so muddy and so wet, And why feel I thy heart a-thumping every time thou kissest me, And thy breath as if hard to get?” He lay there in silence for a while, still quickly breathing, Then started up and walked about the room resentfully: “O woman, witch, whom I, in sooth, against my will have wedded, Why castedst thou thy spells on me? There was one I loved once: the cry you heard was her cry: She came to me to-night, and her plight was passing sore, As no woman. . . . Yea, and it was e'en the cry you heard, wife, But she will cry no more! “And now I can't abide thee: this place, it hath a curse on't, This farmstead once a castle: I'll get me straight away!” He dressed this time in darkness, unspeaking, as she listened, And went ere the dawn turned day. They found a woman's body at a spot called Rocky Shallow, Where the Froom stream curves amid the moorland, washed aground, And they searched about for him, the yeoman, who had darkly known her, But he could not be found. And the bride left for good-and-all the farmstead once a castle, And in a county far away lives, mourns, and sleeps alone, And thinks in windy weather that she hears a woman crying, And sometimes an infant's moan. ON A DISCOVERED CURL OF HAIR When your soft welcomings were said, This curl was waving on your head, And when we walked where breakers dinned It sported in the sun and wind, And when I had won your words of grace It brushed and clung about my face. Then, to abate the misery Of absentness, you gave it me. Where are its fellows now? Ah, they For brightest brown have donned a gray, And gone into a caverned ark, Ever unopened, always dark! Yet this one curl, untouched of time, Beams with live brown as in its prime, So that it seems I even could now Restore it to the living brow By bearing down the western road Till I had reached your old abode. February 1913. AN OLD LIKENESS (RECALLING R. T.) Who would have thought That, not having missed he Talks, tears, laughter In absence, or sought To recall for so long Her gamut of song; Or ever to waft her Signal of aught That she, fancy-fanned, Would well understand, I should have kissed her Picture when scanned Yawning years after! Yet, seeing her poor Dim-outlined form Chancewise at night-time, Some old allure Came on me, warm, Fresh, pleadful, pure, As in that bright time At a far season Of love and unreason, And took me by storm Here in this blight-time! And thus it arose That, yawning years after Our early flows Of wit and laughter, And framing of rhymes At idle times, At sight of her painting, Though she lies cold In churchyard mould, I took its feinting As real, and kissed it, As if I had wist it Herself of old. HER APOTHEOSIS (FADED WOMAN'S SONG) “Secretum meum mihi” There were years vague of measure Needless the asking when; No honours, praises, pleasure Reached common maids from men. And hence no lures bewitched them, No hand was stretched to raise, No gracious gifts enriched them, No voices sang their praise. Yet an iris at that season Amid the accustomed slight From denseness, dull unreason, Ringed me with living light. “SACRED TO THE MEMORY” (MARY H.) That “Sacred to the Memory” Is clearly carven there I own, And all may think that on the stone The words have been inscribed by me In bare conventionality. They know not and will never know That my full script is not confined To that stone space, but stands deep lined Upon the landscape high and low Wherein she made such worthy show. TO A WELL-NAMED DWELLING Glad old house of lichened stonework, What I owed you in my lone work, Noon and night! Whensoever faint or ailing, Letting go my grasp and failing, You lent light. How by that fair title came you? Did some forward eye so name you Knowing that one, Stumbling down his century blindly, Would remark your sound, so kindly, And be won? Smile in sunlight, sleep in moonlight, Bask in April, May, and June-light, Zephyr-fanned; Let your chambers show no sorrow, Blanching day, or stuporing morrow, While they stand. THE WHIPPER-IN “My father was the whipper-in,— Is still—if I'm not misled? And now I see, where the hedge is thin, A little spot of red; Surely it is my father Going to the kennel-shed! “I cursed and fought my father—aye, And sailed to a foreign land; And feeling sorry, I'm back, to stay, Please God, as his helping hand. Surely it is my father Near where the kennels stand?” “—True. Whipper-in he used to be For twenty years or more; And you did go away to sea As youths have done before. Yes, oddly enough that red there Is the very coat he wore. “But he—he's dead; was thrown somehow, And gave his back a crick, And though that is his coat, 'tis now The scarecrow of a rick; You'll see when you get nearer— 'Tis spread out on a stick. “You see, when all had settled down Your mother's things were sold, And she went back to her own town, And the coat, ate out with mould, Is now used by the farmer For scaring, as 'tis old.” A MILITARY APPOINTMENT (SCHERZANDO) “So back you have come from the town, Nan, dear! And have you seen him there, or near— That soldier of mine— Who long since promised to meet me here?” “—O yes, Nell: from the town I come, And have seen your lover on sick-leave home— That soldier of yours— Who swore to meet you, or Strike-him-dumb; “But has kept himself of late away; Yet,—in short, he's coming, I heard him say— That lover of yours— To this very spot on this very day.” “—Then I'll wait, I'll wait, through wet or dry! I'll give him a goblet brimming high— This lover of mine— And not of complaint one word or sigh!” “—Nell, him I have chanced so much to see, That—he has grown the lover of me!— That lover of yours— And it's here our meeting is planned to be.” THE MILESTONE BY THE RABBIT-BURROW (ON YELL'HAM HILL) In my loamy nook As I dig my hole I observe men look At a stone, and sigh As they pass it by To some far goal. Something it says To their glancing eyes That must distress The frail and lame, And the strong of frame Gladden or surprise. Do signs on its face Declare how far Feet have to trace Before they gain Some blest champaign Where no gins are? THE LAMENT OF THE LOOKING-GLASS Words from the mirror softly pass To the curtains with a sigh: “Why should I trouble again to glass These smileless things hard by, Since she I pleasured once, alas, Is now no longer nigh!” “I've imaged shadows of coursing cloud, And of the plying limb On the pensive pine when the air is loud With its aerial hymn; But never do they make me proud To catch them within my rim! “I flash back phantoms of the night That sometimes flit by me, I echo roses red and white— The loveliest blooms that be— But now I never hold to sight So sweet a flower as she.” CROSS-CURRENTS They parted—a pallid, trembling pair, And rushing down the lane He left her lonely near me there; —I asked her of their pain. “It is for ever,” at length she said, “His friends have schemed it so, That the long-purposed day to wed Never shall we two know.” “In such a cruel case,” said I, “Love will contrive a course?” “—Well, no . . . A thing may underlie, Which robs that of its force; “A thing I could not tell him of, Though all the year I have tried; This: never could I have given him love, Even had I been his bride. “So, when his kinsfolk stop the way Point-blank, there could not be A happening in the world to-day More opportune for me! “Yet hear—no doubt to your surprise— I am grieving, for his sake, That I have escaped the sacrifice I was distressed to make!” THE OLD NEIGHBOUR AND THE NEW 'Twas to greet the new rector I called here, But in the arm-chair I see My old friend, for long years installed here, Who palely nods to me. The new man explains what he's planning In a smart and cheerful tone, And I listen, the while that I'm scanning The figure behind his own. The newcomer urges things on me; I return a vague smile thereto, The olden face gazing upon me Just as it used to do! And on leaving I scarcely remember Which neighbour to-day I have seen, The one carried out in September, Or him who but entered yestreen. THE CHOSEN ????? ????? ????????????? “A woman for whom great gods might strive” I said, and kissed her there: And then I thought of the other five, And of how charms outwear. I thought of the first with her eating eyes, And I thought of the second with hers, green-gray And I thought of the third, experienced, wise, And I thought of the fourth who sang all day. And I thought of the fifth, whom I'd called a jade, And I thought of them all, tear-fraught; And that each had shown her a passable maid, Yet not of the favour sought. So I traced these words on the bark of a beech, Just at the falling of the mast: “After scanning five; yes, each and each, I've found the woman desired—at last!” “—I feel a strange benumbing spell, As one ill-wished!” said she. And soon it seemed that something fell Was starving her love for me. “I feel some curse. O, five were there?” And wanly she swerved, and went away. I followed sick: night numbed the air, And dark the mournful moorland lay. I cried: “O darling, turn your head!” But never her face I viewed; “O turn, O turn!” again I said, And miserably pursued. At length I came to a Christ-cross stone Which she had passed without discern; And I knelt upon the leaves there strown, And prayed aloud that she might turn. I rose, and looked; and turn she did; I cried, “My heart revives!” “Look more,” she said. I looked as bid; Her face was all the five's. All the five women, clear come back, I saw in her—with her made one, The while she drooped upon the track, And her frail term seemed well-nigh run. She'd half forgot me in her change; “Who are you? Won't you say Who you may be, you man so strange, Following since yesterday?” I took the composite form she was, And carried her to an arbour small, Not passion-moved, but even because In one I could atone to all. And there she lies, and there I tend, Till my life's threads unwind, A various womanhood in blend— Not one, but all combined. THE INSCRIPTION (A TALE) Sir John was entombed, and the crypt was closed, and she, Like a soul that could meet no more the sight of the sun, Inclined her in weepings and prayings continually, As his widowed one. And to pleasure her in her sorrow, and fix his name As a memory Time's fierce frost should never kill, She caused to be richly chased a brass to his fame, Which should link them still; For she bonded her name with his own on the brazen page, As if dead and interred there with him, and cold, and numb, (Omitting the day of her dying and year of her age Till her end should come;) And implored good people to pray “Of their Charytie For these twaine Soules,”—yea, she who did last remain Forgoing Heaven's bliss if ever with spouse should she Again have lain. Even there, as it first was set, you may see it now, Writ in quaint Church-text, with the date of her death left bare, In the aged Estminster aisle, where the folk yet bow Themselves in prayer. Thereafter some years slid, till there came a day When it slowly began to be marked of the standers-by That she would regard the brass, and would bend away With a drooping sigh. Now the lady was fair as any the eye might scan Through a summer day of roving—a type at whose lip Despite her maturing seasons, no meet man Would be loth to sip. And her heart was stirred with a lightning love to its pith For a newcomer who, while less in years, was one Full eager and able to make her his own forthwith, Restrained of none. But she answered Nay, death-white; and still as he urged She adversely spake, overmuch as she loved the while, Till he pressed for why, and she led with the face of one scourged To the neighbouring aisle, And showed him the words, ever gleaming upon her pew, Memorizing her there as the knight's eternal wife, Or falsing such, debarred inheritance due Of celestial life. He blenched, and reproached her that one yet undeceased Should bury her future—that future which none can spell; And she wept, and purposed anon to inquire of the priest If the price were hell Of her wedding in face of the record. Her lover agreed, And they parted before the brass with a shudderful kiss, For it seemed to flash out on their impulse of passionate need, “Mock ye not this!” Well, the priest, whom more perceptions moved than one, Said she erred at the first to have written as if she were dead Her name and adjuration; but since it was done Nought could be said Save that she must abide by the pledge, for the peace of her soul And so, by her life, maintain the apostrophe good, If she wished anon to reach the coveted goal Of beatitude. To erase from the consecrate text her prayer as there prayed Would aver that, since earth's joys most drew her, past doubt, Friends' prayers for her joy above by Jesu's aid Could be done without. Moreover she thought of the laughter, the shrug, the jibe That would rise at her back in the nave when she should pass As another's avowed by the words she had chosen to inscribe On the changeless brass. And so for months she replied to her Love: “No, no”; While sorrow was gnawing her beauties ever and more, Till he, long-suffering and weary, grew to show Less warmth than before. And, after an absence, wrote words absolute: That he gave her till Midsummer morn to make her mind clear; And that if, by then, she had not said Yea to his suit, He should wed elsewhere. Thence on, at unwonted times through the lengthening days She was seen in the church—at dawn, or when the sun dipt And the moon rose, standing with hands joined, blank of gaze, Before the script. She thinned as he came not; shrank like a creature that cowers As summer drew nearer; but yet had not promised to wed, When, just at the zenith of June, in the still night hours, She was missed from her bed. “The church!” they whispered with qualms; “where often she sits.” They found her: facing the brass there, else seeing none, But feeling the words with her finger, gibbering in fits; And she knew them not one. And so she remained, in her handmaids' charge; late, soon, Tracing words in the air with her finger, as seen that night— Those incised on the brass—till at length unwatched one noon, She vanished from sight. And, as talebearers tell, thence on to her last-taken breath Was unseen, save as wraith that in front of the brass made moan; So that ever the way of her life and the time of her death Remained unknown. And hence, as indited above, you may read even now The quaint Church-text, with the date of her death left bare, In the aged Estminster aisle, where folk yet bow Themselves in prayer. October 30, 1907. THE MARBLE-STREETED TOWN I reach the marble-streeted town, Whose “Sound” outbreathes its air Of sharp sea-salts; I see the movement up and down As when she was there. Ships of all countries come and go, The bandsmen boom in the sun A throbbing waltz; The schoolgirls laugh along the Hoe As when she was one. I move away as the music rolls: The place seems not to mind That she—of old The brightest of its native souls— Left it behind! Over this green aforedays she On light treads went and came. Yea, times untold; Yet none here knows her history— Has heard her name. Plymouth (1914?). A WOMAN DRIVING How she held up the horses' heads, Firm-lipped, with steady rein, Down that grim steep the coastguard treads, Till all was safe again! With form erect and keen contour She passed against the sea, And, dipping into the chine's obscure, Was seen no more by me. To others she appeared anew At times of dusky light, But always, so they told, withdrew From close and curious sight. Some said her silent wheels would roll Rutless on softest loam, And even that her steeds' footfall Sank not upon the foam. Where drives she now? It may be where No mortal horses are, But in a chariot of the air Towards some radiant star. A WOMAN'S TRUST If he should live a thousand years He'd find it not again That scorn of him by men Could less disturb a woman's trust In him as a steadfast star which must Rise scathless from the nether spheres: If he should live a thousand years He'd find it not again. She waited like a little child, Unchilled by damps of doubt, While from her eyes looked out A confidence sublime as Spring's When stressed by Winter's loiterings. Thus, howsoever the wicked wiled, She waited like a little child Unchilled by damps of doubt. Through cruel years and crueller Thus she believed in him And his aurore, so dim; That, after fenweeds, flowers would blow; And above all things did she show Her faith in his good faith with her; Through cruel years and crueller Thus she believed in him! BEST TIMES We went a day's excursion to the stream, Basked by the bank, and bent to the ripple-gleam, And I did not know That life would show, However it might flower, no finer glow. I walked in the Sunday sunshine by the road That wound towards the wicket of your abode, And I did not think That life would shrink To nothing ere it shed a rosier pink. Unlooked for I arrived on a rainy night, And you hailed me at the door by the swaying light And I full forgot That life might not Again be touching that ecstatic height. And that calm eve when you walked up the stair, After a gaiety prolonged and rare, No thought soever That you might never Walk down again, struck me as I stood there. Rewritten from an old draft. THE CASUAL ACQUAINTANCE While he was here with breath and bone, To speak to and to see, Would I had known—more clearly known— What that man did for me When the wind scraped a minor lay, And the spent west from white To gray turned tiredly, and from gray To broadest bands of night! But I saw not, and he saw not What shining life-tides flowed To me-ward from his casual jot Of service on that road. He would have said: “'Twas nothing new; We all do what we can; 'Twas only what one man would do For any other man.” Now that I gauge his goodliness He's slipped from human eyes; And when he passed there's none can guess, Or point out where he lies. INTRA SEPULCHRUM What curious things we said, What curious things we did Up there in the world we walked till dead, Our kith and kin amid! How we played at love, And its wildness, weakness, woe; Yes, played thereat far more than enough As it turned out, I trow! Played at believing in gods And observing the ordinances, I for your sake in impossible codes Right ready to acquiesce. Thinking our lives unique, Quite quainter than usual kinds, We held that we could not abide a week The tether of typic minds. —Yet people who day by day Pass by and look at us From over the wall in a casual way Are of this unconscious. And feel, if anything, That none can be buried here Removed from commonest fashioning, Or lending note to a bier: No twain who in heart-heaves proved Themselves at all adept, Who more than many laughed and loved Who more than many wept, Or were as sprites or elves Into blind matter hurled, Or ever could have been to themselves The centre of the world. THE WHITEWASHED WALL Why does she turn in that shy soft way Whenever she stirs the fire, And kiss to the chimney-corner wall, As if entranced to admire Its whitewashed bareness more than the sight Of a rose in richest green? I have known her long, but this raptured rite I never before have seen. —Well, once when her son cast his shadow there, A friend took a pencil and drew him Upon that flame-lit wall. And the lines Had a lifelike semblance to him. And there long stayed his familiar look; But one day, ere she knew, The whitener came to cleanse the nook, And covered the face from view. “Yes,” he said: “My brush goes on with a rush, And the draught is buried under; When you have to whiten old cots and brighten, What else can you do, I wonder?” But she knows he's there. And when she yearns For him, deep in the labouring night, She sees him as close at hand, and turns To him under his sheet of white. JUST THE SAME I sat. It all was past; Hope never would hail again; Fair days had ceased at a blast, The world was a darkened den. The beauty and dream were gone, And the halo in which I had hied So gaily gallantly on Had suffered blot and died! I went forth, heedless whither, In a cloud too black for name: —People frisked hither and thither; The world was just the same. THE LAST TIME The kiss had been given and taken, And gathered to many past: It never could reawaken; But I heard none say: “It's the last!” The clock showed the hour and the minute But I did not turn and look: I read no finis in it, As at closing of a book. But I read it all too rightly When, at a time anon, A figure lay stretched out whitely, And I stood looking thereon. THE SEVEN TIMES The dark was thick. A boy he seemed at that time Who trotted by me with uncertain air; “I'll tell my tale,” he murmured, “for I fancy A friend goes there? . . .” Then thus he told. “I reached—'twas for the first time— A dwelling. Life was clogged in me with care; I thought not I should meet an eyesome maiden, But found one there. “I entered on the precincts for the second time— 'Twas an adventure fit and fresh and fair— I slackened in my footsteps at the porchway, And found her there. “I rose and travelled thither for the third time, The hope-hues growing gayer and yet gayer As I hastened round the boscage of the outskirts, And found her there. “I journeyed to the place again the fourth time (The best and rarest visit of the rare, As it seemed to me, engrossed about these goings), And found her there. “When I bent me to my pilgrimage the fifth time (Soft-thinking as I journeyed I would dare A certain word at token of good auspice), I found her there. “That landscape did I traverse for the sixth time, And dreamed on what we purposed to prepare; I reached a tryst before my journey's end came, And found her there. “I went again—long after—aye, the seventh time; The look of things was sinister and bare As I caught no customed signal, heard no voice call, Nor found her there. “And now I gad the globe—day, night, and any time, To light upon her hiding unaware, And, maybe, I shall nigh me to some nymph-niche, And find her there!” “But how,” said I, “has your so little lifetime Given roomage for such loving, loss, despair? A boy so young!” Forthwith I turned my lantern Upon him there. His head was white. His small form, fine aforetime, Was shrunken with old age and battering wear, An eighty-years long plodder saw I pacing Beside me there. THE SUN'S LAST LOOK ON THE COUNTRY GIRL (M. H.) The sun threw down a radiant spot On the face in the winding-sheet— The face it had lit when a babe's in its cot; And the sun knew not, and the face knew not That soon they would no more meet. Now that the grave has shut its door, And lets not in one ray, Do they wonder that they meet no more— That face and its beaming visitor— That met so many a day? December 1915. IN A LONDON FLAT I “You look like a widower,” she said Through the folding-doors with a laugh from the bed, As he sat by the fire in the outer room, Reading late on a night of gloom, And a cab-hack's wheeze, and the clap of its feet In its breathless pace on the smooth wet street, Were all that came to them now and then. . . . “You really do!” she quizzed again. II And the Spirits behind the curtains heard, And also laughed, amused at her word, And at her light-hearted view of him. “Let's get him made so—just for a whim!” Said the Phantom Ironic. “'Twould serve her right If we coaxed the Will to do it some night.” “O pray not!” pleaded the younger one, The Sprite of the Pities. “She said it in fun!” III But so it befell, whatever the cause, That what she had called him he next year was; And on such a night, when she lay elsewhere, He, watched by those Phantoms, again sat there, And gazed, as if gazing on far faint shores, At the empty bed through the folding-doors As he remembered her words; and wept That she had forgotten them where she slept. DRAWING DETAILS IN AN OLD CHURCH I hear the bell-rope sawing, And the oil-less axle grind, As I sit alone here drawing What some Gothic brain designed; And I catch the toll that follows From the lagging bell, Ere it spreads to hills and hollows Where people dwell. I ask not whom it tolls for, Incurious who he be; So, some morrow, when those knolls for One unguessed, sound out for me, A stranger, loitering under In nave or choir, May think, too, “Whose, I wonder?” But not inquire. RAKE-HELL MUSES Yes; since she knows not need, Nor walks in blindness, I may without unkindness This true thing tell: Which would be truth, indeed, Though worse in speaking, Were her poor footsteps seeking A pauper's cell. I judge, then, better far She now have sorrow, Than gladness that to-morrow Might know its knell.— It may be men there are Could make of union A lifelong sweet communion Or passioned spell; But I, to save her name And bring salvation By altar-affirmation And bridal bell; I, by whose rash unshame These tears come to her:— My faith would more undo her Than my farewell! Chained to me, year by year My moody madness Would make her olden gladness An intermell. She'll take the ill that's near, And bear the blaming. 'Twill pass. Full soon her shaming They'll cease to yell. Our unborn, first her moan, Will grow her guerdon, Until from blot and burden A joyance swell; In that therein she'll own My good part wholly, My evil staining solely My own vile fell. Of the disgrace, may be “He shunned to share it, Being false,” they'll say. I'll bear it; Time will dispel The calumny, and prove This much about me, That she lives best without me Who would live well. That, this once, not self-love But good intention Pleads that against convention We two rebel. For, is one moonlight dance, One midnight passion, A rock whereon to fashion Life's citadel? Prove they their power to prance Life's miles together From upper slope to nether Who trip an ell? —Years hence, or now apace, May tongues be calling News of my further falling Sinward pell-mell: Then this great good will grace Our lives' division, She's saved from more misprison Though I plumb hell. 189? THE COLOUR (The following lines are partly original, partly remembered from a Wessex folk-rhyme) “What shall I bring you? Please will white do Best for your wearing The long day through?” “—White is for weddings, Weddings, weddings, White is for weddings, And that won't do.” “What shall I bring you? Please will red do Best for your wearing The long day through?” “—Red is for soldiers, Soldiers, soldiers, Red is for soldiers, And that won't do.” “What shall I bring you? Please will blue do Best for your wearing The long day through?’ “—Blue is for sailors, Sailors, sailors, Blue is for sailors, And that won't do.” “What shall I bring you? Please will green do Best for your wearing The long day through’” “—Green is for mayings Mayings, mayings, Green is for mayings, And that won't do.” “What shall I bring you Then? Will black do Best for your wearing The long day through?” “—Black is for mourning, Mourning, mourning, Black is for mourning, And black will do.” MURMURS IN THE GLOOM (NOCTURNE) I wayfared at the nadir of the sun Where populations meet, though seen of none; And millions seemed to sigh around As though their haunts were nigh around, And unknown throngs to cry around Of things late done. “O Seers, who well might high ensample show” (Came throbbing past in plainsong small and slow), “Leaders who lead us aimlessly, Teachers who train us shamelessly, Why let ye smoulder flamelessly The truths ye trow? “Ye scribes, that urge the old medicament, Whose fusty vials have long dried impotent, Why prop ye meretricious things, Denounce the sane as vicious things, And call outworn factitious things Expedient? “O Dynasties that sway and shake us so, Why rank your magnanimities so low That grace can smooth no waters yet, But breathing threats and slaughters yet Ye grieve Earth's sons and daughters yet As long ago? “Live there no heedful ones of searching sight, Whose accents might be oracles that smite To hinder those who frowardly Conduct us, and untowardly; To lead the nations vawardly From gloom to light?” September 22, 1899. EPITAPH I never cared for Life: Life cared for me, And hence I owed it some fidelity. It now says, “Cease; at length thou hast learnt to grind Sufficient toll for an unwilling mind, And I dismiss thee—not without regard That thou didst ask no ill-advised reward, Nor sought in me much more than thou couldst find.” AN ANCIENT TO ANCIENTS Where once we danced, where once we sang, Gentlemen, The floors are sunken, cobwebs hang, And cracks creep; worms have fed upon The doors. Yea, sprightlier times were then Than now, with harps and tabrets gone, Gentlemen! Where once we rowed, where once we sailed, Gentlemen, And damsels took the tiller, veiled Against too strong a stare (God wot Their fancy, then or anywhen!) Upon that shore we are clean forgot, Gentlemen! We have lost somewhat, afar and near, Gentlemen, The thinning of our ranks each year Affords a hint we are nigh undone, That we shall not be ever again The marked of many, loved of one, Gentlemen. In dance the polka hit our wish, Gentlemen, The paced quadrille, the spry schottische, “Sir Roger.”—And in opera spheres The “Girl” (the famed “Bohemian”), And “Trovatore,” held the ears, Gentlemen. This season's paintings do not please, Gentlemen, Like Etty, Mulready, Maclise; Throbbing romance has waned and wanned; No wizard wields the witching pen Of Bulwer, Scott, Dumas, and Sand, Gentlemen. The bower we shrined to Tennyson, Gentlemen, Is roof-wrecked; damps there drip upon Sagged seats, the creeper-nails are rust, The spider is sole denizen; Even she who voiced those rhymes is dust, Gentlemen! We who met sunrise sanguine-souled, Gentlemen, Are wearing weary. We are old; These younger press; we feel our rout Is imminent to Aïdes' den,— That evening shades are stretching out, Gentlemen! And yet, though ours be failing frames, Gentlemen, So were some others' history names, Who trode their track light-limbed and fast As these youth, and not alien From enterprise, to their long last, Gentlemen. Sophocles, Plato, Socrates, Gentlemen, Pythagoras, Thucydides, Herodotus, and Homer,—yea, Clement, Augustin, Origen, Burnt brightlier towards their setting-day, Gentlemen. And ye, red-lipped and smooth-browed; list, Gentlemen; Much is there waits you we have missed; Much lore we leave you worth the knowing, Much, much has lain outside our ken: Nay, rush not: time serves: we are going, Gentlemen. AFTER READING PSALMS XXXIX., XL., ETC. Simple was I and was young; Kept no gallant tryst, I; Even from good words held my tongue, Quoniam Tu fecisti! Through my youth I stirred me not, High adventure missed I, Left the shining shrines unsought; Yet—me deduxisti! At my start by Helicon Love-lore little wist I, Worldly less; but footed on; Why? Me suscepisti! When I failed at fervid rhymes, “Shall,” I said, “persist I?” “Dies” (I would add at times) “Meos posuisti!” So I have fared through many suns; Sadly little grist I Bring my mill, or any one's, Domine, Tu scisti! And at dead of night I call: “Though to prophets list I, Which hath understood at all? Yea: Quem elegisti?” 187? SURVIEW “Cogitavi vias meas” A cry from the green-grained sticks of the fire Made me gaze where it seemed to be: 'Twas my own voice talking therefrom to me On how I had walked when my sun was higher— My heart in its arrogancy. “You held not to whatsoever was true,” Said my own voice talking to me: “Whatsoever was just you were slack to see; Kept not things lovely and pure in view,” Said my own voice talking to me. “You slighted her that endureth all,” Said my own voice talking to me; “Vaunteth not, trusteth hopefully; That suffereth long and is kind withal,” Said my own voice talking to me. “You taught not that which you set about,” Said my own voice talking to me; “That the greatest of things is Charity. . . .” —And the sticks burnt low, and the fire went out, And my voice ceased talking to me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HUMAN SHOWS FAR PHANTASIES SONGS, AND TRIFLES WAITING BOTH A star looks down at me, And says: “Here I and you Stand, each in our degree: What do you mean to do,— Mean to do?” I say: “For all I know, Wait, and let Time go by, Till my change come.”—“Just so,” The star says: “So mean I:— So mean I.” A BIRD-SCENE AT A RURAL DWELLING When the inmate stirs, the birds retire discreetly From the window-ledge, whereon they whistled sweetly And on the step of the door, In the misty morning hoar; But now the dweller is up they flee To the crooked neighbouring codlin-tree; And when he comes fully forth they seek the garden, And call from the lofty costard, as pleading pardon For shouting so near before In their joy at being alive:— Meanwhile the hammering clock within goes five. I know a domicile of brown and green, Where for a hundred summers there have been Just such enactments, just such daybreaks seen. “ANY LITTLE OLD SONG” Any little old song Will do for me, Tell it of joys gone long, Or joys to be, Or friendly faces best Loved to see. Newest themes I want not On subtle strings, And for thrillings pant not That new song brings: I only need the homeliest Of heartstirrings. IN A FORMER RESORT AFTER MANY YEARS Do I know these, slack-shaped and wan, Whose substance, one time fresh and furrowless, Is now a rag drawn over a skeleton, As in El Greco's canvases?— Whose cheeks have slipped down, lips become indrawn, And statures shrunk to dwarfishness? Do they know me, whose former mind Was like an open plain where no foot falls, But now is as a gallery portrait-lined, And scored with necrologic scrawls, Where feeble voices rise, once full-defined, From underground in curious calls? A CATHEDRAL FAÇADE AT MIDNIGHT Along the sculptures of the western wall I watched the moonlight creeping: It moved as if it hardly moved at all Inch by inch thinly peeping Round on the pious figures of freestone, brought And poised there when the Universe was wrought To serve its centre, Earth, in mankind's thought. The lunar look skimmed scantly toe, breast, arm, Then edged on slowly, slightly, To shoulder, hand, face; till each austere form Was blanched its whole length brightly Of prophet, king, queen, cardinal in state, That dead men's tools had striven to simulate; And the stiff images stood irradiate. A frail moan from the martyred saints there set Mid others of the erection Against the breeze, seemed sighings of regret At the ancient faith's rejection Under the sure, unhasting, steady stress Of Reason's movement, making meaningless The coded creeds of old-time godliness. THE TURNIP-HOER Of tides that toss the souls of men Some are foreseen, and weathered warefully; More burst at flood, none witting why or when, And are called Destiny. —Years past there was a turnip-hoer, Who loved his wife and child, and worked amain In the turnip-time from dawn till day out-wore And night bedimmed the plain. The thronging plants of blueish green Would fall in lanes before his skilful blade, Which, as by sleight, would deftly slip between Those spared and those low-laid. 'Twas afternoon: he hoed his best, Unlifting head or eye, when, through the fence, He heard a gallop dropping from the crest Of the hill above him, whence, Descending at a crashing pace, An open carriage came, horsed by a pair: A lady sat therein, with lilywhite face And wildly windblown hair. The man sprang over, and horse and horse Faced in the highway as the pair ondrew; Like Terminus stood he there, and barred their course, And almost ere he knew The lady was limp within his arms, And, half-unconscious, clutched his hair and beard; And so he held her, till from neighbouring farms Came hinds, and soon appeared Footman and coachman on the way:— The steeds were guided back, now breath-bespent, And the hoer was rewarded with good pay:— So passed the accident. “She was the Duchess of Southernshire, They tell me,” said the second hoe, next day: “She's come a-visiting not far from here; This week will end her stay.” The hoer's wife that evening set Her hand to a crusted stew in the three-legged pot, And he sat looking on in silence; yet The cooking saw he not, But a woman, with her arms around him, Glove-handed, clasping his neck and clutching his blouse, And ere he went to bed that night he found him Outside a manor-house. A page there smoking answered him: “Her Grace's room is where you see that light; By now she's up there slipping off her trim: The Dook's is on the right.” She was, indeed, just saying through the door, “That dauntless fellow saved me from collapse: I'd not much with me, or 'd have given him more: 'Twas not enough, perhaps!” Up till she left, before he slept, He walked, though tired, to where her window shined, And mused till it went dark; but close he kept All that was in his mind. “What is it, Ike?” inquired his wife; “You are not so nice now as you used to be. What have I done? You seem quite tired of life!” “Nothing at all,” said he. In the next shire this lady of rank, So 'twas made known, would open a bazaar: He took his money from the savings-bank To go there, for 'twas far. And reached her stall, and sighted, clad In her ripe beauty and the goodliest guise, His Vision of late. He straight spent all he had, But not once caught her eyes. Next week he heard, with heart of clay, That London held her for three months or so: Fearing to tell his wife he went for a day, Pawning his watch to go; And scanned the Square of her abode, And timed her moves, as well as he could guess, That he might glimpse her; till afoot by road He came home penniless. . . . —The Duke in Wessex once again, Glanced at the Wessex paper, where he read Of a man, late taken to drink, killed by a train At a crossing, so it said. “Why—he who saved your life, I think?” —“O no,” said she. “It cannot be the same: He was sweet-breath'd, without a taint of drink; Yet it is like his name.” THE CARRIER There's a seat, I see, still empty?” Cried the hailer from the road; “No, there is not!” said the carrier, Quickening his horse and load. “—They say you are in the grave, Jane; But still you ride with me!” And he looked towards the vacant space He had kept beside his knee. And the passengers murmured: “'Tis where his wife In journeys to and fro Used always to sit; but nobody does Since those long years ago.” Rumble-mumble went the van Past Sidwell Church and wall, Till Exon Towers were out of scan, And night lay over all. LOVER TO MISTRESS (SONG) Beckon to me to come With handkerchief or hand, Or finger mere or thumb; Let forecasts be but rough, Parents more bleak than bland, 'Twill be enough, Maid mine, 'Twill be enough! Two fields, a wood, a tree, Nothing now more malign Lies between you and me; But were they bysm, or bluff, Or snarling sea, one sign Would be enough, Maid mine, Would be enough! From an old copy. THE MONUMENT-MAKER I chiselled her monument To my mind's content, Took it to the church by night, When her planet was at its height, And set it where I had figured the place in the daytime. Having niched it there I stepped back, cheered, and thought its outlines fair, And its marbles rare. Then laughed she over my shoulder as in our Maytime: “It spells not me!” she said: “Tells nothing about my beauty, wit, or gay time With all those, quick and dead, Of high or lowlihead, That hovered near, Including you, who carve there your devotion; But you felt none, my dear!” And then she vanished. Checkless sprang my emotion And forced a tear At seeing I'd not been truly known by her, And never prized!—that my memorial here, To consecrate her sepulchre, Was scorned, almost, By her sweet ghost: Yet I hoped not quite, in her very innermost! 1916. CIRCUS-RIDER TO RINGMASTER When I am riding round the ring no longer, Tell a tale of me; Say, no steed-borne woman's nerve was stronger Than used mine to be. Let your whole soul say it; do: O it will be true! Should I soon no more be mistress found in Feats I've made my own, Trace the tan-laid track you'd whip me round in On the cantering roan: There may cross your eyes again My lithe look as then. Show how I, when clay becomes my cover, Took the high-hoop leap Into your arms, who coaxed and grew my lover,— Ah, to make me weep Since those claspings cared for so Ever so long ago! Though not now as when you freshly knew me, But a fading form, Shape the kiss you'd briskly blow up to me While our love was warm, And my cheek unstained by tears, As in these last years! LAST WEEK IN OCTOBER The trees are undressing, and fling in many places— On the gray road, the roof, the window-sill— Their radiant robes and ribbons and yellow laces; A leaf each second so is flung at will, Here, there, another and another, still and still. A spider's web has caught one while downcoming, That stays there dangling when the rest pass on; Like a suspended criminal hangs he, mumming In golden garb, while one yet green, high yon, Trembles, as fearing such a fate for himself anon. COME NOT; YET COME! (SONG) In my sage moments I can say, Come not near, But far in foreign regions stay, So that here A mind may grow again serene and clear. But the thought withers. Why should I Have fear to earn me Fame from your nearness, though thereby Old fires new burn me, And lastly, maybe, tear and overturn me! So I say, Come: deign again shine Upon this place, Even if unslackened smart be mine From that sweet face, And I faint to a phantom past all trace. THE LATER AUTUMN Gone are the lovers, under the bush Stretched at their ease; Gone the bees, Tangling themselves in your hair as they rush On the line of your track, Leg-laden, back With a dip to their hive In a prepossessed dive. Toadsmeat is mangy, frosted, and sere; Apples in grass Crunch as we pass, And rot ere the men who make cyder appear. Couch-fires abound On fallows around, And shades far extend Like lives soon to end. Spinning leaves join the remains shrunk and brown Of last year's display That lie wasting away, On whose corpses they earlier as scorners gazed down From their aery green height: Now in the same plight They huddle; while yon A robin looks on. “LET ME BELIEVE” (SONG) Let me believe it, dearest, Let it be As just a dream—the merest— Haunting me, That a frank full-souled sweetness Warmed your smile And voice, to indiscreetness Once, awhile! And I will fondly ponder Till I lie Earthed up with others yonder Past a sigh, That you may name at stray times With regret One whom through green and gray times You forget! AT A FASHIONABLE DINNER We sat with the banqueting-party By the table-end— Unmarked,—no diners out Were we: scarce a friend Of our own mind's trend Was there, though the welcome was hearty. Then we noticed a shade extend By a distant screen, And I said: “What to you does it seem to mean, Lavine?” “—It is like my own body lying Beyond the door Where the servants glide in and about The carpeted floor; And it means my death hour!—” “—What a fancy! Who feels like dying While these smart sallies pour, With laughter between! To me it is more like satin sheen, Lavine.” “—That means your new bride, when you win her: Yes, so it must be! It's her satin dress, no doubt— That shine you see— My own corpse to me!” And a gloom came over the dinner, Where almost strangers were we, As the spirit of the scene Forsook her—the fairest of the whole thirteen— Lavine! GREEN SLATES (PENPETHY) It happened once, before the duller Loomings of life defined them, I searched for slates of greenish colour A quarry where men mined them; And saw, the while I peered around there, In the quarry standing A form against the slate background there, Of fairness eye-commanding. And now, though fifty years have flown me, With all their dreams and duties, And strange-pipped dice my hand has thrown me, And dust are all her beauties, Green slates—seen high on roofs, or lower In waggon, truck, or lorry— Cry out: “Our home was where you saw her Standing in the quarry!” AN EAST-END CURATE A small blind street off East Commercial Road; Window, door; window, door; Every house like the one before, Is where the curate, Mr. Dowle, has found a pinched abode. Spectacled, pale, moustache straw-coloured, and with a long thin face, Day or dark his lodgings' narrow doorstep does he pace. A bleached pianoforte, with its drawn silk plaitings faded, Stands in his room, its keys much yellowed, cyphering, and abraded, “Novello's Anthems” lie at hand, and also a few glees, And “Laws of Heaven for Earth” in a frame upon the wall one sees. He goes through his neighbours' houses as his own, and none regards, And opens their back-doors off-hand, to look for them in their yards: A man is threatening his wife on the other side of the wall, But the curate lets it pass as knowing the history of it all. Freely within his hearing the children skip and laugh and say: “There's Mister Dow-well! There's Mister Dow-well!” in their play; And the long, pallid, devoted face notes not, But stoops along abstractedly, for good, or in vain, God wot! AT RUSHY-POND On the frigid face of the heath-hemmed pond There shaped the half-grown moon: Winged whiffs from the north with a husky croon Blew over and beyond. And the wind flapped the moon in its float on the pool, And stretched it to oval form; Then corkscrewed it like a wriggling worm; Then wanned it weariful. And I cared not for conning the sky above Where hung the substant thing, For my thought was earthward sojourning On the scene I had vision of. Since there it was once, in a secret year, I had called a woman to me From across this water, ardently— And practised to keep her near; Till the last weak love-words had been said, And ended was her time, And blurred the bloomage of her prime, And white the earlier red. And the troubled orb in the pond's sad shine Was her very wraith, as scanned When she withdrew thence, mirrored, and Her days dropped out of mine. FOUR IN THE MORNING At four this day of June I rise: The dawn-light strengthens steadily; Earth is a cerule mystery, As if not far from Paradise At four o'clock, Or else near the Great Nebula, Or where the Pleiads blink and smile: (For though we see with eyes of guile The grisly grin of things by day, At four o'clock They show their best.) . . . In this vale's space I am up the first, I think. Yet, no, A whistling? and the to-and-fro Wheezed whettings of a scythe apace At four o'clock? . . . —Though pleasure spurred, I rose with irk: Here is one at compulsion's whip Taking his life's stern stewardship With blithe uncare, and hard at work At four o'clock! Bockhampton. ON THE ESPLANADE MIDSUMMER: 10 P.M. The broad bald moon edged up where the sea was wide, Mild, mellow-faced; Beneath, a tumbling twinkle of shines, like dyed, A trackway traced To the shore, as of petals fallen from a rose to waste, In its overblow, And fluttering afloat on inward heaves of the tide:— All this, so plain; yet the rest I did not know. The horizon gets lost in a mist new-wrought by the night: The lamps of the Bay That reach from behind me round to the left and right On the sea-wall way For a constant mile of curve, make a long display As a pearl-strung row, Under which in the waves they bore their gimlets of light:— All this was plain; but there was a thing not so. Inside a window, open, with undrawn blind, There plays and sings A lady unseen a melody undefined: And where the moon flings Its shimmer a vessel crosses, whereon to the strings Plucked sweetly and low Of a harp, they dance. Yea, such did I mark. That, behind, My Fate's masked face crept near me I did not know! IN ST. PAUL'S A WHILE AGO Summer and winter close commune On this July afternoon As I enter chilly Paul's, With its chasmal classic walls. —Drifts of gray illumination From the lofty fenestration Slant them down in bristling spines that spread Fan-like upon the vast dust-moted shade. Moveless here, no whit allied To the daemonian din outside, Statues stand, cadaverous, wan, Round the loiterers looking on Under the yawning dome and nave, Pondering whatnot, giddy or grave. Here a verger moves a chair, Or a red rope fixes there:— A brimming Hebe, rapt in her adorning, Brushes an Artemisia craped in mourning; Beatrice Benedick piques, coquetting; All unknowing or forgetting That strange Jew, Damascus-bound, Whose name, thereafter travelling round To this precinct of the world, Spread here like a flag unfurled: Anon inspiring architectural sages To frame this pile, writ his throughout the ages: Whence also the encircling mart Assumed his name, of him no part, And to his vision-seeing mind Charmless, blank in every kind; And whose displays, even had they called his eye, No gold or silver had been his to buy; Whose haunters, had they seen him stand On his own steps here, lift his hand In stress of eager, stammering speech, And his meaning chanced to reach, Would have proclaimed him as they passed An epilept enthusiast. COMING UP OXFORD STREET: EVENING The sun from the west glares back, And the sun from the watered track, And the sun from the sheets of glass, And the sun from each window-brass; Sun-mirrorings, too, brighten From show-cases beneath The laughing eyes and teeth Of ladies who rouge and whiten. And the same warm god explores Panels and chinks of doors; Problems with chymists' bottles Profound as Aristotle's He solves, and with good cause, Having been ere man was. Also he dazzles the pupils of one who walks west, A city-clerk, with eyesight not of the best, Who sees no escape to the very verge of his days From the rut of Oxford Street into open ways; And he goes along with head and eyes flagging forlorn, Empty of interest in things, and wondering why he was born, As seen July 4, 1872. A LAST JOURNEY “Father, you seem to have been sleeping fair?” The child uncovered the dimity-curtained window-square And looked out at the dawn, And back at the dying man nigh gone, And propped up in his chair, Whose breathing a robin's “chink” took up in antiphon. The open fireplace spread Like a vast weary yawn above his head, Its thin blue blower waved against his whitening crown, For he could not lie down: He raised him on his arms so emaciated:— “Yes; I've slept long, my child. But as for rest, Well, that I cannot say. The whole night have I footed field and turnpike way— A regular pilgrimage—as at my best And very briskest day! “'Twas first to Weatherb'ry, to see them there, And thence to King's-Stag, where I joined in a jolly trip to Weydon-Priors Fair: I shot for nuts, bought gingerbreads, cream-cheese; And, not content with these, I went to London: heard the watchmen cry the hours. “I soon was off again, and found me in the bowers Of father's apple-trees, And he shook the apples down: they fell in showers, Whereon he turned, smiled strange at me, as ill at ease; And then you pulled the curtain; and, ah me, I found me back where I wished not to be!” 'Twas told the child next day: “Your father's dead.” And, struck, she questioned, “O, That journey, then, did father really go?— Buy nuts, and cakes, and travel at night till dawn was red, And tire himself with journeying, as he said, To see those old friends that he cared for so?” SINGING LOVERS I rowed: the dimpled tide was at the turn, And mirth and moonlight spread upon the bay: There were two singing lovers in the stern; But mine had gone away,— Whither, I shunned to say! The houses stood confronting us afar, A livid line against the evening glare; The small lamps livened; then out-stole a star; But my Love was not there,— Vanished. I sorrowed where! His arm was round her, both full facing me With no reserve. Theirs was not love to hide; He held one tiller-rope, the other she; I pulled—the merest glide,— Looked on at them, and sighed. The moon's glassed glory heaved as we lay swinging Upon the undulations. Shoreward, slow, The plash of pebbles joined the lovers' singing, But she of a bygone vow Joined in the song not now! Weymouth. THE MONTH'S CALENDAR Tear off the calendar Of this month past, And all its weeks, that are Flown, to be cast To oblivion fast! Darken that day On which we met, With its words of gay Half-felt regret That you'll forget! The second day, too; The noon I nursed Well—thoughts; yes, through To the thirty-first; That was the worst. For then it was You let me see There was good cause Why you could not be Aught ever to me! A SPELLBOUND PALACE (HAMPTON COURT) On this kindly yellow day of mild low-travelling winter sun The stirless depths of the yews Are vague with misty blues: Across the spacious pathways stretching spires of shadow run, And the wind-gnawed walls of ancient brick are fired vermilion Two or three early sanguine finches tune Some tentative strains, to be enlarged by May or June: From a thrush or blackbird Comes now and then a word, While an enfeebled fountain somewhere within is heard. Our footsteps wait awhile, Then draw beneath the pile, When an inner court outspreads As 'twere History's own asile, Where the now-visioned fountain its attenuate crystal sheds In passive lapse that seems to ignore the yon world's clamorous clutch, And lays an insistent numbness on the place, like a cold hand's touch. And there swaggers the Shade of a straddling King, plumed, sworded, with sensual face, And lo, too, that of his Minister, at a bold self-centred pace: Sheer in the sun they pass; and thereupon all is still, Save the mindless fountain tinkling on with thin enfeebled will. WHEN DEAD TO ? It will be much better when I am under the bough; I shall be more myself, Dear, then, Than I am now. No sign of querulousness To wear you out Shall I show there: strivings and stress Be quite without. This fleeting life-brief blight Will have gone past When I resume my old and right Place in the Vast. And when you come to me To show you true, Doubt not I shall infallibly Be waiting you. SINE PROLE (MEDIAEVAL LATIN SEQUENCE-METRE) Forth from ages thick in mystery, Through the morn and noon of history, To the moment where I stand Has my line wound: I the last one— Outcome of each spectral past one Of that file, so many-manned! Nothing in its time-trail marred it: As one long life I regard it Throughout all the years till now, When it fain—the close seen coming— After annals past all plumbing— Makes to Being its parting bow. Unlike Jahveh's ancient nation, Little in their line's cessation Moderns see for surge of sighs: They have been schooled by lengthier vision, View Life's lottery with misprision, And its dice that fling no prize! TEN YEARS SINCE 'Tis ten years since I saw her on the stairs, Heard her in house-affairs, And listened to her cares; And the trees are ten feet taller, And the sunny spaces smaller Whose bloomage would enthrall her; And the piano wires are rustier, The smell of bindings mustier, And lofts and lumber dustier Than when, with casual look And ear, light note I took Of what shut like a book Those ten years since! Nov. 1922. EVERY ARTEMISIA “Your eye-light wanes with an ail of care, Frets freeze gray your face and hair.” “I was the woman who met him, Then cool and keen, Whiling away Time, with its restless scene on scene Every day.” “Your features fashion as in a dream Of things that were, or used to seem.” “I was the woman who won him: Steadfast and fond Was he, while I Tepidly took what he gave, nor conned Wherefore or why.” “Your house looks blistered by a curse, As if a wraith ruled there, or worse.” “I was the woman who slighted him: Far from my town Into the night He went. . . . My hair, then auburn-brown, Pangs have wanned white.” “Your ways reflect a monstrous gloom; Your voice speaks from within a tomb.” “I was the woman who buried him: My misery God laughed to scorn: The people said: ‘'Twere well if she Had not been born!’” “You plod to pile a monument So madly that your breath is spent.” “I am the woman who god him: I build, to ease My scalding fires, A temple topping the Deities' Fanes of my sires.” THE BEST SHE COULD Nine leaves a minute Swim down shakily; Each one fain would spin it Straight to earth; but, see, How the sharp airs win it Slantwise away!—Hear it say, “Now we have finished our summer show Of what we knew the way to do: Alas, not much! But, as things go, As fair as any. And night-time calls, And the curtain falls!” Sunlight goes on shining As if no frost were here, Blackbirds seem designing Where to build next year; Yet is warmth declining: And still the day seems to say, “Saw you how Dame Summer drest? Of all God taught her she bethought her! Alas, not much! And yet the best She could, within the too short time Granted her prime.” Nov. 8, 1923. THE GRAVEYARD OF DEAD CREEDS I lit upon the graveyard of dead creeds In wistful wanderings through old wastes of thought, Where bristled fennish fungi, fruiting nought, Amid the sepulchres begirt with weeds, Which stone by stone recorded sanct, deceased Catholicons that had, in centuries flown, Physicked created man through his long groan, Ere they went under, all their potence ceased. When in a breath-while, lo, their spectres rose Like wakened winds that autumn summons up:— “Out of us cometh an heir, that shall disclose New promise!” cried they. “And the caustic cup “We ignorantly upheld to men, be filled With draughts more pure than those we ever distilled, That shall make tolerable to sentient seers The melancholy marching of the years.” “THERE SEEMED A STRANGENESS” A PHANTASY There seemed a strangeness in the air, Vermilion light on the land's lean face; I heard a Voice from I knew not where:— “The Great Adjustment is taking place! “I set thick darkness over you, And fogged you all your years therein; At last I uncloud your view, Which I am weary of holding in. “Men have not heard, men have not seen Since the beginning of the world What earth and heaven mean; But now their curtains shall be furled, “And they shall see what is, ere long, Not through a glass, but face to face; And Right shall disestablish Wrong: The Great Adjustment is taking place.” A NIGHT OF QUESTIONINGS On the eve of All-Souls' Day I heard the dead men say Who lie by the tottering tower, To the dark and doubling wind At the midnight's turning hour, When other speech had thinned: “What of the world now?” The wind whiffed back: “Men still Who are born, do good, do ill Here, just as in your time: Till their years the locust hath eaten, Leaving them bare, downbeaten; Somewhiles in springtide rime, Somewhiles in summer glow, Somewhiles in winter snow:— No more I know.” The same eve I caught cry To the selfsame wind, those dry As dust beneath the aisles Of old cathedral piles, Walled up in vaulted biers Through many Christian years: “What of the world now?” Sighed back the circuiteer: “Men since your time, shrined here By deserved ordinance, Their own craft, or by chance, Which follows men from birth Even until under earth, But little difference show When ranged in sculptured row, Different as dyes although:— No more I know.” On the selfsame eve, too, said Those swayed in the sunk sea-bed To the selfsame wind as it played With the tide in the starless shade From Comorin to Horn, And round by Wrath forlorn: “What of the world now?” And the wind for a second ceased, Then whirred: “Men west and east, As each sun soars and dips, Go down to the sea in ships As you went—hither and thither; See the wonders of the deep, As you did, ere they sleep; But few at home care whither They wander to and fro; Themselves care little also!— No more I know.” Said, too, on the selfsame eve The troubled skulls that heave And fust in the flats of France, To the wind wayfaring over Listlessly as in trance From the Ardennes to Dover, “What of the world now?” And the farer moaned: “As when You mauled these fields, do men Set them with dark-drawn breaths To knave their neighbours' deaths In periodic spasms! Yea, fooled by foul phantasms, In a strange cyclic throe Backward to type they go:— No more I know.” That night, too, men whose crimes Had cut them off betimes, Who lay within the pales Of town and county jails With the rope-groove on them yet, Said to the same wind's fret, “What of the world now?” And the blast in its brooding tone Returned: “Men have not shown, Since you were stretched that morning, A white cap your adorning, More lovely deeds or true Through thus neck-knotting you; Or that they purer grow, Or ever will, I trow!— No more I know.” XENOPHANES, THE MONIST OF COLOPHON Ann: aet: suae XCII.—A: C: CCCCLXXX. “Are You groping Your way? Do You do it unknowing?— Or mark Your wind blowing? Night tell You from day, O Mover? Come, say!” Cried Xenophanes. “I mean, querying so, Do You do it aware, Or by rote, like a player, Or in ignorance, nor care Whether doing or no?” Pressed Xenophanes “Thus strive I to plumb Your depths, O Great Dumb!— Not a god, but the All (As I read); yet a thrall To a blind ritual,” Sighed Xenophanes. “If I only could bring You to own it, close Thing, I would write it again With a still stronger pen To my once neighbour-men!” Said Xenophanes. —Quoth the listening Years: “You ask It in vain; You waste sighs and tears On these callings inane, Which It grasps not nor hears, O Xenophanes! “When you penned what you thought You were cast out, and sought A retreat over sea From aroused enmity: So it always will be, Yea, Xenophanes! “In the lone of the nights At Elea unseen, Where the swinging wave smites Of the restless Tyrrhene, You may muse thus, serene, Safe, Xenophanes. “But write it not back To your dear Colophon; Brows still will be black At your words, ‘All is One,’ From disputers thereon, Know, Xenophanes. “Three thousand years hence, Men who hazard a clue To this riddle immense, And still treat it as new, Will be scowled at, like you, O Xenophanes! “‘Some day I may tell, When I've broken My spell,’ It snores in Its sleep If you listen long, deep At Its closely-sealed cell, Wronged Xenophanes! “Yea, on, near the end, Its doings may mend; Aye, when you're forgotten, And old cults are rotten, And bulky codes shotten, Xenophanes!” 1921. LIFE AND DEATH AT SUNRISE (NEAR DOGBURY GATE, 1867) The hills uncap their tops Of woodland, pasture, copse, And look on the layers of mist At their foot that still persist: They are like awakened sleepers on one elbow lifted, Who gaze around to learn if things during night have shifted. A waggon creaks up from the fog With a laboured leisurely jog; Then a horseman from off the hill-tip Comes clapping down into the dip; While woodlarks, finches, sparrows, try to entune at one time, And cocks and hens and cows and bulls take up the chime. With a shouldered basket and flagon A man meets the one with the waggon, And both the men halt of long use. “Well,” the waggoner says, “what's the news?” “—'Tis a boy this time. You've just met the doctor trotting back. She's doing very well. And we think we shall call him ‘Jack.’ “And what have you got covered there?” He nods to the waggon and mare. “Oh, a coffin for old John Thinn: We are just going to put him in.” “—So he's gone at last. He always had a good constitution.” “—He was ninety-odd. He could call up the French Revolution.” NIGHT-TIME IN MID-FALL It is a storm-strid night, winds footing swift Through the blind profound; I know the happenings from their sound; Leaves totter down still green, and spin and drift; The tree-trunks rock to their roots, which wrench and lift The loam where they run onward underground. The streams are muddy and swollen; eels migrate To a new abode; Even cross, 'tis said, the turnpike-road; (Men's feet have felt their crawl, home-coming late): The westward fronts of towers are saturate, Church-timbers crack, and witches ride abroad. A SHEEP FAIR The day arrives of the autumn fair, And torrents fall, Though sheep in throngs are gathered there, Ten thousand all, Sodden, with hurdles round them reared: And, lot by lot, the pens are cleared, And the auctioneer wrings out his beard, And wipes his book, bedrenched and smeared, And rakes the rain from his face with the edge of his hand, As torrents fall. The wool of the ewes is like a sponge With the daylong rain: Jammed tight, to turn, or lie, or lunge, They strive in vain. Their horns are soft as finger-nails, Their shepherds reek against the rails, The tied dogs soak with tucked-in tails, The buyers' hat-brims fill like pails, Which spill small cascades when they shift their stand In the daylong rain. Postscript Time has trailed lengthily since met At Pummery Fair Those panting thousands in their wet And woolly wear: And every flock long since has bled, And all the dripping buyers have sped, And the hoarse auctioneer is dead, Who “Going—going!” so often said, As he consigned to doom each meek, mewed band At Pummery Fair. SNOW IN THE SUBURBS Every branch big with it, Bent every twig with it; Every fork like a white web-foot; Every street and pavement mute: Some flakes have lost their way, and grope back upward, when Meeting those meandering down they turn and descend again. The palings are glued together like a wall, And there is no waft of wind with the fleecy fall. A sparrow enters the tree, Whereon immediately A snow-lump thrice his own slight size Descends on him and showers his head and eyes. And overturns him, And near inurns him, And lights on a nether twig, when its brush Starts off a volley of other lodging lumps with a rush. The steps are a blanched slope, Up which, with feeble hope, A black cat comes, wide-eyed and thin; And we take him in. A LIGHT SNOW-FALL AFTER FROST On the flat road a man at last appears: How much his whitening hairs Owe to the settling snow's mute anchorage, And how much to a life's rough pilgrimage, One cannot certify. The frost is on the wane, And cobwebs hanging close outside the pane Pose as festoons of thick white worsted there, Of their pale presence no eye being aware Till the rime made them plain. A second man comes by; His ruddy beard brings fire to the pallid scene: His coat is faded green; Hence seems it that his mien Wears something of the dye Of the berried holm-trees that he passes nigh. The snow-feathers so gently swoop that though But half an hour ago The road was brown, and now is starkly white, A watcher would have failed defining quite When it transformed it so. Near Surbiton. WINTER NIGHT IN WOODLAND (OLD TIME) The bark of a fox rings, sonorous and long:— Three barks, and then silentness; “wong, wong, wong!” In quality horn-like, yet melancholy, As from teachings of years; for an old one is he. The hand of all men is against him, he knows; and yet, why? That he knows not,—will never know, down to his death-halloo cry. With clap-nets and lanterns off start the bird-baiters, In trim to make raids on the roosts in the copse, Where they beat the boughs artfully, while their awaiters Grow heavy at home over divers warm drops. The poachers, with swingels, and matches of brimstone, outcreep To steal upon pheasants and drowse them a-perch and asleep. Out there, on the verge, where a path wavers through, Dark figures, filed singly, thrid quickly the view, Yet heavily laden: land-carriers are they In the hire of the smugglers from some nearest bay. Each bears his two “tubs,” slung across, one in front, one behind, To a further snug hiding, which none but themselves are to find. And then, when the night has turned twelve the air brings From dim distance, a rhythm of voices and strings: 'Tis the quire, just afoot on their long yearly rounds, To rouse by worn carols each house in their bounds; Robert Penny, the Dewys, Mail, Voss, and the rest; till anon Tired and thirsty, but cheerful, they home to their beds in the dawn. ICE ON THE HIGHWAY Seven buxom women abreast, and arm in arm, Trudge down the hill, tip-toed, And breathing warm; They must perforce trudge thus, to keep upright On the glassy ice-bound road, And they must get to market whether or no, Provisions running low With the nearing Saturday night, While the lumbering van wherein they mostly ride Can nowise go: Yet loud their laughter as they stagger and slide! Yell'ham Hill. MUSIC IN A SNOWY STREET The weather is sharp, But the girls are unmoved: One wakes from a harp, The next from a viol, A strain that I loved When life was no trial. The tripletime beat Bounds forth on the snow, But the spry springing feet Of a century ago, And the arms that enlaced As the couples embraced, Are silent old bones Under graying gravestones. The snow-feathers sail Across the harp-strings, Whose throbbing threads wail Like love-satiate things. Each lyre's grimy mien, With its rout-raising tune, Against the new white Of the flake-laden noon, Is incongruous to sight, Hinting years they have seen Of revel at night Ere these damsels became Possessed of their frame. O bygone whirls, heys, Crotchets, quavers, the same That were danced in the days Of grim Bonaparte's fame, Or even by the toes Of the fair Antoinette,— Yea, old notes like those Here are living on yet!— But of their fame and fashion How little these know Who strum without passion For pence, in the snow! THE FROZEN GREENHOUSE (ST. JULIOT) “There was a frost Last night!” she said, “And the stove was forgot When we went to bed, And the greenhouse plants Are frozen dead!” By the breakfast blaze Blank-faced spoke she, Her scared young look Seeming to be The very symbol Of tragedy. The frost is fiercer Than then to-day, As I pass the place Of her once dismay, But the greenhouse stands Warm, tight, and gay, While she who grieved At the sad lot Of her pretty plants— Cold, iced, forgot— Herself is colder, And knows it not. TWO LIPS I kissed them in fancy as I came Away in the morning glow: I kissed them through the glass of her picture-frame: She did not know. I kissed them in love, in troth, in laughter, When she knew all; long so! That I should kiss them in a shroud thereafter She did not know. NO BUYERS A STREET SCENE A load of brushes and baskets and cradles and chairs Labours along the street in the rain: With it a man, a woman, a pony with whiteybrown hairs.— The man foots in front of the horse with a shambling sway At a slower tread than a funeral train, While to a dirge-like tune he chants his wares, Swinging a Turk's-head brush (in a drum-major's way When the bandsmen march and play). A yard from the back of the man is the whiteybrown pony's nose: He mirrors his master in every item of pace and pose: He stops when the man stops, without being told, And seems to be eased by a pause; too plainly he's old, Indeed, not strength enough shows To steer the disjointed waggon straight, Which wriggles left and right in a rambling line, Deflected thus by its own warp and weight, And pushing the pony with it in each incline. The woman walks on the pavement verge, Parallel to the man: She wears an apron white and wide in span, And carries a like Turk's-head, but more in nursing-wise: Now and then she joins in his dirge, But as if her thoughts were on distant things. The rain clams her apron till it clings.— So, step by step, they move with their merchandize, And nobody buys. ONE WHO MARRIED ABOVE HIM “'Tis you, I think? Back from your week's work, Steve?” “It is I. Back from work this Christmas Eve.” “But you seem off again?—in this night-rime?” “I am off again, and thoroughly off this time.” “What does that mean?” “More than may first be seen. . . . Half an hour ago I footed homeward here, No wife found I, nor child, nor maid, indoors or near. She has, as always, gone with them to her mother's at the farm, Where they fare better far than here, and, maybe, meet less harm. She's left no fire, no light, has cooked me nothing to eat, Though she had fuel, and money to get some Christmas meat. Christmas with them is grand, she knows, and brings good victual, Other than how it is here, where it's but lean and little. But though not much, and rough, If managed neat there's enough. She and hers are too highmade for me; But she's whimmed her once too often, she'll see! Farmer Bollen's daughter should never have married a man that's poor; And I can stand it no longer; I'm leaving; you'll see me no more, be sure.” “But nonsense: you'll be back again ere bedtime, and lighting a fire, And sizzling your supper, and vexing not that her views of supper are higher.” “Never for me.” “Well, we shall see.” The sceptical neighbour and Stephen then followed their fore-designed ways, And their steps dimmed into white silence upon the slippery glaze; And the trees went on with their spitting amid the icicled haze. The evening whiled, and the wife with the babies came home, But he was not there, nor all Christmas Day did he come. Christmastide went, and likewise went the New Year, But no husband's footfall revived, And month after month lapsed, graytime to green and to sere, And other new years arrived, And the children grew up: one husbanded and one wived.— She wept and repented, But Stephen never relented. And there stands the house, and the sycamore-tree and all. With its roots forming steps for the passers who care to call, And there are the mullioned windows, and Ham-Hill door, Through which Steve's wife was brought out, but which Steve re-entered no more. THE NEW TOY She cannot leave it alone, The new toy; She pats it, smooths it, rights it, to show it's her own, As the other train-passengers muse on its temper and tone Till she draws from it cries of annoy:— She feigns to appear as if thinking it nothing so rare Or worthy of pride, to achieve This wonder a child, though with reason the rest of them there May so be inclined to believe. QUEEN CAROLINE TO HER GUESTS Dear friends, stay! Lamplit wafts of wit keep sorrow In the purlieus of to-morrow: Dear friends, stay! Haste not away! Even now may Time be weaving Tricks of ravage, wrack, bereaving: Haste not away! Through the pane, Lurking along the street, there may be Heartwrings, keeping hid till day be, Through the pane. Check their reign: Since while here we are the masters, And can barricade dim disasters: Check their reign! Give no ear To those ghosts withoutside mumming, Mouthing, threatening, “We are coming!” Give no ear! Sheltered here Care we not that next day bring us Pains, perversions! No racks wring us Sheltered here. Homeward gone, Sleep will slay this merrymaking; No resuming it at waking, Homeward gone. After dawn Something sad may be befalling; Mood like ours there's no recalling After dawn! Morrow-day Present joy that moments strengthen May be past our power to lengthen, Morrow-day! Dear friends, stay! Lamplit wafts of wit keep sorrow In the limbo of to-morrow: Dear friends, stay! PLENA TIMORIS The lovers looked over the parapet-stone: The moon in its southing directly blent Its silver with their environment. Her ear-rings twinkled; her teeth, too, shone As, his arm around her, they laughed and leant. A man came up to them; then one more. “There's a woman in the canal below,” They said; climbed over; slid down; let go, And a splashing was heard, till an arm upbore, And a dripping body began to show. “Drowned herself for love of a man, Who at one time used to meet her here, Until he grew tired. But she'd wait him near, And hope, till hopeless despair began. So much for love in this mortal sphere!” The girl's heart shuddered; it seemed as to freeze her That here, at their tryst for so many a day, Another woman's tragedy lay. Dim dreads of the future grew slowly to seize her, And her arm dropt from his as they wandered away. THE WEARY WALKER A plain in front of me, And there's the road Upon it. Wide country, And, too, the road! Past the first ridge another, And still the road Creeps on. Perhaps no other Ridge for the road? Ah! Past that ridge a third, Which still the road Has to climb furtherward— The thin white road! Sky seems to end its track; But no. The road Trails down the hill at the back. Ever the road! LAST LOVE-WORD (SONG) This is the last; the very, very last! Anon, and all is dead and dumb, Only a pale shroud over the past, That cannot be Of value small or vast, Love, then to me! I can say no more: I have even said too much. I did not mean that this should come: I did not know 'twould swell to such— Nor, perhaps, you— When that first look and touch, Love, doomed us two! 189?. NOBODY COMES Tree-leaves labour up and down, And through them the fainting light Succumbs to the crawl of night. Outside in the road the telegraph wire To the town from the darkening land Intones to travellers like a spectral lyre Swept by a spectral hand. A car comes up, with lamps full-glare, That flash upon a tree: It has nothing to do with me, And whangs along in a world of its own, Leaving a blacker air; And mute by the gate I stand again alone, And nobody pulls up there. October 9, 1924. IN THE STREET (SONG) Only acquaintances Seem do we, Each of whom, meeting, says Civilly “Good morning.”—Yes: thus we appear to be! But far, near, left and right, Here or there, By day or dingiest night, Everywhere I see you: one incomparably fair! So do we wend our ways, Beautiful girl, Along our parallel days; While unfurl Our futures, and what there may whelm and whirl. THE LAST LEAF “The leaves throng thick above:— Well, I'll come back, dear Love, When they all are down!” She watched that August tree, (None now scorned summer as she), Till it broidered it brown. And then October came blowing, And the leaves showed signs they were going, And she saw up through them. O how she counted them then! —November left her but ten, And started to strew them. “Ah, when they all are gone, And the skeleton-time comes on, Whom shall I see!” —When the fifteenth spread its sky That month, her upturned eye Could count but three. And at the close of the week A flush flapped over her cheek: The last one fell. But—he did not come. And, at length, Her hope of him lost all strength, And it was as a knell. . . . When he did come again, Years later, a husband then, Heavy somewhat, With a smile she reminded him: And he cried: “Ah, that vow of our whim!— Which I forgot, “As one does!—And was that the tree? So it was!—Dear me, dear me: Yes: I forgot.” AT WYNYARD'S GAP She (on horseback) The hounds pass here? He (on horseback) They did an hour ago, Just in full cry, and went down-wind, I saw, Towards Pen Wood, where they may kill, and draw A second time, and bear towards the Yeo. She How vexing! And I've crept along unthinking. He Ah!—lost in dreams. Fancy to fancy linking! She (more softly) Not that, quite. . . . Now, to settle what I'll do. He Go home again. But have you seen the view From the top there? Not? It's really worth your while.— You must dismount, because there is a stile. They dismount, hitch their horses, and climb a few-score yards from the road. There you see half South Wessex,—combe, and glen, And down, to Lewsdon Hill and Pilsdon Pen. She Yes. It is fine. And I, though living out there By Crewkerne, never knew it. (She turns her head) Well, I declare, Look at the horses!—How shall I catch my mare? The horses have got loose and scampered off. Now that's your fault, through leading me up here! You must have known 'twould happen— He No, my dear! She I'm not your dear. He (blandly) But you can't help being so, If it comes to that. The fairest girl I've seen Is of course dear—by her own fault, I mean. She (quickly) What house is that we see just down below? He Oh—that's the inn called “Wynyard's Gap.”—I'll go While you wait here, and catch those brutes. Don't stir. He goes. She waits. She What a handsome man. Not local, I'll aver. He comes back. He I met a farmer's labourer some way on; He says he'll bring them to us here anon, If possible before the day is dim. Come down to the inn: there we can wait for him. They descend slowly in that direction. She What a lonely inn. Why is there such a one? He For us to wait at. Thus 'tis things are done. She Thus things are done? Well—what things do you mean? He Romantic things. Meetings unknown, unseen. She But ours is accident, and needn't have been, And isn't what I'd plan with a stranger, quite, Particularly at this time—nearly night. He Nor I. But still, the tavern's loneliness Is favourable for lovers in distress, When they've eloped, for instance, and are in fear Of being pursued. No one would find them here. He goes to speak to the labourer approaching; and returns. He says the horses long have passed the combe, And cannot be overtaken. They'll go home. She And what's to be done? And it's beginning to rain. 'Tis always so. One trouble brings a train! He It seems to me that here we'd better stay And rest us till some vehicle comes this way: In fact, we might put up here till the morning: The floods are high, and night-farers have warning. She Put up? Do you think so! He I incline to such, My dear (do you mind?) She Yes.—Well (more softly), I don't much, If I seem like it. But I ought to tell you One thing. I'm married. Being so, it's well you— He Oh, so am I. (A silence, he regarding her) I note a charming thing— You stand so stock-still that your ear-ring shakes At each pulsation which the vein there makes. She Does it? Perhaps because it's flustering To be caught thus! (In a murmur) Why did we chance to meet here! He God knows! Perhaps to taste a bitter-sweet here.— Still, let us enter. Shelter we must get: The night is darkening and is growing wet. So, anyhow, you can treat me as a lover Just for this once. To-morrow 'twill be over! They reach the inn. The door is locked, and they discern a board marked “To Let.” While they stand stultified a van is seen drawing near, with passengers. She Ah, here's an end of it! The Crewkerne carrier. He So cynic circumstance erects its barrier! She (mischievously) To your love-making, which would have grown stronger, No doubt, if we had stayed on here much longer? The carrier comes up. Her companion reluctantly hails him. He Yes. . . . And in which you might have shown some ruth, Had but the inn been open!—Well, forsooth, I'm sorry it's not. Are you? Now, dear, the truth! She (with gentle evasiveness) I am—almost. But best 'tis thus to be. For—dear one—there I've said it!—you can see That both at one inn (though roomed separately, Of course)—so lone, too—might have been unfit, Perfect as 'tis for lovers, I admit. He (after a sigh) Carrier! A lift for my wife, please. She (in quick undertones) Wife? But nay— He (continuing) Her horse has thrown her and has gone astray: See she gets safe to Crewkerne. I've to stay. Carrier I will, sir! I'm for Crookhorn straight away. He (to her, aloud) Right now, dear. I shall soon be home. Adieu! (Kisses her.) She (whispering confusedly) You shouldn't! Pretending you are my husband, too! I now must act the part of wife to you! He (whispering) Yes, since I've kissed you, dear. You see it's done To silence tongues as we're found here alone At night, by gossipers, and seem as shown Staying together! She (whispering) Then must I, too, kiss? He Yes: a mere matter of form, you know, To check all scandal. People will talk so! She I'd no idea it would reach to this! (Kisses him.) What makes it worse is, I'm ashamed to say, I've a young baby waiting me at home! He Ah—there you beat me!—But, my dearest, play The wife to the end, and don't give me away, Despite the baby, since we've got so far, And what we've acted feel we almost are! She (sighing) Yes. 'Tis so! And my conscience has gone dumb! (Aloud) 'Bye, dear, awhile! I'll sit up till you come. (In a whisper) Which means Good-bye for ever, truly heard! Upon to-night be silent! He Never a word, Till Pilsdon Pen by Marshwood wind is stirred! He hands her up. Exeunt omnes. AT SHAG'S HEATH 1685 (TRADITIONAL) I grieve and grieve for what I have done, And nothing now is left to me But straight to drown; yea, I have slain The rarest soul the world shall see! —My husband said: “Now thou art wed Thou must beware! And should a man Cajole, mind, he means ill to thee, Depend on't: fool him if ye can!” But 'twas King Monmouth, he! As truth I took what was not true: Till darked my door just such a one. He asked me but the way to go, Though looking all so down and done. And as he stood he said, unsued, “The prettiest wife I've eyed to-day!” And then he kissed me tenderly Before he footed fast away Did dear King Monmouth, he! Builded was he so beautiful!— Why did I pout a pettish word For what he'd done?—Then whisking off— For his pursuers' feet were heard— “Dear one, keep faith!” he turns and saith. And next he vanished in the copse Before I knew what such might be, And how great fears and how great hopes Had rare King Monmouth—he! Up rode the soldiers. “Where's this man?— He is the rebel Duke,” say they. “And calls himself King Monmouth, sure!” Then I believed my husband; aye, Though he'd spoke lies in jealous-wise! —To Shag's nigh copse beyond the road I moved my finger mercilessly; And there lay hidden where I showed: My dear King Monmouth, he! The soldiers brought him by my door, His elbows bound behind him, fast; Passing, he me-ward cast his eyes— What eyes of beauty did he cast! Grieved was his glance at me askance: “I wished all weal might thee attend, But this is what th'st done to me, O heartless woman, held my friend!” Said sweet King Monmouth, he! O then I saw he was no hind, But a great lord of loftihood, Come here to claim his rule and rights, Who'd wished me, as he'd said, but good.— With tug and jolt, then, out to Holt, To Justice Ettricke, he was led, And thence to London speedily, Where under yester's headsman bled The rare King Monmouth, he! Last night, the while my husband slept, He rose up at the window there, All blood and blear, and hacked about, With heavy eyes, and rumpled hair; And said: “My Love, 'twas cruel of A Fair like thee to use me so! But now it's nought: from foes I'm free! Sooner or later all must go,” Said dear King Monmouth, he! “Yes, lovely cruel one!” he said In through the mullioned pane, shroud-pale, “I love you still, would kiss you now, But blood would stain your nighty-rail!” —That's all. And so to drown I go: O wear no weeds, my friends, for me . . . When comes the waterman, he'll say, “Who's done her thuswise?”—'Twill be, yea, Sweet, slain King Monmouth—he! A SECOND ATTEMPT Thirty years after I began again An old-time passion: And it seemed as fresh as when The first day ventured on: When mutely I would waft her In Love's past fashion Dreams much dwelt upon, Dreams I wished she knew. I went the course through, From Love's fresh-found sensation— Remembered still so well— To worn words charged anew, That left no more to tell: Thence to hot hopes and fears, And thence to consummation, And thence to sober years, Markless, and mellow-hued. Firm the whole fabric stood, Or seemed to stand, and sound As it had stood before. But nothing backward climbs, And when I looked around As at the former times, There was Life—pale and hoar; And slow it said to me, “Twice-over cannot be!” “FREED THE FRET OF THINKING” Freed the fret of thinking, Light of lot were we, Song with service linking Like to bird or bee: Chancing bale unblinking, Freed the fret of thinking On mortality! Had not thought-endowment Beings ever known, What Life once or now meant None had wanted shown— Measuring but the moment— Had not thought-endowment Caught Creation's groan! Loosed from wrings of reason, We might blow like flowers, Sense of Time-wrought treason Would not then be ours In and out of season; Loosed from wrings of reason We should laud the Powers! THE ABSOLUTE EXPLAINS I “O no,” said It: her lifedoings Time's touch hath not destroyed: They lie their length, with the throbbing things Akin them, down the Void, Live, unalloyed. II “Know, Time is toothless, seen all through; The Present, that men but see, Is phasmal: since in a sane purview All things are shaped to be Eternally. III “Your ‘Now’ is just a gleam, a glide Across your gazing sense: With me, ‘Past,’ ‘Future,’ ever abide: They come not, go not, whence They are never hence. IV “As one upon a dark highway, Plodding by lantern-light, Finds but the reach of its frail ray Uncovered to his sight, Though mid the night V “The road lies all its length the same, Forwardly as at rear, So, outside what you ‘Present’ name, Future and Past stand sheer, Cognate and clear.” VI —Thus It: who straightway opened then The vista called the Past, Wherein were seen, as fair as when They seemed they could not last, Small things and vast. VII There were those songs, a score times sung, With all their tripping tunes, There were the laughters once that rung, There those unmatched full moons, Those idle noons! VIII There fadeless, fixed, were dust-dead flowers Remaining still in blow; Elsewhere, wild love-makings in bowers; Hard by, that irised bow Of years ago. IX There were my ever memorable Glad days of pilgrimage, Coiled like a precious parchment fell, Illumined page by page, Unhurt by age. X “—Here you see spread those mortal ails So powerless to restrain Your young life's eager hot assails, With hazards then not plain Till past their pain. XI “Here you see her who, by these laws You learn of, still shines on, As pleasing-pure as erst she was, Though you think she lies yon, Graved, glow all gone. XII “Here are those others you used to prize.— But why go further we? The Future?—Well, I would advise You let the future be, Unshown by me! XIII “'Twould harrow you to see undraped The scenes in ripe array That wait your globe—all worked and shaped; And I'll not, as I say, Bare them to-day. XIV “In fine, Time is a mock,—yea, such!— As he might well confess: Yet hath he been believed in much, Though lately, under stress Of science, less. XV “And hence, of her you asked about At your first speaking: she Hath, I assure you, not passed out Of continuity, But is in me. XVI “So thus doth Being's length transcend Time's ancient regal claim To see all lengths begin and end. ‘The Fourth Dimension’ fame Bruits as its name.” New Year's Eve, 1922. “SO, TIME” (The same thought resumed) So, Time, Royal, sublime; Heretofore held to be Master and enemy, Thief of my Love's adornings, Despoiling her to scornings:— The sound philosopher Now sets him to aver You are nought But a thought Without reality. Young, old, Passioned, cold, All the loved-lost thus Are beings continuous, In dateless dure abiding, Over the present striding With placid permanence That knows not transience: Firm in the Vast, First, last; Afar, yet close to us. AN INQUIRY A PHANTASY Circumdederunt me dolores mortis. —Ps. xviii. I said to It: “We grasp not what you meant, (Dwelling down here, so narrowly pinched and pent) By crowning Death the King of the Firmament: —The query I admit to be One of unwonted size, But it is put you sorrowingly, And not in idle-wise.” “Sooth, since you ask me gravely,” It replied, “Though too incisive questions I have decried, This shows some thought, and may be justified. I'll gauge its value as I go Across the Universe, And bear me back in a moment or so And say, for better or worse.” Many years later, when It came again, “That matter an instant back which brought you pain,” It said, “and you besought me to explain: Well, my forethoughtless modes to you May seem a shameful thing, But—I'd no meaning, that I knew, In crowning Death as King!” THE FAITHFUL SWALLOW When summer shone Its sweetest on An August day, “Here evermore,” I said, “I'll stay; Not go away To another shore As fickle they!” December came: 'Twas not the same! I did not know Fidelity Would serve me so. Frost, hunger, snow; And now, ah me, Too late to go! IN SHERBORNE ABBEY (17??) The moon has passed to the panes of the south-aisle wall, And brought the mullioned shades and shines to fall On the cheeks of a woman and man in a pew there, pressed Together as they pant, and recline for rest. Forms round them loom, recumbent like their own, Yet differing; for they are chiselled in frigid stone; In doublets are some; some mailed, as whilom ahorse they leapt: And stately husbands and wives, side by side as they anciently slept. “We are not like those,” she murmurs. “For ever here set!” “True, Love,” he replies. “We two are not marble yet.” “And, worse,” said she; “not husband and wife!” “But we soon shall be” (from him) “if we've life!” A silence. A trotting of horses is heard without. The lovers scarce breathe till its echo has quite died out. “It was they! They have passed, anyhow!” “Our horse, slily hid by the conduit, They've missed, or they'd rushed to impound it!” “And they'll not discover us now.” “Will not, until 'tis too late, And we can outface them straight!” “Why did you make me ride in your front?” says she. “To outwit the law. That was my strategy. As I was borne off on the pillion behind you, Th'abductor was you, Dearest, let me remind you; And seizure of me by an heiress is no felony, Whatever to do it with me as the seizer may be.” Another silence sinks. And a cloud comes over the moon: The print of the panes upon them enfeebles, as fallen in a swoon, Until they are left in darkness unbroke and profound, As likewise are left their chill and chiselled neighbours around. A Family tradition. THE PAIR HE SAW PASS O sad man, now a long dead man, To whom it was so real, I picture, as 'twere yesterday, How you would tell the tale! Just wived were you, you sad dead man, And “settling down,” you'd say, And had rigged the house you had reared for yourself And the mate now yours alway. You had eyed and tried each door and lock, And cupboard, and bell, and glass, When you glanced across to the road without, And saw a carriage pass. It bowled along from the old town-gate; Two forms its freight, and those Were a just-joined pair, as you discerned By the favours and the bows. And one of the pair you saw was a Fair Whom you had wooed awhile, And the other you saw, with a creeping awe, Was yourself, in bridegroom style. “And there we rode as man and wife In the broad blaze of the sun,” Would you aver; yea, you with her You had left for another one. “The morning,” you said, my friend long dead, “Was ordinary and fine; And yet there gleamed, it somehow seemed, At moments, a strange shine.” You hailed a boy from your garden-plot, And sent him along the way To the parish church; whence word was brought No marriage had been that day. You mused, you said; till you heard anon That at that hour she died Whom once, instead of your living wife, You had meant to make your bride. . . . You, dead man, dwelt in your new-built house With no great spirit or will, And after your soon decease your spouse Re-mated: she lives there still. Which should be blamed, if either can, The teller does not know For your mismatch, O weird-wed man, Or what you thought was so. From an old draft. THE MOCK WIFE It's a dark drama, this; and yet I know the house, and date; That is to say, the where and when John Channing met his fate. The house was one in High Street, seen of burghers still alive, The year was some two centuries bygone; seventeen-hundred and five And dying was Channing the grocer. All the clocks had struck eleven, And the watchers saw that ere the dawn his soul would be in Heaven; When he said on a sudden: “I should like to kiss her before I go,— For one last time!” They looked at each other and murmured, “Even so.” She'd just been haled to prison, his wife; yea, charged with shaping his death: By poison, 'twas told; and now he was nearing the moment of his last breath: He, witless that his young housemate was suspect of such a crime, Lay thinking that his pangs were but a malady of the time. Outside the room they pondered gloomily, wondering what to do, As still he craved her kiss—the dying man who nothing knew: “Guilty she may not be,” they said; “so why should we torture him In these his last few minutes of life? Yet how indulge his whim?” And as he begged there piteously for what could not be done, And the murder-charge had flown about the town to every one, The friends around him in their trouble thought of a hasty plan, And straightway set about it. Let denounce them all who can. “O will you do a kindly deed—it may be a soul to save; At least, great misery to a man with one foot in the grave?” Thus they to the buxom woman not unlike his prisoned wife; “The difference he's past seeing; it will soothe his sinking life.” Well, the friendly neighbour did it; and he kissed her; held her fast; Kissed her again and yet again. “I—knew she'd—come at last!— Where have you been?—Ah, kept away!—I'm sorry—overtried— God bless you!” And he loosed her, fell back tiredly, and died. His wife stood six months after on the scaffold before the crowd, Ten thousand of them gathered there; fixed, silent, and hard-browed. To see her strangled and burnt to dust, as was the verdict then On women truly judged, or false, of doing to death their men. Some of them said as they watched her burn: “I am glad he never knew, Since a few hold her as innocent—think such she could not do! Glad, too, that (as they tell) he thought she kissed him ere he died.” And they seemed to make no question that the cheat was justified. THE FIGHT ON DURNOVER MOOR (183?) We'd loved, we two, some while, And that had come which comes when men too much beguile; And without more ado My lady said: “O shame! Get home, and hide!” But he was true. Yes: he was true to me, And helped me some miles homealong; and vowing to come Before the weeks were three, And do in church a deed should strike all scandal dumb. And when we had traipsed to Grey's great Bridge, and pitched my box On its cope, to breathe us there, He cried: “What wrangle's that in yonder moor? Those knocks, Gad, seem not to be fair! “And a woman on her knees! . . . I'll go. . . . There's surely something wrong!” I said: “You are tired and spent With carrying my heavy things so far and long!” But he would go, and went. And there I stood, steadying my box, and screened from none, Upon the crown of the bridge, Ashamed o' my shape, as lower and lower slipped the sun Down behind Pummery Ridge. . . . “O you may long wait so! Your young man's done—aye, dead!” they by and by ran and cried. “You shouldn't have let him go And join that whorage, but have kept him at your side! “It was another wench, Biggening as you, that he championed: yes, he came on straight With a warmth no words could quench For her helpless face, as soon as ever he eyed her state, “And fought her fancy-lad, who had used her far from well, So soon to make her moan, Aye, closed with him in fight, till at a blow yours fell, His skull against a stone. “She'd followed him there, this man who'd won her, and overwon, So, when he set to twit her Yours couldn't abide him—him all other fighters shun, For he's a practised hitter. “Your man moved not, and the constables came for the other; so he, He'll never make her his wife Any more than yours will you; for they say that at least 'twill be Across the water for life.” “O what has she brought about!” I groaned; “this woman met here in my selfsame plight; She's put another yielding heart's poor candle out By dogging her man to-night! “He might never have done her his due Of amends! But mine had bidden the banns for marrying me! Why did we rest on this bridge; why rush to a quarrel did he With which he had nothing to do!” But vain were bursts of blame: We twain stood like and like, though strangers till that hour, Foredoomed to tread our paths beneath like gaze and glower, Bear a like blushful name. Almost the selfsame day It fell that her time and mine came on,—a lad and a lass: The father o' mine was where the worms waggle under the grass, Of hers, at Botany Bay. LAST LOOK ROUND ST. MARTIN'S FAIR The sun is like an open furnace door, Whose round revealed retort confines the roar Of fires beyond terrene; The moon presents the lustre-lacking face Of a brass dial gone green, Whose hours no eye can trace. The unsold heathcroppers are driven home To the shades of the Great Forest whence they come By men with long cord-waistcoats in brown monochrome. The stars break out, and flicker in the breeze, It seems, that twitches the trees.— From its hot idol soon The fickle unresting earth has turned to a fresh patroon— The cold, now brighter, moon. The woman in red, at the nut-stall with the gun, Lights up, and still goes on: She's redder in the flare-lamp than the sun Showed it ere it was gone. Her hands are black with loading all the day, And yet she treats her labour as 'twere play, Tosses her ear-rings, and talks ribaldry To the young men around as natural gaiety, And not a weary work she'd readily stay, And never again nut-shooting see, Though crying, “Fire away!” THE CARICATURE Of the Lady Lu there were stories told, For she was a woman of comely mould, In heart-experience old. Too many a man for her whimful sake Had borne with patience chill and ache, And nightly lain awake! This epicure in pangs, in her tooth For more of the sweet, with a calm unruth Cast eyes on a painter-youth. Her junior he; and the bait of bliss Which she knew to throw—not he to miss— She threw, till he dreamed her his. To her arts not blind, he yet sued long, As a songster jailed by a deed of wrong Will shower the doer with song; Till tried by tones now smart, now suave, He would flee in ire, to return a slave Who willingly forgave. When no! One day he left her door, “I'll ease mine agony!” he swore, “And bear this thing no more! “I'll practise a plan!” Thereon he took Her portrait from his sketching-book, And, though his pencil shook, He moulded on the real its mock; Of beauteous brow, lip, eye, and lock Composed a laughingstock. Amazed at this satire of his long lure, Whenever he scanned it he'd scarce endure His laughter. 'Twas his cure. And, even when he woke in the night, And chanced to think of the comic sight, He laughed till exhausted quite. “Why do you laugh?” she said one day As he gazed at her in a curious way. “Oh—for nothing,” said he. “Mere play.” —A gulf of years then severed the twain; Till he heard—a painter of high attain— She was dying on her domain. “And,” dryly added the friend who told, “You may know or not that, in semblance cold, She loved once, loved whole-souled; “And that you were the man? Did you break your vow? Well, well; she is good as gone by now . . . But you hit her, all allow!” Ah, the blow past bearing that he received! In his bachelor quiet he grieved and grieved; How cruel; how self-deceived! Did she ever know? . . . Men pitied his state As the curse of his own contrivance ate Like canker into his fate. For ever that thing of his evil craft Uprose on his grief—his mocking draught— Till, racked, he insanely laughed. Thence onward folk would muse in doubt What gloomed him so as he walked about, But few, or none, found out. A LEADER OF FASHION Never has she known The way a robin will skip and come, With an eye half bold, half timorsome, To the table's edge for a breakfast crumb: Nor has she seen A streak of roseate gently drawn Across the east, that means the dawn, When, up and out, she foots it on: Nor has she heard The rustle of the sparrow's tread To roost in roof-holes near her head When dusk bids her, too, seek her bed: Nor has she watched Amid a stormy eve's turmoil The pipkin slowly come to boil, In readiness for one at toil: Nor has she hearkened Through the long night-time, lone and numb, For sounds of sent-for help to come Ere the swift-sinking life succumb: Nor has she ever Held the loved-lost one on her arm, Attired with care his straightened form, As if he were alive and warm: Yea, never has she Known, seen, heard, felt, such things as these, Haps of so many in their degrees Throughout their count of calvaries! MIDNIGHT ON BEECHEN, 187? On Beechen Cliff self-commune I This night of mid-June, mute and dry; When darkness never rises higher Than Bath's dim concave, towers, and spire, Last eveglow loitering in the sky To feel the dawn, close lurking by, The while the lamps as glow-worms lie In a glade, myself their lonely eyer On Beechen Cliff: The city sleeps below. I sigh, For there dwells one, all testify, To match the maddest dream's desire: What swain with her would not aspire To walk the world, yea, sit but nigh On Beechen Cliff! THE AËROLITE I thought a germ of Consciousness Escaped on an aërolite Aions ago From some far globe, where no distress Had means to mar supreme delight; But only things abode that made The power to feel a gift uncloyed Of gladsome glow, And life unendingly displayed Emotions loved, desired, enjoyed. And that this stray, exotic germ Fell wanderingly upon our sphere, After its wingings, Quickened, and showed to us the worm That gnaws vitalities native here, And operated to unblind Earth's old-established ignorance Of stains and stingings, Which grin no griefs while not opined, But cruelly tax intelligence. “How shall we,” then the seers said, “Oust this awareness, this disease Called sense, here sown, Though good, no doubt, where it was bred, And wherein all things work to please?” Others cried: “Nay, we rather would, Since this untoward gift is sent For ends unknown, Limit its registerings to good, And hide from it all anguishment.” I left them pondering. This was how (Or so I dreamed) was waked on earth The mortal moan Begot of sentience. Maybe now Normal unwareness waits rebirth. THE PROSPECT The twigs of the birch imprint the December sky Like branching veins upon a thin old hand; I think of summer-time, yes, of last July, When she was beneath them, greeting a gathered band Of the urban and bland. Iced airs wheeze through the skeletoned hedge from the north, With steady snores, and a numbing that threatens snow, And skaters pass; and merry boys go forth To look for slides. But well, well do I know Whither I would go! December 1912. GENITRIX LAESA (MEASURE OF A SARUM SEQUENCE) Nature, through these generations You have nursed us with a patience Cruelly crossed by malversations, Marring mother-ministry To your multitudes, so blended By your processes, long-tended, And the painstaking expended On their chording tunefully. But this stuff of slowest moulding, In your fancy ever enfolding Life that rhythmic chime is holding: (Yes; so deem it you, Ladye— This “concordia discors”!)—truly, Rather, as if some imp unruly Twitched your artist-arm when newly Shaping forth your scenery! Aye. Yet seem you not to know it. Hence your world-work needs must show it Good in dream, in deed below it: (Lady, yes: so sight it we!) Thus, then, go on fondly thinking: Why should man your purblind blinking Crave to cure, when all is sinking To dissolubility? THE FADING ROSE I saw a rose, in bloom, but sad, Shedding the petals that still it had, And I heard it say: “O where is she Who used to come and muse on me? “The pruner says she comes no more Because she loves another flower, The weeder says she's tired of me Because I droop so suddenly. “Because of a sweetheart she comes not, Declares the man with the watering-pot; ‘She does not come,’ says he with the rake, ‘Because all women are fickle in make.’ “He with the spade and humorous leer Says: ‘Know, I delve elsewhere than here, Mid text-writ stones and grassy heaps, Round which a curious silence creeps. “‘She must get to you underground If any way at all be found, For, clad in her beauty, marble's kin, 'Tis there I have laid her and trod her in.’” WHEN OATS WERE REAPED That day when oats were reaped, and wheat was ripe, and barley ripening, The road-dust hot, and the bleaching grasses dry, I walked along and said, While looking just ahead to where some silent people lie: “I wounded one who's there, and now know well I wounded her: But, ah, she does not know that she wounded me!” And not an air stirred, Nor a bill of any bird; and no response accorded she. August 1913. LOUIE I am forgetting Louie the buoyant; Why not raise her phantom, too, Here in daylight With the elect one's? She will never thrust the foremost figure out of view! Mid this heat, in gauzy muslin See I Louie's life-lit brow Here in daylight By the elect one's.— Long two strangers they and far apart; such neighbours now! July 1913. “SHE OPENED THE DOOR” She opened the door of the West to me, With its loud sea-lashings, And cliff-side clashings Of waters rife with revelry. She opened the door of Romance to me, The door from a cell I had known too well, Too long, till then, and was fain to flee. She opened the door of a Love to me, That passed the wry World-welters by As far as the arching blue the lea. She opens the door of the Past to me, Its magic lights, Its heavenly heights, When forward little is to see! 1913 “WHAT'S THERE TO TELL?” (SONG) What's there to tell of the world More than is told? —Into its vortex hurled, Out of it rolled, Can we yet more of the world Find to be told? Lalla-la, lu! If some could last alive Much might be told; Yes, gladness might survive; But they go cold— Each and each late alive— All their tale told. Lalla-la, lu! There's little more of the world, Then, to be told; Had ever life unfurled Joys manifold, There had been more of the world Left to be told. Lalla-la, lalla-la, lalla-la, lu! 190?. THE HARBOUR BRIDGE From here, the quay, one looks above to mark The bridge across the harbour, hanging dark Against the day's-end sky, fair-green in glow Over and under the middle archway's bow: It draws its skeleton where the sun has set, Yea, clear from cutwater to parapet; On which mild glow, too, lines of rope and spar Trace themselves black as char. Down here in shade we hear the painters shift Against the bollards with a drowsy lift, As moved by the incoming stealthy tide. High up across the bridge the burghers glide As cut black-paper portraits hastening on In conversation none knows what upon: Their sharp-edged lips move quickly word by word To speech that is not heard. There trails the dreamful girl, who leans and stops, There presses the practical woman to the shops, There is a sailor, meeting his wife with a start, And we, drawn nearer, judge they are keeping apart. Both pause. She says: “I've looked for you. I thought We'd make it up.” Then no words can be caught. At last: “Won't you come home?” She moves still nigher: “'Tis comfortable, with a fire.” “No,” he says gloomily. “And, anyhow, I can't give up the other woman now: You should have talked like that in former days, When I was last home.” They go different ways. And the west dims, and yellow lamplights shine: And soon above, like lamps more opaline, White stars ghost forth, that care not for men's wives, Or any other lives. Weymouth. VAGRANT'S SONG (WITH AN OLD WESSEX REFRAIN) I When a dark-eyed dawn Crawls forth, cloud-drawn, And starlings doubt the night-time's close; And “three months yet,” They seem to fret, “Before we cease us slaves of snows, And sun returns To loose the burns, And this wild woe called Winter goes!”— O a hollow tree Is as good for me As a house where the back-brand “Back-brand”—the log which used to be laid at the back of a wood fire. glows! Che-hane, mother; che-hane, mother, As a house where the back-brand glows! II When autumn brings A whirr of wings Among the evergreens around, And sundry thrills About their quills Awe rooks, and misgivings abound, And the joyless pines In leaning lines Protect from gales the lower ground, O a hollow tree Is as good for me As a house of a thousand pound! Che-hane, mother; che-hane, mother, As a house of a thousand pound! FARMER DUNMAN'S FUNERAL “Bury me on a Sunday,” He said; “so as to see Poor folk there. 'Tis their one day To spare for following me.” With forethought of that Sunday, He wrote, while he was well, On ten rum-bottles one day, “Drink for my funeral.” They buried him on a Sunday, That folk should not be balked His wish, as 'twas their one day: And forty couple walked. They said: “To have it Sunday Was always his concern; His meaning being that one day He'd do us a good turn. “We must, had it been Monday, Have got it over soon, But now we gain, being Sunday, A jolly afternoon.” THE SEXTON AT LONGPUDDLE He passes down the churchyard track On his way to toll the bell; And stops, and looks at the graves around, And notes each finished and greening mound Complacently, As their shaper he, And one who can do it well, And, with a prosperous sense of his doing, Thinks he'll not lack Plenty such work in the long ensuing Futurity. For people will always die, And he will always be nigh To shape their cell. THE HARVEST-SUPPER (Circa 1850) Nell and the other maids danced their best With the Scotch-Greys in the barn; These had been asked to the harvest-feast; Red shapes amid the corn. Nell and the other maids sat in a row Within the benched barn-nook; Nell led the songs of long ago She'd learnt from never a book. She sang of the false Sir John of old, The lover who witched to win, And the parrot, and cage of glittering gold; And the other maids joined in. Then whispered to her a gallant Grey, “Dear, sing that ballet again! For a bonnier mouth in a bonnier way Has sung not anywhen!” As she loosed her lips anew there sighed To Nell through the dark barn-door The voice of her Love from the night outside, Who was buried the month before: “O Nell, can you sing ballets there, And I out here in the clay, Of lovers false of yore, nor care What you vowed to me one day! “O can you dance with soldiers bold, Who kiss when dancing's done, Your little waist within their hold, As ancient troth were none!” She cried: “My heart is pierced with a wound! There's something outside the wall That calls me forth to a greening mound: I can sing no more at all! “My old Love rises from the worms, Just as he used to be, And I must let gay gallants' arms No more encircle me!” They bore her home from the merry-making; Bad dreams disturbed her bed: “Nevermore will I dance and sing,” Mourned Nell; “and never wed!” AT A PAUSE IN A COUNTRY DANCE (MIDDLE OF LAST CENTURY) They stood at the foot of the figure, And panted: they'd danced it down through— That “Dashing White Serjeant” they loved so:— A window, uncurtained, was nigh them That end of the room. Thence in view Outside it a valley updrew, Where the frozen moon lit frozen snow: At the furthermost reach of the valley A light from a window shone low. “They are inside that window,” said she, As she looked. “They sit up there for me; And baby is sleeping there, too.” He glanced. “Yes,” he said. “Never mind, Let's foot our way up again; do! And dance down the line as before. What's the world to us, meeting once more!” “—Not much, when your husband full trusts you, And thinks the child his that I bore!” He was silent. The fiddlers six-eighted With even more passionate vigour. The pair swept again up the figure, The child's cuckoo-father and she, And the next couples threaded below, And the twain wove their way to the top Of “The Dashing White Serjeant” they loved so, Restarting: right, left, to and fro. —From the homestead, seen yon, the small glow Still adventured forth over the white, Where the child slept, unknowing who sired it, In the cradle of wicker tucked tight, And its grandparents, nodding, admired it In elbow-chairs through the slow night. ON THE PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN ABOUT TO BE HANGED Comely and capable one of our race, Posing there in your gown of grace, Plain, yet becoming; Could subtlest breast Ever have guessed What was behind that innocent face, Drumming, drumming! Would that your Causer, ere knoll your knell For this riot of passion, might deign to tell Why, since It made you Sound in the germ, It sent a worm To madden Its handiwork, when It might well Not have assayed you, Not have implanted, to your deep rue, The Clytaemnestra spirit in you, And with purblind vision Sowed a tare In a field so fair, And a thing of symmetry, seemly to view, Brought to derision! January 6, 1923. THE CHURCH AND THE WEDDING “I'll restore this old church for our marriage: I've ordered the plans: Style of wedding your choice—foot or carriage— By licence, or banns.” He restored it, as though built newly: The bishop was won To preach, who pronounced it truly A thing well done. But the wedding waits; long, long has waited; And guesswork is dumb Why those who were there to have mated Do not come. And when the nights moan like the wailings Of souls sore-tried, The folk say who pass the church-palings They hear inside Strange sounds as of anger and sadness That cut the heart's core, And shaken words bitter to madness; And then no more. THE SHIVER Five lone clangs from the house-clock nigh, And I woke with a sigh: Stars wore west like a slow tide flowing, And my lover had told yesternight of his going,— That at this gray hour he'd be hasting by, Starting betimes on a journey afar:— So, casement ajar, I eyed in the upland pasture his figure, A dim dumb speck, growing darker and bigger, Then smalling to nought where the nut-trees are. He could not bend his track to my window, he'd said, Being hurried ahead: But I wished he had tried to!—and then felt a shiver, Corpse-cold, as he sank toward the town by the river; And back I went sadly and slowly to bed. What meant my shiver while seeing him pass As a dot on the grass I surmised not then. But later I knew it When came again he; and my words outdrew it, As said he: “It's hard for your bearing, alas! “But I've seen, I have clasped, where the smart ships plough, One of far brighter brow. A sea-goddess. Shiver not. One far rarer In gifts than I find thee; yea, warmer and fairer:— I seek her again; and I love you not now.” “NOT ONLY I” Not only I Am doomed awhile to lie In this close bin with earthen sides; But the things I thought, and the songs I sang, And the hopes I had, and the passioned pang For people I knew Who passed before me, Whose memory barely abides; And the visions I drew That daily upbore me! And the joyous springs and summers, And the jaunts with blithe newcomers, And my plans and appearances; drives and rides That fanned my face to a lively red; And the grays and blues Of the far-off views, That nobody else discerned outspread; And little achievements for blame or praise; Things left undone; things left unsaid; In brief, my days! Compressed here in six feet by two, In secrecy To lie with me Till the Call shall be, Are all these things I knew, Which cannot be handed on; Strange happenings quite unrecorded, Lost to the world and disregarded, That only thinks: “Here moulders till Doom's-dawn A woman's skeleton.” SHE SAW HIM, SHE SAID “Why, I saw you with the sexton, outside the church-door, So I did not hurry me home, Thinking you'd not be come, Having something to him to say.— Yes: 'twas you, Dear, though you seemed sad, heart-sore; How fast you've got therefrom!” “I've not been out. I've watched the moon through the birch, And heard the bell toll. Yes, Like a passing soul in distress!” “—But no bell's tolled to-day?” . . . His face looked strange, like the face of him seen by the church, And she sank to musefulness. ONCE AT SWANAGE The spray sprang up across the cusps of the moon, And all its light loomed green As a witch-flame's weirdsome sheen At the minute of an incantation scene; And it greened our gaze—that night at demilune. Roaring high and roaring low was the sea Behind the headland shores: It symboled the slamming of doors, Or a regiment hurrying over hollow floors. . . . And there we two stood, hands clasped; I and she! THE FLOWER'S TRAGEDY In the bedchamber window, near the glass, Stood the little flower in the little vase, Unnoticed quite For a whole fortnight, And withered for lack of watering To a skeleton mere—a mummied thing. But it was not much, mid a world of teen, That a flower should waste in a nook unseen! One needed no thought to ascertain How it happened; that when she went in the rain To return here not, She was mindless what She had left here to perish.—Ah, well: for an hour I wished I had not found the flower! Yet it was not much. And she never had known Of the flower's fate; nor it of her own. AT THE AQUATIC SPORTS With their backs to the sea two fiddlers stand Facing the concourse on the strand, And a third man who sings. The sports proceed; there are crab-catchings; The people laugh as levity spreads; Yet these three do not turn their heads To see whence the merriment springs. They cease their music, but even then They stand as before, do those three men, Though pausing, nought to do: They never face to the seaward view To enjoy the contests, add their cheer, So wholly is their being here A business they pursue. A WATCHER'S REGRET J. E.'S STORY I slept across the front of the clock, Close to the long case-door; The hours were brought by their brazen knock To my ear as the slow nights wore. Thus did I, she being sick to death, That each hour as it belled Should wake me to rise, and learn by her breath Whether her strength still held. Yet though throughout life's midnights all I would have watched till spent For her dear sake, I missed the call Of the hour in which she went. HORSES ABOARD Horses in horsecloths stand in a row On board the huge ship that at last lets go: Whither are they sailing? They do not know, Nor what for, nor how.— They are horses of war, And are going to where there is fighting afar; But they gaze through their eye-holes unwitting they are, And that in some wilderness, gaunt and ghast, Their bones will bleach ere a year has passed, And the item be as “war-waste” classed.— And when the band booms, and the folk say “Good-bye!” And the shore slides astern, they appear wrenched awry From the scheme Nature planned for them,—wondering why. THE HISTORY OF AN HOUR Vain is the wish to try rhyming it, writing it! Pen cannot weld into words what it was; Time will be squandered in toil at inditing it; Clear is the cause! Yea, 'twas too satiate with soul, too ethereal; June-morning scents of a rose-bush in flower Catch in a clap-net of hempen material; So catch that hour! THE MISSED TRAIN How I was caught Hieing home, after days of allure, And forced to an inn—small, obscure— At the junction, gloom-fraught. How civil my face To get them to chamber me there— A roof I had scorned, scarce aware That it stood at the place. And how all the night I had dreams of the unwitting cause Of my lodgment. How lonely I was; How consoled by her sprite! Thus onetime to me . . . Dim wastes of dead years bar away Then from now. But such happenings to-day Fall to lovers, may be! Years, years as shoaled seas, Truly, stretch now between! Less and less Shrink the visions then vast in me.—Yes, Then in me: Now in these. UNDER HIGH-STOY HILL Four climbed High-Stoy from Ivelwards, Where hedge meets hedge, and cart-ruts wind, Chattering like birds, And knowing not what lay behind. We laughed beneath the moonlight blink, Said supper would be to our mind, And did not think Of Time, and what might lie behind. . . . The moon still meets that tree-tipped height, The road—as then—still trails inclined; But since that night We have well learnt what lay behind! For all of the four then climbing here But one are ghosts, and he brow-lined; With him they fare, Yet speak not of what lies behind. AT THE MILL O Miller Knox, whom we knew well, And the mill, and the floury floors, And the corn,—and those two women, And infants—yours! The sun was shining when you rode To market on that day: The sun was set when home-along You ambled in the gray, And gathered what had taken place While you were away. O Miller Knox, 'twas grief to see Your good wife hanging there By her own rash and passionate hand, In a throe of despair; And those two children, one by her, And one by the waiting-maid, Borne the same hour, and you afar, And she past aid. And though sometimes you walk of nights, Sleepless, to Yalbury Brow, And glance the graveyard way, and grunt, “'Twas not much, anyhow: She shouldn't ha' minded!” nought it helps To say that now. And the water dribbles down your wheel, Your mead blooms green and gold, And birds 'twit in your apple-boughs Just as of old. ALIKE AND UNLIKE (GREAT-ORME'S HEAD) We watched the selfsame scene on that long drive, Saw the magnificent purples, as one eye, Of those near mountains; saw the storm arrive; Laid up the sight in memory, you and I, As if for joint recallings by and by. But our eye-records, like in hue and line, Had superimposed on them, that very day, Gravings on your side deep, but slight on mine!— Tending to sever us thenceforth alway; Mine commonplace; yours tragic, gruesome, gray. THE THING UNPLANNED The white winter sun struck its stroke on the bridge, The meadow-rills rippled and gleamed As I left the thatched post-office, just by the ridge, And dropped in my pocket her long tender letter, With: “This must be snapped! it is more than it seemed; And now is the opportune time!” But against what I willed worked the surging sublime Of the thing that I did—the thing better! THE SHEEP-BOY A yawning, sunned concave Of purple, spread as an ocean wave Entroughed on a morning of swell and sway After a night when wind-fiends have been heard to rave: Thus was the Heath called “Draäts,” on an August day. Suddenly there intunes a hum: This side, that side, it seems to come. From the purple in myriads rise the bees With consternation mid their rapt employ. So headstrongly each speeds him past, and flees, As to strike the face of the shepherd-boy. Awhile he waits, and wonders what they mean; Till none is left upon the shagged demesne. To learn what ails, the sheep-boy looks around; Behind him, out of the sea in swirls Flexuous and solid, clammy vapour-curls Are rolling over Pokeswell Hills to the inland ground, Into the heath they sail, And travel up the vale Like the moving pillar of cloud raised by the Israelite:— In a trice the lonely sheep-boy seen so late ago, Draäts'-Hollow in gorgeous blow, And Kite-Hill's regal glow, Are viewless—folded into those creeping scrolls of white. On Rainbarrows. RETTY'S PHASES I Retty used to shake her head, Look with wicked eye; Say, “I'd tease you, simple Ned, If I cared to try!” Then she'd hot-up scarlet red, Stilly step away, Much afraid that what she'd said Sounded bold to say. II Retty used to think she loved (Just a little) me. Not untruly, as it proved Afterwards to be. For, when weakness forced her rest If we walked a mile, She would whisper she was blest By my clasp awhile. III Retty used at last to say When she neared the Vale, “Mind that you, Dear, on that day Ring my wedding peal!” And we all, with pulsing pride, Vigorous sounding gave Those six bells, the while outside John filled in her grave. IV Retty used to draw me down To the turfy heaps, Where, with yeoman, squire, and clown Noticeless she sleeps. Now her silent slumber-place Seldom do I know, For when last I saw her face Was so long ago! From an old draft of 1868. In many villages it was customary after the funeral of an unmarried young woman to ring a peal as for her wedding while the grave was being filled in, as if Death were not to be allowed to balk her of bridal honours. Young unmarried men were always her bearers. A POOR MAN AND A LADY We knew it was not a valid thing, And only sanct in the sight of God (To use your phrase), as with fervent nod You swore your assent when I placed the ring On your pale slim hand. Our whispering Was soft as the fan of a turtledove That round our heads might have seemed to wing; So solemn were we; so sincere our love. We could do no better; and thus it stood Through a time of timorous secret bliss, Till we were divided, and never a kiss Of mine could touch you, or likelihood Illumed our sky that we might, or should Be each to each in the world's wide eye What we were unviewed; and our vows make good In the presence of parents and standers by. I was a striver with deeds to do, And little enough to do them with, And a comely woman of noble kith, With a courtly match to make, were you; And we both were young; and though sterling-true You had proved to our pledge under previous strains, Our “union,” as we called it, grew Less grave to your eyes in your town campaigns. Well: the woeful neared, you needn't be told: The current news-sheets clarioned soon That you would be wived on a summer noon By a man of illustrious line and old: Nor better nor worse than the manifold Of marriages made, had there not been Our faith-swearing when fervent-souled, Which, to me, seemed a breachless bar between. We met in a Mayfair church, alone: (The request was mine, which you yielded to.) “But we were not married at all!” urged you: “Why, of course we were!” I said. Your tone, I noted, was world-wise. You went on: “'Twas sweet while it lasted. But you well know That law is law. He'll be, anon, My husband really. You, Dear, weren't so.” “I wished—but to learn if—” faltered I, And stopped. “But I'll sting you not. Farewell!” And we parted.—Do you recall the bell That tolled by chance as we said good-bye? . . . I saw you no more. The track of a high, Sweet, liberal lady you've doubtless trod. —All's past! No heart was burst thereby, And no one knew, unless it was God. The foregoing was intended to preserve an episode in the story of “The Poor Man and the Lady,” written in 1868, and, like these lines, in the first person; but never printed, and ultimately destroyed. AN EXPOSTULATION Why want to go afar Where pitfalls are, When all we swains adore Your featness more and more As heroine of our artless masquings here, And count few Wessex' daughters half so dear? Why paint your appealing face, When its born grace Is such no skill can match With powder, puff, or patch, Whose every touch defames your bloomfulness, And with each stain increases our distress? Yea, is it not enough That (rare or rough Your lines here) all uphold you, And as with wings enfold you, But you must needs desert the kine-cropt vale Wherein your foredames gaily filled the pail? TO A SEA-CLIFF (DURLSTON HEAD) Lend me an ear While I read you here A page from your history, Old cliff—not known To your solid stone, Yet yours inseparably. Near to your crown There once sat down A silent listless pair; And the sunset ended, And dark descended, And still the twain sat there. Past your jutting head Then a line-ship sped, Lit brightly as a city; And she sobbed: “There goes A man who knows I am his, beyond God's pity!” He slid apart Who had thought her heart His own, and not aboard A bark, sea-bound. . . . That night they found Between them lay a sword. THE ECHO-ELF ANSWERS How much shall I love her? For life, or not long? “Not long.” Alas! When forget her? In years, or by June? “By June.” And whom woo I after? No one, or a throng? “A throng.” Of these shall I wed one Long hence, or quite soon? “Quite soon.” And which will my bride be? The right or the wrong? “The wrong.” And my remedy—what kind? Wealth-wove, or earth-hewn? “Earth-hewn.” CYNIC'S EPITAPH A race with the sun as he downed I ran at evetide, Intent who should first gain the ground And there hide. He beat me by some minutes then, But I triumphed anon, For when he'd to rise up again I stayed on. A BEAUTY'S SOLILOQUY DURING HER HONEYMOON Too late, too late! I did not know my fairness Would catch the world's keen eyes so! How the men look at me! My radiant rareness I deemed not they would prize so! That I was a peach for any man's possession Why did not some one say Before I leased myself in an hour's obsession To this dull mate for aye! His days are mine. I am one who cannot steal her Ahead of his plodding pace: As he is, so am I. One doomed to feel her A wasted form and face! I was so blind! It did sometimes just strike me All girls were not as I, But, dwelling much alone, how few were like me I could not well descry; Till, at this Grand Hotel, all looks bend on me In homage as I pass To take my seat at breakfast, dinner,—con me As poorly spoused, alas! I was too young. I dwelt too much on duty: If I had guessed my powers Where might have sailed this cargo of choice beauty In its unanchored hours! Well, husband, poor plain man; I've lost life's battle!— Come—let them look at me. O damn, don't show in your looks that I'm your chattel Quite so emphatically! In a London Hotel, 1892. DONAGHADEE (SONG) I've never gone to Donaghadee, That vague far townlet by the sea; In Donaghadee I shall never be: Then why do I sing of Donaghadee, That I know not in a faint degree? . . . —Well, once a woman wrote to me With a tender pen from Donaghadee. “Susan,” I've sung, “Pride of Kildare,” Because I'd heard of a Susan there, The “Irish Washerwoman's” capers I've shared for hours to midnight tapers, And “Kitty O'Linch” has made me spin Till dust rose high, and day broke in: That other “Kitty, of Coleraine,” Too, set me aching in heart and brain: While “Kathleen Mavourneen,” of course, would ring When that girl learnt to make me sing. Then there was “Irish Molly O” I tuned as “the fairest one I know,” And “Nancy Dawson,” if I remember, Rhymed sweet in moonlight one September. But the damsel who once wrote so free And tender-toned from Donaghadee, Is a woman who has no name for me— Moving sylph-like, mysteriously, (For doubtless, of that sort is she) In the pathways of her destiny; But that is where I never shall be;— And yet I sing of Donaghadee! HE INADVERTENTLY CURES HIS LOVE-PAINS (SONG) I said: “O let me sing the praise Of her who sweetly racks my days,— Her I adore; Her lips, her eyes, her moods, her ways!” In miseries of pulse and pang I strung my harp, and straightway sang As none before:— To wondrous words my quavers rang! Thus I let heartaches lilt my verse, Which suaged and soothed, and made disperse The smarts I bore To stagnance like a sepulchre's. But, eased, the days that thrilled ere then Lost value; and I ask, O when, And how, restore Those old sweet agonies again! THE PEACE PEAL (AFTER FOUR YEARS OF SILENCE) Said a wistful daw in Saint Peter's tower, High above Casterbridge slates and tiles, “Why do the walls of my Gothic bower Shiver, and shrill out sounds for miles? This gray old rubble Has scorned such din Since I knew trouble And joy herein. How still did abide them These bells now swung, While our nest beside them Securely clung! . . . It means some snare For our feet or wings; But I'll be ware Of such baleful things!” And forth he flew from his louvred niche To take up life in a damp dark ditch. —So mortal motives are misread, And false designs attributed, In upper spheres of straws and sticks, Or lower, of pens and politics. At the end of the War. LADY VI There goes the Lady Vi. How well, How well I know the spectacle The earth presents And its events To her sweet sight Each day and night! “Life is a wheeling show, with me As its pivot of interest constantly. Below in the hollows of towns is sin, Like a blue brimstone mist therein, Which makes men lively who plunge amid it, But wrongfully, and wives forbid it. London is a place for prancing Along the Row and, later, dancing Till dawn, with tightening arm-embowments As hours warm up to tender moments. “Travel is piquant, and most thrilling If, further, joined to big-game killing: At home, too, hunting, hounds full cry, When Reynard nears his time to die, 'Tis glee to mark his figure flag, And how his brush begins to drag, Till, his earth reached by many a wend, He finds it stopped, and meets his end. “Religion is good for all who are meek; It stays in the Bible through the week, And floats about the house on Sundays, But does not linger on till Mondays. The ten Commandments in one's prime Are matter for another time, While griefs and graves and things allied In well-bred talk one keeps outside.” A POPULAR PERSONAGE AT HOME “I live here: ‘Wessex’ is my name: I am a dog known rather well: I guard the house; but how that came To be my whim I cannot tell. “With a leap and a heart elate I go At the end of an hour's expectancy To take a walk of a mile or so With the folk I let live here with me. “Along the path, amid the grass I sniff, and find out rarest smells For rolling over as I pass The open fields towards the dells. “No doubt I shall always cross this sill, And turn the corner, and stand steady, Gazing back for my mistress till She reaches where I have run already, “And that this meadow with its brook, And bulrush, even as it appears As I plunge by with hasty look, Will stay the same a thousand years.” Thus “Wessex.” But a dubious ray At times informs his steadfast eye, Just for a trice, as though to say, “Yet, will this pass, and pass shall I?” 1924. INSCRIPTIONS FOR A PEAL OF EIGHT BELLS AFTER A RESTORATION I Thomas Tremble new-made me Eighteen hundred and fifty-three: Why he did I fail to see. II I was well-toned by William Brine, Seventeen hundred and twenty-nine; Now, re-cast, I weakly whine! III Fifteen hundred used to be My date, but since they melted me 'Tis only eighteen fifty-three. IV Henry Hopkins got me made, And I summon folk as bade; Not to much purpose, I'm afraid! V I likewise; for I bang and bid In commoner metal than I did, Some of me being stolen and hid. VI I, too, since in a mould they flung me, Drained my silver, and rehung me, So that in tin-like tones I tongue me. VII In nineteen hundred, so 'tis said, They cut my canon off my head, And made me look scalped, scraped, and dead. VIII I'm the peal's tenor still, but rue it! Once it took two to swing me through it: Now I'm rehung, one dolt can do it. A REFUSAL Said the grave Dean of Westminster: Mine is the best minster Seen in Great Britain, As many have written: So therefore I cannot Rule here if I ban not Such liberty-taking As movements for making Its grayness environ The memory of Byron, Which some are demanding Who think them of standing, But in my own viewing Require some subduing For tendering suggestions On Abbey-wall questions That must interfere here With my proper sphere here, And bring to disaster This fane and its master, Whose dict is but Christian Though nicknamed Philistian. A lax Christian charity— No mental clarity Ruling its movements For fabric improvements— Demands admonition And strict supervision When bent on enshrining Rapscallions, and signing Their names on God's stonework, As if like His own work Were their lucubrations: And passed is my patience That such a creed-scorner (Not mentioning horner) Should claim Poet's Corner. 'Tis urged that some sinners Are here for worms' dinners Already in person; That he could not worsen The walls by a name mere With men of such fame here. Yet nay; they but leaven The others in heaven In just true proportion, While more mean distortion. 'Twill next be expected That I get erected To Shelley a tablet In some niche or gablet. Then—what makes my skin burn, Yea, forehead to chin burn— That I ensconce Swinburne! August 1924. EPITAPH ON A PESSIMIST I'm Smith of Stoke, aged sixty-odd, I've lived without a dame From youth-time on; and would to God My dad had done the same. From the French and Greek. THE PROTEAN MAIDEN (SONG) This single girl is two girls: How strange such things should be! One noon eclipsed by few girls, The next no beauty she. And daily cries the lover, In voice and feature vext: “My last impression of her Is never to be the next! “She's plain: I will forget her! She's turned to fair. Ah no, Forget?—not I! I'll pet her With kisses swift and slow.” A WATERING-PLACE LADY INVENTORIED A sweetness of temper unsurpassed and unforgettable, A mole on the cheek whose absence would have been regrettable, A ripple of pleasant converse full of modulation, A bearing of inconveniences without vexation, Till a cynic would find her amiability provoking, Tempting him to indulge in mean and wicked joking. Flawlessly oval of face, especially cheek and chin, With a glance of a quality that beckoned for a glance akin, A habit of swift assent to any intelligence broken, Before the fact to be conveyed was fully spoken And she could know to what her colloquist would win her,— This from a too alive impulsion to sympathy in her,— All with a sense of the ridiculous, keen yet charitable; In brief, a rich, profuse attractiveness unnarratable. I should have added her hints that her husband prized her but slenderly, And that (with a sigh) 'twas a pity she'd no one to treat her tenderly. THE SEA FIGHT 31 May: 1916 IN MEMORIAM CAPTAIN PROWSE Down went the grand “Queen Mary,” “Queen Mary's” captain, and her crew; The brunt of battle bare he, And he died; And he died, as heroes do. More really now we view him, More really lives he, moves with men, Than while on earth we knew him As our fellow, As our fellow-denizen. Maybe amid the changes Of ocean's caverned dim profound, Gaily his spirit ranges With his comrades, With his comrades all around. 1916. PARADOX (M. H.) Though out of sight now, and as 'twere not the least to us; Comes she in sorrows, as one bringing peace to us? Lost to each meadow, each hill-top, each tree around, Yet the whole truth may her largened sight see around? Always away from us She may not stray from us! Can she, then, know how men's fatings befall? Yea indeed, may know well; even know thereof all. THE ROVER COME HOME He's journeyed through America From Canso Cape to Horn, And from East Indian Comorin To Behring's Strait forlorn; He's felled trees in the backwoods, In swamps has gasped for breath; In Tropic heats, in Polar ice, Has often prayed for death. He has fought and bled in civil wars Of no concern to him, Has shot his fellows—beasts and men— At risk of life and limb. He has suffered fluxes, fevers. Agues, and ills allied, And now he's home. You look at him As he talks by your fireside. And what is written in his glance Stressed by such foreign wear, After such alien circumstance What does his face declare? His mother's; she who saw him not After his starting year, Who never left her native spot, And lies in the churchyard near. “KNOWN HAD I” (SONG) Known had I what I knew not When we met eye to eye, That thenceforth I should view not Again beneath the sky So truefooted a farer As you who faced me then, My path had been a rarer Than it figures among men! I would have trod beside you To guard your feet all day, And borne at night to guide you A lantern on your way: Would not have left you lonely With wringing doubt, to cow Old hope, if I could only Have known what I know now. THE PAT OF BUTTER Once, at the Agricultural Show, We tasted—all so yellow— Those butter-pats, cool and mellow! Each taste I still remember, though It was so long ago. This spoke of the grass of Netherhay, And this of Kingcomb Hill, And this of Coker Rill: Which was the prime I could not say Of all those tried that day, Till she, the fair and wicked-eyed, Held out a pat to me: Then felt I all Yeo-Lea Was by her sample sheer outvied; And, “This is the best,” I cried. BAGS OF MEAT “Here's a fine bag of meat,” Says the master-auctioneer, As the timid, quivering steer, Starting a couple of feet At the prod of a drover's stick, And trotting lightly and quick, A ticket stuck on his rump, Enters with a bewildered jump. “Where he's lived lately, friends, I'd live till lifetime ends: They've a whole life everyday Down there in the Vale, have they! He'd be worth the money to kill And give away Christmas for good-will.” “Now here's a heifer—worth more Than bid, were she bone-poor; Yet she's round as a barrel of beer”; “She's a plum,” said the second auctioneer. “Now this young bull—for thirty pound? Worth that to manure your ground!” “Or to stand,” chimed the second one, “And have his picter done!” The beast was rapped on the horns and snout To make him turn about. “Well,” cried a buyer, “another crown— Since I've dragged here from Taunton Town!” “That calf, she sucked three cows, Which is not matched for bouse In the nurseries of high life By the first-born of a nobleman's wife!” The stick falls, meaning, “A true tale's told,” On the buttock of the creature sold, And the buyer leans over and snips His mark on one of the animal's hips. Each beast, when driven in, Looks round at the ring of bidders there With a much-amazed reproachful stare, As at unnatural kin, For bringing him to a sinister scene So strange, unhomelike, hungry, mean; His fate the while suspended between A butcher, to kill out of hand, And a farmer, to keep on the land; One can fancy a tear runs down his face When the butcher wins, and he's driven from the place. THE SUNDIAL ON A WET DAY I drip, drip here In Atlantic rain, Falling like handfuls Of winnowed grain, Which, tear-like, down My gnomon drain, And dim my numerals With their stain,— Till I feel useless, And wrought in vain! And then I think In my despair That, though unseen, He is still up there, And may gaze out Anywhen, anywhere; Not to help clockmen Quiz and compare, But in kindness to let me My trade declare. St. Juliot. HER HAUNTING-GROUND Can it be so? It must be so, That visions have not ceased to be In this the chiefest sanctuary Of her whose form we used to know. —Nay, but her dust is far away, And “where her dust is, shapes her shade, If spirit clings to flesh,” they say: Yet here her life-parts most were played! Her voice explored this atmosphere, Her foot impressed this turf around, Her shadow swept this slope and mound, Her fingers fondled blossoms here; And so, I ask, why, why should she Haunt elsewhere, by a slighted tomb, When here she flourished sorrow-free, And, save for others, knew no gloom? A PARTING-SCENE The two pale women cried, But the man seemed to suffer more, Which he strove hard to hide. They stayed in the waiting-room, behind the door, Till startled by the entering engine-roar, As if they could not bear to have unfurled Their misery to the eyes of all the world. A soldier and his young wife Were the couple; his mother the third, Who had seen the seams of life. He was sailing for the East I later heard. —They kissed long, but they did not speak a word; Then, strained, he went. To the elder the wife in tears “Too long; too long!” burst out. ('Twas for five years.) SHORTENING DAYS AT THE HOMESTEAD The first fire since the summer is lit, and is smoking into the room: The sun-rays thread it through, like woof-lines in a loom. Sparrows spurt from the hedge, whom misgivings appal That winter did not leave last year for ever, after all. Like shock-headed urchins, spiny-haired, Stand pollard willows, their twigs just bared. Who is this coming with pondering pace, Black and ruddy, with white embossed, His eyes being black, and ruddy his face And the marge of his hair like morning frost? It's the cider-maker, And appletree-shaker, And behind him on wheels, in readiness, His mill, and tubs, and vat, and press. DAYS TO RECOLLECT Do you recall That day in Fall When we walked towards Saint Alban's Head, On thistledown that summer had shed, Or must I remind you? Winged thistle-seeds which hitherto Had lain as none were there, or few, But rose at the brush of your petticoat-seam (As ghosts might rise of the recent dead), And sailed on the breeze in a nebulous stream Like a comet's tail behind you: You don't recall That day in Fall? Then do you remember That sad November When you left me never to see me more, And looked quite other than theretofore, As if it could not be you? And lay by the window whence you had gazed So many times when blamed or praised, Morning or noon, through years and years, Accepting the gifts that Fortune bore, Sharing, enduring, joys, hopes, fears! Well: I never more did see you.— Say you remember That sad November! TO C. F. H. ON HER CHRISTENING-DAY Fair Caroline, I wonder what You think of earth as a dwelling-spot, And if you'd rather have come, or not? To-day has laid on you a name That, though unasked for, you will claim Lifelong, for love or praise or blame. May chance and change impose on you No heavier burthen than this new Care-chosen one your future through! Dear stranger here, the prayer is mine That your experience may combine Good things with glad. . . . Yes, Caroline! THE HIGH-SCHOOL LAWN Gray prinked with rose, White tipped with blue, Shoes with gay hose, Sleeves of chrome hue; Fluffed frills of white, Dark bordered light; Such shimmerings through Trees of emerald green are eyed This afternoon, from the road outside. They whirl around: Many laughters run With a cascade's sound; Then a mere one. A bell: they flee: Silence then:— So it will be Some day again With them,—with me. THE FORBIDDEN BANNS A BALLAD OF THE EIGHTEEN-THIRTIES I “O what's the gain, my worthy Sir, In stopping the banns to-day! Your son declares he'll marry her If a thousand folk say Nay.” “I'll do't; I'll do't; whether or no! And, if I drop down dead, To church this morning I will go, And say they shall not wed!” That day the parson clear outspoke The maid's name and the man's: His father, mid the assembled folk, Said, “I forbid the banns!” Then, white in face, lips pale and cold, He turned him to sit down, When he fell forward; and behold, They found his life had flown. II 'Twas night-time, towards the middle part, When low her husband said, “I would from the bottom of my heart That father was not dead!” She turned from one to the other side, And a sad woman was she As he went on: “He'd not have died Had it not been for me!” She brought him soon an idiot child, And then she brought another: His face waned wan, his manner wild With hatred of their mother. “Hearken to me, my son. No: no: There's madness in her blood!” Those were his father's words; and lo, Now, now he understood. What noise is that? One noise, and two Resound from a near gun. Two corpses found: and neighbours knew By whom the deed was done. THE PAPHIAN BALL ANOTHER CHRISTMAS EXPERIENCE OF THE MELLSTOCK QUIRE We went our Christmas rounds once more, With quire and viols as therefore. Our path was near by Rushy-Pond, Where Egdon-Heath outstretched beyond. There stood a figure against the moon, Tall, spare, and humming a weirdsome tune. “You tire of Christian carols,” he said: “Come and lute at a ball instead. “'Tis to your gain, for it ensures That many guineas will be yours. “A slight condition hangs on't, true, But you will scarce say nay thereto: “That you go blindfold; that anon The place may not be gossiped on.” They stood and argued with each other: “Why sing from one house to another “These ancient hymns in the freezing night, And all for nought? 'Tis foolish, quite!” “—'Tis serving God, and shunning evil: Might not elsedoing serve the devil?” “But grand pay!” . . . They were lured by his call, Agreeing to go blindfold all. They walked, he guiding, some new track, Doubting to find the pathway back. In a strange hall they found them when They were unblinded all again. Gilded alcoves, great chandeliers, Voluptuous paintings ranged in tiers, In brief, a mansion large and rare, With rows of dancers waiting there. They tuned and played; the couples danced; Half-naked women tripped, advanced, With handsome partners footing fast, Who swore strange oaths, and whirled them past. And thus and thus the slow hours wore them: While shone their guineas heaped before them. Drowsy at length, in lieu of the dance “While Shepherds watched . . .” they bowed by chance; And in a moment, at a blink, There flashed a change; ere they could think The ball-room vanished and all its crew: Only the well-known heath they view— The spot of their crossing overnight, When wheedled by the stranger's sleight. There, east, the Christmas dawn hung red, And dark Rainbarrow with its dead Bulged like a supine negress' breast Against Clyffe-Clump's faint far-off crest. Yea; the rare mansion, gorgeous, bright, The ladies, gallants, gone were quite. The heaped-up guineas, too, were gone With the gold table they were on. “Why did not grasp we what was owed!” Cried some, as homeward, shamed, they strode. Now comes the marvel and the warning: When they had dragged to church next morning, With downcast heads and scarce a word, They were astound at what they heard. Praises from all came forth in showers For how they'd cheered the midnight hours. “We've heard you many times,” friends said, “But like that never have you played! “Rejoice, ye tenants of the earth, And celebrate your Saviour's birth “Never so thrilled the darkness through, Or more inspired us so to do!” . . . —The man who used to tell this tale Was the tenor-viol, Michael Mail; Yes; Mail the tenor, now but earth!— I give it for what it may be worth. ON MARTOCK MOOR I My deep-dyed husband trusts me, He feels his mastery sure, Although I leave his evening hearth To walk upon the moor. II —I had what wealth I needed, And of gay gowns a score, And yet I left my husband's house To muse upon the moor. III O how I loved a dear one Who, save in soul, was poor! O how I loved the man who met Me nightly on the moor. IV I'd feather-beds and couches, And carpets for the floor, Yet brighter to me was, at eves, The bareness of the moor. V There was a dogging figure, There was a hiss of “Whore!” There was a flounce at Weir-water One night upon the moor. . . . VI Yet do I haunt there, knowing By rote each rill's low pour, But only a fitful phantom now Meets me upon the moor. 1899. THAT MOMENT The tragedy of that moment Was deeper than the sea, When I came in that moment And heard you speak to me! What I could not help seeing Covered life as a blot; Yes, that which I was seeing, And knew that you were not PREMONITIONS “The bell went heavy to-day At afternoon service, they say, And a screech-owl cried in the boughs, And a raven flew over the house, And Betty's old clock with one hand, That's worn out, as I understand, And never goes now, never will, Struck twelve when the night was dead still, Just as when my last loss came to me. . . . Ah! I wonder who next it will be!” THIS SUMMER AND LAST Unhappy summer you, Who do not see What your yester-summer saw! Never, never will you be Its match to me, Never, never draw Smiles your forerunner drew, Know what it knew! Divine things done and said Illumined it, Whose rays crept into corn-brown curls, Whose breezes heard a humorous wit Of fancy flit.— Still the alert brook purls, Though feet that there would tread Elsewhere have sped. So, bran-new summer, you Will never see All that yester-summer saw! Never, never will you be In memory Its rival, never draw Smiles your forerunner drew, Know what it knew! 1913? “NOTHING MATTERS MUCH” (B. F. L.) “Nothing matters much,” he said Of something just befallen unduly: He, then active, but now dead, Truly, truly! He knew the letter of the law As voiced by those of wig and gown, Whose slightest syllogistic flaw He hammered down. And often would he shape in word That nothing needed much lamenting; And she who sat there smiled and heard, Sadly assenting. Facing the North Sea now he lies, Toward the red altar of the East, The Flamborough roar his psalmodies, The wind his priest. And while I think of his bleak bed, Of Time that builds, of Time that shatters, Lost to all thought is he, who said “Nothing much matters.” IN THE EVENING IN MEMORIAM FREDERICI TREVES, 1853–1923 (Dorchester Cemetery, Jan. 2, 1924) In the evening, when the world knew he was dead, He lay amid the dust and hoar Of ages; and to a spirit attending said: “This chalky bed?— I surely seem to have been here before?” “O yes. You have been here. You knew the place, Substanced as you, long ere your call; And if you cared to do so you might trace In this gray space Your being, and the being of men all.” Thereto said he: “Then why was I called away? I knew no trouble or discontent: Why did I not prolong my ancient stay Herein for aye?” The spirit shook its head. “None knows: you went. “And though, perhaps, Time did not sign to you The need to go, dream-vision sees How Aesculapius' phantom hither flew, With Galen's, too, And his of Cos—plague-proof Hippocrates, “And beckoned you forth, whose skill had read as theirs, Maybe, had Science chanced to spell In their day, modern modes to stem despairs That mankind bears! . . . Enough. You have returned. And all is well.” THE SIX BOARDS Six boards belong to me: I do not know where they may be; If growing green, or lying dry In a cockloft nigh. Some morning I shall claim them, And who may then possess will aim them To bring to me those boards I need With thoughtful speed. But though they hurry so To yield me mine, I shall not know How well my want they'll have supplied When notified. Those boards and I—how much In common we, of feel and touch Shall share thence on,—earth's far core-quakings, Hill-shocks, tide-shakings— Yea, hid where none will note, The once live tree and man, remote From mundane hurt as if on Venus, Mars, Or furthest stars. BEFORE MY FRIEND ARRIVED I sat on the eve-lit weir, Which gurgled in sobs and sighs; I looked across the meadows near To the towered church on the rise. Overmuch cause had my look! I pulled out pencil and book, And drew a white chalk mound, Outthrown on the sepulchred ground. Why did I pencil that chalk? It was fetched from the waiting grave, And would return there soon, Of one who had stilled his walk And sought oblivion's cave. He was to come on the morrow noon And take a good rest in the bed so hewn. He came, and there he is now, although This was a wondrous while ago. And the sun still dons a ruddy dye; The weir still gurgles nigh; The tower is dark on the sky. COMPASSION AN ODE In Celebration of the Centenary of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals I Backward among the dusky years A lonesome lamp is seen arise, Lit by a few fain pioneers Before incredulous eyes.— We read the legend that it lights: “Wherefore beholds this land of historied rights Mild creatures, despot-doomed, bewildered, plead Their often hunger, thirst, pangs, prisonment, In deep dumb gaze more eloquent Than tongues of widest heed?” II What was faint-written, read in a breath In that year—ten times ten away— A larger louder conscience saith More sturdily to-day.— But still those innocents are thralls To throbless hearts, near, far, that hear no calls Of honour towards their too-dependent frail, And from Columbia Cape to Ind we see How helplessness breeds tyranny In power above assail. III Cries still are heard in secret nooks, Till hushed with gag or slit or thud; And hideous dens whereon none looks Are sprayed with needless blood. But here, in battlings, patient, slow, Much has been won—more, maybe, than we know— And on we labour hopeful. “Ailinon!” A mighty voice calls: “But may the good prevail!” And “Blessed are the merciful!” Calls a yet mightier one. January 22, 1924. “WHY SHE MOVED HOUSE” (THE DOG MUSES) Why she moved house, without a word, I cannot understand; She'd mirrors, flowers, she'd book and bird, And callers in a band. And where she is she gets no sun, No flowers, no book, no glass; Of callers I am the only one. And I but pause and pass. TRAGEDIAN TO TRAGEDIENNE Shall I leave you behind me When I play In earnest what we've played in mock to-day? Why, yes; most surely shall I Leave you behind In yet full orbit, when my years upwind. I may creep off in the night-time, And none know Till comes the morning, bringing news 'tis so. Will you then turn for a moment White or red, Recall those spells of ours; things done, things said? Aye, those adventurous doings And those days Of stress, when I'd the blame and you the praise? Still you will meet adventure— None knows what— Still you will go on changing: I shall not. Still take a call at the mummings Daily or nightly, Yielding to custom, calmly, gloomily, brightly. Last, you will flag, and finish Your masquings too: Yes: end them: I not there to succour you. THE LADY OF FOREBODINGS “What do you so regret, my lady, Sitting beside me here? Are there not days as clear As this to come—ev'n shaped less shady?” “O no,” said she. “Come what delight To you, by voice or pen, To me will fall such day, such night, Not, not again!” The lamps above and round were fair, The tables were aglee, As if 'twould ever be That we should smile and sit on there. But yet she said, as though she must, “Yes: it will soon be gone, And all its dearness leave but dust To muse upon.” THE BIRD-CATCHER'S BOY “Father, I fear your trade: Surely it's wrong! Little birds limed and made Captive life-long. “Larks bruise and bleed in jail, Trying to rise; Every caged nightingale Soon pines and dies.” “Don't be a dolt, my boy! Birds must be caught; My lot is such employ, Yours to be taught. “Soft shallow stuff as that Out from your head! Just learn your lessons pat, Then off to bed.” Lightless, without a word Bedwise he fares; Groping his way is heard Seek the dark stairs Through the long passage, where Hang the caged choirs: Harp-like his fingers there Sweep on the wires. Next day, at dye of dawn, Freddy was missed: Whither the boy had gone Nobody wist. That week, the next one, whiled: No news of him: Weeks up to months were piled: Hope dwindled dim. Yet not a single night Locked they the door, Waiting, heart-sick, to sight Freddy once more. Hopping there long anon Still the birds hung: Like those in Babylon Captive, they sung. One wintry Christmastide Both lay awake; All cheer within them dried, Each hour an ache. Then some one seemed to flit Soft in below; “Freddy's come!” Up they sit, Faces aglow. Thereat a groping touch Dragged on the wires Lightly and softly—much As they were lyres; “Just as it used to be When he came in, Feeling in darkness the Stairway to win!” Waiting a trice or two Yet, in the gloom, Both parents pressed into Freddy's old room. There on the empty bed White the moon shone, As ever since they'd said, “Freddy is gone!” That night at Durdle-Door Durdle-Door, a rock on the south coast. Foundered a hoy, And the tide washed ashore One sailor boy. November 21, 1912. A HURRIED MEETING It is August moonlight in the tall plantation, Whose elms, by aged squirrels' footsteps worn, Outscreen the noon, and eve, and morn. On the facing slope a faint irradiation From a mansion's marble front is borne, Mute in its woodland wreathing. Up here the night-jar whirrs forlorn, And the trees seem to withhold their softest breathing. To the moonshade slips a woman in muslin vesture: Her naked neck the gossamer-web besmears, And she sweeps it away with a hasty gesture Again it touches her forehead, her neck, her ears, Her fingers, the backs of her hands. She sweeps it away again Impatiently, and then She takes no notice; and listens, and sighs, and stands. The night-hawk stops. A man shows in the obscure: They meet, and passively kiss, And he says: “Well, I've come quickly. About this— Is it really so? You are sure?” “I am sure. In February it will be. That such a thing should come to me! We should have known. We should have left off meeting. Love is a terrible thing: a sweet allure That ends in heart-outeating!” “But what shall we do, my Love, and how?” “You need not call me by that name now.” Then he more coldly: “What is your suggestion?” “I've told my mother, and she sees a way, Since of our marriage there can be no question. We are crossing South—near about New Year's Day The event will happen there. It is the only thing that we can dare To keep them unaware!” “Well, you can marry me.” She shook her head. “No: that can never be. “'Twill be brought home as hers. She's forty-one, When many a woman's bearing is not done, And well might have a son.— We should have left off specious self-deceiving: I feared that such might come, And knowledge struck me numb. Love is a terrible thing: witching when first begun, To end in grieving, grieving!” And with one kiss again the couple parted: Inferior clearly he; she haughty-hearted. He watched her down the slope to return to her place. The marble mansion of her ancient race, And saw her brush the gossamers from her face As she emerged from shade to the moonlight ray. And when she had gone away The night-jar seemed to imp, and say, “You should have taken warning: Love is a terrible thing: sweet for a space, And then all mourning, mourning!” DISCOURAGEMENT To see the Mother, naturing Nature, stand All racked and wrung by her unfaithful lord, Her hopes dismayed by his defiling hand, Her passioned plans for bloom and beauty marred. Where she would mint a perfect mould, an ill; Where she would don divinest hues, a stain, Over her purposed genial hour a chill, Upon her charm of flawless flesh a blain: Her loves dependent on a feature's trim, A whole life's circumstance on hap of birth, A soul's direction on a body's whim, Eternal Heaven upon a day of Earth, Is frost to flower of heroism and worth, And fosterer of visions ghast and grim. Westbourne Park Villas, 1863–7. (From old MS.) A LEAVING Knowing what it bore I watched the rain-smitten back of the car— (Brown-curtained, such as the old ones were)— When it started forth for a journey afar Into the sullen November air, And passed the glistening laurels and round the bend. I have seen many gayer vehicles turn that bend In autumn, winter, and summer air, Bearing for journeys near or afar Many who now are not, but were, But I don't forget that rain-smitten car, Knowing what it bore! SONG TO AN OLD BURDEN The feet have left the wormholed flooring, That danced to the ancient air, The fiddler, all-ignoring, Sleeps by the gray-grassed 'cello player: Shall I then foot around around around, As once I footed there! The voice is heard in the room no longer That trilled, none sweetlier, To gentle stops or stronger, Where now the dust-draped cobwebs stir: Shall I then sing again again again, As once I sang with her! The eyes that beamed out rapid brightness Have longtime found their close, The cheeks have wanned to whiteness That used to sort with summer rose: Shall I then joy anew anew anew, As once I joyed in those! O what's to me this tedious Maying, What's to me this June? O why should viols be playing To catch and reel and rigadoon? Shall I sing, dance around around around, When phantoms call the tune! “WHY DO I?” Why do I go on doing these things? Why not cease? Is it that you are yet in this world of welterings And unease, And that, while so, mechanic repetitions please? When shall I leave off doing these things?— When I hear You have dropped your dusty cloak and taken you wondrous wings To another sphere, Where no pain is: Then shall I hush this dinning gear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WINTER WORDS IN VARIOUS MOODS AND METRES THE NEW DAWN'S BUSINESS What are you doing outside my walls, O Dawn of another day? I have not called you over the edge Of the heathy ledge, So why do you come this way, With your furtive footstep without sound here, And your face so deedily gray? “I show a light for killing the man Who lives not far from you, And for bringing to birth the lady's child, Nigh domiciled, And for earthing a corpse or two, And for several other such odd jobs round here That Time to-day must do. “But you he leaves alone (although, As you have often said, You are always ready to pay the debt You don't forget You owe for board and bed): The truth is, when men willing are found here He takes those loth instead.” PROUD SONGSTERS The thrushes sing as the sun is going, And the finches whistle in ones and pairs, And as it gets dark loud nightingales In bushes Pipe, as they can when April wears, As if all Time were theirs. These are brand-new birds of twelve-months' growing, Which a year ago, or less than twain, No finches were, nor nightingales, Nor thrushes, But only particles of grain, And earth, and air, and rain. THOUGHTS AT MIDNIGHT Mankind, you dismay me When shadows waylay me!— Not by your splendours Do you affray me, Not as pretenders To demonic keenness, Not by your meanness, Nor your ill-teachings, Nor your false preachings, Nor your banalities And immoralities, Nor by your daring Nor sinister bearing; But by your madnesses Capping cool badnesses, Acting like puppets Under Time's buffets; In superstitions And ambitions Moved by no wisdom, Far-sight, or system, Led by sheer senselessness And presciencelessness Into unreason And hideous self-treason. . . . God, look he on you, Have mercy upon you! Part written 25th May 1906. “I AM THE ONE” I am the one whom ringdoves see Through chinks in boughs When they do not rouse In sudden dread, But stay on cooing, as if they said: “Oh; it's only he.” I am the passer when up-eared hares, Stirred as they eat The new-sprung wheat, Their munch resume As if they thought: “He is one for whom Nobody cares.” Wet-eyed mourners glance at me As in train they pass Along the grass To a hollowed spot, And think: “No matter; he quizzes not Our misery.” I hear above: “We stars must lend No fierce regard To his gaze, so hard Bent on us thus,— Must scathe him not. He is one with us Beginning and end.” THE PROPHETESS 1 “Now shall I sing That pretty thing ‘The Mocking-Bird’?”—And sing it straight did she. I had no cause To think it was A Mocking-bird in truth that sang to me. 2 Not even the glance She threw askance Foretold to me, nor did the tune or rhyme, That the words bore A meaning more Than that they were a ditty of the time. 3 But after years Of hopes and fears, And all they bring, and all they take away, I found I had heard The Mocking-bird In person singing there to me that day. A WISH FOR UNCONSCIOUSNESS If I could but abide As a tablet on a wall, Or a hillock daisy-pied, Or a picture in a hall, And as nothing else at all, I should feel no doleful achings, I should hear no judgment-call, Have no evil dreams or wakings, No uncouth or grisly care; In a word, no cross to bear. THE BAD EXAMPLE Fie, Aphrodite, shamming you are no mother, And your maternal markings trying to smother, As you were maiden, now you love another! . . . If one like you need such pretence to noose him, Indulgence in too early fires beware you, All girls yet virgin, and have constant care you Become not staled by use as she has, ere you Meet your most-loved; lest, tumbled, you should lose him Partly from Meleager. TO LOUISA IN THE LANE Meet me again as at that time In the hollow of the lane; I will not pass as in my prime I passed at each day's wane. —Ah, I remember! To do it you will have to see Anew this sorry scene wherein you have ceased to be! But I will welcome your aspen form As you gaze wondering round And say with spectral frail alarm, “Why am I still here found? —Ah, I remember! It is through him with blitheful brow Who did not love me then, but loves and draws me now!” And I shall answer: “Sweet of eyes, Carry me with you, Dear, To where you donned this spirit-guise; It's better there than here!” —Till I remember Such is a deed you cannot do: Wait must I, till with flung-off flesh I follow you. LOVE WATCHES A WINDOW “Here in the window beaming across Is he—the lineaments like him so!— The saint whose name I do not know, With the holy robe and the cheek aglow. Here will I kneel as if worshipping God When all the time I am worshipping you, Whose Love I was— You that with me will nevermore tread anew The paradise-paths we trod!” She came to that prominent pew each day, And sat there. Zealously she came And watched her Love—looking just the same From the rubied eastern tracery-frame— The man who had quite forsaken her And followed another, it was thought.— Be't as it may, Thinner, more thin, was the lady's figure wrought By some ache, year on year. Well, now she's dead, and dead is he From whom her heart once drew delight, Whose face glowed daily, lover-bright, High in the glass before her sight. And still the face is seen as clear In the rubied eastern window-gleam As formerly; But not seen now is a passioned woman's dream Glowing beside it there. THE LOVE-LETTERS (IN MEMORIAM H. R.) I met him quite by accident In a bye-path that he'd frequent. And, as he neared, the sunset glow Warmed up the smile of pleasantry Upon his too thin face, while he Held a square packet up to me, Of what, I did not know. “Well,” said he then; “they are my old letters. Perhaps she—rather felt them fetters. . . . You see, I am in a slow decline, And she's broken off with me. Quite right To send them back, and true foresight; I'd got too fond of her! To-night I burn them—stuff of mine!” He laughed in the sun—an ache in his laughter— And went. I heard of his death soon after. AN UNKINDLY MAY A shepherd stands by a gate in a white smock-frock: He holds the gate ajar, intently counting his flock. The sour spring wind is blurting boisterous-wise, And bears on it dirty clouds across the skies; Plantation timbers creak like rusty cranes, And pigeons and rooks, dishevelled by late rains, Are like gaunt vultures, sodden and unkempt, And song-birds do not end what they attempt: The buds have tried to open, but quite failing Have pinched themselves together in their quailing. The sun frowns whitely in eye-trying flaps Through passing cloud-holes, mimicking audible taps. “Nature, you're not commendable to-day!” I think. “Better to-morrow!” she seems to say. That shepherd still stands in that white smock-frock, Unnoting all things save the counting his flock. UNKEPT GOOD FRIDAYS There are many more Good Fridays Than this, if we but knew The names, and could relate them, Of men whom rulers slew For their goodwill, and date them As runs the twelvemonth through. These nameless Christs' Good Fridays, Whose virtues wrought their end, Bore days of bonds and burning, With no man to their friend, Of mockeries, and spurning; Yet they are all unpenned. When they had their Good Fridays Of bloody sweat and strain Oblivion hides. We quote not Their dying words of pain, Their sepulchres we note not, Unwitting where they have lain. No annual Good Fridays Gained they from cross and cord, From being sawn asunder, Disfigured and abhorred, Smitten and trampled under: Such dates no hands have scored. Let be. Let lack Good Fridays These Christs of unwrit names; The world was not even worthy To taunt their hopes and aims, As little of earth, earthy, As his mankind proclaims. Good Friday, 1927. THE MOUND For a moment pause:— Just here it was; And through the thin thorn hedge, by the rays of the moon, I can see the tree in the field, and beside it the mound— Now sheeted with snow—whereon we sat that June When it was green and round, And she crazed my mind by what she coolly told— The history of her undoing, (As I saw it), but she called “comradeship,” That bred in her no rueing: And saying she'd not be bound For life to one man, young, ripe-yeared, or old, Left me—an innocent simpleton to her viewing; For, though my accompt of years outscored her own, Hers had more hotly flown. . . . We never met again by this green mound, To press as once so often lip on lip, And palter, and pause:— Yes; here it was! LIDDELL AND SCOTT ON THE COMPLETION OF THEIR LEXICON (Written after the death of Liddell in 1898. Scott had died some ten years earlier.) “Well, though it seems Beyond our dreams,” Said Liddell to Scott, “We've really got To the very end, All inked and penned Blotless and fair Without turning a hair, This sultry summer day, A.D. Eighteen hundred and forty-three. “I've often, I own, Belched many a moan At undertaking it, And dreamt forsaking it. —Yes, on to Pi, When the end loomed nigh, And friends said: ‘You've as good as done,’ I almost wished we'd not begun. Even now, if people only knew My sinkings, as we slowly drew Along through Kappa, Lambda, Mu, They'd be concerned at my misgiving, And how I mused on a College living Right down to Sigma, But feared a stigma If I succumbed, and left old Donnegan For weary freshmen's eyes to con again: And how I often, often wondered What could have led me to have blundered So far away from sound theology To dialects and etymology; Words, accents not to be breathed by men Of any country ever again!” “My heart most failed, Indeed, quite quailed,” Said Scott to Liddell, “Long ere the middle! . . . 'Twas one wet dawn When, slippers on, And a cold in the head anew, Gazing at Delta I turned and felt a Wish for bed anew, And to let supersedings Of Passow's readings In dialects go. ‘That German has read More than we!’ I said; Yea, several times did I feel so! . . . “O that first morning, smiling bland, With sheets of foolscap, quills in hand, To write ?????? and ?????, Followed by fifteen hundred pages, What nerve was ours So to back our powers, Assured that we should reach ????? While there was breath left in our bodies!” Liddell replied: “Well, that's past now; The job's done, thank God, anyhow.” “And yet it's not,” Considered Scott, “For we've to get Subscribers yet We must remember; Yes; by September.” “O Lord; dismiss that. We'll succeed. Dinner is my immediate need. I feel as hollow as a fiddle, Working so many hours,” said Liddell. CHRISTMASTIDE The rain-shafts splintered on me As despondently I strode; The twilight gloomed upon me And bleared the blank high-road. Each bush gave forth, when blown on By gusts in shower and shower, A sigh, as it were sown on In handfuls by a sower. A cheerful voice called, nigh me, “A merry Christmas, friend!”— There rose a figure by me, Walking with townward trend, A sodden tramp's, who, breaking Into thin song, bore straight Ahead, direction taking Toward the Casuals' gate. RELUCTANT CONFESSION “What did you do? Cannot you let me know?” “Don't ask! . . . 'Twas midnight, and I'd lost at cards.” “Ah. Was it crime—or seemed it to be so?” “No—not till afterwards.” “But what, then, did you do?” “Well—that was the beginning—months ago; You see, I had lost, and could not pay but—so. And there flashed from him strange and strong regards That you only see when scruples smash to shards; And thus it happened—O it rained and blew!— But I can't tell. 'Twas all so lurid in hue! And what was worst came after, when I knew What first crossed not my mind, And he has never divined!” . . . “But he must have, if he proposed it you?” “I mean, that—I got rid of what resulted In a way a woman told me I consulted: 'Tis that he does not know; Great God, it harrows me so! I did not mean to. Every night— In hell-dark dreams I see an appealing figure in white— That somehow seems A newborn child in the clothes I set to make, But left off, for my own depraved name's sake!” EXPECTATION AND EXPERIENCE “I had a holiday once,” said the woman— Her name I did not know— “And I thought that where I'd like to go, Of all the places for being jolly, And getting rid of melancholy, Would be to a good big fair: And I went. And it rained in torrents, drenching Every horse, and sheep, and yeoman, And my shoulders, face and hair; And I found that I was the single woman In the field—and looked quite odd there! Everything was spirit-quenching: I crept and stood in the lew of a wall To think, and could not tell at all What on earth made me plod there!” ARISTODEMUS THE MESSENIAN (DRAMATIC HENDECASYLLABICS) Scene: Before the Stronghold of Ithome, Messenia, 735 B.C. His daughter's lover discovered, in the disguise of a soothsayer; to whom enters Aristodemus. Aristodemus (apostrophically) Straightway let it be done! Lover Let what be done, chief? Aristodemus Who art thou that art speaking? Some sage prophet?— She, my daughter's to perish on the altar! Lover Thou called hero!—a myth thy vaunted power, If it fail to redeem thy best beloved. Aristodemus Power is nought to the matter. What the Sibyl Bids, must be! Lover But I doubt such bidding thereto. Aristodemus Nay. White lippings above the Delphic tripod Mangle never their message! And they lip such. Thriving, conquering shall Messene be forthwith— Future worthy my gift of this intact one. Yea, and who of the Aép?tids' renowned house Weigh can greater with Zeus than she my offspring? Shall these Spartiats sway to save me reavement? What is fatherhood when they march in hearing? Hark! E'en now they are here! (Marching soldiers heard afar.) Lover (after a silence) And mean you to warn her? Aristodemus Not till evening shades can cover pallor. [Exit. Lover stands motionless. Enter the daughter of Aristodemus. Daughter Ah! Thou comest to me, Love, not as earlier! Lover, as it were waking, approaches, unhoods his face, and embraces her. Why not speak to me? Lover Sweetest, thou'rt a doomed one! Daughter How? Lover Thy sacrifice by thy father waits thee— Thee, as offering for the State's salvation. Daughter Not the slaying of me? Lover Fail I to stay him— (She droops in his arms) Whereto bursts in a flame a means upon me! Daughter How? My father is mighty. Thou'rt so powerless. Lover Thus and now it adumbrates. Haste I to him, Vowing love for thee! Daughter Which he'll value wryly— Less than nought, as I know. Lover Till comes my sequel; This, to wit. Thou art got with child by me. Ay, List: the Sibylline utterance asks a virgin; So th'rt saved! Daughter But a maid's the thing I am, Love! Gods! With child I am not, but veriest virgin— Who knows surer than thou? Lover I'll make him think so, Though no man upon earth more knows its falseness, Such will I. Daughter But alas, thou canst not make him: Me he knows to the core. He'll not believe thee. Lover Then thou canst. He'll accept thy vouching, sure, Sweet, And another intact one, equal serving, Straightway find for the knife. Daughter My Love, I must not! Lover Not? And yet there is pending for thee, elsewise, Dark destruction, and all thy burning being Dungeoned in an eternal nescientness! She shudders, but weepingly shows unwillingness. Stay. I'll make the asseverance first. Thou'lt clinch it? Daughter (with white cheeks, after a pause) Be it so! . . . The Messenian army is heard going out to meet the Spartans. Lover hoods himself as Aristodemus enters from the stronghold. Aristodemus (looking strangely at his daughter) Stay you yet at the gate? The old man also? Hath indeed he disclosed the sore pronouncement? Daughter (falteringly) Sore pronouncement? And what is, sire, its substance? Messenger enters. Messenger King Euphaes is just found slain in combat: Thereby King is the Chief, Aristodemus, E'en ere falters the strife—still hard against us! Aristodemus Ha! And is it in balance yet!—The deed, then! Daughter looks at her lover, who throws off his disguise; and they go up to Aristodemus together. Who's this man? And to what tends all this feigning? Daughter He—my lover—who thinks to be my husband— O my father, thy pardon! Know a secret! Aristodemus Lover? Secret? And what? But such is nought now: Husband he nor another can be to thee, Let him think as he may! And though I meant not Death to broach till the eve, let doom be dealt now. Hark, the Spartan assays! It straight behoves me, Cost it what to my soul, to give deliverance To my country the instant. Thou, my daughter, Foremost maiden of all the maidens round us— Daughter O but save me, I pray, sire! And to that end There has now to be spoke a thing immediate, And I fain would be speaker. But I cannot! What he now will reveal, receive as vouched for! (She rushes into the castle.) Aristodemus (to lover) What means this in her? Reads she what's impending? Lover King, its meaning is much! That she's with child. Yea, By me! Hence there is called for immolation One who's what she is not—a sure-sealed virgin— If you'd haste to deliver stressed Ithome, Bulking yet overhead as though unweakened! Aristodemus sinks on to a projection of the rock, and covers his eyes. Aristodemus (brokenly) Better had she been made the purposed victim Than that this should have so befallen to save her! Foul disaster of fatherhood and home-pride! . . . Let this citadel fall; the Spartan army Trample over its dust, and enter in here! She is worse than a martyr for the State-weal, I than one of the slain. And king to-morrow! (He pauses) Tis not true! He makes as if to fall upon her lover with his sword. Lover defends himself with his dagger. Aristodemus turns to rush into the castle after his daughter. I misdoubt it! They speak falsely! [Exit Aristodemus. Lover walks up and down in strained suspense. Interval. A groan is heard. Lover is about to rush out, but re-enter Aristodemus sword in hand, now bloody. Aristodemus I have proved me her honour, shown the falsehood Ye twain both have declared me! Lover That canst not do! Aristodemus I say I have outshown it; proved her even Until death very virgin pure and spotless! Enter Attendants. Attendants (severally) Horror, horror indeed! He's ripped her up—yea, With his sword! He hath split her beauteous body To prove her maid! Aristodemus (to lover) Now diest thou for thy lying, like as she died! He turns his sword on lover, but falls from exhaustion. Lover seizes Aristodemus' sword, and is about to run him through with it; but he checks his hand, and turn the sword upon himself. (Lover dies.) EVENING SHADOWS The shadows of my chimneys stretch afar Across the plot, and on to the privet bower, And even the shadows of their smokings show, And nothing says just now that where they are They will in future stretch at this same hour, Though in my earthen cyst I shall not know. And at this time the neighbouring Pagan mound, Whose myths the Gospel news now supersede, Upon the greensward also throws its shade, And nothing says such shade will spread around Even as to-day when men will no more heed The Gospel news than when the mound was made. THE THREE TALL MEN The First Tapping “What's that tapping at night: tack, tack, In some house in the street at the back?” “O, 'tis a man who, when he has leisure, Is making himself a coffin to measure. He's so very tall that no carpenter Will make it long enough, he's in fear. His father's was shockingly short for his limb— And it made a deep impression on him.” The Second Tapping “That tapping has begun again, Which ceased a year back, or near then?” “Yes, 'tis the man you heard before Making his coffin. The first scarce done His brother died—his only one— And, being of his own height, or more, He used it for him; for he was afraid He'd not get a long enough one quick made. He's making a second now, to fit Himself when there shall be need for it. Carpenters work so by rule of thumb That they make mistakes when orders come.” The Third Tapping “It's strange, but years back, when I was here, I used to notice a tapping near; A man was making his coffin at night, And he made a second, if I am right? I have heard again the self-same tapping— Yes, late last night—or was I napping?” “O no. It's the same man. He made one Which his brother had; and a second was done— For himself, as he thought. But lately his son, As tall as he, died; aye, and as trim, And his sorrowful father bestowed it on him. And now the man is making a third, To be used for himself when he is interred.” “Many years later was brought to me News that the man had died at sea.” THE LODGING-HOUSE FUCHSIAS Mrs. Masters's fuchsias hung Higher and broader, and brightly swung, Bell-like, more and more Over the narrow garden-path, Giving the passer a sprinkle-bath In the morning. She put up with their pushful ways, And made us tenderly lift their sprays, Going to her door: But when her funeral had to pass They cut back all the flowery mass In the morning. THE WHALER'S WIFE I never pass that inn “The Ring of Bells” Without recalling what its signpost tells To recollection: A tale such as all houses yield, maybe, That ever have known of fealties, phantasy, Hate, or affection. He has come from a whaling cruise to settle down As publican in his small native town, Where his wife dwells. It is a Sunday morning; she has gone To church with others. Service still being on, He seeks “The Bells.” “Yes: she's quite thriving; very much so, they say. I don't believe in tales; 'tis not my way! I hold them stuff. But—as you press me—certainly we know He visits her once at least each week or so, Fair weather or rough. “And, after all, he's quite a gentleman, And lonely wives must friend them where they can. She'll tell you all, No doubt, when prayers are done and she comes home. I'm glad to hear your early taste to roam Begins to pall.” “I'll stroll out and await her,” then said he. Anon the congregation passed, and she Passed with the rest, Unconscious of the great surprise at hand And bounding on, and smiling—fair and bland— In her Sunday best. Straight she was told. She fainted at the news, But rallied, and was able to refuse Help to her home. There she sat waiting all day—with a look— A look of joy, it seemed, if none mistook . . . But he did not come. Time flew: her husband kept him absent still, And by slow slips the woman pined, until, Grown thin, she died— Of grief at loss of him, some would aver, But how could that be? They anyway buried her By her mother's side. And by the grave stood, at the funeral, A tall man, elderly and grave withal; Gossip grew grim: He was the same one who had been seen before; He paid, in cash, all owing; and no more Was heard of him. At the pulling down of her house, decayed and old, Many years after, was the true tale told By an ancient swain. The tall man was the father of the wife. He had beguiled her mother in maiden life, And to cover her stain, Induced to wive her one in his service bred, Who brought her daughter up as his till wed. —This the girl knew, But hid it close, to save her mother's name, Even from her seaman spouse, and ruined her fame With him, though true. THROWING A TREE NEW FOREST The two executioners stalk along over the knolls, Bearing two axes with heavy heads shining and wide, And a long limp two-handled saw toothed for cutting great boles, And so they approach the proud tree that bears the death-mark on its side. Jackets doffed they swing axes and chop away just above ground, And the chips fly about and lie white on the moss and fallen leaves; Till a broad deep gash in the bark is hewn all the way round, And one of them tries to hook upward a rope, which at last he achieves. The saw then begins, till the top of the tall giant shivers: The shivers are seen to grow greater each cut than before: They edge out the saw, tug the rope; but the tree only quivers, And kneeling and sawing again, they step back to try pulling once more. Then, lastly, the living mast sways, further sways: with a shout Job and Ike rush aside. Reached the end of its long staying powers The tree crashes downward: it shakes all its neighbours throughout, And two hundred years' steady growth has been ended in less than two hours. THE WAR-WIFE OF CATKNOLL “What crowd is this in Catknoll Street, Now I am just come home? What crowd is this in my old street, That flings me such a glance? A stretcher—and corpse? A sobering sight To greet me, when my heart is light With thoughts of coming cheer to-night Now I am back from France.” “O 'tis a woman, soldier-man, Who seem to be new come: O 'tis a woman, soldier-man, Found in the river here, Whither she went and threw her in, And now they are carrying her within: She's drowned herself for a sly sin Against her husband dear. “'A said to me, who knew her well, ‘O why was I so weak!’ 'A said to me, who knew her well, And have done all her life, With a downcast face she said to me, ‘O why did I keep company Wi' them that practised gallantry, When vowed a faithful wife!’ “‘O God, I'm driven mad!’ she said, ‘To hear he's coming back; I'm fairly driven mad!’ she said: ‘He's been two years agone, And now he'll find me in this state, And not forgive me. Had but fate Kept back his coming three months late, Nothing of it he'd known!’ “We did not think she meant so much, And said: ‘He may forgive.’ O never we thought she meant so much As to go doing this. And now she must be crowned Old English for “there must be a coroner's inquest over her.”!—so fair!— Who drew men's eyes so everywhere!— And love-letters beyond compare For coaxing to a kiss. “She kept her true a year or more Against the young men all; Yes, kept her true a year or more, And they were most to blame. There was Will Peach who plays the flute, And Waywell with the dandy suit, And Nobb, and Knight. . . . But she's been mute As to the father's name.” CONCERNING HIS OLD HOME Mood I I wish to see it never— That dismal place With cracks in its floor— I would forget it ever! Mood II To see it once, that sad And memoried place— Yes, just once more— I should be faintly glad! Mood III To see it often again— That friendly place With its green low door— I'm willing anywhen! Mood IV I'll haunt it night and day— That loveable place, With its flowers' rich store That drives regret away! HER SECOND HUSBAND HEARS HER STORY “Still, Dear, it is incredible to me That here, alone, You should have sewed him up until he died, And in this very bed. I do not see How you could do it, seeing what might betide.” “Well, he came home one midnight, liquored deep— Worse than I'd known— And lay down heavily, and soundly slept: Then, desperate driven, I thought of it, to keep Him from me when he woke. Being an adept “With needle and thimble, as he snored, click-click An hour I'd sewn, Till, had he roused, he couldn't have moved from bed, So tightly laced in sheet and quilt and tick He lay. And in the morning he was dead. “Ere people came I drew the stitches out, And thus 'twas shown To be a stroke.”—“It's a strange tale!” said he. “And this same bed?”—“Yes, here it came about.” “Well, it sounds strange—told here and now to me. “Did you intend his death by your tight lacing?” “O, that I cannot own. I could not think of else that would avail When he should wake up, and attempt embracing.”— “Well, it's a cool queer tale!” YULETIDE IN A YOUNGER WORLD We believed in highdays then, And could glimpse at night On Christmas Eve Imminent oncomings of radiant revel— Doings of delight:— Now we have no such sight. We had eyes for phantoms then, And at bridge or stile On Christmas Eve Clear beheld those countless ones who had crossed it Cross again in file:— Such has ceased longwhile! We liked divination then, And, as they homeward wound On Christmas Eve, We could read men's dreams within them spinning Even as wheels spin round:— Now we are blinker-bound. We heard still small voices then, And, in the dim serene Of Christmas Eve, Caught the fartime tones of fire-filled prophets Long on earth unseen. . . . —Can such ever have been? AFTER THE DEATH OF A FRIEND You died, and made but little of it!— Why then should I, when called to doff it, Drop, and renounce this worm-holed raiment, Shrink edgewise off from its grey claimant? Rather say, when I am Time-outrun, As you did: Take me, and have done, Inexorable, insatiate one! THE SON'S PORTRAIT I walked the streets of a market town, And came to a lumber-shop, Which I had known ere I met the frown Of fate and fortune, And habit led me to stop. In burrowing mid this chattel and that, High, low, or edgewise thrown, I lit upon something lying flat— A fly-flecked portrait, Framed. 'Twas my dead son's own. “That photo? . . . A lady—I know not whence— Sold it me, Ma'am, one day, With more. You can have it for eighteenpence: The picture's nothing; It's but for the frame you pay.” He had given it her in their heyday shine, When she wedded him, long her wooer: And then he was sent to the front-trench-line, And fell there fighting; And she took a new bridegroom to her. I bought the gift she had held so light, And buried it—as 'twere he.— Well, well! Such things are trifling, quite, But when one's lonely How cruel they can be! LYING AWAKE You, Morningtide Star, now are steady-eyed, over the east, I know it as if I saw you; You, Beeches, engrave on the sky your thin twigs, even the least; Had I paper and pencil I'd draw you. You, Meadow, are white with your counterpane cover of dew, I see it as if I were there; You, Churchyard, are lightening faint from the shade of the yew, The names creeping out everywhere. THE LADY IN THE FURS “I'm a lofty lovely woman,” Says the lady in the furs, In the glance she throws around her On the poorer dames and sirs: “This robe, that cost three figures, Yes, is mine,” her nod avers. “True, my money did not buy it, But my husband's, from the trade; And they, they only got it From things feeble and afraid By murdering them in ambush With a cunning engine's aid. “True, my hands, too, did not shape it To the pretty cut you see, But the hands of midnight workers Who are strangers quite to me: It was fitted, too, by dressers Ranged around me toilsomely. “But I am a lovely lady, Though sneerers say I shine By robbing Nature's children Of apparel not mine, And that I am but a broom-stick, Like a scarecrow's wooden spine.” CHILDHOOD AMONG THE FERNS I sat one sprinkling day upon the lea, Where tall-stemmed ferns spread out luxuriantly, And nothing but those tall ferns sheltered me. The rain gained strength, and damped each lopping frond, Ran down their stalks beside me and beyond, And shaped slow-creeping rivulets as I conned, With pride, my spray-roofed house. And though anon Some drops pierced its green rafters, I sat on, Making pretence I was not rained upon. The sun then burst, and brought forth a sweet breath From the limp ferns as they dried underneath: I said: “I could live on here thus till death”; And queried in the green rays as I sate: “Why should I have to grow to man's estate, And this afar-noised World perambulate?” A COUNTENANCE Her laugh was not in the middle of her face quite, As a gay laugh springs, It was plain she was anxious about some things I could not trace quite. Her curls were like fir-cones—piled up, brown— Or rather like tight-tied sheaves: It seemed they could never be taken down. . . . And her lips were too full, some might say: I did not think so. Anyway, The shadow her lower one would cast Was green in hue whenever she passed Bright sun on midsummer leaves. Alas, I knew not much of her, And lost all sight and touch of her! If otherwise, should I have minded The shy laugh not in the middle of her mouth quite, And would my kisses have died of drouth quite As love became unblinded? 1884. A POET'S THOUGHT It sprang up out of him in the dark, And took on the lightness of a lark: It went from his chamber along the city strand, Lingered awhile, then leapt all over the land. It came back maimed and mangled. And the poet When he beheld his offspring did not know it: Yea, verily, since its birth Time's tongue had tossed to him Such travesties that his old thought was lost to him. SILENCES There is the silence of a copse or croft When the wind sinks dumb, And of a belfry-loft When the tenor after tolling stops its hum. And there's the silence of a lonely pond Where a man was drowned, Nor nigh nor yond A newt, frog, toad, to make the merest sound. But the rapt silence of an empty house Where oneself was born, Dwelt, held carouse With friends, is of all silences most forlorn! Past are remembered songs and music-strains Once audible there: Roof, rafters, panes Look absent-thoughted, tranced, or locked in prayer. It seems no power on earth can waken it Or rouse its rooms, Or its past permit The present to stir a torpor like a tomb's. “I WATCHED A BLACKBIRD” I watched a blackbird on a budding sycamore One Easter Day, when sap was stirring twigs to the core; I saw his tongue, and crocus-coloured bill Parting and closing as he turned his trill; Then he flew down, seized on a stem of hay, And upped to where his building scheme was under way, As if so sure a nest were never shaped on spray. A NIGHTMARE, AND THE NEXT THING On this decline of Christmas Day The empty street is fogged and blurred: The house-fronts all seem backwise turned As if the outer world were spurned: Voices and songs within are heard, Whence red rays gleam when fires are stirred, Upon this nightmare Christmas Day. The lamps, just lit, begin to outloom Like dandelion-globes in the gloom; The stonework, shop-signs, doors, look bald; Curious crude details seem installed, And show themselves in their degrees As they were personalities Never discerned when the street was bustling With vehicles, and farmers hustling. Three clammy casuals wend their way To the Union House. I hear one say: “Jimmy, this is a treat! Hay-hay!” Six laughing mouths, six rows of teeth, Six radiant pairs of eyes, beneath Six yellow hats, looking out at the back Of a waggonette on its slowed-down track Up the steep street to some gay dance, Suddenly interrupt my glance. They do not see a gray nightmare Astride the day, or anywhere. TO A TREE IN LONDON (CLEMENT'S INN) Here you stay Night and day, Never, never going away! Do you ache When we take Holiday for our health's sake? Wish for feet When the heat Scalds you in the brick-built street, That you might Climb the height Where your ancestry saw light, Find a brook In some nook There to purge your swarthy look? No. You read Trees to need Smoke like earth whereon to feed. . . . Have no sense That far hence Air is sweet in a blue immense, Thus, black, blind, You have opined Nothing of your brightest kind; Never seen Miles of green, Smelt the landscape's sweet serene. 192?. THE FELLED ELM AND SHE When you put on that inmost ring She, like you, was a little thing: When your circles reached their fourth, Scarce she knew life's south from north: When your year-zones counted twenty She had fond admirers plenty: When you'd grown your twenty-second She and I were lovers reckoned: When you numbered twenty-three She went everywhere with me: When you, at your fortieth line, Showed decay, she seemed to pine: When you were quite hollow within She was felled—mere bone and skin: You too, lacking strength to grow Further trunk-rings, were laid low, Matching her; both unaware That your lives formed such a pair. HE DID NOT KNOW ME (WOMAN'S SORROW SONG) He said: “I do not know you; You are not she who came And made my heart grow tame?” I laughed: “The same!” Still said he: “I don't know you.” “But I am your Love!” laughed I: “Yours—faithful ever—till I die, And pulseless lie!” Yet he said: “I don't know you.” Freakful, I went away, And met pale Time, with “Pray, What means his Nay?” Said Time: “He does not know you In your mask of Comedy.” “But,” said I, “that I have chosen to be: Tragedy he.” “True; hence he did not know you.” “But him I could recognize?” “Yea. Tragedy is true guise, Comedy lies.” SO VARIOUS You may have met a man—quite young— A brisk-eyed youth, and highly strung: One whose desires And inner fires Moved him as wires. And you may have met one stiff and old, If not in years; of manner cold; Who seemed as stone, And never had known Of mirth or moan. And there may have crossed your path a lover, In whose clear depths you could discover A staunch, robust, And tender trust, Through storm and gust. And you may have also known one fickle, Whose fancies changed as the silver sickle Of yonder moon, Which shapes so soon To demilune! You entertained a person once Whom you internally deemed a dunce:— As he sat in view Just facing you You saw him through. You came to know a learned seer Of whom you read the surface mere: Your soul quite sank; Brain of such rank Dubbed yours a blank. Anon you quizzed a man of sadness, Who never could have known true gladness: Just for a whim You pitied him In his sore trim. You journeyed with a man so glad You never could conceive him sad: He proved to be Indubitably Good company. You lit on an unadventurous slow man, Who, said you, need be feared by no man; That his slack deeds And sloth must needs Produce but weeds. A man of enterprise, shrewd and swift, Who never suffered affairs to drift, You eyed for a time Just in his prime, And judged he might climb. You smoked beside one who forgot All that you said, or grasped it not. Quite a poor thing, Not worth a sting By satirizing! Next year you nearly lost for ever Goodwill from one who forgot slights never; And, with unease, Felt you must seize Occasion to please . . . Now. . . . All these specimens of man, So various in their pith and plan, Curious to say Were one man. Yea, I was all they. A SELF-GLAMOURER My little happiness, How much I have made of it!— As if I had been not less Than a queen, to be straight obeyed of it. “Life, be fairer far,” I said, “Than you are.” So I counted my springtime-day's Dream of futurity Enringed with golden rays To be quite a summer surety; And my trustful daring undoubt Brought it about! Events all human-wrought Had look of divinity, And what I foreframed in thought Grew substanced, by force of affinity: Visions to verities came, Seen as the same. My years in trusting spent Make to shape towardly, And fate and accident Behave not perversely or frowardly. Shall, then, Life's winter snow To me be so? THE DEAD BASTARD Many and many a time I thought, “Would my child were in its grave!” Such the trouble and shame it brought. Now 'tis there. And now I'd brave Opinion's worst, in word or act, To have that child alive; yes, slave To dress and flaunt it to attract; Show it the gossips brazenly, And let as nothing be the fact That never its father married me. THE CLASPED SKELETONS SURMISED DATE 1800 B.C. (In an Ancient British barrow near the writer's house) O why did we uncover to view So closely clasped a pair? Your chalky bedclothes over you, This long time here! Ere Paris lay with Helena— The poets' dearest dear— Ere David bedded Bathsheba You two were bedded here. Aye, even before the beauteous Jael Bade Sisera doff his gear And lie in her tent; then drove the nail, You two lay here. Wicked Aholah, in her youth, Colled loves from far and near Until they slew her without ruth; But you had long colled here. Aspasia lay with Pericles, And Philip's son found cheer At eves in lying on Thais' knees While you lay here. Cleopatra with Antony, Resigned to dalliance sheer, Lay, fatuous he, insatiate she, Long after you'd lain here. Pilate by Procula his wife Lay tossing at her tear Of pleading for an innocent life; You tossed not here. Ages before Monk Abélard Gained tender Héloïse' ear, And loved and lay with her till scarred, Had you lain loving here. So long, beyond chronology, Lovers in death as 'twere, So long in placid dignity Have you lain here! Yet what is length of time? But dream! Once breathed this atmosphere Those fossils near you, met the gleam Of day as you did here; But so far earlier theirs beside Your life-span and career, That they might style of yestertide Your coming here! IN THE MARQUEE It was near last century's ending, And, though not much to rate In a world of getting and spending, To her it was great. The scene was a London suburb On a night of summer weather, And the villas had back gardens Running together. Her neighbours behind were dancing Under a marquee; Two violoncellos played there, And violins three. She had not been invited, Although her lover was; She lay beside her husband, Perplexed at the cause. Sweet after sweet quadrille rang: Absence made her weep; The tears dried on her eyelids As she fell asleep. She dreamt she was whirling with him In this dance upon the green To which she was not invited Though her lover had been. All night she danced as he clasped her— That is, in the happy dream The music kept her dreaming Till the first daybeam. “O damn those noisy fiddles!” Her husband said as he turned: “Close to a neighbour's bedroom: I'd like them burned!” At intervals thus all night-long Her husband swore. But she Slept on, and danced in the loved arms, Under the marquee. Next day she found that her lover, Though asked, had gone elsewhere, And that she had possessed him in absence More than if there. AFTER THE BURIAL The family had buried him, Their bread-bringer, their best: They had returned to the house, whose hush a dim Vague vacancy expressed. There sat his sons, mute, rigid-faced, His daughters, strained, red-eyed, His wife, whose wan, worn features, vigil-traced, Bent over him when he died. At once a peal bursts from the bells Of a large tall tower hard by: Along the street the jocund clangour swells, And upward to the sky. Probably it was a wedding-peal, Or possibly for a birth, Or townsman knighted for political zeal, This resonant mark of mirth. The mourners, heavy-browed, sat on Motionless. Well they heard, They could not help it; nevertheless thereon Spoke not a single word, Nor window did they close, to numb The bells' insistent calls Of joy; but suffered the harassing din to come And penetrate their souls. THE MONGREL In Havenpool Harbour the ebb was strong, And a man with a dog drew near and hung, And taxpaying day was coming along, So the mongrel had to be drowned. The man threw a stick from the paved wharf-side Into the midst of the ebbing tide, And the dog jumped after with ardent pride To bring the stick aground. But no: the steady suck of the flood To seaward needed, to be withstood, More than the strength of mongrelhood To fight its treacherous trend. So, swimming for life with desperate will, The struggler with all his natant skill Kept buoyant in front of his master still There standing to wait the end. The loving eyes of the dog inclined To the man he held as a god enshrined, With no suspicion in his mind That this had all been meant. Till the effort not to drift from shore Of his little legs grew slower and slower, And, the tide still outing with brookless power, Outward the dog, too, went. Just ere his sinking what does one see Break on the face of that devotee? A wakening to the treachery He had loved with love so blind? The faith that had shone in that mongrel's eye That his owner would save him by and by Turned to much like a curse as he sank to die, And a loathing of mankind. CONCERNING AGNES I am stopped from hoping what I have hoped before— Yes, many a time!— To dance with that fair woman yet once more As in the prime Of August, when the wide-faced moon looked through The boughs at the faery lamps of the Larmer Avenue. I could not, though I should wish, have over again That old romance, And sit apart in the shade as we sat then After the dance The while I held her hand, and, to the booms Of contrabassos, feet still pulsed from the distant rooms. I could not. And you do not ask me why. Hence you infer That what may chance to the fairest under the sky Has chanced to her. Yes. She lies white, straight, features marble-keen, Unapproachable, mute, in a nook I have never seen. There she may rest like some vague goddess, shaped As out of snow; Say Aphrodite sleeping; or bedraped Like Kalupso; Or Amphitrite stretched on the Mid-sea swell, Or one of the Nine grown stiff from thought. I cannot tell! HENLEY REGATTA She looks from the window: still it pours down direly, And the avenue drips. She cannot go, she fears; And the Regatta will be spoilt entirely; And she sheds half-crazed tears. Regatta Day and rain come on together Again, years after. Gutters trickle loud; But Nancy cares not. She knows nought of weather, Or of the Henley crowd: She's a Regatta quite her own. Inanely She laughs in the asylum as she floats Within a water-tub, which she calls “Henley,” Her little paper boats. AN EVENING IN GALILEE She looks far west towards Carmel, shading her eyes with her hand, And she then looks east to the Jordan, and the smooth Tiberias' strand. “Is my son mad?” she asks; and never an answer has she, Save from herself, aghast at the possibility. “He professes as his firm faiths things far too grotesque to be true, And his vesture is odd—too careless for one of his fair young hue! . . . “He lays down doctrines as if he were old—aye, fifty at least: In the Temple he terrified me, opposing the very High-Priest! Why did he say to me, ‘Woman, what have I to do with thee?’ O it cuts to the heart that a child of mine thus spoke to me! And he said, too, ‘Who is my mother?’—when he knows so very well. He might have said, ‘Who is my father?’—and I'd found it hard to tell! That no one knows but Joseph and—one other, nor ever will; One who'll not see me again. . . . How it chanced!—I dreaming no ill! . . . “Would he'd not mix with the lowest folk—like those fishermen— The while so capable, culling new knowledge, beyond our ken! . . . That woman of no good character, ever following him, Adores him if I mistake not: his wish of her is but a whim Of his madness, it may be, outmarking his lack of coherency; After his ‘Keep the Commandments!’ to smile upon such as she! It is just what all those do who are wandering in their wit. I don't know—dare not say—what harm may grow from it. O a mad son is a terrible thing; it even may lead To arrest, and death! . . . And how he can preach, expound, and read! “Here comes my husband. Shall I unveil him this tragedy-brink? No. He has nightmares enough. I'll pray, and think, and think.” . . . She remembers she's never put on any pot for his evening meal, And pondering a plea looks vaguely to south of her—towards Jezreel. THE BROTHER O know you what I have done To avenge our sister? She, I thought, was wantoned with By a man of levity: And I lay in wait all day, All day did I wait for him, And dogged him to Bollard Head When twilight dwindled dim, And hurled him over the edge And heard him fall below: O would I were lying with him, For the truth I did not know! “O where's my husband?” she asked, As evening wore away: “Best you had one, forsooth, But never had you!” I say. “Yes, but I have!” says she, “My Love made it up with me, And we churched it yesterday And mean to live happily.” And now I go in haste To the Head, before she's aware, To join him in death for the wrong I've done them both out there! WE FIELD-WOMEN How it rained When we worked at Flintcomb-Ash, And could not stand upon the hill Trimming swedes for the slicing-mill. The wet washed through us—plash, plash, plash: How it rained! How it snowed When we crossed from Flintcomb-Ash To the Great Barn for drawing reed, Since we could nowise chop a swede.— Flakes in each doorway and casement-sash: How it snowed! How it shone When we went from Flintcomb-Ash To start at dairywork once more In the laughing meads, with cows three-score, And pails, and songs, and love—too rash: How it shone! A PRACTICAL WOMAN “O who'll get me a healthy child:— I should prefer a son— Seven have I had in thirteen years, Sickly every one! “Three mope about as feeble shapes; Weak; white; they'll be no good. One came deformed; an idiot next; And two are crass as wood. “I purpose one not only sound In flesh, but bright in mind: And duly for producing him A means I've now to find.” She went away. She disappeared, Years, years. Then back she came: In her hand was a blooming boy Mentally and in frame. “I found a father at last who'd suit The purpose in my head, And used him till he'd done his job,” Was all thereon she said. SQUIRE HOOPER Hooper was ninety. One September dawn He sent a messenger For his physician, who asked thereupon What ailed the sufferer Which he might circumvent, and promptly bid begone. “Doctor, I summoned you,” the squire replied— “Pooh-pooh me though you may— To ask what's happened to me—burst inside, It seems—not much, I'd say— But awkward with a house-full here for a shoot to-day.” And he described the symptoms. With bent head The listener looked grave. “H'm. . . . You're a dead man in six hours,” he said.— “I speak out, since you are brave— And best 'tis you should know, that last things may be sped.” “Right,” said the squire. “And now comes—what to do? One thing: on no account Must I now spoil the sport I've asked them to— My guests are paramount— They must scour scrub and stubble; and big bags bring as due.” He downed to breakfast, and bespoke his guests:— “I find I have to go An unexpected journey, and it rests With you, my friends, to show The shoot can go off gaily, whether I'm there or no.” Thus blandly spoke he; and to the fields they went, And Hooper up the stair. They had a glorious day; and stiff and spent Returned as dusk drew near.— “Gentlemen,” said the doctor, “he's not back as meant, To his deep regret!”—So they took leave, each guest Observing: “I dare say Business detains him in the town: 'tis best We should no longer stay Just now. We'll come again anon”; and they went their way. Meeting two men in the obscurity Shouldering a box a thin Cloth-covering wrapt, one sportsman cried: “Damn me, I thought them carrying in, At first, a coffin; till I knew it could not be.” “A GENTLEMAN'S SECOND-HAND SUIT” Here it is hanging in the sun By the pawn-shop door, A dress-suit—all its revels done Of heretofore. Long drilled to the waltzers' swing and sway, As its tokens show: What it has seen, what it could say If it did but know! The sleeve bears still a print of powder Rubbed from her arms When she warmed up as the notes swelled louder And livened her charms— Or rather theirs, for beauties many Leant there, no doubt, Leaving these tell-tale traces when he Spun them about. Its cut seems rather in bygone style On looking close, So it mayn't have bent it for some while To the dancing pose: Anyhow, often within its clasp Fair partners hung, Assenting to the wearer's grasp With soft sweet tongue. Where is, alas, the gentleman Who wore this suit? And where are his ladies? Tell none can: Gossip is mute. Some of them may forget him quite Who smudged his sleeve, Some think of a wild and whirling night With him, and grieve. “WE SAY WE SHALL NOT MEET” We say we shall not meet Again beneath this sky, And turn with leaden feet, Murmuring “Good-bye!” But laugh at how we rued Our former time's adieu When those who went for good Are met anew. We talk in lightest vein On trifles talked before, And part to meet again, But meet no more. SEEING THE MOON RISE We used to go to Froom-hill Barrow To see the round moon rise Into the heath-rimmed skies, Trudging thither by plough and harrow Up the pathway, steep and narrow, Singing a song. Now we do not go there. Why? Zest burns not so high! Latterly we've only conned her With a passing glance From window or door by chance, Hoping to go again, high yonder, As we used, and gaze, and ponder, Singing a song. Thitherward we do not go: Feet once quick are slow! August 1927 SONG TO AURORE We'll not begin again to love, It only leads to pain; The fire we now are master of Has seared us not in vain. Any new step of yours I'm fain To hear of from afar, And even in such may find a gain While lodged not where you are. No: that must not be done anew Which has been done before; I scarce could bear to seek, or view, Or clasp you any more! Life is a labour, death is sore, And lonely living wrings; But go your courses, Sweet Aurore, Kisses are caresome things! HE NEVER EXPECTED MUCH [or] A CONSIDERATION [A reflection] ON MY EIGHTY-SIXTH BIRTHDAY Well, World, you have kept faith with me, Kept faith with me; Upon the whole you have proved to be Much as you said you were. Since as a child I used to lie Upon the leaze and watch the sky, Never, I own, expected I That life would all be fair. 'Twas then you said, and since have said, Times since have said, In that mysterious voice you shed From clouds and hills around: “Many have loved me desperately, Many with smooth serenity, While some have shown contempt of me Till they dropped underground. “I do not promise overmuch, Child; overmuch; Just neutral-tinted haps and such,” You said to minds like mine. Wise warning for your credit's sake! Which I for one failed not to take, And hence could stem such strain and ache As each year might assign. STANDING BY THE MANTELPIECE (H. M. M., 1873) This candle-wax is shaping to a shroud To-night. (They call it that, as you may know)— By touching it the claimant is avowed, And hence I press it with my finger—so. To-night. To me twice night, that should have been The radiance of the midmost tick of noon, And close around me wintertime is seen That might have shone the veriest day of June! But since all's lost, and nothing really lies Above but shade, and shadier shade below, Let me make clear, before one of us dies, My mind to yours, just now embittered so. Since you agreed, unurged and full-advised, And let warmth grow without discouragement, Why do you bear you now as if surprised, When what has come was clearly consequent? Since you have spoken, and finality Closes around, and my last movements loom, I say no more: the rest must wait till we Are face to face again, yonside the tomb. And let the candle-wax thus mould a shape Whose meaning now, if hid before, you know, And how by touch one present claims its drape, And that it's I who press my finger—so. BOYS THEN AND NOW “More than one cuckoo?” And the little boy Seemed to lose something Of his spring joy. When he'd grown up He told his son He'd used to think There was only one, Who came each year With the trees' new trim On purpose to please England and him: And his son—old already In life and its ways— Said yawning: “How foolish Boys were in those days!” THAT KISS IN THE DARK Recall it you?— Say you do!— When you went out into the night, In an impatience that would not wait, From that lone house in the woodland spot, And when I, thinking you had gone For ever and ever from my sight, Came after, printing a kiss upon Black air In my despair, And my two lips lit on your cheek As you leant silent against a gate, Making my woman's face flush hot At what I had done in the dark, unware You lingered for me but would not speak: Yes, kissed you, thinking you were not there! Recall it you?— Say you do! A NECESSITARIAN'S EPITAPH A world I did not wish to enter Took me and poised me on my centre, Made me grimace, and foot, and prance, As cats on hot bricks have to dance Strange jigs to keep them from the floor, Till they sink down and feel no more. BURNING THE HOLLY O you are sad on Twelfth Night, I notice: sad on Twelfth Night; You are as sad on Twelfth Night As any that I know. “Yes: I am sad on that night, Doubtless I'm sad on that night: Yes; I am sad on that night, For we all loved her so!” Why are you sad on Twelfth Night, Especially on Twelfth Night? Why are you sad on Twelfth Night When wit and laughter flow? —“She'd been a famous dancer, Much lured of men; a dancer. She'd been a famous dancer, Facile in heel and toe. . . . “And we were burning the holly On Twelfth Night; the holly, As people do: the holly, Ivy, and mistletoe. “And while it popped and crackled, (She being our lodger), crackled; And while it popped and crackled, Her face caught by the glow, “In he walked and said to her, In a slow voice he said to her; Yes, walking in he said to her, ‘We sail before cock-crow.’ “‘Why did you not come on to me, As promised? Yes, come on to me? Why did you not come on to me, Since you had sworn to go?’ “His eyes were deep and flashing, As flashed the holm-flames: flashing; His eyes were deep, and flashing In their quick, keen upthrow. “As if she had been ready, Had furtively been ready; As if she had been ready For his insistence—lo!— “She clasped his arm and went with him As his entirely: went with him. She clasped his arm and went with him Into the sprinkling snow. “We saw the prickly leaves waste To ashes: saw the leaves waste; The burnt-up prickly leaves waste. . . . The pair had gone also. —“On Twelfth Night, two years after— Yes, Twelfth Night, two years after; On Twelfth Night, two years after, We sat—our spirits low— “Musing, when back the door swung Without a knock. The door swung; Thought flew to her. The door swung, And in she came, pale, slow; “Against her breast a child clasped; Close to her breast a child clasped; She stood there with the child clasped, Swaying it to and fro. “Her look alone the tale told; Quite wordless was the tale told; Her careworn eyes the tale told As larger they seemed to grow. . . . “One day next spring she disappeared, The second time she disappeared. And that time, when she'd disappeared Came back no more. Ah, no! “But we still burn the holly On Twelfth Night; burn the holly As people do: the holly, Ivy, and mistletoe.” SUSPENSE A clamminess hangs over all like a clout, The fields are a water-colour washed out, The sky at its rim leaves a chink of light, Like the lid of a pot that will not close tight. She is away by the groaning sea, Strained at the heart, and waiting for me: Between us our foe from a hid retreat Is watching, to wither us if we meet. . . . But it matters little, however we fare— Whether we meet, or I get not there; The sky will look the same thereupon, And the wind and the sea go groaning on. THE SECOND VISIT Clack, clack, clack, went the mill-wheel as I came, And she was on the bridge with the thin hand-rail, And the miller at the door, and the ducks at mill-tail; I come again years after, and all there seems the same. And so indeed it is: the apple-tree'd old house, And the deep mill-pond, and the wet wheel clacking, And a woman on the bridge, and white ducks quacking, And the miller at the door, powdered pale from boots to brows. But it's not the same miller whom long ago I knew, Nor are they the same apples, nor the same drops that dash Over the wet wheel, nor the ducks below that splash, Nor the woman who to fond plaints replied, “You know I do!” OUR OLD FRIEND DUALISM All hail to him, the Protean! A tough old chap is he: Spinoza and the Monists cannot make him cease to be. We pound him with our “Truth, Sir, please!” and quite appear to still him: He laughs; holds Bergson up, and James; and swears we cannot kill him. We argue them pragmatic cheats. “Aye,” says he. “They're deceiving: But I must live; for flamens plead I am all that's worth believing!” 1920. FAITHFUL WILSON “I say she's handsome, by all laws Of beauty, if wife ever was!” Wilson insists thus, though each day The years fret Fanny towards decay. “She was once beauteous as a jewel,” Hint friends; “but Time, of course, is cruel.” Still Wilson does not quite feel how, Once fair, she can be different now. Partly from Strato of Sardis. GALLANT'S SONG When the maiden leaves off teasing, Then the man may leave off pleasing: Yea, 'tis sign, Wet or fine, She will love him without ceasing With a love there's no appeasing. Is it so? Ha-ha. Ho! Nov. 1868. From an old notebook. A PHILOSOPHICAL FANTASY “Milton . . . made God argue.” —Walter Bagehot. “Well, if thou wilt, then, ask me; To answer will not task me: I've a response, I doubt not. And quite agree to flout not Thy question, if of reason, Albeit not quite in season: A universe to marshal, What god can give but partial Eye to frail Earth—life-shotten Ere long, extinct, forgotten!— But seeing indications That thou read'st my limitations, And since my lack of forethought Aggrieves thy more and more thought, I'll hearken to thy pleading: Some lore may lie in heeding Thy irregular proceeding.” “'Tis this unfulfilled intention, O Causer, I would mention:— Will you, in condescension This evening, ere we've parted, Say why you felt fainthearted, And let your aim be thwarted, Its glory be diminished, Its concept stand unfinished?— Such I ask you, Sir or Madam, (I know no more than Adam, Even vaguely, what your sex is,— Though feminine I had thought you Till seers as ‘Sire’ besought you;— And this my ignorance vexes Some people not a little, And, though not me one tittle, It makes me sometimes choose me Call you ‘It,’ if you'll excuse me?”) “Call me ‘It’ with a good conscience, And be sure it is all nonsense That I mind a fault of manner In a pigmy towards his planner! Be I, be not I, sexless, I am in nature vexless. —How vain must clay-carved man be To deem such folly can be As that freaks of my own framing Can set my visage flaming— Start me volleying interjections Against my own confections, As the Jews and others limned me, And in fear and trembling hymned me! Call me ‘but dream-projected,’ I shall not be affected; Call me ‘blind force persisting,’ I shall remain unlisting; (A few have done it lately, And, maybe, err not greatly.) —Another such a vanity In witless weak humanity Is thinking that of those all Through space at my disposal, Man's shape must needs resemble Mine, that makes zodiacs tremble! “Continuing where we started:— As for my aims being thwarted, Wherefore I feel fainthearted, Aimless am I, revealing No heart-scope for faint feeling. —But thy mistake I'll pardon, And, as Adam's mentioned to me, (Though in timeless truth there never Was a man like him whatever) I'll meet thee in thy garden, As I did not him, beshrew me! In the sun of so-called daytime— Say, just about the Maytime Of my next, or next, Creation? (I love procrastination, To use the words in thy sense, Which have no hold on my sense) Or at any future stray-time.— One of thy representatives In some later incarnation I mean, of course, well knowing Thy present conformation But a unit of my tentatives, Whereof such heaps lie blowing As dust, where thou art going; Yea, passed to where suns glow not, Begrieved of those that go not (Though what grief is, I know not.) “Perhaps I may inform thee, In case I should alarm thee, That no dramatic stories Like ancient ones whose core is A mass of superstition And monkish imposition Will mark my explanation Of the world's sore situation (As thou tell'st), with woes that shatter; Though from former aions to latter To me 'tis malleable matter For treatment scientific More than sensitive and specific— Stuff without moral features, Which I've no sense of ever, Or of ethical endeavour, Or of justice to Earth's creatures, Or how Right from Wrong to sever: Let these be as men learn such; For me, I don't discern such, And—real enough I daresay— I know them but by hearsay As something Time hath rendered Out of substance I engendered, Time, too, being a condition Beyond my recognition. —I would add that, while unknowing Of this justice earthward owing, Nor explanation offering Of what is meant by suffering, Thereof I'm not a spurner, Or averse to be a learner. “To return from wordy wandering To the question we are pondering; Though, viewing the world in my mode, I fail to see it in thy mode As ‘unfulfilled intention,’ Which is past my comprehension Being unconscious in my doings So largely, (whence thy rueings);— Aye, to human tribes nor kindlessness Nor love I've given, but mindlessness, Which state, though far from ending, May nevertheless be mending. “However, I'll advise him— Him thy scion, who will walk here When Death hath dumbed thy talk here— In phrase that may surprise him, What thing it was befel me, (A thing that my confessing Lack of forethought helps thy guessing), And acted to compel me By that purposeless propension Which is mine, and not intention, Along lines of least resistance, Or, in brief, unsensed persistence, That saddens thy existence To think my so-called scheming Not that of my first dreaming.” 1920 and 1926. A QUESTION OF MARRIAGE “I yield you my whole heart, Countess,” said he; “Come, Dear, and be queen of my studio.” “No, sculptor. You're merely my friend,” said she: “We dine our artists; but marry them—no.” “Be it thus,” he replied. And his love, so strong, He subdued as a stoic should. Anon He wived some damsel who'd loved him long, Of lineage noteless; and chiselled on. And a score years passed. As a master-mind The world made much of his marching fame, And his wife's little charms, with his own entwined, Won day after day increased acclaim. The countess-widow had closed with a mate In rank and wealth of her own degree, And they moved among the obscurely great Of an order that had no novelty. And oldening—neither with blame nor praise— Their stately lives begot no stir, And she saw that when death should efface her days All men would abandon thought of her; And said to herself full gloomily: “Far better for me had it been to shine The wench of a genius such as he Than rust as the wife of a spouse like mine!” THE LETTER'S TRIUMPH (A FANCY) Yes: I perceive it's to your Love You are bent on sending me. That this is so Your words and phrases prove! And now I am folded, and start to go, Where you, my writer, have no leave to come: My entry none will know! And I shall catch her eye, and dumb She'll keep, should my unnoised arrival be Hoped for, or troublesome. My face she'll notice readily: And, whether she care to meet you, or care not, She will perforce meet me; Take me to closet or garden-plot And, blushing or pouting, bend her eyes quite near, Moved much, or never a jot. And while you wait in hope and fear, Far from her cheeks and lips, snug I shall stay In close communion there, And hear her heart-beats, things she may say, As near her naked fingers, sleeve, or glove I lie—ha-ha!—all day. A FORGOTTEN MINIATURE There you are in the dark, Deep in a box Nobody ever unlocks, Or even turns to mark; —Out of mind stark. Yet there you have not been worsed Like your sitter By Time, the Fair's hard-hitter; Your beauties, undispersed, Glow as at first. Shut in your case for years, Never an eye Of the many passing nigh, Fixed on their own affairs, Thinks what it nears! —While you have lain in gloom, A form forgot, Your reign remembered not, Much life has come to bloom Within this room. Yea, in Time's cyclic sweep Unrest has ranged: Women and men have changed: Some you knew slumber deep; Some wait for sleep. WHISPERED AT THE CHURCH-OPENING In the bran-new pulpit the bishop stands, And gives out his text, as his gaze expands To the people, the aisles, the roof's new frame, And the arches, and ashlar with coloured bands. “Why—he's the man,” says one, “who came To preach in my boyhood—a fashion then— In a series of sermons to working-men On week-day evenings, a novelty Which brought better folk to hear and see. They preached each one each week, by request: Some were eloquent speakers, among the best Of the lot being this, as all confessed.” “I remember now. And reflection brings Back one in especial, sincerest of all; Whose words, though unpicked, gave the essence of things;— And where is he now, whom I well recall?” “Oh, he'd no touches of tactic skill: His mind ran on charity and good will: He's but as he was, a vicar still.” IN WEATHERBURY STOCKS (1850) “I sit here in these stocks, And Saint-Mary's moans eleven; The sky is dark and cold: I would I were in heaven! “What footsteps do I hear? Ah, you do not forget, My Sophy! O, my dear, We may be happy yet! “But—. Mother, is't your voice? You who have come to me?— It did not cross my thought: I was thinking it was she.” “She! Foolish simple son! She says: ‘I've finished quite With him or any one Put in the stocks to-night.’ “She's gone to Blooms-End dance, And will not come back yet: Her new man sees his chance, And is teaching her to forget. “Jim, think no other woman To such a fellow is true But the mother you have grieved so, Or cares for one like you!” A PLACID MAN'S EPITAPH As for my life, I've led it With fair content and credit: It said: “Take this.” I took it. Said: “Leave.” And I forsook it. If I had done without it None would have cared about it, Or said: “One has refused it Who might have meetly used it.” 1925. THE NEW BOOTS “They are his new boots,” she pursued; “They have not been worn at all: They stay there hung on the wall, And are getting as stiff as wood. He bought them for the wet weather, And they are of waterproof leather.” “Why does her husband,” said I, “Never wear those boots bought new?” To a neighbour of hers I knew; Who answered: “Ah, those boots. Aye, He bought them to wear whenever It rained. But there they hang ever. “‘Yes,’ he laughed, as he hung them up, ‘I've got them at last—a pair I can walk in anywhere Through rain and slush and slop. For many a year I've been haunted By thoughts of how much they were wanted.’ “And she's not touched them or tried To remove them. . . . Anyhow, As you see them hanging now They have hung ever since he died The day after gaily declaring: ‘Ha-ha! Now for wet wayfaring. They're just the chaps for my wearing!’” THE MUSING MAIDEN “Why so often, silent one, Do you steal away alone?” Starting, half she turned her head, And guiltily she said:— “When the vane points to his far town I go upon the hog-backed down, And think the breeze that stroked his lip Over my own may slip. “When he walks at close of day I ramble on the white highway, And think it reaches to his feet: A meditation sweet! “When coasters hence to London sail I watch their puffed wings waning pale; His window opens near the quay; Their coming he can see. “I go to meet the moon at night; To mark the moon was our delight; Up there our eyesights touch at will If such he practise still.” W.P.V. October 1866 (recopied). LORNA THE SECOND Lorna! Yes, you are sweet, But you are not your mother, Lorna the First, frank, feat, Never such another!— Love of her could smother Griefs by day or night; Nor could any other, Lorna, dear and bright, Ever so well adorn a Mansion, coach, or cot, Or so make men scorn a Rival in their sight; Even you could not! Hence I have to mourn a Loss ere you were born; a Lorna! A DAUGHTER RETURNS I like not that dainty-cut raiment, those earrings of pearl, I like not the light in that eye; I like not the note of that voice. Never so was the girl Who a year ago bade me good-bye! Hadst but come bare and moneyless, worn in the vamp, weather-gray, But innocent still as before, How warmly I'd lodged thee! But sport thy new gains far away; I pray thee now—come here no more! And yet I'll not try to blot out every memory of thee; I'll think of thee—yes, now and then: One who's watched thee since Time called thee out o' thy mother and me Must think of thee; aye, I know when! . . . When the cold sneer of dawn follows night-shadows black as a hearse, And the rain filters down the fruit tree, And the tempest mouths into the flue-top a word like a curse, Then, then I shall think, think of thee! December 17, 1901. THE THIRD KISSING-GATE She foots it forward down the town, Then leaves the lamps behind, And trots along the eastern road Where elms stand double-lined. She clacks the first dim kissing-gate Beneath the storm-strained trees, And passes to the second mead That fringes Mellstock Leaze. She swings the second kissing-gate Next the gray garden-wall, And sees the third mead stretching down Towards the waterfall. And now the third-placed kissing-gate Her silent shadow nears, And touches with; when suddenly Her person disappears. What chanced by that third kissing-gate When the hushed mead grew dun? Lo—two dark figures clasped and closed As if they were but one. DRINKING SONG Once on a time when thought began Lived Thales: he Was said to see Vast truths that mortals seldom can; It seems without A moment's doubt That everything was made for man. Chorus. Fill full your cups: feel no distress That thoughts so great should now be less! Earth mid the sky stood firm and flat, He held, till came A sage by name Copernicus, and righted that. We trod, he told, A globe that rolled Around a sun it warmed it at. Chorus. Fill full your cups: feel no distress; 'Tis only one great thought the less! But still we held, as Time flew by And wit increased, Ours was, at least, The only world whose rank was high: Till rumours flew From folk who knew Of globes galore about the sky. Chorus. Fill full your cups: fell no distress; 'Tis only one great thought the less! And that this earth, our one estate, Was no prime ball, The best of all, But common, mean; indeed, tenth-rate: And men, so proud, A feeble crowd, Unworthy any special fate. Chorus. Fill full your cups: feel no distress; 'Tis only one great thought the less! Then rose one Hume, who could not see, If earth were such, Required were much To prove no miracles could be: “Better believe The eyes deceive Than that God's clockwork jolts,” said he. Chorus. Fill full your cups: feel no distress; 'Tis only one great thought the less! Next this strange message Darwin brings, (Though saying his say In a quiet way); We all are one with creeping things; And apes and men Blood-brethren, And likewise reptile forms with stings. Chorus. Fill full your cups: feel no distress; 'Tis only one great thought the less! And when this philosoph had done Came Doctor Cheyne: Speaking plain he Proved no virgin bore a son. “Such tale, indeed, Helps not our creed,” He said. “A tale long known to none.” Chorus. Fill full your cups: feel no distress; 'Tis only one great thought the less! And now comes Einstein with a notion— Not yet quite clear To many here— That's there's no time, no space, no motion, Nor rathe nor late, Nor square nor straight, But just a sort of bending-ocean. Chorus. Fill full your cups: feel no distress; 'Tis only one great thought the less! So here we are, in piteous case: Like butterflies Of many dyes Upon an Alpine glacier's face: To fly and cower In some warm bower Our chief concern in such a place. Chorus. Fill full your cups: feel no distress At all our great thoughts shrinking less: We'll do a good deed nevertheless! THE TARRYING BRIDEGROOM Wildly bound the bells this morning For the glad solemnity; People are adorning Chancel and canopy; But amid the peal a warning Under-echo calls to me. Where the lane divides the pasture Long I watch each bend and stone, Why not now as last year, When he sought me—lone? Come, O come, and see, and cast here Light and love on one your own! How it used to draw him to me, When I piped a pretty tune; Yes, when first he knew me In my pink shalloon: Little I guessed 'twould so undo me Lacking him this summer noon! THE DESTINED PAIR Two beings were drifting Each one to the other: No moment's veil-lifting Or hint from another Led either to weet That the tracks of their feet Were arcs that would meet. One moved in a city, And one in a village, Where many a ditty He tongued when at tillage On dreams of a dim Figure fancy would limn That was viewless to him. Would Fate have been kinder To keep night between them?— Had he failed to find her And time never seen them Unite; so that, caught In no burning love-thought, She had faded unsought? A MUSICAL INCIDENT When I see the room it hurts me As with a pricking blade, Those women being the memoried reason why my cheer deserts me.— 'Twas thus. One of them played To please her friend, not knowing That friend was speedily growing, Behind the player's chair, Somnolent, unaware Of any music there. I saw it, and it distressed me, For I had begun to think I loved the drowsy listener, when this arose to test me And tug me from love's brink. “Beautiful!” said she, waking As the music ceased. “Heart-aching!” Though never a note she'd heard To judge of as averred— Save that of the very last word. All would have faded in me, But that the sleeper brought News a week thence that her friend was dead. It stirred within me Sense of injustice wrought That dead player's poor intent— So heartily, kindly meant— As blandly added the sigher: “How glad I am I was nigh her, To hear her last tune!”—“Liar!” I lipped.—This gave love pause, And killed it, such as it was. JUNE LEAVES AND AUTUMN I Lush summer lit the trees to green; But in the ditch hard by Lay dying boughs some hand unseen Had lopped when first with festal mien They matched their mates on high. It seemed a melancholy fate That leaves but brought to birth so late Should rust there, red and numb, In quickened fall, while all their race Still joyed aloft in pride of place With store of days to come. II At autumn-end I fared that way, And traced those boughs fore-hewn Whose leaves, awaiting their decay In slowly browning shades, still lay Where they had lain in June And now, no less embrowned and curst Than if they had fallen with the first, Nor known a morning more, Lay there alongside, dun and sere, Those that at my last wandering here Had length of days in store. November 19, 1898. NO BELL-RINGING A BALLAD OF DURNOVER The little boy legged on through the dark, To hear the New-Year's ringing: The three-mile road was empty, stark, No sound or echo bringing. When he got to the tall church tower Standing upon the hill, Although it was hard on the midnight hour The place was, as elsewhere, still; Except that the flag-staff rope, betossed By blasts from the nor'-east, Like a dead man's bones on a gibbet-post Tugged as to be released. “Why is there no ringing to-night?” Said the boy to a moveless one On a tombstone where the moon struck white; But he got answer none. “No ringing in of New Year's Day.” He mused as he dragged back home; And wondered till his head was gray Why the bells that night were dumb. And often thought of the snowy shape That sat on the moonlit stone, Nor spoke nor moved, and in mien and drape Seemed like a sprite thereon. And then he met one left of the band That had treble-bobbed when young, And said: “I never could understand Why, that night, no bells rung.” “True. There'd not happened such a thing For half a century; aye, And never I've told why they did not ring From that time till to-day. . . . “Through the week in bliss at The Hit or Miss An old tavern now demolished. The full legend over the door ran, “Hit or Miss: Luck's All!” We had drunk—not a penny left; What then we did—well, now 'tis hid,— But better we'd stooped to theft! “Yet, since none other remains who can, And few more years are mine, I may tell you,” said the cramped old man. “We—swilled the Sacrament-wine. “Then each set-to with the strength of two, Every man to his bell; But something was wrong we found ere long Though what, we could not tell. “We pulled till the sweat-drops fell around, As we'd never pulled before, An hour by the clock, but not one sound Came down through the bell-loft floor. “On the morrow all folk of the same thing spoke, They had stood at the midnight time On their doorsteps near with a listening ear, But there reached them never a chime. “We then could read the dye of our deed, And we knew we were accurst; But we broke to none the thing we had done, And since then never durst.” “I LOOKED BACK” I looked back as I left the house, And, past the chimneys and neighbour tree, The moon upsidled through the boughs:— I thought: “I shall a last time see This picture; when will that time be?” I paused amid the laugh-loud feast, And selfward said: “I am sitting where, Some night, when ancient songs have ceased, ‘Now is the last time I shall share Such cheer,’” will be the thought I bear. An eye-sweep back at a look-out corner Upon a hill, as forenight wore, Stirred me to think: “Ought I to warn her That, though I come here times three-score, One day 'twill be I come no more?” Anon I reasoned there had been, Ere quite forsaken was each spot, Bygones whereon I'd lastly seen That house, that feast, that maid forgot; But when?—Ah, I remembered not! THE AGED NEWSPAPER SOLILOQUIZES Yes; yes; I am old. In me appears The history of a hundred years; Empires', kings', captives', births and deaths, Strange faiths, and fleeting shibboleths. —Tragedy, comedy, throngs my page Beyond all mummed on any stage: Cold hearts beat hot, hot hearts beat cold, And I beat on. Yes; yes; I am old. CHRISTMAS: 1924 “Peace upon earth!” was said. We sing it, And pay a million priests to bring it. After two thousand years of mass We've got as far as poison-gas. 1924. THE SINGLE WITNESS “Did no one else, then, see them, man, Lying among the whin? Did no one else, behold them at all Commit this shameless sin, But you, in the hollow of the down No traveller's eye takes in?” “Nobody else, my noble lord, Saw them together there— Your young son's tutor and she. I made A short cut from the fair, And lit on them. I've said no word About it anywhere.” “Good. . . . Now, you see my father's sword, Hanging up in your view; No hand has swung it since he came Home after Waterloo. I'll show it you. . . . There is the sword: And this is what I'll do.” He ran the other through the breast, Ere he could plead or cry. “It is a dire necessity, But—since no one was nigh Save you and they, my historied name Must not be smirched thereby.” HOW SHE WENT TO IRELAND Dora's gone to Ireland Through the sleet and snow: Promptly she has gone there In a ship, although Why she's gone to Ireland Dora does not know. That was where, yea, Ireland, Dora wished to be: When she felt, in lone times, Shoots of misery, Often there, in Ireland, Dora wished to be. Hence she's gone to Ireland, Since she meant to go, Through the drift and darkness Onward labouring, though That she's gone to Ireland Dora does not know. DEAD “WESSEX” THE DOG TO THE HOUSEHOLD Do you think of me at all, Wistful ones? Do you think of me at all As if nigh? Do you think of me at all At the creep of evenfall, Or when the sky-birds call As they fly? Do you look for me at times, Wistful ones? Do you look for me at times Strained and still? Do you look for me at times, When the hour for walking chimes, On that grassy path that climbs Up the hill? You may hear a jump or trot, Wistful ones, You may hear a jump or trot— Mine, as 'twere— You may hear a jump or trot On the stair or path or plot; But I shall cause it not, Be not there. Should you call as when I knew you, Wistful ones, Should you call as when I knew you, Shared your home; Should you call as when I knew you, I shall not turn to view you, I shall not listen to you, Shall not come. THE WOMAN WHO WENT EAST “Where is that woman of the west, Good Sir, once friends with me, In rays of her own rareness drest, And fired by sunset from the sea? Yes, she—once friends with me.” “—She went to sojourn in the east, O stranger Dame, one day; Her own west land she reckoned least Of all lands, with its weird old way, So left it, Dame, one day: “Doubtless they prized her marvellous mould At its right worth elsewhere, Yea, Dame, and kept her shrined in gold, So speaking, as one past compare; Aye, prized her worth elsewhere!” —“Must, must I then a story tell, Old native, here to you, Of peradventures that befel Her eastward—shape it as 'twere new, Old native, here to you? “O unforgotten day long back, When, wilful, east she sped From you with her new Love. Alack, Her lips would still be ripe and red Had she not eastward sped! “For know, old lover, dull of eyes, That woman, I am she: This skeleton that Time so tries Your rose of rareness used to be; Yes, sweetheart, I am she.” NOT KNOWN They know the wilings of the world, The latest flippancy; They know each jest at hazard hurled, But know not me. They know a phasm they name as me, In whom I should not find A single self-held quality Of body or mind. THE BOY'S DREAM Provincial town-boy he,—frail, lame, His face a waning lily-white, A court the home of his wry, wrenched frame, Where noontide shed no warmth or light. Over his temples—flat and wan, Where bluest veins were patterned keen, The skin appeared so thinly drawn The skull beneath was almost seen. Always a wishful, absent look Expressed it in his face and eye; At the strong shape this longing took One guessed what wish must underlie. But no. That wish was not for strength, For other boys' agility, To race with ease the field's far length, Now hopped across so painfully. He minded not his lameness much, To shine at feats he did not long, Nor to be best at goal and touch, Nor at assaults to stand up strong. But sometimes he would let be known What the wish was:—to have, next spring, A real green linnet—his very own— Like that one he had late heard sing. And as he breathed the cherished dream To those whose secrecy was sworn, His face was beautified by the theme, And wore the radiance of the morn. THE GAP IN THE WHITE (178?) Something had cracked in her mouth as she slept, Having danced with the Prince long, and sipped his gold tass; And she woke in alarm, and quick, breathlessly, leapt Out of bed to the glass. And there, in the blue dawn, her mouth now displayed To her woe, in the white Level line of her teeth, a black gap she had made In a dream's nervous bite. “O how can I meet him to-morrow!” she said. “I'd won him—yes, yes! Now, alas, he is lost!” (That age knew no remedy.) Duly her dread Proved the truth, to her cost. And if you could go and examine her grave You'd find the gap there, But not understand, now that science can save, Her unbounded despair. FAMILY PORTRAITS Three picture-drawn people stepped out of their frames— The blast, how it blew! And the white-shrouded candles flapped smoke-headed flames; —Three picture-drawn people came down from their frames, And dumbly in lippings they told me their names, Full well though I knew. The first was a maiden of mild wistful tone, Gone silent for years, The next a dark woman in former time known; But the first one, the maiden of mild wistful tone, So wondering, unpractised, so vague and alone, Nigh moved me to tears. The third was a sad man—a man of much gloom; And before me they passed In the shade of the night, at the back of the room, The dark and fair woman, the man of much gloom, Three persons, in far-off years forceful, but whom Death now fettered fast. They set about acting some drama, obscure, The women and he, With puppet-like movements of mute strange allure; Yea, set about acting some drama, obscure, Till I saw 'twas their own lifetime's tragic amour, Whose course begot me; Yea—a mystery, ancestral, long hid from my reach In the perished years past, That had mounted to dark doings each against each In those ancestors' days, and long hid from my reach; Which their restless enghostings, it seemed, were to teach Me in full, at this last. But fear fell upon me like frost, of some hurt If they entered anew On the orbits they smartly had swept when expert In the law-lacking passions of life,—of some hurt To their souls—and thus mine—which I fain would avert So, in sweat cold as dew, “Why wake up all this?” I cried out. “Now, so late! Let old ghosts be laid!” And they stiffened, drew back to their frames and numb state, Gibbering: “Thus are your own ways to shape, know too late!” Then I grieved that I'd not had the courage to wait And see the play played. I have grieved ever since: to have balked future pain, My blood's tendance foreknown, Had been triumph. Nights long stretched awake I have lain Perplexed in endeavours to balk future pain By uncovering the drift of their drama. In vain, Though therein lay my own. THE CATCHING BALLET OF THE WEDDING CLOTHES (Temp. Guliel IV.) “A gentleman's coming To court me, they say; The ringers are told, And the band is to play. O why should he do it Now poor Jack's away? I surely shall rue it: Come, white witch, and say!” “The gentleman's coming To marry you, dear; They tell at the turnpikes That he has been here! He rode here in secret, To gain eye of you:— Throw over the sailor, Is what I should do!” “I will not throw over Poor Jack: no, indeed, For a new unknown lover Who loves at such speed, And writes to the ringers, And orders the band, As if I could only Obey his command! “La! now here is something Close packed in a box, And strapped up and corded, And held with two locks!” “Dear, that's from him, surely, As we may suppose? Ay, through the chink shining I spy wedding clothes!” “Yes—here's a drawn bonnet, And tortoiseshell combs, And a silk gown, silk stockings, And scents of rare blooms; And shoes, too, of satin, Quite past all my pride: O, how will it end, witch; I can't be his bride!” “Don't waste you in weeping: Not worth it is man! Beshrew me, my deary, I've shaped a new plan. Wear the clothes of the rich one, Since he will not see, But marry the poor one You love faithfully.” “Here's a last packet. . . . Never! It knocks me to bits— The ring! ‘Just to try on, To see if it fits.” O I cannot!” . . . But Jack said, Quite cool, when he came, “Well, it will save money, And be just the same.” The marriage took place, Yes; as vowed, she was true To her dear sailor Jack Ere the gentleman knew; But she wore the rich clothing, Much joyed at such guise, Yet fearing and trembling With tears in her eyes. And at midnight, between her And him she had wed, The gentleman's figure Arose up and said: “My too-cruel darling, In spite of your oaths, You have married the man Of the ring and the clothes!” Thence on, would confront her, When sleep had grown slack, His face on the pillow Between her and Jack; And he nightly kept whispering: “You surely must see, Though your tongue-tip took him, Love, Your body took me.” Till she sighed: “Yes, my word, It must be confessed o' me, Jack has; but this man Can claim all the rest o' me! And off to go with him Bewitched am I now: I'd fain not be two men's, And won't, anyhow!” So she pleaded and pleaded From daybreak till dark, Converting the parish (Save parson and clerk). She then wrote to Jack thus: “I'm torn with mind-strife: She who wears a man's bride-clothes Must be the man's wife!” And still she kept plaining, Till Jack he wrote: “Aye!” And the villagers gathered, And on a fixed day, They went out alertly And stood in a row, Quite blithe with excitement To see John's wife go. Some were facing her dwelling, And some on the bridge, And some at the corner, And some by the ridge. With a nod and a word The coach stopped at her door, And she upped like a bird, And they saw her no more. 'Twas told that, years after, When autumn winds wave, A wealthy old lady Stood long at Jack's grave, And while her coach waited:— She mused there; and then She stepped in, and never Came thither again. 1919. A WINSOME WOMAN SONG There's no winsome woman so winsome as she; Some are flower-like in mouth, Some have fire in the eyes, Some feed a soul's drouth Trilling words music-wise; But where are these gifts all in one found to be Save in her known to me? What her thoughts are I read not, but this much I know, That she, too, will pass From the sun and the air To her cave under grass; And the world will declare, “No such woman as his passioned utterances show Walked this planet, we trow!” THE BALLAD OF LOVE'S SKELETON (179?) “Come, let's to Culliford Hill and Wood, And watch the squirrels climb, And look in sunny places there For shepherds' thyme.” —“Can I have heart for Culliford Wood, And hill and bank and tree, Who know and ponder over all Things done by me!” —“Then, Dear, don hat, and come along: We'll strut the Royal strand; King George has just arrived, his Court, His guards, and band.” —“You are a Baron of the King's Court From Hanover lately come, And can forget in song and dance What chills me numb. “Well be the royal scenes for you, And band beyond compare, But how is she who hates her crime To frolic there? “O why did you so urge and say 'Twould soil your noble name!— I should have prized a little child, And faced the shame. “I see the child—that should have been, But was not, born alive; With such a deed in a woman's life A year seems five. “I asked not for the wifely rank, Nor maiden honour saved; To call a nestling thing my own Was all I craved. “For what's the hurt of shame to one Of no more note than me? Can littlest life beneath the sun More littled be?” —“Nay, never grieve. The day is bright, Just as it was ere then: In the Assembly Rooms to-night Let's joy again! “The new Quick-Step is the sweetest dance For lively toes and heels; And when we tire of that we'll prance Bewitching reels. “Dear, never grieve! As once we whirled So let us whirl to-night, Forgetting all things save ourselves Till dawning light. “The King and Queen, Princesses three, Have promised to meet there The mayor and townsfolk. I've my card And One to spare. “The Court will dance at the upper end; Only a cord between Them and the burgher-throng below; A brilliant scene!” —“I'll go. You've still my heart in thrall: Save you, all's dark to me. And God knows what, when love is all, The end will be!” A PRIVATE MAN ON PUBLIC MEN When my contemporaries were driving Their coach through Life with strain and striving, And raking riches into heaps, And ably pleading in the Courts With smart rejoinders and retorts, Or where the Senate nightly keeps Its vigils, till their fames were fanned By rumour's tongue throughout the land, I lived in quiet, screened, unknown, Pondering upon some stick or stone, Or news of some rare book or bird Latterly bought, or seen, or heard, Not wishing ever to set eyes on The surging crowd beyond the horizon, Tasting years of moderate gladness Mellowed by sundry days of sadness, Shut from the noise of the world without, Hearing but dimly its rush and rout, Unenvying those amid its roar, Little endowed, not wanting more. CHRISTMAS IN THE ELGIN ROOM BRITISH MUSEUM: EARLY LAST CENTURY “What is the noise that shakes the night, And seems to soar to the Pole-star height?” —“Christmas bells, The watchman tells Who walks this hall that blears us captives with its blight.” “And what, then, mean such clangs, so clear?” “—'Tis said to have been a day of cheer, And source of grace To the human race Long ere their woven sails winged us to exile here. “We are those whom Christmas overthrew Some centuries after Pheidias knew How to shape us And bedrape us And to set us in Athena's temple for men's view. “O it is sad now we are sold— We gods! for Borean people's gold, And brought to the gloom Of this gaunt room Which sunlight shuns, and sweet Aurore but enters cold. “For all these bells, would I were still Radiant as on Athenai's Hill.” —“And I, and I!” The others sigh, “Before this Christ was known, and we had men's good will.” Thereat old Helios could but nod, Throbbed, too, the Ilissus River-god, And the torsos there Of deities fair, Whose limbs were shards beneath some Acropolitan clod: Demeter too, Poseidon hoar, Persephone, and many more Of Zeus' high breed,— All loth to heed What the bells sang that night which shook them to the core. 1905 and 1926. “WE ARE GETTING TO THE END” We are getting to the end of visioning The impossible within this universe, Such as that better whiles may follow worse, And that our race may mend by reasoning. We know that even as larks in cages sing Unthoughtful of deliverance from the curse That holds them lifelong in a latticed hearse, We ply spasmodically our pleasuring. And that when nations set them to lay waste Their neighbours' heritage by foot and horse, And hack their pleasant plains in festering seams, They may again,—not warely, or from taste, But tickled mad by some demonic force.— Yes. We are getting to the end of dreams! HE RESOLVES TO SAY NO MORE O my soul, keep the rest unknown! It is too like a sound of moan When the charnel-eyed Pale Horse has nighed: Yea, none shall gather what I hide! Why load men's minds with more to bear That bear already ails to spare? From now alway Till my last day What I discern I will not say. Let Time roll backward if it will; (Magians who drive the midnight quill With brain aglow Can see it so,) What I have learnt no man shall know. And if my vision range beyond The blinkered sight of souls in bond, —By truth made free— I'll let all be, And show to no man what I see.</field>
